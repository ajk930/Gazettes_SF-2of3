probable that Miss Shaldon was awakened

has a deep significance with the police.

Sheldon said she knew nothing. of thÂ«s

The same point was involved In an at

providing such precedure passed by the

removal of the famou3 mining suit, known
as the Hale & Norcross case " from - the
jurisdiction of Judge Heb"bard of the Su-'

the case had . been assigned. Under: the
procedure then, and now. when a litigant
alleges bias upon the part of the Judge
trying his case v he. must file with that,
pame Judge affidavits ; to. prove bias, and,
that Judge is the 'One who passes, upon
the affidavits.' It, was alleged four years
ago that this was. 'In: effect. 'a: Judge -leg-.
iplatlnr; upon himself, and that the situa
tion was illogical and absurd.,. It': was
urged that when a litigant believed- his
Judge was biased, to file an affidavit', to
that, effect and haVo it fail pf achieving a
transfer, would be to make matters worse
than they were, : and therefore . the only
safe way was to have the' filing of an"af
fidavit alleging bias sufficient to compel
the- trial Judge to. transfer the case to
some other department. . :
A biHprovidlng this was beaten in the

GALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 3.-For a body that
has earned & reputation for being
slow, : the ' present Assembly has
managed to put in rather a hur
ried week since last-Sunday. With ses
sions and committees going as usual, It
has found time to raise riot with the Parl3
Commission, to threaten investigation o.
the San' Francisco Police Department, to
fight four times over health bills that the
Governor Is forcing through, and to do
various -other turns on the side that take
time and add to. the ffay.ety and interest
of nations.. :
The Senate for the srast week has been
like a horse cone lame, for it has been,
in a seven days' fear of a quorum lack
ing. A good part of }iv membership has
been junketing through the south as far
as San Diego, and as a consequence mow
than once It would have taken only two
or three negative votes to kill a bill. As
a consequWe important measures have
been passed on file until there Is left a
fine list for the Senate to act upon thl3
week. " â¢
The House has kept to its work, how
ever, capering gleefully in the light It in
tends to turn upon commissions, and police
departments and such things, and rowing
over the State's health. .
Those blUs from the Governor bear the
stamp of 'Tush legislation" if ever there
was euch a Jthing. They were given to t.ho
Sneaker of the. House to Introduce, and
the wisdom" of the selection is shown by
the fact that it Is due to his efforts as a
presiding officer that tho bills have trotted
along In the 2:10 class and have reached
the wire scr far ahead of time, for in no
case did he yield his place to tho Speaker
pro tern. The result would have been the
same, but It would have looked better.
The efforts of the Speaker have been
assisted materially by a certain parlia
mentary shyness on the part of the op
position; or, perhaps, it was merely, that
the opposition leaders were not quick of
wit. On Friday last, by>a vote of A2, to 23,
a bare majority of those present, the bills
were made a special order for baturdav.
No one raised the olntof order that the
vote was not sufficient, and no one had the
: wit to demand a roil call. On Saturday
morning, while JohnEon, Fisk. Kincald
and a half dozen others were scurrying
around the Assembly chamber in a fran
tic endeavor to drum up another vote or
1 two, not one of the opposition had th*
I foresight to demand toot the result of tiie
! roll -call be announced, although It wa.Â»
i hanging fire for. ten minutes. And then,
to cap it all.'Feliz. a Democrat, who had
opposed the bill as a saint would oppose
Satan arose and changed his vote from
"no" 'to "aye" in order that he might
reconsider a vote that had already ginvs
as he wished It to go. It was a great
triumph for Monterey: Â¦ â¢ '
â¢ Kincaid of San Joaauin shone like a
chameleon in the tangle, for j.c changed
his voting complexion several times 'an-3
mine, but If the people of Paris were led
to believe that all California was like the
Paris headquarters, it is probable the
French- colony out here will receive new
members. Â¦ . t
It was some time, at least a day, be
fore the. committee got its calcium to work
properly. The members were not good on
cross-examination and they let a great
deal slip that they might have nailed, and
they went on false trails without number
and with the cheerful energy of a houjid
after an, anise seed bag. .The scent waa
hot enough but there were no . results
Stewart was particularly good at this
sport. .
Melick has been the greatest ' sufferer, '
for, being a newspaper man, he cannot
help asking questions, and his questions
go more toward the news than the evi
dence. He was roasted by Foote the first
day, and unnecessarily so, for the com
mittee tempted baiting by meekly sitting
by and waiting for it to come. There ha-;
never been a man at the bar who has so
liked to badger and bully and rattle a
witness as Foote, and to be the "badgee"
was something new to him. When he
found the committee would take no more
of it he wisely stayed away. .
The committee to investigate the Sap

but little comment up. here, as its work
must necessarily be done In the city, it
is considered a good committee and one
that will bring in a report in accordance
with what facts it finds. â¢

to its "passage, and his amendments to

getting the same kind of. discipline in tho

the Speaker's gavel raps sharply and the
"Assemblymen out of their seats are or

once to being so pointedly ordered home
when other and more favored Assembly
men were allowed to forage for votes, but
it only brought on "words" between him
and the Speaker after the session, and the
trouble was aggravated.
The bill transferring the $48,600 from the
Governor's mansion fund to the .funds of
the State University has been withdrawn
after a fight by tho Sacramento delega
tion. Sacramento has more need for the
mansion than for the State University.
With a $50,000 mansion as well as a Capi
tol, it will be doubly hard to move the
seat of State government from the city
by the muddy river.

State Board of Education Sub-Com
mittee in Favor of This
Plan.
CALIi HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-
MENTO, Feb. 3 âThere was a meeting to
day of- the sub-committee appointed by
the State Board of Education at Its meet
ing yesterday to consider the draft of a
bill providing a Text Book Commission.
At yesterday's gathering It was tacitly
agreed that the Text Book Commission
Bhould consist of one Commissioner, who
would act with the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction and the State Print
er, to form, a commission of three. When
the sub-committee came to consider the
bill further this morning it was decided
that the State Superintendent had already
so many duties that to include those of a
Text Book Commissioner would be to over
burden the office wit?; work, so it was
suggested that there be but one Text
Book Commissioner, he to work under the
supervision of the State Board of Educa
tion and at Its direction.
The bill which the sub-committee de
cided to recommend to the board as a sub
stitute for the one favorably considered
yesterday will provide for one Text Book
Commissioner, at a salary of $3000 a year,
who will be allowed a clerk and stenogra
pher at a salary of tlOO a month whenever
necessary. The reason for the change was
to have in the hands of the State board
control and direction of the selection of
all copyrighted text book matter. It will
be the duty of the Commissioner to dis
cover and to recommend valuable matter
to the board, which will then direct Its
purchase if it be deemed advisable.
â¢ There will be another- meeting of the
State Board of Education to-morrow, at
which the new bill will be considered.
The sub-committee which met to-day
was composed of State Superintendent
Kirk, Professor Daly, president of the San
Jose Normal School, and Professor Black,
president of the San Diego Normal School.

From the waters lying between Whidby
Island and the mainland they attempted
to pass out to the; opeu Strafts of l-"ue;\

iÂ».t this season in thvi lull &wÂ«ep of the
winter tides a recular maelstrom. '
About midway in tlie pass the boat was
caught by a whirlpool and swept up
against one of the many little rock isl
ands. Lewis and Mitchell scrambled
out upon the rocks and while looking for
a. place where the boat rnicht b.<5 safeiv
moored a twist of waters swept the paint
er Â£rom their grasp and the boat went
whirling down ihe pass toward the straits.
The shores en both sides of the pass arc
precipitous.
There are very few houses along- them
and none within sight of the rock UDon
which the men were marooned. Steamers
avoid the pass during: the winter season.
The situation seemed desperate. There
was no fresh water on the rock and

"Just as I was preparing to leave the

VALLEJO. Feb. 3.â "Walter Clark, a
young man about 23 years of age, was
found dead near South Vallejo this morn
ing. He had succumbed to the effects
of a charge of shot that had entered his
race, head and chest. Â¦ Garneid . Hansen,
a half-witted foreigner, who lives on a
scow near the place where Clark's body'
was found, is held In prison here to
answer for murder.
Early this morning Clark, -who. It Is
said, had been drinking heavily, tried to
gain entrance to the Ross house In South
Vallejo, but was persuaded by Its in
mates to move alonj?. Shortly afterward
persons heard the report oi a shotgun
near by, but took no notice of It until this
morning, when the body of Clark was
found near the- railroad track, which runs
directly In front of the Ross place. Â¦
All evidence points to Ilansen as the
murderer. Chief of. Police Stanford says
the shot was flred from the door of Han
sen's scow and" with Hansen's gun, an
eld musket, which evidently had been
heavily charged. All that remains,- the
Chief says. Is to get proof that Hansen
was the man who pulled the trigger.
Stanford does not believe this will be
hard to do. Hansen is known to have an
uncontrollable temper and was easUy
â¢wrought up to a frenzied state.
Clark has several brothers and sisters,
who reside here, and it Is believed he
was on his way home when he was ahot.

FIGHTING HARD
FOR THE SUBSIDY
Strenuous Efforts to Be Made
to Force the Bill to
a Vote.
WASHINGTON. Feb. S.-Congressman
Shafroth of the Committee on Coinage.
Weights and Measures has prepared the
minority report upon the bill directing the
Secretary of the Treasury to exchange
Brold for legal tender silver dollars when
presented to the treasury, and will file the
same to-morrow". The minority report
sa ys : â¢
We object to the passage of this measure: â¢
1. Because It will impose increased burdens
upon the gold reserve or the Treasury. To say
that it will not Is to deny the recognized prin
ciple of supply and demand. To add the
EOO.OOO.OCO of silver dollars which r.ow act as
redemption money for the" silver certificates,
mid are not a charge upon the gold reserve,
to the moneys which are redeemable in gold
must creatly Increase the burdens upon the
Treasury reserve. It cannot be safe for a
nation to increase its cold obligations with
out increasing Its reserve.
2. Because It will create a new endless chain
upon the gold reserve of the Treasury. Th->
policy of the Government heretofore has been
to diminish the obligations redeemable In gold
and thereby prevent runs upon the Treasury.
The gold standard advocates have unanimously
contended that the greenbacks should be re
tired, so as to relieve the Government of -the
necessity and cost of maintaining a gold . re
serve. They contended that the Government
should go out of the banking business. This
measure Is a reversal of that policy. It- creates
new obligations upon the reserve; It plunges
the Government deeper Into the banking busi
ness.
3. Because it facilitates the exportation of
gold. By making the principal medium oC ex
change used by the people redeemable In gold,
it becomes much easier for the exporter of
cold to cather up' obligations payable in that
metal and present them to the Treasury for
exchange. No other nation on earth facili
tates the export of gold. The scramble of the
European nations at the present time for gold
should demonstrate the necessity for legisla
tion discouraging instead of encouraging the
exportation ot that metal.
. 4. Because it will produce the destruction
of silver dollars and â¢ sliver certificates as
money. When silver dollars are made, pay
able In gold, they become simply promises to
pay. . What government would maintain prom
isee to pay stamped upon as ilAir material us
silver, when they could be printed upon paper
at no appreciable cost? Would It not be foolish
for. the nation to keep Invested in promises to
pay ?250, 000,000 (the bullion value of her silver
dollars) when she could print them upon paper
and save that amount ? Nearly , every witness
that testified before the committee admitted
that the measure would ultimately produce a
retirement- of the silver dollars and a eaJe of
the same nÂ« bullion. â¢ This Is a new policy in
the treatment of the precious metals. No na
tion on the face df the globe discredits Us sil
ver, coins by. making them simply promises to
pay. No government redeems Its silver - In
(Old. Why should this nation, which produces
one-third of all the silver of the world, be
the very first to strike down one of Its own
Important Industries? " â¢
: 6. Because it will depress the prices of all
commodities and property. This measure will
make gold do all the work of basic money
now done by both gold and silver. â¢ We cannot
thus Increase the burdens : upon gold without
Increasing the demand for â¢Â¦ the same. The
increase In the world's production of gold Is
not J sufficient to dlspla.ee the silver stocks, in
existence. Statistics show that more than 50
per. cent of the gold product is used.' In the
arts or lost to commerce, .which leaves only
about I150.OQO.000 Â¦ a year to supply the needs
of all Christendom. . That Is less than 3 per
cent of the gold stocks of the world and lc
no more than the : legitimate requirements of
an Â¦ Increasing , commerce.
6. It Is Impossible ' for . silver dollars to go
to a discount- so long as they are. limited In
number, as now : provided by law,- and hence
there Is no â¢ necessity for this legislation. As
It is Impossible for silver dollars as now lim
ited by law to depredate In value why should
we ; run the hazards of making Increased bur
dena upon the gold reserve, of creating a new
endless â¢ chain upon the treasury, of facilitat
ing â¢ exports of gold â¢ or of . annihilating sliver
and * silver certificates as money and of pro
ducing an era of falling prices?

Schorr's Plan to Keep Secret the Form
of His Two-Year-Olds.
"Speaking of two-year-olds." remarked \
an old-time racing man who had Just re- j
turned from a trip to New Orleans, "It is
a well-known fact that one of the hardest
things connected with the management of
a large stable Is to keep the form of your
two-year-olds a secret. Between the news
papers, rallblrds and stablehands many a
good thing" is queered, and onlv a short
price can be had by the owner because
the Information has leaKed out that So
and-so has a two-year-old that is going
great suns in private. The result is that
everybody is waiting for that horse to
run. and there is a wild plunge, that sends
to the uost a horse who ha3 never raced
before at even money or worse, whereas
it otherwise might have been a 50-to-l
shot. " j
"Many schemes have been tried to pre
vent this and proven failures, but at New
Orleans Â«I heard of a wrinkle that old John
Schorr is now working that looks to be
about hie only way to beat the crowd that
gets all the early news about the good
two-year-olds. Schorr has fifteen or six
teen yearlings that give promise to turn
out well. Now. Instead of naming these
youngestcrs the foxey old man has num
bered them. That Is, he has really select
ed a name for each horse, but the name
Is onlv known to himself and his son. The
name'of the horse will not be known until
he is entered in a race. This will hot give
the stablehands a chance to tell how such
and such a colt or filly is out to win, and
thus affect the betting. For instance. No.
6 is brought out for a fast trial. That Is
the only way that the men about the
stablo know the horse. If he should do a
really fast trial, why. the men can tell
their friends that No. 6 Is a wonder. But
under what name will No. G run? That Is
just where old man Schorr's new scheme
is going to work well.
Of course. In due time the. names of
the various horses will have to be entered
with the Jockey club, but this will be de
layed until. the last moment, according to
Schorr's plan, and that will not give any
one a cnance to become familiar with the
best horses of the lot." â New York Sun.
Colonel Daggett, in Command of the Fourteenth Infantry,
Says No Braver Deed Was Enacted in Modern Warfare
Than the Scaling of the Rampart in the Face of Death
/ f e^ OLONEL A. S. DAGGETT, com
// mander of {he Fourteenth In
llj fantry, arrived here yesterday on
x^!^ the transport Warren on a short
leave of absence. His .regiment
has the distinction of being the first to
scale the walls of Peking and his regi
mental flags were the first colors planted
on the "Walled City."
Colonel Daggett is enthusiastic over the
brave acts of his men and stated yester
day that no deed in modern warfare could
excel for courage that of his men as t&ey
scaled the walls, watched with astonish
ment by the Russian troops, who were
dum b with amazement. Â«
"We arrived about five miles from.Pe
king- on August 13," said Colonel Daggett.
We camped that night and on the fol
lowing morning were up at sunrise and on
our way to 'ihe Walled City.' About a
third of a mile from the walls a halt was
made and the disposition of the troops
a i!7 aneed for the at *a<*. The fire at
this point became severe from two sec
tions of the wall. Two companies of my
regiment were ordered to advance to a
bastion that projected from the wall and
they gained the point safely by scatter

a time, under a heavy tire

Iiciate. The choir of St. George's' Chapel
Royal, Sir Waller P^rratt directing, will
render the music. The choir will meet the
procession lit the steps of the chapel and.
â¢\uith the clergy, will precede the coflin, the
royal personages, with the servants and
ihe lite Queen's pipers, following.
A memorial service was held this morn
ing in St. George's Chapel, attended by
Kins Edward, Queen Alexandra, the
Duchess of Cornwall and York, Emperor
Yv iliiam. Crown Prince Frederick William,
the Duke of Connaught, other relatives of
ihÂ«s laie Queen and thirty iiidies and ccn
tlemen of the royal household. The royal

iLe siK-ciai prayers prescribed relating to
the reign of Victoria and the accession of

"Blesstd Jesus. Fount of Mercy," render
ing it with beautiful effect. The Kieht
Her. William Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford,
delivered the funeral discourse, takins: for
his text Proverbs, chapter xvl, twelfth
verseâ "For the throne is established by
righteousness."
The aeed prelate read from a desk in
side the communion rail, and could not be
heixrii except by those sittingwvery near
him. He taid in part:
"All our thoughts to-day are about the
great and gracious personality whom we
naye lost. The .end cf her longr reign
marked an epoch. which' grave rise to gratl
lude,* sorrow and hope; to gracious mem
ories and great anticipations. The years
brought stime .pressure at the helm and
s-onse violence of waves: but never once
CBM there any loss of severance, never an
aJienatipp of the hearts of her people. All
are pleayÂ«d that the r.ew King has deter
mined to call himself after the greatest
Â«it" his ancestors, the pure and clean. He
lias greatly- grown, and all along the lines
Â«jf his policy we now seek a seven-fold
fcTef-sing for the seventh Edward."
The benediction was pronounced by the
i3ii~hop of Â¦ Winchester.

TOPEKA. Feb. 3.â Policeman Luster has
reported to City Marshal Stahl a plot on
the part of the liquor men to tar and
feather Mrs. Nation, the "Joint-smasher."
Luster says that a negro tough whom he
once befriended gave him the tip. Mar
shal Stahl is making an investigation.
The report has fric&tened Mrs. Nation
and her sister crusaders, but they declare
that they will continue the work of de
stroying "murder shops." They met w.t 9
o'clock this morning at Urs. Nation's
room and held a session of prayer, ask-
Inc the Lord to protect them from bodily
barm In the dlscharco of what they
termed their duty to the community.
Mrs. Nation braved the 'storm to-day
and made three temperance speechesâ at
the Wesleyan Methodist Church in the
forenoon, at the Christian Church In tho
afternoon and at the Lowman Hill Metho
dist Church In the evening.
A recruiting oflice for the Topeka brls
ade. Kansas Division Carrie Nation's
Array, has been opened. About 30O "sol
diers" have signed the roll, mostly wo
men. The programme of the defendants
is to march down Kansas avenue at 2
R. m. to-morrow with drums beatlns and
ags flying and hold prayer meetings in
front of every Joint. Mrs. Nation says
It was the intention of the home defend
ers to smash joints to-morrow, but thl3
feature of the crusade may be postr>oneci
for a day *to enable the secret service
agents to Inquire into the story that
armed men are guarding the Joints. Mrs.
Nation says she does not mind a shotgun,
but she does not war.t to lead other *o
znen to their -deaths.
Postmaster Guthrle says Mrs. NatlAa
receives more mail than any bank in To
peka. Many of the letters contain money,
and It is said that Mrs. Nation already
has put aside K00 to help carry on tha
liquor war here.
The- saloon-keepers have made every
preparation for serious war. and leaders
among them declare they will kill any
woman who attempts to destroy thalr sa
loons. .In a number of saloons neg.ro
guards, armed with repeating shotgun*,
have been stationed and they have in
structions to kill any person attempting
to demolish their places. Almost every
saloon has from two to five armed guards
stationed Â¦where they can inflict the great
est damagro on the attacking force.
The saloons have been fortified until
the average Topeka drinking resort more
resembles a siege cave than a saloon.
The temperance revival which has swept
over the city during" the past week ha*
divided the resldentg into two determined
bands, each ready to fight if necessary for
its rights. Reputable citizens have de
clared their intention of lyrchlnsr any sa
loon-keeper who kills Mrs. Nation or any
of her followers. The salnon and anti-sa
loon elements are ready for civil war anr!
the first saloon raid which occurs will
probably precipitate it.

NEW YORK. Feb. 2.â Andrew Carnegie
rpoke in Carnegie Hall this afternoon
upon "The Moral Character of Queen
Victoria."
"One of the important traits," said Mr.
Carnegie, "of Queen Victoria was her lib
eral and generous toleration of all sects.
Queen Victoria kept her court pure. The
chief Jewel in her dower was purity. No
t caudal or loose living was ever tolerated
there."
Mr. Carnegie went on to say her un
varying kindness to every one, especially
to the numblest servants, was one of her
strongest traits. He said she once had a
man servant by the name of John Brown.
He was one of those remarkable men
who would have made his mark In Qny
line of work, and stood very close to tue
Queen. When he died she had the follow
ing 1 inscription put on a tablet above his
grave:
"A tribute of loving, grateful and ever
lasting friendship from his truest, best
and most grateful friend, Victoria."
"if we all treated our servants In that
light," commented Mr. Carnegie, "I think
there would be less to say in regard to
the domesi.e problem in this country,"
After Mr. Carnegie's address Edwin
Markham read a poem upon the Queen.
Mr. .Murk hum's poem follows:
Homage and hush of heart belong to death.
When at the door the dread one entereth.
The courteous departure of the soul
â¢ To seek its high, imperishable coal.
The still withdraw&J of that inward thins.
I That gives the ehapen clay the aureole.
Sends on all hearts the ancient wondering.
And so a stillness falls across the day, -, -> ,
Now that the Queen has pushed aside the
crown.
And. with no heralds telling her renown.
Has gone the august, unattended -way â .
Gone down the way all of earth recedes.
Leaving- behind a fragrance of good deeds,
A wreath of memories forever green.
Above her name, mother and friend and Queen.
Â¦Whatever fortune comes to shape events
She carried - in her heart the good Intent.
And 6ure!y, too. since that far-fragrant hour
"When first the bouphs of Eden broke to flower
Nothing hasfhined more kingly than good deeds.
Lol out of these the- golden heaven proceeds.
The memory of good deeds will ever stay;
A lamp to light us on the darkened way,
A music to the ear on clamoring Btreet,
A cooling well amid the noonday heat.
A scent of green boughs blown through narrow
walls,
A feel of rest when quiet evening falls.
The kindly deed will live in memory
When London in far centuries shall be
As still as Babylon and both a dreamâ
"When London dead shall be eome poet s
theme â
When all her tombs and towers shall be
a-HUbt
Of ghostly arches In the noiseless night
Then as some bard on legends borne along
Shall build her faded glories Into pong.
Some Homer sing her darings and defeats.
Filling with crowds again the grass-grown
streets.
Placing dead kings back of their crumbled
* seats.
There suddenly will sweep into hU rhyme.
Victoria's name, long lavendered by time;
And all the poet heart of him will stir
At some small heart-v/arm chronicles of her,
The obscure whisper of some kindly deed
Of this dead Queen, her quick reply to need;
And lo. his song will brighten and will ehine
As though a star should break along the line.
! Greater than any king with wolfish hordes
That ever climbed the pathway of the swords
"Was this Queen-mother, gracious, gentle, good,
A white flower of Christian womanhood.
Her banners felt the wind of every sea,
And yet ehe held a. wider realm In fee.
The pure high kingdom of the womanly.
Peare to her spirit as the years Increase â
Peace, for her last great passion was for
peace.
O God of nations on the dark of things.
Send down the white fire of the King of -Kings
Until all other rulers shall bÂ« lifted up
To drink with common man the equal cup.
Send wisdom upon nation?, and send down
On kir.KS the deeper meaning of crown.
Come. God of Kings and peoples, breathe on
men
Till love's heroic ages flower again.

The claim Is made 'for South Dakota
that it has for the third consecutive year
produced ' more wealth per- capita than
any other State in the Union, the total
for this year bcirtg $106,500,000. Of this

$12,000,000 from minerals. â¢
" One of the more' notable of these measures is that
recently introduced by Representative' New-lands.-: The
bill provides that all moneys received from the sale
anc disposal of the public lands in the arid ar.d semi
arid region, excepting those set aside for agricul
tural and mining colleges, shall form a special fund
for reclamation works. The Secretary of the Interio'
is authorized to make plans for storage works and to
withdraw from entry the lands which it is proposeu
tc irrigate; from them, and he "Is authorized to enter
irto contracts for . the construction of such storage,
works, payable out. of the arid land reclamation fund.
Upon the completion of each, irrigation project the
total cost thereof is to be ascertained and divided pro
nita per acr.e of the lands to be irrigated, and such
amount shall be a charge against the lands as- the
ccst of the water right. .. \ .
Â¦-â¢It is further provided that the lands are to be sub
ject to homestead entry, each entry \ to be limited to
eighty acres, and the' water right is" to" be paid for in
onnual payments extending â¢ over ten years. AH
moneys' received from the sale of water rights are tj
go into the reclamation fund. In all construction work
eight hours shall constitute a day's work, and none
b.it citizen labor shall be employed.
A*n important feature of the measure is that it meets
the objection made by Eastern Congressmen. that the
reclamation 6f the arid lands by the \ Government
would be in effect to tax the 'East for the benefit of
ti.t West. ' The objection is not valid.. for the lands
after redemptionwould be available for Eastern home
setkers as well as for Western men, and the up
building of that great 'region would benefit all sec
tions of the Union. Nevertheless, since the objection
is made it is just as well, to meet it. By the New
lands scheme the fund -for the redemption of the arid
lards is to' be obtained from the sale* of Western
lands. Perhaps. that, will lead Eastern men to look
upon the great enterprise with more favor, and if that
be so a .beginning. of the work may ' be made much
sooner than is now expected.
BY steady if slow degrees the great problem ot"
redeeming the arid lands of the Nation is mak
ing its way to the front as an issue of practical
politics. That much is made evident from the number
of bills dealing with the subject which have been pre
sented at this session of Congress. In their terms
they vary from measures which go no further than to
provide for experiments with irrigation 'in compara
tively small districts to comprehensive schemes for
redeeming the whole arid region. ~ Â¦

will shortly place an order in France for
eight cruisers of 12,000 tÂ«r.s, four armored
cruisers of $000 tons, and one hundred tor

Seventy-three accidents due to water
tube boilers have occurred in the French
navy since 1S90, of. which forty-eight were
due to rupture of tubes, particularized
as follows: Seventeen in bottom row; six
to second. and third row; six to the top
row. and eighteen to intermediate rows.
Thirteen were caused by low water level,
six were due to bad circulation, six were
worn-out tubes and six tubes were of de
fective manufacture.

Seven vessels of the Gazelle type of
third-class cruisers are now afloat in the
German navy. They are named: Gazelle.
Nymphe. Chetis, Xiobe, Ariadne, Ama
zono and Medusa, the Isist having been re
cently launched. at Bremen. The Gazelle
is 2C50 tens and with 6000 horsepotrsr at
tained a speed of 19.5 knots. The others
are 2G00 tqns, S000 horsepower and 21.5
knots, but a recent trial of the Nymphe
surprised the designers in that she dcvel
.oped 9000 horsepower and a speed of 22.3

A new classification of United States
naval vessels is being considered in. Con
gress. It is proposed to include as first
rate all vessels over SOOO tons; second rate,
from 4000 to Â£000 tons; third rate, 1000 to
4000 I tons, as well as auxiliary cruisers
over 4000 tons. The fourth rate will in
clude vessels under 1000 tons. The present
rating Is vessels over 5000 tons as first
rate; 3000 to 5000 tons as second rate; third
rate, 1000 to 3000, and fourth rate, those
under 1000 tons. An arbitrary distinction,
however, in made as to converted cruisers,
the Buffalo of 6888 tons -being a second
rate, while the Yankee and Prairie of 68SS
and 6S72 tons respectively are third rate.

The alleged mutiny on board the British
battleship Barfleur on the China station
was greatly exaggerated. Five gun sights
were thrown overboard, and only six men
were implicated. One man' turned Queen's
evidence and two were discharged, leaving
three to be tried. The cause of the
trouble was the restriction of shore lib
erty, and the crew, have gained their point
in that j they have been granted: shore
leave. One unpleasant phase of the scan
dal is that a gunnery lieutenant has been
held to be tried- by court-martial on the
charge of Inciting to mutiny, which indi
cates tyrannical oppression on the part of
at least one commissioned officer.

Two French submarine boats underwent
a trial, on January 9 last at Cherbourg,
and both boats were found to be in
thorough working; order. M. Lanessau,
the Minister of Marine, made a submarine
excursion in tho Narval, and General
Andre, Minister 'â¢ of War, went in the
Morse. Tho two beats act somewhat dif
ferently when submerged, the Narval
rolling and plunging, while the Morse Is
steady. The submarine steering of the
latter is effected by an apparatus called
the "periscope," consisting of a tube ris
ing twenty feet above the hull, with mir
rors- reflecting the horizon. Into the inte

the Morse lies in the fact that the motive

remedied.

MISS FLORENCE GREENB
BAUM, WHO WILL SOON RE
TURN FROM EUROPE.
Photo by Thors.
That he accomplished all that the responsibilities
of the time and the office called for, is a high proof
of the essential greatness of his intellect, but a higher,
proof is found in the fact that after a century of ex
perience nation has had no occasion to dissent
from his general judgment, but many occasions to
rejoice that the foundations of constitutional law were
so wisely laid. It has been said that his epitaph cou|Â«i
be written in a single line, "Here lies the interpreter of
the Constitution." Such a man well merits the high
est honors his countrymen can bestow upon his mem
ory, and the celebration of the centennial to-day
should be widely observed.
The importance of his service at that critical period
of national development has long been recognized by ;
the bench and the bar. It has been"said by Judge Story ,;
who for many years served with him in the Supreme
Court: ''The Constitution, since its adoption, owes
more to him than to any other single mind for its
true interpretation r.nd ' vindication." From that
opinion hardly any lawyer of learning will be found tri
dissent; and it is an indisputable proposition that the
judge who gave vigor to the Constitution gave vigor
also to the nation that developed from the Constitu-"
tion.
For anything like a proper appreciation of, Mar
shall's work it is necessary to bear in mind that he
had no precedents to guide him in his decisions.
Never had there been s court vested with such powers
as the Supreme Court of the United States, and
before his accession to the Chief Justiceship very few
constitutional questions had come before it for de
cision. Hehad to draw from the great principles of
law conclusions applicable to each case as it arose,
and furthermore he had to apply those principles with
such wisdom and justice that they would be accepted
by the whole body of his fellow citizens as final judg
ment upon the issues involved.
BY arrangements that have been long in prepara
tion there will be celebrated throughout, the
United States to-day the centennial of the acces
sion, of John Marshall to the office of Chief Justice
of the United States. The celebration will be mainly
in the hands. of the bench and the bar, but in many
localities the public schools will take part in it and
the occasion will be employed in impressing upon the
minds 'of tlie pupils" the-gceatness of Marshall's char
acter and vast importance of his.service to the nation.
-'The.man was well worthy gl the honor that is to be
bestowed upon his .memory.- Ht^may not have been
the mostvleafhed'of ; lawyers 'or -the justest ; of < judges

Â¦ When he .took his seat "upon the bench' it was still
doubtful if the Union would live. It was a debated
subject; whether I- the Constitution created a nation or
was : but: -a â¢ federal'/ compact â¢Â¦",' among - independent
States. â¢The organic law, although so wisely framed,
was comparatively without: life. It was a question
whether it had vitality, enough to grow' with, the
growth of t"he. country; and suffice for every/emer
gency; . â¢ '"Â¦ Â¦ ' Yy;\ ; 'Â¦ i ','â¢:'
The issue was of prime importance, and it is.in the
highest 'degree fortunate that the interpretation of tha
Constitution at, that juncture, was intrusted to a man of
the truest patriotism arid broadest capacity. It is not
too much to say that the. preservation of the Union
was d.ue as much to JohhMarshalland his court as to'
Abraham Lincoln' and his ; ,army. Any, weakness on
the part of the Chief Justice, at that early stage of the!
Union would undoubtedly have given the doctrine 'of
State sovereignty a position in the precedents of the
nation that would have prevented the federal union
from ever becoming a national union. What, was
accomplished during the Civil War "was hardly more
than the enforcement of the decisions of the great
Chief Justice. â¢ ;

However, the real secret of Marie's

TIME F^R ACTION.'
WITH the" consummation of the plans by which
the Southern Pacific and . the Union Pacific
railway systems-have been" merged under the
control of a single executive, an opportunity has come
for the beginning of a new era in our commercial and
industrial interests. It is an opportunity not to be
ignored nor neglected. Progressive men in every
part of the State should be alert and prompt to take
advantage of it. Trie time has come for our mer
chants, manufacturers and producers to speak out;
to make known to the new managers of the road the
,full extent of the busuness interests of the State and
the means by which they can be advanced.
The combination in itself is not inimical to us. 'Â¦ On
the contrary it is distinctly promising of good. Under
the old system of railroading California has-been
isolated not only geographically but commercially:
Bad as was our geographical situation.'.' with ..respect
to markets, it was made worse by a, system oi railroad
ing that extorted from this State all: the .traffic- would
bear, for the purpose of supporting' all' manner of
schemes from corrupting Supervisors' in San Fra\i :
cisco to building a shipyard at Newport News. ' In
deed at one time when the people, of.. California were
asking in vain for a speedy closing of the ; .gap in the
coast railway line, it was learned that the president of
the Southern Pacific was subscribing" money -for- the
construction of a railway in South Africa.
In times past every "railway -fight''-, .caused by.
competition among the great trunk lines between
the West and the East brought about, an increased
burden upon us. In this State the Southern Pacific
had no competition, and what it had to lose in strug
gling for traffic elsewhere it made up by extortion
here. By reason of that fact transportation rates were
uncertain quantities. Discriminations of all kinds
were practiced; and to such an extent were they car
ried., and with such an : autocratic power were they
exercised, that even the strongest firms in the State
hardly dared to complain lest the railroad should put
them on the blacklist and injure their business.
The new combination changes all that. So far as
transportation is concerned we are no longer isolated.
Our city and our State have now hecome a part of
the genera! field of a railway system that embraces the
whole country. San Francisco has been united with
St. Louis, Chicago and New York. It is no longer
an outside point. It has become a- part of the great
ring. As the commerce of the Pacific Ocean ap
proaches in bulk and in value that of the Atlantic, San
Francisco will approach the importance of New York;
and the transportation lines across the continent, hav
ing'an equal interest in both points, will have no
inclination to be adverse to our prosperity.
Such is the promise of the situation. It is there
fore important that at this juncture there be an early
presentation of the case of California and San Fran
cisco to the manager? of the new system. They
should be informed' of the evils imposed by the old
system, of the unjust discriminations against us, of
the extortion practiced upon us, of the corrupting in
fluence of Southern Pacific politicians, of the handicap
put upon producers, manufacturers and mexchanls
by the adverse freight rates imposed. , They should
also be informed of what is needed in the way of
reform. The abounding -resources and industrial- and
commercial advantages of the State should be made
known to them, so that they may understand how
much of profit will come to themselves by increased
traffic should they change the policy of the old com
pany and treat the State and the city with fairness.
To that end the business ;rnen of the State should
speak out. - There if nothing to be gained at this time
by hesitation or by following the promptings of fear.
That would be but a coward policy: and in junctures
like. this fortune favors the brave. Let us have in this
issue co-operation in all parts of the State. The time
has come to act.
TRADE QUIET flND FEATURELESS
THERE has been no marked change in trade for
some weeks, beyond the pronounced gain iri
bank clearings previously noted. There is still
a large and steady movement of merchandise into
consumption, without any especial activity in any par
ticular line. Last week was the same as its predeces
sors for some time. The bank clearings gained 33.7
per cent over the same week last year, and with tb*
exception of Philadelphia, which lost 3 per cent, a!l
:he leading cities in the country showed an increase
in trade over 1900. The failures were against 171 ,
in 1900. There was more or less activity in Wall
street, aside from the flurry in Southern Pacific and
Union Pacific stock caused by the great railroad deal,
as money has been flowing liberally into New York
from the ir.terio-r and the street confidently expects
2n easy money market for some time to come Ster
ling exchange has risen to the gold exporting point
Â£.nd more or less gold will now probably flow from
this country to England to replenish the depleted re
serves of the Bank of England. One shipment of
$2,300,000 was made to Paris during the week. These
prospective gold shipments are viewed with 'equa
nimity by financiers, as it is felt that we can spare a
certain amount of gold for European shipment, and
it will he!p our own markets by easing the English
situation.
The leading staples show little change. Sales *of
wool at the three chief markets suddenly, ran up . to
5.4U.000 pounds, against 2.893,400 during the same
week last year, but this increased business was as
cribed to necessary replenishment of stocks after a
leng period of dullness, and was only effected by con
cessions on the part of sellers. Woolen goods have
been cut 10 and 20 per cent, and the cut is said to'bt
permanent. There is r.o marked variation in cotton
goods. Wheat has lagged as usual, but the weekly
clearances for foreign export were larger than for
the same week last year. Boots and shoes and cloth
ing are reported more active from retail hands, owing
to cold and stormy weather, but manufacturers and
wholesalers do not report any especial improvement.
The other staples stand ab'^t the same as before.
The local situation runs along from week to week
without much perceptible change. As between mer
chandise and produce the former seems to "be having
the. best of it this winter. Merchandise dealers all

brisk demand for export, as well as for local custom,

leÂ«s. Grains of all kinds are Â«quict, and dried fruits
and raisins are neglected, as usual at this time of the
year. The Government is buying large quantities of
beans for the Orient, which keeps prices for this prod
uct high and stiff. The cattle and sheep markets for
slaughtering recount Lave declined a little during the
past few days, as the extreme high quotations have
cut down the household demand for meats materially.

OUR INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS..
ONLY a short time ago The Call had occasion
to direct attention to statements made in Parii
and in Vienna concerning the alarm felt in
France and Austria ever the increasing force of
American competition with the industries of Europe.
Since then Consul Mason at Berlin has forwarded ro
the State Department an article in one of the leading
papers of Germany 'repeating the S3me cry of danger
tc Europe and pointing out how the competition
should be met. The German writer does not favor
ifohibitive, tariffs on American goods nor govern
mental action of any kind that would lead to retalia
tion. His plan is safer and wiser. He would have
the German people study American methods, profit
by them and, if possible, excel them.
After reviewing the rapid growth in the amount
of our exports of manufactured goofls the writer says
all who are familiar with the facts "will agree that tlu
threatened danger from America is neither exagger
ated nor painted too darkly, but is, in fact, real and
serious. But the mere recognition of the peril avails
nothing; what is demanded is to face it, to overcome
it, or at least to minimize as far as possible its effects.
We must ask^ourselves whether this is still possible,
and if so what are the means, the methods, that must
be employed to secure a successful result."
".Proceeding to the task of answering the question
the writer adds: "We must fight Americanism with
its own methods; the battle must be fought with the'.r
weapons, and wherever possible their weapons must
be bettered and improved by us. Or, to speak with
other and more practical words, Germanyâ Europe
inu'st adopt" improved methods in every department of
industry, must use more and more effective machinery.
Manufacturers as well as merchants must' go to<Amer
ica, and send thither their assistants and working
men, not merely to superficially observe the methods
there employed, but r.o study them thoroughly, to
adopt them, and wherever possible to improve upon
them, just as the Americans have done and are still
If will be seen the writer attributes our success in
the industrial world mainly to our machinery
and our- skill and energy ' in using it. A some
what different view was taken recently by
Lcrd Rosebery in on address before the Wol
vtrhampton Chamber of Commerce. He, in
discussing what he, called the "great commercial
warfare waged against Great Britain," said: "The
A mcricans, with their vast and almost incalculable re
sources, their acutenessand enterprise, and their huge
population, together with their modern plan of co
operative syndicates or. trusts for the purpose of
carrying on this great commercial warfare, are per
haps the most formidable. On the other hand, the
Germans, with their calculating and conquering spirit.
rrd the energy with which they seize and use the best
and most economical methods, are but little less, re
doubtable than the Americans."
From these statements we can estimate something,
of the fear which has been aroused in Europe by our'
industrial* invasion. Of course powerful peoples' liki
those of Great Britain and Germany are not-going to
'surrender their markets without a prolonged struggle,
and' we are not to, have an easy conquest despite our
immense advantage in the way ."of natural- resources of

secretary to Right Rev. Bishop Starkey,
pastor of Trinity Episcopal Church Mis

the First New Jersey RÂ«glment. was snot
and seriouslv wounded by Thomas B.
Barker in Arlington this morning.
The shooting, it is said, was the result
of a disclosure made by Barker's wife, al
though Keller denle3 the accusation made
against him. Barker, after the shooting,
surrendered to the police and was locked
up. â¢
According to a story told by Barker to
several friends after the shooting, his
wife last night told him that the illness
from which she had suffered for nearly a
year was due to an assault committed on
her at her home, by .'Rev. Mr, Keller. .
The assault, it is aueged, was commit

ones to help this out. The artist ridicules
the attitude of the public toward ! his

"Hut in this not a wrong standpoint?
Is there r.o art for the multitude? Is It
all in the clouds? No art is as closely
interwoven and as necessary to oar
power of self-expression as is speech or
writing.
"You cannot, however, expect from an
uneducated person an appreciation of an

any other faculty, and In San Francisco
a (Treat deal is being don*? toward this end.
"San Francisco is noted amoni? cities for

too much attention is being paid to the
question of art education, and draw! ig
and coloring form an important part of
the curriculum. Some people are inclined
to think that art is only for the ricn.
That is a great mistake. By buying a
picture a man cannot make it his own.
Art is not a purchasable quality. It exists
within us and the millionaire, though he
may have an entire gallery of master
pieces, if he sees more in the frame than
the canvas, has less of the art spirit than
the mechanic who spends a part of his
earnings and leisure in visiting and being
uplifted by an exhibition. '

The cutting, tearing-, burning, piercing, excruciating pains of
sciatica aro among tho most common and painful forms of nerve
irritation. Nerves that are overworked, irritated, weakened and
run- down until their strength is all gone, cry out in protest
against such misuse and neglect. Are the nerves hungry? They
must be fed Irritated nerves must be quieted, weakened nerves
strengthened and tired nerves soothed and tested. Worn-out
nerves must be built up and the vitality of the whole system re-
plenished before permanent relief comes.

one, the vessel coming' by way of the
great circle, and, as Captain Selzer had
dysentry, this did not help matters. 1 The
bitter cold of the northern latitudes
added to his discomforts, and he gradually
sank, until death came to his relief as the
vessel was passing In through the Golden
Gate.
Wants Her Picture Back.
Clarence Selby Kempff, son of Rear
Admiral Kempff , is very anxious to re
j cover a lost "trade dollar." Mr. Kempff
Is a romantic young man, and In the "trade
dollar" he had a secret receptacle made
In which he ensconced, a picture of 'his
lady love. . He had only to press a button
and the picture was revealed.
Last Saturday Kempff was called to San
Rafael to atte.nd a "function." He wanted
to have one more word with his sweet
heart, so he went to the telephone. .Ex
tracting a nickel from his purse he laid
the latter on a convenient ledge, and, the
conversation proving delightful., he forgot
all about his treasure and, racing, to
catch his boat, left his good money behind
him.
The purse contained $11 In good United
States coin, an English penny and the
"trade dollar." -Whoever.- found- it can
keep the good coin and Mr. Kempff will
pay f2 50 additional for the return of the
"trade dollar." , . *
TUB steamship Guatemala, run
ning opposition to the Kosmos
line, arrived from South and Cen
tral American ports yesterday. She
Is the pioneer' vessel In the new
service of the Pacitlc Steam Navigation
Company and the Compania Sud Ameri
cano de Vapores Company to come to this
coast. The new service will be bi-weekly
between Europe and San Francisco, and
all the steamships are to be modern. The
Guatemala is as handsome a craft as
f-ver came into port. She Is only about
two years old. and her cabin accomoda
tions are oqueI to those of an- steamship
on the Pacific Coart. Nearly all her of
ficers are Englishmen, and the vessel was
built In England.
A full cargo Is ready for the Guatemala
to take out. At Valparaiso the Guate
mala's freight and passengers will be
transferred to one of the steamers of the
Spanish line, which will take, them
through the Straits of Magellan to Eng
land, while the Guatemala will return to
fian Francisco. The Kosmos line steamers
make the same trip, but go through to
European i>orts without transferring.

Sacramento Coursing.
SACRAI-IENTO, Feb. 3.â In the coursing
to-day Walsh &. Heenan's~~Gallant won
first money. Nethercott'a '.] St. Anthony
second and Patterson's Our Maggie third.
There' were, twenty-eight-- dogs in the
stake. There was lively bettine. and the
pikers got away with the talent.
LUXOR and Flying Fox. Curtis &
Sons' clever performers, divided
first and second bonors in the blB
12Â»-dog open stake yesterday at
Union Park. The close of
the sixth round found the courses alor.o
in possession of the right to contest for
the final, and with the prizes already won
the running of the deciding course was
waived.
In contrast with the harsh treatment
accorded them on Friday last, when the
opening round of the stake was run off,
form players fared well, a short dozen of
misses being the limit flgainst them, and
those at average odds.
While the work of the contestants made
up a good card of spirt and â¢ resulted in
many Interesting goes, still nothing sen
sational broke the steady, even coursing
and from start to finish the pace was
about the same with little exception.
OK Capitol, as predicted, showed in
good trim and in a .or.g, close race put
Honor Bright out of the stake, though
the talent figured 3 to 1 against his
chances.
Master Lawrence, disregarded -by th.;
wise ones, broke the monotony of the
third round and scored a creditable win.
Sacramento Boy. noted for his persistency
when orce on the game, was his opponent
and took a goo<3 lead. It looked easy
money for those who had played 5 to 2 on
the winner of the John Grace Cup event,
but Master Lawrence joined in and by
quick, snappy work outgeneraled the up
river dog. held on until victory was his
and beat the Boy at his own came.
Fine Fire beat Iowa Boy in the longest
course of the day. Scoring the first ten
points, the Imported liop had about ex
hausted himself. A relief dop Â¦was called
Into play and Iowa Boy after the nag wa?
raised against him with renewed vigor
kept after the game. Many did not notice
the flag- and thought that the Boy was
entitled to the decision, but the assist
ance of the relief had.onded the course.
Sweetness landed at the host ficuro of
the day lÂ»v beatinp Warnath, a 6 to 1 fa
vorite. She Is about due within the
Stockton Couraing.

XEW YORK, Feb. 3. â The announce
ment that Senator Hill is not a candidate
for the Presidential nomination of h : Â»
party in 1904, is made by the Albany cor
respondent cf I^eslie's Weekly In the cur
rent Issue. He says:
I have the highest authority for the state
ment that Senator Hill Is not a candidate la
any sense for thÂ« Presidential nomination aÂ«J
that he is not responsible for the action ot Ula
friends an-1 will In no way encourage tha
continuance of such action. UTiate\ - er Sena
tor Hill's aim may have been ia the past. &3
en^rDssed In his law practice. It has gnnrn
larger and more lucrative each year and his
absorption In professional duties elves him
little time and less Inclination to respond to
the growing call for him to actively assurfce*
the partj's leadership.
This reluctance on the part of Senator Hill
to re-enter public life la not the result of
pique or disappointment. He simply flntfa
greater conVort and enjoyment In the practlco
of his profession and less allurement tn tae
field of politics, which ha3 never beea a source
of profit, and oSten fca3 given him hardly . a
comfortable Â»ups>ort. Like every other man
who reaches middle life. Senator Hill looks
forward to achieving substantial financial In
dependence by maintaining his established and
well settled professional practice. He Is de
votlngt his best enprgiea to that end and there
fore he is not inclined to respond to such calls
as have been made by the Texas Legislature
and by prominent Democratic leaders and
crganizatlbna In the South and West. Those
who have intimate personal relations with
Senator Hill greatly doubt whether ha will
ever consent to lead his party again In a Pres
idential campaign. AVhlle he is averse to
making public expression of Ms feeling tn the
matter, his determination Is not a secret.
Devoted as he has been for so many years
to his party's welfare, his withdrawal from
politics Is regarded ,as Impossible.' He will
continue to be- an influential factor, but this
will not Interfere with a conviction he has
recently expressed to many friends that offlcÂ«
holding Is unsatisfactory and unprofitable.

Phllo Jacoby on behalf of the club presented
Captain F. A. Kuhl.<< to-day with a beautiful
medal for winning a knightship at the last fea-
The winner of the contest is offered a larger
prize by thousands of dollars than the loser.
This will cause them to strike not only skill
ful but hard blows. Tou Fay that your Mayor
and your splendid police {oree will ho on
hand ani see that the law is not violated.
You express confidence In the Integrity and
ability of the Mayor, of the Police Commis
sioners and your policemen. In this feellns I
fully share. But I am confident that the af
fair will be bevoun<l their control, if thoy
<Jo their be?t. The flfrhtersi will be vrry earn
est. The immense multitude of people, Rath
ered from distant States and cities, some of
Ihem. at least, not possessing the highest or
der of citizenship, will be terribly excited.
Pu^n men would brook no interference, they
will have no control over themselves, your
nollce will b* overpowered, and your city "will
be visited with dlssrace. which you will re-
Ifret np Inng as you live. Such fearful risks
must not be taken.
Again, the Saentrerfest Association of Cin
cinnati and the exhibit which it proposes to
give is not such an association and Is not
such a contest as is contemplated by section
â¬?90. Af= I understand, the. contest between
Jeffries and Ruhlin was arranged for by a
lawyer by the name of WItte. before the as
sociation ever had a legal existence. It has no
grymnasium or hall for athletic purposes, no
distinct membprshiri. and none of the para
phernalia of an athletic club. It was organ
ized simply for the purpose of noilging the
law and brin(rlne oft a contest between two
great fighter*. The law cannot and will not
be trifled with in this manner and I earnestly
ask you to look at the law as I have ex
plained it and I think you will conrlude frith
me that you have been misled. As I have al
ready raid to you In a telecram, I am firmly
convinced that this affair, if it comes oft.- will
be a prize-fight.
In my opinion the proviso only covers exer
cises among the members of the club and ex
hibitions in which members only take part.
Even if my Interpretation Is toa strict. It does
not authorize the brinplnjr together of notert
prize-fighters and the offering of a large prize
to the one who prevails over the other.
The proviso upon which- you rely reads as
follows: "Provided, that nothing in the fore
going shall apply to any pugillFmor athletic
club or any exercises therein, if written per
niisflon for the specific purpose shall first have
been obtained from the Sheriff of the county
or If the exercises or exhibition are held with
in the limits of a municipal corporation, of
th* Mayor of such corporation."
to-day, with th? excr-ptlon of thÂ« last
letter that the Governor mailed to the
John C. Roth Packing Company and plh
*r petitioners, and which will be received
to-morrow in time fcr consideration be
fore the afternoon m^vung. This hrtjt let
ter from the Governor to the Roth Pack
ing Company will be turned over to the
Saengerfes-t directors at once, the sarr e
as all other communications from m*
Governor to the petitioners. Thero are
some who believe that when the full text
of the letter that Is expected to-morrow
morning is fully considered there may be
final action taken at once by the Saeneer
fest Club without waiting for the hear
ing on the application for an injunction.
The managers of the went, however, in-
Flst that no final action will be taken un
til the decision of Judge Hollister is an
nounced.
Jeffries and the party at his training
quarter* came into the city tnis evening
and talkt-d matters over with the pro
moters, loiter the champion and his par
ty attended the theater.* Ruhlin and his
associates remained at the Country Club,
which is quite a distance from the citv.
They had more visitors to-day than usual
and" there was much acitation over the
course of the Governor. Jeffries, Ruhlln.
Martin and Childs will continue their
practice work to-morrow as usual and
keep it up until some official declaration
Is made, by the Saengerfest directors.
COLUMBUS. Ohio. Feb. 3.â Governor
Nash to-day made th? first public state
ment of his position with regard to th?
proposed Jeffries-Ruhlin fight at Cincin
nati, and the grounds uoon which his dc
termination to prevent the fight taking
place in Ohio was bas*d. The statement
is contained in a letter prepared and
mailed this afternoon in a reoly to a peti
tion frcm the John C. Koth Packing Com
pany and KW0 other citizens of Cincin
nati, protesting against the interference
with the tight. Governor Xash says tn
his letter that he fears the petitioners
have bet-n misled by erroneous legal aO
vice. He ouotes the law relating to iiriz<?
fighting and boxing contests and pays:
PRIZE=FIGHTER, LAW
AND THE STATE CLASH
Governor Nash Will Do All to Pre
vent the Contest.
CINCINNATI. Feb. 3.-There has been
more anxiety than training at the quar
ters of Jeffries, Ruhlin. Martin and Child*
to-day. It is their custom to do less work
en Sundays than on other days, and this
cave an opportunity for animated dis
cussions among the pugilists, their train
ers, managers and others over the action
ot Governor Nash.
It is now known to all the promoters
that Governor Nash has "not only given
his ultimatum to the Saengt-rfest Athletic
flub and the 1000 petitioners from the
business circles of Cincinnati, but also
instructions to Prosecuting Attorney
HoflTheimer and Sheriff Taylor. The lat
ter "received a long letter from the Gov
trnor after midnight by Immediate deli\ -
t ry messenger, .and it is a very strong
tlocument, in which his Kxcellency directs
Sheriff Taylor to swear in any number
cf deputies and exeri his fullest power
to prevent the Jight, and in the event of
the Sheriff needing assistance the Gov
ernor pledges him the full power of the
?^ tate.
The Prosecuting Attorney and the Sher
iff state that they will not reply to the
Governor until to-morrow, and that they
will then advise him that they will do
thtir duty and keep in communication
with him for any assistance that may be
needed. The official communication of
Governor Nash yesterday was limited to
county ufficers. if he had communication
with any municipal ofneers ot Cincinnati
it has been Â».ept from the public. The
lour Police CoinmisFiontrrs 01 Cincinnati
iire- appointed by the Governor and nor
bj the Mayor, and it is conceded that the
withes of the Governor would be' followed
by this commission in orders to the en
ure police force. At the same time the
relations between Governor Nash and
Mayor Fleischmann are most friendly
iii;a-it is generally conceded that when,
tht latter kept his promise in issuing a
permit for toe fight he did all that he
intended to do in connection with the
event of February 15.
Â¦\\ hile there have been many confer
ences between the members of the Saen
jjiTfest Association and their attorneys
i*nd other promoters of the tight it is an
nounced that there will be no formal
meeting of the Saengerfest Athletic di
rectors and their counselors until to-mor
iow afternoon. It is generally believed
that it will then' be decided to take no
action in the case until the application
Jor an injunction is heard before Judge
Hollister on Tuesday. At that time, it
is understood. Governor Nas.h will be rep
resented here in the courts by Attorney
Oeneral Sheets, and both sides will abide
ty the decision without further appeal
tc the Circuit or the Supreme Court.
Judgp Hoiiister may reserve his decision
lor a day or two, 'so that the Saenger
lest Athletic directors are not likely to
make any official declaration about de
< larin? the fight off or to the contrary
until the middle or the latter part of
xL** wecic.
The bearing of Jeffries and Ruhlin. who
v.cre arrested :i week ago on the charge
<-t training for a prize-fight, has been
pcitponed for one week on account of
the irjunction ca*e before Judge Hollis
ter. All the other litigation has alÂ«o
beea postponed and none of it will ever
be hcar<i of if Judge Hollister grants a
lirrman**nt injunction. In the event of
Judge Holh'ter refusing: the application
for an injunction it is understood that
Attorney <_jâ¬n*ral Sheet*, lor the Gnv
Â»*nor, will co-operate with Prosecuting
Attorney Hoirhoiiner to have the pugi-
K*tic contestants arraigned before fome

The London Stock Exchange
Passe3 Very Quiet Week,
However.
LONDON. 1 Feb. 3.â With Improved pros
pects of gold imports from CJa continent
and the United State3 the ucmand in open
market; here has practically ceased and It
is not .'likely 'that the Bank of England
will much longer maintain a 5 per cent
rate. Indian exchange has fallen to a
point where It falls to attract cold from
the Cape or Australia, and exports from
those countries will therefore corns di
rect to London. The Government Is ex
pected shortly to issue a fresh war loan.
The fall in silv-er is attributed to free
offerings from the United States to an ab
sence of buying and heavy exports. It
forced a reaction on the unduly Inflated
silver market. Low prices, however, are
now attracting buyers from the East.
The Stock Exchange Â¦was closed yester
day and it had a quiet week altogether.
Interest centered in Americans, where,
however, there was considerable fluctua
tion, the professional dealers swaying
prices at their pleasure. Quotations were
rather better for the week. Union Pa
cific shares were largely bought.
BERLIN. Feb. 3.â The weakest snot in
the market were coal shares, which lost
heavily on unfavorable market reports
Friday the Kolnische Zeitung printed a
very pessimistic statement showing thÂ«
growing difficulty the mines have to se.l
their full output. The statement also em
phasized the fact that the trade is taking
the smallest hand-to-mouth quantities, ex
pecting lower prices later. Some grade3
for the Dutch market have already been
sold at three gulden per ton below ths
regular price. The coal Â¦market wa=Â»
further depressed by -the continued de
cline in 'the Iron business, where the pros
pect of improvement no longer exists.
So far as irdn'is concerned, the exact
opposite of improvement confronts th2
dealers, the situation growing worse daily.
Price cutting between the Silesian and
German producers continues. P.\z Iron,
v/hlch hitherto has scarcely been affected,
now shows signs of weakening and the
association has given its establishments
permission to reduce their output. ThÂ»
blowing out of jthe Belgian furnaces la;Â»t
week also made a bad impression here,
and these various factors combined to
uepress iron shares.
The Inclement weather yesterday de

tions that were scheduled to shoot at the

The dead Prince had been ill for several

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 3.
The final meetings of the municipal
campaign will be held during the com
ing week. After that there will be five
weeks of campaigning:, and the Indica
tions are that a hard battle will be fought.
The Democratic city convention will be
held on Tuesday evening at Masonic Hall.
The Democrats will put a complete city
ticket in the fietd. The only three nom
inations that are certain are those of
Warren 15. English for Mayor, David E.
Bortree for City Treasurer and John H.
Cregan for Councilman from the Sixth
Ward.
Warren B. English has been the only
candidate for Mayor that has presented
himself, "and if he chooses to take the
nomination it is his. From present indi
cations Mr. English* has chosen to take it.
There will be a determined fight made
for David Â£. Bortree for Treasurer. Bor
tree has always been a Democrat, though
he has held the office of deputy under Z.
T. Gilpin ever since Mr. Gilpin has been
City Treasurer. When Gilpin was defeat
ed in the Municipal League # for Treas
urer he and_ his friends felt somewhat
Eore, and it has been decided to give Bor
tree the Democratic nomination and then
try and win as against C B. Morgan, the
Republican nominee, and Felton Taylor,
the Municipal League nominee.
John H. Cregan will be given the Dem
ocratic nomination for the Council from
tho ' Sixth Ward, and will cross swords
with Louis Schaffer, the Republican nom
inee, and Ledgett, the Municipal League
nominee.
The Republican City Central Committee
will hold a meeting on Tuesday evening
at Its headquarters, corner of Broadway
and Eleventh street, when the candidates
will be Invited before It. There will be
a general discussion between the com
mitteemen and the candidates as to the
plan of campaign to be pursued. It is
probable that there will be meetings
throughout Oakland, and that a very
active canvass for votes will be under
taken.
It has been decided by the Republican
committee that its headquarters will be
kept open each day from 9 o'clock in the
morning until late at night. There will
be several of the party managers In
charge.
The Committee of Twenty-one wiU hold
a meeting on Monday evening at the
Board of Trade, rooms. An effort was
made last week to hold a meeting of this
committee, but a quorum did- not as
semble. It expects to take some ' steps
toward Indorsing a ticket, and will indorse

Is done.

Thev give an idea of the range of the
author's genius. When we have thought
of him as the rival of Marlowe we find
that here he is the rival of the polite
poets of his dayâ Sidney. Spenser,. Dan
iels, etc. The sonnets are altogether, dif
ferent from anything else he ever wrote
and constitute another evidence of his
"myriad-mindedness." Furthermore they
are Important in making: a chronological
study of his work, for in the opinion of
nearly all scholars they form the link be
tween his comedies and tragedies. From
whatever standpoint we may look at them
they give evidence of the darker side of
life such as we do not tlnd in his early
plays; one gets the tone of the tragedies
here. And, finally.* they are interesting
because many scholars believe with Words
worth that in these poems Shakespeare
for once "unlocked his heart" and entered
the confessional.
I have suggested a much mooted prob
lem among Shakespearean scholars. As
Furnival says. "The great question is. do
the sonnets speak his own heart or. not?"
Recent critics are not agreed on this
roint. Sidney Lpp in his recently pub
lished "Life of Shakespeare" argues with
considerable force that there is nothing
to be gained from the attempt to read the
life of the dramatist into his sonnets:
that they are â¢â¢exercises" that Shakes
peare set himself to because every other
poet of the day wa3 writing sonnets. In.
support of this theory he finds parallel
passages for almost all the sonnets in the
poetry of the 6ay or in that of the Con
tinent. They are "a medley of imitative
studies" and 'produce dramatically the
illusion of a dramatic confession." On the
other hand, Brandes. Furnival and Dow
den, not to- mention others, argue that
Shakespeare Is altogether subjec.tive and
plucks out the heart of his mystery.
Let us look a little more closely at these
two theories, for there is truth in both of
themâ or. rather, the truth is midway be
tween the two. There was a "sonnetteer
lng rage" In England between 1591 and
1597. The fashion had come from France
and Italy and found expression In Sid
ney's "Astroohel and Stella." Sidney's
"Amorettfr." Drayton'a "Idea." etc. To be
a fashionable poet, popular especially
with the noblemen end with the aristo
cratic authors, one must write this kind
of versa. Within six years 1200 sonnets of
the amorous kind appeared In England.
Shakespeare "applied himself with all the
force of his poetic genius whe,n the fash
ion was at Its height." Just as he adopted
the conventions of the chronicle-history
drama -and comedy and the tragedy of
blood so he adopted those of the sonnet.
Many- of the expressions are thoroughly
conventional: whole sonnets are-imitative
of other sonnets; plagiarisms abound. He
wrote, as other men did. of death and
time and love; he. like other poets, prom
ises his beloved an eternity of fame; he
XXVIII.
There are several good reasons why
Shakespeare's sonnets are comparatively:
neglected by students of his plays, impor- ;
tant as they are in making a complete es- |
timate of his work. In the first place a :
sequence of sonnets or short poems, where
one theme Is looked at from many differ- i
ent standpoints; is apt to become monot- i
onous. There . is no narrati-ve to connect
them, no unity of description â only a cer
tain unlty'of thought. One feel3 this dif
ficulty in reading Mrs. Browning's "Son
nets from the Portuguese," or Tennyson's
"In Memoriam." Only after a very care
ful analysis and Ftudy of each detail In
relation to the general structure doe3 the
proper understanding come to one. Inter
pretation iÂ«= needed tor this kind of writ
ing more than for almost any other kind;
an outline such as one finds ia Furnival's
introduction to the Leopold edition of
Shakespeare oi'Dowden's valuable edition
of the sonnets. Some etrort must be made
to understand the relation of part to part.
the circumstances under which they were
written, the ncrsons referred to. etc.
Just here we strike another difficulty â
the obscurity that will 'always be asso
ciated with the persons referred to. Aftev
all that has been written on the subject
we are still In the dark. A3 some German
critic said: "Ignoramus, ignoramibus."
Such obscurity is baifilng to a student.
With these ditricultles removed there re
mains the Indubitable fact that many of
the sonnets are extremely commonplace;
many cf them "sink almost into inanity
beneath the burden of quibbles and con
ceits' and are "impressive displays of ver
bal jugglery." mere are conceits that
rival those In the early plays, and it is
not at all unlikely that some of- the son
r.ets were -written very early in the au
thor's career. There is also a great deal
of artificial sentimentalityâ they are what
Mercs called them, "sugred sonnets."
After all has been said, however, by way
of criticism there are some reasons why
every intelligent student of Shakespeare
should know the sonnets. The first 12G
sonnets are a revelation of the love of
man â¢ for man, "passing ; the love of
woman." Some one amons" the noblemen
of his day laid hold of the heart of the
poet, and these poem3 reveal his sensitive
soul. They form a striking parallel to the
sonnets of Michael Aneelo, the dialogue*
of Plato and the memorial pcems in En
glish literature. The second group (127
152) !s a revelation of some of the darker
phases of - human love. Its passion and
disappointment and trageay. From the
standpoint of style the sonnets "reach
levels of lyric melody and meditative
energy that are hardly to be matched else
where in -poetry."

Whether this woman was Mary Fjtton or
not. there wa=i some woman probably at
Elizabeth's court who had made Shakes
peare have an unhappy time. A woman,
"of stained character and the reverse ot
beautiful, but a strong nature, intellect
ual, a lover of art and possessed of curi
ous magnetic attraction, with her dark
eyes, which Illuminated her pale face,
wronged him." Something like this was
Shakespeare's tragedy. lie was no per
fect man. He had felt the terrible conse
quences of a misplaced affection, and so
in the sonnets we have what corresponds
to some of David's Psalms. There was
much of the Romeo In his make-up, and
he suffered all the spiritual misery that
one of his deep sensitiveness could feel.
That Is, after all. the most significant
thing in these poems. Underneath the
plot suggested, underneath the special
themes treated.- we hear the strains of
undoubted spiritual misery, we feel th?Â«.t
In some such way Shakespeare was made
aware of the burden of the mystery of
all this unintelllsrible world. How did he
pass from the joy of the comedies and
histories to the tragedies underlying hts
Kreat plays? Through some such suffer
ings as are described in the sonnets. Hero
we have what corresponds to similar ex
periences In the lives of Goethe and Car
lyle and many other men who have, pass
ed through the Kverlastlnp No. â¢
While In his tragedies he was to glvs
expression to the awful tragedy of tho
world through Hamlet. Lear, Othello,
etc.. in the sonnets -we have hla own
indictment of the world about him. X
doubt if there is anywhere in so short a
space an expression of the "wrongness"
of the world that surpasses the sixty
sixth sonnet â one of those "superbly final"
things that only Shakespeare could write:
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry;
As, to behold a desert a beg?ar born.
And needy nothing trimmed la Jollity.
And purest faith unhappily forsworn.
And glided honor shamefully misplaced.
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted.
And right perfection wrongfully misplaced.
And strength by Hmplnsr sway disabled.
And art made tonrue-tled by authority. â ./ -
And folly (doctor-like> controlling skill.
And simple trutfi miscalled simplicity.
And captive good attending captain 111;
Tired with all these, from these would. I fe*
gone.
Save that, to die. I leave my lovÂ» alone.
The poet seems to have his mind stirred
with a sense of the decay of all things.
Death is a reality to him. for he speaks
of "friends hid in death's dateless night."
He realizes the victorious march of tima
in sonnets 34 and 35:
O how shall summer's honey breath hold out.
Against the wreckful siege of battering days.
Or -what strong hand can hold his swift foot
â¢ back? : . .
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid T
How much. then, do "we know about
Shakespeare from the sonnets? There is
evidently a reference to the disappoint
ments connected with the stage and the
following of his art. There were times
when he rebelled against the limitations of
his professional and social life. He .chides
fortune for not making better provision
for him "than public means which public
manners breed."
Then comes It that iry name receives a brand.
And almost thence my nature Is subdued
To what it works in. like the dyers hand-
Pity me then and wish I were renewed.
This melancholy with regard to his work:
is seen especially in sonnets 29. 30. 110. -111.
Further, than this the sonnets give evi
dence of a very sensitive heart. He knew
how to love, and he felt the disappoint
ments of friendship and love. He was no
cold-hearted Bacon; his Intellect was sub
ordinated to a very warm heart. We have
here the evidences of the strong devotion
to a young friend. Whether it was thÂ»
Earl of Pembroke or Southampton or not,
only some one "high born, beautiful,
young, clever, accomplished, ardent."
could inspire such affection as is express
ed in the best of the sonnets, some ono
had " been the inspiration cf his muse
some fine young man had been to him the
ideal of beauty and honor, his "better an
gel." Suddenly he felt that hla friend had
wronged him. The world becomes changed
to him. The keynote of his poems is
struck in these lines:
Two loves I have of comfort and despair.
Which like two spirits do su^sest me still;
The better angel is a man. right fair.
The wor3cr spirit a wumtD, colored 111.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my bÂ«tter angel from my sldÂ».
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,

Is nothing cf "the personal in them.

thing els? bt> true? He did aJopt the

alone, we see Shakespeare aa distinct from
his poetical creationâ loving, admi.ing.
longing, yearning, adoring, disappointed,
humiliated, tortured."
The committee, has bctn Informed that
certain of the accuser* of the Police De
partment have boasted that they have
witnesses who will swear to the direct
payment of money to police official.*.
These witnesses, thoy say. they will not
produce unless the roir.mHteo guarantees
them protection. That* guarantee will be
given them and at the same time a for
mal demand will be made for the names
of these important witnesses.
The committee is also going to ask the.
Police Commissioners for a statement
said to have been prepared by n
police official show-in*.' the location
of every gambling and bawdy house \n
the city, also tho names of the owner*
find o'ecupants. Th<Â» statement w- s
prepared. it is said. at the time
the subject of practically licensing
these disreputable places was first
brought up. for . consideration by
the commission. The intention then was
to allow the houses to run openlv, but on
condition that the owners would consent
to being raided once a month and forfeit
their bail in the Police Court. This list.
It is paid, will show that If the plan had
carried the city -would have received $100.
000 annually in this forfeited ball money
from these offenders.*
While the proof' of the many charges
against the department may be forthcom
ing it is the general opinion that nothing
will be found to implicate Chief of Police
Sullivan in the crookedness. If any exists.
The right and power of the committee to
subpena witnesses has been questioned
by some, and the . members have sought
legal advice. They have been advised that
all the power necessary Is vested in them,
and that there is no question as to their
right to subpena and compel the attend
ance of witnesses. The legal right of a
legislative committee to compel the at
tendance of witnesses was passed
upon by the Supreme Court in the Law
rence case. The court decided at that
time that all witnesses subpenaed must
attend the investigation then in progress
before a legislative committee, "and that
the committee had power to act.
The eommitteQmen wish it emphatically
understood that they do not intend med
dling with municipal affairs. There is a
State law against gambling and they in
tend ascertaining if it has been violated
through the crookednf-ss or carelessness
of the Police Department. But should
anything lax in the enforcement of mu
nicipal laws come to their notice whi'e
conducting the investigation they believe
it their duty to brine., the matter to the
attention of the Governor. A reeommen
daion from them -would no doubt receive
immediate attention.
The investigation will be made as thor
cugh'as possible, and those who have been
making charges will bo called upon to sub
stantiate them. After all the proof of the
accusers is before the committee an op
portunity will be afforded the accused to
clear themselves If they can. The matter
of sr-rving subpenas for witnesses will not
be priven into the hands of the police.
Sheriff Lackmann has consented' to place
at the disposal of the committee as many
Deputy Snerlffs as. they require to assist
them. The deputies will not only serve all
necessary papers, but will also act as
baliffs during the progress of the investi
gation.
Thc members cf the committee appoint
ed from the lower house of the' Legisla
ture to investigate the charges of erook
odncss in the j=an Kranclsco Police De
partment will all be in the city tq-night,
and they expect to be able to commence
their work Tuesday. -It is their intention
to probe to the very bottom 6â¬ the scandal
and ascertain if there Is any ground for
the oft-repeated charges of corruption
in police affairs. 'i hey will endeayor
to make arrangements to-day for the use.
of one of the courtrooms in the Hall of
Justice. If they are unable to do so one
of the courtrooms in the' City Hall
may be obtained. President Newha'.l of
the Board of Police Commissioners ten
dered the use of the board's chamber to
the committee. While the offer was ap
preciated the gentlemen decided that they
could not accept it under the circum
stances.
Will Probe to the Bottom the Charges
of Corruption Mad; Against !

Juneau Crrand Jury "Reads -the Riot
" Act" to the Officials at Wash
ington.
TACOMA. Feb. 3.â William M. Eblerof
Juneau .was foreman of . a Grand Jury
which has just made a sensational report
to. Judge Brown at Juneau on the sub
ject of the preservation of Alaska's fish
and game. The jury report states that,
though the Fish Commissioner of Alaska
had specific knowledge of flagrant viola
tions ot the fishing laws, as shpwji by his
official reports, he made no effort, to bring
these violations before Â«the Grand Jury.
The report continues that the Fish Com
missioner and his assistants live as far
away a6 San Diego and Washington City
and spend only a short time each sum
mer In Alaska. The Jury expresses its
bellef-that they have made their position
a sort of summer's outing Job instead of
endeavoring 1 to protect onÂ« of the chief
sources of profit and sustenance of the
people of Alaska. The Secretary of the
Treasury is petitioned to relieve the in
cumbents and appoint resident commis
sioners. â¢ Â¦-'-' Â¦
The jury's report states that for hick
of, enforcement the game laWs relating to
Alaska are a dead letter. Thousands of
deer are killed yearly with the sole. <Jb-
Ject of selling their hides at 40 cents
<-ach, while their carcasses are left for
wild beasts. On one occasion the car
casses of 600 deer were thrown into the
bay at Port Wrangel at one time, the
greater nortlon of them being does and
fawns. Stringent game laws are recom
mended, together with means of enforce
ment.
â¢ The jury recommends the building of
comfortable jails at Wrangel, Juneau
and Douglass City and the erection of an
insane "asylum, that insane persons need
not In future be confined in dirty Jails.

HOTEIi ARRIVALS,
As to all the talk about killing whites, he
said it was never their intention and they
expected only to treat and act with their
own people, and In so doing expected fin
ally to get all whites out. He also said
that the "Great Spirit" would see that
they got justice, even though th'eir white
fathers in Washington and the oil syndi
cates were tryine to rob them of their
once happy hunting grounds.,
When placed Irr prison here, Harjo and
his followers were searched; fumigated,
their shackles removed, and a.i placed' In
one large cell. A newspaper correspond
ent, with the assistance of am interpreter,
had an interview with Crazy Snake, who
said that he saw no reason for arrest and
felt confident when the Indians were given
a trial before, the great white father's
courts that they would be released. He
said they were acting in pood faith and
had papers from Washington that gave
them the right to establish their old gov
ernment.. . _"-â¢ -

wlll be held pending trial for treason. The
Indians were brought here from Henrietta

It is stated that certain attorneys, who
it is asserted here, misled the Indians,
may be- prosecuted. . Marshal Bennett
states that while most of the Indians are
in hiding, some are still trying to Â£old
meetings, .a posse will be "sent to-mblrow

I\'EW YORK, Feb. 3.â Evelyn Baldwin!
the Arctic explorer who next summer. }s
to head the Baldwln-SSiegler expedition* to
the North. Pole, returned to-day on the
steamship New York. Mr. . Baldwin has
been abroad" since December 1, securing
vessel^ and equipment.. He said:
I shall .remain here - for 'several -weeks and
then I expect. to go abroad again. As to many
of the details of the expedition I cannot' ppeak
at present. I have succeeded in purchasing the
EEQiilmaux. the largest whaling vessel 1 could
find. She Is admirably fitted for our work,
hvanigf been built for 'just such work., I. have
renamed her the America. .-..-..
The â¢ America is barkentlne-rlgged, with her
machinery. aft, bo that the stem can have play
In the Ice. In addition to this her. screw Is in
a well, so- that -it can be Ilfed. when the ice
Interferes. - â¢
In addition to Â¦ this vessel I have chartered
the Frltjof, which was used 'lasi year by the
Swedish expedition. The Frit jo J will accom
pany the America with ' supplies and equip
ment. She will Jeave Tromsoe. Norway. June
25, with a party of scientists and sportsmen.
She will sro to Franz Josef land, returning to
the same port in September 1:
The America Is Â¦ two and a half â¢ feet 'thick
and is built of greet hort. fl. hard' tropical
wood. I have my own plan fÂ»r reaching the
pole and I. am confident of success. I never
.had a talk with Captain Joseph C. Hernler.
the explorer, who, according to a cable dis
patch, said that he had warned, me that my
plan would result In failure. I shall go over
the FVanr Josef route, probably starting early
In June. Wo shall proceed north. We have
not limited the time to one .year. â¢
' I cannot tell the personnel of the expedftlon,
but while- many of the crew will not .be
Americans most of those comprising my party
will be from this c<Suntry. â¢ . Â¦ Â¦
As to the report 'that he had cornered
tho Arctic dog market, Mr. Baldwin said:
I got all the sled dogs I need, and that Is all
there Is to that story.. If the price of dogs went
UP I cannot tyelD that.
Mr. Baldwin eald that the America was
now at Dundee, Scotland. While on the
other side ho. purchased' tents., furs , an:]
other equipment. He said that while on
the vessel the men would eat good whole
some food, but that while pushing North
they would have to subsist on condensed
food. He looked over the market -with
a view of supplying the larder. He ex
j nects, however, to twiy almost all of his
j lood supply in this country.
Says That He Has Secured an Admir
able Equipment and Feels Con
fident That He Will - Be - â¢
Successful. ~

Large Congregation Listens to Eu
logy of -Dead Queen* at Bush,
' Street Synagogtie.
There was a large attendance at the
Bush street Synagogue Saturday morn
ing when a memorial sermon in honor of
Queen Victoria was delivered by Rabbi
Myers. Taking for. his text - Proverbs,
xxxi: 30. "A God-fearing woman shall be
praised," Rabbi Myers said in part: . -.
"The brightest gem in Victoria's crown
was .her conscientiousness. She was a
loyoi servant of the King of kings, and
the fear- of the Lord was ever in her
heart.' The 'scepter of her reign was a.
scepter of equity, .and her throne was
based upon righteousness and justice. In
the words of the Psalmists it may be said:
'Thou didst love riphteousness and didst
hate iniquity," therefore tho lxird thy God
anointeth thee jvith. the oil of joy above
thy fellows.' Her gentleness and her
peace-loving disposition, her 6pirit of tol
eration,-. the purity of her life - and the
.faithful discharge of all her duties as' a
constitutional, sovereign, as ' a devoted
wife/mother and friend, and her readiness
at all times to sympathize with suffering
and sorrow, endeared her not only. to all
her subjects, \ but* to all good, men and
women. Â¦.--:, . . Â¦ . ,

Action on the communication was post
poned for two weeks, as the plans for
the celebration have not yet proceeded
far enough to permit of a determination
as to wh'at disposal will be made of the
proceeds of. the entertainment.
A motion was made that the chairman
be empowered to appoint such sub-com
mittees as -he deemed necessary to con
duct the preliminary work of preparing
for the celebration. The objection was
raised that if the sub-committees were
named there would be nothlnja- left for the
executive committee to do and that body
might Just as well go out of existence.
A debate lasting for more than an hour
followed. The motion was carried by a
vote of 60 ayes. to 55 noes. A' recess of
ten minutes was taken, at the end of
which time Chairman O'Gara announced

IRISH-AMERICAN CITIZENS MEET
TO. ARRANGE FOR ST. PAT
RICK'S DAT CELEBRATION.
As the result of a criminal operation
Betiy L. Anderson, SO years old. a denizen
of the tenderloin, died yesterday morning
at the Golden State lodging-house. Eddy
and Mason streets, and her body was re
jnoveu to the Morgue. The case was re
ported to the Coroner and the police by
Dr. Ker.ry Meyers, who was called in a
few minutes before the woman died.
Deputy Coroner Methan and Detective
Oibson were unable to learn the name of
the party responsible for the woman's
death. Mre. Triechel, with whom Miss
.Anderson formerly lived at 224 O'Farrell
IFjTeet, informed the detective and deputy
coroner that Miss Anderson had admitted
to her a few days ago that a woman had
performed an operation upon her. Paul
Barthl, a baker residing at 239 Natoma
street, attended to Miss Anderson's wants
for twelve hours before she died. When
he found that she was in a serious condi
tion he called in Dr. Meyers. An inquest
Â¦will be held to-day. The deceased was a
- native of Sweden and had no relatives la
this country.
X>eath Results Fronx Malpractice.
One of the most exciting Incidents I
en the exciting voyage ot tho Warren ;
was furnished by Dr. Lloyd R. Hawley :
and his wife. The doctor was a. dentist j
In Manila -with a very extensive practice
and when he boarded the transport fir
leen big trunks followed.
The doctor and his wife made many
friends on tiie steamship and for a time
were social favorites. Then an^ry words ;
vere heard coming from their stateroom!
and finally the cumax . come one night J
about' the time the transport was oft i
Honolulu. \: Â¦.'.... !
Suddenly there. was a crash of falling: I
glass, a stateroom door was wrenched 1
open and Dr. Hawley and his wife ap
peared on deck, struggling aesperateiy. I
The docior was doing his best to subdue i
his wife and she van vowing that she i
would throw him overboard. Aft to the j
midship gangway they struggled, and Â¦
there, iosing their balance, tney fell to
the main deck. - j
The disturbance was reported to Quar
tc-rmaster Captain Miles and to Captain !
Krazier. They at once gave the neces- j
eary orders and Or. â¢ Hawiey was locked |
up in one room and Mrs. Hawley In an- |
other. When the transport reached Hon- j
â¢ iluiu they were put ashore, and are still
there awaiting transportation to San
Francisco. Their fifteen trunks are still {
r.board the Warren, however, and will i
be kept by the quartermaster's depart
ment until the owners claim them. Â¦
Employes on the transport assert that j
Mrs. Kawley was troubled with Insomnia I
and took a powerful sleeping draught, j
which reacted and for the time beinsr !
'drove her crazy. However, the Hawley
Incident was the most exciting, while it
lasted, of a very exciting voyage.

TRIES TO THROW
HIM OVERBOARD
The United- States army transport War
ren had the ill luctk to encounter on her
last voyage a series of mishaps such as
rarely foHow a ship from port to port.
Had it not been for the nautical ability
of Captain Frazier and the skill of Chief
Engineer French the steamship might
never have readied San Francisco.
When the Warren leff here the
supposition was 'that she was to" be back
inside of two months. When the trouble
in. China broke out she had to start to
Taku v.ith troops; then she had to brine
men from . the southern islands of. the
Philippines to supply the places of those
sent to China, and after making two round
trips she was ordered home. Instead of
being gone two months she was away five
.months and seventeen days, and the won
der is that she got back at all.
The Warren was formerly the German
steamship Scandia, and was one of the
first purchased by Uncle Sam at the out
break of the Vvar. Other vessels . pur
chased after her have been laid up and
overhauled, but the Warren -kept on her
regular course and made the usual sched
ule time, until this, last trip. The six
months' cruise' was. the last straw, and
now it comes down to a question of ex
tensive repairs. The nremen assert that
ten j minutes after the transport cast
anchor off the quarantine station two. of
the furnaces went down. Two of them
burned out when the transport was in
Manila, and had the latter accident hap
pened at sea tugs might now be out lootc
mg for the Warren.
When the transport was sent to Taku,
China, with the Ninth Cavalry, she had
to anchor about twenty miles from shore,
much to the disgust of the officers and
crew. The transport was in good com
pany, however, as almost every nation
in the world had a warship there. One
day tnere was a mishap over the landing
or tho cavalry, and their horees, find H
was necessary to -send a launch ashore.
A twenty-mile run with a boat of limited
coal capacity is a serious undertaking,
and due preparations were made. It came
to naught, nowever, as the launch broke
down and the men had to take refuge In
a British cruiser. They were well cared
for that night, and next day the engines
were repaired and the launch returned to
the Warren.
All -that the men on the transport saw
of the Chinese war and the "loot" was
through a twenty-milÂ© lens, and, accord
ing to them, the scene was "bum."
Keturniug to Manila, the Warren was
ordered Up San Francisco. Troops had to
be moved, however, and she had to make
two trips. 'among the islands. Captain
Frazier proved his qualities as a navigator
and not an accident occurred. About a
dozen complimentary letters testify to thÂ»
esteem he is held in by the various officers
of the regiments that traveled on the
steamship. "
When the Warren again reached Manila
she was provisioned for an eight months'
cruise, but at the last moment when
steam was. being raised the two furnaces
went down. That meant repairs and the
man in charge at Manila ordered the Ves
sel to San Francisco. Leaving port the
transport, ran into the British steamer Mo
gul and damaged. her considerably. The
stories on the steamship are to the effect
that the signal from the bridge to the
engine-room was "slow astern." Instead
the engines were put "slow ahead'." Had
It been "full "speed" the Mogul would
have been cut in two. .As it was several
of her plates were dented and her "ginger
bread" work demolished.
First assistant Engineer Frank James
was on watch, but Second Assistant En
gineer Gibson- was in charge of the en
gines. James was held to be responsible
by the quartermaster captain and captain
and was- suspended from all duties save
those of machinist.
After getting away from Manila the
Warren had fair weather until she
was off the Hawaiian Islands. Then the
boiler tubes began to give trouble and
steam ' could not be kept up. Captain
Krazler on tho advice of the chief en
gineer headed for Honolulu. There the
vessel was fixed up temporarily, but two
more furnaces went down soon after she
dropped anchor In quarantine. On this
account steam could not be raised in her
'boilers and she had to be taken to her
dock by the tug Slocum.
Among those who came home on the
.Warren was Mrs. McGregor, wife of Ma
jor McGregor. She Is accompanied by her
daughter. On reaching Manila her. hus
band Was at the front where considerable
fighting was going on. Major McGregor,
on learning of his wife's arrival, advised
her to come home, which she did, tak
ing the Warren, tho next vessel to sail for
San 'Francisco. Â¦ â¢
The chances are that the Warren will
be laid, up for several months, and that
the Lawton will take her place " among
the Islands.
