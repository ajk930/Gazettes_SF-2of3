THE FUNERAL PAGEANT
GOVERNOR STANLEY OF KAN
SAS, WHO "WAS WORRIED BY
MRS. NATION. *
Kans., Jan. 2S.â Mrs. ; Car-
I rie Nation to-day invaded the of-
II " flee of "Governor Stanley In his
chambers In the Capitol building
and for a solid hour arraigned the
chief executive of the State for his failure
to close the saloons of Kansas. Then in
turn she visited the offices of Attorney
General Goddard, County Attorney Nich
ols and Sheriff Porter and demanded of
each that they close the saloons. â¢
."When, Mrs. . Nation entered Governor
Stanley's office she was followed by a
crowd of newspaper reporters and others.
By turns she administered to Governor
Stanley a tongue-lashing for his -failure
to uphold. the laws against liquor. selling
or begged him for aid to carry on her
crusade. She put " her questions with
| fierceness and answered them herself
without giving the Governor time- to utter
a complete sentence in his own defense.
Mrs. Nation accused Governor Stanley
of branding her a law-breaker and de
manded to know if he had a better method
than she of ridding the State of saloons.
. "Do you think my method is right?" she
asked.
"No, I don't," replied the Governor.
"Well, Governor, have you a better
one?"
As the Governor turned In his chair to
make answer every one listened intently.
"No, I don't think I have," he finally re
plied.
Continuing, he managed to edge in a
few words more. "What can I do? I am
powerless. The law does not allow me to
do what I desire. The law gives me no
privileges. What can I do?"
V'lf necessary call out the militia," was
Mrs. Nation's prompt reply.
Then this crusader began'a philippic that
caused Governor Stanley's anger to rise
and the crowd grouped about his desk to
look on in wonder.
"You can close every joint in Kansas if
you will. Governor Stanley," she said with
force. "You can do it if you want to, but
you won't. But you are a law-breaker
yourself If you don't. You took your oath
of office to keep the law."
As Mrs. Nation proceeded she became
more vehement and her voice quivered.
She rose from her chair and looked full
in the face of Governor Stanley, and
pointing her linger at him called him
"law breaker" and "perjurer" without the
least show of fear. She repeated these
words of accusation again and again. He
tried to make reply, but she gave him no
chance, | the words of Invective pouring
frpm: her with a. rush . that would not be
stemmed. - ; - â¢â¢ â¢
Finally, his temper gone, Governor
Stanley, arose from his seat and shouted
back: '/..'Â¦
"You cannot come here and talk that
way to me. You cannot talk , to me this
way, I -say. You are a woman; but I
<$von't stand it. You will have to leave if
you cannot."
- "I am a mother. I am a grandmother.
And I represent the mothers of the State."
"You don't, you don't represent them,"
almost shouted the Governor.
The words flew back and forth with such
fierceness that it was impossible to dis
tinguish them. The room was in an up
roar.
Then Mrs. Nation talked more calmly,
pleading with the Governor to aid her.
"You come with me and help smash sa
loons," she urged. And then she added:
"If you won't help us, if you won't help
me, I'll go around and I'll smash, smash,
smash, Governor. The devil seems to
have a cinch on the men, but he hasn't a
cinch on the hatchets and rocks."
Finally Governor Stanley volunteered:
"You get the Prosecuting "Attorneys of
the : different counties Â¦ to put the joint
keepers In Jail, and I'll use my power as
Governor to keep them In. I'll see that
they are not pardoned out." ; ;
This promise Instantly transformed Mrs.
Nation. She fairly beamed with Joy, and
thanking the Governor started for the of-
Demands That the Governor Call Out
the Militia and Invites Him to Join
in Smashing Saloons.

UNIQUE VERDICT OF
A CORONER'S JURY
Agrees Murray Hall Died of Natural
Causes and "He Was a Lady."
ICKW YORK. Jan. 28.â "Murray Hall
came to her death by natural causes. He
was a lady."
This was the verdict returned by a Cor
oner's Jury to-fiay in the inquest Into the
death of Murray Hall, a woman who for
thirty-five years passed as a man, was
prominent In. politics and a member of the
general committee of Tammany Hall. The
case. Coroner Zucca said, was not proper
ly one for Mm to have had. the question
of sex and . rumor of foul play having
caused him to take It up.
In his speech to the Jury, as well as
throughout the entire proceedings, the
Coroner continually mixed his genders In
referring ,to deceased, cften using neuter
as a means of escape.
Miss Minnie Hall, an adopted daughter,
testified that she had lived with Hall flf.
teen years and never suspected he was a
lady.
A note in Hall's handwriting was pro
duced in wjiich he complained that he had
been sandbagged and almost disabled for

LONDON, Jan. 28.â The ceremony of
proclaiming King Edward VII as
King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland and
Emperor of India continues In all
centers of the kingdom. The impressive
function took place in the royal borough
of Windsor at noon. Thousands witnessed,
the historic proceedings. The Mayor read
the proclamation from the baÂ»e of the
Queen's statue on Castle Hill, and the
recorder read it at Henry VII's gate. Fan
fares of trumpets and cheers for his Ma
jesty, in which the Eton boys took' a
prominent part, closed the ceremony.
According to the present arrangements
the United States is the only country
which will not be specially represented at
the funeral of Queen Victoria, The United
States Embassy has received no instruc
tions so far, and it is supposed that only
the United States Embassador, Joseph H.
Choate. and his staff .will be present.^
Practically all business will be suspend
ed Saturday. The stores will not open ex
cept in the poorer Quarter.-
In order to give Londoners a full oppor
tunity to witness the funeral procession
it has been decided to extend the. route,
which is now fixed to pass : Buckingham
Palace, through St. James Park and past
St. James Palace to Piccadilly, then along
Piccadilly to Hyde Park corner, through
Hyue Park, emerging at the 'marble arch,
then along Edgeware road to Paddington
station. This is double the length -_of the
route originally intended, and will con
sume fully two hours. For similar rea
sons the route at Windsor has ' been ex
tended to Include High street, Park street
and Long Walk before entering the 'castle.
It was officially announced late this,
evening that King Edward had ordered
Saturday to be observed as a day of gen
eral mourning. All the banks will be
closed and business suspended. The ar
rangements for the funeral have been only
partially determined. Almost everything
thus far is provisional and subject to the
approval of the King, who will come to
London to-morrow "to look over what has
been proposed and give his decision.
By order of the King the oftlcer^f works
desires that all draperies displayed by
citizens shall be purple.
The procession from the St. George's
Chapel Royal, at Windsor, to Frogmofe
has been abandoned, and the coffin will
remain in the chapel until the day of in
terment,, which will probably be Monday.
Emperor William has commanded Count
von Wagcl, master of horse, to bring six
of his Majesty's chargers from Berlin, and
the Kaiser, the Crown Prince -and other
Germans, in official attendance at the
funeral will ride in the procession. The
gun carriages to be used at Cowes and
Windsor and in London Â¦ will be painted
the color of khaki and fitted with rubber
tires.
A supplement of the Gazette this after
noon announces that it is not desired that
the public wear deep mourning after
March 6. but that half mourning should
be worn until April 17.
There, has been a strong outcry from
manufacturers and merchants at a" pro
longed period of ' mourning.- The dealers
regarded the first edict with dismay, and
great injury to the colored goods trade, in
many cases actual ruin, was predicted.
Following the precedent of 176S. when the
city merchants petitioned * Georgre III to
curtail the period of mourning, trade'cir
cles in the United Kingdom had already
started a petition to King* Edward VII

Then, tiger swift, the whole body of the
Italian was flung forward in a movement
that seemed to bring him into a straight
line, sloping upward from the tip of his
left shoe to the point of his cruel bluish
sword, which was buried or flashed under
Damotte's right armpit.
"Huh," said he.
Always impetuous "La Farla Slclllana"
Malata attacked at once. The clangor of
the battle became so rapid as to become
almost continuous.
Damotte's sword, however, had again
been damaged and had to be exchanged.

equal and skill was equal.' :If Damotte

of a vital thrust could not be given, for
the point of -that glittering yard of, steel
circled around, deadly, ; menacing, always
seeking an opening and never finding one,
but ever preventing Damotte from profit
ing from the dangerdusly deceptive Â¦- ex
posure of his adversary. Time and again
a clear ping of the point on the swonl
guard or the rapid beating of blada
against blade rang out, or the almost bar
baric "huh huh" of the flery young Sici
lian told that he had lunged.
"Halt" It was the first round. Da
motte's sword point had been blunted by
the shock against the guard of his oppo
nent's weapon. It was soon changed, the
combatants meantime standing approxi
mately where they were when the halt
was called, protected with great coats
.from the deluge that continued to fall.
Swords were again put into position and
the second reprise began.
Then suddenly every muscle seemed to
spring to life. With the right foot ad
vanced, the left hand flung upward In
counterpoise, the whole body balanced ele
gantly and the blade licking in and out,
the young manâ no, both menâ presented
a picture glorious In its very savagery.
To Damotte, as the offended, party, had
been accorded the right of imposing con
ditions, which were accepted.^ So the duel
was- to be fought In the open; air, the an
tagonists were to use swords!' to which
they were accustomed,', "corps- a corps"
was forbidden, the ground gained was to

the words "allez, messieurs^"
Damotte at once assumed his position,
but to the surprise of the onlookers the
young Italian, -holding his ; sword still
stretched at 'arm's length^ -gracefujly,
courteously and superbly brought It
around In a semi-circular, sweeping salu

asked:

ticle 7 of the treaty of peace between the

statement made in the House to-day by
Haugen of Iowa, member of- the Com
mittee on War Claims.
A bill drawn by the late Senator Davis
to confer upon a special commission juris
diction to adjudicate these claims was re
ported to the House at the last session. It
received very rough handling and was
sent back to the Committee on War
Claims, with instructions to report a bill
providing that the Court of. Claims shall
have jurisdiction.
Haugen reported the bill to-day accord

Referring to Admiral Dewey's denial
tha.t he had ever, treated the insurgents
as allies, Towne said sarcastically:
"I fear the honest sailor's terminology
has suffered from recent contact with the
nice discriminations of administration- di
plomacy." .
Discussing the acquisition of the Philip
pines, Towne said:
Tae Senator declared that we "were in
alliance with the Filipinos, an alliance
sought by ourselves, availed of by U3 for
our own advantage and finally, to our
everlasting shame in the estimation of
honorable men, repudiated by us when we
found it no longer necessary and when
lust of empire had so blunted our moral
sensibilities that we could mount from an
act of perfidy to the grand larceny of a
nation."
While discussing the events which led
the United States forces to the Philip
pines, Towne referred with particularity
to the charge that Agulnaldo had sold his
country to the Spaniards for a bribe. He
declared the accusation was "gratuitous
In Its calumny, when we consider that the
official publications of our own Govern
ment contradict and destroy it."
The rest of the day was devoted to the
Indian appropriation bill, the discussion
turning on irrigation, and little progress
being made.
In opening his address. Towne referred
to the. petition presented to the Senate a
few days ago by 2005 Filipinos for a ces
sation Of hostilities and for the granting
of independence to the people of the Phil
ippines. He maintained It would "prove
a quickening appeal to the ancient spirit
of- the republic, or its rejection must dedi
cate the twentieth century to a reaction
prejudicial, if not fatal, to free'Irisntu
tions." - - â¢ .-.Â¦â¢'.. ; . .
Immediately following Towne's speech

thd new Senator took his seat and Towne
retired.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The
Senate turned from the grind
of appropriations to listen to
a speech which partook of
the character of an oration
by Towne of Minnesota. Since he entered
the Senate a few weeks ago on appoint
ment of Governor Llnd, the young Min
nesotan has had little opportunity to dis
play his talents. As his reputation as an
orator had preceded him, there was much
interest in his speech to-day, which was
in advocacy of his resolution for a cessa
tion of hostilities in the Philippines. The
floor was crowded with Senators and
members of the House. The galleries,
public and private, were crowded to over
flowing. The Senators on the Democratic
side gave Towne marked attention. On
the Republican side the attention Was
less notable, although Hoar and Hale at
first followed the speech closely, at times
exchanging smiling comments on some of
the utterances.' Towne's style of . deliv
ery was clear and forcible. Although re
stricted by manuscript, he had the sub
ject well in hand and rolled out the fine
periods with a fervor that sent them echo
ing through the chamber. The speech
abounded in apostrophes to liberty and
patriotism and scathing and scornful ar
raignment of the policy by which the Fil
ipinos were being annihilated.
Chandler gave notice that if the Indian
appropriation bill were not disposed of
to-morrow \he would ask for niffht ses
sions.
The Senate, at S o'clock, finding Itself
without a. auorum. adjourned until to
morrow.
The -Ban Carlos irrigation amendment
was agreed to. with changes providing
that the surveys shall not commit tU~
United States to the execution of the plan
of irrigation.
Thurston proposed an amendment au
thorizing a Joint commission of three Sen
ators and three Representatives to inves
tigate the questions of forests and agri
cukure on Indian reservations. This and
several other amendments went over.
The general subject of irrigation was
discussed, Jones of Arkansas arguing
that the subject was too important to be
dealt with in an amendment to the Indian
bill, and Teller urging that it could beat
be dealt with by applying it to special
localities.
closed, which the presiding officer checked
with a warning to the galleries, but the
galleries broke again into applause a*
rowne closed/He was heartily congratu
lated by Senators anil Representatives.
Almost following Towne's speech, the
credentials of his successor, Moses i?.
Clapp of Minnesota, were presented and
he was duly sworn In. . .
The credentials of Joseph W. Bailey as
Senator from Texa-i and of F. W. Sim
mons as Senator from North Carolina
were also presented. McComas of Mary
land created something of a stfr by mov
ing that the credentials of the North Car
olina Senator bÂ© referred to the Commit
tee on Privileges and Elections.
Hoar of Massachusetts emphatically
objected, saying the people had a right to
change the present complexion of tho
Senate every two years, and that there
should be no interruption in the reception
of credentials except under most urgent
conditions and after full explanation.-*.
McComas withdrew his motion. Chandler,
chairman of the Committee on Privileges
and Elections, giving- assurance that no
rights would be waived by the present
reading of the credentials.
The Indian- appropriation bill was then
taken up, the pending amendment relat
ing to irrigation aloiiÂ£ the San Carlos
River for the benefit of the Indian land?.
Spooner and Carter urged that the broad,
general question of Irrigation should not
be prejudiced by dealing with separate
features of the subject. When the debate
had run on some time, Pettlsrew re
marked Ironically, that he was convinced
that the ship subsidy bill had been aban
doned by Republican Senators as th?y
had taken two days \o discuss this minor
amendment.

PATERSON, N. J., Jan. 23.â George J.
Kerr. who was jointly 4ndicted with' Mc-
Allster, Campbell and Death on a charge
oj criminal assault and murder In th*
first degree, in connection with the death
of Jennie Bosschleter. was unexpectedly
brought into court to-day before Judge
Dixon. when be pLeaded non vult to the
charge of assault. John M. Hardlmr,
counsel for the prisoner, addressed the
court and said that Kerr was not pres
ent when the "knockout drops" were ad
ministered to Jennie Bosscnleter and
neither did he assault the girl when sht:
was taken from the carriage on the rock
road. Counsel said that he hoped that
the prosecutor would take this into con
sideration and accept a plea of non vult.
Public Prosecutor Emiev said that white
he had made every preparation vo place
Kerr on trial on the indictment found
against him, he felt inclined to accept the
plea of r.on vult in view of the statements
by counsel as to Kerr's connection with
the girl's death, which seemed to be cor
roborated by the general facts -of tha
case. - "
Judge Dixon, after Prosecutor Emley
had accepted the plea of non vult. re
ferred to the trial of McAilster, Deam
and Campbell, and sajd that if he had
been on the jury that tried them he would
have found a verdict of murder in the
iirst degree. Judge Dixon said that as far
us Kerr was concerned the Prosecutor
had no evidence by which he could con
nect him with the drugging of Jennie
Bosschleter. Consequently the charge of
murder was eliminated from the Indict
ment. The Judge said that Sculthorpo,
the hackman, was guilty with the other 1 ;,
but that he had come forward and told
a true story of what had occurred on ths
night of the murder. Oa account of thi3
action the Prosecutor had very properly
decided not to prosecute him.
Kerr was then remanded for sentence.
He can receive a ounishment of fifteen
years.
Prosecutor Emley announced that he
would have McAilster,, Kerr, Campbell
and Death arraigned In court to-morrow
and would move that sentence be pro
nounced at once. .
It is the general opinion that all 4 the
prisoners except Kerr will receive the ex
treme penalty for murder in the second
degree, of which they were convicted. Tho
full penalty Is thirty years' imprisonment
at hard labor. It is also believed that
Kerr will be sentenced to the full penaiiy
of the law on the charge to which he has
pleaded non vult, which is fifteen. years'
Imprisonment at hard labor.
Kerr's plan of non vult contendere to
the charge of assault has the same effect
as a plea pf guilty, although technlcal'y
It is not an admission of the crime. In
effect It is an announcement that no de
fense would be offered. on- trial. In view
of the acceptance of this plea, on the
charge of assault Kerr will not be callel
upon to answer the indictment accusing
him ol murder.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 2S.â Police Officer
George Cooley made a neat capture to
day when he arrested John Muller, who,
it is alleged, has been traveling down the
roast and representing himself to be "a
Catholic priest. He has collected much
money for the "Contra Costa Orphan
Asylum," an Institution which does not
txist. N^t only has he swindled people
In this Tnanner, but he has defrauded
them in other waysâ so says Detective F.
J. Talamantes of Los Angeles, who ar
rived to take Muller back to Los Angeles,
â¢where he was very successful in his op
erations.
At Muller's room in this city was found
a trunk full of plunder, representing a
value of more than 5400. Included in the
lot is a finf realskin coat, three gold
watches, a number of razors and a costly
priest outfit. At Lcs Angeles Muller
called at the pawnbroker store of L. B.
Oohn and took out a. line gold watch,
â¢which he said -he desired to show to a
brother priest who was anxious to buy a
watch. The timepiece was not returned.
He also made collections for the alleged
Contra Costa Orphan Asylum anfl fount!
the people very generous in their contri
butions.
Bishop Montgomery was consulted and
he paid, that the man was not a priest and
â¢was not authorized to make any collec
tions. It ie said that Muller played the
tame game at all the principal cltits and
towns from San Francisco down the coast.

The amendment was defeatedâ 36 to 45.
A rather sensational passage occurred
between Flynn, delegate from Oklahoma,
and Stephens of Texas during the de
bate. , It arose out of the refusal of
Stephens early in the day to give unani
mous consent for consideration of an
Oklahoma bill.
Flynn declared that the proposed !egls â¢
lation was imperative, and ?aid if it
failed he (Stephens) would be responsible.
He. then attacked Stephens personally,
charging that he had placed In the Fort
Hall reservation bill surreptitlousy a sec
tion which no one knew was in the bill
.â¢'Then, 1 '.; he continued, "lie telegraphed
a man In Texas that he. had got the
section,in .the bill, advising- him to throw
up his job, locate a claim, and said that
he (Stephens) was 'in with it.' "
"Any â¢ one who makes that statement,
no matter who'he is." shouted Stephens,
jumping to his feet, ."tells a willful false
hood."
Â¦"Do you deny that you telegraphed to
a blacksmith to that effect?" asked Flynn
'.'I reiterate that It is a falsehood."
"I received my information of tho man
to whom the blacksmith sold out " re
plied Flynn; "but if the gentleman says
It is untrue, , I will take hia word for It"
The incident ended here.
The postal codification bill was passed.
The Senate bill to place brevet Colonel

sition which it developed anu the large

with Instructions. While the committee
was obeying the letter of *.Â»e instructions,
it was breaking it in spirit. Members had
been taicen completely by surprise, he
said, by the way in which it was now pro

bill. ,
The Senate bill to confer upon the court
of claims jurisdiction to adjudicate claims
of citizens of the United States, which the
United States agreed to settle by the
terms of article 7 of the treaty of Paris,
aroused "* considerable " discussion. The
original Senate bill for the appointment of
a commission- to investigate the claims,
which already aggregate $28,000,000. was
recommitted to the Committee on War
Claims, with instructions to report back
a bill to refer the claims to the court of
claims. After Haugen of Iowa had ob
tained unanimous consent for the con
sideration of the â¢Â» mended bill as reported
back -by the ? committee, stating that it
complied with the instructions of the
House, he took the floor and argued
against the amended bill on the ground
that the court of claims already was over
loaded with work and that to refer thj
claims to that" court turely amounted to
repudiation. He asked the House to vote
down the amended bill and pass the origi

the fact as to whether the waters of the

Springer said:*
"To-day's decision merely brings, the

that, instead of inflicting damages, the

Information regarding the report

Pate Island by an armed expedition from
the Venezuelan gunboat Augusto or the
reported - occupation of Guiria, on the
Gulf of Paria, by the Insurgents. />
The British and American legations also
assert that they have no dertnite knowl
edge on either subject.
On the northern shore of the Gulf of
Paria the rebels, by a succession of quick
movements and smtll but decisive vic
tories, have made themselves masters of
the two principal ports on that part of
the coast, Irapa and Guiria. To the south
of the gulf some twenty miles lie the
asphalt lakes, over the possession of
which serious complications are threat-
ened. These are in the former State of
Bermudez, about midway between- the
Maturin and Guarar.uano rivers. The
part claimed by the trust under the con
cession which has been annulled by the
Venezuelan Government Is about four
miles square.
The asphalt trust has built a railroad,
ten miles in length, from the asphalt lake
to the Maturln 'River, on which the vlP
lag*? of Guanaco is located. The trust has
millions of dollars invested in the rail
road, asphalt refineries, docks and the
steamships which sail between Guanaco
and New York. One-third of the asphalt
lake, nearest the Guaraguano River, is
claimed by the American capitalists, who
have bought "La Felicidad" concession.
The promoters purpose to build a railroad
from the asphalt deposit to the Guara
guano River, which is also navigable.
Further proceedings on the part of all
parties to the dispute may be indefinitely
suspended by the rtbel movement which
has now come so near them. ' >

Finance Committee Puts
.Off Action on ProDosed
ADDroDriation,
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan.^ 28.â There was
quite an audience' before the Sen
ate Finance Committee this even-
Ing- when the question of appro
priating $100,000 for the benefit of
the State Agricultural Society and its
debt came up for consideration. The bill
is one that provides for .an appropriation
to pay debts and to make improvements,
but with the money appropriated to make
Improvements the society wishes to pur
chase lands. The expectation is that It
could sell certain portions of the present
tract and, with the money so obtained,
reimburse the Stafe for what it may put
up for repairs, #mt the society wishes to
purchase the land at once.
The bill was advocated by Frederick
Cox, Dr. W. P. Mathews and J. "W. Wil
son, members of the society, and Judge
Peter J. Shields, w-ho recently was Its
secretary. These gentlemen were closely
questioned br the members o* the com
mittee, and thÂ© needs of the appropria
tion were finally narrowed down to these:
The society Is $10,000 in debt and wishes
to pay this sum out of the appropriation,
and it also desires to expend $t>O,Oyu in im
provements.
There was a great deal of misunder
standing: over the question of title to the
lands. It appears that while the, society
Is a State institution, the property it holds
is in the individual names of the members
of the society. It was asked why the
property was not held in the name of the
State, If the State was to pay the debts
the institution had incurred, and the an
swer was that should the State get held
of the land and it should increase In value
It would be possible for tho State to sell
the land for what purpose it pleased, but
so long as the land was held in the name
of the society the Institution could be car
ried on.
'Tou are not willing, then, to trust the
State in the future management of this
fair?" queried Senator Rowell when this
explanation had been made.
It was also asked why the society had
allowed Its debts to run along until they
had assumed such large proportions and
it was further demanded why, if what, tho
society wanted was money for improve
ments and to pay debts, it did not put in
a bill for that purpose without loading it
down with irrelevant ana complicating
provisions. Then Rowell asked plalnly
if. should tliÂ« State pay the $40,000 for
which the society were Indebted, the so
ciety would turn over the land.
"Not for $40,000," was the answer.
"Then this is a speculation." said Row
ell.
"Xo, It Is not a speculation,'! said Dr.
Matthews, "but the land is worth more
than that."
"But if the society is a State institution.
has not the State the right to take It any
way?"
"That would be to abolish the society,"
said Matthews.
"But has not the State the right to abol
ish the society?" persisted Rowell.
Dr. Matthews looked knowingly at his
colleagues.
"1 don't know about that." heeald.
It was finally intimated that if the soci
ety would be willing to listen to a proposi
tion for an appropriation of $40,000, the
socieiy to deed the land in Sacramento t>
the state and Che State to take a hand -n
future State fair ventures, some consid
eration, might be given it and then the
question was laid over until next Friday.
The committee is not satisfied with the
land-purchase scheme, and probably w 11
not accept the bill in anything 1 like Its
present Ehape.

Chairman Bliss explained afterward
that it was not the committee's Intention
to shut out any attempt to aid the com
jp.itu-e in its work; but* in order that the
investigation might proceed in aa orderly
manner, it was deemed best to adopt a
one which would prevent overzealoua in
dividuals with grievances, or attorneys
representing sucn individuals, jumping in
Â¦uitii questions Irrespective ot their bear-Â«
ing- oa the general line of the investiga
tion.
The committee decided that the inter
rogating should be of a nature to draw
out answers to the following questions:
1. Was a proper exhibit made â one
â¢within the meaning of the act creating
the commission?
2. Was the appropriation honestly ex
pended to that end?
3. Did the Commissioners and their at
taches by their conduct, while in Paris,
disgrace themselves and the State which
they represented?
Members of the committee hint myste
riously of having letters in their posses
sion which %rl!i place those connected
vith the commission in a bad light. Those
letters are said to bear upon the award
ing tÂ»f premiums and medals, which
â¢would suggest a line of questioning not
ir.dicatcd under the three heads outlined
fcy the committee to-day.
Comrmtteeman Melicic went south to
pather up information from the Truman
camp, but he found cold comfort there.
He subpenaed young Robert Ross, son of
Judpe Ersklne Uoss. to tell of things
which transpired while he was an at
tache of the commission. Melick talked
with George Rice, publisher of the West
ern Graphic, the paper whose publication
in detail of Major Ben C. Truman's bitter 1
trralenments of his colleagues started
the clamor which ended in the Investiga
tion being ordered by the Assembly.
Melick's purpose was to get the letters ;
nnd whatever documentary evidence Tru
man had sent to Joseph E. Lynch, the
editor of Rice's paper.
Rice asked If Lynch was not to be sub
penacd. and Melick said that would be
useless, as Lynch had no personal knowl
edge of the Commissioners' conduct- Rice
said thry wore willing the 'documents in
1 htlr possession should be taken to Sacra
ncnto if they could go In lunch's posses
rinn. and if LjTich coulcj appear at the
investigation to look out for Truman's
interests, but not otherwise.
MclSck replied that Lynch could appear
lwfore the committee at his owa expense.
1 ut that he was not willing to place the
< ornrr.ittfce in the position of paying the
Â« xpenws of a man to look out for tha ln
zFTcr'e n? the Commissioner from South
Â« rn California.
It developed that Truman had sent
Lynch a set of questions which he wanted
put to Foote and Runvon, but Rice said
ihoir nnture would rot be disclosed un
1Â«Â»fs I^ynch should appear before the com
mitifo. Up eaid they could not afford to
OKWee the character of their evidence
rn!cs.Â« they were sure it would be prop
Â« r' A- npfd.
;.ifli<lc's solution of the problem was to
leave a Fubpcna. for Lynch In the hands
rf the Los Angelas Sheriff, to be served
upon the order of th? committee.
At th<Â» rr.petln*r tb!si afternoon the com
mittee drcirled that for the present Lynch
would rot bp Mibpenaed. Chairman Bliss
reported that Foote. Runyon and Gasklll

BURGLARS FAIL TO GET
STOCK OF DIAMONDS
Foiled by a Small Spring in the Safe
of a Seattle Manufacturer
of Jewels. â¢
SEATTLE. Jan. a.â A little spring, re
cently introduced into the mechanism of
"burglar-proof" safSs, proved a stumbling
block to expert robbers who were after
$10,000 worth of uncut diamonds and other
Jewelry owned by Henry Hensel, a man
ufacturing Jeweler In the Hlnckley block.
The burglars left most of their tools be
hind, a seven and a half pound sledge
hammer, a thirty-Inch crowbar, eight
steel drills, two punches and a wood bit
being found in front of the safe.
The attempted burglary was unusually
bold. The Hlnckler block la on Second
avenue and Columbia street, in the heart
of the business district, where there are
many passers-by at all hours of the night.
The burglars began their attack on the
safe by attaching clamps to the combina
tion knob and" tearing it from its socket.
The force necessary to do this was so
great that three small holes were gouged
in the front of the safe at tho points
where the clamps rested. After remov
ing the knob the burglars, with the aid
of a steel punch and sledge hammer,
drove the combination pin out, exposing
the combination. r ,. : - v:
The safe Itself was op to date in its
fittings and besides being unusually strong
contained a burglar proof contrivance in
troduced only recently by . the manu
facturers. There Is a secret spring con
tained In the mechanism which operates
the lever that falls and locks the bolts
after the tumblers have been released in
any violent manner â that -13, unless they
are released by properly working 1 the
combination. . .
After the robbers had succeeded in pry
ing out the knob and releasing the tumb
lers in the same this spring fell and held
the bolts despite the efforts of the safe
crackers, who probably were not aware of
Its existence. _

In- sight in his pocket, the robber walked
from the office a hundred feet to the rail
road tracks, where he boarded a passing
freight train. Irvin/was alone and it waa
some time before he attracted passers
by to release him and made the robbery
known to the police.
Ched Coverdale and Ralph Myer -were
arrested near the Union station on sus
picion of being guilty of the robbery.
Later Cashier Irvin positively Identified
Coverdale as the n-san who entered the
office and robbed him. It is supposed that

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 28.â There was a lively row
before the joint committee on county
government this afternoon. On one side
were some taxpayers of Tuba, who want

Senator Cutter, who is one of the officials,
and Mr. Forbes, who came to help Cut
ter. The row was over a bill so amend
ing the county government act as to re
duce salaries in Yuba County.
It was shown that the assessment roll
was growing smaller, while salaries
were at the same standard, and the tax
paying contingent thought all should go
down together. Cutter and Forbes said
the roll was going down because people
were dodging ta.xes and the visiting dele
gation retaliated by saying Cutt*-r and
Forbes were of the "Courthouse" ring. A
call from the Senate intervened to break
up the meeting, and the question will be
fought out later.

OLD PEOPLE
Have a charm of their own when they
are not weak and feeble, but hale and
hearty, enjoying the sports and pleasures
of yoath though they cannot participate
in them. * The whole secret of a sturdy
old age is this : Keep the stomach and
organs of digestion and nutrition In per-
fect order. The yotrae man who does
not think of his stomach will be made to
think of it as he grows old. It is tha
n weak " stomach, incapable of supplying
the adequate nutrition for the body,
which causes the weakness and feeble-
ness of old age.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It

CINCINNATI, Jan. 2S.â Late to-ntght
both Jeftries and Ruhlln' were arrested on
a warrant sworn out by several persons
interested in the coming fight, who acted
at the instigation of the Saengerfest Ath
letic Association, charging them with be
ing In training for a prizefight, which Is
a violation of the law in this State. The
two fighters were taken before Squire
Roebllng, who released both on bond, fur
nished by one James Wilder. A test case
is to be made of their arrest. Roebllns
Is a magistrate in Delhi Township, with
an office not far from Jeffries' training
quarters.-
It is not' known to-night what action,
if ' any, the opposition to the fight will
take to-morrow.
The. bonds were fixed at I1GO0 each and
the men were ordered to appear for trial
on Thursday morning. ' '

Warrants Sarved on Jeffries and Ruh-
Both fighters \ took things easy to-day.

PRINCIPALS ABE ARRESTED.
Manager Cook has received orders for
tickets from nearly every State In the
Union.
CINCINNATI. Jan. 28.â The sale of seats
for the . Jeftries-Ruhlln contest opened
early this morning and passed all expecta
tions. Over ?S0OO worth, of seats were dis
posed of within the first hour. Manager
Cook stated to-night that the sale for tho
day was about $20,000. There were several
applicants for $5 seats, but no general ad
mission tickets will be sold until the day
of the contest. No seats have been served
on orders, nor will there be until tho local
demand has been satisfied.
This action was taken by the Governor
In responsa,to the solicitations of a num
ber of leadlns attorneys of Cincinnati.
The petition in the case will be immed
iately filed In the courts at Cincinnati.
The suit will be entitled the State ex rel.
the Attorney General vs. J. J. Jeffries,-
Gus Ruhlln, William N. Hobart, George
Quggrenheimer, Leopold Kleibolt. Bernard
Bettman, George F. Dleterle, F. A. Lee.
Fenton T. Lawson, Rev. B. A. Eisenlohr
and thirty-one others, associates In the
management of the Cincinnati Saenger
fest Company. The form of the suit will
be a petition for an injunction against the
persons named, based on the claim that
they are about to perpetrate a public
nuisance. It Is on thl3 claim of nuisance
that It Is hoped to, avoid the question of
whether the contest is a prize fight or a
boxing contest.
The attorneys who were In consultation
with Governor Nash and Attorney General
Sheets at the State capital to-day In ref
erence to the proposed Jeffries-Ruhlin
fight in this city, returned to Cincinnati
to-night, but too late to file- the petition
for an Injunction. The suit against the
directors and members of the Saengerfest
Club will be brought in one of the local
courts. One of the local Judges recently
instructed the Grand Jury to bring: In
dictments-against the members of the
Saengerfest Athletic Association, and the
promoters of the ficht feel that they
would be enjoined at once if the Injunc
tion was asked for in his court. The dis
position of the different Judges has been
much commented upon to-dav. and It Is
thought by some that there are one or two
Judges. who approve of the Instructions to
the Grand Jury, though it is said that
most of the Judges here did not approve
of that action. At any rate, according to
the street talk to-night; much depends
upon the judge before whom the petition
for an Injunction is heard, as' the RtÂ«
tofneys who present the petition represent
the ministers and all others opposing the
prize flght, it is generally conceded that
they wtll go into the courts In which they
think they have the best chance to secure
an injunction.-
While the drift of local opinion is that
the flght will be pulled off here on Febru
ary 15, yet the proceedings in Columbus
to-day throw another obstacle in the
way of tne promoter?. It Is believed that
the athletic association will reply to the
petition promptly without claiming time
for preparation, jo that all doubts will be
removed as soon as possible. It is thought
that the present legal proceedings will be
over within two or three days.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Jan. 23.â Action
was taken by Governor Nash to
day to prevent the Jeffrles-Ruhlin
fight at Cincinnati on February 15.
The Governor has been opposed to
the fight being held In the State, and to
day he sent the following letter to At
torney General Sheets:
"It has come to my knowledge that cer
tain persons In Cincinnati are to conduct
an enterprise In that city on the 15th of
February next which has all the ear
marks of being a prize fl*ht. Such an
event would be a dl6Â»race to the State of
Ohio as well as a violation of the law,
and I hereby authorize and request you
to take such steps and commence such
action at law, civil or criminal, as may
be necessary to prevent this occurrence,
and In so doing to use the name of the
State. Very respectfully yours.

BILL GARRETT. the consistent
Missouri-bred Reldlng 1 . started the
week well at Tanforan Park yes
terday by defeating Gold Or arid
Ordnung in the seven and one
half furlong purse run. For reasons es
sentially their own the owners of Garrett
start him In no selling events, even
though his name is not coupled with the
stake division. Gold Or, ridden by Clem
Jenkins, was favorite in the betting, but
ran as if not keyed to concert pitch. Bill
Oarrett, with 111 pounds in the saddle,
won nil the way.
Young Domlnick ha-J the leg up on the
winner, and the pair constitute a formid
able combination. Since the season
opened Hill has competed In eight ra'cef",
six of them resulting in victories. Ord
nunpr tvas never a contender.
It was ndt much of an afternoon for fa
vorites, as Joe Frey and Credo, the Jump
er, were the only 3hort-prlced ones to
earn brackets. Even with four upset*
the ring is reported 10 have experienced
another unprofitable Inning.
True Blue and Joe Frey see-sawed for
the honors of favoritism in the betting in
the first event, a six-furlong run. At
post time It was 2 to 1 and take your pick.
J. Walsh had the mount on Joe Frey and
after Frank Bell and Sad Sam had hud
enough of the clip they set, came on, win
ning hands down In 1:12%, a new track
record. True Blue was outfooted from
the start.
. Undoubtedly the worst performance of
the day from a time standpoint was the
win of Bab in the mile event. Marshal
Neil looked pounds and away the best.
but was afflicted with no speed whatever.
Tony Lepping made the running, only to
be downed alength at the end. in l:43?i.

sider could have won with ease.* â¢ Instead
of going out In the lead when he could
have done so; See took his mount bqck
and was then pockettd. As It was. he
finished a fast closing third.* .:
The steeplechase, over two and a half
miles, went to Credo, carrying 163 pounds
and an even money favorite. The Morello

Brave Nurses and Interne Down as
Result of Attending a
Patient.
Two nurses and one interne are down
with diphtheria at the City and County
Hospital and grave fears are felt for their
safety. They are Misses Edith Wildes
and Ethel Green and Vr- Louis Saph
They all 'contracted the dreaded diseaÂ«x;
through a patient named George Rugglcs,
who is Ftill suffering from it and likely
to die. It is feared that other cases will
develop in the hospital.
The matter was- so serious that It was
especially considered by the Board of
Health yesterday forenoon and it was re-
Folvod to appeal to the Supervisors :o
have a building erected on the hospital
grounds for contagious cases other than
smallpox. One of the unfortunate nurses
is now battling against death In a rickety
election booth.
Th<Â» Supervisors yesterday afternoon ap
propriated $2500 to be used In erecting such
a building as asked for by the Health
Board. -' . .
It seems fairly certain, according to
downtown rumors, which are not denied
by members of tho firm, that the big dry
goeds establishment of Raphael Weill &
Co.. which has under the name of "The
White House" been a familiar landmark
In the shopping district for many years,
will soon seek new quarters. The store
will be moved. It is said, to the newly
planned Flood building as soon as It is
completed. The new building will be on
the site of the old Baldwin Hotel at Mar
ket and Powell streets. When Been lat>t
ni>;ht Eugene Gailols, first vice president
of the White House firm, tacitly admitted
that the rumor was substantially correct.
Just what will take the place of the
White House is not known, but to old
timers on the parade the corner of Post
and Kearny streets will look strange
without the big store, its windows filled
with fabrics of gorgeous hue, its great
plate glass windows and crowd of eager
buyers.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.â A little more
than a week ago the home of Frank I.
Smith at Santa Anita was one 'of the
model buildings of the San Gabriel Val
ley. The family consisted of the father,
the mother and a son of 4 years. To-day
the child is dead, the mother is In an In
sane asylum and the father in his lone
some home is striving vainly to forget his
grief. Mrs. Smith during a fit of insanity
last Wednesday shot her boy and then
turned the revolver on herself, making an
ugly-looking but not serious wound above
the eye. She was sent to-day to the asy
lum at Highland.
Mrs. Smith had read the accounts of the
Cudahy kidnaping case and worked her
self up to such a stage of fear that her
boy would be stolen that she took his life
"to save it," she said.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.â B. C. Whit
ney, the embezzling Postmaster of Cam
bria, was arraigned before Judge Well
born In the United States District 'Courv
to-day and pleaded guilty. He asked the
court to send him to the San Luis Oblspo
Jail instead of to the Los Angelas Jail.
Whitney is about 60 years of age. and
was charged with embezzling $390 91 and
failing to deposit other funds of the Post
office Department, making the total
amount of his shortage $600. The amount
has been made good to the Government
by Whitney's bondsmen, to whom he
turned over what little property he had.
Whitney Is a cripple and walks with the
aid of two canes. One foot and leg are
badly withered and about half the size of
the other leg. Unlteo. States District At
torney Flint informed the court that there
were extenuating circumstances in the
case of Whitney, which made it hard to
ask for ,,the maximum sentence of ten
years' imprisonment; that the man was a
cripple, had four children and had never
before been convicted of a crime.
Judge Wellborn sentenced him to a
year's Imprisonment and a fine of $390 9L

ACCEPTS A SAN
FRANClSCO CALL
A CELEBRATED i CASE." by the
author of the "Two Orphans,"
drew a crowded house at the Cen
tral Theater last night, and the
audience enjoyed the old favor
ite melodrama Â¦with much 'applauding of
the hero and heroine and much execration
cf the villain and a display of .wet hand
kerchiefs that caused the sobbing actors
and actresses to smile behind their tears.
For a first-night performance the play
went remarkably well, not a single nitch
occurring through the prologue and the
lour equally as long acts that follow It.
The house rose up on the appearance of
the old favorite, James M. Ward, the
Irish comedian, who not only talks the
brogue naturally, but acts the Irishman
"to the Queen's taste." The rousing re
ception he received brought tears to the
eyes of the veteran. The company fits
the play like a glove. There Is not a
weak character in it. Miss Fay Courtney
as Adrienne. Howard Hall as the un
justly condemned Jean Renaud and Mlron
Leffingwell as the bogus Count de Mor
nay shared the honors of the piece. Lit
tle five-year-old Baby Martine gave a
wonderful exhibition of acting, her enun
ciation being remarkably distinct. "A
Celebrated Case" has caught on.
. California.
Mrs. Fiske began the second week of
her brilliant performance of the name
role in "Becky Sharp" last evening at
the California Theater. A most enthusi
astic house greeted -the -efforts of the
actress in her marvelous rendering of the
philosophical adventuress' part, and the
wiuy speeches which Langdon Mitchell
has given to Thackeray's naughty heroine
were received with a continuous ripple of
laughter throughout- the entire evening.
This is the last week of the play, which
will be followed by Mrs. Flske's earliest
and perhaps greatest success, "Tess of
the d'Urbervilles." "Tess" affords a val
ued opportunity for others In the com
pany, among them Francesca Lincoln, a
California girl, whose Marian has been
much admired by the critics. The sale
of f-eats for "Tess" will begin on Thurs
day morning next.
Tivoli.
The opera "The Fencing Master," with
its pretty scenery, fetching costumes and
new lighting effects, commenced Its sec
ond week at the Tivoli Opera-house last
night. The house was crowded. Ferris
Hartman, Edward Webb, Maud Williams,
Tom Greene. Annie Myers, Bernicc
Holmes and the other principals were
loudly applauded, and encores were num
erous.
Alcazar.
William Gillette's farcical comedy, "All
the Comforts of Home," was appreciative
ly received at the "Alcazar last night.
The play has apparently lost none of Its
popularity, and went with a swing from
the beginning of the first act. _*, j '~V
Frank Curtis, who appeared In San
Francisco for the first time, quite filled
the part of Theodore Bender, a. retired
produce dealer, and got a gratifying re
ception. - .* , . .
As Robert Pittlbone. a peculiarly jeal
ous man. Richard Webster shared with
Miss Juliet Crosby, as Ro3abelle Pltti

of the principal characters.
Howard Scott as Christopher Dabney,

swooped down upon him for embezzling
the saddle. The owner became tired- of
waiting for Its return and swore out a
complaint '(Charging >, him with petit lar

The nine Nelsons, whirlwind acrobats,
are the star attraction at the Orpheum
this week. Their movements are so rapid
and their feats so clever and daring that
the audience Is kept in a fever of enthus
iasm all the time they are on the stage.
Two small boy3 and a" girl are wonders
in their way. The Learner sisters, who
bear a strong: resemblance to two of the
Nelsons, are clever contortionists, and

THE POPULAR IRISH COMEDIAN WHO APPEARED LAST NIGHT AT
BELASCO & THALL'S CENTRAL THEATER IN THE ROLE OF SER
GEANT O'ROURKE IN "A CELEBRATED CASE." .
The communication filed by Joseph W.
Goldstein, with notice of judgment ob
tained against St. Mary's Park fund, was
referred to the City Attorney for his opin
ion as to the power of the board to ap
prove the claim.
The resolution directing the Board of
Works to install twelve coal oil stoves in
the Recorder's office was opposed by
Brandensteln, who held that there would
be danger from fire if they were used.
The resolution was amended so as to di
rect the Board of Works to Install a gas
heating plant to cost $1000.
The application of the Olympic Club to
be allowed to give a boxing exhibition
from January 30 to February 2 was
granted.
The 1 ordinance providing for the con
struction and control of automatic sprink
ler equipments in manufacturing plants
was finally passed.
The ordinance to prevent the manufac
ture and sale of any food adulterant or
preservative was deferred for one week
in order to give the packing interests an
opportunity to be heard.
The resolution providing for the erection
of a nurses' building in connection with
the City and County Hospital, at a cost
of $2000, was finally passed.
The Mayor's veto of the ordinance reg
ulating the use of streets for the pur
pose of placing therein pipes and other
conduits was sustained. An amended ord
inance was passed to print which com
plies with the charter in that it compels
the Board of Public Works to perform
the Â¦work of tearlne: up the streets for
purposes other than the laying of pipes
lor supplying light and water.
The ordinance establishing _ regulations
for the construction and maintenance, of
dairies was passed to print. Hotaling op
posed its passage because it was intro
duced at the request of the Milkers' Un
ion. The ordinance requires dairy owners
to provide clean quarters for their milk
men and forbids the taking of milk from
any cow not in a clean condition.
The board reconsidered the ordinance
extending the pound limits to the county
line, which was defeated at the last meet
ing. The measure was finally passed on
reconsideration, after Comte had spoken
in favor of It, by the following vote:
Ayes â Booth, Brandensteln, Braunhart,
Comte, Connor, Hotaling, McCarthy, Staf
ford, Tobln and Wilson; noesâ Boxton,
Curtis, D'Ancona, Dwyer and Jennings.
Braunhart's ordinance fixing the rate of
etreet car fare to be charged to pupils
attending public and private schools at
2^2 cents was finally passed by the Board
of Supervisors yesterday. The measure
will not become a law. however, until
the Mayor has affixed his signature there
to. The vote on final passage was taken
without any comment, ft being as fol
lows: Ayesâ Booth, Boxton, Branden

Assessor Dodge's expensive cabinet
Â¦which is to be used in connection, with the
new "card Eystem," which has thus far
proved impracticable in his office, was the
r-ubject of discussion at the meeting of
i he Board of Supervisors yesterday. The
matter came up when a resolution was
introduced authorizing the payment of
JiaÂ» in addition to the original cost of 5208.
as bid by the lirm of Payot. Upham & Co.
Hen Upham endeavored to explain the ap
plication for the increased allowance, but
with poor success. Deputy Assessor
Ginty stated that the firm had bid on
specifications as originally prepared by
him, but these had been changed by a
specialty company at his instigation.
Ciinty -would not answer when Supervisor
Stafford asked him why he had not re
ferred the matter to the board when the
sj>ecÂ»:cations were changed. It developed
thÂ«Â±t the cabinet had. been ordered by the
Priming Committee, though the Building
ComrrJttee was the proper body to make
the authorization. The cabinet is to be
I>aid out of the urgent necessity fund,
though it can hardly be considered an
urgent necessity, as xt has not yet been
put In actual use. The resolution, autnor
lzlng the additional expenditure of $KS
was dtfeated.
Another erroneous assessment levied by
Assessor Dodge was corrected by the
adoption of a resolution reducing the levy
of $7000 on the estate of Angus tH. McMil
lan to iZjir: The difference represents the
assessed valuation cf solvent credits er
roneously duplicated on the roll and en
tered under the bead of personal property.
Supervisor McCarthy directed attention
to two demands for the refunding of
duplicate poll. taxes to James Palmer and
Robert Irishman, which the Auditor re
luses to audit. The Auditor, while recog
nizing the justice of the claims, contends
that they call for the sum of J4. whereas
only *3 40 went into the States coffers, j
The other CO cents is in the city treasury I
tfr.d represents the Assessor's commls- <
Â£io;is lor collecting the taxes. The amount
is included In some $13,000 which the Su- :
preme Court is to decide whether it be
longs to the city or to the Assessor. Me-
Carthy introduced a resolution directing
that when poll taxes are to be refunded
the Assessor be directed to turn over the
commission to the Treasurer.
The ordinance granting ar.d transferring
a lot of land adjoining the Girls' Hign
tSchool on u'Karrell street for use as a site
whereon to erect the San Francisco State
Normal School was rereierred to the Judi
ciary Committee. State Normal School
Trus:Â«vÂ» Cooney will appear before the
committee to discuss the legal phase of the
ordinance. Brandenstein asked that such
fcetion be taken, as there is some doubt
whether the board has the right to trans
it r the site, there being a Supreme Court
decision which holds that the board has
i:ot the power.
The resolution memorializing the Legis
lature to pass the act appropriating $100,
(*M fur the construction of a normal school
building was referred to the Judiciary
O inm:ttee.
The sum of JGOOO was appropriated from
the urgent necessity fund to furnish with
ct-!!s, interior fittings and office apparatus
the Mission police station.
The ordinance providing for the inspec
tion of steam boilers and gasoline engines
by the Fire Marshal every three months
was passed to print.
Clitup Harbour was appointed to revise
the ordinances to comply with the charter
iii a salary of $100 per month for four
months.
The Park Commissioners were author
ized to improve Bernal Park and to draw
on the fund of J25CW for the work.

BOARD REFUSES
TO RAISE DEMAND
ganization of Sacramento Lodge Xo. 2. I find
by looking over the roll that there is no
brother now living who assisted in the organ
ization of Sacramento Lodge, on January 28,
1851. I Joined the order by initiation on the
2Sth day Â«l January. 1853. forty-eight . years
ago, and I regret to say that there 13 not an
other member now living who was a member
at that time. I have also examined the ros
ter of California Lodge No. 1, of San Fran
cisco, and I find that no member now living
was a member of that lodge In 1833.
I fine from tradition that Odd Fellowship
had its bpglnnnlng in the year A. D. 55..- It
was. first established by the Roman soldiers.
In the camp In that year, during the reign of
Nero.' They were called Fellow I Citizens. In
the j'^ar 79 Titus Caesar gave them the name
of Odd Fellows, from their singularity of no
tions, and from their knowing each other by
day or night, and for their fidelity to him
and their country he not only gave them the
name of Odd Fellows, but at the same time,
as a pledge of friendship, presented them with
a .'llipensation, engraved on a plate of gold,
leaiins different emblems, such as the sun.
moi.n, stars, the lamb, the lion, the dove, and
the emblems of mortality, and most of these
emblems are In use In our order to-day.
The first account of the order being spread
- In other countries'ls In the fifth century, when
. It was established In the Spanish dominions,
and In the twelfth century it was established
In Franceâ and afterward, .by De Novllla, in
J'nglana. attended by five knights from France,
who formed a Loyal Grand Lodge of Honor
In â¢ London, which order remained "until the
eighteenth century (In the reign of George
III), ufe*n a part of them began to form
themselves Into a union known as the Man
chester Unity, which is really the parent of
the Incependent Order of Odd Fellows in our
own country. .
The first meeting of the order in California
was held In San Francisco, In 1847, at the
Portsmouth House. This lodge had a member
ship of thirty in 1848. but on the discovery of
gold every member left for the mines. Their
building and regalia . were ' destroyed by fire
and the by-laws and constitution Io3t. This
lodge never had a charter.
In the latter part of 1848 another lodge was
Instituted under the same name. California
No. 1, and this lodge was the first' to receive
a dispensation.
As you. know, our lodge was the second
lodge organized in the State of California,
fifty years ago to-day.
On August 20, 1849, a general meeting was
held of all Odd Fellows in this city to take
measures - 'or , the relief of the sickness and
destitution prevalent to a frightful degree In
their midst. The city government was power
leF" â had, in fact, scarcely made an effort to
do anything. Hundreds were sick, lying In
their blankets. An association of sixty mem
bers was formed, .with A. M. AVinn as presi
dent, and they worked nobly and sacrificed
their time for the cause to . which they had
pledged themselves. Their labor and self
denial, their kindly syirpathles and ready aid
form one of the few bright spots in that era
of supreme selfishness.
An Odd Fellows' and Masons' hospital was
afterward erected at- a cost of $36,000. and It
is estimated that the association . spent not
less than $200,000 in charitable purposes during
1849.
Taken Into consideration that all of the pio
neers came to California to dig gold and re
turn home, as the people now go to Alaska
to dig gold and return home, too much praise
cannot be given to the early Odd Fellows and
Masons of California, who fed the hungry,
clothed the naked and burled the dead. - . .
On May 17, 1S53, the past grands of eight
lodges met and formed the Grand Lodge of
California. In 1S98 we had 386 lodges in Cal
ifornia, all in a flourishing condition, and more
have been organized since 1S93, the number
of which I do not knew. .
In September, 1851, the Rebekah Degree of
Odd Fellowship was authorized through the
efforts of Schuyler Cclf ax. In the year 1S97
the Rebekahs of the Grand Jurisdiction of
America expended J51.0CO In relief. This rep
resents only a portion of the work done as
benevolence and human sympathy cannot be
estimated In dollars and cents.. The Orphans*
Home at Gllroy, dedicated October 27, 1S37,
is "a lasting monument to the Daughters of
Rebekah.
Â¦The Odd Fellows' Home at- Thermalito was
dedicated on January 26, 1S95. This home pro
vides a home for those brothers who have
been . overtaken by sickness or Â¦ old age and
glvts them a home where, they can spend their
declining years In peace and happiness.
Brothers, I will say : In conclusion that at
the centennial celebration of Sacramento Lodge
No. 2, fifty years from now. that I will not be
here, but' I hope that some, of the brothers
may live to be present at that time and will
speak a good .word for the absent ones who
have joined the large majority and who tried
to fulfill our duties to our Maker and our kind.
The celebration closed with a splendM
banquet. -.. . Â¦ â¢ '
SACRAMENTO, Jon. 2S.-The fiftieth
anniversary of the institution of Sacra
mento Lodge Xo. 2. Independent Order of
Odd Fellows, 'was celebrated In this city
to-night with exercises and festivities that
promise to remain long remembered . in
the annals of Odd Fellowship in this
State. Odd Fellows'. Temple at Ninth and
K : streets, one of the largest and most
substantial buildings in the city, "was the
scene of a reception, at which there were
present a number, of the -grand, officers
of , the order and hundreds of members
of the lodges In this city, and surrounding
localities. Among the grand officers. were:
W. .W. Watson of San Francisco, Vrantl
master; AVilliam Nicholls Jr. 'of Dutch
Flat, deputy grand master; M. G. Gale of
Red Bluff, grand warden;- George T.
Shaw of Sa"n Francisco, .grand secretary;
James W. Harris of San Francisco, grand
treasurer. - Â¦ .' . ..,-Â¦",
An interesting feature of the programme
was the reading: of the old form "of ritual
of the order, which proved something of
a revelation to the younger members.
"William Beckman, president. of the Peo
ple's Bank of this city and former. Rail
road Commissioner, was one of the most
interesting personages present. Mr. Beck
man has the distinction of being the old
est Odd Fallow in the State, based upon
the date of a member's admission to the
organization 4n California. Mr. Beckman
delivered an address which dealt with in
teresting phases of the history of Odd Fel
lowship in this State. He spoke in part as

Hospitals in bur great cities are sad.places to visit.
Three-fourths of the patients lying on those snow-white,
beds are women and girls.
Why should this be the case ?
Because they have neglected themselves.
; Every one of these patients in the hospital beda-had'plenty
of warning in that bearing-down feeling, pain at the left or
right, of the womb, nervous exhaustion, pain in thÂ© small of
the back. All of these things are indications of anamhealthy
condition of the ovaries or womb.
What, a terrifying thought ! * these poor souls are lying
there on those hospital beds awaiting a fearful operation.
Do not drag along at home or in your place of. employ-
ment until you are obliged to go to the hospital and submit to
an examination and possible operation. ; Build up the female

selves by danger signals, and remember that I/ydia E,

that the settler has changed his residence

RURAL. FREE DELIVERYâ S., Pa
checo. Cal. The following are the govern
mental instructions in regard to the estab
lishment of free rural delivery:
Present a petition, addressed to the First
Assistant Postmaster General, signed by those
who desire the service. This petition should
be signed only by heads of families and should
mention the number in each family. It should
get forth the natore of the country where the
delivery Is desired, whether densely or Bparnelv
populated. the principal avocations of the peo
ple, the. character of the roads and the dla
tancea which under existlnr conditions each
patron has to travel to receive his mall, and
should be accompanied wherever possible by a
rough map indicating: the route or routes pro
posed. TWa â¢ petition, when properly signed,
should be sent to your Representative in Con
gress or to one of your Senators, with a re
quest that he Indorse thereon his recommenda
tion of the service . asked, and forward the
petition to the department. The free deliv
ery of walls in rural districts is not to rrant
a suburban delivery^to cities Included in the
free delivery service, nor to establish a village
free delivery. , Tie purpose of thÂ« system Is *Â©
give postal facilities to those who have none;
to carry the mails daily to remote rural com
munities, the residents of which would other
wise have to travel from two to twelve miles
to receive their letters and newspapers. Ths
roads must be good. This Is an essential pre
requisite to any investigation. Xo route can
be established that Is less than SO to 23 miles
In" length I or which serves lesa than 100 fam
ilies. The route should be arranged that the
carrier will not be required to . travel o\'er the
fame ground twice on the same day. These
desiring the delivery must be prepared to put
up at. their own expense at some convenient
location which can be. reached by- the carrier
without dismounting from his* buggy appro
priate and secure boxes for the receDtlon of
the United States malls. Rural carriers an
not required to deliver mall *r> houses standing
back from the main road* /The service is one
of mutual accommodation, and the patrons are
expected to meet the department half way in
affording facilities for its establishment.
It does not necessarily follow that a
postoffles i need be discontinued because
the â¢ rural free delivery route passes by
such office, but if it does, it generally re
duces the receipts of the office to such an
extent that sooner or later it Is discon
tinued for lack of patronage. - People
.will not travel any great distance to re
ceive mall from the postofflce when it can
be delivered at their door. It generally
takes frofn sixty to ninety days from the
time the petition 1* pent In till the route
asked for is established. Much depends
on tho amount of business on "hand. The
petitions are taken up in the order of fll
ingr. except E in cases where taken out of
order by special- request of Senators or

e QUESTION OF DATES.
OUR esteemed contemporary the New -York
Times directs attention to the fact that if we
are going to be accurate in the matter of
c'ates we must celebrate Washington's birthday dur
ing this century on February 24 instead of February
Â¦22. The argument is that in this century the differ
ence between the Gregorian calendar and the Julian
calendar amounts to thirteen days, and since Washing
ton was born February 11, old style, in 1732, the anni
versary of his birth falls on the 24th.
The Cause of the shifting of the date is that in the
Gregorian calendar the leap year intercalation is
omitted three times in every 400 years, while there
was no such omission provided in the Julian sys
tem. When Gregory established his calendar in thf.
sixteenth century there was a difference of ten days
between the new style and the old. The year 1700 was
a leap year in the Julian calendar, but a common year
in the. Gregorian, so in' the eighteenth century the
difference between the two was eleven days.. The same
combination occurred in iÂ§oo, and during the nine
teenth century the difference was twelve days, and
finally, as the year 1900 was not a leap year in pur
calendar but was a leap year in the old style, there. iÂ»
one more day to be added to the increasing divergence
between the two, and we have now the" thirteen re
ferred to. . -,--_-,--
The introduction of this subject affords an oppor
tunity for those who delighted in the controversy con
cerning the date of the beginning of the century to
have another lively lot of calculations and confu
sions over the question of the anniversaries of events
which took place before the adoption of the new cal
endar.
By way of avoiding the confusion and shifting datei
it has been suggested that we adopt a conventional
date for the celebration of the birthday of Washing
ton and make it the 226. of February, regardless of the
variation of time. The same thing could be done alio
with other anniversaries of the kind, such as the
birthday of Franklin, which isÂ» celebrated in some
States, the discovery of America"and the foundation
of our older colonial settlements. ; . - .. â¢ '
Unless a conventional fixed date be agreed upon
Americans : are'Jikely to see strange things ; in the far
distant future. Thus the Times says: "If we make
Washington's* birthday a movable feast to keep- pace
with the slow procession Â» of the true anniversary,, in
about, 17,300 years Washington's birthday! would fall
on the Fourth of July." ; â¢
What kind of a combination hoiiday'would that be?
The very -''intimation of it is liable to produce confu
sion and perplexity in the minds v of those .who find
pleasure in looking ahead. It is to be hoped the mat
ter will be promptly settled by the general observance
of February 22 as Washington's birthday. There are
times when old dates are better than fresh ones.
PUNISHMENT OF KIDNAPERS.
|T~\EGULARLY with the assembling of the Leg
k-/ islatures of the Eastern States there comes a
revival of "the question of the advisability oi
establishing the whipping-post as a means of punish
ment for certain crimes which in the estimation, of
some people are inadequately dealt with by either fine
or imprisonment That discussion is now going on
at a lively rate in the East owing to the fact that hn
Delaware, where the pillory and the whipping-poit
are used as punishment, there is an agitation to abol
ish them; while-in Connecticut, where they do not
exist, there is a movement-! to establish Â»the v whip'ping
pqst, if not the pillory..' .."Â¦- ' ' V; '
The question has had a new, interest added to it
this time by the suggestion that" whipping be used as
a part of the punishmenttproyided for kidnaping." As
was pointed out by The Call immediately after the
Cudahy kidnaping case in Omaha, the existing laws
do not adequately provide for the punishment of that
offense. 'In nearly every State efforts will be made
during the present session of the Legislature to rem
edy the defect, and consequently in the East that issue
has naturally become involved in the whipping-post
discussion.
Judge Baldwin of Connecticut has strongly advo
cated the adoption by that State of the whipping-post
as a punishment for kidnapers who carry off children
with the intent to extort.ransom, and in defending his
proposition is reported to have said: "What are the
objections to such a penalty? That it would be in
human? There is nothing inhuman in using reason
able severity to punish physical outrages. It is s.o T
ciety striking back at the man that gave the first blow.
It is the natural impulse of every man to meet force
by force. That it would be unChristian? For an in
dividual to right his own wrongs in such a way per
haps might be; but the duty of the state to punish
criminal wrongdoers with the heavy hand is nowhere
proclaimed more explicitly than in the New Testa
ment. That it would degrade the kidnaper? De
grade him from what? What is his station, now?
Who is lower, baser, meaner, than the scoundrel who
steals away a child to extort money for his ransom?
That it is going back 1 to the dark ages? For some
things we may well go there and get light." .
A sidelight. upon the question is thrown by reports
that the whipping-post in Delaware causes all the
criminals of that State who if convicted would be
subject to it to leave Delaware and live in Maryland.
The report has stirred up the Marylanders and they
%e now asking one another whether it would be bet
ter to aid the movement for suppressing the whipping
post in Delaware or to establish "one in Maryland, and
so drive the criminals over the border into Pennsyl
vania.
Whether the whipping-post be established or no*,
it is certain something should be done for the punish
ment of kidnapers. It is' not likely the Cudahy af
fair will stand long as an isolated case. The success
of the criminals in obtaining a large ransom and get
ting away will be sure to encourage others to imitate
the example, and as a consequence some fitting pun
ishment for the crime should be provided this winter
in every State where the Legislature is in session.

In this respect, however, we have a strong
rival In Germany. There are now thirty
three cities of the 100,000 class in Ger
many, and some of them, show most as
tonishing growth for the last five years.
Nuremberg, for example, is one of the

and Dortmund nearly 30 per cent; Frank

SOME time ago we said that it remained for
some voice of authority in Christendom to de
maiyl justice in China.
BISHOP POTTER'S VIEW.
It is gratifying that the Christian conscience has at
last found expressfon by an authority as respected as
Bishop Potter.
He declares that the cause of the trouble in Chim
criginated with the Christians and not with the p>
gans. It is true that he. does not specify the crime
that is the final cause of the causes that joined in pro
ducing the trouble. That crime was the forgery inter
polated in the treaty of i860 by a Christian mission
ary. We desire to repeat that the treaty clause per
mitting Christian missionaries to operate outside the
treaty ports and to enter and own compounds in the
interior was forged, and that the crime of forgery can
not find more flagrant expression than in the'sophis
tication of a treaty. That is the real cause of the spec
tacle of inhumanity that has appalled the thinking
world.
The student of physics knows that man endangers
his own existence by interfering too much with the
equilibrium of nature. Whether it is by the intro
duction of the water hyacinth in Louisiana, the rabbit
into Australia, the mongoose into Jamaica, the gipsy
moth into New England, or the draining of prairie
ponds in the Mississippi Valley, the deforestation of
the Sierras, or the washing down of mountains by
hydraulic mining, the disturbance of natural equili
brium brings loss and punishment.
In like manner the rude interference with conditions
in an old-established civilization like that of China
brings loss and punishment to those who interfere.
Why should we man-el that the Chinese resent com
mercial desecration of their sacred places and the vio
lation of their tombs?
The Christian world planned and carried out three
bloody crusades to rescue from the keeping of the
Saracen the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. And cen
turies later the Christian nations themselves grappled,
in the Crimean war, over the question of, exclusive
jurisdiction of the same place, which is the holy
ground of the Christian world. Ships bring in. loads
of loot, rich spoils, taken from Chinese owners. A
petty lawsuit in this State discloses theÂ»watch of the
Empress Dowager in the possession of an American.
We have' not been at war with China. No American
has the least shadow of moral or legal right to the
possession of a single penny's worth of Chinese prop
erty, as the spoil of a war that is not, and has never
been. . . . â¢ .
As the Bishop puts it, these acts are not a happy
translation to pagans of the basic principles of Chris
tianity. .
Our administration at Washington has striven, "often
in the face of unjust attack, for the application of
the principles of justice to a Chinese settlement. The
first indorsement of its efforts to that end is now
uttered from the right quarter. We hope that Bishop
Potter's example will be speedily followed by'others,
and that the churches will declare that forgery,
vengeance and slaughter, are not among the methods
of the church," used for advancement of the kingdom.
Not only in the United States should this be done,
but from England, France, Germany and Russia
should come from every Christian v pulpit and altar the
same declaration. These united voices should be so
certain in their sound that 'civil government, in the
nominally Christian rations, will hear it and heed it.
Those^nations-have destroyed. in China' hundreds of
millions in property, and for. ; blood atonement have
takeji . scores of lives for each; one ended by the Chi
nese. The standing crops inf great districts, inhab
ited by millions of Chinese, have been destroyed, and

AAYOR PHELAX has issued an invitation to
"citizens interested in suppressing or regu
lating betting on horse races" to attend a
meeting to be held this evening at the chambers of
the Board of Supervisors. In a communication to
the board announcing the meeting the Mayor stated
that he would bring before the meeting the petition
of the Supervisors requesting the Legislature of the
State to pass a law limiting the racing season /o thirty
days in each count}-. He added that his own course
in the matter would be determined by the action of
the Legislature, and closed by saying: "The Legis
lature is the only bod}' that can properly regulati
racing or betting and make such regulations effective.
and the object of the meeting called is to influence the
Legislature to pas<; remedial laws."
The purport of the statement to the Supervisors can
hardly be mistaken by anybody. The meeting is
called for the purpose of getting what will at least
appear to be a representative body of San Francisco
citizens to petition the Legislature to adopt a meas
ure which, while nominally restricting racing, will vir
tually be a step toward reopening Ingleside track for
j-amWinp purposes.
The scheme 'is an ingenious one. By getting men
to support a measure that upon its face restricts
racing, bookmaking tnd pool-Â«elling, he will obtain
what he can readily distort irito a consent to the re
vival of gambling at Ingleside.
There is no need of State legislation on this sub
ject so far as this city is concerned. Racing is per
missible here, but pool-selling and bookmaking are
not. The gambling practices that in the past brought
so much of wretchedness, ruin, crime and suicide
upon the community have been effectually stopped by
the existing ordinance. That ordinance should be
maintained and enforced; and no good citizen should
give sanction and support to any petition which by
implication can be construed as signifying a consent
that gambling at the track should be permitted again
in this city for thirty days or any other period in a
year.
In a matter of this kind nothing should be left to
chance. Protests against the reopening of Ingleside
track have been filed with the Supervise, s, but ttie
men who framed and adopted them should not be
content with that. T!icy should appear with, their
friends -:nd supporters at the Mayor's meeting.
Thry ::ould be there to protest in person against the
wrong that is threatened, and they should make the
protest emphatic and clear.
It may be accounted certain that if the Mayor can
get tke meeting to petition the Legislature to limit
racing to thirty days in each county, and to intimate
that the municipal ordinance is not satisfactory, that
petition will be used afterward as an evidence that the
people arc willing to eUow a thirty days' racing 'sea
son at Ingleside. The people, therefore, should be
on their guard. They should attend the Mayor's
meeting and be prepared to vote down any suggestion,
that hints at the renewal of the old crime breeding
practices.
The issue concerns nearly all classes of citizens.
Business men whose employes are tempted into the
commission of frauds by the track Ramblers, parents
whose sons are led astray by the insidious vice < and
whose daughters even arc not wholly safe from it, the
pastors of churches who know how much of sorrow
hrs been caused smong families by this curseâ and
in short, all men who stand for morality and virtue
should attend the Mayor's meeting and make it an
overwhelming demonstration against track gambling.
The day has come when men must 'stand forth to be
counted on the right side. Never mind what may
have been the Mayor's motive in calling the meeting.
Attend it and vote down any and every proposition
that even intimates- the reopening of Ingleside track
for nÂ«>*J-*Â«llinar unA. booUmalcine.

THE biennial visitation of State institutions by
legislative committees is now in progress and
the important work of providing for them will
soon be taken up in both houses. â¢ '
There is a condition of anxiety in the State Uni
versity which we hope will soon be relieved. What
ever way of relief the Legislature may adopt should
be acted upon promptly. After the money now needed
is appropriated, as sppears to be likely, in l a lump
sum, there will be ample opportunity to study ways
and means for the' future. We think it will be found
worth while to study a change in our laws of incor
poration. New Jersey derives an income of over
two millions from a sliding scale charge on articles
"of incorporation. The charge runs in proportion to
the capital incorporated. Here the charge is uniform
at $5, and that fee goes to the State Library, produc
ing about $10,000 a year. Incorporation is a privilege
to capital for which it is willing to pay, as is proved
in New Jersey. To an inheritance tax on realty there
are some rational objections. The realty has paid its
taxes and borne its share of the public burden during
the lifetime of its cwner, and there may well be ques
tion of the right to burden it further on its passage
From the estate of the dead to that of .the living. No
such objection can be made to a corporation tax. The
law is liberal to the formation of corporations, and
they get valuable rights under it, for which they may
well pay, to support the university.
With more experience and a more deliberate dis
cussion between the university and the Governor u
plan may be ready for the next Legislature which will
relieve the institution of the necessity of lobbying at
every session for an appropriation to keep it running.
The State looks to the Legislature for a fair legis
lative and Congressional apportionment.- We hear of
the intrusion of personal and local ambitions into this
question. As it is a matter of law and figures, and
by their application justice is easily done, there should
be no greed, personal or local, in the matter.
The Republican party can better afford than ever
before to abstain from any gerrymander. Political
lightning in California is notoriously fickle, and Hie
history of the past proves that device and artifice have
never succeeded in holding on to power for the bene
fit of the party which employs them.
Let the whole people be considered, and their con
venience and interests served, by a natural apportion
ment, and the party will have deserved their favor
by doing its duty. To deserve public approbation is
better than to seduce it by artifice, or secure it by
indirection.
This State is just entering upon a new era and a
larger life. It is shedding and putting away many
methods that are obsolete, and looks with as much
hope to the future as it looks with pride upon the
past. It feels new energies, pulsates with resources
newly found, and has less patience with that which is
petty than ever before in its history. As it feels these
fiesh impulses it finds itself controlled by the Repub
lican party. Its government is the armor in which i*
advances to conquest its hopeful future. That armor
should be ample, and of pattern generous. Let tho.v:
who have in charge the party destiny make it part of
the State's destiny, by living up to the full measure,
of responsibility and opportunity.

H. D. Loveland's proposition for the or
ganization of a freight bureau in this city
to keep track of all freight rates for the
information of the business community
and also to take up matters in which
freights and transportation problems are
concerned, bids fair to result in a meeting
of prominent business - m^n representing
all lines of trade and manufactures in the
city. .Many merchants eay that'' the
wonder is that the city has not already
something of the sort. There has been
emergencies when transportation lines to
the north of San Francisco have managed
to get away a large share of the jobbing
trade from San Francisco In their â¢ imme
diate territory. An organization of the
merchants and manufacturers would have
been able, so the merchants say, to have;'
saved much. that has been lost.
. Mr. Loveland said last evening that' he
had already talked with leading men since
an interview with him appeared in The
Call on Sunday morning and they were
favorable to the idea. . The merits of an
organization competent to deal with' mat
ters that no single firm can cope with
separately was so obvious that he did not
nave to explain them to. any one. Other
cities have freight bureaus and they have
been I of . great benefit to those communi
ties. They were in a position to know all
that was going on and were in touch with
the business men and the transportation
lines also.' Mr.~ Loveland said that -if he
found a sufficient number of the business
men of the city in favor, of the establish
ment of a freight bureau in this city he
wouldcalla meeting to take the matter
up and see what could, be done.

XXXVm.â HOW TO PARAGRAPH
A' TYPEWRITTEN LETTER. .
The general rule for forming the pos
sessive Is to add an apostrophe and "s"
Cs)- The boy's hat; the children's play
ground: the lady's dress; DIckens's nov
els; Burns's birthplace.
Tho addins of the "s" in the last two
illustrations is wholly a matter of taste.
When tho additional syllable makes an
unpleasant sound tt Is customary to drop
the "a" and indicate the possessive by
the apostrophe alone. Note the following:
The ladles' waiting-room; the boys' play
ground. - , : - ;'Â¦ ' â¢'..
The apostrophe and s are always aoa
ed to the complete word. The complete
word in the first of the foregoing Illus
trations is ladies; not ladle: and in the
second, boys, not boy. The extra "a" is
dropped in each Instance because of tne
fact that it would be unpleasant to the
ear to sound it.
In names, such as "the Mechanics
Bank," there should be no apostrophe.
The name "Mechanics" is simply part of
the complete name of the bank and does
not denote possession in any sense.

Wat?r Front Notes.
This is Mr. Curr's first visit to th.Â»
coast, and before leaving for San Fran
cisco he visited every shipyard in the
Eastern States. Mr. Curr says that tho
shipbuilding tooli for the new Risdon
shipyard are ahead of anything he has
eeen.
For some years he was manager of th<?
Globe Shipbuilding Company on the Great
Lakes, and latterly has been in charge of
a.i of the steamers controlled by th3
Rockefeller interests. He is practical, in
dustrious and ambitious, a first-class na
val architect and practical shipbuilder at
the same time.
One of the few men with an internation
al reputation as a shipbuilder arrived from
the East yesterday. "Xears ago he was
employed by Harlan & Wolff, the famous
shipbuilders of Belfast. Ireland, and later
inducements brought him to the Great
Lakes. Now he comes fo California to su
perintend one of the greatest shipbuilding
plants ever Installed on this coast.
Robert Curr. the new superintendent for
the Risdon Iron Work3" shipyard. Is the
man. He is well known among shipbuild
ers and shipowners on the lakes , on ac
count of the large amount of work in
trusted to him by shipowners and under
writers, looking after their interests in
the construction and repair of steel ves
i selss. - : . :**.'?:
The Marin shore is the great attraction
for the fishermen theso days. - The her
ring is making for the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers via Raccoon Straits
and the fishermen's nets cannot contain
all that come in on the tide. Nearly two
hundred boats are always at work be
tween Sausalito and California city and
some of the catches are phenomenal.
Boatload after boatload of the succulent
"salochi" Is unloaded at fisherman's
wharf and the canneries are now in full
swing. The whiles are following the
pprats and "whale stories" are again in
order.
The Eisdon in Luck. i,
The Curacao arrived from Mexican ports
yesterday, and the Mexico Is scheduled to
arrive to-morrow. Both vessels have been
running opposition and a bitter warfare
has been waged. The Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company .finally cut the rates in half
and the owners of the Mexico could not
call the hand. In consequence the Mexico
will lie up for a few weeks, and as soon
as the rates go up on the Curacao she
will go back on the run. Then when rates
are again cut she will lie up once more.
There is going to be lots of fun on the
Mexican run for months to come. Both
vessels have plenty of backing and the
chances are that the war will be a long
drawn out one.
Millions of Herring.
Opposition Will Cease.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
stock went up a point and a quarter yes
terday. This in spite of the fact that the
San Jose, San Juan, San Bias and City of
Panama are laid up and the Barracouta
and Costa Rica are coming here from Cen
tral America to take a rest. /The Mail
Company is at outs with the Panama
Railroad Company, and that concern is
running its own steamers, thus necessi
tating the withdrawal of six of the Mail
Company's fleqt. It Is said that all the
steamers named will be in operation again
next month, and New York freights will
be carried across the continent by an
other route, of which Guaymas will be the
Pacific Coast terminal. In spite of the
fact that six steamers are tied up, how
ever. Pacific Mall stock went up $1 25 a
share yesterday.

"There was plenty of whisky and con
siderable blood in the boat," said the cap
tain yesterday. "There was a piece of a
bloody shirt lying in the bottom of the
Whitehall which looked to have been torn
from somebody's back In a row. We took
the boat in tow and she is now at Tiburon
awaiting an owner. We do not know who
owns her, but I think some of the boys
along the water front will report a boat
missing to-day. It looks to me as though
somebody had gone out fishing and left
the boat insecurely fastened. She then
drifted away. The blood may be fish
blood, but there were no fish in the boat.
If there was a row then the rest of the
story is yet to be told."
and part of a bloody shirt, and
with blood stain3 on the thwarts and other
signs of. a struggle, was picked up by the
ferry steamer Tiburon yesterday. Captain
White of the ferry, steamer has no theory
to advance about the abandoned boat, but
whoever can prove ownership can have
her on application at the Tiburon ferry.
The Tiburon left here on her usual
morning run yesterday, and when ' just
north of Alcatraz the derelict Whitehall
was sighted. Captain White at once
stopped the ferry steamer and ordered one
of the lifeboats cleared away.

1. Make one paragraph, of the introduc

2. Make one paragraph of the entire sub

have two or more subjects, that is to say,
if it- should start, for Instance, with a
complaint about the quality of a cose of

a discussion of the wisdom of starting ,i

XXXDC.-HOW TO RECKON COM-
MISSION.
Produce bought in Quantities or sent to
cities for sale is usually bought or soM
through commission merchants or brok
ers. Commission merchants usually hava
the goods consigned to them and sell
them in their own name. For this servico
they charge a fixed rate of commission.
Brokers do not usually receive the goods,
but sell for their customers and allow the
goods to be shipped direct to the buyer.
They also buy for their customers. Their
charge for this service is called broker
age. Commission and brokerage are recK
oned at a certain rata per cent on th<j
amount of money actually handledâ that
is, of the amount paid in buying or real
ized in selling. The rate is often a charga
by the bushel, or pound, or ton. as tt:#Â»
case may be. rather than at a fixed per
cent.' The exercises given here refer par
ticularly to commission merchants and
brokers who deal in produce and other
merchandise.

Note â In general the arithmetic of taxes
is the same throughout the country, al
though the methods of "striking rates"
and making collections differ considerably
in different States and cities. . ,
Property, including land, buildings,
manufacturing plants and in some in
stances personal effects, is valued by a
board of assessors and upon this assessed
valuation a certain rate of taxation is
fixed. The rate U always a per cent of
the valuation, but â¢ it is generally ex
pressed in mills on the dollar or in dollars
on each $100 or on each $1000. A ratÂ© of 12
mills on the dollar is equal to a rate of
$1 20 on each $100 or a rate of $12 on each
$1000. The rate of taxation is found by di
viding the amount to be raised by the
total valuation. For instance, if the total
assessment of a city is $37,500,000 and the
amount of money needed for a particular
year is $487,500 the rate of taxation is
found by dividing as follows:
4S7.500
â¢ 37,500,00p=$0.013 on the dollar.
The rate of taxation is, therefore, 13
mills on each dollar, or $1 30 on each $100
or. 113 on each $1000.. If a man has a house
and lot assessed for $3000 his taxes will
be 3X13, or $39.
Tax collectors find it to their advantage
to prepare a table similar to that shown
in the accompanying illustration. Tna
student will note carefully how the table
is made. The rate of 12^ mills on the dol
lar is expressed by thÂ« decimal .0125 placed
under the figure 1 in the second column.
In the third column we have twice this
amount, in the fourth three times this
amount and so on to the extreme right.
Running down the left column we have
ten times .0125, or .1250, following the 1:
twenty times .0125. or .2500. following the
2; thirty times .0125. or .3750, following tho
3 and bo on. The tax on $7 is .0875
or -08Â»i: that is. 8% cents. The tax
on $70 (found in the first perpendicu
lar column) is .8750. or 87%; that is.
8J% cents. Now suppose we desire to

New York Cotton Market.
NEW TORK, Jan. . 28.â The fluctuations of
the January cotton option were far more vio
lent'than, ever before known. ; reaching a mat
ter of 255 points, amid Intense - excitement,
though singularly small trading. Shorts were
crazed in the first hour by sensational reports
of 15c being the price at which over-sold Jan
uary oi>erators were to be allowed to "settle"
and by claims. that the clique. would possibly
refuse to settle at all until the last moment.
March and May followed, but failed to de
velop abnormal strength. . The English market
steadied considerably in keeping with our early
display of pronounced strength, but closed â¢ in
a non-committal sort of spirit ! with the Eu
ropean trade generally to us for In
centive. The private reports from* the South
declared that New York shorts had in several
Instances ordered cotton shipped at once by
express, the belief being that. a considerable
amount might yet be brought through In time
for delivery on contract. At the close the mar
ket was quiet and steady with. January net
S5. points ; higher and - other: months 1 point
higher to 3 points lower. During the rest of
the afternoon the cotton Â¦ market ruled quiet.
January closed at 11.05c, a -net' advance of S5
points for the day. and the -other months 1
polct higher to 3 point* lower. In accordance
with the advance in January spot cotton sold
at 12c, an advance of l%c for the day. '
NEW TORK. Jen. 2S.â The huge proportions
of the dealings In St. Paul made It the domi
nant fatter in to-day's market. Its influence
Â¦Â»Â¦Â£Â« marked on a very few stocks nearly
affiliated with it. and the general list showed
a dragging tendency, but on the upward and
downward course. The violent and erratic
novem?r.t in St. Paul kept the market con
fused and unsettled for the greater part of
the day. Tliere were considerable gains estab
lished during the eaily dealings, and. later in
the day prices fell considerably b?low Satur
day'E lexel, Lut the net changes are for the
nioat :dii small and some Kains are mixed
with the preponderant losses. St. Paul was at
one time nearly 3 point* above Saturday and
at another time over 2 points below. It closed
the day with a net lose cf IK un sales of 2L2.-
COu shares. The intermediate movement* were
excessively erratic and feverish. A very no
ticeable leature of the trading in the stocks
way the much heavier volume of transactions
on the advance than on the decline. Very
heavy offerings had to be taken, in fact, before
the advance wm inaugurated, the price run
ning eff a point from the opening under the
crushing weight of the offerings and very
heavy blocks being taken at each stage of the
adv&nce. When the price had touched 15SH
the buying demand received an abrupt check
and was not at any time afterward equal to
thit of the first hour, although there were
considerable revivals cf demand from^ time to
time. On the downgrade from 15&H to 152H
the offerinirs did not appear to be of over
whelming volume, but there was not suffi
cient demand to absorb them. The tipsters
this morning put out statements In great de
tail of the completed plan for the transfer of
Et. Paul stock in exchange for bonds of the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific It was
further announced that the plan would bs of
ficially published to-day. Up to the close of
business the promised plan had not been pub
lished, and this was all the news of the I day
bearing on the stock. The movement of fit.
, Paul was sirorilemented by a strong rise in
Kaneae and Texas preferred and in 'Manhat
tan. The first irregularity of the market was
caueed by weakness in the steel group, in
which the openir.c pains had been moderate.
The session of the directors of the American
Wire and Steel Company focused the atten
tion of (peculators In that group. No decis
ion - was announced on the dividend question
before the market closed, but the stock, after
exiling down to 3S X Â«, had a rally to 41 in the
final dtalingF. The other steel stocks which
had weakened in sympathy, notably Federal
Steel, did not have time to respend before the
close. There was a sudden etiffening of South
ern Pacific in the final dealings atao. but the
clof'.ng generally was heavy and dull. London
was a fmall seller, but the further advance in
sterling exchange made It evident that the
homeward movement of securities continued
very hÂ«-avy.
Business In railroad bonds continued large
&nr prices advanced in the early dealings, but
yielded in sympathy with stocks. Total sales.
JI.KX.OOO. United States bonds were all un
chai;ced.

Corn No. 2 â
Corn felt the wheat weakness, as well as
freer country offerings. Near the end of the
session rumors of cash inquiry caused covering
by shorts and the market reacted. May closed
%c lower.
Oats were quiet and steady. Independently of
otrtr markets. May sold between 25^@25Uc.
and closed a shade lower at 25U@25%c.
Provisions opened higher In sympathy with
an advance in hogs and held steady on local
buying. May .pork closed 12%c higher; May
lard 5@7%c higher and May ribs a shade im
proved.
The leading futures ranged as I follows:
CHICAGO. Ijan. 2S.â May wheat opened %Â©lc
lower at 77@76Hc. Offerings were liberal under
the influence of lower cables which camejin
the face of the advance here Saturday.- world's
shipments which, with Australia to hear from,
aggregated 7,262,000 bushels, and an increase of
C32.0CO bushels In the amount of wheat and flour
on ocean passage. Following the opening the
market recovered to 77c on moderate buying
by commission houses. This demand did not
last long and selling by longs caused a drop
during the forenoon to 76Uc, heavy primary
receipts being the chief factor. A decrease In
the visible of 405.000 bushels caused a mo
mentary rally to 76Hc, but it was not sup
ported, and May. went down again to 76c and
closed weak 1%&U4c lower at 76>4S76U<*. The
market was largely' a professional one with
the outside little interested.

A ship's losr la arulnstrument for meas

Ing and consists of three parts, viz.. the
logchip, the logllne and the log-glass. The
principle is simply this:
A light substance thrown from the ves
sel ceas-es to partake of the motion of the*
vessel as soon as it strikes the water ajid
will be left behind on the surface after a
certain Interval. . It the distance of the
ship front this stationary object be meas
ured the approximate rate of sailing will
be given.
The logchlp Is the float, the lopHne la \
the measure of the distance, and the log
glass defines the Interval of thne.
In the old days the heaving of the lo^
required skill and watchfulness, but since
the patent log has come into use no skill *
is required in finding the speed of a ves
sel. It is regulated by clockwork and the
number of knots the vessel sails per hour
Is recorded on the dial without any hand

CLOSING
The stock market here was ' narrow but firm
to-day. American shares were fairly active
until about 2 o'clock, when on early orders
from New York there was a sharp rally. This
was particularly true of Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul and Louisville and Nashville.
After that rally the American department
weakened and clOBlng heavy broke sharply in
the street. Money rates were shifter and the
market finally was borrowing from the bank
at 5 J .i per cent for four days.

DISCLOSE THE STORY

' OAKLAND. Jan. 28.â After a year of se

ded away from home, and returned after
ward to their respective residences. The
groom resides at 1765 Grove street. Mrs.
Quieley is the daughter of Thomas
Howie, a millwright, residing on Syca

of the marriage only a few days ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢Â».... HIS Broadway. Jan. 23.
"When the case of Contractor John
Worthlngton against the City Auditor wa3
Submitted to Judge Hall this afternoon
the court announced that on account or
the far-reaching significance of the suit
he would withhold his decision until: he
had examined the authorities- cited by
counsel on both sides.
"Worthlngton's attorney In his opening
argument last week attacked the validity
of the State eight-hour law, under which
the labor unions pfotested the payment of
Worthington's claim on the city treasury.
The unions, which are making the defense,
although the suit Is nominally against the
city, retained Attorney J. E. McElroy to
conduct their case, with State Commis
sioner of Labor F. V. Meyers as associate
counsel. *
Meyers- and McElroy directed their ar
guments to the constitutionality of the
eight-hour law and its application to the
present instance.
It was urged that a State or city has
the same right, under the constitution to
employ labor as the Individual, has, he'nc*
may say for what hours Us employes shall
work. Decisions of Federal and State Su
preme Courts were cited in support of
this principle. It was further contended
by the defense that this law applies to all
municipalities whose charters do not ex
pressly delegate the power of regulating
hours of labor to the city government
It was shown tnat the charter granted
to the city of Oakland contains no such
provision, and counsel argued that there
fore the general law- controlled the city in
that respect.
In reply to the argument of the plain
tiff's attorney that the Auditor had ex
ceeded â¢ his prerogatives in rejecting
"TOorthlngton's claim, McElroy said that
all city officials were call#d upon to ex
ercise .their Judgment as to whether a
claim was just or not. and that as the
general law provided for a forfeiture on
the amount of a contract It was the duty
of the Auditor to withhold the amount of
tne forfeiture. . â¢ -
The principle contention of the hearing
has related to the exercise of this func
tion by the City Auditor, the plaintiff
claiming that It was a Judicial function,
hence unconstitutional.
â¢ Judge Hall Bald that apparently the
State Supreme Court had ruled that a
city official had no right to determine
what portion of a claim should be held
out, but- that If such were the case he
should refuse to follow the ruling, as it
appeared td him Invalid. His Honor said
that it was the obvious. duty of a city of
ficer to protect the city's interests. Should
a contest arise, .he said, the dissatisfied
party could always have recourse to the
courts. â¢ ... .

Alleged Failure to Offer

OAKLAKD, Jan. 28.â Cupid, with a
twentieth century hustle, caught
a couple of victims last week at
Haywards In record-breaking
time. Four days after- Miss Fran-,
ces Kelly, a plump and pretty young
waitress from San Francisco, arrived a-.
the Villa Hotel she was the betrothed of
Frank N. Jersey, head clerk of the Hay
wards hostelry. The next day there was
a wedding in the hotel parlors and all of
Haywards enjoyed the festivities that fol
lowed the romantic courtship and mar
riage.
It was the old story of love at first
Bight. Miss Kelly did not have to make
goo-goo eyes to win the handsome clenc.
In fact he says he just tumbled head over
heels in love as soon . as he caught a
glimpse of the new arrival from the city.
Indeed Miss Kelly was hardly Installed
in, her position before her admirer lost no
opportuntly to throw himself in the way
of his bright eyed enchantress.
Mine host, D. G. Frnntz, observed that
his clerk was mentally disturbed and
pressed the young man for an explana
tion. Jersey confided to the genial land-

that the little love-god had shattered hts
heart and that the girl from Ban Francls
co only could rehabilitate it.
Frantz was willing to relieve tho love
lorn clerk and did not place any obstacles
in the way of the couple meeting. So Jer
sey, with a clear Held, went after the
prize. Within four days they were en
gaged. Frantz and his wife were at once
informed.
"'Now you've won her, ray boy," Bald
the landlord. "Don't lose any time."
Miss Kelly was consulted. Nothing loth,
she consented to the plan, so the fifth day
of the acquaintance was fixed upon for
the wedding.
Wednesday evening at 9 o'clock the
guests at the Villa were bidden to the
marriage feast. Rev. Father Lally offl
elated.' Miss Barbara Frates was the
bridesmaid and Victor La Grave acted as

Indian to the effect that a meeting of that
ration had decided to destroy the prop

the exception of the Choctaw, Oklahoma
and Gu'.f and Santa FÂ« roads.
In a letter dated Muskogee. January 2G,
to General Solicitor James Hagerman, Mr.

"Last night United Etates Marshal Ben
nett ar.d Indian Agent Schoenfeldt inter
viewed a Choctaw, who pledged them to
keep his name secret, but who was anx
ious to place what Information he pos
pesped in the hands of Government offi
cials. He *aid there has been a. meeting
of full-blood Choctaws. In which the
cturse to be purpued- by them had been
determined. Among v other things it was
decided to run ail white- men out of
the nation. Only two railroads in the
Choctaw Nation, which had a right to be
constructed under the treaty of 1SG3. upon
which rbe full-b!oods claim to stand, are
the Choctaw. Oklahoma and Gulf Rail
road and the St. Louis and San Francisco
Railroad. They decided, therefore, to de
stroy the Missouri. Kansas and Texas
road. Six hundred light horsemen took
oath that they would at an appointed
time attack different parts of the Mis
souri. Kancas and Texas tracks and burn
bridges and trestles, liennett and Schoen
i'vit believe that this plan will be car
ried out within the next ten days. These
gentlemen believe that there is more dan
per in the valley of the Canadian River
and advise every possible precaution be
ing taken by the road."

mony of O'Connor, the
Bellboy.
Butcher Who Formerly Sold Meat to
Hot?l Says He Heard Trew
hella Threaten to Kill
Glaze.
Contrary to expectation the defense In
the ra*e of Robert "E. Glaze, charged with
the murder of his partner. William Trew
holta. at the Windsor Hotel, on the 14th
inst., commenced yesterday morning to
put witnesses on the stand in Judge Con
lan's court and it it intended to submit
the whole of the testimony In behalf of
the defendant. Tho first object was to
discredit the testimony of John H. O'Con
nor, the bellboy, and the second to show
by witnesses that Trewhella had threat
ened to kill Glare as far back as last Sep
tember.
O'Connor was called yesterday morning
tOT further cross-examination by Attor
:iew W. \V. Foote. O'Connor denied that
he had f=a1d to Mrs. Glaze in the presence
of !i?r daughter Mabel that he had not
fern anything of the shooting. Neither
did he recollect saying- anything of the
klr.d to a Mr. Lawton. He was so fright
emÂ«d at the time that he did not know
really what he did say.
Kr>r the defense John S. Law-ton, a guest
at the Windsor, testltled that Fhortly
aftrr the shooting he had asked O'Connor
If he knew anything about It and O'Con
nor had replied that he did not. Christo
pher Merchant, butcher at 25 Sixth street,
u!sr> testified that he had asked O'Connor
Â¦ similar question and had received tne
same rt>p!y. He had conversations Â¦with
Trewhe'la in September and December
and Trewhclla said that he would, have to
pell out to avoid trouble. Merchant ,sup
jtiied meat to the hotel..
Samuel Mayers, a former partner of
Merchant in the butcher business, test' â¢
tied that about last Admission day he was
at the Windsor and Trewhella came to
him and said: "You have trouble with
your partner Rnd 1 have trouble with
mine. Unless 1 get ray money out of the
, I will kill him." He told Glaze
what Trewhella had paid. He had visited
O!ozÂ«? in the City Prison, he said on cross
fxair.ination.
Royden Porter, an ex-employe at the
"Windsor, testified that he was in the bar
room January 14 and heard five phots. Ke
ran downstairs and met O'Connor com
ing from the kitchen toward the office.
He had two or three conversations with
O'Connor about the Ehootlng and O'Con
nor had voluntarily told him he knew
nothing about it.
During cross-examination Porter said he
eaw Glaie coming from the kitchen with
a revolver in his hand. O'Connor was in
the door of the kitchen and Trewhella's
bofly was about six inches from the door.
This corroborated O'Connor's testimony.
Silas Hatch of Nebraska, who had been
employed by O'Connor to act as bellboy
In November and In the beginning of this
month, testified that on January 6 he
heard Glaze say to Trewhella: "What Is
the use of your threatening me? I al
Â¦vvaysÂ» treated you on the square." In No
vember he also saw them, talking in the
courtyard.
AtTorr.ey Foote said that he had about a
dozi-n other witnesses. Including the de
fendant and his wife, but a? he had to go
to Sacramento he asked for a continuance

This oil pool covers several hundred
acres of . water and is a favorite harbor
of- refuge for coast craft in time of storm-
It is the accepted theory that the oil
comes from the bed of the gulf, and thÂ«s
company now being organized proposes
to put down wells if any anchorage can
be secured for the well-drilling machinery.
The company will have a capital stock of
1500,000.

AUSTIX, Tex., Jan. 23.â The oil excite
ment is increasing throughout. Texas. It
is conservatively estimated by ' those
who have been keeping in close touch with
the movement that fully 5,000,000 acres of
prospective oil lands have been leased In
different parts of the State since the great
gusher near Beaumont was discovered
several days ago. The demand for well
drilling rigs is unprecedented. Scores of
these outfits are being shipped into the
State from Pennsylvania and Indiana.
There has been a big Jump In land values
In numerous prospective oil districts.
Thomas Harpley, a wealthy rice grower
of Louisiana, was here to-day on business
in connection with the organization of a
company /which proposes to put down oil
wells in the Gulf of Mexico about forty
flvo miles from Galveston. The proposed
site of these wells Is known to mariners
as "Oil Pool." from the fact that the sur
face of the gulf at that pofnt is covered
with oil.

EEAI ESTATE TBAUSACTIONS.
NEW "YTJRK. Jan. 2S-â Justice Beach In
the Supreme Court to-day handed down
a decision continuing the temporary in
junction restraining George J. Gould. Ed
win Gould, Howard Gould and Helen
Gould, as trustees of the estate of their
father, from paying over the Income of
the portion of the estate belonging to their
sister, Anna Gould, Countess de Castel-
Iane, pending the trial of an action
brought by Asher Werthelmer, a London
bric-a-brac dealer, against the Count and
Countess de Castellane for J318.000 for
paintings and bric-a-brac furnished them.
Judge Beach permits the payment of
$200,000 a year to the Countess for the sup
port of herself and children, pending the
trial of the action..
Judge. Beach in hi3 decision said the
objection of . trustees to. the court's juris
diction was not well tajcen, and concluded:
"The fifth clause of the first codicil In
the will of Jay Gould provides that the
income from the trust fund shall not be
liable in the hands of the executors and
trustees for any debt or liautilty of the
beneficiary (the Countess de Castellane).
"This declaration has -no protective
power in this State, although in some
others it has been held effective.
"The real ground upon which such es
tates have been declared alienable and
liable for debts is that inalienable rights
of property are opposed to the fundamen
tal principles of the common law, and
that It is against safety that a man should
have an estate to live on but not an es
tate- to pay debts with â that he should
have the benefits of wealth without the
responsibility. . â¢ \..i
"Unless the injunction and action are
upheld the plaintiff and his assignor
(Wertheimer) despoiled of their property
will be absolutely remediless, with noth
ing left but the broken promises and th<3
commercial dishonor of their debtors." â¢
Judge Beach Holds It Is th.e Only
Method for Protecting the
Creditors of the Â¦
Count.
Injunction Against Gould
Trustees Is Con
tinued. \
BONI'S INCOME
IS CUT DOWN
Armour Institute, tlie Pet Project of
the Late Millionaire Packer, Is
Not Mentioned in th.8
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â The .will of the late
millionaire packer and grain dealer, Philip
"D. Armour, disposes of an estate valued
at $15,000,000, according to statements made
in an application for l'ctters testamentary
filed In the Probate, Court here to-day by
Malvina' B. Armour, widow of deceased,
and J. Ogden Armour, his son. Mrs. Ar
mour and. J. Ogden. Armour are made ex
ecutrix and executor and are named as
legatees, each receiving one-half of the
estate. -
Of the testator's wealth $14,900,000 is In
personal property and $100,000 In realty.
P. D. Armour and Lester Armour, grand
sons by his- sob P. D. Armour Jr., who
died in - California a year airo, are not
made legatees directly in the will, but are
provided for handsomeiy by "charges on
the legatees." . . It - is urovided in these
"charges" that upon attaining the age of
25 years each of the grandchildren shall
receive, $1,000,000, half of this from Malvlna
B. Armour, their grandmother, and half
from J. Osrden Armour, their uncle.. At
30 years of p.ge each is to receive a similar
amount from grandmother and â¢ uncle.
Should they live to attain the ages men
tioned, each will, therefore, receive an
aggregate of $2,000,000 from the estate. -As
a reason for not leaving- his grandchildren
more, the writer of the will explains th-it
their father, during his life, had already
received nearly all of jiis share in the es
tate. To this the children and the>r
mother are heirs.
The executrix and executor are. given
full power to manage the estate without
bond. The instrument is dated Pasadena,
California, Januarv 30. 1900.
Armour Institute, Mr. Armour's pet
project, which he fostered with a lavish
hand during life, is not mentioned in the
will, but it is regarded as certain that
provision for it was made before its pa
tron died.
A codicil to-the will, under date of Pas
adena, California, February 12. 1900. pro
vides . that the -executrix and executor
shall not be responsible to any court for
their handling of the estate and otherwise i
emphasizes the entire independence of the
legatees in dealing â¢with the property
which falls from him to them. -
L. C. Krauthoff, an attorney long In the
service of -Mr. Armour, declared that Mr.
Armour Â¦ had made provision for the Ar
mour Institute before drawing his will at
Pasadena. In reference to the fact that
the will leaves nothing to charity, Mr.
Krauthoff said:
"Mr. Armour gave to charity during his
life rather than hold back the good It
would do until after his death. A day
never passed during his business career
that he did not give liberally to some
charity, and the aggregate of his gifts
of this character would mount well up
into the millions."

The Park Commissioners will be ap
pealed to by the automobilists of this city
for greater privileges. At a meeting of
the Automobile Club of California last
evening It was decided \o make every
effort to gain concessions for those who
operate the horselc33 carriage.
Mr. Johnson of New York attended the
meeting and enlightened the members
present on the manner In which the auto
mobilists of New York obtained certain
privileges In Central Park. He said they
went to the Park Commissioners one by
one and obtained permits to ride through
the park. He suggested that this plan
might be followed to advantage in this
city. The suggestion, however, was not
looked upon favorably. It was teemed
best to try some other plan to win over
the local Park Commissioners and the
members are racking their brains for a
plan that will be successful.
, At 'present automobiles are permitted
on the south drive of the park as far as
the main drive, a distance of about one
mile and a quarter. As this distance is
covered In eight minutes by the "autoa"
the devotees are anxious to obtain a
longer run. .... Â¦
The constitution and by-laws of the club
were read and adopted. Members of the
organization are divided into four classe3,
viz.: Honorary, active, non-resident and
life members.- .The active members pay
an entrance fee of >15 and $2 50 per month

BRIEF LOCAL NEWS.
The Duke lunched In -his apartments
yesterday afternoon. The waiter had just
arrived with the eatables when a caher
rapped on the door of hid Grace's room.
1 ell him I'm at lunch," commanded the
Duke, but the visitor didn't need to be
told, for just then somebody upset the
dishes and the would-be caller made a
hurried exit without waiting for the
Duke's message.
"But they won't let you ride fast here
In the United States." said the Duko, In
telling of his trip ldst evening. "Over In
England," he continued. "I got arrested
three times in one day for riding faster
than the law allows. Young Vanderbilt
isn't In It when I get started. "We had a
very pleasant ride. We went the length
of Van .Ness avenue. Say. but I would
like to ride your City Fathers over those
crossings In the avenue. Talk about your
canyons In the Yosemlte Valley! Why,
they are not to be compared with the gul
lies that we went over."
The Duchess' condition was much Im
proved last evening and her physician
says she will be able to go out to-day. A
ride in tho Park is planned, after which
the party may dine with Mr. and Mrs. E.
O. McCormicK. It is planned to go to
Monterey to-morrow, where a short stay
will be made, after which the party will
go direct to Chicago.
The Duke of Manchester and Lord
Lambert enjoyed an automobile ride yes
terday afternoon. The Duke is an expert
in .handling the steam variety of self
moving vehicles, having taken lessons In
England. He made the dust fly as the
vehicle bowled through the streets, dart
ing In and out of narrow passages, be
tween cars and trucks and swinging
around corners with a velocity that made
one's hair stand up..
The Duchess Is Much Better and the
Party Will Leave for Del

"How does any one know what God
means?" asked the speaker. "The* only
way Is to find out what he has permitted
to take place. Practically all the doctrin
aire business has been swept out of ex
istence. Perhapa the most Important dis
covery in the century is the reality of ex
ternal things. The only God is- the god
of things as they are. The -first lesson
that the child learnsâ that . the surround
ing things will hurt and that certain
things taste sweetâ is perhaps the last
lesson up to date of our civilization."
Professor Charles Mills Gayley of the
University of California discussed the
"Greatest Book of the Nineteenth Cen
tury." He took poetry as the . test and
paid attention to many great poets and
writers In very radical fashion. He found
Ruskln to be flabby; Tennyson was not :\
poet for men: Browning was a poet, but
could not write straight ahead; Byron
wrote froth and carried his heart on his
sleeve; Carlyle. Emerson, Harriet Beech
er Stowe, Balzac and Thackeray were net.
the best. Goethe took the first place in
Mr. Gayley'e ideas and his "Faust" was
the booK of the century.
The Rev. Charles Brown of Oakland
made a very eloquent talk, discussing the
"Greatest Man of the Nineteenth Cen
tury." He said that the greatest man
was the one who had exercised the great
est and most enduring influence on his
tory. Judging from this standpoint he
placed Abraham Lincoln at the head of
his list. Mr. Brown 'spoke so well that
he had the very unusual honor of a cur
tain call. After he had concluded the club
insisted on his standing up to be recog
nized again and then he had as many
cheers, hand clappings and handkerchief
wavings as a prinia donna on an opening
night of grand opera.
F. H. Wheelan discussed "The Greatest
Invention of the Nineteenth Century."
This he considered to be the discovery b;'
Bessemer of a cheap process of making
steel.
The Unitarian Club had a very Interest
ing time talking about the nineteenth cen
tury last evening in the banquet hall of
the Merchants' Club and discussing the
relative places to which the great men,
the great inventions and scientific dis
coveries of the century ought to be as
signed. President David Starr Jordan of
Stanford University after a few words of
introduction by Warren Gregory, presi
dent of the club, discussed the "Greatest
Scientific Discovery of the Nineteenth
Century."
President Jordan spoke of the discovery
of extinct animals by Cuvier, the discov
eries of Lyell In geology, the discovery
that all forces are one in different form,
the discovery of the utility of democracy
and to each gave high place. But the
greatest discovery, he said, was evolution.
The idea did not belong to the nineteenth
century, being very much older, but the
century had discovered its practical ap
plication; more Important was the coinci
dent discovery of how to apply the human
mind to research. There was no way to
settle anything by authority any more.
It used to be thought that some religion,
some church, some god, could tell some
easier way to get knowledge. Now there
was no authority except such as rested
upon investigation.'

When the Board of Supervisors met yes
terday afternoon there was little to Indi
cate that a matter of such public moment
as the licensing of crime on a mammoth
scale was likely to be considered at the
session. . Much less than a quorum of the
this crime upon the city the gamblers
found yesterday no sponsor for their or
dinance and their scheme. Supervisor
Tobin said that he did not intend to intro
duce such an ordinance and was not con
cerned In one.
They have already won a victory, but
cannot afford to rest upon it. In the face
of the tremendous public opinion opposing
that from some district of the city will
come an advocacy of the gambling and
the track thievery Mayor Phelan expects
to construe this advocacy Into the en
lightened public opinion of San Francisco.
Decent people in this city cannot afford to
be misrepresented in this matter. They
should go, therefore,. to the mass-meeting
to-night.
McCormick and Is Given
Encouragement.
A committee representing the Knights
of Pythias held a conference with Passen
ger Traffic Manager K. O. McCormick
yesterday afternoon relative to fixing spe
cial rates for the Pythlans' conclave to. be
held In this cijy next year. Mr. McCor
mick gave the committee every - encour

matter before the Transcontinental Pas

April. . .
A large number of special trains will be
run from Eastern points and between 10 â¢

McCormick assured the committee that
a fare as low as $50 for a round trip from

sented by President E. P. Ripley, Vice
President J. M. Barr and Land Agent
Chambers. Prior to the meeting Presi
dents Hays and Ripley were In conference
together In Mr. Hays' office for two hours
and lunched together.
The meeting at the Palace lasted until
nearly midnight. Vice President Stubbs
went home at 11 o'clock. He appeared
very much onended when asked tne pur
pose of the meeting.
"I consider it the neight of impertinence
for the newspapers to go nosing into the
affairs of a lew business men wno get to
gether for the discussion of matters that
in no way interest the public," He said.
President nays was less reticent.
"The meetiiiK," he saia, "was lor the
purpose or taitung over a number or. mat
ters iu wnicn boin roads nave a common
interest. Trie two roads are tnrown more
or less togetner every year in one way or
anotner, ana we sunpiy discussed pians

aeverai rate questions were ajso dis

Dy the Great Nortnern and Northern Pa
cillc came in for a enare ot comment. Tne
colonists' rates that have been announced
have not Ueen maae to onset any cut in
rates made by tne Northern Pacirtc. The
idea ot a colonials' rate was suggested by
tne passenger tramc managers 01 the sev
eral \\ estern lines some time ago, and
with tne approval of tne heads or the mr
terent roaus was. ordered put into eftect
at the last meeting of the Transconti

It Is the desire of both the Southern Pa
clrtc and. me Santa J?"e 10 encourage iu
every way possible colonization of tht
State, hence, if low farÂ»Â»s-wiil accomplish
the desired end, the railioads are reaay 10
lend a helping hand. These special rates
are made tor only one way, and once the
traveler is got into tne Â£>iate every
thing-possible will be done to keep him
here.
The alleged shortage of oitru"? fruit cars
was also aiscuasea and the fact wu.-t
1 brought out mat botn companies were
never better equipped to hanaie tne busi
ness than this year. The Southern Pacllic
has 3600 cars in use, while the Santa Fe
owns nearly as many, but has been ham
pered some by the coal strike.. The South
ern Pacific has loaned the Santa Fe peo
ple a number of cars. ,
It is understood that Senator Clark's
new road from Salt Lake City to LÂ»os An
geles will be the means of even closer re
lations between the Southern Pacific and
the Santa- Fe. It is a well-known fact
that both roads have given ' the matter
some attention of late and if the ClarK en
terprise turns out a reality, as it now
promises to be, it would not surprise the
railroad public to hear of a deal by which
the two Pacific Coast lines will be able
to compete more keenly with the Salt
Lake company.
Tt Is safe to say that one of the out
comes of last evening's â¢conference will be
closer relations between the two railroads,
all of which makes a combine of the two
lines less improbable in the near future.

SWEETLY SINGS
CELTIC BALLADS
Father McLoughlin Charms
Large Audience With
Musical Lecture.
Airs of Old Bards Rendered as iu
Olden Times to the Accompani
ment of Harp and
Chorus.
The Rev. Thomas P. McLoughlln de-
livered the second of his musical lectures
before a large audience at the Native
Sons' Hall last evening, and more than
duplicated the success he achieved on a
former occasion.
The lecture last night was for the bene
fit of the Catholic Seamen's Institute and
Father McLoughlln's fine voice trolled
out "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep"
with a special emphasis which brought
him an enthusiastic encore, for which he
save another nautical melody.
The stage last night was made bright
by the smart frocks of a chorus of
twenty-one young ladles, who gave the
lecture a piquant setting and lent the
charm of their united voices to the re
frains of the quaint old ballads Father
McLoughlin selected to illustrate the text
of his lecture.
Speaking of national ballad music he
dwelt on the minor chords so plentiful
in the folk songs of Ireland and Scot
land, and which give the Celtic airs such
a pathetic quality. The English ballad
music, he said, was of a more cheerful
kind and without the Indefinite melan
choly of Ireland's native airs. He sang
"The Harp That Once Through Tara's
Halls" ana "Scots Wha Hae," besides
many other characteristic melodies.
An overture on the piano was rendered
by Misses Eleanor Gehrig and Marie
Glorgiani, who also played the "Wearing
of the Green" with fine effect as an ac
companiment, to the lecturer. Of. Mrs.
John B. Casserly's 1 harp accompaniment
the audience were loud in praise. The
lecture ended wJth the singing of ."Auld
Lang Syne" by all present.

The Methodist Preachers' Meeting: of San Francisco, the organized assembly of Methodist Episcopal churches and
societies of this citv, and" a body of recognized influence, met yesterday and adopted resolutions emphatically denounc
ing the proposed attempt to revive track gambling in San B'rancisco. A committee A)f three clergymen was appointed

SAU" FRANCISCO, January 28, 1901.
WHEREAS, We, the San Francisco Methodist Preachers' Meeting, are reliably informed that a pro
posal is about to be made to you, the Honorable Board of Supervisors, 1 by the gamblers of this city asking
you to pass an ordinance reopening the race course at Inglesids and thus re-establish poolsslling against
the vote of the majority of the citizens of this city as expressed at the last election;
Therefore, in the name of the thousands of Christian and moral voters whom we represent, we en
treat you as our representatives to reject any such, measure which may be presented.

PUBLIC opinion won a signal vic
tory yesterday over the gamblers
v.ho arc sce-k;ng to use the BoarJ
of Supervisors as instruments
with which to reopen Ingleside
with its booknaJdng and poolselling. But
the- fight 5s not yet won. The decent peo
pie of San Francisco have simply secured
a temporary triumph and to-night they
must show their earnestness, their de
termination and untiring purpose not to
Â»:iow a mammoth criminal agency to be
established in this city.
To-night the decent people of San Fran
cisco roust go to the chambers of the
Board of Supervisors and show by their
rxeFence and their words that they are
emphatically opposed to. a revival of
crjm* and Rambling In this city. Mayor
Phe'.an inviies them to do so and places
upon them the grave responsibility of
having the ;>roceedings of the meeting to
nipht go furth as the sentiment, of the
reputable public of San Francisco. Mayor
Phelan declares that this meeting will tell
whether or not the people of this city
want booJcmaklng. pooltelling and a race
track or none of them.
It is the duty theiefore of every min
ister and clergyman who spoke to con
gregations which Â¦ aggregated thousands
of men and women on Sunday night to
go to the chambers of the Board of Su
pervisors to-night and speak for the peo
ple they represent in honest, upright life.
It if the duty of every merchant who
has been robbed by an employe through
the racotrack to be at this meeting. It
is the duty of every one who believes that
gambling, pocket-picking, dissipation and
crime should not be licensed in this city
to be at this meeting and voice his pro
test, for Mayor Phelan has not been fair
Mayor Phelan declares that he has been
i misrepresented. He does not tell by whom,
I but he certainly should invjte those who
j he believes misrepresented him. He ought
to know who they are if they exist, and he
ought to give them an opportunity to be
heard in reference to the alleged mlsrep-
Yet he demands that those whom he in
vites to be present shall represent intelli
gent public opinion in San Francisco. The
issue, therefor?. Is a critical one. which
the people of San Francisco cannot afford
to evade. Mayor Phelan has read the
stinging rebuke of his policy delivered
from pulpits In all parts of the city, still
by implication he declares that is not en
lightened public opinion. He has read the
denunciation by the press, and declares
that not to be enlightened public opinion.
It is a grave duty, therefore, since Mayor
Phelan has called a mass-meeting of the
people of the city to express enlightened
public opinion *jpon an issue of the great
est moment to the city, for the decent
people of San Francisco. In their own ca
pacity of by their leaders, to be repre
sented, or risk the serious danger of be
ing misrepresented.
Mayor Phelan has issued invitations to
certain people, and he arrogates A.he right
to declare that these people shall repre
sent the whole people of San Francisco.
Who these people are he will not tell. He
refused to do 33 yesterday on the ground
that he did not intend to give an advan
tage to what he is pleased to call "the
enemy." A representative of The Call
asked for the names of those whom he
intended to invite, and upon the ground
mentioned he refused to give them.
in his manner of calling a meeting which
he insists shall represent the public of
San Francisco.
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San Francisco-
Gentlemen: I have invited ministers and other
Interested citizens to meet in the chambers of
the Board of Supervisors to-morrow (Tuesday)
evening, at 8 o'clock, to discuss the matter of.
The last and only remaining official in
cident of the session of the board In ref
erence to track gambling was a message
from Mayor Phelan announcing that he
had decided to call a mass meeting for
to-night at 8 o'clock to discuss track
gambling" and give forth an enlightened
public opinion on the subject. The mes
sage in full is as Allows:^^^
Then came the resolutions which were
adopted unanimously yesterday morning

ordinance. One by one the absent mem
bers straggled in. the Mayor appeared and

Among the communications to the board

at the last meeting petitioned the Legislature
of the State to pass a law limiting thÂ« racing
season to thirty days Jn each- county, and T
â¢will bring the matter of that petition bÂ«forÂ«
the meeting. The influence of an enlightened
public opinion is necessary to bring the issue
fairly before the Legislature.
As there have been misrepresentations made
I desire to Inform the Board of Supervisors
that the only position that I have taken on
this question, either publicly or privately. Is
that the racing eeason should be limited by the
Legislature and that poolselllns and booJcmaJt
lng be prohibited, as is done Ja the State if
New York. The action of the Legislature,
however, must determine my future course In
the premises, aa the city of San Francisco hns
no Jurisdiction outside of its own limits, but
its. citizens are the patrons of the racetracks,
both in Oaklantl and San Mateo.
The Legislature, therefore. Is the on:y body
that can properly regulate raclnff and betting

object of the meeting called Is to Influence
the Legislature to pass remedial laws. Re
spectfully submitted.
