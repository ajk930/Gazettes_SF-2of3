SOME GOOD SHOOTING
AT SCHUETZEN PARK
for the second time. was won by 'Wrlllam
Collier and Harold Crowell. The only
other team that has. its name on the cupa
twice is composed of the Whitney broth
ers, the present coast champions in dou
bles.
Charles Kuehn and Richard Erskine,
who defeated George Whitney and Grant
Smith, the scratch men, were the other
contestants in the finals, which, although
won in. straight sets, were very close. The
flrst match of the day was between R. N.
Whitney and Werner Stauf and George
AVhltney and Grant Smith. The latter al
lowed their opponents odds of half-thirty,
and won in straight sets,'6-r4. 6â2.
The next match was' won by Al Rose:â
berg and riorman Hodgkinson. who de
feated Fay Beal and Chet Smith rather
easily, 6â1. 6â1. The latter, team had a
handicap of half-thirty, which was too
small.
The last match of the first round was
between Collier and Crowell and Dr.. Lane
and Sidney Salisbury. The latter team,
with odds of half-thirty, was defeated
6-^-1. &â 4. ' In the semi-nnala Kuehn and
Erskine. who drew'a' bye: were pitted
e gainst George- Whitney and Grant Smith.
The former team, with a handicap of for
ty, which was the largest ever allowed on
the local courts, proved to be too much,
as the' youngsters won. 4â Â£,"6â 2. 6â3.
In the other half of the semi-finals Col
lier and Crowell played Rosenberg and
Hodgkinson on- even terms and. won ln
straight sets, 6-3, 6â4. This is the second
time these two teams have met, and al
though -Rosanberg and Hodgkinson are
both probabry better Individual players
than their opponents they were beaten
both times In doubles.
In the final round Crowell and Collier
allowed their opponents. Kuehn and Ers
kine, odds of half-forty and won, 6 â 2, 9 â 7,
6â4. This match was much closer than
the score Indicates.
The winners deserve a great deal of
credit for their victory, as the handicap
they allowed their opponents ln the finals
Â¦was very heavy. . -

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â The present Assembly
has broken all records of extravagance
in the way of Junketing trips. The total
of mileage bills for such trips .already
reaches $7028 20, and several committee
men are now out on trips, and their bills
will bring the aggregate up to the $10,000
mark.
the Way of Extravagance.
Assembly Has Broken All Records in
COST OF THE JUNKETS.
In other respects the report of the com
mittee will be favorable to the Institu
tion. Last, night addresses were made by
different members of the committee to
the boys, gathered together in the As
sembly Hall of the school.
Chairman Irish of the committee is out
spoken in his criticism of, flogging at tho
reformatory, and Schleslnger Is equally
emphatic in his opinions of it. Other mem
bers of the committee agree with them,
and a bill abolishing the practice will
probably be introduced.
The committee arrived at the Preston
School yesterday morning. They inspect
ed its various departments, and were
shown Â©very courtesy by. the superintend
ent and his subordinates. Iirthe cfourse of
the day word came to the ears of some of
the members that a boy who had recently
attempted to escape ' had been severely
flogged, and was still in solitary confine
ment on a diet of bread and water. Sur
prised that such punishment was still
practiced, they asked to see the victim.
He was found locked ud ln a dark, poor
ly ventilated, cell ln which he had to llvo
for three days on bread and- water. His
back was bruised and swollen and discol
ored from the blows Inflicted upon, him
by a burly guard, acting under orders.
Inquiry led to the exhibition of a sole
leather flogging Instrument, specially
made for use in the school. "
Flogging has been abolished at the
whfttier State School, and the members
of the commjfttee were very much aston
ished to find this remnant of early prison
barbarities still existing at tho Preston
School. On the train this morning on
the return trip they held a meeting, an-i
decided that severe condemnation of th>
practice should be the principal feature
oi the report.

Two. spectrograph3 are included- in the
instrumental equipment of the expedition.
They are especially efficient for recording
the coronal espectrum. This Is pre-em
inently the eclipse for such studies. Â¦ The
value - of the work at \ the â¢' recent short
eclipses can scarcely compare with what
It is hoped to get In Sumatra by. making
one exposure with each instrument for
There will be. three Â¦: smaller photo
graphic telescopes, .varying In, size from
six Inches aperture down to one inch. for
recording the outer streamers of the
corona. â¢ . '. . â¢
While only two observers are goin^r
from the Lick Observatory, twelve to fif
teen assistants will be required for the
proper maniuplatlon of the instrument*.
Following the custom of the earlier ex
peditions to India and Georgia, Professor
Perrine counts confidently upon obtaining
these assistants from among the trained
officers in the employ of the Dutch Gov
ernment In Padang. It is not necessary
that the assistants be trained astron
omers," since the work is entirely photo
graphic. Professor Perrine will hope to
have the instruments in readiness four or
fiv* days before the eclipse occurs, in or
der that he may devote his time to thd
training of the assistants, so that they
may take the photographs at the right sec
ond of time, as indicated by the chronom
eter, and in the right order.
Perhaps the most Important' work will
be a systematic photographic" search for
the. so-called planet, or planets, - Vulcan.
Just as the attractions of the then undis
covered planet Ncotuno drew the planet
Uranus out of Its course, and thus led to
the discovery of Neptune, so there Is rea
son to believe that the unexplained devl-'
atlons of the planet Mercury from Its
path are due to the existence of one or
more planets,, hypothetically called Vul
can, between the planet Mercury and the
sun. As this supposed planet, or the3e
planets, must move in a small ' orbit
around the sun as a center, it â or they â
can never be seCn at. any great distance
from the sun, and so are lost ln the fierce
glare of the sky in the sun's immediate,
vicinity.-- At the time of a total eclip3e,
however, the sky becomes comparatively
dark, and the opportunity of detecting
this supposed planet Is afforded.
The Sumatra eclipse will nave a dura
tion of six and a half minutes, and there
is reason, to hope that the sky will be'
quite dark. Four cameras, of three Inch
aperture and eleven feet focus, are mount
ed to take simultaneous photographs on
14x17 Inch plates of the region immediately
to the east and west of the sun." They
are planned so as to secure photographs
in duplicate of a strip of sky six degrees
wide and some thirty-six degrees long. It
Is hoped that all stars in this strip as
faint as the ninth magnitude will be re
corded. Since photographs of this region
of the sky have recently been secured i at!
the L'.ck Observatory when the sun was
in an entirely different part of the heav
ens the comparison of the two scissor
plates, the one taken at the Lick Observa
tory and the o^her in. Sumatra,, should
show the presence of strange bodies in the
sun's vicinity, If there are any such as
bright as the ninth magnitude.-
The 40-foot camera devised by Professor,
Schaeberle and used- by him so success
fully In Chile 5n 1833, 'and by other mem
bers of the staff In. India and Georgia, will
be taken to Sumatra. This Is the first
instrument which recorded the wonderful
detail of the inner ccrona, by virtue of its
large scale (four and a half, inches), to
the moon's diameter. In Sumatra, as' in
India and Georgia, the plate-holder 'end
of the camera will be located In a pit ex
cavated in the ground, probably some ten
or twelve feet. The two observers ma
nipulating the large photographic plates
will be Inside the camera and will see the
image of the corona recording Itself on
the plate. The lens will be forty feet
above 1 the observers,- supported rigidly on
a scaffolding. ; Another scaffolding will be
constructed so as to completely, inclose the
Inner scaffolding, and will be covered with
bamboo matting In order to prevent any
S wind shaking the 3ca.ffoldlng. supporting
the lens. It is expected that twelve pho
tographs of the corona, with . exposures
varying from one-half second to two and
a half minutes, will be' obtained. with this
instrument. . .
The | expedition will travel by way of
Yokohama.: Hongkong, Singapore and Ba
tavla, through the Straits of Sunda, to the
middle of the western coast of Sumatra,
landing at Padang, the capital and prin
cipal city of the Island, and. seat of resi
dence of the Governor General. The mem
bers expect to reach Padartg about April
10. Five weeks-' of extremely hard work
will be required after the camp Is located
to mount the instruments and make the
delicate adjustments, so as* to be ready

SUNDAY FLYCASTING
ON THE PARK LAKE
Harry C. Golcher Surprises All Com-
petitors by His Splendid
Showing.
The first Sunday contest of the Ean
Francisco Fly Casting Club for 1901 tooK
placa at Stow Lake yesterday. The
Â¦weather conditiens were unfavorable, but
the meeting was enthusiastic. A,,numbef
of spectators were present who watched
the casting with Interest, many of them
remaining during the meeting despite the
chilly atmosphere.
The scores throughout were fairly good,
although most of the casters shawed a
lack of practice. This, however, was not
true as regards H. C. Golcher, who was
first In each event, his scores being': In
lonR distance, 115 feet: accuracy. 5>6 feet;
delicacy, S7& per cent. Most excellent per
formances under- the conditions. >

Old Pioneer Hall was erected by the late
James L4ck nearly forty years ago and
has been the scene of many historic
events. When the Pioneer building was
constructed on Fourth .street, the' old
structure was rented for offices. Besides
containing the H acting's Law College, it

awakened by a crackling sound in the
hallway. When he-epened bis door he
found that the fire had already gained
considerable headway and that escape by
the stairways was impossible. He shout

an alarm was turned In. from box 27.
When the fire-fighters arrived and opened
the front door they found that the stair

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 17.-Shrew.1
observers in St. Petersburg believe thar
the Russian Minister of Fnance, M. lie
Witte, in Imposing a discriminating duty
on American manufactures of Iron anl
steel, was not animated solely by a de
slre^to protect sugar producers, but waÂ«!
eager to seize an opportunity to mobilize
Russia's industrial army, with a view of
proving its ability to stand the test oi
a tariff war. It. is believed, moreover,
he desires to Impress Germany even more
than the United States. -. Â¦ . . Â¦.-
The Russian press agent does not give
any particular approval to the experi
ment. The Boerse Gazette, usually influ
enced by the. Minister of Finance, warns
both sides against Implicit faith in tho
Blsmarckian theory that tariff wars do
not disturb good political relations, point
ing out that experience has shown the op
posite to tbe the case, as a rule.
"We hope the friction will bo as qUIck
ly removed as it arose," continues â¢ the
Boerse Gazette, "since the political re
lations now existing between the two
powers are the best they have known.
Both are playing the game of the tertium
paudens. which is preparing a bitter blow
against both.
"Doubtless American public opinion is
wiser than the sugar producers and the
Government that is acting In their inter
est."
The Novosti, correctly representing
Russian public opinion as to the Russian
Government's sugar -policy, demands tha
abolition of the domestic tax and of a
system devised to enable a few lazy
manufacturers to make proiits at the ex
pense of consumers.
Russia's export policy, the Novosti con
tinues is designed principally to support
high domestic prices. It is well known
that one of the chief obstacles to tem
perance work in Russia is the price of su
gar, which checks the consumption of tea.

HUNTINGTON'S ESTATE
WORTH EIGHTY MILLIONS
Executors File a Big Check to Cover the
Inheritance Tax,
NEW YORK. Feb. 17.â The executors of the estate of Collls P. Hunt
ington have deposited with Controller Coler a certified check for
1700,000 to cover the amount of the inheritance tax which will- be
collected by the State. The deposit indicates the worth of- the
estate at the time of the testator's death to have been approxi
mately $70,000,000. making the present value $SO,000.000. The action
is taken at this time to save 5 per cent by '--making the deposit
within the specified time. ,
Much comment will result from the size of the check, which Indicates that
the Huntington estate in value will more than double the estimate placed
upon It at the time of his death. When the will was filed for probate last
August, Russell Sage expressed an opinion that the Huntington fortune would
fall short of $30,000,000. The executor? have indicated that it would amount to
more than twice that sum. Owing* to the rise in railroad securities during
the last six months the Huntington estate Ms now worth almost If "not quite
JIO.OOO.OOO more than It was when the will was offered for probate. .
As the inheritance tax Is based upon the value at the time of the death
of the testator, the estate would now seem to be worth approximately $80,000,
000, a sum far in excess of the most liberal estimate ever made of his fortune
during the lifetime of Mr. Huntingtton. No accurate idea.. as to how the
Huntington millions are invested has yet been made by the executors, who
arcrMrs. Arabella D. Huntington, the widow; Charles H. Tweed and Isaac E.
Gates. That -will become public when the appraisement has been 'estab
lished. Investments were held by Mr. Huntington at the'tlme of his death
in the following corporations: Brooklyn Rapid Transit, California Pacific,
Detroit Gas, Fuente Coal Company, Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio
â¢Railroad; Guatemala Central Railroad. Gulf. Western Texas and Pacific;
Louisiana and Western Railroad, Manhattan Railroad, Metropolitan Street
Railway, Metropolitan Trust Company, Mexican- International Railroad,
Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company; Newport
News Light and Water Company, New York. Texas and Mexican Railroad;
Old Dominion Land Company. Old Dominion Steamship Conipany, Oregon and
California Railroad. Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Southern Pacific Com
pany, Southern Pacific Railroad. Union Trust Company of New York, West
ern Texas and Pacific and Western Union Telegraph."
It was said to-day by an attorney whose information came from one ot
the executors that the Huntington Southern Pacific holdings aggregata In
round flgnres 700,000 shares. These are believed to have, passed" in the recent
transfer to the interests controlling the Union Pacific. The price agreed
upon has not been told, but the market value of the Southern Pacific is now
about $48, the par value being $100. By the terms of the will, which was
filed for probate in the Surrogate's Court in this city August 24. 1900, the
Huntington fortune was divided thus: Mrs. Arabella D. HuntingtonâTwo
thirds of the testator's Southern Pacific stock, -worth $15,400,000 ; residuary
bequest, estimated at $28,000,000; houre at Fifth avenue and Fifty-seventh
street, stable, horses, carriages, furniture, etc.. $1,500,000; specific bequest in
trust, $500,000; total, $45,400,000. Henry E. Huntingdon, nephewâ One-third of
the testator's Southern Pacific stock, worth $7,100,000; residuary bequest,
estimated at $14,000,000; total, $21,100,000. Princess Hatzfeldt. adopted daugh
terâSpecific bequest in trust, JI.Iaw/wO; Archer M. Huntington.' adopted son-
Specific .bequest in trust, $230,000: Edward H. Pardee. nephew, $100,000;
Isaac E. Gates, brother-in-law. $100,000; Hampton Institute, $100,000. Total of
principal bequests, $68,050,000. Other bequests increase this total several hun
dred thousand dollars. This- will make, it is estimated, the value of the es
tate upon wh*lch Inheritance tax may be collected about $68,500,000, though
from this $5,CKX>;000 may be taken as the value of realty.
WILL NOT OPPOSE
ISTHMIAN CANAL
Buitrage's Views as to the
Attitude of Colombian
Government.
NICE. Feb. 17.â In view of the cable
dispatch from "Washington stating that
the- Colombian Government had sent its
Minister of Foreign Affairs to Washing
ton to discuss the question of the Trans
isthmian canal, an interview was had
with Senor Buitrage. the well known
Colombian political writer, who is spend
ing the season here.
"I do not know exactly the object of
the mission of the Colornbian Minister of
Foreign Affairs." he said, "but have In
mind prex-ious declarations of the Colom
bian Uoverntnent. I believe that he Is
proingr to assure the Americans that Co
lombia will not offer any difficulty to the
opening of the Panama canal by the Gov
ernment of the United States.
-Colombia will not. of course, sell the
territory through which the Panama
canal is being constructed to the United
States, nor will she abandon her right3
of sovereignty over, that territory- No
Government in Colombia would dare to
do so. But Colombia Is willing to do
everything In her power to facilitate an
understanding between the new French
Panama Canal Company and the Ameri
can Government in order to complete the
canal in her territory.
"in my opinion, and 1 have said so sev
eral times in different articles, the Nica
raguan canal has always been a humbug
and a bluff. In order to oblige the French
Company to sell its works cheap. I think
the real feeling In the United States Is, as
has been. .that the best way. the cheapest,
shortest and most practicable Is by way
of Panama, with the advantage that the
work is so far advanced that little effort
will be sufficient to carry it to comple
tion."

17.â This has been
an eventful day in the history of Bakers

number of men with teams, plows and

Land Company began filling up Panama
Slough. The outfit has been busy ever
since, and in consequence a large quantity
of clean earth has been leveled Into the
old disease-breeding run that winds Its
filthy way through the heart of the city.
The object of beginning this good work*
at such an unseemly hour was to avoid
being stopped by Henry Miller through
the aid of an injunction. It was desired
to get In one day's work unmolested. Mr.
Miller la here, and It Is expected that he
will ask for an Injunction to-morrow. .
The people are eager to see the slough
filled. For some time the land company
has been engaged in cleaning off and lev
eling the margins of the slough, but no
one suspected that it Intended to fill it.
and therefore all were greatly surprised
at the sudden turn of thing? this morning.
Panama Slough has figured in two exten
sive law suits between Miller & Lux and
the Kern Ctfunty Land Company.
Another event of the day was the open

JAIL AT SPOKANE
, PETER BARDISONIA. 35. married,' wile
and five children. Â¦ â¢-Â¦Â¦--Â¦*â¢
ANTON MAFFADIO. 28. single.
The following story of the accident was
given out by officials here to-day:
C. C. Winton, the paymaster, said he
was sitting in his office. 500 feet awa>
from No. tÂ» shaft, on -Friday morning at
10:50 o'clock when he heard the explosion,
and, swinging around In his chair, saw
that No. 6 had blown up, and there was a
column of smoke and dirt going at least
100 feet In the air. He rushed to the tele
phone and called up No. 4 and instructed
Weighman Ramsay to call in the men at
that mine and brins them to the rescue.
He inquired for the underground man
ager. John Matthews, and round that he
had gone to No. 3. He telephoned there
and caught Matthews just going down
that mine. He informed him that No. t>
had blown up, and, leaving David Walker
there to 'arrange for the. rescue parties, he
ran across to No. b. There tney found
that the force of the explosion had blown'
the fan door down ana disarranged the
fan, but a carpenter was soon at work,
and the fan was going again in twenty
minutes and putting air down.
At No. o the rescuers had a hard time.
They went in quite a distance toward No.
6 when forced back, owing to the fire
having broken out in No. 6. They tele
phoned to ' this effect to Mr. Clinton at
the head omce, and he told them -to in
vestigate If It was smoke or fire that
barred the way to No. 6, and If smoke to
endeavor if possible to drive it back. They
replied that it was fire, the flames having
been seen when they endeavored to brush
the smoke back. All the men were then
ordered out of the mine, and the mules
removed also. There was nothing more to
be done there in safety to the rescuers,
who, as It was, had a narrow escape In
getting out, for two were overcome and
artificial respiration, had to be used to
bring them to. * : .
At No. 6 Manager Matthews took
charge of the rescue party, and many de
termined efforts were made to get down.
The" rescuers found one cage at the bot
tom, held fast, and the other cage was at
the top, having been blown up to the top
of the superstructure, some seventy feet
above the pit head. The wires were
taken from the whole of the fast cage
and fixed to the one at the top and then
a descent was made. On proceeding down.
Matthews says, he found that the ratd
wall had been blown up for 270 feet. It lg
614 feet deep.
They repaired the mldwall as they went
down until obliged to stop, within seventy
feet of the bottom, owing to the great
heat from- the fire at" the bottom. They
were at that depth when a slight explo-'
slon occurred, whigh caused- the men to
come up. and none too quickly, for on ar
riving two were exhausted, and their feet
j had to be rubbed for some time, hot
bricks tied to their sides and other means
adopted to bring them to.
It was thought unsafe to make any fur
ther efforts, and the train having then
arrived, about 10:30 p. m., with General
Manager Little and several experts a. con
sultation was held In the company's office,
at which the experienced miners connect
ed with the workings said they could not
see how any one would possibly be still
alive. Not wanting to abandon the efforts
to rescue the men before flooding the
mine, another effort was madu The fan
was closed at No. 5 r.nd started at No. 6,
by which action, if there was any fire
then in No. 6. it would draw the gas and
there would be an explosion. When at 4:30
a second explosion occurred all hope was
abandoned and the mine was flooded, both
pitheads being; sealed until the efforts of
to-day.
Searching Parties Penetrate the Fire-Swept
Colliery and Hope to Reach Bodies of
v Sixty-Four Victims To-Day* : .
Special Dispatch to The Call. \
â¢jj. yNIÂ°N\ B. C, Feb. 17.-Searching
II I parties are to-night penetrating
1 1 ' J the Cumberland mines to begin
the work of recovering the bodies
"of the victims of Friday's
explosion. The first attempt to enter the
mines since the pit mouths were sealed
was made to-day and parties are now
descending, following the large volume of
air that is being driven into the mine.. If
their efforts continue as successful as at
present the miners expect to be able to
take -out some of the bodies to-morrow,
if the explosion did not cause the mine
to cave in.
The mines had been sealed since the
last explosion, which 'occurred on Satur
day morning at 4 o'clock. When Hon.
James Dunsmuir, the mine owner. In
spector of .Mines Morgan and McGregor
and a staff of officials arrived this morn
ing the covering was. taken from No. 5
shaft and the big air fan started. In its
ninety revolutions each minute, this fan
drove 100,000* cubic feet of air the
mine. This volume of air was driven in
for three hours and at 3:30 p. m. the man
ager and inspectors, together with eight
others, started down, a Davy lamp hav
ing been lowered first to make sure there
was no fire damp. The men were down
two hours before they returned, and,
some apprehension being felt for them,
two miners were "sent to see that all was
well. These miners found the party re
turning In safety. <
â¢ Those* who descended â¢ went along the
workings well on to where the mine con
nects with No. 6. They, saw no signs of
smoke or fire, a plain indication that the
streams of water poured into No. 6^ha\e
extinguished the ftre "there.* The bottom
of the mine In which the explosion oc
curred was deluged with water to a. depth
of forty-two feet before the water was
turned off.
When the fans have succeeded In driv
ing out the fire damp and gas, which they
are expected to do to-morrow, this water
will be pumped out and workers will en
deavor to take out the bodies of the sixty

DELVING FOR DEAD
IN CUMBERLAND MINE
"When the darkness had almost disap
peared two women could be seen In the
distance, running to the scene of the ren
dezvous. They were Mrs. Nation and Dr.
Eva Harding, with whom she had staved
during the nigrnt- Mrs. Nation had actu
ally overslept herself by one hour.
Joint-smashing, she explained, had got
to be such an ordinary affair with" her
tbat ehe never had occasion to lose any
2Â£rs. Hation. I/eads tne Charge.
'"Where can Mrs. Nation be?" was
esked in some anxiety. No answer could
be given other than that she had prom
ised to be there at S o'clock.
And so the questioning went on. .Finally
the army was in the dark, dlsmaJ
corridor tinder the ea.Â«t steps of the Cai>
â¢:â¢Â¦* h<:.id:::z: and calmly awaited the com
ing ot their leader. As they waited their
number was augmented by many more
m<-n. Â¦who entered the State House
grounds with a determined and grim look
on their faces and with axes slung con
veniently over their shoulders. Two men
<-amÂ«? in with great mining picks and oth
ers had tledgehaxnmers. These weapons
were too large for the women, who com
posed one-filth of the party, and they
carried bright new hatchets. All the
plans were made. Soon the electric lights
on the street went out and day began to
breaJc.
"army" were posted. These accosted each
comer in true military style and obliged
l:im to give an account cf himself. If he
wore a white handkerchief around his
neck it was air right and he was allowed
to proceed, as the white Handkerchief wa.s
the emblem worn by the crusaders.
"What is your company V one would
ask of the other.
"Company C. We meet over on the
south stcjÂ»s of the State House."
The-gatherins of the clans at tbe 'State
House grounds was conducted with the
utmost s-eeiecy. Very few knew about the
ir.tended raid except those going to take
part in it. At 4:30 o'clock dark, silent
:ottke might have teen seen hurrying
across the diagonal walks and the lawns
of the State House square toward the big,
ghost-'ike buiUiing in which the business
of .the State is transacted. At every point
of v&ctage ia t-he grounds sentintls of the
Gathering- of th.e Clans.
Ir. the crowd were a large number of
the students of "Washburn College, some
of 'he ministers of the city and a. number
cf professional and business men. The
cr wd marched ia perfect military order.
IJ ere was no excitement, as the men and
w-imen were tollowing the recognized
l^ider, whom they trusted implicitly. The
e. nip any marched silently .out of the
State House grounds, down Kansas ave
nue to the place on East Seventh street
kept by Ed Murphy. and amid the screains
cf the women, the ehouts of the men and
the dictatorial commands of the policemen
present trying to protect the property,
the front windows were smashed In and
won there was very little lett of what
::ad once ocen a well furnished joint.
Mrs. Nation was arrested nere. and
after being taken to the police station was
released. She then hurried back to a iiv
ery barn in which some bars were kept
acd smashed them. Then, at the head of
twenty followers, she went to the Moeser
cold storage plant and entered In the
searcn of some liquors she thought were
stored there. This line Mrs. Nation was
arrested by the county authorities ar.d

of the city, who is a. prominent ntjjro pol

This morning at 6 o'clock. Just as the
big b?!l on the Church of the Assump
tion tDwer was striking off the hour. Mrs.
Nation sallied out from the State House
grounds at the head of 500 men and wom
en, .-11 armed with hatchets, and moved
on tae joints of the \city. Nobody knew
but Mrs. Nation what the plans of the
raid" were to be.

caused.
And when I woke up(" she added, we
did not hurry, as the doctor's ciocK was
an hour slow. But we are here now. We
will begin work at or.ce. too. Get In line
there, men and women. We must, go
about the Lords work now. Get your
hatchets ready and fellow me."
And they aid. Carrie Nation, the re
doubtabie joint-smasher, was tbe leader,
and the people in the company followed
her slightest wish. Two by two. with no
excitement, weapons? in hand, they moved
out on their mission of destruction. In
the front proudly marched Mrs. Nation,
with her famous hatchet. Behind her
were Mrs. Rose Christ and Mre. Made
line Southard, who accompanied her on
last week's trip to Chicago, and Dr. Eva
Harding. Next came six T\'ashburn Col
lege boys bearing an immense battering
ram. Three of the boys were on each side
of the ram, which they held with one
hand, and with the other hand they
clutched a bright, new hatchet that had
bet-n procured f;>r them by Mrs. .Nation
yesterday. As they entered Kansas ave
Â«iue 8om'o of the women wanted to stop
and demolish Sims' drugstore, which .has
the reputation r-f selling as much liquor
as any joint in the city. Mrs. Nation de
murred. She had other plans and meant
to enforce them. She gave the order to
march again and the crowd followed her
as before.
As they passed another notorious place
the crov>d -wanted to stop again, but Mrs.
Nation had not yet reached her starting
point. The crowd then turned the corner
at Sixth street and soon reached the front
d"or of Murphy's fashionable Joint.
Four policemen stood at the door to
guard the entrance. They commanded
tÂ»V people in very dignified tones to stand
back.
â¢Smash! Smash! Smash!" called out
Mrs. Nation. "Don't pay any attention
to them."
Boys Use Battering Ram.
The boys with the battering ram came
forward and In less time than it takes to
tell it the big plate glass windows were
shattered into thousands of fraisments.
Dozens of men then rush*d on the build
ing armed with their axes and soon had
the dcors and window frames cut entirely
away. Then with an exultant cheer the
crowd burst into the building.
"Praise God. women! Smash tho bot
tles ana the. windows!" called out Mrs.
Nation again, and raising her famous
hatchet she sent it through a window
glass that had yet tx-en left.
The policemen managed to recover from
their scare by this time and to grab Mrs.
Nation. They started off with her to the
station as rapidly as possible. She waved
her arms and frantically called out to her
co-workers: "Oh, keep it up! You can
do it without me! Praise God. keep it
up; keep on smashing. You don't need
me."
l"or a moment the crusaders were
thrown into confusion bv the removal of
their leader, but the parting words of
Mrs. Nation seemed to nerve them to
better efforts. The crowd surged forward
into the building and soon ail tbe front
part of the room had given way and all
could enter at will.
A man inside struck a match and then
turned on the electric lights. A case of
beer was founQ in the room and it was
soon smashed. Slot machines, cigar
cases, billiard tables, chairs, counters and
evjn the stoves were smashed to smith
ereens. The policemen danced hither and
thither, trying to keep the crowd from
destroying the property, but their efforts
w*>re expended in vain. The doors of the
outbuildings were smashed in, but no
more liquor was found. During the night
it had been removed to a place of safety.
In Need of a Leader.
After being- satisfied that there was noth
ing- else to destroy, the crusaders left the
building. Then it was that they found
their need of a If-ader. They once more
marched to the State House square, to
taik over the situation. The women com
posing the party were filled with wrath.
They declared that the men were cow
ards and that they never would go out
on a raid with them apain. The earnest
words of the women aroused the men,
and with loud crjes of excitement they
started again downtown to destroy some
rr.ors Joints and to make their work com
plete.
Then It was that the Rev. F. W. Emer
son, who was Mrs. Nation's manager
during her recent lecture tour, rushed to
the front and called on the crowd to de
sist from their purpose, telling them that
the entire city was now awake and that
further action would be useless. Dr. Eva
Harding .engaged in a spirited argument
with the minister, during which some' very
choice compliments were passed on either
side. What was. left of the crowd then
dispersed.
Bar Fixtures Wrecked-
But while this was going on. another,
and more interesting scene was being en
acted in another part of the city. The
doughty Mrs. Nation had been released
from the city prison as soon as she was
pottÂ«?n there and she again started i out
on her work. She gathered about J her
si me of her followers that iiad not fÂ«l
lcwed when the large number wen. 'back
to the State House grounds and com
manded them to follow her. She led the
v/ay to a livery stable, where some bars
were stored. She was met at the door by
the proprietor, who assured her that there
was nothing of the kind in the building.
She demanded to have the privilege of
looking, however. She ordered two or
three of the men present to ascend to the
loft and ascertain its contents, giving
them particular orders to search through
all the piles of grain, as there they would
be the most apt to find some liquor. Mrs.
Nation at last found in a little room back
of the office the tine bars that had been
ordered for the use of the jolntists of tne
city and never used. Picking up a leg of
a chair that was lying near by, she im
mediately smashed the mirrors and other
wise injured the bars.
"I wish I had my hatchet here." she
remarked: "but if I can't get it the leg
of a chair will do just as well."
Raid on the Storage Plant.
Sirs. Nation then led the way to tbe
Moser cold storage plant, where the
jointists cf fhe city have been in the habit
of etorine their extra stock. Only a few
went out with her â¢ but she was deter
mined that this should be treated the
same as the Joints. Mrs. Nation man
aped to enter the cold storage plant, but
foend herself in the poultry room. She
then tried another place, and got into tna
en ? I 9, < L. r^ on i By thls Timo Sheriff Cook
and Chief of Police Stahl came upon the
sceno and placed her under arrest. This
time she made auite a scene, and was
taken to the County Jail in the patrol
wagon. Her arrest this time was on â¢>
county warrant sworn to by the colJ
storage people charging her with break
ing a lock.
When Mrs. Nation was aarain taken
downtown she was confronted with an
other arrest. This time It was for enter
ing the Murphy joint. By tf.is time thÂ«
people of the city had bejan to wake up
and soon the streets were full of eaEer
seekers after the latest ncw3. Kxtra Is
sues of the morning papers contakilng tho
details of the dramatic happenin&s wero
eagerly purchased.
Mre. Nation thus gained one triumph in
the mornine. but another was reserve I
for her in the afternoon.- .t.,,fÂ»?
Crasader ? s Second Triumph.
Mrs. Eva Marshall Shontz of. Chicago
was addressing an immense mass-meeting
of men and women in the First Christian
Church when she all at once stopped with
the remark: "Well. I guess tnere is 'no
use Tit me trying to speak any more."
The people looked toward thj main en
trance of the church and saw the reason
why Mrs. Shontz stopped talking.
Mrs. Nation, whom most of the audience
thought was yet in Jail, was walkimr
gayly up the aisle. The entire audience
arose, and the sacred edifice rang again
and again with the cheers of the admirers
of the woman who had led her followers
to victory in the morning. She was helped
to the rostrum, and here she bowed her
acknowledgments to the ovation she re
ceived.
Mrs. Nation raid she was going to re
main "right here in Topeka" until after
the city election, so she could help in the
election of the Mayor. *
The meeting then adopted some resolu

her at the close of the meeting. Sha was

General Voyron, the French commander.
received letters asking for their co-opera
tion and expressing a desire to know what
forces they can spare. In commencing
his letter to General Chaffee, Count von
Walder3ee says:
"Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of
the negotiations for peace and also to cir
cumstances rendering such a course desir
able, it will probably be necessary to re
sume military operations on a large scale,
especially toward tha west."
It is not thought likely that General
Chaff ee will agree to such a plan without
instructions from "Washington. The
Krench commander, however, is expected
to do so. Count von Waldersee's plan-*
contemplate offering the command of the
expedition in the first instance to Sir Al
fred Gaselee. the British commander, but
it Is believed that In view of his recent
illness. General Gaselee will inform Count
van Waldersee that he Is unable to accepn
the command. In that event It will be
offered to General Voyron, provided the
French fall in with the arrangement,
which Count von Waldersee believes will
be the case. Such an offer to General
Voyron would have the effect, it is
thought, of overcoming the difference-*
which have existed between the French
and Germans, because it would be a dem
onstration of Count von "Waldersee's con
fidence in the military ability of the
French contingent.
Ere long an announcement is expected
that the destination of the proposed ex
pedition Is Sianfu. The foreign envoys
believe its object to be to compel the Chi
nese to accept the terms of the powers.
U is thought that when it becomes known
that the expedition has started the-im
perial court will hasten, to comply imme
diately with all the demands of the Joint
note.

. AT HAIR-RAISING TALES
COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo.,' Feb. 17.â
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt is in Colorado
Springs and is the guest of P. B. Stewart,
who was one of the members of the hunt
ins party in Rio Blztnco County during the
first three weeks of the hunting. Colonel
Roosevelt Is in excellent health and spirits
and will return tp the Bast in perfect
condition for the arduous duties upon
which he is to enter so soon. His time
until the inauguration, will â¢ be taken
up with attending to his vast correspond
ence, the accumulation of six weeks. A
public reception will be tendered him in
this city to-morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock.
He expressed the desire that nothing In
the nature of a banquet be held, and the
reception will be simply a public informal
hand-shaking occasion granted to the
people of Colorado Springs by the Vice
President-elect because of the friendly
feeling that has sprung up between them.
Colonel Roosevelt is much annoyed over
the hair-raising stories that have been
circulated concerning his hunting experi
ences. To a correspondent he gave the
following statement to-day: :
No correspondent of any newspaper, no man
who wrote cr gave any information to any
newspaper nai within forty miles of where
I was hunting at any time during: the five
weeks I was out. | The sensational stories, such
as those describing: adventures with bears and
wolves were deliberate and willful fabrications
and. I understand, were written by men who
were not within hundreds of miles of where
I was.- We did not see a bear or a wolf on
the entire trip. Aside . from lynx and smaller
game our hunting was confined to hunting the
so-called mountain ".lions or panthers. - I got
twelve â¢ of them. , I never, enjoyed a . holiday
more. I have never been out with a better
hunter than John Goff. His hounds are with
out exception the best . I " have ever seen for
their work. "As I arm obliged to go East: in
view of the nearness of ; the .Inauguration, I
am. to my great regret, unable . to address the
Colorado legislature In accordance with their
extremely kind request.?

DANISH GOVEBNMENT
BBEAKS OFF NEGOTIATIONS
LOXDOX, Feb. IS.â "The T>anish Gov
ernment," says tho Copenhagen corre
spondent of the Daily Mail, "has suddenly
broken off dealings with the United
States regarding the sale of tho Danish
West Indies. This Is due to a satisfac
tory offer made by the E>anish I East
Asian Steamship Company to assist and
in the future to administer the islands.
The American Government has been no
tified as to this decision."
less. Deputy Sheriff Lawson was waiting
In the vestibule of the church all the
while, and when Mrs. Nation came out
he stepped up to her. with the remark that
he had a warrant for her arrest.
Mrs. Nation smiled good-naturedly.
"Another warrant." she exclaimed. "What
can that be for? They have served three
upon tne already to-day."
"It's for defacing property," said the
officer.
"Liet's see It," said Mrs. Nation. "De
facing property! Why. I defaced no prop
erty I just destroyed It. I never defaced
any property. That is a ridiculbus charge
to bring up against me. But come along,
Mr Officer, I am not afraid of a Jail." I ve
had considerable experience with - them
lately while I have been about the Lord's
work." . . ,
Turning to the eager crowd or wonder-
Ins people she said:
"They have just pot another warrant
for me, and I'm going- to jail" again. I
will be right out, though, women, and so
go on malting your arrangements."
Arrest Causes Great Excitement.
Fully 2000 people followed Mrs. Nation
and the officer as they started to the
County Jail. The officer was obliged to
draw" his pistol to keep the crowd back.
It was with the utmost difficulty that the
jail was reached. All along the way Mrs.
Nation was in, the best of -humor. ThÂ»
route to the jail- was through the most
aristocratic part of 'the city., and as the
people ran to their doors to watch the
strange sight of a great mob filling up
Topeka avenue on a quiet Sabbath after
noon they" were met with smiling greet
ings from Mrs. Nation. Young men pleas
antry nodded and tipped their hats in the
most gallant manner possible.
The news of, the arrest of Mrs. Nation
had reached the downtown. "district by
this time and as the officer hove in sight
with his . prisoner he ' saw the street in
front of the" Jail one seething mass of
humanity. Further up the street hun
dreds of others, men, women and children
were i running to the Jail -as fast asithtlr,
feet would carry them. If the interest in
Mrs. Nation had at any time been latent,
it had now broken out with fever heat."
The Chief of Police, with a detail of of
ficers, was soon on the scene,- and it. took
much hard work, together. with the vig
orous use of clubs and threats of. worse
treatment, to get an opening in the crowd
sufficient to permit Mrs.' Nation- to be
taken into the jail office. ,
It was a crowd bent. for the most part
on curiosity, but there were many turbu
lent Epirits there, and for a time it looked
like serious 'trouble would ensue. Nobody
knew any reason- for a-riot," but the riot
ers were there and a riot was narrowly
averte'd. â¢
At no time was Mrs. Nation In the least
alarmed. She remarked more than Â¦ oneÂ©
that it was a very nice looking lot of

e NEW ERA GR0ND JURY.
rROM out the remote recesses of Georgia' there
comes a voice of good cheer; it is the voice of a
Grand Jury making a 'report of a new kind. In
stead of'reporting -upon, the '.condition of the jail and
other county institutions, the. prevalence of crime and
the difficulty of suppressing it, this Laurens County
jury took a survey of the Whole community and re
ported progress. â¢ - r â¢â¢ ' â¢ Â¦ ' Â¦ â¢ '- Â¦;..'Â¦
The document began by. declaring: "We, the Grand
Jury, congratulate the County of'Laurehsthaton the
opening of the .twentieth' century there is .so much
evidence of enterprise 'and-'progfess ' on" every 'hand.
During the last decade the' County of Lauren's doubled
w population^ and Dublin (the county v seat) is more
than three and a.half times as large as in 1890, furnish
ing a market for the produce of the county unexcelled
in Georgia." * "' '* ' < \ .
Truly that- was a new and surprisingly glad voice
from, a Grand. Jury, but there was better to come.
The voice mounted- in pitch of joy-and increased in
volume of glad tidings,; as. it \ytn{ pn^ until, the .grand
sweet song closed in thci, words :â¢.= '.'We congratulate
ourselves upon the spirit. .of good-fellowship and har
mony which exists- between the people, of the town
and country, and trust that it will ever cbritinue to be
$<5.'' In the remotest corner of the county the people
take pride in the upbuilding of Dublin^ because every
person in Laurens knows that as that city increases in
the -county' k \yill increase* in importance
and every interest in the county will thereby be
benefited." . .. ., ,. ., _ â'Â¦Â¦ ... , t
Now none of that" may be legitimate Grand Jury
business, but all the" same -it is. better" business than
most Grand Juries do. It is worth imitating. Some
, California Grand Juries might find it worth while to
find out the good as well as the evil of their coni'mu
riitjes^and report luporr the: Harmony thatlexists be
tween the people, of the county seat and the people
"of, the. country. '. Talk; of that kind may. not tend , to
the Suppression of" crime or the improvement of
county institutions.. but all the 'same it may be as true
a bill as ever a Grand Jury fdund'ahd be more bene
ficial than the usual custom of reporting : all' the evils
of a community and i.one of its virtues. - -| â¢
pitying encouragement the firm grave him
Southwest Missouri in which to secure
trade, and when but IS years old he
packed his trunks with samples and es
sayed the forlorn hope of getting up a
"paying business" -in what was then re
garded as the slowest district of the West.
In six months he had proved that he was
a first-class traveling salesman, and in
twelve months he was reinforced with an
assistant. Southwest Missouri began to
be a profitable factor in the earnings of
the house, and the trade grew continually,
requiring soon a number of men to care
for it. -
Instead of limiting his field f>t .opera
tions to the newly discovered territory the
young salesman led his older helper up to
take full charge of the trade there and
then went back to his superiors and asked
for other tasks. They gave him in turn
the remotest, most difficult and least hos
pitable districts, and be built up valuable
trade in each. He did not fail to give
himself due credit for these achievements.
With all his silence, discipline and loyalty
he had a full appreciation of his personal
value as a salesman and organizer. After
three years of this work he toM President
Samuel Cupples. the head- of. the firm,
that he had reached a point where It
seemed most profitable for him to engage
In business on his own account. Mr. Cup
ples had already placed a high valuation
on the services' of the young Marylander.
and so instead of. permitting him to set
up as a competitor he offered to his sales
man the position of junior Â¦ partner and
general manager of the firm. In twelve
years the young man had attained- the.
position of vice president and the house of
which he was yet manager had surpassed
every competitor In its" race tor commer

The Rescue of a Great Library.
Up to this time Mr. Brookings' success
had been . dependent upon his ability to
gain trade, upon hard and incessant' work
and upon his ceaseless energy in. looking
after the physical requirements of a grow
ing business. In -1SS2 his. salary was-in
creased from $10,000 to $25,01X> a -year. As
a financier hfs talents were widely recog
nized, and he was accepted as a,n author
ity among credit men and a counselor of
bankers. He became a director of the
Mercantile library, 11 l?Â»rge, cumbrous and
money-losing institution dear- to the hearts
pf his fellow-citizens, but slipping into de
cay for lack 'of 'good business manage
ment. Mr. Brookings secured plans tor
a new building for the library, floated
the bonds and supervised the construction
or a suitable home for the books. - The
structure is one of the best, office build
ings in. St. Louis and a source of abundant
revenue to the" Mercantile Library, which
occupies the upper floors. Through sav
ing this popular public institution Mr.
Brookings came quickly into. prominence
as a wise and generous man of: affairs.
During the dozen years of his closest ap
plication, to business,' the young merchant
not only studied art, but became a liberal
patron- of artists.. His good . judgment
enabled, him- to appreciate the best prod
ucts of foreign and: home studios .and he
collected pictures of high merit., In Lo
cust street, near Jefferson avenue, he
built for himself a beautiful " residence,

pitality 'dispensed there. Â¦ â¢
A Notable Economy in Business.
â¢'. Not' satisfied -with having built Up a
trade the greatest of Its kind. In the world
Mr. Brookings conceived the idea of con
centrating under one roof and in one vast
warehouse. all the. great business houses
of the city. His. plan included the saving
of drayage, thÂ« avoidance of warehouse
charges and of the loss of valuable time
in and 'shipping freight- of all
kinds.' lie Induced Mr. Cupples, his busi
ness associate, to Join him in acquiring
ground in- the heart of SO -Louis and erect
ing upon it a structure ..vast- enough to
house comfortably more than a score n'
the largest business concerns in St Louis
The leading wholesale grocers and jobbers
did not fail to see the advantage of the
change.; They became tenants of '.'Cup
ples Station."- as it is. called... So famous
was the success of this' enterprise that the

planning for the university's future. Its

to his eyes dreary and unattractive. He
conceived the idea of making for it a new
home on a beautiful eminence near Forest
Park in the western suburbs of the city.
He headed a subscription list for the pur
chase of the land ami soon had prepared
the way for the new buildings. on the site
which he had chosen. â¢
Mr. Brookings then Induced Mr. Cupples
to join him in an audacious and generous
scheme for" the endowment of the univer
sity. A little over a year ago they trans
ferred to it the magnificent ."Cupples Sta
tion" with its . annual revenue of more
'than. $150,000. It was the most princely
gift to a university ever bestowed be
tween Chicago and San Francisco. *At the
fame' time Mr. Brookings transferred ti
the university his salary of S25.OX) a year.
He remains the president of the univer
sity's board of trustees, and under his
supervision a splendid group of buildings
is being erected for the institution's needs.
Getting a Hint From a Competitor.
Mr. Brookings' busy life has left him lit
tle time for extensive travel or recreation.
During the thirty-four years of his busi
ness career he has not had more than six
months' .vacation, and even then he was
not ablo wholly to withdraw his mind
from the affairs!* of his firm. Ills close ap
plication to Its Interests is illustrated by
an incident which occurred while he was
on a pleasure trip to Alaska In one ol
the coast towns he found on sate clothes
pins made by his firm, but bearing the
mark of a competitor^ Wondering how
his rival could undersell him with his own
wares he pursued hlg inquiries till he
found that while his goods were going to
Alaska by way of Cape Horn those of his
competitor were sent direct by way of
Vancouver. He was not content until Re
regained control of the Alaska market.
Within the last few years Mr. 1 Brookings
has purchased a beautiful estate and
country residence below Crystal City on
the western bank of the Mississippi. Here
iÂ» his summer home, and here are .his
chief art treasures, his library and his
deer park, and here he spends such leisure
as he can gain from the cares. ot business.

i ARE/WE HHAD-hUNTERS?;
W.H^EN objection was made to some of the meth
ods pursued" in the Philippyves it was. metflw
the state'rtieut that the islanders' were of savage
Malay blood and were nothing but' head-hunters, ac
customed to taking the heads of their enemies and
putting the same on exhibition as a means of intimi
dation. At that time it seemed throughout Christen
dom that such a 'misuse of Jiuman heads was an evi
dence of barbarism so revolting that those who dil
it were outlawed from Christian sympathy.
The same Christendom that held up its hands in
horror at heathen head-hunting is now in China
piously struggling to open the way. for Christianity
to walk into the affections ol the people. We have re
cently published, the testimony of Americans to the
fiendish methods pursued by the Christian troops in
Chin?. The unspeakable crimes they have committed
are all the more horrible because their' vile and
beastly conduct stands in contrast with the courage,
enterprise and se.h'-restraint. of the heathen Japanese
soldiers. These !atter are admitted to have been the
best soldiers on the march and in siege and battle,
and not a stolen tael nor an inhuman outrage is
charged against them. Next after them in godd quali
ties our Alncricari soldiers are placed by common con
sent. But, untouched by any sentiment of mercy and
unmoved, by any good example, the Christian forces
of Europe have charged yip against them a record
biarker than was ever made before by any troops
civilized or savage.
. Sir Robert Hart, the English Commissioner of
Chinese Revenues, has' published in the Fortnightjy
Review a statement of the inhumanities which came
under his. own observation.: . It will be remembered
that when his wife went through San Francisco a.
few months ago' she made one of the first statements
about the system of butchery and outrage that pre
ceded and attended the march -upon Peking.
Sir Robert says: "The days of^Taepirigdom, when
native warred with native, showed' nothing worse, and
the warriors of this century can. be. as brutal; with all
their, wonderful discipline and up-to-date weapons, as
were ever the savages of earlier times" with toma-^
hawk, boomerang or assegai, and the puzzle is to ex
plain why it should have been so, or forecast the con
sequences in the future." . â¢â¢ ' Â¦ ' . ' '
Another Englishman, Dr. E. J. Dillon; who spent
six years t in' Armenia, a witness to the T.urkish out
rages in thatcountry which so' moved Christendom,
has printed in'ihe Contemporary Review an acoutit. of
bis observations -and experience in China while 'ac
companying 'the allied troops of ChrisYendorn. His
account is. under the caption, "The Chinese Wolf and
the European Lamb.". He says: "All, along the
march to Peking it -was. the same sickening story-
Chinese girls and women of alL ages first outraged
and 'then bayoneted by troops whose Government^
were wrapping themselves in the soft 1 wool of Mary's,
little lamb." \ Â¦.'Â¦'.' ' . , v Â¦ Â¦ ', ''
Dr. Diilon then gives in detail the appalling crimes
he witnessed. through all the country between Peking'
I and the sea. He saw three daughters of a Chinese of
the upper class subjected to treatment unspeakable
and immediately after run through with bayonets by
soldier's who represent Christianity and civilization.
A Chinese father and his little son of eight years were
shot down in the name of Christian civilization while
they held each other's hands and begged for mercy.
Hundreds of. peaceful villagers were cut and hewn to
pieces after. witnessing indescribable' conduct against
i their wives and daughters"," which spared -'none -be-'
tween the ages of six and sixty.. He f saj's that Chi
nese women soon learned that.no worse could befall
them, than 'to fall'into th- hands of the Christians', and

A CHEERFUL TRADE OUTLOOK-
{F the formation of the gigantic steel combination
be excepted. last week was devoid of especial fea
ture as far as trade was concerned. This combina
tion, which rcpre'senls $800,000,000 of capitalization,.
lias been worked very carefully in order not to disturb
the money market, and in this, at least, has been suc
cessful. In fact the effect of the combination was to
steady a growing weakness, in. Wall street - and to â¢
1 race up the industrials, which were showing" signs of
flagging. The coal stocks .were especially : firm,, as.
they zxe intimately connected with the. iron and" steel
trade. Russell Sage .-eems to' take a 1 bearish vie'vv'of
the immense combine and rather looks for a financial,
squeeze later on. but "this operator's views are riot"
Â«hared. as far as known, by the other prominent
operators in Wall street.
As far as general trade is concerned good reports
are being received from all parts of the country. The
bank clearings for the week. showed a gain of 36.5 per
cent over the corresponding week in looo, arid Min
neapolis was the only important city to exhibit a fall
ing off. The gain at New York was very large, being
(35 per cent, and at Pittsburgh the center of the iron
and steel industry. 5p per cent. This shows a healthy
condition of the iron industry. Indeed, while sonic
disposition has been shown here and there to hold
back from buying iron and steel supplies until after
the final establishme.it ol the trust, purchasers are
finding difficulty in getting the mills to name positive
deliveries in the near future, and some are so crowded
with orders that they are> not looking for any new
business. Railway supplies and structural material arc
in the best demand, there is no disposition to shade
quotations for finished product?, and pig iron is ac
tually rising at Pittsbiirg.
The other staples cs a .rule arc firm, except wheat
and cotton. The former is carrying a load of large
EappSes and heavy world's shipments, which keeps
the market depressed. r-nd cottoti fabrics are quiet, with
tome mills idle and England buying raw cottou from
India, in unusually large quantities. Wool still lag-;,
though the sales at the three leading Eastern markets
rose to 6.792.000 pounds, breaking all recent records
and showing a gain of nearly 1,000.000 pounds ov~r
the same week last year. The boot and shoe trade is
ir.akinj? a very satisfactory exhibit at the moment
The demand is so active that many manufacturers are
booked several months ahead and buyers cannot- se
cure-March delivery save'in exceptional cases. Drum
mers are returning from the West and the South with
cheerful reports, and 'hebusiness is in good condition
ail around. The. feeling-in lumber is also firm. Pro
visions have been- more or less -unsettled for some
little time, but the. maiket is' without especial- feature-
Failures are falling off in number, though they arc
niil numerically ahead of la^st year, those for the weefk
being 257. against 218 for the same week last year.
ThÂ» i> the biis-nic'ss showing for" the week throughput

saying.; "I have had four months and a half to ex
amine the subject to my own satisfaction, and I have
come to the conclusion that the mining region of the
Seward Peninsula, which includes all of Western
Alaska north o,f Norton Sound, contains the richest
placer deposits of gold of any that have been discov
ered" since the days of '49 in California. After having
made '.that positive statement I may qualify it to the
extent of saying that the Klondike region may pos
sibly exceed this region in the output of precious
metals during the next, decade,- but" I do-not believe
it will." . ,
It is to be noted, moreover, that the firmness of the
United States Circuit Court, sitting in this city, in
sentencing McKenzic to imprisonment for non
compliance with the orders of the court, will have a
wholesome effect in advancing the prosperity of the
Nome country. It assures, to the miners the ample
protection of law, and will ! prevent , any further
schemes, in the way of grabbing mines, such as se
riously interfered with the industry of the district last
year. .Thus the prospect of Alaskan mining is much
better than it has ever been before. The trade of the.
country will therefore in all probability go forward
with leaps and bounds, and the merchants of San
Francisco should note the efforts made at Puget
Sound to capture the trade and put forth equal efforts
of their own. ;

The new American twelve-Inch naval
gun of 40-caliber length is claimed to fire
an SSO-pmind projectile at a muzzle velocity
of 2JC-! foot seconds. This would make it
the most efficient Run afloat, for the Vick
ers pun of like caliber and length fires
its 850-pound projectile at 2700 foot seconds
velocity, but only 24S1 fobt seconds are
claimed for it. as the initial trial of a
new gun must not be accepted as the
work it Is ablo to do-ri^ht alonff. The use
of smokeless powder wears out thÂ« bore
of the gun and rapidly diminishes its ef

engines are of 2S0O horsepower, calculated
to give a speed of twenty-five knot9 with
a load of forty-two tons. These are. the
first torpedo boats ordered since 1S34, and
indicate, a readoptlon of small vessels
capable of maintaining a reasonably nigh

Contracts for ships building for the

of the sixteen destroyers and fifteen tor
pedo boats have been granted one year's
extension of time, and the contractors

It was stated some time ago by a yel

graphed to this country that Mr. Wat
son, the noted yacht designer, bad been
requested by the admiralty to give his
opinion as to the best means of making
the new royal yacht less of a failure;
that Watson's report was a scathing crit
icism, and that it concluded with the rec
ommendation that the yacht ought to be
sunk" with all the persons who were re
sponsible for the failure. The only grain
of truth In the story Is that Mr. Watson
was engaged to give his opinion on the
vessel, but he had not up to two weeks
ago submitted his report, and he has posi

Church preached a strong sermon
.last, evening on the Chinatown and
racetrack evils. In part he paid:
"A burning disgrace to our boasted Chris
tian civilization Is the traffic In human
chattels that obtains in Chinatown. That
old 'legend of a monster to satisfy whose
appetite a city had every year to sacrifice
a number of Its virgins, who were led away
trembling to -his bloody den. Is no fable In
San ' : Francisco. O. the unspeakable guilt
of whites and Mongolians alike who grow
rich on the red revenues of this Infamy!
Was Â¦' God .: long-suffering toward the peo
ple of Sodom?:. How much more toward
us. who sin, against a greater light? It Is
of -San Francisco that the Master" says, 'If
the mighty works had been done in Sodom
that have been done 'In thee, it would long
ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes;
wherefore, it shall be more tolerable In the
day of Judgment for. Sodom than for thee.'
Hardly Ices iniquitous, is the proposition to
reopen. Ingleslde. The cultivation of a
horse's speed is no.more'sln than the cul
tivation of 'vegetables. If the Lord made
fast hqrses it was to have them, go fast.
The evil begins when the betting begins.
"The racetrack as It Is conduct
ed to-day, is a training school
for vice and defalcation. It has
become a synomyn for nil that in
degrading. The majority of the
people of the. city *o understand
It, and nt the poll* *o expressed

Interest of the cultivation of the
California; horse. â¢ Let the issue
be drawn. It. means the ruin of
the California boy. Which shall
it be, city fathers, the California'
horse or the California boy?
"The condition of thtngs have made a
great many ' good people pessimistic as to
better things for our city; but matters
have not. gone so far 'but what there is
hope for! reform." The hour is at hand
when lovers of order and ' decency p will

Continuing, he adds:
"An evening dally paper warns the min
istry to avoid the trap that unscrupulous
investors in the racetrack , across . the bay
have set for the unwary. Even if this ad- "
vice might otherwise be sound it can be but
useless now, for thus the ministers of this
city had been deceived three . times al
ready, and to listen at this late day to
these warnings confesses previous ignor
ance,. which disqualifies flie pulpit from
fhe right to moral leadership and places It -
beneath the reformer's notice. :
"I hold that the , ministers 'have not been
deceived. I do not believe that a single
preacher who waxed eloquent- In .1899 and
19C0 In defense of our day of rest and of
our homes, against the evils of . Ingleside
would care to retract a single word.
"In the meantime the gamblers . have
preached most effectively; their gospel is ;
that of persistence. W.hy should the
friends of morality grow I weak and " fall
by the. way?
"Declarations do not create facts. To say
that the closing of Ingleside has in no way

imity to this city, with Its quick

sit, is a fertile. source of crime

- "Tet sin should always be fought In every

without its own inherent worth, though no -

"One may admit that the ministers of this -
city have | nothing in common with the
managers of the Oakland track,, and that
the press which opposes Ingleside is sub

REV. E. A.. WOODS, the well-known

APPEALS TO

"Our own police seem to be efficient In the
use of the ax In semi-occasional raids upon
thÂ« outer doors of camblinc dens in the
Chinese quarter; now let them wield the
same weaixtn in smashing the doors j of
brothels, gambling tables and the heads of
the lawless who shall resist them. A sharp
ax is a legal instrument for the suppression
of rattlesnakes and mad dogs.
"Thls spirit of compromise or
complicity with acknowledged

proposal to allow racetrack gam

ntlve officer of. San Francisco Is
too weak of arm or heart to sup

flu incentive to crime, to compro

of society, which ought to arouse
the indignation of every true
man in the city.
"The testimony before the legislative com
mission relative to human slavery and to
gambling would indicate a timidity or con
nivance on the part of those sworn to exe'
cute our laws which is a reproach upon the
courage and honesty of the citizens bt this
city, who are shamed through their repre-

I lnr. Rev. E. F. D'.nsmore, pastor of
the Second Unitarian Church, spoke in
part as follqws:

USB OF THE
NATION "AX"
"(?) The social evil among both whites
and Chinese is a great source of municipal
corruption. The condition of Chinatown In
regard ' to social Impurity makes It ' the
worst plague epot In the city. Here a sys
tem of inhuman slavery is carried on
among Innocent Chinese girls that this
slimy pit of disease and death may continue
to pollute our city. These awful evils must
stop. To enforce the laws pertaining to the
renting of property for either gambling or
prostitution purposes would aid 'very mate
rially in remedying these evils."
?
"If onr law-making body deter

hands of a compact of gamblers
they alone .must assume all the
terrible responsibility.
"I cannot believe that these leaders in

Through the noble efforts of the better

was legally closed by our Supervisors and

and Miss Lake of the Methodist and others,
is of incalculable value, nor should the good

rir.p address against the slavery
In Chinatown and the proposed opening of
the Inslesice racetrack.
The shocking story of slave-dealing was
unfolded In all its horror, and seldom has
a houpe of worship witnessed such emo
tional scenes as took place lasf eveninp in
Pr. Bane's church. Men and women wept.
Dr. Bane himself was moved to tears, and
ringing applause swept through the
church when he said thai in addition to
reviving the old cry, "The Chinese must
pn." that "Phelan and his allies must also
eo."
The children and rescued slave girls
now in a Methodist mission were present
in the church, and in addition to singing
hymns, in English and Chinese two of the
older girls told of the horrors of their
livps in the slave der.s of Chinatown. The
R^v. Dr. Gardner acted as interpreter.
Miss Margaret Lake, who has rescued
many of the girls, was called upon by the
Rev. Dr. Bane to tell of her experiences,
pnd the young laoy moved her hearers to
trars sis she described the scenes which
are of nightly occurrence in the alleys and
dens of the Celestial quarter.
In part the Rev. Dr. Bane spoke as fol
lows:
THE rest edifice of the Califor
n!a-Â«trret Methodist Episcopal
Church, at California and Brod
erick Ftre^ts. was crowded" to
the door? last evening, when the
Rev. Dr. Bane delivered a stir-
drafted at the instance of the Chinese
missions of San Francisco by their at
torney, Henry E. Monroe, and they I
have the indorsement of the members
of the committee. J
The first bill Is an amendment ta
section 151 of the Penal Code and
makes a felony of the holding of or
assisting in any manner to hold any
person In involwntary # servitude, with
a maximum penalty of ten years' im
prisonment. The law as it now stands
makes a felony of the purchase or sale*
of a person for immoral purposes, but
that 'tectlon has been practically a *
dead letter. The missions which have
attempted to protect Chinese ,Â«uÂ»d Jap
anese women from slavery ha.\-e sel
dom been able to prove that they were
sold or purchased for immoral pur
poses.
The second bill is designed to obvi
ate another difficulty met- by the mis
sions in their rescue work. At present
if rescue is attempted by filing a peti
tion for letters of guardianship of a
Chinese girl slave the girl is spirited
away. If the girl or clild Is seized by
officers in a raid possession of her Is
regained by her master on habeas cor
pus proceedings, and If letters of
guardianship are subsequently granted
she cannot be located. The proposed
new law is designed .to remedy this
condition by giving the- courts power ;
to grant temporary custody of a minor
under certain conditions. It is In the
form of an amendment to section 174?
of the Civil Code and reads as follows: '
The Superior Court of each county,- when
It appears necessary or convenient, may ap
point guardians for the persons and estate*,
or either of them, of minors who have no
guardian legally appointed by will or deed -
or who are Inhabitants or residents of tha
county, or who reside without the StatÂ» "â¢
and have estate within the county. Such
appointment may be made on the petition ,
of. a relative or other person on behalf of
the minor, or on petition of the minor. If
14 years of age. Before making* such ap- !
pointment the court must cause such notlca
as such court deems reasonable to be given ,
to any persona having the care cf such '
minor, and to such relatives of the minor
residing in the county as the court may
deem proper. In all such proceedings, when
It appears to the satisfaction of the court. '
either from a â¢ verified petition or
from affidavits, that the welfare of
the minor will be imperiled If
such minor Is allowed to remain in tha '
custody of the person then having the cai%
of such minor, the court - may make an '
order providing for the temporary custody '
of such minor until a hearing can be had
on such petition; and when it .appears to
the court that there Is reason to believe that '
such minor will be carried out of the Juris- '
diction of the court before which the ap
plication is made, or will suffer some ly>
reparable Injury before compliance wftfc
such order providing for the temporary cus
tody of such minor can be enforced, such
court may at the time of making such order
providing for the temporary custody of such
minor cause a warrant to be Issued, recit
ing the facts and directed to the Sheriff,
Coroner or Constable, of the county, com
manding* such officer to take such minor
from the custody of the person In whose
care such minor then is and place such
minor in custody In accordance with the
order of the court.

REV. J. GEORGE GIBSON*, pastor of
Emmanuel Baptist Church. last
evening devoted his sermon â¢ to a
..denunciation of the Ingleside race-
RACETRACKS
ARE A CURSE
TO OUR BOYS
"Within fifteen minutes' walk of
this church 1000 girls are sold and held In
a slavery more abject and hopeless than
ever degraded the Southland. Nearly half
are as yet In domestic slavery, to be grad
uated Into Immoral life when their more
than Â£00 sisters are degraded for the profit
of their heathen masters; and the Christian
property holders of Chinatown whose share
of the price of degradation and shame to
these girls comes to them In larger rentals
than any honest business can afford to pay.
And protection In their nefarious compact
Is either given or sold .to these twin devils.
Christian and pagan, by those empowered
by our suffrages and sworn to enforce the
laws. And this is under the American flag
In the commonwealth of California and In
the municipality of Ean Francisco.
"I wonder where is the manhood of our
citizenship. In 1834. under a condition of
things less dreadful, the vigilance commit

needed then half so much as now? The out
rages against law and order and decency
, and the personal rights of the helpless are
greater every week In this city and furnish
a Juster occasion for an uprising than every
combined wrong for whfch our fathers
waged a war of revolution through eight
years. It Is time that we had found our
patriotism and recovered something of the

exclaim, 'AXD ,WHAT DO YOU

"They are going to deliver the racetrack

FOLLOWING are a fnv excerpts from the sermons preached
yesterday by the ministers of San Francisco against the re~
opening of the Ingleside race track:
;" ; REV. A;C. BANEâ "To reopen Ingleside is to open the Hood
gates of crime and disgrace."
REV. H. T. SHEPARDâ "I believe that Ingleside's proximity
to this city with its quick and inexpensive means of transit, is a
fertile source of. crime and is prolific of ruined homes and of blasted
' characters." x .:
REV.E. NELANDERâ"The race track as it is conducted to
day is a training school for vice and defalcation."
FROM a score of pulpits ministers of San Francisco yesterday
poured forth their .protest against vice in Chinatown and
against the reopening of the Inglesidc race track. In no un
certain terms the clergymen told of the terrible state of affairs that
exist in the Celestial quarter and called upon their congregations to
aid in hazing the vice suppressed. The recent investigations in the
Chinese quarter by the Legislative Committee gave the preachers am
ple material for their sermons. The unfortunate Chinese girls who
ar: being held in bondage by their cruel masters received the sym
pathy of all listeners.
A mass meeting was held in the California M. E. Church last
right. Slave girts told of their sad life in these dais of iniquity and
the Rcz-. Dr. Bane, who has made a study of the subject, poured
forth invective against the white' men who allow their property to bo
used for immoral purposes. The Rev. Dr. Wilson suggested that a
zigilaiice committee should be formed, as there was sufficient provo
cation for the citizens of San Francisco to take affairs in their ozvn
hands and liberate the poor women and girls who are being held in a
bondage even worse than that which brought about a great civil war
in this country.
Xor were the clergymen less in earnest over the proposed scheme
to reopen Inglesidc race track. The speakers pointed out the duty of
the Supervisors to suppress rambling in this community, and stirring
appeals were made to the Citv Fathers not to violate their solemn
obligation to their constituents by throwing the city wide, open to the
gamblers. Manx of the ministers appealed' to their congregations to
use their good influence to prevent the perpetration of such a terrible \
scheme. They were all of the opinion that the reopening of Inglesidc
race track would ruin many more homes, create a still larger crim
inal class and cause untold suffering throughout the city.

From "Becky Sharp" to the "Waifs of
New York" is rather a sharp come-down
for the California this week, but a large
audience seemed to be greatly pleased
with the last named piece last night. The
scenic effects are good, and a company
that filled all the requirements of the va
rious parts worked zealously. The play
tells the same old story of the "villain
foiled," and the foiling: Is done by Miss
Faith Howard, who as. Willie Rufus was
"Johnny on the spot" whenever there
was any foiling to be done. Ivorln J:
Howard â¢ makes a good Dutchman, and
Nellie Filimore plays Biddie McShane
with considerable unction. A courtroom

OHEDRE last night was chief of
fering of the Bernhajdt-Coquelln
people at the Grand Opera-house,
â!_ and still have we not ( seen the
grertt French actress ,at her. best.
In "I/Aiglon" was lost the charm of her
passionate, alluring femininity, with all
its grace of gesture and sensuous charm
of vole". In Racine's masterpiece all this
is there, but the note of the tragedy is be-
I ynnd reach of the artist â out of her
gamut. The Phedre of Bernhardt is but
, a Greek Camille. She has not the air. the
touch, the-classic accent; her passion is
Parisian, not Greek; her love for Hippo
lytus shown in fashion fitter for a Gallic
Sapho than a Grecian queen. One feels !
the sting and b'ite of the dreadful ardors !
that consume the faithless Phedre all
through her interpretation, but of the
queen, accustomed with a sort of god
like elemental insolence to know no law
higher than her own will, there is no
seeming.
Nor is there of the woman fallen from
high estate in her own eyes. It is tin**
Sardou demi-mondaine transplanted to a !
Greek soil, and out cf key with her sur
roundings. Not that these were exactly
inspiring last evening: Search high,
search low, it would be difficult to find
a more irresponsive Ilippolytus than that
of M. Deneuburg. In the midst of Phe
dre's most passionate appeals he stood
"at attention" with considerably less ani
mation than is otsjuUly displayed by the
ordinary able-bodied lay rigure. â¢ The
Theseus of M. Desjardin was altogether
the most satisfactory portrait of the cast.
Broadly conceived, dignified, nobly, built,
it was true in key and entirely worthy in
1 conception. Mme. Patry was well see"n
in Oenone, and Aricie was well played in
miniature Bernhardt fashion by Mile, i
Damiroff. M. Piron as Theramene did
good service.
**Les Precieuses Ridicules," the second
part of the evening's programme, was a
piece of deliciousness not soon forgotten. |
Anything more delightfully droll, unc
tuously humorous, absurdly, absolutely,
irresistibly funny than Coquelin's Masca
rille is not of this earth. He is altogether
lovelyâ a fop of fops, a bfble of inanities,
the last word of legitimate comedy and
I Moliere's hero to the life. Also he is ex
i cellently supported. A delightful French

began a fopr hank was noticed over the
orfin. It moved in and at about
the sixth inning the back fence
of the park was out of sight. In the mid
dle of the first ha'f of the seventh the
fielders were invisible from the prand
stand, and they could not see the ball
when it was hit at the plate. Any kind
nf pop fly was tfood for two bases. Ea

fell within six feet of Briseno's feet. He
heard it. hut when he picked It up Kasran

The feature of yesterday's event Â¦ was
the close and exciting coursing which re
sulted almost throughout the card. The
colors of the> B short-ender were raised
often enough to ' break the monotony of
the pikers paying for the rfght of disput
ing the -judgment of frhose adherents of
the game who figure dope, though the
day's results gave the favorites' much the
better of the play.
Pleasant Girl In the" first evenffurnished
the initial surprise by outpointing King
Cotton, who was held a 5 to 3 favorite. A
baker's dozen -of selections gained their,
decisions without a miss, and then Rcyal
Union, who figured -to be an Important
factor if he pased his first opponent/lost
his chance to Royal Hush In a short
course by a single polnK Flush sold tit
3 to >5. Following: closely Erin gave the
form! players- a hard knock by sending
Sacramento Boy beaten to his kennel. Tho
Boy was expected to entertain the specta
tors well along to 'the finish of the stake.
Krin's? performance was- an expensive
demonstration of their error of judgment.
Odds 5 to 1, score 6 to 2. ; . â¢Â£*$
O. Zahl's Miss Wilson brought relief to
the players who want odds for letting the
others take first pick. In the third round,
against the fast Warship, she scored one
point more' than did her opponent, and as
& result her backers looked happy while
waiting to cash their 4 to 1 tickets.

A general discussion of the question
took up the entire two sessions and will
be continued to-day. It was universally
conceded by all of the speakers that a
change in the endowment laws of the or
dÂ«r is .Imperative and that Its present sys
tem is unsafe. No definite conclusion was
reached in the matter, however nor was
any comprehensive plan offered for the
desired change. It developed that there Is
a little opposition to a general plan of
graded assessments, and the subject will
occupy the attention of the delegates from
all parts of the Pacific Coast at to-day's
srssion. The meeting wIHJast until Tues
day, when the officers for the ensuing
year will be elected.

To Miss Tibbey Taylor belongs the
honor of being the first girl to try a
"rummage sale" on a generou3 public.'
Tibbey has just got back from New York,
where the "rummage sale" it at present
flourishing like a green bay tree. The
minute she stepped off the - ferry-.boat she
began to speak and plan for a "rum
mage" that would make the coffers of thj
Infant Shelter full to overflowing. She
had her way, and now she can go 'round
and say: "Didn't I tell you so?" Maybe
It wasn't a success! "Why, that little store
on Minna street was crowded from morn
ing until late at night, and I never saw
such a grateful lot of purchasers as the
poor that carried off for a mere song- the
many bargains offered. The sale had its
pathetic side, as well as its funny side.
My eyes felt teary when that poor, pale
faced boy carried off a suit of flannels for
25 cents, saying: "Nowl can' get well."
But I want to say. something about the
wonderful possibilities In Tibbey Taylor â
possibilities which, if 'developed, .would
make her the most remarkable of all
saleswomen. This is not a conclusion that
I have come hastily by.. I watched her
holding up skirts to- show the style and
cut, ppinting out the flowers on some
faded hat and marking them down and
down till they met the purse of the needy
purchasers. . She made more sales than
any other girl interested in the Shelter*
And I heard more than one purchaser
calling down blessings on her bonny head
Bless her for her good, kind heart! say I

gagement presents were so many sold and
such fancy prices given for them. I wager
that no other girls with solitaires on the
third finger of .their left hands can point
to su'ch magnificent collections as those
that grace the Scott and Crockett tea
tables.

the skillful management of the irreat
finances, retiring with honor in 1S95, when

connection with the Lick Trust he was
made an honorary member of the Cali
fornia Society of Pioneers. He took a
great interest, too. in the Crocker Old

member of the Board of City Trustees.
Ten years of this time he filled the presi
dent's chair, retiring in 1893. His resi
dence in Alameda extended t>ver thirty
seven years. A large estate at the west

a series of grames. such as cards, check
ers, chess and â¢indoor methods of exercis

Speddy to-day, "that tliis boys* club is
fostered by the women of the Political
Equality Club merely. There are as many
supporters of the idea outside of the club
as there are in it. It is purely an effort
to assist boys who â¢ have to work in the
daytime and . can't go to the public
schools. We are going to invite them to
the clubrooms and cive them every
chance to learn. It Is a grand cause, and
one that should receive assistance from
every high-minded person, f
"All of the boys of the cltv who havo
a mind to join the club will be invited to
become members. Ther* will he no coÂ»t
to them whatever. There will bÂ» depart
ments for vocal and instrumental music,
parliamentary law, literature. â¢ military
tactics, manual training and probablv
cooking. A small savings bank will bÂ«
established to influence the boys in the
habits of thrift and saving.

the banquet and for three hours mirth
re ifuring SU^he progress of the feast the
members and their friends were enter

musical selections by the orchestra, Louis
Haake acted as toastmasjer and called on

responded in a happy vein.
\fter disposing of' the edibles the floor
was cleared for dancing- and the Jolly

' The boys' club was suggested at a re
cent meetrnj? of the Folitical Equality
Club. The ladies became enthusiastic
over, the Idea, and before the gathering
dispersed a committee had been chosen to 1
report upon a location ami the sources of
support. ' Mrs. Thomas H. Speddy, as
chairman of the committee, was assisted
in the undertaking by Mrs. M. E. Mc-
Laren, Mrs. George H. Perry. Mrs. George
Hawley and Mrs. Richard A. Clark.
The report of the committee, which was
favorable in. every respect, was submit
ted to a meetinff of about thirty women
at Mrs. Speddy's home last Monday afi
ernoon. An advisory board with power
to select clubrooms and solicit subscrip
tions was then chosen. It consists of
Mrs. McLaren (chairman). Mrs. Speddy
(secretary), Mrs. Perry. Mrs. Hawley and
Mrs. Clark. This board sought a place for
clubrooms yesterday. After . looking at
several they found none more suitable
than Fraternal Hall. It contains two
lare-e assembly-rooms, with ante-rooms,
and the rent Is very low. Considerable
work must be done in fitting up the
rooms, but this will not cost much, as
most everything necessary will be do
nated, and the labor will be performed by
the prompters.- No trouble ! was experi
enced in getting subscriptions.

Of course, the wedding presents were
beautiful, and there were any number of
them.. The groom's gift, a diamond sun
burst! was worn by the bride. Mr. and
Mrs. Hopkins gave their daughter a mag
nificent set of silver, complete.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I never knew a girl to do so much work
just previous to her wedding-^as did Edna
Hopkins. Thursday morning found her
downtown making: the last of her pur
chases. It was she who .planned tho
dresses worn by her attendants, and th'>
shower bouquets they carried were all
designed by her. I consider those, bou
quets the auaintest conceit of many .1
day. From each long-stemmed bunch of
pink, carnations there hung a long- rop.j
of Â¦Dlooras, and as the maids stepped tp
either side to form a passageway for the
bride each one took hold of the danglins
rope of blossoms, thus forming an aisle
of flowers for the happx . couple to pass
through.
While on the engrossing subject of
dress. I want to sav a few words about
the stunning grown worn by Mrs. Au
gustus Tavlor, the sister of rtie bride. It
was a magnificent dress, all Clunie laco.
and its only trimming was a big, bold
black velvet bow pinned on the front of
the corsage.
â¢ * â¢
Everybody was. filled with happiness at
the Hopkins-Taylor wedding to see the
bride's mother looking: and feeling so
well and so near perfect recovery. S\i<>
was all gowned In white â duchesse lace
over white silk, with only a dash of pink
at the corsage to relieve it all.
The most troublesome part of the bride's
outfit. I understand, was the finding of
suitable hats. It's between seasons now.
and the dear little girl sensibly decided
to fill her bandboxes when she returned
from the honeymoon trip. However. .she
got one hat. that will make you think
Easter has come, when you see It perched
on her dainty trown head. It is of finest
tucked black chiffon, flat as a pancake,
and its only trimming is a bunch of pink
roses' that nestles round the brim. . .
If I had never been told it I would have
known at first glance that the lingerie
came from Paris. In the first place, it
was all hand made. Then it â¢ was all
trimmed with Valenciennes and torchon
lace. Oh. the chic of the yards and yards
_'f pink baby ribbon fashioned into dainty
bows and pert little rosettes! And. oh, the
monograms! Yes, the lingerie bore the
Paris mark, and it required np coaxing-to
make every one who looked at it exclaim
again and again at Its loveliness.
Such gowns and, oh. such lingerie! All
finest batiste and lace and ribbons,, and
fine enough and "smashing" enough to
exhaust all the adjectives In one's vocabu
lary. The lingerie all came from Paris
and the gowns were all made here; and
when I think of the beauty and the style
of them I really feel I must make my best
bow to the locul dressmakers who de
signed and made them ajl.
First there were two . stunning lace
gownsâ one over pink and the other over
the palest hlue. The one over the delicate
rose silk was of finest Valenciennes and
looked as though it had come from some
fairy loom. It was made long and cling
ing, and in its very .simplicity lay the art
of the maker and the beauty of the gows.
A pink cloth 'reocptlon gown, of that
new cloth with" a finish and sheen like
panne velvet, took the breath away from
all the girjs who were lucky enough to
get a glimpse of it.
-The "going away" gown was the sweet
est frock, to my way of thinking, of all.
It was of that now shade of blue and of
some new thin material that goes by a
long French* name, hard to remember and
which means nothing. It wds all laid in
tiny pleats and trimmed with white lace.
A blue hat. flat, as is the fashion now.
trimmed with white lace and white
roses and set Jauntily on top of the part
ed pompadour, was worn with that dress.
I stand ready to wager there was not
another gown in all her collection that
gave the fair young bride the great pleas
ure that the tea gownâ her first oneâ did.
If you had seen it vou would not marvel
at sweet Edna^s joy of it. Palest of deli
cate blue, of some soft, fluffy material,
laid in accordion pleats and all trimmed
with white lace. Then it has "angel
sleeves." a feature of a gown no girt was
ever known to be able to resist.'
Â« i" EVER d'd girl . go forth a bride

Committees of * Legislators
and Merchants Go Over
the* Ground.
* .- /
The Judiciary Committee sent out by
the Legislature made an exhaustive ex
amination of the -China Basin question
yesterday. The lease to the Santa Fe was
discussed pro and con, and when the
whole situation had been laid before those
on the tug Governor Markham everybody
decided that the measure was a good one.
The Governor Markham got away from
Mission-street wharf about- 11:30 a. m.
Among those on board were Harbor Com
missioners Kllburn, Harney and Herold,
Secretary English, Chief Engineer
Holmes and Chief Wharfinger Percy
Henderson. :
The merchants' committee on board
was composed of Frank J. Symmes,
(president),' Captain John Bermingham,
Wakefteld Brown, R. Swayne, W. H.
Roussell, Horace Davis, G* Wormser, H.
D. Loveland. A. Chesebrough, â¢ William
Haas and F. W. Van Sicklen. These gentle
men will leare for Sacramento to-day
with the Judiciary Commmtttee^n order
to lay the merits of the lease properly be
fore the genate and Assembly.
The Judiciary Committee Is composed
of Davis of Tuolumne, Selvage of Hum
â¢boldt, Lukens- of Alameda, Smith, ot
Kern, Simpson of Los Angeles and Wolfe
and Ashe of San Francisco.' Besides these
were Senators Devlin of Sacramento and
Lardner of Auburn. .
The State t,ug was nearly half an hour
late getting away from her dock, and
then she headed for old fishermen's
wharf. A stop was made there to enable
the committee to view the old -structure
and thus give the members a chance to
compare the new structures in course of
construction at North Beach with it. The
comment on all sides was .that- the ac
commodation as proposed at North Beach
would make the finest fishermen's head
quarters in' the world.
From North Beach the Governor Mark
ham carried the party to China Basin.
There more than an hour was spent. Sen
ators Selvage of Humboldt and ; Simpson
of Los Angeles wanted to, know the why
and wherefore about everything.) Harbor
Commissioner Harney was the . principal,
spokesman, while Chairman Kllburn. who
stood In the background, volunteered' a.
suggestion whenever there was a hitch
in the proceedings. Herold^
spent his whole time in answering ques
tions and he was kept busy from the time
the tug left the wharf until she got back.
After the China Basin .. business had
been thoroughly thrashed out and -Chief
Engineer Holmes had laid down the law
and explained the proposition Senator
Lukens asked that the tug be run over
the line on which the Santa* Fe Â¦Â¦ proposes
building a breakwater â¢ or seawall. .-, The
Governor Markham -was therefore run
from the old hay wharf In a direct line
to where, the Marion is ' now - moored at
Long wharf. Asked If a 'drawbridge
would be erected over Channel street in

A. Lewis, a shoemaker 35 years of age
and out of work, committed, suicide at
1020 Folsom street early .yesterday morn
ing by turning on the gas. He went to
the house Saturday .night and asked the
landlady-, Mrs. Becker Adams, to be al
lowed to sleep on a table, as he-had no
money to pay for a bed. He was allowed
to sleep on. a table, and about 6 o'clock
yesterday morning he was found dead by
J. JSchleb. The room was tilled with gas.
Lewis had attached a rubber tube to the
burner, and after turning on the.gas>hact
placed the end of the tuoe In his mouth.
His body was taken to the Morgue.
Lewis left two notes, one written in
English and the other In Hebrew. In the
former -he wrote: "Unable no more to
tight for subsistence. Broken down In.
health, I took my life, although I was
examined at the Mount Zlon Hospital this
week and they told me I was in the best
of health." I want my friends to excuse
me. I. wish they .would notify Mr. Hertz
berg from Howard street and Mr. Hodes,
â¢the buttonhole maker, from Mission ;
street, to take care of my remains." â¢ The
note In Hebrew, translated, reads:
"Brothers in Jewish faith, please take
me and bury me as a Jew. .Mr. Herta
berg and Mr. Hodes, In case you can't do
it, notify the Eureka Benevolent Society,
as a sister of mine will come hera Very
soon. When she comes let her know
where I am. I was a Jew and remain a
Jew as the rest of them."
Robert McKenna, a painter, quarreled
with his wife at their residence, 25 Lily
avenue, early yesterday morning.. He
told her he could not live with her any
longer and said he would take poison. He
left her for a moment and came back
with a glass in his hand: He drank the
contents of the glass, but she paid no
attention to him, thinking he was only
jesting till he began to vomit.- Then she
got frightened and ran for a doctor, who
advised that her. husband be sent to. the
Receiving Hospital. He was taken to the
hospital in the ambulance and was* at
tended to by, Dr. Thrasher, but died,
about 6 o'clock, j and his body was taken,
to the Morgue. ; Â«'â¢Â¦ .
McKenna had swallowed a dose of ar
senic. He and his wife did not live hap
pily together, so it is said, but she never
imagined he would commit suicide. They
had two children,, one , six years of age
and the other.- four, years. . . .
A. Moeller, a baker residing at'5Sl
Hayes street and" 59 years old, ended his
life yesterday by swallowing a dose of
carbolic acid- in the rear -of a Â¦saloon at
the corner of Hayes and Laguna streets.
As soon as Moeller's condition was no
ticed the ambulance was sent for and ha
was removed to the Receiving. Hospital,
where he dtedy, ten minutes after his en-
cause leading up to Moeller taking
his life was grief over the loss of his son,
who was one of -the. unfortunate young
men who met death on Thanksgiving day

From China Basin the party .went to
the Hunters Point drydock and looked
over the British steamer Heathcralg that
is being cleaned and painted. From there
the gentlemen were taken to the proposed
site of the new dock, and Supervising En
gineer Holmes explained the scope. and
plan of the structure. It will be one of
the largest docks in the world when com
pleted and one of the finest. . . â¢ .
A cold collation was spread for the in
vited guests at noon, arid as "Colonel

fairs It is needless to say that the /father
ing was -a success. The "colonel" Is a
past master at sandwiches, and there.was

Commissioners said It would be without

\ Health is not a question of muscle'anci sine*, but of resistance
and endurance. It is nerve- force that gives to the body that

life and resist the encroachments of disease. When headaches,

nervous powers; when, the restless twitchings of the muscles, the
throbbing of the heart, the irritability of temper and the depres-
sion of spirits proclaim the approach of nervous prostration, it is
time to call a halt. The worn-out must be rebuilt and tho

Ever since then there has been trouble,

day in the resignation of Chief Engineer
French. Flrpt Assistant Engineer Â¦ James
and Second Assistant Engineer Gibson.
Ever since the Warren made port there
has been a wordy warfare going on be
tween the engineers' department and the
supervising engineer. The vessel arrived
.here in a disabled, condition, and the
"buck" was passed up to Chief Engineer
French. He declined the present and
pointed to his reports of six mon.ths asro
in refutation. In them he showed that
the boilers and furnaces required over
hauling, that a new-smokestack was an
absolute necessity and that many other
minor jobs required attending to. No no

ren was pent to sea to be gone two

The Palena is of 3397 gross tons burden,
8*50 feet long, 42 feet beam and 24 feet deep.
She Is fitted out luxuriously and Is a
flfteen-knot boat. Â¦ .
The Palena is about five years old and
is a fine specimen of the modern steam
ship. Captain J. C. Moon Is conlldent
that she will remain In the California
service, and In. consequence brought his
three children up with him to be edu
cated here. Mrs. Moon will remain in San
Francisco to look after the youngsters.
Besides these the Palena brought up
twenty cabin and eight steerage passen
gers.

it will not be their fault If the.: entire

When the keepers arrived and attempt
ed to enter the paddock the three buffaloes
prevented the men from reaching the body
of the dead animal, and for some hours
they remained on guard. Finally, when
hunger led the watchers to where piles of
hay had been thrown, the â¢ keepers se
cured the body, it will be mounted and
placed in the Park, Museum.
With lowered heads the three bulls at
tacked their companion, and the sound
of the meeting could be heard for a long
distance. Time and time again the but
falo attacked would lock horns with one
of his antagonists and like trained gladl
atcrs neither would budge an inch.
Finally, while the. great beast that was
fighting for his life was thus locked with
one of the three, the two others drew off
to a distance and charged down ppon
him. Deeply they gored his sides and
he was borne to the ground. With
fierce energy the three buffaloes
stabbed their prostrate companion,
driving their horns into his body. Though
weak from loss of blood, the wounded
buffalo made an attempt to rise.. Each
time he attempted to get to his feet he
was borne to earth by the rushes of his
enemies. Then with mighty bellowing
the three victorious animals placed their
horns beneath the dying buffalo and
tossed him repeatedly into the air. each
descent to the ground serving to beat
out the last sparks of life.
Three of tne buffaloes were pitted
aeainst a shaggy monster, who for the
last lew years has been the pride of the
Park Commissioners.
E. B. ilayer of 253 Geary street was the
only eyewitness of the encounter between
the infuriated anlmaJs. Mr. Mayer was
riding his bicycle in the vicinity of the
buffalo corral when he heard the animals
bellowing in the distance. The next mo
ment the four bultalces came into sight,
tearing over the ridge of ground which
skirts the bicycie path.
A battle royal between four male buf
faloes in . the Golden Gats Park corral
yesterday morning resulted in the death
of or.e of the animals.

According to the statements. of the Sa.n
ta Fe officials Vannler was discharged be
cause of Inattention to duties. , He and
Gavan were never particularly friendly.
George : Vannler, the young man who
was with Gavan when he cashed the
checks,- was located at his residence, '303
Montgomery avenue, yesterday by the po
lice and taken to headquarters. He was
questioned by Captain Seymour', in the
presence of Mr. Donnelly, and denied all
participation in the: affair. He said that
he met Gavan going into' the bank; and.
as they had worked together in the yards,
he waited until his friend came out. They
chatted for a few minutes later, and then
Gavan said he had to go to the yards. He
started down California street and then
Vannlc-r went home.
"Lots of the men complain that they are
among the victimized," said Donnelly last
night, "but I am satisfied that all who
lost any money have reported to head
quarters. We cannot keep them from
talking, and some may. be taking ad
vantage of the situation for . their own
benefit. The, checks will be examined at
the bank as soon as it opens to-morrow
morning and then we will be able to verify
these figures." *.
According to Assistant Superintendent
Donnelly, there was a line-up In the yards
yesterday of the men who had entrusted
the collection of their checks to the suave
stenographer. The .total is now said to
be $745, an increase of $200 over the amount
estimated by Mr. Donnelly the previous
night. Donnelly says he is confident that
this will cover the total amount.
Frank J. Gavan, the missing stenogra
pher of- the Santa Fe railroad freight
yards, who collected a number of checks
for his fellow employes Saturday and
then dropped completely out of sight, has
not been heard from since.- "He Is sought
by detectives and disappointed employes,
but so far has carefully covered his
tracks. â¢Â¦*, ; -.;,

Costa asserts in his letter that from
that point he again wrote to his wife.
After a hard time of it In Calcutta he
managed somehow to get back to Ai^tra
lla. where he shipped on a coal vessel that
landed at Santa Monica last September.
Costa tells Chief Sullivan in his letter that
he has been an Invalid ever since his re
turn from his adventurous voyages, and
that he has written four times to his wife
without receiving reply3. He expresses
the fear that his wife might be led to seek
a divorce from him, and the court records
show that this fear has 'good grounds for
existence, as such a suit was actually
brought a month ago. - â
Costa tells a strange story in his letter.
He declares that he was "shanghaied" in
San Francisco two months after his mar
riage and was put on a ship bound for
Australia, On his arrival there he wrote
a letter to his wife in California, describ
ing his harsh experience. He boarded an
other vessel in Australia, which he was
told was bound for California, but Instead
of that its destination proved to be Cal
cutta, India.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 17.-A case re
markable in the annals of divorce pro
ceedings has developed here. On January
16 May Abbott. Costa brought an action in
the Superior Court for divorce from her
husband, M. M. Costa, charging desertion.
It appeared that the decree would be
granted without opposition, but a letter
received by Chief of Police Sullivan from
Costa, datrd Los Angeles, February 13,
may serve to obstruct proceedings.

At a recent meeting cf the board of di

of California resolutions were passed ad
vocating the encouragement of the intro

which were made by the large congrega
tion in the galleries and the cadets. The
"Veni Creator" was sung and the voices
of the young leaguers rilled the edifice
with melcdy, the organ playing a soft
voluntary. The singing was remarkable
for its strength and sweetness.
Father O'Rvan then read the prayer

at its conclusion ascended the pulpit and
delivered a striking address. He spoke
upon vouth being the formative period of
life and how the hopes of the nation are
centered in the rising generation.
"A nation of temperance or temperate
People Is a nation of heroes." he said.
"Drink begets all kinds of evil, debauch

At the conclusion of the review Arch
bishop RIordan called Colonel Powers and
his staff to him and bade him express to
his command the gratification he felt at
their noble bearing and magnificent dis
play.
Then' the cadets filed out and lined up
on Van Xess avenue nearly. 1000 strong
for a dress parade and review. The red
coated band of forty pieces was stationed
in front of the cathedral steps, at the top
of which tho Archbishop stood. A great
mass of people lined the sidewalks, and
the martial air with which the youthful
warriors bore themselves won plaudits
from the spectators.-
Benediction of the blessed sacrament
followed, the Archbishop officiating, with
Father O'Ryan as assistant. On its con
clusion the "Te EWum" was sung.
I declare before Almighty God. and you Most
Reverend Father, and in the presence of thl*
congregation, that I hereby solemnly renew for
the followinc year the promise of temperance
according to the rules of that branch of the
League of the Cross of which I am a. member,
and may God sive me the grace to keep this,
my pledge, in the name of the Father, and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Another hymn and a few short prayers
and then the pledge was administered.
In a loud, clear voice the archbishop read
it while the right hand of each youthful
leaguer was firmly upraised and their
voices repeated after him the following
words:
The Italian Consul will shoVtly file suit
to have the deed given by him to Baciga
lupi. as attorney for Cuoco's heirs, set
aside, on the ground iiat it was obtained
by fraud and misrepresentation. He says
that when he accepted Bacigalupi's offer
of $800 he did not know that other bidders
had been to his secretary offering $5000 for
the property. Realizing that there had
been fraud committed in connection with
the sale of the estate. Consul Serra is de
termined to get at the bottom facts.
"It matters not who is interested," said
Attorney T. J. Lyons, who represents the
cqnsulate. "The Consul has been grossly
deceived and he will not rest until he has
shown up those who betrayed his confi
dence. If the suit he intends bringing to
set aside the Bacigalupi deed is won by
him bids will bo asked for the property.
While Bacigalupi obtained a deed from
the Consul for $S00 and ex-Public Admin
istrator Drinkhouse sold the same prop-,
erty to Henry Bohls for $2000, neither price
is reasonable. I know of one party who 1^
willing to pay $20,000 on. ten minutes' no
tice If he can be given a clear title."
Consul Serra is anxious to have the deed
he gave set aside. He will be assisted on
that line by Attorney Harding, who repre
sents clients who expected to get the land
for $5000. Harding intends attacking the
Bacigalupi deed not on .the ground of
fraud, but on the ground that the power
of attorney received by the Consul Is de
fective. He expects to prove to the satis
faction of Judge Troutt that the power of
attorney is not properly drawn, and that
In consequence Consul Serra could not-le
gally dispose of the land to Bacigalupi.
While the several syndicates of schemers
who planned to loot the estate of Giovanni
Cuoco are engaged In denouncing one an
other preparations are being made to
reach the oil supposed to lie under the
tract of so-called "desert land" in Kern
County left by Cuoco. Machinery valued
at $7000 has been placed on the property,
and unless restrained by order of court
the owners of tho plant. will within the
next few. days commence drilling for oil.
The oil-drilling rig is owned by the Tiber
Oil Company. The company claims. right
to drill on the disputed property by virtue
of permission granted by W. II. McKenzle
and S. N. Griffith, who assert ownership
to. the land, contending that they located
it under the mineral land law when- they
heard that the patent granted to Cuoco
was worthless because of his failure' to
comply with all needed legal requirements
to perfect title. McKenzle and- Griffith
own. so it Is said, the controlling interest
in the Tiber Oil Company. Griffith and
McKenzle, as already published in The
Call. have, a suit pending In Kern County
to quiet title to the land. They seek to
secure title on the ground that Cuoco set
tled on the property under the homestead
law, but that ho did not live upon it and
that In consequence the patent issued to
him by the United States is invalid. Theo
dore Baclgalupi. who bought the land
from the Italian Consul for $800. claims
that McKenzle and. Griffith are working
in the interest of Henry Bohls. who paid
ex-Public Administrator Drinkhouse $2000
for the property. Attorney Charles G.
Lamberson of Vlsalia. who now holds a
one-third interest In the property by vir
tue of a deed recorded by Bacigalupi, says
that Griffith and McKenzie have no inten
tion of bringing their suit to trial. He
says that they filed suit against Drink
house to frighten off other people, with
the understanding that there would not be
any contest and that title would pass
without need of confirmation by the Pro
bate Court. M. 8. Wagy, who is interest
ed with Lamberson and Bacigalupi. filed
a complaint in intervention to checkmate
Drinkhouse and his frientis. The time for
answering that suit has not yet expired.
Attorney Ruef. representing Drinkhouse.
says that he will have but little trouble
in knocking out the claims of McKenzie
and the others. In the meantime McKen
zie â¢ and j his associates ! are preparing â¢ to
drill the land, in the expectation of; strik
ing oil with but little cost.

The version of the Interview accepted in
political Â¦ circles says that Daniels as a
preliminary, step to peace negotiations
proposed that Dingee should relieve the
newspaper of a trifling obligation of $55,
000 owing to a bank with which the capi
talist of the water company is closely
connected. Mr. Dingee understood 'that
Mr. Daniels wanted the indebtedness
liquidated, lifted, canceled, or, in common
parlance, paid ' off. so that it would not
figure on the books of the bank or any
other books as a liability 'of Journalism.
It is related to The Call that Mr. Dingee
entertained in a friendly spirit the over
tures of the plausible Mr. Daniels, but
that the newspaper man stipulated . so
many immediate and ironclad provisions
in regard to the liquidation that the cap
italist asked time to confer with his con
science and his associate directors.
ARE PREPARING
TO SINK FOR OIL
" The municipal contest in Oakland is en
livened by talk of extortion; blackmail
and other topics which may awaken the
attention of voters. The water fight is
always an element in Oakland city elec
tions, rand -this time it is taking first
place. The story com* to The Call that
W. J. Dingee of the water company Is
declaring with spirit and vehemence that
the . Enquirer's course in assailing "him
was inspired by his refusal to pay the
paper's bank obligations, amounting to
555,000. The story goes that George C.
Pardee and Henry Dalton recently sug
gested to- Dingee that he should get in
line for Felton. Taylor, chairman of the
Council, and thereby win the good will of
the Enquirer In the fight to fix water
rates. For the purpose of bringing about
what Mayor -Phelan would be pleased to j
term an "understanding," Mr. Dingee was
advised to see Mr. Daniels, manager of the
Enquirer, and hold a parley on politics.
It is asserted that Mr. Dingee. who at
some times is an advocate of peace and
at all times a promoter of liberal rates
for water supplied by his company to
Oakland consumers, accepted the sug
gestion for a conference and . signified
readiness to meet Mr. Daniels or any
other journalist with an olive branch.
Mr. Dingee began to reflect, and during
the progress of reflection the sum of $55,000
seemed to grow larger In his mind's
eye. It was . $1,000 ' : multiplied fifty-five
times. He began to cherish the hope
that peace at a smaller figure might serve
the ends of a water company, and while
he was entertaining that delightful . Illu
sion, he was - stunned by the sight of a
cartoon. It miist.be borne. In mind that
cartoons produce telling effect, but it must
be an exceptionally good one that \ will
produce $55,000. The first one in the En
quirer had no effect on Mr. Dingee. { The
second one did not disturb his serene, mind
or tranquil conscience, but the succeeding
avajanche of pictures, with explanatory
reading, caused him to forget all desiro
for peace and prepare for Â¦war. On- the
Oakland boat, just off Goat Island, Mr.
Dingee declared. war on the Enquirer, Its
manager/Daniels, and its financial back
ers, Pardee and Dalton. He did not hesi
tate to assert that the cartoons were pro
duced because he did not lift {he $55,000
debt. Blackmail and extortion were terms
freely used before the ferry boat reached
the pier.
The Call, desiring to ascertain if the
war was to be long: contested and bitterly
fought to the finish, sought an interview
with Mr. Dingee last night. He admitted
that he used high language on the boat
within three marina miles of the shore.
He said that he understood that the En
quirer and Its financial backers owed a
bank with which he is connected the sum
of $55,000. He indicated clearly that he had
been attacked, assailed and cartooned be
cause he declined to serve the Enquirer
and Its backers, and continued:
"Say nothing about the affair at pres
ent. In a few days 1 will make a state
ment that will enlighten the public as to
the cause of the attacks."
When seen last nl&ht. Dr. Pardee said:
"As far as I am concerned, it is a cock
and bull story, about which I know noth
ing.' As for Mr. Danielsâ he must speak
for himself. I know nothing- about his
affairs."
