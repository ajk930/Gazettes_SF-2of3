he was prepared to swear to It.

near the shoulder blade. Another bullet
had entered the fleshy part of the left

The disorder of the room and the

The husband evidently suspected some

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.-The opposition
of the European powers will prevent the
consideration of the question of indemnity
and revision of commercial treaties with
China by an International commission, as
suggested by President- McKinley. In
urging that these matters be discussed by
the powers direct. Minister Conger in
formed the State Department ' that they
could be settled by the Ministers in
Peking only with the greatest difficulty.
The disinclination of the powers to accept
the proposition for the appointment of a
commission has caused the President to
withdraw it and the -Ministers In Peking
will be directed to make an effort to reach
an agreement. It is explained that the
proposition submitted by the President to
transfer the negotiations of Indemnity ami
commercial treaties to some other place
than Peking was designed to facilitate the
conclusion of negotiations as a whole by
separating those still requiring consider
able deliberation from those already de
termined. â¢ Some of the powers did not
look with favor upon this separation and
others hesitated to decide the question.
Desiring abo've all else to avoid delay in
the progress of negotiations, the President
has directed Mr. Conger to urge their
early completion at Peking. The other
governments also have been* urgently re
quested to avoid all unnecessary delay In
completing a settlement of the Chinese
question.

of Anglomania that influences Austria's
foreign policy, repeats with an air of
believing in the Dally Telegraph's state

to leave the concert of the powers in

VOLUME LXXXIX-XO. 42.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.Lieutenant Governor Neft avers that the
attitude of Senators in the prolonged con
test for United States Senator had no
bearing whatever on his Judgment mak
ing up the standing committees of the
Senate. He further asserts that there
was no thought of Ignoring the wishes of
Governor Gage and distinctly says the
Governor made no suggestion concerning
the assignments of Senators to committee
duty.
The chickens which Governor Gage re
leased from his coop when he opened the
fight in Pcndleton's behalf will come back
to roost in the executive office. The story
1b going the rounds to-night that Alden
Anderson was slated for the "WayB and
Means Committee, but that a change was
made" In the programme at tho suggestion
of the Governor. This business of one
branch of the State government Interfer
ing with the affairs of another is any
thing but commendable, and is sure to
produce bad results. The Governor In his
preparations to sup with the Assembly
as now organized should procure a very
long spoon, for one who sups with the
Devil should be thus provided.
The Speaker of the Assembly ignored well
established precedent in the formation of
the Ways and Means Committee. In or
der to preserve the credit of the State
the Senate may be Impelled to take the
initiative In financial legislation.
The natural consequence of the blunder
In the appointment of Fisk will be to
transfer to the Senate FinanceiCommit
tee the important duties of handling the
appropriation bills. . Precedent in legisla
tive affairs constitutes the only authority
for giving to tho. Assembly the initiative in
lrgislation to provide ways" and means for
meeting the'- expense of State government.
In order to gratify mean and narrow
prejudice because they would not live up
under. the colors of Boss Kelly, John
Lynch, Jere Burke and Eddie Conroy to
the support of Pendleton for the Speaker
ship they were insulted. and igrnored. It
Is almost as Cfertain, however, as day fol
lows night "that the people at the next
election will' return these Assemblymen to
the Legislature'- by increased majorities.
The appointment of Arthur G. Fisk to
the chairmanship of the Ways and Means
Committee is 'absurd and , inexcusable.
Even the bosses who have not reached a
degree" of total depravity In politics are
inclined to apologize for the Speaker's se
lection and pass up the responsibility to
Governor; Gage, who Is. said to have sig
nified a, wish that a young man should be
chosen for the place. Kisk is without leg
islative experience.- He possesses no spe
cial capacity for the character of work
assigned to him. .If Gage wants to take
the credit ' of. Fisk's selection he will not
find any one anxious to deprive him of his

â¢svranple ovrr just how tho bills would po
in and then, after it had been decided â¢
that each Senator should submit all tho ]
1 .ills he had when his name wa^ called on
the roll, the roll was called and the bills
tomniencfd to flow in.
There were four primary laws In the
bunch; one from Uurnett. another from
< "utter, a third from Davis and a fourth
frr,m I>evlin. Burnett's is practically the
law, minus pome of the things
that broujrht an adverse decision from the
Fuprrme Court as to its constitutionality
and with a few new features added. The
most important of the new features is a
provision for the payment of officers of
the primary elections as well as those of
the general elections and at the same rate.
l>Â«"vliu's bill is also based upon the main
!Â«Â»atures of the Stratton law, except that
a different test is required to ascertain
the voter's politics.
The Davis law provides this as the party
test: "The voter must be aeked by the
ballot clerk and mu^t state the name of
the party whose ticket he desires to vote.
The ballot clerk thall then, as a party
test, ask him this question and none
other: "Do you indorse the principles of
the party which you have named, accord
ing to the most recent declaration of Us
j;rincinles by the hi^'lifst authority in tha f .
party?' I'pon receiving an affirmative aji
nrcr thereto and doi otherwise he shall
be furnished the orticial ballet of that
party and permitted 14 vote thtreon; and
he Fhall not be permitted to vote any
other party ballot at that election."
Educational bills were also numerous.
Simpson submitted one to equalize the
courses of Ftudy in cities and towns and
in country districts; also to make it more
practical and less wearing- on young
pcholars. Taylor submitted a number of
bills, the result of the last biennial con
ference of County Superintendents, which
regulate various minor questions as to
the time of the appointment of teachers,
their certificates, the duties of county
boards and the length of the contracts,
one bill proviÂ«3Â«rs> that -contracts with
teachers shall be pnterr-d into yearly, a
<!ause that was "bitterly opposed by the
teachers of San Francisco at the last Bes-
Mon. because it was believed it endan
gered thoir tenure of office. In the pres
ent measure?, however, it is expressly
provided that thÂ£ yearly contract clause
shall not be operative In counties or cities
having Hoards of Education, which
places San Francisco beyond the provi
hions of the bill.
Simpson submitted a bill prohibiting the
manufacture, sale or giving away of cig
arettes.
I^eavitt submitted the report of the spe
cial committee of Senators appointed to
investigate the State Priuting Office. It
hss beea outlined In The Cull. He also
submitted a bill appropriating $GtÂ».000 for
new machinery, another making the State
Printer an jippoinlive. Instead of a'l elec
tive office and a third .fixing the wages
j.ald in the office, at the highest average
union wages paid on the outside.
The threo constitutional amendments
ere by I-ardner. Taylor and Cutter. Tay
lor's is that exempting State and munici
pal bonds from taxation. Cutter's pro
vides that social entertainments in
< hurchos for the benefit of the church will
not deprive them of the privileges of ex
emption from taxation. This was over
looked In the amendment adopted by the
people at the last election, and. unless it
goes through it will practically nullify the
amendment now in force.

CALL. KEADQTTARTKRS. SAC
RAMENTO, Jan. 10.â The an
nouncement by Speaker Pendlc
ton of his standing committees
aroused the Assembly this after
ncon from the lethargy into Â¦which the
non-activity of the week had thrown it.
Members sat listening intently while
Clerk Lloyd read through the list, #ind
when he had completed and the Assem
bly had adjourned the sole topic of con
versation was the character of the com
binations into committees made by the
Speaker in his already famous all night
conferences with John C. Lynch, Jere
Burke and Eddie Conroy.
Kelly's most pliant tools in the Assem
bly were delighted with the result. Al
den Anderson's supporters In the Speak
ershlp fight were not disappointedâ they
expected nothing and got nothing. The
members who yielded to pressure from
various sources and voted for Pendleton.
more or less under protest, now Baw the
first sheaves of the harvest of what they
had sown, were disappointed in the com
mittees and alarmed for the future. Few
could be found who would assert that
the choice of Fisk for chairman of the
..ays and Means Committee was any
thing but the shameless carrying out of
a bargain and preparation for boss con
trol of the State's purse-strings. None
but the bosses and tneir tools lind cauw
for^atisfaction in the appointment of a
new and untried member to the chair
manship of the most important of all thj
committees.
It is significant that Broughton, tho
Los Angeles running mate of the Speake*.
i.s made chairman of the Committee on
Corporations, where cinch bills are made
or .stopped. The Committee on Com
merce and Navigation is headed by
Brady of San Francisco â "Colonel" Brady
of the tenderloin districtâ and Kelly ruos
his hands in glee.
Franklin of San Franciscoâ "Kelly's
own," who sneezes when the boss takes
snuff and is proud to do itâ is chairman of
the Committee on engrossment and En
rollment.
Numerous others in i the list of chair
men are distinguished! chiefly for lack of
fitness for anything Jn general, and in
particular of the leadership accorded
them. A number of the ablest member.-,
the men who have made the best records
in past sessions, were ignored by the
Speaker.
Meliek gets nothing but places on three
unimportant committees. Knowland,
chairman last session of the important
Commerce and Navigation Committee. l*Â»
not even given a place upon it this time.
Atherton of Marln i.s not placed on
either the' Dairies and Dairy Products
Committee or the State Prisons and Re
formatory Institutions Committee, though
ho was entitled to UÂ»e chairmanship of
one and membership on the other.
Anderson of Solano is made chairman of
the Committee on Commissions and Pub
lic Expenditures.
The San Francisco delegation, Kelly s
nucleus got a chairmanship for each man
and yet Is not satlshed. Collins is dis
gusted because he gets an unimportant
chairmanship instead of Brady's chance
on â¢ the Commerce and Navication Com-
Brown, Guilfoyle. Evatt. Hourigan and
Henry say little, but contemplate with
poorly concealed disgust the reward giv
en to Fisk and Bradv for the services of
the bunch. Macbeth, Bauer, Treadwell
and Knight have already quit training
with the others and now that a new ele
ment of discord has arisen the "solid
fourteen" seems completely disrupted.
The morning session was very brief.
The joint resolution, introduced in the
Senate yesterday, thanking the members
of the State Relief Committee for the
Galveston sufferers, was introduced by
Kelley and adopted. The report of tho
Committee on Mileage was adopted. Ad
journment was taken to < p. m. to permit
the Speaker to finish making: out his
standins committees.
The special committee appointed to seg
regate the different portions of the Gov
ernor's message presented its report at
the afternoon cession. According to rec
ommendations, the bubonic plague section
was referred to the Committee on Fed
eral Relations. All matters referring to
the University of California, including
the subdivision treatv of Stanford Uni
versity, were referred to a SDeclal com
mittee to be "appointed for that purpose,
and the sections on "primary law" to lha
Committee on Elections. Ten other seg
regations were assigned to various com

by Cowan, Sutro, Sheridan and Feliz, but

agreed upon.
Although it does not describe their dis
tricts, the bill gives San Francisco the
full complement of nine Senators which
to some extent relieves the apprehension
of the San Francisco delegation over the
rumor that one of the city Senators would
be taken away.
Cutter, chairman of the Apportionment
Committee, will call the committee to

VANCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 10.â The en
tire mainland of British Columbia is
enowbound. Such a condition Is not un
usual in the Rocky Mountains during the

coast, where there is rarely more than an
inch or two of snow two or three days
throughout the entire winter!
Snow began falling ten days ago and has
continued intermittently ever since. The
snow is now about three feet deep on the
level on the streets. Snow plows and
gangs of men with shovels have been con
stantly employed endeavoring to keep
clear the tracks of the electric trams, but
even with these efforts it has been impos
sible to give the usual service. Despite
the unfavorable conditions, the trains of
the Canadian Pacific Company have con
tinued to run on schedule time. To-day
the storm began again with renewed vigor
and snow fell the greater part of the day.
A storni broke this morning from the
east.
The steamer Joan, from Nana!mo, and
other coast vessels were late, reporting
exceedingly rough weather in the Gu!f of
Georgia. Smaller steamers are all now
snowbound.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â The general
debate on the river a^sd harbor bill con
tinued in the House until 4 o'clock, when
the death of Representative Clarke of
New Hampshire was announced and the
House adjourned out cf respect to his
memory.
The feattires of the debate to-day were
the speeches of Cushman of Washington
and Hepburn of Iowa, The latter his
been a persistent opponent of river and
harbor bills for yearÂ«, and he attacked
the bill all along the line in his usualiy
vigorous fashion.
Cushman's speech was unique fn many
Ttarticulars. He was in favor of river and
harbor apprcpriatlons, and his complaint
f.as due to the fact that the members of
the committee, according to his ideas,
ha<f located the bulk of the appropriations
in their own States and had given scant
attention to the needs of other Statesâ
especially to the Seattle ehip canai in his
own State. Cushman Illustrated his re
marks with a series of carefully prepared
charts. He criticized fc everal of the indi
vidual members of '.he commitMse in
breezy style., and became engaged in a
half dozen very spirited encounters be
fore he concluded. Members crowdci
about t*Â»e area in front of the Speaker's
desk, where he stood explaining the fig
ures upon the charts, and every one
eeemed to enjoy the picturesque perform
ance immensely. When he wound up with
& glowing appeal for justice to the SeattlÂ°

UNIQUE ADDRESS
NEW INDUSTRY
IN FAR NORTH
Steamer Ruth Carries Cargo
of Polecats to Shakan
1 Island.
Thirty Passengers Forfeit Their
Ticket Money Rather Than
Sail 'With the IXetested
Animals.
Ei>eclal Dispatch, to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. lO.-William
Hooker, an Alaska pioneer and the-pro
prietor of one of the largest polecat farms
in the East, leaves for the north to-night
on the steamer Ruth with 100 skunks with
which to stock Shakan Island. Mr.
Hooker will go into the business of rais- :
ing the detested animals on several isl
ands along the Alaskan coast for their
valuable furs. He says the climate is well
suited to, their culture. He expressed the
opinion to-day that within a few years the
business will be one of Alaska's most Im
portant sources of revenue outside the'
gold output.
A peculiar feature of the shipment is
the fact that at least thirty passengers
who had taken passage on the Ruth have
forfeited their ticket money and say they
will take another vessel.
In speaking of his plan the owner of the
skunks states that he intends to have a
regular farm on a claim which he pos
sesses on the island, and that he will on
this farm have the stock fenced- in In
such a manner as to protect them from
the attacks of larger animals and to keep
them from wandering and themselves
from committing any depredations. It is
a well known fact that the skunk is, when
properly dealt with, easily domesticated
and soon becomes as gentle and playful
as a kitten.
The fur of the animal is thick and glossy
and never fails to bring a fair price when
taken in the proper season. . j #Â¦
If the experiment of stcckingVtne place
with these animals proves a supcess there
is little doubt that skunk farming will be- Â¦
come the dominant industry of Shakan I
Island.
SITKA'S CAPITOL
NEARLY BURNED
Famous Greek Church Also
Has Very Narrow Escape
From Dastruction.
Special pispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Jan. 10.â On top of the In
dian outbreaks, assassinations and other
troubles, the inhabitants of Sitka
have been .treated to a fire which
threatened to wipe out the entire town.
Had it not been for the determined fight
made by the marines and the Indians from
the Mission School, Alaska would have
been without a capitol. The fire took
place on January 2 and at a time when
a high wind was blowing. Sparks were
carried in all directions with the result
that no sooner was one building saved
from destruction than another was dis
covered to be on fire.
The famous Greek church would surely
have been consumed had not a special
guard stood around the sacred edifice dur
ing the danger period and quickly extin
guished the flames as soon as they began
to make their presence felt. Four times
did the fchurch catch fire, but each time
it was saved.
The fire started in a carpenter shop
among some shavings where oil had been
spilled. The presumption is that some
one carelessly dropped a mate, after
lighting a pipe. Several buildings were
destroyed, and Captain J. H. Pendleton.
who had charge of the fire brigade, was
severely burned. Several members of the
department were more* or less injured.
Several hours of fighting ensued before
the city was saved from threatened de
struction.
The local fire department, fifty-six ma
rines and the Indians, formed the fire
fighting force. The loss is estimated at
about $6000, with no insurance.

CAHTO, Jan. 10.â News of a most re

here by Superintendent Crosby of the Iron

yesterday and states while crossing Sig
nal Peak early yesterday morning he
found a tal!, well-built man standing nude
on the summit of the mountain. The man
was posing as a statue and looking into

there so long that his flesh was fairly blue

until another traveler crossing the peak
induced him to dress, and he was then
taken to a near-by town and locked up.
He gave his name as William Feeney. It
was later learned that Feeney had visited
the Iron Mountain Mining Company's
mines and had slept in one of the bunk
housrs the previous night, but became so
noisy crying out that he had never killed

On the sixth day of November, while

Fhow thÂ»Â»:r preference, and Candidate
Bryan scored a notable victory, recelv
injr more than three votes to President
McKinley's nue. The vote for Bryan vas
SS-'xi. while McKinley's vote was only 800.
The Klondikers had an object in ho'lding
their election, and Mr. Bryan will receive
a handsome plate of the purest gold which
the Klondike can produce. In the event
nf the election of Mr. McKlnley at the
Pawson polls he would have been pre

the plate is known. The souvenir is now
on exhibition in the window of a Daw

LIFE IN ORDER TO SAVE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENDANGERED

WEST POINT, NT. T., Jan. 10.â Before
the members of the Congressional inves
tigating committee resumed their in
quiries to-day Into the charges of hazing
at the Military Academy they visited the
camp grounds at Port Clinton, where
many fights between cadets have oc
curred. Colonel Clayton, who Is a gTad
uate of the academy, explained the ar
rangements of the tents in the summer
encampments to his brother committee
men, and when they visited the rink in
the rear of the camp the "stretching" pro
cess, by which several cadets were hazed,
was discussed.
Cadet William R. Bettlson of Kentucky
was the first witness. He testified that
Cadet Breth was his classmate and that
Cadet Booz waa a fourth class man,
while he (the witness) was a third class
man. He never knew of Breth being
hazed. The witness said he knew of five
fights between cadets during his first
year and was present at two of them.
Witness said that there were nine fights
during the year 1899-1900 and seven during
the present year. Bettlson recalled the
names of the participants in nearly all of
these fights. He said none of these fights
had been investigated by the authori
ties, and consequently no one had been
punished. He had never been a prin
cipal in a fight, but had officiated at Bev
*-ral, Bnd was the chairman of the "scrap
ping committee," which decided when a
fight was to be arranged.
Bettlson described the fights as bare
knuckle affairs, under Marquis of Queens
berry rules, except that the rounds were
two minutes each. He said the principals
stripped to the waist and fights were
usually to a finish.
"Then you here hold fights of a brutal
nature, which the laws of forty out of
forty-five States in the Union have pro
hibited?" said Mr. Driggs.
Bettison made no reply.
Mr. Driggs then inquired If hazing or
c^sistlni; at hazing cadets was violating
the oath administered to a cadet on hia
entrance to the academy. After some
evasion the witness said that violations of
the academy regulations were not con
piderfd by the cadets as violations of the
articles of war and were not looked upon
as military disobedience.

TWO OF THE ilEMBERS OP THE COMMITTEE WHO MADE THE AR
RANGEMENTS. FOR THE INTERESTING CEREMONY OF INSTALL
ING EIGHTY ELECTED CHIEFS OF THE RED MENC
"English , Catholics, however, do not at
present concern themselves very much
about such- matters, unless, which I hard
ly think possible, the utterances of the
Duke of Norfolk in Rome might begin to
stir English public opinion. One thing is
certain, however, and that is that Leo
XIII will be very much pleased that his
pet wishes have JTound an echo in the
words of the most Dromlnent member of
the English nobilitv."
"As to the effect of any assertion of tho
rights of the Pope to temporal power, it
is hard to make any prediction. Perhaps
the Pope wishes that some sort of foreign
pressure be exercised on the Italian Gov
ernment to make it relinquish the domin
ion of at least the city of Rome to the
Holy See. It is persistently rumored in
Rome and abroad that the outcome of the
present agitation will be the definition of
the necessity of the temporal power of the
Pope as a dogma of the Roman Catholic
faith and in that case all Catholics will
be obliged to admit the doctrine and do
their utmost for the return to the Pope of
a temporal sovereignt*'.
"I am afraid" that tl-o Duke has stirred
up a hornet's nest. ', L am an Italian my
self and, having "resided in Rome for a
long time, I know well the susceptibilities
of the Italians In regard to a>ny utter
ances which might advocate. or imply the
destruction of united Italy.- The- speech
of the Duke at the reception of the Eng
lish pilgrims at the Vatican, coming: as
it does from .a prominent, member of the
British aristocracy',- s,innot-. but excite
their feelings. and I snould not be sur
prised if violence was to be offered tho
English visitors to the Eternal City on
this account, as was the case of the
French pilgrims in 1S2J.
"Up to the present time the Italians
have always considered the English peo
ple and their Government in sympathy
with the efforts they have made toward
the independence rand unification of their
country, which could not possibly have
been obtained without the disappearance
of the temporal power of the Pope.
"Just now," said the speaker, "the Pope
has insisted that, foreign prelates and
prominent Catholics should take up the
advocating and defending of such rights
to temporal power and the recent utter
ances of Archbishop Ireland and of Cardi
nal Vaughan amply testify to this fact.
"Personally, the Duke Is not concerned
if the Pope l^as lost his temporal power.
He has always been an earnest admirer of
the Italian people and of their efforts at
unity and Independence. His present visit
to Rome at the head of the English pil
grimage is a kind of reparation for hl3
and the English Catholics' neglect during
the holy year. In the whole course of
which no English representation of the
Catholic church visited Rome and the
Pope. ' ,

NETV YORK. Jan. 10.â Believing that
they were the victims of "praveyard" in
surance swindlers, officers of the Colonial
Life Insurance Company of America, lo
cated In Jersey City, to-day caused the
arrest of Thomas Martin, editor of . a
Union Hill (N. J.) newspaper; William
Nitker. aa undertaker in Union Hill, and
Thomas J. Kelly, a pugilist, whose right
name Is said to b* Thomas Waldron and
who until recently was an agent for the
company. Dr. Richard Jaher. a West
lloboken phyeiclan and formerly the
m.edlcaJ exaxnlner In Union Hill for the
company, went to police headquarters,
but, after making a statement, was not
placed under arrest. Secretary and Man
eser Ernest Hoppenhelmer of the insur
ance company eald be did not think Dr.
Jaher had been guilty of criminal Intent,
but he had been careless in signing papers
presented by Kelly.
Martin, Kelly and Necker were each re
leaped on J1000 bail. An Indictment has
been found against the four men upon the
charge tha.t they had conspired to secure
The insurance upon the life of Robert
Brenner, a boy of 17, who was the
brother of Martin's wife. The insurance
Â¦vvas secured In August last when Bren
ner wa* an Inmate of Bellevue Hospital.
Manin was the beneficiary. Brenner's ap
plication had been secured by Kelly as
aeent ; he had been examined -and passed
ty Dr. Jaher ar.d his body had been burled
by Neeker. the undertaker. It was
charged that Brenner was dying with con
sumption when the policy was granted.
Manager Horpenhcimer said that Kelly,
while agent of the company. J*ad taken
very bad risks on which the company had
paid monev to Neeker and Martin as bene
nciarles. He said that three cases had
been found In which KeMy and the others
had defrauded the company. It was be
lieved there were other cases. The com
pany had noticed a high death rate among
the persons insured by Kelly and refused
to insure Brenner for more than CS2. The
policy was made out by Kelly for JiSl.
When Brenner died in October last, soon
after the policy was secured, the company
started an investigation of Agent Kelly's
work and poon afterward dismissed him
ar.d Dr. Jaher.
Mr. Hoppenheimer also said that one of
the men insured by Kelly had been In
Bellevue HoFpital shortly before the in
eurance was placed and died soon after
ward. One case was eo flagrant that the
company heard of It and Neeker, having
reason to fear trouble, accepted a return
if the premium. In this case the policy
wa* for Â£1000. In the other suspected
cases the insurance was for smaller
amounts. The company canceled several
policies written by Kelly on persons who
have since died of lingering diseases.
It is paid that the Colonial Insurance
Company has been Fwindled out of large
sums of money secured on bogus policies

In the Assembly lobby when Speaker Pen
dleton announced the standing commit
tees. Whatever onlnion others may en
tertain regarding | the unworthiness and
unfltnes- of the various assignments, the
fact Is significant that j Boss Kelly gives
his unreserved commendation of the ap
pointments. Kelly strenuously . denies
that ' a bargain -was entered | Into before
the Palace Hotel conference was held. He
Insists that the San Francisco bunch had
such implicit confidence in Pendleton that
no pledges were exacted. Â«Â¦ ,Â¦- -
The announcement recently made In The
Call to the effect that the Speaker " had
been elected to membership In the Good
Government Club,' 1 of which Sam Ralney
is president and Martin Kelly 'secretary.
Is declared to.be premature; Ralney was
here yesterday and looked -the Speaker
over, but- the subject of his election- was
postponed until * after - the announcement
of the Btanding: committees. .It will now
be ; considered and the Speaker's election
Is recarded'as certain. - Â¦Â¦- â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. .

Ng Yip Hoy. an old Chinese, who lived
at the corner of Bakers alley and Dupont
street, committed suicide last night under
peculiar circumstances. Hoy was a la
borer, but on account of sickness had been
unable to work for some time past. George
Downey, a special officer in Chinatown,
visited the sick man. and finding him des
titute and friendless decided to send him
to a hospital that he might receive atten
tion. While on his way to arrange for his
removal Downey saw the Chinaman jump
from the three-story building in which he
lived to the pavement in Bakers allev.
The man was still breathing when Dow
ney went to his aid, though he was bleed
ing profusely from a deep gash in his
head. The Receiving Hospital ambulance
was Font for. but before it arrived the
man was dead. The bodv was removed
to the Morgue.
The Chinese custom when a man is
about to die 16 to have him removed to an
undertaker, where he may pass his last
hours. Hoy evidently desired to avoid
the unpleasant waiting: period and deter
mined to end his sufferings at once.

which will conveve on January 39, 1901,'.
While the foregoing .advertisement has
not been published in the columns of the
local papers. Secretary Scott would like
the residents of this State to know that a
worthy man is wanted to represent the
chamber at this important conference.
The distance between here and Bruns
wick, Ga., is many miles and the railroad
fare is high, and at this season of the year
the members of the organization neither
have the time nor inclination to undertake
the journey. Rather man have the In
vitation extended by C. D. Ogg, secretary
of the Brunswick Board of Trade,

who is going Kast to call upon Secretary
Scott and receive crÂ«lentials.
The congress is called by Governer A. D.
Candler of Georgia to discuss and sug

this country and . building a merchant
marine worthy of the nation. .The con

Impressed with the Importance of creating an
interest in the maritime business of the United

In the interest, thereforej of patriotism and
the commercial welfare of i the citizens of the
United States, I trust the object of this call
will receive that consideration from those wIm
feel an interest in the promotion of the.mari
time greatness of our ; country to which its

The action by which Armlda Bertocchi
seeks a decree of divorce from Glovann'
Bertocchi on the ground of cruelty is on
triar before Judge Troutt. The litigants
are prominent In Italian society, Mrs.
Bertocchi being a sister-in-law of G. Cos
ta, a director In a local Italian bank and
well known In the financial world.
Mrs. Bertocchi, who was corroborated
by Mr. Costa, testified that her husband,
habitually treated her in a cruel manner
and stinted her In their household ex
penses. Frequently, she testified, her hus
band left her 10 cents to purchase neces
saries for the day and when she expostu
lated he would instilt her. On one occa
sion, she testified, he struck her on tho
face, and again, in September last, drove
her from their home.
Bertocchi took the stand in hia own de
fense and complained that his wife fre
ouentlv drank and waa negligent in hav
ing his meals ready for "im. Further
hearing of the case was continued until
this mornlnz. -~
The action by -which Donald J. Standish
sought a decree annulling his marriage to
Pauline Standlsh on the ground that the
same was invalid by reason of having
been solemnized In Nevada In violation of
the California law prohibiting divorcees
from remarrying within one year from
the date of the decree, was dismissed yes
terday. A reconciliation has been effected
between the litigants, it is said.
Decrees of divorce were granted yester
day to Angela Devincenzi from Emello
Devincenzl for cruelty: Mary J. Booth
from George H. Booth for willful neglect,
and Stephen M. Katzer from Annit Katzer
for infidelity.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday

1 - va STRELLA WILMOTT, the former
I u sweetheart cf the Inimitable
â¢"^ "Teddy" Hartman, has returned
|l to San Francisco after an ab
senco of several years. She is
billed to appear before the footlights at
the Alhambra Sunday evening In Thall &
Kennedy's latest success, "A Stranger In
a Strange Land."
Miss Wilmott will be remembered as
a former member of the Tivoll Company
here, and before she went East it was
said she would soon become Mrs. Hart
man, but It now appears that the affec
tions of the two were' but a temporary
fancy, for Miss Wilmott comes back to
San Francisco as the wife of Charles De
land, who is also a member of the cast
of "A Stranger in a Strange Land." Miss
Wilmott has a host of friends here and
she will doubtless be accorded a warm re
ception.
THEY "BEAT THE BARRIE'R."
"Nell Gwynne."
Alcazar Filled by Actors Who ; Hear
The "professional matinee" at the Al
cazar Theater yesterday afternoon was a
great success. The house was full, of
"skulls," signifying that nearly every one
occuplng a seat had "beaten the barrier."
They had interviewed Louis Morganstern
at the box office and had established
themselves as actoft or actresses and
were accordingly" extended the courtesies
of the house.
As early as 1 o'clock O'Farrell street
bee-an to present the appearance of New
York's "Rlalto." The news had been
posted on the boards ofr the local theate-a
that- a performance of "The Adventures
of Nell Gwynne" was to be produced for
the special benefit of the actor folk, and
the players of all degrees responded. There
was the young man with the long hair
and the long coat who saye one line.
BERT0CCHI MAKES
COUNTER CHARGES
"Back to the mines, you dogs," in "Dark
est Russia"; the young lady who is
taking elocution lessons and thinks she
Is already a Sara B., and the actor who
has played "Juveniles" with several barn
storming companies and proudly declares
that he never yet had to wire home for
his ticket.
One man who looked like aof antedilu
vian cardriver blew up to the box office.
"Did he belong to the profession?"
"Well, he liked that. He handled 'props*
with Mark Thall in the old Bush thirty
years ago." He was followed by a young
man who was out at the knees. "Yes, he
was an actor, and he never worked for
less than three figures a week"; and so
the stream continually poured into the
theater. They were all happy and vigor
ously applauded every scene, the men at
the close of each act going into the lobby
and with their hatchets knocking the
performance harder than the stage hands*,
who were nailing up trees and moon ef
fects.
In the second act when the bad men
exclaim, "Hark, they come: we will es
cape to the woods," a messenger boy who
had oozed into the showhouse was heard
to remark, "It's all off; they have made
to the tall and uncut timbers," and he
was scowled down by those around him
and held, to be in very bad form.
One actor arrived late. He presented his
card to the box office and asked for a
seat on the "prompt" side of the house.
He explained that he was used to "that
side and from force of habit would bs
very nervous if not in close proximity
to the man who filled the memory lapses.
He was given a seat in a box and from
his frequent mutterings appeared to be
on good speaking terms with himself. He
was asked how he enjoyed the perform
ance, and with a frozen glare stated that
San Francisco was not prepared for
cold weather or good acting."
One young lady purchased a seat and
explained that though she could not b^
an actress she hoped to be at least a cor
rect listener, and wanted to learn how
the profesh behaved -themselves when
witnessing a performance. >
Glen Ellen Horn? Is Full and Other
Charitable Institutions Decline
to Take Her.
Secretary M. J. White of the Children's
Society is in a quandary. He has on his
hand3 pretty little Irene Lenehan, whom
he is unable to place in any one of the
many charitable institutions of this city
because she is feeble-minded. His only
hope of placing, the little one In an Insti
tution for the feeble-minded was dissi
pated yesterday, when he was informed,
that the home at Glen Ellen was over
crowded and had a long waiting list.
Irene is the daughter of John Lenehan,
who lives at 313 Mateo street. Her mother
is alleged to have run away last January
and the father is said to be unfit to care
for the child. The unfortunate child is
being cared for by the society, but Secre
tary White is weighed down with respon
sibility, as he must find a permanent home
for her. It is thought that with proper
care and treatment the little girl can be
cured of her affliction. She Is healthy
and possesses some intelligence.
The Legislature, now in session, will be
asked to pass a measure similar to the
one adopted at the last session, appropri
ating" money for the enlargement of the
Eldredge Home for Feeble-minded at Glen
Kllen. The Governor vetoed that meas
ure.

ESTRELLA WILMOT, WHO RETURNS TO SAN FRANCISCO AS A BRIDE
AND A MEMBER OF THE "STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND" COM
PANY." â¢ ;
In appreciation of twenty-five years of
untiring: labor devoted to the cause of
love and mercy, a room in the Children's
Hospital was yesterday dedicated to Alr^.
W. B. Harrington, who is now serving an
president of the board of managers. The
scene at the dedication., which took place
at the close of the regu:ar annual meeting
of the^board, which was held yesterday,
was exceedingly pathetic. It was all a
surprise to the worthy recipient and she
could not find words to respond to the
dedication speeches of Mrs. L. L. Dunbar
and Mrs. "W. T. Fonda. Her snence, how
ever, evinced her feelings more clearly
than words. A panel on which Mrs. Har
rington's name has been exquisitely
carved will be placed above the door. :
Yesterday the hospital completed the
twenty-fifth year of iis existence. It has
grown from an insignificant structure on
Taylor street, with deficient equipments,
to its present magnificent size and equip
ment. The last year has been an ex
tremely prosperous one for the Institution.
Appreciation of the stability of. the hospi
tal has materially increased. This la
shown in the increase in the number of
bequests. Extensions have been madP to
the hospital buildings. A wing has been
added to the surgical department and a
home for the use of forty-five nurses has
been built.
During: the year $51,227 95 was expended
and a little over $20,000 was received from
patients. The bequests and donations
amounted to more than $0000 and six me
morial beds were endowed. More than
10.000 patients were treated, 601 of which
were children, of whom one-half were in
digent. It is the rule of the hospital nev
er to turn away a patient that can pos
sibly be accommodated.
The officers who were elected to servo
during the ensuing year are as follows:
President. Mrs. W. E. Harrington; vice presi
dents, Mrs. William Hardy and Mrs. J. F.
Merrill: recording secretary. Mrs. L. L. Dun

A CHANCE TO SMILE
Among the features of our school training which
Mr. Erskine notes with special commendation are
instruction in the use of tools and the development
of patriotism. The first fits the pupil to succeed iri
life, and the second inspires him with an ambition to
do so. Of the latter feature the report says: "Great
attention is paid to teaching children to love their
country and the flag, and it is impressed upon them
that no other co'untry is so free and that their flag
represents justice and liberty wherever it flies. * * *
The careers of Americans who have risen successfully
through their labors and talents to wealth and to
prominence in science and politics are brought
prominently before the children, who are taught that
they also may beepme Rockefellers, Lincolns' or
Edisons."
This* view of our schools taken by a foreigner well
fitted to pronounce judgment upon such subjects can
hardly fail to be gratifying to Americans generally.
It'i^fen evidence. that despite the handicap of Boards
of Education which are frequently inefficient and often
corrupt, our teachers have nevertheless developed a
system of school work that is of the highest value tn
Mr. Erskine states that daring his residence in this
country he has noticed that a remarkably large num
ber of important executive positions are held by
young men, and it occurred to him that the system
of public education has something to do with the fact.
He then adds: "At my own motion I undertook to
investigate the matter. The first thing that struck
me was the large number of pupils who leave the pub-
He schools at the age of fourteen or younger and then
enter at once on the practical business of life. They
seem to be well qualified to take hold at once, and in
a few years are doing important work in a satisfac
tory way. It seemed to me there must be something
about the way they are educated which is responsible.
I was particularly impressed during my investigation
with the practical nature of the education offered.
* * * The course seems to develop their fighting
qualities, to mak'e men out of them. When they get
through they are not afraid to^ face the world; they
have a good degree of self-confidence, and they are
not content to wait for fortune to come and look
One of the latest of these critics is Thomas Erskine,
British Vice Consul at Chicago, who in a recent re
port to his Government says: "The system of edu
cation in the United States, and especially in the city
of Chicago, can be stated to be the most practical in
the world for fitting the youth of the country for the
battle of life."
SO much of American criticism upon public
schools is directed toward the jobbery, or
worse, of Boards of Education, that we fre
quently overlook the genuine excellence of the work
done in the schools. Foreign critics who note the re
sults of the training given rather than the politics of
the boards are more just in their estimates of our edu
cational system. They perceive that the work accom
plished is of a high order of merit, and attribute much
of the success of our people in industrial. and commer
cial enterprises to the influence of their school edu
cation.
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM
The evils thus pointed out by the Governor of
Pennsylvania are bad, but they are by no- means the
worst of the results of the present method'of electing
Senators. In several States the system leads to sonic
thing like a wholesale debauchery of the voters and
the legislators. The scandals of the Clark and Daly
fight in Montana have been fully exposed and are
well known. The determination of Addicks to pro
cure a seat in the Senate from Delaware has resulted
in scandals in that State hardly less notorious than
those in Montana. Governor Tunnell in his mes
sage to the Legislattue, speaking of the last election
in Delaware, says: Â¦ "Bribery, corruption and intimida
tion walked brazenly through our State at the last
election, and the only barrier in the way of. shameless
and open violation of law and decency was our pres
ent system of voting." The Governor does not say
so, but it is well understood that the bribery and the
bulldozing were done as parts of the Senatorial fight.
. The new campaign for the election of United States
Senators by direct vote of the people opens, then, with
plenty of facts to point the mÂ«ral. Moreover, an
abundance of new facts are likely to be forthcoming
from the States where Senatorial contests are to en
gage the attenticn_of. Legislatures this winter. In
many of these States the general subject of legislation
will be. almost wholly neglected by reason of the ab
sorption of the legislators in the fight for the senator
ship. Possibly we may have new scandals and new
deadlocks added to the already large number of such
offenses. The outlook, therefore, for the desired re
form is brighter than ever before. The people ars
already disgusted with the existing -method of elec
tion, and another batch of scandals will bring about
a resolution to apply the remedy.
Governor Stone. of Pennsylvania has taken the
lead in urging an amendment of the Federal constitu
tion so as to provide for the election of Senators by
direct vote of the people, fn his message to the
Legislature he has recommended the change in the
interest of the States themselves. He says: "Candi
dates for the Legislature are now too often selected
by reason of their supposed friendship or opposition
to some candidate for the United States Senate. Their
qualifications to properly legislate for the districts
which they represent are too often forgotten or ig
nored." â¢
I" >v ELAWARE and Pennsylvania are at present
I ) the storm centers of the Senatorial contests of
the year, and consequently it is natural that
from them should come the first earnest renewal of
the agitation for a change in the method of electing
Senators. There are other States, however, that in
all probability will soon unite with them in the cam
paign of education, for, according to all reports, there
are likely to be prolonged contests in Colorado, Mon
tana and Illinois.
THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
A further analyses shows that we received twice as
many Croatians and Slavonians as English, three
times as many Syrians as Scotch, as many Slovaks
;s Irish, three and a half times as many Southern
Italians and twice as many Hebrews as Germans, and
numbers of Lithuanians, Magyars and Ruthenians.
One has to go to the geography to locate these
reople.
The three principal elements in the year's acces
sion to our population were: South Italians, 84,346;
Hebrew. 60.764: Polish, 46.938; the Irish rank next/
and below them Scandinavians, 32,952, and Germans,
29.682.
As recently as 1869 our immigration from the Brit
ish Isles, France. Germany and Scandinavia was
three-quarters of the whole.
It has been said that India is a museum of races.
But if each of the many races now flocking to the
United States should preserve its national type and
remain racially isolated and non-assimil^ive,. this
country would present a greater diversity and be more
of a race museum than India.
It is a tenable theory that our institutions require
for their maintenance a homogeneous people, and it
may well be feared thit the diversity of races and na
tionalities now pouring in upon us may soon begin to
overtax our power of assimilation and produce a case
of national indigestion. The first sign of non
assimilation is the appearance of their ancestral na
tional customs and racial habits in the second and
third generations of these immigrants. Whenever we
have distinct Polish, Slovak, Croatian and Lithuanian
groups in our population the danger line will - have
been reached. It is believed by some statisticians and
observers that this already appears. In some parts of
Pennsylvania the Huns and Slavs are remaining apart
fiom each other and distinct from the American com
munity. The same is true of the Syrians and Ar
menians.
It is noteworthy that many of these nationalities,
the Huns. Magyars. Syrians, Armenians and Slavs,
are of not remote Oriental origin. They are com
mon stock with the Siberian Scythians and thi
Tartars.
It is vitally necejtary that our immigration laws be
addressed to weeding out the insane, deficient, dis
eased and indigent from this new immigration. The
British Isles, Germany and the Scandinavian states
formerly sent to us their physical, mental and moral
health. Let us see to it that these strange races do not
inoculate us with their disease and indigence.
IT is always of interest to study the immigration that
comes to this country to become a permanent part
of its population ai?d members of the body politic.
For many years the great tide of immigration was
ftom the British Isles and German3\ 'These immi
grants quickly assimilated, and in the second genera
tion became indistinguishable from the original
American stock.
About thirty years ago the Latin races began to
come, and others, the admixture of Latin and Goth.
Italy, Spain and Portugal began to send their surplus
here in search of our CTeater opportunities. We found
them a thrifty addition to our population, but less
easy of assimilation than the Celtic and German stock.
Professor Hall in the Forum has analyzed our still
more recent immigration, which presents some aston
i:hing features. Last year we received 460,000 immi
prants from Europe. Of these 100,000 were from
Austro-Hungary. joo.ooo from Russia, 40,000 only
from Ireland, 10.000 from England.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
EDITOR OF THE CALI^-In your editorial of 5th inst. you voice the sen
timent of Mr. William H. Mills repardinp the gross destruction of young for
est trees for Christmas decorations. Your plea la strong 1 and earnest and
ev(*ry thinking person must deplore with you this wanton waste. I am
prompted to offer a single suggestion as a remedy, feeling that this, to me,
quaint cuslom of Chrjstmastide need not be abolished, but instead made more
beautiful. Few of us who have experienced the delights of the Christmas
tree would care to deny like pleasures to the little ones now about us and
those yet to come, especially since a greater lesson may be iaught at the
same time. My plan would be that each, of us who values tnis old custom
possess a HvInK Christinas tree. Speakinp..from the standpoint of a practical
dendrologlst, I can say that this Is not only possible, but a simple matter a-s v.-ell.
How full of interest to see thrm grow, the pine, the spruce or the cedar.'
"How beautiful they are, all and each after their kind! What a joy for man
to stand at his door and simply look at them Krowlr.R-. leafing-, blossoming,
fruiting without pause!" "What lesson's for the children; yes. and for us.
grown folks, too! But how, you ask, are we to do and to have this? Sev
eral methods are open to us. We may take an outing to some near-by for
est. The bay counties abound In sucn as I have in mind, numerous seedlings
from one to three feet In .height may readily be found and j permission as
readily obtained to dig a crowded specimen or two, thus giving their neigh
bor more elbow room. They should be carefully dug, wi^i a ball of earth if
. possible, and the roots injured as little as possible. -and then -without delay
transplanted intp a tub or box â eight inches in diameter for an elghteen
inch specimen and a twelve-inch in diameter box or tub for a "three-foot
specimen. Or we may purchase- boxed and established specimens of various
evergreens, inclmUng the Douglass spruce, the variety commonly used for
Christmas trees, frgm almost any nursery. Sizes range from two to ten feet
and can be purchased for 50 cents per foot or even less. They are long
lived and may serve several generations. Can any of us imagine a more
â¢ beautiful custom than this may create? Our schools may also take a hand.
Let the children grow their own seedlings. "What a lesson it will teach
them, the unfoldment of the tiny plantlet. A. slow process. Yes, but none
the less valuable on that account, and the surplus? Yes. that. too. can be
put to a. good purpose. With them we may pay the debt we owe by plant
ing -where we have before received.
Will not The Call take hold and further the movement? Since It' deplores
the evil, will it not welcome a remedy? F. G. K. .
PLEA TOR LIVING CHRISTMAS TREES.
THE ghost of Mary. Queen of Scots, according to a writer in the St. Louis
Post-Dlspatyh, was heard in the bloody tower of London Tower last Christ
mas eve, and this.* according to tho tradition, means the death of the Queen
of England. The Ptory was circulated Christmas day by a guard, who
claims ho heard a long wall followed by the sound . of footsteps. Three
times was the performance repeated, and the puard, who promptly investigated
the matter, could find no cause for tho sour.ds. It is said that the spirit of the
Scottish Queen has made. Itself heard Just before the death of every monarch of
England since the time of Elizabeth. Every effort is being made to keep a
knowledge of the rumor from Queen Victoria.
Queen Mary was. beheaded oh February 8 13S7. On May 13. 1567, she had
married Bothwell, the murderer of Lord Darnley, her second husband, and Just
one month thereafter she was seized and forced to abdicate in favor of her son.
Sho escapod and fled to England, where Elizabeth confined her flrsi at Carlisle
and then In other castles. When she was led to the block she bore up bravely,
and, although only injured a little by the first blow of the ax, she made no out
cry or showed any other sign of fear. Three blows were required to cMspatch her.
It is said that Queen Elizabeth never recovered her composure after the death
of Mary, and thus just "before the death of Elizabeth the phost of the Scottish
Queen was heard walling- in the tower. This visitation, so tradition runs, has al
ways been repeated when an English monarch is about to die.
It seems to be conceded on all sides that the sala
ries now paid to high officials at Washington are too
small.- A double evil results from the parsimony. In
the first place it is not fair to ask.men of high ability
to serve the public for a sum far below what they
could earn in private business; and, m the second
place, it tends to exclude men of small means from
high office, thus making those positions something
like a monopoly for rhe rich.
The amounts proposed either by Senator Hoar for
the Justices of the Supreme Court or by Mr. Louden
slager for the Vice President and the members of the
Cabinet are certainly" not unreasonable. The people
of the United States have become the richest in the
world, and the scale and the cost of living have risen
together. From highest to lowest all. Americans
have been compelled to demand larger incomes than
sufficed men in the same class a generation ago.
There has been an increase in the wages of nearly all
kinds of labor, and in the salaries paid in almost all
scrts of private business. It is no more than right
that the nation should follow this upward movement
of its people. Washington is no longer a village, and
public officials cannot' village economies
while living there. They are required to do a much
larger amount of work than was required of their
predecessors and are justly entitled to better pay.
At the present time Federal salaries for high official*
are the lowest paid by any great nation in the world.
The President of the United States receives $50,000 a
year, while the President^ France receives $120,000.
The Vice President of the United States, who serves
as President of the Senate, receives $8000 a year, while
the Speaker of the British House of Commons re
ceives $25,000 a year and in addition has an official
residence during his term of office and a pension of
$20,000 a year for life when he retires.
Since 1874 there has been no increase made in high
official salaries. It is^ime for the nation to act more
generously and more justly to those who undertake
its most important services. It will be a bad thing
for this country if the time should ever come when the.
cost of official life will be so high and the salary so
small that none but a rich man could afford to ac-/
cept the office. We wish a Government that give-,
every citizen an equal chance for its highest offices,
and to have it so we must act upon the divine nil-,
"The workman is worthy of his hire."
j\A R. LOUDENSLAGER of New Jersey has in-
I troduced into the House a bill providing that
the salary of the Vice President of the United
Suites shall be increased to $25,000 a, year *and the
salary of each Cabinet officer to $15,000. It will, be
remembered that at the last session of Congress Sena
tor Hoar introduced a bill to increase 'the salary of
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to $15,500* a
year and the salaries of Associate Justices" to $15,000.
The two bills will doubtless be considered together,
for taken separately each is incomplete. It would be
unreasonable to increase the salaries provided for in
the one without making the increase provided for in
the other. . :

WITHIN the last twenty years there have been
painful and appalling tragedies caused by fires
in orphan and insane asylums and seminary
dormitories. The las: -one, in New York, caused the
burning to death of more than a score of orphan chil
dren.
It is time that public authority be exerted to com
pel a change in the building of orphan asylums, State
schools for incorrigible youth and insane asylums. In
none of these should the housing under one roof of
! hundreds of persons be any longer permitted. In the
case of orphans and juvenile incorrigibles there are
other objections besides the danger from fire. The
vices of adolescence' are more easily propagated when
hundreds are in one dormitory- It is a system that
permits no selection nor discrimination in association,
and by throwing all together is a means of leveling
the rna?s down to the moral plane of the least worthy
iather than raising it to that of the most worthy.
We believe that Michigan, in the State school at
Coldwatcr, was the first State to take an advance step,
and Iowa followed in the Home for Indigent Orphans
at Davenport.
The plan adopted included a central building for ad
ministration, in which were the offices, the hospital,
dining and school rooms, and chapel or assembly
room. Then cottages were built around the quad
rangle, or on regular streets, each with parlor, sitting
room, bedrooms, bath and conveniences for a family.
Each cottage is in the care of a mother, a lady who
wisely selects among the inmates those as likely to be
agreeable in association as a natural family. . Each
family in its cottage is subject to the pleasantest sur
roundings, the wisest admonition and motherly care
and advice. Out of the institution library its members
bring books to read, and all are brought within the
most excellent of influence. If one cottage burn, es
cape from it is easy, and spread of the conflag-ation
i.i unlikely. An orphan asylum or State school for
the incorrigible so planned and administered takes on
the appearance of a clean and wholesome village. Its
streets and lawns are cared for and its gardens culti
vated by the inmates. Matters of drainage and sani
tation are more easily cared for, and the whole sys
tem conduces to the moral and physical well being
of the beneficiaries.
Sometimes complaint is made that California has
five insane asylums to house her insane population of
5000. Those who complain do not stop to think of
what would follow putting those five regiments of un
fortunates all in one institution.
It may well be foreseen that our whole system of
caring for the insane will be revolutionized early in
this century. The existing plan of gathering hun
dreds of them between tlie same walls and under the
same roof will very likely pass away. The insane
aÂ«ylum of the near future will probably be built upon
the village system, with places for restraint of the
more violent, and greater freedom and 'more nearly
family surroundings for the curable and the gentle.
This will not be in the nature of an experiment, for
i' will be only a slight modification of the system in
use at Gheel, in Belgium, for a long time.
California will do well to consider immediately the
change in plan for our orphan and incorrigible insti
tutions.
The buildings mow used for dormitory and admin
istrative purposes at lone and Whittier may be eco
nomically adapted to the new system, and there will
be no difficulty in finding good and devoted women,
needful of the employment, who will gladly mother
families of the unfortunate.
As to orphan institutions, there is. after all, a sting
in charity, but it is less deep and hurtful in the home
and cottage system than when after- life carries the
memory of a great building, whose frowning walls
speak of restraint and seem but little different from
a jail.

C. G. CALKINS,
Lieutenant Commander, U. S. N., In charge.
the United States had been awaiting the
determination of the ownership of Texas
âthe region between the Sablno and the
Rio Grandeâ so long in dispute between
the United States and Spain. We may im
agine that the settlement of 1819. by
which this territory was consigned to
Spanish control, was not satisfactory to
prospective American settlers who were
ready to follow in the wake of Austin.
By the successful rebellion of Mexico
against Spain and bv the recognition of
Mexican Independence in 1821 this terri
tory became Mexican s>oH. There were
many influences calculated to make Mexi
can rule in Texas distasteful to the Amer
icans who were settling there In Increas
ing numbers. The race prejudice between
the Spaniard *tnd the Anglo-Saxon, the ar
bitrary and capricious rule of Spanish ora
cials the denial of local self-government,
tho prohibition of farther Immigration
from the United States, the lack of order
and the failure to protect life and prop
erty, the 'desire of the Americans from the
Southern States to continue their system
of slave labor, prohibited by Mexico, tho
sympathy and moral aid (if not the ma
terial aid) afforded to the enterprise of
Independence by the United Statesâ all
these influences led to the Texan revolt
asainst Mexico.
In the battle of San Jacinto In 1838 the
Texans vindicated their claim to inde
pendence, and for nine years the "Lone
Star republic" was recognized by the
United States and other powers as one
of the independent sovereignties of th-s
world. Mexico did not relinquish, though
she could not exercise, her sovereignty
over Texas; and when by the consent of
Texas in 1845 that State was admitted to
the American Union we received with the
new State the Texan quarrel with Mexfro
and became responsible for the defense
against Mexico of the Texan claim to ter
ritory on the Rio Grande. Texas claimed
all east of the Rio Grande from Its mouth
to its source. The admission of TexaÂ«
and our assuming the defense of her ter
ritorial claims would probably have been
sufficient to bring tbout war with Mexico.
But the overt and immediate cause of
the war was the occupation by the United
States of the disputed territory between
the Nueces and the Rio Grande. This.
President Polk asserted In his war mes
sage to Congress, had caused the shed
ding "of American blood on American
soil " and Congress declared that a state
of war "existed by the act of Mexico."
The conflict that followed was "short,
sharp and decisive." When the Ameri
can armies had occupied the capital of
the Mexican republic and forced Mexico
to terms of capitulation, American arms
were in military possession of vast tracts
of Mexican territory that the administra
tion of President Polk was unwilling to
surrender. At Guadaloupe. â¢ a little town
near the City of Mexico, on February 2.
1848. a treaty was signed and subsequently
ratified by both republics, by which it
was agreed in consideration of $13,000,000
paid directiv by the United States to Mex
ico and $3,500,000 more paid to citizens of
the United States who had claims against
that country th^t Mexico should relin
quish to the United States her rights and
claims to all, territory north and east of
â¢the Rio Gra-nde and Glla rivers. This
Mexican session embraced Texas, with all
Its claims. New Mexico, California, Ne
vada, Utah. Arizona and part of Colo
rado and Wyrming, an area of over 522.
000 square miles, more than double the
area of any country in Europe, except
Russia. This is an area almost equal to
that of tho original thirteen colonies with
their western lands at the time their in
dependence was achieved.
While the Gadsden purchase was not a
part of the war settlement of 184S. It was
so closely related to it that it must be
noticed here. In 1853, .by. a supplementary
treaty with Mexico, negotiated In behalf
of the United States by Mr. Gadsden of
South Carolina, we acquired 43.000 square
miles more of Mexican territory for the
sum of $10,000,000. and our southern boun
dary became fixed . a9 it has since re
mained. â¢
"A war without ideas behind it Is bru-
it existed, yet not another slave Territory
nor another slave State should bo added
to the American Union.
The Civil War Itself, like the war of
1S12, wrought no territorial changes in
America. The issue involved In that war
was the issue of dismemberment. Should
tho republic that, united, had experienced
such wonderful expansion, be now rent
in twain by Irreparable division? Should
"Mason's and Dlxon's line "âoriginally a
survey between Pennsylvania and Mary
land, subsequently an artificial, imagin
ary line between the slave States and tha
free â tycome an actual and permanent
geographical division betweerf irreconcil
able sections? That issue wis answered
at Appomattox.. Any other answer than,
that there given by the fortune of war
would have resulted In a sadly calamitous
change In the war geography of America.
Alaska became an America possession
by a peaceful treaty of purchase with
Russia in 1S67. The Hawaiian Islands were
annexed by act of Congress on August 12,
1833, an act that was the outcome of a.
bloodless revolution in those Islands.
These changes of ownership are not a
part of our subject proper. But tho stu
dent who has set out to trace the terri
torial changes in America wrought by
war will have to recite the recent im
portant changes brought about by tha
Spanish war of 1S9S.
It was a notable remark of Henry Clay
that nothing struck him with so much
amazement as the fact that historical cir
cumstances so soon pass out of the recol
lection of men. It is not to be supposed
that the momentous historical changes of
the last four years have yet passed out of
the memory of any considerable number
of readers. Yet there is apt to be among
the great body of busy Americans only
an unreallzlng and transient appreciation
of the number and significance of these
changes. So little heed is paid after the
tirst announcement of the events that tha
net result of the recent territorial changes
is not appreciated or understood, and it
would be not a little surprising to many
to know the actual extent of the territo
rial changes of 1S98, the year of our hun
dred days' Spanish war. A mere recital
of these changes is all that may be at
tempted here."
By ' the Spanish-American treaty.
signed by the Peace Commissioners at
Parts December 10, 1S98. ratified by the.
United States Senate February 6, 1S90, and
by the Queen Regent of Spain March 17.
1S99â
(a) Cuba, after having been in the pos
session of Spain for more than 300 years,
was relinquished by Spain to become an
independent state. Though the- Island Is
still held and controlled by the military
forces of the United States, incipient steps
have been taken to secure for it tha
status of an independent state. It is one
of the richest islands of the world, with
an area of 45.000 square miles, and will no
doubt continue- in close relations, if not
in political union, with the United States.
(b) Porto Rico, with an extent of 3GÂ»S
square miles â an island ninety-five miles
long by thirty-five miles broad, known < as
"the gem of the Antilles"â was trans
ferred from Spain to the United States.
(c) The Philippine Islands, almost 2000 in
number, with an area of 115,00) square;
miles and a population of more than 8.000,
000 souls, were transferred. In considera
tion of 120,000,000. from Spain to the United
States.
When we look upon these acquisitions
and consider them In connection with dis
tant Alaska, acquired In 1S67. and Waka
Island in the Pacific, acquired by the title
of discovery in the same year, and Ha
waii, annexed in 1S9S. and Guam, acquired
by treaty in 1898. and Tutulla. Mauna and
four smaller Islands of the Samoan group,
acquired by negotiation with England and
Germany in 1899, not to speak of the com
plications in China and other enterprises
beyond the continent, it may be concluded
that America has become a "world
power." and- that the war geography of
America at the close of the nineteenth
century is a part of the war geography of
the world. JAMES A. WOODBURN.

The American barks Roderick Dhu and
Amy Turner sailed from here in company
on December 2 last. For a time they kept
together and then when a week out they
lost sight of each other during the night.
The Amy Turner went to the westward
and caught a favorable slant of wind,
while the Roderick Dhu held to the course
j laid down on the charts and which Cap-
I tain Johnson had Always found to stand
him in good stead. The favoring winds
took the Turner into Hilo four days ahead
j of the Roderick Dhu and there was great
jubilation aboard the former vessel In
consequence. There was no complaint
aboard the Roderick Dhu. however, as she
arrived on Christmas day and the cold
storage plant on the vessel yielded up
more luxuries in the shape of game, tur
key suckling pig, fowl and fruit than
could be procured on the whole island of
Water Front Notes.
. Captain Gllmore of the Servla will take
command of the Guy C. Goss. Captain
Hardy, who brought^ the Goss from New
York, is in the Marine Hospital, suffering
from a broken arm. The vessel was
caught in a gale off the coast and Cap
taln Hardy was washed from the bridge.
Amy Turner Easily Beats Roderick
Dhu on Bun Down.

THERE nas an Interesting farewell
ceremony on the United States
transport Sherman yesterday.
Captain C. H. Grant Roes East
to-nipht to assume command of
Howard Gould's yacht Niagara and the
officers of the Sherman met in the social
hall of the Sheiman to bid him prod-speed.
AmonK those who were present were
Quartermaster Captain W. C. Cannon, Su
perintendent of the transport service,
Capiain John Karneson, Supervising En
gineer J. H. Matthews and Chief Engi
neer George R. Kingsland of tho Sher
man. The presentation was made by Cap
tain Cnnr.on. Handing Captain Grant a
magiiiiicer.t locxet, suitably inscribed, he
said: "You havo made a good master and
in our opinion the transport service loses
its best officer. You say you will return
to us in a year, but i don't believe it.
When Mr. Gould gets to know you he
will never allow you to come back to Cal
ifornia."
Captain Grant made a sailor's reply.
He said ho could make a better speech
ahout fair and foul weather sailors
than ho could about presentations and
letters of praise. Durlnp the last two
vojra&es the Sherman had been through
unusually trying times and during the
storms that heset them he had found his
officers to be men of the right stamp.
Captain Rarneson paid a tribute to Cap
tain Grant's efficiency* as an officer. "As
a ship master and navigator, he is one
of the ablest men afloat," said the su
perintendent of the transport service.
Captain Barne.-on said he was sorry that
he had not been given a chance to Join
in the testimonial. He was at Once an
swered by Chief Engineer Klngsland, who
said:
"The presentation was a spontaneous
affair among thv officers. Captain Grant
has been our Irlend and we wanted to
Klve him something to remember us by.
He. leaves us to-day, but we want him
to remember that wherever he goes we
will always bear him in our hearts as
an able commander and right royal good
fellow." Â¦
Three cheers were then given for Cap
tain Grant and the ceremony was at an
end.

It was contended by Americans for
nearly two decades that by the Louisiana
treaty of 1S03 we acquired title to botn
Texas and Oregon. A party issue pending
the settlement of these claims looked to
what was cailed the "reannexatlon of
Texas" and the "reoccupation of Oregon."
The dispute over the Oregon country was
settled by the retirement from the north
west coast of Russia and Spain and by
peaceable negotiations between America
and Great Britain.) ending with the Ore
gon treaty of 1846. By the Florida treaty
of 1S19 Spain relinquished to the United
States her claims to thf- northwest coast
north of 42 degrees north latitude. By
the same treaty we relinquished all claim
to Texas, in what Clay called a "quit
claim deed," by which we recognized that
so far as the Louisiana treaty was con
cerned Texas pertained to Spanish Mexico
and not to French .Louisiana. In ttao
same treaty, also, our Louisiana purchase
received for the first time definite limits
on the south and west, as follows: "Be
ginning on the Gulf of Mexico at the
mouth of the Sabine Klver. follow that -
river to 20 degrees north latitude; thenca
on a line due north to the Red River,
westward along this river to the hun
dredth meridian: then northward to the
Arkansas River; westward along this rlv- "
er to its source in the Rocky Mountains,
then a north line to 42 degrees and thon
along that parallel to the Pacific Ocean."
It is now admitted that our .IÂ»uislana
purchase ended at the Rocky Mountains.
What we obtained west of the mountains
pertained to the Oregon country, and it
came to us with the nnal Oregon settle
ment of 1846.
The movement resulting- in the admis
sion of Texas and the acquisition of the
Mexican cessions began with the pro
posed migration of Moses Austin to Tex
as In 1S19. It was In 1822 that Austin's
son iirst colonized in Texas a grant of
land that had been, received from thÂ«Â»

tallty." !>a!d President Oarflelrt. The Â»rreat
war of Ideas that preceded for a. genera
tion the conflict In arms of 1S61 received,
renewed impetus after our acquisition nf
the Mexican cessions. What should be
the status of the new territory aa to slav
ery? Upon this great Issue the vital con
flict was Joined. Did Mexican law (by
which slavery had bpen prohibited as ear
ly as 1S27) apply to the new territory un
til Conjcress had specifically changed It?
Or difl a pro-slavery constitution, as In
terpreted by Calhoun and Rhett and the
radical Southern school . apply ef its own
accord, with its "transmlgrratory nulli
ties." to the territories for the protection
of slavery there? Or should the Wlmot
proviso be applied for the exclusion of
slavery by Congressional authority? Or
should the settlers In the territories under
"popular sovereignty" be allowed to set
tle the question of slavery for them
selves?
It was over these questions that the war
of Ideas raged for a decade. Settled by
a temporary compromise in 1850, these
questions wire again reopened for all the
unsettled Territories In the West by the
repeal in 1854 of the noted Missouri com
promise of 1S20. The Kansas-Nebraska
act of 1SS4, which seems to have made the
Civil War inevitable, opens to view upon
the map a great territorial prize that was
at stake between the slave States and the
free. Texas was the last slave State ad
mitted to the Union. It was evident to
Southern leaders that unless, under what
they called equal rights in the Territories,
more slave States could be obtained from
the "West the long struggle to maintain
the equilibrium of power in the United
States Senate between the slava
States and the free would have to be
abandoned. By the JCebraska act of 1S5I
the slave power entered upon its last des
perate struggle for new soil. So far a3
the Issue thereby enjoined could be set
tled by constitutional and peaceful pro
cesses, it was settled in 1860 by the elec
tion of Lincoln. That election meant
that, while it was not the purpqse to

Temper.
Is Often thÂ« Real Cause of a Sour
That the condition of the digestive or-
gans has a marked effect upon the char-
acter or disposition is a* truism as old as
the hills, old Ben Johnson wisely said
â¢'the pleasure of living depends upon the
liver," and It Is a fact which none may
dispute that a sunny disposition more
often results from a healthy digestion
than from any other cause.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called sour
stomach or heartburn, is caused by slow
digestion of food; instead of being prompt-
ly digested and converted into blood, bone
and muscle, it lies in the stomach for
hours. fi-rmentinR and decaying, creating
gapes which cause pressure on the lungs
and heart, short breath and general dis-
comfort and irritation.
Such half digested food is indeed poor
nourishment lor the body, brain and
nerves, and the result Is shown in Irrita-
ble tempers, unaccountable headaches and
that depressing condition usually called
the "bltits." but how quickly all these
disani^ar nrhen apix-tite and digestion are
restored;
Laxative medicine* only irritate Ahe al-
ready Irritated stomach and bowels and
have no ?Â¦fiVct upon actual digestion of
food.
The penf=iÂ»>le course to follow is to make
us-e of simp'.e. natural digestives like
Stunts Dyspepsia Tablets after* meals
until tho stomach has a chance to recu-
jwratf.
Th*Â» natural digestives which every
healthy Btonsach contains ?re peptor.es,
diastase and hydrochloric and lactic acids,
and when any of them are Â¦lacking' the
trouble begins. The reason Stuart's Dye-
pepsia Tablets are so valuable and suc-
cessful in curing stomach troubles is be-
cause they contain, in a pleasant, concen-
trated tablet form, all these absolutely
necessary essentials for perfect digestion
and assimilation of food.
Henry Kirkpa trick of Lawrence. Mass.,
pays: "Men and women whose occupation
precludes an active outdoor life should
make it a daily practice to use Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after meals. I havo
done so myself and I know positively that
P owe my present health and vigor to
their daily use. , :
"From the time I was 22. when I gradu-
ated from sohool with broken health from
overwork, until I was 34, I scarcely knew
what it was to b? free Irom stomach
weakness. I had no appetite whatever
for breakfast and very little for any other
meal.
"I had acidity and hcartbtirn nearly
ever}" day. and sometimes was alarmed by
irregularity and palpitation of the heart,
hut all this gradually disappeared after I
bepan UFinp Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and I can eat my meals with relish and
satisfaction which I had not known since
I was a. prcwlns lyy."
Th? success andlpopularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is enormous, but it is
deÂ«er\ed. and every druRpist in the United
Stat 1 ??. Canada and Great Britain has a
pood word for this meritorious prepara-
tion.

ehow an Increase cf 76,000,100 shares, or about

icet Ehtrws litUe llTe anywhere, and buying is
c<i^ned almost entirely to email lots. Cur
rants sre unchanged. ' Sales are in little de
mand, but quotations are the same. The ten
dency is easier, however, and it le likely that
prices could be shaded for a round lot. Raisins
are &Â¦ much unsettled as ever, although it was
Fi&tei yesterday that more encouraging reports
had been received from the coast. Seeded are
vpj-j- easv. and it 5s understood sales of cartons
were made lower than tc. A little Inquiry for
2-crcwn and 3-crown loo^e is reported, but no
business of any sire was heard of. Layers
are offered very low. iraJe* of 2-crown are re
ported at $1 23. The poods, it is understood.
wÂ«>re some that have been rejected. Prunes
are dull, thouph there is fair inquiry for 60-70s
ersd Kft-Mft. Some business Is reported in cheap
apMcots at low quotations. It Is said the
buyer was a local houte which recently bought
a considerable number cf cars of better quality
poods. Pecar.s ere *trcneer. An effort by a

NEW YORK; Jan. 10.â Bearish conditions
continue to be dominant in metal circles gen
erally. Tin was acain lower both here and al
London owing to the lack of speculative ln
terett, despite the fact that arrivals for this
year to date have only reached the small total
of forty-one tons. The close at London was
weak at Â£118^ 7s 6d. The local market opened
easy, ruling slow all day, with a weak under
tone, and finally closed easy at $26 30(326 50.
Although reports from London regarding cop
per were of an unfavorable purport, showing
an easy situation there at Â£72, Is 3d, the Jocal
market for that option held quite flrm at fully
mclntained prices â $17 for Lake Superior and
$16 62',4 for casting. Domestic iron markets
continue in a somewhat nominal manner, but
6entlment was bulllshly inclined on account
of an unexpected large Inquiry In the near
future. English markets were Is lower at
Glasgow to 55s 9d and Middlesboro, 48s 9d.

lifted the level of the prices considerably above
the lowest. The epurt In Louisville arid Nash
\-ille Just at the close on the increase in the
dividend rate helped the market somewhat, al
tbough thfcre was no general response. The
closing was in fact decidedly unsettled and
irregular and at a substantially lower level
of prices. The flnn movement of the bulls was
in the Southwesterns, seme of the specialties.
Including Texas and Pacific, Union Pacific,
Southern Pacific, Delaware and Hudson, Peo
ple's Gar and Western Union. The last named
stock was the only one of the group which
showed sustained strength with an extreme ad
vance of nearly 3 points. Missouri Paciflc was
marked up at one time to S7, but fell back
below 85 In the sharpest reaction of the day.
Still later there was a movement in the to
bacco stocks which carried Continental and
American Tobacco up 8 points. Tennessee Coal
4^4 and General Electric fc 1 *. But the general
disiKisition to realize profits and the rather
aggressive mood of the bears frustrated all the
attempts to advance the market. The rather
violent break In St. Paul of 4Vj points at the
opening had a decidedly disturbing effect on
speculative sentiment and some of the other
stocks which have been the subject of the most
persistent stories of inclusion in*vast new con
solidations were also quite acutely affected.
The repeated disclaimers by the financiers con
cerned of any of ths ttories which have cir
culated regarding these combinations have
been totally disregarded heretofore by the spec
ulative element, but something like conviction
was borne In upon them to-day, and while
the belief was unaffected that something very
important had been going on in railroad quar
ters the speculators awoke to the realization
that th? elaborate details published from time
to time were based on very flimsy evidence and
that they did not know much about the actual
transactions. The extreme decline in St. Paul
was 1%. and it reached from 1 to 3 points in
practically every important Btock on the list.
The Eries. the Readings., the grangers, Penn
sylvania and the Pacifies were most affected
Rubber preferred broke 4U points. Pressed
Steel Car 4 4 and the preferred 6. The bears
were timid, however, about pressing their ad
x-antage. This element is so eager to discount
the expected reaction that they keep the mar
ket well filled with thort accounts and upon
any considerable reaction they begin to buy
eagerly to cover. ThÂ» existence of the per
sistent short interest 1? a material factor In
the resisting power of the market. It played
its part in effecting the rally from the ex
treme low point. After the flirt drop in prices
and the dislodging of the weaker speculative
accounts there was a decided falling oft In
the pressure of liquidation, which added much
to the timidity of the bears. The rally ex

CLOSING.
Discounts were higher, affected by yester
day's rise in Paris, while the bank began bor
rowing on consols. Money, however, was plen
tiful, although the bank returns showed re
pyaments by the market of Â£3,500,000. These,
however, were absorbed by money returning to
the provinces, leaving the market balances
unimproved.
Americans began heavy and after displaying
a hardening tendency, broke sharply on reports
of the New York opening prices, St. Paul fall
ing 5 points in flve minutes. Erics and North
ern Pacifies .were also adversely affected, the
last mentioned being sold from Berlin on pri
vate cables, intimating that the Hill deal Is
not going quite as was expected. The close
was flat and disheartening.
NEW YORK, Jan. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The marktts here were slack and idle to-day
and there was evidence that interest Is pass
ing from American securities to thoce of the
homo market.
LONDON, Jan. 10.â Money was easy and
abundant to-day. It is believed the Bank of
England is taking steps to reduce the floating
6upply, but this probably will prove a difflcult
undertaking with euch a plethora. Discounts
were steady. Outside of the American depart
ment the operations on the stock ex
change were featureless, the approach of the
settlement restricting transactions. Americans
opened dull, reacted, hardened, fluctuated and
closed weak and irregular with some further
declines. After regular hours there was a
great disposition toward profit taking. Grand
Trunks were lower, the traffic return being
less favorable than had been expected, this be
ing attributed to the inclusion of Western re
ceipts.

JURORS TESTIFY
ON DALTON CASE
WASHINGTON, Jan. lO.-Solidtor Gen
eral Richards resumed his argument in
the Porto Rican cases when the Supreme
Court convened to-day. Before taking up
the line of his argument he made reply
to a question by Justice WTiite as to the
meaning of the words, "the- territories,"
as used by Chief Justice Marshall in tha
Loughborough case. He said in that
connection that the- power of Congress
over territory does not cease when it !â¢â¢
organized and brought under the United
States, but that he did recognize that
there is a distinction In the control un
der the differing circumstances.
Discussing the constitutional provision
of uniformity in the matter of taxation.
Mr. Richards said that provision was In
serted to remedy the divers and conflict
ing claims of the various States compris
ing the Union in the matter of revenues
and was never meant to apply to a condi
tion like that which now confronts the
SsTionl COnnectlon w "h its insuiar
W'hen Mr. Richards concluded Attorney
. r J ei ?, 1 Grl S* s addressed the court. He
said his remarks were intended to be
supplemental to those submitted in the
cases involving similar questions which
have heretofore been argued. Before pro
ceeding with his argument the Attorney
Ph e Â« ne^L t S Ok E P *i hat he characterised as
the misapprehension concerning his po
sition on these. He said there were nu
merous erroneous statements in the brief
of the appellants in the Armstrong caee
and he quoted some of them, giving hi"4
nterpretatlon of his own remarks made
In the previous presentation of the sub
ject.
Taking up the question of taxes the
Attorney General contended that the con
f,nffi!J On it dOe ? ?Â°S. P rovld ,Â° for absolute
uniformity of duties under all circum
8 and Â»u th fi t lhe uniformity clause
of the constitution refers to the State*
and not to the Territories. 8
The power to govern territory. Mr
Cxrlggs said, is expressly conferred bv
the constitution. This power was given
without limitation and there was no res
ervation of power in the people of the
ot T the Sut's gh thCre l9 ln he pc Â°P'e
Then he drew the Inference that the
power to govern territory, which is ab
solutely conferred upon Congress, includes
th 3 1 power to tax except by indirect
methods. This right was absolute, but
l * d^ B H at \ c ' -, a^ d J" ir - GrI **s contended
that it included the constitutional right
to levy duties on merchandise imported
Into the United States from its insulai
possessions, and that such a proceeding
does not violate the uniformity clause
"The lawÂ». the administration and t'hÂ«
revenue of the territories are subject to
the absolute control of Congress " Mr
Grigrgs declared. "Congress may repeal
the whole form of government existing in
a territory; may destroy the Legislature
vacate all the offices and take over all
the public funds and absorb them into
the common treasury; it may appropriate
out of the Federal treasury all the money
necessary to carry on a territorial gov
ernment, omitting all local taxation "
â¢Referring to the acquisition of Porto
Rico and the Philippines, Mr. GriKgs said:
"The Islands are territory belonging to
the United States, not a part of the
United States. The islands were the
things acquired by the treaty; the United
States was the party that acquired them
and to whom they belong. The owner
and the thing owned are not the same "
Mr. Griggs said that many instances ol
legislation show that Congress has al
ways considered something more than the
term "United States" to be necessary
when it desicned a statute to extend to
territory. Ho cited authority to show that
internal revenue laws have not been uni
versal In application in the history of the
country, and concluded that "while Con
gress has provided throughout the United
States and Territories for the enumera
tion upon which ' direct taxes have - been
apportioned, it never seems to have" been
supposed that such taxes must be levied
beyond the States or apportioned to the
Territories unless Congress saw fit bo to
provide." ; â¢ .
Referring to the President's right to ex
ercise the legislative Â», function, he said:
"When, as commander in chief, he exer
cises government over conquered terri
tory, he has by the undoubted law of na
tions the right not only to govern but to
make laws â¢ for the territory so ordered
The legislative functions thus exercised
are merely Incidents under the public law
of belligerent right, vested by the consti
tution in the President as commander in
chief of the army and navy."
Says His Views on Arm
strong Case Were Not
Fully Understood.
ATTORNEY GENERAL
IN EXPLANATION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.â In thÂ© Senate
to-day Teller of Colorado presented a
memorial from 2006 Filipinos and "peace
able inhabitants" of Manila. The memorial
was In the form iff an appeal to Congress,
and as Teller stated "was signed person
ally by the leading people of Manila and
that section, lawyers, bankers and pro
fessional men. representing the best ele
ments of that community."
It reviewed the circumstances leading
up to the present struggle of the Filipi
nos for Independence. It paid a high trib
ute to the work of Aeruinaldo and
his coadjutors in their endeavor to ob
tain liberty and independence for the peo
ple of the Philippines. Reference
was made to some of the principal
events of the present revolution against
American authority, the petition urging
that the American troops had failed to
make serious impression upon the revolu
tionary party. It pointed out that Aguin
aldo had declared he might lose the hope
of victory, but he would not lose the lib
erty and independence of his people. It
points out that the re\'olutlon has the
support of practically all the people of
the Philippines, and declares that though
100 revolutionists be destroyed, 1000 will
rise up to support the fight for Independ
ence. All of the islands in the archipel
ago, eays the memorial, s.re supporting:
the revolution, and they will not yield
until the last of the Filipino blood has
been shed.
The Filipino nation, the memorial con
tinues, bearing in mind the history of
America and its humanitarian doctrines,
asks the Government of the United States
to cease Its "persecution of men strug
gling to be free â struggling against great
er odds and greater wrong than those
which inspired the fathers of the repub
lic." This they ask "in the name of
Washington, of . Jefferson, of Lincoln, in
the name of justice and in the name of
the Eternal." .
The appeal declares that an autonomy
similar to that enjoyed by Canada or
Australia would not be practicable- for the
Filipinos, who desire full liberty and in
dependence, and they urge the Govern
ment of the United States to give them
liberty and independence.
Teller presertted an order for the print
ing of the Filipino petition as a Senate
document.
"I protect against the paper being print
ed as a -Senate document, said Hawley.
"It is an attack upon the United States,
Its authority and its troops, and a pas
sionate appeal to the Filipinos to continue
to kill our men. If Jefferson Davis had
brought forward a similar paper after the
battle of Gettysburg and requested to
have It read and printed as a Senate docu
ment it would have been a mild crime In
comparison with this."
On account of the objection of Hawley
the order went over until to-morrow.

the farmer and the public at large. Mr.
Wilson said that the amount of butter
disposed of annually is about eighteen

Fcrr.ething over one pound, and he said in
response to Sprinper that he considered
this dangerous competition. He was of
the opinion that thrre was danger in the

the u!>e of improved methods would re-
Balt in driving renovated butter out of

accept the opinion that the regulation of
the oleomargarine business would Injure
the beef cattle business, and said that
farmers would f.nd it profitable to keep

Jesse W. Noble, one of the oldest em
ployes of the Southern Pacific Company,
was struck by a switch engine at 7 o'clock
this morning at the West Oakland rail
road yards and instantly killed. Mr. No
ble was going to work at the Peralta
street section and steppe/3 out from be
hind a freight train onto a track upon
which a switch engine was moving. He
seemed to become confused, and before
the aged man could get out of harm's
way tha locomotive had struck him.
The accident occurred near the car re
pair shop.. No sooner had Noble been
struck than the engine was stopped. As
sistance was auickly at hand, but It was
seen at once that the accident had been
fatal. The Coroner took charge of the
case, removing the body to the Morgue.
The deceased railroad man had been one
or the first employes of the company. He
was in former Superintendent W. B. Lud
low's car repair department for many
years. Recently he had been a caboose
inspector, having been given the work be

KILLED WHILE ON
HIS WAY TO WORK
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Jan. j 10.
The testimony of G. A. Roberts, the
city's second witness in the ; water rate
suit, showing the size of the flow of water
from the Roberts wells under* pressure,
remained practically unshaken through
out three hours of the severest " cross
examination to-day by the water com
pany's attorneys.
Roberts brought with him the engineers'
tables which he used In computing the
flow of the wells, and which were called
into question by Attorney McCutchen
yesterday. The authenticity of the tables
was apparent as soon as they were sub
mitted in evidence and the opposition ' di
rected Its efforts toward attacking, the
manner in which Roberts had used them.
The method of his computations was can
vassed minutely and repeatedly. The
contents of a cubic foot, the number of.
the laces of a cube, the cubic inches in a
gallon and the gallons in a cubic foot were
a few of the subjects of the volleys of
questions by which it was attempted to
confuse the" witness and Involve him In
contradictions. Paradoxical problems in
hydrostatics were propounded, which
were a little beyond the witness' depth,
but on these points he was careful not to
commit himself otherwise than to say that
he had relied on the tables... . .
"Now see here," said McCutchen,
"what right have you to assume that the
volume of water flowing through a weir
fifteen Inches wide is fifteen times that
flowing through a weir one Inch wide?
Don't you know that the momentum of a
body of water of the one size Is greater
than that of the other?"
"How long, how long?" groaned Judge
Hayne. But It appeared that the cross
examination was finally at an end. Then
Hayne arose and with bewildering grav
ity began a burlesque of his opppnent's
methods of cross-questioning.
"Now, Mr. Roberts." he said, "you have
testified under oath about some blue mud.
How do you know that it was blue?
Wasn't it", as a matter of fact, red mud?
"What is blue?"
"Why â blue," the witness stammered,
"blue isâ just blue." .
"Ah! It seems you don't know. Now
see here, what is two times two?" ,
"Four."
"Four? Mightn't it be five? How do
know that the arithmetics haven't lied to
you?"
By this time court and spectators were
grinning broadly, but the mock examina
tion continued for ten minutes, after
which the witness was excused.
Roberts' testimony established the fact
that the wells had been pumped at the
rate of from 350,000 to 625,000 gallons each
per day for from three to eight days at a
time with no diminution in their flow.
The evidence thus put on record will be
supported by expert testimony.
The next witness for the city was Pro
fessor A. C. Lawson, head of the depart
ment of geology and mineralogy in the
University of California.
Professor Lawson was asked to state his
opinion, as an expert, on the bodies of
water underlying the region about San
Lorenzo.
The water company's attorneys, undis
mayed, at once attacked the learned gen
tleman's competency to testify. Moore
discoursed of strata and formations and
wanted to know why the professor didn't
show any evidences of having peered be
neath the surface of the ground and found
some of the gold presumably concealed
there.
"Does the court for a moment suppose
that human eyes, however skilled, can be
come microscopic and penetrate to the
bowels. of the earth?" he demanded.
The court apparently did not suppose
that that had any direct bearing on the
case and ruled that the witness was quali
fied to testify as an expert on water
bearing areas.
The professor will give his testimony at
to-morrow's hearing.

feelings came on every morning after
drinking coffee for breakfast, no matter
how well I felt when I got up. >.S'
"I began to think the subject over and
finaly decided to try Postum Food Coffee
ln place of common coffee and see if it
was coffee that had been hurting me. Af-
ter making the change I discovered, to
my delight, that the headache and worn

"After a very thorough trial I am fully
convinced that coffe* -was the cause of
my trouble, and that leaving It off and
tiEing Po.=tum Food Coffee has restored

"My father, who has had very poor
health for pevcral years, quit coffee some
time ago and began using Postum In place
of it- It would surprise anyone to see
how rnuch he has improved.

Track Notes.
The horses in training owned by W. R.
Larzalere, P. Ryan and Phil Archibald
will be sold at publlo auction In the sad
dling paddock to-morrow.
The Tanforan Park management has of
fered a special purse.. of $1000 for a race
between Brutal, Rolling Boer, Articulate
and Canmore. It has been decided that
the weights carried shall be seven pounds
below the scalcand the distance one mile.
To make it more interesting a jackpot of
$100 a corner will add to the value of the
added money, the -owner of each three
year-old putting up that amount. The
race' will be run on the. second Saturday
of the coming Tanforan meeting. An ef
fort will be made to get Sam Loates, the
Knglish rider, to- pilot Articulate. Nash
Turner will have the amount on -Rolling
Boer, O'Connor astride Brutal and
Mounce or Sloan on Canmore.
A pair of gold spurs will be presented to
the jockey riding the winner of the Win
ter handicap, to be decided at the next*
meeting at Tanforan. Â¦
Caesar Young 'purchased Meehanus of
Wyoming was almost backed off the
boards to finish first for the closing seven
furlong selling affair. Lomond gave him
quite a tussle, leading to the paddock,
when O'Connor got to the front on the
choice, scoring by a length. Essence
"beat the poorly ridden Montallade for
the show honors.
Six two-year-olda of unknown quantity
started in the three-furlong dash follow
ing. Dr. McNutt, a dark brown colt by
Halma from the Hildreth j stable, was
backed down to favoritism. He showed
ionly an ordinary turn of Bpeed, finishing
third Lapidus, with Mounce up, led al
most from the start, downing Jack Tyrrell
two lengths. â¢
One of the biggest plunges of the day
was made on Handicapper, a starter in
the five and a half-furlong sprint, third
to be decided. Specially prepared at Ingle
slde, the Shields entry had O'Connor in
the saddle, and after closing a 3 to 2 fa
vorite, ran unplaced. Imp. Broadbrim., at
odds of iVi to 1. came in first, half a length
before Duckoy. while three lengths
further away Florinel took the show.
Bee Bee, the fast mare from the' Burns
& Waterhouse stable, seems to have lost
her winning form. She ruled favorite for
the first event and could not get a mark.
Mounce sent Urchin, a 6 to 1 chance, along
from third position In the stretch, beat
ing 'Fidel Youlin out a length.
It certainly was some consolation for
the talent after being separated from its
coin to know that Lennep does not like
mud; at least not yesterday's number.
Only two or three books were aware of
the fact, and nothing could make them
rub the 6 to 5 chalked against Fred Fos
ter's mare. Rojllng Boer, carrying 84
pounds, was backed from 2 to 8 to 5, and
after stepping off the mile and fifty yards
did not draw a long breath. Lennep, the
favorite, even lost the place to The
FVetter, the. only other starter. t ;-
It was not until the last event was de
cided that a favorite could' be credited
with taking a purse, and then Wyoming
won. The bookmakers would have stored
up enough to last them through the damp
season had it not been for the wins of
Kolling Boer and the favorite above men
tioned.
due solely to the excellent hand
ling the horse received at the hands of
Mounce. With more racing luck the old
mare Lena could have scored, and better
Judgment on the part of J. Miller would
have put Greenock over the plate first.
The track was very heavy and Inclined to
be holding, which fact naturally caused
luck to figure as a strong factor. Telamon,
the three-year-old from Sam Hildreth's
stable, with 90 pounds In the saddle, closed
post favorite. Jack Martin kept him in
eecond position to the stretch, when he
began falling back beaten. Saving con
siderable ground by hugging the rail
around the far turn. Miller had Greenock
clear of his field when the straight for
home was reached, the Schorr horse look
ing all over a winner. Miller, however,
did not cut acroes to the ridge, wheTre the
footing was not. so deep, later losing his
lead. Below the paddock Malay looked
dangerous, but both Anjou and Lena
passed him, Mounce on the former beat
ing Lena a neck. The winner went to the
post second choice in the ring:. , .

ing stake at Oakland yesterday,

mile and a sixteenth, and it "was

REAIi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Godfrey Langhenry, president of the Ill
inois Brewing Association, was elected
president of the American Bowling Con
gress to-day after an' exciting contest.
Charles H. Ebbetts of Brooklyn and F.
W. Moore of - Chicago were also candi
dates. Langhenry received 65 votes and
Ebbetts 51. Other officers were elected as
follows: First vice president, W. V.
Thompson, Chicago; second vice presi
dent, F. W. Pryor, New York; secretary,
Samuel Karpen, Saylon, Ohio; treasurer,
George P. Strack. Astoria, N. Y.; execu
tive committee â ThomaS Curtis of Brook
lyn, chairman; D. XV. Young of New
York, J. F. Gruver of Cleveland. F. H.
Brill of Chicago, Herman Collins of Cleve
land and Martin Kern of St. Louis.
Bowling for two men championship be
gan to-day in the annual tournament of
the American Bowling Congress, all of
the five men teams, with two exceptions,
having- completed their games.
-Mr. Langhenry. president of the Ameri
can Bowling Congress, uaid: "The women
have no right to call themselves a na
tional congress, for they are not. They
are a local organization, sprung up within
the last few weeks."
"We admit that we have no State
leagues, which Mr. Langhenry says are
necessary," said Mrs. L. C. Waithsmuth,
"but I fall to see Just why these things
are necessary to a national congress.
There were women bowlers in Cleveland,
Brooklyn, New York and In Toledo, with
whom we corresponded and who wished to
attend the congress. But they have not
bowled in public and felt a certain diffi
dence about appearing before the large
numbers of spectators who would attend
such an event, and they did not come.
But we are very successful nevertheless.
We have already $200 in the treasury and
our receipts at the door average $50 every
day."
CHICAGO, Jan. 10.â The American
Bowling Congress has refused to recog
nize the women's tournament as national,
and the promoters of the latter feel-ag
grieved. Those in power in the American
Bowling Congress say that the women are
holding a local tournament, and that their
gathering has no right to its claim of be
ing national. :

BOWLERS DENY
WOMEN'S CLAIMS
NEW YORK, Jan. 10.â The suit brought
by Anton J. Dlttmar, the New York law
yer, as assignee of Asher Werthelmer, the
London bric-a-brac dealer, to enjoin the
trustees of the estate of the late Jay
Gould from paying over to the Countess
de Castellane any portion of the income
of her share of the estate, was called In
the Supreme Court to-day on an applica
tion to continue, pending the trial of the
action, a temporary injunction issued by
Justice Fitzgerald preventing the Goulds
from sending any money to their sister.
By an agreement between counsel, the
Goulds have been permitted to send to
tbe Countess J19.S00 a month for the last
two months. .
Mr. Utermeyer of counsel for Dittmar
presented an affidavit to-day from
wertheimer, giving detailed accounts of
all the articles sold by him to the Castel
lanes and alleging that they were worth
all that wa's charged for them. Annexed
to this affidavit â¢ Mr. Werthelmer has
placed much of the correspondence that
passed between himself and Count de
Castellane. In the earlier Â¦ letters the
Count acknowledges the receipt of goods
ordered by him and agrees to Battle as
alleged by Mr. Werthelmer in his affi
davit. Interest, says the Count, on all
credit purchases is to be reckoned at four
per cent per annum.
ftv several letters the Count pleads the
Spanish-American war as an excuse for
not meeting his obligations. He says
"that his income is delayed by the war.
In one letter the Count assures Mr. Wert
helmer that this income will shortly in
crease and that the recipient knows that
as soon as the Count has a few "sous'
they will be at thq disposal of . the
. In a letter dated London, April 6. 1899.
the Count writes that he has made an
arrangement with his brother-in-law by
which Mr. Werthelmer's bill will be paid
in eight days. In a letter written in
January. 1900. the Count ' asked Wert
heimer to discontinue legal proceedings,
saying that he was about to visit America
to realize on certain securities for the
benefit of his creditors. The Count
offered, to sell, on his return from
America, a, portion of his furniture,
taking in payment the drafts held by
Wertheimer signed by* the Count.

in the case of Sloan the facts, In so far
as his Â«tiumphs are concerned, are there.
They speak for themselves. I tried to set
the young Jockey to ride for me once, but
he had another engagement.
"Do I think he will ever rfiJe In England

also the trainer of the Prince of Wales'
horses. One of his best racers is Green
Ivy, who has carried oil many big stakes.
Mr. Cloete was asked for an opinion on
the Sloan affair. "I don't know a thing

I have seen in the papers. If Sloan says
he has received no official notice of the

of his disbarment was incorrect.
can and English racing JXr. Cloete said:
"There are three points in an American
Jockey's riding: which. In my opinion, give
him an advantage over the English rider.
First, he gets off in better season. There
is a lack of spirltednuss on the part of
the English Jockey in getting his horse
into line.
"Second, the American Jockey gets out
of the wind. HÂ» accomplishes this by
leaning forward In his saddle. The Eng
lish rider sits almost bolt upright, thereby
subjectlng himself lo the wind, which
must necessarily impede swiftness.
"Third, the American uses a short stir
rup, which enables him to bear his weigh'
upon the horse's shoulder instead of h!s
back, and this point. I believe. Is a most
important one. The horse feels the weight
less with a rider sitting in this sr>osltion
and It also allows a awing of body impos
sible with the rider sitting upright."
Mr. Cloete was asked why the English
men do not follow the American example
in respect to the points noted. "Because,"
said he, "our trainers are averse to it.
They are not as intelligent as your train
ers and these things have to be brought
to them by degrees. It would not do for
us to try and dictate to them too much.
They are the trainers and they are held
'responsible for thÂ© work of their Jocke>-3.
Recently the short stirrup has been Intro
duced and I believe the qjther changes will
be made- in time."
After visiting Japan Mr. Cloete will re
turn to England in time to attend the Lin

WARM WORDS OF PRAISE
FOR JOCKEY TOD SLOAN
CINCINNATI. Jan. 10.â The Jeffries-
Ruhlin fight on February 15 has not yet
been declared off by the Saengerfest
Athletic Association of Cincinnati, but
late to-night the sentiment seems stronger
than ever that the fight will not come off
here, and that It will be declared oft with
in the next twenty-four hours.
"While the directors of the Saengerfest
Athletic Club are not in session to-night,
some of them are with their attorneys
and their opponents are also engaged with
counsel. Under the Ohio statutes It Is
claimed that the contest will be held to
be a felony, and that even if it was only
a sparring match it could not be given
under the auspices of the Saengerfest
Club, which was organized for the pur
pose of conducting this fight only, and
which is not a standing organization for
the development of athletics, etc But
while counsel for the directors and for
the various organizations opposing them
are rendering opinions on the statutes and
on the decisions of the Supreme Court,
the real element that is generally consid
ered as the one against having" the fight
here is political, and it includes leaders
who have seldom taken part in such con
troversies.
There is much gossip on the street to-
night about the pleadings of these lead
ers to Mayor Flelschmann. The sporting
fraternity is offering odds tnat the fight
will be declared off, and even that Mayor
Flelschmann will not Issue his permit on
the ground that he cannot legally do so
under the advice of counsel. The Mayor
made his promise without consulting the
corporation counsel or other attorneys.
The directors of the Saengerfest Athletic
Association were in session from. 10 a. m.
until 1 p. m.. and after adjournment an
nounced that they had not considered the
question of declaring the fight off. but
that they had been in consultation with
their attorneys on plans for redress
against those who have circulated false
reports about the fight being declared off.
The directors met again at 4 p. m. with
their attorneys, and at 6 p. m. handed out
to members of the press, who were await
ing the result of their action, the follow
ing statement, which is said to have been
prepared by legal counsel and unani
mously adopted by the directors:
"In relation to the proposed contest an
nounced for February 15, the board of di
rectors authorized the following state
ment:
"After a cession with their counsel they
have not changed their position one bit.
and any announcement that the contest is
off is in no way authorized."

INDIANAPOLIS. Jan. 10.â The seauel to
an attempt made by a mob of white men
last night to drive front Newburc. War
wick County, a negro whoso wife is al
leged to be a white woman, may be an at
tempt to lynch the black man. The negro
moved into the vlllae^ a few days ago.
The report that his wife was a. white wj
man aroused indignation and he was or
dered to leave. He refused to obey the
order and a crowd of thirty or forts'
whites "went to his house and commanded
him to come out. The nesrro fired at the
whites and the shooting became- general.
Sixty shots were tired, but nobody was
wounded. The mob finally retired. The
Sheriff of Warwick County went to the
scene of the trouble and unsuccessfully
urged the latter to leave, the latter declar
ing he would stay In ils house. The ne
rroes of Newburs have congregated at
the cabin, heavily armed, expecting an
attack. A mass race tins of the citizens
will be held this morning.
The slxty-aecond General Assembly of
Indiana convened to-day. Governor-elect
Durbin (Rep.) will bt> inaugurated next
Monday.
Governor Mount, in his fare-well mes*
sage, deplored the brutal lynching* that
have dishonored the 3tata and said:
"The remedy might be found through
the co-operation of good citizens in de
manding a rigid enforcement of the law
and not through mob violence."
The message says of kidnaping:
"Where the kidnapers have no legal or
blood claim, where the abduction la for
ransom or for any other unlawful pur
pose. It should be mada In extreme cases
punishable by death 'or imprisonment for
life." *Â¦

The guests at the Russ House who hap
pened to be In tha dining-room at lunch
hour "Wednesday were given a treat not
down on the bill of fare. Recently tha
waiters began to show a lack of Interest
In their work. Even a sharp calling down
failed to accomplish the desired end and
Manager Harrison concluded to dispoae of
the entire force.
He didn't want to give them notice, for
he believed the men might quit in the
midst of a meal. So he made hla plans
accordingly. Soon after the lunch hour
commenced yesterday and while the old
staff of waiters unsuspiciously perambu
lated about the dining-room taking tha
guests' orders the front doors swung open
and in marched a squad of colored gentle
men.
Proprietor Harrison had calculated welL
It was not necessary for him to tell the
white fellows that tUir services were no
longer needed. They took the hint, let
fall their trays, glares and napkins and
made tracks for the bacK door. Tha
cashier was on hand, so they didn't have
to come back. Â«
Meanwhile the colored waiters had
donned their uniforms and the lunch pro
ceeded without further Interruption. ThiJ
is the first time In forty years that colored
waiters have been employed In the Ru.Â«
House. Â»

GRAHAM FALLS BEHIOT)
JUDGE DATNGEHFUXD
Counsel Representing the Contestant
Expect Big Gain in tie Forty-
Second District.
Judge Thomas F. Graham's plurality of
276 votes ever Jufl^e William R. Dainger
n>ld Is gone, and, more than that. Judge
Dair.gerfield now leads In the contest by
three votes. When the recounting of bal
lots began yesterday Judge Dainrerfleid
Â¦was three votes behind â¢ his opponent.
Each precinct counted during the day de
veloped a difference In favor of ona or
the other candidate. In five of the nine
precincts counted Graham gained votes
but Dainirerfleld pickeo. up a greater gain
In the other four. At the end of tne day's
recount he had made a net gain of six
votes, which places him in the lead by
three votes, and at least places the candi
dates on an equal footing at this time for
the remainder of the recount.
Counsel representing Judge Dalncerfleld
expect to make a big gain In the Forty
second District. In that district there
wore many supporters of Judge Bahrs
and this fact leads the contestant's coun
sel to believe that it will be found that
on many ballots fivÂ« long term, instead cÂ£
four long term and one snort term Judees
were voted for. This error, which has re
sulted in many ballots being thrown out
they belie\ - e. will work more In the fa
vor of their client than !n favor of Judr e
Graham, for the reason that the major
ity of Bahrs* supporters were Republicans
and voted t~e Repub.ica;. ticket, support
ing him as well as the other RepuDlican
cantuu ates :or the Superior bench and
hence their errors will not Injure bain
tjerfield. w..o & a 'emocrat.
The recount goes on again to-day.
Interesting reports were received yes
tf^day by the stockholders of the Spring
Valley Water Company. These repre
sented all the departments of the com
pany's work. They were embodied In
President Charles Webb Howard's annual
report. In addition to this the officers for
the current year were elected. Charles
Webb Howard, who has held the position
over a quarter of a century, was again
made -president, A. EL Payson was 're
elected vice president and S. C. Blgelow.
C. de Guigne, H. S. King, Thomas Brown
and F. J. Symmes directors.
President Howard's report dealt with
the finances and also the work of de
velopment in the past twelve months that
has been performed by the company. The
income from water rates for the year was
$1,884,752 34. From other sources the total
income was $41,954 93. The operating ex
penses amounted to $423,609 52; coupon In
terest to $5S6,500 and the Interest on the
floating debt to $24,123 32. The item' of
taxes President Howard called attention
to. The amount paid was $226,660 02. The
assessment was raised $2,000,000 by the As
sessor of the city and county of San
Francisco some months after the time
for fixing the water rates. - Â¦ â¢' .*. .
Twelve dividends of 42 cents each were
declared, which was equivalent to 5- per
cent in the total. The amount was $7U5,
600. Altogether there was paid out $39,
7S5 in excess of the receipts, the Increase
in the company's assessment for taxes
being the cause.
. President Howard spoke of the rainfall.
During the last three years the total rain
fall was only 44.55 inches, an average of
14.85 per annum. Taking a period of fifty
previous years, the average annual rain
fall had been 25 inches. The three dry
years demonstrated the wisdom of storing
a three years' supply. Anything less in
store would mean disaster. There was
not a good outlook for a wet winter, the
report said, but the supply would be suf
ficient for the city.
Speaking of tne Improvements of the
year. President Howard said that, in addi
tion to the large gravel filter constructed
at Sunol, considerable work had been
accomplished, consisting of flume and
pipe laying and also the construction of a
Bcreenhouse at Niles. The filter and
aqueduct have increased the daily supply
by 3,000,000 gallons and the -total daily
water supply from the Sunol country now
amounts to 10,000,000 gallons. An addi
tion has been made to the pumping plant
at Seventeenth street for. the benefit of
the Clarendon Heights districts. ' ,
A trestle* has also been built across
Islais Creek on piers with forty-four-inch
wrought iron plpe.to take the place of the
old pipe. An extension from the trestle
on land owned by the company has been
made In both directions, aggregating- 1325
feet. Connection will be made with the
forty-four-inch main from University
Mound Reservoir. Pipe has also been
laid across Army street to take the placs
of the old one. The distributing system
in San Francisco has been largely in
creased.

SAN FRANCISCO
WATER SUPPLY
On the advice of his attorney. Auditor
Wells decided yesterday to withhold pay
ment of two demands for overpaid taxes
on alleged erroneous assessments. The
first calls for the return of $1056 23 taxes
on a personal property valuation of $63,
000 charged against Abby M. Parrott on
the Emporium property. Mrs. Parrott
claimed that the item of $65,000 was in
cluded in her assessment on improve
ments calling for $765,000, while the tax
thereon had already been paid by the Cen
tral Light and Power Company for its
electric machinery and fixtures.
The Supervisors passed a resolutions
which was signed by the Mayor, directing
the Auditor and the Treasurer to refund
the $1056 25. The Auditor has discovered
that it is an illegal claim, because only
one installment of taxes has been paid by
Mrs. Parrott, and even ir tne claim was
valid she would be entitled only to the re
turn of one-half the amount named, or
$528 12. The Auditor holds that there la
nothing on the assessment roll to show
that the assessment was duplicated. Un
der the c"ode defects in form in any as
sessment book may be corrected by the
Assessor only with the written consent
of the City or District Attorney at any
time prior to the sale for delinquent taxes.
The Auditor will also withhold payment
of a claim. for $1625 tiled by the Pacific
Coast Company on an assessment of per
sonal property. The company alleged that
its bookkeeper by a clerical error overas
sessed the property to the extent of $100.
000 on solvent credits. The Auditor finds
nothing in the original statement filed
with the Assessor to show that the com
pany was overassessed. Under the code
the taxes should have been paid under
protest, but this was not done. The reso
lution directing the Auditor to refund the
money was passed by the Supervisors and
signed by, the Mayor on the recommenda
tion of Deputy Assessor Ginty, who ex
amined the company's books. Auditor
Wells says that tncro must be some more
definite reason to warrant the refunding
of the taxes.

AUDITOR DENIES
ILLEGAL CLAIMS
Under the provisions of the act quoted,
a conviction of the company for the es
cape of the Chinese is impossible. The
act provides that any master or owner
of a vessel who knowingly permits any
Chinese to be landed, or who aids and
abets In the same, is guilty of a misde
meanor and may be punished by a line of
not less than $500 for each passenger so
landed. As the Pacific Mail Company did
not knowingly permit the escape of the
Chinese there can be no reasonable excuse
for beginning suit against the company
under the act. 'j
V.'lth respect to your, recommendation that
proceedings be taken against the raciflc Mail
Steamship Company on their bond, you axe
adviped that, if a bond nan been given by the
said company it is doubtless the result of
some action taken by the Collector of Cus
toms for his protection, the department having
no onici.il cognizance of such arrangement.
The case, however, Is one that shows upon
its face a gross neKlisence by the said com
pany. In view of which the matter has been
referred to the Attorney General with the re
quest that proper steps be taken for the con
viction of the company under the provisions of
section 9 of the act approved September 13, 1888.

Chief Dunn of the Chinese Bureau re
ceived a letter yesterday from Immigra
tion Commissioner Powderly Informing
him that the Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany is not under bonds for the safe keep

the Mail dock. The letter reads as fol
lows: /

MYSTEHIOUS BURGI^A-BY
IN AN UPTOWN SALOON
Police Think That Some One Familiar
Â¦With Premises Is Guilty of
the Act.
A burglary, surrounded with some pe-
culiar features, occurred at the saloon of
F. A. Schou. at the corner of Seventh and
Market streets, between the hours of 2
and 7) o'clock yesterday morning. It is
the opinion of the i>ol;ce that some one
connected with the saloon knows more
about It than he is willing to admit.
It is the habit of Schou to place about
$50 in change in cigar boxes in various
places about his saloon. In one box was
about 523 in gold. In another $20 in nickels
for use in the slot machines, and the
balance of the money was la various de
nominations of silver. But the burglars
knew their business. They left the boxes
and took the coin.
V.'hen the morning oar keeper opened up
he discovered the robbery. Police officers
were called in and they found a peculiar
*tatÂ«Â» of affairs. The lock of the door on
the Seventh-street side of the saloon was
1 Tokenâ apparently from the inside. An
inner glass door was aiso smashed.
V.'hen the saloon was cleaned up for the
night, the bar was a picture of neatness.
In the morning it looked as if a picnic
had b^en held in the place. Schou sized
up the situation and philosophically took
in the -condition of affairs. While he
mourns the loss of his 550 05. the police
are trying to lay the blame where It be
lonjrs. Scnou Is not inclined to believ*
that any one connected with his place was
concerned in the burglary.
Celena Dupont. the pretty but wayward
daughter of Mrs. Nolan, who lives at 1013
M street. South San Francisco, attempted
suicide Tuesday evening by stabbing her
self with a butcher knife. But for th-i
fact that the blade was deflected by her
corset, she might have succeeded in her
attempt at self-destruction.
The young girl had serious objection to
being taken to the San Francisco Glrl3'
Training Home and wnen Officer McMur
ray of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children came for her she tried
to escape 'the confinement by suicide.
Miss Dupont was employed for many
years by the telephone company. She
had Â«. predilection for high life and took
every opportunity to enjoy herself. Her
mother saw that she could not control her
daughter, bo she reportea the case to, Sec
retary il. J. White of the Children's So
ciety. She Btated that her daughter had
informed her that she was working on
the night shift at the telephone office,
whereas she had left the corporation's
employ months ago, and was using the
subterfuge Xj> go out at night with bad
companions. Mrs. Nolan eaid she could
do nothing with her daughter, who was
under age, and expressed the wish that
she be placed In some institution.
Police Officer McMiaray visited the
home of the Nolans. Celena was very
Impudent to the officer and told him flatly
that he had no authority to take her
away. McMurray then ordered her to put
on her hat and accompany him, and the
girl went to her room. The officer thought
that the girl might escape by the back
way. but Mrs. Nolan relieved his fears
by telling him it was impossible. He
then suggested that she might do herself
an injury, and he had hardly expressed
the words when a shout was heard from
the kitchen. Mrs. Nolan's son cave the
warning and the mother and officer
niched into the kitchen to ascertain the
cause of the alarm. They then heard
moans from the adjoining room and Mc-
Murray grabbed a lamp and hurried in.
He found Celena lying on the bed with a
knife sticking in her body and for a mo
ment he was disconcerted. - He pulled the
blade out and a hurried examination dis
closed the fact that the girl had been
foiled in her attempt at suicide by a corset
steel. During the examioation Celena
fainted. When Bhe had recovered she
obediently donned her hat and accompa
nied the policeman to the Girls' Training
Home, of which she is Â¦ now an Inmate.
Her stepfather is employed by the Market
Street Railway Company.
WAYWARD GIRL
STUBS HERSELF
Ella. Countess Festciics de Tolna. will
henceforth be known as Eila Haggin, the
name of her childhood. She may now be
counted among the daughters of Ameri
can millionaires who have paid for a title
and found that the purchase price was
worse than money thrown awayâ the
price of misery. She has divorced the
Austrian nobleman whose love for the sea
exceeded his love for her. Had she chosen,
in partial compensation for. her experi
ence, she could have retained her right to
her title free from the burdensome pres
ence of the man who conferred It upon
her. But the emptiness of a title is now
apparent to her and she chooses to resume
the name she was known by as a girl.
The final decree has been sicned and
placed on record. In this decree the

Those jurors whose names are not en
rolled under the certificate of the County
Clerk will receive no consideration at the
hands of the Legislature and their present
claims will/be lost.
The presentation of the matter to the
Legislature â¢will resolve Itself into two
Issuesâ the formation of a bill amending
the old one regarding fees and of a new
one to designate the fund from which they
shall be drawn, and legislation to secure
an appropriation for those demands now
due and payable.
The action was heard in the Superior
Court and judgment given against the
jurors. The Supreme Court sustained the
Judgment of the lower tribunal, holding
that while the statute allowed criminal
jurors $2 per diem, through some over
sight of the legislator who presented the
bill no provision was contained in it fix
ing the fund from which the fees were
payable.

CLAIMS OF JURORS FOR UNPAID
FEES TO GO BEFORE LEGISLATURE
A circular letter has been sent to all
jurymen who have sat In criminal casca
In this city, Informing them that steps
are being taken to present their demands
for fees, of which there are many hun
dred and some amounting to that number
of dollars, to the Legislature, with a view
to obtaining an appropriation for their
liquidation as legal claims against the
city and county.
This will be good news to the claimants,
who had about given up hope of ever see
ing the $2 per day which they think they
should receive.
About a year ago the Auditor refused to
audit the demands of trial jurors In crim
inal cases. These demands amount an
nually to many thousands of dollars. Un
der the statute the jurors claimed $2 per
diem while sitting on a case.
The claimants thereupon associated and
retained the legal services of Attorney

The United States has two watchmen

HE School Directors are in a per
jl plexing predicament.
I They have elected Mrs. Kincaid
JJL to be their worthy president, and
tn the doing of it they have
tangled themselves up in a parliamentary'
and grammatical problem as intricate as
one of their own catch questions at a
quarterly examination.
How shall they address Mrs. Kincaid?
What title is hers by virtue of her high
office and in accordance with parlia
mentary law? These are the questions
that are puzzling the educators and mak
ing them sincerely thankful that they are
not required by the charter to pass a civil
service examination before they may hold
office.
It was Casserly. the gallant of the board
and the accepted authority on "How to
address a lady," that started the dispute.
When Mrs. Kincald was elected president
of the board the Directors naturally looked
to him to do the polite and congratulate
the lady In a manner worthy of them and
of her. Casserly knew exactly what was
expected of him and advanced with his
best bow and Burlingame smile. But he
got no farther. For the first time in his
life the beau fell down in his specialty
and was obliged to turn to others for ad
vice and assistance.
"What do I call her?" he asked In a
frightened stage whisper. That was all
he said. His fellow Directors recognized
the serious problem they had to deal with
and went at once Into secret session.
Exactly what passed behind the closed
doors will never be known, but the tat
tling little bird that hears all things has
chirped something about "Mrs. Presi
dentess." "Madam Chairwoman" and also
a curious bit about asking the lady to
dress for the part so that they might har
monize the mixture of the sexes in the
euphonious "Madam President,"
Yesterday found the board" In exactly
COUNTESS FESTETICS DE TOLNA

with all unnecessary formalities. If they
should -find it necessary to address ms
formally, I believe ihey should addres3
m"e as Madam President. That is the
form in common usage in all woman's
clubs. I consider the term president a
generic one and applicable to woman as
well as man."
Director Denman bristled up when The
Call representative sought for knowledge
as to the proper way to address Mrs. Kin
cald. "Do you want to cover this board
with ridicule?" said the handsome, white
haired Director. "Somehow this question
makes one think of a poor frog in a pond
and a little boy throwing stones at him."
After some little while, when Denman
had been convinced that even if there
were a frog in a pond there was no boy
with stones, he declared himself in favor
of woman in office, aaid he saw no "Im
propriety" in Mrs. Kincald being chosen
president of the board and madeÂ©i few
side remarks about the $3000 taxes He paid
out annually, but with the smiling tact of
a diplomat he steered clear of the ques
tion before him. "It's nonsense," he said,
and he positively refused to commit him
self.
Mrs. John Pettee, a iady who has seen
much active service 'In her capacity of
president of various charitable and hu
mane organizations, when questioned on
the subject declared in favor of Madam
President.
"They call me Madam President." she
said, "and I like It. It has such a lovelv
sound that I declare at once in favor of
It."
Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster when ap
proached with the perplexing question
decided immediately in favor of Madam
President. "There is no sex In office,"
said Mrs. Eyster. "Man Includes woman,
although I believe some men preclude wo
man. I should address Mrs. Kincaid as
Madam President."
Mrs. Lovell White, the president of tha
California Club, said that Madam Presi
dent was, according co usage, the proper
fashion in which to address Mrs. Kin
cald. "I confess I am at sea. I only
know that it is right bv virtue of common
usage and euphony."
the same indefinite state as existed before
the secret session. Mrs. Kincald, Mr.
Mark. Mrs. Denman and Mr. Casserly
spent the morning in visiting the schools
In the outlying districts and fighting shy
of the troublesome question during recess
time. At 3 o'clock they were on duty at
the board roomsâ all except Casserly.
When Inquired for the Information was
given out that Mr. Casserly had gone to
consult Mr. Greenway and Peter Martin
on most Important business and would
probably not return during the afternoon.
Mrs. Kincald, the first lady In the State
to occupy the office of president of a mu
nicipal body, has after the fashion of her
sex disposed, of the vexed question in a
manner if not according to law and gram
mar quite satisfactory to herself.
"I have disposed of that question eas
ily." said. tha lady. "I propose that the
board confer no title whatever upon me
and Just call me plain Mrs. Kincald.

Sailors and Officers Tell of How Dis
aster Occurred Which Nearly
Gave Shipful to Davy
Jones.
The Investigation commenced yesterday
before local Inspectors of Steam Vessels
Boiles and Dolgcr of the loss of the steam
schooner Iaqua on Duxbury reef in the
stonu of January 4 developed, if the
stories to!d by the witnesses examined are
true, the fact that due care bad been ex
ercised In the handling of the vessel, and
that her destruction was owing to un
avoidable conditions prevailing at the
tln:e.
Much of the interrogation was held with
the object of brir.girtr out just what
course the vessel was tieering at the time
she struck, and how sne came to follow
the north channel BO tar up the coast
when her destination was San Diego. Ac
cording to the story lold by Alfred Ncl
*or., the second mate, the course was laid
wp^tcrly-r.ortii. 11. Siraonson, the sailor
who was at the wheei when the crash
rarr.e, corroborated the testimony of Ncl-
F.on as to the course tieered. Slmonson
had bee:i at the wheei only ten minutes
before the Iaqua struck. He had relieved
Tolstrum. the sailor who was drowned,
at C o'clock.
First Mate Theobald Dnerback was on
the bridge at the time the vessel struck,
lie said he did not think they were hug
pirp the reef too closely. He saw small
breakers a little time before the vessel
rnmrided. IDu<riÂ»ack leciared that every
thing occured so quickly that he had no
time to do anything to save the Iaqua
From the rocks. He attributes the disaster
Â¦i i tie strong current or undertow setting
toward the reef, a_ri<J the fog. When he
-:nne on watch 2105 h'ne was said about
'Â¦ rcakers. Nelson staled that the ship
iiM not seem to steer well.
The testimony of William Burrill. the
vngineer, was to the effect that the Iaqua
was steaming ahead at from eijjht and
one-half to nine knots an hour. He was
at the lever live minutes before the
Ktrnclc When the vessel grounded on the
rocks he received no orders to ston his
rnchies. which ran for fifteen or twenty
minutes after the first shock. About half
an hour before the disaster the feed Dine
â¢ â¢11 the port boiler had broken, cutting off
t!i*Â» supply of water. At almost that time ;
the captain had inquiied how the engines
were running. Burrill also testified as to
leaping into the lifeboat, with the two
!-a:!orf, one of whom was drowned. Th*
boat capsized when about fifty yards j
from the vessel.
ThÂ«* skipper of th* wrecked craft. J.
Bash, told of leaving San Francisco,
bound for San Diego, at 4:30 o'clock on the- [
afternoon of January 4. The course was :
laid half a point farther north than was
usual on account of the high southwest
wind and the mist. At 5:55 the c.ourss
was set for the lightship. Fifteen minutes
later the disaster occurred. On being re
called the captain said that when he went
upon the bridge after the mate had called
him hp saw breakers and thought it was
the Potato Patch. He altered the course
and hauled off, thinking he was making
the north channel, coon after the ship
felt the Duxbury's teeth. Asked as to
how the vessel got ihcad of her loc and
Ir.side her course, the captain blamed the
extraordinary current. "My courses have
always come out correctly." he said. The
value of the Iarjua was $70,000 and it was
covered by insurance, the captain test!- |
ti*>d.
The watch at the forecastle head. Ed
ward Poisen. said that he did not see any
breakers until the Iacua struck.
Captain Jessen of the Eureka told of
the "how d'ye do?" tooting of the Iaqua's
siren as he passed her inbound. He said
that It was the habit of coasters to shave
the Duxbury pretty closely. The inves
tigation will be continued to-day, when
export testimony from coasting captains
v.ill probably be taken.
