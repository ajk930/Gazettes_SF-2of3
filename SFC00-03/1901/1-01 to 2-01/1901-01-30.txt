KINO'S LATE RESIDENCE.
It "Will Probably Be Purchased for
the Duchess of Marlborough.
LONDON, Jan. 29.â There is a great deal
of surmise as to what disposition will be
made of the King's late residence. Both
the King and Queen Alexandra are de
voted to Sandrlngham, so his Majesty
probably will retain that place, but It la
thought Marlborough House will be given
up. In the event of the Duke and Duchess
of York not desiring to reside there it Is
considered likely that William K. Vander
bilt will purchase the place for the Duke
and Duchess of Marlborough. which the
Duchess has long desired.
In official circles here the Vorwaerts'
story Is characterized as a gigantic hoax.
not only due to a desire to bid farewell
to his dying grandmother, but still mort
to the Prince of Wales' urgent wish to
settle a private debt affair to j the Em
peror before ascending the throne. This
debt, the Vorwaerts asserted, amounted
to 21,000.000 marks, which Emperor Fred
erick," immediately after beginning his
reign, loaned the Prince of Wales In
order to place the latter In a position to
pay accumulated debts to the amount of
24.00.000 marks. The loaned - money. It
was further . asserted, was part of the
savings. -amounting to 56.000,000 marks.

McAliFter, Campbell and Death were
then told to stand up. McAHster and
Campbell looked extremely pale, and

greatly under the strain.

day for sentence by Judge Dixon.
McAllFter. Campbell and Death were
*aoh sentenced to thirty years' imprison
ment at hard labor, and Kerr to fifteen
years' imprlfonment at hard labor. The
sentences are the full terms of imprison
ment which the law provides.

A few minutes after court had been de
clared open McAHster. Campbell and
r>*>ath were brought in by Deputy
Sheriffs.
The proceedings began with a plea by
Michael Dunn, one of the attorneys for
the convicted men. for clemency for his
clients. He urged that in the cases of
r>*Â»ath and Campbell the question of their
reformation was worthy of consideration
by the court. He presented a petition
!=!pmed by many citizens asking for mercy
for Campbell, who had been known for
many years by the petitioners as indus
trious, temperate and of good character.
Former Judge Scott addressed the court
The four prisoners were promptly re
moved from the courtroom after shaking
hands with their counsel and a few
friends.
"The evidence in this case does not say
that you helped In administering the drug,
but participated in the ravishment of the
girl. In one respect your case is worse
than the others. You were older and had
more obligations for virtue. You had a
wife worthy of the highest affections and
children for your concern, but you* dis
regarded all and permitted yourself to
drift awayfrom(Â«Â«pMper domMtie^llfe
and now'youstand here a wreck of vice
and crimeâ and such a crime! No wonder
it shocked the community and startled
every womanly and manly heart. That
pitiless ride, that dastardly outrage, the
poor victim laid dead by the roadside, re
gardless of whether she would be found
by kind friends or by beasts. How gladly
would I spare your relatives, but in the
exercise of my duty I cannot withhold
anything which the sentence of the law
requires. The sentence of the court is
that you be imprisoned In the State prison
at Trenton for a term of fifteen years at
hard labor."
Judge Dixon at once proceeded to pass
sentence. He said, addressing the pris
oner:
"There Is no one who can say that the
prisoner has not been honorable In his
past relations and that he has not been
a peaceable citizen."
George Kerr was then called to the bar
and by his attorney entered a plea of non
vult contendere to the charge of assault.
In entering the plea counsel asked the
court to exercise clemency. He spoke of
the prisoner's father, said now to be dying
as a result, at least In part, of the trouble
into which the son had fallen: of his sis
ters, wife and six children, one of the lat
ter only two months old, and concluded
by saying:
of virtue^ and honor. The sentence of
the cour/ is that each of you be Im
prisoned In the State prison at hard
labor for a term of thirty years."

LONDON. Jan. 29.â King Edward
VII and the Duke of Cambridge
arrived In London at 3 o'clock to
day. A large crowd welcomed tho
Â¦'v King at Victoria station. His
Majesty will finally approve pf the funeral
arrangement during the afternoon.
The .Earl Marshal, *he Duke of Norfolk,
was unable to see King Edward In order
to obtain his Majesty's final sanction for
,the funeral arrangements. Nothing, there
fore, has been definitely settled except
the programme for Friday, already
cabled.
"Queen Victoria's explicit directions. a3
to her funeral were written In 18G2," says
Truth x , "and have not been altered In aay
material respect. It was her wish th.it
the ceremonial should copy j that of
Prince Albert's burial as far as possible.
The Queen will be 'the first English sov
ereign who will not be burled at night
and by torchlight." '
The War Office has Invited colonial offi
cers and soldiers In England to take part
in the funeral 1 procession. Minute guns
will be fired from all ships In the Solent
and at Cowes, commencing when the Al
berta-leaves Trinity pier. Each ship will
cease firing. immediately after the end of
the procession passes her. When the pro
cession has passed the battleship Majestic
the forts and ships in Portsmouth har
bor will commence firing minute guns and
will continue to do so until the Alberta 5s
alongside. No standards will be displayed.
Ensigns and Union Jacks will be half
masted. Admirals' flags will be fully
hoisted.
As the procession passes each ship its
crew will present arms and then rest
upon reversed arms until the procession
has gone, the band meanwhile playing
funeral marches.
This morning there wn- a rehearsal
along the route of the funeral procession.
The eight Hanoverian horses which wUl
draw the gun carriages took a heavilv
laden brake, estimated. to be of the weight
of the gun carriage and coffin, over thÂ»
route. Numerous carriages followed and
a number of mounted men representing
the foreign princes and others who will
ride In the procession.-
It has been arranged that the Eton boys
will line the route frcm.tho Long/ Walk
gates to Castle! while the mili
tary' KnlghtsTof .Windsor will be on duty
In tho chapel' during/the funeral services.
It'is now understood, the funeral In Lon
don , will . be ; approximately as follows:
A sovereign's escort of one hundred Life
Guards, the massed bands of three regi
ments of Foot Guards. Field Marshal Earl
Roberts and . the headquarters staff, an
army gun carriage with the body. th-Â»
King, supported by the German Emperor,
the- King of Portugal and other reigning
sovereigns in the order of precedence; the
Dukes of Connaught and York, the equer
ries and aides de camp In attendance on
royal personages. Queen' Alexandra, tho
Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,.an<1
other royal princesses. In four carriages,
deeply draped, and. n.t the rear of tho
procession, another sovereign's escort of
one hundred Life Guards. It Is estimated
that sixty royal princesses will participate
In the procession.
As the funeral will be of a mllltarv
character, there 'probably will be no pall
bearers, though possibly at "Windsor cer
â¢taln generals will act In this capacity
while the coffin Is being carried up. the
nave of St. Geonre's Chanel.'

The third principle is the matter of the
big public debt for the Island. Here the
Spanish bonds come In. Such a debt must
be limited. A big public debt.with conse
quent obligations' to possible various na
tlons would be regarded as a constant
menace and a probable-basis for war.
Next, the United States, after all the
trouble It has had over Cuba has no ide.i
of permitting the. Cubans to enter- inro
treaties that will be obnoxious and unfair
to this country, either of a commercial or
other nature.
In some manner, either Jn the constitu
tion or in negotiations, the result of which
must be guaranteed by the convention
and people, the Cubans must pledge them
selves to three important principles. The
first of these concerns the right to declare
war. It Is asserted that the United States
cannot permit the Cubans to embroil
themselves in trouble with any nation to
the possible great danger of thjs country.
Therefore, In plain language, there must
be some kind of supervision of the war
making right of tho fighting Cubans.
It Is undoubtedly the desire of the Presi
dent that there shall be sojne documo-it
that will forever show that this country
has not been Ignored. Without some such
provision the Cuban convention would
have been called in vain, , as its work
would not be accepted by the Government.
Cuba's relations to this country must not
be such as will allow the possibility of for
eign Interference and of turmoil to the
detriment and worry of this Government.
President Mcklnlcy and. his advlsei?
are reÂ«ot#<vd^ti&t Cuba- must i not -b*>~t 6otÂ»
loose - In â¢ the matter of her International
relations: that she must not be vested
with power to engage in war which would
prove detrimental to the Interests of this
Government, and that the United States
must take reasonable precautions against
any such entanglements . on the j part of
Its ward.
The Cabinet was of the opinion that Its
first duty toward Cuba, which consisted
of pacification and restoration of order
on the Island, having been performed, the
problem now confronting Congress and
the President was to establish the stab>
government referred to In the Cuban reso
lutions adopted nearly three years ago.
The Cuban constitutional convention w;'.l
try. of course, to map out that form rt
government, but before it becomes oper
ative It must be submitted to and ap
proved by the United States.'
While the deliberations were necessarily
tentative in their general character, one
conclusion was reached. It was thit
whatever form of government might be
established In the Island, the United
States must always exercise a restraining
guiding: influence over Cuba and its peo
ple. The exact character of these rela
tions, from an International or legal stand
point, it would be difficult now to define,
but the power exercised by this Govern
ment would be somewhat In the nature of
a protectorate.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29.â It would be

were quiet. With Foote they were stormy;
and through much of 'it all the -audience

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 29.â The vouchers
will show and Gaskill can tell
anything the Assembly committee
"On the Fourth of July." he said, with
growing . enthusiasm, we thought it
would be a good plan to 'Â¦ have a big:cele
brationâ a Fourth of . July ; celebration in
the heart of Paris;" so we hired Sousa's
band to play f or. us all the afternoon and
until late at night, and we paid the band
$1000 for, It, too.- This money; was made up
by ! subscription among ,the Calif or nians.
Then, in the evening, .we had a supper and
speeches and stnging, and we had four or
five thousand men in the rooms and 25.000
crasy Frenchmen r outside cheering â¢ the
'Star , Spangled Banner.' ' It did < more . to
advertise California than , anything ". else
that was done.' .Why, there are thousands
of .those Frenchmen v who think the United
States, is in -California." Â¦â¢â¢;Â¦â¢Â¦â¢ Â¦
r In answer to the question; "Did you re
main in ' Paris all the time?'-' Foote ?re
plied that Â» he Â¦ had . made \ the grand tour
visiting among other places Monte Carlo
where he -won money enough ; to pay s for
the trip. \? He also visited the battlefield 'of
Waterloo and , had a : long : argument with
an '-. Englishman: who ! was not ~ willing "â¢ to
give Napoleon sufficient) credit.- 1 Â» . -' -. â¢
~ About Gaskill' s ; salary,^ he said when > hÂ»
gofto Paris he was told'the' other Com-
This ' apology was accepted and : then
the committee got down to business..
Mr. -Foote described the public entertain
mentsUhey had;
"If you had been away doing what you
could to carry out the plans and serve the
Interests of the State, and came home: to
meet such a reception as this, you would
not blame a Â¦ man, when > he â¢ had his â¢ first
chance to get back at those who were
slandering him." â¢
There was more. in a similar vein, and
finally Foote stopped.more from lack of
breath and rising rage than from any
paucity of adjectives or invective. Then
Treadwell, who had been trying for some
time to get a word In edgeways, said he
did not think the committee should listen
to such /language, as the members were
only doing their duty and should not bo
compelled to hear themselves Included in
such denunciation. He said if there was
any more of the same kind he would take
it as -^ a personal insult.' â¢ Foote quieted
down and excused himself in this way:.
.'.-. Foote's statement was long, and strong
and comprehensive. He wanted an inves
tigation, he said, and he had told the
Governor so. The Governor had letters
to show this, letters that any one might
see, * he- declared, not realizing that tho
.Governor -had been keeping these same
letters very quiet. If there had been any
thing" wrong In the management of; the
commission- he wanted to know of it, and
if there had been any misappropriation
of the fnmls ' he was as anxious as the
committee to find out who had gone
wrong.: . . â¢ Â¦
i,-."l; want charges made here," he de
clared,"'definite cha/ges, and not anony
mous ones, and I. Will send the man who
makes -them to 'the penitentiary for per-
Jury.j; I have never been accused of dis
honesty, and any one who accuses me now
lies." -Every dollar the commission ever
spent, can be accounted for by vouchers,
and I- dan' account for 514,000 more of my
own money that has gone with It. I. didn't
want. ; to :be ;-a Paris Commissioner.. I
wante4;to go-.to Paris as a private .clti
zen;-and^if I >ha'd done so it would'.not
have cost me as much- as it has. I de
clined-the appointment, but under pres
sure r J, took It. I have done what I
thought best, and'now to have dirty, filty,
vile slanders heaped upon me, anonymous
ly and maliciously, is something I will not
Stand." Â»
good times. And as for charges and coun
ter charges about personal conduct, the
committee will hardly go Into them, and
the Commissioners will not force matters.
Runyon wan the first witness called
after the resolution ordering the commit
tee to hold the investigation was read.
There were present Chairman Bliss,
Treadweil. Stewart of Amador, Melick,
Irving, Hasson and Brady, the full mem
bership of the committee. Treadweil and
â¢ Melick did most of the questioning, as
sisted by Stewart of Amador.
- But: it .was, when he got down to-Tru
man that Foote became really Interested.
"Why not call Truman and ask him how
much wine he took - away," the lawyer
shouted when he was asked .how much
wine was taken from the headquarters to
the Commissioners' rooms.- "Truman used
to take it out under his coatâ his coat all
buttoned up to hide it; .1 have seen him
do it fifty times, stealing wine like that
and iqe too./ He used to load his pockeis
up with ice until they leaked all over, his
clothes. I don't know how many times I
caught him stealing wine. I was not spy-
Ing on him. He could have taken it open
ly if he wanted to, as I did. Whenever
I wanted to take any wine I'just calhd
a fiacre, or a fiaster or a fiasco, or what
ever you call it, and told; the boy to load
it In. and make out a. bill. I paid for all
the wine I got and more, too. I paid for
some for Truman. Here I have the re
ceipt. 54 francs for three. bottles of Pom
mery* at 18 Â¦ francs a bottle. , .1 paid that
.because I. didn't "want any one to think
any. one of the Commissioners was drink*
ing wine he would not pay. for. and I saw
'ltuman drunk in : 'Henry's* and helpless
too, and s he " was drunk ' one morning at
breakfast and had not been to â¢> bed tho
nieht * before . at all. â¢. I , had trouble wÂ« t h
him all right. I soaked him three or four
timesâ good ones, too."' -.''-"* ,'^U .;
But here the committee .stopped thit
line . of testimony. â¢ v; â¢ vp u tnnt
Regarding Gustav, L. Hergefs - claim
that.the committee. owed him money for
a book, Foote made an explanation of thÂ«
whole, transaction, starting and endln Â»
with r the statement that "Herget "i%
crazy." : . â¢. ; . . .
Regarding the^ medals, Foote said that
if they were sold for $20. when they couM
have been had for $3 60,;. or 18 francs, then
tome one was stealing. -He did not know
anything about the matter. - . - ow
Â¦. Runyon's testimony 'brought: but 'littlj
light on the tangle.- Chairman -Bliss be
gan his examination 1 by reading. his ques
tions," for the most ' part " f romt a : prepared
list.' ,'After" several questions 'regarding
the Â¦ organization ' ; of the commission, - Bliss
asked:â.', ,â¢ ... ' : "?\:.',-/. .".;'-:;". -7
' Q.â Is" it . customary ': to Â¦- acknowledge : the : re
ceipt of exhibits? .A.â No, I think not. No let-
mlssioners had agreed to raise It from
$250 to $300, and so he agreed. He told of
the banquet to Mr. dc Young, which he
said was altogether in the hands of Tru
man and Gaskill, and he told of a lunch
eon he had given to Mayor Phelan, which
"was paid for out of my own pocket,
too." He said, he thoueht the act crea;
ing the commission- allowed the Commis
sioners to entertain, but when he was
asked what these 'entertainments cost ho
said the vouchers would show.
In regard to the awards, Foote said the
French style was to issue a certificate en
titling a man to a medal, and then if . ho
wanted the medal he could - pay for It
He suggested that Gafkill write to thoso
who had received awards and inform
them of this and procure medals for them
If they wanted them, and (Jnsklll had done
this; but Foote did not see how the com
missioners were concerned In the mat
ter, nor did he wish to be bothered with
it. It was not his business, he said. " The
names of those wlio received award)
were taken from the official list, and
among those names was that of N P
Chlpman, who made no exhibit. :â¢ Foote
said he did not know hpw. Chipman'*
name got there, but it was there. In tho
official list, bo he was written to as were
the others. Foote -3ald he did not know
where the money from those seeking med
als went to. He did not know anything
about the. money and did not "hold him
self responsible for it.
As to the exhibits, he did not understand
that any of them were to be returned,
and when he was shown a receiot'-for a
number of cases of wine. ; held I by - the
Southern California Wine Association and
signed by Gaskill, agreeing to sell the
wines receipted for and to make return
therefor, he said it was the first he knew
of any such. understanding,- and he could
not explain It.

ANOTHER COIiTTERENCE
ON CONFERENCE RULE
Assembly Will Again Attempt to
Beach an Agreement "With
the Senate.
CAL.L. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â Brown of San Mateo
reported in the Assembly this morning
that the Committee on Free Conference
on the joint rules had been unable to
agree with tha Senate committee, and on
his motion the committee was discharged.
Brown asserted that such a rule as tho
Senate insisted upon If In force In Con
gress would stop the wheels of legislation:
and that if unlimited free conferences
were prevented the Senate would be In a
position to dictate to the Assembly in
matters of legislation. .
Ralston said the Assembly had been re
ferred to as the steerage of the ship ftf
state, and the Senate was inclined to look
upon the Assembly as a body of secondary
importance. .He contended that tha As
sembly was under no obligation to rescind
a rule upon demand of the Senate â a rule
to which the Senate had agreed two years
a so.
Johnson moved that a new committee
on free conference be appointed. Jamea of
Los Angeles opposed further attempt for
the present to eonfer with the Senate in,
view of the Senate's refusal yesterday to
appoint' a^new -committee on â¢ free, Â¦â¢confer
ence. Johnson said in reply that the ap
pointment of 8v new committee- would put
the Assembly on record as being willing
to continue the attempt to reach an agree
ment. .
The motion for the appointment of a
new free conference committee was
passed.
o â But why did you Increase the salary In
stead of the allowance for expenses? A.â Well,
for efficiency.
Stewart of Amador asked some ques
tions, directing them mainly to the wit
ness' knowledge of exhibits of mining'
sDeclmens and oranges, which are alleged
not to have been returned to the exhibit
ors but Runyon had returned from Paris
too' early to have personal knowledge of
these matters.
The visitors books. Runyon continued,
would show how many people had called
at the heada: uarters ' but he had no idea
himself what the number was.
To questions by Melick. Runyon told
how a collective exhibit was the desire of
the commission, so that California could
compete with the world, but they were
compelled to scatter their exhibit through
the. United States exhibit. Regarding the
expenditure of the $116,000, Runyon sala
the money passed through Gasktll's
hands, but everything he did was passed
upon by at least two of the Commission*
ers. and they signed every draft or check.
The fact, was then brought out that the
commission has an expert working on the
book3; that there remains of the $130,000
$19,000, and against this there are charges
that will bring it down to $16,000. This
sum will be turned over to the State.
A letter from Mr. Emlay, one of the em
ployes of the commission, offering for a
certain sum to take Charge of a certain
exhibit, was read, but Runyon said he
knew nothing of that, and that the em
ployes of the commission were expected
to care for the exhibits without extra pay.
This evening the Governor, Commission
er Foote, Commissioner Runyon, Secre
tary "Gaskill and 'Mr. Bliss held a long
conference in Mr. Foote's rooms in the
Capital Hotel. â¢ â¢
After the conference it was announced
that it was merely a discussion over the
affairs of the commission; that the Gov
ernor is very friendly, personally, with
tho Commissioners, and he was only hav
ing afriendly talk with them. It was not
explained ' why the chairman of the- in
vestigating committee was included in the
conference.
To-morrow, it Is. understood, Gaskiil
will refer/the whole subject of the medalj
to Emlay. who will show receipts from
those issuing the medals for all sums he
received In response to letters. That
money was sent to Gaskill personally ia
explained by the fact that commis
sion, not being a corp6ratlon. could not
keep a deposit at any bank and there
fore financial business had to be trans
acted in the name of some oneâ In thi3

that the San Francisco delegation had had

the duty of the country members to stand

MEN'TO, Jan. 28.â The Republican As

on the question of patronage, of which
the over-zealous San Francisco members
made such a mess last week. As a re
sult of to-day's deliberations. Jacob Step

Geary probably will be jjlven place3, but
the question of the four "unattached"
porters is still in the air.
Some of the members complained that
they had not obtained appointments up to

Among these was Hourlgan, who has the
fifty cents yet coming which he refused to
give away or .risk in a dice game acalnst
a like amount of patronage. The problem

SHEBTDAU PBESENTS
A DIVOkCE MEASURE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 29.â Tha Senate Committee
on Apportionment met this evening and
Fettled the question of Assembly districts
âmuch to the dissatisfaction of Sacra
mento, however, for she will lose cne of
her present three. It was urged In ex
cuse for the cut that Sacramento I had
three Assemblymen to 46,000 population, or
one to 15,000, when the allotment is one
10 IS.000. Besides, it was urged that the ex
tra district is wanted elsewhere, and Sac
ramento can best snare it because the
Legislature is handy to her and at any
time her prominent citizens could run in
to committee meetings and look out for
themselves. The extra district was al
lotted to Mono, Alpine and Inyo, three
counties that have always been coupled
with others of different Interests and dom
inating population. They have 10,000 popu
latiun among them, but it was thought
they were entitled to an Assemblyman by
themselves. - â¢
The Senatorial districts are going in as
Cutters bill has them, except those of
Davis, Flint and Smith of Kern. Smith
may have to take Kern, Kings and Tulare,
ana Flint may be shifted from Monterey.
Ban Eenito, Stanislaus and Merced, which
counties are assigned to him by the Cut
ter bill. This proposed district Is con
tidered too unwieldy in size and too di
versified in interest. Davis is anxious to
pass Tuolumne to some one else, and he
may obtain a change.
There is a new scheme in Congressional
apportionment, this time coming from
Santa Clara, whose delegation has about
decided that its county does not want any
of the new Sixth District. The new Con
gressional district. It is proposed, shall in
clude Santa Clara, San Wateo. Santa Cruz.
San Eenito, Monterey. San Luis Obispo,
Santa Barbara and Ventura, all of which
but San Benito and Santa Clara are coast
counties. It would have a population of
about 171.000, or SitOO short, but it Is claimed
It will soon make up the deficit. The new
district is the outgrowth of a sentiment
that it is better to make one sure Demo
cratic district and seven sure Republican
districts, than eight presumably Republi
can districts with a close chance in two or
three of them. The plan suggested would
leave the central district, made up, of the
San Jbaauin Valley and the counties on
the eastern' line, hopelessly Democratic,
but all the others would be certainly Re
publican.
Al.imeda will not be allowed her eighth

MENTO, Jan. 29.â The Mining Commit
tee's substitute for the, Tyrrell (of Nevada)
Senate bill 127 was passed by the. Senate
this morning after a somewhat earnest
debate. The vote â¢was 28 to 1.. Roweil
alone voting in the negative.
The substitute bill appropriates $150,000
for the fund for the debris impounding
system on the Yuba. Its counterpart in
the Assembly is Irish's bill, which is now
before the Committee on Ways and
Means.
Rowell spoke against the bill, declaring
that dams were a temporary expedient,
dangerous to the pccple below them and
that money expended on them was thrown
away.
Cutter defended the bill. He recounted
the history of earlier appropriations and
referred to Colonel Heuer's statement
that Marysville is doomed unless the
dams be constructed. He said the tax
able value of Marysville property is 52,
000,000 and that it would be $5,000,000 if all
danger from debris were removed. The
proposed system has the approval of Gov
ernment engineers who have made a care
ful study of the problem.
Tyrrell of Nevada emphasized the im
portance of rehabilitating hydraulic min
ing. In the past, he eaid, great injury
had been inflicted on the valley below.
He referred also to the Governor's favor
able recommendations in his message.
Devlin supported the bill. He said that
hydraulic mining could not be carried on
profitably if the miners were obliged tc
restrain the debris. He emphasized the
importance of .maintaining the Sacra
mento River as a waterway and improv
ing it. Lardner and Shortridge also spoke
In favor of the bill. Â¦

he was awaiting the down steamer at
Halnes four men mushed out and told him
that from a epace four feet square on
Porcupine Creek dust worth $3000 was
taken out. He did not learn the number
of the claim, but thinks the men told the
truth. He met a number of men from
Bear Creek, in Chilkat district, and all
told of rich finds and. agreed that the
creek would prove wonderfully rich this
spring. Dawson papers tell of rich finds at

LYNCHING MAY
FOLLOW MURDER
LOXDOX. Jan. 29. â Once again the
rumor is abroad that Miss Paul
ine Astor, daughter of William
"Waldorf Astor, is -engaged to the
young Duke of Roxburghe, the
greatest matrimonial catch in all Eng
land, and once again it has been impos
sible to obtain a confirmation of the
rumor. Both sides refuse to discuss the
matter, but it is now fairly settled in the
public mind that where there is so much
smoke there must be fire. For which
very homely reason congratulations seem
to be in order to the' fair American who
has Janded such a good thing' in the peer
age.
The young Duke, who rejoices in the
name of Sir Henry John Innes-Ker, bears
in addition to the ducal title those of Mar
quis of Bowmont and Cessford, Earl of
Roxborghe, Earl of Kelso, Viscount Brox

be subject to further amendment, but
there was objection, and he contented
himself with. offering the amendments in
order that they might be printed. . One of
these limits contracts under the bill to
fifteen years instead of twenty, and gives
no premium for speed above eighteen

Before the session closed the committee
amendments were formally agreed to.
The Indian appropriation bill was passed
early in the day.
Perkins took exception to the provision
of the bill limiting the amount of subsidy
to go to ships built on the. Pacific Coaat
to 30 per cent of the whole amount. Frye
replied that no more had been asked be
fore the committee. He would be, sur
prised, he said, to find .the Senator from
California suggesting amendments to the
bill as now perfected In view of the fact
that as a member of the committee he
had voted for the bill when it was not
half as good as now. ... â¢
Replying, Perkins said -he had agreed to
the reporting of the bill, but that he never
would consent 19 giving subsidies to for
eign built ships. '
"Then," said Frye. "you will kill the
bill." â¢
"Oh. no," replied Perkins, "I will vote,
for it.". '-Â¦'..'
Frye said his only purpose at this time
in requesting.action upon the amendments
was' to get the bill- in perfect shape and
that there was no idea of preventing op
portunity to Senators to offer other
amendments. The amendments hereto
fore suggested were then formally agreed
to.

sidles. This country was preparing to pay
almost half as much, when It is admitted
that our tonnage is not one-hundredtn
part of the tonnage oÂ£ the world. He" ar
gued that outside of the vicious principle
of the bill the greatest objection to it la
found in the fact that it will retard in
stead of advance American shipbuilding.
The result of such leclslatlon would be
that shipowners would build ships'Â«for for
eigners far more cheaply than they would
build American vesselo. He asserted that
the proposed subsldv. would amount to
more than ten and a half per cent on
the capital invested in shipping. The ship
owners, he paid, never would consent to a
division of this bonus with the shipbuild
ers.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29.â Senator Frye
gave notice in the Senate to-day that he
intended to keep the shipping bill to th*
front even as against appropriation bills,
not yielding to them without a vote. It
revealed a disposition on the par*, of the
Senate leaders to force a vote on tha
measure, whether it will pass at this ses

GER THE CITY BY UNWISE INTERFERENCE IN STATE AFFAIRS.
Continued on Page Five.
are concerned, we are silent until the Legis
lature has adjourned. We want to use our
force and your force In the legislative halls
at Sacramento In order to get remedial laws
such as the New York law Is, and If that Is
not done, then the question may be precipi
tated in the .board for this.. board tf> decide
what it will do with reference t<x the City and
"County- of San Francisco. That I cannot
speak for them about. The members of the
Hoard of Supervisors during the last year
have been the custodians of their own con
sciences, and they vote as they please. But
I know that they are amenable to reaaon and
sound Judgment.
Memorial to Legislature.
"The memorial ts the Legislature of the Board
of Supervisors Is not the only form In which
that body at Sacramtntb is considering the
racing question. Mr. Belshaw and ah Assem
blyman have Introduced a bill forbidding pool
sf-lUiiK /in.l bookmaking in the State of Cali
fornia anywhere outside of the lnclosure of a
track or athletic club whern contests between
beasts or between men are going on. , I am
satisfied that It Is a good bill and should.be
enacted Into a law. It Is a step In the right
direction. But there are. Â¦ Some of you, es
pecially members of the clergy who feel that
you cannot afford to -compromise in the mat
ter, but the practical politician knows that â¢ If
he cannot get all that he a?ks ho must be
content with what he can gÂ«t and If It is in
the right direction we consider that something
has been ealhed." ! â¢ . , .
The- Mayor continued In this, strain at length
and with considerable repetition, and con
cluded by calling upon the Ilev. Dr. Rader
for his Â« views. That gentleman responded,
laying; .v Â¦:
iDt. Rader Gives His Views.
"I recognize the fact that annually this
whole subject of gambling comes before the
people of this city and the State of California.
It Is due to the fact that local option doe3
not seem to solve the question of gambling. I
personally very much wish that there might
be a uniform State law passed by our Legis
lature controlling this' whole matter and sup
pressing the . in oft disastrous aspects and In
fluences of gambling at our *acetracks.
"It has not seemed possible In thepast tosolve
this question in our own vicinity. If we t cloee
Ingleside track Its owners move across' the
bay or into â¢ San Mateo County, and we have
the same evil In a different county close at
hand. A legislative act, without any holes in
it, or any strings to it, an act that the peo
ple will understand and recognize as being
the voice of the people. It seems to me, would
exercise a very wholesome Influence on this
whole subject of poolrooms, So far as I under
stand it 1 do not agree' with the law recom
mended by the Board of Supervisors.
Wants Ordinance Enlarged.
"I would agree with the recommendation to
this extent: that we enlarge , the present
ordinance of this city with reference to pool
rooms, and Instead of making It a municipal
ordlhance, enlarge into .a State statute. It
seems to me that this ordinance with which
we closed the gates of Ingleside and by the
authority of the people and the 3jrvelllance
of the Police Department have beTn enabled
very .successfully to close every poolroom. In
San Francisco, has been sufficiently success
ful to warrant an application of the sajne stat
ute in every county and municipality in the
State. I . very much wish that " something
might be done that would be more effectual
than has been done thus far, and that we
might nere to-night meet upon ftomo common
ground, instead -of antagonizing one another,
and take a ''stand upon it and act upon it In
the interest of the people at large. t
"There are tko or three things we are agreed
upon, I think, as citizens. The first in that
Ingleside Â«rm|l never again' be Â¦ opened ns a
gambling .resort. The people of tnis city
1 will venture .to pay will not permit that.
And I think that we are agreed here to-night
that the old regime of poolroom gambling and
bookmaking, the old regime of Ingleside, that
has been a festering sore -to the body politic
of this city ' so lone shall never again be re
vived. I - speak. I am sure, for thousands of
people In this city when I nay that we earnest
ly, strongly ' and Â¦ persistently v protest ' against
{Ay measure that will open the gates of Ingle
siae fts a gambling resort. Â¦ We are agreed, j it
seems to me, upon that. The question that Is
before us this evening -Hsi How shall this be
accomplished?" Â¦ .. y
Rabbi Uleto's Criticisms.
Rev. Dr. <N!eto next addressed, the meeting
upon; the invitation of the Mayor. He criti
cized the newspapers for publishing. full par
ticulars of all sporting. events, saying that he
did not sec- the; fairness of asking the clergy
tnv speak repeatedly against' the evil Â¦ undec
discussion while- at the. same time, giving the
young people who .were trying to learn true
morality from . the ministers all the informa
tion that allured them to crime. "So far as, I
am concerned,"' said he, "\yhat I have learned
from my . fellow-men, not- gained by opinion
or .Information from 'books or Â¦Â¦ from news
papers, is this: "Â¦Â¦.- 'Â¦-*.Â¦Â¦Â¦- . '
.-' -VThat among the, vast number of people who
Inhabit thla world (there are men who like'lo
enjoy this : peculiar thlner called gambling. But
I wish 'to pay thlsabout it: 'That no 'State In
this Union dare put itself on record as acknowt-
edging that there shall be such a thing under
Its laws as gambling. While the enactment >f
the Legislature may very well regulate racing.
it dare not mention gambling and bookmaking..
This city hag already by ordinance put U<Â«
stamp and seal' of condemnation . upon gam
bling. ..We have made mistakes in the- past In
this matter, and doubtless we shall make mis
takes again, and when we have passed any
enactment, no matter how stringent It may be,
we shall doubtless find that men will discover
a means for eluding the law. But we must go
on persistently In our iflorts. It Is our dutv
to prevent them from adopting such methods as
will destroy the peace and harmony of our
community and will blacken us In the eyes <J.'
the world. '
"This limitation, that Is proposed upon the
New York plan cannot blacken us In the eyes.
of any sensible people at all. But the Legis
lature must never enact any'law by which !t
officially recognizes gambling, betting, book
making or. pool-selling.'' " . .j
This sentiment provoked a genuine outburst
of applause, the first of the evening.
Position of The Call.
John D. SpreckeU then addressed the meet
ing as follows:
"I did not come here for the purpose of dis
cussing racing at all. but simply to correct a:
Impression that prevails in the city to some
extent, having been created through the agency
of one paper and through the remarks of the
Mayor this evening, and that is that Mr. Leake
is conniving with Mr. Williams to keep open
the racetrack In Oakland. I want to say rlgnt
here that whatever course has been taken by
The Call or by Mr. Leake was taken absolutely
and only Under my Instructions, r have been
opposed to this gambling for two years past.
Two years ago I instructed Mr. Leake that he
should do everything he could to eradicate this
vice and defeat this gambling proposition." .
Supervisor Tobinâ May I ask you . a ques
tion?
Mr. Spreckelsâ Certainly. . :
Mr. Tobin â I would like to ask you If this
meeting passes a resolution Indorsing the ac
tion of- the Supervisors memorializing the
Legislature to restNct racing in each -county
for thirty days, will Trie Call support It?
Mr. Spreckelsâ The Call will- support that
proposition provided they eliminate the gam
bling feature of It.
Mr. Tobinâ That will eliminate the gambling
proposition.
Mr.- Spreckelsâ As I Understand the situation,
the Ingleside people can have as many races
as they please, and there is nothing to hinder
them from having races at the present time.
Mr. Tobinâ An amendment, was introduced
which was accepted by me and embodied In
the resolution expressly reserving to the Board
of Supervisors of each county the right to
restrict betting and racing at any time,
whether for thirty days, or- at any Other time.
So that. the resolution does not alter the condi
tions In this county or any other county In
the State at all, except,' as the Mayor says,
to prevent the Board of Supervisors of any
county from granting the privilege in any
county of racing- and bookmaking for a greater
period than thirty days.
Mr. Spreckelsâ My impression was that they
were permitted to race there at any time.
Mr. Tobinâ If my statement to you is cor
rect, then The Call will support a resolution
of that kind as 1 understand it?
Mr. Spreckelsâ It would support a resolu
tion to permit It for a, limited time, under
those circumstances.
Mr. Tobinâ To prohibit racing for a greater
length of time than, thirty days In any coun
ty In the 8tate? . â¢:Â¦ >
" Mr. Spreckelsâ Yes. sir. provided .It elimin
ated the gambling proposition. â¢ ...
Mf/'Toblnâ Exactly;- then The Call, would
support it? 'Â¦,".: /
Mr. .Spreckelsâ TeSj sir. '[ â¢*'.*.,.
. . Knight Pleads for Fair. '-Â¦;: v. J
George A? Knight next . addressed the meet-
Ing, announcing, at -the outsÂ«t,. "I am â¢frank
to admit that I appear here as the representa
tive of & stockholder in the Ingleside track,
and a taxpayer of the city and county of San
Francisco, who' has property that goes up Into
the millions. I refer ta. Chajles L. Fair. He has
invested in the Ingleisloe track. All I. know
of the object of this meeting is what I have
learned from tfce Mayor." ,
Mr. Knight then turned the batteries; of: his
satire upon the clergy, saying that the pres
ent controversy seemed to be a flght against
Individuals- rather than upoq principle, and
complaining that the newspapers had Influ
enced the clergy of thÂ» city, and that the lat
ter had united their, efforts and prayers to the
evil on one -side of the bay. and had not ex
tended it- to the same evil on the other side of
the bay..' If .the. ministers were going, to pray
against the evil ' he. Wanted- jthem to pray
against It impartially, from Del Norte to San
Diego. â¢ v - ' - ' "* ,
Rev. PhiUP Coombe - said : .Â« "I â¢ am > glad â¢ to
inform Mr. Knight that the clergy are ready
to take the 1 advice "he -gives. We are nere to
oppose racing In any fonrr and- anywhere. Our
services on Sunday night were held not in the
interest of any one track or against any one
track, - but ' against the evils of horseracing Â» in .
the entlra State' as Well as in, the; city and
county of San . Francisco. | As far as the clergy
are concerned we are Interested in working
against .this great', evil. We -do not .work
against any- particular track. But we believe
Supervisor Charles Wesley P v eed replied in t
personal manner to I>r. Wilson's remarks, a
portion of which he took to himself, denounc
ing the statement ao far aa it applied to htm
as untrue, and eulogizing at considerable
length the present municipal administration.
Supervisor Tobin also replied in a personal
manner to Mr. Wilson defending his own,
course and upholding- the administration. He
nnoily became so personal In his allusions that
the Mayor checked him. In conclusion b* said:
"It we can't prohibit thJa evil tie only thin*
to do Is to make tlw> Deriod In which It Is al
lowed as short as we can. I move, therefore,
aa the sense of this meeting, that the action of
the Board of Supervisors in passing the reso
lution under consideration be indorsed. an>l
that a copy of this resolution be sent lo tha
State Legislature.
Poniatowski Confesses.
The motion was seconded, but before being;
put Prince Poniatowgkl said he desired to ad
dress the meeting, saying: "I would only say
a few words, aa I feel that I ought to say
something, talking very calmly about the mat
ter, fcr the reason that three months ago I had
no interest in either Ingleslde. Tanforaa or
Emeryville. About three months ago It hap
pened that I was at dinner with Adolph Spreck
els and Henry Oxnard. both reputable gentle
men. I was induced by them to go Into an en
deavor to have fair and respectable racing. Wi
all -raise race horses and children both, and I
think equally well, and we made up our minds
that we would put in something like J3CO.0CO la
trying to get one or two racetracks where wÂ»
would try to keep the sport honest and clean.
WÂ« limited our Interest' on the money to 3
per cent. We started nearly three months ago,
and we have done our best. Really we are all
satisfied where we are at Tanforan.
"This matter which ia belnff agitated is on*
of Indifference to us. Â¦ This issue has beea
forced by a consideration In which horserac
ing has very little to do. I want simply tÂ»
say that wef are not simrly three men inter
ested in the matter, but there are about sev
enteen of us. and we are trying and will try
to keep things nice .and clean and respectabl*
as long- as we have control of It. We own
these two . tracks. Mo&t or these gentlemen
are large taxpayers, largo property-owners,
and we have the Welfare and good name of Â»
Pan Francisco at hearc dust an much as any
one of you this evepinÂ» v I{ there is any way
to restrict racing to ninety days or sixty
days and make it very good for a short time,
you will find us anxious to da anything wa can
to meet your views in^ tlnÂ» matter
"We are all willing that you should limit
the season to three months. If the Board at
Supervisors or the State Legislature or tha
Governor does not feel ajfoamed in
follow Â¦ the- methods of the older coun
tries, among them England. France. Aus
tria and ' Germany, and put the mat
ter lrÂ» the hands of* a committee of tvr<1
or three men. we would be content with that,
and then you will not ptrhapa drive out of
racing . the better dement. You can control
that if the Supervisors and the Mayor will
maintain the attitude which they have hell
toward this matter San Francisco, being
the principal city In the State and holding
tlfe position that it does, can set the pace
-for every other county In the State.
Rev. Frank S. Baker said: "I have always
found that in every undertaking', and especial
ly in every important reform. It is a danger
ous place to occupy to be on the fence. The
Mayor and the Supervisors were not cm the
fence a year or so ago; they were on the right
side of It, and I, for one, am In favor, of their <
Ftcylng on that side of the fence, and I am go
ing: to stay with them as lonsr as they stay
there. I want to say to Mr. Knlscht that I am
not narrow minded in my prayers; that I de
nounced this evil In Oakland when I was
pastor aver there as I denounce It now. I
want to say this, that gambling is wide open
in San Francisco, and we have more of It now
than we are able to handle. The police are
handcuffed In many places In our city. After
my denunciation of it last Sunday, the next
afternoon I took a brother clergyman, and in
nine places we were able to procure lottery
.tickets, and we found twenty-five or thirty
"white men in those places. If the Chief of
Police and his force are unable to cope with
the evil as It Is now. in the name of high
heaven why do we want to open Up more
places and allow more gambling?"
Rev. Mr. Doane said he sjx>ke as a minister
and a Native Son of San Francisco, whose
father was grand -marshal of the Vigilance
Committee in 185Â«. It raÂ» been said that the
object j of good government Is to make it as
hard as possible to do wrong and as easy as
possible t6 do right. What Is morally wron*
cannot possibly be politically right. I take
my stand upon that. We are placed here in
San Francisco to do what we can for, morality.
For Instance. I am opposed to all saloons. If
there is a saloon next to my home, shall I not
cry out. against that saloon, and with God's
help try to have it wiped out? That Is the way
I feel .concerning Ingleside. If those who will
gamble wish to cross the bay to Indulge in It.
let them go over there, and let those over
there who stand for morality rise up against' It.
We have all we can do to wipe out our own
iniquities. â¢ Â¦ ' -
Rev. Dr. E. Nelander In his remarks
harked back to the Insinuation of Mr. Knight
that the clergy were- partisan In Â¦ their pray
ers, saying: "I have heard this thing be
fore. I have also heard It Intimated that the
representatives of the Ingleside track" con
sidered this to be & good thing to work for all
It was worth because it was the only way
, in which they could disgust the clergy and
disarm the force of their attack. It.Js not
fair to try and divert us "from the main'Is
sue, which la not as between the . rival
racetracks. The issue is as to . whether In
gleside shall be opened again.
"I am not one of those who believe that It
la possible to eradicate vice entirely from the
great cities. I believe that that is a work that
men cannot accomplish. Hcfwever. I believe
that we should always work against alt evil
wherever it- 'Is seen and wherever It exhibits
Itself. The Mayor and the Supervisors were
well agreed upon this question some time ago
and we are yet to some extent agreed. I am
not In my own. mind 'at all certain that this
proposed thirty days' racing and pool-selling
at Ingleside is a thins to be desired."
Carnival of Gambling.
Rev. J. A. B. "VfiUon nest addressed thÂ«
meeting, in vigorous style and at considerable
length, saying among other things: "I came
to San Francisco when you were in the midst
of a movement looking to -better government.
I helped to put most of you here In the super
visorial chair. I did it in good faith. Even If
It proved that I bought a gold brick, gentle
men. I did* it In good faith. I thought I was
doing the best that could be done for good
government In San Francisco, and I hope you
will not make me change my mind. I am
getting tired of appealing to you gentlemen
constantly against one species of deviltry af
ter another. I appeal to you/gentlemen, how
ever, again that you give us a .better state
of thing*.
â¢ "We have been looking for It and hoping for
it. But I ask you if things are tny better la
San Francisco than th;y were three years ago.
I atn not a hireling here at all: I get no feÂ«
for my representation . of anybody here to
night. This argument ad homlnum that M
made here does not affect the question at Is
sue at all. It matters net whether Mr. Wil
liams or Mr. â¢ Leake. or anybody else la to be
Injured or is seeking revenue. â¢ I only want
to know what Is right on this question; and ! It
makes no difference whether any man or any
paper takes the right ground for one reaaon
or another. â¢ â¢ .
"I am ready to help" anybody who is striving
for the rlftht. and I' care not what are the .mo
tives of any paper or any man as long as they
will help me In the right direction. I came up
here a year or two ago on this same ques
tion. I came up here in *ood faith. I thought
I waa among the clean representatives of the
manhood of this Â«â¢â¢Â»-- who had been selected
to. put this city on a high plane. It. has been
on a low- plane. The name of this city has
been a synonym for municipal foulness. You
heard what my friend, Mr. Baker, told you
about Chinatown being wide open for gam-)
bllnÂ» undv the eyes of the policemen. .That
la true, bh you know. ' And that Is not all. (lo
downtown here to the Care Royal and see
what b goinr on there.
â¢ *'I can name a man on the police force to
day, a detective, and if you will give him a
dozen men of his choice out' of , your police
forco and authorize him to act. In thirty days
there will not be a gambling; hell ocen in
Chinatown. I will risk my life on that if you

Then If you give him the 'authority he will

men and young women are ruia^d. lit us

Standard and Instead of giving some sort of
Indorsement to this vice and giving the Leg
islature an opening to fasten this sort of thing
on us. In the name of God let ua Â»et our
faces against the whole buslnÂ«Â«Â«." .
Spreckels said that naturally he was op
posed to gambling anywhere and that The
Call would Indorse any suggestion for
Jiorperacing if the element of gambling
were omitted.
Then came one of the surprises, and.
from the point of view of Mayor Phelan
and his Tobin satellite, an unfortunate
one of the evening. George. A, Knight
asked the privilege of the floor and de
clared that he represented Charles L.
Fair, a racing man and millionaire tax
payer. With that preliminary Mr. Knight
proceeded bitterly to arraign every min
ister who had ventured to fj>enk on the
ground that ministerial denunciation of
Ingleside, Just as it is, is unfair in that
It doe's not also Include denunciation of
similar evils.
"You cannot stop gambling," said Mr.
Knight. "You have a vice which is ages
old. Now, be fair. Denounce other race
tracks and we are all with you."
This remarkable admission upon the
part of Mr. . Knight, acting as an attor
ney, admitting that the* interests he repre
sented were vicious, but. pleading indul
gence because similar vldousness was not
suppressed, created something of a sen
sation. â¢Â»
"Protect What We Have."
Mr. Knight was followed by Rev. Philip
Coombe of the Richmond Congregational
Church, who begged the Supervisors to
preserve, the splendid position now occu
pied by this city and not Jeopardies it by
trying, without warrant and without au
thority, to cleanse other cities which are
suffering from an evil which we de
stroyed.
"The only duty of this municipality Is
to protect what we have and keep it," he
said. "As for others, we will do the best
we can for them. We are praying for
them all. even those whom Mr. Knight
represents."
Supervisor Tobin insisted on. being the
infant terrible of the night' and'asked the
reverend gentleman a question. He was
answered by another, which silencedhlm.
"Would you object." asked Supervisor
Tobin. "to thirty days of racing?"
"I would," was the reply, "because that
would he an entering wedge, for ninety
days, and I can see no logical reason in
asking for thirty days of moral disease
when now we have not one.".
Supervisor Tobin resumed his seat and
Rev. Dr. F. K.. Baker, pastor of the First
M. E. Church, took the floor. He warned
the Supervisors earnestly, eloquently and
brilliantly of the danger of being on the
wrong side of the fence or on it. He said
that San Francisco, in closing Ingleside
and keeping it closed, is on the right side
of the fence, and why now Jeopardize It
by going beyond the province of the peo
ple of San Francisco and interfering in
affairs which do not concern us.. We are
opposed to every form of gambling, and
Btill we have gambling wide open In this
city. Why take upon our shoulders an
other burden of gambling when we can
not get rid of that which we have?
One of the most eloquent addresses of
the evening was delivered by the Rev.
Mr. Doane, who declared that the city is
now free from the racetrack evil and
should strive to koep itself free.
"We do cry out," he safd, "against evil
In every form and in every place, but Is
It not natural that we protect ourselves
against the evil which Is at our doors?
Jf Â«one of our people will insist upon
gambling and go to Oakland to gamble,
let the good people of Oakland drive them
out. I have heard much to-night about
the breeding of horses. In God's name,
should no attention be paid to the breed
ing of men?"
The chambers of the Supervisors rang
with applause when the reverend gentle
man concluded and the Rev. Dr. Dins
more, pastor of the Second Unitarian
Church, followed him. Dr. Dinsmore
urged the Supervisors to leave well
enough alone. He said he was a lover of
horses and would indorse a proposition to
memorialize the Legislature for thirty
days of racing, but absolutely with tho
element of gambling cut out. Rev. Mr.
Thonias spoke In the same strain.
The Rev. E. Nelander, pastor of the
First English Lutheran Church. beggei
the Mayor and the Supervisors not to Da
unfair and not to divert attention from
the only Issue which can concern the peo
ple of San Francisco.
"That Issue is," he said, "shall Ingle
side be opened? And the. decent, self
respecting, home-honoring people of. this
city declare, that it shall not be opened
for thirty daysâ not for thirty minutes."
The Rev. John A. B. WlSn pas-tor of
the Howard-Street M. E. mad.j
an eloaucnt, extended address. He de
clared that he was no attorney paid to
represent the people for whom he spoke.
He declared that he represented men and
women who will not have their monies pol
luted by surethlng gamblers and their
methods. He denounced gambling in it4
various forms and pleaded with his hear
ers not to Indorse the scheme Involved Â«n
the memorial to the Legislature. He said,
that an indorsement el this memorial i3
a â¢ violation of a principle which decent
men cannot support. It Is a sanction of
gambling and gives to the Legislature the
privilege of making that gambling as lon^j
as it pleasesâ for 365 days a year, if neces
sary.
Dr. Wilson was followed by Supervisor
Hotallng, -who devoted considerable time
to a learned discussion .on millinery and
a denunciation of the ministers present.
Supervisor Reed occupied a few minutes
with an explanation, and Isidore Jacobs,
claiming to represent business men.
spoke for what he 6aid they wanted.
Supervisor Tobin apologized and declared
that he had been misrepresented in the
newspapers, on the streets and else
where, and did not care; He did not
want public office, but' couia not be in
sulted while. Occupying a* public position.
Mr. Tobin shows that he has moods other
than that generally known as Jocose.
The gambling interests were then given
an opportunity. Prince Poniatowski took
the floor and declared that, he had found
himself possessed of an equal ability lo
raise horses and children. He made no
pretense of disguising the nflrpose of his
presence 'and the object or his friends.
He declared that he would not pretend t->
say that racing wag moral, but that he
wanted the right to conduct it in this city
fgr thirty days. He declared that in th'a
endeavor of his there are associated wlOi
him Robert Oxnard and A. B. Spreckela
and seventeen others, but he forgot proo
ably to add that among these associate*
are Johnny Farley, saloon-keeper; Joe
Harvey, gambler, and Charles L. Fair.
Prince Poniatowski expressed great bit-
terness against The Call for its antag
onism to the reopening of Ingleside.
In saying this he expressed regret and
surprise that the proprietor of The Call
had left the room. As ho paid so some
surprise, was also expressed in the audi
ence, who knew" that the proprietor of
The Call would have asked Prince Ponla
towski if his experience on the racetracks
of France qualified him particularly to
manage a reputable racetrack in San
Francisco.
When Prince. Ponintowflki concluded
Supervisor Tobin moved the Indorsement
of the resolutions adopted bf the Super
visors. These resolutions memorialize
the Legislature to give to every county in
,the State the privilege of holding thirty
days' racing In every year, but prohibiting
every county rrom allowing any book
making or poolsfclling for a longer period
than thirty days. This memorial also
gives to every county the right to prohibit
. bookmaking and poolselllng altogether.
Supervisor Tobin had no sooner present
ed his resolution than Rev. John A. B.
Wilson was on his feet with a substitute.
This substitute was the excerpt from the
Mayor's message, which has already been
mentioned and. in which the Mayor de
nounces gambling as a great evil. Mayor
Phelon flushed crimson and hesitatingly
declared the substitute out of order. To
bln'3 motion was adopted by a vote of 44
to 19, and immediately afterward Dr. Wil
son's resolution .was also adopted. Both,
therefore, one stultifying the other, the
first showing the Mayor's efforts to aid
his gambling friends and the second ex
posing his sham*, will go before the Leg
islature from this city.
HOW CITIZENS
PLEADED FOR
CITY DECENCY
Complete Report or the Incl
..-..dents of ; a Remarkable"
Meeting Called -mj the
â¢ Mauor Last Night,
.-.Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦-.
: Those parts of the meeting which are of
vital Importance are plven in full in what
follows: .'_-Â¦' . .-
Mayor Phelan Explains.
The Mayor called the meeting to order an.1
cuted the object in calling it. saying: "Dur
ing the week a discussion of the question of
regulating racing and the selling of pools came
before the Board of Supervisors unexpectedly
and as there was a general misunderstanding
among the citizens as to the best methods 'of
procedure with a view to suppressing or regu
lating racing and poolselllng and gambling" I
thought it well to call a conference here this
evening of citizen's, that we might exchange
views and at the same time that more exact
Information might be communicated to the
gentlemen here than they could 'gain through
the columns of the press as to the condition
cf the law and as to the respective powers of
the Board of Supervisors and. the Legislature.
There seems .to be. a -general ooncurrence
among the clergy ofMhe city in the view
that racing and bookmaking and poolselllng
should be suppressed. So far as San Fran
cisco is concerned, by ordinance of the Board
of Supervisors, there is now no poolselllng
within the limits of the city and county. Rac
ing is not forbidden, but -pooUelllng is forbid
den, whether In the lnclosure of . a racetrack
or without. And those who conduct races con
tend, that they cannot profitably, . or at all,
carry on the racing season without the privi
lege of selling pools, or making bets, at any
rate within the lnclosure of the track. The
men who conduct the racing are, they claim,
not interested In poolsellinjr outside of the
track. In the .city of San Francisco, by ordi
nance, there is no poolselllng allowed. Â¦
The Mayor then went into what he styled a
history of the various racetracks in and' about
the city, and a statement of the situation, as
ho .claimed it to be. which he urged made- the
pending proposition for a limited racing- sea
son advisable, stating that the track at Em
eryville, owing to its location, was beyond lo
cal control and could only be regulated by the
action of the .Legislature. He then continued:
.Why 'He Called tho Meeting-.
"As the question was .â¢alscd. and as t,he citi
zens, and especially the clergymen. â¢ Eeremed
to be Interested in the matter, I thought it
only proper to bring them here 'and tell them
that the remedy was In the Legislature. . and
whatever force was accumulating now for bet
ter morals In San. Francisco should, be. direct
ed, not to tha Board of Supervisors, at, this
time at any rate, . but to, tho- Legislature, and
if we all stood together we . could : probably
Have them enact the New. York law, which al-
Iowb racing for . thirty or r f drty days' In the
State and absolutely forbids the sale of pools.
"We have nothing to conceal. I If you petition
the Legislature here in mass meeting , to pass
such an act I am sure that- you will-be- heard
at- least respectfully by 'Â¦ that ' hody, and per
haps an Impression can : be made -. upon â¢ them.
But so far as I and the Board . of Supervisors
IF the meeting called by !toycr
Pholan last night had any meunlni
it mean* that the enlightened pub
lie opinion of this city, expressed ljy
men who?? rtanding Js ab.*olutely
unquestioned. Is Irrevocably op
posed to a resumption of rsfcetraek
gambling in San Fran-cisco. The
men who make our Jocal laws could
not esrspe tho deduction of whit
was paid last night aitd know that
any measure which will restore the evil
of gambling In this city, under any pre
tense, will he in opposition to the decent
and Intelligent public opinion of the city.
More than that the enlightened public
opinion of this city is heartily in accord
with any effort which may be made to
suppress Rambling in every other city !n
the State, but not at the expense of what
has already been won in San Francisco.
Mayor Phelan cannot escape from the jus
tice of the accusation that he acted la: t
night with deliberate unfairness to the !
decent people whom he invited to his
meeting. In his call for that meeting: he
declared that the racing season should
be limited by the Legislature and that
pool-pelling and bookmaking be prohibit
ed, and yet with his sanction, with every
evidence of preconceived suggestion, t-e
secured' from his followers last night the
adoption of a resolution which not only
permits but indorses bookmaking and
pool*selling in every racetrack which may
be established in every county in the
State.
The men whom he classed as jepresen
tatlve? of enlightened puollc opinion be
lieved what he said in his call and were
astounded when they discovered that he
did not mean what he said, but meant
what h%s satellite. Supervisor Tobin, is
advocatingâ another thirty-day-a-year
reign of bookmaking thievery In any
county which Is foolhardy enough to in
dulge it. Disgusted at this change of po
sition on the part of the Mayor the decent
men whom he had Invited refused to ac
cept his substitute and then forced him to
adopt his own words condemning track
gambling as an evil which should be sup
pressed.
It was almost ?:30 o'clock when Mayor
Phelan called the assembly together. He
declared that he admitted the point of
view of clergymen and citizens In general
against racehorse gambling. He declared
that while 8an Francisco was free from
the evil its citizens had an opportunity to
patronize racetracks In our vicinity and
the- remedy is alone in the hands of the
Legislature and not the Supervisors. And
he said: "I and the Supervisors will be
silent until the Legislature adjourns."
He then outlined what he claimed to be
a history of the racetracks in- and near
San Francisco. W.nen he had concluded
he asked for an expression "f opinion:
There was silence and he declared that
he saw Prince Poniatowski and Mr.
Crocker, Charles L. Fair and other racing
men present and he would like, to get
their point of view. He said that the
racing men told him that there had to be
eome gambling or trey could not keep up
the game, but that it could be conducted
honorably and bad men thrown out. He
then called upon the Rev. Dr. William
Rader. pastor of the Third Congregational
Church, to address the mass-meeting.
Must Fight Annually.
Dr. Raoer did fo. and left absolutely
no doubt of the position of the enlightened
element of San Francisco which he rep
resents. He declared that every year the
decent people of San Francisco must fight
against the aggrr-nsions of gamblers and
their shameful methods, and while he
would like to see a State law of regula
tion enacted he did not wish to see that
enactment jeopardize anything of what
this city nan won in decency. He urged
that rather than memorialize the Legis
lature for thirty days of racing and gam
bling we should present our own prohibi
tory ordinance and ask the Legislature to
make it a statute of the State. He de
clared that California Is being disgraced
by the advent of Eastern adventurers and
gamtilers. and that for the good name of
car State we should not legalize that
gambling in every county, but place upon
gambling an absolute prohibition and shut
the Eastern parasites out. Upon one
thing, he said. Mayor Phelan, the Super
visors and every honest, decent citizen
of San Francisco will agreeâ that never
again trill Ingleside be reopened In San
Francisco as a gambling resort.
Rabbi Nieto was then called upon by
Mayor Phelan, and spoke at some length.
The reverend gentleman declared that
under no circumstance would he give his
moral support to any measure which will
place upon the statute books of Califor
nia a recognition of gambling in this
State. He declared that the Legislature
could not so far degrade itself as to" do
that. At the same time he Is In favor of
racing, and believes that communities
f hould be large enough and brave enough,
if an evil develops out of racing, to recog
nize that evil, regulate it and curb it.
John IX Spreckels then arose to explain
the attitude of The Call in this grave
matter. He declared that the only pur
pose of this paper in its agitation against
horseracing as now conducted is to de
stroy. If possible, gambling In this city
and that the policy pursued by The Call
has been dictated absolutely by him and
under* his Instruction alone. In answer
to a question from Supervisor Tobin, Mr.
rt HE mass-meeting called by Mayor Phelan to elicit an enlightened public opinion on the question
of racing, bovkmaking and pool-selling in this city zvas held last night, and Mayor Phelan and
the Supervisors knozv nozv that the enlightened public opinion of San Francisco is emphatically,.
intelligently and untiringly opposed to horse-racing which is attended with any form of gambling in
San Francisco. . Â¦
Never perhaps before in the history of the city has so unanimous a protest been made against an
nil by the best elements of the city as zvas made last night, when men voiced the bitterest denunciation
against any effort which will restore the gamblers to San Francisco. The men who voiced this opinion
declared that they are not adverse but rather in complete sympathy zvith the Mayor's ozun avozved pro
posal that bookmaking and pool-selling be abolished on every racetrack in the State. This in outline teas
the meaning of the meeting last night.
Mayor Phclan, fearful of what might happen, took care to invite horsemen, stablemen and busi
ness men, who make profit of racetrack gamblers, to the meeting, and at the pleading of Supervisor
Tobin these men, forty-four in number, out of the population of San Francisco, voted to memorialize the
Legislature to permit racing and bookmaking for thirty days in each county, zvith the deeply significant
proviso that any county shall alzvays have the right to abolish both racing and bookmaking and pool-selling
within county limits. And fast upon the adoption of this resolution anotha\was indorsed for transmis
sion to the present Legislature. -
77ii.r document is an excerpt from the Mayor's message delivered, on January 8, 1900, to t the
Board of Supcrz'isors, in which Mayor Phclan declares that public gambling is a great evil, leading to
poverty, disgrace, defalcation and death, which the records of the city abundantly prove, and its prac
tice should be discountenanced and suppressed. This resolution, also showing beyond peradventure of a
doubt that tJw people of San Francisco will not tolerate Ingleside and its gambling, will be sent zvith thc %
other to the Legislature.
The only meaning of the meeting last night zvas that San Francisco has had' its share of the
shame which follows track gambling, and that Mayor Phclan, supported By City Hall employes, Super
visorial satellites, confessedly racetrack fiends and men zvho earn their living by the bounty of track
gamblers, insist that gambling, admittedly a crime in every other State' in the Union, shall receive in
dorsement upon the statute books of California. â¢ .

" â¢ "We are here to oppose racing In any form and any where. Our services were held Sunday night
not in the interests of any one track, but against the evils of horseracing in, the entire State aB well as in
the city and county of San Yrancisco. We believe that if the Supervisors and the Mayor will maintain

Many such people pride themselves** 'on
their acuteness .In never being hum-

This fear 'of being humbugged can be
carried too far. so far. in fact, that many

Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different In one important respect
from ordinary patent medicines -for the
reason that they are not a secret patent
medicine; no secret Is made of the Ingred-
ients, but analysis shows them to conta>n
the natural digestive 1 ferments, pure-
aseptic pepsin (government teat) Golden
Seal and diastase. They are not cathartic,
neither do they act powerfully on any
particular organ, but they euro indiges-

Ins the food eaten thoroughly before It
has time to ferment, sour and cause the
mischief. This Is the only secret of their
success.
Cathartic pttls never have and never
can cure Indigestion and stomach troubles,
because they act only on the bowels,
whereas the whole- trouble is fh thÂ»
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all there Is

Is poison, as it creates gas. acidity, head-
aches, palpitation of the heart, loss of

OF NEWGAED'S DEATH
Â¦ The Police Commissioners met last night
to discuss the practicability of so dividing
up the watches of the patrolmen that they
would only have to serve eight hours out
of twenty-four, but nothing, definite >a a
determined upon as-iiie present force is
too small to make the change. Chief Sul
livan presented a report showing that be
fore it would be possible' to make the de
sired change it would l>e necessary to in
crease the department ' by the appoint
ment of 160 new members. To establish
a system of eight-hour watches It would
be necessary to have 103 more men in the
northern district, thirty-nve more in Uio
southern district and twenty-two more
in the -Mission district. .Under the char
ter the city is entitled to 179 more polico
men, but the funds to pay them are not at
hand. <
'A lengthy opinion written by District
Attorney Bylngton, quoting legal author
ities," showed that J the power to increase
the force rests in the hands of the
Supervisors. ! .
-After "a lengthy discussion it was de
cided to ask the Supervisors to raaTte pro
vision 5 for the appointment , of twenty
five more policemen, in- Â©rder. that the out

He then called up the resolution of Dr. Wil
son, which was also adopted, upon which the
meeting adjourned.
The Mayor then put the question upon the
adoption of Mr. Tobin's resolution and upon a
rising vote declared It carried iby . a vote ! of
41 agalnet 19. ...
, Rev. Dr. Rader said he approved of these re
marks, and Rev. ; Dr. Bell said he could not
conscientiously approve of thelast paragraph
of the resolution adopted by the biard.
The Rev. Dr. NIeto In explanation of his
vote said: "I want to put myself in my proper
place In this matter. I do not consider It rlsht
p.r.d proper for the Legislature to enact any
IftWiand put it upon the statute book In which
It gives its tacit consent to wholesale gam
bling. I cannot vote for the resolution as it
now stands."
The meeting recognized in' this substitute the
words of the Mayor, taken bodily from his last
annual message, and laushed and applauded at
the predicament In which the quotation placed
him. The Mayor himself Joined In the laugh
and ruled that the resolution was not properly
a substitute, but might he voted upon after
ward.
At the end of the discussion between Â¦ th-j
Mayor and Erinre Ponlatowskl. Rev. Dr. Wil
son offered the following as a substitute for
Mr. Tobln's motion: "Public rambllnsr Is a
great evil, leading to ooverty, disgrace, defal
cation and death, which the records of the city
abundantly prove, and Its practice should bo
discountenanced end suriprepsed."
. Prince Ponlatowsklâ Yes, sir; I think It per
fectly fair.: Our Idea is if we can reduce rac
ing to December, January and February it
would be for the best Interest of the sport. I
c"n not speak of San Francisco, but of all rac
ing in the State. â¢ There Is one bad feature
about the Horton law of New York â It is sim
ply playlne into the hands of the bookmaker?.
The Mayor â The advantage then to you of
the Legislature passing the act would be to
make a uniform limit to racing in the several
counties? , , â¢ , ,.-.. Â¦
Prince Ponlatowsklâ Certainly. The same
class ' of people : eo to one place ' as go to the
otUer. Of this number about twelve hundred
are net from S?an Francisco; they are Eastern
men and floating population.' They come from
New Orleans, New York, Chicago and else
where.
Prince Ponlatowyki â Fully ninety-nine ani
four-fifths per cent are from San Francisco.
We had thirty-three local people at the last
race from San Mateo and twenty-eight hun
dred fr6m S3n Francisco. ...
The Mayorâ And the came people would at
tend the races at Inerleslde? ,
The Mayor-â Are the r>Â«ople who attend Tan
foran Park from San Francisco or elsewhere?
It and keep it in the hands of that element
by limiting the season to a reasonable num
ber of days. Wo are at your disposal, look
ing at this matter Indifferent to a certain ex
tent what course' you take. As between In-
Eleside and Tanforan, they are absolutely In
different to us. One Is thirty-four minutes
travel from the city In one direction
and the other Is thirty-three minutes
in another direction. " As ""to " " raclne, [
do not pretend that . it is a moral
thing, but the world Is as we find It. In
England and In France the Bport is In the
hands of a 'high "class of men. we wish to
have the same condition of affairs here."
The Mayor â Your company now conducts
Tanforan Park T* â¢ :'* 'Â¦ : "
Prince -Ponlatowsklâ Yes, sir; Tanforan
Park. 'Â¦/' jT* , '- ' .. ,i
The May"br-^-And" the "races there' are per
fectly fair? -. , â¢â¢ ,... , .
Prince Poniatowski â There is no question
about that at all. It never has been raised..
CHARGES HUSBAND
WITH KIDNAPING
Mrs. Alice Lance Recovers
Child That Is Taken
Prom Her.
Little One Is Found Safe at 1780
Eddy Street and . the Accused
Father. Is Ndt Ar-
At the request of Mrs. Alice Lance'
Judge Cabaniss Issued a warrant late
yesterday afternoon for the arrest of
Richard C. Lance, husband of the com
plainant, on a charge of kidnaping hi3
own child. The Lances arrived here a
few days ago from Mexico and took quar
ters at a lodging-house on Third street,
near Stevenson. â¢
In applying for the warrant Mrs. Lance,
who was accompanied by her attorney,
related a simple story to the Judge. She
stated that she left her rooms for a mo
ment yesterday afu-inoon and when she
returned she found the place deserted and
her husband and flve-months-old child
gone. . . "^-_.-
The warrant was issued and Captain
Seymour detailed Detective Whlttaker to
arrest Lance. Mrs. Lance told the de
tective that her husLand would probably
attempt to leave for Mexico and asked
him to watch for her spouse at the ferry.
She seemed anxious 10 have the matter
given as little publicity as possible and
would vouchsafe no reason for her hus
band's desire to leave her.
â¢ Lance did not put in an appearance at
the ferry and after Â¦ waiting awhile the
woman returned to r her attorney's office.
While there she received a telephone call
that her child was safe at a house at 1760
Eddy street.
Detective Whlttaker went to the place
and after satisfying Himself that Mrs.
Lance was In possession of her infant re
ported back to his captain and dropped
the case. Â¦ '. :
It was learned that Mrs. Lance's hus
band Is a man of some means.. Of late
the couple have quarreled frequently.
From a word let drop here and there in
telling her troubles to the policemen it
appears that Mrs. Lance's woes are of a
family nature. Spanish blood runs freely
In her ve,lns and jealousy Is no small part
of her make-up. Lance is an Englishman
and of- easy-going- disposition. Mrs. Lance
has a. sister, as ' beautiful 'as herself and
very attractive.. So much so, if the wife's
story is not merely Imaginative or caused
by the green-eyed trouble maker, that she
won the admiration of her brother-in-law.
Whether Mrs.. Lance will Insist on the
arrest of her husband Is a matter of con
jecture. She was not at home last night
to visitors.

skillful performers to play lively tunes during the

OPPOSING THE EXCHANGE OF SILVER
Ab we loretold. tne advocates 01 tne tree coinage
of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 are out in oppo
sition to the proposed law making gold and
silver interchangeable.
General Warner of Ohio, presidect of the Bi
metallic League, one rf the organizations which
nominated Bryan, leads in the discussion from that
tide of the question. He asks: "Why first coin sil
ver, then store it in the treasury, issue certificates on
ir, and then make the silver, and virtually the certifi
cate, redeemable in gold? Is that a common sense
system of money? Would it not be more rational, if
silver or silver certificates are to be made redeemable
'n pold, to change the form of the certificates, make
them directly redeemable in gold and sell the silver
and put the proceeds^n the treasury'?"
To this it may be ar.swercd that the proposed law
deals with a condition and not a theory- General
Warner and his coworkers for free silver have added
to the circulation $490,104,027 in standard silver dolp
lars. The average actual value of a silver dollar for
the year 1900 was 46.419 cents. The average commer
cial ratio of gold to silver for the year was I to 34;
the legal ratio of I te 16.
The actual value of General Warner's $490,104,027
in silver dolkrs was just $227,501,383. That is the
price that this mass of etiined silver would bring, if
sold in the market, as he suggests.
The last report of the Secretary of the Treasury
docs not give the cost of this silver to the Govern
ment. But as it was bought and coined under the
Bland and Sherman acts, at a higher price than
its present value per oAince, the Government would
lose heavily by selling at the present price of 60 cents
an ounce.
In this condition what is to be done to keep the
Government's promise that gold and silver shall be
maintained at a parity at the legal ratio? The con
dition was created at the instance -of General Warner
and his friends. The only way to safely meet it and
maintain his $227,501,388 in silver at its coinage par
ity with $490,104,027 in gold is, not by "redeeming"
silver in gold, as he erroneously puts it, but by mak
ing the coins of the two metals interchangeable. By
this interchange, if he prefer his own phrase, gold will
be "redeemed" in silver or silver will be "redeemed"
in gold at a parity.
He is in error in saying that no other nation ever
attempted such a policy, for it closely approximates
the system adopted by France in 1876, after a hundred
years' fruitless experiment with an artificial ratio and
attempt to maintain the fiction of the double stan
dard.
If we had not snubbed the financial experience of
the world, including the fresh example of France, we
would not have begun in 1878, under the Bland acr,
the accumulation of this stock of silver. But we did
it, *and its presence in the body of our currency, a
merely mechanical increment, must be made as little
noxious as possible. To'do this and avoid further
accumulation beyond the absorptive power of th:
country, it must be made interchangeable with gold.
For reasons already explained, the silver certificates
will not become a menace to the gold reserve, be
cause, being" in small denominations, they will neither
be used in paying duties and excises nor hoarded by
the banks for a raid on gold, as the banks cannot se
cure control of them except by paying a premium.
After this legislation passes the stream of gold will
continue to flow into and out of the treasury, a true
river of Pactolus, upon which our commerce wsil
fiont. It will continue to flow hitherward from all the
world, making us a great reservoir of the world's
capital and therefore the world's creditor.
SALISBURY'S HOME PROGRAMME
WHETHER Salisbury will continue to hold the
post of Prime Minister after the assembling of
the first Parliament to be called by the King
is a question that is agitating a good many political
brains in the United Kingdom. There have been
stories that the King is unfriendly to him, but they
hrve met with a prompt denial. There are other re
ports that his followers are disposed to break away
from him on account of objections to his appoint
ment of so many of his own family to Cabinet posi
tions, but the reports have not been confirmed by the
appearance of any Conservative of note among the
objectors. Consequently all speculations concerning 1
the future of the Premiership are but guesses, none
of which are worthy of much credence.
While the political experts are prophesying his fall
the aged Premier is evidently doing his best to estab
lish his leadership upon a firmer basis and strengthen
his hold upon the people. The war in South Africa
is no longer popujar, and so Salisbury, with the tact of
an accomplished politician, offers to the country a
new issue. In a recent address at a Conservative ban
quet he urged upon the party the adoption of a
programme of social teform. The London Spectator
in giving an account of his speech said: "His chief
point was to insist that if Jhe Conservatives were to
keep their hold on London they must take up" tht
1-ousing question. 'They should devote all the power
they possess to getting rid of that which is really a
scandal to our civilization â the sufferings which many
of the working classes have to undergo in, the most
moderate, I might say, the most pitiable, accommo
dation.' They must not be frightened away from the
remedies for social evils by the fact that they are made
a cover or pretense for attacks upon property and
other institutions. 'You must repel these attacks, but
at the same time you must not allow your attention to
be diverted from the stern necessities which the vast
social changes of our time are imposing upon all who
cherish the prosperity of this country.' "
Such a programme is calculated to add to the
Conservative following in those parts of great cities
where the radicals and socialists have been strongest.
It will be, however, something like a new departure
for British Toryism. It is true the improvement of
slums has been carried out to a considerable extent in
all British cities, whether under Tory or Liberal con
trol, but such improvements were regarded as strictly
matters of local politics. It will be a different matter
altogether for the imperial Parliament to undertakes
social reform in the cities at the expense of the tax
payers of the whole kingdom.
From all indications it appears^the proposed pro
gramme will be acceptable to the public The Spec
tator in commenting upon it says: "It is "a vital
problem. Unhappily, there are at this moment thou
sands of children growing up in London and the
great towns under, conditions which *do not allow
them to become good citizens,* morally and physically.
Unless that state of things is stopped, and we cease
to produce a slum population, the state is in danger
01" an invasion -of the worst possible kindâ the inva
sion of an unfit and demoralized population, not from
cutside, but from within. No doubt the destruction
of slums is costly, but remember that the essential
thing for getting rid of slums is not money, but care

of one who died are admitted In a trial
for murder only as ,to those t nines to
which the party who made the declaration
could have been competent jto testify to
if sworn as a witness In the cause. Thev
would refer to facts only and not t o mei-i
opinions or matter of opinions^ There i^
no decision in California " that says that

A BETâ TV K.. City. If a man bets that
a certain. candidate would be elected and
the official announcement of the result
showed that that candidate was defeated,
there being no special agreement as to the
declaring: of the result, the party who
bet on the defeated candidate would have
to pay. If on a recount it should turn
out that the defeated candi
date was really elected but had been
counted out. whether the money would be
returned would depend upon the honor of
the man who took the money. The part/
who paid the money in the first instance
could not recover at law, as betting on an
election is contrary to law and against
public policy.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
It is stated that the main objection of litigants to
jury trials is the frequency with which juries dis
agree, thus causing delay and increasing the cost of
suits. Furthermore, there is noted among the Eng
lish a growing confidence in their. Judges, and /an
increasing willingness to accept their decisions upon
matters of fact as well as of law. As trial without a
jury facilitates the dispatch of the business t of the
court and on the whole gives as much if not greater
satisfaction to litigants, the old system is falling into
disuse. The figures quoted show to what extent the
tendency has already gone, and are certainly interest
ing as an illustration of the change in English senti
ment toward a system which was once regarded, and
rightly so, as the surest guarantee of the rights and
the property of a citizen. .
The Westminster Gazette in discussing a review of
the subject in a recent issue of the London Law
Journal sums up the progress made in getting rid oi
jury trials by saying: "The proportion of actions to
be tried without juries in the Queen's Bench Division
during the present term is exceptionally large; the
jury cases number 295, and the non-jury cases 190.
Even more striking is the want of faith in trial b>
jury displayed by litigants in the county courts. The
total number of actions determined by these tribunals
in 1899 was 732,094, and o*nly 1018 were tried with
juries. The number of actions tried with juries in
1899 was, with the exception of 1897, the smallest for
sixteen years."
WHILE the American people have frequently
expressed discontent with the Grand Jury sys
tem and at times have started movements to
abolish it, there has hardly ever been any objection to
the system of trial juries. Even when, as has some
times happened, the verdict of, a jury has seemed to
be the result of ignorance, or worse, public con
demnation has been pronounced upon the members
of that particular jury rather than upon the system
itself. Consequently it will come to most Americans
as something of a surprise that in England, the home
of trial by jury, the system is becoming more. and
more unpopular, and :s to a\Considcrable extent dying
out.
JURY TRIALS IN ENGLAND.
These are the absolute facts. That the
young man Is the son of the Prince Im
perial there is little doubt. But it Is hard
to explain how he could be legally recog
nized, although he may inherit the im
mense fortune of his grandmother, who
despises Prince Victor, the Bonapartist
pretender.
Last year William Watkins was gradu
ated in letters and sciences. He visits
the Empress at Chiselhurst. She used to
pee him -in Paris twice a year on her way
to the Riviera. .:;â¢-"Â¦>
Herisson, a Bonapartist, took charge of
the child, William Watkins, who was
reared at Issy (outside of Paris) by the
Christian Brothers, and not at Saint Sul
pice. in Paris. Saint Sujplce Is a sem
inary for priests.
The Empress took charge of the child
on condition that the mother would go to
Australia. This was complied with, and
since then Charlotte has not been heard
of. She resided for some time in Sydney.
If she was married again to a man named
Moore there Is no available record of it.
The child was born in legal wedlock â
that is, when the legal husband of Char
lotte "VVatkins was yet alive.
Charlotte TVatkins suspected for the
first time that her lover was some one of
importance when she saw him shaking
hands with the Duke of York, but she
only discovered his true identity after his
death, when she saw his picture In the
magazines.
She was a teacher at a roller skating
rink in London, where she met the Prince,
who did not tell her who he was. Her
father was a forester. She used to call
upon the Prince at Woolwich, where he
was a cadet. v VÂ» -"-*?Â¦
The Prince Imperial never married
Charlotte Watkins, for the simple reason
that she had a husband, who was then
dying of consumption at the Brompton
street Hospital.
According to Karl Melite, who made the
first thorough investigation and who has
since kept informed on the subject, the
whole story can be told in a few words:
The British correspondents are now de
voting a grind deal of space to the child
of the Prince Imperial, who was killed in
Zululand while serving in the regiment
commanded by Lord Kitchener, then a
colonel. The first intimation that the
Prince Imperial left a child was published
in the Cincinnati Enquirer five years ago,
under the heading, "Xapoleon V." The
article was in the shape of correspond
ence by Karl Melite from Paris. The
Galignani Messenger, an English paper
published in Paris, had already hinted
that it had on hand a few interesting let
ters sent by the Prince to a married
woman. JCo child was mentioned. These
letters were bought by Rouher, former
Prime Minister of Napo*leon III and ad
viser of ex-Empress Eugenie. Since then
little has been made public on the sub
ject, but the English correspondents have
succeeded in distorting the facts. -
RECOGNIZED HEIR OF NAPOLEON IV.
WHEN Dubois was. elected to the Senatorship
from Idaho the so-called Silver Republicans be
lieved they had obtained a representative in the
United States Senate, and a" similar faith was held by
the 'Populists when Patterson was elected from Colo
! rado. It appears, however, that in each case the be
lief is ill-founded and the faith but a fond delusion.
Dubois had played the silver game and Patterson the
Populist game only for the purpose of getting votes.
As soon as elected each straightway announced him
self a Democrat.
Of the exact language used by Dubois in declaring
himself a straight Democrat we have not noticed any
reports, but Patterson's language is thus quoted in
the Omaha Bee: "The principles of the Kansas City
platform are those, in the main, for which the Peo
ple's and Silver Republican' parties have contender.
I believe a fight for them can be most successfully
made within the Democratic ranks., Those who are
outside of them are cutside of the fortifications and
are but helpless lookers-on. I can see no present hope
for the triumph of the principles of the Kansas City
platform except through the Democratic party."
Such declarations put an end to the old fusion trick
which carried so many Populist and Republican votes
tc Bryan. The men who were deceived into voting
with the Democrats by the promise that they were
to have recognition can now perceive that they have
been given gold bricks. Patterson and Dubois had
but a thin veneering of Populism and silverism when
they solicited votes for the Senate, and now even that
is gone.
One other silverite of note who has virtually passed
over to the Bryanites is Towne of Minnesota. That
gentleman has had a singular political fortune. Nomi
nated for Vice President by the Populists, he with
drew in favor of the Democratic candidate, Steven
son. Nevertheless, in a manner,. he has reached the
Vice Presidenc}'. Appointed by tihe Governor of
Minnesota to fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Senator Davis, he had a seat in that body for a month,
and while there was by courtesy, of the Senate once
called to the chair and so acted for a time as Vice
President. He took his honor blithely and pertly.
and in reply to a humorous congratulation from Sen
ator Mason said: "I zm now satisfied.' One term as
a member of the House of Representatives, one
month as United States Senator, and one hour as act
ing Vice President."
Doubtless Dubois and Patterson are even better
satisfied than Towne; but how is it with the Populist-j
who trusted the one and with those sincere Repub
licans who in their zeal for silver supported the other?

This association represents exclusively the cattle
industry and will watch and tend that interest with a
view to its permanency and to the economizing of the
production of beef. The cattle interest desires the
present forest reserves to remain intact, and that others
be made in order that the water sources may be pro
tected. It desires the application of irrigation in the
arid region wherever waste water may be stored for
that purpose, and its policy is to promote the settle
ment of the West and a peaceful union of all the forces
that make for the upbuilding of the country'- It is a
matter of pride in this State that this powerful na
tional organization sprang from the loins of the
Pacific Stockmen's Association, which was formed :n
this city, and among the coming great conventions
which may meet here will probably be the annual
gathering of these herdsmen of the plains and moun
tains.
This may be a' hard world, but among its expe
riences is the conclusion that hard words butter no
parsnips, and the whole livestock interest probably
owes its defeat on the Grout bill to the overdona
swagger of the gentle shepherds.
The consumers of animal products of all kinds will
be glad to turn with confidence to the American
Cattle-growers' Association, which, admonished by
the aggressions of the sheep and wool interest, the
cattle men formed at Salt Lake, and which will hold
its first convention at Denver in March.
Since the manufacture of this butter substitute
reached great proportions the value of the oleo oils
in each steer, sheep and hog is added to the market
value, of the meat and by-products of those animals.
It is said to add $2.50 to the price of every steer. This
has aided in disposing of the glut of beef suet and
tallow. 'Â¦
The contention over the bill has been bitter be
tween the dairy and livestock interests, and has been
participated in to a degree by the consumers, respec
tively, of butter and oleomargarine. The favorable re
port on the bill by the Senate conimittee was probably
precipitated by the exceeding aggressiveness of the
sheep interests in the recent National Livestock Con
vention at Salt Lake City. The convention resolved
against the Grout bill, but the sheep interest avenged
itself upon the Secretary of Agriculture for his
declaration in favor of leasing the arid ranges by a
.esolution attacking him immoderately. This, to
gether with the sheep men's opposition to forest re
serves, their demand that such districts as the Black
Mesa in Arizona be omitted from such reserves, and
that the reservations already made be opened to sheep,
produced a reaction at Washington that wise men
should have expected.
margarine, it more nearly resembles butter to the eye
than if uncolored. The Grout bill is directed against
this coloring and puts a tax of ten cents a pound on
all colored oleomargarine. This is held to be a pro
hibitive tax and to be a misuse of the taxing power.
It seems, however, that the manufacturers color it
with the same substances that arc used in coloring
dairy butter, so that, although it is stamped as oleo-
THE bill to regulate the sale of oleomargarine,
known as the Grout bill, which has passed the
House, is favorably reported by the Senate
committee. The present law requires oleomargarine
to be stamped and sold as such, under the supervision
cf the Internal Revenue Department. This substitute
for butter, which is made of the oleo oils in the fat
of cattle, sheep and swine, is not inedible, since the
fats of which it is composed are all edible and an;
used as a food component in their original state. If
people desire to buy and eat it as a cheap and not un
wholesome substitute for butter, there should be no
objection to their doing. so, provided it is sold for
what it is, as the law requires.
THE GROUT BILL.
The learned Frenchman hopes to check
the alarming progress of the United
States in industry, an.j enterprise by a
"combine" of continental powers through
agreement upon long-term commercial
treaties, subject to revision from time tt>
time by a permanent European customs
commission. The mere fact that a man of
such note as M. Lerov-Beaulleu should
seriously advocate such a complicated
concerted scheme among powers, who find
it much easier to disagree than to^agrea
upon anv line of policy, bears evidence
that Yankeephobia prevails to a large ex
tent on the continent, even In this his
toric season of "peaco and goodwill."â.

This country is en the point of becoming by
far the most Important economic factor la the

Moreover, it will very soon have a considerable
mercantile marine.
Some of the newspapers are saying that
by the elevation of Albert Edward to the
throne his son George, Duke of York,
now becomes thÂ© Prince of Wales, but
this is not so. The only hereditary title
that passes to the Duke of York at thl3
time Is that of Duke of Cornwall. He
will not be Prince of Wales until that
title is conferred upon him by a new
creation. When Edward I conquered
Wales he conferred the title of that prin
cipality- upon his eldest son, who after
ward became Edward II. Edward III
granted the title to his eldest son. Edward
the Black Prince, and the grant was. a? it
has ever since been, "to him and his
heirs, the kings of England." ThÂ© title
does not descend. Hence when a Prince
of Wales and Duke of Cornwall succeeds
to the throne the principality of Wales
merges at once in the crown, and can
have n<5t separate existence until a fresh
creation is made, but the dukedom de
scends to his son. Undoubtedly the new
King of England will confer the title of
Prince of Wales upon hl3 son. but until ha
does so there will be no Prince of Wales

One of the remarkable phases of tha

Not an altogether vain hope so far as
the State courts can aid in turning the
tide, but vain indeed with respect to the
United States Supreme Court itself.
For ere long it reversed Itself, attacking 1
its own rule. Thin was done In the case of
Baugh against the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad. A fireman was injured through
the negligence of the engineer, both of
whom were managing an engine attached
to a freight train. A rule of the company
provided that "whenever a train or engine
is run without a conductor the engineman
thereof will also be regarded as conductor
and will act accordingly." So the question
under the operation of this rule was pre
cisely like the question in Ross' case. Yet
the court decided that both were fellow
servants and consequently the company
was not liable. The reasons for this re
versal, which were stated by Justice
Brewer, may be given. "Prlma facie." he Â¦
! begins â In other words, unless there iÂ«
some proof to the contraryâ "all who en
ter into the employ of a single master are
engaged in a common service and are fel
low-servants, and some other line c* de
marcation than that of control must exist
to destroy the relation of fellow-servants.
All enter the service of the same master
to further his interests In the one enter
prise; each knows when entering into that
service that there is some risk of injury
through the negligence of other employes,
and that risk, which he knows exists he
assumed in entering into the employ
ment." Â¦ ,
Mr. Justice Field was still a member of
the court and dissented most vigorously
from the majority, supported by the Chief
Justice. Last year the finish was made of
the Ross case. Mr. Justice Shiras wrote
the opinion of the court and reviewed at
great length the decisions rendered by the
State courts, showing clearly enough that
the rule in many of them was In haromny
with the new rule established by the Fed
eral court. Thus the attempt made by
the Supreme Court in the Ross case to
convert a railway conductor into a ser
vant or agent of his employer has entire
ly failed, and he still ranks as a fellow
employe along with the brakemen and
other trainmen. Furthermore, It will bo
seen from the extract quoted from Mr.
Justice Brewer's opinion that all the ser
vants of a company generally are to bo
regarded as fellow-servants and thus the
doctrine announced in the case of Priest
ly and Farwell. described in the first of
this series of papers, has at last been
stretched to Include almost all servants
working under a common employer and
relieving a company or employer from all
liability to respond for their negligence,
on the ground that the employes, whether
few or many, assumed the risk. Pos
sibly the Supreme Court might hold, in
the case of a railroad company, that the
president, vice president and superintend
ent and a few other officers are Its agents
and not fellow-servants of the thousands
working under their immediate or remote
direction; but who are Its agents and who
are not? The last case, that of Conroy.
leaves all In thedark. It smites down every
rule that the courts have tried to draw
between agents and non-agents employed
by a company; it shows that they are all
based on a sandy foundation and ought
not to stand. What. then. Is left of this
doctrine of fellow-service? We cannot
see anything in <he way of a Federal rule.
It is true that a few of the leading of
ficers may still be regarded as agents,
for whose acts their company may be
liable, but the court does not take the
trouble to define them. Perhaps it was
not worth while, for they are so few and
so remote from the work of most of the
employes that no occasion la likely to
arise in which they would incur any negli
gence whereby others would suffer.
It is quite in harmony with the whit
tling away and overthrowing of this dis
tinction,,and the sweeping of almost every
employe within the same common class,
as fellow-servants, to diminish the liabil
ity of employers for the competency of
their employes and the fitness of the ap
pliances they use. We have seen that
while they were responsible for these in
the beginning Massachusetts had led off
in declaring that an employer is not re
sponsible for the neglige -e of an agent
in not keeping them in re* .lr. One would
suppose that if It was responsible for the
fitness or suitability of an appliance In tho
beginning it logically ought to be held re
sponsible for keeping it In repair. Not
so. says the Supreme Court of Massachu
setts; we will apply a different rule. The
men who repair are fellow-agents with
those who use the appliances, and there
fore their common master is not responsi
ble for the consequence. It Is true that
the courts In most of the States repudiate
this doctrine and hold with strong reason
and sound logic that if an employer must
furnish safe and suitable appliances in
the beginning he must also keep them in
repair. It is true ho can furnish those
which are not safe and suitable If those
who use them know their true character
and the defects are so obvious that they
ought to have known them; but it should
not be forgotten that whenever the mas
ter dees this he is regarded as negligent
with respect to other servants who may
be injured by them, unless they also have
knowledge concerning them. With re
spect to these, therefore, the master'9 lia
bility continues In the same way and to
the same extent aa though their defective
character was unknown by any one save
himself. ALBERT S. BOLLES.

pany."
Another Federal Case.
The rulo in the Ross case was after
ward applied by one of the Judges who
took part in its decision, Justice Miller,
while sitting as a Circuit Court Judge. A
common hand, engaged in distributing
iron rails . alonj? Â¦ the Bide of a railroad
track, was Injured through the negligence
of the engineer who was managing the
switching engine used In transferring cars
from one place to another. After deciding
that the common hand and the engineer
were not fellow-servants he added that
this was "the necessary result of the
latest decision of the Supreme Court of
the United States on the same subject "
meaning the Ross case.
California.
Lastly may be mentioned the approval
of this case by the Supreme Court of Cal
ifornia, which regards the opinion of Jus
tice Field as "learned and admirable "
The court also adds: "Courts have gone
bo ' far as to relieve from responsibility
corporations acting through 1 general
agents within the scope of their author
ity, classing; the foremen, managers and
suserintendenti with those under them am
XVXâ What does the United States
Supreme Court SayP
A few years ago the United States Su
preme Court was required to answer this
question: An engineer named Ross. In
the employ of the Chicago. Milwaukee and
St. Paul Railroad, was Injured through
the negligence of the conductor of his
train. It collided with another, and he
had neglected to give the engineer an
order for the running of his train, as the
rules of the company require. The en
gineer sued the company, and It sought to
shield itself behind the rule that the en
gineer and conductor were fellow-ser
vants. What answer did the court make?
The opinion was given by Justice Field.
He began by inquiring, "What Is essential
to render the service In which different
persons are engaged a common employ
ment?" He remarked that the question
had caused great conflict of opinion, and
then' described how far the English courts
had gone in sweeping men employed by
the same person Into the same class as
fellow-servants. One of these cases, which
perhaps had gone further than any other
In this country, was Holden vs\ Fitchburg
Railroad, decided by the Supreme Court
of Massachusetts, in w'hich the court held
that an employe could not maintain an
action against his employer for an Injury
caused by the fault or negligence of an
other employe, eveii^ though the two were
not working in company nor had any op
portunity to control or influence the con
duct of each other. Indeed, the rule tha.t
they were fellow-servants extended "to
every case in which the two, deriving
their authority and their compensation
from the same source, are engaged In the
same business, though in different depart
ments of duty." Accordingly It was held
that In that case that a corporation was
not liable to abrakeman on one of its trains
for injuries suffered from the negligent
setting up and use of a derrick by work
men employed In widening the railroad,
on the old ground, forsodth, that he was
a fellow-servant with those employed
about the derrick. That case marks the
extreme verge of the law, and no other
In this country, except the Farwell case,
the oldest dealing with the subject, was
cited to sustain such an advanced posi
tion.
After this Introduction Justice Field
took up the immediate question. He re
marked that there was a clear distinction
between servants of a corporation that
exercised no supervision over others en
gaged with them In the same employment
and its agents who were clothed with the
control of a distinct department. "A con
ductor having the entire control and man
agement of a railway train occupies a
very different position from the brake
men, the porters and other subordinates
employed. He is, in fact, and should be.
treated as the personal representative of
the corporation, for whose negligence It is
responsible to subordinate servants."
Justice Field then reviewed several
cases in which thl3 opinion had been de
clared by the State courts, dwelling at
length on the Keary case, decided by the
Supreme Court of Ohio, -which was noticed
in a previous article. Four judges dissent
ed, however, so that the rule was adopted
by a bare majority of the court. As soon
as it was announced friends and critics
quickly rose to the surface. It was clear
ly contrary to the prevailing view in
many States, yet the rule was. deemed
most Just and wise by those who under
stood it3 far-reaching Importance.
North Carolina State Court's Action.
The State courts had not long to wait
f or" an opportunity to use the Ross de
cision as an authority in support of their
rulings, or to frown upon it. In almost
every case the opinion was regarded with
favor. The Supreme Â» Court of North
Carolina was one of the first to give ut
terance. The occasion was the review of
the case of Mason against the Danvillo
Railroad. The court boldly said that the
Ross case contained "the clearest anl
most philosophical discussion of the sub
ject," who are servants engaged ln> a
common employment, "to be found in any
authority to which we have had access."
This view of a conductor's relation to his
employer "seems to us a reasonable and
Just one, and it will insure care in the se
lection of such agents, and thus giva
greater security to the servants engaged
under him In an employment requiring the
utmost vigilance "on their part and prompt
and unhesitating obedience to his orders."
Louisiana. '<?vt'
In Louisiana the Supreme Court, after
regarding the decision with favor, de
presslngly remarked that "in matters of
this kind where one enters upon the study
of the inflnlteTfumber of decisions which
had been rendered by a multitude of
courts, he encounters a maze of contra
dictory decisions and an infinite variety
of qualifications which stupefy the mind
and render it impossible to reach a con
clusion consistent with them all." "No
doubt," added the court. "thl9 principle
might receive extension to other relations
between officers having the right to com
mand and subordinates subject to such
command."
South. "Carolina and Colorado.
In South Carolina the Supreme Court
strongly opposed the rule in Rosi* case,
the court remarking: "It seems to us
clear that unless tha conductor of a rail
road train is, while in charge of the train,
the representative of the company, then
the train is being run without any repre
sentative. He has entire charge of the
train and every â¢ employe on it is subject
to his orders." ,
The Ross decision was also opposed by
the Supreme Court of Colorado. The case
calling for an application of the rule re
lated to a superintendent or foreman en
gaged in extending a railroad, who had
negligently injured one of the men em
ployed under him. The foreman hai
changed the tools and cars U3ed in doing
the work and .employed and discharged
the men. The court remarked that in no
proper sense of thÂ« term was he a fellow
servant with the injured employe. "TTn
company had placed him in charge of th*>
â¢work, with full direction to control anil
supervise it, and he must be treated in'
reference to this work as its representa
tiveâas vice principal. The company Is
answerable to all the under-servants for
the negligence of such a representative
â¢while acting within the scope of his em
ployment."
Virginia.
In Virginia this question has arisen sev
eral times since the decision in the Ross
case, and the rule has been approved. In
ohe of them while a train was still the
conductor required a brakeman to get on
a freight car and let off the brake. As he
Â¦was getting on top the conductor signaled
the engineer to back up: he obeyed, the
cars came together and the brakeman was
crushed. The company was held liable,
because the conductor was regarded as its
agent, and not the fellow-servant of the
brakeman. "The negligence of the con
ductor was the negligence of the com-

elected to the Illinois State Senate. In
which body he took a prominent part dur-
ing last winter's session.
Senator Dwyer haa recommended
Paine's celery compound to many of his
friends, and has yet to hear anything but
the most favorable results from any of
them.
Busy men and women threatened with
failure of nerve force and showing the
effect of too prolonged, too hard or too
anxious work by periods of languor, de-
pression, nervousness, dyspepsia or other
signs of nerve exhaustion will find Paine's
celery compound an invigorator as supe-
rior to all other remedies as modern sci-
entific methods are superior to old-fash-
loned. Inaccurate ones.
When Paine's celery compound is used,
other members of the family are quick to
see the great pain in health.
Paine's celery compound is the one
known nerve feeder and nerve restorative.
By its means all the functions of the
body receive a fresh supply of nerve food.
Tt encourages the body to produce an
abundant supply of this indispensable
vital force, without which there can be no
health, strength nor happiness In living.
From tho lack of nerve force men and
women are driven to despondency, melan-
choly. Insanity an^ suicide.
ThÂ«Â»re will he no neuralgia, no persistent
headaches, no dyspepsia, no haunting pain
over the eyes, no nervous exhaustion If
Paine's celery compound is used.
Senator Dwyer Las held many positions
of trust, both In the city and State.
Elected Southw-eFt town clerk, before he
had concluded his term Mayor Wash-
tmrne appointed him superintendent of
the city water office. Later he became
West town assessor, and in 1E*4 was
"Gentlemen: It is with sincere pleasure
that I furnish this testimonial to the su-
perior merits of Paine's celery compound.
I have found it an efficacious and agree-
able rempfiy for various complaints which
refused to yield to other forms of treat-
ment, and I can cheerfully recommend it.
"EDWARD M. DWYER"
Senator Dwyer had used various medi-
cines, and .hey had done him no good.
Just how Paine's celery compound was
f.r?t brought to his attention, he does not
remember, but It has done so much for his
health that it has no more enthusiastic
ndvocate In th*Â» city of Chicago. He gives
full credit to Paine's celery compound for
the great improvement In his health.
"SfT.at* Chamber, General Assembly,
6prlnpfield, 111.. Feb. 25. 1900.
Palne's celery compound has been for
years, and l^row.the general prescription
of mo?t enaisent practitioner? cf medicine
In this country. It Is tho result of the best
prier.tlSc knowiâ¬dge and research of the
last Quarter of a century. It-Is In no sense

weakness In the two leaders carried prices ex
cept for Southern Pacific down again, .leaving
only a few insignificant net gains among the
large list of losses. Â¦ There was no news to ac
count for the movement In Southern Pacific

stock that an advance in it* price was long

EASTERN MARKETS.
I CHICAGO, Jan. 29. â The .wheat market was
{ kept alive for the most part by scalpers and
! although the volume of trade was rather small,
I the tone was firmer under the Influence .of
emaller receipts, steadier cables in- the face of
the decline here yesterday and reports of strong
er cash situation. May opened %c higher at
76% to 76i4c and sold early at 78%c. Moderate
commission house' buying, tome of it alleged
to be for Wall , street _ and covering by. shorts
resulted In a gradual recovery to .76%c. The
close was firm. May %0%c higher at 76%c.
Moderate primary receipts and a report of two
loads sold here for export helped the market
during the latter half of the session, but shorts
gave the best support; throughout, having sold
rather heavily yesterday. -
Corn . was rather heavy. The excellent
weather for Â¦ movement, Â¦ together with urgent
cash, demand, led to selling by longs and oth
ers. The market recovered a bit In sympathy
with the wheat firmness, but, the closing tone
was without independent strength. May closing
â¢,4S'Uc ' lower.
Oats were fairly steady within a narrow mar
gin. May closing %c lower. - -
Provisions were firm because hog receipts
were SOCO head, under the estimate. Â¦ May pork

Weather Report.
â¢â¢Orchards and vineyards are in (rood condi
tion, the cool weather at the beginning of the
m<->nth having been most beneficial in checking
pr'r-mature budding of deciduous fruHs. Tree
and vine pruning are progressing. Citrus fruit
trees arc doing well, but in some sections
would be ber.eSted by a rainfall eufflclently
fceavy to reach the roots."
""Grain Is looking well and has made rapid
frrowth during the week. The acreage sown
to wheat, barley and oats is already large and
Is being increased rapidly in nearly all sec
tion*, as farmers appear confident that the
season Is to be unusually fa\"orable. Pastur
age and alfalfa have also been greatly bene
fited by the favorable conditions during the
rast week. Gre^n feed is abundant in all
jArts of thf State ar.d cattle and sheep are In
l-rlme condition. Plowing, and seeding have
continued, except In places where the soil is too
nolft.
The Weather and Crops.
A. G. McA<J!e. section director of the climate
and crop service of the Weather Bureau. make3
the following report for the week ending Mon
day:
"The temr>erature has continued above nor
mal In nearly all parts of the State during the
week, and no injurious frosts have occurred.
luin has fallen at intervals In all sections, the
precipitation having been mostly in Iieht show
ers, which have beon very beneficial to all
growing crops an3 have not seriously retarded
farm work. In Southern California, where the
rain was Ftill falling th.1? morning, the soil is
row in excellent condition. &nd prospects there
and in all other sections are unusually good for
heavy crcps of grain and hay. In the foothill
district? back of San Diego the rainfall for the
week is reported as over two inches.
"Raisins are steady, with llfrht demand.
Prunes are dull and easy. There is a better
jobbing Inquiry for the very small sizes, sup
plies cf which are not particularly heavy.
There are less offerings of prunes from the
coast, but some goods are Etili tr> be had at
H^ t <<" under the ossoclation. Aprleota and
unpeeled peaches are going out somewhat bet
ter. Pates ar; lower and easy. Sale of i00
box<"s Sair was reported yesterday at 2^c.
Prime evaporated apples are slightly firmer,
holders asking 5c. Choice and fancy axe firm.
Nuts cro dull."
Mail advice* from New York say:
"Â¦Conditions In dried fruits and nuts con
tinue quiet. The arrival of 7C0,bbls of currants
via Rotterdam, which was noted in this column
yesterday, has caused a further decline in
Amallaf. the market now being quotable from
S5"S\Â»e on this grade. Rather a better jobbing
demand if apparent for currants, but orders
an? for very small lots. The market abroad
f till continues firm.

that the promised statement would be with
held until 3 p. m.. Instead of being published
at 11 o'clock. During the afterncon the stock i
: sot as high as 41*4. but eloped at a net loss of
: %Â¦ The prevailing etate of mind of speculators
in the stock was evidently one of entire un
certainty as to the effect the statement would !
have on holders and the uncertainty Is likely |
to continue, as no action has been taken on the *
actual question of the dividend. The congested I
ond uneven character of the trading Is Ttidl- j
cated by the fact that not a single share of
men a usually active stock as sugar was sold I
until well into the second hour of trading and j
the first fale of Tennessee Coal was recorded j
after 1 o'clock. ,
A considerable export of gold on Thursday is
pxsured and already $L50O,0CO has been bespoken
In a tentative majiner at the assay office. Th
continued advance here of sterling exchange
strengthened the supposition that' the outward
movement of gold from New York will shortly
bo diverted from Paris to London.

PATROLMAN J. J. McSHANE is of
the opinion that he is lucky to be

about 160 pounds, fell a distance
of fully thirty feet early yes

Patrolmen McShane and Prowse were
standing at the corner of Pine and
Kearny streets about 3:40 o'clock yester
day mornlngr, when their attention was
attracted by a woman's cries for assist

woman in her nishtrobe on the, fire es
cape in front of the Gailhard Hotel. A
man was holding her by her garment*
and endeavoring to get her batk to
aij open window on the second floor.
Prowse ran into the hotel to reach tha
struggling pair, while. McShano stood un
derneath the ladder to await develoo

than McShane expected. The man sud
denly released his hold of the woman;
she took a flying leap from the fire escape
and landed on top of McShane's head.
McShane quickly picked himself up from
the sidewalk and found that he was still

GIRL'S STRANGE STORY
OF BEING ABDUCTED
Says She Was Held a Prisoner by
Frlsnda and Kept Hidden In
a Trunk.
TACOMA. Jan. 29.â Annabel Fox, who
disappeared from her home in Everett a
weel: ago, has returned to her parents
with a peculiar abduction story which
was at first difficult to believe. She says
she was kept a prisoner by Fred Wil
liams and his wife, who pretended to be
friends of her parents and who joined in
the search for her when she was mies
ing. She claims to have been kept a
prisoner in their house, spending most of
the timo on the second floor. Whenever
a visitor came into the house she was
put into a large black trunk which was
closed nearly tight. Just enabling her to
breathe. Part of the time she was con
cealed at the hou.se of Mr. Elwell, a
friend cf the Williams*. Annabel claims
that Mtp. Williams is a shoplifter; and
that their purpose was to train her to
become a shoplifter too. She demurred
and finally, on Sunday, was allowed to go
home.
Monday her parents got oui a warrant
for Williams 1 arrest, and yesterday he
was taken into custody. He will have a
hearing latrr in the week. There is much
feeling in E\erett over the affair. Mr
and Mrs. Fox wore greatly alarmed when
Annabel failed to return from a friend's
where they supposed she had gone It
was first throught she had been take'n to
Tacoma or Seattle, but inquiry failed to
secure any trace of her. The girl was
fairly well treated. Food was carried up
to her regularly. *
E2TCOTJRAGING REPOBT
OF GIBSON OIL STRIKE
Product Said to Bu of a Good Quality
and the Well Flowing
Freely.
WOODLAND, Jan. 29.â A. M. Eaton, a
merchant of thi3 city, has returned from
an inspection of the oil strike on the Gib
eon place, west of Arbuckle. The hole in
the hill iw. about as large as an ordinary
barrel. The flow has been checked by the
construction of a temporary levee, which
dams the water above the source of the
oil spring. The present flow is therefore
confined to seepage. The seepage oil is
spread over the surface of the pond for a
half-mile, and even shows on Bear Creek.
There are four tanks op the ground, all of
which are two-thirds full. The flow ot
water and oil was in a three-Inch stream
In the proportion of one part water and
two parts oil. The water and oil were
peparated by means of cocks at the bot
tom of the tanks. Â¦ A large tank of 1500
gallons capacity was filled in about thirty
minutes. There is no road to the spring.
The tanks were taken to the top of the
hill and rolled down the incline. Opera
tions are not likely to be resumed until a
road is constructed and sufficient tank ca
pacity for an emergency is provided. Mr.
Eaton brought with him a bottle of the
oil and estimates its commercial value to
be four or five times greater than the

Investigation Being Made by State

the Exact Location of
the Well.
Special Dls.natch to The Ca.U
AUSTIN, Tex.. Jan. 29.â The oil from
the great Lucas gusher, near Beaumont,
may become the property of the State
of Texas. State Land Commissioner
Charles Rogan to-day discovered that the
public free school land act. passed by the
State Legislature in 18S3. contains a pro
vision that all oils and minerals found on
school lands on and after the date of the
passage of that law shall belong to the
State At the date of the passage of that
act rcarlv all the land in that section of
FaVTexas which is embraced In the new
oil neld belonged to the school fund and
v, a( . Â«i *ioo b^t?n sold.
It to not yet definitely known whether
the I ucas pusher is situated on land that
formertv belonged to the school fund and
has been sold since the passage of the act
of 1SS3. An Investigation with the view of
determining this fact Is now In progress,
â¢inri if it is found that the Lucas well Is
Â«tate property steps may be taken to give
the owners thereof relief after the State
ha** received its proper remuneration for
the oil. The discovery that a big portion
of the prospective oil lands of East Texas
formerly belonged to the school fund and
has been s=o!d since the passage of the act
of 1*S3 may have a depressing effect on
the oil development work in that region
unless the provision embraced in that- act
which gives to the State all oil discovered
on s=uch lands is repealed without delay.
The matter will be at once called to the
attention of the Legislature, which is now
in session.
The State still owns large tracts of land
in the prospective oil region of East Tex
as and the State Land. Omee is being
overwhelmed with applications from par
ties who desire to purchase or lease BUch
lands. â¢ The applications are being acted
upon as rapidly as possible.
The charter of the Beaumont Geyser Oil
Company of Beaumont, with a capital
ptock of* $1,000,000. was filed in the Secre
tary of State's office to-day. The purpose
of the company is to construct and oper

FIELD MARSHAL GOTJRKO.
Greats st of His Military Feats Was
Crossing the Balkans in "Winter.^
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23.â Field Mar
shal Count Gourko died to-day on his
estate at Charow, near Iver.
Count Joseph Vassllyevlch Gourko was
of Lithuanian origin and was born In 1S2S
and educated in the imperial "Corps de
Pages." In 1S57 he was already captain
and commanded a squadron, and was
made in li*60 adjutant to the Emperor. In
1S61 he received hla colonel's commission
and in 1SC5 was appointed commander of
the Hussar regiment of Marinpol. In 1867
the Emperor named him major general
and ordered him to be of his suite. His
heroic deeds are almost too well known
to be minutely recorded. On June 25, 1S77,
with a detachment of cavalry and a single
battery he attacked and took by assault
the strong and powerfully occupied town
of Tyrnovo. On July 5 following, he oc
cupied Kazanlyk and the villages of Shlp
ka. Hanko and others. He. with General
Radetzky. traversed the Balkans in the
middle of the winter snow storms and
frosts, with but few* losses, and led the
victorious Russian troops into, the fertile
valleys beyond, thus occupying Sofia,
Philipopolis and Adrianople.
The hazardous and almost Impossible
feat of traversing the Balkans In the mid
dle of winter will forever remain one of
the greatest deeds performed by the sol
diers of Russia,
Count Gourko was elevated to the rank
of adjutant general, was a Knight of St.
George of the second class and of several
other high orders. He was appointed Gov
.ernor General of St. Petersburg in 1870.
after #the attempts on Alexander's life,
, and then, after a period of enforced re
tirement. Governor General of Poland,
where his rule was Btrongly Muscovite In
, tendency.
; In 1SS4 when the Czar visited Poland.
General Gourko took extraordinary pre-
I cautions for his safety. In 1S91. durins:
the Russian famine, he made an optimis
tic report on the food supply in Poland.
Events proved him to have been mistaken,
and his position was in danger, but he
exculpated himself and In April. 1852. re
turned to "Warsaw as commander in chief
of all trooos in Poland and Lithuania.
Count Gourko was married to a French
lady. â¢ r.. Â¦Â¦Â¦ ,i

Word3 tipped with poi3oned spear points
flew from one elde to the other in the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday during the proceedings In the
Dubose contempt case. Thomas J. Geary.
on behalf of the Noyes-McKenzie faction,
spent considerable time and energy In ob
jecting to much of the testimony that ap
peared In" the record as handed down from
Commissioner Heacock's court. Much of
It, he said, was hearsay and not compe
tent or admissible In any court of. law or
in any proceeding. He objected particu-.
larly to Mr. Pillsbury reading from the
testimony of W. H. Metson to the effect
that Mr: Geary told*Mr. Metson in Nome
that McKenzle would not give up the
gold dust without a fight; that somÂ» one
might get killed in the matter and that if:
Metson himself was not killed he would
be responsible for whomsoever might bÂ« a
victim.
Mr. Geary grew quite warm when voic
ing his objections to the reading of this
bit of testimony. It was unheard of. he
said, that the reputation of members of
the bench and bar should be permitted to
be besmirched upon mere hearsay as to
â¢what some one said about somebody elsÂ«
In the absence of the respondent In this
contempt proceeding.
Mr. Pillsbury replied in an equally earn
est manner. "This case has no parallel
In the history of the country." he said,
"for outrageous brutality in disregard of
the law of the land and the mandates of
the courts. In the history of legal Jursl
prudence it has no equal and I defy the
gentleman to point out any parallel In
history. And I wish to say. right here
that the lawyer or the Judge that would
Jend himself to the furtherance of a con
spiracy such as this is should bÂ© pun
ished." I*
Then Mr. Geary took a turn. He re
ferred to the voluminous transcript of
testimony as "this mass of rubbish." It
was admitted in evidence, he added, under
pretext *t making a sweeping Inquiry Into
these matters. "Persons have been al
lowed to narrate rumors," he continued.
"and the street gossip of a mining camp,
all for the purpose of trying to establish
something behind this issue. That testi
mony was taken for the purpose of belnÂ«
hawked about In the city of "Washington
and gossiped about there."
"Not by me." interrupted Mr. Pillsbury.
"Xot with my knowledge or consent."
"It was gossiped about In the Capitol at
Washington." persisted Mr. Geary. "In
the early part of last December parts of
that testimony were peddled around tha
Capitol to assist the efforts being made
for the removal of Judge Xoyes. That
testimony was taken to the Attorney
General of the United States and in the
Senate of the T'nlted States."
"With reference to any use of this tes
timony elsewhere I desire to say that If
it was procured from the reporter of this
court it was done without my knowledga
or consent. I heard afterward that Mr.
Geary had the testimony in Washington,
also," replied Mr. Pillsbury.
"Yes, I took all the testimony to Wash
ington." Mr. Geary admitted.
The case was then declared submitted
to the. court and an adjournment was
taken until Jl o'clock this morning.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23.-The Right
Rev. George Montgomery, Bishop of Los
Angeles and Monterey, addressed a large
audience at Elks' Kail this evening on
"Christian Socialism." A number of
prominent citizens occupied seats on the
platform. Dr. John EL Haynes presided.
The Bishop said in brief:
NVe all fee! that in our civic life there are a
multitude of things that ne*d correction and
various mear.s sire "Â¦prci>csed" for their cor
rt-ction. ArriL>ns these eocieJismâ cf several
kindsâ is pat forward as that which promises
the best hop* of buccess. The demand for any-

lact that i-pl.-inons between capital and labor
are "'strainvd* to much that uii are suffering.
and frcm tir.;e to time things that everybody
reÂ«reu grow out of these relations. Thia
very confusion makes it difacult for any of us
to think acd act as calmly and Judiciously as
we cucht. And even if a "â¢temporary" truce
were declared we should all partake , ol its

For the adjustment of Immediate and press
ing difficulties we should have in -society, in
every State or community, as circumstances
ir.ieht demand, a board of arbitration. This
board should havÂ« the authority of a regular
court. Somewhere In its application it ehould
b* a supreme court and it should have the
i>ower to enforce its decrees.
In every cuntest between employers and em
ployes there are three parties concernedâ the
employers, the employes and those of the
community affected.
Hitherto In almost all these contests between
employer and the employe the public has tÂ«-en
a sufleir. and thus far that public has had
no voice. That board of arbitration, I believe,
should he made up of representatives from
The Bishop maintained that Christian
principles alone could bring men to the
best social system possible in this worm.
Socialism's a'dvocates -were positively and
absolutely hostile to thi?m and such so
cialism, if It should prevail, would be ab
solutely subversive of all social order
worthy the name. It* advocates had come
to believe that the Christian religion, and
rÂ«*lipion Jn genera', were hostile to the in
terests of the multitude, ar.d that relig
ion, too. must be abolished along with
the present social order. He continued:
If I unrttr^tani the definition cf "Chrli'tlan
Bociallyrr. " it has one defect that radical
enclallRn iffe'.r has. It tends to undermine
the freedom of r.:an and the eacredness of

HARD LINES
To Make a Man Toe the Mark.
To take both tobacco and coffee away
from a man seems pretty touffh. but the
doctor ordered me to quit both, -- my
health was very poor and I had got where
I could do but little work.
About a month after quittlngr I com-
menced on tobacco again, because I could
fcsxdly stand it. I got along without the
coffee for the reason that I had taken up
Postum Food Coffee, which I found very
relishing U> the appetite and wonderfully
beneficial.
I have gained twenty-five pounds by its
use, ar.d to-day I am a well man. I dis-
covered in this way that It was the old-
fashioned coffee that hurt me and not
the tobacco. When I first tried Postum
1 did not relish It, but found that it was
not made, rightâ that is. they did not boil
it long enough. Next time it came on the
table It was fine, and I have been using
it ever fiir.ee.
Mr. Fletcher, an old soldier of this place,
was troubled with dyspepsia. I told him
of try experience and my cure, and told
him to <iuit coffee and use Postum Food
Coffee. This was some time. ago. ' I saw
him yesterday, and he told me he had
not felt better in twenty years an!
nothing would induce him to go back from
roctum to the uÂ«s of common coffee. He
had the same trouble in getting: it made
right to start with.
I could give you the names of a number
cf others who have been benefited by
\irlng Dostum Food Coffee. I believe you
i are a true friend of suffering humanity.â
v -.â¢â¢ma* Spring, Deavertown, OhJ"
John AFhford of Dillon was also
troubled with dyspepsia. I told him of my
eure by the use of Poctuni Food Coffee
and 'warned him to be careful In having
the Postum cooked long 1 enough when he
did try it. To-day he is perfectly well and
his appetite never better.

Kiss Nona Ryan Meets With
, Peculiar Accident.
BERESFORD. S. D., Jan. 29.â A pretty
girl in a church pew near a redhot stove
was nearly burned to death as the result
of an explosion caused by the ignition of
a wide celluloid tuck comb In her back
hair. The peculiar accident occurred Sun
day last during the morning service at
St. Mary's Catholic Church. Miss Nona
Ryan, 19 years of age, sat near and with
her back toward the stove, a large Iron
heater of the old cannon type, which is
depended upon solely to heat the large
auditorium. Suddenly a violent explosion
took place in Miss Ryan's hair, which was
coiled upon the back of her head, and im
mediately her whole head was enveloped
in flames. The young lady's frantic cries
attracted* the attention of the congrega
tion. The priest forgot his sermon and
rushed to the aid of the unfortunate girl.
Women screamed and two or three faint
ed. Men In the pews near by rushed to
the lady's side. John L. Reedy and Rob
ert O'Reilly did their utmost to extinguish
the -flames, and failing in every other ex
pedient were forced to cut the hair from
Miss Ryan's head with a Jack-knife,
which was the only accessible instrument
at hand In the dire emergency. All par
ties were badly scorched, but will recover.

who is .wanted by United States authori
ties to "stand trial for passing counterfeit
coins In Eureka three years ago, was cap
tured to-day . In the. Pavilion Lodging
houee, by Under Sheriff Ferrill and Chief
of Police Hltchings. Curverson was ar
rested in the latter part of 189S.in this city
and was held to answer nntt sent to San
Francisco for trial before the United
States District Court. "While awalting'the
calling of his case he obtained release on
straw bonds and made his escape, as did
also the worthless sureties on the. bond,
who proved to be professional bondsmen.
â¢ The Federal authorities have known for
some time of Curverson's presence in tnis
county. They probably would have done
nothing toward apprehending him had not
more counterfeit coins appeared here.
The discovery of the last supply of coun
terfeit coins led to investigation by a de
tective of the secret service, resulting in
tne arrest of John Kelson in the early
part of this month. In Nelson's cabin a
complete electroplating plant was found.
It Is believed Curverson knows something
about this outfit, even if he is not directly
responsible for the existence of the coun
terfeit money.

United States Minister Loomis, accord
ing to the same advices, replied that these
reports were possibly exaggerated, but
that they could not be ignored and that
he would wire the facts to Washington.
PORT OF SPAIN. Trinidad. Jan. 29.-
According to advices received to-day from
Caracas, a trustworthy engineer who haa
arrived there from Pitch Lake reports
that the situation 13 critical. He say3
that 150 English negroes who were em
ployed to do police duty fled when the
insurgents began firing into the Jungles,
only twenty-five Americans being left to
protect the property and lives of Ameri
can families. The messenger' from the
lake implored the United States legation
at Caracas to afford protection, saying
that the lives and property of Americans
were exposed to guerrilla attacks, firing
around the lake going on nightly, and the
Americans are too few to hold out long.

Natives Flee Leaving- Few Whites to
SITUATION VERY CBITICAL.
The dispute between the Bermudez and
New York Asphalt Company and the
Venezuelan Government Is still unsettled.
United States Minister Loomis, not wish
ing to cause further difficulties for the
Venezuelan Government at this time, has
postponed the preaentationof an ultimatum
on the subject. United States war vessels
are expected. The Lancaster is o"n her
way to La Guayra and the Scorpion is
already there. The Venezuelan Govern
ment had advised the Bermudes Company
to appear to the Venezuelan courts, but
the company refused to do so. alleging
that the courts are under the influence of
President Castro. On the other hand, it
is said the United States Minister is mak
ing an inquiry into the dispute and that
as soon as it is ended attempts to cancel
the concession of the Bermudez Company
will no longer be tolerated.
The Venezuelan Government continues
to send troops to Cumana. and advices
from Barcelona say that the Government
troops In that neighborhood are pursuing
the insurgents very actively. '- .V J
Only, vague reports reach Mere regard
ing the events which are transpiring in
the vicinity of Carupano. That town is
first in the possession of the insurgents
and then again occupied by the Govern
ment. As this dispatch Is forwarded the
Government troops are occupying Caru
pano, where the French cruiser Suchet
remains at anchor. All is quiet on the
island of Marguerite, where the people
who fled from Carupano sought refuge,
and who were arrested as suspicious per
sons.
. According to information -which reaches
this port, the island of Pa to, situated off
the port of Gueria, is in the power of the
Venezuelan revolutionists, who are said
to have defeated the Government troops
commanded by General Velutini, In the
neighborhood of Irapa; but the Vene
zuelan Government has published an of
ficial bulletin denying that the insurgents
were victorious on this occasion.

Hugh Duffy, the former Boston captain"
has signed a formal contract to manage
the Milwaukee American League team for
the season.
The American League will submit con
tracts to its players on the plan advo
cated by the Players' Protective Associa
tion. This plan involves a graded system
of contractsâ of three; four and five years
no player to be bound for a period longer
than five years. At the end of that time
he will be free to accept offers from any
other club. It is also planned to do away
with the "farming" system, a clause in
the contracts providing -that "no player
shall be traded, farmed or sold to any
other club, except with his consent."
So far as legislation on the playing rules
is concerned, no important change la
looked for, although possibly action may
be" taken in the direction of abolishing the
bunt hit. McGraw, however, has ex
pressed strong opposition to any such ac
tion.
"The playing schedule will be given out
at the March meeting," said President
Johnson at the close of to-day's meeting
"The American League will go ahead re
gardless of any other organization,
though, as far as that is concerned, we do
not anticipate any serious conflict In the
schedules.

In honor of the anniversary of the birth
of President McKinley the Bohemians of
America gave their second annual State
banquet last night at the Spreckels rotis
serle.
One .hundred and fifty Bohemians sat
down to a feast of cheer and good fellow
ship at the conclusion of a prayer offered
by Grand Prior Emlllo Lastreto. and dur
ing the evening listened to telegrams of
felicitation from absent brethren. A dis
patch of congratulation was sent to the
President, and the company drank a toast
proposed by Grand Chief Host H. B.
Mehrmann to his health and preservation.
Patriotic songs constituted the musical
programme, and an even half-dozen
toasts were responded to by Bohemians
Isadore Golden, Emilto Lastreto, A. "W.
Fielder, H. W. Pulclfer, F. D. Brandon
and W. E. von Johannsen. A handsome
engraving of President McKinley hung
over Toastmaster W. H. Church s ros
trum, festooned artistically in the na
tional colors. Representatives from the
hospitiums at San Jose, Oakland and Los
Angeles were present at the banquet.
The Bohemians of America is*a recent
organization. It Is essentially social in Its
purposes and Is now known in nearly
every city In the State.
Its banquets will be held hereafter on

dent of the United States. Its member

election of Thomas F. Graham. Before
making their motion for a dismissal, how
ever, they will. go as far as the rules of
pleading will permit to protect Graham
from possible complications, sure to arise
upon the filing of Stephen V. Costello'a
motion to be declared the legally elected
candidate for the Suocrior bench. Judgn
Daingerfleld' s cpunsel feel that, having
forced Graham into th* contest and hav
ing, through the interposition of objec
tions, thrown out Graham votes until the
number accredited to him on the count
record is smaller than that accredited to
Costello by the Blection Commission, they
should now take action with the object In
view of protecting the respondent, Gra
ham.
When the contest was called yesterday
morning a continuance until this morning
was asked and granted. This morning
Judge Daingerneld's counsel will make a
motion to amend their pleadings. If tho
motion is granted the contestant's com
plaint will be so amended as to question
the number of ballots actually received Dy
Costello and will deny that he received
the number accredited to him by the Elec
tion Commission, but a number smaller
than that actually received by either
Daingerfleld or Graham. This will force
Costello to either continue the contest re
cently instituted by himself or abandon
his proposed motion.
Judge Daingerfleld owes his defeat to
the existence of the so-called Almshouse
precinct. In this precinct Judge Dainger
fleld was strongly supported, but a largo
majority of the ballots cast for him were
fatally defective. When this precinct was
reached Judge Daingerfleld was in the
lead of his opponent, having gained som?
400 votes, but here he fell behind and has
since been unable to overcome his loss.
I Though the ballpts In many precincts
yet remain to be recounted. Judge Dain
gerfield's attorneys have decided to aban
don the contest. In all of the precincts
remaining he was given large majorities
and, believing that the usual percentage
of defective ballots would be found if
these precincts were recounted, which
would cause the candidates who received
the greater number of ballots on election
day to lose the greater number udoil' the
recount, Daingerfield's counsel have de
cided to abandon the right to the office to
Graham.

SUES TO ENJOIN
THE BIG FIGHT
Attorney General of State of
Ohio "Acts at Request
of Governor.
Jeffries and Ruhlin Included Among
the Defendants as Well as the
. Trustees of the Saengerfest
Association. *
CINCINNATI, Jan. 29.â Suit was begun
to-day before Judge Howard Holllster of
the Common Pleas Court to enjoin the
Saengerefest Association from holding
the Jeffrles-Ruhlin contest February 15.
This proceeding is. In the name of the
State and was begun by Attorney General
Sheets at the direction of Governor Nash.
The petition, declares the proposed prize
fight to be a nuisance and a restraining
order Is wanted on that account rather
than under any sections of the i Ohio
statutes pertaining to prize fighting.
No application fbr an injunction was
made to-day, as it is desired first to have
notices served on the defendants, so as to
have a hearingr'6n the merits of the case,
ine defendants are the original Saengei
fest trustees, the members of the Saenger
fest Athletic Association. Jeffries and
Ruhlin and the members of the Zoological
Association, on whose ground the Saen
gerfest Hall stands. The petition" avers
that the contest would cause a gatherlnx
of "toughs" and idle and vicious people,
whose presence In crowds would be a
menace to life, good order, property and
tno general welfare of the community.
Itiis ordered that the attorneys of the
Saengerfest Athletic Association will not
only accept the service immediately, but
will also request as early a hearing as
possible. Arguments may be made on the
application for an Injunction on Thurs
day, when the attorneys of the opponents
of the flght will attempt to show that a
contest for the heavyweight champion
ship of the world is not such as can come
under the Ohio statutes. They will then
show what they mean by a petition to en
join a nuisance. Those seeking to pre
vent the flght have certainly engaged a
formidable array of legal talent, including
Judge Judson Harmon, who was Attorney
General under Cleveland; Gustave Wald,
John W. Warrlngton, Lawrence Maxwell
Jr., formerly Solicitor General of the
United States; E. W. KIttredge and J. "W.
Herron.
Jeffries and Ruhlin, who were arrested
last night and held in $1000 bond, will have
their hearing on Thursday. Very little In
terest Is taken in this proceeding brought
In the court of Squire Roebllng, as it is
understood to be a friendly action under
section 7117 of the Ohio statutes, and that
the defendants will both be released after
their hearing on Thursday.
COLUMBUS, Jan. 29.â Governor Nash
said to-day that the. arrests of the princi
pals in the Cincinnati prize fight would
have no possible effect upon the proceed
ings Instituted by Attorney General Sheets
In the Cincinnati courts to-day to enjoin
the fight. He declined to make any fur
ther statement concerning tlfe matter.
Attorney General Sheets said that the ar
rest of Jeffries and Ruhlin was undoubt
edly made to anticipate a criminal action
on the part of the State. They had.evi
dently not anticipated the action that had
been begun.

Oscar ToIIe, a 30 to 1 shot, ran third. -
Torsida. with Tommy Burns in the sad
dle, let the taient down hard by her show
ing in the mile and a t-ixteenth selling af
fair. Never displaying any markei
amount of speed, tho mare ran last. In
a fierce dr've Winnie O'Connor, astride
Josephine b, the second choice, got up in
time to get the decision from Free Lance
by a head. With a t.iore vigorous rid?
Key del Bandidos would have downed
both of the leaders.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's mare. Good
Hope, took the seven-furlong number,
aiso a selling affair, from a big field of
pUters. Her odds went from 2 to 13 to 5.
and after catching AlK-viale she won very
cleverly from Kacctto. Meadow Lark
came from the rear, dropping into third
place. La Mascotta had quite a following.
but seems to have lost her staying qual
ities.
Eddie Kaufman cam? very close to put
ting Katie Wolcott over the plate in the
eix-furlor.g dash for n.aidens, which fol
lowed... The Prince Royal mare, piloted
by Pecro Enos. had h^r odds swiped from
30 to *, and showed the way into thÂ«
â¢tretrfi. StoppinK perceptibly under Ihn
fast clip set, the was passed by Pat
Dunnes Tola, and beaten in a walk.
Brenhilda. the favorite, ran a very poor
race, failing to get inside the money.
A stranger was sprung in the last event,
over one mile and a sixteenth, that got all
the money. Lew White brought The Phoe
nician up from Monterey and at 6 to 1 the
ge'.dir.g made a runaway race of it. Ar
tHla. the even-money favorite, ridden by
Mounce. took the place, six lengths before
Burdock. . -

iC X medical science. I had hemor-

*Cnni.Ul'jtÂ» Woo, the eminent Chinese phy-
slclan was called, and with on* dosa oÂ£ his
tea stopped the flow of blood, thereby wring
my life as I had been given up by my whttÂ»
physician, as well as by all my friends. Wu
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. Won* Woo's
wonderful skill he saved my life from this most
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume my
vocation In six months from the time I went to
bed, and now I weigh 202 pounds, more than I
bad ever attained previously. I would cheerfully
recommend Dr. Wong Woo tq any onÂ« In need
