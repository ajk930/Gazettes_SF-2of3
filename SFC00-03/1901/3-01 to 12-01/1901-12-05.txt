POLL MADE BY THE CALL SHOWS
THAT CONGRESS IS FOR EXCLUSION
THE CALL is enabled to announce that Congress will pass a stringent law for the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the shores of America. To ascertain the sentiment
of members of the Senate and House of Representatives, correspondents of The Call have made a careful poll. This shows that a law more binding than the Geary act
will be enacted by Congress without delay. In the House the exclusion bill will have 239 votes out of a total of 357, and 56 Senators out of 90 will vote for exclusion.

remaining in this country be a menace to
government or society in general, he may
direct that In addition to other punish
ments adjudged, the convicted alien, after
undergoing Buch punishments, shall be
1-leported at the expense of the United
"%iates to the country from which he came,

Eight Men.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Dec. 4.â The British ship
Nelson Is believed to have turned turtle
during the terrible storm last night and
gone to the bottom, carrying her crew
of twenty-eight men. Tugboat owners
here are Inclined to be optimistic, but
there is ample reason for tne fear that
the ship has been lost. "Whether or not
this Is the case will not be known until
to-morrow, by which time, if the Nelson
is still afloat, she should be sighted off
the Columbia.
The Nelson sailed from Astoria on No
vember 25 for the United Kingdom, car
rying a cargo of 63,715 bushels of wheat,
valued at $35,700. It has been said that
she was overloaded, but the truth of this
assertion canno* be vouched for. What
transpired during the seven days" whÂ«ch
elapsed before the ship was again sighted
is not known here, but it Is presumed the
vessel was damaged during the gales
which raged along the coast. On Mon
day night she was reported to be off the
river, looking for a tug, though she was
not flying distress signals at the time.
Testerday morning the tug Wallula
took hold of the Nelson, and later the
tug Tattoosh also passed a hawser. It
was the intention to bring the vessel Into
port, but the bar was very rough and the
attempt was abandoned.
Lights Suddenly Disappear.
The tugs held on to the Nelson until
late In the afternoon, when a gale came
up. The storm was so severe that the
vessel would have been driven ashore
had the tugs remained In their position,
so the Tattoosh started with the Nelson
for Puget Sound. The Wallula. being
short of fuel, returned to port. ' '
The start for the north was made at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. At that
hour the storm was quite severe, but
later as night came on the gale increased
in fury and soon reached the proportions
of a hurricane. The great steel hawser
held until 9:43 o'clock last night, when at
the height of the gale It suddenly snapped
close to the ship. Instantly the vessel's
lights, which were easily distinguishable
before that time, disappeared.
Whether the Nelson turned turtle time
alone will tell. The storm was a terrific
one and the seas were running mountain
high. The Tattoosh stood by, and during
the remainder of the night looked for the
vessel, without finding the slightest trace
of her. It Is usual under such circum
stances for a ship to flash a blue light,
thus acquainting the tug with the fact
that all is well on board. This was not
done by the Nelson, nor could any other
light be seen, though the tug made
thorough search in the vicinity. When
day broke there was no trace of the ship.
Tug Captains Are Hopeful.
Captain Bailey of the Tattoosh believes
the vessel is safe and that she will show
up at Cape Flattery to-morrow. He says
he realizes she may have met disaster,
but believes the chances are In favor of
her being safe. All of the tugboat men
were reticent when asked about the con
dition of the Nelson at the time she was
picked up. Captain Pcrriam of the Nel
son Is reported to have said that all his
canvas except a jib was carried away,
but the tugboat men refuse to confirm
this. All agree, however, that the vessel
would be at the mercy of the elements
unless she were provided with sails.
It is also said the Nelson's bulwarks
and boats had been smashed and that
Bhe was generally In a crippled condition.
She was a stanch ship and efficiently
commanded. A tug has been ordered out
from the Sound to look for her, while two
tugs will leave Astoria In the morning on
a similar mission. From the best in
formation at hand. It would appear the
chances for the vessel's safety are slen
der. \,

for Relief of the
Island.
Governor "Wood x Aids Him
in 'Enlisting Strong
Sympathy.
Some Measure of Reciprocity on Su

Declare, Be Immediately
Granted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., Dec 4.â President Roosevelt, with
able and persistent support from Secre
tary Root and General Leonard Wood, Is
forcing to the front the question of relief
for Cuba. It will speedily become the
absorbing question before Congress and
afford the first test of the new President's
influence with the legislative branch. He
is urging immediate action In order to in
sure the tranquillity and prosperity of the
island and aserts that unless something
is done within a month the consequnces
will be serious.
Furthermore the administration takes
the position that responsibility for the
peace and happiness of Cuba now rests
.wttjh Congress and that It is the great
moral question, of the hour.
So urgent is the President In this mat
ter that he Is taking every possible oppor
tunity to put the situation before the Sen
ate and House leaders and General Wood
is here for the purpose of explaining
Cuban conditions to the lawmakers.
To-day Wood was at the Capitol In long
consultation with leading Senators, urg
ing some immediate measure of reciproc
ity on Cuban sugar and tobacco, particu
larly the former.
Wood Talks of Cuba.
General Wood has come: to Washing
ton from Cuba at the request of the
President and Secretary Root and last
night he met at Roosevelt's table such
well known protection Senators as Hanna,
Platt of Connecticut, Elklns, Kean, Bev
eridge and Scott and explained to them
the necessity for immediate relief.
General Wood admits frankly that he
has radically changed his views In regard
to the Cuban situation. He formerly held
the opinion that Cuba would soon become
prosperous in spite of a lack of reciprocal
relations with the United States; that she
would work out her own salvation, ones
free, and in fact that there were no clouds
in the Cuban skies. Personal observation
of months and close contact with leading
business men have, however, convinced
him that something must be done by the
American Congress before any commercial
advancement can be made. Part of the
sugar crop in the island is ready to be
ground and the rest Is ready to cut. Un
less some arrangement can be made for a
market In the United States a tremendous
loss will be the result.
Cubans Entertain Hope.
The Cubans are waiting and time la an
Important factor. They point to Porto
Rico and say that under the present com
mercial relations sugar plants there are
yielding 40 per cent on the Investment.
They point to the fact that Cuba buys
annually. $37,000,000 In goods from England
and Germany because the United States
markets are not open to' their products
and they pointedly ask why we should
spend blood and money in freeing
Cuba and then allow others to reap the
reward. All this Is from the standpoint
of a Cuban, as related by General Wood.
The administration takes the position
that relief for the Island does not in
volve a question of revenue at home. It
is not a matter of much Importance to
any great industry in the United States,
but it is everything to the Cubans. It
means prosperity or panic, hope or de
spair, tranquillity or uprisings. 'â  â 
Hardly had the President's recommend
ations regarding Cuba been read in Con
gress when he began reinforcing his
message by direct and indirect appeals to
the leading members. It is , not denied
that these have been effective, and Sen
ator Proctor's support and possibly that
of Senator Aldrich, a very Important
man, are said to have. been gained.
President Urges Belief.
One argument prominently advanced by
tne high tariff public men is that any
concessions to Cuba now would put the
inhabitants in a position of so much in
dependent prosperity that they ' would
never desire to come into the United
States should we need them or care to
have them. The President insists, how
ever, that the present question of relief
shall be considered entirely Independent
of the possible future annexation. That
tea question of the future and manifest
destiny. Our duty nor/ is to help Cuba

SUPPRESSION

Statesmen to Inaugurate a Crusade

Amend Constitution it
Necessary.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Practically
the entire time of the Senate to-day was
devoted to the introduction of bills and
resolutions. Two of these measures, re
lating to the suppression of anarchy and
dealing with anarchism, were allowed
to lie on the table, so that their author3,
McComas of Maryland and Vest of Mis
souri, may bring them to the early at
tention of the Senate. The isthmian
canal report was transmitted to the Sen
ate by the President, and several bills
providing for the construction of the
waterway, one of them by Morgan of
Alabama, who has led the movement for
the canal In the past, were presented.
McComas of Marylar.1 gave notice that
he would address the Senate at rts next
session concerning assaults on the Presi
dent, the deportation of anarchists, etc.
Vest Proposes an Inquiry.
Vest of Missouri offered a resolution
proposing an Inquiry by the Committee
on Judiciary as to the powers of Con
gress to deal with anarchy, to suppress
the teaching of anarchy and to provide a
penal colony for convicted anarchists.
The resolutions and an anti-anarchist
measure by McComas are on the Senate
table open to early debate.
The Vest resolution directs the Judi
ciary Committee to inquire If Congress
has power to legislate for the punish
ment of anarchists who assassinate or at
tempt to assassinate the President ot tne
United States, and If not whether It Is
expedient to amend the Federal consti
tution to enable Congress so to legislate.
Also, whether it is necessary and expe
dient so to amend the Federal constitu
tion as to empower Congress to prevent
by such means "as may be deemed neces
sary the teaching by anarchists of the
doctrine that all governments should be
destroyed; also whether It Is necessary
and expedient so to amend the Federal
constitution that Congress shall have
power to punish all persons belonging to
anarchistic associations; also what
amendments, if any,' are necesasry to
the naturalization laws to prevent the
coming Into this country of anarchists
and their becoming citizens of the United
States; also whether It Is necessary or ex
pedient so to amend the Federal constitu
tion as to give Congress the power to es
tablish a penal colony, on some suitable
island under the jurisdiction of the
United States, to which, after trial and
conviction, every anarchist holding the
doctrine that all governments should be
destroyed by the assassination of their
chief rulers shall be deported, and that
the committee, after due examination
and inquiry, shall recommend to the Sen
ate such amendments to the Federal con
stitution as may be necessary to prevent

paper, the Philadelphia North
American, is making an earnest
light for exclusion. Its columns
are daily filled with urgent edi
torials and with memorials and
petitions of labor organizations.
Wanamaker and Quay are po
litical enemifes, as is well known.
For this reason, Quay may pos
sibly oppose the bill, unlezs he
fears the big labor element of
Pennsylvania. Penrose, his asso
ciate, is for exclusion, and to-day
introduced a bill barring the Chi
nese. So did Qua}% but he did
it "by request."
Frye and Depew Silent.
Frye of Maine positively refuses to dis
cuss the question of exclusion, but he will
probably vote against an exclusion bill
end in favor of the Pacific railroads, as
he did in 1S92.
Senator Depew, chairman of the New
York Central board of directors, may also
oppose exclusion. He refuses to express
his views, however.
It is gratifying to observe that Chinese
exclusion will not be a party question. It
ADVERTISEMENTS.
WHAT CAUSES DEAFMESS.
She Principal Cause Is Curable but
Generally Overlooked.
Many thing's may cause deafness, and
very often it is difficult to trace a cause.
Borne people inherit deafness. Acute dis-
eases like scarlet fever sometimes cause
deafness. But by far the most common
cause of loss of hearing Is catarrh of the
head and throat.
A prominent specialist on ear troubles
gives as his opinion that nine out of ten
cases of deafness are traced to throat
trouble; this Is probably overstated, but
it is certainly true that more than half cf
all cases of poor hearing were caused by
catarrh.
The catarrhal secretion in the nose and
throat finds its way into the eustachian
tube and by clogging it up very soon af-
fects the hearing and the hardening of
the secretion makes the loss of hearing
permanent, unless the catarrh whicn
caused the trouble is cured.
Those who are hard cf hearing "mav
think this a little far fetched, but any-
one at all observant must have noticed
how a hard cold in the head will affect
the hearing and that catarrh if long ne-
glected will certainly impair the sense cZ
hearing and ultimately cause deafness.
If the nose and throat are kept clear
and free from the unhealthy secretions of
catarrh, the hearing will at once greatly
improve and anyone suffering from deaf-
ness and catarrh can satisfy themselves
on this point by using a fifty-cent box of
btuart s Catarrh Tablets, a new catarrii
cure, which in the past year has won the
approval of thousands of catarrh suffe--
crs, as well as physicians, because it is
in convenient form to use. contains no
cocaine or opiate and is as safe and pleas-
ant for children as for their elders
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is a whole-
some combination of Blood Boot, Guaia-
co li Eucalyptol and similar antiseptics
and they cure catarrh and catarrhal deaf-
ness by action upon the blood and
mucous membrane of the nose and throat
A.s one physician aptly expresses It:
Â«-\?Â£ do not have to draw upon the imagl
lnation to discover whether you are get-
ting benefit from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; improvement and relief are appar-
en t from the first tablet taken."

House, however, who are green as legis
lators, who Imagine that the fate of the
nation hangs on their utterances, and
they pleaded for time to carefully con
sider the question before expressing an
opinion on so weighty a matter.' )
Having j thus- refused to answer th-3
question, "Are you in favor of Chinese
exclusion?" they were later approached
by other emissaries of The Call who
asked, "Do you think an exclusion bill
will pass?" and in moat cases these
doubtful ones replied, "Yes." So in the
tabulated column appended many of
those who are classed as doubtful will
probably .vote for exclusion, for natural
ly if they expect the bill to pass, the in
ference would be thajt they will vote
for It. Y-,;:^::.
However, aside from the doubtful ones,
positive expressions were obtained from
enough House members to show that the
exclusion bill will muster 239 votes out
of a' total of 357; at least fifty-six Sena
tors will vote for exclusion out of a tctal
of ninety. yV/

Sir: The law of Congress providing, for

that she is entitled to be heard. Monster
conventions of merchants' associations
and labor organizations have been heid
at San Francisco and elsewhere on the

BOTH SIDES READY
FOR THE CONTEST
Chinese Lecturer Travels East,
Whib Congressman, Woods
Gathers Data.
IV order that he may be well posted
upon the Chinese question when the
exclusion law comes up before Con
gress, Hon. S. D. Woods, who repre
sents the Second District of this
State, has been gathering data from all
sources. There is no inconsiderable Chi
nese population in his district and he is
supplementing his personal knowledge
with that of others who have been more
closely in touch with them.
The following letter has been sent to
him from this city:
SAN FRAXCISCO, Dec. 5, 1901.
Hon. S. D. Woods, Member of Qonsresa;
Washington, D. Câ Sir: In answer to your
request for a statement of the moral condi
tion ot the Chinese in San Francisco. I re
spectfully submit the following:
My experiences during the past twenty-five
years as organizer of Chinese Sunday-schools
in Eastern America, as a missionary in China
and to the Chinssa of the Pacific Coast, and
as an official Chinese Interpreter in the Fed
eral courts of California, have led, me to ob
serve with much Interest and ever-growing
concern the conditions surrounding the Chi
nese laborers In California and the probable
effect of those conditions uDon the home lov
ing people of our own land, as well as upon
the Chipese themselves. . . ..-'â 
I do not speak from racial prejudice. I nave
none. What I have to say about the Chinese
with whom I have come in such close con
tact is said from a sense of duty and with the
hope that It may call attention to the alarm
ing conditions now existing in the clcse, mys
terious, fetid atmosphere of the Chinatown ct
San Francisco so apparent io any worker
amcts the Chinese of that quarter.
Is the spring of 1SS6 I had occasion to ad
drejs a Sunday evening audience In the Chorcn
of Strangers In New York City. Upon that oc
casion 1 said in effect that durins my five
years' rsstdence in the part of the province
of China from whence the Chinese of Califor
nia have mostly come I had been given ex
ceptional opportunities for observing and com
paring the Chinese who returned home from
California with those - who had never left
China, and as the result of my observations
I. was strongly In favor of the restriction laws
and of making them even more restrictive, be
cause of the demoralizing effect that emigra
tion had had upon the Chinese themselves.
Since that time I have studied conditions
earnestly and thoroughly and I â  seen tenden
cies amons these Chinese that fill my mind
with alarm for their own future welfare and
for the welfare of American youths who come
in contact with them.
Conditions of Life.
Practically all of the Chinese who come to
California are from a small region of one or
the eiehteen provinces of China. Most of them
are farmers' sons, unaccustomed- to city lue.
They leave their wives In China, where they
can support them for about $4 a month, mak
ing visits home every four or five years. .
There are at sresent about 1S.0C0 of these
men in San Francisco, huddled together within
a sracs comDoaed of a few blocks, separated
from their wives, with no home 'life and with
out the restraining influence of} women.
A condition of immorality has resulted only
paralleled by that which called down in old
times the judgment of God uaon Sodom and
Gomorrah, and the same perversions or
morality exist in Chinatown to-day.
Another evil calling for drastic measures Is
the importation of -women for immoral pur
poses. There are at present in Chinatown
hundreds of Chinese women who have been in
duced to come here to marry rich husband3
and who upon their arrival were sold into the
lowest form of human slavery. Since their
organization the Presbyterian and Methodist
rescue homes have, under great difficulties,,
rescued over nins hundred Chinese slave girls.
What must have bean the number who have
lived and died In bondasei
Under the instructions ot the Attorney Gen'
eral, the United States Attorney for the North
ern District 'of California, his associates, and
the Chinese Bureau at San Francisco, have
made every effort to cope with this evil and
have had the encouragement of the San Fran
cisco press, but the present laws have ren
dered nugatory many of their efforts by reason
of the fact that if through any fraudulent
means the owners of these girls can establish
their American nativity the law as it stands
to-day cannot compel these owners to release
There are a number of earnest â  Chinese
Christians and others in San Francisco, whose
morals are beyond question. I love these Chi
nese Christian brethren as I do- the Christians
of â  my own people and I do not feel ais
courased in the work of the Gospel among
them. - But knowing as I do these alarming
facts, I feel it my duty to call attention to
them. V v* ".'
Suggestions for Amendments.
Under the present law thousands of laborers
return to this country every year after a visit
to China. I believe condition' â  are such ana
the danger to our own youth so great that not
only Â«=hould the present exclusion laws be re
enacted, but made sy as to exclude all alien
Chinese laborers returning to thi3 country ex
cept these .who bring their wives, and that
there should be strict provisions requiring the
registration of such families and the deporta
tion of any who should for immoral purposes
abuse the privilege. â¢ â¢
I would respectfully suggest to you that
some such restrictions as_the following would
in my opinion very largely tend to exclude all
undesirable Chinese persons desiring to enter
this country and would also mitigate the evils
above complained of: â¢
Firstâ That all alien Chinese females in the-
United States bs registered annually. That
information as to the United States regarding
slavery, with directions as to where to obtain
relief If held In bondage, be printed on their
certificates In English and Chinese, and that
such Information and directions be read and
explained to the holder of such certificate by
the officer issulns it at the time of registra
tion, such certificate to be retained by the fe
male to whom it is Issued. That information
and directions similar to that contained in the
certificate be conspicuously posted In every
apartment occupied by Chinese females.
Spcondâ That any alien Chlnsse person who
shall be guilty of any crime against the mar
riage laws of the State or Territory in which
he shall reside shall be deported.
Thirdâ That any alien Chinese person who
shall engaee in any business or occupation
contrary to the laws of the United States, or
of the State â  or Territory In which he shall
carry on such business or occupation, shall be
"Fourthâ That any alien Chinese person who
shall be found present at any meeting of any
society or corporation where any business is
transacted contrary to the laws of the United
States, or of the State or Territory In which
such meeting Is held, shall be deported. \ ery

NAVY DEPARTMENT BILLS.

&-rr<HAT the Chinese are determined
THAT the Chinese are determined
to fight the renewal of the exclu
i sion act by the present Congress
11 is evinced by an editorial in the
Chinese dally paper, Chung Sal
Yat Po, published at 804 Sacramento
street. In an editorial published on No
vember 26 the details of the plan of cam
paign are outlined.
Four persons will compose the party.
They are Ng Poon Chew, the editor of the
paper and a Presbyterian minister; Low
Choy and Low Chee, sons of a. prominent
Chinese merchant and at present attend
ing school, arid Brewer, a singer and in
terpreter. The party has laid out an
elaborate plan of campaign. The article
in the Chinese paper, translated by Rev.
John Endicott Gardner, the Chinese in
spector and translator attached to the
Chinese Bureau, is as follows:
Going Together to Lecture.
The vexatious law of Geary's that has been
in operation in the United States for the ex
clusion of Chinese will expire in the coming
year. At present the labor unions ana the
newspapers in the western portion of the
â¢ United States are making continued exclusion
their chief theme; furthermore, fearing that
the merchants in the East migl-t regard the
â¢ exclusion lajv as inimical to trade, and that
consequently they would not consent to a re
enactment of the law upon its expiration, they
resort to sophistry in their arguments. claim-
Ing that we Chinese have no patriotism, that
in spite of exclusion Chinese will not purchase
one whit less of American goods, that from
the time the exclusion act went into effect the
trade that the United States has attained -from
Chir.a has been perceptibly and gradually in
creasing every day, hoping thus to inveigle
the Easterners into the position of not resist
ing the continuance of exclusion. \ Though
Minister "VVu and Consul General Ho migfc^
expend much lip and tongue energy or labor,
much with pen and ink in answering their ar-<
guments, the people in general and the schol
ars of those cities might say "These are offi
cials â one a Minister and the other a. Cousul â
and they are merely performing their duty in
their respective official positions; what else
can they do?" Even the best and most ex
haustive energies would thus be swept aside
with this one saying. We could no longer bear
looking upon these passing events ani do
nothing.
Thought Preacher the Best.
â We desired some one thoroughly versed In
English and capable of expressing himself to
travel widely in the East, lecturing every
where for the purpose of saying to the mer
chants of the different States and the people
of wealth that the exclusion act is exceedingly
inimical to trade in order that they might
take the words of Minister Wu and Consul
General Ho as statements of fact, but It was
ditneu't to find such a person and there was
no fountain from which the money was to
come. Subsequently we thought of the trans
lator on our own paper, Ng Poon Chew, v.-ho
has been a preacher for many years, a man
locked up to all along by Westerners, and
one who. because of those qualities, had been
repeatedly and earnestly invited to lecturt by
the people of the University of Southern Cali
fornia and at Stanford University and by tha
various associations at Alameda, Sacramento,
Oakland and this city, ! when they would In
variably listen T7ith rapt attention. This be
ing so, our paper decided to appoint Mr. Ng
to the position of lecturer. Still the matter
of expenses incidental to traveling through the
different States presented us with difficulties.
Will Utilize Churches. .-â â ;*
While planning about it the . project hap
pened to. reach the ears of the General Board
of the Presbyterian Church of; tiia city and
New York. The board signified its willingness
to help, writing also beforehand to the people
of the different cities asking them to lend
their churches for the lectures. The several
tens of thousands of notices printed In English
for circulation at the various cities the Pres
byterian church took hold of and distributed
besides setting forth the dates when certain
cities would be reached. In addition to this
there will be two brothers. Low Chee and
Low Choy,. and an American namedr Brewer,
who will go along to play and alng. Low
Chee and Low Choy are the highly intelligent
sons of Low Wan Shang of Fook Wo & Co. ,
dealers in Japanese wares of this city. They
are. students at one of the .colleges In this
city, but for the time being on leave of ab
sence in order to go along on the lecture tour.
As to the American named Brewer, he has
been for some time past teaching English at
the Chinese Presbyterian Church of this city.
."--â .: The Plans Proposed..
These three will go along and play and sing
as a means of enticing Americans to listen.
It is estimated that it will require several
thousand dollars to cover the traveling ex
penses and hotel fare for the- four peoplo, all
of which amount will be paid. by tie Ameri
can Presbyterian church. At every place they
arrive s0 they will set forth in gsneral terrrta
the benefit that will come from mutual inter
course between : the two nations,' using the
Boxer â  trouble of the past year merely as an
introduction.: in order that the hearers may
not be conscious of the fact that they have
come especially on accunt of the exclu3iori;act.
Later jen in course- of the lecture they "will
say that with the vexatious Chinese exclusion '.
act in force the Americans are not different^
from .the Boxers, as the Boxers claim to lo^4^
China, but as a matter, of tact Injured China.;
so the. exclusion act, though claimed to bene3t
the United States, as a matter of fact wLir
Injure the United States; that should tha
United States re-enact the exclusion act trado
can certainly not prosper; R.n<1 that furÂ»hÂ«*-
mqre since the United States desire* to -have
. ttle beurflt of China's trade she must abolish
the exclusion act in order to satisiy us
Chinese.
Have Letters of Introduction.
This is but a general outline as to the par
ticulars. Doubtless Mr. Ngr wiii be able to
deal with them very cleverly. We hope that
Mr. Ng will on this occasion move the hearts
of the Easterners so that as a result the ex
clusion act will be -abolished and our peoplo
will be so invigorated as not to be unworthy
of the project.
There are many prominent American citizens
as well as presidents of universities- who have
given Mr. Ng letters of recommendation In
order that upon arrival at Washington he may
be able to go before the high officials of the
different departments. A ' legislator of this
State named Kaan (phonetic imitation of some
English name.â Translator) and Consul General
Ho also gave hi' letters of recommendation
so that he may present himself to Minister
"Wu. Low Chee and the others have also let
ters of recommendation of the educational or

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Miss Ellen M.
Stone has at last been located. According
to a dispatch received by the State De
partment to-day from Eddy, Charge d'Af
faires in Constantinople, she is in the
â¢woods on the south side of the Gultepe

she is well.
The State Department has cabled in
structions to Eddy and to Dickinson to
renew their efforts to effect the woman's
liberation. The department does not pro
pose to place any credence in further ru
mors of Miss Stone's death. The officials
say the woman represents such a large
sum of money that it is unlikely that the
brigands will wantonlv slay her.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Dec. 4.â The re
cent silence of Miss Stone is attributed to
p.he urtusual heavy snow. An investiga
tion of the Elderuth Valley, where the
captives are reported to have been bur
ied, has nearly been completed, but fails
to show that Miss Stone and her compan

EMPTY HONOR
Coronation Court Has
Weighty Questions
to Settle. ?
Chief Larderer's [ Occupation
Like Othello's, Is No
More.
LONDON, Dec. 4.â The Court of Claims
which is dealiqg with the rights and priv
lliges relating to the coronation of
King Edward, met to-day in solemn state
in the council chamber of Whitehall to
adjudicate between the nobles who are
â¢wrangling for ancient but generally
empty and often ludicrous honors.
Sixty cases came up, the most promi
nent being the fight between the Duke of
Atholl, the Earl of Ancaster. the Mar
quis of Cholmondeley and Earl Carring
ton for the Lord Great Chamberlainship.
This was too weighty for the court,
which passed it on to the House of Lords.
Several other cases were referred to a
committee, but the Earl of Errol will be
permitted to walk in the coronation pro
cession as Lord High Constable of Scot
land and carry a silver baton tinned
with gold bearing his own arms at one
end and the King's at the other.
The claim for representation as Chief
Larderer was dismissed by the statement
that there will be no coronation banquet
and that hence there will be no Larderer.
Miss Beatrice Fellows, who desired to
perform the office of Herb-strewer, and
Sir Harrys Burrar.d, who claimed the
right to carry the King's bow and ar
rows, were informed that they would not
be wanted.
Th>e Bishops of Durham and Bath, it
was decided, have the right to support
the King while he is on the throne, mat
is to say. they will stand with their hands
on the back of the chair.

STEAMSHIP IS LONG OVEBDTJE
Pears That the Discovery Has Met
Disaster Off Alaska.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Dec. 4.â More
than a week overdue on a round trip
which usually takes five or six days, the
steamer Discovery, plying between
Juneau and Valdcz, Alaska, is believed
either to be fast in an ice jam or to have
met other disaster. The steamer City of
Seattle, arriving here this evening from
the north, brought the first news of the
supposed loss of the Discovery.
AVhen the Seattie left Juneau on her
wav to Vancouver the Discovery was
more than a week overdue, and the
steamer Elihu Thompson of Seattle had
been two days out in search of her. The
Thompson had come down from Valdez
on her vray to Seattie and called into
Juneau with the mails. She had neither
seen nor heard anything of the Discovery,
and the anxiety that had been previously
felt for the safety of the steamer in
creased until it was decided to charter
the Thompson and send her back over
the same route once more. The Thomp
son intended to go farther than Valdez
on her trip, and. returning toward
Juneau, leave Valdez for Seattle again
to-day, according to the special schedule
arranged.
V.'hile steamboat people in the north
are inclined to believe that the vessel has
come to grief, the ov.-ners at Juneau
think Ehe may have been caught in the
ice and will be held until spring or else
crushed between the floes. The steamer
is of about 200 tons, well built, and car
ried twenty persons, crew and passen
gers.
STEAMEB GOES ASHOEE.
SEATTLE, Dec. 4.â The steamer Clara
Brown, one of the largest stern-wheelers
on the Sound, was driven ashore at Al-Ki
Point last night at 7 o'clock during the
gale which raged all night. In trying to
round the Point on her usual trip to
Seattle from Tacoma. the steamer became
completely unmanageable and several
times was in imminent danger of foun
dering. She finally drove up on the beach
a half mile south of the Point. The pas
sengers jumped overboard and made their
way ashore through the surf. The beach,
fortunately, was sandy. The gale has
continued all day and the boat has been
badly smashed, but probably will be
saved, unless the g'ale becomes much
worse.
The Clara Brown, Captain Charles
Caldwell. left Tacoma early last evening
on her usual run to this city, knowing a
gale was coming, but not realizing what
its fury would be. It was blowing, mod
erately from the southeast on the Sound,
and this speeded the vessel on her course.
Not long after leaving Tacoma the wind
shifted to the southwest and soon came
up a lively gale that was not long in
whipping up the sea. The vessel passed
Point Robinson lighthouse and rounded
into a long straight stretch of more than
twelve miles to Al-Ki Point. The sea was
pounding on the shore and breaking into
surf â white and deep as a big snowbank
and the crew realized then that they
would have a spell of it when the time
came for rounding Al-Ki Point. .
Long before the steamer reached the
fury of the gale almost made it impossi
ble to keep the boat on her course and up
to her work.
The Brown draws about three and one
half to four feet of water, a much greater
depth than the average stern-wheel
steamer, and in this and her compara
tively low upper works lay the steamer's
comparative safety, from serious damage.
PATE OF THE HIGHLAND LIGHT.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 4.â Captain
Gillespie. of the b/Trk Highland Light,
which was abandoned and foundered off
the west coast of Vancouver Island, ar
rived here to-day. He says that when
the Highland Light left port she had
been leaking slightly, but not enough to
cause fear regarding her safety, as she
was well equipped with pumps. During
the gale the vessel strained jSO badly that,
although the pump3 were kept steadily In
operation day and night, It was Impossi
ble to keep ahead of the in-flow of water.
Three pumps constituted the vessel's
equipment for handling the water. She
depended principally on one rigged to a
windmill, but, early In the gale, this got
out of order through mismanagement on
the part of one of the officers and reli
ance had to be placed on the two smaller
pumps operated by donkey engines. The
crew behaved heroically. As the gale in
creased In fury the bark's decks were
continually swept by seas.
' On November 15 the weather cleared
sufficiently for Captain Gillespie to make
the first observation possible for several
days and he found that he was about 130
miles â west-northwest from Cape - Flat
tery. It was while the bark was heading
for the shore of the west coast of Van
couver Island on November 16 that a
small schooner was sighted. Signals of
distress were set aboard the Highland
Light and were seen by the other vessel,
â¢which proved the Arilla of Seattle. About
11 o'clock on the morning of November 16
the schooner bore dyown on the Highland
Light, and she hove to under her lee at
3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Up to the time of sighting the Arilla it
was not known to the crew of the High
land that Capaln Gillespie Intended ,to
abandon the vessel and when he gave
the order to clear away the boat a wild
rush took place, but no one was hurt.
Nothing was saved except a few instru
ments brought off by Captain Gillespie.
The crew did not have time to save even
their blankets. â¢ â¢ , .
When the bark was abandoned there
was eight feet of water In the after pump
well and It was steadily gaining depth at
the rate of one foot per hour. Ths
Bchooner Arilla did not stand by to wit
ness the final lunge, but, when last seen,
the starboard rail of the Highland Light
was already beneath the waves and she
was rapidly settling.

CONSORT OF HOLLAND'S QUEEN
A VICTOR IN HIS TWO DUELS
flembersof the Court Resent Prince Henry's Insult to
Queen Wilhelmina at a Dinner.
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 4.â In spite of
official denials, â¢ investigations
show there is substantial founda
tion for the story of a duel being
fought between Prince Henry of
The Netherlands, husband of Queen Wil
helmina, and Major Van Tets, the Queen's
aid de camp.
It appears that at a dinner at Het Loo
her Majesty was hurt by some Inattention
upon the Prince's part and spoke to him
sharply. Prince Henry retorted offensive
ly, whereupon Major Van 1 eta made a re
mark regarding the impropriety of the
Prince Consort's conduct.
A auarrel followed between the aid de
camp and the Prince, who had been drink-
Ing freely, and a duel, with swords was
fought after dinner. Van Tets was
wounded. He has 1 since been removed to
Utrecht to be operated upon.
The same incident gave rise to another
duel between Prince Henry and another
member of the court. The latter was
slightly wounded.
WOULDN'T PAY DEBTS
C?.us8 of the Estrangement Between
Wilhelmina and Prince Henry.
LONDON, Dec. 5.â The matrimonial
quarrel between Queen WHhelmina
and Prince Henry, her husband,
excites great interest here. The
history of the affair, as gath
ered from the various continental
newspapers, charges Prince Henry with
misconduct and neglect, and repeats ru
mors of his deep drinking and heavy
gambling debts, which Queen Wilhelmina
declined to pay.
Another point of disagreement between
the pair was the Prince's unconcealed
antipathy to Holland and ungovernable
passion for hunting, which resulted in
his long absences in Germany. It is said

Special Dispatch to The Call,
REDDING, Dec. 4.â Dr. C. W. Bryant, a

Dry Creek at Bella Vista last night. Dr.
Bryant had been to â¢ the home of - Isaac
Melton, six miles above Bella Vista, to at
tend a sick person. It was dark and rain
fell In torrents when he began his home

did horses.
Arriving at Dry Creek he found that
stream overrunning its banks and 'his
horses could not be urged to ford it. He
then drove down the stream to the ford
at Bella Vista, where he g attempted to
cross. As he reached the center the cur
rent upset the buggy, hurling the doctor
into the water. He grasped his medicine
chest, and, with the handle of it In his
teeth, swam to the bank. The horses and
buggy were carried downstream 200 yards.
Both animals â were ' drowned 'and the
buggy was wrecked.
J. M. Bassett, while fording Olney
Creek, was carried 100 yard? down
stream, but managed to reach the bank
with his horses.
George Bayha, vice president of the
North California Investment Company,
was caught between two creeks and de

In regard to % the quarrel at the dinner
at Het Loo and the resultant duels, an
other rumor represents Major Van Teta
as having received a violent kick In the
stomach, which caused him severe In
.ternal injuries, and it is supposed that
the fear that his death might lead to
revelations of the real reason for some
thing of the truth being permitted to leak
out after the matter was officially denied.
The latest news, however, says that Ma
jor Van Tets is progressing favorably
and it is said the Queen mother has been
able to effect something like a reconcili
ation between the Queen and her hus
band.
. Prince Henry has a record of several
duels in his student days. He has al
ways been exceedingly unpopular in Hol
land,' where, since 1870, there have been
morbid fears of annexation schemes on
the' part of Germany, and on this ac-
count the friends of Prince Henry de
clare he never has had fair play.
BURRO FEASTS
ON GREENBACKS
Chews Up the Roll of
a Shasta County
: Miner.
Speclal Dispatch to Toe Call.
REDDING, Dec. 4.â John M. Crume, son
of Jesse Crume of Hatchet Creek Moun
tain fame, has spent the summer In min
ing on Coffee Creek. He decided to return
to Redding by a roundabout route and
came over the road by the Government
hatchery at Baird, driving his two loaded
burros ahead of him. There he camped
for the night. The donkeys were relieved
of their load and fell to browsing on
blackberry vines and discarded fish nets.
Crume lay down with his carpet satchel
under his head. It served as a pillow, but
the primary reason the owner kept his
head upon it was to guard the chief item
of its contents, a roll of greenbacks.
The blackberry vines and net cords
must haVe lacked flavor, for during the
night one of the little burrofe pulled the
satchel from under her master's head, con
trived,to get it open and finished her
night-time repast. In the morning Crume
awoke with a start, realizing that the pre
cious bag â was gone. He found it some
yards away and scattered about were
green crumbs from the meal.
The burro had seized the roll of bills
at the center and chewed the succulent
fiber of the greenbacks. The ends had
dropped to the ground. Crume pried open
the burro's mouth and picked some more
specks : of value "from her teeth. The
scraps were carefully collected. The
ruined greenbacks consisted of one $30,
two $20, one $10, three $5 and two $1 bills,
totaling $117.
. It is. believed the pieces can be segre
gated by an expert under a glass and At
torney F. P. Primm sent the wadded
fibers to the Treasury Department in
Washington with an explanation to see if
some of the bills at least cannot be re
placed. . â  .'

CHINESE TONG
SUES FOR PIPE
Seeks to Recover Dis
: penser of Happy
Dreams.
Claims the Loss of Sacred
Relic Has Resulted in
Misfortune.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 4.â A historical opium
pipe, valued at $250, is the basis of a re
plevin suit filed in Justice Rosenthal's
court. Captain of Police Perry H. New
berry is the defendant, and the suit is
brought for the Boo Ong Tong, a Chinese
highbinder society, by Leon Poon, its
president. The pipe disappeared from
the society's possession just after a
murder in Chinatown about two years
ago and later was presented to the police
captain. At the t time of the murder the
pine was being smoked by Ah Nim, who
was killed by a buhet lired through a
window, and it is said thac blood was
shed merely to obtain possession of this
purveyor ox dreams.
Ever since tne pipe disappeared a num
ber of attempts nave been made to ob
tain possession of it. Once lour Chinese
auempted to take it by force from the
dewberry home, and on two other oc
casions the family washman stole it, but
was captured before he got out of the
door. Now the courts have been resort
ed to to get possession of it.
The pipe is a sacred relic, and, accord
ing to the Chinese, has been in the pos
session of some Boo Ong Tong for sev
eral centuries. In the early iorties the
pipe was brought to California and later
found its way to San Jose. It is one of
the most elaborate smoking articles of
the kind ever seen in the State. The bowl
is a knot of mahogany about the size of
a man's two fists, the knobs of the knot
being * gold-mounted. A rare piece of
bamboo, mounted with gold rings and
containing a fine amber mouthpiece, js
the stem. Its place is in the society
house, where the officers of the tong are
allowed to smoke it. During the past
two years the Boo Ong Tong has been
having bad luck, and the members at
tribute this to the disappearance of the
pipe.
Captain Newberry has been offered $100
for the return of the pipe, but he has
refused to sell. The society does not
claim that he obtained possession of it
by other than fair means, but for the
welfare of the tong and its members the
Boo Ongs want the pipe returned. New
berry, who prizes it as a curio, will fight
the suit.
MISSING BARGE ASHORE.
Only One Man of the Wheeler's Crew

STANFORD TO PLAY THE VICTORIOUS MICHIGAN ELEVEN
TEAMS MEET
AT PASADENA
New YearV Day Chosen
as the Date of
Contest.
Football Game -a, Feature
of the Tournament
of Roses.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 4.-
The. cardinal football eleven will meet
the victorious University of Michigan
football team in a game to be played at
Pasadena en New Year's day. This was
decided at a meeting of the football men
called by Captain Fisher this afternoon
to coneider the proposal of James R.
Wagner, president of the Pasadena Tour
nament of Roses Association.
The University of Michigan eleven has
not betn scored against this season, al
though it has played nearly every tealm
in the middle West. Its largest score was
12S to 0 and the smallest 23 to 0. The
eleven has been perfected under the
coaching of Yost, who coached the Stan
ford team to victory last year. Among
the Michigan players is "Big" Gregory,
â who played center on the cardinal sec
ond eleven last. season, not being eligible
to the varsity.
Captain Fisher has issued a call for
varsity and second eleven men to appear
for practice to-morrow. The practice un
til college closes on December 20 will be
confined to the building up and perfecting
of team work. From then until the play
ers leave for Pasadena daily scrimmages
will occur between the varsity and the
second eleven.
Captain Fisher expects to take twenty
two men to Pasadena, thus including a
number of second eleven players as well
as the varsity team and substitutes.
Most of the men will have a chance to
go against the Michigan aggregation, as
Stanford intends to make as good a
showing as possible against the middle
West champions. ';
President Wagner of the Roses Asso
ciation has also secured the appearance
of the Stanford Glee and Mandolin Clubs
in Pasadena New Tear's night and ex
pects the double attraction of football
game and concert will draw an immense
crowd to the city. â¢
Olympics' Honolulu Trip.
Advices from Honolulu by the last
steamer seem to assure the trip of the
Olympic Club football team to Hawaii.
One thousand dollars had already been
raised to defray the expenses of the fif
teen men who would be taken from here.
There are four regularly organized foot
ball elevens in the islands. These are
made up of a college team, two athletic
club teams and one of natives.
Manager 1. T. Muma of the Olympic
team has strong hopes that the trip will
be made. The team would leave here on
the 15th inst. There are two steamers due
between the present time and that date.
On either of these may be the necessary
transportation.
Should this trip be abandoned Manager
"Pete" Smith of the Reliance Club is anx
ious for a return game under better
weather conditions than marked the
Thanksgiving day contest.

J&mes Whitneld of Kansas City Suc
ceeds T. J. Hickey, the Latter
Resigning With G. Tebeau.

ern League has decided to retain its or
ganization practically as it was last year.

later on, but it is doubtfuL The meeting
cf magnates was called at the instance of
"\V. T. Van Brunt of this city and of
Thomas F. Burns of Colorado Springs,
the owners of the franchises of these
towns.
The action of President Thomas J.
Hickey in forming the American Associa
tion, taking in some of the cities of the
"Western League, was calculated to ruin
the league. Van Brunt, who was left out
in the new arrangements, began a vig
orous correspondence with the magnates
at other points, with the result that the
meeting to-day ratified the old organiza
tion and accepted the resignations of
President Hickey, George Tebeau of Kan
sas City and George Lennon of St. Paul.
Tebeau endeavored to secure the ratifica
tion of the transfer of the Denver fran
chise by Packard to himself, but failed.
He is out of the Western League entirely,
according to the statements of the mag
nates to-night. James H. Manning -was
granted the Kansas City franchise. The
Denver franchise will go to some person
not yet named. It is undecided who will
get St. Paul, but it may be Lennon will
be taken back into the league, although
there is some objection. James Whitfieid
of Kansas City was elected president, suc
ceeding Hickey.
At to-night's session of the Western
League it was emphasized that clubs
would be maintained in all cities of the
league. The National and Western asso
ciations' presidents were notified that all
they heretofore held Is still claimed. The
next meeting will be held at Kansas City
on the second Tuesday in January.

aging Director Present.
LONDON, Dec. 4. â The annual meeting
of the British Chartered South
Africa Company was held here to-day,
under the presidency of the Duke of
Abercorn, who read a telegram from
Cecil Rhodes, managing director of the
company, regretting his absence, but
saying he was now improved in health.
This caused cries of, "Why is not he
here?"
The Duke of Abercorn said the
Rhodesian gold output reached high wa
ter mark in November, and he believed,
as they would soo,n be able to supply
their own coal, and with improvements
in railroad facilities, that Rhodesia would
compare favorably with any gold country
in the world. He also announced that
the Imperial Government had allowed the'
company to reduce the excessive police
force it had hitherto been compelled to
maintain, thereby obviating one of the
chief causes of this year's deficit of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1901.
WYOMING STRIKES HIS GOING
AND TRAMPS IN AT GOOD ODDS
Greyf eld Beats the English Horse, Royal Flush===Josie
Q Outsprints a Speedy Field.
FINALLY, when he was deserted
by the majority of his friends,
who found themselves as light
as an unloaded freight car, Gay-
Ian Brown's old horse" Wyoming
won a race at Oakland yesterday. He
was mixed up with a whole lot of speed
In. the last event on the card,, and
with Birkenruth on his expansive back
returned with the coin at odds of 6 and
7 to 1. Mocorito closed favorite over
Herculean, but does not seem possessed
of her former speed, showing to no par
ticular advantage. Educate left the ban
ner on a skyrocket breakaway, and then
could not last out. Birkenruth with
Wyoming made one of his short turns
into the stretch and, quickly taking the
front position, beat Herculean out two
lengths. Only a few of those who in
dulge in the practice. of "running a horse
down" bet on the winner.
While, the day was clear and pleasant
the track was very sloppy, giving horses
with speed the advantage. Under such
uncertain conditions three favorites had
their numbers flashed first. Under the
improved climatic conditions the attend
ance showed a marked increase over the
preceding day.
Thinking Evander scarcely up to a
bruising race Walter Jennings let his
niaiden 2-year-old run loose in the open
ing scramble. After receding from 6 to 5
to 5 in the books the 2 1 year-old downed
Budd Wade a length, owing chiefly to
Winnie O'Connor's persuasive saddle tac
tics. Major Bird, the favorite, was early
cut off and never after took a hand in the
game.
Once again it looked as if Grayfeld had
had dropped into a soft spot, and this
time Bob Smith's chestnut delivered the
merchandise. It was generally supposed
that Forkford, piloted by Johnny Woods,
was going to cut some figure, and the
Baldwin entry closed nearly an equal
favorite with Grayfeld. Forkford dis
played* a rousing burst of speed for a
second, and then completely disappeared.
After Royal Flush, the Britisher, became
afflicted with the sulks in the stretch,
Birkenruth on Grayfeld blew in at
leisure. â¢
Rollick, equal favorite in' the ring with
Ned Dcnnid, captured the Futurity course
sprint after a hard drive- with Abba L, a
100 to 1 shot. The latter made all the
running and only at the paddock did she
begin flashing distress signals. Alzura,
probably short a race, finished in the
show.
Fresh and overflowing with speed after
hei rest, Josie G, the fast daughter of
Bloomsbury, defeated St. Sever and Dr.
Scharff for the fourth purse. Rosewar
came in for heavy backing at 6 to 5. and
the filly made a most disappointing show
ing, never -getting up with the leaders.
Josie G was always in front and led St.
Sever past, the wire a couple of lengths.
Ceesar Young's Eonic. the even money
choice for the mile selling run, expe
rienced some poor racing, luck at the
start, but ran gamely, and was returned
the winr.c--. Lee Jackson piloted the filly
and was dly bumped at the first turn,
besides gtiting away from the post in a
tangled uo condition. All this gave J.
Daly, on Galanthus, an opportunity to
open up a gap of daylight over his field.
However, he did not get far away, and
when challenged In the stretch^ by the
favorite swerved in toward the rail and
lost by a length. Bedeck finished only a
lair third.
Track -Notes.
Sixteen books laid odds yesterday. Bar
ney Schreiber cut in, v.hile Joe Harlan
concluded to "buck 'em" from the ground
for a few days.
f Birkenruth was the only rider to pilot
two winners.
Barney Schreiber's Budd " Wade was
tipped about to win the maiden event.
O'Connor gave Royal Flush such a
shaking up that the English horse- acted
in the stretch as if he wanted to run out
the gap.
Hoar rode Abba L. which came within
an ace gf beating Rollick at odds of 100
to 1. The mare ran some remarkably fast
races in Montana this summer at the
shorter sprinting distances. â¢
But for being bumped by Alzura, Ned
Dennis might have landed the third
purse, y
St. Sever acted sore when he was
brought to the paddock, which caused his
odds to recede from 3 to 5 to 1.

Surprising Feature of
Eastern Bank Teller's
Theft.
BALLSTON, N. Y.,, Dec. 4.âBank.Ex
aminer Graham was busy all day exam
ining bank certificates presented to the
bank for verification. To-day there were
several developments increasing the de
fault in interest-bearing certificates or
confirming Vice President
suspicions therein. Several * certificates
were presented to-day that are marked
on Teller Fitcham's books as paid and the
account closed. ' *
The bank officials still assert that the
bank can reopen next week on a sound
basis, admitting that their $116,000 surplus
is wholly wiped out by Fitcham's embez
zlements. When the doors closed Monday
night and. Examiner Graham took charge
the bank's assets were $786,000, exclusive
of $100,000 capital; liabilities,- $620,000. .
Fitcham's peculations are now known
to have extended back twenty years. His
individual deposit ledger balanced to a
cent when he closed, it Saturday noon.
Fitcham remains at home under a strong
guard and was too ill to be arraigned this
afternoon. He said the estimates of the
bank's loss were exaggerated and that he
had not taken more than half the sum
mentioned. He said he was not a stock
gambler, but that his trouble was due to
family ! extravagance, j his expenditures
having been for years in excess of his
salary. ' " â â¢â¢â¢â¢'. ' -â

signal immediately passing the station
signal at Seneca, according to the com
pany's rules. Firema*h Bastien was found
negligent in falling to remind the engi
neer of order No. 82, when the engineer
failed to give the proper signal and slow
up at Seneca. Brakeman A. W. Dlttman

STRONG HOUNDS
ARE IN DEMUD
Hares Now Running Are
Too Much for the
< Sprinters.
Two Stakes to Be Run at
Union Coursing Park
. This Week.
Eighty-eight greyhounds will be in the
running on Saturday and Sunday at
Union Coursing Park. An open stake of
seventy-two dogs will be run down once
on Saturday and will be concluded on
Sunday. A special stake of sixteen dogs
will be run in its entirety on Sunday. The
hares are surprising the coursing men by
taking the fleet dogs around the field in
courses of two minutes and over. Usual
ly at this time of the year, when feed is
plentiful, the courses are short. The
greyhound which can stay the route Is
still in demand over the sprinter. The

FEDERATION OF LABOR
READY FOR ITS' SESSION
Exclusion of Chinese Will Form On<Â»
of the Chief Questions
Considered.
- SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 4.â To-night the
hotel corridors are crowded with dele
gates from all over 'the United States and
Canada campaigning for and against the
various measures that are scheduled to
come up in the big convention of the
American Federation of Labor, which will
be opened here to-morrow. The Pacific

tion favoring the re-enactment of the Chi
nese exclusion laws, with amendments to
make its provisions apply to all Mongol
ians and its operation unlimited as to
years.
Delegates from the shipbuilding trades
are making a vigorous campaign for a
demand from the federation that the Gov

out the contracts to private parties who
pay less wages and exact more labor than
does the Government.
The resolutions submitted for the con
vention's consideration number nineteen
in all. In addition to several on adher
ence to strict trade autonomy and one
on Chinese exclusion, they declare for the
creating of a defense fund by levying a
10-cent per capita tax; against tenement
and home work by tailors: against the
"progressive cigarette-makers'" independ
ent label; for boycott on the tobacco and
bakery trusts and other alleged unfair in
stitutions; for an eight-hour day for post
offlce clerks; for obligating of members;
to demand the union label on everything
manufactured by union hands; against
any local body declaring a boycott until
the central body approves of it; for the
proportional preferential ballot system;
for the appointment of a. committee to In
duce the masons and bricklayers to affil
iate; for a law making it a capital crime
to attempt to kill the President of the
United States, Vice President or any mem
ber of the Cabinet; establishment of a

RAILWAY MEN
THLK OF RITES
Representatives of Many
Roads Hold a Con-
Increase of th9 Car Famine
Prevents a Serious
Problem.
NEW YORK. Dec. 4.â Keprcsent^A'i
of practically every railroad running/:;!^:
of Chicago, with the exception of the
Great Northern, held a meeting to-day in
this city. The business of the session was
unusually brief, entirely routine, and had
to do chiefly with the problem of main
taining freight and passenger rates
through the vast country traversed by
these roads.
Perhaps the most serious problem which
presented itself to the railroad men wan
the increasing car famine which at this
time taxes the capacity of all the more
important railroads. No conclusion was
reached on this point, but it was sug
gested that It might be necessary to make
a per diem charge, instead of a mileage
charge for the use of cars.
Regarding the rate situation, freight
and passenger reports submitted indicated
that these were in a fairly satisfactory
condition. There were no complaints of
rate cutting In some quarters
there was a disposition to attach signifi
cance to the absence of the Great North
ern representative. It was explained,
however, that the affairs of Hill's road
would be amply subserved by others pres
ent at the meeting. No representative of
the Interstate Commerce Commission at
tended the meeting for the reason that no
business bearing on the affairs of this
body was transacted.
In the absence of Chairman E. T. Jef
fery of the Denver and Rio Grande road,
who is now making a tour of the South
west with George J. Gould, the presiding
officer was Joseph Ramsay Jr. of the Wa
bash road. After the meeting Rasr*%y
said that the real business of the co*!lr>
er.ce was transacted at the monthly meet
ings held In Chicago and that a quarterly
meeting was held in this city to give op
portunity for conferences with the presi
dents and directors, but, as a matter of
fact, no meeting had been held here for
a year, and this meeting was somewha:
of a disappointment, owing to the fact
that so few of the presidents and direc
tors were able to be present. Sessions
were held in" the morning and afternoon
and the meeting adjourned shortly be
fore 5 o'clock to meet in Chicago Decem
ber 20.
I "When asked whether there had been
any discussion as to possible interference
by the Western Governors or the Inter
state Commerce Commission with the
Northern Securities Company, Ramsay
said that the conference had nothing to
do with such matters and that the ques
tion had not been touched on. as it was
purely and solely a rate conference.
BANKEKS MTJST TELL
ALL ABOUT CAPITAL
Internal Revenue Commissioner Ben
ders an Important Decision Re
garding Taxable Property.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 4.-The
Commissioner, of Internal Revenue has
rendered a decision In which he holdav
that bankers must return for taxation
capital, surplus, undivided profits and
borrowed money used in the business oÂ£
banking. The Commissioner holds that
capital is taxable whether Invested, as in
the case of the United States bonds, or
the bank building, or tire circulating, as
In the case of money, including money
borrowed; also surplus, including undi
vided profits.
"In providing that surplus shall be in
cluded as capital," the decision says, "it
is obviously the purpose of the law to
have the tax imposed apply to all money
used or employed by banks as capital in
carrying on their business. Money bor
rowed by banks and used as capital is
held to be taxable, and it is clearly no
less liable to tax because of the fact that
it is borrowed by a bank from Its own un
divided profits.
"The fact that surplus so used consists
wholly or in part of undivided profits, or
that such undivided profits have or have
not been formally set apart from such,
seems wholly immaterial, so far as tha
purpose of the act is concerned. It is the
use and not the authority to use that
brings such profits within the taxing pro
visions of the act."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Catarrh has become such a common
disease that a person entirely free from
this disgusting complaint is seldom met
with. It is customary to speak of Catarrh
as nothing more serious than a bad cold,
a simple inflammation of the nose and
throat. It is, in fact, a complicated and
very dangerous disease ; if not at first, it
very soon becomes so.
The blood is quickly contaminated by
the foul secretions, and the poison through
the general circulation is carried to all
parts of the system.
Salves, washes and sprays are unsatis-
factory and disappointing, because they do
not reach the seat of the trouble. S. S.gfr
does. It cleanses the blood of the poisBt* Â£
and eliminates from the system all catar-
rhal secretions, and thus cures thoroughly
and permanently the worst cases.
Mr. T. A. Williams, a leading dry-good* meiw
chant of Spartanburg. S. C. writes; " For years

Isthmian Canal Cbmmis
sion Sends Report to
Congress.
Eight Years and Nearly Two
Hundred Millions
Needed.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The report of
the Isthmian Canal. Commission was sent
to Congress to-day. The commission, as
anticipated several weeks ago, favors the
Nicaragua route and makes an estimate
-of 1189 .864,062 as the total cost of construc
tion of the canal through Nicaragua. The
' eÂ£tJ^Vt d cost of tne p anama route Is
S141.23S.35S, but, the report says, it would
cost 5109,141,000 to obtain the Panama con
cersion. The commission values the work
done at $19,000,000.
* Th .l, re Port says the Panama route is
feasible as a sea level canal, while the
>icarasrua route must be by locks, but
w, e icar agua will furnish an inexhaus
tible supply of water for the canal. The
Ivicaragua route has no natural harbora
at either end, but satisfactory harbors
pay be constructed. Harbors already ex
ist at each end of the Panama route, but
considerable work must be done at -the
entrance of the harbor on the Atlantic
side.
With adequate force and plant the com
mission estimates that the Nicaragua ca
ral can be completed In six years, exclu-
Eive of two years for prejjaration. Ten
years is estimated to complete the Pana
ma canal. The total length of the,Nicara
gua route is 1S3.66 miles and the Panama
route 4SJ.09 miles. The estimated cost of
operating- and maintaining the Nicaragua
canal annually is $1,350,000 greater than
that of the Panama canal.
The estimated time for a deep draught
vessel to pass through the Panama canal
Is twelve hours and through Nicaragua
canal thirty-three hours. The Nicaragua
route, the report says. Is more advanta
geous for commerce, save that originat
ing on the west coast of South America.
For the Gulf ports the advantage is two
days and for most of the ports on the
Atlantic and Pacific one day. The Nica-
raf,ua route is said to be better for sall
ying vessels on account of favoring winds.
I Hygienic conditions also favor Nicaragua.
The commission says the United States
Ehould acquire control of a strip of terri
tory ten mf.es wide from sea to sea
through which to build the canal. The
consent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica
must be obtained to construct the canal,
but the report says this can easily be se
cured. The concessions granted by the
Colombian Government to the Panama
Canal Company have many years to run
and new concessions cannot be granted
the United States. The report concludes
as follows:
After considering all the facts developed by
the investigations made by the commission, thÂ«
actual condition as it now stands, and having
considered the terms offered by the new Pan
ama company, this commission is of the opinion
that the most practical -and feasible route tor
a canal, to be under the control, management
and ownership of the United States, is that
known as the Nicaragua route.
George S. Morrison, a 'member of the
commission, submits a minority report
favoring the Panama route. He says the
estimates for the Nicaraguan canal do
not make sufficient provisions for un
known conditions and contingencies. He
closes by saying:
The Panama route has advantages over the
JJicaragua route in cost of construction. In coat
of operation and In convenience when done,
â¢while its local use Is less likely to lead to local
International complications. If the United
States Government is to build an isthmian
canal, the Panama route is the best.
Opium Dealer Heavily Fined.
Tung Suey, SS Spofford alley, -was con
victed by Judge Cabaniss yesterday on

physician's prescription and was sen
tenced to pay a fine of $100. He -was

Chinatown squad in the act of selling: the
drug.
Tonnage Tax From. Philippines.
E. T. Chamberlain, National Commis
sioner of Navigation, has authorized a
change in the name of the steamship
Simon J. llurphy to that of Melville Dol
lar. The Commissioner has also informed
Customs Collector Stratton that taxes will
not be levied hereafter on vessels leaving
directly from the Philippines.

HANCOCK ARRIVES IN PORT
AFTER A VARIED EXPERIENCE
Goes Ashore While on Way to Assist Transport Warren,
â A but Gets Off Without Assistance. /
UNITED STATES TRANSPORT HANCOCK, WHICH WENT ASHORE IN THE INLAND SEA, THREE . MILES
FROM MO JI, WHILE ON HER WAT TO PICK UP THE CREW OF THE WRECKED TRANSPORT WARREN.
SHE WAS FLOATED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE.
THE United States army transport
Hancock arrived from the Philip
pines via Japanese ports yester
day. When she left Manila she
had only seventeen cabin and
four steerage passengers aboard. At
Nagasaki, however, she received Instruc
tions to proceed to Kobe and there take
the passengers of the Warren. The lat
ter vessel had been ashore in the Semon
oseKi Straits and had put into Kobe in
distress. /
When the Hancock was ) within five
miles of the place where the' Warren
struck she was run ashore by an ignor
ant pilot. " She was then within three
miles of Moji, and Captain Struve at
once sent there for assistance. In the
meantime the German gunboat Tiger
showed up and In answer to a distress
signal put a hawser aboard the Hancock.
Before she could begin towing, however,
the tide fell and it came on to blow so
she threw off the towing line and pro
ceeded on her way. Soon after this
lighters came out from Moji and on them
over 5<X> tons of pig iron ballast and coal
from the bunkers was loaded. At high
water the engines were backed at full
speed and the big transport slipped into
deep water.
"We were twenty-seven, hours on the
beach," said one of the officers yester
day, _"but the vessel was not damaged.
Divers were sent down as soon as we
reached Kobe and they reported the hull
intact. The pumps showed no sign of
water in the hold, so the captain decided
to proceed to .San Francisco. The sol
diers and sailors on the Warren were
transferred to our vessel ' and- another
start was made.
"When we got our orders at Nagasaki
to proceed to Kobe a pilot was put aboard
who had never handled a big ship in his
life. Captain Struve objected, but had to
take him nevertheless. The captain
handled the ship until the morning: of
November 15, when he anchored off
Rokurn Island. Then the pilot took
charge, and when we were abreast of
Manito beacon Captain Struve told him
THE SAN FJRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1901.
he was not steering a true course. The
pilot vowed he was and said he knew his
ousiness. Just then the man heaving the
lead yelled five fathoms and Captain
Struve at once ordered the vessel's en
gines reversed and gavÂ» the signal full
speed astern. I don't think the Hancock
was making more than three knots an
hour when she struck, but nevertheless
the impact was very heavy. We struck
a sandy beach and stayed there a day
and a night. We finally got off after dis
charging some coal and pig iron. There
was no confusion, no one was hurt and
the ship is still as sound as a dollar. ! I
hear we are ordered out' again on the
12th inst., so the Government must be
satisfied."
The Hancock brought up the following

To Regulate Gasoline Launches.
, The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and took up the ques-
tlon of gasoline launches and collisions
on the bay. After considerable discussion
the board decided that all launches using
the State wharves must be" provided with
at least one life preserver and seventy
flve feet of 3-inch rope.' This rule will not
affect the Peterson fleet, as. his launches
have always carried four or five life pre
servers and far more than? the requisite
quantity of rope. â¢ â¢ â  . : â  â  - ,

but had to buck head winds all the way to
San Francisco. â¢ -
The big British tramp steamship Arab
is nearly ready for sea again. She is- now
on the drydock and some time next week
will either sail for Manila for Uncle Sam
or to England with a cargo of wheat.

Programme.
Noted Statesmen Discuss
the Matter With the
XT I CDlUCllUf
, . WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4â Setre
tary Root Is taking counsel with some of
the Republican party leaders In the pre
paration of a programme to meet the de
cisions of the Supreme- Court last Monday
In the insular cases. It Is said that the
present purpose is to ask Congress to leg
islate Immediately to define with precision
the status of the Philippines from a reve
nue point of view.
While neither of the cases decided Mon
day, the Pepke "fourteen diamond rings"
case, nor the Dooley.case, affirmed or de-^
nled the. right of the Philippine authori
ties-to collect duties on goods entering
Manila from -the. United States, the offi
cials of the War Department in the ab
sence of legislation intend to continue the
collection of the duties at the present rate
at Manila. :
Amount of tlie Duties.
The financial officials of the department
who have looked Into the trade figures
for the past three years find that the sum
of $1,900,000 represents about the total of
the duties : collected from Spaniards on
goods arrived at- Manila which might
have to be refunded in the event that it
should ultimately be held that the collec
tion of duties on American goods there
was illegal: The Spaniards would secure
like liquidation under the terms of the
peace treaty guaranteeing them equal
rights with American merchants In tho
Philippines.
President Roosevelt to-day entertained
a distinguished company at lunch. Among
the guests were Mayor-elect Seth Low of
New York,' Senators Depew, Platt and
Frye. Secretaries Root and Hay, Attor
ney General Knox, Embassador Choate,
Representative Llttauer of New York and
Mr. Cortelyou. The decision of the Su
preme Court in the Philippine cases was
discussed and the conclusion reached to
have a bill -introduced at once in Con
gress to correct the situation at San
Francisco by levying a duty on goods
coming from the Philippines and, if nec
essary, to further legalize the present
duty on goods entering the Philippines.
Measure From Lodge.
Senator Lodge to-day introduced a bill
to provide revenues for the Philippine
Islands. It provides that the tariff passed
by the Philippine Commission September
17, 1901, and approved by the Secretary of
"War, shall remain in full force and ef
fect. This covers goods going into the
islands.
The second section of the bill provides
for levying the same duty and tariff on
goods coming into the United States from
the Philippine Islands that are now col
lected from foreign countries.
Section three provides that until other
wise ordered statutory laws of the "United
States shall not be in force in the Phil
ippines except as ordered by the Philip
pine Commission.
Section four provides that all duties
collected In the Philippine Islands shall
be paid into the Philippine Treasury.

FATHER FOUND STARVING -

Officers of Charitable Society Dis
cover Touching Example of
' Parental Affection. '
A sad case of destitution and a touch-
Ing example of parental affection was dis
covered at the home of Albert Rosa, 13
Hawthorn street, yesterday by the offi
cers of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.
A little 10-year-old boy has for -weeks
been lying helpless, slowly passing away
with consumption, and the father has
spent every available penny of hia earn
ings in a vain endeavor to prolong his
child's life, meanwhile depriving himself,
of everything but enough food to keep
body and soul together. When the oftt
cers of the charity arrived they could not
induce the man to leave his boy's bedside,
although chilled and exhausted as a re
sult of hl3 deprivations. The neighbors
stated that Ross had not left the bedsldo
for a moment for days, except when it
was necessary to buy food for the dying
lad.
The matter was reported to the proper
authorities and something will be done to
alleviate the sufferings of the two unfor
tunates. '..:â 'â

MARKETING FRUIT.
DEBATES at the Fruit-growers' Convention
now in session in this city furnish another
proof that the fruit industries of California
have reached that point in their development where
the marketing of the crop becomes the chief issue
before the producer. There are of course many
things yet to be discussed and learned as to the best
means of managing orchards, selecting varieties of
fruit for different localities, destroying fruit pests and
increasing production, but the main effort at present
is directed toward obtaining better markets or
cheaper and prompter access to existing markets.
It is not strange that it should be so. Compared
with the fruit industries of other States those of
California are voting, but such has been the rapidity
of their development that they surpass those of any
other State. In a paper read at the first day of the
convention it was pointed out that shipments of Cali
fornia fruits to the East have increased from 16,000
carloads in 1890 to 66,000 carloads in 1900. So huge
an increase in the output in so short a time naturally
gluts the existing channels of the trade. The mer
chants of the country who handle the fruit have not
been able to keep up with the increase in the quan
tity offered them to handle, and consequently the
producers suffer for a lack of adequate markets.
A similar condition has prevailed at times in other
lines of industry. In fact, the increase of produc
tiveness in nearly all lines of American industry has
made such experiences common. At the present time
the railroads themselves "have been caught napping
and find themselves lacking in facilities for handling
the traffic offered them. Reports have come from
manufacturing centers of establishments that have
bad to refuse orders solely because they could not
get cars to haul their goods. So strong has been the
pressure for more rolling-stock that the orders given
for cars and locomotives this year are well nigh be
yond the capacity of the car and locomotive build
ers to supply, so that the glut appears in spots all
along the lines of our industrial life.
Such conditions cannot be permanent. It is not
for nothing ' that we ' commonly speak of trade as
flowing in channels. Commerce is,' in fact, governed
by laws very much like those which regulate the run
ning of waters. When an obstruction stops the flow
of water there is for a time a cessation of the stream,
but eventually the water either finds a new channel
around the obstruction' or else overflows it. So it is
with trade. An obstruction here or there never per
manently stops it. There is no reason to believe
that the fruit supply of California is yet equal to the
full needs of the American market. The trouble is
that through the existing channels of trade the fruit
cannot find its way to the market. Better methods of
transportation and of distribution would soon put an
end to every appearance of a glut. . . Â».
: To devise a means of reaching the whole American
market expeditiously and cheaply is now the problem
'which engages the attention of fruit-growers and
fruit-dealers alike. It is a difficult problem, but in
the end it will be solved. American energy and
sagacity have never yet been balked by difficulties of
that kind. If nothing else avail we can imitate the
Southerners, who, when they found they could not
sell their cotton at a fair price, proceeded to manu
facture it at home. California can find a profit in
working up into preserves, jams,. jellies and confec
tions a Ir.rge quantity of the fruit which she now
sends East to be sold for what it will bring. "The
present glut may therefore in the end prove to be a
profitable experience for us.
If our Eastern friends needed anything more in the
ivay of lessons to teach them the folly of admitting
Chinese to this country they can find it by reading re
ports of the highbinder war that has just broken out
in this city. It is not easy to enforce American law
even in an American city where the Mongolians are
permitted to live in any numbers.
For a little <â  while the Germans have ceased de
nouncing American competition and the British war
policy. The action of the Kaiser in removing from
command a colonel who was responsible ; for a . fatal
duel in his regiment has given them troubles of their
own to talk "about
A MENACE TO ALL.
BY the resolutions submitted by Supervisor
â  Braunhart on Monday, public attention is,
once more directed to the extraordinary/
commission whose appointment is provided for by ,
Assembly constitutional amendment No. 28, to be i
submitted to the voters of the State at the next elec
tion. The Call has several times pointed out the per
nicious features of the scheme, but the subject is one
to which reference cannot too often be made. In fact,
a continuous campaign of education should be carried
on against it until all citizens have been fully warndd
of its dangers and its defeat at the polls has been as
sured.
The amendment in question provides for the cre
ation of a State Commission of five persons, are
to be clothed with powers to fix all rates and charges
for transportation of passengers and freight, and all
other services by all common carriers; to fix all
rates and charges for water, electric. light and power
and gas; to fix all-rates and. charges for telephone
arid telegraphic service; to fix^all rates and charges
for sleeping-car companies and corporations, and to
make regulations concerning the same; to ' fix the
rates and charges for express companies or corpora
tions and all express. service, and also to make regu
lations concerning, them. >â¢/â >
With respect to the powers .prescribed the com
mission is to be the successor to the BankCommis
lioners, the Insurance Commission, Boards of Super
1 isors, City Councils, and other governing bodies of
counties, cities and towns in the .State." /In fact,: so
far as regards fixing rates and making regulations for
the. various services stated, the commission is to be
supreme, and it is also clothed with power to exact
D license from all persons engaged in any of the speci
fied industries. Finally, it is provided that any license
fixed by the commission shall be conclusively deemed'
jtist and reasonable. â¢â  v 'â â¢' ; - :
A commission clothed with % ; such. ; . extraordinary,
powers would be objectionable on that ground alone
were it otherwise commendable. The, proposed com
mission, however, is made still more objectionable by Y
the manner in which its members are to be chosen.
It is provided in the amendment that the commis-;,.
sion shall be composed of five membersâ the .first" 'set'
to be appointed by the Governor, fbr two,' four,. six,,
eight and ten years, and afterward they. are to be.
elected at the general elections for , terms of ten
years, their salaries to be $6000 per annum, .with
power to appoint as many attaches as they see fit.
Here, then, is a proposition to^give} the Governor
power to appoint a commissioruwhicli will take over
to itself a considerable portion of the powers now
vested in local authorities or in existing- commis-.
sions. Of the members thus appointed one would
serve for as long as ten years, another for eight/ The
majority of the original appointees would serve, for
six years. It would have dealings -with eyery.rimppr
tant corporation in the State.'. It . would override^ all
local authority in the regulation of . many matters
which concern the locality alone. In short;- it ' would
go far toward destroying locar self-government in af
fairs where it is of highest importance that lo'calgpv^
ernment prevail. " l-r. .'â¢;..; :.-,Â»-'â .':>
Can it be necessary to point out to any," intelligent 1 '
citizen what would be the certain, result of the adop-J
tion of the proposed amendment? The commission.;
would be appointed by the Governor, but at the dic
tation of the great corporations." It wo'ujd be'a-Her:
rin commission," and he would hold 'it "for six;years
at least. Even when the time came for the people to
elect a member of the commission the corporations
would unite to bring about the nomination of a ser
viceable tool of their; own for the office.. THe cor-:
porations could well afford to pay high for control of
a commission with such extraordinary powers, and it
is a foregone conclusion they would not hesitate to'
make the payment.
The Braunhart resolution provides that the-Mayor
shall appoint a committee of five to communicate
with all Boards of Supervisors, City Councils and :
Town Trustees throughout the State for the purpose
of arranging for joint action in working to defeat the
scheme. The resolution has been referred to the
Judiciary Committee. It is to be hoped it will â  be
promptly acted upon. It is true the election is still
far off, but where a campaign of education upon a
new issue of such importance as^this has to be car-,
ried out it is always wise to begin early. .
It is said that many of the Cubans . who are in
Washington to work for reciprocity are really in
favor of annexation and are using the reciprocity
scheme as a step in-that direction; so it "would seem
there is not a single reciprocity proposition now be
fore the country that hasn't some kind of a trick
in it. .. >
GERMAN WAR TALK.
BARON VON EDELSHEIN; a German of
ficer of the Second Uhlans, is publishing what
may be called armed essays, in which he makes
a large number of German invasions of other countries
and wins victories which make the laurels of Von
Moltke, Waldteufel and Unser Fritz look as , if they
had been'exposed to the frost. The Herr -Baron in
vades the United; States and lays us prostrate at the.
Kaiser's feet in a few pages of "active campaigning...
He is good enough to say that our country is too
large to be overrun territorially, but we-are to be
conquered "by cutting the. great arteries of exporta
tion and importation, so as to paralyze the industrial
and commercial life of the United States."
He makes no note of what we will be doing while ;
this process of cutting our. goozle. string for paralytic
purposes is going on, but states exactly the number
of men his country will need to paralyze us, an.d if
will be just 96,000. Against this force, which is to :
fall upon us as "a surprise," by the way, he estimates
that we cannot oppose more than 20,000 men. As he
remarks that our troops are still armed with the old
style muzzle-loader guns, he finds no difficulty in
having our 20,000 men consumed and digested by % his
96,000. After we are laid low he is not certain
whether. we will be incorporated as a province in the
empire or ruled as a colony.; Frankly, we share the
uncertainty Â»with;the Herr Baron.' /We can't make up
our mind which we would' like;. better, and are dis
posed to spar for time until we find out. : â¢ â¢
We suppose that after -we are caught , and tamed
the Herr will kindly unpafalyze us, give.us the use of
our -limbs again and let us take the air under, proper
guard. â¢ .' 'i â¢--â¢."â â 'â¢ :â  â  - 'â¢
Now,- we desire to warn the Baron that >11 this-busi
ness will violate the Monroe doctrine. 'Has he heard
of Major Monroe of. our Revolutionary army? Well,
the Herr Major* Monroe had a doctrine, which we
beg the Herr Baron to sufficiently respect, because
the Â»Herr Major Monroe is dead and cannot receive
his apologies. Surely if the Herr Baron will not re
spect our muzzle-loading guns arid our "great arteries
of importation', and exportation," and our other feel
ings, he will respect the dead. . - ' : . ' â

who is a Uhlan? Probably the best we can do is to
take our "great arteries' of importation and exporta
tion" in. nights,'. and ring the curfew on our 20,000
men so that they, can 'be kept off, the streets and out
of danger -during the' dark hours, and then wait^ pa
tiently until our fate overtakes us.
All the Bryanite papers are expressing great hopes
of a fight between the President and the Republican
majority in. Congress, but it goes. without* saying that
they-" will be disappointed. The Republican majority
in Congress is large and strong, but it will none the

selves. .' V ; -'^ V â 'â ''''"â¢ ".'â '

of the President's . message is. the .emphasis -'

In referring, to^the dejath of .McKinleyjthe President
notes particularlyi that the' .was = ''one of 'the strongest
champions the wage-worker has ever # had,'' 'and goes
on to say: "He had, just: been ire-elected, to,-,the*
Presidency -because the majority ; ofVour Tcitizens, â  the
majority â¢: of vdu'f' farmers an'd wage-workers, .believed

Finally, in discussing the tariff and reciprocity,
the' President says: , "Our first duty, is to see that the
protection granted by the tariff in every case where,
it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be
sought for. so far as it can be. safely done without in
jury to our home industries. Just how far this is
must be determined according to the individual
case, remembering always that every application of
our... tariff policy to meet shifting national needs
must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that
the duties must never be reduced. below, the point that
will cover the difference between the labor cost here
and abroad. The well-being of the wage-worker
is the prime consideration of our entire, policy of
economic legislation." â â 'â ';. â ;.'_'" ... >.
These statements are expressions of the truest
Republicanism, and'. it is gratifying* to find them so
clearly and emphatically, asserted by, the President.
It is indeed a cardinal doctrine of all Republican
platforms that ..the well-being of the wage-worker
is the prime consideration of economic legislation,
and it is for that feason; that, despite the ravings.of
demagogues, the : ;mass iof the ' American . people re
main true to the party and support its candidates.
CHRISTMAS FOR THE POOR
A .CIRCULAR- letter issued by. Colonel- George
French of the Salvation Army 'announces that
in accordance- with acustom pursued for many
years the army is now making preparations, for pro
viding, a bountiful Christmas dinner for the poor of
the city, and. appeals to. the benevolent for assistance
in'the'work.' â  . ,'-:.. â¢ .'".!.". V.' . ;.' "'
The letter states {hat last Christmas the army gave
dinners to over 2006 people' in this city, and through
put the whole'country to upward of 160,000. It is th e
aim this year to provide for fully as many, if' not
more, and accordingly a liberal-response' from sym
pathetic; persons is desired' as'.; promptly .as ..possible.
' That', there are a -large number ; of â¢ deserving poor
in the; city -to whom such -a gift of Christmas cheer
will be necessary i, for an enjoyment of the great
Christian festival isf indisputable. . Despite the pre
vailing-prosperity there are, many .who/ have not
shared ;in it. ;Ill;heaith,; lack of work or" other inci

them. from profiting by -the general; welfare of the
countryl To these it is only right that help should
be given at all times, arid particularly, at the season
.when it; is the desire of all that, something of the
Christmas joy should cometo every man, woman and
child in the community. .- ; r Â«I. : : , ;
; The effectiveness of the . service 'of - the Salvation
Army in caring for. the welfare and the wants of the
poor is well known. Any charitable work , under- â¢

MORE TROUBLE
FOR KNOWLTON
Restored Vice Principal
Is Charged With
Incompetency.
Zimmerman Weakens and
Refuses to Stand
Trial
Ebenezer Knowlton, formerly vice prin
cipal of the John Swett School, who was
suspended for one year for offensive re
marks to his pupils, is in trouble again.
At yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Education Principal Lyser filed a report
that , Knowlton is so entirely lacking in
the power to properly control children
that the discipline in his class is poor.
Lyser says the only serious accident that
has ever occurred in the schoolyard In
sixteen years was the breaking of a boy's
arm through rough play and that it took
place when Knowlton was in sole charge
during the noon recess of October 14.
Lyser says further that Knowlton's
method of instruction is bad and charges
him with incompetency and general un
fltnc&s for teaching. The board set Mon
day at 10 a. m. for the hearing of the
charges.
Mayor Phelan transmitted a petition of
taxpayers requesting. that provision be
made in the bend issue for a modern
schoolhouse on Clay street, between Wal
nut and Laurel, instead of wasting $10,000,
as now recommended, for the addition of
four rooms to the present building. The
matter has been attended to by the Su
pervisors, who have incorporated an item
of ?50,000 for such a building in the decla
ratory ordinance.
The resignations of Mrs. O. Mann and
Mrs. M. C. Martin as teachers were ac
cepted.
The oral examination of applicants for
positions on the eligible list of teachers
will be held December 28. 1901, at the City
Hall and the Girls' High School was desig
nated as the place for holding the written
competitive examination of applicants on
Monday, December SO, 1901. All applica
tions must be made before December 18,
1901. In accordance with the plan published
in August, 1901. by the Board of Educa
tion. All applicants whose applications
have heretofore been made may take the
examinations without reapplication, re-
Bcrdless of whether they have taken any
of the examinations and all applicants are
permitted to take either or both of the
examinations to be held in December, 1901.
Owing to the continued illness of Miss
A. M. Cobb she was granted a leave of
absence from the Bernal School until Jan
uary 6. 1902. Leave of absence was also
granted to Miss M. Simon.
The board met again in the afternoon
to try William Zimmerman, German
teacher in the Polytechnic School, at his
own request on charges preferred by Prin
cipal Bush. Zimmerman had changed his
mind, however, and the board was pre
vented from proceeding by a writ of in
junction served at Zimmerman's instance.

Stabbed in Left Arm.
A man went to the office of Dr. d'Er
cole, 1614 Stockton street, Tuesday night
to have a wound in his left arm attended
to. Policeman Peshon was notified and
went to the office. The wounded man

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
KILL THE DANDRUFF GERM
Or Your Hair Will Fall Out Till You
Become Bald.
Modern science has discovered that
dandruff Is caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp in scales, as It burrows
down to the roots of the hair, where It
destroys the hair's vitality, causing fall-
ing hair, and. ultimately, baldness.
After Prof. Unna, of Hamburg, Ger-
many, discovered the dandruff germ, nil
efforts to find a remedy failed until the
great laboratory discovery was made
which resulted in Newbro's Herpiclde.
It alcne of all hair preparations
kills the dandruff germ. ' "Without dan-
druff, hair grows luxuriantly. "Destroy
the cause, you remove the effect."

FRUIT MEN FAVOR ENACTMENT
OF NEW LAWS ON CONTRACTS
Spirited Debate Is Brought Aboiit by Introduction of
Proposed Tlemorikl to Legislature.
ORGANIZATION and co-operation
were the subjects set down for
discussion at the second day's
session of the Fruit Growers'
Convention yesterday at Pioneer
Hall, but they took a much wider range,
despite the efforts of Chairman Cooper to
keep the speakers within bounds.
F. N. Righters of Campbell opened the
morning session with a proposition to In
dorse the President's message and sug
gested that a committee be named to
prepare and telegraph suitable resolu
tions. Chairman Cooper ruled the motion
out of order on the grdund that only
matters appertaining to the fruit Indus
try could be considered. N. W. Mother
all of Kings County came to the rescue
with a proposition that the committee so
named consider such portions only of the
message as related to the horticultural
and agricultural interests of California.
In that shape the resolution was adopted.
E. F. Adams of Santa Cruz, who had
charge of the work of interesting the
consular service in furnishing reports,
spoke of his work and the worK done by
Eiugene Goodwin of the Pacific Commer
cial Museum. Naftzger of Los Angeles
suggested resolutions of thanks to Secre
tary of State Hay, but action was post
poned in order to afford Mr. Goodwin an
opportunity to deliver an address on the
work so tar accomplished. He told of
the difficulties at first encountered and
of the success of the plan later.- â¢
Adams presented the following resolu

National Quarantine Law.
Naftzger brought up the matter of the
necessity of enforcing a/national quaran
tine. He prepared a set of resolutions,
which -were unanimously adopted by the
convention. They read as follows:
Feeling as deeply as ever the vital necessity
for a national quarantine law for the protection
of our fruit Industry against the importations
of fruit or trees, plants, shrubs, vines, buds
or - cuttings, commonly called nursery stock,
infested with any disease, scale or Insect pest,
we, the fruit growers of California, In con
vention assembled, hereby give our cordial ap
proval to House bill No. H. R. 96, Introduced
into the Fifty-sixth Congress by Mr. Wads
worth, and we do most- earnestly request all
members of Congress from California to use
their best efforts to secure the enactment into
law of the Wadsworth bill or one embodying
similar provisions establishing national quar
antine regulations. " â¢ , -
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be
sent to each member of Congress from Cal-'
ifornla. .
VThe Work of the California Fresh
Fruit Exchange" was the paper read by
A. R. Sprague* of Sacramento. The ex
change had been hurriedly, organized, Mr.
THEODORE KEARNEY OF FRESNO, DELIVERING AN ADDRESS ON RAIS
INS, RAISIN GROWERS AND PACKERS BEFORE THE FRUIT GROW
ERS' CONVENTION YESTERDAY AT PIONEER HALL.
Sprague said) but was now in good run- :
nlng order. The reader continued:
During the past year, the first of our or
ganization, -we handled fruit to the value of
1208,000. at an expense of 111,000. With five
months in which to prepare for the coming
season we feel that we will be enabled to do
twice as much business next year.
A. G. McAdie of the Weather Bureau
was present and extended an invitation
to the delegates to visit his office and
talk about frost.
Theodore Kearney of Fresno spoke on
the raisin industry. He apologized for
not preparing a paper on the subject Riv
ing an account of his experiences with
raisins, raisin growers and packers. He
said: ,
There is one thing about the raisin business,
which is also true of all fruit business â you
must- -fix a -price and maintain it. Contracts
must be so drawn as to bind the grower to de
liver the fruit when he contracts to do so.
For failure to do this last season the raisin
growers of Fresno only received an average of
2% cents a pound for their raisins, when they
might have received. 4Ms cents and-, upward.
There is necessity for legislative action In this
regard and the matter should be presented to
the next Legislature.
On the suggestion of W. H. Ai'ken, Mr.
Kearney was instructed to prepare a
memorial for the consideration of the
convention and later the Legislature.
Subjects to Be Considered.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Chairman Cooper announced that the
subjects in the President's message to be
considered by the committee were the
Nicaragua canal, irrigation and forest
preservation, extention of the consular
service in the interests of manufacturers
and producers and the Pacific cable. F.
N. Righter, William Johnson and N. W.
Motherall were named the committee.
W.' J. Hotchklss in his paper on the
future of the wine industry of, the State
claimed that the success of the industry
would depend more upon increased pro
duction of cheaper wines, so that on the
table of the laborer they could compete
with beer, milk or coffee in price. He
claimed the San Joaquin Valley would in
a few years become the greatest wine
producing region of the West.
His views were discussed and combatted
by Professor E. W, Hilgard, Professor
Hausmann of Napa, W, H. Aiken and
others.
. R. D. Stephens of Sacramento, chair
man of the permanent committee on
transportation, who his had as much to
do with advancing the fruit interests^of
California as any other man in the State,
asked for further time in which to make
the report.' The matter will be specially
taken up this afternoon. It is deemed one
of the most important to come before the
convention. . . -,
A very lively debate was precipitated
when Theodore Kearney presented a
memorial, first 'to be presented to a com
mittee of seven drawn from the conven
tion, later on that committee's report to
the convention of next year, and then to
the Legislature. The memorial is as fol
lows:
Resolved, That whereas our laws, as Inter
preted . by . the courts, enable manufacturers
and others to form combinations and control
prices through a sale of any number of prop
erties to â¢ one concern, and that these laws
practically forbid the fbrmation of associations
of producers for a similar purpose because it
is not possible to vest the , title to innumer
able farms in one company; and that this con
dition Is a gross â  injustice to all producers,
and constitutes one of the greatest obstacles
to the general prosperity of the whole State,'
in that it compels them to pay combination
prices - for everything . they buy while pre
venting" them â  from â¢â  obtaining combination
prices for what they have to sell; and
Resolved, That as it is absolutely essential
to the success of our nroducers that they form
associations among themselves .for, the proper
grading and marketing of- their products, -the
Legislature of this State is hereby respectfully,
petitioned i to enact ' a law at . its next session
which will effectively and immediately place
our producers â  on an â  equality before the law
in this respect with any and all combinations.
Discuss the Trust Question.
In the speeches that followed: the ques-
tion of trusts was fully discussed by
Naftzger, Kearney, Motherall, Jacobs,
Aiken and Sprague. The fate of the
memorial was trembling in the balance
when F. J. Fitch of Loomis moved to lay
it on the table. ; Chairman Cooper said
he did not think such a course was ad
visable, and Fitch withdrew his motion.
Sprague and Naftzger offered, amend
ments, and it was finally adopted with
the understanding that the committee will
confine its deliberations to a consideration
of co-operative laws and suggest amend
ments thereto. â  â¢ 4
Naftzger offered the following resolu
tion wnich was adopted amid consider
able applause:
Whereas, the commissioners from fifteen
States and nine foreign countries, represented
at the Pan-American Exposition, recently held
at Buffalo, in the State of New York, have
united In- recommending one of California's
citizens, the Hon. J. A. Filcher, for Chief of
the Department of Horticulture at the forth
coming Louisiana Purchase Exposition, to be
held at the city of St. Louis, State of Mis
souri, in the year 19C3; and
Whereas, the recommendation has been in
dorsed by thirty-six out of thirty-eight ex
hibitors in the Department of Horticulture at
the late Pan-American Exposition; therefore
be It
Resolved, That the fruit-growers of Cali
fornia, In State convention assembled, recog
nize and .appreciate .the compliment to our
State and one of its citizens, and most heartily
unite in recommending* Mr. Filcher for the im
portant position named, believing that his
Identity with our interests, his long residence
in California and particularly his very exten
sive and successful, experience in exposition
work, both in this country and in Europe,
coupled with his recognized energy and execu
tive ability, mark him as the man in all the
West, and for aught we know in the country
at large, most eminently qualified for this dis
tinguished and very important position.
We believe his appointment would not only
be a guarantee of energetic and efficient work,
but would carry with it the assurance' that
at St. Louis, for ' once In the history of ex
positions, the great and rapidly growing hor
ticultural interests of the world would re
ceive the recognition their importance de
mands.
Everybody felt. In -good humor at the
close of the meeting, J. A. Filcher hav
ing given them a synopsis of his experi
ences in Buffalo in a humorous vein.
The morning session to-day will be de
voted to the ladies. Mrs. Emma Shatter
Howard will be the principal speaker.

WINTER TRAVEL
FROM THE EAST
Cold Weather Is Driving
Hundreds of People
to\ California.
Local Hotels Are Crowded
and Many Other Visitors
Are Coming.
Visitors are daily arriving In large num
bers from the East and the winter travel
this year promises to be the heaviest in
the annals of railroad history on the coast.
There Is quite a fight going: on between the
lines running to Florida and those run
ning to California and the officers of the
competing systems are making elaborate
arrangements for the comfort of those
who are fleeing from the rigid weather
of the East.
California is at present in the lead, as
it is the most popular objective polnffor
the travelers. Coronado and Del Monte
expect to do a thriving winter business
and the hotels in this city are already
crowded with Eastern visitors.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have
been spent by the Santa Fe and the
Southern Pacific Company in an attempt
to corner the travel. E. O. McCormick,
passenger traffic manager of the South
ern Pacific, has been working night and
day covering every detail, -while George
Nicholson, who holds the same position
with the Santa Fe and makes his head
quarters in Chicago, has put on special
trains to attract travel to the road he
represents.
' The Southern Pacific since the first of
the month has been running seven over
land trains daily into this city. Two of
these are over the Sunset, three over the
Ogden and two over the Shasta route.
The Santa Fe has in service one of the
finest trains in the world. It Is made up
exclusively of sleeping caxs and private
coaches are not allowed to be attached to
the train.
The homeseekers' rate, which goes into
effect in the early spring, will not be de
cided upon until the next meeting of the
Transcontinental Passenger Association,
to be held In New Orleans the early part
of next month. The Southern Pacific
hauled over thirty thousand homeseekers
to the coast last year and the corporation
is anxious to have the low rate renewed.
Pardee Still in Jail.
S. C. Pardee, ex-clubman, appeared in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday to answer
to two additional charges of . obtaining
money by false pretenses, prefererd by
Jesse Colman and Eugene Korn. The
cases were continued till December 9.
Pardee was booked on another charge
yesterday, the complaining witness being
C. H. Rehnstrom, tailor, Phelan building.
The prisoner has his meals sent to him in
prison and some friends sent him a box of
cigars yesterday.
Pardee's troubles are rapidly increasing.
A suit was filed against him yesterday by
the Fidelity and Casualty Company of
New York to recover $4199 26, which the
company claims they advanced to him.

A triduum will be inaugurated at St.
Francis Church on Vallejo street thi3

land will preach. The Rev. Father Horan
of St. Patrick's Church of this city will

j-ggpjOLLAR for dollar, pound for pound, there is
"tji more in Ivory Soap than in any household
4g|p| soap. It is easy to find a cheap soap ; but
iHO to find purity and low price in a single soap
is not easy. They combine in Ivory Soap. You
can afford to use it in the laundry; you can not

ROBERT WILSON
IS ACQUITTED
Alleged Slayer of Mag
gie Hartwell Is Set
Free by Jury.
Robert G. Wilson, the ex-policeman ac
cused of killing Maggie Hartwell, a 13
year-old girl on the night of July 4, 1S01,
while she was playing with a lot of other
children near Wilson's home on Shipley
street, between Fourth and Fifth,
was acquitted by a jury in Judge Dunne's
court yesterday. The jury had been
locked up at the California Hotel from 11
a. m. Tuesday to 4 p. m. yesterday. The
verdict rendered was a complete surprise
to both the attorneys for the prosecution
and the defense, as it was thought that
some punishment would be meted out to
the aged prisoner.
Wilson admitted firing a shot at the
time that little Maggie was seen to fall,
but it could nGt be proved that the bullet
from his revolver was the one that killed
the young girl.
Wilson, who Is an old man. displayed
no emotion when the verdict was an
nounced. He shook hands with his law
yers, smiled and prepared to leave the
courtroom.
From one of the jurymen it was learned
that on the first ballot seven of them
voted for acquittal and five for conviction '
The vote stood at 7 to 5 for several hours
when three of those who first believed
him guilty changed their votes, making
lÂ«â¢ en t r t 0^ 11181 an d two for convic
Â» J i! st before the jury left the rooms
at the hotel, prepared to announce that
they could not agree on a verdict, the two

Innocent man.

HEALTH BOARD
NAMES HASSLER
Succeeds Chalmers as
Chief Sanitary In
spector.
The Board of Health met last night
and appointed Dr. "William C. Hassler
from the civil service eligible list to suc
ceed Dr. William P. Chalmers. Hassler
received the unanimous vote of the five
members of the board, although Dr. A.
S. Keenan was nominated by Dr. Lewitt.
A scheme was concocted to secure tho
reappointment of Chalmers to the posi
tion, although he stood fifth on the eligi
ble list and was too low down to be
among the first three to be certified by
the Civil" Service Commission. When the
results of the examination were an
nounced there were five eligibles for the
position, which pays a salary of $150 per
month. They were William G. Hassler,
96.6 per cent; Alexander S. Keenan, D5.3;
F. H. Stahle, 94.5; W. L. Athey, i>5.3, and
William P. Chalmers, 82.7.
It was ascertained by the commission
that an understanding had been arrived
at by some of those who preceded Chal
mers on the list that they would with
draw in order that Chalmers might be
certified for the place and thns secure
reappointment. Keenan sent a letter to
the Civil Service Commission waiving
certification, but several days after ho
withdrew his request. Stahle is now em
ployed as a clerk in the Tax Collec
tor's office and elected to remain where
he is, and the commission acquiesced.
When the Board of Health made requi
sition for three eligibles the names of
Hassler, Keenan and Athey were certi
fied. Athey thereupon petitioned the
Civil Service Commission to waive certi
fication. This would have permitted the
certification of Chalmers as the third, to
gether with Hassler and Keenan, but the
commission denied Athey's petition and
Chalmers was thus crowded out.
Athey, with the evident desire of help
ing Cnalmers, thereupon sent a communi
cation to the Civil Service Commission
resigning from the list altogether. The
commission also held a meeting last
night, but postponed action on his re
quest until this afternoon. Its action will
not affect the result, however, as the
Health Board has already made the aD
pointment. v

Mrs. Lillie Florine Friend Asks for
Divorce Because Her Husband
Is Cruel.
Lillie Florine Friend, wife of Welling
ton D. Friend, Is very sensitive and be
cause of that sensitiveness she is suing
for a divorce. Her husband, she says,
compelled her to live in a ' very small
room, thereby causing her great mental
anguish, and he added to her suffering,
she claims, by filling the room full of
tobacco smoke each evening after sup
per. He promised her a folding bed, says
Mrs. Friend, and because he failed to ful
fill his promise she suffered. great mental
torture. Another reason for "her great
mental anguish," says the plaintiff is
that her husband never Inquired after her
health, and one night he upset her nerves
by interrupting her mother in conversa
tion and asking her "what she was
squeaking about?"
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by Elizabeth V. Berry from Charles M
Berry, for failure to provide, and Annie
Patten from Thomas J. Patten, for fail
ure to provide.
Mary Manning was granted a divorce

and that Smith drew up the disputed will
at the request of Kershow.
Tauszky said further that Kershow had
told several persons that he would pro
vide for Rhea Gettlngs, to whom he was
greatly attached. Tauszky said Kershow
did not think his brother needed any of
his estate, and left him $5000, merely all
a token of his brotherly regard.
"The will," said Attorney Tauszky,
"was quietly drafted by Smith be
cause Kershow did not desire to
be* annoyed, as would have been
the cage if his relatives and his fam
ily attorney, M. F. Michael, learned of
his intentions. The will was drawn up
on the evening of April 5, and Smith went
out to look for a second subscribing wiU
noss. He met A. J. Meadows, who was
one of several suggested by Kershow, and
arranged with him to visit the sick man's
room the next morning to witness the
signing of the docament." -
Says He Drew Up the Will.
Registrar Walsh was the first witness
called by the proponents. He brought
with iÂ».m an attldavit of change of resi
dence signed by Kershow in May, L.-J.
It was placed in evidence for the purpose
of supplying the court with an authentic
signature of Kershow. It was identified
by Rhea Gettings, though strong objec
tions were made by the attorneys for the
contestants. *
Joseph Morgan Smith, who drew up
the will, was then placed on the witness
stand. He testified as follows:
"I first met Max Kershow at the Hol
land House, New York City, in the fall of
1898. I again met him in Chicago in De
cember of the same year, and the third
time I met him was at the Maison Riche
in this city in November, 1899. Both of
us were living there. We were very
friendly. Kershow drank a good deal, but
was sober half the time. I think I had
something to do with his taking the Hon
olulu trip. He was perfectly sane at that
time.
"Miss Gettings, who was with Max at
the Maison Riche, went with him. When
he returned from the islands our friend
ship was renewed and I spent a great
deal "of time in his company.
"I wrote the will at his request. On
the night of April 5 he called me and said
Morgie, get some writing paper. I want
to dictate something to you.' I complied
with his request, and he then told me
that he wanted his will drawn up. He
said he wanted the fact of his making it
kept absolutely secret, as he feared if his
relatives heard of it they would prevent
him from doing as he wanted, as they
had done, he said, 'many times during
his life.' 'I don't see why I should leave
my folks anything,' said Kershow.
-lhey have not done right by me.' "
"I drew several drafts of the will at his
dictation, and after he had dictated one
that suited him I copied it in ink.
"Max then spoke of the necessity of
having another witness' and named sev
eral acquaintances. He finally selected
A. J. Meadows, and I. went out to look
for him. I found Meadows, but he had
an appointment for that night and could
not come with me. He agreed to come
up to the room the next morning, and
when I told this to Kershow he said it
was satisfactory.
Attorneys Grow Wrathy.
"Meadows visited Kcrshow's rooms the
next morning and Max signed his name
to the document, .as did also Meadows
and myself as witnesses."
Smith told a straightforward story, and
much of his evidence was a direct con
tradiction of the evidence given by Alice
Kennedy, Kershow*s nurse, and a num
ber of other witnesses who testified on
behalf of the contestants.
Smith was cross-examined by Attorney
Rix for the contestants, but in the main
his testimony was unshaken./'
The cross-examination led to a war of
words between Lawyers Kowalsky and
Rix. Attorney Kowalsky interrupted
Rix in his questioning, and was told to
keep quiet by Rix, who said, "You can
have your witness to-night."
Kowalsky rose to his feet at tho re
mark and, addressing the court, said:
"Your Honor, I think we have in con
ducting this case refrained from dealing
in innuendo. And I might say we have
not attempted to bribe any witnesses"
â¢I brand any insinuation that we have
offered witnesses money as unqualifiedly

he said, "Mr. Kowalsky, you know the

MANY ATTEND FUNERAL
OF LATE WALTER MALLOY
Workmen Pay Last' Tribute to One
Â» â¢ â  Who Was Prominent in
the Order.
Hundreds of people filled the Ruby Hall
of the Red Men's building Tuesday after
noon to pay the last tribute, of respect to
the memory of the late Walter Malloy,
former, president of the Stere'otypers'
Union and a prominent member of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen. He
was a past master of Golden Gate Lodge
and at the time of his death secretary of
the San Francisco extension committee of
the order.
At the head of the casket were many
floral tributes.
As the pallbearers entered the hall,
bearing the casket, Rudolph Isenbruck,
master workman of Franklin Lodge, played
a solemn march on the organ, after which
the very impressive service of the order
was conducted by Past Master Martin
Glennon of Golden Gate Lodge, assisted by
the other . officers, a choir rendering ap
propriate music. Past Grand Master
Barnes, in a most touching address, dwelt
upon the life work of the deceased.
The remains were taken to Laurel Hill
for interment, and there the closing nor
tlon of the service was held. â

LIBRARY SITE
TO BE SELECTED
Supervisors' Committee
Will Frame Report
To-Morrow.
Members of Mechanics' Insti
tute to Discuss Sale of
Pavilion.
Definite action is likely to be taken this
week in the matter of the proposed ac
quisition by the city of San Francisco of
the Mechanics' Pavilion property, for the
site of the Carnegie Public Library.
Although the municipal authorities and
the trustees of the Mechanics' Institute do
not agree as to the value of the : property,
it Is believed that a satisfactory arrange
ment Will shortly be effected. . -V
â¢ The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
ask $750,000 for the Pavilion property,
while the Beard of; Supervisors think
$65O,UOO Is sufficient. ..
The Committee on Judiciary and Public !
Utilities of the Board of Supervisors m'e"ets j
to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock and will
report upon the question to the board.
On Saturday night af 8 o'clock the quar
terly meeting of the members of the Me
chanics' Institute will be held and the sale
of the Pavilion property will be thor
oughly discussed. . :.
The sentiment among the majority â¢ of
the members. of the Mechanics' Institute
is that the Pavilion site should bring ?750,- I
000 and should the city undertake to.ac- i
quire it by condemnation proceedings f or i
a less sum there is likely to be a legal
wrangle.
Bef use to Accept Experts' Report.
"When Andrew Carnegie offered a quar
ter of a million dollars to the people of
San Francisco for the erection of a pub- ,
lie library it. was upon condition that a
suitable site be furnished for the building, i
A number of -locations were mentioned '
and finally Mayor Phelan asked the trus- <
tees of the Mechanics' Institute If it
would donate or sell the Pavilion lot.:
The trustees replied that they would sell ;
and engaged three experts to value the
property.
The experts .reported that the site was
worth $600,000 and the improvements $50
000, but the trustees were not satisfied
with the report. The members of the in
stitute were adviffed by thÂ» trustees not to
accept the figures of the experts, but to
offer the property to the city for $750,000. -
The majority of the trustees are of the
opinion that $750,000 should be paid for the
Pavilion site. The building cost $100,000
and the site was purchased in 1881 for
$175,000. The trustees think that as they
would have to wait for one year for their
money if the city buys the site that in
.terest ought to be allowed on the experts'
valuation. Then the trustees state that
their tenants on the Hayes-street side of
the Pavilion would vacate as soon as the
sale " was completed and the institute
would lose the rent. Another reason
given by the trustees for asking $750,000 is
that the validity of the proposed bonds to
buy the site will have to be passed upon
by the Supreme Court, and though the
sale might be perfected, the institute
would be unable to make contracts to rent
the Pavilion, as the uncertainty of the sit
uation would not allow them to guarantee
the contracts. ' .
Proceedings to Date,
â  The proceedings taken by the Board of
Supervisors to date are as follows:
On October 7 the trustees of the Mechanics,'
Institute offered the Pavilion property to the
city for $750.00p.
. On November 11 last the board allowed a
resolution to be filed to authorize the Board of
Public Works to file appraisements of value
,of the Mechanics' Pavilion Bite and the Fair
estate property, bounded by Powell, Sacra
mento. Mason and California, streets. The
resolution was approved on November 15.
On November 18 the Board n' Public Works
filed the appraisements with t j Board of Su
pervisors. The Mechanics' Pavilion site was
valued at $600,000 and the improvements at
$50,000. The Fair estate property was appraised
at $225,000.
The Board of Supervisors after considering
the report decided to purchase the Pavilion
property for $650,000. On November 25 a bill
was passed to print providing for the acquisi
tion of the property and the issuance of the
necessary bonds.
The City Attorney, however, rendered a de
cision that the- wording: of the bill was de
fective and the entire matter was sent back
to the Committee on Judiciary and Public Util
ities for a new bill to be drafted.
The report of the committee to be made
to-morrow afternoon is awaited with con
siderable interest by the members of the
Mechanics' Institute, who will themselves
take a hand in the matter on Saturday
night. â

Johnson had just reached the corner
when a man stepped out of the darkness
and threw an arm around his neck, try
ing to choke him. Another footpad took
the money out of his pocket and grabbed
his watch chain. He struggled with the
robber who was choking him and bom
fell to the ground. While the two men.
were down the second robber strucic

WILLIAM GILCHRIST HONORED.âWil
liam Gilchrist, deputy internal revenue col
lector In the ofnee of - Collector Lynch, was
elected last Tuesday night worshipful master
of Oriental Lodge No. 144, F. and A JLSENDS PETITIONS
TO WASHINGTON
Hints to Budd, Phelan,
Truxton Beale and
Others.
Excluded Speech of Orator
Shortridge May Be
Forwarded.
Politicians of both parties consider that
the message of President Roosevelt rec
oismendinsr the re-enactment of the Chi
nese exclusion law practically settles that
Question. When the fact Is taken into ac
count that both houses of Congress are al
most unanimous in their support of the
President on this proposition it can be
readily seen that the Congressional dele
gation chosen to represent the people of
California in the Senate and House of
Representatives can easily promote the
legislation desired without the assistance
of an outside committee.
There Is grave danger that the visiting
committeemen recently appointed by
Thomas J. Geary to go to Washington
and enlighten Congress might display
more zeal in politics than judgment in
legislation and thus obstruct rather than
advance the cause of exclusion. The rep
resentatives elected by the people are re
sponsible to the people and their able ef-
Xorta to protect the industrial forces of
the State from the unfair competition of
Asia should not be hampered by too
many outside suggestions. The right of
petition, however, ie guaranteed by' the
constitution and if ex-Governor Budd,
ilayor Phelan and Truxton Beale desire
to jjo on record as unequivocally opposed
to the admission of Chinese they can dis
play a tine sense of the fitness of things by
signing a petition favoring the re-enact
ment of the exclusion law. Our delega
tion in Congress would doubtless present
the petition under the rules and the
prayer of the petition would be properly
placed on the record. Ex-Governor Budd,
who has been in Congress, knows that
this is the right way to proceed and
Mayor Phelan, who hopes to get there,
ought to be steered right. Letters supple
menting the petition and presenting in
logical detail all the objections, indus
trial and political, to foreign Immigra
tion of the Asiatic type could be written
to our Senators and Representatives.
Tlie Report Should Be Fair.
It is certainly in order to send to Con
gress printed reports of the proceedings
of the late exclusion convention. The re
port should be fairly made up. It should
embrace the speeches made by represent
atives of the Union Labor party as well
as those made by the orators of the Re
publican and Democratic parties re
spectively.
A high-minded sense of courtesy might
suggest the printing of the speech pre
pared by the Hon. Samuel M. Sbortridge,
which was excluded because the orator
was persona con grata to the pro
grammers of the convention. Mr. Short
ridge, it is explained, was excluded from
the orators* zone because he happened to
have a Chinese client, but the true cause
of the exclusion was rank Jealousy. None
of the programmed speakers could match
him for eloquence of language or state
liness of gesture. Therefore he was turned
down and not permitted to speak.
Great Seal for Shortridge.
Indeed, it would be a graceful and pa
triotic act on the part of the printing
committee to embrace Mr. Shortridge' s
excluded speech in the volume of anti-
Chinese literature and send the same to
Washington along with the Budd-Phelan-
Beale petition. Governor Gage,, who is
makinp promiscuous use of the great seal
of the State, might countersign the Short
ridge excluded speech with one of the
seals. In -the late' municipal campaign
Shortridge. in sentences lofty and inspir
ing, pictured the glorious achievements
of Gage's administration of State affairs,
and it would not be out of place now for
the Governor to reach out and lend Sam
a great seal even if it resembled a gold
brick.
Internal Revenue Collectorship.
Dispatches from Washington represent
that Senators Perkins and Bard have in
troduced to the President the subject of
the collectorship of internal revenue.
First District of California. Senator Bard
recommends the appointment of Stephen
Kelly of San Bernardino. Senator Per
kins, it appears, expresses a desire for
the retention of John C. Lynch. The
story ccmes that President Roosevelt
pointedly told Pertcins to see hlfe col
leajrue and come to an agreement, indi
cating by his manner and language that
if the Senators failed to agree he would
settle the dispute by appointing a man
of his own selection. The President is
known to be a master in the art of ter
minatir.sr controversies. When he was
Asristant Secretary of the Navy, and
acting for the Secretary in the latter's
absence, the California delegation got
into a dispute concerning an appointment
in that department. Mr. Roosevelt listen
ed patiently for a time, but at lenjrth be
pran to show signs of irritation. Finally
he said to the contestants: "If 'you do
not settle this affair within one week I
will make the appointment."
Aged Carpenter Kills Himself.
John J. Vanderlip, an aged carpenter,'
who has been mentally deranged since
ho was injured In the Tesla coal yard
some time ago. fired a bullet Into his
brain lar.t night at his home, 215 Kent
avenue, and died instantly. The rela
tives of the dead man say that he has
been bent upon suicide for some time.

GEAPE-NUTS.
MEMORY FOOD.
A Case Where Memory Was Strength-
ened by Grape-Nuts.
Food that will actually help the mem-
ory as well as agree perfectly with a
delicate stomach is worth knowing of.
A good wife out Jn Alta, Iowa, who did
not know which way to turn to get food
that would agree with her husband, who
was left in a. weakened condition after a
eerious Illness and could scarcely retain
any food In his stomach, was one day
induced to try him on Grape-Nuts, the
famous ready-cooked breakfast food, and
from the first he began to improve rap-
idly. In three months he had gained 30
pounds.
She says that his stomach has recov-
ered so completely that he can now eat
any kind of food.
She mentions the boy of an intimate
acquaintance, who was 60 delicate and
thin that his appearance was pitiable and
he had no appetite for any ordinary food.
He was put on Grape-JCuts and liked the
crigpness and Eweetieh taste of the new
food and took to it. His Improvement
began at once and he Is now a healthy,
plump boy.
"I know that Grape-Nuts will do more
for weak stomachs than any medicine.
The claim that it will build up and
strengthen the brain has been proved to
my certain knowledge. Sister, who writes
for the press, and is compelled to mem-
orize a great deal, has been using Grape-
re -ts and says she is surprised at the re-
sult. There is a marked improvement In
her memory and the brain works more
perfectly and with better . results.

FIRES AT POLICE
WITH A SHOTGUN
Demented Man Locks
Himself in Cabin and
Shows Fight.
Zatario Simayini, a demented man,
caused a small sized war in Sutro forest
last night, which for a time looked as if
it would end in serious bloodshed. Slm
ayinf, who has been laboring around the
various quarry camps in that vicinity,
â went on a rampage and barricaded him
self, in a shack belonging to Jam*.s
Dernant, a mining man who Is prospect-
Ing on one of the side hills in the forest.
When Dernant tried to get into his cabin
Simayini fired the contents of 'a double
barreled shotgun at him. The aim of the
half-crazed man was very poor and the
leaden pellets went wide of their intend
ed mark. Dernant hastily fled from the
neighborhood and going to the nearest
telephone notified the police.
Lieutenant Price and a posse were de
tailed to go out and subdue the man with
the shotgun. When they arrived upon
the scene the real trouble began. The
police approached the shack and ordered
Simayini to open the door. He replied
by firing another load of buckshot
through the door. While he was reload
ing his gun the officers tried to break
down the door, but were unsuccessful.
Simayini remained behind the barricaded
door and fired three more shots at tha
officers.
Finally Sergeant Price's posse broke in
the door and. Officer Taylor jumped into
the room and sprang upon Simayini. [n
the struggle which ensued for possession
of the shotgun Taylor found it necessary
to rap Simayini on the head several
times with his club. He was finally over
powered and taken to the hospital, where
his wounds were dressed. Later he was
removed to the City Hall Prison, where
he was booked on a charge of assault
with intent to commit murder.

Faro Dealer in Baker
City Kills Man Who
Attacked Him.
BAKER CITY, Or., Dec. i.â George
Biles, a well known character in this city,
was shot and killed early this morning in
the Log Cabin saloon by David Staley,
a faro dealer. Staley was dealing the
game, when one of the players became
insulting and Staley ordered him to leave.
He refused to go and Staley arose to
eject him, when Biles, who was sitting
at the table, but not playing, interfered.
Staley told Biles to mind his own busi
ness. Biles arose with an oath, saying:
"I'll go and get heeled and get you."
Staley called another man to deal and
went- out into the saloon. Biles returned
about ten minutes later, armed with a
long knife, and started for Staley. When
about ten feet away Staley took up a
shotgun and shot Biles in the left breast.
Biles walked about ten feet and fell
dead.
Staley was arrested and placed In the
County Jail. The Coroner's jury to-day
returned a verdict justifying the killing
on the ground of self-defense.
CHIEF COUNSEL HEKBIN
LEAVES FOE NEW YORK
Goes Bast to Receive Orders as to His
Duties by President Har
riman.
William F. Herrln, chief counsel of the
Southern Pacific Company, left for New
York last evening. Julius Kruttschnltt
is still in New York, and it is supposed
that Herrin is to receive orders in re
gard to his duties in the future.
Kruttschnltt and Herrin never were
friendly, as the former always thought
Herrin mingled a great deal too much in
politics. It is supposed that Kruttschnitt
made a complaint to Harriman and said
that if he was to be his representative
in San Francisco he would like Herrin
to thoroughly understand* his position.
After Charles M. Hays retired it was
thought that Herrin had gained a vic
tory and that he would be the local-rep
resentative of. the Southern Pacific. This,
however, did not happen to be the case.
Kruttschnitt held on and was soon ap
pointed Harriman's assistant. It is ru
mored that he received the responsible
post through the influence of J. Pierpont
Morgan, whom he met here during Mor
gan's recent visit to the coast, and who
on his return to New York told Harri
man that Kruttschnitt was a most com
petent railroad man.
What Herrin's orders will be is causing
all sorts of conjectures, and his return to
San Francisco Is eagerly awaited. '

CALVE APPEARS
IN BIZET OPERA
Mme. Gadski Will Sing
Farewell To-Day at
Matinee. , .
Eames and Sembrich Appear
This Evening and End
the Season.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
The third Calve "Carmen" was given
last night at the Grand Opera-house, and
the immense audience found the singer
in yet another mood than on the previous
occasions. She had acquired somewhere
another cold, and sang all evening under
the cruellest difficulty. The capricious
Calve showed here a heroism that cannot
be too much admired, though the strain
on the sympathetic listener was almost
as severe as upon the brave singer. Those
hearing her last night got only the faint
est conception of the lovely voice, except
in the third act, where it came out with
something of its rich and rare beauty.
Neither was she at all herself otherwiseâ
naturally enough â though there were
flashes of the brilliant genius that have
before delighted in the part.
Â» She varied the detail of the role just as
before, with a matchless dramatic in
stinct, but the . performance as a whole
lacked fire, spirit and the magnificent
verve that only those who have seen her
Santuzza know her to possess in such
marvelous degree. It is a thousand shames
that this should have so happened. Tho
house that welcomed the singer was not
surpassed in numbers by any of the pre
ceding ones of the seasonâ an audience,
too, friendly, alert and prepared for ad
miration to its last unit. But the people
showed their sympathy with the singer
in friendliest fashion, applauding her to
the echo after each effort, and Calve de
served every note of applause that she
got. But they did not hear the Calve of
last Monday night, the vivid, gorgeous,
palpitant creature gifted vocally beyond
dreams, and acting' as no other actress
than Bernhardt has acted here. It is a
pity all round, for Calve and her audi
ence. She leaves for the East to-morrow.
The good wishes of every one who heard
her heroic effort of last night will go with
her, but such a strain as the singer sub
jected herself to is likely to leave its mark
for many silent weeks. One can only hope
not. â¢
Suzanne Adams came out strongly in
the part of Micaela,. The young Ameri
can is steadily improving in her work.
She is more plastic, freer and in every
sense broader than last year, and her
Micaela is among her most satisfying ef
forts. Salignac's Don Jose was full of
fireâ and tremolo, and Scottl"^ Escamillo
p)eases mildly, I cannot understand how
so accomplished and temperamental a
singer contrives to strain out of his con
ception of the toreador's role so much of
his characteristic spirit. Declery, as be
fore, was a wobbly Zuniga, and Gilibert,
Reiss, Miss Bauermeister and Mme. Van
Cauteren filled acceptably the remainder
of the cast. Flon conducted.
CALVE WI1TS MUCH SYMPATHY.
Diva Is Distressed During Her Fare
well Performance.
Calve, the famous songstress, is indeed
the victim of ill fortune. Last night, when
she made her farewell in "Carmen," the
Grand Opera-house was packed to the
very door3 and the diva unfortunately
was suffering from a relapse of the cold
that has played havoc with her voice.
â  Yet last week when she sang in "Caval
leria Rusticana" and gave a thrilling per
formance there was a "beggarly array of
empty seats" to greet her eyes.
The audience last night was as big as
the one that witnessed the performance
of "Le Nozzi di Figaro" last Monday af
ternoon, and dozens of men and women
were content to listen to the opera from
positions outside the swinging doors to
the theater.
When Calve first appeared it was no
ticed by all present that she was suffer
ing from a cold, and she repeatedly
coughed. She seemed in great distress,
and appealed mutely to the audience at
the end of her first song.
The response was one of sympathy.
From all over the theater came shouts of
applause that nerved the diva to her ar
duous task. She finished the act and was
recalled many times. Then a representa
tive of Manager Grau appeared before the
curtain and asked the indulgence of the
audience for Calve, who was singing in
order not to disappoint those 'who had
come to the theater.
Of course the indulgence was given In
California's well known style, and Calve
at times displayed some of the remarkable
ability that has thrilled the capitals of the
old and new worlds. Flowers in number
were thrown on the stage for the diva
and Scotti, Suzanne Adams, Salignac and
the rest of the cast were given hearty ap
plause.
With the performance of "TannhausÂ«r"
this afternoon and the repetition of "Le
Nozze di Figaro" to-night the brilliant
season of grand opera will come to an
end.
Madame Gadski, who has done superb
work during the season, will make hÂ«r
farewell this afternoon and will be heard
with Reuss-Belce, Bridewell, Dippel,
Blass, Bars, Muhlmann, Viviani and Bis
pham. There is a big sale of seats for
the "Tannhauser" presentation.
To-night is sure to be a gala one, for
"Le Nozze di Figaro" has been the hit
of the season. Eames and Sembrich wilt
say adieu to-night and De Reszke, Fritzl

. Trade Outlook.
PROSPECTS AS "VIEWED IN WALL
STREET.
Vbe New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Stock market speculate has been erratic
and uncertain. Some specialties scored fur
ther advances, while others reacted from high
tigures. and the entire market was more or
less adversely influenced by unfavorable de
velcpments connected with Amalgamated Cop
per. On the other hand, the remarkable
ctrength of the Vanderbilt shares and the be
lief that important steps were in progress
looking toward the consolidation of these prop
erties served as an important stimulant- Easy
money, cessation of gold exports and con
tinued good railroad earnings also served to
aid the manipulation lor higher prices.
Whether the present effort to create a bull
market will succeed or not we do not intend
to predict, there being much to be said on
both sides. With an abundant supply of loan
able lunds and continued prosperity. It may
he possible to carry the market to a higher
level considering that stocks are so highly
concentrated. No doubt' a strenuous effort will
be made to anticipate the January disburse
ments, which, will be very heavy and likely
10 aid such a movement. But. while it would
be folly to underrate the ability or the deter
mination of the big leaders to lift the market,
aid the fact that many conditions are in their
favor, it is also very necessary to remember
that circumstances are much . more contradic
tory than a year ago. Prices are already ex
ceedingly high, in niany cases the highest on
record. A number of stocks are selling not â¢
on what returns they do earn, but on what
returns they may earn, regardleEs of the fact
that the present wave of prosperity cannot
continue much longer without reaction. In
fact, it is a question whether prosperity has
not been nearly discounted. Money continues
very easy, partly owing to the return of funds
from the interior. Gold exports seem to have
l>een checked and the necessities of Europe
icaipcrarlly satisfied. A better supply of cot
ton bills also tended to check gold shipments.
London, however, is generally a seller on the
aMvancos in this marketand Europe Is neither
alile nor willing to enlarge its investments in
th'.s country. In view,, therefore, of the con
tinued shut-off in the supplies of gold from
Eouih Alrlca we are KtiU exposed to a demand
wm us for gold. Fortunately we are well
cble to supply this demand, so it need cause
no concern: only it is well to remember that
gold exports are net generally utilized aa hull
arguments. Our export trade continues to
chew ample trade balances, but exports hare
i:i several months fallen below last year's
heavy totals, and our Imports are steadily
rising. Adversity abroad and- prosperity at
home may seem very comforting, but such
conditions are not conducive to the large trade
tnalences which have been such a stimnlue
durine the last few years. In the present
f-ituatlon there is nrthing on which to build
any frri>at hope for higher prices. The latter
are already as hltrh as natural conditions war
rant, and, as said above, prosperity has been
amply discounted, while the effect of adverse
influences was warded off by artificial support
last summer. The market is still In very
powerful control; it is quite possible that .the
leaders, with unlimited resources behind them,
â with eary money and January disbursements
to come, and with the public imagination
easily fired by the great deals which are In
prepress, "tvjll be able to lift values to a etill
higher level. This will afford an excellent
baslft for trading; but we advise caution in
making purchases and (suggest profit-taking on
til pronounced rallies.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â The stock market open
ed with a firm tone to-day and gathered con
siderable strength during the course of the
day. The rise did not embrace the entire list,
however, and the exceptions to the strength
were among the very prominent stocks. One
stock or a group of stocks and then another
were taken up and lifted in price. The deal- j
ings in these active stocks were on a very !
large scale, but the aggregate of the day's !
dealings Indicates that the market was not I
very broad. The general sentiment among the
speculative community was one of satisfac
tion over the contents of the President's mes
sage and over t*-e tone of the comment on
that document in the press. The recommenda
tions of the Secretary of the Treasury look
ing to reform of the banking currency were
also viewed with satisfaction in the financial
district. The steadier tone of Amalgamated
<jopper removed an extremely disturbing in
fluence and was a potent factor, though a
negative one, in the strength of the market.
The trading continued to reflect hesitation,
while the course of this stock continued er
ratic, but when the firm support at about last
night's level was perceived the general tone of
the market became decidedly more confident.
The trading In Amalgamated Copper was still
on a very large scale. The stock nearly touch
ed the low record established yesterday for a
moment during the morning, but rallied
strongly during the latter part of the day and
closed with a net gain of 2%. The renewed
break in the London copper market was ig
nored. The fact that no engagements of gold
were made for export to-morrow served to re
lieve some apprehension that the money sup
plies would grow stringent by the drain to
that quarter. The banks have lost to the Sub-
Treasury this week upward of $5,000,000, Includ
ing the payments for the gold exported on
Tuesday. But the expected drafts for nearly
*4,ooo,ooo of Australian gold, of which the Sub-
Treasury was notified over a week ago, have
not yet been received. Application has al
ready been made for the withdrawal ofJ3,000,
000 of Government bonds on deposit to secure
national bank circulation, which is the maxi
mum allowed for the month. It Is evidently
intended to offer these bonds for redemption
The eagerness of the banks to withdraw these
bonds, and, in consequence, to reduce their
circulation, is evidence that the premium of
fered by the Government -for the redemption of
the bonds is the impelling motive rather than
the needs of the money market for additional
supplies. The monthly statement of the money
in circulation In the country by the Treasury
Department shows an increase of nearly
$3,000,000 during November, in spite of the
$18,C0O,CC0 of gold exports and a slight de
crease In the national bank circulation.
Anxiety over the money outlook was therefore
not in evidence to-day In spite of a deposit at
the .i^ b " TreafFUry for transfer to New Orleans
of $3aO,COO. The most notable points of strength
In the day's market were among the Gould
stocks, led by Manhattan, which rose an ex
treme 4%. This stock served as a leader. New
York Central was conspicuously strong, as was
Pennsylvania. General Electric rose 3%. There
wore many gains of 1 to 2 points in the South
westerns. Grand Trunk, coalers and indus
trials.. Notwithstanding the satisfaction pro
fessed over the "trust" paragraphs of the
President's message, 1 the transcontinental
stocks and United States Steel were laggards
in the advance. Great Northern preferred lost
l'/i and Northwest 6%, with a rally of 3 The
market closed slightly Irregular, but near the
top for many stocks.
Speculative bonds were strong, but there was
l5 r Si U n 1 ? n rity in the G ener al list. Total sales.
United States refunding 2s advanced % and
the 3s registered M per cent on the last call.

Chicago Grain Market.
Â« . *
CHICAGO, Dec. 4.â Speculation on the Board
of to-day was such as to recall the
great transactions of Hutchlnson, Cudahy,
Kent, Ream and the other giants who ruled
the pits and swung prices for fortunes every
session. Bull enthusiasm such as has not been
seen often" in late years had possession of the
markets, and in spite of heavy selling for
profits, every pit closed strong.
Transactions in wheat were on a scale that
indicated the Western country was thoroughly
aroused to the situation. The slight sag at
yesterday's close following the early buoyancy
attracted buyers everywhere. ' Both primary
and Northwestern receipts were reported rap
idly decreasing. The cable list did not re
spond to yesterday's sag and later cables
showed a marked improvement. Temptations
to take profits induced many holders to real
ize, but with the enthusiasm that seemed to
prevail 'on all hands early sellers soon became
the best buyers.' The countryman was prac
tically in control of the market. Outside mar
kets responded rapidly to every bullish incen
tive, and this strength was again reflected
here. Flour at Minneapolis advanced 10 cents.
Dry weather in the Southwest was reported
damaging to theâwinter crop and news was
constantly arriving that wheat was being fed
to stock. With all these Influences trade
showed a steady advance. . December opened
%c to %c up, sold to 75%@75%c and closed
strong, 1%@1%c. higher at 75%@75%c. May
opened %@%c to %@%c up and sold to 79%c,
closing strong, 1%@1%c higher at 79%c. - .-:
Corn lent its share of activity to the general
strength. The buying was of general charac
ter, with shorts covering and a good demand
present from the outside. Wheat activity in
fluenced this pit greatly and light receipts and
unsettled weather brought on a bull campaign.
Trade was not heavy, but the market was un
der a constant nervous strain. December
closed strong, 1%@1%c up, at 63%Â®63%c. May
sold to the new record price of 67%c and closed
strong, l%c higher, at 67c.
Oats had a strong bull market all session.
May sold to a new record at 45%c and closed
strong, 1%@1%c up, at 46@45%c.
A good country 1 demand for everything on
the provision list held hog products strong, to
gether with the strength in grains. January
pork closed 22%c up, lard 15c higher and ribs
10c up. â¢ -'

industrial interests that oil came to our rescue
this year and last. In its absence there would
have been a fuel famine, coal would have sold
at fancy figures and â numberless factories
would have been clcsad. which are running to

we have had a most seasonable rainfall, which

MARVELOUSLY ESCAPE DEATH
Two Explosions Occur, Causing Only One Fatality,
Even Man Leaning on "Mixer" Escaping. ,
BERKELEY, Dec. 4.â The gelatin
mixing house and guncotton
room of the Judson Dynamite
and Powder Company's works
en Cerritcs Hill, a mile north of
West Berkeley, were destroyed this aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock by two explosions,
v.hich occurred thirty seconds apart. OnÂ«
Chinaman was killed and two others in
jured. The foreman, George E. Miner,
had his face and hands severely cut and
his body bruised. Julius Roth, a work
man, was also cut and bruised- As . is
usual with such explosions, no one is able
to give the cause.
Two holes in the ground with splintered
timbers and twisted irons about show
the former location of the houses. A
<iirt bulkhead between the two buildings
was leveled. The debris caught fire and
it took the employes an hour to extin
guish the flames.
The explosion is remarkable for the
small loss of life it caused. Sixteen men,
white and Chinese, were r in or about the
buildings when the structures were
blown to fragments, and how all but one
man escaped the others are unable to tell.
That they all did not lose their lives is due
io the treak of explosions. Wonderful
c-scapes mere were, and the accident,
considering the wide nature of the de
struction, Is counted a "lucky" one
unicng men engaged in the dangerous
business of handling the high explosives
manufactured at the works.
The scene of the explosion is on the
north Bide of Cerritos, or McKeever s
hill, close to the swamp's edge. Three
buildings were built into the hhl with
bulkheads of dirt eight feet thick between
them. They were used in the manufacture
ct gelatin-dynamite. On the east was
the "stuffing" house, on the west the gun
cotton house and between these two the
mixing house. The west and center houses
were totally wrecked, while the third was
practically uninjured. L. N. Hoffman the
manager of the company, places the loss
of the two houses at $2000. This does not
include the damage to ether buildings
about the place, which will probably add
another $1000 to the total.
Mixer Explodes First.
According to Foreman Miner the
"mixer" exploded first. Miner was sitting
beside the huge bronze bowl with his
arm on its edge when the shock came.
His escape he deems nothing short of a
miracle. The dead Chinaman was In the
same house with Miner, but he seems to
have run in front of the guncotton house
and got the full effects of the second ex
plosion. His body was hurled thirty feet
across the swamp Into a ditch. It was
two hours after the accident before it
was discovered, a fellow-countryman nr.d
irg it The body showed slight evidence
of the force which threw it into the ditch.
The clothes were not even torn.
Four white men and twelve Chinamen
were in the danger district Miner, as
Ftated. was at the "mixer;" W. R. Edris.
the engineer, was at the boiler, not far
from Miner, and Julius Roth, a teamster,
and Frank Coster were in front of the
houses. The Chinamen were at different
points, most of them inside of the bull fl
ings. FvOth was driving a car and the
horse stood on the trac* in front of the
"stuffing" house, fifteen feet from the
rnatn w?eck. and received no injury. The
men fled in all directions after the first
explosion, to be thrown to the ground at
the second and heavier enock.
Foreman Miner's injuries consist of deep
gashes in his face and hands, caused by
f.ving glass, and body bruises. A piece cf
class an inch long cut the left cheek to

REVISIONISTS
CANNOT AGREE
Presbyterian Clergymen
Discover a Difficult
Task.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The wide di
versity of leaders of the Presbyterian
church on the subject of revision of the
creed was demonstrated when the com
mittee of twenty appointed by the Gen
eral Assembly to effect this work and
submit it to the next assembly began its
labors to-day. . It was found that none
of the members of .any sub-committee had
united upon any. report or statement. [, -
The committee held several meetings
during the day, all the proceedings being
in executive session. The full committee
began the work of framing the briof
statement of a doctrine this afternoon.
The present long creed of the church will
be considered article by article. The tiew
statement will now comprise about 1000
words. The committee's views are that
this statement should be composed of
about twenty paragraphs, and when rhe
session had concluded for the day only
one of these paragraphs had been agreed
upon. â 
It was said to-night that after the con
clusion of- the work of the committee-.at
.Washington â¢ statements â¢ agreed upon
would be printed, and would be again
considered by the committee at a-meet
ing to be held some time in the spring,
before the gathering of the General As
sembly, thus giving the members of the
revision committee opportunity to again
pass upon their work before it shall oe
submitted to the governing body- of the

works have already gained for him | rec

The great artist has been in this coun

the same steamer as Count Cassini and
his party, and since. his arrival in Wash

the embassy. A brilliant reception and
the first large function to be held here
this season- was given last Friday by
Count Cassini to introduce him and
Madame Makovsky to Washington " so

In Marlenbad last summer Makovsky
began a portrait of Countess Cassini. As
it was not completed then he brought it
with- him to this country, but though he
has been here some time, the red tape
connected with the: passage -of goods
through the New York Custom-house has
prevented him from getting this unfin

other portrait of the young Countess -
Makovsky is the court painter at St

Rear Admiral Crowninshield
Is Also Anxious td Disprove
' Charges' Against Him.
Special. Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, H06.G STREET,: N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. '. 4.âInvestiga
tion by Congress of the Navy Department
â¢will be â¢ welcomed by /Secretary Long. and
other naval officials.. The resolution in
troduced yesterday by'.-'. Representative
Williams, of Mississippi contemplating . a
fiilli -investigation of .the -war with Spain
will meet â â¢ with no opposition from naval
officers.' Secretary Long said to-day that
if Congress desires to investigate his de
partment he will be glad to facilitate .the
work of the committee appointed.
: Rear, Admiral .Crowninshield is also will
ing that Congress shall make inquiry into
his ccfliduct of the Bureau of Navigation.
He feels he has done nothing which will
not bear the closest insDection and his
friends are confidant that if a fair and im
partial . inquiry were made it would be
shown that' he. is entirely guiltless of the
charges of conspiracy against Rear Ad
miral Sehley and of alteration of depart
mental records, which have been made by
irresponsible persons. The investigation
made by the Dewey court established con
clusively, according to officials of the de
partment, the falsity- of these charges.
The Williams resolution calls specially
for an inquiry into the report that Rear
Admiral Crowninshield approved the
proof sheets of the Maclay book. It is
stated authoritatively that no- such ap
proval was ever given, in fact Rear Ad
miral Crowninshield did, not see Maclay's
work until it was in book form.
It is admitted at the Navy Department
that Maclay is still employed as a laborer
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Action has
not been taken in his case because the de
partment is awaiting the receipt of the
findings of the Dewey court. The find
ings are expected to be submitted within
the next week.
SINGLE TON OF. OEE
; - PAYS FOE THE MINE
Charles D.. Lane's Purchase cf the
Eureka Property Proves a Prof

TACOMA, Dec. 4.â Charles D. Lane's
luck has once more stood him in good
stead. According to news brought here
by James Cady, a mining man of Slate
Creek, one single ton of ore taken from
Lane's Eureka mine in the Slate Creek
district contained enough gold to more
than pay him for the cost of the property
He bonded the mine for $60,000 in 1S97 car
rying forward development work- which
showed that it would become an immense
producer. The development has pro
gressed winter and" summer, only enough
ore being taken out to keep a ten-stamp
mill in operation.' The main shaft is now
down more than 300 feet and numerous
levels and cross-cuts are being run. Next
summer additional hoisting machinery
will be put in and arrangements made to
keep sixty or eighty stamps in o'peration
The main ledge contains several very
rich pay streaks, from one of which waa
taken the ton of ore mentioned by Cady
The Eureka was . discovered in 1S93 and
first bonded to Marcus Daly, who let his
contract lapse..

TO BUILD MACHINE SHOP
Corporation Will Construct and
Equip Its Boiling Stock in Its
New Building.
The Eastern . owners j of the Market
street Railroad Company have in contem
plation the building of a machine shop in
the near future. The site selected for the
building is the corner of Utah and Twen
ty-fourth streets. During the past week
the lot has been used as a kind of crema
tory for the destruction of old horse cars
that were in use before the company se
cured the franchise for an electric service.
The antiquated cars were useless and
were stored in the carhouses. to the great
inconvenience of the men handling and
switching' the more modern rolling, stock.
As no one could be found to purchase
them, they were taken to the Utah-street
lot and burned for the iron they con
tained. . . .
When the new machine shop is erected
all of the company's cars will be con
structed and all of the â  repair 'work
will be done there. At present the repair
ing work is done in tho various carhouse-3"
while the heavier, work of equipping the
cars with motors is done on Kentucky
street. The cars have heretofore been
built at private establishments. The com

PEDIGREED DOGS AND FOWLS
POSE PROUDLY AT EXPOSITION
Oakland Show Opens Successfully and Promises to
Be Popular to the End.
IMPRESSIONS OF A- CALL CARTOONIST GAINED DURING AN AFTERNOON SPENT AT OAKLAND'S DOG
SHOW, LISTENING TO EXPLANATIONS OF THE POINTS OF AN ASSORTED LOT OF CANINES-PRIZE
WINNERS AND OTHERS-BY THEIR ADMIRING MASTERS: .
Dec. 4.â The Oakland
(I \V poultry, dog and pigeon show in
II ]| the Exposition building opened
to-day and fully justified all the
promises that have been made
for it. The poultry section, according^ to
H^nry Berrar of San Jose, one of thp
judges, holds the best exhibition ever
seen on this coast and one equal to any
thing ever held in America.
. Every class of high grade domestic fowl
is well and strongly represented, espe
cially in the case of the Barred Plymouth
Rock family. The incubator department
attracts considerable attention, especially
among the school children, who attended
the exhibition after school hours in
"while it is essentially a poultry show;
there is a fine collection of dogs. From
a noise standpoint the dogs constitute the
feature of the exhibition. All the 'birds
and most of the dogs were judged dur
ing the day. but the awards will not be
made public until to-morrow. ,
Probably the handsomest animal In 'the
show is the St. Bernard, Lester C, owned
by Charles Newman of San Francisco.
Le King, a St. Bernard entered by Phil
Meyer and the winner of many prizes in
the East, was Lester C's only formidable
competitor.
Lester C carried everything before him,
however, and- Newman's whoops of de
light outclassed the howling of the
noisiest dog by several octaves.
The show was largely attended during
the day and evening and promises to be
popular for the next three days.
The r>iqeon department is peculiarly in
teresting and includes birds from lofts
all over the State. The feature of the
pigeon exhibit is the runt class, which is
especially fine.
Prominent among the pigeon exhibitors
are A. B. Woods, W. S. Childs and C. B.
Jennings of Piedmont and Mortimer
Smith, Mrs. Blanche Knnx. A. Bormann.
C. J. .Siegfried and G. T. Marsh of San

1118 Broadway, Dec. 4.
Residents of the Lakeside district have
been warned by Chief of Police Hodgklns

existence of a plot "to do some wholesale
kidnaping. >. ' .
Chief Hodgklns reports that a few days

from a- woman whose identity he prom
ised not to reveal. The woman told him
that she had overheard two men dis
cussing a plan , involving the abduction
and holding for ransom of the children of
two Oakland families. . The woman told
her story with such" circumstantial 'detail
that the Chief immediately detailed De
tectives Shorey and Holland to

He also notified and placed on thoir
guard Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Thomson, who
reside at 117 Thirteenth street, and whose
child was one of the proposed victims of
the alleged kidnapers. The parents of thÂ«
other subject of conspiracy, whose iden
tity .tho Chief declines to divulge, were
also warned.
Every, police' officer in 'the city has been
instructed to be on the lookout for sus
picious characters and to watch particu
larly for strangers loafing in the vicinity
of the homes of wealthy, citizens.
Chief Hodgkins believes In the sincerity
of the woman upon whose information
he is now acting, and willleave nothing
undone to first of all prevent a successful
carrying out of this or similar plots, and
if possible to arrest the would-be kid
napers. -â "i â

MOTHER'S DEATH
BRINGS SUICIDE
Grief Causes Miss Nellie
McLerie to End Her
Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Dec. 4.
Long brooding over the death of her
mother so preyed upon the mind of Miss
Nellie McLerie, residing at 312 Church
street, San Francisco, as to cause her to
end her life last night at the home of
Mrs. Robert Dalziel. 522 Fifteenth street,
where the despondent, young woman was
a guest. Miss McLerie turned on the
gas in her bedroom, where she waa
found dead this morning by members of
the family, who discovered the strong
odor of escaping 'gas and made the lri
vestigation, which disclosed the suicide. -
The young woman had been subject to
fits of extreme depression and melan
cholia for several years. Her father,
Henry J. McLerie, a contractor of San
Francisco, had tried', many remedies to
meet his daughter's peculiar mental con
dition, but nothing had been of more
than temporary "avail.
Two weeks ago. In the hope that a
change might be beneficial. Miss McLerie
accepted the Invitation of Mrs. Dalziil,
an intimate family friend, to go to their
home in this city..
There was not a suggestion of the im
pending deed when Miss McLerie retired
last night.
Mrs. Dalziel said:
Nellie had been playing the piano and sing
ing shortly. .before she retired. The horror of
her taking oft ,tvas all the more terrible be
cause Ve had not the slightest* idea that this
was in her mind. She had realized her condi
tion, but had 'always struggled to fight off her
melancholy moods. Her - mind had not been
right since her mother's death.
Miss McLerie had made deliberate prep
aration for death, having stopped all the
openings and crevices in her. room aa
tightly i as possible. â¢ â : ;- â ; â¢ â  '
The Coroner has charge of the case.
The deceased was; 35 years of age, a na

To-day, when, injunction proceedings
to prevent his entering the cathedral
were called up In Judge Tully's court, it

Father Crowley would be dismissed at
the request of the church. Neither
Father ; Crowley nor his representative
were present, andr Attorney T. A.\Moran
said that 'Archbishop Feehan had not in
structed .him â¢ to withdraw the petition
for injunction^ The court continued the
case indefinitely, but stipulated that ? the
deposed priest was still under his oath
not to worship, in this parish.

Congress Is Furnished Fig
ures on Chinese Ex
clusion. ,
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Secretary of
the Treasury^ Lyman J. Gage â¢ to-day sub
mitted to Congress his latest annual re
port. It is a voluminous communication
and contains an abundance of informa
tion concerning the finances of the na
tion.
For the fiscal year the revenues of the
Government from all sources . were
$699,316,530 92, and the expenditures . for
the same period $621,598,546 54, showing a
surplus of $77,717,984 38. The Increase in
the receipts over the fiscal year 1900 was
529,721,099 74. and in the expenditures J22,
2^.56144.. The Secretary continues:
Commerce of the Nation.
The reserve fund and the trust fund have
been maintained. The redemptions of United
States notes have been each day adjusted by
exchange for gold, so that the full sum of
$150,000,0(0 has been kept unchanged in coin
and bullion. The coinage of the mints during
the fiscal year amounted to 176,999,132 pieces,
of a value of $136,340,781 58. â¢ Â±
â  Tha foreien commerce in merchandise for tha
fiscal, year 1W1 showed a decrease of $26,769,019
in imports and an increase of $93,281,909 in ex
ports when compared with the preceding year.
Comparing the figures of- 1901 with those of
1891, there is a decrease of $21,744,031 in im
ports and an increase of $803,284,131 in exports.
.The imnorts of the year 1901 were $S23,172,16i
and' the exports $1,487,764, 991, making the ex
cess of exports over Imports $664,692,826.
The record of exports of manufactures in
1891 shewed a slight decrease, amounting to
$21,696,690 when compared with 1900, but an
increase of $72,562,920 over 1899, and exceeded
the imports of manufactures In 1901 by $89.
026,766. " ,
In the matter of Chinese exclusion the
Secretary says: /.{J^
. Under the provisions of the treaty and laws
in relation to the exclusion of Chinese, the
Oommisslonar General reports that 2735 regis
tered Chinese laborers have departed from the
ports of this country during the year and 2280
have been admitted upon their return.
Of the exempt classesâ "Chinese subjects,
being officials, teachers, students, merchants
or travelers for curiosity or pleasure" â and of
those deslrinsr to â  pass through ''the United
States to foreign countries, there were 4509
applications. Of the 2702 claiming to be ex
cepted by the provisions of the treaty 1784 were
admitted, and the remainder, 918, were de
nied admission. The frequent abuse of the
privilege of passing through to foreign coun
tries necessitated the issue of more stringent
regulations to establish the good faith of ap
plicants therefor, and the use of photographs
la recommended in all cases to verify the Iden
tity of persons holding papers of any kind is
sued under authority of law or regulation.
Defects in Exclusion Law.
Legislation is recommended by. the. Commis
sioner General to define more narrowly the
term "merchant," as well as to prescribe con
ditions, corresponding to those with which this
class cf Chinamen has to comply, for the ad
mission of merchants' wives and minor chil
dren. For the purpose of enabling the admin
istrative â  of fleers to investigate thoroughly the
veracity of statements as to circumstances oc
curring In China, upon which claims to ad
mission . to this country are based, additional
legislation also is recommended.
The report further shows that Chinese per
sons who have been refused admission at ports
of - entry on the Candian boundary as mem
bers of one of the excepted classes subse
quently cross the border and are arrested and
carried before judicial' officers upon their
claim of having been born In this country.
The tctal number of those deported during the
year under Judicial decisions was 328, and the
cost of executing; the mandates of the courts
for their deportation amounted to $46,940 44. ' ;
I The laws relating to the exclusion of Chinese
expire by "limitation on May 5, 1902. The re
enactment of these laws, either as they now
stand or with modifications, â¢ furnishes an im
portant' subject for investigation and appro
priate action by Congress. If the laws should
be renewed, or their provisions extended, the
department would be pleased to furnish a
statement covering certain administrative bet
terments â  suggested by experience In their en
forcement.
. Of the appropriation of $160,000 for the ad
ministration of the Chinese exclusion laws,
there was expended for salaries and expenses
of officers $110. 4S2 35: deportation of prisoners,
$46,940 44: miscellaneous expenses, $3261 88;
total, $160,684 67, leaving a deficit of $684 67.
â¢ The report has this to say about re
duction in revenue:
Repeal of Some Taxes
Congress must be the final judge as to what
particular objects of taxation and in what de
gree reduction in rates shall apply. In my
opinion it would be within conservative limits
to reduce revenue to the extent of $50,000,000.
As a first step in that direction I. recommend
for consideration the repeal of all the miscel
laneous taxes known as war taxes. These
Items (exclusive of the Increased tax on fer
mented liquors, tobacco, tea and mixed flour)
are estimated to produce $27,500,000. They are
in â  their nature vexatious, in some instances
oppressive and separately considered yield but
small revenue. . <
In conclusion Secretary Gage says:
It would, then, appear that the present is the
most propitious hour in. all. our history and
as favorable a one as we may hope for in the
future, to enter upon judicious measures to
eliminate sue]] elements of financial weakness
as experience has brought into view and to
perfect. If possible, our now imperfect system
of currency. | Careful reforms are to be desired;
revolutionary measures are to be feared. In
the direction toward better conditions in bank
ing and currency the attention of Congress is
earnestly invited. - â  â  < â  - â  â

WITTMAN WILL
STOP GAMBLING
Police Make a Raid on
Nickel-in- the - Slot
Machines.
Those That Pay in Checks
or Coin Will Be
Destroyed.
Chief Wittman has determined to put a
stop to all sorts of gambling prohibited
by.law, and' to that end has inaugurated
a vigorous policy of suppression. \ He
started by stopping the selling of pools
by cigar dealers, and followed that up by
stopping all turkey raffles, as he discov
ered that they were made a cloak for
gambling, pure and simple.
Now he has turned his attention, to
nickel in the slot machines which pay in
checks redeemable by coin at the bar or
In nickels. It came to his knowledge that
numbers of boys and young men played
these machines in saloons and corner gro
ceries and he detailed two officers in plain
clothes to procure evidence in the mat
ter. The result was that twelve warrants
were sworn out in the Police Courts yes
terday for the arrest of saloon men and
grocers who have been violating the law
in this regard. ' â  .
The Chief contends that he has the
power under the charter to destroy these
machines. To make assurance doubly
sure he sent a letter to District Attorney
Byington requesting his opinion on the
matter and has received the following re
ply:
Replying to your communication of Novem
ber 30 1901, requesting my opinion on section 5,
chapter 3, page 102 of the charter, ."regarding
powers of Board of Police Commissioners rela
tive to the destruction and sale of property In
possession of property clerk," I would
state that- It seems clear from said
provision that it was the intent of the charter
to give to the Board of Police Commissioners
power to order the destruction of all imple
ments, weapons, or any other article, matter
or thins used In the commission of crime.
The Chief said yesterday
I shall, In view of that opinion, destroy all
these machines, as they have been used in the
commission of crime. They cost $250 each, I
believe, and the loss will be considerable. I
have an order here for the return of a ma
chine, signed by Judge Cabaniss, -but I will
not honor it. The machine was seized In a sa
loon at 433 Dupont street, and the proprietor,
S. Kanl, a Japanese, was convicted by the
Judge. Any saloonkeeper who has one of these
machines will be brought before the Commis
sioners to show cause why his license should
not be revoked for allowing gambling on his
premises. Boys play these machines and lose
considerable money, and I am determined to
suppress them.
! Those arrested on a charge of maintain
ing the machines are: Henry George
Hayes, grocer, 598 Geary street; George
Wobber, clerk in Claussen's grocery, 40$
Geary street; H. Schroeder, grocer, 501
Jones street, and D. Fagothey, grocer,
Jones and Turk streets.
Last evening the police arrested Dennis
Fagothy, Charles Shakefield, James Fer
guson and George Gibt> and charged them
with violating the nickel-in-the-slot ordi
nance.
SAIUffAKEB LEONG NOT
GUILTY OF SMUGGLING
Commissioner Heacock Does Not
Think There Is Sufficient Proof :
to Hold Him for Trial.
Leong How, Chinese sailmaker on the
steamship Doric, was examined yesterday
by "United States Court Commissioner
Heacock on a charge of smuggling and.
against the contention of United States
Attorney Wood worth, was discharged
from custody. He was taken in charge
by the Custom-house officials and placed
in the detention shed in the Mail dock
for deportation to China.
Commissioner Heacock ruled that \ no
evidence had been introduced to show
that Leongr had landed the smuggled
goeds or had assisted in their being land
ed. It had been proved that Leong
brought a quantity of silk and silk caps
frcm China to this port in the Doric and
sold them to Joseph Alexander. The buy
er concealed the goods on his person and
was arrested by customs officers as soon
as he reached the wharf. Woodworth is
of the opinion that Leong by bringing the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALiti, THURSDAY, BECEMBER 5, 1901.
L ADY TEACHERS UNFITTED
FOR DUTY IN PHILIPPINES
So Says Congressman Weeks, Who -Gives
Opinion of Conditions. in the Islands.
ONGRESSMEN Edgar Weeks, of
ff^ f Michigan and D. A. de Armorid of
(I . Missouri: were among the arrivals
yesterday on the transport Han
t cock from Manila. After leaving
the dock they went immediately to * the
California Hotel, and left last evening for
the East. - \ ...
Both Representatives have collected a
great amount of material which they
feel assured will be of much benefit to
them while discussing the Filipino ques
tion in Congress. Mr. Weeks said, when
asked about conditions in the islands: ;
There is a popular idea that the Philippines,
are over-populated. This is a m'stake. There
are thousands of acres of fine land that has
never been touched by either plow or hoe. This
land would produce splendid coffee. ' A poor
man should not go to the islands, as there is
no field for him. The price of labor is cheap
and will always be so on account of the cli
mate. The natives themselves can only work a
portion of each day. During the hot weather
they have -to lay off several hours in a day,
or they .would be prostrated by the heat
250,000 Wild Morros.m Jungles.
In my tour of the islands I found that the
towns and villages are all built near the coast.
In the interior, only a few miles from the
beach the land Is covered by a dense Jungle.
In these jungles 250,000 Morros live. They are
of the Mohammedan faith and have never
been ruled or conquered by any nation. Spain
did not rule them and the United States will
be a lone time bringing them to observe the
law. They don't want any religion but their
own. They ask to be allowed to follow their
own religion and declare if their request is
granted they will not interfere with the white
men.
I was only thirty-five miles from the scene of
the massacre of Company C of the Ninth In
fantry. During our tour we took many des
perate chances of being caught The Govern
ment Is putting more ginger Into its way of
ruling the natives, and that Is the only way to
get along with them. The Filipinos cannot be
taught to love a government, but when they
â¢are afraid they obey the laws. â¢*
The question of the Sultan of Sulu and his
harem is a very email matter when you are
confronted with the great questions that are
now Involved. The Sultan lives in a dirty,
tumbled-down house and he may have several
wives but he Is a very Insignificant Individ
ual. I do not fear any trouble with him.
Thinks Aguinaldo Not Intelligent.
I saw Aguinaldo and spent half a day with
him. He Is not an intelligent man, and' I think
feels that he Is inferior in intellect to the
Americans. He is a peculiar man, and after
meeting him you are impressed with the idea
that he Is a very foolish person, or that, he
wants you to believe he is. He seemed to me
to be wearing a mask and was not clever, but
cunning. We exchanged photos,- but I do not
believe that his display of friendship was sin
cere. The general opinion among the military
men is that Aguinaldo should be allowed to
escape. He ie a dead Issue and is no longer a
menace to the United -States. It is supposed
that he does not want to run away, as he
would at once be assassinated by the friends
of General Luna. He ordered that General
Luna be killed and the deceased soldier's
friends' will kill him the first opportunity In
revenge. .
The new method of educating the natives,
as adopted by this Government, Is wrong.
Refined, handsome young ladles from Vassar
and other colleges went down to the Philip
pines to educate these natives. They were dis
tributed among the islands, some of them ( be-

ing put in villages that were merely composed
of shanties. They have had to put up with
all kinds of privations and to eat native food,
and In eome places their lives haVe been in
danger. I think this is entirely | unnecessary.
In place of these young ladies, discharged sol
diers of education, who had , become acclimat
ed, should be, appointed and the young ladles
should be sent home. : . . â  . 'â  ..
EELIGIOXTS LESSONS NOT
FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Professor T. B. â¢ Dresslar of the Uni
versity of California delivered a lecture
last night at St. Luke's' Church on
"Teaching in the Sunday School." In the
course of- his address he said:
It Is not . the function I of public schools In
this country to give expression. to religious be
liefs. This must be left to other agencies. Be
cause of this some have said that public schools
are antl-rellgious.- Nothing Is more untrue.
Our public schools are simply secular.
If the people of this nation are to receive
religious Instruction they must get It outside
the public school. If the church could shift
its responsibility in respect to the religious
teaching of children it would have no need of
the gospel. The best possible thing for the
church is this responsibility, -which should not
be shifted.
It Is Just as necessary that children should
have religious education as they should know
arithmetic. It is as much a part of their
nature.
THINKS WRECK
HAS BEEN FOUND
Searching Party Strikes
Sunken Object Near
Arch Rock.
Divers to Go Down To-Day to
Ascertain if It Is the
San Rafael.
The California Wrecking Company
thinks it has located the wreck of the
steamer San Rafael. Early yesterday
morning Captain H. J. Rogers took out
the launches Amy, Nina and Wm. D. Tha
Amy and Nina were fastened together by
a* long towing line, while a huge drag
was let down between. The Amy carried
the wreckers and a big load of -anchors
and rope, so the Wm. U was fastened to
her in order to prevent her, drifting too
fast with the tide.
A start was m,ade from off the fog bell on
Alcatraz Island, about 10 a. m. â¢ When the
boats were near Arch Rock they were
brought up with a jerk. An investigation
showed that something foreign to the lo
cality had been struck and every attempt
to raise the drag failed. The wreckers
concluded that they had located the re
mains of the San Rafael and anchored
the Amy over it. To-day a diver will go
down and . make an investigation.
Captains Bolle3 and Bulger, United
States Local Inspectors of Steam Vessels,
will begin at 1 o'clock this afternoon an
Investigation into the collision between
the San Rafael and the Sausalito.
A boat from the San Rafael was picked
up at the quarry on Angel Island yester
day. It is not badly damaged and evi
dently brokje adrift from the lashings
when the steamer went dawn.
OLD DICK
SURVIVES
THE WRECK
DICK, the faithful old black
horse of the North Pacific
Coast Railroad Company,
,that was supposed to have
gone down with the ill
fated steamer San Rafael, has
turned up safe and sound. This
news will, not only be pleasing
but gratifying to the hundreds of
commuters who have fed the
horse during the trips across the
bay. . . s.
During all the excitement at
tendant on the , wreck of the
steamer last Saturday night Dick
seemed oblivious to danger. He
might have gone to the bottom
with the steamer had not Captain
McKenzie liberated him. As stat
ed in an interview with a Call
representative on the night of the
wreck, Captain McKenzie said he
took a good look through the
cabin and even went below t and
cut the halter rope that held' the
freight horse.
"I tried to lead him toward the
deck," said Captain McKenzie,
"but he balked. There was not
much time to lose, so I Just got
him started so he could have a
chance to get overboard when the
steamer sank. . I don't know
whether Dick got into the water
â¢or not, but when I left the San
Rafael there was not a single
passenger aboard the sinking
steamer."
It Is evident the faithful animal
did go overboard, and its instinct
caused it to swim toward the
nearest land. This was Alcatraz
Island. A dispatch was received
from San j Rafael yesterday stat
ing that the horse was found
peacefully grazing on the island.

CTJSTOM-HO1JSE WEIGHER
SWAIOJOWS CHLOROFOBM
Friend Believes That He Took tho
Drug Through Mistaking It
for a Sleeping Potion.
Frank L. Klbbey, assistant weigher at
the Custom-house, was taken to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital shortly before
midnight last < night suffering from an
overdose of chloroform, taken Internally.
From the circumstances surrounding the
case It Is quite probable that Kibbey ac
cidentally took the dose that may end
his life. L He went on a spree yesterday
morning, and. about 6 o'clock last even-
Ing, when he got ready to go home, he
went into . the â  Baldwin drug store and
purchased some -chloroform, which he
said he | intended to use in . cleaning silk.
He changed his mind about going home,
however, and together with a friend
named Jim Little visited the Oberon and
several places. ' The liquor overtaxed
Klbbey* b nerves and he went to a physi
cian, who prescribed a sleeping draught.
Then Klbbey hired a room In an Ellis
street lodging-house, and it is supposed
that he accidentally drank the chloroform
instead of the sleeping draught.

CHINESE ESCAPE
FROM MAIL DOCK
Seven Climb Through the
Skylight of the De- â¢
tention Shed.
. Seven Chinese Immigrants In transit
escaped from the detention shed on the
Mail | dock last Tuesday night and were
recaptured some time afterward by cus
toms inspectors.
The Chinese climbed ' out of the room
through the skylight with the assistance
of a rope ladder furnished by. some per
son on the outside. The escape was not
detected until half past 10 o'clock, when
Government Watchman T. T. Brown
gave the alarm. Lieutenant Edward Dur
kin and Inspector J. T. Stone of the Cus
tom-house force and two watchmen em
ployed by J the ' Pacific Mall Steamship
Company went on the roof of the Mail
dock and after a thirty-nunute search
among the coal tramways and barbed
wire fences captured six of the fugitives.
The other was caught at a quarter after
1 o'clock yesterday inornJng by Lieuten
ant Edward Durkin and Puiiceman J. J.
Murphy. The Chinaman was hiding be
hind some old lumber in an alleyway used
as a thoroughfare to and from the Ori
ental wharf, more than hail a block from
the detention shed.
The outbreak was reported to the
watchmen by Chan Gum Tong; who
claims to be a merchant of Fresno ra
turning after a visit to his native land.
The remaining Chinese in the detention
shed threatened to cut his throat for hav
ing given the alarm, and the customs of
ficials took him out and kept him under
guard so that his life might not be In
danger.
One of the fugitives Is & Chinaman re
turning to Salt Lake, and the others are
in transit toÂ» Mexico. Before climbing
through the skylight the Chinese put
on their best clothes and filled their pock
els with clean stockings. One of the num
ber had tried to escape on a previous oo
casion.
The Chinese Bureau will make a vigor
ous investigation of the escape, especial
ly with a view to finding out how the Chi
nese got the rope, and for the purpose
also of discovering the parties through
-whose negligence the escape was mats
possible. â¢â  '.}
