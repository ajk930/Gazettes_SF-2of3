LOUISVILLE. Ky.. Nov. 11.â Newell C.
Rathbun, who was supposed to have 'died
%in a Jeffersonville, Ind., hotel last Thurs
day, was arrested in Louisville to-day.
According to Rathbun the corpse that
was shipped to Little Rock for burial a-s
the body of Rathbun was the body of
"W. L. Teneyeke. The police pay Rathbun
has confessed to desertion from the
United States army and to having formed
a plan to fraudulently collect $4000 insur
ance on his life, but that he denied hav
ing killed the man who died in the Jeffer
eonville Hotel. Rathbun was arrested
about 11 o'clock this morning: at the
United States receiving station in Louis
. ville, where he had Just enlisted under
the name "Lou Root. Detroit. " He is held
as a fugitive from justice. Rathbun made
a' statement, in which he said: -
"I came to Louisville about ten days
ago and formed a plan to make the in
surance company think I was dead, bo
that I could collect the Insurance. I fell
in with a man who said his name was
W. L. Teneyeke in front of the Salvation
Army headquarters in Louisville and toM
him of my plan, and he agreed to help
me. Our plan was to obtain a corpse from
some place, put in a hotel in Jefferson
ville and then set fire to the hotel. While
we were in Jeffersonville we took a num
ber of drinks and Teneyeke got drunk. I
think his death was caused by drinking. I
put the letters addressed to me in hi*
pockets and left. I did not kill him. I
then came to Louisville and went to the
recruiting office and enlisted."
The police are trying to establish thÂ»
Identity of the dead man. One of their
theories is that he was a tramp whom
Kathbun had fallen in with.
Coroner Coots of Jeffersonville says he
examined the stomach of the dead man
and found traces of enough laudanum to
kill two men. .' Â¦'::: :\ r /;

NEW TREATY
WILL SOON

Paving Way for Isth
mian Canal.
Senators Assure the President
That Ratification Is Not
to Be Opposed.
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â The signa
ture of the isthmian canal treaty negoti
ated by Secretary Hay and Lord Paunce
fote will occur as soon as the latter shall
receive the necessary powers from London.
These will come by cable and will formally
authorize the Embassador, as represen
tative of King Edward, to attach his
name to the instrument. It is the expecta
tion of the authorities here that the treaty
will be signed within the next few days.
All the members of the Isthmian Canal
Commission are in the city for the pur
pose of attending the final sessions, which
begin to-morrow. The present gathering
is to complete the report of the commis
sion and report, in accordance with law,
the route for an interoceanic canal by
way of the isthmus. The law under which
the commission was appointed requires it
to name a route; if it fails it will fall
short of its duty, to perform which Con
gress voted $L 075.000, all of which has been
spent. The commission, if it does not
make a recommendation, will also be
charged with playing into the hands of the
Panama company. It is believed that the
commission will name the Nicaragua
route as best for the United States and
eliminate the Panama route as imprac
ticable, owing to the inability or indis
position of the Panama company to make
an offer to transfer its property to this
Government. Sentiment In Congress is
overwhelmingly in favor of the Nicaragua
route.
The preliminary report made public last
December placed the cost of the Panama
route at $146,000,000. It gave the cost of
the Nicaragua Canal as $200,000,000. In both
instances theÃe figures will be changed a
few millions. The commission thinks the
final surveys of Nicaragua show that
route much better than they thought it
would be when they signed the prelim
inary report.

Abduction of Miss
Stone.
Liberation cf Captives in
Order Before Demand for
Reparation.

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.-While the
United States is determined to hold Bul
garia to a strict account for the part she
played in the abduction of Miss Ellen M.
Stone, President Roosevelt and Secretary
Hay are not prepared to Initiate action
contemplating reparation until Miss Stone
shall have obtained her liberty. Conse
quently the representation made by Con
sul General Dickinson to the Bulgarian
Government that it will be held responsi
ble, while premature, expresses accurate
ly the view of this Government. It Is re
iterated with positiveness that Secretary
Hay is bending all his efforts to secure
the liberation of Miss Stone, and when
this is accomplished a demand for in
demnity will be submitted and pressed.
Dickinson's conduct of negotiations with
the Bulgarian Government has caused the
State Department considerable embar
rassment. In his effort to prevent the
Sofia authorities from dispatching troops
in pursuit of the brigands he has been
heartily supported by the department.
Dickinson has protested agalnÃt the pub
lication of facts in relation to the ne
gotiations, which he says are cabled to
Sena, but it is pointed out that he him
self authorized statements even more em
barrassing than those to which he ob
jects., Eddy, secretary of the legation at
Constantinople, has, on the other hand
displayed considerable diplomatic ability
in dealing with this delicate question and
the authorities are gratified at the course
he has pursued.
SOFIA, Nov. 11.â From another letter
that has been received from Miss Ellen
M. Stone, the abducted American mis
siccary.it appears that she is enduring
the trials of her hard experience with
fortitude, forgetting herself in her anx
iety for her companion, Madame Tsilka.
Miss Stone does not dare to complain "of
the treatment to which they are sub
jected, but she ftnds the confinement irk
some and the weather extremely trying.

the thousands who formed the audience.

crowd surrounded the Grand Opera-hous-i

gayly dressed occupants commenced to
arrive. The police regulations called for
all carriages to enter Mission street from
Third street, and by 7:30 there was a Mm
of vehicles reaching up to Market street
and along tha*t artery for two blocks.
The large foyer of the Grand Opera
house was turned into a temporary re
ception-room for an hour previous to the
curtain ascending, for the members of so

take note of. what dresses were worn.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1901.
EAMES, AS THE BEAUTIFUL ELSA, WINS
HER AUDIENCE WITH OPENING NOTE
"Lohengrin" Serves as the Happy Medium for the Introduction of
New Stars and Some Former Favorites, Van Dyck, Schumann-
Heink, De Reszke and Bispham Receiving Prompt Recognition
CERTAINLY Mr. Grau has no reason to complain of the
welcome San Francisco has given to his singers this
season bo far. The Grand Opera-house was, a sight of
sights last night. Not a vacant seat anywhere to be
seen, but a flashing, glittering, colorful, cheerful crowd
of folk, there to give worthy welcome to the best the world can
Jffer in the operatic line. It was an enthusiastic houseâen
thusiastic for the singers, for the opera, for the orchestra and
above all for Walter Damrosch, who was called twice before
the footlights to acknowledge the prolonged applause. Gra
cious also was the greeting 1 to Mme. Emma Eames, who made
her first appearance here as Elsa, for the opera was "Lohen
grin," and to all the favorites of last yearâ Van Dyck.^Schu
mann-Heink,, De Reszke and Bispham, who never sang better
than they did last night. It was a house determined to be en
thusiastic, and the keyi.ote of appreciation for the grand opera
has been struck for the year. There will be no necessity this
season for the critic to insist seven times a week that Mr.
Grau has something that is worth hearing down at the Gran-i
Opera-house. The public settled the question for themselves
last night and the opera's the thing.
I have heard better beginnings than the opening act of
"Lohengrin" last night, the general unrest and excitement of
the occasion" seeming rather to communicate itself to the sing
ers, or rather to prevent the needed "atmosphere" from mak
ing itself as quickly felt as usual.
But the performance rose to a magnificent level In the
second act, and the love > scene in the third act was adorably
beautiful. The chief interest of the evening naturally cen
tered in the appearance of Mme. Emma Eames, third of the
great Elsas who have been heard here, her rivals of last year,
Nordica the brilliant and the lovely Gadski. Eames is neither
one nor the other, but herself wholly. She has a voice that
reminds of Melba's, pure as a pearlâ and as cold, I was tempted
to believe in the beginning of the evening. But later the
singer warmed to her work, and it was indeed a beautiful
maiden of Brabant that sang her song of love and doubt to
Lohengrin in the bridal chamber.
Mme. Eames' voice is almost as pure as the crystalline pure
voice of Melba, and true and fine as a bird's note. She sings
with a cool and delicate art that delights even more in the
memory than in its first hearing and acts in a gracious, grace
ful fashion. She is a beautiful woman, eminently graceful in
with cable, tails and Parma violets. Orna
ments, pearls.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON
movement and her costumes, designed by Ijer husband. Julian
Story, are garments set to music.
Van Dyck, usually a little cold as he first comes upon the
stage, last night immediately gripped his audience. His Lohen
grin of last year is well remembered, every note of it, but he
can do, is doing better work this year. His voice is in excel
lent shape, clear, noble, round, as we have before known it.
and his virile actUig of the part reminds anew that he is one
of the very few p*ect singers who can act as well as sing. He
looks the Silver Knight so royally, too, like one of the quaint
young dreams that flew away when the fairies vanished out of
one's life, since when the world has never seemed quite the
same place. Altogether Van Dyck is one of the most satisfy
ing and brilliant ligures of the season.
Another who satisfies completely is that luscious, vital
singer, Schumann-HeMnk, whose Ortrud is a magnificently im
passioned effort. All through the long first scene she stands
silent, every line of her figure breathing her mimic hatred
for the maid of Brabant, helpless seeming, before her. Then
come the few wonderful, glowing notes at the end, and with
them a splash of warm gold through the web of sound the or
chestra and chorus are weaving. Schumann-Heink's voice just
â¢'hits you where you live"â to put the teeling into prose; it is
so full of richness, life, warmth, tfhe is a compelling creature;
one must look at her, feel with her, follow her all the time she
is en the state, and miss her when she goes
Ortrud is her best part, so far as I know her repertoire,
but one could hear it every night in the week and still wait
breathlessly for those thrilling, warm-blooded notes of hers.
Schumann-Heink has a new gown, too, in the wedding scene,
second act, and I don't like it. Against the pearly- grace of
Mr. Story's designs the somewhat garish splendor of Ortruds
festal gown comes off badly. It is a ridiculously small mat
ter, of course, but such things do count in the picture.
De Reszke was the king of the evening. His voice also is
as noble as ever and his splendid figure adds a royal grace to
the picture.
Mr. Bispham's Telramund was quite up to his conception
of last year, his acting as careful and distinguished and his vi
brant voice as well and dramatically used. Mr. Muhlmann was
the herald to admiration, and the orchestra and chorus was
amply satisfying. To-night "Les Huguenots," with an all
star cast, will be given, and we are thus fairly and gloriously
launched into the grand opera season.

The many hundreds of superbly gowned
women were the feature of the first nigat
of the present opera season. One of tn-2

was almost tilled and presented a " X ;
ing appearance. The somber-hued garb or
â¢ the men served to accentuate the rich col
ors of feminine dress. Outer wraps that
had hidden the gowns on entering tni
theater had been removed, and the crea
tions of the modistes were displayed in
all their wealth. â .
Row upon row and tier upon tier showed
every variety of color In silks and satin.
The glow of electric lights was caught
by thousands of priceless gems that glis
tened on the arms and necks of the fair
wearers. In every direction in the big
theater the eye was dazzled by the kalied
oscopic hues of gowns and the flashing of
jewels, displayed as a tribute to the vo
taries of song, who last night made their
bow to a San Francisco audience.
Triumph of Mme. Emma Eamei.
The "Lohengrin" overture was lis
tened to attentively, and there was but
little of conversation that usually is heard
at a fashionable gathering on a grand
opera opening night.
Mme. Emma Eames won instant recog
nition as Elsa, and she charmed her audi
ence completely. The rest of the cast was
heard last season, but Mme. Eames scored
a triumph. When the curtain went down
on the first act the entire cast was re
called many times, and a thunder of ap
plause greeted the singers. Shouts of
"bravo!" filled the air, and men and
women vied In greeting the artists. Di
rector Damrosch was called to ( the stage
and shared in the ovation.
Between the acts the lobby and foyer
were crowded by hundreds of the mem
bers of the audience. Visits were paid to
friends in the boxes, and the topic of dis
cussion was the success of the singers.
Each act of the opera was heard with
rapt attention, and when the last note had
sounded and the performance ended the
audience dispersed. Many suppers were
given at fashionable resorts, and at an
early hour this morning society was
whirled homeward to dream later on of
the gala opening of the grand opera sea
son.
An extra detail of firemen was sent to
the opera-house by Chief Sullivan, and
with the police officers watched alertly
over the safety of the audience.
San Francisco placed itself on record
last night and gave to the grand opera
company as distinguished and brilliant an
audience as it could desire. .

CHARGED WITH FRAUD
IN OIL LANDS DEAL
Former Receiver of Visalia Land
Office and a Sakersfield
Printer Indicted.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 11.â E. A. PuÂ«9
chel of this city, formerly receiver of thÂ«
United States Land Office at Visalia, haÂ«
been indicted by the Federal Grand Jury,
now sitting at Fresno, for conspiracy in
connection with the affidavits regarding
the character of the land of the Kern
River oil district. Frederick G. Maid, a
printer here and formerly in Pueschel'3
employ, has been indicted for perjury on
two separate counts. The bail in each
instance has been fixed at 15000.
The Grand Jury in Los Angeles a year
ago indicted both men on the same
charges, but the indictments were subse
quently quashed on the ground that the
Grand Jury sitting at that point had no
jurisdiction. A reinvestigation by the
Federal body at Fresno resulted in simi
lar charges being brought. The warrants
were served this evening.

IN NEGOTIATIONS
Railway Magnates Differ
Over Northern Pacific
Settlement.
Unexpected Difficulties Met
in Financing Burling
ton Road.
NEW YORK, Nov. ILâ The Mall and Ex
press says: The delay in the announce
ment cf the terms of the Northern Pacific
settlement, it was learned to-day, is due
to the inability so far to agree upon the
details for the control of the Burlington
and the surrender of the Northern Pacific
. preferred stock owned by the Union Pa-
V me. â¢
This is the ground for the current re
port that there had been a hitch in the
deal, and it caused a considerable selling
of Union Pacific stock. When it was an
nounced that the main points of agree
ment had been settled, reference was
made only to the decision of Messrs. Hill
and Morgan to give up a half-interest in
the Burlington to the Union Pacific and
to permit the retirement of Northern Pa
cific preferred stock.
In their efforts to determine how the
Burlington should be financed they met
with unexpected difficulties, although it
was agreed by both sides, it is said, that
a proprietary company should be organ
ized for this purpose, as well as another
proprietary company for the Great North
ern and the Northern Pacific. There was
a disposition on the part of the Union Pa
cific to surrender its Northern Pacific
stock in exchange lor shares in a new
proprietary company, but members of the
Harriman syndicate objected to paying a
large amount of cash for a one-half inter
est in the Burlington.
The price of $200 a share was thought to
be too large, and if all cash were paid for
the Burlington it would mean an outlay
of $200,000,000, which was entirely different
from what the Harriman people had in
mind.
It was said to-day that the most likely
way out of the difficulty would be the sur
render of the Union Pacific holdings of
Northern Pacific in exchange for an in
terest in the Burlington. The former are
about $77,000,000. par value, and are said
yE.\e cost something more than that
:lgure.
But if the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern accepted the exchange the
Northern Pacific Company would be buy
irg its own stock. It is believed that the
two proprietary companies will afford a
method of getting out of this dilemma,
but at the moment things are â¢ not pro
gressing very rapidly.
TREATY WITH DENMARK
NOT YET A CERTAINTY
New Ministry Is Not Well Disposed
Toward Cession of Danish West
Indies.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â The project
ed treaty of cession of the Danish West
Indies to the United States is not so weil
advanced as it was hoped would be the
case at this time. It is now doubtful
Â¦whether the treaty will be completed in
time to submit to Congress when it rts.s
t-' mbles next month. The delay appears
10 have arisen through the change in the
Ministry at Copenhagen, the State De
partment practically having reached an
agreement with the Danish Government
on the treaty. In fact all questions of
large importance had been adjusted wnen
the entry into power of a new Ministry
â¢ ell disposed toward the new treaty
made it necessary to begin the work ail

that a treaty will result. The issues do

LORD KITCHENER
ISSUES AN EDICT
Captured Boers Wearing
British Uniforms Are
to Die.
Peace Terms Which Kruger Is
Said to Be Willing to
Accept
LONDON, Nov. 12.â Dispatches to the
Daily Mail announce that the Cape Town
Guard has again been called out and that
Lord Kitchener has issued an order di
recting that all Boers captured in British
uniforms be shot.
The Daily Mail gives to-day another al
leged peace scheme which Kruger is said
to be willing to conclude. This would
be on the basis of granting autonomy to
the two republics under a convention
guaranteed by France and Russia in ex
change for concession to Great Britain
of the Rand district and the gold fields,
which should be regarded as the total
Boer indemnity.'
The story circulated in the United
States by a news agency to-day under
Amsterdam date, purporting to give the
peace terms which the Boers are willing
to accept and alleging that they are to
be embodied in a formal document for
circulation among the powers, was seem
ingly started in an English provincial pa
per and is denied by the Boer delegates
at The Hague.
THE HAGUE, Nov. 11.â The adminis
tration counsel of the iron tribunal will
meet November 20 to decide on the ap
peal of the Boers against the ruling that
the war in South Africa is not subject to
the court's consideration.
FIGHTS FOR POSSESSION
OF HIS LITTLE ONES
Samuel A. Rhoades, Accused of Kid
naping, Makes Counter Charges
Against Former Wife.
TACOMA, Nov. 11.â A spirited legal con
tesiforthe possession of Norman Rhoades,
aged 13, and Clara Rhoades, aged 11, was
commenced here in the Superior Court
to-day by their father, Samuel A.
Rhoades. The latter was arrested last
week in Lamar, Colo., for kidnaping the
boy and taking him out of the State
secretly. He returned to-day in custody
of Sheriff Hartman and is held under
$3500 bonds to await trial.
In a complaint which he filed to-day
Rhoades alleges that Mrs. Rhoades is un
fit to have charge of the children and re
quests the court to award them to him.
He is a veterinary surgeon with a fair
income and says he is both willing and
anxious to support and educate them.
The Rhoades were married in Denver
in May, 18&8. Later family disagreements
became common and they were divorced
in San Francisco. Rhoades alleges that
while the divorce suit was pending he was
notined by his attorneys that an arrange
ment had been entered into with Mrs.
Rhoades whereby she was to keep their
son and their daughter was to go to him.
Believing this was settled Rhoades paid
little attention to the case. He found
later that Mrs. Rhoades had sent both
children to Sitka, where they were when
the decree was entered. He understood
that under the decree he was to have
the privilege Â©f visiting the children as
often as he liked, but he says Mrs.
Rhcades has studiously prevented his see
ing them.
Upon these allegations Judge Chapman
has ordered Mrs. Rhoades and Sheriff
Hartman to show cause within five days
why both children should not be given to
their father.
POLITICAL OUTLOOK
PLEASING TO FLINT
Senator Satisfied With the Progress
of His Race for Gubernatorial
Nomination.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 11.â Senator
Thomas Flint Jr. of San Benito, candidate
for the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor, was in this city to-day looking over
the political field. He was met at the sta
tion by Judge F. W. Gregg and spent the
day in consultation with local politicians.
To The Call representative here Senator
Flint said:
"1 am in the race to stay. I have visited
many of the cities in Southern California
and I have been well received wherever I
went. My chances for winning the nomi
nation are improving every day.
"Governor Gage and I are friends, and I
do not expect the fight for nomination will
be anything more than a friendly politi
cal contest in which the strongest man
will win. I am simply making a prelimi
nary tour of Southern California and I
expect to visit this city again before
long."
Senator Flint went to Redlands this
afternoon and to-night he is in Los An
geles. To-morrow he will go to Santa
Ana. where there is a corner stone laying.
While here the Senator held a brief con
sultation with A. G. Kendall, candidate
for Railroad Commissioner, but no polit
ical arrangements were made. Who will
manage the fight in this county for Flint
is a question, and as far as can be learned
he has appointed no local lieutenants.

SECRETARY ROOT ORDERS CONVENED
BOARD OF OFFICERS OF HIGH RANK
Generals Miles, Brooke, Otis, Young, Mac Arthur, Bates, Randall and
Kobbe Will Make Important Recommendations Concerning
Military Posts and Distribution of the Arms of the Service
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. â The
Secretary of War has ordered
to be convened in Washing
ton, November 25. a very im
portant board of army offi
cers of high rank for the purpose of con
sidering several matters connected with
the army, particularly regarding the mili
tary posts and reservations. The board
consists of Lieutenant General Nelson A.
Miles. Major Generals John R. Brooke,
Elwell S. Otis, S. M. B. Young, Arthur
Mac Arthur, Brigadier Generals John C.
Bates, George M. Randall and William A.
Kobbe. The order directs the board to
consider the distribution of military posts
required for the proper accommodation,
Instruction and maintenance of the army.
The board shall make recommendations
as to what posts shall be abandoned or
retained, which should be enlarged and
to what extent, and the location and
character of new posts as may be neces
sary with a due regard to the proper dis
tribution of the different arms of the ser
vice, based upon strategic, sanitary and
economical considerations.
The board also will formulate and sub
mit a project for the location and sur
vey of sites for four permanent camp
grounds of instruction, the cost of the
sites and the expense of putting them in
condition for such camp grounds.
The findings of this board will be re
ported to Congress by the Secretary of
War. This order does not apply to sea
coast fortifications.
RAILROAD WINS
LEGAL SKIRMISH
United States Supreme
Court Makes an Im
portant Ruling.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â A decision
was rendered by the United States Su
preme Court to-day in the case of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway
Company versus the Board of Railroad
and Warehouse Commissioners of Mis
souri. The case came to the Supreme
Court on a writ of error from the Su
preme Court of the State of Missouri and
the decision of the lower court was re
versed. The opinion was handed down by
Justice Brewer. The principal issue was
on the issue of the removal of the case
to the Federal courts. The case involves
the legality of the charge made by the
railroad company for transporting pas
sengers and freight across its bridge over
the Missouri River at Booneville. Mo.
The State law fixes the rate for carrying
passengers in Missouri at 3 cents per
mile, and it seems that the railroad com
pany attached an extra charge of 25 cents
for their transportation across the bridge,
and that an extra charge was also made
for freight crossing the bridge. The prac
tice was attacked by the Railroad Com
missioners and suit brought in the courtÃ
to enjoin the railroad company. In the
Supreme Court of the State the law was
sustained. Application was made to re
move the case to the Federal courts on
the ground that the company is a cor
poration of Kansas. The motion to this
effect was overruled by the State Su
preme Court, and it is this opinion that
is now reversed. The case therefore goes
back for further proceedings.
Police Stop a Fight.
TRENTON, N. J., Nov. 11.-The bout to

the latter would have been beaten in a
minute or so if the contest had continued.

STEAMER STRIKES
SUNKEN ICEBERG
Panic Seizes Upon the
City of Topeka's
Passengers.
SEATTLE, Nov. 11.â The Lynn Canal
steamer City of Topeka, Captain Oleson,
steamed slowly into the harbor this
morning with her stem bent and a gaping
hole near the load-line. The steamer col
lided with a sunken Iceberg in Taku Bay
on the up trip on the night of November 2.
A blinding snowstorm was raging at the
time, and when the shock came some of
the passengers, believing the ship wag go
ing down, made frenzied attempts to get
into life-preservers. It was soon found
that, although several Iron plates broke
through, tiere was no immediate danger.
The steamer was taken to Douglas
Island after the accident for an investiga
tion, and it was decided that the Topeka
should be allowed to return to Seattle
without cargo or passengers. The extent
of the damage is estimated at about $5000
besides the loss of a trip and the necessary
expense and delay that must ensue while
the vessel is being repaired.
On account of the accident the Topeka
did not call at Skaguay, and therefore
brought no late news.
INDIGNATION MEETINGS
HELD THROUGHOUT GERMANY
Populace Greatly Aroused Over Eng
lish Criticism of the German
Troops.
BERLIN, Nov. 11.â Referring it to the
various meetings held throughout Ger
many to denounce the recent reflections
cast by Chamberlain in his speech at
Edinburgh upon the conduct of the Ger
man troops in the war with France, the
Cologne Yolks Zeitung excuses the dem
onstration by pointing out that no Ger
man Government organ has printed a
semi-official repudiation of Chamberlain's
sentiment, and that in the absence of
such a repudiation public opinion must
find expression in other ways. v
"The movement shows," says the paper,
"that the German people cannot under
stand how British insolence can be put
up with, and how anybody can demonstra
tively show anglomania."
This is regarded as a thrust at Emperor
William.

powder in a mining shaft yesterday, just
to see what would occur. He never
learned the result.
The boy had gone out to spend the day
hunting with a companion. They came
across a mining shaft, which they decided
to explore. The shaft was thirty feet deep
and at the bottom was a box filled with
giant powder, which had been placed there
by the owners of the mine preparatory to
doing the annual assessment work. A
large tub covered the box, to prevent an
explosion in case rocks fell from the side
of the shaft. The boys lifted the tub
from the box, and John McNally said he
would fire into the giant powder from the
ground above as soon as they climbed the
ladder to the surface.
Arriving at the surface, his companion
went to the end of the ore dump, while
John took aim. An instant later there was
a terrific explosion. Great rocks arose in
the air, and the earth shook violently for
several hundred yards. The body of John
McNally was blown a distance of forty
feet, and the head was completely sev
ered.
The survivor of the explosion ran to
town and spread the news of his com
panion's death. McNally was the son of
a prominent citizen of Bisbee. He wai
14 years of age.
FALLS FROM STTTDY WIBTDOW
AND IS INSTANTLY KILLED
Professor Bichard Mayo-Smith of Co
lumbia Tjniversity Meets With
a Fatal Accident.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Richard Mayo-
Smith, a professor of political economy at
Columbia University, was instantly killed
to-night by falling from a window of his
study on the fourth floor of his residence,
on West Seventy-seventh street, to the
stone nagging in the rear. So far as the
police have investigated the case, they
couclude that the fall was accidental. Pro
fessor Mayo-Smith had been ill for a few
months, but not alarmingly so. He was
47 years old, and had been a professor of
political economy at Columbia since 1883.
He had written much on economic sub
jects and was the author of several
books.

HELD PRISONER
AT PORTO RICO
Authorities Place Labor
Organizer Iglesias Un
der Arrest.
President Roosevelt Cables to
Learn Cause of His
Detention.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.-Samuel Gom
pers, president of the American Federa
tion of Labor, to-day saw the President
to protest against the arrest of Santiago
Iglesias, who was sent to Porto Rico by
the federation to organize the working
men of the island.
Before Iglesias left the United States
Gompers explained to the President the
purpose of his visit and asked that Gov
ernor Hunt be notined that his mission
was not to stir up strife, but simply to
organize labor along legitimate lines. At
that time he told the President that Igle
sias, during the Spanish ascendency, had
opposed the Spanish regime and had been
imprisoned, having been liberated when
the American troops reached San Juan.
By the President's direction Secretary
Cortelyou wrote to Governor Hunt con
cerning Iglesias' mission. That letter
was dated October 19. Last Saturday
Gompers was surprised to receive the fol
lowing cablegram from Iglesias:
"Was arrested when I stepped ashore.
No warrant was shown. Am ignorant of
charges. Remain in jail."
This message Gompers showed to the
President and the President immediately
sent an inquiry to Governor Hunt as to
the cause of the arrest.
During Gompers' interview to-day he
spokg to the President about labor organ -
ization, the extension of the eight-hour
law and the alien contract labor law.
Gompers was especially anxious that the
President should recommend the re-enact
ment of the Chinese exclusion act, and he
came away impressed with the belief that
the President would do so.
WED DESPITE OBJECTION
OF YOXTNG LADY'S PARENrS
Returned Philippine Soldier and His
Betrothed Scoff at Paternal
Wrath.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 11.â A pretty love ro
mance, in which "Tom" Murphy, a re
turned Philippine soldier, and Miss Annie
Thole are the principals, has just come
to light. For five years Papa Thole's re
fusal to consent to a marriage delayed
the ceremony. On August 27, however,
the young couple went to Oakland and
wedded. This they kept secret until a
few days ago, when they decided to ask
foi the forgiveness of their parents. The
young lady's parents were obdurate, and
even ordered Mr. and Mrs. Murphy away.
Murphy first met his sweetheart while
employed in a laundry belonging to the
girl's parents. After a lew weeks they
became engaged, but her father objected
to Murphy because of his wildness. Miss
Thole refused to give him up, and prom
ised Murphy that if he would quit drink
ing she would marry him.
The Spanish war broke out about this
time and Murphy enlisted in one of the
State regiments and later went to the
Philippines with the Thirty-fifth United
States Volunteers. He abstained from
drink and each month sent his betrothed
the major portion of his $15 60. By strict
attention to duty Murphy arose to a non
commissioned officer's post.
When Murphy was mustered out last
year he and Miss Thole again went be
fore her parents to ask their consent, but
paterfamilias still refused. Finally they
decided to wait no longer and the trip to
Oakland followed.
TWO TRAINS IN OREGON
COLLIDE ON A SIDING
Freight Cars and Passenger Coaches
Badly Wrecked, but No Lives
Are Lost.
LAGRANDE, Or., Nov. 11.â The west
bound passenger train on the O. R. and
N. this morning ran into freight train
No. 21, which was standing on the track
near here- A light engine standing about
four car lengths behind broke the force
of the contact and prevented the wreck
from being more serious, but the caboose
and one stock car were converted into
kindling wood.
The engineer on the light engine, ex
pecting the passenger train, had sent a
flagman back, and Engineer Stanfleet saw
the signal, not in time, however, to stop
the train on the frosty track. Many of
the passengers received minor injuries,
but no one was seriously hurt. The win
dows of the coaches were shaken out and
both engines were badly damaged.
Not Guilty of Wife Murder.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11.â The trial of

after nineteen minutes' deliberation.
Judge Smith, in his instructions to the
jury, asked for acquittal on the ground
that the evidence had not proved murder,
although the defendant had aroused sus
picions by his contradictory statements
and his unaccountable actions since his

RUNNING FIGHT
WITH CONVICT
Leader of Penitentiary
Mutiny Is Captured
by Deputies.
Fires at His Pursuers, Who
Bring Him Down With
a Bullet
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 11â Frank
Thompson, colored, the leader of the mu
tiny at the Federal penitentiary, which,
resulted in the escape of twenty-six pris
oners last Thursday, was captured eight
miles north of Council Grove this evening
by a posse under command of Deputy
United States Marshal Prescott. Thomp
son would not surrender, but was taken
after a hard fight with the officers, in
which he was shot in the head without
being severely injured. No member oÂ£
the posse was hurt.
Deputy Marshal Prescott has been in
Council Grove since Saturday morning, on
the lookout for escaped prisoners. Tnere
are a number of them in this vicinity,
and several depredations have resulted
from their presence. This morning Dep
uty Prescott heard of the reported pres
ence of a negro convict a fÂ»w miles north
of town and immediately set out to make
tne capture, assisted by Sheriff Mitchell
and otiÂ«er officers.
The officers had just emerged from a
wooded trail when they caugnt sight of
Ihompson running across the open. He
wad ordered to halt, but he answered oy
wheeling around and doing some rapid
tiring with his big 44-ealiber revolver. The
officers then tireu und Thompson dropped.
He was stunned and the officers easily
secured him.
Thompson will be taken to the peniten
tiary to-morrow. As he was the ring
leader of the mutiny he will be severely
dealt with. Warden McClaughrey an
nounced his intention several clays ago of
having all the fugitives indicted for con
spiracy. Thompson's sentence will un
doubtedly be hanging, while the others
will, have their terms lengthened.
Lawrence Lewis was mortally wounded
this morning near yuenemo, Kans., whiie
making a dash through a cordon of
armed deputies. Now there are but thir
teen prisoners at large.- Lewis is a white
boy, 20 years of age, who waa sent up in
October, 1900. to undergo a five-year sen
tence for larceny.
Three distinct gangs of convicts have
been reported at points fifteen miles
around Topeka since last night, and, al
though squads of penitentiary guards,
deputies anu farmers have been on the
go all day, night fell with only one cap
ture, that of Lewis.
From the descriptions received Warden
McClaughrey believes that the two cap
tors of Sheriff Cook of Topeka were
Arthur Hewitt, white, and Lon Souther
land, a part Indian. Hewitt, with Frank
Thompson, a negro, were ringleaders in
the outbreak and the Warden to-day in
creased the reward for their capture.
Hewitt and Southerland were both serv
ing five-year sentences for larceny. Hew
itt is 23 years old, while Southerland i 3
but 18.
At Alma. Kans.. a running fight last
night with two escaped convicts is re
ported. The convicts had stolen two
horses and made good their escape after
shooting a horse from under one of their
pursuers.
OBJECT TO THE INDIANS
DOING WORK ON ROADS
Citizens of Arizona Confront the In
terior Department With a New
Labor Problem.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â A labor prob
lem such as has arisen only rarely in the
Indian service confronts the Interior De
partment as a result of the action of fifty
Indians of the San Carlos (Arizona) res
ervation, who under the leadership of the
agency farmer went to work on rouua
near the reservation.
Official advices received by the Interior
Department to-day announce that citi
zens of that vicinity met last night and
finally remonstrated against the employ
ment of Indians on road work outside the
reservation. No details were given. N
is said here that the construction work
on which the Indians have been engag;il
is not being done by the Government. It
is supposed that the basis of the objec
tion is competition by persons supported
by the Government. The San Carlos In
dians have the reputation of being indus
trious and hard working. A full report
has been telegraphed for.

REFEREE BEGINS TRAINING FOR BIG FIGHT
BALDWIN HORSES PERFORM MIRACLES
IN MUDDY GOING AT OAKLAND TRACK
HORSES from the Baldwin stable
trained by W. J. Spiers fairly
set the" track ablaze at Oakland
- yesterday. To begin with, in
the opening sketch, a sprint
over the ; Futurity course, Silva Cruz
romped 'in before a riffraff bunch
of two-year-olds at odds of 10 and
12 to 1. Three races later on
Green Morris started Sombrero, consid
ered unbeatable by the visitors from way
down East and a 1 to 3 chance in the
ring. Escalamo. from Funny Santa Anita.
showed him a cl^an pair of heels from
the start, winning eased up. In the clos
ing chapter Reina de Cuba, an 8 to 1 shot,
laid low the even money favorite Sen
Lion. The track was muddy and slow,
and besides the- Baldwin victories the oth
er surprise furnished was the downfall of
the Morris crack Watercure. Although
known to possess no fondness for moist
footing, it was supposed the chestnut
horse's class would pull him through, but
he was beaten p. length by the II to 1 shot
Rio Shannon, with J. Woods up.
Only One Successful Favorite.
For those who imagine winners ar.'
easier to pick in muddy going their de
tires must have beer, surfeited, as Hor
ton, a 7 to 10 choice, proved the only suc
cessful favorite.. Nearly. all of the book
makers put in a profitable inning, as
Scorpia was about the only one to give
the eheets a dreary look.
As it v.as conceded that a garden hose
played on the track would cause Water
cure to break it up, the price about the
Morris horse went from 4 to - 5 to 8 to 5.
The smart ones unloaded on Oscar Tolle.
and Ransom, who rode the Baldwin eir
try, scrambled the eggs beautifully for
them. At the start Johnny Woods on Rio
Shannon went away in the lead, with the
others trailing. Well into the stretch
O'Connor on Watercure challenged, but
the leader under hard urging held him
safe, winning by a length. Hansom made
no determined move with Oscar Tolle, fin
ishing a poor third.
J. \\\ Schorr's Commissioner Forster
ruled favorite lor the nrst event, but a
bumping match on the backstretch
knocked him out of the game. Silva Cruz
led irom the lump, beating Sir Lewis
without effort.
Apparently the brown colt Articulate
cannot strike his clip. He was dished up
a 6 to 5 favorite for the third race, over
six furlongs, and Scorpia downed him in
a gallop. The latter had Jesse Matthews
on his back and was played down from
6 to 4. Royal .-"lush was an "also ran."
Eecalante Outfoots Sombrero.
Nearly all of the paddock crowd laid
their checks down on Sombrero, the
Green Morris entry, in the six lurlong
sprint for two-year-olds. He did not lacK
speed by any meansâ was simply out
looted by Kscalante. Possibly wnen tbs
pair clash Â£.sain he may turn the tables,
but that is no certainty. Magi ran into
the show. ....
Greenock was scratched, leaving the
mile selling number a Cakewalk for Hor
ton. "Daggie" Smith's little chestnut
seemed to possess more early speed than
usual, and aided by the slow pace .set ran
away from his field in the sail home. See
on ar:on Lynch had the place won, but
eased up and was led out for that position
by oror.
Winnie O'Connor on Bookmaker Caesar
Young's horse. Sea ''"n. was unfortunate
in getting away poorly in the closing
event. Making a game effort from be
hind, the favorite was unable to close the
gap opened by Reina de Cuba, finishing
second in front of Censor.
Track Notes.
Tim Murphy, the well known plunger
and bookmaker, arrived from Chicago
last atog.
As. Lavator is owned by "Boots" Dur-
IMti. the horse will not be allowed to
start at Oakland to-day. Durnell was but
recently ruled off the turt by the French
lacinfi officials.
It begins to look as if "Lucky" Bald
Win would find ii cheaper in Me end to
pay the money "Jim" Oarland claims is
due him rrom the owner of Santa Anita
ranch. Jim boosted Silva Cruz $200 over
his entered selling price, and further
down the line bid up Keina de Cuba 1100.
Both horses were retained by the stable.
Starter Holtman gave Burlingame a
week on the ground for breaking the bar
rier with Sir .Lewis in the opening event.
Jimmy Coffey thought- so well of ; the
chances? of Rio Shannon that he let the
bay horse run loose. His previous per
lormances certainly did not warrant
much consideration. â¢
All of the Baldwin stable winners were
the get of famous Emperor of Norfolk,
and the splendid performances of Cru
zados and Escalante have caused the old
Fire's stock to boom. Each of the three
winners was piloted by Ransom, who
seems suddenly to have got a move on,
for he is a veritable wonder at getting
away from the barrier.
The yearlings from Antrim stock farm
will be sold at the Occidental Horse Ex
change to-night.
Small errors sometimes prove costly.

BECKHAM MAKES
STINGING REPLY
Severely Arraigns Chief
Magistrate of the
Hoosier State.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 11.â Governor
Eeckham to-night addressed to Governor
Durbin of Indiana a letter replying to the
criticism by that executive of the courts
and officials of Kentucky In his recent
letter refusing to honor the requisition for
Taylor and Flnley, wanted for alleged
complicity in the assassination of Gov
ernor Goebel. He severely arraigns Gov
ernor Durbin for his refusal, charging
that in doing so he violated his oath of
office to support the constitution of the
United States, and that he became a party
after the fact to the most infamous crime
in the history of this State, the cold
blooded and dastardly murder of an emi
nent and distinguished citizen of Ken
tucky.
The Kentucky executive also charges
that Governor Durbin's action in refusing
was the result of the political bargain
made before his election to office, and
characterizes his charges against the
courts and officials of Kentucky as serious
and inexcusable misrepresentations. He
takes the stand that the Governor of a
State has no discretionary powers, but
only ministerial powers. In the honoring
of legally drawn requieitions from other
States, and this is taken here as an in
dication that steps will shortly be taken
in the courts to compel Governor Durbin
by mandamus to honor the requisitions. If
such proceedings are instituted they will
be in the courts of Indiana, and taken on
appeal to the Supreme Court.

Healey's Hound Backed
for Stake Honors at
Petaluma.
Open Plains Coursing Meet
ing Is Attracting Large
Crowds.
Sueclal Dispatch to The Call.
PETALI'MA, Nov. 11.â The afternoon
trains brought crowds of coursing enthu
siasts and, judging from the lively inter
est taken in the overnight pools, this
year's open plains meeting is already a
success. The people of this city are par
tisans of Sisquoc, Denny Healey's fast
greyhound, and ar^ figuring him a cer
tainty for the final flag. 'Ihey claim Sis
quoc is on home grounds and, besides, is
trained to the hour. The invaders, too,
have a strcftig leaning toward Healey's
champion and are playing him for stake
honors. One thing Is certain: If Sisquoe
does not beat everything he meets, there
will be general disappointment.
Charley Grlswold reports that the re
cent rains have laid the dust on the field
and left the ground in the best of condi
tion. Jn the matter of second choice, tho
talent figures that the winner of the Van
dal-A. J. Martin course stands a great
chance to reach the final. Vandal had a
hard course at Union Park on Sunday
last, and many figure that he cannot come
back against the Junior Champion.
1-yneh's youngster sold favorite in the
opening pool at 3 to E over his opponent.
Sacramento Boy will not be overlooked.
Ills backers claim that he has completely
recovered from his injuries and that he
will surprise the best of them. His posi
tion on the card Is a good one and he will
likely figure close to the big money. In
dications point to a large attendance at
the opening round to-morrow morning.

HARRY CORBETT PROPOSES TO BE IN
CONDITION TO HANDLE THE FIGHTERS
HARRY CORBETT, WHO IS TO REFEREE THE JEFFRIES-RI'HT.IN CONTEST. DOES NOT INTEND TO TAKE
ANY CHANCES IN THE RING. HE HAS TAKEN THK VETERAN GEOKGK SILERS ADVICE AND IS DO
ING HIS STUNT DAILY.
HARRY CORBETT, who was se
se!(H-tP(I to referee the heavy
weight championship contest on
Friday evening, has gone Into
training. Every day Corbett
has taken a spin on the road to remove
superfluous flesh and Is strengthening his
arms in preparation of forcing Jeffries
and Ruhlin apart when they clinch. Cor
bett is reported to be in good condition
and ready to enter the ring at a minute's
notice.
Mr. Corbett has thought out a plan of
action that he will adhere to during: the
fight. He expects to render a decision
that will satisfy every spectator. He is
in hopes, however, that the contest will
not go the distance. Mr. Corbett said:
I have a thorough knowledge oÂ£ the Marquis
of Queensberry rules. 1 have read the articles
of agreement under which the men will contest
and I am sure there will be no delay or dis
pute when the men are In the rinsf. There
lore when I tell them to break I want them to
do bo without delay. I hope It will be un
necessary for me to step between the contest
ants to torce them apart. They are experienced
boxers and have a knowledge of the rules gov
erning the game of flsttcufrs. When a man is
knocked down 1 will Insist upon tne other re
tiring to hla corner or a sufficient distance, ao
that the man knocked down may rise it It be
in his power. I will be particularly on the
alert lor fouling, but I will not disqualify a
man for fouling unless he has deliberately at
tempted to do Â»o. In boxing there are unin
tentional fouls that are committed and I be
lieve It to be in the province of a referee to
overlook them. They are trivial and do neither |
man any harm. Both men are known to be
fair fighters and 1 look for no trouble from
them.
Queensberry Rules.
The Marquis of Queensberry rules, un
der which the men will battle, are as fol
lows:
1. To be a fair stand-uo boxins; match In a
twenty-tour foot ring, or as near that size
as practicable.
2. No wrestling or hugging allowed.
3 The rounds to be or three minutes' dura
tion, and one minute time between rounds.
4. If either man fall, through weakness or
otherwise, he must get up unassisted, ten sec
onds to be allowed him to do so, the other man
meanwhile to return to his corner, and whtn
the fallen man is on his legs the round is to be
resumed and continued until the three minutes
have expired. If one man fails to come to the
scratch in the ten seconds allowed it shall be
In the power of the referee to give his award
in iavor of the other man.
6. A man hanging on the ropes In a helpless
state, with his toes off the ground, shall be con
sidered down.
6. No seconds or any other rerson to be
allowed in the ring during the rounds.
7. Should the contest be stopped by any un
avoidable interference the referee to name time
and place, as soon aB possible, for finishing
the contest; so that the match must be won and
lost, unless the backers of both men agree to
draw the stakes.
8. The gloves to be fair sized boxing gloves
of the best quality and new.
9. Should a glove burst or come off It must
be replaced to the referee's satisfaction.
10. A man on one knee is considered down,
and if struck Is entitled to the stakes.
1. No shoes or boots with springs allowed.
12. The contest in all other respects to be
governed by revised London rules.
EileT Gives His Views.
George Slier, the famous referpe. gave
his views on refereelng ring contests. He
said:
Years ago I read the Marquis of Queensberry
rules vtiy carefully and came to the conclusion
that a referpe did not enter the ring to fight.
He is fiimply there to see that there is fair
play and give a decision if necessary. I do
not think the referee will have any trouble
Friday nlftht. Both men have fought repeat
edly and will undoubtedly abide by the rul
ings and instructions of the referee.
The referee In the ring should be cool and
collected. He should pay no attention to the
howis of the mob or the roars and cheers for
one man or the other. He should keep as
close to the contestants as he possibly can.
60 that If there is a knockdown tip will be
ready to count an quickly as possible and to
see that the other man retires far enough
away to allow the knocked down man to get
up. The question oX sending a man to his cor
ner, which of course the rules call for. is
wrong: in a senre. When the rules were
framed It was meant by the framer to send
the man to his corner, but what was to pre
vent a man standing over his opponent if the
latter was knocked down in hie corner? I am
of the opinion that when a man is knocked
down the other man should retire a sufficient
distance.
The referee, if possible, should bÂ« in a posi
tion to see in between the men. He need not
break them apart, but at times this cannot be
avoided. Fighters of experience have always
obeyed me when T quietly warned them to
bre.ik. The best way for a referee to gauge
himself on clinches is to step forward with
the man who is golna; to lead. If there is to
be hitting In the clinches the referee should
not attempt to go between the men when they
are locked, for he might be struck or give one
of the men an unexpected advantage.
Peter Maher is coming to this city to
challenge the winner of the championship f
contest. He sent word to Manager Ken- '
nedy of the Twentieth Century Club that
he would be. at the ringside. Maher a
few nights ago knocked out Jefford.s. the
California heavy-weight. In the event
that Sharkey does not come to this city I
and Fitzslmmons declines to meet the
winner of the fight, the Irish champion I
will be pitted against the victor in De
cember.
Preliminary Events.
"Spider" Welch and Joe Fields have
been matched to go eight rounds on the
night of the contest. They will battle for
the bantam championship of the coa.st.
Fields for two years was champion ama
teur bantam of the coast. Welch has a
reputation of being clever and a' stiff
puncher. Mike Curtin. a cousin of "Spl- j
dtr" Kelly, will box eight rounds with i
Billy Condon the same evening. The men j
will weigh in at 140 pounds.
During the championship battle the Pa- I
v:!ion will be in semi-darkness. This will
be necessary for the success of the mov
ing pictures. All the lights will be cen
tered on the ring and the spectators will
be able to watch every move of the con
testants.
The doors will be opened at 7 o'clock
en the evening of the battle. People hold
ing tickets for the gallery must present
them at the entrance on the Grove-street
side of the Pavilion. Only holders of re
served tickets will be allowed to enter at
the main entrance on the Larkin-street
side. There is every prospect of a crowd
ed house. The advance sale insures a
large attendance. The carpenters are bus- |
ily engaged at the Pavilion putting up \
boxes and the ring. It is the intention of j
the management to have Ruftlin and Jef
tries in the ring at 9:15 o'clock.
I think Jeffries is better than he ever was
before in his life. He is faster and cleverer.
I think he has improved 50 per cent since he
last fought In San i-'ranclsco. In his training !
the eha melon shows much good nature and
life. Nothing seems to bother him. and to my
mind this Is the best indication In the world
that he Is In good condition. It Is hard to j
say how long the fight will last. It will de- |
pend wholly upon the way Ruhlin will fight.
I fhink if Ruhlin fights as I have usually seen
him fijht. It will go over fifteen rounds. ;5o
far as the referee !Â¦ concerned he will have
no trouble at all. He could sit outside the
ring. There will be no fouls, as they are the
fairest fighters in the world.
At Jeffries' Quarters.
Jeffries worked fast in the gymnasium
of the Reliance Club yesterday morning, j
The big boiler-maker punched the bag |
and boxed eight fast rounds with Arm
strong and his brother. He then skipped
the rope, toyed with the rowing machine
and did other stunts. In the afternoon !
he performed before the moving picture
machine. Jeffries was too accommodat
ing. He had just finished a hearty lunch
and in order to please the manipulator of
the machine the champion did a great
amount of work on a full stomach.
Everybody thought Jim made a great
mistake In doing this.
Tom Jeffries, a brother of the cham- j
pion. was a visitor at training quarters. |
He is 30 years of age. but has never seen
San Francisco, having remained In Los
Angeles all his life. Jim will initiate his
brother in a few days.
George Slier watched Jeff go through
his performance and in an interview said:
I never saw Jeffries look better. He is much
faster on his feet. From the work I have swn
him do. Jeff has changed hi* aositlon. He
used to spread In taking his attitude. He now
keeps his feet closer tos p ther and as a result
he snrlrgs quickly and carries all his weight
with hla blows. The battle ought not so to
a finish.
Coach for Basket-Bali Team.
SANTA ROSA. Nov. 11.â The basket
ball players of the Santa Rosa High
School will have a coach from Berkeley
University to help them win the games
they are to play in the near future Miaa
Alma Stockwell has been engaged to

of California last year and she undoubt
edly will be of great service to the local
Players. The first game of this year in
which the Santa Rosa girls will figure

a US RUHL.IX underwent a thor- '
oufrh physical examinatfon at the^-
Six Mile House yesterday after
noon at the hands of Dr. C. A.
Clinton. . The physician pro
nounced Ruhlin a magnificent type of the
trained athlete and thoroughly sound
from the crown of his head to the soles
of his feet. The examination 'was made
Immediately after the Akron boxer had
been rubbed . down after his afternoon Â¦
gymnasium work. Dr. Clinton tapped and
sounded Ruhlin's chest, listened to the
well-gaited beats of his heart, and could
not find a serious flaw in the big fellow's
make-up. Ruhlin 'a heart was somewhat
enlarged, like those of all athletes who
indulge in violent exercise, but Dr. Clin
ton said that Jeffs blood-pumping organ
was in the same condition, ana that this
cardiac hypertrophy, as the condition 13
technically termed by medical" men. would
not retard the physical prowess or endur

WIRELESS SEA
SERVICE OPENS
Operator Is Now Send

Experiments Daily Made to
Insure Certainty of
Success.
The use of wireless telegraphy for the
purpose of connecting the Farallones and
the mainland of California has actually
begun. There has been no blare of trum
pets about the matter. The Department oi
Agriculture has sent a skilled man to this
State, who has had practice in the East
with wireless telegraphy, and he is now at
Point Reyes, where he is observing the
peculiarities of the climate and daily com
municating with the Weather Bureau In
this city. The original plan was to have
the Farallones connected directly with
Point Lobos. For some reason this has
been modiried, and the beginning of the
service will be between the Farallones and
Point Reyes. From the latter point in
formation received from North Farallon
Island will be sent to this city by wire.
The observatory building of the Weather
Bureau at Point Reyes is nearly com
pleted. The roof is not on, but will be
soon. When the station is ready to be
used the wireless telegraphy will begin.
The prospect is that it will be used during
part of the present rainy season, and it
may be able to signally demonstrate Its
"merits in the next few months. There is
little doubt that the original plan of hav
ing wireless communication between the
North Farallones and Point Lobos will be
adopted after a time.

Will Soon Be a Hulk.
The schooner Sparrow has been pur
chased by the Piper-Aden-Goodall Com
pany and is now being transformed into
a coal hulk. The firm's business has
grown so of late that more facilities for
handling coal have become necessary, and
the Sparrow was purchased to make a
companion to the Carbon. The Sparrow
is an old-timer, having been built on Oak
land Creek in 1869. Sne is now being dis
mantled at Mission-street wharf, and in
a few weeks will be a first-class hulk.
Water-Front Notes.
The steamer Mandalay while south
bound from Ooquille River almost ran
down a deer swimming in the open sea.
The vessel was stopped and after some
maneuvering the animal was got aboard
The captain thinks the animal was
driven to the water by hunters and swam

ELISE SONNENBERG
COMMITS SUICIDE
Melancholia Caused by Grieving Over
Her Mother's Death Drives Her
Into Insanity.
Miss Elise Sonnenberg. daughter of
Samuel Sonnenberg of 1502 California
street, committed suicide early yesterday
morning in the family residence by Inhal
ing illuminating gas.
Miss Sonnenberg was accustomed to
sleep with her niece, Miss Marion. That
young lady retired alone last Sunday
night, and when she awoke early yester
day morning she was surprised to find
her aunt missing. She went on a search
for her and found her lying dead on the
floor of the main drawing room with one
end of a gas tube in her mouth, the other
end of the tube being connected with the
chandelier.
Miss Sonnenberg was about 33 years old
and ever since the death of he"r mother
had been afflicted with melancholia. It
was not suspected by any member of the
family that she was insane, and they be
lieve that the rash deed was committed
in a moment of temporary insanity.

INDIAN FARMERS.
GOVERNOR MURPHY of Arizona has
recommended that the reservation Indians of
that Territory be taught farming and in
duced to contribute to their own support by that
means instead of subsisting in idleness on Govern
ment rations. This is a very practical and proper
suggestion. The policy pursued toward the reserva
tion Indians by the Government has been very un
wise. They have been permitted to have their dogs
and their ponies, the links that connect them with
barbarism, while they have not? been taught any occu
pation by which they could go forward toward civiliza
tion. If they had been taught how to keep sheep and
cattle, their introduction to agriculture and the arts
would have been natural.
As long as they have their ponies, when the Gov
ernment ration is not rich enough for their blood
they mount and go raiding. It is natural as long as
they know no other way. If shown how to supply
food by raising crops, feeding stock and shearing
sheep, there is no reason for supposing that they will
not adopt it. Their ponies should be replaced by plow
teams composed of slow mules and big-footed horses,
useful on the farm but useless on the warpath. Noth
ing will go more to tame and make them self-sup
porting. If Governor Murphy's policy is carried out
the graduates of the various Indian schools who have
learned the arts will have use for their knowledge
when they return to their people. At present there
is nothing for these graduates to do except get into
a blanket and gee string, walk pigeon toed, look
through their eyebrows and feed at the Government
table. The money spent in training them is thrown
away. But if their wild brothers are taught to use
the pruning hook and plow they will return to the
reservations to apply their knowledge, use their edu
cation and assist in civilizing their red brethren.
The Indian problem is to be with us for many a
year to come, and it is time that we studied its solu
tion in the light of humanity and progress. In his
natural state the Indian lived by the chase, with a
little gambling and robbery on the side. We cut off
his hunting, give him but little to bet on games, and
leave him to raiding and robbery as the sole sur
vivors of his natural condition, and kill him when he
does either. The Navajos. Moquis and some other
old tribes in New Mexico and Arizona understand
some of Jhe arts. They keep floews and herds, weave
fabrics, make pottery and work in metals. They are
usually peaceable Indians and a very interesting peo
ple. Their further advancement is easy if their an
cient mysteries and rituals are left undisturbed. They
have done for themselves what the Government ought
to help the wilder tribes to do. If white men skilled
in knowledge of the Indian character were enlisted
in the work and apt Indians- were encouraged by
preferment, within two generations the tribes now
wild, caged, sullen and helpless might be transformed
into self-supporting and measurably civilized people.
It comes too late to do any good on this side of
the continent, but nevertheless it is worth noting that
Colonel Bryan in the issue of the Commoner just
before the election advised his readers not to bet on
the result. It will be seen that the prophet has quit
predicting.
According to reports from London, Lord Roberts,
not content with retiring from command in South
Africa, would like to retire from the army altogether
, and take a rest; and it may be safely said there are a
good many other British officers who have the same
tired feeling.
Chauncey Depew is reported to have said that New
York is the city by which foreigners judge America,
and if it be so we car. understand why our foreign
critics never show any evidence of knowing any
thing about America.
THE PRESIDENT ON TRUSTS.
WHILE much of the detail given may be
erroneous, there is no reason for believing
that President Roosevelt has changed his
position on the trust issue. As Governor of New
York he did all that a Governor may do to enforce
that publicity in trust affairs which should be re
quired of all corporations that have stocks listed for
investment by the public. During his candidacy for
the Vice Presidency last year he called attention to
this record and reaffirmed his position.
The antitrust press and politicians, and by anti
trust we mean those that have used the issue solely
for party advantage, have so widely advertised an
overdrawn estimate of the power and profits of trusts
as to make it easy for reckless promoters to victimize
the investing public. The enormous aggregate of
capitalizations last year, stupendous as it was, hardly
satisfied the craving for trust stocks, and, as we then
said, was likely to lay the foundation for a stock
panic.
President Roosevelt is no amateur in business laws
and logic. He is not a rich man, nor a speculator,
and has been content to live largely upon the gener
ous income furnished by his pen. But he knows
thoroughly the ins and^mts of stock speculation and
the difference between the intrinsic and speculative
values of stocks. The law protects the people against
wildcat insurance, and should equally guard them
against commercial paper that is without value to
justify its price.
As long as promoters can sell stocks that represent
value only to a small percentage of their par, so long
the inflation of paper property will continue. Upon
this inflation is built a structure of credit ready to
tumble at the first sign of a panic.
The limitation of this possibility by the President's
plan for a law that will guarantee the public against
fraud and inform investors who buy industrial stocks
will be a curb bit in the mouth of speculation. Con
currently with this policy, it is understood that the
President favors any legislation that will protect also
the industrial organization of labor. This is of as
much importance as the trust legislation. When cor
porations, responsible under their charter, and indi
vidual employers responsible in their property, be
come parties to an industrial contention with labor
organized under no special statute, State or Federal,
labor is at a disadvantage by reason of the uncertainty
as to its legal responsibility. Let it have the same
position and advantage as a corporation, and a great
change will come over the situation. Then instead
of violence there will be negotiation, and instead of
restraint of trade by destructive strikes there will be
orderly settlement on the lines of law and mutual
responsibility.
As far as it is disclosed in his record and expres
sions the policy of President Roosevelt in these two
particulars is just now of major importance to the
country. A righteous law rigidly enforced that will
leave the energy- of combined capital unimpaired, and
at the same time improve the morals of that artificial
person, the corporation, which represents the com
bination, will mean the acceleration rather than the
check of industrial development and progress, and
the putting of labor organizations on a legal equality
with organizations of capital will combine the in
terests of the two so that their differences will be
adjustable by agreement or by judicial intervention,
and our industrial progress will be free of hindrance
by strikes.
It is to be expected that the minority m Congress
will oppose these Presidential recommendations. The
leaders of that minority do not desire the correction
of any evils that may appear in the trust organiza
tions, nor do they desire anything that will give to
labor legal responsibility commensurate with its
necessities. Whatever evil is a,broad in this issue
serves as capital for the minority, and therefore it op
poses any wise legislation that will abridge its politi
cal capital. If the trusts are curbed properly and
their industrial energy left unimpaired, our conquest
of the world's commerce will be unchecked and our
domestic prosperity will continue. None of these
results are agreeable to the partisanship and the
political ambition of the minority leaders, so we may
expect that the President's position will be attacked
and his policy denounced for its insufficiency by the
minority which was confessed by its recent candi
date for Governor of Massachusetts to be without
hope while the country is prosperous.
Once more the British are to make a long pull, a
strong pull and a pull all together in South Africa.
Their object now is to close up the struggle promptly
so that the royal heralds may proclaim peace through
out the empire at the time of the coronation of King
Edward.
A PROBLEM IN CRIME.
CRIME is incessantly presenting new problems
to the student of human nature*. About as
soon as moralists agree upon a theory to ac
count for the criminal impulse, there breaks forth
upon the world a new series of crimes which cannot
be accounted for by that theory. Recently the teach
ings of Lombroso and Nordau have about persuaded
the world that crime is the result of degeneration and
that the criminal type is marked by certain physical
characteristics which distinguish it from the normal
type. The theory is plausible, but it does not fit the
facts.
At the present time the police authorities in Massa
chusetts and in Illinois are engaged in dealing with
kindred crimes which cannot be explained on the
ground of degeneration, and yet are in their nature
seemingly so willful and unprovoked as to be ap
palling.
The Massachusetts case is that of a professional
nurse, a young woman of good breeding and training
and of excellent habits so far as is known, but who is
suspected of having poisoned no less than eleven
patients whom she was called in to nurse. In the
Illinois case two professional nurses at a State asylum
for the insane are charged with the murder of two
women patients in the asylum whom they were em
ployed to look after. In the Illinois case it is stated
the nurses did not mean to kill the patients, but
merely wished to make them so weak that they
would be removed from that ward to another, and
thus the nurses would be relieved of the care of them.
In the Massachusetts case no reasonable theory has
been advanced to account for the killing of any one
of the eleven persons whom the nurse is suspected
of killing, and not until further evidence is forth
coming can it be safe to make even a guess.
Here, then, are three young women sufficiently nor
mal in body and mind to become accredited profes
sional nurses and to find employment in State institu
tions and in families of well-to-do patients attended
by reputable physicians. Yet these women, for what
seems to be no more than a mere caprice, put the pa
tient to death. It seems that when they get tired of
nursing a particular patient they do not put them
selves to the trouble of resigning the work or sub
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1901.
ject themselves to the discredit of abandoning the
case, but they quietly kill the patient and then get a
new one.
It will be remembered that many persons sup
posed that Czolgosz was a degenerate, that he was
physically and mentally abnormal; but the theory
was refuted by the investigations of the three special
ists who made a careful study of him. In their re
port they say: "He is not a case o,f paranoia, because
he has no systematized delusions reverting to self,
and because he is in exceptionally good condition and
has an unbroken record of good health. His capacity
for labor has always been good and equal to that of
his fellows. These facts all tend to prove that the man
has an unimpaired mind. * * * He is not to be
classed as a degenerate, because we do not find the
stigmata of degeneration; his skull is symmetrical; his
ears do not protrude, nor are they of abnormal size,
and his palate is not highly arched. Psychically he
has not a history of cruelty or of perverted tastes
and habits. He is the. product of anarchy, sane and
responsible."
The crime of Czolgosz, then, is to be attributed
directly and exclusively to anarchy, but what of the
crimes of the three professional nurses? It is a
new conundrum for the criminologist.
While some of our cities are troubled by a pe"st of
sparrows, it is reported that Vienna is so overrun by
pigeons the municipal government has offered re
wards for their capture and the destruction of their
eggs. The captured birds are to be killed and dis
tributed among the .poor, so for a while, at least,
pigeon pie in Vienna will be cheaper than beans.
HCLAY EVANS, Commissioner of Pensions,
in his report for the fiscal year ending June
â¢ 30, 1901, .makes an exhaustive statement of
the defects of the pension laws and of the oppor
tunities they offer for the commission of fraud by
unscrupulous persons. In the report many specific
instances of fraud are cited as typical of the various
methods used by sharpers in taking advantage of the
liberality of the Government in providing for the
soldiers of the republic and their families.
The number of pensioners on the rolls at the close
of the fiscal year under review was 997,735, being over
4000 in excess of any previous year. This includes
for the war of the revolution 9 pensioners; for the
war of 1812, 1528; Indian wars, 4565; Mexican war,
15.677; civil war invalids, 735,789; civil war widows,
234,563; Spanish war invalids, 3555; Spanish war
widows, 2049. The total appropriations for the Pen
sion Bureau for the year were $144,000,000. Of that
sum there was paid out in pensions $138,531,483, the
remainder being employed in the maintenance and
operation of the Bureau.
As an illustration of the activity of some pension
attorneys in hunting up pension cases and urging
any one who has a shadow of a claim to apply for a
pension, the Commissioner points out that notwith
standing the brevity of our war with Spain, "the num
ber of claims filed for pensions as a result of disa
bilities incurred in the service in line of duty from
April 21, 1898, to June 30, 1901, was 45,710, and since
that date many claims have been filed as the result
of the muster out of troops at San Francisco during
the month of June, 1901." The Commissioner adds:
"Only a little over three years have passed since hos
tilities began, and yet claims amounting in number
to about 20 per cent of the number of men enlisted
for the Spanish war have already been filed."
Commenting upon these claims the Commissioner
says: "I am not prepared to believe that those en
gaged in the war with Spain, many of them sons of
veterans of the civil war, were less patriotic than their
ancestors, or that they are more covetous; but in my
opinion it is the fault of the system of pensioning,
with its active army of attorneys, solicitors and drum
mers, practically employed and licensed by the Gov
ernment to solicit and secure applications ior pen
sions, with the promise of $25 for each claim that is
secured and allowed. No blame or criticism should
be attached to the soldiers, as they are importuned
and persuaded that it is their duty to file claims
whether disabled or not."
There are now 19,992 attorneys entitled to prac
tice before the Pension Bureau, an increase of 776
since last year. The fees paid to attorneys during the
year out of first payments to pensioners amounted to
$529,245, being an increase of $73,868 over the pre
vious year. There are now pending 403,569 claims for
pensions.
After citing numerous cases of downright fraud
practiced to obtain pensions and frequently to rob
the pensioner, the Commissioner says: "No argu
ment is needed to show that the expenditure of such
vast sums of the people's money should rest upon a
system containing more of the' elements of protec
tion to the Government than can be found in the
methods now in force in settling pension claims. The
fault is not with the soldier claimant or his widow,
but the system devised for ascertaining their rights
is so faulty that it offers a most inviting field for the
enterprising and adventurous claim agent or attorney.
It holds out an inducement to those that may be
persuaded to file false claims or fraudulent evidence
in support of valid ones. In fact, the system aids and
encourages fraudulent practices of various sorts. It
is not to be wondered at that the Government is con
stantly being imposed upon. When attention is called
to the defects which are responsible for these con
ditions, a mighty howl goes up in certain quarters.
These conditions arc not new. They have existed
ever since the war, and able and conscientious Com
missioners, members of both of the great political
parties, have in their annual reports strongly pro
tested against them."
There is a movement in Chicago to organize an
art association of 500,000 persons, each of whom is
to contribute $2 a year, making annually a fund of
$1,000,000 to be employed in erecting statues, monu
ments and memorials and in purchasing pictures for
the public art galleries. The idea is a big one, but
it remains to be seen whether the movement can be
made strong enough to carry it.
It is announced that all the European nations are
highly gratified by the results of the French method
of dealing with the Sultan and forcing him to come
to time, so that when the French warships leave the
Levant we may expect the Sultan to wake up some
morning and perceive that there are others.
If Miss Stone should escape from the Bulgarian
bandits she could easily recoup the $100,000 paid for
her ransom by taking to the lecture stage with an
account of missionary life in the East or how it feels
to an old maid to be run away with.
It is said this is going to be one of the greatest
seasons on record for book publishing, but it is a
safe bet the greatness will lie in the quantity and not
the quality.
PENSIONS AND FRAUDS.
JUDGE NOYES VEHEMENTLY DENIES
ALL CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIM
McLaughlin Pilots Witness From Time McKenzie Was Ap
pointed Receiver Until His Arrest, but Questions Develop
Little but Opinion of Witness That He Is Not Guilty
JUDGE ARTHUR H. NOYES, SKETCHED FROM LIFE BY A CALL ARTIST AS HE WAS GIVING TESTIMONY
IN HIS OWN BEHALF YESTERDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON DURING THE CONTEMPT PROCEED
INGS NOW IN PROGRESS BEFORE COMMISSIONER IIEACOCK.
JUDGE NOYES grew hoarse yester
day from saying "That's not true"
or "It's false." He was on the wit
ness stand morning and afternoon
for direct examination, and In five
tfnd a half hours of testifying he uttered
enough general and specific denials to fill
two records.
Judge Mclaughlin turned the wheel of
questions. Judge Noyes stood the strain
in good fashion. His answers were ready,
brusque and positive. To save time the
amicus curiae Interposed no objections,
and all day long the steady current of
question and answer went on. McLaugh
lin followed out the chronological .se
quence of events at first and then took
up the individual evidence which goes to
show the contempt. He has not yet fin
ished.
Here Is a bit of Judge Noyes' testi
mony:
Nome was a mining camp shut in irom the
world from the first of November to the last
day of February. Marshal Vawter once said:
"Winter once in Alaska and everybody will
hate you." So it was, I know there was a
great deal of talk, but I chose to ignore it.
There was the kindliest feeling of every citizen
in Nome toward me until news came in from
the outside. I w;as asked to join the Arctic-
Brotherhood. I was entertained by the Knights
Templar. Soon after the arrival of the opin
ion in the McKenzle case and papers contain
ing adverse comments on my conduct public
disfavor srew.
The reported conversations between
Judge Noyes and Judge Johnson and
Judge Noyes and Marshal Vawter gave
the witness opportunities for strong de
nial. He said:
Borne parts of the conversation with Judge
Johnson are true. When the ouinion in the
McKenzie case arrived I was sore. I called
his attention to certain features of that opin
ion. I always regarded Johnson as my friend.
That statement which goes to the dictatorship
of the Circuit Court of Appeals was uttered,
but It was in the tone of one wounded and
hurt rather than in anger. I do remember say
ing that I was condemned without being heard.
I talked considerably.
As to Vawter, Judge Noyes character
ized him as a "parrot, who should be
taught reasonable stories." It was Vaw
ter who told about Noyes' and the "sand
lotter" charges against the Circuit Court.
McKenzie as Receiver.
The examination of Judge Noyes by
Attorney McLaughlin was continued at
9:30 o'clock. After a statement concern
ing the acquaintanceship with R. N. Ste
vens and J. K. Woods the receiverships
issued on July 23 came into play.
The witness said:
Mr. Hume came to the hotel on that day
with a bundle of papers. He said the matter
was very urgent. I told him that I was going
to St. Michael. He said it was an important
matter, so I went to my chambers, where he
read the complaint and affidavits in the cases
and told me that tfley had been put off for a
year, that the defendants were working night
and day to exhaust the claims and he asked
me to appoint a receiver. I suggested Alex
ander McKenzie and wÂ« then talked of bonds\
He thought $8000 in the five cases "would be
sufficient until my return from St. Michael.
After this I met Jim Matthews and McKenzie.
McKenzie was addressed in regard to the re
ceiverships and said he would be glad to ac
cept. Hume came back in course of half an
hour with the papers and I called the atten
tion of Dickey to them. All but two were
marked to be filed.
I never had any talk with Hume about the
orders and I did not so Into Woods' room.
Changing of Orders.
Â¦In regard to the changing of order?.
Judge Noyes said that he wanted matters
to proceed peacefully, and that Is why he
agreed to Metson's suggestion. He said:
The second order was made under a mistake.
I am not seeking to justify It. Mr. Metson came
to the office under excitement. I do not think
he mentioned that the personal property was
worth $160,000. or that he pleaded that I should'
not use drastic methods. Mr. M^tson la a
quick tempered man as well as a brave one.
I don't think I told him to go to McKenzie.
The witness then testified that he or
dered a re-argument on the matters sub
mitted on July 24. This lasted several
days and took place after Judge Noyes'
return from Michael. On August 10
an order was filed overruling the motion.
Then came the motions in all i the cases
for an appeal and an application for a
supersedeas bond. This motion was de
nied in all the cases. Subsequently a bill
of exceptions was prepared. The witness
said:
I requested Reed to see that the records
should he complete, and they were got out with
all directness, and If there was a delay it was
without my knowledge or suspicion.
This testimony is in contradiction to
Borchsenius' statement.
The affidavit of Hume, which was sworn
to before John T. Reid, was the subject of
the next line of questions. Noyes said
that he never advised- or directed Hume
to make any affidavit.
"Was it ever your understanding that
defendants had the right, in the even*
of McKenzie's refusal to turn over the
gold dust, to use force to take possession
of it?"
"I never did." â¢ . * ; .
. , Writs and Arrests.
"Did you think that if McKenzie should
take the gold away the- Marshal should
intercede?"
"I certainly did." . Â¦* -
"Or that if the defendants attempted
to break the bank?"
"Yes, sir." . \
"Did you Instruct Captain French not
to issue any executive order?"
"I don't remember any such instruc
tion." i y
The witness then told of Knight's visit
He said:
â¢He called upon me on the evening of Septem
ber 14 and requested me to sign an order di
recting McKenzie to turn over the gold dust
in accordance with the writs. I am sure It la a
mistake on Knight's part In regard to my hav
ing seen McKenzie on . September 14 I told
him I could issue no order further than what
was required by the Circuit Court of Anneals
that I was now without authority as the court
saw nt to act directly and not through me.
"Was . your attention directed to the
amendment allowing appeal in receiver
ship or in argument?"
"No. sir; I never â¢ knew it until some
time after. Â¦ -
The examination took a jump at this
stage to the date of the arrest of McKen*
zie .UÂ°? October 13. "Word was sent me."
said Judge Noyes. "that. I should stop at
Geary office on my way to the court
house. I stepped in. and a writ of habeas
corpus was submitted, but I refused to
issue it.
"Did you see McKenzie on that day?"
continued the examiner. â¢Â»
'Â¦ "Yes, before , refusing the writ." re -
sponded the w'tness.
"Have you any, recollection of bein* in
the office more than once on that day?"
"I may have stopped there also on my
way to or from lunch. I know that th^
papers were presented and that I refuse 1
to sign the writ."
"If you had "earned that McKenzie wnÂ»W
arrested, and although you had not be iF
requested to call upon him, would you'
have done so?"
"I most certainly would."
On ( tetofcer 10 Judge Noyes Issued an
order restraining MrKenzle from deposit
ing the gold, but allowed the operation
of the mine.
"Did you at any time advise McKenzia
or his attorneys Tiot to turn over the gold
dust?" asked McLaughlin.
"[ did not. I told McKenzie that I
should comply with the orders of the court
above. He asked me what he should do
about it. and I told him I had no advice to
I give him; that he should see his attor
neys."
General and Specific Denials.
Judge McLaughlin finished the chrono
logical interrogation at this point. He
thfn wont back to till in with contrad 1
tions of Hume's testimony. Noyes denied
till knowledge of McKenzie's connection
with Hume in Mgarii to the partnership
Interest in the firm of Hubbard. Be^man
& Hume. The reprimand of Hume in court
by the Judge was gon* over, and the lat
ter denied that McKenzie had ever spoken
to him about it. or that he had met Hume
after its occurrence and apologized.
Hume's testimony as to the change of at
torneys proving a change of opinion from
the Judge was taken up piecemeal and re
verse statements made in every particu
lar. â
"State your relations with Mr. Wheel
er, requested McLaughlin. And then the
irrepressible Archie Wheeler entered the
case again. Hand in hand Archie Wheeler,
stenographer, typewriter and Judge Noy
went from Minneapolis to Nome. WhejA
Frost came upon the scene he recojjl
mended the Department of Justice to ?rV
low Judge Noyes a private secretary with
a J2SOT. salary. This allowance was made,
and Wheeler continued as Noyes' priv 1
I secretary until he left on the Roanoke in
I October.
"Mr. Metson says one reason of his ani
mosity against me is that Wheeler wen:
out to make affidavits against him. "
clared the witness. "I know no reason for
it."
At 11 o'clock the attorneys of the case
went before the Circuit Court of Appeals.
On Wednesday a report must be made as
to the time when the examination will be
concluded.

American Companions.
Grand Chief Companion Miss Ticoulet
of the Companions of the Forest of Amer

visitations. In company of Miss Maggie
Forest, past chief companion of Inter Nos
Circle, she visited Watsonville, where she
and her companions became the guests of
Orand Right Guide Miss A. Rogge. Dur
ing her stay there the grand chief com
panion was shown many courtesies and
after her visit to the circle in that city
was tendered a fine banquet. During the
visit the circle, which did excellent work,
initiated nine candidates. She was then
driven to Salinas, where an official visit
was paid Santa Lucia Circle, where there
was the initiation of two candidates. The
work in that circle, ritualistic and floor,
surpassed anything ever given in a circle
of the order in this jurisdiction. Those
who took part in the floor work moved
as if they were walking along chalked
lines, and the demeanor of the officers
Ouring the work demonstrated that the
ritual, though not as grand as in other
orders, can be made very impressive.
Last week the grand chief companion
paid an official visit to Haywards Circle
and found it in good condition, the mem
bership active and earnest.

Market-Street Company
Defies Board of
Works.
Claims Right to Maintain
Rails at Market and
Eddy Streets.
The Market-street Railway Company
sent a communication signed by General
Manager Vining to Benjamin Heath,
chief of the Bureau of Streets, yesterday,
in which the corporation holds that it has
a right to maintain the tracks connecting
Market street with Eddy and will not re
move them. The Board of Public Works
recently sent a communication directing
the company to remove the tracks forth
with. \ ining states in his letter that it
is not only the company's right but its
duty to lay the tracks in question, and
that no forfeiture of franchise has oc
curred.
Accompanying Vining's letter is an opin
ion of Attorney J. E. Foulds, filed with
Road Engineer H. H. Lynch, which is as
follows:
All of the tracks in question were laid by
virtue of order No. 2304 December 33, 1890,
"granting: to Henry Moffatt, J. B. Reinstein
and M. S. Eisner certain privileges since as
signed to the Ferris and Cliff House Railroad
Compans'."
The particular clause of the ordinance hav
ing reference to said tracks reads, "also com
mencing at the intersection of Eddy anditerket
streets, thence along Eddy street." Under the
ordinary rules of construction the intersection
of two streets means the intersection of the
center of the streets. The requirements of
the franchise as to the expenditure of moneys j
in prosecuting the construction of the road
were complied with. The tracks najned have
been used to some extent in transf/rring and
returning: cars and as the conductor of the re
turn electric current. For the reasons stated
I am satisfied that you have the right to main
tain the tracks In question and therefore advise
the demand of the Department of Public
"Works be not complied with.
Immediately on the receipt of the let
ters the Board of Works requested the
City Attorney to advise whether the
terms of the franchise permit the main
tenance of the tracks to connect with
Market street, and if so, whether the
"nonuser" of the tracks has created a
forfeiture of the right to maintain them.
ANCIENT GAME
WELL WORKED
Business Colleges Are
Mulcted by Smooth
Swindler.
A number of the local business colleges
were victims of a smooth swindler dur
ing the past week. The San Francisco,
California and Heald colleges were suf
ferers to the extent of $25 each, and as a
result the police are looking for a smooth
young man of about 21 years, of medium
size, dark complexion and wearing dark
clothes with white vest.
The operations of the young man were
exposed yesterday at the office of Ayres'
Business College in the History building.
He sought to bleed Manager J. L. Wil
liams for $20 on an old* game, but that
gentleman took the precaution to make
a few inquiries before paying the money,
and the exposure followed.
On Saturday Manager Williams re
ceived a letter from one J. Dawson Al
berts of Oakland, announcing that the
writer was desirous of sending his neph
ew to a business college and asking for
the best terms of tuition. The writer de
clared that Ayres' school had been recom
mended to him and that he would send
his nephew to Williams on Monday with
a check to pay tuition fees. The letter
was written on Hotel Metropole paper.
On Sunday Manager Williams telephoned
to that hotel and inquired as to J. Daw
son Alberts. The answer was that no
such person was known about the place.
About 10 o'clock yesterday morning a
young man called upon Manager Williams
and introduced himself as the nephew of
J. Dawson Alberts. He said his uncle
found it impossible to accompany him,
but that he had sent a check to cover all
expenses of entrance into the institution
as pupil. The check exceeded the ex
penses by an even $20, and it was offered
to Williams with the remark that the $20
was intended by the uncle to defray the
board of the young man for one month.
Williams accepted the check, but before
paying the excess went downstairs and
telephoned to the First National Bank of
Oakland, on which it was drawn, only to
make the discovery that no such depositor
as J. Dawson Alberts had an account at
that bank.
Williams returned to the office and
warned the young man to leave the place
at once or suffer arrest. The swindler
said there was some mistake, but he did
not tarry long to make excuses. Wil
liams then telephoned to the San Fran
cisco College and learned that $25 had
been paid to J. Dawson Alberts' nephew
on a check. Healds' College had been
victimized to a like amount, as was also
the California College.
A description of the Bwlndler has been
furnished to the police and a careful
search is now being made for the enter
prising young man.
Companions of the Forest.
The recent open meeting of Loyal Circle
of the Companions of the Forest was a

Laborers.
Ordinance Creating Places
in Registrar's Office
Passed.
A resolution was presented to the Board
of Supervisors yesterday by Braunhart,
fixing the amount of wages to be paid and
regulating the hours of work for laborers
employed by the Park Commissioners, and
on all public utilities now owned or here
after to be acquired by the city.
The reason for the introduction of the
ordinance is that City Engineer Grun
sky's report on the proposed acquisition
of the Geary-street road by the city is
based on the theory that the employes
shall be paid at the rate of 25 cents an
hour. The charter limits a working day
to eight hours, thus insuring an employe
a daily wage of $2. Braunhart's resolu
tion, which was referred" to the Judiciary
Committee, follows:
Section 1. The minimum wages of laborers
in the employ, or hereafter to be employed,
by the Park Commissioners on the lands,
squares and grounds which are designated to
be un.ier the exclusive coptrol and management
of said Commissioners by the charter, is hereby
fixed at $2 50 a day. and eight (S) hours shall
be the maximum hours of l<bor on any calen
dar day.
Section 2. The minimum wages of laborers
employed on any public utility now owned, or
that may be hereafter acquired by the city
and county of San Francisco, is hereby fixed at
$2 50 a day, and eight (8) hours shall be the
maximum nours of labor on any calendar day.
The ordinance creating the positions of
chief deputy and head clerk in the Regis
trar's office was finally passed. Harry
Zemansky and D. J. Gordon, at present
clerks in the office, will be promoted to
the positions, which carry salaries of $150
per month each.
Reed objected to the passage of the or
dinance on the ground that the election
was over and the work of the Registrar's
office would now be at a standstill. The
measure, however, received fifteen votes,
or one more than the necessary fourteen.
Reed alone voting against it.
RUSSELL WANTS
ABSENCE LEAVE
Board of Supervisors'
Clerk Withdraws
Resignation.
John A. Russell, clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, has withdrawn his resigna
tion, which was placed in the hands of
Mayor Phelan last week. The Board of
Supervisors was prepared to accept the
resignation at yesterday's meeting and
to appoinf Charles W. Fay to the va
cancy, but action was forestalled by Rus
sell, who filed a request that he be grant
ed a leave of absence for six months.
Russeil assigns as a reason for his re
quest that his illness necessitates a con
tinuance of absence from his duties. The
veteran clerk believes that- he will be re
stored to health at the end of his leave.
The communication was referred to the
Judiciary Committee to determine if the
board has power to grant a leave for six
months.
Mr. Russell is afflicted with paralysis
of the right side, and his intimate friends
are of the opinion that he will not get
Well. The Mayor doubts whether such a
long lea\e as he asks for to legal under
the charter. There is a disposition to
trtat him with great consideration on ac
count of flis long and faithful service.
The charter provides that no person em
ployed by the city shall be paid for a
greater* length of time than that covered
by actual service.
A resolution was adopted extending an
invitation to Mayor-elect Schmitz and the
newly elected members of the Board of
Supervisors to attend the current sessions
of the board in order to familiarize them
selves with their future duties.
Fire Chief Sullivan's petition that Frank
German's deed of heroism in rescuing
Miss Nellie Healy from a fire at 244 Stev
enson street be suitably rewarded was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
Globe Trotters, Take Notice!
We have new stock of trunks that econ

They're far easier to pack, and as to

FISHER WOULD GIVE
THOUSANDS FOR LICENSE
Trustees of Berkeley Want Him to
Put His Offer in Writ
ing.
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.-The question of
licensing saloons in East Berkeley within
the mile limit came up before the Town
Trustees this evening, and, while thero
was no action taken, the board is at least
seriously considering the matter. It came
up in the shape of a statement from
Trustee Dowd of West Berkeley that Sam
Fisher would give the town $2000 for a
license for a year for a saloon on the
corner of Shattuck avenue and Center
street, the very center of East Berkeley,
and that he would assume all the respon
sibility of the legality of the license.
There was no discussion of the matte*
but President Marston of the Board of
Trustees was appointed a committee of
one to get a written offer from Fisher,
after which the board will consider the
matter. The indications are that the
board will grant the license if Fisher will
assume the expenses of litigation that will
undoubtedly follow. The location pro
posed Is at East Berkeley station. Fisher
is the saloon-keeper who agreed to at
tend the church of Rev. Francis Robin
son if that divine would hold services in
his saloon.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 11.â There was another
day of.tiroad and active speculation in stocks
to-day; and a large and well distributed de
mand for bonds outside of the extraordinary
dealingÂ« in some of the convertible and specu
lative bcndÃ. It is notable in this regard that
â¢while tbÂ« dealings for the last week in sucks
were Â«tHi below the large business of the cor
responding period of last year .the par value
of the honds dealt in last week exceeded (hose
of the corresponding period of last ytar ,by
over J5.000.000. The .demand for stocks to-day
was exceedingly varied, as was the movement
of prices, owing to the fact that the buying
demand shifted to new quarters and realizing
of profits -proceeded actively in last- week's fa
vorites, taking advantage of the sustaining
force of the new favorites. The dealings con
tinued to a large extent to remain in profes
sional hands, although there was some acces
s! in of speculative interest to-day shown by
orders through commission houses. While the
professionals dominate the market, the news
of the day as influencing stock speculation is
likely to be distorted in its perspective to suit
the prevailing sentiment or the speculation.
To-day the Northwestern railroad settlement
and the Vanderbilts' plan of merger, which
furnished the material of the bulls during the
last week's rise, lell into the background de
cidedly, while discussion became very active
on the favorable prospects in the coal trade,
the iron and steel trade and the extraordlr ary
railroad traffic, of which reports are heard on
all hands. In accordance with this tendency,
the coal -carriers . and the iron and steel indus
trials made conspicuous advances to-day while
the professionals sold the transcontinental
stocks and the Vanderbilts to take their prot
its. After the unprecedented outlays of the
past year lor increase and Improvement 01
rolling stock and equipment,- the fact that an
actual car famine exists in many part* of
the country is conclusive evidence that the
business offering to the railroads is greater
than ever. Grain receipts are said to be small
because of lack of cars. This accords with the
reports that the overwhelming railroad â¢ traffic
is largely made up of general merchandise,
due to the activity in trade in all lines. The
urgent demands for freight cars and other
forms of railroad equipment made the move
ment to-day in the car and steel Industrials a
natural corollary of the movement in the rail
road stocks. The day's conspicuous advances
will be seen to have centered in the anthra
cite and sort coal carriers and in the car and
steel industrials. - Sugar and Amalgamated
Copper were affected by an active demand
lrom the shorts, and both stocks were largely
dealt in for Boston account. Union Picnic
erred rose four points, and Great North
ern pjeierred and Northern Pacific preferred
moved upward at the last on revived reports
of an early settlement. Sentiment continued
confident over the money outlook, although
.foreign exchange continued strong and addi
tional gold shipments are expected later In
the week. Realizing became very general in
the late dealings, but a number of rallies
made the closing irregular.
The bond market was active and strong

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 11.â Strength and activity
marked the first of the session in the wheat
pit. At the opening there was such a quanti
ty of bearish information that nearly every one
started in to sell.
Cables were weak, primary receipts showed
500,000 bushels increase and there were also
considerable increases in the amount on pass
age and in the world's visible supply. Added
to this was the news of rains in the districts
where they were most needed. December
opened %@%c higher. Commission houses had
orders that absorbed all that was offered at
any decline and as a result December sold up
to 73% c. At this point, however, longs were
satisfied with profits and began to liquidate,
which eased the market, December closing
steady, a shade under at 72%@73c.
Corn opened higher on Improved cables and
maintained a firm undertone. December closed
firm, %c to %c higher at 59% c. Receipts were
84 cars.
December oats felt the influence of the strong
cash situation. December closed firm %c to %c
higher at 39%@39%c Receipts were 232 cars.
Provisions were dull but steady. Early
weakness in hogs brought a depressed opening,
but the strength in grains brought an improved
tone. January Pork closed 2%c up; January
Lard unchanged and Ribs unchanged.

James A. Herne famous, is drawing large
houses at the California, Though Hern.'
himself is not Nathaniel Berry, the part
is well played ny James T. Galloway, and
his work receives frequent and well-de
etyed applause. The alternate pathetic
and humorous features of rural life are
well portrayed, and the audience easily
I enters into the spirit of it all. Marion
l Â«.u!len. the heroine, has the genuine ac

scenes, which are very cleverly enacted

and th<Â» Stephen Dunbar of Henry Shu

Ollie Cooper is a talented lad and was
called fore the curtain for his clever
acting at the close of the first act. Th-:

FIVE YOUNG LADIES FROM ACROSS THE BAY
ARE TO SING MINOR PARTS IN GRAND OPERA
Miss Anne Louise Daniells, Miss Belle McCurrie, Miss Mamie Fritschie, Miss Emily Collisschon and
Miss Dorothy Mohns, Who Have* Shown Rare Talent in Amateur Entertainments, Have Been
Chosen From Among Many Vocalists Because of Their Fine Talent to Aid Grau Performances
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â There are five
young ladies from this side of the
bay who have been chosen to sing
â¢with the Grau grand opera com
pany at the Grand Opera-house
during the present engagement. This is
no empty honor, for there are many young
ladies on both sides of San Francisco Bay
who are possessors of good voices, but
not all the possessors of good voices have
been chosen to sing with the great stars
of the operatic world.
When it was decided to supply some
of the minor parts for the grand opera
season from among local singers there
was a great effort upon the part of many
to secure permission to appear. It was
recognized that such an appearance would
not only be a recommendation but a lib
eral education as well, and many there
were who were desirous of the permission
to appear. It fell to the lot of only five
young ladles from this side of San Fran
cisco Bay to appear during the season
and all of these young ladies were chosen
because of the reputations that they have
made in local dramatic music. The honor
in every case was conferred entirely be
cause of merit.
Those who have been chosen are Miss
Annie -Louise Danielle. Miss Belle Mc-
Ourrie. Miss Mamie Fritschle, Miss Emily
Collisschon and Miss Dorothy Mohns.
Miss Daniells has been given a most
superb musical education and was offered
c position with the Bostonians, but de
clined; Miss McCurrle has shown her abil
ity in organizing several amateur operatic
performances for charity in Alameda.
Miss Fritschie. Miss Collisschon and Miss
Mohns have taken part in several concerts
3rd amateur musical affairs. None of the
young ladies have appeared upon the pro
! Sessional sta^fc.
DEATH SCOURGES
ALASKAN TRIBES
Disease Continues Its
Awful "Work Among
the Natives.
TORT TOWNSEXD. Wash.. Nov. 11.â
Dunlap Moore, assistant surgeon of the
United States Quarantine Service, who
has been stationed in KomÂ» during the
pasi season, arrived here to-day and con
firms the report that the natives of West
ern Alaska are rapidly being extermin
ated by disease. He says that at lea.st
one-third of the native population at
Cape Prince of Wales. Nome. Port Clar
ence, St. Michael, Kuskokwim. Unalaska,
Pribyloff Islands. Nunivak Island and St.
Lawrence Island and those along the Yu
kon River have suffered from the effects
of an epidemic which at first w,as be
lieved to be smallpox, but upon .investi
gation proved to be measles. The epi
demic of measles, which caused so many
deaths among the natives, originated at
Holy Cross, In Northeastern Siberia, and
from that point It was carried to places
visited by whalers, and the whalers car
ried the disease to the coast of Alaska.
Dr. Moore reports the condition of the
natives as being mon pitiable. In many
entire families of small children
have been left destitute, the mothers and
fathers having perished. In some parts
of Alaska missionaries have established
orphan asylums and are looking after the
orphans, but the ravages of the disease
extend over .such a large area that it in
impossible lo gather up the large num
ber of motherless and fatherless children.
Fischer's Concert House.
At Fischer s Concert House last night
the large audience applauded Floria. a
Spanish dancer, who later reappeared in
poses plastique; Carl and Boyle, triple
horizontal bar performers; Eleanora Jen
kins, the operatic soprano; Swor and
Hathaway, singers and dancers; Sid Bax
ter, an aerial juggler, and William Black,
a musical artist of repute. Bushlaush,
an Arabian acrobat, did some surprising
feats, and Hinrichs' orchestra was up to
its usual excellent standard.

CANALS EXEMPT
FROM TAXATION
Supreme Court Decision
Won by Reclama
tion Districts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 11.â The Supreme
Court, which opened its November term
in this city to-day, handed down a deci
sion this afternoon of great moment to
the many reclamation districts in this
State. It is to the effect that the prop
erty of the reclamation districts is ex
empt from taxation by counties.
The original action was brought by
Reclamation District 551 against the
county of Sacramento to recover money
paid under protest for taxes levied and
assessed by the county upon the property
of the district. It was the contention of
the county that the constitution exempted
from taxation only public schools and
property of the Federal, State, municipal
and county governments; that the prop
erty of reclamation districts was none of
these, and therefore should be taxed
The Supreme Court, however, declares
that the whole scheme of reclamation
originated with the State and is encour
aged in furtherance of public policy The
court observes that the trustees have no
money which they can apply to pay
county and State taxes levied and as
sessed upon the works of the district, and
they have no power to levy assessments
to raise money for any such purpose To
allow the county to assess the canals,
ditches, drains, embankments, pumping
plants, etc., for general taxation purposes
Bay* the court, might lead to the aban
donment of an important undertaking of
the State.
The most valuable fruit land in Sacra
mento County is contained in the down
river reclamation districts.
Decides Against Railway Company.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 11.â The Supreme
Court in bank has reversed the order of
the Superior Court of Alameda County
granting the defendant a new trial in the
case of J. W. Slemsen against the Oak
land, San Leandro and Hayward Railroad
Company. The company alleged miscon
duct on the part of a juror, who is al
leged to havo examined the track during
the trial. The Supreme Court says it ia
not material and the company is not en
titled to a new trial.

"PANTS" THIET VISITS
HOMES IN BERKELEY
Inadequate Police Force in College
Town Fills Citizens With Ap
prehension.
BERKELEY, Nov. 11.â A burglar whose
actions tally closely to those of the
"pants" thief who has been operating in
San Francisco entered two residences in
this city last night and from one obtained
$40 in cash. Nothing was secured from
the other place. These burglaries make
four which have been done on recent
dates evidently by the same person.
Minor thefts have been numerous.
The authorities fear a series of crimes
this winter, as the town force of peace
officers is inadequate. A Marshal and two
deputies only are allowed by the city
government, and as these men are on
duty during the day a night patrol is im
possible except in special oases. The busi
ness and some residence districts have
night watchmen, but a large majority of
the wealthy homes are without police
protection whatever after dark.
W. D. Holcom's residence at 2523 Hille
gass avenue was entered by a burglar last
night. The thief made his way to the
room where Mr. Holcom was sleeping
and carried two pairs of his trousers out
of doors, securing $40 from the pockets of
one. The thief entered F. H. Huddart's
place, a few blocks south, and carried
two pairs of pants from rooms where
men were sleeping and took them to the
back porch, but found nothing of value
in the pockets. The garments were left.
A pants thief recently operated in San
Francisco in the same fashion, and before
that kept the police of San Jose busy.
PRINCETON'S OFFER
HELD IN ABEYANCE
BERKELEY, Nov. 11.â No definite ac
tion was taken to-day by the executive
committee of the student body on Prince
ton's offer to play the California eleven or
a team composed of undergraduates and
alumni. The entire matter has been re
ferred to the football men for considera
tion and if they are willing to go into
training again the executive committee
will undoubtedly authorize the game. On
Wednesday the committee will meet again
and an answer will be sent to Princeton.
Although the offer of the New Jersey
university makes it allowable for alumni
to play the executive committee is op
posed to any but undergraduates com
peting. The members believe that the
men who defeated Stanford should go on
the field again as the representative Cali
fornia team.

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 11.â The special

ninth annual convention of the American
Association of Traveling Passenger
Agents arrived here this evening. There
were 260 delegates from all parts of the
United States, and they will reinforce the
large army of railroad men who had Al
ready arrived.
The Easterners report that they have
had a splendid time on their trip out to
toe coast. This morning they were enter
tained in Redhinds. Taity-ho coaches and
private conveyances were at the station
to meet them and they were driven
around the town. They were shown the
beautiful orange orchards, laden with
fruit, and at tne close of the drive were
entertained at luncheon.
In Riverside also they were taken for
a drive. H. T. Hays acted a* president
of the reception committee. After being
driven around Riverside the Eastern
railroad men could not fully express their
appreciation of California hospitality.
'ihe convention will open to-morrow
morning at 'J o'clock. Tne most impor
tant topics discussed at present are the
election of offfeers and tne selection or
the place for the next meeting. For pres
ident Thomas E. Fitzgeraid, traveling
passenger agent of the Texas and Pacific,
and John C. Blair of Boston, New Eng
land agent of the Illinois Central, art*
running a close race. Fitzgerald is very
popular with railroad men, and the great
work he has done in forming plans fov
the entertainment of his brother agents
on the coast gives him a shade the bet
ter of it in the contest for the important
position.
Sidney Van Dusen, who has been secre
tary and treasurer of the association for
the past two years, will resign. It is al
most certain that T. W. Tandman of De
troit, traveling passenger agent of the
Hocking Valley Railroad, will succeed
him.
Buffalo and Philadelphia both want the
convention next year. It Is a hard fight,
but at present looks as though it will go
to the latter city.
While the convention is being held to
morrow the ladies of the party will take

ket streets, for the depot. The oarty ar
rived at Sixteenth-street station just in
time to catch the train. Harland, hidden
away behind the station, saw his sweet
htart board the train under the watch
ful eyes of her guardians.
He despaired of seeing her again, when
suddenly, as the train was slowly leaving
the station, the girl raised the window at
her seat, plunged through and made her
escape. The train was stopped and the
mother and grandmother pursued, but not
until to-day was the couple's biding placÂ«
found.
Upon the showing that the runaway girl
was under legal age, Chief Hodgkins tooix
charge of the case. Harland was detained
at the City Prison, and Miss Montejo anu
her relatives had a long conference. Th>i
young woman insisted upon being per
mitted to wed her soldier lover, and h*
was only too delighted. After a few
hours' imprisonment Harland was freed,
and a wedding will shortly follow aa a
result of the girl's escapade of last night.
Harland has recently been employed by
the People' 3 Express Company.
The theatrical supe ought to have a
salt and pepper suit.

VERY BAD DAY
FOR DIMMICK
Witness Says He Banked
Public Funds in His
Own Name.
No Testimony Offered for the
Defense and Argu
ment Begins.
Walter N. Dimmick, ex-chief clerk of
the Mint, had a bad day yesterday in the
United States District Court. The first
dark cloud was the appearance' of C/ M.
Hawkins, a merchant of Hollister. Mr.
Hawkins, it appears, had purchased bhie
stone irom the Mint, in payment I for
which he sent to the Mint a cneck for
Hj>4 <j2. ihe second cloud was the testi
mony of oeorge L.. Smitn ot ells, Fargo
tv to.'s Bank, to whom Dimmick on Oc
tober Iâ¬. li*x>, gave this very check for
5164 vi, having it credited to . nimself per
bonaily on the books of the bank.
Ihis evidence was introduced for thÂ«
purpose of proving that Dimmick had
embezzled the sum mentioned. .. , .
Another important bit of evidence cor
roborating the testimony of Superintend
ent l^ach that Dimmick hud confessed
to him his guilt was furnished by W. K.
Oossup, paying teiler of the San Fran
cisco .National Bank. Mr. Gossup swore
that on February 19. I'-'jl, Dimmick pre
sented his personal check to the bank and
un \v therefrom 5133&. This was the very
sum that Dimmick pad on the same day
to Superintendent Leach to make good his
defalcation.
Ueprge D. Collins, counsel for the de
lendaiu, raised objection after objection
lÂ« this evidence on the ground that it
was irrelevant and Immaterial and that
tiie roper foundation had not been laid
lor its introduction. Upon the objections
liting overruled by Judge de Haven and
i lk- evidence admitted Mr. Collins moved
to strike it out and the court granted the
motion. . .
No evidence for the defense was sub
roittod. .and to the surprise of the specta
tors Mr. Dimmick did not take the wit
nep^ and.
â¢ Bert Schlesinger of special counsel for
the Government made the opening argu
ment for the prosecution. Mr. Collins will
reply for the defense this morning, and
ex-Judge S. C. Denson will close for the
Government
There is no other indictment pending
against Dimmick, but the incoming-
United States Grand Jury will be asked
to indict Dimmick for stealing $30,000 from
the Mint, the former indictment having
been Quashed on account of errors.

Can Play "Belle of New York."
The threatened injunction suit against
the Pollard Juvenile Company to stop
their presentation of "The Belle of New
York" was settled yesterday. Sam Schu
bert of the Herald Square Theater, New
York, directed A. J. Pollard, business
manager of the company, to see Manager
George Lederer about securing the rights
for this country and arrangements were
accordingly made. Schubert has a com
pany on the road playing the piece, for
which he pays Lederer a royalty, but
thought his rights only held good as re
gards his own productions. Later on he
discovered that his contract gave him the
exclusive rights, hence the threatened in
junction. The Pollards and the Tivoli
management kept the wires busy yester
day and an amicable arrangement was
finally reached whereby the Australian
juveniles will continue to present the mu
sical comedy on their American tour.
Lost Sack of Gold.
D. W. Frischl, grocer. Eighteenth
street and Clara avenue, reported to the
police yesterday that on the morning of
November 4 some one stole a sack con
taining $30 in gold, which he had behind
his counter. He suspects a young man
who lives in the neighborhood and knew
where the money was kept. The young
man has disappeared since the loss of th^
sack.

ADVERTISEMENTS. _
IN OLD AGE th e question of health
" ****** becomes mainly a
question of nutrition. If the stomach
and other organs of digestion and nutri-
tion are kept in a healthful condition
there will be a well-nourished body, and
little liability to disorders of the liver,
bowels or such other disorders as may
result from in- m
nutrition and

cise. A A

Â¦ I was a sufferer from chronic diarrhea for five
years.' 1 writes Mrs. Mcry A. Aaron, of Rolla,
Phclps Co., Mo. "I tried different remedies
which would give me relief for a short time
only. My trouble would return as bad as ever.
I consulted you in Tuly. 1900, and by your advice
commenced using Dr. Pierces remedies. I took
two bottles of" the ' Golden Medical Discovery,'
three vials of the ' Pellets,* and some of the
Â¦ Extract, of Smart-Weed,' as you advised. I
have not had any return of my trouble since
using your medicines. Am now seventy-one
years old and I never had anything to relieve
Â»c so quick. I f jink Dr. Pierces medicines the
greatest on earth. Should I ever have any re-
turn of my trouble shall use your medicine.
My thanks to you for your, advice and thanks
to' Almighty God for restoring: me to health
through your hands." *

FEDERAL PLUMS
IN CALIFORNIA
Removal of Lynch Only
Important Change
Probable.
Senator Bard May Not Come
Here Eefore He Goes to
Washington.
Senator Eard will probably go direct
from Southern California to Washington,
D. C. 11 was his intention two weeks ago
to visit San Francisco before leaving the
State for the national capital, but word
\i^ received yesterday that he had
changed his mind in this respect.
It is quite well understood that Senators
Bard and Perkins have agreed that a
change in the office of Collector of Inter
nal Revenue, First District of California,
is not only desirable, but is demanded.
Politicians say that the State administra
tion will take care of John C. Lynch in
the event of his removal from Federal of
fice. It is claimed by the "push" that
Governor Gage will appoint Lynch to the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners, to
succeed Herold. if Perkins and Bard taJce
the Collector's scalp.
Before the recent municipal election
Senator Perkins seemed to apprehend that
Lynch exerted great influence in directing
the vote of liquor men in general and the
brewers in particular, but that apprehen
sion vanished when the returns came in.
li is now obvious that Lynch's influence
was greatly ovei rated, because it was In
voked to the utmost limit to save Wells
from defeat. When Governor Gage pauses
to reflect that Lynch's appointment to the
Harbor Board would be construed as a
direct affront to thousands of Independent
anti-boss Republicans, he may decide to
look over the Held again before picking
out Herold"s successor.
Will Be Few Changes. \
Indications are that there will not be
many changes in the Federal office-hold
ing force. Collector Stratton was com
missioned for a term of four yeais, and
there is no thought of a, change in that
direction. Congressman Julius Kahn is
anxious that W. W. Montague should be
returned as Postmaster of San Francisco.
Superintendent Leach of thje United States
Mint is Senator Perkins' particular friend.
It is known that President McKinley's
fiiendsnip for Joseph Spear Jr., Surveyor
of Customs, was so sincere and outspoken
that the latter received personal assur
ance of reappointment. United States
Marshal Shine was pretty close to the
bosses in the recent campaign, but he is
probably sorry now and may endeavor
to get in closer touch with the better and
winning elements of the party. The re
moval of John C. Lynch was decided upon
immediately after the election of Sena
tor Bard. If State Senator Rowell could
have been persuaded to accept the posi
tion the change would then have been
made. Dr. Rowell, however, aimed
higher and expressed an inclination to
serve his country as United States Minis
ter to Japan.
All along the line one hears the talk
that the bosses intend to make one des
perate effort to overthrow the present
primary election law.
Primary Law Again.
A well-known and influential Republican
from the interior remarks:
"If the Supreme Court holds that this
primary law is unconstitutional, I shall
be in favor of calling a constitutional con
vention to make a constitution that will
give us a primary law."
If the primary law stands the Repub
licans of San Francisco will send repre
sentatives of the best citizens of the party
to the next State Convention. If the court
declares the law unconstitutional, the
bosses, having control of the county com
mittee and the State committee of the
party, may get together secretly in the
Palace Hotel or Herrin's office and put
up a list of delegates. Before that time
comes the public will get a true inside re
port of what recently took place in the
boss camp. When the business of nomi
nating a candidate for Mayor was on
hand as raw a proposition as referring the
matter in its entirety to Hearst was ac
cepted. Subsequently one of the bosses
made a great dissenting roar and the pro
gramme was reconsidered.
Ex-Assemblyman Webber of Napa
ought to come to San Francisco and ex
hibit in this city the gold brick which he
received from Govenor Gage. He has
been showing the prize package in sev
eral of the northern counties, and there
seems to be no good reason why it shouid
not be exhibited in the metropolis.
Off for Mexico.
The number of inquiries now being reg
istered at Southern Pacific ticket office
by applicants for berths on the second
annual holiday excursion to the City of
Mexico December 18 indicates that the
trip is going to prove a very popular one.
The old-time attractions of Mexico have
not been dimmed by contact with outer
civilization.
The Christmas season there is highly
colored by many brilliant and imposing
ceremonies, both civic and religious, con
tinuing for several days. No better op
portunity could be found for making a
trip to the southern republic.
MISS WADHAM WANTS
HER PBOPERTY BACK
'Â¦ Dr. W. Burgess Estes, Arrested for
Embezzlement, Threatens to Sue
His Own Mother.
Miss Bertha Wadham, daughter of Lu
man Wadham, 190j Leavenworth tetreet,
swore out a warrant in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday for the arrest of Dr. \V.
Burgess Estes on the charge of misde
meanor embezzlement. She accuses him
of embezzling a lady's gold watch, silver
chain and two gold fobs, which she
loaned him "to flash" around with. lie
had been a guest at her father's house
for some months.
Estes was arrested yesterday afternoon
and declared that it was a case of spite
work on the part of Miss Wadham, be
cause he had not married her. He assert
ed that she had done everything in her
power to induce him to marry her, but
he had preferred Mrs, Collins, a divorced
woman, whom he married two weeks ago.
He says he has letters to prove that Miss
Wadham presented him with the articles,
which were now in the possession of his
assistant. Miss Wadham 2ad been in
sulting his wife, and all he wanted was
to be let alone, he said.
Estes declares that his mother and
others have conspired to ruin him be
cause of Ms marriage, and he intends to
bring suits for libel against her and his
other alleged defamers. Estes got into
trouble recently by passing worthless
checks on the Press Club, but his family
came to his rescue.
Nolan's Heirs Charge Fraud.
The heirs at law of James Nolan filed
an objection yesterday to the claim upon
the estate mad', by Mary Nojan in her
first annual report as administratrix of the
estate. The contested claims are for
moneys drawn from the estate by Mary
Nolan under an order of court, which
empowered her to draw $25 per montu
from the estate as a family allowance.
The heirs contest the payment of the al
lowance on the ground that the order of
the court was obtained by means of false
and fraudulent statements. The heirs
deny that Mary Nolan was ever the wife
of, James Nolan, the deceased, and that
therefore she has no claim upon the es
tate.

I WIDELY KNOWN POLICE OFFICER WHO IS PROMINENTLY MENTIONED AS THE PROBABLE SUCCESSOR
OF THE LATE WILLIAM P. SULLIVAN JR. AS CHIEF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT,
I WITH WHICH HE HAS LONG BEEN CONNECTED.
A FEELING of grloom pervaded the
Police Department yesterday,
and the expressions of sorrow
at the death of Chief Sullivan
were universal. Although the
fact that he was supposed to be dying
was published last Friday, the news of his
demise came as a great shock to the mem
bers of the force and his friends, who
clung: to the hope that his strong physical i
constitution might cheat the grim reaper I
of his prey.
Resolutions eulogizing the memory of
the late Police Chief Sullivan were adopt
ed by the Board of Supervisors yesterday
and the board adjourned out of respect
to the dead official. The resolutions ara
as follows:
Resolved. That we. the members of the
Board of Supervisors of the city and county
of San Francisco, have heard with profound
sorrow of the untimely death of "William P.
Sullivan Jr.. Chief of Police, whose personal
virtues, fidelity to duty and consclentiutis ser
vice as a public officer have endeared him to
ue all; and as an expression of respect and
condolence, be it further
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors at
tend the obsequies of the late Chief of Police,
and that when this board adjourn it adjourn
out of respect to his memory, and that these
resolutions be entered in the journal and an
engrossed copy thereof be sent to his bereaved
family. â¢
The family has asked Captain Wittman,
acting chief, to take charge of all â¢ the \
funeral arrangements, and yesterday
morning he issued the following circular:

painstaking and conscientious commander and
his bereaved relatives a dutiful son and a lov

to the shorn lamb" will look down on them
with pity and compassion in this, their hour of
deep sorrow and desolation.
In respect to him It Is ordered that all sta- l
tlon houses be draped in mourning for a period

Bright's Disease Caused Death.
An autopsy was performed at the resi
dence yesterday morning by Professor
Alonzo Taylor of the University of Cali
fornia, assisted by Drs. Louis Bazet and
James Gellwey. It showed that Bright's
disease was the cause of death. A pe
culiar condition of the sternum was dis
closed. The bone was honeycombed, and
there were effusions, to locate the cause
of which will require research.
Captain Seymour yesterday received the
following telegram from Robert A. Pin
kerton, New York:
With sincere regret I hear of the death of
Chief Sullivan. Please convey to his family my
deepest sympathy in their loss.
Seymour also received the following dis

Samuel W. Cheyney, the mining man,
who is being sued for maintenance by

at one time thought a great deal of the
lady if the letters he wrote to her are
a truthful expression of his feelings.
Mrs. Cheyney offers in support of her
present at the time of the marriage ex
cept Cheyney and herself, and that the
ceremony was performed according to
Quaker rites, which provide for the utter
ance by the parties interested of certain
words and by both kneeling in silent
prayer.
Mrs. Cheyney offers in support of her
! claim a letter written to a .Miss Prown
i ing, a mutual friend, in whicn Cneyney
I reters to the plaintiff as his littie
"wiffle."
Cheyney claims that while the letter
] was written by him he never wrote
i the word "withe," and that the word he
| had written was "sufferer." The letter
was submitted to Judge Slosa for exam-
I ination yesterday.

POLICE ARREST
TWO SUSPECTS
Supposed Slayers of Otto
Ekberg Are in the
City Prison.
By the arrest of two men named Riley
and McDonald last night the police bo
lieve they have the murderers of Otto Ek
berg, the non-union teamster who was
foully murdered at Third and Townser.J
streets Saturday evening. Riley answers
the description given of the murderer by
Mrs. Miller, who was the only eye-witness
to the bloody crime. McDonald, the po
lice claim, was with Riley when he strucn
the fatal blow. x
Since the commission of the brutal mur
der Captain Seymour has had Detectives
Tom Gibson and Hammill working on tho
case. Yesterday afternoon they found
the owner of the piece of gaspipe whica
was used by the assassin, and through the
information given by him they arrested
Riley. Shortly afterward the detectives
arrested McDonald at his home near the
vicinity of the murder and locked him up
in the "tanks."
When questioned about the murder tho
prisoners emphatically denied any connec
tion with the crime. Riley declared that
he was at his home when the unfortunate
teamster was struck down, but his state
ment is not corroborated by his mother.
She admitted to the detectives that her
son did not arrive home until unusually
late on the nignt of the murder.
From the evidence which they have in
their possession both Gibson and Ham
mill are satisfied that they have the men
who slayed Ekberg.

Canvassing the Returns.
The official canvass of the returns of
votes cast at the last municipal electloa
was commenced yesterday by the Board
of Election Commissioners. Two dip
tricts, the Twenty-eighth and Twenty
ninth, were canvassed, and only a few
slight discrepancies between semi-official
and official returns were discovered. Late
in the afternoon the friends of Thomas
F. Eagan, candidate for Recorder on tho
Union Labor party ticket, were Jubilant
over a supposed gain of 61 votea. Ho
was credited on the tally sheet of the
Eleventh Precinct of the Twenty-ninth
District with 17 votes, when examination
showed that he was entitled to 78. An
examination of the semi-offlcial returns
showed that he was credited with tho
proper number, and his gain was wiped
out.

MAN TO LEAVE
Major Carroll Mercer to
Get a Diplomatic
Mission.
Well-Known Officer Comes
of Distinguished An
cestry.
Major Carroll Mercer, who has been
stopping at the Palace, leaves for Wash
ington to-day, whence, it is rumored, he
is to be sent on an Important diplomatic
mission. Major Mercer comes of a dis
tinguished line of ancestry and has seen
active service at the capture of Santiago,
in Porto Rico and in the Philippine Isl
ands. Previous to his appointment to V -'W
unteer service at the outbreak; of tile
Spanish-American war he was a commis
sioned officer in the marine corps. Just
after his promotion to a lieutenancy he
was married to Miss Tunis, a young lady
prominent in Wasnington society, and re
signed to enjoy private life.
In I*9B he was given a captaincy In the
commissary department, lr. 1Â»!*9 he came
to San i< rancisco and acted aa purchasing
commissary under Colonel Baldwin. He
was then ordered to Manila, where he
took charge of the sales depot of the old
Department of the Pacific and Eighth
Army Corps. His work there was very
efficient and he was highly commended
by both Generals Otis and McArthur. In
January of the present year he again
came to California and was appointed
chief commissary of the discharge and
casual camps at the Presidio.
Major Mercer ia said to have been one
of the most popular officers in the serv
ice and is much liked by all whose good
fortune it has been to meet him. Hi 3
great-grandfather was an intimate friend
of Washington, and among the family
heirlooms are numerous letters from the
father of his country. Nine blood rela
tions have been Governors of Maryland
and scores of others have held positions
of great responsibility under the Govern
ment.
Major Mercer is himself a member of
the Cincinnati, the most exclusive society
in this country and the only one which
is recognized abroad. It was founded by
Washington and Lafayette and only com
missioned officers were eligible to mem
bership. At present only direct descend
ants of the original members are adn^Â£^
ted. Major Mercer was for several yearÂ»
a shipmate of the brother of Emma
Eames, who is now singing in San Fran
cisco. He leaves a multitude of club,
army and other friends behind him in
California.
