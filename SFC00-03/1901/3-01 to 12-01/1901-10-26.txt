for the workingmen . of San Francisco fell
with the customary dull thud upon un
appreciative ears.
The" workingmen of the Thirty-first Dis-.

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY,; OCTOBER 26, 1901.
The San Francisco Call.Honest Discharge of Duty if Elected
HAS BUT ONE PLEDGE
~ TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE
As between two such candidates as he and
Mr. Wells one would have to cohose neither.
Luckily we can choose neither, and still can
vote for good, honest, progressive government
and for government on* the American plan.
Mr. Tobin In these respects Is "as strong and
as straightforward and as desirable a candi
date as his opponents are weak and impossible.
He is leading the labor forces, the Germans,
the Irishmen, the employers, the Primary
League," and is champion of labor. (Laughter
and applause.) Why, the man is more than a
musician, he Is a whole orchestra.
You all remember the Primary League.
Mr.^Schmitz was a member of the Primary
League, : but he was not annihilated by the
defeat.- You have all seen the gentleman In
the orchestra who plays the triangle and the
cymbals and the drum, and you know the fa
cility with which' he lays down one and takes
up the other. , Mr. Schmitz is playing that
very orchestra.
I am told that Mr. Schmitz Is a very fine
musician. Indeed, he is proving it to us every
day by the skill with which he is playing on
all these different strings in the campaign
He is asking the Germans to vote for him be
cause his name is Schmitz and because he be
longs to a German society, and he is asking
the Irish to vote fpr him because he has Irish
relatives, and he is asking the . employers to
vote for him because he owns a prosperous
manufacturing business, and he is asking
union men to vote for him because In spite of
the fact that he owns a prosperous manufac
turing business he belongs to a union and
holds a Job which otherwise ?ome man not for
tunate enough to own a manufacturing busi
ness would have.'
John H. Marble of the Typographical
Union was next introduced and spoke in
thoughtful, earnest" strain, and in spite
of cries of. "Delmas" toward the end of
his speech, was listened to attentively and
finished amid rousing oheers.
He called the attention of his auditors
to the importance of electing a Mayor
and Board of Supervisors pledged to the
acquisition, of public utilities. He spoke,
he sa.d, as a union. man to union men
Speaking of Schmitz, he said:

Head of the Labor

At this point Mr. Tobin appeared upon
the platform. The audience arose, en
masse and cheered ' the/ candidate- for
Mayor repeatedly. Budd, about to take his
seat, was recalled by shouts of "Go dn,
Jim," but' said: '
"You said/Go ahead, Jim'; you meant
'Joe.* didn't you?"
Governor Budd then introduced Mr. To
bin as the next Mayor of San Francisco,
When the cheering, which lasted several
minutes, had subsided, Tobin addressed
the meeting as follows: i:\\ r _.;< - : *
They eay, my union friend, that you will
vote for Mr. Schmidt. Why? Because he Is
a union man? Is that any reason? I myself
am as firm a believer In unions and always
have been as anybody in the world. I believe
in them so strongly that I would fortify them
by law and cause them to be Incorporated so
that they might not only represent labor lt
eelf. but be responsible for any wrongdoings
of their organization.
TTnions are the conservators of labor and
they are the protectors of capital. But they
never can in this world fulfill their purposes
by going into politics as an independent, sep
erate party. (Applause.)
I say the unions make a mistake. That Is
not their province. Neither capital on the one
fide, nor labor on the other, as organizations,
have any right in politics. Each has a right
lo protect itself from aggrandizement of
vicious men and vicious parties.
* The fight to-day, my friends. Is between
Bchmltz, the Primary Republican League and
Mr. Tobin, WflU is not in it. You may have
some doubt about this proposition, " but when
you go around town and ask your \u25a0 neighbor
quietly, who Is perfectluy .willing to discuss the
proposition with you. "Who are you going to
vote for for Mayor?" I don't; think ;you will
find very many that are going to %-ote for Mr.
Wells. I think that you will find that the ma
jority are going to vote for Mr. Tobin (Ap
plause.) The vote will stand: Tobin first,
Schmitz second and Wells flagged. (Laughter
and applause.) ~ - \u25a0-
I agreed when I got up here this evening to
talk that I wouldn't speak over liveâ minutes,

The chairmanâ Well, you have heard the next
Mayor. Now, ladies and gentlemen, what do
you think of him? (Renewed cheering.) He
talked -like a man from the shoes up, didn't
he? (Cheers and cries of "You bet!") You
didn't see any of the Knglish dude about him.
That gentleman talks like a man. He Is an
athlete. Ke goes out in the field and Is not
afraid of tumbling off a horse and breaking his
neck playing polo and having somebody say he
is, English for doing it. I would rather see him
playing polo on the back of a mustang than
standing on the corner smoking cigarettes. It
is a manly sport and gives him vigor to go
about his business. He Is young. He tells you
to drive him out of the hall. No man of his
position in the community, of his age, : of his
antecedents -can afford to surrender that which
the people of his native city have given to him
This man, if .elected Mayor, will make the best
Mayor that iSan Francisco has ever had or
ever will have. (Cheers.)
This man, If elected Mayor, will be the
Mayor of the city and" will bring to this city
the trade of the Pacific, the islands of the
sea. of the Orient, and the Russian trade,
lie Is a commercial man in commercial busi

Delmas, Delmas). We will give you one more

starts In you never will leave your seats 1 . He
is the greatest orator in the United States
and I have heard them all. I now desire to
Introduce to you a member of the Typographi
cal Union, Mr. Marble.
After mildly .rebuking. those whose 1 cries"
of "Delmas" 'had interrupted the former
speaker and begging for himself an un
interrupted hearing, Delmas spoke as-fol
lows: - ;.-â¢ : '' . . . Y ,
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: : -Since
my residence is in the Valley of Santa Clara
and there my voting; place, and since â¢ I own
little property in thia city and- can exercise
here no political rights, some may be; tempted
to ask whether I <io not realize that my ap

elate that I am attempting to lake a hand In
matters not of my concern. To such my reply
must be that these very grounds were urged
by me uuon the gentlemen who" were kind
enough to extend to me the Invitation to ad
dress you this evening, and that they in their
wisdom saw proper to overrule them/. ..:\u25a0
Upon reflection I cannot but believe-that thero
are some good and proper grounds- to.: justify
their decision. A -year and more . ago it. was
my privilege standing on these very' boards- to:
meet the assembled people of this city,: crowd
ing then as they do now every available spot
in this snacious hall, and to address them
upon the great principle of democracy. From
that day to this whenever called upon. to raise
my voice in the same cause I have never, re
mained silent. It would ill have become â¢â¢ me,
therefore, to refuse now. The principles in
volved in this election areâ I use the word In
its broad sense as indicating a system ofgov
ernments, and not in its narrow and political
meaningâ democratic. As outlined., by public
opinion the issue is, shall the future govern
ment of this city be honest or corrupt? Shall'
it be intrusted to men selected by 'the people
representing the interests of the . people i and
the whole people, or shall it be turned over to
those who have been selected "by ' political
schemers to obey the behests and further the
narrow and selfish Interests , of a few.-.con
scienceless corporations, or even > shall It 'be
intrusted to those who, selected .from a special
nnd exclusive class, are to -wield 'it fpr., the
particular interest of that class? . ;.'.-'â¢ .-'*^V.J
If this be the Issue the battle .then, is truly
between the principle of true democracy on ; the
one side and. the' principle- opposed 1 to true

that ticket which happens to have been placed
before the people by the regularly organized
Democratic party of this. city. I have come
to do so, because the interests of good govern
ment, in my opinion, require it. I have come
to do so because the welfare of this' city, In
my judgment, depends upon the issue of to-day.
I desire ' to address a few i words to the men
who belong to' each of the recognized political
parties now In the field. \u25a0 \u25a0 ' | . \u25a0â¢ \u25a0
I shall begin with you Republicans. To you,
the honest and independent Republican voters
of this city, I shall first speak. I know that
In national political Issues we do not agree.
Our difference may be waived, for none of those
Issues are here Involved. Taking a broader
view of our relations and political faiths, how
ever, there is one point upon which we cer
tainly are at one. You claim as the greatest
Republican your illustrious founder, Abraham
Lincoln. I look upon him as the greatest Dem
ocrat. ' There must, then, be something com
mon between us. What Is It? I believe It Is
this: Lincoln's broad and generous humanity;
his constant love of the'.plaln people and'un
swerving devotion to their Interests; the'dedl
catlon of his life to' the enforcement of the doc
trine of ' the universal equality of man; his
struggle for good government and pure and
exalted political faiths. > ;. \u25a0-:-
Reading your duty by the light of
the great principles which governed
him, can you see your way clear, my
Republican friends, to supporting the
ticket which the Republican organi
zation places to-day before the people
of this cityP ." ; ' }
. Let me . begin with the nominees for Super
visors. I do not know them; am /not aware
that I have even heard their names. I have
been told and have read that there Is a sprink
ling of g-ood men among them. - But, accord-
Ing to the Judgment of. those most competent
to pass upon the subject, ' they are, taken in
the mass, most unfit to constitute the legisla
tive power of this metropolis. \u25a0 Take first the
Judgment of your candidate for Mayor, : Mr.
Wells. In its issue of the 22d of the present
month The San Francisco Call quotes Mr.
Wells as saying: . . . ; ;.; -2t*
"If I had seen the list of names (of nomi
nees for the Board of Supervisors upon the
Republican ticket) I would no more have ac
cepted the nomination . (for Mayor) than give
up my hope of going to heaven wheji I die." \u25a0
This statement has never been denied by Mr.
Wells.' On the contrary, when confronted with
it he has remained silent, and by his silence
confirmed its accuracy. â¢ In the judgment of the
head of the ticket, then, his associates well
deserve the appellation of political highbinders
which was conferred upon them by the Chron
icle in Its Issue of the 15th of this month. - . if.
CALLS SOME NOMINEES
POLITIC AL HIGHBINDEBS
Candidate Wells' Demand, for. Their
Removal Was Peremptorily. De

"Wnat, Indeed, do these candidates, according
to .the best Republican authority, stand for?
In its issue of the lath -of this month the
Chr6nicle. after asserting that these men were
selected largely from disreputable â¢ walks oÂ£
life, and followed In the main disreputable or
degrading occupations, asserts that "they have
subscribed to the following programme: â¢ â¢
To repeal the sidedoor ordinance. \u25a0' .. -.
' To repealthe anti-pool selling ordinance. '
To open Ingleside to unlimited racing. â¢ -
..To renew the Geary-street railway franchise

To give all contracts for city lighting to the
old gas and electric light , company, and to
keep out all Interlopers. "" , ' .
I To let the telephone company do as It pleases
and refuse franchises to all' rivals." -.'
This statement of. the Chronicle is repeated'
in its issue of a week later, and has never been
contradicted to this date. It \u25a0 is no wonder
then, that your candidate for Mayor,' In-sur
veying- this motley crowd of highbinders ex
pressed something of the \u25a0 same feelings \u25a0 that

Our friend Wells the other evening. I believe
in this hall, told the citizens who listened to
him that in order to accomplish any results
it was necessary that the Mayor and the Board
of Supervisors ought to be of the same po
litical party.
Then If all that is conceded, according to
Mr. Wells, to take him at his own words, he
Is not in It. If he has already filed a certificate
of nomination;""and that fact I really doubt.
Two and a half cents for car fare. Have
vou thought of that? Have the people south
of Market street thought of what two and a
half cents each day for a school child means?
Five cents a day, if they go and take their
lunch to school with them. Five cents a day;
a quarter a week; more than a dollar a month;
more than twelve dollars a year for any one
child that a man wants to send to the public
tchools. If for no other reason in the world
than that this Board of Supervisors and Mr.
Tobin, who is one of the members, should be
re-elected. (Applause.) For two children it
will be twice as much, and the amount saved
to each man, each mechanic, each laborer, each
union man, is more than sufficient to pay the
entire tax. In ninety-nine cases out of a hun
dred, that he pays for the eupporÂ» of .this mu
nicipality.
He is a member of the present Board of Su
pervisors, and as such is one of thoÂ»2 to whom
the credit is due for the srood work of the
present board. He has already served the city
of San Francisco as its Mayor pro tempore.
You will remember that as president of the
Board of Supervisors he Is Mayor during the
Absence of the Mayor and as such has dis
charged the duties of the office.
The office of Mayor is the most Important in
the State of California. I do not except that
of Governor of the State. San Francisco is
one-fourth of California* â¢ As San Francisco
thrives, as it grows, as it prospers, the State
of California must thrive and grow and pros
per. San Francisco needs a man of experience
in this particular line, a man of energy, a man
of ability. To-day we are looking across the
\u25a0waters of the Pacific to the Russian railroad
that Is about to turn loose into the vessels
that will meet it there the commerce of Eu
rope. We are looking to the Orient, we are
looking to the islands of the sea for an im
mense volume of trade. If the city of San
Tr&ncisco can get that trade It will be a.

There is no more doubt of the election of Mr.
Tobin than there was *f my election when I
ran for Governor of this State. And the very
same people that did not think that I was too
much of a. dude to receive the labor vote
'south of Market street are the ' very same

election of next November and make him
Mayor of San Francisco. (Cheers.) And why
not? He Is a young man born and raised
among you. of a father that worked his way
up by toil from a laborine man to a position
of affluence. He is a man of ability, integrity
and intelligence. He is a lawyer of experience
and education. *"-:

ar.d his heart and his tools than a man who
happens to be the attorney for a bank, as my
Iriend Sir. Tobin, the next Mayor of San
Francisco, is. (Applause and cries of "Sure."}
and again In the course of this campaign, and
1 repeat it now, this Is not a political issue;
it is a business issue. Every man who has his
money Invested in San Francisco, who owns
property In San Francisco, who has hia chil
dren at school in San Francisco is interested in
this campaign, not as a political partisan, but
as a man and citizen Interested in the welfare
of San Francisco. (Applause.)
I have pone about during the past few weeks,
and It has been to me a liberal education. I
have gone about among- all the classes, all, the
professions and all the grade* of society; .and,
while the Interviews that I have had have been
more than encouraging to me politically., they
have been a source of honest pride to me In
another respect. Almost every manâ that I
have met when he has been interrogated as
to his political leanings has replied: "In na
tional affairs I am a Democrat" or "I am a
Republican," as the case may be, "but In mu
nicipal life I consider who Is the honest man
and who will best discharge his duty free from
the Influence of corporate aggression." (Ap
plause.) I say, gentlemen, that is a source of
pride to me and should be a source of pride
to each one of us. It shows tnat the seed that
has been Eown ie bearing- fruit, that men no
longer look upon their ticket to find the dis
tinctive mark Republican or Democrat.- but
they look for the distinctive mark, of honesty
cr dishonesty. (Cheers.) As I have traveled
from place to place in the city of Saw Fran
cisco it makes no difference whether the man
stood before the door of a xurnace with dis
tended veins \u25a0 and Eet muscles or -whether he
\u25a0worked in the heated shop, or whether he sat
at a merchant's desk, the invariable reply has
been, '.'We want practical business men in
office, men that we know are not bound by
any pledge, men that we know do not owe their
nominations to the influence of corporations or
bosses, but men who have been chosen for the
reputation they bear as men, free. Independent
and honest."
Ladies and Gentlemen: I am in this fight to
win. (Cheers.) I am in this fight to work to
win. I hope to win by all honorable, manly
means. ,But If to win I must descend to per
sonalities: if to win I must pledge my honor
to get votes; if to win I must bow my neck to
a corporation power; if to -win I must. forfeit
my place as an honest, reputable citizen â then.
In the words of that great warrior of *;ivic
virtue, that great political leader. Samuel J.
Tilden. if that be the cost, gentlemen, then let
me retire and take my place In the ranks of
my plundered fellow* citizens. (Great cheer-
Ing.) I shall win, but not at such a cost. I
shall win, I .hope, without forfeiting an ounce
of the respect that any man in the audience
had for me when I. started this campaign. (Ap
plause.) And, ladies and gentlemen. If I do
win. at .the end of two years, I hope to see
such an audience as this, and if I have in any
way abused the trust that you have placed in
me; if I have betrayed my honor as a citizen;
if I have sold myself to a corporation; if I
have cast my honor before a boss â then, ladies'
and gentlemen, I hope you will rise up and'
drive me In dishonor and disgrace from this
hall. (Round after round of cheers for Tobin,
the audience rising to their feet.)
RECORDS OF SUPERVISORS
MUST INSURE RE-ELECTION
LET me briefly enumerate the' services by" which this Board of Supervisors have : entitied
themselves to your recognition of their services. They have decreased taxation and'
brought the rate to the lowest point reached by any large American city; : They liave
permitted no property of any kind to escape taxation, enforcing the public burdens ;
equally upon the rich and the poor, equally upon powerful corporations and defenseless indi
viduals. They have also lowered water rates, thereby effecting a saving of $270,600' -to the
city. " They have lowered gas and electric light rates and vastly improved the service:' They
have, while keeping within the dollar limit, saved $655,000 for streets, sewers, public im
provements and schoolhouses. They have saved and economized $320,000 to pay school
teachers and creditors of the city for old indebtedness. In fine, as if to, place a .-final, and.
worthy crown upon their services, they have reduced the carfare to two and one-half cents
for school children, enabling the offspring of the poorest among you to avail themselves at
the smallest possible cost of all the advantages of your admirable School Department.âEx

And right hero the Important question arises:
Whose ordertf V has Mr. . Wells obeyed In this
matter?- Whose orders Is he obeying, now?
Whose â¢> orders - is - he \u25a0 likely to obey - hereafter ?
It â¢ is . strongly suggested in the . Bulletin' s ar
ticles ; that - the \ men * whose orders Mr. , Wells
has | followed ; In â¢ this ! matter so far are \u25a0'- a > Mr.
Max*. Goldbergâ whom . I-- may : bo -r pardoned
for . never having heard of beforeâ and another

On the 3d of this month the San Francisco
Bulletin, now his warm aad devoted supporter,
published â¢ that . Mr. Welle had learned on the
preceding day that his friend, Mr. Flint, had
not been placed upon the Supervisorial ticket;
that In the evening he had sent. for Mr. Max
Goldberg (who Is Max Goldberg?) . and In
formed him that unless a place was made on
the ticket for Mr. Flint, he. Wells, would with
draw from the contestâ his emphatic words be
ing: "Mr. Flint goes on or I go off." Mr.
Goldberg,' the Bulletin continues, at once tele
phoned to Mr. Herrln,' and then started for the
latter's house. The next morning â¢ Mr. Gold
berg and Chairman Riordan met at Mr. Wells'
office, and there Mr. \ Wells reiterated that un
less Mr. Flint was at once put on he . would
withdraw for good. Shortly after this inter
view Mr. Wells, so the Bulletin's ' story con
tinues, , informed the Bulletin representative
that the leaders of the party agreed with' the
position he had taken, and Mr." Herrin so ex
pressed himself, and that if the change was
not made he should; certainlyâ I quote his own
words :. as reported in : the Bulletin * verbatimâ
"retire; not only frqm ,the contest but from
politics for all time to come." kfl
Gentlemen, one-half â¢ of ' that prediction has
proved' untrue. Mr. Wells has not retired from
the contest." It remains for you to determine
whether he shall prove a good prophet as ' to
the oLher â¢ halfâ whether \u25a0 you will give hlm'on
election day leave to retire from, politics . for
all time to come. .-â¢ ' V .
Thlo "Single episode, /I submit to your
candid Judgment, Is In . itself sufficient
to denote . the man. Through It his true
weak, vacfllating-and subservient character is
seen as through a glass. It fully justifies the
judgment pronounced upon him by . the r Chron
icle of October 23, . when it ; said: ; "He may
wince, he may flounce, but in the end he obeys
orders.". ' ;*:./- \u25a0 . - ' '
You remember the. words of that
other t elderly gentleman upon that occasion:
"If I' be. not ashamed of my army, I am a
soused curnet." . . - \u25a0
But: of Mr. Wells : himself , what manner of
man. is he? What are his qualifications" to oc
cupy the responsible position to which he
aspires? I think that hia true character is de
noted by one single episode of his life, ' which
lately took place. . . â¢- .,-..-.
"Well, as to my record, that is for you
to judge," replied the modest Sheriff.

ence.- - - * - , \u25a0- ;-;
It has been charged in. some quarters that
the family of which Mr. Tobin is a
member fill important positions and exercise
a commanding Influence in the management of
the affairs of .that bank. Let me ask of those
who make '- such an accusation, why, In the
name of Justice and common sense, should they
not? Have they not been connected- with that
institution from Its Infancy? Have they not
watched over its cradle? Have they not seen
it by gradual and honest expansion grow up
to Its present commanding height?^ Have they
not for nearly half a century successfully
steered its bark through all storms without
disaster. Without , wreck, . even without panic?
What dictate, then, of business, of prudence or
of Justice should require that they abandon a
trust which they have for so many years filled
with such unswerving fidelity, such command
ing intelligence â¢ and such - unvarying success?
But it . has been said by others that Mr.
Tobin Is too young to be a, Mayor of this city.
Depositors In 'the Hibernia Bank, of which a
large; number '. are now undoubtedly before
me. is he deemed too young to stand guard and
protect your Interests? Has he been proved un
worthy of that- trust? And If worthy of that
by what token do you decide that he Js too
young. to occupy the public position to which he
aspirec? He is, on , the contrary; in the very
prime . of manhood. â¢ At bis age Napoleon xhm
Allow me to dwell for a moment upon that
point. Do you all realize what the Hibernia
Bank Is? Do you all appreciate its magni
tude? It is essentially a bank of the people.'
It is the keeper of the money of persons of
modest means and meager iflcbme; 78,000 de
positors appear upon Its rolls; $60, 000, 000 â¢ con
stitute its deposits. It 13 a power in the land
and has been - so front a time coeval
almost with the existence of- the State
Itself. It â¢ Is a -power, besides, which . has
always been exercised on the side of right. Jus
tice and good government. It is a power which,
during the panic of 1S93, was strong enough
with its vast resources and prudent foresight
to save the city from the most direful finan
cial disaster that had ever threatened to en
gulf its prosperity. To be connected with such
an institution as Mr. Tobin is Is in itself a
liberal education. To be connected with, such
an Institution is In Itself, a guaranty of faith
ful public service. To be connected with
such an institution Is in itself a pledge of
loftiness of character and fitness for public
service.
He has already served the public
\u25a0with credit to himself and honor, to
the city. He is one of that Board of
Supervisors whose record Republi
can journals proclaim to be without
stain. ITor is he otherwise wanting in
the management of affairs. He has
been for years connected with one of
the largest financial institutions, not
only of this city, but of the world.
He is now the chief counsel of that
great repository of the people's
moneyâ the Hibernia Bank.
Ani now having contrasted the nominees of
the Board of Supervisors, let me contrast the
nominees who stand at the head of the ticket.
My opinion of "Mr. -Wells I have already suffi
ciently Indicated. Who, then, is Mr. Tobin?,
You all know. A young man born in this city
33 years ago," educated here, practicing among
you an honorable profession, married and hav
ing his home in your midst.
It is gratifying to note that the election of
this ticket seems to be conceded on all hands
as â¢ a f oreffone conclusion. Why this conces
sion? Clearly because . party spirit is not suf
ficient to overcome public spirit. Clearly be
cause partisan politics are not "sufficient to
blind the eyes of honest Republicans to thÂ»
corrupt origin of their own party ticket, the
unworthy character of \ the ' materials compos
ing It nor the destructive consequences which
would attend its election.

1 1 have read its annals awry, if . such has
not been - the history of the Board of Super
.visors of this city for the eighteen or twenty
years preceding the charter, .. I speak, therefore -
of that which you all do know when I say that
at no time during that period would any party,
Democrat or Republican,* have daredâ no party
in fact did dare â to renominate a Board of Su
pervisors after Its term had- expired. The pub
lic invariably heaved a sigh of relief at -the
disappearance of the old board and generally
with fatal >: fatuity . straighway . proceeded to
bend- their necks to : a yoke which, * though
wreathed with garlands of flowers, was no less
galling than before. \u25a0-,
It is a fact, therefore, - calculated . to arrest
attention that, . for the first < time in the his
tory of the city a party \u25a0 has ventured . to re
nominae its old Board of Supervisors. -Why?
The reason is given in the words of the Repub
lican paper which I have already quoted: ''No
scandal stains the record of their service." They
have discharged their duties - faithfully. They
have - served the people ; according to the dic
tates of their conscience. They have acted in
accordance with the "great' principles- of the
Democracy to which they belong. :Have you
heard that during their term public franchise*
had - been given â¢ away to favorites ? \u25a0 Ha ve you
heard that great corporations \u25a0 have -been al
lowed to shirk the burdens of taxation? Have
you ! heard that they had yielded to -the cor
rupt wiles of - the emissaries â¢ of ;. the money

to' stand up 'in behalf- of the j rights
of -the people against corporation blandish

Let me begin with examining the personnel
of the Board of Supervisors which your party
presents lor the public approval. In, an edi
torial of the 23d of this month The Call. "after
dwelling at length upon the fact that the
Republicans had received their nominations at
the hands of certain bosses and political ma
nipulators, proceeded to say:
â¢'The men named by the Democratic party for
Supervisors are men whom the stanchest . Re
publican can vote for without any sacrifice of
party loyalty or any lack of civic patriotism.
No scandal stains the record of their service.".
Permit me briefly to lay that record before you
and' to rehearse in a few words the public.his
tory of that board, j Before doing so, however,
permit me. to dwell upon the. fact -that a ma
jority of that board have been renominated and
constitute -the majority of the . nominees upon
the present Democratic ticket. This renomina
tion of "a former board constitutes a new de
parture In | the political annals â¢ of San Fran
cisco. I cast no slander upon this city when 1
say - that never before within the , memory of
living men has any party here denominated a
Board of Supervisors Rafter its term had ex
pired. Such bodies . had generally become no
toriously so corrupt â¢ that , their renomination
would have invited derision and insured defeat.
My recollection goes back to eighteen or twen
ty . years before the present charter. During
that period this city had invariably been -. In
flicted with boards which : In the end never
failed to forfeit the confidence of the people.
Under the old regime had not the Solid Nine
become one of the chronic cancers of the body
politic? Was not every public sheet filled week
after week and month after month with de
nunciation of their methods? Was not the pub
lic mind kept in constant alarm with'apprehen
sions of their schemes of favoritism of corrupt
practices and of .public plunder? Was it not
notorious that they were \u25a0 manipulated at will
by the vile stipendiaries of plundering corpora
tions, and that . in return for . favors granted or
bribes received they 'stripped .the" city, of fran
chises -of incalculable .value, basely, connived
at evasions of taxation, and, In the Interest of
private prof.t, unjustly refused to lighten pub
lic burdens ? . \u25a0 - - .. . " .
To you now. my Democratic friends, I speak.
You have reason to be proud of the contrast
which your ticket presents to that which I
have just \u25a0 dealt with.' You -have '.'reason to
exult over the praise which your political ad
versaries of old have bestowed upon the work
of your convention and the character of ; its
nominees. -. \u25a0\u25a0

EXCELLENT .CHARACTER
OF OPPOSING TICKET
Continued From Page. One.
.The new names which have been placed upon
our Supervisorial ticket are not all familiar to
me. If,' however, I am to Judge of them In
the mass by those that I do know, I cannot but
believe that they are not unworthy to be writ
ten side by side with those of the old mem
bers. Take, for ' instance, \u25a0 Henry Payot. The
whole community knows him as a' merchant
long established hereâ a gentleman of spotless
reputation, whose name is accepted everywhere
as the synonym of legitimate enterprise, integ
rity and fair dealing; whose reputation is that
of a man of broad capacity ror affairs,' exten
sive Information and liberal and enlightened
views. Take next John Landers. Every man
in San Francisco knows Colonel Landers. He
has been for more than a quarter of a century
one of the most efficient and most honored of
the insurance men of this city. ' Having for
years had great trusts confided to his bands he
has successfully carried on the varied affairs
of one of the largest assurance companies of
this city. No one who has ever met him, either
socially or In business, but would gladly
bear witness, to his" fairness and his liberality,
to. the generosity of his impulses- and. to the
kindness of his heart. ,Payot and Landers are
men whose hair is already sllvared. with age.
But' take a representative of more recent' birth.'
Take; for Instance, my . young friend, Knox
Maddox, who returned but a year ago covered
with honors from the halls of that venerable
university which Is this very week celebrating
its bi-centennlal. Born in the county which
has been my home for so . many years," and
from parents who were associates of my early
life, in him and his career I may be pardoned
for taking "an especial interest. I , am glad
to see him* so soon entering a public career. I
am proud to behold him enlisted In this, his
first campaign, under a banner uplifted in the
cause of good government. ,1 am beyond meas
ure delighted to contemplate mm thus early
following in the honored footsteps of his father
and grandfather, both of whom successively
representedâ ably and honestly representedâ the
county of Santa Clara in the Senate ' of this
State.- Far, Indeed, would the State have to go
to find worthier and abler representatives of
her cause than these. And, therefore, Judging
of the others with whom I hold slighter ac
quaintance, I take leave to repeat that these
names are a sufficient guarantee of the general
excellency of the rest.

the service. They have, while keeping within
the' dollar limit, saved $655,000 for streets,
sewers, public improvements and schoolhouses.
They have saved and economized $320,000 to pay
school teachers and .creditors of the city for
old indebtedness. In fine, as If to place a
final and worthy crown upon their services,
they have reduced the car fare to 2>4 cents for
school children, enabling the offspring of the
poorest among you to avail themselves at the
smallest possible cost of all the advantages of
your admirable Public School Department. \u25a0
May I not say, then, with prophetic confi
dence that as it is the first time In the his
tory of the city that a Board of Supervisors
has been renominaed. so it will be the \u25a0 first
time that a board will be re-elected.
does it happen that such un
desirable nominations were made? Is
it because there are no good men in the
Republican party, no men competent
to fill these or any other public sta
tions? The fact seemsâ indeed, it ia
conceded â to be thai the convention
which placed . these men in noimina
tionwas composed of mere dummies;
that their work was cut and dried be
forehand, and that they merely went
through the idle ceremony and empty
farce of ratifying a choice not of their
own choosing and placing before the
people nominees not . of \u25a0â their own
selection'. This : charge has been so
often and so openly; made, j it is so
fully substantiated by ;the character
of the nominees, that it would be'do

it to be true. \u25a0;';\u25a0; 1' V ;./-;'

the stand and repeated his speech. There

his age Alexander Hamilton had already filled
the highest public station in the administration
of Washington. At his age William- Pitt had
already been for ten years Prime Minister of
England. At hia age Alexander had already
conquered the world. What folly, then, is It to
make of his youth a crime or a bar to his le
gitimate ambition to serve the public.
But if by training and by business associations
of himself and his family for many years the in
terests of Mr. Tobin are inseparably interwoven
with those of the great mass of the population
of this city, so is he by birth and origin. He
comes of that great stock from which many
of the most illustrious soldiers, .enlightened
statesmen, brilliant orators and renowned finan
ciers have descendedâ the stock of the plain
yeomanry of Ireland. ' Of that origin he is
Justly proud. His words spoken la one of the
public halls of this city yesterday evening
should ring In the ears of all those who have
undertaken to be hia detractors. He then said:
'The people I am proud to call my own com
menced their life in this land in as humble
circumstances as any man in this hall. By
their efforts they have risen to a condition of
comparative wealth. Their prosperity I have
shared. But. gentlemen. I have never forgot

detail the principles embodied In the platform
to whose support Mr. Tobin and his fellow
nominees are pledged. Let me take one single
illustration: I refer to the Geary-street fran
chise. The acquisition of this franchise will
be the flm step in the great work of acquir
ing the public, utilities of this city, which is
destined to purify and revolutionize it3 whole
government. What says the platform upon
that subject? It says: "We pledge our nomi

to propose necessary extensions, in order^ t-Â»

. And now there is a third class of voters -whoso
attention I would enlist for a few moments,
and to whom T would address with an espe
cial appeal a few words:.
tVorkingmen of San Francisco, where in this
contest do you purpose to stand? Putting the.
question In different form, where do your true
Interests lie? >a^~*
A convention composed of delegates from
some of your unionaâ Dy no. means allâhas nom
inated and placed in the field a municipal
ticket purposely composed of men selected ex
clusively from your own ranks, and pledged
to support your own especial interests. - This
ticket makes an especial appeal for your sup
port. Of the names which compose It I have
no knowledge which would Justify me to speak
otherwise than in terms of entire respect.
That from among th* ranks of labor^candi
dates can be selected who in point of charac
ter, integrity, and devotion to principle need
fear no comparison with any equal ' party of
men selected by any political party or organi
zation I fully believe and do not hesitate to
proclaim. That srich a selection has been made
in the present case it would not aid my argu
ment to deny. Yet I cannot give that ticket
my. support. Sympathizing fully with the ef
forts of all who labor and are heavy laden, in
full accord with the grand and noble move
ment which is now going on over the face of
the whole civilized globe to uplift into the
light and sunshine of a happier condition the

a follower of Jefferson, holding with unswerv
ing devotion to the faith proclaimed by him
that all men are created equal and that govern
ments should protect the equal rights of alt
and confer special privileges upon none, believ
ing that the political equality which
has rewarded the struggles of the
century which has Just expired is
destined to be crowned In tho century now Just
born by corresponding economic equality, look
ing upon labor as the true source of all life;
the foundation of all wealth and the condition
of all civilization. I yet do not hesitate to
i proclaim that this effort cannot but fail to
advance the laboring classes toward the (foal
for which they are striving. "Why I hold these
views. It may be proper for you to ask, and
it is Jostle* to myself that I should answer.
When upon the field of Gettysburg. Abraham
Lincoln uttered the ever memorable sentiment
that this nation was- dedicated to the proposi

the people, by the people and for the people
to perish, from the earth, he pronounced the
most memorable condemnation of all class gov

Enlightened by his teaching and inspired bJ
his lofty sentiments. . you. the worklngmen ( J
San Francisco, and your fellow laborers 17

justly condemned a government by the money
class for the benefit of the money power. â¢< For
the selfsame reason that I agree with you In
that condemnation I must disagree with you
when you yourselves seek to establish a govern
ment by your own clas3 for the benefit of your
own class. The - wrong in one case is no â¢ less
than - In the other. The principle which con-

o'clock Captain Lemly read a written ' state

dispatches referred to by Admiral Schley in
his morning testimony. The dispatches re
ferred to coaling and In one case the name
"Gonaives" was used, . when It appeared the
name "Guantanamo" should have been given.
Then Admiral Schley, at the request of Ray
nor, stated his observation of suspicious cir
cumstances o ( n land and In wie harbor of San
tiago on the evening of July 2." He said that
the outlying Spanish land forces/ were at that
time being pressed Into the city' by the Amer
ican and insurgent forces, and he. had noticed
Ahat several of. their blockhouses burned that
evening. He had.ut the same time observed
smoke- coming from over Zocapa hill and hÂ«
thought the enemy. was preparing for a sortie.
Of mis circumstance he had notified Admiral
Sampson and he thought the admiral had, acted
upon the notice as the blockading line was
moved in closed that night. He explained why
all the engines of the Brooklyn hadnot been
coupled up. saying this was largely because of
the intense heat and also because Captain Cook
"had not considered it necessary to do so.

The Judge advocate then exhibited "the Â«og of
the Vixen and asked the witness to examine
it and determine whether there was any entry
then: to indicate that the vessel had performed
this service. He said there was one entry
â¢which showed that on July 2 there was a dis
tribution of mail by the Vixen and this, he
Eaid. showed that the had made a trip up and
down the line.

â¢ "Early in the evening." he replied. "I should
say in the first dog-watch." He added in re
ply ix) a question that he had kept a diary of
the -rarnpaign, but paid it is in Bonton. Cap
tain Lemly asked him to get It and he prom
ised to do so. In response to Raynor the wit
ness eaid that the Vixen was constantly going
on eirands and that record was made of com
. riarmively few of these in the boat's log.
r Captain Clark was also recalled for the pur
f/^se of correcting his previous statements, but
, tjo questions were asked him and he was soon
\u25a0 excused.
Schley Besumes Testimony.
Admiral Schley then took the stand and re
sumed his story. With the court's permission
he eaid he would go back to Cienfuegos in order
that his narrative might be clear. Regarding
the ItcCal'.a memorandum he said he received
but one copy. If there had been another, he
said, it should be in the papers which- were re
turned to the Navy Department 111 January or
February, 1S00. He said he had not bombarded
the earthworks at Cienfuegoe because he was
convinced that such bombardment would be un
availing. Subsequent experience in the war, he
thought, bore out this opinion.
Admircl Schley was proceeding to say that
dispatch No. 10, concerning which Lieutenant
Mars-! had testified (tbe dispatch containing
positive information that the Spanish fleet waÂ«
in Santiago), was not received by him until
June 10, when ths judge advocate objected.
Caftain Lemly â If the court please, I regret
very much to be compelled to .make objection
to th.s character of testimony, but I understand I
from the court itself that it wants factB. 1
Admiral Schley (sotto voce)â Well, these are j
tarts I ,
Captain Lemly â I do not understand thte -wit
ness is here for the purpose of making argu
ment, and I do not th^nk this character of t*s
tlmory from a witness even on the stand in
his own behalf is a matter of testimony.
Raynor contended that Admiral SchlÂ«y *aa
not giving opinions; that he wai simply testl--
./Ving to facts within his knowledge.
;jl A.ft*r some further sparring the members of
u \** court held a brief consultation without
teavtng the courtroom and Admiral - Dewey
announced its decision as follows:
"The court le of the opinion that It is Â«nl
ftently proper for the witness to make the j
"Were you present or do you know that such
message was delivered to the commander in
chief, and if eo by whom delivered T'
"I have no recollection of its having been
delivered to the commander in chief."
Captain Lemlyâ Were you personally present
and within hearing when this megaphone mes
sage was received by the Vixen?
"It If a matter entirely of recollection, and a
gooc recollection â I was."
"To the bept of my recollection the Vixen re
ceievd by megaphone from an officer on the
quarterdeck of the Brooklyn on the night of
July 2 such message as that, and to tbe best of
my belief did. as she usually did, carry such
message to the flagship and to other vessels
of t^e squadron."
'T'id the Vixen carry a verbal report from
Commodore Rchley to the commander In chief
July 2 that there was unusual activity shown
by the enemy in the harbor?"
Previous to Admiral Schley's appearance on
the i?tand the witnesEses of yesterday were re
called for the purpose of correcting their tes
timony. The first of these witnesses thus
called -was Lieutenant Commander Harlow, of
whom the court asked a question concerning the
activity in the harbor at Santiago on the even
ing of July 2. The r.epjy to this question had
the effect of causing 'Jtidge Advocate Lemly to
entev upon a line of questions. The court's
qufMion was as follows:
Â©f inquiry to-<2ay Admiral Schley continued the
recilal of his narrative regarding his conduct
in the Spanish war. When the court adjourned
yesterday he had covered most cf the points of
the campaicrn previous to the beginning of the
Santiago blockade, leaving that blockade, the
recoanoiFsance of May 21, the battle off San
tiago and the famous loop of the Brooklyn yet
to rÂ« told of. The admiral, notwithstanding
the strain of yesterday, appeared fresh and in
good condition for the worjc nerore him to-day.
Admiral Dewey rapped for order promptly at
31 o clock. The ceurtroom was crowded as it
never has been before. Persons without tickets
erri'ing after 10 o'clock were eitherVompelled to
accept standing room in the rear of the hall or to
leavo the building without hearing the proceed
ings, as many of them did. As was the case
5eFti>rday. Admiral Schley was thoroughly self
pofS'jssed and he again spoke clearly and dis
tinctly, so that his words were heard through
out the hall.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â In the Schley court
OPERATIONS OFF SANTIAGO.
Kelired Hear Admiral Explains tbe
Movements of the Squadron.
This brought Admiral Schley to the: time of
the arrival of Admiral Sampson, commander
Admiral Schley also took- occasion to- speak
of the instructions . to him to examine Guanta
namo as a coalins base. To do this was he
said not practicable, as at ileast 1000 marines
would have been necessary to guard that point
and these could. not be spared. . .
"If we had gone there we should have In
vited attack."- he said. "These." he added.
"were amotic the matters I had to consider."
Again leaving the question of the reconnois
sance, the witness related the particulars of
the arrival of the New Orleans on May 30
with Captain Folger in command, and convoy
ing the collier Sterling. Captain Folger had.
the admiral said, brought instructions -to sink
the collier in the channel at Santiago, ; the de
tails to be left to Admiral Schley's discretion.
"I did not understand that this passage was
to be blockaded except in -case we should be
compelled to abandon the port, in which event
that expedient was to be resorted to." \ - ..
He then proceeded. to detail his conversation
with Captain Folger concerning which Captain
Folgrr also testified as a witness for the de
partment. While satisfied that Captain Foleer
had not meant to do any injustice to him (the
witness) he felt that the captain had failed to
give all the details of the conversation. '
"He did not want to explain to this court
just what the conversation had been, for I
had condemned the circular formation of block
ade and had advocated the form which I had
established as. beinsr more- mobile and more
facile for a small fleet, such as ours was. In
case of attack by the enemy, as more \u25a0 easily
manipulated and handled under signal. \u25a0â¢\u25a0 The
captalij spoke of advising: me to : keep in
closer, ' continued Admiral Schley, "whereas
on thrj next day he signaled that the enemy
would fire on us at the then range. We had
not changed our position."
After this digression the admiral returned to
the reconnoissance of May 31. That some of
the younger officers who testified regarding that
occurrence were mistaken, he said, was proved
by the fact that there was to-day on the deck
of the Indiana a plate showing where an 8
ln'ch shell from the land fortifications entered
June '4 and wrecked her, wardroom. The offi
cers referred to had testified that there v/ere
no guns of ever 6-inch caliber in the Santiago
land batteries. The admiral said the shell
which wrecked the wardroom of the Indiana
might possibly have been fired from a mor
tar, of which there were several, but that the
range of the ' batteries was beyond the ships
as they went \u25a0 in for the reconnoissance was
evident,' not from the fact that there were one
or two shells which went over the American
ships. There were, he said, many more, per
haps fifty.
"In fact." said he. "it was very lively for a
few minutes." â¢ â¢ ,. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
The witness stated that he had not gone Into
foreign waters for coal because he wanted to
avoid international complications and espe
cially wanted to avoid the charge of taking
advantage of weaker nations like Hayti ami
others. '
Avoided International Trouble.
better use, and subsequent events confirmed the
decision."
Here the witness abruptly turned from the
bombardment of the Colon to a discussion of
the coaling question. He said that his Instruc
tions had been to coal on every possible occa
sion. He then quoted and put in as evidence a
number of dispatches giving the Instructions
of the department on this question. He re
lated in this connection the receipt of a num
ber of dispatches from the department which
had. he said, been brought by Captain Cot
ton. He was sure that the dispatches could
not have been received before May 31.
When he received these dispatches the ad
miral, in answer to questions by Raynor, tes
tified that he had already discovered the Span
ish fleet. He had also surmounted the difficul
ties about coaling and had bo informed the
department. In this connection he went back
and narrated the (incident of the capture by
the St Paul of th4 Restormel. the English col
lier bound for Santiago. Captain Slgsbee had
reported that the collier had been captured
May 26 d*tr Santiago. Sigsbee's letter mention
ed the fact that the Kcstormcl had touched
at Porto Rico and Curacao and that he had
sent her to Key AVest, adding: "There is
absolutely no news of the Spanish fleet here."
On the 31st he received, he thought, by way
of a press tug from Port Antonio, the dispatch
of Admiral Sampson congratulating him upon
the location of the Spanish fleet. In reply to
a question by his counsel. Admiral Schley ex
plained that Cape Cruz was an exposed place
103 miles from Santiago and he did not regard it
as an available place for coaling. Some of
the smaller ships might have been sent there,
but with a squadron such as he had, practi
cally of the same size as the Spanish fleet, he
had never considered the question of separating
ships of his fleet. He regarded It as of prime
Importance that the 'fleet be kept together.
His attention was called to Lieutenant Har
ber's testimony likening the situation south
of Cuba with that at Dry Tortugas. where
ships . had coaled. The admiral said that the
two places were not comparable. The sea to
the south of Cuba was exposed for hundreds
of miles. Dry Tortugas was surrounded by
reefs In which a. sea could rarely enter. From
information he received from Captain Cot
ton he thought he received the impression that
only small ships could be coaled at Mole St.
Nicholas or Gonaives channel.
."'Close action or close up has been hoisted
and it means to keep- Inside of a thousand
yards, out of their effective torpedo range.'
Captain â¢ Cook was standing alongside me and
said: 'Yes, we will soon be -within the cross
fire of these ships.' I said: 'Yes,' and that I
saw we had advanced without firing. The
first gun, I think, was , fired, by Lieutenant
Simpson, almost directly over the forecastle of
the ship. I saw the leading ship, which ap
parently had started with, the intention of ram
ming, take a turn ahead to the westward, leav
ing a gap between her and the ship following,
which subsequently proved to be the Viscaya.
We were advancing In the direction of the Vls
caya, when she also seemed to have given up
the intention to ram, and turned to the west
ward following the direction, of the leading
ship.' \ .- â¢ \
Vlt then became apparent, as we were steer
ing In diametrically opposite courses, that
the original plan had failed, and that the
Spanish fleet, in order and apparently at dis
tance,, had succeeded in passing the battleship
line. : A new feature of the fight .became im
mediately apparent. Captain Cook gave the
order to port helm. . I did not. I should have
done it"' in a second.'. I saw.. the ship's head
swinging ~ very' rapidly, and I asked him
whether . his helm was hard aport, and he
replied that It was either aport or hard aport.
I think he said hard aport. I never saw the
ship turn -more' rapidly than, she did at this
time. Her turn | was : continuous. There was
no easing: of her helm. I never, saw the star
board side of the Texas at all. We were never
across her bow. I never was at her port side,
and she never, approached any 1 position", that
was within six hundred \u25a0 yards of the Brook
lyn. -She never entered into my head at all as
a menace , or - danger. .We passed completely
around the circle. The least range that was
given was>1100 yards and the fact of the near
ness of that ship (the second Spanish ship),im
pressed Itself upon my mind and will never be
forgotten, because . I could see vwlth I the . naked
eye men .running over her turrets to her su
perstructure deck, and I observed the daylight
between their* leys as they ran. .". ... \u25a0...-,
. "We turned very rapidly, and I had been for
a long time under the impression that our star
board engine was backed, from the fact that
I was standing. upon the starboard and in look
ing astern I saw an unusual amount of churned
water. It looked to me very; much as if the en
gine had been backing. Though the matter was
not -one of record; I found out subsequently, I
had always been under the Impression that that
engine had backed." During the turn Mr. Hodg
son i very properly: made some allusion to look
out, perhaps, for the Texas. - I do not recall
what It I Is, but there was never any colloquy
of any character, between Mr. Hodgson and my
self. First, he was too good an officer to have
transgressed one of , the \u25a0 plainest â¢ duties of - an
officer at such.- a. time, and, second, if he had

"TJhe Brooklyn as well as the other vessels of
the squadron charged Immediately Into the en
trance In accordance with the signal plan of
seeking the enemy's ships in the entrance or
driving them ashore. We continued directly
for the head of the enemy's column, the idea
uppermost In my mind being that if we could
arriMit them long enough for the battleships to
close in and knock them to pieces that would
be our best point of attack. They continued on
this course, porting and starboarding to meet
the movements of the leading ship, which I
assumed to be the flagship from a flag at her
masthead. I suppose from the time we started
we were ten to twelve minutes turning first
with port helm and then advancing direct to
the enemy. 1 saw the- ships to the eastward
and westward closing in. I said to Captain
Cook:- -,-..*

Is that the ship's head was near north-north
west. The Texas appeared to me. to be head
ing on some of the easterly To the
left of her was the Iowa. She was, of course,
to the eastward of the Texas. The Oregon was
to the eastward of the Iowa. The Indiana
was eastward of that position and the Glou
cester was lying in under the land, I thought
In the neighborhood of Aguadores. The Ne,w
York was out of sight and out of signal dlb
tance with glasses. I looked at that in order
to determine what my position in the battle
was to be. If the New York had not been
out of sight I should never have made a
signal.
"The moment I saw that I went forward onto
a little* platform I had constructed on the
battle tower as my position in the battle, in"
order to be very close to Captain Cook. I had
only been there a moment when Captain Cook
Joined me. ... In the meantime Mr. Hodgson,
who was on the upper bridge, sang out some
thing to the captain about being connected up
and all ready, and he at the same time said
to -me:' 'Commodore, they are coming right
at us.' - 'Well,' I said, 'go right for them."
The helm was put aport. The ship was started
ahead, first at perhaps about half speed; I
do not remember. She ' took her way very
quickly and when we headed around' I said to
Captain Cock: 'Go ahead full -speed and
hoist signal to clear ship for action." We gen
erally ipade 'that signal because there was
around the quarter deck and the forecastle of
most of these ships a little temporary railing
composed of oars and rope, to keep people
from falling overboard. Generally an awning
of some sort was up. That signal was followed
by: 'Close up for close action.'

speaking of this event and the change In com
mand which it i involved, he ventured upon
ground which Captain. Lemly considered as
somewhat questionable." Coming to this point
the witness said:
"On June. 1 Admiral Sampson arrived. He
brought with him the New York, the Oregon
and the Mayflower and steamed down to the
westward a little inside of the lino of block
ade. He found us at, that time Just making
the turn and I, was on board. He was very
cordial, very glad to /see me and I explained
to him the situation and the fact of the re
connoissance. He seemed to be very glad to
find out the situation there and I pointed out
â¢to him the Colon lying In the entrance."
Captain Lemly â If the court please,- we are
getting beyond the court's construction of the
scope of the precept. , * . '
Admiral Deweyâ As I understand, he is turn
ing thetfommand over to the commander in

hear that part.
Continuing Admiral Schley said: "I handed
him a number of dispatches, explained to him
the situation and told him the form of block
ade 1 that I had maintained and I. heard no
word of complaint from him. In fact. In view
of the telegram of congratulation, I supposed
nearly everything was approved. Admiral
Sampson's relations and mine were always cor

Admiral Dewey â You have ! turned the com
mand over.. Now go on: '. . . .
"I turned the command ,over to Admiral
Sampson and my squadron was not -broken
up until the 18th or 19th of June. I was -still
in command of the flying squadron and com

what its operations were up to that time."

those vessels, and knowing exactly their
heights, reported to me that they were main
taining the same range, but I thought my eye
was a little more sensitive, and I said: 'No,
they are evidently gaining.' He went from
me the second time, and that was the last I
saw of him alive. In performing this magnifi
cent duty he lost his life. He' was struck
about ten feet from where I was standing.
His brains and blood were ' thrown over a
great many people, and some of It reached
me. He , Immediately fell, of course, to the
deck, and it was a shocking sight to men who
had never seen such a thing before.
"Lieutenant McCauley and Dr. Devalin got

of her " hatches. I thought she was
goinc to ' carsize. she had such a
tremendous list to port. Just - then I
saw a- shell strike her that appeared to
me to rake her fore and aft, and I thought to
myself she would sink in deep water, so I told
the signal officer to signal to the Texas to look
out for her men and to save them, but the
Texas was too far astern to~receive the mes
sage. -I made the remark a.t the time, how
ever, 'Philip Is always sensible. He needs no
Instructions about such things.' . .
"During this part of the fight I noticed that
all of the signal halyards of my ship were cut,
I think possibly with one exception. One of the
speed cones we had hoisted was cut and came
very near striking me. It came down in front
of me and went overboard.
-.'After the Vlscaya had turned In afire, her
colors down, the Colon edged in shore and ap
peared to be following the contour of the
coast and I thought that at that time, look
ing Â»aÂ«tern and : observing what had happened
to her consorts, she was seeking the best
place she could find in order to end the matter
at once. From Acerrederos, which was behind
some sixteen miles west of the harbor of San

about thirty miles, so I said to Captain Cook
'cease firing' and, to make the signal. I also
told Captain Cook to let his men come out of
the turrets into the open . air and get' some
thing to eat and hurry Jip his men , below. I
think I went into the battle tower myself at
that time and sang out to the men below that
we had got all of them except one - and I
thought they could be depended upon to catch
that other vessel. I heard a good . deal of
merriment and rejoicing.- I went back to the
bridge and soon realized that they* were doing
their best. There wig a Jingle to the rails
and a vibration to th^-.essel, and I percefved
that the motion of thj ship was sluggish. I
tuggested to Captain Cook that we possibly
had some compartments filled. - He sent' the
carpenter down and . it developed that on*> of
the after compartments had filled with water
which ' we . thought was due to the , fact that
we had received some injury below he water
line. -
"These two ships, the Oregon and the Brook
lyn were firing in a manner I had never seen
before. I nevir realized what rapid gun fire
meant. Both ships were at that time a sheet
of flame. Soon after that I saw that the lead
ins ship was evidently battered hard. She lag
ged astern. I saw smoke coming out other
ports, and out of her hatches, and the fact that
impressed itself upon me was that the columns
were going straight up in the air. I said to
Captain Cook, who was constantly at my side.

position on the bow and I thought for a little
while that she would perhaps outfoot us. The
Colon worked inshore, and the time \u25a0between
the dropping out of action of those two ships
until the Viscaya turned inshore was a period
of perhaps thirty minutes during which .she
was abreast of the Brooklyn and the Oregon.
I looked to the eastward and got occasional
glimpses of the Indiana and of the Gloucester.
I could not see very well what they were do
ing owing to the clouds of smoke, though I
knew that both were doing admirable work. I
felt that the moment those vessels ran in to
the beach the" commanding officers of the
ships which could not keep up the pace with
the two leaders would take care of the pris

"About thirty minutes, as nearly as I can
remember, was the length of time from the

vessels until the (Viscaya went ashore. She
was a little forward of the beam of the Brook

or 2400 yards away She was in most excellent
target range and I remember that a marina
stationed in the top reported that he did not
see any of the shots of the two ships, the
Brooklyn and the Oregon, hitting the water.
So I imagined from that that they were strik

the turn. I was very anxious about the ranges,

Mr. Raynorâ My wishes are that If you
can summon him, summon him. As I
understand it, Admiral Sampson Is not in
a condition to be summoned. He is not
well enough to come into court. I am
perfectly willing to have him here and I.
"Before the court adjourns I would like
to ask counsel a question. He announced
publicly that he desired a summons
issued for Admiral Sampson. 1 have
stated from time to time that if he would
give me notice when he wanted the ad

have not received any notice and I do
not want to leave the record in this shape,

are in the matter."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.-Just
before the Schley court of
inquiry adjourned to-day
Ju3ge Advocate Lemly ad
dressed the court as follows:
"After having stated them to the commander
in chief a group of officers who were standing
on the opposite side came up to me and asked
meâ of course everybody was interestedâ for
the details ot this battle, and I repeated them
in a hasty way. Chaplain Royce of the New
York came up and said: 'Commodore, your
work is not over yet. The Resolute has Just
arrived. Captain Eaten reports that there 13
a Spanish battleship on the coast and the ad
miral wants to aee you.' I went over and there
found Captain Clark in the presence of the
commander in chief. I mart* some suggestion
"At 2:23 o'clock about, the Xew York came
up. I had made signals to her. I think she
was quite half an hour in answering one of
them. Of course there was net very much
breeze under the land. When she came up I
made the signal to her that it waa a glorious
day for our country, and as soon as I could I
went on board to pay my respects. In the
meantime Captain Cook, who had been de
tained some little time, started off to make
his report and went on board the flagship.
When he returned I took the boat and want
on board myself. There I reported substan
tially what had occurred, the Incidents and
events of the battle, in a hurried way. ' \u25a0
"I said to him: 'Unconditional. Those are
matters that the commander in chief must ar
range. We can only receive an unconditional
surrender.' ' .
"We arrived In the vicinity of the Colon
at 1:30. At the time she hauled her colors
down I did not think she was over four miles
from us. We were running then in the neigh
borhood of. fifteen knots. When this surrender
took place I naturally" felt Interested in the
vessels that were following. I waa then on
the bridge and with glasses I saw three ves
sels astern. I could see the masts of two. I
could see only the smoke of the third one.
We lowered the boat and Captain Cook wsnt
ashore. He said to me: "Commodore, -what
are the terms of surrender?*
"The position of the Colon being directly
under the fire of the two ships, there waa no
question In the mind of the captain of the
Colon that it would be fatal. I think he Oid
exactly right. A sacrifice of life would have
been unnecessary, so he fired a gun to the ice
ward and hauled his flag down and ran in on
the bar at the mouth of Rio Tarquino. I sig
naled at -once to cease firing, that the eneiuy
had surrendered. "We hauled up and imme
diately passed Into position. "We had sorrw
difficulty in getting out a boat, on account of
steam being turned oft and the cranks having
been struck. They were more or less jammed.

asking if we should slow up. I said, 'No, con

ment untli wa cculd get into smoother water,
where we could possibly handle it much more
readily. That course was decided upon. The
ship's speed, of course, came up with some
rapidity and toward 1- o'clock It was very
apparent that we were saining upon the
chase. I said to Captain Cook, several times
during the action, "Would It not be a good
idea to edge in so that we could finish tnose
fellows Quicker?' and he replied that we had
them in the most excellent target range ana
that the gruna of the two ships seemed to be
doing most admirable work. We were point
ing at that time for Tarquino Point, under
Cape Cruz, at the point extending to the
southward. My idea waa that in steering that
course if the Colon kept up her course aha
would be obliged to come out. I then said
I would get up a lot of extra ammunition ao
that when she came out into close quarters it
would be a question of but a few minutes be
fore we knocked her out. As we were going
out to head her off there were various signals
between the Oregon and mysjlf of a pleasing
character. Some were official. I gave the
order to Captain Clark to open fire with hi-Â»
13-inch runs. Captain Clark has testified that
be did not receive it, and I always had been
under the impression, until â¢! heard him say
otherwise, that that order had been trans
mitted. However, we continued to advance,
the Oregon and the Brooklyn. I don't think
the Oregon was further astern, than SOO yards.
I do not believe the prolongation of her courss
at any time would have passed within 500
yards of the Brooklyn. "We were practically
"and relatively at the same distances. Perhaps
the Brooklyn was a little nearer at times, and
then the Oregon a little nearer. -
"We continued in this position until about
12:50, when we realized that we were within
range of this vessel and we tried the thirtetu
inch and eight-Inch guns on her. Several of
them fell short, but I remember that one of
the Oregon's 13-inch shots passed entirely over
the Colon, and that one of the 8-inch shells of
the Brooklyn passed over her also. I saw with
. my own eyes the Jet ot water beyond. I
thought at first it had gone through her, but
it appears that it did not strike her.
"Now, you and I both know that Ad
miral Sampson is not in condition to bo
called into court. I do not want to bo
put in the position of abandoning my
position or of calling' Admiral Sampson
into a controversy where his presence is
not necessary, and when he is in no con
dition whatever to be brought into court,
even if his presence was necessary."
of course, don't retract for a moment
anything I said at the time when the call
was made. The court \u25a0will recollect the
use of the words *CIenfuesos' and 'San
tiago.' The word used .in that dispatch
was 'Santiago.' At the time Admiral
Schley sent the dispatch in to the Navy
Department there was in the paragrapn
'this evidently means Cienfuegos. W. Â£?.
S.' I took it for granted that that, of
course, would be admitted. There was
only one person in the world' who could
explain that, and that wa3 Admiral
Sampson. My learned brother declined to
admit it. I do not think now the question
is as serious as I did at that time.
Explaining the historical turn of his
own flagship, the Brooklyn, he said that
she had not aprpoached to within less
than 6pO yards of the Texas, and that he
never had considered his vessel in the
leas't danger;
He also stated, in response to an inter
rogation from Raynor, that he had never,
during the battle, engaged In any colloquy
witli Lieutenant Hodgson, and that he
.had not used the exrpession attributed,
to aim by Hodgson. This refers to \u25a0 the
alleged colloquy in which the admiral is
charged with having said: "Damn the
Texas."
Ailxnlral Schley also gave the details of
the reconnaisance of May 21, when ths
Spanish ship Cristobal Colon was bom
barded. In this connection he denied the
statements attributed to him by Com
mander Potts of the battleship Massa
chusetts.
Texas Not in Danger.
The day was a notable one in the court
By all oads the largest crowd that has yet
attended any of the sessions was present
and deep interest was manifested
throughout the proceedings. Long berore
the beginning cf the morning session all
the seats reserved for visitors in the
courtroom were occupied, and the greater
of the space in the rear of tnese seats
wan covered by men and women standing.
'x bey not only stood on the floor, but upon
wir-dow sills and tables, and even the
rude elevator machinery in that portion
of i-he hall was covered by men. On only
one occasion was there any effort at ap
plause, and this was suppressed before it
had reached any magnitude.
Tie chief event of the day was the ad
miral's relation cf the events of July 3,
when the American fleet destroyed Oer
veri's squadron. He told his story of this
historic occurrence in plain words and in
vma-ffected style, but the narrative was
straightforward and to the point, indl
cat:.ng close familiarity witn ail the
phases of that event. He said that the
Brooklyn had for a time sustained the
fire of all four of the Spanish ships, and
also the fire of the Spanish land batteries.
Great Crowd in Court.
This adjournment, twenty minutes in
advance of the usual time, was due to the
fact that the admiral's throat -had be
come somewhat sensitive as a result of
his continuous talking yesterday and to
day. He had made complaint to the court
of the condition of his throat immediately
aftÂ»r concluding his recital of the story
of the battle off Santiago, and Admiral
Dewey, who evidently himself had no
ticed the difficulty, responded by showing
a â¢HTillingness to adjourn the court. Mr.
Raynor, however, expressed a desire to
proceed, saying that he had a number of
Questions which he wished to ask, and
Admiral Schley assented to his counsel's
suggestion, a. quarter of an hour later
Acmiral Dewey nimself renewed the sug

Schley had not completed his
"The strength of the batteries having been
established it would have been military folly
to have risked the battleships further to fire
from these shore batteries under my instruc

or seven vessels the loss would have been a
very great disadvantage and It might. have In
vited attack with disastrous results. . I thought
it better policy to save the ships for wider and
"The moment we began firing," he went on,
"the Ehore batteries responded, some of them
using smokeless powder. There, was quite a
stream of projectiles, and I was impressed
with the Idea that they must be from guiTs of
six or eight inch caliber. <\u25a0 The shot from the
Zocapa battery evidently reached the fleet.
Some went over our ships and one went beyond
and over the Vixen, which was half a mile
distant.
Speaking of the range of 7000 yards the ad
miral said that Commander Potts had himself
suggested that range and he (the witness) had
not known for several days that the range had
been altered. \u25a0
"I think we were lying In a position per
haps four or five miles to.^b* westward. The
steaming in was at slow, speed. I transferred
my flag, named 7000 yards" and went on board
the Massachusetts. When I boarded her It
was near the dinner hour and Captain Hlggln
son suggested that we postpone until 1 o'clock
the going in to develop these batteries. 1 as
sented to that. After the meal we went to quar
ters and steamed in pretty .- nearly head on.
There was not much opportunity for anybody
to seek cover behind a turret unless he got
behind the protecting plate which was it guard
to the entrance to the rear. Some weight has
been laid upon the fact that we wore white
clothes. 1 would like to invite attention to
the fact that that was a matter which I con
trolled entirely for my squadron .' and it was
about the only suitable dress for that region."
Giving the names of the persons who accom
panied him when he went on ' board \u25a0 the Mas
sachusetts, the admiral said they were Lieu
tenants Sears, Wells and George Graham, a
newspaper correspondent, Â» who, he said, had
insisted upon accompanying him. notwith
standing his protests. Once on board he had,

I had some regard for those" standing on the

circumstanced, and I so expressed myself.
Commander Potts is entirely in error in say-

Reason for White Uniform.
"On the 31st. while the Brooklyn and the

I think one stated that the batteries were old
and another stated that Krupps were mounted.
The general ; belief, however, was that all of
the southern places were, very heavily forti
fied. In fact, we knew very little about the
effect of higher-powered artillery either on
shoriJ or -on board ship, and feeling that I
ought to know something about the fortifica
tions which defended that place I determined to
go in and take advantage of what I believed
to be the longest range of our guns and de
velop fully what these defenses were and In
cidf.ntally'lf we could get a shot into the Colon,
that was lyinjr exposed somewhat, to do it.
"That It was sufficient is shown by the fact
that during: its existence no vessel entered or
escaped from the harbor."
Coming to the, reconnoissance of May 31 Ad
miral Schley said: /
The next day he had discovered the pres
ence of that Spanish vessel there as he had
also that of other of the enemy's war vessels.
He said that when he had thus secured irre
futable proof of the fact that the vessels were
there and told Captain Sigsbee of the fact
that officer expressed surprise. It was at this
period that he sent his dispatch to the de-.
partment, giving absolute information of the
presence ot the Spaniards, and Sigsbee had
carried this message to Mole St. Nicholas.
Admiral Schley said that after locating the
fleet ' in Santiago he formed the blockade in
the only way he believed such a small squad
ron could be utilized for such duty. The ships
were in column broadside on to the entrance
of the harbor so that a simple turn of the
wheel yould bring them in line if the enemy
appeared. He called the captains of his ships
aboard and explained his idea of the blockade
to thorn and also his general plan of attack.
His plan was to attack the head of the column
first and confuse and cripple each in turn. The
picket boats were to be used as- torpedo-boat
destroyers. The ships were to maintain steam
so as to become capable of twelve knots.
The fleet steamed back and forth before the
entrance of the harbor. Morro CaEtle, he
thought, was at no time more than five miles
away. He judged this by the distinctness with
which he could see the purl. The bottoms of
all his 6hips were foul, perhaps a knot or a
knot and a half slower than they should have
been. "The admiral explained how the fleet
steamed back and forth, using the bold head
lands at night to determine their position, with
the picket boats always inside. Every night,
except when rain squalls occurred, and they
were usually brief, the admiral .testified that
he could see the pickets either with the naked
eye or with night glasses. He never went to"
bed without looking for them, and there was
not a night when he could not distinguish thÂ»
land and Morro. In concluding his description
of the blockade that had been maintained the
admiral said: i.
He had arrived with the squadron off Santi
ago at about 7 p. m., May 2S, he said, and
had then taken up his position five or six
miles out, afterward holding the fleet In
formation day and night. He had at night
sent the Marblehead closer in with instruc
tions to keep close watch. That night he said
Le noticed signals on Ihe shore and he had
also observed at that time lights on a lower
plane which he had since been convinced were
from the Colon lying in the harbor.
Here Admiral Schley brought his narrative
up to Santiago and he said in that connection
that he had regarded the orders of the der-art
ment concerning the probable presence of the
Spanish fleet at Santiago as more of a sug
gestion than a mandatory order. He consid
ered that it would take only a little while to
get back in any event. Also he repeated that
the ' proper military maneuver would be to
proceed westward toward the bases at Havana
and Key West.
Arrival Off Santiago.
Continuing, he said, that even as Jate as the
following morning Philip had signaled that
both the Texas and the Merrimac had sprung
a leak. The admiral also referred to th,> ex
treme heat, saying it was so great that the
men were exhausted and the doctors ' had rec
ommended that on this account coaling opera
tion be buspended.
The witness then â¢ returned to the retrograde
movement, saying: "Touching the question of
the retrograde movement after the . Merrimac
had broken, down, the movement was not
made to the westward until toward 9 o'clock,
the Yale having had considerable difficulty in
getting a hawser to her. Tbat hawser parted
about 11 o'clock that night. I was signaled
by Captain WieeUJr the Yale that it would
take about four Hours to break out a steel
1-awser. The ship at that time was absolutely
unmanageable, tshe was not capable of turn
ing a propeller. I do not think we got under
way again until 4 o'clock of the afternoon of
the 27th and not long afterward she was taken
in tow, steaming to the westward.
"We went a little larther than I had In
tended on account of the difficulty in getting
the Yale to hear our signals. We were obliged
to go four or five miles farther on that ac
count. As soon^as the sea calmed down, and
in my judgment it was not possible to have
coaled (as I said yesterday that was one of
the conditions which I watched especially and
was a better judge of that than any other
officer of the fleet, because 1 was especially
Interested In It). I signaled to Captain Philip,
asking 'if he could coal and I think his signal
indicated precisely that he was uneasy about
It for he signaled back to me: 'I can try.'
The impression left upon my mind was that
at that time even he was uncertain."
statement that the dispatch was dated May
27 and not received until June 10. Then drop
it. Just srive the facts." .
\u25a0 To this Admiral Schley responded ' that this
was all he had Intended to do. Thirteen daya
had elapsed before he received the dispatch.
Proceeding:, Admiral Schley testified that he
believed that Captain Cotton's statement con
cerning the offer of Lieutenant Field to go
ashore at Santiago to learn positively whether
the Spanish fleet was in Santiago was some
what faulty and he detailed some facts re
lating to Field" 8 offer which fixed his own
impression of it in his mind. On May 31, after
the bombardment of the Colon and after Cap
tain Cotton had gone for Mole St. Nicholas
with a report to the department upon that
subject. Admiral Schley testified that he sent
Nunez, the pilot, westward to communicate
with the Insurgents. Nur.ez landed near
Asceredores, fifteen or sixteen miles west of
Santiago, and joining some of the Cuban in
surgents, went into the interior. He returned
June 1 or 2 with detailed information of the
location of the Spanish ships in the harbor.
"I sent him," added Admiral Schley. "to the
commander In chief with that information."

Weak and sick women, especially those
suffering from diseases of long standing,
are invited to consult Dr. Pierce, by letter,
free. All correspondence is held as
strictly private and sacredly confidential.

be devoted to gayety and hospitality.
A series of luncheons will be given each
Wednesday.' The guests will include the
prominent young, people who will figure

who- are friends of Mrs. Roosevelt. This
programme has been prepared in 'order
that Miss Alice may be familiar with her
future associates before her formal pre
sentation to society on January 2.
Mrs. Roosevelt will make a short trip to
New York in the coming month. During
the rush of events following her hus
band's succession to the Presidency she
found ho" leisure to. prepare her wardrobe
for the coming' winter. She has always
been noted for the simplicity of her tastes
and the preparations which she made for
the season as wife of the Vice President
are entirely inadequate for the first lady
of the land. .Mrs. Roosevelt will remain in
New York about a week. '
It is stated by her friends that her toi

After the german general dancing was
in order.
The next assembly and german of the
Entre Nous Club will be held on Friday
evening, November 29, at the Palace
Hotel. \u25a0:;., .
THE first cotillon of the season was
danced last evening in the new
ballroom of the Palace Hotel. It
was given by the members of the
Entre Nous Cotillon Club and
proved a brilliant opening for the twelfth
season of the fashionable organization.
The new ballroom, in reality the old
supper-room. Is a decided improvement
on the Maple room, where the dances of
the Entre Nous were held in former sea
sons. It is such a spacious and elegant
apartment that decorations are altogether
unnecessary- The members of the club
recognized this fact and left the room
Just as It is.
The nine debutantes made their initial
bow to society at the cotillon. They
were: Miss Pearl Haas, Miss Alma Cut
ter, Miss Pauline Ryder, Miss Florence
McCoy, Miss Josephine D. Jones, Miss
Lottie Haskell. Miss Alice Weymouth,
Miss Katherine Meyer and Miss Mae D.
Keeffe All of the debutantes were be
comingly gowned in white. They were
loaded down with flowers and received a
great deal of attention.
Sanford G. Lewald led the cotillon,
assisted by Miss Gladys Delzell.' Six fig
ures, all new and extremely pretty, were
danced- I thought the most effective was
the "flag ot all nations," and as the
merry revelers moved through the.meas
ures of the dance, each waving a tiny
silken banner, the effect was a most bril
liant one. In the first set were the fol
lowing dancers:

Avhen she made that turn I do not think she
separated herself beyond 600 yards, because
when she turned from the Viscaya her distance
was a little less than 1100 yards. After that
range was given we had advanced a little, and
when she turned around the leading ship of the
Spanish fleet, at least the ship of that fleet
Admiral â¢ Schley next referred to the testi
mony given before the court v by Admiral .Tay
lor, who during the Santiago campaign, com
manded the battleship Indiana. "Admiral
Taylor," he said, "has testified here that he
raw the Brooklyn pass 'a' mile and a half south
r>f the line that day. Captain Taylor's posi
tion was distant, from that of the BrooKlyn
possibly four miles. ' -. J
"In the preparation of the Senate executive
document, which is before the court, the state
ment Is made that the movement of the Brook
lyn in making the loop separated her 800 yards
from the enemy. . Captain Taylor was a mem
ber of the board which made that declaration.
His evidence /of 300 yards as testified to here
does not agree with that fact.
Admiral Cervera, the witness said, thanked
him .for his courtesy, saying he had i never
met a sailor who was not a gentleman, but
declined the proffer, only asking to be al
lowed to send a . dispatch to his Government
announcing the fate of his squadron.
"I told him there would be no objection to
that whatever,", said the witness. "And
that," the admiral paid, \u25a0 closing his narrative
Impressively, "ended the battle of the third
day of July. 1898."
i "I wish to add," he continued, "that I was
very much impressed on that day -with the
fact that the officers and the men who were
engaged - In that struggle fulfilled in the very
highest and in the very noblest degree the
traditions of the American navy."
Returning 'from this chase ' Admiral Schley
told of passing the Iowa, when he was hailed
by Captain Evans, who informed him that
Admiral Cervera was on board and would like
very much to see him. Admiral Schley said
that he then went on board the Iowa, having
in the meantime directed his. men not to cheer,
as he did not think it would be proper to ex
ult over a foe who had fought and behaved so
gallantly. *
"I found the Spanish admiral greatly de
jected," said the witness. "I said to him I
knew he had lost everything, . clothing as well
as money, and I informed him that my ward
robe, as well as my purse, as far as that would
go, was at his service."
After this story of the battle, told by the
senior officer who had participated In It. the
vast audience, which had listened for an hour
in almost breathless quiet, appeared to shift
about slightly and then to settle down for the
remainder of the narrative. Then the admiral
told of the pursuit of the strange vessel, how
he had met the Vixen and been informed it
was the battleship Pelayo and how when it
was ultimately run down it proved to be the
Austrian cruiser Maria Teresa, "which was
bound for Santiago to carry away neutrals
before the city was attacked by the American
forces.

and said that I was prepared, if he had not
come up, to have sent a force of fifty or sixty
men, mechanics and marines, on board to take
possession, to avoid anything like â my impres
sion is that I used the words 'monkeying with
her.' I said that because they were throwing
something overboard which afterward proved
to be breech blocks and I thought that there
might be some possibility of injuring her piping
below, wounding her and so on. As soon as
he mentioned to me to take the Oregon- and
go eastward and meet this ship which had
been seen by the Resolute I must say I felt
some little delight, because I thought that
after the admirable work of the squadron on
that day and the part that the Brooklyn and
Oregon had in it there was nothing that car
ried Spanish colors that we should have hesi
tated to meet."
Raynor here began a series of question
to the witness Intended to develop Mints of
the controversy which he evidently felt the
admiral had' not broughtout sufficiently "He
asked Admiral Schley Â«if he knew anything o/
an order which went to the men on the Brook
lyn durimr the early vpart of .the battle of
July 3 to "stand by to ram," to which th
admiral replied, "Yes; ..I directed that order"
myself because I called the attention of Cap
tain Cock at the time we were' standing in to
the Spanish ships and said, 'Look out They
are'iroinsr to ram you.' There was a distinct
attempt on the part of .both the Theresa and
Viscaya to ram. There is no doubt about it. â¢
.They. were coming directly at us and I do not
think I .mistook their intention at all. . It was
only after the Viscaya bad changed her course
Raynor asked if he remembered the conver
sation on the BrooV-n between Hodeson â¢,i
Captain Cook, ' to which the latter hid te^i
fled; when the former called the attention or
the captain of the Brooklyn to the Texas and
Captain Cook had replied: "Oh y e , r wJ
the Texas." The admiral repiled that "hi.
thought he did recall It. ' P that he
The Admiral said he was unable to recall a
conversation with' Captain McCalla on July 3,
when the latter had said to Admiral; Schley,
according to Captain McCalla's statement en
the witness stand, "That there was glory
enough for all." Admiral Schley said he had
first seen this sentiment as formulated ac
credited to Senator Hale. - "Senator Hale," -he
said, "expressed my feeling at the time, and
that feeling I still hold."
Speaking further on this subject Admiral
Schley aaid: .-"My report had been practically
written. I do not think I added any material
fact to It, as I wrote it on the way down to
Guantanamo. I cannot recollect Captain Mc-
Calla's observation at all. In fact, a contro
versy was not thought of at that time."
Here Raynor reminded Admiral Schley that
he had stated that at the beginning of the
battle the ships charged in accordance with'
the original plan. "Now," he asked, "with
whom did that plan originate?"
"That was the general order of the com
mander in chief during the time of the block
ade, but that failed because the enemy suc
ceeded really in passing the battle line," re
plied Admiral Schley.
Raynor next asked his client concerning the
reported colloquy between himself and Lieu
tenant Commander Hodgson during the
Brooklyn's turn on "July 3. "Did you" he
asked, "at any time within the hearing or
presence of Mr. Hodgson use the words attri
buted to you at one time by Mr. Hodgson?"
Responding, the admiral said: "No, I have
not the slightest remembrance or recollection
of using any "such words. I have so stated to
Mr. Hodgson. I think it is a simple matter
of recollection with him. Mr. Hodgson Is a
very honorable officer and I think the fault
lies with his memory rather than otherwise "
In response to Raynor; Admiral Schley de
tailed the particulars of his correspondence
with Lieutenant Commander Hodgson regard
ing the publication of this alleged colloquv
saying that because of the original publication
he had thought proper to ask Mr. Hodgson for
an explanation. "Mr. Hodgson," â¢ he said
"wrote me quite a long letter in relation to
this matter, containing terms that appeared
to me so Intemperate, bo denunciatory of this
article that I felt it should not be published
as it would provoke upon him probably a
severe and unnecessary assault. I wrote him
then that this was a disposition on the sub
ject of the propriety or Improprieties from his
point ot view. I also wrote him that this was
a distinct colloquy, the tendency of which
he, of course, understood and knew i So that
I wanted him to say whether that' was true
or not, in his own interests as well as mln*
"I suggested to him that his answer, what
ever he might say, should be short because *t
that time he was before a court of Inquiry fn
relation to the matter of the grounding o/the
Brooklyn and he was unusually anxious. That
letter I published. It provoked, of course a
reply that led to an investigation in whinh
Mr. Hellner involved himself, but I neve? was
asked anything about it. I was not J"

the Oregon? It Is also an essential quality of
a bank president. But does it follow that in
selecting a man to place at the head of a
preat financial institution, as, for instance, the
California or the Nevada or the Hibernia
Bank, honesty is the all-surflcient qualifica
tion?- Does not common sense suggest that the
man fitted for these positions must possess some
other qualification besides honesty: that before
he can be made a general and intrusted with
the lives of soldiers he Â«must have adequate
knowledge of war; that before he caii be ap
pointed commander of a line of battle ship he
must know the science of the gea; that before
he can be made manager of a bank he must
have mastered the intricacies of the realm of

Workingmen of San Francisco, because Mr.
Schmitz Is a pleasing violinist and an honest
gentleman, would you. therefore, give him
command of a military expedition to the Phil
ippines, or place him at the head of the naval
squadron which protects our commerce in the
Indian Ocean? Because he is a pleasing vio
linist and an honest gentleman would you,
therefore, on that account eelect him as the
president of one of our great banks? Because
he is a pleasing violinist and an honest gen
tleman would you feel that your life would
not be exposed by his lack of competency
were you enlisted in a regiment which he com
manded In time of battle? Would you feel
quite secure from drowning upon a ship of
which he was the sailing master? Would you
deem that your funds would always be wisely
and safely invested were you a depositor in
a bank of which he 'had the management?
I need not pause for a reply to these ques
tions. They are answered as soon as they
are put. And would you, then, simply because
he is honest, place this young musician at the
head of the affairs of this great metropolis,
though you know he has never had the slight
est training, study, experience or knowledge
of the subject? Will you simply because he is
honest entrust him with the management of
the affairs of this city? Will you place In
his hands the fate of its commerce, Its In
dustry and its financial prosperity with which
your own welfareâ aye. the welfare of each
man of' youâ is bo intimately . connected and
upon which it so absolutely depends? Do you
think the men who control now, and have con
trolled for years, the great enterprises of this
city will feel entirely safe under a government
of which such a man is the head? r>o you
think they will consider this a field for ex
tending, or even retaining, the investments of
their capital? And if they do not, where is
the labor, upon which you all depend, to
come from?
Workingmen of San Francisco, hardy sons
of toil, upon whose broad shoulders the pros
perity of our State must ultimately rest, pause
and reflect before you commit yourselves to so
fatal a course. Do not expose this metropolis,
do not expose your homes,' do not expose your
savings, do not expose yourselves to the un
necessary hazard of entrusting the helm of
government to the unexperienced, untaught,
unskillful hands of -this young artist. The
stake is too great. The risk is too momentous.
No wise and thoughtful man can look forward
without apprehension to the possible conse
quences.

NEW TORK, Oct. 25.â Althougn
the date of Senator Chaunce/
M. Depew's marriage to Miss
May Palmer has not been defin
itely fixed, it Is understood that
it will be celebrated within a few weeks.
A few days ago Senator Depew stated
that it would occur this winter, but more
recently Miss Palmer's sister, a Von
Andre, before sailing for her home in
London, ' said: "The wedding will take
place in a few weeks at my home."
Immediately "after the ceremony Sen
ator Depew and- bride will leave for
"Washington, as Congress will then be in
session, and after the adjournment of
Congress will go abroad again.
Miss Palmer is described by Senator
Depew as a very beautiful girl. She
inherits her beauty from her mother, who
\u25a0was one of the three Hermann sisters of
New Orleans, all famous beauties. She
has a perfect figure, large blue eyes, and
a mass of chestnut hair. She is in face
and figure the type of the young woman
that C. D. Gibson, the artist, delights to
draw. Miss Palmer was educated in
Germany. She has lived abroad since the
death of her father, thirty years ago. He
was a New York banker bdfore taking up
his residence in Paris. Miss Palmer is.
related to Hermann and Charles Oe:
richs. One of her mother's sisters became
the wife of Hall McAllister, the noted
California lawyer.- 7

As to ths uncoupling of the engines Admiral
Schley testified that he thought they were un
coupled by a standing order of the commander
in chief. At the same time â¢ he said he be
lieved the uncoupling was wise, both because
it would keep down the heat below decks,
which was well nigh insufferable for the men
as it was, and also on account of the desirabil
ity of economizing coal. â¢'
Raynor then asked Admiral Schley if he had
asked ' Admiral Sampson if there were any
signals with the â¢insurgents.
"I did," he replied, "but the â¢ admiral said
he knew of none."
Rayncr then called the attention of Admiral
Schley to the following dispatch, dated Key
West, Fla.,.May 21, \u25a0 1898, ; to the Secretary of
the Navy:
"Schley has been' ordered to Santiago de
Cuba. . . SAMPSON.'*
Raynor asked if he had ever been ordered
to Santiago before the dispatch of May 27,
which it had been stated he did not receive
until June 10, to which the admiral replied:
"No, except under order No. 8, leaving the
matter to my discretion."
"There Is nothing then between order No. 8
and the dispatch I have given?"
"No, nothing."
Here Raynor reminded the witness that there
had been more or less discussion' of the possi
bility of the escape of the Spanish squadron
through the blockading line at either Cien
fuegos or Santiago without being detected,
and requested from the admiral an expression
on the subject. Responding, Admiral Schley
said:
"I do not believe that that could have. been
possible, simply because \u25a0 the '-squadron, from
the position which it occupied before these
ports, always would have had that squadron,
had it attempted to escape, under its gun fire.
I had no trouble in seeing the beach 90 per
cent of the time, and I looked at it-wlth every
care."
Here Raynor asked a number of questions
concerning interviews with Captains Cotton
and Wise and other officers, intended to bring
out information to make perfect the record.
Admiral Schley also reviewed the testimony of
Lieutenant Wood, Lieutenant Hood and Cap
tain McCalla.
The court then adjourned until Monday morn
ing at 11 o'clock. . '

unacquainted with grief, sympathizing In every

you cannot conceive him. yet even in imagina
tion you cannot picture him as praying to
heaven to establish and perpetuate in this na
tion a government of the people by the working
clays for the benefit of the working class. His
prayer was hemmed and circumscribed within
no such narrow limits. His aspirations were
eramiW within no such dwarfing bounds. His
proclamation of the equality of man. spurning
all paltry and artificial distinctions of rank or
wealth or class, was commensurate with hu

Parasites Cause All Hair Troubles.
Nine-tenths of the diseases of the scalp
and hair are caused by parasite germs.
The importance of this discovery by Pro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg, Germany, cannot be overesti-
mated. It explains why ordinary hair
preparations, even of the most expensive
character, fail to cure 'dandruff; because
they do not and they cannot kill the dan-
druff germ. The only, hair preparation
in the world that positively destroys the
dandruff parasites that -burrow up the
scalp into scales called scurf, or dandruff,
is Newbro's Herpicide. In addition to its
destroying the dandruff germ Herpicide is
also' a delightful hair dressing, making
the hair glossy and soft as silk.

PLATINUMâ J. F. O., Barstow, Sail
Bernardino, Cal. Platinum is a grayish
white metal, with a high luster. Its spe
cific gravity Is 2L15, one of the heaviest
substances known. The specific gravity
of gold is 19.3; of lead 1L4 and of iron 7.8.
In placer mining platinum is found with
gold and can be separated by the use of
mercury, which takes up -the gold and
allows the platinum to remain. Platinum
is found with many metals, and is gen
erally discovered In small, glistening
granules. ' Once seen there Is no difficulty
in distinguishing it from "glistening iron
ore."

ROSE SPRINGâ H.. Berkeley^ Cal. A

County/five miles due north of Folsom
and about six miles east of Roseville, In

precinct. It was a mining town or camp
in the. early days, and is at the present

I GOLD HALVES AND QUARTERSâ H.
W. B., - Nevada City. Cal. The United
States mints never coined 60 or 25 cent
gold pieces. The smallest gold coin issued
out of 'the mints was the $1 piece author
ized by the act of March 3, 1849. Coins of
that denomination were coined from that
year up to and including 18S9, when the
coinage was discontinued.
The allied powers have established a formidable
guard around the foreign legation buildings at Pe
king, but the heads of the Chinese Government re
fuse to return to the capital; so now the* question
is how the Ministers are to transact business with the
wily Chinamen. They are apparently at Peking just
as far away, from the seat of the Chinese Government
as they; would have been had they stayed at Hong
kong. - :' â¢
AS the discussion of the reciprocity treaties and
of the suggested changes in the tariff proceeds
it becomes more and more evident that the,
opponents of the protective system will probably
unite upon reciprocity as a means of making an open
ing for eventual free trade. It is true that if Con
gressman Babcock should bring up in Congress his
plan for tariff revision it would have the support of
all the opponents of protection, but even the most
sanguine of such opponents are not hopeful of any
great results from. what is now known as "Babcock
ism." In the reciprocity treaties, on the other, hand,
they perceive what they, regard as a bright prospect"
for success, and it is certain they will make earnest
efforts. to accomplish something this winter, in that
way. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 Â» '.
A recent dispatch from Washington announces that
it has been decided by the advocates of reciprocity to
abandon the fight for the treaty with Argentine and
to concentrate their energies upon' the other trea
ties. â¢ The reason announced for the determination is
that the advocates of the treaties have fourrd that the
wool industry, which would be hurt by the Argentirfe
treaty, is too strong to be attacked. It will be their
plan, therefore, to divide the friends of protection, if
possible.. They will promise the wool men immunity
if the wool men will co-operate in bringing about the
ratification of the other treaties. The Argentine
treaty is to be abandoned, not because the free traders
believe it to be objectionable, but because they wish
to have greater freedom in making the fight for the
other treaties. ,
If the wool men be. deceived by that kind of tactics
they will have more wool over their eyes than we
think they have. It has long been evident to intelli
gent Americans that the protective system must be
maintained in' its entirety or else it will be in danger
of disappearing altogether. Any policy of granting
protection to some industries while denying it .to
others is doomed to failure. The American people
will not support it. The fight against a misuse of
reciprocity . in the direction of free trade must be
made .unitedly. There is no division that can be
tolerated. -
Fi ROM the benefit given by the Theatrical ( Man
agers' Association something more than $1400
was received by the McKinley memorial fund.
The total amount subscribed up to this time ap
proaches $25,000. It seems,, then, well' assured that
we are to have a memorial that will be worthy of the
man and of the city. Certainly the raising of so
large a fund in a time comparatively so short and
without recourse to extraordinary means is a proof
that the hearts of the people are in the movement and
that they are animated by patriotism and liberality.
A work so well begun should be carried forward
by the same impulse that started it. It should not be
found necessary to resort to any adventitious means
of stimulating contributions. It is to be a popular
manifestation of the love borne to McKinley by the
people of California, and of their recognition of the
great place he is destined to hold for all time in the
history of the Pacific Coast and the expansion of
American energy across the Pacific Ocean.
Where every one contributes something it will. not
be required that any one should give much. To raise
the sum needed to erect a 1 truly noble memorial ought
not to be difficult in a city of this size and among
a people so prosperous and so proverbially. generous
and patriotic. Let every citizen bear the subject in
mind and make such contribution to it as. his means
justify. The movement is no longer an experiment
Enough has been accomplished to assure some meas
ure of success. It remains with the people to deter
mine whether they will raise that success to aVdis
tinct artistic triumph and have a share in it them
_selves.by contributing to the fund. "

MISUSE OF RECIPROCITY.
â¢p-* ROM the efforts recently begun on tnc part- of
M the Manufacturers' and Producers'- Association
â¢*. to bring about the co-operation of the Native
buns and Native Daughters in the work of advancing
California industries good results have been already
obtained. The young men and women to whom the
appeals were made have been prompt to respond and
to pledge assistance in making California -a- home
market .for liome products. I?y their example others â¢'
will be influenced. In that respect, then, jthe associa
tion has started a good movement in the right direc
tion. . , .
. 'As a further means of developing and expanding
the markets for California goods the association.pur
poses to publish and distribute widely throughout the
Union and in foreign countries a descriptive cata
logue of our commercial products, natural and manu
factured. The officials of the association have found
that notwithstanding-all that has been written of Cali
fornia there is nothing in print available for general
use and wide distribution containing anything ap
proaching a complete list .of.the natural and artificial
productions of the State as a whole, and it is to sup
ply that need that the new catalogue is to be pre
pared. ' , â¢
The full extent o| _the resources and the industries
of California are^not understood even by its own
people, and consequently^ the work -that is to be com
piled by the â¢ as^opatiorf '-\\4ll contain much informa
tion that will be.new/eyeri to well-informed Califor
nians themselves." : An. illustration is at hand. ' A re
cent report oLthe association points .out that nearly
one-third of the entire raisin product- of the State is
put up in the form of s'ee'deo! raisins, an industry per
fected here and commercially successful only in thjs
State. The statement will unquestionably be a mat
tef*of news to a large number of persons who deem
themselves well posted on our fruit "industries.
In many other directions the.' energies of the offi
cers of the association have achieved important bene
fits for our industry and our commerce. The secre-.
tary's report of recent work done by -the association
shows that in co-operation with other commercial
bodies material reductions from the rates originally
prioposed..by J the Philippine^ Commission = have been
obtained in the duty finally imposeti upon flour,
canned fruits, canned salmon and gasoline hereafter
imported- into the. Philippines. Through like co
operation the imposition -of a duty on flour to be
imported into China during the interim 'before the
filial revision of the Chinese tariff was avoided, and
there is now hope that it may be possible to prevent
altogether the placing of a duty in the Chinese
tariff upon this important product of the Pacific.

to' be. immensely advantageous, to the; community as
a whole. The Manufacturers* and Producers' Asso

Cust proceeds to trace the story of the
sketch book from the date of December,
1641, when Vandyke died at Blackfriars.
London, and his studio was left at the
mercy of his pupils and assistants, who
helped themselves to what they fancied.
In that way began the travels of many a
Vandyke relic, >b.ut it ia enough to have
the description of this one sketch book.
It is a small quarto volume, bound orig
inally In white vellum, and contains 22 Â»
leaves, the pages having a double num
bering. There Is no system of arrange
ment of the sketches! , The majority were
made with pen and bistre-colored ink,
heightened by the \u25a0 use of a brush with
the same ink. Some appear to have been
made with a light pencil In outline, which
are almost faded, so that the sketches
have in certain cases been drawn over
with a pen, probably, by some later pos
sessor of -the book.- -. .
system and care allow. If a registered
letter is lost the authorities will trace it
up, and In case of loss beyond recovery
the department will pay an indemnity, not
to exceed $10.
The book was by George Downes, A. M.,
and was published by Gallgnani. Tho
library of the Alpine Club, I believe, pos
sesses no copy, nor is It mentioned 'In the
comprehensive biblography of Swiss trav
el and Swiss* guide books by the Rev. W.
A. B. Cooledge. who indeed i gives Murray
the credit of having: been the first m the
field."- Yet It Js an excellent- work, evi
dently for the most part the original pro
duct of personal experience.
One of the treasures of the Duke of
Devonshire's library at Chatsworth is the
sketch book which belonged to Sir "An
thony "Vandyke. A notable art 'volume
arising out of this is announced for pub
lication by Messrs. 'Bell, with a descrip
tion of the sketch book by Lionel Cust
and ' reproductions of many ot the
sketches. Of these Cust says:
"They are indubitably the work of An
thony Vandyke, and they furnish a most
precious record. of his sojourn in Italy
during the years 1625-1638."
Standing by v was a collector, and when
he heard the girl's remark he pricked up
his \u25a0 ears, for he happened .to remember
that very moment that wlth.,the exception
of- a 'translation of I a German work no
English ' guide book for Switzerland Is
known to have .been .published before the
appearance of the first edition of Murray,
in 1833. ; So when the young ladles had de
parted with fourpennyworth of * heart
throbs he seized on the discarded, volume
and found he had secured a prize for
which, owing to the present rage for rare
ties in Alpine literature, he could prob
ably obtain as many pounds as he hal
paid pence, and which, apart from sordid
considerations of any kind, was a wel
come addition to his treasures.
Here Is the strange part" of the story,
which shows how a- chance remark over
heard In the street may lead to much.- .
Two pretty young girls werÂ© turning
over a cheap tray at a second-hand book
stall. "All these at fourpence each" had
attracted them. They were canvassing
the merits of paper-backed novels and va
rious verse volumes of the "hearts' darts"
class. One of the girls took up a little
fat book bound in green skin, but threw
it down with a sniff of contempt as she
said: "Guide to Switzerland,- 1827! A pre
cious lot of use that would be now!"

output count for virtues in a writer Mm. i

ings consist of sixty-nine novels and 230
short stories; a sufficient achievement for
a writer who has hardly reached middle
life and is still full of possibilities.
Playwritlng Is at present occupying her
attention. It is a curious fact that thougn
the dramatic version of "Booties' Baby"
had not a particularly striking success,
and though the author had only a fourth
part in the profits, it yielded her more
than â¢ the novel itself. This experience
doubtless induced her seriously to attempt
original playwrlting. It Is probable that
two of her dramas win shortly be seen in
the West End-
Mrs. Stannard, who recently returned to
London after six years' residence at
Dieppe, lives in a pleasant house In West
Kensington. She Is a woman of very ob
viously Ftrong Individuality, and talto
with volubility and not a little humof.
She has a passion for collecting old
china, and numbers many beautiful spec
imens among her possessions, most of
which, she tells you with considerable en
joyment, she picked up at cheap sales.
San Francisco possesses another person
of the same ilkâ a politician for payâ who
has been vigorously lampooned and cari
catured by the press, who once turned on
his tormenters with a. suit for libel and
recovered $1 as damages. It has been
popular to revile him as unutterably low.
Will some one kindly explain the differ
ence â the moral difference Is meantâbe
tween this man -and -the dictator? The
writer believes -none can be shownâ that
the difference, if any, is merely in sound,
and that both should be pilloried upon
the same platform at the same time.
"Arcades .ambo,' [ "id" est, blackguards
both!"
In the opinion; of t>ie writer so long as
the dictator remains in power it will be
utterly useless for any straightforward,
honest, self-respecting Republican â one
who will not consent to be numberel
among the "useful"â to aspire to political
office In this city.
Republican cattle, behold your sham
bles and your driver! Enter In and await
the butcher and his knife!
A REPUBLICAN.
San Francisco, Oct. 24. .
A Few Words to Republican?.!
Editor Tha Callâ At- this --writing the
signs point to -a Democratic success this
fall, and yet before any nominations were
made it seemed as though the Republi
cans could " Baf sly anticipate a sweeping
â¢ victory- But one thing could have caused
such a change in so short a periodâ the
action qf the nominating convention.^ No
doubt there are good and honest "men on
-the ticket; no doubt also that < there are
many tools upon it, placed there -for fu
ture usefulnessâ placed there, in â¢, the ex
pectation that 'hey would be able to run
the race in a "yellow dog" year. Wh* t
gross Ignorance, or what duplicity â chooss
the phrase ypu preferâ the party dictator
has displayed in hls^political slate mak
ing! While every thinking person be
lieves that the Republican ticket, cave
possibly .as to a few Individuals, Is
doomed for the reason that Republicans
will not tolerate a "yellow dog" (euphem
ism for rascal politician) merely because
of the party collar, the dictator passes
along with uptllted chin and expansive
smile as though he considered everything
won. Perhaps' r.e does, but can the reader
tell what "everything won" means? The
dictator la a Demo.crat, and he-4Â« at once
the attorney for powerful corporation,
and the manipulator, or dictator rather,
of Republican politics. Does, anybody
suppose . that "everything won", means
more to him than. that he has served tns
clients well? Is politics to this man any
thing more than a business, i. e., any
thing more than an adjunct to the busi
ness of the corporations whom he is em
ployed to serve at so much per annum?
If not, is It to be supposed that he would
willingly allow any Republican to be nom
inated or elected whom he could not con
trol?

â¢Â» jt ESSAGES received by wire from New York represent
l\ f\ that General Hubbard yesterday bought all the Hunt
/ V 1 lngton holdings In the Pacific Improvement Company.
â¢*\u25a0"â¢Â»â¢ The sum paid for 12,500 shares-^or , one-fourth . of the
stock of thg corporationâwas $2,500,000. or: $200 ; per
share. It Is not known at thls^tlme. whether .-General Hub
bard purchased the stock on his own" account or for others.
- The local impression is that he bought for the Crockers. f: \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'
f There are reports to the effect that Mrs- Stanford's 12,500
chares may soon be acquired by- the same interest that pur
chased the Huntington stock. The capital stock of the company
consists. of 50,000 shares. When the corporation was organized
and the stock issued each of the four railway magnates-
Charles Crocker, Leland Stanford, Mark 'Hopkins' and C. P.
Huntingtonâ took a fourth interest, or 12,500 . shares. Not a
share was sold during the lifetime of the principals, and the
transaction . in New York yesterday was the first sale on the
part of the legatees. Much of the property of the corporation,
consisting of street railways, tracts. of land, coal mines, steam
ships, terminal privileges, bonds, stocks etc, has been sold out
right from time to time during the past two years. Consider-
able moneyâ perhaps $10,000,000â has been derived by the stock
holders of the corporation from the sale of such properties.
The price paid by General Hubbard for the Huntlngton
block of 12,500 shares places the value of the property remaia
lng unsold at $10,000,000.
When Mrs. Stanford sold her Southern Pacific stock at a
large flguro The Call estimated that she would be ; able to
bestow a much larger sum on the university than Governor
Stanford expected to realize from this source. At that time an
approximate estimate was made that the university would b*
further enriched by $5,000,000 from the Stanford holdings In tha
Pacific Improvement Company. The sale yesterday signifies
that the estimate was not far from the true mark.
It Is known that the Southern Pacific 'Company is using,
under lease or other arrangement, many of the facilities owned
by the Pacific Improvement Company. It may transpire that
the new owners of the Southern Pacific were the actual buy
ers in yesterday's transaction, an'd that General Hubbard sim
ply acted as the agent of the Vanllerbllts and Harrlman.
Should the Croekers sell their stock in the P. I. Company the.
impression would be strengthened that the Southern Pacific Is
the actual buyer. ->Â»i:.'

City government has everything to learn from the administration of private corpo
rations. It can* teach them nothing. It' can learn nothing from the national govern
ment. What would be thought of a candidate for the presidency of the Southern Pacific
Railway or the San Francisco. Savings Union if he should go among the stockholders and.
say, "I seek this place as a representative of the Democratic party."/ He would be hooted
out of the contest. But if he went saying, "I stand here representing no party, person
ality, or sect, but only honest and-profitab,le management of. the business* Tbf these r stock
holders," every one would recognize the propriety of his position. , :
Mr. Tobin presents himself for the headship of this municipal corporation, rep
resenting nothing but its honest management in the interest- of all its stockholders, 'and
with no strings on him pulled by bosses or leaders of any class.
The city has in his election its . first opportunity to put in practice the ideal
municipal policy. ' "' â¢ . â¢'-.
If experts like Allen Ripley Foote are right, and there is no presumption that they
are wrong, the way to lead municipal government out of the mire is indicated by Mr.
Tobin's declaration.
There must arise in our great cities a new form of partisanship that will draw to
gether in a common purpose members of both national parties^ This partisanship will be
formed on distinctly municipal issues. It will regard all citizens and taxpayers as stock
holders in the municipal corporation! . They pay assessments to that corporation in pro
portion to the stock they hold. Their dividends are in the form of good, clean, decent,
economical government. They pay for and will demand good public schools, adequate
police and fire protection, good sewers, clean streets, sufficient parks well imp'roved. to
serve the health and pleasure of old and young. If they embark upon other municipal
experiments, and try municipal ownership of any public utilities, they will demand such
public accounting as will, inform them of the cost of the experiment. They will not per
mit juggling in the interest of communists or theorists/When these objects are accom
plished what is there left to be done in a city? Nothing. Its administration is a business
matter exclusively. Its administration, should be adequately paid for the time.they give
to its business, as the directors and officers of a private corporation are paid, and they
should be expected to show results just as such officers and employes are.
IN a brief address on Thursday night Mr. Tobin stated the issue of this city cam
paign. He said: "I- stand here representing no party, no personality, no sect. I.
stand for good citizenship and nothing else. '
"Public Policy," edited by the expert writer on municipal government, Allen Rip
ley Foote, says. that municipal policy has no necessary relation to State or national pol
itics. If a Republican city convention declare frankly for the best municipal policy and
honestly nominate men in line with that declaration,- that is municipal Republicanism,
but it has .no, relation at all to the national policies and principles that are called Repub
lican;;;/The, truth; of this is perfectly plain. Whafhas.a Mayor.,of . this city to do with the
national revenue policy, with tariff, monetary standards/ainti-trust. legislation, our foreign
policy, reciprocity, interstate commerce or enforcement of the; Federal laws? Nothing at
all. What have; our United States Senators and Representatives to do with the local
government;; of : San 'Francisco'? Nothing at all except as individuals. Therefore, how
can a candidate'for Mayor; be truly called a representative of a national party when, no
national principle or policy can apply to' anything (lone by the. city government?
Mr. Tobin 'describes: a candidate for a city office : truthfully and' exactly. In
national politics he may -belong to one of the national parties; in the city, government he
can represent. neither, for neither has any principle that applies to municipal affairs.
; The 'sooner this is understood the better will it be for municipal government. The
administration of cities has become the odium of this country. Tammany runs â¢ New
York in the name of Democracy: Quay runs Philadelphia in the name of Republicanism..
Both are badly, wastefully and .wickedly. governed,. arid the national parties whose names
are used in the operation sufferin reputation^ , ; : . ' . ." , ' 'r
The bosses have discovered the indisposition; of .people to mix national and local
politics, and have discovered alsothat this, makes voters snub the polls in city^ elections,
there beingno national principle at stake. , So the bosses, .wiser than the -children ..of
light, set up their tickets, label them Republican or Democratic/ and trust to public indif
ference to win. . w".
, .: It is significant that one candidate sees facts face to face and frankly declares that
he stands for no iparty, personality, sect nor clique, but simply-for common honesty and
upright city government. In making this declaration Mr. Tobin lifts himself ~ abr>ve~ the
sordid considerations which are among the motives of candidates who appeal for local
power on national issues, and stands for just what he is â a candidate'for a municipal office,
whose election can in no wise affect any other issue than loch] government. "

PORT TOWNSEND, Oct. 25.â With tho
arrival of the United States revenue cut
ter Bear from ihe north comes news of
another tragedy in the Arctic seas whicn
solves the mystery of the disappearance
of the schooner Â±ialcoyn and tne death
of Captain Charles Thomas.
The schooner Halcyon sailed from
Seattle early in 190u on a trading ani
prospecting cruise in the north, naving
on board six persons â Captain Charles
Thomas and Louis Picotte, tne owners of
the schooner; William. A. Egan, two
brothers named Ballard and a prospector
named Young.. After trading and pros
pecting along the Alaska coast, Nonu
was reached on November 5, a supply of
goods and provisions purchased and th.2
schooner started northward for Teller
City. When off Sledge Island the schooi.er
was becalmed, and, cold weather setting
in, she found hsrseif surrounded by slus.n
ice. Before she could get free the ice
became solid and the craft was carried
into "the main pack and with it driftel
southeast until a point many miles off
Norton Sound was â¢â¢ reached. Then the
current carried the ice pack and schooner
westward until near St. Lawrence Island,
which point was reached on January S.
While the schooner was drifting.
Picotte, the Ballard brothers and Young
left the schooner in a small boat, whlcli
they dragged some distance over the* ice.
A narrow channel was found and they
succeeded in reaching shore near Topkuk.
The other two. preferring to take chanceT
where they had provisions, remained with
the schooner. Later her condition seemed
more serious and Captain Thomas 'and
Egan abandoned her and succeeded lit
reaching . an island, bringing with them
what provisions they could carry. Cap
tain Thomas found the island unin
habited, and, against the protests oÂ£
Egan, returned to the vessel. Since that
time nothing has been heard *of th*
schooner or Captain Thomas.
Egan, after being left alone on the
island, wandered up along the northern
shore. With supplies exhausted and he
in an almost perishing condition, with his
feet frozen, he was rescued when within
forty miles of Gamble Mission by i* a
native and taken to the mission, arriving
there sixteen days after he had left the
schooner. The mission doctor amputated
Egan's toes, and when he recovered h?
entered the employ of the Government aa
reindeer herder at St. Lawrence.

"Don't scream, little girl; don't scream
like that," he said, and then ran rapidly
down the stairs. i â¢
As the light was burning in the' hall
way the servant got a good look at the
burglar, and she gave tue description of
the man- to the authorities, who hope to
soon have the well dressed stranger safe
behind prison bars.
BAKERSFIELD, Oct. 25.â A ; burglar
with the dress, carriage and manner of a
gentleman is operating in this city. Last
night he entered three residences and, al
though, he had splendid opportunities to
carry away with him much valuable sil
verware and jewelry, he took nothing but
money and succeeded in obtaining but $4
in small change. fc _
The prowler, who is referred to as the
"gentleman burglar" by the "authorities
who are searching for him, was last night
dressed in a neat black suit, a derby hat,
white shirt, high collar and a natty tie.
He had removed his shoes. and; to prevent
surprises, locked the male sleepers in
their rooms.
The first house 'entered was that of I.
N. Levy. There. he found *2 in a purse.
Next he went to the home of H. L. Blod
get and cut a screen from a window, but
was frightened away. He visited Max
Kahn's house. Finding no money in the
bureau, drawers, which he ransacked, he
departed for the dwelling of A: Alexan
der. Quietly stepping into Alexander's
room, he took the inmate's trousers and
carried them Into the hallway, locking
the door on the outside, took $2 in
small change, but. overlooked $15 Â»n gold
that was in the watch pocket. He then
went to the chambermaid's room and was
about ; to take a purse from the top of the
folding bed! when the girl awoke and
screamed for help. ..

HORN AND FERGUSON ARE
DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY
Seventy-nine of the hundred persons in
Hunt. Wilkinson & Co.'s building waen
the flre started were employes and "the
remainder \u25a0were customers, and <outside
were the workmen who were engaged in
putting the finishing touches on the new
eighth floor. . More than half of | the
firm's employes were on the 'upper five
floors, and it was among these that the
greatest number were killed and injured.
With the possible exception of the en
gineer, who is missing, all the persons
on the first three floors got out of the
building safely. The members of the firm
,At 10:20 o'clock this morning the blaze
broke forth in the building occupied by
Hunt, Wilkinson & Co. It is said that an
explosion of naphtha or gasoline In the
basement was the cause, but this is denied
by Wilkinson, who says there never was
a sufficient quantity of either explosive
about the building to be responsible for
to-day's disaster. Rumor has it also that
an elevator constructor at work in the
basement permitted the flame of his Ian-'
tern to communicate with some of the
gaseous liquors stored in the basement
and that this was the cause of the, con
flagration.
The rear of Hunt, Wilkinson & Co.'s
building faces on . Commerce street, a
small thoroughfare. On the fire escapes
at this end of the building two men and
one woman were slowly roasted to death,
while the horror-stricken throng on the
street below turned sick at the sight.
In the front on Market street a woman,
driven to desperation, leaped from - a
window on the top floor and was dashed
to death on the pavement.

curred to-day in the business sec
tion of the city. The number. of injured
is not known definitely, but fully a score
of victims were located at "various hos
pitals. Policemen and firemen are to
night delving in the ruins in search of
bodies supposed' to have been buried be
neath the debris, as it is feared that oth
ers besides the known dead may have lost
their lives in the flames. The buildings
destroyed were the eight-story structure
at 1219 and 1221 Market street, occupied
by Hunt, -Wilkinson & Co., upholsterers
and furniture dealers, and three-story
buildings occupied by small merchant
men. The big furniture building extended
back half a block to Commerce street,
and was owned by Henry Clea.

The loss to-night is estimated at half a
million dollars, "most of which will fall
on Hunt, Wilkinson & Co., whose loss is
estimated at $250,000. Henry Clea's loss
on the building is. about $150,000. William
F. Potts & Sons buffered a loss of $60,000,
while other occupants of the. Potts build-
Ing and surrounding: property owners
suffered losses aggregating- $25,000. .
Small buildings in the rear of the fur
niture building and also to the west of
the burned area were crushed by falling
walls. The fronts of the stores on the
south side of Market street opposite the
lire were all more or less damaged by -the
heat. Great tongues of flames, swept
along by the northwest wind, shot across
the broad thoroughfare and for a time
it looked as if the flre would spread to
those buildings.
Ignoring the flames for the time being,
the fire fighters devoted their whole at
tention to the work of rescue. As some
of them stood within the scorching heat
of the lire with nets outspread to receive
those who leaped from the burning build
ing their, comrades played lines of hose
upon them. - J
Most of the fatalities occurred In the
rear of the building. As if by common
impulse the majority of the employes at
tempted to reach places of safety by
means ' of the flre escapes on the Com
merce street end of the structure. Many
of them, rendered practically insane by
fright, leaped to the ground. Others, be
coming unconscious from the smoke and
intense heat, fell to the pavement. When
the firemen arrived Commerce street was
filled with these unfortunate victims. It
looked for a time as if the entire block
would become a prey to the flames, but
the falling of the walls of the burning
building prevented the spread of the flre.
. By noon the flre was under control and
at 2 o'clock this afternoon a force of men
ordered by the Department of Public
Safety began the work of clearing away
.the debris for the purpose of recovering

alarm, to the other employes. He then
hastened to the street to notify a police
man. In the meantime the employes of
the electrical bureau at the City Hall,
two blocks away, saw smoke issuing
from the building: and transmitted an
alarm td the Fire Department. When the
engines arrived the flames had enveloped
the building from top to bottom and the
intense heat from this mass of flames
made it almost impossible for the fire
men to get within close range of the
seething furnace.

COMMISSIONER' HEACOCK. lis
tened to a. potpourri of testimony
yesterday in the Nome contempt
cases. The ragged edges of the
case of the amicus curiae were
sandpapered and ex-Congressman Thomas
J. Geary went upon the stand to offer his
defense, E. S. Pillsbury, who has been
playing the part of the friend of the court
â¢with a devotion and Interest that seems
untiring, has now shot his bolt. The rest
of the proceedings will. In the main, re
late to the defense of the respondents.
The cross-examination of Geary is not
comple*ed and when the examination is
renewe this morning that work will be
undert; 3sen. A continuation will then be
allowe by Commissioner Heacock until
Monc t at 2 o'clock in order to give the
atton jb of the respondent, Arthur H.
Jsoyes-. c.n opportunity to ask of the Cir
cuit (. urt of Appeals that they should
be req red only to meet that part of the
testimJÂ».y which bears directly upon the
respondent in respect to the contempt
charges. \
At the beginning bf the morning session
Judge McLaughlin made a lengthy state
ment with this intended request as the
burden. He said that so much of the
testimony In the record shows itself to
be prima facie opinion and hearsay that
he would ask of the court to designate
.iust which portions of it he should meet.
So there will be an argumentative con
flict Monday morning at 11 o'clock before
Judges Ross. Gilbert and Morrow, Amicus
Curiae Pillsbury and Judge McLaughlin
being the drivers of the ammunition wag
on. The respondents are anxious to have
the taking: of testimony go over to some
fu~ure day. The amicus curiae is more
than anxious to have it continue until
completed.
Witnesses Flit in and Out.
While waiting: for Attorneys Knight and
Metson. Thomas J. Geary thought it
would be a .good plan for his testimony
to be taken, so he sent for his lawyer, Â«-
Julge Maguire. Then the pair of ex-Con
pressmen became the court spectacle for
the rest of the day, except for the brief
interruption that occurred when Metson
ani Knl it returned to the stand to tes
tify to acts concerning the papers of
other suÂ»Je.
Geary tcld his story in a positive man
ner, did i pt Quarrel at any time with the
air;icus curiae and appeared comfortable
and easy He relied on his belief of what
the law was, denied in some instances
words attributed to him by W. T. Hume
and showed his legal knowledge by skirt
ing: along the inner edge of the law's pale.
Hi Â« statement was given without any pro
lixity or adornment.
Geary's Defense Put In.
G^earj- testified that he first became an
attorney of the Circuit Court of Appeals
November 7, 1900. He -was attorney for
McKenzie as a receiver in the case of
Chips ve. Llnderberg and ether Anvil
Creek claims. The date of his employ
ment was October 20, and his first work
was in regard to the' bonds which the de
fer.dants saked to have increased against
McKenzie.
"Were yq- ever . employed by plaintiff or
any of the- parties in these cases?" asked
Judge MagTjtre.'
â¢â¢No; I did not know them."
"After being employed by McKenzie did you
attempt to act for either of the parties litl
frar.t?"
"I did not. McKenzie asked me if I had and
when I said no he asked me to be attorney
for the receiver, which was himself."

witness said: . - . ' â¢â¢ \u25a0\u25a0
"McKenzie was very much excited and dis
agreeable about this time, and talked of . re
sistance to the marshals. I told him that such
a course would- be ridiculous."- â¢ *
"State what occurred between yourself and
McKenzie -until the gold dost was taken from

"I told McKenzie that if the Circuit Court of
Appeals should determine that the writs were

"I did not."
"Did you. on that day tell McKenzie to dis
obey those orders?" ' â¢-Â»

Kenzie trial before the Circuit'. .Court
Judge Maguire questioned the witness on
evidence presented at that time. ; V
"As far as your conversations or meetings
with" Archie Wheeler. ' Stevens. Judge Noyea
or others, did you ever say that Alexander
McKenzie should disobey the writs and that
you would lend him . your . support- in such ac
tions?" \u25a0:\u25a0
"I â¢ never had 'a conversation with any of
these men on those subjects. I don't recollect
any such thing."
This ended the morning proceedings.
I Geary Cross-Examined. " ' '
The afternoon session saw the end of
the case as far as the eduction of evi
dence on . the part of the amicus curiae
is concerned.
George Borchsenius. Samuel Knight and
William H. Metson were called in rapid
succession and testified to facts brought
out in the court proceedings and the filing
of papers In the claim cases at- Nome. C.
W. Willard was then called to the' stand.
He testified that during the proceedings in
the McKenzie \u25a0 case An the â¢ Court of- Ap
peals he was present and heard Geary
say:
"McKenzie's acts were notin lawful dis
obedience of the court and I so advised
him and would so advise, him again."
Judge McLaughlin didn't think enough of
the -testimony to cross-examine the wit
ness. - .. .....' ."

the witness chair for the finishing of the
direct examination by Matrnire and the
cross-examination by Plllsbury.- - .
Maguire. on. the trend of exculpation for
an honest opinion honestly â¢ delivered, . inv
quired:
"Was your fee In any way dependent upon
the retention of the gold dust?"
.â "It. was not." . , . ._â¢ â¢_â¢ .. . v \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
"Were you paid for your services with Mc-
Kenzie?" - .- ...... â¢ :
'"There has' not been a complete settlement.
He was to pay me personally." "
. Geary when questioned about his optn
loh on the second -writs admitted that it
was freely given and that he believed it
to be invalid. He denied that he gave.it
with any view other than as honest ad
vice to his client.
: Plllsbury couldn't keep away from the
gold dust and the vaults and the marshals
and the warlike temper of determined
\u25a0William Metson, so Geary had to tell the
story as far as. he .figured in it. Contin
uing his testimony Geary said: ; it:
"I told Metson that I feared there would
be trouble at the bank. Then I went to Mc-
Kenzie and he said - he might be satisfied to
allow the gold dust to go to San Francisco.
He was very angry, very excited and wanted
his. own. way. I thought that If McKenzie's
army met Metson's army some one would set
killed."
After this picture of civilians, at war
over gold dust the proceedings took on a
colorless look and as Plllsbury and Ma
guire had 4 o'clock engagements the com
missioner adjourned the case. . -

Trial Jurors Receive Fees.
Five hundred trial jurors who hav?
served in Superior Court cases were mad'*
happy yesterday by receiving demands at
the rate of $2 per day from Auditor Wells
The total amount aggregated $3900, ani
jurors will now be paid in accordance
with a legislative act.
Recently the police have received com
plaints of windows being broken in the
vicinity of the restaurant, and it is
thought that the malicious work was
committed by the same person. The
smasher is described as nearly six feet
in height and of dark complexion. He
wears a long black beard.
Officer John Herlihey heard the noise
and rushed up Montgomery to Sacra
mento street. When the window smasher
saw the policeman he started to run, and
made his escape. Nearly all the windows
in the restaurant were demolished.
Thursday nia:ht pedestrians were at
tracted by the sound of breaking glass at
the corner of Leidesdorff and Sacramento
streets, and they saw a'' man' -hurling
cobble stones-through- store windows. The
lights in many of the buildings in that
neighborhood are protected. by Iron shut
ters, and when the miscreant tired of
casting stones against these he turned his
attention to a restaurant owned by Mar
tin Tovaraz.
A window smasher, who is believed to
be insane, is at work in the commercial
section of the city. His latest piece of
destruction was committed Thursday
night at 520 -Sacramento street. Ths
police have been unable to secure a clew
to his identity or a motive for his ma
liciousness. \u25a0 ' â¢ ' ~ -
Fred Belasco, one of the proprietors of
the Alcazar and Central theaters, and his
charming wife, who is known to theatri
cal goers as Juliet Crosby, returned from
the East yesterday. Mr. Belasco was-'
tired after his long journey and was
greatly distressed over the death of hU
most intimate friend, Mark Thall.
During his stay in the East he engaged
five sterling people for the two theaters.
Mifls Marion Convere, a sister of Lll.i
Convere, the Alcazar favorite, who mar
ried Francis Bruguiere, was engaged to
play leads at the Alcazar, and Miss Mar
garet Wycherly, another well known
actress, will be in the cast. He' also
secured a number of plays that have
scored heavily in the East and Europe.
In 1891 Mr. Thall joined Brady and
looked after the interests of Jim Corbett,
who had risen to fame by knocking out
John L. Sullivan. At the present time Mr.
Thall is managing "Yon Yonson" and "A
Stranger in a Strange Land." Although
he has been away from this city for many
years he has always maintained his resi
dence here.
Sam Thall enjoys the same popularity
in theatrical circles as did .his "late
brother. He has been in the business for
more than twenty-five years. He started
out with Robert McWade of "Rip Van
Winkle" fame, and had the unalloyed
pleasure of walking home from Ogden.
This was in 1S78. He next joined Josepii
Grismer and remained with that well
known actor for eight years. At that
time William A. Brady was property man
of the same show.
Sam Thall, the well known theatrical
manager and brother of the late Mark
Thall. will occupy the same position that
the latter held prior to his death. Ar
rangements were perfected last evening
and Mr. Thall' will immediately take up
the work of managing the Alcazar and
Central theaters. Mr. Thall came to this
city at the urgent request of Frederick
Belasco, one of the proprietors of the
two theaters, who wired Thall to meet
him in this city. The meeting was held
last evening at Belasco's residence. There
were present Mr. Belasco, M. E. Mayer,
H. H. Davis, the attorney for the theater
and the estate of Mark Thall, and Sam
Thall. The necessary papers were drawn
up and signed by all parties interested.
It was decided not to make any changes
in the personnel of the theaters. The In
terests of Mark Thall's children, Ella and
Charles, will Le looked after by their
uncle. He says he will take their lather's
place and see that their every want id
satisfied.

HOLDS MONTHLY MEETING
Judge Corcoran has awarded the entire
flow of .the, waters of Big Creek during
the summer and fall months, which is the
only time when the water is of value, to
the defendant and to the intervenor for
the purposes of irrigation and the flum
ing of lumber, which decision is n com
plete defeat for the plaintiff in , the
action. . _
The case was~~tried without a jury at
Mariposa, and the trial lasted many
weeks. For r the 'convenience of counsel
the argument was adjourned to San
Francisco, where the Judge occupied the
courtroom of Judge Kerrigan in thd
City Hall. The argument, which con
sumed six weeks, was the longest " ever
had in San Francisco. , Both sides sub
mitted every authority which was in any
way pertinent to the consideration of the
court, and hundreds of law books were
used during the argument.
Stratton & Kaufman, Charles N. Fox
and F. H," Short" represented the Madera
Sugar Pine Company, the'intervenor, and
Fox & Gray represented the Madera Ca
nal and "Irrigation Company, the defend
ant. John K. Hite was - represented by
Morrison & Cope, James F. Peck, J. A.
Adair and F. J. Castlehun. Over 12,000,
000 was involved in the litigation."
During the trial it was proved that the
Crocker-Huffman Land and Water Com
pany, an irrigation corporation which
supplies water to the residents of Mer
ced County, was paying all of the ex
penses of the action, and had a contract
with the plaintiff by which they were en
titled to all of the water which he might
recover by the litigation. This water,
which it was claimed might have been
used in irrigation in Merced County, will
now be. lost to the irrigatprs there, and
will be used as heretofore in irrigating
the orchards, vineyards and alfalfa fields
around Madera and in fluming lumber by
the Madera Sugar Pine Company.
John R. Hite, the millionaire mine
owner of Mariposa County, was defeated
yesterday in the Superior Court of Mari
posa County in an action brought by
him against the Madera Canal and Irri
gation Company,, with the Madera Sugar
Pine Company as. Jntervenor. The title
to' the waters of Big Creek, in Mariposa
and Madera counties, Was in question.
Thousands of acres of land in Madera
County are irrigated by the waters of
that â¢ creek. In addition, the Madera
Sugar Pine Company employs many hun
dreds of men in the lumbe'r industry,
at the mill, the box factory in Madera,
and in caring for the 60-mlle long Hume.
All of these are directly affected by the
decision, because the waters of Big Creek
are also used in the fluming of lumber to
Madera.
The Board of Public "Workg submlttd
yesterday to Mayor Phelan a statement
showing that a saving of $75,351 had been
effected during 1900-X901 in lighting .tho

statement also shows that the candle
power has greatly improved. The figures
as given follow: *

ADVERTISEMENTS.
AN INTERNAL REMEDY.
A Pleasant Tasting Tablet; Simple,
Convenient; Cures Every Form,
of Catarrh.
The use of Inhalers, douches, sprays,
salves and powders for catarrh is a nuis-
ance and inconvenience at the best, and
cannot compare with antiseptic remedies
In tablet form for Internal use.
Internal remedies are the only ones
which can really reach* the seat of the
disease, which is In the blood, and local ap-
plications can no more cure catarrh than
rheumatism or kidney trouble, the exces-
sive secretion in nose and throat being lo-
cal manifestations of a deep seated poison
In the blood.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, the most suc-
cessful of" the various Internal remedies
is composed principally of highly con-
centrated antiseptics, which destroy the
catarrh germs in the blood and cause
them to be eliminated through the natural
channels.
Progressive physicians use and advise
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets because they
contain no cocaine, no opiate, no enervat-
ing drug whatever, but are composed of
Guaiacol, Hydrastin, Red Gum and simi-
lar catarrh antiseptics, and are so safe
and pleasant that even littte children may
use them, with excellent results.
Catarrh sufferers who have wasted time
and money on local applications should
not despair of a radical cure Until a trial
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets has been
rnade. â¢ . ' \u25a0

serted by her husband, and with a child
of three years, she went to Los Angeles
last spring and secured a theatrical en

the Receiving Hospital.
Ruth de Barrette is her maiden name.
She was born* in France, and came as a
child to Louisville, Ky., where her parents
settled. She was educated in a convent.
When she first conceived the idea of going
on the stage her parents engaged her to
Despiro. and shortly after her four
teenth birthday she \u25a0was married. A child
was born, and the family moved to Col
orado, the husband settling In Cripple
Creek, where he engaged in the shoe busi
ness and prospered.
Her married life was not a happy one.
Her husband was fourteen years the sen
ior of his child wife. He was close and

physician in attendance learned her story
of starvation every assistance was ren

surviving principal. A message brings tbej

Four months aeo Benjamin "Weisenber- j
ser located a claim on land near the I
ranch of Thomas Watson, an old rancher, j
"Watson warned the miner not to use the :
\u25a0water from a certain spring. A quarrel
led to the procuring of guns and Weisen- !
beryer shot WatEpn dead. Witnesses saw!
the affair from a distance. Their stories
conflicted somewhat, and Weisenberger

SOFIA, Oct. 25.â It is semi-officially as
serted that no indication has yet been
*ound of Miss Stone's kidnapers having
been m Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Govern
ment is determined to annihilate the band
ehould it cross the frontier, and will deal
with the utmost severity with any Bul
garians whose complicity in the kidnap
\u25a0ing- shall be proved. Grwt resentment is
ff.lt here at tfte exploitation to the ais

In another state.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 2o.-Com
rrunication has been established from
2Â£elnik, province of Salonica, with the
brigands who abducted Miss Ellen M.
Stone, the American missionary; and her
companion, Madame Tsilka. Peet and
Eddy had a Ions conference to-day on
the various phases of the Stone affair,
based en dispatches received from Meinik.
TJit Cabinet approved the policy hither
to pursued by Secretary Hay. of first
usinp every means to effect the woman's
liberation, and when this is accomplished,
o: ", tÂ»sr death established, ihen to exact
rim reparation from Bulgaria. The Ameri
can ag-ents.ln Constantinople and. Sofia
are acting under these instructions. D -k
itison. the Consul General at Sofia, has
not improved the chances of Miss Stone's
recovery, according to administration of
ficials, by bis criticism of the Bulgarian
Government. Bulgarians are said to re
sent the published statements reflecting
upon them. The State Department has
CDnsicit T'-.i Dickinson's case, and it would
not be surprising- should Secretary Hay
take action.
The Cabinet was informed that ttC.OOO
\'^i. Vf? raised in Miss Stone's behalf and
i.ia.. this is subject to Mr. Eddy's
itlf opinion of the Cabinet was unÂ«iui
\u25a0nous that the executive without Congres
ecnal authorization has no right to add
a dollar of public money to the fund. The
a<'Uon ir_ Miss Stone's behalf establishes a.
tuui precedent, in that, as one of the of
uaais expressed it, it places a premium
o:i Â« uch offences, and under ordinary cir
cumstances the United States would not
irnerfere.
CALL BUREAU, K06 G STREET V
W.. WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.-Two ' im
portant dispatches regarding Miss Stone
were received by the State Department
io-day and considered by the Cabinet.
1 bcae dispatches established conclusively
that there Is absolutely no trace of the
k dnaped woman. Communication with
the brigaads has been interrupted and
tte*Â»la apparently no wsty of restoring it.
The initiative must come from the ab
djctors Even If the full amount of the
nmÂ«aa demanded by the brigands were
available the authorities say it would now
br impossible to pay it. &o dense is- the
mystery in which the woman and her
caters ara enveloped.

ROSY COLOR.
Produced by Postum Food Coffee.
"When a person rises from each meal
with a ringing in the ears and a general
sense of nervousness. It is a common habit
to charge It to a deranged stomach. .
"I found It was caused from drinking
ccfree, which I never suspected for a long
tiire, but found by leaving: off coffee that
the disagreeable feelings went away.
"I was brought to think of the subject
by getting some Postum Food Coffee, and
this brought me out of trouble.
"It Is a moat appetizing and Invigorat-
ing beverage and has been of such great
benefit to me that I naturally speak of it
from time to time as opportunity offers.
"A lady friend complained to me that
f he had tried Postum, but it did not taste
grocd. In reply to my Question she said
she guessed she boiled it about ten min-
utes. I advised her to follow directions
ant know that she boiled It fifteen or
twenty minutes, and she would have
something- worth talking; about. A. short
time ago I heard one of her children say
that they were drinking Postum nowa-
days, Â»o I Judge she succeeded in making
it (rood, which is by no means a difficult
tafk.
'Tom O'Brien, the son of a friend who
lives on Bridge street, was formerly a

Letter from Mrs. Wright, President of Brooklyn,
N.Y., Round Table, Proves this Claim.
A great many women suffer witha form of indigestion or dyspepsia which
does not seem to yield to ordinary medical treatment. While the symptoms
seem to be similar to those of ordinary indigestion, yet the medicines uniTers-
"ally prescribed do not. seem to restore the patient's normal condition. .' !
Mrs. Pinkham claims that there is a kind of dyspepsia that is caused by
derangement of the female organism, and which while it causes disturbances
similar to ordinary indigestion cannot be relieved without a medicine .which
not only acts as . a stomach tonic, but has peculiar utero- tonic effects as
well ; in other words, a derangement of the female organs may have such a
disturbing effect upon a woman's whole system as to cause serious indiges-
tion and dyspepsia, and it cannot be relieved without curing the original
cause of the trouble, which seems to find its source in tlÂ»e pelvic organs. :
As proof of this theory we be? to call attention to the letter from Mrs.
/Wright, of Brooklyn, N. Y., herewith published :
MRS. MAGGIE WRIGHT.
" Deae Mrs. Pixkiiam : â For two years I suffered more or less with
dyspepsia which so degenerated my entire system that I .was unfit; to
properly attend to my daily duties. I felt weak and nervous and noth-
ing I ate tasted good and felt like a stone in my stomach. I tried sev-
eral dyspepsia cures, but nothing seemed to help me permanently. I
decided to give Lydia fe. Pinkhain's Vegetable Compound a trial, and
was happily surprised to find that it acted like a fine tonic, and in a few
days I began to enjoy and properly digest my food. My recovery was
rapid, and in five weeks I was a different woman. Seven bottles com-
pletely cured me, and a dozen or more of my friends have used it since."
â Mks. Maggie Wright, 12 Van Voorhis St., Brooklyn, N. Y.
How a Serious Tumor Case Was Cured.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â Some time ago I wrote you that my regular
physician had made an examination and told me I was afflicted with a tumor
m my womb. I had backache, headache, bearing down pains and v*ry pro-
fuse menstruation. My limbs would ache so I could not s\eep and I was very
weak and nervous. I was bloated from my head to mv feet. After receiving
your letter I took Lydia K. Pinkhain's Vegetable Compound ana
Blood Purifier, and followed all the rest of your advice as near as I could,
and the tumor was expelled in pieces, and I regained my natural size. I con-
tinued taking your . Vegetable Compound for a while longer and felt like S
new woman. I cannot thank you enough for your kind advice and what your
medicine did for me. It certainly saved my life." â Mrs. Pebley S. Wnxis,
Vershire, Vt. (March 11, 1901.)
It wonld seem by tbese statements tbat women would save time
and much sickness if they would write to Mrs. Pinkham for ad-
vice as soon as any incipient illness appears. Her advice is free*
and has put thousands of women on the right road to recovery.

"^^ ONSIDERABLE [ discussion is go

followers of the sport. -â¢\u25a0,-.-â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢â¢..
The plan is to run as an. annual; semi
annual or monthly event a stake of twen
ty-four or forty-eight ; entries in heats;
that is, instead of a winner being declared
at the end of a course it will be necessary
for the hound to have -to its. credit the
best two in three or three- in five before
retiring its opponent.- ? : . ' : ~~
The idea of such, a meeting originated
with Judge John Grace arid was success
fully tried at Ingleside. Coursing Park In
1KS8 In that trial Koolawri was the win
ner' and Connell Bros.' , Log Boy the run
ner up. The affair created favorable com
ment at the' time and -would have become
a fixed event :in< coursing but for the fact
that dissension developed in the ranks of
the leashmen. This resulted in the open
ing of Union Park. More pressing matters
occupied the promoters of - the sport and
crowded the idea of the new stake ; from
thelr.mind8.i < '
"With the plains meeting but a few
weeks off the novel idea will be hailed with
delight by the owners of "long-distance"
coursers. If the stake is \u25a0 run before the
country trip it will put the dogs, in trim
for the fields and if decided after the open
meeting the entries that. have had experi
ence on the plains, will be .likely, candi
dates for honors > in such, a hard stake.

is, the feeding of strong food -to the

, The San Francisco Golf Club will open
the winter season this afternoon at the
Presidio links with a tournament over
eighteen holes. The gross scores will
count as the Â« qualif ying round for the
council's cup competition, the eight low
est scorers to qualify. The net. scores,
after the handicaps have. been deducted,
will count for the handicap match tourna
ment which begins to-day. After the play
ers have qualified the matches will be
played off, each contestant receiving
three-quarters of the number of strokes
that made his handicap in the qualifying
rounds;- the handicap being applied at cer
tain holes in accoradnce with the scheme
of handicapping adopted by the tourna
ment committee. A player who receives a
handicap of one stroke has an extra
stroke on the ninth hole. One who re
ceives- two â¢ has an extra stroke on the
ninth and eighteenth holes and so on. \u25a0
j All the local courses are in a hard con
dition " and nothing can be done, to im
prove them until after the first heavy
rains. Though the Sausalito course was
formally opened last Saturday, it is not
yet in proper condition for play, the first
and third holes not being in playable or
der. The new clubhouse will be a great
comfort and convenience to the golfers,
who have hitherto had no shelter from
the winds and storms which sometimes
sweep down the canyon around which the
course is laid. Miss Ruth Miller was
lucky.last Saturday in winning the ladles'
prizes for driving and putting after ty
ing, for. the driving- -contest, with Mrs.
Mason and for the putting . contest with
Mrs. Mason and Mrs.. Mays. Her victor

BE TESTED
SERKELEY, Oct. 25.â All work on
th'e \ University of California
gridiron centers around the
training of the big eleven, now
that the freshman game is over and th-.Â»
majority of the squad dismissed from
practice. As the result of last week's
rest while the coaches were giving the
freshmen their final instructions, the var
sity men have played faster ball than ever
before. There has been a snap to their
work in spite of days of hot weather.
This has been most encouraging to both
coaches and men. \u25a0 .
The number of men on the squad has
been decreased considerably, both from
the freshman and upper class lists. Only
those who are promising candidates for
the first eleven or are first-class secord
eleven players are kept on the field. Tho
strength of the second team has been
added to materially, by placing several
freshmen in its line-up, and from these
acquisitions are varsity possibilities.
Much practice is being done in the na
ture of individual work and among two
or more men where exact unison of move
ment is necessary for effective Playing.
Overall, the big feuard, and Quarterback
Johnny More, who will punt for Califor
nia in the intercollegiate contest, are per

the two and his punting is Improving _ in

San Kjranciscos and Corinthians took the
closing joint cruise of the year last' Sun- :
day. more than forty .boats being under
way.- While there was a good breeze- in
the channel, elsewhere the wind was
light, so that Commodore H. D; Hawks,
v/ho led the fleet in his sloop May, did
not go over as far as Sausahto, as had
been intended, but cruised about between
Belvedere Point and Lime Point. A thick
fog hung over the city during the greater
part of. the day, bo that the parade of the
yachts along the San Francisco water
front was abandoned. The fleet presented
a pretty sight as it came out from Tibu
ron Cove toward Sausalito, and later when
theyachts were lost to view in the fog or
came suddenly out into a bright space. On
returning to their moorings many '\u25a0 of ; the
yachtsmen stripped the sails from their
boats. Other yachts will be dismantled.to

pigskin for Overall. The work of the tr)o
has been generally successful, although
Gendotti has a fatal habit of passing the
ball too high. This makes More reacn
for the ball and delays his placing so
long that a block results. *
More is playing in reliable fashion at
quarter. Hudson has played at left end,
his position on last year's varsity eleven,
during recent practice, changing from
quarter, his original place this seasor..
He may go back and oppose More for
varsity honors.' Captain Womble has
shifted from right half back to his old
position at right end. How long he may
stay is a question, as Womble back of the
line, like Womble on the line, is hard* to
beat. Mini and Whipple are playing
halves for the most part, and Dudijn ful..
This week's practice has shown up th-i
men favorably. Albertson is playing
strong at tacklo, and Stowe and Braly, at
guard and tackle, respectively/ play
steady games. - . . "
Coaches Simpson and Hopper are devot
ing a great deal of their time in working
up interference among the players. They
are getting them to run well together and
are thus increasing the offensive powar
of the team. The defensive work con
tinues stronger than the offensive.
The following freshmen are continuing
practice on the squad: Slroud, Heitmul

The course between Beacon and Rector,
which will be run at Union Coursing Park
to-morrow as the final of the John Grace

have been faithfully prepared for the go
and a close score is looked for. -Beacon
will be the favorite and will probably lead
his younger opponent to the hare. Rector,
his backjers claim, will outpoint the great
blue dog in the. work and take the flag.
That the course will be fast and exciting
no. follower .of the game doubts.'...., : i ..
The Reliance Athletic Club team will
play -the big eleven on the campus to
morrow. This, date was originally sched
uled for the game with" the University of
Oregon, but the latter declined the issue,
deciding not to send down a team. â¢ .. x
Dole at tackle, Preston. Kuhn and Sefton
at ends and Fullback Kennedy have been
starring for the second. The addition of
several*. of the freshmen players to the
second squad has strengthened ,it consid
erably. "Young" Dole, Wilbur and Sefton
of the '05 class are in the fight for the
vacancy at left end on the big eleven.
Boren, fullback on the '99 team, is on the
field again after an absence of three
weeks, due to a disabled knee. He and
Clark, '04, are also candidates for end po
sUion and they, with the freshmen men
tioned above, are making the hardest
fight on the field centered around the
end's positions. At center Lee, former
varsity center, and Hauverman are put
ting up a pretty struggle, with little to
choose between them. Back of the line
things are lively. In the fight for half
back positions Hill and Fisher seem to
have the lead. Hill's punting will certain
ly secure him his position. "Bill" Traeger
continues his place kicklng>and if the big
fellow kicks as well on November 9 as he
does in practice the cardinal rooters will
have a chance to cheer "Fluffy" even
more vigorously than they did last
Thanksgiving day. Raitt's playing of the
quarter's position cannot be improved on.
His presence behind the line holds \u25a0 the
team together In a way that no other man
in the squad can hold it." -
â¢Coach FIckert is satisfied with every
thing except the speed, and the lack of
that, he says, is due to the treacherous
condition of the field. The "grid" has
been so hard and the injuries resulting
from falling on it so frequent that the
men are afraid to play fast ball. The field
has not been in -shape for weeks and as
a result nearly every man . on the team
has sustained slight injuries, for the most
part sprained ankles, wrenched knees and
muscle bruises. Kenneth Cooper of last
year's team is out of the game for the
present with- a badiy. sprained ankle. It
is hoped he will be out in canvas again
soon, as he is undoubtedly the best end
on the squad. Trainer Moulton remarked
to-day that' the physical condition of the
players was as good as he could wish for,
excepting the bruises Incidental to falling
on the clods and hard ground.
The second eleven haye been putting up
an article of football that some members
of. the. big -eleven would do well to imi
tate. During the practices this week the
second team has been playing star ball,
making the big eleven fight for every inch
of. ground, i. Roosevelt at guard, "Guiby"

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct.
25.â With but two weeks inter
vening before 'the intercollegiate
..game and but eight days more
of actual hard practice, exclusive of
games, the Stanford football eleven is not
showing the speed the men should have
developed at this stage of the season.
COLLEGE COACHES ARE JEALOUSLY WATCHING
PHYSICAL CONDITION OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS
The members of the tournament com
mitee are in favor, of having a continuous
tournament again.' There have been two
events of this kind in the past and while
they are popular at first they are short
lived. This is not a good time of the
year for a continuous tournament, as
there is a tournament scheduled for every
other Sunday. Affairs of this kind would
be more successful in the summer months.
There will probably be a class singles
tournament on the park courts to-morrow.
An event of this kind "would prove inter
esting, as the players are evenly matched.
Routh and Dunlap, the park champions
in doubles, have challenged Collier and
Crowell of the California Club to a match
to be. played on the park courts. The
park experts are anxious ' to have the
match played to-morrow, but Collier and
Crowell are not in favor of this. It will
probably be played next Sunday.
By winning the third class without lcs
ing a set Charles Kuehn showed he 13
easily the best man in that class. Kuehn
did not take to the game readily at first,
but of late has shown improvement. He
will probably remain in the same class for
the present.
The fourth class, composed of the new
members of the club, was won easily by
G. N. Armsby. He won his matches in
straight sets, none of which were deuce
sets. This was Armsby's first tournament.
He will hereafter play in the third class.
The five class winners will play off to
morrow for first honors. The drawing
and handicaps are as follows: Brown,
first class, a bye; R. N. Whitney, cham
pionship class, will allow Armsby, fourth,
class, odds of "half forty"; Strlngham.
second class, will allow Kuehn. third
class, odds of "fifteen."
As was expected Frank Strlngham went
through the second class with little diffi
culty. Cornell was considered to have an
even chance with him, but was badiy
beaten through lack of practice. Strins
ham, who formerly represented the Uni
versity of California, has been improving
rapidly since he took yp the game and
will probably be near the head of the first
class In a few months.
THE class singles tournament held
last Sunday on the courts of the
California Tennis Club was the
largest that club has ever held. The en
try list, thirty-four players in all. was
fully twice as large as usual and tho
matches were nearly all close.
The one match in the championship
class was a disappointment, as George
Whitney withdrew after the second set
and the match went to hi3 brother at set
all.
' Fred Brown, the University of Califor
nia crack, who carried off first-class
honors, played a steady game throughout,
and his victory was a well-earned one.
Collier was a slight favorite, but Brown
was a trifle too strong for him and re
tired him In the 'final round.

THE prospects for a great season of
winter racing never looked brighter
than they do at present. The sta
bles at Oakland track are crowded to
overflowing with horses, and many more
stables will soon be on the way here from
Chicago and Xew York. The "boosters"
for the New Orleans game in the Eastern
country are claiming everything in sight
and knocking California, as usual, but a
comparison of the two winter racing cen
ters is about as striking as Is the intellect
cf a South African gorilla pitted against
ihe brain of a college professor.
Last season Charley Ellison won in the
neighborhood of $50,000 out here, but be
cause Tommy Burns, the jockey, could
not swell it to suit his own peculiar tastes
and departed in a fit of the sulks, Ellison
will not pay us a visit this year. Burns
reflects no credit on the sport, and with
Spencer, Builman, Nash Turner, O'Con
nor, Cochran, "Wonderly, Redfern,
Mounce, Ransch, MeCue, possibly Shaw
and boys of that caliber, the irrepressible
and uncertain Tommy will not be missed.
Sam Hildreth will winter the pick of his
stable at Memphis and race the poorer
ones at Xew Orleans, 'tis said. Still, it is
barely possible California can bear with
this great misfortune, for others and big
ger stables will be out to replace the va
cancy.
Anent the oponing handicap, the stellar
attraction for Saturday, Xovember 2, such
a superb lot of entries were never before
received for this event. Beyond question
Watercure, from the stable of Green Mor
ris, will be allotted top weight. The son
of Watercress Is a very "classy" fellow
and ought to play leads in all of the
swagger events throughout the season.
Then there are Favonius, Nones, Gray
feld. La Goleta, Articulate, Autolight. Sir
Hampton, Rey Dare, Hard Knot, Eeau
Ormonde, The Fretter and other good
ones to furnish brain food for Handicap
per Brocks. It will insure a field fit 1.0
grace an opening "day on any of the big
metropolitan tracks.
The long-range prognosticators are fig
uring on fourteen or lifteen books cutting
in the first day at Oakland. There will be
tho two field books of Rainey & Driscoll
and the combination book of \V. J. Lang
ford to start with. It is reasonably cer
tain that Caesar Young, Joe Rose, Jim
Davis, Joe Harlan, Paul Ridley, Johnny
Coleman, Hughey Jones, Jack Atkins,
Herman Hoffman and Barney Schreiber
.will toe the mark, with several new firms
to be heard from. Mere than likely Billy

There was a bad break yesterday over
the spot where Atch Rock used to rear its
peak. The work of blowing â¢ up. the
"menace to navigation" has not proved
to be the success expected, and instead of
a thirty foot depth at.low water there is
not eight feet in some parts. The'dredger
now employed by the contractors does not
seem to make any appreciable impression
and almost every time the bucket comes
up empty. â¢ /
Yesterday, a heavy swell rolled in
through the Golden Gate, and in conse
quence the location of Arch Rock looked
somewhat like the Potato Patch after a
southwester. During â¢ the coming winter
the rock will have to be buoyed, or else it
will be a worse -menace to navigation than
it was in the early days of the port.

Her. Days Are Ended.
The old steamship Professor Morse, that
came here from the East during the Klon
dike rush and was condemned, is now be
ing broken up in Oakland Creek. She was
at one time known as the Aline, and ran
in the Mediterranean trade. Then she be
came the Suffolk, and ran between Eng
land and New York. She was cast away
on the coast of Newfoundland during a
gale, and was later salved by an Ameri
can company, which fixed her up and
placed her under the American flag as the
Professor Morse. For years she ran be
tween New York and New Orleans, and
then was sent to San Francisco via the
Straits of Mag-ellan. After many vicissi
tudes, she finally reached here, only to
be condemned by the local inspectors. 1< .
M. Smith, the borax king, bought her ana
is now breaking her up for old Junk. .
Two 'Ships Make Port.
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
German ship Chrlstel, 136 days from
Bremen, and the British ship Largiemore,
120 days from Bremen. The Christel was
formerly the British ship Old Kensington,
and is making her first run to this port
under her new name. On September 19
she was caught in a" heavy gale, and
everything movable on deck was washed
overboard. John Birs, the carpenter, was
attending to â¢ eome work on the fore
castle head when a big sea caught him in
its rush, and he went with it over- the
rail. The ship was hove to and a boat
lowered, but no trace of the missing man
could be found.
A few days before the fatality the Chris
tel spoke the German ship Marie, from
Caleta Buena, 'bound for Hamburg. The
Christel brings a cargo mainly composed
of hyposulphite of soda, cement, tar, coke
and 759 barrels of whisky.
The Largiemore had an uneventful voy
age from Antwerp. She encountered heavy
weather off the Horn, but there were no
accidents. On September 1 she spoke the
French bark Amlral de Cornuller, from
Liverpool, bound for Portland, in latitude
58 degrees south, .longitude 78 degrees

FOOTBALL TEAMS
ON THE GRIDIRON
The University of California and Olym
pic Club football elevens will meet this
afternoon^ at 3 o'clock on the Sixteenth
and Folsbm street grounds for their sec
ond game. In the previous contest the
Olympics were defeated by a score of 5-0,
through a place kick by Overall.
Stow, California's left guard, is out of
the game temporarily on account of ill
ness and will probably not be able to
take part. Either O'Toole or Hendricks
will take his place. Starr and DIbblee,
ends, are suffering from slight injuries.
Womble will play right end and Hudson
left. The teams will line up as follows:

Comment was caused at Berkeley yes
terday by the appearance in a university
publication of a communication from As
sistant Coach James Hopper severely cen
suring the freshmen for not returning to
the grridiron to play against the varsity.
He says:
With the big game only two weeks off, at
this critical period when all energies should b*
directed to the finishing into perfect shape
of the varsity, a certain class of men are
deserting the Held and leaving us terribly han
dicapped. Every night this week it has been
only with the greatest dlf/lculty that we have
been able to gather a gecend eleven. It has
been only through the devotion of certain loyal
men, who have kept at work in spite of in
juries, that practice has been possible. At this
Etage of the season such a condition of affairs
is indeed deplorable. I can go back in my
mind feven years without finding a parallel
to It, and if it does not speedily change, I
predict loudly that we will drift Inevitably to
a shameful defeat.
The action of the freshmen in quitting, with
but few exceptions, is incomprehensible. 1
doubt if the college was satisfied with the re
sults of the freshman game. The coaches cer
tainly were not. But the freshmen seem ab
solutely so. They strut about with inflated
chests and serene smiles as if they were the
heroes of eome great victory. Out of twenty
five freEhmen asked to come out for the rest
of the sevjsori five have reported. It lies with
the football men of the college, and especlally
the freshmen, to give us victory or defeat. 1
hope that they will rise and do their duty.
THE San Franeiscos marched off the
field at Recreation Park yesterday
whistling softly "He certainly was
good to us." This had reference to Um
pire Hr.rper, who had again given the. un
fortunate Oakland team a little the worst
of it in some of his decisions.' The game
went seven Innings, the Wasps winning
by a score of 9 to 5.
For four innings Oakland played a sharp
fielding game and secured two runs. With
ordinary headwork they could have in
creased their runs considerably. In the
fifth they went to pieces, and the Wasps
scored four runs en six hits. Pabst was
the first man up, and sent a two-bagger
which bumped the lef tfield fence. Krug
f ollcwed with a home run over the center
field fence.
Shay hit safe, but was caught stealing
second. RelUy.was out at second. Iburg
was next at bat, and marked the turning
point in the game. Hodson let down In
his pitching, and instead of striking out
Iburg, as he was apparently capable of
doing, he gave him a pass to first. Iburjj
etole second and third, and scored on Nor
dyke s .tiigh bounding hit over stortstop.
Wilson and Hildebrand hit safely, scoring
>.ordykiÂ».
The ball was thrown home, and Lohman
tagged Mordyke out. Harper called him
"out," and then running up found Loh
man had meanwhile dropped -the ball. The
umpire changed his decision and called the
runner "safe." The spectators hissed Har
per. The latter found it necessary to have
Dunleavy of Oakland led off the field by a
special policeman. Lohman was also put
out cf the game.
Francks, who relieved Dunleavy at
third, nissed a ball thrown him by the
pitcher, letting in two runs. Hildebrand
scored Xordyke and Reilly on a two-bag
ger, ani Krug scored Pabst, who had
made a safe two-cushjen shot. The five
runs were made on two hits. The score;

Harrison's circular says: "During the wee!c
there have been three coal deliveries from
Washington. 10.GC0 tons; two from British Col
umbia. 4650 tons; one from Oregon, 420 tons;
one from Swansea, 3100 tons; two from Aus
tralia. 5570 tons; total, 23,740 tons. This is a
smaller amount than our average requirements
call for, but for the moment there are no
complaints being made by consumers that their
orders are not being filled. Some recent char
ters have been made for steamers to carry
our coast products to this market; these com
bined with our regular carriers will keep the
market here fully maintained with fuel.- Th-i
chartered list of coal carriers from Australia
now foots up thirty-seven vessels, with a carry
ing capacity of nearly 100,000 tens. A number
of these vessels will not reach here this year.
There may be somewhat of a scarcity of fuel
this winter for domestic uses, still. If consum
ers cannot sret grades they have been hereto
fore accustomed to burn they will be forced to
utilize other substitutes. This shortage will
be brought about by the accident occurring to
the Wellington colliery In British Columbia.
Fuel oil Is being freely shipped, and Is meet-
Ing with ready sales at better prices than hava
been ruling for several months past. All klniia
of methods are being tried with a view to the
introduction of oil for cooking and house-heat
ing purposes. So far they have been a com
parative failure. It Is hard to overcome the
noxious smell and smoke."

Wholesale and jobbing trade generally is
characterized as fair to moderate the country
over. A fair reorder business Is noted in the
Northwest, but trade generally is waiting the
movement of goods from retailers' hands. Col
lections are . generally good, except at the
South, where the slower movement of cotton
has tended to retard business. As for some
weeks past, the iron and steel trade returns the
best reports, and these reports are being pro-t
longed to an extent which has rarely been wit
nessed. The. largest steel rail - order of the
year was placed this week. In all 160,000 tons
being taken at the ruling rate of $23 per ton
by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and
some other large orders from other companies
are now under negotiations. In all 1 500 000
tons for 1902 delivery have been booked. Spe
cial activity Is noted in structural material at
Plttsburg and there have been additional or
ders for implement manufacturers, with con
tinued activity in tin plates and steel, sheets
mills producing the latter being months be- '
hind on orders. . i
The large crop of wheat and the admitted
Increase in. the world's supplies have heretov
fore been balanced by the knowledge that the
rest of the world's food supplies are shorter
than last year.
Prices this week have been pushed over the
"dead center" by reports of drought in Argen
tine reducing yields from 25 â¢ per cent to 40
per cent. Exporters have bought on reactions.
Flour has strengthened with wheat' and pro
duction is heavy, the Minneapolis mills last
week breaking all records. . Hog products are
lower, the feeling growing that the higher
prices of the late boom have checked consump
tion. Statistically the situation is, however
still bearish. . " \u25a0
Despite the- smaller movement of grain, and,
up, to this week, the lighter movement ot cot
ton, so heavy is the volume of business offered
the railroads of the country that complaints
of car shortage come from all parts of the
country, notably for Iron ore and steel, lumber^
grain and coal. In the coal trade the shortage
is marked, because the anthracite tonnage is
heavy, being estimated at $55,000,000, or one
fifth larger than a year ago.
NEW YORK. Oct. 25.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
KETV YORK. Oct. 25.â The bulls had hard
\u25a0work to sustain the market to-day and the
efforts to continue the advance were frustrated
by the realizing encountered. The coalers con
tinued to Tnoive upward this morning and there
\u25a0was a revival of thÂ» bull movement in St.
Paul, but the heavy realizing which had been
in progress during the week under cover of the
new points of strength has aroused suspicion
that the whoie movement was manipulative
and designed to unload Â«ocks. A number of
special weak points added to the difficulties
of the bulls and the money and exchange situa
tion showed the necessity of caution for those
depending on call loans. The whole market
turned heavy before the dosing and -was In
that condition at the - last. The day's net
changes were reduced mostly to insignificant
proportions. St. Paul rose at cne time 3 points
but its gain is only 1%. People's Gas fe!l an
extreme 2% on the continued selling induced
by the franchise tax decision of the Illinois
Supreme Court allowing taxation on the mar
ket valuation. The ttock received inside sup
port and responded to the argument offered
by its supporters that increased appraisenr-nt
\u25a0would be likely to lower the tax rate The
stock's net loss was only *i. The New York
money Flocks declined sharply, apparently with
the. Chicago stocks, declining from 1 to Z%
Amalgamated Copper was rather dull but
ruled belov.- Ispt nipht's price in spite of the
firmer market for raw copper in London ThÂ»
coalers had little left to show as g&ins ar the
cloee of the day and the conditions In the gen
eral list are very irregular. Another jump in
toreigik exchange had a disturbing effect on
eentlment. as rates are now brought to a level
near to the gold export point for Berlin and
Paris. Exchange experts affirm that no loss
would occur on shipment at to-day's rate It
is obvious also that the requirements of those
centers are not yet satisfied. Paris took an
other $l,CCfl.0O0 from London and sterling at
Berlin fell again. The London discount r->te
wa* pulled up to near the bank rate which
â¢would give an opportunity for an advance in
the bank rate to be effective in restraining the
outgo of cold. Conditions thus promise addi
tional pressure on New York. The wheat ex
rorts for this week are considerably below those
for last week, thus lessening the volume of
exchange. The preliminary statement of the
cash movement by the banks foreshadows a
weak bank statement to-morrow. In spite o*
the payments by the sub-treasury on account
cf the gold deposited at Pacific Coast points
amounting to $2.320,OCO, that institution has
taken from the banks a net balance of $1 648 -
*T*. The net Iofs to the interior on the direct
express movement is estimated at less than
tl.COO.OOfi. including a shipment of nearly $2.0C0,
000 to Philadelphia on account of the payment
by thÂ» Pocahontas Coal Company for the Flat
Top Coal Company. The condition in the loan
item is problematical.
Railroad bonds were less active in sympathy

inclined to react. Total sales, par value, $2,235,-

or the week was the placing of enormous orders

brisk movement on finished products and higher

that the domestic situation is not called to
stimulate export trade and the loss of much
foreign business may be directly attributed to
the strike, which put the mills sÂ» tar .behind
on home needs. Coke ovens are active and
the output is large, but lack of cars and motive
power restricts shipments. Coal deliveries are
similarly retarded, the dealers being often un

MANILA. Oct. 25. â The people of the
Island of Samar have been notified to
concentrate in the towns on pain of being
considered public enemies and outlaws
and treated accordingly. Intense feeling
exists among the troops in Samar. If
they can meet the enemy in the open
there will be great retaliation. Many of
them have seen and the others have
heard of the barbarous treatment to
which the dead American soldiers were
subjected by the Filipinos recently.
Francis de Jesus, Lukban's chief com
missary, was recently captured and taken
to, Cebu. Papers which he had in his
possession have resulted in the arrest of
many of the best-known residents and
civil officials of the, Island of Leyte.
It develops that Billran Island, nortk
of the- Island of Leyte, has been a hotbed
of insurrection. Every civil official there
has been aiding the insurgents of Samar
in -every way. They have landed several
cargoes of rice and have received hemp
in exchange. â¢ *
Several thousand dollars also fell into
the hands of the Americans when, De
Jesus was made prisoner. His capture is
thought to be a great disaster to the
revolutionary cause. .

counsel, John F. Douglas, Judge Cantrill.
Commonwealth's Attorney Franklin and
Hendrick, Williams and Golden, repre
senting the State, and four Deputy Sher
iffs.

the jury that the acts and declarations of
every conspirator indicted with Powers
were the acts and declarations of Powers,
and that if the bringing of the mountain
army to Frankfort was due to Powers
and if that act resulted in Goebel's death,
the prisoner should be found guilty. If
the jury believed Goebel's death resulted
from a conspiracy, even though the orig
inal intention of the conspirators was not
to kill Goebel and the defendant was ab
sent when the shooting occurred; the de
fendant should be found guilty. .
The instructions were strongly for con

The entertainment which was given last
right at Odd Fellows' Hall by the Retail
Grocers' Association proved a success. De
spite the threatening weather the hall wls
crowded. The programme proved an en
ttrtaining one and the large audience was
fully repaid for braving the elements. The
feature of the evening was the presenta
tion of a musical comedy farce, entitled
"Politics in a Grocery Store." by the Co
lumbia Minstrel Company. The farce was
accompanied by an interesting musical
programme.
The farce, with its many ludicrous and
perplexing situations, excited great merri
ment. All the characters were well up in
their parts. The plot represented life in a
grocery store, with all its possibilities for
mirth. There was the "real nice clerk"
with his glib tongue, the butter purveyor,
the inevitable messenger boy and a red
headed drummer. All contributed their
portion of action to the farce in such a
manner as best calculated to excite the
risibles of the audience. * *
The cast of characters was as follows:
William Smooth, who runs the store, George
K. Cheney: a red-headed drummer. "Billy"
(W. W.) Urackett: A. Perclval Uobbs, the real
nice clerk, Clarence M. Freed; Snowball, who
delivers the orders. Elton Lambert: Hi Ball, the
barkeep, Harry Turton; Tin Pickles, who

Srecial Dispatch to The Call.
For some weeks past my name has frequently
appeared in the San Francisco and Los Angeles
dally papers in conjunction with my reported
candidacy for tne Supreme bench, and while
many of these comments have been highly
complimentary and therefore pleasing to me,
others have been very annoying in that they
placed myself and others in a false position.
First of all I desire to* brand as absolutely
false any and all statements to the effect that
Governor Gage Colonel Burns, Mr. Herrin and
W E Dunn or any of them have ever offered
me a nomination, conditional on the delivery
by me of the San Bernardino delegation in the
next State convention, or that I ever promised
to deliver or said that I could deliver the votÂ«
ot this or any other county in said convention.
Furthermore. I desire to say here and now
that I am not, have not been and do not ex
pect to be a candidate for a Supreme Court
nomination in the ordinary acceptance ot the
term. In my opinion the dignity and character
of that court should lift It above the plane of
ordinary politics and preclude any one worthy
of a place thereon from aggressively seeking
such a nomination.
It is well known, in this county at least,
that A. G. Kendall, is a candidate for the
State Board of Kqualization, with every rea
sonable prospect of success. . Months ago, when
my name was first mentioned in connection
with the Supreme Court, I assured Mr. Ken
dall that I would not under any circumstances
antagonize him in his aspirations; that I recog
nized his prior claim to consideration; that I
was entirely willing to have a delegation from
this county selected in his interest, and that
in the event that I should hereafter by any
possibility become a candidate I should' still
concede him the first right to the support of
our home delegation, and If at any time my
candidacy should endanger his success I would
promptly withdraw my name from further con
sideration.
I am not aware that I have ever said or
done anything at variance with this declaration
. nnd I have no present desire or purpose to
do so.

HELENA. Mont., Oct. 25.â A lone, un
masked highwayman shortly, after 6
o clock this evening went into a Main
street saloon, held up the barkeeper and
six other men at the point of a revolver.
He then rifled the till of $30. and, securing
the money and other articles of value in
the possession of the visitors in the place
backed out. of the door and made his
escape, having met with no resistance
during the hold-up. Early this morning
a safe in a mercantile house in the same
vicinity was blown, open and $200 taken.
There is no clew to the criminals in
either case.
Daring Work of Robbers.
lo-night the fence was nearly com
pleted. People who drive to the depot
Â«ire greatly inconvenienced and the area
of the depot yard is diminished.
The lot in question has never been
fenced, and has long been used as a'
driveway to the depot. For years the
railroad company has been considering
its purchase, but it could never come to
an agreement with the owner regarding
the price.
For a few minutes Shearer and his men
stood their ground and refused to per
mit the posts to be disturbed. Threats
were exchanged and shovels and crow
bars were tightly grasped. Peacemakers,
however, brought about a compromise,
and one post that stood in the center of
the entrance was removed by Mayor
Morehead, who was watched by an ad
miring crowd as he labored at his unu
sual task.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 25.â Bloodshed was
narrowly averted to-day at the corner of
B street and the entrance to the nar
row gauge railroad depot in this city.
A. gang of men in the employ of George
D. Shearer, a local real estate, dealer,
was engaged In erecting a fence around
a lot at that corner. The posts had al
ready been set when the railroad, people
notified Superintendent'of Streets George
Richardson that a public, highway was
being obstructed. Richardson hurried to
the scene and ordered the posts removed.
Mayor Stanley P. Morehead and a band of
stalwarts arrived, about this time and re
newed the demand.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
At the same time Colombia's attitude
has satisfied the authorities that so far
as she is concerned she would be glad If
some definite arrangement can be made
under which the United States would ac
quire possession of the Panama conces
sion. It Is stated that the company has
not more than $2,000,000 with which to con
tinue the work of construction of the
canal, and that it will be unable to ob
tain an additional sum. The concession
of the company will expire In six years
and then the United States could assume
possession.
Hutin and Boeufve have not yet sub
mitted a proposal to the Isthmian Canal
Commission notwithstanding assertions
to the contrary. As Hutin went to Paris
for the special purpose of getting an esti
mate of the value of the work, It is bt
lieved that he has brought Ijack a memo
randum. He ha3 not presented It to thÂ«
Isthmian Canal Commission and ban
given no indication of his purpose to do.
so.
Rear Admiral Walker is becoming pro
voked over the delay. The commission
proposed to submit Its report to the Presi
dent between November 12 and Novem
ber 15. If Hutin has not submitted his
proposal then the commission will simply
have to repeat its recommendation for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal as it
did in its preliminary report.
It is believed by members of the com
mission that Hutin fears that the price
he believes the property worth Is so largo
that this Government will not pay It and
that consequently there will be no chance
of a purchase at a high figure.

W.. WASHINGTON. Oct. 25.â In order to
facilitate American control of the Pana
ma canal despite the procrastinating
methods pursued by M. Ilutin, represent
ing the French Canal Company. Colombia,
has proposed to the United States that it
assume her place in all matters relating
to the waterway. This proposal has not
been accepted by the administration, nor
can it be on account of the inability of
the executive to pledge the Government
to the adoption of one route or another in
advance of action by Congress.
Srecial Dispatch to The CaU.
KI Correo de Sonora and other papers
published in Guaymas consider the situa
tion serious and express fear that trouble
is not far away. The Government has
been appealed to by some of the leading
merchants to have the troops returned.
The boldness of the Indians In raiding
ranches near Guaymas causes aJarm
among the people of the bay city and
Indian scares are frequent there. The
warfare carried on by the Federal troops
against the Yaquis for six months em
bittered the Indians more than ever and
they have vowed to avenge the death of
Chief Tetabite. who was killed a few
months ago. When this leader was slain
â¢the "Mexicans believed the war was at an
end and the troops were withdrawn. It
Is now thought that another .leader has
sprung into prominence among the In
dians and is gathering corn and ammuni
tion in the Yaqui River Valley to sustain
them In a long fisht.
Many ranchers have left their homes
and gone to Guaymas and other large
settlements for protection.
On the first of the week Senora Dona
Celsa Pesquiera de Maytorena was en
route to Ortiz with two wagons laden with
corn and other products of her rancho.
Accompanying her were 1 a number of
peaceful Yaquls, who were employed on
the ranch, and Herculano Hernandez, her
ranch foreman. On the way a band of
Yaquis held them up and opened fire.
Hernandez and the woman were armed
and resisted. Hernandez was killed and
Senora Maytorena was compelled to yield.
She had considerable money with her,
\u25a0which she gave to the Indians to save
her life. They took her wagons laden with
provisions and . persuaded the peaceful
Yaquis to Join them.
Yaquis have been seen moving in bands
and wherever a rancho was attacked this
week there were always a number well
armed and desperate. It is believed that
a plan has been laid under a new chief
to attack settlements and ranches. At the
Bustamente rancho, where old man Bus
tamente was killed several months ago,
a large number of cattle were driven oft
by the Yaquis this week. Some of the
Yaqui cowboys employed at the ranch
were persuaded to leave and go with the
warriors.
TUCSON. Ariz.. Oct. 25.â Yaqul Indians
are again causing considerable excitement
in Sonora and the Government no doubt
will be called upon to return the troops
and take up the fight apain. Alberto
Robinson's cowboys a few days ago met
a band of Yaquis, who told them that they
were procuring ammunition and provis
ions for a fight with the Government and
for this reason the raids of the past week
had been made upon the ranches of La
Misa, Santa Maria and La.Purisima.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
There were, however, some circum
stances connected with the Nevada di
vorceâa question as to his deception of

In a less innocent light ,than he would
have had it. and the Lords made the pen
alty a very real one.
The law of England does not recognize
divorces of English citizens obtained in
foreign countries, so the Earl, protesting
that his violation of the law was inad

Court of the House of Lords that con

would consider him only technically guil
ty and Would pronounce a merely nominal
sentence â one hour's imprisonment, or
something of that sort.
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â Earl Russell,
whose Nevada divorce did not serve to

ment in, the Holloway Jail for bigamy* is
not to be allowed to land in this country

DEMAND BLOOD
OF THE BOLOMEN
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â Director Rob
erts of the Mint has prepared a statement
showing the production of the precious
metals for the' calendar t- year of .1900. It
shows that the production of gold in the
world that year was 12.457.2S7 .ounces, of
the value ot $257,514,700, a loss in value of
$49,070,200 from 1S99. The loss. was mainly
in the Transvaal field and due to the war.
The production of South Africa in 189D was
of the value of $73,277,100 and in 1900 $9,671,
000. The principal' gains, were $8,118,00.0 in
.the United States and $6,600,000 in Canada.
The United States again heads the list. In
the XJnited States the principal' gains were
by Alaska, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. "
The silver output of the world amounted i
to 178,796,796 fine ounces, the largest ever !
known. It exceeds the product of 1899 by
11,572,513 ounces. The United States again
leads all Â»ther producers, with a slight ex
cess over Mexico. There was an import
ant advance in the price of silver during
the year, the price ranging from 59.1 cents
per ounce in January to 66.3 cents in the
last month of the year. The chief factor
in t.he rise was the purchases for the ac
count of the Government of India.' Silver
rupees still constitute the common cur
rency of India and to supply the demand
the Government gives rupees in exchange
for gold sovereigns at the rate of fifteen
rupees to the sovereign. Under this policy
the Government reports an outlay for its
.fiscal year ended March 31.-1901. of Â£6,133.
000, which, at the, average value of the
year, would make the. purchases amount
to nearly 30,000,000 ounces. This would
seem to restore India to somewhere near
her old position as a customer for silver.
The production of gold in States and
Territories producing the largest amounts
is estimated by the director as follows:
Alaska $8,171,000
Arizona ,.... 4, 193,000
California , 15,816.200

Nevada 2.006,200
Oregon 1,694.700

With the signing of the Peking protocol
it wa's;"belieVed that it had 'determined tha
vexatious questions â¢ arising . out of thÂ©
Chinese revolt. -That protocol provide!
that China should . Issue bonds valued at
450,000.000 taels which should be distributed
among the powers in payment of their re
spective claims- for indemnity. .
Special Commissioner Kockhill has now
reported to the State Department the fact
that the aggregate of the claims of all
Governments is 462,500,000 taels. No other
European -nation is likely to scale its
claims \u25a0 without similar - action by other
Governments and , the - United States may
take the initiative by. proposing as it did
last spring to cut its claim In half. :
\u25a0 Should, this action be taken and other
nations follow Its example, then the ag
gregate would be less than the sum of
450,000,000 taels, bonds for which China has
already taken measures to hand over to
the dean. of the diplomatic corps at Pe
king. * - -. -, ..-.. ... ........
\u25a0 Apprehension is expressed that certain
nations, seeing "the reduction below \u25a0 the
limit accepted, will increase their claims.
In the interest of a prompt and satisfac
tory settlement- the authorities here are
becoming .Impressed with the advisabil'ty
of again putting, forth a proposition ' that
the claims; be -referred, to The Hague
Court of- Arbitration for settlement. %
Had action been taken last fall in. ac
cordance with the proposal of the United
States, or last spring, as persistently
urged by" "Mr.-*Rockhill,. -the indemnity,
question would be outof the way... Secre
tary Hay . and Â« Mr. Rockhlll . are . giving

bles of twelve years f standing have af
fected his heart, and Mr. Stan ton's physi

The dying capitalist is the father of ex-
Coroner James . Stanton, who died some
years ago. John Stanton. present Park
Commissioner, and William Stanton, the
well known chemist, are sons of the pio
neer. He is also the uncle of Dr. Joan
Gallwey and Dr. James Murphy, two of
the best known physicians in the city. â¢ \u25a0
Mr. Stanton -was foremost In the early
development of the city, being one of the
projectors of the plan to extend the Mis

belt was a suburban valley of the city
proper. .

SUSPICIOUS circumstances sur
rounding a big shipment of arms
and ammunition on the Chilean
steamer Loa, now lying in this
pert, led to prompt action, late
yesterday afternoon, by the United States
officials to prevent any possibility of the
warlike goods reaching the hands of Cen
tral â¢American insurgents. The cases con
tain 4000 Remington rifles and bayonets
and 2,500,000 ball cartridges.
The steamship Loa, of 3200 registered
tonnage, arrived in the harbor last Tues
day from Valparaiso and Central Ameri
can ports. The ship was docked at How
ard-street wharf. No. 3, and was sched-,
uled to sail this morning on her return
voyage to the south.
Yesterday afternoon, shortly before tha
close <5f official hours at the Custom
house, a manifest was presented to Sur
veyor of the Port Spear and his chief
deputy, Chauncey St. John, calling for the
shipment of : 450 cases of : rifles and 420
cases of cartridges on the steamship Loa.:
The manifest stated that Schwartz
Brothers, 421 Market street, were the
shippers of the goods, and that C. D.
Bunker & Co., 435 Battery street, were the
brokers for the shipment. .
The manifest also announced that the
munitions of war were â¢ to- be landed . at
Acajutia, Salvador, â¢ and that they were
for the "Gobiernio del Salvador." In
vestigations were at once instituted by
the surveyor and his " deputy,' and it was
learned that the big steamship was to sail
this morning, and that she was not to
carry a single passenger.
The possibility that the vessel might be
used later for filibustering was suggested
by the fact of the large. shipment of arms
and the announcement that no passengers
would be carried on the steamship.
Surveyor of the Port Spear, after con
sulting with his chief deputy, St. John,
sent a letter to Collector of the Port
Stratton, Viotlfying him of the facts In the
case... â¢â¢ ' -
Collector Stratton at once placed him-
JAMES STANTON ITEABS
THE END OF HIS LIFE
A thorough investigation of the whole
affair will be made to-day by United
States officials. - -
A dispatch received from New York last
night stated that Bloom Bros, were the
agents of - the Salvadorean Government
and had made a number of - shipments
of arms and ammunition to the republic.
A representative "of 'the firm stated that
he - could not identify the goods to be
shipped on the Loa from San Francisco
until he had an opportunity of consulting
the -books of the. firm.
The bills of lading filed at the Custom
house yesterday *by the brokers show that
the cases of rifles ' and cartridges came
ficm El Paso to this city, and were sup
posed to have been reshipped at El Paso
frcm some point in' Mexico.
The value of the arms and ammunition
loaded on the Loa yesterday is given at
$^5,000 in the manifest. One of the boxes
of rifles was partly opened yesterday and
revealed the contents to be Remington re
peating rifles of the latest pattern. J All
the cases are marked 'with the name of
tl-o Remington Arms Company of New
York. . â¢
Repeating Rifles in Cases.
Statements were made yesterday to Sur
veyor of the Port Spear that the reason
why the Loa would not carry passengers
was because the Inspectors. of Hulls and
Boilers required * some alterations to be
made at a cost of $1500 and the company
did not want to spend that amount.
To the Consul General j of Salvador the
same parties said that it would take
two weeks for thei ship to secure an Amer
ican register in order to carry passengers.
- "We only have some flour for Acajutla,"
said Peck, "and If there are any arms for
that place I know nothing, about It."
when told that the cases of rifles and
cartridges were even then being loaded on
the steamer Peck replied, "Where are
'they?" but declined to go forward and
make an inspection. "'
First Officer Daniel Peck and Second
Officer Thomas \u25a0\u25a0 Steer denied that any
arms were being taken on board the Loa
and said, that the list of the cargo had
been examined by them yesterday morn
ing. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢ ..-\u25a0-. . '\u25a0 " .
â¢ Captain D. Davies of the Loa and his
officers were very uncommunicative when
asked yesterday what they knew about
any arms or ammunition being shipped
to Acajutla, Salvador.
Captain Davies is a Welshman and his
officers are Englishmen and all professed
Ignorance of the shipment. The captain
was in a jovial mood, but when asked why
his fine ship would not carry passengers
he became angry and said: ; .v
"Because we don't want them on this
trip; that's why." .
When told that 1 his vessel might be de

Balfour, Guthrie & Co. act as agents for
the line and it was stated at their office
yesterday, that the steamship Loa would
not carry passengers from San Francisco,
as the vessel did not have time to secure
an American register, she being scheduled
to sail this morning.
Stohl informed the Consul General that
the shipment of arms was all legitimate,
A few minutes later, however, Bunker
accompanied Stohl, 'of-. the the firm of
Schwartz Brothers, to . the office of the
Consul General of Salvador.
A request for the name of- the agent or
a view of the alleged letter met with a
flat refusal from -Bunker. , * .
When the broker was informed that his
version of the shipment entirely dif
ferent to â¢ that made ! by a member of the
firm' of Schwartz Brothers, he excused
himself on the ground that he had* to
catch a ferry boat for Oakland.
C. D. Bunker, the Custom-house broker,
who figured In the shipment, was asked
what he knew about' the affair, and he
said:
- "About thirty days ago an agent of the
Salvadorean Government called on us
and said he was on his way to. Mexico to
purchase rifles and cartridges from the
Mexican Government. He informed us
that the Mexican Government had"adver
tised for some months in the New ;York
papers for a purchaser for a lot of old
Kemington rifles and cartridges."
"Did you see this agent again?" was
asked of Bunker.
"No, but we heard from him," replied
the broker; "he wrote to us from the City
of Mexico, saying that he had shipped the
goods and that we were to see that they
were placed on a steamship for Salvador."
"Have you that letter in your, posses
sion?" Bunker was asked. \
"Yes," he replied.
Broker Contradicts Shippers.
: "We are only acting for Bloom Broth
ers of New York, who are the agents in
New York for the Salvadorean Govern
ment," said Stohl. "We heard from Bloom
Brothers that they had purchased these
goods, and they asked us. to see that they
were shipped to Salvador. We really have
nothing to do with the matter. We asked
Bunker & Co., the brokers, â¢\u25a0 to act in the
affair for us. They will tell you all about
When asked if he hVd any objection to
showing the letter from Bloom Brothers
regarding the shipment of arms; Stohl re
plied that he would not show any letters,
and that the matter was "perfectly
right."
A member, of the firm of Schwartz
Brothers, who gave his, name. as. Stohl/
was asked yesterday afternoon what con
nection his firm had with: the shipment of
the arms and ammunition on the steam
ship Loa.
A significant feature of the case is that
statements made by a representative of
Schwartz Brothers and by Bunker, the
Custom-house' broker," are entirely differ
ent as to the party who purchased the
rifles and 'cartridges. .. i . ,
Consul General Mejia was surprised . to
hear that a shipment- of arms was to be
made from this port, presumably for his
government, s
"I know nothing about the matter what-;
ever,'" said the Consul General, "and 1
can throw no light on the affair. Since I
have been stationed here my. government
has always informed me of any such
transaction. Some weeks ag'o the largo'
arsenal in my countrj* was destroyed by,
nre, and I know that the rifles and car
tridges were to be replaced. Our Minister
at Washington would surely know of any
shipment through this port of munitions
of war to ; Salvador, and , would keep me
posted. . I shall telegraph at once to him,
and will also cable to my President in
Salvador."

Storekeepers' Cash Registers Are Be
ing Robbed in a Systematic
Way.
Thomas J. Corey, bartender for J. P.
Dwyer, Seventh and Harrison streets, re
ported to the police yesterday that on
Thursday morning a man called at the
saloon and asked for the key of a vacant
house next door that he might inspect thi
premises. He got the key, but returned
in a few minutes, explaining that he
could not open the front door. Corey
went with him and easily succeeded in
opening the door. Corey chatted with th2
man for a minute or two and returned
to the saloon. He found the cash register
open and $2S 70 gone. He ran to the
vacant house, but the man had disap
peared.
The police are satisfied that two crooks
are in the city working the same trick
that has been successfully played before.
They believe the same man. with a con
federate, robbed the cash register in the
branch store of the American Tea Com
panv oti Hayes street about ten days ago.
The" man entered the store and asked thi
clerk in charge to direct him to Laurel
Hill Cemetery. The clerk stepped outsido
with him to show him the direction to
take and when he returned the cash
register was empty. Corey describes th<.Â»
man who asked for the key as about 30
years of age; 5 feet 9 inches tall; dark
mustache and s!im build, and spoke like
an Englishman.

Martel came to the Pacific Coast from
Louisiana in 1S4C. Shortly after his ar
rival here he engaged in the real estate
business and gradually accumulated
wealth. At the time of his death he was
the owner of -much property, some of
which is on lower Market street. He
leaves two sons and three daughters.
Louis Martel and Alfred C. Martel arc
engaged in the fruit business af Mountain
View. One of his daughters. Miss Alice,
is unmarried; another is the wife of J.
W. Marsten. of the Crocker- Woolworth
Bank, and the third is the wife of C. J.
Stovel.
James L. Martel, a well known capital
ist and pioneer residing at 2613 Buchanan
street, was found dead In a. bath tub at
the Crystal Salt Water Baths, 317 Bay
street, early last evening. Whether he
â¢was overcome by some bodily weakness
and drowned accidentally or whether he
committed suicide is yet a matter ot con
jecture.
Martel has been in the habit of visiting
the baths every evening. He went there
at his accustomed time yesterday and
was assigned to a room. After an hour
had passed an attendant started on his
rounds to light up the premises. Coming
to the room occupied by Martel he
knocked on the door and reauested who
ever was inside to light the gas.
Receiving no response the attendant
tossed some matches over the top of the
door and repeated his request. Still no
answer came and an investigation was
started. A stepladder was secured and
the attendant looked over the top of a
partition which separates the small apart
ment from the main bathing room.
The body of Martel was found complete
ly submerged. Coroner Leland was then
notified and Deputies McCormack and
Brown commenced an Investigation. The
body was removed to the Morgue and the
relatives communicated- with. â¢
Dr. Barbat, who attended the capitalist
during his lifetime, said that Martel was
aillicted with no organic trouble which
would cause him to be overcome while in
the water. He said, however, that Mar
tel was about to have a surgical operation
performed, but that his trouble should not
nave weakened him to helplessness or un
consciousness. The relatives of the dead
man discard the theory of suicide. An
autopsy which will be performed to-day
will reveal the true facts.

and that his firm was acting for Bloom
Brothers of New York. Bunker listened
to the conversation, but said nothing to
the Consul General as to the alleged
agent and letters of advices he (Bunker)
had mentioned to a Call representative a
few minutes before.
Consul General Mejia of Salvador was
informed last evening of the statements
made by Broker Bunker.
"There is something very mysterious in
all this," said the Consul General: "If an
agent of my Government visited this city
en route to Mexico to buy arms and am
munition he certainly . would have called
upon me, even as a matter of official cour
tesy. Why should an agent go to a firm
of brokers and ask them to attend to a
shipment for my Government? That would
be my duty. I know nothing of any agent
being in the city or going to Mexico and
the conflicting statements cannot be rec
onciled." â¢ ; .

MORGAN BUYS
JESUITS' LAND
Secures Five Hundred
Acres Above Point
Bichmond.
Tract .Will Be Used as Ter
minus for the Morgan-;
Hill Roads.
J. Pierpont Morgan . has purchased a
large : tract' of bay -shore land adjoining
the Standard Oil Company's property
above Point Richmond, to be used, so it
is said upon reliable authority, as a term
inus for â¢ the Morgan-HiU syndicate of
railroads embracing the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific -roads. , .
The deal was put through a day or two
before the great financier, left for the
East, but the secret has been carefully
guarded by those interested in the matter.
The. purchase price is given out as some
thing over $100,000. The Jesuit Fathers
of this city owned the land, the deed be
ing held in the name of Father A. Mar
aschi.
The price paid by Morgan was a hand
some figure inasmuch as in 1895 the
Jesuits offered to sell the bay shore tract
for $25,000 and had it bonded until just a
few months ago to McEwen Bros.; the
local real estate agents, for $65,000.
Just what the plans of the Morgan-Hill
syndicate are in reference to extending
their lines through California to this city
is not known, but the project has been
under discussion for some time past. ' The
purchase included some 501 acres, extend
ing from thV northern bqundry of the
Standard Oil Company's tract above Point
Richmond, to Point San Pablo. Its bay
frontage runs from Point Mulatto, just
above Red Rock, to Point San Pablo.
The land purchased is only about a mile
and a half from the Santa Fe terminus
and along 1 its west shore 'there is plenty
of deep water. By building wharfs a
short distance into the bay vessels of the
deepest draught will be able to load and
unload with absolute safety.
Morgan's purchase was quite a pleasant
surprise to those interested in the general
development of that section of this vicin
ity. It Is understood that the work of
improving the property will be commenced
as soon as possible.
"We had the slice of land which Morgan
bought bonded for $85,000," said John J.
McEwen â¢ of McEwen Bros., when seen
last night. "We held the option on the
property until about six months ago,
when we gave it up. Shortly before Mor
gan's arrival our firm offered to again
bond the tract for $90,000, but the Jesuits,
who were probably then negotiating with
Morgan, refused our offer. The northern
end of the tract is a most valuable piece
of bay shore property. There is quite .a
deep water channel between Point. San
Pablo and 'Point Mulatto, which makes
dredging unnecessary:
. "Next to the Santa Fe terminus J should
say â¢ that the tract purchased by -Morgan
is one of the. best sites for railroad term
inal purposes on the bay shore." '
$2.00 EXCURSION
.To Monterey or Santa . Cruz.
The Southern- Pacific closes the season
by running first-class excursion trains to
both Monterey and Santa Cruz Sunday
next, the 27th inst. Judging from inquiries
being made for tickets, attendance will

sorts in question are anxious to learn
which will receive the larger patronage.
The Monterey excursion train will leave

SLAVE OWNERS
INCITE MURDER
Place a Price on Heads
of' Three Chinese
Informers.
Three lawablding Chinamenâ Lew Kim,
Quan Hing and Lew Quongâ have been
marked by the slave dealers of the Mon
golian quarter for betraying its members
to the Federal authorities. A price of
$500 has been set on each of their heads
and an additional sum is promised If they
are put outof the way within forty-eight
hours. The doomed Chinese yesterday
learned of the plot and they at once con
sulted Acting Chief of Police Wittman.
They claimed that five keepers of brothels
had formed the conspiracy to murder
them on account of their action in inform
ine the Federal officers of the existence
of g slavery in Chinatown. Wittman on
hearing their story at once sent for Ser
geant Conboy and ordered him to bring
the brothel-keepers to him. Conboy had
no trouble in finding the men and he
marched, them to police headquarters i On
being questioned by Captain Wittman
they nervously denied knowing anything
about the conspiracy. After satisfying
himself that they were responsible for a
price being placed on the men s heads
Wittman emphatically told them that if
anything happened to the marked Chi
nese he would hold them personally re-
SP The brothel-keepers left after promising,
not to molest the alleged informers.
A short time ago the Federal authorities
were informed that a- number of Chinese
girls had been smuggled into this country
by the local slave ring and held in bond
age in Chinatown. Accompanied by sev
eral' interpreters the officers Invaded the
Chinese quarter and raided a_ number of
brothels. Over fifteen girls, who had been
Illegally landed, were found in the dens
and placed under arrest. Lew Kim, Quan
Hing and Lew Quong were accused of
having informed the authorities and the
slave dealers swore vengeance against
them. Falling to get them in the several
traps which they had set for them the
slave owners set a price on their heads,
knowing that .a number of highbinders
would eagerly seize the chance of earning
the bloodmoney.
