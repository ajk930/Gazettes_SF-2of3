Delegates at the Convention in Wash

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
U'.. WASHINGTON. Dec 10.â The Amer
ican Beet Sugar Manufacturers' annual
convention held here to-day was rather
uneventful. After choosing officers, in
cluding H. T. Oxnard of California as
president, the convention passed several
resolutions expressing in general term.?
the sentiments of manufacturers concern
ing the beet sugar Industry.
The convention did not discuss the ques
tion of reciprocal trade relations with
Cuba looking to a possible reduction of
rates on raw and refined sugar imported
from Cuba to the United States. There
was a disposition In the convention not to
â¢ybe worried over the Cuban situation, the
Vceiing being general that Congress would
take care of the question of a proposed
reduction, of duty, and that the powerful

Magnificent Endowment.
Hon. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of
the United States Department of Labor,
to-day made the following statement as
to Carnegie's endowment of a national
university at Washington:
"The general discussion which has been
carried on during the last twenty-five
years in relation to the establishment of
a national university in Washington has
culminated in a. magnificent plan and en
dowment by Andrew -Carnegie. For a
number of years the university idea held
sugar interests would fight any conces
sions In the duty on Cuban sugar. The
action of the House . Ways and Means
Committee In the matter of the Philip
pine tariff was taken by the convention
to mean that the prospect of a reduction
of the duty on Cuban sugar is remote, for
the reason that if concessions cannot be
granted to Interests in the territory con
trolled by the United States, they are not
likely to be given to Cuba, a foreign coun

sway, but about two years ago the mat
ter was taken up by the "Washington
Academy of Sciences, and this body, in
co-operation with the George Washington
Memorial Association, formulated a defi
nite plan, which differed radically from
the university plan contemplated in the
earlier years. This resulted last spring,
as was then published, in the organiza
tion of the Washington Memorial Insti
tution.
Plan of the Enterprise.
"The plan was, in brief, as follows:
"L Organization. A private foundation
independent of â¢ Government support or
control. , â¢ . .
"2. Objects, (a) To facilitate the use of
the scientific and other, resources of the
Government for research; (b) to co-op
erate with universities, colleges and indi
viduals in securing to properly qualified
persons opportunities Â£or advanced study
and research.
"Dr. Daniel C. Gilman, ultimately prea
ident of the Johns Hopkins /University,
was elected director of the institution.
Not a Rival to Universities.
"When Mr. Carnegie came to consider
the question of endowing a National Uni
versity at Washington, he investigated
the whole subject with his usual tho
roughness and found that an institution
devoted to research and the training of
capable persons was more in accord with
his conceptions than the establishment of
a university that would be a rival of the
already existing universities of the coun
try. How far he was led to this conclu
sion by the work that had been done by
the organizations in Washington is un
known, but his action indicates that he
had faith in the general plan that had
been developed and crystallized in that
city.
"It is probable that ' the Washington
Memorial Institution will suspend Its
operation, for it is understood that Mr.
Carnegie's plan not only embraces all the
proposed activities of the institution, but
goes far beyond these."

Special Dispatch to i The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 14C6 G STREET, N.
W.;' WASHINGTON, Dec. S.~ Decidedly
strained relations exist- between Argen
tine and Chile. The two countries are on
the verge of war. There is no question
as to the accuracy of these statements.
The authority exists for making them
emphatic. In Pan-American circles, not
withstanding the understanding of the
Ministers representing the -^two Govern
ments that an amicable arrangement will
be reached, it is generally believed that
war is unavoidable! - â '< *
â¢ In this event the whole'of.jSouth Ameri
ca,, will be inflamed. Argentine is confi
dent that in a struggle with Chile she will
have the moral support of Paraguay and
Uruguay and the active support of Peru
and Bolivia. ' "With such odds against the
Santiago Government it is asserted that
it will be suicidal for it to engage in war
without reference to support of any other
country. Argentine, it is' learned, has
adopted a firm attitude and. is insisting
upon .the fullest explanation of the
Chilean invasion, of territory 'in - dispute
and now before the King of Great Britain
for arbitration. :. â¢',,'â¢ j 'â 'â â .:,'-'., â  ., .....
,â: Argentine's Minister Optimistic. $
The return to-day, of* Scnor Don Martin 1
Garcia Merou, Minister of Argentine . in
Washington, from the- City of Mexico,
where he has been in attendance upon the
Pan-American Congress as the delegate of
his Government, gave rise-to rumors that
the object of his visit was to request the
exercise by this Government of its good
offices to effect a settlement of the dis
pute of his country with Chile./ It is
learned, however.^ihat the Minister's re
turn has no immediate connection with
the Chilean 'trouble, though undoubtedly
now that he is in Washington this sub
ject will receive his ' careful attention.
Minister Merou is very optimistic as to
the outcome of negotiations under way be
tween his Government and Chile.
"My official advices," he said, "are that
the pending question in connection with
the construction by Chile of roads in the
territory in dispute between that country
and my own, which has been submitted
to the arbitration' of the Government of
Great Britain, is about to be settled in an
amicable and peaceful way. The two
Governments have, exchanged views on
the subject, and as both are animated by
sentiments of good feeling and realize the
great misfortune of war, I am confident
they ' will make every possible effort to
reach a settlement mutually satisfactory.
In the present situation of the world war
is a serious matter and involves great re
sponsibility for those responsible for - its
occurrence. It is only natural, therefore,
that both Argentine and Chile should be
endeavoring to find peaceful solutions/ I
ido not the situation is as serious
as the . press dispatches show, and I am
sure that the good relations that exist
between Chile and Argentine will con
tinue after the cloud now on the inter
national horizon has disappeared."
I Argentine Will Start Fleet,
.â 'senor Don Ellodoro Infante, Chilean
Cha'rge d'Affaires, called at the State
Department to-day and met the Argentine
Minister as he was leaving, in response
to a question, Senor Infante stat
ed/that he received advices three
days ago from â ' the Chilean Min
ister ' for Foreign Affairs * stat
ing that he could not understand the ex
aggerated reports of the press, which
were' unfounded. Senor Infante is as con
dent as Senor Merou that a peaceful set
tlement will be effected/
In other. quarters this same confidence
does not exist. The United States has
not interfered, nor has it the slightest in
tention to do so; Before war occurs it
will tender, its good offices, and Argentine
will probably " accept. Chile's attitude is
not as definitely known. If war occurs,
however, it is. expected that Argentine
will . immediately â¢ set her fleet in motion
for the Pacific, and one of the greatest
naval battles of modern times will proba
bly be fought on the Chilean coast.

LODGE SPEAKS
FOR THE TREATY
Massachusetts Senator
Tells of Britain's Con
.-..._ cessions. .7- R
New Plan, He Declares,
Should Be Acceptable to
Americans.
WASjailsGIOi*. DeCi. 10.â The open ces
sion "of the Senate to-day was devoted to
routine business, such as the presentation
of petitions, memorials and* bills. The
Senate then went into executive session
on motion "of Senator "Iiodee.- who. has
charge of the Hay-PAuncefote treaty. â¢
After .a' '"j&unVSSri" oE^iiorhlnatl^ns had
been . confirmed'' Senator Lodg e .called up
the Hay-Paunicefote -treaty . and made -. a
brief statement regarding: i that ; conven
tion. .The Senate then adjourned. in order
to give the Democratic caucus committee
an opportunity to hold a meeting." " â¢ â¢
Lodge contended that the new treaty,
does away'*' with all the objectionable fea
tures of the treaty of the:last Congress,
and enumerated the particulars in. which
the revised agreement conforms r to the
action of the Senate in the last Con
gress," when' the old treaty was before it."
He analyzed the new treaty from begin
ning to end, showing that in specific
terms It abrogates the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty of 1850, which he said had stood
constantly in the way of the construction
of an. isthmian canal. The abrogation of
this treaty, he contended, was a most im
portant achievement,, and he did not be
lieve that the United States should- or
would lose aa opportunity to make secure
that concession.
Senator Lodge also called attention to
the .omission in paragraph one of article
three of the words "in time of -war as In
time of peace." He said that In the old
treaty the paragraph read "that the
canal ehall be free and open in time of
war as in time of peace to the vessels of
commerce and of war of all nations on
terms of entire equality," etc. He urged
that the omission of this phrase had the
effect practically of leaving the United
States to do with the canal in time of war
according to its own pleasure. He also
referred to the fact that rule seven in the
treaty of the powers regulating the con
trol of the Suez canal, which had been
embodied in the original Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, had been omitted in the revised
draft. He quoted this rule, which pro
vided that "no fortifications shall be
erected commanding the canal or the
waters adjacent," etc.
This, he said, was a material concession
to the United States and was quite suf
ficient to meet the objections made
against the agreement that the United
States would have no power to protect its
property. It practically left the United
States free to fortify the canal In case
it should be considered desirable to do
eo, and was in line with the omission of
the restriction keeping the canal open in
time of war. The fact that the invitation
contained In the old treaty to the various
powers to give their adherence to the
agreement had been eliminated from the
new convention, he said, was another
compliance with the action of the Senate
on the original treaty.
These concessions, Lodge urged, were
ample, and he contended that they were
of such a nature as to render the new
treaty acceptable to all American citizens
who wanted to see a canal constructed.
Practically, he said. Great Britain had
agreed to turn the entire management of
the canal over to the United States, not
only in time of peace, but In time of war.
It is understood that the treaty will be
called up to-morrow.

OOTTBT MAKES RULING
IN SPANISH WAR CASE
Action by Minister of Marine Against
an English Company Is
Dismissed.
EDINBURGH. Dec. 10.â Court of Ses

by the Spanish Minister of Marine against

four torpedo-boat destroyers, which it was
claimed were required for the Spanish -
American war but were not delivered

The Sessions Court held that as the con
tract was made with a state which was
a monarchy the monarch alone could
make a claim. One of the Judges dis

to refuse the right to claim was to refuse

Commission on September 17, 1901, shall be
and remain in full force and effect."
The Democratic members were called in
at 11 o'clock and the committee was for
mally organized, the former clerks and
employes being re-elected and the sub
committees announced. The.' Democratic
members were .furnished copies of the
Payne Philippine bill and were advised
that It would be taken up at a meeting of
the committee to-morrow, reported to the
House on Friday next and considered . in
the House next Tuesday. The debate in
the House will be brief, probably not ex
ceeding a day, with a special rule provid
ing for bringing the question to a final
vote probably on Tuesday evening.
Chairman Payne stated that the Cuban
Commissioners had asked for a hearing,
and he suggested a hearing next Monday.
Russell then interposed a motion, which
prevailed, directing the chairman to ad
vise the Cuban Commissioners that it
would not be convenient for the commit
tee to hear them before the holidays, and
that after the holidays the committee
would consider the question. ,Tbe signi
ficance of this resolution, it was explained
after the meeting, was to postpone . the
question of Cuban reciprocity until action
had been matured on the Philippines.'

announced by Chairman Payne to-day,

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.'
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â The Pacific
Co'ast delegation generally fared well in
the House committee assignments an
nounced to-day by Speaker Henderson.
The old members of the California dele
gation got their former desirable places,
while the new members secured fair posi
tions. Both Loud and Kahn are especial
ly well placed, the former having again
his chairmanship of the Postoffice Com
mittee, the only Pacific Coast member
heading a committee except Tongue of
Oregon, chairman of the Arid Lands
Committee.
McLachlan is fortunate in his first as
signment, securing the much-sought place
in the Rivers and Harbors Committee.
Coombs has one good committee, while
Woods will- have to be content for the
present with rather unimportant places.
Needham gets his old position on Public
Lands and a new place on Indian Affairs,
but goes off the Claims Committee. Mat
calf, in taking membership on the Ways
and Means Committee, had to give up his
former place on Naval Affairs, â with the
result that the Pacific Coast is not nqw
represented on that committee.
ADJOUBNMENT IN JUNE.

These sub-committees will begin work
at once. Chairman Cannon said, how
ever, that as the holiday recess would

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WED J 90^
SEARCHING FOR WOMAN WHO
MAY CLEAR MURDER MYSTERY
Nevada County Officials Are Eager to Effect Capture of Mrs.
Charles Allen 'and Hope to Obtain From Her a; Confession That
Will Place tlip Slayer of Joseph Griffiths Behind Prison Bars
GRASS VALLEY JUNK DEALER WHO DIRECTED SUSPICION TOWARD HIMSELF - BY ACCOMPANYING TO
THIS CITY MRS. CHARLES ALLEN, WANTED IN CONNECTiON^WITH THE GRIFFITHS MURDER CASE,
AND IN CONSEQUENCE WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST BY LOCAL POLICE. V V * .
QRASS VALLEY, Dec. lO.-The
Griffiths murder mystery Is near
- ing a solution, and it-is expected
that by the end of the week the
â¢ murderer will be | confined in the
County Jail. . The Grand Jury convened
this morning, and the entire day was de
voted to the examination of witnesses.
Interest now centers in the quest of
Mrs. Charles Allen, who left here hurried
ly several weeks ago. It is believed that
she has full knowledge of the crime and
that when she is placed under arrest she
will tell who killed Griffiths. It was an
nounced here to-day that Mrs. Allen had
been arrested in San Francisco in com
pany with Richard Bennetts, a local junk
dealer. Later it was learned that the
San Francisco detectives had simply been
able to trace the whereabouts of the
couple during their stay in that city and
to arrest Bennetts, but that the woman
had disappeared. If it is her intention to
keep out of sight, she may lead the offi
cers a. lively chase. - : _â  .

STONE MISSES
HEAD OF EAMES
Celebrated Singer Has
Narrow Escape From
' Ipjury.
Broken "Window Glass Scat
, ' iered Over Her Face
DENVER, DeclO.â Emma Eames, the
celebrated soprano of Grau's company,
had a narrow escape from death or. seri*
oua injury last Sunday night while on a
Southern Pacific train coming from San
Francisco to Denver.
The singer was asleep in her. berth when
a stone crashed through the window and
fell on the pillow beside her head. Broken
glass was scattered over her face, but she
was not cut. She said to-day that if the
etone had entered the window three~incn.es
nearer her head she is sure she would
have been killed. She said an investiga
tion by officers of the Southern Pacific
road resulted in the discovery that the
stone was thrown by a. discharged em
ploye of the road seeking revenge.
"I'll never forget it. I love these little
excitements when they are over," said
the prima donna. "Anyway. I need some
thing like that to tone me down after my
glorious time in â¢ San Francisco. Never
were-' such people anywhere. Ah, how
beautifully, handsomely, they treated me.
It made me so happy to see people so ap
preciative."
A,T>VEB.TIS'F,'M HINTS.
WHAT_GO^ES UP
Must Come Down.
Nothing is* more certain than that the
use of so-called tonics, stimulants and
medicines, which depend upon alcohol for
their effect, is injurious to health in tho
leng run.
What goes up must come down and the
elevation of spirits, the temporary exhil-
aration resulting: from a dose of medicine
containing alcohol, will certainly be fol-
lowed in a few hours by a corresponding
depression to relieve which another dose
must be taken. .
In other words, many liquid patent med-
icines derive their effect entirely from
the alcohol they contain.
Alcohol and medicines containing it are
temporary stimulants and not in any
! sense a true tonic. In fact It is doubtful
if any medicine or drug is a real tonic "
A true tonic is something which will re-
new, replenish, build up the exhausted
nervous system and wasted tissues of the
body, something that will enrich the blood
and endow It with the proper proportions
of red and white corpuscles, which pre-
vent or destroy disease germs. This is
what a real tonic should do and no drug
or alcoholic stimulant will do it.
The only true tonic in nature is whole-
some food, thoroughly digested. Every
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of blood is created
daily from the food we digest.
The mere eating of food has little to do
with the repair of waste tissue, but the
perfect digestion .of the food eaten has
everything to do with it. .
- The reason so few people have perfect
digestion is because from wrong. habita of
living the stomach has gradually lost- the
.power to secrete the gastric juice, ' pep-
tones and acids in sufficient quantity.
) To f cure indigestion, and -^ stomach
troubles it Is necessary to take after
meals some harmless preparation which
will supply the natural peptone and dias-
tase which every weak stomach lacks,
and probably the best preparation of this
character is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
which may be found in every drug store
and which contain in pleasant palatable
â¢form the wholesome peptone and diastase
which nature requires for prompt diges-
tion.
One or two of these excellent tablets
taken after meals will prevent souring,
fermentation and acidity and insure com-
plete digestion and assimilation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are equally
valuable for little children as for adults,
as they contain nothing harmful or stim-
ulating, but only the natural digestives.
One of. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
digest 1S0O grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and they jj are in every
sense a. genuine tonic because they bring
about' in the only natural way a restora-
tive of nerve power, a building up of lost
tissue and appetite, in the only way it
can be done by the digestion and assimi-
lation of wholesome food.

HEADING FOR

Fleeing Cashier Probably
Speeding Through
Mexico.
It Is Believed He Intends
Boarding a Steamer for
South America.
Bank Attach.es Property of Fugitive
Greater in Value Than the
Amount of His Defal
cation.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 10.â The search
for Henry J. Fleishman, the absco'nding
cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants'
Bank, has thus xar been unsuccessful.
The only clew discovered by the police
officials, after running down every rumor
that came to their ears, is the fact that
Fleishman departed from the Arcade depot
of the Southern Pacific Company be
tween 8 and 9 o'clock last Saturday
morning. Some time between these hours
Fleishman appeared at the station, wear
ing an overcoat and carrying a light-col
ored hand satchel about fifteen inches
long. One of the railroad employes who
knows Fleishman spoke to him and In
quired as to his destination. The de
taulting cashier replied that he was go
ing over to Pasadena on some business.
The depot employe says he did not see
Fleishman againâ In lact, paid no fur
ther attention to him â and does not know
whether or not he purchased a ticket or
took the train. â¢
A policeman at the Southern Pacific de
pot, however, supplies the Information
that the railroad employe could not give.
He knows Fleishman well and could i\pt
be mistaken in the man, and he declares
positively that he saw the fugitive at the
depot between 8 and 9 o'clock on Satur
day, and that Fleishman boarded the
train for Pasadena. Fleishman entered
one of tbe coaches and had not emerged
when the train pulled out.
Buys Ticket in Pasadena.
The ticket to Boston which the cashier
purchased was bought in Pasadena on
Saturday, and not In this city. He board
ed a Southern Pacific overland train in
that city and started for the East. How
far he traveled on the Boston ticket Is not
yet known, but the authorities will soon
be able to land this information by trac
ing the ticket through coupons In the
hands of conductors along the line. It is
certain that the Boston ticket was bought
as a ruse and that the cashier did not
travel far on it.
It is believed that he left the train
somewhere in Arizona, New Mexico or
Texas, to connect with sOme branch road
that would carry him across the border
of Mexico. The theory Is that he is now
speeding toward Vera Cruz, with the in
tention of boarding a steamer in that port
for some point in South America. The
authorities are working on that supposi
tion.
Fleishman, had he remained on the over
land, would have reached El Paso Sunday
morning at 7:05 o'clock and a Mexican Cen
tral train departs three hours later. Had
the absconder planned otherwise, by using
the Sunset limited, be might have left
the train at Benson, A. T., stopping there
until Sunday night, when he could have
taken a train for Guaymas. That port is
crowded with tramp steamers plying be
tween the ports of Central and South
America.
If the fugitive continued his journey
to El Paso he is presumed to have halt
ed before reaching Mexico City, where
he is known. There is an extradition
treaty with the southern republic, a fact
of which he doubtless was aware. At
Vera Crux he could board a steamer for
Central American and South American
ports, whose ainhorities do not sur
render fugitives.
It is accepted as a fact that Fleishman
did not flee to Lower California, where
his ample funds would prove an attrac
tion to freebooters, who would not scru
ple to relieve him of his money.
How the Money Was Stolen.
Some interesting details in connection
with the flight of Fleishman came to
light during the Investigations conducted
to-day. It was not until last Friday that
his plans were perfected and the money

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1901.
VENEZUELA MAY FIGHT
BUT CAN HAVE NO AID
Uncle Sam Will Not Engage in That Cqun
tty's Controversy With Germany.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
f* ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W v WASH
& INGTON, Dec. 10. â President Castro will not
have the support of the United States in his defi
ance of Germany. " His declaration to the American
who visited him that he would -resist by 1 force the collection
of the German claim, though he was disposed to pacify Ger
many by, permitting the establishment of a German colony
on Venezuelan soil, attracted considerable attention in ad
ministration circles. President Castro can engage in war
with Germany if he wishes, but he certainly will not be al
lowed to cede territory to Germany for colonization pur
poses, nor is it probable that Germany would accept such a
concession. . _;.
"The Monroe doctrine," said President Roosevelt in his
annual message, "is a declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any . non- American power at the
expense of any American power .on American soil. We do
not guarantee any American state against punishment if it
misconducts itself, provided 'that the punishment cloes not
take the .form of acquisition of territory by a non- American
power."
Before Germany orders her fleet to seize Venezuelan
it is expected she will acquaint the United
States with her intentions at the German embassy. In an
swer to a question of Germany's attitude toward Venezuela
reference is made to a statement made by Baron von Hol
leben, the German Embassador, immediately after his re
turn from Berlin, that Germany has no thought-bf extend
ing her sovereignty over any portion of the -Western hem
isphere.
that he took with him was obtained
after the bank had closed that after
noon. How he obtained these funds is
described by the assistant cashier.
When the money was being stored in the
vault after the closing hour, Fleishman
and the assistant cashier deposited $60,000
in currency in a small box which was its
customary over night receptacle. While
the assistant turned around to get more
money to place in the vault, Fleishman
must have slipped the big bundle of bills
out of the box and secreted them in his
clothing. The assistant cashier was ab
sent but a moment, and Fleishman had
no time to lose. When the cash was
counted after the cashier's disappearance
the box that usually held the currency
was empty.
This $60,000 was all the cash that Fleish
man took with him in his flight. The bal
ance of his shortage represents money
that he .had taken from time to time
previous to his departure.
After ho had obtained tbe bundle of pa
per money by stealth, there was still one
chance open to the cashier to avoid- ex
posure, and he waited for this before
starting on his journey that may termi
nate in the penitentiary. It was that
some change in Wall street conditions
might come to his rescue and enable him
to make good the money he had previ
ously stolen from the bank. With this
faint hope he delayed his departure until
the following day. Early in the morning,
long -before the first, stock quotations
were ticked over the wires from ' New
York, he was in Creary's bucket-shop to
learn the opening quotation on Amal
gamated Copper. He could not conceal his
nervousness or the feverish anxiety with
which he scanned the figures when they
were posted. He had lost. Amalgamated
Copper had touched $61 50, its low water
mark. Fleishman went straight from the
bucket shop to the Arcade depot and his
flight had begun.
There Is no longer any doubt that it was
his losses In this copper stock that led to
the cashier's downfall. He Invested heav
ily in the stock when it was seling at $20
above par, and when the bottom fell out
of Amalgamated and he had used up his
ready cash to "cover" he drew upon the
funds of his .employers, believing that
there must come a turn In the downward
tide that would enable him to repay the
money without detection and save that of
his own that had disappeared In the
slump. His last hope went when the re
turns of Saturday morning showed that
Amalgamated, Instead of rallying, had es
tablished a new low- water mark.
Bank Is More Than Secured.
Fleishman has left behind a fortune
greater In value than that of which he
robbed the Farmers' and -Merchants'
Bank. In addition to the $30,000 bond sup
plied by a surety company and his real
estate, valued at $50,000, he held convert
iblo stocks in different corporations, to
the value of $75,000. These, together with
the real estate, have been attached by
the bank. The institution has $155,000 with
which to offset its loss, the highest esti
mate of which places it much below thts
figure.
These stocks were left by Fleishman In
the hands of a friend in this city, whosa
name the bank officials refuse to reveal.
When this friend learned of Fleishman's
heavy defalcation he went to the bank
and informed it that he was the custodian
of the stocks. They were at once at
tached and will go fax toward "squaring"
the fugitive's account with his employers.
The directors of the bank met to-day
and set an expert at overhauling all of
Fleishman's accounts. Nothing further
than the statement given out yesterday
as to the amount missing, it was said at
the bank, had developed. State Bank
Commissioner Barrett made an examina
tion of the books to-day, and found Lhe
institution in a splendid condition.
The directors have authorized an offer
of $2500 reward for the apprehension of
Fleishman and an additional $2500 for the
return of the missing . money. >;.
I Judge Shaw granted the writ of attach
ment on the property of Fleishman," upon
the request of Graves, O'Melveny& Co.,
attorneys for the Farmers' and Mer
chants' Bank.
WOMAN WITH FLEISHMAN'.
Constant Companion of Cashier Whllo
He Was in Bakersfield.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 10.â Henry J.
Fleishman, the absconding cashier of the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Los
Angeles, was In this city on November 8
last, having been brought here as a wit
ness In the A. L. Forsythe forgery case
on a bench warrant issued from the Su
perior Court. At that time he testified
that Forsythe had no account with the
bank of which he was cashier and on
which the arrested man had forged
checks and cashed them.
Fleishman was in this city but one day
and evening. While here he was In com
pany with a woman. Fleishman was reg
istered at the Southern Hotel, but there
is no record of the woman on the hotel
register. Whether she came with Fleish
man or met him after his arrival is not
known. Fleishman has many friends in
this city, and, while he was seen by some
of them In company with the woman,
they profess ignorance as to her identity
or the city of her Vesidence. She was a
decided- brunette of striking appearance
and was attired in a dress of rich, dark
material. It Is known, however, that the
unknown woman was not a resident of
Los Angeles or Bakersfield. This much
is vouched for by Fleishman's friends,
who refuse to talk much concerning the
case, as they do not wish to gain pub
licity thrtiugh the predicament in which
Fleishman finds himself.
- The cashier while in Baker sfleld lived
quietly. He kept constant company with
his, female companion, but evidently he
and she were careful to avoid attracting
undue attention. On the evening of the
day on which Fleishman arrived In this
city : he and some of his friends attended
the floral fair which â  was given at that
time. by the Woman's Club. The friends
who saw Fleishman with his companion
and who profess ignorance as to her
identity give as an excuse for their lack
of attention to detail so far as the woman
was concerned that they paid no particu
lar attention to her or her dress, as It
was not dreamed that Fleishman would
ever be In trouble. There was no reason
why they should' observe her. closely.
Those who know Fleishman best In this
city are" evidently aware of the name and
place of abode of the woman! but they
refuse absolutely .to say anything con
cerning her further than to deny that she
Is a resident of this city or Los Angeles.

Santa Clara Constable Arrests an
' Intoxicated Ironmolden
SANTA CLARA, Dec. 10.â Local peace
officers were thrown Into a furor of ex
citement this evening over the prospect of
catching Fleishman, the absconding bank
cashier of Lo3 Angeles. Well dressed and
drunk, 'with a few dollars which he spent
lavishly, B. F. : Dudley, an iron-molder,
who came from Boston to '. work In the
Risdon : Iron- Works' in, San- Francisco a
short time ago, was taken for the default
er. Constable Lovell made " the i arrest
early in the evening and notified Sheriff
Langford. Dudley. was too intoxicated to
give an account of himself, but after a
couple of hours' quizzing he regained his
senses enough to prove .who he was.
Dudley was well dressed and about the
height and build of Fleishman, but hte
hands showed he had been used /to hard
labor. In ' his pockets was $27. After be
ing satisfied that the man was not Fleish

ASSASSIN TRIES
TO END HER LIFE
Woman Found Badly
Wounded in a Wash
ington House.
Case Like That of Young
Ay ers Puzzles the De
tectives.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â Mrs. Ida GU
bert Dennis, a dressmaker, was found In
an almost dying condition in her room at
5 o'clock this morning under circum
stances that promise to rival the Bonine
murder case. Her skull was .fractured,
her Jawbone was broken and her left ear
was almost severed from the head. Her
left arm bore bruises indicative of a
struggle, and her \ clothing and the bed
ding were saturated with blood. She was
removed to the Garneld Hospital. The
name of her assailant is unknown.
The general belief . is that Mrs. Dennis
was attacked while asleep in her back
room on the first floor, and that the first
blow,'. In : all probability administered with
the piano stool, which was smeared with
blobd, rendered her unconscious. The pre
liminary investigation by the police failed
to. indicate that there was any struggle.
Mrs. Dennis, in a conscious moment while
being carried to the hospital, said that
some, one had â  "hurt" her, but when
pressed' for - details merely responded.
"Never mlnd.V â¢ '. . v
Robbery. was apparently not the motive
for the crime, for on the table at the foot
of the bed was a small box containing: a
pocketbook well j filled with greenbacks
and coin. There was a bloody imprint of
a hand on the piano lid in the parlor, and
a window in that room was open. It is
supposed the assailant escaped through
thts window. When found Mrs. Dennis
was clad In her night garments and was
in bed under the cover. She was partly
conscious, although she has been uncon
scious most of the time since. -
The detectives are satisfied that the sev
eral blows of the piano stool must have
been wielded with considerable force, and
that there was no outcry. Mrs. Dennis'
groans, however, were heard by a woman
on the third floor and in the adjoining
house. About the same time Policeman i
Livingston and a watchman, who were
two blocks away, heard what they be
lieved to be a woman's scream. Mrs.
Dennis is about 47 years of age and is one
of the best /known women in business
here. She is the widow of Walter Den
nis, an actor. An operation was per
formed on Mrs. Dennis at the hospital
this afternoon. Very little hope is held
out for her recovery.
Complete mystery as to the motive for
or the perpetrator of the assault on Mrs.
Dennis continues to surround the case.
The police have been baffled in their ef
forts to obtain any clew upon which to
prosecute their work. Many theories as :
to the motive for the crime are being con
sidered by them, but absolutely no facts
have developed upon which to base a
clew to the person or persons implicated.
The victim of the assault remains In a
precarious condition at the hospital. The
physicians say she may regain conscious
ness, in which event It is expected she
will say something that will give the po
lice something to work upon. To-day in
brief periods of lucidity she mentioned
the name of a man whom she knew and
the police are seking to ascertain if he
possibly could be connected with the case
in any way. No arrests have yet been
made. The physicians hold out only a
slight hope of the woman's recovery.

Several Witnesses Are Called Before the Examining Board to Testify
Concerning the Behavior of the Deckhands After the Collision
Between the Two Ferry-Boats During the Heavy Fog
THE -passengers of the. ill-fated San

story yesterday in the presence of
United States Inspectors of Steam
Vessels Bulger and Bolles. Hith
erto mates and captains and crews unbos
omed themselves. Now come. the passen
gersâmen who helped to save lives and
â whom the fog did not daunt. They all
told tales of heroism, bells and a dense,
impenetrable fog-.
Frederick J. Hood was the first witness
of the day. He testified that the passen
gers did most of the life-savtng:. He did
not think the crew as a whole was of
much account. Of Captain McKenzie's ac
tions he said not'iing- but good. "The crew
did not appear well drilled," he said.
"Some of them above told the women to
go below. Those below told the women to
go above."
Then came Dennis Gorman, a marine
engineer by occupation, connected with
the ferry-boat Tamalpals. Gorman's mind
was wholly taken up with fog whistles,
signals and technicalities.
Few Workers Among th" Crew.
Gorman was succeeded on the stand by
\V. D. Oatrssen, a passenger on the San
Rafael. . ~
"Aa the Sausalito came alongside," he
said, "it looked as if she were going to
pass us. It seemed to me that out of a

Jockey Winnie O'Connor has a violent
attack of pugilistic fever, for which Alex
Greggains of the San Francisco' Athletic
Club\ has undertaken to provide an anti
dote. It will assume the shape of one of
the hard-hitting y6ung. boxers who learn
ed the rudiments of the game in- the club
gymnasium. ; â¢ ,
O'Gonnpr . has been a regular attendant
at all the minor club fights since he came
to this coast upon 'the \bpening of the
racing season. He has always been near
the ringside" and seme humorist has inva
riably announced that he would fight the
winner. * '
O'Connor generally entered a mild ob
jection, saying: "I don't want any of his
game." He has changed his mind, how
ever,. and Greggains has agreed to find;a
hundred-pound opponent for him. He will
also provide a gold medal for which ,the
boxers willfight. The bout will take place
at Mechanics' Pavilion the night Gardner
and Kid Carter settle their differences.^
Sam McGibben, who cpllects the jockey
mounts at Oakland racetrack, has not de
cided what boy will take O'Connor's plac-2
the* day after the fight. >
O'iConnor Boxing With Simms.
O'Connor is boxing daily with Art
Simms, the clever Cleveland lightweight,
and will be in condition for any kind of a
bout/ He is the holder of a medal em
blematic of the hundred-pound champion
ship of Brooklyn and wants to add to his
title that of champion of the Pacific
Coast , at the weight. As the majority of
Greggains' bantam-weights can hit like
Jeffries,. O'Connor will quickly decide
whether he wants to continue in the ring
or devote his talents to earning $25,000 a
year in the saddle.
: Kid Lavigne and Tim Heagerty, the Aus
tralian boxer, who came to this country
especially to fight Terry McGovern, will
meet in a fifteen-round bout to-morrow
night at-the. Acme Club, -Oakland. â They
are to weigh in at 130 pounds and each will
be within ounces of the. 1 stipulated
weight. . Heagerty has been gaining
steadily in weight. since he arrived, here
and should be strong and fast. The fight
should be a repetition of the "Young Cor
bett"-Terry McGovern encounter.
Heagerty a, Natural Fighter.
Heagerty's natural instinct when he
draws on the gloves is to attempt to an
nihilate the man in front of nun. He tried
this with Gus Ruhlin when the latter was
in condition to meet Jeffries. He cut
Ruhlin's mouth and nose and blacked his
eyes and made good his escape before
Ruhlin could reach him. â  â¢â¢
The spectators who saw Kid Lavigne in
his remarkable fight with Walcott know
his caliber. How much he has lost since
then in speed is a question which cannot
be answered until ,the fight is -over. , No
gamer man than Lavigne ever entered a
ring. From Heagerty's record in Austra
lia it is evident he 'does not know the
meaning of fear.
.The majority of the spectators from this
city will take the. 7:30 p. m. . narrow-gauge
boat. "Jack" Kitchen will referee, the
bout. â¢ " â .
.George Gardner -and Kid Carter , are in
active training for their return match 1n
Mechanics' Pavilion on the 20th inat.
Both have increased materially in weight
since their. first meeting some months
since. Carter showed, improved... form

BEDECK BEATS OUT WYOMING
IN A LONG, PUNISHING DRIVE
Sir Lewis- Fails to Finish Inside the Money â Fitzkanet Captures An
other Purse â Bedner First at Odds of 12 to i, Ridden by Bull
manâWinnie O'Connor Past the Judges on Three Winners
WYOMING, the war horse from
Gaylon Brown's' stable, lost
: one more head finish yester
day at Oakland track. This
time Bedeck, with Winnie
O'Connor up, accomplished the feat. Old
"Wyoming did not seem disgruntled, for
he has played the star role in tod many
hard luck tales in the past. ' Caesar
Young's .mare Eonlc : opened favorite for
the race, which happened, to be the
fourth, a seven furlong run. . Reports of
her condition were not flattering and the
smart ones played Bedeck down from 3
to 7 to 5,, making him practically the post
choice. Wyoming seemed possessed of all
colors of speed, and Woods, toddying to
him, took the lead, --Eonic soon falling
out of it. From the head of the stretch
home ' Wyoming and Bedeck had it out,
the latter getting the verdict. Possibly if
Woods had waited with Wyoming the
result might have been different, for the
aged gelding, runs best when ridden that
way.
Condition of Track Improved.
There was a great improvement, in the
condition of the track, and this afternoon
it ought to be fast. Besides Bedeck, two
other favorites, Fitzkanet and Redwald,
gathered purses. â¢ â¢
Walter Jennings sent two to the barrier
for the maiden two-year-old scramble in
El Bano and Bussezo. He did not think
much of either. El. Bano won all the way,
with 6 to 1 about the pair coupled. Bar
ney Schreiber's Schwarzwald beat Ro
sarie a neck for the place. Angeleno, the
favorite, finished back in the bunch.
A 4 to 5 favorite. Fitzkanet, piloted by
J. Daly, won the first six furlong selling
dash. Leading from the start, he .led
Floronso and King Dellis out a couplfe of
lengths.
undoubtedly the severest fall the talent
took was when Mike Daly's Sir Lewis for
got to finish among the first three in the
two-year-old event. He was plunged on
at short odds, but his recent races in the
mud must have dulled his sham edge.
Commissioner Forster Wins.
Commissioner Forster, a 7 to 1 shot,
with Woods in the saddle, disposed of
Landseer in a drive after Flo Culver had
cut out the running.
In the (mile selling affair Redwald had
nothing to beat, finishing first by three
lengths with pounds to spare. El Rey
lost the place to Canejo, a 20 to 1 out
sider, by. a head.
Jockey John Bullman, on Bedner. a 12
to 1 shot, beat a fair field of sprinters in
the final race of the day. He cut several
of the other starters off when the barrier
was released, and in a long drive with
the favorite. Prjncess Titania, downed the
filly a length. The latter was pounds the
better had she not been cut off and then
hustled along too fast to make up lost
ground. Hungarian also had a tempestu
ous .voyage.
Track Notes.
Tommy Magee, who for a number of
years was with Ed Corrigan, will be here
In a few days to take charge of the sta
ble of L.-V. Bell,. the wealthy New York
turfman.
Winnie O'Connor piloted three winners
in El Bano, Bedeck and Redwald. His
ride on the latter horse was a nice piece
of horsemanship.
"Frisco" Lind tried King Dellis with
out blinkers and the horse seemed to run
better. â¢;
Mike Daly says his boy Larry is always
getting beaten on favorites. It might be
a good system for Mike to put Johnny
Daly on the favorites and Larry on the
longshots. . â¢ â¢ . . . . .â¢
The I firm of Forsythe & Chinn made
their first start at the meeting with Mon
tana'Peeress and Matin Bell. ... - "

EASTERN STARS TO MEET
THE PENNANT WINNERS
For the Second Time Pitcher Whalen
Will To-Day Face the Crack
Baseball Players.
Jimmy Whalen is to have another
chance to demonstrate his capacity as a
twirler in fast company. Though it was
first intended to play the baseball pen
nant winners in only two games against
the American Association stars, so great
has been the demand for another contest
that the management decided to bring the
two teams together this afternoon.
Jimmy Whalen. who won his game last
Saturday, is to 'do the boxwork for tho
California champions. Whalen is eager
for another go with the heavy stickers of
the big league, and the visitors are anx
ious for another chance to straighten out
his curves. Bernhard will make his first
appearance in the box here. He will do
the pitching for the Eastern team. He is
said to be a faster man than Waddell.
The Oaklands will go against the visitors
to-morrow and Friday. The Sacramentoa
will have their chance Saturday and Sun
day to show what they can do. From
what has already been seen of the.East
ern men it is evident â  they are all they
are represented to be. The home team
has demonstrated that the California
League men are capable of playing fast
ball. The game will be called at 2:45 p. in.
BICYCLE RIDERS ROZjXi
UP A GREAT MILEAGE
Six-Day Record Will Probably Be
Beaten in the Madison-Square
Garden Bace. ; .:- :.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â The competitors
in the six-day bicycle race at Madison
Square Garden were grinding away tb
night to retain their positions. Before
another day has passed the record Is like
ly to be broken. In the early morning
the men were going at a loafing pace, but
this evening sprints were frequent At 7
o'clock the eighteen miles the leaders had
fallen behind tho record had been reduced
by eight miles. . .
To-night there were 5000 people in the
garden. At 7:30 o'clock King and Samuel
son, the latter relieving his partner, made
a" daring attempt togain the'lap which
would put them in line with the leaders.
The "Mormon 1 ' boys' effort was a spirited
one. Billy â  King sprinted and gained a
lead of one-quarter of the oval amid tre
mendous applause. His partner relieved
him and held this slight : gain for some
time, until Walthour caught him. Mc-
Eachern then relieved Walthour and the
pace continued fast, â¢ ,
Before midnight the crowd was esti
mated at 10,000. The score at iyo* clock
was: t ' 'â â '. â '.'â¢ - '

roy of Chicago at the Palace

Frank R. Lanterman, the -well known
young bookmaker and turf plunger of Chi
cago,, and Miss Grace G. Conroy, also of
Chicago, were married last evening at
the Palace Hotel, in the parlor of Joe

The pretty ' bride arrived from Chicago
on the Overland Limited at 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon and within an hour and
a half the ceremony was performed.
Mr. and Mrs. Eppinger, went to much
pains to decorate their rooms for the oc
casion. The flowers used were California
violets.-
I Frank 5 Lanterman, the bridegrroom, Is
well known on the turf. He sprung: into
prominence about two years ago and
though quite a young man he has amassed
a large fortune. It is said of him that

days at Del Monte and spend the rest of
their honeymoon in Southern California.
COLORED POLITICIAN
DIES IN THE HOSPITAL
John Wilkins, an Old-Time Cam
paigner, Succumbs to an Attack
of Apoplexy.
John "Wllkins,; colored, who was widely
known in political circles" as "Long John
Wllkins," died last night at the Central
Emergency Hospital. ' Death was due to
apoplexy. He was first stricken while
riding on a Market-street car Monday
afternoon on his way to the City Hall.
When the car 'was opposite the Grand
Hotel Wllkins complained of feeling faint
and requested that' he be allowed to get
off at Montgomery street. Before the
car stopped,, however, he commenced to
totter. He tried to grasp the strap, but
failed and fell heavily face downward to
the pavement.
Wilkins was a familiar figure In mu
nicipal and State politics. He took active
interest In. all- the campaigns and was
considered a leader among the colored
people. 'His influence at different j times
was exerted in behalf of both parties. He
was always expecting a reward for his
political labors, but In -the distribution of
patronage he was Invariably overlooked.
Continual disappointment in his demand
for the recognition of his services soured
his temper, and in recent years he was
always on the watch for enemies, whom
he accused of having deprived him of
hi3 just reward." ,

MRS. STANFORD'S WORK.
BY the transfer to the trustees of Stanford Uni
versity of property estimated to have a value
of $30,000,000 Mrs. Stanford has virtually
completed the task which passed into her hands upon
the death of her husband. The University at Palo
Alto is now founded and endowed with a wealth
â¢which is. believed to exceed that of any other insti
;ution of learning in the world. Moreover, much of
;he endowment is in the form of property which will
augment in value with the development of the State
and the increase of population, and consequently the
university will have many years of growth before it
reaches the full measure of the gifts the founders
have bestowed upon it.
Under any circumstances the actual transfer of so
Urge an endowment into the hands of trustees of an
institution designed for the general good would be
a notable event. In this case, however, there is
something more than a mere transfer of wealth. The
deed of gift represents the completion of one of the
most difficult duties an American woman has ever
been called upon to perform. It was no slight task
that fell to the lot of Mrs. Stanford when Senator
Stanford died. She was called upon to take charge
<oi a vast property, to arrange with lawyers for the
Settlement of the various questions involved in the'
probate of the will and the distribution of the es
tate, to guard her interests and those of the univer
sity in all the complications arising out of the rela
tions of the Southern Pacific Company to the Gov
ernment and to its creditors, to manage the business
of the extensive farms and vineyards of the estate,
and, finally, to provide funds at all times for the
maintenance of the university without sacrificing the
funds and properties designed for the permanent en
"dowment.
All of those duties Mrs. Stanford has performed
not only with a noble fidelity to the wishes of her
husband and a devotion x to the welfare of the uni
yersity, but with conspicuous success. She has done
something more than save the estate. She has in
creased its value, and the endowment is much larger
than was at first estimated.
In carrying out the great task intrusted to her
Mrs. Stanford not only met every difficulty of labor
or of finance without shirking, but frequently made
great personal sacrifices â¢ for the purpose of â¢ ac
complishing the noble end she had in view. That
she had able and faithful counselors and advisers at
all times is to be conceded, but those advisers did
not always agree, and in many a crisis she was com
pelled to rely upon herself alone and to act upon her
own judgment. The credit for final success belongs,
therefore, fully to her, and it will be cordially given
by ail who have any knowledge of the labor by which
it has been attained.
California's good fortune is nowhere more strik
ingly shown than in the process of events by which
at this early stage in her history as an American
State she becomes possessed of two of the foremost
universities in the world. The future of each insti
tution is assured. For the present Stanford is richer
than the State University, but in the end the latter
will derive from taxation and from the gifts of liberal
citizens an endowment that will exceed even that of
the great institution at Palo Alto. They will never
have any rivalry other than that of a generous nature.
Like Oxford and Cambridge in old England and
Harvard and Yale in New England, they will mu
tually advance one another by inciting a healthful
emulation in all lines of endeavor, from athletics to
scholarship. In that consciousness the people of
California may congratulate one another upon the
munificent foundation of Senator Stanford and upon
the fidelity and efficiency with which Mrs. Stanford
has brought it to realization.
A New Yorker who, it is claimed, was caught
cheating at cards has sued his accusers for $100,000
damages to his feelings. It would be interesting to
know what damage he did to the purses of his
friends. . . â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1901.
THE PHILIPPINE DECISION.
THE minority of the Supreme Court which dis
sented from the Porto Rico decision now ac
cepts that as the law of the land, and, unexpect-^
edly to the majority. which delivered it, applies it to 1
the Philippines. In this application Chief Justice
Fuller is joined by Justices *Brown, Harlan, Peck
ham and Brewer; Justices Gray, Shiras, White and
McKenna dissenting. It will be seen that Justices
Brown held the balance of power, as'he did in the
Porto Rico case. This decision is said to have been
hailed with mad delight by the commercial classes at
Manila, those philanthropists leaping to the conclu
sion that it means free trade with the United States.
There is nothing in the decision to justify this exul
tant expectation. The court decides that the Philip
pines are domestic and not foreign territory. Up to
this time we have collected Dingley duties on their
importations to the United States. But the Dingley
tariff was made to apply only to importations from
foreign countries. As the Philippines are decided
not to be foreign, we cannot apply to them a law
made for foreign goods only. But that does not s at
all mean. that they are to have free trade with us.
The court has already settled in the Porto Rico case
that Congress may pass a tariff law applying to do
mestic territory, and Congress has acted upon that
authority. It will act upon it in regard to the Phil
ippines, and that speedily. All the duties heretofore
collected here and in the Philippines will have to be
refunded. But hereafter a tariff wall against them
will be built as high as the protected interests of this
country feel to be necessary. There is no 1 question
of sentiment about it. It is practical business. Be
coming part of our territory has made a political, not
a physical, change in the Philippines. Their produc
tion is just as inimical to ours as it was before.- The
sun is vertical still. The land is tropical. . Its only
possible labor is servile. These conditions inhere in
physical causes that neither politics nor prayer can
budge, and the sooner our people comprehend this
the better will it be for all concerned. Information
and vigilance are required to prevent to this nation
consequences like those that come to the small boy
who cats unripe fruit. A bill is already before Con
gress to admit Porto Rico as a State. We have seen
a few Porto Ricans in California, en route to the
plantations of Hawaii. They were representative
citizens of that tight little island. The idea of their
equal fellow-citizenship with us is repugnant. \ Very
speedily there will be a statehood proposition for the
Philippines. We don't want our birthright 'divided
with them. The Filipinos and the Porto Ricans are
the fruit of a conquest we did not intend to make,
: and the fruit is unripe. It will never ripen into
American ideas of government. To partake of it as
a statehood dish means the gripes and pains that al
ways follow such experiments.
Let us put statehood for these islands away, and
let us put between them and our producers a tariff
that will protect us. The free traders and sentimen
talists will talk about our obligation to those peo
ple. We are under no obligation to injure our-,
selves. The Porto Ricans and Filipinos are not hurt
by a tariff against them. It takes not a banana off
their tables, nor a nipa leaf off their huts. They
are not clamoring for free trade. Those who do are
the exploiting classes from th*is country and else
where, who want free trade that they may make a
fortune before the climate makes their livers declare
war and strike for the temperate zone.
At King Edward's* coronation a great many of the
ancient privileges of aristocracy are to be abolished.
The man with the hereditary right to carry the
King's bow and arrows is â  not to be permitted to
make use of it, the hereditary champion who chal
lenges to single combat any contestant of the King's
right is also to be deprived of a chance to show him
self, and, saddest fate of all, the woman who has the
ancient privilege of scattering flowers before the
King is to be shut out. The coronation is to be an
cient in seme of its ceremonies, but not too ancient.
EUROPEAN ALLIANCES.
y-\ ISPATCHES from London to the effect that
Uthe Saturday Review . advocates a Germanr
British "friendship" for the. purpose of hold
ing the United. States in check, while the Spectator
favors the formation of a British alliance with Rus
sia for the purpose of checkmating Germany, are not
surprising. In fact; the relations between European
nations with respect to "world politics" are now so
complicated that abler , diplomatists than those who
edit London reviews are unable to determine in what
direction their most important interests lie and what
alliances would be most profitable to them.
If the Germans be really eager to gain a foothold
in this hemisphere, as the recent appropriations to
maintain German schools in Brazil seem to imply,
they would be wise in forming any kind of alliance
that would help them, for certainly they cannot deem'
themselves able to single-handed set the Monroe
doctrine aside. Great Britain, however, would be
about the last nation in the world to assist in any such
German scheme, for she. has much to lose and noth
ing "to gain'by conflict with the United States. Fur
thermore, in the present state of feeling between the
people of Germany and those of Great Britain a
"friendship" is hardly attainable by t the wisest di
plomacy. German dislike of American trade competi
tion may be keen, but it is not bitter; while the an
tagonism, to Britain because of the war against the
Boers is almost strong enough to force the* German
Government into active interference on the side of
the Boers.
While affairs on this side of the globe and in Africa
tend to prevent any kind of alliance or agreement as
to joint action between the British and the Germans,
the situation in Asia renders such an agreement al
most imperatively necessary. At the present time
Germany and Russia. are rivals for the possession of
railroad terminals on the Persian Gulf. The Rus
sians are extending their Central Asian railways
southward to the gulf, while the Germans have a con
cession from the Sultan 'for a railway from the Bos
phorus* eastward to the limit of his dominions, and
the road must have a seaport on the gulf or be com
paratively valueless. Great Britain also desires to
extend her. Indian ' lines westward to < the gulf
so as to connect with : the German lines and
thus form an all rail route .to India through
Southern Asia as an offset to the Siberian
road. In that part of the world, therefore,
British and German interests are identical, and both
are opposed to Russian interests. How, then, could
Britain and Russia form an alliance against Germany?
I . Finally, the aggressions of Russia in Manchuria
are formidable to Germany and Great Britain alike,
out much more to the former than to the latter! It
might be that the Czar and the Kaiser could agree
upon a Chinese policy, but it is not likely that Eng
land and Russia â¢ could, agree. -On the other hand
[ there is no commercial- rivalry between the Russians
and the British as there is, between each r of those na
tions and the Germans. The British have no agri
cultural products to export noV have the Russians
any. manufactured goods, so they do not conflict in
trade. Each oi) them, however, has a conflict with
Germany, where the agrarians are trying to keep Rus
sian wheat and rye out of the country, and the manu
facturers are trying to exclude British goods.
The complexity of the situation has its advantages,
it compels all parties to keep the peace. A war be
tween. Germany and Britain.,would give Russia a" free
hand on the Persian Gulf,"' and both the warring na
tions would be virtually shut out of all Asia between
the Euphrates and India, while a war of either of
those powers with Russia would give the other a
free hand elsewhere, with results disastrous . to the
fighting parties. ' -
As for ourselves, we need neither'seek an alliance
with any power nor fear one. The Monroe doctrine
stood during our years of comparative weakness, and
there is no danger it will be set aside now. It looks
as if the world were to have a long period of peace
between the great powers. War would involve pos
sibilities of disaster not in battle alone, but in empire
itself, ami the risk., is", too great for. any nation to
undertake.' The concert of Europe is evidently
booked to give a continuous ; performance for many
a year to come. : â  â¢
There may-be nothing more than a coincidence in
'the fact that the chaplains of both branches of Con
gress are blind, but it looks as if the' members of
each House had decided that it is safest not to have
a chaplain who. could" keep an^eye on them.
A ; CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION.
HAVING adopted the^^raunhart resolutions
concerning the proposed' amendment to the
constitution providing for the creation of an
extraordinary commission witlf* something like a uni
versal power for regulating corporations, the Board
of Supervisors is now in a position to begin at once
an aptive campaign of education on the subject. The
committee appointed for that purpose should imme
diately get into communication with city and county
governments throughout the State in order that a
combined effort may be made to bring to public at
tention the evil nature of the scheme embodied in
the proposed amendment. /
Should the amendment be carried the people would
be at the mercy of a commission appointed *by Gov
ernor Gage but dictated by the corporations en
gaged in the management of what are known as pub
lic utilities. The commission would be composed of
five members holding office from two to ten years.
One of the members would retire and a new one be
elected every two' years, but the Gage commission
would have power for full six years before it would
be possible for the people to have even a chance of
electing a majority of the members. Moreover, the
amendment is so framed. that comparatively few citi
zens of 'property would be eligible to the commis
sion. It is provided that the Commissioners shall not
be holders of stock in. railroads, water, gas, express,
electric or^ telephone companies, or any other of the
corporations whose rates are to be regulated by the
commission. Thus the choice of Commissioners
would be limited to but a. small proportion of the
prosperous people of the State, and hardly, any 'but
professional politicians would be eligible. â¢: ! .-' f
The Call has repeatedly directed attention to this
measure, because it is one whose menace to 'the peo-l
pie cannot be too often pointed out. - .Virtually
would deprive municipalities and counties, of any ef
fective supervision of the corporations controlling
public utilities. Local government in that respect
would be annihilated, and the proposed State com
mission would have exclusive authority.
It is right and proper that the present local author
ities of cities and of counties should take an active
part in the campaign of education on the subject,
but the matter should not be left wholly to them.
The issue is one of concern to 'every voter in the
State, and all who take an intelligent interest in pub
lic affairs should co-operate in the effort to make cer
tain its rejection at the hands of the people.
It must- not be supposed that a scheme so patently
evil will defeat itself. It is well known that a con
siderable number of voters pay but little attention to
constitutional amendments unless they refer to some
issue that has long been a -subject of popular discus
sion, and consequently it is easy to foresee that the
evil of this amendment will not be understood unless
it is clearly pointed cut. The defense of the scheme
by the railroad organ in this city shows that the
Southern Pacific corporation is backing the amend
ment. What further warning can be needed? The
campaign of education should be undertaken sys
tematically as soon as possible and continue until
the defeat of the project is assured.
While Populism in, every, other part of the Union
seems to have gone glimmering through the mist of
things that were, there is still enough of it in Kansas
to make a noise, and just now it is clamoring against
any further fusion with Democracy. -
A proposed amendment to, the constitution of
Georgia designed to restrict negro suffrage has just
been voted down by the Legislature by an over
whelming majority, and so on that phase of politics
the South is not to be solid.
Something appears to be. radically wrong in the
administration of the affairs of the .local .Board of
Public Works. The board has not recently com
mitted any act in direct violation of its line of public
duty. â¢
. After all the discussion as to the best tactics for
Democrats to pursue in Congress, the matter will
probably, result in leaving each one free to make, his
own kick in his own way and at whatever he pleases.
We are to have something like $100,000,000 of-sur
plus in the national treasury this year, but as every
Congressman has ; gone, to Washington* with a rake
they, will probably be able to get away with it.
' However much , economical citizens may be dis
turbed over the surplus in the treasury, they can find
consolation in the. thought that the Democrats will
not have a chance to monkey. with it. '",â ..' ' :
It looks now as if there would be enough anti
anarchist bills introduced into Congress to apply one
to every anarchist in the country and fit it to' the
needs of his particular case. *
Wachter of Maryland has made a bid for fame "by
introducing a bill forbidding ". the cadets of West
Point and of .Annapolis to engage â¢ in football
matches; but it is easy. to see his finish.
It is noted that Croker's Democratic Club in New
York has reduced the annual ; dues from $50 to $25,
so it' seems the election must'havte hit them where it
hurts most. , "'ââ¢â  â¢ .

Domestic life In Manila, it Is said, is free
from many of the annoyances of house
keeping encountered in Europe or Amer
ica. .
For one thing,' there are no servant
troubles,' which is enough to make the
place a paradise, in the opinion of most
women from the United States, at any
rate.
The houses are not built after Western
fashions, because they wouldn't be com
fortable so. They 'are built on piles, with
a veranda around the upper floor. There
are ['- rooms '<â  all the ; way around. As the
suii moves certain apartments are left in
the shade, and the families travel around
the circuit in the day, j moving from one
room to the next, as comfort dictates. ?.
The rooms are kept clean by the house
boys.' The gardener brings whatever
water is required "' for use in the house.
The cook lives outside. . He, has his daily
orders over night, and does all of the

CLAIMS FEE DEMANDED
IS MUCH TOO LAB JE
Attorney Humphreys Says That At
torney Hassett Is Not Entitled
to Big Bemuneration.
M. C. Hassett, attorney for Public Ad
ministrator P. Boland, will not get a $2000
fee out of the estate of Elma Mabel Tay
lor if Attorney .William P. Humphreys
can prevent it. Humphreys filed a pro
test yesterday against the granting of
Hassett's claim. He says 52000 is exor
bitant and that It was never earned by
Hassett. Humphreys says in his protest
that according to a schedule of fees made
by a Superior Judge all that Hassett
could claim out of the Taylor estate,
which consists of $18,953 in cash, is $400.
Humphreys says also that Hassett, in
stead of aiding the Public Administrator,
hampered him.

IN AID OF ST. LUKE'S CHURCH
Ladies of the Ga'ifornia Club Listen to Interesting Papers Read
by Prominent Visitorsâ Daughters of Pioneers Entertain
Their Many priends With a Delightful Promenade Concert
THE assembly rooms in the base
ment of St. Luke's Church, corner
of Van Ness avenue and Clay
street, presented a lively appear-
ance last evening. -A â¢ bazaar to
aid the church ia being held there, and
the members of the exclusive set who be
long to the congregation " turned out in
force to patronize the pretty . booths.
Pursestrings were opened and articles of
every description were carried away as
souvenirs of a delightful affair, j
The bazaar Is a fixture of St. Luke's
Church. Each year, the ladles of the
church help some deserving ca'use by pre
senting articles of every description to the
committee in charge, and these articles
are placed in attractive booths and sold
to the visitors by pretty girls.
Belles who have made their bow in so
ciety and some who have just started in
the whirl of the exclusive set disposed of
fancy work, refreshments and useful ar
ticles with a a*"! that was surprising. The
beaus turned out In force. Fathers and
big brothers were there, and not one of
them left the hall until his pockets were
depleted.
The scene was a brilliant one. Beautiful
women handsomely gowned passed from
booth to booth buying articles â with a gen
erosity that bespoke prosperity for the
bazaar.
The booths presented a very attractive
appearance. They were decorated with
evergreens and bunting. Japanese lan
terns and umbrellas were used with pleas
ing effect. The lemonade booth did a
rushing business, for every one seemed
to cultivate a thirst after looking at the
large bowls containing the beverage. The
refreshment-room was filled with visitors
during the entire evening.
The bazaar will continue to-day. Three
young ladies will discourse music during
the afternoon and evening, and prominent
ladies will receive the visitors and pilot
them to the booths. The rush at some of
the booths last evening reminded one of -a
special sale at a drygoods store. The ba
zaar is a success, and it is due to the ef
forts of the officers of the Twenty Minute
Workers' Society, which is connected

wall said that the club was about to
study the subject of social science with
the view of promoting the appointment
by the State Government of women, as
sanitary and factory inspectors after the
fashion of England and many cities of
America. , .
Mrs. Jean Sinclair of Montreal, who
has traveled extensively, spoke on the
subject. She had just returned from. Lon
don, where she had made the matter of
women factory Inspectors a special study 1 .
In support of the woman inspector she
claimed that women employes could
communicate more readily with a wcrman
than with a man, and she urged that it
was more suitable for women to super
vise women; that women suffered griev
ances and had complaints to make which
they would only willingly communicate to
a woman. Both in 'France and England
the women inspectors were empowered to
take proceedings for infringement of the
law, though in France a limit to their
office was made. New Zealand â¢ had gone
farther In the matter of inspector than

REVENUE PUZZLE
STILL UNSOLVED
Telegraphic Advice From
Washington About the
' Philippines.
' Correspondence between the Treasury
Department and Customs Collectors
throughout the country is multiplying,
and ,the state of uncertainty regarding
the revenue status of* the Philippines is
widespread. Customs Collector Stratton
received yesterday from E. T. Chamber
lain, Commissioner of Navigation, the fol
lowing circular, approved by H. A. Tay
lor, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury:
1. In view of the 'recent decisions of the
Supreme Court, particularly In the cases of
Emii J. Pepke against the United States;
Christian Huus, appellant, against the New
York and Porto Rico Steamship Company;
Henry W. Dooiey agrainst the United States,
and De Lima against Bidwell, etc., collectors
of customs will no longer impose tonnage tax
on vessels from the Philippine Islands, under
the provisions of section 11 of the act of June
19, 18S6, which require the payment of tonnage
tax at each entry on all vessels which shall
be entered in any port of the United States
from any foreign port or place In North Amer
ica etc., and also at each entry upon all
vessels which shall be entered In the United
States from any other foreign ports, etc.
2. Vessels entered in the United States from
foreign ports or places via the Philippine Isl
ands, and vessels departing from the Philip
pine Islands on a voyage to the United States
and entered in the United States from inter
mediate foreign ports or places visited during
such, voyage will be subject as heretofore to
the payment of tonnage tax under the law
above cited, provided such vessels shall be
entered or cleared at the intermediate foreign
ports or places, or shall there take on board
cargo or passengers.
Several days ago Collector Stratton tel
egraphed to the Secretary of the Treasury
the following inquiry: '
Is section 4347, Revised Statutes, as amend
ed by act of February 17, 1898, operative be
tween the United States and tha Philippines?
Yesterday morning the following tele
grame was received in reply, signed As
sistant Secretary Taylor:
Hypothetical question whether section 4347,
Revised Statutes, applies to shipment between
the United States and the Philippines held In
abeyance pending further consideration by the
department of recent decision of Supreme
Court in insular cases. My yesterday's tele

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â There was a dearth
of mvrs In to-day's stock market, except such
as had to do with the personality of the opera
tors and the interests they were supposed to
represent. The well defined movements of the
day embracing the general market were limited
to the upward rush of prices at the opening
and the sudden relapse at the close. During
thÂ» greater part of ths day the market wes
rdUsciEli and irregular Ind traversed its nar
row ranee of urK-es a number of times in a
totally i.n<jcnt:equâ¬nt and dubious manner. The
owning burst of strength was thÂ« natural
momentum of yesterday's late- strong recov
er}, bclr.tcd traaers rushing to buy but it
soon became manifest that the short interest had
been much reduced by yesterday's hurried cover
ing and there vas no strong disposition mani
fested to extend commitments on the long side
The eccentric course of Amalgamated Copper
threw the . market into renewed confusion
After rising to 72%c there was open sellinp by
ths brokers whose buying . had been a s.rbni?
influence in yesterday's rally in the stock, as
they are credited with usually acting for in
side interests in Amalgamated Copper. The
consequence was that that stock commenced to
eac asain in an irregular way until it had
droppea to C9. The price then worked ite way
upward . with occasional reactions . to a high
level of 74%c, representing a recover^ of over
ten points from Saturday's low level for the
stock. There were some individual points of
strength in the general list, notably in the
Vanderbilts, with large demand for New York
Central 'and a number of less prominent rail
road and industrials, including General Elec
tric Hocking Coal, People's Gas, Consolidated
Ga3 and International Paper preferred. The
tone of the money market was much better
during the day and there s;emeda uufflcient
supply at 5>4@6 per cent, tmt late in the dav
helated borrowers caused a flurry to 8 per cent
by their unrent efforts to cover their wants,
and the stock market made an Immediate res
ponse, the whole, list dropping suddenly to the
lowest of â¢ the day on greatly increased deal
ings. Amalgamated Copper fell back to 69%
and closed with a net loss of about a point
St. Paul and Manhattan fell rapidly, the for
mer deelining 2%. There was no effectual
rally in the market and the closing was heavy
ot about the lowest. The â¢ sterling exchange
market continued depressed and there is not
much likelihood of gold exports .while money
rates hold stiff. The action of the Secretary
of the Treasury in anticipating January inter
est wa3 announced too late to help the market
to-day.
â¢The railroad bond market was Irregular, but
the price movement tended upward. â  Total
wales. iÂ»ar value. $4,110,000. 'â  United States
bonds were all unchanged on the last call, j

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10. â Extreme nervousness
and wild fluctuations characterized the grain
markets , here to-day. Wheat ruled the board
end in the fight between existing facts and
the> enthusiasm,' over uncertain futures was
badly pressed for losses. At the very start
bearish conditions piled up in an imposing
array. - Cables were weak in spite of strong
English country markets. The Northwestern
receipts,' which hihterto have shown a marked
tendency to fall oil. Increased heavily. Weath
er reports on all hands stated that the winter
crop was doing well. Both professionals and
small fry began to unload their lines and many
traders went short.' May opened Jaggedly, %"@
%c to l%<gil%c lower at 83c to 81%c. The
trade was enormous. . offerings being large.
But such low prices after yesterday's high
level tempted buyers again. Many commis
sion houses put buying orders in the pit os
tensibly from New York and St. Louis. There
was â  a rumor . current that a combination of
capitalists at Louisville : were . trying to cor
ner-wheat and that buying â¢ was for them.
With a whoop prices started up again, reach
ing S3V4.C, only to sag again to 82Vic. It was
boosted to 83 We again, but this time the flood
of selling orders and the quantity of long
wheat that poured into the market was ap
palling, and the weakening slump came. May
sold down in quick jumps to 81%," closing
weak, l%c down at 81%@Sl%c.<' .
Corn wa.s only moderately active and heavy
all session. : It followed wheat throughout.
May closed l%c down at 07%c.
Oats followed wheat and corn. May closed
%c down at 4tt%c. ' .
Provisions opened easy, but before noon
everything was above yesterday's prices un
der, the Influence of commission buying. The
close was somewhat easy and irregular, Janu

WHEAT â There was less firmness abroad,
though there was no decline. The English re
fuse to accept the American advance. - Broom
hall cabled that the average weekly European
consumption of foreign wheat for the past four
months has been 9,000,000 bushels,- against
7,000,000 last year. The Continent Is evidently
waking up to the situation, for Antwerp was
bidding for wheat at Philadelphia at an ad
vance, of 2%c. Bradstreet's gave the world's
stocks as follows: East of the Rockies, an in
crease of 5.392.00Q; Europe and afloat, a de

definitely at 02,000 bales, of which about 43,000
bales have already been shipped, leaving 10,000
or 11,000 bales in the hands of speculators and
about 8000 in the hands of growers. On Friday
forty-five carloads were shipped overland from
Portland, the largest shipment ever made.

London, consigned to the Oregon Hop Growers*

ELECTION COMMISSION
EVADES THE CHARTER
*
I
Civil Service Board Protests Against
the Transfer of Messenger An
derson to Storekeeper.
The appointment of F. A. Anderson as
storekeeper by the Board of Election
Commissioners has met with the disap
proval of the Ciril Service Commission,
which has announced its intention to pro
test against the payment of AnderÂ»on f 3
salary.
Anderson was originally employed as a
messenger, but failed to pass high enough
for certification in the examination for
the position. The Election Commission
thereupon asked permission to designate
Anderson's old position, as that of store
keeper, but the request was peremptorily
denied by the Civil Service Commission.
The last named body held that such a
proceeding would ! be a clear evasion of
the civil service provisions of the charter
and would prevent the appointment of ati
eligible as messenger.
The Election Commission then made a
requisition for eligibles for storekeeper,
and the Civil Service Commission replied
that no examination had been held for
such a position, as no classification there
for had ever been made. The former
body thereupon appointed Anderson as a
storekeeper. President Freud states that
this action was taken notwithstanding
the fact that Commissioners Kellogg,
Deasy and Greer.blatt acknowledged that
the charter was being evaded. The matter
will be called to the attention of the
Mayor, and the Election Commission may
be compelled to accept an eligible for the
place. In any event Anderson will be un
able to collect his salary as storekeeper.

PREPARES TO DIE
WITHIN A MONTH
Redding Citizen Insists
That His Days Are
Numbered. >
Makes All Arrangements for
Funeral and Settles With
Undertaker.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Dec. 10.â Peter Scherer, a
once wealthy pioneer of Redding, has se
lected his coffin at a local undertaking
establishment, arranged every detail of
his funeral, estimated the total expense
and deposited a check in bank in favor
of the undertaker. He declares that he
will die a natural death within a month.
Mr. Scherer is the divorced husband of
Mrs. Nellie McChesney Scherer, the
young woman who died in Oakland on
Saturday while under the influence of an
anesthetic, prior to an operation. They
had been separated several years and Mr.
Scherer says that his wife's unexpected
death has little to do with his case. In
1889 Mr. Scherer's first wife died. In 1892
his youngest son passed away and in 1894
his eldest son, leaving him alone. These
bereavements, together with his business
troubles, have brought him to his present
condition. . -
"I have nothing to live for and am
willing to die." said Mr. Scherer to-day.
"When one is well, has loved ones around
him and has something to work for and
look forward to, life is dear and some
thing to be fought for. I have lost all and
am ready to die. I shall die within a
month."
Scherer suffers from lung trouble and
bis condition of mind will doubtless has
ten the end. He is one of the best known
men in Shasta County and has handled
extensive business interests. He was in
apparently good health until very re
cently.
DISREPUTABLE HOUSES
ARE ORDERED CLOSED
Board of Police Commissioners Di
rects Chief Wittman to Clear
Out Bacon Place.
As a result of two communications filed
last night with the Board of Police Com
missioners, Chief of Police Wittman was
ordered to close the disreputable houses
on Bacon place.
Special Officers James Murphy and Bert
Jackson, who were recently appointed, re
signed under charges.
Police Officer Patrick J. Foley was fined
J10 for being an hour late reporting for
duty. The charge of abusing a conductor
on the Geary-street line preferred against
Officer Robert Lean was continued for
two weeks, although W. Barnett, the
complaining witness, was reported to
have left the State. Commissioners New
hall and Wallace stated they were not
satisfied that the witness had left. .
Seventeen saloon-keepers and their bar
keepers were cited to appear and explain
why they cashed checks obtained from
nickel-in-the-slot machines. The men
were arrested during the recent. raid or
dered by Chief Wittman, and each one
told his story. to the board. Before arriv
ing at a decision in the cases the question
of destroying the machines brought in by
the police as' evidence was discussed. It
developed that the statute prohibiting the
playing of these machines is explicit,
while the ordinance permits and licenses
the machines. As the statute supersedes
the ordinance, â  all machines, whether
they pay in coin or trade, will have to go.
The matter, however, will be referred to
the District Attorney for an opinion.
ORDER OF SALE OF BONDS
SURPRISES JUDGE GAGN02-T
Nebraska Jurist Inquires About the
Value of the Oppenheimer
Estate.
Superior Judge Gagnon of Richardson
County, Nebraska, has written to the Su
perior Court of this county asking for
information concerning the estate be
queathed to Ruth Oppenheimer by Inez
Oppenheimer, her mother, who died in
this city in January. 1M1.
Ruth is only 8 years of age, and Judge
Gagnon â  wants to ascertain how- wealthy
she is before fixing the bonds of her
guardian, Isham Reavis.
Ruth's mother left an estate valued at
123,000, consisting of United States bonds,
real estate and valuable jewels. She left
the bonds, which are worth $10,395, to her
daughter, as well as the jewelry.
Now her guardian wants the bonds sold,
and the fact that Judge Coffey had issued
an order directing that they be sold at
private sale became known to the Nebras
ka jurist and caused him to commence an
investigation. - '
Reavis claims that it is necessary to
sell the bonds to meet expenses, but Judge
Gagnon is of the opinion that other prop
erty should, be disposed of first, owing to
the fact that Government bonds are a
safe and good "long-time" investment.
LITTLE BOY IS BADLY
BEATEN WITH A CLUB
Charitable Society Officers State That
Child's Injuries Were Inflicted
by His Mother.
Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children states
that Charley Miller, a 7-year-old boy,
whose home is at 60 Hancock street, has,
within the last two or three days, been
frightfully beaten by his mother. The
little fellow is now at the home of his
grandmother at 19S0 Folsom street with a
broken noee. a badly cut lip and many
bruises resulting, he claims, from blows
Inflicted with a club in the hands of his
unnatural parent.
The neighbors eay that Mrs. Miller has
exhibited a brutality toward her son al
most beyond belief and that he has re
peatedly begged for their protection, but
that they dared not interfere. The case
was reported to the charitable society
and an investigation hax resulted in se
curing â¢ufficient incriminating evidence
to warrant an arrest, which the omcers
have decided to make to-day.
Mrs. Miller admits that she gave the
child a beating, but states that it was in
the way of punishment and no more than
the boy deserved. The authorities think
otherwise, however. * '
Morgan City Insurance Trial.
The plaintiff in the, suit of the La Due

the taking of testimony was concerned.
The defendant moved for a' non-suit, but
the motion was denied and the case went

fense will put in its testimony.
William Roberts, second officer of the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1901.
CHINESE FIRST,
SAYS GOMPERS
Labor Chief Advises the
Federation Now in
Session.
Declares Matter of Japanese
Excl usion Can Be
Deferred,
SCRANTON, fa., Dec. 10.â At the con
vention of the American Federation of
Labor to-day the committee having
charge of the report of the executive
council was not ready present it at the
afternoon session, andj*the reading of the
report was deferred until to-morrow.
This cleared the decks for the considera
tion of the Mongolian resolution, and the
convention immediately plunged into the
mattÂ«r.
The report of the special committee -on
exclusion was read by James O'Connell of
Washington, D. C, international presi
dent of the Machinists. It provides that
the federation use every means in its
power to have a law passed by Congress
excluding the Chinese and Japanese and
other Asiatic races. The committee was
not a unit on the report, so the conven
tion decided to separate the resolution
and consider Chinese exclusion first.
J. T. Morgan of the Federated Trades'
Council of Portland, Or.; Andrew Furuseth
of the National Seamen's Union, San
Francisco; Major Hayes, the well-known
socialist of Cleveland, and T. F. Tracey
of the Boston Cigar-makers' Union made
addresses. AH of the speakers went over
the question thoroughly. Hayes charged
that coal mine operators and iron and
steel manufacturers want to drive out the
Poles and Hungarians, who have be
come assimilated, and place in their es
tablishments the Chinese, because their
price of labor is cheaper. He further
charged that these interests and other
corporations have a powerful lobby at
work in Washington. When the question
was put to a vote there one great roar of
ayes, and the resolution was adopted.
A motion to refer the Japanese part of
the resolution to the incoming executive
council evoked a long discussion, which
was ended by the question being laid on
the table. On this section of the resolu
tion President Gompers took the floor and
made the principal speech. He said that
the convention would make a mistake if it
attempted to secure anti-Japanese legis
lation at this time. There is already a
powerful lobby at Washington, he said,
backed up by the empire of China. If the
proposed Japanese legislation is pressed It
would incur the enmity of the Japanese
Government and other interests, who
would join hands with the lobby already
at work. â¢ . â  â¢ ,
"We want to get at the cheap man, and
the Chinaman is the cheapest of all," he
v Gompers concluded by saying that the
Japanese danger does not confront the
cquntry to-day, while the Chinese does.
James O'Connell and Thomas Westoby
of San Francisco spoke along the same
lines as Gompers.

sioners appears to have met with the
general approval of the oil men. Railroad

NEGRO CLEVERLY ROBS
A MAN FROM OAKLAND
H. C. Williams of Oakland complained
to the police last night that he had been
robbed of $100 by a negro whom he had
employed to assist him in disposing of a
horse. Willams was not satisfied with
the market for choice horseflesh on the
other side of the bay, so he decided to
transport his quadruped to this side of
the water in the hope of securing a bet
ter price. On the ferry-boat he met a
negro and, impressed with his appearance,
engaged him to assist in arranging a
profitable sale.
Williams said that the negro escorted
him to a Seventh-street stable, where the
steed was Bold for $100. Happy in the
consummation of the bargain, Williams
invited . his" colored friend into a nearby
retayant to partake of lunch. What oc
curred after they entered the restaurant
Williams claims he does not know. 'He
was treated at the Central Emergency
Hospital for abrasions about the face, but
he is not aware how he came by his in
juries. He is of thÂ« opinion that the negro
drugged him and then fobbed him.

INVADERS MOVE
TOWARD PEKING
Prince Tuan Win At
tempt to Capture *
I the Capital.
Immense Army Starts for the
Conquest of Shansi
Province. "
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 10.â News'" was
brought by the Empress of India, which
arrived to-night, that the notorious
Prince Tuan and his lieutenant, i Tung-fu
Hsiang, are organizing an invasion of
China from- Mongolia . and Shensi, re
spectively, into Shansi province, with the
intention of capturing the provincial
Taiyuan. He hope3 to use that wealthy
and strong city as a base for raids into
Chili, the capture of Peking and the ex
termination of foreigners or their banish
ment from the north of China. Further,
the Prince, with a. horde of Mongols, had
then already passed Ningsia, a city on the
northernmost confines of Kansu and bor
dering the country of the Alasan . Mon
gols, marching eastward for an opening
in the great wall so as to descend south
ward into Shansi territory.
This had been denied by both.' Shensi
and Shansi officials, and. there seemed to
have been no movement either in Kansu
or Mongolia, but news has now been re
ceived by some of the local native "papers
confirming the reports of the projected In
vasion; with the addition* that Prince
Tuan and Tung-fu Hsiang have been
energetically buying all the ponies avail
able in that part of Mongolia for their
projected war of revenge against the for
eigners. The native papers have it that
horse dealers who annually supply the
southern market were unable this summer
to make their usual purchases.
In further confirmation of the news of
this activity of Tuan and Tung a Lan
chow (Kansu) correspondent reports that
not only have all the best animals in
Mongolia north of Kansu -and Shan
si provinces been bought or be
spoken on behalf of Tuan and Tung, but
their, agents have actually swept the
Shensi and Kansu markets clear of al
most all the mules.
' These mules are to be used to draw bag
gage and commissariat carts and to serve
as pack animals.
Of course Tung-fu Hsiang is the chief
paymaster in these warlike undertakings,
while Prince Tuan, through his influence,
supplies the modern arms and ammuni
tion required to arm the 100,000 additional
Mongol and Kansu levies that have
joined their standard. A Mongol Prince,
Alashan, has come forward > with half a
million taels and 20,000. horses to back the
enterprise.
Strange to say, all of these movements
have sprung into activity with the east
ward movement of the Empress Dow
ager. .

Henry Watterson Speaks
of the , Nation's
Dangers.
Famous Kentuckian Delivers
Notable Address in
. Boston. â 
-BOSTON, Dec. 10.â The Boston Mer
chants' Association met in the Vendome
Hotel this evening in celebration of its
twenty- fifth anniversary, - and â  was enter
tained by four men of national reputation;
who made spirited addresses, chiefly on
political lines. Postmaster General Smith
spoke on reciprocity; .Takahlra, the Ja
panese Minister, upon the . subject :of
"Commercial Relations"; Senator M. A.
Hanna, oh the subsidy bill, and Henry
Watterson of Kentucky, : on "Kentucky
and Massachusetts." Colonel Watterson
of Kentucky was greeted with ; three
cheers. He said, in part:
Thoughtful Americans, true to the instincts
of their manhood and their racehood. aniwer
ing the promptings of an ever-watchful pa
triotism, carrying in their hearts the prici
ples of that inspired declaration to which their
country owes its belnc as one among the na
tions of the earth, carrying in their minds the
limitations of that matchless constitution to
which their government owes its stability and
its .power, conscientious Americans, whether
they live in Massachusetts or in Kentucky,
cannot look without concern upon the peculiar
dangers that assail us as we plow through
the treacherous waters which for all our
boasted deep-sea soundings threaten to engulf
oiir shlD of state and along with it the old
fashioned lessons of economy, the simple
preachments of freedom and virtue in which
those fathers thought they laid the keel ana
raised the bulwarks of our great republic
I believe we shall prove a contradiction' to au
the bad examples of history, to all the f warn
ing voices of philosophy, to all the homely pre
cepts of that conservatism which founded on
the truest love of country yet takes no account
of the revolution wrought by modern contriv
ance upon the character and movements .-or
mankind: I believe that the American union
came among the nations , even as the Christ
came, among the sons of men.. . '..
Senator Hanna was the last speaker. He
confined his remarks entirely to the ques
tion of ship subsidy and the latest bill
for that purpose which had been present
ed to Congress. He referred to the fact
that the American nation is to-day su
preme in the agricultural and industrial
business of the world, but is at the very
lowest in regard to its merchant marine.
CLERK CLAYTON TELLS
ABOUT THE SHORTAGE
He Tries to Throw the Blame Upon
His Superior Officer, Captain
Sawtelle. :
The trial of. Charles L. Clayton for em
bezzlement was begun yesterday morning
before a jury in the United States Dis
trict Court. v
Clayton was a quartermaster's clerk on
board the transport Sheridan, and be
cause of non-attention to . his duties was
relieved from his position. When his suc
cessor came on board last summer to be
instructed by Clayton the latter went
ashore, ostensibly to get shaved. But ho
never came back. An investigation dis
closed that' there was a shortage in his
accounts of $1206 09 on May 31, and a war
rant was obtained for his arrest. He was
found several days later drunk- In the
house of a friend on Seventeenth street.
Clayton's defense is that the safe was
left unlocked and â¢ the door of the office
open one night by Captain Sawtelle, his
superior officer- on- board the Sheridan,
and that when 'Clayton examined the con
tents of the safe- next morning he found
that there, was a shortage of cash on
hand. ; > - . ; '
-Assistant United States Attorney.Ban
ning appears for the Government and
George D. Collins for the defendant. The
trial will be resumed this morning.
KERSHOW LEFT ROOMS
TO TAKE RIDE IN CAB
Testimony of Driver Shows That Col
â  legian Was Not Sick All the
Time.
Arthur J. Meadows was cross-examined
yesterday as to his knowledge of the Ker
show will. Meadows is a good witness,
however, and Attorney Rix was unable to
confuse him.
Abraham Strauss, a cabman, testified
that he frequently took Kershow out in
his' cab. Strauss was positive as to the
dates on' which Kershow rode with him.
His testimony contradicted that given by
other witnesses, who said that .Kershow
was unable to leave his room at certain
times. Strauss' note book showed that on
several of these- dates the eojleglan had
taken rides with him.
When Meadows was on the witness
stand Attorney Rix questioned him close
ly concerning his movements in Austra
lia. The lawyer sought to prove that the.
witness had embezzled $15,000 and fled to
Hongkong disguised as/ a woman. Tho
court refused to allow the Questions.

DOLE IS NOT
READY TO GO
Hawaii's Governor Has !
No Indention of Re
signing.
Findings in the Case of Cap
tain Tilley Are 'Made
Public.
HONOLULU, H. T., Dec. 3.â Governor
Dole has given out another statement
in an interview that he has no 'intention
of resigning. Last night at the meeting
of the Republican Central Committee a
resolution was brought up to make a se
lection of a successor in the event of a
vacancy occurring in the office. '.It was
the opinion of some of the member's that
Dole had resigned or would resign with
out notifying the committee and would
recommend a successor, and the resolu
tion â¢was to have been addressed to the
national committeeman of the Republi
can party for Hawaii, asking him to use
hia efforts to see that the party commit
tee here was given a voice in the choice
of a successor. : - . J
The resolution was postponed for con
sideration to-night. When the commit
tee meets it will have before it the Gov
ernor's statement that he has no inten
tion of . resigning.
The findings of the court-martial which
tried Captain Tilley, ex-Governor of Tu
tuila, have been made public, completely
exonerating the captain. The findings
were posted on board the battleship Wis
consin just before she left Pago Pago.
The case against Tilley collapsed alto
gether in court. The members of the
court report great difficulty in securing
the attendance of witnesses desired.
United States Consul Osborne was one,
but he died just before the court con
vened. His" son refused to attend. Other
civilian witnesses also refused to answer
the court's call for their testimony, and
some of the members of the court think
legal provision should be made to give
courts-martial power to compel the at
tendance of all witnesses wanted.
The battleship Wisconsin is in port
here, having arrived from Pago Pago on
December 1. She has on board Admiral
Casey and other members of the Tilley
court-rmartial, which held sessions ' at
Pago Pago. The Wisconsin is coaling
outside the harbor, as did the Oregon. It
Is stated that she intended to come in,
but the officers did not want to allow
the men on shore here. She will take
1000 tons of coal and leave in about a
week for Acapulco, Mexico.
Judge Estee this morning gave a deci
sion in the suit of the Hawaiian Tram
ways Company of London against the
Honolulu Rapid Transit Company. The
suit was a proceeding brought by the
tramways company to secure an injunc
tion restraining the new electric roa-1
from extending its lines along Kh.^
street, where the old company claims an
exclusive franchise. Estee decided that
a "former decision of the Supreme Court
of Hawaii in favor of the Rapid Transit
Company holds good.
The diocesan synod of the Anglican
church of Hawaii is now in session. The
most important business is completing
the arrangements for Americanizing the
church, as provided for by the resolution
passed at the general convention in San
Francisco, admitting the church to the
American body. Bishop Willis, the retir
ing head of the church, delivered an an
nual address,, in which he severely criti
cized the so-called "second congregation."
which has kept up the long fight against
his methods of church government and
maintenance of the British authority.
The Star says: Mainland newspapers
across the continent from San Francisco
contain the statement in various forms
that ex-Queen Liliuokalani has refused
the money appropriated for her by the
last Legislature, as she objects to its ap
pearance of "charity." The appropriation,
however, has not been rejected, but is be
ing regularly -collected* from the treasury
of Hawaii by the ex-Queen's agents. It
is 515,000 for the present fiscal period of
two years and amounts to $625 a month,
which sum has been duly paid over since
the appropriation began to run.

TWO "WOMEN FIGHT OVER
' POSSESSION OF A PLUME
Mrs. Mary da Laveaga Is Arrested on
a Charge of Petty Lar
ceny.
Miss Maria Cassasa, milliner. 1727 Stock- !
ton street, secured a warrant from Judge !
Mogan yesterday for the arrest of Mrs. I
Mary deL^veaga, 1812 Filbert street, on i
a charge' of petty larceny. Mrs. Laveaga, ;
learning that the warrant , was out, sur
rendered herself at the Hall of Justice
and was released on bail. *
Mis$ Cassasa sold ' a hat to Mrs. de
Laveaga, and Sunday afternoon they met
on the street. "She accused me," said
Mfss Cassasa, "of putting a cheap plume
in her hat, and said the plume I had in
my hat was the one that should have been,
in hers. I told her it was not true, and
sha called me names and struck me. She !
said she would have my plume; and strug- |
gled with me till she. succeeded in pullinp i
it out of my hat. Then she walked away !
with the plume." i
Miss Cassasa wanted Mrs. de I>aveaga |
charged ' with grand larceny, as she had [
forcibly taken the plume, but the Judgo.
thought the minor charge would cover the
case. ' ' - â  â  â  â¢ * -

ELECTRIC LIGHT
WIRE IS TAPPED
Serious Charge Is Made
Against Ignatz Beck,
a Pharmacist.
He Is Accused of Swindling
Corporation by Using
an Extra Line.
Ignatz Beck is the proprietor of a phar
macy at 1348 Ellis street, which is greatly,
admired by the neighborhood because of
its brilliant lighting at night. There are
thirty electric lights burning in the store,
which are supplied by the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company. ,
As, Beck's bills were very, small for the!
quantity of light furnished, an investiga
tion was made, and on July 23 last the
suspicion arose that Beck had "tapped"
the wires of the company. The investiga
tion was carried on until it was discov
ered, so it Is alleged, that Beck had made
connection with the wires of the company
and that twenty of the lights used were
surreptitiously supplied. The power used
was not registered at the meter.
Colonel E.F. Preston, attorney for the
company, accompanied by Seth Cohen, an
employe of the company, called at the
bond and warrant clerk's office yesterday
and Cohen swore to a complaint in Judge
Fritz's court charging Beck with willfully
and unlawfully connecting % a wire with
the apparatus of the electric company.
" The action is taken under a .recent addi
tion to the Penal Code relating to electrfc
light companies, and is the first one of the
kind on record. . .

TELLS THE JURY
OF THE KILLING
Mrs. Coarum Describes
the Struggle With
Man She Slew.
The taking: of testimony In the case of
SCts. Coarum, charged with murder, was
completed In Judge Dunne's court yester
day, and Assistant District Attorney
Ore&ny made his opening argument to the
Jury. ,
Mrs. Coarum was the last witness to
testify. She testified that she knew Dan
iels a number of years and was quite in
timate with him. "I tried to get rid of
elm a number of times," said she, "but
he persisted In seeking my company. A
few days before the shooting took place
â we quarreled and 1 told him. I would not
eee him any more. My husband was due
to arrive in the city almost any day and
1 was afraid there would be trouble. On
Easter Sunday, two days before I shot
him, he came to my house and forced
his way in. He was in an ugly mood,
and when I left the house to evade him
he followed me.
"We quarreled and kept it up until the
following day. Tuesday. April 9, he came
to the house in the afternoon. I left the
house again to escape him. I went down
town, and on my way back I stopped at
a pawnbroker's and exchanged a small
pistol I had for a larger one. I kept a
pistol for self-protection. I changred the
old one that day because Daniels told me
it was no eood.
"He came to the house again that night
and asked for some supper. I prepared
a meal and after we had eaten it he went
out and got some beer and whisky. When
he came back he began to quarrel with
me. He drew a razor out of his pocket,
commenced to strop it on his boot and
said he could cut me to pieces with it.
He taunted me about my marriage to a
colored man, and said he would slash
my face so that the 'nigger* would not
know me.
"He then grabbed me an( j started to drae
me toward the stairs. I resisted, and as
we struggled I began to fear that he
â¢would kill me. I remember shooting at
him once. I know nothing of what oc
curred after I fired one shot. The next
recollection I have is when the police
officers came in and arrested me."
The case will be submitted to the jury
to-day.

The Victor
Uses Discs
â Â»^
The Victor Talking Machine uses
flat, indestructible disc records,
made; from: a hard" composition
that practically preserves the record,
though it be used time and again.
Being flat, the records require but
little roomâ 57 seven-inch records
occupy the same space as five small
wax cylinders.
The Victor's records bear a gold
label with the name of the selection
and its performer marked plainly.
The success attained by The Victor
and its records won for it the gold
medal over all other talking ma-
chines at the Pan-American Exposi-
tion.
This proves that the flat disc pro-
cess is^ the only way of faithfully re-
producing all tone qualities.

ber of entertaining records. If out

ERRATIC WOMAN
PUZZLES COURT
Lady Yarde-Buller Makes
Some Rather Astonish
ing Answers.
"Remember, Ralph, you are the son of
a British officer. Tell the truth."
Thus spoke Lady Yarde-Buller to her
son yesterday in Judge Hebbard's court.
The young man was on the witness
stand, telling what he knew about A. A.
Baroteau, who is suing the titled woman
for $3000 alleged to be due him for serv
ices he rendered.
Baroteau holds a note for - the amount
signed by Lady Yarde-Buller. She is per
fectly willing" to pay it, but her guardian;
George T. Wright, is not so willing,
hence the suit.
The once talented woman, whose beauty
years ago -was talked of from '.Maine to
Caatorma and even across tne '^Atlantic,
appeared in Judge Hebbard's court yes
terday morning attired in black. She is
Etill a handsome woman, out time and
tne remarkable career she has lived have
left their marks. She evidently is not of
sound mind, judging trom her actions and
speech, but she is a remarkable woman
still.
Several times during the course of the
trial she interrupted the proceedings by
talking to the Judge, the lawyers and the
witnesses â¢ and appeared to be on the
verge of hysterics.
When she was called as a witness she
walked up' the steps leading to the wit
ness stand, solemnly took the oath and
gave her name as- "Marie Leila Delilah
Kirkham Yarde-Buller."
Admits Services Were Rendered.
"Are j'ou the defendant in this case?"
she was asked.
"I don't know," she replied. "I don't
know what I am here for.'*
"Has Mr. Baroteau ever rendered you
any service?" was the next question.
The witness replied that he had an-1
that the services were many and varied.
"What were they?"
"Oh, you ask me too much," said
Mrs. Yarde-Buller. "When I think of
what that man has done for me I would
not be in his place for millions."
"Do you approve of his claim?"
"I do; indeed I do. Oh, why are not
my famous lawyers and guardians- here
to help me out? Where are they?"
Seeing that the lady was getting ex
cited the lawyers ceased questioning her.
When they told her that "that was all"
she arose and addressing the Judge said:
"Oh, sir, where are my Portland bonds?
Where is my stock in the Bank of Cali
fornia? What is to become of a poor
woman when she is defended by so many
gentlemen?"
When Baroteau was testifying she in
terrupted him frequently. He finally man
aged to tell his story, which was to the
effect that he had acted as the lady's
bodyguard for a year. He went every
where with her, he said. "I was," said
Barotean, "at her beck and call at all
times. I escorted her to the theater,
park, cemetery and many other places."
The defendant interrupted him at this
point by saying:
Sons Object to the Claim.
"They've been robbing my estate for
years. They'd have me starve to death
in the gutter so that they could get it all
for themselves. Now they won't pay this
poor man who has done so much for me "
Ralph K. Blair and Arthur K. Blair,
sons of Yarde-Buller, were also witnesses
in the case. They told of Barotean's at
tentions to their mother, and said they did
everything in their power to keep him
away from her. Ralph, the elder, said he
even went so far as to threaten to thrash
Baroteau if he did not quit hanging
around the lady.
At this point the cause of all the trou
ble rose majestically to her feet and ad
dressing the young man said:
. "Remember, Ralph, you are the son of
a British officer. Tell the truth."
She informed Judge Hebbard that she
was a British subject, that English law."
would not allow her to be treated in such
a manner, and closed her speech by re
marking scornfully: â .;-â¢. :::
"I don't understand your courts."
Judge Hebbard did not decide, the case
yesterday, though he intimated that he
would give a decision in favor of Baro
teau for a portion if not the entire sum.
He also intimated that he did not like the
idea. of a man taking a note from a wom
an in Lady Yarde-Buller"s condition.

EXPERTS GOING
OVER THE BOOKS
Final Steps Toward Sale
of Market-Street
Railway. -
New Owners Will Assume
Complete Control in
February.
,The final steps for the transfer of the
Market Street Railway Company's prop
erty to the Baltimore syndicate are being
taken. Expert bookkeepers and account
ants from New York are going over the
books and the new owijers will assume
complete control about the middle of
February.
â  With the new ownership a number of
changes will take place in the workings
of the Southern Pacific Company. One of
the first moves made by the Baltimore
syndicate will be to institute its own
claims department. At the present time
the claims department of I the Southern
Pacific and the Market Street Railway
Companies are one. The claims depart
ment is under the immediate supervision
of Chief Counsel W. P. Herrhi. The
claims agent is Charles B. Sessions, who
reports to Mr. Herrin on all matters.
It is certain that the Southern Pacific
Company will want Attorney Sessions to
remain in his position, and he will, In
forming his new claims department, ask
a number of his most valued clerks to re
main with him. ....
Whom the Baltimore syndicate will name
as Its chief counsel, and. who will preside
over its law and claims departments, is
not at present known. It is. presumed,
however, that they will bring out from
Baltimore more than one attorney to as
sist in the legal business. In the mean
time a number of attorneys in town are
trying to find out how they can secure
positions with the new syndicate.
When the Baltimore syndicate secures
final possession of the Market street road
it is said there will be a number of
changes. It is predicted that within a
year there will be an "all night" car ser
vice on several of the electric roads, vrhe
Baltimore syndicate â  ia composed of
wealthy capitalists in the East, but they
vill not reside here, simply having repre
sentatives in this city to look after their
interests.

Severe Illness.
Dr. Charles A. Clinton was stricken
with a severe chill while at dinner at his
home, on' Howard and Twenty-first

Though feeling the results of the chill
all Saturday, Dr. Clinton would not ap
preciate the seriousness of his condition
uiiui Sunday, when Drs. Wymore and
Perry were called in to attend' the patient.
At first typhoid fever was feared by the
attending physicians, but the patient re
sponded to treatment and his case is now
pronounced to be one of severe grip. Last

LARGER MAINS
FOR BELMONT
Spring Valley Company
Is Making Extensive
Improvements.
Daily Water Supply of City
Will Be ; Largely In
creased.
The Spring â¢ Valley Water Company is
making extensive additions to its pump
ing plant at Belmont by which the daily
capacity of water pumped to this city
via Millbrae will be increased from 10,
000,000. to 15,000,000 gallons. The cost of
the improvement now being made â  will
exceed $300,000. j)
During the last three weeks a contract
has been let to the Jjaidlaw-Dunn-Gordan
Company of Cincinnati for th/ee engines,
each of 4,000,000 gallons capacity for every
twenty-four hours. The cost of the en
gines reaches nearly $70,000. The engines
are now in course of manufacture, and
it is expected will be in transit for this
city within the next four weeks.
The laying of larger mains from the
Belmont station to Dunbarton Point in
Alameda County has been in progress
tor some time under the supervision of
Engineer Schussler. About ten days since
Mr. Schussler met with an accident while
driving â¢ in Oakland, receiving injuries to
his knees which now confine him to his
home at 1905 Van Ness avenue. Efforts
made to see Mr. Schussler last night were
unavailing. President Charles Webb How
ard in the course of an interview said:
It is true the Spring Valley Comoany is
making extensive enlargements of its Belmont
plant. We have had two 11- inch water mains
in use at the plant for some years, and the
need of increasing our capacity has long beea
urgent. We then began the laying of two 22
inch mains across the bay to Dunbarton Point,
a distance of 6400 feet. These tubes are of the
best quality, and especially prepared for the
purpose to which they are devoted. We expect
to . have the works completed in about two
months and to have the entire Increased plant
in operation within the coming four months.
There is no especial significance about this im
provement. We are constantly increasing our
capacity everywhere, and as much of San
Francisco's waler supply comes from our Bel
mont station it was directly in line. These two
extra mains will give us an increased capacity
of 5,000,000 gallons a day. I do not know the
precise cost of the improvement/but it will be
considerable.
The directors of the company will visit
the scene of the operations to-morrow or
Friday. The method of laying the large
mains across the bay to Dunbarton
Point wili be inspected. The tubes are
laid on the bottom of the bay with ball
and socket joints, the whole forming a
delicate piece of work. The two mains
converge into a S6-inch main, through
which the water is pumped toward San
Francisco. , â¢â¢â â 'â .â -'
Sick Children Receive Good Care.
Mrs. J. R. Hanify, secretary of the Cal
ifornia Club, stated at a meeting of the
club yesterday that it was . generally sup
posed in San Francisco that the children
of the; poor suffering , from a contagious
disease would not be admitted into a hos
pital. ' Miss -Patton, superintendent of
nurses of the City and County Hospital,
has informed . the California Club that
they have rooms for poor children In
special buildings, where they, are well
cared for by a doctor and nurses. The
announcement by Mrs. Hanify was made
to rectify a report recently made to the
club.
Violates the Barber Law.
Frank L. Grcenberg, proprietor of the
Safe Deposit barber shop, Montgomery
street, was arrested on a warrant charg
ing him with violating the new barber
law. He was released on bail. The com
plaining witness is J. J. Calish, Barber
Commissioner, who alleges that Green
berg .refuses to display his certificate in
a place in his shop where it can be seen.
DIRECT LINES
TO SANTA ROSA
Two Sets of Survey ors
Are Tracing the
Routes.
Stakes of Southern Pacific
Indicate Terminal at
McNears.
. Surveys for a railroad from McNears
Landing or California City on the bay of
San Francisco to Santa Rosa -via Peta
luma and San Rafael signify,, important
developments of the country immediately
north of this city. There are two surveys
being made. One Is for an electric road
from Santa Rosa to Sausalito and the
other for a Southern Pacific line follow
ing the California . Northwestern / road
from Santa Rosa to a point one mile
from San Rafael, whence the line runs
across to McNears Landing. The elec
tric , line surveyors are keeping to . the
county road and their staKes run from
San kafaei to Petal uma. ,
There is an impression among men who
are largely interested in Sonoma and
Marln counties that the Southern Paciiio
is making a feint in order to get control
by purchase or lease of the California
Northwestern Hallway, but it is the Judg
ment of practical railroad men that the
freight and passenger, traffic available
will tully justily the construction of an
independent, direct route, even .if the
new line shall parallel for some distance
the road of which Colonel A. "W. Foster
is president, and which now constitutes
the only direct line between San Fran
cisco, Petaluma, Santa Rosa, Cloverdale
and Healdsburp. . - j
The prospect of great 'activity in the
projection and construction of electric
lines for carrying passengers may have
spurred the steam railway companies to
energetic consideration of future require
ments. There is certainly a big and
promising field for railway extension in
the section commonly known as North
ern California. Electric lines may con
tribute largely to the new development.
Observant railway men incline to tho
opinion that the first steps in the con
struction of a great electric system to
bring the urban and suburban districts
close together will be taken on the
peninsula of San Francisco by the ex
tension of the electric line to San Jose
and be followed by the further construc
tion of a line from the Santa Clara Val
ley to Oakland. The Southern Pacific
managers, apprehending competition of
this kind, and knowing by experience
gained in Los Angeles that electric roads
can divert steam railway travel, are pre
paring to shorten the time and the dis
tance between the metropolis and the
valley of Santa Clara.
I Electric railways connecting country
villages with towns and extending from
town, to town to important cities havÂ«j
given the old line railway corporations of
the East something to consider. By trans
ferring from one electric line to another
one can easily go from Boston to Spring
field by the trolley lines. The extensions
in progress will soon enable travelers to
journey on roads of this kind from Boston
to New York. In fact. It is claimed that
the journey can now be made on electric
car lines from one city to the other.
Eastern capital in vast sums is coming
to California for investment, and it would
not surprise practical men if large sums
should - be expended in the development
of a system of electric lines to bring the
cities and towns of Sonoma and Napa
counties into close relations with the
chief city; of the State. .
The ample deep water facilities at Mc-
Nears Landing will doubtless be utilized
by the promoters of the "new. steam rail
way from Santa Rosa to the bay. It Is
estimated that the ferry-boat can make
the run from McNears to San Francisco
in; forty-five minutes. â¢â¢ â  â

STILL FIGHTING
FOR SUTRD GOLD
Alleged Widow of De
ceased Capitalist Piles
New Suit.
Clara Kluge Sutro la determined to get
a share of the" estate of Adolph Sutro.
who she claims was her husband and
the father of her two children.
"When the Sutro will was filed for pro
bate, a short time after the death of the
aged capitalist, she commenced her battle
for recognition and wealth by contesting
tho will, claiming that she was his wife
and entitled to a share of the estate. The
case is still pending. It was rumored a
short time ago that it would 1 never be
tried, as a compromise of some sort had
been effected. That there was no truth
in the rumor is. shown by the tiling yes
terday of a second contest.
This time the plaintiff is contesting the
will on behalf of her children, whom she
names in the complaint as Adolph Newton
Sutro and Adolphine Charlotte Sutro.
Clara Kluge Sutro in the complaint filed
yesterday alleges that she is the wife of
Adolph Sutro and that he is the. father
of her little boy and girl. She alleges
further that there Is another will in ex
istence besides the one dated May 22. 1S82,
which was offered for probate. She also
alleges that this, other will, executed, she
claims, In the year 1S95, makes
her and tho two children beneficiaries.
She claims that she does not know where
the document is, and that a proper search
was wot made for it. The last will, which
she alleges is the document which should
be offered for probate, has either been
lost, concealed or destroyed.
COT7BT SETS ASIDE SATYF,
OF EMERY'S SECURITIES
Decides That Bartlett Doe Was Not
the Highest Bidder for the
Property.
Superior Judgo Hebbard decided yester
day morning that the sale of securities
which Bartlett Doe- holds In pledge for
money loaned to J. S. Emery is invalid.
The suit was brought by Emery . to set
aside the sale, for an accounting' and to
declare a trust. The court based its de
cision on the- grounds that Bartlett Doe
was not the highest bidder, and . that
Charles F. Doe failed to make good the
amount of his bid. By reason of Emery's
default, title to the securities did not pass
to Doe, and it is a question whether
Bartlett Doe does not hold the balance of
$14,000 in trust for Emery.
The suit in the first instance srrew out
of a debt of $47,000 upon two promissory
notes which J. S. Emery owed to Bartlett
Doe. The notes were secured by certain
bonds and securities which Emery depos
ited with Doe. Bartlett Doe notified
Emery that on a certain - date his securi
ties would be disposed of at a public auc
tion Â£ale. At this sale, which was at
tended by JV S. Emery, Bartlett Doe and
Charles F. Doe, Bartlett Doe b.o. $47 000
for the securities, but his brother, Charles
F. Doe, bid $52,350, and at that figure thev
were sold to him. The successful bidder
advanced his check for $47,000. but he neg
lected to pay. over the $5000 balance.
Charles F. Doe's check was finally re
turned to him, and Bartlett Doe continued
in possession of the property, eventually
disposing of it for $61,750.
