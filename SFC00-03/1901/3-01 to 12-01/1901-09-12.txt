"The prosecution will take the usual

- "Yes. Czolgosz was tortured. He was
given rigorous treatment, and it is prob

has not told all that he knows. This is a
peculiar case and it demands peculiar
treatment. I believe that the public will
uphold us in using force to bring the en

Superintendent Bull added:
"It has been previously beyond any
one's denial that a number of known an
archists, including Emma Goldman, met
by prearrangement In Buffalo and talked
with Czolgosz at different Â¦ times a very
short time before the effort was made on
the President's life.
"It Is known that others had. fore
knowledge of the intention of Czolgosz to
assassinate President McKinley."
Czolgosz is in a filthy condition, having
been neither shaved nor washed since his
arrest. His guards refuse . to reply -to
questions, and the assassin thinks the
President is dead. .

BUFFALO, Sept 11â It is not de
nied by the police of Buffalo,
except In a perfunctory manner,
that Czolgosz has been tortured
since his arrest. There axe not
many In this"* country who will
protest against the use of the famous
"third degree" in this case. The confes
sion, which Is now In the hands of Dis
trict Attorney Penney, was forced from
Czolgosz by torture.
When the would-be assassin of the
President was first taken before Superin
tendent Bull he was asked to tell how
he came to make an attack upon Presi
dent McKinley.
"I will not talk/' said Czolgosz. "I will
not say a word." .
Superintendent Bull looked at the pris
oner, then turning to two stalwart guards
who had brought him in, said: "Take him
away."
It is not known that any sign was given.
Neither Is It known that the policemen
had any authority for their strenuous ac

brought before Superintendent Bull he
was glad to- confess. ;

BUFFALO, Sept. 11.â Many persons as
sumed just after the attack on the Presi
dent that as he would at least be pre
vented from discharging the duties of his
office for a period of several ' weeks and
perhaps months it would necessitate call
ing upon Vice President Roosevelt to act
in his place until he had recovered.
Members of the Cabinet never had any
Idea that the Vice.- President would be
called upon, excepting in the case of the
death of the President or his permanent
inability to act.
Secretaries Root, Hay, Hitchcock and
Wilson met yesterday morning in the Mil
burn house and after remaining together
for an hour adjourned to" the Sprague
residence, which .is near at hand, .for
lunch. They remained there until nearly
3 o'clock before, making another call at
the Milburn house. They discussed
thoroughly the situation as it exists and
various matters of state which require
attention in several- departments of the
Government. They agree that it- would
be useless for them to remain in this
city, especially in view of the fact that
the' physicians haye asserted that-abso
lute quiet is necessary- for - the Presi
dent's recovery, and that he will not be
able to discuss administration affairs for
two or three weeks at least. It is under
stood that the President has Indicated
that he would feel easier If he knew his
Secretaries were in Washington.

CHICAGO, Sept. 11.â While city officials
are having their own troubles concerning
the disposition of Emma Goldman and the
probability of the Buffalo authorities be
ing able to take the woman off their
hands within the next twenty-four hours,
the Federal authorities in Chicago are
also considerably worried about her.
It is known that to-day a long cipher
dispatch was received here, coming it is
said direct from Attorney General Knox
and giving an opinion concerning the
right of the to hold her un
der .the present Federal statutes which is
the reverse of satisfactory. It is believed
that the Federal officers are not by any
means Â¦ certain that she can be kept in
custody by. them on any- charge whatever.

another bed. -A depression .had. formed
in the mattress on which he had lain since
he was taken to the Mllburn house and

bed was provided, and â¢. this evening he
was carefully moved from one to the

several times if there was any news which
he should know, but inquiries, especially
about public matters, are discouraged,
and the rigid inhibition against the ad
mission of any one except his wife and
faithful secretary has not been relaxed.
It is now virtually decided 'that no at
tempt will be made to remove the Presi
dent to Washington until he has com
pletely recovered, and in a general way Jt
can be said that there is no likelihood
that this will be before October. The phy

"Usually we gel a large number of let

we did not get even any crank letters be
fore the President went to Buffalo. We
Investigate practically all the warnings
and intimations that come here, no mat
ter how convinced we may be that they

Chief Wilkie said to-day that so far he
had not secured any evidence tending to
show that the anarchist bodies at Pater

at â¢ their request and that they have no
idea of proceeding against her unless di

so, or unless they secure testimony show-

An anonymous letter is in the posses

writer, whose mind has, evidently been in

the President as a tool of trusts, declares
that. if he survives the bullets of Czol

kill the President is being followed out,
and if the writer of the letter can be as
certained through the medium of post
marks or In any other way he will be
arrested. , '
The authorities are already in possession
of evidence pointing in this direction, but
there is nothing yet to indicate who the
men are who are to make the next at

archists now under arrest may reveal a
substantial clew. .. ..-?
The police made public what they said

WASHINGTON, Sept 11.â The Depart
ment of Justice has not decided upon any
steps to secure possession of Emma Gold
man for the purpose of taking action
against, her in the Federal courts. She
was arrested by the Chicago police on the
request of the Buffalo authorities and
It Ss supposed by the Department of Jus

State. The belief is that the Governor
No Steps to Secure Woman.
Miss Goldman was represented by Law
yers Brown, Gectlng and Saltiel. They
were busy in the habeas corpus case dur
ing the forenoon, but interviewed their
client in time to apear for her in the hear
ing in the matter of bail. . . . - . Â¦
He said it would not- be necessary for
counsel to apply for a writ for Miss Gold
man, as he would deal exactly with Miss
Goldman as Judge Chetlain did with the
other prisoners.
Counsel contended that none of these
constitutional requirements had been
complied with in the case of Miss Gold
man. As the charge against Miss Gold
man, "conspiracy to murder President
McKinley." is the one- lodged against the
local anarchists who are named as co
conspirators with Miss Goldman. Magis
trate Prindiville thought it wise to await
the decision of the higher court.
"This matter must be disposed of ac
cording to the well-known rules of law.
Where a. party Is brought into court
charged with any criminal offense that
party has a risht io an immediate hear
ing. Section 7, article 2, of the constitu
tion of Illinois declares that all persons
shall be bailable by sulJicient sureties ex
cept for capital offense where the proof
is evident and presumption great. When
a person is brought into court on a
charge, even though it be a. capital one,
it would be bailable urt!ess there was
some evidence given before the court to
show that the proof was evident and the
presumption sreat. Otherwise the consti
tution would not say that all offenses are
bailable 'except' â where there is an ex
ception to the general clause there it de
volves upon the prosecution to prove the
exception. In this case the affidavit filed
here does not -rronform with the law, be
cause the law oemands an oral examina
tion, the affidavit to be based on that oral
examination. It should be upon personal
knowledge aÂ» to the facts. Judge Free
man holds that very distinctly in the
case of White vs. Wagner, in the eighty
third Appellate Court of Illinois, follow
ing the Lipnian case in 1875. Judge Cart
wright said in the Lipman case that our
constitution provides that no warrant
Ehall issue except for probable cause sup
ported by affidavits in the provision to
guard against official abuse, and that no
person should be brought into court sim
ply on /the opinion or. unfounded state
ment of any person, but the facts must
be exhibited in the complaint to. give the
court jurisdiction."
Requirements Not Met.
Lawyer Geetlng, in pleading for the
prisoner, said: Â»
Pleads for the Prisoner.
"While this morning I was Inclined to
believe that the defendant might be en
titled to bail, considering the condition
that the President is now in. yet, at. that
time, of course, I did not know that there
was any proceeding pending or that it
wag going to be taken to a higher court.
Of course, this present defendant is in
charge just the same as all the rest of
them. She is charged Jointly with con
spiracy. Of course, it being taken to a
higher court and a superior court, I do
not feel as if I should now take any ac
tion which might be contrary to the deci
sion that would be arrived at by the up
per court or that would in any way influ
ence the court in the matter there pend
ing. That being the case feeling as I do,
and with the understanding that I had.
with the counsel this morning that if
Judge Chetlain admitted the other de
fendants to bail I would do the same, I
still say that I will remand this defend
ant, and if Judge Chetlain at 11 o'clock
Friday morning admits these prisoners to
bail I will immediately send for Miss
Goldman, or at whatever time I hear of
it, and will do the same thing; that is, 1
will admit her to bail the same as the
upper court."
Will Abide by Decision.
Miss Goldman appeared for a hearing
before the magistrate during the fore
noon. She had not secured counsel, but in
a determined voice declared that she was
ready to act as her own attorney. The
Assistant City Prosecutor, however, ob
taineTL a continuance of the hearing till
September 13, the date set for the iiearing
of the other anarchists in custody here.
Mr. Owens, the prosecutor, stated thai
the result of an investigation at Buffalo
was being awaited. In deciding the case,
the court said:
The action of Justice Prindiville in hold
ing her without bail extends only to Fri
day of this week. On that day the ques
tion will be reconsidered and the magis
trate will decide whether she shall be
held without bail or released under bonds
until the preliminary hearing of the

â¢ Dr. Park also expressed his satisfaction
at the condition shown by the President
and at the manner in which .his system
was responding to treatment. All the
members nf the Cabinet now in the city,
including Secretaries Root, Wilson, Hitch
cock and Postmaster General Smith, were
again at the Mllburn mansion to-night,
and remained until after the consultation
of the physicians was concluded. They
are highly elated over the favorable de
velopments in the President's case, and
Secretary Root is so sanguine of the fu
ture that he has determined to leave the
city, to-morrow. He will take 1
o'clock train for New York.
Dr. Mann, who has attended every con
sultation of the. physicians, was not pres
ent to-night, feeling that his attendance
was unnecessary. .' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ ...
The examination was simply a way of
testing the conditions of the President's
blood. - Â¦ . ' . .
The doctor will remain overnight "and
attend the. consultation of the physicians
to-morrow. The time of his departure has
not been determined.
Dr. McBurney remained in the house
awhile longer than the other physicians,
leaving shortly after 11 o'clock. He con
firmed the statement made in the bulletin
to the effect that the examination of the
President's blood showed no evidence of
blood poisoning, nor did it, he added;
show any sign of peritonitis. While the
examination of the blood was not made to
determine the latter fact, yet it would
unmistakably have shown* it had there
been peritonitis.
Confirmed by McBurney.
"Not a particle. Pus means the exist
ence of an abscess, and there is not the
suggestion of pus about the President's
body."
The bulletin which followed Dr. Was
din's statement officially confirmed what
he had said.
"No, I would not say that; he is a very
sick man, but his condition under the cir
cumstances could not be better. That
much I will say emphatically."
"Was any trace of pus found in the ex
terior wound?"
"Is the President out of danger?"
"The count . was not made," continued
Dr.'Wasdin, "to verify the fact that blood
poisoning did not exist, of which we felt
certain, but to remove every shadow of
doubt. The* result is: that 'we feel safe
in announcing that not a,, trace- of blood
poisoning exists. The test could not have
been more satisfactory."
"We found," he said, "that the number
of white corpuscles was just, about nor
mal, while the red cells were slightly be
low-normal, 1 due to insufficient nutrition
since the operation'." â¢ 'â¢' . - '

ing."'.- .? . â¢Â¦ -Â¦Â¦ . â¢'"' .
. Me referred the reporters to Dr. Wasdin
of the -Marine Hospital Service,- who was
standing at his side, for a scientific in
terpretation. The latter explained that a
count of the blood was a microscopic ex
amination of the relative number or white
and red corpuscles in the blood to deter
mine- whether inflammation of any sort
existed. An increase of white corpuscles,
relatively speaking, would show inflam
mation and deterioration of the blood that
might' indicate peritonitis.
"Is he still improving?"'
The physicians did not begin to leave
the Miidurn residence until shortly before
11 o'clock. The reports which they had to
communicate could hardly have been more
gratifying than they. were. Dr. Wasdin
and . Dr. Mynter came out together. The
latter was hemmed in on all sides by the
eager newspaper men.
"Good news!' Good news!" he cried.
"Nothing, but good news. We have
washed and fed the President and moved
him to another bed."
..At the conclusion of the night confer
ence the doctors gave another extremely
gratifying report of their patient's prog
ress.
"Good News," Cries Doctor.
The members of the Cabinet were all
below stairs while the consultation was in
progress and remained until after the bul
letin was prepared and issued. They were
so elated over the improvement in the
President's condition and the absence of
any unfavorable symptoms that Secretary
Root announced that he felt free to de
part and that he had decided to go to
New York to-morrow.

strike benefits during the day and would
have them all out during the week. The
number to receive benefits is not more
than 10.000 and this will require about $40.
000 weekly. It Is stated that the Amalga
mated treasury, reimbursed by the lodges
whose members are at work, will be able
to meet the payments with the aid of
funds contributed by sympathizers.
The officials of the same company
showed even greater activity about the
Star mills. About 11 o'clock in the morn
ing a car containing about sixty skilled
men for the Star plant arrived in the un
ion station. These men were taken to the
plant without any interference from the
strikers. The recruits came from the
East and it is said many of them had
broken away from the ranks of the strik
ers in other, mills.
While the president of the Amalgamated
Association was standing in this position,
the officials of the United States Steel
Corporation were putting forth active ef
forts to start their- plants. During to-day
the company held strikers* pickets back
and got a lot of provisions and cots into
the Monongahela mills. It was announced
at the same time that there was an ample
number of men ready to enter the plant
and start the mills as soon as they were
in readiness.

worthy that the official statement made at

President Jordan, when asked to-day* re
garding the interview in Denver on Chi

as the coast newspapers seem, to under
stand, that he had declared his opposition
10 the Chinese exclusion act or that he
has expressed the belief that married Chi

has many advocates in Hawaii, and, in

the Supreme Court of Venezuela will com
mence consideration next Monday of the
merits of the controversy between the
New York and Bermudez Asphalt' Com

relative to the ownership of the Bermudez
asphalt lakes. There has been no change
in the determination of the administra

turns its verdict. It may be. however,
that while judicial proceedings are in
progress the revolution in Venezuela will
succeed in overthrowing' Castro, In which

The court lasted four weeks, breaking
all naval records for a court of inquiry.
In adition it was marked by an extraordi
nary event in the fact that on the fif
teenth day of the trial Commander West,
president of the court, was challenged by
Major Lauchheimer and required to with
draw from membership by his colleagues.
The reasons for the challenge sent out
by Major Lauchheimer was that Com
mander West was, by friendship for Colo
nel Meade, unable to act impartially. â¢
Major C. H. Lauchheimer and Colonel
F. L. Denny charged Colonel Robert
Meade with drunkenness on duty while
an inspection was in progress at the
Brooklyn Navy Tard. Colonel Meade re
plied by charging Major Lauchheimer
with making a false report and Colonel
Denny with reporting against him (Meade)
In order to cover up irregularities with
contractors on , Dennv's part.
The court of Inquiry acquitted Major
Lauchheimer and Colonel Denny of Colo
nel Meade's charges. It sustained the
charge against Colonel Meade, and in ad
dition charged him with violation of the
naval regulations in replying with a coun
ter-charge when asked for a report, and
also of false swearing on the witness
stand. The court recommended that the
colonel be tried by court-martial upon
these charges.

..Meanwhile, as The Call has previously

of the bill, and his friends are alleged to
have- been soliciting business from liquor
dealers and assuring their clients that
without victory there would be no costs
for legal advice.
The Supreme Court lays away the argu
ments of the various county attorneys
one after the other with little or no con
sideration and unqualifiedly affirms the
validity of the amendment. Â¦*.
Pflrrmann had paid the regular munici
pal tax to the authorities of the city of
Los Angeles. When the county tax was
also levied he rebelled and was impris
oned.' The Supreme Court released him.

then the Los Angeles District Attorney
and a dozen amici curiae have been delv
ing into musty tomes in a vain endeavor
to prove that the fateful amendment was
unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court yesterday, in the
case of Henry Pfirrmann of Los Angeles,
upheld the validity of the Kelley-Taylor
license amendment, and now the outside
counties must bear the loss of millions of

Director Rush of Suisun said that he
had no personal interest one way or the
other, but Sacramento was the logical
place for the State Fair, and here it
should stay. Thf> racetrack and pavilion
properties were hero along with other
State buildings, and this was the place
for the State Fair. Perhaps the present
Agricultural Park site was too valuable
to be kept much longer and might be sold
profitably and cheaper ground bought
further out. But he was against the sug
gestion that the State Fair leave Sacra
mento. = . \-;">v i\ .
Director A. M. Barrett said that, of
course, if the State Fair were located near
a big center of population it would draw
a larger attendance than if situated
where this large population could not
easily be drawn upon. He would hot ex
press his opinion as to .whether the State
Fair should be removed, and added that
nothing would ever be done during his
term of office, which runs another year
Director. Fred Cox said that it was all
nonsense to talk about removing the State
Fair. It would stay where it Is. The Sac
ramento people were all right, declared
Mr. Cox.
Director Charles Paine said that it was
unfortunate that the State Fair Club had
not been able to do as much as last year
in the way, of furnishing vaudeville at
tractions in connection with the pavilion
display, and there were other things
which combined against the fair. Includ
ing the strike in San Francisco; but nev
ertheless the receipts were all right. He
said the San Jose people could not pay
their own purses. He did not believe the
fair would be removed thither or any
where else. He should say "Jim" Rea
was simply giving circulation to some hot
air.
"Santa Clara County now has the Stan
ford University," said he; "it has the
Odd Fellows' Home, which it secured
from Butte County; it has the Mount
Hamilton Observatory, a. State Normal
School and the Agnews State Hospital. It
has enough public institutions now. There
is nothing wrong with our fair here. The
receipts compare favorably with those of
last year. Our receipts at the pavilion on
Monday night exceeded those of the same
night last year. The Sacramento people
are all right and the fair should stay
where it is."
Director Grove L. Johnson of the State
Agricultural Society said that there was
always talk in some quarter or other
about removing the State Fair from Sac
ramento to this point or that. Last win
ter, he said, Oakland wanted it, but as
chairman of the Judiciary Committee of
the House he used his influence to keep
the fair where it was. San Jose should
be content, with what it had, said Mr.
Johnson.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11.â The proposi
tion suggested by James \V. Rea, the San
Jose politician, that the State Fair be re
moved from Sacramento to San Jose does
not appear to be seriously entertained
here, although the danger of Sacramento
losing the fair at some time or other by
legislative action is admitted. Such of the
directors of the State Board of Agricul
ture as are in town and could be seen
have failed to say anything which would
indicate that they are discussing- the sug
gestion advanced by Rea, while, on the
other hand, Sacramentans generally ridi
cule the suggestion. On the grounds that
Santa Clara County has all the State in
stitutions now that it should have and
that the fact that its district fair is in
debt to Sacramento horsemen for purses
which they won last year show that
the Santa Clara people now have as big a
bite as they can easily chew.
Agricultural Directors Say the Fair
Will Remain There.

The morgue was this morning crowded
by Japanese, one of whom identified the
dead men, but none knew anything con
cerning: the motive of the killing.
Officer McSvvajit is resting comfortably
and iti believed to be practically out of
danger. His hand Is badly shattered, but
the doctors believe he will be able to use
It again, although it will never be as
strong as the other.
A third Japanese has escaped the vigi
lance of the officers. Whether or not he
had anything to do with the shooting is
not known, but he was present when it
took place. He was closely pursued by
Officers Nelson and Ragrsdaie, but eluded
them when their attention was attracted
by the discovery .of the murderer.
Officers Nelson and Ragsdale pursued
the murderer and found him hiding in a
lot in the rear of a house, not far trom.
tne scene of the shooting. When discov
ered he made a dash for liberty, at the
tame time liring at the officers. A few
seconds later he was fatally wounded by
Officer Nelson, the bullet entering the
base of the spine and emerging- from the
left ot the groin. A hack was summoned
and he was removed to jail. He battled
iiercely with his captors, trying to bite
them. Dr. Maupin was summoned, but
in a half hour tfce murderer was dead.
After the altercation had continued five
minutes Kido drew a revolver and shot
Toniguchi twice, one ball "going through
the heart. Toniguchi fell dead. Hearing
the shots. Policeman McSwane ran up to
interfere and Kido shot him, one ball go
ing through the muscles under the left
arm and the other through the palm of
the left hand, shattering the small bones.
Medical aid was summoned and McSwane
was removed to ihe Burnett Sanitarium,
where his wounds were pronounced not
serious. He lost much blood and is very
weak.
FRESNO, Sept- 1Lâ Two Japanese la
borers, named Kido and Toniguchi, were
killed and Policeman McSwane severely
wounded as the result of a drunken
brawl that occurred in the tenderloin dis
trict at 1:30 o'clock this morning.

Senator Oneal wants the fair to come to
San Jose, and while he refuses to say
much it is said that urless the State so
ciety takes the desired action a bill reor
ganizing the board and naming San Jose
as the site, of- the State Fair will be in
troduced by him during the next session
of the Legislature.
The plan to' remove the State Fair to
this city is meeting the approval of the
people. Horsemen have held several in
formal meetings, and James W. Rea has
been directed to promote the idea. State
Senator Oneal, who represents the Thirty
first District, has been consulted, not only
for his legal opinion, but also to obtain
his influence to have the changj made.
Rea is out of town at present, but it is
known that he is doing the hardest kind
of work to bring- the fair to San Jose.
G. Y. Bol linger. Dr. Nash, F. W. Covey
of the Stanford stock farm and others
are enthusiastic over, the project. About
the county are located Rea's Vendome
stables, Donahue's Laurelwood farm.
Boots' Elmwood farm and the Stanford
stock farm, anJ all of these concerns are
said to be a unit in favor of bringing the
fair to this city.
Secretary H. H. Main of the Santa Cla
ra Agricultural Society said to-day:
"Of course, we want the State Fair, and
San Jose ought to get it. This is the
natural place for the State Fair. We have
one of the best parks in the State, and
there Is none that equals it except Los
Angeles. Both the running, and the trot
ting tracks were clayed at an expense of
I S40U0, and they are of the best. Horsemen
from all over the State have praised the
track. "We have seventy-seven acres here
and it is all available for a State Fair.
Besides the equable climate.that is bo de
sirable for the training of horses, we
have the finest system of water works of
any racetrack in the State, and then there
are the beautiful groves of trees for shade
for exercising the stock on hot and sultry
days. There are 350 box-stalls on the
grounds for horses and fifty stalls for cat
tle. There is a fine grand stand for the
racecourse. The big pavilion would be
ample for all the exhibits of Â¦. the State
Fair. Besides these we have a cement bi
cycle track, with grand stand, that cost
more than $8000, and there are good base
ball and football grounds."
Senator Oneal said: "I have been con
sulted by a number of those. interested in
the movement now on foot to move the
State Fair from Sacramento, with a view
of determining whether or not it would be
necessary to obtain the passage of an act
of the Legislature authorizing the change.
After a careful examination of the stat
utes 1 Â¦ find nothing that prohibits the
State Agricultural Board from taking
such action as it may deem advisable. At
most it would require nothing more than
a resolution directing that the next State
Fair meet in San Jose, and that In itself
would be sufficient, in my mind."
SAN JOSE, Sept. 11.â Santa Clara Coun
ty is willing to take the State Fair off
Sacramento's hands, and the movement
to this end Is assuming some proportions.
San Jose is the main factor In the fight,
and it is proposed to locate the annual
State exhibit in this city. San Jose claims
to have the best racetrack in the State
for a meeting such as is held in connec
tion with the State Fair.

Mrs. Webber was granted ten days to
file her answer. She will deny the charge
of intemperance and file a cross-complaint
asking for a divorce from Webber on the
ground of desertion.
Attorney Costello. representing Mrs.
Webber, brought the matter to the atten
tion cf Judge Sloss yesterday and secured
an order setting aside the decree of di
vorce, thus reopening the case.
Webber went quietly to the City Hall
afterward and secured a decree of divorce
by default.
Charles Webber, who began an action
for divorce from his wife several months
ago upon the grounds of Intemperance
and desertion, will not be rid of her as
easily as he expected. Webber played a
shrewd trick after having the pa

behaved so well that he prevailed upon
her to destroy the papers she had been
served with as a party to the suit.

warrant the taking of the pilot-boat from
Oakland to Sausalito, where everything
could move along under the personal su
pervision of Captain "Alec" Swanson. .
It was here that the launch : Augusta
was pressed Into service. Captain Swan
son wanted the Lady Mine at anchor in
Richardson Bay before dark, and the
wind was light, so a tow was in order.
The Augusta made fast to the pilot-boat
and made good progress until Alcatraz
was abeam. Then the towing line parted
and the Lady Mine started up the Sacra
mento on the flood tide. The Augusta
caught her off Angel Island and an at
tempt was made to get through Raccoon
Straus. When off the quarantine station
the launch broke down and both vessels
were rapidly drifting ashore, when the
Lady Mine's anchor was let go and held.
The pilot-boat could have made sail and
reached Sausalito, but she could not tow
the launch and the latter had no anchor.
After working an hour over his engines
Harry Johnson finally got ready for an
other start, but the anchor of. the . pilot
boat was not more than out of water
when the launch broke down again. This
time the Lady Mine's anchor did not
hold, and both schooner and launch had
a narrow escape. Finally everything was
straightened out and the Augusta and
her tow reached Sausalito. Harry John
son offered Captain bwansona trip back
to San Franciuco, but the offer was de
clined with thanks, and the gallant pilot
slept on the so ft side of an eight-foot plank
in the Lady Mine's dismantled cabin. It
was lucky he did so, as the Augusta
broke down again and nearly drifted to
sea. It was early in the morning when
Captain Johnson finally got her back to
Folsom street, where she was laid up for
repairs.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution transferring the bal
ance of the school tund for the flo
ral year 1899-1900, amounting to 522,966 OS,
10 the credit of the surplus fund
cf 1900-1901 to cover the payments to
fchool teachers on salaries of previous
years. This action was taken notwith
standing the fact that the charter con
tains a specific provision that the residue
of the school fund shall not so to the
surplus fund, but shall be carried over
Into the next fiscal year to be used for
discharging obligations incurred during
that period.
Auditor Wells holds that the resolution
is illegal and says that some other means
must be found to liquidate the indebted
ness to teachers.
Ordinances were finally passed denning
the districts for the maintenance of car
pet beating works, tanneries or shoddy
mills; regulating the speed of automobiles
and providing- for the storage of gasoline
or petroleum for the machines; providing
for the full acceptance of Washington
street between Franklin and Gbugh;
North Point street between Van Ne?s
avenue and L.arkin. and Dolores street
between Twentv-third ind Twentv- i
fourth.
The ordinance providing for the punish
ment of persons found guilty of defraud
ing livery stable keepers and imposing a
license of $4 per quarter on keepers of sta
bles who rent horses or vehicles was
passed to print.
The Tax Collector was authorized to ap
point forty extra clerks for a temporary
period.
A permit was granted to the Harbor
Commissioners to extend a series of nine
tracks of the belt railroad from Sea Wall
lot 14 over and across Broadway, between

opinion whether the Board of Supervisors
may legally deduct trenching inspection

buked again when the payment of de
mands amounting- to ?436S for telephone

be deferred until such time as the com
pany meets its obligations in the payment

PILOT-BOAT LADY MINE AND LAUNCH
AUGUSTA NARROWLY ESCAPE DISASTER
THE pilot-boat Lady Mine and the
gasoline launch 'Augusta had a
stormy time of it on the . bay
Tuesday night. One was helping
the other from Oakland Creek to
Sausalito. Once they parted company and
twice they nearly went ashore on Alca
traz and Angel Island. After about six
hours of hard work the pilot-boat was
finally landed at an anchorage off the San
Francisco Yacht Club boathouse, while
the launch started for San Francisco. On
the way the latter nearly went to sear,
and it was only after four hours of labor
that the captain got her back to the Fol
som-street float. All of yesterday the
Augusta was under repairs.
The Lady Mine is laid up for her year
ly overhauling. A new water tank was
put in at Boole's yard. The accommoda
tions for the pilots were' torn out and new
bunks and living-rooms will be put in.
The work had progressed far enough to
5
twenty-live minutes later than at Fort Point;
the height of tide is the same at both places.

DANDEUFF WON'T WASH OXTT.
The Germ That Causes It Has to Be
Destroyed to Cure Dandruff.
Many a woman spends an hour twice a
week scouring her scalp, thinking scrub-
bing off the scurf will cure the dandruff.
Two hours a week, at the age of 40 years,
she has spent 260 days of twelve hours
each, cr two-thirds of a year of her life.
in that vain hope â vain, because you can't
cure dandruff v, ithout killing the dandruff
perm, and the only hair preparation on
{â¢arth that will do so Is Newbro's "Herpl-
K.cide"â also a delig-htful hairdressingr, and
a thorough antiseptic against all conta-
gion from use of others' hairbrushes. It
is also a delightful hairdressing.

IN REPLY TO THREATS OF ATTACK BY THE YELLOW
PRESS UPON THE CHARACTERS OF MEN IN OPPOSITION
EDITOR OF THE CALL: The Examiner is certainly the
worst enemy of the State of California and especially
of San Francisco. This discarded mistress of the rail
road for years has sought to avenge itself on all our
interests, including alike capital and workmen. It pub
"lished a mass of lies about the bubonic plague to deter money,
skill and muscle from enlarging our population and developing
our resources. It is now engaged in the congenial effort to
libel our merchants and to precipitate riots. It required little
intelligence to discern, and it has since been proved, that its
j pretended report of remarks to police officers by the Chief of
Police. was a naked distortion and fabrication.
In' 1856 the San Francisco Herald was reduced-to less than a
third of its original 'size in one day for an attack upon busi
ness men, merchants and laborers who comprised the Vigilance
Committee %i that year. I am not considering the right or the

wrong of the proceeding, but recall the fact. ,In 1S63 the Ex
aminer, itself, then under the name of the Democratic Press,
was temporarily destroyed by a mob, and afterward, for thÂ«
violent and illegal acts of the rioters, recovered from the
municipality 510,000 in damages. As its existing proprietor
charged to the brim with malignity because he has been lone
since ostracized socially, and by his anarchistic appeals has
alienated our largest and soundest interestsâ has some rich
mines behind him, it is not probable that the lesson of 1856 will
be successfully repeated, but it has frequently happened that
the originator of a tumult has been "hoist with hts own
So Mr. Quincy is to lead a forlorn hope this year",
with the promise of something better next, year, and
with a chance of making a reputation that will give
him prestige at the national Democratic convention
in 1904. Under the circumstances it will be seen that
the politics of the year being dull in other quarters
the Massachusetts campaign will be Worth watching
bythose who are interested in the drifting of Democ
racy.
Upto this time we have heard nothingVpf the plat
form. on which if is" proposed to- nominate -Mr.
Quincy, but that is a matter of: no importance.

Such "is the promise' from Bottom The scheme is
to be carried out by the nomination of Josiah Quincy
for Governor. He has announced a willingness to
make the race, and all. of his competitors save one,
the Hon. Gamaliel Bradford,, have retired in his
favor. Those who know Mr. Quincy well assert that
his consent to run means that everything: has been
fixed not only for this year but for the future. Thus
the- Boston Transcript says: ""It would be but an
empty honor were- Mr. Quincy to be put forward for
this year only. It is not to be supposed that he or
any of the leaders in his party have" the slightest idea
that Governor. Crane can! be defeated by Mr. Quincy
or by anybody else, and Mr. Quincy is not the kind
of man who acts without' a motive. ' It is evident
enough, therefore, that this year's campaign is simply
scoringfor the race in which there may, be a chance
to win in 1902."
MASSACHUSETTS promises to furnish a
State campaign that will be interesting to
the country at large. Her Democracy is to
set aside George Fred Williams and his following of
Bryanites and nominate a ticket that will reunite the
party, bring back the gold men and set an example
for other States to follow. It is not expected the
ticket will be elected. Indeed, it is to be made up
for. export rather than for home consumption. Prob
ably-we're there any prospect of its election the Bry
anites of the party would bolt it, but as there is none
they are expected to vote for it solidly, so that Mas
sachusetts Democracy can say to the Democracy of
other States: "See what I have | done â follow my
example and we will sweep the country in 1904."
WORST ENEMY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
AND ESPECIALLY OF THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
A MASSACHUSETTS CANDIDATE
As a patient, the victim of a crime and the object
of an ordeal on the operating table,, the President
has rendered to humanity a Â¦ service no less distin
guished than many in his official career. Fromthe
first, he has" said, yi. will get well." . When his hand
was withdrawn from his-clothing red with blood from
the breast wound there was no " relaxation of cour
age, no moment of fear or weakness. Optimism,
hope and the determination to live are great elements
in the cure of thestricken. They are all there js.of
suggestive* therapeutics, and he has inspired them *in
many a weak and suffering brother man.; *. '
Â¦ Now surgeons keep their work clear of the germs
which cause inflammation and blood-poisoning, and
the area of capital operations is wonderfully . ex
tended. The President's case is remarkable. Within
thirty minutes after the shooting he was on : the
operating table in ''a hospital. The highest surgical
skill was present. The abdomen was opened. -It
was found that the bullet had pierced the stomach.
The point of entry -was .in the anterior and of exit in
the posterior wall of the stomach. That -organ;, had
to'be lifted from its position and turned over to close
the exit. All this was done before the first newspaper
extra announcing. the crime had left the ,press. - It
is a triumph of American surgery of which the .pro
fession may be* proud. Not. a single unfavorable
symptom has followed the operation, and surgery
stands vindicated as a benign art j" T
It is not a figment of the imagination that hun
dreds of sufferers may in the future be relieved ; and
hundreds of lives may. be saved by this great revela
tion of what the surgeon can do. "
THE President's case calls general attention to
the practice of advanced surgery. "Out of the
evil comes good, for a vast number of people
die by' accidents whose lives could be saved' by anti
septic surgery,; while others .suffer abridgment of life
by disorders which such surgery could cure. These
will learn from the President's case the possibilities
of their own. Because/prior to the knowledge of
bacteriology, certain surgical operations were im
possible, and in certain other capital operations, es
pecially upon the abdomen, the percentage of re
coveries was small, it has come down as a popular
tradition that surgery is limited in its scope. The
fact kas long been that knowledge of anatomy and
knowing where to place the knife were not lacking.
The trouble followecT\the operation. Inflammation,
blood-poisoning and death followed many a success
fully executed operation.
ADVANCED SURGERY.
Hardly any imagination could conceive a more
striking illustration of misery in the midst of joy and
starvation in sight of a feast than this story of real
life told by the Porto Rico Herald: "Yesterday while
a part of the town was celebrating the anniversary of
the American occupation of the island a man was
dying of starvation in the public plaza, lying amid the
flowers. This, notwithstanding the fact that as if to
prevent, such spectacles the committee of celebra
tion distributed on the morning of that same day a
thousand rations of meat."
Roosevelt says that since January 1 he has received
fully 2000 invitations to deliver addresses. When-
Bryan hears of that it will give him pain to think
how much he has ; missed. , I ':Â¦. ~
The fact Is that we find among the names of officers and
masters of ships belonging to this port, as well as to others on
this coast, a great many of our Scandinavian sailors who have
toiled honorably on merchant ships as well as in the Govern
ment service. They . have gained confidence and ability and
have sought higher knowledge through navigation schools.
They have won the confidence of ship owners and to-day pos
sess honorable places in the latter's service. Many have settled
sailors, the majority of whom are, ,as is . well known.
Scandinavians, are indifferent to the prosperity of the port of
San Francisco. 'Such an. opinion may have naturally followed
the reading of the utterances which the editorial contained, but
the facts are .not so. As a citizen of San Francisco . for fifteen
years I have learned to know our people here and their pur
suits in life. By fair inquiry among the sailors we will find
that very few will take ships for Europe, but would rather stay
on the coast, where, consequently, their earnings in most cases
will be distributed, especially during winter, in payment for
lodgings, clothes, etcJ^which is for the good of our coast cities.
EDITOR OF THE CALL: I read with indignation the
statement made in the editorial columns of the San
Francisco Call of to-day, under the heading, "A Wrong

Then let me. in, behalf of our Scandinavian nallora
and whips' officers on this coast, correct the Impres
sion that the reading: of the artlele 'mentioned mar
have given yonr readers. It wonld not be honest
and fair to pnt discredit upon these hard-trurktns
sailors, as might be done by those unacquainted
with the facts npon reading: the editorial mentioned.
And may we not Judge too severely those who walked
out nt the order of their leaders t Â¦
down here, have their own homes and contribute to the welfare
of our well-HRed city of San Francisco. Only last year the re
port of one of our navigation schools in San Francisco showed
that about 75 per cent of those officers who passed the school
with honorable examinations were Scandinavians, who will fill
the vacant places on ships here when the time comes. Every
one who knows about the shipping of this port knWs this to
be the fact.
If we are going to enter upon the task of suppress
ing anarchy we must deal with the powerful as well
as with the weak votaries of the creed. One thing is
certain: Society cannot tolerate among the directors
of its institutions men who promote anarchy either
by precept or practice. If Mr. Cummings is to re
main a trustee 6f the Mechanics' Institute Library
he should at once sever his connection with anarch
ists; or if he choose to remain with the brotherhood
he should retire from the~institutc.
Among the letters of Emma Goldman found by the
police is one in which she complains that Prince
Krapotkin received $750 for a series of lectures in
New York while she has to lecture on the streets
and content herself with such petty contributions as
the crowds give her. Her complaint is not without
justification. Why should society applaud in a
Prince that which it condemns in a poverty-stricken
woman? Why should the law tolerate Krapotkin
any more than Goldman?
Mr. Cummings is too widely and too well known
in this city for any one to suspect him of conspiring
to assassinate any one. He could not have attained
a trusteeship in the Mechanics' Library unless he had
won the esteem of a considerable number at least of
the best people in the city. The very readiness, how
ever, with which those who know him will acquit
him of any suspicion of criminal impulse - renders it
all the more strange that he should have 'any sym
pathy or association with the miserable outcasts of
the earth who look upon assassins as heroes, and
who are restrained from murder only by the coward
ice of their, natures,?
It will not do to exhaust ourselves in denouncing
the anarchists of the slums and leave the. anarchists
of social position uncondemned. As a trustee of one
of the most important institutions of the city Mr.
Cummings is something more than a private indi
vidual. He is charged with a public duty, and has a
voice in the control of a semi-public institution.
The public has therefore a right to expect him to.be
an upholder of law, of religion and of the: whole so
cial organism. What, then, shall be said of him now,
that at the very time when the whole nation is out
raged by the anarchist attempt to murder the Presi
dent he. shows himself at an anarchist meeting .as a
believer m the creed and a supporter of its propa
ganda? Â»
We have had in our own city an evidence of the ex
tent to which that kind of support has been given to
anarchists by men from whom society has a right to
expect better things. At the meeting of the v self
styled "Independent Debating Club" on the Sunday
following the attempted murder of the President
there was amid the crowd of obscure fools or worse
who applauded the sentiments of the orators in at
tacking Christianity and vilifying the President at
least one man whose presence there is not to be
passed over unnoted. That man is Mr. George Cum
.mings, a trustee of the Mechanics' Institute Library.
WHILE we are denouncing the wretched fol
lowers of the leaders of anarchy and calling
for the arrest and punishment of every one
who was in any way associated with Czolgosz in His
attempt to assassinate the President, let us not fort
get that the miserable and obscure anarchists who
lurk in the slums of our cities are not the only un
holders and supporters of the creed. There are
learned men like Krapotkin of Russia and Reclus of
France, calling themselves ''philosophical anarch
ists," whose influence is more potent and perhaps
more pernicious than that of the slum leaders.
There are also, persons known as respectable citizens
who by reason of some vagary of mind or heart asso
ciate themselves with anarchists and to some extent
abet them in their crimes even while ostensibly de
ploring the commission of assassination as a "folly."

PLEADS IN BEHALF OF THOSE SCANDINAVIANS
WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE SEAFARING LIFE
-With that sentiment The Call cordially agrees. In
fact, The Call has many times reminded the public
that many of the strikers entered upon it unwillingly
and would gladly return to their work. It is an un
fortunate fact that men with families to support have
been forced out of employment by the. dictation of
persons who have no , responsibility resting upon
them. That many members of the Sailors'- Union are
included in the number 'of the' unwilling .we do not
doubt. That- facfc- only- emphasizes the 'statement
made in The Call' editorial that -'American homes are
being injured by the action of irresponsible parties
who have no interest in them.
There is one point in our correspondent's letter, to
which especial, attention should be paid!' He says:
"Let me, on behalf of our Scandinavian sailors and
officers on this coast, change the impression the read
ing of the article mentioned may have given the read
ers. It would not be; honest and fair to give these
hardworking sailors the miscredit which to the^, un
acquainted with- the facts the statement has, naturally
given; * and may we riot judge too severely those
who walked' out at the order of their leaders? Who
knows howmany among them this day would gladly
rectify the wrong which has been done if it lay in
their power?"'
The Call has no attack to make upon Scandinavian
sailors- nor upon any other sailors. The statements
of fact contained in the editorial were made by Furu
seth, and The Call did no more than direct attention
to them and point out; their significance. It neither
affirmed nor denied the accuracy of the estimates as
to the number of foreigners and of unmarried
men in the Sailors' Union, but said:' "Accepting^
Furuseth's statement as true, it will be seen that a
union composed; mainly of foreigners and almost
wholly , of , unmarried men is now endeavoring
to tie up the trade of the port, prevent, the shipment
of the products of our farms and enforce idleness and
the danger of destitution upon, the homes of. Ameri
cans;, and, moreover, are doing it with a feeling of
impunity, for, as^ Furuseth says, they can profit by
the stagnation of business here to make a trip to
Europe, visit their friends and have a good time
while, American homes, are bearing the affliction of
the strike." : .
SPACE in another column is given this morning
to a communication from G. F. Wikstrom in
relation, to an editorial in The' Call of Wednes
day under; the title, "A' Wrong to Americans." The
editorial is based upon a statement of Andrew
Furuseth that the Sailors' Union is not, worrying
about the strike because most of its members are not
citizens of the United States and would not object
to a trip to Europe while the strike is/goin'g on, and,
moreover, that only about 5 per cent of them are
married men. Mr. Wikstrom writes to correct what
he regards an injustice "done to the Scandinavian
sailors, and we~ gladly give his letter publication. . .
THE STRIKING SAILORS.
In reading the reports that come from New York
about what a wonderful boat is' Shamrock II it will
be well to remember that we heard the same kind of
reports about every challenger that ever came for the

boats. ,
: ?.The tone> of the publication is intensely pessimis
tic. It attacks, berates and belittles the qualities of
generosity, humanity and kindness and is Ravage in
expression against all existing institutions. Wher
ever there is disorder and lawlessness it sides with
those who cause it. It excuses and extenuates all
kinds of crime, evidently regarding the criminal in
stinct, as merely a proper protest against existing
conditions. Much of its matter would be perfectly
at home in the Examiner. ;

On the editorial page the Chicago Anarchist Club
announces that "the Chicago comrades are preparing
for the fall and winter campaign of education.
Meetings will be held to which comrades are invited
that they may learn how to make bombs and witness
the process of selecting the removers of obnoxious
lulers." On the same page the police are denounced
in almost exactly the terms employed in the same
business by the Examiner. Among the editorial mat
ter appears this statement: "The efficacy of punish
ment is disputed in modern sociology, but an occa
sional execution committed on tyrants seems to have
a healthful effect on these monsters in human form.
Since the execution of King Humbert the Italian
anarchist weekly, L'Agitazione, has not been mo
lested, while before it was constantly persecuted,
both by the censor and the police."
Then a Mr. Blum makes himself interesting;. on the
subject of "Voting Cattle," and is followed by Mr.
Kinghom-Jones of 36\Geary. street, San Francisco,
who desires that the Government issue fifty billions
of greenbacks and pay labor ten dollars a day, and in
sists that "Government damns itself" by not doing
this at once.
Con Lynch of Los Angeles, Cal., contributes an
appeal to workingmen to join the anarchists, remark
ing that the interests of labor require "that every tie
that at present holds human society together be
broken."
The first article is entitled "The Monster Slayer,"
which gives the story of Hercules and the Dragon,
Theseus,- Jason, extracts from the Arabian Nights,
and concludes: "Oh, Gradgrind, wilt thou call it
unreality and fiction, that which has fed the souls
of so many generations/ who could not be persuaded
that they had none; when in this very millennial age
of pig-philosophy a Bresci, Luccheni and Angiolillo
appear like the Arabian Princess, each ready to burn
up some Devil's grandson of a genie, at cost of being
burnt with him?"
BESIDES its literature in -the Hearst papers
anarchy supports an expression of its creed
in a special journal, which has hard work to
hold its own as an exponent of murder and disorder
against the competition of the American, Journal and
Examiner. This organ is called "Free Society: For
merly The Firebrand; Exponent of Anarchist-
Communism." , The issue of Sunday, September i,
is No. 31 of Volume VII. The paper and typography
are excellent.. It contains no advertisements except
of the books of Krapotkin, Lissagaray; "the famous
speeches of the v eight anarchists in court, and Alt
geld* s reasons - for pardoning Fielden, Neebe and
Schwab"; the works of Jean Grave; "God and the
State," by Nikolas Bakunin; "The Economics of
Anarchy,'' by Lum, and various writings by Mala

which are these lines:

Michael Casey, business agent of the
Teamsters' Union, has sent a communica

the Merchants* Association Tuesday, that
he (Casey) had called upon Dohrmann to

The ship A. G. Ropes arrived in port a
few days ago in ballast from Yokohama.
The boat has been chartered to transport
a cargo of wheat to Europe. When the
A. G. Ropes reached this harbor her crew,
consisting entirely of union men. were re
quested to join the ranks of the strikers.
The request, however, was denied. The
men expressed themselves as being
As far as the tie-up in the water front
district was concerned the chief event of
importance yesterday was the departure
of the ship Santa Clara of the cannery
fleet with a full non-union crew. The
boat's destination is I the canneries in
Alaska. The Santa Clara was one of the
first of the cannery fleet to arrive in port
and on her arrival she was Immediately
deserted by all her crew. They were called
out on strike by the City Front Federa
tion. According to the statement which
was issued by Andrew Furuseth a few
days ago it is such boats as the Santa
Clara that the strikers are chiefly inter
ested In tying up and for this reason the
clearing of the Santa Clara yesterday
caused great rejoicing among the ship
owners.

strike for the next five weeks.
Prepare to Continue Fight.
The Brotherhood of Teamsters issued a
permit yesterday allowing a striking
teamster to temporarily drive a truck for
Jacob Silversteln, a member of the Dray
men's Association. The permission was
granted solely out of consideration for
Silverstein. by whose truck a lad was ac
cidentally run over and killed Tuesday
afternoon on Brannan street. The acci
dent necessitated Silverstein's appearance
in court, and in order that his business
might not suffer during his absence the
striker was permitted to take his place
on the truck. The brotherhood claims
still to have control over the man, and
should they feel at any time that their
cause is being injured by his driving the
truck the permit will be revoked.

Since the strike of the unions affiliated
with the City Front Federation was com
menced-hundreds of thousands of feet of
lumber have accumulated on the wharves.
In fact to such an extent has the lumber
been piled up that the Harbor Commis
sioners at their meeting yesterday after
noon instructed the Chief Wharfinger to
request the lumber dealers to have their
property removed from the wharves. The
commissioners in issuing the instructions
stated that they thought there was suffi
cient available labor for the removal of
the-lumber without inconvenience.

and yesterday after they had been paid
off by the United States Shipping Com
missioner they re-enlisted without an ex
ception.
The schooner Web foot arrived in port

Ing her entire crew was called out on
strike. -
Casey declares that Dohrmajin made the
overtures in that direction and not him
self.
Speeches were delivered- by Tobin. Wil
son and Reed, and when the roll " was
called the resolutions were indefinitely
postponed by a vote of 10 to 6.
Supervisor Curtis said he had always
aided the cause of labor by his vote In
the board, but he was in favor of the
postponement of the resolutions. Super
visor Brandensteln also opposed their
passage. He said they did not serve any
end and did. nothing to end the strike. He
suggested that the board confine itself to
legislation and keep its hands off things
that did not concern .it. Â¦ .
I am not a candidate for any office, so I can
be candid. There is an implication, in thn
resolution that peace reigns in this city and
we are amply protected by police. We do see
every day in the papers accounts of trouble.
W& daily learn of one man beating: an
other and the ag-gressor is allowed to depart
without being arrested. I do not want my vote

think we have policemen enough and I believe
the force shouM be Increased so a man can at
tend to his business without being in danger
of being molested. This Is the opinion of
every peaceful and law-abiding- citizen in this

and' am in favor of their indefinite postpone
ment.
by his strong speech against their pass
age. In part he said:
Many similar instances of destitution
relieved by the former employer of strik
ers might be recorded. One. prominent
merchant whose porters walked out near
ly two months ago has been supplying the
families of a half-dozen of his ex-em
ployes with the necessities of life for
weeks past. In all of. these cases the
fathers have b^en more than willing to
return to work, but they fear to do so
lest they be beaten to death. Numerous
instances have developed of strikers de
serting their families entirely, the result
being that their support temporarily has
devolved upon the former employers of
their husbands and fathers. In this re
spect the employers have shown a spirit
of benevolence which only the mothers of
suffering children will appreciate at its
full value. Meanwhile the destitution fol
lowing in the wake of the strike Js be-
The protestations of sincerity and con
stancy so often heard at the commence
ment of the strike have given way to
expressions of discontent. The first cir
cumstance to awaken dissension in the
ranks was the failure of the unions to
pay the strike benefits according- to the
by-laws of the organizations, supplement
ed by the promises of the leaders. Where
these Jaws called for the payment of $5
a week to each - striker only $3, and in ;
numerous instances only $1 was actually,
paid. With the possible exception of the
Sailors' Union none of the labor organi
zations have oaid the strikers what was
their ;'due and which they had the.. right
to demand. When the failure of the
unions to pay strike benefits was com
mented upon the officers of the unions
proudly asserted that the members did
not want the money guaranteed them and
that their enthusiasm for the cause
prompted them to fight for a great prin
ciple even though they starved. Mean
while the lot of the strikers grew worse
daily. â¢
The inevitable result of this deprivation
of their weekly wage was bitter destitu
tion in the households of thousands of the
strikers. Dozens of teamsters with suf
fering wives and children, fearing to re
turn to their former places because of the
danger from violence at the hands of ruf
fians, accepted places as iongshoremen at
the wharves and in the railroad sheds.
Longshoremen began to drive teams un
der police protection or left for Interior
towns, where they accepted work at any
price, thereby depriving others of posi
tions which they filled season after sea
son. While their places were taken by
men from the country at increased wages
the strikers were working at~ anything
they could find to do in order to secure
the means for supplying their necessities.
It was a trade of positions, by which the
striker suffered not only the permanent
loss of his place, but his residence as
well. . .
Enthusiasm_for the cause of labor will
not prevent Hanger from gnawing or des
titution from asserting its chill presence
when the sole weapon of defense against
the foe has been lost. Many of the fami
lies of strikers are now being supported
by the employers, and the stories told of
their pitifui sufferings would appal the
stoutest heart. Yesterday a teamster ap
plied to his former employer for aid. The
man wÂ«pt bitterly as he told of a daugh
ter dying from consumption, while he, the
father, was unable to provide her with the
delicacies for which those near to death
and struggling despairingly against the
encroachments of a fatal disease so often
yearn. The employer hastened to-the re
lief of the dyir.e girl, and It is needless
to-Eay that her last hours will be free
from the gaunt shadow of want which at
tended her illness ever 3ince the strike be
gan. .
Results of the Strike.
From time to time reports of disaffec
tion in the ranks of the strikers have been
circulated and as persistently denied. Not
withstanding the vehement denials of
these rumors by the leaders of the strik
ers facts develop from day to day which
prove beyond question that the strikers
are assuming an attitude which is caus
ing the leaders annoyance and anxiety.
The men are restless, many of them are
suffering actual want, while their leaders
are banqueting each other at leading ho
tels; hundreds of strikers are "scabbing"
in secret in order that their families shail
not suffer. Every promise made to the
strikers by their unions was violated and
the strike benefits which were relied upon
by the men for their maintenance during
the pendency of the struggle were exceed
ingly intermittent and unsatisfactory. The
result has been the creation of a spirit
of hostility in the minds of the better
element of the strikers against a principle
which entails upon them only trouble and
privations, loss of positions and the week
ly wage without which their families must
become objects of charity or starve.
That there is abundant reason for be
lieving this view of the < situation will
eventually be realized is; apparent to
many. It has been demonstrated beyond
question that a large percentage of the
strikers are dissatisfied and that many
who went out seven weeks ago have of
necessity been compelled to seek employ
ment elsewhere. Numerous men would re
turn to their work to-morrow were it not
because of their fear of personal violence.
The management of the Draymen's Asso
ciation state positively that the strike
would be ended within twenty-four hours
were it possible to secure police protection
for the army of men who are more than
anxious to return to the avenues of labor
which they deserted weeks ago in sup
port of the principle of unionism.
TO those who have kept in touch
with the events of the strike the
situation to-day offers better
prospects for a settlement than at
any time since x the inauguration
of the struggle between the contending
factions. The impression prevails in busi
ness circles that the strike is failing more
and more as the days pass and that the
end will come ultimately without any
recognized agreement between the con
testants as to the settlement of issues at
stake. . . . â¢
A prominent merchant said yesterday
that he looked for a stampede among tho
strikers very shortly. He stated that the
attitude of the Employers' Association, to
gether with the indorsement of the course
of that body by the Merchants' Associa
tion, has filled the strikers with despair:
The prospects of winning the struggle
now appear 1 very dim to the more Intelli
gent of the strikers, and notwithstanding
the assurances of their leaders that the
employers are playing a big game of
bluff, the strikers are realizing that their
cause ia virtually lost. 'â¢ For" the reasons
given herein there are many business men
who believe that the end must come
shortly, and that when It does it will come
with a rush.
A few days ago a man was working at
the Broadway dock. He was engaged In
placing sacks of grain into a truck. Sud
denly a voice cried out: "D you, take
that!" Before the worker could turn he
was struck on the arm with a club, which
snapped the bone as If it it had been a
reed. The man's cries attracted an offi
cer to the scene, btit the assailant had
disappeared as if the earth had swallowed
him up. The unfortunate victim of the
cowardly assault now carries his arm in
a sling, but, fortunately, friends will see
that his family does not suffer while he
Is incapacitated from working. Many
similar instances of brutality might be
mentioned. Dozens of men have suffered
the maiming of their members by human
brutes, and it is because of the fear of
incurring like treatment that the better
element of th*Â» strikers do not desert
their cause and return to their long-ne
glected employment.
Another reason for the dissatisfaction
expressed by many strikers is the abom
inable atrocities of which many strikers
or their sympathizers have been guilty
during the past few weeks. It would be
impossible to even estimate the number
of assaults committed upon worthy work
ingmen who were maimed and beaten for
exercising their constitutional privilege of
laboring at anything that suited their
convenience. Honest men with families
to support have been tracked to and from
their work by gangs of ruffians, and when
the opportunity presented itself they were
overpowered and well nigh j clubbed or
kicked to death. Since the inauguration
of the strike, according to the estimate
of the police, no less than 2000 assaults
have been committed upon non-union
men. Hundreds â¢ of assaults Â¦ committed
under cover of darkness were never re
ported to the police. Every- hospital has
narbored from one to fifty victims of the
strikers, and at the Harbor Hospital it
frequently happened that maimed men
were compelled to stand in line and await
their turn to be treated for their wounds.
In every gang of non-union workers men
are to be seen with their heads tied. up,
their eyes blackened, their faces covered
with scars. In dozens of homes non
union men are lying in their beds suffer
ing from wounds about the head and face
and from broken arms and legs. And yet
it has been officially asserted that the
city is peaceful and that no proclamation
commanding the restoration of peace is
necessary!. ,
Brutalities of Strikers.
coming more and more appalling, and if
the end does not come soon- there is no
telling to what depths of misery and suf
fering the' unhappy victimsâ the wives,
mothers and children of the strikersâ may
not descend. - Â¦ .
Extreme Suffering Among Families of the Strikers
and Brutality of Assaults Upon Non-Union Men
Are Believed to Herald Speedy End of Strike
So it seems as if the Board of Harbor
Commissioners, an organization under the
State law, has the primal right to Inter
fere when water front property is in dan
ger of destruction. According to the
opinion of attorneys, after that' body has
been appealed to the State military au
thority is next on the list.
He must require the docks, slips, â¢wharves,
piers and other premises under the jurisdiction
of the board to be kept free from all obstruc
tion-3, and when parties fall to obey his order
to remove the same he must forthwith report
the fact to the board and execute their order
in relation thereto. * ...
In the recital of the duties of the chief
engineer of the board the following is
found in section 2522 of the Political Code:
It is hereby made the duty of the Board of
Police Commissioners of the City and County
of Ean Francisco to appoint such numbers of
Wharfingers and Toll Collectors special police
men as such commissioners shall request, ii.
writing, such Police Commissioners to appoint
* * *. The jurisdiction of ' such policemen
shall be coextensive with the premises de
scribed in this article and their terms of office
as such Wharfingers and Toll Collectors.
The conflict of authority that may arise
depends upon the clash of municipal po
lice power, the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners and the rights invested in the
State in its own special police attributes.
The Political Code contains two sections
directly in point. The first is 2550 and
reads as follows:
Attorney General Ford was interviewed
yesterday on this subject, but had little
to say, he preferring to' reserve his opin
ion until called upon by executive author
ity. Mr. Ford anticipates a call for ad
vice on the part of the Governor and the
Harbor Commissioners and does. not care
to go on record before that event occurs.
He admits that he has examined the law
bearing upon the subject and has found
some points applicable to the question,
but Wtten it comes to a declaration he
seals his knowledge with hermetically
tightened lips, and says he will speaK
wnen the time arrives.
THE memorial of the State Board
of Trade, presenting the condi
tions on the water front. and re
questing the Governor to take
means to prevent the destruction
of property in that district, has excited
a discussion on the legal ability and dis
ability of the several branches of mu
nicipal and State authorities to act in the
premises.
Supervisor Fontana moved that both
resolutions be indefinitely postponed. . He
said he considered both resolutions wern
introduced for the purpose of catching
votes, and further that no member of the
Crtmber of Commerce deserved an af
front of that kind. Reed tried to be face
tious at Mr. Fon tana's expense but failed!
He argued that the strikers were doing
their utmost to preserve the peace., and
therefore asked that the resolutions be
adopted. \
Supervisor Comte surprised. the board
The most exciting discussion of the af
ternoon was over the resolutions intro
duced.by Reed censuring the Chamber of
Con.merce and Police Commissioner New
hal'. for their stand in the present labor
troubles.
Reed's Resolutions Debated.
This ordinance shall take effect immediately. 1
Mr. Fontana asked that both ordinances
be referred to ffie Police Committee for
its approval. Reed objected to this on
the ground that the committee had al
ready reported on his ordinance. Super
visor Braunhart then delivered a stirring
talk in favor of his ordinance. There was
a heated discussion over the matter, and
Supervisor Comte brought the debate to
a close by moving that both ordinances
be referred to the City and County At
torney for his opinion as to whether the
beard 'has jurisdiction in the premises.
The motion was carried by a vote of 10
to 5. ...
Sec. 5. The Board of Police Commissioners Is
hereby empowered to make such additional
rules and regulations respecting the govern
ment, discipline, equipment and uniform of
such special police officers, not inconsistent
v.-lth the provisions of this ordinance.
Sec. 4. Every special police officer so ap
pointed, before entering upon the discharge of
his duties, shall execute a bond, with two or

When the ordinance introduced by Su
pervisor Reed at a previous meeting to
compel special police officers to wear a
distinctive uniform was read by the clerk,
Supervisor Braunhart offered the follow
ing as a substitute:
Braunhart's Substitute Order.
Mr. Fontana asserted that he, did not
object to the report, but did object to the
criticism made by the committee. He
said the board was a -legislative body,
and therefore had no right to criticise two
organizations outside of its province. He
charged that the committee had seen fit
to criticise the Employers' Association,
and he thought it was not a proper thing
for them to do. Supervisor Bran
deiistein claimed that there was
no intention to criticise the as
sociation, and asked for the adop
tion of the report. Arguments were made
by Supervisors Tobln, Reed and Dwyer in
favor of the motion, and short speeches
were made by Hotaling and Wilson
against it. A vote was taken and the
motion prevailed by a vote of 12 to 4.
The committee appointed by this board was
charged with the speclnc duty of endeavoring
to bring about a conference between the Em
ployers' Association and their employes and to
take any other means necessary to terminate
the strike. We bent our energies and gave our
time in an "effort to secure such a conference,
but failed. -The committee met the labor unions
and they consented to a conference. On the
"other hand the Employers' Association would
not consent to a conference. We think, with
out poins into the merit of the controversy or
questions Involved, that they are. unwise, that
their procedure is unwarranted and we beliew
that if they had agreed to. a conference, the
entering wedge would have been made whereby
this strike would have been settled. They
would not agree to it. They say they will not
deal with unions, but will only deal as lndl
vi'Jjial employers with individual employes. W>
dorrt believe as a committee that their stand
Is a proper one. We can't imagine how a con
ference could do any harm and we believe it
could do a . vast amount of good. Therefore
we ask that this report be adopted.
When the report of the Committee on
Conference was read by the clerk. Chair
man Curtis said he would depart from the
usual custom of having it placed on file
and would move to have it adopted. Su
pervisor Dwyer seconded the motion. Su
pervisor Fontana then arose and said he
was opposed to the motion, whereupon
Mr. Curtis gave his reasons for asking its
adoption by the board. He said in part:
APITAL and labor had its in
/f^ nings at the meeting of the Board
(I â¢ of . Supervisors yesterday af ter-
noon. The debates between the
members of the board were tor
rid, and after the smoke of battle cleared
away three things had been accomplished.
The report of the committee appointed
by the Mayor to arrange a conference
betweerr the Employers' Association and
employt-s was adopted after a heated dis
cussion. The ordinance introduced by Su
pervisor Reed asking that all special po
licemen be uniformed and the substitute
introduced by. Supervisor Samuel Braun
hart, relating to their qualifications, were
.referred to the City and County Attorney
for his opinion as to their legality.. The
resolutions introduced by Supervisor Reed
having for an object the censuring of the
Chamber of Commerce for finding fault
with the Mayor because he did not issue
a proclamation, and Police Commissioner
Newhall for his statements in public
print, were indefinitely postponed.
The strike situation showed little change yesterday. Various measures pertaining to the strike before the Board of Supervisors
were discussed, ivith the result. that the resolution censuring the Chamber of Commerce and Mayor Phelan for their attitude in the matter
of the strike zvas indefinitely postponed. The report of the conciliation committee â¢ zcas adopted. Fezv disturbances s zvere reported to the
police. Belief that the end of < the strike is near is grozving among business men.'

Provisions.
Says He Acted Professionally.
Dr. J. Depew Kergan, the physician
whose name was used in connection with
the alleged extortion scheme the discov
ery of which led to the arrest on Tuesday
of Charles Compton. Irvine Satniff and
Eugene Funk, claims that his connection
with the arrested men was of a strictK
legitimate professional nature. He was
Introduced to Compton. he says by a Da .
tient. Compton told him he was hiring a
number of men to work in a mine and
before he engaged them wanted to be' sure
they were physically sound and capable
of doing the hard work which would b*=
expected of them. Kergan says he agreed
to make Ihe necessary examinations. He
examined only one man. he says but re
ceived no money for his services, not haw.
ins arranged with Compton as to what
his compensation was to be.
CHICAGO, Sept. 1Lâ Wheat opened higher on
a Government report showing the crop of both
spring and winter wheat to be at considerable
variance with the estimates of experts, but the
lack of any outside demand entirely offset the
bullish effect of the crop bulletin and after a
momentary strength early prices gradually de
clined. The decline in corn and continued lib
eral receipts In the Northwest were also bear
features. There was a good sized export busi
ness at the seaboard with fair clearances but
absence of any considerable trading kept prices
down. December closed -%@Vfcc lower at 70*ic
A reduction in the total corn crop of .two'
thirds from the August report, as given out in
the Government report, was the cause of the
strong opening In that grain and there was
a fairly good demand during the first few min
utes of trading. On the bulge, there was. a
large amount of long stuff thrown on the mar
ket and the early advance was more than all
lost. Covering by shorts brought about a re
action of 14c. but heax-y selling: aÂ«aln carried
price 3 down. December closed %c lower at 57c
Oats opened higher in sympathy with other
grains, but were comparatively steady through
l^dmo^' December closed a sh ade higher
There was a fair trade in provisions at time*
and the opening was at steady prices -Under
the influence of grains longs disposed of much
of their holdings, causing a weaker tone Fluc
tuations were within a narrow range. Januarv
pork closed 5@7Vic lower at Â«S 72U; lard 7UV
lower at $9 10, and ribs were 6c lower
The leading futures ranged as follows:
The condition of the Prune and other fruit
crops in Oregon will be seen in the first
column. The Prune crop of the whole Pacific
Coast Is now reduced to about 90,000,000 pounds
against 1S5,000,000 pounds last year. The French
crop Is estimated at about 40,000 000 pound*
and the Turkish crop at 88,000,000 pounds and
the total output of the world this year will
be about 228,000,000 pounds, against 341 SOO 000
last year.

A circular for Australia says: "Since the
departure of the Bteamer Sierra for Australia,
August 1. there have been the following de
liveries of coal from the colonies, viz.: Dun
ferline, 4160 tons: Balasore, 4076 tons: John
Ena, 4222 tons; Lord Tsmpletown, 3116 tons;
Pelone, 1515 tons; Empereur Menelik, 2727 tons:
total. 19,816 tons. There is but one vessel
due to arrive from there in the next thirty
days. There are on the chartered list to carry
coal from Newcastle and Sydney twenty-seven
vessels with a carrying capacity of about
80,000 tons; some of these will not arrive here
before the end of the year. Thirty days ago
there were only nineteen vessels on the en
gaged list, with a carrying capacity of about
60,000 tons, hence there was an increase of about
20,000 tons during the month of August to be
loaded for this port. Last cabled reports
quoted present coal rates from Newcastle at
thirteen shillings per ton: this is an advance
of one shilling over and above the rates ruling
last month. This will serve to check tonnage
heading this way, as with the present quoted
ratee for freight Australian coal is not in de
mand as a competitor with our northern fuel.
Besides the present asking prices for New
castle ; coals will serve to keep them out of
this . market, as they are fully two shillings
per ton too high. Prior to the general consump
tion of fuel oil here, we were enabled to pur
chase, the leading brands of colonial coals at
over two shillings per ton less than they are
held at to-day, which virtually resigns the con
trol of the fuel market to oil."

CLOSING.
The stock market here to-day was firmer,
except in the . American department. These
shares, after, a steady opening, fell about half
a point from parities. The reason commonly
attributed was nervousness over the bulletin
which announced that President McKlnley had
undergone a fresh operation. Tha general
opinion is that there are more doctors around
the market than there are around Mr. Mc-
Kinley. . â¢

Condition of Trade.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"There is a very important fact which sus
tains the courage of constitutional bulls, and
that is the satisfactory condition of general
business. Clearing-house returns are much in
excess of a year aso, which considering the
inactivity of speculation is unquestionable tes
timony of trade activity. The West as a whole
seems to be enjoying exceptional prosperity In
gpite of setbacks here and there. At times it
eppears as if the country had reached the crest
of the wave of prosperity, and yet the mo
mentum has been so great that it Is prema
ture to predict with any positiveness that the
turn has ccrme. In a few markets the highest
level and the largest production have certainly
been reached; yet it seems as if other depart
ments of business must have their share of
prosperity before the turning point can be
definitely said to have been reached. At the
tame time prices of many commodities are very
high, and the profits thus induced are greatly
stimulating new competition. It Is somewhat
remarkable and not a little suggestive that in
epite of the great trusts which have been
formed during the past four er five years there
is little complaint of oppressive monopoly. Is
this because outside competition is acting as
a restraint upon these powerful corporations,
cr Is public opinion less hostile than formerly?
Very likely both factors are partly responsible
and the trust managers find It unprofitable and
unsafe to wholly disregard public opinion. An
other indication of the satisfactory condition
of business is the small number and reduced
volume cf business failures compared with
previous years. Business men are generally
anticipating a good fall trade, and it is gratify
ing to note the prevalence of a tone of con
servatism which will tend to prevent overdoing.
Of the general soundness of business there is
no question and thus far there are few or no
complaints of overproduction."
The Oregon Crops.
The weekly rerwrt of Edward A. Beals. sec
tion director of the weather bureau, reports the
condition of the Oregon crops as follows:
"Thrashing is advancing rapidly and the
yields continue good. Those reported this week
ere as follows: Lane County, wheat 25 bushels
to the acre, oats 30; Washington, wheat 20 to
SO, oats 25 to 45; Benton, wheat 25 to 35, oats
.0 to 25; Yamhill, wheat 18 to 20, oats 20 to
40; Clackamas, wheat 14 to 25. oats 25 to 45;
Linn, spring wheat 8 to 30, oats 14 to 46;
Marion, wheat IS to -42, fall oats 50 to 75. spring
cats 25 to 45; Jackson, wheat 19 to 22. oats
24 to 34, barley 06 to 45; Josephine, wheat 8
to 15. oats 15 to SO; Polk, winter wheat 21,
spring wheat 16. oats 33, barley 26.
"Hop picking has begun in Southern Oregon,
and it will begin this week in the Willamette
Valley. The hops are maturing rapidly and
the quality in all parts of the State is reported
extra good, but the yields, it is believed, will
be slightly less than those of last year. Corn
is making good advancement, but on account
cf the cool spring and subsequent dry weathtr
not over half a crop will be harvested. Early
potatoes are of good quality, free from blight,
but a short crop. Late potatoes have improved
during the week, but the crop without more
rain, followed by favorable temperature con
ditions, will fall considerably below the aver
age of former years. The third crop of alfalfa
is being cut and the yields are about the came
as usual.
"Prune picking has begTin in Southern Oregon
and it win become general throughout the
Etate in about ten days. The prunes are slight
ly undersized, but their quality is above the
average. Peaches, pears and some fall apples
ere being marketed. Although the entire crop
of fall Ir-it is not larre it is maturing nicely
and it is unusually sound and well flavored."
Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New Ycrk say: "The
utter demcralization of raisin affairs on the
coast has had its effect on the spot and loose.
Muscatels have declined >ic to 6%c for 3-crown
and 6%c for 4-crown. Actual stocks in the
hands of _ local Jobbers are understood to be
light, but" a large Philadelphia dealer is offer
ing ireely at the prices quoted. Trade, how
ever. Is closely confined to purchases for Im
mediate wants. While the president of the
Raisin Association continues his 'smashing*
tactics It is doubtful if any buyer here will
have the temerity to buy a round let of spot
raisins, unless the prices are very substantially
ehaded and an immediate outlet is in sight
for the goods. Seeded raisins continue in good
demand in a small way. There was practically
do interest in new Malaga raisins berore the
California situation became so unsettled and
naturally, in the light of recent developments
on this side of the water, prospects for Mal
agas are very discouraging. New crop Sultanas
are strong- and hlÂ£h Jn Smyrna owing to con
tinued bad weather. The local trade bought
Eultanas very slowly at the opening low prices,
but have taken considerable quantities as the
market advanced.
"Prunes are quiet on spot, with futures stag
nant. The best price on new Santa Claras
heard of at the moment is 3%c, f. o. b., coaEt
Apricots ate dull and rather easy. Peaches are
firm. Currants are easier on spot, with only
a very small demand, mostly from out of town
Amalias to arrive per first steamer are offered
to the trade at 6%<57c.
Evaporated appleg continue to decline, both
tjxyt and futures 6teadlly becoming weaker
Spot prime are pressed for sale at S%c. with
almost an utter absence of bids. Futures are
lower, sale of car of prime for October-Novem
ber delivery being made yesterday at 9c. Evap

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 11.â The organized pro
tection of the stock market by concert of the
powers was in evidence to some extent to-day.
There was much realizing on all advances by
this element of holdings acquired on Saturday
and early this week in the furtherance of pur
pose to support the market.
The realizing was accomplished probably on
a demand from uncovered shorts, as there was
no evidence of an outside Interest in the mar
ket or of a dlsDosition to accumulate stocks
by large banking interests. The position of
the market is thus restored approximately to
that which obtained before the attempt on the
President's life on every afternoon. The pur
pose to protect the market on the part of com
bined capitalists Is not changed, apparently,
but there was not the same effort shown to
advance prices or invite speculation.
The reopening- of the President's wound last
night, while it occasioned no actual uneasiness
here, seems to have affected sentiment in Lon
don, and sales here for London account had to
be taken care of on a considerable scale for
the first time In many days. The contradiction
of last night's rumors of a steel strike settle
ment resulted in a reaction in the United
States Steel stocks.
The effect of the Treasury's proposals for re
lief of the money market was confined to sur
,mise, as no statement was forthcoming as to
the amount of bonds offered or the prices
asked. There were significant advances In the
bid prices of Government bonds on call, which
carried prices of all the Government issues, ex
cept the short fours to 1% per cent over the
prices ruling before the Secretary's order.
Railroad bonds were dull and irregular. To
tal sales, par value,- $1,785,000.
United States threes advanced %, the twos
and fives % and the new -fours 1 per cent on
the last call.

The Rev. Thomas J. Shahan delivered a
very interesting lecture last evening be
fore the Catholic Truth Society at Metro
politan Hall.
The learned gentleman's discourse was
on the subject, "The Catholic Church, the
Mother of Our Modern Civilization," and
was listened to by many members of the
society.
Father Shahan. who was Introduced by
Archbishop Riordan, said: "It is a com
monplace saying that there is no social
progress possible without the recognition,
of authority in the State and a respectful
submission to its due and licit exercise.
But what avail is all this if there be no
habitual discipline In the minds and
hearts of men? It is the creation of this
docile temper, this trained submission to
just law and custom, that is one of the
great glories of the Catholic church. Tho
modern world, In so far as it possesses
this benefit, inherits it from her.
"A century of wild and incoherent ef
forts to base social obedience en any other
lines than those she preaches has resulted
In anarchy, or a practical appeal to her to
help control the masses from whose
hearts the balancing idea3 of Godâ future,
retribution, sin, immortalityâ were driven
by every Ingenious means that could be
devised! Neither Plato nor Aristotle,
neither Zeno nor Cicero nor Seneca were
able to establish a code of principles that
should command the willing and affec
tionate acceptance of all men under all
the changing circumstances of life. Only
Jesus Christ could do that."
The Rev. Thomas J. Shah an Lectures
to Large Audience at Metro
politan Hall.

At the close of the^address the Chinese
gave Ahlo a hearty round of applause.
To questions whether they enjoyed the
address and if they were in favor of tho
reform movement they all sullenly an
swered, "No sabe."
A grand rally was held in the Jackson
street Theater last evening by the Chinese
of this city who are in favor of the re
form movement now spreading through
out the Celestial empire. The theater
was packed to the doors long before a
o'clock by a motley crowd o( Chinese.
The dignified merchant in silken gown
and with lingers flashing with costly
rings elbowed and Jostled the highbinder
with stiff-brimmed hat and clothes reek-
Ing with the odor of opium. The weary
house servant for a night had foregone
the pleasures of the gambling table and
struggled in the aisles to work his way
close up to the stage.
A. L. Ahlo, a son of a wealthy Chinese
merchant of Honolulu, was the lecturer.
He has just returned from England,
where he has been studying for the last
three years. Â¦ He Is a graduate of Cam
bridge and speaks English perfectly. Ho
appeared In evening dress, and he wore
the latest creation in evening pumps.
The address was delivered in English
and was translated Into Chinese by Us
Poon Chew, editor of the Chinese daily
paper. -Previous to the appearance of the
lecturer the master of ceremonies spoka
a few words in Chinese and the auditors
immediately removed their hats.
"I am glad to see so many zealous
workers here to-night," said Ahlo. "Many
among you I know suffer privations which,
are due alone to the misrule of the Chi
nese Government; The Chinese Govern
ment is a disgrace in this day of enlight
enment. We must be ready as patriots
to sacrifice our lives and wealth if neces
sary for the good of our country.
"Our countrymen far across the Pacific
Ocean look to- you for assistance and for
encouragement. We hoped for the regen
eration of China, but we have been dis
appointed. Our country, I am sorry to
say, is full of corruption. It is a nation
disgraced. I feel and you feel the degra
dation keenly. When the late war
was over we were promised re
form. We â¢ did not get It, and
the people of China are gradually sinking
back to their normal state of misery. Tho
people must at once shake off the yoke of
slavery. They are too easily beguiled by
false promises. It is now time to awaken
and bestir ourselves."

Two hundred thousand dollars' worth
of gold dust came down by the Hating
to-day. A large share was owned by
Frank C. Brown of Vancouver, who has
been in the north since 1898. Mrs. R.
Wcissman brought out several large
packages of dust from an El Dorado
claim that she owns.
The Increased business has caused al
most unlimited rate-cutting on the Yukon
River between Dawson and White Horse.
People from Nome and away down the
Yukon, as well as from the city of Daw
son itself, are coming out to civilization
for the winter months. Large mine own
ers and those immediately interested
probably will stay In the country, only the
surplus population having the longing for
the delights of the outside.
Hereafter summer diggings will not be
relied upon in the Klondike to produce
much of the mineral returns, The miners
will go back to the winter method of
thawing out the ground and having a big
dump ready for treatment during tho
Epring freshet. This summer the clean
up would have been ' much â¢ larger had
work begun sooner, but by tho time
dumps had grown to a respectable size
there was no water with which to handle
them. ' .-
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 11.â There
will bb an unprecedented rush from Daw
son during September and early In Octo
ber. Every berth was taken on the
steamer Hating, which arrived here this
morning from Skaguay, and other steam
ers en route to Puget Sound are equally
crowdc-d. This Is only the commencement
of the rush, which probably will keep up
at the rate of 100 persona a day, from now
until the close of navigation on the upper
river.

my mind the record of your fidelity to the
Interests of the patients in the home and your
uniform good nature and. loyal , response to all
duties Imposed upon you. The memory of your
devotion to the Interests of. the patients will
never fade, but shall ever' be the brightest
thing In all our remembrances oÂ£ the yeara
passed In the institution.
As you have beâ¬*i faithful in the past I
charge you to be faithful in the future. Let
me ask you to lay aside all personal feeling
and accept with patience that which has come
to us in the course of events. ! Remember your
first duty is to the patients and you can do no
higher nor nobler work than to continue your

interest in, so long, as your services may be
needed by the management now In control.
God will reward you for this.

Twenty Handsome Young
Women Will Keep Record
of Points for the Players
The ladies' basket-ball, contest of last
week at the Chutes and Zoo proved so
popular an attraction that it will be re
peated this evening-. The usual amateur
entertainment will also be given.
Von Suppe's "Beautiful Galatea" Is the
chief attraction of Fischer's good bill this
week, and Ma-? Tunison. Wren and Lin
den, Merle Stanton, June Mathlas and
Sam Holdsworth also help to make the
programme an unusually good one.
George W . Leslie and company, Ernest
Hogan. Libby, Trayer and Gilbert, the
five Sunbeams, the La VaJlee Trio, Mile,
Letty and the great Powell and his com
pany are the Orpheum people of the
week in a record programme. The Her
ald prize farce "Chums," with George W
Leslie and his company, is of the best of
vaudeville and keeps the audience in high
humor throughout its swift pro
gress. Ernest Hogan is a wonder at a
coon song:, and the La Vallee trio has a
refined musical turn that pleases all hear
ers. The rest of the bill is all good, and
the biograph should not be missed.
* * â¢
. . T J lere is a very sprightly production of
"The Taming of the Shrew" this week at
the Alcazar, with Florence Roberts as
Katherine and White Whittlesey as Pe
truchio. The actor and actress are very
well supported by the Alcazar people, and
Ehakespeare"s comedy has been much
more indifferently given with companies
of a considerably larger reputation. The
piece is costumed and mounted in the
best style of the house and is drawing
large audiences.
"A oice From the Wilderness" contin
ues to crowd the house at the Central
Theater, and the big production is run
ning- more smoothly with each perform
ance. The elaborate and splendid mount-
Ings of the play have aroused the utmost
admiration, and the drama itself is getting
into shape and order. Robert Downing-
Annette Marshall. Robert Cumminprs.
Minnie Downing and Oza Waldrop all add
greatly to the play's effect.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The popular Neill company at the Cali
fornia Theater will give "The Jilt" at this
afternoon's matinee and also to-night.
The farewell performance to-morrow
evening will be "The Lottery of
Love." "The -Jilt" is one of the best of
fered during the engagement, and it is to
be regretted that more performances of
the bright comedy were not given- After
the Xeills comes the Durno-Emmett com
bination of "mirth, music, mimicry, mag
ic," with Richard J. Jose, the famous
contra tenor, as attraction extraordinary.
The Durno-Emmett engagement begins on
Saturday night.
The Tivoli has a bill this week that is
of the best the house can give, with the
Collaroarini Carmen, and "-Faust" with
Dado's splendid Mephisto and the fine
Faust of Agoscini. The house has been
filled to Its utmost capacity and both bills
seem to be pood for much more than the
accustomed four performances. The fa
vorite barytone, Salassa, and Montanari
are also heard to good advantage in the
Gounod opera, and Russo, Ferrari and
Repetto add the Interest of their best ef
fort to "Carmen." which is the bill for
tonight. To-morrow evening "Faust"
Jl be repeated.

Monday evening next to "A Modern Cru
eoe> 'Â¦Â£Â¦ new com ic romantic play by Syd
ney Rosenfeld. "A Royal Family," with
Annie Russell and Mr. Frohman's clever
band of players, has undoubtedly been the
most artistic and finished production of
the season, and the appreciation Is now
keeping pace with the merit of the play.
Mr. Rosenfeld's play is the subject of
much pleasant conjecture, his bright Ger
man comedy "At the White Horse Tav
ern." given here last year at the Califor
nia Jjy a good little company of unfa
miliar players, having left a most pleas
ing impression. Thomas Q. Seabrooke is
the hero of the present play, and among:
his supporting company is Miss Isabel
Evesson.
Joseph Haworth Is giving us this week
a stirring and virile picture of Viniclus in
"Quo Vadis," that goes far to make a
very uneven performance well worth see
?*Â¥ , 2^;, Haworth Â» methods are through
out legitimate and artistic, and in two
Uases his support is worthy of the star.
p :ss Laura Neison Hall as Lygia has
'fciven us a gracious and tender conception
of tho part, and Herschel Mayalls good
Ic-tronluB has aW added greatly to the
interest. Some o^ the scenes fully live up
to the notable reputation of the house for
scenic (splendors, and Mr. Haworth's

LONGSHOREMEN RETURN*
TO JOBS IN OAKLAND
Union Goes to Work Handling Lum
ber and Breaks Its Sympa
thetic Strike.
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â So far as the
Longshoremen's Union of Oakland is con
cerned the sympathetic strike on this side
of the bay is off. To-day 150 members of
that union returned to work, and at all
of, the yards along the water front lum
ber was being handled without respect to
union or' non-union relations.
The embargo on the schooner Muriel,
which has been idle at the Puget Sound
Lumber Company's docljs, was raised,
and the longsnoremen began to handle the
lumber cargo from that vessel. At all of
the other yards the same condition exist
ed, and the* cargo movers were as busy
as during the days before the strike.
This union is not affiliated with the
Water Front Federation of San Fran
cisco and is not officially affected by any
action taken by that body. The union
was Induced to join the teamsters in the
strike as a purely sympathetic proposi
tion, there being no grievance here con
cerning hours or wages.* .
Business Agent Nielsen, of the "Long
shoremen's Union made the following
statement: Â¦
"About 150 union longshoremen have re
turned to work. I told the boys this morn
ing they either had to go to work or
every .lumber handler in the yards and
out -of them would be called out. The
men in the yards have been working regu
larly at a weekly wage schedule. The
longshoremen, who .at best get only a
few days' work at a time, have been idle
now for six weeks. They have earned no
money and-- have received no assistance
from the Water Front Federation of San
Francisco. More than that, money has
been raised here and sent to the city
strikers. - . Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ .
â¢ "Not a cent of Jt came to the strikers
here. I am better situated than some of
the men,' but' I can't stand this any long
er. All of us must go out or all of ug
must be permitted to work.'
"If the San Francisco Federation would
assist us we would air go out. If we get
no relief.it will be a case of. every man
for : himself." .
Longshoremen working on' the â¢ docks
said the teamsters and stevedores had
been handling S coal I without interruption
and the â¢ yard men had been working on
lumber despite the strike. Therefore, . the
longshoremen had decided to go back to
their jobs on the promise that all or none
of the union men should strike. - '
â¢ The. longshoremen had expected the
Building Trades Council to take some ac
tion last night, -but" the- council did not
make a move. The building trades have
shown no desire' to precipitate a labor war
in Oakland, and as the supplies of lumber
upon which they are* dependent were be
coming short the council would take no
step calculated to further tie up the' local
conditions. ' ,â Â¦ Â¦".-'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
'The longshoremen returned to their
places without attempting ' to enforce any
regulations concerning hours or wages.*
George Rice Uses His Gun and Saves
:;;Â¦Â«Â¦Â¦- . ., Himself From Injury. ~
,,George : KIce, a non-union machinist liv
ing at Twentieth and Shotwell streets and
employed â¢ at > the < Golden State foundry,
231 First street, was attacked about 9
o'clock last ; night at Fourth and Howard
streets by, five strikers: - Rice shook him
self clear, of: the attacking party before he
had serious injury, and -pulling
his revolver opened fire. He fired four
shots. The strikers scattered. Policeman
J. Jordan, who was oft* duty, happened to
be in the neighborhood and ran to the
scene of the shooting. Rice covered the
policeman with his gun, but submitted to
arrest when the latter exhibited his star.
Rice was taken to the Southern police
station, but was released upon explain
ing the circumstances. He showed a per
mit to carry firearms. It is not known
whether any of his bullets did any dam
age. Rice was employed at the foundry
long before the strike. He has always re
fused to join any union, and when the
union hands went out he told them that
he was satisfied with his job and would
stick by the ship.
SMITH IS RELEASED.
Case of Huffernan's Assailant Con
tinued Till Saturday.
Alvin Smith, the striking stationary en
gineer charged with assault to murder
upon Fred Huffernan, engineer for Healy,
Tibbitts & Co., last Saturday even
ing by striking him on the head with an
iron bar near his home, 1310 Green street,
appeared before Judge Cabaniss yester
day. He was instructed as to his rights,
and his attorney, E. P. Shortall, said he
was ready to proceed.
Attorney Coffey, for the prosecution,
said that the complaining witness was in
a serious condition at his home, and pre
sented a certificate from Dr. George
Adams to that effect. It was impossible,
therefore, to proceed at present with the
case. In view of the doctor's certificate
he asked that the bail of $250 accepted by
Assistant Warrant Clerk John J. Gree
ley for Smith's arrest be increased, as he
considered it entirely inadequate for such
a serious charge.
The proposed increase was opposed by
Attorney Shortall, but the Judge said he
would personally communicate with Dr.
Adams and be guided by his report. . The
case was continued till 2 o'clock, when
the Judge said that, although Dr. Adams
expressed the opinion that Huffernan
might eventually live, there was a pres
sure on the brain which left a chance for
fatal results. In the circumstances he
thought it his duty to increase the ball to
{500 cash or $1000 bonds. The case was
continued till Saturday.
Smith was soon released on $1000 bonds
accepted by Assistant Warrant Clerk
Greeley. The bondsmen were George
Monahan, bridge builder, 1746 Sanchez
street, and William Forster, bridge build
er, 100 Mateo street. Each qualified on
their residences, each being valued at
$2500, but in Monahan's case there is a
mortgage of $1200 on the property.
John Tuite, the striking longshoreman,
accused of robbing Fred E. Wehr, one of
Curtin's special officers, at the headquar
ters of the longshoremen at Fourth and
Berry streets September 1, was able to
prove an alibi to the satisfaction of Judge
Fritz yesterday and the case was dis
missed. About a dozen witnesses testi
fied that Tuite could not have been at the
headquarters of the union at the time of
the alleged robbery.
The case of Andrew Hagar, a striking
teamster, charged with battery upon W.
R. Van Brunt, a non-union teamster, was
dismissed by Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
Attorney Coffey, who appeared as special
prosecutor, said the complaining witness
could not be found, and without him a
conviction could not be secured. .
Maurice Pohalski. one of Curtin's spe
cial, officers, who was convicted by Judge
CaBaniss of disturbing the peace at
Stockton and Ellis streets Sunday after
noon, appeared for sentence yesterday.
As he had been in prison since, the Judge
fined him $20, with the alternative of five
days in jail. _"Â¦-.... - â¢
SLATE-MAKING BEGINS
IN UNION LABOR ' PARTY
Ex-Supervisor Britt Is Said to Be on
the Programme for the May
oralty Nomination.
, In the convention of the Union Labor
party there are several active wire-work
ers who graduated from Chris Buckley's
political academy. The convention was
adjourned for one week in order to give
the manipulators an opportunity to get in
their fine work. On the slate for Mayor
is - written the name of ex-Supervisor
Britt. Inside intelligence is to the effect
that he will win the nomination. A strong
pressure is exerted in favor of nominating
Richard" I. Whelan for Sheriff. There is
talk that Whelan may get the indorse
ment of the Democratic convention.
T/he Republican convention will meet
next Monday evening. The name of Nor
man W. Hall has been added to the list of
aspirants for the honor of chairmanship.
. The list of prospective candidates for
Mayor has been extended by the addition
of A. i Chesebrough's name. He served the
people -creditably as a member of the
State Board of Equalization, and is well
known as a capable Republican of good
business attainments.

STAMPEDES HIS ASSAIL ANTS.
Must all efforts toward amelioration then
be given up in despair? Must the existing an
tagonism with all its accompanying unrest and
suffering continue? I do not believe it. How
then, you ask, will the reconciliation be
brought about? Upon what terms will peaca
be established? Not, I am sure, by perpetuat
ing the existing conditions of mutual distrust
and hatred. Not by capital continuing to oc
cupy its present attitude of taking unto itself
all the earnings of labor. leaving to the laborer
merely the means of bare existence. Not by
labor restricting by the power of its unions the
common rights of all who work, and attempt
ing by strikes, accompanied more or less by
violence, to enforce its demands. The remed"
must be sought through broader paths of
justice. It must be found in the peaceful and
orderly exercise of those powers which the con
stitution and the laws of the country confer
upon every man as an Inalienable attribute of
his citizenship. By legislation has every step
in the advance of the working classes been ac
complished and by law must all its future con
quests be achieved. The remedy Is in their
own hands. It is lawful, it is just, it is ef
ficacious, it is Irresistible. Upon their own
intelligence and virtue does its efficacy, depend.
" Under no form of tyranny can ths aspira
tions of humanity toward peace and happiness
be realized. And what guarantee can unified
labor afford that when it has reached to ths
height of the power of absolute dictation it
will not be as tyrannical as the trusts them
selves? Â¦ s*
Speaking on the hypothesis that the
trusts must ultimately yield to the de
mands of united labor. Delmas asked.
"Will the millennium have arrived when
that epoch ia reached? Believe It not,"
he replied. Continuing, he said:
At the outset of the lecture Delmas de
fined the word "trust." He said it repre
sents a union of individuals acting: in con
cert under the form of a corporation for
the purpose of acquiring all or at least
sufficient to give them control of the
means and instruments of production and
distribution of a given branch of business
with a view to obtaining- thereby and,
turning to their own advantage the profits
of a monopoly.
Delmas was Introduced to the audience
by the Rev. J. P. Turner, acting rector
of the church. He was given a warm wel
come, and without any preliminary re
marks took up the discussion of the ques
tions of the day. Delmas discussed the
problem presented by the conflict between
unified labor and centralized capital. How
can this conflict be avoided and is there
any common ground upon which human
ity can meet and live in peace was a ques
tion which he answered in the affirmative.
He next discussed at length the attitude
which the forces placed in antagonism.
occupy. The speaker, gave evidence- of
having made an exhaustive examination
of the subject. He quoted from the works
of the foremost writers on economics and,
read pithy passages from articles written
by Charles M. Schwab and other trust
magnates.
D. M. Delmas, the well known attorney,
delivered a highly interesting lecture on
the "Combination of Labor and Capital**
before the Men's Club of the CathÂ«tral
Mission of the Good Samaritan last even
ing. The subject was exhaustively treat
ed by the speaker, and throughout the
reading of the brilliant paper his auditors
gave him the most earnest attention.

Present Conflict Is in

"The price of handling grain in Port
Costa has already been increased 20 per
cent," he said. "The farmers have to
stand this advance. Besides, the work is
progressing slowly. Along the banks of
the river grain. is piled up and millions
of sacks are awaiting transportation.. If
we should ship apart of it now the barges
would be tied up at the Port Costa docks,
as the men there can move only a limited
quantity at a time and the rest would
have to run the chances of rain. Contra
Costa County has no fund wherewith to
pay deputy sheriffs, and although a num
ber are paid by the big grain shippers
they are inadequate to afford sufficient
protection. There are plenty of men in
the fields who would go there and load
and unload the grain if they were afford
ed sufficient protection." -
voked to prevent, loss to the farmer, and,
through the, farmer, to the State?
. If the farmer, cannot market, his grain
. how is he to pay his taxes?" is a question
each one is asking. The answer invariably
comes, "Let the State furnish the neces
sary protection, no matter what shape It
may take, or we will have to furnish the
protection for ourselves." . -â¢ ;
A. Hochheimer of Hochheimer Bros, of
Willows came up from San Francisco to

the metropolis only made the farmers
more determined upon the one course that
seems possible at the present time.

Attorney Edward R. Shirran was the
victim of an assault and robbery about 3
o'clDck yesterday afternoon at the corner
of Dur.bar alley and Merchant street, ad
joining the Central police station.
Shirran had been at the Hall of Justice
attending to some business and was walk
ing along Merchant street to Montgomery
when he *as accosted hy two men at the
corner of the alley. They asked him to
give tbem a drink, but lie said he was not
in the habit of drinking with strangers.
One of them put his hands on Shirran' s
ehouliitrs in a familiar way and drew his
hands down until he reached the lawyer's
vest pockets.
Shirran resented the man's familiarity
but before he could get away from him
the stranger abstracted about S3 in silver
which was in ore 'of the attornev's vest
pockets. The silver had jingled when the
man e hand came in contact with the
pocket.
cKÂ« Here * wh^ are you <*oing?" demanded
v rr ?. n^ P he nade a era* for the rob
ber. Take that." was the retort, and he
was struck a violent blow on the mouth
k?Â«rfc^ii hIl U llp severe Â»y nearly
knocked him dewn. The two men then
ran down Merchant street.
Shirran reported the assault and rob-
The Devotos are well known in this city
James. Devoto being a prominent attorney!
Dr. Perrone is equally well known, having
practiced his profession here for years
bery at. the Central police station, but by
that time the two robbers had disap
peared. , The lawyer- was able to give a
good description of them and says he will
swear out warrants for their aVrest this
morning. He went to a doctor on Kearny
street and had five stitches put in the
wound on his lip.
The suit filed yesterday is an outgrowth
of former litigation. The complaint in the
first suit alleged that the death of Lillian
Devoto was due to the criminal neglect
and willful carelessness of Dr. Perrone
Although the case was dismissed on the
motion of the plaintiffs Dr. Perrone claims
that his reputation has been damaged to
the extent of the sum named in his com
plaint.
Dr. Osea Perrone entered suit for $10,250
damages yesterday against Antonio De
voto. Caterina Devoto and James Devoto,
claiming that they had damaged him to
that extent by suing him some months
ago for damages for the death of Lillian
Devoto, whom he had treated.

SACRAMENTO, , Sept. , 11.â The State
Dairymen's Association met this morning
in the Senate chamber and was* called to
order by ex-Senator William Johnston,
the president. Samuel E. Watson was
secretary. Judge Peter J. Shields deliv
ered an address of welcome to the mem
bers Mrs. Roussel*responded.
President Johnston then delivered his
address, which bristled : with 'important'
and interesting statistics concerning- the
industry. C. G. Hill spoke in relation to
methods of conducting the competition in
dairy products.
. In -.the afternoon Judge Shields was'
unanimously elected president and Samuel
E. Watson secretary. It was decided to
meet in San . Francisco within the. next
two- months, when three, committees of
two members each- will be appointed, one'
to bring about a large exhibit- of dairy
cattle at the next State fair; the second
to produce a large and complete exhibit
of dairy machinery and the third to en
deavor, to obtain the largest -exhibit of
dairy products, ever shown in California.
Judge Shields Is Elected President of
:.. the Association.

It is proposed, as far as the details had
been worked out up to -midnight, to have

One of the most important conferences
of the grain growers of California will be'
held in the courthouse here at 1:30 o'clock
to-morrow. Means will then be taken to
put an end to the blockade at Port Costa
and elsewhere. The meeting was called
at the instance of the Sacramento,,,Val
ley Development Association, and an in
vitation has been extended the San Joa
quin Valley Commercial Association, of
which Hon. C. S. Smith of Kern County
is president. Telegrams from Senator
Smith indicate a large attendance. ',:Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11â "As to
the strike, from the interviews
I have had . with farmers and
handlers of grain, their tem
pers are such that they, will ask the :
Governor to send a company of State
militia to Port Costa by Monday,
next, and if he refuses, they, the far-:
mers of California, will be there with
their shotguns and rifles before Tues-'
day next to see that their grain, now
lying unprotected in the fields, is sent
down and loaded on the waiting
ships. No farmer, they say, can af
ford to see the whole crop of a year
destroyed, as is now threatened by n
lot of irresponsible strike leaders."
Thus spoke Will S. Green,' president of
the Sacramento Valley Development As
sociation, to a number of \ the largest
farmers of the State on his arrival from
San Francisco to-night. And . Green's
words were commended by every one
present, many of whom after years of
toil find it impossible to get their grain
to tidewater and tee financial ruin staring
them in the face. ,
Among the largest grain farmers here
at present are: James Hart, William
Kelly or Princeton. James Boyd P R
Garnetl, Willows; Vincent Click, Orland;
William Howell, Jesse Poundstone, H D
Strother. J. H. Balsdon. H. R. Pound
stone, W. H.' Stapp, Grand Island; John
F.. Able, Williams; F. C. Lusk, Chk-o;
John Shepy, P. Peterson. Sites; J. H
Glide, Maxwell; Herman Schutz, Av
buckle; S. G. Little. H. E. McCune. Dixon,
and Henry Jameson, John Browning an'l
DukeMcVey, whose farms lie in Colusa,
Glenn and Yolo counties.
While the farmers are engaged in mak
ing the necessary investigations for a
change, these two associations, represent
ing the majority, of the grain, growers of
the State, have called the meeting for
consultation. No definite plan- has yet
been prepared for consideration, but it is
much easier for ail the farmers of the
State to put their, wheat together and
have it handled and sold by .a board of
direstors than it is* for the -growers of
either prunes or raisins to do so., There
are but three grades of grain that are
marketable, hence all grain can be put
into three bins, which cannot be done
with either prunes or raisins. If the banks
or the State could be Induced to loan
money on the association's certificate-*,
such an association would be entirely
practicable." Â¦ â¢ :

THE SAlf , FK ANCISCO CAXL, ; THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1901.
Another subject that is \ of great con
cern Is the weather. A continuance of
the present dry spell till the first of Octo
ber, coupled with the determination of
the farmers, would materially relieve the
blockade, but this is a contingency that
none cares to rest upon.
Yet another proposition ' that will be
glven^consideration-is the formation of a
farmers' exchange, " by which the . three
grades of marketable grain can be ex
peditlously handled. Speaking of this
project President Green said:
"The conditions in the valleys are such
that a permanent organization of farmers
is necessitated, with powers to handle
conditions as they arise. The present
price of grain, taking into consideration
Interest on the investment, wear and tear
of machinery, etc., has now reached a
point below the cost of production for the
average farmer. It is entirely impossible
to change the products of a county in one
year or in a decade; hence the necessity
has arisen for the farmer to see if some
thing cannot be done to bolster up the
industry.
