all so very jolly that they did not notice
how the wind was swirling- the clouds
down from the mountains until everything
began to darken arcund them. Then there
was a hurrying. Mamie took the helm
again while Kay shortened sail and tli*.n
rushed below to stew things which might
carry av.-ay when the sea rose.
By the time he had fin'shed th!s th?
wind had Increased so that Mamie was
braced with all her strength to keep the
helm up, and the boat was tearing
through the water, throwing spray clear
back to the companionway as she butted
against the head seas. Ray brought up
an overcoat for Mamie and an oilskin
sou'wester that became" her more than
any spring hat she had ever worn. At
least it seemed so to him as he tied the
strings under her chin, that was tipped
up so childishly to the touch of his strong
hands. Before long there was work
enough for both of them, for It is no easy
task to keep a little short chunky vessel
headed anywhere within four points of
where she ought to be, when there is a
choppy sea and a flawy wind.
The darkness came on imperceptibly,
the coast outline disappearing bit by bit
and the shore lights taking its place, cut
out now and then by the lowering clouda.
Ray went below and lit the little bin
nacle light that shone blood-red on the
compass card, its. ruby light not in the
least blinding their eyes to the darkness

.At last the whale tired of teasing, and
when he had left. them -i..e storm alone

increasing light .making it safe for them
to run close to shore, -they, found a beau

overhung the water. They were now
across the British line. The storm 'was
gone, they were^ safe from irate parents.
The world was theirs, and they were each
others and alone. .. ;
.The anchor was dropped, the 'sails low
ered, and soon the blue smoke of Mhe
galley fire was curling iazily around' the
mast befcre, floating away through the
tired. atmosphere that sagged listlessly In
its rest after' the wild storm o'f the. night
before!. No less delightful than'.the scen
ery was the sizzling sound that came from
good things' on the galley stove below.
. .Breakfast over, the young pair, exhaust
ed- with their long ; struggle' against ;Â¦ the
storm/; slept the entire day. j
.The experience of the storm had shown
them that their boat was" seaworthy.- and '
to be relied upon in; their long joiirnew
from' civilization upon which they were,
starting.
Not till then had they realized what is
and always has been the. dream of lowers.
They were alone in the world. Around
thorn was the blac<c night.' All the" World;
anil sky was black except that little rod
lighted compass card with its white face
lined 'with the thirty-two black points of
the comnass. Just enough of its rays ;
shone upen them to assure each that the
other wa-s still there. The storm might
do, do. might do its worst. They were
together and - they were' happy. . Ray
knew the Waters of the sound as he knew
the way through his own house, and the.
yacht while small was as seaworthy as
a^lifebcat.
The evening wore on, the beat clashing
from wave to wave, splashing and roar
ing enouch to deaden all "sounds, until
suddenly-there came from in front- of
them a hearse blowing ntrtse as of a
steamboat's escape pipe.
"A whale," said Ray, and changed the
course of the boat. to avoid its apparent
direction. Before they had . sailed long,':
again came the noise, still ahead of them.
and in a new direction. Again he 'changed
the boat's course, and then' It seemed ,a3
though the whale had deliberately start-'
ed in to tease - them, first on the- port'
bow, then on the starboard; then, just
to make them think- they were "safe, he
would drop back and they would' hear' his'
blowing close on their quarter;^ close
enough " to make them think that a blow.:
The first storm. was followed. by others.
In aU of them Mamie took her"_ turn at
the helm with her husband, strong and
Brave to face the flying snray.
* More storms followed, but by this time
they were w'ell into 'the inland passage,
and little harbors were to.be found when
ever shelter was -wanted. The days were
lengthening .with the increased/ northins
which they were making, and- days and
nights both they sailed, one keeping the
boat on tier 'course while the other slept.
For aboat as small as theirs there was
little choice as to which channel ' should
be' taken, and in most of the parts of the
way ,-' there -were two or three courses
open. Fish, halibut especially, were plen
tiful, and. like all Alaskans, they ate fish
untii surfeited with the delicious, firm
rr.eated specimens that they pulled out ev
ery day with their hooks and lines while
trolling as the boat. sr.iied. slowly. .

That was gTeat fun, too. Gol^g ashore

ashore on an island for fresh water Ray
*aw the ' track : of j a deer. Thinking : the
plact! A'as so small that he could not miss

from a pitch-pine log, and, waiting until
it got as near dark as the northern lati
tudes approach in- midsummer, he start
ed with his rifle to secure the. game.
Lighting one of the splints of pitch pine
he began carefully beating his way
through the woods, always going to wind
ward and trusting to the curiosity of the
deer to bring it out of Its hiding place to
see what, manner of thing a moving light
was. . ,
Eefore he had been gone long he was
rewarded by seeing '.a pair of 'blazing
globesâ the eyes of the* deer reflecting the
lightâ which blinked and shook as the im

where : It would not blind his sight, he
aimed at the lurid circles and fortunately
brought down the deer, which proved to
be in fairly eood condition for the early
season.
-This gave them an agreeable variety,
and with .the ever-plentiful fish enabled
them to eet through to Pyramid harbor.
Here, lost to the world for the whole
summer, they, honeymooned " to their
hearts' content. At times the diet Was"
clams and nothing else.
Ray was prospecting, and as his wife
could not follow on his hard trips he built
a shelter for her on the beach, and tak
ing the little yacht would sail away across
the harbor and be gone for a week at a
time. - >Â«":?;
Successful in love, he failed In his
search for cold.
'The relatives of both at home had long:
given them up for "dead, as they found by
newspaper reports which reached them.
' The cold of the Arctic winter was ap
proaching before they began Â«their home

them by the fact that they had no money,
and there was no alternative. They could

Storm succeeded storm, but they were

They, were bashful about returning to

Kay sent his wife home to her grand

which winds its many channels from Pu
get Sound to Alaska.
That was an elopement worth reading
about.
Ray Ovijatt of Seattle was a sailor bey.
19 years old. and the lass that loved a
sailor was lS-year-old Mamie Gridell. who
lived dcw;n by the bay wtih her grand
mother.
Bay was beardless and brown, with
lithe form and lauching face. As he
sailed in his boat on the bay Mamie's blue
eyes watched him with ever ( increasing
emotions as lie departed each time from
her view.;
Later orrthey niefand sailed together:
Kay taught Mamie to steer and bow to let
BO the jib sheets incoming about while
he was forward attending to the anchor.
Then when sailing out on the sound he
gave her instructions in all the arts of
sailor craftâ how to luff quickly and ease
off the sheets when struck by a flaw from
the mountains, and how to jibe without
cracking the main boom or her own head
â until at" last she could stand her watch
alone with self-reliance.
Venus was sea-born, the Greeks said,
and still she rises from the sea when man
and maid appear. Puget Sound is net less
beautiful, than the Ionian Â£ea, and Venus
is not the goddess cf the Greeks only. She
cast her witchery over the two who sailed
on the summer days, and then came an
tngagement and the storm at home when
it was announced.
Ray's parents rased. His father used
language; his mother tears.
Mamie's grandmather said not much.
Only that "Mamie was all she had.
Ray was undtr age and needed his pa
rents' consent. Bi-t the spell of Venus
Â¦was over them and love will find a way.
There is one thing that a girl will do. She
may be weak and vacillating in every
thing: else 1 , but when once she gets the
Idea of marriage into her head it is there
to stav. â¢
One clay when they were out on the bay:
" *Mf m-e could only Eiiil on forever like
this." said one.
"Why not?" said the other.
"Why not?" said both.
The next thins was to prepare. Mam!e
began by packing her trunk a little at a
time in a hiding place which Ray had
found for her. Piece by piece she trans
ported the bits of her wardrobe that was^
to be her trousseau.
He at the same time commenced laying
in a Ftore o* provisions.
It was the most fun in the world, and no
one knew a thin:: about it but^the two.
"When Ray added a sack of flour Mamie
would show him a pillowcase that she
had made. Then she would turn red and.
think perhaps she should not have shown
It, and then they would both laugh. When
It came to buying the coffee Ray had to
ask her what kind she liked, for they
Â¦were both live, healthy people and drank
coffee instead of bran tea boiled bard for
fifteen minutes.
Then they both laughed aga,in, for Ma
mie had never had any one ask her what
kind of coffee they should buy, and she
didn't know and Ray did not either.
At last the time came when the pro
visions were all stored In the secret hid
ing place.. The little trousseau that Ma
mie had together, made and
pieced out. was all ready, and then one
day Ray Â£ot a friend to go with him to
the Courthouse and help him Bet ihe mar
riage license. He could not have asked
for It himself.
It's funny how hard it Is to say seme
things without giggling and looking green,
and the idea of having to ask a fat politi
cal clerk for license to marry a girl whom
he never caw was too much for the would
be groom,. The license obtained, there
â¢was a wait until one auspicious evening,
when the. young; couple went out fcr a
to whoever was below to come up and see
something or do something, for it wotifd
be awfully lonesome fcr them if they
didn't. There was real danger, too. to be
apprehended -every _time a launch or
steamer appeared to be coming aftt-r
them, for there was no telling who might
be in the beats or what their intentions
were. And. besides, it was so much more
fun to thirk that they were being pursued
even if it was unlikely that their abrf'en-:e
would-be so soon noted. The first rr.e'il
was eaten sitt'ns out in the cockpit. Ma
mie served it all on a tray and sat with
it on her, knees, while Ray steered v,-iih

And, of course, it goes without saying
that whoever was at the helm could not
leave it and so they would have" to call
It was a happy, busy, nervous time for
them. Mamie steered while Ray stoweJ
the anchor and made things snug for
ward. Then, after he had adjusted the
heavier boxes and thirgs in the cabin,
. he took the helm and Mamie started m

cabin, giving those little touches and

Then :t was Ray's turn again to go and
build the galley fire so that Mamie could
cock their dinner.
"Down the sound the voyp.sre was un
eventful." said Ray Oviatt in describing
the beginning of his journey, which shuivs
how the greatest event of a man's life
may fail to impress him with its signifi
cance.
So. less fearing stormy seas than

ONE THOUSAND
MILES IN A TINY SLOOP
FOR A BRIDAL TOURGERONIMO IS TURNING "GOOD INDIAN" IN HIS OLD AGE.
T..THOUGH by no means a dead
/Lj\ Indian or likely to be one for a
II plong time to come from all appear
ances,, Geronimo, the famous war
rior, is a good Indian nowadays. Not
from choice, however, for it bores him
extremely. The reason he is good Is that,
as a prisoner of war at Fort Sill, Okla
homa, he has to be. He who was once
the meanest and most bloodthirsty In
dian chief that ever fought the Govern
ment, now leads a quiet and peaceful life
that is in striking contrast to the old
days. In fact he is rather proud of it.
In moments of confidence he admits that
he wouid like to do it all over again. One
of the things over which he gloats is that
he personally has killed ten whites in a
single battle. It is also a matter of pride
to his old age that he has led forays
wherein as many as DOO palefaces were
slaughtered. He has a deep-set, 6red-in
the-bone taste for murder. . .
Such is Geronimo's English that it is
well to hire an interpreter if one desires
to get an intelligent talk out of him. Also
it is necessary to hire Geronimo. He does
not talk for nothing, a fact of which the
writer was apprised immediately upon
questioning him. A dollar bill loosened
his tongue, but to the first question asked
how he liked his present position, he gave
answers rather difficult - to reconcile.
â¢First, he liked the place. Then he said
that the soldiers treated him badly. As
a corollary, he added that he wished to
die. In the subsequent conversation his
allegations^of ill-treatment and his pin
ing for death cropped out with suspicious
frequency. It is said by the officers that
he repeats this to all white visitors,
whereby -their pity is aroused and Â¦ they
buy his beadwork and trinkets at an ad
vance over, the market rates.
Apparently the old chief has t p easy
and pleasant life. The officers at the fort
treat him with kindness and consideration,
allowing him all the privileges possible
under the rules governing the conduct of
prisoners of war. His position is peculiar
in this respect, that although. a prisoner
he is also a paid employe of the.Govern
ment. He draws $35 per month as a
scout, though he is not permitted to carry
a loaded gun; -' He has no work to do and
spends most of his time making bead
work arid other fancy articles to sell white
visitors. ; ...
Out of this trade, the soldiers think, he
makes no less than $2000 a year.I <When
asked if he had any money laid by for "a
rainy day,, he replied in his guttural
lish: â¢ ' , . . . .
"Me no save money.-' Me spend it for
Eva. squaws and heap gladness. Me like
to have gladness and see fun." .;
Eva is his favorite - daughter. . By
squaws he means his wjves. In the In
dian ' vernacular gladness is synonymous
Â¦with gambling, and a great deal | of the
old man's money goes into the gameand
never comes out againi He is a very poor
gambler/so far as winning goes." but he
plays with that unfailing courage which,
when coupled with* skill, makes the most
successful gamesters. .
He is , a reckless better and runs a ,
strong bluff. He never hesitates about a
bet and if you raise him' he will look you
straight in the eyes and if he thinks you
are bluffling wili raise you a "stiff -sum.
One can never read' by his face whether
or not "he has a good hand. But' the
weakness of his, poker game is that he
almcst Invariably overbids his hand.
Poker and monte are his favorite games
and, the Geronimo tepee is the scene of
many highly exciting sittings. Soldiers
an'd cowboys often sit in the games with:
the Indians.
One curioiis trait of the old chief is that
when he makes a big, winning at cards or
has .a large 'sale of trinkets he ". gives the .
proceeds to the little children in camp to
spend for school books." Much of his
money goes to his favorite daughter, Eva,
and his favorite squaw,,, Ketona.. The.
daughter,; of Ketona gets little love from
her father. This is because she married
a white man) and what wa.s still worse in'
the eyes of the fatherâ a cowboy.
. Geronimois said to be SO. : He does not :
know his age. > He was with Victoria when
that' chief tain went against the Mexicans !
later he developed into : a leader him
self. He Is , a ; born â¢ leader of redskins for,
the reason that he is not only a fighting :
man,' >but ; also a medicine : raan, Jand it.,
takes a 1 man 'who 7 can i talk l[ with unseen'
beings to. make a* really deep impression
on- the Indian.
Geronimo is small in stature, possessed
of a keen face and a piercing eye. : The
blue in his eye is of that peculiar steely
color that arouses unpleasant sensations
in the mind. His face is wrinkled and his
hands are small and rough. His color is
a dark red. " Geronimo smokes cisarettes
these days and would drink firewater had
he the privilege. He has six wives, buj
lives witlr none ; of them. His favorite
daughter, Eva, lives with him when she
is at home. He gives her sufficient money
to send her to an Eastern school eight
months in the year.
Geronimo does no work; that is, such as
raising a'' crop, of corn or ; millet.- He gets
rent-free a two-room house to live in,
but he keeps his ponies therein and re
sides in a tepee. All of the Apaches who
are j held as j war prisoners j live I in tents
and keep their horses', in the houses fur
nished to them... The Apache village is on
an open plain, in sight of Fort Sill. In
summer, the , tepees catch all of the dust
and in"' winter the snow flurries into the
doors. It would not be a white man's no
tion of comfort, but the Indians like it.
7 A" few. weeks ago Geronimo's* daughter
Eva was- taken'' ill with some 'skin"dis
ease and was- placed' at the Government
hospital at' the 1 fort.' A Â¦ larsre boll ap
peared; on her i neck., Geronimo told Â¦ the
white, physician in - charge j that It ; should
be opened. : ; The white medicine man told
Geronimo that it should not. .When the
doctor was hot watching the ,' old iwarrlor
pulled out a jackknife and oDened the
sore. The . soldiers placed him in the
guardhouse for three days, but the girl
improved daily, thereafter. Among tho
Apaches Geronlmo is called an excellent
doctor and they will have no other. ;
While little in sympathy with modern
civilization the o!d chief appreciates one
of its inventions, the camera. He charges
$5 for his picture.
He always looks his toughest In his
pictures. He likes to strike an attitude
of devilish ferocity when being photo
graphed. The older he grows the greater
is his desire to r make a fiendish appear
ance. Five years ago. when, he first came
to Fort Sill, he was content to wear white
men's clothes and, consented to have
himself photographed wearing them. Now
when he poses he look:? like the oid-tiras
redskin of the Apache tribe. This is be
cause he sees that -his war clothes at
tract more attention from white visitors.
He does his best to give them their
money's worth and to live up to their ex
pectations. ' â¢
In talking abouthis war experience hÂ»
spoke in the Apache language to this ef
fect: .-Â¦Â¦.."â¢ Â¦â¢Â¦;"
"I do not know how many white men I

- "Would you call Sardou's* playa litera

"And what of 'L'Alslon'?"
"Why not? It is done In books, and
books are the result of some head work.

"The psychologic has a tendency to bor

"Criticism, as I said before, in this
country, at least. Is the voice of the pop

greater authority than the opinion of the
reader or the theater goer. I don't think
that the dramatic criticisms of New' York
papers, for instance, have any influence
at a!!. The newspapers do that work too
quickly, and the articles help neither the
playwright nor the actor. The Influence,
for instance of flippant criticisms is abom

toward actors and actresses."
"Can the critics make a play?"
: "No. The critics cannot make a play.
but they can do worse; they can often kill

that the average occurrence of this crime

of these closing scenes to each tragedy."
"If I remember rightly 'The Modern

Mr. Howells' Method.
We drifted gradually to the more per
sonal phase of creative writing and I
asked the author if a complete construct
ive formula was necessary before the
story should begin on paper.
"I never work that way," he said. "I
couldn't. My method is still a sort of:
psychic puzzle to myself. I usually have
the last word of my book, the last pic
ture, before I begin. I know when and
where I am going to end. Each day's
work seems to be the result of a new mo
tive. Every morning's work on a novel
I am writing completes itself intuitively,
â¢rounds itself out and leaves something
to unfold â to come after for the following
day's writing."
"And how long Is it before you set to
work on paper?" 2&Â£Â£fx
THE rtfalton of the novel to the play
is an intimacy that has become
Etrelned. Both are bleed ties oÂ£ lit
erature, and for many years each
branch of the family was satisfied
â¢with its own domain: the novel for read
ers, the play for theater-goers.
. Only quite recently is the family jar be
tween the novel and the play. It seemed
to me that the matter might be explained
by a competent authority, a literary legis
lator sufficiently prominent in the eyes of
the people to be an authority.
: I went to William Dean Howells. He
discouraged thÂ«s idea at 'first.
"There is no acknowledged authority in
any art in this country, as there seems to
be abroad." lie paid.
"We have critics."
"Lets of them. You know, I think it is
Â» good thine that we have no definite
authority. We can ail criticize here, with
equal rights of address to the community.
It is good to let us find things out for our
selves."

is aglow with ihe warmth of human kin
ship can smile, for I fancy the wlioie se
cret of eeeiniT the world and its little lives
in the light of absolute truth is in keeping
embers called mind and heart from
cooling. The greatest tragedy in human
experience is a life grown <-oId through
Jack of attention to these fires that are
given us to tend within.
; Jin Honest Psychologist.
Mr. Howells I'us been a busy stoker in
this respect, a splendid example in the
refining influences of that realistic psy
chology which few men conscientiously
observe in themselvesâ the psychology of
being honest.
He has never done a false bit of work or
been trapped into saying a false thins,
and there is a supreme confidence In his
convictions in his criticisms on this ac
count.
There was a Puritan simplicity about
his editorial sanctum, and as I looked at
him I remembered being present some
years ago at a public reading given by
celebrated authors and poets at Chlcker
ing Hall, In JCew York, for the purpose of
'raising funds to establish a firm law for
international copyright.
James Russell Lowell was In the chair.
About the middle of the afternoon he
;xnade this announcement, in the quiet,
tranquil fashion that was his own earth
ly atmosphere:
"Ladies and Gentlemenâ Some years
past a young man came to my house with
a bundle of manuscript, which he wished
zne to look at. He Bald, most earnestly, it
â¢was his Intention, hie ajnbition. his deter
mination to enter the field of literature,
.andâ would I read eomi of his work and
advise him? I was so pleased with what
be had given me to read that I gave him
.a letter to a prominent author in active
service, and I fancy it must have encour
aged him."
: Then came one of those electric pausesâ
a silence in the crowded hall that -was al
most oppressive, for. Lowell turned to the
Croup of celebrities seated on the plat
form and said quietly:
â¢ "I have great pleasure in introducing
'that young man to you now, William
Dean Howells."
' Mr. Howells arose from his â¢eat. and as
he stepped forward, one of his books un
der his arm, he grasped Lowell's hand in
friendship as they passed. Many
'seconds, perhaps sixty, went by amid
Â¦ deafening applause and almost hysterical
enthusiasm. Every one there shared for
the moment the hand grasp they had just
and the fruition of the inspiring an
ecdote they had just heard.
' It took Mr. Howells a while* to master'
the emotion of those seconds, in which he
nervously pulled out his handkerchief and
nervously put it back in his pocket, and.
*in the s!ang of the period, "there were
: others." "When at last he spoke his voice
Â¦ was unsteady and his head was bent low
over an open page of the book he was
â¢ holding. He eaid:
"Ladies and gentlemen: The best thing
â¢ I can do is to read to you the selection
i which I am scheduled to read this after
noon while I have any voice left," and he
Â¦ plunged bravely on, mastering suspicious
chokes as best he could.
Yet. as the anecdote reveals, while there
â¢ is much tenderness in the man. there is
a very positive vigor of sentiment that is
j unsparing of work badly done, only half
! thought out. cr built on a basis of emo
tional sentimentality. In morals Mr.
Howells believes the head is a better
guide than the heart, and he applies his
convictions, his human experience to the
art of literature
Novels on ihe Stage.
"Any novel made Into a play is neces
! earily a disappointment to the reader In
the fact that it is an attempt to compress
( action that was originally barely suffi
cient to tell the story," he said.
: "Novels should not be dramatized?"
', *:; *Tm not a dramatist, you' know." he
Bald, smiling reproachfully. "You must
/iot lead me into a positive position or I
shall Jump out through the door."
: *iP u ' yÂ° u wrote ' Yorick's Love.' " i _â¢
"The success of 'Cyrano.' I should like
to feel. Is its sentimentality. You know,
people who bo to the theater are senti
mental. They are moved to enthusiasm
by a little vaudeville 'stunt,' foj instance:
by the vis comica of the comedian, bv tne
stress and terror of tragedy. They forget
the moral in the emotional elements that
are presented, and in things moral the
head is better than the heart."
Cyrano's Success.
"Perhaps I am. Cyrano does a false
thins In marryine Roxano to his cousin
Christian. The latter was qultn inferior
to him and this attitude of apparent solf
sacrifice -was morbid and false. * Roxane
loved Cyrano's mind: she probably never
thought of his nose; it should have been
his duty to prevent her from marrying
Christian."
"How do you explain ita success?"
"Rostand's plays are literary, but he has
a false view of human nature. Of course
he is absolutely sincere in his perception,
but it is a false conception none the less.
In my opinion."
"You are thinking of 'Cyrano de Ber
gerac'?"
"I suppose most plays havo a melodra
matic flavor to them somewhere. Even a
society play may be melodramatic."
"Would you call Rostand's plays melo
drama?"
"I know, a very fixed tradition, to com
bat any suggestion of literature in a play,
and yet It is only plays that have literary
art in them that survive. Look at tne
foreign' dramatists, of whom some of the
best work has come from Spanish writ
ers. like Ecbegaray. for instance." .
"Is the melodrama a truo picture of
life?" ;
"It is almost a tradition of the stage!"
"The literature of a play relics equally
upon what the actor looks as- well as
what he says. 1 know it is the custom to
treat plays as something apart from lit
erature, but it seems absurd, for Instance,
to say when Ibsen writes a play that It la
not literature."
"A sincere dealing with life is always
necessary to successful art in nny form.
I consider lMncro's piays fine UtcnUuro;
he looks things in the face, tells us what
society is doin* and thinking, catches, the
salient points of character and morals In

Thomas is equally sincere and true in h'.s
treatment of American life on tho. aluge,
and 1 could name otheis."
"Are you crlticizins; the actual lines,
the writing of the play?"
"The first principle is sincerity!"
"Well, they are both literature. It la
only very recently that the novol has bo
pun to wear mask and wig. PerhaDs up
to fifty yours apo the play was distinctly
an original story, told in a manner IHted
for representation at the thoHter. It was
a bit of independent literature. Perhaps
the plays of am- literary value produced
now arc only taose developed from an
original source, I consider that 'Unleav
ened Bread' was one. of the best exam
ples of modern dramatic literature. It
had atmosphere and it was a bit of life."
"Oh, yes! I know a llttlo about It.
Heine used to Bay the only way to do it
was to read the novel, then throw-It out
of the window and write a play about it."
"What is the essential difference be
tween the two?"

DISCUSSES THE NOVEL AND THE PLAYhad the captor by the arm and would
not release him. So, "catching a Tartar"
is applicable to one who -has found an an
tagonist too powerful for him.
That far from elegant expression, "to
kick the bucket," is believed to have orig
inated in the time of Queen Elizabeth,
when a shoemaker named Hawkins com
mitted suicide by placing a bucket on a
table In order to raise himself high
enough to reach a rafter above, then
kicking away the bucket on which he
stood. The term coroner is derived from
the word "corphcornor," which means
corpse inspector.
"He's a brick," meaning a good fellow,
â¢jrlginated with a king of SpartaâAgesi
?ausâabout the fourth century B. C. A
visitor at the Lacedaemonian capital was
surprised to find the city without walls
or means of defense, and asked his royal
host what they would do in case of an
invasion by a foreign power. "Do?" re
plied the heroic king. "Why. Sparta has
50,000 soldiers, and each man is a brick."
. When the Horse Guards parade in St.
James Park, London, there is always a
lot of boys on hand to black the boots of
soldiers, or do other menial work. These
boys, from their constant - attendance
about the time of guard mounting, were,
nicknamed "the blackguards," hence the
name "blackguard." Deadhead, as de

TO feel in apple-pie order Is a phrase
which dates back to Puritan
timesâ to a certain Hepzlbah Mer-
tpn. It seems that every Satur
day she was accustomed to bake two or
three dozen apple pies, which were to last
her family through the coming week.
These she placed carefully on her pantry
shelves, labeled for each day of j) the
week, so that Tuesday's pies might not
be confused with Thursday's, nor those
presumably large or Intended for wash
ing and sweeping days eaten when
household labors were lighter. Aunt
Hcpzibah's "apple-pie order" was known
throughout the entire settlement, and
originated the well-known saying.
It was once customary in France whet
a guest^ had outstayed his welcome for
the host to serve a co*ld shoulder of mut
ton instead of a hot roast. This was the
origin oX the phrase, "To give the cold
shoulder."
"Nonel shall wear a feather but he who
has killed a Turk" was an old Hungarian
saying, 'and the number of feathers in
his cap* indicated how many Turks the
man had killed. Hence the origin of the
saying with reference to a feather in
one's cap.
In one of the battles between the Rus
sians and Tartars a private soldier of the

DOWN in Patagonia there Is to-day a
party of men, sent there by a mag
azine, hunting a living specimen of
- the supposed extinct giant sloth.
Scientists, have found footprints pre

and the "West, and from sketches found in
all- parts of the world ' remodeled masto
dons, ichthyosauri, . . megalosauri . and d!l
the rest of them. But living specimens
belonged to a period long on specimens
but short on scientists." That these careful
conjectures of scientists, who have made
this branch of natural history a study,
are correct is more than probable. But if
some real living monster could be found
the discoverer's name would surely be
emblazoned in the anriajs of science.
Â¦ Such, is the mission of Mr. Hesketh
Prichard, now in charge of the expedition
in Patagonia, Eminent authorities in zool
ogy, agree that if there are any of these
specimens living they will be found in. the
mountainous regions â¢ of , Patagonia. Pro
fessor â¢ Roy Loukester, In speaking . before
the * Zoological Society of London, said
that, he -believed it quite possible that\ a
living giant sloth 'might still be found in
Patagonia^
South . America has proved a treasure
ground for paleontologists. ., Many depos
its of fossil remain's have'been Drought to
light there. t It was in Patagonia that De
Moreno, of the La Plata* Museum, made a
wonderful discovery. It - was "at" theren
trance to a great cave that he found a
large skin, and this skin was altogether
unlike any other skin he had ever seen.
Still larger pieces of the skin and many
of the bones were found inside the cave.
After careful study Dr. Moi%no pro
nounced these to be of the giant sloth,
and the skin is now in the Natural His
tory Museum at South Kensinston, Lon
don.
This giant sloth was believed to be al-.
together extinct; just as were ..he mas
todon and. other antediluvian monsters.
The skin found by Dr. Moreno showed
that it had belonged to a living animal
within some fifty year3, at the most. This
fact is one of the most encouraging to the
belief that this monster still lives.
Judging from all that the scientists tell
us this world must have been a queer sort
of a place to live in when animals grew
to three and four story â sizes. . Imasrine
the excitement of the primitive shepherd
watching a couple of megalosauri. or*
giant lizards, grinning at each other with
a grin that spread over some eight feet
of facial countenance and then, with their
tremendous bodies, some thirty feet long,
jump at each other and fight to the death,
tearing . down trees and digging great
holes in the earth during the scrimmage.
Another cheerful specimen of the same
period was the trlceratops. .which used to
amble in and around .the Rocky /Moun
tains. This 'great brute was of enormous
strength and, .according 'to the authori
ties, was about the worst lookinsr bug
aboo of an animal that could be imagined.
FASHIONS AMONG ESKIMO WOMEN
ESKIMO women may not have things
that are considered necessary in
_ other parts of the world, but they
have skillful hands and thoughtful
husbands, fathers and brothers and sons
who provide them with many little things
of use and ornament which are no doubt
as highly valued as they deserve to be.
There is one article which the grand
mothers of children of ' the, present day
considered essential, and which afterward
went out of use and now is coming back
in scmewhat new form\and under a new
name. That is what was the once well
known "housewife." It has been in con
stant and* daily use by Eskimo women
for as long as any of their oldest people
can remember of having - heard about.
This little bag. In which repose the
needles, ; thread and materials used for
sewing and other articles needed' in wom
en's work, is in the Eskimo country made
of the skin of some wild animal, dressed
and sewed into the approved shape and
ornamented with needlework in* elaborate
patterns. In this she carries her thimble
of tough sealskin, needles and bodkins or
ivcry bone, and sometimes, since
white men have come, she has these made
of -Iron or steel. Skeins of thread made
from sinews or tough grass are necessary
to make her .. ."housewife's" equipment
complete, as well as the . usual knives
which take the. place of scissors.
To get her thread she does not' have a
convenient store to go . to, but : she . ordi
narily , makes It . for herself. ' That from
sinews is obtained generally, from the legs
of reindeer. After dryirgr the sinews are
beaten with a maul to cause, the fibers to
separate, after \ which they are divided
and . cleaned. : A comb-like Implement 'is
used in this work of dividing the strands.
If a large thread or cord is wanted several
strands are twisted 'together.*
The Eskimo woman carries her needles
in i reedle cases that might oftentimes". be
the - envy., of her more civilized ; sisters.

skev.er of bone. or ivory from three to six
inches long, about which - the' stout skin
thongs are wound.
The Eskimo woman is fitted out with an
abundance' of workboxes, trinket boxes
and little caskets of small size in which
various odds and ends may be kept. These
boxes are of Infinite variety of shapes and
"designs. Some Â¦ are'" round, some oblong,
some^ square and others are made to rep

Everybody, remembers the complaint
that the people of the South made. Visi
tors would go for the mail on wheels,
drink iced tea on shaded verandas, saun
ter slowly about town with a Japanese
parascl for protection, and all this visit
ing and chatting in their bathing suits.
So is It a wonder that the girls are giv
ing more attention than usual to their
bathing gowns? If this abbreviated yet
comfortrble costume is to be worn so uni
versally, and for so many occasions, one
cannot blame the girls for racking their
brains" and bringing all their ingenuity
and cleverness to the front.
The chief object In life for most women
Is to look pretty, or if they can't do that,
to look as pretty as they can. Some
bright 'girl found out that a dainty suit,
eilk 'kerchief over the rubber cap and
â¢white shoes made a better impression
than afciy old thing that wouldn't be hurt
by 6alty water. /
For half a dozen seasons back pure mo
hair has been used almost exclusively, and
flannel, and silk, the standbys of other
days, have been strangely absent from the
beaches. The newest and by far the most
satisfactory material is a mohair flannel.
It possesses the combined virtues of mo
hair and flannel, and, judging from its
popularity, has come to stay.
Not a few women who have no love for
salty dips and who cordially despise the
rolling breakers, have enthusiastically
bought bathing dresses, along with all the
paraphernalia that nowadays is consid
ered so. necessary for a smart beach toilet.
One of the Â«wellest gowns, and at the
same time one of the newest modes yet
seen, is a white mohair trimmed with
dark blue braid. The braid is put on in six
or seven lines around the bottom of the
skirt and edges, the sleeve puffs and sail-
or collars. A white silk or a blue and
white silk bead handkerchief is jauntily
worn.
A dainty suit is made of purple relieved
with touches of white. The fullness of the
skirt is formed by tiny box pleats that
give it the kilt effect. A broad band of
solid white mohair is held in place by a
zigzag braid. The waist is full and has a
broad white cellar and a braided vest,
which tucks under a white belt. A pale
lavender handkerchief and black silk hose
complete the outfit. The light colors' give
one the idea that it is merely for show,
but it has proved as durable as dainty.
This year there are several new
wrinkles that are of interest to ladies on
land as well as waterites. First and all
important, the bathing suits must fit
with all the elegant precision of a calling
costume. Heretofore there was not much
fit. If one mentioned a 34 or a 36 s5ze, it
was not considered necessary to waste
time to try a suit on. No matter if the
sleeves were a little short or if the shoul
ders were too broad. Who would see" in
the water, and besides, why waste pre
cious time over a rig that was meant en
tirely for exercise?
Swelldom has decided to adopt the
French fashion of carrying down to the
bath houses every morning a pretty white
hand-satchel containing all the forty
eleven small articles that complete a
graceful swimming gown.
The bag in itself is an important ac
quisition as well as a very useful article,
as it holds a silk mackintosh cap, salt
proof; silk hose, white linen bathing:
boots, and a pair of white linen bathing
corsets. These last are absolutely essen
tial this year, as the suits are so cut that
they can't be properly or presenlably
worn without stout, short and very flex
ible stays, that differ from the French
corsets only in the matter of steel, for
those intended for swimming have not a
bit of metal about them.
Although white is very popular, that
does not hinder vivid colors from being

THE LATEST
STYLES IN
BATHING
SUITSBeauvais replied in kind, and it flashed
viciously off. the point of Maurice's saber.
He had only his life to lose, but it had
suddenly become precious to him; Beau
vais had not only his life, but all that
made life worth living. His onslaught was
terrible. Besides, he was fighting against
odds; he wore no steel nrotector. Mau
rice wore his only a moment longer. ' A
cut In the side severed the lacings, and the
sagging of the cuirass greatly handicap
ped itiui. He pressed the spurs and dash-
"The Austrian Embassador has your
history; kill me or not, you are lost."
Maurice made a sweep at his enemy's
head and missed.
"Your life or mine!" snarled Maurice.
His coolness, however, was proportionate
to his rage. For the first time in his life
the lust to kill seized him.
"It shall be yours, d n you!" replied
Beauvais.
Beauvais was now within twenty yards
of Maurice. Had he been less eager and
held his fire up to this point Maurice had
been a dead man. The white horse gained
every moment. A dull fury grew into life
in Maurice's heart. Instead of continuing
the race he brought the Mecklenburg to
bis haunches and wheeled. He made
straight for Beauvais, who was surprised
at this change of tactics. In the rush they
passed each other and the steel hummed
spitefully throv.gh space. Both wheeled
again. . . ***
. Simultaneously with the fifth and last
shot came a sensation somewhat like that
caused by a sound blow in the middle of
the back. Strange, but he felt no pain,
neither was there an accompanying numb
ness. Then he remembered his cuirass,
which was of steel an eighth of an inch
thick. It had saved his life. The needle3
began to leave his right hand and arm,
and he knew that he had receH'ed no in
jury other than a shock. He passed tho
saber back to his right hand. He had no
difficulty in holding it. Gradually his grip
grew strong and steady.
"My Gcd. what a shot!" he murmured.
"I am lost!"

a cowardly cur. xnaurice, by this ma
neuver, gained sufficient time to rid him
self of the cumbersome steel. What he
lost In protection, ho gained in lightness
and freedom. Shortly Beauvais was at
him again. The time for banter had
passed; they fought grimly and silently.
The end for one was death. Beauvais
knew that If his antagonist escaped this
time the life he longed for, the power and
honor it promised, would never be his. On
his side, Maurice was equally determined
to live

and swayed and bit* Sometimes they car

only to come smashing together again. .
The sun was going down, and a clear,
white light prevailed. Afar In the field a
herd was grazing, but no one would call
them to the sheds. Master and mistress
had long since taken flight.
The duel went on. Maurice was growing
tired. By and by he began to rely solely
on the defense. When they were close
Beauvais played for the. point; the min
ute, the space widened he. took to, the
edge. He saw what Maurice feltâ the
weakening, and he indulged in a crue!
smile. They came close: he made, as
though to give the point., Maurice, think
ing to anticipate, reached. ; Quick as light,
Beauvais raised his blade and brought it
down with crushing force, standing' the
Â¦while in the stirrups. The' blow missed
Maurice's head by an inch, but it sank so
deeply in his left shoulder that it splin
tered the collar-bone and stopped within
a hair of the great artery that runs un
derneath. . -
The world turned red, then black. When
it grew, light again, Maurice Â¦ beheld * the
dripping blade swinging aloft again. Sud
denly the black horse snapped at the
white, .which veered. The stroke which
would have split Maurice's skull in twain
fell on the rear of the saddle, . and the
blade was so firmly, emoedded in the
wooden molding that Beauvais could not
withdraw it' at once. Blinded by pain as
ho was, and fainting, yet Maurice saw his
chance. He thrust with Â¦ all his remain-
Ing strength at the brown throat so near
him. And the blade went true. The oth
er's body stiffened, his head flew back, his
eyes started: he clutched wildly at tho
steel, but his hands had not the power
to reach It. A bloody, foam; gushed be

FOR a long time Maurice rode with
his head almost touching the coal
black mane of his gallant Mecklen
burg. Twice he glanced back to see
who followed, but the volume of dust
Â¦which rolled after him obscured ail be
hind. He cou'.d hear the far-off hammer
of hoofs, but this, mingling with the noise
of his own horse, confused him as to the
number of his pursuers. He reasoned that
he was well out of range, for there came'
r.o report of firearms. The road presently
described a semicircle, passing through a
ruftajrer orchard. * Once beyond this he
turned again in the saddle.
"Only one; that is not so bad as It might
be. .It is one to one." But a second glance
told him who this solitary pursuer was.
"The devil!" he laughed â as one of Tas
eo's heroes might have laughed â "The
devil! How that man loves me!" He was
confident that the white horse would
never overtake the black.
On they flew, pursued and pursuer. At
length Maurice bit his lip and frowned.
The white horss was growing larger; the
O:<=tanee between was lessening, slowly
but certainly. ,
"Good boy!" he said encouragingly to
the Mecklenburg. "Good boy!"
Deserted farmhouses swept past; hills
r-ose and vanished, but still the white
horse crept up, up, up. The distance ere
antother half-mile had gone had dimin
ished to 400 yards; from 400 It fell to 300.
The Mecklenburg was doing glorious
work, but the marvelous stride of the an
imal In the rear was matchless. Suddenly
Maurice saw a tuft of the red plume on
his helmet spring out ahead of him and
t>a!I away, and a second later came thei
report. One, he counted; four more to fol
low. Next a stream of fire passed along
his cheek and something warm had
trickled down the side of his neck. Two,
he counted, hf3 face now pale and set. The
third knocked his scaobard Into the air.
Quickly he shifted his saber to the left,
dropped the reins and drew his own re
volver. He understood. He was not to be
taken prisoner. Beauvais intended to kill
Mm offhand. Only the dead keep secrets.
Maurice flung about and fired three con
secutive times. The white horse reared
and the shako of his master fell Into the
dust, but there was no other result. As
Maurice pressed the trigger for the fourth
time the revolver was violently wrenched
from his hand, and a thousand needles
seemed to be quivering in the flesh of his
arm and hand.

"When the British army was at Bloem
fontein preparing for the march to Preto

presence of the most brilliant group of
writers ever brought together by journal
istic requirements and requested them to
make a newspaper for the army. The re
sult was something which deserves to be
called unique. The four editorsâ Kipling,
'"War's Brighter Side," by Julian Ralph,
with contributions from Rudyard Kipling.
A. Conan Doyle and others, is invested
with a unique interest, both by the singu
larly attractive quality ; of the contents,
â¢which include the stories, poems and
sketches of some of the most popular
modern authors, and also by the peculiar
conditions under which these stories were
written.
Now it is to be fair means or foul and
a battle to the death. The account of this
fight on horseback Is a story in itself,
and I have quoted it under a separate
head. It gives an excellent idea of what
a forceful writer Mr. MacGrath is, and
can be taken as a fair sample of the
virile dash so characteristic of his work.

"War's Brighter Side.
By intercepting Carewe's telegrams to
foreign embassies Beauvais has thus far
succeeded in preventing an exposure of
â¢who and what he really is. To let Carewe
escape now would mean the Colonel's
ruin, so he gallops after the flying Amer
icanâthis time to kill.
This is not the last time that the Colo
nel and Carewe are to meet on the field
of battle, and their second appearance in
the lists is even more dramatic than the
first. Matters come to a crisis and the
arm'es of both sides meet on the field
only to ii-il that the .generals of the
King prove false to the puppet crown,
and the battle is over without beginning.
Carewe Is with the forces to fight for
Alexia. He has thrown his diplomatic
career to the w.nds and gone In heart and
goul. When he sees the turn affairs have
taken ho breaks through the ranks that
Tvould hold him prisoner, to fly to Blei
berg and warn the Princess.
The Colonel has such confidence In his
own swordsmanship that he deems it un
necessary to stoop to assassination, but
prefers to take the more gentlemanly
way, though to- him Just as certain, of
giving his victim a rapier with which to
defend himself. Americans as a general
rule are not fencers and on this Beauvais
counts or he would not let the delicate
technicality of a stab in the back stand
between him and his purpose. 'Carewe's
swordsmanship proves a revelation. The
description of this duel is a splendid* bit
of work and its denouement equally sat
isfactory.
Carewe. the American, is the central
figure of the story â a man of the world.
The Duchess Is Justified in the end that
ehe is trying to accomplish but not in the
means that she employs, and so, of course,
the reader's sympathy is with the King
Alexia. An Englishman, Lord Fitz
gerald, plays an important part In the
etory and comes In for a certain amount
of admiration, but by falling in love with
the Duchess he is so easily turned into
her dupe that even the respect of a char
itable reader Is sorely shaken.
In the first chapters the reader is Intro
duced to the affairs "of the kingdom ten
years prior to the actual commencement
of the tale and learns of the political feud
of royalty which is afterward to be sealed
in blood. To go Into the details of the
plot would be to reprint Mr. MacGrath's
book, for the Intricacies which arise can
not be stated In less space than that ac
corded by the author and be fully un
derstood. Suffice it to say that the mottf
is the struggle of a wily Duchess to re
gain from an old King and the Princess
Alexia the crown of her ancestors.
Harold MacGrath has a great success
before him in his recent novel. "The Pup
pet Crown." It may be 6ald that his
Duchess slightly suggests the feline fem
inine villain of Dumas, that his Alexia is
reminiscent of Princess Flavia. that Ca
rewe resembles Rudolph Rassendyl and
that his plot of intricacies in one of the
Fmall governments of the Alps has a
Zenda flavor, but still the treatment is
his own and his romance Is conducive to
the burning of midnight oil. The object
of romantic fiction is to entertain and this
book certainly answers that purpose to
perfection, so why should it not receive
the credit due clever writing?
j The great charm of Mr. MacGrath's
â¢writing lies in his clearness and vivid
ness of Imagination. To him the little
town of Blelberg, near the foot of the
Thalian Alps, is a reality, the puppet
kingdom and its affairs he has by heart,
and he is bo certain of every complication
of plot and counter plot and writes with
so sure a hand that the reader cannot
fail to see with the author's eyes every
change on this comic opera stage. So
real does it become that, whfh the com
edy changes to tragedy, you find yourself
fighting beside the. gallant Carewe and
exchanging sword thrust for thrust in
his uphill fight to save the cause of the
woman he loves.
mATJRICE CAREWE! There la a
character In fiction for you!
We have had D'Artagnan, the
Frenchman; Rudolph Rassendyl,
the Englishman: and now It is Maurice
Carewe, the American. And of the three
I think that we of America will prefer
CareWe: he is more one of us. He Is a
composite of the best in romantic fiction.
He has the lightness and versatility of
the Frenchman and the constancy and
dogged perseverance of the Englishman.

_ Here is a selection taken from the book
showing A. Conan Doyle's "first impres
sions." It is copyrighted by him and pub
lished with the author's permission: .
As the former editors of The Friend have
now formed themselves Into an order to which
none is eligible except he or ehe who tells the
truth without fear of consequences, the reader
may as well prepare himself to meet with
that rare quality In some of the pages that
follow.
To these features I have added many personal
recollections, as well as anecdotes and stories
told by or about the men around me in camp,
and In the conquered capital of the' Free State,
with notes and comments upon a wide variety
of subjects supgested during the editing of the
other matter collated..
Generals, colonels â In fact, men of every rank
and gradeâ contributed their shares; of every
rank down to "Tommy Atkins," who, in gen
eral, sings his songs in the background. In
verse, like the chorus in an ancient drama.
In these letters.' and verses the
reader lives with ttoei-soldlers In camp.: He sees
what they -work and play at. He hears of the-lr
deeds of daring, _ mishaps, -and adventures. : HÂ«
catches their strange lm&o. He observes what
they eatâ Â«.nd what they do not get to drink.
He notes how they speak of their farjng In bat
tle. In all ' the wealth of English literature I
know ot no such a mirror reflection and aÂ»
phonograph echoing of soldier life as Is here.
The etory of Iiord Roberts' experiment and
the experiences of the men he selected for his
editors, must be especially attractive to all
Journalists, and they will find here set forth
whatever lsÂ»of purely professional Interest to
them. To thos<e details I have added the most
notable contributions with which each of the
twenty-seven numbers of The Friend was made
up, and here the narrow limitation of the In
terest in the book is broken wide asunder.
These newspaper articles are mainly the works
of flghtlni? men. at rest between battles, and of
others who were at the moment polng -to or
coming- from engagements. They hold the mir
ror up. to the life of an army In camp, on the
march, in battle, and in a conquered capital.
Lord Roberts Is the first general of whom I
have heard who ever recognized and acknowl
edged the value, and power of the press by
establishing? a newspaper as a source of enter
tainment and Information for an army In the
field, and as a medium for conveying ouch
arguments and appeals as he wished to make
to the enemy. This he did. as one might say,
the instant he conquered the first of the Boer
capitals, almost simultaneously - with his
appointment of a military governor and a pro-'
vost marshal, and the establishment of a police
force. . - . . :-
Mr. Ralph, so well known in the United
States as a newspaper writer and con
tributor to the magazines, has this to say
in the preface to "War's Brighter Side":
On behalf, therefore, of the troops, I would
ask you to convey my best thanks to all who
have contributed toward making the paper
such a success, ' especially to . the r following
gentlemen, Messrs. Landon, Ralph, Gwynne and
Buxton. Believe me to be yours, very truly,

That their labors are appreciated [ is evident
from the eagerness with- which the paper is
purchased 'by officers and soldiers alike.
The army owe. -a debt of ' gratitude to thÂ«
gentlemen who so kindly came, forward, ' and
who have given their services gratuitously in
the" management of the paper.' â¢, *" Â¦
Dear Ixjrd Stanley: I' understand that on
Monday next, the 16th inst.. The Friend will
come under the new.' management, -and it will,
I j hope, continue to j thrive now," that it has
been established on a sound basis.
â¢Ralph, Gwynne and Landonâ selected Mr.
Ralph to act as editor of this book, which
contains the best of the stories and poems
contributed to The vFriend, and also pre
sents a picture of the novel conditions un
der which the paper was prepared. .The
humorous and the exasperating features
of newspaper editing and publication in
the - field are vividly | sketched . by ' Mr. '
Ralph, who ha# improved to, the" full the
delightful opportunities afforded by the
strange experiences of this rare board of
editors. The illustrations include por
traits of the editors In the field and at
work in their improvised sanctum, one of
Kipling's proofs as it was returned to the
Dutch compositor with vigorously uncom
plimentary notes by the author, and many
other full-page pictures. Â¦ A book so rich
on the literary side and so; picturesque
and extraordinary :n tfce circumstances of
its origin comes with* a relish of its own
which will be keenly appreciated. - v
Earl Roberts. wrote the following letter
to Lord Stanley, regarding The Friend: .
' . BLOEMFONTEIN". April .' 13. ' 1900. ;
The American early recognizes hia ad
versary as a scoundrel who had figured
In deeds of bleed in the old South.Ameri
can days, but not until the Colonel has
first spotted Carewe as a man who knows
too mu.'h of- his past. Beauvais induces
the American to come to his room, and
there by the clever display of a photo
graph traps the American into an ad
mission that he knows of the past career
ot the Colonelâ that he know3 too much
to ever allow him to leave the room alive.
It is no easy task that Carewe has be
fore him, but we find ourselves by his
elde with full confidence that, if he does
not succeed in besting the .crafty Colonel
Beauvais and the Duchess, he will at
least make a glorious fightâ and we are
not disappointed. Colonel Beauvais makes
the Ideal villainâ a man with ability, with
a "history," without conscience. He has
everything to fight with and everything
to fight for. He sees the bauble of a
scepter falling from the hand of the old
king, and with Beauvais it is to be all or
nothing. It results in nothing, but the
cost Is dear for Carewe.

the late Colonel George E. Waring, Com
missioner of Street Cleaning. New York.
Although she had lived at Fountain Grove
for years, it was not until Just before his
departure for New York, some nine years
ago. that Harris married her. She is a
woman In the rni-Jdle fifties, and of coursa
a. blind believer in the primate.
Harris waa thus graphically described
by Lawrence Oliphant: "The primate had
two voices â one the distant echo of the
other. The nlsh. voice waa rapid an$ vi
vacious; the off one solemn and impress
ive. His hair was thick, and once black,
was streaked with gray and hung over his
ears to his shoulders. His eyebrows were
beetling and bushy; his eyes were revolv
ing lights in dark caverns, and. like his
voice, had a self-arlju3ting focus. His
cast of countenanAj was Semitic. He wora
a Heavy mustache and a long gray beard.
Sometimes he looked to be only twenty
flve years c!d and at other times over
eighty." - .... ;Â¦;.:.:â¢.;/! -
Although Fountain Grove -vineyard 13
so close to Santa Rosa, few people there
saw Primate Harris, though he dwelt at
their very elbow for twenty-five years.
But strange and varied have been the
rumors that have floated down from this
home of tha mystic3. There have been
stories about Harris burying an obstrep
erous wife for hour3 in soil up to her neck,
tbat the devil might leave her, and this
New Zealand shares with Iceland fhÂ«
distinction over other parts of the earth
In freedom from all forms of cattle dis
ease.
But the old days at Fountain Grove will
never return. With Harris In New Tork
there is no longer the human magnet there
to attract distinguished people from thÂ«
four "corners of the earth.' To-day it is
merely a rich vineyard, with Prince Ka
nal Nagasawa as manager In chief.
Mary Harris rebelled against this with
all the strength of her Independent spirit.
One day she attempted to gain her liberty
by Jumping from a twenty-foot window,
only to be picked up limp and helpless
in the garden and returned to solitary se
clusion. â¢ ' Then fourteen-year-old Mary
Harris swallowed the bitter draught, de
termined'on release at any cost.
For days before this young girl commit
ted suicide she was kept a prisoner In her
own room on the groundless charges that
she was "stubborn and wayward" and
needed disciplining: The testimony, how
ever, proved that sho waa no mor* "stub
born" or "wayward" than any high-spirit
ed young girl fretting for physical and
mental freedom. 8hÂ» was kept In solitary
confinement awaiting orCers to release her
from her grandfather. Primate Harris.
About flvÂ« years ago Santa Rosa wok*
up . on* morning to find that the llttl*
fourteen-year-old girl, Mary Harris, had
committed suicide at Fountain Grove.
They had not even been aware of the ex
istence of this girl and her sister, so
closely, were the children kept when vis
itor* ware around. Not only were theaa
two girls denied a peep at tne Joyous out
side world of childhood, but they were*
even deprived of each other's company,
as the testimony at the Inquest developed.
Â¦ Besides the handsome residences at
Fountain Grove, Harris had a little cabin
ten miles back In the hills, where he spent
the hoars In solitary seclusion and in thÂ»

was to cure her of objecting to his way
of making platonlc love. Again It was
rumored that whenever a person bad an
attack of the "devils" he or she was kept
without sleep as the "lnfernals" werÂ«
more active at night time. One woman,
it Is said, was allowed to sleep only from
9 o'clock at night to 2, the other hours be
ing put In at hard work.
Groups Â¦ of three: or four persons were
formed in the brotherhood, but, if any af
fection developed they, were broken up
immediately. , Thus",: when Oliphant's self-'
sacrifice had' gloriously resulted in routing
the evil one wlthiij him,- he ' sent ; for. his
mother. Lady, Ollphant' came, but Harris
would not allow her to see her. son, -much*'
less speak to him. ";-â¢Â¦'. â¢ . .'
:Â¦ Harris, when. - Oliphant's probation of
two years ,was up, sent him . to London : to :
gave his' entire fortune, $126,000, to Harris
t# Invest along the shores of Lake Erie.
Oliphant then turned his back on his
brilliant career In politics, literature and
society and followed Prophet Harris to
Brocton. His. name among the brother
hood was changed to Woodlive. He rose
at 4 a. "m., spoke to no one, . received . his
food, from a silent messenger, dug out
cow stables, returned at 9 at night to his
loft', over . the stables containing -empty,
boxes and a straw mattress, only to-be
sent out again In the dead of winter tS
draw water for two hours. Thus at Pri
mate Harris' command did Lawrence Oli
phant, traveler, author and politician,
"cast the devil out of himself." .â¢Â¦'-. No't only
did he perform this menial, work, i>ut he
In politics. Harris first tested his com
plete power over' this perverted brilliant
man by accompanying him to the House
of Commons on an occasion when Oil'
phant. expected to electrify everybody.
Harris forbade him to open i his lips at
the critical moment, and Ollphant, whose
pet ambition had been to be a, Parliamen
tary success, was adjudged a failure.
But ' Ollphant, after being recalled from
the .'scene o f -. the : , Franco-Prussian . war,
didn't stay long In America, f. He returned
to < London j and ; with his > mother -.went .; to
Paris. : Here ' he met Alice Le Strange, a
young, ' cultured r- and wealthy . English
woman. They .were .married after great
opposition ' from Harris,; whose permission

called Oliphant frequently to the commu
nity, and, though. Oliphant chafed some
what under this restraint, he remained
loyal.. Before allowing his disciple to un
dertake war. correspondence In 1870, Har
ris rave him a sign by: which he should
know when ' he must return. That sign
Â¦was to be a bullet whizzing into a room
where Ollphant was to be seated. ' During
the Paris ; commune, Oliphant; had' Just
turned into a house to avoid a charge of
soldiery when fa bullet grazed j his hair.
He obeyed the sign and j returned to Har
ris }n. New. York at once," though the Lon
don, newspaper, which he represented, en
tered a vigorous protest.
Â¦ both had craved most humbly.
Two years later Ollphant. his wife and
mother returned to Brocton. His wife
Boon became as thoroughly infatuated
with the brotherhood as he. Lady Oll
phant and Alice were made to wash, Iron,"
mend clothes and raise chickens, while
Oliphant himself was in New York most
of the time attending to the business of
. the community.
. -When Harris pulled up his stakes at
Brockton and came to California to found
. another colony Alice Ollphant was among
those , who accompanied him. ; Ollphant
was ordered to stay East and when ho
.crossed the continent. expressly to see his
wife the prophet said him nay and duti
fully Ollphant returned East. Later hÂ«
went to the Holy Â¦ Land and thence to
London, where his wife was allowed to
join him.
.In I May, 1881/ Lawrence visited hi*
mother. Lady. Ollphant. who waa serious
ly 111 at Brockton, and he started with her
for Fountain Grove. She died in his
arms shortly after arriving there. Harris,
it la said, was very angry that any Â¦ cure
at all should have been sought for Lady
Ollphant This with the discovery that
jewelry Alice had worn when entering the
brotherhood and which : the prlorate had
taken away from- her, adorned a member
of Harris' household, opened his eyes to
the kind of brotherhood he had joined.

that as a Sweden- ,
borgian, with . all
the modern im
provements, Harris
first created a tiny
ripple of excite
ment. He easily be
came the leader of
the band of spirit
ualists who believed
with him. With
these people he de
cided to go to a
'distant place and
found a community.
The "spirit" led.
them to a spot
in North Carolina,
which they named
Mou n t a 1 n Cove
They believed that
this was the origi
nal spot of the Gar
den of Eden.
Harris acted as
messenger between
the Lord and his
own people, and owing to his position aa
the vicegerent of God he received and
held in trust for God all the "property of
the disciples and the community, ; But
after a community life of two years the
disciples disbanded and Harris went to
England in 1853 to lecture and preach. '
There he met Lawrence Oliphant, who,
even^at that age, 30, had had a remark
able career. Oliphant, despite his ad
mitted talent, had every kind of "wheel"
except a balance wheel, and became infat
uated with Harris. It was not until seven
years later, however, that he Joined the
brotherhood. â¢ â¢
Harris had selected Brocton, N. Y., on
the shore of a beautiful lake, as' the spot
for his second colony. He crossed to Eng
land to raise funds for the purpose and
renewed his acquaintance with Oliphant.'
Craftily he held himself aloof -from Oli
pnant after thoroughly arousing his curi
osity. Harris warned Oliphant how hard
it was to get Into the brotherhood on any
terms. This. only spuffed. Oliphant on.
Lawrence Oliphant was then wrapped up
thaX, time Prince Nagasawa has had
charge of Fountain Grove, and under his
supervision the 2000 acres of vineyard
have yielded an immense profit, and the
Fountain Grove wines are more famous
than ever.
But since the departure of Harris the
air pf mystery that shrouded this strange
colony of people has been gradually dis
sipated. Santa Rosa people drive at will
over the beautiful grounds, and a limited
number of Intimate friends are royally
entertained by Prince Nagasawa.
Whether the Prince and the four other
members of Fountain Grove are still blind
devotees of Harris it is impossible to defi
nitely ascertain. But the place Is no long
er the home -and hotbed of the weirdest
communal scheme ever perpetrated. Ac
cording to Prince Nagasawa, Fountain
Grove Is now run on a purely business
basis, the owners living there surrounded
by the comforts and luxuries of any other
â¢weajthy vineyardists.
TrÂ»ere are four handsome houses on the
Fountain Grove property. Prince Naga
eawa occupies the fine mansion used by
Primate Harris when he was leader of the
community. The other three houses are
at the disposal of Miss Nicholas, Miss
Parting, Mr. arid Mrs. Hart and tne vis
iting Harris proselytes.
So' the last leaf in the history of the
much discussed Fountain Grove is turned
down, for without Thomas Lake Harris
the future pages will be but blanks com
pared to the vivid chapters that have at
time's electrified the philosophic world.
For Thomas Lake Harris, spiritual
prophet, eeer. reformer, hypnotist or what
not. Is no ordinary man. He was a human
magnet who drew after him thousands of
converts who were as clay in his hands,
turning over to him all their worldly
goods and obeying his dictates as humbly
as a slave.
It .was not the ignorant and supersti
tious who were caught In the meshes of
Harris* peculiar magnetism. People of
wealth, culture and refinement became his
willing slaves, performing the most de
grading menial tasks that their spirits
might be cleansed sufficiently to enter his
brotherhood.
At a word from him devoted husbands
forswore the companionship of their
Â¦wives. â¢
Mothers parted with children at his dic
tates. Sons and daughters renounced their
parents. . ',v
Aming the most distinguished followers
of Harris were Lady Ollphant, her famous
eon Lawrence and his wife, Alice Oll
phant. Lady Ollphant died In the broth
erhood, but Lawrence Ollphant and bis
wife before their deaths awoke to the
true character of Primate Harris and his
FOUNTAIN GROVE, founded by
Thomas Lake Harris. Is no longer a
colony of n.ystics. By the terms of a
deed just filed Harris and his wife
waive all claim .to this garden spot
of 2000 acres, situated thr-ee miles f rcm
Santa Rosa an-5 famous the world over as
the one-time home of "Primate" Harris
and his followers.
To-day Kanal Nagasawa, a Japanese'
Prince and near relative of the Mikado,
is at the head of the Fountain Grove
vineyard. Prince Nagasawa was one of
the Harris converts who came to Califor
nia with him twenty-five years ago, when
Fountain Grove was purchased by thece
mystics for a nome for the "Brotherhood
of the Divine Spirit."
Nine years ago Primate Harris and his
wife left Fountain Grove and took up
their residence in New York City. Since
teaching. It was when his . talented
cousin. Marg-arct Ollphant, published their
memoirs and branded Harris as a fraud
and impostor that the reputation of
Thomas Lake Harris belted the globe.
Especially in England and America did
the book make a stir.
Yet now this men whose mystic attrac
tive powers played such havoc with so
many lives is surrounded by great wealth
and quietly living in New Tork with his
wife. Jane ,Lee Waring Harris. An"
Fountain Grove, once the focus" for all
eyes inclined mystlcward, is merely an
excellently managed vineyard. The only
element of romance left is that the man
ager is a Japanese Prince and doubtless .
still a believer in Harris and his doctrines.
Harris to his faithful followers has re
cently issued the statement that he has
discovered the secret of perpetual vouth.

The gulch is a mile and a half long and
it takes an ore wafon like' Lawrence
Mills' outfit nearly two hours to get
through. But there is no way around or
over. The little old stream is not * ten
Inches deep anywhere, but the sand is
soft and the rocks are pretty large now
and then to be bumped over. Once in a
while a cloud bursts UP between Bullion
and Old Kentuck. You do not: know any
thing about the cloudburst down in Min-;
eral Gulch, with the slit of sky above as
blue as ever. But in a couple' of hours
there is twenty Â¦ feet of water- boiling
through the gulch from wall to wall, tear
ing ten ton chunks out of the cliff. That
is how the loose bowlders come to be ly
ine around. â¢ V'
When they got well within the shadow
of that canyon conversation languished a
lot. It is not that Lawrence Mills thought
much about It, having been through there,
drunk and sober, till he became reconciled
to plodding along, knowing there was no
way out of It esceptinsr at the end. He
went right aloag telling The Pretty Girl
about two of his wives back East and
how superior she was to both of them and
that he would, never, no, never, flee from
her. But the Girl shivered 'at the som
berness of the place and forgot all about
the local color, ; though . Lawrence . " was
painting pretty, thick. They had cot well
into the gulch, so there was no turning,
before Lawrence noticed ' the ' cows. v > The
air was chilly, though It had been'blazlng
hot; out on tho mesa. . The slanting sun
came a' few feet down on the western
wall, but all the rest: was deep shadow.
On the patch of lighted wall the' Girl
could see the shadow of a buzzard trail
ing along,
"What's that big bird doing there?" the
Girl asked. . ;
"That's a ole buzzard, and he's loafing
around, to .'git his .beak into something
that's good and dead," explained Law
rence, anxious to show his wisdom. Â¦Â¦
The camp -should have sure' dealt this
hand to French Charlie, who is the only
real cultured man In the Territory and
would make no such breaks as that to a
beautiful and innocent maiden.
Just then Lawrence noticed some cows
around the bend of the cliff. There is no
grass growing in that gulch, the same
needing sun. But the cows come down
there to drink and to cool their feet and
to dedge the flies. The' wagon- creaked up
on a bunch of longhorns with calves.
The way the cows ' were hustling their
children out of that canyon was enough to
explain the situation to a tenderfoot.
They 'were pushing them and -butting
them and talking strenuous to them,- as
if they expected death in the family.
VGood Gawd!" muttered- Lawrence,
staring after the cows as they got their
calves headed downk the canyon' on the
jump. Â¦ - Â¦..'/Â¦ ; â¢ â¢

a white chip's show. But don't you worry
none, ma'am.' I'll riue you out of here a
flying."
To the ears of the startled girl there
came a low murmur. Even In the few
seconds she listened the murmur grew to
a'roar. The buzzard sank languidly down
into the shadow around them. The girl
leaped from the wagon Into the water.
"Loose the other mules!" she cried, for
the roar was now beginning to be echoed
by the walls of the gulch. Lawrence paid
no attention .to her appeal. He knew
something about the gait a cloudburst

bounds.. *.?'..: .-;â¢"Â¦â¢"'

"What's a cloudburst?" she demanded
again. \
"It means that in less than ten minutes
there'll be twenty feet of water just a
hootin' through this place!" he said quiet-
Mineral Gulch is a slit in a big rock
bute. It is hardly wide enough for a
wagon to pull along the sandy bed of the
creek. Now and then there are big
chunks of rocks' spraddled around and
sharp turns about jagged corners. The
sides are of smooth rocks that a cat is

when it hits the sands. After trailing
across the sands â¢ fifteen miles it enters
Mineral Gulch Just a sort of dribble.
In spite of all this "The Pretty Girl"
started off with old Lawrence in his ore
wagon. He had put on six mules to make
a pretty trip, and we had chipped in a
couple of dozen jackets to fix a comfort
able nest for the Girl in the body of the
wagon. Some of us boys rode nearly to
Mineral Gulch with them. Had we had
real good sense we should have seen
them through th'e gulch, and the Girl
would have had no such close shave.

the deal herself.
The reception committee that night ar
gued that we ought to hang Lawrence an
hour or two and send French Charlie in
stead, but the Girl would not hear of it.
She said that Lawrence Mills had most
local color. He was a falr-sklnned man
and burned redder that the rest of us.-
He was sure a burning shame to King
ston and as ignorant as a burro.
The very first Sunday, when "The Pret
ty Girl" organized a Sunday-school in the
Dutchman's, Lawrence disgraced us ter
ribly.
"You're a liar!" said French Charlie
promptly. "There ain't no known cir
cumstances when a girl aims to kiss an
ole hold-up what shaves once a month."

"Thank God!" she whispered, taking
Lawrence's big hand In both of her little
ones.
"Blamed if I don't believe she aimed tc*
kiss me," said Lawrence, in relating it
"Oh, don't do that there," Lawrence
said, the excitement dying out of his face
and leaving it full of trouble. "What's
the good of crying; miss, when- wo all
win a plenty?" # â¢
But she still sobbed hysterically. Law
rence sat down beside her and began pat
ting 1 her hand. Her eyes again wandered
to the flood swirling by so dizzily. She
saw the sheetiron roof of a ranch go by.
Then she noticed an ore wagon, turning
over and over. In the brown ruck of the.
flood she caught a glimpse of animals,
the hoofs of a mule, or the head rising,
then boiling out of sight again.
and began to cry.
The towering cliffs had broadened Into
steep hills, up which the mules were
scrambling. Just below them, tho flood
was sweeping by, howling in disappointed
rage. Lawrence untwisted the chains
about X her feet and lifted, her from her
trembling' mule. She sank to the ground
"We wins! We wins!" Lawrence was
shouting in " her ear, while he piled tho
blacksnake with new vigor.
Suddenly the girl opened her eyes. ShÂ«
felt her mule beginning to scramble up.
"Cert," admitted Lawrence, simply. "I
don't get no action on up above, but that
girl wins out wfth her little ole prayer. I
wouldn't have taken the small end of a
thousand to one, while we were chasing
down them rocks with the water a coupla
of jumps behind."
"She said her prayers, I reckon," said
Lawrence, reverently, in telling, about It
to the camp. ;
"Which same shore saved you all," de
clared Old Man Henders.
Above the din of the water she heard
the shouts of Lawrence,, as he lashed at
her mule with his whip. Tnere was no
holding up their mounts In such a mad
race. A single stumble on the .loose shin
gle, a single trip in the sand, and that
roaring wall would have been on them.
They cut around sharp curves, barely
grazing jagged rocks. They leaped over
boulders without pausing to pick their
way. Sometimes Lawrence's whip struck
her, but she did not feel the lash. She had
shut her eyes, and was clinging.
"Don't look back!" yelled Lawrence,
but the girl had seen. Her hat went off.
her hair fell down and she half turned
with a woman's instinct toward disar
ranged back hair.
She saw what seemed to be a dirty gray
dam sweeping swiftly toward them. For
weeks the bed of much of the stream had
been dry. The first rush of the flood had
rolled before it great rocks, logs, bushes
and leaves, pinons torn up by the roots
bristling In front of that swiftly advanc
ing wain Once that reached them, and
they, too, would be twisted* into the mass.
Behind this wall came a flood of turbid
water, angry at being held in leash. The
canyon was full of the din of the water.
It churned and boiled, rumbled and
roared, swirling In a hundred eddies, a
single glimpse of which made the girl reel
dizzily, but she gripped hard the project
ing ends of the hames, braced against the
chains, and she clung on somehow.
As their males jumped away they heard
behind them the boom of great waters as
the cloudburst swished into the gulch, a
couple of hundred yards behind them.
He swiing himself oit the other freÂ«

snake whip and they tore down the bed of
the creek, leaving four frantic mules
plunging and squealing in the harness bo

He grabbed j the chain traces, twisted
them around her feet as she sat astrida
and fastened them deftly to the hames.
"Now you're organized to ride! Don't ba
scared about falling off none."
"Then up you go," said Lawrence, and
he tossed her on one of the free mules.
He gave the hames a shake and a rattle.
"They'll hold," he said curtly. "Never
mind no reins. Grab those hames and
hold on like hell to a sinner. No lady

The girl was now standing In the wagon.
Her face had gone a bit white, but fier
eyes and her -voice were steady.
"Tell me the truth at once," Mr. Mills,"
she demanded.
"Well, it's a cloudburst, ma'am," he
said. Then he ran to the lead mules and

just the comforts of home, so we fixed
up some rooms for her in the First Na

bank since silver fell and busted the
camp. But the First National Bank is
certainly a swell place, with, Mexican

too lucky, and when he Â»came out of the

cloudburst this camp would have voted to
have taken what was so evidently a di
vine hint that Lawrence was wanted in

Tretty Girl" with him. But the way in
Â¦which he brought out "The Pretty Girl"
on his off lead mule has squared him with
Kingston, the loss of four mules and his

the judgment of the camp. They certain

Nothing but Myths
An ex-cavalryman who formerly was
stationed at Fort Sill and who now. lives
here claims to have recognized this Kiowa'
woman as a sauaw, who. with herhusS
band, some years ago caused a sensation
among the whites in the Nation by offer
Â¦â¢â¢*"' -. ' 'Â¦- .
To Mary Harbison the Kiowa woman
has been a little rcore- communicative.
She has said that there is enough gold in
her mine to buy the Indian Territory and
build a wire fence around it. She has
even promised that if Mary marries a
good white man, one who can be trusted,
she will tell him where all this gold is to
be found. ' But he must be a good man,
and "they no heap plenty," so she says.
The facts stated above are substantially
as they are told by Mrs. Harbison. She
has endeavored to learn from the squaw
the situation of her gold mine, but has
been put off with the statement, "You
want more some timeâ me get it."
That gold has oeen used to lift tfie
mortgage on the Harbison ranch and it
has excited a good deal of wonder and
curiosity in this part of the State. The
bank at Dennlson paid out in exchange
for the nuggets the sum of $2000. / -
"Some day me tell you," the squaw
said. "Plenty heap more behind. No say
now. Bad white man he take it."
Neither mother nor daughter had any
idea of the value of the stuff. They knew
only that it was gold and that gold was
cash everywhere.
"Where did you get it?", they asked In
amazement.
"That 'nuff?" she a&ked.
The Indian woman disappeared that
night and was gone six days. On her re
turn she emptied a shot pouch of nuggets
on the kitchen table. Some of them were
as large as peas, but many of them no
larger than the head of a pin. Altogether
there were ten pounds of gold in the heap.
"Wait," she said. "Me get you gold."
The trouble was explained to herâ they
had nothing left, not even a home. She
could not be made to understand what a
mortgage was, but she got the impression
that the great and pressing need was for
money.
"Why you howl like pappoose?" she
asked. "Klowa women no cry when chief
he go 'way."

No Lack of Danger.
Hunting With Elephants.
Elephants, from the nature of the coun
try, cannot be used in the hunting of the
tigers of the delta, so they either will be
stalked on foot or shot from platforms in
the trees or from boats. In hunting the
tigers In other parts of India there will be
sent out, where the nature of the country
will permit, expeditions provided with
trained elephants, from the backs of
which the tiger shooting will be done.
This is the grand and stately way of hunt
ing the jungle monarch, the way of Ra
jahs and Princes. When men go forth to
hunt in this manner the outfit is like a
small army. There are the great lumber
ing elephants, with their mahouts or'driv
ers astride their necks and the howdahs
filled with hunters on their backs. Follow
ing them are supply trains with tents and
camp equipage, that the sahib's rest after
the fatigues of the day may be surround
ed with luxury and comfort. Then there
are hordes of heaters, 'under the direction
of experienced shikaris, who beat the Jun
gle with discordant noises to scare the
tigers tn the direction of the elephants,
and long retinues of servants, gun-bear
ers, etc. Rajahs, xnaharajahs, nawabs and
other native* "heavy swells" take a glit
tering part in such hunts, and the whole
affair, for gorgeousness, -beats a circus
street parade.
Plenty of Chance for Brag ;
This region will be one of the fields of
operation for the sportsmen's army when
It takes the field against the "jungle peo
ple," and a sportsman who cannot come
back from the Soonderbun with enough
trophies of big- game to make him a proud
man for the rest of his life, envied and
the admired of the stay-at-homes, is un
worthy of the name of sportsman. One
week's hunting in the delta of the Ganges
ought to furnish enough material for him
to brag about all the rest of his life, and
many reminiscences of big game shoot
ing with which he can bore" his grand
children in his old age. The Soonderbun
lies not far below the seat of the Indian
Government, the great city of Calcutta,
an excellenf base of operations from
which the expedition would start, and the
waterways of the delta can b^e navigated
by small steamers, so there would be no
difficulty in penetrating into the region
where the big game most abounds. In
deed, a amount of shooting
can be done from steamers and smaller
boats without risking the hardships and
dangers of the Jungle trails.
A part of the forest is reserved by th*
Government for a supply of timber, but
in the Darts not reserved efforts are be
ing made to bring the land under culti
vation. But it is hard to get natives to
work the land, even with the most liberal
Inducements, ffcr the cultivator lives In
constant dread of the army of the Jungle.
Wild boars mangle them out of all recog
nition, crocodiles drag them down into the
depths of the noisome lagoons and tigers
bound into their fields and villages to
seize them and carry them off to the Jun
gle to be devoured, or the buffaloes tram
ple their crops and impale the laborers on
their horns.
S The Soonderbun.
The tiger now Is found In the greatest
numbers In the malarious country that
fringes the Himalayas, In the Jungles of
the central plateau and the dense forest
which clothes the low, swampy lands of
the delta of the Ganges. The man who
first called this delta country the Soon
derbunâbeautiful forestâ must have had
a grim sense of humor, for there is no
more horrible region on earth. The delta
stretches along the northern face of the
Bay of Bengal for 200 miles. Its west
ern half is clothed with forests, while in
the eastern part the shores are mud banks
where the ebbtide retires for twenty
miles from high water mark, although the
rise and fall does not exceed twelve feet.
The Soonderbun region Is covered with a
dense mass of stunted trees growing on
swampy land, which Is fighting continual
ly for existence with the ocean. In
numerable rivers and creeks thread the
matted jungle and miasma-reeks from the
morass. The Soonderbun fairly swams
with tigers, fierce wild boars, buffaloes,
crocodiles and pythons. The tigers swim
the dark waterways, going from place to
place in search of new hunting grounds,
and their yellow heads lit by fiercely glar
ing eyes are seen more frequently than
bosts upon the creeks and rivers which
wind their sluggish course through the
dark and grewsome jungle.

to build platforms in the trees, on which

Is a man-cater, is the neighborhood-' of
some old ruin. He haunts deserted cities
and crumbling palaces â a striped mon

where forgotten kings once held' their
state. Nowhere is the tiger so awe-in

Y"TT NGLAND has another war on
J i hand. This time It Is a war
/ f ' against the army of the Jungle,
* W which Is carrying devastation and
death Into her Indian empire.
? Skirmishes with the 'jungle people" have
groing on for years, but now Eng
land will take the field for a regular cam
ipalgn. So great has become the number
; cf human lives taken each year by the
!wlld beasts and venomous reptiles In In
â¢Â¦dla, and so many cattle are destroyed an
nually by them, that the Government Is
â¢contemplating giving the biggest hunting

imost would Â«ause Nimrod, that "mighty
t .hunter, before the Lord," to leave his rest

r In Epide of the constant hunting of tigers
'and other wild beasts In India the tale
: of men and animals killed each year has
increased, instead of diminished, and has
reached proportions which call loudly for
remedial measures.
An Idea of the state of affairs may be
Imagined from the fact that last year tfie
army of the jungle killed 27,587 people and
over 90,000 head of cattle. Man-eating
tigers killed 899 persons, wolves killed' 338
persons and leopards 327 persons, while
crocodiles and Jackals shared between
them upward of 800. The number killed
by snakes was enormous, no less than
24.C21 persons perishing from the bite of
venomous serpents. In return the people
and the Government of India slew 100,000
dangerous snakes and 20,000 wild beasts.
But these killings of the "jungle people"
are not enough to check their forays
upon the King's subjects and keep down
the loss of life and property, so the Gov
ernment purposes to organize a great
hunt, to which sportsmen from all over
the world will be invited to come at Gov
ernment* expense. Sections of the country
In which the wild beasts most abound
will be'hunted over by thousands of keen
sportsmen and the jangles beaten by
thousands of shikaris.
Nat{ves Must Hunt the Snakes.
The destruction of the poisonous snakes
Is a more difficult matter to deal with.
A snake" hunt does not present the attrac
tions of a tiger hunt and sportsmen hard
ly -would gather from the four corners of
the world to kill snakes. So, while the
army of foreigners which the Govern
ment will have In its service is fighting
the beasts a native army- must be organ
ized to seek out and kill the reptiles,
being incited thereto by generous re
wards. The reason given for the un
usually large number of people killed by
snakes last year is that the floods drove
the reptiles from the streams Into the
fields a;d villages.*where they slaugh
tered man and beast.
"When in 1S77 tigers killed 819 people In
India, it' was thought by the Government
that the limit had been reached, and It
â¢was determined to check their ravages
and decrease their numbers by offering
rewards for every tiger head brought in.
Although 1579 tigers were killed that year
the depredations of the "jungle people"
were not checked, but kept increasing
until they have reached their present
huge proportions. The tiger usually pre
fers as food cattle, deer, wilu hogs and
' pea-fowl, but If he once gets a taste of
human flesh nothing seems so palatable
tc him afterward and he becomes a man
eater. The confirmed man-eater Is an
old tiger, and he seems to kill not only
to gratify his appetite, but from the very
love of killing. A single man-eating tiger
Is known to have killed 108 persons In
three years. Another killed an average
of eighty persons a year, and a third
caused thirteen villages to be abandoned
e.nd 250 square miles of land to be thrown
out of cultivation. A fourth killed 127
persons and caused a public road to be
closed until the opportune arrival of an
English sportsman, who at last killed the
terror of the Jungle.

IN A STUPENDOUS SLAUGHTER OF MAN-KILLERS/fow Many &x-Presidenis of the United Jtaies tfave Spent Jheir Â£ater years
ON January 1, 1S62, there were living
five ex-Presidents of the United
Statesâ Van Buren, Tyler, Fillmore,
Pierce and Buchanan. Now the death of
Benjamin Harrison leaves only one ex-
Preeidentâ Grover Cleveland. General
Harrison spent just eight years as an ex-
President. It
When Jphn Quincy Adams retired from
the Presidency after serving as Senator,-
Minister to' England and Secretary of
State, it was suggested that he become
a member of the House of Representa
tives. He, replied that. to be chosen a se
lectman by the vote of the' people would
be an honor, and for sixteen years, until
the time of his death, he represented his
district in Congress. He died with the
harness on his back, for his fatal illness
attacked him as he arose in the House to
address the Sneaker.
Andrew Johnson was elected a Senator
from Tennessee some time after the end
of his Presidential term, but he lived to
serve only a few days of the special ses
sion of the Senate.
Most of the . Presidents have retired to
lives of comparative idleness. George
Washington led the life of a country gen
tleman on his estate at Mount Vernon.
He gave a certain amount of time to the
reorganization of the army when war
with France threatened, but he contented
himself with the management of his plan-:
tation and the- simple amusements of a
country life.
Martin Van Buren. retired to his country
seat involumbia County,. New York; and
became almost a hermit. There have been
several instances like his. The most re
cent was Chester A. Arthur, who,' like
Van Buren, was disappointed at his fail
ure to achieve a re-election and secluded
himself from all but his intimate friends.
Buchanan was a recluse for seven years
after his return to private life. He had
been much abused toward the close of his
term, and he sought the quiet of absolute
retirement as soon as he returned to his
home in Lancaster, Pa. Â¦ . -
Pierce, lived eighteen years an ex-Presi
dent. His home was in New Hampshire,
but he was a Southern sympathizer* dur
ing the, war and so much out of-sympft
thy with his neighbors that he j spent
many of his later years in" travel abroad.
Â¦ John 'Adams was the first, hermit ex-
President. He was twenty-five years an
ex-President, but he was so disappointed
at his defeat for j re-election that , he se
cluded himself for. a' quarter of a century,
compiling j historic records, and he came
out of his hole only once, when In 1820 he
acted -as delegate to a State convention.
The fact that he retired did riot mean that
he did not take an active interest in pub
lic affairs. Â¦Â¦ ' ' Â¦ ' .
V^n Buren yearned for another term,
but could not present himself to , the peo
ple of his party, because he was opposed
to the annexation of Texas. From his se
clusion he wrote letters which resulted' in

seven years after his term ended.
General Grant was the greatest traveler

around the globe has been described in
two large volumes, and it is" a. matter or

- At the meeting of November IS Mrs.
Preble emphasized the necessity of stone,
brick or cement foundations, advising
concrete for clay soils, â¢which swell when
wet and shrink when dry; also that if
all, to create and encourage a decided
public opinion on these subjects. We de
cided to meet fortnightly to listen to a

the collection of sketches and photo

Mrs. Robinson, with an enthusiasm that
proved catching, "is a problem; and one
that we must set ourselves bravely and
heartily to solve. However pretty a
town house may-be, it becomes an enorm

of economy as well as honesty and beau

The club holds that no colors are so soft,
varied and harmonious as those of wood
colored by weather. To prevent check

be treated with several coats of dull
brown paint; but trimmings have no place
or reason in good house building. They
also hold that houses built of wood should
follow the natural treatment, which is
straight lines, since towers, arches or
round windows are essentially indicative
of stone or brick masonry, and, therefore,
illogical and ugly in wood, and that over
hanging eaves add to the beauty of a
house with their long shadows, and help
to protect it.
On November *16 Mrs. Searby led the
talk on "Building Material." She said
that the stone found on these hillsides
was suitable for building purposes, but
much too expensive for the persons of or
dinary means, putting down its cost at' a
rough estimate as six times that. of, wood.
She pointed 'out the'fact that the fault of

who believes we would be a healthier and
happier people if every builder would feel
convinced that a large roomy, well pro
tected perch was as necessary a part of
the construction as a roof or wall, and a
hundred times more necessary than a.
parlor. There are few days in our Berke
ley climate, the reader contended, when
such a porch could not be utilized by tha
older members, and still fewer when it
would not be a source of health and de
light to the children. The chief point la
that it should be large enough to. be a
real living room, with rugs, easy chairs,
hammocks, a table fon magazines, a few
plants for decoration and a corner for the
children's toys. She believed if we nervous
energetic Californians would build such
porches the temptation to utilize them
would be so great that .we would give
over some of the useless and meaningless
fret and worry of our too often dull and
prosaic HVtes.

knewn as the half-timbered or Tudor
style. From this it was transferred to
the' so-called "Colonial." Shingles, how
ever, do not blend with the classic purity
of the true Colonial and can only be used
to advantage in the modified Colonial,

the color and jrraln of wood with paint.
Her conclusion was that the Swiss chalet
suggested the best ideas for scenic park
architecture.
The principles of "The Hillside Club"
Mrs. Robinson succinctly stated to be as
follows: That hillside streets be made

THE SUNDAY CALL.
ARTISTIC HOMES IN
BERKELEY/^\ NE of the oddest spectacles in the.
(( j] transportation business Is the sig&t
\s^ of an electric cor running two miles
or more a minute on a one-rail
track. Even If It appeared feasible, oa a
casual examination one would say that It
was about the most dangerous form of
traveling that could be devised. But the
truth Is the exact reverse, judging by the
records of the three mono-railroads which
are In existence. There is one In Ireland,
another In France and a third In Bel
glum, and It la proposed now to build
one In England to run between Manches
ter and Liverpool, thirty-four and a half
miles, which distance. It Is said by. the
projectors of the scheme, can be covered
in eighteen minutes.
The line In Ireland, from Llstowell to
Bally bunr.ion, ten miles, has been run
ning thirteen, years, and the company
proudly polnt9 to the fact that in that
time there has not been a single accident
on the road. The cars and the engine are
suspended from a single steel rail, which
rises about three feet from tho ground.
The center of gravity of the cars is be
low the rail, which takes away the pos
sibility of the trains leaving the track.
An odd arrangement of the "points," as
railroad switches are called In Great Brit
ain, Is seen nt the terminals of the line,
where a section of the rail turns on a
piv*ot, connecting with any one of several
tracks.
Tlie use of electric rower permits the
employment. of a novel kind of blook. In

It is something for our citr to be proud
of to know that this unselfish work for
the sake of music itself is being done and
that we have . on the extreme
edge of our continent a club of male
voices which by competent critics is said
to be fully as good as any one of the best
similar organizations In New York, Bos
ton or Philadelphia. ~ ! :*r
- Already the committees are contemplat
ing having an exceptionally important
series of concerts during the. twenty-fifth
season, their seml-Jubllee, but in the
meantime tho rehearsals are being held
for the last concert of the twenty-fourth
season, to be held within a short time. .
The membership of the organization Is
strictly on an amateur basis; that is, each
Ective member works for the club as an
amateur, and no matter how prominent a
part he may take in a concert it is as an
amateur member of the club.
For an organization of this kind to have
been In existence twenty-four years and
to.be as strong and healthy now as ever
It was proves conclusively that the policy
of the club, which has been to keep
strictly to its established high standard, Is
good business policy. In reply to an in
quiry as to when the business of the club
is transacted it Is explained' that once a
month a business meeting is held after
the rehearsal, but as the club at the be
ginning of each season places control of
the arrangements for the season In the
hands of several committees thcsÂ« busi
ness meetings are principally to hear the
reports of the committees and the treas
ury. The Income of the club Is derived
from the active members and also from
a limited number of associate members,'
who, by their associate membership, are
entitled to tickets for each concert In the
event of there being any extra expense,
say for a. small orchestra, the active mem
bers In such a case do not hesitate to as
sess themselves. V A11 this is done to main
tain that high artistic standard, to which
the club In the beginning determined to
adhere.
The last two pieces studied that even-
Ing were two of Dudley Buck's, one be
ing a setting- of Tennyson's "The Bugle
Song" . and the other "The Chorus of
Spirits and Hours," from Shelley's "Pro
metheus Unbound," two very different
compositions, yet two which are certain
to make a ureat effect at the concert
when they are sung.. The printed copies
of these state that the accompaniments
are for piano, organ, string quintet and
flute, and : the writer was Informed that
the fuir accomDanlments will be used at
the concert, which doubtless will enhance
the- efl>cf considerably; but even with
the piano alone and at this early stage of
the work it Is evident that they are fine
compositions and are sung by the club
con amore. Then the director announces
that this Is 'all for the evening, and In
stantly discipline is again relaxed and the
air of hearty good-fellowship is evident.
use it is 'surprising that there are not
more errors of this kind), but to this the
director seemed to pay little heed, simply
remarking, "No solos, gentlemen," for, as
he afterward explained,- when any one In
dividual has suns a "solo" of this kind
once he. very rarely does It again, so that
there is ' practically no correction neces
sarr. â¢
At this stage of the rehearsal tho sec
retary called the roll and the members
had a ten minutes' rest, when they moved
around and had a chat with any one
whom ithey wished to see who might not
have happened to be ; sitting* near them,'
while, the air of good-fellowship which'
seemed to pervade - the whole; club sug
gested how healthy the. organization is.
In these few minutes one could see that
the director placed himself on an equal
basis with the. others as one, of .the mem
bers, but .whenever he again rapped on his
desk for attention each man resumed his
original seat, and there was absolute at
tention and discipline. '. . ;
"The Dreamy Lake". of Schumann Is, a
very delicate composition,., which must
necessarily be, sung' with great care. In
this occasionally a single, voice could be
heard singing through -a rest or coming
in at the, wrong time (and considering- that :
in a majority of these pieces single-voice
part3 of the music are' what the chorus
Next there is taken up a dashing setting
of the "Eedouin Love Song", by Arthur
Foote, a Boston composer, who, even If he
had never written anything else, has cer
tainly by this one composition established
his claim to be a clever musician of the
front rank. Even at this early rehearsal
the singing of 'his number by the club is
most exhilarating. It goes with an aban
don and dash which is rarely heard. In a
chorus, but this does not satisfy the di
rector. A few measures on the last page
are not sufficiently emphasized; there is
not a large euovgh crescendo on one long
sustained chord, â¢ and particularly he In
sists that the very last chord of the piece
ehall.be sustained" fortissimo to tho end
and then . that every voice shall stop as
one.; "Patience, gentlemen," quietly re
marks the conductor. "It is worth"^ the
trouble." After this Is tried two or three
times It Is marvelous how great, an Im
provement becomes noticeable in the cli
max of the song.
Following this the first basses are drilled
very carefully in Johannes Pache's
"â¢Moonrise," in which these voices have
quite a prominent part, the director with
just the suggestion of a twinkle In his
eye reminding them that it is not neces
sary to extemporize or to compose as they
go along, as probably what the composer
wrote was written for some purpose! This
was apropos of one slight break where
two or three voices sang a G sharp In
stead of a G natural,' which .was immedi
ately corrected.
But the baton again signals for the club
to sing together, a stop being made to ex
plain that the crescendos are much too
abrupt and the decrescendos' not smooth
enough. The serenade is immediately fol
lowed by the "fihine Wine Song" of Men
delssohn, which, at the third singing, is
taken with a dash which is electrifying,

of , the piece and- a caution from the di
rector that the dotted eighth and six
teenth notes must be most carefully

understood to mean 'very soft,'" where
upon there is a long-drawn "Oh I" from
the chorus, suggesting that the same in
quiry and same reply have been heard
before. , . , " '.-.'' '. .
Then the two librarians give further
practical evidence of .how well they un
derstand their duties. One gathers up
from the men sitting on the seats next
out that on such and such a page the ral
lentando was not unanimous. Iiamediate
ly the pianist patterns the phrase, and
these few measures which were 'not satis
factory to the director are gonenover per
haps half a dozen times until the ciub
answers his baton with confidence and de
cision. Then again he points out that the
three lower parts are singing too loudly,
and with a little plaintive humor he sug--,
gests that perhaps it >is Just as' well that
the first tenors also should be heard! The
piece is then sung through again, but this
time wherever there is a weak spot a stop
is made, and whichever part is at fault
Is told of It, and that part alone perfects
the few measures that are shaky. At the
conclusion the director with a gmlle says':
"Generally good, generally good, but too
strong in parts, and, gentlemen, please
accent the bell effect in the middle sec
tion." This also 13 now Improved until
the effect produced satisfies the conductor.
During a pause there is a voice from the
second bass, "Mr. Lorlng, I notice In my
copy quitf! frequently the sign 'p. p. 1 May
I ask what It means? I notice that most
of the men sing this more loudly than the
other parts not' so marked." "Oh!" re
plies the director, "I perhaps should have
explained that the two letters do not slg-
the center aisle ttie copies from their re
spective rows (by the by, the seating is
arranged in four rows with a division up
the middle so' that there a,re r^illy two
choirs), .while the other librarian distrib
utes copies of thenext piece for rehearsal.
This happens to be a tender little sere
nade by Eisenhofer. It has evidently
, been sung before, and the. director must
there is some weakness, for he takes
\the parts separately;. second tenors alone,
first bass alone, first tenors' alone, second
bass alone, and then he takes, them to
gether; and here one cannot fall' to ob
serve tha,t np matter 'whether there Is
being rehearsed a single, part or the en
tire choir, the' conductor Insists that.all
the nuances in the composition ' under
study shall be observed. â¢
After it is finished the director points
TIME! time! gentlemen." With a
laugh the word is repeated in the
hall and corridor, and immediately
about fifty or sixty men take their
seats without any confusion or bua
tle while exchanging a flre of good-na
tured banter, two or three email groups
finishing off their conversations which
had been going on prior to this stentorian
interruption originating from a gentleman
seated in the center of the places allotted
to the barytones of the chorus.
ItÂ» is a very pleasant couple of hours, a
rehearsal of the Lorlng, Club, at least"
from a spectator's point ofj view, and, al
though there is a great deal of hard work
accomplished by the director and the gen
tlemen of the chorus within that time, yet
it is fully evident that whatever labor
there is. Is a "labor of love."
For four and twenty yeara the Lorlng
Club of San Francisco has been one of the
most popular and yet at the same time
most uncompromisingly artistic of the
musical organizations of the Pacific Coast.
The club regularly gives four concerts in
each season, these concerts belns con
ceded to place the club In the front rank
of musical associations, and easily one of
the six best male voice societies in the
United States. The tickets for the con
certs ' are always in great demand, al
thoush they can be had only through tho
courteey of the active and associate mem
bers at the club, and the audiences are
of the most cultured and fashionable of
our city. It must have occurred to almost
any listener at the club's public -perform'
ancos that such excellent concerted work
must necessarily mean a great deal of
preparation, and it was with the view of
seeing "how It Is done" that the writer,
attended a recent rehearsal. '
It has Just been mentioned that, there
was no delay or confusion In the member*
finding their places prior to the beginning
of the rehearsal and this, though appar
ently a small matter, is very BUggestive
of wuat assures the continued artistic
success of the club, for everything is well
managed and nothing is taken for grant
ed. Each member has his own place, the
chorus being seated at a concert in exact
ly the Mine order as at every rehearsal,
and any one who has had -experience ot
choral music appreciates how well calcu
lated this is to give confidence when It
comes to performing in public.
But now the director has taken his place
on a platform slightly raised above the
accompanist and chorusâ the accompani
ment at th<* rehearsal Is that of piano.
The two club librarians have distributed
copies of the first number to be rehearsed; t
and while this was being done an onlook
er could not fail to be struck with the
expeditious and skillful way -in which
these two gentlemen supplied each mem
ber with a copy, all the time being sub
jected to a running. fire of chaff, which
evidently they were able to return In sev
eral instances with Interest Â¦ â¢
This first number Is Schubert's dainty
"The Gondoliers." The conductor lifts his
baton and immediately there is absolute
quiet, the pianist playing the opening sym

sion were a concert. The' piece is read
through, and very excellently read, too.

Â«very member of the church. In the of
fices of the apostles they may lay what
ever plans they will, and depend upon the'
Mormon people to carry them out
And there Is good reason behind this
pressure. The secor.d generation in the
church have lost much of the spiritual
longing that led their parents across was
and continents to join the New York
prophet and his successor. They have
been touched by the spirit of*Amencah

recognized that they are In such position
that It would be far more profitable to
place themselves in touch with American
life and gain concessions by conciliation
than to^stand as outcasts In tho country
which is meeting with such commercial
prosperity.
Signs of this abandonment of the prin
ciple have been multiplying in Utah as
the authority of the older men has waned.
Most significant of these are the facts that
within two years the strongest rule of
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young has
been broken, and Orrin W. Woodruff was
r.omed as a member of the sacred twelve
apostles before he had been marrUd even
once, while Heber M. Wells. Governor of
Utah,, himself born In polygamy, and a
von of one of the strongest champions of
the system, has refund to sign a bill to
prevent the prosecution of polygamlsts
In the S*tate.
Xot the least of the changes expected
Is the abandonment of polygamy .as an
active tenet of the religion. Plural mar
riage never has been popular among the*
2f crznons. Even In the days when Brig
ham Younj, with autocratic power over
the affairs- and even the lives of his fol
lowers, enforced the practice by command
end revelation, scarcely 5 per cent of the
people could be induced to sanction the
doctrine. .
Men who Bought place In the church,
ether* who In fanatical zeal wished to
totiJfy by sacrifice to their belief in the
revelations of their prophet, and still oth
ers who feared, the authority of the
church oSldols, took plural wives, but the
great body of educated and influential
members refused.
In the second generation the spirit of
opposition to the practice has been shewn
more strongly. With free education in the
centers of population and constant contact
with p*"' . cf the world has come a de
termination to live In accord with the so
cial doctrines of the country. And what
Is most significant is that the most de
termined foes of the continuance of plural
marriage are those born within it, ar
rayed against It because of the strong
feeling of their mothers.
Liberal elements in the Mormon church
have long whispered that the passing of
the first generation of the men who were
closely In touch wth Joseph Smith and
Brigbam Young in the organization and
reorganization of the church and in its
days of emigration and trouble would
mark a revolution In the conduct of the
Mormon people. And with George Q.
Cannon passed the power of the first gen
eration.
Mormonlsm of the past, with its defiant
championship of polygamy, has presented
a social problem that has taxed the in
genuity of our national statesmen. Mor

of c right of ecclesiastics to share in the

\.\\ff we don't really mean an Ameri-

and who prefers nuts and roots to pate

Just so when we 6peak of an Australian
we do not mean a bushman. We mean
the white stranger within the Australian
gates, the man who has claimed another's
Inheritance. Upon the same principle, a
â¢"New Zealander" is white, while the na

cerned. In the colloquialism of the "Aus
tralian," he is always a "black fellow."
The aboriginals, then, or "black fellows"
ef Australia represent one of the lowest
types of the Inferior human races. They
are of unprepossessing appearance, their
bodies being very thin; their legs straight
and almost without calves. â¢ This general
leanness is probably due to their food,
which is chiefly animal, the principal
Items of their diet being marsupials,
echidnas, birds, snakes, lizards, crayfish,
Bhellflsh and eggs of birds or reptiles.
Nothing is more delicious to an abori
ginal epicure than a fine kangaroo steak
for breakfast. It is the favorite grille^ of
the bush. Kangaroo flesh is a trifle coarse,
according to the white men's verdict. That
may be because their chefs have less art
with kangaroos than the black chefs of
the Interior.
Borne of the wilder tribes regard human
flesh, and particularly that of a fat China
man, fit very good eating. The men pro
cure the animal food, and the women dig
tor edible roots and search for mush
rooms, grass seeds, honey, sweet resin and
the manna of gum trees. It Is sometimes
made unpleasant for them if they are
slow In their hunts. Mushrooms are often
scarce, honey is almost impossible to find
in some districts. So upon such occasions
a wife serves the choicest possible roast
of lizard to begin with and then apolegetl
cally explains that there Is no dessert.
The eequel depends upon what kind of
man the husband is. The chances are
that he Is primitive in his Ideas of domes
tic discipline.
The Australian continent is very poor
In edible frrlts, and the aboriginals " are
quite Ignorant of the culture of bananas,
taro or yams, which afford excellent nuor
lshment to the various Polynesian races.
"Wherever the aboriginals come much In
to contact with white men, and are able
to procure sugar and flour, they are less
lean, and some of 4hem become even fat.
One roly-poly old fellow often waddles
down to the western mines and asks for
sugar.
"Su-gar," he can say, very distinctly if
he takes his own time.
"He'd live on nothing but Bugar if he
could get enough of it." one of the miners
eaid. "Look at the way he eats it. Scoops
It up In his hand and licks it up like a
horse. He'd trade anything he has in the
world for sugar. The other day he came
for it and I told him I had only a little
left, no more than I needed myself. He
offered epears and matting" for it, bidding
higher at every refusal. Finally he went
away and I thought he had given up. But
within an hour he was back with his wife.
Bhe was frowning and sulky and I didn't
know what ailed her until he offered her
In payment for a pound of sugar."

THE PROFESSIONAL
BEST MAN IS
VERY USEFUL.
If there is a reception he has to see that
his newly married friend does the proper
things, at the prgoer times, and that he
behave*' like a rational being. The bast
man is usually charged with the railway
tickets for the first stage of the bridal
Journey; It is his 'duty to set the happy
pair aboard of the right train and to at
tend to the checking of their razzac*.
He -must bring him to the church in a
calm and collected state of mind and an
unruffled and immaculate costume. And
from that time until he hands him into
the carriage beside the bride he must
watch him as a faithful second watches a
prize-fighter in the ring. An7 sign of
weakness, any symptom, such aa a
itwftchlng knee or a wavering eye, must
be noted at once and remedied with dig*
patch and determination.
The responsibilities of the best man do
not end with the actual ceremony.
The ( best man must be certain that th*
groom has properly attended to the feÂ«ihg
of the clergyman. At thft ushers' dinner
he Is the master of ceremoniesâ this of
itself is no small undertaking. He must
se that the brMegroonu^durlnsr the hours
Immediately preceding the ceremony, I*
unvexed and , untroubled by disturbing
cares, and that h!s toilet for the great
event in performed with precision and
composure.
In the first place, he must see to it that
the bridegroom. is well up in what may
not irreverently be called the stage busi
ness of the ceremony. He is like tha
prompter in the wings; If he fails at tha
critical time the whole performance may
be rulned.VHe must know the exact tlmiÂ»s
for kneeling and rising and turning, ha
should be able to repeat the marriage ser
vice backward, and. indeed, it is recorded
that in the course of a certain large and
very swell wedding m Boston the beat
man, close at the bridegroom's back, ac
tually himself declaimed the responses
which htj/ principal should have made,
that gentleman being so overcome as to
be temporarily bereft of speech.
For If you think that all a. best man
has to do is to stand beside the groom
and tell him to keep his shoulders back
and straighten his necktie you ax* very
much mistaken, j
Now it by no means follows that th*
best man is also the bridegroom's beit
friend. His best friend may not have tha
Qualities which go to the making of a
best man. He may be, excitable and an
easy victim of "the rattles." Ha may bÂ«
of the careless kind, that cheerfully
shirks responsibility. However coed a
friend he may be. it Is possible that he
may also be a broken reed at the crisis
in the chancel and during the delicate ar
rangements before and after.
In every sense the best man sees the
bridegroom through when the latter, be
ing distracted by Joy or otherwise, can't
see himself through anything whatever.
The bridegroom needs moral support. .as
well as practical assistance in finding the
ring and catching the train. He wants a
man to lean on. He wants somebody to
"see him through," and it is no empty
phrase that such a personage is, denomin
ated the "best man."
"When a prospective bridegroom looks
among his unmarried friends for a "best
man." the usual formula with which his
request is made Is an appeal *to "see me
through." I dare say that those are tha
exact words in four cases out of flvei and
they express exactly the nature of the
service which la asked- for.'
Between the bridegroom and his best
man is often a more genuine bond of feel
ing than theVe is between the bride and
her chief attendant. It Is popularly sup
rosed to consist principally of sympathy,
but this isn't altogether a correct hypoth
esis.
He -will say that when he sees a tearful
little bride his only feeling Is a charitable
hope that she won't cry herself into a red
nose for the reception. It is nevertheless
true that th* masculine heart usually
rives a further quiver at "The Voice
That Breathed O'er Eden." and that a
lump has been known to come Into tho
masculine throat at the happy confidence
of the bride's "I will."
Tou see. such things mean a lot, after
all. to the most worldly of us.
But in epite of this appearance ot
thlncs, men are not untouched by senti
Â»pmt at such times. It goes without say
ing that they won't admit it. The most
hardened and experienced usher will tell
you that he hears the "Wedding: March"
with less emotion than is provoked by
"Johnny, Fill Up the Bowl."
The men In a marriage ceremony look
like a lot of busy, work-a-day beetle*
hovering about a bunch of interesting ap
ple blossoms.
As for the groom, he ts aa Indispensable
adjunct, but there Is nothing plctureeque
about him. He represents the worldly,
matter-of-fact element as opposed to tnÂ»
feminine and romantic side ot the busi
ness. \
PEOPLE are accustomed to thin*
that tha sentimental side of & wed
ding Is exclusively the eoneem of
the women interested In It. The
romance and poetry of the occasion are)
represented by the fluttering Ptek and
white bridesmaid*. thÂ» stately maid eÂ«
honor and the radiant bride herself, while
the black coated ushers and ttÂ» best man
are merely supernumeraries who attend tÂ»
such prosaic details as fradraar seats for
the spectators and providing * back
ground for the- bridal picture.

TRIBESÂ«=if=HE most wonderful and by far the.
largest bird that ever existed ia the
11 moa of New Zealand. It belongs to
the same order as the ostrich, the
cassowary and perhaps the dodo. Moa
seems to be a generic name for a large
bird among Polynesians. The moa at one
time existed in very great numbers in the
north and middle islands of New Zea
land, Its favorite haunts being the ex
tensive, well-graHsed plains of Canterbury
and Otago, In the interior of which latter
province immense quantities of its bonea
have been discovered.,
In 1S29 a part of the thighbone of a moa
was brought to England, and from that
fragment Professor Richard Owen, the
great naturalist, reconstructed the whole
bird: The conclusions reached were so
surprising that Professor Owen's friends
tried to suppress his paper on tha bird,
believing that lt would seriously damage
his reputation as a man of science. But
fossil remains of moas afterward sent to
England by settlers in New Zealand made
lt certain that as many as fourteen va
rieties of wingless birds had at ona time
existed in New Zealand.
Of the bones found in the colony at va
rious times the largest belong to a bird .
to which naturalists have given the name
Dinornls. Maximus. The museums of New
Zealand contain many fine skeletons of
the dinornls. The one shown in the-pho

THOSE who say that the days of mir
acles are over should go to India,
says a retired officer of the British
army, when, if they are lucky enough to
meet a faker of the hills, they will not
only have reason to modify their opinion
but I c?.n guarantee that they will see
things which. will make them doubt even
the evidence of their own eyee.
But I will describe one of the things I
myeelf witnessed some twenty years ago,
and which 'you will confess is the most
amazing experience of which you have
ever heard. I do not profess to account
for it ln x any way; I. only describe it ex
actly as I and my* companions, any one
of whom will corroborate me to the small
est detail,' saw it.
It was a shooting expedition In
1880, whenV and three brother officers had
spent a long, tiring day tracking a man
eating tiger among tho hills of the cen>
tral provinces, about two days' journey
from Leoni. We were smoking our cigars
outside our tent preparatory to turning in
for the night, for we were all dead-beat,
when we saw two dusky figures approach
ing us, salaaming lower and lower as they
came nearer to us.
One of them, was a dirty, unkempt,
gray-headed man, clad In a turban and
loin cloth, who was unmistakably one of
tho fakers who haunt these hills and way
lay tourists and sportsmen with a view to
backsheesh; and the other was a small,
equally dirty and slightly clothed boy of
about 12 years of age.
As- we knew their business we affected
to ignore them and awaited developments,
which soon came. While thÂ© boy flung
himself on the ground the faker put down
a bag he wa3 carrying and took from it
a small ball of twine, such as. grocers
use. Takinsr the free end of the twine
between hte fingers, he tossed the ball up

and by Its sida,' for purposes of compari
son, is placed a skeleton of a native
Maori, or native of New Zealand. On the
left of the photograph ig shown the dinor
nis as restored by Ho'chstetter, and by
the side of the gigantic bird Is shown the
little kiwi, "which belongs to the same re
markable family cf wingless birds and
which is still found in large numbers in
certain parts of the New Zealand bifth.
. The largest member of the moa familyâ
the dlnornisâ was from twelve to fifteen
feet high, so that if it had wings it might
easily have carried a man up into the air;
but it did not possess the power of flight.
It had legs as long and strong as those
of a camel, the bones measuring more
than a yard in length and a foot around.
In fact, they were supposed at first to be"
those of some very, large quadruped. It
would naturally be supposed. that the gait
of so huge a bird would have been very
rapid, but the dinorpis is said to have
been sluggish In its movements, though it
could kick with terrific force.
Its feet and toes. were very strong and
well adapted to uproot ferns, its principal
article of food. It swallowed pebbles to
aid its digestion and laid greenish-white
eggs to perpetuate its Epecies. A nearly
perfect egg has been found; it is nine
inches in diameter, twenty-seven inches in
circumference and a foot long. Iti con

in the air. Higher and higher it mounted
until the eye could follow lt no farther,
as it vanished seemingly into thin air.
ThÂ© faker then released the free end and,
to our amazement, tho string remained
vertically suspended in thÂ© air as far as
the eye could follow it.
The old man then began to tug violently
at thÂ© string as if to recover thÂ© vanished
ball, -but it refused to yield an inch; and
in affected rage he spoka a few words to
thÂ© boy, who rose from thÂ© ground and,
seizing thÂ© twine with both hands, began,
to climb up it.
Up and up he climbed, growing grad
ually smaller and smaller until he was a
scarcely discernible speck, apparently
hundreds of feet from the ground. Then
he, too, vanished as completely as thÂ©
ball had done. After a few momenta*
waiting for the boy's return thÂ© faker
called loudly to him to come down, be
coming frantic with rage at his refusal
to obey. Then taking a huge curved knifa
'from his bag he gripped it between his
teeth and with murderous intent began to
climb up the string after the vanished boy.
Higher and higher be went until he in
turn was lost to siijht and we gazed at
each other and the thin line of string,
the only material thing left to our vision,
with dumb amazement.
. Then a distant shrl-ik of pain and horror
broke on our ears with startling effect and
a round, black thins came rushing down
through the air and fell at our feet. "We
looked at it In stupefaction; it was the
head of the boy severed from the body,
with quivering muscles and flowing blood,
to prove that it was^no figment of thÂ©
fancy.
A moment later one ssvered and bleed
ins arm fell from the sky, and then an
other; and these were followed by two
legs as neatly dismembered as if cut off
by the knife of a skillful surgeon. And
then, while we were gazinjr with horror
at this grisly spectacle the faker himself
reappeared climbing down the string and
holding the knife between his teeth.
Calmly collecting the head and Iimb3
he placed them in his bag, threw it over
bis shoulder and began to walk away. He
had not gone many paces before we saw a
movement In the ba#. The faker placed it
on the ground, and, to our astonishment.
we saw the boy emerge from it, smiling,,
and as sound in body as ever.
I A mcinent later the two were walking
back toward us, salaaming at every step;
and I need not say that they were well
rewarded for their entertainment.
How do I account for it? Well, as I
have said, I don't profess to understand
it at all. and only describe what we saw.
Some say we were all hj'pnotlzed and saw
just what the faker wished us to see. All
I know is that it was the most astounding
and mysterious thing I have ever seenâ
and I've seen some strange sights.
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR WONDERFUL
TRICKS DONE BY THIS INDIAN FAKER.
BIGGEST GRASSHOPPER HUNT EVER HEARD OF
IS TO TAKE PLACE IN NEBRASKA.
5N Nebraska thÂ© farmers and scientists
arÂ© organizing- a grand grasshopper
hunt. It will be the first time that
anything of the kind on so large a
scale has been attempted. It Is not in
tended that on stated days the neighbors
shall meet, encircle a given territory, and,
drivine the grasshoppers before them Into
a constantly narrowing area, beat them
to death, as in the wolf hunt of old. This
is to be a scientific experiment.
Professor Lawrence Bruner. who is re
garded as the greatest authority on. grass
hoppers in the world, and was employed
by the Argentine republic some years ago
to rid that country of devastating locusts,
is to be the leader of thÂ© huiit, and hÂ« is
now sending out circulars explaining his
xnoda of attack.
There axe twenty species of grasshop
pers In the United States, and Nebraska
lseffllcted with nine of these. Each be
longs to a. breed that multiplies exceed-
polscn on the wind to be deposited where
somo other hopper is making a meal on
vegetation.
The most popular method of fighting the
grasshopper has been to harrow or disk
the land in which grasshopper eggs* have
been deposited. This stirring of the soil
not only destroys many eggs, but also ex
poses tha remainder to the sun or the
birds and parasites. It is also a good
thing for tho alfalfa crop. Crosa disking
generally ends the grasshopper, but It is
necessary to go not only over cultivated
land, but also along irrigating ditches,
old roads and deserted breakings.
The various remedies have been tried,
but still the grasshopper flourishes and
threatens the crops. And so the grand
Hunt is to take place. There will be no
firearms, no clubs. It will be a hunt by
machinery.
The machine is called the hopper-dozer
and can be operated by hand or horse. It
is made of stovepipe Iron by turning up
the sides and ends of the sheet about four
inches in depth. This is mounted on run
ners varying in height according to re
quirements. On a fr-yne back cf Â«,he pan
is stretched a piece of cloth toiprevent tho
insects from jumping over the pan.
When ready for work the pan is partly
filled with water and then some coal oil
is added. If tho ground Is level no crosa
pieces are necessary, but if the pan is to
be used on eloping ground it should bo
made with little partitions every six or
eight inches to prevent the oil and water
running to one end. The height of the
runners varies from two to ten inches, dÂ«
pendlngr'upon the crop to be protected and
the age of. the insects to be eapturod.
The results are surprising. The hoppors
are simply mowed down. They como leap
ing toward the strange smelling liquid:
then they want to leap out again, but the
oil kills them. When the dozer sets full
ir.gly and does great damage to vegeta-.
tion. The four most numerous species are
the two-lined, the differential, the red
legged and the lesser migratory. The two
first named are, when full grown, an inch
and a half from forehead to tip of wing.
and the others only a trifle moro than an
inch, with bodies in proportion.
ThÂ© hatching is all done In the earth.
The female seeks a favorable spot and
lays her eggs. One female will lay 100
czss in a season. Usually only a single
generation of these insects is raised In a
year. It is calculated that under favora
ble conditions the number la Increased
fifty time* each year.
This is what haa happened in Western
and Southwestern Nebraska, in the alfalfa
country, where no fanner Is content un
less he gets four crops a year of that for
zg* plant. Tho hoppers are overrunning
everything and the farmers have begged
the scientists to relieve them. The scien
tists say that the unusual increase in the
hoppers is due to the fact that several sea
sons have been, very dry In that region,
which lessens the liability of the hopper
to disease and at the same time kills off
the parasites that look upon hopper meat
as the darky does upon possum.
The scientists have tried several oia
remedies, but they haven't worked well.
Insect-destroying fungi halted the hop
pers for a time, but they seem to have
secured an antidote for some of these
fungi and the only death-dealing fungus
is that known to botanists aÂ» JEmpusi
gryllae. This causes an epidemic when
ever it can be propagated.
When once attacked the hopper climbs
up the stem of some weed or other plant
and securely attaches itself by tightly
hugging the plant with its front and mid-
joints and the dust-like spots carry the
die legs. In this position It dies. A few
day3 after dÂ«ath the body opens at the
In tho last n!xty years the speed of
ocean steamers hes increased from eight
and a half to twenty-two and a half knot*
an hour. . .
The heat of midsummer brln^g out tlie
grasshopper crop, and tl\en it i* that the
blsr hunt with tho horper-dozer is to be
gin. A number of these aro now; being:
made at the agricultural exporlmont sta
tion in Lincoln for ahlpment in farmers.
The Grasshopper has all seasons for
hatching, but most of the eggs are laid in
the fall. Some live over winter in the
form of larvae, others hibernate as full
grown Insects, but most kinds the
winter months in 1 the egg state. The
young work their way from, the eggs in
the sod to the surface of the ground by
a twisting or writhing motion. Almost
Immediately after attaining tho surface
the little hoppers shed a covering envelop
and set free the antennae, mouth parts
and limbs. In a short tlma they bacumo
somewhat hardened and begin to hop
about in Quest of food. When first hatched
they aro nearly white, but soon become
dark colored.
the dead insects are shoveled out, a little
more ol! added and the machine is started
again. Bushels of hoppers can be de
stroyed in a single day. It is with these
hoppers thatthe hunt is to be conducted.

PARIS, May 18.â The HeraldY
European edition publishes
the following medical edito
rial on Mrs. McKinley's ill
ness and its treatment:
"According to latest dis
patches the ailment from which Mrs
McKinley suffers is dysenteric fever'
The wife of the President is extremely
feeble, and her disorder very ',j r ave
Dysenteric fever is indeed a very grave
disorder, ofmicrobic origin, occurring
most frequently in hot climates, al
though not unknown in temperate' cli
mates. Even though her condition be
serious, however, she is not necessarily
beyond therapeutic resource.
"In IndcnChina, where a dysenteric
fever is of very frequent occurrence,
physicians treat it with a decoction of
simaruba, which in recent times seem
to have been very effective. Simarabu
should be administered with care, as the
plant contains an irritating essential oil
which at times 13 hurtful to the stom
"Another method of treatment em
ployed during the last century by Jesuits
of Brazil and Paraguay consists in the
administration of a decoction of ipecac.
This method of treatment has become
classic. It is still employed under the
name of 'Brazilian method.' and at times
has produced marvelous results. It con
sists in taking from four to eight
grammes of ipecac root coarsely pulver
ized and pouring over it 150 scrambles oi
hot water. After thorough infusion the
liquid is poured off and administered to
the patient, one tablespoonful per hour
as long as vomiting and diarrhea con
tinue.
"A French military physician named
Boudin has successfully employed the
following remedy: Ipeca, 0.30 gr.;
calomel, 0.03 gr.; opium extract. 0.06 jjr.
This quantity is divided into three'pills.
which the patient should take an hour
apart. â¢ If the patient is very weak, or if
he be already by long dura
tion of the disorder,- it-wjill be profitable
to administer a large injection of artia
cial serum."
ALTHOUGH there was a
slight increase in the temper
ature of Mrs. McKinlev last
evening the distinguished pa
tient passed a comfortable day
and her strength continued to increase.
It cannot be said, however, that the
President's wife is out of danerer. The
physicians have so far successfully
combated the dread dysenteric fever
that has brought the Lady of the White
House to the verge of death, but nature
must now reassert herself and help the
gentle sufferer back to health.
The increase of strength each hour
brings Mrs. McKinley further from the
danger point, and the President yester
day was very hopeful that his beloved
wife would be spared to him.
Yesterday morning it was announced
that Mrs. McKinley had passed a com
fortable night, and the President also
enjoyed a well earned repose.
The chief executive awaited the ar
rival of the physicians before deciding
positively that he would attend the
launching of the battleship Ohio at the
Union Iron Works.
Drs. Hirschfelder, Gibbons and Cush
ing arrived at the Scott home at 8
a. m. and at once held a consultation
with Dr. Rixey. Their report of Mrs.
McKinley' s condition was so favorable
that the President decided to witness the
launching of the battleship.
The consulting physicians left the
house at 8:45 a. m., and Secretary Cor
telyou immediately issued the followincr
bulletin to the newspaper representa
tives:

"Drs. Hirschfelder. Gibbons and
Cushing met Dr. Rixey at 8 a. m. and
found Mrs. McKinlcy's condition de

The distinguished patient was able to
partake of a light breakfast, and the
President remained with his wife until
9:42 a. in.; when he left the house to
proceed to the Union Iron Works.
As on the previous day a large crowd
gathered early in the day to watch for

The President remained by his wife's
side until a late hour and then retired to

during the night, and with the newspa

The President held in his left hand a
beautiful bouquet of roses, presented to
him at the transport dock when' he en
tered his carriage to drive home. As
the chief executive walked; to the Scott
house he inhaled the perfume of the
flowers, and it was learned later that he
carried them to his suffering wife when
he went to her room.
Secretary Cortelyou was seen soon
after the President reached the house
and stated that Mrs. McKinlev was
resting comfortably and that the physi
cians would not hold another consul

CEOWD IS DISAPPOINTED.
It was thought that the President
might go for a drive in the afternoon,
and the crowds in the park facing the
house lingered in the hope of seeing
the distinguished chief again, but they
were disappointed. The President
spent the afternoon either in his wife's
room or in receiving the members, of

WITH THE LAUNCH
MRS. McKINLEY CONTINUES TO SHOW
SLIGHT SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
Finding: of Some Old uiant powder ina
Basement Furnishes Morning: Paper
flaterial for Ridiculous Story.
Out of a disordered reportorial garret
has been evolved a wondrous tale of how
a decrepit old, Chinese fisherman, yclept
a highbinder, had concealed a' mass of dy
namite, sufficient to blow a whole block
of Chinatown over to Oakland, when
President McKinley should' visit that show
section of San Francisco.
r LurIdly yellow, like the dragon flag, was
the tale. To add further effect, or per
â¢haps,' sympolize the dragon, a coll of in
sulated copper wire was found conven
iently _ near. _ AU ..this stage property be
ing located in the ( cellar of the Chinese
Theater at 816 Washington Btreet by in
spectors, of the Board of Health. It was
sent up to the "garret, pending investiga
tion.
Never in all the published itineraries of
the â¢ President has eVer~been 'mentioned a
trip to Chinatown. So the alleged attempt
to be made by desperate highbinders on
the life of the city's guest seems to fall
flat, but -when the owner of the building
admits that he knew the giant powder
had been in the cellar for seven years
even before the election of McKinley to
his first term of offlce^ â and the grime and
the dirt that covered it bear mute evi
dence of the fact, this theory, if not
the "dynamite," has been exploded.
Although the scene of the discovery
was within a minute's walk of the Cen
tral police station, the heads of that de
partment were not advised of the matter.
The "find" was mysteriously spirited
away, and without attempt being made
to discover what it was, was dumped into
the bay by order of Dr. Lawlor of the
State Board of Health, who superintends
the cleansing of Chinatown. Perhaps it
is now in order to accuse Dr. Lawlor of
having felt designs upon the life of the
President. It is, just as probable that,
knowing the course the tug that was to
convey the President to the launching
would take, he had it thrown into some
shoal spot, hoping that the compact of
the \ceel or the puff-puff coming out its
yellow striped smokestack might set the
"tarnal" stuff off.
Legislature Spoiled Lim's Plan.
But that giant powder has a history,
reading like a yellow journal romance,
according to the investigations of.Detec
tive George McMahon, who was detailed
to assist en the: police end of the explo
sion that 1 ailed to occur. â¢ â¢
Ah Lim was a Chinese fisherman, who
at odd times worked as a miner for Jung
Cum Lung, at Poverty Flat, Bownievillo
and other places in Sierra N County, j J ung
Cum Lung says that Ah Lim was about
to return to China and engage in the
fishing industry on the Yangtsekiang or
other river and wanted to' Introduce' more
modern methods into the catching of fish.
But just about the time Ah Lim got the
giant powder to this city and properly
stored in the basement, where he "took
up his residence, the Legislature passed
a law making it a misdemeanor to have
certain explosive compounds in one's pos
session. -Ah Lim, failing to find an op
portunity to carry the stuff to China,
covered it. up "and- left it. ' There if lay
harmless. ....
Where the highbinder who was supposed
to have touched off the explosive' would
have concealed himself Is something the
man with the j disordered Â¦ garret 'should
explain, as the coil of insulated wire was
not long enough to connect with the near
est-light wire and leave him much mar
gin.
"Were it not for the fact that some
people take these matters^ seriously,'.' re
marked Captain of Detectives Seymour,
"this would be a funny proposition. There
are lots "of cranks that seize an oppor
tunity such as is afforded by the" pub
lication of a story of this kind, 'it is the
sheerest, rankest kind of nonsense. ..The
Chinese who owns the building knew that
this giant powder had been in that cellar
for fully seven years. It cannot be ex
ploded except by concussion and was per
fectly harmless at all times." ,.

'..'â¢:-'Â¦ Commercial Street. . .,;.... f,
San Francisco,. May. 18. 1931.
- Editor San Francisco Cal^-Dear Sir: Seeing
la* a ' local newspaper called the Examiner -an
article of to-day' a date;' headed "Dynamite
.found beneath the theater President McKlnley
was to visit,'. 1 we deem, it our duty, to say
a few. words on. the matter' so as to avoid_any
possible misrepresentation or misunderstand
lng.-'f,:Â¦â¢_â¢:'.;,;.Â¦'â¢' â¢ - ' :
In. the!. first place every Chinese knew some.
timiTago that the President and Cabinet could
"not find time to accept the Chinese Invitation
to visit Chinatown; and In the second instance ,
that the Washington-street theater In which
this awful dynamite alleged to have bean
found was never intendedâ even if the Presi
dent was coming to Chinatown, should be the
one he shall v visit. We had intended to have
a special performance in the banquet^ hall at
one end of which a stage was to' be erected/
so that "the President could not be annoyed
by the crowd. '-.:Â¦ ", 'Â¦'..'â¢'
We are at a loss to know how the' Examiner
could have originated such a "cock and bull"
story as to make it appear, possible . that this
dynamite' was ever intended* for 'the President.
We. could only account for this mean conduct
by that paper's policy and longing at times of
using the Chinese as ignorant tools and of their
desire to bring the President's name into noto
riety whenever they see a chance. Their note
worthy insulting cartoon and' references about
the President and. party, -which appeared in
many or their former and recent" Issues, .are
striking instances- of their meanness- which
must be condemned by all, for it looks very
peculiar-even to the "heathen Chinee." I 1^. 110
country in the world would such insults; to its
chief- executive be allowed or toterated,âespe
cially to a President who has proven his ability
and patriotism, and is beloved by all. In in
sulting and ridiculing him the* Examiner not
only insults him but insults the American peo
ple, as he was chosen by the public or citizens
of t>-e United States.- . . .
We object to be made suspicious and. possible
would-be murderers of the world-honored Presi
dent or any one else, simply to gratify a spite
ful paper's desire.s, the same as we objected to
be made 'into plague bacilli.

Report Submitted for Con
sideration by General '
Assembly.
" PHILADELPHIA, May, 18.â Contrarv to
expectations, tho ' Presbyterian Qeneral'
'Assembly did not discuss the report of the
committee on 'revision of the creed of
faith, which was to-day, presented to the
commissioners. Y Thursday , and - Friday
next were set aside for the discussion of
revision. , ' Â¦â¢
Appended to the report of the twentieth
century fund committee -were resolutions
which urge churches still burdened with
.indebtedness to take steps to remove such
within the. next j two years; reauestlne
congregations and individual slvers to
"prayerfully consider the enlarged needs
and larger opportunities of the boards of
the' theological seminaries, "of the academ
ic, collegiate and charitable Institutions of
the church, and - speedily to provide for
those greater needs as the . Lord may en
able them to do"; calling upon the synods
and the Presbyterians .: to "continue to
prosecute this work during the" ensuing
year by. organized effort i and the hearty
co-operation with the general committee,
and providing that the twentieth century
movemenrbe continued for anoher year.
,- The -â¢ revision report, after a large
amount of preliminary matter, continues
as. follows: .
V After the patient consideration given to this
important subject, and after a protracted but
harmonious discussion of the subject in all its
bearings and in its possible issues, it -was de
termined to submit to the general assembly to
convene in Philadelphia, May 16, 1901, the fol
loging findings and recommendations, viz. : v
1. That the returns indicate that the church
desires some change in its credal statement.
2. That the returns Indicate that no change Is
desired which would in any way impair the in
tegrity of the system of doctrine contained in
the confession of faith.
Â¦ 3. These returns indicate that It Is' the mind
of the church that the confession shall be in
terpreted throughout . in harmony with the
teaching of Scripture that God is not willing,
that any. one should perish, nor is it the decree
of God, but the wickedness of their own hearts,
which shuts some men out , from the salvation
freely and lovingly offered in Christ Jesus to
all sinners. Â¦ â¢
. 4. These returns Indicate that a plurality of
the Presbyteries desire that changes should be
made by some new statement of present doc
trines, i ' . _.."'. - .- - - . - "- - Â¦
5. The returns also indicate a desire on the
part of many Presbyteries for some revision of
the present confession, especially in chapter III,
chapter X. section S; chapter XVI; section 7;
chapter XXII, section 3, and chapter XXV,
section 6, with additional statements concern-
Ing the love of God for all men, missions and
the Holy Spirit. ,
(a) In view of these facts we recommend
that a committee, aa provided for by the form
of government, chapter XXIII, section 3, be
appointed by this assembly.
(b) We recommend that tfiis committee- be
instructed to prepare a brief summary of the
reformed faith, bearing the same relation to
the confession which Â¦Â¦ the shorter catechism
bears to the larger catechism, and formed on
the general model of the consensus creed pre
pared for the assembly of 1S92. or the articles
of faith of the Presbyterian Church of Eng
land, .both of which documents are appended
to the -committee's report and submitted to
the assembly to be referred to the committee
that may be appointed.
This summary is not to be a substitute for
the confession, and is not to affect the terms
of subscription, but to vindicate and clear the
doctrines of the church from all false asper
sions and misconceptions, to give a better un
derstanding of what is most surely believed
among us, and Is in no sense to impair, - but
rather to manifest and maintain, the integrity
of the reformed faith.
(c) We further recommend that . this com
mittee be Â¦ Instructed to *. prepare amendments
of chapter III; chapter X, section 3; chapter
XVI, section 7; chapter XXII. section 3, and
chapter XXV, section 6, of our confession of
faith, either by modifications of the text or by
declaratory statement, so as more clearly to
express the mind of the church with additional
statements concerning the love of God for all
men, missions and the Holy Spirit. It being
understood that the revision shall' in no way
impair the Integrity of the system of doctrine
set forth in our confession and taught in the
Holy Scriptures. ,..,
The members of the committee appointed by
â¢the last assembly unanimously agreed to all
the findings and recommendations of this re
port, with the exception that Rev. Dr. : Wil
liam McKlbbon and K. C. "W. . Humphrey
could not approve of - the recommendation to
the assembly to instruct the committee that
might be appointed to prepare a summary oÂ£
the reformed Â¦ faith to be submitted to the
presbyteries. In connection with such other
amendments and statements as might be pre
pared. These members gave notice that they 1
would submit to â¢ the assembly a report em
bodying thei findings and recommendations of
this report.- omitting the recommendation to
instruct a committee that might be appointed
to prepare such a summary of the reformed
faith.. .
In conclusion we feel Justified in the state
ment, and we think it fitting to state, that
our late lamented - member. General Benjamin
Harrison, gave clear expression to views be
' fore i the committee which assure us that he
would have joined us in the. findings and rec
ommendations of this report.
The report of the committee on mis
sionary and benevolent offerings did not
meet with favor by a majority of the
committee. A recommendation Is made
adding to overture No. la new section
as follows: .
The component parts of a particular church
are: The sessions, the deacons, the communi
cant members, with their : baptized children ;
the Sabbath school, with its scholars, teachers
and of fleers; the various societies or agencies
organized for the carrying on of Christian -work
and development , of Christian . life. ' r ,
The Rev. Dr. George TV Purves of New
York made a motion referring the report
to thÂ© ; committee on church polity. He
said he feared such an addition â¢ to the
overture might introduce a new definition
of the church and that this -/ definition
might be used to the serious detriment
of the> church , in the fact that Sunday
school children would be allowed a .vote
In church - meetings. !
John Willis Baer of Boston, secretary
of. the Christian Endeavor Society, spoke
in favor of the report on the ground that
if adopted it would - be the first time in
the history of the church the Christian
Endeavorers and Sabbath school children
were given constitutional recognition In
the church. The report was referred to
the Â¦ committee on church polity.

CAPTAIN SIGSBEE'S DAUGHTER ETHEL
MAY CHRISTEN BATTLESHIP MAINE
From letters found in his pockets it
might be judged that Morgan Is a nephew
of J. Pierpont Morgan, the New York
multi-millionaire. This the 'man claims
?.hen hard pressed by the authorities. He
pays his relatives, including J. Pierpont
Morgan, sent him to California to get rid
cf him.
Morgan is well spoken and apparently
lias had the advantages of a good educa
tion, but strong drink has materially
d^dened his senses. When he appeared
in court to-day he -was ready to pay his
fine, but Judge Morgan sent him. to Jail
for five days in an endeavor to bring him
to his senses. Three months' imprison
ment probably will be the next dose.
LOS ANGELES. May lS.-During .the
last six months a large, square-shoul
dered, athletic appearing fellow has fre
quently been arrested by the local police,
the charge each time being drunkenness.
His clothing is torn and shabby, yet he
nearly always has money In his pockets.
The name "Dan W. Morgan" appears
upon the police records oftener than those
of any other five drunkards, and he has
the reputation of having been sentenced
more times and paid more tines than any
cne within 100 miles of this city.
Morgan came to this city about seven
months ago from New York, his relatives
having sent him in the hope that new sur
roundings and exile from his old consorts
would tend to induce him to reform and
become a respected member of society.
When he arrived in Los Angeles he was
well -drsscd. but it was not many days be
fore- he had sold his clothes and purchased
second-hand garments. With the margin
he frequented salcons, and before long
the money was in the coffers of the liquor
merchants. Later Ills remittance came
pr.d again he went on a wild spree.
Once a month he receives a remittance.
and he remains drunk as long as the
money lafts.

to say ls a member of one of the organiza

to be relegated to a secondary and side posi

STRIKES THE SOURCE
A Pile Cure That Goes to the Boot of
tho Disease.
There are lots of lotions, oils and salves
that will, through their soothing influence,
relieve temporarily the pain Incident to
piles. But Is that all the sufferer requires?
Isn't It a horrible thought to realize that
the ease ls only temporary and the dis-
ease goes on under the surface without a
moment's Interruption? Wouldn't It be
wiser to select a remedy that seeks the
source and regulates those deep-seated
disorders which induce the disease?
Pyramid Pile Cure not only relieves the
pain at once, but effects a permanent cure
of the worst form of piles.
You don't have to go through a tedious
course of dieting while using it either. It
strfkes through those delicate membranes
and tissues and sets the blood in healthful
circulation, reducing, at once the painful
inflammation and congested tumors.
This remedy Is not a haphazard combi-
nation of drugs, but is a remedy invented
by specialists who have treated piles and
blood disorders successfully for years.
Manufactured by the Pyramid Drug Co.,
at Marshall, Mich. Almost any first-class
druggist has it on sale.
Don't treat this disease with every j
lotion and salve that comes along. Re- j
member the parts affected are among the
racst delicate in the human body. This
remedy is absolutely safe and no one need
tear to apply it f reefy on the most in- j
fljimed parts. The speed with which it al- |
lays the pain is an agreeable surprise to j
the sufferer. ' Â¦

How many mothers realize that when
the baby's advent is expected they need
strength for two instead of one. Wom-
en, weak, nervous, "just able to - drag
around," find themselves confronted
Â¦with coming maternity. They have
not strength enough for themselves, how
can they have strength to give a child?
We don't look for the birth of strong
ideas from a weak mind. .Why should
we expect the birth of strong children
from weak mothers?
The way to ensure health and strength
j _ to mother and child
I ' Â£&||A is to use Dr. Pierce's
jMg/j&M Favorite Prescription

"I wish to let you know the great benefit my
wife derived through taking your ' Favorite
Prescription,'" writes Mr. Robert Harden, of
Brandon, Manitoba, Box 235. "It was when-
her baby came. We had heard so much of
your medicine that my wife decided to try it.
( I may . say . my wife's age was thirty-three
and this was her first child). She commenced
to take,* Favorite Prescription ' five months be-
fore her child was born. We have a fine healthy ,
girl, and we believe that this was mainly owing
to the 'Favorite Prescription,' taken faithfully
according to directions, i We shall certainly rec-
ommend it wherever we can." . ;

Nearly 400 members of the Order of the
Eastern Star, including Grand Matron
Mrs. Bowes, Grand Patron E. "W. Conant,
Grand Secretary Mrs. AVillats, and other
grand officers and past patrons and ma
trons of lodges, assembled last night in
Commandery Hall of the Masonic Temple.
The occasion was the official visit of the
grand matron. During the evening John
Tonningren, the patron, stated that the
chapter's invitation on a gold plate ex
tended to Sister Mrs. William McKinley
to attend the session had been delivered,
but her condition, of course, prevented an
acceptance. He added that yesterday
morning, at the request of President Mc-
Kinley, he called at the residence. of Mr.
Scott, jvhen the President, on behalf of his
wife, informed him that the invalid great
ly appreciated the kind remembrance of
her sisters of California Chapter and ex
tended thanks for the costly invitation.
Three candidates were initiated to dem
onstrate how well the officers performed
the work. The officers were highly com
mended by the grand matron. The candi
dates were Hiram D. and Lillian M. Nich
ols and Burt Davis. Mrs. Lizzie Tonnin
gren, the worthy matron, who is also
grand sentinel, on behalf of California
Chapter, .presented the grand matron a
handsome souvenir spoon. For the first
time in the history of the order in this
State, the tables used by the live points
of the central star were superceded by
white Corinthian and doric columns, on
each of which stood a cystal vase filled
with flowers of the color of the point of
the star. The effect was novel and very,
pretty. After the cermonies there was a
collation for all. ...

arrests have been made in this case.
WASHIXGTpx. May 18.â The War De
partment has' received, through Colonel
Mills, superintendent of the military
academy, the report of the board of offi
cers which investigated the disorders
which occurred at the academy about a
month ago as the result of the imposition
by court-martial of a severe punishment
upon Cadet Officer Ralston for his failure
to maintain discipline at the mess tables.
The record of. the court-inartial in Ral
ston's case has been filed in the War De

confinement within the limits of. the post
and much additional duty. Is in process of
execution.

Father Burns, pastor of the Immaculate
Conception Church, also spoke to the
crowd and asked them to preserve the
good name of the town. The crowd lis
tened attentively and respectfully, but re
newed the efforts for the negroes as soon
as the speakers had finished. At 1:40 this
(Sunday) morning. Sheriff McCormick of
IJayette arrived here with a force of dep
uties and succeeded in placing the negroes
on a special train, which is now taking
them to- the jail at Uniontown.
Shortly after midnight William Moore,
son of the murdered man, came from his
house. He mounted the steps in front of
the lockup and said:
"For my mother's sake and for my own
sake, I ask the mob to disperse. I don't
want the negro dragged out and you
should not want him."
Suddenly down the street came a crowd
of men bearing a telephone pole, which
the crowd speedily took and, using it as
a battering ram, began to knock down
the walls of the building. By 11 o'clock
the mob had used the battering ram so
effectively that the outer wall broke
through. Exposed and showing plainly
under the electric light within stood the
negroes. The officers threatened to shoot
the first man who attempted to enter, and
thus succeeded in holding back the mob.
Then the mob formed for a determined
assault upon the building. Half a dozen
officers blockaded the narrow aisle lead
ing from the outer doors to the cells
shouting for the lives of the prisoners.
The officers stood firm. A few minutes
before 10 o'clock a few leaders of the mob
succeeded in getting inside and opened
lire with revolvers on the negroes through
the bars. The officers fired in the air and
drove back the men with revolvers.
Within a few minutes the Jail was sur
rounded by a crowd of enraged citizens.
In the midst of them were Moore's three
sons, crying and adding to the excite
ment and the bitterness of the crowd.
Early this evening when the streets
were crowded Â¦ with the Saturday night
throngs, William Moore and Baggage
master Johnston of the Fairmont branch
train were attacked by the negroes as
they turned into an alley from Main
street, going: toward the rear entrance of
of Hotel Haas. Moore was struck with
a brick on the head and fell forward.
Quick as a flash the negro Fairfax leaned
down over the prostrate victim, jerked
his watch from his pocket, took his
money from his clothing and then took
the unconscious body in his arms and
hurled It over a stone wall, a distance of
thirty feet. Moore was not : dead Â¦when
he was hurled over the wall, but the fall
broke his neck and he died instantly.
The murder was done right in the heart
of the city. When a crowd from Main
street pressed upon the negroes they ran
down the alley, but The wife, throwing
stones and bricks, held the crowd back
until three policemen rushed in upon her
and dragged her away to the lockup. Lat
er Fairfax was captured and locked in
jail.
CONNELLSVILLE, Pa., May 18.â Five
thousand frantic white people surrounded
the fragile little lockup in the town hall
here to-night. Behind the cell bars -were
William Fairfax and his wife "Black
El," both colored, who had just murdered

the Baltimore and Ohio. yards.

HENRY MILLER'S APPROACHING

New Yorkers are figuring that by the middle of the century their city .will: be the largest in

V The Chinese are not anarchists. Their feuds are among themselves. They>let the, white peo
ple alone. The ruling class among them, as well as the mass of them, profoundly, respect the Presi
dent, and would resent any attack upon him, or anything to make his sojourn unpleasant. ..
The Examiner's sensation is a blow at San Francisco. It misrepresents our people, adds to
existing misconceptions of us abroad and uses the occasion of the President's visit, .when the eyes
of the world are upon us, to make us appear in a' disgraceful and disreputable light. Such work is
wantonness, not journalism, and should be rebuked effectually by such people as know the relation
between the reputation and good name of thiscity and the prosperity of its .people.;.
IT is to be regretted that the President's visit could not be permitted to pass without the Exam
iner using it to do something tljat injures San Francisco.
v That sheet seized upon an item two weeks old and which had been published in a Chinese
newspaper, tbuching the keeping of a small quantity of dynamite in a Chinese fisherman's quarters,
as the suggestion of a false, faked and "injurious sensation. It worked this up to the effect that the
President's programme included a visit to Chinatown and attendance at the Chinese theater, and
illustrated the falsehood with a diagram showing where the President was to have sat, with the
dynamite right under the spot. Out of this sophisticated situation a story of intended assassination
is evolved which is harmful to San Francisco, an outrage upon the Chinese and a disgrace to jour
nalism. The tour of Chinatown not on the President's programme, nor was a visit to the
Chinese theater. Had he gone to Chinatown he would have been as welcome and as safe as any
where in the United States. The visiting members of Congress did go to Chinatown and the thea
ter, and, of course*, were treated with considerate hospitality.

CAUTOBNIANS IN WASHINGTON
. The trouble with New Englanders seems to be that they have reached the stage of civilization
where they can no longer live satisfactorily on tea and beans. They feel the need of something for
their "stomach's sake," and having forsworn whisky have taken to opium and paregoric. What
they should do is to cultivate the habit of drinking California wine with dinner, and it would seem
that the sooner the doctors, of New England begin to recommend the practice to their patients the
better. We have problems enough in this country without having another forced upon us by the
development of an opium mania among a considerable portion of the population^ - t â¢
Of the consumption of opium he says: "In the regular drugstores and in 160 of the 172 gen
eral stores in the State of Vermont there are sold every month 3,300,000 doses of opium, besides
what is dispensed in -patent medicines and besides what the doctors dispense, which gives one .and
one-half doses of opium to every man and woman in the State above the age of 21 years every day
of the year. By dose I mean one grain opium, one-eighth grain morphine, one-half ounce paregoric
and tweaty drops of laudanum. The amount consumed each month means a half-dose for every
man, woman and .child in the State every day in the year."
It is added that in his report the doctor stated that these figures should be multiplied by five
to get the actual amount of drugs sold in Vermont monthly, for he had: not included drugs sold
from wholesale stores nor those used by practicing physicians for their medicines, nor those used by
manufacturers of medicines.
The information on the subject comes on the authority of Dr. A. P. Grinnell, who is described
by the Boston- Globe as "a reputable medical man," and is contained in a report made by him to
the Vermont Medical Society. The. doctor made a canvass of the stores of the State at. which
drugs are sold for the purpose of determining the extent of their use among th'e^people. From a
good many localities he was not able to get definite information, but in sixty-nine towns from which
statements were obtained it was found that the monthly sale of gum opium was 47 pounds 12 ounces,
of morphine powder 19 pounds 15 ounces, of morphine pills .3338 grains, of dovers powders 25
pounds, of paregoric 32 gallons and 1 quart, of laudanum 32 gallons and 1 quart ? of cocaine 27
ounces, 1 dram and 30 grains, of choral 32 pounds 4 ounces, of Indian hemp 37 ounces, of quinine
ponders 15 pounds 10 ounces, of quinine pills 74,200. . . '
OF all the stories that have recently come from New England showing a change for the worse
among the people of that good old Puritan stpek none is more curious or startling than a
report just made public concerning the growing use of drugs in Vermont. The people of*
that State have been believed to lead healthy and wholesome lives, and yet it now appears they
are addicted to vices which are supp6sed to be peculiar to decadent races.

TO PRESERVE EGGSâ Subscriber, Rl
pon, Cal. When newly laid eggs are al
most perfectly full, but the shell being
porous the watery portion of the con
tents begin to evaporate through the
pores the moment they are exposed to the
air, so that egrgs become lighter every
day. To preserve the interior of eggs in
the natural state it is necessary to seal
up the pore3 of the shell air-tight. This
may be done by placing the eggs in melt
ed suet, o!Ue oil, milk of lime, solution of
gum arable or covering them with any
air-proof, scentless -varnish. When they
have been thus prepared they may then
be packed in bran, oats, meal, salt, ashes
or powdered charcoal. It is also stated
that covering eggs with a coating of
paraffin or two coats of collodion will pre
serVe them.
INDIAN LANDSâ P. M. P., Lorin, Cal.
The new Indian lands will be opened \ in
Aue-ust. The lands involved are the Kiov/a,
Ccmanche and Apache reservations and the
smaller sections known &a the "Wichita and
affiliated tribes reservation. The Kiowa lands
lie on the Washita and lied River and North
Fork of Red River. There are 2,968,893 acres
in the strip, larger than Connecticut and three
times as large as Delaware. The Wichita
reservation is bounded north by the South
Canadian River, Â¦ east by Indian Territory,
south by the Washita River and on the wcat
by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indian lands
now marked as Custer and Washita counties,
Oklahoma, on the maps. In this tract is
713,610 acres. North to south the two tracts
measure 114 miles, and east to west 81 miles.
One who has investigated the lands Bays:
It Is not a farming country, but a cattle
country. Rainfall is very infrequent. The In
dians are taking the choicest claims along the
Ftreams. There are already five white men
for every good claim. Farming does not pay
at all. Fruit raising has not been successful.
Any one who is a citizen of the United
States or filed a declaration to become a citi
zen, male or female, or a deserted wife or
widow, can file a claim on a quarter section
of land provided that they have not made a
previous entry under the United States law or
commuted their entry to cash payment or is
already the owner of 160 acres. Kx-soldiere
or their widows or minor children can enter
by filine in person or by agents, and have six
months in which to commence settlement.
There are numerous swindlers as agents. Fil
lns fees are $14 for ICO acres. After five years'
residence on the land proof Is made at the
I^and Office, and by paying ?1 23 per acre a
deed trill be issued by the United States Gov
ernment- This deed can be obtained after
fourteen months' residence. Only or.e quarter
eeetion can be entered by one person. A few
permanent improvements must be made. The
school lands can be obtained on long leases.
Anadarko and Kort Sill will likely be the
county seats named in the President's procla
mation. They have good railroad connections
The Indians will lease their best bottom lands
' at about $1 per acre, and some as low as
j twonty-flve cents per acre.
Thousands of people are camped en . the bor
der and wagons hurrying from all parts of the
country. The rush to secure the landa prom
ises to be ,

THE clIniEiJc conditions of every
large city in the United States ex
cept San .Francisco make winter
the season of theatric glory and v
summer the season of theatric
discontent. â¢ With us these conditions are
reversed. . In the winter we are com
pelled to plod the weary round cf the old
plays, given sometimes well, sometimes
iidifCerently. soi-^etimes indifferent-well;
in the spring time our fancy lightly turns
to thoughts of newer and better things.
We have already had occasion to wel
come "Sag Harbor" as the harbinger of
these things : it is now our pleasant duty
to record the return of one who. both as
an artist and a man, must ever hold a
large place in the affections qf those who
have seen and known him. I refer, 'of
course, to Mr. Henry Miller, who begins
a too brief engagement at the Columbia
Theater to-morrow evening â an engage
ment which raises pleasant anticipations
â¢that are bound to be realized, because
based upon past promises faithfully kept.
Mr. Miller promises us Louis Parker's
â¢â¢Gudgeons'," an unsavory title for a
eavory play that is not new to San Fran
cisco, but is worth reviving for the ex
cellent opportunities it affords Mr. Miller.
This play, if I remember correctly,
ihough nearly eight years old, has never
been ruined for intelligent peopls as have
"Madame Sans Gene" and "The Middle
man" by being sublet to cheap com
panies; before enjoying Mr. Miller's
James Ffclliott Treherne. therefore, the
spectator is not obliged painfully to ob
literate the impression made by some one
of Nature's journeymen who has essayed
the character in true groundling style.
That's a blessing devoutly to be thank
ful for! -
Mr. Miller also promises us The Im
portance of Being Earnest," one of the
most delicately amusing comedies of the
nineteenth century, written by a man
â¢who, had he possessed moral fiber no
more robust than was even Sheridan's,
mMit have written a second "School For
Scandal." This play Mr. Archer de
scribes as an "iridescent filament of fan
tasv â¢ â¢ â¢ a sort of rondo capriccioso,
in'which the artist's fingers run with crisp
irresponsibility up and down the key
board cf life."
Then we are to have "Richard Savage,"
a. play which, if It may not entirely please,
can hardly fail to interest for one hear
ing by the very unconventionally of its
themeâ maternal hate. Lastly we are
premisedâ no, threatenedâ with "Hearts
case" again, a masterpiece which â¢ â¢ â¢
But this is with me a topic too painful
and too deep either for discussion or for
tears. If Mr. Miller were to play nothing
but "Heartsease" he would become as rich
as did Denxnan Thompson by sticking to
â¢â¢The Old Homestead," or Joseph Jeffer
scn by sticking to "Rip Van Winkle." It
is very noble in him, then, I think, to
play it no oftener than he does; by re
fusing honest dollars, as he does every
time he withdraws this play, he offers
unon the altar of his art a pecuniary sac
rifice the like of which I fear that I should
be quite incapable cf making.
After all, the sentiment in "Heartsease"
is not bad. I suppose what bores and of
fends us of an older generation is the ex
treme obviousness cf the construction and
the appalling commonplace of the dia
logue. But these faults are scarcely no
ticed bv the lovely young person, who
through the sensuous mist of the music
hears only the throbbings of a heart that
beats in unison with hers. And there have
been even subtle poets who maintain that
t':e has chosen the better part. -

Sir. Herbert Stone sends me from Chica
go a book entitled "Some Players," by Amy
Leslie. There are some sixty or seventy
actor folk written about here, and look
ing under the chapter entitled "Henry
Miller" I find nothing recorded about him
except that Miss Leslie once took a walk
along the lake shore with Mr. Miller, and
that during: this walk Mr. Miller made
a good joke. He is quite capable of that
and it Is distinctly to his credit,- yet 'tis
a somewhat disappointing amount of bi
ography, even when stretched to a page
and a half in a book that devotes twenty
pages of Lillian Russell, who could never
act, and nine to a celebrity named Charlie
Ross, whose fame seems not yet to have
spread beyond the confines of Greater Chi
cago.
Miss Leslie's judgments are no iess ex
traordinary than her principles of selec
tion. Thus we are told (p. 2S0) of Miss
Marine Elliott, who has certainly leariicd
something from Mr. Goodwin, but who
has yet a great deal to learn, that her
talents are of "an "exceptionally delicate
and vigorous quality." One could say no
more of a Helen Faucit or a Rachel; if it
is true of them it is not true of actress.es
like Miss Elliott, who, to speak plainly,
hide their light of a very small talent un
der the bushel of much beauty. Of Miss
Maude Adams we are told (p. SC8) that she
is "quite the best dressed actress In the
world"; now this is odd for on page 534 we
are told that Miss Viola Allen "is the best
dressed woman in America." There may
be more things in these mysterious con
tradictions than are dreamed of Jn the
philosophy of the sterner sex, but to one
of that abject class it would seem there
are but two explanations possible of Mis3
Leslie's dictum. Either an actress Is not
a woman or America is not in the world.
All the men and women of Miss Leslie's
acquaintance are geniuses; let us grant
that and notice the immense versatility
of their talent. The genius of Miss Mary
Mannering is "penetrating and special."
The "physical and mental energy" of Mr.
James O'Neill is "imperishable." while his
voice is one of "melodious splendor."
Madame Calve is "the most strangely
beautiful woman I ever saw," whose
"svelte figure is full of delicately conspic
uous lines of loveliness and her face
white as a lily petal," whose temperament
is "overhuman," whose "intensity" is
"contagious," and whose "divine gifts"
are "beyond compare." Offenbach's bal
lads are* "priceless"; his "Letter Song" is
the "loveliest' love ditty in the world."
Miss Lillian Russell's talents are "splen
did"; there "never was a skin so firm and
transparent ncr a smile so cloying" as
hers, and she can sing "Mollie O" as "it
had never been sung before." More re
markable still; Miss Russell's nine-year
old child is a greater artist (with a more
cloying smile, doubtless) than her mother,
for "she plays the masters with the sa
gacity and exquisite feeling which come
only hand-in-hand and heart-to-heart
with the fire of genius." Paderewski nuist
hide his diminished head.

Mr. Stone generally publishes good
books. It is incomprehensible to me how
he ever allowed his^mprimatur to appear
on anything so hopelessly foolish as Miss
Leslie's "Some Players."

Within the last five years Mrs. Alexan
der has twice spent the summer with us.
The first of these visits was spent, as
this one will be, at Del Monte. Early
the other 'day some of the girls were
laughing over the mishap that spoiled
part of Mrs. Alexander's stay and which
provoked the wrath of a brilliant social
leader who has since went the way of ail
that is mortal.
In this little story a wheelbarrow, two
jolly girls, a shoe and one of the MarUn
boys figured prominently. It appears the
girls, daughters of the fashionable ma
tron, had some sort of a wager with Peter
Martin. They won, and he had to wheel
them through the halls. They chose the
night for their corridor ride. Just as they
were^ being wheeled through the hall In
which the Alexanders were located

of the happy girls, and she caught up a

I hear that Anna Miller "Wood Is going
to Europe to study. Since Mis3 Wood
left a large circle of admiring friends in
this city a few years ago and went to
Boston to let the music lovers of the Hub
enjoy the splendid talent of a gifted Cali
fornia girl, she has forged steadjjy to the
front, until now she is one of the fore
most of Boston's choir singers^ Miss
Wood will probably spend one year abroad
and will study under the best masters.
I do not know whether Miss Wood Is
going to study for the operatic stage or
intends to remain with the concert stage
and choir. This," however, I do know:
She is bound to be a brilliant success In
whatever field she decides to enter. Her
contralto voice is one of rare and rich
qualities and her personality a gracious
and magnetic one.
Dainty Aileen's friends frequently laugh
with- her over the sad plight of Charlie
Mclntosh on his wedding day. His neck
was all bound up and even thÂ© raro de

siioe (left without on a door sill for the
porter's attention) and made an attempt
to hit Peter with it. But her aim was
bad. The shoe -went bang against the Al
exander door^and the next day there were
complaints and hurried departures. That
was fully five years ago. This year the
girl with the shoe and the Alexanders will
again meet at Del Monte.
As she touched the water steam whistles, cannon and brass bands combined in making a vol
ume of glad noise that was never excelled. Long may she float, and -if need be fight, with the zest
for battle in a good cause that has distinguished the sons of the State that godmothers her and
gives her a name. . <-,,---'Â¦ '-
, It is expected that she will lead the line and be the best ship in the navy. San Francisco is
fortunate and happy in being the seat of a shipbuilding industry that can build such craft. We have
had the Governors and worthies of other States here at launchings of warships. Oregon and Wis
consin have sent their official representatives on such occasions, and they have been right wel
come. But we are singularly fortunate in the case of the Ohio in having her flight waterward such
an attractive event that it drew hither not only the able Governor of Ohio and his staff and the
Congressmen from that State, but also the President of the United States and a majority of his
Cabinet.
In other days it seemed a matter of course that the President and the Secretary of the Navy
should run down from Washington to Philadelphia, to Roach's, or Cramps', to see a warship
launched. But now it is made just as convenient and more interesting for them to run out to ihis
city; seeing the widest land on their way, to see the widest water in the world, and to see launched
the best ships that float. . â¢ â¢ - â¢
The Ohio took her baptism under the official eye of the State she represents and that of the
nation she is to serve. * .
The Ohio is the first great warship launched since that demonstration was made. She belongs
to the State line of ships. Great folds of armor plate are imposed, to protect her vitals and her
mechanism will reflect every suggestion gained from the experience of the Olympia, Oregon,
Iowa, Texas and other ships in the Spanish war.
* A modern warship is a very complicated machine. Its development was mainly theoretical. It
is true that the fight between the JVlonitor and Merrimac in Hampton Roads jpbsoleted every ex
isting navy in the world by proving the feasibility of the turret and armor. But when the old navies
were o.bsoleted and the turret gun arid armor plate idea had to be applied in naval architecture,
complication piled on complication in the adaptation of the skin of the ship and its viscera to. the
mechanical methods that became necessary. ' And, after all, it was not certain thafall this* machin
ery would work in action. The Japanese made a partial demonstration in their war with China, but
the complete experiment and proof were left to the American navy in our Spanish war. In Manila
Bay and at Santiago it was proved that the ideas that had originated in American ships, on Amer
ican waters, in our American civil war, were to dominate the navies of the world. The intricate ma
chine was proven workable and in action its complicated mechanism was as simple as a sewing
machine. The use .of steam, hydraulic* power, compressed air and electricity in its operation
proved to be as easy as handling an oar in a rowboat on a summer sea.
SAN FRANCISCO has grown accustomed to the launching of warships. Here many good
ones have glided from the ways to the waves, and among, them the Oregon, the best one
ever biiilt up to her time. * â¢ - .

The newspapers of Austria announce
the formation in Vienna of a club of
divorced women. The club will furnish
moral support and a comfortable meeting
place for women who have been obllgea
to separate from their husbands, and will
use its influence to bring about a reform
ln the Austrian marriage laws, and espe
cially in the clause that enables a hus
band to divorce his wife for "incompati
bility of temper." The object seems a
good one, but there Is something shock
ing to American ideas In the formation of
such a club. A woman may be divorced
entirely without fault on her side, but
it seems in poor taste for her to advertise
her domestic misfortunes. The twelve
founders of this club are most of them
women whose divorces mads a good dea}
of talk in Vienna society at the time.â

Naples to-day of Me tcrranean fever,
after a short Illness. . ae dispatch came
from Mrs. Babcock, who, with her hus
band, has been of a party of clergy tour
ing- through the Mediterranean.
Dr. Babcock was graduated from Syra

a course in the Auburn Theological Semi
nary he was ordained in the ministry in
1882/ His first pastorate was the First
Presbyterian Church of Lockport. â¢ Five

round his wife in the front room, sitting
on a man s lap. He at once rushed uw to
the two, and, although much smaller than
the other man, attacked him, hitting him
in the face. The man ran to the door and
he followed, kicking him as he went.
When they got outside he desisted, as
be saw a policeman across the street, and
called upon the officer to arrest the man,
who was Dr. Bacon. Arguello says that
he then left the house and has not been
back and his visit to the police station
was for the purpose of getting a police
man to go with him to get his clothing.
Policeman Neighbors said he saw part
of the fight after the principals reached
the street and that both men made state
ments to him a>bout the occurrence. He
did not deem it a case for police inter
ference, and so stated, in consequence of
which no arrests were made.
Dr. Bacon said that he was called to
see Mrs. Arguello professionally and was
in the act of making an examination
when the husband burst into the room
and began making all sorts of charges
He talked in such a crazy manner Dr'
Bacon says, that he got up and left the
house. He denies positively that Argu
ello assaulted him or that he was struck.
Dr. Bacon says he cannot understand
why he was dragged into the matter and
does not know whether it Is an attempt
at blackmail or merely a desire on the
part of Arguello to get rid of hla wife.

RETIRED NAVAL OFFICER TO BE TRIED
FOR COMPLICITY IN ARMY FRAUDS
HAMILTON, Ohio, May 18.â The union
machinists have given the manufacturers
of this city until next Wednesday to
grant the demands for a nine-hour day
with 18V4 per cent Increase In wages.
The manufacturers have decided to Â¦ re
fuse .the demand and a strike is inevit
able. There are over 1500 machinists in
the city.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., May 18.â Of the 900
machinists in this city only 260 are mem
bers of the union. The leading employers
said to-day that the union had not pre
sented to them â¢ the nine-hour day and
higher wages demand. Only one com
pany, employing as many as twenty-nve
machinists, has signed the agreement.
Employers do not anticipate any great
interruption of business here on Monday.
A Seneca Falls dispatch says that the
machinists are thoroughly organized
there and it 13 expected that the large
manufacturing companies there will not
concede the demands of the union, which
numbers 500 members. : â¢
Given TJntil Wednesday.
DAYTON, Ohio, May 18.â Not one con
cern in Dayton has acceded to the ma
chinists' demands.* Several . plants have
closed. Thirty-five hundred men are out
of work. The carpenters' strike is prac
tically complete.
fully 8000 will go to'wc-rk Monday under
the . new scale. It is admitted that at
least 4000 men employed in shops which
ha*e refused to accede, to the demands of
the union will be thrown out of work until
the question' between employers and em
ployes is settled. Â¦" .
Â¦ NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 18.â Strikes
of machinists In large chops throughout
Connecticut are expected next Monday as
a result of the refusal of manufacturers
to accede to the demands of the Interna
tional Association of -Machinists for a
nine-hour day.
In Bridgeport the 600 members of the
union voted late last nteht to come out
Monday. Ansonia and Derby manufac
turers assert that the demand is in viola
tion of an agreement entered into by the
International Association of Machinists
and the National Association of Manufac
turers. The Whitlock Machine Company
and the Driggs-Seabury Gun and Ammu
nition Company closed their plants to
night for an indefinite period, and the men
look upon the situation there as.practi
cally a lockout.
In Norwalk, Waterbury and New Brit
ain preparations are being 1 made appar
ently for a prolonged strike by both the
labor leaders and the manufacturers, i
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 18.â President
O'Connell of the International Machinists'
Association said this evening that a strike
of the organized machinists on Monday
was inevitable. Reports received here to
day show determined' opposition to the
demands of the machinists by many of
the large machine shops of the country,
and it Is evident that some of the employ
ers, will refuse to sign the agreement tor
nine hours' work at ten hours' pay. O'Con
nell said:
"We are advised that our demands will
meet with opposition on the Pacific Coast.
The Union Iron Works and several other
large ! establishments positively refuse to
accept our terms. We expect opposition
also in Cincinnati, St. Louis, Denver, Kan
sas City, New York, Brooklyn, Newark,
Paterson, ElmJra, Syracuse,. Rochester,
Seneca Falls, Bridgeport, New Haven,
Boston, Providence and several cities In
the South* There are firms in these cities
which have recognized our demands. Of
course, there will be no strike in those
establishments. : '
"Three very important conferences are
going on with the Brooks Locomotive
Works of New York, the Baldwin Loco
motive Works of Philadelphia and the
Richmond Iron Works. The decision of
these firms is Hkely to have considerable
Influence with other firms.
"We are now able to figure out that 30
per cent of the firms interested are pre
pared to accept our demands. We have a
substantial reserve fund and we are
pledged financial aid from the Federation
of Labor. We are assured of the sympa
thy and support of almost every labor or
ganization in the United States." (
O'Connell said the indications were that
betvJeen 50,000 and 75,000 machinists would
not go to work. About three times as
manv men in other trades would be af
fected.

Releases a Chinese Who Is Wanted
Here to Answer to a Charge
of Murder. .
It Is extremely doubtful If Wong Kong
Chung, the alleged murderer of Suey
Sing in Ross alley, several years ago.
will ever be brought to this city to. be
tried for his supposed crime. Last week
Detective Ed Gibson, after locating his
man in Stockton, had' a warrant Issued
for his arrest for murder. Gibson went
to the Slough City and after placing
Wong Fong under arrest, turned "him
over to the Sheriff to await the departure
of the train for this city. The accused
Chinaman, determining to circumvent the
detective in his efforts to bring, him to
trial . for his alleged crime, sent for an
attorney, who at once sued out a writ of
habeas corpus in behalf of the prisoner,
alleging that he was being unlawfully de
prived of his liberty. The writ was
heard by Superior Judge Budd with the
result that the Chinaman was discharged
from custody, the court holding that in
as much as the warrant failed to describe
the person who was wanted It was fatally
defective.
Determined to get hold of the alleged
murderer Detective Gibson last Friday
went before Judge Carroll Cook, and
after explaining the reason why Judge
Budd discharged the Chinaman, asked
him to draw up a warrant which would
meet with the requirements of the Stock
ton Judge. To overcome the former ob
jections advanced by the Slough City
magistrate Judge Cook inserted in the
warrant" that 1 the defendant was "a
Chinaman," hoping that this would be a
sufficient description of the party who
was wanted.
Yesterday Gibson returned to Stockton
and again placed the Chinaman under ar
rest. His attorney, who had evidently
been apprised of the coming of tho de
tective, immediately sued out a second
writ for the release of his client. The
matter will be heard to-morrow by Judge
Budd and it is foreshadowed by the local
police that the Chinaman will be given
his freedom, for no other reason than
the warrant falls to give a description of
him. '

total of any weakness with which he can be
charged. Ills life was a morally pure one, and
we deplore any suggestion to tho contrary In an
Irresponsible moment by a rum-crazed unfortu

WASHINGTON. May 18.â The Coroner's
Inquiry into the mysterious murder of the
young clerk, James Seymour Ayres Jr.,
at the Kenmore Hotel last Wednesday
morning waa begun to-day. The first wit
ness was Daniel .Woodhouse, colored, em
ployed as a waiter in the hotel, who first
saw Ayres' body after the killing. He
said that he had gone to Ayres' room
about 8:30 that morning at the request of
Miss Mary Minas, who occupied a room
adjoining that occupied by Ayres.
"She asked ma to look into Mr. Ayres*
room and see whether he was up, saying
that she heard strange noises in his room
and was uneasy," said Woodhouse.
He looked through the keyhole and saw
the body lying on the floor. When he told
Miss Minas of his discovery she did riot,
he said, seem in the least disturbed or
agitated. The witness waa questioned
concerning the occupants of other rooms
adjacent to Ayres' apartments. He said
that Miss Hopkins, who occupied a room
on the floor above, was 111 the morning
after the murder, and that he (Wood
house) had taken her breakfast to her.
She had been sick for five or six days.
He had never seen Ayres with Miss Hop
kins, and so far as he knew Ayres had
never paid especial attention to any lady
in the house.
Dr. Glasebrook. who conducted the au
topsy on Ayres' body, expressed the opin
ion that the Imprints on the window sill
were made by one of Ayers' hands. The
size indicated, at any rate, that they were
made by a man's hand. He had found
stains on the fire escape and on the wall
paper, but was satisfied that they were
not blood. ,
James Burns, a Michigan clerk in the
Government Printing Office, said Ayrea
had been formerly- very attentive to Mrs.
Bonine, a guest at the Kenmore, but that
lately there had been coolness between the
two. .,
Miss Mlnas, who had a room next to
Ayres, said Mrs. Bonine had been to
Ayres' room a number of times. At 11
o'clock Tuesday night Mrs. Bonine visited
Misa Minas In the latter's room, wearing
a black and brown wrapper. Mrs. Bonine
explained that she was looking for her son
Morris. Other testimony developed little
of value, and the inquest waa â¢ adjo.urned
until Monday.

proceed directly to that city to serve the

they will be obliged to remain away from

will also bring with them Dudley Du

imprisonment in the Alamecia County

who is "doins" a year.
Should Federal Judpe Noyes be convict

Arizona la now in the midst of a first
class oil excitement. Utah, Wyoming
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Colorado,
In addition to Texas nnd California, are
nleo figuring upon a groat poHHlble future
to bo reiillzod by oil discoveries with the
general underBtnndlng that nn nsreement
will fix tho prlco for fuol oil nt a profitable
IhikIh of production. Indeed there Is no
rcriHon why n (rood prlro should not bo hud
for fuel oil, with llin exception of unneces
sary competition nnionir producers nnd
the HchfmltiK of parties who two trylnjj to
K"t control of Hi" ImihIiiuwh Hint him i><-mi
crented in Rood fnlth by others. Tha k*?in
oral opinion 1h Hint unity of netlon will
iipitly tint remedy tlwtt In needed, i^oRitl
iiiiiiily fuel oil Ihih but ona cQmpotltor nii'i
Unit fit null, oil In m ni'iMi'i- nnd morn
eennomlcnlly handled fuel thnn vtml Is. Oil
ought to bring mm much na coal jnÂ»trmd of
n fraction of tho amount. 8tlll tho UfO*
rtiH'orH do not iitOc for uiiythlin; more tliun
n living prlco. An imllciitlon that is
worthy of notice Is tho utterance of tho
Oil City Derrick, published In Pennnyl
vnnlu, u center of tho ootil Industry und
nlÂ«o of the notrolaum Industry of the East.
Tim Oer'rlck iÂ»nyn thnt tho owners of Tex
ns furl oil will not gin moro thun 10 cunts
a barrel for their produce when It Is laid
down on the Atlantic Coast. There Hre
various Interests opposed to the success
of fuel oil, among which aro the coal
barons. In this State there aro interests
that are concerned In making the price
of fuel oil low for their own ends. In this
category may be Included railroads that
are now using fuel oil instead of coal to a
large extent and naturally wish to Ket the
fuel as cheaply as possible.
The leading symptom of the oil excite
ment in Arizona is a rushing In of out
siders, who are scattering over a wide
area and taking up land In large quanti
ties. According to the reports every avail
able acre of land between Tempe and
Phoenix has been taken up. All the coun
try east of Maricopa is claimed. Sixty
live thousand acres of supposed oil land
have been located in the Texas Hill coun
try. A strip four or five miles wide and
twenty miles long has been plastered with
mineral location notices. The Oatman
Flat section, near Agua Caliente, has r.uw
several thousand acres filed upon.
Progress for April.
The progress made In California in the
oil industry during the month of April, is
summed up by the Pacific Oil Reporter as
follows:
The month of April showed 268 rigs up and
670 drilling in this State. Of these eighty-nine
rigs and 155 drilling wells are located in the
Kern River Held. There were 104 new wells
completed, with a production of 4260 barrels,
a falling off from the preceding month of
thirty-six wells and 617 barrels over the pre
ceding month. The new production Is classi
fied among the counties as follows: Colusa,
one well, twenty barrels; Fresno, seventeen
wells, 380 barrels; McKlttrick and Sunset,
thirteen wells, 605 barrels; Kern River, thirty
three wells, 2475 barrels; Summerland. two
wells, twenty barrels; Huckhorn, one well, 100
barrels; Los Angeles City, sixteen wells, 135
barrels; Puente, one well, fifty barrels; Ful
lerton, eight wells, 385 barrels. The failures
were Humboldt, Ban Benlto, Fresno (3), Tu
lare, McKittrick-Sunset (2), Kern River (3),
Newhall, Whlttier (2), Fullerton (2), Los An
geles County. Orange County, San Diego Coun
ty <z;.
Some one, who is described by the Bak
ersfleld Callfornlan as "a civil engineer,"
has been figuring on tho wealth in oil of
the sands that underlie the Kern River
district. His theory Is that oil sand there
will yield one-tenth of its bulk In oil. On
thla basis he estimates possible produc
tion, taking the whole district together, as
follows:
For 100 feet, 155,400 barrels: 300 feet, 2V.100
barrels; 400 feet, 311,000 barrels; 500 feet, 387,
500 barrels. >
He also figures the cost of bringing a
barrel of oil to the surface in the Kern
River district at? 5 cents. The cost of a well
is stated at 15000, approximately.
More Companies Formed.
New companies Incorporated at Bakers-'
field and the amount of capitalization are
as follows:
La Jolla Oil Company, $1,500,000; Patuxent
Oil Company, $1,000,000; Union Mutual Oil Com
pany, $500,000; Occidental Water Company,
$500,000.
No agreement will bÂ» binding until the
owners of at least 600 wells approve, In writ
ing, the agreement submitted.
All oil above ground on June 1 to be gauged
or reported by the executive committee and
to be held In storage as directed by executive
committee, who agree tr> sell the same one
sixth each month for the next six months, or

1, 1901, or tiooner.
No oil to be marketed from any of the wells

commttteo after June 1.

Facts From the Fields.
Mere than 75,000 acres of land have re
cently been taken up for oil under the
placer mining act in Idaho along a strip
of country forty miles in length on both
sides of the Snake River, Discoveries of
oil are alleged in Canyon County and the
customary booming of imaginary possi
bilities by the use of guileless telegraphic
news agencies is now under way.
Some of the essential provisions n6t here
tofore published here in detail relating to
the proposed association at Los Angeles
of oil producers are as follows:
The Indian Valley Oil Company, operat
ing in San Bcnito County, reports that
it has a well down 105 feet. The Hollister
Petroleum Development Company is down
300 feet. .
The Kern River field is now estimated
to bo about four miles long and capable
of further extension.
Bakersfield will utilize oil in the manu
facture of gas, which will be generally in
troduced into houses.
Oregon is sinking its first oil well at
Sandy River, near Troutdale. Sinking
has" progressed to a depth of 300 f et.
There is trouble over the oil lands at
Beaumont, Texas, because of a provision
in the Texas laws that secures title only
to the land, but gives to the State any
mineral that is found. A suit has been
filed at Austin to compel the Commission
er of the General Land. Office to issue
patents to the lands with the mineral*
rights. There are several suits with dif
ferent issues already filed. . â¢

Some facto may be gleaned from a long
account of the conditions attending min
ing In the Phlllpplnei which a correspond
ent hati contributed to the Mining and
Scientific Prows. There has been Brent
need for coal In the Islands for many
years, the supply being foreign except
email rjuantiticH of poor quality from
mines of moderate nl/.u which Imvo been
operated on tin- Islands of tho southern
portion of th" Philippine group, but tlio

Spaniards never took much Intercut In tho
Iron donorlts. The Hcnreh for petroleum
hus recently been quite keen.
Old-Timo Gold Mines.
The more Interesting Btatements refer to
gold and copper. Concerning gold the cor
respondent writes in part us lollows:
The principal gold mines were found In the
provinces of Ca'narlnes Norte and consider
able metal waiÂ« taken out. In recent years
gold has been found in Mindanao and at the
prewnt lime thorp are several mines operating
there, some having modern machinery. The
grasshopper eaters of Mindanao have for a
long time been coming into the cities and
towns with little nuggetn of gold, which they
traded for articles of food, wear and general
supplies. The mountain tribes of Clmeras and
Negros have also found gold In places and
have menaced to market some of It. The na
tives are very close about revealing the Where
abouts of the mines, for they appreciate the
value of a mine, even though they allow them
selves to be chpated greatly when selling the
product to others. Gold has been taken out
in paying quantities at Tagaulip. Cuena, Mis
amis and on Panay the soldiers have found
gold In the mountains in the interior.
There will be little done, however, in gold
mlnlnsr until quartz crushing machinery Is put
In. The natives'. Spaniards and Chinese have
taken and worked much of the surface or
placer mines. There Is, however, an oppor
tunity for quartz mining and lodes can be
secured in many sections of the archipelago
containing paying quantities of gold. Quartz
veins have been located in Mindanao, Luzon,
Panay, Xesros and Cebu. For a time the
Spanish Government kept records of all min
ing enterprises and a large royalty of the
gold mined had to be turned over to the King
of Bpaln.
Deposits in Sands.
Concerning the once famous Mambule
mines the correspondent says:
They produced at one time about 3000 ounces
of gold monthly, the market price of which
was about J20 an ounce. These old mines were
worked by the natives long before the Span
iards came. Ultimately they passed into the
hands of an English tsyndicate. The English
failed to secure profitable returns from their
investment. They employed the wrong kind
of labor. The Spaniards, knowing the people
of the islands, employed Chinese to operate
the mines and made money. The English dis
charged the Chinese and put in natives, who
would work a few weeks and quit until they
spent the money earned. The native labor can
be hired for 10 or 15 cents per day for mining
work, but will not work steadily. The Chinese
can be secured at practically the same rates
and there are thousand* of them available,
but many foreign Urn.* will not hire them.
The individual native miners depend upon
finding pieces of the precious metal In the
crevices in the mountains and often, months
are devoted to a search which will result In
the finding of a email piece of gold. One can
not remain in any portion of the islands long
without hearing mining stories from natives
and soldiers concerning the existence of placer
deposits, and of streams the beds of which
contain fine, grains of gold. The sands of
these streams when washed show color,
oftentimes in paying quantities. Your corre
spondent haa witnessed the washing of stream
sands and on several occasions beach sands,
with the result that payable gold deposits have
beer, located.
Native Copper Miners.
There are copper deposits in the north
ern part of the island of Luzon, and mines
were worked there by the natives 100
years ago. Now they are operated at in
tervals by natives, Chinese and foreign
ers. The correspondent continues:
The Filipinos locate the veins containing the
ore and then proceed to build wood fires on it,
keeplnj? the fires golnfr until the heat softens
the iwk and permits the easy removal of the
ore. They make crude smelting furnaces on
the ground of etone, email In size, but effective.
They get the necessary draught by using bam
boo blowers. Copper has been found In paying
quantities In several of the principal islands
of the routhern portion of the archipelago.
ThP Visayan group is already turning out some
copper, mined by Americans and others, who
expect gome time to have mining machinery of
modern type in operation, Borne having been
ordered from the United States and Europe.
Home of the newcomers desulphurize the copper
ores by "heat roasting," or by putting them
through reverberatory furnaces constructed In
the chops of Hollo. In the treatment the ore iÂ«
crushed and rolled till very fine and Is put
into furnaces. The product is a copper matte.
People from Montana and Australia
have been locatlns silver claims on the
islands for some months.

velopment Company has been incorpor
ated to operate the Rising Star group of
mines at Plymouth. Amador County. The

There is a rumor that Mrs. Hetty Green
ha* bought the Union, copper mines at
Copperopolis.
A tract of land has been bought by E.
W. -Wllmer near Placerville for the pur
pose of manufacturing Portland cement.
The Clark mine at Brownsville, Yuba
County, is being put in shape for reopen
ing;-. The tunnel, is being deaned^put and
retlmbered:
The California mine In Nevada County
will soon resume work under the new
management. New machinery will be
put in.
A contract has been let by the Wash
ington Gold Mining Company for the con
struction of a 20-stamp mill at> the com
pany's quartz mine . at Bath, Placer
County.
Many claims have recently been located
In Siskiyou County, near the Dewey mine,
west from Gazelle.
The Shasta King copper mine will have
a smelter and the Trinity Copper Com
pany has let a contract for the construc
tion of a wagon road from Kennett to
the mine, which must be completed in a
month.
The Porto Fino mine in Tuolumne
County, near Sonora, is being unwatered,
and so is the old Salambo copper mine
near I^a Grange, preparatory to resuming
work. H. Willey of Santa Cruz has pur
chased the Olsen mine at Golden City at
Sheriff's sale and it will be worked for
copper.
The Bodie Miner-Index says:
John Black of Bishop has bought the mill at
Benton, owned by the Little Emily Company.
He also possesses as a result of the deal a par
tially developed mine which is said to con
tain paying ore in good quantities. About
1000 tons of ore is now on the dump, which
will be worked in the newly purchased mill as
soon as it Is put -in proper shape. There are
mineral ' resources in Benton district which
will some day make it a lively and prosperous
camp.
Dredging Operations.
The Modesto News says;
B. L. Barkis bt Oakdale has entered Into a
number of contracts with owners of land on
the banks of the Stanislaus River, between
Knights Ferry and Oakdale, to, dredge the
river for gold and other precious metals. The
agreement* have been filed for record in- the
office of the County Recorder. The proposition
is to dredge, extract and carry away all pre
cious metals from the river bed. The consid
erations are $1 to each and JO per cent of the
net receipts from the river bed. The .names of
the land owners with whom he has entered
into contracts are Mrs. Margaret E. Byrum,
William F-Bach. Andrew Hamm. Fred Hoff,
man and HT B. Pentland. The proposition is a
new one, but it has been the opinion of many
for a great number of years that the sands of
the river beds will pay to work If the appliances
are sufficiently large to engage In the business
on an extensive scale.

WORK DON'T HURT.
Poor Selection of Food Is the Causo
of Break-Downs.
Many m>.n, and Â¦women, too, feel that
their work Is the cause of eymptoms of
ncr\cus break-down, but work Is not the
cause, as any one can prove to their en-
tire satisfaction, by leaving: off the food
they have been trying to subsist on, and
taking: in its place food made for the ex-
preys purpose of rebuilding the brain and
nerve centers ln the body and supplying
other portions with sufficient nourishment
end keep right on with the same work
end ret well and strong.
An illustration is given in the case of
F. A- Whitely. Superintendent of the Pub-
lic Schools at Excelsior, Minn. He is
also a student and teacher of hygiene. He
says: "This spring at the beginning of the
last month of school I was very much run
down, and since my duties are quite con-
fining, I naturally ascribed my condition
to that.
"I discovered that I made the same mis-
lake that many do. . It If not work, but a
â¢lack of proper food that causes break-
down. Wife went visiting. at this time
and I concluded to get my own meals for
a time. The grocer suggested that I use
a ready cooked food known as Grape-
Nuts. I found the food delicious, requir-
ing no cooking. I simply poured milk or
cream over it and had it ln that way.
"I used Grape-Nuts for breakfast, din-
Btr and supper, and liking it so well I
â¢imply lived on it for the next three
Weeks. My work continued quite as ardu-
ous and confining as before, but 1 experi-
enced a decided rise in spirits and vitality
as well as in general health. Found I
did not tire as before and entirely lost
that worn-out feeling which seems to
take the heart out of one. ; v^-i
"I am satisfied the change was due to
my change In food, and I have been so
greatly helped and have been taught so
valuable a lesson in food as related to the
human. body that I wish to express my
appreciation in this manner." , .~K;
It will pay any brain worker to dispense
with a part of the ordinary diet and use
Grape-JCuts once or twice a day at least,
for the food is made by food experts, for
a purpose, and that purpose is to furnish
the human system with the elements, in
a concentrated form, required for re-
building ' the brain and nerve centers
throughout the body. There is no sort of
question of the truth of the statement
and value cf the food, as can be demon-
strated by any one.

LONDON, May 18.â A man who recently
succeeded in interviewing Kruger reports
he is fanatically confident the Boers will
win In the end. He is not bitter against
England, as he considers that country has
been misled. He was pathetically anxious
to know if the war in South Africa had
hastened the death of Queen Victoria. He
also declared he did not believe God would
desert his chosen people â the Boers.
When ore of Kruger's entourage sug
gested that the miracle which was -to save
the Boer cause was -somewhat overdue,
Kruger replied: "Miracle? Isn't It a mira
cle that 15,000 men are holding 250,000 at
bay?" ;â¢'_'< Â¦Â¦Â¦-.;
CAPE TOWN, May 18.â General Bindon
Blood has just concluded a successful
concerted movement against the Boers. in
Northern Transvaal. The British columns
engaged in the operations covered a wide
area of territory, routing all commandoes
that opposed them and capturing 1000
Boers . and great quantities of supplies,
stock and wagons in various districts.
They compelled the peripatetic pseudo
Transvaal government to move again.
General Blood conducted operations in the
center, with Colonel Piumer on the left
flank and General Kitcheneron the right.
The Boer commander, General Ben Vil
joen, abandoned everything, but succeeded
in making his escap* with a few mounted
men. The Boers did not make a stand at
any point.
The report from Durban that a company
with Â£7,000,000 capital has approached' the
National Government for permission â¢ to
construct a direct trunk line from Durban
to Johannesburg by, tunneling through
the hills is confirmed. If the scheme goes
through the Hand will be only twelve
hours' Journey from the coast. '
Believes the Boers Will
Eventually Win From
the British.
BERLIN, May 18.â The large 'amount of
space- and attention which the German
press and public of every class have re
cently devoted "to the United States, and
more particularly to the United States'
relations with Germany and Great Brit
ain, is remarkable. A year Â« ago It was
mainly the Agrarian press which t>ys
tematlcally antagonized the United States,
in view of the agrarian products and po
litical influence, but now the Liberal and
Radical press are slowly becoming con
vinced that the United States is their
keenest commercial and Industrial rival.
This fact came out strongly during the
Reichstag debates last month, and also in
the Diet. Naturally the Conservative and
Agrarian press stir : up this fire by every
available means. .
From various sources It is learned that
the harmonious relations between the
Emperor and the Conservatives have suf
fered severely through the last sessions
of the Diet and Reichstag, during which
the canal bill was disrespectfully spurned.
.While the party claims to have received
the Government's assistance In adopting
'pro-agrarian measures, the Emperor in
private conversation is reported to have
spoken indignantly about this disloyal
conduct of the Conservatives. It is also
significant that this week the North Ger
man Gazette Â¦ (Conservative) reprinted
without comment a severe article
from tha Wezer Zeltung of Bremen (Na
tional Liberal) on the subject. His
Majesty Ih reputed to be especially wroth
because the Conservatives failed to Intel
ligently appreciate his pro-British policy
and the reasons therefor, and Instead
joined in the rabid antl-Hritish cry.
It Is learned authoritatively that the
questions regarding the method of tnÂ«
China settlement have not yet beÂ«m agreed
upon; whether it shall consist of a single
loan, under the joint guarantee of the
powers; whether each power shall guar
antee its portion, or whether there shoil
bÂ« no loan, letting Chlnit pay off the In
demnity in ' Installments. Politically',
nothing prevents the withdrawal of the
foreign troops from China Immediately.
Their withdrawal will certainly bcÂ«In
soon, but will bo carried out Kraduailv.
Count von Waidornee will leavo within A
fortnight and, after visiting Japnn, ho will

In spite of tho Prussian Governments
prompt remonstrance, Russia continues to
maintain stringent antl-Jewlsh measures
In tho frontier districts, virtually prevent
ing all Russian Jews from missing the
Oermnn frontier and practically prohibit
ing all German Jews from crossing Into
Russia for any purpose. It Ih claimed
Itussla resolved upon such severe meus
urcR because an Investigation showed tnat
Jewish smuggler bands were responsible
for the recent socialist and nihilist fo
mentations along the frontier, and also
for the wholcnalo introduction of danger
ous pamphlets.
The Uerllnor Tajjeblatt prints an au
thorized statement from the Dresdener
Nachrichten denying that the latter paper
ever bought or negotiated for nhares of
the Paris Figaro for its own account, but
admitting that it did so for foreign cus-.
tomers, the number of shares obtained be
ing 504, which was not sufficient to gain
control of the paper.

PORT LUIS, . Mauritius, May 18.â The
total eclipse of the sun was well observed
at the . Royal Alfred Observatory. , The
partial eclipse was partly lost through a
cloud and the first contact was entirely
lost. The 'last three contacts were, well
observed.
The party included twenty-two observ
ers. Fifty-two photographs of the corona
wero obtained with the photo-heliograph
of the Mauritius Observatory, the Green
wich coronagraph, the New Begine tele
scope and smaller cameras. -Forty-one
photographs were taken of the partial
phase, ' of the diameter and place ot the
moon, and eighteen photographs were
taken of the spectrum-
Professor Claxton â¢ arranged , the meteor
ological observations over a wide area, for
evidence of eclipse cyclone. The corona
was of the expected minimum type,. but
seemed fainter, yellower, more diffuse and
less definite than in the eclipse of last
May. . .. . â¢
KARANGSAGO, Sumatra, May 18.â F.
W. Dysdon of the International Observa
tory, Greenwich, experienced unsatisfac
tory conditions to observe the eclipse of
the sun from the island of Auer Gedong.
The morning: dawned heavy with clouds,
but improved later. The sun, however,
was obscured the whole time. The dura
tion of tho eclipse was six minutes and
twenty-ono seconds. Mercury and Venus
were seen. The form of the corona was
that usually associated with the eun spot
minimum.
LICK OBSERVATORY, May 18.-A.
cablegram received from Padansr, Suma
tra, from ProfeÂ«Â»or C. D. Perrlne, In
charge of the Crocker eclipse expedition
from the Lick Observatory, states that
the Â«ky wan partially clouded at the time
of tha eclipse. The programme was con-
Blderably Interfered with, but it \n hoped
that rÂ«Â«ult* of value have bÂ«en secured,
Tho form of tho corona was similar to
that observod at the eclipses of 18!>8 and
1900 in that the equatorial extensions of
tha corona wero prominent.
Tho sky was considerably darker than
on the occasion of tho eclipse last year,
but still wan hardly do dork as was ex
pectod. Detailed results of the expedition
will bo cabled an far nÂ» potmlblo in two
or three days after tho photographic
platen have bÂ»Â»on developed. The health
of members of the expedition is very
good.

WEAKNESS
There is no such condition as weakness in a
rnan under' fifty years of age, other than gen-
eral debility. Frematureness, loss of vitality,
etc., are but symptoms of some damage to the
reproductive system caused by a contracted
disorder or early dissipation. In looking for the
location of this damage we generally find an
enlarged, swollen and inflamed prostate gland.
As this gland is the very center of the re-
productive system it can readily be understood
that inflammation of it must cause disordered
function. The cases are promptly benefited by
proper treatment, otherwise the patient I goes
from bad to worse. The essential point in all"
of them 13 the necessity of the cure of the focus
of the trouble, in the prostate. . Many men who
have unsuccessfully treated for a weakness
should now know the cause of failure. In our
experience there is no drug in the Phaima-
copea taken into the stomach, that -will even
benefit this class of cases. Our plan of treat-
ment Is entirely a local one, and prompt results
are obtained, as indicated by increased circu-
lation and return of natural vigor. Our colored
chart, which we mall on application, is inter-
esting to any one wishing "to study the anatomy
of the male.
Varicocele.
Varicocele is an enlargement of the most
vital blood vessels in man. In their normal
condition their function is to carry off waste
material,' thus enabling the organs to receive
fresh nutrition. Owing Â¦ to the breaking down
of \he valves, caused by the paralysis of the
muscular coaf of the veins, they become dilated,
and local stagnation of- the blood follows. The
vital nerves, being deprived of their proper
quality and quantity of nourishment, weakness
is the result. Statistics prove that 25 per cent
of the male population are afflicted with vari-
cocele in some stage of the disease. â¢ We guar-
antee- to cure varicocele In one week at. our
office, or four weeks of home treatment, with-
out the use of knife, caustic or ligature; We
.have cured over 2000 cases without a single
failure or unpleasant result. We invite cor-
respondence and the fullest investigation of our
method, and can refer to cured patients if

An Industrial' of Unique Strength.
The organization of the Allls-Chalmers
Company,, one of the, latest industrial
combinations, was attended with circum
stances which make it in some particulars
unique in the business world. The, com
pany starts with a'cash capital of $10,000,-
QOO, of which sum $2,500,000 will be expend
ed in the.erection of an additional plant
to double the present capacity of the Allis
works." The valuation "of the several plants
included In the consolidation, taking into
account the real estate,.buildings, machin
ery, tools, patterns, drawings and patents,
together with the cost of organizing and
getting â¢ Into full operation, Is placed by
Julian Kennedy, an expert engineer who
examined the properties, at $9,935,000. In
this estimate no allowance whatever is
made for good will. The total present
value of tangible property, therefore,, is
$19,935,000, while the total issue of pre
ferred stock against this property is only
$16,250,000. All of this stock, it is stated,
is issued for cash at par, or in lieu of cash,
for the plants at less than their valuation
as stated above. Of the total issue 'there
will be more than 61 per cent In cash and
the balance .will be in prbperty that pro 7
duces much more - than the cumulative
dividend.:to which-;the preferred stock is
entitled. The - companies taken. over by
the Allls-Chalmers. Company Include the
following builders of heavy engines, min
ing and other machinery: The Edward P.

CompanyÂ»of Scranton, Pa,, (exclusive * or

for the economies: expected from consoli
dation, it Is estimated,that the company
â¢should earn 7 per cent-on both classes of
stock in the fiscal year ending May 1, 1902.

J. R. Freud, president of the Civil Ser
vice Commission, notified Commissioner
Manson of the Board of Public Works
yesterday that his commission would not
countenance the special examination to
which the board was subjecting the three
civil service eligibles for deputyships. In
the Bureau of Streets.. The three eligibles
are John Boyle. A. McCreery and .William
Reardon, and as there is but one position
to be filled each was given certain ques
tions of* a practical nature to answer, it
being the Intention "to give, the place to
the clerk giving the -best answers. When
the Civil Service Commission heard cf this
action a special meeting was held and
Freud was delegated to. convey the ob
jections of the commission to the Boaril of
Works. -- . â¢ .- ' : ' :
I "To subject eligibles to a special exam
ination," said Freud, "is a reflection on
our commission. I desire to inform you
that if the Board of Works insists on giv
ing another test to men who have been
passed upon by the commission, we will
find it necessary to certify the name of
only one eligible â¢ instead of three, as has
been the practice in the Â¦ past. That will
necessitate . the appointment of Boyle."
- Manson saw the force of Freud's re
mark and agreed to return the papers of
the special examination to the three eligi
bles. Manson explained that there was no
intention to cast any . reflection on the
methods of the Civil Service Commission
in the issuance of its eligible list.- He said
there were only , three men in line for tho
position and the Board of Works desired
to ascertain on Its 6wn account which one
of the three was best fitted for the duties.

"DINK" WILSON TJNDEB
- ARREST IN NEW YORK
Desperate Crook Wlio Robbed. Neu
berger, Hslss & Co.'s . Store Is :
'Â¦''-. Again in Prison.
.The desperate crook who was arrested
in.NewYork last Friday and. who gave
his name as George Davis is no other than
"Dink" Wilson, the noted criminal who
operated in this city some years ago. Ac
companied by two crooks, who are known
' as C, F. Moore and Tom King, Wilson
broke^into Neuberger, Reiss & Co.'s store
at 5 o'clock in the morning and after se
lecting a number of bolts of silk valued
at several thousand dollars placed them
in an express wagon, which they had
hired for the occasion. They then drove
to'a r house on Bush street, above Stock
ton, where they were tracked by ex-Chief
Lees and several detectives and placed
under arrest. With the exception of
about two bolts, all the stolen silk was
found- in the house. Wilson managed -to
secure his freedom on straw bonds and
at once left the city. King and Moore
were convicted and sent to SanQuentin
for i three years each. â Wilson": several
months later was picked up by the police
of New York and held pending the arrival
of an officer from this city: -^After" 1 being
brought back Wilson, who. is; considered
one of the cleverest crooks in the Coun
try, pleaded guilty to stealing; the* silk
and was sent to Folsom for five years by
ex -Judge Wallace. Since : his ,- release,
about four years ago, he has been in tho
East, frequently being arrested for vari
ous crimes, but always managing to es
caDe: conviction. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦
Captain of Detectives Seymour has fur-;
nished the New. York police with the local
reccrd of Wilson, together with the names
of the men who assisted him in robbing
the store of Neuberger, Reiss & Co.
Everything in local labor circles now
depends upon the action to be taken by
the members of the unions affiliated with
the iron Trades Council. That there will
be a walk-out of machinists to-morrow
is an undisputed fact, but the number of
men that will be affected thereby is yet
unknown.
A lengthy memorial emanating from
the San Francisco Labor Council: has
been presented to President McKinley.
It ascribes tho present differences be
tween employers and employes to the
possibility of Congress not taking Â¦ any
action in reference to the further con
tinuance of the exclusion laws now in
force. The policy of territorial expansion
is combat ted and the. request is made
that with the acquisition of outlying
lands, the doctrine' of exclusion be en
forced. Â¦ . ' Â¦ Â¦ -
Tho Labor Council has also issued a
second statement relating to the proposed
arbitration scheme. While it 'admits in
this statement that the labor millenium
has not yet arrived, it says that through
conciliatory measures and. general dis
cussions much ', may be accomplished. The
plan of the proposed convention is thus
explained: . ' â¢ â¢: . ; â¢ . : [Â¦
The Labor Council at Its meeting F.riday
night instructed the executive committee to
call a convention composed of two members
from each affiliated union 'and invite mer
chants, manufacturers and other publicj-splrlted
citizens to come and discuss ! matters now In
dispute. ,The committee was. also Instructed. to
interest some leading citizen, to issue the call
and open the convention. The scope of the con
vention is not to settle existing labor disputes,
but to bring about a .better, understanding ba
tween employer and employe. The incentive to
the calling of this convention was . given bj
the recent convention held at New York, where
leading business men, prominent divines and
representatives of < organized' labor met and
brought employer and , employe nearer .to
gether. â¢ : ' . ' ' -
A number of men prominent in â¢. social,
political and religious life have been sug
gested, but none seems 'willing 'to 'follow
the action taken in New .York. .
Boiler-Makers'. Helpers' Demands.
The executive of j the , Boiler
makers' and Iron Shipbuilders' | Helpers'
Union, a part of the iron building' trades!
has submitted the following schedule ! of
proposed wages in sympathy with the'ac
tion taken by the machinists, from; whom
they receive their support: - < . Â¦ '

arid the session was prolonged until the
early hours of the morning. A few sur
prises resulted from the election.
In the contest for grand worthy presi
dent Dr.- J. B. Schwatka was expected to
carry off the honor, but the friends of Del
Cary, Smith of .Spokane, Wash;, rallied
around ' his standard, at the last moment
and succeeded in winning the fight. Al
though the selection of . Smith was a sur
prise, Dr. Schwatka took his \ defeat In
good. grace and moved that the choice be
made unanimous. His motion waa car-,
rled with acclamation. Almost immedi
ately afterward Dr. Schwatka was elected
grand â¢ worthy vice â¢ president without a
dissenting vote. Â¦ -' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦

tion In Mission Masonic Hall last night
in celebration of the clearing: up of all Its
Indebtedness. It was a banquet served to
370 of the 580 members and four specially

in the loclgerdbra. and the menu was a
model of original wit.
. After the supper and'Xlgrars, Past Mas
ter James A. VHson, toastmaster, read a
witty burial service of the mortgage,
which was then consigned to the flames
by "Chief Burner" H. C. Somers, presi
dent of the board of directors of the Hall
Association. J. "W. Keyston gave- a his
torical review of the work of the board,
which showed that . the lodge was insti
tuted in September, 1863; that in April,
1897, the corner-stone of the Mission Ma
sonic Temple was laid, at which time a
mortgage of $16,000 was placed on the
property; that the building was dedicated
in December,. 1897, and the debt canceled
last February.
J. --P. '. Hogdon, vice president of the
board, responded to "Our Co-laborers,"
and then there were short addresses by
H. C. Bunker, the secretary; Andrew
Christensen, Charles F. Libby, worshipful
master of the lodge, and I. J. Truman.

PRESIDENT McKINLEY has
been, royally received in many
places and in. many ways, but
he has never been given such
a genuine, heartfelt welcome
as that which greeted him at the Union
Iron Works yesterday morning as he
stepped from the Sloeum onto the
wharf. , %
The tug came down the bay with all
her flags flying, the cheers from passing
vessels being drowned in the thunder
ous salute belching from the warships
lying off the works, and drew up at
the wharf at the foot of the drydock of
the shipyard. Down the center of the
drydock had been run a planked way,
clean and canvas covered, and at the
further end the workmen had been gath
ered with their ladies in a crowd of four
or five thousand. - The President was
met on the wharf "by a committee from
the workmen, and, escorted by the com
mitteemen, the President. Irving Scott,
Henry T. Scott, the members of the
Presidential party and their ladies and
a number of invited guests walked down
the length of the drydock to the wharf
at the further end. .'-Â¦
/. It was while standing at the edee of
tlie wharf and looking down into the
drydock that the presentation of the
workmen's Votivenic.piatG was -. made.
CHEERING LONG CONTINUED.
The plate was an . invitation to the
launch of the Ohio. , It was made of
solid gold and was beautifully. engraved
with the arms of California and Ohio,
and a picture of the Ohio as she will ap

MORE CHEERS FOR; McKINLEY.
There was great cheering when Fitz
patrick handed the gold plate to the
President, and there was more when the
President turned to the men to speak
to them, and there was still more as he
proceeded, for he touched vthe heart
strings of his listeners and moved them
with a story of patriotism and of well
earned glory. He referred to the CaK
fornia Volunteers as the first to go out
into the Philippines and amonjj the last
to come back. He told of his knowl
edge of their service and their work
and his appreciation of it. He spoke,
too, of the Oregon and her wild race to
be in time for the fight; of the days
of anxious waiting as she drove alonir
through wini and wave, alone and fear
less, and then of the weight-lifted from
the hearts of those who had been watch
ing for her when he received^ the jjal
lant Clarke's telegram saying,' "We are
here and ready."
There was wild enthusiasm amonar
the workmen when the race of the Ore
gon was brought back to them by the
President's words. She was ready to
fight, and ready, too, after a heart
breaking run of 15,000 miles. Many of
the men who listened to the President
had worked on the creat steel hull of
the stanch old vessel, and they love her
as their own child. The tears came to
their eyes and their iips trembled as
they cheered, and the members of the
President's party joined them in their
emotion, for McKinlcy was speaking as
he had not spoken at any place on his
tour. And then when he declared that
the glorious record of the srrand- old
battleship was due. to the men who put
their best skill and labor into her plates
and engines, their enthusiasm knew no
bounds.
McKIlTLEY SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY

those last supreme moments. A hitch.

or shoreward, and toppling on the nar

THE LAST MOMENTS.
Suddenly the clink of hammer on
steel resounded from below the big hull
and from every side. The word had
been given to get ready and the men
were knocking away every second block
upon which she had been resting so as
to ease her down upon the cradle that
was to carry her down the ways. With
maul and wedge they hacked and tore
at the heavy blocks and shredded them
out from under the weight that was
pressing upon them, and painters fol
lowed the men with hammers and
daubed the flaming red that already
covered her plates over the places
where the blocks Had held her. And as
she settled down into the- cradle -the,
timbers creaked and squealed, and the
grease that smeared the ways oozed out
in long strings and spattered over the
wharf. Â«
The shipyard was in silence. Nune
of the shops were running and there
was nothing to take the attention of the
hundred men who, under James Dickie,
the master shipcarpentcr. were to start
the vessel seaward.

lighted children. The stand was draped
in the colors of the flag, and silken ban
ners fluttered from every corner and
along the railing. It was an hour and
a half before the launch that the crowd
assembled, and the people looked and
questioned and wondered and patted the
steel prow of the huge vessel and watch
ed the rising of the tide.

the occasion,' had aboard it probably the
most distinguished company that has ever
gathered -on the decks of any vessel on

visited.
. Jolly Crowd on Annie.
' The tug Annie ' carried a Jolly party,
guests of W. H. Healy and James A..MC-
Mahon. - Captain Tictiworth was in com
mand. A plentiful supply of refreshments
was aboard and guests aboard craft lying
near the Annie were invited on the
tag to share v the good things. On the re
turn the Annie had an excltlns race with
the tug Lottie, Captain Uxman, and won
after . a hair-raising finish that was wit
nessed by thousands of excursionists.
The General McDowell carried a load of
officers of the regular army and their
families and friends. The excursion was
arranged by Captain Plummer of Major
General Shatter's staff. BfB
â¢ The San Pablo, the Ukiah. the Sausa

.The Piper-Aden-Goodall Company gave
quite a number of their friends a very
pleasant view of the- launch from "the.
decks of the Sunol. The captain took the
steamer on the Â«Â«ter side of the warships,
giving the party an exceptionally good,
view of all the gayly decorated men-of

little before 12 o'clock he turned and took
a position off the iron works close to the
President's tug Slocum.

From this point all the guests had a flna ,
view of the launching, and were able to
be among the first to get away after the
battleship had left the ways. They then
steamed slowly up the bay among the re
turning fleet, giving the party a chance
to partake of light refreshments and lis

Captain Leale had some 200 guests
aboard the Caroline, among them being

THE broad bay of San Francisco
has seldom had afloat upon its
bosom so many gorgeously dec
orated craft carrying so many
i.bui hearted, expectant people
as on yesterday. Every vessel
available carried either excursionists or
private oartles and all paths led to the
Union Iron Works, from whose shipyard
the majestic Ohio was to make its bow
and slip unostentatiously into the waters
of the bay. .''â¢ . Â¦.;
From early morning the water front af
forded a scene of more than the usual
bustling activity and there was a holiday
appearance noticeable all along the
wharves. Excursion boats, side-wheelers
and stern-wheelers, river craft and bay
craft, tugs, yachts and launches came
out in all the glory of radiant flags, and
as they lay at anchor waiting for their
loads of pleasure seekers they were pro
phetic of a day which should not be
marred by disappointments, or ill winds,
or threatening skies. The ferry-boats were
crowded throughout the morning, each
with its load of people from, across the
bay hurrying 1 to catch excursion craft or

McKinley Arrives at the Wharf.
Suddenly a shout arose and was taken
Â«p along the wharf, and men, women and
Children scampered toward the street as
the President's carriage came clattering
along over the cobble stones. The com
ing was so hurried and quiet and unex
pected that the distinguished guest was
inside the gates of the transport wharf
before a crowd of any considerable size
had time to collect.
President McKinley was received at the
entrance to the wharf by Colonel Long,
Captain Batchelder and Captain Barneson
of the transiwrt service.
A few moments later those along the
wharves and aboard the vessels lying
near were rewarded for their patience by
a sight of the President as he appeared
on the upper deck of the Slocum, bowing
to the members of the distinguished party
on board, and with Mayor Phelan at his
Fide.
Salvos of cheers arose from every side
and President McKinley acknowledged the
greetings with uncovered head, bowing re
peatedly â¢ ia the direction of swarms of

That you might take back to your distant people a slight re
minder of the ship you will launch, - it has been ' thought well
that yon carry back with yon this painting of the great ship
Ohio, which I take pleasure in presenting to you on behalf of the
San Francisco Call. It is the work: of our' marine artist, Mr. W.
A. Coulter. He was a sailor, and in that life of hardy adventure
-which he followed wherever on the globe there was Water
enough to float a ship and -wind enough to fill her sails, he ac
quired that knowledge of marine architecture and of rig, and of
the moods of wave and weather, which puts the charm into his
painting of ship and sea and sky.
Your State -was once a frontier. Where you are now is to be
always a frontier. Here the greatest continent and the great
est ocean meet. Man changes the condition of the land; tames
and tills it. He plants forests -where none grew before, and de
stroys those which nature planted; so that, as the ages roll by,
the primitive and natural Is displaced by the artificial. But not
Â¦o the ocean. Xo hand restrains Its tide. Its great currents flow
unchecked and the tempests rage themselves to exhaustion; and
man is helpless while they are abroad upon the waters. To those -
â¢who live by the sea and those never reached by Its ever-sound
ing voice, its mystery and romance are everlasting.
California has keenly enjoyed the presence of Ohio's Presi
dent of the United States, her Governor and her Congressmen,
and the representatives of her press, to attend the launching of
a great ship.

DESCRIPTION
OF THE LATEST
NAVAL TERROR
Ohio Will Be One of the
Most Formidable En
gines of Destruction
in ths World's Navies
THE Ohio is a sister ship of, the
Maine, now building at the works
of the William Cramo & Sons
Ship and Engine Building Com
pany, and of the Missouri, build
ing at the yard of the Newport
News Ship Building and Dry Dock Com
pany.
The hull, whichis divided like those of
the most recent battleships,- la built of
steel and is unsheathed. It Is SS8 feet long
on the load-water line, 72 feet 2%' inches
extreme breadth and, at a meaTv draft of
23 feet 6 Inches, displaces 12,230 tons.
The hull is protected abreast of the boil
ers and engines by a side arnior'belt ex
tending. 3 feet 6 inches above the load
water line and 4. feet below it, ..avinz a
thickness of 11 inches for a depth of 4 feet
6 inches, tapering to t*Â£ inches at the bot
tom of the belt, and by the casemate
armor C inches thick, which extends from
the side belt to the upper deck and Us
worked from the center of the forward to 1
the center o* the after barbette. At the
ends of this casemate armor diagonal
armor.' 9 inches thick extends from the
sides of the vessel to the -barbette armor.
In the casemate thus formed are placed
ten of the 6-inch guns. Above this^ori the
upper deck, four of the 6-inch â¢ runs- are
placed, in the vicinity of which '" 6-inch
armor Is worked far enough forward and
aft to afford protection to the crews of
these guns. â¢ '
Vitals Amply Protected./
Protection is afforded the vita's of the
ship below the water line by a protective
deck worked flat within the casemate, and
,wlth slopes forward and, aft of it. The
deck is worked in two thicknesses of plat
ing, the totar thickness on the flat being
2% inches, while that on the KloDes for
ward and aft is respectively 3 Inches and 4
inches. Cofferdams are built on the rro
tective deck from the Â¦ [diagonal armor
bulkheads to the bow and stern in the
vicinity | of the water line, and on the
berth deck for, nearly the. length of the
vessel. All of these cofferdams > are filled
with corn-pith callulose.
The main battery of the ship consists
of four 12-inch breech-loading rifles,
placed in two balanced turrets, and six
teen 6-lnch rapid-firing guns.
h . The turrets are turned by electricity,
and. the motors used for this purpose can
revolve one of these great turrets through
360 degrees. in one minute. The armor of
both the turrets and barbettes "is 12 inches
thick. . Â¦
Ten of the 6-lnch guns are- within' the
, casemate, ; as before stated; two others
are on the berth deck ; forward in 6-inch
armored sponsons, \ and four are on the
upper deck." Those In ' the â¢ sponsons for
ward and two on the. upper deck can fire
grounds and be worried with fewer hours
of travel, they have selected a nearer ve
sort. The Vermonters- have prepared an
unusually interesting programme for the
day and many prizes will be given to the
successful competitors in the sames and
to fortunate holders of gate prize tickets.
There are two military moats fitted -with
the usual signal yards, tops and topmasts;
two tops are built to each of these masts.
The foremost is located in the usual way
over the Â¦ forward [ conning * tower, tha
foundation of the tower forming th9 lower

morning and turned her prow
tov.-ard the scene of the launching. The
ti3;Â» n-a? black with people and efferves

the President of the United States was
there, bowing; and greeting; in his gracious

Salutes Soldiers on Sheridan.
Htiaight toward the southern portion of
the bay steamed the S'.ccua. but only for
a few moments. Suddenly a churning of
the fait water told the line of followers
thst tfce President had changed his
courre. The Slocum. instead of going
straight toward the Union Iron Works,
veered toward a Ion?, soldier-packed ship
at avchor midstream between the city
v-hp.rves and Goat bland. It was the
Transport Sheridan at anchor after many
a ir.fle- of ocean travel, and crowding deck,
and raii vre.e the war-worn soldiers of the
Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth Infantry regi
ments.
â¢What is that ship riding at anchor on
our ?eft?" said President McKinley to a
member cf the Cabinet as the Slocum
â¢was speeding southward. The statesman
addressed gazed at the ship, but before
he had time to venture an answer the
Pr--*1der.t received complete information
frcia one ameng these present that the
Ehfp in question was the transport *3heri
dan. just returned from the Philippines
and leaded with soldiers.
"I w:sh to welcome them to their na
tive land," said the President. In a mo
ment the Slocum had changed her course,
cutting through the tempered swell to
ward the transport. The boys in blue
and brass buttons were lined up to cheer
President McKinley as he passed in the
distance. They did not think that he
would change his course to wave his silk
hat in welcome to their home-coming and
they were surprised and delighted when
they saw the Slocum's prow mounting
the waves and scudding along toward
thefr own ship. From afar they realized
the intent x)f the Slocum party and cheer
after cheer rolled over the water from
the ship that had listed to starboard by
the sudden concentration of the soldiers
on the city side. The enthusiasm was un
bounded and from the throats of the men
â¢who had fought in the jungles of far
away Luzon came as lusty and spon
taneous a cheer as ever rose from the
ranks of triumphant soldiers.
An Inspiring Scene.
v President McKinley bowed, his head
uncovered. His features took on a seri
ous thoughtful expression. His mind was
evidently far away, his thought with the
boys who fought and bled for the stars
and stripes. Then he looked upward and
so close was he to the transport that the
returning soldiers could see the play of
emotional thought on his features. An
other lusty shout went upward. At this
time the Slocum passed around the Sheri
dan on the north end. From west to
east the transport listed as the noise of
cheering moved from starboard to port.
Inspiring was the scene and deeply
touching it was to the President As the
Elocuin rounded the Sheridan and again
headed for the scene of the launching
President McKinley wheeled around and
cast a wistful look backward. The si
lence was unbroken after that for several
minutes.
Then the Slocum rushed Into the sput
tering fire of the salute from the men-of
war and President and all turned toward
the business of the day.
Will Not Pay Jurors.
Attorney Louis Boardman presented a
demand for $18 yesterday to Auditor "Wells
which was made out in favor of J. R. Pow
ell, being for services rendered as a trial
juror some time ago. "Wells holds, as in
the case of the Panhandle Appraisers, that
the bills of one year cannot be paid out of
another year's funds. Boardman expected
that the Auditor would not sign the de
mand, and be will take the matter to
court to determine the validity of tne law
passed by the Legislature providing for
t he compensation of Jurors. There Is seme

THE guests who werÂ© invited
aboard the superb revenue cut
ter Golden Gate were afforded a
fine view of the launch of the
battleship Ohio.
F. S. Stratton, Collector of thÂ©
Port; E. B. Jerome, deputy col
lector: VT. B. Hamilton, cashier of the
Custom-house, and Captain Cushing. com
mander of the speedy craft, entertained
their visitors in a style highly creditable
to their sense of true hospitality. As fore
shadowed by the- press, thÂ© cream of Oak
land's refined society was largely repre
sented In the company aboard the Golden
Gate. It was noted by impartial observ
ers that this incident added delight to thÂ©
occasion and contributed intellectual pres
tige to the event.
,ThÂ© cutter left her station at pier No. 3.
Â¦Washington-street wharf, a few minutes
after 10, going directly to the Union Iron
"Works, In advance of the Slocum. A po
sition was taken which gave Captain
Cushing's passengers, of whom many
were Oakland ladles, a fine view of the
saluting squadron when the battleships
Iowa and "Wisconsin and the cruiser Phil
adelphia paid their compliments to John
jD. Long, Secretary of the Navy. Another
picturesque View was obtained when the
warships, joined in thÂ© meantime by thÂ©
McCulloch, fired a salute of twenty-one
guns in honor of the President of the
Unlted < States.
A battleship presents an air of bravÂ©
beauty when ter turrets and masts arÂ©
wreathed with the smoke of powder, and
a view of the scene from a point* a few
hundred feet distant Is Inspiring. .One of
thÂ© points of inspiration yesterday was
the deck of the Golden Gate when the
Wisconsin, Iowa. Philadelphia and Mc-
Culloch were saluting.
The revenue cutter took a position at
the Union Iron Works wharf, immediately
astern of the Slocum. The army boat
General McPhers,on. with many ladles, of
ficers and veterans aboard, came along
side the Golden Gate. Later on the Har
bor Commissioners' boat, the Governor
Markham. wedged in to give the Gov
ernor's staff a glimpse of the President.

forward bilge keels extend for a length of
about eighty-seven feet, while those aft
haya a. length of about seventy-five feet.
Hydraulic gear is used In steering thÂ©
vessel, and can put the rudder from hard
aport to hard astarboard in twenty sec
Â¦ onds when the vessel is moving at full
speed. The valves of the gear arÂ© con
nected -by an electric teleinotor with the
conning tower, besides the mechanical
connection with the pilot-house.
ThÂ© electricity, both for lighting thÂ©
-vessel and operating the turrets and hoists
and minor purposes, is furnished by eight
32-klIowatt generating sets, all having a
pressure of eighty volts at thÂ© terminals.
There are four dynamo-rooms, one on
each side of the vessel just forward of the
boiler space, two generating sets being
placed In each dynamo-room. Eour pow
erful searchlights, two of which are placed
on the top of the pilot-house and two on
the mainmast above the upper bridge, will
give warning of the approach of hostile
vessels, and for night signaling the ship
carries two sets of electric signaling ap-_
paratus.
The normal coal supply is 1000 tons, and
the capacity of the bunkers is 2000 tons.
As in other ships of this typÂ©, the ar
rangements of the bunkers is such as to
afford considerable Incidental protection
to the machinery .
The Ohio and her class are the first bat-
tleships of the "United States navy in
which water tube boilers were provided.
Steam for the propelling: machinery Is
supplied by water tube boilers of the
Thorycroft type placed In four water
tight compartments. There are three
smokeplpe3.
The two propelling engines are rights
and lefts in separate Â¦water-tight com
partments and are of the vertical Jnvert
ed-eylinder, direct-acting, triple-expan
sion type, having four cylinders. The
diameters of the cylinders are as follows:
3S5 Inches H. P., 53 inches I. P. and 63
inches for two low pressures by 48 inches
stroke.
: -~ 'Has High Bate of Speed.
Â¦ The collective L H. P. of the main en
gines with their air and circulating is
about 10,000 when the vessel is making
a speed of eighteen knots. It should bÂ©
stated here that the Ohio ranks next to
the Georgia class of battleships in our
navy in regard to speed. The Georgia
and class, which will have the greatest
speed of any battleship yet authorized
by Congress, are designed to make rine
teen knots.
A refrigerating room on the berth deck
forward furnishes cold storage, and the
ship is supplied with an ice machine of the
dense air tpye that can produce the cool
ing effect of two tons of ice per day.
Only such wood material as was deemed
absolutely necessary is used in the con
struction of the vessel, and all of chia, ex
cept the armor backing, Is thorough fire
proof.
The windlass, which Is of the most mod
ern pattern, is operated by steam, and can
raise both the bower anchors at once. It
is housed in an enclosure just forward of
the forward barbette.
There, are four steam winches used for
hoisting coal and general deck purposes.
*The construction of the Ohio and her
class was authorized by Congress on Hay
4, 1S93, when the Spanish war demonstrat
ed the wisdom of a much greater increase
of the navy. The keel was laid on April
22, 1899, and the contract price of hull an<l
machinery is $C.S39,000.

launching, they went on a cruise around
the bay. Those who wanted to land had
to bow to the will of the majority and In
consequence there was much grumbling.
- The steamer Resolute of the Piper- Aaen-
Goodall fleet carried off the palm for the'
best dressed vessel at the launching.
Great care and ingenuity had been ex
pended on her decorations and she pre
sented a beautiful appearance as she

Works.
J. C. Wilson was a host afloat yesterday.
He entertained seventy guests from the
Bohemia and Pacific-Union clubs aboard ,

The Sausalito returned to her berth at
1:15 p. m., and then the trouble really
broke out. The passengers refused to
leave the boat unless their money was
refunded. James H. Creely, the attorney,
was their spokesman and he refused to
leave until an understanding was arrived
at. ' After half an hour spent In arguing
Captain Tribble sent for the police, but
Captain Dunleavy said there . was no
breach of the peace and refused to Inter
fere. Shortly afterward the Sausalito had
to back Into the stream to allow the San
Rafael - to dock. While steaming around
an agreement was reached. The passen
gew were willing to forego their claim If
the company would take them back to the
Union Iron Works and give them" a look
at the Ohio as she lay off the Arctic Oil
Works/ Captain Tribble agreed to the ar
ranstment and headed his boat for the
scene of the morning's launching. After
everybody aboard had had a good look at
the warship tha Sausalito went back to
her slip and the passengers walked
ashore.
Â¦ There was considerable trouble on the
ferry steamer Sausallto and at one time
It looked as though there was going to
be a deadlock. The steamer started for
the launching about 11 a. m., but owing
to the crush a good place from which to
view the- ceremony could not be found.
The first Information the- passengers had
that the Ohio had taken her initial plunge
Into the waters of the bay was the shriek
ing of the whistles. Then they got mad
and began to call President J. B. Stetson

President concluded, and then he was led
through the crowd, shaking hands as he
went, and to/ the launching stand under

His buskined feet touched light the
troubled deep;
sword;
Then firmly thou'lt scourge, with thy
thundrous Might,
The foe with the help of the Lord-
Wilt win with the help of the Lord."
Let Mercy stride free o'er the deck, ;
And Love- from the bridge draw the
PERORATION.
Plunge out in thy baptismal fount
O ship of the magical name;
Ride firm o'er the wave in thy pioneer
way,
As men in the highway of fame â
Our men in the highway of fame.
If, like a proud seagull, thy fate
To ride on the billows away.
Over fathomless depths where the sea
monsters mate.
And fight o'er the flotsam of prey
From lost vessels, the flotsam of prey â
The guerdon that hangs round thy name â
And the sons of our bountiful soil
Shall smite thy proud turrets with ran
corous flame,
If thou dost e'er shame her with spoil â
Dost shame her with ill-gotten spoil.
Sail out on the high seas of state,
If foul blows the south wind or fair;
With, homes to protect and the nation
defend,
Our sons and our ship will be there-
Brave as Perry, our ship will be there.
May the lust of the nation be lost
In life's tide, where the deep sounding3
are; -
Then, Captain, fear not, with our ensign
on high,
To follow the pale of His starâ
With cannon to follow His star. . Â¦
They'll sigh when the ship heaves away.
Erect in her great wooden stall.
She yearns for her kingdom, the sea;
The Spirit Ohio shall sever her chains,
And bid the fair captive go free;
To cut the brocade of the deep,
To walk by the feel of the land.
As love fondly lingers round sleep.
So Faith puts her seal on her hand.

on two or three sandbars, collided with

ACADEMIC TOURNAMENT
DOWN" TO THE FINALS
Mocorito, an Syto 1 shot, piloted by
Alexander, furnished the surprise in the

sessed her old-time speed, and running
<-ver her field through the stretch beat
Novia, a. rank outsider, four open lengths.

After the race was over it could plainly
be seen that Illilouon was pounds the
best of the starters in the mile and fifty
yards selling* affair. Ridden by Ransch,
ihe. gelding was knocked out of the run
inng at the first turn, and then tramping
around his company turned up an easy

two-year-old event at Oakland
yesterday. A quartet of very evenly
matched ones lined up, and it was by far
ihe sharpest betting affair on the menu.
At post time the market favored The
Giver and Divina, each being quoted at
9 to 5. Louwelsea's stock dropped until
the ticker marked \\<z, and Achilles was
slow at a half-point lower. From the
start Achilles and Divina were outfooted.

The Giver would win. but the Emperor of
Norfolk's daughter staid gamely, and as
the pair crossed the line the judges were
unable to separate them, declaring a dead
heat. Achilles. Jn another hard drive four
lengths back, Just landed the show by a

Further than this nothing out or the
ordinary groove of things characterized
the sport, which was clean and exhilarat

won starting as favorites in the betting,
but the defeat in the last event of Horton
by Goldone was a distressing accident for
the talent. Ruiz and Bassinger each dis
played splendid form in the saddle. Jake
Jloltman's fine starting also came in lor
general commendation.
Highly touted, as usual, by the end stall
delegation. Searchlight came out an S to

sprint. The good thing blew up early, and
in a drive Ruiz put feaiil of Tarsus over

healthy, but in his three of four times out
has shown more than fair speed. \ Seven

B- : RIGADIER GENERAL. FRED
ERICK M. GRANT arrived yes
terday from Manila on the Sheri-
dan, after two years' service in
the Philippines. In the Palace Ho-
toi "corridor; yesterday, jj with .' his j military
cloak' thrown, over' his. 'shoulder and a
rough campaign ' hat on â¢ his head, he
looked. the image' of his fatherâ a soldier
from head to foot. . He is home on a short
LITTLE SISTER IS THE CHOICE, THE TALENT
FIGURING THAT McCOMB'S COURSER WILL WIN
and look up to him with admiration. He
is credited with never having ordered a
regiment' or "detachment of his division
. during the Philippine campaign on a haz
.irdous Journey without himself riding -at
tho head of his ., troops. - 3 -
"Yes, I am glad to get back," said he
yesterday. "I think that the Philippine
Islands are valuable possessions. I -was
never sick there a'day, and but few men
Â¦ of my command contracted any illness."
" "What do you think of Aguinaldo?" was
asked. ' - â¢* ':' Â¦ <'
"I think that Agoiinaldo is a dead one."
he replied, "although his capture awak
'enod a. fresh interest in him among the
natives. They/ had begun to forget him.
and lose faith In his prowess. Now that
ho is captured I think that he should be
heavily lined for his treason to this coun
try and then released. He cannot do any
more harm."
â¢ Captain Charles Fenton, who has been
General Grant's aid for several years,
serving with him in the Cuban campaign,
is also here. Ho has many thrilling
stories to tell of the severe service the
troops went through in the Philippines.
Brigadier General" John C. Bates also
arrived on the Sheridan and is at tho Pal
ace. He ?returns' to America to assume
charge of tho Department of the Missouri.
During the early part of the campaign
ho was severely criticized for signing a
treaty with the Sultan of Sulu. General
Bates decided that a treaty should be so
cured at any price. His action in tho
matter was exploited at great length in
â¢the newspapers and General Bates was
criticized. He claimed, however, that the
natives had many customs that would'be
hard to break up at that/ time without
i bloodshed. His policy was- practically in
dorsed by the administration.
General Ludlow, who was also granted
leave of absence and who was expected
. on the transport,' did not arrive. He will
probably come in on the next transport.
Generals Grant and Bates were enter
, tainedat.a dinner at the Bohemian Club
by Colopel George Stone last night. The
two officers will have an audience with
President McKinley to-day.

TIGERS DEFEAT COLTTBOIA.
NEW YORK. May 18.â The athletes ot
Princeton and Columbia universities met
tb-day at the annual dual track and field
games at Columbia oval and the TIgera
won, scoring 64% points against SJtya for
Columbia. In the hammer throw De "Witt
of Princeton sent the missile a distance
of 136 feet 6 Inches. This beats the Inter
collegiate record of 154 feet 4VÂ« Inches, held
by Plaw of California, but does not coma
near the collegiate record of 163 feet %
inch, which is also held by Plaw of Cal
ifornia. As the Californian Is not entered
for the inter-collesriate games which are
to take place on Friday and Saturday of
next week it looks now as if Do Witt
had this event at his mercy.

In a ten Inning game yesterday the Sen
ators for the third J consecutive time
brought the bitterness of defeat home. to
the local aggregation. The score was â¢ 2
to'L. For seven long Innings Hanxmen
maintained a lead of one run, secured in
the third : inning, over the . visitors. Not
once had the Sacramentos been permitted
to cross. the plate on the. homeward jour-:
ney, and the fans commenced to think
that Uncle's heart would be gladdened by
a shut out. But the fatal . eighth Inning
blasted all their hopes. : . .
McLaughlln- started the trouble by. a hit
out into the left garden and stole second
by a very narrow margin. â¢ ' He was ad
vanced to third | on a sacrifice hit to . the
pitcher by Courtney and was brought
home on Doyle's , speedy drive toward
short stop, which Evans attempted to
gather in but failed. In the ninth both
sides went out in one-two-three order. In
their part of the tenth. Inning , the local
men were unable to get past the first bag;
, When the Senators came to the bat in
the tenth Evans, who had been pitching
effective ball up to that - time, slowed
down and allowed J>evereaux to walk to
first. Through a sacrifice hit by McLaugh
lin Dovereaux reached secondhand Court
ney, who followed, was given first on call
ed balls. Doyle ended the agony of the
fans and added another game to the credit,
of the Senators by. driving a beautiful
base hit to left field and Devereaux came
In. The score:

One of the most enjoyable social and
fraternal events which has ever occurred
in Monterey County -was the recent visit
of Salinas Lodge, No. 614, B. P. O. Elks,
to Brother Elk- Charles T. Romie, at his
delightful resort, Paralso Springs. On
Saturday, May 14, nearly. the entire mem
bership of the local lodge and a number
of visiting brothers,' accompanied by Row
ling's orchestra, took tho train for Sole
dad. At thl3 point they were met with
carriages and conducted to the Carlsbad
of America, Upon their arrival they were
cordially greeted by host Romie, who,
with his manager. Brother J. .O. Valpey,
devoted the remainder of thÂ© day to show
ing the visitors the. beauties of tho place
and in every possible manner contributing
to their comfort and pleasure.
The festivities were formally opened on
Saturday evening by a grand ball at "the
pavilion. The music was furnished by the
visitors' orchestra: A large number of
ladles accompanied thÂ© visiting Elks, and
the dancing . floor was crowded with gay
dancers and merry-makers until a late
hour. Sunday morning found the antlered
crowd In good splrita and with appetites
which madÂ© welcome the. barbecue which,
was scheduled for high noon. At this
function Brother Romio acted as chef and
general manager, and his â¢ reputation in
this role is so well established by the hun
dreds of . past barbecues over which he
has presided that its entire success was
far from being a surprise. The menu con
sisted of barbecued calf, frljoles, chile con
came, salsa, tamales and Salinas burro.
Â¦Full justice was done to the generous
spread and the afternoon Â¦ was spent in
viewing Â¦ and admiring the beautiful
grounds, climbing Mussel Peak, sampling
the hot water, visiting among themselves
and getting up an appetite for the bulls
head dinner at 6:80 p. m. The necessary
heads had been abundantly supplied by
Brothers Sam Matthews and H. E. Ab
bott, and again the genial proprietor of
the "Hidden Paradise" superintended,
their preparation for human consumption.
After the last head had been stripped
toasts were fittingly responded to by
Brothers B. V. Sargent, J. J. Hebbron and
'others. Brother Hebbron was the last
speaker. He responded to the toast, "Our
Host," spoke feelingly of Brother Romie's
genial hospitality and genuine good fel
lowship and asked all to join in a bumper
to his long life and prosperity.
The boys ascertained that thÂ© train
which was to return them to Salinas
would pass through* Soledad about 6
o'clock on Monday- morning and unani
mously declared that it was not worth
wbile to go to bed and they would sit up
and wait for it. The evening was prob
ably the liveliest that the springs ever
saw. Some of the visitors invented a war
cry of a peculiarly terrifying nature,-and
many of the brothers put in the night
practicing it. It was heard at Soledad.
The 6 o clock train on Monday morning
brought homo a tired and well-pleased
crowd.

WASHINGTON, May 18.â The papers
just received at the British Foreign Of
fice In reference to an isthmian canal
treaty are those forwarded - by Lord
Pauncefote about ten days ago. In au
thoritative quarters it i3 stated that these
consist mainly of a memorandum In
which Secretary Hay indicates on what
lines these should be drawn in order to
meet the views of the United States Sen
ators with whom he has conferred. This
concurs with the London view that the
paper covers the draft of proposals for a
treaty rather than a treaty Itself, for the
written memorandum is regarded as
chiefly tentative. With this paper before
them the British officials can readily per
ceive within what lines it will be neces
sary to frame a treaty in order to secure
its ratification by the . Senate.
LONDON. May 18.-The draft of Secre
tary Hay's proposals for a new Nicara
gua treaty were received from Lord
Pauncefote by tho last mail. It la a
voluminous document and Is being print
ed previous to examination and discus
sion. It is described as a redraft of the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty with what ap
pears from a casual perusal to be exten
sive annotations. Several weeks are like
ly to elapse before the Cabinet can com
mence its preliminary discussions. The
dispatches relative to tho possibility of
tho substitution of the Panama Isthmian
route are read with IntercstJn Downing
Etreet. â¢ It is said that agents of the Pan
ama Company have not approached the
Hritlsh Government, but if the United
States should think it advisable to com
plete the Panama Canal tho decision
would be hailed with no little satisfaction
at the Foreign Ofllce as being an easy
way out of the present controversy. How
ever, the British officials are without any
accurate knowledge of the terms offered
by the Panama people and they incline to
the belief that iihancial and other differ
ences will probably prevent the United
States from adopting this solution of the
affair.

sfz^ AKLAND, May 18.-Harvey W.
fT Rice, the Haywards pioneer,
(L^ . whose invention of the straw
â¢}^^^ burning thfreaher engines revolu
tionized grain handling In Califor
nia, passed away yesterday at his Hay
wards residence after many months of
illness.
Â¦ In 1852 Mr. Rice went to the site of
Haywards, following closely upon William
Hayward, the founder of the town. Then
it was a portion of the great Spanish Cas
tro grant, that extended* from the hills to
the bay and over 'Which roamed great
herds of cattle, the property of the early
Spanish-Calif ornlans.
Education was a hobby of the deceased
pioneer, and he gave many years of ef
fort to the upbuilding of the public school
estimate. But that it should the evidence
leaves me no room for doubt.
Alvarado Plant to Be Considered.
It is shown that the property was acquired
to supply, and was and is used to supply, a
present, actual need for water. It was not
bought to anticipate a future want, but to
meet the exigencies of an Immediate, present
want. It was, at the time of its acquisition,
actually supplying needed water, and has since
continued so to do. It at the time of the
threatened water famine In Oakland the plaint
iff had Itself purchased lands In the artesian
belt, had developed a supply and brought it to
the city for purposes' of distribution, no one,
I think, would have questioned either the pru
dence, necessity or legality of the outlay. The
fact that it acquired an existing supply in
stead of developing a new one does not change
the legal aspect of tne matter. It had the
right to acquire this new supply, and the right
to have its value estimated In fixing rates. It
it shows, as I think it was unanswerably
shown, that the purchase waa to meet a pres
ent need of the consumers. The Alvarado
Esmt. therefore, Is to be considered In fixing
we value of plaintiff's properties.
Deems Expert Testimony Unreliable.
".Judge Hart flays he deemed, the city's
expert testimony as unreliable. He casts
out of consideration tho Pinole project
and the Roberts wells as possible sources
of supply. He grants the theory of the
water, company that It should be recom
pensed for dewTrioratlon of Its plant, say
ing:
Now, In addition to just compensation upon
thin sum of $7,000,000, certain Hxeii charges arc
to be allowed and provided for. Over the Jus
tice of this allowance there 1b no controversy.
These are operating expenses and taxes, as to
which It is shown that 3 per cent upon the
valuation la a fair and conservative allowance
In a prudently managed, going toncern. In
oddltlonlt is establlifced that loss by wear
and deterioration upon T>erlshable parts- of the
property amounts annually to two and a halt
(2V4) per cent of its value, or to about 1 percent
on the value of the whole. That this should
be allowed the decision In the San Diego case
fixes beyond debute. In the main opinion It Is
said: "With regard to the question of the de
preciation of the-plant by use It Is sufficient to
nay that â¢ ordinary repairs should be charged
to current expense, and that substantial re
construction or replacement should be charged
to construction account." *Â»*#ikp Â¦
An allowance of 1 per cent permits the accu
mulation of a fund for these indicated pur
poses. ". . . ..-.;.
As to Compensation.
The decision upon. the question of com
pensation follows in part:
In the case of plaintiff it Is certainly not a
remote contingency that the artesian supply
may lessen and fail, while the breaking of
the dam would sweep away all values In the
rush of the waters.- Â¦
That such things may happen, the Johnstown
flood Is .' an ', e\-er-present reminder. Finally,
there is the added hazard that a hostile govern
ing board may - declare unremunerative and
conflscatory ! rates, thus entailing loss, expense
and^protracted migration in the establishment
of vested rights. '

defendants that . this Is â¢o Â¦ say that the law
itself is a menace.- Not, so!' It Is but Â¦ the

us if such a figure shall stand. It might
as well be $15,000,000." .
Judge Robert Y. Hayne, who conducted
the case for the city, will have charge of
the appeal, unless the City Council shall
dismiss him and, in the. event of direct-
Ing an appeal, throw the case into City
Attorney Johnson's hands. That official
has declared his opposition to the dismis
sal of Attorney Hayne > upon the ground
that Judge Hayne had full knowledge of
every phase of the case.
ThÂ« trial of this case occupied many months;
the arsuments of counsel consumed many days.
Upon seme matter* the evidence is In sharp
conflict. Upon the law applicable to the facts
the; conflict of opinion between the learned at
torneys ha* often been equally sharp. Doth
Â¦Idea have nuked for a speedy determination of
the cause, and I am myself of the opinion that
a prompt decision, at the cost of detailed dlscua
slon. Is of more consequence than a Ions de
layed one to the end that npon all these mat
ters I may ftxpress my views.
Stllr It ii with reluctance that -I have been
compelled to omit an elaborate consideration of
the conflicting- evidence, and to limit my utter
ances upon these matters to. a bare statement
of the conclusion that I have reached. My views
on the law, however, 1 1 have given in extenso.
They are the results of earnest study of an ex
ceedingly complicated question. But In finally
disposing of the matter there Is comfort In the
knowledge 'that any errors in those views will
be corrected by an appellate tribunal.
And Mayor Cries, "God "Help Us!"
In any event, therefore, the rates - fixed , are
unjust, unreasonable, unfair and 'must be set
aside. ?
If a private debtor must pay 7 per cent, why
should not the State. In regulating the profits
of a business so beset with hazards, be ex
pected to make like compensation?
I can nee no Just reason, and therefore con
clude that 7 per cent Is a reasonable basis of
return upon which to fix rates. Measured by
this test, the rates -under consideration cannot
for a moment be eupported. They would yield
under full collections but a trifle over 2 per
cent upon the valuation found. And even if 7
per cent could be held to be excessive, no one
would have the temerity to as*ert that a rate
of Interest lower than that at which the United
Statea . Government ltnelf can borrow money
upon the security of Its great wealth and of
the permanency of our national life. 1* a fair
rate of return upon an investment like this.
Seven Per Cent Reasonable Basis.
means follows that a 5 or 6 or 7 per cent rate
gives them equal return by way of profit, since
in this, as in every business, piere is still
the added factor of bad debts and failure in
collection. Even municipalities themselves
are not always to be relied on for the pay
ment of their water bills under the rates they
have established. It has been decreed by the
State that a private debtor shall pay to his
creditor 7 per cent per annum for the use of
money. Is there< *iny reason why. In -the ab
sence of an express statute to Â¦ the contrary,
the â¢ same percentage will not afford a Just
basis for the measure of the State's return
for its use of plaintiff's money?

MANY SEEK FOLD
OF THE CHURCH
So far as the ordinance attacked is con
cerned, Judge â¢ Hart finds that it wa3
passed without sufficient investigation en
the part of the Councilmen. and he quotes
from a lot of published newspaper inter
views which were, introduced In evidence
by the water company. to sustain his de
ductions on that point. The opinion also
holds that the rates as fixed were not suf
ficient to Â¦ return a fair revenue to\ the
water company. "
The decision is a very lengthy pno, a
large portion of. which is consumed ia-a
discussion of the interviews noted.
, The Question of Appeal.
" The question of an appeal is the next
consideration; - and this lies with the Citv
Council 'to say whether the Supreme
Court shall be called upon to pass upon
the decision which will vastly Increase tne
revenue of the water company (n this city.
Judge Hart lays down the following five
propositions at the outset of the decision:
Firstâ Did defendant *nd its officers, in the
matter of takings evidence before fixing the
rates, give or offer to give plaintiff a reason
able opportunity to be heard, to Introduce its
evidence and to overcome, if necessary, the
evidence' introduced against It? ~
Secondâ If the defendant and its officers did
not do bo was plaintiff injured by this failure,
refusal or neglect of the municipality, and, as
bearing upon this. 1
Thirdâ What was the value of the, property
of the Contra Costa Water Company for rate
fixing purposes at the time when the Council
fixed the rates; and
Fourthâ What is "a just and reasonable com
pensation" upon such determined value within
the meaning of the law; and Anally â¢
Fifthâ What may a court of equity do in ad
ministering Justice between such parties llti
eant Matter of Bate Fixing.
The court" then takes up the matter of
rate fixing bathe Council and elaborates
with much Â¦(retail upon the testimony of
the Councilmen and quoting at much
length from the newspaer interviews. His
general comment follows:
It may be said in a general way that the
testimony of the members of the Council, other
than those composing the Fire and Water Com
mittee clearly shows that they had not even
gone to the extent of investigating the evi
dence upon which the committee acted, but
accented the report of- said committee for the
reason as someof the Councilmen stated, that
they had absolute confidence In the honesty and
good' faith of the Fire and Water Committee.
On the subject of the. interviews Judge
Hart says: 'Â¦â¢; â¢ ,' ;
. Various members of the Council gave _ ex
pression in authorized interviews, published In
the public prints, and. proved upon the trial,
of the nature of the work they had performed
and the care they had displayed in dealing
wtth this impbrtant question. These Inter
views shed an effulgent, light upon the mat
ter, and to my mind are determinative of thl3
controverted fact. It is to be remembered
that they were given forth freely, not- under
Pressure of aÂ«ack, and it will be noted that
the inentalattltude of the . Councilmen Is one
of strong self-congratulation over their mode
of performance of this quasi-Judicial function.

Considering that this Investigation and deter

But one- conclusion â¢> upon "this I matter -'can,
therefore, bo reached:, The rates were fixed ar
bitrarily without a hearing or an opportunity

dence or upon evidence inadequate. Insufficient
and undeserving of the -name; fixed without re
gard to the actual value of the property or serv

LÂ«ke as a source of water supply, and the
necessary structures appurtenant thereto, the
construction work of the old Contra Costa
system other than San Leandro Lake, the Al
varado plant, and the clement of going or

Regarding the Valuation.
The decision as bearing upon tho valu
ation reads:
Superior Judge E. C. Hart of Sacra
mento handed down a decision In the
water-rates suit to-day that gives the
Contra Costa Water Company a complete
victory, every issue being decided in
favor of that corporation as against the
city. The valuation put upon the com
bined plants is $7,000,000, and his Honor
fixes 7 per cent net income as a fair.re
turn upon that valuation. The water
rate ordinance of 1899-1901 is declared to
ba invalid and the absorption of the Oak
land Water Company and the old Contra
Costii Water Company is held to have
been legal, the former plant at Alvarado
being declared necessary to the supply of
water to Oakland. /
If the decision shall Btand the brunt of
a Supreme Court review tho ruto payers
of Oakland will bo compelled to pay
double /what Is now being charged. The
valuation- placed upon tho works under
tne ordinance which the company is ub-
Ing won about H.GOO.OOO, with 5 per cent
net " return. It is estimated that under
Judge Hart's decision a gross return of
10 per cent on $7,000,000 will bo allowed,
tho 3, per cent covering operating and
construction expenses, 'taxes and Interest
nnd deterioration. The Contra Costa Water
Company combined lÂ» capitalized for $9,
000.000, equally divided between stock and
J AufiouRh tho water company sued for
a valuation of $8,600,000. rjono of their ex
pert engineer* in testifying came within
$1,000,000 of that figure.

The social side of the affair was on the

ed with guests whom the owners and
builders of the new vessel had Invited to
be present. Many prominent Oaklanders
were in the launching party, and as the
fhip moved slowly out of the ways the
gay gowns of the ladies on board and the
numerous Hags and pennantB fluttering
gaily in the breezes formed a pretty pic
ture.
Miss Lilla Boole was attired in a blue

her very becoming costume.

OAKLAND. May lS.-Shortly after
the mighty Ohio slid from the
ways at the Union Iron "Works
to-day a similar event, of happy
augury for Oakland's future, the
launching of the first home-built vessel,
took place at W. A. Boole & Son's shlp
>ard, at the foot of Adeline street. When
Miss Lilla Boole broke a bottle of Califor
nia champagne over the vessel's bow and
pronounced the words, "I christen ' thee
Lahaina" Ehe was cheered from pier and
shore and waiting steamers by thousands
of spectators, among whom were the
members of the Oakland Board of Trade,
the Merchants' Exchange, the City Coun
cil and other city officials and invited
guests, including many people prominent
in Oakland and San Francisco society.
No launching could have been prettier.
Many San Francisco guests came direct
from the launching of the Ohio on the
steamers from which they witnessed the
ceremonies at the Union Iron Works. At
1:46 o'clock a blow from a sledge split the
last block impeding the Lahaina' s passage
to her bridal, and she slipped noiselessly
down the ways while the hundreds of
people on her decks responded to the
cheers of the Thousands below. Then as
the glided out on the estuary the Blrens
and whistles on all sides screamed a stri
dent welcome.
Btiilt for Oriental Trade.
Oakland may well be proud of her first
EhJp, for she 1b the largest of her class
on the coast.
The Lahalna was built for Hind, Rolph
& Co. for the Oriental trade. She is a
four-masted bark, entire of 1200 tons bur
den, 245 feet in length, 41.6 feet beam and
is equipped with eteam hoisting gear, in
cluding anchor hoist and Bail-setting ap
paratus. On her first trip she will take
1,400,000 feet of lumber from Pugot "Round
to China. She will be commanded by Cap
tain N. T. Carlson, formerly of the ship
Muriel.
The keel of a Bister ship to the Lahaina
will be laid immediately by the Bootes.

MONTEZUMA COPPERâ COALâ COKE.
To-morrow, the 20th. is the last day Monte-
zuma shares may be had for 10c cash or 12c on
Installments. Tuesday morning the price will
be 12c cash and 14c on installments. A tele-
gram or a letter sent to us to-day or to-morrow
will secure the stock at the lower price.
Our clients believe the Montezuma Mining
Company of Washington have in the great com-
bination of Copper. Coal and Coke all "under
one roof" the best mining proposition on the
Paciflc Coast or In the United States, for that
matter. In which shares may be had at nominal
cost. Large bodies move slowly, but once
started the momentum is tremendous. The
Montezuma is a big concern, requiring large
capital to develop, but once a producer It w^i
continue eo throughout the ages. The share-
holders are making an Investment for a life-
time and perhaps for the lifetime of their chil-
dren as well.
We are growing rapidly on this coast and the
next ten years will witness euch development
in Industrial lines as is not to-day dreamed of
by the masses. This growth offers great oppor-
tunity for money making to all alike, but not
more than one In a thousand will avail himself
of It.
Every man owes It to himself to investigate
a promising proposition far enough to deter-
mine whether or not It is suited to his needs.
The Investigation costs him nothing, and the
failure to make It may, mean a life chance
thrown away.
The Montezuma Mining Company, with Its 24
copper mines and its 2000 acres of coal leases,
all near Puget Sound, courts investigation of
the most searching kind of both company and
properties. It is an easy matter to determine
what the Montezuma Is and has. The pros-
pectus tells the truth, but more and better evi-
dence may be had. Our excursion to the mines
leaves San Francisco June 15. Transportation
to honest Investigators, free; to others. $40 for
the round trip, including sleeper. Tickets lim-
ited to 60 days. Folder tells all about it.

New York Stock Market.
XET." YORK. May IS.â The promise of re
newed strength in stocks held out by yester
day's market was not fully realised to-day,
although the substantial early gains were not
all wiped out by the late reactionary tendency.
due principally to the bank statement. Just
at the close there was an abrupt marking up
of a few stocks to top price*, apparently by
manipulation, which itssened the appearance
of wr-akness. The disappointing feature of the
bank statement was the decrease in the cash
reserves. The preliminary estimates of the
interior currency movement indicated that re
coiptF had been so heavy as to offset the outgo
by gold export and sub-treasury requirements
and bring the net gaia in cash by the banks
to fG.CCO.CCO or upward. The statement Ehows
a decline en the contrary of Jl.233,600. The
discrepancy Is surprising, but the fact is ob
vicus t>.at the relaxation In the local money
rate has lessened th<; attraction here which
was drav.-ing money from the interior during
the Ftrir.ger.cy of lasf week and early this
week. JUFt as it has allowed gold to go to
Europe. The h*eavy sto=k market liquidation is
ehewn in the t24,204,SOO of repayments of bank
leans. It Is clear thit the money market is
again a factor to be considered in the etock
market, with receipts of currency from the
interior arrested and gold going out to Europe.
The effect of realizing was quickly manifest
this morning in stocks which had been strong
est yesterday. Atchison forged upward to the
leadership of the market and closed with a
net gain of Z%. There was no news to ex
plain the rise. Other strong features were the
local gas etocks, Baltimore and Ohio, Lack
Â¦wanra. Reck Island. Illinois Central, the Chi
cago and Alton etock?, Pittsburg, Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Louis. Northern Pacific. Great
Vorthern preferred. J.h* Ertes. the Southern
railway stocks. Wheeling and Lake Era ; first
preferred. International Power, the National
Lead etocks, Manhattan and a number or
minor industrials and tpecialties. Last prices
were decidedly below the best Jn most cases.
The decrease in loans was the largest for one
week in the history of th* Â«>Â«Â«Y**?!"*;
The Â«tock market has shown the Inevitable
after-effects of last week's convulsion during
the whole of this week In epite of opinions
voiced by the Jess rational of the speculative
elemcrt that the panic was only a sort of
Slonal insanity without real cause in ac
tual conditions and that therefor* the stock
market -was likely to come back promptly to
Its previous state. The various violent re
bounds which have occurred from the lower
1 Â°vU of prices have been cited to strengthen
these views. But violent fluctuations of the
kind witnessed this week are phenomena al
ways witne*sed In the market Immediately fol
lowing a sudden commotion. The movement
of price* is exactly analogous to that of the
waves in a pool where a eudden withdraw
of a huge displacing body forces a violent rc
oeaeion followed by an almost equally * *oje n t
rise and then lessening oscillations. â¢Â°fÂ«
who can possibly command means or credit to
hold istocks will make almost an .r *.Â°
prevent selling of property on which they ha\Â«
any claim In euch a market as that of Thurs
dav of last week. Those who are forced to eell
are throwing over holdmgs Â» n Â« * n Â«** n^ o p "^l
et which many buyers would be glad to take
them if they were at hand to do so. The ma
chinery of supply and demand Is, for the time.

Weather Report.
out of Joint, and men may be selling stocks
in one part of an excited crowd many points
below what is being paid for them a few feet
distant, while there areibther buyers more re
mote who are unable to get buying orders ex
ecuted In spite of their utmost eagerness.
That this was largely true last week is shown
by the number of acrimonious disputes which
have occurred this week concerning sold-out
accounts and needless sacrifices made in the
panic. The violent rebound in prices which
follows the first check to the panic of selling
is thus understood, l>ut when the recovery has
been made there is a lesldue of. impaired ac
counts which must be liquidated. Many Stock
Exchange houses hava admitted that the low
level of prices last week had not only wiped
out their customers' claims upon them, but
would have yielded only Insolvency for them
selves had they liquidated. They simply re
fused to sell and awaited the quick rebound.
Then they took advantage of the opportunity
to sell. It was belated liquidation of this
character which caused the violent relapses
of Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, which
reached fairly sensational proportions. With
the completion of the most urgent of this be
lated but forced liquidation there followed re
covery again. The fottnightly settlement on
the London Stock Exchange on Monday was a
complicating factor, as that market was heav
ily committed on Amsi leans and was short of
Northern Pacific, as this market had been, but
the time offered for preparation enabled Lon
don to meet the crisis and avert the panic
which was feared. With the progress made
toward ' normal conditions in the stock market
actual conditions of general business and of
individual properties have reasserted their in
fluence to some extent. The conviction is gen
eral that the embittered controversy over the
control of Northern Pacific has been adjusted.
No authentic information can be had of the
terms of the settlement, but there is evidence
that thÂ« contestants for control of Northern
Pacific have been insured against harm from
the operations of the Burlington deal and that
project has proceeded toward consummation.
There is an element in the speculation which
argues that as this controversy was the root
of the troubles which precipitated the panic
its adjustment should leave the way open to
a direct return to the boom prices for stocks.
The difficulties encountered by Humpty Dumpty
in getting himself put together again formed
an illustrative precedent for this case. This
vulnerability of the market to the shock of the
Northern Pacific episode revealed the fictitious
character of much of the buying which pro
duced the boom price. Buyers on nfargin had
stretched their credit to secure title to the
stocks which they had no means to buy out
right and for which there was no demand from
I those who could. The heavy losses suffered ,
j by these speculators is a deterrent to a re-
I sumption of buying, even by those who have
means remaining. Other deterrents are the
I largely increased margins demanded by com-
I mission brokers for the purchase of stocks and
the additional caution shown by the banks in
making loans. The ctock market liquidation
has resulted in large recuperation for the
banks and has eased tne money market so far
as to remove any obstacle to the resumption
of gold exports. The requirements of foreign
markets for gold are f'jr the most part the re
sult of the placing of the Government loans.
Paris credits are placed in the London mar
ket on a very large scale and are being with
drawn to prepare for the new Russian loan of
-about $S0.OCO.GG0, which has been placed in
Paris. But London, with an Installment of the
new consol issue to meet this week, can ill
afford to Epare gold and therefore draws on
New York, which ships gold to Paris. New
York's subscription to the new British consols
and its heavy buying of American securities
from foreigners, largo thipments of which are
received on every incoming steamer, are to
be considered In explanation of the shipment
of geld from tha country in spite of the growth
of the country's favorable balance of trade.
The April foreign trade statement showed an
excess of merchandise exports over imports for
ten months of $584, 212,300. The diminished de
mand for money for speculative purposes in
New York,' besides allowing foreign markets
to relieve their wants, lessens the importance
of the heavy drain on the money market and
the treasury. The Government's surplus for
the month thus far exceeds four million dol
lars, while for the corresponding period last
year there was an actual excess of expenditures
of over half a million. The offerings of govern
ment bonds for redemp:ion are insignificant.
Prices of bonds have not made the feverish
fluctuations shown by stocks and the volume
of business has decreased.

Associated Banks' Statement. x
NEW YORK, May 18.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ending to-day
shows: Loans $873,512,' ICO, decrease $24,204,800;
deposits $931,626,700, decrease $25,864,200; circula
tion $3L1C9,COO, increase $27,900; legal tenders
$74,317,500, increase $1,578,000; specie $176,889,100,
decrease $2,871,600; reserves $251,206,600; decrease
$1,293,000; reserve required $237,906,675, decrease
$6,466,050; surplus $13,299,925, Increase $3,172,450.
This week's decrease in loans of the clearing
house banks, amounting to $24,204,800, is the
largest on record for a '. similar period. The
largest previous decline for a week was that for
the week ended March 5, 1SS1, when there was
a contraction of $18-,039,C00. Liquidation in the
stock market is responsible for the last repay
ments through the banks this week.
The Financier says: Two records were made
in the bank statement for the current week
The decreases in loans and deposits were the
largest ever known, Just as the increase in
these items last February were the largest on
record. The current statement, however, seems
widely at variance with known .facts. It was
pointed out in this analysis Ikst week that
bank totals conflicted -In several particulars,
notably the cash holdings, and it is only by
adopting this assumption as correct that any
thing approaching a reasonable explanation of
the disappointing cash total for the current six
days can be made. The preliminary reports
of the leading institutions up to Friday showed
that over $7,CO0,000 had come' into banks above
what had been paid out, and yet the statement
of Saturday reveals an actual loss in cash of
over $1,250,000. If this is true it follows that
the condition of the banks at the beginning of
the week was such as to counteract the heavy
gains made during the last few days. . Other
wise the actual reserves of the institutions now
are much in excess of what they report. As it
was expected, however, the statement is favor
able from a cash standpoint, the fall of $25,864,
200 In deposits having released nearly $G,600,000
of required reserve, and since cash decreased
less than $1,300,000 the result is shown in an
addition to excess surplus of $5,172,450, bring
ing the total to $13,299,925. The large decrease
of $22,204,800 in loans represents in a belated
form the heavy liquidation succeeding the late
Stock Exchange panic. Its effect on the re
mainder of the statement is, -as shown, most
pronounced. Regarded in every light the cur
rent exhibit makes for an easier money mar
ket. The banks have received heavier ship
ments of currency from the Interior than for
some time past, but it is doubtful if this will
continue much longer. Spring crop require
ments must be met in the near future, and
now that the pressing needs which started a
heavy movement to this center are at an end"
it Is only natural that normal conditions again
will hold sway. This means that the tendency
of interior institutions from now on wlil ba
to reduce rather than enlarge their New York
balances, although as a matter of fact the re
action from stock panics heretofore has al
ways been reflected in a sudden rising of cash
reserves, due to receipts from miscellaneous
sources.
London Market.
LONDON. May 18.â Money was quiet to-day
and practically unlendable. Consequently dis
counts were easier. There was a disposition to
work cautiously,* in view of the heavy repay
ments to the bank on Monday.
Condition of the Treasury
The Stock Exchange operators took a 'holi
day to-day. The feeling is more cheerful,
owing to the expected relief from the (settle
ment being surmounted without disaster.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, May 18.â Trade in wheat . was
fairly active, weak cables and favorable .crop
reports, which worked to the disadvantage of
the market in the early part of to-day's ses
sion, being lost sight of later in view of the
strong export demand that developed. Dis
appointing cables induced considerable Belling

of reports of a large, continental demand, cash
buyers got into the market and a sharp rally
carrier the price to 72%@72%c. Early sup
plies were quickly absorbed, the bull leader
in corn being a conspicuous buyer. Under
pront-taking there was only aVslight reaction
and the market closed strong and %@%c high

The closing of the May deal and heavy re

Clara Valley Fruit Exchange has lately been
canvassing its section and sixteen districts re
port a Prune crop ranging from a third to a
.tenth of last year's yield. The great ma
jority report a prospective yield of from a
tenth to a quarter. The general average makes
a croD of about a quarter, or say 20.000,000
pounds, against 90,000.000 pounds for the valley
last year. If these estimates prove fairly cor
rect Prunes ought to sell this fall away above
last year's prices.

. The Allls-Chalmers Company represents the consolidation of the property and business
of the following builders of he^vy machinery:
, The Edward P. Allis CtÂ»Â» of Milwaukee, WiÂ«.
Frassr & Chalmers, Incorporated, of Chicago, III.
Gates Iron Works, of Chicago, 111.
Diskson Mfg. Co , of Scranton, Pa. (exc!n:iv2 of Locomotive Wcrlcs).
All property acquired Is to be conveyed In fee and free from mortgasre oÂ»
other lien.
No mortgage can be placed upon the property without the assent of seventy-five per
cent, of the amount of Preferred Stock outstanding.
The expert engineer, Mr. Julian Kennedy, reports, after several personal examinations
of the properties, that he estimates "the value of the plants, taking Into account the real
estate, buildings, machinery, tools, patterns, drawings and patents, together with the cost
of organizing and getting into full operation, but not estimating: anything for
good will, at f 0,035,000."
He further reports, under date of April 3, 1901. as follows:
- "I find the plants all running at their fullest capacity. The great bulk of the tools
in all of these are comparatively new, having been put in within the last seven or eight
years, and all the works are in good condition and running smoothly."
The security of the Preferred Stock, without any consideration for the ad-
vantages accruing from the. consolidation, for the -valuable good will
of- the several Companies, so long and favorably known all -over the world, or
tor the earning capacity of the united Companies, will be substantially as follows:
â¢ Cash Capital â¢ â¢ â¢ -910,000,000
of vt-hich sum $2,500,000 Trill be expended tn the
erection of nn additional plant to dpnble the pres-
ent capacity of the Allis Works. *

and freeof lien.. 0,035,000
Total present valne of tangible property 910,035,000
The total issue of Preferred Stock against this prop-
erty is 1G,25O,OOO
all of which is issued for cash at par. or, in lieu of cash, for the plants at less than their
valuation as above stated, and of which total issee there will be more than 61 per cent,
in cash, and the balance will be in property that produces much more than the cumu-
lative divided to 'which the Preferred Stock Is entitled.
Of the total Preferred Stock, *",S30.000 has been accepted by the original Companies In
lieu of cash, in part payment for their properties to be conveyed to this Company. ThÂ«
remaining JS, 400,000 is now offered for sale to provide for the discharge of existing mort-
gages and for part of the above-mentioned Cash Capital, the remainder thereof being pro-
vided by the sale of Common Stock already consummated.
The "accounts of the several concerns have been examined by Messrs. Jones. Caesar &
Co., chartered accountants, who certify "that the combined profits of these Companies, In
eac'h^of the last two fiscal years, after making full provisions for depreciation and bad
debts, but without charging interest and management salaries, exceeded the amount re-
quired to pay seven per cent, dividends upon J16.25O.00O Preferred Stock, whilst for the last
fiscal year the profits, as above defined, considerably exceeded such amount." It was not
until the last year, that the new works of Fraser & Chalmers came Into full operation.
The net profits for the fUcal year ending May 1. 1902, are estimated by the chief offi-

capacity, or for the economies of consolidation, or increase of prices, at sufficient to pay
dividends at the rate of seven per cent, on the $16,130,000 Preferred Stock and about four
per cent, on $20,000,000 of Common Stock. Including the economies from consolidation con-
fidently anticipated by these authorities, the net profits for the same period should ex-
ceed the amount required to pay seven per cent, dividends on both classes of stock.

$15,250. 000 of Preferred Stock and ten per cent, on $20,000,000 of Common Stock, with a

$ WEST COAST INVESTMENT CO., % YThere was a clatter of falling timbers:
Miss Deshler swung the bottle against
the smooth steel beak and threw it*
sparkling contents over the metal, and
then slowly, as if fearing to move, then
gathering way as the full measure of he r
freedom burst upon her. the stately
mass of metal glided awav from those
watching her. taking with her their
hearts and their prayers and proudlv
unfolding to the breezes the flag that iÂ«
at once her mission and her life. The
band reveled in the stirring bars of the
'"Star-Spangled Banner:" the scream o'
nent-up steam shrieked from a thousand
brazen throats: the thunder of guns
From far down came cjearlv the
cry â "All right." Then with a rattle of
small bells the flap on the guillotine fell,
disclosing the word "Readv." Mis?
Barber pressed the button that released
the knife; it shot downward and
through the cord, and the two ends
disappeared as the triggers swung from
their places.
The tide had reached its height, and
Â¦with 5000 tons hanging by aÂ« single
beam delay is dangerous. There was
nothing to be said, for the poem dedi
cating the vessel to the service of the
flag had been repeated, and the hopes
for success had been expressed. A be
ribboned bottle was lowered from . her
port bow by a band of red, white and
blue, and the cutting of the rope that
held the triggers only remained to be
done.
of a strinking clock the men drove
their hammers . upon their wedges
and the splitting of timber and
the. sound of falling beams min
gled with the clink of steel on
bteel and the cry of the complaining
cradle. Then as the last of the first set
of blocks and shores was tumbled down
bilence wrapped the slip again and the
people looked at their watches and
spoke in whispers and glanced
uneasily at the big I red hull,
fearful that it would take the plunge
too soon; fearful that it would not be
ready on time; fearful that it would not
leave its resting-place for the shifting,
restless element that was to be its home.
There were ten minutes left, and again
the hammers busied themselves, this
time with a nervous note of hurry in
their clatter, and the voice of the mas
ter shipwright could be heard sharp
and clear and decisive. The wedges
Tent and tore at the remaining blocks:
the painters rushed here and there with
can and brush: the sharp orders came
quicker and clearer, and on the stand
the two Scotts walked here apd there
trying to be courteous to their guests
and to seem at ease, but with all -the
Weight of the vessel on their minds.
And the ship herself, serene as the
Sphinx, unruffled by the picking of
hammers and wedges and the falling of
shores and blocks, waited quietly and
without a tremble for the word.
There was a sudden hush of the ham
mers. Workmen ran from under the
hull like bees from a hive. The master
shipwright scanned the dock up and
down on either side, for woe to the man
who remained among the blocks while
that v.eiclit was flying seaward over his
head. But the men had seen ships leave
the ways before, and thev never linger
when the sledges ce^se. Thev all were
out and a knot gathered at each fide
near the bow. where the triggers that
held her were ready to be sprung.
HEW NAVAL TEEEOE IS BORN.
rippled the water with their riot, and
from the shore and rising hills, black
with people, rose a misrhtv cheer â one
that may echo in her mighty heart some
day when most she needs it. and will
find its answer in the flutter of the flaer
still blithely waving from its staff
astern.
How It Was Done.
The launch was on when Miss Barber
pressed the button that set the little guil
lotine in motion. It was a queer little
contraption of "brass and steel brightly
burnJshed and with a curved and finely
whetted blade. It stood about two and a
half feet high and upon a table, and over
the little block that was fixed to its base
ran a tightly stretched cord of halliard
stuff. The ax was weighted by a cap of
brass and ran freely up and down on four
rods of Dolished steel. The drop was
about two feet. Topping the contrivance
was a cylinder six inches high, to which
the four upright rods were bolted. From
its lower end hung a trip hook; In Its
front was a little flap that concealed the
word "ready" until released, and inside
some little bells.
Standing with the bulb of the press
button in her hand, Miss Barber waited
for the tinkle of the bell and the falling
of the little disk of metal. She had been
carefully coached and was. warned not to
press the button before the word was
sprung in sight. Â¦ Â¦ m ' .
When all the shores had been knocked
away and everything was clear the mas
ter shipwright down on the dock searched
with his eyes up and down to see that
rone of his men were still below the hull.
Mrs. Lawrence had recited her stirring
words of dedication; the President stood
by the table watching the little guillotine;
the tiny ax had been raised and hung to
the trip hook,. and the bulb was passed to
Miss Barber, who stood beside the Presi
dent. N â¢
Near the President was Governor Nash
of Ohio. Around him were the visiting
Congressmen, Admiral Casey and the
ncval officers attached to the works and
fiom the vessels In the stream: General
Shatter, Major Rathbone. Mayor Phelan,
the Cabinet Secretaries, the Japanese
Corsul and his attaches; Ho'Yow, the
Chinese Consul, and bis suite; Chief of
Police Sullivan, the two, Scotts, J. O'B.
Gunn, General Warfleld, State Senator
Davis, Senator Belshaw, a number of Fed
era] officials and State officers, the City
Supervisors and many other -men promi
nent In city and State and nation, and a
number of ladies, the wives and friends
of the men of the party. Miss Deshler
hela the bottle of wine, one wrapped In
the red. white and blue and hanging from
the staff of a flag that projected over the
bow of the vessel. Over her frowning
hawsepipes had been draped the three
colors of the flag; bristling from her rail
and portholes were fluttering flags, from
her stern floated the national ensign and
at her Jacketaff in her bow the jack was
rolled, ready to be broken out as soon as
she should come to rest in the mud bank
opposite the slip.
As the party stood on tiptoe with ex
citement there was* the sharp ringing of
the little bell In the machine and with a
click the metal flap fell forward and
showed the shining letters of the word
"Ready."
Worked Like a Charm.
It was a signal for both the young la
lies. Miss Barber pressed the button on
the bulb In her hand and the tiny. -ax
flashed downward like a. ray of light. It
â¢shore clean through the cord and the two
ends so' suddenly released disappeared
through the holes In the table by which
he cord reached and ran over the blocK.
Down under the hull there was a sound
as of the striking of a heavy mallet and
he rumble of falling timbers, and with
lut a second's hesitation the Â«reat hull
started slowly down the wavs, her bows
'oaming with the contents of the bo:tle
Miss Deshler had Just broken against her
'ide as she said. "I christen thee Ohio."
What the little guillotine did was to re
ease two "dog shores," the 'ast things

log shores were beams of heavy timber,
â¢Ight inches square and four feet loner.
On the under side of each was a heaw

vhen the weight was released it swung

There were ropes enough' holding; down
the chain to raise a thousand tons and
all of them were needed to curb the big
red hull and bring it to rest. The vessels
stopped about 250 yards from where, since
April 22, 1899. when her keel was laid, she
had grown j from a few wavering . lines on

planes,? sixteen Inches across and about a
foot apart being run down each side of
the slip. One end of the "dog shore'
reached up between these two ways on
each side and caught against the sliding
ways that formed the slipping surface of
the cradle bearing the ship; the other end.
took. against a timber bolted between each
cet of stationary ways and was kept from
slipping down and out by a timber that
reached from under the end of ?he,"dcg
Bhore" to a bloqk set firmly in the floor
of the wharf. '.The arm bearing the weight
was swung at . the supported end of the
% "dog shored' and the trigger that held the
weight atthe other end of the shore was
caught with a \ylre: this wire was fast to
a cord and tills cord ran on to the launch
ing stand, up through the table, over tho
block of the little guillotine ami down to
the trigger on tho other "dog shore," so
that there was '.no possibility of one
weight falling without the other. When
the cord was cut the weights were re
leased; they swung down and brought up
against the supporting timber under the
end of the "dbs shore": it .lew from its
place and. free of all holding, tne, vessel
started for the water. !
With the gathering way the problem of
checking the ship before she rhad run
clear across the basin and up against the
oil wharves at the other side became
more serious, but ropes and chain and
the mud bank finally stopped her as gent
ly as- a feather bed. -*i*ia^/#<Â»i
Shackled to her on each side was a
chain that might hold a fleet. Where it
was made fast to her was just forward
of her waist; and then it was led to the
floor of the wharf and down alongside
of her to the water's edge, where It was
firmly shackled. At intervals, and short
ones, along the dock, It was "stoppered','
or tied down with bands of rope capable
of holding tons of weight, and as the
vessel slid down these stoppers cracked
like pistols as the chain reached and tore
through them as If they were threads.
