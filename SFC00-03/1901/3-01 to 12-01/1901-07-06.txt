With each of these gifts went tho same
condition exacted in our own case, L e..
that the city receiving It should bind it

which the grift was made.
In many Instances, as with New York,
sites were to be provided by the. cities,

aided by Mr. Carnegie's liberality have
been called after his name, the old tltlea

done in the cities having a number of
branch libraries like St. Louis- and. New

bearing that 'name will number ovsx two

San Francisco is a largro, wealthy, and well
governed municipality. It Is llvlnsr under, a
charter which went into' effect on the first of
January, 1900.- which Is regarded -as a : model of
Its kind. Among other things. It does not per

dollar upon a hundred dollar valuation, and the
budget amounts annually to about $5,060.(00,
one-half the amount ' which Â¦ It coats in " New

establishment. This organic check upon ex-Â»
penditurea, which you will agree is wise and
prudent, requires . us to Issue bonds for extra

Around the cashier's vault are ranged
pigeon holes, each hole being intended
for a sack of t srold containing $5000. '.The
capacity of thÂ© vault Is five millionVdol

millions were piled up' on the , floor' and
on trucks. ; The six stolen sacks were

"We have counted all the money In the
cashier's vault," he said, "and have also
counted thÂ© contents of the sealed vaults.
We are satisfied that the money was stol
en and not paid out in error. The question
of an error In the books of the Mint is
a thing of the past. Thl3 money was stolen
and stolen by an employe who had the
combination to the cashier's vault. Cash
ier Cole alone is thÂ© possessor of the com
bination. I do not know It and a copy
of the combination was written out and
sealed up by Cole when he came into of
fice and locked up In the office desk. This
was a precaution In case of the illness of
thÂ© cashier. Chief Clerk Dimmick wasnot
supposed to know the combination. The
only time hÂ© had occasion to go" into thÂ©
office was at the close of business' each
day. Then he accompanied, the cashier
and tallied up the number of sacks of
gold.
Superintendent Leach stated yesterday
that hÂ© had nothing new to report on the
stealing of the $30,000. -V~<
Superintendent Leach Speaks.
This Information formed the basis for a
eearching Investigation by Secret Service
Agent Hazen as to whether Dimmick' was
well acauainted with the combination of
the vault door, which Cole was alone sup
posed to know. V.V.-i
. It .was. learned. yesterday on positive au
thority that when Cole came Into ofnee he
requested his predecessor, . Dimmick, to
show him how the locks on the vault door
of thÂ© cashier's office worked. Cole is
known to have operated thÂ© combination
knob while Dimmick stood at the back of
the door and arranged the levers and
tumblers In the locks.
Further questions put to Dimmick as to
the manner in which the combinations on
the cashier's vault worked, elicited the re
ply that he knew the working of the- vault
door, but was not acquainted with the
combination formed by Cashier Cole.
perhaps I may be â what do you call
itâ^h, yes â the criminal at the bar."
'"Do you expect to be arrested, then,"
was the next query, put to Dimmick.
"It would not surprise me, but I am not
worrying," was Dimmlck's answer.
The time records of the Mint thus show
that there , were dozens of. opportunities
The time records at the Mint show that
Cashier Cole left the building usually at
3:16 p. m., 3:30 p. m., or 3:45 p. m. Occa
sionally the cashier remained until 4 p.
m. when . the .business of - his office re
quired. Fitzpatrick always left the build
ing shortly after 3 p.\m., and. the book
keepers of the cashier's office remained
Sometimes until 4:30 p. m. . or, even : later,
according to the amount of work on hand.
Captain Timothy Fitzpatrick. -the
"vault man" In the cashier's office. Is the
only man besides Cole and Dimmick who
ever entered the steel room. It was Fitz
patrick's duty to wheel trucks of gold
Into the vault and to bring gold out when
requested by Cole. The cashier was the
only person who had authority to order
Fitzpatrick to â¢ bring sacks of gold from*
the . vault. â¢ ' '
If Cole had reason to leave .his office
during the time the vault door was open,
no other employe in the office could have
entered the vault without Fitzpatrick be
ing cognizant of the act. Fltzpatrick" is
an old employe and his duty would have
been to stop any person, no matter what
his position in the Mint, from entering the
vault, unless accompanied by Cashier
Cole, or whoever was acting as cashier
in Cole's absence.. â¢ â¢ (> ,
: Mute Evidence of Time Clocki.
â¢Cashier Cole has Informed the investi
gating officers that it was his custom to
lock the vault of his office each day at
8 p. m. â¢ The time lock for many years
has not gone into operation until 6 p. m.,
and that would give two hours for any
person to open "the vault,- provided he
knew the lock combination. â¢ Â¦ Â¦â¢ .
The investigation is therefore proceed
ing on the line that the six sacks of gold
coin were abstracted from the vault at
different times.
The authorities are satisfied that the
missing gold was stolen between the
hours pf 3 p.m. and 5'p. m. of working
days. Each sackof g-old weighs almost
twenty pounds, and while' it would be
possible for one sack : to be carried out
of the building, It would have been im
possible for the thief- to get away with
over 100 pounds weight of yellow coin.

CASHIER W. K. COLE and Chief
Clerk Walter Dimmick of the
Mint were relieved yesterday of
the duties of their offices, in ac
cordance with Instructions re
ceived from the Secretary of the Treas

A. Pedlar, a trusted clerk of Superintend
ent Leach, and Dimmick turned over the
details of his department to Benjamin W.
Day, a computing clerk In ' the superin
tendent's office.
Both Cole and Dimmick were on hand
at their desks to assist their temporary
successors, but the trust formerly reposed
in them by the Government was tempor
arily Â¦withdrawn, pending the investiga
tion into the shortage of 530,000 from the
cashier's working vault.
The Government officials who are
at work on. the robbery have nar
rowed down their investigation to the
point -where the arrest of a suspected
employe may occur at any hour.
Director of the Mint Roberts, Superin
tendent Leach and Secret Service Agent
Hazen were In close consultation yester
day and examined many of the Mint em
ployes. The investigation will be contin
ued on the lines that the thief who stole
530,000 from, the cashier's vault is not only
an employe of the Mint but is also one
in whom the greatest faith has been here
tofore reposed.
Suspected Employe "Watched.
A chain of evidence is being gradually
woven around the suspected person/and
a close watch is being kept- on his move
ments. The slightest attempt to leave the
city will be the signal for his arrest by
Secret Service Agent Hazen.
The officials who are making the Inves
tigation refuse to give the name of the
puspeeted employe, and all persons con
nected with the Mint were warned yes
terday that thpy. must keep silent as to Â¦
the possible identity of the suspected
man.
The authority in Washington have no
tified the officials In this city that the
culprit must be brought to Justice and
punished for his gross betrayal of the
trust reposed In him. The delay in mak
ing the arrest is due to the lack of cer
tain evidence necessary to secure a con
viction in the Federal courts.
The Mint was thoroughly searched yes
terday by Secret Servire Agent Hazen
and his assistants. In the hope that some
of the purloined gold might be found hid
den away In some rook or corner. The
search, however, was unavailing and the
cor elusion was reached that the thief had
taken his plunder out of the building.
Director of the Mint Roberts, Superin
tendent Leach and Secret Service Agent
Haicn were 'gTiarded In' their statements
yesterday. They- were willing to talk to
a certain length but declined to make any
aFserticns that might furnish a clew to

Diramick Is Flippant.
< a*hier Cole, who alone was supposed to
have bad the combination of thÂ« vault
from which $30,000 ln_ gold was stolen, is
deeply concerned over the affair. Chief
Cleric Dimmick. who had access to the
cashier's vault, but who denies that he
had the combination to the steel door,
treats the question of the robbery in a
flippant manner and yesterday Joked as to
the possibility of his arrest.
Cashier Cole declined to make any state
ments yesterday, but Dimmick talked
freely on the subject.
When Dimmick was asked if he was fa
miliar with the vault combination of Cash
ier Cole he answered in the- negative. He
Â¦was then questioned as to the statement
made that he assisted Coie to fir the com
bination when thÂ© cashier took office."

for a -person who knew the combination
of tha, cashier's vault to open the steel
door, steal a sack of gold and leave the
building long before the time lock began
its operations on the vault at 5 p. m>
The investigating officials are almust
certain that the six sacks of gold were
stolen within the past four months. Early
in the year the gold coinage of the Mint
commenced to - accumulate and four
months ago, the pigeon holes in the cash
ier's working-'Tault were filled. It was
for the gold to have been ab
stracted before that time. The cashier or
. superintendent could have entered the
vault any, day at the close of business
and a" single glance around the vault
would hare shown if a single sack were
missing. '
When millions of dollars in gold coin
were" piled ' Into the vault and on trucks
and stacked -many feet high and still oth
er truckloads were left on the carriers it
was impossible to see if any of the pigeon
holes were vacant. The thief, familiar
with the manner in which the gold was
counted, took speedy advantage of the
opportunity and began his stealings.
Each sack of gold received by the cash
ier from the coiner bore a tag number.
The tag showed the date of coinage, the
weight of gold and the gross weight of
contents, bag and lead seal. In paying
out large sums of money the cashier
would order Captain Fltzpatrick, the vault
man, to take the required sum from the
steel room. No memorandum was made
of the tag numbers of the sacks, and it
Is therefore Impossible to find out the
numbers of. the. stolen sacks . of -gold.
Amounts paid out, too heavy-to" be paid
over .the counter, were, piled by the vault
man on a truck, in the presence of the
cashier. The vault man would wheel: the
truck to a side door of the Mint, where It
was delivered to the payee or hia repre
sentatives.
Director of the Mint Roberts, who has
been In charge of the' .building for the
past week, yesterday removed all the gold
from the cashier's worKing vault and af
ter counting it, sealed the treasure in a
large vault. One million dollars was placed
in the working vault and Temporary
Cashier Pedlar gave a receipt for the
amount. . Pedlar, at the close of business
hours, locked the steer doors of the vault
and also placed a seal on the door.
Director of the Mint Roberts yesterday
sent a request to Washington for assist
ance in the Investigation of the robbery.
Chief of Secret Service Wilkle immedi

IN FIRE'S CLASP
CHICAGO, July 5.â A rate- fight of lib
eral proportions is on among the trunk
lines operating between Chicago""and Mis
souri River point centers. For several
weeks there has been widespread, though
seciet manipulation of rates on all
classes of freight In this territory, but
there had been no open rupture between
any of the roads until to-day.
When it became -evident that peace
could not be restored except by some
drastic action officers of several of the
roads began to plan open reductions in
tariffs. The Santa Fe was the first to
act, and to-day came out with an an
nouncement that it would put in a scale
of rates, effective July 15. between this
city and Southwestern Missouri River
points that would awake the secret rate
cutters to a realization of the situation.
The rates promulgated by the Santa Fe
average reductions of from 30 to 40 and
In some cases 50 per cent below the pres
ent printed tariffs. .
It is believed that the action of the
Santa Fe will be followed by similar an
nouncements by all competitors and that
the cuts are intended to bring the long
standing secret fight for business to a
head and to force the lmes that have
been out of the pool to become members.
\V. B. Blddle, freight traffic manager of
the Santa Fe, discussing the cut in rates,
sald: - '.
"In making an open reduction In rates
we are only doing what most of our com
petitors have been doing secretly for
many weeks. Our traffic between Kan
sas City and Chicago has been decreasing
week by week until It is now only 4 or 5
per cent of the total traffic between these
points, while one of the weakest lines Is
carrying over 16 'per cent. Such a con
dition of affairs could only be caused by
secret rate cutting by our competitors.
To stop such business we determined to
make wholesale reduction in rates openly.
If this reduction proves to be. insufficient
to stop secret rate cuttings we will open
ly make another big one. As soon as we
are given assurance that all our competi
tors will maintain reasonable rates we
.will advance ours to a normal basis, but
not before then."

Special Dispatch to' The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 5.â Since Princess
Hatzfeldt was born in this city and taken
from here while a child by the late C. P.
Huntington, and since her mother, Mrs.
Clara Prentice, has been for many years
and is still a resent of Sacramento, local
interest in the story of a prospective con
test of the Huntington will by the Prin
cess has been keen. This Interest was in
tensified a few days ago, when the Prince
and Princess and Attorney J. D. Redding
came to Sacramento and had prolonged
conferences with a local attorney. The
Bee to-night makes the declaration upon
what It evidently deems good authority
that suit has actually been- brought by
the Princess and that the visit of the
Princess to her mother in this city was
in large part for the- purpose of making
sure of her testimony in case the con
test were brought to an issue. Says the
Bee: ,
Fight Opens in New York.
"Among those familiar with the trou- !
bles growing out of the settlement of the ;
Huntington estate it is believed that some ;
compromise will be -effected with Priit
cess Hatzfeldt. Prince Hatzfeldt said
when in Sacramento a few days ago there
would be no contest of the will of C. P. i
Huntington, but this is understood to he Â¦
only a legal quibble. Technically there :
will be co contest of the will, but as a
matter of fact a suit was begun In New
York some months ago by Princess Hatz
feldt for a daughter's portion of the es
tate, under contract. This is In effect a
contest of the will, In that It would result
In a different division of the estate.
"Princess Hatzfeldt bases her suit upon
an alleged agreement by C. P. Hunting
ton. when he took her from her mother,
2>.lrs. Prentice, that he would rear her da
his daughter. The Hatzfeldts hold this
to mean that she would receive a daugh
ter's share in the estate and suit has been
brought in New York upon the contract
under this construction. With this view
of the case, it makes no difference, in th<;
opinion of the Hatzfeldt attorney, wheth
er there was a legal adoption or not, and
the adoption question does not figure in
the suit. * . .
Beason for Their Visit.
"Concqrning the recent visit of Princess
Hatzfeldt to her mother and^later of her
husband, the Prince,. and their attorney,
Joseph D. Redding, the assertion that the
visits were purely of a social and filial
character must be taken in the light of
the suit already brought- Mrs. Prentice
is an important factor in the case as a
witness, and the trip of the Hatzfeldts
and their attorney was made both for
the purpose of cementing the relations- be
tween mother and daughter, and of con
firming such evidence as the Hatzfeldt
interests bearing upon the contract un
der which they sue. Prince Hatzfeldt and
his attorney were in close consultation
with Attorney Frank D. Ryan while in
this city and Mr. Ryan is understood to
represent them here. The Princess spent
much of her time with <ier mother.
Â¦"Concerning the probability of a com
promise, it is believed that in order to
prevent the suit being brought to trial
H. E. Hutington, who, with Mrs. C. P.
Huntington. the widow, is the principal
heir under the will, will consent to a set
tlement which will be satisfactory" to the
Hatzfeldts. It Is understood that Mrs. C.
P. Huntington is willing to effect a set
tlement, but the opposition comes from
H. E. Huntington. It is known that Mrs.
H. E. Huntington, who is a sister of. the
Princess, is not upon friendly terms with
the latter."
THE PRINCESS HATZFELBT.
Her Alliance With the Prince.
Her Early Xife in Sacramento and
Though a native of California, Princess
Hatzfeldt has practically spent the whole
of her time since 1875, when she was 14
years of age, in the East or abroad. ' .
The Princess is the daughter of Mrs.
Clara F. Prentice. 1401 L street, Sacra
mento, widow of Edward Prentice, for
merly a grocer in that city. Her mother
e.nd Collis P. Huntington's first wife were
sisters. She was born in the two-story
and basement brick house, 310 M street,
Sacramento, in 1S6L Her father was
drowned in the great flood of the Sacra
mento in 1SG2, and left but a small estate.
Huntington, wno was then a man of
considerable means with no children of
his own, became very fond of his wife's
niece when she was yet learning to walk
ana prattle and in lSt>4 arranged with her
mother for her adoption as his own
daughter. She had been christened Clara
Louisa, which names Mr. Huntington
wished to change. The mother would only
agree to a partial change and Clara
Louisa Prentice became Clara Elizabeth
Muntington. She grew up in her foster
father's house, but, being so close to her
mother, a great deal of her time was
spent with her and perforce the natural
ties grew stronger to the detriment of
the new ones. There was clash of Juris
diction and it was thought best that she
should go East and enter a boarding
school.
This she did and at one and another
she remained until she was grown to
womanhood, when she made her debut at
Mr. Huntington's mansion In New York
and took her place in society as his
daughter. He in the meantimeâ in 18S4â
had married a second wife, Mrs. A/ B.
Yarrington of Alabama, with whom the
young foster daughter traveled much in
this country and in Europe for several
years.
German Prince a Suitor.
On one trip to Europe Miss Huntington
met Prince Paul Hatzfeldt-Wildenberg.
the nephew of Count Paul Hatzfeldt, the
German Embassador at London, and a
scion of the ancient Austro-German
house of that name.
Preliminary negotiations on the part of
the Prince for iliss Huntington's hand
brought Mr. Huntington himself on the
scene, but the demands for advances of
ready money to pay pressing clebts and
for the marriage settlement were not to
his liking, and the negotiations were
dropped for the time. They were renewed
later, however. The Prince yielded every
point as far as his demands on the Hunt
ington purse were concerned. He scaled
down the figures representing his press-.
Ins debts to the amount the American
magnate had expressed, a willingness to
pay, but which he had at first indignantly
refused.
Mr. Huntlngton provided the 5500,000
necessary for this purpose and settled
$3,000,000 on his daughter for life with re
mainder to her Issue, This sum was de
posited in three American banks and she
was at liberty to check for the income
therefrom at any time during the year.
The marriage was celebrated at Brorap
ton Oratory. London, October 28, 1089.

prelate of that city, officiating. The* af

American Embassadors to Lonrlon. 'with
several members of Prince Hatzfeldt's
family. The bride's costume cost $3000.
Hatzfeldts Objected.
The Hatzfeldts had at first demurred
to the alliance, but at the eleventh hour
made the best of it and received the Hunt
irstons with effusive cordiality.
On Mr. Huntington's death it was found
that he had made further provision for
bis daughter, but not so liberally as was
probably expected. By the terms of his
will, which was probated in New York
August 21. .1900, shortly after his death,
he disposed of an estate then thought to

SAN RAFAEL* July 5.â The fire that
started on Mount Tamalpais yesterday af
ternoon is still raging on the northern
slopes. Gangs of men were this morning
dispatched to the scene and every effort
Is being made to subdue the names. "Word
was received this afternoon from William
Barr, superintendent of the Tamalpais
Water Company, that the fire was uniler
control. Later in the afternoon, however,
a fresh breeze fanned the flames into re
newed life and hundreds of acres of brush
and forest were soon aflame.
The fire started on the picnic grounds
at the western end of Lake Lagunitas.
Heroic efforts were made at the time to
get it under control. The water company
sent wagonloads of men to the scene:
It was believed the fire would burn itself
cut during the night, but this morning
found the flames leaping merrily toward
the west and north. The flumes supply
ing this city with water were in jeopardy,
but hard work saved them.
To-night the conflagration was racing
toward Bill Williams Gulch, where it will
prove hard to control. Efforts are being
made to "back-fire" along the old wagon
road leading to the summit of the moun
tain. If these be successful the scope of
the fire will be confined to the mountain
itself. It is now in some of the heaviest
brush in the county, where it is impossi
ble for men to accomplish much.
Every precaution has been taken and
the tavern at the summit of the mountain
is believed to be safe. Near the top of
the mountain the brush is short and com
paratively thin and the fire could easily be
checked should It ascend that far.

peared, and staring me l:i the face said:
" "Well, now. If there is; going to be any
catching I will do it.'
"Of course, I was thoroughly frightened,
and the fact that every door and window
In the house was locked securely Hashed
over my mind instantly. In fact, I was
almost stunned for a moment and did not
know what to do. Upcn regaining my
senses my first thought was, what means
should I : adopt in defending myself? Run
ning into the front room the first object I
saw was a saber, which my sister and I
had often used at practice. Naturally I
am somewhat efficient with its use. for
when papa lived in Los Angeles he had
sister take fencing lessons from a French
professor for several months. When I
took the saber into my hands I turned
around and saw that the stranger had
followed me into the room, j Looking at a
center table he saw a long sword, which
papa uses at lodge. He Quickly rushed
by me, and picking it up said angrily:
" 'If that is your game, two can play
at it.' - .
Brave Miss Lemon's Story.
Miss Nlta and her sister are expert
fencers, having taken lessons of profes
sional swordsmen. Without a word tha
girl caught up a heavy, saber standing in
a corner of tha parlor and menaced her
antagonist, who retreated until he caught
sight of a light sword lying on a table.
He grasped this, saying:: "If that is your
game, I'm in on it." x
With that they confronted one another
and the fight began. The girl was finally
wounded in the left arm and her clothing
slashed in several places. Realizing that
she was fighting- for her life, she fought
desperately, and . finally struck her op
ponent a heavy blow on the shoulder with
the back, of the saber that caused him to
stagger. Before he could recover Miss"
Nita pressed her advan tage and struck
him again on the neck, just under the ear.
He fell and the girl, not waiting to see
the result, fled to the house of a neighbor,
whence shortly afterward the stranger
was seen running across fields from the
house. â¢ .
SAX BERNARDINO, July 5.â "Two or
three times I could have run my saber
clear through my adversary, but tha
thought of seeing blood stopped me. .My
chief thought was to protect myself and
escape. I had no desire -whatever to hurt
him. He thrust at me several times, but
only once did he hurt me, and that was
oh the arm. The wound la quite sore and
pains me considerably, but I will venture
he yet feels that blow I gave him, on
the head.'*
Thus spoke Miss Nlta Lemon, the 17
year-old daughter of Charles Lemon, a
conductor on the Santa Fe. In describing
to-night her experiences in one of tha
most remarkable sword duels on record.
The young girl, attacked by a strange
man, who invaded her home while she
was alone, had picked up a saber with
which to defend herself. Her assailant,
himself an adept at fencing, had seized
the weapon's mate. In the battle for life
that followed Miss Lemon's expert sword
play stood her in such good stead that
she succeeded in puttin;? her opponent to
flight after herself receiving a slight
scratch on the arm.
Miss Lemon's father was in Bakers
field and her mother in San Fran
cisco, and the young lady was left
to stop with her grandparents at
night and to care for the house by day.
On Tuesday morning wtile making a tour
of inspection of her home she was sud
denly confronted by a man whom she de
scribes as French in appearance and ac
terit. The man was between her and the
door and advanced toward her with hos
tile mien. .â¢-, .

AMERICAN INTERESTS
. SAFE IN VENEZUELA
This Inference Is Drawn by Officials
Because of the Departure of
the Mayflower.
WASHINGTON. July- 5^â American in
terests in Venezuela are not apparently
menaced by internal troubles. This is the
Inference drawn by naval officials to-day
from a dispatch received announcing that
the Mayflower had left La Guayra for San
Juan, Porto Rico. No statement relative
to conditions in Venezuela accompanied
the dispatch. The authorities say that
had a situation existed which was dan
gerous to American interests the May
flower would not have left Venezuelan
waters. The State Department believes
that the Mayflower's visit has had a good
effect, as it has established the purpose
of the United States to send a warship to"
Venezuela whenever it desires to do so
and has shown that Mr. Loomis was not
responsible, as charged by the Venezuelan
press, for the repeated visits of American
warships to La Guayra,

Clifton Man Kills His Wife and Him

Insane.
PHOENIX, Ariz., July 5.â Ed Harwell
shot his wife through the head at Clifton
on Sunday, killing her instantly. He then
turned his revolver upon himself and blew
out his brains. The tragedy was not dis
covered for nearly four hours, though the
shots had been heard by neighbors. When
they finally entered the house they found
the woman sitting at the dinner table
dead, having been shot from behind, the
bullet entering back of her left ear. Har
well was lying on his back on the floor,
toward the door.
No reason can be ascribed for the deed
except temporary insanity, as the couple
have had no trouble that the public is
aware of. There was no suspicion of
Jealousy and they were financially in easy
circumstances. Mrs. Harwell and her
daughter, a beautiful child of ten years,
were to have left on the following day on
a visit to relatives In Texas. All prepar

Harwell was seemingly pleased at their

"Dogmatically speaking the position of
Judaism in respect to the founder of
Christianity is altogether negative as de
nying his divinity, though the pivot on
which Christianity revolves, Jesus of
Nazareth, has no place In Jewish theol
ogy. The conception of his historical po
sition and of his significance in the de
velopment of religion is a matter of in
dividual view and conviction, as is also
the pointing out and application to tho
Jewish nature of many of the beautiful
moral teachings attributed to Jesus, but
these cannot form part nor be Incorpor

RABBIS DEFINE
THEIR DOCTRINE
NEW YORK. July 5.â By the will of the
late Jacob S. Rogers, the millionaire loco
motive builder of Paterson, N. J., the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city
Is to receive an enormous endowment
fund of anywhere from $5,750,000 to 57,750,
000. With the exception of eight bequests
amounting to only $250,000, the entire es
tate of the eccentric old gentleman, who
for years led the life of a scml-recluse,
is bequeathed to the museum that is de
voted to matters concerning which Rog
ors had little knowledge and In which he
was supposed to have even less interest.
This prfneely endowment will" put the
Metropolitan Museum of Art on a basis
of financial resources superior, probably;
to that of any similar institution in the
world. It raises it from a position . of
comparatively narrow resources to one of
great affluence.
The estimate of ?20,000.000 as Rogers'
fortune, which frequently was made prior
to his death, undoubtedly is In excess of
the real amount. He was secretive con
cerning his affairs to a. degree that at
times seemed to amount to absurdity. He
left deeds which give promise to being
the basis of one of the greatest will con
tests ever known in the New Jersey
courts. Nowhere in his will is there a
provision which cuts off any of the indi
vidual legatees if they make a contest.
In other words* not one of them has any
thing to lose and all of them have every
thing to gain by attacking the will.
It is not merely the relatives of Rogers
who are disappointed by the terms of his
will. The city of Paterson, where he and
his father before him made all his vast
fortune, gets not one cent from him, in
any shape whatever. It was fully ex
pected by many that he would at least
give to the city for a public park a large
tract of land which he owned in the
heart of the resident' district- This wide,
unkept area, with Its shabby fences and
general air of neglect, has long been an
eyesore in the thriving little city.

Rodg-ers from the action of the auditor
for the Navy Department, disallowing his
claim for the pay and allowances of a
major general of the army from February
11 to March 13. 1901, as a rear admiral
above the lowest nine numbers of that
grade*-a decision has been rendered by
Assistant Comptroller of the Treasury L.
P. Mitchell. In effect he decides that of
fices of the navy advanced in numbers
pursuant to law for services in the Span
ish war and carried as additional num
bers, are advanced contemporaneously
Â¦with the officers next above them. He
holds that they cannot be counted in de
termining what officers in the -grade of
rear admiral belong to the next lowest
numbers in estimating the pay of officers
of that grade.
The method has been for persons' to ac
quire them under the homestead lav/ and
then transfer them tt> those desiring thorn,
who would be unable to acquire them in

that. can- be acquired by an individual. is
limited. It is understood that persons ac
quiring titles have been. given money to
pay the Government price for the land

Tber<* are people who say that the
benefit derived from the use of put-up
medicines is imaginary. It is not the
case with Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescrip-
tion, which -makes weak women strong
and sick women well. A woman may
imagine she's weak, or may fancy she's
rick, but her imagination can't add forty
pounds to her weight. The positive
proof oi the curative power of r Favorite

of health which is recorded in face and
form, of strength which can be tested,
and weight which can be registered in
pounds and ounces.
The general health _ of women is so
intimately connected with the local
health of the â¢womanly organs that
when these are diseased the whole body
suffers loss. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-

The regatta on Lake Merritt on the
Fourth was so successful that it is highly
probable that it will become an annual
event. The lake is the only place in the
neighborhood of San Francisco where
shell-rowing can be satisfactorily carried
on. all the open waters of the bay being
too rough, and choppy for light boats, es
pecially during the summer season. The
outrigged skiff, which until recently was
a heavy boat, intended for rough water,
has, by a gradual process of evolution,
become almost as light and fragile aa a
shell, and the four-oared barges have also
pretty well reached the limit at lightness
of construction for boats of that type.
Hence the need for smooth water, where
a race can be carried out without the dan
ger of half the competitors befng swamp
ed, has become more urgent. The regatta
on Thursday was carried out with com
mendable promptitude and without mis
nap, nearly all the events proving lnteresi
,i a R? P r ?vldins' good contests.
All the rowing races were worth seeing
except the Junior shell event, In which
Harry Nelson of the Alameda Boat Club
rowed over the course in a skiff in order
to secure the prize for his clubmate.
George Lewis. The latter waited while
kelson came up to him so as to produce
the appearance of a contest, but won as
he liked.
The swimming races . were over short
courses the 100-yard event being not
more than seventy-five yards, and the
quarter-mile hardly 300 yards, and were
marred by the usual squabbling which
seems inseparable from swimming events.
The relay swimming race, 450 yards
with nine relays, was close and ex
citing, but the losing Olympic team diÂ«i
not display good sportsmanship in refus
ing to take part In the water-polo game
against the Lurllne Swimming Club.
As regards the rowing events, the senior
barge race was won by the Alameda crew,
rowing fifty-two strokes toÂ» the mlnut*
over part of the eourse. but keeping good
time; the intermediate barge event fell to
the South Ends, who rowed a longer
stroke well pulled through; while the
junior barge race was won by the Ariel
crew, which rowed . In the Native Sons'
regatta last year. The Alameda Boat Club
won three first and three second prizes,
the South Ends won one first and two
second places, the Dolphins won two first
prizes in single events, the Ariel Rowing
Clug won one first prize, and the Olym
pic Boat Club took second place in one

REGATTA.
Tuesday evening- the challenge of the Val
lejo Yacht Club for the . Perpetual cup
was accepted, and it was decided to de
fend the trophy with Frank Stone's sloop
Presto. The defending yacht must not
exceed 28.75 feet In racing length, the
challenger having a racing length of 26.14
feet. Though the racing length of Frank
Stone's sloop is 29.3, she can easily be
brought within . the limit by putting in
more compact ballast, so as to shorten
her water line, lowering the band on her
mast and making a few readjustments.
The regatta committees of the Corinthian
and Vallejo Yacht Clubs will shortly meet
together to arrange a date for the race
and settle the other details. Frank Stone
has been officially notified of the selection
of his boat as the cup defender, and the
members of the regatta, committee have
been officially requested to be up and
doing. The Corinthian regatta committee
consists of P. J. Maxtenstein, E. B. Learn
ing and W. P. Harrold. Though the sloop
Helen was designed and built In Matthew
Turner's yard at Benlcia, as was the
sloop Gadder, she is by no means so
freakish looking as that craft.
Owing to the fact of the Fourth falling

but returned to their moorings In the
evening. The sloops Freda and Aeolus
Â°f the Corinthian Yacht Club went ui> to
Â£apa City, where the whole club had
been invited to attend a reception and
dance. But as it was found impossible
to get enough Corinthian boats together
to make a really creditable display for the
club. It was deemed best to drop the
cruise as a club event, leaving it open lor
any members who desired to do so to
make the trip independently.
J. R. Savory's sloop Juanlta suffered
some damage in the heavy weather of
last Sunday, blowing out her jib On
Monday there was a stiff wind, and the
sloop broke away from her moorings to

If there was ever a doubt as to who
Â¦was the best tennis player in the Western
States that doubt was dispelled on Thurs
day when George Whitney won the cham
pionship of the State. He beat both the
Hardys easily in the last two tournamepts
for the championship of the coast, and
his victory over his brother Robert in the
last tournament places him in a class by
himself. Many were of the opinion that
the champion was going backward in his
game, but his play during the week shows
that he is now more skillful than he ever
was.
Bob Whitney, who for several years has
been ranked !n a class right above the
tsecond class and below the Hardys and.
his brother George, has been . improving
very rapidly of late, and if these four ex
perts were to come together Bob would
be very likely to rank close to the top.
Kor one set he plays an even better game
than the champion, but he cannot last
longer than that.
Fred Brown surprised everybody by the
game he played at San Rafael. Heretofore
he has always appeared very nervous, but
in the last tournament he was very cool
and played a sure, 6Wift game. Brown Is
one of the most promising players on the
coast and will be a factor in future events.
Ogden Hoffman and Harry Halght.
two crack players of ten years ago. made,
their reappearnce at San Rafael and
6howed that they have lost none of their
"-former skill. Hoffman's work in partic
ular was very good, and with a little more
practice he would be very near the top of
the second class.
With the singles and doubles tourna
ment scheduled for the early part of Sep
tember, the cracks will have very little
time to rest. It Is to be hoped that by
the time the next tourneys come off the

The coursing season which has just been
inaugurated promises to be by far the
best In the annals of the sport.
John A. Klein, J. H. Rossiter and W.
C. Glasson have been appointed a com
mittee of arrangements for the John
Grace Challenge.Cup stake which will be
run in October." The committee held a
meeting and prepared a circular In which
a schedule of prizes has been suggested.
Copies will be mailed to all the promi
nent coursers and their approval of -the
offerings for the event will be solicited. .
The onÂ« feature upon which much de
pends Is the increase of the entry fee to
$100. In tha event of the nominators in
dorsing the idea, the Union Park Cours
inj; Association will add $3600, which will
make a total of $10,000, or $2000 more than
the English Waterloo, the world's great
est coursing event. The division of the
purse will be so arranged that all but
eight of the sixty-four entries will get
back their entrance money.
To the pessimistic ones in the game the
Increase for entrance will be something
to harp on, but the fact that for last
year's event there were seventy-two ap
plicants for <Uhe sixty-four nominations
makes it a certainty that there will be
an owner added for any that drops out.
Of the 2G0 puppies listed for this year's
Futurity Stake first payment was made
for 106 and second payment for eighty
one. Final payment will be due on the
night of the draw. jDogs of the following
kennels were dropped after first payment:

TV v 0T " t0 the hÂ° urds '-" hut " t0 th<v
l^k I paper!" is the cry that will re-
I X*a sound through the hills back of
A : N San Rafael on Saturday afterr
noons for the next few months.
The paper chase has become society's out
door pastime at San Rafael and its most
Interesting feature Is the presence of a
number of clever horsewomen, who take
as much fun and sport out of riding as
the most seasoned horseman! In fact, so
ciety â the feminine portion of it â Is de
voting a fair â¢ part of Its athletically
bestowed time to equestrianism, and it
is no uncommon Eight to see the most
adept and hardy and spirited of the wo
men riders galloping across country, tak
ing a ditch or an obstacle for the mere
pleasure and excitement of it without a
thought of danger or physical distress. â¢
During the last two or threfc years there
has been a great increase in the popular
ity of riding In San Francisco and the
number of women who aspire to do more
SOCIETY HORSEWOMEN RIDE CROSS COUNTRY
AND FOLLOW THE PAPER TRAIL IN MARIN
than just sit on a horse and look grace
ful Is much greater than It used to be.
It Is a fact that the good riders here, as
they are the world over, are nearly all
women in society, and most of them are
women who have ridden from their youth.
- Among the best society horsewomen in
California Is Miss Flora Deane, now Mrs.
Walter Magee. Mrs. RIagee could man
age a really difficult horse. She used to
ride a powerful thoroughbred named Bay
Dick. . â¢ ,
Miss Olive Holbrook, who rode with
Miss Deane, is also an exceedingly dar
ing rider. The more spirited the ani
mal the more she is pleased. Miss Ethel
Tomkins of San Rafael is both a good
rider and driver. She has always ridden
and always has some good horses. She
and Mrs. James Follis ride and drive a
great deal together. Miss Tomkins breaks
her own horses and'is an exceedingly good
judge of horseflesh. Mrs. Follis seems to
fancy a spirited pony more than the con
ventional, well-bread lady's hack. Miss
Eleanor Morrow, also of San Rafael, is
an exceedingly pretty and sympathetic rid
er and ought to be mentioned among those
who really ride well. So ought Miss Nel
lie , Woolrich of San Francisco.
Miss Oge is well known as a rider of
more than ordinary excellence. Although
she rides in a careless way, she has
shown that she can do something over
the rough country. Her success In the
paper chases has always been of a posi
tive kind. Another paper chase rider is
Mrs. Vincent Neale. Mrs. Neale ride3
as if she may have followed the hounds.
1 She gets down on her horse and carries
her hands in the true sporting fashion,
which is seldom seen with any but cross
country riders.
The smartest looking women on a horse
in San Francisco are Mrs. Joseph Tobin
and Mrs. W. Hobart. Mrs. Tobin has a
carriage and manner on horseback which
demand favorable comment. Both she
and Mrs. Hobart would be noticeable for
their good appearance anywhere.
Riding as a snort for women is in Its
infancy in the West, but it promises to be
the favorite amusement of the leisure
classes in the future.
There is an old saying that It takes
seven generations to make a gentleman,
and three to make n horseman, but your.?
Calif ornian riders are setting the pace.
and accomplishing at a bound what it
takes generations to do in the Old World.
Some of the fair sex are certainly becom
ing decidedly good horsewomen. To many
it is growing Into habit, instead of a la
bored accomplishment. They all ride in
the English fashion, and upon EnglU^
saddles, except those little girls, who ride
astride upon Shetland or Hungarian
ponies. Remarkable for their fearless ris
ing and their Hungarian ponies are the
children of A. W. Foster of San- Rafael.
They ride and drive these ponies four and
even six In hand, making themselves
formidable rivals of Miss Alice Hoffman
who is considered a crack whip, and gen
erally drives four little thoroughbreds to
a mountain wagon.
A certainly very good rider, a Miss JefT
reys of New York, Is riding at the Hotel
Rafael this year. Her riding at the last
paper chase, which she won, was very
clever. It is said she has -hunted. Her
seat and general carriage on horseback
seem to bear this out.

Potwollopers.
The Parliamentary register- for 1896
showed that there was then only one pot
walloper in all England. One seeing: the
term for the first time might easily Im
agine that a potwalloper waa a' species of
Ichthyosaurus or some other reptile of a
past age. It will be discovered upon In
quiry, however, that the term â¢.â¢potwal
loper" Is literally one who boils a pot, and
was applied to voters in certain boroughs
of England.- where before . the passage of
the reform bill of 1832 the. qualification for
suffrage was to have boiled (walloped) his
own pot in the parish for six months.â

Men whom the lust of office does not kill,
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,
Men who possess opinions and a will;
Men who have honor, men who will not
lie;
Men who can stand before a demagogue
And damn his treacherous flatteries with
out winking!' .

NOTES OF THE GAME
The Germans played like men who have
had a bad night. Their eyes were full of
fog and their movements were as. erratic
as the late Mr. Tyler's decisions. ;
Charlie Graham's sister was looked upon
as a mascot until . yesterday's game.
Whenever she graced a game the Ger
mans were sure of victory. '
Whalen was an easy mark- for the An
gels. In five innings they landed 'on him
for twelve good bumps. "Chlmmle". seem
ed to be disheartened" and put them over
with ease. The balls sailed over the plate
as balloons and the visitors helped- their
reverse flight by good stickwork. Â¦ . -
Oscar Jones had great speed and held
the hits down to a scattering few. He
was given faultless support by his team.
Shortstop Kelly has developed into a
clever and useful player. His work with
Los Angeles has been of high order. /
Householder and Bowman. did the bat
ting for Los Angeles. The former landed
safely every time up but once.
Graham was in bad form yesterday. He
allowed two men to come home by a poor
throw to Pabst.
Bowman robbed "Helney" Krug of a
three~bagger by taking one . off the. left
field fence. The catch was such a bril
liant one that the left fielder was given
an ovation. Krug was disappointed.
Brockhoff also made a beautiful catch
in his corner.
Householder's work in center was as
good as at the bat. His circus catch of
Pabst's fly was a gem in a constellation
of pood ones. . ...
Los Angeles not only played in great
form yesterday but had Dame Fortune
with them. . ...
Graves' faulty decision in the fourth
gave the Angels a run that they did not
deserve. (
Joseph Chancellor, the millionaire oil
king of Bakersfield; John Mott, -Harry

CRICKET PLAY
AT SANTA
CRUZ.
Alameda's Eleven Will Meet
the Team of the Country
Club of the Seaside Town
A team of Alameda cricketers leaves the
city to-day on a visit to Santa Cruz and
will play to-morrow a pennant match
against the. eleven of .the Santa Cruz
Country Club. .The. Alameda representa
tives will be chosen from R. B. Hogue,
Harold Ward, Henry Ward, B. Bird, F.
J. Croll. W. Jl Richter, A. S. Willis, W.
G. Fortman, F. A. Stahl, G. I. Baugh, H.
N. Brown and V. Leebeck. Nearly all of
the above played in the Young America
team, which the Pacifies defeated so de
cisively lasf Sunday, so that the Santa
Cruz eleven ought to be able to dispose of
them, unless- Harold Ward should prove
particularly effective as a bowler and
Croll should make one of his high batting
scores. The Santa Cruz team will be
without the valuable services of H. H.
Cookson, A. G. Sheath and D. B. Bow
ley. Their eleven will be chosen from H.
F. Anderson, G. P. Butler, C. Banner, J.
F. Coope, E. D. Dickson, E. H. Day, w.
A. Fortescue, P. D. Gellatly, A. Jenkins,
F. W. Stansfeld, H. Thomas, W. Leet, J.
E. Jackson and W. M. Johnstone.
There will be a meeting of the Califor
nia Cricket Association at the Occidental
Hotel on Monday evening at 8 o'clock to
settle the conditions upon which some
prizes offered by First Vice President
J. Metalfe shall be -awarded. Another
matter which will be discussed is the
status of E. G. Sioman, who played last
Sunday for Old England against Young
America. It is said that his inclusion in
the team caused the representatives of
the Alameda Cricket Club to withdraw
from the match, and it is also further
hinted that the Alameda men believed
that a team to represent Old England
could *not be got together without them.
That the team was not only made up but
completely crushed the Young America
eleven, who last year beat the Old Eng
land teams In .which Alameda men were
Included, is said to be highly distasteful
to the wearers df tho blue and white.
Â¦CHICAGO, July 5.â Twenty-one disciple's
of John Alexander Dowie visited Evans
ton, a Chicago suburb, _ to-night and,'de
spite the efforts of the entire police force
of the place, a mob of 1000 people drove
them out of town. .
Several days. ago four of Dowle's mis
sionaries were egged and driven out of
Evanston, and to-night's visit of the
twenty-one was intended to convert the
people of Evanston and show them the
error of their ways. The Instant the
Dowieltes began their meeting they were
assailed with eggs, vegetables and other
missiles.
The guard of policemen was too small
to afford much protection, and the crowd
soon began to hustle the missionaries
along the street in a manner that looked
serious. Â¦Â¦ Chief of Police Knight called the
entire police force to the rescue, but It
Includes only thirty men, and was unable
to coue with the mob.. Several of the

â¢ Then, plunging into the water, he seemed
almost dazed for a moment, while his
brother, sitting on the bath steps, watched
the minute pass that he remained under
water. But Gardiner popped up quickly
and groped his way to the resting board.
Ten minutes later all the crew were out
again, and while "Bob" Cook of Yale and
scores of friends came to express sympa
thy the crew cheerily"declared that they
had given the Leanders all they had and
had never rowed in better form.
Dr. White said the crew came through
the ordeal as fine as possible, and Captain
Fllckwer said that, individually, the crew
did splendidly.
"I don't think there was any one man
worse than any other," the cockswain
said. "Our start was not as good as yes
terday, yet it was a fair start. The wind
was much against us, and in trying 'to
avoid puffy gusts I was afraid twice that
I might foul Leander. We were rowing
about forty all through, as near as -I can
gauge. We led a bit up to the end of the
island, but at Frawley they led by a few
feet, and we were never able to regain it."
"It was simply a matter of a r better
crew," declared both Hart and 'Ward.
"We think we have done better than any
other American crew, and though beaten
by the best crew In England we did "every
thing we expected except win."

The Statist, frankly discussing the prob

of its apparent inevitability, that Parlia

upon the treasury loan powers for use

and carrying on active war to July 31, will
leave an estimated surplus of Â£16,000,000
available for winding up the charges of
maintaining the present large force in

hostilities beyond July 31, at the present
rate of Â£1,500,000. a week, would wipe out
the entire surplus before October 15.
CHARGE TROOPS
WITH BARBARITY
HENLEY, England! July |5.-To the dis
appointment of all the Americans at Hen
ley, the Leander Rowing Club â¢ crew this
morning defeated the crew of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in the final heat for
the Grand Challenge cup. There was
bright sunshine and puffy cross winds
blew from the Bucks shore, slightly favor-
Ing the Leanders" station. The followers
of. the British crew evinced the greatest
confidence, and Leander money was every
where available, but this confidence never
exceeded anything beyond even money.
The Pennsylvanians' friends picked up
several hundred pounds, and a Philadel
phia; occupant of a houseboat Is said to
have Invested Â£500 In favor of his crew.
â¢ The â¢Pennsylvanlans reached their boat
house at U o'clock, apparently as fit as
possible, while many of the followers of
the red and blue showed marks of the In
tense strain of the final minutes. The crew
stripped, chatted â¢ and laughed as coolly
as though^ going out for ipractlce.

reached- in- 5 minutes 15 "seconds, with* the
Leanders a half-length ahead, which they
increased to" three-quarters'-. of *;a' length.
At .the Isthmian the Pennsylvanians made
a desperate spurt,' but it was of no avail,
and two men weakened perceptibly oppo
site the. grand stand. The Leanders; won
by a length in 7 minutes 4 4-5 seconds.
"It was a grand race," said Coach
Ward, as the Leanders crossed the finish,
line. "We were simply outrowed and
have no other explanation to make."
It was certainly the .best and most ex
citing tussle ever seen at Henley. There
was scarcely the advantage of three feet
in the Leanders' station.
The cheering for the contestants as
they struggled for the lead was terrific.
Even Henley had never befora heard such
wild applause as greeted the Pennsylva
nlans and the Leanders all down the
course, and the cheering was delirious
from the partisans of the Leanders as the
latter's boat crossed the line at the finish
ahead of the Pennsylvanlans. â¢
The Americans paddled slowly to the
raft* and took their boat out of the water.
Their appearance indicated that they had
had a hard fight. Stripping as quickly as
possible, the Pennsylvanians were soon in
the water for a swim.

Constitution, Independence
and Columbia Will Have
It Out Over Thirty Miles
NEWPORT, R. I.. July 5.-Prepa rations
are complete to-night for the great race
to-morrow between the Constitution. In
dependence and Columbia. The tmknown
quantity is the Columbia. Some say that
in her the limit of speed has been reached.
A famous New York Yacht Club man said
to-day that her captain. Charles Barr. la
the best racing skipper In the world, and
furthermore that he is now getting more
speed out of the Columbia than ever Ire
fore in her history. At all events, she is
a most admirable trial horse.
There has been much discussion this
afternoon and evening over the relative
measurements of the three yachts. As the
measurements stand the racing: length of:
the Constitution is 104.73 feet, Indepen
dence 103.35. Columbia 102.30. Thus in a
thirty-mile course the Constitution, the
largest boat of the' three, would allow the
Independence forty-four seconds and the
Columbia one minute and seventeen sec
onds, and the Independence would allow
the Columbia thirty-three seconds. Should
the result be very close it might be neces
sary to remeasure the Independence, as
Mr. Kyslop was not satisfied with the
water line measurement this morning on
account of some difficulties in getting the
tremendous overhang, which, by the way,
is the longest he ever measured In an ex
perience extending over many years.
The Independence left her moorings
about 1:35 o'clock this afternoon and stood
down the channel under mainsail, club
topsail, staysail and jib. When off Castla
Hill she broke out her tremendous spin
naker and with a good burst of speed,
went down toward Brentons Reef light
ship. When off the reef she took in her
spinnaker, came about and stood over
toward Narragansett Pier. Then she
hauled aft her sheets and started on a
five-mile beat up. the bay. Meanwhile the
Constitution, which had been lying at her
moorings all the morning with mainsail
and a new club topsail set. let go and
stood over for the Jamestown shore on
the starboard tack, Captain Rhodes appa
rently only jogging her along. Soon after
ward, however, he had everything draw
ing in proper form and the boat went
through the water at top speed in a light
northeast wind well down the channel. To
the leeward was the Independence, also
at her best speed, apparently; and also
on the starboard tack, but the Boston
boat was so far in the lee that It was not
possible to get any idea of their relative
speed qualities. The Independence was
given a good full and went througn the
water very fast, but the Constitution was
at the same time pointing much higher.
The little. brush was soon over and no one
was the wiser. Both boats shortly after
came to -their moerlngs. The Columbia
did not leave the harbor to-day.

How Wealth is Increased.
When John I>. Rockefeller modestly and
for the purpose of Illustrating his point
told" hla son's Bible claw that the cor
poration of which ho is the head had pnld
out J70O.0OO.00O In wages he did no more
than echo what Abram S. Hewitt once
tolrt an audience of worltlnKmen. say* the
Philadelphia Times. Mr. Hswltfs th*mÂ«
was' that no man can ama** groat wealth
by the aid of any Industry cr any Inven
tion without Increasing the wealth of the
world In far greater proportion than his
own was Increased. He Illustrated that
by speaking: of Sir Henry Bessemer as one
of the greatest of philanthropists; For
Bessemer'* process brought him ahout
$20,000,000. but It Increased the .wealth- of
the world, according to Mr. Hewitt's esti
mate, by a.* much aÂ» $1,000,000,000. and al
most every person, at least. In thÂ« civ
ilized world was directly or Indirectly ben
efited thereby.
Â¦ Edison once made a computation that
his Incandescent lamp supported 1.000.OX)
persons and increased the capital of the
world by nearly KOO.OOO.OOO. although hla
own bhare'ln that Invention was only a
little over $3,000,000. So too, the Inventions
of Westlnghouse. of Bell, have probably
Increased the wealth of the world by as
much as $1,000,000,000. and the two cor
porations, one identified ' by Westing
house's name and the other, of which Mr.
Coffin is the head, are paying several mil
lions every year, the proportionate wages
each one receives from this payment b*.

The .New York Sun, strangely enough, turns its
attention from things of the day to things of night,
which is a queer proceeding on the. part : of a.sun.-
Despairing of finding any counsel fitted for the work
ing hours of life, it tells the New Yorkers how to sleep
at night. One- would suppose the instruction would be
briefly thus: "Read the Sun and you will sleep"; but
no "sucJC curt phrase as that befits the subject The
Sun reviews various plans that have been proposed ior
producing sleep and finds none of them equal to the
exigencies of a hot night. It says the mechanical
tricks of repeating 'poetry or the multiplication table
won't work; that hot baths and hot milk are an old
story and are unsuited to the weather; that the plan of
taking exercise is bad, for no one would get out of
bed on a hot night to swing Indian clubs; that mus
cular relaxation and a mind emptied of thought can
hardly avail anything, since it would not be easy, to
get much more relaxed or limp than one is already
under the influence of the weather. After rejecting all
plans hitherto put forward, the Sun offers one ofjts
own. It says: "Let there be no clock or watch in. the
room. . Then you won't have to get up to see what
time it is. If you smoke, smoke a cigar in bed. Â¦ It is
an infallible means of inducing sleep for.some people.
There are many excellent fire insurance' companies,
and should anything happen you would never wake
The methods of treating the subject are various.
The Boston Globe says: "The lesson for sweltering
humanity when a hot wave surges over the length of
the land never was put more aptly than by the old
philosopher whose counsel was: 'Be easy, keep-easy;
and if you can't be easy, be as easy as you can.' " The
New York Press strives 'for a new consolation. It
says: "It would be sardonic for us to tell you to keep
cool when you can't keep cool, but we. venture to re
mind you that we have had it much warmer and that
you should be grateful now that it is not so warm as
it will be before the summer is over." By way of show
ing a complete cheerfulness, it adds: "The Press is
an optimist on all questions save the regeneration of
Tammany Hall; -therefore, we say to you that the
weather is particularly gracious in that it is uniform in
its markings of temperature from day to day. Life is
much more tolerable with an average thermometer
reading of 82 from Monday to Saturday than with the
mercury at 70 on Tuesday, at 95 on Wednesday, back
again to 70 and up to 96 again." ' y
WHILE the people of the East have been
sweltering and falling prostrate under the
tefrific pressure of heat and humidity, the
philosophers of the press have been discoursing wis
dom with all the serenity of gentlemen who never get
heated except at election times. They have been tell
ing their readers to go slow and think cool things;
have reminded them that hot weather is good for corn
and watermelons, and in other ways have sought to
persuade the sufferers that it will be worth while to
survive the heated spellso that they may be alive next
winter when the cooling blizzards blow.
PHILOSOPHY IN THE EAST.
The recent race of automobiles from Paris to Ber
lin caused so much disturbance along the roads that
the French Government has forbidden the driving
of the. machines hereafter along public highways at a
rate of speed faster than that permitted to horses.
The^rule may. hold for a time, but in the end it will
have to give way," for the automobile age cannot be
held back to the pace of the past
On the exclusion of coolie labor our people are a
unit On the exclusion of merchants they are not a
unit Is it useful, therefore, to so formulate the de
mand as to make us seem divided rather than united?
It must not be forgotten that we have the East to
deal with in this matter, and the coolie question there
is subordinated to the commercial aspect of the issue.
If we unify the demand for exclusion to include
coolies and merchants there is grave danger that we
may get no exclusion at all.
The reason for the exclusion law, and the only and
sufficient reason ever given for it, is that Chinese
coolie laborers compete on unequal terms with white
American labor to the peril of the latter. To go be
yond that reason in a demand for continuance of
exclusion is in danger, of bfcing taken as a confession
that it is not good and sufficient
chants our trade with China will have to be carried on
through the seaports of England or some other Euro
pean power. If we exclude Chinese merchants \ we
must not expect her to admit American merchants, so
that we cannot transfer the point of exchange to her
soil and send American merchants there to effect the
distribution. All expansion of foreign trade means
demand for the product of our domestic labor, which
implies steadier employment and wages. Any con
traction of foreign trade means the opposite of these.
In the exclusion of Chinese merchants we can see only
contraction, and if that view be correct we oppose
such exclusion as being opposed to the interest of
American labor and the growth and independence of
American commerce. Already one-third the tariff
revenues paid on this coast is upon the goods im
ported by Chinese merchants. At the existing rate of
increase it will soon be one-half the total revenue. If
they are forbidden commercial asylum here we know
of no means by vvliich this trade can be maintained.
It wilr be seen that if we exclude these mer-
SOME of the labor organizations, in their memor
ial for re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
law, demand that no Chinese except the Min
ister and Consuls and their necessary official force
shall be permitted in the country. This would ex
clude Chinese merchants and practically establish
commercial non-intercourse between the two coun
tries. To have trade with . China we must have the
means of distribution and exchange. We own no sea
ports on that coast England does not need resident
Chinese merchants, for she owns Hongkong as the
base of her commerce. So Portugal owns Macao,
Germany Kiaochau and Russia Port Arthur, while
France is entrenched in Tonquin. But we have no
such base. Our Chinese trade is largely controlled
by Chinese merchants resident in this country, who
practically establish the point of exchange here in
stead of upon their own coast. We say they control
this trade, which means that they created it. They find
in their own country a market for American goods,
and buy the goods here and ship them for distribu
tion.
TOO EXCLUSIVE EXCLUSION.
It is this change that isolates such failures as that of
the Seventh National, and minimizes or postpones the
consequences that may follow the great industrial cap
italizations. If one of these do break, it will be inter
esting to compare the results with those which fol
lowed the break of such a pigmy institution as the
Ohio Trust Company in 1857. .
But in respect to the National Treasury, there is a
change since 1893. Then the Harrison administration
had seen it run empty and the Cleveland administra
tion received it in collapse. Now the gold standard
is definitely established; the endless chain is cut, and
there is a Treasury surplus of nearly eighty millions.
Instead of being the first victim of a panic, the Treas
ury now is in a condition to put in practice the prin
ciple of first aid to the injured, financially.
There is no doubt that were our financial condi
tions the same as in 1893 the failure of the Seventh
National would have started a panic. The explosion
would have been felt in the United States Treasury,
and in scuttling for cover its gold would have been
drained and, the national credit imperiled. People
forget how in a panic they depend upon the verities
and not the fiction of value. When Phil Armour felt
the panic of 1893 coming, he did not increase his line
of credits, nor reach out for more paper securities. He
began systematically to get gold, and- did not stop un
til he had accumulated millions of it sufficient to carry
him through. Those who reached for collateral did
not get through.
If "the story told about the Seventh National Bank
of New York" and the broker Marquand is true, it
proves that the great industrial combinations have to
imperil themselves in trying to preserve the conditions
necessary to their credit. Marquand had undertaken,
to finance a coal road which would tap a region to be
operated in opposition to the coal combination. That
organization, to save its own credit, "found it neces
sary to destroy his, but in doing so it blew up a big
bank, and might have started a panic that would 'have
reacted upon its own securities and destroyed its own
credit. ... - *â¢Â¦..
I SPECULATIVE BANK FAILURES.
THE 'CALL has repeatedly warned the country
that the furor for speculation, which always
accompanies good times, was likely to go to
suchextremes as to cause disastrous failures and make
the conditions for a panic The panic of 1857 came
out of a clear sky and ensued upon a long period of
prosperity. Its proximate cause was a speculative con
fidence in the rapidity of Western development The
Ohio Trust Company had invested and speculated in
Western credits, and. values had been inflated beyond
a sound limit. Naturally that company had become
the agent or trustee of moneyed concerns farther East,
and when it found itself unable to carry its speculative
load it fell and dragged credit and confidence down
with it. There has been a well-grounded fear that
the immense capitalizations of industries would repeat
the conditions of 1857. The financing of "these great
combinations involves a large number of institutions,
which hold collateral that will perhaps shrink with
prices. On a" rising or stable market such securities
are good, but they rapidly lose their integrity if prices
fluctuate lower. It remains to be seen whether even
such a colossal combination as the Steel Trust can
stand- the hardship of a falling market and decreased
consumption. It must not be taken for granted that
such organizations are immortal and immune to the
causes which affect credit. Â¦ When financing them
has strained all the strong banks in the country, none
remain to come to the rescue of their credit, for the,
strong are already under them and the weak can only
take care of themselves.

POWER OF A SONG.
Foster's "Old Folks at Home" is the
most popular song in existence. It has
been- translated into all the languages of
Europe and also into some j of Asia and
the isles of the sea. The lines are. poetic
only in the sense of suggestion; they are
so simple and artless that it -would seem
that any school child could pen them and
improve upon them, but they express the
sentiment of every homesick man or
woman that ever lived. Compared . with
"The . Old Folks at Home," Kiplins's
"Mandalay," .which has been said by
some high authorities to be the acme cf
homesick expression, is a disgusting emul
sion of beer and sensuality. There is an
oft- told story of a regiment ~ of trocps,
with pay overdue four months, that was
overtaken by the paymaster just as it
reached a camp near, a great city in which
everything was "wide open." Many of
the men, with their pockets full of money,
"broke guard" and returned to camp in
a condition prejudicial to good order and
military discipline. The guard themselves
became untrustworthy, good men though
they had been on.tho march and in battle;,
the sober members of the regiment strove
unsuccessfully 'to restrain the uncontrolla
ble, and- the colonel gravitated between
slaughter, andf suicide, when suddenly the
leader of the band asked permission to
try his hand . on the disturbing element.
Grouping his' musicians in the center, of
the. camp he started "The Old Folks at
Home," and played unceasingly for half
an' hour, when the officer of. the guard
reported that the camp was entirely .quiefT

The rule Which the officers of the association have
thus voluntarily imposed upon themselves is unques
tionably a good one. The Merchants' Association
would soon lose its influence among the people, a
considerable number of its members and a large part
of its power for good if it undertook to advance the
interests of any particular candidates or to set up can
didates of its own. It is now a powerful' and use
ful organization, and has" rendered effective service
to the community in promoting many forms of mu
nicipal improvement," but it has managed to do all that
solely because the people- believe, its officers and :
members ' are not seeking . personal ends. President
Symmes is therefore- right. in saying a- taint of poli
tics; would ruin .'its. influence. -ItwilU doubtless be
gratifying to ,the members .tor receive this [clear and
emphatic statement from-the president; and the grati
fication will be shared- by the community at large.
PRESIDENT SYMMES of the Merchants' As
sociation announces in the current number of
the Association Review that "there is an un
written and absolute law that. this association cannot
aid any- one to office or take a partisan stand in elec
tions.". He goes on to say: "Its principles are em
bodied,in measures, not men. . It seeks to obtain the
best results from' the conditions the voters give us.
It is' a voluntary aid to good government. A taint
of politics would ruin itsinfluence. Its freedom from
it, and the thoroughly .unselfish spirit of its workers,
have established a high standard in the past," and it
must maintain the same for the future."

A revision of the game laws so that their exclusive
features are eliminated and that good food need not be
destroyed because the planet has made one more revo
lution would preserve game just as well, while per
mitting its. enjoyment, lawfully, to more people.
It is a poor comment upon the intelligence of the
law makers that the use of all game carried into the
close season is forbidden, to the loss of its possessor
and of those who need it for food. We are aware that
it will not do to supply the hunters with a motive for
over-killing during the season, to enable the dealers
to carry over a stock. But "this -can be 'â¢ avoided by
limiting'. the quantity of each kind of game that may
be carried over, so as to cover a legitimate surplus. '
There is too much tendency to so frame our game
laws as to make it possible for only an exclusive few
to take game at all. Those who. need it for food are
deprived of some of the best varieties, for its -sale is
prohibited. There is no less of such game taken, but
its use is exclusive and the general public is practically
prohibited. To them it is forbidden fruit. As much
game is taken every year as if those fond of it were
permitted to buy it in the market, so that the effect
upon game preservation is no better than if sale and
use were, permitted.
The result of this law is that any game left in the
hands of a dealer at the end of the season must be
thrown away and destroyed. J It is a waste that makes
the act of taking the game almost a sin. . There is but
one reason for taking game, and that is its use. -,To
take .birds for their plumage alone and animals' for
their skins is an offense, because it' implies a waste of
food or a disturbance of the equilibrium of nature.
THE season approaches in which, the. hunter. of
big game is interested 'in the game laws of.Cal
ifornia. They are complicated in respect to the
open and close season for; certain game, the date dif

laws is common to them j we believe, in all the game
States. They. all proyidej penalties of ithe severest.na

open season, though it_.may be proved to have beeir
taken when to take it was lawful. â¢ ;

is the disinclination 'of Crear to sell his farm, although he has
expressed a hope that the plan may become a reality. Should
Crear decide to keep the farm he will offer the free use oi it
for the building of a home for ex-slaves. The logs comprising
the original cabin in which the ex-President was born, which
are at present on exhibition at the Pan-American Exposition,
will be brought back to the farm and erected on the site of its
original location. Thomas -says that log cabins similar to that
In which Lincoln was born will be built all over the farm for
the homes of the ex-slaves, and that a fine building will be
erected In the center for headquarters. The original cabin will
not be used for habitation, but a magnificent bust of Lincoln,
will be made and erected in the center of the cabin. Additional
land will be purchased and cultivated to supply provisions for
the ex-slaves. - . Â¦

: ; In speaking about the war in South Africa in, a re
cent address, Lord Salisbury called it '"a great crisis,"
and said: "We are defending the King's territory
against invasion by neighbors who, in international
law, had no just complaint against "us." That is one
way of putting it, but it doesn't accord with- the gen
eral understanding of the facts.
Perhaps there is no better consolation available than
that- When it once gets into the head of the New
Yorker that he is becoming used to the heat he will
be ableÂ»to bear it with something of equanimity. In
fact, some generations from now there may be a
species of human salamander. inhabiting the city who
will really like the heat and 'humidity and who will
advertise. their locality as the only summer resort in
the world where one can. have free Russian baths
without having to leave his rooms. ' Â¦ '..-
The 'New York Times cheers .the public by arguing
the average New Yorker doesn't suffer from heat
Â¦as much as he used to. It says that about thirty years
ago "it was necessary in Â¦â¢' midsummer to establish
emergency hospitals in the Citv Hall". and elsewhere
for the victims of the too ardent sun, and the news
papers published daily lists that filled several columns
and read like the reports sent home after a great
battle. Nowadays a brief, paragraph usually suffices,
and yet the weather is just as hot, and the humidity
just as high, as they used to be. The increased power
of resistance to heat shown by the city's population
seems mysterious at first thought, but it is doubtless
due to the same causes that have lowered the general
death rate â to the improved conditions of life, and to
the better personal habits,, especially as regards eating
and drinking." / .' / :

CINCINNATI, July 5.-Four men were
fatally* and three others seriously injured
by a natural gas explosion In pit No. 1 of
the series of shafts of the New "Water
works at Torrence road to-day. Those fa
tally injured are: Martin McLaughlln,
James O'Brien, Robert Barnet and James
Bryant.
Fatally Injured in a Mine Pit.
At the autopsy It was found that the
fatal shot passed through the child's right
arm below the elbow, and entering the
stomach two lncheB to the right of the
medial line passed through the liver and
kidneys and lodged against the spine ono
inch below tho lnst rib.
The autopsy held last night at the
Morgue elicited facts tending to prove
that it was from Wilson's revolver *that
the fatal shot was fired. The cartridges
whjch were extracted from Wilson's
weapon after it had been found in the
cellar were coated with verdigris. Verdi
gris also covered the bullet which was re
moved from the child's body during the
autopsy. The bullet is a thirty-eight cali
ber and corresponds with the bullets
which were in Wilson's revolver.
Wilson Joined the police force April 27,
1880. At that time he was 40 years of age
and an engineer by occupation. He was
attached to the southern division on De
cember 9. 1889, when he resigned. Decem
ber 17, 1888, he was fined $50 by the Police
Commissioners for neglect of duty, and
November 18, 18S9, he was reprimanded by
the Commissioners on a charge of being
intoxicated while on duty.
Policeman Smith Carr, who Is a gun ex
pert, examined Wilson's revolver yester
day afternoon, and said it had been re
cently fired, as" shown by the powder
marks In the muzzle.
The unfortunate girl died shortly after
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon and the
body was removed to the Morgue. A3
soon as the police were notified, Wilson
was booked at the City Prison on a charge
of murder. When informed of the girl's
death he said he was sorry, but declined
to say anything further, as he- had been
instructed by his attorney, ex-Judge
Bahrs, to keep silent. Prior to the girl's
death he denied shooting her. He said he
tock his revolver, which was kept In the
cellar, to try it, as it had not been in
use for some time: that he tired at a
board In the fence and not at any human
being; that he had never made any
threats against the children in the neigh
borhood, although they had been raising,
a disturbance around there for a long
time, and that, as four or five boys were
firing off revolvers Thursday night, tho
girl might have been shot by a bullet from
one of their revolvers. ,
â¢5 -;?
morning on the charge of assault to mur
der, lie was Instructed as to his rights
and the case was continued till July, as
the child was then still alive.

SUCCUMBS TO HER WOUNDS
Ex-Policeman Robert Wilson, Accused of
Shooting the Giri, Is Booked on a Gharge
of MurderâGrief of the Victim's Mother
%
DENVER, July 5.â A calm prevailed to
day over the scene of "Wednesday's trou
ble with the striking miners employed in
the Smuggler-Union mine near Telluride,
Colo. The latest Information concerning
the situation there came to Governor Or
man this evening: from Sheriff Dowtaln
and was contained In a telegram which
read as follows:
"There has been no violence or property
destroyed since the 3d. - 1 do not think- 1
can protect life and property in case of
riot. It Is usually done before one knows
it."
Governor Orman was very much re
lieved by the receipt of the above mes
sage, for ha feared that there might be
an outbreak before his commission could
arrive In Telluride and take the matter in
hand.
Mine Manager Collins* reply to the ulti
matum of the strikers, in which he prac
tically declined to accept their terms and
Intimated that it would be necessary to
shut down the Smuggler-Union indefinite
ly If their demands were persisted in, was
the most important development in the |
situation to-day. The final demands of
the miners and the refusal of the manager
to accede to them makes it appear useless
for either side to further present its
claims, and there appears to be no chance
for an amicable settlement of the differ
ences of the contending parties until the
Governor's commission takes a hand.
This commission, unless it was delayed,
arrived In Telluride late this afternoon,
and it is expected that it will lose no
time in conferring with the representa
tives of the Miners' Union at Telluride.
One thing it is Instructed to demandâ a
surrender of the property now held by the
strikers. If this is not done at once the
Governor has instructed the commission
to say to the strikers' representatives that
possession will be secured for the owners
of the property even if it Is necessary to
call into the service the entire National
Guard of the State.
The feeling between the strikers and
the managers of the Smuggler-Union Is
very bitter, and it is feared that it will
not be an easy matter to Induce the men
to retire from the property. However,
Governor Orman was particular to select
men in whom the labor element has confi
dence in making up his commission, and
it may be that representations coming
from men whom the strikers hold as their
friends will- induce them to retire and
await an amicable settlement of their
claims. .
State- Labor Commissioner James T.
Smith, who has been investigating the
conditions at the Smuggler-Union mine,
returned to Denver to-day. He left Tellu
ride before the outbreak occurred. Speak
ing of the affair he said:
"Of course, the miners were wrong in
firing and entering the mine. In fact, It
might be called unjustifiable. But the
I management is not blameless. The strike
! would have besn settled long ago if the
company had shown a disposition to treat
the employes fairly."
The commission sent to Telluride, Colo.,
by Governor Orman to try and effect a
settlement of the strike at the Smuggler-
Union mine, wired to-night from that
place as follows:
"Conditions here are ouiet and seem
favorable for settlement. Conflicting ele
ments are In conference and there is ab
solutely no immediate danger to either
! life or property. We aFe just going to
I the scene of trouble at the mines with
I Manager Colling, and will send further in
i formation as speedily as possible."
Governor Orman left the State House
about 11 o'clock for his home, and should
any further communications be received
from Telluride it is not likely that they
will be given out to-night.

of tho work of his olllco during the past
two years, showing that tho arrivals of
Chinese at this port have diminished by
more than one-half. The figures are more
oloauent than words:

BARRING OUT _
OF THE CHINESE
"She was hardly two minutes out of my
sight." the mother kept repeating and re
peating, "when they came and told me she
was shot. She had helped me with the
dishes and after the kitchen was all tidied
up I put her in a clean frock and gave her
permission to go in front of the door to
shoot off her 10 cents' worth of firecrack
ers. I went and sat at the door with her.
After she had shot off her firecrackers she
begged permission to go to the corner,
where there was a bonfire burning. I told
her she might go. Not ten minutes later
the whole street was crying out 'Maggie
1b shot.'
"She was too good for me," went on
the unhaopy mother. "Her eyes were so
big and brown, her skin so transparent.
She looked like a rich child."
Mrs. Hartwell has an idea that if she
were the possessor of unlimited means she
might perhaps have saved the life of her
loved one. She is not ignorant of the fact
that her child had done for her all that
science and skill and kindness could.
Neither Is the unhappy mother ungrate
ful; only she wishes that she might have
flung gold broadcast in fruitless efforts
to save her dear one'a life. .^
Mrs. Hartwell's grief Is noble. There are
tears and sighs and wild lamentation for
the departed little soul, but not one harsh
word for the white-haired man who took
the life of her child.

street on the evening of the
Fourth, is dead. She passed away
shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon. The end came peacefully. Earlier
in the day the little patient suffered con
siderably and sobbingly called out for her
mother to ease the awful pain. A dose
of morphine quieted the little sufferer and
made her last moments easy. .,,â,-Â¦,
Mrs. Hartwell, the girl 's widowed
mother, was constantly at thÂ© child s bed
side. Her sorrow was most pathetic. Her
wild paroxysms of grief were followed by
a terrible calm that was even more pitiful
than her heart-rending sobs and sighs.
Her face was drawn, her eyes Inflamed
and swollen -and her voice strained and
hoarse. At 3 o'clock on Thursday morn
ing the physicians and nurses in attend
ance at the hospital induced her to leave
the little sufferer and go to her desolate
little home. - ..
"Your cries are not good for tne pa
tient," they told her and 6he went away,
only to return with the break of day,
Â¦when sho begged to be allowed to resume
her place at the bedside of her dying

SAN RAFAEL, July 5.â Considerable
excitement was caused in this city to-day
over the disappearance of Lucy Alberti,
the 16-year-old daughter of Joseph Alberti,
proprietor of the William Tell House, on
B street.
The girl left home yesterday afternoon
to attend the picnic at San Rafael Park.
She was seen thera later In the afternoon.
Since then her whereabouts is a mys
tery. She did not return home and her par
ents are nearly distracted over her ab
sence.
When seen to-night the parents claimed
to have discovered her whereabouts, but
refused to speak further. This is doubted,
as the officers have in no way relaxed
their efforts to find her. One rumor has it
that she was seen on Fourth street alter
11 o'clock last night and that she took the
northbound broad gauge train this, morn
ing. The youth of the girl, together with
her past conduct, incline the officers to
ridicule tlie theory that there Is a man in
the case.

of Sclborcie, First Lord of the Admiralty,
in a statement on the present naval posi

mainder of the year 1901 would witness
the completion of three armored cruisers
of the Cressy class, four first class bar
bette ships of the class of the Formidable
p.r.C two first class barbette ships of the
Atlas class. ...
The Secretary of the Admiralty also
said there was an absolute determination
on the part of the Admiralty to find the
best type of boiler, and the Government
v.as watching with interest a German ex
periment of combining cylindrical and
water tube boilers In the same shio.
The cruisers will be of 9S00 tons and will
have a speed of twenty-three knots. Their
arirament will be heavier than the Mon
mouth's. It is believed that the cruisers
which are about to be laid down will be
oqual to anything likely to be brought
asainst them. The now torpedo-boat de
s;royers will be of strong construction.
Jn regard to hospital ships, the Secre
tary cf the Admiralty said Great Britain

! Su Shih Chin, a proscribed enemy of the
Dowager Empress of China, was admitted
to this country yesterday by order of the
Secretary of. the Treasury, which reached
the office of Customs Collector Stratton
yesterday by telegraph. Chin was at large
on bonds pending the hearing of his peti
tion on habeas corpus in the United
States District Court. The bonds have
been declared exonerated, and the habeas
corpus proceedings will be dismissed.
It is understood that Su will remain in
this city for some time, collecting funds
from Chinese patriots to assist the pend
ing revolution In favor of the restoration
of the deposed Emperor Kwang Hsu. Re
former Su will argue the cause of the Em
peror in the columns of the Chinese
World, a dally paper published on Dupont
street In the. interest of the revolution.
He is a college graduate, being a Bachelor
of Arts from the Peking University. Min
ister Wu Ting Fang at Washington
and his nephew, Consul General Ho
Yow, at this port, protested against the
landing of the revolutionist and alleged
that he had secured his passport from a
taotai at Shanghai by false representa
tions, and that if the taotai had known
Chin's character and identity he would
not have issued the passport.
The Secretary of the Treasury decided
that this Government could not debar
Chinese Immigrants of the favored classes
because of political offenses. ,

The deceased was 24 years of age. A
brother resides in this city and the rest
of the family near St. Helena. It has been
said that the young man was despondent
over a disappointment In love, but the
men who worked with him for the City
Street Improvement Company say this 13
not true. They seem to think that young
Juarez was mentally unbalanced when he
went to his death.
The father of the deceased is a prosper
ous rancher in Napa County. The young
man came to the city two years ago, and
in December, 1899, went to work for the
City Street Improvement Company and
continued In its employ until June 26 last.
He was then taken sick and became very
melancholy. He feared that he had lost
his position, and the letter he threw on
the deck of the Piedmont was an answer
to one from him asking if he might return
to work.
The Piedmont passed right over the
body .and one of the paddles must have
struck it, for when it came up astern
mere v/a^ no motion. A boat was lowered,
but before it could reach the spot the body
went down. Nothing save tne hat was
recovered from the suicide. The letter
thrown on the deck was addressed to Wil
liam Juarez and was signed by the super
intendent of the City Street Improvement
Company. It showed that the deceased
had left the company's employ because of
ill health, that his standing with the con
cern was very high and that he could re
turn to work at any time.
The Piedmont left the Oakland slip at
12:25 p. m., and a number of people noticed
a young man pacing the forward deck in
a very excited manner. He was talking
to himself and gesticulating, but no one
thought anything of it. Suddenly . he
waved his arms and saying something in
Spanish rushed through the crowd of peo
ple who were watching him. He got un
der the chain that prevents passengers
Â¦ from going too far forward, and then
pausing long enough to throw a letter on
the deck he plunged into the bay.
A young man named William Juarez
jumped from the lower deck of the ferry
boat Piedmont yesterday, and although
every effort was made to save him he
sank before help came.
Very Despondent.

Judg-e Dunne Appoints Guardians for
Person and Estate of Aged
Boswell Lee.
After sixty-four years of fruitless toil
Roswell Lee, formerly an accountant in
the Occidental Hotel, has come into pos
session of a small fortune, but owing to
his weakened mind a guardian must man
age his properties during the few years
of life that remain to him. Judg-e Dunne
yesterday gTanted petitions for letters of
guardianship upon his person and estate
after listening to a statement made by
General W. H. L. Barnes, who was a boy
with the aged ward in Springfield, Mass.
"Roswell Lee came here sixteen years
ago from the home of our boyhood," said
General Barnes. "He came consigned to
me and I paid the freight and since then
most of the storage. He was formerly an
accountant in the Occidental Hotel, but he
never prospered. He is now in the first
stages of paresis, due to excessive dissi
pation of all kinds. He is now ill and has
not long to live.
"Not long ago he fell heir to $18,000. I
have invested some of this money for
him, the rest he has divested himself of.
iie new lives at California and Polk
fc..eets. where he Is' under the care of a
physician.
"His family was well known throughout
the East. It is an old New England fam
ily and can trace its history back to the
time of the Mayflower. But his family
relations aided him but little, save that
now he has inherited this money, which
he is too old and feeble to enjoy, but
which will keep him from want in his
declining years."
Judge Dunne appointed "William E.
Ivovejoy guardian of Lee's person and the
Union Trust Company guardian of his es

it Captain John Ross is confident
that he has the hull located, and
will begin work as soon as he can perfect
arrangements. He has chartered the gas
oline schooner Bessie K, purchased the
interests of the insurance companies in
the tin which composed part of the cargo
and secured a lien on other valuable mer
chandise in the hull, and just as soon as
the diving outfits can be procured and the
tides suit the work will begin.
Associated with Captain Ross in the
venture Is Madame Young, the spiritual
ist. Captain Plummer. who died years
ago, was Madame Young's father, and his
spirit is supposed to have pointed out
where the wreck lay. Gould, the oil
broker, is also financially interested, and
then there is J. J. Sullivan, Tom Olsen
and James McLaughlin. - These people are
confident that they have located the
wreck and that a fortune awaits them,
but then Wrecker Whitelaw says he also
has located the wreck, and that it is an
altogether different position than where
Ross places It.
Not a Suicide.
The harbor police are investigating what
has the appearance of a suicide. Yester
day a hat and coat were found on Beale
street wharf. When the coat was searched
a poll tax rec2ipt and an order for the
payment of $35 was found in the inside
pocket. Both were In the name of P.
Cavanaugh. The order was on the Stand
ard Electric Company, and showed that
Cavanaugh had been working for that
concern at Amador.
The natural Inference was that Cava
naugh had committed suicide, but an In
quiry at the Standard works showed that
he had been there and stopped payment
of the order, stating that it and some
other papers had been stolen from him.
Detectives Egan and Ellis were detailed
on the case, and they soon discovered
that Cavanaush had gone to the water
front to cool off. He sat down on a
stringier and took off his coat and hat.
When he had rested he walked home,
leaving both articles behind him.
The Hayden Printing: Cojnpany has ad
dressed a letter to the Mayor in reference
to the furnishing of books to the various
departments of the city and county gov
ernment for the fiscal year. In which it Is
alleged that a combination was formed
to get the J>ook work. The letters avers
that: "Our belief Is based upon certain
happenings of which we have positive
knowledge. When we offered our bids we
were not aware of the existence of this
combination, and the fact that our bids
were on the whole about 33 1-3 per cent
lower than those made by others showed
pood faith on our part. After the Lids
were opened special inducements were of
fered us to withdraw our bids for books.
To this we gave an unqualified refusal."
The bids of the Hayden Printing Com
pany were thrown out after the contract
to the Hayden Company had been adver
tised, the company being the lowest bid
der. This has also found place in the let
ter to the Mayer, v.ho is asked to inter
pose to "secure a prompt and full recon
sideration in the interest of good faiih
and fair play in municipal affairs."
The letter to the Mayor is rather splcv
In places. One paragraph Is as follows:
"We contend that the offer of a written
guarantee that was presented to the hon
orable Board of Supervisors to supply the
city and county with the goods in ques
tion (books) at a saving- of $3000. if all
bids should be thrown out, is not made in
good faith. In the first place it is irregu
lar, which is of importance in this con
sideration. It was not accompanied by
any bond or other security which would
make it binding."
Bad faith is also alleged in one para
graph:
"As to the bad faith Involved in the of
fer, we have to say that it is evident to
us. If Phillips & Smythe were sincere
why d!d they not submit a bid in the reg
ular way, at the proper time, with this
difference in their prices? One year ago
they, being solely printers in the same
sense as our firm, bid on the items in the
book schedule. They were awarded the
contract for some seventy items. The con
ditions attending thÂ« bidding were the
same as those of the present vear. If
printers could bid for the books in 1900
and get the contract without protest,
what has happened that makes the ac
ceptance of .bids from printers illegal in
15C1? Surely Phillips & Smythe cannot
claim that they thought that they were
not entirred to bid."
The knowledge that the Mayor has been
asked to act has stirred up a great deal of
interest among the bookbinders and print
'ers. Bids are now being prepared to sub
mit to the Supervisors in place of . the
bids rejected.

The bodies of Operator Sherry and
Mamie Sullivan, who were drowned while

Sherry's body was found near the en
trance to Vallejo harbor about two miles
from where the accident occurred. The
body of Lliss Sullivan wae discovered also
near Vallejo by some men working on the
Southern ParfSc dredger.
Coroner McDonald held an inquest, and
a verdict of accidental death was ren
dered in both cases.

The Republican leaders are just now fig
uring on apportionment for the primaries.
Whether to base the delegates upon the
number of votes cast for McKlnley at the
last election or upon those cast for Gage
at the election two years ago is what is
troubling them, and also whether" to have
one delegate for every one hundred votes
or one delegate for every two hundred
votes. It seems to be ihe opinion of most
of the prominent men in the party that
the convention should â¢ not be of more
than two hundred and fifty or three hun
dred delegates, and the apportionment
will probably start with this as a basis,
in which case it will make little difference
whether it be based on the State or gen
eral election. The scheme of Kelly and
Crimmins to have one delegate for every
precinct and three at large from each d it-
virtue of his chairmanship In the parent
committee.
There was a meeting of the Republicans
of the Thirty-sixth District at the head
quarters last evening for the purpose of
effecting a temporary organization. There
were more than one hundred present. The
organization started with these tempo
rary officers: J. E. Barber, president:
Gustav Schnee, vice president: H. C.
Pearce, secretary: J. B. Mahoney, treas
urer. The president was authorized to
appoint a committee composed of one
member from each of the twenty-two pre
cincts in the district to bring the Repub
licans together and into the club.
The organization of the Thirty-sixth
was in pnnsuance of a plan to organize
at least one of the districts every night
at the headquarters. A temporary organ
ization is effected in the headquarters and
then a permanent organization is created
in the district.
PRIMARY APPORTIONMENT NOW MOST '
VEXING QUESTION FOR REPUBLICANS
trict will not go through. Such a plan
would but magnify the Kelly and Crim
mins power, for a careful Inspection
will show that their districts will bo
represented by about four times as many
delegates as the same number of voters
in other sections of the city. It is a neat
scheme but It will not go through.
Monday night the Republican County

Revenge is the doubtful pleasure of a

Some action will be taken at once to
stop the "barber college" evil. It is a
matter that the State Board of Barber
Examiners has until the present had no'
opportunity to investigate, but the per
sonal Investigation made yesterday by
Mr. Calish will soon result in the adop
tion of drastic measures.
The greatest evil with which the barbers of
this State have to contend, and an evil which
at one time threatened the complete demoraliz
ation of the trade, is the so-called barber
school. Minnesota, has but one of these in
stitutions, which is located in Minneapolis. It
is a branch of what is called "The Moler Sys
tem of Barber and Hairdressing Colleges.'*
Similar branches are located at Chicago. St
Louis, Cincinnati and New York, with head
quarters at Chicago. The place is filthy be
yond description. The stairs, hallways, operat
ing-room, chairs, floor, i walls, workstands.
cups, brushes, towels, in fact everything in
and about the place, were so filthy that the
appearance Is distasteful, even sickening, to
a person who has any notion of cleanliness.
In its last biennial report the Barbers'
State Board of Examiners of Minnesota
in describing the condition of the so-called
barber colleges had this to say regarding
their condition, and it most aptly fits the
local conditions discovered yesterday:
Minnesota View of the Evil.
At the San Francisco Barber College,
741A Howard street, of which W. H. Dun
nagan is the proprietor, the same condi
tions obtain. One young man. evidently ill
of consumption, waa shaving a veteran of
the steam-joint route. He was in a con
dition almost bordering on collapse, and
as the law makes specific provision for
such cases he was told to call at the
headauarters of the State Board of Bar
ber Examiners.
After the student graduates he is furn
ished with a diploma entitling him to
work at his profession in any shop in the
United States affiliated with the college.
He generally retains his place for a short
time and is discharged to make room for
a new graduate.
San Francisco Lodge Xo. 3 of the Inde
pendent Order of Odd Fellows celebrated
Its golden jubilee last evening in the Cov
enant Hall of the Odd Fellows' building.
Old Purity, as the lodge is known, was
instituted In 1S51 and had for its officers:
Samuel H. Parker, P. G.; Jesse Booring,
X. G.; Philo White, V. G.; R. O. Sturte
vant, R. S-; J. Joseph. F. S.. and E. Hud
son, treasurer. All of these, who were
prominent men in the community, have
passed away as well as all of the charter
members.
There were present the majority of the
members and invited guests, among them
Grand Secretary G. T. Shaw and Grand
Treasurer J. W. Harris. In the lodge room
B. B_ Jacobs delivered a short address, af
ter which he read several pages of the
minutes of the lodge of fifty years ago.
Then followed vocal solos by J. W. E.
Allen and Louis Lacaze, a cornet solo by
I. C. Coggin and prestidigitation by F. W.
Warren and S. R. Jacobs.
After the business in the lodge room
there was an adjournment to the banquet
hall, where an excellent supper was served
under the supervision of the committee of
arrangements, composed of S. R. Jacobs,
P. D. D. G. M.; F. A. Jennings, F. W.

and L. E. Phillips. A. P. Black was toast

KICKED BY A HORSE.â Cornelius Collins
a teamster working for the City Improvement
Company at Hunter's dry dock, while harness

the head by one of the horses. He was taken
to the City and County Hospital, where Dr
Toner found that he had sustained a fracture
of the skull.
Though Judge Troutt denied Mrs. Crav
en's petition for a transfer of the petition
of Theresa A. Oelrlchs, Virginia Vander
bilt and Charles I* Fair for distribution
to them of the personal property of the
estate of the late James G. Fair, another
petition for a transfer of the case under
the new code amendment was filed yes
terday by Mrs. Craven. Under the new
law it is only necessary for bias and
prejudice upon the part of the court to be
alleged In a petition for a transfer to In
sure the granting of tÂ«*e same. These al
legations Mrs. Craven makes. But as the
hearing of the petition for distribution has
already commenced before Judge Troutt
it is doubtful if Mrs. Craven's efforts
to secure a transfer under the new law
will avail her.

to-day for California. Guests will begin
to arrive in considerable numbers as early
as next Tuesday.
Preparations for the convention are be
ing pushed forward rapidly. Contracts
for the decoration of the streets and
meeting places have been let. Workmen
are busily engaged Â«in refitting Mechanics'
Pavilion. Epworth League flags to the
.number of 10,000 are made and ready for
use. Every inch of space for exhibits in
the Pavilion has been let.
FROM recent Information received
at Epworth League headquarters
it is evident that the number of
visitors who will be here at the
time of the convention will be
greater than has been previously estimat
ed. Over the Rio Grande road alone there
have been scheduled more than forty
trains, which will bring nearly 12,000 peo
ple. It Is thought that there will be twice
as many mere pass over all other roads
combined. Taken with the number of
Californlans who will come to San Fran
cisco from the interior for the occasion,
the local officials are confident that there
will be at least 60,000 strangers in the city
during the convention.
News has been received that there is
already a lack of Pullman sleepers in the
East and considerable difficulty is being
experienced in getting sleeping car ac
commodations by those who are late in
making their decisions to come West at
this time. Cornelius S. Loder of New
York has booked four excursion trains for
California for this month, and states that
he can easily arrange others if cars are
forthcoming.
Word has been received that Dr. Co
burn of Trinity Church, Denver, will not
be able to speak at the convention, as pre
viously arranged, but his place on the pro
gramme will be filled by President H. A.
Buehtel of Denver University.
A band of 300 Leaguers left Qulncy, III.,
W. de L. Klngsbury, In charge of the
finances, reports rather slow progress.
More than 510,000 is yet needed to defray
the expenses of the affair. The conven
tion is now less than two weeks distant
and some apprehension is felt lest the de
sired amount should not be forthcoming.
It is assured that the affair will bring
many hundreds of thousands of dollars
into the city, and the league officials feel
that on that account, if for no other rea
son, the public should make a generous
contribution.

was decided to establish a new Park
Emergency Hospital. The Park Commis
sioners have set apart a lot on Stanyan
street, near Waller, for this purpose, and
within a few days work will be begun un
der the supervision of Park Superintend
ent McLaren.
There was present at the meeting Park
Commissioners M. J. McDonald, John
Stanton and Reuben H. Lloyd and Dr.
Bunnell and Secretary Emery of the
Health Board. These gentlemen discussed
at length the advisability of establishing
an Emergency Hospital near the park and
all were unanimous in approving of such
a dan.
The Board of Supervisors has set aside
$9000 for such a hospital and it will be
built immediately. Efforts will be made
to make the hospital a model of its kind
and physicians and nurses will be detailed
to be constantly on duty. The many acci
dents to visitors to the park makes it ab
solutely necessary for such a hospital.

Ihe uelegtite of the Shipwrights' and
Calkers* Union reported that the execu
tive officers of the Union Iron Works had
requested a conference with the "straw
bosses " individually, but they had decided
to call on them collectively and not indi
vidually at the time suggested.
A division of sentiment regarding the
publication of the proposed weekly news
paper to be devoted to the interests of
labor -was reported by the representatives
of various unions, but the majority fa
vored the project.
The Journeymen Horseshoers* Union
has donated $2J9 for the benefit of the
striking machinists.
A communication was received from the
Etate Federation of Labor agreeing to pay
one-half of the expense of the circulation
of the petition to Congress asking the
continuance and extension to our new
possessions ot the present Chinese exclu
sion act, which expires Slav 5, 1S*J2.
International Bartenders' "League, Local
No. 41, has anilialed with the council. The

A r.rmber of organizations reported that
the- request ot the Retail Drug Clerks' As

The Upholsterers' Union has asked that
a boycott be placed upon the California

upholstering firms that have granted the
ualon demands.
The strike of the Cooks' and Waiters'
Alliance and the attitude of the wholesale
jobbing and retail butchers as to the fur
nishing of meat to restaurants displaying
the nsfon card furnished the greater por
tion of the discussion at the regular meet
ing of the San Francisco Labor Council
held last night, which met for the first
time in Pioneer Hall.
But little new developed yesterday in,
labor circles. About 500 men are now em
ployed at the lUsdon Works, some of
them beinjr the men Â¦who went out on
strike May 20-. The machinists, or the
men connected with that union, claim
they never belonged to the organization.
Many of them came from th'e Eastern
States.
"I am sure that the Union Pacific and
Southern Pacific freight and ticket offices
in this city will be consolidated within a
year," said a railroad official yesterday.
It is said that Colonel I>. W, Hitchcock
is safe in his position, as he is a great
friend of J. C. Stubbs, and although well
on in years he is still a capable railroad
man. Thomas Schumacher, the freight
agent of the Union Pacific, also enjoys an
enviable record. Should the consolidation
be made he will no doubt assist William
Snroule, who is the chief freight official
of the Southern Pacific in this city.
Sproule is at present in the East. On his
return to this city he will move into the
offices that were formerly occupied by
Stubbs.
President Hays has made no announce
ment of any changes, but they will not
come unexpected, however. Fltzliugh.
who, it is said, is selected to fill an impor
tant position with the Southern Pacific
road, is still examining the different divi
sions. He holds the proud distinction of
being the only operating official outside of
Hays who is allowed to hitch his private
car on to a "limited" train.
Now that J. C. Stubbs has- gone East as
chief traffic manager for Harriman all
sorts of rumors are afloat. A number of
prominent railroad officials claim that
Hays has lost considerable power and that
Stubbs will take precedence over him,
both in rank and salary.
"The Southern Pacific and the Union
Pacific are distinct roads," said he. "and
I am sure that there are no steps being
taken to consolidate them."
President Hays is not as ready to talk
with members of the press as he was
when he first arrived in San Francisco.
Secretary Ingram, his majordomo, now
talks for him. Secretary Ingram, on be
ing asked yesterday if there was any
truth in the rumor that the accounting
departments were to be consolidated, said
that there was absolutely nothing: in the
report.
A rumor has been going the rounds that
the accounting departments of_ the Union
and Southern Pacific roads are to be con
solidated and that headquarters Is to be
established in Omaha. The report is no
doubt due to the call East of several of
the accounting department officials, in
cluding C. J. "Wilder and E. E. Hoiton.
who went to Omaha to confer with E.
Rastus Young, chief accountant of the
Union Pacific. Those who are in a posi
tion to know say that the conference was
simply called for the Harrtman roads to
agree upon and adopt a uniform system
of keeping books and making out reports.

date Southern and Union

That portion of the Master's report find
in? that Charles H. Smith Is not entitled
to intervene and dismissing Smith's
amended bill is held in reserve by Judge
Morrow, who has already held in another
cast that Smith is the owner of the bonds.
The action was brought June 17, 1SS6, to
foreclose a mortgage executed by the Cal
ifornia and Nevada Railroad Company,
April 10, 1884, to secure to the complainant
the payment of certain first-mortgage
bonds of the defendant company to the ex
tent of $5,000,000, of which 545 bonds were
Issued of the face value of $1000 each. The
Oefvndant railroad company filed no an
swer to the suit. On December 26, 1896.
Charles H. Smith filed a bill of interven
tion, alleging that he was the owner of
304 of the bonds issued and that 200 of the
remaining bonds issued were illegal and
invalid, and not being a legal obligation of
the defendant company, could not be en
forced as against its property.
The Master-in-Chancery found that 343
of the bonds, including those claimed by
Smith, were legally issued and are legal
and valid obligations of the defendant
railroad company, but that none of the re
maining 200 of said bonds were legally is
suf.ti. and should be surrendered. and can
celed; that the Oakland and San Fran
cisco Terminal Company Is not in the po
sition of a holder for value without notice,
and the bonds voted and delivered to it
by jhe defendant railroad company were
illegally issued- and not valid obligations
except in the hands of a bona-fide pur
chaser, and that eleven of the 200 bonds
held by. J. H. T. Watkinson are legal. The
prayer of Mary E. Roberts for priority
over the bondholders is denied.
Proceedings- to foreclose the mortgage
on the California and Nevada Railroad
Company were brought to a conclusion
yesterday by a decree, issued by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow, who ap
proved of all but one of the findings of
United States Master-in-Chancery llea
cock in the case of the Central Trust Com
pany of New York vs. California and Ne

CASE DECISION
HAIRDRESSIXG COLLEGES.
Short Cut to Barbsring.
A prospective "tonsorial artist" dropped
in during the afternoon and deposited
with Manager Van Orden $60 to insure his
course of tuition and an outfit, and signed
the following agreement:
THE MOLER SYSTEM OF BARBER AXD
Moler's "College" .is one of a series of
"colleges" located throughout the coun
tr>% In one corner in a pen constructed
of wire netting, resembling a police court
dock, a lot of "subjects" were gathered.
About a dozen embryo barbers stood at
chairs placed before a cheaply construct
ed redwood counter, who lathered and
scraped or cut the hair of the applicant as
he wished. The patrons were charity sub
jects drawn in by the ticket entitling 1
them to a free shave.
He did not wear his official badge, but he
learned more of the method of turning out
barbers at short notice than he ever an
ticipated. He saw the conditions of the
places, observed the work, and made
notes that will probably cause the man
agers of the two establishments to wish
they had not gone into the business..
President Calish visited the "Moler Col
lege" on Clay street and the "San Fran
cisco Barber College" on Howard street
yesterday.
"Barber Colleges" are shortly to be
eliminated from the list of institutions of
learning in San Francisco. Just who will
take the initiative in the movement will
be decided upon as soon as the president
of the State Board of Barber Examiners
and the president of the local Board of
Health can get together and determine
upon the best means to be used.

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Manufacturing: has been Interrupted by the
labor agitations. Numerous prostrations - from
heat caused humane employers to close mills
during the most. distressing hours, while tha
sheet and hoop Workers were ordered to stop
work until certain disputed points were set
tled. No Immediate settlement is anticipated
Dex'elopraents of fresh i labor troubles is a
feature of a week that has made for con
servatism In many directions, but' through
out the country jobbing and retail lines are
busy and are handling goods at prices which
yield fair profits. There is a reflection of
this activity In the continued Improvement In
the textile markets in the East and the un
easiness over the money market does . not ex
tend beyond the ranks of - speculators Jn
stocks. Crop reports continued/gratifying,
much good having been done by rains in the
Middle .West. Harvesting of winter wheat
PT ogresses f avorably. - Â¦â¢ â¢

NEW YORK, July 5.â R, G. Dun & Co.'i
Weekly Review of Itade will sayt
Dun's Review of Trade.
Only three days of this week were devoted
to business In Wall street and the market, es
pecially on Monday and Tuesday, was nar
rowed by the torrid weather and natural cur
tailment of outside interest. Transactions
were on a very small scale and this fact was
as effectual as the discomfort which the finan
cial community experienced in causing the
Vew York Stock Exchange members and
Governors to reverse a previous decision and
determine to close the board on Friday and
Saturday as for the legal holiday on Thursday.
In the street Itself the unusual step involved
was generally approved even in banking cir
cles, though It was noted Â¦ that the banks and
other lenders in view of the four days' holi
day took the precaution to call In loans ex
tensively, putting the money in some cases
out at a much higher rate and exacting
pledges, to be prepared to pay the loana on
Friday If it was deemed necessary to call
them. This process led to a decided harden
ing of call money on Wednesday, the; rate ad
vancing to 15@20 per cent, and a good part
of the loans made over the holiday were at
8@12 per cent. Prior to this the money market
seemed to be reverting back to an easier con
dition. - eÂ»>j

CHICAGO, July 5. â Weak cables and heavy
domestic receipts were the reasons for the
easier feeling in the wheat market at the open
ing. Trading, was dull and within a narrow
range and the pit was nearly deserted during
the entire day, the interest of traders centering
in the coarse grains. Toward the close the re
markable demand for corn and oats and the
material- rise in prices of both had a strength
ening effect and when added to reports of rust
in spring wheat in consequence of excessive
moisture, the situation became strong. Sep
temper opened" Vic lower at 6o%@â¬0c and the
fluctuations were within Vic rang*, the close
being at 66%@66%c.
Corn opened easier on rains in Kansas, but
the relief thus afforded the situation gave way
later in the session to bullish reports from the
country and the market strengthened. At the
low point both longs and shorts were quite ac
tive on the buying side, wnich also helped to
start the price upward. When buying orders be
gan to come in from the country there was a
wild scramble among. the shorts in an attempt
to cover. September closed y 2 c higher at 47%c.
There was a large trade in oats with the buy
ing general and of good character. Continued
dry weather and generally poor outlook for the
crop were the main bull factors. September
closed with a gain l%@l^c. at 29c.
There was better local demand for provisions,
due to some extent to the poor outlook for the
corn crop. September pork closed 2%c higher,
ribs 7&c higher and lard 12%c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
Wheat exports for the year lRiO-1901 are 217,
133,361 bushels, against 200.C79.750 bushels the
preceding season, and 227,715,464 bushels in
1898-99.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3,787.630 bushels, against 4,364,
147 bushels last week. 3.018,832 bushels in the
corresponding week of 3900, 3,758.972 bushels in
1839. and 2.728,642 bushels in 1SS8.
June failures were the smallest of any month
this year, but liabilities were swelled by a -few
heavy suspensions of banks and were the
heaviest for more than a year past. Consider
ing the increased volume of business in- the past
two years, the six months recorded is a very
favorable one, as the total number of failures
for the half year was 5463, with liabilities of
SC6.13S.362, and assets of a little less than one
half this amount.
NEW YORK, July 5.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
will 6ay: Hot weather, holidays and stock
taking, the first named particularly, have lim
ited trade in the period under review and
caused a practical suspension in industrial ac
tivity in many cities. Against this seemingly
unfavorable feature, however, is to be noted
the fact that a good business has been done in
all kinds of seasonable 'products at retail and
the check to trade at wholesale has been large
ly a postponement rather than actual elimina
tion of possible business. The crop situation
has on the whole Improved and corn and cot
tQn, the two leading crops most In question at
present, have gained some of the ground lost
early in the season by cold weather. The
wheat crop is certainly in a favorable condi
tion, because harvesting has gone forward rap
idly and prices on the whole have been quite
satisfactory.
Corn shows the heaviest advance for many
weeks, for years past, on reports of dry, hot
weather damage, aided, however, by specula
tive manipulation and a fairly good export
business. Wheat is lower on liquidation, in
duced by good crop reports, and despite con
firmation of the heavy deficit in the German
crop, the poor French crop and of the short
yield in Hungary, with doubtful prospects in
oiher countries of Europe. Oats are higher,
owing to the reports for domestic crop pros
pects. Hog products were strong earlier, but
broke and finished lower on the week on liqui
dation, caused by bear raids.
The feature in retail trade this week has
been the very large distribution of all classes
of summer goods, Induced by the hot spell.
Wholesale distribution has been comparatively
limited, but it is to be noted that Western Job
bers have experienced a good reasserting de
mand, based on hot weather conditions. The
textile situation is fully as favorable as a week
ago.
Common goods production has felt the influ
ence of regularly planned curtailment and In
addition has been affected by shut downs, due
to the heat. The tone of values is firmer, and
the outlook is regarded as encouraging.
The boot and shoe trade is in good shape.
Manufacturers are making good sales and get
the prices they demand and would be freer
buyers of leather were it not that dealers are
slow to permit this in view of the firmer tone
of hides and the feeling that an upward ten
dency in the finished product may shortly en
sue.
In the iron and steel trades stocks ' and
weather have been features,, leading to unset
tlement. but Just how much ldlenes Is due to
the demands of labor organizations It is hard
to measure, because of shut downs of iron and
steel mills for repairs, or because of the hot
conditions.- The fact is that none of the union
mills ordered struck by the Amalgamated As
sociation are now running at full capacity, and
the employers claim that they welcome the shut
down of the union mills teo as to allow of need
ed repairs.
Dullness due to exceptional weather condi
tions and to the closing of the Stock Exchange
from Wednesday till next Monday deprived
New York stock market transactions of im
portance. The effect of unfavorable crop ad
vices on the granger and Pacific railway
stocks was modified by subsequent reassuring
news. The only feature of the market was the
United States Steel market, which, after the
declaration of 1% per cent on the preferred and
1 per cent on Ihe common stock, broke moder
ately, partly on realizing and partly on fears
of an extension of the labor trouble at the
American Sheet Steel mills to constituent con
rprns

Commercial failures during the first half of
1901 numbered 5759, with liabilities of $35,804 -
690, ajrainst 5332 last year for $74,747,452. In
manufacturing lines there were 1625 defaults
with $21,691,048 liabilities, while 4J90 traders
failed for $24,864,207. The improvement over
the preceding year was most striking â¢ In
brokerage and banking insolvencies, which
were $9,200,435 and $15,839,554 respectively,
against $22,124,340 and $25,822,682 last year.
This is the more noteworthy, because the vio
lent agitation In Wall street during May was
calculated to cause serious disturbances and
the 'last week of June brought other failures
through injudicious speculation and poor bank
ing methods. While the half year's state
ment is gratifying, the second quarter makes
a- much better showing, liabilities declining
$7,202,282, compared with the first quarter, and
$17,623,675, in comparison with the second quar
ter of 1900. The average liability per failure
was smaller than in the corresponding three
months . of any year since the records were
first compiled. The proportion of bad debts to
solvent payments through clearing houses was
but 69c to each $1000 and only one out of the
preceding 105 . quarters recorded a lower ratio,
while the average amount of defaults to each
firm in business was but $20.33, only seven
other quarterly periods making smaller re
turns.

News from the West was full of promise as
to the growing wheat yield, causing a further
decline in prices, although foreign needs are
eald to bo heavy. Corn steadied somewhat
because of the reported injury from heat
and drought. Receipts continue light in com
parison with last year's, but exports are
equally unsatisfactory. Cotton holds firmly
at a point a little below 9c, the free move
ment despite old stock being disregarded.
Etrengtn Is found in the greater activity in
the goods market, together with rumors of
rain In Texas and a fewoher States where
moisture Is deficient. Sales of No. 7 Rio
coffee have been made below 6e, which Is not
surprising since receipts at Rio and Santos
ports for the crop year Just ended were little ;
short of eleven million bags. Even this rec
ord-breaking crop will be . surpassed if the
current yield is equal to expectations. Com
pared with the 'prices of a year, ago wheat
shows a decline of lie a bushel, cotton $6 25 a
bale and coffee 3%c a pound, while corn is
not higher than last- year's price and pork
products alone of these commodities show any
advance. â¢Â¦ - .

A Honduras correspondent writes:
"Having - occasion to use some money in
the interior, I went to the local banker,
and, taking a single United States bill
from my vest pocket to purchase the
same, was asked: 'Is your mule at the
door?' My reply was, 'He Is ready.' And
for the single bill, weighing less than one
quarter of an ounce,, I was obliged to load
the mule with 150 pounds of silver money
and transport it some ninety miles into
the Interior. Surely, the 16 to 1 doctrine Is
soon knocked out of even the most rabid
man after a short experience in this coun
try, and you can't get rid of the burden,
as the entire business is" carried, on with
this silver currency."â Boston Herald.
On receiving the letter the fortunate
ycung man resorts to the old-time expe
dient of holding it near the fire, and im
mediately the writing becomes visible,
traced delicately in lines of blue. Where
this new invention claims superiority to
anything of the kind hitherto offered is
In its extreme simplicity. Also, the pa
per is in convenient commercial shape
ana.Triot least important, the writing does
not fade or deteriorateâ a common diffi
culty with most "sympathetic" manu
script.
The paper is prepared by soaking it in
soluble salts of cobalt, after which the
cobalt is rendered insoluble by dipping the
paper into sodium carbonate.
Now an Inventor proposes to make
things agreeable for lovers by putting on
the market a superior kind of "paper for
secret writing," as he calls it, which will
be made of note size and packed in neat
boxes, accompanied by the requisite en
velopes. When a young lady wishes to
write to her heart's adored, and is anx
ious that outsiders shall not by any
chance become acquainted with the con
tents of her missive, sue simply dips her
pen in a. solution of salt and water, with
a little vinegar added, and in that harm
less and invisible medium indites her epis
tle.

Glen Preston was beloved by his teach
ers and fellow-students at the Mount
Tamalpais Academy for his many ad
mirable attributes. He had just finished
his first year there and had three yeare
more to go before his graduation. His
former home was In "Waitsburg, "Wash.,
where he was born. His only relatives
are a brother and two sisters, his parents
being dead. The body will be taken to
Waitsburg for burial.
Drs. A. A. Stafford and H. G. Thomas
were given charge of the case and In the
interests of medical science they made a
careful study of its various * symptoms,
which they considered remarkable in
many respects. In spite of the physicians'
skill, however, the paralysis increased un
til the whole of the" brain was affected by
the disease. Then death ensued.
"It is one of the most unusual cases that
I have had to do with," said Dr. Stafford
this afternoon. "It was a cerebral dis
order that was undoubtedly caused by
over-study. The boy, who was not very
strong, overtaxed his strength by his
study until his brain became diseased
This Is the inevitable result of over
study." . ,
A little. more than a month ago young
Preston â¢ succumbed to the over-exertion
of his .i#nd and body. He began to fail
rapidly/ The physicians at San Rafael
diagnosed his ailment and discovered that
he was the victim of an attack of pro
gressive brain paralysis. They advised
that he be brought to Alameda, where he
could receive skilled treatment at the
Alameda Sanatorium and be near his rela
tives.
at San Rafael, which he had been attend
ing for about a year. ;
From the time he entered the academy
young Preston was a zealous and am-\
bitious student. His natural bent was to
crowd as much into a day as possible, and
he gave up many hours to close applica
tion, which he might hare given to recre
ation. He pursued his studies with such
ardor that the attention of his teachers
was directed to his neglect of himself by
hi3 . failing health and they â¢warned him
that he must give at least a portion of his
time to recreation. He persisted, fhow
ever, in applying himself to his books,
deeming himself physically strong enough
to withstand the strain until the term
closed , and the vacation months came.

Colonel Lovell H. Jerome, who has
broad shoulders and a deep chest and who
stands six feet flat In his stocking feet,
was riding up town in a Fifth avenue
stage last evening with a party of
friends. They got Into the stage at
Tenth street, and it was some time before
anymore passengers got aboard. Then a
young woman took a seat and soon after
several other passengers clambered in.
Amang them was a man dressed In the
latest fashion. He sat down next to the
young woman and put his arm on the
back of the seat, so that It rested on her
shoulders. Then he moved along so that

The fire at which the rescue occurred
was In the Hlnken residence, at Nine
teenth avenue and East Fourteenth street.
It was discovered at 2 o'clock this morn-
Ing by H. Morgan, ! a neighbor, who
aroused the sleeping family within and
then turned in an alarm to the fire de
partment. Going back to the house Mor
gan found It a mass of flames. The neigh
bors, who were drawn to the scene by the
alarm, were congratulating the members
of the Hinken family on their escape,
when It was suddenly discovered that no
one had brought the youngest child, a
baby but a few months old, from, the up
per room, where it slept. The- mother,
screaming in frenzy, rushed toward the
front entrance, where the flames .were
blazing fiercely, but was restrained by
pitying hands. Morgan instantly volun
teered to make the attempt to reach the
infant's cradle, and W. King, another
neighbor, accompanied him. The two dis
appeared in the furnace-like Interior,
while the crowd waited .for the result.
After a few minutes they could be seen
groping their way down the tottering
stairway, bearing a dark bundle. It was
the baby, wrapped in one of tbÂ«- men's
coats. J The child was uninjured, but both
its rescuers were badly scorched and half
overcome by the smoke and heat. While
they were being revived the floor of the
second story fell with a crash.
The fire department Was unable to do
more than prevent the flames from
spreading to adjoining structures.
The loss on the Hinken house is $2000,
partially insured. The fire is supposed to
have been due to carelessly handled fire
works.

from the attack of appendicitis which has
for the past five days demanded constant

one of the physicians summoned to wait

but^ that he Is so weak from the violent
attack. that a long period of absolute
rest and quiet Is imperatively needed to
restore him to health.
"Judge Ogden is still a very sick man,
but the Indications are that the crisis is
passed," said Dr. Chalmers. "Such an
attack as his is a serious thing for any
system to bear, and his was all run down
when he was seized." . .

PETTY QUARREL
ENDS SERIOUSLY
BERKELEY, July 5.â Mismated horses,
frightened and unmanageable, backed a
wagon full of campers over a thirty-foot
cliff last evening and nearly killed two
women and children. They were pinned
underneath the overturned vehicle.
The accident took place on the Briones
Valley road near Bear Valley In Contra
Costa County. The party consisted of
James Hamilton, who was driving; Mrs.
Hamilton and her three children of Dela
ware street, near Shattuck avenue; Miss
Annie Monroe and Otto Brodt of West
Berkeley. That any of them escaped with
their lives is remarkaBle. As it is, every
one in the party received injuries; some
of a serious nature.
The 'bus was owned by V. Sherman of
Dwight way and was drawn by a team
of two horses. One of the horses was
loaned by Philip Monroe, whose daughter
was one of the unfortunate campers. The
animal was not used to being driven
double, and on coming to a narrow place
in the road, started to back over the bank.
Hamilton was unable to check the horses
before the wagon was beyond control.
Had it not been for the bushes, which
broke the fall, fatal results would have
followed the tumble. With the assistance
of passing teamsters the wagon was lifted
to the road and the horses hitched again.
The bruised party were able to resume
their journey to their friends, where they
received treatment for their injuries.

OVER A CLIFF
OAKLAND, JulyS.â "Sixteen months
ago my wife made a vow she would
not leave our home again, volun-"
tartly, and from that day to this
she has kept to her strange deter
mination."
Such was the complaint whlc^ aged Pat
rick Smith lodged against his spouse to
day when he applied to Justice of the
Peace James G. Quinn ror a warrant for
Mrs. Smith's arrest as insane. The pe
culiarity of the husband's story 1/sd the
authorities to make investigation and the
warrant will not be issued pending further
inquiry into the case.
Out on Hollis, near B street is the mod
est dwelling where Smith, his erratic wife
and their 14-year-old son reside. He is a
pioneer of the locality, and, by years of
frugality and â¢ hard work, accumulated
enough to acquire the home in which Mrs.
Smith has for more than a year been a
voluntary prisoner. There is no complaint
on the husband's part that their life to
gether has not been of the happiest. They
are a humble, quiet couple, so all of thÂ©
"But it seems to me she has become pos
sessed of a fear that if she leaves the
place for a minute I will try to dispose
of It. Only to-day a visitor at the house
aroused her suspicions and she accused
me of Intending to part with our place."
The husband admitted willingly that his
wife had not displayed violent tendencies
and that he had no fear she would do any
dangerous act. He asserted he would give
much to know what had possessed her of
the desire to remain a prisoner in her own
home. Mrs. Smith refused to offer any
explanation upon the subject.
"She is unwilling to meet strangers,"
explained her husband.
"Neither to myself nor to others who
might happen to come here will my wife
utter one word that will solve the mys
tery of her vow," continued Smith. "It
is still more peculiar that she displays all
of the affection natural to a mother to
ward our son, and I could not find a cause
for complaint if I tried to. All I want Is
to have the doctors pass officially on her
mental condition, because I cannot believe
a sane woman would do what she has been
worrying me about all these months."

and I must confess that physicians have
told me that she is not insane.

IN OAKLAND SOCIETY.
In a signed statement issued by Brandes
to-day, with poetical accompaniment, the
writer, in the same opening paragraph,
hints and suggests that his wife or Har
vey,was responsible for the girl's death.
Yet he declares that the death was
suicide, hence out of the pale of the
criminal law. ,
The statementMs maudlin in sentiment
and inconsistent in argument, bo far as
the evidence is concerned. Brandes has
openly offered to sell for publication any
statement that might be desired of him
concerning the case.
"I need work, exercise, : fresh air and
sunlight," explained the prisoner to-day.
"That is why I will go to the" penitentiary
to serve my sentence. Or course, I shall
never be without hope that the Supreme
Court will give me another chance."
" Then he rambled off into an argument
in favor of the theory that ; his daughter
committed suicide, despite the theory of
his defense that the girl was murdered,
but not by him.
Hardly satisfied with that evident con
tradiction, Brandes sets out to cast sus
picion upon Watchman Harvey, now
dead, who was, at the first trial; an im
portant witness for the prosecution. *Mrs.
Brandes has. also been held up as a pos
sible murderess, and the entire line of the
defense was an effort to insinuate the
poison of suspicion into the minds of the
extraordinary twelve men that composed
the jury. Judge Ogden, in his final re
view of the case, said the evidence was
cold and clear that Brandes killed Lillian.
After nearly three years of confinement
in the county jail Brandes thinks he can
do no better than to change his quarters.
He says there will be an appeal from
Judge Ogden's order denying him a new
trial. But pending the decision of the
higher court, Brandes proposes to lose no
more time and to commence on his sen
tence.
Â¦William A. Brandes has decided, to-ac
cept the judgment of the court in im
posing the law's limit of ten years' im
prisonment upon his conviction for man
slaughter for the killing or his 13-year-old
daughter, Lillian. Brandes says he is
ready to don the convict stripes at Fol
som penitentiary, although in making up
his mind to begin to serve his term the
child-slayer does not give up all hope of a
chance of another trial. -.'.."..

SIGN LICENSE
Mayor Barstow Puts
Into Force a New
Fee Measure.
Ordinance Imposes an An
nual Tax on Street
Advertising.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July E.
The first Important step by the present
City Council to provide increased revenue
for the- city outside of thÂ© tax levy was
consummated to-day when Mayor Anson
Barstow signed an ordinance which Im
poses an annual license tax of $3 upon all
businesses, commercial, professional or
otherwise, which are conducted by the use
of a sign.
The enactment is known as the eign or
dinance. It makes no distinction as to
lines of business, the purpose of the
Council being to establish a licen se fee
which shall be exacted from all classes of
business. The framers of the ordinance
primarily had in view a move by jrhich
the city's treasury might be benefited
without singling out merely the traders
Jn merchandise as a special class that
ehould bear the burden of the tax.
In order to overcome that objection the
ordinance has been prepared to cover all
classes. Every firm, corporation or person
who uses a display sign of any descrip
tion in connection with its business will
pay the fee under the ordinance. It is
intended to compel a contribution from
real estate, insurance and all manners of
agents, doctorsr lawyers, dentists and the
like, besides the ordinary shopkeepers.
The measure also restricts the use of
pipiis and, it is expected, will have the
effect of clearing the business thorough
ir.res at many large and cumbersome dis
play signs and stands which are seen
every few feet in the heart of the city. '
The' Merchants' Exchange has not yet
decided what course to take with relation
io the new ordinance, and until the next
meeting of the board of directors no move
will be made, as they have been waiting
for the Mayor to act. There have been
unofficial objection to the ordinance
laised by the merchants.

Railroad Strike. in Australia.
PERTH, Western Australia, July 6.â A'
general railroad strike Â¦ for increased
wages Â¦ has commenced here and the con
sequent tie-up of the roads is complete
throughout , Western Australia.
Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦JO OiRE THREAT
President Shaffer Denies
' Story of General
-I- Strike.
Trouble Among Freight Hand
lers in St. Louis x
- Continues. : .
PITTSBURG, Jruly 5.â There, seems* to
bo little or no change in the steel strike
situation. President Shaffer of the Amal
gamated Association denied the rumor
that he was gling to New York for- a
conference with the officials of the United
States Steel Corporation, but said he
might go to Milwaukee to assist in the
settlement j of several special scales for
the Federal Steel Company. He said
there was nothing new in the . situation.
Asked whether he had made the state
ment attributed to him. that if, at the
expiration of a certain period no agree
ment had* been reached, he would order
out all the Amalgamated men employed
in mills controlled by the United States
Steel Corporation, President Shaffer re
plied that he had never given anybody
occasion to say anything of the kind. Â¦
A. reorganization of the executive per
sonnel of the National Steel Company and
the American Steel Hoop Company wa3
effected at meetings of the. boards of di
rectors in New York Wednesday, July 3,
by the election and appointment of the
following officers for both companies: W.
E." Correy, president;- H. P. Bope, first
vice president; W. W. Blackburn, second
vice president and secretary; W. Caus
land, treasurer; Henry P. Bope, general
manager of sales; J. P. -Kessler Jr., gen
eral agent;- D. G. Kerr, ore supply agent.
The result of the reorganization is that
all of the new officers are officials also of
the Carnegie Company. The general of
fices of both companies have been trans
ferred from New York to Pittsburg.
ST. LOUIS, July 5.â An effort made by
the striking freight handlers of East St.
Louis to call out the men in the freight
houses on this side 'of the river to-day
was only partially successful. Less than
a hundred went out, it Is stated. A crowd
of 200 strikers and sympathizers from, the
east side, who crossed the river, were dis
persed by the police. Theattetapt to ex
tend the strike to the Missouri side^was
made, it is said.in retaliation for the pol
icy the railroads adopted of billing -freight
through to St. Louis in order to avoid the
congested warehouses on the east side.
In East St. Louis the congestion of
traffic continues, only a small quantity
of freight being moyed. The Illinois Cen
tral Railroad â¢ has imported 120 negroes,
who were put to Â¦work injthe places, of the
striking truckers and sorters. The strik
ing freight handlers are still confident of
winning through the co-operation of other
railroad men. , .
NEW YORK, July 5.â The following of
ficial statement was given out this even
ing by the United States Steel Corpora
tion:
"Apparently some misunderstanding has
arisen in the minds of the holders of
shares of stock of the United States Steel
Corporatkin. concerning the terms intend
ed to be covered by the dividends declared,
at the last meeting of the board of direc
tors. The dividends were intended to be
quarterly dividends covering the quarter
ending June 30, 1901. The reported earn
ings of subsidiary companies for this
quarter of course are in excess of the
amount of these dividends." . ';.

MAGNATES IN CONFERENCE.
Reports Tliat th.e Corporation Leaders
Are Talking of Peace.
PITTSBURG, July 5.â There is' reason
to believe that- something: of importance
touching the interests of the sheet steel
and hoop steel mills will develop here to
tnorrotf." It 1s known that a meeting of
the Amalgamated advisory board will be
held, and It was broadly hinted from a
semi-official source late to-day that a
peace conference had been held secretly
in New Tork between J. P. Morgan, C. M.
Schwab and others high in the United
States Steel Corporation with Persifer F.
Smith and John Jarrett of Pittsburgh
"It is more than likely that a reply to
the ultimatum of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation will- be in the h%nds of officials
to-morrow in time to be discussed by the
advisory board. It is suspected that local
labor leaders were to-day in telephone
conference with the New York people.
COWBOYS RIDE
ifiisiii
Montana Tram Robbejrs
Now in the Little
Rockies.
Tho Detectives Believe They
Know Men Who Com- \
. mitted the Crime.
ST. PAUL., July 5.â Cteneral Auditor JX
I. Elliott of the. Great- Northern Express
Company said to-day that the exact
amount of the loss by, the hold-up iit
"Wagner, Mont., on Monday last, was
$41,500. All but $300. 3ras currency sent
from Washington to the Montana Nation
al Bank of Helena, the rest being Great
Northern money in the through safe.
The consignment to the* Montana Bank:
consisted of bank, notes printed in sheets
of $10 and $20 bills.' Only nine were signed
by the president and, cashier of the bank,
but all could be readily passed without
their signatures.
- Elliott received information late to
day that the identity of the men who
robbed the express safe has been estab
lished by Pinkerton men sent from/ St.
Paul. He did not care to give out their
names until satisfied, that the detectives,
had made no mistake. "If the Pinker
tons are right," said he, "the men are ex
perienced hands and have held up trains,
on other roads." 'Â¦ >
Â¦ The report that the robbers had been
surrounded, Elliott said, was not verifleot
by information received by Great North
ern officials. Their horses were chased by
a posse about fifty miles south of 'Malta,
Mont. Officials of the express company
believe that the men had fresh mounts
and suppose they eluded their pursuers
and are now in the Little, Rockies, a wild
country well supplied with hiding places.
The district will be guarded by a picked
posse and the authorities hope to capture
the men when they try to get out.
A party of cowboys has started north
from Lewiston in the Judith Basin,, to
intercept the robbers should they continue
southward from the Little Rocky Moun
tains. . . Â¦

CITY OF MEXICO, July 5.â A number
of prominent Catholics have sent a mes

scandals which have recome public here
and attacking priests who have been pu Â£>-

Pope will send a personal representative
to make an investigation of the state of

There is much, excitement over the oon
tlnued charges made by the press, espe
cially the liberal papers. One at leas.t of
the. clerical scandals is to be venti?.atett
in the criminal court immediately and
public attention is now centered on it.
There will be. a strictly impartial b'at un

REDWOOD CITY. July 5.â A n amber of
fixes were started yesterday Along the
railroad track 'between here arid San Ma

Belmont and worked up toward. the foot
hills, a distance of five or six blocks, to
the old Jnnke picnic rrounds, where it
communicated to the dwelling recently

Captain Seymour to get Detective McMa

captain refused and said it was "up to
Bier," who had sworn to the original
complaint The captain, however. In
structed McMahon to bring Collins In and
let the court deal with him. - Â¦:> :

near about nine months after be resigned
his Federal place before Brownfe was com
missioned as afmotary public. The pres
sure of the men behind Browne proved
too strong for the Governor at last, and
the appointment was made. In the mean
time Browne, lelying upon the promise
that had been made to him. it is said,
stepped out of ihe Federal service to take
a more lucrative position with the real es
tate firm of G. H. Umbsen & Co.. on
Montgomery street. His place in the se
cret service is now filled by Harry Moffltt.
a brother of Hon. Frank J. Moffltt of
Oakland. Browne was commissioned as
a notary only about one month ago, and
he has been in the employ of Umbsen &
Co. about ten months.* Moreover,- he' has
given perfect satisfaction in that employ
ment. .
Has Confidence in Browne.
"Mr. Browne is in charge of our out-of
town.business," said G. H. Umbsen. "He
has given complete and entire satisfaction
in that position. Furthermore, he can hold
it until he sees fit to leave us to better
himself.. He can -hold it as long as he
wants to, or as long as he will favor us
by doing so. I say this in the full knowl
edge of every transaction in Mr. Browne's
past life. I know all about the Moscow
Bank matter, and I know that Mr. Browne
was. In no degree culpable in that affair.
I know . also that Mr. Browne resigned
from the Federal service, and was not
forced out, as Mr. Tarpey has charged.
Mr. Browne came to me months before he
resigned and wanted to engage himself as
my -business associate. He was a man
who could, make more money than he was
getting from the Government. I did re
ceive a letter from Mr. Tarpey, but I did
not show it to Mr. Browne, and never
even told him about it. I did not want to
Insult him. The best answer I could give
to that letter was to retain him in my em
ploy. He is with me, and, as I said be
fore, will stay with me at his pleasure."
Â¦ In the meantime It Is known that the
Tarpey letter has caused the Governor a
very considerable degree of disquiet, and
while Mr. Brov/ne is undoubtedly a 1 man
who has many very warm friends, it is
probable that the end of the story is not
yet written.

would not be given to him for the reason
that they were contained in the personal
correspondence of the Governor.,
Of course, the Governor has a right to
the privacy of his personal correspond
ence. Perhaps the. names of â all of
Browne's indorsers are not so essential to
the development of the story now as they
were a few days ago. Perhaps there are
reasons why they should not be essential.
For It Is Intimated that there were more
purposes than the good of the State In
view when this particular appointment
was made. At all events, two of Browne's
most active advocates have been revealed
by. the Governor, and these two were will
ing to talk when seen. "I don't think I
signed Mr. Browne's petition for appoint
ment." said United States Marshal Shine.
"I am not sure on that. But I wrote a
personal letter to the Governor in his be
half. He wanted to go into the real estate
business when he resigned from the secret
service, and the appointment was to help
In that. "Yes, I heard that Tarpey -wrote a
letter about him, but I have no doubt that
Browne can explain that matter to your
satisfaction. You see him. His record In
office here was perfectly straightforward
and honest. I never heard the slightest
breath of wrongdoing hinted at. f>
Hon. W. E. Dargie of Oakland, who was
also said by Governor Gage to have been
particularly .active in the. matter of secur
ing the appointment, was likewise willing,
to talk. "I am primarily responsible for
the appointment of Browne;'.', said Mr.
Dargle. "I went and .saw the Governor
about it myself. It. was nothing- to me
especially, but. I. did It. for a. friend of mine.
I stand by my friends. 'Subsequently to
the appointment- the Tarpey 1 letter came
up, and the Moscow Bank matter has been
explained to me.I believethat Browne is
all right." " â¢ . .; . , . , !
More Behind Appointment.
But it seems that there was more behind
this appointment of Browne than â¢ either,
of the lndorsers of his candidacy who are
accessible is willing to '-tell, and the ap
pointment may eventuate in the develop
ment of several good-sized scandals. To
begin with, it was known in certain quar
ters that Browne was going to leave the
secret service a long time before he really
did leave it. " It" became known, among
other people, to Guy Barham and the co
terie of Southern California p politicians
who are popularly supposed to be close
to the Governor,, and. In" some way. these
politicians likewise learned that Browne's
resignation of Â¦ his place was contingent
upon his receiving an. appointment as.no
tary public. Browne's place In* the secret
service was a" good job for a" hungry man,
and the Barham crowd ; determined < to
have It for one of their, men who was
hungry. Who this man was is not stated,

The awful murder of little "Robbie"
Hlslop la. no longer a mystery. After
weeks of hard work the police have finally
succeeded m locating the fiend who killed
the unfortunate boy. He la now under
constant surveillance and will be arrested
Just as soon as the chain of evidence
against him Is completed.
Since the commission of the frightful
crime Captain Seymour has had several
of his men working diligently to -find the
murderer. The only tangible clew to the
perpetrator was the ax which was used
by the murderer and which was found In
a vacant lot several hours after the crime
was discovered. After having a house to
house canvass made for an owner for the
Instrument of death, but without success,
the police were about to give up In de
spair, when they ran across a young man
who saw the murderer leaving the house.
The Murderer Eecognizsd.
' ' The detectives who are working on the
case refuse to say who the witness Is, but
they admit that he recognized the mur
derer as he started up the street. He
called after him, but the fellow did not
stop and was soon lost in the darkness."
Notwithstanding the reticence of the
police, it Is known that the man who Is
now under surveillance is a hardened
criminal, who has been arrested repeat
edly for various offenses. The motive
which prompted him to commit the brutal
murder was burglary. He saw Mrs. His
lop leave the house to Join her husband,
who conducts a store only a few blocks
from the scene of the crime, and conclud
ing that the residence was temporarily
deserted he determined to enter it in the
hope of securing rich booty.
After unlocking the door with a skele
ton key. he v/ent upstairs and started to
ransack the house. Failing to find any
thing of value in several of the rooms, he
entered the one occupied by young Hlslop,
when suddenly the boy awoke and pre
sumably recognized him. Fearing expo
sure and a consequent term In State's
prison, he used the ax with deadly effect
on the helpless boy.
As far as the Hlslops know, the desper
ate fellow secured only a gold pin, which
he found in a bureau drawer.
Searching for Evidence.
Every effort Is being made by the police
to find the pin. The various pawn shops
and second-hand . stores have ' been
searched for it, but without success. Un
til he becomes thoroughly satisfied that
the pin is hopelessly lost Captain Sey
mour intends to continue the search for it.
Who the man is they have under sur
veillance the police refuse to say. \ They,
however, admit that they '. are satisfied
that he is the right man, but for the pres
ent time, presumably on account of ,Â¦ wait
ing to get additional evidence against him,
they have decided not to immediately
throw him In Jail. Detective Tom Gibson,
who has charge of the case, thinks that
he will have enough evidence against the
fellow to warrant him in .placing him un
der arrest the early part of next week.

After a Disastrous .Road
Venture.
He Suddenly Leaves-the Oity
Oeor^e Hemple, a theatrical man*sÂ«ri
who for a brief period directed the for
tunes of Bobert Downing, the distin
guished tragedian, is missing, Hemple
left the city very unexpectedly a. few days
efto, and there are numerous persons who
have reason to deplore his sudden de
parture.
Hemple erriYed la this city la February
In thÂ« capacity of manager for Robert
Downla.fr. He is a German of excellent
family, about 40 years of age. well edu
cated and a gUb conversationist. He
advertised the fact that he was a capable
theatrical maain every quarter where that
declaration might prove of value. He
claimed to have been the discoverer of the
queer circumstance that Anna Held dally
bathed in milk, and that he wa6 the first
to give publicity to that remarkable ad
vance agent's yarn. He also alleged,
â¢without fear of contradiction, that he was
the manager In his time of more theat
rical notables *Jian any other man on this
or the other side of the Atlantic
Hemple's connection in a managerial ca
pacity with Mr. Downing was the open
sesame to the hearts and reepect of nu
merous local theatrical foils, who now
have reason to mourn the confidence they
reposed in him. Although invariably out
of funds, he wasted the resources that
came his way with princely prodigality.
He lived at the St. Nicholas, where he
maintained an elegant suite, but when he
grew tired of the fare dispensed at this
hostelry he did not disdain to entertain
his friends at a fashionable downtown
French restaurant If the money neces
sary to liquidate the bills was not always
forthcoming, his assertion that he wae
the manager of Robert Downing was of
fered Instead, with flattering success.
Thus it was that Hemple soon became a
much sought for individual by collectors
for proprietors of this and sundry other
resorts.
Hemple Signs a Star.
All this might have been lived down had
not Hemple met his fate in the person of
& handsome, dark-eyed woman with the
atrical aspirations, known in certain
quarters as Mamie Ferguson. This was
a.bout two months ago, when Hemple was
considering tha project of sending a com
pany to tour the interior towns. Miss
Ferguson's charms of person and manner,
her soulful eyes, her chic, her talent and
her evident desire to shine as - a star in
the theatrical firmament completely cap
tured the susceptible heart of Hemple,
who immediately signed her for a starring
tour in an act designated as "The Flying
Angel." That 6be was in no sense an an
g-el for Hemple the sequel proved. That
she flew Into Sacramento and one or two
other interior towns with disastrous re
sults to her entranced manager the re
sults amply showed. ,
To put a company on the road required
money, but Hemple did not allow this
trifling circumstance to worry him. He
had a friend in George Davis, the popu
lar treasurer of the Central Theater, who
when he was convinced that Hemple's
theatrical scheme was plausible readily
advanced him $200 as a starter. Downing
yielded up a. trifle of $100 more, and from
other sources Hemple realized enough to
send his aggregation of vaudeville novel
ties on the road. All of those who con
tributed to this fund were sanguine of
golden returns, and all had Hemple's
warmest assurance that he would return
the loans out of the first proceeds that
came to his hands.
The Company Disbands.
It is here where the "ansel" steps con
spicuously to the front. Angels with
black eyes, who are en rapport with man
agers, often require and obtain trifles dear
to the feminine heart even though the
whole of the managerial store must be
disbursed in order to procure the needed
finery. Thus it was that Miss Ferguson's
wardrobe was enriched to the degree that
her female companions became Jealous â a
circumstance that proved a fatal
stumbling block to the company's pro
gress. A vast amount of lingerie was
purchased by Hemple uncomplainingly
with money that should have gone to his
backers, and it was this to which his
downfall is principally due.
After a precarious existence of several
â¢weeks on the road Hemple disbanded the
company to return to this city and face
his creditors. Explanations were demand
ed and his failure to make promised re
turns, he claimed, was because business
was shockingly bad. Inquiries developed
the fact that most of the financial returns
were wasted upon Miss Ferguson, for
whom Hemple confessed he entertained
the warmest attachment. He had been
given an order upon a theatrical supply
house by Davis for some $30, for goods re
quired In his venture, and when pressed
to tell what he had done with this he ad
mitted that "the angel" had appropriated
the whole of it to her own use. The storm
then broke, and in order to escape the
brunt of it Hemple left town without bid
ding his erstwhile friends good-by. He
incidentally left a board bill of $28 at the
Et. Nicholas which Downing, who In a
burst of generosity had gone his security,
has since liquidated.
The whereabouts of Hemple Is only
vaguely known. Some say he has re
turned to Chicago, which city he claims
as his home, but others assert that be is
driving a wagon for a lumber company in
Sierra County. Be that as It may. his
creditors vow they will have revenge if
they ever come across him within the con
fines . of California. It is certain that
Hemple has not written to any of them to
express â¢ sorrow or venture the assurance
that he would one day make a satisfac
tory, adjustment of accounts.
Downing''s Costly Experience.
Downing says he is willing to allow the
matter to drop. "It has been a valuable
experience to me," he said last night. "I
picked him up in Chicago on my return to
this city. He seemed to be a capable and
reliable fellow who was temporarily in
hard luck. When I opened my dramatic
school I made him my registrar. Then
came this theatrical venture, which prom
ised good results. He did well enough had
he not become attached to a certain
Â¦woman whose demands upon his purse
were jnore than his means could supply.
I found that he deceived me in business
matters, and when he was confronted
with, his shortcomings he admitted that
he had acted foolishly. He promised to
make good the loans, but that was the
Â¦last Been of him. I have not the slight
est Idea where he may now be found. My
friendship for Hemole cost me a matter
of only $300 or so, but my experience is
worth vastly more than that."
Treasurer Davis, when seen at the Cen
tral Theater, said he would like to have
the opportunity to give Temple a blow or
two in the solar plexus. He asked for
nothing more, nor did he have anything
to pay in addition. He admitted, however,
that he had given money to Hemple arid
that he had recovered a portion of it
shortly after Hemple's return to the city.
The other creditors whp were seen de
clined to diswss the matter In any wav.

Mr. Tarpey recites in his letter the fact
that he preferred charges against Browne
with Secretary of the Treasury Gage at the
time that Browne was still in the employ
of the secret service, and the further fact
that he had written to G. H. Umbsen,
whosefemploy Browne had entered upon
leaving the service of the United States,
to warn Mr. Umbsen of the character of
man the writer of the letter believed
Browne to be. : Lastly, Mr. Tarpey refers
the Governor to the history of the Mos
cow bank failure ar.d of Browne's alleged
connection therewith, published in The
Call of September 6, 7, 8 and 13, 1898.
There is no dispute about the fact that
the Moscow National Bank failed, nor
of the further fact that R. S. Browne
was the president of the bank during the
eight years preceding Its failure. Neither
Is it disputed that Clarence M. Brune.
his brother, although their names are not
the same, was the cashier of the bank at
the time of the failure. The full text of
D. P. Tarpey's letter to Hon. Lyman
Gage, Secretary of the Treasury, was
published on September 6, 1898. It em
braces sworn statements of the "re
sources" and "liabilities" of the bank, as
mada-by Browne and Brune, and the de
cisiens of the court leave no room' for
doubt that great frauds were . perpetrated
by somebody. The Call of September 13,
1S98, contained a statement that Browne's
great friend at Washington was Frank A.
Vanderllp, Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury. Still another friend at court
was John B. Wilkie, who succeeded Wil
liam P. Hasen as chief of the Secret Ser
vice Department.
Story of the Appointment
So much for the Tarpey charges, and
for the past life of Robert S. Browne so
far as those charges relate to it. The
next chapter, following the failure of the
Moscow Bank, crooked or not, finds
Browne serving In the position of secret
service officer at San Francisco, and the
last nnds him, at the present time, act
ing as a Notary Public with but one short
month of service behind him. The story
of his appointment by Governor Gage is
interesting. "I remember distinctly,"
said Governor Gage, speaking upon the
matter, "that Browne was highly in
dorsed for the position of Notary Public.
I cannot at this time recollect the names
of all those who recommended him, but
I remember that United States Marshal
Shine and W. E. Dargle were active in
petitioning for his appointment. . Special
pressure in Browne's behalf was exerted.
I cannot recall an instance where greater
effort was made to secure the appoint
ment of a Notary Public than was put
forward by the lndorsers of Mr. Browne.
I knew nothing of his career as a banker
In Idabo, and am rot familiar with the
fact that his record has been published.
I did not know him personally, but issued
the commission on the strength of his
recommendations. The first hint that I
received that he was not deserving of
trust and confidence was given in Mr.
Tarpey's letter. Should I ascertain by In
vestigation that Mr. Tarpey's statements,
are sustained by the records, I may ask
for Mr. Browne's resignation. The law
does not give me power to r amove him
from office." . . . . â¢ .
Names of Indorsers Withheld.
The Governor said, further, that when
he returned to Sacramento he would look
over the papers . in the case, but in the
meantime he. saw.no objection to giving
the public the names of the men who had
requested Browne's appointment, i There
