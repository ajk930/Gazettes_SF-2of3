FAMOUS HOPE DIAMOND
SOLD TO A NEW YORKER
Diamond Dealer Purchases It From
Lord Hope for One of the
"Four Hundred."
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â The famous
Hope blue diamond is on the way to
America, having been bought for some
woman of the "four hundred." The sale
was made in London yesterday to Simon
Frankel, a Nassau-street diamond dealer,
who paid $150,000 for the gem. The pur
chase was made direct from Lord Hope
by Frankel.
Joseph Frankel has confirmed the news
of the Kale as announced in a cable mes
sage.
"We bought the diamond direct from
Lord Hope," said Frankel.
When Lord Hope a few months ago
proposed to sell the famous diamond, as
he was badly in need of money, his
brother, the Duke of Newcastle, and
other relatives sought in the English
-.courts to prevent the sale.
A After Lord Hope separated from Lady

CITY OFFICIALS AND SORROWING
FRIENDS PAY A LAST TRIBUTE
Funeral Cortege Made Up of Militia, Members of the Police De
partment, Retired Officers and Citizens in
All the Walks of Life.
funeral of the late Chief of Po
lice William P. Sullivan Jr., which
took place yesterday, was one of
the most impressive held in this
city in years. Hundreds of sor
rowing friends crowded around the bier
and paid a last tribute to the memory of
the deceased. Tears were shed in the
church, where the requiem high mass was
held, and at the grave. The sorrow was
sincere. The friends who gathered re
membered Chief Sullivan's character as a
man. They wept when the Rev. Father
Cullen told of his kindly nature, good
deeds and upright life. They recalled
his many kind acts, and grieved that he
should be taken off *ln the prime of his
manhood.
If St. Agnes Church had been twice its
size it could not have contained the sor
rowing crowd. The requiem high mass
was of the most solemn character. In
side the humble church were men of
every creed, who prayed for the repose of
the soul of the late Chief of Police.
Floral "pieces were many. They filled
the place of sorrow, and their fragrance
hung heavy over me room. They 'were
sent from many sources, and were a re
membrance of those who held the de
ceased in high esteem.
Policemen Bow in Sorrow.

Sullivan had commanded attended the

mains, and the members stood with un
covered heads as the hearse bearing its
late Chief passed through the lines.
The streets In the vicinity of the Sulli
van residence were crowded with people
long before the hour set for the funeral.
Hundreds marched silently through the
darkened home at 209 Central avenue to
take a last look at the dead." At 10 o'clock
the remains were borne to St. Agnes
Church, within a few blocks of the house,
and the requiem mass was celebrated.
Rev. Father William Kerby was cele
brant, Rev. Father Moran deacon, Rev.
Father Comerford sub-deacon, and Rev.
Father Cullen master of ceremonies. An
augmented choir rendered hymns appro
priate to the occasion. The eulogium of
the dead was delivered by Father Cullen.
He was an intimate friend of deceased
and his address moved his auditors, 'v.
tears. It was a simple narration of
Colonel Sullivan's life in the community.
He recalled the events in his honorable
career, and set them up as examples for
the youths of the city to follow. In part
he said:
We gather this morning to pay our last re
spect to one who has rought his good flght,
who has finished his business, who has kept
his faith, and we trust in the mercy of God
he may receive the crown of Justice as his re
ward.
We come to this house of God Irrespective
of religious differences and we lay aside po
litical differences. We gather around his bier
to show by our presence the appreciation we
held for him whose life Is now spent. The
presence of the city officials must be inter
preted as a sanction and approval of work well
performed, of a duty well done. The pt-esence
of numerous friends testifies the appreciation
they held for deceased. Yet there 13 another
motive for which we gather here, and that is to
show by our presence that ye sympathize with
his widow and bereaved family. From this
sanctuary in the name of friendship and re
ligion we offer that consolation that friendship
and religion bring to the heart made sad by
the hand of death.
His Life Good and Pure.
It Is not necessary to go over the life of de
ceased. His history has t*en written In the
past. You have heard of his ups and downs
in the business world; you are all familiar
with his service in the' National Guard, in the
office of the Mayor and in command of the
Police Department. Perhaps to many of you
his greatest service will be measured by his
work as commander of the League of the Cross
Cadets. You know well what he did there:
how he fought for temperance and right liv
ing. In the young men among you there are
many who claim him as an example. They
could do no better. His life was good and
pure. At home he was kind and gentle; In
.public he served honestly and well. He left
undone nothing that seemed to him right. The
city has lost a benefactor. Let us hope and.
trust that the men who copy his life of purity,
temperance and uprightness may prove them

While the War Department has not
been advised of the reported step to se
cure the release of Aguinaldo from cap
tivity through a writ of habeas corpus,
they are prepared for a move in that < 1 1 â
rection. A few weeks ago the ftr3t appli
cation of this kind was made in the ease
of a military prisoner, and as there was
seme indication of a disposition on the
part of the Philippine Commission to up
hold the right of habeas corpus in that
case the department was obliged to cable
some instructions both to General Chaffeo
and v to the commission.
The department officials have depre
cated the making: of an issue of this im
portant point, pending the decision of tho
Supreme Court in the "Fourteen Diamond
Rings Case," involving th.- question as to
'whether the constitution follows the flag.
Up "to this time there has been no real
test of the right of appjal from the Phil p
pine courts to the Federal court 3 herÂ»,
nor of the right of habeas corpus in the?
Philippines. As far as Aguinaldo is con
cerned, it is said that his captivity is only
nominal. The only evidence of it consists
in the appearance by his side of an army
officer when he visits the town. Other
,wise he is free to go anywhere.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. âA distin
guished body representing- the commer
cial organizations of New York, Boston,
Buffalo, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Indianapo
lis and Cincinnati called upon the Presi
dent to-dry to urge the importance oi
reciprocity with Canada. The delega
tion consisted of J. R. Leeson, W. B.
Bianey and E. G. Preston, representing
the Chamber ot Commerce of Boston;
Gustavc H. Schwab, chairman, and Isi
dor Strauss and S. P. Webb of the com

and George H. Anderson of the Pitts
burg Chamber of Commerce.
Leeson of Boston acted as spokesman
for the party. He told the President that
next to ureat Britain and Germany the
trade of Canada with tne Lnitea states
represented more in money to the nmnu
lacturers and producers of the United
biates that- of any other country,
and that unless sometning was done to
further that trade in the way ot reciprocal
concessions ail of it mignt De endan
gered.
Leaves It to Congress.
The President received the delegation
cordially, He said that he did not need
to be reminded of the importance of a
question to which he had given mucn
tnought and attention. He said. However,
that he did not think it proper for him
to express a preference lor reciprocity
with one particular country; that the
whole subject Â¦was being canvassed, and
he hoped that -something could be done
at the approaching session of Congress.
He added that the organizations repre
sented could do much uy bringing influ
ence to bear upon their representatives
in Congress.
Arrangements were made at the White
House to-day for the reception next week
by the President of a representative com
mittee from the reciprocity convention
which will meet at the Haleigh".HQt._'l
Tuesday, Wednesday and Tnursday.
About. 50u delegates, representing commer
cial bodies from all parts of the country,
are expected to be present. The call for
the convention is to discuss the expedi
ency and practicability of a broader ap
plication of the ' principle of commercial
reciprocity as a means of expanding thj
foreign markets tor American products.
Porto Rican Affairs.
Dr. Jose C. Barbarossa, manager of
the executive council, and L. Sanchez.
Morales of the House of Delegates of
Porto Rico talked with the President to
day about Porto Rican affairs. They
told the President that the economic con
ditions in the island were improving but
that the most pressing problem was that '
for the protection of the coffee industry,
which had been treated fully in the me
morial sent to the President by the Cham- I
ber of Commerce of San Juan. They
complimented Governor Hunt and the
other officials on the work they wer-j
doing.
Joel M. Long and former Judge Marti i
L. Pipes of Portland, Ore., saw the Presi
dent to-day and brought to his attention
the Lewis and Clark exposition, which ii
is proposed to hold at Portland in 19J5 to
commemorate the discovery of that part
of the United States.
The team of horses purchased for Pres
idem Koosevelt in Baltimore yesterday
has arrived at the White House stables.
The President is much pleased with their
appearance. They are fine, high-stepping,
stylish-looking animals and fulfill th-3
President's idea of a carriage team. They
were tried for the first time this after
noon, when the President and his daugh
ter, Miss Alice Roosevelt, took a drive be
hind them.

MADAME SEMBRICH IN "LA TRAVIATA"
WINS GREATEST TRIUMPH IN YEARS
Since Days of Patti
No Such Singing
Listened to Here
An Enthusiastic Scene
Is Witnessed in
the Opera- House
AFTER hearing the exquisite sing
ing- of Madame Sembrich In the
Verdi creation, "La Traviata,'
last evening it is no exaggeration
to say that the artistic work of
the diva stamps her as the great
est singer in the world.
Not since the days when Adellna Patti
filled the Grand Opera-house to its capa
city has any such vocalization been
heard in San Francisco as was listened
to last night by those who attended the
third night of the Grau season.
San Francisco must indeed be behind
the timts when it rewards an artist of
Madame Sembrich's standing with , a
house little more than half filled. Ju#t
why the elite of this city should signal
out a few evenings of the season and al
low the other performances to be "off
nights" is incomprehensible. If the grand
opera performances are to be judged, en
tirely on their merits, then the vast audi
ence that gathered on the first night of
the season to hear "Lohengrin" should
have been duplicated last night.
If San Francisco really wants grand
opera as presented in the capitals of the
world, it must do better than it has done
in the past two nights in the matter of
attendance.
Many Empty Seats Seen.
"Lohengrin" on Monday night was
grand, but "La Traviata" last evening
was essentially great. Those who attend
ed the performance of '"La Traviata" did
so because they are lovers of music. They
came early and did not â¢ disturb their
neighbors by proceeding to their seats
whue the opera was in progress.
There was little of the nrst night glit
ter in the Grand Opera-house wnen
Madame Sembrich stepped on the stage
in the role of the luckless Violetta. Tnere
were many handsome gowns in the audi
ence, but the red plush of empty seats in
boxes, orchestra and dress circle must be
considered a reproach to those who
should have occupied the seats.
Even the curious of the masses who
gathered in front of the opera-house on
Monday night to watch the guests arrive
were not as numerous last night, and the
police had but little trouble in keeping
a clear passage for carriages.
1 be representatives of society who were
at the opera last night came to listen and
enjoy the performance. Not a note of
Verdi's charming creation was missed.
There was no subdued conversation dur
ing the acts, and the desire to see who
was present was reserved for the inter
missions. Madame Sembrich held her
audience as if spellbound and society
small talk was a second consideration.
Sembrich Wins a Triumph.
The scene of enthusiasm that greeted
the diva at the end of the first act was
remarkable for its intensity. Men and
women rose from their seats and shouted
applause at the smiling and bowing ging
er. Again and again was the curtain
raised, but the plaudits increased in vol
ume. The duet "Follie, sempre libera
degg-'io," had touched all hearts, and
every nerve in the audience was strained
to its limit.
For the fifth time Sembrich was called
to the stage, but the applause would not
cease. Good-naturedly, the diva broke all
traditions of grand opera and once again
the audience listened to the angelic voice
of the singer. Sembrich, who last season
was obliged to terminate her engagement
in thie city owing to illness, is not likely
to forget her reception of last night, nor
will there be any empty seats when she
sing? on Saturday afternoon in "Faust."
The balance of the cast of "Traviata"
presented no new faces last night. Sa
lignac has been heard here before with
Melba, and he is one of the dramatic ten
ors whom Grau prizes. He shared honors
with Sembrich and was accorded consid
erable applause. Campanari was in fine
voice, and the work of the chorus and or
CAUGHT ROBBING
IN POKER GAME
New York Lawyer Re
signs From Manhat
tan Club.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â Charged with
suspicious transactions at cards, a mem
ber of the Manhattan Club and promi
nent lawyer with Western railroad con
nections has been given an opportunity
to resign.
Six were in a poker game. All were
well known members of high standing in
business and social life. As the hours
dragged along luck seemed to trend too
much in one direction.
A participant in the game became con
vinced that some peculiar methods were
being pursued and he determined to take
the earliest opportunity of exposing the
man whom he believed to be pjaying un
fairly. He persuaded another one of the
players to change places with him, and
by this ruse obtained ji seat at the table
directly opposite the man he was watch
ing. The watcher declares he saw the
suspected player slip a card from the
bottom of the deck in a jackpot draw.
With a quick movement and before the
hand could be lifted, the watcher reached
across and pinned the five cards to the
table. me dealer. deeply confused
seemed to be unable to speak for a mo
ment. The other -four gentlemen gasped
with astonishment and waited for an ex
planation.
'â¢When the cards were cut," said the
gentleman who was still holding the five
p ctfcboards to the taole, "I caught a
glimpse of the bottom card. It was the
queen of clubs. In helping your hand I
saw you slip the card from the bottom
It Is the uppermost one of these cards
that I stopped you from picking up. If
that card is not the queen of clubs, and
if it does not improve your hand, I will
apologise to you and to the gentlemen
present and I will resign from the Man
hattan Club. If it is tne queen of clubs
I will insist that you leave the club."
The cards were then turned face up
ward on the table and were found to be
five clubs, with the queen of clubs the
one drawn to complete the flush.
All six of the players were on their feet.
One of them slipped across the room an^
locked the door.
The suspected player finally admitted
that he had pursued unfair ' methods
Paper, pens and ink were sent for and
his resignation was immediately drawn
and signed.

chestra was faultless. Seppilli handled the
orchestra in skillful manner, and, with the
soloists, received due reward of applause.
Enjoyed a Musical Feast.
All in all, last night's performance of
"Traviata" was one of the best heard in
San Francisco in twenty years. Those
who heard it enjoyed a musical feast,
while those who should have listened to
it will regret their absence when they

RATHBUN ADDS
TO HIS STORY
Says His Wife at Little
Rock Knew of Plan
to Swindle.
LOUISVILLLE, Ky., Nov. 13.â New
features to-day in the case of Newell C.
Rathbun, held here on a charge of deser
tion from the united States Army, and
suspected of the murder of Charles Good
man, who was found dead last Thursday
in a Jeffersonville, Ind., hotel, were Rath
bun's statement to the police that his wife
at Little Rock had known of his plan to
defraud the insurance company, though
not of th*e murder feature of it; the de
cision to have the corpse of the supposed
Goodman returned to Jeffersonville for
an autopsy and identification; the an
nouncement from Washington that the
War Department had directed to send
Rathbun to Jeffersonville and turn him
over to the Indiana authorities, and the
refusal of the local authorities to send
Rathbun to Little Rock to testify at the
Coroner's inquest over the corpse that
was shipped there. They say Rathbun will
go nowhere except to Jeffersonville, where
he is to be tried on the charge of murder
ing Charles Goodman. A telegram was
sent to Little Rock to-da"y, asking. th;it
the corpse be returned to Jeffersonvillle.
A telegram has been received from the
Chief of Police of Evansville, Ind., stating
that Goodman was a resident of Cripple
Creek, Col., where he was a brass worker.
When asked for his opinion as to the
claim made by Mrs. Rathbun that the
corpse shipped to Little Rock was that
of her husband, Rathbun laughed and re
marked:
"Maybe it is his corpse."
ThiÃ is all be would say on the subject.
Dr. Benson Little of Jeffersonville, who
was present at the autopsy upon Good
man's body, says he will swear that laud
anum was in Goodman's stomach in large
quantities.
The Louisville police to-day began send
ing all over the United States photo
graphs and a description of Rathbun, in
an effort to positively identify him.

Football Game Receipts.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 13.â
Treasurer Edwards of the Associated
Students says that the receipts from the

ball game last Saturday approximate
$19,000. This shows a falling off of $6000
from the amount taken in at last year's
game on Thanksgiving day, the receipts
then being $25,195. While the amount re

last, the mutual expenses of the two uni

RELATIVES SEEK
ELOPING COUPLE
O. E. Howard Is Being
Sought For by Po
lice of This City.
An eloping couple from Colusa are being
sought for by the police of this city.
Their names are Clarence Eugene How
ard and Lottie Shields, a prepossessing
young woman, who has not passed her
eighteenth year. Miss Shields Is the
niece of Mrs. Jane Baker,' a prominent
resident of Colusa.
Some time ago Howard, who is de
scribed as a gay Lothario, arrived in Co
lusa and was given employment by the
electric light company of that city. He
was introduced to Miss Shields, and, ac
cording to the dispatch in the hands of
Captain Seymour, he fell desperately in
love with her. He was a frequent visitor
at her home and she seemed to have re- j
ciprocated his affections.
Last Monday, the young woman was
sent by her aunt to buy some medicine
lor Mr. Baker, who was sick. After re
turning she was in tears, and when asked
for an explanation of her grief said that
the druggist from whom sne bought the
medicine had informed her that hor
brother was down with typhoid fever and
that she feit it her duty to go to his bed
side. Mrs. Baker, not suspecting any
thing wrong, told her to go and not re
turn all night in case her brother was
seriously ill.
Taking her wrap and some other fem
inine apparel with her, the young woman
after kissing her aunt good-by. left pre
sumably for her parents' home. As she
did not return the following day Mrs.
Baker became suspicious and started an
investigation. To her intense surprise
she learned that Miss Shields, instead of
returning to her home to nurse her sup
posed sick brother, had eloped with How
ard. Subsequent developments showed
that the young woman, after leaving the
home of her aunt, met Howard by prear
rangement and together they djove to
Marysville.
As they purchased tickets for this city
the police are satisfied that the elopers
are here, notwithstanding that the regis
ters of the various hotels and lodging
houses fail to reveat their names. As the
girl is under age it is the intention of her
relatives to have Howard arrested. Cap
tain Seymour last night said that he was
satisfied that Howard is in this city and
that he was likely to be arrested at any
minute.

Entire Production Is
Rendered in a Pure
and Faultless Style
Audience Remains Till
Fail of the Cur
tain in the Last Act
Blanche Partington
I HARDLY know where and how to
begin to express my sense of the
beauty of last evening's performance
of "La Traviata'" at the Grand
Opera-house. The house was com- |
paratively light, but be it understood
these who missed last night's opera
missed one of the greatest performances j
all round that has ever been givenâany
where, one might venture to say. One
cannot afford to miss anything Mr. Grau
offers, though in comparing one perform
ance with another, he naturally is not al
ways on the same level. But they are all
richly worth hearing, and a thousand
times more than we exiles from the artis
tic latitudes have any right to expect, j
But last night's opera so far "takes the
cake"â l should say if I dared, and I will
dareâ and mostly through the vivid charm
and incomparable vocalism of Marcella j
Sembrich. Not even the greatest ad
mirers of Verdi's genius claim any special
eminence for -'.La Traviata," and most
folks look upon it, with not too striking
injustice, simply as a vehicle for the ex- j
hibition of the lyric soprano's vocal ma
chinery, bXit "L-a Traviata" has its raison
d'etre so long as there is Marcella Sem
brich to sing it. That Mme. Sembrich and
her gifted conferes should have made of
the material the pure and perfect gem
that they gave us last night is, therefore,
the more remarkable, and it is surely now j
ranged with the never-to-be-forgotten
things of one's experience.
Sembrich is incomparable. I do not
thin... there is anywhere a singer who can
touch her in the pure art of bel canto.
She sings with laughable ease, the lucent,
silken notes rippnng forth without the
slightest appearance of effort. Vv hat is
it Meredith says of the lark? "He drops
the silvery chain of sound of many links
without a break." The Meredith melody
sounds like Sembrich's scales, and those
gorgeous trills that end the first act in a
joyous ripple. Larkhke in its purity the
singer's voice is and the most periectly
used vocal instrument that I have ever
heard. It is clear as a bell, it has the
flute qualityâ a flute in love! It has every
beauty that one can imagine in the most
beautiful of all instruments, the human
voice, and to hear it is the greatest priv
ilege for the student of singing that is
likely to come his way for moons a
many. Nor is this all. Sembrich has
charm and fascination as an actress, and
she seems one of the friendliest creatures
that ever smiled at an audience. She
was immediately en rapport with the \
house that encored her insistently after
the first curtain went down and did her
the unusual honor to forget its hat until
the last elate, liquid note floated across j
the footlights. Sembrich roused the house
as houses have not been roused by any
singer since Patti's time, and she is un
doubtedly the biggest vocal fact of the
present grand opera season. Those who
heard the singer in "II Barbiere ' on the \
occasion of her last visit here are de- I
lighted to find their prophesies fulfilled, j
ana Sembrich's next appearance will i
probably be the signal for an old-time
ovation. She responded most graciously
to the clamorous encore that followed the
first act's close, and also came out to
bow acknowledgment to an insistent final
curtain call.
It was Mr. Salignac'- first appearance
lait night, and he did excellent work in
the not too grateful part of Alfredo. Mr.
Sallgnac's voice is not wholly pleasing.
It has a certain reediness of quality that
sometimes offends, and neither is it al
ways exactly .on pitch, but the voice is
sympathetic and powerful, and the sing
er has an ample dramatic sense that lift
ed his part to distinction last night. His
concerted work with Mme. Sembrtth was
intimately sympathetic, the ensemble
being almost perfect. Salignac improved
steadily with the progress of the opera,
and his last efforts were quite worthy of
th j distinguished company in which he
found himself. Campanari was the Ger
mont of the evening, and though the part
is not one that strongly calls out hts
peculiar genius, the favorite barytone
was an admirable figure. Mme. Van Cau
teren and Miss Bauermeister did useful
and artistic service as Flora and An
nina,Â» and Gilibert. Vanni, Dufriche and
Bars undertook the rest of the parts with
amply satisfactory results.
Seppilliâ whom, I find, I wrote "Flon"
on Tuesday eveningâ conflucted to ad
miration, witlr-spirit, power and precision,
and the chorus work was excellent
throughout. The first violin got an un
accustomed hand, by the way. for a de
licious little intermezzo before the second
act. played with much grace of feeling,
and the whole orchestra was entirely de
lightful. So ends the third chapter of the
grand opera season, and like Oliver Twist
we now ask for more. To-nijeht we enter
again the Waerner domain with "Tann
hauser" and Eames, Scheff. Reuss-Belce,
Van Dyck, Bispham and Blass are of the
company.
ISSUES AN" APPEAL
TO GRAIN-GROWERS
George "W. Pierce Urges Them to
Become Members of the State
Association.
MADERA. Nov. 13.â George W. Pierce,
chairman of the recent convention of
grain growers in Sacramento, has issued
an address to the farmers of California.
They are urged to become members of the
association of grain growers, having for
its chief object the obtaining of lower
, freight rates on California grain shipped
to foreign markets. The fee assessed upon
each person who joins is but $5. Chairman
Pierce says:
"W. F. Ford and others are now canvassing
the State, and I earnestly beg that you give
them your names and subscriptions. Every
thoughtful man realizes that unless relief Is
given the grain growers, and that speedily,
grain growing in California will soon suffer
serious curtailment In organization only dots
there seem to be any prospect of relief. It is
hoped that by January, 1902. the preliminary
work will Cc completed, and then a conventfon
will be called of all subscribing farmers for
the puipose of perfecting an organization.
At that convention it is proposed to take
such legal steps as are necessary to form an
organization of those California grain growers
who have subscribed and paid So each under
the terms of the circular issued by the con
ventinn held on September 23 last. The object
ot thPt association will be to secure lower
freight rates on grain. This it Is proposed to
do by obtaining bonds and contracts fron.
grain growers until at least one-third of the
wheat crop can be diverted to such route or
I routes as will transport the grain at lowest
rates. These contracts, it Is believed, should
not be made for a longer term than five years
Having thus in our control a large amount
of freight we will be in a posit ->n to secure
the best possible freight rates.

American Consul's Conduct
Likely to Cause Bulgaria
to Escape Liability.
BERLIN, Nov. 13.â The Cologne GazetU
to-day contains a dispatch from Sofia.
Bulgaria, saying that it is feared that
Miss Ellen M. Stone, the American mis
sionary in the hands of the brigands, ha*
been murdered, owing to the delay in thÂ«
payment of her ransom.
SOFIA, Nov. 13.â The Bulgarian offi
cials disclaim any intention to interfere
with Consul General Dickinson's prlvata
negotiations for the release of Miss Stona
from the hands of the brigands, but they
decline to become parties to an agreement
sanctioning brigands or the emissaries of
brigands coming into Bulgarian territory
to treat for the ransom of persons cap
tured in a neighboring State. In defense
of the interests of Bulgaria the offlctala
cannot show weakness toward the bri
gands or repudiate responsibility for thÂ«
consequences. The Government would,
however, respect subject to .certain con
ditions, safe conducts granted by Dickin
son personally to private emissaries. It is
suggested that Dickinson give the bandns
a fixed tfme in which to accept thÂ«
amount as the only means of bringing the
matter to a conclusion, inasmuch as th*
prestige of the United States is injured
by the present inconsequent negotiations.
Selling Stale News.
Hardly a day passes without person*
calling at the hotel where Dickinson ana
the newspaper correspondents are stay

case. This is either stale or fabrication-*.
A Greek priest yesterday introduced
himself with the statement that he had
met a Turkish officer with Miss Stone ani
Madame Tsilka near Pjummiabaia. He
added that the woman asked him to tell
people that he had seen them. This nc

WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â Sach infor
mation as comes to the State Department
from Sofia and Constantinople is confirm
atory of the press reports of Dickinson *
negotiations with the Bulgarian Govern
ment touching Miss Stone's case. It .3
believed that the Consul- General s efforts
to secure Miss Stones release by negotia
tions with the brigands without interfer
ence by the Bulgarian Government will
be successful. It Is apprehended, howeve-.
that through his declination to permit
the Bulgarian Government to exert lU|
police authority to effect the capture ot

solved that Government from any legal
liability on account of the amount of
money which must bÂ« paid over as ran

All observant physicians have noticed the

approval to the new internal renaÂ«3y,
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, as the most
successful and by far the safest remedy
for catarrh yet produced.
One well known catarrh specialist, as
soon as he had' made a thorough test of
this preparation, discarded inhalers,
washes and sprays and now depends en-
tirely upon Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
treating catarrh, whether In the head,
throat or stomach.
. Dr. Risdell says: "In patlent3 who had
lost the sense of smell entirely and even,
where the hearing has begun to be affect-
ed from catarrh I have had fine results
lifter only a few weeks' use of Stuart';*
Catarrh Tablets. I can only explain their
action on the theory that â¢ the cleandin^

I destroy the catarrhal germs wherever
I lound, because I have found the tablets

COWARDLY CRIME
Shoots Hunting Com
panion in the Back
and Robs Him.
Wounded Victim Saves His
Life in Desperate Fight
With Assassin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Nov. Murder was at
tempted and robbery committed on a
lonely mountain trail near the little min
ing town of Guadalupe, fourteen miles
southwest of this city, last night, and
Frank Newman of San Francisco is in the
County Jail charged with the crimes. M.
C Arps, the third mate of the steamer
Newport, which arrived at San Francisco
ten days ago from Panama, was his in
tended victim. That Arps is alive to tell
the story is no fault of Newman's, but
due simply to his own grit. That New
man intended to murder his man is shown
by the fact that when in rifling his vic
tim's pockets he discovered Arps was not
dead he started to reload his gun to shoot
again. Then Arps, by almost superhuman
efforts, obtained possession of his rifle
and fired at Newman, who ran away.
When arrested Newman had Arps' gold
watch and chain and $9 in his possession.
He admitted having shot Arps.
The attempt at murder and robbery was
a cowardly affair. Arps, who had gone
to the ranch of his nephew, Chris Raich,
near Guadalupe, to rest a few days, met
Newman, who was living with Joe Gildea
on an adjoining ranch. Yesterday after
noon the two started hunting together.
They went as far as Frohm, where Arps
treated his friend. About 5:30 o'clock
they started home together, and when
on a trail near the ranches where they
stopped Newman fell behind his friend
and shot him from behind, the charge of
shot striking him in the side and neck.
Fires a Second Time. s
Arps fell and Newman, standing over
him, emptied the other barrel of the gun
at the prostrate man, the shot grazing
Arps' face. Newman searched Arps'
pockets, taking his watch and chain and
Â«K< in mon?y.
Newman then returned to the ranch
where he was staying, end a few hours
later his conscience evidently troubled
him, for he procured n horse *.nd rode
into Guadalupe and surrendered himselt
to Deputy Sneriff PeSaye. who brought
him to the County Jail h*re at an early
hour this morning. In efvi;y? himself up
Newman declared that *Wps hud at
tempted to hold him u;\ anC that iie hMI
fired in defense. Sine riien is has con
tradicted himself and tried to pass the
tffair off as a drunken row.
M. C. Arps, the wounded man. was re
moved to the County Hospital to-day.
After he was shot he dragged hint it! f to
the Raich ranch. He was very weai I'rom
loss of blood and fainted six tixne-b on the
trail. He will recover.
Victim's Story of the Crime.
Arps' story of the crime makes it out
to have been an unusually cold-blooded
affair. He said he met Newman yester
day afternoon, and the latter invited him
to go rabbit hunting. Arps carried a
rifle and Newman a shotgun. They went
as far as Frohm, where they had a couple
of drinks.
"On my way back, just before the crime
occurred," says Arps, "Newman dropped
behind. A few seconds later he shot me,
the charge striking me in the shoulder and
face. I fell and he ran up to me. I was
conscious all the time, and saw from the
way he acted that he intended to rob me
I had changed a $10 piece in the Frohm
saJoon. and he evidently believed I had
more money. Seeing that he intended to
rob. I lay perfectly still, so he would be
lieve I was dead. Standing over me, he
tired another shot that grazed my face
and cut some of the flesh away.
"Newman then searched my pockets.
He hurt me in doing so, and I moved
Newman noticed this, and after getting
my watch and chain, started to put two
more cartridges into his gun, evidently
intending to finish me. Then I realize.!
it was a case cf fight or die. Staggering
to my feet, I picked up a rock, which I
threw at him. Newman was afraid of
me and ran into the brush. Finally I
found my rifle and fired a shot in the d' Â¦
rection he had fled."
Newman's Queer Account. ,
Newman, who is but 19Â» years old has
parents residing at 673 Harrison street.
San Francisco. For awhile he was em
ployed as a teamster by Redington &
Co. On October 22 he went to GuadalupÂ«
to spend rome time with Joe Gildea a
friend of his. He declares ho was intox
icated at the time of the shooting, and
does not know why he did it. When
brought to the jail Newman was sober,
so his story of being intoxicated is not
borne out.
To-day he said: "Arps was about
twenty feet ahead of me when I pulled
my gun up and shot. I don't know why I
did it, for I had no reason to. He had
not threatened me, nor pointed a gun at
me. As soon as I realized what I had
done I went an-I looked at him. I thought
him dead. Then I thought some one
would come along and rob the body and
accuse me of robbery, so I took his
watch and money. $9 45, intending to turn
it over to the officers when I surren
dered."
Newman tells several conflicting stories
He says he was never in trouble before,
except to be arrested for disturbing the
peace. â¢ /

DERANGED MIND
PROMPTS SUICIDE
Joseph Has Brouck Ends
His Life at Kent
Station.
Mental Trouble Due to Over
work Responsible for
the Tragedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 13.â While suffer
ing from an attack of mental trouble,
Joseph Has Brouck, a respected resident
of this county, committed suicide in his
home at Kent Station at 10 o'clock this
morning. Has Brouck gave no warning
as to his intentions, but went to one of
the numerous log cabins on his premises
and, taking a shotgun, fired the fatal
shot. He had placed the muzzle of the
gun in his mouth and a terrible wound
resulted. Has Brouck had been very ill
for more than a year past. Overwork
and the need of rest wrecked his nervous
system.
Mr. Has Brouck was 62 years old and
well known in San Francisco. He was
connected with the Bancroft-Whitney
Law Publishing Company. He is sur
vived by a widow. His estate is large,
consisting of personal and real property.
Joseph Has Brouck had been leading
man in the firm of Sumner, Whitney &
Co. for years, when in 1885 it was consol
idated with Bancroft & Co. into the pres
ent firm of the Bancroft-Whitney Com
pany, of which he was a principal stock
holder, secretary and one of the three act
ive managers. He was married seven or
eight years ago to Miss Angenette Moyle.
He was a member of the Bohemian Club,
the Unitarian Club, and the Chit-Chat
Club, the well-known literary organiza
tion.
A year ago Mr. Has Brouck was strick
en with nervous prostration from over
work and too close application to busi
ness. He was given a year's leave of
absence, beginning the first of last De
cember, on full pay. Six months ago ho
resigned the secretaryship on account of
continued ill health.
F. P. Stone, president of the Bancroft-

TIMBER WOLVES
TREE TWO MEN
Maintain Their Vigil for
a Day and a
Half.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
yANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 13.â Treed by
wolves for a day and a half was the re
markable experience of two Vancouver
prospectors who have just arrived from
the north. The men were Francis John
stone and R. Rankin, who have been
working all summer in various places in
the north. They came down from the in
terior and crossed over the channel to
Princess Royal Island. From the coast
they started packing supplies to a mine
on the mountain and it was while car
rying fresh meat that they were attacked
and were forced to run for their lives
from the wolves.
There were a score of large timber
wolves in the pack, and the men had only
time to run to the foot of a tree and
swing up into its branches. The wolves
tore their packs to pieces and a few min
utes later not a vestige of even the leather
straps remained. The men shouted at the
brutes and tried all kinds of ruses to
scare them away, but the animals only
sat on their haunches or shifted their po
sition from one side of the tree to the
other.
A snowstorm raged for several hours
and a heavy wind followed, but the
wolves still kept up their vigil through
the night and the next day. Hungry and
tired as the men were they dared not
move. That morning, however, their em
ployer at the camp started out to look for
them and finally rescued them, after
shooting a number of the wolves.

BOBMA2T E. NOGGLE
TAXES CABBOLIC ACID
Fon of an Oakland Citizen Commits
Suicide Because He Is Out of
Funds.
OLTMPIA, "Wash., Nov. 13.â Borman
E. Noggrle, who registered from San
Francisco at the Olympia Hotel on Mon
day, committed suicide by taking: car
bolic acid some time during last night.
Not having been seen during the day,
the proprietor called him for dinner. Get
ting no response, he entered the room
and found Nog^le lying dead on the bed.
Two empty carbolic acid bottles were on
the table. No money was found, but
there were several letters from Noggle's
father, written on United States Mint
letterheads from San Francisco and
signed "D. L. N."
Noggle was apparently 26 years of age
and had on his person a number of pawn
tickets for goods nawned in Seattle. He
had asked his father for money and the
letters indicate that the latter refused to
send it. The father resides in Oakland.
Noggle is a son of Borman L. Noggle,
who holds the position of receiving clerk
in the I'nited States Mint in this city. The
family is well known in Oakland, but re
moved to this side of the bay a few days
ago.

OF HOTEL CORONADO'S HOSPITALITY
Visiting Railroad Men Tender Handsome Souvenirs to Three Popu

ment Accorded Them -While Traveling to the Golden State
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 13.â The delegates
to the American Association of
Traveling Passenger Agents ar
rived her.c this evening on a spe
cial train from Los Angeles. They
closed their convention yesterday and will
now spend a short time visiting points on
the coast before leaving for their homes
in the East.
Manager E. S. Babcock tendered the
railroad men a reception and ball in the
Hotel Coronado this evening. One pleas
ant feature of the evening was the pres
entation of handsome souvenirs to George
H. Nicholson, passenger traffic manager:
J. J. Byrne, general passenger agent of
the lines west of Albuquerque, and Jere
miah Black, general passenger agent of
the Santa Fe main lines. These jolly rail
road men have done much to make the
traveling passenger agents' trip a success
and the Easterners' appreciation was
shown in the applause that went up when
President Garrigan gave them the pres
ents.
Before leaving Los Angeles to-day the
entire party was taken in special cars to
Santa Monica. Many of the men em
braced the opportunity of going in surf
bathing. All were tendered a luncheon in
Santa Monica by the Los Angeles com
mittee of traveling passenger agents be
fore leaving the beach.
The programme for to-morrow includes
a trip to Tia Juana, Mexico. All are
anxious to make the journey. On return

BLITZEN SWAMP
TO BE DRAINED
Lair of Wild Animals
Will Be Given Over
to Farming.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 13.â The French-Glenn
Livestock Company of Glenn County cap
italists, of which F. C. Lusk of Chico is
the general manager, is working on a
dredger with which to dig a ditch to
drain the great Blitzen swamp in Ore
gon. The swamp, which has been the
habitation of wild beasts for ages, is a
wilderness of Harney County. It 1b
twenty-five miles long by five to seven
miles broad, and when drained it is esti
mated 60,000 acres of grazing and hay
producing land will be available. The
company has 75,000 head of cattle, besides
many horses.
In its present state Blitzen swamp is
valueless, save as a hunting ground. It
contains more ducks, geese, swans and
pelicans, ornithologists say, than any
other spot of like area on the globe.
Myriads of birds arise whenever a gun
is fired. There are thousands of acres of
absolutely impenetrable thickets, where
live huge bears and mountain lions that
prey on the deer and antelope that
abound in the open spots. The swamp is
rich in fossil remains of extinct beasts,
showing that it has been inhabited by ani
mals for ages. Many specimens have been
dug up and carried away, and persons
acquainted with the locality say that the
draining of the swamp will disclose many
interestins fossils.
Fifty thousand dollars will be spent on
the work. The ditch is to be dredged
sixty feet wide by nine deep. It will fol
low the course of the Blitzen River for
thirty miles and empty into Malheur
Lake.

"I don't want to stay," growled the

CINNABAR CAMP
Trinity County Mining
Works Are Wholly
Destroyed.
Settlement Surrounding Al
toona Property Lies in
Ruins.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 13.â Fire has swept
Cinnabar, Trinity County, off the map.
Of the mining camp and plant nothing re
mains standing but the hoisting works,
and that is damaged. The loss will ap
proximate $75,000.
The fire occurred yesterday morning.
Meager news of It came to-day in a let
ter from Superintendent J. H. Porter.
The blaze started .from the furnace.
Cinnabar waa built about the noted Al
toona quicksilver mine. Several months
ago all work was stopped at the mine.
The ore had been extracted from the up
per workings and the lower levels could
not. be worked until the water In them
was reduced, which process would prove
very expensive. A large number of men
had been employed and an extensive camp
maintained. In addition to the .machinery
and the machine houses, tramway and
appurtenances, the office buildings, board
ing-houses, bunkhouses, residences, store,
blacksmith shop, saloon and other build
ings and their furnishings were destroyed.
There were only a few persons at the
camp.
It is difficult to arrive at the exact loss.
Seven years ago the property owned by
the company was insured for more than
$30,000 and was probably worth more than
$50,000. The improvements added since
that time will bring the loss up to at
least $75,000, and it may be considerably
more.
The Altoona has produced a fortune In
its time.
Brieadier General Merriam Retires.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13.â 1n conse
quence of his retirement Brigadier Gen
eral Merriam was relieved formally of
the command of the Department of the
Colorado to-day. Telegraphic instructions
were sent to Colonel J. N. Sanno of the
Eighteenth Infantry, the next ranking
officer, to assume command of the de
partment until a regular detail can be
made. It is understood in Washington
that Major General Mac Arthur is to be
given command of the department about
January 1, as his service upon the brevet
board expires about that time. Colonel
Sanno, who is now at Fort D. A. Rus
sell, Wyoming, will proceed at ofice to
the quarters of the department at
Denver.
BIG EARTHQUAKE
SHAKES UP UTAH
Shock Lasts Fully Half
a Minute in Some
Localities.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Nov. 13.â Specials
to the Herald from various points in
Southern Utah give meager accounts of
a severe earthquake shock, which oc
curred shortly after 9:30 o'clock to-night.
The shock, which lasted fully thirty sec
onds in some places, created general con
sternation among the inhabitants. The
vibrations were northeast to southwest.
Telegraphic communication to the dis
trict affected is very limited and full de
tails will not be known until to-morrow
So far as reported no loss of life and
comparatively little damage to property
resulted.
At Oasis, in Millard County, the people
rushed into the streets expecting their
homes to collapse.
At Beaver, in Beaver County, the shock
damaged the county court house and a
number of other residences.
A slight shock was felt in this city at
9:37 p. m., but was not severe enough to
be generally noticeable.
Illness of Holland's Queen.
BERLIN, Nov. 13.â The Kolnische Zelt
ung to-day says that the Queen of Hol
land is suffering from premature confine
ment, adding that there is no cause for
alarm.
The Vossische Zeitung says it learns
that Queen Wilhelmina w^is prematurely
delivered of a child November 10, and that
the Queen's condition is satisfactory.
lsh a large trust company here which
will do a banking business and provide
means for financing large American un
dertakings, these being continually grow
ing in importance. Present Mexican
legislation does not contemplate trust
companies as they are known in the
United States, and there will have to be
extensive changes made in existing laws
to give full sco^e to a trust company.
These steps, it is now said, are under
consideration by the government. It is
understood that this country's business
development has reached a point where
trust companies are necessary.
Old established banking interests resent
the increase of American financial influ
eTice and will probably make opposition to
changing the :aws so as to make them
favorable to the new American financial
project. However, the administration is
not hostile to American business interests
and will probably favor a large trust com
pany, which will surely assume an im
portant place in the banking world here.

SAILOR TOM SHARKEY AGREES TO FIGHT THE WINNER
OF THE GREAT CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE NEXT MONTH
CHAMPION JEFFRIES' WEIGHT LOWER
THAN WAS GENERALLY EXPECTED
Still Continues His Work on the Road and in Reliance Club Gym
nasium, While His Opponent Is Resting With the Idea of
Storing Up All the Vitality Possible for To-Morrow Night
SAILOR TOM SHARKEY has been
heard from. In answer to a tele
gram sent him by Manager Ken
nedy of the Twentieth Century
Athletic Club, offering him a
fight with the winner of to-morrow
night's battle, he agrees to meet the win
ner on December 20. Sharkey will start
for this city within a few days. The
match is as good as made if the fight to
morrow night is as great a success as is
expected.
After finishing his exercising yesterday
James J. Jeffries, champion heavyweight
pugilist of the world, tipped the scales at
286% pounds. He was elated over his low
weight. Jeffries believes he can fight to
better advantage when he weighs about
207 pounds. His trainer, "Billy" Delaney,
is of a different opinion. He would rather
have his protege enter the ring weighing
about 215 or 217 pounds, as he knows that
in the course of a heated battle Jim will
take off weight.
"When I fought Fitzsimmons.'* said Jef
fries yesterday, "I weighed 207 pounds.
I was as fast as chain lightning and felt
as if I could fight all night. Now that I
have reached within a few pounds of that
weight I know and feel satisfied that I
am in the best condition."
"I would rather have Jim fight at about
215," said Delaney. "When Corbett fought
Fitzsimmons at Carson he was down too
fine and when he had gone half the dis
tance he 'blew up.' I want Jim to go in
weighing about 215 and I am sure he will
do so. The reason he is down to 208. is
because of the heavy work he did to-day.
He will rest to-morrow and will take on
a few extra pounds. I am perfectly satis
fied with Jeffs condition. He is trained
to the hour and is in condition to put up
a fast fight."
Prominent business and professional
men of Oakland watched Jim work in the
gymnasium of the Reliance Club yester
day morning. The boilermaker did no
boxing and will do none until the gong
sounds to-morrow evening. He punched
the bag for fully twenty minutes and
only had to stop when he made the bag
collapse with a heavy smash. He danced
all over the ring feinting at an imagin
ary opponent, worked the rowing ma
chine, chest weights and did other stunts.
In the afternoon Jeffries donned his
heavy clothes and took his last run on
the road. He was accompanied by his
brother Jack and a friend on bicycles.
Jim walked the first five miles at a "brisk
pace to open his pipes. The last three
he ran. At first he went a little faster
than a "dog" trot. When two miles from
home the cyclists let out a link and the
big fellow took larger strides. An elec
tric car came along and Jim used it as
pace. He spurted for two blocks and
then returned to his usual run. During
the running he kept up a conversation.
He breathed freely and without effort
When he returned to the gymnasium
Jeff said his legs were stronger than evei
before and he did not feel tired
He was examined by Dr. William Coop
er Eidenmuller. physician of the Twen
tieth Century Club. "Jack" Gleason. a
representative of the club, brought the
medico over. After thoroughly examining
Jeffries the doctor paid he was in perfect
condition and was not suffering from or
sanic trouble. This dissipates the sensa
tional story that Jim had an enlarged
heart.
To-day Jeffries will do light work in the
Reliance Club gymnasium. A number of
ladies of Oakland have been invited to
watch him perform.

Gus was as happy as a schoolboy on the

Martin poked th<=> big fellow playfully
in the ribs and said: "There you are. Gup.

Ruhlin stood up as straight as an ar
row and twitched every muscle in his
body. The sinew? tugged and strained
the massive muscles of Kuhlin's legs, and
so well were they developed that the
natural muscular movement resembled
the erratic twitching of a muscle under
the strain of electricity. Ruhlin is cer
tainly tit to engage in a bout with the
champion of champions.
Late in the afternoon Ruhlin and Billy
Madden retired to the privacy of the lat

and his party spent the host part of an
hour working on the new blow, and when

son between the operation of the two ays
tems. He said to-day that the compari
son is greatly to the advantage of the
government vessels. Nevertheless, it is
claimed that the use of the commercial
vessels would mean a considerable sav
ing of money to the government, and it
is probable that this view will eventually
result in the decision to sell the trans
ports and use the private steamship lines.
The especial difficulty in the way of this
action is the making of provision for the
care of the sick. On the government
transports the convalescents returning
from tho Philippines are tenderly treated
and surgeons and nurses look after their
â¢wants. Thn officers opposed to the trans
port system say that no difficulty in car
ing for the Pick has been experienced in
the transportation of patients from Cuba
and Porto Rico and none will arise in
the Pacific.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1901.
that the proof of the pudding was in the
er.ting and that to-morrow night Gus
would tender Jeff a morsel of new pugi
listic pudding that would surprise not
only Jeff but ether good judges of the
boxing game.
While there has been no new punches
added to the usual fistic routine since
Fitzsimmons sprung his famous solar
plexus blow on Corbett in their fight at
Carson it is not impossible or improbable
either that Ruhlin may have studied out
something that will create an upheaval
in pugdom.
Of course stories of new blows and other
innovations about to be palmed off on
the public for the first time in a world
championship battle look well in print
and it helps the interest some, but at the
same time those who figure that way
must take into consideration the fact that
there is always a chance for improvement
in any sport and the fertile brain of Billy
gladden may have figured out a blow that
will beat the champion. At all events
Ruhlin actually spends one hour every
day practicing in the privacy of Maddens
room. If he has discovered something
that will set fistiana a-gossiping the box
ing-loving public will be let into the
secret to-morrow night.
Ruhlin will not leave Blanken's until
to-morrow evening. He will be attended
by Billy Madden, Denver Ed Martin,
Young Gibbs and Charlie Goff.
Gus was weighed yesterday in the pres
ence of several witnesses. He tipped the
scales at 201 V?. pounds. Ruhlin weighed 211
pounds the day he commenced training
for the big fight. Ruhlin managed to
bring himself to his present weight by
taking off weight one day and building
himself the next two or three. This sys
tem has made Ruhlin as hard as a rock
Billy Madden is not satisfied with the
truth of the report that Jeffries only
weighs 210 pounds. He says he is willing
to wager that the champion will tip the
beam close to (he 225-pound mark
"You can say for me that I am in the
best possible physical shape," said Ruh
lin. "I am going into this fight with all
the confidence in the world. I firmly be
lieve I will win, and if T don't it wil! be
because Jeff is a better man. I am in
shape to fight the battle of my life and
that I will attempt to do when" I face the
champion.

ALL-STAR TEAM
FOR OLYMPICS
Dazzling Array of Foot
ball Talent for the
Coming Game.
Prospect? are bright for a sensational
game of football in this city on Thanks
giving- day between athletic club teams,
strongrly reinforced by college players. I.
J. Muma, manager of the Olympic Club
tpam. has a list of twenty-five players
from which the representatives of the
flying "O" will be chosen. These include:
AVomble. Masters and Barnard, for end
positions; Pringle. Clay. Embrick and
Young-, tackles; Oadwalader (captain),
Plunkett. Overall and Stow, guards; Betti
son and Gendotti. center; Thane. Kerfoot
More and Hudson, quarterback; Slaker
of Stanford, Duden, Romaine and Rithet
fullbacks; Gammon. Horan. Mini Whip
pie and Sherman, backs. If that would
not provide an all-star cast it would be
difficult to secure one.
For Reliance these are possibilities-
Fickert, McMillan, Smith, Oliver Wiers'
McNevin, Collins. Hamilton, Barker'
Nourse, Lee. Cavanaugh, Wilson, Varney'
Dinsmore. Hil! and Fisher. y*â¢ey,
"Dave" Brown spent yesterday at Palo
Alto, and invited other players to join the
Reliance forces, and expects to Eecure
some of them.
Reserved seats for the game will cost
$1. and the management promises better
facilities for handling the spectators than
were in vogue last Saturday at the inter
collegiate game.
That there is no lack of interest in foot
ball is shown by the attendance last Sat
urday. The receipts reached $19,000. The
inclement weather and the fact of the
game not being played on a holiday re
duced the attendance slightly. The re
HARD COURSING
BEATS SISQUOC
The Petaluma Greyhound
Gets Some Severe
Running.
For Glory Seems a Likely
Candidate for the Stake
Honors.
PETALUMA, Nov. 13.â D. J. Healey's
greyhound Sisquoc is no longer a factor
in the open plains meeting, though
he is the most talked of courser in Peta
luma. A gamer and more determined ex
hibition than that put up by Healey'a
champion it is safe to say has never been
seen on any field. Sisquoc opened up a
10 to 1 favorite against his half-brother,
the despised Slim, and ran an "unde
cided" course after a close call. His
price was cut in two and another "unde
cided" brought the odds to 2 to 1. Then
in a heart-breaking course Sisquoc cap
tured the flag.
No one looked for the great courser to
come back, but his owner sent him to
the slips again to try against Miss Wil
son to get another killing run. Sisqucx;
came back virtually a dead one. but went
the route again. This time St. Ives was
his opponent. A hare fresh from the San
Joaquin plains was turned loose and the
dogs sent in pursuit. It was here that
Sisquoc showed his gameness. Across the
field and so far away that the dogs could
hardly be seen the hare took the pair on
the long journey. How Healey's dog
kept in the running was a surprise, but
he was there and at the finish was piling
up points, finally scoring the kill, but los
ing the course on points.
toacramento Boy at one time looked to
have a chance to reach the final, but in
a short course with Tiburon in the third
round he put himself out by scoring his
first points in the kill, while .his opponent
had three to his credit.
The day's sport was first class, and the
new lot of hares gave the dogs many
long, hard runs. A, J. Martin, thougn
having severe going, is a likely candidate
for stake honors, especially if he can
beat Tiburon in his first course in the
morning. Aeolus ran a great race, as did
Tom Hurlick. It is not believed that St.
Ives can recover from his last course suf
ficiently to offset these fast ones. For
Glory, with but little work to tell against
her, is in a position to make a good
showing.
Liberator beat Chicago Boy at 4 to 1,
Sleety Mist beat Roman Athlete, Royal

WILL NOT PLAY PRINCETON.
Berkeley Men Decline to Again Un
dergo Severe Training.
BERKELEY. Nov. 13.â N0 football game
will be held between the University of
California and Princeton. That matter
was definitely settled to-day by the execu
tive committee of the student body, which
voted against the proposition. Princeton's
offer was declined because the California
football men do not feel like undertakinj
another period of training. They win
the time between now and the Christmas
vacation to catch up in their studies.
The men did not refuse to' play but de
clared that if the committee proposed to
bring Princeton here they would go into
training again, although at a loss to the.r
own interests. The committee believed
that it would be at too great a sacrifice
to personal interests to have the team
commence hard work again.
During the Christmas vacation the men
will be sent south for games on Christ
mas or New Year, or both. Manage/
Decoto was empowered to make neces
sary arrangements and plans are being
formed to have one game in Los Angeles
and the other in Pasadena with club
teams. No hard practice will be needed
and the men will receive a pleasant out
ing.
Manager Deccto stated that it was un
likely that any alumni team could b-i
got together to play Princeton.
Manager I. J. Muma said last night he
would wire an offer to Princeton on be
half of an All-California team, made up
of p.'ayers from the various teams.
OBIA EASILY DEFEATS ARTICULATE
FOR THE RICH TANFORAN HANDICAP
Meehanus Makes a Fine Run From the Rear, Beating a Cluster of
Fast Onesâ -"Hoodoo" Still Clings to O'Connor, Who Loses
on Four Favorites â Lodestar Fir^t at Most Tempting Quotations
RACING at the track across the
bay is in a flourishing condition.
Sixteen books cut In yesterday,
and as the attendance is daily in
creasing, and there is a volume
of coin to be handled, it is safe to say
that over twenty books will v be on next
week. It was pretty soft picking for the
members of the booking fraternity yes
terday as six straight favorites were
counted out. On four different occasions
Winnie O'Connor finished second, three
being pronounced choices.
About the best morsel on the card was
the Tanforan handicap, over one mile and
a furlong. For this event only five start
ed, and the educated division landed on
Brutal, sending the Brutus horse to the
post with his 104 pounds, an 8 to 5 choice.
The track was slow, and for this reason
many fancied the chances of Articulate.
The latter colt lost over a length at the
start, and Hoar then hustled him away
in the lead. He maintained the front po
sition until less than a furlong from the
stand, where Ransch on Obia tackled him
and at the wire won in rag-time. Brutal
finished in<third place. Obia was not given
any great consideration by the crowd, her
odds receding from 2V4 to 4Vi.
By taking the shortest route home.
Birkenruth got across the line first with
St. Sever in the opening sprint, a neck
ahead of Duckoy, the favorite. Edin
borough was looked upon as the contend
er, but recently has been showing signs
of lameness and cut no figure.
Because of his known liking for a soft
track. Gusto caught a heavy play in *Aa
betting on the third event, closing a
lukewarm favorite. Logue did not make
any great effort on the brown horse,
ending up in last place. King Dellis,
with J. Woods in the saddle,
seemed to have finally fallen in with his
own sort of company, for he beat Saul of
Tarsus a length, closing at odds of 7 to
1. Gibraltar displayed a mild inclination
to try running with show honors.
The vastly Improved Redan captured the
two-year-old handicap in a gallop from
Royalty. The latter, piloted by O'Connor,
received steady support at 2 to 1, while
Id to 5 was laid about Redan. The last
named youngster seemed bubbling over
with speed, Vittatoe having him under
wraps most of the trip. Running away at
the end he finished three lengths in ad
vance of Royalty, with Magi a bang up
third.
Marion Lynch, favorite for the final mile
selling run did not make much of a show
ing. She played quite a prominent part
in the game for nearly half a mile and
then fell back. Castake looked to be win
ning, when Birkenruth dropped along with
the 12 to 1 shot Lodestar, and in a drive
reached the stand first by a trifle more
than a length.
Track Notes.
Billy Connor cut in under the name of
the Oakland Club, booking for Joe Gavin
and some other Denver people.
Paul Ridley's familiar form was oncÂ°
more seen on the block.
Frank O'Rourke thought very well of
The Fretter's chances, but the chestnut
horse warmed up sore, apparently not
having regained his Burns handicap
Vantine narrowly missed kicking two
or three riders while at the post, and
horses of her vicious temperament should
be barred from starting.

- Sores and Ulcers never become chronic
unless the blood is in poor condition âis
sluggish, weak and unable to throw off
the poisons that accumulate in it. The
system must be relieved of the unhealthy
matter through the sore, and great danger
to life -would follow should it heal before

When this has been accomplished the dis- 3 ,
charge gradually ceases, and the sore or
ulcer heals. It is the tendency of these old
indolent sores to grow worse and worse,
and eventually to destroy the bones. Local
applications, Â¦while soothing and to some
extent alleviate pain, cannot reach the seat
of the trouble. S. S. S. does, and no matter
how apparently hopeless your condition,
even though your constitution has broken
down, it will bring relief when nothing
else can. It supplies the rich, pure blood
necessary to heal the sore and nourish
the debilitated, diseased body.

POLICE CHIEF
Mayor-Elect Schmitz to
Meet Commissioners
To-Day.
Mahony's Term on the Beard
Expires Early in Jan
uary, 1902
Mayor-elect Eugene E. Schmitz will
leave his quiet retreat near Watsonville
early this morning and come to San
Francisco on the Monterey express. Short
ly after his arrival in the city he will at-
Tend a conference of the Police Commis
sioners. He *ill return to the country
immediately after the adjournment of the
conference. The subject of a new Chief
of Police is undoubtedly the one that is
to be discussed.
D. I. ilahony's term of office as Police
Commissioner will expire early in Janu
ary next. He was appointed to the
board as the successor of Thomas. The
board, as originally constituted by Mayor
Phelan, consisted of Newhall, Biggy.
Thomas and McXutt. During the conieSi
which terminated in the election of
Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr. to the office
of Chief of Police, Mayor Phelan arbi
Â£2Â£*S removed Commissioner Biggy.
ne Mayors authority to remove a Com
missioner was not challenged in court.
Judge Wallace was appointed to succeed
Â¦Uifigy ana his term 01 office will not ex
111 c until January, 1903. Thomas resigned
irom the commission and the Mayor ap
pointed D. 1. Mahony to till the vacancy.
Mahony's term expires January, iyo2. Dr.
McNutt resigned and the vacancy caused
by his resignation was filled by the
Mayor appointing Josiah K. Howcli,
whose term expires January, 1904. New
hall also holds until 1204.
Captain Win man. acting Chief of Po
lice, will probably serve in executive ca
pacity until the board elects a chief.
There are many indications that Captain
"Wittman will be the board's choice lor
chief.
Mahony May Succeed Himself.
There is talk that Mayor Phelan could
appoint Mahony's successor if he were so
inclined, but the impression is general
that no change in the commission will be
made until Mayor-elect Schmitz is inaug
urated. If the new Mayor adheres
to his public expressions a conserva
tive citizen will be named to succeeeJ
Mahony. Efforts may be made to con
vince the Mayor that Commissioner Ma
hony himself is a shining light of con
servatism.
Good lawyers do not entertain the no
tion that a capricious Mayor can rampse
around and remove a Commissioner at
his pleasure and upset a whole board to
execute some particular design. The
courts may rule that good cause for re
moval must be shown and that not every
thing in the charter is constitutional. In
deed, it will be called to mind that the
courts set aside many of flic provision-*
of the State institution, hence charter
declarations will not be accepted as in
spired doctrine.
Schmitz Will Speak.
Mayor-elect Eugene E. Schmitz has
accepted an invitation to the annual din
ner of the merchants. Doubtless he will
make an after-dinner speech and in some
degree foreshadow the policy of his ad
ministration. Mayors should be ever so
cautious in post-prandial talks. Even
Mayor Phelan. who is generally pretty
well ballasted at banquets, slopped over at
one ast and made a spectacle of him
self that caused the angels to weep.
Auditor Wells announces that he is out
of politics. Yet full of the spirit of -re
form he suggests tha"t the Legislature
shall pass a law to protect candidates
from leg-pullers. It appears that various
organizations having- for sale ball tickets
imposed upon the nominee for Mayor,
The imposition was in the nature of black
mail. Mr. Wells proposes that the can
didate of the future shall not be exposed
to such fr^ud. His position will be sus
tained by successful and unsuccessful can
didates. Indeed, some of the nominees
are willing that a law should be passed
to make the painting of banners a felony
In this new reform the Auditor is almost
sure to receive the support of ex-Assem
blyman Arthur G. Fisk. *

immediate admiration of all lovers of a

Meltzer's play has only shown a few
facets of this actress' many sided talent,

the audience is left with a strong desire
to know what Mrs. Le Moyne would

EXTRA SERVICE
FOR PAY CORPS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.-Paymaster
General Askeny in his annual report rec
ommends that officers of the pay corps
shall be regularly assigned to duty as a
part of the fighting force on shipboard,
and suggests that the pay officer on board
ship should have charge of the powder
division under the ordnance officer, or of
one section of it, when divided, in which
all the personnel of the mess organization
should be stationed at quarters. He says
this would release a line officer on each
ship now assigned to powder duty. It is
said that during the Spanish war this
plan was actually tried, the pay officer
rendering efficient and satisfactory ser
vice in charge of the powder division in
many cases. About seventy pay officers
on hoard ship could be so employed. The
Navigation Bureau has approved the sug
gestion, in view of the shortage of of
ficers. Following this idea further, the
Paymaster General says that In order
that assistant paymasters, upon entering
the service, shall have the requisite
knowledge, the laws should be changed
so that hereafter appointments to the pay
corps would be made from the graduates
of the Naval Academy.
In this connection the Paymaster Gen
eral sneaks of the necessity of a reserve
of pay officers, which in turn would in
volve an increase in the number of pay
masters allowed by law.
Other reforms are proposed: Modifica
tions of the law allowing certified checks
to be issued, instead of bonds, by con
tractors; increased compensation for pay
masters' clerks, and, finally, the need of
more commodious quarters for the Bu
reau of Supplies and Accounts than can
be secured in the Navy Department build

taken by M. I. Alsop, and the rest of the

tains the Central's principal stars, among
them Hallett Thompson, the new leading

Adelman, the xylophone virtuoso, also
produces sweet music. Lillian Burk
hart's new playlet, "The Eighth Year,"
has made an immediate hit and she and
her capable company get several curtain
calls at every performance. The Onllaw
trio, sensational aeriallsts; Burton's com
edy acrobatic dogs; the Lockos, scientific

Congressman Loud Says
Seattle Is Getting

Favors Policy of Selfishness
as City's Hope for.
Prosperity.
Congressman Eugene F. Loud, in an
address delivered last evening before tho
Richmond Improvement Club, declared
that the inauguration of transcontinental
railroad communication in 1869 marked
the commencement of San Francisco's
retrogression, and that Â¦ Seattle, unlesa
prevented by the strenuous efforts of San
Francisco's friends, will soon control the
trade of the Orient as well as that of
Alaska.
It was the regular meeting of the club,
which is one of the most active organiza
tions of its kind in the city. Congress
man Loud has been a good friend to the
Richmond district, and his presence at
the meeting last night was made the oc
casion to extend to him the district's
thanks for past favors.
The Congressman was introduced by
Chairman O. K. Cushing and spoke in
part as follows;
When I addressed this club a year ago I told
you that all I could speak to you about was
what 1 didn't know about improvement clubs.
It ia embarrassing, you know, to a man who
talks only politics to talk about improvements.
Improvement clubs, I see. have been establish
ed all over the city. They have been establish
ed for the benefit of the respective communi
ties.
City's Retrogression.
With the coming of the transcontinental rail
road in 1869 San Francisco's retrograde move
ment began. It continued until IS9B. Up to
1869 San Francisco controlled the trade of the
.entire Pacific Slope. It was the distributing
'point for the entire West. The .incoming of
the transcontinental line and subsequent rail
road development caused the establishment of
distributing points all over this territory. This
all came from San Francisco's championing the
cause of outside places. San Francisco took the
lead in the protest which led to the establish
ment of all these terminal points. We began
with Reno. This was followed with others,
and gradually the railroads took away from
San Francisco all the increased trade.
From 1869 and until IS9S, when the Spanish-
American War began. San Francisco has lived
on the trade of the central and northern parts
of the State. The outbreak of the war brought
San Francisco to the front as the city in the
center of the universe. Men of means began to
look to this port as the place from where the
trade of the Pacific would ultimately be con
trolled. But we can't sit down and just let
all this happen. We must fight for our posi
tion. Let San Francisco become one grand im
provement club. Seattle is now running us a
sharp race. She has secured the Alaska trade
and now bids fair to get the best of the trade
with the Orient. Seattle works for Seattle. Let
us remember that selfishness is the controlling
factor .of success. Humanitarianism is beauti
ful only theoretically. If you have anything
you don't want, let the other fellow have that.
We can compete with the rest of the world only
when we put ourselves on the same plane aa
the rest of the world. I hope to see men of
all classes In this city working together for
the best interests of San Francisco. Seattle
and other places will take care of themselves.
Elected an Honorary Member.
In response to some questions regard
ing the postofflce in the Richmond dis
trict Mr. Loud said the fact that there
was no foreign money order department
there was the result of oversight on the
part of the local authorities. He said the
American postal system was the greatest
in the world.
The club adopted resolutions thanking
Mr. Loud for his past interest in the
Richmond district and asking his services
in the securing of more letter carriers for
that end of town. The club also elected
the Congressman an honorary member
O. X Cushing, George R. Fletcher and
j H. U. Joudin were appointed to represent
! the club at the Chinese Exclusion Con
| vention on November 22. J. M. Wilkins
addressed the meeting and told how a
few words spoken to Congressman Loud
some years ago had resulted in the es
tablishment of a postofflce at the Cliff
House.
"I know it," he said, "for I'm Post
master and I get $100 a year from the
Government for my services."
Beat Horse With Gaspipe.
Frederick Carter, a teamster for the
Overland Freight and Transfer Company,
was arrested yesterday afternoon on a
warrant by Officers McCurrie and Hooper
of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. He is accused on the com
plaint of W. F. Smith, coal dealer of
beating his horse on Grant avenue Tues
day with a piece of gaspipe about three
inches long. When Carter was arrested
he claimed he accidentally struck the
horse.

FILIPINO ASPIRATIONS.
WE get but little idea of the Philippine situa
tion from official reports. These deal truth
fully with official conditions, the state of the
revenues, the cost of civil and military administra
tion, but they give no glimpse of the condition of the
iv . elve m'llions of people on the islands, of their so
cial and industrial state and their civic aspirations.
It is beginning to be apparent that too much has
been expected, immediately, from the presence of
several hundred American teachers among that peo
ple. The work they may do will appear in two or
three gtnerations from now. but for the present will
but slightly change the spirit of the people. In the
fiuet pace, they are a conquered people. As for
learning and letters, they had both when Magellan
visited them, and they were independent. They had
partaker of the East Indian civilization. They had
felt the Vedantic missionary touch before Buddhism
was. So they have a past that is a history of law and
social order among them, preceding the settlement
of this continent by their conquerors. They are now
moving along on the line of an aspiration for au
tcnomy and for a limited self-government. We may
Â»l well realize that our rule, being that of a con
queror, is no more acceptable than that of Spain.
They have adopted one American practice, for
they have held a convention and passed resolutions.
This body sat in Manila, and, as we learn by direct
advices, it represented a constituency of 300,000 mem
bers of the Federal party, from all the islands and
including all the tribes. Senors Tavera and Legarda
of the United States Philippine Commission were
delegates, as were three members of the Supreme
Court. This convention debated the suppression of
the religious communities, the demand for general
amnesty, the return of Filipinos whom we have ex
ied and the erection of a territorial government. It
finally adopted a petition to Congress asking that the
islands be made a Territory of the United States,
with a Governor appointed by the President, with a
Legislature of two houses, the upper one to consist
of thirty members, sixteen of whom shall be elected
by the people and the other fourteen to be appointed
by the Governor. They also demand two delegates
of the islands to the United States Senate. This is a
novelty. Our Territories heretofore have had dele
gates to the House, but we have no doubt that
Hawaii. Oklahoma. New Mexico and Arizona will
join these bright Filipino politicians in demanding
admission by delegate to the Senate also. Indeed,
there is considerable merit in the plan. Strict jus
tice to those people will require that they have in
some form direct representation in our Congress.
Humanity and political expediency require this. The
iate Consul General Wildman early warned our
Government that the Filipinos could not safely be
treated as we have treated our Indians. As we have
made Commissioners and Supreme Court Justices of
them, they have the right to inquire why they may
not have delegate representation in our Congress,
and why should we say "no"? This drama has un
folded and the scroll cannot be rolled up now, but
must be unrolled to the end.
The convention by resolution stated the ravage
and impoverishment caused by our war of conquest
and asked the American Congress to authorize the
issue of $100,000,000 of fifty-year 3 per cent bonds to
put the people on their industrial feet again.
In fact, looking over the character and proceedings
of this representative body an American is compelled
to admit that it compared favorably with any con
vention held during the year anywhere in our do
minions, and in some respects was quite superior to
the constitutional convention of Cuba.
It is a beginning, and further manifestations of
ideas on civil government by those people will be
awaited with interest.
Memphis is to give Admiral Schley a sUver service,
so he will get something out of the court of inquiry
after Â°U that vs. ill be worth looking at.
JUVENILE CRIME.
IN searching for the origin of the criminal ten
dency the penologists are going back to the in
fluences of juvenile life. The theories of Lom
broso and the other believers that there is abnormal
ity in man which is incorrigible are not altogether ac
cepted, since in scores of cases criminals are found
free of the stigmata of degeneracy. When the assas
sin Czolgosz was photographed the tyros in the
school of Lombroso thought they saw in his face the
stamp of degeneracy. But the scientific report upon
him expressly declares that he bore none of the ab
normal stigmata.
Going back to the origin of crime in the early im
pressions of life made in childhood, there is a grow
ing school which believes that a child started on the
lap of a good mother and well and wisely trained,
and protected against evil impressions and contacts
during the years that precede maturity of judgment,
may be considered safe from criminal action, except
in the case of those crimes of passion which are no
proof of criminal instinct.
During the late session of the Congress of Mothers
in Princeton, 111., an address was delivered by Judge
C. J. Neely of the Juvenile Court of Chicago. That
court is organized as a branch of the judicial estab
lishment, which has charge of all matters relating to
juvenile crime and incorrigibility. The fact that in a
great American city a special tribunal is required for
that, purpose emphasizes the importance of it and
gives one an unpleasant realization of the extent to
which crime is rooted in juvenile life in this country.
Judge Neely said that the prevention of crime is of
more importance than its cure. He condemned the
severity of penalties for minor offenses and their
lightness for offenses of greater gravity, and advised a
reformation of the juvenile penal code in that respect.
He found the origin of much crime in juvenile idle
ness and the want of early training. He regards the
kindergarten as a part of the public school system
as a great safeguard, because it introduces those
ideas of form, color and spatial relations which are
the foundation of knowledge of the trades and han
dicrafts. Given this foundation, and all juveniles
who have a bent toward the handicrafts begin early
the mental habit which aids them in the direction of
their natural impulse.
A frightful condition is disclosed by the penal
statistics of the L T nited States. A heavy percentage
of the native American criminals are found to be
under 30, and their criminal career to have begun in
their Of these a very small percentage are
'found to have aay trade or handicraft by which to
earn bread. They are by no means illiterate, but are
found to have a fair common school education. This
last fact is made use of by the opponents of our pub
lic school system, who charge that the germs of
crime are acquired in school. This is not true. The
fault seems to be that when the school training is
acquired there is some foreclosure of opportunity
that blocks the way of American youth into the han
dicrafts and vocations for which their public school
education is a preparation. Idleness at that precise
point in juvenile life is a canker that soon eats away
all the uprightness and virtue inculcated at home and
in school, and its awful consequences appear in the
army of young criminals found in our jails, peniten
tiaries and State schools for the incorrigible. These
serious problems appeared concurrently with the de
cay of the apprenticeship system, and have increased
in gravity as we get further away from it.
As Judge Neely sees benefit in the kindergarten
we incline to the opinion that the start made there
should not be lost, but that with the kindergarten
preceding the primary classes in the public schools
the grammar grade should be supplemented by the
mechanical school. In a completely equipped me
chanical school any trade or handicraft may be
thoroughly learned. The great need of this country
is. and is to be, for skilled workmen. Why is it that
in every branch of American industry men are found
in charge who were born and trained abroad? In
all our metal and smelting works that is the rule.
Going further, the same state of affairs is found
among the workmen. It is fortunate for our indus
tries that we are able to command the services of
these trained men. but it is unfortunate for our insti
tutions that Americans who should fill their due per
centage of these places are morally rotting in prisons
and reform schools.
It is time that the promoters of our public school
system everywhere should appreciate the importance
of this practical form of education. Against it will
arise complaints about the cost. But we affirm that
it costs the taxpayers less to make a self-supporting,
skilled mechanic out of a boy than it does to police
him. stand his depredations upon property, catch
him and either hang him or support him in prison. It
will soon be seen that what we add to the expense of
om schools i**faken out of the cost of administering
our criminal law.
It is announced that the French Minister of Com
merce. If. Millerand, proposes to establish in this
country a French school in which young Frenchmen
can be instructed in American industrial methods. It
would seem, however, to be cheaper and better if the
Minister would send his students to enter at some
American school already established. What is the
use of a French school to teach Americanism?
DOCKING HORSES' TAILS.
FROM the persistency with which fashion holds
to the perverse custom of docking the tails of
horses it is evident the existing laws enacted to
prevent the practice are inadequate for the purpose.
It is said they are ineffective in this State by reason
of the difficulty of proving who docked the tail of any
particular horse, or even that the offense had been
committed in the State. Whatever be the nature of
the defect, it is certainly sufficiently serious to pre
vent the enforcement of the statute, and dock-tailed
horses are as common as they were before the
statute was enacted.
In considering the best means of providing an
effective law it would be well to profit by what has
been accomplished in the way of protecting game by
statute. It is conceded that the game laws not only
of this but of other States have been drawn up so
judiciously that however objectionable they may be
in certain details they are about as effective as
statutes can be. In nearly every important State in
the Union they are enforced so strictly and have so
well stood the test of the courts that game is fairly
well protected. It would seem) then, that if our laws
against the docking of horses' tails were drawn with
the precision of the game laws it would be about as
easy to erforce the cne as the other, and mutilated
horses would be about as rare on our streets as
game in our markets out of season.
One of the most effective provisions of the game
laws is that which forbids any person to have above
a certain amount of game in his possession at any
time, or any of it at all out of season. The restric

State or imported from the outside. A similar pro
vision with respect to dock-tailed horses would
doubtless have an equally good effect. It would be
unfair and inexpedient to forbid any one in California
to keep a horse whose tail is now docked, but a
statute might be enacted which would forbid any one
to own a dock-tailed horse under two years of
age, or at least subject such owner to a heavy fine.
Such a law would have the effect of preventing the
docking of young horses in this State or the inpor
tation of yoang dock-tailed horses from other
States. As the old horses died off there would
be a decrease in the number of dock-tailed horses in
use in fashionable circles, and a consequent diminu
tion of the force of the fashion. Eventually the cus
tom would die out altogether, and the State would
be rid of the pernicious practice.
Fashion is responsible for many forms of folly, but
hardly any is more cruel or more perverse than this.
The tail cf a horse is not only necessary to the com
fort of the animal but is one of his chief beauties.
The docking process not only deprives the horse of
his only means of protecting himself against flies and
other insects, but it also diminishes his attractive
ness in the/ eyes of any one who is genuinely appre
ciative of what a horse should be. It is time to
break up the senseless custom, and to that end the
statutes against it should be made as stringent as
those which protect game.
After all the glowing reports of the electric trains
in Germany that were to run 100 miles an hour, it
appears that all attempts to attain that rate of speed
for any considerable distance have been unsuccessful.
It is not likely that there has been any great loss
to the world by the failure, for very few people would
care to travel at that rate even if they could.
EUROPEAN as well as American students of
economic questions have begun to give atten
tion to the rapidity with which the forests of
the world are being destroyed. Thus the Westminster
Gazette recently noted tha* increasing demands' for
timber in Great Britain and Germany are faced by
decreasing supplies from Norway, Russia and Hun
gary. At present Great Britain is importing wood
of an annual value of Â£22,000,000, while Germany im
ports wood annually to the value of ii 4,000,000.
Europe is unable to meet that demand, and accord
ingly wood is imported from this country, from
Canada, from Australia and elsewhere.
It is not Germany and Great Britain alone that im
port timber. Some of the British colonies are them
selves importers, and the value of their imports
reaches annually the sum of ii 8,000,000. The de
crease in the timber supply is not, however, the
whole question. There is the further evil of cli-
matic changes brought about by denuding the hills of
their forests. The change for the worse is already
noted in many parts of Europe, and countries once
fertile and blessed with a climate suitable for man
and his works are now becoming well nigh uninhabit
itable.
As illustrations of these changes the Westminster
Gazette says: "Bosnia is a country enjoying the
possession of vast forests, and is separated from the
sea by great mountain ranges rising in the Dinaric
Alps to some 6000 feet. Herzegovina, to the south
of Bosnia, has hardly any forests at all. To the west
of Herzegovina, toward the middle of the Adriatic,
is the island of Lissa, a name of ill-omen in the rec
ords of the Italian navy. The summer temperature
of Bosnia is from 4 degrees to 8 degrees Fahrenheit
cooler thai 1 in the mere southerly Herzegovina, and
nearly 2 degrees below that of the sea-girt Lissa. Or,
again, take the shores of the Caspian. On the west
ern coast we have ,1 great forest region. On the
east extend countless acres of desert, sand and stone.
The result is a summer cool and dry at Lenkoran,
but intolerable on the opposite coast of the great in
land sea. Thus results of the most unexpected and
far-reaching nature may be the outcome of the ill
considered deforestation of a country."
At the present time the British Government is
making extensive plantations of forest trees in India
for the double purpose of forming a timber supply
and improving the climate so as to check the pe
riodical droughts that bring famine in their train.
So successful have these plantations been it is be
lieved that in the near future they will constitute one
of the most valuable assets of the Indian Govern
ment. The Australians and the Canadians have
profited by the experience of Europe and they have
adopted measures to nfford something at least of pro
tection to their forest areas.
In this country the waste goes on more rapidly
than anywhere else in the world. In no direction
does the resistless energy of the American people
show itself more potently than in the destruction of
forests. Moreover, in this respect we are nearly as
wasteful as. energetic, and the amount of timber de
stroyed by fire is almost equal to that cut for com
mercial purposes.
In California we have had many a disastrous
warning on this subject. Our annual bill of losses
by forest fires is enormous. The damage done is
far in excess of the cost of adequate protection.
Sooner or later we will learn the lesson which
Europe has learned at such a stupendous cost, and if
we are wise we will learn it before 'we have had to
pay an equal price.
The adoption by Australia of a flag of her own N has
brought about a good deal of a flurry in London,
and particularly among military and naval men. Ad
miral de Horsey, for example, says: "The ancient
British flag is good enough for the whole empire.
Why should Australia adopt a flag, which, however
artistic, must rank second to that of the empire and
which no foreign warships visiting Australia could
ever properly salute?" Such are the questions that
are troubling the British, but up to this time we have
not heard of their troubling the Australians.
Richard Croker, in commenting upon the recent
New York election, seems to have made a curious
blunder. He said that it rained and defeat came to
him, as he is not a mud horse. Everybody else in
America believed that Mr. Croker's natural element
was mudâ social, political and moral.
Thus far this year John D. Rockefeller has drawn
$19,200,000 in dividends from the Standard Oil Com
pany. It is to be hoped, for the general belief which
entertained of the goodness of human nature, that
Mr. Rockefeller thinks he earned his salary.
As a result of the elections it appears the Demo
crats will gain a Senator in Maryland and another
in Kentucky, but that will make no difference to the
country. The majority in the Senate is all right.
Sir Thomas Lipton intends to name his next chal
lenger Shamrock Third. Is it possible that he has
forgotten that there can be only two yachts in the
race and that his boat will be ridiculously misnamed?

THE WASTE OP FORESTS.
CARTHUSIAN MONKS ARE BANISHED
FROM THEIR 1000-YEAR-OLD HOME
MONASTERY IN FRANCE IN "WHICH FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE CARTHUSIAN MONKS HAVE LIVED,
AND WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ABANDON BECAUSE OF THE RECENT ENACTMENT OF
WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE "ASSOCIATIONS LAW."
THE monastery of La Grande Chartreuse, in the Isere
Department of France, after nearly 1000 years of benefi
cent activity, has just been deserted by the Carthusian
monks, and the world's supply of the rich liqueur which
bears their name has been stopped at its source. The new
"associations law" of France has driven the friars out of the
country and the republic incidentally loses one of her largest
sources of revenue. The Order of the Carthusians was founded
by the holy St. Bruno in 1081 and the first monastery was built
on the site occupied by the present one. The latter buildings

FIVE MEN HAVE
NARROW ESCAPE
Collapse of Batteries
Causes Several Ex
plosions.
San Francisco Electric Com
pany Suffers Loss of
$50,000.
A series of explosions, accompanied by
lightning flashes in the battery-room of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany on Stevenson street, opposite the
Spreckels Market, startled the entire
lower part of the city at 10:45 o'clock last
night. To the few persons who were in
the vicinity at the time it seemed as if
the entire building was destined to be de
stroyed. The structure was not greatly
damaged, but the damage to the storage
cells of the company will reach about
$50,000.
The explosions were due to the collapse
of a mezzanine floor upon which a bank
uf batteries, containing fifty-live cells,
constructed oÂ£ heavy structural iron, had
been placed in readiness for the holiday
flecmc service of the company. It was
this bank of batteries which feeds the 110
volt system for incandescent lights used
in he residence districts. When the bank
collapsed the lights in numerous resi
dences were extinguished and these pa
trona can now be supplied only from the
main batteries of the company.
The work of constructing the bank be
gan some three months ago and in that
time many meg were employed and a vast
amount ot material used. These batteries
were made up of cells filled with many
gallons of sulphuric acid and heavy zinc
slabs. The combined weight of the bat
teries upon the mezzanine floor was enor
mous and proved to be too much for the
structure. When the collapse came the
upper batteries were precipitated upon
ihe lower and explosion after explosion
followed. The accident necessarily caused
a short circuit across the buss-bars and
when the electric fluid came in contact
with the acid instant ignition ensued.
Kwry contact of the circuit with the
chemical produced a lightning flash of
wonderful brilliancy, accompanied by a
pyrotechnic display of sparks. The sparks
came from th<_ upper windows of the
building In clouds and it was this which
inspired the belief that the building would
be dashed into fragments to the immi
nent danger of surrounding property.
At the time of the accident five men
were at wark about the batteries. Thtse
were A. Adams, foreman. D. Heading
W. L. Wemmer. J. F. Earll and E. Staf
ford. Adams states that his attention
was first attracted to the mezzanin"
floor, which appeared to sink. Suddenly
there came a crash and explosion. Ho
shouted to the men to run for their lives,
and following his example all escaped
into Stevenson street in safety. An
alarm of fire was immediately turned in,
and in five minutes two engines were on
the scene. The firemen had scarcely
opened one of the doors when another
explosion took place. There was a stam
pede of spectators, but the firemen brave
ly stuck to thtir posts until all danger
of further explosions was past. Some ot
the woodwork in the building took fire.
but it was extinguished without diffi
culty.
The scene presented within the build
ing after the electric circuit was cut off
was one of supreme desolation. The
cells w<-re piled upon one another in great
confusion and many pans of tht. struc
tural iron work were melted and twisted

WOOD RATTLES
OFF TESTIMONY
Nome Contempt Cases
Are Nearing Their
Completion.
Taking of Evidence Will Be
Finished by End of
the Week.
Joseph K. Wood, who played the part
of District Attorney in Nome when Mc-
Kenzie and Noyes flourished, stepped into
the shoes of the leading man yesterday
afternoon. The attorneys finished with
Judge Noyes and, save for a few ques
tions asked Attorneys Metson and John
son, Wood was the star of the day's pro
ceedings.
As he is one of the respondents held lor
contempt and is without an attorney he
conducted his own examination. When
Wood filed his answer he pleaded guilty
to the charges of contempt, but begged
for the court's leniency and mercy.
Wood put himself on the stand and
without warning rattled off his story tor
more than two long hours. During the
last four weeks he has been skulking
about, sitting quietly in corners, pulling
his mustache with fierce vigor and wrink
ling his brow into heavy lines, all the
time charging himself for the effort en
the stand. He has unloaded. The center
of his target was tkame, every one of
whose allegations were emphatically de
nied. Wood adorned his denunciation of
Hume with many homely similes used to
express the Nome attorney's material
worth.
The testimony taking is now near the
end. At 11 o'clock the Circuit Court of
Appeals heard from the attorneys state
ments as to progress made. Both .sides
agreed that they would be ready for the
hearing on Monday morning, at which
time the court ordered the attorneys to
present their case.
Patches Sewed in Case.
The morning session began with a cross
examination of the witness on the peti
tion sent by the attorneys of Nome to
Washington begging for Judge Noyes' re
moval. In the course of this line of ques
tions the date of the opposition to Noyes
was brought up. The witness said the
opposition began when a certain news
paper published an article against him
for removing one of its friends who had
been a commissioner in the Kugarok, and
when the petition of attorneys was wired
to the President. Pillsbury went througn
the list of attorneys who signed the pe
tition and tried to get an admission from
the witness that four-fifths of the legal
business in Nome was conducted by thoae
men who signed the petition.
On another switch Pillsbury asked: "Did
you meet a man by the name of Ham
burger, the private secretary of Senator
Carter in Nome?"
"I have no recollection of it," responded
the Â¦?ritness.
The impaneling of juries came up for
a reconsideration. Pillsbury wanted to
know if the Grand Jury panels were not
exhausted by discharges on the part of
Judge Noyes.
The cross-examination of Judge Noyes
concluded rather abruptly, and the re
direct examination was begun. Old mat
ter was thrashed over, and then Judge
McLaughlin dismissed the witness for all
time. Judge Johnson took the stand at
the call of respondents' attorneys to tes
tify on matters of Alaska law concerning
the taking of depositions. William H.
Metson followed on the stand, and was
asked but a few questions in regard to
the Lane interests, which he represented.
Metson gave way for the witness of the
day.
Wood Eattles Away.
"My appointment as District Attorney,"
said Wood, was due entirely to Senator
Carter and myself. I say at this time
Mr. McKenzie had nothing to do with
my appointment. I never met Mr. Mc-
Kenzie until two or three days after my
appointment. I knew of him by reputa
tion since 1885. Mr. McKenzie, however,
knew my fatr^r and mother before I was
born. Our relations were always pleas
ant. He has never asked me to do any
thing which would involve me in trouble.
His onlr advice was to keep my office
clean and clear. Attorney General Griggs
refused to appoint me as District Judge.
Senator Carter, who was working for me,
said:
â¢ Mr. Wood, in reference to the part I
took in the alien legislation, people would
say that I expected to secure through the
bench that which I could not obtain
through legislation.' "
The witness denied all dependence upon
McKenzie for transportation or for hotel
expenses from St. Paul to Alaska. Con
tinuing,'the witness said: "Mr. McKenzie
never paid a cent of my hotel bIJIs in his
life, barring the fact that he bought me a
few $5 dinners when I met him and I
wanted to eat. Mr. McKenzie never so
licited me to appoint Mr. Hume as deputy
district attorney."
Then the witness told of the partnership
cifereement. which was to give Wood one
quarter interest in the firm of Hubbard,
Beeman & Hume and McKenz'e another
fourth.
"At the first conversation," said the wit
ness, "it was agreed that Hume should be
deputy. At the second interview the
terms and conditions of the partnership
were discussed. There was absolutely no
suit of action mentioned. Papers of part
nership were drawn up, but I don't think
the contract was ever signed. The express
understanding was that the contract was
not consummated, though it was drawn
up."
Further on Wood said:
"I learned from either Chips or Hubbard
that McKenzie was going to be appointed
receiver, and then I told McKenzie that
it was all off with the partnership, as I
did not,care to be in a firm where attor
neys were interested in a case and one of
them in a receivership."
When the witness hit upon the name of
Hume in earnest he carried him up and
down the ladder of falsehood and iniquity.
Hume, according to Wood, is a very bad
man. indeed, and was guilty of many acts
unbecoming a true gentleman of the Arc
tic Brotherhood. Wood's story ended with
Hume. Wood said:
"Two days after I appointed Hume dep
uty 1 became dissatisfied, for he suggested
having all the people on Anvil Creek ar
rested for robbing a mining claim. I said
to him I would not permit it, because It
was using criminal process to civil ends."
The witness' explanation in regard to
the keys which he refused to deliver was
rather ingenious. When asked for the
keys he said. "I'll see about it." Wood
claims he meant that he was going to see
McKenzie ar.d ask him about it.
Son Causes His Mother's Arrest.
Lena Molter. an elderly German woman,
was booked at the City Hall police station
yesterday on the charge of carrying a
concealed deadly weapon. Mrs. Molter
and her son, whoeonductaa carriage trim
ming shop at 1112 Mission street, do not
agree and as a consequence he telephoned
to police headquarters for an officer, say
ing that his mother had a pistol in her
rooms over the shop and he feared she
would shoot him. Officer C. W. Laws was
sent to the prace and on finding the
woman armed with a six-shooter he took
her to the station and locked her up. The
woman claims that her son has- abused
her shamefully while her husband has
been absent, confined in the Napa Insane
Hospital. She feared greater violence at
his hands and in order to protect herself
against him she placed a pistol in her
pocket. Both sides will be heard in the
Police Court to-day.
Rescues Half-Starved Horses.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
seized some half-starved horses on the
water front yesterday which were owned
by George Switzer and were in transit to
Petaluma to be killed and used for
chicken feed. The society officials stajte
that Switzer will be arrested when he can
be fcund.

DIMMICK GUILTY
ON TWO COUNTS
Convicted of Failing to
Deposit Funds
Properly.
Jury Recommends Disgraced
Official to Mercy of
the Court.
The jury in the case of the United
States vs. Walter N. Dimmick, ex-chief
clerk of the United States Mint, came
Into court at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon, after three hours and a half of de
liberation, and returned a verdict of
guilty on the seventeenth, nineteenth and
twentieth counts of the indictment. Th^se
counts charge Dimmick with having
failed to deposit in the sub-treasury, in
accordance with the regulations, money
of the Government received by him from
the Selby Smelting and Lead Works for
bluestone and other by-products of the
Mint. The jury recommended the pris
oner to the mercy of the court. Judge
de Haven set Monday as the time lor
pronouncing sentence.
S. C. Denson concluded the closing ar
gument for the Government shortly after
noon, and Judge de Haven read the
charge to the jury, which retired at 12:3(3.
At a quarter of 1 o'clock they were taken
to lunc,h and returned to court at 2 for
the purpose of receiving further instruc
tions on the last counts of the indict
ment.
Dimmick is already under sentence of
two years' Imprisonment in the peniten
tiary at San Quentin for embezzling (1333
from the Mint, a case parallel to tho
present one. In that case George D. Col
lins, his attorney, has taken an ' appeal
to the United States Circuit Court. The
Federal Grand Juxy, which will be im
paneled probably next week, will be called
upon by the United States District At
torney to rind H bill of indictment against
Dimmick for the larceny of $30,000 from
the Mint. United States Attorney Wood
worth and the special counsel for the
Government. Denson & Schlesinger, say
that they have as, good a case against the
prisoner as the two cases on which they
have secured convictions.
SUNSET LIMITED RESUMES.
Overland Trains on the Coast Line.
Commencing on December 6 the famous
"Sunset limited" train will make tri
weekly trips, with equipment and serv
ice unsurpassed.
No effort will be spared to keep this
train fully up to the high standard at
tained in past seasons.
The route via New Orleans steadily in
creases in popularity with the traveling
public, and the growth of the oil, rice and
other industries in that section adds ad
ditional interest to this winter transconti
nental trip.
On same date overland train service
will be inaugurated on the Coast Line via
Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa
Barbara, and this route will be followed
by the "Sunset Limited" in its flight to
New Orleans and New York.
Mrs. Biter in Court.
The hearing of the Biter case occupied
the attention of Judge CofCey again yes
terday. Mrs. Biter testified in her own
behalf and a Mrs. Chambers, who knows
the woman who is caring for the Allen
children, testified that she had known
Mrs. Biter for fifteen years and always
regarded her highly.

Metal Trades Association
Supports Fulton Iron
Works.
Notwithstanding the claims made by
the leaders of the iron workers' strike
that the Fulton Iron Works had capitu
lated to its striking employes when 500
' men returned to work on Monday, the
! contrary appears to be the case. The men
| found an easy way of getting out of the
' difficulty that confronted them and ac
! cepted the "winter schedule" of the Ful
ton Iron Works. Some went back la
work at less wages than they had re
ceived before May 20, and same whose
services were deemed more valuable re
ceived an increase of 2^ cents per hour.
When the strike was commenced on May
20 last the demand was made for tea
hours' pay for nine hours' work, with an
increase of 12Vi per cent on the then pro
vailing rate of wages. Early in the strike
it was found that the latter demand
j would not be conceded under any circum-
I stances and the light since then has been
j concentrated on me proposition of ten
1 hourd' pay for nine hours' work. The
fact that the Fulton Iron Work 3 has se
cured all the men that it could handle
without regard to this latter limitation
stems to settle the question as to the Ul
timate ending of tne matter as far as tne
i otner iron working estaulisnmenta are
| concerned. Desertions from tne Â«ranKs of

in order to set at rest the question as
to wneiher the Fulton iron works nad
violateu its agreement with the Meta.l
Traues Association by engaging its Old
employes under any other conditions than
tnose existing beiore tne sirine, a special
meeting of tne Metal Trades Association
was neid yesterday, at wnich some sev
enty linns were represented. The meet
ing was held behina closed doors, but the
results obtained are well known in iron
trades circles.
President Spiers and Secretary Heyne
man of the Fulton Iron Works were
called before the meeting and closely in
terrogated by Henry T. Scott, the chair
man of the meeting, and many of the
members present, humors of all kinds
were investigated and every material
point that could bear upon the matter of
settlement was gone into thoroughly. The
result was the complete vindication of
the management of the Fulton Iron
Works of any breach of trust as far as
its relations to the Metal Trades Associa
tion was concerned. A resolution uphold
ing the management of the Fulton Iron
Works and declaring that no concessions
had been granted was unanimously
adopted.
Messrs. Spiers and Heynemann stated
| that the men resumed work under the
i winter schedule and strictly in accordance
with the rules passed by the Metal
Trades Association; that none of the de
mands of the men had been granted, al
though a few of the leading men had
: been Klven an increase of 2U cents Der
hour, based simply on the ability of these
few men. They did not agree to take all
the men back, nor would they agree to
that condition. They stated that les3
than 20 per cent of the old hands return
ing had received the increase of pay

On the contrary, they hired two non-union

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Silver lower again. Exchange about the same.
Wheat dull and easy. Barley weak and inactive.
Oats and Corn inactive and freely offered.
Hax and Feedstuff s sktno no further change.
Butter still shading off under excessive stocks.
Cheese and Eggs firmly held, but no higher.
Xo further change in Dried Emits.
Provisions weak here and firmer at Chicago.
Meat Market as before quoted.
Poultry and Game in good demand.
Oranges and Lemons weaker. Grapes neglected.
Potatoes continue to advance. Onions firm.
Fair trading in local stocks and bonds.
Pried Fruit in New York:
Mail reports from New York say: "The
market shows fair activity on the whole. Cur
rants are very firm at 5%c for Amalias and
the tendency appears to be toward a slightly
higher quotation. Inquiries fcr round lots at
Vfec under the market are here from the West,
end offers of i 6 -sc for ordinary Amalias and
6%e for wedding cakes were turned down yes
terday. BKflft%e being asked, firm. The Guild
hall, which was reported at St. Michaels No
vember 3, is expected to arrive next Wednes
day, but only a very few barrels of currants
are offering trom her at i\c. A large portion
of her canro, it is believed, has been 60ld to
cleaners.
Â¦Persian dates are held firm at Wednesday's
decline to 3^c for Hallowi, 3c for Khadrawi
and 2%c for Sair. An active trade is reported
at the new range. A bid of 3%c for a round
lot of Hallowi is reported to have been turned
c wr. Figs are firm and selling very well,
mostly from 7%@11%c.
"Prunes are easier on the spot for all ex
cept the email sizes. Outside prices are now
Â¦ >r 40-50R, 6^c for 60-60S, s\c for 60-70s,
We for WHi and 4\c for SO-90e. Small sizes
are in comparatively light supply and are un
changed The news from California that the
courts have finally knocked out the Cured Fruit
Association by a decision which will prevent
the combine from compelling growers to deliver
prunes to it is without effect here and ex
cites almost no interest, as it has been for
f n ra? time known that the association was
practically dead so far as the new crop is
concerned. Santa Claras, 1901 crop, are still
offered on a 2%c basis; Sonomas and Visalias
en c basis.
estie raisins are easier locally. New
â¢vn loose Muscatels are offered at 5%c.
but probably %c less would buy without much
trouble. New seeded in cartons are generally
quoted at 7%c. old from about 717 1 i l @7%c. Apri
cots and peaches are steady but quiet."
The Hay Market.
A local authority says of hay: "Receipts
â¢ week were 4740 tons. Receipts for the
corresponding week last year were but 2510
These unusually heavy receipts are due
to a determined effort upon the part of both
the farmers and the railroad company to move
hay lying in the field and exposed to the
Â¦u father. Boxcars are practically as scarce as
at last writing, but the railroad company has
relieved the lamine on the coast division by
the addition of many new flats. The heavy
receipts o: the past week are largely due to
increased shipments from San Benito County.
It will not require much more time to market
hay in the fields, which cannot be stored in
the warehouses owing to lack of capacity, and
in our judgment the semi-annual stock taking
of the Hay Association will furnish a surprise
tc many, as it will probably be considerably
lighter than usual at this time of year. At
present the market is decidedly dull and prices
are from 50c to $1 a ton lower for the better
gradts of hay than they were at the time of
our last repyrt. If receipts are to continue
heavy the market will no doubt remain dull
and weak, but we doubt very much if they
will. We have a great deal of confidence in
th* future of the market, although we do not
anticipate any very material advance in prices.
<i continues in light supply and will no
doubt be scarce during the balance of the
season. Compressed hay is in much better de
mand than it wag and has advanced accord
ingly. Straw continues scarce. We quote
choice wheat hay at $11(311 50. Something very
fancy will probably bring $12, but such offer
ings are the exce; I
The Current Prosperity.
A New York financial authority says of the
current wave of prosperity and the prospects
for its continuance:
"While conditions are less favorable than
* year ago and there are weak points that will
bear watching yet the situation at the moment
seems more favorable to an upward than a
downward movement. Stocks are still highly
concentrated in strong hands and holders are
Eot willing sellers at the present level. No
doubt the strongest incentive to operations for
higher prices is the prevalence of general pros
perity. From nearly all sections of the coun
try come reports of continued good business
conditions. Even in the drought-stricken dis
tricts business is better than expected owing
to other offsets, and no complaints are forth
coming Bank clearings are phenomenally
Heavy, having for several weeks exceeded last
year s heavy totals by 15 to M per cent and
over. Railroads are often overburdened with
traffic, and earnings continue to show gains of
10^ lo per cent over the handsome gains of
last year. On almost every side there are the
most positive evidences of great industrial ac
tivity, and as yet there are no important signs
of cessation. Good judges expect the boom
in iron to continue for some months to come
and any recession from present high and profit
able prices would simply bring in a new lot
of orders that would keep both new and old
capacity fully employed. The woolen goods
trade, which is rarely what iF called prosper
ous, is in better condition to-day than for a
long period, and so the list could be extended
In c few cases there are indications of producl
tlon overtaking consumption, but these are ex
ceptional. Prices in general are very high
Â«nd as in the case of iron slieht recessions
will quickly revive any abatement in demand
Dun s Index figure is now at 57.7 which is
about the highest of the last ten ' years It
le remarkable but true that this high level of
prices is entirely due to the failure of produc
tion to keep pace with consumption. Specu
lation has had very little to do thus far with
advancing prices, and it is questionable 'if we
have ever witnessed such a wide and continu
ous upward movement in value? relatively free
ulation as has been experienced during
the last five or six \ears. The question is
will the present wave of prosperity culminate
in a speculative -outbreak, or will it recede iri
a quiet and orderly fashion? The latter course
is to he desired, but it will be aeainst all
previous experience if we escape dangerous
speculative excesses."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.-The stock market to
day after a rather irregular and ragged open
ing started up with a rise and some enthu
siasm, but the heavy cold exports dashed the
spirits of the speculators and drove prices
down. The selling was not urgent or precipi
tate and there was a manifest growth of dull
ness at the decjine and an undertone of some
firmness. The market during the greater part
of the day was feverish and Irregular, but
dipped suddenly at the last and a number of
important stocks closed at the lowest of the
day. There was a marked contrast in the tone
of Union Pacific and St. Paul, the former
offering resistance to the declines and the lat
ter runnins off easily to the lowest of the
day. This apparently reflected a dubious state
of mind as to the exact benefit which would
accrue to St. Paul from the Northern Pacific
settlement. ! , ,
The stock was a leader in the early upward
movement on reports that it would be absorbed
by the Union Pacific as an incident of the
great railroad settlement. The pendency of
this settlement and the very optimistic re
ports in certain Quarters as to the condition of
the anthracite coal trade were inspiring causes
of the animated advance in prices early in
the day. The engagements of gold for to-mor
row at one time aggregated- $5,500,000, but the
cancellation of a $1,000,000- order lightened the
shipment and also the resulting depression in
the market. The cause of the cancellation was
not stated, but may have had to do with the
customary limitation of gold shipments by a
single vessel. A notable feature of the gold
shipments was its failure to affect the foreign
exchange market. When cold is shipped It is
customary to sell exchange bills against the
shipments, but there was no sign of any such
bills in the market to-day. This corrobrates
the supposition that the shipment is made in
payment of debts which had been incurred by
short selling of exchange bills earlier in the
season and which there Is not sufficient cur
rent Euo?ly of commercial bills offering to
cover. The effect of the gold shipments was
emphasized by their leaving the exchange
market still at the export level, developing
ground for the apprehension that additional
shipments will go on Saturday.
Incorporation of the Northern Securities
Company and the decision to retire the North
ern Pacific preferred stock were known before
the close, but did not meet with any marked
response.
Four per cent was the minimum rate In the
call market. The market â¢ closed generally
easy and active.
The bond market was less active. Total
sales, par value, $5,252,000. United States 3s

London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was becalmed but
cheerful. Among the factors that contributed
to the better feeling was the rumor that the
German Emperor was endeavoring to persuade
the Boers to surrender and also the news that
refugees were returning and the mines were
reopening. There was also a canard that
Botha, with 800 men, had surrendered. Amer
ican stocks moved in narrow limits. The au
thorities expect a sag in prices because of the
complete absence of the public from the mar
ket. New York bought Canadian Pacific only.
Money is very scarce, the rate ranging from
1 to 4 per cent. The bank again borrowed on
consols and the market borrowed Â£1,000,000
from the bank.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 13.â A strong cash corn sit
uation led to bull activity and helped along
grain. Corn opened steady in spite of weaker
cablrg. The early business was quiet and pit
traders sold, easing prices a trifle. Reports
soon began to arrive, however, showing a re
markable cash strength. Sales were being
made to the East, West and South, in addition
to rood quantities taken for export. Sales on
track in Kansas City were reported at from
%@l%c higher than the local December quo
tation and prices here naturally shot upward.
Bulls began loading up again, shorts ran to
cover and December ran up to a srt-ong close,
I%*I'V4C above December.
The wheat market was a steady affair, but
actively steady when numerous bearish con
ditions are considered. Cables were weaker,
though only moderately bo. Both primary and
Northwestern receipts were heavy. The crowd
showed no inclination to buy at the early
steady hour, though offerings were liberal.
This brought an easy feeling and a stream of
liquidations. About this time the strength in
corn began to develop and wheat traders took
everything offered. Prices, however, never
went higher and December closed at 71%@71%c,
closing steady at 71% c. Trade on the whole
was only fairly active, the bulk of the business
beinr done. early.
Oats wore moderately active and strong.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The depression In Butter continues and quo
tations are oft again. The market is too heav
ily suppled.
Cheese is steady. There is plenty here, but
no glut, and sellers are holding firmly up to
full quotations.
The advance in Eggs seems to be checked
for the moment. Buyers are not so eager, and
offerings, while not large, are not as meager
as for the past three or four days. The market
shows no weakness, however.
Receipts were 18,300 pounds of Butter,
pounds of Eastern Butter, 426 cases of Eggs,
cases of Eastern Eggs, 8400 pounds of Cali

Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of berries were heavier and prices
were lower. Large Strawberries were espe
cially weak, as they came in late, and most of
them had to go to the canners.
' Grapes were very weak. The demand has
fallen off considerably, and even the large
boxes, which have been favored by the local
trade, are accumulating.
Oranges continue to weaken, and $3 25 is now
about the top for the best Navels. There is
no change in Limes, but Lemons are easier.

A circular for Australia says: "Since October
21 the following coal cargoes from Newcastle,
N. S. W., have been delivered here, viz.: Here
ford, 2084 tons; Hinemoa, 3486 tons; Orontes,
1813 tons; Marlon Frazer, 3600 tons: Bracadale,
3047 tons; Clack man Ire, 2345 tons; Edmoud
Rostand. ' 2970 tons; total. 29,345 tons.
There are now on the engaged list to deliver
coal here from Newcastle, thirty-five vessels,
with a carrying capacity of nearly 100,000 tons;
this Is an increase of fully 20,000 tons in the
past - thirty days. Some of these vessels will
not arrive here before March or April next.
The latest freight rates on coal from Australia
are quoted at 12 shillings per ton. and even at
this low figure Importers are making very light
profits on their present asking prices. They
are forced to name low figures, as they come
in direct competition with British Columbia
grades. Fuel Oil Is making new converts daily,
and is causing coal consumers to adopt Its use,
and a number who were skeptical about mak
ing any change are now modifying their ma
chinery. The disasters to the- Wellington col
lieries will cause a lively demand for such Aus
tralian fuel as Is suitable for domestic pur
poses, but it must arrive here within the next
ninety days; after -that time the winter de
mand diminishes. The decline in outward grain
freights should cause an advance in coal
freights from the Colonies." .

STOCK MARKET.
The decline in Giant Powder was arrested
on the morning session by strong parties, who
turned in and absorbed all offerings. Under
their purchases it advanced from $73 50 to $83.
closing the call firm. Market Street Railroad
was weak at $S2 75@53. The unsettled condi
tion of this stock, which is a source of mys
tification to many, is said to be due to more
or less uncertainty among a good many people
as to the purchase of the foldings of the small
owners by the syndicate which has bought the
system. The other stocks showed no changes
worthy of note and the oil stocks continued
dull and featureless.
Giant Powder continued to improve in the
afternoon, rising to $84 50. Paauhau Sugar was
weaker at ?12 50.

Capture Military Force
of Taboga Island by
Clever Work.
Use Steamer Taken From
Government to Worry
Sailing Vessels.
COLON. Colombia, Thursday, Nov. 7.â
Following are the details of the capture
by insurgents of the steamer Darien,
which was recently purchased by the
Government from the Darien Gold Min
ing Company at Panama:
, The Darien was dispatched by the Co-
; -mbian Government, toward the end of
October, to convey a rapid-fire gun and a
lair supply of rifles and ammunition to
the forces now stationed at Aguadulce.
It is rumored that she had on board 55000
to be delivered at Aguadulce. The steam
er had been ordered to keep well in sight
of Chorrera, the headquarters of the in
surgent forces, on her way to Aguadulce.
In compliance with this order it appears
the captain of the Darien steamed too
close to land wnen in the vicinity of
Chorrera ana the streamer grounded on
a. sand Dank in signt of the rebel forces,
who soon surrounded her with canoes,
open boats, etc, and took possession
without any righting whatever.
The rebels, on the rise of the tide, im
mediately ordered the captain to steam
to the island of Taboga, about ten miles
south of Panama, anu on arriving there
they signaled to the officer commanding
the military contingent there to come on
board. As soon as ne did so he was made
Â« prisoner and compelled to write an or
der for the force under his command to
embark with all haste with their arms.
In this manner about thirty men and all
the arms and ammunition at Taboga were.
captured. '
It is said the Government believes that
the captain of the Darien was in the pay
of the rebels.
The Darien has since been trying to
capture sailing vessels having Govern
ment troops on board and actually had
one in tow when she- was chased - by a
email steamer chartered from the canal
company. The Government is now with
xut any steamers or gunboats of its own
it t Panama. ,

GRAPE-NTJTS.
POOR CHRISTIANS.
Unwise Feeding Makes Them.
Borne people thought he was a funny old
mar. when he spoke at camp meeting: on
the subject of "Lord. Give Us Sense."
One of the first requisites for living a
peaceful, upright, honest and religious life
ie food of the kind that ran be easily
digested and that furnishes the rebuilding
material for good, healthy brain and
nerve centers.
It is absolutely out of the question for a
person to be peaceful, capable and right
minded when the brain is underfed, and
the nerves wrecked from lack of rebuild-
ing elements they have a right to expect
from good food.
A person fed on meat, bacon, ham. fried
cakes, hot biscuits, sticky and poorly
cooked starchy oatmeal and wheat, may
possibly have strong digestion enough to
handle these things and be a happy,
healthy individual; but 90 people in 100
have not. and the result is irritable, poor-
. ly nourished, nervous bodies, foul breath,
r* and a general condition that prevents one
fiom being happy and contented. It is
practically impossible for such persona
to be good Christians. -J *
The religion of common "sense and good
food Is the first religion that a man or
woman should cultivate, for that condi-
tion makes possible thoughts of a higher
nature and a better grade.
There is a world of wisdom In the say-
ing of Ruskin, "We may be sure we are
not serving the Lord if we are not happy
ourselves." All should try to build up a
steady set of nerves and get rid of dys-
pepsia, constipation, fluttering heart,
weak, nervous conditions, and a train of
terrors that come from bad digestion and
poor food. They should quit coffee abso-
lutely. Take for breakfast a little cooked
or raw fruit, a saucer of Grape-Nuts
Food and a cup of Postum Coffee. No
meat or grease. You will have a clean,
healthy stomach for dinner,, and at that
meal have some meat and vegetables that
you can digest. Let your supper be the
same as your breakfast.
Tou probably don't need medicine, but
you need the kind of food that contains
elements that rebuild the soft gray mat-
-(|^r in the brain and nerve centers
Throughout the body.
It is "Up to you," reader, to put your-
self right and make of yourself a happy,
cheerful individual, capable, and show-
Ing forth the charm of life rather than
It* terrors and distresses.
TRYING TO WEAR
OUT THE BOERS
British War Secretary
Says England Has
Set Her Teeth.
Will Provide Lord Kitchener
With Fresh Troops to
Continue Fight.
LONDON, Nov. 13.â Mr. Brodrick, the
British War Secretary, speaking to-night
at a banquet given in London in his
honor by the City Carlton Club, declared
that the Boers are hiding their tracks
by murdering the Kaffirs behind them.
Lord Kitchener wired to-day, he con
tinued, that the cold-blooded murder of
natives had become frequent of late, and
that two dead natives, their hands tied
behind their backs, were found Novem
ber U at the bottom of a mine shaft.
Later in hi? speech Brodrick said Great
Britain has now 42,000 Boers in custody in
the centralization camps and on various
islands, and that 11,000 more had been
killed or wounded or had left the country
on parole- He added that he believed the
number of Boers now in the Held was
about iO.OOO.
"The country has set Us teeth and in
tends to go through the process of wear
ing them down," he exclaimed. "We in
tend to provide Lord Kitchener with
fresh troops to replace the tired ones.
Only to-day a certain colony made an
offer to help.''
Brodrick said he was sorry anything
had happened to affect the career of Sir
Redvers Buller, and he assured the com
pany that' the deafness of Sir Evelyn
Wood was not a bar to the work that
officer had to do as commander of an
army corps.
BERLIN, Nov. 13â The Frankfurter
Zeitung to-day publishes an interview
with A. D. Wolmarens, the Boer repre
sentative, now at Amsterdam, in which
the latter is quoted as declaring that the
alleged impending peace negotiations be
tween the Boers and British are un
founded.
"So long." said Wolmarens, "as the
British Ministry maintains the attitude
outlined by Chamberlain's and Lord Salis
bury's last speeches, the question of
peace cannot be entertained. The idea of
the cession of the gold fields Is absurd."
JAPAN FAILS TO SELL
HER BONDS IN AMERICA
Mikado's Representatives in This
Country Report the Collapse of
the Project.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 13.â The Japan
Herald says the scheme of the Japanese
Government for the acquisition of money
from abroad by undertaking the sale of
public bonds on the American market has
finally ended in a fiasco. As is well
known, the Government has been at
tempting the introduction of foreign capi
tal, with a view of undertaking such pub
lic works as are necessary, and it is a
fact that for a time the negotiations with
American capitalists made a favorable
passage, but subsequent to the death of
Mr. McKinley the market condition for
the sale of Japanese bonds became dis
couraging. Marquis Ito, who is now in
America, did his best on behalf of the
Japanese Government, but, having exact
ing conditions alleged to have been de
manded by foreign capitalists, he has be
come compelled to recognize the failure
of his exertions, and Mr. Takahiri, Japa
nese Minister in Washington^ has like
wise dispatched a telegram to his home
government announcing the total collapse
of the expected acquisition of foreign cap
ital.
In view of the hopelessness on the part
of the Government to resume its attempt
on advantageous terms, the authorities
have made up their minds to map out an
other financial programme, but as to the
nature of the fresh scheme nothing has
yet come to light.
Work for Stanford Debaters.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 13.â
The Stanford lntersociety Debating
League has taken action that may result
in the cardinal's debating interests being
extended beyond their present narrow
limits. Negotiations are being made with
the University of Washington with the
view of obtaining an oratorical contest
between the northern team and the Stan
ford second team. The cardinal first team
i^ scheduled for a debate with represent
atives from the University of Nebraska,
but it seems improbable now that the
Nebraskans will come to Stanford. Colo
rado College, located in Colorado Springs,
has sent out a challenge for a debate, and
it is possible that arrangements will be
made for such a contest. The prelimin
aries for the Carnot debate will occur on
Friday and Saturday evenings of this
week, thirty-two candidates being en
tered in the contest.

Dawson a Railway Center.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 13.â The Colo
nist says editorially this morning: "We
have information which leads us to feel
warranted in Haying that the proposed
railway from Dawson to the Klondike
mines will be built next summer. The line
will probably extend to Bonanza Creek,
with branches up the several gold-pro
ducing creeks, the main line continuing
from Bonanza up El Dorado and across
the divide to Indian River. The object of
the promoters will be to extend the line
at a very early day as far as Stewart
River, and ultimately to the mouth of the
Pelly. opposite Fort Selkirk. It will in all
probability form part of an All-Canadian
route to Dawson. '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1901.
TRAIN ROBBER
IS IDENTIFIED
St. Louis Suspect Is the
Man Wanted in
Montana.
Harry Longbaugh and Laura
Bullion Indicted on Sev
enteen Counts.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 13.â The November
Federal Grand Jury to-day returned In
dictments against Harry Longbaugh,
alias "John Arnold," the mysterious Mon
tana train robber suspect, and his com
panion, Laura Bullion. They were In
dicted on seventeen separate counts each.
Charles H. Smith and Michael F.
O'Neill, express messenger and fireman
respectively of the Great Northern flyer
that was held up last July near Wagnei'.
Mont., arrived here this afternoon and
identified the suspect under arrest as
Harry Longbaugh, the man who held up
the train and took the lead in intimidat
ing the train crew and blowing open
the express company's safe, from which
nearly $100,000 in unsigned bills of the
National Bank of Helena were stolen.
O'Neill says that Longbaugh is the man
who climbed over the tender and held
up Engineer Josephs and then superin
tended the blowing up of the safe. His
recollection of the episode was so vivid
that he could describe the two revolvers
that the robbers used. The police say
they are the same weapons that were
found on the prisoner when he was ar
rested.
Smith and O'Neill came to St. Louis ac
companied by C. F. Elliott of the ex
press company from whose safe the bank
notes were stolen.
Robber Merely Sniffs.
Longbaugh never flinched when thi
identification v.'as made. He merely
looked at the men and sniffed contemptu
ously. Chief Desmond asked Longbaugh
his real name.
"I will talk when the time comes,"
was the reply, ar.d not another word coul:l
the chief get out of the stubborn pris
oner.
"I first saw this man when we were
about 500 yards out of Malta," said
O'Neill. "I was shoveling coal and 1
looked up and saw him coming over the
tender. He had a big pistol in his left
hand and a smaller one in his right hand
When he saw that 1 had seen him he
covered me with his pistol and told me to
go on with my work. I complied. Then
he came on toward me and the engineer,
T. R. Jones. He kept one pistol on m>;
and the other on Jones.
" 'What does this mean?' asked Jones.
" 'It means that it is a hold-up and
that it is going through,' the fellow said.
as he climbed c n the seat by the engi
neer's side."
Story of the Robbery.
Fireman O'Neill then related in detail
the story of the robbery, adding:
"After looting the safe and getting the
money, they had horses standing there
and they rode away at a gallop, shooting
all the while."
O'Neill said that for eight miles he.
rode in the same cab with the suspec".
He studied his features carefully. Ha
said when the robbery occurred Long
baugh had a short and stubby mustache.
It did not seem so dark then as it does
now.
Chief Desmond says that he now thinks
that the suspect's real name is Ben Kil
patrick.
"A tall Texan," answering the suspect's
description, was implicated in several
train and bank lobberies in the West, and
he was known- as Kilpatrick.
Elliott. O'Neill and Smith will remain in
St. Louis a day or two. The men may
testify in the United States court if it
is decided to continue the prosecution
here.
Since this last evidence has turned up
it may be deemed best to take him to
Montana for trial, where the offense of
train robbing ! s punishable by death.
BEAR ADMIRAL EVANS
TO GET A NEW BILLET
Secretary Long Selects Him for
Second in Command at Asiatic
Station.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â Secretary
Long intends to send Rear Admiral Rob
ley D. Evans out to the Asiatic station
to be second officer in command. Both
Admiral Remey, commander in chief of
that station, and Admiral Kempff, junior
squadron commander, will return soon to
the United States, having served out the
term allotted for service in Asiatic
waters. This will leave Rear Admiral
Rodgers, now in senior command of the
squadron, in supreme command. Though
i". has not yet been decided, it is prob
able that there will not then be three
admirals on the Asiatic station as at
present, for men of this rank are needed
for service at home, and two rear ad
mirals, it is thought, will suffice.
ENTIRE PLANT OF MINE
SINKS INTO AN ABYSS
JOPLIN, Mo., Nov. 13.â 1n a cave-in at
Oronogi, near here, to-day, the entire
plant of the Aurora Mining Company,
one of the greatest producers in the dis
trict, was swallowed up. No lives were
lost. The plant comprised a hundred-ton
mill, office building and engine-house, all
of which were engulfed, together with
six gravel cars and an immense tailing
pile.
Workmen heard the timbers cracking
and signaled to be drawn up. The last
man had reached the surface only a few
minutes when the timbers collapsed, the
earth yielded, and with a crash the whole
plant sank into the abyss. Further cav
ing is feared and work in that vicinity
has been suspended. It is impossible to
estimate the damage.
Reduced Cable Rates to Philippine!?
LONDON, Ncv. 13.âSir John Wolf

ments with the American authorities in
the Philippine Islands to reduce the cable
rates, beginning November 15. The chair
man said he did not fear the projected
American and German competition on ac
count of the Eastern Telegraph Com
pany's concessions in Pacific regions.

RAILWAY FIGHT
NOW AT AN END
Satisfactory Adjustment
of Northern Pacific
Controversy.
Community of Interest Idea
Adopted by the Con
testing Roads.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â There were two
important developments to-day in the
railway situation in the Northwest and
both tended to confirm the existing be
lief that a final basis of settlement of
the contest for control of the Northern
Paciilc has been finally agreed to. Final
ratification of this agreement will bring
into existence the greatest and most ef
fective example of the community of 'n
terest Idea as applied to the railroad sys
tem of the country.
The first of to-day's developments was
the incorporation at Trenton, N. J., of the
Northern Securities Company, with a
capital stock of $400,000,000, and the sec
ond was the unanimous adoption by the
Northern Pacific directors of a resolu
tion providing- for the retirement at par
of the company's preferred stock on Jan
uary 1, 1902.
There was a full attendance at the meet
ing at which this action was taken, those
present including George Baker and
Charles Steele, representing J. P. Morgan
& Co., E. H. Harriman of the Harriman
syndicate, which is in control of the
Union Pacific; J. J. Hill, president of the
Great Northern; Samuel Kea, vice presi
dent of the Pennsylvania; James Stillma.n,
of the National City Bank; H. McK.
Twombley, for the Vanderbilts, and W.U
liam Rockefeller.
The directors decided that the funds
necessary for tht> retirement of the pre
ferred stock should be obtained by the
sale at not less than par of 75,000,000 four
per cent bonds convertible into common
stock, each holder of common stock now
outstanding being entitled to purchase at
par an amount equal to seventy-five eigh
tieths of the amount of his special hold
ings. It was further provided that two
dividends of 1 per cent each be paid on the
preferred stock before its retirement.
No Official Statement Obtainable.
Samuel Spencer was elected a member
of the board in place of Robert Bacon,
resigned, and the board organized by re
electing all of the company's present offi
cers.
No official statement was obtainable this
afternoon as to the scope of the newly
incorporated Northern Pacific securities,
but It was generally understood that the
company was formed to take over and
control the shares of the Northern Pa
cific and the Great Northern railroads
and their leased lines. The Great North
ern's outstanding capital is $125,000,000 par
value, selling at 200 in the market, while
the Northern Pacific's total outstanding
stock, after the retirement of the pre
ferred, will be $80,000,000 par value, mak
ing a total of $205,000,000 par value for thj
shares of these two companies. At 200
for Great Northern the amount would be
increased to $330,000,000 for the shares of
the two companies.
Burlington shares, it is understood, are
not to be turned over to the Northern Se
curities Company. That stock Is now heid
as collateral for the outstanding Burling
ton collateral bonds, with voting rights
vested in the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern ' railways. It is under
stood that the Union Pacific and Chicago
and Northwestern interests agree to the
retirement of the Northern Pacific pre
ferred and that Union Pacific will have a
heavy interest in the capital of the new
company considerably beyond the par
value or their present Northern Pa
cific share holdings, which are placed at
$78,000,000, par value, just over a majority
of the total $155,000,000 Northern Pacific
stock capital. No information was ob
tainable as to what share, if any, the
Vanderbilts and the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul are to have in the new com
pany.
Under the new arrangement the Union
Pacific Railway will have voting rights
in the Burlington, the directors being
about evenly divided between the Union
Pacific and the Hill interests. The sug
gestion was made to-day that the Bur
lington stock may be held in a voting
trust under the agreement between the
two interests. In this case J. P. Morgan
will be a voting trustee.
After the meeting of the Northern Pa
cific directors, J. J. Hill and George F.
Baker went to Morgan's office and had a
conference with him. Later Jacob Sehilf,
of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and E. H. Harriman
called. All declined to be interviewed.
A member of the firm of J. P. Morgan
& Co said that the Northern Securities
Company would be the holding company
of the various roads interested, but he de
clined to say what railroads these were,
on the ground that t\te details are not
vet completed, and premature publication
might interfere with their consummation.
"You may rest assured," said he, "that
all difficulty over the Northern Pacific
matter Is now at an end, and this has
been accomplished in a manner highly
satisfactory to all concerned."
Retiring the Preferred Stock.
The resolutions adopted by the directors
of the Northern Pacific providing for the
retiring of the preferred stock set forth
the terms of the agreement of July 13,
1896, where J. Pierpont Morgan & Co.,
acting for the reorganization managers,
turned over to the Northern Pacific Rail
way Company 750,000 shares of preferred
and 800,000 shares of common stock, and
that it was expressly provided In the
agreement that the preferred stock could
be taken up at par on the first day of any
January prior to 1907.
The resolutions show that at a meeting
of the Northern Pacific directors, July 8,
1896 a form of certificate for the preferred
stock bearing these conditions was adopt
ed and was duly ratified by the stock
holders. Every certificate of the $75,000,000
preferred stock now outstanding therefore
bears this provision. The resolutions con r
tinue:
Whereas, The holders of the majority of the
cemmon stock of the Northern Pacific Railway
Company have requested the board of dlrectora
to take all such action as may be requisite to
retire the whole of its preferred stock upon the
first day of January, 1902, and have given satis
factory assurances that the necessary moneys
for that purpose will be furnished and that all
action requisite for that purpose will be taken
by the holders of the common stock; and
Whereas, In the judgment of the board of
directors, It ia desirable that this company
should now exercise the option to retire the
preferred stock, it Is unanimously
Resolved That the Northern Pacific Company
In the exercise of its right specifically ex
pressed in each and every certificate of stock
of this company has determined and hereby
does determine to retire the preferred stock of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company In
whole at par upon the first day of January,
1902.
Under the resolutions the transfer books
will close for the retirement of the pro
posed issue on December 10. The final
dividend of 1 per cent will be payable on
and after January 1, 1902.
The Herald to-morrow will state that
the Northern Pacific stock will go Into
the "new holding" company around 115
and the Great Northern around 180.
Wins on the Official Count.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 13.â The official
count of the recent election in Philadel
phia County, which was completed to
day, reveals the fact that J. Harry Davis,
Republican, one of the candidates on the
Union party ticket for Judge of the Com
mon Pleas Court, No. 5, was elected over
Henry Budd. Democrat, his colleague on
the Union ticket. The unofficial figures
last week apparently elected Budd by
about 400 plurality, but the official count
shows Davis to have received 195 votes
more than Budd. Three Judges were to
be elected for this court, each elector be
ing entitled to vote for two candidates,
thus assuring the minority party repre
sentation In the court. The Republican
candidates were elected as the other mem
bers of the court.

GREAT PROGRESS
AT BLIND HOME
Superintendent Sanders
Makes a Record for
Operating.
His Annual Report Shows a
Marked Increase in
Earnings.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 13.
Under the direction of Superintendent
Sanders, a blind man, the State Home for
Adult Blind has made a remarkable rec
ord during the working year ended Octo
ber 1. The superintendent has submitted
a report to the board of directors for the
year, showing that the inmates of the in
stitution have earned by their own labor
the gratifying sum of nearly $10,000. The
industrial department has been placed
upon a solid and profitable basis. Not a
dollar was lost because of bad debts.
In the broom department 39,698 brooms
and 8476 whisk brooms and toy brooms
were manufactured. In addition there
was an output of 170 mattreses, 110 pillows
and 889 recaned chairs during the twelve
months. Practically all of the product
has been sold at satisfactory prices. The
Increase in the output is exhibited by the
following conparative figures:
November, 190fJ â Brooms manufactured,
106; sold, Â«37. October, 1901 â Brooms man
ufactured, 5854; sold, 5247.
The collections for the year were $7314 17,
of which $2883 32 was disbursed among
the inmates, affording them means to ob
tain many little luxuries and comforts
not supplied by the State.
The actual receipts for the year, includ
ing accounts outstanding, are $9324 41. Be
sides the amount paid for labor in the
shops, commissions are also allowed in
mates for their individual sales of brooms.
John P. Irish, president of the board of
directors, has expressed much satisfaction
over the superintendent's showing. He
considers Mr. Sanders to be an expert in
handling the difficult problems attending
treatment of the adult blind.

POLICE UNABLE TO FIND
CLEW TO THE MURDERS
Mystery Surrounding the Killing of
Two Indiana Women Remains
Unsolved.
EVANSVILLE. Ind., Nov. 13.â A1l the
efforts of the entire police and detectlvu
forces of this city to find a clew to the
murderer or murderers of the two wo
men whose dead bodies were found lying
in ditches by the roadside in opposite
directions from this city yesterday have
proven unavailing. Several suspects are
under surveillance, but developments in
the murders have not been sufficient to
warTant the police in making arrests.

were killed about the same hour Tuesday
night, it is still believed the women were
slain by the same fiend.

rested as a suspect. He was with Mies
Renner on Tuesday, but Kifer succeeded
in convincing the police that he was in
nocent of the crime. Miss Renner was
the daughter of well-known and highly
respected parents In Jasper.

THREE CHICAGO DOCTORS
Ki^-r â *
Failed to Bo for Miss Mabelle L.
LaMonte What Was Accom-
plished by Lydia Â£. Piflkham's
vegetable Compound.
" Dkab Mrs. Pixxham: â I was in
an awful state for nearly three years
with a complication of female troubles
which three physicians called by dif-
ferent names, but the pains were all
the same. I dreaded the time of my
MARITT.T.R L. LaMOXTE.
I monthly periods for it meant a couple
of days in bed ii> awful agony. I final-
ly made up my mind that the good
doctors were guessing ; and hearing
from different friends such good re-
ports of Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound, I tried that. I
bless the day I ; did, for it was the
dawning of a new life for me. I used
five bottles before I was cured, but
when they were taken I was a well
woman once more. Your Compound is
certainly wonderful. Several of my.
friends have used it since, and nothing
but the best do I ever hear from its
use." â Yours. Mabelle L. LaMostk,
23 E. 31st St., Chicago, 111.â $5000
forfeit If above testimonial is not genuine.
If Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound could cure Miss
LaMonte â why not you ? .Try it
and see for yourself .

A MURPHY CONSPIRACY
Accuses Former Husband of Trans
ferring Property to Evade Col
lection of Judgment.
Vera Helen Gertrude Jenner filed an
amended complaint to the suit she filed
some time agro against her ex-husband,
Bertram Samuel Joseph Fennestone O'Neill
Murphy, and his brother. Daniel T. Mur
phy. In the amended complaint Mrs.
Jenner alieges that the man with the
numerous Christian names and his
brother have entered Into a conspiracy to
defraud her of $S2M 15. the amount of a
judgment she obtained against him in the
Superior Court last year. When Mrs.
Jenner got a divorce from Murphy in
England the court awarded her $250 per
month alimony. Her husband never paid
it. and she brought suit here for the
amount due. She now asks that a re
ceiver be appointed to care for the prop
erty, which her former husband deeded
to his brother as far back as ISB6, and
again in 1896. She alleges that the trans

of her claim against it.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1901.
VESSEL IS DRIVEN TO DESTRUCTION
IN HURRICANE OFF PORT MARGARET
The Overdue British Ship Giencaird Goes Ashore After Being
Buffeted About Cape Horn for Nearly a Month â Captain English
and All but Three of His Men Perish After Taking to the Boats
THE BRITISH SHIP GLENCAIRD GOING TO PIECES ON THE ROCKS OFF THE SHORE OF STATEN ISLAND,
SOUTH AMERICA. THE VESSEL IS A TOTAL LOSS AND ALL BUT THREE OR HER OFFICERS AND CREW
WERE LOST.
THE overdue British ship Glencaird
is a total loss. She was nearly
seven months out from England,
and 35 per cent was paid on her
by the underwriters, but there
were few takers, as everybody thought
the vessel would come in. The Merchants'
Exchange, however, received cable news
from Buenos Ayres yesterday that the
vessel had been wrecked, and neaVly all of
the crew drowned.
The Glencaird came to grief off Port
Margaret, Staten Island, at the southern
extremity of South America. She was
driven on the rocks in a violent storm.
The officers and crew took to the boats
and made an attempt to reach the shore,
but of the thirty-three souls on board
only three escaped. The remainder, in
cluding Captain English, the second of
licer and the third officer, perished.
With two members of the crew the
first officer drifted for several days in an
open boat, without food or water. They
were finally rescued by the Chaco, bound
for Buenos Ayres. The shipwrecked men
were half dead when taken aboard the
steamer.
Continuing her voyage the Chaco picked
up the crew of another vessel which had
been lost. The French ship Astrea, which
sailed from Shields July 12, for Valparaiso,
took fire when off Cape St. John. When
all hope of saving her was gone the cap
tain and his men abandoned the burning
vessel and took to the boats. The Astrea
was abandoned October 8. The captain,
the first officer, second officer and twenty
one of the crew were found and rescued
by the Chaco. Six of the Astrea's sailors
who were in one of the small boats are
still missing, and it is supposed that they
were drowned.
The Glencaird and the Astrea sailed
from the same port, Shields, England,
though the G'encaird left two months be
fore the French ship, but both were lost
in the same locality.
Captain English of the Glencaird was one
of the best known of the masters who
come to San Francisco. He had a host of
friends here and many of them "played"
the vessel as a sure arrival. The weather
that drove her on Staten Island must
have been terrific. Reinsurance on the
Roanoke and others of the overdue fleet
is now sure to take a jump. The Glencaird
was consigned to Meyer, Wilson & Co.
of this city.
CUT IN SAILORS' WAGES.
Men Who Man the Honolulu Flefit
Suffer a Reduction.
The sugar fleet will pay a reduced rate
to its hands this winter. During the
spring, summer and autumn the general
rate has been $35 a month. Now the best
figure is $30 and the chances are that it
will go to $25 before the month is out. Ac
the present time there are more vessels
than men on the coast, and while the
men are ready to work, there is nothing
for the vessels to do. Sailors are on the
beach by the score and with a reduction
in wages vessels that would otherwise be
laid up will be kept in commission. The
chances are that many a vessel will be
run at a loss during the coming winter.
Kentucky Stallion for New Zealand.
One of the handsomest stallions ever
shipped from San Francisco will leave
here on the Ventura to-morrow for New
Zealand. He is one of the most perfect
animals ever bred in Kentucky. He has
all the attributes of a perfect road hors.j
and for that purpose he was purchased.
To get him to New Zealand will cost his
present owner over $1000, but even with
that assessment he will be deemed cheap
