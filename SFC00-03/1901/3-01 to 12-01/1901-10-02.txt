LONDON, Oct. 2.â Within two weeks the

upon its third year, and In the face of the
recrudescence of organized operations by
the Boers and of the Impossibility of
carrying out Mr. Eroderick's promise to
reduce the war expenditures by sending
home some troops, the Government
organs are again becoming restless.
There is a mystery surrounding the
operations, and the whole situation in
Xatal and the denials and evasions of the
War Office concerning the alleged friction
between Mr. Broderick and Lord Kitch
ener form the subject of editorial protests
on all sides.

SACRAMENTO, " Oct. 1.â The Demo
cratic City Convention to-night nom
inated James H. Devine for Mayor with
out a dissenting voice. This makes the
fifth candidate in the field for the office
of Mayor, the others being William Land,
Republican; L. Tozer, Municipal League;
George H. Clark, Independent, and S. E.
Alderman, Socialist.
Old politicians declare that the cam
paign, which will close early In Novem
ber, will be one of the hottest waged
here in many years. George H. Clark,
the Incumbent, has cast defiance into the
teeth of the Republican organization, and
has even placed an immense electric sign
announcing E*t candidacy on top of the
very building in which the Republicans
maintain their headquarters.
In accepting the nomination to-night
Devine said that he had no newspaper to
support him and no electric devices to
light him on his \u25a0way. He openly charged
William Land with having, while in the
office of Mayor three years ago, betrayed
the Interests of the people in the matter
of buying up city bonds of questionable
validity. Devine pronounced against the
proposed mechanical filtration plan, say
ing that It -would cost vast sums to op
erate it. He oeclared that now, while
Sacramento was on the eve of making
many cosily improvements, the taxpay
ers Bhould be watchful of the men they
put into office.
Five Candidates Are Now Racing for
the Office and a Warm Cam

Although the special had the right .^of
way over the Southern Pacific system
from Ogden to Oakland, it was side
tracked this morning at Port Costa to al
low other special trains to reach the Oak

carried across the Straits of Carquinez at
the same time as the Morgan special was
ferried across on the Solano.
.It was exactly 8 a. m. yesterday when
the Morgan ' special pulled into the depot
on the Oakland j mole. The passengers
were at breakfast In. the dining car and
did not leave trie train until an hour later.
William H. Crocker was at the depot to
receive Bishop Potter and Mr. Morgan,
and a prominent figure was that of Louis

sent to this city by Morgan to take charge
of the cuisine of the Crocker mansion,

When the special train pulled out of the

morning at 8 o'clock orders were given
that it was to make record time. The

in exactly four days after the 'start was
made from Gotham. .

The car occupied by Mr. Morgan Is the

was not one that can be designated as
luxurious and did not compare in equip

The train crew consisted of . eighteen
persons, including, the "porters, waiters,
two electricians and a stenographer. The
entire train was vestibuled and lighted by
electricity.
The train was made up of the composite
car Atlanta, carrying the baggage and the
electric dynamo for lighting the train; the
sleeping car Petruchio, the dining car
Hollenden, the private car Columbia, oc
cupied by Bishops Potter and Doane; the
private car Genesta, occupied by Mr.
Morgan, and the observation car Alroy.

and sisters of more humble degree as they
went through the usual details of a

The chief event of yesterday was the
coming of the special train of J. Pierpont

of New Tork, Bishop Doane of Albany,
Rev. Dr. Greer of New York and a num

Duchess of Cornwall completed their

and to-morrotv \u25a0will set their faces east
ward and toward home. They arrived
her<> this morning and were given one of
the most enthusiastic receptions of their
trip. There were many. Americans in the
great crowd that gathered -here for the
roval visit and an address presented to
the Duke by the American-British League
of Seattle was acknowledged in the gen
eral response made by the Duke to the
foimal welcomes. Perfect weather pre
vailed throughout the day and the city
was in an attractive dress cf flags and
bunting.
The last stage of the westward trip
from Vancouver to Victoria was made on
the steamship Empress of India; whicti
was accompanied by the cruisers War
spite. Amphion. Phaeton and Condor; the
destroyers Sparrow Hav.'k and Virago:
and the, Dominion steamer Quadra. As
the fleet neared Victoria the cruisers ran
ahead r.nd dropped anchor and dressed
ship, and when the Empress . of India
steamed in their puns roared out a royal
salute and the bluejackets manned ti" 1 .*
yards. A shore battery at Work Point
, took up the refrain of the guns, firing an
; other royal salute. Great crowds rilled
the shore driveway and the streets radi
ating from the outer wharf and when the
royal party landed there was a long cheer
of welcome.
Duke Rssponds to Welcome. i
Sir Wilfrid Laurier presented Lieuten- !
ant Governor Sir Henri Jo'.y and the ;
members of the local reception commit- ;
tee, who showed the Duke and Duchess '
to their carriages. The drive to the Par- :
liament buildings, where the formal wel
come was extended, was through crowded
streets, decorated with flags and stream- i
ers. The civic address was read by Mayor !
Hayward. after which addresses from the
Presbytery of British Columbia and the i
American-British League of Seattle -were j
offered. The latter address was present*-! :
by John W. Pratt of Seattle, and said in ]
part:
' We rejoice at the prowing unity of spirit be
tween the great constitutional empire and the
great republic, and we have observed with in- j
tense the appreciation by the ;
American peopls of the friendly purposes mam- !
fested toward them by his Majesty and the i
British Government. â¢
The Duke in his reply said In part:
I desire to assure you of the gratitude which \u25a0
th* X'uehess end I feel for the -kind words of
welcome and srood wishes which are expressed j
Jr. the welcome you have expressed on behalf j
of the citizens of Victoria, the residents of i
Seattle and other parts of the State of Wash
ington and the British Columbian Synod of ths
Presbyterian church in Canada. I shall haw
much pleasure in informing: my deÂ»r father.'
the Kins, with what special satisfaction I
have noted your Etront declaration of loyalty
to the throne and pride in the heritage of citi
zenrhip. . I know what proof of this spirit you
have already given in the blood of your eons !
which I'.as been shed on the South African !
veldt. 1 am confident the sacrifices you have :
made- will not be in vain. They have forged !
another link in the golden chain which binds
together the British empire.
The Duke then presented medals to the
Victorians who served In South Africa,
after which he and the Duchess went
among the school children, who were all
marshaled in front of the Parliament

quimalt and were entertained at lun
cheon by Admiral Bickford on the war
ship Warspite. When the Duke r.nd
Duchess reached Esquimalt the ships
fired a royal salute and the yards were
manned. ' Later in the afternoon the
Duke and Duchess returned to the city
and drove to the exhibition grounds,
passing en route through the Chinese
quarter, which was fantastically decor
ated in their honor.
The Duke spoke briefly in opening the
exhibition, and, with the Duchess,
looked at many of the exhibits. To-night
the ducal party were entertained at din
ner in Government House, and in. turn
gave a reception in the Parliament build
ing:. The latter was brilliantly illumin
ated, and the reception made one of the
prettiest affairs of the day.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 1.â In a run
away accident at Colton, three miles from
this city, yesterday, Charles Medhurst
was instantly killed and Captain R. J.
xaartin fatally injured. Both men are
members of the Board of City Trustees or
Colton and are prominent fruit growers
of this section.
Mr. Medhurst and Captain Martlii were
returning from the former's ranch north
of the city with a load of furniture. Just
as they were nearing the Santa Fe tracks
the horses became frightened and ran
away. The" team , had not gone 200 yards
when Medhurst and Martin were thrown
out of the wagon, near the Santa Fe sta
tion. Â«Â£he wheels of the heavy wagon
crossetrthe small of Medhurst'a back and
killed him instantly. His ribs were crushed
in and it is believed the bones pressed
upon his heart. \u25a0
Martin was thrown from the wagon and
struck on his head. A heavy piece of
furniture fell upon him, breaking several
ribs and injuring him internally. Dr.
Champion, whd is attending him. says
there is but little chance of his living.
Charles Medhurst came to Colton from
Iowa thirteen years ago. He was 63 years
of age. To-morrow would have been his
birthday, and his aged wife had prepared
a surprise for him in the nature of a
family reunion and a birthday dinner.
"SOONEHS" WILL HAVE
CHANCE AT THE LAND
Old System Likely to Be Adopted at
Opening of Two Indian
Reservations.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 1.â The Interior
Department is rapidly completing plans
for the opening of the Fort Hall (Idaho)
â¢Indian reservation. The date 'for the
opening has not yet been fixed, as the
preliminary work has not been completed,
but it is expected that the reservation,
which contains 400.000 acres, will be
thrown open to settlement within a few
weeks.
The Quinault reservation in "Washing
ton, comprising 200,000 acres, probably will
be thrown open to settlement next spring.
The contract for surveying the reserva
tion is about to be awarded. Commis
sioner Herman of the General Land Of
fice said to-day that it was probable that
the old "sooner" system would be adopted
at the opening of both these reservations.
PORTLAND, Oct. 1.â Mrs. Emily Mash

not far from Manila. The body will be
sent to this city for burial.
Soldier's Body Recovered*.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 1.â There were devel
opments of an interesting nature in. the
Chinese smuggling cases to-day, and after
telegraphic communication between the
Collector's office in this city and the Dis
trict Attorney's office in Los Angeles the
order came to place Tom "Wing Chew,
alias Lee Cheong, under arrest. The Mon
golian has been indicted already for aid
ing and abetting Chinese in their efforts
to avoid the exclusion laws and was out
under $l00o bail, with a Chinese as surety.
The discoveries of this morning- make it
evident that he was concerned in the
bringing into this country of three Chi
nese v/no were arrested on Saturday, two
of whom were ordered deported on Mon
day. Collector Bowers and Chinese In
spector You went to the jail and searched
tne effects of the Chinese and found full
directions from Lee Cheong as to how
they should act on arriving in Los An
geles, to which city they were purchas
ing tickets when arrested. The letters
were to Chinese in Los Angeles who were
to meet the three when they reached the
Angel City, and they are all signed by Lee
Cheong.
In the letters it was said that the bear
ers were strangers in the* country and
should be taken care of until they could
be sent forward to San Francisco. There
was also a copy of a telegram which the
Los Angeles Chinese was to send tt> Lee
Cheong' s brother in San Francisco as
soon as the three were satisfactorily
started for the metropolis.
On the request of District Attorney Val
entine at Los Angeles, Lee Cheong's bail
was raised in the. former case from $1000
to $25,000 by the Federal court and Depu
ty United States Marshal Place was di
rected to take him into custody. He was
found in Chinatown and made an ineffect
uul effort to escape. A new complaint
will be sworn to in the morning by Col
lector Bowers, charging Cheong with aid
ing and abetting the advewx or the three
Mongolians and, if held, there will be
another case for the Federal Grand Jury.
The three Chinese are supplied with
fraudulent certificates of residence in this
country, all of which purport to have
been made out and signed in 1894, when
all Chinese were compelled to register.
These certificates were supposed to give
some of the characteristic marks of the
Chinese registered and to carry the photo
graphs of the men. The seal of the In
ternal Revenue Collector was. so placed
that it stamped the photograph as well
as the certificate, and it was evidently
thought that this wo.uld prevent the
changing of the photographs. Chinese die
as well as other people, and it is claimed
by the customs officials that the certifi
cates of the dead as well as of those who
have returned to China to remain are kept
for use by such other Chinese as may de
sire to come over. Old photographs are
soaked off and new ones substituted.
In order to get around the matter of the
seal, a bogus seal has been made. It is
a facsimile Of "O. M. "Welburn, Internal
Revenue Collector," who was in charge of
the revenue district of California when
the certificates were first issued.

The principal subject discussed was
that of a cable to Hawaii. Guam and the
Philippines. Propositions have been made
to lay a. commercial cable from San Fran
cisco to connect these islands, and tho
question under discussion was whether
under our peace treaty with 'Spain the
United States could authorize or In any
way encourage the layfng of such a cable
by private parties.
Under a franchise obtained from Spain
some time before the late war the ex
clusive right to cable connections with
the Philippines was secured by a foreign
corporation. Under the treaty of Paris
the United States obligated itself to pro
tect all property rights in the archipel
ago, and the question now at Issue Is
whether permission to land the proposed
cable at Manila or some other Philippine
port would be a violation of the terms of
the Paris treaty.
The Attorney General will prepare a
statement for the President covering all
the questions involved.

State Chairman "William* Gurley was
made permanent chairman without oppo
sition. . Resolutions were confined to State
issues. The following nominations for
Governor were made: Ex-Congressman
Thomas M. Ferrell of Glosboro, Mayor
James M. Seymour of Newark, ex-Judge
Howard Carrow of Camden, - Senator
Christian Braun of Passaic and James E.
Martins of Union.
The anti-Seymour people made an effort
to concentrate their strength on Ferrell
and succeeded to the extent of securing
480 votes for him on the first ballot, which
was only eight less than the number
given to Seymour. On the second ballot
the scattering vote went largely to Sey
mour and accomplished his nomination.
The first ballot stood: Seymour, 488; Fer
rell, 480; Braun, 51; Carrow. 68; Martln3,
22; necessary to choice, 574. On the second
ballot Seymour gained fifty-six- votes,
most of which came through his getting
the vote of Morris and Warren counties.
Ferrell lost only eleven votes, but Sey
mour was within thirty votes of nomina
tion, and then began a general stampede.
When the vote was finally announced it
stood 779 for Seymour, with the remaining
votes for Ferrel!.
TRENTON, N. J. f Oct. 1.â Mayor Sey
mour of Newark was nominated on the
second ballot to-day aa the Democratic
candidate for Governor in a convention
that at times was turbulent in the ex
treme. State Chairman William Gurley
was permanent chairman. The first voting
Bhowed that the Seymour and anti-Sey
mour forces were almost evenly divided,
and had tho anti-Seymour leaders been
able to concentrate their vote on a single
candidate they might .have won. How
ever, there was a strong undercurrent
among the delegates for Seymour.
The nomination of "Mayor Seymour was
a defeat for former United States Senator
Smith and his forces and was. a victory
for E. F. C. Young, Robert Davis of Hud
son County and Colonel E. I* Price of
Essex County. \u25a0 4 -
Ex-Judge Robert 'Woodruff of Mercer,
temporary chairman of the convention,
made feeling reference to the late Presi

speaking the band played "Nearer, My
God, to Thee." The vast assemblage rose
and sang the words of the hymn.
The first tumult of the convention broke
out when both of tho chairmen of con
testing delegations from Essex County
tried to name the county's representatives
on the several committees. After the con
vention/ had been in an uproar for some
time and the lle^had been freely passed

"The President feels that it would not
do to permit the Insurgents to long enjoy
the prestige of their success, though it
was achieved by treachery." said a high
official to-day. "He believes that the in
terest of the Philippines and of the
United States demand that there shall be
a prompt suppression of the rebellion.
"We had hoped to reduce the force in the
archipelagro next sprinp. but Mr. Roose
veit had no intention of withdrawing the
troops should the situation require mili
tary attention. Rather he will increase
the army in the far East should it be
shown that reinforcement* are needed."
President Roosevelt, In the meantime. Is
{retting: other information respecting the
coalition of that island, which will enable^
him to frame proper instructions to Gen-*

Lucban, who Is in command of the in
surgents in Samar, only had a force of 200
tlitonm and 400 bolomen, according to re
ports made by an 'American enlisted man
whom he caytured, but this force has
been undoubtedly increased by disaffected
natives and it Is believed that the insur
gent leader now has 25tXi men under his
command. Samar will be a most difficult
island to pacify. Army officers report
that the interior is a jungle, through
which trails lead, and these must be fol
lowed in pursuit of the rebels.
The instructions that President Roose
velt â¢will sand General Chaffee will neces
sarily be general in character, but they
will be explicit as showing his desire that
the disaster must be followed by swift
retribution.

on the Disaster in
Samar.
The latter replied that he could only say
the ship was going as fast as they could make
her go. He thought she must have been going
nine and a half knots an hour. In this con
nection Mr. Raynor asked a number of ques
tions intended to show that the admiral's of
ficial reports and his present statements as
to speed were not consistent.
Mr. Radnor's point was that the official re
port showed, according to measurements, that
the Iowa had made eight miles In half an hour,
but the admiral said that while this tnlpht
be true, according to the land measurements,
it must be borne in mind that he was running
a course at sea. . Admiral Evans was also queÂ»
tlonpd an to his statements concerning the dls
tince the blockading vessels were out at night.
He said yesterday that the vessels of \u25a0 the
blockading pouadron were farther out at night
than during the day. and Mr. Raynor read a'
previous statement from him to the effect that
"at daylight we closed In."
Mr. Raynor th.en questioned the witness as to
the F^eed the Iowa was making when | the
Onuendo nnd the Maria Teresa went ashore.
"1 do not remember being on board the
Brooklyn on the 4th ot July. I think it
was the Bill at Ouantananio. 1 am Quite pos
itive I was on board the Brooklyn off
tar.Uat'0 but once, and that was a long time
betcre that. As to the conversation, 1 never
said to the effect that Captaiu Philip had run
sAv.-uy. or attempted to run away. On think
ing over waat uÂ»d occur with reierence to the
TÂ«:xas, I think Commodore Schley and I dis
cussed tha position oi the Texas when the
tight began. The Texas was lying with her
litauj to thÂ« east and when the engagement
began the had turned with starboard helm
and heaaed ort" in the same direction as the
rest of us., She flrea first with her port bat
tery and tntn put her helm to starboard and
headed in the same direction with the rest
of the ships. I think that is the question I
discussed with Commodore Schley. I cannot
ue sure of it. but that I over intimated that
Captain Philip attempted to run away witn
the Texas is preposterous on the face of It."
"Did you have a conversation with him on
the samo day at the same place and at the
same hour, or at any other place, in which
you used substantially the following language:
"I shot the bow off the Pluton. the stern off
the Furor, put my helm to starboard and raked
th"e Teresa and knocked out the Vlscaya?' "
"To the best of my knowledge and belief I
never used such language."
â¢â¢Were not the commanding officers called on
board the flagship Brooklyn by signal on tho
morning of May Â£9. after the Colon was dis
covered?"
"They were."
"Can you tell me or do you recollect what
took place at the conference of the command
ing olficers at that time?"
"Commodore Schley was In the cabin of the
Brooklyn when we assembled, and there was a
general talk about the Spanish fleet having
been located at last at Santiago. X do not
recollect any special conference. I don't think
it was in the nature of a conference. I do not
recollect now that the officers wero^asked to
express any opinion. . I remember having a
conversation with Commodore Schley about the
effect of the fighting batteries on the ship?,
in which I told him of the experience we had
had at San Juan and expressed the opinion to
him that It wat not worth while to risk ships
fighting shore batteries alone: that I did % not
think anything would be gained by it. * In
the case under consideration the Spanish ships
were present in the harbor. The conditions
were changed, and we would have to take the
risk of the fire from the batteries in order to
get at them. I remember Commodore- Schley
remarking before we left that he felt that tho
country held him responsible: that the ships
should not be risked under the fire of the
shore batteries until the Spanish fleet was de
stroyed."
"I want to call your attention to the report
of Captain McCalla of the Marblehead. on page
426 of the appendix, which says: 'Commodore
Schley explained to the commanding officers
that in case the Spanish ships came out he
wished to concentrate the batteries of all our
ships on a portion of those of tho enemy. This
was not explained as a tactical concentration
of our whole force on a part of the enemy,
but as a division of our whole flre on several
of the enemy's ships. During: the time the
commanding officers were on board the flag
ship Captain Evans asked Commodore Schley
if it were his Intention to steam at the ene
my's ships in case they should start to come
out. Commodore Schley answered: 'Certain
ly,' and added words indicative of his Intention
to attack them as they came out of the har
bor.' "
"I recollect It perfectly."
"Is that correct?"
"That is correct"
"So there was a plan of battle arranged
by Commodore Schley. waa there hot?"
"There Is nothing there to Indicate It from
what you have read."
"Was not the same order that was afterward
plven by the commander in chief substantially:
'Close In toward harbor entrance and attack
them?"
"You have not read anything about Indi
cating any plan of battle."
Mr. Raynorâ And added the words (reading)
"Indicative of his Intention to attack them as
thÂ»>y came out."
"I want to read you lÂ»ro reports â your re
port of the engagement of the Spanish squad
ron, and I would like you to tell me whether
there Is any conflict between them, nnd if
there is which one of these statements in your
Judgment now Is correct. (Reading) â 'After we
passed, at 10:35. the Oquendo and Maria Teresa,
on fire and ashore, this vessel continued to
chase and fire upon {he Vlscava until 10:3ft.
when signal to cease firing was sounded on
board. It having been discovered that the Vib
caya had struck her colors.' That was at 10:36,
in your report- Now. "I want to read from the
report of the commander-ln-chief. (Reading)â
'The Viscaya was still under the flre of the
leading vessels, the Cristobal Colon had drawn
ahead, leading the chase, and soon passed be
ynnd the ranee of the guns of the leading
American ships. The Vlscaya was soon set
on flre and at 11:15 she turned ln-shore and
was beached at Azerraderos, fifteen miles from
Santiago, burning fiercely, etc.. etc' "
"I have no doubt yon read It correctly."
"Which is correct ? If there is a conflict' be
tween the commander-in-chlef at the time the
Vlscaya went ashore and your report, yours
at 10:36 and his at 11:15. J it becomes a material
point to us which one of these specifications is
correct."
"The time given In that report of mine wa*
furnishM by the navigator and executive offi
cer of the ship. I, of course, did not take the
time."
" "Did you know that Jack Philip started
to run away at the beginning oi the battleY'
and to which Commodore ijchiey replied: 'You
are mistaken about that, Evans; I saw noth
ing of tht kino. The lirooklyn made a turn
iiiitj you iii ut t b^fi tl*iÂ«2 t*ttj tlcÂ«xl irituiition t liiit
made it nt-cessary.' "
We tnen asked: "uitl you have a conver
sation with Commodore sichley on July 4,
tome time during the morniiig. between s and
12 o'clock, on his uagship at Santiago in the
course ot wliicii you used language as fol
lows:
â¢â¢yesterday."' said Mr. Raynor, "I waa
speaking ui a conversation which I thought
you haa at Guantanamo on July a. 1 rind I
have made a mistake about that, and. if
necessary lor me to repeat ray question, I
fcuppoÂ£Â« you will answer in the same way."
Admiral Evans was recalled. Mr. Raynor
betjaii l.is interrogations by asking Â«*he wli
nesa concerning tne secret code of fctguaU for
lonLniumcaucn with the Cuban Insurgents near
Cieniuegcs. Xhe admiral said that when Cap
tain Cuadwick communicated this code to him
he did not. instruct him to give the Informa
tion to Commodore schley. Air. Kaynor then
ijuestioned the witness especially as to his
interviews with \u25a0 Commodore Sc-hiey after the
battle ot Santiago.

"No. 'not to my recollection,"
Captain Sigsbee was then excused and Chief
Yeoman Gustave E. Becker, who served as a
clerk, to Admiral Sampson on board the flag
ship New York during the Spanish war. was
called. He identified the memorandum from
Captain McCalla, saying there was a good
landing place near Cienfuegos. which .Admiral
Sampson sent to Commodore Schley under date
of May 19, and said that this memorandum had
been carried in duplicate by the Iowa and the
Dupont. , Mr. Raynor questioned the witness
very closely, bringing out the> fact that Becker
had no records to show that either of these ves
sels had carried the memorandum, and that he
was dependent upon his memory in making the
statement.
Mr. Hanna said In this connection that the
department expected to be able to show that
four copies of this memorandum had been for
warded to Commodore Schley. Mr.- Raynor re
sponded that he would admit only one copy,
and that was the copy delivered by the Hawk,
on May 23. 1898.
The court adjourned for the day at 4 p. m.
with Becker -still on the stand.
"I am not certain, but my recollection is
that It stated it arrived on the 19th or 21st.
I received the communication' just as I have
stated. It came from the . Secretary of the
Navy. It was signed 'Long,' but whether I
got a copy or Captain Wise got- the original
I cannot tell." \u25a0"
By the Courtâ Did you show this dispatch to
Commodore Schley on May 26?
"I already said I cannot recollect the act oi
showing it to him, I presume -I did, but that
I Informed him I remember."
By the Courtâ Did you see the dispatch' signed
Long" May 20, addressed to the St. Louis,
care the American â¢ Consul, St. Nicholas, prior
to meeting with Commodore Schley on May 26?
"I have no recollection of anything to the
St. Louis." ' '
By the Courtâ Did you see tha dispatch refer
red to addressed to either the Minneapolis. St.
Paul or Harvard? - . \u25a0
â¢ What was the state of thÂ« sea on the af
ternoon of May 26, when you communicated
with the flying squadron to the southward
of the port of Santiago?"
"The sea was heavy for boats, but- it was
moderatingâ that Is to say, more moderate
than it had been on- the two days before. I
should say, however, it would have been diffi
cult to have coaled at sea that night."
"Did Captain Wise communicate to you a
dispatch from the Navy Department stating
that the Spanish squadron was at Santiago?"
"I \u25a0 remember no dirpatch or communication
from Captain Wise to that effect, excepting
that which I received from the Navy Depart
ment through the senior officer at Port Hal
tien on May 21, the dispatch on which I pro
ceeded ultimately to Santiago."
Mr. Hannaâ The dispatch referred to In the
last- question read: 'Washington, May 20, 189S.â
Yale, care American Consul, Cape Hattlen:
The Spanish fleet arrived at Santiago de Cuba
May 19, and as far as your coal \u25a0 permits
proceed at once to Santiago de Cuba,

"I cannot remember that he did."
By the courtâ Did you make an effort to as
certain if the Spanish squadron was at San
tiago prior to May 20?
"Only by extreme watchfulness, that Is all."
By the Courtâ What information had you to
communicate to Commodore Schley on May
26 regarding the whereabouts . of the Spanish
squadron? '
"The department's order to- me directed me
to state that the Spanish squadron waa there

of the Restormel after her very . peculiar
cruise. x

the weather at the time he' was at Santiago,
Captain Sigsbee said:
"During the 24th, 23th and 26th of May the
weather was unsettled; there was more or less
rain and moderately heavy sea on those three
days."
The court asked a number of questions of
Captain Sigsbee. These, with the replies, were
as follows: â¢ \u25a0
matter. I think that either the court or de
lense should allow me to express under caih
what 1 really said. Whether I expressed that
belief or not it may be technically right to
interfere with me, but according to the etliics
or the naval service jl think the 'defense ought
to permit rne to. answer that- question."
"We have no objection to that," said Mr.
Raynor.- â¢ \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 Â»â¢'Â» .
"I have given an answer to that question.
I have said nothing about my belief." .
Mr. Hanna â The portion or the question to
which 1 should like to have you give an ex
plicit answer is whether you assured .Com
modore schley that you believed the Spanish
ile-et was not in Santiago.
"X did not say that 'I believed it was. not
there." I said 'I had not seen it.' "
.."Did you give him any assurance which
would point In that direction?"
"I made known first my orders from the
Navy Department, which stated that the Span
ish fleet was reported to have arriyed there."
Mr. Hanna then' read a letter which Cap
tain Sigsbee had on May 26 written to Com
modore Schley reporting the taking of. the
Pilot Nunez from the Jason and the capture
of the British steamer liestorniel as a prize.
He 6ald In that letter:
"No news here. I have seen absolutely noth
ing of the Spanish fleet." He reported also
that the Restormel had 2400 tons of coal
aboard and said that the commanding officer
had said he was bound for Santiago.
Mr. Hanna alsr> read a number of letters,
among them being one from Captain Sigsbee
to Commodore Schley, written from Mole St.
Nicholas, May 29, in which he said to the
commodore:
"Do as you are doing and you will do right."
He also Informed him that there were a
number of telegrams at the Mole for him but
that none of them were urgent. He told the
commodore that the department expected '. him
to exercise great efforts to keep In coal.
Mr. Hanna â I wish to ask your attention to
the clause: "Do as you are doing and you will
do right." What was the flying squadron doing
at the time you wrote that letter? , ,-.
"That was based on the tenor of the cipher
telegrams found at the Mole from the com
mander in chief and from the Navy Depart
ment, urging 1 that the Spanish squadron be held
and that every effort be made to coal ship.
At that time the flying squadron was off San
tiago with the intention, so far as I knew, of
staying, and .1 also believed It was the in
tention of Commodore. Schley to coal his ships
off that port. I left Santiago on the morning
of the day on which that letter was written.
At that time the weather was very fine and I
had twice urged upon Admiral Schley the im
portance of taking advantage of that particu
lar kind of weather, stating It was better than
any we had had during my stay off the port."
Captain Sigsbee also said that when he. had
boarded the Brooklyn on May 26 Commodore
Schley had told him he was bound for Key
West for coal.
"Did he ask you If you believed the Spanish
fleet was in the harbor of Santiago?" .
"I don't remember him putting the question
In such terms." \u25a0 â¢ - . â¢
The witness recalled a signal from the flag
ship at that time, asking him to - "inform
Sampson that one-half of his squadron Is out
of coal."
Mr. Raynor then questioned the witness
bringing out the statement that the purpose of
his ship being sent to the vicinity of Santiago
was to. If possible, locate the Spanish fleet. He
said that he had first seen the Spanish vessels
In the harbor at Santiago, but that when he
reported the fact he found that the squadron
had already made the discovery. '
Mr. Raynor read an â¢ extract from a report
made by Captain SIpsbee, saying: ;
"In this report off Santiago de Cuba, made
at 10 a, m. May 29, you say: "We were then
steaming at full speed from. Mole St. Nicholas.
Haiti, and well In toward the coast after
chasing some vessels. I saw the smoke of a
number of vessels to the westward, and \u25a0 at
once made for the Santiago entrance/believing
It possible that the strangers were the Spanish
squadron approaching that port.' All I want
to ask Is this: When you saw the smoke after
chasing a number of vessels to the westward
and when you made for the Santiago entrance
on the morning of the 29th you thought that
this was a Spanish squadron approaching the
port?"
"No, I thought it might be the. Spanish
squadron. I did not say they were approaching
the port." jj->-v
"Yes, you say 'approaching the port:'" .'\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0
"You must remember I had no definite In
formation whatever." ...- ..
"Did you. ever megaphone the press boat
Summers H. Smith that the Spanish fleet was
not in the harbor at Santiago?" ' â¢ â¢
â¢ "Never. - One of the press boats hailed me.
saying that Schley had the Spaniards bottled
up at Cienfuegos. I replied that we had had
them bottled up at Santiago for a week." "â¢
Mr. Raynor attempted to quote a statement
from Admiral Sampson to the effect that Cap
tain Sigsbee had said on May 29 that the' fly
ing squadron was blockading Santiago twenty
five miles out at sea, but objection waa made
to bringing Admiral Sampson in and. Mr/ Ray-:
nor asked . Captain Sigsbee whether, he . had
made that report to any one on that date.' .The
witness replied In the negative. ;* . \u25a0 - -â¢ â¢
In reply to a question aa to the condition of
This, the admiral said, was the exact fact,
that after being- out farther at night, the ves
sels came In closer at daylight. He said that
in steaming back and forth at night the ves
sel Juet ahead could be seen, but not the ves
sel at the head of the column. The Marble
head farther In could be occasionally seen, but
the Vixen never.
"AVhlle before Cienfuceos or on the way to
Santiago, did you have any orders for battle?"
asked Mr. Hanna.
'â¢No," responded the witness. "We steamed
in column with Hankers on each sida." "
â¢'Had you any Instructions as to what to do
In case the enemy should appear?" "
"We had not."
STORY OF A CORRESPONDENT.
Newspaper Man Who Was on the
Texas Describes the Loop.
Admiral Evans was then excused and Mr.
Thomas M. Dieualde, a newspaper correspond
ent, who was on board the Texao during \.hs
Santiago campaign, was called.
Mr. Dieualde 6ald that when the battle oft
Santiago bejtan he had been in the room of
the Junior officers of the ship and had Imme
i dlately zone on the bridge with Captain
I'hllip, remaining until the captain had gone
to the lower bridge with him. There he had
remained until the chase of the Colon began.
He had at the time made notes of the battle
and these he read. The Texas was then, he
said, heading in the general direction of the
Spanish fleet.
Mr. Hannaâ Did you see the Brooklyn at
any time after the battle began?
"I saw the Brooklyn about ten or fifteen
minutes after the battle began." . '
"Wan that the first time you saw her during:
the action?"
"I saw her before In the morning."
"Where was she when you first saw her
with respect to the Texas?"
"Off the port bow of the Texas."
"How far away?"
"I would not like to make an estimate of the
distance. It seemed very close. She was so
le:; seaward." â¢
â¢,'Was she headed toward the Texas?" -.\
"She was on a course about right angles to
us at that moment."
"Have you any notes on that subject made
at the time?"
"Yes, sir."
"Please read them." &.
"I have a note at 9:50 in quotation marks,
'Stop both engines, helm hard starboard.' "
"Who save that order?"
"Captain Phill?."
"Where was the Brooklyn when that order
was siven?"
"I presume the Brooklyn was In front of the
Texas. I saw her a moment later."
Mr. Hanna â Did you make any entries at
the time with respect to the passing of the
Brooklyn before the Texas?
"Yes; the next line here (reading), 'It was
Brooklyn â close shave.' "
"Could she have been half a mile away?"
"I should think not; not anything like It.
I would not suppose it was a quarter of a mile
when I saw her. I was standing Just aft of.
the connincr tower, by the entrance. In that
way I heard these orders given and I
wrote them down as Captain Philip gave
them. I went around to the lee side of the
conning tower to find out why we stopped. He
(Philip) waved his hand toward the Brooklyn
and I saw her. He said: 'Look at that fellow
going out to sea.' "
Admiral Dewey â Did you hear Captain
Philip give orders to back the engines?
"No, sir. I do not remember If I did. I
turned away almost immediately,"
Admiral Dewey â You would have If he had
given the order, wouldn't you?
"I might and rnlclit not."
Admiral Deweyâ You seem to have heard
everythlns else.
"Oh, not everything."
Mr. Dieuaide said in response to questions
that he had on the day of the battle written
a report of the battle, but that these facts had
not been riven because Captain Philip had
asked him to "make It nice for everybody,"
and this had been his own Inclination. He
was then excused for the day and asked to
bring his newspaper report of the engagement
Into court to-morrow.
CAPTAIN SIGSBEE EXPLAINS.
Officer Who Commanded the Maine
Takes the Witness Stand.
Captain Charles G. Slgabee. who commanded
the scout ship St. Paul during the Spanish
war, was next called. He said that in obedi
ence to orders from Captain Wise, wlio was
his commanding officer, he had proceeded to
the vicinity of Santiago, arriving there on
the 21st. He told of taking aboard the Cuban
pilot, Nunez, and said that he did not have
great confidence in that individual. His In
structions were to report to Commodore Schley
that the Spanish squadron probably was In
Santiago harbor. He fell in with the flying
squadron on the evening of May 26, the squad
ron then being twenty or twenty-five miles
south of Santiago. He had reported to Com
modore Schley that he "knew nothing posi
tively" about the Spanish fleet. He was then
asked if he had expressed his belief to Com
modore Schley that Cervera's fleet wan not in
the harbor as reported later by Commodore
Schley. A \u25a0 controversy arose over the admis
sibility of the question and the court took
a recess for luncheon before receiving the
reply of the witness.
When the Schley court reconvened after
luncheon Captain Sigsbee resumed his testi
mony. Mr. Hanna repeated his question,
asked before recess, quoting Admiral Schley's
repcrt of .July 18, 1898, the sentence reading:.
"After having been assured by Sigsbee that
he did not i' believe the Spanish fleet was in
Santiago." The witness replied:
"I stated that we had seen nothing of the
Sp-nish fleet. I may have stated that I knew
nothing positively or absolutely about its
movements, but I recited certain events to
show that there was a probability 4 of the
fleet being in Santiago at that time. In re
gard to the other matter, I beg to make an
appeal to the court. This case is one involv
ing reputations. It . has been ' stated by Com
modore â¢ Schley In aa - official letter to the
United States Senate that i expressed a'cer
tain belief. Now It haa been an Important

The open season for ducks and email
was ushered in auspiciously yesterday
by a great throng of sportsmen although
the results were not up to expectations.
Throughout the length of the marsh line
from above Suisun on the north to Al
viso on the south the glistening barrels
of shotguns reflected the too aruent rays
of the sun.
The sport was fairly good on the Al
viso marsh, every one getting some birds.
Few secured the limit bag of fifty birds,
although George Pierce v/as among the
successful ones. Fred King brought home
forty-six. The bags were maue up of
teal, curlew, rail, snipe, sprig and spoon
bills. A number | of sportsmen returned
with well-lilled game bags last night and
reported that many more- remained over

â¢ Up at Suisun marshes the season was
opened early in the morning with rather
poor sport. Few good bags were made
although plenty of ammunition was used.

too high for good shooting. The best
score of the . aay was made by Walter
Cooper, a sixteen-year-old lad, on Stew

light airs giving great satisfaction.
"It looks as if she were only begrinninj
to show her best form," says the Daily
Graphic.- "If that Is so the abortive races
may prove in the end to have been step
ping stones to victory."
It is generally conceded that Sir Thomas
Lipton's chances of lifting: the cup loolc
brighter. Mr. Hamilton, editor of thÂ«
Yachtsman, has declared in an interview
that he thinks the chances of the chal
lenger winning: the cup are "remarkably
good, providing she gets only ordinary
luck, although with a strong wind aft the
Columbia is a marvelously fast vessel."
He expressed the opinion that the Sham
rock II would be seen at her best when
the wind was just strong- enough for her
to carry her jackyard topsail on the wind,
but not her jib topsail. "Under such con
ditions," said Mr. Hamilton, "I believe
she would beat the Columbia over any
course."
Disappointment in London.
LONDON, Oct. 1.â The crowds on the
Thames banks and elsewhere who were
waiting for the announcement of the
yacht race last night were much smaller
than the crowds of Saturday, owing to
the rain and the great disappointment
following the first trial.
GBEAT PBICES PBEVAIL

fifteen minutes after the start, the Co
lumbia following immediately. Once again
the American boat showed her superior
smartness In stays, coming" about much
quicker than her rival and gathering way
as soon as her head sheets were trimmed
down. At 11:30 both yachts were pretty
nearly becalmed, the Columbia having a
lead of about a quarter of a mile. At
11:30 the Shamrock went on the starboard
tack, the Columbia following, and then a
lucky streak filled the Shamrock's sall3
and gave her an appreciable lift. At noon
both yachts were on the port tack, almost
becalmed. The club topsails and jib top
sails were the only sails that puffed out
responsive to the stray streaks of air.
The big mainsails napped as the yachts
rose and fell in the long easterly roll and
the luff of the headaails Quivered. .The
result was that- the yachts barely had
steerage way.
The Unexpected Happens.
Then the unexpected happened. Wafted
along at a fine clip by a stray puff, the
Shamrock overhauled the Columbia and
at 1:15 she was so close that Captain Barr
bore down on her in order to kill her
wind, as he had so often killed the wind
of the Constitution. The Shamrock went
on the port tack, immediately followed by
the Columbia, and in another minute the
The wind now became more south
erly. Both yachts set reaching
jib 'topsails and eased off sheets,
steering a direct . course for the
mark. Then the Shamrock forged ahead
and got into the doldrums, while the Co
lumbia got a slant of wind and at 1:85
passed the Shamrock. Then It was the
Shamrock's turn to get the benefit of a
breeze and she came along and planted
herself on the Columbia's weather quar
ter, crawling up on her until at 2:08 they
were neck and neck, with the British boat
to the windward, blanketing her op
ponent. To escape from this blanket Cap
tain Barr sent the Columbia on the port
tack at 2:32, but luck was against her and
she lost every breath of the fickle wind,
as well as steerage way, and it was near
ly two minutes before she got away and
filled away on the starboard tack again
and by that time the Shamrock was too
far ahead to be overtaken. The first
mark was then close at hand and the
yachts tacked around it as follows:
Shamrock .'... 2:41:36

MAY RACE CONSECUTIVE DAYS.
Meeting Iakely to Be Held to Con
sider This Subject.
NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â E. D. Morgan,
who. with a party of friends, remained
for the night aboard the Park City inside
Sandy Hook,' said to-night:
"To-day's race cannot be discussed from
the point of a critic. It was merely a
succession of flukes and never resembled
a real race. The challenger merely was
more fortunate than the Columbia In
catching the fitful puffs of wind. I regret
extremely the outcome because we were
nil anxious to see what the boats would
do on the triangular course. But as it Is
we are now no wiser than before. So far
as I am able to say there will be no
change in the defender's sails. The pres
ent suit 13 quite satisfactory."
Captain Barr was extremely reticent.
Absolutely no expression could be ob
tained from him upon any point further
than regret over the miserable racing
weather.
While there was no meeting of the New-
York Yacht Club to-night of either the
challenge or the regatta : committee, it
was Intimated that the cup committee of
the club and the representatives of the
Royal Ulster Club might have a meeting
in the near future with regard to having
the yachts raced on consecutive days.
This was done two years ago, after a
number of postponements because of the
lack of wind, similar to the conditions
which prevailed to-day. It requires an
agreement on' the part of both sides to
have the races sailed on consecutive
days, and it is likely that another post
ponement may bring this about. It Is
possible also that some sort of meeting
may be held to-morrow. The next race,
however, will not be- sailed until Thurs
day, although there may be a race Fri
day. . â¢ â¢ \u25a0

NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â To-day's at
tempt to sail the second of the
present series Of international
yacht races for the blue ribbon
of the sea proved a dismal fail
ure. Between 25,000 and 30,000 people who
crowded on the pleasure fleet off Sandy
Hook lightship in the hope of seeing a
repetition of : the thrilling sport of last
Saturday witnessed instead more of a
drifting match than a race. The wind
was exceedingly light and variable, at
times falling so low that the gossamer
wind pennants, which are as light as
thistledown, hung limp against the masts
of the big single-stickers. The wind, with
crews lined up on the lee rails, was not
sufficient at any time to make the racing
machines heel to their lines.
At the end of four and a half hours the
two yachts covered less than one-half of
the prescribed course' of thirty miles, and
as there was no possibility of their fin
ishing within the time limit the regatta
committee declared the race off. When
the gun was fired announcing this deci
sion the challenger was about a half-mile
ahead of the defender, and to that extent
to-day's trial was a victory for the Sham
rock.
Dangerous in Light Airs.
But the fluke to-day demonstrated little
as to the question of .supremacy between
the two boats except, perhaps, that Sir
Thomas' new champion Is more danger-,
ous in light airs thanwas supposed after
her two former meetings with the white
liyer, to which the patriots are pinning
their faith. In tluky winds of variable
strength, shifting as they did to-day
through six points of the compass, luck
cuts almost as much figure as model and
seamanship, ani to-day fortune was un
mistakably with the foreigner. '
The course was a equilateral triangle,
ten miles to the leg. the first leg being a
beat due east into the wind. The Yankee
skipper at the start outgeneraled his ad
versary in a splendid piece of Jockeying,
crossing the line in the windward bertn
twelve seconds ahead of â¢ the Britisher.
This advantage tne Columbia held for
two hours, while both yachts steered far
off the course to the southward, looking
for a streak of wind that would pront
them.
Finally Barr declined longer to continue
the vainless quest. He put his helm down
and headed inshore on the starboard tack.
The Shamrock at this time, after both
had been sailing in the same airs, was a
beaten boat, and her skipper could af
ford to take a gambler's chance with for
tune. He held doggedly on and fortune
smiled on him. Within five minutes he
got a breeze out of the south which ruf
fied the crestless seas and wafted him like
a ghost through the Columbia's weather.
But this was not his best piece of good
fortune. After this reverse the Columbia,
slipping through the seas at an astonish
ing pace, had worked out ahead of the
Shamrock, but to the leeward. When 'the
two vachts were In this position, about
two miles from the first turn, a cant of
the wind threatened to blanket the Colum
bia and to avfcid such a possibility Barr
went under the Shamrock's stern. Just
as he did so the wind hauled around
more to the south, knocking the Colum
bia's head off, until to the astonished
spectators, she seemed headed almost
back to the lightship at the- starting line.
That golden boat, favored by the same
breeze, was headed in exactly the oppo
site direction. Then the wind shifted
back again and when Barr got the Colum
bia straightened out he was a third of a
mile astern. In this position the two
boats rounded the first mark, the Sham
rock three minutes and eight seconds be
fore the Columbia, or a gain for the
Shamrock in the beat to windward, adding
the twelve seconds which the Columbia
beat her over the line, of three minutes
and twenty seconds.
Race Is Declared Off.
During the next hour. In a close reach
for the second mark, the yachts were able
to cover about four or four and a half
miles of the remaining twenty, and as.
only fifty minutes then remained before
the expiration of the time limit, the race
was declared off.
After turning the mark the experts
thought the Shamrock increased her lead
slightly. This gain may, however, be ac
counted for by the fact that she carried a
large reaching sail, while the Columbia
was working close to the wind with a
small baby jib topsail, a mere handker

When the string of signals was hoisted
on the committee boat indicating the

about the" lightship, â¢ performing 'nearly
every known variety of marine maneuv

brand new suit of light weather sails, ad
mirably cut and of marvelous fit. . The
Columbia, however, was obliged to con
tent herself with the same old suit that
carried her to victory on Saturday. ' Be
fore the start the Shamrock hoisted a
tiny jib topsail, perhaps the smallest ever
; carried by a cup yacht. It answered Its
| purpose capitally as a steering sail ami
i proved of great advantage in a day so

i The preparatory gun was fired at 10:45.
j'At that time both yachts were on the
port tack, standing to the southward,
I with the Shamrock in the lead and the
I Columbia following in her wake. Ten
minutes later the bang of the warning
gun was heard and' the' Columbia, wear
ing sharply round, 1 trimmed her sails- on
the other tack, the Shamrock crossing her
bows.'- The Columbia took good care, to
secure the weather .berth, and ten seconds
after the starting gun, which was fired at
the dot of 11, she crossed the 'line- on the
starboard tack, ahead and well to wind
ward. The Shamrock luffed over the line
a few- seconds before the gun fired. and
was recalled by the judges' boat and had

A JEW YORK, Oct. I. Always optimistic, Sir Thomas Upton to-day, after the race, was in
1 V the best of spirits. He said:
?/ really don't see anything yet on which to base a definite opinion regarding the two
boats. While the Shamrock was leading when the race was called off, there's nothing to brag
about To-day while the winds were very light, there was little Unking, therein differing from last
Thursday's breezes, which, in spots, failed utterly, each boat in turn striking dead calms. After the
shozvino made thus far by both boats, I should not hesitate if I were a betting man to lay even money
on the Shamrock. Both "boats were handled to-day to the best ability by the best men each coun
try could produce. I don't think there's a better skipper in America than Captain Barr of the Co
lumbia."
Sir Thomas expressed himself as personally in favor of racing every day, provided any sug
gestion looking to that end should be made.
Captain Bob Wringe/who stands by Sir Thomas on the bridge, when asked if he considered
Shamrock's chances better, said:
"I can't say that her chances are better, for they were never bad."

Among the prominent speakers who will
take part in the convention is Right Rev.
Isaac I>>a Nicholson, Bishop of Milwau
kee, who is another of those prelates of
his church who sympathize with the rit
ualistic movement and was one of the
s< ven who participated in the noted Fond
du Lac consecration. He is a native of
Baltimore and began life as a banker.
Entering Dartmouth, he became the cen
ter of un association of students, among
whom were Bishops Leonard and Talbot,
and by whom he was influenced to take
Episcopal orders. He studied at the Vir
ginia Theological Seminary and was
made priest in 1S72. Subsequently called
to the rectorship of old St. Mark's. Phila
delphia, he developed into a priest of the
highest ability. Chosen to the diocese of
Wisconsin, he has extended the church
and its institutions to a wide extent.
Thrice divided, at another convention an
additional diocese will be created.
Bishop Nicholson is a firm advocate of
the church as a vita!, living reality. He
will follow in the footsteps of Bishops
Grsfton and Seymour, the high church
etiamjjions.

The great question of ritualism in the
church and the stand which may be taken
on the subject by the convention Is ab
sorbing the attention of the laity and
clergy throughout the country. One of
the most famous advocates of advanced

Franklin Seymour, Bishop of Springfield,
in the province of Illinois.
Bishop Seymour by birth Is a New

Church in th!s city, but declined. H's
high church views cost him the election
to the episcopate of Missouri by a vote of

He- was elected Bishop of Illinois, but
the house of deputies refused to confirm
In 1S77 he was unanimously elected Bish

and accepted. He was consecrated in
Trinity Church, N>w York, to the sorrow
of the low church element, who were
pure that the church would become
Roman right away. In this they were
disappointed. Dr. Seymour is a great

In 1S95 the firm of Drexel, Morgan & Co.
became J. P. Morgan & Co., which is J.
Pierpont Morgan and eleven others who*.,
he has associated with him, not for their
financial strength, but for their assistance
as lieutenants in handling the vast
amount of business that has been drawn
to the house, which now, though a private
concern. Is one of the most powerful
financial factors in the business of the
world.
Mr. Morgan's father died in 1S90, leav
ing him a fortune of some $10,000,000 and
the sole control of the London house of
J. S. Morgan & Co. and the Paris house
of Morgan, Harjes & Co., with all their
worldwide connections.
From the outset of his career Mr. Mor
gan paid especial attention to the "foreign
exchange" department of the banking
business, and having in time thoroughly
mastered it was in a position of advant
age in securing a large share of the
enormous business in that line necessi
tated by our large and ever growing im
port and export trade.
In 1S60 John Pierpont Morgan became
the American agent for George Peabody
& Co., London; four years later he organ
ized the firm of Dabney, Morgan & Co.,
and in 1871 became connected with the
wealthy Drexels of Philadelphia In the
firm of Drexel, Morgan & Co.
Joseph Morgan, Mr. Morgan's grand
father, took part in the Revolution. As a
farmer and tavern-keeper at Hartford he
amassed what was then counted a good
fortune. His lands occupied a large part
of Asylum Hill and In time became quite
valuable. This property was left to his
son Junius, John Pierpont Morgan's
father, who by energy and natural apti
tude for business, first as a dry goods
merchant and then as the associate of
George Peabody, the great banker, mul
tiplied it into millions and laid part of the
foundation for the vast fortune that has
been gathered by his son.
John Pierpont Morgan was born in
Hartford, Conn., where he attended school
until he was 14, when his father moved
to Boston. There he became a student at
the celebrated Knglish High School and
on his graduation therefrom at the age
of 18 spent two years at the University
of Gottingen, Germany. ...
At the age of 21 he entered the banking
house of Duncan, Sherman & Co., New
York.
On his father's side his family dates
back to 1636, when Miles Morgan, the
first of the line on this side of the water,
landed on New England soil and with a
few others founded the town of Spring
field, Mass.
Mr. Morgan isaNewEnglander by birth
and ancestry. His mother, from whom he
gets his middle name, was Miss Juliet,
daughter of .the Rev. John Pierpont, the
author of the stirring little poem on the
appeal supposed to have been made by
Avarren to nismenatthe battle of Bunker
Hill, which begins "Stand! The ground's
your own, my braves.' Mr. Morgan inher
ited something of his grandfather's poet
ical nature, and in his youth did several
things in verse, to which, however, he
does not claim- to owe much of his pres
ent fame.
It Is the same In the vestry meetings at
St. George's, where Mr. Morgan is senior
warden of the church, and where as such
he can be seen at the Sunday service
passing' the plate for offerings of the con
gregation, always adding a comparatively
liberal contribution, if not the scriptur
ally enjoined tithe.
With his pastor, Rev. W. S. Rainsford,
who came to St. George's in 1881, when
quite a young man, Mr. Morgan has al
ways been on the most intimate terms
and given him the most hearty support
and co-operation in his work for the tem
poral and spiritual betterment of. the peo
ple within reach.
Besides a, new parish house for St.
George's, which Mr. Morgan erected at
a cost of Â¥300,000, the New York Trade
School, which he established at a cost of
$500,000; the new Lying-in Hospital, to
which he gave $1,350,000; the Loomis Con
sumption Hospital, rome $500,000, aÂ«d
$500,000 to the Young Men's Christian As
sociation, $1,000,000 to Harvard University,
$125,000 for the preservation of the Pali
sades of the Hudson, $100,000 to a library
for Holyoke, Mass., where his father was
born, and other gifts too numerous for
special mention, Mr. Morgan gives each
year considerably over $100,000 to the reg
ular church work and individual charities
of New York and the vicinity.
Inherits a Practical Nature.
period of twenty-one years, he has been in
his place as delegate and performed most
valuable service on the committees to
which he has been appointed.
Always a regular attendant at the ses
sions of the convention, an attentive lis
tener and taking a keen interest in the
proceedings, yet his voice is seldom heard
on the floor. When it is, whether speak
ing to the question or making a commit
tee report, there is never any doubt as to
his meaning.
Never taning upon himself the proper
duty. of the others, his purse ever opens
to supplement their efforts, or to bridge
over un emergency when the need comes.
Yet, with it all, in this one field of ac
tion Mr. Morgan performs his duty and
pleasure (for such duty is to him) without
seeking to dominate, as perforce of cir
cumstnnce and surroundings he does in
the business world.

and continue during the convention.
Creation of New Diocese.
The utmost interest in the proceedings
of the general convention centers in the
subject of the creation of new dioceses
and divisions of the old. The -church is
growing by leaps and bounds, and more
and more the ilmlt of endurance of the
Bishops is reached. The only relief that
is regarded as practicable is by the mul
tiplication of O.ioceses. Coadjutor Bish
ops, except in cases where the Bishop is
disabled on account of age or physical
infirmity, are not regarded as a desirable
alternative. The danger of a conflict of
authority is ever present. The remedy
seems to be in the creation of new dio
ceses. Massachusetts will be one of the
dioceses that will he cut in half, and the
new diocese of Western Massachusetts
will come into being well equipped in
every respect. The churchmen of Boston
have raised $l:X),000 as an endowment of
the new diocese, which will embrace the
larger portions of the territory of the old
Bay State, but not numerically In the
number of communicants or clergy. West
ern Massachusetts being an independent
jurisdiction will elect its own Bishop as
soon as the consent of the church to the
measure is gained.
The diocese of Olympia, embracing the
cities 6f Seattle and Tacoma, including
the prosperous region of Western Wash
ington and Puget Sound, has sent a strong
delegation to secure an independent or
ganization. It is promised to raise $30,000
in six years as an endowment. The Bish
ops are loth to accept promises to pay.
If Olympia churchmen had raised $20,000
in cash the consent of the church to its
independent organization would have been
assured. Olympia must consent to remain
a missionary jurisdiction for the present.
The utmost consideration will be given
to the subject of provisional Bishops for
the Philippines. Porto Rico and Cuba. If
the church is to find a place for itself in
the new possessions a Bishop for each is
an absolute necessity. The question will
be quickly decided in the affirmative if
the means of support can bo assured.
The care of the church in Hawaii can
be settled in but one way â by the resig
nation of Bishop Willis. He cannot be
superseded. If the" present Bishop will
step down and out the American church
will soon settle the auestion.
The convention therefore lias the ap
pointment oj! several new Bishops on ita
hands: North Dakota, to succeed Bishop
Edsall. transferred to Minnesota; Olym
\u25a0pia, as successor to Bishop Parker; Porto
Rico. Cuba and the Philippines, besides
Hawaii.
Whether or not Bishop Rowe will con
tinue in Alaska depends .upon his support.
J. Pierpont Morgan guaranteed the Bish
op's salary for the first three years. If
he continues this benefaction the church
in Alaska will retain its present hard
worked and devoted head. Upon whom
the choice for Bishops will be placed agi
tates many of the younger element of the
clergy.
Programme for To-Day.
The opening service of the General Con
vention will take place this morning at 11
at Trinity Church. Bush and Gough
streets. The service will be participated
In by all the Bishops and the clerical arid
lay delegates to the convention. It will
consist of the holy communion office, and
the sermon will be preached by the Right
Rev. the Bishop of Oregon, B. Wistar
Morris.
At 3 this afternoon the House of Bish
ops and the House of Delegates will con
vene and organize for business. The
Bishops will meet in executive session,
while the House of Deputies will be called
to order by the Rev. Charles Hutchings,
secretary of the house. After the roll has
been called and the credentials of the
delegates have been presented the house
will proceed to elect a chairman. In the
absence of the Rev. Morgan Dlx of New
York City, who is unable to be present,
there will be many candidates for the
honor of presiding over the deliberations
of the house.
West, which contain the tribes, and the
progress that has been made among these
aborigines is one of the boasts of the
church.

Catarrh
Ends in
Death
It's a long, miserable, painful and
desperate road from a cold in the head
to death by consumption â the result of
catarrh. Do. not think because you
are coughing, gurgling, choking and
raising decayed matter from the throat
and nasal passages, you have reached
the end of your catarrhal troublesâ you
have notâthe worst is yet to come â
you have untold suffering before you â
not only suffering for you, but misery
and exasperation for your friends and
family.
Don't wait until it is too late â get a
bottle of.Halpruner's Wonderful Medi-
cine and cure your catarrh at once.
Halpruner's is a very effective, quick-
ly curing medicine â one that will purify
your blood, give vigor to your mus-
cles and membranes and set the \ ma-
chinery of your body in proper action
to give you the best of good health.
Nearly all druggists sell Halpruner's
âa few will try to. talk you out of buy-
ing it; they want to sell you some-
thing elseâ something they make in
their cellars which doesn't cost any-
thing but the price of the bottles
something that is made to sellâ not to
cure.

If you can't get It from your druggist '
telephone to Bush 4C3, or call at Halpruner

mind that you are to salute with the
hand that is opposite to the person you
wish to greet. Thus, if he is to pass you
on your , left, you use the right hand,
and if he .passes you on your right you
must employ the left hand.
It consists ofthese three simple move
ments: .First, when the person is about;
seven paces away: you throw either the
right or the left arm. as the case may. be,
easily and gracefully up in front of you.;
so the upper arm is perpendicular to the
body and the forearm is obliquely across
the body, so that the. fingers touch the
rim of your hat near the front and center
of the face;, the hand is open, the â¢palm
being nearest the face, and the. J fingers
are close together and slightly bent., with
the thumb hidden by being in front of
the .first finger and nearest, the . face.
Second, you incline s.lightly and remove
your hand about four Inches in front of
your face. Third,, when the person, has
passed you, you straighten up and thro-*
your arm smartly at the side. You may
then continue your walk, possessed of
the gratified feeling" , of \u25a0 having been
strictly "in the mode," and of having
greeted your friend with : a < natural,
graceful, salute. . ,

RI6HT TO BEAR ARMSâ CUizen, City.
The right to bear arms is guaranteed by
the constitution of the United States. That
has been construed to bear arms openly.
The laws or ordinances that prohibit the
carrying of weapons concealed has been
held not to be in conflict with that pro
vision of . tha constitution. The law
against carrying weapons concealed Is
based on the theory that a man who car
ries weapons concealed desires to take un-'
fair advantage of an antagonist or to
commit a cowardly assault. The law
granting permits to carry weapons con
cealed is based on the theory that those
to whom such permits are issued are
law-abiding citizens, who carry arms for
self-protection only.

go to the rear as far as the elevation of

PERSONAL MENTION.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
YESTERDAY The Call had again to record an
affray caused by an assault upon a workingman
in the peaceable pursuit of his work. This time
*he assaulted man had not only a weapon, but the
courage to use it, and it was not he who suffered
most from the affray. The affair, however, is deplor
able. Here are two mere men seriously wounded as a
result of the attacks and assaults which are now becom
ing so frequent in the city. The controversy is clearly
approaching the inevitable climax, and if there be not
a vigorous enforcement of the law and an arrest of the
lawless we shall very soon have serious rioting, in
which many lives will be lost.
The men who are now seeking to terrorize the peace
able workingmen of the city are growing bolder and
are relying more and more constantly upon the sup
port given them by the Examiner and its allies. The
incitements to riot which that paper has been publish
ing increase in fierceness and in falseness. Over and
over again these mischief-making inciters to strife call
upon workingmen to resist the police and the law.
The effect of their appeals to the violent and the
lawless is only too apparent. We arc passing from
the period of assaults committed by scattered gangs
to dangerous affrays in which large numbers take
part. Lawlessness is clearly upon the verge of an
open outburst, and yet the yellow journal and its
special commissioners continue to vilify the police,
the city government, the merchants, and, in fact,
every law-abiding element of the community.
In one of the inflammatory articles published in the
Examiner of yesterday and written by one of its
special commissioners it was said: "There is a secret
body of wealthy men unknown to the constitution
and above the law who have full power over an armed
force of about 1289 men â a fair-sized army. * * *
This army holds the city. No man is safe., from it.
JBy night and day attacks are made upon peaceable
citizens; unoffending wayfarers are shot down in
the public streets. * * \u2666 Never did the tyrants
of Greece, never did the despots of the medieval
cities, never did the Czar of Russia dare to deal with
their subjects so."
Statements of that kind, wild and silly as they are,
have yet a potent influence when addressed to men
already inflamed against the law and ready to strike
at any point where they believe there is a chance to
inflict an injury without getting hurt themselves. The
appeals may not be deliberately designed as incite
ments to riot, but they unquestionably have- that ten
dency. They are poured out day after day as incen
tives to action on the part of all who are opposed
to the law, who are antagonistic to the police and
who would turn the city over to riot and pillage if
they dared to do it.
In the face of the repeated assaults and affrays the
supporters of the lawless elements have the effrontery
to assert that the city would be peaceable were it not
. for the police. . They declare that the city government
and the business men are responsible for all the blood
that has been shed in the numerous attacks that have
been made since the disturbances began. The object
of all these falsehoods and slanders is to hold the law
ful authorities of the municipality up to the scorn of
the violent and the vicious.
It was just such falsehoods directed by the Exam
iner day after day against McKinley that led to his
assassination. From equal causes there will follow
equal effects. We have had assaults and affrays. Are
we now to have assassinations and riots as a result of
the teaching of the Examiner and its allies?
To the Mayor as the chief magistrate of the city
the people look in this emergency. It devolves upon
him to protect the workingmfcn of the city from the
strikers who assail them, and to so strengthen the
police that the lawless cannot assail it .with impunity.
HASTENING TO THE END.
THE automobile writes its autograph on the faces of Its
devotees just as legibly as football, six-day cycle
contests, golf, a lunatic asylum or the Eastern peni
tentiary, says the North American. Football, it Is well
known, brings about a facial resemblance to a bat-eared bull
dog; cycle contests mark the face with deep lines and give the
eyes a tendency to pop out. Golf gives the face a right to
left inclination. The automobile face, in its first stages, is one
in which fear that the thing will break down is mingled with
apprehension that there will be a collision at any moment.
There is a tremulous, uncertain pursing of the lips j and an
anxious look in the eyes. In the racing, or incurable stage,
there is little of the face left.
On the head Is a cap such as Dutch students â¢wear, horse
blinkers with glass at the eyeholes cover the upper part of the
countenance, and a close fitting hood encircles the ears. cheek3
and neck. For the very worst of the species there are nose
and mouth fenders, to make breathing possible when soing
sixty miles an hour.
THE AUTOMOBILE FACE. AS SHOWN IN THE ILLUSTRATION, IS BY NO MEANS A THING OF BEAUTY. IT
IS THE FACE ONE SEES WHEN THE CHAUFFEUR, GOING AT GREAT SPEED. FEARS A BREAKDOWN
OR A COLLISION. -

After recalling Hearst's statement that "bar one" McKinley "is the most despised
and hated creature in the hemisphere, his name is hooted at, his figure burned in effigy,"
the New York Sun says for the American people: "They remember and they do not for
give Mr. Hearst. All over the country there is a bitter feeling against him. It is use
less for him to put an onion to his eyes and boohoo. He now occupies the place which
he assigned to that gentle and generous statesman whom he loved to slander. The de
scription needs but one slight modification. 'Bar none' Hearst is now 'the most de
spised and hated creature in the hemisphere. His name is hooted at/his figure burned.'
And what an incalculable public misfortune it would be if this were not so."
The Jersey City News says: "The crime of Hearst is not the censure of McKin
ley. We believe the Jersey City News has spoken of the President on innumerable occa
sions in terms of severity. * * * The difference is that the New York Journal ap
peals to the knife, the pistol and the bomb for,remedy. Our appeal is to public opinion,
to public discussion and to the ballot. While we endeavor to rally the people in the
names of Jefferson, Jackson and Cleveland, the Hearst organs hold up Jack Cade, Marat
and Robespierre as heroes and exemplars for patriotism. These papers have repeatedly
dared glorify the excesses of the French Revolution and have, printed articles in direct,
open praise of assassination, with plain intimation that it was applicable to the evils of
our own da}'. No,} it will not do for Mr. Hearst to try to evade his responsibility. He
is a preacher of riot, loot and assassination. John Most has never gone further. Let
the people see him as he is and judge him and his papers."
The Perth Amboy Republican says: "Mr. Hearst deliberately makes his great
newspapers vehicles of falsehood, agents of destruction. He is like a quack who offers
some deadly opiate as a panacea for all namable diseases, well knowing that the drug
will paralyze the mind and the will and inevitably create in its victim a demand for more.
When Czolgosz comes to the electric chair let it. not be forgotten that the real culprit is
not the unbalanced, weak degenerate who held the pistol, but William R. Hearst, of
whose teachings the -act was the legitimate outcome."
Referring to Hearst's style of journalism the New Haven Leader says: "The de
mand for the suppression of this pernicious influence is universal. Relentlessly, inde
cently, outrageously, the yellow journals have denounced every man in public life and
have sought to increase circulation by the crudest and most indecent cartoons, supple
mented by red ink headlines, editorial vituperation and persistent, constant effort to ar
ray-mass against class and arouse the worst passions of mankind. The time has come
when this kind of journalism can no longer be safely tolerated, when the good name of
this nation demands that such debauchery of public principle be stopped and stopped
forever."
Dealing with the Examiner's reply to* the indignation of the people the Amador
Ledger says: "Its only.^defense is that it is 'the paper of the people.' What people? Its
columns show only too clearly the kind of people it^io the mouthpiece for â the Mosts,
Czolgoszes, and anarchists generally. Its villainous system of cartooning and vilification
has done more to weaken the respect for law and good government than the ravings of
a score of out and out anarchist . lecturers. And its' conduct at this crisisâ when the mal
edictions of the American people against journals of its stripe are being heard on every
hand â only deepen the public contempt." \ ,-\u25a0'â¢â¢
The Ukiah Republican.-Press says: "Looking tack over the history of the past
seven or eight years, the fact stands out prominently that the yellow newspapers have
been fanning the spirit of anarchy. Their business is to sell newspapers. by methods of
sensationalism and playing upon the basest passions of mankind. They receive as news a
simple fact and proceed to surround it with a mass of glaring fiction and startling sur
mises. They represent the idea that the Government and -social system are diseased to
the core." , ." ' . . 'V- -
The LOS Angeles Times says: "The widespread movement which has been begun
by the decent and sdf-respecting portion of the American people against the slimy and
traitorous sheets. published by that pervert and degenerate, W. R. Hearst, is a righteous
movement. It had its origin in the horror and reprobation which every/ American heart
feels because of the act of the assassin Czolgosz, and because of the vile and venomous
influences which have-been permitted to work their ends, culminating in the most atro
cious crime which has been committed in the history of the republic."
The Arcata Union in commenting upon the claim of the Examiner. that it is "an
American newspaper for the American people"' says: "That paper taught that McKin
ley was a menace to human liberty, and the pitiful assassin believed he was carrying out
the will of the people when he took his life. But now the insincerity, and dishonesty
of this yellow sheet- become apparent.'. Immediately after his death whole pages are
taken up in. praise of McKinley. He is placed- upon a pinnacle beside Washington and
Lincoln and lauded to the skies as the foremost statesman of trie age.. * * * The
'she fiend' Goldman, who incited the crime; is at least consistent and defies public opin
ion by expressing her, utter indifference to the dastardly act. Czolgosz glories in his act
and welcomes, death, believing that he carried out the teachings of Goldman and the
The MarySVille Appeal says: "The public has a short memory as a rule, and in
time the Examiner may win its way back to favor to ? an abbreviated extent. But it is
losing heavily all round just now, and iHs to be hoped that the good work will con
tinue until the 'Anarchearsts' have been taught such a lesson that they will never a^ain
fly in the face of public decency." / T
The New York Press says of Hearst's reply to his critics: "And so having put in
your defense 'human,' .animated,' 'entertainhig,' 'light word,' 'funny,' you are goin<* to
resume the. humanity; the animation, the entertainment, the lightness and the fun. For
you do not propose that the mere assassination of the President by one of your disciples
shall make of your merry journalistic life a gloomy graveyard. Assassins may people
our graveyards with public men, murderers may hasten our Presidents to the tomb an
archists may play at -bowls with the skulls of our chosen servants, but yellow journalism
will not cease its 'human' incendiarism, its 'animated' .license, its /entertaining' incitement
its 'light' crime breeding, its 'funny' anarchism. Now. that the funeral is over you will
resume. But you willjnpt. * * * You will not resume if "the American people re-
Such is the general tone of the comment with; which Hearst's defense published
in his three papers has been met. The voice of the press of the East and of the West
attests the fact that the condemnation of the yellow 'journals was not a mere spasm of
wrath which would pass away as Hearst supposed in a few days. On the contrary, that
indignation is the outcome of long years of disgust with Hearst journalism, but which
found no adequate expression for itself until .the assassination of- McKinley roused the
whole people to vehement denunciations of the common enemy of law, society, religion
and government. ' ";^ _"' \u25a0;. ':Â£Â£Â£ --^V ;.":.. ;f.; : : : '* ; .. - ; ' " / \u25a0 ' -
The Coming (N. Y.) Journal says: "The yellow journals which have for years ven :
omously vilified and cartooned President McKinley are . now seeking to escape public
wrath by praising him. They have done their best to inflame the public mind against
him, and have really incited his murder. To arrest a contemptible cur like Johann Most,
a New York anarchistic editor, and allow immunity to William R. Hearst, the proprie
tor of the New York Journal, Chicago American and San Francisco Examiner/ is an ab- 1
surdrty. The assassination of the President is one of the direct fruits of .the anarchistic
teachings of Hearst's vile trjo of yellows."
. ThejChicago Journal says: "That some great evil or calamity must follow the in
cendiary journalism ; of W. R. Hearst was always obvious.. What would be the character
of the blow, or upon whom it would fall, could only be a matter of conjecture, and no one
even dreamed that the late President who so clearly possessed the affections of the
people could become a victim. And yet in the retrospect of the course Mr. Hearst has
pursued with his three papers it now seems logical enough that President McKinley
should be the bright and shining mark for hatred and discontent, for malice and'anarchy
W Y EARST'S defense of himself has now -been' before" the American people long

"*\u25a0 \u25a0"\u25a0 dignation against his lying journals and increase public disgust .with his shame

utterances, of the press of all sections of the Union denouncing yellow journalism and,
its "crocodile tears/'-

THE following deadly editorial appeared in
Hearst's New York Evening Journal on
May 22, 1 901 , less than six months be-
fore President McKinley was shot down
by a pupil of yellow, journalism:
"What is an anarchist?"
"According to accepted definitions, issued
by the higher classes of society, an anarch-
ist is one who tries to do something useful
that has never been done before.
"There is a change coming some day,
whether the gentlemen who denounce char-
ity as anarchy want the change or not."
WHAT IS AN ANARCHIST?
IN connection with the recent assassina-
tion of President McKinley will the Exam-
iner please teil what it meant when on
Februarys 1900s it published, from its
Washington correspondent, the following:
"The bullet that pierced Goebei's chest
Cannot be found in all the West;
Good reason. It is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier."

The records of this board will disclose that
Professor Lyser has repeatedly preferred
charges asrainst some of the oldest and most
experienced, teachers In the department, which
upon trial have not been sustained.
George O. Mitchell, the teacher in the
Girls' High School, who was cited to ex
plain.why he had not paid a $300 tailor bill,
appeared and promised the board that he
would settle the bill at once. He thus
escapes suspension under the rule impos
ing that penalty on teachers who do not
pay their just debts. \u25a0'
Attorney S. V. Costello filed a petition
signed by the parents"of all the pupils in
the John Swett School under the tuition
of Miss Mary C. McKinney, against whom
charges have been preferred by Principal
Albert Lyser. The parents certify that
they are entirely satisfied with the
progress made by their children and re
quest that Miss McKinney be retained in
her position.
In answer to Lyser' s charge that the
mind of Miss McKinney is in such an ab
normal condition as to make it impossible
for her to' sustain amicable relations with
the other teachers, Costello says that Mrs.
J. H. Erikson is the only teacher with
whom Miss McKinney is not friendly.
He adds that there are eighteen teachers
in the school. Coatello pays:
The first appointments from the new
eligible list of teachers were made yester
day by the Board of Education, which
elected Miss Elizabeth B. Moore and Miss
Cecilia H. Gilchrist to succeed Miss Helen

Among the passengers on the Han

came here as a stowaway. As he had no
money and no means of support the Gov

One of the transport's crew was Robert
Arthur Maeondray. He shipped as a deck
hand a few hours before the vessel sailed
and is now qualifying as an A. B. It is
only a year ago since young Maeondray
was married to Miss Madge Richardson
in this city. Their honeymoon was spent
in Japan and the young couple had a
splendid time. Four months ago Mrs.
Maeondray sued for and obtained a di

STANFORD I'NIVERSITY, Oct. 1.â
The students and faculty gathered In the
assembly hall to-night to take part in the
exercises in commemoration of the open
ing of the university ten years ago. On
October 1, 1S91. Stanford University was
formally opened to students for the first
college year. Senator Stanford, President
Jordan. Martin Kellogg and others ad
dressing the meeting^ which was held in !
what is now known as the inner quad- I
rangle.
The Drayer to-night was offered, as it ;
was ten years ago. by Rev. Robert i
Mackenzie. The same sonps were sun? ;
and Scriptures read as at the opening
exercises in 1891; in fact the programme
\u25a0w;as made to conform a? nearly as pos
sible to that rendered at the dedication of
the university.
President Jordan said in part:
Ten year* a*ro to-day the students and fac
ulty of Lel&nd Stanford Jr. University met
to Inaugurate a new center of higher educa
tion In California. There was m^ney and
hope, flowers and sunshine, ifc.. glories of
nature and the glories of" architecture. The
one question na*. Shall we have students?
The population of the coast was scanty, less
all told than that of the city of Chicago. It
had already an honored university and no
visible place for more.
The New York Mall and Express notified
ue that there was as much room for a new
university in California as for an asylum for
brokendown sea captains in Switzerland, and j
the professor? were told that for years they j
roust "lecture in marble halls to empty :
benches." If indeed there should be any need I
oX benches in thete hails, in which they would '
'erve only to disfigure the architecture. The j
first entrance examination offered little r.ore
Micouragement. It was held on the porch of
Ksccndite cottage. Three candidates were
jreeent, two mc-n who failed, and one woman, !
MIes Longley of Mountain View, who passedâ I
the first student admitted to Stanford. !
Lest we should provide a feast for those j
who would not come it was agreed to limit !
the faculty at the beginning to fifteen besides j
the president, the registrar, who also taught
economics, the librarian. Professor Woodruff,
who could also teach Jaw. and Hert Fesler, i
who taught the hipher law in Encina Hall, j
After these there was a wa!t;nÂ«c list .^f as
sistants who oou'd come it" wanted. U,?Fides |

About a hundred received advanced standing. .
The reft formed the famous pioneer olas:;. th-i â¢
class cf 1SSE. the class which already rprr.inds
us that there were giants in those days wh?n
the world and the university were yountr.
And with thÂ» presence ...f the students Â«e
found our just reason for Wing. Th- work
began in serious, hopetul earnestness. It Is
going on' to-day, and it will go on. we be
lieve, so long as civilization shall endvre.
Oxford, founded by Alfred the threat, has a
thousand years the start, but this dees net
discourage us. for we have kej.t up with it.
The new university rides en the shoulders of
the old and the lessons of tho thcusar.il vcars
belorg to us Just p.s much as to old Oxford.
One lesson of these ten years is ours and
ours alon*. It is the leÂ«son of faith and
fidelity; faith in the future undÂ»r Ood'Â« \:?l\>, ,
and fidelity to a trust under the most dis
fiuraging conditions.
There is BOt one of us who realizes thp tre
trer.flous nature df the obstacles encou-urred
by the university in the yt-ars from ISJI to :
T'S6. the years of financial panic, of wanton
liiigaticn. the times of depression and <!if- :
tress, which descended like a prison Rate on
en institution prepared only far h;ifÂ«e and i>ro- |

rave th*- Institution, the unswerving devotion
dt the sur^ivir.ff fourder. To doubt rr falti-r
was to r^rish. and in th* most trying times
no such words cere found in her vc.-abuiRry.
To her there must always l*e a way. The
pood Lord would provide it. And always tljÂ«

'tiuriders and the help of him who doeth all
things well, these doors shall never be closed
so Song as one stone shall remain ui>on an

| A DAMAGED PR05TATE I
|] As a Factor in So=CaIled "Weakness" I
1 Cannot Be Too Highly Emphasized. I
Q Assuming that the functions of the Prostate Gland, so-called neck of the |
M bladder, are understood, it should be apparent that when damaged through |
|| lorg continued and too often repeated excitement or contracted diseases, that P
ta 3isordered function must result. The first symptoms pointing to this pros- I
B tatic disorder are referable to the reproductive system. It is first noticed |
f| that patients suffering from this disease are embarrassed by Prematureness. I
fj This is invariably followed, sooner orvlater, by loss of vitality and power, H
Â£â¢1 together with all those symptoms known as "Weakness." The most common H
H form of damage to the gland is congestion, of more or less severity, which B
|i finally becomes* localized as prostatic catarrh, and if this catarrh once be- H
Q comes chronic, then various nervous symptoms arise, which are known to B
fl t'hyslclans as Neurasthenia, or exhausted nerve force. The greater number E
rj of patients suffering from this so-called weakness are healthy and robust B
g men in every other respect, men who. possibly; have been treated by tonics, g
H electricity, etc., for a weakness which, if the above has been made clear, will \u25a0
Â§j be understood never to have existed. Some years ago we called the attention H
E of the medical profession and others to the fact that the above well defined m
E symptoms were not weaknesses, but results of inflammation, and that drugs Â§2
I could not cure, but procedures directed toward repairing the damage, always m
I proved successful, was known as the "Talcott Theory." A recent number of n
R the Medical News pays us a pretty compliment In saying, "It la no longer H
r a theory, but a fact," and the profession have now adopted the Talcott I
I Prostatic Dilator and Urethal Suppository Depositor as a necessity in the H

I Varicocele is an enlargement of the most vital blood vessels in man. In |
B their normal condition their function is to carry off waste material, thus B
I enabling the organs to receive fresh nutrition. Owing to the breaking down B
I of the valves, caused by the paralysis of the muscular coat of the veins, they H

NEW YORK. Oct. 1.â The lively interest in
to-day's International yacht race took many
Stock Exchange members away from the board
room and still further diminished the volume
of trading. The day's aggregate sales were
barely 300,000 shares, and the fluctuation of
prices was .very narrow for the most part:
The exceptions worthy of special note were
in the industrial list and among the dormant
and less important railroad stocks. Liquida
tion in Sugar was the feature of the market,
following a sharp break in prices yesterday.
The usual lack of information regarding the
movement was one of its features. The room
traders joined in the selling in an attempt to
make a quick return -and their covering
caused a rally of a point. The stock's ex
treme decline was 4>,i. The gossip to account
lor the decline included rumors that the in
siders were liquidating on apprehension of a
change in the sugar tariH at the coming- ses
sion of Congress or of unfriendly, legislation.
Other rumors had it that Insiders who had
sold at recent high prices were depressing
the price to get back their stock. The gen
eral ieeling or distrust of the blind pool meth
ods of the great industrial corporations, which
liad reached an acute stage since the recent
episode In Amalgamated Copper, was a factor
In Sugar and in a number of other Industrials
There were declines of lVi@2 points in Brook
lyn Transit. Colorado Fuel, National Salt pre
ferred. General Electric and American Ex
presa. The waiting attitude of the market
was partly due to expectations of dividend
action on the United .States Steel stocks and
the presentation of a promised financial state
ment. The non-appearance of this as the' 'ses
sion drew toward its close emphasized the
weakness of the industrials. Amalgamated
Copper was rather firm, rising a point, then
losing It and then stiffening to the bÂ»>st
Aichison was quite notably firm and gained
a point on rumors that the directors would
increase the semi-annual dividend rate to 2
per cent at a meeting to-morrow. There were
other Hrm spots in the railroad list and the
funeral undertone was rather firm on a be
lated recognition of yesterdays important re
cuperation of the money market resources bv
receipts of Australian and French gold The
aCt !Â° n of the market was hesitating and un
certain throughout.
The railroad bond market was dull and !-
regular. Total sales, $l,400,CC0

The Weather and Crops.
The repcrt of A. G. McAdie, section director
of the climate and crop service of the weather
bureau, for the week ending Monday is as
follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been considerably be
low normal in all sections during the week,
but the weather has been generally pleasant
and favorable for fruit drying and late crops.
Light rain has fallen throughout the State,
and there v.as quite a heavy fall of snow in
the mountains east of Fresno on the 23d.
Grain thrashing and hay bailing are still
progressing in many places. Reports received
at this office do not show any considerable
damage to grain and hay by the rain of last
\u25a0vveck, although exposed grain in sacks and
unbaled hay in some sections were slightly
Injured. There are no reports of serious dam
age to beans and hops. Bean harvest Is pro
gressing favorably, with good results thus far.
Hops are all gathered and baling is nearly
completed; the yield and quality are about
average. Sugar beets are yielding more than
an average crop in some sections. Late veg
etables and pasturage were greatly benefited
by the rains.
Raisin making and fruit drying are pro
gressing rapidly, though temporarily delayed
by the rain on Tunday. As ample warnings
had been given, fruit trays were generally
stacked and but little damage resulted from
the rain. In some of the northern vineyards
there was some damage to grapes, which had
commenced cracking badly. Walnut picking
bad commenced. Citrus fruits are In excel
lent condition.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Cool, clear
weather continued after the rain of last Mon
day, followed by light showers Sunday. The
cool weather was bc-neficial to grapes, which
have not, fo far as reports indicate, been
seriously injured by the rains. There are
no reports of damage to grain and hay. and
it is not probable that the light ra!n of yes
terday injured these crops. Pasturage and
late vegetables were considerably benefited by
the rains, and in pome places the soil was
Foftened sufficiently for seeding summer-fal
low. Hops are all fathered and baling is
nearly complttfd in Yuba County. Oranges
are in excellent condition. The Sacramento
River rose one foot at Hed Bluff as a result
cf the ram last Monday.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.-The rain of
last week caused considerable damage to
grapes, grain and hay in some of the north
ern counties, but crops were not materlally
injured in the central and southern <*>unties
At Peachlar.d the rainfall up to the ">6ih wai :
1.2S Ir.ches, and grapes were cracking badlv
Dried fruits and ralsir.? were mostly under
cover before the rain. GraiÂ«? picking is pro
presEin*: rapidly. Exceptionally fine apules
are being marketed in Humboldt County and
the yield Is abundant in all the northern dis
tricts. Prunes and crapes are light crops in
the vicinity of Califtoga, but prunes are of
large size. Hop picking is completed in So
noma County. Beans and susar beets are
yielding eood crops. Gr^Jn thrashing and hav
baling will not be completed for several week's
in San Benlto County.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.â Light rain fell
penerally over the valley Sunday night and
Monday, but the danuge to drying fruit was
very light. As ample warnings had been
Kiven nearly all of the raisins on the trays
had been stacked and the grain was in the
varehouses. " The remaining portion of the
we^k was cool and somewhat unsettled, preatly
retarding raisin drying. A large portion of
the flrst crop is ready for the sweat boxes.
A gTeat many grapes are going to the wineries.
Teach and prune orops are about all har
vested. The sweet potato crop is being- har
vested. Imports from the mountain region
east of Fresno show that three or four inches
of snow fell on Monday, which retarded lum
bering. In 6ome portions of the valley plow
ing and seeding grain are progressing. Feed
anl water are plentiful and stock. of all kinds
are dclnff well.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Cooler weather
has prevailed during the v.eek, with heavy
fops along the coast Grain thrashing and
hay baling are not yet completed, but pro
gressing; rapidly. The hay crop is above aver
age in some sections. Barley is heavy, but
of poor quality. Bean harvest is progressing.
The sugar beet crcp is heavier than usual.
Corn le about average. There is a heavy crop
of tomatoes, excellent in quality. Potatoes
are looking well. Walnut picking is progress
ins. Citrus fruits are In excellent condition
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Cool, foggy
weather continues. Fruit drying is retarded;
conÂ«j damage. Almond harvest continues ;
fomewhat delayed. Favorable reports of citrus

acres of corn land to wheat, and that it would
not be surprising if the wheat crop of that
section equals the corn crop next year. There
will be about 6,000,000 acres of each.

CHICAGO, Oct. 1.â The last hour of the
wheat market, brought the bear contingent
out in force and with little effort they suc
ceeded in hammering the prices severely. De
cember opened %@V4c lower at 70%c to 70@
70%c and sagged a bit lower during the suc
ceeding hour. Covering brought December
back to 70%@70%c later, but the bears, seizing
upon the liberality of receipts as a pretext,
began selling and although their sales were
not large the market was so dull that the
effect on the price was marked. December
dropped to egHigcgUc and closed lc lower at
69%c, with no recuperative power left, to all
appearances.
Lacking any influential trading corn was
inclined to follow wheat. December closed
weak, %@%c lower, at 56%@56Uc. \
Oats had a short-lived activity about the
middle of . the session when weak longs be- j
came scared at liberal offerings by a prom
inent operator. December closed weak, Yi'S%c
down at>34%c.
Provisions were easier all around en a
weaker hog market and liquidation. The out
side demand was slow and January pork
closed 12%c lower, lard a shade lower and
ribs 5c lower.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Th3 stock market to-day was Idle in the ex
treme, but closed cheerful on a rally in the
Copper stocks. Rio Tintos opened at 46,
dropped to 43 9-16 and then sharply rallied.
The dividend, due on Thursday, is expected
to be thirty shillings, against 'forty shillings.
Probably 35s could be paid, but the board of
directors Is quite likely to prefer to augment
the reserves.-- Anacondas opened at 7Â«4 and
closed at 7% on American buying. The Amer
ican department was neglected and dull until
New York came a strong buyer of Atchlson.
The close was firm with slight changes in
quotations. Nothing was done in the \u25a0 street
sava in United States Steel, which is still
supported by the Morgan Interests. Money
Is steady. The fortnightly decrease in cop
per stocks is 273 tons, in supplies 73 tons.

and the Sanchez expedition, will attempt
to unite or co-operate In a movement upon
La Hacha, where Colombia appears to
have about 2000 men under the leadership
of Ayema. It Is more conservatively
thought that "Venezuela will not assume
the aggressive. Both the Venezuelan and
Colombian governments show a tendency
to place at the head of their forces the
revolutionary leaders of the other coun
try. In \u25a0 order to give a color of political
revolution in contacts between their re
spective troops. \u25a0
The Venezuelan disaster of September
14 Is fully confirmed. Few prisoners were
taken. The retreating Venezuelans were
caught on both sides of a river with a
bridge broken and the Colombians over
whelmed them from three sides, scatter
ing the Venezuelans, who were ambushed
by the Indians.
Letters received here from Tachlra. are

"His opposition dates back to the time

ago, when Dr. Clinton's name came up
for renomination. I was then the secre
tary of Mayor Phelan. Father Yorke
demanded the defeat of Clinton for re
nomination as Supervisor as Phelan had
the convention well under control. The
Mayor refused as Dr. Clinton had been
a good Supervisor and he thought it was
due both to the man and the party to
allow things to take their regular and

The Mayor did not Interfere. I know-

modestly and went about his business
with the quiet yet determined manner
that has distinguished him in the past.
He stated In an Interview that he will
devote part of his time to the operation
of the road and the balance to executive
business. He will still retain his olllces
in the Union Trust building, but at cer
tain hours of the day he will use the
executive offices.
The first official act of Julius Krutt

Clodomir and Juan Castillo, the Colom

from 500 to 2000 men. It is rumored that
the forces under Castillo and Davilaa*

Numberless rumors are being indus

ing of all information from various
sources leads to the belief that the forces
of Davila, with five companions, succeeded
in reaching Fort San Carlos, thirty miles
north of Maracaibo, a Venezuelan base
and political prison, whence he asked that
reinforcements be sent to rescue his com
mand, reported to be in distress and in
danger from the Indians inhabiting Goa

cacique, Juan Dolores, are fighting on the

A leaflet sent to the legation by the Co
lombian Consul at Curacao gives details
of the. recent fight at Curasua, about fif
teen miles from Rlo.Hacha, on the Goa
jira Peninsula, and which probably is
identical with that referred to by Minis
ter Mendez in his dispatch to Dr. Silva
to-day. It shows that the victory over
the enemy was complete, the Colomb'ans
taking four batteries of artillery. Gatlin^
guns and a considerable amount of am
munition. General Echeverria, who led
a portion of the expedition, the represen
tative says, was killed, contrary to pre
vious advices, which said he had fallen
captive into the hands of the Colombians.
. WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao, Oct.
1, via Haitien cable.â Advices received
here by mall from Maracaibo under date
of September 2S says that Venezuela is
protecting the Goajira frontier by rein
forcements. An expedition composed of
about 1500 recruits from Lavela de Coro;
on the- Gulf of Coro and Merida, with
Vincente Sanchea in command, left here
to-day for some point near Goajira, whence
they will probably move Inland toward
the frontier. The foregoing covers the
facts in the case.
Some uncertainty exists in the minds cf
the officials of the legation as to whether
this victory over the Venezuelans Is iden
tical -with, that victory heretofore re
ported via Curacao, in the press dis
patches, or is the result of another fight.
Dr. Silva, the Minister, is Inclined to the
former opinion. Some stress is laid on
the statement that this invasion was
without a previous declaration of war on
Venezuela's part. This, Dr. Silva says,
shows the irregularity of the course the
latter country has taken. . Dr. Mendez,

WASHINGTON, Oct. I.â The following
cablegram was received at the Colombian
legation in this city to-night:
"BOGOTA, Oct. l.-Colombian Minister,
Washington: We have~obtalned a signal
victory over Venezuelan troops that in
vaded Goajira, under Venezuelan offi
cers, and under the Venezuelan flag,
without a previous declaration of war.

Hawkes said hl3 recollection was that
he and Heistand. by the terms of the
memorandum, were to have $40,000 of the
stock and that General Corbin, George D.
Meiklejohn, Charles H. Allen, James E.
Boyd, W. W. Dudley and L. T. Michener
were to receive the remaining portions.
Only Heistand and Hawkes were present
when the apportionment was made.
Hawkes added that no testimony he
should give would connect Corbin, Meikle
john, Allen or Boyd personally with the
transaction.
Hawkes detailed a conversation with
Heistand in October, 1899, in which Hei
stand told him that Corbin and Allen had
withdrawn from the combination, and
that Meiklejohn had asked for the return
of Hawkes' letter of introduction. It was
given to Heistand. Hawkes said Heistand
suggested to him that he burn the re
mainder of the correspondence,. but he did
not accede to the proposition. . ..
During the day it was developed that
the telegram from General Otis relating
to sites for the hemp factory at Manila
was addressed to the Adjutant General. A
letter from Acting Secretary Sanger said
there was no record of a dispatch to Gen
eral Otis which called for the reply.
Major Hawkes told of a conversation
with General Corbin in relation to a set
tlement with Heistand for his services in
connection with the hemp company. He
said General Corbin told him the bill
ought to be paid and to make out his bill
and he (Corbin) would forward it through
military channels. General Corbin had
informed him . emphatically that ho was
not in the company and had nothing to do
with it. Hawkes said -he made out the
bill, but Corbin never forwarded it.
He also said that in an interview with
Assistant Secretary Allen the latter de
nied emphatically that he had any con
nection with the company. Hawkes said
he had numerous interviews with Assist
ant Secretary Meiklejohn, to whom he
had presented his claim through the
mails. Mr. Meiklejohn had said Heistand
ought to pay it. Mr. Meiklejohn, he said,
also appointed him in the customs service
In the Philippines and also promised him
promotion. Mr. Meiklejohn asked him for
recommendations before making the ap
pointment.
-Major Hawkes gave the details of his
trip to the Philippines and his return after
his appointment was revoked. He saw
Secretary Root, but the committee would
not permit him to tell anything of. what
passed between them, holding that Secre
tary Root was | not involved in the case.
Hawkes said he had interviews with Mr.
Meiklejohn In which - the latter told him
that it would be impossible for him to se
cure^ a position under the Government so
long as Mr. Root was Secretary of War.
' WASHINGTON, Oct. 1.â The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs to-day re
sumed its hearing of the charges against
Lieutenant Colonel H. 0. S. Hei%tand.
Major Hawkes, continuing his testimony,
asked that Colonel Heistand produce a
memorandum made in May, 1899, by the
colonel and himself, in which $150,000 of
the promoters' stock of the Manila Rope
Company was apportioned. Counsel for
Heistand said his client had no knowledge
of .such a document, but would search
for it.
A picturesque march, followed by equal
ly picturesque tableaux, was the leading
feature of â¢ the entertainment given in
the Native Sons' Hall last evening in the
Carnival of Ancient and Modern Arts.
When the festivities were at their height
the hall was a scene of remarkable bril
liancy. The costumes of many nations
were displayed by those who are taking
part In the carnival. The booths, attend
ed by handsomely gowned ladies and
stocked with articles of beauty and use,
were even handsomer than on the open
ing night. A large audience listened to
the music furnished by the band of the
Hebrew Orphan Asylum and enjoyed the
tableaux. In the grand march Uncle Sam
and Columbia were attended by Johnny
Bull, who was impersonated by Mr. Mur
ray.
It was English night, and the tableaux
were "Columbia at the Court of Spain,"
\u25a0which was presented by the ladles of the
Brozik booth, Mrs. R. E. White presi
dent; "Scene From the Mikado," by the
ladies of the Sir Arthur Sullivan booth,
Mrs. J. M. Dixon president, and a scene
from "The Termagant" by the ladles of
Mrs. Chester Keough's booth. The ladles
were assisted by gentlemen who volun
teered their services.
This evening the French will celebrate
and Mrs. M. A. Cachot, Mrs. Francis
Hunt and Mrs. Van der Nailen will have
charge of the tableaux.

Train Goes Through Bridge in Mex
ico and Two of Crew Are
Killed.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 1.â A dispatch from
Monterey, Mexico, says a freight train on
the Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad
went through a bridge near Lomo Alto.
Among the cars was one loaded with dy
namite. The concussion caused it to ex
plode, adding horror to the destructive
ness of the wreck. Two members of the
train crew were killed.
DYNAMITE-LADEIT CAB
EXPLODES IN A WBECK
the present strike was reported yesterday
to M. J. White, secretary of the Soclety
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
The case was that of the family of Ed
ward Campbell, longshoreman, and
member of the Longshoremen's Union, re
siding at 141 Main street.
Secretary White on investigation found
the mother and four little children living
in a wretched hovel in absolute want.
There was nothing in the house for the
mother and children to eat and not a cent
of money with which to buy anything.
Besides bein? in danger of starvation, the
wretched family was also in danger of
I'-'Fing Its home. Since the strike com
menced they have had no money with
which to pry the rent and last week the
'fwncr of the house had the furniture
thrown into the street. But after the
landlord learned how destitute the family
was he gave permission for them to oc
cupy the house for another week.
Before the strike was declared Edward
Campbell as a. longshoreman was earning
FufScier.t money to support his famllv, but
as :-oon as the strike wÂ».s commenced and
he wa.Â« forced into idleness his family was
quickly reduced to suffering and want.
Campbell, as a member of the Longshore
men's Union, waf? entitled to strike
benefits, but his benefits amounted only
to a email suppiy of groceries. And the
supplies of groceries, insufficient as they
were for a growing tamilv. were discon
tinued aftÂ«=r the first few allowances.
Campbell, fearing to accept work in this
city lest hÂ» rhould be beaten by the strik
er?, left two weÂ»Â»ks ago for Uklah, where
he expected to secure work on the rail
road. Since then he has not been heard
from.
Secretary White turned the case over to
the Associated Charities and the members
of that society will try to alleviate the
sufferings of Striker Campbell's family.
A case of extreme destitution caused by
Longshoreman's Wife and Children
in Destitute Condition.
FAMILY IS STARVING.
members of the Metal Trades Association
ure determined more than ever not: to
accede to the demand of the strikers for
fa. nine hour day. Still, they fail to under
stand why the union permitted so many
of its men to return to work on an agree
ment calling lor ten hours temporarily,
and immecuateiy thereafter recalled the
machinists, all of whom were willing to
continue operations on the ten hour basis.
The only tneory advanced for this by the
metal trades men is that the union otiicers
feared that the moral effect upon the
strikers when it was gv neraliy known that
ten hours was the rule at the National
Foundry would be to cause a general
stampede, regardless of official ar
rangements, in order that the ieaders
mignt not lose control of the men, pre
sumably, it was decided to hold out for
the nine hour rule, and for that reason, it
Is argued, the union men at the National
Iron Works were recalled.
The statement issued by the Machinists'
Union at its meeting- Monday night that
the men returned to the National Iron
Works without any definite arrangement
concerning hours having been reached is
declared to be absurd by Messrs. Mar-
Ehutz and CantrelL proprietors of that
foundry. They a#ert that the men re
turned under the positive agreement that
they were to work ten hours until the
regular winter schedule of nine hours was
inaugurated. After the leaders had ac
cepted this proposition, the employers
reason, they realized that the act would
be regarded by the public as virtual
defeat for the strikers, and they therefore
recalled the men as stated.
The National Foundry was virtually
closed yesterday. In anticipation of the
possible return of the men who worked
Monday, the fires were started, but none
of the machinists appeared. A dozen or
two pickets were on hand, however. In
readiness to "argue"' the question with
the men should they come, but their
watching was fruitless. Several of the
men showed up during the day and had a
conference with Mr. Cantre'll, but the
latter stated that it was impossible to
grant the demand made upon him. This
was accepted a? final and the men re
turned to their homes.
That the machinists do not agree with
their leaders in all particulars was evi
denced when two union men went to worn
at the Union Iron Works. In addition to
these te:i molders and helpers were added
to the working force at that institution.
The management of the Risdon Iron
Works say that the ten men secured on
Monday worked yesterday and that they
were satisfied with the situation. The
men themselves say that they will con
tinue io work as long: as they are wanted.
They assert that they need money and
that the ten hour scale is perfectlysatis
factory to them.
The failure of the National Iron Works
people to retain the twenty-two men who
returned to work on Monday was the
subject of general comment among the
metal trades yesterday. It was believed
that the return cf the union machinists
In accordance with an agreement to work
ten hours practically settled the machin
ists' strike. When, after working half a
day, the men decided to work nine hours
only and promptly quit work at the expir
ation of that time the situation assumed
a new and more disagreeable phase.
Notwithstanding the result of Monday's
operations at the National Foundry, the
A meeting of hog owners has been called
for next Saturday at the Courthouse in
this city and steps will be taken to have
State and Government experts visit this
county and study the disease, which has
already caused a loss of upward of $50,000.
R. H. Blossom has lost 1000 hogs, Charles
Hesse 200, M. Gonsalves 223, Frank
Hougton . 250, W. Lantz., 500 and many
others smaller numbers. The disease has
just reached J. W. Boyd's band and J.
I. Casale has noticed' symptoms in his
drove of 500. It is estimated that 4000
hogs have died from the disease in this
county.
RED BLUFF, Oct. 1.â There has been
great mortality among hogs' in Tehama
County and in one instance, out of a drove
of 540, 500 have died. It is a fact worthy
of note that the hogs in good condition
withstand the disease much better than
those in poorer .condition and young hogs
suffer first.

''But that the American press is improv
ing and Is bound to improve cannot, I
think, be doubted by any one who has
come in .contact, as I have done, with the
men who have made it. However much
one may differ from their standpoint or
deprecate their methods, it is impossible
to deny their quick intelligence and
breadth of view, or the thorough earnest
ness and uprightness of purpose by which
the conductors of the press are actuated,
while In that which makes a press greater
in independence ( and incorruptibility,
financial, political or social, the American
can compare on equal terms with the
English press."
LONDON, Oct. 2.-An item in the Times
to-day by a special correspondent who
was recently in America, which is- cor
rectly attributed to Moberly Bell, man
ager of the Times, describes his experi
ences with interviewers and their capacity
to provide interesting copy, whether the
person interviewed contributes thereto or
not. In conclusion, however, the corre
spondent pays a high tribute to the
American Dress, as follows:
He also asked that some money that
was due him from the Montana Central
Railroad be sent to a niece, and ttyen he
was pulled up. The end of the rope was
tied to a pole and the crowd dispersed.
Later Sheriff McConnell cut the body
down and placed it In a coffin. \u25a0 There
will be an investigation to-day.
The march to the hanging place was
quiet. Brady, was given a chance to say
a word. He declared that they had the
wrong man, although he had been posi
tively identified by his victim and a score
of other people who had seen him with
the child.
The crowd was orderly and \ after the
man had been hanged it quietly dispersed.
There were about 200 men engaged in the
affair and they were . all masked. \u25a0 They
attacked the jail door with a battering
ram and it soon yielded. .--
On gaining admittance they demanded
the keys of the jailer at the point. of a
gun and threatened If he did not yield
the man up they would kill him. * The
jailer then got the. man out of his cell
and he was given to the mob. When they
first took him Brady asked:
"What is it, gentlemen?"
HELENA, Mont., Oct. 2.-James Ed
ward Brady, the man who committed an
unusually brutal assault upon 5-year-old
Ida Pugsley in Helena yesterday, was this
morning, about 1:30 o'clock, taken/from
the jail by a mob and hanged to a tele
graph pole in the Haymarket square,
about three blocks from the jail. .

Samuel Isaacson Becomes Husband
of Mrs. Carrie Bryant to Better
Fulfill Promise.
Justice of the Peace Long officiated at a
sad ceremony last Monday when he joined
Samuel Isaacson ' in wedlock to, Mrs.
Carrie Bryant, who is lying on her death
bed. The wedding .took place at 203%
Third street and was witnessed by A. Mc-
Cullouch arid M. Pedderson.
Mrs. Bryant is 33 years of age and has
a little girl 7 years of age. She had often
requested Isaacson to take care of her
daughter after she died, and it was
tnought'that he would have a better legal
right to do so if he married the mother.
Isaacson is 21 years of age. The mother
and newly made wife is slowly succumb
ing to the ravages of the disease that has
laid her low. 7
Glover the nominee of the convention,
and the physician took the stage and in
dorsed the plattorm and made the usual
promises.
"\*7hen it was announced that nomina
tions for Police Judges were in order Mr.
Currie again cained .the recognition of
the chairman, and as he took the plat
form he was cheered for his courage.
Mr. Currie aroused merriment by an
nouncing that' he had another candidate
who desired to give $10 to the birds. He
named Edwin M. Sweeney for Police
Judge. The speaker said his candidate
was not on the. slate, and he therefore
asked the delegates to show their inde
pendence and vote for him.
Lon E. Prescott of the Fortieth District
followed, and in' a eulogistic speech he
named Charles A. Low. H. G. W. Dinkel
spiel swung into line and named Frank
P. Hayne. Norman. W. Hall, a young
Republican from the Thirty-ninth Dis
1 trict, named John W. Koch.- Merten Cal
len and Mr. Hillman seconded the nom
ination of Mr. Hayne.
The surprise of the -convention was the
appearance of "Fat Jack" O'Connor, who
mounted the platform, paid his 110 and
named John W. Koch. The delegates
warned O'Connor that hi-s candidate had
already been named and advised him to
take back his money. The alacrity he
displayed in getting his money convulsed
the delegates. â¢>
The roll was then called and the vote
announced was as follows:
Frank P. 1 Hayne... ;.,.23S
Charles A. Low 154
John W. Koch 44
Edwin M. Sweeney 118
Nominations of Supervisors.
Chairman Riordan then announced that
Frank P. Hayne and Charles A. Low were
bly been kidnaped. A white man and
Chinese belonging to the Bow Ong \u25a0 so
ciety called at the restaurant Monday
afternoon and the highbinder pointed to
HIng Yow, saying "that is the man." The
white man pulled a paper out of his
pocket and said It was a warrant for

Mr. Greenbaum tried to bring order out
of chaos by asking for an adjournment
When the uproar was at its height Mr.
Hillman jumped Into the breach and
asked that the names be read before the
nominations closed. He said the dele
gates were desirous, of learning for whom
they were going to vote. He asked that
order be maintained and the delegates
listen to the names presented and weigh
them well before they voted.
Bichmond Club Makes Request.
. Edmund Tauzsky , tried to make a
speech, but his remarks were drowned in
an uproar of cheering and jeers. He suc
ceeded in. gaining attention by taking the
gavel. As temporary chairman he suc
ceeded in quieting the delegates. â¢
Myrtle Cerf tried ,to make a motion, but
had to desist. "Fat" Jack O'Connor

HOLDS LYNCHING
the nominees of the convention.
Nominations for Supervisors were then
in order and a delegate moved that there
be no nominating speeches. The motion
prevailed. Myrtle Cerf of the Thirty
eighth then made a motion that the nomi
nations be made by districts. Marc
Anthony seconded the motion and the
chairman ruled It. out of order." Anthony
took an appeal from the chair and a deal
of â¢ discussion was had. Leon Samuels
closed the long \u25a0winded speeches by mov
ing, that the appeal be laid on . the table.
A roll-call resulted in 259 ayes and eighty
eight noes. The chair ruled that the ap
peal was laid on the table, and despite
the points of order and motions stated
that nominations for Supervisors were in
order. For a time the nominations could
not be heard. The delegates, therefore,
satisfied themselves by handing the secre
tary the names of the candidates.
Chairman Riordan called the conven
tion to order at 8:20. The first business
of the evening was the nomination of a
candidate for City and County Attorney.
Mai-k Sheldon took the platform and
named Joseph E. Barry for the office.
Charles Sonntag seconded the nomination
and there being none other named, the sec
retary was instructed to cast the ballot
of the convention. Barry was then
escorted to the platform and after the
cheering bad subsided expressed his ap
preciation of the honor conferred upon
him and said if elected he would conduct
the office in a business-like manner.
John R- Hillman had me pleasure of
nominating John Farnham for the office of
Public Administrator. He paid a high
tribute to his candidate. He said Mr.
Farnham was unable to visit the various
districts during the last election owing to
Illness and had he been able to make a
canvass he would undoubtedly have been
elected, as he only lost the office by a few
hundred votes. C. E. Murdock paid a
high tribute to Mr. Farnham. He said he
>>bH honesty, backbone and all the other
qualifications that were necessary to be
elected.
He took occasion to say that the Forty
first District delegates were In the con-
\ r ention as an object lesson; that they
were there In defense of a principle, and
although they had little opportunity to
help make up the ticket, they would take
their medicine like men and would return
to their district without sore heads or
hearts and hoped they would meet the
other delegates on a more auspicious oc
casion.
When the applause had passed the
nominations were close! and the ballot of
the convention was cast for the candidate.
Mr. Farnham then mounted the platform
and was applauded. He indorsed
the platform, and thanked the delegates
for nominating him.
\u25a0 The next business in order was the
nomination of a candidate for Tax Col
lector. J. S. Partridge named Edward J.
Smith in a flowery speech and Leon Sam
uels seconded the nomination. The sec
retary cast the ballot of the convention
and Mr. Smith took the platform and
promised to fulfill the duties of the office,
if elected, to the best of his ability and
to the satisfaction of the taxpayers.
Attempt to Break the Slate.
Merten C. Allen took the platform and
deposited another 510 piece for the privi
lege of nominating a "live man for a dead
office." He named Dr. C. A. Glover for
Coroner. The speech was clever and won
the applause of the delegates. W. W.
Shannon seconded the nomination.
The first attempt to crack the slate was
made at this time. Arthur Currie mount
ed the platform and named Dr. A. D. Mc-
Lean. His speech was greeted with long
cheers by the gallery, which was anxious
to see the oiled wheels of the convention
slip a cog. Mr. Currie remarked that the
Forty-first District \u25a0was the only one
.not in captivity. When the laughter had
died out he begged the delegates to show
their independence by voting against the
elate. He wanted to see a small crack
in it. he said.
When the applause had ceased Marc
Anthony seconded the nomination of Dr.
McLean. The vote resulted as follows:
Dr. Glover 275 2-3
Dr. McLean 70 1-3
Chairman Riordan then declared Dr.
The highest vote, 298, was secured by
George B_ Sanderson. The popularity of
Horace Wilson. Dr. Boxton and T. "W.
Collins was attested by a large vote.
The chairman of the convention last
night after adjournment announced the
following committtee on purity of elec
tion:
L J. Truman, P. H. Frendergast, M. L.
Asher, Edward Kelly and Frank J. French.
The foregoing committee, together with
Chairman Riordan, is authorized to act as
the campaign committee.
The customary three cheers for the
ticket were not called for when the-con
vention adjourned. The nominations are
not received with -enthusiasm. The
friends of Asa R. Wells predict his elec
tion, however, and several of them re
marked yesterday that his election to the
Mayoralty would put the San Francisco
delegation behind him for Governor next
year.

county committeemen. The wrangle be
came so great that the chairman had
hard work keeping order. Martin Kelly,
to end the dispute, moved that the list

chairman of the Twenty-eighth be ac
cepted. Despite Delegate Currie's demand
for a roll call the motion was put and
carried.
A vote of thanks was extended to Chair
man Riordan and the secretaries.
The chairman* was empowered to ap
point a committee of twenty-five on puri
ty of election, and the county committee
was empowered to fill all vacancies on
the ticket caused by resignation or death.
