Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â Cuba's
destiny will be decided not by the men
Â¦who agree with the President, Secretary
Root and Governor General Wood that
lower rates of duty should be charged on
sugar and tobacco, nor by those who
favor protection of the beet sugar grow
ers and tobacco fanners, but by members
of Congress who believe the solution of
the whole question Is annexation.
There is a strong annexation sentiment
among members of both houses of Con
gress.
These men take the position that the
United States has done enough for Cuba
as a foreign country. They say that this
Government freed Cuba at an expense of
half a billion dollars, and that even be
fore the island is ready for self-govern
ment its representative men are here de
manding the lowering of tariff duties and
pleading poverty. They argue that as
soon as these concessions are made the
islanders will come with other demands
and will want to enjoy all the advantages
.tehood while maintaining a sepa
rate government of their own.
The point is made that it is time for
the Cubans to join in the movement for
annexation, and the plan of the repre
sentatives in the movement is to with
hold all such favors as a lowering of duty
untill they do come in.
It Is a policy of clubbing or starving
the Cubans into subjection and making
them become citizens of a dependency
whether they want to be such or not.
If the Cubans are really starving, these
men say, let them starve. The United
States should be good enough for them.
This is a brutal way of putting It, b-.it
the disposition of most members of Con
gress Is no longer to handle the Cuban
Question with gloves. There are enough
of this class to make it impossible for
the President to carry out the policy of
Secretary Root and General Wood.
This means trouble sooner or later. The
Cubans are approaching their first elec
tion and they are pleased at the prospect
of having a government of their own.
They intend to have that government.
and it is likely that an effort to force
reciprocity will have the effect of driving
the Cubans farther away and deferring
annexation for years.
When asked whether the annexation of
Cuba on terms similar to those under
which Hawaii was admitted will not up
set the economic conditions in this coun
try, especially among the farmers, they
reply that is not a matter to be consid
ered. They are willing to let^the Cubans
In and do not believe that the annexa
tion of the Island will hurt the beet sugar
growers, tobacco farmers or fruit growers
of California.
The injection of the annexation element
into the fight complicates it and makes
this question of relief for Cuba impossi
ble at this session.

COLON IS SURRENDERED BY THE DISHEARTENED LIBERALS
AND PEACE ONCE MORE PREVAILS THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA
COLON, Nov. 29.â C010n has been
surrendered by the insurgents to
General Alban, commander of the
Government troops and Governor
of the Department of Panama.
The surrender was agreed upon as the
result of the conference on b*oard the
United States gunboat Marietta yesterday
between the commanders of foreign war
ships and General Alban and General Do
mingo de la Rosa, the representative of
the revolutionists.
It was decided that Colon should first
be delivered over to the commanders of
the foreign warships this morning, the
United States authorities acting as the
chief intermediary.
The terms of the agreement of surren
der was signed at the close of the con
ference by Generals Alban and De la
Rosa, and were as follows:
Terms of the Surrender.
"First â General de la Rosa, leader of
the insurgent troops in Colon, will surren
der the city to General Alban, together
with all of the munitions of war, within
twenty-four hours.
"Secondâ General Alban will guarantee
life and liberty to all citizens and insur
gent soldiers in Colon, provided the de
livery of arms and ammunition is effected
in good faith.
"Thirdâ The surrender will be made
through the commanders of the United
States, British and French war vessels,
who Â¦â¢will receive the city and hand it
over to General Alban and the constitu
tional authorities; but this agreement does
not include General de la Rosa, nor his
brother, and the former has stated that
he will surrender in consideration of his
lack of defense and the exceptional situa
tion in which Colon is placed regarding
international interests as well as those of
his country.
"In faith of which we sign two copies
of this agreement, at place and on date
referred to.

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1901.
States gunboats Machias and Marietta,
with the commanders of .those war ves
sels and consular officers, were present at
the ceremony this morning of handing
over the city. Captain Perry of the bat
tleship lowa, as ranking United States
officer, took a prominent part in the cere
mony, which was begun at 11:30 o'clock.
There was. no music at the hauling down
of the flag of the Liberals, which for sev
eral minutes refused to be lowered. It
clung to the pole owing to the strong
wind. While the flag was being lowered
many of the Liberal soldiers, whose heads
were uncovered, burst Into tears.
General de la Rosa, In making the for
mal surrender, read an address, at the
close of which he shouted, "Viva Colom
bia." The insurgent soldiers around then
raised three cheers of "Viva, partido Lib
eral," and "Viva General de la Rosa."
After the cheering General de la Rosa,
with the insurgent soldiers, marched
down the street to the barracks, where
the United States marines and bluejack
ets took possession of the arms and am
munition.
General Alban, with 250 Government
troops, which had remained at Gatun, a
few miles from Colon, came into the city
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
Rosa Prefers Imprisonment.
The Federal force was escorted by the
United States marines and bluejackets to
the cuartel, where General Alban re
ceived and kept General de la Rosa' 3
sword.
General de la Rosa, after handing over
his sword, said that according to the
agreement the insurgent soldiers in Colon
were not to be deprived of their lives and
liberty, but as for his brother and him
self he declared that they waived that
part of the agreement referring to them.
They preferred, he said, to be impris
oned, as their hearts were with ,the Lib
eral party. General Alban replied that
he needed General de la Rosa in Panama
for pacification purposes.
In delivering over of the city of Colon
to General Alban Captain Perry of the
battleship lowa made a brief speech.
Alter he had finished the Colombian war
ship General Pinzon, which was bedecked
with flags, blew her siren in celebration
of the -surrender. The General Pinzon is
lying close to the wharf.
United States marines are still guard
ing the piers and railroad station. The
French cruiser Suchet has landed ma
rines on the property of the French Canal
Company.
Government Loss Is Heavy.
The surrender has cast a gloom over the
city. The struggle for the last several
days to keep Alban's force from recap
turing Colon was made by about 200 Lib
eral volunteers, who fought against 700
Government soldiers, well equipped with
munitions of war. The Government lost
in killed and wounded during the fighting
more than 300 men, while the loss of the
Liberals was about fifty.
It is reported that the main force of
Liberals is still intact In the interior of
the department.
It is said that United States Consul
General Gudger has ascertained that the
Government troops broke faith on
Wednesday by using a freight train on
the Panama Railroad as a cover by firing
between the cars at the insurgents. The
Liberals say tnat they did not return the
fire while the train was passing, in obedi
ence to the regulations of the United
States authorities.
ELUEJACKETS WILL WITHDRAW
Surrender of Liberals Insures Free

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â Peace has
apparently returned to Colon and Panama
and with free transit assured the United
States will immediately withdraw its blue
jackets. This satisfactory solution of the
isthmian trouble was reached as a result
of the defeat of the Liberal forces and the
intervention of American naval officers.
Consul General Gudger wired the State
Department to-day that the Insurgents
had been defeated and had surrendered at

Long:
"Arrangements for the surrender to-day
of Colon by the Liberal forces completed."
No fear Is entertained in official circles
that any European complications will
grow out of the isthmian trouble. Those
powers, including Germany, which have
ordered ships to Colombia, have been
careful to acquaint the United States with
their action and the instructions to com
manders of ships were to simply protect
the interests of their countrymen.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, S.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â The con
temptuous disregard by the present Gov
ernment of Venezuela of the rlght3 of
foreigners in that country and Its defiant
attitude in diplomatic intercourse with
other nations is steadily leading up to a
crisis, which, In the opinion of well-in
formed persons here, cannot be long de
layed. The United States, Germany and
Colombia have scores to settle with Gen
eral Castro, President of the republic,
who gained his present position by fore*
of arms, and is apparently seeking to re
unite all factions in hi 3 country through
an appeal to their patriotism to stand
firm against alleged foreign aggression.
In Refusing at this critical period in her
affairs to resume diplomatic relations with
Venezuela, the Government of Colombia
has thrown down a challenge which may
precipitate a conflict that will mean
either Castro's overthrow or his assump
tion of greater power than he now holds.
Predict an Early Clash.
Men here who have been observing thÂ«
situation carefully with a better knowl
edge of what is going on than is possessed
by the press and people of the United
States look for a clash at an tarly day
that will make the turning point in the
fortunes of Castro.
The difficulties between the United
States and Venezuela were practically co
incident with the assumption of the pres
idency by Castro. His attitude toward this
Government in the asphalt controversy
was regarded by the United States as de
fiant and almost insulting. The course of
Che United States in rescinding the order
for gunboats to proceed to the port near
est the Pitch Lake region for the under
stood purpose of preventing the Venezue
lan authorities from dispossessing thÂ«
New York and Bermudez Company waa
regarded by Castro a3 an indication of
fear of this Government to engage in hos
tilities with him. Although the transfer
of Che asphalt controversy to Venezuelan
courts for adjudication was believed to
have forestalled any prospect of a clash,
friction still exists and new causes have
arisen to bring about the resumption of
[he former uncertain situation.
President Castro' 3 Conceit.
Castro's treatment of Francis B. LoomiÂ».
United States Minister to Venezuela, was
deeply resented by the Washington admin
istration, whose action in recalling
Loomis, however, was regarded by Castro
as another tribute to fear of his strength,
which he believed he had inspired in tha
minds of those controlling American af
fairs.
That Ca3tro has been encouraging thÂ«
efforts to overthrow the present Con
servative Government of Colombia is gen
erally believed here. Colombia' 3 notice
to Venezuela that she will not resume
diplomatic relations has been confirmed
at the State Department in a telegram re
ceived to-day from Hart. United Statea
Minister at Bogota, and while this doeÂ»
not necessarily mean a conflict will fol
low, it places the two republics in rela
tion's even more delicate than heretofore
existed.
Castro is threatened from still another
quarter. This Government ha 3 not been
unmindful of the tone of the German
press on the question of Germany's claims
against Venezuela. One newspaper's ut
terance, believed to be inspired. w,as to
the effect that Germany's only hesitation
in sending warships to Venezuela to maka
that country pay its indebtedness to Ger
man concerns came from a fear of run
ning afoul of the Monroe doctrine.
No Interference With Germany.
There is reason to believe the admin
istration is aware the Berlin Ministry is
even considering the matter with a view
to action.
While collection by forcible measures
of debts due foreign subjects by Latin
American republics Is not regarded with
favor by the United States there is lit
tle, if any, danger that this^Government
will attempt in any way to interfere with
Germany in making a demand on Ven
ezuela backed by a fleet of warships for
the fulfillment of governmental obliga
tions to German subjects.
From some source officials here have
obtained the impression that Castro is de
pending on the application by the United
States of the principle enunciated by Pres
ident Monroe to secure Immunity from
German disciplinary measures. That Cas
tro, if he holds that belief, is very much
mistaken is franKly admitted.

May Result in a
Tragedy.

tive/
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AETURAS. Nov. 29.â For a time to-day
the prospect for a "gun play," growing
out of the Lookout lynching case, ap
peared very rosy. During his examina
tion of a venireman this afternoon At
torney Raker, for the defense, asked if
the prospective juror were acquainted
with the "she detective." He referred to
Mrs. Summers, who is understood to
have given testimony against the lynch
ers before the Grand Jury. Raker was
promptly ca'.led to order by the court.
After the adjournment for the day Mrs.
Summers and her husband called upon
the lawyer for a retraction. For a few
minutes the situation looked decidedly in
teresting, but friends interfered and pre
vented a clash between the two men.
However, the feeling between them is
very bitter and there may yet be trouble.
Only one talesman was examined dur
ing the entire morning session of the
court. Henry Lorents. replying to a ques
tion by the prosecution, said that he did
not regard with favor an indictment by
the Grand Jury. He was challenged by
thÂ» prosecution, and the challenge was
denied by the court. Liorenz later said
that he would not consider the indict
ment at all. Lorenz's brother some tim?
ago married a daughter of Calvin Hall,
one of the men hanged at Lookout, and
Lorenz after that time entertained no
friendly feeling toward the Halls. He
said that he was a personal friend of all
the defendants, but declared this would
have no effect upon his verdict. Under
further statements by Lorenz that he
would not under any circumstances con
vict on circumstantial evidence, he was
excused.
During the afternoon session three
talepmen were examined. Scott H. Clas
pill was passed. A. L. Page of Cedar
ville was next examined. He was asked
by the prosecution if he would be influ
enced in any way by the fact that at
taches of the Attorney General's office
were assisting the District Attorney of
this county in prosecuting the case. He
replied that he believed that he would
and. further, that he was opposed to the
presecution of the case at all. Sir. Post,
for the prosecution, then asked him if it
was not a fact that he believed that when
that mob hanged those five men at Look
out it did a good job. Page replied that
he thought they "did not do a bad one."
Page was "excused.
The examination of H. G. Holm was
not completed when court adjourned un
til morning. Four talesmen have now
been passed.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
CAUSE OFJDEAFNESS.
Ih<j Host Common Cause Only Re-
cently Discovered.
It has been stated on good medical au-
thority that nine-tenths of cases of deaf-
ness are caused from catarrh or from sore '
throat trouble.
The little tube â¢which ' leads to the ear i
from the throat Is lined with a sort of vel- <
vety structure called mucous membrane. !
This membrane Is simply a continuation
of the mucous membrane lining of the
throat. . When disease of any sort attacks i
the mucous membrane of the throat it is
very liable to extend into the Eustachian I
tube and ud into the ear.
The history of nearly all cases of deaf-
ness Is like this: a cold is contracted and
neglected, other colds are taken the
throat becomes sore and inflamed, which.
Ie aggravated t>y particles of dust and !
germs from the air. This condition causes
the disease to spread into the tube that
- leads to the ear.
.It seems a little far fetched to say that
most cases of deafness are caused from
catarrh, but ft is certainly true, and any '
one who has had a severe catarrhal cold !
must have noticed how the hearing was
affected while the cold lasted.
With catarrh sufferers this impairment
- of hearing becomes chronic and grows i
worse the longer the catarrh is neglected ]
You -can cure catarrh and deafness by '
the regular use of an excellent new prepa-
ration called Stuart's Catarrh Tablets i
composed of antiseptic remedies, which act
- both on the mucous membranes but prin-
cipally and most effectually on the blood
eliminating the catarrhal poison irom the i
system.
People whose hearing is defective may |
think it a little "remarkable that a simple Â¦
and harmless tablet would very often re- |
move all traces of deafness, but when it
Is remembered that catarrh causes :_ the
deafness and that the catarrh is easily
cured by the regular use of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets there is no mystery about it.
If you are subject to nasal catarrh or I
catarrh of throat, . bronchial tubes or ca- !
tarrh of stomach and liver, the safest and !
most effective treatment is the new ca- i
tarrh specific, Stuart* Catarrh Tablets,

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 29.â J. H.
Seely of the Northwest mounted police
secret service, who was instrumental in
working up the evidence against O'Brien,
the murderer who was hanged in Dawson
severeal months ago, is authority for the
story of a crime committed by O'Brien
previously to the three murders for which
ie weat to the gallows. Seely says that
the details were learned only a few days
ago. The man who was killed was
named Hannaford. "Kid" West, the con
vict recently pardoned, says that in the
spring of 1898 he and O'Brien went cut
one night on the trail pear Dawson to
hold up some one. A man was met and
robbed in the usual manner. O'Brien,
with his insatiable lust for murder, was
not content with getting money, and
struck the victim upon the head with a
lead pipe about two feet long. The man
dropped in his tracks. West then dis
covered that instead of the victim being
merely knocked senseless he was dead.
He so remarked to O'Brien, who simply
B "We'll have to throw him in the river."
The body was then thrown into the
river and drifted down to where it was
afterward found. In August of 1899 two
constables were sent from Forty Mile to
the boundary line for duty. While on
their way down it was reported to them
that the "body of a man was lying on the
beach. A search was made and the body

On New Year's eve the Entre Nous in
tend giving another cotillon.
? â¢ â¢
The cotillon given by La Jeunesse in
Native Sons' Hall last evening was an
event that will live long in the memory
of the social set. It was in a measure a
military ball. Officers of the army and
navy presented a martial appearance in
their resplendent uniforms. Military trap
pings were used in the various figures
with grand effect. Debutantes handled
sabers, flags and guns with the familiar
ity of veterans. The hall was magnifi
cently decorated for the occasion.
From the center of the hall hung a can
opy of flags and streamers of red, white
and blue were caught at the aides of the
gallery by clusters of small flags. The or
chestra played patriotic marches and
melodies behind potted plants.
Lieutenant Conrad Babcock of the
United States army and Ensign E. R.
Miller of the navy led the cotillon. The
patronesses of the cotillon were:
Mrs. William H. Mills. Mrs. A. H. Voorhies,
Mrs. William McKittrick. Mrs. John D. Spreck
BECOMES MANIAC
IN PRISON CELL
Woman Accused of Rob
bery Gives Way Un
der Disgrace.
6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 29.â Raving for her
freedom and tearing her unkempt hair
and clothing, Mrs. Mary Clarke paces the
Insane cell of the County Jail, apparent
ly a hopeless maniac. Her mind has be
come deranged from brooding over a
charge of robbery against her and the
possibility of being sent to the peniten
tiary.
Mrs. Clarke's case is a peculiar one.
Three weeks ago she came from Sacra
mento with her infant child to become
housekeeper for John Horan, a railroad
attache living in Copley. Ten days ago
Horan went to call his housekeeper and
found only her babe. The woman had
disappeared. A trunk in the room, con
taining the jewels of Mrs. Htfran, who
died recently, had been broken open and
diamonds, a watch, necklace and trinkets
valued at nearly $1000 had been taken.
Thirty-six hours later Mrs. Clarke was
arrested in a suburb of Redding. She
sJB-id she was going to Anderson, ten
miles below here. She had walked
through the rugged, brush-covered hills
from Copley. Her shoes were worn and
torn from her feet and her skirt was in
ribbons. She denied having taken the
jewels and had none upon her. She hint
ed that she had been insulted by Horan.
She cried for her babe. A short sickness
in prison was followed by violent in
sanity.
Mrs. Clarke is a handsome woman of 30
years.

MECHAM'S LUCK
Texas Oil Fields Yield
Riches to Bankrupt
Speculator.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 29.â George B. Mecham,
formerly one of the largest mining oper
ators and townsite speculators in this
State, has pleased a large number of cred
itors and friends by sending money to
Spokane and Molson for the payment of
debts contracted by .him during the
"boom" times some years ago. News
comes from New York that in the past
few months. Mecham has cleared more
than $250,000 in oil speculations. He hur
ried to Beaumont when oil was struck in
Texas and has since been making money
rapidly. Going to New York and Mon
treal he promoted several oil concerns
and seems destined to become a million
aire.
Mecham has the reputation of being a
money maker and plays for big stakes,
having already made and lost three for
tunes. Six years ago, while operating on
the Colorado Springs stock exchange, his
profits for several months exceeded 5100,
00. One of his luxuries was a private
wire between Chicafgo and Colorado
Springs for which he paid $22,000 yearly.
Three days after President Cleveland's
famous Venezuelan message he was prac
tically "broke."
When the southern half of the Colville
Indian reservation was opened Mecham
became interested in mines in that lo
cality. He bonded the Lest claims obtaina
ble, organized a syndicate in Montreal
and platted the town of Molson, in the
heart of a rich agricultural and mining
section. At a critical Juncture his Mon
treal backers withcrew. Mecham was
left in the air, owing his creditors large
sums. Soon afterward he went East and
little was heard of h!m until news came
of the fortune he made in oil speculation.
Present indications are that every man
whom he owed will be paid in full with
interest.

SEAMEN ABE NEEDED

International Union Considers the
Present Personnel of the Mer
chant Marine.
BUFFALO, N. V.. Nov. 29.â The com
mittee on resolutions of the convention
of the international Seamen's Union of
America reported to-day. The report
was adopted. The bill Introduced in the
last Congress to amend the laws relating
to American seamen and to improve the
personnel of the merchant marine was
indorsed and its reintroduction urged.
The report of the committee calls atten
tion to the undermanning of all classes
of vessels. The employment of Asiatics
as sailors is condemned. Attention is
called to the loss of the Rio Janeiro and
the conduct of the Chinese crew on that
vessel when she was wrecked near San
Francisco.
"We would insist," the report continued,
"that if our country is to be able to use
its growing navy seamen must be pro
vided and preferably native seamen. Un
less the American boy can be induced to
seek the sea for a livelihood there will
be no field from which the navy can be
recruited In time of need. It is idle and
dangerous to depend upon foreigners to
defend at all times the honor of the flag
under which they serve as mercenaries "
Congress is petitioned for an increased
appropriation for the marine hospital ser
vice.

HEAVY RAINFALL
CAUSES A SLIDE
Wall of Earth Crashes
Down Upon Sierra
Railway.
Construction Force Has Nar
row Escape From Burial
Alive.
ANGELS, Nov. 29.â The heavy rainfall
of the past few days caused an immense
landslide on the new extension of the
Sierra railway, near Robinson Fenry, oa
Wednesday night. There is a big cut at
that point and a wall of earth eighty
feet high and 100 feet in length waj
loosened by the moisture and slid down
upon the track. The wagon road also
was covered to a great depth. The con
struction gang had a narrow escape, as
the camp was moved just the evening
previous to the accident. It would have
been completely covered by earth had it
remained where it was. A large force of
men is engaged in clearing the track and
wagon road, but it will take some time to
move all of the loose dirt.
The rainfall at this place for the storm
was 1.61 inches, making a total of B.<B
inches for the season, against 11.60 a year
ago Many mines will now be started, as
there is sufficient water to keep them
Nov. 29.â For the twenty
four hours ending at 7 o'clock this morn

EVIDENCE MAY
AMAZE A JURY
Case in Chicago Court
Gives Promise of
Sensation.
CHICAGO, Nov. 29.â A sensational
outline of the State's contention of the
case wherein Alexander Sullivan, a law
yer, is charged with conspiring to keep
out of the State James J. Lynch, a for
mer bailiff, charged with jury-bribing,
was given. to a jury in Judge Smith's
court here to-day.
Attorneys Frederick St. John, Edward
W. Maber and George P. Murray, a rail
road detective, were indicted with Sulli
van on the conspiracy charge, but Sulli
van secured a separate trial. Both Indict
ments were voted, following the unex
pected return of Lynch after nearly three
years spent as a fugitive. The case out
lined to the jury was founded chiefly on
the story told by Lynch to the grand
jury. Briefly, Assistant State's Attorney
Barnes' statement was as follows:
L-ynch was a bailiff of good -reputation,
but* in a suit for damages against the
West Chicago Street Railway, Sullivan
being counsel for the defendant, he was
prevailed upon to bribe a juror to work
against the Interests of the plaintiff. The
bribery was discovered. Lynch was in
dicted, arrested and released on bonds.
George P. Murray. Barnes declared, was
sent by Sullivan to Lynch, and arranged
a meeting between Lynch and Sullivan.
The latter insisted on Lynch taking
, flight. Lynch demurred and accused Sill
's van of "ruining his good name," but
/ R-as eventually persuaded, "for the good
of all concerned," to depart. . He went to
New York and thence to Canada.
Sullivan was to pay him 575 per month,
but Lynch found this was not enough
and the sum was raised to $150 a month.
He was also given $4500 to reimburse him
for his loss in jumping his bail. bond. He
spent most of his time in Canada. An
effort was made to get him to go to Nica
ragua but he refused. He was constant
ly in 'fear that, his life would be taken.
After two years' absence, filled with re
morse and longing for his family. Lynch
made up his- mind to return to Chicago.
His resolution was strengthened by the
alleged fact that the monthly, remittances
had ceased. . , - Â¦
The greatest care was exercised in se
lecting a jury to try the case. Several
venires were exhausted. Both the prose
cution and defense maintained a special
corps of detectives to look up the ante
cedents of every venire man.

Recommendations on the
Currency Question
Are Made.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.âAccompany
ing the annual report of Secretary Gage
is a report made by Special Commissioner
Charles A. Conant, who was sent to the
Philippines to investigate the currency
question. His recommendations are sub
mitted to Congress for its action. The
most important are;
There should be a distinctively Philip
pine coin of silver, which shall be legal
tender for 50 cents in gold, to be called
the peso, and to contain twenty-five
grammes of silver. The coin is to be is
sued in such quantities as trade requires
and sustained at a, parity wtih gold by
limitation of the arrrount coined. The
Mexican silver dollar and other coins
shall cease to be legal tender after a cer
tain date.
It also is recommended that national
banks in both the Philippines and the
Tnited States should have authority to
establish branches throughout the islands
and in the United States. Power to issue
notes should not be extended to any bank
having a capital of less than Jsoo,o(k>.
Mortgage banks with a capital not less
than $1,000,000 are recommended to make
loans on real estate.
It is recommended that the Treasurer
of the United States be authorized to re
ceive deposits from the Government of
the Philippine Islands, and that the treas
ury of the Philippine Islands may be
designated by the Secretary of War as a
legal depository of public money.

POISON HASTENS
EARL LI'S DEATH
Chinese An
ticipates Coming of
the Reaper.
Account of His Alleged Sui
cide Is Permitted in a
Japanese Paper.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 29.â 1n a Jap
anese paper, which arrived on the liner
Glenogle to-day, it is declared that Li
Hung Chang took poison to hasten his
death. Realizing that his end was near,
and that there was no hope of relief from
sunering except in death, the aged Chi
nese statesman is said to have committed
suicide.
Japanese papers received on the Glen
ogle have long articles commenting on the
events in the career of Li Hung Chang,
and they all agree, that the big mistake
of his life was his policy toward Korea,
which brought about the war with Japan.
Others add that he was about to repeat
the mistake- by his advances to Russia.
It is said that when he realized that the
end was near he telegraphed to Prince
Ching, urging him to return to Peking,
and advised that Yung Lv be appointed
his successor. He urged other leaders to
come to Peking and take up the fight for
their country.
In spite of Li's precarious condition M.
Lessary, the Russian Minister, continued
to press the dying statesman to sign the
Manchurian treaty.
SENATOR WITHDRAWS
FROM POPULIST PARTY
Heitfeld of Idaho Announces His Af
filiation With the Democratic
Party.
BOISE, Idaho, Nov. 29.â United States
Senator Henry Heitfeld of this State -has
addressed a letter to D. H. Andrews of
this city, chairman of the Populist State
Central Committee, announcing his with
drawal from the Populist party and his
affiliation with the Democracy. After re
cifing the history of the Populist party
the letter says:
"Since both the Democratic and People s
parties now are striving for the same pur
pose I am unable to see why we should
keep up separate organizations, since by
combining forces in name as well as in
fact we can better subserve the interests
of the great principles we advocate."
He concludes by asking Andrews to call
the State committee together, expressing
the hope that it will approve his action
and unite with him in an affiliation with
the dominant element of the Democratic
party. When seen to-night about the let
ter Chairman Andrews indicated that he
did not approve of Senator Heitfeld's ac
tion and that he would reply to the Sen
ator's letter instead of calling the com
mittee together.

DOUBTS STORY
OF HER DEATH
American Official Sends
Report About Miss
Stone.
Turkey May Soon Be Re
quired to Apprehend
the Brigands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â Apprehen- !
sion concerning the fate of Miss Stone )
has been aroused as the result of the re- Â¦
iteration by the press dispatches of the
statement that Miss Stone and her com
panion, Mme. Tsilka, have been murdered
by the brigands who abducted them.
Eddy, secretary of the American lega
tlop at Constantinople, is making an in
vestigation of the report. He has cabled
Secretary Hay that he does not place any j
credence in It.
As a general reminder to the authorities j
of Turkey the United States training ship j
Dixie left Naples to-day for Smyrna. If >
the brigands have escaped into Turkey ;
this Government will require the Turkish
Government to apprehend and surrender
them to Bulgaria for punishment. So far
as Bulgaria is concerned Immediately up
on the receipt of proof of Miss Stone's
death a demand will be made for full
reparation, the punishment of the persons
involved in the abduction of Miss Stone
and indemnity for the heirs of the mur
dered woman. 1
SOFIA, Nov. 29.â With reference to the
reports of the death of Miss Ellen M.
Stone, the captive American missionary,
the Government holds that if the brig
ands exasperated by the delay, have mur
dered Miss Stone, Dickinson, the diplo
matic agent of the United States, is re
sponsible for the delay and not the Gov
ernment of Bulgaria. The latter has not
interfered with Dickinson's emissaries,
nor did the Government move troops after
Dickinson opened communication with the .
brigands.
According to a letter dated Dubnitza. j
November 2S, Miss Stone and Mme. Tsilka
are still alive. The letter in question
further says that at a recent meeting of
the committee held in Dubnitza it was
definitely decided not to kill the prisoners
upon any pretext whatever. Nevertheless
the committee insisted upon the payment
of the full amount of the ransom.
A naive suggestion is current in political
circles here to the effect that the United
States should force Turkey to pay the re
mainder of the ransom and as soon as Â¦
the prisoners are in safety force Bulgaria
to punish those persons guilty of their :
abduction.
STREET FIGHT LEADS TO
CAPTURE OF A ROBBEE
Thug Gets Into the Toils Through
Taking His Uncle's Val
uables.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 29.â A fist fight and
the arrest of Joaquin Higuera on the
charge of battering his uncle, Manuel
Higuera, to-day, led to the identification
of the" former as the footpad who held up
and robbed Charles Figueroa on Vine
street last night.
Manuel Higuera, a woodchopper above
Los Gatos, came to San Jose yesterday
to spend Thanksgiving and met his
nephew. Joaquin Higuera. The two had
many drinks together, and last night oc
cupied the same quarters. When Manuel
Higuera awoke this morning he found
he had been robbed of $8 50. Meeting
Joaquin Higuera on the street he ac
cused him of the theft. A fight followed
and the nephew was arrested.
After robbing his uncle last night
Joaquin Higuera went out to increase the
amount. Meeting Figueroa he knocked
him down with a blow from behind and
then relieved him of $3 and a watch.
When arrested to-day Figueroa's watch
was found on Joaquin Higuera, and he
finally confessed his guilt. Two charges
of robbery, with a prior conviction, will
be placed against him. Higuera recently
served 120 days in the County Jail for
"tapping a till" in Gilroy.

COMPANY BLAMELESS
FOR MINE DISASTER
Inspectors Report on the Catastrophe
That Occurred at Telluride, in
Colorado.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 29.â State Com
missioner of Mines Harry A. Lee to-day
received the report of the two inspector:?,
F. H. Nye and P. H. Clifford, who were
sent to Telluride to investigate the recent
accident at the Smuggler-Union mine by
which twenty-five men lost their lives.
The report fully exonerates the com
pany from any blame in the matter and
says the fatalities appear to have resulted
from a failure on the part of those pres
ent to realize the danger until it was too
late to avert it. The opinion is expressed
that had the door at the mouth of the
Bullion tunnel been closed promptly, few
if any deaths would have resulted.

CUBANS WANT
ISLAND FLAG
General Wood Thinks
Annexation Is Not
Practicable.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Among the pas
sengers who arrived yesterday from Ha
vana were General Leonard Wood, Gov
ernor of Cuba; Mrs. Wood, M. J. Dady,
the contractor; Sir William Van Home,
Lieutenant W. B. Arden and Lieutenant
Frank McCoy. .
General Wood said that he would pro
ceed directly to Washington to report to
President Roosevelt, 'and expected to re
turn to Cuba on December 7. He said he
had expressed no opinion on the question
of the annexation of Cuba, and to do so
would be impolitic. Matters were quiet
in Cuba and preparations were being made
for the election in February.
"Of course," said General Wood, "there
are a number of people in Cuba who de
sire annexation, but I doubt the possi
bility of securing a canvass of the ques
tion. The pepple of Cuba wish to see
their flag floating over Morro Castle, even
if it were only for a week."
Dady says the City Council of Havana
by a unanimous vote gave him the Ha
vana contract for public improvements
there and that .the plans and specifica
tions are in preparation for presentation
to General Wood, who will consider them,
on his return to Cuba.

by the committee prohibiting trans-Atlan

During this discussion Count yon Posa

efforts now being made by foreign coun
tries to secure the world's carrying trade
Germany must not go to this extreme for
the sake of Sunday rest. Only Socialist

voted for the retention of the clause.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ROOT REBUKES
FEARSOME CUBA
Alleged Interference in
Elections Sharply
Denied.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â Secretary
Root to-day addressed a communication
to Elijio Bonachea, president of the con
vention at Havana, Cuba, that nominated
Bartolomeo Maso for President, relative
to complaints that the United States was
interfering in the elections.
A press dispatch from Havana staged
that Maso complained that the influence
of the United States officers was being ex
erted in favor of Estrada Palma and a
dispatch from Bonachea to the Secretary
implied the same thing. The Secretary in
his communication -to Senor Bonachea
says:
"I have the honor -to acknowledge the
receipt of your dispatch of November 26
saying. 'The National Convention of Ha
vana, which has proclaimed General Maso
candidate for the Presidency of the future
republic of Cuba, respectfully asks you
to recommend to the representatives of
the intervening Government the strictest
impartiaity in the electoral contest wh.'ch
is now taking place.'
"The representatives of the intervening
Government in Cuba are already aware
that their duty requires them not to be
merely impartial in the electoral contest in
Cuba, but to refrain from interfering in
any manner whatever with the free ex
pression of the wishes of the Cuban peo
ple at the polls. They have not violated
this rule in the past and will not in the
future. They will have nothing to do with
the electoral contest, except to enforce
the electoral law prescribed by the consti
tutional convention and promulgated by
the Military Governor on the 14th of Oc
tober last. This will be done impartially
and effectively.
"It is quite unnecessary to assume that
the officers of this Government will be loss
faithful to their duty hereafter than they
have been in the past, or to recommend
or direct that they shall perform a duty
which they are already performing."

Pan-American Congress
Asked to Establish
Rules.
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 29.â The session ot
the Pan-American Congress this morning
was largely taken up with reading of re
ports of the committee on international
banking and monetary exchange and on
literary relations, the latter favoring an
exchange of official publications and a
lengthy report of the committee of which
Senator Davis is the head with respect to
the Pan-American railroad.
A project was submitted by Buchanan
of the United States delegation on com
mercial nomenclature. Buchanan said:
"The importance of this subject tÂ« thÂ«
commerce of the republics represented
here is one that has been frequently and
forcibly brought to my attention and I
have reached the firm conviction that if
uniformity of name and description can
be secured for the common articles of
Pan-American commerce and such nom
enclature otncially adopted and made the
basis of the customs schedules and law 3
of the republics of this hemisphere a dis
tinct and valuable step forward in all that
appertains to the general betterment of
commerce will be gained. "
Buchanan proposes that the govern
ments represented in the bureau of Amer
ican republics contribute among them
selves the sum of $40,000, with a view to a
careful revision and compilation in Eng
lish, Spanish and Portuguese, and under
the direction of the customs division of
each of the said governments, of the com
mercial nomenclature of the American re
publics heretofore issued by the bureau of
American republics. Buchanan'3 proposal
was referred to the committee on com
merce.

"CRUZADOS IS THE FASTEST HORSE IN THE WORLD"
EXCERPT FROM AN
INTERVIEW WITH
TRAINER CAMERON
YOUNG DOGS
MAKE BIDS
FOR HONORS
Champion Coursers Are Being
Dethroned by Fast Puppies
That Are Now in the Game
Crowds Increasing at Union
Park and Leashmen's Sport
Takes en Prosperous Look
The sport of the leash is enjoying a
boom at present that is felt on all sides.
Never before in the history of the game
has coursing taken on such a prosperous
look. The increased attendance at the
weekly meets has reached a proportion
that is gratifying to the coursing asso
ciation and dog owners alike. In return
for their patronage the followers of the
sport are treated to a class of coursing
that is admittedly superior to that of any
past year. The condition of the hares at
this particular season is a large factor
in the betterment ul the last and inter
esting trials that have delighted the
crowus in attendance. According to vet
eran ieashmen, it is not of record that
the hares have held their strength and
speed so far into the rainy season.
While many of the old hounds that
have been campaigning through several
seasons are still in the running and hold
ing their own, new performers are com
ing in and are mating reputations for
themselves. Hardly a stake is run in
which some well-bred youngster does not
figure. The more than occasional sensa
tional work of the newcomer forces the
wise bettors to do some figuring.
Albert Curtis has a number of promis
ing young hounds coming on, which he
figures wiil equal if not excel his present
strong kennel of stake-winners. Of the
puppies that are likely candidates for
future events a litter by Fetter Free, out
of Echo, ajid one by Chartist, out of
Maud S, give the most promise. Already
Mr. Curtis has given his young coursers
trials in private with the older and ex
perienced big ones, and the results have
* been more man satisfactory to him.
J. Horn has a promising litter by
Rocker, out of Bona. The youngsters are
pronounced a fine looking lot, and, con
sidering: their breeding, the prediction
that they will develop into early stake
winners is Quile natural.
Some of the crack performers of the
Pasha Kennel will be sold at auction at
Tmion Park on December 15. The kennel
for some time past has been overcrowded
and the weeding out process was finally
decided upon. Twelve coursers, all of
them with records familiar to the follow
ers of the sport, will be disposed of. The
list includes Lawrence, Snapshot, Risky
Attempt, Random Aim. Royal Alliance.
Rude Awakening. Belle Clair, Belle
Rocket. Rustic Arbor. Gold Hunter
(imp.), formerly Gold Xugget, by Fabu
lous Fortune-Gatherer, and Real Lassie
(imn.). by Cocoa Wine-Here and There.
The sale of these greyhound? will distrib
ute some good blood lines among the local
kennels.
Battle Royal, a celebrated *tud dog of
Montana, has been sent to this city. The
hound has been placed in rtiarge of A. J.
Vanderwhite.
Dr. F. P. Clark of Stockton has pur
chased Royal Anne from the Pasha Ken
rels and will run her in the future in the
Slough City.
At the Stockton Park the slips are
shorter than on the local field, and with
that advantage .Royal Anne should show
the way to the Ware to all her new op
ponents.
Union Park present? a strong card for
Â¦f "-.-morrow. In addition to the open stake
finals a champion event will be run. The
event is made up of the pick of local
mursers. among which is Little Sister,
who holds the record of stake-winning
bitches in America.
OARSMEN FIND PLEASURE
IN THEIR WINTER DANCES
Planning to Rebuild BoAthouses Re
moved Owing to the Demolition
of Long Bridge.
The annual entertainment of the Ariel
Rowing Club last Saturday night assumed
the form of a masquerade ball given in
Saratoga Hall. Though the rain kept
some visitors away, the dance was suc
cessful. i 'Â¦
The club has enough money on hand to
begin work on the new quarters so soon
as the site has been definitely settled.
The Pioneers, when their old house on
Long Wharf was removed, built a rough
shed on Kentucky street, in which their
boats and rowing equipment are stored.
By carrying the boats across the street
the water can be reached. It was sug
gested that the Ariels should erect the
temporary quarters jointly with the Pio
neers, but as the expense was considera
ble and the shed will be a considerable
distance from the water when the seawall
Is built the Ariels contented themselves
with storing their 'boats and oars in a
warehouse.
The election of a new board of officers
to serve for the coming year will take
place at the meeting of the Ariel Rowing
Club on Monday evening.
The nominating committee of the Dol
phin Rowing Club has selected the fol
lowing as the regular ticket for the com
ing half year: For president, Joseph S.
Earls; vice president, Charles M. Farrell;
recording secretary. Will H. Bush; finan

Cricketers Are Entertained.
A meeting of the California Cricket As
sociation will be held on Monday evening,
December 9, to receive the report of the
committee appointed to prepare the bat
ting and bowling averages for the past
season, and to award the prizes offered
by Captain John Metcalfe,-first vice pres
ident or the association. The question of
a ground for next season will also be
discussed. Â£
The members of the Alameda Cricket
Club were entertained- at dinner last
Tuesday -by Edward Brown, president of
the club. The report of Henry Ward,
secretary of the club, showed that during
the past season ten matches had been
played for the pennant presented by Pres
ident Brown, of which the club had won
five, drawn two and lost three, giving a
percentage of 60. This brings the Ala
meda Club out a little ahead of the Santa
Cruz Country Club, which has a percent
age of 53.3. The percentage of the Pacific
Cricket Club is 55, and that of the Sac
ramento Club Is 16.C. President Brown
desired the younger members to state
definitely whether it is their intention to
play for the Alameda Club. next season.
On their stating that they so intend he
urged them to do all in their power to
preserve harmonious relations with their
fellow cricketers and to promote a gen
uine love of the game. Harold Ward Jr
and H. W. Brown were chosen as dele
gates to the California Cricket Associa
tion for 1902; J. J. Moriarity, Harold Ward
Jr. and F. J. Croll were selected as mem
bers of the executive committee, and W
G. Fortmarm, B. Bird and A. F. Stahl as
members of the ground committee. -
Bernard Ward Remanded.
The writ of habeas corpus for the re
lease of Bernard Ward, ex-treasurer of
the Marine Firemen's Union, who was
held to answer on a charge of felony em
bazzlement, was denied by Judge Cook
yesterday. The prisoner was remanded
into the custody of the Sheriff.
CRUZADOS is looked upon as the
sensational horse of the Califor
nia turf. The concensus of opin
ion among horsemen is that if the
son of Emperor of Norfolk will
"go on" he will do to cross the Rockies.

GOLFERS PLAY
IN THE RAIN
Thanksgiving Day Contests Are
Keli Under Conditions Which
Would Stop Any but Devotees
Despite the unfavorable weather on
Thanksgiving day there were tourna
ments on all the local courses. On the
Presidio links there was a 36-hole handi
cap tournament for three prizes; at Oak
land the formal opening of the winter
season was made with the first competi
tion for the Goodall cup, and at Sausalito
the golfers held a contest on the Fort
Baker links for the Foster cup and a spe
cial prize. On the San Francisco Golf
Club course the contest for the Council's
cup for men is still in progress. The first
round will probably be completed to-day
and possibly one of the matches in the
second round may be played.
The next event of interest to local
golfers will be the first home-and-home
match between teams representing the
San Francisco and Oakland Golf Clubs.
It has been the custom to have teams of
eight men in these matches, but the
number which will constitute the teams
in the matches this season has not yet
been decided. It seems that a team of
not more than six men would suit the
Oakland Club best, while the Presidio
golfers would be willing to put a team
of twelve or more men into the field. There
are five first-class golfers at Oaklandâ
E. R. Folger, holder of the amateur
championship of the Pacific Coast; F. S.
Stratton, holder of the amateur record of
78 for the Oakland course and winner of
the last contest for the Captain's cup; R.
M. Fitzgerald, W. P. Johnson and C. P.
Hubbard. All these are strong golfers
and the four first named are frequently
out for practice, besides entering all club
competitions. But between these five and
the rest of the members there is a con
siderable gap. The San Francisco Golf
Club has in John Lawson and B. D.
Adamson two golfers of the highest
class, while Lansing O. Kellogg, captain
of the club; S. L. Abbot Jr., H. C. Golch
er, J. W. Byrne, Warren Gregory, R. G.
Brown and W. H. La Boyteaux, deserve
places on a club team. To these should
be added H. B. Goodwin, formerly cap
tain of the San Francisco Golf Club, and
one of the strongest native-born golfers
here, and R. H. Gaylord, formerly secre
tary and winner of one of the contests'
for the Council's cup. Neither of these
has been seen on a golf course for some
time. It is probable both Captain Orestes
Pierce and Captain L. O. Kellogg will be
in favor of making the teams as large as
they can reasonably be made. The men
who are selected to represent their club
feel their efforts may turn the tide of
victory and defeat, and are stimulated to
more regular practice of the game.
Golfers in Great Britain are beginning
to discuss the new golf ball, which was
"used by several of the contestants in the
United States amateur championships,
both for men and women. But the ball
itself does not appear to have reached
Great Britain, though doubtless it Will
do so soon. It has a core of gutta
percha, around which are wrapped strings
of rubber, the whole having a gutta
percha covering with the usual nicks and
markings. It is said that drives from the
tee are lengthened thirty to forty yards
by using the new ball, so that it is par
ticularly helpful to golfers who drive a
straight but not a long ball. It is also
said to travel a long distance off an Iron
club. The disadvantage of the new ball
is that it is difficult to control on ap
proach shots; and on damp ground it
does not seem to have any appreciable ad
vantage over the gutta-percha ball of the
ordinary type. Against the win/1 it is be
lieved to be actually inferior, as It is
lighter and more easily deflected. The
Baltusrol Golf Club made an attempt to
â¢prohibit its use in an open tournament for
women, but this was, of course, entirely
erroneous, as the rules of golf do not
prescribe the size, weight or material of
the ball, and players are free to use any
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1901.
AUTOMOBILISTS
ARE ENERGETIC
Organizing; Country Runs and
Endeavoring to Gain the Use
of Park Roads and Drives
The meeting of the Automobile Club of
California at the Cliff House on Tuesday
evening was one of the most enthusiastic
that has been held by the chauffeurs.
President F. A. Hyde referred to his re
cent trip through the Eastern States,
during which he specially inquired into
the regulations governing the admission
of self-propelled vehicles into the public
parks of New York, Washington, Chicago,
Philadelphia and other cities. A hope
was expressed that the automobilists of
San Francisco will ere long be permitted
to use the public pleasure grounds freely.
R. R. l'Hommedieu, who has performed
the duties of secretary of the Automobile
Club for several months past, resigned his
office for reasons which were not stated
at the meeting, receiving a cordial vote of
thanks for his services. The question of
a button and cap badge for the chauf
feurs came up, designs prepared by a local
jeweler being submitted by S. D. Rogers,
former president of the Automobile Club.
A well-known member of the club ex
pressed a strong preference for a design
characteristic of the State of California,
and, though nothing definite was done, it
is likely that a grizzly Bear's head in
closed in a circle on which are the letters
A. C. C. will be the design adopted.
It was decided that the directors be em
powered to make arrangements with J.
M. Wilkins of the Cliff House to set apart
a large room on the fourth floor for the
use of the automobilists, where they may
meet. On Sundays a luncheon will be
set between noon and 2 o'clock. The reg
ular monthly meetings of the club will
be held on the night of full moon at
Cliff House. At the outing on Tuesday
night there were about fifteen automo
biles. As several of them were capable
of seating four persons, there were be
tween forty and fifty chauffeurs and
guests at Cliff House. On the return trip
an electric surrey driven by S. D. Rogers
ran short of power and was towed into
the city by a surrey operated by W. S.
Arnold. Charles L. Fair's Panhard-
Levassor machine was on Van Ness ave
nue, but did not make the run to Cliff
House. On the return trip a machine
driven by one of y the operators of the
Mobile Company was coming rapidly down
Golden Gate avenue, parts of the pave
ment of which were wet. The wheels
skid-led, hurling the machine violently
against the curbstone and throwing the
occupants out. The rig was wrecked, but
the occupants escaped without injury. A
smooth wet pavement is dangerous to a
machine going at a rapid gait, and no
automobilist should go over such a sur
face at a speed higher than eight to ten
mllos per hour.
Tuesday night's run was under the new
regulations recently issued by the com
mittee on runs, Robert Lennie being cap
tain. The next run will probably be into
the country, Niles Canyon having been
suggested aa the point of destination.
Signal Corps Will Play Alameda.
The game of football which was to have
taken place on Thanksgiving day be
tween teams from the Signal Corps and
from AJameda was postponed on account
of the muddy condition of the gridiron.
The game was postponed until December
7. both teams continuing their training.
Tickets sold for the original date will be
good for the postponed game.
thing they please. Nor can it be said
that it is taking an unfair advantage of
an opponent to use the new ball, as it can
be bought by any one in the open mar
ket. The attempt to prohibit the use of
the ball in the United States men's ama
teur championship contest failed, Walter
J. Travis using It and making an ex
cellent score. The strongest argument
against its use is that it is much more
expensive than the ordinary solid ball.
TENNIS COURTS
ARE IN DEMAND
Players Invade the- Park and
the California Club Ground's
Seeking- a Spell at the Nets
Although the weather of the past fort
night has not been the best for tennis,
the players have been out in great num
bers and some good matches have been
played. The crack players of a few years
ago are gradually coming back to the
game and in another month such men
as Will Taylor and Tom Driscoll will be
trying conclusions with the champions of
to-day. A match between either Taylor
or Driscoll and Smith would be interest
ing and would show where the former
stand. Taylor is a marvel of accuracy,
but it is doubtful if he could stand up
before the hard hitting fame of to-day.
Driscoll, although more brilliant than
Taylor, is hardly as effective.
"Bob" Ayre is one of the old timers
who has again taken up the game. He
showed considerable skill in a match last
Sunday on the local courts. Gus Taylor
was the first of the former cracks to re
turn to the game. Although his game
consists, mostly in getting the balls back,
he can hold any of the second class men
down.
"Dick" Erskine showed last Sunday he
in a hard man to beat when given a
liberal handicap. Smith allowed Kuehn,
the best man in the fourth class, "thirty"
and won, 6-2, 6-2. Erskine, who ranks
beiow Kuehn, received the same odds and
beat Smith 6-0 the first set. He also had
a good lead in the final set, being within
a point of winning twice, and with a little
luck would probably have won. Erskine
seems to be the- only man in the lower
classes v/ho knows the proper game Lo
play with a handicap. His success is
due entirely to the fact that he takes
chances. His swift service and hard
drives give the scratch men considerable
annoyance. Most of the men play a care
ful game and as the higher class men are
more skillful the handicap bothers them
but little.
The intercollegiate tennis looks to be
ah in favor of the University of Califor
nia this year. Berkeley has had a try
out already, and as a result the teams
representing that college will be picked
from the following men: Fred Brown,
Drummond McGavin, Herold Braly, Reu
ben Hunt and Trow Hendrick.
Stanford will reply upon Harry Wiehe
for victory this year. S. H. Adams, his
partner in doubles, has left college and
will not play. His place will probably be
tÂ£ktn by Duval Moore, who is a prom
ising player. With Wiehe for a partner,
he should do well in doubles.
The park players are improving rapidly
and will undoubtedly send several good
men into the championship tournaments
next year. There will be a tournament
on the park courts to-morrow. It will
probably be a class singles.
Olympic Handball Tournament.
The various winners up to the present
time in the Olympic Club handball tour
nament will meet to-morrow morning at
1 o'clock in a series of games. The play
ers are drawn as follows:
First classâ J. J. Gleason vs. H. V. Russ;
George James vs. William Cartwright; T. J.
Curley, a "bye."
Second class â Louis Levy vs. George Janes;
John Tait vs. M. Green and F. Stratford va.
Tom Poweis.
Third classâ Max Rosenfeld vs. T. I. FiÂ£z

Hagerty Charges Fraud.
Robert D. Hagerty, a member of the
stationery firm of Hagerty & Forsyth, is
suing his partner, A. C. Forsyth, for $150
damages and a dissolution of partnership.
He alleges that Forsyth, who keeps the
boftks for the firm, has by false entries
ana changes in accounts defrauded him
of $150 and has refused to allow him to
see the books or give an accounting. He
asks the court for the appointment of a
receiver to take charge of the affairs of
the firm.

MAY NOT SHOOT
BY MOONLIGHT
Game Wardens Are Watching:
in the Vicinity of Alvarado
for Violators of the State Law
The game wardens are determined to
put a stop to the shooting of ducks on
the Alvarado marshes after sunset and
before sunrise. Some days since a doc
tor and two of his guests were arrested
for participating in the unlawful sport.
The fine for persons convicted of violat
ing this section of the game law is $23.
As the game wardens receive half of this
for each conviction their interest is con
siderably sharpened. The sportsmen, who
would not think of taking advantage of
the moonlight shooting, naturally object
to men who do take this advantage and
return with big strings of birds. It
means a slaughter of ducks, as under
good conditions a great many can be
begged. The Hash of the shotguns has
the tendency to scare away a lot of birds
and in the long run makes bad shooting.
The sport last Sunday was of uneven
quality, men shooting from adjoining pre
serves obtaining widely different results.
On Thursday and Friday thousands of
biras were seen, but on Sunday they had
disappeared as if by magic.
The northern birds are now making the
Alvarado marsh a stopping place in their
flight to the south. The experts are able
to distinguish them from the home birds
by their full plumage and other charac
teristics.
Otto Feudner enjoyed another record
shoot near Denverton last Sunday. This
time he secured thirty "cans," twelve
mallard and eight sprig. The ducks werp
so plentiful that half his total number of
birds were secured in twenty minutes.
Down at the Spooney Gun Club pre
serve, near Mount Eden, three members
secured sixty birds. L. R. Larzalere Mr
Guyatt and William Whitehead were the
members out. When the sportsmen were
coming home Sunday afternoon the birds
were arriving in numbers.
Mr. Miller of Alvarado had one of the
best shoots of the day, killing thirty-five
birds.
On the Field and Tule Club preserve
near Suisun eight members had a suc
cessful day on Sunday. Two hundred
ducks in all were secured. The members
in attendance were J. B. Coleman H B
Hosmer, A. M. Shields, W. Bay, J. Ho
mer Fritch, Louis Titus, Colonel D. E
Miles and A. Warnecke.
The gunmen are not sure what sport is
in store for them to-morrow. Thdy have
ceased predicting and now go out ready
to accept conditions as they find them.
RELIANCE CLUB PROMISES
GOOD BOXING TOURNAMENT
Main Event Will Be a Match. Be
tween Frank McConneJl and
Jack Capeliss.
OAKLAND, Nov. 29.â The Reliance Ath
letic Club boxing exhibition, to be given
in the club gymnasium next Tuesday,
promises good sport for admirers of the
fistic game. There will be three contests,
all of which should be worth watching
The main event will be a fifteen-round

Valuable Estates Appraised.
The reports of the appraisers appointed
to determine the value of the estates of
Agnes Tillman and Henry Levy were
filed yesterday. They show that the Till
man estate consists of real estate in this
city and Alameda and Santa Cruz coun
ties worth $36,975 and that Levy died
possessed of stock, notes and real estate
worth $41,419 25.

ance, proving a perfect whirlwind in the
mud. Now it is claimed "Lucky" Bald
win is taking a long-distance peep at the
American derby of 1902, which classic
event has seen his colors four times borne
past the wire first. Trainer W. J. Spiers,
under whose careful supervision the colt
has been trained, makes no bones of tne
fact that his charge would have a great
chance in the big Chicago event, especially
if the track should happen to be muddy.
The picture shows Cruzados on his way to
the post, with Ransom up. The jockey
is wearing his rainy weather clothing.
Baldwin just now seems on the edge of
another great racing career. Some years
since a Chicago paper published an item
showing that since 1885, 74 horses had
raced in his colors. They started 875
times and won 209 races for their owner.
The value of the purses was $375, i 04.
D. Cameron, the astute Calgary horse
man and trainer of the fleet mare May
W, thinks Cruzados the fastest piece or
horseflesh he has ever seen, not even ex
cepting Commando. It is his opinion that
the two-year-old can cover four furlongs
close to 46 seconds.

OUST PROFESSIONALS
FROM COLLEGE ATHLETICS
Representatives of the Intercollegiate
Conference Make an Important
Ruling in Chicago.
CHICAGO, Nov. 29.-A long step to
ward the elimination of professionalism
from college athletics was taken to-day
by the faculty represenfatives of the
Intercollegiate College Conference who
held an all-day session here. The fol
lowing rule was passed:
"No student is eligible to compete in a
college team who plays in so-called ama
teur, semi-professional or professional
baseball games where gate-money is
charged, or where prizes, premiums or
purses are offered."
W , he i h .. er t s e rule ls retroactive was not
settled by the committee, and after the
meeting it was announced that this phase
of the matter had not been thought of
or discussed. It was voted to discourage
as far as possible prolonged absences
from college on tours. The Dicycle event
was dropped from all the programmes of
college athletic meets in the future a
rule was passed that the limit of four
years in college athletics, beyond wWh
a student is not eligible to contest means
four years in the aggregate, and not four
years on any one .team. ur

SACRAMENTO. Nov. 29.â The All- I

teams made their initial appear
ance on this -coast at the Oak
Park grounds this afternoon.
Owing to the heavy rains of yesterday
and this morning tne grounds were not
in good condition, but the two teams put
in a last hour and twenty-five minutes.
The game was won by the All-Americas
by a score of 10 to 3 through superior
batting and all-around better team work.
Napoleon La Joie, the famous second
base man of the Pnlladelpnia team, was

his lieJding record with an error on an
easy chance, was strong with the willow.
He cracked out a coupie of corking two
baggers, and the mignty Rube had no
terrors lor the Calif ornian.
If to-day's game can be taken as a cri
terion of the quality of ball put up by
the Americas and National League play
ers, the present aggregation traveling
under the name of the National League
team will have to strengthen its forces
or else it will prove a series of unbroken
victories for the All-Americas. Their
playing to-day was superior in every re
spect to that of their older rivals. * But
in connection with the game to-day it
might be stated that the All-Americas
had for their pitcher Waddell, who was
a member of the Chicago Club of the
National League until he went out on the
corn-crackers' circuit of Indiana.
On the other hand, the National League
Club had in "its ranks "Sandow" Mertes,
who during the past season played with
Comiskey's Chicago White Stockings of
the American League.
The game was played in remarkably
fast time, and a number of brilliant play's
marked its progress. Cantlllon, who offi
ciated as umpire, was quick and accurate
In his decisions and hustled the men in
and out of the field in a lively fashion.
Charley Irwin of the All-Americas lifted
the ball over the left field fence for a
home, driving in Lajoie ahead of him.
Fast fielding on the part of the All-
Americas on several occasions prevented
the Nationals scoring. The score:

Ihe defeat of Terry McGovern by
Young Corbett yesterday in Hartford.
This afternoon Sam Harris, McGovern's
manager, posted $2500 to bind another

Harris said:
"In order to get a return match with

"I don't wish to take away any of the

of the fight was due to a fluke. When

HIS BIG SECRET
Professor Wynn, Fam
ous Among Miners,
Dies Suddenly.
DENVER, Nov. 29.â Professor C. W.
Wynn, who recently created a sensation
in mining circles by the announcement
that he had discovered a process by which
he could recover enormous gold values
from what have been regarded as low
grade ores, died to-night at St. Joseph's
Hospital of strangulated hernia.
Professor Wynn had been in poor health
for a year, but was taken with the at
tack which caused his death yesterday,
being taken to the hospital at 6 o'clock
last night.
I-ittle is known by the public about the
Wynn process of gold extraction, and it
is discredited by many mining men, but
the fact that Willard Teller, a brother of
Vnited States Senator Henry M. Teller,
and ex-Judge fcidney Williams, both
prominent attorneys and capitalists of
this city, convinced of its truth, became
the financial backers of the discoverer,
gave it an interest to the nublic.
Professor Wynn and his partners had
been arranging for the establishment of
a large plant for the treatment of ores.
It is understood that both his partners
are the possessors of his secrets and that
hi.Â« death will not materially interfere
with their plans.
Professor Wynn was a native of Vir
ginia and was educated at the George-;
town University. His profession was that
of a chemist and for the last five years
he had devoted his entire time to the de
velopment of his gold process. He came
here from Kansas City in July last.
DES MOINES, Nov. 29.â 1n the United States

jurors.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1!K>1.
Tf-^ WING'S cripples fell victims to
j. the wiles of the Senators from the
"^ Capital City yesterday at Recrea
. I -^ tion Park. The field was wet and
sloppy, making fast plays impos
sible and materially aiding the error*col
umn. Schmidt twirled the first four in
nings for the cripples, and the Senators
found him for a total of seven runs and
nine hits. Waterbury, as amateur, was
then substituted, and he held Beebe's men
down to two lonely singles. He was in
superb form, passing only one man to
first and making five strikeouts. Levy
called the game at the end of the eighth
inning on account of darkness.
Sacramento started after Schmidt at the
outset. Four singles and a fly to center
by Davis gave them two runs. During the
second round Stricklett singled, and with
the aid of Hanson's error and Sheehan's
hit he completed the trip. The Capital
City sluggers added four more to their
list in the fourth, though only two hits
were made. A few errors and Schmidt's
wildness in hitting Devereaux when the
sacks were crowded did the trick.
Mohler made a tally for the Dudes in
the initial round. He hit, took second on
Francks' out to second and first, and the
rest of his journey was made easy by
"Wrd Bill" Devereaux's error. Babbitt
and Hamilton were there with runs dur :
ing the seventh. Singles by Hamilton and
Mohler, Flood's error and a wild pitch
were the principal causes of the damage.
Stricklett was in rare form. He had the
cripples entirely at his mercy at every
stage of the game. His ten strikeouts in
eight innings beats all records this sea
son. Devereaux hit an apparently safe
one to left field in the first, but little
Hamilton captured it after a hard sprint.
Hamilton also had his batting eye with
him, as he made two of the cripples' six
hits. Francks' one-hand catch of Stan
ley's hot drive in the fourth was deserv
ing of the hand it received, being one of
those hair-raising plays that are so sel
dom seen. The score:

it has been published that Corbett has
won the featherweight championship.
This is not true. McGovern defeated
George Dixon for the title of feather
weight champion, the limit for which is
122 pounds. When Terry won it he turned
the scales at only 118 and he is now ready
at all times to defend his championship
honors at the limit, 122 pounds, against
any one."
Tom Sharkey has taken charge of Dave
Sullivan, the featherweight pugilist, and
to-day issued a challenge to Young Cor

tackle Young Corbett under the same
conditions that Y r oung Corbett met Mc-
Govern yesterday. He is ready at any
moment to match at 126 pounds, the dura
tion of the battle being limited to twenty
or twenty-five rounds. Sharkey is willing
to bet $2500 or $5000 on the side

BRITT WINS
HIS BOUT
WITH BELL
The Olympic Club Light
weight Tak>s Only Half a
Round to Whip Opponent
Sam Berger Defeats Gallagher
on Points in a Lively Match.
Many Methods cf Boxers
James Britt, the Olympic Club's crack
lightweight boxer, sustained his reputa
tion last night as a hard hitter. In a
special tournament in the club gymna
sium he met Fred Bell and conceding him
some ten pounds in weight won cleverly.
The bout was scheduled for four rounds,
but Britt brought it to an end in one min
ute and thirty seconds' fighting in the
first round.
Neither man had done much work when
suddenly Britt landed a left hook on the
chin which knocked Bell unconscious. Be
fore he commenced to fall Britt's right
hand glove caught him on the head. The
force of the blow turned him around and
after he struck the padded floor there was
still enough impetus to cause him to roll
over.
S. Berger was given the decision over
Andy Uallagher, the amateur heavy
weight champion. Berger, with his long
reach, could outpoint his bulky opponent
boxing, but chose infighting instead. Gal
lagher landed frequently, but seemed to
do most of his hitting with the open
glove.
Bob Johnson and Barney Driscoll wore
the first brace of boxers in the ring.
Driscoll was the aggressor, although eacn
was trying all the time. The fight wa.-> a.
busy, bustling one. The decision was
given Johnson on points, he having land
ed the most clean blows.
Louis Richards was stopped by Paul
Martin in two minutes' fighting. Richards
seemed to have stage fright. His efforts
were slow and ineffective. He was
knocked to his knees and stayed down
the full ten seconds.
Erank George and Joseph Neilan came
together like a pair of battering rams, if
a kinetoscope picture machine man coul-1
transfer the action of the fight to his
films it would make his fortune. The
judges decided in favor of George. The
fight was the one dash of comedy to re
lieve the serious aspect of the night's
sport.
Al Ahrens knocked Harry Baker down
twice in the first round of their bout.
Baker was palpably out of condition.
Referee E. J. Smith stopped the bout lv
the second round.
The officials were: Referee, E. J. Smitn;
judges â W. J. Leonard and E. M. Graney;
timekeeper, F. R. Butz; announcer, R.

HEARING IN EKBERG
MURDER CASE IS BEGUN
Threats Made Against Life of Alma
Miller, Chief Witness for Pros
ecution.
The preliminary examination of John
M. Riley on a charge of murder for kill
ing Otto M. Ekberg a non-union team
ster, on Townsend street, between Ritch
and Clyde streets, November 9, was com
menced before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
afternoon.
Mrs. Alma Miller testified to seeing the
defendant strike Ekberg on the head with
a piece of pipe. She was within six feet
of him at the time and had a good side
v-iew of him. Riley kept his face turned
from her while she was testifying, out
she pointed to him as the man who struck
the fatal blow.
The. other witnesses examined were
Policeman David Koegel, Who saw the
body on the sidewalk and found a loaded
revolver in the deceased's pocket; Wil
liam E. Jones, secretary of the Nolan
Drayage Company, who also saw the
body lying on the sidewalk, and Charles
Johnson, a boy, who testified to having
had a conversation with the defendant the
day before the murder, in which Riley
remarked that he had not "got" Ekberg
yet, but he would "get him soon." Th&
case was continued till Monday afternoon.
Mrs. Miller complained to Captain Sey
mour yesterday that her life had been
threatened, supposedly by friends of the
defendant, if she testified against him. A
man called at her house Thursday night
pretending that he had a turkey for her,
but she refused to open the door. She
was assured of ample police protection.

GANG OF HOODLUMS
TO BE SUPPRESSED
Residents at Eleventh and Natoina
Streets Ask for More Adequate
Police Protection.
Hugh Hannan, Frank Moran, John Ben
nett and Thomas Kane appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday on a charge of
disturbing the peace. The complaining
witness was Mrs. O. J. Langmuth,
who has a store at 131 Eleventh street.
She and others testified that the defend
ants belonged to a gang of hoodlums who
gather on the corner of Eleventh and Na
toma streets and insult every woman who
passes. They also amused themselves, she
said, by throwing refuse and stones into
stores and breaking windows. The Judge
convicted the defendants and ordered
them to appear for sentence this morn-
A delegation of residents in the neigh
borhood, accompanied, by Attorney W. G.
Burke, waited upon Chief Wittman and
complained that the police protection was
inadequate. C. Code stated that his life
had been threatened by the gang because
he had complained to the police, and
asked for a permit to carry a revolver.
The Chief advised Code to make his ap
plication and it would be brought before
the next meeting of the Commissioners.
He also promised the delegation that ade
quate police protection would be provided
in future.

the shape of a private sanitarium at 1815
Sutter street, was called in Judge Fritz's
court yesterday afternoon the courtroom
was filled with witnesses. The Judge was
informed that there were thirty-three wit
nesses for the prosecution and forty-nine
for the defense. The Judge agreed to give
a whole week in the afternoons to the
case, commencing December 16, and it
was continued till that date.
ORDNUNG AGAIN BEATS AUTOLIGHT
IN THE MUDDY GOING AT OAKLAND
The Weaver Is Plunged en to Win a Maiden Event and Rameses
Downs Him a Neck in a Driving Finish â Cromwell Captures
a Purse â Botany Leads Out Sol Lichtenstein, a Hot Favorite
y-^ EFORE a crowd that looked
L^) small in comparison with the big
FyV holiday throng of the day before
JL_^/ the Schoor mud lark, Ordnung ,
gave Green Morris' crack per
former Autolight another beating. Once
before the pair met under nearly precise
conditions and the result was the same.
Even now there are many who think Au
tolight can reverse the verdict. This is
based no doubt on the start in yester
day's race, both Ordnung and Articulate
outbreaking the Morris entry. The three
horses named were the only starters, and
the friends of Ordnung once got 8 to 5 for
their money. At the start Johnny Woods
let the favorite skip right out in front.
Articulate kept him close company to the
stretch and there shot his bolt. By this
time O'Connor had brought Autolight into
play, and although the race was run just
right to suit the latter horse, which is a
slow beginner, Ordnung won by a length.
The going was sloppy and cut up in
places, and the time I:lsV* marks an ex
cellent performance. However, there still
exists a doubt as to the relative merits of
the two horses and they will probably
clash again. :
Four well backed favorites in The
Weaver, Urchin, Sol Lichtenstein and De
coy were bowled over. On paper the pro
gramme did not wear a very "classy"
look, but some extensive wagering was
indulged in.
The Weaver, a maiden 2-year-old owned
by Hugh Wilson, the Butte hotel man,
was made the medium of a huge plunge
in the opening scramble. From threes tne
price was gradually chopped to 8 to 5 and
the hot one lost the decision to Rameses
by a neck. No excuses could be offered
for The Weaver, as he was simply out
footed by Green Morris' colt, which was
excellently ridden by Birkenruth.
In the seven furlong run which fol
lowed all the starters carried their
weight and it wore a catch-as-catch-can
look. Urchin, with Bullman up, finally
closed favorite, only to be collared and
downed with consummate ease by Rose of
Hilo, a 10 to 1 shot, piloted by Ruiz.
Henry Spencer put old Cromwell over
the line first for the mile and a sixteenth
selling event. Ed Purser's horse came in
for plenty of support, going to the post a
3 to 2 favorite. To the splendid ride he
received more than to anything else can
be attributed his victory. Spencer al
lowed Ned Dennis, the dangerous looking
one, to go out with St. Anthony and then
cutting loose in the run home disposed
of Dennis by a length. O'Connor finished
third with Alicia.
Dr. Rowell's black youngster, Sol Lich
tenstein, was looked upon as a certainty
for the five furlong two-year-old sprint.
Birkenruth did not get him away from
the post in very good shape and Woods
on Botany led him from start to finish.
Phyllis ran a poor third.
The closing mile and a sixteenth proved
a difficult guessing problem. Decoy
seemed to catch the fancy of the book
makers and handicappers and was made
the favorite. Woods rated him and ran
unplaced. Duckoy, ridden by Bullman,
made nearly all the pace, and though
pressed hard at the end by Lodestar, won
by half a length.
I Track Notes.
The officials at Oakland stated yester
day that racing will be continued at the
track across the bay until after the first
of Â¦ the year.*.
Winslette was slightly injured in a mix
up at the post in the fifth event. : .
"Pi" Ruiz, it is said, has received an
offer to go to Australia and ride. Eddie
Ames, from recent accounts, is meeting
with marked success on the Island con
tinent.
Barney Schreiber. looking " hale and
hearty, arrived on last night's overland
from St. ' Louis. He will cut in at the
booking game next week. Barney says he
has a grand looking lot of yearlings by
Sain, Balgowan and Service at his "Wood
lands farm; far better than any of the
â¢yearlings he saw East, unless those of
the Keenes' be excepted. - As to the re
ports telegraphed here that he had signed
Dugan to do his riding Barriey said there
was no truth to it. He still has hope of
bringing Cochran out here, although some
sort of a controversy over a contract is
going on between the crack lightweight's
father and John McCafferty. i

BRYAN AND SOCIALISM.
MR. T. J. MORGAN, a leading socialist, re
cently declared the secret of the transforma
tion of the Democratic party in 1896, which
noed in 1900. He admits that the socialists cap
tured the parly to use it for their purposes and that
they recognize its declaration of principles as social
istic, and therefore find its use as an organization in
line with their work and deserving of their support.
The Chicago Chronicle, the only Democratic
paper in that city, takes this as confirmation of its
position against Bryan in 1896,- without, however,
stopping tc explain its support of him in 1900 upon
a platform still more socialistic.
The Chronicle now says that Bryan was used as
instrument by the socialists to capture the
Democratic party. It says: "Millions of Demo
crats voted for Bryan through the force of party
habit and with no idea of departing from well estab
lished Democratic principles, but the elements
which controlled these millions and which contrib
uted perhaps a few hundred thousand votes to the
cause were socialistic and in some cases anarchistic."
We reprint this with no desire to touch the ire
sprir.g of the Willows Journal and set it vibrating
again, but merely to quote in support of The Call's
opinion of Bryanism the most respectable Demo
cratic authority in the United States.
The Chronicle continues: "The free silver propa
ganda was popular with socialists and anarchists be
cause they perceived that it was an assault on many
forms of hoarded wealth, and their more numerous
dupes did not at once realize the fact that it was
equally menacing to the thrift}- man of small means
who was dependent on a fixed income. It was this
subtle attack upon wealth and credit which brought
into the campaign as Bryan's assistants all of the
flaming bigots, agitators and revolutionists from
Maine to Oregon and gave that alarming aspect to
the contest which has been described as the arrayal
of class against class. Left to themselves and oper
ating under their true colors the socialists could not
have made much impression upon political and busi
ness life. It was the Democratic name and organiza
tion, backed by millions of loyal but misguided Dem
ocrats, -which made the movement formidable."
This will make the steadfast gold Democrats
chortle, but will it influence the perverted organiza
tion of which Mr. Bryan is at once the life and the
death? Probably not, and for the reason that the
men who comn-ose it will control its next national
convention and will have to eat their last two plat
forms. The party will probably continue in its so-.
cialistic orbit, which carried it nearer the Presidency
in 1896 than ever again, and now is removing it
farther away until, like a comet, it will disappear in
space, and if it ever come back will probably come
with its socialistic tail amputated or worn off by the
nsk of wagging its body.
Ira recent address on "The Psychology of Fashion"
Professor Vincent of the University of Chicago said:
"The basis of fashion in this country is competitive
imitation. Every person, in whatever station of life,
but more particularly in the upper and middle classes,
attempts to outdo a neighbor in style of garments,
architecture or manners laid down by some leader.
The desire to be in fashion amounts to a positive de
termination to otitdo others, and this competitive
imitation amounts to a mad clambering up the rungs
be social ladder." It appears, then, that fashion
is just about as good an incentive to action as any
other. It keeps men moving.
German shipowners recently held a conference for
the purpose of devising ways- and means for counter
acting "the spread of American influence on the
ocean," and thus we have another proof that Uncle
Sam is getting there with both feet.
Every new report of the preparations King Ed
ward is making for his coronation is followed by a
rumor that his health is failing, and it seems to be
about even betting whether the grand ceremony will
turn out to be a coronation or a state funeral.
ELASTIC CURRENCY PLAN.
ADVICES from Washington are to the effect
that one of the first bills submitted to Con
gress when it assembles will be the Lovering
bill, reported at the last session by the House Com
mittee on Banking and Currency, and designed "to
make the currency responsive to the varying needs
of business at all seasons and in all sections." The
bill was carefully prepared by the committee last
winter, but was completed too late for action at that
session. It was reported, however, in order that it
might be brought before the public and discussed by
those interested during the vacation. The framers
are now sanguine it will be approved by the country
and they expect to submit it as soon as Congress or
ganizes and urge its immediate consideration.
The object of the bill is to give greater elasticity
to the circulation of national bank notes and to en
able the banks under suitable safeguards to expand
the amount of paper currency during the season
when the crops are being moved and at other times
when the business of the country demands it. The
operation of the bill is to be gradual, so as to permit
of something in the way of experimental stages be
fore the full amount of the ultimate expansion in
tended is to be permitted. Thus it is provided that
for a period of three years national banks are to be
permitted to issue unsecured notes to the extent of
10 per cent of their capital; that is, notes resting
upon the assets of the banks and not secured by de
posits of Government bonds. This issue is extended
after three years to 20 per cent, and after six years
to 40 per cent. If it should be found after three years
of experience that the results would justify the ex
tension, no further legislation would be necessary.
The phrase "unsecured notes" is a technical term,
used to distinguish the notes issued upon assets un
der the bill from those issued upon bonds. As a mat
ter of fact they are to be fully secured, for they are
to rest not only upon the assets of the bank but upon
a guarantee fund in the treasury, to which evtry bank
will contribute legal tender money equal to 5 per
cent of its issue. Moreover, all the unsecured notes
are taxed to the amount of 1 per cent per annum, and
the proceeds of the tax are added to the guarantee
fund. Finally, the notes are safeguarded by a further
provision that the Comptroller of the Currency shall
have the right to deny a bank the privilege of issuing
such notes if the general state of circulation or of
foreign exchanges lead him to deem such issue in
expedient.
It is believed the tax imposed upon the unsecured
notes will automatically lead to their retirement
whenever an excess of therh has been issued. Thus
they will be put into circulation only when the de
mand for currency raises the rates of interest suffi
ciently high to enable the banks to pay the tax with
out loss, and will be immediately withdrawn when
that condition changes.
The measure is so radically different from that
which prevails that it is sure to meet with a good
deal of opposition. It appears, however, to be the
best plan yet devised to attain the desired objects.
A currency more elastic than that which we now
possess has long been felt as one of the urgent needs
of our financial system. The new measure would
permit national banks in any important section of the
country to increase the amount of currency in circu
lation there at any time without having to go to the
expense of obtaining it from the great financial cen
ters. That in itself would be a considerable gain to
the business of the country. Unless, therefore, some
better plan can be suggested it will be well worth
while to give the Lovering bill a test. Congress has
been backing and filling over our currency problems
too long. It is time for action.
Right Hon. C. T. Ritchie, British Secretary of
State for Home Affairs, said in a recent speech:
'We desire a termination of hostilities so that Boer
and Briton can live together in amity and the same
extraordinary success which has attended British ad
ministration in Egypt would be repeated in South
Africa." It has evidently been a sad surprise to the
Ministry to find out that there is a big difference be
tween Boers and Egyptians.
GUESSING ON THE WAR.
SINCE the first outbreak of the war in South
Africa the British public has taken considerable
interest in guesses concerning its probable
duration. At first the men who made the guesses
were very sanguine that the war would not last six
months, then the guessers became dubious, and now
they hedge their guesses round with so many "ifs"
and "buts" that it is about as hard to guess what
they mean as it would be to form your own estimate
of the length of time the war is yet to run.
Recently the South African correspondent of the
London Mail furnished that paper with this interest
ing calculation on the subject:
What does the phrase "the end of the war" mean to
you? It means one or more of three things. It sigrni
fles in your mind either (1) the date on which the legal
ized killing: of men will cease in South Africa; (2) the
date on which some one who is near and dear to you
will be released from military service in South Africa,
or (3) the date on which it ceases to be necessary to
devote the funds of the nation to the upkeep of an
army in the field other than the garrisons usually em
ployed under ordinary peace conditions. And this is
my estimate of the periods Intervening between the
present date and the three "ends" of the war;
(1) Nine months the "flghtine end."
(2) Fourteen months the "military end."
(3) Two years the "financial end."
After making that estimate, which sounds like a
carefully digested calculation, the writer adds: "I
know that I err on the side of optimism." We have
therefore to make an allowance for the excess of
optimism before we can derive any satisfaction from
the calculation.
Another factor of confusion in the problem is the
recent letter of President Stein of Orange Free
State to Lord Kitchener, in the course of which he
says :
I also note that your Excellency takes it for granted
that our struggle is hopeless. I do not know on what
grounds your^Excellency bases this opinion, but let us
compare for a moment our mutual conditions at the
present time and a year ago, after the surrender of
General Prinsloo. A year ago, after General Prinsloo's
surrender, the Cape Colony was altogether peaceful and
free from, our commandos; the Orange Free State was
almost wholly In your hands, not only the principal
towns, railways and other villages, but also the whole
country, except where Commandant Haasbroek was
with his commandos. In the South African repub
lic It was the same; It was almost altogether in your
hands, except where General Delarey was with
his commandos, and where General Botha was with
his, far In the Boschveld. At present the Cape Colony
is, so to say, covered by our commandos, and they are
in temporary possession of the greater part of the Capo
Colony, where they move about as they wish and where
they are joined by many of our kindred and others,
who thus oppose themselves to the gToss injustice car
ried on against the republics. I willingly admit that In
the Orange Free State your Excellency is in possession
of the capital, the railway and a few villages not situ
ated on the railway line, but that is all that your Excel
lency possesses. The whole Orange Free State, with
the exception of the above, is in our possession.
In making that statement President Stein, like the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1901.
Mail correspondent, was erring on the side of optim
ism. He stated the case for the Boers somewhat
stronger than it is in fact, but none the less there is
so much truth in the statement that it must have
given Kitchener at least, fifteen minutes of disagree
able reflections. For a long time now the best the
British have been able to do has' been to capture a
few Boers here and there. Such a wearing down
process as that may be sure in the end, but it is
fearfully slow.
Under such conditions it is not surprising that
even the Briton who is generally most sure that
he knows it all hesitates to give an opinion as to
when the war will close and the fighting be finished.
"It may be for years and it may be forever" is
doubtless a familiar phrase in the British War Of
fice. As for the people generally they are not con
cerning themselves over such fine points as the fight
ing end, the military end and the financial end. All
they care to see is the end of anything that means
war.
After summing up the casualties of the deer-hunt
ing season, which has just closed, some New Yorkers
are in favor of having the game laws amended so as
to make it a misdemeanor to shoot a man by mistake
for a deer. The manslaughter practice, it appears, is
becoming too common for the good of the sport.
FOR the purpose of furnishing information perti
nent to the discussion of the reciprocity trea
ties now before the Senate, the Treasury Bu
reau of Statistics has compiled a concise statement
of all reciprocity agreements made by the United
States, including those now awaiting ratification. A
summary given to the press contains a review of the
reciprocity history of the country since 1850, and
shows that we have never given the policy any very
extensive operation.
â Since 1850 we have had reciprocity treaties with
Canada, Hawaii, Brazil, San Domingo, British West
Indies, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala,
Cuba and Porto Rico, Germany, Austria-Hungary
and Switzerland. All of those treaties have expired.
At present we have in operation reciprocity treaties
with France, Germany, Portugal and Italy. The eld
est of these is that with France, which was made in
1898; the others were made in 1900.
Of the treaties now under consideration the sum
mary says:
The pending unratifled treaties from which the in
junction of secrecy has been removed provide for:
First, the reduction of 12*Â£ per cent duty on sugar,
molasses, fruits and asphalt from the British West
Indies and Guiana, and the removal or reduction of the
duty on a large list of agricultural products and manu
factures entering those colonies from the United States;
second, a reduction of 20 per cent in the duty on sugar,
hides and certain grades of wool from Argentina enter
ing the United States, and a reductioH in the Argentina
duty on a large list of food stuffs and manufactures
from the United States; third, a reduction of from 5 to
20 per cent on certain manufactures entering the United
States from France, and the application of the mini
mum tariff of France to most of the articles entering
that country from the United States. In addition to
these there are pending treaties with Nicaragua, Ecua
dor, the Danish West Indies and the Dominican repub
lic, from which the injunction of secrecy has not as yet
been removed.
This concise presentation of the essential points
of all the proposed treaties from which the injunction
of secrecy has been removed will serve to confirm
the popular objection to the reciprocity policy. In
a country whose industries are so diverse as those of
the United States it is impossible to devise ways and
means for carrying out such a policy without injur
ing some interest for the purpose of benefiting
others. The only .reciprocity policy for which the
Republican party ever stood was one of providing
foreign markets for American products by admitting
to the American market foreign goods that
do not compete with home products. It is
now clear the advocates of reciprocity will
not be satisfied with that restriction. They de
mand the privilege of sacrificing some American
interest for the sake of getting foreign markets. Such
being the case, the whole scheme of reciprocity had
better be abandoned. There is not enough to be
gained by reciprocity to make it worth while for us
to make the slightest gap in the protective system.
The St. Louis woman who serii a turkey to her
sister stuffed with greenbacks has introduced a pleas

hesitate to ask for a liberal helping of the stuffing.
ONLY a short time ago it was announced that
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had placed
orders for rolling stock amounting in the
aggregate to more than $7,000,000. That was deemed
a very good evidence of the increasing business and
prosperity of the country, but now comes the an
nouncement that the Pennsylvania Railroad has
placed orders for equipments, mainly of locomotives
and freightcars, which will entail expenditures of
$26,000,000. Such an order from a single railroad cor
poration in a single season may well be admitted as
a convincing proof that the business of the country is
rising with remarkable rapidity and gives every assur
ance of continuing to rise for a long time to come.
It would be difficult to find a better index of the
trade of the country than the demand for railway
materials. When business is brisk there is a demand
for transportation facilities, and most of that demand
has to be met by railroads. To obtain their rails,
cars and locomotives it is necessary for them to
purchase liberally of the great iron and steel trades,
and that extends and augments industry. Thus the
roads not only receive from prosperity an increased
business, but they give business to others and help to
spread the prosperous condition of affairs wider yet.
It is stated that the order of the Pennsylvania
company includes 19,000 freight and coal cars and 400
locomotives, while the order of the Baltimore and
Ohio includes 1300 boxcars, 4000 steel hoppers, 700
flatcars and 6000 freightcars. That amount of rolling
stock would in itself be a good equipment for an ex
tensive railway system, and yet it represents the
orders for new stock given by but two corporations
of the country. Truly the nation is growing and it
takes a live railroad management to keep up with it.
It is gratifying to learn that J. Pierpont Morgan
has paid upward of $26,000 for a copy of a book
printed in 1495, for if the curio sellers can keep
bleeding him in that way he will never be able to
buy the earth and make the rest of us move off.

FAMOUS ACTOR WHO DELIGHTS
THE MATINEE GIRLS IN JAPAN
ICHIKAWA DANJURO WHO IS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE THE GREATEST ACTOR IN THE LAND OP THE MI
KADO, AND WHO CAN PROUDLY BOAST OF A LINE OF THEATRICAL ANCESTORS THAT REACHES
BACK SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS.
THE Jefferson family of actors, which for nearly one hun
dred and fifty years has been known both in England
and the United States, has its counterpart in Japan in
the Kikugoros and Danjuros. Onoye Kikugoro is the
fifth of that name, the founder of the family having
gone on the stage in 1735. Ichilcawa Danjuro, considered the
greatest living actor of Japan, can boast of a line of theatrical
ancestors that reaches back two hundred and twenty years.
Horikoshi Ebizo, the first of the Danjuros, was born in
ICGO of "poor but respectable parents." At the age of 14 he
assumed the stage name of Ichikawa Danjuro, and soon after
ward was acknowledged the leading actor of Yedo, as Tokio
was then called. He was murdered on the stage in 1704 by a
fellow player, with whom he had remonstrated on h'.s licen
tious life. His son Kuzo, who was born in 1688, succeeded to
the stage name, which he maintained in high repute until his
death in 1755. Kuzo made a journey in his youth to the shrines
of Narita, some forty miles east of Yedo, where he invoked
the god to aid him in his art, and when he afterward became
a famous actor he took In gratitude the name Xarita-ya as iWj
trade name Every actor in Japan has since then had three
separate namesâ his private name, which seldom becomes pub
lic- his Â«taÂ«?e name, by which he is always known, and his
trade name, which distinguishes his branch from others of the
same professional family.

The second bearer of the Danjuro name, being childless,
adopted a son, to whom he gave his own name. The youns
man died before him, and he thereupon adopted another, the
fourth Danjuro (1711-88), who was succeeded by his son, the
fifth of that name (1741-1806). The sixth (1788-99), also dying
before his father, whose name had been transmitted to him
in 1790, his nephew (1790-95) Inherited the coveted name. He \a
said to have been the ablest of the Danjuros. Hi 9 son OHM 4
committed suicide to save his father from reproach, and the
name remained in abeyance for nineteen years, until it was
assumed, in 1873, by his half-brother, who was born in 183 S.
The present Danjuro, the ninth of his name. Is, therefor-*

Takeda Izumo, which has for its subject the revenge of their
chieftain's death by forty-seven retainers, and which to this
day remains a stock play, sure to draw full houses when all
others have failed. Danjuro has played the part no less than
seventy-eight times, a fact which may not impress an Ameri
can public, accustomed to hupdred-nigfht runs, but which in
Japan, where audiences still demand variety and would recent

due there from New York in a day or two
and will be ready to sail for home in
about ten days.
The Kilpatrick belongs to the New York
line, but if Governor laft desires to come
by Honolulu and does not care to go to
New York, the Kilpatrick will be ordered
to San. Francisco. If the Governor does

GREAT MANUFACTURING Â»
PROJECT FOR STJISTJ2T
Production of Portland Cement to Go
Forward on an Extensive
Scale.
SUISUN, Nov. 29.â The Pacific Portland
Cement Company has purchased the prop
erty of the Eureka Portland Cement
Company, recently bought from A. A.
Dickie, and the latter company will now
build a cement factory here. The price
paid was ?47,500, and the deal was closed
last Monday. The Pacific Company will
immediately proceed to double the capa
city of the mills now under construction,
making them capable of producing from
1500 to l>*o barrels of cement daily. Man
ager Kind is confident that they will be
ready to commence the manufacture of
Portland cement by the latter part of
February.
A grade has been built and ties have
been laid for two miles of railway to con
nect the works with the line of the
Southern Pacific Company. Ten carloads
of heavy machinery have been received
from the East and Germany. The mag
nitude of the enterprise can be seen since
the cement foundation? for the buildings
have been laid. They cover several acres
of ground on a hillside and are to be
connected together and with the quarry
by a system of tramways. An electric
line will be constructed to connect the
works with the line of the Bay Counties
Power Company, two miles distant. l"n
ward of 300 men will be employed when
the factories are completed.

THREE BIG OCEAN LINERS DEPART
IN COMPANY FOR SOUTHERN SEAS
Palena for South America Carries Many Cabin Passengers and
Australia for Tahiti Has a Fair List, but the San Bias Leaves
Aimost Bare-â Steamships in a Heavy Storm Off the Coast
THE STEAMSHIPS SAN BLAS, PALENA AND AUSTRALIA DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN SEAS. THE
BAR WAS BREAKING AND THEIR PASSENGERS MUST HAVE HAD A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TIME
WHILE THE VESSELS WERE PASSING OUT.
HREE big ocean steamships
sailed for the southern seas at
noon yesterday.
IL The Australia was to have got
away at 10 a. m. for Tahiti, but
owing to some trouble in the engine room
it was miuday before she left her berth.
The San Bias got away on time for
Panama, while the Palena was a few min
utes late in leaving- for South America.
The three vessels passed out about the
same time, however. The bar could not
be seen, but it was breaking on the Po
tato Patch, so the chances are that a
lively southeaster was blowing outside.
There was a large crowd down to see
the "Palena away. The South American
liner was well patronized, and some of
the passengers had a luncheon party
aboard Captain Moon held the vessel a
few minutes to accommodate them.
Among those who went away on the
steamship were:
Mrs. G. E. Ward, Miss Mary Ward, Miss
Mabel Ward. Louis Carissimi, Rafael San
hucza Lizardi, F. Walton, Mrs. F. Walton,
Mary Grimm, Franceses, I'llos, J. Grijoloa,

Among those who sailed for Tahiti on
the Australia were E. E. McCartney, Mrs.
Samuel McCartney, E. H. Fritch, Mrs. L,.
Gooding and child, M. T. Brander and A.
Searle. Besides these she took away
eleven steerage passengers and two in the
second cabin.
There were no cabin passengers on the
San Bias, and she had but a light cargo.
There were over sixty second cabin and
steerage passengers, however, and a num
ber of Asiatics bound for Panama,
STORM-TOSSED VESSELS.
Eureka and Walla Walla Arrive
After Battle With the Elements.
The Pacific Coast Company's Walla
Walla and the Humboldt River steamship
Eureka arrived yesterday, both a day
behind time. The Walla Walla was sched
uled to arrive from the Sound Thanks
giving morning, but she was caught in
the southeaster, and Captain Hall had to
heave to off Mendocino. At that time the
waves were running mountains high.
About the same time the Eureka came
out over the Humboldt bar, and Captain
Jessen at once prepared for a stormy
trip. It was the first gale of the season
and was piping along af a GO-mile an hour
gait. The Eureka also was hove to, and
it was nearly a day before the vessel
could get under way and start for San
Francisco.
The Eureka and the Wal'.a Walla made
San Francisco about the same time.
On the bay there was no trouble, but
the captains and weather prophets are
expecting a gale to-night.
Accused of a Mean Swindle.
Y.'illiam Ross, a lad about 18 years old,
v,as arrested by the Harbor police yes
terday on a charge of swindling. He
passes himself off as a collector for a
syndicate that is to give the newsboys
and bootblacks of San Francisco a free
Christmas dinner. Among those whom
he "worked" were the Alaska Commer
cial Company, the Risdon Iron Workn,
Levi Btrauss, Daniel Meyer, Jeremiah
Daley. Miller, Sloss & Scott and Sig
Greenebaum. Ross' books showed that
ho had secured $235. but all of this
amount he claimed had been turned over
to one Samuels, who lives at the Occi
dental Hotel. Inquiries at the hostelry
failed to show any trace of the man who
heid the cash, so Ross was charged by
Captain Dunleavy with swindling. *

This. Course la from the Pea of the Weil â¢
Known Authority, tieorgo H. Powell.
[From "Success."]
Mr. Powell, who furnishes the matter
for the entire series, is a man of untiring
energy and enthusiasm, having: devoted
his entire life to the practical, theoretical
and artistic study of the subject. He is
conversant with the most successful
methods employed in the production of
effective advertisements, booklets and
auxiliaries which are of value in secur-
ing that most desirable element knowa as
publicity. ' A
Mr. Powell is to-day considered, by
those best competent to judge as one of
the most â¢ skillful planners and writers of
advertising in America. Some of his
achievements are . notable.
Entering the field in 1891, he quickly
revolutionized bicycle advertising and set
a pace that was never equaled. Later he
astonished patent medicine men by dem-
onstrating his ability to float a new arti-
cle and make it highly profitable the first
month. â¢
Next came Mr. Powell's work in build-
ing up the advertising department of one
of the largest woman's publications In
America, and in a year his methods added
nearly $50,000 worth of extra business, be-

WILL RELIEVE
STRANDED MEN
Government Prepares to
Send McCulloch to
Unalaska.
The United States Government is pre
paring: to send relief to the 115 Nome
miners who are reported to be stranded
at Unalaska. Captain liealy of the rev
enue cutter service has received instruc
tions to hold himself in readiness to pro
ceed at once to the far north in com
mand of the McCulloch. The McCulloch
is conditioned fur the trip and the Gov
ernment is . only awaiting more specific
inlormation concerning the strandea crew
of the Ralph J. Long before dispatching
the cutter un the mission of relief..
Captain Healy. when seen last night,
said that he does not think the miners
are in pressing danger of suffering from
lack ol provisions, as both the Alaska
and the North American Commercial
companies have provision stores at Una
laska. The men are destitute, but the
companies will undoubtedly give them suf
ficient food to tide them over until relief
arrives. Besides the stranded miners
there are lifteen white men and about 150
natives in Unalaska. Tne food supply,
according to Captain Healy. is sufficient
to sustain the white men and natives
three months.
Thomas 1. Drury of this city was among
the passengers on the Ralph J. Long. In
a letter which he wrote to his wife from
the Alaska Commercial Company's store
in Unalaska he stated that the owner of
the schooner had deserted ,his passengers
and crew, leaving them without food or
water and with no money, with which to
purchase these necessities. Drury stated
that he was working his way down.
Captain Healy, in accordance with in
structions issued by Chief of the Revenue
Cutter Service Charles F. Shoemaker, has
been making an investigation as to the
circumstances which led to the stranding
of the passengers and crew .of the Ralph
J. Long. " The captain learned that among
the list of passengers were many disrepu
table characters, the riffraff of the Nome
miners. They were men who had failed
to make a strike and had become desti
tute in Nome without the means of re
turning to their homes. They secured the
schooner Ralph J. Long, but their means
gave out before the boat had been prop
erly provisioned. Having put to sea in a
boat without i- sufficient food to sustain
them until they reached Seattle, they were
forced to disembark at Unalaska.
When the men landed at Unalaska the
two commercial companies began to fear
for the safety of their property. They did
not relish the idea of 150 men without
means of support and without restraint
Turned loose on the island with their un
protected property. The companies raised
S3OO to enable the stranded miners to con
tinue their journey, but the men evidently
considered the contribution insufficient to
last them until they could reach a home
port. At any rate they remained at Una
laska and the companies are supposed to
have made an appeal to the Government
for assistance.
Hitherto it has been the policy of the
Government to retain at least one revenue
cutter in the Alaskan waters until the
last commercial vessel left the north. But
this year the cutters were recalled unusu
ally early. Tt will require ten days for
the McCulloch to reach Unalaska.

RUMORS OF WAR
AMONG BOSSES
Herrin's Henchmen Cast
Ugly Slurs on
Burns.
Boss Martin Kelly is quoted as saying:
"Crimmins is receiving a salary from
Herrin to play policeman and watch me."
At Kelly's headquarters the other night,
on the occasion of the dedication of his
newly equipped apartments, there was a
deal of oratory. Ex-Senator Morehouse
electrified the audience with an anti-Her
rin speech, and there was considerable
anti-Gage talk. There is an impression
that some aspirant for the office of Gov
ernor is in the background and secretly
contributing the coin to enable Boss
Kelly to make a splurge so early in the
campaign. Kelly's old running mate ,Sam
Rainey. was not among the statesmen
present at the dedication.
The reiterated reports of a falling out
among The local bosses should not be ac
cepted as a. true index of dissensions in
the boss camp. It is true enough, how
ever, that politicians who are close to
Gage and Herrin say that Burns is too
big a load for the Governor to carry in
the next campaign. The question is
asked: "Did the colonel ever win a
fight?" It is surmised that Herrin is try
ing to throw the responsibility for the
recent wreck of the Gage machine on
Burns. The henchmen of the "colonel "
readily ascribe the disaster to the clumsy
politics of Herrin. Martin Kelly asserts
that he advised both of them against the
nomination of Wells.
Cator Was Favored for Office.
The story is corroborated that Herrin
and Dibble favored Cator, while Burns
and Goldberg declared for Wells. John
C. Lynch suggested C. A. Murdock as a
compromise candidate, but Burns re
plied that "Murdock was an impossi
bility."
The bosses may be quarreling among
themselves now% but the cohesive power
of political patronage will probably unite
them for the machine candidate before th
next primary election takes place. The
independent anti-boss Republicans should
lose no time in organizing their forces in
every district of the city. The voters
should not be placed in trie awkward po
sition of being compelled to vote for
Boss Kelly's delegates in order to escape
the greater disgrace of permitting the
election of Boss Herrin's creatures. The
chances are tv/o to one that Kelly, Crim
mins. Herrin, Burns, Lynch, Dibble and
Rainey will come together to oppose the
forces of clean government; hence it is
essential that organization of the best
elements of the party should not be neg
lected.
Champions of the Wage-Earner.
The Democrats are beginning to appre
hend that the Ti-age-earners of California
are in a deplorable condition. Mayor Sny
der of Los Angeles, Dick Beamer of
Woodland. Washington Dodge of San
Francisco and Thomas J. Geary of Santa
Rosa are paraded as champions of the
toiling masses. Beamer is the Marysville
Democrat's candidate for Governor." That
paper remarks:
"Men who are in position to judge of
the feeling among labor organizations say
Beamer can secure the indorsement of the
lapor party in San Francisco."
This comment signifies that Dick
Beamer is next to Jack Parry.
Mayor Snyder is the gubernatorial can
didate of Southern California Democrats.
Washington Dodge is Gavin McNab's
choice for Governor, and Thomas J.
Geary is the Examiner's Democratic can
didate. Each aspirant is willing to wear
the union label in some- conspicuous place
at all hours of the day and night.
The Berkeley Gazette asserts that the
anti-Chinese convention was used by de
signing Democratic politicians and a yel
low newspaper to further their ambition,
and adds that "a good cause should not
be made a packhorse for office-seekers."
Would Wear the Union Label.
It happened fortunately that the Demo
cratic jugglery of the convention was so
clumsily done by the manipulators that
the people who were observing the show
were not deceived. The raw work of put
ting on the committee of five a yellow
press representative and three sandwich
Democrats, rendered the proceedings gro
tesque.
W. H. Pratt, formerly of Humboldt
County, who was United States Surveyor
General lor the district of California dur
ing the administration of President Har
rison, is mentioned as a proper man to
fill the vacancy in the office caused by the
death of John M. Gleaves.
To-I>ay's News Letter.
The Looker On tells amusingly in to
day's News Letter of the struggle among
the beaux for the place of honor at the
side of charming little Fritzi Scheff, the
opera singer, and also has a hitherto un
published story of Mr. Rudyard Kip
ling's experiences in San Francisco. Edi
torially it still maintains^ts view on the
desirability of Chinese Emigration, and
gives our representatives some wholesome
advice as to how they should proceed to
gain from the Government the appropri
ations we nf>ed for irrigation purposes.
There is a very entertaining article by
Mr. Ben C. Truman on the "Romance of
Benedictine." There are a new lot of
"limericks" this week, and the insurance
and other departments are well filled with
entertaining, authentic matter. The
Town Crier lashes right and left with a
vigor that fills the hearts of many wrong
doers with dismay. Â»

Audience at Ellis-Street
Clubrooms.
The members of the Press Club endeav

Grau Opera Company in an informal way

Blass sang. The large number of mem
bers gathered in the jinks room realized

Two Grenadiers" and a drinking songâ
his rendition of both being superb.
Nathan Landsberger, the Press Club
violinist, earned the thanks of his audi
ence by his skillful playing on the instru
ment of the masters, and the singing of
Mr. Muhlmann, barytone of the Grau
Opera Company, was heartily applauded.
Both of the operatic stars were accom

pany.
"Uncle" George Bromley, on behalf of
the club, thanked the singers for their
efforts, in a speech witty as only the

of the Yon Yonson Company delivered
some of his inimitable dialect stories,
and Mr. Holland's clever impersonations
pleased the gathering. Captain Leale
contributed some humorous stories.

FEDERAL GRAND JURY
AGAIN AFTER DIMMICK
Secret Service Agent Burns Thought
to Have, Evidence Sufficient to
Convict Him.
A Federal Grand Jury was impaneled
yesterday by United States District Judge
de Haven, the following citizens having
been selected to serve for the ensuing
term:
W. E. Lutz, M. U. Bates, John G. Us, Charles
M. Plum, Joseph C. Sala. Edward J. Luhman.
John H. Bullock. Austin H. Hill, James M.
Hlllman, W. 3. Hynes, W. C. Hayes, S. C.
Wallis, W. B. Hunt. E. L. Wadham, B. Bangs
Eugene A. Bresse D. J. Sullivan, F. E. Zeig
ler, G. H. Davis, C. Q. Stewart, J. W. Varney,
A. M. Davis and A. D. Carvill.
The jurors elected Charles M. Plum
foreman, and immediately proceeded to
the consideration of several petty smug
gling cases.
The charge against Walter N. Dimmick
of having stolen $30,000 from the Mint
will be investigated after December 6,
on which date Secret Service Agent W.
J. Burns is expected to arrive. Burns is
the most important witness for the Gov
ernment, being in possession of evidence
which is relied upon by the United States
District Attorney to convict the accused.
One of the strong points of the prosecu
tion is the fact that Dimmick was seen
several times leaving the Mint building
with a dressing case in his hand.

lace, extended a hearty welcome to her
visitors and she readily consented to dis
cuss the many rumors that have been
in the public mind concerning her.
With flashing eyes and in scornful tones
she denounced the stories that had been
spread broadcast that she was suffering
from cancer of the throat or that she had
been obliged to rest on account of over
indulgence in sparkling wine.
She spoke rapidly in French, and once
in a while would indulge in a few word 3
of English.
"It is malicious, it is cruel," cried
Calve, "when people say that I have can
cer of the throat. Oh, the vile insults I
have read in some of the papers. You, in
America, treat women as queens, yet this
is the only country In the world where I
have been so insulted. They say I can
not sing this season. I have come back
to_pro_ve it is false. Listen to my voice."
The diva rushed to the piano and strik
ing a note, started to sing the scale and
her glorious voice soared upward, sound
ing as clear as a bell.
"I will sing to-morrow night in 'Car
men,' " continued Calve, "but the people
shall not say, 'Oh, the poor woman, she
has cancer,' or 'poor Calve, she Is tired
out." It is all lies, lies, lies.
"I had a cold and went to Pasadena to
rest. Then they started these infamous
stories about me. In justice to Mr. Grau
and to the people of San Francisco, I
have come back here to sing. I did feel
like going back to France, where I should
not be so cruelly insulted. Who is it that
dares to say that I drink too much liquor.
It is a coward who stabs at a woman,
who cannot go out and defend herself.
They have said the worst things of me,
physically and morally. What more can
tney say."
When it was suggested to the diva that
perhaps rumor might say that she was in
love, she broke out into a hearty laugh
and answered:
"Perhaps yes, perhaps no."
Calve assured Manager Grau and the
representative of The Call that she was
in splendid voice and would positively
sing to-night in "Carmen."
If Calve displays as much passion to
night as Carmen as she did yesterday
afternoon, her audience will witness one
of the greatest performances seen during
tne present grand opera season.

OUR MINERALS
State Mineralogist Is to
Issue an Important
Bulletin.
State Mineralogist Aubury proposes Is
suing a bulletin of the structural mater
ials and industrial minerals of California.
In carrying out his plan of publishing
separate bulletins of the several and
varied mineral resources of the State Mr.
Aubury has recognized the importance of
these industriesâ an importance that has
been overshadowed in the past by the at
tractions to gold, copper and petroleum
resources anu products. The structural
materials and industrial minerals in 1000
amounted to $4,080,240, or 12Â»s per cent cf
the entire mineral output of the Stare,
approaching -within about $6110,000 of the
copper production and only a quarter of
a million dollars below the valne of the
petroleum.
In the statistical bulletins issued by the
State Mining Bureau the structural ma
terials and industrial minerals are so
placed in their order that their Important
segregation from the staple (or indepen
dent) minerals is not apparent. But tnere
is no other proper (or scientific) method
of presenting such statistics; and thus tre
relative value of these materials and min
erals forming essentials in structure anJ
manufacture, in comparison with gold,
silver, copper, quicksilver, lead, coal,
mineral waters, salt, natural gas and pe
troleum, has never been presented in a
way to attract attention.
It has been known in a general way
that California produces certain materials
and minerals; but even the persons inter
ested in the building trades and the
manufactures are not fully aware of the
possibilities of California in these re
sources. So Mr. Aubury proposes to mako
plain not only to them that are interested,
but to all that care to read, the splendid
showing this State canâ and doesâ make
in the production of the following named
structural materials and industrial min
erals:
Clay, cement, sandstone, granite, lime,
limestone, macadam, rubble, paving
blocks, serpentine, marble, quartz sar.d,
glass 'sand, slate, antimony, mineral
paint, manganese, chrome, borax, fulicis'
earth, asbestos, gypsum, pyrites, tourma
line, quartz crystals, lithia, mica, soda,
magnesite. turquoise, asphaltum and bi
tuminous rock.
The relative value and importance of
the three classes of mineral products of
the State have never been so clearly Hot
forth as they will be by the several bul
letins in process of preparation and publi
cation by the -State Mining Bureau. The
mineral products of 1900, as presented by
the statistical bulletin, when segre
gated from their mineralogieal order
and placed in their commercial reia
tlon, show that of the State's total
mineral product the staple minerals pro
duced a value of $28,542,705; industrial min
erals, $1,506,163; structural materials, $2.
574,077. So it is shown that the combined
structural materials and industrial min
eralsârepresenting 12^ per cent of tl\e
whole â are worthy tlte issuance of the
special bulletin proposed by Mr. Aubury.
That a clearer Idea of the importance of
these industries may be now presented
than has been heretofore, a list of struc
tural and industrial products, their value
and the names of the counties producing
them has been carefully compiled. The
materials mentioned include all that have
for two years been recorded by the sta
tistician of the State Mining Bureau; the
ADVERTISEMENTS.

POLICE EXPECT
MORE TROUBLE
Rival Highbinder Tongs
Prepare to Do More
Shooting.
The tragedies that marked the passing
of Thanksgiving day in Chinato-wn and
that heralded the opening of a fierce high
binder war became the subject of 3erioii3
consideration on the part of the Mongo
lian inhabitants yesterday. Regret tnat
the pop of revolvers disturbed the peace
of the colony seemed to generally prevail,
except among the members of the tonga
directly involved. Pressure is being
brought to bear from many sources to
prevent a renewal of the hostilities.
Yesterday every commercial body,
every family and every tons: in China
town except the two whose hatchetmen
prowled about the streets in quest of vic
tims swore to strictly observe the law.
They posted flaming entreaties in
spicuous places urging their coun.rymen
not to anger Congress, which will shortly
pass on the exclusion act.
The Ping Kong Tong and the Hip Yins
Tong, the belligerent factions, insist upon
settling their trouble by their own pecu
liar methods, exclusion or no exclusion.
They have decided to disregard the warn
ing of their fellow countrymen and con
tinue the fight. The Six Companies, the
most representative commercial body in
the district, summoned the leaders of
each faction before it, that a means of
peace might be discussed. The fighting
tongs displayed their resentment at this
attempt to interfere by ignoring the sum
mons. The officers of the companies say
they will step the war, and without the
shedding of blood. They have called for
the assistance of all clans, tongs and fac
tions. The response has been a heart/
one and if the influence of over nine
tenths of the Chinese population couno
for aught further trouble may be avoided.
Loo Fook pawned a bracelet belonging
to a Chinese woman for $36 and then sent
her the ticket. That was the beginning
of the present trouble. The Hip Ying
tong acted for the woman, and after sev
eral meetings decided that Loo Fook was
a bad man, and offered 1500 to the
hatchetman who would send him in a box
to the Coroner. Fook, knowing that he
was in bad standing, and that $s<)o waa
a big inducement to the highbinders, pro
vided himself with a guard. Both he and
the guard fell, despite their precaution.
The Ping Kong tong. to whifh Fook haÂ»
contributed, was swift in dealing out ret
ribution, for two hours later Chung Keon
and Quong Bing Wai were shot dead as
they dreamed in "poppy" slumber in a
house at Clay and Stockton streets.
Neither Fook nor his bodyguard will
die. according to the surgeons at the Re
ceiving Hospital. The two Hip Ying men
having claimed the attention of an under
dertaker, the latter tong feels the ne
ty of doing some pretty accurate snooting
in th 4 near future t i even up the scor>\
The Ping Kong tong, knowing of its
rival's intentions, is still on the man hunt
that it may keep ahead in the score
The meeting of the Six Companies ad
journed at midnight without accomplish
ing anything. Information was conveyed
to the police that the rival tongs wera
preparing for a pitched battle, but the lo
cation of the prospective battle-ground
is not known. In consequence Sergeant
Conboy and his squad was instruo"
remain until a late hour, and an
force of uniformed officers was sent into
Chinatown.DEATHS LIST
FULL OF ERROR
Wabash Conductor Says
He Cannot Number
Victims.
Explanation of the Cause of
Disaster Told to
Coroner.
ADRIAN. Mich.. Nov. 29.â Just before
the Coroner's inquest in the Wabash
Railroad wreck adjourned late to-day
Conductor Trowl of the ill-fated No. 13
train testified as to the number of per
sons who were on that train. According
to his statement, there were 190 passen
gers on board.
Wbea he was ordered to meet No. 4 he
was at Holloway and received his order
from Operator Martin Dale. He read tae
order in the presence of the operator and
took three copies, giving two to the tiro
engineers of his train and retaining one
himself. The engineer of engine 151 re
ceived the orders. In each instance when
the order was delivered by him the tirc
mtn -was present. He understood the
train was to sidetrack at Seneca for No. 4.
If the train had passed Seneca he would
have set the automatic brakes. Had the
s been set it would have required
one-eighth of a mile to stop the train.
He had no warning that anything was
wrong until he felt the shock. At that
time he was seated in the rear coach.
AVhen he had got out fire had started
in the head coach and other persons were
busy getting the injured out of the
wreck. He hurried down the track to
Sand Creek to get the engine of No. 3 to
pull away what cars could be saved and
three sleepers were '.auled away.
Conductor Trowl then came to his esti
mate of the number on the train.
"How many had you?' was asked.
"One hundred and ninety." was the re
piy. "1 don't know how many immi
grants. AYe had ISI passengers out of
Detroit. 1 get my figures from the col
lector on the train. 1 made a list of as
many as 1 could find who were saved. I
got the names of eighty-six. My collector
and I were together getting the list. A
number of passengers got away whose
names I did not get. Aside from this rec
ord. I have no means of knowing how
many were killed."
"What is your judgment as to the num
ber killed? " he was asked.
"I would not say. I can't tell. I could
Dot make any estimate."
Train Dispatcher Harvey O. Mann of
Montpelier testified as to the sending of
the order to train No. 4 to pass No. 13 at
Seneca. The operator at Montpelier, who
copied the order and gave it to Conductor
Martin, testified as follows:
"Conductor Martin read the order to
me aloud distinctly and then signed it,
and after repeating his signature to the
dispatcher I delivered him his two copies."
The inquest was adjourned until Tues
day next.
EIGHTY LIVES ARE LOST.
Detroit Official Speaks of the Cra^h
of the Trains.
DETROIT. Nov. 30.â An interview this
morning with Thomas E. Moran, Deputy
Customs Collector at this port, practical
ly verifies the estimate that at least
eighty lives were lost in Wednesday
night's wreck on the "Wabash near Sen
eca. The two immigrant cars in which
the greatest loss of life occurred and in
Â¦which so many of the wreck victims
roasted to death were part of train
.ich crossed the Detroit River
Canada on the ferry boat Great
"Western Wednesday afternoon. Deputy
inspected the baggage of its pas
Â¦ tigers. He says there were at the very
'Â¦alculation one hundred itHians in
Urn smoking car, which was ahead of the
Â¦^migrant cars.
Official advices to Superintendent Burns
of this division of the Wabash say that
of the Italians in the wreck twenty es
caped unhurt, and were taken to St.
Louis, fifteen are in the company's hos
at Peru. Inu.."six ethers are in Peru
and six are near Adrian, injured. Sub
tracting these forty-three from the 110
immigrants Deputy Moran say^ were
aboard the train, leaves a loss among the
Italians alone of sftcty-seven. In addi
tion eight other bodies were recovered
and identified, which makes a total of
Bfcventv-five dead.
"The first car of train No. 13 as it
crossed on the ferry." said Moran, "was
a combination baggage and smoker.
There were about ten liaiians .in this
car, for 1 remember that they motioned
to the next car back when I endeavored
to find their baggage. The first immi
grant coach was well filled, probably for
ty people occupying it. The smoking
compartment of this coach was filled
from flror to ceiling with the baggage of
-.migrants. It hs.d al! come through
~:a in bond, so I did not examine it.
"The second coach was completely filled
with passengers, my recollection being
that there was not a vacant seat in the
far, even the smoking room being crowd
ed. I should say that there were sixty
passengers in the coach. The men were
typical Italian workmen. There were
about a dozen women in the two cars
and half that number of children. As I
worked through the train I noticed that
there were six or seven Italians In the
chair car that was the fifth car of the
train. They did not seem to be members
of the party of immigrants."
Superintendent Burns insisted that the
death loss in the wreck near Seneca Wed
nesday night was being estimated too
high.
"Our attorney. Winston." said he. "has
telegraphed to New York for a complete
list of the immigrants that were on train
No. ]3 anu when it is received, which will
probably be to-morrow, an official state
ment will he issued by the road. As near
ar. e=timate now there are twenty
twn dead Wp have eight identified bodies
POSTUM CEREAL.
TAKE A RECORD.
See How Many Friends Are Hurt by
Coffee.
It would be just as reasonable for a
temperance advocate to drink a little di-
luted whiskey ac to drink coffee, for one
is as truly an intoxicant as the other, and
jrrsistence In the use of coffee brings on
Â¦ variety of chronic diseases, notorious
among: which are dyspepsia, heart palpita-
tion <and ultimately heart failure), fre-
quently constipation, kidney diseases,
maay cases of weak eyes and trembling
'- condition cf the nerves.
This is only a small percentage of the
variety of diseases which come from
balanced rtvvous system, caused by
. < rsistent daily use of the drug caf-
which is the active principle of cof-
fee. Another bit of prima facie evidence
ab"out coffee Is that the victims to the
|Â»bn find great difficulty In giving it up.
They will solemnly pledge to them-
aÂ»lves day after day that they will aban-
don the use of it when they know that it
If shortening their days, but morning af-
t*>r rooming they fail, until they grow to
Â«espiee themselves for their lack of con-
trol.
Any one interested in this subject
would be greatly surprised to make a sys-
tematic inquiry among prominent brain
workers in America. There are hun-
dreds of thousands of our most prominent
people that have abandoned coffee aJto-
â¢ and are using Postum Food Cof-
f"<= 1n its place, and for the most excellent
reasons in the world. Many of them
testify that ill health, nervous prostration,
and consequent inability to work, has in
past pushed them back and out of
f ; roper standing in life, which they
" have been able to regain by the use of
good health, strong nerves and great
vitality, since coffee has been thrown out
and the PoÃtum $Â»â¢ in itÂ« place.
MADAME EAMES SINGS "AIDA"
AND CAUSES PERFECT FURORE
The Verdi Opera Is
Given With
Spirit.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
LAST night's magnificent perform
ance of "Aida" at the Grand
Opera-house certainly failed to sat
isfy at least one member of the
enthusiastic audience. General
' Shatter confesses to a mad passion for
the music-drama for reasons as legiti
mate as they are convincing, and last
night's "Aida" fell deplorably short of
the brave warriors exalted ideal.
"Wagner for me," he said the other
! evening, with all the fuil-browed pro
i funditv of the perfect Wagnerite. "There
Â¦is no one but Wagner. Why, sir, I can
i go to sleep anywhere in the opera and
; find them at the same identical place
when I wake hd!"
"Aida" is not builded that way, and was
sung and applauded last night in a fasn
ion to wake the musical dead. It was
Eames' reappearance after her recent cold
and she was welcomed most royally. Tsat
urally the first thought was of her voice,
had she fully recovered its use? It
seemed so for almost three acts, though
she was appreciably careful of her fortes,
and thenâ O the pity of It', the voice broke
on one note in the Nile scene. But the
singer, with a courage and capacity that
' cannot be too much admired, went on
with the song and took the same passage
again with victorious voice. It was for all
the world like the note of a wounded bird,
and the sympathy of the whole house
went out in fullest measure to the brave
singer. It was the sympathy that counted
as largely in the applause as the tribute
to the artistic excellence of her work, and
the enthusiasm that followed the scene
; was another "unprecedented" event in
; the season's chronicle.
Mme. Eames was as usual a beautiful
picture, with her rose-gold flesh and bar
'Â¦ baric beauty of costume, every line and
! color of it just where and what it should
Â¦be We have had a dreary and comic pro
cession of Aidas here, from the Lucrezia
Borgia malce-up of Nordica in the part
lpst year to the brown bust and white
arms of Anna Lichter in the role at the
: Tivoli. Others resemble the wooden In
'Â¦ dian maids of the tobacconist stand,
i and others again, like Tavary, resemble
! nothing ever seen on the earth or in the
waters under the earth. But Mme. Eames
' satisfied utterly the sense of sight, just as
'< she satisfied one vocally. But she should
and must be heard again when she has
i the full strength of her voice. It was
j felt, in spite of the commanding beauty
of her work, that more power was needed
! sometimes.
It is a tender and womanly conception
of the character that Eames has, lacking
a little the barbaric strain that one
! rather looks for in Aida; but a winning
j and beautiful interpretation, nevertheless,
I and Mme. Eames ranks now with the
I singers who are first in the affections of
! the opera-loving folk here.
De Marchi was the Radames of the cast
! and again impressed with his exceptional
voice. He acts little yetâ but acts that
I little wellâ but he has a voice that is
i great now, and is some day going to be
]of the greatest. It lacks all sorts of
i ways yet, In smoothness, roundness,
I evenness, control generally. It is angu
i lar like his acting, buf he has every
necessary natural equipmentâ the sym
pathy, range, power and qualityâ and
last night in the concerted work with tfie
chorus the voice rang out clear and bril
liant with all-pervasive spell. He was
vocally very effective in the Nile scene,
and it only remains to wait so far as this
singer is concerned.
Scotti was a splendid Amonasro, his
virile notes and fervor filling in the por
trait with a barbaric strength that came
near the unforgotten excellencies of Sa
lassa's conception of the role. But Scotti
himself does not quite touch Salassa here,
though his is the younger voice by many
years. Still it is a conception to evoke
and we believe that the fragments found
represent fourteen other bodies."
Superintendent Burns was told of the
interview with Customs Collector Moran,
estimating the number of immigrants on
the train at 110. While he declined to esti
mate the number pending arrival of the
official list he declared that this was
too high. .
Dr. L. J. Goux, a well-known physician
of this city, who was in one of the rear
cars of the train, said to a reporter:
"I am willing to take an oath to the
effect that there were from 100 to 125 of
the immigrants in the forward coaches."
Dr. S. E. Bryant of the Emergency
Hospital in this city, who was one of the
corps of physicians, says H Is his opinion
that over 100 persons were killed in the
wreck.
Frank H. Wilson of Boston, when in
terviewed In Detroit, said: "When we
left Seneca there were about fifty persons
dead and as many more in the wreck."
Address by Astronomer Perrine.

Mr. Journet was effective as Ramfis, and
Mr. Muhlmann as the King.
The Amneris is one of Louise Homer's
opportunities and she shorte in the role
last night. Mme. Homer's voice does not
seem to have gained since last year.
It has acquired a certain throaty qual
ity that my memory does not associate
.with her work of last season. It Is a rich,
warm, round voice, with some full-fibred
lower notes that are eminently pleasing
and k. valuable upper range. But it is
not used to its full advantage, though
Mme. Homer is always pleasing, and
makes the most of every role â as she did

for the head tax of $1 on each alien sea
man discharged at this port.
Powderly calls attention to a recent de
cision of Judge Toulmin to the effect that
there is a distinction between alien sea
men before and after discharge at any
port of the United State 3. When dis
charged such' alien seaman is reverted to
his national status as an alien regardless
of his occupation, and as such is subject
to the provisions of the immigration laws.

Fashionable Audience
Shows Sympathy
for Artist.
THE reappearance of Mme. Eames
last evening in Verdi's opera,
"Aida," attracted a large audience
to the Grand Opera-house, and,
while there were a number of seats
unoccupied, the theater presented a bril
liant appearance.
Although it had been announced by
Mme. E"ames that she had entirely recov
ered from her cold, it was evident, in the
first act of the opera, that the famous
singer was still suffering from hoarse
ness. She held herself in reserve in the
first and second acts, but in the "Nile
Scene" she was observed to cough a num
ber of times. In the great aria, "Oh,
patria mia," her voice broke on a high
note and a shiver went through the big
audience. A most remarkable scene then
occurred. A death-like stillness fell upon
the audience, and all wondered if the
woman on the stage would be able to go
through with the scene.
Mme. Eames summoned all her reserve
force and finished the act In a manner
that called forth a thunder of applause.
She was summoned before the footlights
a dozen times and monster bouquets were
thrown to her from boxes and orchestra
occupants.
The enthusiasm Â¦vCas more than the
usual ovation accorded to a singer. Those

SWITCHMEN IDLE
Traffic, However, Is Not
Materially Interrupted
on Railroads.
Several Steel and Iron Works
Compelled to Temporarilly
Close Down.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 29.â Traffic was
not interrupted in a marked degree to-day
on any of the railroads by reason of the
switchmen's strike, save on the Allegheny
Valley. This road is still crippled, and
as a consequence several industrial plants
were compelled to suspend operations ow
ing to their supply of coal being exhanst
ed. The Shoenberger plant of the Ameri
can Steel and "Wire Company at Twenty
fifth street partially suspended operations
to-day, as did the American " Steel and
Wire Company's plant at Twenty-sixth
Btreet. The Marshall Machine and Con
struction Company and the Zugs Sable
Iron Works, which closed down on Wed
nesday night, did not resume operations
to-day.
The Pittsburg and Lake Erie Railroad
is still blockaded at different points along
its divisions. The striking switchmen
have not relinquished hope of winning the
battle. They assert that despite the state
ments by railroad, officials they are rapid
ly gaining ground! A committee appointed
by the strikers stated to-night that there
were still 800 members of the Switchmen's
Union idle, and that all of these are de
termined to remain away from the rail
road yards until they return collectively.

CHICAGO, Nov. 29.â The lease of the
Burlington system to the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy Railroad Company for

signed the lease for both the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company
and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railway Company, as he is president of
both corporations.
A meeting ot the latter company was
held recently and the entire official staff
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railroad Company were made the staff
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy

SEATTLE, Nov. 29.â Lambert E. Crip
pen, a young man residing in this city,
was to-day accidentally shot and killed
by his friend, Sayle3 Hutchins, while the

Hutchins raised his shotgun to fire into
a flock of ducks, when the trigger caught
in his coat and the charge was exploded,
striking Crippen In the stomach.
LA CROSSE, Wis., Nov. 29.â G. E. Sander
son, a prominent stockman of Trempeleau, Wis.,
who was in charge of blooded stock for the
Chicago Livestock Show, was instantly killed
in a wreck last night on the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad at the entrance of tun
nel No. 3, between Sparta and Summit.
in the theater realized the great strain
under which Mme. Eames was suffering.
She had left the warmth of her apart
ments to brave the draughts and dust of
the opera-house stage rather than disap
point the public. The generous applause
of the audience touched the singer, and
there were tears in her eyes when she
came before the curtain.
Th entire performance was a remark
able one in every respect. Not only
did Mme. Eames triumph under adverse
circumstances, but Scotti, who sang tue
role of Amonasro, surprised even his most
ardent admirers. De Marchi, Louise
Homer, Journet and Muhlmann shared in
the applause, and Conductor Seppilli ren
dered Verdi's superb music as it has never
been heard here before.
To-night Mme. Calve will sing in "Car
men," and the house is almost sold out.
Fritzi-Scheff is to sing Micaela, Journet
is to be the Toreador and De Marchi the
Don Jose.
"II Barbiere di Slviglia" is the offering
for the matinee to-day, with Mme.
Sembrich in her great role of Rosina.
To-morrow night 'Lohengrin" will be
given at popular prices. There is a big

AN OPEN LETTER

Addressed to Women by the Treasurer
of the W.C.T.U. of Kansas City,
Mrs. E. C. Smith,
-
"My Dear. Sisters : â I believe in advocating and upholding
everything that will lift up and help women, and but little use appears
all knowledge and learning if you have not the health to enjoy it.
; â¢â¢; Having found by personal experience that E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound is a medicine of rare virtue, and having seen
dozens of cures where my suffering sisters have been dragged back to
life and usefulness from an untimely grave simply by the use of a few
bottles of that Compound,- I . must proclaim its virtues, or I should not
be doing my. duty to suffering mothers and dragged-out housekeepers.
" Dear Sister, is your health poor, do you feel worn out and used
up, especially do you have any of the. troubles which beset our sex, take
my advice let the doctors alone, try X.ydla E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound it is better than any and all doctors, for it cures and they
do not."â Mrs. E. C. Smith, 1212 Oak St, Treasurer W. C. T. U., Kan.

MRS. E. C. SMITH.
What is left for the women of America after reading such a letter as thÂ«
above, but to believe. Don't some of you who are sick and miserable feel how
wicked you are :to remain so, making life a burden for yourself and your
friends when a cure is easily and inexpensively obtained ? Don't you think it
would pay to drop some of your old prejudices' as Mrs. Smith says, and M Try
Liydia E. Pinknam's Vegetable Compound, which is better than all the
doctors for cures Surely, the experience of hundreds of thousands of
women whom the Compound has cured should convince all women of the wis-
dom of taking the advice that Mrs. Smith offers in her letter above published.
Read What firs. Burnham says :
* l Dear Mbs. Pinkham : â Words fail to express how thankful I am to you
for your advice, and I : cannot speak too . highly of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. I was sick for three years with female weakness ;
j I had dizzy spells, headache, backache, feet and hands were cold all the time,
would get tired and faint very. easy. / I also had dropsy and was troubled with
leucorrhoea. I suffered for two weeks before each menstrual period and my
ovaries would swell very badly. v I took lots of medicines from doctors, but
received no benefit. To please my husband' I tried Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, and I am now a well woman, and your Compound
alone did it."â Mrs. H. W. Bubstham, Russell, Mich. (Jan. 31, 1901).
. Follow the record of this medicine, and remember that these thousands
â¢of cures of women whose letters are constantly printed in this paper were not
brought about by " something else," but by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, the great Woman's Remedy for Woman's Ills.
\ Those women who refuse to accept anything else are rewarded a hundred
thousand times, for they, get what they want â a cure. Moral â Stick to the
medicine that you know is Best. Write to Mrs. Pinkham for advice. t. ;

A Bankers View of Trade.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says
of the commercial situation: "No one gain
payf the satisfactory conditions of general busi
ness which are evident on every side. Con
fidence is general, consumption is going on at
an unprecedented pace and new enterprise is
active. We are now producing almost as much
rig iron ag England and Germany combined
and yet have less than two weeks' supply of
the articie on hand. The demand for iron has
never been approached and there are enough
order? in sight to keep our mills, new and old,
fully employed for months to come. Our rail
road* are still taxed to their utmost with
freight, and in some cases business is actually
suffering from a congestion of traffic which
the roads cannot properly handle. In the
Northwf-st development is going on at a rapid
pace, and the only important, drawback is In
iast summer's drouth district. Both cotton
and corn have been seriously injured in certain
sections, and, while fortunate offsets have
sometimes appeared, still these losses must
have a deterrent effect. The loss of the corn
crop will be felt more seriously after January
1 than now; not so severely perhaps in the
lcÂ«s of corn shipments as in the movement
of live stock. Nevertheless the business situa
tion, as a whole, is Â«ound and satisfactory,
and its effect upon tbeÂ» stock market is to re
strain conspicuous bear tactics. Stock Ex
change prices are already very high, which
materially lessens the chances of an excessive
further advance. Had prices been allowed to
react to n more natural basis in response to
the United States Steel strike, the corn crop
dieaster and the assassination of President Me-
Kinley we should have now an excellent situa
tion for legitimate activity and advancing
price*, but the powerful and persistent man
ner in which the market was sustained against
those adverse factors made outside buyers hes
itate.
"Gold exports had surprisingly Email effect
This was because we are in excellent position
for sparing the precious metal. On November
1 the stock of monetary gold in the country
Â¦wafe about $1,170,000,000. Â¦ This supply is being
constantly augmented by home production and
receipts on the Pacific Coast, so the exit of
a few millions to Europe need cause ,no cct;
cern, especially as it will afford relief in
Europe, where most needed. Very unpleasant
developments would have occurred in Europe
but lor the assistance the United States has
offered, not so much by gold exports as by
paying good prices for our own securities, the
proceeds of which helped tide over difficulties
in Berlin and elsewhere." '

end it was left to its own course. The de
moralization in the raw copper market in Lon
don was the impelling cause of the decllno.
There were enormous sales there of spot cop
per and of future*, resulting in a decline in the
price of the former of Â£5 per ton and in :he
latter cf Â£4 per ton. The stocks of all copp?r
securities scored violent declines in foreign
market? and the prices of metal? slumped nil
eround in London, including pig tin, lead and
iron. Anaconda fell three points in sympathy
â¢with Amalgamated. Rumors were very p?r
efFtent of a determination on the part of the
company to abandon the attempt to sustain
the price- of spot copper, but no official admis
sion could be secured on the subject. A Judi
cial decision adjudging a direr-tor of the com
pany Kullty of contempt of court for. failure
to testify in the suit against the absorption of
the Boftcn and Montana was possibly a sub
sidiary cause of the weakness. The demoral
ization of Amalgamated Copper was without
notable effect in the general market until near
Urn close. There were a number of strong
points developed, due to individual causes, and
the market was inclined to harden all around
on the published forecast of a favorable bank
statement, but the final drop In the copper
stocks caused the loss of the ; principal gains
and carried prices a point or more below last
night for Union Pacific. Atchison. Missouri Pa
cific, New York Central and Baltimore and
Ohio. Sugar was at one time more than 2
points higher, but lost practically all of the
gain. Other gains of a point or over were
shown at one time by the United States Steel
[ stocks, several minor steel stocks, St. Paul,
Wabash preferred. Reading, Louisville, Man
hattan and several of the industrials. The Pa
cific Coast stocks were all strong, advances of
2 to 4 points. Owing to the Thanksgiving holi
day the figures furnished by the banks of cash
changes show results only up to Wednesday
night. But the movement of cash from the
interior was clearly in favor of this center, and
indicates a net gain by the banks on the -ex
press movement of upward of a million dollars,
which more than offsets the losses on sub
treasury operations. The drafts,- against ar
rivals of gold at San Francisco, which are on
the way to the amount of nearly $1,000,000, have
not figured in the week's showing. â¢ The Gov
ernment's revenue requirements '-.' upon the
money market show a distinct relaxation, the
month's receipts thus far falling over a mil
lion below those of last year, while the ex
penditures are several- hundred thousand dcl
lars in excess of those" for ' the corresponding
period of last year. - - - I .-<â¢ i .Â¦â¢â¢'â¢
Central of Georgia income bonds 'were strong
for the three issues and Consolidated Tobacco
4s advanced on the declaration of a dividend
on Continental Tobacco.
The bond market generally was irregular.
Total sales, J4. 130,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Nov. 29.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
From now on retail rather than wholesale
demand will attract most attention. Colder
weather and snow would, however, benefit
Northwestern trade and industry, though the
open weather prevailing has enabled more than
ordinarily complete farming preparations and
extended building activity. Accompanying the
Improvement of â the tone in trade there has
been a broadening and deepening of specula
tion in leading food staples, and all in all
there Is a rather mere cheerful feeling pre
vailing. No sign of tht usual seasonable quiet
ing down in the demand for iron and steel Is
apparent and buyers are as eager as ever to
obtain supplies. The car shortage and the con
gestion of freight in the Plttsburg district has
been accentuated by the switchmen's strike,
and the trouble there, if anything. Is aggra
vated. A number of furnaces are banked and
several mills are Idle for lack of supplies. Fin
ished products, bars, sheets and structural ma
terial are all active and there has even been
an improvement in plates. Foundry Iron is
50c higher at Chicago. Seventy-five cents to $1
per ton advance on ruling rate must be paid
for prompt delivery of pigiron and billets at
Pittsburg. The big steel interests are reported
as having plenty of cars but not enough mo
tive power is offered. Bradstreet's Halifax
correspondent reports large sales of Cape
.Breton steel in the United States.
xhe strength of the cearser grains, corn anl
oats, has been the sustaining feature of wheat,
which might otherwise have receded on large
Northwestern receipts and a heavy increase In
the visible supply. A resume of the world's
cereal food supply shows a shrinkage this year
of 1.056,000,000 bushels as compared with last
year.
Provisions are showing exceptional strength,
due to shorts covering and reported heavy buy
ing by packers. Hog receipts are large, but
their weights are light, and this accounts for

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade to-morrow will say: A gen
eral advance in the price of pigiron indicates
that record-breaking activity at furnaces fails
to produce accumulation of supplies. Steel
mills are seeking material urgently and Besse
mer pig for prompt delivery at Pittsburg is
not available below $16 50. Large sales of forge
and fdundry iron are reported at further ad
vances and Southern iron in the Chicago mar
ket is also higher. Buying of railway sup
plies is the most urgent feature, rails, car 3.
engines, structural material for bridges and
shop equipments all being wanted much earlier
than they can be delivered. In general lines
the movement is scarcely less active and at
present the business in 1902 appears limited by
facilities, but it is probable that producing ca
pacity will be greatly enlarged. The feature
among the minor metals was the sharp advance
in tin to much the highest point of the year
because of delayed arrivals. In marked con
trast to the rise in tin was a sharp decline in
silver to the lowest price since early in 1898.
Shoe shops at the East are fully employe!,
while Western producers were never before
so actively engaged. Recent buying of cotton
goods for China has stimulated the export
movement and for the year just passed the
value shows an increase over any previous
year.
Asia and South America are the leading cus
tomers. Conditions aro even more favorable at
woolen mills, one concern refusing a large or
der for. delivery in February. Heavyweight
goods are very active with retailers and Job-
Whoat also held firmly, closing the week more
than 3c above the price a year ago, which is
most satisfactory in view of the vast increase
in yield.
Receipts at the interior are liberal. 6,280,443
bushels, against 3,901,793 last year, but the gain
In foreign buying is still the feature, exports
from all ports of the United States in five days
aggregating 3,975,819 bushels, compared with
2,839,070 a year ago.
Failures for the week numbered 182 In the
United States, against 178 last year, and 25 In
Canada, against 21 last year.

Continued on Page Thirteen,SAYS HIS WIFE
TAPPED THE TILL
L. J. Westlake Makes
Objection to Paying
Alimony.
She Admits Taking Money,
but Asserts It Was Only
Borrowed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 29.
, Leonard J. Westlake, who keeps a
drugstore at Emeryville, says his wife
tapped the- till in his place of business.
Hi wys she tapped it so often that she
Bow quite a comfortable bank ac
"Â» unt. That is why he objects to paying
fc*r alimony, which she claims she is* en
titled to.
Westlake made the till-tapping charge
In an affidavit filed to-day in reply to
Marguerite Westlake's plea for a stipend,
pending the outcome of her suit for di
vorce on the ground of cruelty. The
plaintiff asserts that her husband treated
her so inhumanely that she was forced to
leave him and fly to her brother in San
Francisco.
When the motion for alimony was
called in Judge Greenes court defend
ant s counsel presented affidavits in his
behalf. It was contended that the court
had not jurisdiction in the matter be
cause his wife is now a resident in San
Francisco. He said she had willfully
abandoned her home in Oakland and
packed her trunk with things that did not
belong to her, some of which he com
piled her to disgorge under penalty of a
forced sojourn until they were relin
quished.
Then Westlake asserts that he had a
little drugstore at San Pablo and Park
e venues, in the rear of which he lived
with his wife. There is a patent till in
that store under one of the counters and
this till, Westlake asserts, was frequently
lapped by Mrs. West!ake, she be.ing in
possession of the combination. She, it is
vehemently charged in the affidavit, told
her husband when he remonstrated about
these "borrowings," that they were sums
u*.-.nded for loan to her brother. The
T- iavit maker says, however, that he
iot believe that these amounts were
to her brother, but were appropri
ated by the plaintiff.
In suppor; at Westlake' s assertions that
his wite had a bank account of her own,
an affidavit, signed by Mrs. Benjamin
Westiake. the defendant's sister-in-iaw,
was presented, in which she says that the
:ff had given her to understand that
the had abstracted from 5700 to $Bou from
her husband's store and that she was
poing to keep up the good work until she
nad ?150(i to her credit in the bank.
Upon being called to the stand Mrs.
Westlake admitted that she had taken
from $150 to $300 from the money drawer,
but said that this and $400 more had been
used to pay a certain debt of her fcus
band's. She also admitted accepting $200
from her husband as a balm for her in
jured feelings after he had once slapped
her, but asserted that he had borrowed
it ail back from her.
Judge Greene continued the case a
week, after the wife's attorneys had
pleaded for further time in which to make
Â¦9 some affidavits in their client's behalf.
GOOD FIGHT TO A DRAW.
> T eill and Billy Smith in Ring Battle
at Portland.
PORTLAND, C:\. Mar. 29.â Al Neill of
i San Francisco and "Mysterious" Billy
y Smith of Portland fought twenty rounds
draw at the Exposition building to
: ight. McfU proves himself to be a clever
: . but his blows lacked force. He
tough 1 , an aggressive light all the way
through and jabbed Smith with his left
continually. Smith was very wild and
Neill cleverly blocked his rushes.
Both men were cautious up to the
twelfth round, when they started in to
mix it up. In that round Smith landed
on Neill' s jaw, but Neill came back wi_h
his left and right on the jaw. In the
fourteenth Smith knocked Neill against
the ropes with a heavy right-hander over
the heart, but Neill came up with a smile
and led to Smith's jaw, but fell short.
Smith led with right for Neill's body, but
the San Franciscan was clever on his feet
and got away.
In the eighteenth round Neill landed a
Terrific left-hander on Smith's jaw, which
staggered him. but the gong allowed him
to come up strong for the nineteenth
round. Neill appeared the stronger, but
his blows lacked the force for a knock
out. He punched Smith repeatedly on
the jaw with his left vrhile the latter was
trying for Neiil's body, but Neill either
blocked his blows or got away. When
they came up for the twentieth round it
v.as evident that there would be no
knockout unless a chance blow was de
livered, but both men appeared strong.
There was no fart work in the twentieth,
both men left the ring without a
scratch.
In the preliminary bout between Harry
Foley of San Francisco and Charles Jost
ortiand the former was given the de
w < ision on a foul in the ninth round. The
~;on so enraged Jost that he stepped
up to Foley while the latter's back was
turned and dealt him a stinging blow be
hind the ear. knocking him sprawling on
the floor. The crowd started to take a
hand in the fight, but the police soon re
stored order.

MYSTIC CASTLE
NOW IN ASHES
Fire Destroys Ghostly
Mansion Where Magic
Reigned.
Flames Recall the Strange
Story of Black Cross
Brethren.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
"1118 Broadway, Nov. 29.
Castle Peterhof, with its strange mem
ories of mysticism and magic, is no more.
The rambling structure that overlooked
Upper Fruitvale from the high hillside
on which it stood was burned to the
ground this evening. All that remains of
the mysterious home of the Order of the
Black Cross is a mass of charred ruins
and the memory of the ghostly crew that
once held forth among its uncanny en
vironments.
For miles around the mass of flames
that destroyed the big white castle was
visible. Hundreds of people were attract
ed to the scene, to watch the last of the
mysterious building, which was the cen
ter of one of the most remarkable series
of episodes in the record of fact.
Soon after 5:30 o'clock this afternoon
the fire was discovered. Alarms were
given, and the volunteer departments of
Lower and Upper Fruitvale responded.
But there was not a drop of water avail
able, so the tire fighters could only stand
around and watch the rapid destruction
of the famous old structure.
The place was tenantless and to tramps
ia ascribed the fire that has closed its
existence. Two months ago it was occu
pied as a "Home for the friendless," but
the managers suddenly disappeared one
day. Since then wanderers have enjoyed
its hospitalities.
Strange Story of a Black Cross.
Castle Peterhof was located 150 yards
east of Fruitvale avenue, opposite East
Twenty-seventh street. It was the home
in his lifetime of Dr. Peter William Poul
son, a one-time successful dentist in this
city and one of the central figures in the
strange story of the Black Cross, which
startled Oakland a few years ago. When
he appeared before public gaze it was as
Count Peter Poulson of Castle Peterhof,
founder and high priest of the Brother
hood of the Black Cross, a band of re
ligious devotees who had united to uplift
their spiritual condition. As high priest
Dr. Poulson composed a strange ritual,
calling for incantation and conjurings.
The brethren assembled in a chapel, the
walls and ceiling of which were draped in
black, with streaks of flaming red over
them. In monastic garb the worshipers
made their esoteric divinations and ob
served the ritualistic ceremonies Count
Peter had evolved.
He owned Peterhof and many other
holdings, the accumulation of his many
years of professional practice. Poulson
was at this juncture divorced from Mrs.
Edna Snell Poulson, now a resident of
Berkeley. He became interested in a
clairvoyant, a Mrs. Staples of San Fran
cisco, who had a daughter, Alice. Count
Peter decided that he had been command
ed by voices from the unseen world to wed
the daughter. And in due time there was
a spirit wedding. The new mistress of
Peterhof was installed in the old castle.
By and by trouble broke upon the high
priest of the Black Cross.
The very unspiritual divorce court was
brought into service. Countess Poulson
made very serious charges against her
mystic lord and master. He retaliated
with counter-charges. Before the litiga
tion came to trial the Count deeded Pe
terhof and a lot of Los Angeles property
to the accusing wife. They separated for
a time, but finally were reunited.
Troubles Come to the Count.
Across the path of the Count came one
Lizzie Carter, who had known the leader
of the Black Cross Brotherhood when he
lived in lowa. Lizzie Carter tried to con
vince the dentist that he should put away
his bride Alice and wed her. Miss Carter
was positive that the spirits had gone
awry, and -that she, Lizzie Carter, was
the only true spiritual spouse for the
Count. Miss Carter enlivened the domes
tic mixup by penning many remarkable
letters to the master of Peterhof.
A daughter, Deborah, had been born to
the Poulsons. Among the followers of
the Poulson mysteries was a Mrs. Boui
lon. She had a son, a mere child, who
was duly consecrated as the spirit hus
band of young Deborah.
Another strange devotee was Prophet
Smith, who for several years resided at
Peterhof, an object of curiosity and some
alarm on the part of the uninitiated
neighbors.
At last Count Peter departed and ended
his days at Council Bluffs, where he was
given peaceful burial. Mrs. Poulson, now
a widow, and with Peterhof on her hands,
discovered that litigation cost money. The
years of battle had eaten up the property.
It came to be an object of a dozen law
suits. She defended her title and won,
but the mortgages rendered her victory
a barren one.
The widowed Countess married again a
few years ago. She is now Mrs. Alice
Austin, wife of a San Francisco musician
resi.-Jincr at 108 Clara avenue.
Prophet Smith has gone to his reward.
Lizzie Carter is an inmate of the lowa
State Hospital for the Insane and Peter
hof, with its ghostly towers and gables,
is a heap of ashes.
Held for Burglary.
William Kernan was held to answer be
fore the Superior Court by Judge Mogan
yesterday on two charges of burglary in
$1000 bonds on each charge. It is alleged
that he broke into the basement of Louis
A. Gyles' residence, 1429 Webster street,
on November 23 and stole carpets, which
he sold in a Mission-street second-hand
store, and returned two days later and
stole another large roll of carpet, which
he sold.

I'RANKIE WHITE LOSES
SUIT AGAINST HUSBAND
Supreme Court Upholds "Cattle
King" in Deeding Real Estate
to John Wise.
George E. White, the Round Valley cap
italist, who has figured prominently in
several sensational incidents in Mendocino
County, won a suit in the Supreme Court
yesterday, in which the title to some val
uable real estate was at issue between
himself and his former wife.
It is alleged that when Mrs. Frankie
White was about to sue for divorce the
"cattle king," wishing to prevent her
getting alimony, deeded his prop
erty away. The Judge in whose court
proceedings for divorce were instituted en
joined White from disposing of his pos
sessions, but allowed him to carry on his
usual business pending a settlement of
the case. Shortly afterward White deeded
some real estate to John H. -Wise, and
Mrs. Frankie White brought suit to re
cover it.
The lower court rendered judgment in
her favor, but the Supreme Court held
that as the capitalist had deeded the
property to Wise in payment for a debt,
it was in the line of regular business and
perfectly legal. A decree in favor of
White was then ordered.
Arrested on Suspicion.
Frank Troy and Harry Costello were ar
rested early yesterday morning at
Oregon and Front streets by Police
men Bunner and Green and locked up in
"the tanks " pending an investigation.
When they saw the officers they threw
away a screwdriver and monkey-wrench.
They are suspected of being the men who
have been breaking into commission
houses and stores in the wholesale dis
trict and rifling telephone boxes.
Held for Robbery.

PITCHES WOMAN
INTO THE ROAD
Derailing of Electric Car
Causes Injury to
Passenger.
Mrs. James Pritchard Hurt
in Accident at Eighth-
Street Bridge.
Oakland Office San F*aneisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 29.
Car No. 4 of the Eighth-street (East
Oakland) branch of the Oakland Transit
Company left the track this afternoon
just as it crqssed the eastern approach
to Eighth-street bridge at First avenue.
Mrs. James Pritchard, a widow, residing
at 658 Ninth street, was thrown from her
seat into the street and badly injured.
The car, after it jumped the rails,
plowed through the street and brought
up on the sidewalk crossing. An up
grade in the street offered some obstacle
to the progress of the car and prevented
a much more serious outcome of the ac
cident. Â¦
Mrs. Pritchard was sitting on one of
the outside seats when the sudden jolt
as the wheels turned into the roadway
threw her off the car. She fell in a heap
in the street. The carmen, as soon as the
runaway car was stopped, went to Mrs.
Pritchard's assistance and carried her
into a nearby residence, where she re
mained until surgeons arrived. Her ex
ternal injuries consisted of very severe
body contusions and twistings of rier
arms. She suffered severely from the
shock.
Other passengers on the car were given
a shock and scare, but escaped bodily
injury. The car was in charge of 9fo-<
torman Dodge and Conductor Fltzsim
mons. The railroad men say they can
not discover the cause of the derailment.

BAR POLITICS,
SAYS MR. KNOX
United States Attorney
General Issues In
structions.
Department of Justice Men
Must Not^ Influence
Elections. -
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 29.â The United
States Marshal and District Attorney to
day received copies of a circular from
Attorney-General Knox, with orders to
post in their offices and call to the at
tention of all employes. The circular
says:
"To all officers and employes of the De
partment of Justice: Your attention is
directed to a circular cf this department,
issued August 20, 1900, in which section
2, of the civil service act of January 16,
1883, forbidding any executive officer or
employe, among others, to solicit or re
ceive political contributions from any
officers or employes of the United States,
was quoted and all persons serving under
the department were required to observe
strictly the prohibitions of this law, and
were recommended to refrain from ser
vice on political committees charged with
the collection and disbursement of cam
paign funds. I now repeat the injunc
tions of that circular and add the follow
ing further directions on the subject:
"Rule No. 3 of the civil service rules
provides that no person in the executive
civil service shall use his official authority
or official influence for the purpose of in
terfering with an election or controlling
the result thereof. The spirit of the civil
service laws and rules renders it highly
undesirable for Federal officers and em
ployes to take an active part in political
conventions or in the direction of other
parts of political machinery. Persons in
the Government service under this de
partment should not act as chairmen of
political organizations, nor make them
selves unduly prominent in local political
matters. It is expected and required that
all officers and employes of this depart
ment shall act in entire conformity with
the views herein set forth."

WILSON SAYS THAT HIS REVOLVER
WAS ACCIDENTALLY DISCHARGED
He Testifies in His Own Behalf That the Weapon Went Off as He
Was About to Fire in the Air and That He Did Not See Maggie
Hartwell or Any One Else on the Street, as It Was Very Dark
THE jury m the case of ex-Police
man Robert G. Wilson, who is
charged with the murder of little
Maggie Hartwell, will retire Mon
day to deliberate upon a verdict.
The prisoner was on the witness stand
yesterday and at the conclusion of his
testimony the defense rested its case.
Wilson's defense, as set out in his tes
timony and in the opening statement of
Judge Ferral. is ignorance of the crime
committed and accident, if the death of
Maggie Hartwell followed from the pistol
shot for which he was held responsible.
He admits that he held the revolver tc
his hand, but says it was discharged ac
cidently and without intention.
The first witnesses of the day were po
lice officials and neighbors of Wilson, who
testified to the good character of the de
fendant. Among them were Captains
John Spillane, Dunleavy. Seymour, Ser
geants Green and Mahoney. Officer
Lynch, Jeremiah Deasy and Edward F.
Smith.
Wilson Takes the Stand.
Robert G. Wilson, the accused, old but
not feeble, gave his testimony with an
undemonstrative sureness. On cross-ex
amination he displayed no signs of nerv
ousness. In fact, he seemed indifferent to
his surroundings, never for a moment los
ing his cold and unconcerned manner.
Ex-Judge Bahrs conducted the direct ex
amination.
"How long did you own that pistol?"
asked Bahrs.
"Since the time I was on the police
force." reolied Wilson.
Then the witness told how he put the
pistol in his pDcket on July 4 some time
during the morning. It was the habit to
make noise with it on the national hoii
â¢day.
"Did you fire it off on last Fourth of
July?" inquired Bahrs.
"Yes; one shot at the fence," was the
reply.
"Did you show that pistol to any one
that day?"
"Yes; to Miss Johnson. I was sitting
on my porch and Miss Johnson was also
there."
The witness then said he did not raise
his pistol or point it at any one, nor did
he speak to any one.
Defendant Tells of the Shooting.
Continuing his testimony. Wilson said:
"There was one firecracker thrown
through a bush or. tree on to the porch.
The cracker did no harm and did not
worry me at all. This was some time
after 9 o'clock, about a half an hour after

the general shooting ceased. The bonfire
had practically died o.ut and I couldn't
see who threw the fitecraeker."
"Did you suspect any one of throwing
the cracker?" continued the examiner.
"No," was the -reply.
"What did you do then?"
"I walked from the porch dpwn the
alky- to the post and stood with my back
toward it and facing Fifth street."
"Whom did you see?"
"No one: it was too dark."
Wilson then said he had no other object
in going to the alleyway than to see that
the fire was out. He remained there but
a few minutes. "I saw that the street
was .quiet and it was a good time to fire
my pistol off. I was going to fire it in
the air. I took it out and held it in both
hands in front of me and. as I was in
the act of cocking it, it went off. I was
facing tov/ard Fifth street."
"Did you hear any outcry or commo
tion in the street?"
"I did not. I waited a few seconds and

then walked toward Fifth street and met
Mr. Coleson. I saw no children. I saw
Mrs. Cadanasaw and then walked back
to my house."
"Why didn't you fire the. rest of the
shcts?" questioned Bahrs.
"Just for that reason; that one went
off while I was cocking the gun and I
was afraid the others 'might go off thfi
same way," was the reply.
Explains How Shot Was Fired.
The defendant next told how he re
turned to the basement and put his pistol
away in the cellar. Mrs. Wilson had al
ways objected to him having the pistol
in the house. At this time he had no ink
ling that anybody was hurt.
Wilson's right hand is maimed. The
defense wanted him to tell how it hap
pened, but an objection on the part of
the prosecuting attorney was sustained
and all that Wilson was allowed to do
was to close and shut his hand before
the jury. His left hand is partly para
lyzed.
That ended the direct examination.
Deputy District Attorney Greaney then
took the witness in hand.
"Did you see any one on the street
when you came down from the porch to
the alleyway?" was his first question.
"Yes; in front of Geghen's house," re
plied Wilson.
On direct examination Wilson testified
that the street was quiet. At this point
the pistol used was produced and Wilson
demonstrated to the jury how he ma
nipulated it on th"c night of the shooting.
He showed how, as he testified in direct
examination, the trigger was pulled be
yond the half cock mark and then the
pistol went off. â¢
"Did you intentionally fire at anybody?"
asked Judfre Ferra!.
"No, sir," responded Wilson.
"That is the testimony of the defense,"
said the defendant's attorney, and then
both parties agreed as to the time to be
taken up by the arguments which will be
begun Monday morning.

AGREE ON PLANS
FOR BOND ISSUE
Supervisors Revise Ordi
nances for Public
Improvements.
Seek Advice as to Manner
of Submitting the
Projects.
The Joint Supervisors' Committee on
Judiciary and Public Utilities met yester
day for the purpose of revising the vari
ous declaratory ordinances providing for
the acquisition of public utilities and im
provements, the City Attorney having ad
vised that they were defective.
The first ordinance considered was the
one declaring that public interest de
mands the acquisition of the Tuolumne
River water supply as a municipal sys
tem. As there was a doubt whether the
orumance should be published for five or
fourteen days before final passage, it was
referred to the City Attorney, for a de
cision, as the charter is ambiguous on
the question.
The City Attorney was asked to advise
whether the charter provision requiring
the submission of one public utitlity at a
time to a vote of the people contemplated
that the proposal to issue bonds for
parks, school sites, school buildings,
sewer system and hospital should be made
at separate elections. Also whether each
separate school or square proposed to be
acquired should be voted upon separately
or whether they can be voted under one
blanket project.
The proposition to incorporate the St.
Mary's square plan in the bond issue met
witn some opposition, but it was finally
recommended.
The ordinance for the erection of school
buildings was amended to provide for the
acquisition of six school sites. The Board
of Education's recommendation that a
site be acquired for the Lowell High
School to cost $100,000, that a building be
erected to replace the Madison Primary
School to cost $50,000, and that a building
be erected for a new Polytechnic High
School to cost $150,000 were incorporated
in the ordinance.
Mayor Phelan suggested that the sewer
proposition be cut from $5,600,000 to $2,800,
00, as he feared the bond issue as a whole
might be jeopardized if such large sums
were proposed to be expended. He favor
ed that the issue for the rest of the
money be submitted to the people in five
or six years from now. The committee,
however, decided that the original amount
should stand.
Brandenstein favored $1,000,000 for a hos
pital, but the Board of Works had rec
ommended an expenditure of $500,000 and
no change was made.
Reed's motion that the school projects,
parks, sewer system and hospital be in
corporated on separate bills was adopted.
A representative of the West of Castro
street Improvement Club petitioned that
Twin Peaks be acquired for park pur
poses. He was requested "to ascertain
what the property would cost.
DENNIS O'STJLLIVAN SCOBES
ANOTHER LONDON TRIUMPH
Talented San Franciso Boy Wins
Words of Praise From Critical
English Audience.
The news received from London that
Dennis O' Sullivan, the San Francisco
singer, has given another successful con
cert there and has again won words of
praise from the English critics, is a
source of much pleasure to his friends

was the whole show. He sang twenty-six
songs, and with his splendid voice, artis
tic method and intelligent interpretation
held the close attention of an enthusi
astic audience to the end. Miss Edith
Ladd, another San Franciscan, also won
favorable opinion as accompanist.

BERRY PROPERTY
CAUSES TROUBLE
Husband Objects to Wife
Getting San Rafael
House.
The fact that Jessie L. Patton-Berry,
who is suing William F. Berry for di
vorce for desertion, wants the Patton
home in San Rafael given to her is prov
ing a thorn in the side of Judge Hunt,
before whom the divorce sutt is being
tried. Their home is worth about $3500.
Berry, who is an accountant for the
Mercantile Trust Company, is willing to
I pay his wife $50 a month for the support
of their two daughters, but he does not
I want to give up his share of the San Ra
, fael home. Mrs. Berry is equally anxious
! to hold the property, and thinks her hus
band should allow her to keep the home
and also contribute to the support of the
two daughters. The case was submitted
yesterday, but will not be decided by
Judge Hunt until the value of the house
and lot is decided by the disinterested
person appointed by the legal representa
tives of the couple.
L>. A. Shadburne, who is suing for a
dissolution of the bonds of matri
mony uniting him to Anna V.
Shadburne, was ordered by Judge
Hunt yesterday to pay his wife $25 a
month for the support of . the infant
daughter of the couple while the suit is
pending. Shadburne informed the court
when the order was issued that he did
not think he would be able to comply
with the decree of the court, but changed
his mind when Judge Hunt informed him
that unless he paid the amount due for
the month of November before 5 p. m.
to-day he would have to go to jail.
Husband Expresses Himself.
After the order was made Shadburne
followed his wife to the corridor outside
the courtroom and told her in very force
ful language just what he thought of the
court, herself and everybody connected
with the suit.
Shadburne claims he is entitled to an
aunullment because, he alleges, at the
time the lady became Mrs. Shadburne
she was the wife of T. G. Carpenter. Mrs.
Shadburne admits she was married by
contract to Carpenter, but claims she
never was his wife because of the fact
that when the contract was executed Car
penter had a wife living.
George Monnier, who is suing Violet I.
Monnier for divorce for cruelty, told his
story to Judge Hunt yesterday. He testi
fied that his wife threatened to kill him
on three occasions.
Monnier told how his wife attempted
to kill herself by taking poison. She was
only saved, the husband claimed, by the
prompt action of the attaches of the hos
pital to which she was sent. Monnier
also told the court that his wife took one
of the two Monnier children to the ocean
beach and attempted to drown herself
ond tins little one.
Aiinie E. Morris, who was married to
Jeff D. Morris on July 15, 1901, filed a
suit fur divorce yesterday. She claims
that two or three days after she became
Morris' wife he began treating her
cruelly.
Threatened by the Husband.
She alleges he threatened to disjoint her
and cut off her fingers and toes. She
further alleges that on one occasion ha
destroyed her clothing and broke every
plate in the house with a hatchet. Morris
keeps a lodging-house at 6 Central place.
Gr;;ce G. Brooks is suing Robert C.
Brooks for divorce on the ground of >nfi
delity. She says her husband has been
traveling about the country with a wo
man known as Esther Hobbs, Eva Garb
and Esther Kraetzer. The Brooks were
married at Oakland in 1897.
Mrs. Jennie C. Plumber, who runs a
lodging-house at 514 Eddy street, filed a
suit lor divorce yesterday against Wil
liam R. Plumber for failure to provide.
She says she owns all the furniture at
514 Eday street, and secured an order re
straining Plumbei from selling it, as, she
claims, he threatens to do. Mrs. Plumber
alleges that she supports herself and
thr<;t> children and that her husband ds>3s
nothing but interfere with her in the
management of the lodging-house. The
parties were married in 1883.
Judge Murasky yesterday ordered Dr.
Alfred Happersberger, who is being sued
by Euphemia Happersberger for divorce,
STRIKES ENEMY
WITH BLACKJACK
Timothy Killeen Make 3
Murderous Assault on
John F. Donovan.
A murderdus assault was made early
yesterday morning upon John F. Dono
van, a bartender living at 519 Jessie
street, while he was asleep in a chair in
a saloon on Market street.
Donovan was twice struck on the
head with a blackjack, and while it is
thought that his skull is fractured there
is said to be no danger of fatal result.
Timothy Killeen, an ironmolder living
at 540 Howard street, Special Officer
James Murphy, who is attached to the
Thalia dance hall, and John O'Brien vis
ited the saloon shortly before 3 o'clock
yesterday morning and ordered drinks.
Killeen saw Donovan asleep on a chair
and at once attacked him with a black
jack, striking him two vicious blows on
the head. 1 red Krucker, who conducts
the cigar stand in front of the saloon,
seized a club and ran to Donovan's assist
ance. Special Murphy thereupon drew
his club and dared Krucker to interfere.
Murphy was asked to arrest Killeen but
refused. Donovan, after the second blow,
kicked Killeen and his hat fell off.
Killeen ran out of the saloon and Mur
phy picked up the hat and went after him
with it. Six witnesses saw the assault by
Killeen upon Donovan.
Policeman Beach was notified and he
sent Donovan to the Receiving Hospital,
where two ugly wounds in his scalp were
dressed. The surgeons thought there
might be a fracture of the skull, but were
not positive. About an hour after the
assault Beach and Officer Murphy arreat
ed Killeen in a saloon on Second street
and booked him on a charge of assault to
murder. They also arrested Special Mur
phy and O'Brien. When O'Brien was
searched a blackjack, brass Knuckles and
club were found in his pockets and he
was booked on a charge of carrying con
cealed weapons.
Murphy was locked up \m "the tanks,"
but yesterday afternoon rre was booked
on a charge of refusing to make an ar
rest. His star will be taken from him.
The trouble between Killeen and Dono
van started Sunday night in the saloon
at 44 Second street, where Donovan was
employed as a bartender. There was a
dispute about drinks between them and
a fight ensued, during which Donovan
struck Killeen on the forehead with a
bungstarter, knocking him out. When
Killeen recovered Donovan had disap
peared and Killeen threatened to get even
with him at the first opportunity. Dono
van was afraid to return to the saloon.

by Pupil Who Tendered the Â»
Coupon.
Suit was filed yesterday in the Justice's
Court against the Sutter-street Railway
Company for $299 damages by Cora Otis,
through her guardian and father, James
Otis. The complaint alleges that the
company issued to the plaintiff a book
of half-fare school tickets for transporta
tion to Miss West's School on school days
during October. The complaint says:
On returning from school on October 7 plain
tiff got on a Paclflc-avenue car and tendered
her school ticket to the conductor, who, in a
loud and boisterous manner, refused to take
the coupon and demanded that she pay her
fare in cash.
Plaintiff told the conductor she had no money
and he stopped the car with the avowed pur
pose of putting Cora oft when a lady passenger
took pity on her distressed condition and paid
her fare.
