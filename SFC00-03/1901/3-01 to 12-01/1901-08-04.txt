It is by means of hypnotism that many
of the attributes and powers of tha sub
conscious intelligence have been ascer
tained, and the most convincing proofs ef
dual personality are found in hypnotla
demonstrations.
Proofs of the theory of dual personality
are frequently noticed in the daily press.
A man disappears and months afterward
be Is heard of In the Philippines, whole
be Is a soldier. Through some psychic
change his personality changed; In the
changed state he enlisted, in time bis
original self returns and he Is ignorant it
bis whereabouts or how he arrived there.
His Ufa as a soldier is a blank. Such
cases or similar ones are chronicled every
day.
Investigators in this direction call tha
everyday mind the abjective mind. and.
the intelligence that lies deeper the sub
jective mind. The secondary entity has
also been called the second self, the sub
conscious or subawaklng mind; the sub
liminal self; the submerged ego. It has
been shown that this secondary mind
Is identical with the intelligence mani
fested in hypnosis.
Somnambulism furnishes a multitude of
facts to prove the theory of a secondary
Intelligence. The sleep-walker will aril*
tad with pen and paper perform mental
tasks that his everyday personality could
sot possibly perform, and in many ways
tha somnambulist will give evidence that
ha Is guided by an intelligence having dif
ferent powers and capabilities from the
normal everyday entity. The doings of
sleep-walkers are most marvelous and
almost beyond belief. '
What proof exists that a dual person
ality dwells within the human frame?
6oma of tha reasons for the theory of
dual personality will be briefly noted.
Suppose it is important that you should
arise at an unusually early hour; you re
tlra with this thought uppermost in your
mind and fall asleep. "When the hour for
arising arrives you awake with a start.
This has happened many times in '< tha
lives of each of us. What is it that
promptly awakens the sleeper .at or near
a certain hour? Only one explanation
can be found in all tha pages of-learn
ing. It is the subconscious personality.
But how can this mysterious personality
tell the time when all the senses ara
sealed in slumber?
Automatic writing Is mentioned as
another proof of the existence of a" dual
entity. The hand grasps a pencil or rosts
lightly on a planchette. Often, without
any volition on the part of the operator,
the pencil -traces - curves, lines, letters,
words and sentences; questions - are
answered and many evidences ara given
of a controlling mind distinct from that
of the operator. This experiment has been
repeated by thousands of observers, and
tha question naturally arises, what
directs tha movement of the pencil or
planohette? The only rational answer lO
that the plancbette is controlled by *
secondary self independent of the normal
mind. â¢ - -Â¦'
Tha theory of dual personality, if proven
true, will overturn many of the old-time
Ideas of ' religion, accountability, mental
philosophy and medicine; codes, will have
to ba remodeled, and many of tha aocept
Â«d Ideas on cognate subjects will need to
be reconstructed. But no one need be
alarmed. The sum of human happiness
will not ba decreased, nor will the, torch
â¢f truth be dimmed, nor the world's pro
gress Impeded. The discovery of a new
law of being may sweep away a few dop-'
mas and musty creeds, but no real dam
age will ba done.
Only a brief outline can be here at
tempted, and those who care- to further'
follow this strange theme are referred to
tha writings of Hudson, Binet, Sldit, My
ers and others who have devoted years ta
the unraveling of this mystery of being. ,

cases will be given. The first is that of.
AlmaZ. .
Dr. Osgood Mason In the Journal of
Nervous and Mental Diseases, September,
1833, reports . the following Interesting;
case, given in a recent book by Professor
Sidis: "Alma Z. has been under my ob
servation during the past ten years. , la
childhood she was remarkable for her in
telligence and unusual endowments. Up
to her eighteenth year she was in robunt
health, excelling all her companions not
only In intellectual attainments but also
. in physical culture, being expert in gym

sports generally. At that time, owing to

limited vocabulary, ungrammatical an<V
peculiar dialect* decidedly Indian in char

ing and amusing. The intellect waÂ»
bright and shrewd, her manner lively and
good-natured, and her intuitions were re
markably correct and quick; but, strang-
Scientific records contain many cases of
dual personality that have been carefully
studied. French scientists have taken
the lead In Investigating- this question and
have patiently labored for facts in a
realm shadowy, weird , and mysteriousâ
the border land of the unknown. This
subject has a practical bearing and in
vestigations along this line will probably
unravel many curious and puzzling com
plications. There are diseases of the body.
Â«f the mind, and there are psychological
disorders that disturb the foundations Â©f
being and mar the warp and woof of
human personality.
A thus becomes a. mind reader, a clairvoy
ant, or medium, or messiah, according to
, Inclination, education or circumstances.
â¢ Here arises another phase of the mys
,tery\. Does the so-called second self ever
take possession of the body and uÂ»urp tha
place of the ruling entity? Does anybody-,
else ever inhabit my body? And. If so.
.where do I go to? -Am I responsible for
the acts of my other self? Is a person
< , always responsible for the acts of bla
body? V ; y . .
These questions bring up a most start-,
ling and deeply interesting theme. It is
possible that this theory may throw light
on some puzzling occurrences. Take klep
tomania, for example. According to tha
theory under discussion, kleptomania la
a psychical disease in which. at certain
times the normal entity is set aside and
a stranger temporarily occupies the
.throne of reason and will. It Is believed
'that this usurpation, of the throne of will
often occurs, but generally It , Is never
suspected 'unless the new tenant of thÂ«
'brain commits some overt act such '*Â»
stealing.
This is known as te'epathy. .Suppose in
the case cf A that his objective and nor
mal intellects can communicate freely
the one with the other: now suppose his
secondary mind receives a telepathic com
munication from the secondary mind " of
eome distant person. This Is communi
cated to his objective or. conscious . mind.
In some persons communications be
tween the objective and subjective minds
can be carried on without difficulty. Any
fact received by the subconscious mind
can be communicated to the normal or
conscious mind. Now authorities " state
that subconscious minds can communicate
with each other at any distance by some
Â¦unknown kind of wireless telegraphy.'
Some i>ersons are so constituted that It
is impossible for the second self to make
any demonstration that may be recog
nized by the everyday mind; in others
the secondary entity is very often in evi
dence.
In the discussions concerning: the pow
ers cf the subconscious intelligence the
reader may be astonished by- the claims
made by investigators, but both the Lon
don and Boston Psychical societies have
Issued reports showing careful and scien
tific research on this question and- the
conclusions of these societies cant hardly
be doubted.
The character of the subconscious ege
differs in diffrent persons. There Is as
much difference in subconscious minds as
in normal minds.

"I had hoped by suggestion to run the
two personalities into one and make the
memories continuous, but. no artifice
would avail to accomplish this, and Mr.
Bourne's skull to-day still covers two dis
tinct personal selves."
"This was all that was known of the
case up to June 1, 1S90, when I induced
Mr. Bourne to submit to hypnotism, so
as to see whether in the hypnotic trance
his Brown memory (Brown self-conscious)
would come back. It did so with surpris
ing readinessâ so much, indeed, that it
proved quite impossible to make him
while in hypnosis remember any of the
facts of his normal life. He had heard of
Ansel Bourne, 'but did not know as he
had ever met the man.' When confronted
with Mrs. Bourne he said that he had
never seen the woman before. On . the
other hand, he told us of his peregri
nations during the last fortnight and gave
all sorts of details during the Norristown
episode.
able part of the change is. of course, the
peculiar occupation which the so-called
Brown Indulged to. Mr. Bourne has
never in his life had the slightest contact
with trade. ] Brown was described by the
neighbors as taciturn, orderly In his habits
and in noway queer. He went to Phila
delphia several times; replenished his
stock; cooked for himself in the back
shop, where he also slept; went regular
ly to church; and once at a prayer-meet
ing made what was considered by the
hearers a good address, in the course of
which he related an incident he had wit
nessed in his natural state of Bourne.
The next . case , to which Attention will
be called is that of Rev. Ansel Bourne.
This is a well known case and has been
carefully : studied; , every point in connec

recognized without the slightest doubt the
presence of, No. 1. A few minutes later

"On January 171 1SS7, Rev y Ansel Bourne
of Green, R. I., an itinerant preacher,
drew $550 from a bank in Providence with
which to pay for a certain lot of land in
Greene, paid certain bills, and got into a
Pawtucket horse car. This is the last In
cident he remembers. He did not return
home that day. He was published in the
papers as missing, and, foul | play being
suspected, the police sought In vain his
whereabouts. On the morning of March

calling himself A. J. Brown, ' who had

She gets the most out of her wheel, her

Helen's wheeling is her only athletic

Think of the keen eye that golf, tennis

year she studies.
She wanted no help about^her wheel.
She is mistress of it and tolerated no
caprices of its quick wheels. She asked
a question or two about the;, ground
whither we had led her, and that was all.
She does her own mounting. In fact, she
often rides alone for a few blocks and
would do so much more if it were not

She has a right to demand a perfect

without mishap in thirteen hours.
"Who v.ent with you?" I asked her.
"A man," she said. "A friend of papa's.
I couldn't get any girl to go along. The
girls all said it would be too hard a trip.
I wouldn't have said it was hard if it
had killed me. I don't mind getting
killed, but I won't back down."
I began then to suspect what I proved
laterâ that she is game.
It also began to dawn upon 'me why,
v "ier. I had called upon her mother to ask
h< r permission to interview Helen, she
1-ad said. "I'll ask Helen If she will see
you. I'll do what I can for you."
"But it didn't kill me," she went on,
"and it didn't come near it. It was .no
mere than a good ride and I was only a
little tiredâ a very little tiredâ when it
was over. Be sure^ and say that, won't
you? Only a little tired. And don't make
it sound as if I had done something great,
because I haven't There was nothing to

euch a fuss about It as If I did some
thing to make a fuss over, and I didn't."
. "Not/papa"alpne," she added. "I'm sort
of a corresponding secretary for the wholi
Â¦family." ' wl .
..There at the typewriter which she uses
rapidly she makes her headquarters much
of the time. "Papa and I like the room
because it's so sunny," she said.
Â¦ She is Quick to notice sunshine and
shade.
We had a try at cribbage before I left
. that afternoon, and my pegs plodded on
vainly behind hers as they galloped.
That isn't, saying much, for my only
practice at cribbage dates back- a long
way to the time when I was a good little
girl and used to play a game with my
aunt in the too short time between din
ner and going to bed. But Helen'sÂ»repu
tation as a winner extends among really
expert cribbage players.
She is punctilious in matters of cut
ting and dealing. When she has her cards
in hai^d she feels them over carefully un
til she knows every one. â¢ They are a
marked pack, and;'so deftly marked that
none but herself can feel the tiny pricks
she has made in the corners of their faces
as cabalistic signs to herself. \ She has
used six dots in different arrangements.
After she has these in mind she-lays the
cards out on the table, in a row, face
down. She knows them by their position.
Then. she is ready to play..
She" has a solitaire game as well that
helps her pass the time. â
The theater is another of her amuse
ments. .Â¦ .
When she told me this I thought she
meant opera.* What could she enjoy of a
performance except the music?
1 "No, I don't mean opera,'! she replied
crisply. "It is the thtater I like, .melo
drama especially. I don't care for com
edy." Â¦'"'.â¢
v.She is not, at 17,. at a humorous age,'
which /probably accounts for this.
"Trilby"' was running then at the Cen
tral and she went with me to "see" it.
She was by far the most interested in the
party.
"What amuses me most is that old
couple," she commented on' the Bagots

She is always in demand for entertain
ments: "Her music, is nbt excellent for a

excellent for any girl of her age." ; *V
The great secret of Helen Masow's mu
sic is that she feels it herself.
Her music is such as all the blind useâ
a cipher of punctures on heavy paper,
looking like the perforated patterns of a
kindergarten. She reads this over a very
few times,; plays from it, memorizes it.
Once learned, her music is never forgot

When she led me up stairs to her
father's study she stepped ahead to close
the door, of a room, where the children
had been playing. ."It looks so disorderly
in there," she said. "I am ashamed to
have you see it.",
She had already "seen" the disorder and
it bothered' her. â¢ That was, one of the
many little things, from which I deduced
that she sees more than' a great many
two-eyed people. ' "...
"Here's where papa 'does. his work," she
said, "and here's where I help him."

from the summit of Mount Tamalpais
over the Tamalpais and Bolinas ridges
Into several canyons and along water
courses. The party went up over the
picturesque line of, the railroad to the
summit in the afternoon, enjoyed the
spectacle of a rarely beautiful sunset and
rested all night at the tavern, rising in
time to see the sun come up from behind
the mountains of the Coaet Range on the
east shore of San Francisco Bay. Â¦ -
Seaward and filling up the Golden Gate:
and landward, conforming to the contour
of the lower foothills, thereby assuming
the appearance of a billowy and snowy
ocean, lay the fog. At its summit anil
downward for a distance of several hun
dred feet. Mount Tamalpais and its neigh
boring- peaks" and also the canyons to the
north, east and west were bathed in bun
shine. , Wild^birds were.ga'.ly piping their
melodies of, the morning. A soft breeze
stirred., and. therHJrjwas-sweet? with the
odors of wild- flowers and shrubbery.
From near the highest point on the
summit, where the whirligig for wind
velocity registration has been set up by
tn"e United States Weather Bureau, the
outlines of the proposed park, as they
could be rudely denned, were pointed out
by the mountaineers. . Like great green
waves the ranges succeeded one another,
seemingly trending toward Tamalpais and
rolling toward the broad Pacific. Be
tween the ranges were canyons, any one
of which might inspire the singer or the
artist. Beyond the irregular rim of green
that ran over the crests and margined
the valleys, the country rose in rounde.1
hills, tawny as lions; curves of beautv
made by Nature's mighty pencil. Trcta
of fantastic outlines stood against the nky
line, accentuating their isolation. Here
were rocky highlands; there leaguea of
chaparral; yonder clumps of treea Â«tn<i
high bushes which migh^t furnish nt co/crt
for the deer. Not far away a great trni^
or redwood, virgin forest which the is b?
the lumberman has never Invaded, held
up Its plumy branches for admiration,
The air moved lazily. The thfe'obir.j*
sound of the sea on its rocky shore eeuiri
hardly be heard. To the eest sparkled
the mirrorlike surface of the buy of Ba^
Francisco. The. peaks of St. Helena and
Diablo 'loomed grandly against the sefj
blue foil of an Italian eky. To the seutij
the encircling fog had fantastically hens;
med Richardsons Bay, lnelesins it as wit:}
a high parapet of purest snow, ee that st
was like an azure lake, unruffled, and
shore bound.
"You will see that the features to l>Â»
preserved are several. There is no land
scape superior to this, so travelers agree.
From the summits all the bay is in vlevr
and all -the ocean so far as the eye "ca.n
i will be resorted to by multitudes of
American citizens, more especially Cali
rornlans. There is no other wilderness so
picturesque and so easily accessible to a.
p-eat city. "What is to be done Â£pr the
('preservation _ of the brush and forests
(which make it so attractive and beautiful
I In large degree must be done now. Think
of it! A national park, rich In view,
magnificent in' variety, the natural home
of the deer and elk, with beautiful sur
prises awaiting the visitor on every side â
Ell within an hour and a half of the great
city of San Francisco!"
Equally enthusiastic with Mr. Kent are
those Â¦who have discussed the Mount
Tamalpais national park proposition. A
meeting was he'd in this city last week at
which there were present a few gentle-
Cmen who had been invited to meet Con
(ErreEsraan Coombs to talk about the mat
ter. No obstacle to the acceptance of a
park by the nation was disclosed. It was
pointed out that Uncle Sam has always
near at hand soldiers to act as a patrol, to
develop the region, who would be bene
fited by getting: practical knowledge of
life in a mountain and wilderness coun
try. The Interests of the surrounding
country. It was als0 explained, would be
served. Handsome properties through
Marin County would be less In danger of
destruction by fire. The watershed of the
Marin. County Water Company would be
preserved.
A writer and an artist for The Call re
cently went over the country which it is
proposed to include as a national park.
They were accompanied by several en
thusiastic mountaineers, who might aptly

THIS IS MARK TWAIN'S SUMMER HOUSE, NEAR SARANAC LAKE
SAMTJEIi L. CliEMENS,. with
whom the world hobnobs as
Mark Twain, has taken unlo
himself a quaint, curious and exceed
ingly comfortable habitation near
Saranac Lake, in what used to bs^hs
Adirondack wilderness. A big dou.bla
veranda is the distinguishing feature
pf tha front, of the Twain home
double by reason, of being two storie3
high.. Birch, pine and occasionally
oak trees surround the house, which
looks as if just enough land had bsen
cleared to znako room, for it and the .
rest left as nature constructed it.
The interior of the cottage is just
what one would imagine the summer
home cf a>nif.n who loved to be com
fortable and knew how. Big fireplaces
drive away all cold, just as the at-
mosphere of the place doss care. The
windows do not push up and, down,
modern fashion,' Â¦ " cr.usin'g veration'
and sometimes loss of breath, but pull
Inward - p.nd pusi .outward as ono
may. will, just like blinds that work
both ways.*.
These windows are big and square,
letting a flood of light into tha rooms,
and upon the plain" but thoroughly
comfortable furniture " with, which
they are filled. On tho first floor aro
the living-room, library and kltcho:i.
Upstairs are tha bedrooms, Mark

very near neighbors as distances go

be neither the matutinal breakfast
bell at the adjoining house nor the
howling of the summer dog next door

"Midsummer In New York" will be thft
subject of a long article opening the
August Centuryâ a Midsummer Holiday
Number. Mrs. Schuyler van Rensselaer,
who writes It, is a native of the. city and
shows her appreciation of Its charms by
being one of the last to go .out of town
in the summer and' one of the first to re
turn in the fall, a considerable part at her
time, being given every year to voluntary
public work. Many full page and smaller
pictures will illustrate the text.
At the top of the hubbub a .shot rang
forth in the barroom. "\ John Â¦ Scannell,
closed In In the rear room, couldn't see
and could only guess the reason cf that
firing. Donahue, seizing the safe advan
tage of Florence Scannell'a ; position and
Florence Scannell. baffled by the locked
door, turned and stood aralnst the bar.
His elbows rested on It: his back was to
the bar and to Donahue. One in the
room with the "repeaters" unlocked the
door. John Scannell pushed it ooen and
entered among, them. About one hundred
men were therein gathered. The entrance
of John Ecannell fell like a fear upon
these lawbreakers. They, deemed him the
advance of Justice In pursuit of them.
With that, many sought to be rid of the
place: there was a deal. of commotion; thÂ«
door through which John Scannell had
entered was closed in the stampede.
"Don't go in there." said Donahue.
There wa? murder in Donahue's heart.
It plowed dully In his bleary eye. and
had the Scajinells been a whit less brave,
and therefore a bit more cautious, they
might have noted It
"Don't Â»ro In there!" cried Donahue to
Florence Scannell as the latter tried" the
door. .,-.- ..... .
On registration day Donahue resort
was made headquarters lor those ia
ported "repeaters" who were to be wed
in that ward. There .were fourscore or
more of these ruffians in thÂ«s room to the
rear of Donahue's bar. . Florence Scan
nell. accompanied by John Scannell, on
the scent of fraud, came into Donahue's.
Florence Scannell. aware of the where
abouts of the "repeaters." walked to the
door of the rear room and sought to en
ter. The door was locked. Donahue
stood behind the bar.
Donahue had office ambitions. He ar
roed with r rfark sagacity that were he
to "remove" Florence Feannell. the Ring
would not only protect him from the law
âwhich in that day was the Ring's will
but prefer him to some coign . of party
height and fatness.
There was cno, Donahue, who keDt a
drinking place at Twenty-third street and
Second avenue. This Donahue was himself
of the Ring's Danites. He had k'lled bis
man and nearly slain his second. His
drinking den was a harbor for Ring crim
inals.
Tt was registration 5n December, 1S63.
The vote of the cityâ the local elections
were then held late in Decemberâ was
making that preliminary answer to its
rame required of the law. The Ring, set
to the defeat of Florence Scannell by all
fou! methods since it m!sht not be fairly
brought about, was. with the use of re
peaters, falsely swelling the reÂ£l-5trat!on
â¢wherecn to lay foundation for the final
Fteal. Florence Scannell. together with
John Fcannell. was busily about in ef
forts to prevent these wrongs of the

His anecdotes are all well chosen and

VndouMedly irary of the more serious

his victims to say "How clever," but aft
*r a great amount of the same kind they
may l>e prone to more forceful expres
sions. For example, in describing a box
ln?r match between Richard Croker and a
professional, he says:
<yr LFRED HENRY LEWIS, the au
f I thor of "Wojfvule" and "ean>:-
I | burrs." has left fiction for fact and
V. [ politics. He has just written a
X life of Richard Croker. In this
book there is much to be commended. Mr.
Lewis has allowed the reader to meet
Croker personally through the medium of
anecdote and so draw his own conclusions
âa wise method in the writing of biogra
phy. The author has evidently enjoyed a
o!cse personal association with Croker
and other leaders of Tammany, and so
â¢whsit he has to say is always of interest.
John Scannell's absence from the scene, -
had shot the younger Scannell in %he
back. There was no word of warning;
between them passed-no looks of differ
ence; murder, cold and safe and coward
ly it was, and the victim's first touch of
his peril was a,' bullet in his back. The
effect was to paralyze: Florence Scannell
clipped to the floor without falling:' and
as John Scannell rushed. in, his eyes rest
ed first on his brother half lying- against
the base of the. bar. In front of him
stood a lesser thug of the Ring:.
John Scannell's hand sought his pistol,
a 44-caliber Colt's. There was a flash
and a crash; the Ring- thug fell, "shot
through the neck.
"John, it was Donahue," whispered
Florence Scannell.
John Scannell sprang: to the front door.
Donahue, fear-spurred, was a block away, ,
pistol in hand, running with all -speed. '. .' Â¦/.

Incapable, could only turn to meet him.
Scannell ceased not to smile. His un
winking eyes did .not waver . from thÂ©
eyes of Donahue. The latter was held
as by a spell. Slowly Scannell went
about Donahue to the right, never wid
ening, never lessening the distance. At
last he had forced Donahue crosswise of
the room,' with naught behind him save
the safe; Insensate wall. The time had
"come.
Not until then did Scannell's hand seek
Â¦^s weapon. And he went slowly after
it. with pauses full of. pleasant hesita
tion. Scannell still tacitly called Dona
hue to action; It was not to be. Dona
hue was as rigidly, helpless as a statue
of ice. With Iron deliberation Scannell
drew his pistol. Donahue, licking a dry
lip. stood* at gaze and as one planet
struck. ; â¢
"Bang!"
Between those murderous eyes which
had lined the shot that stole his broth
er's life,' Scannell's revenge went crash-
Ing. Donahue crippled ) forward, nalf
. turned, and with a sob., which broke on
Scannell like a tune of music, fell head
long down.
John Scannell looked on his prone en

with the tldes^of a generous peace. It
was as though a stone had been rolled
from his heart. Then he went . slowly
forth, and no hour had seemed so sweet
nor the world so bright before.
An officer touched his elbow. Scannell
turned and followed him. The offlcer led
the way. The dead Donahue was where
he fell. A captain of police stood close
at hand.
"Do you see your work?" asked the
' captain.
"I do." The sudden sparkle to glanea
in Scannell's eyes showed how burned
the fires to be kindled In a brother's
breast by a brother's murder. "I do: I
see my work; observe how I approve it."
"Bang!" - \
"And Scannell sent a bullet through the
dead Donahue as he had sent . Â¦ one
through the living Donahue before., The
body jumped on the floor with the
springy concussion of the shot, and then
lay still. The vengeance of John Scan-

Faintly there came a shout, and an

alive then. Was she?
The party almost fell down. the rest of

It was Miss Hall who said it She was

as the timber line was neared.
There they were, indeed; for two figures
could be discerned on the ground. But
how were they? Alive or dead? The par
ty held its breath.
"I heard something."
A shove, and it was done. Over the
steep shot the toboggan with Its human
freight. Down,. downâ
The men strained their eyes until tha
thing was out of sight. One turned away.
He could not look.
. Tied together, the party left commenced
the descent. The snowfall was lessening
now, the cold was less biting. The excite

gone ahead acted as a stimulant, and, the
descent was made In good form and quick

There was some comfort In looking up
at the column of smoke-like vapor that
rose from, the far-above crater. To be
cure, they knew that it did not mean fire,
but they chose to pretend that it did.
"Thos* clouds are nothing but wrea.ths
of aÂ«;ueops vapor condensed by the cool-
Ing of the atmosphere," said a professor
In the party, a literal man.
But popuiar sentiment overruled him.
"They are as good as smoke so long as
we can make them look like it," said Misa
Rawson, "and H's easy enough to imagine
a fire behind smÂ»ke. I feel much warmer
already. Tou, prifessor. don't know what
a blessing imagination is. You ought to
cultivate some of it"
"I am cold," said 1 the professor. *ââ¢

Even with this precaution the cold was

Bethel Rawson. of all the twenty, kept
on talking- grayly.
She drove her spiked shoes into the icy
THERE are various Â¦ways of descend
ing Mount Hood. One is on a man.
This Is not the customary way.
There are very few men who care to
effer themselves for the purpose, so if
anybody is starting out to find a human
toboggan he may Tiave to look long and
far. But there is one man. Professor Mc-
Elfresh by name, who has tried the thing
and, although he " Is not anxious to be
coasted on again, he says he would sub
mit to tt once more under the same cir
cumstances.^ .
He did it to save Bethel Rawson's life.
It was the only chance, and it succeeded.
There is no story so strange in all the
annals of perilous Mount Hood since its
first ascent in '66 by Wood and Atkinson..
Coasting down its glaring. Icy steep on a,
human tobogganâ that is the strange ride
that Bethel Rawson took the other day.
It is a ride that she would always remem
ber, except that she cannot remember it
at all, for she was unconscious all of the
way. . r .
As long as It came out all right in the
end, which It did. she can joke about it
now. Bo can Professor McElfresh. Both
of them are unharmed.
They were both among the most enter
prising of the tourists who ever tried the
ascent. When Miss Rawson was planning
it she said that she meant to do or die.
She rever really thought of anything but
the doing, of course., but the result came
perilously near to the dying. - -
She is an Oregon girl, with grit to throw
to the birds. â¢ .
She had made mountain climbs before,
but not one like this. She already knew
that she was as sure-footed as a goat in
strep places, and that she. was level
headed, which is better yet. Tou can get
along or. a mountainside with almost any
kind of feet if your head Is all right:
likewise your heart, and Miss Rawson
had no lack in this respect.
Her home is in Demoes, Oregon, but she
has not spent all her life in it! She is
something of a traveler, and where she
travels she always makes it a point to do
whatever her hand and also her foot find
eth to do. So when she traveled to Wash
ington and thereabouts and came upon
the base of Mount Hood, and when she
heard that people climbed it she never
hesitated a minute, but made her arrange
ments to climb with a party.
There were twenty-five in the party and
they were a Jolly crowd. They plowed
their way up through the snow with a
deal of joshing and laughing that helped
to keep the blood In their veins warm.
It needed all it could get in this line. Foot
by. foot as they ascended the cold in

to swing their hands before and behind
them with great slaps that set them

Many people can't smoke a dozen cigar

troubled with a perpetual cold in the head.
It Is not the emnke that Is to blame, but
the dust, Now, if you use a cigarette
tubeâ amber, cherry or cardboardâ a tiny
bit of cotton wool in the bottom of it, will
catch every particle of dust.
'cleaning devices are of little use In
making it fresh. But if you pack the bowl
tight with grass or hay and lay the pipe
aside for a few days you will have It as

Even if the submersion lasts for twenty

A launch sufficient for all purposes could be \purchased for

Detective Harry Reynolds one dark
night observed some suspicious move

This was fortunate, for he discovered, not

PIDGIN ENGLISH." or "broken
China," is a queer lingo, mainly
English, but containing also Chi
nese, Portuguese.\ Malayan and
East Indian words. It\ originated in
China, when- the pioneer\English mer
chants settled in Canton, lacking time
'â¢md patience, these men dii(L not study
Cheese, but the natives with whom they
dealt toon learned many EnglUh words,
of which, in accordance with Chinese Idi
om, they formed sentences. \
Travelers in China are apt to injagine
that "pidgin" merely consists in substi
tuting the letter "r" lor "1." and ln\the
liberal, although meaningless, distribu
tion of double "e," but it is, on the cort
trary, a really ingenious' simplification oft
English, which makes many words, in ad
dition to their cv.n duty, do that of sev
eral others.
Various to. t books containing Chinese
phrases and the equivalent "pidgin" ex
ist, and are studied, not only by sen-ants
end tradespeople, but often by natives of
higher degree. Even a dignified Man
darin will occasionally repair to the of
fice of one of hÂ«s foreign friends and ask
to have tsome article in an English or
American newspaper turned for him into
baby talk.
Moreover, the expressive gibberish col
02 s the upeech of foreigners, even *â¢> their
intercourse with one another. For in
stance, no foreign resident of Shanghai
could describe a restive, ill-conducted
horse by any other word than "bobely"; a
note 1* always a "chit," a present a "cum-
Eha," etc., etc., while as for "can do" no
one can do without it.
The word "pidgin" means business, and
In this "business" English comparatively
lew words need be learned.
Thus "my" stands also for "I" and for
"me." "Belong" in addition to filling its
own proper position, replaces the verb "to
be" in all its moods, tenses and persons.
"How are you?" is "How fashion you
belong?" "How have you been?" is "How
fashion you have belong?" "Thank you; I
am very well," is "My thankee you; just
now me belong No. 1." "Do you think
the weather will be tine next month?" is
"How fashion you' thinkee next moon
weather belong No. 1?"
And the way to reply. "I am not sure
the weather will be fine next month; I am
afraid there will be a great deal of rain"
is "My no savey true weather next moon
belong No. 1; my alia same fear catchee
plenty rain come down."
"To pay" is also give, and to hand.
VHe gave me a present" is "He have pay
ray one piecee cumsha." "Hand me that
shawl" is "Pay me that piecee shawl."
To bid a servant hasten upstairs, quick
ly find a book and bring it downstairs to
one. is "Boy! fightee go top-side, look-see
what-slde one piecee book have got chop
chop. Catchee, bring downside, pay my."
"Top-side" and "down-side" , express
heaven and hell, as well as upstairs and
downstairs.
Male servants are always addressed as
"Boy," and "side" is also added to the
names cf places, as, for instance Shang
hai-side, Peking-side, Tientsin-side, etc.
"Where" Is "What-side." "Where is it?"
"What-side. have got?" "Chow-chow"
means 'food and to eat.
"To squeeze" not only implies physical
compression, but also to exact a commis
sion. "To squeeze too muchce" is to cheat.
"To be pretty", is to be "good looksee,"
"to be ugly," "bad looksee," or "no good
looksee." '

From this has sprung the "Boys of Gar

afternoon.' The purpose of this Is to teach
the boys good and useful things and start
them, if possible, on the way to pure
manhood. The houses in our part of
town are small and there are no roomy
yards, or, for that matter, there is no
room for them in the house either, ex
cepting just long enough to eat and sleep.
Consequently they are on the street all
the time sfter school, and it does not take
long for them to learn all manner of bad
habits that will cling to them a life-

hood. The plain talks on pl^in subjects

find all sorts and conditions of thing3.
Most any article ef clothing for people
of all ages and sizes. Furniture, fruit,
groceries, and even toys may be found
there. Hats and shoes, pins and ribbons
may.be found side by side. Anything in
the way of cast-oft clothing or any of the
above named articles will be thankfully
received at 928 Harrison street. The nu
merous articles are quickly sold, and the
small price asked has been the means of
more than one youngster wearing shoes
and whole clothing. For where there are
eight or ten' little children, which is more
often the rule than the exception, it takes
a good income to keep their lively bodies
covered and warm. Nothing Is too old or
too worn to be of some use. If it does not
fit, "necessity is the mother of invention,"
and it can be turned and twisted until it
does.
Our aim is to raise th* standard of edu
cation, morality and religion in. the wide
and fertile district surrounding Sunshine
Hall. It is a field "white unto the har
vest." .
Two days in the week the children troop
in by the dozens to take out books which
are listed in the regular library form.
The* little ones want showy picture books

habit of reading is not easily formed, but
when once strong, 13 exceedingly hard to
break. .

the most pleasure is the library, "We have
about 500 volumes, besides numberless

From the beginning of the trip to the
end. only a^few animals were seen, though
an occasional bear or a ' mountain ; sheep
was espied. ; During the first few days the
bears; were * ' comparatively â¢ numerous,
those creatures' having -: long made- the

-The last day 'was the saddest. "When
undergoing hardships men of ; the kind,
that composed this party are not down
hearted, and the â¢ greatest dancer is re
garded with* a smile. Any one's mishap.
On one day, during this last stage of tha
Journey the explorers were able to travel
only 1500 feet, nearly all of the distance
being over rocks where the boat had first
to be unloaded and then dragged. Into
this part of the "chasm it Is impossible for
any human being to enter alive except by/
the , way these "ftve men came. The wall/
rise to a height of just about half a mtÂ«
almost- vertically, and often there is ho
footing, on either side -of the river. One
cr two of the: party would go ahead J ex
amine the prospect in front of them for a
few : yards and - then Â¦ return to assist in
moving the boat At every 100 or 2fi feet,
sometimes, , ths boat had to be unloaded
and the outfit carried on the backs of, the
members of the party, bnt now and then
it happenedthat they could no longer find
any foothold, and under such circum
stances there was nothing to do but to
trust entirely , to the boat, taking the
chance of what a sharp turn in the stream
a short distance ahead might reveal.
â¢On the day before the last of the jour
ney the whole party got a ducklnsr, the
boat being caught in a whirlpool and sub
merged. : Similar accidents happened more
than once on the .trip, making it neces
sary, to land, build a fire and dry the
clothes and bedding. Most unfortunately,
many photographs which had been taken
.were destroyed "by the wetting of -the
films. v ' .. â¢ -. Â¦Â¦-
happened on ths seventh day. when Hovey
fell from a bowlder, striking on his head
and receiving a severe scalp wound.
" The first . fourteen dgys of the trip were
the easy Â¦ ones, relatively speaking, ten of
the fourteen : miles j being . covered in that
period;" .Seven days were, consumed in
traveling the remaining four, miles. Only
cne serious accident occurred. : and -. Uils

\ A peculiar and ; quite unfamiliar birJ
*Tras found in the canyon, which excited
the curiosity of the / members v of ; the
expedition. They, describe, it as a weinl
'sort of- feathered creature, ; which ; sought
,the solitude of the very darkest part of
the gorge. ' What it actually was nobody
can say. though the abyss is known' to be
.'inhabited -by several species or owls â ions
eared owls, little screechowls, big horned
owls, and the great sawwhet owls,,wnich
last get * their name' from their strange
â¢ cry.' which * sounds like ' the ' sharpening . of
, a saw. Another . bird . that finds its home
in the canyon is Townsend's Sol!tat:a,
which hasa peculiar and melancholy
note. A\notion;of the tumultuous char
acter>of the Gunnison "River; is obtained
from the fact that- its -waters, as they
: flow, through. the gorge; are without, -fish,
.being, too rough even for the hardy moun
tain trout;, which are supposed to revel In
any . torrent.'-, .".Â¦ y Â¦Â¦..,<
tains â a costly enterprise which the resi
dents of the Uncompahgre Valley are de
termined to undertake if it is proved that
there is no other way to get water." .- . Â¦
Before going further, it may be well to
state that the exploration yielded con
clusive evidence of the impracticability
of the ditch plant. It.was found that the
walls of the canyon became steeper .- as
its depths were reached. The party was
twenty-one days in making a journey of
fourteen miles from the junction of the
Cimarron River; with the Gunnison, near
Cimarron station, and in. that distance
there were only five points at which it
would be possible for even the most ex
pert .cliff climber to scale the rocky walls
and get out of the gorge. The walls,
while only thirty feet apart ln places, are
from 2100 to 2600 feet high, and as a rule
are nearly perpendicular. In many places
there is not so much as a foothold to be
had, and were a ditch to Â»e, built, the
workmen would have to begin at the en
trance of the canyon and cut it out of the
solid rock all of the way. .;. Â»-.-
A glance at a map will show that the
Orunnison River, -which. pursues its tortu
ous way I along the bottom of the Black
canyon, eventually joins the Grand River,
an affluent of the- mighty Colorado. It
was the project of the expedition to fol
low the current of- the Â¦ stream .through
the gorge until, if they were successful in
making the passage, , they ' shonld reach
Delta station, beyond the further end. .
The party had two boats of very or
dinary pattern/ .whicn- were provided,
however, with extra keels to strengthen
the bottoms and enable them . to with
stand collisions with, rocks, while, for'an
additional precaution, the sides were
ribbed with iron . rods. At the bow- and
Btern ," each, boat were ; iron loops,
through, which a- rope could fce run for
letting the craft down rapids. The Larger
of the boats, named the City of Montrose,
was eighteen feet long and three feet
beam; empty It weighed Â¦ 400 pounds. The
other one was called the John C. Bell.
On, the second day of the voyage the
John' C. Bell â¢ was wrecked. <The larger
boat had been successfully .'.'whipped"
through a narrow ' rapid, when" it was
hauled up on the bank, and the explorers
returned to bring, the other one through.
They had let It down almost . the full
length of the cable when suddenly a
cross current caught, it, swinging it
around in such a manner that It fetched
up fore and aft, upon some bowlders be
tween which .the Â¦' current ran. In an
instant its sides were crushed and tl>e
fragments of. the wreck, with one-half of
the provisions and outfit, . were Â¦ carried
away. Not the' slightest trace * of tho
wreckage or of the lost articles was found
during the rest of the voyage. ' ?
In several places .the river disappears
entirely from sight, flowing under Â¦ huge
piles of bowlders, which have fallen from
the cliffs. Tearing ; beneath the - rocks
unseen, the water* makes a deafening
rear, at times so loud that two men stand
ing with hands clasped cannot make their
voices audible to each other. In. other
parts of the. canyon the stream flows. on
in awesome silence, the .' rock walls rising
so steeply and so far aloft as to exclude
the rays of the sun. "..- â¢ . ~ â¢ Â¦_ - â¢ . â¢
The explorers* sensations we're as if they
had been in- the depths of a mine, and,
looking up toward the sky at Â»full noon
day, they could see the stars shimmering
overhead as if it were midnight.
At on,e spot it was necessary to haul the
!f the Twrtlt Is rot aarious. is a subject of
joke, and the accidents which befell Cur
tis, the only tenderfoot of the expedition,
gave rise to much amusement, his inex
perience in boating causing him to be
called the "landlubber," a strange title for
a man to win 1400 miles from the seat and
more than a mile above sea level, but on
the last day, 'when it became obvious that
the trip could not be completed and must
â¢be abandoned, there was genuine sorrow.
After the hardships that had been en
dured, and " which would have disheart
ened less seasoned men, they realized,
that there was one part of the canyon
through which no means men can com
mand could possibly carry them. They
had come to a cataract sixty feet in
height, between precipitous walls of solid
rock of an altitude 90 tremendous as to ex
clude the sunlight at noon. On neither
side was there Â» possibility, of gaining a
footing by which to make the descent.
Even if . they , soulS manage to lower the.
boat ln safety, they would be unable to.
follow It. V
Nor was there any certainty, if they
passed the 'falls, that they could escape- -*
To return the way tney had come was im
possible. 'The boat could not be forced
back agJnst the current, and it was out
of the question to carry their provisions,
*ven if they had had enough to last them
on a. return trip. The canyon was only
thirty feet wide at the bottom, and above
ther* loomed the nearly vertical walla
whÂ«fl seemed likely to hem them ln for
*wr.
The situation seemed desperate enough.
5"o scale one of the walls was their only
salvation, and they did it. Everything was
'left behind. The boat was abandoned, and
with it the outfit, including prov'dlona
and ' water. There was not a dry eye In
the party as the explorers, Ju3t at day
break, bade farewell to the sturdy littlo
craft that had brought them through such
difficulties and dangers, and turned their
faces to the east wall of the gorge.
Stripped of all but necessary clothing,
'hey began a climb which lasted from
daybreak to 11 o'clock at night, at whicn
hour they had made the ascent to an ele
vation of 2S0O feet (just about half a mile)
on a 600 foot slope. That is to say; ihey
were but 60U feet back from the river and
?600 feet abore it. All of these hours they
had i:either food nor water.
At the top they found f Hernia, who pro
vided them with everything they needed.
Not yet daunted, they tried to ascertain
ff it would not be practicable to approach
the impassable falls from the other end
of the canyonâ i. e. from Delta Station.
This, they learned, would not be difficult
Â«p to a point within one and half mirea
of the cataractâ the Falls of Sorrow, as
the explorers named themâ but there
again was a stretch that could not ba
passed. They have not yet given up tha
enterprise, and this winter they will make
another attempt to reach the falÂ»3 from,
â¢the Delta end of the gorge, when the
river is frozen, starting out with ice hook3
and spiked boots, and carrying their out
fit on a sled.
On , * h Â« first <*ay out the boat which
carried the expedition was swamped all
the provisions being lost, and the voy
agers, fortunate to f escape with their
lives, abandoned the project.
The successful accomplishment of the
feat was reserved for five men, who set
out on September 10 last, with a deter
mination to go through the' canyon or
perish in the effort Their names were
"John H. Pel ton. J. A. Curtis. M F
Hovey, W. W. Torrence and E. B." An
derson. Pelton had been a pioneer In
the Yukon country ln early days, long
before the gold discoveries, and his com
panions, with the exception of Curtis
who was a civil engineer and relatively
a tenderfoot, were likewise hardened ad
. venturers, afraid of ' nothing In the way
of danger or difficulty. Two boats were
loaded with provisions, a cooking outfit,
surveyors' . instruments, a camera and
other necessaries, and thus equipped the
explorers set out upon their perilous
journey. ,
It was by no means a spirit of 'mere
dare-devil adventure that inspired the ex
pedition. The object of it was to find out
. If there was not some path by which the
Â¦waterB of the Gunnison; River could be
conducted "out of the tunnel and made to
irrigate the drought parched farms of the
neighboring region. It; was a" question
Â¦whether a "hillside ditch" might not be
buill In the chasm, so as to bring a por
tion-of the descending stream near the
tops of. the cliffs, and so save tunneling
three and a half miles through the moun-

Preparation^; for ;lKe Sixtk Arxiyual Meeting of tke
J ; A pacific â¢ Goast c i&tiorv
O-N- August 19 the polo players anrl
i their ponies : will show at Del
.Monte. This will be the sixth an-
meeting of the Pacific- Coast
Polo and Pony "Racing Association, and
elaborate plans are in, course for a gen
eral carnival of sport. So far the set pro
gramme accounts for six. 'full .days, but
there is every chance' of a' prolongation of
the meeting into the last week of the
month. . . - . .
Polo and polo pony racing have taken
the fancy of the wealthy young men of
California and it is extremely doubtful if
there, are better polo ponies or polo play
ers anywhere in this country. The River
side, Santa Barbara . and Burlingame
teams 1 are. composed of young men whose
dally occupation Is saddle sport. :â¢ They
ride cross country, .race or play polo day
after, day, and those who know say they
are "the equal of. any body, of horsemen
who take tt) the saddle, for pleasure and
sport. This year the "Southerners" will
not send teams to Del Monte. Several pf
the players will be at hand, though, and
from. them teams will be formed. :
Four days have been ; set aside for. polo
games. There* will certainly be enough
entries to form three teams and possibly
four. In that case regular tournaments
will be- arranged. Following the polo,
which ., is on the programme for August
19, 20.' 21' and 22, pony racing and steeple
chasing will be in order. Much pros
pective interest has been centered in the
pony races and the competition will be
keen; and strong.' Several ""of the Bur
lingame riders are breeders as well, and
lately a strong rivalry has sprung up be
tween "Walter Hobart and - Frank Carolan
in their endeavors to seevh-e the best
ponies for polo- and racing. Tom Driscoll
Is another who 'owns- a fine lot of polo
ponies. In former years these same ponies
were rather cheap affairs. Bought up any
where for small sums, they, were trained
for the game and not one out of ten was
worth anything. It is very different now.
The polo pony of to-day is in reality a
small thoroughbred racehorse. Hobart re
cently sold one for J3500. The Blingumites
are new paying as much as $300 or J40O for
high class pony stock. So something new
and better is expected in polo ponle3 when
the meet opens at Del Monte. '
For ponies to be eligible to allraces for
polo ponies they must have been played
in the Del Monte polo tournament of 1301
at least during two full periods.
Besides polo and racing there will bo
golf and tennis and possibly yachting. The
golf programme is as follows: August
19â Men's amateur competition for the Del
Monte cup. Qualifying rounds at eighteen
holes, medal play. The contestants lrak
ing the best sixteen scores will play e's^t
een holes, match play, until but two com
petitors remain, who . will then play tfco
final round of thirty-six* holes, match
play, on successive days.
Entries for the Del Monte cup should be
made on or before August 20, addressed
to the golf committee, Pacific Coast Polo
and Pony Racing Association, Hotel del

retired and the management of the yacht
has been turned over to her owner, Frank'
Stone. The members of the committee did
not agree as to what changes should be
made in the .sloop, two of them wishing to
put all her ballast outside, while the third
thought it best to leave the yacht as she Is
and try no experiments so near the day
of the race. The inside ballast of the de

she will be fitted with a. tiller Instead of a

CARNIVAL OF SPORTS FOR THE

curious mixture of cowardice and
il daring, for it will fly at the sight

to enter them, says London Field.

seizes the weapon with its teeth; pulls It
out of the injured part and hurls it far
away. Sometimes, but by no means in
variably. It will turn upon Its assailant.
Quickly it receives another spear, or bird
arrow, from a second kayak man,' from
whom he turns after treating his weapon
In the same manner and sometimes
breaking It. and in this way the struggle
is continued until the bear Is overcome.
The most important precautionary^ rule
which the hunters have to observe is.
when during the fight the animal has
dived, to keep a sharp eye down into the
water In order. thaV'It .may not come up
unawares right under a, kayak. Its white
gleam can always be seen when it ap
proaches the surface, and there is time to
gat away if it be coming too near. When
a bear is encountered in the water or
amid somewhat 1 scattered ice its capture
Is considered a certainty, for, although an
excellent swimmer, it cannot get away
from, a kayak. In the northern colonies,
where they are . seldom seen, the Green
landers appear to be afraid of them," but
such is far from being the case in the Ju
lianshaab district, where,, in the water,
at any rate, they. are considered as much
less dangerous than the walrus or the
hooded seal. ; -â¢â¢..* ~. *
The food of bears consists mainly of
seals, which, however, they cannot seize
in the water, but only when lying on the
shore or on" ice, but as. the -seal, when In
such positions, is extremely watchful and
wary, the stalk is of ten fruitless, and the
bear is obliged more frequently than suits
It to depart with an empty stomach. Car
rion they take at any time. In summer
they rob birds'- nests of eggs Â¦ and young
ones, and appear, to be partial also to ber
ries. Probably, too, they live upon sea
fowl, seizing them from below while rest
ing on the water. According to Brehm,
their ordinary food Is fish, and they even
capture salmon in the^ sea. ' This, however,
I have never had confirmed by. the Green
landers, who all consider that the -bear's
powers of swimming! would not | be equal
to it. J According to the same authority,
neither reindeer, foxes nor birds are safe
from the polar j bear, but this, I think, is
a mistake. Nature has- intended that it

should seek its prey in the water and on
the Ice rather than on the land.
When really hungry, there are" few
things which a bear will reject,- down to
old skin garments and tarred ropes" ends"
which I may sometimes be found in its
stomach. It is .under such circumstances
that it ventures close to the huts and de
vours whatever it can find, sometimes at
tempting to enter. In the winter of 1896-7
a. bear was shot at Godhaven. with . the
whole of the fore part of the body In. an
oil cask, which it was licking. In the Ju
llanshaab district it is not unusual for
these animals to : visit the- Greenlanders'
provision stores, where they keep' their
dried seals' flesh, v etc, tear the stones
away from . the entrance and clear the
place completely, out. â¢. V-

li constructed steamer, Ice protected
' - and of. high engine power, so that

Peary's. way. to "reach the' pole^ which he
fully 'set forth In his American geograph
ical paper; January 12, ,1897, : which the
society's ' committee approved . and | on tha
lines, of" which Â¦ his : present Is
conducted, has both common sense and
experience J in j 1 ts * favor. / Had Uhe Wind
ward; in August, 1898, reached her destina
tion at Sherrard Osborne fiord, there's. no
telling 'that Peary - might ! not that very
winter", and the next spring have Â¦ pushed
on to the goal. One element of the polar ;
problem, and one of ten. lost sight of, 3
the necessity of return, for no one wishes,
to 'remain there, and there's no thing, be
yond to go: to or for. Therefore /'the
traveler must stop whenever his food for
men and dogs is reduced . to the limit
which will bring him back to the starting
point." In this fact. In the reduction of
the known distance to the minimum, lies
the essential merit and the certainty of
Peary's methods.
It was not always remembered that no
explorer ever stopped going north because
he could go no farther. . Markham ' of the
British expedition had to turn to save the
lives of his â¢ scurvy-stricken comrades:
Lockwood and Brainard had . beaten the
Englishman's farthest and placed their
country's flag in the van, seeing a great,
gray mountain still beyond; while Captain
Cagril, at his hitherto unsurpassed eighty
six degrees thirty-nine minutes and forty
four seconds, last April' reported the
travel steadily improving as he advanced
northward. Every one of these courageous
and able men reached his limit and turned
about simply by the inexorable necessity
of subsistence homewa^. As Admiral
Melville, veteran of many arduous Arctic
campaigns, says: "If one could stop at a
hotel every night anybody could go to tha
pole."
And so, a9 the army is said, to mova on
its belly, does the food factor determine
the working out of the w.hole polar prob
lem. And here is where -the greatest
change of all has been effected. Modern
methods have made food preservation a
Bimple and certain matter, and there is
no longer a shadow of excuse for a de
fective Arctic dietary. Money will buy
foodâ all that is wanted and Just what Is
wanted; it will build and man steamers
such as experience proves are needed and
effective. Add to these American pluck
and common sense, and Is there any rea
sonable doubt remaining of "How to reach

You should' study carefully the position

In driving the position of each hand
should be easy and natural, the wrist and

"When Reformer Stevenson was driving
the Brighton Age in England in 1S30 he
put forth every effort to make coaching
popular: in a measure he was successful.
A man of some distinction and of good
family, he soon won his friends over, and
not many months later there was seen in
t* e "box," holdicg the reins, Sir St. Vin
cent Cotton. This gentieman grew fond
of the sport and quickly became skilled.
In Jiandlirg the "ribbons." Then In a
spirit of emulation other notables of his
acquaintance (among whom were tha
Duke of Beaufort and Lord Chesterfield)
took up the sport.
Thi3 led to the invention of fancy turn
outs and new modes of driving, among
which was the tandem.
Prior to the advent of Mr. Sievenson
the much-abused box was occupied by tha
rosy-nosed, water-eyed cockney, who ap
preciated his "art" about as much as a
gatepost. Scientific driving was unknown
!n their time. The curb chain was an In
strument of torture to the noble beasts
that dragged the coach.
The mail coach was driven through tha
villages with such reckless speed that tha
unfortunate passengers who rode on top
had to hold on for their lives. Running
over a villager was a common event.
With the victim struggling In thÂ© road,
the driver would lash up the leaden and
croak. "The willage folk are werry stu
pid, werry"; then with, another cut at thÂ«
almost terror-stricken leaders would
promptly forget all about the Incident.
This type of character Is often seen on
English, roads and even in London to-day; -
but, thanks to progress, his manner Is not
so brutal as in days of old.
"When "coaching" and tandexxt driving:
became so popular In England tha sport
was taken up with Interest by the swell

You may use ponies or horses. Just as
your fancy suggests, but for my own en^
joyment 1 prefer ponies, am they are
quicker. As a rule they arÂ« more suited
to tandem "work than the larger animals.
However. It Is mere difficult to find per.
lection In th*t former. One should upend
la the first place the beginner should
learn to drive one horse scientifically and
well, then he should add another, trying
ell manner of turns and tricks; then,
when thoroughly master of two, bring
out your third pony; now, usually. If you
become au fait in driving three you can
hand!*- five Just as easily.
,ks my suggestions might -aid the young
hortâ¬tnan who desires to drive a many
ponied tandem. I will dedicate the fol
lowing instructions to him:
This Ehculd not d!?couragre the am
bitious driver, as the feat is ; easy of
execution. The Â¦whole secret of my sup
eees lies in the fact that I follow no set
rules; that my harness is designed and
arranged under my own supervision: not
through the instructions of those who do
little driving and stay at home and write
books on the subject. My method is that
Â¦which should be adopted by all. for It is
original and thoroughly American.
Some people possess an even tempera
ment, steady nerves and good common
eense. I am fortunate enough to possess
a sufficiency of each of these virtues to
handle with much pleasure and equal
success a ten-pony tandem. I understand
that mine is the only outfit cf the kind
la the world. /
Oar pessimistic friends are shocked
Â¦when they see the ten-pony tifndem"
racing down Market street: they predict
6Ome disaster, calling the driving in ona
breath recklessness and nerve unlimited.
Those who oppose this style of driving
are either ignorant of the subject or theii
method of handling the reins has caused
them trouble. Nearly all accidents to
tandems are due to carelessness or in
Â«fficiency on the part of the driver.
THERE are plenty of people who
say tnat the most dangerous motif
of conveyance ever Invented by
man Is the tandem. They tell you
that the driver has little command
over the leader: that a tandem cart 13
easily overturned, and when making a
sharp turn you cannot see very well
â¢what the leader is doing. In fact, one
must expect to be landed unceremoniously

But while she watched the Scotchman's
money fly she resoived to marry him snd
to do it in double quick time. After tho
knot was tied good and tight she would
be afraid of no man. So in June a rival
boarding-house commenced, and it was
run by one Sandy Bowers and his Utah
bride.
The scene of many festivities changed.
The dancing and the merry Jingle fol
lowed the pretty girl, but the money that
was forthcoming didn't always find its
way there.
"Give you fifty feet of my mine to
square my board bill," one fellow said,
and Sandy said "All right."
So fifty feet of the Comstodc's richest
ground was given in lieu of the money.
And that is where Sandy Bowers made
his money.
It was at a miners' ball that Sandy Bow
â¢ ers, a Scotch miner, met and wooed the
girl who afterward became his wife.
These balls, by the way, lasted three days
snd three nights and there was ample
time to become fairly well acquainted.

Although Sandy was engaged, there
was a fellow In that camp who knew too

Sandy's "lady" to give him a pack of

watched her former rriend fleece her

before them and wine flowed until none
of them could tell whether it was a ruby;
red or a beautiful sparkling amber. "Eat.
drink and be merry" was the motto that
was so extravagantly carried out And
well they might be merry, for they ate
to the tune of $5000.
Not to show partiality Sandy tripped
merrily over to Gold Hill and banqueted
his friends there. The money bag that
he left as a reminder contained $2500.
And then the Bowers were ready to con
quer Europe.
Their fair weather friends pelted them
with roses, and a Mexican band of four
pieces played a pathetic farewell. They
rendered the piece in such a soul-rend

put his hand into his $25,000 has. filled

$200 with hi3 most grateful thanks.

'things that* were to be, and so in this
way she was posted as to the future. Her
first great hit in fortune-telling was made
in 1869 at the time of the burning of tha
Yellow Jacket mine.
"I told you I saw a black cloud hover
ing over the Yellow Jacket and saw
widows In black all about ic," she taunted
the skeptics.
The proof was there!
Mrs. Sandy Bowers had looked into the
future and had predicted the awful ca
lamity that had befallen the mine.
"She Is a .seeress," some cried.
"The Washoe Seeress is her proper
name," exclaimed others, and the Wa3hoe
' Seeress she has been called ever since.
She communed at first with Sandy, not
for silver, but for glory. Time after time
she influenced the boards, and for a while
her prophecies came true. When she said
"boom," boom it was. .
But all this time she was living in a
costly' way. Thousands were thrown
about like so many dollars: dinners and
parties were frequent and astonishing to
ths people who' were' used to plenty.
Such willful waste will quickly reduce
any fortune, and ' the Washoe Seeress
soon refused to divujg'e any of her secrets
until her palm had been crossed with a
round 3ilver dollar. As all good things
have an end, so ' did her streak of good
luck. Eeither that or Sandy's spirit wan

San Francisco by Henry Miller. Its worth
has hardly been tested' as yet. ' \
Although we talk- of the "Washington
atmosphere" in these pieces, Washington
himself does not appear in any of them.
Experiments in that line , have always
proved failures. There was a. play called

part of hero. He was rather too much of
the drawing room type for as stirring a
play as that.. â¢
The same applies far more forcibly to
John Drew, in ."Richard Carvel." The
public simply wouldn't have him in colo
:r.ial costume. John has set fashions for
tailoring and haberdashery too lojig for
the public to bear with him in knicker
bockers. If he is brandishing a sword
with one hand you expect to see him bal
ance a teacup with the other. So he had
a sorry time with- a part that, should have
been given to Hackett, that was, meant
for Hackett; and . that Hackett was born
purposely for if ever man was. He wouid
have been idolized in the role by night as
well as by matinee, for his delightful per

"Betsy. Ross," in which "Washington to
the life appeared; the man who played
the part had a perfect make-up and his
work was dignified and appreciative; but
the public wouldn't stand for it. It has
been the same old story with Lincoln.
Those two men are our two national
heroes, and we have made them sort of
sacred myths that can't be represented
on the stage without a jar to our pa.tri
otic sensibilities.
That is why, in spite of the raging fad,
none of those plays can last. They had
popular successes, for the people were
ready to swallow anything that swash
buckled in the time of "Washington; but
the critics were hard on all of them. They
held big possibilities,-, but these possibili
ties were, sadly neglected. . - r
"Janice Meredith" gave a pretty part to
Mary Mannering, in which she opened her
career as a star. Janice is a' charming
girl, and Miss Mannering was able to give
the ' role '. all the charm it deserved ; ' but
the play as a- whole was weakly worked
out. . Fine ' dramatic situations were
missed, characters were flimsily devel
oped. In spite of all this, though, the play
had a big run and reached the point of
success where the Janice Meredith curl
was a part of fashionable halrdressing,
and that was a sign that couldn't be over
looked. , /
"To Have and to Hold" was prayed prin
cipally by Miss Isabel .Irving and Robert
Lorraine, a young actor whom Mr. Froh-
I suppose' the whole secret was that the
reaction from the problem play had not
arrived. Artificial studies of decadent so
ciety were then a raging ' fadâ they were
ttn de siecle, they were wearisome, but
they were popular. It is only now that
the public has grown -thoroughly, sick or
that- sort of thing and is clamoring for
wholesome plays. If those old plays of
Carleton's could be revived this season
they ought to make big hits.
The most of the group of Revolutionary
dramas have been written from novels,
and the fad for these novels has perhaps
been directly responsible for the dramatic
fad; but nevertheless it must have come
of itself. Theater-goers are sick of the
morbid. They want good, sane, sound
heroism and love. ' : . â¢ -
"A - Colonial Girl" was produced when
the fashion was still in its mlanoy. two
years ago. It never made a great success
in New ifork. It has been vroduted in this
city and did wellâ Miss Jul.a Dean in the
Neill Company made- the hit of the. piece.
"Janice Meredith, To Have and to
Hold" and "Richard Carvel" have been
the reigning ones of the past season. The
books trom wbich they were written all
have good dramatic material in them; out
the best of that was not used in the
dramatizations. .They 'were written for
Frohman lÂ»y a man named Rose, and the
way that Rose slammed those plays to
gether got to be a standing joke at the
club. Anything goes, so long as it moves
in the Washington atmosphere, was the
motto that. Rose went on; and we used
to ask him when he came in: â¢
"How many plays have you written this
afternoon. Rose?" â¢
That's as much work as he usually puts
on themâ an afternoon.
â¢ "Ye Early Trouble" was the beginning
of the thing and Henry Guy Carleton was
the man who v/rote it. Carleton seems
now to have been a prophets-but when he
launched "Ye Early Trouble" the time
was by no means ripe 'for it. " It made
trouble enough, true to its name; for after
a fairly good opening in Boston it was
taken to New York, where it fell with
the thud of a rocket stick and left Â¦ only
ercpty pocketbooks behind â¢ it. :
THE Revolutionary play Is not as new
a thing as it passes for. As a mat
ter of fact, it dates back something
like a decade and does not have its
origin in the swashbuckling novel,

But a little success in San Francisco did
not make the play, so it disappeared and
was relegated to some dark pigeon-hole in
Mr. Carleton's desk. A few years later
he tried another play of the same kind;
this died, too.

in the East last season, but I couldn't get

An.l I verily believe that play was the

N. W.. WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â
Acting Secretary Hackett will
announce on Monday the name of
the officer who will be designated
to fill the vacancy in the Schjey court of
inquiry. It has been expected that the
announcement would be made to-day. The
delay is caused by the difficulty of getting
an officer willing to accept the duty. Rear
Admiral Kimberly was relieved because
of 111 health. Hackett is now in corre
spondence with another officer. He de
clines to make public his name in advance
of the official announcement. The choice
probably lies between Belknap and Kautz.
It is positively declared that Rear Admi
ral Luce, retired, will not serve as a mem
ber of the court. Â¦ .
"Osman had $10,000 of stock, while Bau

their accounts,, being unwilling ; or un
able to put in cash. The company will
be doing business again, there Is no ques

name. It probably; will take a week- to
straighten out the books. -No other stock
holders are indebted to the company.

Phillips was seen to-night and .. con

ket.

When the Amalgamated men left him
President Schwab went at once*to the of
fice of J. P. Morgan and had a talk with
Bacon. He went home early, in the
afternoon, as did all the * other
men â¢ who . represented the corporation
in the final debate of the issues which di
vide them and their men. It was evident
that they expected nothing to come from
the second meeting of the Amalgamated
representatives, then In progress. No
statement In behalf of the steel corpora
tion was made and none of its represent
atives would talk for publication..
It is believed here that there" will be im
mediate action from both sides, the ex
pectation being that the steel corporation
will attempt the operation of some of it3
mills independent of the union and that
.the Amalgamated Association will call
upon those in sympathy with them to
strike.- If- there are no. further efforts at
conciliation and the strike is extended It
may develop into the â¢ largest conflict of
the kind in the history of the country.
Figures at this time as to the number of
men and properties that would be in
volved are pronounced unreliable by con
servative men who know the trade, be
cause many, of the. claims of strength put
forward on either side are disputed and
can i be tested only in actual conflict.
â¢Just before 'leaving for Pittsburgh to
night Ellas Jenkins of the Amalgamated
Association said: â¢
,â¢; "All negotiations with the United States
Steel Corporation are closed so far as our
association ] Is concerned. We came here
this k morning with plenary powers and
hopeful that the present conference- would
mark the close of the struggle, which has
meant loss both to employes and employ
ers. ',- We return now to our various head
quarters to renew the struggje. Now tha
matter iwill be fought to a final issue un
less vwe are sent for by the officials of tha
corporation." -
President Shaffer declined to say a -word
in addition to the formal statement which
was given out by Williams, and his com
panions were equally reticent. Shaffer
asked that the statement be printed In
full, saying that the strikers wished the
public to understand their position. Not
an intimation of the future policy of the
Amalgamated Association in waging the
great industrial battle which it faces
could be drawn from any member of the
party. Shaffer seemed grave and serious
despite the vindication which his associ- .
ates gave him in their official statement,
while the other Amalgamated men seemed \
in very high spirits. Shaffer paid the bill
for the party at the hotel and left, saying
that he intended to take the first train to-
Plttsburg.

failed to reach an agreement. The second

two hours, at the close of which the fol- ;

That the officials of the United States

for this battle was made apparent during
this afternoon. It was learned on the
best of authority that an attempt is to be
made at once to break the strike by the
Importation of non-union men into all the

panies now involved said that eo far as

was concerned it is only necessary to dis
tribute the skilled workers in the present

them general instructors of green hands

tradesmen.
of the Amalgamated Association and the
general officers of the big trust. Two
messages came. The tirst stated that the
conference between the workers and Mor
gan had adjourned after receiving Mor
gan's ultimate decision in the matters in
dispute. An hour before this time a sec
ond message came to Pittsburg announc

ecutive board had decided they would not

The second message contained the state
ment also that appears in the foregoing.
Some of the officials heard the message
with misgivings, others with unconcealed
satisfaction. One of the officials left his

The tight would surely be carried to a fin

LONDON, Aug. 3.â In great contrast
with the favorable comments elicited here
by the contribution of Â£5000 to the Queen
Victoria memorial fund by the delegates
of the New York Chamber of Commerce
who recently visited London, is the. anger
with which the Duke of .Orleans' contri
bution of Â£100 has been received. The St.
James Gazette thinks the Duke's action
is astounding impudence, and, in common
with the Daily Chronicle, urges the Lord
Mayor to reject this contribution on ac
count of the part which the Duke of Or
leans took in the caricatures of Queen
Victoria which appeared in the newspa
pers of Paris. The same paper says the
New Yorkers' sift "emphasizes in a dig
nified and graceful manner the feeling
which, we are sure, is general in the

The correspondent hears from Bayreuth
that the people generally have refused to
sign the petition asking for. a prolonga
tion of the "Parsifal" monopoly. The
Anzeiger, a newspaper printed at Hof,
says that Albert Nelaiann has advised
Frau Cosima Wagner, "widow of the com
poser, to have a Bayreuth opera every
year for five years to place the undertak
ing upon a firm financial basis, and that
a plan has been accepted for the perform
ance of the opera again in 1902. Other
papers reproduce the above with reserve.
Tho writer of the editorial asks who
will bf: frightened by Russian "big talkj'
when it is remembered that Russia has
only the German market for her surplus
of ryii. An Austro-Russian tariff alliance
against Germany is impossible, since Aus
tria herself exports grain. The writer
further points out that the United States
is far loss ignorant about the tariff bill
than the. German Liberal press wishes.
In this connection the Vossische Zeitung
prints a cable dispatch, from New York
saying that Embassador White advises
Washington to tend Rockhill here as his
successor to handle -the tariff question. A
correspondent wrote to White on the sub
ject and received a telegraphic reply say
ing: "Nothing : known/ here about, the
matter." ' ' \ . : .
Regarding the bill passing the Keichs
tag, it is recognized that the balance of
power wili rest with the Centrist party.
Theiefore the Bon-Centrist press this
week has been eagerly watching' for indi
cations as to the Centrists' attitude. The
Centrist paper?, however, carefully ab
stained from committing themselves. 'But
now the Cologne Yolks Zoitung prints an
editonsl, which is beisg telegraphed all
over the country, coming out strongly for
the tariff bill. The editorial admits that
some -duties may be changed and some,
perhaps, .further increased, but .the
Centrists are leady to support the measure

WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.-The State De

Squires, secretary of legation at Peking;
a note from Li Hung Chang, describing
the regulations for the control of the
mounted patrol which *t is proposed lo
establish along the road between Ching
tlng and Paotingfu. Squires says this is
the first step on the part of the Chinese
authorities toward the protection of for
eigners traveling through the disturbed
districts of the province of Shansi and
Chili. The regulations are quaintly ex
pressed, but in substance they provide for
the establishment of military posts at nine
stations on the road, the commanders of
which- are to furnish escorts for travelers.
The escort is to keep within twelve feet
of the travelers, whose pace must set
theirs. .It is to disperse people v/hb
gather about the travelers and are bols
lercus, and its members are not' to accept
any pay from a traveler under pain of
dismissal. A post will be forwarded
every two days.

SEATTLE, Aug. 3.â Advices brought
defwn on the steamship Humboldt, which
arrived, .from . Skaguay .this '. morning,'
give meager details of a horrible mas
sacre of five men committed by Indians
on the "Valdes trail. :.;.:..,._
The advices do not give the names 'of
the victims. The news was brought to
Juneau by the steamer Newport,' which
arrived there July 30, the day before the
Humboldt sailed. The officers' of the New
port said that the names of the five men
had not â¢ been procured when the boat
left Orca, and from the scant information
received at that time little could be
learned of the details of the tragedy. ' '
The crime was committed at. a point
about 200 miles from Valdes in the in
terior, r'.. - .-
Another tale of horror from- Valdes is
that an unknown man was > found on ( the
trail almost dead from starvation and'ex
posure. He was discovered by prospec
tors, who took him into their .camp and
fed him. The man declared that he had

"The real object of my trip out here is
to make a scientific Investigation of-, the
prop conditions of the Middle West. By
scientific I do not mean an estimate of
the financial loss or the decrease of the
crop . product caused . by the recent
drought, but I want to see if something
cannot be done to lessen the destructive
ness of droughts. I am satisfied that by
means of scientific study In the agricul
tural sphere a way can be devised where
by the loss to the farmer by drought can
be materially lessened. I have not yet
reached a conclusion as to how this can
be done, but the results of my investiga
tions will be given out on my return to
Washington. I first noticed the effect of
the drought when I struck Indiana. From
there west as far as I have been the dam
age is quite perceptible. I went to Omaha
and Lincoln first that I might have an op
portunity to see the condition of the crops
In Southern Iowa, as I had heard that
they were hurt the worst. From what I
have seen from the crops around Sioux
City I think they are in much better con
dition than those in the southern part of
the State. It is impossible for me to esti
mate the extent of the loss. That will
be given out In the, monthly bulletin,
which will be Issued August 10. I am go
ing from here through Minnesota to St.

LONDON, Aug. -8.â A number of of
ficials of Liberia have arrived in England
for the purpose of endeavoring to procure
from. Great Britain the right to navigate
the Manna River, which separates Liberia
from Sierra Leone. The. delegation, which
consists of Secretary of the Treasury Bar
clay, Chief Justice Roberts : and Senator
King, who was the Liberian Commis
sioner to the World's Fair, have had an
interview with Colonial Secretary Cham
berlain, and negotiations to secure the de
sired right are now in progress. Barclay,
who has -held office for about twenty
years, in speaking of the matter to-day
said: . :: / Â¦ ' 'Â¦
Liberia is progressing well. Thanks to the
firm stand of the United States and Great
Britain we are untroubled with European ag
gression, though, -to tell the- truth, we are
rather afraid of Germany, as she is bo patent
ly on the lookout for colonies. However, I don't
think she will get a chance to appropriate our
country." I understand that steps are on foot In
New York for the formation of an American
line to West Africa. I believe It will.be an
advantageous undertaking, as 'the oils, timber
and such" products, now Â¦ used . In- Liberia Â¦ and
other West African countries come from Amer
ica, but by way. o^ England. : -A -direct, service
would obviate this . miscarriage of profits. Re
turn freights are still scarce, tmt with the rapid
development of Â¦ the country's . mining interest
this difficulty should, shortly be. overcome,
while rubber Is always plentiful. There Is gold
in Liberia and a . company has already been
formed to develop the mines.
Financially Liberia' is progressing. One hun
dred thousand .pounds would wipe out all her
debts.. Considering that we have not received
any financial assistance, except from American
colonization, Liberia's standing compares fa
vorably with that of any West African State.
"- We are getting little negro immigration from
the United States. At present, Indeed, â¢ it is
hard for immigrants to get work, for the na
tives are willing to work for $3 a month. Later
there will be plenty of opportunities for those
cognizant of mining matters. If American ne
groes would take. up this branch they would
have a great . future â¢ on the West Coast, where
they can stand the climate twice as well aa a
white man. We are working slowly and stead
ily in the endeavor to find â¢ a common basis of
government for our civilized and native popula
tions. The latter number over a -million.- We
are endeavoring to avpld the mistake so patent
in the Crown colonies around us of forcing our
ideas upon the natives. Â¦ A gradual assimilation
of customs is the only way of. dealing with the
problem, and how successful : we have been can
be judged by the fact -that we have no organ
ized police force, and. often no serious criminal
caseo occur in six months' time. Â¦'.-Â¦Â¦:Â¦â¢
Barclay, says the Liberians were very
glad to hear that it was proposed to're
establish the American squadron of war
ships in European waters, though there
was no harbor in Liberia at. present fitted
for a coaling- station. -*â¢ Â¦/

Miss Moore spent the aay at a local ho

direct for San Francisco.
Miss Moore was indignant and made ud
her mind to Immediately return to her
California home. She did not have enough
money, however, and bravely went to
work as matron of the Dawson jail. In
that manner she secured quite a sum of
money, enough to psy her fare to the-out
t-ide. In the meantime Miss Moore started
fait for breach of promise against the rich
captain. That suit is still pending In the
Dawson courts. She asked for $25,000 for
the alleeed broken promise.
Miss Moore made the trip from San
Francisco to Dawson. nearly 3003 miles,
alone. She had worked the previous sum
mer tor a large company at Kome as sten
ographer, and there met the captain. A
passing acquaintance soon ripened lnto'a
better understanding and the captain pro
posed to the pretty stenographer. She
accepted him and they formally an
nounced their engagement of marriage.
Finally duty called Captain Bledsoe up
the Yukon, where he took charge of the
large river steamer Susie, one of the best
boats on the Yukon River. Miss Moore
returned to her home in San Francisco.
The lovers, though parted, wrote regular
ly, and by letter it was arranged that
Miss Moore should make the trip alone
to Dawson. where she should wed the
captain. Securing her trousseau she
started, and after considerable difficulty
reached the Klondike metropolis. There
the found her promised husband -with an
other bride.

. WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â Mr. Tracewell,
the Comptroller of the Treasury, in. a de
cision rendered to-day holds that Henry
Gannett, the present geographer of the
eleventh census, was illegally approved,
and hence Is not entitled to compensation.
Gannett also holds the positipn of geogra
pher in the Geological Survey, and the de
cision of the Comptroller of the Treasury
is based on the -law which inhibits anv
person from holding two positions under
the Government the compensation of
either" of which is $2500 or more per an
num. Gannett was appointed to his posi
tion in the census "without compensa
tion," presumably with a view to asking
Congress to authorize the payment of the
salary in case the Comptroller should de
cide that he was not entitled to it under
the present law. Although he does not
decide the point, the Comptroller raises
the question whether Gannett's present
salary of $3600 as geographer of the Geo
logical Survey" is not $1100 in excess of the
amount authorized by Congress.

BUTTE. Mont., Aug. 3.â This city la a
strong union city, one of the best in the
United States, and it was supposed that
every trade at work here was unionized.
A new union, however, is in fierce, which
promises to give the others cards and
spades and then beat them out. It is an
organization of working girls, called the
Women's Protective Union. It has been
working quietly, but now is ready for
business, and has laid down the law -to
employers. Every boarding house, hotel
and restaurant in Butte will be brought
into the fold if possible, and as these In
stitutions are supported by union men
the employers will have to come to time.
All union men have been requested to see
if the girl who waits on them wears the
badge, a neat one designed for the union.
Each member is .also given a working
card, and all employers of female help
have been requested to demand her card
from every girl applying for a job. House
wives are alarmed, for the servant prob
lem is at all times a hard one in this inde
pendent city. This organization of domes
tics will be a sad blow to them. Miss
Maggie Kangas is business agent and . is
doing good work. She is also sentinel.

Of various infractions of military pro
priety, it was frequently noticed, says the
report, that officers and enlisted men to
gether visited drinking saloons and treat-'
ed each other to. intoxicants at public
bars. This, says Colonel Wilhelm, at
once shows the entire absence of a proper
understanding of their duties as officers
and enlisted men. Military efficiency, he
says, is out of the question where such
familiarity is permitted.
The â¢ report declares that official chan
nels are more or less Ignored and reports,
returns, requests and requisitions are not
sufficiently scrutinized in transmission.
The report is in some respects an ar
raignment of the methods which obtain
in the administration of the citizen sol
diery. ..: It observes that the animals?: of
some . of the mounted troops were very
irregularly fed, so much so that their ser
vice might have been regarded asjdoubt
ful. Upon inquiry as to the cause it was
found that the issue of hay and straw
was distributed 1 to the animais without
any regard to the regulation allowance
per animal, resulting in over and under
feeding. For this, declares Colonel Wil
helm, the detachment commanders are re
sponsible and should be held for inatten
tion. .. , .-
The neglect to pack' up the tent pins at
the breaking of camp 'is characterized as
unpardonable carelessness and should
have been looked into by the regimental
quartermasters. The cooking was de
clared to be good, although in some of
the kitchens considerable food was wast
ed. The complaints of lack of supplies
were found unworthy of attention.
Colonel Wilhelm observes that the term
militia, as applied by law to the force of
the State, seems to be unfortunate. ' It is
now hardly synonymous with the highest
meaning of the word military, and in
modern times has come to signify the un
disciplined domestic forces subject to be
called for the defense of the nation in its
very last extremity.

judgment "was afterward found to be cor

jected to sending troops to Cuba during
the hot weather. Notwithstanding his ad
vice, however, the War Department went
ahead, and as a result we lost many, men
who might have been saved had the expe
dition been put off a few months. The
result of Miles' Santiago campaign, with
the slight loss of men, proved the cor

SEATTLE, Aug. Â£â Ralph L.' Ross, a.
stamp clerk In the office of the local Dep
uty Collector of Internal Revenue, is short
in his accounts to the amount Â¦ of $4000.
Unless: the shortage Is made good to-mor-'
row- mbrnlng,> of .which there, seems- no
hope, his -and /prosecution by. the
Government officers will follow. L .. ;. â¢
Ross has held the office for' something
more than a year. .He was sergeant-major
of the First Washington Volunters and
has an excellent^'record for service in the
Philippines. It was in view of his service
and gener.al popularity that he was given
the political appointment.'*- He now. tells
a- story 'that- Is only partially, believed.-
Freely admitting that lie ; has spent the
money he says that he first took a small
amount to -pay "some debts incurred in a
business venture' prior to' his jj appoint
ment. : : ..
In the hope of making up this small
amount he took more and proceeded to
play- faro,- going* deeper and deeper into
the GovernmenTs money, until a few
days ago he was confronted by a short
age of nearly $4000. .
August 1, in accordance with the rules'
of the office, he had to deposit the receipts
for July in a local bank, subject to the
order of Collector David M. Dunne of
Portland, who has charge of the district'/
Ross appealed to friends for assistance.
On the strength of hiB, story that he had
lost at gambling, a strong effort, backed
by considerable political influence, . was
made to have the principal . gambling
houses of the city make good the I short
age. It was pointed out that Ross' arrest
and the publication of his story would
probably result in closing the gambling
houses. â¢ . . , â¢
' The gamblers protested that while Ross
had played he always quit a winner, but
for -a time it was thought Â¦'Â¦'- they * would
yield to the demand; in. fact, at one time
$3000 of the necessary amount .was as
sured. Then the gamblers changed their
minds, and decided 'to leave Ross to his
fate and trust to their luck against closed
houses. Â¦ 'Â¦:.-.>Â¦: . ' - . : . â¢ .
Ross* father, a respected pioneer,' but a
man of small means, has been endeavor
ing to' raise the amount.' but it said to
night " that he has v failed, and Ross will
probably be arrested to-morrow. .

, On ,the other side Buchanan said: "I say to you nowj out of the fullness of my experience,
that had I a son who thought of turning to literature as a means of livelihood, and whom I'cbuld
not dower with independent means to keep Barabbas and the markets at bay, I would elect, were
the choice mine, to save that son fromfuture misery by striking him dead witlrmy own hand." In
another place he says of "a literary man: "If his nature is in arms against anything that is. rotten;
â¢ in society or, in literature itself, he must be silent. Above all he must .lay this solemn truth to
heart, that- when the world speaks well of him the world-will demand the price of praise, and- that
price will possibly, be. his living; soul.-' ' , Â» : / .
Similar contrasts of view could be found among the workers- in ; any department of indus
try. There are people who would be content and cheerful under aÂ»y conditions, and others who ~
would complain in the halls of heaven. That Besatit's view of literary, -life ; in our. time is more :
rational than that of Buchanan ';canngt be questioned. There has never been a time when so many .
people could -read, when so many could afford to buy. books and. when authors fas' a ciassyvere
so, prosperous. Doubtless a writer who wishes to fight the world, arid expose what He' regards as
rottenness will. have a good many hard knocks to take, but a fighter, should, not be dismayed 'by
that fact. No one can be a reformer: and at tjtie same * time lie on .flowery beds. of ease.. The* - :
trouble With Buchanan seems to have been that he (thought' the world was demanding of him the
\ surrender of his soul when it really asked only^that he should write. entertainingly what the world
â¢ wished to read: ; ; / , , :": : -.' ;v â¢ . \ '* ' â¢' Â»
â¢ Besant wrote: "The literary life may be, I am firmly convinced, in spite of many, dangers and
drawbacks, by far the happiest life' that the Lord has permitted ..man to enjoy! I say Jhis
with' the greatest confidence and after considering the history of all. these literary men/ living or
dead, whom I have known and of whom I have read;'' :.;^f"
DISCUSSIONS upon/the lives and works of the late Sir Walter Besant and Robert Bu
chanan have brought to ; light the fact that the two authors took widely different '
views of literary life. To the one that life was a pastime, while to the other it seeim .
to have been something like a tragedy. Each attained; a high degree, of success, but
only one was satisfied. -The other regarded success itself as a kind of. degradation because of the -
efforts he had to make-to attain it-; . \, Â¦ . ' :
THE LITERARY LIFE.
A pleasant probability of the next Grau
grand opera season here in November, is
the giving of Massenet's "Manon Lefri
caut," with a further pleasure of hearing
the title role sung by a former San Fran
cieco stnger, Sybil Sanderson. Miss San
derson has not been heard here for many
years and, if I mistake not, "Manon"
never, and the conjunction, according to
Paris opinion, is something to delight.
Perhaps of all singers who have come out
of California Miss Sanderson is the most
famous. Her reception in Paris on her
appearance there, now some years ago,
was altogether exceptional, and her sub
sequent artistic career most brilliant;
Massenel, and Salnt-Saens were her ard-*
ent admirers, and besides "Manon" she
achieved renown ip the .
and "Phryne." She easily reaches G in
alt. and there Is no doubt as to her ar
tistry, beauty and temperament. Miss
Sanderson will be first heard in her na
tive city during the present tour!. Other
singers already engaged , by Mr. Grau are
Lilli Lehmann.: Anton Van Rooy and
Edouard de'Reszke. .
There is much more that is interesting
in the booklet, which is picturesquely and
clearly written and put up in dainty fash
ion by the Joseph Winterburn Company
of San Francisco, r
After reminding his readers that Berlioz
Included the mandolin in his list of legiti
mate instruments, that Mozart wrote a
mandolin accompaniment for. his "Deh
VienI," that the serenade in Verdi's
"Otello" is written for mandolins, and
various other mandolin claims to respect
ful consideration, the author tells in in
teresting fashion what ds being done to
day by. composers for and performers on
the instrument. The center of activity is
Italy, where the Circolo MandolinistI is
strongly in evidence. In the Royal Circolo
Mandolinistl Regina Margherita (the de
lightful leisureliness of the title!), besides
about twenty-six performers on the man
dolin, mandola (tenor mandolin) and mod
ern lute or mandoloncelloâ answering to
the violoncelloâ are to be found a pianist,
four guitarists, a kettledrummer and a
violoncellist, and the effect obtained is
said to be distinctly beautiful. On the
quartet of mandolins (first and second
mandolins, mandola and lute) it is no In
frequent tfilng to play the Beethoven and
Haydn string quartets, of which Mr.
Adelstein says enthusiastically that "one
can scarcely believe that such music may
be performed with such charming effect
on these instruments."
"Mandolin Memories" concerns itself
chiefly with the modern Instruments
of the plectrum family and is gen
erously illustrated with pictures of the
various instruments, from the Neapolitan
mandolin to the Japanese samisen. The
ancient lute, reminiscent of perfumed
Arabian gardens, large-eyed hourls and
love in Idleness, is also pictured, with the
Hawaiian ukelele, Chinese gekken and
Spanish Bandurrla. Portraits of famous
mandolinists are also given, and a few
characteristic groups of players.
Its haunts with a strenuous Industry
worthy of a better cause. Mr. Adelsteln's
monograph, however, rather persuades to
the belief that there is more in the mat
ter than meets the earâ than has so far
met mine at any rate â and that possibly
there is something approaching genuine
music to be obtained from the mandolin
and its kind.
7 Now it- happens, that Mrs." Dane is'in
deed FeJIcia Hindmarsh; that th^ere is a
child, and' that ; her cousin, Lucy Allen,
in Canada, had given her shelter and op
portunity, for. a. new start. -After a long
season of repentance ;deep and sincere;
at the death of her cousin for immediate
incitement, Felicia. comes to England, de
termined ; to live out her unhappy life
among her own people. But the unex
pected happens and she falls In love
with Lionel, the adopted son, of Sir Dan
iel Carteret,. a famous light ]of the law.
Almost : simultaneously Â¦ with Â¦ the discov
ery of her , love for. him and his for her
comes the shock. of Mrs. Bulsom-Porter' s
arraignment _ of her ' reputation; and she
appeals, for protection . and justification
to Sir Daniel.' 'Meantime the Porter
virago has chartered a detective to go to
Vienna, ;,who : discovers the truth about
Mrs./ Dane, :* but: seeing -her pitiable
plight,' he denies her identity" with Felicia.'
But.Sir Daniel, in the attempt to obtain
evidencej^f torn 1 * Mrs. e Dane Â¦ .herself -.- that
Without considering the possible effect
of the relation. Rising tells his aunt that
Felicia Hindmarsh was. a' governess In
the Trend family; thÂ£#t Mrs. Trend was
an invalid; that Trend, clever, handsome
and unscrupulous, had made lovÂ« to the
governess; that Felicia Hindmarsh, very
young, ignorant and sus'ceptible, had re
sponded to his overtures;-, that Mrs.
Trend, discovering this, killed herself,
and Trend, who had really loved her,
went mad and was g now in an . insane
asylum in the north of England. After
ward," realizing what he has done, Ris
ing swears that Mrs. Dane is not at all
like Felicia and protests without avail
his full belief In her own account of her
self; that she is the widow of a Mon
treal doctor, and without relatives
since - the ' death of her cousin% Lucy
Allen. But . the fat's In the fire, and
Mrs. Bulsom-Porter spends her days and
nights in Industriously spreading the
story in her own and Mrs. Dane's exclu
sive circle.
"Ah!" says Mrs. Bulsom-Porter.
Briefly the story of the play runs thus:
Mrs. Dane, a charming" and beautiful
young widow, with an apparently Im
peccable reputation and quite unmis
takable bank book, suddenly dawns upon
'the little town of Sunningwater, some
where in the south of England. She is
received in the best and dullest society
of the village and by her beauty and
charm succeeds In rousing the enmity of
the Mrs. ' Grundy of Sunningwater, here
incarnate In the person of Mrs. Bulsom-
Porter. Mrs. Bulsom-Porter ' has a hus
band. She is old, unbeautiful and various
ly repulsive and afflicted with a conse
quent gratuitous jealousy of her husband;
a genial sort of chap who good-naturenly
gives her her head In all her rolfies. This
pleasant leader of Sunningwater society
becomes jealous of Mrs. Dane, to whom
Mr. Bulsom-Porter has daringly ventured
to pay the usual respects of the sex to
a pretty and charming woman, and swears
furiously to him that the newcomer has
a past written all over her. Her husband
turns sulky and she swears to be r-r-re
venged. Her nepTiew, one Rising, 1 him
self somewhat epris in the same quar r
ter. unconsciously plays into the irate
lady's hands by telling her that Mrs. Dano
reminds him of one Felicia Hindmarsh,
whom he had met In Vienna and who
was the heroine of a strange and dreadful
adventure.
Naturally "Mrs. Dane's Defence" has
aroused q. variety of comment, much fa
vorable and unfavorable criticism from
the Tweedledums and Tweedledees of
morality as we are so far acquainted with
the science, together with a large ad
miration for its artistic worth. As a
piece of craftsmanship the play Is said
to be among Mr. Jones' best efforts and
it has already achieved a record of. an
entire season's run in -New York after the
same experience at Charles Wyndham's
Theater in London. â¢

Clay M. Greene's Enssion play.
Ed Sothern wounded his foot with a
% sword in the middle of a successful run
last season, and was thereby laid up with
a very sore toe. Frohman, naturally con
cerned for the (ate of his season, Inter
viewed Scthern's doctor aa to his chances
of recovery. Said the medico:

if he will consent to have the toe am
putated he can-ise about again In three

"Charles," solemnly replied Sothern,
"this is my toe, and I don't propose to
have it cut oft if I have to stay In bed
for six month's with it, play or no play,
sir," and Sothern still counts ten toes,
though Frohman's vicarious enthusiasm
for art remains unchanged.

Mr. Stelndorff, the man at the helm, is

has proven himself a capable, efficient

Signor Russo Is of those who show a
marked improvement in their work since
last year. The clever singer, while losing
none* of the spirit and ease always asso
ciated with his work, has broadened, mel
lowed and gained considerably intirtlstry.
His voice, too, is fuller, but his control is
greater ,*and he no longer holds on to the
high note for the mere fun of seeing how
long he can, though there Is plenty he
still does for the mere fun of it, witness
his performance of the Duke of Mantua on
Tuesday evening. x But with all his faults
we love him still , and, besides, he fully
made up on Thursday for his Tuesday
ei'enir.g monkeying ' with his Highness of
Mantua. Then Â¦there's Ferrari, who, bar
ring his tremolo (which he left behind the
scenes a time or two in "Rigoletto"), has
a really 6plendid barytone and can render
more than one part very cleverly. His
Rigoletto Is perhaps the best of his big
roles, but his Barber comes a close second.
Castellano's voice is not so pleasing. It
Is bard, though brightâ probably placed
too far forwardâ but he Is earnest and in
telligent in his work. Nlcollnl's smooth,
eweet basso is a useful voice, and his
brigand, Sparafuclle, is decidedly good
work. This week he will sing the chap
lain's part in "Lucia," one of his best
efforts. *

Oh. Collamarinl, pretty Collamarinl,
how could you get bo fat Tin one short
year? There are ways, you, know, and we
are distinctly averse to having our pretty
Carmen spoiled in the drawing? What a
voice it is! Of .all singers in the company
Collamarini is the most lavishly gifted by
nature, and by sheer force of tempera
ment almost persuades one Into, accept
ing all she does. But she is not a tithe
of what she might be with her gifts.
She does not breathe "* properly and
sometimes forces that beautiful voice
of hers until one trembles for its fu
ture; yet the next 'moment sings in so
wonderful fashion that one forgives
everything. Barbareschi Is a charming
singer, a charming woman. She has a
strong, artistic Instinct and gave us a de
lightful AJda this week. Her voice is
pure, sweet and sympathetic as we found
It last year, and she is a very welcome
member of the company. Repetto, too,
Is In good voice, and the dainty little
singer trills and runs with the same
fluent sweetness that we have always as
sociated with her work. She is another
very pleasing personality and an Indis
pensable member of the company. Pole
tini is another clever artist we are glad
to welcome againâ one we are always sure
of and one whose j modest bearing wins
liking at once. - â¢
Salasfa is In splendid trim, more than
ever the fine artist, singer and actor as
we have known him: Even to his make
up he is the thorough artist, and his cos
tumes are always finely suitable and thor
oughly picturesque. His Aznonasro Is a
triumph simply as a picture, and who that
has seen it can forget his Iago? Another
picturesque personage Is Augusto Dado,
the new basso, who has an excellent stage
presence and dramatic instinct. He also
Is a conspicuously artistic singer, and will
get his opportunity to show fully what he
can do in the "Meflstofele" of Bolto, soon
to be given and one of the big features
of the season. His Ramphis is notably
good.
IT has been a great pleasure this week
to meet th<; Tlvoli singers once again
and to find the kind, clever artist folk
as eood and even better than our
year-old memories of them. They all
look so well, are singing so well and the
reason promises so good entertainment
at their hands. I am sure. too. they are
pleased to be with us, proud of the per
ponal liking that we have for them, and
that w? shall get nothing less than the
best they have while they are here.

An enemy, of Schley could not have devised' a plan more hurtful to him. Because of it he
is entitled to the sympathy of the people, since the most helpless man on earth is the one who
is a victim of fool friends and the favor of sensational journalism. When the case opens, and as
the trial proceeds, the facts brought out will be given the country, and will equip it for judg
ment as to the merits of the dispute. Until then.it is well to be content and leave the matter 'in
the hands of the court which Schley has wisely demanded.-
executive power.
Not only official decorum but public propriety demands that the question be formally
tried by the court appointed for that purpose, and its decision will be respected. The attempt
of yellow and sensational journalism to advertise itself by using Schley as a sandwich man
should be resented Td>- that officer and his friends. The scheme to flood the President with letters
in Schley's favor was the most injurious that could have been devised. The President would be
guilty of an extreme indelicacy if he interfered' in any way with the court that is try the cause.
Such interference. would vitiate a decision if in Schley's favor, and" to attempt it is a confession
that his cause has not sufficient merit to stand alone, but must depend upon the intervention of
The dispute which has topsy-turveyed the Navy Department is not between ring cham
pions, and Historian Maclay made a mistake in using the language suitable to the trainer of the
champion bantam weight. for a. fistic battle with another bantam, ambitious to spar himself into
the belt.
Young Schley came near reducing the affair to the- plane of a modern prize-fighter's jaw
ing match, in which the principals wear out each other ajid the public by blows on each other's
verbal solar plexus, until all interest, in the actual battle is abandoned. .
N' X) matter what one's sympathy may be, the people generally will approve the caution
by the War Department to. Captain Schley to clap a stopper on his jaw tackle. His
distinguished father, the rear admiral, has set the young captain an example which he
~ will follow with credit ,to himself. The elder Schley has been reticent as to his affairs
throughout the prolonged controversy over the sea fight at Santiago. The same may be said of
Rear Admiral Sampson. The country 1 was divided into rival camps upon the issue between them,
and their respective champions,wise and otherwise, were buttering parsnips with hard words
enough so that no^ndulgence in that pastime was required of the principals. For this, or for the
reason that each rear admiral is, aware that interminable talk will not settle anything, they have
both been commendably prudent, -and very economical of conversation about the issue between
them. Perhaps the result of the investigation will show that as the superior officer of the fleet
Sampson was'not to be ignored, though his tarry top lights were not powder-grimed whejti the
action was over, and that Schley, in a fighting place; dicl his duty, like a brave sailor.
TOO MUCH TALK.
Socrates was a teacher, and Aristotle, the tutor of Alexander and Ptolemy Soter, his half
brother, was so broad that he left a path as wide as all the universe, down which mail has passed
in a procession, carrying the lamp of learning, until its ranks have widened and v knowledge
fills air the space that spreads between the farthest stars. Nature was a terror to the theologian ;
and its plain ways were fearful mystery, until the teacher lifted the veil and taught mankind that
there is nothing supernatural, but all that is, in the heavens above and the earth below and inthe :
waters under the sea, is natural.
It is not saying too much to declare that all knowledge that is began with . that "looking
down" to childhood and youth, by the teacher, which Professor Russell so much deplores as the |
cause of narrowness and bigotry in the teacher. Froebel and Pestalozzi looked, down into the
nature of the young and acquired knowledge of how to impart knowledge. The great Teacher, j
hearing the predecessor of Professor,Russell chide the children and tell them to keep still or go
away, said /'Suffer little children to come unto^me and forbid them not, for of such is the king
dom of heaven." He was looking' down/ but itNvas into that which mirrors all that is and is
to be.
AVe are not inclined to entirely agree with Professor James Earl Russell, although he hails
from Columbia. There are those who think that the teacher works in a line that brings a broader
and more tolerant knowledge of human nature than any other.- If the proper study of mankind is
man, and if the injunction "man, know, thyself," is by authority, the teacher more than any other is
iri contact with the fountain of knowledge. The child is father to the man, and in tKe study of
the child, the guidance of its intellectual development and the formation of its character the
teacher is constantly studying the alphabet and the first book of human nature. It, must riot be
forgotten that in every step toward an education the teacher, be. he in the kindergarten or in a
university faculty, is all the time the same distance in advance of the pupil. The teacher has ac
quired knowledge to impart, and the pupil the- task of its : acquisition. A rollcall of the broadest
men in the history of the United States is answered most frequently by the names of teachers.
Noah Webster, Agassiz. Mann, Silliman, Andrew D. White," Draper, Eliot, Le Conte, Jordan,
Wheeler, Harper and Hadley occur at once as examples of the broadening effect of that profes
sion which Professor Russell denounces as the narrowest and most bigoted.

" Professor James Earl Russell of Columbia, whose specialty: is pedagogy, in his clos
irigy address to the school told the teachers, who were there to learn, that their profession is an
ensmalling, narrowing and shriveling sort of calling, the most narrow-minded and bigoted of all
vocations. He attributed this to their contact with children, and is said to have a plea for
a broader, wider, more expansive and spreading- sort of training, to remedy the narrowness and
bigotry of the profession. 'C-S. â¢ \

NEW YORK, Aug. 3.â Arrangements
were completed in this city this week for
the development on a vast*scale by Ameri

eleven hundred square miles of gold, sil
ver, copper and platinum bearing mineral
lands in the South Ural Mountains, Rus
sia. The tract Is on the railroad leading
from St. Petersburg to Irkutsk, near the
latter place, and has been reserved as
crown mineral lands by the Czar's Gov
ernment The parties appearing in the
transaction were Prof. George A. Tread
well, a metallurgist living at the Waldorf-
Astoria, and friends of Paul Annasaff,
one of the builders and at present an
associate manager of the' Trans-Siberian
Railway. The Czar himself has taken a
keen interest in the negotiations, as the
development of this Imperial mineral
tract is expected to have- an important
bearing on mining enterprises throughout
the Russian Empire.

Grand Jury and the -subsequent with

by his old political enemies, who intended
to make good use of the timber affair in
Washington this fall. His answer has
been filed and is very lengthy, but in-
V 6tead of being sensational it is simply a
r?weeping and emphatic denial, declaring
Fevery charge baseless and that no irregu-
Jiax purchases of lands were made to his
knowledge. He declared the plaintiff has
no cause of action and asks for a dis
missal of the case, with all costs of ac
tion. He gives dates of purchase from
R. M. Cobban, showing in all he paid

Beports From- Dealers.
The sales of realty In this city during
the month of July numbered 391, and the
total amount of money represented in the
transactions .was $2,601,359. The move
ment of the market Is indicated by the
geographical distribution of~ the trans
ferred properties. In the Mission there
were ninety-seven sales, representing
$252,100; in the Western Addition seventy
six sales, amounting to' $568,810. The Po
trero made 'an excellent showing, due to
the deal for the Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany. The sales numbered fifty-two and
the total was $587,525. South Beach had
two sales, in total $70,000;. South' San
Francisco seventeen sales, $53,500; outside
lands sixty-eight" sales, $56,830. In 50-varas
forty-four transfers took place, represent
ing $683,444, and in 100-varas thirty-two
sales, amounting to ?231,900. Three city
slip and water lots were sold for $97,250.
the work of last month,
Thomas Magee & Sons' Circular says:
~ The Teal estate business was exceedingly
dull in July. This was> due to summer
dullness first, but second and chiefly to the
(strikes here and at the East. Both have had
their effect. There has been nothinc here in
the way of a real estate boom; it therefore takes
little to check what little progressive head
way sales and prices had attained. Buyers are
easily led to hold back and await developments.
Next to business properties, new flats have
been selline best. Hieh rents are just now
being paid for them. These make a Very at
tractive surface showing to those who do not
know that the first rents paid for new flats
are larger than they ever are again. There is
a fair demand for lots worth $1000 to $2500 be
tween Vailejo. Union, Buchanan and Devisa
dero, and between Clay, Jackson, Central and
First avenues. Mission property remains dull
of sale and low In price. Lots out by the Pan
handle of the Park district are dull of sale.

â - The mantle of misfortune still clings to
the shoulders of Hodson. Oakland's luck
less twirier. When Mosklman temporarily
eaved the gamo in the ninth inning yes
terday at Recreation grounds by being
put in to bat and tied the score with a
long drive to deep center the Dudes
chances for a victory looked fair and rea
eonably sure. But then came Hodson,
yyYCti evil in his wake. He relieved John
son from slab work, and Frisco landed
three times for hard raps, scoring two
runs Oakland could do nothing In the
tenth turn, and for the first time this
. series Henry's men walked home with
Jieads up in the air.
The game seesawed from start to fin
ish. First it was Oakland, then it was
San Francisco; then Oakland again, and
in the ninth Frisco had the lead. But
before this inning was concluded the 6core
read four all. "With two men under the
gravestones. Babbitt sauntered to first on
four bad ones. According to the order
Johnson was next up. but Moskiman, who
is a good sticker, was substituted for the
noisy man. Mnskiman toed the scratch
and his double scored Babbitt.
It was Joy for Oakland, but short-lived
5oy at that. Then Hodson began his plate
evolutions. Papst hit him and Krug hit
Wm. the "Brewer" going to third. Then
Keilly hit him, and the bellboy knew two
rings were coming to the local team. This
made the score 6-4. and so It stood until

A good illustration of 'coursing "'luck

The talent unwisely and -- without
strong reason made the: Lady a 10

to the disgust of the wise ones. Later in
the stake Sisquoc, who was on the card
to course with Silver Cloud, was forced
to run a bye. Lady Clare was selected to
go against him and 'because of her ex
ercise with Tom Hurlick was naturally
placed on the short end. Five to 1 one was

One of the features of the day was the
course between Palo Alto, the old cam
paigner, and Sterl & Knowles' puppy,
Freeze Out. The youngster is^a Futurity
candidate and her past showings have
installed her a favorite for stake honors in
that event. As the pair left the slips 'the
older dog went to the . front "and scored
three points. 'Then Freeze Out Joining In
took possession and by clever work ran
up a total of six. It looked bad for Alto'
while the little one was on the game, for
at any timeÂ»had she killed it would have
given -her the flag. As it was the cham
pion got in for a couple of wrenches and
a turn and dispatched the game, gaining
the decision by a solitary /point." . . Â¦
Thirteen 6hort ends, Â«omÂ« at good
strong odds, made the rundown of the
open stake at Union Park yesterday quite
pleasurable sport from the 'pikers' point
of view. ,

SACRAMENTO, Aug. ; 3.â The closing
day of the races given by the Pacific
Coast Trotting Horse Breeders' Associa
tion was one long. to be remembered by
those who were present. Besides two well
contested races, which were only decided
at the wire, the remarkable performance
of the Diablo colt, Sir Albert S, in the 2:17
class pace proved conclusively that he is
the greatest green pacer ever foaled In
'Â¦California. V Against nine contestants,
each one 'having remarkable speed, get
ting the worst of the first send-off and go
ing around all- those in front of "him, he
won easily in 2:11%. Then in the next
heat, being carried to every quarter-post
by one or two of the others, he came in
under a pull in 2:13. One horse. El Diablo,
who had shown his ability to go in* 2:10 on
Wednesday, was considered so good that
the' bookmakers offered no odds upon him,
'while. 2 to 1 was offered on Albert S. In
the next heat the little fellow, ably driven
by J. Groom, had a battle to the half with
Freddy C in l:03, : to the three-quarter pole
with the "good thing," El Diablo, in 1:33,
and then jogged home' under a pull in the
remarkable time of 2:08%, never ! making
a skip or break, but going so easily that
many horsemen pronounced him the com
ing two-minute pacer of America, He was
Just beginning to get ready to go when the

NEWPORT, R. I.. Aug. S.-The Inde
pendence to-day sailed the greatest race
Â° âÂ« K r , Car f er - In a stlff southwester.
which raised a rather heavy sea. she was
beaten forty seconds over a triangular ~
course of thirty miles by the Columbia.
As she allowed the Columbia thirty-one
seconds over that distance she was de
feated one minute and eleven seconds cor
rected time. This is a better showing than
the Constitution has made against the
Columbia under similar conditions of
wind, sea and weather.
On the first leg of the triangle, which
was a beat to windward, the Columbia
gained more than three minutes. No of
ficial time was taken at either the first
or second marks, so these figures are only
approximately correct. The regatta com
mittee estimate that on the second leg of
the course, which was a broad reach with
the wind abaft the starboard beam, the
Independence gained one minute and fif
teen seconds on her opponent, while on
the last leg of the course, which was
sailed with the wind on the port beam,
she gained thirty-five seconds.
The- last leg was the most exciting. The
breeze was puffy and at times had great
weight in it. Being about abeam, the
yachts felt Its full strength. Sometimes
the lee rail of the Independence was com
pletely submerged and the water on deck
rushed off in a torrent over the taffrail.
Never before had she heeled to such a
pronounced extent In a public perform
ance. It was noticed that when thÂ©
squalls were the heaviest the Independ
ence steered very wild and that two men
at the wheel could not keep her steady on N
her course. The yawing about was so 1
pronounced that she would come up into
the wind until the luff of the jib topsail
quivered as though she were close hauled
and essaying a fisherman's luff. A minute
or two later she would be running wide
off her courss and covering an ample Â¦
stretch, of the ocean, leaving behind her
a serpentine wake. While* the Independ
ence was performing this zigzag work the
Columbia was going through the water
straight, attending strictly to business
and heading for Brentons Reef lightship.
So far as sails were concerned the Inde
pendence had the worst of it. She was
handicapped by a working gaff topsail,
which on the ten-mile stretch to wind
ward was more or less of, a backsail. and
which in the two reaches that followed
had very little pulling or propelling pow
er. Another sail that prevented her from
making a better record was the medium
sized Jib topsail, which was set after
passing the first mark. This sail con
tributed largely to her wild steering, and
when it was taken in she felt the benefit
of . its balance. Mr. Lawson, her , owner,
observed her behavior from his steam
yacht Dreamer.
With regard to the performance of the
Columbia, she was sailed admirably. The
only mishap that befell her was the foul-
Ing of the jib sheet when off Point Judith
on the windward leg. This necessitated
a short tack, so that it might be cleared,
but she lost little by it. While the Inde
pendence was encountering the series of
squalls en the homeward leg the Colum
bia by no means escaped them. The masts
of both buckled considerably, and the Co
lumbia heeled over at times as much as
the Boston boat. Also she steered on two
or three occasions almost as wildly as the
Independence, but she was got under con
trol and steadied on her course far more Â¦
quickly.
The thirty-mile course, ten miles of '
which were dead in the wind's eye. was
covered to two hours, fifty-one minutes
and forty-eight seconds by the) Columbia.
making it one of the fastest on record.

when he came out many wondered at his
fine appearance, and great praise must be
accorded Groom for. the splendid man
ner in which he brought him to the post.
El Diablo had apparently laid up the oth

was given. Sir Albert S had Freddin C as
a contender, and he carried him to the
half in 1:03. Then El Diablo set sail for

"Water Front Notes.
A new gasoline schooner for the Colo
rado River trade is ready to go into com
mission as soon as her machinery reaches
Guaymas from San Francisco. She is to
be propelled by a screw worked in. a tun
nel, and will in consequence be very light
draught. Her owners, TV. Ibarri & Sons
of Guaymas, intend running her between
Gulf of California points and Yuma.
For Colorado Eiver Trade.
Out - Twenty-Seven Days From;, San.
.. Francisco for Coquille River.
The schooner Confianza left here twen
ty-seven days ago for Coqullle River., and
her owners are wondering what, has be
coma of her. Three days ago, according
to advices, she had not reached her des
tination, and some people fear a. disaster.
Captain Jakobson is making his first voy
age in the Confianza, and it now begins to
look as though It would be his last. Coast
ing schooners generally leave here in bal
last and make good runs up the coast if
the captain is not afraid to "carry on."
Jakcbson evidently would not take any
chances, as ten days ago he was spoken
off port with the schooner under short
canvas. At first the owners feared for
thÂ» vessel, but when the - news came of
her still being off port they changed their
minds and are now blaming the captain.
The chances are that the Confianza will
get back here before the strike is over.
WHEEE IS THE CONFIANZA?
cÂ»-r|-5a HE disabled transport Lennox ar
1 rived yesterday morning In tow of
1 the coasting steamer Iaqua. The
It Government tug Slocum that was
6ent out to pick up the troop ship
and bring her into port is 6till outside,
having passed her In the fog that pre
vails along the coast.
When th* oil stsainer George Looinis

nox the transport was forty miles off
Plefirss Blancas. When the Iaqua picked
[ her up Bhe was eight miles from the point
tfand drifting rapidly inshore. In another
M three hours she would have had to anchor
f or else go ashore. There was no. bicker
[ ing ever the price of a tow, au Captain
' Gunderson of the steam schooner was
perfectly willing to leave the settlement
of the service to Lloyds. On that basis
the Iaqua will probably receive $15,000 or
$20,000 for her tow.
The Lennox left Manila thirty-seven and
Nagasaki twenty-nine days ago. When
off the Golden Gate her tail shaft broke
and in spite of what canvas that could be
6et she went steadily south with the cur
rent. Off Piedras Blancas a boat was
pent ashore to bring assistance, but after
that instead of drifting south the troop
ship drifted inshore. A dense fog set in
and the whistle was kept going morning,
noon and night, but never an answering
signal came back. Finally on Thursday
morning the Iaqua showed up under her
lee tow and Captain Williamson lost no
time In accepting a tow.
The Lennox brings from Manila seven
teen cabin passengers and forty-five in
thÂ« steerage, besides nine stowaways who
got aboard at NagasakL The cabin pas
sengers were Captain William Yates,

The captain and officers deny that the
steamship was short of provisions, and
Captain Williamson asserts that there is
still a month's supply for all hands
aboard. A. J. Murton, the sick man, is
in a precarious condition. The officers'
horses were not killed in order to supply
fresh meat with which to make broth, but
the chances are that he would have been
able to walk ashore had that course been
pursued. Murton was formerly a member
of the Montana Volunteers, but remained
in the Philippines to go into business.

From reports received by Superintend
ent of Schools Webster from principals
during the last week regarding the classi
fication of their schools it was ascertained
yesterday that in many of the schools
there are "not sufficient desks to accommo
date all the pupils attending. While the
aggregate number of pupils without seats
is not large and may not exceed 200, the
law requires that provision be made for
their comfort. The Board of Education
has expressed ; its intention to -.provide
necessary desks, and this will undoubtedly
be done. The lack of accommodations,
according to the principals' reports is
most noticeable In, the Bernal, Jefferson,
Park, Clement and Irving Scott schools

Ringllng Brothers' circus will open in
this city on Monday, August 26, and the
engagement will extend over a period of
seven days. The public undoubtedly has
a lively -recollection of the merits of this
great show and the enthusiasm it created
here last year. Although it was heralded
as a great- show, and one of imposing
magnitude, its 6ize and character was to
a great extent a surprise. The mere fact
that it was announced as a great show
was not convincing. Other shows of in
ferior Quality had been heralded in the
advance bills as "great."
Every circus that ever offered itself to
the attention of the show going people of
California has been, according to its ad
vance couriers, "the most stupendous ag
gregation on earth," and when the claim
was made for Ringling Brothers' circus
last year the wise ones simply smiled. The
discovery, Â¦ therefore, that the show was
not only a great institution but one of
the greatest that had ever been seen in
this section of the country, was therefore
in the nature of a pleasant surprise.
This year the show returns with a long
roster of new attractions and. with all its
departments enlarged. A bigger and bet
ter show than even that of last season
is promised.

tary of the Pacific Coast Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, to ob
tain possession of the two Chinese girls,
Chan Ah Ying and Sow Yung, from Mrs.
Margaret L. Lake of the Chinese Metho
dist Mission, were filed In Judge Cook's
court yesterday morning. Mrs. Lake was
present in court.
Attorney Lennon. on behalf of Secretary
Kane, asked for time to prepare an an
swer to the return, and the Judge con
tinued the matter till Wednesday.
Kane claims that he is perfectly Justi
fied in the position he has taken. The
girls were rescued by him and he was ap
pointed their guardian. He placed them
In the Methodist Mission, as it was the
only course open to him at the time. Now
he has procured a home for one with a
reputable Chinese merchant and for the
other with Mrs. Sitton, 4 Clay avenue,
who is a teacher in the Chinese public
Echool. In that way he says the girls
will be free from the contaminating in
fluences of reclaimed Chinese fallen
women and will be better oft in every re
spect- He says he is simply following the
Fame practice as in the cases of white
children.

It can be " said, however, in an Impersonal
way. that during-, these long years many
changes have taken place in San . Francisco.
This community is ; blessed with a large num
ber of men and women whose personal efforts
to foster the cause of religion and humane
interests have succeeded beyond the imagina
tion of their elders. They have ou^rrown the
limitations of former times, when communal
wants were few, yet when those deep,-, broad
foundations were laid, upon which It Is com
paratively easy Â¦ to build - superstructures - of
generous dimensions. Our community's great
advantage has been that the pioneers under
stood their business and that therefore they
have left us rich legacies In more than one
sense of -the word. "We have received from
them, as our religious and humane allotment,
institutions nursed by them- with the ., tenderest
care, founded by them with sagacity and com
petent foresight. Still, the business of the
second generation was an exceedingly delicate
one. To maintain is often more difficult than
to create. This signal blesslnsr has come to
us that the fine spirit of the elders passed Into
many of the children, bo that with the multi
plication of the numbers of the community
and the consequent springing up of new wants
there appeared no ' lack whatever of either
men or means to carry on the old and the new
work, to bear the greater burdens and to de
velop new interests with the fine enthusiasm
of the pioneer days. And this has. been the
greatest blessing and solace of the writer,
that during all the years of his ministrations
there has been no lack of leaders, no dearth
of the elect who do God's work, and hence the
noble harvest of Emanu-El is their glory and
.reward.* May God permit them to enjoy both
In full measure. â¢-
The record of this low? service 1b a part of
the history of the Temple Emanu-El and may
some day, in the .near "or distant future,, as
God wills, find its chronicler. No man Is a
competent Judge ! of his own service. What
appears -most worthy of notice to- him- may
be deemed unimportant and inessential to" oth
ers. . No man's history is completed until he
dies, and every day's service Is Important to
form- a Judgment of" the .whole. - Hence it
would be an assumption smacking- of self-con
ceit if the writer. were to venture an account
of the work done during' these- long years of
service, in the course of which a young man
travels ' toward life's meridian' arid " the glow
and ardor of youth are dampened by the ccoler
atmospheres of middle age. ' ' Still, * It.' is j not
amiss for any man who . renders proud Â¦ and
willing service to look .back with satisfaction
upon the ; years' of his labors to recall with
emotions of gratitude the fine men and women
he has known, to be devoutly conscious of the
blessing of being permitted to serve a' com
munity nobly alive to its religious and ! hu
mane responsibilities and to express a hope
that future years, bringing greater knowledge
and experience, v may crown the toil of the past
with the blessing of a plenteous harvest. . So
much any man may do for himself without
being misunderstood, except by those who
make it their' business to misunderstand and
misinterpret him. But of ' the latter the
writer, happily, has had occasion to take very
little notice.
Â¦. Dr. Voorsanger was elected junior rab
bi of the congregation June 14, 18S6, and
preached his inaugural sermon on August
1 -of that year. .Until March, 1889, he
served conjointly with Rabbi Elkan Cohn;
who on March 11 of that year was gath
ered \ to his fathers ; and in April of the
succeeding year he was re-elected rabbi
of the congregation for a term of five
years,' having since that time been twice
re-elected for similar terms, his present
contract expiring August 1, 1905.
: - In an article written ' by the pastor,
which appears in the Temple Emanu-El,
he discusses his long service and takes
occasion to dwell on the kindness he has
enjoyed while, serving his . congregation.
In part he says: ..
' Rev. Jacob Voorsanger, pastor -of. the
Temple Emanu-El, -." preached a Berxnon
yesterday . commemorative of the conclu

Rabbi of the congregation. His Sabbath
subject was taken . from Joshua and en
titled "For and Against." Dr. Voorsanger
spoke | eloquently and interestingly. The
sermon was' purely a theological one and
in concluding he modestly dwelt on the
fact that. the day marked the anniversary
of fifteen years' labor among the people
he has learned to love and esteem. At
the close of services the pastor was con
gratulated by many of the congregation.

Is being erected by St. Mark's parish, will
form a new style of church architecture
on the other side of the bay. There
only a few buildings like it
mony will be In accordance with the usual
Episcopal form and will be marked by
dignified simplicity.
This style of construction has ' many
strong advocates, who urge it as the com
ing way of erecting buildings. A house
on the coast. ' The church has been
designed according to the Spanish
renaissance, the same style of architec
ture which was used at the Pan-American
Exposition. The design resembles closely
the old mission style. On a foundation
of solid concrete a substantial wooden
framework will be erected. The frame
will be covered with perforated sheets of
expanded steel and over the steel will be
placed a coat of cement. "When the steel
Is entirely coated the outside of the
church will resemble a cement pavement.
The roofs will be of metal Spanish tiles,
but the domes will be of cement. The en
tire building will be painted.
thus built, it Is claimed, is more. durable
than brick or stone.
The church, following Episcopal tradi
tions, .â¢.will. ,be cruciform. Â¦ Three- aisles,
symbolics t-of.the- Trinity; will -lead-to the'
chancel. At the beginning of the three
aisles .will be the baptismal font.
One of the principal features of the
building will be the main tower at the
corner of Ellsworth street and Bancroft
way. There .will be the principal en
trance. Under a subsidiary tower on Ells
worth street will be another entrance. In
the open belfry of the main tower the
congregation hopes to place chimes. Upon
the Bancroft-way side will be a cloister
the length of the nave. Between the two
towers-and exactly opposite the altar will
be the baptistry. It will form a distinct
feature and will be one step above the
main floor. It will be lighted by five win
dows to be erected to the memory of de
parted infants.
Another feature will be the rounded
apsidal chancel. There will be no east
window, so common In most churches, but
the chancel will be illuminated by^a belt
of skylights, hidden from the view of the
audience. The lighting will be good, as
neither at night, nor day will there be n
glare in' the eyes of the. congregation. All
electric lights will be hidden.
Back of the altar a semi-circular ambu
latory will connect the robing room on the
north with the rector's study and vestry
on the south. The chancel will accommo
date a large choir.
The building is 84x132^ feet, exclusive
of steps. With the steps it practically
covers a 100x150 foot lot. The church will
seat 800 people. When completed it will
cost $15,000. Â¦-. .
The plans were drawn by William Cur
lett of San Francisco, who adapted a de
sign by Joseph Neill of Pittsburg, Pa.
De "Ware & Quinn of San Francisco are
the contractors.
The church will be ready for occupancy
by Christmas.
Speeches were delivered by Mr. McCar
thy. Mr. Flynn. Mr. Harrington" and W.
M. Miller. Messrs. Flynn and Harrington
pledged themselves to look after * the in
terests /of : the workingmen. .Mr. Miller
represented the' Primary League. In his
speech he said that if St. Peter was to
come down from- heaven -and, be'nomi
nated for an office in a convention con
trolled by Kelly and Crimmins he would
be defeated. He said this was another
Estee year, and It behooved. the party to
put up the best ticket. If, the bo3ses were
mixed up in the election, â¢ no matter how
good the nominee might b*; he would be
defeated. He said 'Â¦ the Primary League
would have men at the polls who would
see that all the votes were properly
counted. 'â¢ â¢'â¢Â¦Â¦' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦',

That the Republicans of the Thirty
second District do not intend to allow
the bosses to control their delegation in
the coming convention was evidenced at
the. meeting cf the Primary League Dis
trict Club last evening. The session was
held" at 444 Brannan street and a truly
representative gathering was present.
The club is made up of workingmen. who
are tired of boss rule and who are anxious
to have their, representatives nominate
men who If. elected will give a hearing to
the laboring class and If they promise the
workingmen certain reforms will not vio
late their pledges. , ;. ' ..
The meeting was a lively one. Some
excellent speeches were delivered. The
language at times, was not elegant, but
it was forcible enough to win the plaudits
of the auditors. " â¢
William Harrington, president of the
Thirty-second District Club, left a sick
bed to" attend the meeting. He was as
sisted-during the deliberations by T. C.
Duff, a very popular citizen of the dis
trict. Z. T. Cason was the first speaker
introduced. He dwelt at' length on tha
advisability - of- having harmony in the
party and he appealed to the members to
vote for men who" were upright and would
be true to party principles. '
One of- the. best speeches of the evening
was, delivered by Mr. Duff. It was an
address that was appreciated by 'the
laboring men. Mr. Duff submitted the
names of William Harrington, John Ken
ny and John T. Flynn. as the club's del
egates to :the coming. convention." On rno
tion of Mr. King the trio were nominated
unanimously. Â¦
Thirty-Second District.
Yesterday there were 600 new registra
tions and 1200 changes of residence. I Offi
cers of the Republican Primary League
are elated over the big registration. It
is regarded as a sure harbinger of vic
tory.
The league, having accomplished its pur
pose in getting citizens to register, will
now exert its power to get citizens to
vote at the primary. Candidates do not
count in the league's calculations. A con
vention composed of . representative citi
zens â a straight-out, inflexible, uncom
promising anti-boss conventionâ is de
manded by the Republican Primary
League. If citizens elect the delegate
tickets indorsed by the league a conven
tion of that character will be won. A
candidate for office who will not subor
dinate his own claims to the general wel
fare of the community is simply a selfish
seeker of office and is not entitled to pub
lic support. Â¦ Â¦
Registration for the primary election
closed at 11:30 o'clock last night. The
number of registered voters exceeds
78,000. the largest list ever recorded in
San Francisco.
Anti-Boss Convention Demanded.
The old-time bosses, Kelly and Crlm
mins, waiting for a turn- in events, saw
with increasing apprehension the grow
ing power and influence of the Republican
Primary League in municipal affairs. The
bosses seized the opportunity to join
forces with the disgruntled Grand Hotel
ers. When the fusion was secretly ef
fected the bosses began to cry out .that
It was time for the Republican State Cen
tral Committee to interfere and indorse
Boss Kelly's County Committee as the
regular party organization!
The State committee, which at best is
only a ragged-edged boss aggregation,
quickly responded and executed the pro
gramme handed down by Kelly, Gage,
Crlmmins. Herrin, Lynch and Parker.
The whole story of the shameful indorse
ment was told the day after the commit
tee met. Cheap.politicians from Los An
geles and Santa Rosa presented a pro
gramme, which j the boss push In San
Francisco swallowed at a gulp.
The. foolish Intrusion of the State body
In local affairs had a result just the op
posite of what the bosses counted on. Cit
izens of San Francisco, respecting the
honored princiyle of self-government and
applauding the noble sentiments of home
rule, gave renewed support to the Repub
lican Primary League. The State interfer
ence really intensified the demoralization
of the allied bdfcses. To break the grow
ing Â¦ prestige of the league the bosses
pawned the patronage of : the State ad
ministration over and over again. : The
wary politicians knew that every place in
the gift of tho, State administration was
plastered with % ten promises, hence the
boss overtures were regarded as gold
brick' offerings. '
The Primary League is still growing In
public confidence and support. It prom
ises to win oul in tho election of dele
gates to the municipal nominating con
vention. Signs of a popular uprising in
the cause of anti-boss, municipal govern
ment are noted in several districts. The
enthusiasm of the campaign is extending
to all the districts. A big vote at the
primary election August 13 will, seal the
doom of the allied bosses.
Allied Bosses Alarmed.
. The Republican Primary League was
organized for the purpose of awakening
in the minds of the people a full sense
of the importance of the approaching
elections. Impressed with the idea that
the bosses and others of the predatory
classes ' could not succeed if . the forces
of good citizenship were rallied at the
primaries, the founders of the league es
tablished cIuds in every district of- the
city and used all the means available to
get. the names of voters on the register.
When the first steps were taken to or
ganize the league prominent merchants,
taxpayers, worKingmen, professional men
and representative citizens generally were
consulted. It was submitted, at the out
set that honest administration of munici
pal affairs under the auspices of the Re
publican party was the main object In
view. Leading citizens of the party gave
unqualified, indorsement of the enter
prise. For a time the only opposition the
league encountered came from candidates
who had figured on capturing the munici
pal convention. Chief opponents In this
regard were the legatees of the defunct
Grand Hotel party. They had in view
the offices of Sheriff and District Attor
ney. They calculated that the people
would pay so little attention to the pri
mary election that delegates favoring
their candidates would be elected with
out .opposition. When they saw unmis
takable signs of a large vote they took
alarm and opened war on the promoters
of the league. Â¦ â¢ Â¦'
dered the cause of good municipal
government superior -service. The list of
registered voters Is remarkably large and
the credit for the increase is due largely
to the orderly work of the league.
THE Republican Primary League
deserves special credit for its ex
cellent work In agitating the ques
tion of registration. It has ren-
To the Honorable the Board of Election Com
missionersâGentlemen: In looking over thÂ«
list of delegates put forward by a Democratic

will notice that quite a number of those gen

cers. We are under the Impression that the
election laws do not permit of this; at any
rate you will readily perceive of the Injustice
of permitting them to serve. They will have
the advantage of soliciting votes inside the
polling places, to say nothing- of the advantage
sained In counting their own votes. Should
disputes arise, it is but natural to presume that
they will not construe the doubt against them
selves. In the Interest of decency and. Justice

J. K. Jones, president of the club, acted
as chairman, and in a few well chosen
words opened the affair, telling his audi
tors of the object for which the club had
been formed and exhorting them- to usÂ«
their most strenuous efforts to further
this object, and to do their duty as citi
zens and honest men In attempting to
wipe the stain of corrupt government
from our city and give to San. Franei3co
upright, .reliable and clean business men
to act as the directors of her destiny. Mr.
Jones was followed by A. P. Van. Duser.
D. W. Buchard and N. T. Coon, all of
whom spoke along the same lines, urging
their hearers to stand firmly together,
particularly that now they were Â¦ prac
tically assured of an ultimate victory.
Though these speeches were interspersed
with songs, musical selections, stories and
jokes; though no pressure -was brought to
bear on any one in the audience to join
the organization; though no influence was
used in any way whatever, in fact, and
although the meeting, as has been stated,
was more of a social affair than anything:
else, yet at its conclusion so many: came
forward and voluntarily asked to be al
lowed to sign the rolls that the club's
roster can now show nearly five hundred
names. All of these names belong to
reputable business men, many of them are
representative of the younger element,
which has not been long enoueh in public
life to experience its corrupting influences,
and not a few are those who in former
years followed the standard of bosslsm
and now. at the eleventh hour, come seek
ing forgiveness. " â¢
Last night the Thirty-seventh District
Primary Club held an informal smoker.
The purposes of the meeting could hardly
be considered political in the real mean
ing of the word. The primary object of
the gathering was to have/' a good time,
and to bring the different members of thÂ«
new organization into closer social re
lationship with each other. There were
cigars and tobacco in abundance and a
band and the Columbia Quartet supplied
the musical end of the programme.
Nowhere in the city is the good work
bringing about better and more thorough
ly satisfactory results than in the Thirty
seventh District. Through the efforts of
J.-K. Jones and other district leaders an
immense amount of enthusiasm has been
aroused, and if the feeling in that pajrt
of the city is a criterion ! of the general
sentiment through the entire municipality,
and there Is every reason to believe it is,
the 13th of August will go down in the
history of. San Francisco as the day
upon which it Is eminently ' right and
proper for the few survivors of the old
"push" to decorate the graves of the.
bosses.

This is the particular statement in the
Interview that is causing the greatest
amount of comment, as the objection
does appear in full on the record, which
slums that the second panel of jurors
Â¦was regularly brought into court and the
objection was made at the trial before
Judge Shaw, and not for the first time
before the Supreme Court when the case
went before that body on appeal.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 3.â Judge Shaw
was seen , to-night and Informed that
members of the Supreme Court were of
the opinion that he was in error or had
been misquoted in regard to his order in
the Compton case. The Judge was told
the contention concerning the second
panel. All he would say was:
"I refuse to be drawn into any contro
versy in this case. I did not make the
order for the purpose of a controversy
with the Supreme Court. I have said all
I intend to on this case and my order as
published speaks for Itself." .
The decision In substance is that the second
panel of jurors, called from another depart
ment to complete the Jury, was not regularly
brought into court. This objection was not
made upon the trial and does not appear in the
record. If made at all it was made upon the
argument in the Supreme Court It is well
settled that such an objection cannot be made
for the first time In that court.

ton, who was arrested four years ago
for forgery and whose case has just been

among the legal fraternity of this city.
The general Impression is that there must
have been some mistake made in quoting
the Los Angeles Judge, as it is not be
lieved that a jurist could possibly be so
ignorant of the record of a case tried in
his own court as the remarks of Judge
Shaw, if that gentleman is correctly

Detective McMahon said last night that
he did not believe a single word of the
girl's tale as to the robbery.
Last evening the girl was asked to give
an explanation of the various "fairy
tales" she had given out concerning her
self, but she impudently replied "That's
none of your business." The police will
continue to investigate the alleged rob
bery and until the work is finished Cap
tain Seymour says he is not prepared to
brand the story of Pauline de Vore as a
fabrication. ' â¢"
Detective McMahon -closely questioned
the occupants of the flats adjoining the
one occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Davis. Not
a single person could be found who heard
the slightest noise in the Davis flat on
Friday evening during the time the ser
vant girl says the burglar was in the
place. The neighbors informed the detec
tive that they did not believe the story of
Pauline de Vore as to the robbery. Mc-
Mahon learned that Fonner left the city
two weeks ago and that ' he is supposed
to be on his way to Cape Nome.
Neighbors Heard No Sounds.
When the girl called for help on Friday
night and the neighbors rushed into the
Davis fiat, they found that gas jets were
lighted enly in the hallway, Mrs. Davis'
bedroom and in the room occupied by the
servant girl. Yet the burglar is supposed
to have ransacked a trunk in an unlighted
bedroom and also a writing desk in the
unlighted parlor. The light from the hall
way would have shown a burglar the sil
verware exposed on the table in the din
ing-room, yet that valuable property .was
not molested.
Detective McMahon learned that a quan
tity of silverware was lying exposed on
the dining-room table, of the Davis flat
on Friday night when the girl says the
burglar ransacked the premises. This is
regarded as a significant fact. The silver
ware exposed on the dining table was not
touched, but silverware hidden in a trunk
in a bedroom was taken. The servant girl
also claims that while she was uncon
scious the burglar found her pocketbook
and abstracted $7 80 from it, the pocket
book being in her bedroom.

of property for her. I gave her some good
advice this morning and sent her- about
her business."
Detective McMahon made a careful
search of the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Davis yesterday. He found a bottle of
cholorform in the room of the Eervant
girl and she admitted the ownership of
the deadly fluid. She told Detective Mc-
Mahon that she used it for rubbing her
shoulder, but a few hours later contra
dicted herself and' said she secured it for
cleaning feathers. The fact that the girl
also had a Distol in her possession when
she first entered the emoloy of the Davis
family is looked upon with suspicion by
the officers.
SHAW DESIRES
NO CONTROVERSY
Barly yesterday morning the girl called
en Detective Lucas and asked him "what
he thought of the write-ups she had re
reived in the papers." She admitted to
Lucas that she had told the story of .the
""uncle and the wealth he had secured
from her" as her excuse for being in San
Francisco. Lucas says Fonner admitted
to him that hi? had met the servant girl
in Colorado, where she was employed in a
hotel. Fonner also to;d Lucas that the
pirl Â¦was not an orphan and that s^he be
longed to a good family in Ohio. When
he returned to this city the girl followed
him here and asked him to marry her,
though he had a wife living.
"I don't place any faith in the girl's
Etory," said Lucas. "Fonner told me that
lie did not want anything to do with her,
and that he had given orders at his room
ing-house that she was not to be allowed
near his room. I think her yarn about the
burglary is on a par with the one that I
was paid $800 by her to locate her missing
Proud of Her Effort.
The De Vore rirl yesterday admitted to
Captain Seymour that the tale of the
missing "uncle' and the embezzled for
tune was pure fiction. She also admitted
that she knew "Dr." Fonner and had been
very friendly with him in Denver and had
followed him to this city. She said he
had left for the north after borrowing $10
from her.
Private Detective Lucas yesterday re
iterated his denial of the girl's statement
that Ehe had paid him $S00 for locating
her "uncle" and recovering- 140,000 that
had been stolen from her. What he did
do Â¦was to locate for her a man known as
"Dr." W. H. Fonner, who was formerly
connected with a specialist in this city,
for which service she paid him S3.
Detective McMahon was detailed on tha
case by Captarn of Detectives Seymour,
who himself auestioned the servant girl.
She clung to her that in answer to
a ring at the doorbell she had admitted a
presumed messenger, who threatened her
Â¦with a big pistol and ransacked the flat,
while she was in a convenient state of un
consciousness. One of the chief reasons
for not crediting the servant's statement
as to the alleged robbery was the fact
that she was proved to have deliberately
falsified in her statements as to her pre
vious career.

Monday and expects to have his vessel
ready for sea at the appointed time.
The collier Bristol is still in the stream,
awaiting an opportunity to- discharge her
cargo of coal. There are now thirty-three
vessels tied up on account of the strike.
The ships that were added to the list of
idle vessels yesterday were the French
bark McMahon, from Cardiff â¢ with 3300
tons of coal aboard; the schooners Mel
ancthom and Del Norte, and the steamer
Celia. The three last named vessels are
lumber-laiSen.
Beadle & Co., owners of the steamer
Point Arena, are making every effort to
get their vessel ready for sea- by to-mor

teen years ago, and in all that time has
never missed a regular trip. " It. is probable
that she will succeed In getting out, but
will be, several .hours late.
The Pomona; which arrived yesterday

loss to find. men to handle the. rrelgnt. He
appealed to the Chamber of Commerce,
and that body appealed to the people of
the city for aid. They responded to the
call and in a short time a gang of ama
teur long-shoremen was at work -hustling
merchandise. The 'unloading of the Po
mona was completed in such quick time
that, she was able to leave on her return
trio on. time, [n

NON-UNION BARBER, DEFENDING HIS SHOP AGAINST MOB,
SHOOTS INTO CLAMORING CROWD AND WOUNDS PASSER BY
THE strike situation on the water
front was not materially changed
yesterday. The inactivity of the
last few days was still apparent,
and there was nothing to indicate
that the conflict is any nearer an end.
All the ship owners and steamship com
panies having vessels at the docks are
making every effort to procure help in
order that they can send their vessels out,
but the fleet of tied-up vessels on the Mis
sion Flats grows larger every day and the
piles of freight on the wharves are grow
ing with each hour. Â¦
The officials of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company are making herculean ef
forts to rid themselves of the cargoes that
have been .'landed on their dock. Every
town around the .bay is being canvassed
for men, but' it has proved difficult to se-
cure the large number they need.
Forty negroes : were secured in the
neighborhood of | Stockton yesterday and
landed at the Mail dock by the bay steam
ers. They were put to work immediately
with the Chinese, 1 Japanese and the few
white men employed on the wharf. With
this addition to their forces the Mail -
Company was able to handle considerable
merchandise, but the number of . men at
work is still far short of the number re
quired to make any appreciable headway.
The mixed lot of stevedores is handling
the cargo of the America Maru. The City
of Sydney,- which is still fully loaded, is
tied up at the small wharf between the
'Mail, dock and the Fremont-street dock.
She will have to remain there until the
longshoremen finish ,. dsicharging the
cargo of the other vessel, which will re
quire some days.
The Colon has""been brought in from the
stream and moored to the west side of the
Mail dock. She will be used as a board
ing house for the men, as it is feared that
if the strikers get an opportunity to talk
to them they will leave. Â¦
Considerable difficulty is being experi
enced by the North American Commercial
Company in securing a crew for the ConÂ«
maugh, the , loading of .which was com
pleted yesterday. The strike has caused
a delay of five days in her departure, and
it is probable that another day will elapse
before she succeeds in making a start for
Alaska. A crew was secured for the ves
sel, but owing to the vigilance of the
striking sailors. the owners were unable
to get them aboard- the ship. The men
were gathered together -yesterday morn
ing and sent to a lodging house'on.Bran
nan street and told to await the arrival
of the police escort which was to protect
them on the way-, to the ship . -
When the police arrived at the house
they found that a numbec of union pick
ets had succeeded in convincing the non
union men that they would not like the
trip to Alaska and they refused to go
with the police officers to the Conemaugh.
Their actions compelled. the vessel's own
ers to send her. to the Mission Flats,
where she will remain until a crew is se
cured. A part of the Filipino crew of the
transport Pennsylvania was secured for
the Conemaugh, but as there was some
question as to the legality of the action
the Orientals returned to their vessel.
The George W. Elder arrived frcm Port

On the water front the "riot call" was

The whistle that caused so much con
sternation had been out of order and was
being tested after having been repaired.
The "fire-out" signal was given in order
not to confuse firemen or to mislead the
public. The unusual repetition caused the
excitement.
Experiments with the whistle, at . the
power house of the San Francisco and
San Mateo electric road at Bryant and
Eleventh streets yesterday afternoon
caused great excitement in various parts
of the city, as the unwonted whistling
was mistaken for a riot call- and many
feared that a serious conflict between
strikers and the police had begun. .. ,, . .
The whistle blew "10-1," the "fire-out"
signal, and repeated it three times, and
then, after an interval, twice more. At
the baseball game the crowd in the grand
stand became greatly excited and a hun
dred or more left the park and started for
the water front. About that time a fire
alarm was rung in from box 73 at Sev
enth and Howard streets, and the crowd,
supposing that the signal Indicated thÂ©
location of the riot, hurried along the
streets In that direction.

WHISTLE CAUSES ALARM.
The executive committee of the Labor
Council .was present at the meeting and
advised the boxmakers to remain true to
their rights as unionists and not to re
turn to> work.
At a meeting of. the Boxmakers" Union
last night in B'nal B'rlth Hall It was defi
nitely determined. that the members of the
union' who were recently locked out by
their employers should not return to^jvork
under the proposed agreement, which,
they assert, does not accord to them the
right of supporting the principles of their
union. This action was taken in reference
to a circular' which the managers of the
box .. factories have been, distributing
among their .former employes. - .
The circular is in the nature of a con
tract, which must be subscribed to by the
men before they will be allowed to return
to work.' It binds them not to join in
sympathetic strikes, not to boycott and
not to intimidate their fellow workmen to
become members of a union.
Former Positions.
Box Makers Will Not Return to Their
REJECT EMPLOYERS' CONTRACT
A meeting of the union will be held at
117 Turk street at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
Steps will be taken to reorganize the
picket forces.
It was reported at headquarters that
ten men who had been sent from Napa to
work in the American can factory during
the strike had quit their work yesterday
and returned to their homes. When this
report was substantiated there was great
rejoicing among the strikers.
The headquarters of the Porters', Pack
ers* and Warehousemen's Union was
thronged with strikers all of yesterday.
The men expressed themselves as being
satisfied with the situation. They are
hopeful that the employers will ultimately
yield recognition to the unions.
"We are fighting for a principle," said
President O'Neill of the union yesterday,
"and if -we lose this struggle unionism
in San Francisco is dead. The men realize
this and all are determined to stand -by
their principles to the last ditch. It -is
true some 300 members of the Porters'
and Packers' Union did not obey the or
der to strike, but they will be dealt with
by the union when the trouble is oven"
Many of these have sought to evade ex
pulsion by resigning, but their resigna
tions will not be accepted. Six men in
the employ of George W. Glbbs & Co.
filed typewritten resignations to-day. As
soon as received the letters were returned
to the senders. Of course no resignations
from unions in^ times of strikes are ever
considered. . Our loss In this respect has
almost been made -up by the number of
applications for membership received
during the last .three days. 'We are get
ting along well and we shall win this
fight."
Three Hundred Union Porters Dis-
obey Strike Order.
WITHDRAWALS NOT AiLLOWED-
at 8 o'clock In the morning and continued
until late in the afternoon but one-fourth
of the strikers received their allowance.
The paying will be commenced again to
day at 12 o'clock.
The sums which were paid to the men
varied according to the extent of their
families and a great part of the day Â¦was
consumed fn computing the* amounts re
quired in each separate case. Single men
were allowed on an average of $3 each.
whtle the men with families received from .
$6 to $12. Through the entire day hun
dreds of the striking teamsters came and
went from the headquarters.- Not the
least disturbance occurred. The men for
the most part received their benefits and
left at once for their homes. .
The brotherhood claims that it has
money enough in its treasury to last for
several weeks to come. The International
Brotherhood has offered to assist the
strikers financially but thus far the offer
has not been accepted. .Â¦;: .-â¢< . V.'V

Arthur Rees Arrested Through tho
Detective Work of a Yotmg,j^,
. Lady.
Arthur Rees, 20 years old and residing
at 209 Stelner street, was arrested last
evening by Detective Tom Gibson and two
charges of forgery were registered against
him at the Hall of Justice. He is accused
of having forged the names of William
Rayhill, a livery stable keeper at 627
Haight street, and Ed Hinkle, a racehorse
man. to orders of $20 each, drawn respec- .
tively on James R. Kelly of the Hibernia -
Bank and Sam Bernhard of the Bernharci
mattress factory. Rees attempted to real
ize again by using Rayhill's name, and his j
capture was the result of clever detective *-
work on the part of Miss Kelly. â¢- Â¦Â¦ -''
On July 20 Rees sent a boy to Bernfcard
with the "order purporting to be from
Hinkel and received the money. On Au
gust 1 he presented the first order at the.
Kelly residence from , RayhiH and the
amount was paid him. without any hesi
tation. Yesterday afternoon he sent Clyde
Blair, a seven-year-old boy residing at 51Â»
Turk street, to the Kelly home at 309
Leavenworth again with an order, wnicb.
was presented to Miss Kelly. The lady
became suspicious and told the youngster
to call in the evening. In the interim sho
telephoned to the stable and found the
order to be a forgery. Then she notified
Captain of Detectives Seymour, and - he
detailed Detective Gibson on the case.
When the Blair boy applied at the house
last evening he was questioned by the of
ficer and told to walls' direct to the man
who had sent him. He followed directions
and the arrest of Kees followed at Hyde
and Eddy streets. - ;
The prisoner confessed. His parents are
well-to-do people, but he is regarded as
an incorrigible youth. Two years ago he
was a companion of Sana Anderson,, -who
robbed his employers of $800 on a check
drawn on the Crocker-Woolworth Bank,
and was at that time arrested, also by
Detective Gibson.

Dies While Sawing Wood.:
John Gonau, an aged contractor residing
at 1343 Seventh avenue, was sawing wood
last evening and dropped dead. Death is
supposed to have been due to heart dlsr

"I cannot answer that. We will await
the result of Monday's conference. - We
have made no threats thus far, arid we
shall not begin now. What we want is
an early adjustment of this affair. We
will do all we can to secure it, without the
sacrifice of all our principles as union men
and our dignity as honest workingmen."
"Will other unions be called out?"
"Should the terms proposed by the Em

follow?" was asked.
"War," replied Mr. Furuseth. -
"I was informed by Mayor- Phelan to
day that he had strong hope of effecting a
peaceful settlement of the "dispute. He
declined to make the letter of the Em

because he said it was against public pol
icy to do so." ' ' â¢
"We shall not consent to yield up the
only rights we have as laboring men.
We decline to allow the employers to rule
the industries of this city as did the
Council of Ten in the dark days of Ven
ice's history. We are willing to meet the
issue raised by the employers in a spirit
of fairness, but at the same time we de
mand that the employers consider the
questions involved In this struggle, in the
same spirit. The members of the Em

disposition thus far, but nevertheless we
are willing to wait until Monday before
finally deciding what steps are to be taken

stale at this time is this: We have decided to
request a number of affiliated unions to hold
cpecial meetings at the earliest opportunity, and
place strike power in the hands of their execu
tive committees, such committees to act Â¦when
reauested by the executive committee of the
Labor Council. No union -Brill be requested to
etrike Monday. The executive committee will
meet to-morrow at 2 p. m. to further consider
the situation.
Truce Till To-Morrow.
The executive board of the City Front
Federation met late in the afternoon.
Secretary Furuseth explained the latest
development and after an hour's discus
sion the board decided to comply with
the Mayor's request.
Mayor Phelan got nothing but disap
pointment from his meeting yesterday
with the directors of the Employers' As
sociation. Only two or three of them
were present and they gave their indorse
ment to the letter by Attorney Michael,
a document which evidently would de
stroy hope of conclusion of the strike at
this time were It made public, for Mayor
Phelan jealously guards the secret of its
contents. The Mayor at once set on foot
a movement to urge all the directors of
inÂ© association to attend- a- meeting to
morrow. He interested leading merchants
in the cause and he hopes that their in
fluence will result in a meeting that will
settle beyond doubt the question 6f the
final stand to be taken by the association.
This done the Mayor met Andrew Furu
geth, secretary of the Sailors* Union cf
the Pacific, and other labor leaders and
urged upon them that no action be taken
at meetings of their organizations that
would destroy hope of Immediate peace
until after the directors* meeting to-mor
row noon. - .
p*T"<i HOUGH absolutely nothing was
1 1 accomplished yesterday in the
It way of agreement to terms of
ii, peace between the Employers'
Association and. the City Front
Federation the danger of an Immediate
extension of the strike to additional
unions or to other parts of the coast waa
averted. Conditions will remain ' un
changed now until to-morrow afternoon,
â¢when a last attempt at settlement of the
difficulty by conference will be made.
"The officers have no right to drive these
men off the streets. In Judge Sloss 1 de
cision against the waiters, which was
handed down a few days ago, he states
specifically that 'picketing* is not illegal.
Just where the police officers, in view of
this fact, get their authority to act to
wards these men as they did to-day Is be
yond my knowledge."
chosen the best men from among- the
members of the unions for picket duty.
They have been instructed to . keep a
v.-atchf ul eye upon the conduct of their
fellow members and help the police of
ficers in quelling disturbances. The fact
that there have been no serious disturb
ances is evidence that they have per
formed their duty well. The police do not
appreciate the fact that, these pickets can
control the men. If we removed them
they would soon find that out and trouble
for which they could not hold ine or any
one else responsible would occur. - -
Attorney Michael's last letter is still
kept under lock and key. Mayor Phelan
will not give it out for publication, nor
will he submit it to' the labor leaders until
It shall have received Â¦ the Indorsement of
the full directorate of the Employers' As
sociation. . - Â¦ ..
When noon came but two or three di
rectors were present. The Mayor went
into conference with them, and after
stating his reason for desiring the meet
ing called he was informed that the
"more explicit" statement made by At
torney Michael met with their approval.
The directors present were obdurate, none
of them desiring to see the association
recede in any degree from the stand it
had taken, and Mayor Phelan left the of
fice without having made the slightest
progress towards the desired settlement.
The Mayor decided that one more effort
should be made. He met representatives
of the labor organizations at his office
shortly after 2 o'clock and explained the
situation to them. He asserted he had
good reason to believe that the stand
taken' by these few directors was not rep
resentative and that a full meeting of the
directors- .would result In action that
might result in a settlement of the labor
difficulty. He assured the labor represen
tatives that prominent merchants were in
terested in his efforts to bring about an
understanding and that these men had
pledged themselves to help secure a full
attendance of the directors of the Em
ployers* Association to be .held to-mor
row, and he asked that all measures look
ing to extension of the strike or to a
more rigid tie-up of the water front or
wholesale district be postponed till after
such meeting could be held. -
The Mayor was informed that his re
quest would be submitted to the executive
board of the City Front Federation and
to the executive committee of the San
Francisco Labor Council, which bodies
must decide whether further time for
negotiations be granted or not.
. In the forenoon the Mayor had notified
Mr. Michael that . his reply to the last
letter from the City Front Federation was
not satisfactory and that he desired that
a meeting of the directors be called. Steps
were at once taken by Mr. Michael to
notify the directors, the hour of meeting
being set at 12.

Dr. Vosburgh, it Is understood, \ was
willing to take up the work here, provided
the church met his views concerning the
salary which should be paid. The original
offer" to the Michigan clergyman was $2500
a year, but by formal vote the church
members increased that to $3000, and this
figure was agreeable to the distinguished
Baptist preacher and theological' teacher.
As soon as the final arrangements have
been completed, Dr. Vosburgh will leave
for a month's vacation In the mountains.
He intends to take a breathing spell
among the higher altitudes of the Sierra
Nevadas, that he may be invigorated for
his new field of activity in California.
This was planned unofficially in order that
the new pastor-elect might have the rest"
which he declared was necessary, as he
had not enjoyed a day of vacation during
ten years of active labor In the Bast.
The members of the church are much
gratified over the selection " of Dr. Vos
burgh, who has high standing in the
Baptist denomination of: the United
States. He occupies a prominent position
as a theologian and has given to the re
ligious world valuable contributions In the
shape of literary productions.
The announcement was made to-day
that Rev. H. J. Vosburgh has accepted
the call to the First Baptist . Church pas
torate as successor to Rev. C. H. Hobart,
who went to Pasadena. The formal de
cision will be given to the congregation
at to-morrow morning's services.

The drift of the population toward the

half the people will have taken up their

rural life. When a system shall have
been adopted which combines, as far as
practicable, city life with agricultural pur
puits there will be less immigration from
the farm. The founders of future cities
will undoubtedly keep this in ' view.âDal

While Mme. Sarah Bernhardt and M.

Warsaw of the death of Varabowski, an
old soldier of /he Napoleonic campaigns,
and said to be the last of the partisans or
adherents of the young Duke of Relchs
tadt. Varabowski. who attained the rank
of lieutenant in the Grande Armee, and
who fought at Waterloo, reached the age
of 105 years. A Pole by birth, he threw
his lot with the French, and joined a se
cret society of Bonapartists formed in the
reign of Louis XVIII. by Berton and two
other superior officers who had served
under Napoleon. The conspirators called
themselves the Knights of Liberty, and in
1822 they went about boldly proclaiming
their intention to restore the empire, with
theAiglon, or the Duke of Relchstadt, at
its head. The knights were joined by

however, the Knights came to grief. The
Mayor of that tqwn. a strong Royalist,
assembled the garrison of the military

The Knights did not o-ter any resistance,

Upon complaint of the nroprietors of
Barnum's restaurant William Jensen.
Manuel Rodgers and Henry Cole, plcke'3
of the Cooks' and Walters' Alliance In
front of the nlace, were arrested to-night
on charges of rl'sturhlner the peace.
Antone Pagse. proprietor of the boycot
ted restaurant, said that he would carry
en the fight in the courts to a definite
conclusion. He claims that all his men
are remaining with him and are satisfied
with their hours and wages. .
P. S.â The rest day of the entire organization
will depend upon the outcome of the issue of
which we ask your assistance. Â¦ :\~.k
This communication has received the sanc

spectfully. Cooks* & "Walters' Alliance.
HARRY COLE (Per S.>.
The Cooks' and Â¦Waiters'. Alliance. Local J?o.
a of Oakland, with a membership of 20S. re
ouest that you withdraw your patronage from
Barnum's restaurant. On June 3, Levorel &
Pagge, as members of the Employers' Associa
tion of Oakland, entered Into an agreement
with the Cooks* & Waiters* Alliance to give
their employes a weekly rest day. They con
tinued to do so until this week. Their state
ment that their employes did not desire the
weekly rest day has been investigated and haa
teen found to be untrue. They being of for
eign birth and not conversant with the Eek
ll.Â«h language, are fearful of assertions: a pro
test. The request made that you withdraw
your patronage for a short time Is so trifling
and the results will be so effective that we
have no doubt but that you will readily
accede.
"We wÂ«re prepared for this move and
have retained counsel to look after the
legal end cf the matter. The case will be
fought to a standstill Â«n court. We have
no resentment against this means taken
by Barnum's to carry onÂ«their fight. Of
course, each sirle has a right to da what
it can to win out. We t'aink we have the
best case and expect to gain a decision.
"In the meantime we are ready with
another -way of reaching the restaurant
aftefr cur pickets are taken off. We have
prepared a list of the patrons of Barnum's
and will address a letter to each one ask
ins them to withdraw their patronage."
The circular letter which will be mailed
to the addresses on â¢ the list above men
tioned is as follows:
Mr. :
It is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed
that upon plaintiff flllng an undertaking herein

servants, agents and employes, enjoining and
restraining them while stationed or picketed
or marching up and down In front of the
plaintiff s place of business mentioned and de

by threats or otherwise any person or persona
in the employ of the plaintiff to leave such

person or persons from dealing with or pa

and while so picketed, stationed or, marching
from preventing or attempting to prevent by
the use of the words "unfair"' or "unjust" as
applied to the plaintiff or his said business or

from dealing with or patronizing said plaintJS

It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed
that defendants and each of them show cauao
before Department No. 3 of this court at thÂ«Â«
Courthouse in the city of Oakland, county of
Alameda. State of California, on the 9th day

erty lyinÂ«r between the water front. Four
teenth Btreet. Market street and the north
arm of the estuary to appear on Monday,
August 12, before the Board of Equaliza
tion to show cause why the assessed valu
ation of the property should not be raised
to the amount shown on. the records as
<lue upon mortgages. ;.' ;
The purpose of this move is to bring
the assessments up to at least the face
of the mortgages as represented upon the
rolls. It Is claimed by those who have
been preparing the lists for the Board of
Eauaflzatlon that there is in the district
Â¦wnlch has been Included In the notice
." of to-night a difference of $250,000 between
the assessed valuation and the mortgages.
The figures. It Is asserted, show that the
assessment Is a Quarter of a million dol
lars less than the mortgages recorded
against the properly.
The Contra Costa Water Company filed
applications to-day for a reduction of
$1,000,000 on its franchise assessment. The
affidavits, which* were made by William
J. Dlngee. president of the company, axe
on e line with those upon which the com
pany secured a reduction of $1,400,000 on Its
franchise assessments at the hands of the
Board of Supervisors. The company
claims that its franchises are not as
ee&s&ble, but should It be decided that
they are subject to assessment they
ehould be assessed In San Francisco. The
hearing 1 on the applications was set for
next Tuesday night.
"For five years," said "Creed to-night,
"my pension has been drawn by the
widow pf my cousin, .whose name was
John M. Creed, exactly the same as mine.
The woman's name was Sally Miller be
fore she married and she is now living in
Fairfield, Lancaster County, Ohio. She
knew of my enlistment and took advan
tage of that knowledge and of her hus
band's name to get my pension. Her hus
band was dead when she first applied. I
do not expect to get back pav. but I
expect matters to be straightened im
mediately and the illegal payments
stopped. The pension amounts to $8 a
month."
Creed joined the Eighty-fifth Ohio Regi
ment-on a three months' enlistment in
1862. At the end of his time he joined the
Seventeenth Ohio and remained in the
latter regiment until the close of the war.
He marched with Sherman to the sea
and fought at Chickamauga. Stone River,
Buzzard Roof and other places. He was
/wounded at Chickamauga.
Creed resides at the corner of Rose and
California streets, this city, and is a
farmer.
Four years ago the veteran applied for
aid from the Government. His application
lav among hundreds of others month after
month and then came the announcement
that his widow had been receivine the
money. Investigation followed with re
markable results.
BERKELEY, Aug. 3.â According to
John M. Creed a pension due him from
this, Government as a veteran in~the Civil
War has been drawn for the last five
years by a woman who claims to be his
widow. Creed has just discovered' the
fraud through a special agent from the
Pension Bureau, who has been investi
gating the case for several months. The
agent declares Creed to be the rightful
pensioner.
The woman also said she was from Mis
souri. At the hospital she refused to take
any medicine and her teeth were badly
broken in the attempt to force her Jaws
apart. In spite of her opposition a wedsre
was finally inserted in her mouth and the
jaws forced apart to admit the adminis
tration of emetics and antidotes. Â¦
When called by her name Mrs*. Hilton
nearly broke down arid asked how the
hospital attendants had learned it. On
being told that it was on the telegrams in
her eatchel she relapsed into silence apaln
after remarking that they should find out
nothing further.
Mrs. Hilton was well dressed in a dark
traveling suit and carried little luggage.
From the tenor of the dispatches it is
surmised that she is a bookkeeper or clerk
on her way to occupy a position at Red
ding. From a remark she made to Police
Sergeant Green while riding from the
station to the hospital it seems that she
has previously attempted suicide.
*Tve made a success of the job this
time, she said.
To the hospital steward Â«he woman ad
mitted that she had taken chloral, but re
fused to say who she was or why she had
taken the. narcotic. Antidotes were
promptly administered and late to-night
the Patient seems likely to 'recover,
though still in a precarious condition. Two
telegrams found on her person established
her identity. One is dated Redding, Au
gust Â£ and is addressed to Mrs. Cora Hil
ton, Emigrant Gap. It reads:
Come at once. Need you. Store can't get
along. Bookkeeper and cashier rrant to be re
lieved. PRINCE.
The other bears the same signature and
date and reads:
"Wait for third letter. PRINCE.
A woman griving her name as Mrs. Cora
Hilton, and who seemed to be about 23
years old, took poison on the overland
train from the East this afternoon and
was brought to Oakland for treatment.
She boarded the train at Emigrant Gap,
and her ticket reads from that point to
Redding. When the train reached the
mole at 5 o'clock the Pullman sleeper in
which the would-be suicide was riding
was switched up to the First street and
Broadway station, only four blocks from
the Receiving Hospital, and she was
taken in a carriage to the hospital for
treatment. Her fellow passengers knew
nothing further of the matter than that
the woman suddenly fell,, writhing and
goaning with pain, to the car floor. This
w *s at about 2 o'clock, when the train was
at Colfax.

."More llian usual difficulty Is Â¦ experienced In
'making a detailed report of the operations In

closed, for the reason that there are many
wells which are nominally being drilled, but
on which work Is temporarily suspended or Is
proceeding very slowly. The low price of oil
-and the great heat In a number of fields have
combined to make It desirable that little work
be done, though many plans are maturing: for
beginning more active development work about
September 1. The statistics herewith presented
show but forty less rigs and wells drilling
than were reported a month ago, but the ac
tual number of men employed in the fields has
been reduced at a considerably heavier rate.
One month ago it was shown that: there had
been a tendency to close up work on wells be

tion to the entire 1,'retliral Tract.
GR AX-SOLVENT is the Wonder oÂ«
tbe Century. Discovered by the Chemist
Fabrion. quickly interested the rreat Scien-
tist and Physician. Erdman. who developed It
and proclaimed that marvelous action In
Urethral ailments which electrified the world.
- At enormous expense THE ST. JAMES
ASSOCIATION outstripped all competitors
and secured exclusive control on the Western
Gran-Solvent 1s not a liquid. It Is prepared
In the form of Crayons or Pencils, smooth and
flexible, and 60 narrow, as to pans the closest
Stricture.
STRICTURE,
The great virtue in the method of np-
plieation is its direct and positive action.
Ko vile, drastic drugs to ruin the stomach and
digestive system. The Crayons are Inserted
upon retiring at night, dissolving by the heat
end secretions of the body in three hours,
which Is sufficient time to penetrate and dls-
eolve ' *"--,'"..' :
dislodging the granular mass, root and branch.
together with the false membrane upon which
It forms, thoroughly medicating the Prostate
Gland, reducing Enlargement and contracting
the EJaculatory Ducts. forever stopping
drains and lonnes.
The alterative and antiseptic action of "Qran-
Bolvent" asserts Itself in destroying Gonococd
and the germs that Infest the bladder " and
Prostate Gland.
During the past year thousands of weak.
Â¦waKtingr wrecks were cured--an army of men
born ecaln to begin life anew with fresh vigor,
full of strength and the consciousness of re-
ctorcfl manhood. Under the Influence of this
sovereign solvent urethral stricture la dissolved
ani dislodged in 16 days.
From time Immemorial cutting and dilating
have filled up the brutal, fruitless record of
treatment In urethral stricture, and yet there
has never been one cure by such savage meth-
ods. The eagerness with which medical men
are applying for this Solvent Is an open confes-
eicn of their error In the pest. Over 800 lead-
ing physician* in the United States and Canada
have abandoned the knife and are employing
"Gran-Bolvent" In their practice as & humane
end unfailing agent.
VARICOCELE.
Varlcocole Is an accumulation of sluggish
blood In the veins of the Bcrotum, due solely
to Imperfect circulation, and has Its origin in
a diseased and torpid Prostate Gland. Opera-
tions in this disease are only temporary, and no
mechanical de\-ice yet discovered has cured a
single case. "Gran-Solvent" heals the Prostate
and restores healthy circulation. Varicocele
â¢Slsappeare and the rlug-?iÂ£h accumulation is
replaced by pure, healthy, red blood.

HOTEL ABRIVALS.
The conduct recommended in the foregoing
letter Is generally observed by the members of
this club, but there are some owners of auto
mobiles who have not learned to respect the
rights of others and who can be restrained
only by the strong arm of the law.
As the matter la now before your commit
tee I will ask that I be notified In advance of
any meeting- where the subject will come up
for discussion, and either myself or the attor
ney for the club will appear and ask the privi
lege to make such suggestions as may be de
sirable and proper.
Must Not Invite Hostility.
Until the horses become accustomed to this
strange machine there is bound to be accidents,
even with the greatest care, but It is the ut
most folly to Invite bitter hostility by indiffer
ence to the fears as well as the rights of those
who use horses. We are fond of saying that
the automobile has come to stay. So it has.
but while It Is being established we want to
get all the sport out of It that we can, and
our enjoyment will be seriously curtailed by
restrictive legislation unless we make friends
Instead of enemies of the traveling public
This can only be done by the utmost care and
even kindness to those whom we meet on the
roads. I desire especially to urge that you .
avoid mountalnour roads as far as possible. J
There - is no denying the fact that It is abso- <
lutely dangerous to the horse-propelled vehicle.
and its occupants to meet an automobile In
such a place. It Is quite true that no law can
keep you oft any public highway, but every
time you frighten a horse under such circum
stances you have made new enemies to our
sport, and we all have to suffer therefor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Aug. 3.
The automobilists of San Francisco have
appealed, through the president fcf their
organization. F. A. Hyde,' for a hearing
before the Board of Supervisors when the
petition of C. A. Plummer of Centerville
for passage of a restrictive ordinance
regulating the use of the machines shall
be taken up by th^ board.
. Plummer declares he deems regulation
of ths handling of the horseless vehicles
on county roads to be necessary because,
as he writes, "of the willful neglect of the
rights of those who- use vehicles drawn
by horses on the county roads of Ala
meda, through the presumptuous and
dangerous manipulation of automobiles
on the said roads."
President Hyde's Rejoinder.
President Hyde/ speaking for the Auto
mobile Club of California, writes as fol
lows:
I beg to express thÂ« conviction that Mr.
Plummer' Â¦ complaint is . In some cases 'well
founded and that It Is eminently proper that
the Board of Supervisors should by ordinance
remedy the evils of which he and others have
Just cause for complaint.
On this subject I quote as follows from a
circular letter sent by me on the 12th inst. to
the members of the club:
It Is observed that there is an Increasing
feeling of hostility manifested by the people
'around the bay of San Francisco against the
use of 'automobiles on the county roads and
driveways and this is due in a large measure
to the conduct of a few people (generally not
members of this club), who, by reckless driv
ing and lack of consideration for the occupants
of passing vehicles, have caused accidents and
fright to the drivers of horses. To the
thoughtless few I desire to say that It is not
a question of law, nor the rules of the road,
but common humanity as well as self-lntere3t
that should Impel you, when meeting a pass-
Ing vehicle, to first check your speed In every
case and move 'to one side and stop short
If you see that either the horse or the driver
Is frightened by your appearance.

It Is noteworthy that the bank return was
more nearly harmonious than usual, the gains
in loans and in cash together calling for an
increase of $13,133,700 in deposits, while this
Item was. actually increased by $12,973,700. .
The Increase of $2,280,200 in cash very closely
corresponds with that shown by preliminary
statements of the movements of money during
the week.
The Financier says: The statement of tha
New York Associated Banks last week showed
the comparatively unimportant reduction . of
$963,225 in surplus reserve, leaving this item -at
$22,165,350. This amount of reserve compares
with $29,14-4,875 a year ago. and It may be re
garded as ample to meet at least the early
requirements lor money for crop purposes.
Moreover, it should be noted that the bank
statement was made on rising averages for
cash, payments by the sub-treasury for Au-'
(rust Interest on Government bonds not having
been begun until Thursday, and the disburse
ment of almost $1,500,000 for this purpose did
not pass through the banks until Friday and
hence was not fully accounted for in the state
ment. Checks for Yukon gold to moderate
amounts were also cashed at the sub-treasury
on Friday, and therefore the payments were
too late to appear In last week's bank returns.
Hence it seemed probable that the condition of
the banks was more favorable at' the end of
the week j than appeared by the statement.
Among the influences operating in the- direc
tion of changes in bank conditions during the
week may -be noted the payment on Thursday
of about $17,000,000 on account of new bonds
issued by the Missouri Pacific and $10,000,000
new Rock Island stock. These payments were
reflected in important changes between local
banks and it is quite possible these disburse
ments likewise had more or less influence upon
interior bank movements. The gain of $10,853,
500 In loans was due in part to operations in
cident to the above noted payments. It is
shown by the statement of the changes by in
dividual banks that the First National Bank
increased Its .loans last week by $66,240,200,
doubtless In connection Â¦with its recent aug
mentation of capital and with Its preparations
for the absorption of the Bank of the Republic.
This, therefore, i will account . for a large part
of the gain in loans by all of the banks shown
last- week. - - .

â¢*A firm market for prunes, especially the

larly light supply. Eome large holders ask %c

yjiemand for prunes was very good all the week
{from the small trade. Peaches in boxes were
in good request from the consuming trade,
with supplies not plentiful. California raisins
were quiet, but 3-crown loose firmer at 5c.
â¢with some little demand. Imported raisins
were In some request, a better demand for
Malagas being in evidence from the summer
resort trade. Currants slumped during the
week from 9c to S%c for Amalias ajid were
easy at the close, with very little business
doing. Old currants were offered from Greece,
it Is understood, under 22s, but no buying was
heard of. The Greek market for new currants
became steadier late in the week, the lowest
price at which goods were offered being 18s.

The week's news from the corn belt gave
the first indubitable assurance that whatever
is left of -the Â¦ crop to be benefited wsj sure
of the requisite moisture. Notwithstanding
the various phases of the steej strike negotia
tions. Wall street followers clung to a con
viction that the ultimate outcome would be a
resumption of work and a continuance of the
wide-reaching prosperity of the industry. Yet
still the security markets have halted and the
"larger financial Interests" and the general
public have maintained a profound indifference
to the market. The dominant Influence on
speculative sentiment exercised by the steel
strike calls renewed attention to the propor
tions of the United States Steel Corporation
and the other projects in the railroad worid
which went hand In hand with it and from
closely identical origins. These projects repre
fcented a progress of capitalization of the enor
mous prosperity which the country had en-
Joyed for a number of years with a promise of,
continued enjoyment to- help on flotation of
new securities. It is easy to perceive now In
the retrospect the boldness of grasp with which
far-seeing capitalists seized the advantage of
vast accumulations of banking reserves to pro
vide themselves with the resources In the
shape of syndicate loans for the earrylng out
of uerhaps long cherished projects. On the
industrial side those centered about the United
States Steel Corporation and on the railroad
Eide about the extension of the so-called com
munity interests. It was after the steel com
bination had been fairly launched the Penn
sylvania Railroad had consolidated under its
influence the southerly trunk lines, the Penn
sylvania Coal Company had passed to the con
tori of the Erie, the New Jersey Central to the
Reading and the Southern Pacific had been
absorbed by the Union Pacific and the specu
lative world was ready to accept with avidity
any suggestion, however extreme, of consoli
dation of capital, that ~the Northern Pacific
quarrel brought home the fact that antago
nism and conflict of interest still existed "in
the world of capital. Even this quarrel was
turned to account ultimately by speculative
enthusiasm as a means by Its settlement of
still further and more effective combinations.
Uut other obstacles Intervened â the damage to
the crops, the steel strike and the dependency
of canltaJ upon a state of general confidence
for success in vast projects began to be shown.
The effort to support prices of securities by
sheer force of money proved unavailing. Bank
ers, do not feel safe to make loans freely to be
used for speculative purposes In the stock mar
ket pending the demand from the interior for
crop moving. The sluggish and irregular ac
tion of the stock market for this week affords
an indication that syndicates and large inter
ests are not Inclined to contest these obstacles
for the present and are disposed to let the
Etock market He fallow. â¢ â¢.

and narrow as stocks, but has shown evidence

gave promise of a compromise and a resump
tion of work. . Both tie United States Steel
stocks rose a point over last night and St.
Paul rose a point and a fraction. Prices
drifted aimlessly for the greater part of the
session. There was an advance of 3% In Con
solidated Gas for some unexplained reason
and gains of a point or more in United . States
Leather preferred. American Cotton Oil, Peo
pled Gas, Pacific Mall, St. Lawrence and such
Inconspicuous stocks. Selling orders appeared
when the bank statement was published,
whether for the purpose of taking profits by
room traders or from an unfavorable interpre
tation of that document would be hard to say.
The rather large increase In the loan item was
not a strengthening factor, but the increase in
cash largely offset its effect on the Jeurplus
reserve item. The selling at the 1 lasjtr though
Email, seemed urgent and carried prices rather
perceptibly to the lowest level of the day. The
closing itself was weak and near the lowest.
The railroad bond market was as far from
reflecting any demand for securities as that
for stocks, and was dull and heavy throughout.
The week in stocks has been a dull one. In
contrast with the two previous weeks, when
the Monday morning dip Â¦ made the low prices
for the week, the Monday morning bulge this
week erenerally made the highest. The mar
ket has been an exceedingly narrow one, both
in aoint of the amount of business done, the
number of different Issues dealt In and the
extent of the fluctuations. The news of Mon
day moraine gave promise of a rebound in
prices, in that relief was afforded from the
two principal depressing factors of the pre
vious period, the drought and the threatened
steel strike.

Morning Session.
.CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â The absence \ of ; cables
from Liverpool, that market being closed, left
wheat 'traders with nothing to contemplate but
a promising spring wheat crop oh .'top of the
big winter crop and the opening found the
crowd free sellers. September ranging from 68%
@68%c. At 68Vi@68%c the.decllna was checked
by evidences that the seaboard . clearances for
the day would be unusually heavy. Heavy pur
chases by a single operator. started an advance
in which the. crowd Joined later when .the size
of the clearances was confirmed and receivers
reported light offerings from the country. Â¦ The
market rose steadily to 69c. where a consider
able short interest was driven to cover and
a further 'advance to 69%(g)69%c ensued. On
the bulge longs in moderate force took profits
but the bulls strenuously opposed them and
the 'market closed strong, September, %@%c
higher than yesterday's close atÂ»69%c.
News of the corn crop was generally of one
tenorâ bad. One report which received marked
attention came from Iowa and predicted that
the condition of. the crop of that State would
not be over 40. The market, â¢ however, had an
easy opening owing to the weather forecast, Â¦
which promised rain. Selling for., a few mo
ments was urgent, but it was soon over. The
wheat strength started the reaction. A large
short Interest was exposed, -and many sold-out
bulls reinstated their lines, i For a â¢ time corn
was hard to get and the market rallied sharp
ly. Realizing sales on the advance caused a
decline of %c,' but the close 'was firm, "%c
higher at 57%c.
Oats followed the trend of the other grain
markets and ruled firm, following a slight dip
at the opening. September closed firm, }i@%c
over yesterday at, 35@35 1 /gc. Â¦
The provision market was steady. There
was some improvement in v the outside demand
and this, together with higher prices at - the
yards and in the grain pits, held values stead
ier, although fluctuations were narrow. Sep-'
tember pork closed unchanged,- larS a shade
higher and. ribs 2%c up. . ; ' .
. The leading futures ranged as' follows:' Â¦'
Weekly bank clearings show a gain over last year.
Silver advanced. Exchange unchanged.
