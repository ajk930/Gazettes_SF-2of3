attempt was made. Planned
with all the diabolical ingenuity
and finesse of which anarchy or
nihilism is capable, the would-be
assassin carried out the work
without a hitch, and should his
designs fail and the

step, while a pallor began to
steal over his features.

Then came a . commotion.
Three men threw themselves for

sprang toward the would-be as

were on the lookout, and whose
duty it was to guard against just
such a calamity as had here be

tion. The third was a bystander,
a negro, who had only an instant
previously grasped the hand of
the President. In a twinkling the
assassin was borne to the ground,
his weapon was wrested from

SCENE OF THE DARING ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT McKINLEY.
(DRAWN FROM A DESCRIPTION BY TELEGRAPH.)
For thb moment the confusion
was terrible. The crowd surged
forward regardless of conse

fought, women screamed and
children cried. Some of those
nearest the doors fled from the
edifice in fear of a stampede,
while hundreds from the outside
struggled blindly forward in the
effort to penetrate the crowded
building and solve tfte mystery
of the excitement and panic
which every moment grew and

â â *; AFTER HIS AKREST
At the Milburn house were
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson,
President Milburn, Director
General Buchanan of the Pan-
American Exposition, Dr. Rixey
and Secretary Cortelyou. Tele
grams poured in by hundreds
and Secretary Cortelyou was
kept busy replying to them. Two
stenographers with their type
writers were placed in the parlor,
which was quickly transformed
into a bustling room.
Secretary Cortelyou said that
a telegraph office would be estab
lished at once in the Milburn
residence, and bulletins giving
the public the fullest information
possible would be issued at short
intervals.
At 8:30 the reporter of the As
sociated Press was admitted to
the Milburn mansion, where Sec
retary Cortelyou gave him the
official bulletin prepared by the
physicians.

juncture.
They were the mind and the
hand and the eye and the voice
of President McKinley.
After the first shock of the as
sassin's shot he retreated a step.
Then as the detectives leaped
upon his assailant he turned,
walked steadily to a chair and
seated himself, at the same time
removing his hat and bowing his
head in his hands.

meanwhile admonishing those
about him to remain calm, and
telling them not to be alarmed.
"But you are wounded," cried
his secretary, "let me examine."
"No, I think not," answered
the President. "I am not badly
hurt, I assure you."
Nevertheless his garments were
hastily loosened and when a
trickling stream of crimson was
seen to wind its way down his
breast, spreading its telltale stain
over the white surface of the
linen, their worst fears were con
firmed.
A force of exposition guards
were soon on the scene, and an
effort was made to clear the
building. By this time the crush
was terrific. Spectators crowded
down the stairways from the gal
leries, the crowd on the floor
surged forward toward the ros
trum, while despite the strenuous
efforts of. police and guards the
throng- without struggled madly
to obtain admission.

President McKinley took the helm of
the old ship of state at a dark and threat

through troubles at j home and' abroad,
through the Spanish war to glorious and

complications, from industrial depression

PRESIDENT WELL
GTTABDED BY FOECE
OF DETAILED MEN
It was learned to-night from an authori
tative source that the greatest precautions
had been taken to . guard against -tho
possibility of any such occurrence as
transpired to-day. Not only were the ser
vices of the local police and detective
forces employed to the fullest extent, but
specially detailed men have accompanied
the Presidential party In all its travels
since inauguration day, and In addition to
this the extra precaution was taken upon
the occasion of the President's visit to
the Pan-American of having with - him
three United States Treasury secret ser
vice men of long experience and proven
ability. In fact, to such an extent has
this matter of the President's personal
safety been carried by_those responsible
for his welfare that it has given rise to
some criticism. Upon his visit to the
exposition it was felt by those surround
ing him that the President was liable to
greater chance of- danger than is usual,
even upon his travels, owingto the great
crowds, the diversified character of the
people assembled" and. the necessity for
direct contact with the crowds." For these
reasons the strict precautions above men
tioned were resorted to. Â¦
'.The President himself has always been
averse to any such protection, and the
sight of officers of "the law constantly
near his person has been distasteful. He
has always Instructed that in all his vis
its to various cities there should be at
least one public reception where he could
be brought face to face with the public
and give those who desired It the privi
lege of a personal meeting.

slightly, but did not fall.. Secretary Cor

Foster sprang to his aid, while Detective
Ireland and James B. Parker threw h*s
assailant: to the floor, hurled themselves
upon him and attempted to disarm him
Â¦ "Their .prisoner struggled desperately
and, wrenchJne his arm free, attempted
once more to fire at the President. The
revolver, . however, was struck from his
hand, flying several feet away.
"President McKinley himself plucked
from -his side the -bullet which had struck
the breastbone ' and glanced, lodging in
the skin, at the same time saying to tho
detective: 'Foster,- 1 believe there is an
other bullet In there.' an

anticipation that there may be no need
for meeting grave emergencies which
would follow a fatal termination ' of the
tragic event. Should the worst come,
however, it is realized that important
changes in the public affairs of the coun
try would soon be brought about.
Whether there would be an extra session
of Congress is open to question, but there
seems no doubt that an extra session of
the Senate would be essential as ah inci
dent to a change of administration. All
this has"~been thought of here only in the
vaguest manner, and confidence is almost
universal here, based on the President's
magnificent constitution, his present "ex
cellent physical condition and the tre
mendous strides that have been made
since Garfleld's time in surgery, that there
will be no occasion to resort to the con

For the present the thought of a fatal
termination of the President's condition
is referred to with awellke apprehension.
Under the terms of this article, as soon
as Roosevelt is assured by proper author
ity, probably in this case by the senior
member of the Cabinet, Secretary Hay,
who will doubtless be in Buffalo by to
morrow evening, he will undertake at
once in a provisional way to discharge
such duties ] as may . devolve upon him.
Much will depend upon the report of the
physicians upon the character of the
President's Injuries as to the extent to
which Roosevelt will discharge the Presi
dential duties, if he undertakes them at
all, and it is almost certain that in the
absence of great emergency In public af
fairs, even If called to assume these obli
gations, the Vice President will confine
himself in the exerd6e of his powers to
the discharge of the most routine and In
dispensable functions.

"6 â In case of the removal of the Presi
dent from office or of his death, resigna
tion or inability to discharge the powers
and duties of the said office, the same
shall devolve on the Vice President," etc.
Steps were next taken to provide for the
future of the executive branch of the
Government. It was realized [ that even
under most favorable conditions the Pres
ident's injuries are of such a character as
to make it almost certain that he cannot
undertake for a Ung time to discharge
the duties of chief executive even in the
most formal way. Every member of the
Cabinet able to travel is expected to speed
at once to Buffalo and there a Cabinet
council will be held to decide upon the
course to be followed by the executive
branch. Vice President Roosevelt is In
Vermont and of course will hold hlmselt
in readiness to do whatever is necessary
and to meet the obligations Imposed upon

Whfte House Attaches
Are Overcome by the
Fearful News.
Ranching, hunting and writing, however,
have been but episodes In the busy life
of Theodore Roosevelt. His chief work
has been In politics. His capacity for
leadership was recognized from the very
first session of his service in the Legis
lature. He was the leader of his party at
Albany and was chairman of the New
TorK delegation at the Republican conven
tion at Chicago which nominated Blaine.
So strong was the hold he had even then
upon his party and upon the public gen
erally that he was chosen by the Repub
licans to make the race for Mayor of New
York in 1S86 against the veteran Demo
cratic candidate, Abram S. Hewitt, and
Henry George.
The New York Press, reviewing the
course of that famous contest says:
"In proportion to the total Theodore
Roosevelt polled the largest vote ever cast
up to that time for a Republican candi
date for Mayor. He fought with the same
tireless energy and with the same aim In
view, at that time that he did in all po
litical contests subsequently. He was
bound by no promises, hampered by no
pledges and made his fight on the principle
of honesty. Industry and decency In the
administration of a public office. His po
litical opponents were actually astonished
at the strength he displayed. It cannot
be said that they were alarmed, because
they were too well buttressed and forti
fied by the corrupt machinery which they
had controlled so long to fear any candi
date who stood on merit and whose battle
cry was 'Right.'" .
The race was at best but a forlorn hope.
Capacity for Leadership.
THE foul blow struck at Pres
ident McKlnley and the dan

United States a new and a
deeper interest in the per
sonality and the record of
Vice President Roosevelt. He has hith
erto been in the popular estimation
something like a child of political fortune.
so brilliant and so successful has been his
career. He has had the favor of New
Tork clubmen and of Western cowboys,
and has been equally at home In the
drawing-rooms of Fifth avenue and on
the plains of Dakota. >
His political success In the past has
been somewhat easy for him. He is now
to be tried by the sternest tests that can
be put upon a statesman, and It is inevi
table that in this dread emergency the
people should turn again to study Roose
velt's record In order to draw from It as
surances that should the President die his
successor will be worthy to fulfill the high
office to which he will be summoned.
The more carefully the record is consid
ered the more assured will the country
become of Roosevelt's personal worth and
genuine greatness of character. He will
not be another McKlnley; in fact, he Is
too original a man to be like any of his
predecessors In the Presidency, but every
step of his past career shows that he
yields to none of them In patriotism. In
tegrity and stalwart manhood.
Early Political Career.
Theodore Roosevelt Is a member of an
old Dutch family which settled in this
country about the middle of the seven
teenth century. He was born In New
Tork City, October 27, 1858, and was pre
pared for Harvard by private tutors. At
the university hla career was distin
guished and gave evidences . of those
characteristics -which have since made
him so notable a figure In the nation. He
took a leading part in college athletics
and at the same time exhibited such abil
ities as a writer that he was chosen one
of the editors of the Journal of the under
graduates, the Harvard Advocate.
Immediately after graduating Roosevelt
spent a year in foreign travel, and Im
mediately upon his' return entered ac
tively upon a political career. He sat In
the New York Legislature during the ses
sions of 1S82 and the two following years.
At the very beginning of his political ac
tivity he showed a marked degree of per
sonal independence and an earnest zeal
for the purification of New Tork politics
from the evils which permeate it. His
first effort In that direction was taken by
introducing a civil service bill In the Leg
islature, and despite the antagonism of
the supporters of the spoils system he>
succeeded In bringing about the passage
of the measure in 1833.
That success gave him at once a high
degree of prestige in politics, and from
that time on he has been widely known.
His fondness for travel and adventure
and out-of-door life led him to engage In
ranching in Dakota between 1884 and 1838.
There he developed Into an enthusiastic
and energetic ranchman and hunter, and
acquired that familiarity with Western
life and Western men that has made him
In the broadest sense a representative
American instead of a mere New Torker.
It was there also that he gained that liv
ing interest in the upbuilding of the West
which he has 30 abundantly manifested In
some of the best known and most valu
able of his writings.
At the War Department General Gilles
ple, chief of engineers of the army, was
acting Secretary in the absence of Secre
tary Root, who Is 111 at his summer home
in Southampton, L. L, and Assistant Sec
retary Sanger, who is away on leave. He
also had quitted the building, but he had
not been gone half an hour before word
reached him and he hastily returned to
his desk. He immediately sent a message
vto the Secretary of War and to General
./Brooke, commanding the Department of
the East, giving euch unofficial informa
tion as was available, in order to apprise
them, of the main facts as they Wer m
Mr. Adee. the acting head of the r>e
partment of Btate, had quitted the city
for his cummer home some miles distant
from Laurel, Md., and the chief clerk of
the department was absent with the visit
ing diplomats at Buffalo. In the Navy
Department Mr. Hackett, the acting Sec
retary, who had also quitted the building,
was speedily recalled by Captain Cowes,
the acting head of the Navigation Bu
reau, and he immediately put himself in
readiness to take any official action that
might be necessary to meet the emer
gency. At Buffalo, In the exposition
grounds, the navy had a splendid repre
sentation in the shape of a marine bat
talion under Captain Leonard, and this
force will be made immediately available
if it is desired by the persons, about the
President that a guard be near his per
son. '"-:Â¦"-â¢ *-'
Officials Act Promptly.
The work of the official day was done
when the news of the great calamity ar
i rived, and the Â«xectxtive departments had
nearly emptied themselves of their work
men and very few officials were to be
found at their desks.
The force at the White House since the
President's departure has been in con
stant communication Â¦with him, and while
he has conducted much of the business
of his office at his home in Canton the
majority of the papers with which he has
to do have been prepared In Washington
and forwarded through the "White House
clerical force. All reports received from
him by officials here were cheerful and
high spirited.
They recalled with great satisfaction
the fact that when the President left
"Washington he was In most robust health
and excellent spirits and that he bade all
an affectionate farewell. It was recalled
also that Mrs. McKlnley said this circum
stance had much to do with the Presi
dent's own condition later on. When he

only persons about the mansion.

The telephone eystem of the city was
simply paralyzed for a time, and so many

upon the officials who might be supposed
to hare some knowledge of the details of

abroad regarding: the reception of the

discussion of mean's to prevent anarchist

and the urgent need of the adoption of
greater police precautions than ever in

The Figaro pays a warm tribute to the

the explanation of the crime is not to be

BERLIN. Sept. Â«.â King Edward was
traveling from Frankfort to Hamburg
when the news of the attempt upon the
life of President McKlnley was received
and a telegram was at once dispatched to
meet him, acquainting him with the deed.
The Altona-Kell Railway was strongly
guarded by a large force of police and it
cannot be doubted that this latest an
archistic attempt will result in the re
doubling of police precautions upon the
Continent, la vit-w of the various imperial
meetings now occurring.
If there had ever been any likelihood
that the Czar would go to Paris, It may
now be regarded as a certainty that he
will not go. lie had already decided yes

King Edward Receives News.
Mr. and Mrs. Nat C. Goodwin and other
Americans who were to have dined at the
Carleton to-night canceled their engage
ments on hearing the news, and all the
orchestras ceased playing. Crowds sur
rounded the bulletin boards^ *
The Lord Mayor of London was In
formed of the attempt upon the Presi
dent's life by a press representative, and
expressed the greatest grief and emotion.
He eaid: "I shall call a meeting of the
Aldermen to-morrow formally to express
to Mrs. McKinley and the American peo
ple the horror and grief felt at the at
tempt. Personally the news comes to me
with the greatest possible chock, and I
am sure that every citizen of London will
join me in expressing feelings of sorrow
at the terrible calamity."
C. L. Pullman, recalling a conversation
with President McKinley a few weeks
ago, said: "I had been telling the Presi
dent of my experiences In Russia, where
I found rt easier to get to the Czar than
to him. Mr. McKlnley said he believed
It would fall to the lot of some of the
great White House men before many
years had passed to control the destinies
of Xorth and South America."
Comparatively few Englishmen heard
the news to-night, but all these expressed
hcrror and sympathy as genuine as if It
had been the King: instead of a President.
Jlr. McKinley's kindly personality, his
friendship for England and his kindly
messages of condolence upon the occasion
of Queen Victoria's death were all called
up in \oices as low and awe-stricken as
those of any purely American gathering.
A correspondent conveyed the Intelli
gence to J. TV. Mackay, Thomas Ochlltree,
G. L. Pullman. J. "W. Gates and many
others, all of whom desired to express
their indignation at the cowardly act, the
deepest sympathy with Mr. McKlnley and
hope* for his recovery. Added to this per
sor.al sentiment was the dread that what
ever the outcome of the outrage upon the

to Mrs. McKinley.

"All my public life has been devoted in
effort to give the workingmen the best
opportunity for good wages and steady
employment. When labor is well employed
the country is safe; and when labor is
well employed there is contentment and
happiness in the house* of the laboring
men."
In this city, on May 19, at the launch
ing of the Ohio, he splendidly apostro
phized free labor and recognized its dig
nity and its influence:
"Thank God! we have no classes in the
United States, and we have no platform
except our country and our constitution."
eulogizing the arts of peace, he added:
"We know no Imperialism In the United
States except the imperialism of a sov

pressed the noil of California when, at
Redlands, May 8, he again. upheld that
freedom which some demagogues now
assert for themselves and deny to their
fellows: "Our triumphs are those of a
free, self-governing people, looking to the
development and upbuilding and exten

the town of Monterey, May 12, rapidly
approaching this metropolis, he scented
a danger, which we are now experiencing,

SECRETARY JOHN HAT. who

President, was born at Sa

tice before the Supreme Court In the early
part of 1S61.
He went to Washington with Mr. Un
coin as assistant secretary when tiie lat
ter was inaugurated, and remained with
him until his death. He also acted as his
adjutant and aid-Ce-camp, and on the oc
casion of Early's threatening of Wash
ington, in 1864. he took tho field on the
staff of General David Hunter, and later
was with General Gllmore.
In March, 1865", he was appointed secre
tary of the legation to France, which
position he held until March, 1867. when' |
he retired. Tn May following he.w.ia ap
pointed secretary of the legation to Aus
tria-Hungary, where he acted as Charge
d' Affaires until August, 1S68. In June.
1869, he was made secretary of the lega
tion to Spain, but retired in October, 1S70.
He then became an editorial writer on
the New. York Tribune, where he re

time he was editor in chief.
In 1875 he removed to Cleveland and de

1S73, and served until May 3. 1881. when he
retired. In that Vear he represented the
United States at the International Santl
tary Congress, which sat at Washington,
and -was elected I president of that body.
On March 10, 1397, Mr. Hay was appointed
by President McKinley. as Embassador
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten
tiary to Great Britain, which high office
he resigned September 19, 1S&8, ,to become Â¦
Secretary of State, a position he has ably
filled ever since.
It Is to be noted that Mr. Hay in his
public career has been closely associated
with the three Presidents who have been
made objects of assassin's bulletsâLin
coln, Garfleld and McKinley.
. Mr. Hay enjoys considerable reputation
as a writer. His "Castllian Days," "Pike
County Ballads" and "Abraham Lincoln:
A History," written in conjunction with
John. G. NIcolay, are widely and favor
ably known.
And the next day, at Austin, Tex., he
held bis countrymen to this ideal: "We
must not be unfaithful to our high mis
! slon or falter before Its high responsibili
ties, nor must we permit might or pride
' to taint our motives and lead us from the
plain paths of duty or divert us from the
eaer^d principle* of liberty." Within three

"The happiest people In the world are

At TVesson. Miss., as afterward at San
Francisco, he addressed himself to wage
earners:
Famous Words to Toilers.
THE attempted assassination
of President McKinley is the
direct outcome of the toler
ation in the United States of
European anarchy, inspired
and stimulated by the New
Tork Journal, the Chicago
American and the San Fran
cisco Examiner, the triple
headed monster of the press. The un
bounded confluence -which the President
reposed In the American people was and
is wen founded, but he failed to realize
the lawless and murderous spirit that
smolders in the dregs of population, re
cruited from aboard and encouraged by
traitors to Americanism and to human
ity at home.
The anarchists have kept their -word.
After the murder of Humbert by an an
archist domiciled in New Jersey they
promised that their next victim should be
the President of a republic. Whatever
the result may be â though Mr. McKinley
nay be preserved by a. merciful Provi
dence and the American people saved
from a great anguishâ the act and the in
tent have combined to produce the great
est crime of the twentieth century- The
Polish -wretch who fired the shots Is a
mere tool and will suffer the ordinary
consequence of imprisonment or death,
as the result may legally warrant.
But the true responsibility will be con
centrated upon the criminals behind the
pistol, who have used literary skill and
the resources of art to thwart the just
and equal administration of the law, to
bring all the administrators of govern
ment into disrepute, to insult coarsely,
brutally and unremittingly the highest
representatives of the people, to carica
ture and vilify our wounded President in
every low and contemptible manner that
malignity could employ, to replace Amer
icanism by the villainous theories of the
worst classes of revolutionists, and cause
lessly and wantonly to promote disorder
and violence at a time of profound peace
and unexampled prosperity.
When the President was in San Fran
cisco he was constantly under the pro
lection cf the same police force that now
endeavors by the performance of its duty
to negative the efforts of the Examiner
to incite personal assaults and even riots
among the limited number cf the danger
ous class among the strikers who bow to
its influence. But Mr. McKinley, not
withstanding the assassinations of Lin
coln and Garneld and the anarchistic lit
erature that disgraced journalism, could
not be made to comprehend the existence
of danger In a large and thriving Ameri
can community devoted to American in
stitutions and to the American flag.
Had L T o Fear of Assassins.
"While he was unostentatiously exhibit-
Ing the depth of American statesmanship,
the breadth of American patriotism and
the simple fidelity to domestic obligations
of an American gentleman, and attracting
and receiving the gentle sympathy and
the Intelligent respect of untold thousands
of his fellow citizens, without distinction
of class, party or creed, he was uncon
scious that the criminal elements here and
elsewhere throughout the Union had been
gradually and persistently educated to the
European conception of murder as a fine
art. It is fortunate for California that
the logic of this horrible training did not
receive its culminating demonstration
while he was on the Pacific Coast. It is
still more fortunate that the climax^ was
reached when he had found and to* the
uttermost used the greatest opportunity
ever offered to man to exemplify to the
world the true meaning of American civ
ilization and of American progress.
Lincoln died when his pathetic an
nouncement of "charity toward all and
malice toward none," in the closing scenes
of a bloody war, had touched the nobility
of the North and sweetened the heart of
the South. Garfield. after his long strug
gle, yielded up the ghost when he was
recognized at home and abroad as an il
lustration of the elevating force of our po
litical system. Mr. MeKinley, whether he
lives or dies, stands as the foremost rep
resentative of consolidated Americanism,
true to the sovereignty of man, within the'
restraints of the constitution and of the
law, as it has been vindicated by the
birth, the growth and the present altitude
of the American republic Â«*-
There could be no better occasion briefly
to recall and to impress upon American
men and women, who believe In their coun
try, a few of those sentences uttered by
Mr. McKinley on the way to California,
in which he condensed the lessons of our
national history, and which constitute
burning retorts to the pessimistic anar
chists of the day. At Decatur, Tenn., on
April 30 of the present year, he struck the
keynote of his subsequent inspiration
when he caid:
"'We have no North, no South, no East,
no West, but are all Americans." On the
same day at Tuscombia, Tenn., after de
picting our restored national unity in
terms that will live, he honored popular
government by saying: i
"We are your agents. The President
and Congress are but the representatives
of the public will, and bo long as the peo
ple arc united, so long- as their homes are
virtuous, so loner as the public schools of
our country continue to educate the chil
dren In the paths of patriotism and loy
alty and Intelligence and morality, so
* long will this great Government rest se
curely and advance triumphantly to its
highest destiny."

- "Jlajor General Samuel B. M- Young,
commanding the United . States military
forces of the Pacific coast, while sitting 1
at his desk at anny headquarters received
the news that the President had been
shot The intelligence -was communicated
through, the office of Adjutant General
Babeock to the commander of the post at
the Presidio and to other post command
ers of the department- During his recent
sojourn In Washington General Voung
was the guest of the President on several
occasions.
The shooting of the President and the
fear expressed that the injuries may
prove fatal were matters discussed by lo
cal surgeons last night Up to 11 o'clock
no definite statement as to the wound nor
a precise relation of the symptoms had
been received in this city.
X number of leading surgeons were
Questioned 'as to their- views concerning
the President's chances for recovery. The
opinion Becmed to prevail that the recov
ery of the President is a matter of grave
doubt. The fact that the. President is not
of robust health and the additional cir
cumstance of age, and consequent enfee
bioment cf constitution, are advanced as
etrong factors that may militate against
2rim In his battle for Ufa.
Dr. A. P. O'Brien, who was a surgeon
In the Philippines and is now Health Offi
cer of Ban Francisco, expressed his views
concerning President McKinley's chances
ior recovery as follows:
Chmshot wounds In the Etomach are at best
very serious affairs. If the victim Is a young
fnÂ»Tk of robust health, his chances for recovery
ere rood. Even under the most favorable con
dltlons there Is always danger of fatal results.
Xn the first place there is the shock to the
gyBtem consequent upon the necessity of lap
oratomy. which 'is often fatal to persons .. of
weak constitution.' Th?n again, there Is dan
eer of infection. Blood poisoning may follow
the escape of the. contents cf- the stomach
Into the abdominal cavity. I have seen young
soldiers ehot through the stomach In the
Philippines, all " of whom recovered. " But in
the President's case there Is the disadvantage
of ace, Â¦"* a more or less enfeebled constitu
tion. It Is impossible for anyone to say how
the President's wound may terminate in the
circumstances. Because no unfavorable symp
toms have thus far developed is no guarantee
that he will recover. Judging from the news
thus far received, my conviction Is that the
President Is in a most precarious condition,
end that his recovery Is doubtful.
Dr. J. M. Williamson, president of the
Board of Health, when asked to give his
views upon the probable outcome of Presi
dent McKinley's injuries, said:
From present Information, i I have no hesi
tancy In saying that the President will re
cover. Still, his chances are not as good as
they would be were he thirty years younger.
The President has not been In robust health,
and if serlcus complications ensue his system
might not be able to withstand the shock. His
danger does net He -In the, mere puncturing
cf the stomach. The question Is. what dam
age did the bullet do after passing through
the stomach. It might have Injured the nerve
g-anplia, or severed some blood vessels. In
which case there is danger from hemorrhage.
But the greatest danger is blood poisoning. If
that can be averted, the President will \cer
talnly recover. The prompt treatment of his
injuries greatly lessened the danger of a fatal
termination of the shooting. In addition to
I this, the President is being cared for 'by the
most skillful of surgeons, and this counts for
a great deal. Inasmuch as no unfavorable
eymptoHM have manifested themselves, I am
Inclined to the belief that the wound is not
as eerlous aa waa at first supposed. . -
Dr. Theodore Rethers, who as an army
eurgeon treated a number of men suffer
ing from gunshot wounds in the stomach
and intestines, said:
These stomach and Intestinal wounds are
cf tuch a varied nature that it "Is a hard
matter to foretell the result of the wound. In
flicted by. tie assassin's bullets. From what
I- have heard of .the , nature of the. wound,
without knowing exactly what part of the
/President's body the bullet penetrated, I
should say that his chances of recovery are :
film. I have known of a number of "people i
suffering from gun?hot "wounds in the Etom- j
, ach to recover, and quite a few persons have
been known to get. over perforations of, the

All Eager for the News.
Men and boys clustered about readers
of extra editions, and anxious Inquiries
were made of every one for anything
which Was not already public knowledge.
It was In clubs and hotels that the keenest
interest was manifested during the after
dinner hours. "When it was reported that
the President probably would recover and
there were no contradicting reports it
seemed to be taken for granted that the
event would not become a historical
tragedy.
At the big hotels the possible effect on
the financial situation was chiefly dis
cussed. All sorts of rumors were "afloat.
It was said J. P. Morgan had summoned
the chief bankers and capitalists on board
his yacht and wae holding a ways- and
means conference, and It was wildly
stated that the presidents of all the bis
banks were in session In the Metropolitan
Club. The truth is that Mr. Morgan,
after a conference with Jame3 R. Keene,
boarded his yacht and went 'to Great
Neck, L. I.
In the Fifth Avenue Hotel Senator
Platt in a corridor wa3 the center of a
gathering, who sat or stood about him,
Â¦who had sorrow written on their faces.
They listened with respect to the Senator
as he told cf the gentleness and klndnes3
of the man who had been stricken, and
said it was such cases as these that ju
tified lynching, and added that he regret
ted that the penalty in the State for the
crime, should the President not die, was
only ten years In the penitentiary.
At the Democratic Club and in the Hoff
man House, where were congregated men
whose political sympathies were not with
the chief executive, politics were forgot
ten In the sorrow which was evident. The
first resolutions of sorrow passed In this
city were by a joint meeting of the Dem
ocratic organization and tho Democratic
Tammany committee. â¢ f
Captain Titus. Chief of the Detective
Bureau, after conferring by telephone
with Sergeant Vallely, in charge of the

whom live in this city, by a son of Mrs.

mother and gently as possible acquainted
the two sisters of the President with the
terrible happening.
Tears were shed, but both ladies bora
up under the shock and showed much
bravery. They had both feared an at

their fears were at last awfully realized.
BUFFALO. Sept. 6.â Solemnity and sor
row were written upon the faces of thÂ©
diplomatic corps as they moved out of
the Niagara Hotel. The news reached
some of them on the exposition grounds,
others had gone 1 ' to their hotels on their
return with the President from a trip to
the falls and did not learn of the calamity
until late In the afternoon. Upon learning
it each one hurried to the Milburn house
to inquire as to the President's condition
aiid to express sorrow over the misfor

has found time to write many valuable
and interesting volumes. Among the more
notable of his works are: "The Naval

the other of Thontas H. Benton. and an
account of the Santiago campaign under
the title "The Rough Riders." Â¦Â¦Â¦..,.
His career, during the war added to his
fame and in- the succeeding State election
he was chosen Governor of New York
by an overwhelming majority. In the
performance of the duties of that office
he established his reputation as a states
man of the first rank. He was nominated
at the next Presidential election for the
office of Vice President by acclamation,
and during the campaign made a canvass
of. the West that will long be remembered
as one of the most brilliant in our annals.
Since then his official services have been
many. President Harrison appointed him
a member of the Civil Service Commission
In 1SS9 and he served as a member of
the board and Its president for six years.
In' 1895 he became president of the Board
of Police Commissioners In New York. In
1897 he was appointed by President Mc-
Kinley as Assistant Secretary of the Navy,
and In that office he served until the out

NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â This' city was
stunned when the news came that Presi

people on the, streets were feeling more
deeply than they had power to express.
As a consequence there was a dearth of
the demonstrations that accompanied the
receipt j of the news that President Gar
field had been shot or the wonderful out
break of wrath and deep sorrow which
was a feature of the assassination of
President Lincoln. The mass of ..the peo
ple was keenly interested and the bulletin
boards became centers of Â« interest for
thousands on Upper Broadway, j n Har
lem and at the newspaper offices in Park
row. The crowds which 'gathered about
these news centers were In some cases as
numerous as are the crowds on the oc
casion of national elections; but they
were not the cheering masses which the
New Yorker expects to see at such times

To-Day's News Letter.
In the seventh place we would direct your
attention to the fact that these men have re
fused Bteadlly to consult with any one con
cerning the present conditions of labor. The
whole city Â¦ Is affected by the struggle. Rep
resentatives of various interests have tried to
get the Employers' Association to a confer
ence. They have all been repulsed. .The great
employers of the East, men/ who could buy
out all the merchants of San Francisco and
not feel the expense, are not too proud to meet
and consult with those who are trying to end
a great strike. The executive committee, of
In the sixth place we .would direct your at
tention, to the fact that the Employers' Asso
ciation.' having, set the' town, on fire, is now
beseeching to stop the conflagration. You are
business men. What would you -think of a
company of business men who,- being engaged
in a transaction ' of the fire-t Importance, never
met to Impart counsel, , to receive reports, to
devise means to meet new conditions? â¢â¢ It is
a fact, and one of the saddest facts we can
conceive, that the Employers' Association, that
has taken on itself the responsibility of de
stroying the trade of San Francisco, Â¦ has never
yet held a meeting. A few men. and these by
no means distinguished for ability, for fore
sight, for prudence or for honor, have begun
this war and have carried It on without- once
deigning to consult those whose agents they
are supposed to be.
In the fourth place we would direct your at
tention to the fact that the Employers' Asso
ciation is a secret society. Its members are
ashamed to let the world know that they belong
to it. Tou are merchants and you know that
when a business man engages In a transaction
of which he is ashamed such transaction must
be despicable indeed. The Employers' Associa
tion belongs to the category of those aggrega
tions of village ruffians who in out of the -way
places come at midnight with masks on their
faces and weapons in their hands to terrify,'
to mutilate, to torture helpless men and feeble
women who have Incurred their displeasure, j
In the fifth place we would direct your at
tention to the fact that the Employers' Asso
ciation was organized for the purpose of ..car
rying out a scheme the responsibility for which
none of them has the courage to shoulder.
That ncheme is the destruction of trade unions.
We do not Intend to Insult your Intelligence
by proving the necessity of trade unionism.
Suffice it to say that "the . constitution and
laws authorize it"; the spirit of the country
claims It; the - prosperity of the people,
the very life of the nation, requires it.
Whatever the other Interests 'at stake that of
the right of popular association and combina
tion outranks them all, and this must be sus
tained even if those are to be sacrificed. Trades
unions must exist. This is the verdict of our
country. Against this verdict the Employers'
Association sets Itself up. You are men of
common sense and you can judge of the en
lightenment, the wisdom, the patriotism of the
Kmployers* Association, which, like an in
fatuated calf, stands between the rails facing
ths oncoming express train and thinks to stop
the progress of civilization by the Impact of
its bullet head.
In the third place we would direct your at
tention to the fact that the draymen were
forced to break their contract with us at the
bidding of an outside third party. Without any
provocation, without any justification, the Em
ployers' Association ordered the draymen to
violate the agreement between them and us,
which had worked so well. The draymen re
fused at first because they wished to conduct
their own business without outside interference,
and because they were perfectly satisfied with
our mutual relations. The Employers' Asso
ciation thereupon threatened to boycott our em
ployers and to ruin their business, and under
the stress of this threat the draymen violated
their contract with us by ordering us to per
form work which that contract expressly for
bade. WTien we refused we were locked out.
To the Members of the Merchants' Associa
tionâGentlemen: The board of directors of
your association has seen fit to address. a man
ifesto to you on.the condition of labor in San
Francisco. What were the precise circum
stances that moved them to that weighty act,
we do not know: but it is well understood that
you are not all satisfied with the management
of your association by its present regents and
a strong sense of opportunities neglected has
caused your board of directors to prefer this
account of Its stewardship. You -will pardon
us we hope, if we direct your attention to a
few fundamental facts which the daily devel
opments in this struggle are apt to obscure.
In the first place, we ; would direct your at
tention to the tact that the present condition
of labor' in San Francisco Is not a mere strike.
It has not been caused by the workingmen. It
is a lockout; it was caused by the employers.
Therefore if there be a disturbance of business,
if the lines of trade are falling from your
helpless hands, we are not the cause. The in
dictment cf injury to you and to our city lies
not acainst us but against vthose who without
any provocation whatsoever xrom us brought
on this struggle. ' .
In the second place we would direct your at
tention to the fact that there are three parties
in this struggle. It is not a contention between
the employers and the employed. If Â¦ we had
differed with, our employers or if our" employ
ers had differed with us, then public opinion
might apportion the blame. But there was ab
t>olutely no difference between the draymen and
the teamsters. An agreement existed between
them and us satisfactory to both sides. They
were willing to stand by their covenant, we
were willing to stand by ours. We had work
and they had business. There was not even a
ehadow of a cloud to disturb our good rela
tions.

quarters as a prisoner, led him to the foot
of Fourth street last evening and beat
him over the head with revolvers. Haney
has not been working at anything since
he arrived in the city. He says he was
sitting on a lumber pile reading a paper
when he was approached by several
teamsters. They told him to go along
with .them or they would kill him. After
keeping him at their headquarters all day
they led him to the Fourth-street bridge,
telling him they were going to ship him
on the steamer North Fork. Instead of
so doing they administered a severe beat
ing to him.

Wheeler's reply was: not 'to the point and
it asks for plain answers Â»to its' questions.
The; letter closes as follows:
Reply to President Wheeler.
After you have cleared the streets and kept
them clear you will make a report to me of
such saloons ns are used as headquarters for
the strikers. You have eight-hour watches, and
if you cannot obey the orders that are given
to you, which you are bound to do by your
oath of office, then it will be more manly for
jou to get out of tho -service altogether.-. ; v
I have seen officers standing on tho corners
in the midst of a crowd of strikers talking very
familiarly to them,- and 1 cannot understand
how an officer in the proper discharge of his
duties can do this, alter establishing a friend
ship with the violators of the law.
This must Â¦ not be permitted,- and whenever
any number * congregato in that way on the
public thoroughfare they must be dispersed.
Complaints have been made to me, and I have
verlned , them by . personal ; observation, that
large -crowds' of strikers are permitted to con
gregate on the streets south of Market, partic
ularly on-Xhlrd.and Fourth streets and in front
oi t-aloons" â¢which at times they make their
headquarters., - " l
Chief, of Police.; Sullivan disclaims the
alleged instructions given by him to the
police officers as published in the Exam
iner yesterday. In order to correct the
false impressions created by that publica
tion he nas given out the instructions he
delivered as follows:
DISCLAIMS ALLEGED SPEECH.
i Ex-Assistant District Altorney Hosmer
and P. F. Dunne, I who represent Witt
man, served Judge Cabaniss with the
temporary restraining order late In the
afternoon. Â¦ . . *
Wittman â¢ further asks the court to rÂ«
strain Judge Cabaniss absolutely from
proceeding further^ in the matter of the
battery charge against- him. Upon the
filing of Wittman's petition a temporary
restraining order was issued. Judge Sea
well will hear the case on the 10th inst.. Â¦
Captain of Police George W. Wittman
has petitioned the Superior Court for a
writ of prohibition to restrain' Police
Judge George H. Cabaniss from proceed
ing with the trial of the petitioner on the
charge of battery preferred against, him
by James Masse. Wittman, whose -trial
is- set for the 13th inst., takes exception
to the jury now being summoned for the
trial by Sheriff Lackmann. He contends
that Judge Cabaniss has no jurisdiction
to order the Sheriff to summon a Jury
and that such a jury would be illegal.
Secretary Lorenzo's course is not meet
ing with the approval of the members of
the Conciliation Committee, from whicn
he gets his authority. Joseph Rothschild,
chairman of the "committee, said, yester
day:
-The actions of Lorenzo in the past few
days have greatly offended the members
cf the committee. He drew up a basis of
settlement between the teamsters and
draymen without consulting the commit
tee and presented it to the parties at in
terest without the slightest authority.
The committee decided to put a period to
his cenduct, and his connection with the
ccn:mlttee is likely to be quite short
lived. . We do not desire the public to un
derstand that there was friction in our
committee and consequently made no pro
test against Lorenzo's conduct. But the
matter has reached that stage when
suirrrary action on the part of the com
mUtee was imperative. Any negotiations
for peace between the employers and
strikers which are now under way, and
in this committee is interested, will
be concluded by the committee as a body
and not by Mr. Lorenzo."
Mi. Rothschild stated further that sev
eral important matters bearing upon the
strike are under consideration and that
the prospects for an early settlement of
the dispute grow brighter every day.
Meanwhile Messrs. Michael and Renner
for the employers and Messrs. Casey and
Furuseth for the strikers assert that the
situation has not changed and no ground
exists for hope of early settlement.
The executive committee of the Dray
men's Association held two meetings, at
which terms of peace alleged to have been
proposed by the committee of one hun
dred of the Municipal Federation of Im
provement Clubs were considered, and an
other meeting for the same purpose will
be held at 11 o'clock this morning. The
terms involve the unconditional return of
the strikers to work, but a recognition of
the Brotherhood of Teamsters in matters
affecting hours and wages is conceded by
the employers. Messrs. Lorenzo and
Greensfelder are hopeful that the Dray
men's Association will approve the terms,
in which case the proposal will" be sub
mitted to the Brotherhood of Teamsters.
The union's approval of the terms is re
garded as a foregone conclusion.
LITTLE of Importance developed
yesterday In tho strike situation,
although rumors remained cur
rent that the prospects of settle
ment were brightening. The Su
pervisors' Conciliation Committee secured
no conference with an Employers' Asso
ciation committee, and the draymen and
teamsters are apparently no nearer agree
ment.

SAN, JOSE, Sept. 6.â The. attempted as
sassination of President McKinley put a
temporary damper on the enthusiasm
over the Native Sons' celebration this aft
ernoon 1 and for a . time Â¦ it was feared It
would have,, to be '.abandoned. . This even
ing the general committee of the celebra
tion held a meeting to consider the ques^
tibri. 'The ' committees in San Francisco,
Oakland,' Alameda, Santa Cruz and.else
where were communicated Â¦with and the
general expression was that President
McKInley's condition was so favorable
that It did. not. warrant any change In the
Admission day plans. This was the opin

Special .Dispatch to The Call.
Recalling Persinger's warning, the offi
cers set out in pursuit of Fleming. He
was captured near Missoula. On the trial
the circumstantial evidence showed thai
Fleming had concealed himself in another
room of the Dotson house and, through a
hole in the partition, had fired the fiial
shot.
Early in January of this year Fleming
was released from prison. On February
15 he was foen at Washington Gulch. On
February 20 the dead body of Captain
poteen was found in his cabjn witli a
bullet wound in his head.
The crime for which Fleming suffered
the death penalty is one of the most re
markable In the history cf criminology,
involving a most revolting and diabolical
conspiracy. On August 8, 1S!>9. Eugene
Cullinane. an aged resident of Washing
ton Oulch. a remote settlement In Powell
county, was found murdered. For this
crime Clinton Dotson, Charles Oliver Ben
son and Ellis Persinger were tried aud
convicted. Dorson was sentenced to life
imprisonment and Benson, who made a
partial confession, and Persinger were
sentenced to ten years.
Last January Persinger Informed War
den Conley of the State prison that Dot
son and a. convict passing under tho
assumed name of James McArthur, but
whose real name was James Fleming, had
conspired to bring about the death of
Captain Oliver Dotson. Clinton Dotson's
father, an old man living in Washington
Guich also. The plot was that Fleming,
whose term was soon to expire, was to go
to Washington Gulch, kill Captain Dot
son, leave a forged confession and will
and arrange the surroundings in such a
way as to lead to the theory of suicide.
So wild vas this plot that the prison
oflicials paid no attention to it.
McArthur kept his nerve to the last anrt
walked to the sallows"Vithout a sign of
weakness. After taking his place on the
;>Iatform he was given permission to make
a statement. Facing <ne spectators, he
launched Into a torrent of abuse of the
men who had been instrumental in send
:ng him to his death and declared again
and again that he was an Innocent man.
He rambled 'on for several minutes an<l
finally the Sheriff, seeing there was no
chance to stop him. gave the signal for
the trap to be sprung. The drop fell at
10:16, and McArthur was pronounced dead
seven minutes later.

terms will be submitted to the teamsters for their approval. Â¦ .

In receiving the Sheriff of London the other day
the spokesman of the New York Board of Aldermen
extended what he called "the freedom of the best
governed city in the world"; so it seems the habit
of greeting strangers with gold bricks has become so
settled in New York that they use it even in official
addresses.
Warming up to his theme Mr. Moore went on to
say: "I am going to find* a primitive people, in place
of a sophisticatedâ I may say a' decadent â people. I
am going in search of air that I can breathe without
choking. The first concern of every man is the moral
atmosphere in which he lives. Some people 'are T quite

Mr. Moore is a master of the art of phrase making,
being in that respect fully equal to Oscar Wilde and
not unworthy of comparison with Sheridan himself.
He has exhibited that faculty in announcing his de
termination to leave London. To an interviewer he
said: "I must escape from the 'Brixton' empire,"
and when the interviewer balked at the word Mr.
Moore added:- "This empire of vulgarity, and greed,
and materialism, and hypocrisy, that is crawling
round the whole world, throttling other races and
nationalities â all for their own good, of course!â and
reducing everything to one machine-made Brixton
pattern." _- :-,-v6--:. ' -â¢ - : 'Â¦-â¢ â¢'â â¢ 'Â¦Â£-.Â£-â¢
MR. GEORGE MOORE, the Irish novelist,
who Has achieved considerable success in
several' of his .works, has recently announced
an intention to leave London and to abandon any
further effort at depicting London or English life.
He will hereafter reside mainly in Ireland and will
write of the Irish people. As Mr. Moore is not a
genius of first or even second class, nor an author
of any great popularity, this decision 'will not mean
much to the" world of letters, but it is significant of
the growing feeling on the part of the Irish for a
distinctive literature as well as a separate Parliament.
* ; Inspired by . that resolution Mr. Moore ' may yet
achieve greater things than his critics have deemed
possible for him. The Brixton empire loses nothing
that it values by his departure, but he may^ gain much.
InUhe meantime the world has to thank him for a
good phrase added to the talk of the day.
sire an atmosphere in which tenderness,, and pity for
humanity, and the cultivation, of ideas, count for
more than so-called material advantages." '
' Of the irate author's coming and of his going the
busy world of London will take no more note than
would "the sea's self, a pebble cast," but all the same
Mr. Moore, has fixed a descriptive phrase upon the
empire that wilkbe approved by a good many people.
It is a Brixton empire fighting for greed and gain
and not for glory or for law in South Africa, and' it
is that fact which has impressed the; novelist and
rendered him discontented with 'any" further life in
London. As he himself said: "It is only of late, when
I have 'seen. how insatiate imperialism is degrading
the English race, that I have recognized how all art,
all morality, all spiritual life is rooted in nationality.'
I am going so far as in me lies to help Ireland to
recover; her. own language and save her. soul."

The Pacific remarked a few weeks ago
that it seemed good, to see Governor Gajre
in with the bishops at the opening of the
Epworth League Convention, and that it
would in all probability be a good thing
for the State If he could tabernacle in so
excellent company. Governor Gagewns
up on the mountain top of high thought
that day and said some good things in way
of welcome to the assembled Leaguers.
But, alas! how- much easier it is to preach
than. to practice, to counsel other people
to, right action and noble endeavor
than to ; tent. oneself on the field of such
action,, ready always to battle for , that
Â¦which Is in the best interests of humanity.
Governor Gage had not been long separ
ated from that exalted position taken by
him when he . addressed - the Epworth
League before he lowered his standard
considerably. When, a few days ago, lie
.removed from the office of superintendo.it
of the Home for Feeble-minded Children
a man who for fifteen years has filled that
position In a highly, satisfactory manner,
to make room for a protege of his and a
chronic office-seeker, he .failed by a lonsf
distance to measure up to the Impression
made by his words that day when he sat
with the .venerable "bishops, and he fell
far, short also of what the, people of Cali-.
fornia, have , reason; to expect in this day
from a man who occupies the'guberna
torial chair. On all sides the members of
his own party are condemning him for tho
removal of Dr. Osborne i and the appoint-^
ing. of Dr. Lawlor. Leading party; papers
declare it to be a crime against the most
helpless and innocent of mankind. Unless
the Governor, can give for j his action some
reason | not now - known : to the public/ he

a very large number of the people whom

Of course no one expects a victory for the Repub

the Democratic majorities, elect a number of their
candidates and infuse a new and better life into Vir
ginia politics. It is said a large number of young Vir
ginians have become allied with Republicanism in the
contest and will help vigorously in making the fight
sgainst the old leaders. At any rate, it is not going
to be a walkover for ( the Democrats, and that is
something of a benefit to a State where for so many
j'ears Democracy has been undisturbed by any strong
movement for improvement and progress.
Another source of cheer is the evidence of divisions
of sentiment among the Democratic members of the
constitutional convention and the growing popular
distrust of that body. Some of the leaders of the con
vention have been so alarmed by the drift of popular
sentiment they have seriously proposed that the con
vention declare the new constitution to be the su
preme law of Virginia without submitting it to the
popular vote 'for ratification. It is believed that if
the constitution be submitted the voters will divide
upon the issue and that a good many of those who
vote against it will also vote against the party that
framed it, while on the other hand, if it be not sub
mitted, many citizens will vote for Republican can
didates to show their condemnation of that method
of forcing a constitution upon the people.
The chief cause of revived Republican activity in
Virginia is doubtless the satisfaction of the masses of
the people with the Republican administration of na
tional affairs and their discontent with Democratic
administration in the State. Prosperity has inclined
many an intelligent Virginian to support the party
of prosperit3% while a deep disgust with Bryanism
has strengthened the inclination. Moreover, there
has been a bitter fight among the Democratic fac
tions of the State, and it is said the Republican ora
tors during the campaign will need no stronger argu
ments against the State Democratic machine than has
been furnished by Democrats themselves.
WITH hopes born' of a variety of reasons the
Republicans of Virginia have entered this
year upon an active campaign. Their can
didate- iox Governor, Colonel Hoge, is said to be a
"strong man and a good debater. The fashion of
joint debates has always been popular in the South,
and the Republicans are trying to arrange for such
campaigning in this instance, feeling confident that
their opponents cannot successfully meet the argu
ments that Republican speakers are prepared to pre
sent to the people.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
PERSONAL MENTION.
THE finding of the strange giraffe-like animal 5n the
d-warf inhabited forests of Central Africa is on.-Â» of the
most astonishing discoveries of modem times, says the
London Sphere. New varieties of well-known animals are
. from time to time brought home by travelers, but the
discovery of a hitherto unknown animal, forming a new genus
or family, is a rare occurrence and naturally has created a
great amount of Interest in the zoological world. Though utter
ly unknown as a living animal until flurlng the past few years,
the existence of such a beast was hinted at by some fossil
bones dug from the mlocene deposits of ancient Greece, In which
they had lain hidden for thousands of years. This prehistoric
giraffe-like animal was larger than the giraffe, but his shorter
neck and legs agree with those of the newly discovered ani
mal in a way which adds further romance to the discovery.
Nor will his detractors and enemies who have led to this attempt to undo him be for
gotten by our people, who will not be deceived by sniveling hypocrisy and - pretended
solicitude about a crime that they have suggested. It is a time for sorrow and resent
ment.
So the pure and primitive idea that our Government would never be the scene ,tjf
such crimes must be abandoned. It was" entertained before such, creatures were spawned
as those who make a newspaper the inspiration of crime and promoter of assassination.
Upon this city still lies the genial spell of the President's presence. The school chil
dren cherish his counsel toward wisdom and happiness and all men feel more wholesome
as their lives can show the influence of his example. In no other part of the republic
will more prayers go up for his survival of the sliots that smote him. Not elsewhere
will deeper indignatiorTbe felt toward his assassin and the dastards whose miscreant
journalism nerved his hand. San Francisco sits in thought by the sufferer's pillow,
soothes his pain and offers an oblation from pity's sweet fountain that is balm' intended
for his wounds; â¢' . â¢.
But one heart was black with murder and had become a plexus to. absorb all the
poison emitted against the President by enemies whqjnave pursued him beyond-all lim
its heretofore permitted in American politics. The widespread labor strikes have gen
erated an atmosphere of lawlessness in which such papers as the Examiner, and "especial
ly the Examiner, have enlarged the elements that lead to murder. That paper by coarse
cartoons has persistently pictured the President as the promoter of whatever could be
represented as inimical to the public welfare. Sordid discontent in a time of general pros
perity has been encouraged to raise its hand against the law, and a wave of disorder has
swept from ocean to ocean like the pulse of the tides. President McKinley could not be a
candidate for another term. His first was a time of test and trial, of novel responsibilities
and crushing anxieties which he bore with philosophy. After his second and last term
began there was no possible partisan reason justified by good sense or fair play for con
tinuing vulgar and slanderous attacks upon him. But the Hearst papers ha,ve not, ceased
to attack him in precisely such a way as to incite their pupil and ally to the murder which
he has attempted. Those papers are morally accessories before the fact* to the crime
that has appalled the world. Their daily attitude of brutal falsehood and disrespect
has been all the license required by the anarchist murderer who finds his justification in
the lying that they indulge about economic conditions and the responsibility for them.
When the people make their knowledge of him the subject of reflection and consider
the scene in the midst of which the assassin attacked him, they may well mourn. Around
him were the evidences of the high progress and prosperity of the Western hemisphere,
and upon it all the glow and sheen of popular contentment and happiness. His coun
try, the leader in that stately procession of nations that stretches from Hudson Bay to
Cape Horn, holds her place not by the sword but by the implements and arts of peace
which he had labored always to make more effective in the hands of the people. There
was everything to inspire happiness, good will and friendship toward him, and to put
thankfulness into every heart.
"Expositions are the timekeepers of progress. They record, the world's advance
ment. They stimulate the energy, enterprise and intellect of the people and quicken
human genius. They go into the home. They broaden and brighten the daily life of
the people. They open mighty storehouses of information to the student. Every expo
sition, great or small, has helped to some onward step. N Comparison of ideas is always
educational, and as such instructs the brain and hand of man. Friendly rivalry follows,
which is the spur to industrial improvement, the inspiration to use future invention and
to high endeavor in all departments of human activity. It exacts a study of the wants,
comforts and even the whims of the people and recognizes the efficacy of high quality
and new prices to win their favor."
His oratory has always a marked grace and graciousness, and his 'statement is always
lucid, but he never excelled this sentence in that exposition address, in which the scene
around him was given its true significance, and its highest purpose was declared -to be
its influence on the home.
First a word about the victim of this imported and murderous fiend. President McKin
ley has never been, willing to distrust the people, even to the extent of thinking of his per
sonal safety. The most amiable, thoughtful and approachable of men, and throughout his
career the sincere well wisher of his countrymen, his friendly personality, frankness and
sympathetic attitude toward all humanity should have made him safe in any American
community. He had a distinct individuality among our public men. His views of na
tional policy rested upon an original basis, and though the policies were old and baitle
scarred in many a political contest, he gave them new life for new reasons. His career
has been typically American and his inspiration came from his own experiences. His eye
saw through all the pomp and circumstance of government back, and back to. the ultimate
purpose of government, the fireside welfare of the people. Therefore in all his public ut
terances we find him thinking of the home, the shelter of the family, and of the fire on
its hearth, the food on its table and the happiness of its occupants. Only the day be
fore the bullet of the imported devil laid him low, in his speech at the Buffalo Exposi
tion his theme was the home, the hearts therein bound together in affection, and the
means by which it could stand as the asylum of all gentleness. â¢
But now we are called to blush for a crime that must cause the most serious reflec
tions that Americans can indulge. As far as known at this writing the assassin of Presi
dent McKinley is of that class of reptiles who sit upon a pinnacle that is built for them
out of the v misleading, misguiding and misteaching of men.
The assassin has for a third time turned the weapons of death against Presidents of
the republic. In the cases of Lincoln and Garfield the crime was different . in its psy
chology from the murderous attempt made yesterday on President McKinley, which has
plunged the nation into mourning. In the first two attacks the immediate personal ele
ment of revenge was apparent. Booth killed Lincoln through a supposed devotion to a
lost cause, and by that act robbed that cause of a halo of romance far brighter than any
which the genius of history will give it. Guiteau, a wretched monomaniac and paranoiac,
inflated his small personality to the stature of an historic murderer and died as he had
lived, a purposeless, blattering, worthless " creature, who had no followers and assassin
ated with no reason that cbuld dignify even murder.
THE old idea honestly entertained in the early days of the republic, that here the
bloody passions of men would not be turned against the administrators of a gov
ernment so admirably adapted to preserve the rights of man and procure his hap
piness, must be regretfully abandoned.

WAECOTT IS ON HIS "
WAY TO THIS CITY
SACRAMENTO.
In the first Inning the Senators shot
Devereaux across the plate. Going to first
on a hit, stealing second and reaching
third on McLaughlin'B out, he scored on
Doyle's hit through Babbitt.
The game was fast and on the Oakland
Fide replete with sharp, sure fielding. Bab
bitt at third and Eagan on the initial bag
dividing the honors.
Hodson. who was on the slab for the
Dudes, proved too enigmatical a subject
for the Senatorial stickers to handle.
Three hits were all that the score shows
against him.. The score:
With two men In the cemetery Babbitt
came up for s hit. scoring Immediately
after on a two-base hit by Streib. who in
turn crossed tfce rubber on-Eagan's sin
gle. Then came Drennan with another
two-bagger, and Eagan added the third
run to the list. Mohler was the third to
die. He was introduced yesterday by
Ewing and gives promise of "making
good." \ . . . .
McNeely made his first appearance, on
the Recreation grounds yesterday,
with the exception of a single . inning,
when the Dudes kept playing around the
bases, he pitched very good ball. The
third read the knell to Sacramento's
hopes of victory. Â¦

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 6.â Beyond ques
tion the largest crowd of the meet attend
ed the racing at Agricultural Park to-day..
The merriment of the gay throng was
partially hushed when the attempt on the
life of the President was made known
and the flags "were all half-masted when'
it was reported that the nation's head
had passed away. Later when a bulletin
was posted that President McKinley was
still alive It was hailed with .great ap
1 plause from the stand.
- All day long the traveling men were
strongly In evidence, it being Drummers',
i day. Irrepressible Wilbur >Knapp was
present, leading more than two score of
the "knights." They took possession of
the grounds in the forenoon and kept
those assembled in gay spirits with a
series of races.
Ole Folks, the unique colored turf char
acter, known from Brighton Beach, where
he used to buck and wlnÂ£ for the edifica
tion of the grand stand, to Willows, Gal.,
where he "new the bank roll" running a
crap game, Is on the ground. Folks. Is
minus one bptic, which- he says 'was
kicked out by a game chicken while peek
ing into a hencoop one frosty New Year's
evening in Southern Kansas. After per
using the price Folks concluded a trip to
the springs would benefit the layers' oi
odds and refuses to unload his coin,
which got here on- the brakebeam of a
through freight.
Almonada, a bay horse by Eros, driven
by H. Delaney, captured the 2:20 trot
after a tame contest. Thomas R, handled
by Farmer "Buncn, was the pick of the
smart ones, but he went lame after tak
ing the second heat, and Almonada, with
the flrst to his creait, won tne third and
lourth heats.
Five started in the Drummers' race. It
evoked very little interest, finally going
to Abdlne, driven by H. A. Bell.
In the nve funonjj scramble for maiden
two-year-olds Quaura, a three to one
chance, left that oasa with* flying colors.
Tne nily with Logue up took the lead in
the run home, beating i>ulette and Redan
half a dozen lengths in 1:01%. The latter
was played down from twos to 6 to 6 fa
voritism. Crub Russell on Yankee Dame
grew fatigued at the stretch turn or the
ally might have won.
J. Ransch seems unable to get astride a
winner. He had the leg up on Merops,
even money favorite for the mile and *.
sixteenth run, and the gelding couldn't
scare up a gallop. Limber Jim made the
running to tne paddock, where Russell on
: the C to 5 second choice Cromwell got up,
j winning by two lengths. Limber Jim took
the piece from Whaleback by a head. El
I Mido fell seventy yards from the wire,
McCarthy escaping with a shaking up.
The second, batcn of maiden two-year
olds were a nondescript lot. Dawson, witn
Jimmy Logue up and 7 to 10 in the ring,
shook off Senator Bruce and in a drive
led out Wandering Boy a neck. Show
honors went to Senator Bruce. Lost
Charley Ross neglected to use his dumb
bells this morning, and Coming Event, a
3 to -2 second choice, took the concluding
three-quarter sprint very .cleverly. The
general public plunged heavily on Can
deros, the Jennings entry, which was
played down to- 7 to 10 favoritism. . The:
latter galloped into the stretch and -it i
looked all â¢ over, when Coming Event i
slipped along, 'defeating- the good thing a

...The. name of Nunez, the pilot, la on Ad
miral Schley's list. He was put aboard
the Brooklyn by Captain Sigs'bee to serve
as a pilot, and he it was who reported to
Admiral Schiey that it was impossible for
the Spanish squadron to enter Santiago
harbor without tugs, on account of the
crookedness of the channel. Among tho
civilians to be called are several news
paper men who -served as correspondents
during the West Indian campaign.
"Admiral Barker, who was a member of
the War Board during the Spanish-Amer
ican war, arrived here to-day. He is ona
of the witnesses on Admiral Schley's list,
which leads to the belief that the evidence
may go into circumstances before the war
began and when the West Indian cam
paign was planned. â¢ '
Admiral Schiey and his counsel to-day
began holding sessions with the witnesses
they will call. Those heard to-day were
Admirals Watson and Barker. The sit
tings were private and the character of
the evidence was not disclosed.- Admiral
Watson was at Guantanamo on. the day
of the battle of Santiago.
. Judge Advocate General Lemly has de
cided, so far a3 the. civilian witnesses
whose names appear on the list are con
cerned, that he has no power under the
law to summon themMn advance of the
meeting of the court, that body alone be
ing competent to issue a formal sum
mons having legal force. Captain Lemly
to-day " issued i "notices" to each of 'the
civilians named, requesting them to be
present in Washington at the opening day
of the court next Thursday. Â¦ .â¢. â¢
WASHINGTON, Sept. .6.â The Navy De
partment received a letter from Admiral
Schiey to-day containing a< list of wit
nesses he desires to have brought here
and adding a request that they be sum
moned.' Acting Secretary Hackett has ex
pressed a willingness to have the wit
nesses brought here at once. Arrange
ments have been made to arrange techni
cal details, so that they may get here
promptly. . .
HAVANA, Sept. 6.â Adjutant General. Wash-
Ingt6n: Mayor and City Council of Havana
have cabled expressing sorrow and solicitude
for the President? and desire that his family
be advised of these exDresalons,
SCOTT, Adjutant General.
It was somewhat gratifying to the offi
cials here that the very" first expressions
of official sympathy should come from the
island of Cuba in the shape of the follow
ing telegram received at the War Depart
ment at 7:45 p.'m.: .
The other diplomatic representative in
Washington was Senor Herran, repre
senting the Government of the United
States of Colombia. He 'also was greatly
distressed ar.d affirmed ''that his whole
country would sympathize with the Presi
dent in this moment of pain. He could not
understand," he said, why such a benevo
lent character as President McKinley
should be. thus assaulted by one of the
people, and he declared that it was time
that the anarchists should be suppressed.
In conclusion, almost Â¦with tears, he ex
pressed the hope that the President would
speedily recover from his terrible injury.
Admiral Dewey arrived in Washington
early in the afternoon. He proceeded at
once to his suburban home and was oc
cupied with the details of the approaching
Schiey court of inquiry, when the news
reached him by telephone. He at once
sought all the particulars that were avail
able and placed himself In readiness for
any service that might be required of
him, informing Acting Secretary Hackett
of that fact. The admiral found himself
unable to express his feelings at the news
and all that could be extracted from him
was that he was plunged in grief too deep
for utterance at this time. He said that
he could not now express an opinion as
to the effect that the calamity might have
on the court of inquiry or even whether It
would result in the postponement of the
approaching sitting.
Owing to the absence of many of
the diplomatic corps at Buffalo and
at the various summer resorts, there
were only two representatives of this
body of rank in Washington to-day.
Minister Wu was one of these, and when
seen to-night he was a picture of distress.
He realized keenly the tremendous in
debtedness of China, to President McKin
ley's kindly impulses in her great trials
in the last year and was shocked vthat the
great calamity had befallen him: .He Bald
he could conceive of no sort of motive for
such an inexcusable deed as that of Nle
man. and he was severe in his denuncia
tion of anarchists. He asked, why they
were permitted to hatch such plots as this
in a republic, where the people could
readily change their President If they
were in the slightest degree dissatisfied
with his' official conduct or his private
personality.
Assistant Secretary Ailes of the Treas
ury Department received a message to
night from Secretary Gage at Chicago
stating that he was about to leave at once
for Buffalo, where he will arrive to-mor
row.
The conference decided that there was
little more . that- the War Department
could undertake at this time. Surgeon
General Van Reypen of 'the navy, who
came down to the Navy Department,
called at General Gillespie's office and,
discussing' the case from a medical point
of view, took occasion to mention Dr.
Nicholas Senn of Chicago as an expert of
high grade in such cases of injury, and
the suggestion was promptly telegraphed
to Buffalo that his services be secured.
General Brooke . has at Buffalo at his
disposal a company of coast artillery sta
tioned in the Exposition grounds, a com
pany "of. the' Fifteenth Infantry, also sta
tioned at Fort Porter, within the limits of
he Exposition preserves, and other troops
at Fort Niagara. . Â¦
â¢ WASHINGTON, Sept. 6.â General Git
lespie telegraphed 7 Vice President Roose
velt at Burlington,. Vt.? and it is presumed
that it was his message that started the
Vice President, in' haste to: Buffalo. Dur
ing the early evening a conference was
held at the -War Department of such of
the department arrny officers as could be
gathered at such short notice by General
Gillespie. He informed them that he-com
municated with General Brooke, at.Gov
ernor's Island, and that the general had
replied that h9 would start immediately
for Buffalo, where he will arrive in the
morning, to take personal charge of all
arrangements for gua'rding the Presiden
tial household. 'Meanwhile he had directed
that the troops .which had been placed on
guard around the' hospital in the Exposi
tion grounds bo transferred to the Mil
burn home, where th<v President lies, to
serve as a guard and keep back the pub
lic and preserve quiet. ' â¢

Here is a heartrending tale. A year
ago a demoiselle in Paris -won first prize
in a much-heralded beauty contest. A
dressmaker, scenting: advertisement, paicl
the lady. 30,000 francs a year to wear his
costumes exclusively. A rival dress
maker, with envy In fcls heart, offered
her another salary on condition that she
should circulate the statement that, while
she wore the gowns of the first, it 'was
only for the sake of the salary, and ,
down., deep In her soul she preferred the 1 /
gowns of the second. She succumbed tol\
thÂ« - temptation, and now\ there is a law-v
ault on and she bids fair to get neither
payment.â New York Press.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Review of Trade to-morrow will say: A holi
day reduced the volume of legitimate business.
while speculative operations were seriously, cur
tailed by the general closing of exchanges
from Friday, af ternoon ;' to Tuesday .morning.
In the movement of merchandise and in many
manufacturing lines there has been efTort to
make up the loss by working- ' overtime, but
the week's record will fall behind those im
mediately preceding. Actual sales of many
iron and steel products are reckoned at ma
terial advances and the tone throughout has
been hardened by vigorous demand. Placing
of sample orders for spring footwear Is of such
character, as to indicate a healthy market and
some Jobbers are so anxious for early delivery
that contracts are being closed now. Despite
that acti\'ity in the market for cotton Roods
and placing of Government contracts the staple
shows no great strength. Although unsettled
in. tone little alteration occurred in the prin
cipal cereals. Trading was restricted and there
was an apparent declination to assume' an
aggressive stand on either side of the market.
Commercial failures during â¢ the ' month of
August were 803 In number and $9,468,866 in
amount of liabilities. â¢ Compared with the same
month last year the statement is ' most satis
factory, as failures were then only 735 in num
ber and $7,323,903 in amount.

NEW YORK. Sept. 6. â Professional operators
who were alone concerned in yesterday's mar
ket for stocks had even more difficulty to-day
to induce any movement of pricee and the
direction of the movement was also more shift
ing and uncertain. The volume of tmsineea
fell back to about the lowest of the year for
a full day's trading. The uncertainty of the
money outlook prompted the restriction of out
lay in etocks, while the strength of the gen
eral situation continues equally efficacious in
deterring holders from selling. The usual
Â¦weekly forecast of the weekly changes of the
caeh reserves of the bank which is compiled
from statement* furnished by the banks them
selves was awaited with unusual interest to
day. The market was inclined to rally on. the
bank statement and on the absence of a flurry
in the call money market which was expected
on account of the special demand usual on
Friday. The rtee in New York exchange at
Chicago to 40c discount, compared, with 60c
discount earlier in the week. Indicated relaxed
pressure for 'funde. The high point touched
for call loans was<% per cent.- and it was only
momentarily held. There was a very small
business in railroad bonds. The price move
ments were unimportant. Total sales. $68o 000
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

American shares orened dull, but were soon
fractionally above parity. Norfolk and West
ern, Erie' and Atchison were the favorites.
New York's response to the better tone caused
a steady finish. Speculation In this department
has been somewhat checked by a feeling of
nervousness over the showing; to be made by

NEW YORK, Sept.' 6.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review will say to-morrow: As the Stock
Exchange was closed Saturday until -Monday,
which was a legal holiday. Wall street had a
short week. When business was resumed on
Tuesday there was a decided change in senti
ment, due to the fact that last week's bank
statement was more unfavorable than had been
anticipated. ! The loss of $6,000,000 in reserve
by the banks and the reduction of surplus re
serves to about $11,900,000 created more or less
apprehension regarding the money market,
which was increased by the reduction. In the
supply . of time money and the hardening of
call loan rates, which advanced to 3% per cent.
The idea found expression that if the experi
ence of two years ago was repeated and the
bank reserves were further depleted exceed
ingly firm rates for money might result and
the stock market receive a decided , setback.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS
CHICAGO. Sept.. 6. âWheat. started off rather
firm on improved cables and cool, wet weather
.throughout the Northwest; but sold oft , later
and closed' weak in sympathy ' with other
grains. Cables came discouraged at the out
set ,and unloading was on . a large, scale. De
cember opened unchanged to %c higher at
71%c, but the early strength ..was short lived
and prices continued to sag during the day.
The close was %c lower at-71%c or %c above
the low figure for the day.
Corn'opened excited and: a shade. higher with
a 'good general demand and only moderate
offerings. Low temperatures in the extreme
Northwest and predictions of frost in Minne
sota and the Dakotas . caused some anxiety to
shorts early. Covering by shorts rallied prices
somewhat, but toward the close there was an
other decline to 57%c Final figures were V4c
lower 9t 57%c.
Commission houses were good buyers of oats
early j and the market was inclined to follow
corn. Â¦ The latter part of thÂ« session was dull*
and featureless. December dosed Vio lower at
the low point. " .
Although hogs werÂ« again Bold at higher
prices, provisions on the' whole wore Quiet ana
price* about unchanged. January pork cloeed
2tfc higher, lard 7V4c higher and ribs 2V4@5o
higher. . ;â¢ ; , '

CORNâ Chicago was active and firm. Prices
were higher at the opening, but subsequently
declined. The advance was caused by ru
mored bullish State reports and predictions of
a frost within three days in the Northwest,
which would greatly damage Corn In the north
ern tier of the Â¦ Corn belt States. It was very
cold in the. extreme north, almost freezing In
Manitoba and snowing at Helena. The advance
was checked, however, by Increasing quan
tities of old Corn being discovered in farmers'
hands j throughout the West, and these farm
reserves are now estimated at about 300,000,000
bushels. . , . , . s

AVhlle the committee on platform was

some minor matters were being considered
by the convention. Chairman Parry came
out on the stage followed by the members
of the committee, and demanded to know
what was before the convention. Consid
erable confusion followed, but peace was
finally restored and" a recess taken. ,
The platform was finally read, each sec
tion being -applauded. It was decided to
read it section by section, but before this
was done William Chalmers of Carpenters'
Union No. 483 presented a minority re
port. A question arose as to the nature
of the report and' Chalmers was refused
a hearing. Chalmers insisted on his rights
as a delegate and renewed his demand.
After untangling the parliamentary maze
into which the convention had Â¦ fallen,
Chalmers was given the opportunity ho
sought.
He read the platform adopted by the
Socialist party, slightly ; altered to nt the
present purpose, but the convention re
fused to accept it. and the minority report
was rejected. After the majority report

CHICAGO, Sept. Câ Six men were placed
under arrest In this city to-night on the
charge of having been implicated in the
plot to assassinate President McKinley.
The men were all found In one house, at
the corner of St. Johns place and Carroll
avenue, on the west side of the city. The
. arrests were made en information of the
# police officials of Buffalo, who said that
\ "he men were members of a society to
which, the assailant of the President be
longed, and that they had knowledge of
the plot.
The police have not yet given out the
names of the men taken Into custody, but
one cf them is known to be Abraham
Isekk, president of an organization which
bears the name of the Free Society. He
was formerly editor of a paper of an
archistic principles, which bore the name
of The Firebrand. The information re
ceived by the local police from Buffalo is
to the effect that the plot to kill the
President was originated among the mem
ber? of the Free Society and that the
Buffalo prisoner was chosen by lot to
commit the crime.
There were five men and three women
in the place where the arrests were made,
and a^seared to be discussing some se
rious matter. They were so completely
surprised by the invasion of the police
that they had no time to make any re
sistance. Isekk is supposed by the police
to have been the leader of the men assem
bled, but when he was questioned at the
house he refused to make any statement.
On the way from the house, to the pa
trol wsgon one of the prisoners cursed
the officers and declared that he was an
anarchist and was proud of it.
The three women in the house, Isskk's
wife and daughter and a woman visitor,
Vv.ere subsequently arrested. The building
' >i which the raid was made is a two-story
anc! basement stone front structure in the
factory district. On the first floor is sit
uated Isckk's printing office, in which
cuts of leading anarchists were found.
The windows were decorated with lith
ographs of leading anarchists and numer-.
ous. publications denouncing the present
form^of government and the judges who
had issued injunctions against^ the strik
ers were found.
All the men arrested with Isekk were
employes of the paper. The arrests were
made by Chief of Detectives Colleran, as
sisted by three of his officers. Captain
Colieran said, after taking the men to the
Central police station for examination,
that he had arrested them upon informa
tion from Buffalo, but what the nature of
Ills information might be he declined to
Â»ay. He would not admit that he had re
reived any intimation that the assailant
of the President, had made a confession
implicating in any way the men arrested
here. A quite general Impression outside
the office of Captain Colleran is that there
was no special reason for arresting the
men eave for the general character of
their teachings and writings.
Oscar Neebe. one of the anarchists con
victed of complicity "In the Haymarkst

Besides George Foster. Samuel Ireland
of the Rochester division and A. L. Gal
lagher of Chicago were assigned as body
guards, their instructions being to keep
juÂ£.t behind the President. It was in Gal
lagher's arms that the President fell when
he was stricken by the assassin's bullet.
There was not a mishap or accident to
the President from the time he left the
fapital until he returned, and- at every
railroad station or crossing where crowds
gathered to meet the distinguished guests
there were expressions of admiration for
his stalwart six-footed guard, whose coun
tenance fairly beamed with good nature.
During the recent sojourn of President
and Mrp. McKinley at their Canton resi
dence Foster was on duty, and when the
party left for the Buffalo Exposition he
was at the President's elbow as usual.
Arrangements had been made by the
secret service officials to take particular
pains at the forthcoming Grand Army en
<Â¦ -sTnoment at Cleveland, which President
McKinley v.-as expected io attend, but ad
ditional safeg-uards were thrown around
him at Buffalo.
Any one who has felt the erlp of "BlÂ£
George" Foster knows that he can carry
out eucli an order to the letter. On tours
the President has made about the coun
ttj- Foster has always accompanied him
snd stood at his elbow to keep off curious
citizens.
Subsequently Foster became identified
with the United States secret service and
quickly became an expert in handling and
detecting counterfeit silver money. When
President McKinley was Installed at the
"White House Foster was detailed to at
tend the President whenever there was
to be an unusually large crowd at the
executive mansion. His Instructions were
to keep his eyes open for any suspicious
looking characters and in case of doubt
as to any caller to see that he was quletiy
but firmly dealt with. ,

New unions were admitted as follows:

A number cf other delegates explained
the plan in various ways, and at the re
quest of others Chairman Millmore told
what he knew about it.
Delegate Murphy said the plan would
eliminate al! boss rule from the conven
tion.
A. Cridge said it was the only plan that
was just and right, and that even in a
convention of -.60 only twenty needed to
vote "first" for one man to insure repre
sentation on the ticket.
A number of delegates were on their
feet In an instant to explain the proposi
tion.
A proposition to amend the report bv
assessing each delegate $1 was rultd out
of order by Chairman Millmore.
Delegate McAdam offered as an amend
ment to the section relating to tho elec
tion of Supervisors that the proportional
system of repi-oscntation be adopted In
order "that the minority might have a
show."
The report recommended a* line of busi
ness to be followed in i.he convention and
the order of nominations. A majoritv rule
will be required to elect. ' Each candidate
will place $5 In the hands of the secretary
as soon as his name is presented. The or
der cf nominations decided upon is as fol
lows: Mayor. Sheriff. County Clerk, Re
corder. District Attorney. Coroner, Aud
itor,. Treasurer. City .-ind County, Attor
ney, .Tax Collector, Public Administrator
two Police Judges, eighteen Supervisors
and the selection^of an executive commit
tee.
Chairman Eag: t n of the committee on
permanent organization and rules of or
der and business in his opening remarks
drew a fine distinction between the report
that t!ie committee filed Thursday after
noon and the one filed yesterday. The
first was, according to the chairman, that
of the committee on permanent organiza
tion, and the 1-itter that of the rules of
order and business committee.
The claims of Judge Robert Ferral for
District Attorney are being advocated In
the lobby by Walter Gallagher and other
old-time campaigners. Guy Lathrop, sec
retary of the State Federation of Labor,
is the only one suggested as a candidate
for County Clerk. â¢
Police Judges Conlan and Fritz are anx
ious to secure renominations for the va
cancies that occur next year. With this
point gained they feel that the Demo
cratic nomination twould fall to them
without much trouble.)
I. Less will not have a walkover for
Public Administrator; as Jeff Wallace or
the Machinists' Union will have a big
backing from the Iron Trades Council and
the City Front Federation. Only two can
didates have announced themselves for
Supervisor, but as there are eighteen
places to fill no dearth of candidates is
expected. W. J. Wynn. secretary of the
convention, and Joseph Roxburg, a prim
er, are the avowed candidates.
But one little breeze stirred the morning
session of the convention. The minutes
were read in a perfunctory manner, and
all reference* to the Parry episode of the
previous day was ordered expunged.
Delegate Hutchinson created a slight
stir when the names of a number of alter
nates were read and recommended for
seats by the committee on credentials.
"That committee never met," said
Hutchinscn, "and as a member of it I ob
ject to any sta.' chamber proceedings."
Delegate Hutchinson was then afforded
a chance to pasr upon the credentials ot
the asriiing is cg-ates, and later thoy were
seated.
For Sheriff H. M. Burnett of the Ma
chinists and J. C. Lane of the Cooks' and
Waiters' Alliance are mentioned.
As the committee may go out of the
ranks of labor for legal nominees, Frank
lin K. Lane, who at one time belonged to
a typographical union, stands a good
chance tor nomination for City and Coun
ty Attorney, althougn Cameron H. King
br., nominee of the bociallst party, Is also

For the nomination for Mayor James 6a
Succa, an insurance agent, appears to be
in the lead. He was formerly a "deputy
under Sheriff Laumeister and is a member
of Ironmolders* Union No. 164, although
he has not worked at his trade for many
years. W. H. Goff, president of the San
Krancisco Labor Council, is also men
tioned, but it is said he .would prefer to
be named for Supervisor. Eugene Schmltz
of the Musicians' Union is also in the
field. His claims are being pressed by a
number of bandmasters. There is some
talk of a dark horse.

that the convention will be ready at that

CHICAGO. Sept. 6.â Senator Cullom 3?.ld
to-night: "Abraham Lincoln, James A.
Garfleld and William McKiriley were the
thrf e' Presidents most theroucjnly. in-sym-.
pathy, apparently, with the great body of
common -people of the country that we
have had since the beginning of our con
stitutional government. Mr," Lincoln was
assassinated in the early part of hla
second term, Mr. Garfield during the first
few months of his first term, and an at
tempt has been made to assassinate Presi
dent McKinley , in the early part of his
second term. It seems strange, to my '
mind, that such a fate should befall such
men-men . who . were generous to' a fault
and that were faithfully performing the
greafduties of their'hlsh office. No man
is of a more kindly* nature than President
McKinley. His heart beats in unison with
the great body of people of the country
and of the world. 1 His sole purpose is to
do his duty, to takecare that "the laws be
faithfully executed and that the country
should go on in its career of growth and
prosperity. I sincerely hope he may .re
cover to. carry out his" purpose in the
interest of the United States Government
and of the people I and to ; the end ofhte'

deservedly, too. \ Even \ on yesterday v he

fine physical condition, would pull him
through. Mr. Dawes, accompanied by his
wife, \-islted President and Mrs. McKinley

interview' with thfcm. He foundthe Presi
dent in splendid health and 'physically
robust.
Motion, amendment and substitute fol
lowed each other in such rapid succession
that the chairman, secretary and dele
gates became confused. .Finally, it was
ur?ed that those delegates that were com
pelled-to work during the day should be
given a chance to vote for candidates -and
a compromise was effected between all
factions by selecting Tuesday night) at 8 1
o'clock as the time for the: next assem

The questions as to the date to which
the convention should adjourn after the
days labors were finished caused much
discussion. Some delegates favored hold-

Eighthâ We demand the establishing of a
free market, where thÂ» producer can bring

further demand that the Pollc" and Fire de

ducted strictly- In accordance with the law,
insuring the same protection to all citizens
and strangers alike.
Ninthâ We- favor arbitration to the oxtent
that it b- found just and practicable under
our conditions In all Industrial disputes be- N

mend an investigation of thÂ» workings of
the Conciliation and State Arbitration
boards of, the different States of the Union
and other countries where the same are in

Tenthâ We believe the best interests of â¢
education require that the School Depart
ment be entirely divorced from politics and '
that advancement depend on merit alone to
the exclusion of personal and political fa- Â£
voritlsm and pledge our nominees to carry
out this reform. Furthermore we recom
mend that all Asiatics, both Chinese and
Japanese, should be educated separately

themselves.
Kleventh â We approve of the civil service

- Fifthâ We demand that all suODlif a for
the r-ublic institutions of . the city and
county of San Franclseo bear the union
label when such can be provided, and goods
of home manufacture b-j given preference.
Sixthâ We pledge our nominee for Mayor

this city be owned and onerated by the
municipality, and that no employe of this
city be compelled to wear a uniform, ex
cepting members of the Fire Department
and of the regular and. special Police De
partment.
Seventhâ We demand the building of sub
stantial school housesâ preferably of brick
or stoneâ and at least one such building to
be erected each year until ample accom
modations ore provided for all school chil
dren cf this city, and no more money
wasted by repairing' worthless school build

necessary and for other public works that'
will be of benefit to the city at larfte and

of President McKinley, spoke of the at
tempted assassination of the President as
follows: - "The news of the attempted as
sassination of President MeKinley, wheth

with unspeakable horror and grief. There
never lived a man of more kindly dispo
sition, with a more loving 1 and affection
ate heart, more tender and sweet In hts
sympathies and in hi3 private life, moro
devoted to his family and his friends. In
those regards he is the most remarkable
man I ever met in public life. The at
tempt upon his life was not because hÂ»
was William McKinley. but because ha
was President of the United States."

D. Long, Secretary of the Navy, who,
has been passing his vacation at the t^onsr

learned of the shootinjr of the President
I to-night. He wa3 deeply affected by th&
news, which came to him . -wtiile he wa*
in the village. He proceeded to his homÂ«Â»

BLOOMINGTON. 111.. Sept. 1-Former
Vice President Stevenson dictated tha
following statement to-night:
"The attempted assassination of Presi

too horrible for belief. The news will

all his countrymen. .1 have known Presi

He was a gentleman of the kindliest feel

Somebody cut Captain Leale's barge-

Alcatraz. â¢---.Â¦. â¢ .
The American ship A. G. Ropes arrived
from Yokohama yesterday In ballast.
, The cannery tender Jennie arrived from
Cooks Inlet yesterday. Before leaving
she towed the ship Centennial to sea on
August 27. The captain of the Jennie re
ports leaving -In port the steamer Bertha
and the ship Berlin.
The steamship Newburg, bound from
Grays Harbor for San Pedro, reported to
Point Reyes yesterday that she spoke the
French bark Empereur Menelik, fifty-nine
days from Newcastle, Australia, for San
Francisco.
The name of the new barkentlne Mat
thew Turner has been changed to Ama
ruth. The vessel was Â» namea without the
consent of the veteran shipbuilder, and
he refused to allow her to go to sea until
the name was changed. The Amaruth is
chartered to load lumber for Salinas
Cruz. . . â¢ . Â¦ - - - -
The freight transport Lennox Is sched
uled to Ball this morning for Manila. She
is laden with grain and fodder. . ... .
Another of the fleet of colliers coming
here from the East .for the coast trade
made port Thursday night. She is the
steamship Eureka of Falrport, Ohio, and
brings a cargo of 1800 tons of Pocahontaa
coal for the navy.
The Eureka had rather a hard time of It
on her way here, encountering in the Pa
cific a "heavy storm, which, damaged the
rudder. The vessel had. to be taken into
Talcahuano for repairs. Another start
was then made and the machinery got out
of gear. A stop was made at Valparaiso,
and after five days of hard work the Eu
reka was ready for sea again. She did
not make any more stops until San Fran
cfsco was reached.
A strange coincidence Is that while the
Eureka was putting into Talcahuano on
July 10 with her rudder, damaged the Me
teor, another of the fleet, was putting
into Rio de Janeiro with her rudder dam
aged.
JThe Eureka was built by the Cleveland
Shipbuilding Company of Lorain, Ohio, in
1899 for the Eureka Transportation Com
pany of Cleveland, Ohl<<. Her advent on
the coast will complicate matters some
what, as there is. already a- steamship
Eureka running 'between here and Hum

steamer Thoroughfare nearly swamped
them. They floated around at the mercy
of the tide until the McNeil came along
and towed them to the Folsom-street

Sheriff Hammel was notified of the ar
rest and will arrive here to-morrow to
take Woodworth to Los Angeles.
When arrested Woodworth had on his
person more than $1000 in paper money,
$600 of the amount being In $100 bills and
the balance in bills of smaller denomina
tions.
Woodworth says that after he paid over
the money and as he left the house he
saw an old man on the place, a stranger
to him. He has been camping at Long
Beach with his father and sisters.
Woodworth was very nervous and was
apparently laboring under some great
mental strain. He denies absolutely that
he took the money, and says he wants the
affair sifted to the bottom. He says that
after he paid the money to the Kempleys
he left the premises and was driven to the
train by a clergyman. He -went to Los
Angeles and just had time to catch the
northbound train, intending to go East.
He further declares that he immediately
sent the deed by registered letter to Iowa
to be recorded. <
According to the story of the theft as
given in The Call this morning. Wood
worth paid Mrs. Kempley $29,000 yester
day, that being the purchase price of a
ranch in Iowa. Kempley at the time was
absent in Los Angeles. A deed had al
ready been prepared and upon the pay
ment of the money was delivered to
Woodworth. Mrs. Kempley placed the
money in a trunk and left the house for
a few moments, and when she returned
both the money and Woodworth were
gone.
Sheriff Mansneld this morning received
a dispatch from Sheriff W. A. Hammel
of Los Angeles County asking him to ar
rest Woodworth, who. It was believed,
had gone north. A stranger arrived here
on tho morning train and left a few par
cels at the depot. He then purchased a
ticket to Palo Alto. From the descrip
tion of this man Sheriff Mansfield was
satisfied that he was Woodworth. Dep
uty Sheriff Butts left. for Palo Alto and
returned on the 3 o'clock train. Wood
worth was on board, and when the train
reached here Woodworth alighted to get
his parcels. It was then that the Sheriff
arrested him. - ...

C. C. Shattuck, a retired drayman, made
an attempt at suicide last evening In the
office of the California Investment Com

shuffle off the earth by the cyanide of
potassium route, a very fast one indeed,
but upon biting off a piece of the deadly
stuff from a chunk he had purchased he
experienced a severe burning sensation
about his mouth. He spat .the stuff on
the floor and then waited for the coming
of his son,- to whom he had telephoned
some time before he attempted to swal
low the poison. Upon the arrival .of his
son he Informed him what he had done
and the young man had him taken
immediately to the Receiving Hospital.
As a precautionary measure the doctors
pumped and washed out his stomach and
he was subsequently removed to his home
at 48 Portola street. The doctors are of
the opinion that Shattuck did not swallow
any of the poison, for a very -small quan
tity will quickly cause death.
Business reverses and the attachment of
his funds in bank by a creditor led Shat
tuck to attempt his life. His son, C. C.

CHARLES CARSON DIES
SITTING HT A CTTATB
Up a Brief Career of Dis
sipation.
Son of a Popular Clergyman Winds
Charles, Carson, a crisp maker, was
found dead yesterday morning in Travels
livery stable, at 2634 Mission street. .
Carson was a son, of the late Rev. A. N.
Carson of the Presbyterian church,:cor
ner of Twenty-third and Capp streets, and
fell heir a short time ago to 'some prop
erty left by : his father, since' which time
he had been engaged in a career. v =.of
dissipation and squandered all his sub
stance. -,-.'
He had been making his living recently
as. a crisp maker and slept In the stable.
At 8 o'clock yesterday morning J. J.
Traver, proprietor of the stable, went Into
his room and found Carson dead, sitting
in a chair. Carson was 30 years^ old, .a
native of New York . and married. The
body was removed to the Morgue. An in
quest will be held.
Actress Sues for Salary.
The trial of the suit of Lorena Atwood,
against Belasco & Thall, managers of the
Alcazar and Central theaters, for $150, al
leged to be due as salary for two weeks,
was begun in Justice of the Peace Dunn's
court yesterday. Miss Atwood alleges that
she was discharged without due notice.
The managers assert that she was given
the regular two weeks' notice.
Gillespie Decision Postponed.
"When the case of George D. Glllesple,
charged with the murder of W. F. Griffin,
one of his roomers, on August 20, was
called in Judge Conlan's court yesterday
the Judge said he was not prepared to give
his decision and continued the case till
this morning.
When questioned on the matter yester
day St. John would neither affirm nor
deny the rumor. Following the example
of C. M. Hays, whose successor he may
be, St. John would deliver himself of no
positive statement in support of the rumor
that he has come here to fill one of the
highest places in the great railroad cor
poration, neither would he deny it.
"I like newspaper men," he said, ana
generally do all I can for them, but on
this, occasion I must decline to be inter
viewed. I'll be here for several days
â¢'But will you deny that you are to re
main here permanently?"
"My dear fellow, I must decline to be
interviewed,' and St John hurried away.
Other railroad men, while denying ail
positive knowledge of St. John being given
an important place In the employ of the
Southern Pacinc, seemed to consider such
a possibility aa being worthy of attention.
They say that St. John is one of the best
known and most competent men in the
railroad business, that he stands high in
the estimation of the Harriman people,
that he has recently resigned a position
carrying a salary of about $30,000 a year
and that no one can find out why he re
signed. Moreover, there is no plausible
reason for his being on this coast at this
time other than one connected with the
changes that are sure to follow upon the
acceptance of the resignation of Hays.
Whatever the place St. John is destined
to occupy in the Southern Pacinc it is
sure to be a high one. He would not have
resigned the vice presidency and general
managership of the Seaboard Air Line
and the princely salaries that go with
these positions unless he had something
gcod In view and there is nothing here
outside of the office of president or gen
eral manager of the Southern Pacific that
could compensate him for the change.
It is hardly probable, however, that St.
John will relieve General Manager Krutt
schnitt. While an expert railroad man,
Sf. John has given more attention to the
traffic, political, executive and administra
tive Darts of the business than he has to
the operating end of it and though com
petent in every branch of the work he
has hardly had that special training that
Is an absolute requisite In one who has to
till the place filled by Julius Kruttschnitt.
This being the case, the only other places
that are open to a man of his standing
are the presidency itself or some specially
created office that would have much to do
with the freight and passenger traffic de
partments of the company.
St. John was born in Connecticut in 1844.
He first entered the railroad business as a
clerk in the ticket office of the Quincy and
Toledo railroad. From that position he
rose rapidly through successive grades un
fcfl he finally was given the position of
general manager of the Chicago, Rock Is
land and Pacific. From that road he re
signed in 1895 to accept the vice presidency
of the Seaboard Air Line. About a year
after his acceptance of tuat position his
authority was further increased by hav
ing the responsibilities of a general man
ager added to his duties as vice president.
From the Seaboard Air Line he resigned
several months ago.
Registered at the Palace Hotel Is a gen
tleman whose presence in the city Is caus
ing all sorts of rumors to fly through the
big building of the Southern Pacific Com
pany on the corner of Market and Mont
gomery Btreets. His name is Everitte St.
John. It is said he has come out here to
accept one of the principal executive po
sitions in the Southern Pacific What the
position 1b has not been definitely deter
mined, but the guesses range from presi
dent down to general manager.
"I shall not lose any sleep worrying over
the despicable trick of the Governor. I do
not suppose, however, that the knowl
edge that his corner grocery political tac
tics have been discovered will cause him
any unrest."
"Governor Gage has not the Instincts of
a gentleman, and I am not a bit surprised
to hear that he had my footsteps dogged
through Chinatown by hired shadows,"
said Dr. Ryfkogel yesterday when In
formed that the State Board of Examin
ers were passing on bills for the services
of operatives who shadowed him and the
other physicians employed by the Fed
eral authorities to examine into the health
conditions of the Chinese quarters. Â¦â¢'
"Morse's men must be very good at the
shadow game, for this Is the first I have
heard of them. I have not the least idea
why the Governor or the people to whom
he tenders good billets should pursue the
course they did except that they thought
that I was going about among the Celes
tials inoculating them with the plague
bacilli. I am rather inclined to think,
though, that it was done to give some of
his political * cronies, many of whom are
fit only for such work, a chance to get
their hands into the money appropriated
by the State. They earned their money
very easily, for most of my work was
laboratory work â¢ and during the whole
time that I was engaged at it I do not
believe that I made a half dozen trips
through Chinatown.
"I have a bill of $250 against the State
which has never been paid, in fact I have
been informed positively that it never will
be pajd. The only reason I can assign for
that small trick is that the conclusions
I formed regarding the presence of the
plague in Chinatown did not coincide with
those formed by the Governor and his
myrmidons. Dr. Mouser, who worked
exactly the same length of time on the
same class of work that I did, but who
arrived at a conclusion which differed
with mine, put in a bill fpr three times the
amount and was paid without question.

Tommy Wallace, Ac

Arson, Is Released.
Became Noted Through Con
nection "With Theft of.
Painting "Elaine."
Tommy Wallace, . the noted crook, was
arrested early yesterday morning on sus
picion of having attempted to set fire to
a lumber yard at Mission and Spear
Btreets. He was discovered behind a pile
of lumber with a lighted match in his
fingers, and as it was thought he was
trying, to set fire to the place he was
taken into custody. After being locked
up for several hours Wallace satisfied
Captain Seymour that he was not bent
on committing arson and he was re
leased.
i Wallace is one of the most famous
criminals in the country. He first came
to the notice of the police of this city
when he stole the celebrated painting
"Elaine," which was on exhibition at
Morton and Kearny streets. Wallace was
assisted in the theft by two well-known
Eastern crooks. After stealing the paint
ing Wallace hid it in the rear of a house
on Mission street, where it was found by
Captain I. W. Lees.
, Before his capture could be effected
Wallace left the city and went to Min
neapolis, where he was engaged to marry
a very respectable young woman. Some
time afterward Captain Lees happened to
be in Minneapolis and he recognized Wal
lace. . He brought him back to this city
and charged him with the theft of the
painting. After a short trial he was con
victed and sent to San Quentin for four
teen years. He served only five years of
his sentence, however. Â¦
After being released Wallace went to
Portland, where he was arrested for
breaking a show window and stealing a
large jar containing over $100 In nickels.
For this crime he was sentenced to five
years in the penitentiary at Salem. He
was discharged a few years ago and since
then he has been arrested on a number of
occasions for helping himself to the prop
erty of others. -
JUDGE DE HAVEN MATTES
' AWARDS IN PETERS CASE
Liability of the Steamboat in Damage
Cases Fixed at Six Thou
sand Dollars.
; United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday handed down an opinion in the
matter of the limitation of liability of the
river steamboat J. D. Peters in the matter
of the collision with the Czarina in San
Francisco Bay November 2, 1898. He fixed
the value of. the Peters at $6000 and made
the following awards: Eight hundred dol
lars to the Ship Owners' and Merchants
Tugboat Company, $800 to M. P. Lesher,
a passenger, and $12,000 to the John D.
Spreckels & -Bros. Company. The tug
boat people are to be -paid, in full and the
remaining awards are to be made prorata
on the remaining $5200 of valuation.
Judge de Haven finds that the J. . D.
Peters was in a seaworthy condition and
her master and pilot competent officers,
having been such for twenty years.
Hence, under the Harter act, express
companies and ! others having freight on
board were not entitled to recover. Â¦ The
representatives of the Chinese who were
drowned have produced no evidence to
show that they would have benefited by
the lives of the 'dead men or that they
suffered any loss by reason of their death.

CELTIC CELEBRATION
AT GLEN.PAKK MONDAY
I. Sinsabaugh, who played a star game
in the doubles tournament, was a strong
favorite over Percy Murdock, but the
latter won in straight sets. The score In
favor of Murdock was 7-5, 6-3, 6-3. Sinaa
baugh was troubled with a stiff knee.
The first match in the semi-finals was
between R. N. Whitney, and Harold
Brayley. The latter, on account of his
rather easy victory over Hunt, was con
sidered to have a splendid chance of
beating Whitney, but it was soon appar
ent that the local man. would win. Whit
ney played a steady chop game and took
the first two sets easily, 6-2, 6-0. In the
third set Brayley improved considerably
and won, 6-3, but the final set went to
Whitney, 6-3. Brayley was greatly handi
capped by blistered feet.
In the other match of the semi-flnila
A. Bell was opposed to Percy Murdock.
The latter played a good game and drove
well, but Bell who was i more confident
than in the morning, won in straight sets,
the score being 6-3. 6-4, 6-3. . ; ._
Whitney and Bell will play the final
match this morning at 10 o'clock. Unless
Bell Is capable of playing a better game
than he put up yesterday Whitney should
win without very much difficulty.
In the afternoon, at 2:30, the champion
ship match in doubles will be played be
tween the Whitney brothers, the present
coast champions, and McGavin and
Smith, the winners of the tournament.
The Whitneys will probably win, but the
youngsters play a strong game and the
match will be very close.
The next match in the second round was
between Harold Brayley and Reuben
Hunt. Hunt was expected to win, but the
match went to Braley, three sets out of
four. The score was 6-4, 6-4, 9-11, 6-2. .
As was expected, by. far the best and
most stubbornly contested match of the
tournament was between Grant Smith
and Bell. This was the only match In
either tournament that required the full
five sets to settle the question of suprem
acy. Bell won 2-6. 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0. The
winner was a strong favorite, but he came
very near losing to his tall opponent-
Smith won two sets out of three, handily,
but the many long and hard matches in
which he played on the two previous days
left him in poor condition toward the end.
Bell was perfectly fresh, having played
but four sets during the week, while
Smith played twenty sets on Wednesday
and Thursday.- â¢ ' /
Bell was very nervous and probably not
at his best, while Smith was perfectly ccol
and confident. The first set went to the
latter, 6-2, rather easily. In the second
set the loser also had a lead, but his
opponent braced and won. out, 6-3. In the
third set Bell led at 2-0, but Smith ran
it up to 5-3 in his favor and won out 6-4.
The first part, of the fourth set was close,
but Smith soon began to fly signals of
distress and from then on everything
went Bell's way. It' was rather an un
satisfactory ending to such a good match.
Both players ran in on their service, and
it was a constant fight for the net. â¢
Play in the singles tournament was
completed yesterday down to the final
round, and as a result R. N. Whitney of
San Francisco and Alfonso Bell of South
ern California will play In the finals Ihls
morning. The winner will meet' Champion
George Whitney on Monday afternoon at
2:30 o"clock for the championship of the
coast.

Of a woman in perfect health attracts
the eye at once. Such a woman is all
too rarely seen. The most of women
bear scars of suffering _ on their faces
which no smiles

the womanly
weakness which-

There can he no

suffers from dis-

makes weak women strong and sick

orders and diseases; brightens the dull

gives strength for wifely duties and

Â« My health is the best now that it has been
for four years," writes Mrs. phebe Morris, of Ira,
Cayugm Co., N. Y.. Box 5a. "I have taken but
two Dottles of yonr medicine, 'Favorite Pre-
scription* and 'Golden Medical Discovery.'.
These medicines have done me more good than
all that I have ever taken before. I couldn't-do
my work only about half the time, and now I
can work all the time for a family of four.
Before I took your medicines I was sick in bed
nearly half the time. My advice to all who are
troubled with female weakness is to take Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription and ' Golden Med-
ical Discovery' â the most -wonderful medicines
la the -world."
