ficers of the navy and slated for honorable
retirement as rear admiral on September
21, has .been convicted by court-martial

tending to the prejudice of good morals."
The record of the proceedings, findings
and sentence of the court-martial was re
ceived at the â¢ Navy Department to-day
and. is being reviewed by. the judicial of
ficers. The maximum penalty for the of
fense of which Captain Imfrey was con
victed is dismissal, but In view of his lonsr
service the court gave him the lesser but
still severe, sentence of a -substantial re*
ductlon in numbers.
Captain Imf rey's trial grew out of a dla-*
puto- over a dentist's bill/ Captain Im-Â»
frey is stationed at the Mare Island Navy
Yard; near San Francisco. The dentist
who treated him professionally submitted
a bill for $50. Captain Imfrey wrote to
the dentist that the . Government paid

not authorize tho expenditure of so large
a sum for' filling; teeth and suggested that
the amount be reduced to a reasonable fig

C. M. G., British Minister to Japan and late Minister to
China, arrived yesterday", from the Orient with his wife.
Lady Ethel Macdonald, ' oii the steamship Hongkong
Maru. They are quartered at the Palace Hotel. Sir
Claude bas a distinguished record both as a soldier and a dip

of England is a man of superb physique, courteous and amia

"We are glad to get to America," said Sir Claude last night,
"for we have never. beÂ»n in this country before. I 'went; to
China for the first time in January, 1S96, and staycd,-there for
four years. â¢ The work was very arduous and the climate in
Peking very trying, and in May. 1Â£99, I took my. wife home to
Kngland for' a' visit. .. I ask'ed.the Government to allow me to
go to Japan; and that Sir Ernest Satow,;the Minister to Japan,
might be sent to Peking. ' Sir Ernest was willing to make the
change, but. I did not get ; to Japan ' as j soon as I had antici

possibility of China paying a large indemnity- to the foreign
powers the diplomat answered: Â¦ . _i '..<,Â¦ "-. ..:
"J have been away from China since last October' and do
not know just what amount has been decided upon, but what
ever the sum may he it is quite impossible to say if China, can
meet the demand. " Whether she be called' upon to~*pay one
hundred and fifty million dollars or. twice that- amount, .it- is
equally problematical- if she can pay. 'China â¢publishes'; no
financial budget and one figures in the dark when it comes to
computing what the Government raises by taxation and" im
port duties." â¢ . ' .* . Â¦''Â¦.'.
Many Causes for the- Boxer Uprising. Â¦
Sir Claude MacdonaTd is of the opinion that there were
many causes for, the Boxer uprising. " .' , . Â¦Â¦â¢';
"It was not due alone to the anti-missionary feeling,*,' he
said, ,','and , the causes were far reaching. The acquisition- of
territory by the powers^was one of the chief causes'., .'Iti, in

SANTA CRUZ. June 13.-At a point
6.bcut one hundred yards this side of the
entrance to tunnel No. 6 on the narrow
gauge line to San Francisco and one mile
from Kelton a serious train wreck oc
curred a few minutes after 2 o'clock this
afternoon. Engineer James Stanley and
Fireman Henry Coyle were severely in
jured, but the fifty passengers in the cars
were not hurt.
The train consisted of seven coaches and
left the station about ten minutes late. It
was making up the lost time on the run
to Felton. After swinging around the
trestle curve before reaching the tunnel
the locomotive jumped the track and
bumped over the ties for nearly 100 feet.
Then It struck against the wall of granite
en the left side of the road and stopped
with a crash that shivered every part of
it? mechanism. The smokestack was car
ried away, projecting bowlders tore off
the roof of the cab and the tender, which
had become detached from the engine,
toppled into the gorge of the San Lorenzo
River, a hundred feet below. The for
ward trucks of the baggage car left the
rails end the front end and side of the
car were broken by contact with the
rocks. The passenger coaches remained
en the track.
Rescue of Injured Men.
The terrified passengers rushed to the
platforms of the cars in a state of panic,
and several had to be restrained from
leaping into the gorge. The train men
hurried to the engine and found Fireman
Coyle pinned down by the wheels of the
fcasrgafre car. It took twenty minutes to
extricate Mm. KIs leps were crushed, his
left eye was partially gouged out and he
was suffering from internal injuries. En
pir.eer Stanley, who was lying alongside
the engine, was also injured internally
nrd was bleeding from a deep scalp
v.oun<3. Dr. Mear^s of Philadelphia was
on the train, ana with the meager mate
rial at hand did all he could to alleviate
the suffering- of the men. Miss Kate
White of Oakland, who had been visiting
her aunt. Mrs. F\ W. Swanton, in Santa
Cruz and was returning home, did excel
lent service for the injured. She had her
trunk opened and tore up some of her
wearing apparel to make bandages.
Word was immediately sent to the pow
der works, two rr.i'.ep away, and for a few
hours about forty of the men were spared
from the works to clear the wreck. They
brought medical supplies and did much to
aid the injured trainmen. Dr. Morgan
and Dr. Knight of Santa Cruz were early
at the scene. While assisting: in the res
cue work H. Foster, a merchant of this
city, his hack.
Mystery About the Cause.
The cause of the ace'dent is not known.
Trackwalker Muthern declares that no
rocks had fallen on the railF. It is con
cert ured by some that the tender was so
heavily laden that in swinging around the
curve it swayed more than usual and iost
Its balance.
J. F. Maloney. United States mall clerk
on the wrecked train, considers himself
the luckiest man living. In an Interview
he stated:
"I noticed that we were going at an
tnusral speed for that part of the' road
and leaned out the Fide door to ascertain
the cause. Juct as I looked out we struck
the sharp curve at the south entrance of
tunnel No. <5. and the tender left the
track. I went tr. the opposite door with
the intention of jumping, and as I did so
the mail car shot past the tender. Had
I jumped I would have been instantly
crushed betwÂ«<?n the mail car and the
tender."
The injured engineer and fireman were
conveyed to the Southern Pacific Hos
pital In San Francisco. At Glenwood they
were Joined by Fireman Coyle's father,
who accompanied them on the remainder
of their journey.

Mr. Emmeluth made, a strong protest
against recognizing In any manner, the
authority of Secretary Cooper as Acting
Governor. It is learned that the Home
Rule apprehension is that the executive
plan !s -to have the Legislature adjourn
under the existing status, so that Mr.
Cooper may continue indefinitely as Act
ing Governor, thus obviating, as the ex
ecutive party hones, the necessity of the
appointment by the President of a succes
sor to Mr. Dole.
The Grand Jury has finished its bribery
investigation and is now engaged on ordi
nary criminal business. Its report on the
bribery matter is. however, on the closed
files and will be until warrants are issued

SAN BERNARDINO, June 13.-Roy
Baxter, aged 17 years, and May Green

mer?, have been lovers for several
months. When the subject of their mar
riage was broached to their parents the
latter strenuously objected. The young
people appeared willing to abide by the
decision of their elders, and little more
was thought of the love match outside the
charmed circle of the lovers. It now ap
pears to have been another case of love
rinding the way without troubling the
locksmith.
After taking a walk last night -the two
young people decided to outwit the stern
parents and this morning boarded an
<-arly train for Los Angeles, where they
Expected to procure a license and be mar
ried. The father of the prospective groom
learned of their plans late this evening
and immediately started to Los Angeles
for the purpose of preventing the union if
possible. The young man, being- under age.
may not be given the license unless it Is
obtained under false pretenses.

the common law wife of an invalid Span

had enough presence of mind last night to
tear her clothing off and jump into a near

ful death by flre. : Â»
Despite her affliction the woman for the
past few years .has been better able to
work than her sick husband, and has
made a living for the two by gardening.
Last evening she attempted to burn dry
grass away from the vicinity of their
home. The fire got away from her, and in
her efforts to place it under, control she
set fire to her dress.
With a wild scream the blind woman
tore off all her clothing, and running to a
creek near by jumped into the water Ind
suffered only a few slight burns. A por
tion of the house was destroyed, but the
husband was not Injured. Fortunately
for him, the blind woman succeeded in
extinguishing the flames after she had
saved herself in the creek. The fire
burned for three -miles north and a mile
south, endangering numerous miners'
cabins, which were only saved by hard
effort. This morning the blaze was work-

provide for the election of all the officers

LOS ANGELES, June 13.â Thirteen
statesmen who help to guide the destinies
of the nation. spent a few hours at San
to-day on their tour of Inspection
of the big breakwater and the inner and
outer harbors. Four members of the Riv
ers and Harbors Committee were absent
when a special train over the Southern
Pacific Railroad pulled out of the Arcade
station for San Pedro at 9:30 o'clock.
The inspection, party was composed of
Theodore E. Burton of Cleveland, Ohio
chairman: Walter Reeves of Streator, 111
Roswell P. Bi.shop of Ludington, Mich :
Erne F. Acheson of Washington Pa Â¦
Page Morris of Duluth, Minn.; De Alva.
S. Alexander of Buffalo, N. Y.; Thomas
H. Tongue of Hillsboro, Or.; George P
Lawrence of North Adams, Mass. ; James
H. Davidson of Oshkosh, Wis.; Rufus E
Lester of Savannah, Ga.; James H. Bank
head of Fayette.s Ala.; Philip D. McCul
loch of Marlanr.a, Ark. ; Albert S. Berry
of Newport, Ky.; Frank- H. Hitchcock,
chief of the bureau of foreign markets of
the Department of Agriculture; J W
Hencke, secretary to Chairman Burton'
and Lyman M. Ellis, secretary to the
Rivers and Harbors Committee. A dele
gation of business men and members of
the Chamber of Commerce, accompanied
the visiting Congressmen.
Arriving at San Pedro the members of
the party were. taken by rail out to the
point where work is under way on the
breakwater. The big steam derrick and
a score of workmen were unloading rock
at the time of the arrival , of the party
and continued operations during its stay
in order that the Congressmen might
clearly understand how the work is per
formed. Captain. Meyler explained the
character and extent. of the work yet to
be performed. He said that 28,000 tons of
rock were dumped into Â¦ the breakwater
during May. This month the contractors
expect to dump 35,000 tons into the work.
Captain , Meyler explained that this ' will
meet . the requirements of the contract
with the Government. To all appear
ances the work is progressing as rapidly
and satisfactorily as could be. expected.
Many of the members of-* the Con
gressional committee expressed surprise
at the magnitude of the. undertaking.
Leaving the breakwater, steam launches
were boarded for a trip through the inner
harbor. During the trip about the inner
harbor Chairman Burton dictated to his
secretary frequent impressions of things
that attracted his attention. In -fact,
throughout the entire trip the chairman
kept his stenographer by his side and con
tinued to dictate to him page after page
of notes. The only time that Congress
man Burton actually ceased his- labors
was when he sat down to luncheon in the
Brighton Beach Hotel. .'
Concluding the trip about the inner har
bor the members of the party boarded
the steamer 'Falcon and were taken for a
trip about the outer harbor, passing tho
breakwater and "starting on the return
Journey nearly opposite ' Point Firmin.
This trip gave the members- of the board
a splendid opportunity to view the break
water and to take observations of the ex
tent and character of the â¢ operations.

CHINESE POUR
OVER THE LINE
A Startling Increase in
Smuggling in the
Northwest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. June 13.â After a
week of investigation at the boundary
line Chief Inspector Dunn of the Immi
gration Department on the Pacific Coast
has decided to recommend that special
commissioners be sent out from Washing
ton to take steps toward stopping the
enormous a.mount of unlawful smuggling
of Chinese and goods across the boundary
line into the United States.
There are at the present time only four
inspectors to guard as many hundred
miles of territory, and the object of the
special commission to go into the matter
will be to arrange a proper patrol sys
tem and make suggestions to the Govern
ment for the guarding of the Mexican
border as well as the one at British Co
lumbia. Dunn says that Chinese turn up
in California who have been shipped in
bond through Vancouver to Mexico, hav
ing broken through the southern bound
ary.
Inspector White, who has been here for
some time under Commissioner Healey,
acted as Dunn's assistant in making the
investigations. He has just made the ar
rest of two Italians and a third man who
had hired them in Canada to work on
railroads in Washington State. They
were the first of a large number to go
through and the whole gang was effect
ively stopped. The inspector was dis
guised as a rancher and held the party up
at the point of a revolver, Â¦which was the
only chance he had of capturing them.
Commissioner White says that the Chi
nese go across the line all the time, and
most of those who land in Vancouver
eventually make their way through to
California. There are from 100 to 200 land
ed here by every steamer and the number
in Vancouver does not grow large. The
officers also say that with Chinese them
selves and Oriental goods a large smug
gling business is carried on between here
and Puget Sound cities. The officials even
have information that the smugglers have
retained one of the best lawyers in the
city to advise them and keep them posted
on the operations of the authorities as
well as to protect them if they are
pounced upon. There is but one revenue
cutter in the local service and officials
state there is little chance of catching tho
offenders under present conditions..
It Is also the intention of Dunn to-Â«sk
the Washington authorities to endeavor
to solve the problem by handling it with
Dominion Government officials. The ille
gal traffic at the boundary has reached
such a serious state that it is almost
equally to the Interest of both countries
that something should be done.

Ida Shrouds, daughter of a Philadelphia
clergyman and an actress. Flagler mar
ried her in 1883, before he had amassed
millions. She was poor. In 1899 she was
declared a victim of chronic insanity and
committed to the sanitarium.
It is said Flagler spend- $1000 a month to
keep his wife in the luxury In which she
lives at the sanitarium. The story goes
that every night the demented woman

husband. He used to visit her frequent

sign of recognition of him.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 13.â Archbishop Cor
rlgan has bestowed tho decoration of the
Cross of Calvary upon seven women
prominent in the good works of the "Ro
man Catholic Church in' New York. The
order of the Dames de Calvare has here- I
tofore not been represented In. this coun- j
try, except by Mrs. Anna Blount Starrs,
who spent flf teen months in the Brus
sels house of the order. The new mem
bers will serve in the house of Calvary,
which Mrs. Starrs founded last year for
the care of poor women afflicted with In
curable cancer and kindred diseases.
The new members are Mrs. Thomas
Francis Meagher, Mrs. S. Goston Uall
ieff, Mrs. George liecker, Mrs. -Callxte
Hnrvier, Mrs. Joseph J. O'Donohue, Mrs.
Thomas Howard Peterson and Mrs. Sarah
A. Carroll. Mrs. Meagher 1b the presi
dent of the house and Mrs. Balltett the
vice-president. Mrs. Starrs Is the
mother superior. The order Is a' secular
one. . -
Their vow was that of consecration to
the work of alleviating human suffering.
They do not renounce the world. Cer
tain members of the order visit the house
daily. They wait upon patients and
wash their wounds. To do this they are
obliged first to take a course of In
struction from nurses of the cancer hos
pital.
Mrs. Peterson, who Is a member of the
prominent Peterson family of Phlladel
phlu, is the only new member of the or-
Oev who has as yet acquired this ability.
Only widows are admitted to the order,
which was founded in France by Mme.
Gamier.
The ceremonies attendant on the con
ferring of the decoration took place at
the Perry-street house on "Wednesday,
when also Archbishop Corrlgan blessed
an addition to the house, which has been
bought through contributions given by
wealthy Catholics to Mrs. Starrs.
Fathers Myhan and O'Flynn assisted
the Archbishop, who wore a white stole
sent by the mother of the house in Lyons,
France. The altar in the chapel will be
covered with linen from the same house.
When the alterations . are made the !
house will accommodate twenty-five pa- ,'
titnts. As they are incurable, they are
not received at regular hospitals, and |
such institutions as this are their only
refuge. Mrs. Catherine Dell, a trained j
cancer nurse from the cancer hospital, Is.
regularly in attendance on the patients.

During the steamship's run from Mazat

one of the masts and refused. When he
grew insolent C.iptain Judkins ordered
; him locked up. Then Daniel .Frias. took
| up the cudgel in behalf oÂ£ his ohipmate
and asked the iest of the crew to mutiny
and release Uieir comrade. He also was
placed in irons, and then there was peace
-and quietness. The' men were turned over
to the harbor police, but when the mat
ter was referred to the British Consul he
said the men would have to be taken back
to Chile, as there was no agreement be
tween the United States and Great Brit
ain by which mutineers on a British ves
sel can be tried in an American court.
Frias and Buzo will therefore be taken
back to Valparaiso for trial. "

Besides these there were six steerage
and two Chinese in transit.
Among the steerage passengers were L.
Veliaino and his wife. The man is a phys
ical wreck and any excitement nearly
drives him distracted. Vellaino is a Swiss,
and In company with a number of his
countrymen went to Chile to make a for
tune. They settled in a small place called
Victoria, "about a day's journey from
Talcuhuano. Vellaino had a little money,
and that fact soon reached the ears of the
bandits in the hills.. They swooped down
on the settlement, seized Vellaino's son,

STEAMSHIP COLOMBIA HEBE-
One of Her South American Passen-
FOR the first time in its history
San Francisco has three battle
ships and a second class cruiser
in addition to other warlike craft
in the bay. The battleship Iowa
has been at anchor off the transport
wharf for some time. A week ago the
Philadelphia came down from Mare Isl
and. Wednesday afternoon the famous
battleship Oregon came in from China via
Honolulu, and during the night the new
battleship Wisconsin arrived from Puget
Sound. The latter vessel made the splen
did run down the coast of sixty-five hours
from Port Orchard. That is an average
of about thirteen knots an hour for the
run, but there were hours when the bat
tleship logged her eighteen knots. Of
course, everything was in her favor, as
she is in perfect working order and had a
strong northwester behind her all the way
down.
The Iowa- and Wisconsin are the war.
vessels closest in shore. The former is
about off the transport wharf, while the
Wisconsin is oft Harriso"n-street wharf.
Out in midstream and almost between the
Iowa and Wisconsin lies the cruiser Phil
adelphia, while south of her and almost
in a line with Steuart-street wharf lies
the Oregon.
Never again in a time of peace may
such an aggregation of fighting machines
be seen in this port. Even now the Wis
consin is taking on her munitions of war
preparatory to starting for the Orient.
The Philadelphia is ready to sail for Sa
moa and will probably get away on the
ISth inst. The Iowa is to pay a visit to
all Puget Sound ports in a week or so.
and, last of all. the Oregon will go out of
commission. The chances are that she
will be' dismantled and put on the dry-:
dock for permanent repairs. The wounds
made by the rocks in the Gulf of Pechili
were only patched up. and a permanent
job has to be done. The turrets are to be
changed and a new battery Installed, so
when she is again in service she will be a
different Oregon from the one that went
into battle at Santiago. Â¦
Before the month is out the Government
expects to have between 500 and 600 school
teachers- on the way to Manila. At first
it was intended to fit the Sherman out to
take them down, but she cannot be got
ready owins to the strike. The Thomas,
due here the 20th inst., will be sent out
with the educators. In this connection the
following letter is self-explanatory r .

The Toyo Klsen Kaisha's Hongkong
Maru arrived yesterday a day ahead of

a couple of "suspects" among the crew.
A number of the Japanese sailors and fire

and then the mail boat was ' allowed to
dock.
The Hongkong Maru came Into port fly
ing the British flag at her fore, and the

a lad 17 years old, and demanded to know
where the money was hidden. The boy
laughed at them, so the ruffians strung
him up to the limb of a tree and riddled
his body with bullets. The father was
compelled to witness the death of his son
and then saw the robbers seize his wife.
When she refused to tell where the money
v/as hidden she was knocked down and
one of the gang was about to cut her
throat when the cry that the soldiers
were coming drove them off. It was
some of Vellaino's neighbors who, hear
ing the sound of firing, had come to his
assistance. Mrs. Vellaino soon recovered
from her injuries, but her husband seems

To-Day's Entries.
Doublet was the much shouted good
thing in the six furlong race, the fourth
on the card. Russell took this favorite to
the front early in the game, but nearly
lost to Prestidigitator by careless riding
from the paddock to the wire. "Presti"
made a strong finish, getting the place.
The fourth race brought more judicial
labors to the occupants of the stand, but
this time before the start. Rio Shannon,
owned by Thompson & Hagerman, was
entered. The attention of the judges was
called to the fact that Rio Shannon was
sick beyond the point or running, so an
investigation was made and a prompt rul
ing held on the facts. Rio was scratched,
the Thompson stable put under the ban
until January 1 and twenty minutes given
lor a new book. Hagerdon, the favorite at
even money, won this race handily, Rey
Dare getting the place and Byron Rose
the show.
Oscar Tolle, opening at 12 to 1 and clos
ing at 8 to 1, won the last race without
much trouble. Merops was an 8 to 5 fa
vorite and considered to be easy pick
ing. Merops was almost left â not by fault
of the starter but on account of eccentric
behavior. Merops broke when the barrier
was sprung, ran several yards and then
propped. At this time the bunch was far
in advance and Merops could not make
up the distance. Castake made the place
and Alicia the show.
Achilles had the speed yesterday and
when the three-quarter post was reached
led by a length, with Shell Mount follow
ing. Shell -Mount was riding easily an<l
as the two tore down the stretch it ap
peared for all the world as if the latter
would win with ease. Collis was not on
the winner. He displayed a strong pair
of hands whether controlled by ignorance
or malice aforethought.
Â£ir Hampton and Sweet Caporal were
the choices in the first race of the day,
the odds on the formjer spreading slowly
toward the closing. Sir Hampton with J.
McCarthy up worked up place by place
until the last burst, then winning out by
two lengths.
In the second race Burdock showed a
reversal of form, which the judges are in
vestigating. With Hoar in the saddle
Burdock won from Einstein, Hohenhole
and Guilder.
That Collis rode a wretched race there
can be ho doubt The judges charge his
performance to ignorance and inability
rather than to dishonesty. To the asphalt,
congregation and the occupants of the
stand with Shell Mount tickets in their
clothes it looked as if Collis worked the
brakes too diligently from the time the
stretch was reached until the wire was
passed. Collis certainly threw a winning
to the winds.
The judges' stand was the target for a
diJ-T-aUsfied public at the Oakland track
yesterday afternoon after the third race,
won by Achilles from Shell Mount. The
latter horse with Collis running the
brakes was the perfervid favorite, draw
ing a strong, Increasing play from the first
chalking till the horses went to the post.
Shell Mount was piloted in such a queer,
corkscrew manner that Achilles had no
trouble in winning. That is why the
crowd hooted and jeered . and gathered
about the stand with profane words on
their lips and .malice in their hearts." â¢". ;

The two teams then played a listless ex
hibition of four innings and the people
who remained to see them play left dis
gusted.
The only other feature of a very poor
exhibition was the , return of "Truck '
Eagan to the game. He played first for
Oakland and covered the bag in clever
style. Folowing is the score of the game
as far as it went:
â¢: SACRAMENTO. â¢
Strlcklett was the prime mover In the
insurrection. He went into the box in
flated with his own importance and was
sent skyward In the very first inning by
the Dudes, who hammered him for two
singles and a double, accepted a walk and
tallied five runs. The Senators were un
able to do anything in the second and
when Oakland came to bat they were
ready to Inflict further damage. Strick
le tt broke the rule that prevents a
pitcher taking two steps when delivering
the ball and^ Umpire Tyler gave Dunleavy
his base on balls. Strlcklett threw 'down
his glove in a passion and walked off the
field. There was a delay of five minutes
while the sulky youth was being induced
to resume pitching. He committed the*
same mistake a second time, either de
liberately or unconsciously, and another
man was allowed to walk. This was too
much for the Sacramento twirler and he
again left the game. The hoots and Jeers
that greeted his actions must have awak
ened a feeling of resentment in his heart.
but he failed to show it. Umpire Tyler
ordered the scorer to take time and he
warned Sacramento to. play ball. Hia
warning was supplemented by the crowd,
which yelled derisively at the visiting
legislators.
Devereaux then went into the box and
Oakland was retired in short order. Shee
han was first up for Sacramento and ha
tried talking back to the umpire and waa
promptly fined $5. The side was retired
in one. ' two, thre order. In the last of
the third the end came. Devereaux waa
in the box. He pitched a few times and
Tyler called it a ball. Devereaux thought
It should have been a strike. Ho turned
fiercely upon the umpire and was fined $5.
He tried back talk and was ordered off
the field. Tyler sent for a policeman,
but none could be found. There was
more delay and Oakland was given the
game by a score of 9 to 0. The spectators
hooted and hissed and then went down
and got rain checks which entitle them to
see another game.
Umpire Tyler acted the part of a school
master at the ball game yesterday, though
instead of inflicting the rod on half a doz
en sulky Senators, he fined a few and
then gave the. game to the Dudes by a
score of 9 to 0. The Sacramento aggrega
tion acted like so many overgrown coun
try bumpkins. They went to Recreation
Park with an ldea'of overawing or bluff
ing the umpire, but as the latter held the
high hand he stood pat and won every
time. â¢ .Â¦

KANSAS CITY, June 13. âThe case of

to live with her after a forced marriage,
will " probably go to the jury to-morrow
evening. The taking of testimony was fin

The defense sufferecNa second setback
to-day, when Judge Wofford ruled out a
conversation with Kennedy before the
killing tending to -corroborate evidence
offered- yesterday to prove that Kennedy
had admitted having ruined Lulu Prince.
Further expert testimony to prove that
the defendant was temporarily insane at
the time of the shooting was offered, and
Bert Prince, one of the quartet of alleged
conspirators, again took the stand, this
time for the defense ,and to prove an
alibi for himself. He denied that he had
predicted Kennedy's murder.

KENNEDY MURDER THIAL
IS DRAWING TO AN END
Been Before Heard in the
Courts.
NEW YORK, June 13.-Axel Hellen
berg, a stock broker, has through his
counsel applied to Justice Gildersleeve, in
the Supreme Court, for a receiver for the
Cobre Grande Copper Company of Ari
zona and an injunction restraining it from
disposing of any of its property pending
action. The Justice allowed the counsel
interested until .to-morrow to submit
briefs. â¢ â¢ _
The controversy over the mines or the
company has extended over a period of
two years, principally in Arizona, and the
present suit is an attempt upon the part
of Mr. Hallenberg to get a hearing'ln the
New York courts.
Mr. Greene, one of the defendants in
the present suit, was in New York on
May 28, and personal service of the sum
mons and complaint in an application for
an injunction was made upon him at that
time, not only in his individual capacity,
but as president of the Greene Consoli
dated Copper Company. Since that time
strenuous efforts have Â«been 'made by his
counsel to have the case dismissed on the
ground of the want of jurisdiction and
that the controversy should be remitted
to Arizona. A motion to that "effect was
recently denied. ...

San Francisco.A visiting prize-fighter gives us his assurance that
a vision of a fire engine is invariably an omen of
success for him. He might carry his faith in signs a
little further and gaze into the business end of a hose
while in action.
Ho Yow, the worthy Chinese Consul General at this
port, is making most vigorous, protest against the
landing of one of his countrymen in San Francisco.
Ho Yow might make as many of these protests as he
pleases and be assured that the more he made the
better we would like it.
The service, then, is desirable, feasible and useful
alike to the city, to the commercial interest and to
the Government. Such being the case the attention of
the officials at Washington should be at once called to
the matter, and the request for the establishment of
the service should be backed by every influence pos
eessed by our Congressmen, by our commercial bodies
and by the Federal officers at the port.
The usefulness of a prompt service between this city
and the Farallones is well understood by all who have
any interest in shipping news; npr would it be out
side the legitimate province of the Government to es
tablish it. In fact, it would be but an extension of
the lighthouse service. As was said by President Mc-
Xear of the Merchants* Exchange: "I believe it to
be within the province of this Government to con
struct such telegraphic system for the better protec
tion of our merchant marine. Also, it would be of
advantage to vessels in the Government service. They
could communicate with or receive orders without
the necessity of coming into the harbor. Vessels ar
riving off the port in distress, or requiring the ser
vices of a tug or other assistance, could, by signaling
the operator on the islands, communicate with the
city. Vessels coming to this coast in ballast with in
structions to get their orders off the harbor (to come
in or proceed to Portland or the Sound for their out
ward cargo) would be saved the inconvenience of de
lays. Such communication now is generally by the
pilot boats and necessitates considerable loss of time."
Of the feasibility of the service there can be no
question. Reports from Europe are to the effect that
the British have wireless telegraph stations at every
dangerous headland along their foggy and stormy
coasts. The Germans and the French also have
adopted the system to a considerable extent, and
only recently the news of the day illustrated the use
fulness of the service in the case of a steamer pass
ing a lightship off Dunk ; rk and receiving across the
water a wireless message to the effect that the illumi
nating machinery of the lightship was out of order
and that unless relief were sent there could be no light
on the ship that night. The steamer reported. the
news as soon as she reached port, and men were at
once sent to make repairs, so that the lightship
showed her signals as usual. In that case the -wireless
message may have saved from wreck some vessel
passing in the night and missing the familiar light
from the ship.
SENATORS, Representatives, merchants, ship
owners and citizens of influence, representing
commercial and industrial organizations, have
warmly commended the suggestion of The Call that
steps be taken to procure the establishment by the
National Government of a wireless telegraph service
between the Farallon Islands and this city. There
being unanimity of sentiment, it is reasonable to ex
pect something in the way of prompt and united ac
tion toward the desired end.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The establishment of so many new banks in a single
section of the country within seven months is an un
deniable proof of a rapid advance in the general pros
perity of the people. It is probable that none of the
new banks has a large capital, but the aggregate must
be considerable. The chief advantage is that the capi
tal is diffused throughout a wide extent of country
and that the benefits are widespread. Of course the
advantages to be derived from the banks are not to be
measured by the amount of their capital. Each of them
will serve as a financial reservoir for the collection
and distribution of the money in the community, en
abling the same funds to be used over and over again
and materially promoting every kind of industrial or
commercial entergrisc. *' , Â¦
When in connection with the extension of banking
facilities there is considered the improvement-going
on in the South in the way. of manufacturing and of
diversified rural industries there will be found ample
reason for believing that the blight of Bourbon poli
tics which has so long rested upon that section of the
Union will be removed by the force of prosperity it
self. The intelligence of the South cannot, fail to
perceive that the^ success of Bryanism; free silver and
free trade would ruin the bright. prospects that have
been raised by conservative government, sound money
and protection. It is therefore fair to expect that
hereafter it will be found supporting such policies in
the nation instead of making the South solid for any
and every kind of political folly that discontented
leaders can devise. ..
In a recent review of the situation the Atlanta Con
stitution says: "During the past seven months more
than one hundred banking institutions have been es
tablished in various parts of the South, and the dis
tribution among the various States is as follows:
Texas, 40; .Georgia, 13; Virginia, 13;' North Caro
lina, 11; Florida, 6; South Carolina, 9; Kentucky,
9; Arkansas, 6; 'Louisiana, 14; Tennessee, 5; Ala
bama, 5; Mississippi, 4, and Maryland, 5. While
some States have been more highly favored than
others, still there is no State throughout the section
which has not been favored to some'extent, and signs
of prosperity are general."
ONE of the more important factors in bringing
about the free silver craze in the Southern
States was the lack of adequate banking faciy
ties. By reason o.f that lack the people readily fell
into the belief that what they needed was more money,
and in that belief they would doubtless have supported
an unlimited issue of greenbacks just as readily, as
they supported the Western silver men had a green
back movement happened to be dominant at the time.
The need of a more general distribution of banking
and of money was. recognized by the framers of the
recent financial measures in Congress, and provision
was made for the establishment of small banks. The
South appears to have promptly profited by the op
portunity afforded by Republican legislation, and
there is no longer any complaint there of a lack of
currency or a lack of banks.
BANKING IN . THE SOUTH.
There have long been complaints of the increasing
extravagance in dress and living among the^ students
at Harvard and Yale. The ostentation of wealth which
mars so much of American life has intruded itself
into the very seats of learning, where it is supposed
\ he students are td be taught to respect higher things.
It now appears that fashionable colleges for girls in
New England are becoming as bad in that respect as
the universities. In place of the plain living and the
high thinking that formerly marked the colleges of
that section there has come a rivalry in dress and
ornaments carried to such an extent that some stu
dents wear jewels fitted for court ballrooms, and other
girls are tempted to steal them.
. The parents, the faculty and -the society that tol
erate a display of costly jewels' by college girls are
almost as much to blame for the foolish desire for
dress as was the silly girl who was caught by it and
fell. The moral duty of imposing restraint upon the
extravagance of the young must rest somewhere. It
will be a' badthing for New. England if the present
desire for a display of wealth corrupts her colleges
until they are no longer attractive to persons of
moderate means. "As matters stand at present parents
who cannot afford their daughters an elaborate array
of jewels and gowns to match for their college days
had better send them to Western colleges.
..Upon the showing thus made it is evident that the
,girl who stole the jewels is not the only fool in the
case. When young girlsat college wear diamond or
naments valued at $1500, and when gems and golden
jewelry are so common among the students that ar
ticles to the value of $5000 can be stolen by a single
thief, it is clear that college life at Smith is becoming
about as extravagant as that in the smart. set itself.
THE DESIRE, FOR DRESS.
RECENTLY a young woman of 21, the daughter"
of a family of eminence in New Jersey so
ciety and a student at Smith College, was '
arrested upon a charge of having stolen property |
from her fellow students. The girl is said to have
admitted the crime. .The value of the property stolen
is estimated at $5600^ Upward of fifty costly articles
of jewelry are missing, among them being a J diamond
ornament valued, at $1500. . ' ' .; / : :
With the exception' of her 'dishpnesty^the^young
woman is said to have an excellent character, and
her crime is attributed to desire, for dress. Orie re
port says: "It is known that she has pawned articles
in Springfield, Hartford, Philadelphia and New
Ydrk. It seems to be a clear case-of a foolish young
girl who desired to dress beyond her means and de^
liberately took the property of girls at the coliege,
pawned it and gratified her desires for luxurious'
living." â¢ â¢ : Â¦:%*!>
The .most . dominant and . unusual char
acteristic shown in all records of political
life at the beginning- of Â¦ the nineteenth
century Â¦ was - the Â¦ influence of jj French
ideas. These notions had been brought to
cities and to isolated homes; 1 both
sciously and: unwittingly, by soldiers of
the revolution, and they were held In dlf-,

munities. Americans had watched Â¦ with
alternating emotions the -entrance of the

The early century was a day of dueling.
Every gentleman In the South had met
his man. The story of Bladensburg-duel
ing field Is one of gloom. Dueling was
becoming almost as prevalent in the
North 'as in the South when the public
horror at the death of Alexander Hamil
ton by the hand of Aaron Burr caused a
great revulsion of feeling. Previous to
that tragedy New York had seen the
duels of Burr with John B. Church, of a
man named Eacker with Mr. Price. Then
Kacker killed Alexander Hamilton's old
est son, Philip, a youth of 19. Mr. Cole
man met Mr. Thompson; Mr. Riker met
one Swartwout, who had previously had
a meeting with De Witt Clinton, in which
five rounds of â¢ shots were exchanged,"
Clinton' wounding Swartwout each time
and the latter refusing to stop, until Clin
ton declared, he would not shoot again:
These duels were for the most trifling
causes. For Instance, Â¦ it was announced
that the "youth of the city" would meet
to address a letter of congratulation to
John Adams when he became President.
The next day an article appeared . in > a
newspaper -which' said the meeting was
presided over by "a stripling of 48 years,'
while Master Jemmy Jones, another boy
not quite 60, graced the assembly with his
presence." Jones .was deeply enraged at
this jocular sentence and sought out the
author, who Â¦ proved to be Judge Living
stone, the brother of Mrs.; Jay. Living-
Stone declared he was sorry to have given
offense, that he wrote it lightly. Jones
then, struck him- and tried .to pull his
nose. A challenge and duel followed, in
which Jones was instantly killed by a
shot in the heart. A settled gloom fell on
Livingstone, from: which, though he rose
to great* distinction, . he never recovered.''
In the Days of Dueling.
-This seemed so decisive that an annual
Inoculation was ordered in June, the time
of which should be posted in public
places, warned from house -to house, and
advertised in- the newspapers, and to
which strangers were invited. Due and
significant gratitude to God for "'so singu
lar and admirable a blessing" was shown
by permitting . the vaccination , to take
place in the meeting-house. The result
of all this was a law in Massachusetts
enforcing vaccination, and the loathsome
pest of smallpox never again .had a foot
hold in the State untilafter- the statute
was, unfortunately, repealed in 1836.

It Is interesting to see how quickly and
with what intelligence people accepted
vaccination. Dr. Waterhouse sent sever
al supplies of lymph to President Jeffer
son, who, with his son-in-law, vaccinated
over two hundred of their Virginia neigh
bors and servants. Whole towns turned
out to be vaccinated, a- hundred persons
a day. Circulars of invitation were read
in .the pulpit. As proof was desired by
some, twelve children, who had been suc
cess- fullyAyaccinated . were afterward in
oculated with' smallpox, and a public-spir
ited gentleman of Milton, Mr. Horton,
gave his house as a hospital. The charge
of twelvej,healthy children for two.weeks
must have kept him busy. At. the close
the children were â¢ discharged, .none of
them -having' taken- the smallpox; and
each was with a certificate, of

The most important reform of the early
years of the nineteenth century was the
establishment of temperance societies
.The first marked effect leading to this end
had been made by a tract ol Dr. Benja
min Rush of Philadelphia in 1S04 "An
Inquiry Into the Effect of Ardent Spirits
upon the Human Body and Mind." Ser
mons began to be preached on the sub
ject. In 180S a temperance society was
formed in Saratoga. The reform dragged
along slowly. Dr. Lyman Beecher In 1S01
sent an exhortation to a meeting of the
New York Synod. Other clergymen fol
lowed and other societies indorsed the
movement. .New societies were formedâ
"moral" societies, "farmer" societies
"abstinence" societies, temperance' soci
eties. Teetotal (a name adopted In 1833)
societies followed. Temperance tales were
printed. Reformed drunkards formed
Washingtonian societies, whose prophet
was John B. Gough. The cause had a lit

but, like all absolutely necessary reforms'

ed the Rutland Herald in 1794, a newspaper
which is still in existence. His son, the
Governor of Vermont, said: "There was
not at the time a lawyer from Middlebury
to Bennington who was a professor of
religion y or willing to be known as a friend
to Christianity; their offices were open on
the Sabbath. Multitudes frequented tne
taverns at Rutland, groups that rum and
infidelity brought together vying with
each other in blasphemy.'-'

the spread of French deism was the alter

Sunday:

In 1S10 the Postmaster General ordered
all postmasters who received mail on
Sunday to keep open offices, but his Puri

to travel quietly and in no way to <Ji\-ert

some zealots denounced exchanges of
ministers from town to town as violating
the Sabbath. Then Sabbath unions were
lormed and many reforms were effected.
Thus did public opinion waver.

was the most envied of men, and by the estimate- put
upon the importance of his position one would have
thought that he was speaking himself into immortal

and then a colonel speaks. Listen! He says the party
skies have a rosy tinge and that the people in more
than thunder tones are demanding "the gold that pol
ished the winged sandals of Hermes and the silver

Passing over to the Democratic national conven
tion, the proceedings read like the roster of the staff
ot an army with banners. There were colonels born
to the title, others who won it in the Union and Con
federate ranks, and still others who laid aside their
war harness as privates and had promoted them
selves. The bright, resplendent militia colonel was
there, and the members of the junior order of real
colonels created by the Spanish war. It is a stirring

unless Bryan were elected to turn the switch in time
to prevent the crash.
Then Major John Brown (colored), of Kansas also,
a veteran of the Cuban campaign, arose, and so did
the roof, when he pledged and plighted the colored
vote to the Silver Republicans. This black man was
followed by Mr. Crow of Dakota, and a long and

THE PASSING SHOW. 1
It is.not likely that any; of these schemes of bal
lot restriction will be accepted, but they are interest
ing as showing the diversity of Alabama sentiment on
the subject It will be seen that one of them would
exclude from the polls every citizen who cannot speak
English, which looks as if there were an anti-foreign
element in the State. '. The proposal that every man
who has a home shall have a vote shows that there is
some sense of appreciation of industrious and thrifty
negroes and a willingness. to let that class vote. ' The
proposal to give illiterates a colored ballot to count
for one-fourth vote is another evidence of the exist
ence of a glimmer of justice in the convention, for
while such a provision is riot Icommendable in it
self, it is certainly better than excluding educated
black men from the polls while admitting ignorant
white men.
The four bills referred to differ ( widely from one
another. One of them, submitted by Pillans' of Mo
bile, provides simply that no person shall be permitted
to vote or to register unless able to speak the Eng
lish language. Bulger of Tallapoosa would require
that all electors be able to read and understand the
constitution, but exempts from that requirement
every one who was a qualified voter January i, 1867.
Miller of Wilcox proposes a more elaborate system
of restriction. His plan makes qualifications as to
age, residence, education and taxable property to the
value of $300, exempts soldiers and descendants within
the fourth de'gree and persons who could vote in 1867
and their descendants within the second degree, fixes
1908 as the year in which all who offer to vote for the
first time' shall be possessed of the general qualifica
tions; also contains a poll tax clause and provides
that owners of homes shall be entitled to vote, irre
spective, of value. . '
An original and novel proposition was submitted by
Banks of Russell.. This plan, in addition to providing
a poll tax which must be paid as a preliminary to.vot
ing, disfranchising persons who sell their votes and
men who abandon their wives and children, contains
provision for a white and a colored ballot to be used
in all elections; ballot and booths are to be similar to
the Australian system, except that all electors who
can prepare their ballots without aid are to be given
ii (white ballot; those who need assistance in-prepar
ing the'ballot are tcbe given a colored ballot, but
are permitted to select their own marker; colored bal
lots count as one-fourth of a vote; lifter 1906 all per
sons coming into Alabama after' ratification of the
constitution and all who shall have become 21 years
of age in the meantime shall be 'able to read and write
before voting. â¢ -,

10 SUBSCRIBERS LEAYIKG TOWI FOR THE SUHMEB.7
FINE CHURCH EDIFICE TO BE ERECTED IN HOLY REDEEMER PAR
ISH, FROM THE PLAN OF CHARLES J. DEVLIN, THE" ARCHITECT.
THE AUDITORIUM WILL SEAT 800 PEOPLE^
The exhibits at Mechanics' Pavilion are
to comprise displays from the different
branches of Epworth League work, from
religious organizations, from the counties
of the State, from private business houses
and corporations and from the >rallroads.
The missionary exhibit will contain rep
resentatives of the different peoples
among whom missionary work has been
done, together with specimens of their
native arts and products. The Prune
Growers' Association will have many
unique figures made from prunes, with a
multitude of illustrations of the uses to
which the fruit may be put. The South
ern Pacific Railroad will have an excep
tionallv One exhibit of redwoods. The
Santa ~Fe will show specimens of various
interesting curios to be found along Its
route. It is expected also that there will
be a display furnished by the Chinese Six
Companies, and this" feature is particular
ly desired on account of the interest taken
by visiting Easterners in the Chinese of
the Pacific .Coast. Many of the largest
local mercantile houses are also planning
to assist in a typical California exhibit.
Tickets will be placed on sale at the
special Epworth League rate in Chicago
on July 6 and will be sold for eight cotir
secutive days. The majority of the Ep
worth Leaguers are expected to come di
rect to San Francisco and from this city
make excursions to surrounding towns.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Meth
odists of Los Angeles will hold a recep
tion, however, to the Epworth Leaguers
who pass through there only July 13 and
14 on their way to San Francisco.
The hotel men are all looking forward
to the visit of the Epworth League. At
the present time the hotels are not crowd
ed, and the hotel men say that they will
have ample accommodations to handle the
vast army that will arrive. A register
has also been made of all the private
houses where rooms can be secured.
The handling of the baggage will not
be given exclusively to one transfer com
pany. The committee of arrangements
has decided that the moving of the trunks
is too big an undertaking for one concern.
All the reputable transfer companies will
be asked to pool on the business.
There will be an absence of all these
inconveniences this year, if the arrange
ments that were made in the railroad
bunding yesjerday are carried out to the
letter. The baggage of the Epworth
Leaguers will be brought over from the
Oakland mole in a special boat and not.
as is usually the custom, on a ferry boat.
Upon arrlying on this side the trunks will
be piled in small lots and located accord
ing to numbers.
When the Christian Endeavorers were
here three years ago the handling of the
baggage was a disgrace to a city with
the facilities of San â¢ Francisco. Ths
trunks on this occasion accumulated by
the hundreds in one big pile,- which as
sumed the proportions of a mountain.
Many of the owners of the trunks were
unable to find them and those that did
locate their Saratogas were unable to se
cure them, as numbers of the trunks were
at the bottom of the. pile and could not
be reached. Numbers of the Christian
Endeavorers never received their trunks
until they had returned to their homes In
the East. Â¦ ' Â¦ ,
The handling of the baggage of 30.000
visitors is no small matter, and as that
number of Epworth League members are
expected to arrive here about July 10 for
the annual convention that takes place in
this city extensive arrangements were
made yesterday by the national officials
for the prompt delivery of their trunks
and valises.

Er. Buckley, Member of the Board of
Health, Characterizes Certain
Suggestions as Absurd.
Dr. V. P. Buckley, chairman of the
Health and Hospital Committee of the
Board of Health, sent a communication
to the Mayor yesterday anent the stric
tures on the management of the City and
County Hospital contained in the last
Grand Jury's report. Dr; Buckley han
dles, the inquisitorial body, without gloves
for making what he terms absurd sug
g-c-Etions. Among other things he says:
The puggeFtlon by the Grand Jury that con
valescent patients be made to cut up the trees
for lire wood is absurd. Persons strong enough
for that work are not kept in a hospital. The
puggestion that the election booths used by the
nurses be removed and the inclosure be . con
verted into a erassy lawn for the patients is
Impracticable. The pile of old iron complained
of had been there for many years and likely
will be for majiy more. No one will take It
away and we are considering the advisability
of digging a hole and burying It. Relative to
complaint about dogs, I will state that tho
assertion that they are annoyances to every
one and exist at the expense of the hospital
funds is not worthy of consideration.

Fourteen stained glass windows will af
ford abundance.of light in the auditorium
and add to the richness of the wall ef
fects. The sajictuary will be finished with
an elliptical coffer-paned ceiling and light
ed with three stained glass windows.
The entire edifice will be lighted
throughout by electricity. The interior
woodwork will be of yellow pine, var
nished and finished in the natural state.
The plastered walls and ceilings will be
tir-ted in such tones as to produce the
most harmonious effects. The building is
on classic lines of the Ionic style. The
height of the towero from sidewalk to the
top of the crosses is 90 feet. Charles J.
Devlin is the architect.
The parish is only six months estab
lished, and that so much progress has
been made is due to the earnestness and
i hard work of the Rev. Father Joseph P.
McQuaide, who is laboring earnestly to
raise the necessary funds to erect the
building.
Holy Redeemer Parish. Picnic.
The first social gathering of the congre
gation of the Holy Redeemer parish*of
the year will be held on next Saturday at

Headine Off Politicians.
The Building Trades Council has
adopted the following resolution:
TVithin the past few days the disturbed con
ditions exiFtinK between labor and capital have
Fupgest^d to eome persons connected with the
miscellaneous trades the advisability of turn
\r.e such conditions to political account in the
h<ipe that the difficulties now being experienced
Viotween employers and employees had reached
that Ftape of agitation that the latter could be
rrarshaled into convention and the entire
Ftrer.gth be utilized in the support of certain
interests and a certain set of candidates under
the banner of labor, the plan discussed being
Th(* apsc-mblir*^ of a labor convention, the *Â»e
lf-ction of candidates for political preferment
end the placing of such candidates upon the
ballot by r^tition.
With a few who are affiliated with some of
the m:sr-rllaneous trades this suKirestion met
v.- : th immediate approval, but the careful and
thinkir.ft majority constituting organized labor
fas df-oriel surh innovation and sternly op
r*>sps the participation in i>olitics by the or
panizatinns. as Â«n exclusive political labor
]>arty. This course has been pursued by all
letrUimate unions and has proven to be the only
rn f e m*-thod and the only method by which
labor has r*en able to support those in whom it
reitnued complete confidence regardless of par
t Ksnphip. thereby preserving and prot*c*.!ng'
ih* uni<-n against political division and bring
ing to thp public service the persons in whose
tatnfia the municipal government has been safe
fp.1 secure and labor'e interests have been pro
tertÂ«>d.
Th- nuil'iirijr Tramps Council represents many
t>T-'U! t r.n<ls of property owners and taxpayers,
vhn are as Jealous of their interests as any
rth*r affiliated body, be it commercial, mer
rant 1p. financial or any other body, and
realizes that the only way to properly Â«=ub
**-rw thoFP interests i* to affiliate with such
t>o<i!es in the support of safe and careful men
for p-jl.lir trusts. It has been found at all

rnd has been Fuccepsful net only In bringing to
ihf community rÂ«?w laws by which the whole
rrrrmuri!?y has benefited, but has also assisted
in placing the administration of those laws In
the hands rt safe and competent officials.
Jt is for this reÂ«son that the Building Trades
fnuricil '.f> unalterably opposed to. and Fternly
denounces any attempt on the part of any per
son or persons connected with orKanized labor.
t> orpsnize a so-called labor convention or party

AGEXERAI* summary of th$ situa
tion in the strike of the journey
men butchers shows that neither
?Ide has rained or lost.
Butcher shops are still doing
business, but with a crippled force. Peo
ple are petting meat as they did before
the day the journeymen butchers went
out. From the interior men are coming
to handle the slaughtered product. Deliv
ery wagons have to wait upon them only
for their lack of deftness. There the sit
uation ends.
Butcher shops throughout the city were
running during the day. People got meat.
The Journeymen Butchers mot at the
Turk-street Temple during the afternoon
nnd received reports that certain un
named slaughterers and owners of large
bands of cattle would be able to supply
for three weeks a sufficient quantity of
beef and mutton to satisfy all demands.
The Wholesale Butchers' Association
held a meeting yesterday afternoon in
the office of Miller & Lux for the purpose
of outlining a plan of future action.
After the meeting Attorney Frohman,
representing the wholesalers, said:
"The wholesalers intend to treat this
us a live issue. Day after day we labored
t<-Â» avoid the present difficulties. Even
jifter the Retail Butchers' Association pe
titioned us to protect them against the
labor unions we delayed taking precipi
tate action in the hope that the trouble
would eventually end.
Agreed to the Schedule.
"The assertion on the part of the strikers
that the wholesalers were attempting to
l.reak the backbone of the journeymen's
union is absolutely false, for retailers
agreed to the schedule submitted by the
men and the shops v.-cre declared fair.
Some of the dealers, hoping to aid their
business, displayed union cards. This dis
play was optional, according to the agree
ment. The journeymen distributed thou
rands of cards, calling upon the public to
patronize only those shops displaying the
union signs. This was a boycott. In Oak
land the journeymen called upon the
vholrsalers to keep the union cards in
their places of business and that drew the
wholesalers into the fight.
"The retailers then made their appeal to
us. They peremptorily demanded that we
protect them from the unjust boycott
vhich was being levied against them by
ihe labor unions. Assistance was granted,
becaii?e if the butchers were forced to
submit to the domination of the unions, no
restaurant, no bakery nor individual could
hold out arainst their demands. They
could shut off the necessaries of life and
have us all at their mercy."
Abattoirs Are Idle.
Abattoirs at Butchertown, Berkeley,
Oakland and other places in the imme
diate vicinity of the bay are idle, but it is
not expected that this condition will last
long. The employing butchers, acting
ss a unit, have decided not to give meat
to any shop having union affiliations. As
the sunply of the various butcher shops
throughout this city and elsewhere re
mains in their hands the journeymen ap
parently have to override this situation.
It may be further stated that unless a re
cession is made regarding demands the
people of the city will experience the
meat famine predicted a few days ago.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the Journeymen Butchers' Association
was held last night to consider matters
effecting the strike. The meeting was
harmonious but failed to develop results.
A disposition was manifested to avoid
meeting the issue directly. A conference
of the Journeymen Butchers will be held
to-day at the Turk-street Temple.
IX the matter of the strike of the iron
workers no change was observable
yesterday. Headquarters has been
established at Third and Brannan
streets for the machinists' helpers.
It Is estimated that between all the
unions whose members are out on strike
about 6000 men are concerned. The wages
of the men. according to the various
branches of trade in which they are em
ployed, vary from $1 50 to $5 a day. A
conservative estimate of "the amount of j
wages now being lost by the strikers and |
others places the amount approximately
at $300.<XK>.
The Metal Trades Association has is
sued a Ptatement through George E. Dow
In which is laid down the conditions upon
which the individual grievance of each
man will be adjusted. The most striking
paragraphs of the announcement are con
tained in the following extracts:
Disapproving absolutely of strikes and lock
outs, the members of the association will not
arbitrate any question with men on strike.
Neither will this afsiriatinn countenance a
lockout on any arbitrable question unless ar
bitration has failed.
Employment â No discrimination will be made
against any member of any nociety or or
ganization. Every workman who elects to
work in a shon will be required to work peace
ably and harmoniously with all his fellow em
ployes.
Apprentices, helpers and handy menâ The
number of apprentices, helpers and handy men
to bft employed will be determined s5lely by
the employer. i
Cooks' and Waiters' New Officers.
At the semi-annual election of the Pa
cific Coast Waiters' Association, the first
organization of cooks and waiters on this
coast, the following officers were elected
and will be instal'ed at a smoker to be

Musicians Indorse Strike.
At a meeting of the Musicians' Union,
â¢which was held yesterday afternon at
Golden Gate Hall, the strike of the Cooks
and Waiters was indorsed. M. Davis and
P. J. Johannsen, delegates who had been
sent by the local union to attend the con
vention of the National Federation of
Musicians, which was held at Denver,
rendered their report.
Stationary Engineers Meet.
Delegations from the Teamsters and
Steamfitters addressed the Stationery En
gineers last night at their meeting place,
1159 Mission street. T. Westoby. the na
tional organizer, was present.
CHICAGO MACHINISTS WIN.
Six Firms Make a Settlement With
Their Striking Employes.
CHICAGO, June 13.â A break occurred
to-day in the ranks of the Chicago ma
chinery manufacturers whose employes
are on strike. Six firms employing 1.13
men reached a settlement with their strik
ing machinists and the men will return
to work to-morrow under am agreement
securing to them the nine-hour day and
an increase in wages acceptable to the
CIXCIXXATI. June 13.â The Machinists'
Union of Covington. Ky.. sent a letter
to Governor Beckham in which thfy ap
peal for an investigation of the action of
Professor J. P. Anderson of the Kentucky
State College, who, they claim, is sending
students from the mechanical department
of the college to Cincinnati to take the
places of the striking machinists. The of
ficers of the union assert that ten students
are now at work in various shops in Cin
cinnati, and that they are working with
out any pay whatever.
CAPTAIN LZAIiE GIVES
PLEASANT BAY EXCURSION
Jolly Crowd on Steamer Caroline
Extends Greeting to the Bat
tleship Oregon.
Captain Leale's stanch little craft, the
Caroline, carried a gay crowd around the
bay last night. The jolly skipper asked
his friends to come with him and cele
brate the return of the battleship Oregon,
and a celebration it was in every respect.
For fully an hour the Caroline steamed
about the "pride of the navy." From the
decks of the little steamer was wafted the
strains of sweet music, which roused to
life the jackies occupying: soft spots on
the deck of the "bulldog." Three hearty
cheers for the Oregon were given by the
passengers on the Caroline. They were
answered with three ringing ones from
the battleshir>.
Billy Hinds was on the Caroline and gav.i
his famous "Laughing Song" and was
heartily applauded by the bluejackets.
He was followed by Homer Henley, who
rendered "The Holy City" with much suc
cess.
As a parting salute the choruses of sev
eral popular ditties were then sung by
Captain I^eale's passengers.
The Caroline then steamed for its berth
at Jackson-street wharf. On the return
trip light refreshments were served.
Those who made the trip were loud in
their nraises of Captain Leale's hospital
ity.

NEW YORK, June 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's Londcn financial cablegram says:
The reduction of the bank rate to-day from
ZVt to 3 per cent caused general surprise, for
although the increasing ease ,in money fore
shadowed the possibility of such action, it was
not generally expected that a reduction would
be actually made to-day. The stock market's
view of the matter Is that the bank directors
have anticipated . an early peace in the Boer
war. But the easy condition both of the bank
and stock market affords ample, explanation
of to-day's action. . â¢ Â¦

Chicago Livestock Market.
NEW YORK, June 13.â Reports from corre
spondents of R. G. Dun & Co. in the principal
Eheep raising States indicate that the season
has been most satisfactory, both as to size
and condition of clip, but complaints of prices
are very general. On many ranches the shear
ing is about completed and a yield somewhat
larger than the one preceding Is assured. -At
far Western, points there is much wool still
on the sheeps' backs, but animals are healthy
and no difficulty Is anticipated. v Not only Is
the quantity larger this season but the quality
Is better and wool so much cleaner that tosses
in scouring will be less than usual. A few re
ports indicate that growers have already sold
much of their wool.' but in the majority of
cases there is no desire to accept current prices.
This is especially true of the wealthier ranch
owners who can afford to hold their product.
Buyers are not alarmed by the tendencyto re
fuse offers which are about a cant lower than
a month ago and express.the opinion that still
easier, terms may be secured later. Consider
ing current stocks at the East and conditions
in the manufacture, prospects for higher prices
are not encouraging, notwithstanding the
decline of the past year.. ,

NEW YORK, June 13.â There was a notable
increase in the speculation in stocks to-day, the
day's business running up to near a million
Fharcs. Speculative interest was etlll decidedly
f potty, but the strength of the principal stocks
v.as so de-ided as to uSeet the whole list by
Fympathy with a few unimportant exceptions.
There were points in the list, nevertheless,
v.hich were held back by palpable realizing.
The realizing was well taken and inflicted no
jnÂ«es no thÂ«? stocks. Pennsylvania was a not
able example in this category and the South
western did not ehare to the full in the buoy
ancy of- other Western railroads. Very large
Exeunt* of stork have been marketed this
week and in the loan crowd the stock com
lnands a premium. The Felling is to a large
Â«-xtfnt against the buying of rights to subscribe
t* the new stock issues. Notwithstanding the
bCfldal disclaimers of the purchase of Pennsyl
vania StppI Company by the railroad company
V.'all street opinion regards that as an accom
plished fact. The continued strength to-day of
â¢"â¢-Â¦â¢iorado FupI and the buying cf that stock by
F om(! brokers usual!)- employed by the Gould in
freFtj: aroused a conjecture that the control cf
the Colorado Company was being sought by the
'Jould-Harriman Interest with the same purpose
in view as that ascribed to th* Pennsylvania,
namely, to insure the cheap production of its
ft<-Â«?l-rai! supply.
Th* advance in Colorado Fuel reached SÂ»4.
rr.rrying it above yesterday's higher price. In
dr-pendem wteel companies were strong, notably
*F< rmeEs-pe Coal, wjhich rose 3% on the acquisi
tion of the Alabama Steel and Wire Company.
ThÂ» I'nitM States SteÂ«>l stocks were h^avy. the
f^Ilir.s b*>:ng attributed to the uneasinw-s over
;i,,Â» development of opposition companies. The
Â«5Â»u:d-Hsr"riman brokers were active in various
Ftr.rKs. notaMy in Union Pacific. The buying
in this Ft<vk was en an enormous scale and whs
ir!<>wly follow**', by St. Paul throughout all its
tfuotualions. The Ftr^et was In the dark as to
tttf> oa-iisf of Lbe movement and attributed it
ragaeSy to further working out of the North
v.-ri-tern Railroad relations and to favorable
rrrw Dewy. A well defined rumor gained cur
rÂ»-nf4' toward t!;? Hose that some heavy original
iviMinss of St. Paul, represented in the direc
tory for many j-Vare. have been sold and that
tl;p stock will appear in the collateral for the
Vr.ion Pacific convertible bonds. I'nion Pacific
r<ve an r-xtr'-me C'i. and Ft. Paul 4?Â». Missouri
I'aoif:.- an'l some of its affiliated stocks, notably
IMWCT and Rio Orande. continued to f=h"Â»w the
litfloeaoc "f exxweted action on consolidation.
Tbe rise in Baltimore and Ohio of 3'i was on
the Sudirial doeiFion In favor of the rights of
the common stockholders to all profits after the
pflym'-m of the dividend. The F.to<-k broke two
point* from the tame cause. Cleveland, C. C.
jiv/1 H; Louis advanced 2*i on the reported ac
<;nÂ«:iiiori of the Cincinnati Northern.
Minne-Pi>o!ls and St. l>ouis. after a further
r<eri\nr- 'A one point, owlnp to disappointment
over ye?tÂ«r<iay's unchanged dividend, rallied
Ftronply fitn Â«ne to two points. The buoyant
r.iithuryt in 1'nion Pacific made the closing firm.
BllbOBgti thpre had b;en constant reactions on
I rffit-i.ikinff.
Several convertible bond issues were strong
zvA active in response to the movement of tholr

New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, June 13.â The volume of trade
was not large. With Liverpool cables reflect
ing the conditions- existing here yesterday and
with a continuation .of favorable weather to
day's wheat market invited a decline. Â«hjly
opened r shade to U@%c lower at 7OV4@7O%c,
with liberal offerings and slight demand except
for the professional class. Under a. continua
tion of liquidation the price declined to 69*4c,
the lowest of the day, and then came a re
action based on reports of damage by fly and
New York reports of a continuance of the con
tinental demand. July rallied to 71@71^c. at
which It closed steady and Vic higher. Advices
that unexpectedly favorable conditions existed
in the corn belt, and the selling of nearly
1,000.000 bushels by the bull leader, caused an
early weakness in the corn pit. The volume
of trade was moderate. Late in the session
there was considerable buying back at slightly
improved prices on local cash ' demand. July
closed fairly steady and %@ t ,Jc lower at 41%
(542c. Â» â¢ .
Perfect weather conditions and the weakness
of corn was the bear feature to-day In oats.
July closed steady and %c down at 27%c.
Provisions were weak early, but lard and
ribs Mater became firm on buying by packers.
July pork closed 10c lower, lard 2^i@5c down
and ribs unchanged.

Tramps.
Fire broke out in an unoccupied dwell
ing house in the rear of 1410 Fol-som
street last" night and for a time a serious
blaze was imminent. Alarms were turned
in from boxes 78 and 79 and the Fire De
partment was promptly on the scene and
prevented the spread of the flames. The
fire was haTd to get at, owing to blind
alleys and the closeness of the adjoining
buildings. Before the flames were got un
der control the Swedish Baptist Church
on Tenth street was in flames. The in
terior of the sacred edifice was flooded
with water and was damaged by the
flames. For a time St. Joseph's Church
was in danger.
According to James Murphy, who owns
the house that was destroyed, the place
was unoccupied. He states that his fam
ily had retired and he was awakened
from a sound sleep by his neighbor's
warnings. He believes some tramps set
fire to the house. The structure was in
sured. ... _
A newly erected house owned by Dr.
Stealey was partly damaged by the
flames. The household-belongings of Mrs.
Swi.ns.on and C. R. Gardilious were dam
aged by smoke and water. Mr. Gardilious
had just moved in and intended taking
his bride, whom he marries to-morrow, to
his new home. He says he was not in
sured. _ . ..
When the alarm of fire was given the
Teamsters' Union was holding a meeting
in Teutonia Hall, a block away. Some
member said J. B. Cole's stable was on
fire, and in a few seconds a motion to ad
journ was made and carried. The mem
bers rushed to the fire, and on finding
that the stable was safe proceeded to
save the church property. The teamsters
carried out organs, desks, tables and oth
er paraphernalia in quick time, and it is
due to their presence that the loss to the
Swedish Baptist Church will be lessened.

Suggestions have been advanced that
the organization could add largely to its
strength of membership If assurance were
given that certain aspirants for office
would receive the support of the league

to give anti-boss Republicans a common

BONES OF MISSIONARIES
DISCOVERED BY SOU3IERS
Remains of the Men Captured and
Eaten by Cannibals in New

VICTORIA, B. C, June 13.â The story
of the massacre of the Rev. James Chal
mers, Prof. Tomkins and fourteen native
teachers at the mouth of the Aird River,
in New Guinea, by cannibals, ( was
brought by the steamer Miowera. \ The
missionaries had gone on the schooner
Niue to Aird River, and on the arrival of
tht> schooner 100 canoes came alongside,
their occupants being all armed with
bows, arrows, spears and clubs. Despite
the warlike appearance of the natives the
missionaries landed, and after their boat
turned around a small mango clump they
were not seen again from the schooner.
A force of Australian artillery was sent
to investigate, and on their arrival were
attacked by the natives, whom they drove
oft and followed into the bush, taking and
destroying ten villages. Some of the prls r
oneis taken stated that when the mission
aries left their schooner they were taken
up a creek and surrounded by. a party of
natives. Chalmers was caught by the
arm and dragged toward the village,
which was within fifty yards. He was
then clubbed and his head was cut off
with bamboo knives in sight of Tomkins
and other members of the party. Chal
mers' body was cut and eaten the same
day. Tomkins was kept till the next day.
After Tomkins had been killed the mem
bers of the native mission crew were
killed and their flesh was distributed
among ten villages. The scene where
Chalmers was eaten was found, together
with parts of clothing, a jawbone with
teeth and some thigh bones.

; BERLIN, June 13.â The report of '' the

press as being high-handed and denying
private property rights in war, against
the practice and- theory of all , civilized
countries. The German Government has

meditated against a large number of Ger

pears certain or even likely that the.Brit

Speakers From Foreign Climes.
The church in all ases has been inclined to
limit the family of God and especially to be
lieve that no new children could be born into
it. Narrow-minded members of every sect
have been inclined to consign all besides them
selves- to the uncovenanted mercies of God.
They have often prided themselves on their
hoarlness and antiquity and they have looked
askance upon a new organization as an in.
terloper that had no right to gather around
the family table. It 'was bo with the Sunday
school,' It waÂ» so especially with the Young
Men's Christian Association, but by llfty years
of faithful work in thousands of communities
It has proved its divine origin and Its right
to be counted In the family ot God. The Young
Men's Christian Association is the church at
work for young men, not this church or that.
A reception by the Governor at the
State House followed. Franklin W.
Smith of Washington presided at the
afternoon exercises in the Old South
Church.
"The Relations of the Young Men's
Christian Association to the Church" was
the theme of Dr. Clark's address. He
said in part:
Grand Work of Fifty Years.
Rev. . F. E. Clark, president of the
United Society of Christian Endeavor, the
next speaker, was given a reception which
had in it all the Christian Endeavor
warmth and enthusiasm. It was some
minutes before he was allowed to speak.
At to-day's session of the Young Men's
Christian Association convention the first
speaker was Cephas Brainerd of New
\ork, whose topic was "The Fundamental
Principles of the Young Men's Christian
Association.". Mr. Brainerd dealt almost
exclusively in statistics' and a review of
the growth of the organization..
The second speaker was President W. H.
P. Faunce of Brown University, who pre
faced his remarks by saying that he
brought the greeting of the little State of
Rhode Island ' and the university, 137
years old, which is deeply interested in
the work of the association. '
BOSTON,' June 13.â The great j enthu
siasm created yesterday during the meet

shots were fired by the murderer, both
bullets passing through the body of Tou.
The murderer, after committing the
deed, turned and ran up St. Louis alley
and disappeared. The weapon with which
he did the shooting was found at the
head of the alley. : It was the regulation
highbinder revolver, long barreled and of
38 caliber.
The murderer was seen running from
the scene of his crime by a number of
Chinese lounging about the locality. They
made no effort to prevent his escape, and
when questioned later by the police offi
cers displayed their usual stolid taciturn
ity.
The murdered man was not very well

as to his Identity led to the disclosure oC
nothing but his name and occupation.
The cause of the shooting is a mystery.
Police officers have no knowledge of
â¢which tong-. If any. You Sing belonged to

Cpmplaint Charging Him
With Perjury Will i Be
Piled To- Day. v;
The jury in the case, of "Sir" Harry
Westwood Cooper* alias Ernest Moore
Chadwlck,' charged with forgery in send
ing a forged telegram to Miss Norine
Schneider, after being out all night, came
into Judge Cook's court yesterday morn
ing and the foreman, H. K. Waterhou3e,
announced' that the members had been
unable to .agree upon a verdict. The
Judge asked. whether it was a matter of
fact. or- of law and the foreman replied
that it was on a matter of fact as to
whether the telegram had been sent, with
intent to defraud. The Judge said hÂ«
could not advise them and discharged
them. The case was then: set for to-mor
row, when it will be reset for the second
trial. The jury on the first ballot stoou
6 to 6. A second ballot stood 7 for convic
tion and 5 for acquittal and no change was
made.
After the jury was discharged Attorney
Murphy for the defendant asked the court
to order Mrs. . Schneider and her two
daughters into custody on the charge of
perjury. He declared that they perjured
themselves by testifying that no engage
ment existed between the defendant and
Miss Norine Schneider. T\.e Judge replied
that the fact of the engaeement was not a
material point In the case and declined to
take any action.
District Attorney Byington will file the
complaint charging Cooper with perjury,
as instructed by the Judge, to-day. The
charge is based upon the testimony of
Cooper that he had a private conversation
with Miss Norine Schneider on the even
ing of February 22, when it was arranged
between them that he should send her the
forged .telegram. That'. Is a material
point in the case.
Stands Seven for Convic
tion and Five for
. ' Acquittal. -
JURY IN COOPER
CASE DISAGREES
Owingf-to the fact that the overcrowded
detention shed at the Mall dock is. not in
good sanitary, condition, ; Collector Strat
ton released Su Shih Chin on. cash bail
given .by his custodians, the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, last Wednesday, and
the : Chinese reformer, has comfortable
quarters among his own people. â¢ v â¢
He appeared before the Collector yester
day "to show cause why he should not be
deported. | The Dowager , Empress v.', of
China was represented -by her Imperial
Majesty's Consul General, Ho Yow. .Con
sul Ho objected to the admission: to. this'
country of Su on two grounds. , First, that
his section 6 certificate, describing him as
a traveler, had been obtained from a repre
sentative of the Chinese Government '.by
fraud and misrepresentation, and -second
that the paper was informal because there
was an unfilled blank in it. ' '-Â¦'Â¦' .
The transcript of 'the proceedings -r-wlll
be mailed to the Secretary of the Treas
ury as soon as prepared and Su will be de
tained here until the; Secretary passes
upon the case. .
The friends of Su are sanguine as to the
result. They say that if the worst hap
pens and Su should be deported to' Shang
hai, whence he came, he will be under the
protection of the British flag and can ob
tain, a Â¦ certificate Â¦ from â¢ the registrar., at
that port, which will entitle him to land
here. â¢ Â¦â¢'â¢'- Â¦.;-.,Â¦
Several hundred red circulars/in Chinese
characters were circulated in Chinatown
yesterday afternoon announcing that Su
would speak to the Chinese people of this
city in the Washington-street theater at
7 o'clock in the evening on the subject,
"Past, Present and Future of China."
Ho Tow will file a copy and translation
of the circular to-day with the Collector
-as an evidence that Mr. Su is not a
tralever, but a lecturer. < .- Â¦ ' ..

COUNTEKFEIT DIE IS
RENDERED HARMLESS
George T. McDonnell's Counsel Ar
gues That tho Government Failed
' . to Present a Case.
George T. McDonnell was placed on
trial yesterday in the United. States Did
trlct Court before Judge do Huven and a
Jury. Duncan K. McKlnlay. Assistant
United States District Attorney, appeared
for the Government and Bert Schlesinger
for the defendant.
The testimony was to tho effect that
McDonnell. Chimes Koenlg and Dewltt
E. Young procured to be made a steel die
for the coining of one-dollar pieces. The
impression, however, did not seem to be
a success, for it was filed off before any
money was stamped and the die remained
blank. Mr. Schlesinger argued that ths
die being blank there was no case against
his client. Mr. McKinlay tookithe ground
that a complete die had been made and
that the offense for which McDonnell had
been Indicted had been committed, and
that the subsequent erasure by filing did
not relieve the offender of culpability.
The case will be given to the Jury this
morning.
The preliminary examination of Charles
Kewitz. charged with making a die for
counterfeiting money, was held yesterday
before United States Court Commissioner
Heacock. Thomas D. Riordan, counsel for
the defendant, raised tho point that as
only half a die was found by the officers
Kewitz had not committed the offense of
making a. die. This case went over until
to-day to allow Mr. Riordan an opportu
nity of producing authorities.
President Charles M. Hays of the
Southern Pacific and General Manager
Kruttschnitt are racing to New York.
Why they are in such a hurry to reach
the Eastern metropolis is a question as
yet unsolved by those in the yellow build
ing. . "
When they left here on Monday even
ing Hays and Kruttschnitt each had his
private car attached to the train. It was
first planed that Kruttschnitt should
travel only as far as Ogden and then re
turn to San Francisco, inspecting the road
on his way. The plans were changed,
however, and when the special arrived at
Ogden Kruttschnitt's car was uncoupled
from the train and was sent back to this
city, while the general manager boarded
the president's car and, sped on eastward.
' The special is rushing forward at top
speed, which causes old railroad men to
shake their heads and mutter, "There Is
something in, the wind."' Hays and
Kruttschnitt will hold a conference with
President Bert of the Union Pacific at
Omaha and will then journey on to New
York. . â¢ . ,
: A prominent railroad official, in speak
ing , of Hays' trip East, said yesterday
that on the return of the railroad presi
dent to this city there will be some big
changes in the Southern Pacific. He re
marked: Â¦ .
"I feel positive that the trip East is for
a conference between Hays and.Harrlman
in â¢ reference â¢ to â¢ curtailing expenses.-: -I
think that a closer consolidation will 1 be
made between the Union and Southern
Pacific^.roads. Take, for Instance the
land departments of the Southern Pacific
and 'Union Pacific. I would not- be the
least surprised to hear that the two offices
will be consolidated at once and the head
quarters-moved to Omaha, with a small
branch - maintained here." â¢ .'
J. C. Stubbs is still in New Tork and
there has been no indication of his re
turn to San Francisco. It is more than
possible that he will await the coming: of
Hays. *
. H. E. Fitzhugh has taken up his duties
as assistant to President Hays. He has
not been allotted an office in the railroad
building, but; his letters are delivered on
the executive floor, all his official letters
being addressed. "H. B. Fitzhusrh, Assist

HAYS HURRYING
TO NEW YORK
A notice which was served on Auditor
"Wells yesterday by the attorneys of the
First. National Bank and John W. Mack
ay will result in tying up indefinitely the
surplus fund of the present year, which
has been apportioned b'y the Supervisors
to pay _ back claims of merchants, and
teachers against tho city. Tho notice is
in effect n protest against the proposed
intention to pny other creditors, whereas
no provision has been made in tho budget
to liquidate tho clnlms of the two protest
ants named, which claims have boon put
in final judgment.
The nmoiint? involved include a Judg
ment for $10,488 09 ngnlnat the city for
taxes paid under protest and since ad
judged to be Illegal, and three more Judg
ment claims of tho same character hold
by J. W.'i Mackay for, respectively,
$1284 84, $19,063 Co and $15,138 44. The notices
served on the Auditor are four in num
btr, one of which ls as follows: ,
We herewith present to you a transcript of
the docket of the final judgment given and
made by the Superior Court of the city and
county of San Francisco on the 11th day of
August, 1900, In the action then pending in said
court, numbered 54,339, and wherein John W.
Mackey et al., trustees, etc., were plaintiffs,
and the city and county of San Francisco was
defendant. â¢
And we hereby notify you that the principal
amount- of said judgment bears interest at the
rate of 7 per cent per annum from the date of
rendition until paid; and. we hereby demand
and require of you the allowance and payment
of the amount of Bald Jud&ment and interest'
thereon out of the "surplus fund" in the treas
ury of the city and county of San Francisco
for the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1901; and you
are notified, requested and required to retain
at all times and until such allowance and pay
ment a sufficient amount of the moneys coming
and to come into said '"surplus fund" to pay
the said Judgment and the interest thereon as
aforesaid. - ' \ - .. Â¦ . Â¦ .. Â¦Â¦
Concerning the protests Auditor Wells
says that although the charater. specific
ally provides that final judgments .shall
be paid out of the surplus fund he will
decline to pay the judgments of the two
Protestants unless directed to. do -so. by.
the Board of ; Supervisors or by an- order
of court. The budget is now. in the hands
of the Mayor, who has informed the at
torneys for Mackay and the bank that no
provision has been made for. their pay
ment. The budget will not be -finally
adopted â¢ until the last' Monday in June,
and If the Supervisors refuse to provide
relief in the premises the attorneys will
immediately secure a restraining order on
the Auditor. . -, ...

THE Grand Circle of the Druld
esses, U. A. O. D. of California,
will hold its annual session in the
Sutter-street Druids' Temple on
Tuesday next. The authority to
institute the Grand Circle, the ladies'
branch of the United Ancient Order ,of
Druids, -vfas obtained last- year through
the efforts of Supreme Representative
WILL TIE UP
SURPLUS FUND
James F. MartinonI from the Supreme
Grove of the United States and was the
first charter issued to institute such a
body. The Grand Circle was organized
a few months ago and there are now nine
circles that owe allegiance to it. Three
more are ready to come in.
The present grand arch druidess, Mrs.
Thornhill, will retire from office and she
will be followed by Mrs. A. Sorensen of
Mistletoe Circle. Modesto, who will be
elected to the highest office for the term
of one year. .Miss Bessie Fabb-ri of El
Dorado Circle of this city, the grand sec
retary, will be a candidate for re-election,
and 'as her-.work : for the order and the
Grand' Circle 'has been satisfactory, it is
probable that- she will be continued in of
fice. There will be quite a number of
candidates for the other offices, but as
the members of the grand body are quite
new at the business of Grand Circle work
they have not yet made their selections
for the other positions.
Much work will be necessary during the
coming-year in the line of official visita
tions, arranging: for the establishment of
new circles; and their Institution and also
in the installation of new officers.
Army officers stationed in this city were
unanimous in expressing their indignation
yesterday of the alleged "army frauds"
developed by a "yellow" morning paper,
aided by an equally saffron-hued evening
contemporary.
Investigations made yesterday show
that in the entire city a little more than
$400 worth of soldiers' clothing and sup
pliea had been found in the second-hand
stores and pawn shops. Army officers are
of opinion that possibly a similar amount
of army clothing might have been hidden
away by some of the dealers, who became
alarmed at the fear of prosecution at the
hands of the Government.
In the last three years more than 75,000
soldiers have passed through this city,
either going to or returning from the
Philippines, and it has not been an un
common thing for the soldiers to sell or
pawn portions of their equipment.
, A number of pawnbrokers were prose
cuted at the outbreak of the war for hav
ing soldiers' clothing in their possession
and the recent presence of thousands of
fighting men led to a renewal of the
licit traffic in Uncle Sam's property.
â¢ Will Prosecute Dealers.
The fact that army shoes were adver
tised for sale by second-hand dealers In
this city led to a request being- made by
Inspector General Maus of General Shat
ter's staff that the United States District
Attorney, Marshall B. Woodworth, prose
cute the principal dealers in the goods.
,.The sensational morning newspaper that
published the story of "big army frauds"
was engaged at the same time in looking
for opium smokers in a low resort of the
city and evidently indulged in a "pipe
dream" at the expense of the reputation
oj the nation's gallant army.
After a search of all the second-hand
stores and pawnshops in the city, the In
spector general, aided by city detectives,
"rounded up" a quantity of Government
property and placed it In a warehouse.
The "yellow" papers, dazzled by the
prospect of securing for once a genuine
item of news, lost, their senses and dis
covered a "warehouse filled with stolen
clothing belonging to the army.".
The number of soldiers who have In the
last three years sold some of the cloth
ing Issued to them by the Government, as
compared to the total of the number quar
tered in San Francisco, is so small that It
would require decimal fractions to express
the percentage. - Â¦>
The "round-up" of Uncle Sam's prop
erty in the second-hand stores and pawn
shops this week shows that eleven
blankets were found, together with five
leggings, one blouse, forty-eight blue
flannel shirts, two gauntlets, seventy
eight pairs of black shoes and fifty-three
pairs of tan shoes.
Army Officers Indignant.
General Shatter was indignant yester
day on reading certain published state
ments reflecting on the honor of the of
ficers of the army in the Department of
California and his views were shared by
every -member of his staff.
Lieutenant Colonel M. P. Maus, Inspect
or general of the department, was em
phatic in denouncing the yellow publica
tions as an outrage.
Accused Dealers Silent.
"No charges have been filed against any
one in the army," he said, "and none will
be. No frauds have been committed, and
it is outrageous that the honor of the
army should be so grossly attacked.
Statements like those published will hurt
the city also. We knew that certain deal
ers were advertising Government clothing
and sought to bring the parties to justice.
No one in the army was accused, and we
did not know how these dealers came into
possession of the goods. We assumed that
the property had been sold by- some of
the soldiers while quartered In this city.
The traffic In clothing is Injurious to the
health and morale of the army, and it
will have to stop. From now on regular
search will be made for pawned clothing
belonging to the Government and it will
bo seized. This will serve to prevent the
dealers and pawnbrokers from doing busi
ness with the soldiers. Men have been
known to sell their supplies a few days
after receiving the same, and we could
not send the men "to the Philippines un
equipped. We had to replace the articles
they disposed of previous to their sailing
from this port."
Lipman Abrams and his son, George
Abrams, who were arrested on Tuesday
night for having soldiers' clothing and
supplies in their possession, were ques
tioned yesterday by the United States
District Attorney. The arrested men re
fused to give the names of the soldiers
from whom they had bought the goods
or give any Information In the matter
untll> they had consulted an attorney. Ike
Abrams is still at large and the police are
searching for htm. The bail of the ac
cused men has been fixed at $5000.
Captain A. W. Klmball, post quarter
master at the Presidio, denounced the
story of frauds In his department as a
pure fabrication. He stated that there
was no Irregularity in his department and
that a careful system of checking sup
plies prevented anything of the kind.
"The goods found in the pawnshops,"
said Captain Kimball, "were sold by dis
charged soldiers. AH clothing issued to
troops at the Presidio was from this of
fice. I have receipts of various officers
for clothing Issued to their regiments on
requisition, and these receipts, with the
balance of clothing on hand, tallies with
the amount received from. the depot quar
termaster." - : .
Colonel Rawles. commandant at the
Presidio/ characterized the stories of
army frauds as "perfect -rot." The of
ficer stated that it was well known that
the soldiers sold their clothing, and that
when evidence was secured steps had al
ways been taken to punish the seller and
the purchaser.
Colonel W. M. Wallace of the Fifteenth
Cavalry, stationed at the* Presidio, stated
that the stories of fraud were, absurd
He ridiculed the statements that gTeat
quantities of soldiers' clothing had been
purchased by secord-hand dealers.
Many officers at the Presidio and those
on duty ac army headquarters In the Phe
lan building also expressed themselves In
positive terms to the effect that the al
leged "army frauds" existed only in the
columns of sensational papers.
James K. Ross, an attorney of the local
bar, will be cited this morning by Judge
Kerrigan to appear and show cause why
he should not be punished for contempt of
court for having placed In' the hands of
his client, Thomas F. Kollman, what pur
ported to be a copy of a decree of'divlrce,
under the provisions of which Kollman
believed he was a "widower." Kollman.
was cited on the 11th inst, to appear this
morning before Judge Kerrigan and show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court for failing to pay At
torney O. C. Pratt, who represents Mrs.
Kollman, counsel fees in the sum of $50
to enable Mrs. Kollman to prosecute her
cross complaint in the suit instituted by
"her husband.
Kollman's idea of a cross-complaint in
the case was hazy, and as he believed that
he had secured a decree of divorce and
had therefore divested his wife of the
right to "prosecute" he instituted an in
vestigation. The records in the office of
the County Clerk showed that no decree
had been issued in his case and that, fur
thermore, his default had been entered
to the cross-complaint tiled by his wife,
which bars him irom making further de
fense to her action.
The result was that Kollman plac'ed the
copy of the alleged decree of divorce pur
porting to free him from his wife in the
hands of Judge Kerrigan. The order di
recting him to' appear and show cause
why he should not be punished for con
tempt was also placed in the hands of the
court, together with a remarkable agree
ment that bears the signature of his at
torney, Ross. This agreement reads:
SAN FRANCISCO, April 23, 1901.
I hereby guarantee that on payment of the
full sum of $100 I will procure a divorce
for Thomas V. K/llman, and that there will be
no more trouble or no more money demanded
by me; that same shall be in full of all de
mands. JAS=. K. ROSS.
Acting upon these papers Judge Kerri
gan will call upon Ross to appear and
make his defense.
Regarding, the manner in which he had
been deceived, Kollman, who conducts a
barber shop on Pacific street, near Hyde,
said:
"I brought suit against my wife last
April, in which 1 asked for a decree of
divorpe on the grounds of cruelty and de
sertion. My attorney entered into the
agreement which is in the possession of
Judge Kerrigan and I paid him part of
the sum on account. 'The case was called
for hearing and I testified as to my wife's
desertion and cruel treatment of me. A
few days after the case was tried Attor
ney Ross called upon me to pay. the bal
ance due him and said that upon such
payment I would get my decree.
â¢ "I got my mother to advance me the
money and I paid the balance, for which
I- hold a receipt, and Attorney Ross gave
me a copy of the decree, which he said
had been issued in my favor, at the same
time saying. 'Now you are a widower.'
"I believed that I was divorced until a
few days ago, when I was served with the
copy of this order to show cause why I
should not be punished for contempt of
court. I went to see my lawyer. He said
that he had done all he had agreed to do
for me and refused to have anything fur
ther to do with the case. I was informed,
however, that if I would pay Attorney
Pratt, who represents my Â¦wife. Mrs. Mary
A. Kollman, the sum of $35 I would
not be bothered any more.
"Then I went again to see Attorney
Ross,, but he refused to do anything for
me. Attorney Pratt's clerk came often to
my house and said that if I did not 'put
up' I would be'sent to jail. I would do
anything in reason, but I have no money.
My shop is n one-chair shop and I only
make $6 or $7 a week. My mother has
also given me the money to pay Ross
with, find I do not care to get more from
her, as she is old and feeble and needs all
she has."
Judge Kerrigan's examination of Attor
ney lloss will only go Into his act in sup
plying Kollman with the fictitious "copy"
of a decree of divorce. It is doubtful'if
the court has the authority to question
the contract bearing Ross" signature,
though in tho agreement Ross binds him
self for a consideration to secure a de
cree which he did not secure and which
Judpe Kerrigan says was not issued be
cause the proofs were" insufficient. .
In the Divorce Court.
Lulu Thoerner has sued Louis Thoerner
for a divorce, alleging desertion as oaus.j
of action.
Decrees of divorce were granted yester
day to "William SpIesS/from Mary Jano
Spless for cruelty, Laura F. Cook from
Edward A. Cook for failure to provide.
