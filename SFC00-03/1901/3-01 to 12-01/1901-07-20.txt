â¢ Achieved',* was the" thenie of
Rev. J. W. Saunby.B. A... of : Medicine^
Hat. Northwest Territory. He told of the
Epworth Leaguers in his territory giving
$25,000 annually and having thirty mem
bers in the foreign field. He also spoke
of the benefit of the missionary libraries
In the societies. Three thousand sets of
these have already been sold. Several
districts, he eald, are raising the whole
conference assessments.
Work Before Us.
Messrs. Kerby and Turk, who have be
come very popular with the audiences,
sang "Redeemed by Love," after which
Rev. "W. W. Cooper of Kenosha. Wis.,
spoke upon "The "Work Before Us." He
spoke in part as follows:
We should aspire to become the greatest mis
sionary church in the world. We should lead
the missionary enterprise rather than remain
near the bottom of the list. We are giving
only 50 cents per capita per year to send the
gospel to two-thirds of the world who have
not, as yet, heard of the Savior, while the lit
tle Moravian church is giving over $2 per
capita.
Our hands are red 'with crime which was
perpetrated early in the history of the League,
and we are accessory to the crime so long as
we remain silent and do not rise up and wash
the stains from the pases of our history. It
is a crime before God that we have tied the
hands of our millions of young-j people an'J
say they cannot take a collection for other
than League purposes.
We need to dignify the most Important work
the church has to do by creating- a missionary
department.
Personal Work for Christ.
Rew R. S. Cantine, D. D., of Los An
geles, â¢ spoke on "Personal Work for
Christ." He said in part:
Gladstone's greatest work was not In Par
liament, but that for lost souls. The time for
this work is youth. Who ever saw a John
Wesley beginning: work when his hair was
gray.
Edward D. Soper, a young layman of
Harrisburg, Pa., was the last speaker of
the afternoon. His theme was "Young
Laymen as Soul "Winners." He said in
part:
Bout-winning is absolutely necessary, on the
part of laymen for their own success. A lay
man's life muat be an active life or there Is
no life at alL Give him a Sunday school class,
make him a leader of meetings and keep him
busy until he Is fitted to personally direct
eouls to the Savior.
The preacher cannot do all the work alone.
The young people are afraid of preachers. The
ones that can reach the young: people, and
the only ones that can, are the y-jung people
themselves. >.
.The session closed with the singing of
"Abide With Me," and a benediction by
Dr. Case of this city.
Free Car Rides Are Refused.
E. C. Gilbert, ex-general, secretary of

TIMELY TOPICS
ARE DISCUSSED
CONTRARY to the expectations of
the reception committee, a large
delegation of __ Epworth Â¦ Leaguers
arrived in the city from the south
yesterday. The party numbered
200 and was made up of workers
from Ban Luis Oblspo and Intermediate
points. The leaguers came by boat and
were met at the pier # by the ferry recep
tion detail.
Word has been received that more than
one hundred leaguers who have been de
tained in the southern part of the State
on side trips Trill arrive to-day and take
part In the closing exercises of the con
vention. Arrangements have been made
by the committees for their reception and
necessary accommodations have been se
cured for them.
It was a busy day with the leaguers.
The day began 'with early morning prayer
meetings at several of the leading Metho
dist churches. At 9 o'clock there were
sessions of the convention at the Pavilion
and the Alhambra Theater. There were
rousing meetings at both these places, as
well as In Metropolitan Temple, in the
afternoon and evening. The interest
manifested In ell the sessions was most
marked.
At the noon hour there was a well at
tended meeting 1 of business men at the
Palace Hotel. Many representative mer
chants were In attendance and took
active part In the exercises.
A special missionary conference meeting
has been called for to-day in the rest
room of the art gallery in the Pavilion

gates from every district and chapter are
expected to be present.
The meeting of the board of control at
the Palace Hotel this afternoon is looked
forward to with Interest by the Minnesota
delegates, who are -urging that their State
bÂ« honored with its selection as the meet
ing place for the Epworth convention of
1903. The chances are excellent that their
claims for recognition will be recognized
by the board. Thus far no decided contest
for the honor has developed.

wealth was represented at the meeting,
and all listened with earnestness to the j
words that were spoken calling upon them
to attend to their spiritual as well as ma
terial wants in this busy, materialistic
age. .-.'.'/ ,
The singing of the league hymn, "When
the Roll Is Called," marked the opening
of the meeting. This finished, Dr. Paine
requested all present to join with him in
singing the national anthem. The
chants complied with ready' energy and

A chorus of fully 100 leaguers then sang '
"The Child of Sorrow," after which Dr."

I come from the plains of Nebraska. T. too,
am a business man.' and I want to say that
.never before have I, been received .with such
"kindness as In San Francisco. I 'Wish to see
the business men here. I. know it Is difficult
for them to leave the mart of commerce and
finance during working hours, but at this hour
of the day. the hour of general relaxation from
care and work, men may possibly come to
hear us.
Religion and business can go hand In hand.
It often does, and business men are often truly
religious men. When- a business man Is a
churchman and is a deacon or a Sunday school
teacher he Is more marked than his associates,
and that is why there Is made so much talk
when a business man who Is zealous In church
work goes astray. But how small the percent
age of such cases.
Love is the foundation of all religion, and
with love many things can be done.
The speaker urged his hearers to pause
In their struggle for wealth and commer
cial supremacy and give heed to the wel
fare of their souls. At the close of his
remarks the leaguers sang again and the
audience was dismissed with - a benedic
tion.
- Another meeting will be held at the same
place at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon.' Sev

bers will be delivered.
Journals ana of magazines, the grade of which

Headers of the Daily Press.
Every reader Is better or worse In knowl
edge, morals and religion than be would be
without the dally press. Most dally papers are
allied with one political party and those who
take but one rely on it for facts concerning
measures, leaders and candidates. Independent
papers, when not personal organs; usually agree
with one particular party with much regu
larity. In free countries literature, science,
manufacture, commerce, agriculture, art and
politics are Inseparably united. Hence the
power for good or evil of the newspaper over
the man who read3 It or admits It to his home
Is incalculable. '
A newspaper In general consists of editorials,
edited departments, contributions, advertise
ments and that heterogeneous combination of
facts, rumors, guesses and predictions classi
fied under the head of news.
Newspapers ' may be roughly divided Into
strata. The lowest stratum prefers or is will
ing to serve moral carrion to the people rather
than to purvey to them things pure and sweet.
Every large city and many populous towns
have one 'or more practically the organs of the
classes who maintain themselves by some kind
of J villainy, such as the saloon . Interest, the
gambling interest, the prize-fighting- Interest
and the keepers of places where women descend
to the- level of the most degraded man. who la
sure there to find his mate, and the forms of
political or police protection which are hand
and glove with 'one or all of these abomina
tions. Such papers revel in divorces, domestic
scandals, elaborate details of suicides, murders,
fights.' trials ." and executions, .' and delight in
tearing to pieces the reputation of , families

PRESS IS VYING WITH
COLLEGES AS AN EDUCATOR
Dr. James M. Buckley, a Religious Editor^
Delivers an Interesting Address..
At the morning: meeting of the dele
gates to the Epworth League Convention
in Mechanics' Pavilion the chief address
was made by Dr. James . M. Buckley, the
editor of the* New Tork Christian Advo
cate. The topic he- chose was "Ths :
Church and the Newspaper." j He handled
the subject in lively manner, saying In
part: - : Â¦ . , .

women. But now a fov.rth must be addedâ
the mall box, loaded by the countless products
of the printing press.
To-day the newspaper competes with semi
naries, colleges and universities as an edu- '
cator; with courts as a detector, exposer and
punisher of crime: with fashion as a regulator
of manners and with the church as a modifier'
of morals. Through its advertisements and re
ports of transactions and markets, from . tha
price* of garden truck to the plans and achieve
ments of the cosmopolitan financiers of the
exchanges and bourses, it is the chief reliance
of commerce. It can also nullify the acts of
legislatures and j the decisions Â¦ of ! courts .. by
creating a sentiment -inimical to their "enforce
ment, and it even assumes to elect presidents,
to dethrone kings.' to ' declare war and* to ! criti
cize and direct the movements of armies and
navies. .
The editorial "we" is annex of unknown
value' in an equation never worked out- The
phrase "in these columns" is in popular effect
a kind of equivalent of "by virtue, of my au->
thorlty as king." The fact that' editorials are
unsigned ' divests their authors ef fear and tha

Not for a moment was the enthusiasm
or interest allowed to abate. The meetings
commenced â¢- with ; psalm â¢ singing and
prayers, and songs were Â¦ interspersed be-,
fween the speeches. The morning session
was principally devoted to the position
held by the Methodist church in regard
to the important religious and social prob
lems of the day. Thus the leaders hope
.to- instill into the delegates the true prin-'
clples and aims of their church, so that
they may. in their turn Instruct their
brethren at home.

to show how religion might be utilized for

â¢were In their seats yesterday
morning when Musical Director
jh J. M. Robinson of Oakland an^
\ iiounced the opening: song of the
~. second day's programme of the
Epworth League Convention in
Mechanics' Pavilion. The song was sung
Â¦wita little life until the cornets -of the
sisters rang out in silvery tones on
tne second verse. Songs followed in quick
succession, after which Rer. O. E. Wat
son of Charleston, 8. C, led in prayer.
Dr. John F. Berry, general secretary,
who presided, announced that the absence
of Bishop Earl Cranston. D. D.. L.L. D.. of
Portland, Or., who was to have occupied
the chair, was owing to the serious 111
ness of Ws wife. At. the suggestion or
Dr. Berry & message of sympathy was
eent to the Bishop.
District Attorney William H- And=r=on
of Springfield. I1L, was the first epeaker.
His subject was "The Church and^the
3-iojuor Traffic." He was frequently ap
plauded in the course of his remarks. He
eaid In part:
Churcti and Liquor Traffic
The liquor traffic is Satan's chief ally, and
to overcome It we need the help of CfinstlMB
of an denominations. It dominates politics,
and we must enlist against it right tn lT ifc1ng
men of all parties. The Anti-Salocn League
was established upoa this basis: It represents
consecrated common sense applied to the liquor
Question, Its single obpect is the destruction
â¢cf the ealoon by uniting for work all moral
forces which oj>po&e the saloon. Thirty-eisht
Elates and Territories are organized alon*
these lines and affiliated with the American
Anti-Â£aJoon Lesiue.
Our young people's societies need a. definite
Issue. The object of political parties is to se
cure food government, but they would fall to
jiieoes of their own weight were it not for the
unifying power of a vital issue express'Sd in
concrete terme. The ltajraer often does not
know how to obey the injunction to eare souls.
Impress upon his heart that the way to save
6ouls lor Christ Is to destroy the instituticn
which yearly sends one hundred thousand men
to a drunkard's hell, and you wiU~hear the
tread of victorious hosts, feel the swiw: of
conquest, and the reteran army will be easily
marshaled 10 win ths next victory in his name.
ChurcTi and Workingmen.
"The Church and the Workingman" was
the tfcjeme of Rev. E. J. Helms of .Boston,
Jlass. He eaid in part:
It 1% brttfer to seek the preservation of the
Eabbath for the sake of man than as a reli
gious institution. 6eek to shorten hours of
labor bo we may not only have a. day of rest,
but a rested man for the day. Workincmen
readily respond when the church sincerely
eeeks them aEd their welfare, as illustrated by
the Epworth League house work in Boston.
Bocieir cannot be redeemed by wholesale. Let
thÂ« ciirrch eeek the soul of each man as as
sidnoagly as she 6eeks the benefactions of a
Rockefeller or Carnegie. Let the church bridge
the cbfcsczs torming between the trusts and
\tteir "hands"; between the labor unions and
the Unskilled. If the organized cirareh will
conquer with Christ she must be obedient to
his spirit, Tjhough candidates for the min
istry Â»re fiecreasinc the numbers oi young
I>oople studying to fin positions in the work
of charity and reform have marv-eloasljr multl-'
plied. Our institutions are filling with min
atrrs who seek not only the amelioration but
annihilation of conditions that foster crime and
disease. When the church awakes and IoIIowb
thi$ heavenly vision of Christ-like Â¦ conquering
lore, the vrorkingman will love her and unfier-
Etend and love her Qhrist.
ReK. T. E. E. Shore, XL A_ E. D-, of To
ronto, Canada, spoke of "The Cburch and
the Young Men." He declared that the
younf men of to-day would never be
found in the Church unless the church
Â¦workers went after thpm. He offered the
iollOYrivg solution of. the questions
TTe -must have a meeting of men aloire. "Ii Is
fcll very well to have an Epworth League Trtrere
*r.Â»n and women meet together, bui there mast
he a separate meeting for the men. The young
tnen must have a chance to hit hard. Â¦ This caa
only be done when they are alone. There is a
feminine type and manly type of Christianity.
Both are cood, but you cannot put both to
eethet. Have we not been giving the young
Even too milch milk and not enough meat? Is
it cny wonder there are so many young men
outside of the church, when there is bo little
inside of manliness? Â¦
If you vant to get a strong yxnrng imrn into
the church you must give him Romethinz to
do, some responsibility, some duties, that ap
j>eal ta his manly enterprise. There is no
work young men enjoy so much as winning
othÂ«r ycung men tor something. This has been
proves by organizations such as the T. M. C
A.. tÂ»Â» Brotherhood of St. Paul, the Brother
hood of St. Andrew, and kindred organiza
tions.
Dr. James M. Buckley spoke on fhÂ« sub
ject "The Church and the Newspaper."
It was a lively address and will be found
elsewhere.
Our Imperiled Sabbath.
Ttre, first colored gentleman to appear
on the speaker's platform was the Rev.
J. B. Scott. D. D., of New Orleans, La.
His subject was "Our Imperiled Sabbath."
He spoke as follows:
I consider the Sabbath doubly imperiteil by
the apparent unconcern of the Christian church
whose future welfare depends so largely on the
proper observance of this day. The members
of thÂ« ehurch are often the leaders In that
speculation and pleasureâ seeking spirit which
sacrifices principle and tramples sacred things
underfoot, when these stand in the way of the
end In view. They devote the hours for wor
ship te pleasure, and Eeek to excuse themselves
by fallacious arguments that would held good
neither in the courts of the land nor before the
tribunal of common sense. The pulpit is large
ly client on the subject, either to avoid giving
offense to the guilty or because it has delegated
this work to agents and organizations that 60
vote their entire time to the subject The re-
rait is that there are hundreds of young people
evei among those .who are under the influence
of the â¢church who never give the proper ob
servance of the Sabbath a serious thought.
Such things as these add greatly to the prob
lem before us, for verily, a man's most dai>
rerous foes are those of his own household.
Believing, then, that the Sabbath as a day of
worship and of rest is essential to the present
and future welfare of man, it is thÂ« indiapen^
cable duty of every leaguer and every citizen
who wishes that which is best for the church,
and best for his country through the church.
to unite tn emphasizing and enforcing that
Klorious old command, "Remember the Sab
bath dajr to kee^i It holy."
The Institutional Churdx.
Rev. Ward Beecher Ptekard, E>. E>., -of
Cleveland. Ohio, proved to be a popular
speaker. While his subject, "The Institu
tional Church," was applicable only for
city delegates, his thoughts met with the
hearty approval of the entire convention,
lie said In r>art: . Â»
TnÂ« aim of the Institutional church "ie to
save all men and all of the man by all means.'"
Therefore, while not neglecting the function
cf worship it underscores (social, recreational
and educational methodg. Its open door, free
pewE, plurality cf workers and its provisions
for teaching, for amusement and for system
atic industrial work, give it distinctive char
acteristics. Institutional methods are an ap
plication of good business principles tc the
lx>rd'e work. Tbey are a. protest against the
policy of Investing millions of money In build
ings to be used only a fraction of the time.
Even the devil would have to go out of trade
if he adopted such a plan. The 'methods of
tiie church applied to trade or education would
be suicidal. Build the church so that it can
be used and then use It. is the business rule
of ehurch life. The methods adopted and the
principles underlying this work are in accord
ivith the most advanced theories of education.
No permanent Impression without motor expres
sion is the fundamental law that gives us the
kindergarten, the blackboard and the manual
training class. .
The crying demand of the hour 1b for conse
crated personality. Money is- more plentiful
than men. "Wealth is easier to find than
women. The Epworth League must be the
school where workers are to be trained to carry
forward the social betterment movement* of
the ace. Let this training begin in your chap
ter. Let it begin with you.
The last address of the morrririg- session

_-.i'. r * Personal "Work for Christ.
On the subject "Personal "Work for
Christ" Rev. Payette L. Thompson of'
Jackson.^^Iich., said:
In this personal work certain words stand
for qualities and equipments of imperative Im
portance. One may do much lacking many of
them, but If one Is to do the most, and be
at his best no one of them must be entirely
soul, character and conduct. One .cannot 11tÂ«
less than the best at any time without that
fact cheapening hi3 words at all times. Cour

has been -called "Coward's Castle," or the im

Christ beauty. Cromwelllan bluntness may
express the truth, but Cromwell is ancient his
tory and force was bis law. Contact, so that
healing goes out from us. It Is surely no ac
cident that Christ touched those he healed.
The settlement idea is In the air and remote
seduslveness represents not the Christ who so
loved .the world tnat he came. Sympathy,
which means symphony, you remember.
That harmony by which one comes Into fellow

Spirit, without whom It Is worse than folly
to take either the Father's name upon our lips
or bis work Into our hands.
League is not merely a local improvement so
ciety. Upon teem has come the mighty con
viction that Christ's commission to evangelize
the world is a duty Imposed upon the individ
ual Christian. Imbued with this conviction,
they feel that it is the purpose of Christianity
to bring the whole earth under Messiah' i. sway.
They believe that the only hope of man 13 in
the gospel. There is no nation so barbarous
It cannot civilize, no nature so gross it can
not refine, no mind so ignorant It cannot en
lighten, no heart so carnal It cannot spiritual
ize, no will so enslaved it cannot emancipate
and no soul so lost It cannot save, and this
movement has revealed to our youth that the
church is the agency In God's hands for pro
claiming this gospet to every creature.
Laymen as Soul-Winners.
Rev. "Walter A. Cooke of Cyprus River,
Manitoba, Canada, delivered a thoughtful
discourse upon the topic "Young Laymen

within the gates of a new century, and the
Lord's command is "Speak unto the children
of Israel, that they go forward." i We, who
are here, Epworth Leaguers, have our own
inalienaMe place in this mighty army,* and in
these favored lands where Christianity Is more
or less dominant, but where there are sucn
alarming members who are hostile to the king
dom of God, or else Indifferent to It. we are
comma tided' to move forward In the great work
of winning souls, consecrating ourselves with
new enthusiasm to this holy -war. More ear
nestness, more zeal, more aggression, more
abandon, more there should be of the spirit of
him who counted not his life dear unto him
self that he might save some. From a careful
consideration of the subject it does not seem
too much to say that the majority of younsr
laymen are not soul-winners; they are not
marching forward to win victories for God.
but simply marking time or resting In their
tents. It is a matter of Individual, personal
responsibility. "Every one of us shall give
account of himself to God." Are you striving
for souls, as you will wish you had done In
that sacred hour when you pass out from this
mortal life Into the presence of your God?

. The first speaker was Rev. G. S. Clen
dlnnen of Erockville, Ontario, Canada,
who spoke on "Systematic Benevolence."
He defined systematic benevolence and ex
plained Its relation to the personal Income
of men. It was not merely a question of
personal offering, but it Involved the
whole use of men's incomes in relation to
Christian lives. Continuing, the speaker
said:
To the Christian all things are sacred. To
be a Christian is td. be Inspired with the spirit
of benevolence, with the spirit of Christ. This
spirit nay express Itself acordln? to rule.
ernVlonal Impulse or the New Testament prin
ciples. There is no affair in life which de
mands greater attention than the stewardship
of money. Money Is a trust, a power of which
the holder or trustee must render* strict ac
counting. Property Is a responsibility. Men
ask if they have not the right to do with
their property as they choose. I answer that
they have the right to do what they ought
to do, but they nave no right to make im
proper use of what God has iKen them. The
true conception of Christian benevolence Inter
dicts all avenues of illegitimate gain. A
benevolent man will sacrifice selfish interests
for the public good.
The speaker urged that one of the great
est needs of society is the adjustment or
the question of earning and savings. Any
one, he said, who evades the payment of
taxes or sponges upon the church is aa
mean as any defaulter and as degraded as
any thief. He held it to be a burning
shame that mendicancy Is tolerated in a
country so rich in resources as Is Amer
ica. Character, he concluded, was the real
test and standard of all values.
The "Work Before Us.
Rev. F. Burgette Short of "Wilmington,
Del., spoke on the subject, "The Work
Before Us." He said:
There are multitudes of jroumr people, and
boys and girls In our own towns and cities,
that are not reacTied by the church nor the
Sunday school. Here are opportunities for
Christian service. After them we should go.
and bring /them- Into the fold. Then there are
the millions in heathen lands whose ears have
never caught ths eweet cadence of Christian
song, nor whose hearts have ever been stirred
by the story of_ Christ's love. "We dare not

to the calls. The Island that lately came Into

TO-DAY'S CONVENTION PROGRAMME.
is essentially masculine. We' glory in ;' the
"eternally feminine" element in the spiritual
life of the church. But there is a rugged.- ac
tive and practical Bide of the religion which
must be emphasized before the church will be
thronged with men. Those who are giving
thought to this problem are studying to call
into exercise the faculties and talents Â¦ which
are peculiar to the sturdier sex. To acocÂ«npliBh
this will be in no small way to the profit of
woman, to whom a church without men is less
and less attractive, as her growing absorption
In clubs and fraternal annexes is sufficient
proof. Let the church interest men If It wishes

AFTERNOON WORK
AT ALHAT1BRA
The meeting in the afternoon at the Al
harobra opened with William Burdette
Mathews of Charleston, W. Va., in the
chair. Many of the delegates who In the
morning had gone to the Pavilion and
were disappointed in not being able to
hear the speakers distinctly; in the after
noon came to the Alhambra. They were
fully repaid for the change, as the pro
gramme at the theater Included many ex
cellent addresses on timely topics. Be
fore. the speakers commenced their vol
leying'H. "W. Kerr of Detroit, Mich., and
,J. McD. Kerr of .Toronto, Canada, de
lighted the audience with a duet. They
were encored.
â¢j Rev. R. S. Cantlne, D. D., of Los An
geles delivered the first address. He took
for his theme, "Systematic Benevolence,"
and said in part:
i
Talk about Christian beneficence. It is a
sham and a fraudâ too much like giving a do
nation to a minister when the church owes him
ten times as much as they donate. It is rob
bery in the name of charity. With our entire
Protestant church membership of over 13,000,000
we owe the Lord $407,228,67(1 a year and $4,072,
2S6.700. for the decade, but. we give only one
sixth of these amounts, which' leaves us with the
learful debt of $339,357,225 a year or $3,393,572,250
for the decade. Is it strange that God should
.eay, "Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have
"robbed me, even this whole nation?" Can we
expect his favor on the pitiable pittance we pre
tend to give him, when we owe him six times
the sum? Should we not remember that we are
stewards, not proprietors, and that the debts
must be paid, not because God needs it, but
because we owe it to him as the custodian and
managers of this property?
Following Rev. Mr. Cantine's address
came a discussion of missionary work,
the improvement and extension of which
is one of the greatest questions confront
ing this convention. The entire field was
reviewed. The results already accom
plished were enumerated, while the work
yet to. be undertaken, was clearly ex
plained. '' s
Rev. Joshua M. Frost of â¢ BangcT, Me.,
spoke first. His subject was "Missionary
Forward Movement in the League â Re
sults Achieved." He said in part: -â¢ Â¦
No Individual Christian ever realized the ex
tent of his experience or his strength in Christ
until he became imbued with the true mission
ary spirit. What the Epworth League needed
more than anything etee to insure He lasting
success was a great objective purposeâ that pur
pose was imparted to it when foreign mission
ary work was undertaken. Although the. great
body of Â¦ leaguers cannot afford to give much
In money, they can at least assist byprayer and
personal interest. Although but four years have
passed since. this movement was inaugurated,
the ardor for missionary work has already
spread through the entire order. The nineteenth
century has already Â¦passed, but only one-third
of the human race has been Christianized. If
the Methodist denomination in all its strength
could be truly awakened to this great work the
whole world would soon be Billed with a knowl
edge of the true God.
The speaker \ further advocated the
adoption by the league of a plan of sys
tematic giving for missionary work. He
stated that a 2-cerrt stamp given each day
by every, member of the league would re
sult in an annual income of J13.000.000,
which sum would enable the missionary
leaders to double their present force.
Rev." L. Cobb of Nashville. Tenn~. fol
lowed and" completed the discussion In re
gard to missions. The title of his address
was "Missionary Forward Movement in
the Leagueâ the Work Before "Us."
"Personal Work for Christ" was the
title of an entertaining- and Instructive
lecture which was delivered by Rev.; L.
Cobb of Nashville, Tenn.
E. T. Colton, representing the -younger
members of the Epworth League and the
younger generation, spoke on "Yourtg
Laymen as Soul Winners." In the first
part of his dissertation he followed along
the lines of the speaker who had preceded
him and related incidents of college life
showing; the result of personal efforts and
j?ersonal appeals..
The distinction of winding up the good
work of the afternoon session fell to the
lot ol Rev. J. W. Bashford, X>. C of Del
aware, Ohio. Altbo-ugn he had but Just
finished a long speech at Mechanics' Pa
vilion he acquitted himself .well His ad
dress on "Our English Bible and How to
Use It" proved to be a brilliant defense
of the holy book, which he advised every
one to study, not for the sake of quoting
but 1h order to commune with the spirit of
the Lord. He sa^id in Dart: . .
The Bupreme value of the Bible arises from
lta influence over individuals and races. Three
of the great religions of the worldâ Judaism
Mohammedanism and Christianityâ sprang from
the CHd Testament. It is at least 6triking that
in the evolution of civilizations and races un
der the law of the survival of the fittest the
Jews with their religion have outlasted Egypt
ians and Babylonians, Greeks . and Romans.
It is because Protestaniem rests upon the word
of God that Protestant nations are the leaders
in modern civilization. When Victoria was
asked by a Hindoo the secret of Britain's
power ehe pointed to the Bible. Christ is the
key. to history. The Bible is set for the rise
and fall of races and civilizations, is it not
at least a striking coincidence that during the
same century when 85 per cent of the mission
ary -work of the world was done by men and
women whose native speech is - your mother
tongue, under the stern law of the survival of
the fittest the English speech ' was belting the
globe? Upon the other hand our failures and
our unrest-are due to our disobedience to God's
word, and the only hope of America is applied
Young Men -as Soul Winners
Should Be Encouraged Is
. Opinion of Rev. E. E. Soper
admit that many of .their class bear no rela
tion to. the church. The worklngman believes
the church cares nothing for him, so he cares
nothing for the church. She has moved away
from his humble locality to the fashionable
suburb. She seems to cater to the man with
the gold ring and costly apparel. While the
saloon is open' day 'and night, â¢ the church is
locked except for . a few hours on Sunday.
When ha does go occasionally he hears ora
tory and music, but little about Christ or how
to overcome sin and lead a better life. *
Church and Young Man.
The Rev. C. E. â¢ Patillo, D. D:. of St.
Louis, Mo., the next speaker, had for his
subject "The Church and the Young
Man." His speech'was principally devoted
to describing how, in his opinion,'the
young men who are Indifferent to their re-
ligion may be brought back into the fold.
He declared that the young men would be
instrumental in solving the greatest- prob-
lems of the century. In part his speech
m, ââ foiinwq. Â¦
was as ionows. f . . . #
'I realize that'Involved in this question are
nearly all the great problems of the day. In
the hands of the young man\have been placed
the scepter of empire and he has brought en-
thusiasm and vigor, to confront the battles-of
life. . - = Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ V
The young men must be brought to realize
that the Influence of the church is not mean-
ingless and that the Christian man Is the
highest type of manhood. They must be
brought to know that at the' altar of church
are given higher and nobler gifts than ever
came from the hands of kings.
-If the church can only bring to her altars
the vast army of the .young men, â¢discipline-
them. drill them,' instruct and commission
them to rlo Â¦ her - commands, this age will see
the - solution of the greatest problems of the
century. The fact is that the young men of
to-day have lost their regard for the church,
They consul<*f " the ' Bible as meaningless and
'no longer deem it the court of last appeal in
the case of morals.
.In conclusion he said that the defection
of the young men from the church was
due to their ability to detect fraud in the
services and in the preaching of the mln-
lsters, and that in order to induce.them
to return to the church the ministers
must be guided In their work by the spirit
of the Lord.
our possession must be taken for God. we
need at least five enthusiastic and intelligent
men whose sole duty is to visit our confer
ences and churches and stir up our young peo
ple to Join the great crusade against wrongr.
To accomplish this work the organization
must not only be well officered and have the
sympathy, devotion, loyalty and service of the
rank and file;' It must also have power. In
dividual enduement Is the necessity. I do not
mean a* baptism, of spiritual self-conceit, for
love Is not putted up;-nor a baptism of spirit
ual arrogance, for love doth not behave itsel*
unseemly; nor a baptism of self-righteousness,
for the crowning grace of love is humility;
but I do mean a baptism of the old fashion,
and the only fashion, holy ghost; eld fashion
common sense spiritualized.
Missionary Forward Work. x^
Rev. T. Albert Moore of Hamilton, Can
ada, spoke on the theme. "The Missionary
Forward Movement In the League." Ho
said in substance: '
This movement has given our Leaguers a
wider outlook. They* have learned that the
League Is not merely a local improvement so
ciety. Upon them has come the mighty con-
The Liquor Traffic.
One of the most powerful addresses of
the morning session was that of Rev. W.
B. Palmore, L>. D., of St. Louis, Mo. He
selected for his subject, "The Church and
the, Liquor Traffic," and forcefully deplet
ed the destruction which has resulted
from the establishment of the American
saloon throughout the world. He said in
part:
High tax and low tax on the liquor trade
in reality are sin tax. The welfare of "the
people in this country demands that the saloon
shall be destroyed. There is not room enough
In the city nor In the whole world for a tri
umphant church and a triumphant saloon. The
desolation wrought by the American saloon Is
found in all parts of the world. When you
step from a steamer at the ports of Japan, at
Shanghai, at Calcutta, at Bombay or even in
darkest Africa you are Immediately confronted
by an American saloon. Hardly had our army
reached the Philippines when a volunteer threw
eff his coat and established a saloon. Now
there are 400, and if the American flag Is to
wave over 400 saloons Jt should wave at half
mast. It has been declared by some politician
high in authority ttfat a hogshead of whisky
judiciously placed in New York could make
or unmake a President.
This age will see a young David who will
come forward to overthrow, the monstrous giant
of intemperance. This young David will be in
the person "of the Epworth League, the Y. M.
C. A. and the other vast armies of united young
men of all denominations. â¢
Our Imperiled Sabbath. .'. . '
"in his address on "Our Imperiled Sab
bath" Rev. Edwin M. Randall, D. D., of
Seattle, Wash., entered an earnest pro
test again3t the desecration of the one
day in the week which Christianity has
consecrated to the worship" of God. He
declared that the Sabbath is essential to
religious life and that its destruction
would be the doom of Christian! tS". He
said in i>art: . . * / . - .
We greatly need an awakened and intelli
gent conscience. As individuals we must keep
the Sabbath holy at any cost and everywhere.
We must treat It as a welcome opportunity
and put It to the best use- for perfecting the
entire man. /Church services should be better
planned and full of the spirit that proves the
goepel the power of God unto salvation. The
Sabbath problem can only -be settled right
"by a. church able to raise the cross In triumph
over the world.' In behalf of this sacred i and
priceless day, I appeal to the great army of
the Epworth League, to their loyalty, to toil
worn humanity; to Â¦ the State, to our church,
to our race and to God.
The Institutional Church.
"The Institutional Church" was the
subject of an interesting address which
was delivered by Rev. Matthias S. Kauf
man, Ph. D., of Seattle. Wash. On ac
count of the Intense interest which this
topic is at present exciting among 1 the
Methodists his remarks were received
with the keenest attention. He strongly
asserted that to win souls for the king
dom of God man's temporal welfare must
be ministered to. He said In part:
Thousands are being led Into heaven through
the open door of the churcn. Christianity
cares for man's temporal welfare as weU aa
his spiritual. It looks at man through the
eyes of Christ. This I Idea of keeping the
churches open seven days in the week Is com
mending: Itself to the great multitude. Every
possible means should be employed to lead men
Into the kingdom of Cod.
I am charmed and fascinated by the achieve
ment, aim and scope of the. "Institutional
Church." If the alms. and purposes of the Ep
worth League were fully carried out and devel
oped that order would be practically an Institu
tional church. It la the love . element In our
church which must be carried down among the
people. Personal effort la the greatest medium
for good In the Institutional church. We must
bleed and suffer for this world. No evil comes
to this earth to stay. 'Evil is Inherently weak.
We want a religion great enough to graDDle
with all the sin of the world. â¢
The meeting then closed with the sine
ing of a hynm and benediction.

DESPITE the counter attractions
at Metropolitan Temple ajid the.
Alhambra, the evening session
of the Epworth League Conven
tion In the Mechanics' Pavilion
opened with an Immense throng:.
Fully 9000 people were seated
Â¦when the programme began. The session
took the form of a missionary mass
meeting- and was presided over by Rev.
Matt S. Hughes. D.D., of Kansas City. In
the absence of Governor A. T. Bliss of
Michigan, who was expected to preside.
The song service was led by W. C.
Btadfeld, and Rev. Samuel Plantz. D. D-,
of Appleton, Wis., led the devotions.
What Constitutes a Missionary.
Bishop Henry W. "Warren, D.D.. LL. D..
of Denver. Colo., was very impressive In
his address. He spoke in part:
The end for which this world was made and
in upheld is its . spiritual outcome. I know
it has ores to be dug. handled, emelted; I
know It has plains to be cleared, plowed, plant
ed and reaped; it has powers, steam and light
ning, to be handled and mastered; it has in
tellectual mysteries to be Bolved, and Intel
lects to be made treat by the solving; but the
one designed outcome is human character fit
to be kept forever.
There is one treat marvel in the universe,
stA only one. ThÂ«t ls that the Son of God
carr.e out of tht infinite glory, took flesh and
Ell the worst human conditions, death in
cluded. Why did he come? 'What object T5fas
â¢worth the sacrifice, the insults, the agony,
the death? Did he come to develop mines,
to handle powers, to rule empires? No one,
ccr all these objects was worth his coming,
lie already had sold plenty enough to pave
the street* of tola capital, power enough to
incve the N'ew Jerusalem adorned as a bride
lor hor hueband ;â¢ he was King of kings and
Lcrd of lords. Why come?
Livtneston In the heart of Africa, well ex
pressed it: "God had but one Son. and he was
& missionary." Ah. thÂ«n, being a missionary
is worthy of God. To leave home, heaven,
angels, father, glory, to come to an accursed
country, to teach the ignorant, be insulted
by the proud, buffeted and killed, that is be
ing a. -ttiselocary. that is the only thing in
this vrorld worthy or God, worthy of his ut
most love. But It is not sacrifice without an
object.
He comes with succor speedy
To those who suffer wrong.
To help the poor and needy.
And bid the weak be strong.
Or as be himself put It far better: "The
eplrit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
ecolnted me to preach the gospel to the poor;
he bath sent me to heal the broken-hearted.
to preach deliverance to the captives, and re
covering cf sight to the blind, to set at lib
erty them that are bruised, to preach the ac
ceptable year cf the Lord." Luke lv:18-19.
Every Epworthian Can Enlist.
With that conception of a raieeionary, every
Epworthlan can snllst. Not every one of these
thousands can go to Africa, India or China,
but every one can te a missionary, can have
the spirit of the Lord anoint him to preach
the gospel to thÂ« poor, heal the broken-hearted,
and live the life "lrorthy of God.
All school teachers, all intelligent Epworth
lans vrho ar* embodiments of knowledge ac
quired and dispensed are true missionaries of
CT.ritt in this department.
Every Snndar echool teacher, mother, friend.
In private life or public, is a true missionary
of the ideal missionary who came from heaven
to earth.
Genius Is Not Required.
Christ's idea, of this world ls not a place from
which he could save out a few elect saints
and then burn up al! the rest His idea is to
establish the kingdom of heaven on earth, have.
God's will don* In every part of it as it is
In heaven have the knowledge of God cover
the earth as thÂ» waters of- the vast Pacific
cover the sea. Wherever that kingdom is not
perfected, that will not be done as in Heaven,
that knowledge of God not so prevalent, there
he wants missionaries; in your clty^ in your
church in your borne, in your heart. It does
not require genius, ten talents, far travel, ex
clusive command of time to be one of Christ s
missionaries. Xone of the disciples had these.
It only requires an experience and fidelity.
Let the Ideal missionary commission every one
of you to-day. Let the commission reach clear
up to that of tht apoetlee. "If ye continue in
my word then are ye my disciples indeed."
Oh, Andrews, Jchns, Pauls who hear me, dls
clpleshlp has not yet been given op. Apostle

ages. Twelve was the limit for the Jews only.
God called Paul to be the first of the larger
college of apoetles fo the Gentiles. He now
calls out of the heavens to you. saying, "Thou,
thou art a chosen vessel unto me to bear my
name unto the Gentiles." Hear, oh hear. The
Moravians are said no support one missionary
to tvery sixty members. Let It be said that
MethodUts support one missionary to every
cut member. ' \ .
b w* < HE assemblage of Epworth
'Â¦ 1 1 at the Alhambra T.heater
Â¦ reached its climax at the evening
1 . session. Not a single seat or foot
H of standing: room on the main floor
or In the gallery was vacant. 'With
' , , the increase in attendance came
a commensurate Increase In enthusiasm
and eloquence. Each of the four speakers
delivered speeches that. sparkled with wit
and rounded periods. The only regret. of
the leaguers in the audience appeared to
be that they could not force their enter
tainers to prolong- their efforts. â¢ '
Under a full blaze: of the. incandescent
light' the interior of the theater, decked
with flowers and streamers of the league's
colors, presented a splendid appearance. .
The evening session,, which .will -be
memorable in league annals for the elo
quence that was displayed, was well
opened with a patriotic address by Rev.
G. H. Cobbledlck, M. A., Parkhlll, On
tario. He dwelt on the topics which. are
exciting public Interest and likened the
course of the United States in the Philip
pines to the movements of England in
South Africa. He said in part: Â¦
The ballot ls not a personal asset convertible
into personal interest, but it Is a puDllo trust
of power from God, to be used for the fur
therance of his kingdom. The voter ls ."the
power ordained of God" In this country mine,
for sovereignty rests with the people. Hence
it is that the Union Jack and Stars and Stripes
float, and wo believe shall float together for
the uplifting of the oppressed and the enfran
chisement of the slave^ In these democratic
lands, men are all free. and equal, on the elec
tion day at least. The need of the hour ls a.
Christian patriotism that will show that to
enter public life ls not to abandon i righteous
ness. The demand is for men of humble and
reverent spirit, who like Joshua will recognize
tha Bllent Presence, and obey the heavenly
vision. The Epworth League' exists to train
such men. Its own future will require more'
attention to its altruistic efforts. .The cross
ls calling tho organized: Christian' youth .of
these lands to a more unselfish career. The
evangelization of the world tarries for this
forward movement and 'the national life of two
great 1 peoples waits the inspiration of their
high endeavor for good citizenship. The in
fluence of the League will grow as the spec
tacular gives place to the utilitarian. The
passing of Niagara may be lamented by somo
esthetic soul, but the clamor of the. world's
needs is as deep calling unto the -deep and
from serving only scenic effect Niagara is
yielding its powers to bless America. â¢ The
volume of Christian enthusiaim- which renders
possible this vast gathering must obey the law
of its life and yield Itself to drive the ma
chinery of the world's higher civilization along
the quivering nerves of its organic life, must
run the very heart throb of God, bearing light
to the dark places â¢ and motive power for the
renewal of the earth in righteousness.
The Causes of Pauperism. .
Rev. J. J. N. Kenny of Modesto .Cal.
made one of the most powerful addresses
of the evening and the audience was re
luctant to let him terminate hl3 efforts
He said in part:
The causes of pauperism are various and
many. Some .of the chief are heredity, illit
eracy, indolence and Intemperance,, which Is
far more potent than we dream of. /These are
but a few causes that bring men and women
to poverty. - ' â¢- . \. Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦â¢'Â¦.- Â¦ ... .
How can this problem be solved? It certainly
cannot be done by giving, which only assists
in making paupers. Social rights no less than
moral rights must â¢ be recognized. Justice - in
the matter of wages, rent and Interest would
remedy the evils in regard to those people who
are willing to work. . Â¦ ... Â¦ " ..;..,
We need in this land a public opinion and
"Kill the Saloon'V was the subject : of
the address ,: delivered ..by . Rev. ., M.. â¢ C
Hawks, â¢ the last speaker of . the evening.
His speech was a strong argument against
intemperance Â¦ and the speaker declared
that the < saloon-keepers should-' be ' made
social outcasts. He said in part: ;
I Why, them should the i saloon exist and ' be
protected? Can it compensate society for. Its
existence? It Is never; claimed for . it that
its aim ls the elevation of society. ; On- the
contrary the fortunes it has wasted. - the . homes
it has disgraced, the reputations it has ruined,
the high hopes it has destroyed, the death.lt
has engendered, the brutality, it has bred and
the men and women it has sent to prison, and
the gallows point to it as 'one of I the .world's
most accursed evils. Â¦Â¦â¢ Its path across society
from the first ls marked by the increase of-pov
erty, crime â¢ and insanity and tho destruction
of virtue and happiness. Its way Is the way
to hell going down to the chambers of death.
It lives on bread, that ought to feed destitute
wives and 'little children. It sucks the best
blood of. honest toil. It is a plague, a curse,'
a blotch and a monster, covered with the blood
of ten thousand slain. It ought not to be li
censed. , I would sooner stick a Government
stamp on the nose of a mad dog and turn him
loose on the streets. And yet it is licensed, and

The Rev. E. M. Taylor of Cambridge,
Mass., discoursed on "The Christ Life in

lence," saying m part:
Benevolence for self service must be well
organized. Distributing money does not neces
sarily relieve distress. Most alms giving la
demoralizing. Modern city associated char
ities work is corrective. Principle, not senti
mentality, should direct benevolence. System
atic benevolence must be constructive as well
as remedial. It ls not sufficient to- sti_nd on
the verge of the social cataract and pull a- few
victims out of the current. We must plant
ourselves at the sources of the stream that
make up the great current. This preventive
work Is less attractive to many people than
that of rescue work, but it has the promise of
better results. Institutions for spreading
knowledge are productive of more good than
institutions for punishin? crime. It la deeper

The Rev. "W. J. Smith of Toronto made
use of the time allotted to him in laying
down the', lines for church members to
follow. In \ keeping with those of the
founder of Christianity. - - .
Professor Edwin Mlms of Durham. N.
C, spoke on the theme of "Christ in the
Literature of tbo Twentieth Century." He
said in part:
There was a tlma, when Christ was the sub
ject of art and literature; the pre-Raphaelites
in art, and Dante in poetry formed in the
Christian religion the most beautiful and tru
est art. â¢ â¢â¢-Â¦;.. â¢ Â¦
But the Christ' of medieval art lacks human
ity, lacks richness. . With the triumph of the
renaissance and the â¢ reformation Â¦ has come a
new senÂ»e of the 'value of humanity and the
dignity of " human reason. J We are bediming
to see with- Phillips Brooks, however, that the
interpretation of all modern movements is
found in the human and divine Christ.
Christ Life in New Century.
The Rev. F. T. Keeney of Auburn. N.
T., spoke entertainingly on "The Christ
LJfe in the New Century." He said in
brief:
Social problems and relations are constantly
becoming, more complex. The great need for
their solution . in j this ;or in i any country is
Christâ the Christ love, the Christ vision, the
ear attention . of > the [ people. " but that alone
never saved a soul or comforted one. It is
heart attention that Is necessary." "While. I
was musing the fire burned." If persons were
compelled to read the Sunday paper and did it
unwillingly they might Indeed go to' the house
of God and by reaction be well prepared "for
worship, but if . they read with avidity they
go there preoccupied, prefllled and apathetic or
antagonistic Â¦
Newspapers Help the Church. -
Oh. yes, the newspapers help the church
much; so far as. the. press supports morality,
order and good government, J t serves.lt much,
it publishes many sermons, presents the facts
of religious progress, advertises services, ad
mits and makes useful criticisms, promotes
wide and general spiritual movements, ren
ders much aid by collecting: and disseminating
religious news, often spreads the worthy fame
of useful ministers,, reports the proceedings of
ecclesiastical bodies; holds up to deserved rid
icule purely sensational preachers, quack evan
gelists and gross superstitions and for all of
this the church thanks It. but the church can
not consistently thank the press for the Sunday
newspaper. :
The religious press is necessary to give spe
cial, extended and accurate reports of all re
ligious matters and. a summary, of the news
suitable for Christian famnles: to defend Chris
tianity against atheism, infidelity. Â¦ spiritualism,"
theosophy, Christian Science and.Mormonlsm,
and when necessary Protestantism against Ro
manism, evangelical Christianity against the
barren negations of those who deny the detty
of Christ and the subtle : suggestions of Â¦ those
who whisper, in the sinner's ear the modern
version of the tempter's Insinuation.- "You shall
have as good as and perhaps a better chance
to reform after, death than before": and to
explain to each generation the principles of the
denomination, also the religious Journal and
it alone can properly characterize its pioneers,
heroes and spiritual leaders, and preserve rev
erence for those who have laid the foundations.
It Is " far more important now than ever it
was. The enterprises of the church are great-
them are within its borders. These are they
who evaporate or congeal the blood of the
atonement and spread doubt whether Christ
knew, the true meaning or proper application of
the very passages on which he relied to Drove
himself the Messiah. There is much ] indiffer
ence, growing parish Isolation, decline of de

issued the following appeal:
ALL, DELEGATES TAKE NOTTfcE.
Since mission is to be the chief work of the
Epworth League for the coming year, It is
strongly urged, that as many as possible of
the delegates from each State be present at the
special missionary conference that is to be
held in the main body of Mechanics' Pavilion

delegate from every district,, and if possible
one from every chapter, should be present to

Second, we ought to go, for we owe all of
our civilization to Christianity. Under the old
civilization three-fourths of the--people were
slaves,: murder was made a pastime, debauch
ery was reduced to a science, suicide was ele
vated to an art, infanticide was installed as
a domestic virtue. But Christianity came and
waved her wand over those pagan institutions
and one by one they disappeared, so that to
night, with all its defects, the British and
American civilization form the high tide mark
in the history of the world. No slave crouches
beneath the shsdow of those flags and wherever
they float human life and liberty are secure.
The session closed with a.song and ben

given. It is easier for Bishop Taylor to reach
the banks of the Congo than for Paul to reach

It was to woo the cultured Athenian from the
worship of the beautiful.
The genius of the gospel comes out in that
Grand "Work of Christianity.
After a song by the North Indiana Con
ference quartet the Rev. James Hender
son. D. D., of Toronto, Canada, delivered
an -Interesting address. In which he said:
"What is the scriptural sanction? In the
Sermon on the Mount, immediately following
the Beatitudes, which state the blessedness of
the missionaries, the Master Introduces in a
double figure the necessity, the universability
and the Instruments of the work*. "Ye are the
light of the world; ye are the salt of the
earth." The church is a mission celestial in
origin and equipment, in the midst of a popu
lation foreisrn and estranged. Missionary
means' undivided and unabating enthusiasm
and eagerness, unceasing and undelaying dili
gence, in carrying his gospel of deliverance
and â¢ blessedness to his toiling brothers who
likewise are our own. The apostle to the na
tions in the first chapter of his greatest let
ter to the central church of the empire states
his missionary obligation, his missionary pre
paration for and his flawless missionary in
strument. - "I am- debtor: I am ready; I am
not ashamed of the gtispel of Christ."
St. Paul's doctrine is certainly that of elec
tion, but It is an election to service, an elec
tion of preparation for service and an election
of adequate equipment for its accomplishment.
St. John, gathers ud the divine motive, ini
tiatf&n and^ sacrifice, the sublime and unique
character of the missionary, the substance and
requirement of his gospel and Its world-wide
intent and provision in a single unmatched
verse of his own unequaled record: "God so
loved the world that he gave his only begot
ten son that whosoever belleveth in him. might
not perish, but have everlasting- life."
The Church, a Mission.
Missions are the mind and might of the Mas
ter multiplied into the mass and multitude of
men who measure life by the meaning of his
mediations.
The Rev. John J. Tigert, L.L. D., of
Nashville. Term., then delivered the fol
lowing address:
The Park sisters next favored the audi
ence Â¦with a cornet eolo and Â¦were encored.
"The Lost Chord" and "Take Me, Oh, My
Father" were their selections.
It - Is very ' superficial Â¦ to say - that if there

. " One of the chief foes to the progress of Chris
tianity as a spiritual. institution and a reformer
and molder of each generation is the Sunday
paper as It is. Should a Sunday paper be pub
lished Is one .' question. Should such a paper
as the Sunday paper now is in size and tn some
particulars of . character of contents be read
by Christians or admitted to their families on
Sunday. Is' another question. Are spiritual
things of â¢ such . a nature that no spiritual
preparation is necessary for their reception and
profitable consideration? i Is the man who
takes, up the Sunday paper and divides it
among the I members . of his family before or
after his late breakfast acting in harmony with
any known -law of human nature of mind or
heart, that. is, if he wishes to derive spiritual
benefit from the sanctuary? To fill the mind
with business, news, fashions, accounts" of
theatrical â¢ performances of. the night before,
scandal, party â¢ politics, comicalities, eccen
tricities and grave discussion, is this to pre
pare to draw near to â¢ God ' and seek the light,
of: his countenance? Instead of this, such per
sons are doing what Â¦ they can to deter them
selves ' and "! others, . especially young people,
from attending church, or if present in body
to cause them to be absent in sulrlt.;
. But â¢ the . church in Â¦ Its highest work ' often
finds the newspaper helping it greatly with
one hand, and holding back or crowding: Vit
aside even more greatly with the other. Its
too detailed, graphic 'and often almost sala
cious delineations of ' sin, vice and crime; its
witticisms; in treating the more solemn things
of rellglon.Mlfe. death and the future; Us flip
pant references to suicides; its reporting with
greater fullness the sayings of pulpit buffoons
and eccentrics than those of wise, well bal
anced and reverend pastors; its art vine much
more space to heterodox than to orthodox ser
mons; its making more conspicuous the utter
ances Â¦ of faddists and fanatics and the ex
crescences and exuberant exclamations of the
uncultivated Â¦ than the deep religious feeling
which . cannot be concentrated in a headline,
and ' more prominence to the sneers and asser
tions of : infidelity, than to the answers to its
allegations, . and giving more attention to
church dissensions than to its harmonies, cre
ate an atmosphere of indifference to, or distrust
of. Christianity that is hard to overcome.-
Speaking generally what the press does for
the public^includlnff the ' churchâ in the dls

Christ life. Christ did not recognize our pres

and the middle clashes. In his sight every man
by right belonged to the upper class. The
church can profitably spend less time hi look
ing Into the grave and less time In Idly gazing
up Into heaven, and more In looking* for living

For Mrs. Pape to make a 24-point shot un

she was affected greatly by the knowledge
that she was ths cynosure of all eyes and

naught but a record breaker.
Firm of hand, sharp and sure of eye.
Mason shot six of. the last eleven tickets
left him. He also tried the honorary tar
get, scoring in two shots 24 and 25. This
is phenomenal shooting and as a test
places Mason among the champion rifle
men of the world. "When the marker
wheeled the register to 24 the first time
Mason shot on the Eureka target, the
news trailed around the shooting, section
like Ignited powder. Strecker's name fall
ing from the lips of shooters and specta
tors suddenly congealed. Mason had
scored 49 out of BO while he shot from the
glass case, the "sweat box" which makes
the most expert, keen and iron men trem
ble and shake like an overworked earth
quake. Then they realized â those men
who have their eyes on the prizesâ that
Mason was a dangerous foe, full of re
source and ability. So they took to count
ing Mason tickets for the king shoot.
Mirablle dictu, it was discovered that Ma
son had an average of 19*4 out of 150 shots.
Fifty more trials are all that he is al
lowed for regal honors. The last six tick
ets he shot yesterday averaged 22 points.
Should he be able to repeat that perform- Â¦
ance any time before the festival is passed
he will put the blanket over Adolph
Strecker and receive the crown without
the peradventure of a doubt.
Mason is the blunt, cold, broadly nerved
: sort of man who rarely goes to pieces
| when "the work is heavy and the stakes
big. More than that, he possesses a fe
cund confidence in himself. He 'quit yes
terday Â¦when the labor of the day and the
excitement seemed wearing. The crowds
grew thicker and thicker in the ranges
and the Ehooter was put to the necessity
of waiting some little time before the op
portunity of rifle work, was presented.
This is the reason Mason did not shoot
his string out. He will' in all probability,
do so to-day, as his friends axe all anxious
for him to complete his score. They burn
with curiosity v over what is to be. And
now the question ie, Will It be Strecker or
Mason? . â¢ â¢

quent happenings bullded a foundation
for eternal truthful prognostication on
the part -.of Secretary Haake. -
Ladies' day was- a success â every part
of it, morning noon and night hours.
J The festivities were formally begun
during . a . postponed lunch hour with a
banquet to the officers of the National
Bundes and the representatives of the
press. In the shade of the trees the
Schuetzen ladies, the Bundes officials and
the newspaper men sat down to a ban
quet perfect in every detail. President
Kuhls acted as toastmaster until called
to the ranges by exacting duties, when he
was relieved by J. D.-Helse. The Rhine
wine gurgled out of the long neck bottles,
speeches were delivered in two different
languages between courses and all -left
the banquet board happy "in spirit and
Jo-ful In mood. *
During the ; afternoon the ladies enter
tained their friends in their o'wn arbor
with a "koffee platsch," which in Eng
lish means coffee, cakes. and gossip. This
was as pronouncedly successful as the
banquet. As a fitting climax to the day's
festivities came the ball in the evening.

electric lights, the arbors decorated and
adorned with glowing lanterns, the dance

life as an accompaniment . made, more

MAKES A. GOOD SCORE
F. C. Ross; who won the title, of schuetz
en k]ing in 1886 at the first schuetzen bund
and from whom King Hayes wrested the
laurels in 1898, tried his nerve in the "glass
sweatbox" yesterday. He shot remarka
bly well considering that he hadnotused
a gun for some time. His score for ten
shots on one ticket was 26 out" of a possi
ble 30. which tied the best score made by
Strecker on any one ticket. He followed
that up with two strings of 25 each. He
made ah average of over two on his last
IK shots/ and has still thirty of his U00
shots left. . He does not expect to equal
Streckcr, but will finish! with a very,

was . Mrs. Pape, I the wife of "Boy Won

greatly from nervousness she ; would have
tied her husband's score and caused her
self to be reckoned as one of the best
shots Â«bf the festival. Mrs. Pape fired
three shots at the honorary target yes-,
â¢terday and had her ticket punched for 50
points. She made. 24 points on her first
shot- Many marksmen who for 1 years

boxes until a late hour last night when
the music In the pavilion died a- slow

Ftrecmed out into the night air, hurrying
and scurrying for the trains that carried
them cityward. It was ladies' day, and
Â¦what a day It was! Even Sunday* the Ini

pagne compared to the celebration
which the Schuetzen ladies undertook and
carried <^ut successfully. The park,
crowded with merrymakers, all alive to
the Bltuation and full of the holiday spirit,
was a scene of effervescent life. Music,
dancing, laughter, toasting, all went hand
In hand. No tameness, no lagging interest
in the day's festivities was apparent any
where, and when the incandescent lights
blazed and glistened In the trees after
nightfall the park resounded with the Joy
ful and happy sounds of a people who
were at peace with the world and who
knew how to celebrate a national festival
occasion.
ETSW CANDIDATE FOB
HONORS OF KE1TGSHIP
This happened during the afternoon and
evening. In the morning while, the crowds
began collecting the sputtering fire on the
ranges kept up its steady punctuation hour
after hour. Adolph Strecker was on the
lips of all. The most possible ping of the
ehooting Xest was the talked about per-
Bonage. ' Was there anybody on the
grounds who could beat him? More than
one asked this question and prejudgment
had it strong: for the negative. A score of
3JÂ»4 on the point target surpassed! Impos
sible! It couid not be! So Strecker was
undisturbed in the prospective kingship,
without a pretender or a contestant.
But this unalloyed belief in Strecker re
ceived slow but steady shocks later in the
day. A. dark horse is developing on the
ranges, and even Adolph Strecker, . phe
nomenal shooter that he is, may be forced
to ewallow his boast and doff his hat and
genuflect with full obeisance to one who
Is shooting: - In demoniac fashion. F". E.
Mason is the man. A Â¦ continuation of
luck, a consistency of performance and a
sustention of nerve on Mason's part will

whose visions of the Investments of regal

Mason is the man who may steal the
un* on kinpshlp from Strecker. When the
ranges were deserted on Thursday even-
Ing Strecker was In common opinion a

all the depths and shoals of target work
and had achieved a success and renown
far beyond the glory ever attained by a

FAKTOR COMMENTS ON
STRECKER'S GREAT FEAT
D. B. Faktor, who, up to the. time of
Strecker's marvelous display of > marks
manship, was looked upon as a probable
winner of the kingly honors, in speaking
yesterday of the wonderful prowess dis
played by the world's greatest shot, said:
"Strecker's performance, ending Thurs
day, was the most marvelous target work
ever known in America. His present
score has proved that my estimate of him
Â¦was correct. The reason I formed such an
opinion of him is that he is the coolest of
all' the marksmen I have ever seen. His
score of 394, twenty-one higher than the
highest record previously known, will
stand for many years, probably for a cen
tury, perhapg^f or all time."
Faktor is well competent to give an.
opinion. He is rated as one of the great
est all-round target marksmen In the
world. He has attended and participated
in all the great shooting contests for the
last twenty years. One notable thing
about his style of shooting ia that he aims
with both eyes. One week before the
opening ot^Jthe festival, in a practice
shoot, he made sixteen straight bullseyes
on the same style of target which
Strecker punctured with such unerring
aim.
Judge Bahrs, -who is a good rifle shot
said yesterday, in reference to Strecker's
wonderful performance: "If the rifle had
been securely screwed in a vise it could
not have hit the small black center at a
distance of 600 feet v more than 197 times
out of the 200 shots fired, because some
allowance must be made even for varia
tion In the ammunition, some difference
in the loading of the shell, atmospheric
changes and other conditions." â¢

storms over the northern part of England
this evening presaged a break of the hot
wave. At Newcast\e-on-Tyne the streets
were flooded and traffio of^ all' kinds was
temporarily suspended. Thej^Hroad sys

greenhouses. The surrounding crops and
orchards were badly damaged.
In consequence of the heat London has
improvised some customs that are de

"On arriving at the scene I found the
union men greatly excited over the com
ing of the Sheriff. Alter quieting them I
Fought the Sheriff. He sent word that
he would see me at McXear's office, I
asked him how it was that he was there
with his deputies. He said that last night
ho received a telephone call from G. W.
McNear to have twenty deputies on hand
at his warehouse in the morning:, as he
Intended to put a sang of men at work
?nd feared that the strikers might make
trouble, I told him that our members
had acted like gentlemen since the strike
began: that no violence of any kin3 had
befn committed and that he had no right
to bring a lot of deputies here to intimi
date new men and excite riot among our
members."
This action on the part of tie union
leader averted trouble for the time being,
but feeling runs high over the bringing
in cf non-union men and there may be an
outbreak at anr time,
"While the Warehousemen s Union was
in session jast night," said l>ethlefson to
day, * - I received â¢ a message .from. Mar
tinez stating: teat a call had been made
on the Sheriff for protection by McNear
and that the Sheriff and twenty-two dep
uties would leave for Port Costa, on the
first train in the morning. One of the
pickets reported this morning: that a
steamer had passed the sugar house with
Â¦ large number of men aboard. Later
our boat patrol reported that there were
thirty Italians on the steamer, and that
>ne was going to McNear's.
More than 500 strikers had congregated
near McXear's warehouse and some of
the cooler ones, fearing, trouble, dis
patched a messenger for Secretary Detta
lefson of the Warehousemen's Union. He
arrived a moment later and addressed the
rsien. He cautioned them against using
violence or making .threats of any kind,
saying that the bringing of the Sheriff
here was a trick on the part of the ware
house owners to lead the men into a trap.
PORT COSTA, July 19.â Port Costa's
population was aroused this morning at 7
o'clock by the tooting of tho whistles at
Kppinger's and McNear't warehouses. A
few minutes later a steamer was seen
creeping past lhÂ« sugar refinery and hav
ing- on board an unusually large number
of men. These were landed at McNeax's
warehouse. The train from Martinez
arrived at this time and Sheriff Veal
with twenty-two deputies got off. The
Sheriff msrehed his men in regular mili
tary order down the track to McXear's
warehouse and entered. He formed a
circle with his deputies around the men
that had just been landed from the
steamer, and work was commenced. Ar
rangements have been made to house and

GUARDS A MILL
SEATTLE, July 19.â One more tragedy,
piteous in its details, caused by the awful
"white silence" of the dreary* Yukon
wastes, has come to light, and. Philip
Deiderlch, white-haired and bent with the
load of his 80 years, must stand trial at j
Nome for murder In the first degree. At J
Holy Cross Mission, April 13, 19-Jl. it is
charged. Philip Delderich shot Louis
Borub, his neighbor, through the head.
The old man, it is claimed, stole on his
victim from behind. There was no provo
cation and the main witnesses against the
decrepit prisoner are his two sons. \
'This Is the substance of the story. There
is much behind these allegations. Holy !
Cross Mission lies on the tower Yukon, j
There the stream widens, before spread- j
Ing to its delta, and the banks are more
than two miles apart. It is a desolate
spot. The dreary Arctic twilight and the
vast expanse of white plain are said to be
responsible for many grim tragedies. . It >
is said that they were the cause of old i
1'hilip Deldericb/s awful deed. j
Deiderlch and Borub lived near one an- j
other. Both had cabins, one-room affairs. I
furnished simply, provisioned with only j
actual necessities. At the coming of win
ter, so gx>es the story, the men were Arm j
friends. They wonted together in tho j
preparation of- their-wlnter quarters, and
often ' visited one another in the even
ing. Then the days began to shorteji and
the long twilight came. How the' first
quarrel â¢ sprang up is not known. It is
said to have been a trivial. affair. Delder
ich went back to his family and told them
of the quarrel, but gave no details. Borub
returned to his cabin and brooded by him
self. The two men met and failed- to
speak. Each watched the other at such
times, and each became the more suspi
cious at the other's covert glance.
Winter wore > on to a darkened sprim?.
It seemed as though the sun would never
appear. The Delderich family became
alarmed at the alteration in the old man.
They feared that the hard winter and the
lonely life were telling on his mind.
One morning Deiderlch left the cabin
with his rifle over his arm. One of his
sons saw. him from a distance and hast
ened to follow him, joined by his brother,
whom he had called. It is said that the
boys overtook their father too late. The
old man had come upon Borub when the
latter was alone. He had approached him
silently from behind, rested his rifle and
taken deliberate aim and shot his former
friend through the head. , .
Deiderich's two sons were, according to
Nome papers, being: held at St. Michael I
during the early part of July as witnesses. I
Together with the aged prisoner they had
been taken from Holy Cross Mission by
the officers, who went after them down
the river. At the time the statements of
the case were published in Nome Marshal
Griggs was in St. Michael on his way to
the mission after the rest of Deiderich's
family, all of whom are. it is said, to be
used as witnesses against him. %

Reliance, a tugboat specially chartered for our voyage of dis

weather was delightful, Just cool enough to be pleasant, the sea
as smooth as a mill pond, the sun shone brilliantly, and the

lier life was spent on the ocean wave. The committee who had
us in charge kindly indicated the different point3 of Interest On
the hills we saw the camp of the United States soldiers, the
Cliff House and Golden Gate Park; we passed the great Iron
works where the Oregon was built, and we sailed close to the
side of that magnificent vessel Itself lying securely at anchor
not far from the spot where she first entered the water. Like

Ing. Volunteers were asked for to man the boat on her first
trip under water. There were twice as many men volunteered
as were wanted. The vessel was fitted with a crew, and then
submerged. Half an hour afterward the vessel was fished up
from the muddy bottom with her entire crew of sixteen men
dead.'
The Inventor then discovered a faulty valve, and said that
when that was remedied there would be no fault in the boat.
The valve was changed and another launching took place, four
teen volunteers going down In her this time. Like their brother
jackies of the first experiment, they never agraln saw the light
of day.
It was two years before the Whale received its third and
last trial. In the meantime the inventor had made many
changes, and he assured all the spectators that "this time there
is positively no danger whatever." Notwithstanding his assur
ance, however, only twelve men dared to enter the boat and
be submerged.
. For a long time* the crowd waited to see her reappear. But
she only reappeared after twenty-five minutes, and her reap
pearance was due to her being hauled out by a derrick. The
twelve men had been dead for a good while.
Having killed forty-two men. no further experiments were
ever made. The vessel is no longer known to the jackies as the
Whale, but bears among them the more appropriate appella
tion of "The Man-Killer." *
Ti HE Brooklyn navy yard simply teems with relics and
curiosities of absorbing Interest, says the New York Mall
* and Express. There is a navy museum on the grounds,
with curios of every description, but the curio par ex
cellence of the yard is a large hulk of iron rotting with
rust In a remote and unfrequented corner of the grounds hav
ing no connection whatever with the museum. Thia curio is the
first submarine boat ever made in this^ country.
The Whale is the' odd name of this boat. Nothing could be
more appropriate, for the vessel is bulky, ugly and clumsy. The
story of the Whale is one of the most tragic chapters in the
history of the yard.
She was built during the Civil War, in the early sixties, and
wonderful things were expected of her. The designer of the
vessel got Congress Interested in his plan, and the Government
made a large appropriation for the building of the boat. Not
only did the Government and the designer expect that naval
warfare was about to be revolutionized, but the people through
out the whole country as well, much having been published
about the vessel in the newspapers. The designer had an idea
that ho would go down In history as another Ericsson. Instead
of that, however, his name has gone to oblivion, and there is
not an officer or jacky at the yard who can recall his name.
The vessel was a long time in construction. - .When, finally,
she was completed, arrangements were made for a gala launch-
ALABAMA EDITORS DESCRIBE THE CALIFORNIANS
I AS MOST HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF ALL IN THE LAND
MR. LUSK of California, president of the
American Cattle-growers' Association,, re
cently attended the slated meeting of the
board of control of that organization at Denver.
The association was found to be increasing to such
an extent that the board decided to omit the annual
assessment per head of stock represented, and to
recommend its entire abolition by the next conven
tion, relying upon membership fees for what funds it
requires.
The.meeting discussed the leasing of the ranges on
the public domain in the arid region. On this sub
ject Mr. Lusk said: "There has been a complete
change as to the leasing question in the last year.
A year, ago many opposed leasing, but stockmen gen
erally now realize that free grass means no grass at
all. Stockmen are willing to pay for what they get.
They realize that the open range is a bygone thing,
and now the only question is the detail of the new
law.' The sheep men, too, are swinging into line with
the cattle men on the proposition, and I think when
the bill is presented we shall find the stockmen of
the West 'united solidly in demanding its enactment
into law. Sheep men and cattle men now are strug
gling for possession of the little grass that is left,
while if the lands were properly protected there would
be plenty for all and some. left over.", - :Â¦- :~\r
No truer and terser statement can be made. Free
grass means no grass. No grass means disappearance
of the most economical production of livestock, and
that means a progressive rise in price of all livestock
products, to the injury of the consumer. '
It is reassuring, Joo, to read the declaration that
stockmen are Villing to pay for what they get. . It
means a better understanding between that great
interest and the ijublic, who are the owners of the
public domain.
The Call pioneered for the leasing policy against
the. opposition of the stockmen, and we will freely
criticize the leasing measure to the end that it shall
conserve all interests and injure none. We have here
tofore estimated that it will yield about ten millions
a year for devotion to irrigation. We have recently
seen a statement by a cattle man in Nebraska that
leasing will yield twenty-five millions annually, which
we regard as excessive, at least in the initial stages of
the policy. The revenue may, however, approximate
that as the beneficent and conservative results appear
in the increased moisture, forage and capacity of the
ranges.
. The prospect to the irrigator is alluring. The rev
enue of the leases, devoted to irrigation, will even
tually more than double the production, and popula
tion of the West. It will make fertile, -every tillable
acre that stored and distributed water can reach. It
will increase the. taxable property and wealth of all
these States, enhance the commercial importance of
their towns, make necessary the building of more
railroads to carry the increased tonnage to market,
and will multiply the power of the West in the Na
tional Government.

as to his powers under the law has concluded to go as
far as he can toward applying a remedy for the evil.
In order to exclude fake publications without ex
cluding any that are legitimate there is to be' a rigid
investigation of mail matter and .the various publi
cations will-be judged on their merits. A recent re
port from Washington says: "It is explained at
the Postoffice Department that it is not the inten
tion to refuse second class rates to legitimate publica
tions. â¢ They have not constituted a burden upon the
postal facilities of the country. The department's
action will be aimed against cheap publications, which
make offers of premiums evidently of more value than
the publication itself." The Postoffice Department
does not wish to injure the business of those pub
lications that give value received for their subscrip
tion price and yet operate premium schemes. It only
aims to correct abuses which, for instance, have de
veloped in offers of merchandise worth $1 and a prac
tically worthless publication whose subscription price
ostensibly is $1." ; * \". .
We believe that every legitimate publisher will ap
prove the action taken by the Postmaster General.
In fact, it has .been announced that representatives of
many of .the leading publications of the country have
visited Washington and after consultation with the
officials have been ; convinced that the proposed
changes would not injure any legitimate publication
and have since lent a hearty support to the new rule.
Now that so nuich ; has been accomplished it re
mains for Congress to complete the work. There; is
no reason why the Postoffice Department" should not
be self-supporting. Many improvements- that will in
crease its benefits to the public can -be made when
once the abuses of second class mail privileges have
been stopped. The fight for redress has been a long
one, and it is gratifying to' see at last that victory
is -in sight.
are possessed of excellent and some of them of su
perior qualities. It is a worthy work to turn their in
dulgence into a harmless channel that will not de
stroy the good in them, but permit its growth and
permanence. Such considerations no doubt influence
the views of Bishop Potter, as they do all non
fanatical investigators of the subject.
Now let us see if the Bishop will be accused of
being the tool of the liquor sellers and the War De
partment in spreading falsehoods as facts.
BISHOP POTTER, in a recent putyic expres- ;
sion, took the same ground toward the army
canteen controversy that The Call has taken,
and affirmed as facts the news items which have ap
peared in our column's, giving in detail the results of
abolishing the canteen at army posts near cities,
where at present the large posts are maintained.
Bishop Potter is one of the most eminent church
men in the United States, an'd in the hierarchical sys-.
tern of his church might be called its American Pri
mate, for its most populous and important commu
nions are in his diocese.
His character is of the highest type and his judg
ment of the best quality. Accustomed to investiga
tion and .with" a knowledge of human nature and the
highest of humane feelings, his conclusions always de
serve and receive the respect of his countrymen, no
matter what their denominational relations, or lack
of them. He is not jumping at conclusions, nor
thinking with his prejudices, nor speaking in the lan
guage of fanaticism, when he says that Congress was
influenced to abolish the canteen in the interest
the rum seller, and that its abolition has already pro
duced the saddest of disorder and immorality. It is
worth remembering in this connection that a com
mittee of clergymen in Chicago visited Fort Sheri
dan and made a report of naked facts as to the fringe
of deadfalls around the post and their patronage by
the enlisted men. That report did not bear out the
statements of Rev. Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Hurst,
and was, we believe, received without comment by
the ministers' meeting to which it was made.
The Call does not make great professions of a de
sire to recast humanity, albeit in a higher mold. But
if it be thought well to* guard and guide the morals
of .the, tens of thousands of enlisted men in our
army, we are convinced that their indulgence in an
appetite for alcoholic drink, which seems to be the
common infirmity of ' primitive and civilized man,
should be put under the restraint of the army can
teen, unless that appetite prove eradicable altogether.
As, in the mass, of mankind, eradication has never
been accomplished, why is it not wise, moral, useful,
religious, if you please, to protect it from becoming
a disease, and the medium of other diseases, and de
stroying its unfortunate victim, physically and mor
ally? Every old army officer knows the terrors of
the post deadfall, its evil effect upon the men and
its interference with' discipline. Many, a majority of
officers, have noted the change that came with the
post canteen. The name is expressive but unfortu
nate. Scores of ignorant fanatics assumed that it
meant that the Government was dealing out to the
soldiers canteens filled with whisky. Of course the
more intelligent opponents of the change from bad
whisky to light wine and beer knew better, but the
error brought them recruits.
The change was good, and its effects justified it.
The canteen was the enlisted man's club. It furnished
him a reading-room and library. It protected him
against squandering his pay. It kept him from con
tact with the indescribable moral degradation and
debauchery to which the deadfall is the open door.
In our army an enlisted man may win his way to
the supreme command. General Miles did" that.
Shafter and a majority of the major generals and
brigadiers began in the ranks. The canteen library
may furnish works on military history and tactics
which such enlisted men as have ambitions may.,
study. The army is a democratic institution in which'
a raw recruit may aspire to the generalcy, and may
reach the post filled by Scott, Grant, Schofield and
Miles. But he can never reach it, through the dead
fall.
, We make no apology for any one who constantly,
or occasionally abandons himself to liquor, but it. is
a matter of common observation that many who do
PACT AND FANATICISM. /
Peru is making extraordinary preparations for war
and the fearful ones among her citizens are wonder

Experience teaches that fiery Peru will know that she
has been in a fight no matter with whom she goes to

Under any circumstances the rank and file of the
Republican party in San Francisco have nothing to
fear from the struggle that is ahead of them. Even
if the State Committee side with the bosses and defy
the people; even if Herrin and Burke and the South
ern Pacific push be allowed a free hand, in support
ing the disreputable gangs with which they are now
associating, the better elements of the party can win
if they will but give due attention to their political
duties. They far outnumber the predatory classes
that have rallied to the support of the bosses. Since
honest elections at the primaries are assured under
the law, all that good men have to do to win is to go
to the polls and vote. The one thing to be done,
then, is to organize and prepare for election day. The
support of the bosses is noisy and vicious, but it is
not dangerous when good citizens are combined
If, however, the State Committee for any reason
or lack of reason should intrude itself into city poli
tics and give support to the Kelly and Crimmins
crowd, the result will not materially strengthen the
gang. It is no longer in their power to bulldoze
primaries. Since the order of President Hays W. F.
Herrin and the Southern Pacific push are not so po
tent as they used to be. It is true the order for one
cause or another is not being strictly enforced, but
nevertheless the order is there, and some day the at
tention of President Hays may be called to its viola
tion, and then the men who are now mocking at him
may have occasion to regret it
The bosses have asserted that in appealing to the
State Committee they have a sure thing. They be
lieve they, have a sufficient pull to be able to bring
over to their side the members of the State Commit
tee and obtain such a decision as they choose. . It is
quite possible they may be mistaken. A majority of
the committee may refuse to do the bidding of the
bosses. It is well known that the rank and file of the
Republican party will not submit to boss domination;
that a strong majority of the party believes this to be
a favorable time for the elimination of the bosses
altogether, and consequently many members of the
State Committee may place themselves on the side
of the people, despite all that Kelly and Herrin
may do.
Before the adoption of a valid primary election law
Kelly and Crimmins had need of no further help
than that which Herrin and Burke or other politi
cians of the Southern Pacific were willing to give
in return for favors expected and demanded. They
could carry primaries by the simple process of ob
taining gangs of rowdies and plug uglies from the
Democratic camp to join their own gangs in creating
disorder and giving opportunity for fraud in stuffing
ballot-boxes. Under the new law the old tactics can
not be employed, and consequently something more
is required than W. 1 F. Herrin and an assorted lot of
hoodlums. Kelly and Crimmins have therefore turned
to the members of the State Central Committee and
asked them to put their hands in the fire of local poli
tics to' rake out the chestnuts.
THE SUPPORT OF THE BOSSES.
WITH a combination made up of every sort
of dement that can be rallied to their sup
port, Kelly and Crimmins are once more
making a fight for such a position in the Republican
party as will enable them to do politics profitably to
themselves. Their combination includes such men
as John C. Lynch, W.'F. Herrin and Jere Burke. It
also includes opium fiends, ex-convicts and the gen
eral rabble of toughs and roughs who in the past
conld be counted on to dominate primaries by force
or fraud.
It is reported that the cost of handling second class
mail under the present abuse of the system amounts
to about $60,000,000;- that in weight it constitutes
three-fourths of the entire mail, and yet it yields only
$4,000,600 out of the $110,000,000 of revenues derived
from the service as a whole. The Postmaster General
purposes to exclude the fake periodicals from the sec
ond class mails. Congress should have undertaken

Despite this plain statement of the law abuses
crept in. Publishers of cheap and trashy novels
adopted a plan of publishing them as a series, issued
periodically. Advertising fakers followed the example
and began issuing their publications periodically. The
consequence has been that the Government has been
compelled to carry through the mails at second class
rates a large amount of matter which of right should
never have been admitted to that class.
POSTMASTER GENERAL SMITH'S deter
mination to exclude from the privilege of sec
ond class mail rates certain panlphlets and
papers whichare in no sense justly entitled to them
has naturally aroused the men who" have been for so
long a time profiting by the abuse of the privilege.;
These men have already begun an agitation against
the new rule. The country as a whole, however, will
.approve the order and support it as a measure of
economy and of justice which should have been taken
long ago.
The Call has repeatedly advocated a revision of the
postal laws in that respect along the lines of the Loud
bill, which has been the subject of so much discus
sion in Congress and out of it. The law of, 1879 in
describing the class of publications entitled to sec
ond class rates says: "It must be originated and pub
lished for the dissemination of information of a pub
lic character, or devoted to literature, the sciences,
arts or some special industry, and having a legitimate
list of subscribers; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall be so construed as to admit to
second class rate regular publications designed pri
marily for advertising purposes, or for free circula
tion, or for circulation at v a nominal price." v

able to find the place . again, nor have
hundreds of searching expeditions since
been able to . do so. The miners named
believe the rich diggings are located in

Siskiyou border. In addition to numerous
similar landmarks, Le May is said to have
discovered a blazed tree in the almost in
accessible region. The Lost Cabin discov

The Belvedere had made a big catch,
having taken nine whales. The Karluk,
had one and the others were clean.
When the tug was lying at St. Michael
the river steamers Monarch, Susie, Tyr
rell, Lightning and John P. Knight were
there with others whose names could not
be remembered. They had brought down
more than 2000 passengers from Dawson
to Cape Nome and from some of the pas
sengers Captain Cutler learned that quite
a stampede had set in from the Klondike
to the American camp. A number of
whalers were reported. The Belvedere,
the William Bayliss, the Karluk and the
Jeanette were at St. Michael coaling, and
when the tug called at Dutch Harbor on
July 11 she spoke the Fearless, which had
taken one. whale off the F'arweather
Grounds and reported having ?7000 worth
of bone.
News was given by the tug of the wreck
of one of the otter hunting fleet off San
niac, a point between Shumagin Island
and Unimak Pass. They generally used
this entrance to the Bering Sea, The
schooner was seen stranded on the beach
while Captain Cutler was towing his fleet
of three barges to St. Michael. She was
full of water and seemingly deserted. He
did not go in to make inquiries. That she
was one of the otter hunters he was al
most certain. Â¦ ' .

learned from Indians who had come in
from a point twenty miles up from St.
Michael that the bodies of five white men
had been found lying in the â¢ ice. Two
were lying on . their | sled, with the frozen
bodies of their dogs still harnessed to the
sled, and three others were found along
the trail further on, some distance sep
arating them from one another. The In

GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo., July 19.â
an oil operator in the Beaumont fields,
was here to-day. He says that he was at
Sabine, a few miles south of Beaumont,
yesterday and was driven from the place
by a plague of mosqultces.
The mosquitoes came from adjacent salt
marshes in great clouds, wh!ch "darkened
the %ht of the sun. The insects settled
down on Sabine, &nd the workmen who
were employed in constructing the oil
pipeline ot the Lone Star and Crescent
Company were forced to flee for their
lives. Al> work was puspended and the
people tock refuge under mosquito bars,
where they remained all day.
Many head of cattle, horses and other
animals were killed by the insects. Welsh
states that th<? mosquitoes were so thick
it was impossible to breathe in the open
air. It is the worst plague of mosquiioes
ever experienced on the Texas coast

Nine Vessels In From the Islands
With IÂ«arge Cargoes..
A fleet of nine vessels carrying nearly
16,000 tons of 6Ugar arrived in port yester
day. The Diamond Head, with 23,2&4 bags
aboard, was the first to get in. All of the
vessels were outside in a bunch Thursday
night, but the Diamond Head was the
first to get ths- breeze and come in. She
was followed in by the Marion Chilcott
with 41.432, the Olympic with 38,081, the
St. Katherine with 31,509, the Consuelo
with 7202, the Kailua with 22,646, the
George Curtis Â¦with 48,828, the Transit with
15,300 and the Santiago with 27,100.
The best run was made by the brig Con-
Buelo, which came up from Mahukona in
seventeen and one-half days. The next
best was the four-masted bark Olympic,
twenty days from Honolulu, while the
schooner Transit was close up with twen
ty-one days from Kahului. The longest
run of all was the bark St. Katherine.
She was thirty-three days coming here
from Hilo. For that matter, every one
of the passages is long, and there is not
one of the fleet that has not made the
same run within twelve days.
BIG STJGAB FLEET ABJUVES.
AVERT Interesting If not exciting
ocean race was finished yester
day. Four of the vessels made
port so nearly together that the
captains have decided to call the
contest a draw.
The ships Marion Chilcott and George
Curtis sailed from Honolulu on June 26.
The same day the bark Santiago left Hilo
for this port and the schooner "William
Bowden left Honolulu for Puget Sound.
Early yesterday morning the Chilcott
passed in, and a few hours later she was
followed by the Curtis and the Santiago.
These vesels had barely their anchors
down before the Bowden was reported
passing Neah Bay. The passage of twen
ty-three days is. a long one, but. none of
the captains are grumbling, when they
consider that one vessel was as slow as
the other.
The Marion Chilcott is now owned in
San Francisco. She was formerly the
British, ship Kilbrannan. and was wrecked
in Puget Sound. She was condemned and
sold to Barneson & Chilcott, who raised
and repaired her. Later she obtained an
American registry and made several trips
from the Sound to Australia for her new
owners. Then she was used as a freight
transport by the Government, and again
went back into the Australian trade.
While on her way from Newcastle, Aus
tralia, to Honolulu she was purchased by
"William Matson and will be added to his
Hllo fleet of clippers. The Santiago
which made the run from Hilo in twenty.
three days, also belongs to Captain Mat
son's fleet.
Captain "vTeeden, who brought the Ma
rlon Chilcott here, will leave the vessel as
Boon as she is taken over by her new
owner, and Captain Rock will probably
take command for one voyage.
Secretary of Wavy Takes Exception
to Maclay's Volume.
â¢VTASHIXGTON. July 19.â The Secretary
Â©f the Navy nas decided that the third
volume of Maclay's history of the Span
ish-American War shall not be used as a
text book at the naval academy unless
the obnoxious langruage it contains in
characterizing the action of Rear Admiral
Schley is eliminated. The Secretary says
it would be manifestly improper to have
a history containing such intemperate
language as a text book for the cadets
He will inform both Commander Wain
Â¦nripht. who is in command of the naval
Ecaaemy, and Maclay. the author, of his
decision. In his decision the Secretary
says the contents of the entire volume
were not submitted to him by the his
torian. He received only the proofs of
the third chapter, that relating to the
mobilizing of the fleets, which contained
the summary of the orders which he as
gecretary of the Navy, had issued in
making: the naval preparations for the
war. That chapter was satisfactory, and
he returned it to Maclay with an indica
tion of his approval. He says he never
saw the account of the battle of San
tiago and the criticisms of Rear Admiral
Schley until after the book was published.
Maclay was appointed to his present posi
tion in the New York Navy Yard August
13, 169S, having been transferred from the
lighthouse service.
NOT APPBOVED BY IX>NO.
William McKinley. President. Canton. Ohio:
Maclay's History of the Navy Is the standard
in use at the Naval Academy. In the third
volume, just issued, the historian charges Rear
Amlral Echley with being- a coward, a liar, a
caitiff, an Incompetent subordinate. In an in
terview in' the American this morning, Mac
lay, the historian, who Is a Navy Department
clerk, classed as a laborer and attached to the
Brooklyn Navy Tard. eays that the proofs of
this third volume, which should have told the
most glorious story in all our naval annals,
were submitted to Secretary Long and Admiral
Sampson and approved by them in advance of
publication; also that L>ong put him in his
present position after he had read and ap
proved this scurrilous attack upon Admiral
Rchley. These proofs were also submitted to
Admiral Schley. who refused to read them. If
aupht were needed to convince any fair-minded
man that a clique In the ICavy Department has
conspired to traduce the hero of Santiago, and
that the conspiracy was carried . into execution
while that brave and gallant officer was Buf
fering expatriation in the fever-infested coasts
of South America, this should furnish it. Will
you, Mr. President, in view of all this. Bit
quietly by and permit these conspirators to
continue their diabolical work? Every Justice
loving, American appeals to you to Intervene
in the name and for the sake of fair play.

man ever was. the best thing Is to find out as
eoon as possible that you are wrong and right
yourself Immediately. FELIX ANGUS.

Extension of Mission Wharf.
The work of extending Mission-street
wharf 200 ' feet was Ijegun yesterday.
Washington-street' wharf has already
been completed, and when Mission is ex
tended no work in that direction will be
done on the other wharves for some time
to come. The object of extending Wash
ington and Mission street- wharves was to
do away as much as possible with the
tides at the ferries. The ebb and ' flow
now makes it hard work docking the fer
ry steamers, but the extension of the
wharves will break the force of the cur
rent and make dockln? easy.

W CLAYTON PICKERSGILL,
who for nearly three years
has acted as the Consular
O representative of the Bril-
ish Government at this
port, died early yesterday morning at a
private sanatorium in Alameda. His death
is ascribed by Dr. F. W.d'Evelyn, the at
tending physician, to African fever, con
tracted In the discharge of his duties in
the Independent Congo State several
years ago.
Early last May Mr. Pickersglll was
taken Â«sick with a recurrence of the mal
ady that once before almost proved his un
doing. He partially recovered and took a
trip to the Santa Cruz Mountains, hoping
that the change of climate would further
benefit him. About ten days ago he suf
fered te. relapse and was hurried to Ala
meda. He lingered until 9:30 o'clock yes
terday morning, his wife and eldest son
being present at his bedside when the end
came.
As soon as the news of his death was
received in this city, the flag on the Con
sulate General was lowered to half mast,
as were also the flags on the British ships
in the harbor. All the representatives of
the consular corps called at his late of
fice to leave their condolences. The body
will be removed to his late residence in
Ban Rafael for the funeral, which will
take place on Sunday afternoon. It is In
tended at present not to have any public
ceremony, but as Mr. Pickersgill was so
well liked and was so closely allied with
the English colony it is not improbable
that his widow, will consent to a change
in ihe plans now proposed. The consular
corps and captains* of the British ships
hero have expressed a desire to . pay a
last tribute of respect.
Mr. Pickersgill has had a long and varied

leges in Manchester. In 1873 he was sent
to Madagascar as the agent of the Lon
don Missionary Society, remaining there
until 18S2. He accompanied the Malagas
sy Embassy as interpreter the following
year.
In 1S83 the British Foreign Office sent
him as Vice Consul to Antananarivo, Mada
gascar, where he remained for nine years.
From 18?2 to 1898 he served as Consul to
the Portuguese possessions on the west
coast of Africa, and also to the Indepen

Lest Wednesday evening LÂ«asure called
at the lodglng-nouse and aÂ«ked the lana
ladv for a room. He was shown one for
fifty cents per night and handed the land

same time: "To-morroTC I am going to
the bank to get some money.". The next
day che called at his room to collect the
rent, but he told her that he was sick and
that he did not wish to be disturbed. \es
terday two strangers went to his room

BRITISH CONSUL GENERAL
PICKERSGILL SUCCUMBS
African Fever in Congo Free State Years Ago
Undermines His Constitution, Finally Causing Death.
His Long and- .Honorable Career Wins Government Favor
Charles Schwarts, who does the honors
at second base for the San Francisco ag
gregation of ball players, had the pleas
ure of scoring , the only run in the game
yesterday between the locals arid the nine
from Oakland. Hits were also very
scarce. Both teams played good ball.
Oakland started off like a team that in
tended winning the game. Drennah se
cured, a base on balls, and Moore sacri
ficed, advancing Drennan to second.
Streib then hit a grpunder to Krug, who
retired Drennan at the plate. '.'Truck"
Eagan next solved one of Iburg's myster
ies,' getting a single on it. With two men
on bases, Dunleavy lined the ball down lo
Pabst, who accepted It and made a pret
ty double play unassisted. This ended
Oakland's first chance of securing a run.
Uncle Hank's men could do nothing bet
ter in their half than to get a couple of
men on the bases. This availed them
nothing, as the side was quickly retired,
being unable to secure a hit or a pass
from Hodson.
Both sides were retired in auick time
for the next five innings. The Dudes had
succeeded In getting within striking dis
tance of the home station, but as usual
the fates were against them, and their
hopes of scoring were rudely shattered.
Arrellanes rapped out aT)retty double in
the second inning, but even that went for
nothing, as the rest of the team failed to
bring him in.
The Germans took the lead in the
seventh., Schwartz made a pretty bunt,
and beat It out. Captain Pabst failed to
hit safely, as likewise did -Krug,. so the
fans began- to Bhow visible fear that
.Schwartz would be left on first after his
clever bunt and run. Nordyke took his
position at the bat, and endeared him
self to the patrons of the game by send
ing out a beautiful double, to the right
garden and bringing Frisco's noisy sec
ond baseman in, going himself to third on
Franck's error on the throw in. It was
San Francisco's time to shout and make
noise. Nordyke, however, died on third,
as "Josh" Reilly failed to connect with
the sphere, making the third out.
Both pitchers were very effective, keep-
Ing the hits well scattered, and showing
good control. Hodson was hit safely but
three times, two of the hits occuring in
the seventh. He struck out five men and
gave two free tickets to first. Iburg held
the Dudes down to four hits, struck out
four men and walked three.
"Josh" Reilly made a sensational one
handed catch of Moore's hard foul In the
third. Francks.and Moore also accepted
hard chances, each taking one that looked
like a safe hit. '
The same teams will play the third
game of the series this afternoon. Follow

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The British ship Mooltan arrived fron
Valparaiso yesterday after a passage o:
fifty-eight days. She will load wheat foi
Europe. : . '.
The new steam' schooner Olympic was
successfully launched at Grays Harbor
yesterday. She is for the lumber trade.
The steamer Simon J. Murphy has been
purchased in the East by the Dollar
Steamship Company. She is now loading
at Baltimore for San Francisco. Captain
Gow, who went. East to bring' out the
steamship M. S. Dollar, will command the
Simon J,. Murphy.
Captain Lockhart has started again for
Nome in his little schooner Helen. About
six weeks ago the boat and her crew left
here for the gold 'fields, but brought up at
San Diego. The Helen was overhauled
while at the southern port and a. fresh
start was made yesterday. Lockhart and
his companions expect to make Nome be
fore winter. - \ â¢
Water Front Notes.
A peculiar accident which ~~ will end
probably In a fatality occurred on, the
bay yesterday. Four boys, while rowing
past Black Point about 2. p. m., were fired
upon from the beach and one of them
was struck'^ over the* heart by a bullet.
The wounded lad wafe sent to the Central
Hospital, but the surgeons were" unable
to . locate the bullet. The chances are
against his recovery. Â¦ .
Paul Wissig, 16 years old, whose home
is at 1224 Union street, is the wounded
boy. ' \ Â¦ ' " - Â¦
Yesterday young Wissig, Fred Kelley,
Arthur Manning and John Shipley se
cured a Whitehall at' North Beach arid
went for a row. When 100 yards off Black
Point some ona flred at them with a par
lor, rifle from the beach. Wissig, who was
at the oars,, quickened his stroke as the
bullet passed o'vef his head. The rifle
spoke again and a bullet struck Wissig
under the right arm in a line with the
nipple. ."
Wissig droppe dthi oars and. fell in the
bottom - of the boat. His companions
rowed back to Meiggs wharf and from
there the : wounded lad was sent to the
hospital. '
Some one has. been ..practicing, on* pass
ing Whitehatts rom. : '.the Black Point
beach for weeks' past. !One "Whitehall now
at North Beach has "two bullet holes in
her and another has three. -The boat
which Wissig was rowing also shows. the
marks of flying missiles. The shooting of
young Wissig will probably put an end to
the malicious practice of firing on boats.
Mystery Surrounds the
Wounding of Paul â¢

Word was received here to-day that a
considerable shipment of Welsh plate is
now on the water en route to New York.
It is reported that a portion of this will
come here if the shortage continues. It
Â¦will be much more costly than the Amer
ican make, but the exigencies of some of
the local consumers are so imperative
that they will pay no attention to cost. If
long continued, the strike la sure to be a
good thing for the Welsh makers, whose
trade for some time has been in an apa
thetic condition.
Pressure brought : to bear along this
line, the strikers say. Is energy wasted,
as they are more determined to-night
than before. They are more than angry
with the. merchants. These Wellsville
men have been considered excellent work
men, and many of them have money in
vested In property there, so that, should
the mill be taken to Vandergrift, as !s
threatened, they would suffer. They do
not believe the promise, which accom
panies the threat, that the mill from
Denison, O., will be brought to this place
in case the present trouble is settled.
From the storm-center"- at -Wellsville,
O., to-night comes word that the*striking
mlllmen in" that vicinity spent an' uneasy,
restless day. There is no longer any;
doubt that the owners of the Wellsville
plant of American Sheet Steel Com
pany have many of the town's largest
merchants back of them in their fight
against the workmen, and much bitter
ness has resulted. Confronted with what
seems a certainty that if the present
trouble goes along much farther the
Wellsville plant will be lifted and brought
across the line into Pennsylvania, groc
ers, clothing men and others who for
years have received the wages of the mill
workers in exchange for goods, are now
trying to bIiow the strikers that they are
wrong and foolish in keeping up the
nght.
PITTSBURG. Pa., July 19.â The strike

Meetings of both the Draymen's Associ
ation and the Brotherhood of Teamsters
were, held last night, but no definite re
sults, were reached. The meeting of the
Draymen's Association was largely at

One of the latest possibilities in the
strike line is one which may Involve the
car conductors and gripmen employed by
the Market-street Railway Company.
For some time past a number of employes
on the various lines formed the idea of
organizing a union and proceeded to en
list the'eo-operatloh of their fellow work
men. The matter was carried on very
Quietly "and a provisional" union was
formed. A few meetings were held and
things were progressing . smoothly,, many
of.tne employes agreeing to Join. â¢
Just haw far the organizaÂ£ion-had pro
gressed no one seems to know. On Tues
day, however, ,Lome of tho officers of the
Market-street Railway Company, notified
nlno of their employes on the Powell arid
Sacramento street lines that their ser
vices would no longer be required. Among
these were some of the oldest employes
of tho company. This was followed the
following day by the discharge of sixteen
more men.. When an explanation was de
manded the men were not, given much
satisfaction, but were told in parables
what a terrible thing it was to belong to
a union and its evil effects upon .the
workingman and his employer. The men
were rather surprised at the action taken
and the discovery of their plans. How
ever, being out of % the employ of the
company, they have since been Inciting
the working employes to unite with them
and tie up the entire system.
None of the conductors or gripmen ap
proached last night would . discuss the
question of a car employes' union or
whether they would make. a demand for
additional pay. But the twenty-five dis
charged men ar,e energetic in working up
the matter and may, with outside assist
ance, succeed in accomplishing their ends.
Local labpr leaders profess not to know
of the existence of such a union.

HOLD HIS UNO
>ti^HE Republican State Committee
I will meet at 2 o'clock this after
â¢ noon at Golden Gate Hall on Sut
1L ter streÂ«U The meeting was
called on petition of Augustus
Tilden, chairman of the Kelly-Crlmmins
County Committee. The bosses noting the
growing strength and Influence of the Re
publican Primary League, and fearing
that good citizens composing -the league
membership would give a finishing stroke
to bossism ""at . the primary election on
August 13, ap^ealed for help to the State
Committee. The fact is obvious that the
members of the State Committee have
been called together to bolster up and
stimulate the lowest grade of bossism In
California. The contest In which the com
mittee is called to interfere is purely mu
nicipal. There are no State functions to
perform. There is no party ticket to rec
ognize, for under the primary election law
the party column is left blank for names
to be filled in or pasted on the ballot. A
pretense was put forward that the Elec
tion Commissioners of San Francisco de
sired the committee to decide a question
as to the apportionment of delegates. The
Election Commissioners asked nothing of
the kind. The petitioners f6r the meeting
of the State body axe the bosses behind
the Tilden committee and the respondents
are the bosses in the State Committee.
- . Representation by Proxy.
Members of the State governing body
who live in the interior will not as a rule
attend the meetings in person. The rep
resentation will be largely by proxy, yet
the spectacle will be .presented of dele
gates representing Lassen, Humboldt,
Los Angeles. San Diego. Shasta. Modoc,
Amador, Calaveras, Tehama, San Ber
nardino and other counties assembling
for the purpose of fixing the appointment
of a municipal convention in San Fran
cisco. Last night Judge Mclvinley and
Walter Parker of Los Angeles were con
sidering what was best or worst for this
city. It makes but little difference
whether the Bouvier or Tilden committee
shall be recognized, as both pass out of
existence in a few months. "
The session of the State Committee this
afternoon promises to be animated. It is
known that leading Republicans who are
profoundly impressed with the belief that
bossism should be eliminated from the
party councils will enter a vigorous pro
test "against this scheme to indorse Kelly
and Crimmins as the representatives of
the Republican party in San Francisco.
The agitation for interference by the
Among the 'well-known public men at
the Palace Hotel are Thomas Flint Jr.,
San Juan: John F. Davis. Amador: Dr.
Chester Rowell, Fresno; W. C. Ralston,
Calaveras: Mayor Snyder and Judge Mc-
Kinley, Los TA.ng-eles, and Z. B. West,
Oranje.
Anti-boss clubs recently organized in the
Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Assem
bly districts, the old strongholds of Kelly
and Crimmins, are dally receiving large
accessions of membership. Anti-boss vic
tory in the Twenty-nintn District is al
ready assured, and the work of enroll
ment Is proceeding with unusual rapidity
In the Twenty-eighth District.
At headquarters of the Primary League,
930 Market street, cheering reports come
from every district. It is known to the
taxpayers and other representatives of
good citizenship that an alliance has been
formed by Sam Rainey and Martin Kelly,
by which, the former agrees to -help out
his old boss' partner with reinforcements
of Democratic push. In the struggle for
good local government the people of San
Frariclsco have other foes than .those in
the Republican State Central Committee,
hence there should be a movement toward
consolidating all the independent ." anti
boss Republican clubs for the .battle to be
fought on -August 13. . â¢ -'â¢
It is regarded as significant that Gov
ernor Gage has passed most of his time
at the Palace Hotel in this city since the
State Committee resolved to interfere in
local affairs. It is also noted that Daniel
Kevane, secretary, and Walter Parker,
expert of the State Board of Examiners;
Adjutant General Seamans, Eddie Conroy,
Johnny Mackenzie, Ben Fehnemah, Dr.
Lavrtor, H. W. Dinkelspiel and others of
the State administration coterie are act
ively engaged in this locality. Promises
of employment on the water front have
been given to induce party workers to get
in behind Kelly and Crimmins in the local
contest. It is common belief In political
circles that Governor Gage is giving coun
tenance and support to the Dosses who
are combining to loot this city.
Anti-Boss Clubs.
State Committee did not besrln until Kel
ly and Crimmins saw plainly that the
Primary League, composed of reputable
Republican citizens, was extending its
Influence for good local government to
every district In the city. In the appeal
for outeide help the bosses admitted tnelr

HARD TO BREAK.
But tlie Coffee Habit Can Be Put Off.
"I was a coffee user from early child-^
hood, but It finally made me so nervous
that I spent a great many sleepless
night3, starting at every sound I heard
and suffering with a continual dull head-
ache. My hands trembled and I was aJso
troubled with shortness of breath and pal-
pitation of the heart. The whole system
showed a poisoned condition and I was
told to leave oft coffee, for that was the
cause of ll I was unable to break myself
of the habit until some one Induced me
to try -Postum Food Coffee, g
"The first trial the Food Coffee was Cat
and tasteless and I thought it was horrid
stuff, but xny friend urged me to try again :
and let it boll longer. This time I had a
very delightful* beverage and have been
enjoying it ever since, and am now in a
very greatly improved condition of health.
"My brother is also using Postum in-
stead of coffee, and a friend of ours, Mr.
\V., who was a great coffee user, found
himself growing more and more nervous
and was troubled at times with dizzy
spells. His wife suffered with nausea and
r indigestion, also from coffee. They lefÂ£
it off and have been using Postum Food
Coffee for some time and are now in a
perfect condition of health." Grace C.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July IS.â The character of to
dsy'n stock market was much the same as
lhat of yesterday, but there was a conspicuous
abser.ee of the late enormous demand which
lifted Union Pacific yesterday ln the closing
dealings. The volume of transactions was
rather larger than yesterday, but the market
was nevertheless highly professional. Much
Â¦liquidation had to be absorbed by those who
had set themselves the task of supporting the
market and the burden seemed to be too heavy
to carry- Prices brckc through support ln the
late dealings and the market closed weak at
the lowest of the day. Even those stocks which
had shown strength Ouring the day had very
little left to show in the way of gains, and
'the stocks which were conspicuous for strength
ypstfnJay were conspicuously weak. The stocks
s elected as props for the market to-day seemed
to be principally among the Southern rail
roads and the Gould Southwestern*. Included
with the latter were Western Union and Man
hattan. Texas and Pacific was at one time
three points over laÂ« night ana there was
large buying in Missouri Pacific. United Slates
Ptficl stocks seemed to 1 be well under control
by insiders and they were marked up shaiply
ov*r a point each during the period of strength
lp the xn&rlcet. The puÂ£taininjr force of these
advances, however. wa6 steadily taken advan
tage of to realize in the railroad list. Union
â¢Pacific. St. Paul and Atchison were the most
conspicuous objects of the Relling. Southern
Paeiflc at one time broke nwsy from the group
â¢ n<l was marked up to 53%, apparently j n p Ur .
euance cf the design of supporting the market
for realizing purpose*'. The device proved only
moderately successful, an d*d others of the
tame character. In thÂ« late reaction the de
cline ln St. Paul extended to 5%. Union Pacific
to 5%. Atchlson 3T4, Slissourt Pacific 3% and
Southern Pacific to 3%. Much of the selling
frii.ei to be prompted by the renewed fears
of disaster to the corn crop, the same motive
betnr at work ln the corn market. The selling
for Western account was very large and was
attributed to Important interests. The selling
(or London account was another important fac
tor in the day's market. It was rnop t conspicu
ous in the Stee! stocks, but extended besides
to others of the international list.' The week's
movement of money to and from the interior
gives promise of a strong bank statement to
morrow. * Â¦

YORK.. July 19.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Anxiety regarding unfavorable possibilities
In the future rather than any actual present
misfortune depressed securities and caused
cancellation of some orders for merchandise by
Western dealers. Retail distribution of goods
wi 1 not be curtailed by. the labor controversy
unless it Is of long duration, as the men have
saved money during the recent period of full
employment at high wages. Similarly. In tome
osTJcultural. districts where there is fear that
little corn be harvested preceding, bumper
crops at good prices have put farmers in such
prosperous condition that their purchases will
not fall off materially while the greatest crop
of wheat on record â¢ has not brought a return
to the low prices of previous heavy yields.
Beyond advancing prices of steel sheets and
depressing the market for tin, quotations have
not been affected by the strike of the Amal
gamated Association. . PIgiron furnaces are
not disturbed, although record-breaking pro
duction will bring accumulation of stocks if
the rolling mills are kept idle for any length
of time. In the branches not directly con
cerned there is no change of conditions, orders
frequently, running: months ahead. An early
settlement is confidently expected and there
Is much relief over the general collapse 6f
the machinists' strike. In anthracite coal re
gions work has also been Interrupted, but the
recent exceptionally heavy output assures
abundant stocks for some time. ~ / â¢
Woolen mills are generally more active than
at any time this year, orders for heavy
weight goods arriving in large numbers. -The
lightweight season will soon opsn and although
it is expected concessions of from 5 to 10
per cent from last year's prices will be made,
there is prospect of profitable operation unless
the raw material â¢ should advance. Some un
certainty is seen in the wool market, sellers
making futile efforts to secure better terms
and ultimately accepting bids at former fig
ures. The tone ls^distinctly firmer and stocks
at mills and in warehouses decreased. In cot
ton goods the situation is unchanged. Etabll
it- 1 ' of prices seems assured In the footwear
industry. The firm tone is sustained, by the
steadiness of leather and buyers are not seek
ing concessions. Factories are running full
time, with orders on hand for months ahead.
Fall orders arrive ' freely and many New Eng
land producers refuse new contracts unless al
lowed to make deliveries at their own conveni
ence. Limited supplies of leather make the
market, very firm. Hides are fairly active and
steady. Calmer counsel prevailed in the grain
markets, exaggerated dispatches were dis
counted and variations in quotations were less
extensive. After a severe break from the
best price last Friday wheat steadily advanced,
as the feeling became general that foreign re
quirements would bring a new record for ex
ports, possibly exceeding 250,000.000 bushels.
Some of the heavy crop may also be used for
fodder In sections where corn is destroyed.
These Influences fully offset the effect of inte
rior receipts for week of 6,750.242 bushels
against only 4,833,253 .bushels last year. At
lantic exports show a large gain over las^
year's figures for the wwk amounting to $3.
902.775 bushels against 1.841.S61 a year ago.
Failures for the week numbered 193 In the
United States, against 231 last year and 32 In
Canada, against 27 last year.

Claims that Kansas corn was past helD, ex
cept in case where seeding:, had been' unusu
ally late,, and that Iowa corn was hard hit,
came from numerous sources. These claims
were backed up by buying, orders from the ter

corn strength; then developing, together with

NEW YORK, July 19.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: j i ,
Greater activity has prevailed" this week In
the speculative sharÂ« market, although the
public is dclng littlÂ° and bond "transactions,
apart from the large dealings In some of the
manipulated and popular securities of that de
tcription, are still rather restricted. The suc
cessive unfavorable developments of the past
fortnight would appear to . have discouraged
both speculation and Investment, although In
the later connection It may be said that hold
ers of capital have become ' imbued with' the
Idea that prices for securities might' decline
to an extent which would afford opportunities
for ."bargain-hunting." The actual develop
ments ofHbe week, however, have been very
favorable from the point of the professional
Wall street element.
Rains have made their appearance | at the
West, breaking the drought in Kansas and the
Southwestern sections, where great fears for
the crop have prevailed, and although the yield
of corn this year will fall far . short of that
of last year, the estimate which the street has
generally accepted is, that taking . the large
whe^t yield into consideration the cereal pro
duction of the West will furnish abundant
traffic for the' railroads. : Relieved of the most
favorable Interpretation upon the developments
In the railroad and financial world .In connec
tion with the announcement made Â¦ on < Tuesday
evening regarding the future of- the Northern
Pacific Company very heavy covering of shorts
assisted the upward movement of prices : and
the rise was also helped along by vigorous
manipulation from certain large speculative In
terests which appeared to have early informa
tion regarding the pending development. There
was also considerable repurchasing of stocks
by capitalists who had disposed of their hold
ings of the granger and Pacific stocks on the
very unfavfrable crop outlook of a fortnight
ago and the fear that a complete pacification
of the railroad world might not be reached as
speedily as has proved to be the case. -
NEW YORK, July 1Â».â Bradstreet's ; to-mor
row will say: ' â¢ â¢'
Heat, drought and strikes have furnished
their quota of disturbing influences this week,
but despite these a fair volume of business goes
forward and nearly all markets have taken the
developments of the week (all of which, by , the
way, have not been unfavorable) calmly . and
even cheerfully. While only scattered rains are
reported from the worst afflicted sections of the
corn belt and much ; more rain is needed If the
damage Is to be repaired, I the rest of the coun
try reports a' fair amount of moisture Â¦ and the
South Atlantic,, the Central . Western j and the
Northwestern States return more favorable ad
vices than a week ago, ' both as .regards " the
crop outlook and the business doing. - The great
Eteel strike, closely followed - Â»y Â¦ the tie-up of
hard coal miners by a few mine firemen, has
resulted in the greatest suspension of labor re
ported for some years past, but It Is to be borne
In mind that this season is the natural one for
vacations and nothing like, the maximum num
ber of men reported on strike is thought '.to be
out. - Fair estimates place the number of men
actually striking in the steel trade at less than
60,000. and the number of idle coal miners will
not equal this amount. On the other hand the
machinists' strike has shown signs of disinte
gration and is generally conceded to have been
a failure, i- â¢ .-Â¦Â¦:,' .r- ,'Â¦Â¦ \,\- Â¦-Â¦Â¦;,:Â¦Â¦,Â¦ . r Â¦; 1 Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦

"WHEAT â The foreign markets were ' generally
firm, with higher. Liverpool futures.
The opening advance at Chicago was met, by
free selling from the Northwest, causing" a
quick reaction. . Coarse grains were â¢ strong.
The recent : rains are considered insufficient
and cables are. bullish' on Russlan-Danubian
crops. The* "Continent .bought "freely at St.
Louis,"' exporters did likewise at Kansas City
and .Wall street purchased > liberally .In New-
York. The weather in the Northwest contin
ued very. hot. Cables from' the Argentine re
ported that, crop in good . condition, with very
cold and frosty weather. â¢ Shipments from the
Argentine for Â¦ the week were 704.000 i bushels,
against' 1,736,000 for the same week last year

Harrison's circular eaysi "During the week
there have been two coal arrivals from Brit
ish Columbia. 4950 tons: two from Washington.
4937 tons; two from Oregon. 400 tons; two from
Australia. 4227 tons; total. 14,614 tons. The ar
rivals this week foot up not much above half
of our actual' weekly consumption. The short
deliveries have in no way affected tha market
price. Although, we have no- overplus.' still wa
are In close proximity to our sources of supply,
the coast collieries affording us our fuel needs'
beln? within four days" delivery to oaf
market. The quantity of domestic fuel con
sumed at- this season of the year Is extremely
light, and will remain so for fully four months
to come. Freight rates on coal from foreign
sources are declining. Last cable rate* named
from Australia are 12s to 12a 6d, and from
Swansea the last rates are quoted at Us Â«d to
12s. These rates afford Importers an. oppor
tunity to ship coals In moderate Quantities
to this market at covering rates, hence several
cargoes of Swansea and Australian coals havs
found buyers within the past ten days. It Is
pretty well assured that these low rates cannot
long prevail, hence prudence . dictates to con
sumers the advantage or purchasing freely
OH continues to be freely delivered without any
marked change In price. Those who have
changed their machinery adapting themselves
to the use of oil seem to be well pleased with
the substitution, as It shows a monthly sav
ing in their expense account."

MANILA, July 19.â The Roman Catholic
authorities In Manila say they have no
intention of withdrawing the friars from
the Philippine Islands, and reiterate their
belief that the friars will be welcomed by
the masses of the Filipino people as their
spiritual advisers when the people are
thoroughly assured the friars will no
longer exercise temporal authority.
The clericals bitterly charge the leaders
of tho Federal party, themselves Catho
lics, .with inciting the people against the
clergy. They also say they would be will
ing, to substitute American for Spanish
friars, except for difficulties arising from
the Americans' ignorance of Spanish and
the native dialects. The antagonistic re
ceptions given the friars by the people In
the provinces Is retarding the experiment
of reinstating them.

Curtis was also known as Frederick
Curtiss. He was born In England, but
had resided in California many years.
In leaving â¢ you thus suddenly I cannot en
tirely free you from blame. I told you yes
terday I would not come back if unsuccessful
in obtaining employment. Well, I got work
yesterday and was to have started on Mon
day but my reception from you and your son
was not of the kind that would induce me to
continue our past relations. To live again by
myself on a small income I do not care to
do. so will take a long â¢ rest far away from
the sound of the discords that have made life
unbearable. Your son is, in your opinion, a
fine fellow; In mine he is not, and I trust
that now he is all that remains to you here
that he wiii try and be less brutal in his
manner to you and cleaner in his talk, for a
more foul-mouthed blackguard I never heard
than he has shown himself to be in his lan
guage to you. That he ever will make a name
or position for himself I very much doubt.
Certainly he will have to alter considerably
if he does.
And now farewellâa long farewell. We have
had eome happy times together, but of late
Frank and the bottle have caused too much
trouble to- render life bearable. I hope you
will be able to free yourself from both and
find some means of getting a livelihood other
than the one you have done of late years.
Once again, good-by from he who sincerely
loved and admired you.

Mrs. Wilkens: As I am now on the eve
of my departure for the long Journey from
which there is no return ticket, I desire that
you will not burden yourself with any funeral
expenses over my remains. If there is, and
I suppose there will be, an inquest, it is my
desire that my carcass shall be used for what
ever the medical faculty may desire.
Deputy Coroner Quellen, who took
charge of tho case, found a letter in Cur
tis' coat pocket. The envelope was ad
dressed to Mrs. Curtis, but the letter was
headed Mrs. Wilkens. It is as follows:
Friday Morning.
Because of family jars and the drink
ing habit Thomas J. Curtis, an artist, 63
years old, committed suicide this after
noon at his residence, 863 Lydia street,
by taking poison, the nature of which
cannot be disclosed until an autopsy has
been held.
Curtis, his wife and stepson, Frank
Wllkens, had not lived happily together,
according to a long letter the despondent
artist wrote before he took the fatal
draught.
The stepson said Curtis had been drink-
Ing heavily and he believed his stepfath
er's mind was unbalanced.
The family had lived at Piedmont on
a poultry farm which they sold three
weeks ago. They rented the house in
which the suicide was committed. Cur
tis went in the cellar at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon, then returned to a room up
stairs and lay down on a couch, where
he died in a few minutes. Dr. S. H. Ker
gan was summoned, but could render no
assistance.

ALAMEDA, July 19.â Mrs. Ida N. Shaw,
a comely middle-aged woman, committed
suicide this afternoon by swallowing the
contents of a vial of strychnine in the
bathroom of her home at 9 Mastick ter
race. Neither her husband, her mother
nor S. N. Sauber, who lived in the house
in Mastick terrace, can assign any reason
for the deed of self-destruction. Â¦
A few moments before she swallowed
the poison Mrs. Shaw was laughing and
chatting with her mother, Mrs. Mary
Lynch, and Sauber, who had been board
ing with the family for four months. She
had been discussing incidents which took
place last night at a dance she attended
with her husband. She had been attend
ing a business college in San Francisco,
purposing to fit herself so that she might
assist her husband.
The conversation -took place at noon.
When luncheon was over Mrs. Shaw went
into the bathroom. A few minutes later
Mrs. Lynch heard a' noise in the room.
She called to her daughter but received
no answer. Realizing that something un
usual had happened she aroused Sauber,
who was dozing on a lounge. They pried
the door open and found Mrs. Shaw writh
ing in agony on the floor.- She uttered a
few inarticulate words Â¦ in reply to ques
tions from her mother and then lapsed
Into unconsciousness.
Dr. L. W. Stidham was summoned, but
after several hours' hard work the woman
passed away. Upon examining the room
the physician found a vial labeled strych
nine, the contents of which had been
drained to the last drop.
"It is a great mystery to me," said Mrs.
Shaw's mother to-night. "I haven't the
least explanation to give why she took her
life. Any one would think she was the
happiest woman in the world, judging
from the way the acted. Not one word of
complaint ever crossed her lips. She had
no family troubles. \ Her husband treated
her well, and she was willing to work in
order to help him out."
Mrs. Shaw was a native of Canada and
aged 36 years. * She had been married ten
or twelve years. Her husband is about 55
years old and <s employed as a clerk at
Fourth and Townsend streets by the
Southern Pacific Company. The couple
lived In Alaroeda nearly a year. â¢â¢ .

Next Sunday will be the first anniver

an organist. The accompanist of the Pil
grim Congregational choir of East Oakland

Miss Hill was asked with a* few hours'
notice to take her place. The success with
which she accomplished her task encour

OAKLAND. July 19.â The selection
of Miss Mabel Hill as substitute
for Mrs. Harriette Craft as or
ganist of the First Presbyterian
Church during Mrs. Craft's vaca
tion has caused quite a stir in musical
circles. Miss Hill is only 17 years of age
and has studied the organ less than a
year, but she already has remarkable
control of that instrument, and her play
ing gives evidence of unusual ability.
Musical critics who have been attracted
by the young student's work have given
special praise to what they declare as her
phenomenal control of the instrument.
She has what the musicians declare is a
remarkable control of the organ mechan
ism and has the true touch which marks
the master hand in the rendition of the
classical compositions. Miss Hill is de
cidedly -modest in her attitude toward
public display of her remarkable ability,
and has declined many invitations to give
recitals. She consented only at the earn
est solicitation of her parents and friends
to accept .the poet at the First Presbyte
rian Church, a position which is consid
ered in musical circles as most desirable
from a professional point of view.
Last Wednesday Miss Hill had the priv
ilege of playing- on the great Stanford or
gan in Mechanics' Pavilion, San Francis
co, and at the conclusion of her number
Murray M. Hill, builder of th<? organ, was
warm in his praise of her work.
Miss Hill is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert B. Hill of East Oakland and
is a native of this city. After a more ex
tended period of study with Mr. King. Mr.
and Mrs. Hill will take their daughter to
Europe to complete her musical educa
tion. . â¢
work in that line was begun under the
supervision of Will B. King, organist of
the First Congregational Church. That
her progress has been rapid Is shown in
her recent appointment as Mrs. Craft's
temporary successor.

Alvin A. Coffey, freedman by his own
purchase and California pioneer, was
brought in from the Home for Aged Col
ored People this afternoon by Deputy
Sheriffs Striker and Taylor and charged
with insanity on complaint of the other
inmates of the home. *
Coffey is nearly 80 years of age and his
long life has been crowded with interest
ing experiences. His right to wear the
Pioneer's >adge, which he proudly dis
plays as evidence of good standing in the
order, was earned in 1849, when he crosii>ed
the plains with his master, Dr. William
Basset, on the promise that he would le
allowed to buy his freedom. The 'agree
ment was not fulfilled^ and Coffey was
taken back to St. Louis, where he -was
sold. In 1852 Nelson Tyndal, his master,
allowed him. his wife and five children to
go on Coffey's promise to buy himself for
51000 and his wife and children for $500
each, and in 1854 he crossed the plains a
second time.
In 1856 Coffey was ready to- purchase
himself, and sent for the papers. So great
was his master's confidence in him that
the document was made out and forward
ed. Coffey had it inspected by an attor
ney, as he was unable to read, and then
sent his old master the $1000 in gold.
; Armed with his private emancipation
proclamation the ex-slave felt safe to re
turn for his family. He crossed the plains
again with the requisite amount of gold
for the purchase of his loved ones and
brought his wife and children to the
coast, settling in Shasta County, where
he worked in the mines by day and cob
bled shoes at night, receiving $16 a pair
for half-soling the miners' boots.
For fourteen years Coffey has been a
member of the Society of California Pio
neers, and never misses a meeting. He
attended the banquet and voted at the
annual election of officers two weeks ago.
* Two years ago he went : to live at the
Home for Aged Colored People.
Coffey was born, according to his. pa
pers, in 1822. In 1858 he was instrumental
in securing the passage of a- law in this
State authorizing: the creation of a special
school district for children of negro de
scent in any district where there were ten
such children in need of school facilities.
In this - way ho secured an education for
his children in a strongly prejudiced com
munity.- , - â¢ j Â¦Â¦â¢â¢Â¦â¢
Coffey boasts of the, fact that his word
has always been as good as- his bond in
money matters before and since his liber
ation from slavery. His wife died in 1894
and his family is now scattered. One son,
Alvin, is a San Francisco engineer.

"W. H. Mills, land agent of the South
ern. Racine, is booked for decapitation,
apd his resignatlbn will be announced in
a' few days. The Call made the announce^
ment that â¢ Mills was scheduled to go at
the time his authority and duties as press
agent of the company were' taken away
from him and placed in the hands of E.
0. McCormlck. Mills soon after went
Bast to take charge of the Southern Pa
cific exhibit at the Pan-American expo
sition. Nevertheless his resignation- will
come as a great surprise in railroad cir
cles. The official announcement will be
made in a circular, to be Issued by Presi
dent Hays in a few days.
President Hays does not like Mills, and
he is not satisfied with his administration
of the land department .It is said Mills
sought to obtain a statement from Hays
some time ago in regard to the perma
nency of his position, but the president
of the company diplomatically evaded the
cfuesticn. It is thought that Mills may be
allowed to return to Buffalo and con
tinue in charge of trie Southern Pacific
exhibit until the close of the Pan-Amer
ican Exposition, but his retirement from
the land department, of the corporation is
only a question of a few weeks or days.
In this connection it is very probable
that, the land departments of the Union |
Pacific and Southern Pacific will be con-,
solidated, with the ; headquarters at Oma
ha. The force in this city has been ma
terially reduced recently and Chief Clerk
Ford, who. has been in the employ of the
Central and Southern Pacific* for many
years; resigned some months ago to ac
cept another position. . ; " . . . ' Â¦ .
President Hays declined to be seen yes
terday and. Secretary Ingram would
neither deny nor affirm the report that
Mills was to be removed.
W. H. Mills was. formerly in the news
paper business in Sacramento. He was
brought to this city by the late Senator
Stanford and placed In the employ of the
Central Pacific Railroad. When the
break, occurred .between Huntington and
Stanford, Mills cast his fortunes with
Huntington, by whom he was rapidly
promoted to his present position.

Green of the Pacific Coast.
The late City Recorder Edwin Gardner
officiated at twenty-four of the wedding
ceremonies, although possessing absolute
ly no authority to join loving couples ln
the bonds of wedlock. The present City
Recorder. J. J. Murray, who for many
years drove a bus ln San Rafael, has of
ficiated at six weddings and Is prepared
to carry on the matrimonial business at
the same old Btand. Murray bases his au
thority to officiate at marriages on a queer
interpretation of a recent decision of the
Supreme Court of the State and arrogates
to himself the full powers of a police
judge.
' The opinion given yesterday by distin
guished attorneys was that the marriages
solemnized by Gardner and Murray, each
ln his capacity as City Recorder of San
Rafael, are illegal and that thirty couples
are unlawfully living together. The ef
fects of the illegal weddings will be far
reaching unless the couples decide to be
"tied again" by a duly authorized officer
of the law. More than S00 weddings have
taken place in San Rafael since January
1, 1699, couples coming from far and near
to the Pacific Coast Gretna Green.
Recorder Gardner Sets the Pace,
For many years the late Edwin Gard
ner legally married couples ln his capacity
as justice, of the peace. An inspection of
the records of the county discloses the
fact that Gardner did a thriving matri
monial business. When he assumed office
as City Recorder of San Rafael on Jan
uary 4. 1S99, having been defeated In the
election for justice of the peace, he con
tinued to join ln wedlock all couples who
nought his services. In each case Gardner
signed the marriage certificates as "Re
corder of of the City of San Rafael."
Gardner died early this year -and the
Trustees of San Rafael appointed J. J.
Murray as Recorder. Murray assumed of-

Murray's Interpretation of Law.
In other words, the Recorder 'has the
powers of a Justice of the Peace only as
refers to civil and criminal actions and
trials. In the marriage certificates issued
by Murray this month he signed each one
as follows: "J. J. Murray, City Recorder,
Ex-Offlcio Police Judge of the City of San
Rafael." â¢ . Â¦â¢"Â¦â¢Â¦:
- The Recorder shall be the Judge of the Re

perform the duties of a magistrate.
Under the law of 1883, article 6, sections
SOS and 807 provide for the creation of a
"Recorder's Court" In cities incorporated
In the fifth and sixth classes. The article
mentions what civil and criminal cases
may be heard in the Recorder's Court,
and says:
Scope of Recorder's Powers.
The amendment made by the Legisla
ture was to add the words '.'Police Judge"
-to the original section of the code. The
office of Police Judge Is one created by
law and the duties of the office are clear
ly designated.

$7,214,523 assets; consistlng-of $750,000 paid

The reinsurance of the Magdeburg risks
is a part of the recent general movement
of foreign flra insurance companies to
withdraw from the American field. The
competition with domestic companies has
become so keen. and rates have been re
duced to a degree that any unusual losses,
by such catastrophes as the Jacksonville
fire, have cut disastrously into the profits
of the business, and foreign companies
have lately withdrawn from certain parts
of the United States. . particularly the
southeastern. The Magdeburg Company
Is the first to .withdraw from the entire
territory .where competition with Ameri
can companies is met. â¢ . -
Notification From New York. . .
"The Magdeburg Fire Insurance Com
pany of Magdeburg," said Commodore Isi
dor Gutte of Gutte & Frank last night,
"and Its 'pup,' .the Magdeburg Fire Insur
ance Company of New York, are out ot it
entirely. ,We were notified this evening.
The Springfield Fire and Marine Insur
ance Company writes reinsurance on all
the risks of these two companies, and
their Â¦ business ln America will be ter
minated and all branches and agencies
withdrawn. Th6 New York company,
which was formed by the German com
pany to. write Insurance in States where
there la discrimination against foreign
companies, will, of course, be disincor
porated as soon as Its affairs can be
closed."
Many changes In local insurance circles
will result from the withdrawal of the
Magdeburg Company. ThÂ© territory for
which Gutte & â¢ Frank are managers in
cludes California, Oregon, Washington,
New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
Idaho, Montana and Alaska. The com
pany did a large business on the coast,
and this portion of its American territory
gave satisfactory returns, so much so
that those who knew of the negotiations
did not anticipate that It would be in
cluded in the agreement between the
companies. . The- premiums were largely
Increased last year by Gutte & Frank,
and the loss Tatlo incurred was only 42
per cent. ...
Douglass B. /Watson has been the city
agent for the Magdeburg Company and
S. Flgel & Son and T. JD. Ehrhardt the
local solicitors. The. withdrawal of the
Magdeburg- agencies and the direction of
the efforts of their former managers and
agents mto .new channels will mean a
considerable shaking - up â¢ In local insur
ance circles. '- >

the managers of the Pacific Coast depart
ment of the Magdeburg Company, re
ceived advices from the New York office
informing, them, of the consummation of
the negotiations and confirming the ru
mor that the Pacific Coast territory was
included in the deal.
The Magdeburg Fife "Insurance Com
pany of Magdeburg has reinsured all Its
risks in the United States and will with
draw from business la this country. The
Springfield Fire and Marine Insurance
Company has written the reinsurance. â¢

to $781,648, but the first half of this year
brought heavy losses upon the company,
which coupled with constantly decreasing
rates, led to the decision of the company
to withdraw from the United States:
Gutte & Frank became Pacific Coast
r^ aGers f or ,& e Hamburg-Masrdeburg
Company In 1876. and ln 1SS5 for the
Magdeburg Fire Insurance Company
proper. The management of a quarter off
a century's duration - will, of course, be
brought to a termination by the new deal.

As a companion offer to these 25c belts we will sell
