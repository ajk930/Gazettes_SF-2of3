SISSOX, July 7. â A disastrous wreck,
causing one death and injury to several
persons, occurred at Black Butte Summit,
a sidetrack station eight miles north of
this place, at 6 o'clock this morning, when
the Shasta express on the way south
collided with a northbound troop train.
On the latter was a battery of regular sol
diers returning to their Kastern stations
after service in China and the Philippine
Islands. ,
The southbound train had two engines
and was coming up the hill at a good rate
of speed, j hrhe engine in front was almost
completely demolished, as was also the
north-bound engine pulling the train
load of soldiers. The baggage car
and a box car containing the ef
fects of the soldiers were thrown
on top of one of the engines. The baggage
and property of the soldiers was badly
broken. Much of it consisted of valuable
articles gathered in China durinc the re
cent trouble.
The collision was caused by the engi
neer of the northbound train running past
the sidetrack at Black Butte Summit.
When the conductor saw that the train
was being drawn past this track he pulled
the bell rope. The speed was decreased
and when the trains came together the
one containing the soldiers was running
at the rate of about ten miles an hour.
This action of the conductor doubtless
saved a great many lives.
The engineers and firemen of the south
bound train stayed with. their engines un
til just before the collision, when they
jumped and saved themselves from Injury.
Henry Wentz, the engineer of the north
bound train, was badly hurt and was

It has been a notorious fact in Mon
tana for years that thousands of acres of
timber iar.4 have been entered and pat
ents granted to ecip'.cyes of milling com
panies. These things have been known to
not only the general public, but also to
land-owners in the districts where the en
tries are made. In recent years, owing to
the wholesale cutting of timber and the
great extent of the land taken up in this
way, good timber lands have been getting
rapidly scarce.
For three years the Government has
been trying- to get the regular officers of
The Department of Justice in Montana to
prosecute tlie case with vigor. This has
been all in vain and noÂ£ until the appoint
ment of special agents of the department,

does not see how it will be possible to

Death Not Expected.
Dr. E. R. Taylor was seen at his "resi
dence, 2308 California street, last evening,
and in speaking. of the great scientist's
death zaid: i
"Professor Le Conte was one of-the par
ty of the Sierra Club that planned to visit
the Yosemite Valley this year. H,e was
accompanied by his daughter, Mrs. Davis.
I was one of the party and William Keith,
the artist, and his wife were with us. We
went to Wawona.and spent a day in the
grove of Big Trees. The next day we
went into the valley. Professor Le Conte
was in his usual health, and there was
no indication of his approaching death.
In fact, last Friday he planned all the
details for a visit to Glacier Point, that
was to last for three days. I sat with
him last Friday evening in his tent at
Camp Curry. The camp was a"bout a
mile from the Sentinel Hotel. I left him
about 9 that evening, and we arranged to
make an early start on Saturday. About
5:30 Saturday morning I was dressing,
when I received a message from Professor
Le Conte. He asked me to come to him
at onceT" as he was ill. I hurried to his
tent, which was about 100 yards away
from the one I occupied. When I arrived
there I found Dr. Wall ahead of me. The
doctor was my tentmate. Professor Le
Conte was able to 'speak, and Informed Â¦
me that ha had suffered .from pains In
his heart during the night. His daughter,
Mrs. Davis, occupied the other portion of
the divided tent, and he told me that he

When the sun cast his bright rays over
the hills yesterday morning, still was the
journey continued, until at 7:30 a. m. Ray
mond was reached. The twenty minutes
ere the train was due to arrive sufficed
for Â¦ the tired travelers to obtain some
needed refreshment and at 7:50 the casket
with its escort started for Oakland.
Onward, never stopping but to change
horses, the special stage continued its

loss .sustained by science In the death of
Professor Le Conte, Dr. Taylor said:
"The death of Professor Le Conte at
his advanced age is not one to be.regret
ted in. any. great degree from an educa
tional' standpoint. ' It was a. glorious
death, .because it was the passing away
of a great man in harness and in full pos
session of-aU his mentality. He had done
all -he could do s in his life. He had lived
for 78 years and if he had lived a few
years longer he "fcould not have added to
knowledge.- It hasualways seemed to me
to be particularly desired -that one who
has-: done great thing* die suddenly, in full
possession of all. his. mental powers. It
is â¢ sad to ' see those powers ,â¢ waste , away:
To see them go suddenly in full ftfength
seems to me to be befitting. The' loss to
the University of California is the loss
perhaps of its most distinguished teacher,
who had his capabilities retained to the
end. That is a great loss. His name and
work will endure, though he is dead. The
name of Le Conte will constitute the most
precious tradition of the University of
California. Through the influence he ex
erted over .thousands of men and women
at the university his tesffiings will con-
v tlnue for many years. That influence will
also be continued in the- lives of the chil
dren of the students he taught. In the
qualities .found in a man like Professor
Le Conte there is a combination that^has
a dominating power for lasting good."
"Not often does it fall to the lot of any
man to be called upon to make such a
Journey. Within a few feet of us was the
body of my beloved friend and beside me
was his bereaved daughter. 1 .The situation
was such that words fail "me to' describe
my feelings. Mrs. Davis bore the jour
ney with fortitude, considering the grief
she was suffering.". '.â¢__

other wreaths to the casket and when we
arrived at Oakland to-dny after that long
trip not a single t wreath wjaa missing."
"We traveled on an open' stage from 5
p. m. Saturday' evening until 7:30, this
morning, when we arrived at Raymond
and caught the morning' train. Mrs.
Davis and myself sat by the "driver and
the box with the.bd'dy. of Professor Le
Conte was lashed to the seats behind, us.
Foster and Uren, the stage drivers, drove
as they never - drove before! They
seemed, to know every inch of the way,
though at times it was so dark I could
not see' a few feet ahead. Relays of
horses had been supplied: arid we made a
remarkable journey. It. /was remarkable

"The casket was covered with wreaths,
made by visitors in the valley. Many of
them were students, past and present, of
Professor Le Conte and their loving atten
tion was a tribute to a great man.
Cross, Dr. Wall and myself gave Professor
Le Conte some brandy and he revived. He
asked us not to abandon our trip on his
account, but we decided we would not go
to Glacier Point. JlVhe"h Dr. Cross arrived
he took charge of Professor Le Conte,
who seemed to revive considerably. We
consulted togetherâ¢ and decided to makB
a to Vernal Falls, leaving Professor
Le Conte in charge of his daughter and
Dr. Cross. The latter said it was better
for us to go, as Professor Le Conte might
become alarmed if he saw us remaining
there. None had any idea that death was
( so close at hand. While we were at Ver
nal Falls the astounding message reach
ed us that Professor Le Conte was dead.
We at once returned to the camp., I learn
ed there that Professor Le Conte had re
vived after we left for the falls and his
daughter was with him, while Dr. Cross
went to the hotel for some medicines. It
was while Dr. Cross was away that Pro
fessor Le Conte complained to his daugh
ter that the pain in his heart was return
ing and asked to be moved from the posi
tion he was in. In a brief space all was
over. Dr. Cros3 ..was surprised when he
returned and found Professor Le Conte 1
was dead. He embalmed the body and a
pine box was made for it. We decided to
return with the remains as soon as possi
ble. The body was packed around with
leaves to prevent any injury to it during
the trip over the rough mountain roads.

Great interest is already being taken in
the question -of Cuba's first legitimate
Presidency, now that independence is in
eight. So far only three names have been
given serious consideration â General Go
mez, General Bartolomeo Masso and Gen
eral Palma. General Gomez has declared
that he would not accept the office, hin
choice being General Palma, . The latter
was elected tp the head of the Cuban
Government durin? the ten years' war and
has the love of all Cubans.
General Masso has his life long been

HAVANA, July 7.â The Cuban con

regarding the electoral law.
Several meetings were held last
week, but very little interest was mani
fested in the proceedings, many of the
delegates being absent. The Conservatives
are quite hopeless with respect to the re

and they are now endeavoring to secure
a plural vote for property-holders and for
prof eseional and business men. In this
they are strongly opposed by the'Radi-,
cals.
An objection has recently been raised
against drawing up the electoral law until
the United States Government has ap

father "was a full-blooded Spaniard, but
Masso hated Spain with a fiercengss so
uncompromising that he won the rank
vt major general by the incredible bold
ness of his fighting. When peace was re
stored the Massos took. the oath of alle
giance to Spain only to break it shortly
and join Garcia in . his guerrilla move
ments. They were safe in the mountains
of Santiago de-Cuba when the 1 revo
lution came. Masso is a naturalized
American citizen. He secured his papers
while working for Colonel de Figucrado
at Tampa a few years ago. He had little
education, but has ' acquired a Â¦ vast
amount of knowledge through conversa
tion and is a most polished, brave and
worthy man. . He is married to a white
American woman whom he found at Key

was Antonio Maceo.

arbitration before the coming congress of

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentine
has held numerous consultations with the
Minister from Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay and
Paraguay/and these are interpreted by
the Argentine press to mean that these
countries will act together; first, in try

arbitration may be discussed freely, and
second, in remaining away from the con

for the Inspection and branding of live
cattle and products of the dairy intended
for exportation, the purpose being to en
able our exporters of dairy products to
give foreign buyers the assurance of cer
tification by the Government of the United
States for the purity, quality and grade
of our dairy exports. Secretary Wilson
has decided to exercise the authority con
ferred on him by establishing in the cus
toms districts of Boston. New York, Chi
cago and San Francisco a system of in
spection of dairy products, but first will
have experts in those districts gather all
possible data in order that efficient regu
lations may be drafted for the conduct of
this new service. A beginning will be
made in a tentative Â¦way with the purpose
in view to bring about a practical and
honest system by which all parties may
be properly protected. It is stated at the
department to be "probable that at an
early date the owners or shippers of prod
ucts for export may, upon application,
have the same marked and certified as
to purity and quality, provided they are
above a minimum grade, yet to be fixed."

ANACONDA, Mont, July 7.â There Is
now but little hope of the Sheriff's posse
overtaking: the men who held up the
Great Northern Express train at Wagner.
Mont., last Wednesday. The pursuers
have been outwitted and the robbers have
eluded them.
There are two theories presented. One
Is that the outlaws, who are far better
mounted than their pursuers, have al
ready crossed the Missouri River and are
weli on their way toward the Hole-In-ths
Wall country In Wyoming:, the most no
torious refuge of criminals In the United
States. The Hole-in-the-Wall is a fast
ness practically impregnable and capable
of being successfully defended by a few
men against almost any force. The re
gion between the point in the Missouri
breaks and the Hole-in-the-Wall Is very
eparsely settled, a few scattered cattla
ranches being the only evidence of human
habitation. Pursuit over this wild sec T
tion, according to old plainsmen, is vir
tually hopeless.
The other theory is mat the robbers
have gained the intricacies of the .Bad
Lands along the Missouri River, near the
Little Rockies, and are there awaiting
the time when the cha^e shall have grown
cold, when they will seize a favorable op
portunity to ford the river at a place
where crossing could not be effected by
men unfamiliar with the river and its
treacherous windings. Every foot of
ground is an open book to the robbers,
who have used the vicinity as their stamp
ing ground for years.
The officers are still in the field, but
it is the opinion of those who are on the
ground that the scene of active pursuit
must now be transferred to . Yellowstone,
Custer or Dawson County, through one or
more of which the robbers must pass to
reach_ihe Hole-in-the-Wall.

which made the family name famous. He
inherited much of the business ability of
his father and marked success attended
the commercial enterprises which he plan
ned and executed. At the death of his
father he received about $1,000,000 and an
interest jointly with his brothers and sis
ters in the great tobacco house of which
his father had been the head. He at once
purchased from his brothers a control of
the house and by shrewd management
greatly increased his fortune. He built

Mr. Lorillard has for some years prac
tically made England his home, following
the lead of William Waldorf Astor.
Various estimates have been made of
the value of Mr. Lorillard's estate. It is
"believed to be more than $25,000,000. As
long ago as 1884 it was said to- be from
$13,000,000 to $20,000,000.
Temperatures Are Somewhat Lower, but the
Indications Are for flore Warm Weather.

DENOUNCES CORRUPTION
Vigorous Sermon Pre-ched by the
Pastor of tha Sscond Pres
byterian Church.
SAX JOSE, July 7.â The conditionâpo
litical and moralâ of San Jose was the
subject of some stirring remarks by Dr.
H. F. Maclaren of the Second Presby
terian Church this morning, one of the:
largest and most fashionable congrega
tions in the city. He said that 1000 men.
who acquiesced in forms of vice here by
keeping- quiet, could leave the city for
the city's good, and they would not be
missed. His text was. "Be not partakers
cf other men's sins; keep thyself pnre."
San Jose was characterized as a wide
open town, twenty-four hours in the Jay.
seven days in the week, and the whole
year. Citizens prominent in society and
church circles quietly acquiesced in im
moral conditions, he said, and in fear of
vengeance from politicians and bosses
â¢were afraid to raise their voices. This
class had availed itself of the patronage
of the bosses and dared not oppose these
conditions. Officials elected to support
laws winked at their enforcement. He
declared that this state of affairs is keep
ing people from coming to San Jose, and
ho mentioned a company of capitalists
who had intended to :nveÂ«t many thou
sands here, but on investigating condi
tions had gone elsewhere. j_>r. JSLa.au.v-sn
ifc<?n stated that he did not intend to let
things pass *Â»ven if he stood alone. When
be finished Elder Oliver arose and sug
cested a vote of support and confidence
In xh". pafior. and the congregation was
unanimous in favor of his position.

WASHINGTON, July 7.â The proclama
tion of President McKlnley opening to
settlement the lands ceded by Indians in
the Territory of Oklahoma was given to
the public to-day. The proclamation cov
ers the cessions made by the Wichita and
affiliated bands of Indians, in accordance
with the act of March 2, 1895, and those
made by the Comanche, Kiowa and
Apache tripes in pursuance, of the act of
June 3, 1900.
The proclamation provides for the open
ing of the lands In those reservations
which are not reserved at 9 o'clock a. m.,
on the 6th of August next, the lands to
be- open to settlement under the home
stead and townsite laws of the United
States. Beginning on the 10th Inst. and
ending on the 26th, those who wish to
make entry of lands under the homestead
law shall be registered. The registration
will take place at the land offices at Reno
and I^awton. The registration at. each
office will be for both land districts.
The proclamation .provides that:
. . Will Draw for Lands. 'i ,.
No one will bs permitted to make settlement
upon any of the lands in advance of the. open
ing provided for, and during the first sixty days
following said opening no one but registered
applicants will be permitted to make homestead
settlement upon any of said lands, and then
only in pursuance of a homestead entry, duly
allowed by the local land officers, or of a sol
dier's declaratory statement, duly accepted by
such officers. 'Â¦' Â¦- -I â¢ â¢
The order in | which, during the first sixty
days following the opening, tne registered ap
plicants will be permitted to make homestead
entry of the lands opened hereunder, will be
determined by drawings for both the El Reno
and Lawton districts publicly held at the
United- States Land Office at Bl Reno. Okla

'July 29, 1901, Â¦ and continuing for such period
as may be necessary to complete the sale. The
drawings will be held under the supervision
and immediate observance of a committee of
three persons whose integrity is such as to
make . their control of the drawing a guaranty
of its fairness. The members of this commit
tee will be appointed by the Secretary of the
Interior, who will prescribe suitable compensa
tion for their services. Preparatory to these
drawings the registration officers will, at the
time of registering eaoh applicant who shows
himself duly qualified, make out a card, which
must be signed by the applicant, stating tho
land district in which he desires to home
stead entry and giving such a description of
the applicant as will enable the local land offi
cers to thereafter identify him. This card
will be at once sealed in a separate envelope,
which will bear no other distinguishing label
or mark than such as may be necessary to
show that it is to go into the drawing for thÂ«
land district In which the applicant desires to
make entry. These envelopes will be separated
according to land districts and will be care
fully preserved and remain sealed until opened
in the course of the drawing, as herein pro
vided. When the registration is completed all
of these sealed envelopes will be brought to
gether at the place of drawing and turned over
to the committee in charge of the drawing,
who in such manner as in their judgment will
be attended with entire ' fairness and equality
of opportunity shall proceed to draw out and
open the separate envelopes and to give to each
enclosed card a number In the order In which
the envslope containing the same Is drawn.
Manner of Conducting Drawing.
I While the drawings for the two dis
tricts will be separately conducted they
will occur as nearly at the same time as
Is practicable.
Subsequent proceedings are provided for
as follows:
Application for homestead entry of said lands
during the first sixty days following the open
ing can be made only by registered applicants
and -in the order established by the drawing.
At each land office, commencing Tuesday, Au
gust 6, 1901. at 9 o'clock Inclusive, for that
district, must be presented the applications of
those . drawing numbers 1 to 125. inclusive, and
will be considered in their numerical order
during the first day, and the applications of
those drawing numbers 123 to 250, Â¦ inclusive,
must bo presented and will be considered in
their numerical order during the second day.
and so on at that rate until all of said lands
subject 'to entry under the homestead law and
desired thereunder have been entered. Â¦
' Provision *is made for- locating town sites.
Town-site applicants are required to file before
the opening of the lands in a written appli
cation to the effect, describing by legal subdi
visions the lands intended to be affected and
stating fully and under oath .the necessity or
propriety of founding or establishing a town
at that place.
Lands withheld from homestead entry
and settlement will at the time of said
opening, and not before, become open to
the settlement, entry and disposition un
der the general townsite laws of the
United States. None of said ceded lands
will be subject to settlement, entry or
disposition under the general townsite
laws until after the expiration of sixty
days from the time of said opening.
PITTSBURG, July 7.-A. complication
h&s arisen which may have an important
Â«Â£fect upon the action to "be taken at tiie
coming conference between the Amaiga
roated Association of Iron. Steel and Tin
Workers and representatives of the Ste^I
Hoop and Sheet Steel Companies to sÂ»ttle
the wage question. On Saturday twelve
men v.ere discharged from the Wellsvllie
(Ohio) steel plant, an underlying company
of the United Slates Steel Corporation.
Xo reason was given for the oischargss.
but the men say the a.ction was taken be
cause the discharged men were known to
have taken an active part in unionizing
the mill, which has always heretofore
been non-union. The case was brought
before the advisory board of the Amalga
mated Association, which was in session
here yesterday the result being that an
?nr V- n as B Â° ne fortn from President Shat
ter calling upon all union men in the Dill!
to strme to-morrow. Tais action may
seriously cripple the plant, and em#ua-
Mzrs the important fact that President
fciiarrer is determined that the scale must
.>e signed for all mills alike, and will take
r.o chances on a settlement of the exit
ing troubles by the conference to be he'.d
liere this week.
1 ho president of the Amalgamated As
sociation has not ye; been notified cru

of the companies and wiU accept the

ORDERS STRIKE
IN STEEL MILL
CINCINNATI, July 7.â The weather was
perfect, and the Christian Endeavorers
spent a busy. day. The day opened with
three quiet hour meetings of one hour
each, held In three of the largest of the
city's churches, and were conducted by
the Rev. Floyd W. Tompkins of Philadel
phia and the Rev. Wolf kin of Brooklyn.
The meeting at â¢ the Central Christian
Church was to have been conducted by
the Rev. J...W. Chapman of New York,
who is now seriously . ill at his country
home at Winona Lake, Ind. A large con
course of people had assembled therein
in expectation of .hearing him, but the
meeting was de'clared off. . -
The various pulpits about the city were
occupied by. the visiting. ministers, whose
topics were "Twenty Years of Christian
Endeavors.." The 'attendance at these
meetings was large, and especially so at
St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church,
where the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon of
Topeka, Kans., spoke. ' a,
The afternoon was devoted to three sim
ultaneous evangelical meetingS'in the Mu
sic Hall auditorium. These meetings were
classified for men, women and children.
The attendance at all was large and much
evangelistic work was accomplished, espe
cially at the men's meeting in the Audito
rium Endeavor. This meeting was to have
been conducted by the Rev. Chapman of
New York, and in his absence a repre
sentative of the laity, William. Phillips
hall of New York City, conducted^ it.
President Clarke occupied the chair a por
tion of the meeting.
The meeting of the women in the audi
torium was conducted by General Secre
tary John Willis Baer of Boston". The bur
den of the remarks were for temperance.
The attendance at this meeting was the
largest of the three evangelist sessions.
Meeting for Children.
At the Auditorium Ohio the children
held sway, led by the new field secretary,
Clarence E. Beerman of Lancaster, Pa.
Treasurer William Shaw of Boston and
Miss Kate H. Hause of .St. Louis ad
dressed the children, admonishing them
in the ways of righteousness and illus
trating the dangers of cigarettes and bad
reading.
Mrs. Frances E. Clark of Boston, wife
of President Clark, spoke of the Junior
Christian Endeavor.
The German Christian Endeavor Society
held its first meeting in the Philippus
Church, Dr. Clark being the main speaker.
Treasurer Shaw of *Boston presided at
the session at the Central Presbyterian
Church. General O. O. Howard of Bur
lington, Vt., spoke in part as follows: -
Since the incoming of what is called higher
criticism, and during the last two decades of
theoretic evolution taught to our young. men
in, colleges and extended occasionally with
controversy to our theological seminaries, it
has become the fashion to lay stress upon the
earthly life, the naturalistic life of men, women
and children here and now. Even in our best
sermons we miss the Old Testament scriptures.'
Illustrations abound which show more reading
-of other books and less study of the Bible.
It seems to have btecome the custom with our
younger clergymen especially to treat children
and youths as they do plants. Their environ
ment is studied, the development is begun and
continued, and co-relations from babyhood to
the kindergarten, from the kindergarten to the
grammar school, with the industrial thrown
in; from the grammar schpol to the high
school and- from the high school to the col
lege, academic, professional, trade or commer
cial stage.
Truth Wanted and Welcomed,
Great N"eed of Temperance.
I do not object to the criticism of the scrip
ture text and most searching investigation a?
to what holy men of old really wrote when
they -were moved by God's holy spirit, but I
do distrust all fierce triumph which some men
manifest when they show or think they have
shown that Washington was not a good man;
that Shakespeare did not write the books re
puted to him and that Moses was not the com
poser of the Pentateuch. I t object to the par
tisan spirit which undertakes to wrench from
us that which we loved and trusted and be
lieved in and worked with from our spiritual
childhood to our spiritual manhood. Truth we
want. Truth we welcome. So let us have the
whole truth and send forth men and women
into the field as missionaries and endeavorers
to exalt the Savior and who are able to teach
the simple truths which men and women need
and proclaim the good tidings of great joy
continually and without reservation. As we
proclaim the truth In our enlarged possessions;
in all our sparsely settled country, amid the
new and ignorant and superstitious populations,
far away in Hawaii, from shore to shore of
Cuba and among the Porto Ricans and the
eight millions of the Philippines, obeying our
Master's last command to preach and teach
everywhere what he taught his disciples, let
us see to it that we give no uncertain sound;
that we deliver no uncertain tidings, no lame
and weak proclamations. Heertins this method,
the old and well-tried methods,' the successful
method, we shall have abundant fruitage.
The meeting at the Central Christian
Church was conducted by Secretary John
Willis Baer. This was a temperance
meeting and was addressed by Colonel
George W. Bain of Lexington, Ky. ; Rev.
Anna H. Shaw of Philadelphia and Oli
ver W. Stewart of Chicago. Mrs. Stewart
spoke of "Salvation from the Saloon."

RONKONKOMA, L. I., : July >>7.â Ever
since the present season opened the mod
est natives and summer visitors at this
secluded resort have had their sensibili
ties shocked daily by the alleged "goings
on" of the inmates of a health and physi
cal culture retreat In . this vicinity. The
agitation has spread as far as Lake
Grove, and several petitions have been
presented to the proprietor of the health
home, imploring the management .to see
that patients and patrons -wear proper
clothing when going about the streets of
this and near-by villages.
From what can be learned, it appears
that sun baths are one of the features
of the health home treatment, and with
a view to getting out in the atmosphere
as much as possible it is asserted the in
mates chase about the village and the
country side attired in the scantiest kind
of bathing suits. It is against this stalk
ing about the village streets and hall
ways in light and airy costumes that the
opposition of those outside the health
home is directed. They want the practice
stopped.
It is asserted that the zealots attend
ing this health cure wear their bathlngr
suits to the railroad station and to the
postoffice and certain of the horrified
community say they expect next to see
some of the bathing-suit colony attend
ing church in their health clothing 1 . Ho
tel-keepers and cottagers complain that
their patrons are being driven away by
the scandal attending the attire worn by
health retreat devotees.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
A recent British" authority on the subject says:
"Over a hundred years ago Nelson, who was also the.
Mahan of his times, declared the possession of a port
on the. Morocco coast to be a necessity for England
in any European war, and more than once he was'
strongly tempted to take one. Bismarck, soon after
the Franco-Prussian war, singled out the Morocco
question as a certain bone of contention among the
powers; and, speaking in 1.891,, Lord Salisbury pro
phesied that it would be as gr.eat a trouble to Europe
and as great a menace to peace as the other Moham
medan countries farther east used to be twenty years
ago." ; "-.
The country is not rich, but possibly. .it might be
made so under a government that could give security
to industry. At present it is but a land of despotism
and poverty. No power would care to annex it or
who annexed it, were it anywhere else than just where
it is. Its geographical position; however, makes it
desired of all. In France and. Spain a belief prevails
that the British are trying to get some sort of arrange
ment with the Sultan which will give them control of
a harbor arid a fortress opposite Gibraltar. On the
other hand,, the British assert that the French' have
Morocco has risen to importance in the world by
reason of the invention of steamships and long-range
guns. In the old days Great Britain, from/the formid
able fortress of Gibraltar, dominated the entrance to
the- Mediterranean and had a safeguard for all her
commercial and other interests in that sea. No sailing
Â¦yessel could traverse the narrow strait without com
ing under the guns of the fort, while no guns then
known to man could successfully assail the fortifica
tions either of the rock itself or of the port in which
the shipping lay. Very different is the situation now.
Steamships can keep well out of range of Gibraltar,
and disappearing guns intrenched on Spanish soil
could render the naval station untenable. The conse
quence is that the opposite side of the strait is now a
point of great strategic advantage and each nation
believes the other is trying to get it.
SOME time ago a brilliant delegation from
Morocco appeared in London ostensibly for the
purpose of congratulating King Edward upon
his accession to the throne. Europe watched the
event with suspicion, for it is believed in many quar
ters that the British Government has been intriguing
with the Moors for the purpose of gaining a port in
rhcir territory; but while the subject was being dis
cussed it was announced that the Sultan intended to
send delegations to Paris, Berlin and St. Petersburg,
and then the British became suspicious. The delega
tion to Berlin reached that city last Saturday, but for
what object they made their visit no information of
any value has been given to the public. Â¦
MOROCCO AS A PROBLEM.

who seems to have spoken with authority that the
high schools and colleges overtax the strength of the
average student and graduate weaklings. The disr
cussion over the subject is almost as hot as the
weather.
There is good humor and good fun'in the suggestion,
but none the less the skit serves to show how com
pletely the Briton has been- subordinated by the
American. It is not altogether an idle question to
ask if it take an Englishman four days to do a piece
of work how much quiclter will an American, do it.

BY the recent invasion of thejr land by American
millionaires who buy castles and steamship
lines, furnish 'locomotives, and construct under

Morgan, Yerkes, Carnegie and the rest with apprecia

some of them have had a sufficient sense of humor to
laugh. -

A BRITISH JOKE.
Thc situation :n California remains about as before.
Crop condition's show no material change, the grain
and hay yield turning out heavy, while the fruit yield
is realizing the anticipations of those who 'predicted
a diminished production along in the spring. Thus
far the fruit is bringing ; good prices, and hay is
rxtually advancing, something not often experienced
at the very time the new crop is coming in.. The
wholesale merchants continue to express themselves
satisfied with the demand for goods and report money
easy and collections fully up to the average of good
years. Otherwise the local situation exhibits no
features calling for especial mention.
The crop prospects of the country continue brilliant.
The wheat yield, as already mentioned, will probably
be very large, but oats and corn will doubtless run
lighter than expected in som(J sections, the I hot
weather having been against corn in the southwestern
belt. Both corn and cotton are looking better than
along in the spring, the injury done by the cold
weather several months ago having been largely re-
Wall street was practically deserted last week, the
Stock Exchange being closed for three days, and the
extreme lieat cutting down business during the other
three. The market was without especial feature.'
The failures during the first half of the year were
5759. against. 5332 during the same time last year, and
the liabilities were $35,804,000, against $74,747,000. A
favorable feature of this statement was the marked
decrease in bank and brokerage failures as compared
with 1900. this tending to show a more conservative
:.nd better balanced :rionc3 r and speculative market.
The banking insolvencies amounted to $15,839,000,
against $25,822,000 last year. The second quarter of
the year made a better showing than the first, the
average liability per failure being the smallest ever
known, while the failuies in June were the smallest of
any month this year.
The staples maintained the slight improvement
noted the preceding week-/' Boots and shoes continued
active, especially en fell lines, the spot" demand show
ing some falling off. Manufacturers are buying less
leather. 35 the tanners are now stiff holders in- view
of the slow but steady advance in hides. Wool and
woolen goods are in rather better movement, but the
average of prices is slightly lower. The domestic
demand for cotton is better, but the export trade is
diminished by the firrner quotations asked by holders,
which repels shippers to foreign countries. There is
less activity in iron and steel, but this is said to be
due net to any decrease in the consumptive demand,
but to the suspensions on account of strikes, stocktak
ing and the uEu^.l midsummer closing down.'
IX spite of the remarkable hot wave over the major
portion of the United States, the holidays, labor
strikes and midsummer shutdowns and stocktak
ing, all of which operated severely against trade last
week, the country's bank clearings showed a gain of
27.5 per cent over the corresponding week last year.
This is no* a bad showing, though the percentage of
gain was smaller than has been the rule for some
time back. The hot weather was the principal un
favorable factor, and materially checked wholesale
trade and led to the frequent shutting down of mills
during the heat of the day, but it stimulated the retail
demand for summer goods of all descriptions.
BUSINESS STILL GOOD.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
"Whether the Kipling works quoted be
greater than the others, it is possible to
conclude that they might have been the
result, of observation as well as Inspira
tion. ' .
Such a similarity of formation seems to
He far outside the percentage of accident
in unconscious cerebration, particularly
when coupled with the other Instance.
Other points of suggestive similarity oc
cur in the two poems. In "The King's
Jest,"
A murmur of voices, a reek of smoke.
To tell us the trade of the- Khyber woke.
In "Barbara Frietchle," .
A tinge of sadness, a flush of shame.
Into the face of the leader came.
Meter, phonetics and formation are
identical, although the motive is quite
dissimilar.
Consequently, it was rather a shock to
grown up infants who had been elocution
ally trained upon this verse- to read in the
opening of Rudyard Kipling's "Ballad of
the King's Jest" the following lines:
When, sprinetime flushes the desert grass.
Our Kafllas file through the Khyber Pass,
Lean are the camels, but fat the frails,
Light are the nurses, but heavy the bales.:
As the snow-bound trade of the North comes

This verse seems almost too familiar for
any plagiarism. Not even the writing of
a heroic play In which the devoted old
Barbara Frietchle is transformed into a
beautiful young girl could remove the
deeper Impression of the poem.

THE RANGE IN WYOMING.
It is well that Wyoming is the present storm center.
The Congressmen from that State have usually op T
posed leasing the range lands and wanted them ceded
to (lie States., The public men of Wyoming have
earnestly contended that if leasing were adopted the
large and small stockmen and ranchers could never
agree on a division of the range into leaseholds. -But
it seems they are able to agree upon a fair division
when they are going to fence it in violation of the
law. Why can't they agree in obedience to a lease
law as well as in disobedience of a no-fence law? ,
But when that law is enforced the range problem
is not solved, ft;. will never be solved and our meat
supply assured until the stockmen who fight or fence
in violation of the law are made leaseholders of the
range. * . Â¦â¢__.'Â«--*:
In Wyoming, except on the Colorado and Utah
border, all the interests which elsewhere war and
suffer, seem to have agreed on a policy, which is also
caused by the iron law of necessity. The big and little
s-tockmen and the ranchers, be it noticed and remem
bered, have by agreement divided the range on the
public domain among them, have fenced it in and
are dwelling together in lawless peace and harmony.
This c&mfortable condition is about to be destroyed
by enforcement of the law against fencing public land.
The first is a state of war between rivals for ex
clusive possession of the public range upon which all
have equal rights. This is a sanguinary phase of the
situation that every year becomes more appalling.
Stock is slaughtered and left to rot on the plains.
Herdsmen are killed, whipped or driven off and for
bidden to return under penalty of death. The courts
of nearly all the .inter-mountain States have on their
criminal dockets cases originating in this .warfare over
the free range. The small stockman and the rancher
suffer, though they do not participate in the carnage.
The range necessary for the life of their stock is the
battlefield. The combatants are usually from a dis
tance and their country suffers, as do neutral States
on whose soil hostile armies meet and fight.
Th.c Secretary of the Interior has been inquiring
into this fencing proposition and there are indications
that legal war is about to be made upon it, which is
right; for the law should be enforced or repealed. But
from one point of view this violation of the law is
interesting on account of its cause. The livestock
industry is of first importance. to the whole country:
Its zone of most economical production is on the arid
ranges, where' the only use of eighty acres, out of
every ico is stock-grazing. One-fifth of the whole
arid area may be subjected to cultivation finally, but
four-fifths of it must always remain grazing land and
be the reliance of the country for its supply of beef,
mutton, wool and hides. The men" who have invested
money and years in stock find themselves on the point
of inflicting- suicide upon their business. Occupation
of the public rarfge in common destroys it. Much of
it is permanently returned to desert conditions and all
of it is impaired by overstocking. The feed being free
to all, human selfishness induces each to get all he
can. This hard law of necessity operating on the
range has produced two conditions that may be
studied with profit to the country by members of
Congress.
THERE is great dismay among the range stock
"owners' in Wyoming. Dispatches from Chey
enne say that Wyoming has more public domain
illegally fenced for range than any other State in the
West. The large and small stockmen and the'ranch
ers have had a practical understanding by which each
gets his share, and all have fenced it in contrary to the
law. But little attention has been paid to this* prac
tice by the Federal Government since two Territorial
Governors of Wyoming were removed from office for
fencing Government land. That was long ago, and
the belief that public officers should obey the law in
that respect seems not to have become frenzied, so to
speak, in Wyoming. k

The Karfadet, one of four submarine
boats building at Plochefort, was launched
May 17. The vessel's length is 123 feet S
inches; breadth 9 feet 6 inches, and' dis
placement 185 tons. A single screw en
gine worked by electric power is to give
a surface speed cf 12.2.1 knots. Her com
plement is one lieutenant and a crew of
i eight.
The Belleville boilers in the British
cruiser Hermes, are to be taken out am!

France is building nine sea-going torpe
do boats of 161 tons, 4400 horsepower and
a calculated speed of 29 to 30 knots. Tha
boats are 144.2 feet length, 13.2 feet beam
and 10 feet draught. Six are being built
at Havre, two at Bordeaux, and one at
Nantes. Their average cost Is about 5205,
000 complete, against less than $200,000 for
similar boats in the United States navy.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The four hours' full power trial of the
British cruiser Pandora, of 2200 tons, took
place June 5 and did not come up to ex
pectations. The vessel was down to her
designed draught and It was calculated
that with 7000 horsepower the speed would
be 20 knots. The engines developed 7SS0
horsepower, but the speed was only 15.72
knots. The ship is fitted with Reed water
tube boilers, the coal . consumption of
which averaged two and a half pounds.

The new British 7^-inch gun is of ti'ty
calibers, and has a total length of 32 feet
3 inches. Its weight is "15.73 tons, or 2.2".
tons less than the American 8-lnch gun
of forty-five calibers. The weight of
mount and shield is 12.8 tons. It fires a
200-pound shell with a charge of seventy
nine pounds of nitro-cellulose at an initial
velocity of 3000 feet per second, develop
ing 12.4S0 foot tons, against 16.302 foot tons
of the new American 8-inch, that fires a
250-pound shell with a muzzle velocity of

German armor plate manufacturers are
said to have made an offer to supply the
navy with armor at a reduced price of
$4S0 per ton. against $5S0 hitherto charged.
The profits are calculated to have been
from Jo.OOO.OOO to $5,750,000 on 16.000 to 1S.0OO
tons delivered during the last three years.
A Rhenish syndicate recently offered to
delivery In 1903 of armor plate at
$3S7 50 per ton. upon which Krupp and
the Dusseldorp maker reduced its prico
to $480. still giving them a profit of $240

A Russian cruiser is to be built at
Schichau, Germany, which, on- account of
its high speed and other . characteristics,
is being denominated as a destroyer of
torpedo-boat destroyers. Her length is 357
feet 6 inches, and the displacement only
3000 tons. Engines of a collective horse
power of 17.000 are calculated to - give
a speed of 25 knots. The main battery
consists of six 45-pounders, placed Jn a
two-inch Krupp-plated turret forward.
Besides these guns she will carry eight
smaller ones, two Maxims and six torpedo
tubes.
. The French torpedo-boat destroyer
Epee. of 319 tors displacement and 5700
horsepower, built at Havre, has passed
through a six. hours' continuous trial with
success. For five h.ours the average speed
was 29.36 knots, with 272 revolutions, and
during the sixth hour, with 305 revolu
tions, the speed averaged 29.61 knots. The
contract of- 26 knots was thus largely ex
ceeded. French trials are now. more se
vere than in any other navy, as the Brit
ish navy requires only three hours for
vessels of the destroyer and torpedo boat
clashes and in the United States navy a
trial of two hours Is considered sufficient.

The British battleship Formidable, 15,000
tons and 15.000 horsepowerâ begun March
21, V89Sâ is at last near completion. Her
thirty hoars* trial under four-fifths power
took place on June 9. resulting In 11,613
horsepower, giving a speed of 16.81 knots,
with 101.95 average revolutions of the two
engines. All of Its twenty Belleville boil
ers were in use, carrying 257 pounds of
steam, and the coal consumption averaged
1.89 pounds per unit of horsepower. One
important factor in the trial was that thÂ»
ship was about eleven Inches deeper in
the water than the normal, displacement
of 15,000 tans called for, indicating an ex
cess of about 720 tons displacement, and.
the speed under such conditions was very
satisfactory. The full power speed is cal
culated at IS knots.

â¢Brooklyn, s to-day. He says his name is
Frank Russell, but refuses to give a more
definite address than Jersey City.. He was
arrested on Friday at the home of George
Vanderveer, 27 Linden road, where he had
made an appointment with a servant,
Margaret Meyer, to collect 925. She . had
communicated with the police, and Cap
tain Knlppe . was on hand and arrested
him.
â¢ According to the police Russell first
made his appearnce in Flatbush about a
month ago. He represented himself as a
priest and asserted that he was collecting
money for a cathedral nearly completed
In Manhattan. Â¦. ...
Russell remained in Flatbush only a
few days. He returned in about a week,
according to the servant girls, and was
dressed as a nun. -He posed as a Sister
of Charity and 1 , said - he was collecting
money for .the poor. He succeeded in de
ceiving some. of the girls.
His third visit to Platbush was about a
week ago. This I time it, is said, he was
a priest. He pretended to have power to
bring good luck to girls In their love af
fairs. He would guarantee to return to
the girls their suitors, and if. they, did not
have lovers to get them for them. Fur
thermore, It is alleged, he asserted he had
power to put a curse upon any girl "who
did /not give him money. He told Miss
Meyer that if she gave him $100' he would
see that she had a happy life and If she
did not he would put a curse upon her.
The girl told him she did not have the
money just then, but If he would call on
her on Friday she would see what she
could do. He told her that $25 would do
for the first installment and she promised
to have It for him. She consulted her em
ployer and he advised her to see the po
lice. .

NEW TARIFF LAW
NOW COMPLETED
Will Be Sent by Mail to
Governor Taft in the
Philippines.
NEW YORK, July 8.â The new Philip
pine tariff has received â¢ its finishing
touches at the War Department, the
Washington correspondent of the Tribune
reports, and it will be sent- by mail to
Governor Taft in a day or two. It is ex
pected It will be promulgated early next
month, to go Into effect Immediately.
An important provision affecting goods
in transit has been Included, permitting
consignees to declare all imports which
shall arrive In the Philippines widin
sixty days after the tariff is put Into
operation either under the old scheduler
now in use or under the new duties. After
that period the old military customs reve
nue law, founded upon a Spanish law, will
forever cease and the new system, de
signed especially to promote United States
trade, will take its place.
The new law is expected to produce an
nually $15,000,000 revenue for the support
of the insular government, and to reduce
materially imports from all countries ex
cept the United States and Spain, par
ticular attention having been given to. the
Incidental protection of Philippine indus
tries against rivals in the Western Pacific
and Indian oceans. '
The Government at "Washington and the
commission at Manila have been working
over the new tariff since last August, and
now that the full agreement has been
reached it is expected that Congress at
Its next session will' approve the schedules
without modification and put, them into
the statutes. â¢Â¦ /
CHINESE NEGOTIATIONS

Government Will Leave Sufficient
Vessels in Chinese "Waters to
Protect American Interests.
NEW YORK, July 8.â That the admini
stration does not anticipate international
trouble as a result of the Chinese negoti
ations, says a Washington dispatch to the
Herald, is shown by the substantial re
duction in the Asiatic squadron, One bat
tleship, two cruisers and six gunboats
are under orders to return to the United
States, and the cruiser Brooklyn and ad
ditional gunboats will be the next to be
withdrawn. The importance of American
interests in the East will cause the reten
tion of at least one battleship of the Asi
atic station and one armored cruiser.
These and two monitors will make four
armored vessels, sufficient to form the
nucleus of a fleet which can properly pro
tect American interests. Eleven thousand
tons of coal are now en route to Toko
hama, where it will be stored in the coal
depot re-established at that point.

band and desires to remain so. The same
is true of all but a limited number of his
aids, and of these my wife and I are the
only ones in Chicago whose identity is

that the Chinese and the blacks are to

affairs unless the . whites learn lessons
which will afford them protection.
"I am in charge here because this phil

LONDON, July 8.â By far the most In
teresting comments upon the career of
Prince von Hohenlohe, many columns of
which appear in the London morning "pa
pers, are those of the Times, whoso Paris
correspondent makes important revela
tions regarding the dead statesman.
Among many confidential letters and
conversations attributed to him while Im
perial Chancellor is the following sum
mary of his estimate of Emperor Wil
liam: . ... .
-His greatest., falling .is that he does not
think there are any limits to his will. It is
impossible to tell beforehand where he will
be and what he will do. It often happens that
weeks pass without my seeing him. Then he
suddenly 'appears, and I am amazed at his
knowledge of the details of what is going on.
Regarding Emperor William's famous
telegram to Kruger at the time of the
Jameson raid. Prince von Hohenlohe said:
If the Emperor had known that Jameson had
so many sons of respectable English families
with him he would not have sent the telegram.
He thought Jameson had only flllibusters with
him,. and that it was an act of brigandage.
i *On his appointment to the Imperial
Chancellorship he wrote as follows:
- I 'know what a burden I am. taking upon my
old shoulders. I hope for nothing and am re

wife the "bone doctor" departed for Cali

Undoubtedly the most likely harness
horse from California shown at the meet
was the pacer Harry Logan, owned by
Dr. Boucher of San Jose. He seems dos
sessed of all the speed of his dam. Miss
Logan, and is much more evenly temper
ed. He captured his race In rag-time
fashion.

During the meet coast horses and horse
men more than held their own. Stambou
lette had the honor of trotting the fast

son of Stamboul was a top-heavy favor
ite over Toggles and Trilby P to win the
2:10 trot, but "blew up" under the at
mospheric conditions and was never a
contender. Toggles, driven by the Fres
no relnsman, Cnarles Clark,- took the tirst
two heats and was then drawn owing to
lameness.

attendance and an amateur "twister" as
a side-show feature. betting shed, a
light structure, -was blbwn down and over
twenty people suffered from broken bones
and limbs. For a time everything was in,
an uproar, but the bookmakers hastily
dragged their stands* from out the ruins
and â¢ business was resumed as if nothing
had happened. Billy Connors, Veil known

extremely unpopular by his constant
kicking.
Householder brought his prize wagon
tongue and his eye with him and hit like
a demon this series. He is now second in
batting.
Hildy secured a home-run hit at Emery
ville in the morning game. This youth is
playing as good ball as the best man on
the German team:
Captain Reilly is in danger of walking
the streets for ten days and not being per
mitted inside a ball grounds during the

time.
Brockhoff stubbed his toe against a rail
road tie and walked lame during the aft

Charlie Graham's unerring throw to
second in the fourth robbed Bowman of

With the aid of a broom the Germans
tied the score in the fourth. Pabtt singled,
went to third on "Heiney" Krug's two

which struck the plate cleaner and car

Nordyke's throwing from deep right was
a feature of the afternoon trouble.
The Germans lost two â¢ runs by poor
base-running, which was -partly due to
ridiculous coaching by members of the
team.
Householder made a brilliant catch ' in
the morning game.
Hildy's clever throw In from left, doub

order.
Hartwell earned his salary in the last
series. He pitched three innings in the

twenty-one hits off his delivery.
Bowman and Householder robbed the
Germans of many hits by brilliant field

"Youngey" Johnson's sweet voice is

; The British ships Sierra; Estrella and
Monkbarns both sailed for Queenstown
yesterday." Both ' came down from Port
Costa loaded with -wheat last Saturday,
and when Captain Farmer of the Sierra
Estrella met Captain McNeeley of the
Monkbarns ashore he at once offered to
bet a new hat that his vessel would be
first to reach the English coast. Captain
McNeeley at once took the bet, andUhen
covered one or two others that were made
on the side. Both vessels towed to sea to
gether and discharged their pilots at the
same time. When last seen they were
home'ward bound, with j every stitch of
canvas they could carry set and a breeze
piping forty miles an hour behind them. â¢
Besides the grain vessels the barks S. C.
Allen for Honolulu and Levl G. Burgess
for Tacoma also went to sea. For a "time
the Allen - kept " the . Sierra Estrella ) and
Monkbarns company :and when last seen
seemed to have the best of the run. ,

The Curacao took away the following 1
named passengers: Professor Emory
Smith of the University of California, M.
T. Wholey, S. B. Cole, Mexia,, C." C.
Thorns, H. H. Holly, Mrs. T. Fisher and
L. T. Scott. Professor Smith is going to
Magdalena Bay on a scientific expedition
and -will probably come home on the re
turn trip of the steamship. Messrs. Who
ley, Thorns, Holly and Scott are going to
Mazatlan, Mr. Cole to La Paz, Mexia to
Guaymas and Mrs. Fisher to San Jose del
, Cabo.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Curacao sailed 'for Mexican ports yester
day morning. The. harbor police were on
hand and a thorough search of the vessel
was made for Francisco Cassio. alias
Frank Swain, the man who has run away
with his 4-months-old baby. His wife was
there also and told .the officers the man
could go and Â¦ welcome if she could' only
get back her baby. No trace of the man
could be found, and the police are now
satisfied that he is hiding, in -the city.
Departure of the Curacao.
The ship Glory of the Seas sailed for
Coraox, B. C, on Saturday afternoon.
Outside the wind fell light and no head
way could be made. At 10:30 p. m. 'the
pilot-boat Gracie S came out of the fog,
and before she could be put about , had
ranged up alongside the ship. After some
maneuvering the vessels were separated,
and a breeze springing up the Glory of
the Seas was put on her course and the
Gracie S.came In for repairs. The latter
lost her port main topmast backstay and
some of her railing. The damge to the
ship is not known, but it is thought to be
slight.
The schooner J. G. Wall left here for
Eureka last Friday. No progress could
be made owing to a head wind, and at 3
p. m. yesterday Captain Anderson found
himself off Point Reyes. It was blowing
about fifty miles an hour at the time, and
all of a sudden the band of the main sheet
block carried away. In consequence the
jaws of the main boom broke, the main
sail tore away and the port rail went by
the board. The schooner was crippled, and
all the captain could do was to put about
and run foÂ» San Francisco: It will take
several days to repair damages, and then
the J. G. "Wall will sail again for Hum
boldt Bay.
The schooner Glen, bound out, yesterday
afternon was in collision with the Brit
ish ship John Cook. The latter is at an
chor off Meiggs wharf and the schooner
was beating out. Nearing the ship the
captain attempted to go about, but the
schooner missed staya and crashed into
the Cook. The schooner's standing rig
ging caught on the ship's anchor and a
tug had to be sent to separate the two.
The Glen was badly damaged about the
rigging, part of her bulwarks and rail
were carried away and the satis were torn.
The damage to the ship was slight. - It
will be several days before the Glen can
go to sea. Â¦
There were two accidents outside and
one in the bay Saturday night and yes
terday. None of them were very serious
and a few hundred dollars will repair the
damages. . ,.

b- - Â¦ -^ UGENE GEARY'S America won
Â¦Jr. first prize in the 120-dog open
*> stake yesterday at Union Park,
M beating Cbiarinl Bros.' Dewdrop
in the deciding course by a single
point. It was a day of coursing luck for
the winner". He was given a bye in his
first course because of the withdrawal of
Rector. In the third round he beat Mose,
,a 2 to 1 favorite, pointless, and, after get
ting the decision from Castaway, another
bye fell to his lot, Flying Fox, who* was
to have met him, being unable to respond
on account of previous hard work. To'
offset these accidental byes America ran
rings around Wedgewood in the semi
final, though the betting was 4 to 1
against him, and won the longest course
of the day. This made it look a cinch that
Geary's kennel would finish one two, but
Palo Alto, the stake favorite and a 1 to 4
choice for his course, could not fulfill pre
dictions, and lost to Dewdrop. Â¦
After his severe exercise with Wedgre
wood America was ugured" as out of
the running, and as Dewdrop 1 has
been at the bottom, of the card
quite often of late the talent set
the odds at 7 -to 2, with America on
the short e.nd. From the slips, it looked
easy for Dewdrop, but out in the field
America joined in and did his best. When
the flag went up it told that a new stake
winner was added to the list, for Amer
ica in winning had graduated from the
maiden class. Aside from the hard usage
accorded them in the last rounds the tal
ent had a pcod day of it.
Harlean Gladys was a factor until at the
finish of the fifth she lost to the, runner
up, score 5 to 4. For Freedom beat Green
back and lost to Harlean Gladys by a
point. Cold Shivers won two courses, the
second against Valean, a 5 to 3 favorite.;
The sapling stake was won by Rowena,
A. R. Curtis' Fetter Free-Cash young
ster. Lady Newark was the runner-up.

Brandes has conceived the Idea that by
going at once to the convict's cell at Fol

freedom. The prisoner has been making
his efforts in that direction for some
days. As soon as he has settled upon
the work he desires to oe done by some
friends in thi3 city Brandes will go to
Folsom Penitentiary to begin his ten
years as a convict. He has strong belief
that he will be able to secure a parolo,
a belief by no means shared by his jailor*
or â¢ the prosecuting officers of Alamcda
County.
Brandes has started a campaign for re
lease on parole after he has served the
requisite time for an application to be
made to the Prison Directors for his dis
charge. The law requires that any con
vict may make such an application after
one year of imprisonment, no matter whac
the term of sentence is so long as it is not
"life imprisonment."

Slow Promotion.
How slowly promotion in ' the army
often comes is strikingly illustrated by a
list of army veterans sent to his paper by
the Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Ledger. He gives the names
of the seven officers still on the active list
who entered the army prior to the civil
war. They have been in the service ever
since, and yet none has risen beyond the
grade of colonel, and one only attained
that rank prior to the outbreak of the
Spanish war in 1898. Of the seven, six
originally enlisted in the ranks during
the decade preceding the civil war, the
other Colonel Francis L. Guenther. grad
uating from West Point : in 1859. General
Henry B. Freeman, late colonel of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, and General
Theodore Schwan, late assistant adjutant
general, both recently retired, also en
tered" the army in the '50's as enlisted
men. â Providence Journal. ,
With the idea that Metcalf would be un
able to keep the right course long odda
were betted against him. But his inge
â¢r.ulty provided him with an expedient m
the dilemma. The track was a round one
of a mile, and at eacn turn he had a man
stationed with a bell to ring out his ap
proach. This scheme and the superior
speed of his mount pulled him through
and he was heartily cheered on victory.
As a horse dealer he traded to advant
age, and at one-and-twenty he enjoyed
robust health and stood six feet and an
inch. He showed at this period some
pugilistic ability and soundly thrashed a
bully. â¢
At the age of 14 his activity in sport and
the freedom he had enjoyed from accident
caused him to be quite fearless, and he
was getting through life with greater fun
than most ordinary lads. But he had a
severe lesson, owing co a fall into a gravel
pit when a farmer surprised him robbing
a plum tree. But he was not seriously in
jured, and we next find him showing ex
pertness at swimming, and such strength
that he could push his companions below
and swim over them. Such was his fame
in thla direction that, two men being
drowned in the Nldd, Metcalf was en
gaged to seek for their bodies, and diving,
brought one of them from the river deeps.
He began to attend the races at York â
so that the visits of the gentleman indi
cated above to the Knavesmire only serve
to, prove there Is nothing new under the
sun â and other places. It was common
for him to ride among the crowd, and
helped by gentlemen to whom he was
known, he often betted with success. It
was thought a v/ild . thing when he
matched one of his horses to run three
miles on the Forest Moor.
In spite of his infirmity John Metcalf
joined tho other boys in robbing orchards
and depleting henroosts. He learned to
ride and became an excellent viplinlst.
He frequently hunted with the hounds.
That interesting writer, "Kettledrum,"
in the Sporting Chronicle, tells* a marvel

eighteenth century. His name was John
Metcalf, and he was born at Knares
borough in 1718. He was blinded by small
pox at the age of 4.

LONDON, July 7.â Paradoxical as It
may sound, all the conditions of the Lon

week have improved, while actual busi
ness has been worse, if possible, than ever
before. ' Money has been exceedingly plen
ty and prices generally better, but deal
ings, from various causes, have been at
about the lowest ebb. An annoying fea
ture of the week's stagnation is the fact
that large sums of money are actually
yearning for investment, but the public,
from the force of many weeks' habit, re
fuses to do anything but "sit tight."

COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 7.â Although the
Democratic State Convention will not con

leaders and some of the delegates are
here to-day. The delegates will meet by
Congressional districts on Tuesday, when
the members of the committees will be
selected. As no effort will be made to In
dorse McLean, Johnson or any .one else
for Senator, and as the nomination of
Colonel James Kilbourne for Governor Is
assured, no general intere&t is being taken
In the committee on credentials. Much
Interest Is being taken, however, in the
selection of members of the State Central
Committee, of which the McLean men
have had a majority.
The Interests cf Colonel Kllboume and
Mayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland, as
well as of John R. McLean and of others,
are Involved in the new State organiza
tion. Nearly all the leaders of what was
known as "Gold Democrats" are delegates
to this convention, and they are opposing
the platform views of Mayor Johnson of
Cleveland and Mayor Jones of Toledo, as
well as any reference whatever to the sil
ver question- The Hamilton County dele
gation, from McLean's home at Cincin
nati, has selected C. W. Baker as chair
man and Judson Harmon and Harlan
Cleveland as members of the committee,
on resolutions for their respective diB
tricts. Baker was a leader for Palmer
and Buckner. Judge Harmon was Attor
ney General In Grover Cleveland's Cabi
net and Harlan Cleveland was United
States District Attorney under the same
administration.
There has been an active canvass for
months for the gubernatorial nomination,,
with J. L. Zimmerman, J. C. Welty. Isaac

the field against Kllbourne, All have with

answer a charge of breach of the peace,
when he started to run. The policeman
called to him to halt, but he continued
running and the officer shot him down.
Cassidy came here from Cripple Creek
last fall and has a wife living at Colorado
Springs. -
One of the most interesting comments on
the race was made this afternoon by W.
Butler Duncan of, the Constitution, who
summed up the contest by saying that it
seemed practically to settle -the situation
and that the Independence could not here
after be considered a possibility as a cup
defender. Mr. Duncan further remarked
that one of the most gratifying incidents
of the race was the excellent work of the
Constitution's crew in handling sails, and
the manner in which all hands pulled to
gether. He was fully satisfied with, the
showing of the Constitution and the. re-,
suit was a great relief.
Coming back to the Independence, he
said that a yacht that could not show
speed in light weather would be very , un
likely to do better under heavier . condi
tions of winds and sea. :â¢-
The yachts will have their second con
test of the Newport Yacht Racing Asso
ciation's series to-morrow over a thirty-,
mile triangular course of ten miles on a
side it being provided, as usual, that one
leg 'probably. the first, shall be a beat to
windward. It is thought that such a con
test will give the Independence her best
chance of defeating the two Herreshoff
yachts, as' two of the legs must be" made
by broad reaches.- â¢ -- Â¦ ' .
The start, if possible, will be from BrSn
ton's Reef lightship, and it is likely that
almost as large a fleet will accompany the
racers as op Saturday. - , .
It was also pointed out that under the
America's cup conditions yesterday's con
test would have been declared no race,
the usual time limit of five hours and a
half having been exceeded, but those on
the Independence did not make any ex
cuses on that basis..
NEWPORT, R. I., July 7.â It was a day
of satisfaction on board the new yachting,
champion the Constitution,- of resignation
on the Columbia and of contemplation,
but still hopefulness, on the Boston yacht
Independence, so badly defeated in yes
terday's race. . ' â¢
On shore, however/every one discussed
the race from all sides, but principally
with reference to the unexpected showing
of the Independence. It seemed to be the
general opinion among those yachtsmen
who watched the race closely that the
sluggishness of the Crowninshleld boat
was due to some extent to the uncertainty
of the wind some little time after the,
start, and that the true worth of the
yacht was not brought out.
On board the Boston boat not a man
was cast down, the overwhelming defeat
being attributed solely tO' hard-luck. Said
one of those who were on board , during
the race: - â¢ : "i - r \ "
"We know that the Independence can
sail and sail fast, for we have *een her do
it, and we believe "that yesterday 6 ill-luck
attended her from the very start."
Captain Haff is quoted as expressing
similar views to Mr. Lawson, when the
latter came. aboard last night after the
race, and to-night all hands on the Boston
boat are looking forward eagerly and con
fidently to to-morrow's, contest, when,
over a triangular course, the Independ
ence is expected to show her great reach
ing qualities, providing, of course, there*
is any kind of breeze. ?

OAKLAND, July 7.â With -solemn
services, with songs of praise and
word3 of wise counsel, the re
constructed First German Metho
dist Church, on Seventeenth
street, near San Pablo avenue, was to
day rededicated and consecrated to the
worship of God. There were three special
services, morning, afternoon and evening.
The actual dedicatory rites were solem
nized 1 during the afternon by Bishop J. W:
Hamilton. He was assisted by 'the' Rev.
L. E. Schneider, pastor of the church, to
gether with a large choir of male and fe
male voices. At the first service in the
morning the pastor preached upon the
theme "The House of God." At 2:30
o'clock Bishop Hamilton officiated," the
exercises throughout being conducted in
LAWSON STILL
HOPES TO WIN
"It is a strange feeling that comes over

we have looked forward to â when we
come to the land we have read about, and
thought about, and talked about, and
dreamed about. So here, at the threshold
of a new and greater existence as a
church', we have a similar sensation.
"This new church project of ours began
long ago. These lots were purchased for
that purpose In February, 18S9, when this
church, since twice enlarged, stood a
block below on Bancroft way. The pro
posal to have the new church a memorial
to Bishop Kip came in April, 1893. Among
Rev. Dean Lyon of San Francisco, who
was a warm personal friend of the late
Bishop Kip, was to have made the dedi
catory address. He was prevented from
being present, and in his absence Rev.
George E. Swan, the rector, spoke as fol
lows:
Bâ â ERKELEY, July 7.â In a Bimple
service this afternoon, at the lot
where their handsome new place
. of worship will Boon be raised,
members of St. Mark's parish
formally broke ground for the Bishop Kip
Memorial Church. The congregation as
sembled In the old church, and after sing
ing by the vested choir followed the ves
trymen 'and the rector. Rev. George E.
Swan, to the large lot on the corner, of
Ellsworth street and Bancroft way. Here
the ceremony of turning over . the first
spadeful was carried out. F. L. Hobson,
senior warden; A. M. Button, junior war
den, and Mrs. J. T. Baun, president of the
Ladles* Aid Society, participating.
"Not only this,, but It Is to be a worthier
building. We wish it were a temple of
glorious polished marbles, but, alas! the
church is poor. It would be folly to wait
longer. We of this generation have our
work to do and must have room in which
to do it."
"We have long ago outgrown our pres
ent church. There are to-day 425 com
municants, making us one of the largest
country parishes in the diocese. But the
seats in our little church can accommo
date only 300. The new building will have
seats for 600, and will be equipped later
so as to accommodate 1000 if needed.
"Yet our new church is not merely to
be a larger building. That might have
been attained by enlarging again the old
building, as had been many times dis
cussed. But I desire to set free the pres
ent church building for use as a parish
house, where all our parish societies and
the Sunday school may have a place to
meet in.
the original incorporators was the late
Professor Joseph Le Conte. wHo contrib
uted $100 to the undertaking. It is re
markable that notice of the" church's in
tention in this matter was given to Bishop
Nichols only three days before Bishop
Kip's death. In 1895 the old church was
removed to the present location and there
renovated and enlarged. Â¦*
"Meanwhile funds were being collected
for this greater building. The first offer
ing came at Christmas, 1898. Since then
the pledges have been slowly accumulat
ing, and to-day we have $6200. Our church
property, with the exception of the par
sonage, has been mortgaged for $7000. We
are confident that the $15,000 necessary to
finish the building will be raised by the
time it is needed.
During the afternoon service Miss Eber
ling of East Oakland sang a solo.
The rebuilt church was remodeled and
much improved in exterior appearance and
interior finish. The main feature of th*
new structure is a stained-glass window,'
with the emblem of the cross and crown
as the central design. The window is cir
cular, heavily leaded and has been set in
the front wall of the edifice. The other
Improvements have been made with the
view toward modernizing the structure.
The results have been particularly grati
fying: to the pastor and to the congrega
tion, which has made much sacrifice to
secure the changes.
Bishop Hamilton gave his congratula
tions to the church people and the pastor
for their unselfish efforts to make more
beautiful and attractive the house of wor
ship In which they made their devotions
and labored to advance the cause of re
ligion.

TRAP SHOOTING
AT INGLESIDE
P. E. Daniels of this" city is about to
leave for a trip East, during which he
proposes to do some excellent work for
Oakland and the State at large. Mr.
Daniels intends to give a series of lectures
throughout the East upon the resources
of California. Few men are better post
ed upon the State in general. He pro
poses to tell the people of the heat-strick
en East of the commercial as well as the
rural advantages of California, of the in
dustrial development of the State, as* well
as the mineral. He has abundance of fig
ures and has adopted the very effective
method of comparing the California con
ditions with those in the sections he pro
poses to visit. Being originally from the
East, he can do this with great effect.
These lectures will be given in all the
great Eastern centers between Chicago
and New York and will be given entirely
at the expense of Mr. Daniels.
Margaret' A. Farren has transferred to
the Realty Syndicate SO feet on Park ave

His Beneficent Habit
Some realization of the panic "the
American peril" has produced in Europe
Is found in the declaration of a Welsh
rr.ir.e-owner to his startled associates that
the Government of the United States will
"before November" pass a law giving an
export bounty on coal to enable Virginia
operators to possess the French and Alge
rian market. The United States Govern
ment will never pass a. law giving an ex
port bounty on coal or anything else. But
until after the first Monday of December
next there will beâ for the purpose of
making laws of any kindâ no United
States Government. â New York Press.
The American Peril.
The proposal emanating from a woman
suffrage leader that domestic service shall
be put in specified hours of labor shows
how little some women know about do
mestic service. Can the baby be per
suaded to cry at specified hours and be a
little angel at others? Was bread ever
known to bake in exactly the same time
two days in succession? Does the milk
man or the butcher ever fail to come at
the expected moment? Was there ever
wife or mother, gister or daughter who
could measure off her hours of domestic
labor by the clock? The women who
know least about domestic service prac
tically are the most dogmatic in regulat
ing other people's kitchens.â Chicago
Chronicle.
Hard to Manage.
Seats had been provided for 9000 per
sons on the wharf and there were fully
2000 people on the water. Many at
tended the carnival and sham battle in
mask and then marched up to the center
of the city.
At the. close of the display a rocket
fired from Fort Cavite. on the Coronado
j^hore. signaled that an enemy was ap
proaching. Another minute and the long
roll was heard on shore at the fort, bugle
cells were heard on the vessels and the
**Battle of Manila Bay" was on. The
Ranger had been given permission to use
her six-pound rapid-flre guns and the
Pinta, besides having two breech-loading
'guns, had 2700 rounds of blank shells for
her gatling gun. The battle continued fif
teen minutes and ended with the blowing
up of the fort and the destruction of two
of the vessels which assisted in the de
fense.
The climax of the celebration was the
water carnival last night, when the bay
was ablaze with light and the roar of the
guns from the Ranger and the Pinta.
awoke the echoes in the hills. There was
a parade of illuminated barges before the
Queen's throne, which was built on a
barge ninety by sixty fe<jt in dimensions
and lighted by hundreds of incandescent
lights. While the parade was going on
and just as It was dismissed the fireworks
display was made from a barge anchored
in midstream.
The day opened with wild west sports
at Bay View Park, in which the cowboys
from Mesa Grande and Campo vied with
one another in feats of horsemanship.
The afternoon was devoted to quieter
sports, with racing, rowing, swimming
and sailing. The yacht Josephine, owned
by Captain Remert of Chula Vista, car
ried off the honors among the windjam
mers and Llewellyn J. Allen won both of
the single scull events.
SAX DIEGO, July 7.â San Diego's cele
bration of Fourth of July week closed last
night in a blaze of light. In truth the
noise and the light had not ceased, at
midnight and the people were inclined
to obey the mandate of Queen Katherine
and enjoy themselves until morning.

stay pome time. From there he will go to
Constantinople, where he and his wife will
reside. After making a short tour of the
State the Rev. G. E. Atkinson and his

turbulent scenes, such as the Turks know
how to provide for those connected with
the Christian missionary. The Rev. G.
Atkinson was crdajned and took charge of
a church. As lime went by the idea of a
familv reunion occurred to them. The de-
Eire also to hear the tinlt!<? of the festive
wedding bells made itself felt, and as the
thirty-fourth anniversary of the marriage
of their father and mother was approach
ing they iourneyed homeward.
To-day in the prettily decorated parlor
of their home the double wedding was
performed. There were but few guests.
After the ceremony there was a dinner

The day was also the thirty-fourth anni
versary of the wedding of the parents of

Bartlett street was crowded to the doors
with parishioners who appreciated the ef
forts of Pastor J. George Gibson to make
their church a thing of beauty and a fit
place for worship.
The back wall 'of the church, which was
recently repaired, was handsomely decor

GOOD TEMPLATES BEADY
FOR GOLDEN JUBILEE
Much Activity in the Order Prior to
the Coining Anniversary
Celebration.
The semi-centennial anniversary of the
foundation of the order of Good Te'mplars
will be celebrated at the Y. M. C. A. Au
ditorium on Tuesday night. It promises
to be one. of the greatest events in the
history of the order. A programme of
much promise has been prepared. The
hall will be tastefully decorated and a
large number of ushers will attend to the
comfort of the guests. Souvenir pro
grammes will also be presented to those
who attend. Â¦ .\ :
The preparations for this celebration
have awakened new zeal and energy in
the lodges of Good Templars in this dis
trict and many old-time Good Templars
have rejoined the order. One small lodge
in this city has initiated nine members
ranging in age ffom 16 to. 60 years, and
reinstated a former Good- Templar now
past the age of 90 years, who has never
broken his pledge taken in the earlier
years of his life.
Judge Robert- Thompson, a veteran ln
the cause, will be the chairman of the
evening, .

In the beginning the Clams said things as
thus:

It won't scare, and the rhyme is a little
shy: but the Clams are like that. They
start out with fair promise, and then in
the end they fall down. Their ball-playing
won't scare, either, and it is shy in sym
metry. But they landed five tallies in the
first, and the hill people looked glum.
; Kidder Declared to Be Bead.
' Then, In the second, Kidder made a star
run to first, and his dress threw him clear
over the tennis grounds. That was the
star play, but i* was his finish. The Oaks
brought in four runs ' this time, and
"Piggy" Owen knocked the Â¦ ball clean
over a cottage for a home run. He like
wise knocked "NobieV Eaton down out
in right field, "but that was a mere inci
dent. Also, he knocked Apple McKewen
out of the catcher's box, and Dean took
his job. That *vas incidental, too. Duval
Moore broke :i bat in this inning, and
then the Clams came in for their half and
tied the score. It was love all, and the
excitement was at white heat. So was the
pun: so were the white duck suits of the
Clams.
The third inning saw tfce coming of the
"ringer," and the Clams entered a pro
test. ''If Kidder is dead," remarked Dud
Dean, with some justice, "let him get out
of sight. As long as he Is walking around
we insist that he play."
The umpires and the scorer ruled that
Kidder was really dead, and he went and
hid in an oak tree. .
The game went on. and with the aid of
the "ringer," who was an estimable youth
of the name of Warren, the Oaks took the
lead and were never headed. They white
washed the Cl.ams that timeâ the only
time in the gameâ and their score climbed
stead'ly until at the end of the fifth it
was 18 to S for the Tiburon men. That Â¦was
the end. The nines went to beer after
their skittles and the crowd went home.
About 500 society people of San Francisco
and the suburban towns saw the fun.

them and were benevolently neutral. And

Incidentally the score was 18 to 8 in
favor of the Poison Oaks; but nobody
cared about that, not even the scorer.
The scorer, Mr. Farquharson, was as
seemed to be, a kind of change umpire,
and he did not score anything but runs.
He scored most of them, as the figures
show, for the Poison Oaks. Bu,t, as has
been intimated before, nobody cared about

The State Board of Barber Examiners

are now under investigation. Barber Ex

At the Iron Trades Council's headquar
ters it /was reported "that eight rew
unions, embracing over 400 members, were
recently added.
The Electrical "Workers* Union has re
ceived information that the new wage
schedule, requiring an increase of 50 cents
a day, has been granted.
A special meeting of the Cement Work
ers' Union will be held at 915^ Market
street to consider the proposition of pur
chasing additional stock in the Progres
sive Planing Mill.
On April 1 of this year the attack of 1S92 was
renewed by the refusal of certain wholesalers
and jobbers to furnish supplies to any house
displaying a union label or shop card, or in any
way recognizing union labor. - As the Iron
Trades Council has -truly stated this fight by
the wholesalers and jobbers is a fight against
the rise of the union label in any shop or firm,
so that the local product cannot be distin
guished from goods made in sweat shops, pris
ons or ln Chinatown. Should the jobbers and
wholeealers be successful in destroying the la
bor movement of this city, thousands of men
will be compelled to leave and seek employ
ment Â«lsewhere. Houses will be vacant, build
ing activity will cease, real estate deals will
fall through and while a few wholesalers and
jobbers will profit for a time the rest of the
community Â¦will suffer severely.
W. H. GOFF,
President San Francisco Labor Council.
* . . â¢ .Â¦ â¢
Among the Unions.
With the commencement of the present year
the garment manufacturers of this city applied
to the Labor Council for the union label. At
the present time thousands of white operators
are engaged in Vhe making of garments in this
city, and we are told by manufacturers that
there are places open for many more, some
thing unknown heretofore. Speaking gener
ally the industries of San Francisco never were
in such a flourishing condition. This can be
proven by the fact that never in the history of
the city were so many residences, * flats and
business houses occupied and the demand for
more houses was never so great. The city con
tains 50,000 organized wage workers, carrying:
on a constant and aggressive agitation for local
products.
Our merchants must depend upon present re
sources for their future welfare. The volunteer
soldier is a thing ot the past. â¢ His ready coin
will no longer jingle and the laboring man, the
natural producer of the wealth of all nations,
must be considered not as an individual, but as
an entity.
With the discovery of gold in Alaska San
Francisco began to take on a new lease of life.
Hundreds of ships of all descriptions were
fitted out in this port. . Our wholesale mer
chants found a new market for all classes of
goods that had been stored away in ware
houses for many years. The Spanish-American
war and the acquisition of the Hawaiian and
Philippine islands following and the revival of
the agitation by the trades unions for home
made goods has brought every industry to a
flourishing condition. The volunteers attached
to the United States Army have left many thou
sands of unexpected dollars in the coffers of
San Francisco merchants. This condition is
now changed and we must confront ourselves
with the conditions that may arise in the fu
ture. â¢
What the Iron Trades Council has to say
about the stove industry applies likewise to
all other branches of local industries. In 1892
and 1893 a combined attack was made on trades
unions by jobbers, wholesale merchants and
manufacturers. This attemut at destroying
unions was partially successful. â¢
At that time local industries, such as cigar
making, boot and shoe manufacturing, .cooper-,
ing, brewing and many other industries were in
a flourishing condition through .the energetic
agitation then made for home industry and
carried on by thousands of trades unionists,
not only in San Francisco but throughout Cali
fornia. In 1892 over 1400 employes found prof
itable employment. in the snoe factories of this
city. This was reduced three years later to
less than 300. The cigarmakers were decreased
from 700 to less than 150. From 600 tanners pre
viously employed, through the failure of the
shoe manufacturing business, less than 100 now
find steady employment. The Â« tanneries prac
tically went out of existence. The same can be
said about coopering. The output of local
breweries suffered a corresponding, shrinkage.
The local market was flooded with the products
of foreign breweries, because the agitation for
home-made beer had ceased. Thousands of ar
tisans and mechanics were compelled to leave
this city and seek employment elsewhere, while
hundreds of others dropped into the ranks of
the unemployed and were supported by char
ity.
..After a careful consideration of the cir
cumstances surrounding: the present condi
tions of the labor movement in thlc city,
President W. H. Goff of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council issued last night the
following: statement:

: Situation.
AWAITS VERDICT
OF THE PEOPLE
wmen aeiea u?on uancron s case.
Due notice was griven to your society by the
Bloat Monument Association that if you in
dorsed this lying work by accepting the dedi
cation of its author that the stone furnished
fcy your society would be rejected and have
no place in the base of the monument. The
re-election of your present board will most
ocrtainly cause its rejection by your own ac
tion in thus indorsing the dishonorin? of the
noble fame and character of Commodore John
I>rs.ke Sloat. who on July 7. 1S46. fifty-five
years ago. in faithful obedience to his orders,
without any evasion whatever, took posses
sion of California by hoisting the American
fia? at Monterey.
If the society indorses by re-election the
rresent board of directors then no longer com
memorate the 7th of July by the annual elec
tion, but change the constitution, fixing some
oth*r fiate. and let the Native Sons of Cali
fornia and other organizations perpetuate its
plorious hiftory. for the Society of California
Pioneers will eoon tsink into eternal shame and
disgrace and be fit for oblivion.
As to the proposed amendment each member
Â¦will vote as he thinks bf st, but even if it Is
adopted and the regular ticket elected the new
hoard of trustees, we are satisfied, can do no
worse than the present one. while they may
redeem the credit of the society by consigning
this lying work of Bancroft and Willey to the
furnzce where it should promptly be disposed
of. Respectfully, your fallow pioneer,
EDWIN A. SHERMAN.
Veteran of the Mexican War,
Chairman of the Committee of Design and
Construction of the Sloat Monument Asso
ciation.
San Francisco, July 7. 1901.
Â¦ The battle which raged some years ago
In the Society of California Pioneers has
been renewed with vigor since the nomi
nation of a number of candidates for the
offices of the society. The row Is due in
a large extent to the question of Ban
croft's publications, the author of which
was expelled from the society in Febru
ary. 1S94. after a vigorous objection.
The present board of directors, who are
seeking re-election, have indorsed the
works of S. H. Willey. entitled "Califor
nia's Transition Period," and those of the
pioneers who objected to certain state
ments made by Bancroft in his history of
early Calif ornlans claim that the indorse
ment of WIHey is practically a nullifica
tion of the society's action in 1S94.
The following circular has been issued
by the opposition party:
Your unanimous^ vote of expulsion of Hubert
Howe Bancroft as an honorary member of our
society on r<*ruary 5, 1894. lor misrepresenta
tion, perversion of facts, falsification of history
and maligning and defaming our dead pioneer
heroes and brethren of this society has been
nullified ln effect and Btt at naught by the
present board of directors, who seek re-election
and Indorsement at your hands.
They have forestalled the action of the com
mittee which acted in Bancroft's case, to whom
the matter of investigation of the work by S.
H. "VVilley. entitled "California's Transition
Period," was referred, and before that coin
mittee could investigate and report; and they
themselves, after advancing the sum of $300
more or leas to S. H. Willey to get out that
work, ostensibly for his personal aid, now have
assumed the responsibility of its publication
and oCer it for sale by posting up a notice
of the same in the office of the secretary.
The said work quotes from Bancroft's "His
tory of California." which It indorses and
which you by unanimous vote condemned. It
belittles, misrepresents and falsely portrays
the characters of Commodores Sloat and Stock
ton and Captain Fremont, and in the same
line as H. H. Bancroft ln his so-called "His
tory of California." and sets at naught not

croft from this Pioneer Society.

committee to whom the matter was referred

as to the Associated Veterans of the Mexican

this work and at whose respectful request the
subject matter was referred to the committee
