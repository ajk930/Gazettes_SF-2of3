There has been considerable gossip as
to tie reasons which Induced Rear Ad
miral Schley to make the famous loop,
and Captain Cook, commanding the
Brooklyn, explained this morning that it
was Intended tÂ» Bead off the Spanish
fleet. The effect Of the loop was to carry
the Brooklyn farther away from the
Spanish squadron, and then she straight
ened out In a course parallel with the
shore and with the enemy's fleet. The
Viscaya, the ship nearest to the Brook
lyn, was at various times between one
and an eighth and one and three-eighths
miles away from ber pursuer. When the
Vlscaya was left behind the Brooklyn was
five and a half miles distant from the
Colon, and when the latter ship surren

UPPER PORTRAIT IS THAT OF
! GENERAL. FELIX AGNUS.
Captain Lemly would feel hurt to have
it even intimated that he had any. personal
feeling whatever In the Schley-Sampson
matter. In all the time he has been at
the head of the legal department of the
navy, his service dating back to 1S33, he
never has had occasion to pass upon any
question that Involved either Sampson or
Schley ' In any personal aspect.'. . He has
sionally and Is, moreover, regarded as of
a Judicial temperament. In fact, it was
announced early In the day, at the depart
ment, that he had been selected for the
place. But later, on more mature consid
eration, his name was abandoned. It was
recalled that' as commander of the dyna
mite cruiser Vesuvius he had served un
der Sampson off Santiago, and, moreover,
as equipment officer of the Boston Navy
Yard, was now again a subordinate of the
same admiral. In his desire to escape
all criticism on the point of bias, Secre
tary Long felt that there were reasons
sufficient for looking for new material,
and for some man who was absolutely
disassociated from the great controversy
in any phase.
'j Late to-night he decided that he had
found sucji an officer In the person of
Captain Samuel C. Lemly, the Judge ad
vocate, general of the navy, a selection
calculated, because* of the rank of the
office, . to constitute a full recognition of
the dignity and . importance of the forth
coming court "of inquiry. While it cannot
be said that the matter is absolutely set
tled. Secretary Long went so far as to
ask Captain Lemly If he felt free to ac
cept the assignment If it were offered to
him, and it Is believed that Captain Lem
ly will decide to answer affirmatively.
All day Secretary Long was engrossed

court will be open and that the widest
latitude will be permitted in the matter of
witnesses" and that Rear Admiral Schley
will , be, allowed to be represented by
counsel.
The accusation and defense will be
brought out before the court. In the
meantime Secretary Long Is seriously con
sidering the advisability of issuing an or
der prohibiting officers of the navy from
publicly discussing the controversy. The
Secretary is of the opinion that in cour
tesy to the court officers choul* withhold
their statements until they haw had an
opportunity of presenting them to that
toÂ«r.
Rear Admiral' Schley explained in his
official report that the reason why the
Brooklyn was kept so far out was because
be was making a straight line for Cape
Crux. The Otlon. well In 6hore. was fol
lowing the coast line, which trom Santiago
to Cape Cruz describes a curve. Thus
while the Brooklyn was following the
chord of the arc the Colon was steaming
along the curve, and the former, having
the shorter distance to go. would thus
have been able to cut her off in ca.se she
had , failed to surrender. Furthermore,
the 'Brooklyn officers say that as- the
chase began to lengthen the Oregon began
to drop behind, and It would finally have
narrowed down to a duel between their
ship and the Spanish armored cruiser had
not the latter earlier turned her helm and
run ashore. . Â¦ "- â¢'. y. Â¦:. ,

friends after the battle, speaking regret
fully of the distance separating the
Brooklyn from the ships of the enemy.
MAKE-T7P .OF THE BOARD.
Captain Samuel C. Lcmly to Ba the
Judge Advocate. 2* -': ,
Washington, July Â».â The Board of
Rear Admiral Sampson was quoted this
morning as making a severe attack upon
Admiral Schley. The Secretary is anxious
that no further Indiscriminate discussion
shall occur, but that the officers shall wait
until they take the oath.
Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans Is quot
ed this morning as repudiating " an inter
view in which he was quoted as saying
that Rear Admiral Schley was not in pos
session of the signal code. His recently
published book, "A Sailor's Log," however,
bears out his first Interview. In this book,
after telling of his arrival off Cienfuegos
on May 22 and reporting to Commodore
Schley, he says:
"On May 23 I took In 257 tons of coal
from a collier between the hours of 10
a. m. and 6:30 p. m., besides giving coal
to a torpedo-boat. During the night it
was reported to me that there were three
white lights in line on â¢ shore, which I
knew was a signal from the insurgents
that they wished to communicate. I, of
course, took it for granted that the com
modure understood this signal as well as
I did, otherwise I should have Informed
him of its significance. It appeared after
ward that he did not, and thus much val
uable time was lost. On the morning of
the 24th the Marblehead arrived, and the
moment Commander McCalla heard' of
the three lights he went in and communi
cated and in a. few hours Schley knew
that the Spanish fleet was not in Cleru
fuegos." â¢- > .

Young Breckinridge returned to the
city from Del Monte about one week ago.
He had remained at the seaside some
three weeks, but. so far as is known had
met no experience there that would cause
him to think of suicide. He was not and
never had been a lady's man, and was
not known to have had a love affair in
his life, although he was between 22 and
23 years* old. He wall not and never had
been a drinking man. His habits, so, far
as known, were most correct. He
was of *a quiet, retiring disposition, rather
studious in his habits and of the artistic
temperament. He was an accomplished
pianist and a devoted student of music.

Whatever physical ills the young man

his musical studies. The young man once

dropped It because its continuance would
spoil his hands for piano playing.
He did not seem more than usually de
pressed when he came back from Del
Monte. At a little after 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon he was in the kitchen of
his grandmother's home, "joking with the

to-day Mrs. R. T. Fosburg, the
gray-haired mother, went upon
the witness stand and told in
simple words how her daughter w;as
killed. Her ' story was given with fre
quently uncontrolled emotion. Her voice
failed her and she shed tears. Miss Bertha
Sheldon, a guest in the Fosburg home oh
the night of the tragedy, was another im
portant witness. By, her testimony the de
fense wished to show that there were
burglars in the house and that they were
seen by little Beatrice Fosburg. -
There was a long argument between
counsel over the Government's objections
to the admission of this evidence, but the
court finally allowed it to go in because
what was said was spoken in the pres
ence of the defendant.*
Miss. Sheldon was relating the story of
her having been, awakened by a piercing
scream and declared that she opened the
door leading to May Fosburg's room and
cried, "What is the matter?" Robert,
Beatrice and her father and mother were
int the rcom at the time. Witness saw
the body of May upon the floor, and at
that instant Beatrice replied, "Burglars
have entered the house and shot May."
Mrs. B. E. Bullard, now of Madison,
Wis., another witness, declared that on
the fatal night at about midnight she
heard two men talking loudly in front of
her house, and that after. they had been
gone about an hour she heard pistol shots
far off.
Mrs. Nellie Beverly of East Cheshire,
who lived in Pittsfleld. testified that her
husband was sick on the night of August
20, and she claimed that he was disturbed
by Â» the loud breathing of two men who
had stopped running when opposite her
house. She opened the blind and told one
of the men, who was standing by a tree,
to eo away. ' â¢ â¢
Mrs. Fosburg was the last witness for
"As a gentleman I can't appreciate any
maneuver of the Brooklyn in the battle
on the 3d of July in front of Santiago as
an act of cowardice, although the Brook
lyn, went to port when -trie Teresa, with
Admiral Cervera abroad, tried to ram him
and afterward when I, in the Viscaya,
also steered toward him, fell off 22 de
grees further.
"This maneuver, considering the posi
tion of the other American ships which
were attacking the Viscaya by the stern
and quarter, was a proper one."
NEW YORK, July 25.^-The Journal has

In the battle of Santiago, Captain Eulate,
who commanded the ill-fated Viscaya, to
day wrote the following:

Opinion of the Spanish Commander
SAYS SCHLEY DID RIGHT.
Rear Admirals Luce, Ramsay, Jouett,
Gherardl and Walker are some of the
names that have been advanced -for con
sideration.
Mr. Long did not formally notify the
officers who had been chosen to constitute
the court of their selection, and he was
disappointed to learn that Rear Admiral
Kimberly, whom he decided upon as the
third member, would ask to be relieved
from the detail on account of 111 health.
He said that Admiral Dewey, with whom
he has consulted, had expressed the opin
ion that Admiral Kimberly's | health
would permit him to discharge, the duties
which he will be required to 'perform.
Should he decline, the Secretary will select
one of the other retired admirals to take
his place.*
On the other hand. Captain Lemly has
known Sampson officially in the Navy De
partment when the admiral was at the
head of the ordnance bureau, and they
thus were thrown into close contact in
a business point of view for several years.
Captain â¢ Lemly was judge advocate of
the Jeanette court' of Inquiry.
The precept to the court probably will
be issued to-morrow. It promises to be a
rather extended statement of the scope
of the inquiry, compared with such docu
ments in less important cases. Whether
it will direct the court to return an opin
ion or simply to ascertain the facts Sec
cretary Long thus far, declines to say.
The precept will contain the detail of of
ficers, who cannot be said to be officially
appointed until It Is promulgated. Rear
Admiral Schley was not formally notified
to-day by the department of the officers
who will, decide his case, but the precept
will be sent to him and it will constitute
his official notification.
known both men, Schley better than
Sampson perhaps. He. was one of Schley's
personal friends when he (Lemly) was
in active line service. He accompanied
Schley on the famous Greely relief ex
pedition and he rendered valuable services
to him on that occasion, which service
the senior officer recognized.

Greece sent the usual notification of the

IS ACTING ARBITRARILY
"I have just received a telegram from
Adjutant General Reese offering me the
aid of the Stete -militia if I need-It." said
Sheriff Magerstadt after his conference
with the attorneys, "but I will not need
it. If a mob of 200 armed men is patrol
ling the streets, as the officials of the
'company inform me, I will swear In a
number of deputy- sheriffs and will pre
serve order at all hazards. However. I
am not going to call upon the militia."
Out at Melrose Park the armed citizens
remained on wstch until assured that the
negroes were not coming, when they dis
persed.
All day the 300 negroes sat in their cars
in La Grange, twenty-eight miles from
Chicago, in fear. A committee of five citi
zens of Melrose Park called on them dur
ing the morning and used their best en
deavors to induce the men to return to
their homes in Alabama. They informed
the colored men of the actual state of af
fairs in Melrose Park, where 300 armed
men were awaiting the arrival of their
train, determined that they should not be
allowed to allarht in the village. Their
statements alarmed the negroes more
than ever, and finally five of them stepped
off the train and made their way into Chi
cago, where they sought an interview
with Chief of Police O'Neil, asking pro
tection which he could not give, as the
trouble was not within the city limits.
In the meantime attorneys for the steel
company called upon Sheriff Magerstadt
and asked that the company, be 1 given am

which was threatened.
Attempt to Install Them in Strikers*
CHICAGO, July 25.â <Jeneral Manager
Aertsen of the Latrobe Steel and Coupler
Works, at Melrose Park, gave out a state
ment this evening declaring that the com
pany had abandoned the effort to bring
the colored laborers to Melrose Park and
that they will be sent back to their homes
in Alabama.
Places Abandoned.
An itnpcrtant movement upon the part
of the Amalgamated Association is re
ported to be contemplated in Its effort to
win out in the present strike. It was as
serted in this city to-day that all the ar
rangements have been completed for
unionizing the Riverside plant of the Na
tional Tube Company at Benwood, near
Wheeling. This plant is a part of the
United States Steel Corporation and Is a
most important one, emploving as it does
upward of. 2500 hands. Heretofore it has
employed only non-union men, and, al
though there is an organization in the
plant, no movement has ever been made
to antagonize the management.
The men, except the highly skilled
workmen, ere generally foreigners, and It
is said by a prominent labor leader that
the entire force, or a large majority, is
now ready to cast lots with the Amalga
mated Association.
2TEGBOES ABE TTTBNED BACK.
While McKeesport has been quiet up to
th's time, there Is a feeling of repressed
excitement among the men over the pros
pect of extending the strike to the Na
tional Tube WorkF. The strikers as a
rule do not seem to fear that the Wood
plant of the Sheet Steel Company will be
started for some time to come.
Strike Jtay Be Extended.
Information from HcKeesport to-day
leads to the belief that the big mill of the
National Tube Company in that city will
shortly be involved in the strike. This
, was pay day at the works and two promi
nent members of the new Amalgamated
lodge that was organized there last Sat
urday received notice that they were no
: longer required. It was reported that
other member* of the union got or will
yet a similar notice when they draw their
pay. That this will bring on a conflict at
the mill there ta little doubt, for it is a
blow at the very privilege that the Amal
. gamated Association is striving for at the
other mills of the steel trust.
Up to S o'clock no change whatever had
taken place at Wellsville. No new men
were imported and the mills are still at
work. Developments at that point are
being watched closely by both sides.
Equipped for the Battle.
Regarding the methods being pursued
by the Amalgamated Association in fight
ing the steel trust. It was said by offi
cials of the organisation to-day that their
organization was complete; that they
were fully prepared for battle and had
equal facilities for learning the move
ments of the manufacturers, as they had
for studying their own movements. There
was no need of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation hiring spies for this purpose. They
had clever men In their organization, who
were just as capable of learning all that
was desired as paid detectives. The pres
ident denied flatly the published story
that his mysterious mission to Wellsville
'was to get detectives into the mill In the
disguise of non-union men.
President Shaffer of the Amalgamated
Association was In a more hopeful
mood to-day than he has been
for some â¢ time. He declared, that
be was perfectly satisfied with his per
sonal Inspection of the conditions in
Wellsville and expects no difficulty in
keeping his men Jn line at tnat place.
President Shaffer evinced no surprise
Â¦when mention wAt made of the criticism
that had been offered by qther labor lead
ers of his bringing on this battle at this
time. He said that' he expected criticism
from many persons, but that it did not
alter his position nor the conviction he
neld that he was perfectly right. .
During this afternoon Organizer Flynn
of the American Federation of Labor was
a 'aller at the offices of the Amalgamated
Association. He held a. Ions conversation
with President Shaffer and set at rest
all etories to the effect that the Federa
tion was not in sympathy with the Amal
gamated Association by saying the entire
organization was ready and willing to as
sist the Amalgamated Association both
financially and morally in . this strike
whenever this assistance was asked.
Attitude of the Strikers.
York on behalf of the conservative ele
ment in the Amalgamated Association,
has failed. Mr. Garland was unable to
6ecure from the steel manufacturers any
terms on which a settlement could be
reached. They would not recede an inch
from the attitude they have taken, hold
ing that the workers' leaders precipitated
the fight, and peace negotiations are off.
At the same time a more powerful in
fluence Is being sought to carry the olivÂ«
branch to J. P. Morgan. Joseph Bishop.

tion of Ohio, is working as mediator, It

Amalgamated leaders, and carries creden

ceive the association mediator graciously,
and it is expected he will promise to ex
ercise his best endeavors toward a set

"Nothing remains for me but tb main
tain more positively than ever my view
that the decisive thing in tuberculosis is

BERLIN, July 25.â FTofessor Koch's
statement of his discovery regarding tu
berculosis, as made before the congress
now in session in London, has been re
ceived here with some skepticism among
physicians. Before the regular proceed
ings of the Berlin Medical Society began
to-day the members discussed Professor
Koch's address informally, dwelling upon
the fact â¢ that his present conclusion Is
diametrically opposite to his former posi
tion. Several members pointed out that
his new theory was asserted by him with
as much decisiveness as the old. In the
course of the session Professor Virchow
referred to Professor Koch's address In
the following terms:
Berlin Physicians Skeptical.
King Edward received the visiting dele
gates to the Congress on Tuberculosis at
Marlborough House this afternoon. His
Majesty briefly expressed his keen inter
est in the congress and his hopes of fruit
ful results therefrom.
Dr. Ravenel of Philadelphia gave an in
stance of the infection of ten persona
from tuberculous cattle, but said he con
sidered such Instances to be rare.
James King, a veterinary inspector of
London, spoke before the congress, at
tributing the .large increase in the im
ported meat trade to the rigid inspection
of home-killed cattle, and said a meat
salesman assured him that the losses from
condemned carcasses were so great that
the British dealers were forced to buy
Imported meat. Mr. King dissented flatly
from Dr. Koch's belief in the non-trans
mission of bovine tuberculosis to humans,
and urged the adoption of stringent meas
ures In this respect to insure the health
fulness of imported carcasses. He also
urged a Government compensation for
cattle destroyed under its orders, in order
thoroughly to stamp out tuberculosis from
British herds, where, he declared, it was
alarmingly prevalent.
Professor MacFadican discussed the
grrounds on which Dr. Koch based his be
lief, contending- that they were either not
well founded or had little bearing upon
the question, and he submitted arguments
to prove that the strongest grounds re
mained for regarding milk from tubercu-,
lous cows as distinctly dangerous to hu
man being's.
Instances of Infection.
Professor John MacFadican of the Roy
al Veterinary College read a paper on
tuberculosis bacilli in milk as a source of
tuberculosis in man. He said that until
Dr. Koch had declared himself in this
connection to the contrary it was sup
posed to-have been fully proved that hu
man and bovine tuberculosis were identi
cal diseases.
LONDON, July 25.â Presiding at this
afternoon's session of the British Con
gress of Tuberculosis, Earl Spencer,
chancellor of the Victoria University and
a vice president of the congress, severely
criticized Dr. Robert Koch's theory to the
effect that human beings were immune
from contagion from tuberculous cattle.
Earl Spencer said he hoped this was true,
but that he hoped more that the dissemi
nation of such views would not tend to
cause laxity on the part of the dairymen
and cattle owners, or less vigilance by
the authorities charged with protecting
the consumers of milk. The speaker earn
estly trusted the congress would not in
dorse the view that It was unnecessary
to take measures to prevent the trans
mission of tuberculosis from, animals to
humans.

1700,000, The flames started in some big
pile* of . kindling wood belonging to the
Rock Island Fuel Company, on the levee.
A brisk-breeze carried- the - flames directly
across the immense lumber yards of Wey

seething masses- of -flamer'*,The spread i of.
the fire was so rapid that the workmen
:barely had.time_to leave the yard,, some
â¢ losing their coats and dinner paljs.* T.he
.flames pushed their .way into /the adjoin

'middle class homes, of an average valuer
of a few thousand ' dollars - each, from
which the occupants escaped only with
their lives and the clothing -on their

burned, some of them tenements, result- "
ing In a hundred families being rendered,

.by the fire departments of Davenport

The efforts to check the flames were
unavailing until they spread on the north
to the spacious grounds of St. Catherine's
Hall, a boarding school for young ladles,
which was saved after the tower was
burned off. Gradually the battle waged
on the edges of the flaming district told
as the less thickly populated portions of
the city were invaded, and by 10 o'clock
the conflagration was under control. The
mill and yards of the Weyerhauser &
Denkmann Company were totally de-
Btroyed. Loss $400,000. The loss on resi
dences and other property is $300,000 more.

there Is no secrecy that the candidates to

for 1900 the total earnings were $88,339 91,
while this year the earnings were $68,
755 08.
Taylor explained that the falling off in
net earnings was due to the fact that the

Besides the main building there were
also destroyed tfie ice plant, ome 1 cottage
of twenty rooms, the' large laundry and
several small outbuildings.' The valuables
belonging to the guests were in a safe in
the office and were not injured.
Fortunately, the progress of the fire was
retarded sufficiently t^ enable all of the
guests to reach the ground.' Those who
were ill were removed to cottages by.at
tendants. .The personal effects of many
of the hotel patrons furnished fuel for
the flames. The loss Is roughly estimated
to be about $100,000, and is fully covered
by insurance.
The cause of the blaze has not been as
certained, but it is thought that it started
In a defective flue. The first knowledge
that the house was burning came to a
guest who detected. the odor of smoke in
a corridor and heard the fire crackling
between the walls. Instantly , an alarm
was given and guests rushed pellmell
through. the halls and down the stairs to
the several exits. Patients in the sanita
rium which formed a portion of the prin
cipal structure were carried out and were
soon made as comfortable as possible in
distant cottages. There was no lack of
effort to save the : belongings of the
guests', but the blaze, made its ruinous
way with surprising rapidity, and few ar
ticles could be removed- in time, j Employes
of the hotel, assisted by scores of guests;
strove desperately â¢ but futilely to beat
back the destroying flames. The building
was of. light material and in a few hours
was a heap of ashes. * . = ,

July 25, 1901.â Among the arrivals at Camp
Reverie yesterday were Professor Lem
mon and Mrs. Lemmon of Berkeley, who
are loved and honored throughout the en
tire State for their faithful work oa tha
flora of California. They were charmed
with the beauty of the spot and the nov
elty of the plan on which the camp was
founded. "How long have you been
here?" asked Mr. Lemmon of a San Fran
cisco society lady. "Six weeks," was the
reply, "and I have found it an ideÂ«*T*nm
mer. There - is no resort in Califor-"^
nia like it, and I have tried them all. Its
motto is indeed a true one, 'la all Califor
nia no place like this.*"
Close Finish, for Second Place Fur-*

Day.
CHICAGO; July 25.â The Cadillac of De
troit won to-day In the Canada cup trial
races. Milwaukee of Milwaukee was sec*
ond; Detroit of Detroit, third, and Illinois
of Chicago, fourth. The Orion of Mil*
waukee started but did not attempt to fin
ish.
There was nothing in It but the Cadillacs
so far as first place was concerned. She
led nearly all the Tray and after taking
the lead had no competitors, finishing six
minutes and ten seconds ahead at the sec
ond boat. The race of the day, however,
was between the Milwaukee, Detroit ana
Illinois for second place. No finish aa
close as. that of the three boats has ever
been seen in a yacht race sailed near Chi

' Notnlnir less than thirteen full "innings
for the money. The regular Thursday
crowd at Eighth and Harrison streets
feaw baseball yesterday that penetrated
fhe cariac linings and left the pop-eyed
fanatics wondering when It would end.
The sustention of interest was. continuous
Sand when the Dudes picked up their bats
iand went home one run on the short end
ihey'felt that luck was "against them.
Hodson engineered the curves for-Oak
fend and Stricklett did box work for Sac
ramento. During the thirteen pulsating
rpasms both pitchers displayed a
strength, steadiness and coolness that
j^ad an old world tinge to it Stricklett
struck seven Dudes out of the game and
tillowed but nine hits. Hodson was so
Strong that only seven Senators presented
*ree transportation passes to the scorer
tor registration. , And so it was. The
pitchers had it out by themselves and,
backed by splendid support, the best game
of the year ran an honored old age career
before death came. The diamond scrap-
Ing was so full of interest that even such
Â» thrilling incident as the toppling over
Of Babbitt by a cranial shot from Strick
lett's gun was of mild interest to the fans.
More than ten seconds were counted on
the change Dude pitcher, after which he
was replaced by Sloskiman.
â¢ In the fourth inning Courtney crossed
{he rubber for Sacramento. Until the
Eighth not another run was registered,
but then Streib, on a double and a fur
ther move on the bag line by Eagan s
sacrifice, scored on the throw in of Dun
teavy's fly to Doyle. The balance swung
Â£ven, and four extra innings were neces
sary to throw the beam toward the cap
ital.
'Â¦ The culminating stroke camÂ© in this
manner. Hanlon, who had previously
struck out three times, found first base
on an honest hit. The middle station was
purloined and the third stop came on
beveraux's clever sacrifice. Then Mc-
Laughlin uselessly rolled out a two-bag
ger and Hanlon walked home. The Dudes
gave the Senators a bit of a scare in the
last half of this inning, when Moskiman,
after two had been entombed, hit the ball
wer to the left field fence for a two
bagger. Hodson. who followed, flew to
Francks and the game was done. The
score: â .

' NEWPORT. R. I., July 25.-Tb,e Colum
bia to-day. In a rattling thrash to wind
ward from New London to Newport, gave
the Constitution a great beating, the lat
ter finishing a good third of. a mile astern
of her antagonist and being defeated two
minutes and five seconds. The victory
was surprising, for the race was sailed in
weather that as a rule has just suited the
Constitution, the wind ' never exceeding
twelve knots and the sea comparatively
smooth. : â¢ .-.
It was not until Newport was reached
that an explanation of her 'real good
drubbing could be given. The Constitu
tion, following right in the wake of the
Columbia, the leading yacht in the big
sloop, class, struck ttwice in a ledge near
the Race Rock lighthouse. There was a
substantial bump on each occasion, and
after this accident the Constitution be
haved like a lame duck. All her old-time
smartness was lacking. Her speed was
diminished, and she sagged off to leeward.
Mr. Duncan, who is in command, said this
evening ,that he believed some of. the
plates on. the leaden keel were wrenched
off byjthe force of the impact of the hard
rock and that these plates from the finish
acted, as a drag on the yacht and mads
her incapable of showing her usual rac
ing form. -Adiver Was sent down shortly
after the Constitution was moored to
night, but he was unable to make a satis-'
factory examination, and Mr. Duncan de
cided not to race the boat further until
she has been hauled out. and opportunity
given for a thorough investigation.
' The Columbia had the best of the, start
to-day, but had it not been for another
streak "of ill-fortune the Constitution
would have crossed the line first. Two
boats got in her way and she was forced
to gybe to clear- them.
After passing the Race Bock the Consti
tution showed an inability to point or sail
fast, which was very astonishing to those
who have watched her from her launch
down to date. The Columbia, beautifully
handled In the dead "nose-ender" from
Race Rock to the lightship, got the Con
stitution under her lee and kept her there
to the finish line. About fifty tacks were
made between Race Rock and Brenton's
Reef, and many miles of blue water were
wasted in the keeping of the Constitution
blanketed. -

DEPARTURE OP THE PERU.
tion will go from this coast. The
Union Lumber Company of San Francisco
has the contract to supply twenty million
feet of railroad ties and the option on
another twenty million feet as soon as this
contract Is completed; One load of- 65,000
railroad ties has already been delivered
and another load of 60,000 left Noyo yes
terday, j
- When the contract was first entered into
it v-aa the intention of the contractors to
bring the ties tb San Francisco in steam
schooners and transfer the loads to 3000
ton tramp steamers in the bay. William
J. Woodside of Swayne & Hoyt looked
into the matter, however, and decided
that the. big steamers could go to Noyo
and load-- there. The Horda. was accord
ingly sent up the coast and anchored to
a buoy off the lumber company's mill. A
steel' cable was run from the steamship
to the mill and over it ties were sent out
to the vessel In slings until the Horda
was loaded. The big collier Victoria,
which is under charter to Swayne & Hoyt,
received her load in the same manner and
a third vessel will be loaded next month.
It will ta,ke about. 1 two. years to deliver
the forty million feet' of lumber at Guaya
quil, as it is not safe for a steamship to
load at Noyo except "during the months ot
May, June, July and September. At other
times a heavy sea is running-, which
makes it dangerous for shipping. .< .
A wharf 700 feet long is also to be built
at Guayaquil and nearly, all the material
to be used in its construction -will come
from this coast. Swayne & Hoyt, -who are
handling the shipping end of the lumber
deal, also expect to carry a large quan
tity of the wharf material and iare having
a steamer built in the East for that pur
pose. The new boat is to be ready for
delivery by the first of the year and iÂ«s
expected to be fast and commodious.
THE Guayaquil and Quito Kail
road Is to be completed as quickly
as possible and all the ties and
lumber to be used In the construc-

OAKLAND, July 2o.-No San Francisco
freight will be handled by Oakland dray
men to-morrow. The Teamsters' Union
voted to-night, on the assurance of their
officers that the Draymen's Association
would concur in the stand taken, to move
no freight out . of San Francjsco until
Monday. This action will not affect local
traffic, which will be handled as hereto
Â°An exception has also been made with
regard to perishable fruit consigned by
way of San Francisco to Oakland dealers.
The officers of the local Teamsters un
ion expect that the strike will have been
settled by Monday, and therefore advised
the men to take action only for the inter
vening time. Before the meeting to-nlgnt
they held a conference with the employ
ing draymen, who held a meeting for that
purpose, and announced that the latter
would make no attempt to move freight
across the ferries before Monday.
Information was given out at labor
headquarters to-night that unless the
strike was settled by Monday the Dray
men's Association would not move a
wheel after that day until further notice.
The teamsters employed by the Austin
Freight and Transportation Company
have been called out by the San Fran
cisco officers of the Teamsters' Union on
the ground that the company in question
hauls local freight in. San Francisco. ;
The local branch of the Machinists
Union has just received $1000 from the na
tional headquarters as strike aid to the
locked-out men here. ,,â,,/, TT
Officers of the Cooks and Waiters Un
ion visited Charles Relmers, proprietor of
Fischer's restaurant, with regard to the
report that he would attempt to introduce
next Monday the scale of hours and

The action of Getz. Bros. & Co. :ijl-dls
charging five of their men because of
their refusal to do work prohibited by the
Although the teamsters' strike appears
to be in a fair way for a speedy settle
ment, it is universally feared In the busi
ness quarter that the epidemic of strikes
is not yet passed. Trouble is expected to
break out in a few days between Â¦ the
porters, packers and warehouse men and
their bosses. No definite cause has been
given for dissatisfaction, but it is at
tributed to the general feeling of unrest
that exists In all labor circles. For, the
first few days of the present trouble it
was predicted that the porters, packers
and warehouse men would strike in sym
pathy with the teamsters. At a meeting
held Wednesday evening the question 'of
a sympathetic strike was thoroughly dis
cussed, but no definite action was taken. -
Each day sees the fruit merchants in a
better condition to hold out. Fruit was
being hauled in great quantities yester
day from the Jackson-street wharfâ in
fact, it was being hauled in such quanti
ties that one of the leading merchants re
marked that the wharf was cleaner now
than at this time of the fruit season in
any of the last ten years. , ,
Porters and Packers May Striked
The fruit men think that they have been
made a means by which the teamsters
intended to force the merchants to grant
their demands. They argue that the
teamsters thought by bringing a great
pressure to b^ar on the fruit merchants,
who were the easiest parties to injure,
the canneries would be induced to peti
tion the Draymen's Association to grant
the demands. In- this the teamsters ap
pear to have been mistaken. They suc
ceeded in causing a loss of thousands of
dollars to the fruit merchants without
aiding the cause in the least.
Against the teamsters- who deserted
them at this time the fruit and commis
sion merchants do not entertain a very
kindly feeling. Although innocent parties
to the whole trouble, they have been by
far the heaviest losers. In fact, in a
number-of instances their loss will not be
made up during this season. It consists
not only in the fruit that was destroyed
on the wharves but in that which was di
verted to other markets.
"I feel that we shall be completely suc
cessful. Of course, during the trouble
business has not progressed as smoothly
as formerly, but we have managed to get
along. We haVe had the backing and
sympathy of aH our customers to such an
extent that we could not possibly lose.
Not one complaint was made because, of
the delay in making deliveries. We had
too much behind us to lose. Men came
to us from all points for employment.
Had our customers not remained loyal to
us in the exigency the result might have
been reversed."
"A number of our men have volunteered
to return to- their work," said James Mc-
Nab of McNab & Smith. "I did. not ac
cept their offer at the time, but as soon
as a largrer number is ready I will put
them to work. We feel no resentment to
ward the men who quit. There was no
quarrel or dissatisfaction over wages, but
only a disagreement among the men as
to who they should work with.
W. W. Montague & Co. Â¦were also de
lighted when four of. their teamsters vol
untarily returned to work yesterday
morning. The firm entertained no ill-will
toward the men and they were simply
asked if they preferred to take their or
ders from the firm or from the union. On
replying that they were ready to obey
the orders of the firm they were given
their former positions. Only one teams
ter remained obstinate and stated that he
wanted time to think the matter over.
Commission Men Suffer Loss.
W. Wheeler, manager for Â« Holbrook,
Merrill & Stetson, in speaking of the re
turn of the men, said: "Five of our men
of their own accord came in this morn
ing and requested that they be returned to
work. I put the question to them, 'Do you
want to work for us or for the union?'
They replied that they were ready to
work for us and obey our orders. The
firm feels no resentment toward the men.
Some of them have been in our employ
for fifteen years and they admitted that
we always treated them with fairness and
liberality. Only one did not return and
he left with the best of feeling existing
between himself and the firm. We have
asked police protection for the teamsters
and will assist them -in every way."
As soon as Manager Hart learned that
trouble was impending he took immediate
steps to forestall it. Sunday he tele
graphed to the Interior towns and ob
tained the promise of a supply of men. A
number came from San Rafael. Al
though they are ignorant of the streets
of the city they have managed to get
along very well under the direction of the
police. These men will be retained in the
.service after the trouble is terminated.
Yesterday morning W. W. Montague &
Co.'s and Holbrook, Merrill & Stet
son's teamsters of their own voli
tion resigned from the Brotherhood
of Teamsters and returned to their
former positions. In both cases they were
welcomed back and on promise to obey
the mandates of the firm, instead of the
union, were immediately put to- work.
This action, voluntarily taken on the part
of the teamsters, was deemed by the mer
chants as the beginning of the end of the
strike. In fact, it was definitely stated in
many quarters that to-day would witness
the desertion of a very large number of
teamsters from the brotherhood.
' ''On Monday the situation was very dis
couraging, but every day since the aspect
has materially brightened. We pay our
men union .wages and do not require them
to work overtime. When I hire a man I
expect that he will work for whom I may
require. When our teamsters refused to
do express work for the Morton Company
I immediately told them that we would
have tp secure men who would obey our
orders. In my opinion the trouble -has
not greatly Interfered with business in
terests."

policemen in their braid-covered uni
forms. Manager G. E. Hart stated tha
the firm expects to ' have eighteen mor
teams on duty to-day. In speaking of th
strike and its effects on the business ir
terests of the city Mr. Hart said:
W. H. Fuller, treasurer of the Overland
Freight and Transfer Company, while
riding In a buggy behind one of that com
pany's trucks, conveying freight from the
railway depot, had a lively experience at
Fourth and Folsom streets. A striking
teamster attempted to delay the progress
of the team for a minute or two and when
the driver would not obey his behests, the
striker pulled out one of the dray stakes
and started for the man. Fuller pulled
out two large pistols, at the sight of
which the striker dropped the dray stake
and walked away.
Eight more teamsters, making fourteen
in all, have been sworn in as United
States Custom House inspectors to assist
in removing the freight, which the Over
land Freight and Transfer Company is
obliged to remove under its contract with
the United States Government. This
makes fourteen men now employed by
that company who are under the protec
tion of the Federal Government. Mr.
Kuller says they will have from thirty-live
to forty-five men eimilarly obligated and
that they are experiencing no difficulty in
removing the ordinary quantity of freight.
Around the office of Farnsworth &
Rubles, the draymen at 100 California
street, was enacted a scene all day yes
terday that vividly reminded one of the
early days In this State when stages
had to be guarded by a cordon
or rangers. The firm had twenty
nve teams In operation and â¢ each
one was guarded by a couple of mounted
Along the water front everything- was
extremely quiet. The British ship King
Edward was docked at Howard-street
wharf No. 2 and discharged a large load
of cement. It was promptly removed by
Union teams. The Santa Fe Railroad
Company, which has heretofore towed its
freight from Point Richmond on barges
and loaded it on the wharves, sent down
a large consignment of freight to be de
livered on board of the bark Kaiulani.
Instead of going alongside the wharf the
bark remained in the stream and the
freight was taken aboard by the crew.
Quiet on the Water Front
It was reported at headquarters of the
Brotherhood of Teamster?, 672 Fourth
street, that Its pickets had succeeded in
calling off from wagons one driver from
the Commercial Box Factory, two from
Tillmann & Bendel. three from McNab &
Smith, one f-rom the Union Iron Works,
Feven from Wellrr.an, Peck & Co., one
from the Fruit Market and one from
Hooker's Mill. It was claimed that Ale-
Nab & Smith offered $10 per day to ouch
man that could be secured to drive a
team and that Wellman, Peck & Co.'$
men were from the country. It was ro
ported also that the National Ice Com
pany would be compelled to close down
for lack of oil, which the teamsters refuse
to haul. The pickets of the brotherhood
were very active and as each train came
in the men imported by the Draymeu's
Association were brought to the brother
hood headquarters and Induced to join
the Union and assist the striking teatn-
Eters.
A meeting of the conciliatory commit
tee of the Municipal League was held at
Its headquarters, at which President Mc-
Cabe of the Iron Trades Council was pres
ent. Secretary Wisler of the Machinists'
Union did not attend it. The principal
matter discussed outside of the local labor
troubles was the proposition to organize
a State Board of Arbitration, the forma
tion of which is to be %>ased upon tbe
plans obtaining- in Colorado and other
Eastern States. The plan was not very
favorably received.
Considerable difficulty was experienced
yesterday by the Draymerrs Association
in handling- their various Â¦wagons and
trucks. Although afforded ample police
protection, the men were frequently eub>
jected to abuse and annoyance. About 19
o'clock a wagon belonging to McN'ab &
Smith was driven in front of the Califor
nia. Canneries Company's establishment
on Bryant street, between Third and
Fourth. It was heavily laden with apri
cots. The team was in charge of a nonÂ»
union man recently brought from the In
terior. Before the team could reach the
cannery the nuts on the hind wheels were
unscrewed and while the driver was .it
tempting to back in the load was dumped
into the street. Officer Burnette endeavÂ»
ored to drive the crowd back while the
driver and the cannery employes attempt
ed to gather up the scattered boxes and
their contents. Considerable difficulty
was experienced in handling the crowJ,
but Sergeant Wolf and a posse of officers
succeeded In clearing- the street.

Uaj-or Phelan is trying to bring about a, con
ference between the two factions interested In
thus controversy. The Employers' Association
has declined positively, in consonance with its
uniform policy, adopted at the Inception of the
labor 6trugÂ£:les, to have any direct dealing with
the so-called labor leaders. In . the discussions
Mayor Phelan presented many propositions
from the labor unionists, requesting- a. confer
ence and presented the terms of settlement
emanating from the Brotherhood of Teamster*.
In which they expressed a willlngnes* to end
the controversy. These propositions have not
As yet been considered by the Employers' As
sociation and what action may be taken by
that body is as yet undetermined. No confer
ence between the association and the labor
leaders is desired or contemplated.
Later in the day, after consultation with
the executive committee, Attorney
Michaels made this statement:
At the conclusion of the meeting Mayor
Phelan communicated with Attorney
Michael F. Michaels, representing the ex
ecutive committee of the Employers' As
sociation, and by him -was informed that
the position of the association which he
represented was such that, while they
were willing to treat with each individual
employe, under no circumstances would
they consider the dictation of any set of
men banded together as a union.
Secretary Rosenberg made this announce
ment shortly before the close of the meet
ing of the Brotherhood of Teamsters held
last night et the Turk-street Temple. He
was later substantiated by Secretary Mc-
Laughlin of that brotherhood, who stat
ed that while things -were in a chaotic
state at present, all differences might be
promptly brought to a settlement.
Mayor Phelan endeavored yesterday to
become a mediator between the employers
and the employes. He called a meeting
at his office in the City Hail, at whlcn
were present Messrs. Furuseth of the
gailors' Union, Casey and McLaughlin of
tne Teamsters' Union and McKenna,
â¢whom none of the labor leaders seemed
to know. In addition to these, parties
representative of the Produce Exchange
and the Chamber of Commerce were pres
ent. George W. McNear, president of the
Produce Exchange; George A. Newhall,
president of the Chamber of Commerce;
A B. Field of the Field Mercantile Com
pany, W. M. Bunker and Louis Gerstle,
representing as president and directors
the Chamber of Commerce, were in con
sultation with the Mayor for several
hours. _â â¢'
"We are faying to bring about a
conference to avoid a disastrous in
dustrial struggle. Up to the pres
ent we do not know what success we
have achieved- In the interest of the
puccess of this policy we cannot say
any more at present.
The Brotherhood of Teamsters has
made some conciliatory propositions, and
while the representatives of the Employ
ers' Association seem firm, there is a will
ingness on both sides to bring the matter
to an early termination.
Just what lorm the final proposition
may take has yet not been determined
upon. From Secretary Ed Rosenberg of
the Ban Francisco Labor Council, who is
one of the shrewdest directors of the
local labor movement, comes the follow
ing statement:
To-day the Scotts will receive a delega
tion of ironworkers, headed by John Fitz
patrick, the oldest employe of the Union
Iron "Works, and the differences between
the men who went out on May 20 and
their employers will be considered.
AT last a conference has been ar
ranged between the striking ma
chinists and at least one firm of
employers, the largest In the city.

Benjamin Hunter, 50 years of age and
residing at Fifteenth and Howard streets,
was taken to the general emergency
hospital yesterday from the end of Fol
som street to be treated for injuries In
flicted by three men who, he alleges,
were striking ironworkers. Hunter, who
works at the Enterprise Foundry, was on
his way there yesterday at noon when the
men assaulted him and dealt him nu
merous severe blows about the head and
face with a blunt instrument. Both of
Hunter's eyes were closed, his nose. bro
ken and his body badly bruised. He was
not able to identify his assailants, as they
approached him from behind.
STILL AFTER THE COLLEGES.
Shortly after 6:30 the services of the po
lice were required at Fourth and Harri
son streets, where Â»a large body of men
had gathered, hooting and jeering* non
union men and using violence in two in
stances. As the partol wagon approached
most of the strikers disappeared, and the
oilicers found no mob to quell other than
that of women and children.
The non-union employes of the Trans
fer Company, it appears, sought food in
the neighborhood of the stables, but were
refused. As they ventured out of their
quarters, which are guarded by patrol
men, crowds of union sympathizers con
gregated and threatened them. Upon the
arrival of the patrol wag-on four of their
number were placed on board and driven
to a restaurant at 511 Montgomery street,
where they were fed and given food for
their fellow workmen who had been re
fused in the Mission district. .
A mob that surrounded the Overland
Transfer Company's sheds at Fifth and
Bryant streets was in an ugly mood last
night and two calls were received at the
Central Police Station to disperse It.
When Lieutenant of Police Martin and a
squad of officers arrived they were obliged
to use their clubs, but their appeaxance
on the scene prevented any acts of great
violence on the part of the crowd.

All the si eakers last evening dwelt upo~i
the injury to business caused by the pres
ent strikes and advocated legislative steps
to compel arbitration in disputes eetween
employers and employes.

ing to confer with the Mayor will meet
him this afternoon, and if the Mayor
thinks a mass meeting is advisable, he will
be asked to call one by the committee of
one hundred to be appointed to-d^y by
the president of the Federated Club?.
Seeretafy Lorenzo reported that the
conciliatory committee appointed by the
Municipal League had discussed the ques
tion of a citizens' mass meeting durlnc;
the day and that the matter iiad been left
to the committee of the Improvement
Clubs to take action.
A motion also prevailed that the concil
iator}' committee be raised to 100 in num
ber,' tbe president of the Federated Im
pro% r ement Clubs to select the members
of the increased committee.
The question of calling a mass meeting
of citizens was discussed" at length, and
it was decided that a committee of three
be appointed to confer with Mayor Phelan
as to the advisability of such a step.
The committee appointed by the chair
man was as follows: Nathan Bibo,
Charles Alpers and E. A. Lorenzo.
Mass Meeting Is Suggested.
The conciliatory committee appointed
by the president of the Federated Im

All the street car men who went out on
account of their union affiliations have
been reinstated by the Market Street Rail
way Company. They met with Manager
Vining yesterday and for the present no
action will be taken regarding the ulti
matum that has heretofore been sub-'
mitted. It is proposed now to introduce
new demands. .The average time of the
meti employed by the company is fourteen
hours, with a basis of pay approximating
about $2 35 per day. The plan that is
under discussion in the Car . Employes';
Union is to ask for a flat rate of 25 cents
an hour on a basis of ten hours a day. On ;
some â¢ of the roads the rate varies from
19 cents upward, and in order to equalize
the scale of wages a committee has' been
appointed to establish a more uniform
schedule than at present obtains. The re
instatement of the men has averted any
immediate 1 possibility of a strike: The
men say, however, that they were
graciously received by the management
and their demands were listened to with
marked attention. The situation* now, as
far as the Car Employes' Union is con
cerned, has resolved itself into a mattor
of computation, which must be governed
by responsibilities and exigencies of each
of the roads In the city, whether operated
by cable, electricity or horse power. The
men are satisfied to await the action of
the committee before making any demon
stration or showing of strength.

Ten dollars for food for the office cat is
perhaps the most curious allowance ever
made by a Postmaster General, says a
Washington correspondent. An item '. of
this kind was sanctioned to-day by Post
master General Smith. The food is for
the office cat of the postofflce of St. Paul,
Minn. That office is an ancient affair, and 1
is so densely populated with rodents that j
it is -necessary to keep a cat in the, office
for the purpose of decreasing the number
of rats. .
When the requisition from the St. Paul
office reached the department here it
caused some laughter among: the officials,

the requisition was read the matter, seem

granted. > . .â¢â¢';â¢ : ' - Â¦

prophesy unless he knows-
j It is questionable what is to be the effect of these
new. issues.: There are some optimists who look upon
them as the natural, outcome of > prosperity, while
others believe them to constitute an overproduction
of. securities which is sooner or later to have a bad
effect upon finance and industry. Warnings in plenty
have been given by the. alarmists, but of course the
hopeful pay no attention to them. Prudent people,
however, will be wary of investing, too much in -a
market that -is so suddenly swollen \ by the multipli
cation of securities. There seems to be something
like a craze in the business which will have to run 1
if s course, but "as to what the end will be let no man
When to that report there is added the further in
formation that the speculative boom in enterprises of
various kinds has led to the issue of a large amount
of stocks and bonds not listed on the exchange, it
will be seen that the opportunities for the investment
of money are ample enough to suit all tastes and air
conditions of wealth.
According to a recent statement of the Financial
Chronicle there were listed on the New York Stock
Exchange during the first six months of this year
new issues of bonds to the amount of $161,678,500,
which just about equals the amount listed altogether
during the first half of the four .preceding years.
Bonds issued to replace old securities (in. many cases
stocks) aggregated $226,978,400 additional in the half
year. At the. same time the listings of stock, includ
ing new issues and to take up old issues, aggregated
$1,273,587,575â a volume never before even partially
approached.
REPORTS from New York show considerable
anxiety among financial experts concerning
the probable effect upon the welfare of the
country of the extraordinary increase in the number
of securities of all sorts and values that have been
placed upon the market. It appears that these at
tractions for investors have become almost numerous
enough to afford Wall street securities and stocks
to throw at the birds if the brokers should care to
amuse themselves in that way while the weather is
too hot to make it pleasant to burn anything.
SECURITIES MULTIPLYING.
There is an earnest clamor in the East for the Gov
ernment to devise some kind of a postage stamp that
will not get clammy and stick to anything it touches
during the humid spells.
Admitting that. the exhibitions so far given have
not been so bad as those of Mexico, or of Spain," it can
nevertheless be safely said that if they continue 'it will
not be very long before a demand will be made for
the "real thing." In fact,; one of the promoters of
the exhibition is reported; to -have said: "We. have
A reporter describing the scene, when a 1 toreador
was struck by a bull and knocked over says : "Spec
tators stood on seats and roared shouts of excited
comment, shrieking in a hysteria of diabolical delight
at the plight of the toreador, hurling improvised darts
of pin-stuck sticks at the animal's sides, sending a
shower of seat cushions into the arena, shouting jo
cosely as the maddened, foam-streaked animal turned
first to the toreador, who had fallen under his hoofs
and lay panting, struggling, yelling, then sought to
hook his horns into the flying cushions. The interest
ing features of agility of the toreadors and the usually
comical evolutions of the bulls in turning against their
tormentors were considered tame by the spectators,
who desired something of even more dangerous char
acter than was- being exhibited for them. They
â¢wanted either a bull's life or a toreador's life to get
their money's worth." ' . . V
animal. In one of the exhibitions a matador slipped
before the bull, and ere he could rise or assistance be
given the bull gored him and tossed him up in the
air, breaking two of his ribs. â¢ Several other casual
tics almost as bad occurred at other exhibitions, and
it is seemingly an expectation of witnessing some
thing of the kind that has drawn the spectators to
crowd the a-ena.
The assertions of the Omaha people are in a meas
ure correct. It appears that no bull has been killed
in the ring, and no attempt has been made to kill one,
but none the less the one element of attraction pos
sessed by the sport is .that of danger. The bulls are
prodded, tormented and lanced until they become en
raged, and then the game consists in seeing whether
the toreadors can escape the horns of the maddened
THE BULLFIGHTS AT OMAHA.
BUFFALO'S exposition, with all its industrial
exhibits and Midway attractions, has hardly
caused so much talk in the East this summer
as the series of bullfights at Omaha. It is only fair
to Omaha to say at once that the people there do not
refer to the shows as bull "fights." They assert that
no horses are used, that the bulls are not killed, and
that the contests between the various performers and
the bulls bear no more relation to a Spanish bullfight
than does a well ordered "sparring match to a prize
fight.
Professor Starr of the University of Chicago is
quoted as having said recently that if the American
people "exclude all foreign immigrants it will take
only a few years for the Indian to haunt his old-time
pastures again." Surely President Harper will even
tually get on to those professors of his and shoot a
star or two by way of a lesson to the rest.
NICARAGUA CANALâ D. C. M., Fres
no, Cal. As early as 1550 Antonio Galvao
broached the subject of a canal from the
Atlantic to the Pacific to include Lake
Nicaragua. In June, 1826, tho Central
American Government gavo A, H. Pal
mer of New York a franchise to construct
a canal through the republic of Nicara
gua for vessels of the largest burden. In
1S42 Louis Napoleon, who afterward be
came Emperor, proposed to build a ship
canal across Nicaragua. The Govern
ment of Nicaragua proposed to do the
same thing in 1846, Colonel O. W, Childs
made a survey in 1S51 for an American
company that was to have a charter for
eighty-five years, but the capitalists who

The issue is made up. The appeal goes to stanch
and true Republicans to unite to save San Francisco
politics from the evil that threatens. The only sure
way to defeat boss domination is for Republicans to
organize for good government.
There is one thing certain â the people of San Fran
cisco will not elect a ticket nominated by boss dicta
tion if there be any other kind of ticket presented to
them. It is, moreover, well known that there !s more
independence of spirit among Republicans than
among Democrats, and therefore the chance of a boss
ticket bearing the Republican party name will be less
than that of one bearing the Democratic name. If,
then, Republicans surrender their party to the bosses
they will virtually surrender the city to the Demo
crats.
Such being the issues that confront the Republicans
of San Francisco, there ought to be no hesitation on
the part of any good and true upholder of the party
and its principles to ur.ite with the clubs of the league
rind take an active share in the work for honest poli
tics and good government. Any kind of indifference
or negligence of political duties at this time is vir
tually a consent to boss domination, for the only al
ternative to genuine Republicanism is just that kind
of control.
It is to be borne in mind that in effecting the or
ganization of genuine Republicans in the district clubs
the league gave every assurance that the work was to
be done in the interests of the party and of the city,
and not of individuals. An advisory committee was
appointed, made up of men who are well known not
only in politics but in business and professional cir
cles, and whose names are a guarantee of every pledge
made by the league. It is therefore with undoubted
right that the league claims the support of all stanch
and true Republicans in the contest against the pre
datory bosses and their unscrupulous allies.
In order to accomplish those purposes the league
set about organizing Republican clubs in the various
Assembly districts. They have received a gratifying
support from the genuine Republicans of the city,
and of their effectiveness there is no question. Events
now occurring show how important such organiza
tions are. The bosses, whose very names are a by
word and a reproach to the politics of the city, have
found support from men like the Governor of the
State, Lynch of the Federal brigade and Herrin of
the Southern Pacific. Had there been no organiza
tion on the part of the league the better elements of
the Republican party would now be at a hopeless dis
advantage in the contest, and the chances of nomi
nating a party ticket that will command the confidence
of the people would be slight indeed.
FOR the purpose of rousing public interest in
the approaching municipal election, and to as
sure the success of honest, politics under the new
primary law, the Republican Primary League was
formed. It was never the intention of the founders
of the league nor of those who have since united with
it to make use of it in advancing the fortunes of any
candidate or set of candidates; neither was it, nor
is it, the intention to use it to antagonize any can
didate. Its objects were and are those of awakening
the people to a sense of the importance of primary
elections and of promoting genuine Republicanism.

At the close of the war Colonel Jenks removed to Chicago
and immediately began the study of portrait painting. In this
specialty he attained marked success, and after a few years
started West. He visited Colorado, remained for a season at
San Francisco, and then located in Los Angeles.

(T denly In Los Angeles several days ago, bore a reraark
(L able resemblance to Andrew Carnegie, the great Bteel
magnate and philanthropist. The two men, one noted
for his many munificent gifts to various cities in this
country, and the other as a painter of .portraits, could easily
have been taken for twin brothers: The late Colonel Jenks was
not alone famous as a painter, but he also had a career of
prominence in the army. At the opening of the Civil "War he
patriotically left art and business and organized a company of
cavalry. He first served under' General Slgel, and later with
General Rosecrans. He was also with General Grant for five
months, becoming a warm personal friend of the soldier Pres
ident, and later served under General Sheridan. He successively

jurious to the contractors. The contractors de
murred and asked for payment of interest on the
money they had already tied up. A second board met,
and its report is now pending in Washington. This
has dragged on for eighteen months."
It is certajnly within the scope of their rightful in
terest in public affairs that our merchants and other
citizens of influence should insistently urge the Navy
Department to sign the contract for the stone dry
dock and go ahead with the work. It cannot be con
structed in a day, and the sooner it is begun the
better.
It is worth noting in this connection that the fact
that three battleships are awaiting a chance to enter
the drydock at Bremerton has aroused the active
spirits of the Puget Sound citiqs to make an earnest
effort to procure the construction of another drydock
of the. largest class at that point. It therefore be
hooves the people of California to present the claims
of Mare Island at once and^keep them present in the
minds of Congress and of the administration untitl
the desired work is obtained. ... . & j ? . _____ *
The issue is one of interest to the whole nation.'
The Puget Sound stations can never be wholly safe
so long as the British retain their tremendous and
formidable military and naval station at the straits
through' which the Sound opens to the sea. The
Mare Island Navy-yard is safe, and in time of war
a ship more or less disabled would never have to
pass anywhere near an enemy's guns in seeking it for
repairs. Moreover, it is the center of all the com
merce on this side of the Pacific. The nation can
not afford to have a second-rate naval station . at
Mare Island, nor can it afford to leave unused the
magnificent facilities that have been already estab
lished there. For those reasons the people of San
Francisco and of California will have ample grounds
to justify their insistence that the Navy Department
and Congress shall each in its way build up and make
use of the station. To that end they should unite,
and every member of Congress from California
whether Senator or Representative, should be pledged
to do whatever lies in his power to promote the
movement.
Â» ,â¢ _ Â¦
SINCE a number of the leading business men of
San Francisco have made a visit of inspection
to Mare Island Navy-yard and have noted both
the magnitude of the plant and the comparatively little
use that is being made of it, there is good reason for
expecting they will exert their influence to obtain
from Congress *the appropriations required to make
such improvements as are necessary, and also to
bring about a fuller use of the existing plant than is
now being made by the Navy Department.
There can be no question of the imperative need
of a new drydock at Mare Island and of a deeper
channel. At the present time the construction of new
battleships and other war vessels has gone beyond
the navy-yard facilities for taking care of them. On
this coast the Oregon, the Wisconsin and the Iowa
are awaiting repairs, and all three of them have been
sent to Bremerton, on Puget Sound. There each of
them has to await its turn, and as the Wisconsin and
Iowa have precedence, it will probably be several
months before the much needed repairs on the Ore
gon can be made.
In the meantime the work of. constructing a new
drydock at Mare Island waits. In describing the sit
uation concerning it to the visiting merchants Mr.
Campbell, secretary of the Vallejo Chamber of Com
merce, said: "There was appropriated $750,000 for
a new dock, large enough for battleships, to be made
of wood. A contract was let. Then our Congress
men thought it would be better to have it made of
stone. They got an additional $300,000 appropriation.
But 'the contract had already been signed, and the
contractors demanded, more money for building it of
stone. A naval board met and returned a report in-
MARE ISLAND NAVY-YARD.
A Connecticut woman followed a peddler for a mile,
then knocked him down with a rock and robbed him
of $15. After that who will say the new woman is
not up with the procession?
These facts of Herrin's career are not matters of
guesswork. He has been secret and he has been cun
ning, but he has not been able to hide his trail.
Should President Hays or the directors of the road
choose to make an investigation they can find abun
dant evidence that Herrin's dirty work in politics is
done as well for his private practice as for the cor
porations he is supposed to serve. If, therefore, the
order of President Hays concerning the misuse of
railroad influence and money in political intrigues is
not to become a farce Herrin must go.
So far as appears from the record his service con
sisted solely in signing his name to a brief. Of course na
sane man will believe that he was so richly rewarded
for the mere use of his name. It is evident that he
was able to extract the promise of a large sum from
the litigants only because he was believed to have
influence with the bench and had a pull on the deci
sion. In short, Herrin uses the money of corpora
tions to support corrupt bosses, uses the bosses to
put corrupt men in office and "on the bench, and then
uses those corrupt creatures as a means of enriching
himself. . ,
As an illustration of his method of doing business
in that way the fact may be cited that he is to receive
a princely fee in the Fair will case. It is not known
that he made any argument in that case or did any
other legal work in it, and yet he is to be paid a large
sum for his service.
By the use sometimes of Spring Valley money,
sometimes of the street railroad money, sometimes of
Southern Pacific money, and sometimes of all three,
Herrin has been able through his alliance with Kelly
to get some of his creatures on the State Board of
Equalization, the Railroad Commission and even on
the judicial bench. Having put his creatures into
those offices he makes the fullest use of them to his
own advantage. It is not solely for the corporations
that he uses them, for in addition to the three offices
which he holds as attorney he also does a shrewd law
business on his own account. Having the reputation
of having a secret but powerful influence with the
bench, he is able to be of use to clients who have big
cases and who can pay big fees.
In his political adventures Herrin has chosen to
array himself against the people of San Francisco and
ally himself with Boss Kelly. His reason for doing
so is not due wholly to the personal charms and con
geniality which he finds, in Kelly's companionship.
The two are acting together because it is mutually
profitable. By putting their tools into office Kelly
is able to work certain jobs which are remunerative
to him, and Herrin works others which are even
more remunerative.
President Hays has given orders that the employes
of the Southern Pacific Company shall give their
energies to the business for which they are paid and
keep out of politics. That order Herrin has not
obeyed. Doubtless President Hays sees to it that
Herrin uses none of the money of the Southern Pa
cific Company in his political adventures, but that
does not prevent him from using the money of the
water company and that of the street railway corpora
tion; nor, so long as he holds an important office
in the Southern Pacific Company, does it prevent
him from using the prestige of that^ position to fur
ther his schemes. Â» ,
Judged by his activities Herrin, like Cerberus of
old, is a three-headed dog with a serpent's tail; one
head serves the Southern Pacific, another serves the
Spring Valley Water Company, while the third serves
the Market Street Railway Company. As for the ser
pentine tail of him, it is forever wriggling and squirm
ing and poisoning where it can in California politics.
t' tt tHEN President Hays returns to San tfran
\/\/ cisco he' will do well to give his undivided
V * |attienttonffqr a while to the political adven
tures of.W. F. Herrin, who uses and abuses the office
of attorney for the Southern Pacific Company. In
deed, he would do better, perhaps, if he would give
his attention to the subject now and submit the mat
ter to the directors of the road when he meets them
in New York.

It is asserted that the funds of the local
committee will fall short of requirements
to the amount of $3900. Had the officers
of the league paid their own expenses,
the same as the more humble members
of that body, this deficiency might not
now exist. The practice of guaranteeing
the expenses of the officials alluded to
is an old one. but should the league ever
sgain come to this city It is quite likely
that the officers will pay their own bills.
The greater part of the money sent to
the programme committee was used to
defray the traveling expenses to this city
and return of members to their homes.
Among these were Bishop Joyce, the Rev.
J. F. Berry, the RÂ«v. H. M. Du Bose. the
Rev. A. C. Crews, and several others, all
officials of hijrh standing in the interna
tional league. It is understood that the
entire sura was not disbursed and that
the surplus will be returned to the local
committee. Whatever the sum may be.
it will be devoted to paying the bill of
the Palace Hotel for live days' board at
that hostelry of a dozen or more of the
â¢convention officials, these claims not hav
ing been l.p-ured by the programme com
mittee in the expense account to be met
by the UQOQ appropriated by the local
committee.
As the months passed away and the
time for holding the convention ap
proached, the programme committee,
which seemed lo believe that the prom
ises made by San Francisco would not be
carried out, sent out two emissaries in
December last to survey the situation.
These were Judge J\ D. Fuller, secretary
of the programme committee, and Dr.
R. S. Copeland. ft professor in the Uni
versity of Michigan, and at present Mayor
of Ann Arbor, Mich. These gentlemen
had several animated conferences with
the local committee relative to the con
ditions subscribed to at Indianapolis, the
result being that the> sum of $4000 was paid
over. It now transpires that the expenses
of Messrs. Fuller and Copeland while
here were paid out of this sum. The ne
cessity for Incurring this additional ex
pense did not, according to the local com
mittee, exist.
The international committee was not
entirely satisfied with this assurance,
but the members exacted a heavy bond
that all the promises made would be car
ried out to the letter. Among the condi
tions Imposed was one requiring that $4000
be paid to the programme committee in
advance to defray the expenses of the
league officials and of certain programme
speakers, none of whom It was repre
sented could be expected to travel as far
as San Francises) at their own expense.
When the effort to secure the conven
tion for San Francisco was made two
years ago at Indianapolis the committee
on resolutions was very determined in
the enforcement of its demands.. It was
not content to accept the word of the San
Francisco delegation that a sufficient sum
of money would be raised to meet all rea
sonable expenses and provide the visitors
vrlth suitable entertainment.

and other advocates of clean government
are somewhat embarrassed by the candi
dacy of Frank. French for Recorder. The
old Burns push, to which French belongs,
claims to be independent and to be ani
mated by a purpose to secure something
Thirty-Sixth District.
W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific
law department may be compelled to show
his party colors on August 13. The pri
mary election law requires that the voter
when securing his ballot- shall write his
name and designate the political party
whose candidates he expects to support
at the municpal election. Herrin lives in
the Forty-first District. If he votes at
the primary election he will be obliged to
show his colors and say whether he is a
Democrat or Republican. Of course, he
can declare himself a Republican at the
primary election and secretly vote for
Democratic nominees at the municipal
election, but at the primary he cannot
play double. The- choice of party ballots
will be presented to him. He can take
either but he cannot take both. He may
decide to dodge the issue by keeping away
from the polls. " Â¦'Â¦'sl~-' .... â_.
The promoters of the Republican Pri
mary League are making an open, square
and manly fight for clean local govern
ment. In the line of organization and ef
fective methods of enrollment the fight is
one of the best ever put up In San Fran
cisco. Delegate tickets placed in the field
under the auspices of the Republican Pri
mary League, Thomas P. Woodward,
president, will be the only genuine anti
boss tickets of the day. The league has
absolutely refused to entertain proposals
to compromise in any sense with the
Kelly-Gage boss gang-
In two or three districts independent
clubs/ whose rolls embrace the names of
reputable citizens, have been outgeneraled
and persuaded to an alliance with boss
elements. Candidates for office in some
Instances have been instrumental in pro
moting compromise with bosses, A can
didate who is now willing to sacrifice for
individual advancement the principles or
anti-boss municipal government deserves
the rebuke of every good citizen in- the
community.
Herrin Must Show His Colors.
THE allied bosses, with Kelly and
Gage as the chief figureheads,
are making a still hunt for re
cruits. They dare not come out
in the open and put up Kelly-
Gage tickets In the several Assembly dis
tricts. They prefer to make overtures to
independent clubs with the hope of get
ting a few delegates and combining as.
many elements as possible against the
Republican Primary League. All along
the line the bosses are showing signs of
weakness and demoralization. If Sara
Rainey fails to come to time with a big
reinforcement of Democrats the Republi
can boss alliance will make a poor show-
Ing of strength at the polls on August
13. The rooms engaged early in the cam
paign as Tilden County Committee head
quarters are not visited by representative
citizens. The daily attendance consists
of three attaches and four loungers. The
bosses In all their political experience
never had such an overlook. ,' ,
Sam Rainey and Martin Kelly met day
before yesterday to size up' the situation.
They decided to put up as strong a fight
as possible in the Forty-fourth district.
"We are met here," said Boyne, "in the
Interest of honest government for the city.
We have a big fight on our hands, a fight
against the men who seek to hand the
city back into the control of 'the old
bosses, Kelly and ... Crlmmlns. It is'tho
just duty of honest Republicans to see
The Primary League Republican Club
of the Forty-third Assembly District had
a rousing meeting at California Hall last
night. President Frank P. Shibeley was
in the chair and Fred Tobermann was
secretary. The president stated briefly
that the meeting Itari been called to select
candidates for delegates to the city con
vention, to be voted for at the primaries 11
on August 13, and then George Boyne took
the floor and made a stirring speech.

The Primary League ticket, of the
Thirty^sixth will represent the principles
of . honest, progressive local government.
The ticket should be elected. Every citizen
interested in the prosperity and advance
ment of the district should vote the Pri
mary League anti-boss ticket. Let Lack
mann and French take their chances In a
convention of representative Republican
citizens. When the taxpayers, business
men and workingmen of other districts
hear that the people of the Thirty-sixth
are ready to bow to the yoke of the bosses
In order to help Frank French to an office
and Boss Kelly to a delegation the feel
ing toward the Thirty-sixth will not be
over friendly. There are mo side issues.
The fight -is on between the people .. and
the allied bosses. Tax . plunderers from
Los Angeles, Sonoma ana other counties
have been imported by the State Central
Committee to help Boss Kelly loot the
city. The property owners of the Thirty
sixth District owe it to themselves and
the city in which they live to llnÂ« up
against the bosses. * v-V*
for the Thirty-sixth. Deputy Sheriffs in
terested in John Lackmann's fight are
helping French In the work of dividing
the anti-boss forces in the district. Citi
zens of the district should take notice of
the situation. Property-owners and tax
payers of the Thirty-sixth are just as
much concerned in the cause of honest
municipal government as are the people of
any other subdivision of the city. They
can get along in a case of great extremity
without French for Recorder or Lack
mann for .Sheriff, but they cannot expect
prosperity if they, consent to filling the
City Hall with bosses and tax-raiders.

J. W. Shanahan, president of the organ
ization, presided at a " meeting of the
Democratic Club of the Forty-third As
sembly District last night, called to select
delegates to be voted for at the primaries
to choose. a city convention. The execu
tive committee of the club had selected a
list of delegates, .which was approved by
the club, as follows:
Forty-Third District Democrats.
On motion a committee of three, con
sisting of George Boyne, John Harney and
James D. Hart, was appointed to select
seventeen names from the list of those
nominated to serve as delegates the
names to be submitted to the club for Its
approval at the next meeting.
The club then adjourned to the call cf
the chair.
George Boyne, John Wilson, James D. Hart,

that this effort does not succeed. We can
do our part in this work only by selecting
here to-night seventeen men for delegates
who will make up so strong a ticket that
it cannot be beaten. It is true that the
State Central Committee, in giving us
only seventeen delegates, has not treated
us as well as we deserve, nevertheless let
us see that the men chosen are strong
?nen. If they are we can win out."
The president then declared nominations
for delegates in order, and the following
were placed In nomination:
dent of free delivery of the Postofflce De
partment, will sail August 1 on the Sierra
for Honolulu, where he goes to install free
delivery. He will be in Honolulu three or
four weeks, and when he departs the res
idents of the Hawaiian capital will be en
joying the benefits of the best mail ser
vice that Uncle Sam can give.
Postmaster Oat of Honolulu is now In
San Francisco. He reports that a civil
service examination for carriers has been
held and an eligible list is ready. The con
ditions in Honolulu are somewhat difficult
for free delivery, as mail steamers arrive
at intervals of about a week, bringing the
mail in masses, making it harder to han
dle than if the mails were daily. Mr. Ir
win does not know how many carriers
will be required.
Honolulu has not had the benefit of free
delivery because the houses have not been
numbered and many of the streets have
not been named, t The Legislature passed
a bill providing for that work. Stanley
Stephenson, formerly of Alameda, who
secured the contract, is now in San Fran
cisco and he reports g-ood progress in pre
paring the city for improved postal ser
vice. Oat and Stephenson will both re
turn to Honolulu on the Sierra.
Mr. Irwin has traveled 43,000 miles in
the last thirteen months in the. discharge
of his official duties. Within that time
he discharged a special mission in the
Philippines. Two years and a half ago
he Installed the American postofflce at
Havana, Cuba.

The annual picnic and reunion of St.
Patrick's Parish was held yesterday at
Shell Mound Park. The weather was
pleasant and the outing was enjoyed by
fully 2000 members of the Mission street
church.
It was essentially a day of enjoyment
for the little ones of the parish. The
swings, the merry-go-rounds, the Ice
cream and peanut stands were liberally
patronized by Father Â¦ Cummins' narish
ioners. The fathers and mothers and the
elder sisters and brothers of the small
boys and girls spent the day in dancing
and watching the antics of the young
sters. ' ' â¢
The games committee prepared an ex
cellent programme of sports. Young: la
dies, married ladles, single and married
men and school boys and gtrls contested
for numerous prizes in all sorts of ath
letic games, and furnished a great deal of
amusement.
The success of the affair was due to the
efforts of the following committees:

There will be fifty people In the com
pany, and a special orchestra will accom
pany the aggregation. ,
Aa the grand opera season at the Tivoli,
which opens on Monday next, continues
four rronths the present company will be
absent from this city quite a length of
time. Within the next week the company
will make a flying trip to Eureka to play
a short engagement. Upon its return
preparations will be made for its depart
ure. The aggregation will open in Taco
ma and will play a. two weeks' cngae
ment. Among the operas to be produced
are "Babes in the Wood," "Wedding
Day," "Toymaker" and "Wizard of the
Nile." The company will play three weeks
in Seattle, three weeks in Portland; and
If the Tacoma engagement is successful
the company wfll return to that city and
play another v;eok. Two weeks will be de
voted to Victoria and Vancouver. .
These companies will be sent out from
this city fully equipped. All scenery neces
sary, all costumes, properties and other
necessaries, will be furnished by the Tivoli
Opera-house. Teddy' Hartman * will be
stage director, as he Is here, and James
F. Leahy will look after the mangerial
end of this big undertaking. , "
The proposed trip is the result of nego
tiations and planning by Mrs. Ernestine
Kreling. It has long been her wish that
the playgoers of the north have an op
portunity of enjoying the operas that have
been so greatly enjoyed In this city. Ar
rangements have therefore been entered
into with John F. Cordray of Cordray's
Theater, Portland; J. P. Howe of the
Seattle Theater, Seattle; Shrader & Green
of the Lyceum Theater, Tacoma, and
playhouses In Victoria and Vancouver for
the production of comic opera.
The result of these bookings has led
MrSi Kreling and her able assistant,
"Doc" Leahy, to make arrangements for
the organization of two more comic opera
companies, so that these^ organizations
may be constantly on the move In that
section and In this State. It has been
Mrs. Kreling's dream to have a chain of
opera-houses along the coast, and she
now sees the realization of her fond wish.
Theater-goers of the north have a treat
in store. The Tlvoll comic opera company
Is to depart from this city on August 9
and play engagements In Portland, Seat
tle, Tacoma, Victoria and Vancouver. The
Thespians will leave these shores under
the wings of Teddy Hartman, comedian,
and James F. Leahy, a brother of the ge
nial manager, of the local opera-house.

NEW YORK, July 25.â The upward reaction
in stocks this morning marked another phase
in the speculation. Such intermittent move
ments from day to day are a familiar Incident
of periods when speculative factors have large
ly spent their force and no new ones of impor
tance are in sight to takeHhelr place. It does
not necessarily follow that there are not large
rpeculatlve commitments still existing in the
market. Â« Some further light is evidently
awaited on the actual results to the crops of
the period of drought in the West, which has
formed, together with the eteel strike, the basis
of the recent speculation for the fall. Declin
ing activity and lessening calculations are the
natural accompaniments of fucIi a period. It
is to be assumed that a short interest exists
in the market as a consequence of the recent
dewrward course of prices, and consequently
the absence of any new unfavorable develop
ments, by begetting an easy frame of mind in
the shorts, keeps the undertone of the market
f.rm. There is the additional consideration that
stocks in the general list, which are not directly
concerned at all in the vicissitudes of crops,
have 6uSfered from depression by sympathy with
thos-e that are. There are evidences to-day
that the level of prices of some of these proved'
attractive at the low level. The professional
traders, anxious to develop a new speculative
movement. Joined in the buying and helped to
advance prices. The bituminous coal carriers,
the anthracite group and some of the roads in
the Southern region were prominent -In the lead
ership of. this movement and helped to hold
a dull market firm through the middle portion
of the session. The announcement of "the en
gagement at the assay office of $500,000 in gold
eent prices downward again, but not to the low
eet. The gold is supposedly for export, although
the destination is not announced. The fact
that gold should go out with the exchange mar
ket, yielding to the supply created by large for
eign buying of grain to-day aroused renewed
attention to the fact that some special demand
for gold exists abroad which can draw It from
New York -with exchange below the normal gold
export point. The market became so nearly
stagnant at the decline that the courage of the
bulls was revived and they marked up prices
again. The eaaden advance of about 2 points
each in United States Steel stocks and an
earlier advance of as much In Amalgamated
Copper helped to make the closing strong and
quite active, with many stocks back at the top
level of the day. There was considerable manip
ulation evident on the advance, the principal
part of which was restricted to a small circle.
Railroad bonds were, more active than yester
day and there was a large demand for the
bonds exchangeable for Burlington stock and
com* buying also of Baltimore and Ohio con
vertible bonds. The market generally was
somewhat Irregular. Total sales, par value
n.620.000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

of last night's rains in the Northwest, to easy
cables and also to the weakness of corn prices.
September sold from 71c to 70^c, under pressure
of long stuff. Following this there was an al
most Instant recovery to 71?ic on reports v of
rising temperatures In the spring wheat coun
try. It was feared that the heat would be par
ticularly damaging | . following I the rains so
quickly.. The market faltered for a time at this
advance and then continued upward on reports
of rain delaying harvesting in France and a
cable claiming that the Russian crop was rap
idly deteriorating. . The strength at this time
being displayed by corn was a "contributory fac
tor in the firmness. Later in the session the
corn reaction and a decline in Northwestern
markets became potent factors and September
declined and closed rather weak. Tie under yes
terday, at 71%c.
That it is an extremely difficult matter to
judge the weather report3 received from various
sources was shown by the action of the corn
market. Before the beginning, of the session
private reports had it that Iowa had received
a fair drenching and that there had been scat
tered showers in other parts of the corn belt.
Under a rush/ of selling:, orders September
opened at from 56c to 55c, touched 56%c and
then rushed back to 55%c in short order. Un
favorable weather reports caused a reaction
the market going up- to 57%c. A report saying
that rain within the week would brighten the
prospects of 75 per cent of the crop caused a
decline to 55%c. The close was %c lower at 56c
Oats averaged weak with corn during a nerv
ous and comparatively quiet session. Septem
ber closed %c lower at 35%c.
Provisions were dull, the pit at times being
almost deserted. After fluctuating narrowly
prices closed 2^c lower all around.

DECIDUOUS FRUITS.
As far as the strike is concerned. the situation
showed still â¢ more - improvement yesterday.
There were more teams In operation, though
most of them were driven by the commission
men or their clerks. The receipts were.very
light, which was a great help to the commis
sion men. Besides much fruit which has been
destined for San Francisco canneries has been
diverted to the different canneries In the in
terior. The local canners, however,' succeeded
In getting considerable fruit hauled. One large
receiving house reported that the canners took
all tha,t came in to them, so that they were
not obliged to sell any to the retail trade.
Prices accordingly showed more firmness and
some advance was reported. Very little good
fr,uit was seen on the floors or sidewalks after
noon, though there was considerable half
spoiled stock waiting buyers. Arrivals of
Grapes Â¦were extremely limited. Melons were in
larger supply and rather weak. Peaches were
higher and Plums and Prunes continued firm.
Thus far during the strike they have not de
clined. They have been in remarkably good
demand this year, i Nectarines also did better.

Auditor A. H. Breed has a second time
refused to draw warrants in favor of the
Contra Costa Water Company for pay
ment of the bills for Water supplied dur
ing the last fiscal year, amounting to $26,
000.
Such was that official's stand to-day,
when the company's representatives,
armed with the ratifying ordinance signed
by Mayor Barstow, made a formal de
mand for the warrants. â¢
The Auditor declared his opinion that
the claims, In spite of the ordinance,
were still Illegal, and for that reason,
coupled with his desire not to jeopardize
any of the city's interests in the water
rate iitigation, he declined to issue the
warrants.
Upon this refusal the water company
will make a second attempt by mandamus
proceedings in the Superior Court to com
pel the Auditor to draw the warrants.
The first suit the company instituted was
never brought to Issue because the com
plaint was found to be fatally defective.
Now, with the r.ew ordinance, which rati
fies and confirms all acts of the City Coun
cil with relation to the disputed water
bills, the corporation has hope that its
case will rest upon more substantial
ground. "
So far as the Auditor Is concerned, he
gars he will not retire from his position
until the court of- last resort has finally
passed upon the case. That means a year
or more must pass before the issue can
be settled in the Supreme Court, no mat
ter which way the litigation shall ter
minate. Â¦ * i v.. Â¦
The Auditing and Finance Committee of
the City Council to-night recommended a
transfer of $20,000 of the balances in the
treasury, as follows:
From the salary fund to the general
fund, $5000; from the street light fund to
the general fund, $5000; from the police
fund to the High school fund, $10,000. This
will pay the salaries of the High school
teachers for March and April last and
will ease the pressure on the general fund
claims, but will leave unsettled the High
school salaries for May and June. The
committee refused to make all of the
transfers recommended by Auditor Breed.
Councilman Schaffer charged the Auditor
with attempting to "flimflam" the Coun
cil in the financial statement that had
been submitted concerning the condition
of the funds. He said: "The. Auditor's
statement is deceptive. He says if you
make these transfers you will leave $27,000
in the treasury after settling all bills but
the water company's claims. That is not
so He has included in his balances $3800
for the police and pension fund and $5000
estimated to come in from delinquent
taxes, but the former is not in the treas
ury and the property owners have five
years in which to pay the delinquencies."
"It's a case of flimflam," said Council
man "Wixson. ,.,,â'
"If it is not fllmflamming, I would like
to know what it is." said Schaffer. The
Auditor's request for a general transfer
was indefinitely postponed and the $20,
000 transfer, as Introduced by Chairman
Courtney, was recommended".

and these recent purchases are being

is purchased. Additions are made to the
already large holdings of the syndicate In
acreage land.
Now comes the assertion' that is made
from a source within the syndicate, .that
a large, suburban hotel is to be erected
upon the Dingee place in Hayes Canyon,
that the Piedmont branch of the Transit
Company's system is to be extended to
the Dingee place, and that this is to bo
made an all-the-year-round resort for
tourists. The property is admirably suited
for such a scheme, for the grounds are
already laid out as a private park, and It
would need but the construction of the
hotel building.
The deal is not completed, for Mr. Hen
shaw Has only made the. agreements with
the stockholders of the Hay wards line,
and the transfer has yet to- take 'place.
This will be completed before the end 01
the week, and by the first of August the
last and only independent street railroad
system in Oakland will Tie In the hands of
the Oakland Transit Company. ,
The Oakland Transit Company will con-,
trol Â¦ every street railroad In .Oakland
before the week Is out. William G. Hcn
shaw, who .yesterday completed the pur
chase of a controlling- interest in the Oak
land, San Leandr'o and Hay wards Electric
Railroad, will turn that road over to the
Oakland Transit Company, and make that
company the owner of every line of street
railroad on this side of the bay.

by Major. Gilmore fqr a medal of honor

Caridad, on the Island of Leyte, and was
recommended for brevet rank by Colonels

. First Lieutenant Buchanan of the Fpr
ty-fourth "Volunteer Infantry, which was
mustered out at the Presidio a few weeks
ago, has been recommended by the Presi
dent for a second lieutenant's commission

LIEUTENANT BTTCBCA2TAN'
HAS A GREAT RECORD
"The upshot of-lt will be the carrying
of the case Into the Federal courts, and
that we are prepared to do. The suit will
be begun probably within the next ten
days. The claim will be of course that
the agreement by which the Bellingham
Bay Company is kept out is a combina
tion in restraint of trade."
"Further, wo were told that If a stamp
was given us we would use it to stamp
lumber planed up north ' or somewhere
else, which is. like arresting a man pass
ing along the street because you are
afraid he lit going to steal. However, I
met that objection by offering to put a
bond for $10,000 in the hands of the Build
ing Trades Council, to be forfeited In case
of the misuse Of the stamp. They re
fused, however, to give me a hearing. I
will try again, but I have no hope that I
will bo heard, although the Bellingham
Bay Company has never taken sides
against the union and was one of the llrst
concerns to send work to the mill started
by the men at the time of the strike. : .
"When I demanded reasons for this dis
crimination against the Bellingham Bay
Company I whs told that our mill was too
small to b,o taken into the association. \VÂ«
offered at 6nce, if they would furnish us
specifications, to build a mill that would
till the bill, but no attention was paid to
the offer. Â¦ .
"Now, the' significance of this refusal
lies in this: Under the agreement by
which the strike of last year in the plan
ing mills was settled all planed lumber
used in building in San Francisco and
Alameda counties must bear the union
stamp. That stamp is issued by the
Building Trades Council to members of
tho Planing Mill Men's Association, and
if wo are not in the association we' cannot
get the stamp. It follows that we cannot
employ union men In our mill, and that,
in effect, we are kept from going into
business at all.
"Some -time ago," said Mr. Cornwall
yesterday, "the Bellingham Bay Improve
ment Company, which I represent, built
a small pianingr mill. The Bellingham
Bay Company isa concern that Is and has
always been In sympathy with union la
bor. It employs none but union men and
wages no war now on unions. When the
new mill was built our people made for
mal' application for membership in the
Planing Mill Men's Association, accom
panying the application with a check for
$100. That application for membership
was refused.
It is extremely probable that the Fed
eral courts will be asked to pass upon the
validity of the agreement, between the
Building- Trades Council and the Planlns
Mill Men's Association, by which the
strike of a little less than a year ago was
settled. The suit, If it is broughtâ and
there is every likelihood that it will beâ
will be begun by Attorney Bruce Corn
wall on behalf of the Bellingham Bay Im
provement Company.
Claim Made That New Plan
ing Mills Are All

forth, and to appoint In each State and Terri
tory of the Union one person to be known aa the
organizer of subordinate branches of this con
grcrs, â¢ the same to be done until-, said articles
of confederation are formed and adopted un
der the direction of the president and secretary
of the International Mining. Congress.
Resolved, That steps should be taken at this
meeting of the International Mining Congress
to properly and systematically Inaugurate this
movement: and further be it
Whereas, The primary and most important
purposes of this congress are to inaugurate a
movement that will ultimately result In the
establishment by the national Government of
a. bureau or department of mining; and where
as, In order to accomplish that purpose It -will
be necessary to bring before the people of the
United States and present to them in form
such information upon that question as will
convince them of the great importance of the
movement; and whereas, in order to success
fully disseminate this information subordinate
branches of this conjrress should be created in
all States of this Union in order that through
these subordinate branches this work may be
carried on under the directions of the Interna
tional Congress: therefore be it
A number of resolutions were adopted,

CREMATION.
The Odd Fellows' Cemetery Association,
Point Lob as ave., ;.-. F., Cal;
The ordinance prohibiting burials In San
Francisco after the first day of August, 1901
does not refer to CREMATION. Neither does
It affect the COLUMBARIUM, because there is
nothing less harmful to the living than the
ashes of their dead. / . .
Permits to cremate will be issued by the

In operation, were enthusiastic: over its
work. â¢ ' . :..
The test was made at 10 o'clock yester
day morning In the big lot at the corner
of Bay and Stockton streets. Four pow
erful engines pumped heavy streams into
the -tower and the water- belched forth
from the nozzle with force enough to
knock down a brick wall. The test was a
i thorough one. In every respect. More than
1 an hour was devoted to manipulating the
wonderful piece of mechanism, and at tho
close of the trial Mr. Gorter was con
gratulated for having perfected a tower
that has no equal.
Mr. Gorter's new tower weighs five and
one-hnlf tons, which is the uverage weight
of a flre engine. It la a vast improve

ago. It Is not unlike it In build, but pre

HOPES- ARE EXPRESSED
FOR SHELDON'S RECOVERY
Secretary of Oceanic Steamship Com*
pony Holdo His Otto After
Dangerous Operation.
Edward H. Sheldon, the secretary of the
j Oceanic Steamship Company, who was
operated on last Tuesday at the Lane
Hospital for Intestinal obstruction, was
reported yesterday evening to be holding
his own and the surgeons in attendance
are hopeful that their patient will recover.
Mr. Sheldon was taken ill about three
weeks ago~ and was removed from Saus-
I alito last Monday to the hospital, where
i he now is. Drs. Rixford. Moffltt, ' Mays
I and Lorlni. who perfocmed the dangerous
j operation, are unable to state. that Mr.
Sheldon will recover his health, but they
hope for the best.
. After the operation on Tuesday Mr.
Sheldon passed a comfortable night, ami
during the whole day yesterday no change
was noted in his condition.
At the Lane Hospital 'the patient Is re
ceiving the best of attention, and last
evening the nurses in attendance stated
that, barring a sudden change, Mr.. Shel
don could be pronounced out of danger Â¦
. ' Mr. ' Sheldon has a host of friends' in
this city, both in' club circles- and the
business community, and the news of his
illness has been received with the deepest
regret. -
of. seventy-six feet by water pressure.
This is an Improvement over the old tow
er, which could only be raised to a height
of forty-nine feet and had to be elevated
by hand power. The new tower can go
into action within a few minutes after It
has takmi its station- before a burning
building. The nozzle can -be swung thlrty
flve depreewout of. the perpendicular, and
can therefore sweep an entire building
liko a ; gatling gun. Like a man-of-war,
the tower is provided with a secondary
battery. This battery Is located at, its
base and is also telescopic. It can be
raised ten feet In height and may be used
with great success for flres In second and
third stories of buildings.
The new- water tower will go into com
mission within a few days. It will be. sta
tioned at 'No. 4 engine-house, on Second
street, near Mission. With this new tow
er In service Chlof Sullivan may glory In
the fact- that he hna the finest fire appn
rntua in the world. The Chief Is Jubilant
over the new tower. Ho wild yesterday:
"It Is unquestionably the finest fire tool
In the world to-day. There Is nothing that
can enunl It. I am pleased to say that
every bolt and nut. everything on it. has
been manufactured In our own corpora
tion yard. We watched Its progress dur
ing the past two years and are delighted
with its success. It is 80 per cent better
thnn the old tower."

Years Ago He Killed His Opponent in a Duel and Was Exiled, but Kaiser
' Wilhelm Pardons Him and Restores Him to Favor.
There is a great amount of mystery sur
rounding the Count and Countess von
Larlsch, who are at present staying at
the Grand Hotel. The Count refuses to
see any representatives of the press and
to all cards that are sent to his rooms
returns word that "he is out."
To one person, however, he has been a
little confidential and. has stated that his
visit to California is on behalf or tne
German Government. Ho nays that he
does not know what. the mission is. but
that he Is to shortly receive Important
papers instructing him how he la to act.
Count von Larlsch has had a romantic
career. When quite n young man he be
came involved in a quarrel in the army
with one of his nuperlor officers wnlgn
led to a duel. He killed hla man and was
exiled from Germany nnd nil' his estates
cor.flneated. HÂ« enme to this country ana
worked, earning a living In a modest man
ner. ' ' , ' .
Recently, however, he wan pardoned and
wns allowed to return to his native coun
try. He 'was appointed to service for tho
Gorman Government, and one of his first
mlw<lona was to represent the German
Government In Ottawa at the reception
tendered to the Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York.
The Count says .'that ..when he arrived

Trouble on the St.* Katherine.
While on the run from San Francisco to
Hilo one of tho.crew of the bark St. Kath
erlne fell > overboard ' and was -drowned.
Captain Saunders was unable to v nll the
vacancy-at the-islands^ and- the crew re
fused to take the vessel to sea, claiming
that she was 'short-handed. The captain
explained that he could not get another
man, but thersailors would, not .give in.
When ordered' to get the vessel ready for
sea they- retired to the . forecastle and re
fused duty. Â¦ -;Â¦Â¦â¢"
When Captain Saunders saw-the temper
of the men he did, not waste any words on
them, but went ashore*-- and hired ten
Kanakas to get ithe bark ready and then
secured a tug' to i take her -to sea. The
towboat took- the St. Katherinean extra
long distance; out, and; by that time the
Kanakas had the -decks cleared and the
vessel ready to make sail. \ When all was
ready the tug j came alongside and took
the natives off. The sailors then went to
work and brought the bark to San Fran
cisco. . â¢
Wednesday the sailors were to have
been -paid, off, but they ..would not.accept
their .wages. , - Every one of them had been

Work Is again progressing on three
steamships that would now be in commis
sion had it not been for the strike. On
the transport Sherman a couple of gangs
of men went to work last week and this
force was gradually â¢ increased until yes
terday, when six gangs were at work.
The remodeling of the troopship is now
slowly .but surely proceeding and by the
end of August she should be ready for
sea. Workmen are also busy on the new
steamships Alaskan and Spokane, but it
will be some time before they are com
pleted. The Spokane was to have been
ready for the Alaskan excursion season,
but It looks now as though it would be
next year before she goes north. â¢

Powers Still Fighting.
Attorney Frank H. Powers will make
another effort before Judge Muraaky this
morning to establish his contention that
the teachers of this city and county are
not entitled to draw the*moneys now in
the treasury, in keeping with the provi
sions of the constitutional amendment rat
ified by the last Legislature, providing
for the payment of salaries due for No
vember and December of 1897. until -the
fiemand of the merchant creditors of the
School Department for $7000 advanced to
the teachers by them in 1898 Is satisfied.
The injunction restraining the teachers
frGm drawing this money was dissolved
by Judge Murasky last week and the mo
tion to appoint a. receiver has been de
nied by , the court. Yesterday morning
Mr. Powers requested further time In
which to again move against the teach
ers' fund, and the court gave him until
this afternoon to prepare his case. Â¦:> :>

Every year thousands of dollars are
paid out by the Catholic churches of this
archdiocese for, insurance against flre.~
The churches, schools, convents and all
the religious organizations carry insur

were all paid into the church a great
amount of money could be saved. The
money that would thus accumulate would
form the nucleus of a healthy insurance
fund, which in case of fire would furnish
ample means to build anew damaged prop-

but It Is said that the Archbishop Is se
riously considering the proposition.
