Now that Arch Rock is no more the old
salts of 1 the \ bay are telling what they
knew of it and its dangers. Here is a bit
of entertaining history told by Pilot
Frank Boyd:
. : The .blowing up of Arch . Rock repre
sents the labor "of of thirty-five men em
ployed steadily for ten months. Six drills
have been working for eight months, and
thf^a weeks ago the first explosive- was
placed in the tubes.
While no. definite knowledge can be had
whether or not the undertaking was a
success,' the contractors are sanguine that

shattered rock. This, according to Man
ager Axman, will, take all of ninety days.

taining many "thousand feet of timber.
erased. The explosion spread over a wide |
surface. There was no concentration, no
towering ? funnel of ' water, no long-dis
tance hurling of stones and timber. The"
work was accomplished . in workmanlike
fashion, and the spectacle suffered in con-:
sequence. When Shag , Rock was shat
tered to bits the water rose like a whirling
spout with a milky cloak. It took some
minutes to subside, and presented a sight
that was full 'of beauty. The emulsion of
sea water towered aloft and hung like a
grim, huge specter over the scene of de
struction. It remained long enough for
the sun to play upon it and produce glim
mering, scintillating light effects. There
was none of this yesterday. Broad . of
base and comparatively low in height the
cloud of water that was raised made a
speedy ascent and almost as quick a de
scent. It, was of momentary duration and
was over with before the spectators on
shore arid In boats realized Just what had
taken place. - Â¦
The blowing up of Arch Rock was a
success from the engineering viewpoint.
Spectacularly it was pretty mueh of a
failure. Thirty tons of gelatinâ the "nitro
glycerin explosive kindâ and two acres of
hard, impenetrable rock when brought
into conjunction, . and a terrible force ap
plied, naturally suggest a commotion of
some sort. But thirty tons of gelatin
placed as this was destroys like a deletive,
demoniac agency, without creating a fu
ror or a prolonged tempest in its. wake.
The rock and the wharf timber surround

The explosion which took Arch Rock
away from the sight of men had been
planned for many months. Two hundred
and sixty holes had been drilled Into the
resisting rock, and they were all filled
with the putty-like high explosive. The
touch of a button 4000 feet from the rock
Bet the destructive force in motion. Along
the cable the message of annihilation
Journeyed. Simultaneously -with the press
ing of this button the bomb burst. In
startling succession a - vast body of
water, churned into a filmy cloud, rose
upward, spreading itself over an area a
full half-mile in length and several hun
dred yards in depth. Like a heavy ice
berg In the distance, it floated on the
water and gradually melted into the sea.
Then the turmoil disappeared 0 and the
xelict of shattered piles, planks, dead fish
and a crust of yellowish foam told the
tale of artificial force against a natural
obstruction that will be seen no more.
tons . of gelatin did the trick.
With a low rumble and a sharp subse
quent explosion this landmark of the
northern , bay flew helter-skelter into
space. Timbers, rock and sea water beat
into a foam spread for a half-mile around
the one time Jutting rock. A small-sized
tidal wave was kicked up. Then all the dis
turbing elements subsided, and what was
left of the danger to Incoming ships had
sunk beneath the troubled waters or scat
tered itself on the flood tide, only to be
carried away by the current of the swift
ly moving stream.

"It is in its possible consequence that the

the eve of war with the United States.
Already the Cabinet at Washington has
announced that it has taken over the in

Already Mr. Hay has spoken of taking
energetic measures. Already the Amer

Game of Grab Says the Matin.
As to the casualty reports from the bat
tles said to have been fought in Tachlra,
on the Venezuelan border, he did not be

than did our whole Spanish-American

At the Venezuelan legation Senor Pull
do. Charge d'Affaires, expressed a firm
belief that there was no actual war be

said he would be immediately cabled if

LONDON, Aug. 15.â The waning session
of the House of Commons was enlivened
to-day by a vigorous tilt between Sir
William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal, and
Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secre
tary, over Lord Kitchener's proclamation.
Sir William characterized it as. "a mis
chievous document, the % inspiration of
neither Lord .Kitchener nor Lord Milner,
but of the Ministry of NataF." He de
clared the Government in arming the.na
tives was reverting to a practice which
had left the darkest stain in the history
of the war between England and America.
The new policy of the Government prom
ised to be neither creditable nor effective,
and. was in contravention | of all the fun
damental principles of the St. Petersburg
convention. The country would welcome
an ante-adjournment statement on the
status of the war, on which they were
still spending Â£5,000,000 a month, although
it was declared ended at the close of the
last session. - Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢ -
Chamberlain .said that the. war status
was clearly, indicated by Lord Kitchener's
weekly reports. He himself had gone out
of the prophesying business, but he as
sured the speaker that the Government's
attitude was the only method of ending
the war. The Colonial Secretary declared
that the use of native troops was no new
policy. It has been .pursued without ad
verse criticism. The Indian troops in Chi
na had been co-operating with the troops
of seven of the highest -.civilized powers.
Regarding the banishment of burghers,
Chamberlain said Great "Britain had a
"perfect right to enact what laws she
chose for , the government ' of a country
acquired by conquest. The /Boers must be
taught that they can no longer carry on
a guerrilla war at no personal risk while
Great Britain fed their women and chil
dren." - ' '
. He compared the conditions in South
Africa with those* in the Philippines, and
said the policy of America, as declared by
General MacArthur's" proclamation, would
certainly be the policy of Great Britain
if the campaign degenerated into a war of
banditti./ . . â¢- Â¦ -
. 'Regarding the devastation policy, Cham
berlain said it was | nothing . . compared
with General Sherman's campaign. He
had talked with General Sherman himself,
and Sherman justified his action on the
ground of humanity. â¢â¢; Â¦ ; . â¢ .
; Chamberlain | also said there waa no
foundation for the report that Lord Kitch
ener was coming home. â¢

LONDON, Aug. 15.â The House of Com-,
mons to-dajr, on the motion of John Red
mond, the Irish Nationalist leader, or
dered the editor and publisher of the
Globe, an evening paper of London (Con
servative), to appear at the bar of the
House to-morrow afternoon for gross
breach of privileges of the : House In ac
cusing the Nationalist members of- cor
ruption in connection with private bill leg
islation. The Globe editorial, to which
exception is taken, said: - Â¦
The same spirit and the same motives which
have made Tammany the synonym for polit
ical obloquy have made the Nationalist party
what it is. Many connected with It are the
very ruck of the population, whose sole ob
ject is to make as much money by political
Jobbery and corruption as they can. Any one
who has had connection with Irish private
bills, corporation contracts and franchises
across the water can bear, ample testimony to
this. â¢ , :
The Globe, hearing of Redmond's pro
posed action, attempted to explain that it
had not meant any imputation on mem
bers of the House of Commons, "but upon
the wire-pullers and parasites who have
made politics in Ireland a profession, as
their kinsmen have done in New. York." "
Redmond, in calling attention to this
"very degrading and scandalous libel,"
said the libel concerned the House of
Commons as a whole far more than the
Irish members. The latter had not com
plained of the violent, rancorous attack
of Chamberlain at Blenheim because they
knew him of old in connection with Irish
politics and his opinion was valueless.
But the charge of personal corruption was
a different matter, and the House ought
to vindicate its own honor. He moved
that the House declare the Globe's arti
cle'to be a gross breach of the privileges

That was in 1855. All the pilots had
'boarded off' and the schooner was com
ing in in charge of the boatkeeper.
There was a dense fog and the boat
keeper mistook Arch Rock for a sloop
under sail and getting his course accord
inglv made the mistake of his life. All
hands were saved, but the Sea Witch was
a total loss. . - Â¦
"The next wreck was that of the clip
per ship Flying Dragon in the winter of
1861-6?. She made the fastest run on rec
ord from Newcastle, N. - S. W.. thirty-five
days, and anchored oft Meiggs wharf.
Captain Watson, the well-known marine
surveyor, was in command of the vessel,
but the pilot was still in charge when the
accident happened. A sudden change of
wind and a fierce squall drove the Flying
Dragon down on the rock and she be
came a total loss.
"The next vessel lost on the rock was
the bark Autocrat In 1869. She was loaded
with coal and drifted down to her doom
in a dense fog. Since that time number
less vessels have made. the acquaintance
of Arch Rock and always to- their disad
vantage. The old ferry-boat Clinton went
on one of its ledges" In a fog and the
steamer Oregon, now running between the
Sound and Nome, lost her bilges on it.
The old bark Columbia stuck on It for* a
day and a night, and last of all. the bark
Ceylon drifted down on it a few months
ago and was saved by the quarantine
steamer Sternberg. As it was the Cey

In the old days it was a favorite amuse

to wait for a very low tide and then pull
a boat through under the arch. Captain
Frank Murphy, one of the best known of
the pilots, pulled a Whitehall through the
arch in 1857. Two of the crew of the pilot
boat Golden Gate pulled a yawl through
in 1859, and then a couple of years later a
couple of men tried to repeat the trick
but a heavy swell was rolling in through
the Golden Gate and they were crushed
against the top of the arch. Since that
time rowboata have kept away from Arch

Caribbean Sea. The' articles that San
Francisco imported to Colombia in. small
quantities last year were brooms, cordage,
cotton manufactures, drugs, salmon, flour,
fruit, machinery, hardware,- wire, malt
liquors, coal oil, paper, lard, butter,
brandy, whisky, soap, starch, sugar, veg
etables, wine and wood. The total im
ports into Panama during the year end
ing December 31, 1S99, since when no com
plete statistics are available, were from
all countries $1,555,665. The exports from
Panama to all Darts of the world in the
Fame period amounted to $1,061,100. De
tails of the imports Into Panama from
countries for the year 1899 are as follows:
From Great Britain, $535,795: from France.
S104.250; from Germany, $130,295; from Spain.
ti'j.oio: from the United States, $541,425; from
China and all other countries not named In
the foreeoing, $195,555.
Some commercial facts of interest rela
tive to Venezuela are gathered from a
variety of omclal sources. Last year 403
vessels arrived at Maracaibo which were
by nationalities as follows: American, 48;
British, 4; Norwegian, 15; German, 4;
Danish, 3; French, 1; Italian, 1; Russian,
1; Dutch. 30; Brazilian, 2: Colombian, 2.
In the year 1893 exports of merchandise
from Hamburg to Venezuela amounted to
$1,669,320. There has been quite a falling
off in the German trade in Venezuela In
the past few years as is indicated by sta
tistics showing the exports from Ham
burg to Venezuela in a series of recent
years as follows: 189S, $1,565,505; 1S97, $2,-
F.70.8SS: 1896, $3,175,908; 1895, $3,196,159; 1894,
$3,194,029.
In the year 1899 the exports of coffee
from Venezuela to the United States
amounted to $4,096,564 80. The exports
â¢from Venezuela to Hamburg in 1899 were
52,163,503. Five years before the exports to
Hamburg were three times as great, the
total being for 1834 the sum of $6,596,827.
The year 1S99 showed a lower total of ex

saved. The tugboat Velasco went down
to pass l'Outre, which is the eastern
mouth of the river, with two barges.
When last seen she had her decks awash,
and she is believed to have gone down.
If this boat and her barges have been
lost, twenty more people have been
drowned.
There are numerous reports of individ
ual casualties all along the river from
Buras down to the passes. All the steam
ers which started for the sea Tuesday re
mained inside the passes until Wednes
day evening and then went out safely,
among them being the Cromwell liner
Proteus and the British transport Mecha
nician, which was dynamited when in
port a few days ago. Not a single vessel
has passed the river since the storm be
gan, and fears are entertained for the
ones which are expected.
There is serious apprehension concern
ing the Cheniere, Caminada and Grand
Isle sections, on the South Louisiana
coast, west of the Mississippi River,
where 2C00 lives were lost in 1S93 by the
tidal wave. Up to this writing no word
has been received from that section,
which is largely inhabited by fishermen,
mostly Chinese and Malays.
Up to last midnight everything seemed
to be safe at the Mississippi coast towns
Bay *St. Louis. Pass Chrltian, Biloxl,
Mississippi City and Ocean Springs, but
since then not a Â¦word has been heard
from them. All wires are down, but no
great fear is entertained. The only re
ports of damage so far received are of
dastroyed bath houses and uprooted
trees. â¢

there are several washouts an the road
The New Orleans and Northeastern
road is also blocked by washouts, and
its big trestle over Lake Pontchartrain
has been shaken by the heavy sees break
ing against it.
Much damage has been done at Shell
Beach, a settlement on Lake Borgne,
which is southeast of the city, and con
nects with Lake Pontchartrain. All the
buildings there have been swept away,
and there are reports of loss of life among
the fishermen, but the extent of this is
not known. A tidal wave swept over the
land there as it did nine years ago. â¢
In the city of New Orleans and sub'urbs
there has been some damage. At Milne
burg, pne of the lake resorts, the railroad
pierhead, running out into the lake for
1000 yards, has been destroyed end all
light buildings demolished. The big build-
Ings on shore withstood the gale. There
was no loss of life. The steamer Neptune,
tied to this pierhead, pounded herself to
pieces and sank.
At West End the lake rushed over the
revetment and destroyed nearly all the
buildings there. The big dancing pavilion
at Lakeview was pounded to pieces by
wreckage washed by the waves.
The shell road to West End has been
under three feet of water, and Bucktown,
a gambling resort at the end of the re
vetment, has been swept away. It was
at the mouth of a canal, and^the sweep
of water into the canal from the lake
carried everything before it.
. The old basin canal, coming In the city
on Toulouse street, overflowed its bank,
inundating the entire second district. A
thousand men have been put to work on
it and are raising its banks.
A coal fleet of twenty-four barges be

Action Taken by Four Lodges of the
JOLIET, 111., Aug. 15.â The four lodges
of . the Amalgamated Association em
ployes of the Illinois Steel Company at
Joliet by,' unanimous vote decided to-night
to obey the strike order of President
Shaffer. The conference was in session
from 3 o'clock this afternoon until 9
o'clock to-night before the decision was
reached. â¢
The steel mills were closed at noon to
enable the members of the association to
attend the meeting, which was called i by
National Assistant Secretary Tighe, after
his arrival here this morning. He was ac
companied by Vice President Davis of the
Fourth district. Both men presented the
side of the association to the local mem
bers. It v.-as argued that in order to se
cure- the organization of non-union work
ers In the East it was essential that the
Western men should join the strike move
ment.
Tighe also appealed to the fealty of the
men to the association; he urged them to
be men and stand by their union. His
remarks were received with enthusiasm
and presaged the vote that followed. â¢â¢
This action will â¢ close the entire steel
plant here, throwing out of employment
nearly 3000 men. Kires will be drawn to
night.
The Joliet men had the same contract
with the Illinois Steel Company as the
South Chicago workers, who last night re
fused to listen to the arguments of Sec

BALTIMORE, Md., Aug. 15!â Three" ad
ditions to the United States navy were
christened and launched at the shipyards
of the Maryland Steel Company this af
ternoon. "They are torpedo-boat destroy
ers and will be known hereafter by the
names of Whipple, Ttuxton and Worden.
The ceremonies attendant upon the
launching took place at 2 o'clock in the
presence of a large assemblage of hand
some women and distinguished men, in
cluding Government, State and city offi
cials, officers in both army and. navy and
civilians of prominence. They came from
Washington, New York, Philadelphia and
from other points in the country on spe
cial trains and in private yachts, over a
thousand special invitations having been
issued and accepted.
When all was in readiness for the
launching Miss Isabelle Truxton of Nor
folk, Va., took her place at the bow of
the boat of that name; Miss Elsie Pope of
St. Paul, Minn., at the bow of the Whip
pie;, and Miss Millie B. Worden at the
bow of the Worden. Each held in her
hand a bottle of champagne, encased in
silver wire and having a handle of silver
upon one side of which was a shield sur
mounted by an American eagle, while on
the other was a plate upon which was
engraved the date, the name of the craft
and that of the lady holding it, to be re
tained by them as souvenirs. As each
boat in its turn slid from the ways into
the waters of the Patapsco, the bottles
were broken over the bows, the names
were spoke by the sponsors and the usual
cheering, handclapping and waving of
handkerchiefs and hat3 took place, ac
companied by the din of steam whistles
and factories in the vicinity.
The three new" boats are dissimilar In
name only. They arc the largest of their
type in the United States navy and they
are also among the largest in any navy
in the world. Their comparatively supe
rior size has enabled the designer to pro
vide Quarters for the officers and crew
which are far more commodious than on
other vessels of their type.

All the furnishings in the cabin 2are"

The new boats In length are 259 feet 6
inches over all, 247 feet on the water, 22
feet 5 inches beam, 14 feet 8 inches deep
and draw 9 feet of water with a nominal
displacement of 434 tons. They will be

they are expected to attain a speed of 30
knots an hour under natural draught.
They are supplied with two torpedo tubes
each and each boat will have eight rapid
fire guns, of which six will be 6-pounders
and the remainder 2-pounders.
The contracts for the vessels were let in

Garland May Be the Man.
Shaffer did not name the men whom he
charged with unwarranted interference
in the affairs of the organization, but for
mer President M. M. Garland is believed
to be one of the number.
Later in the day Michael Kelly, repre
senting- the Amalgamated Lodge of Mil
waukee, and Samuel Adams of the Joliet
Lodge were closeted with the advisory
board. They made an extended statement
as to the circumstances under Â¦which their
organizations failed to go out, and it is
said they promised that their men would
go on strike if permitted to give the three
months' notice provided for in their con
tracts. The local strike leaders are very
anxious to secure a reversal of the vote
by which the Western men remained at
work, and some of them seem confident
that something will be accomplished.
It is rumored that the United States
Steel Corporation is -negotiating for the
absorption of the Republic Iron and Steel
Company. There have, it is said, been a
number of conferences between prominent
stockholders in' the two companies, and it
is said that the terms of purchase have
been practically agreed upon. The Re
public plant is a large one, and its pur
chase would add greatly to the commer
cial strength of the steel corporation.
Strikers Asked to Attend.
Youngstown advices say that the of
ficials of the American Steel Hoop Com
pany have asked the strikers to attend a
meeting to-morrow at which. they propose
to lay before them the terms offered at
the manufacturers' and the strike leaders'
conference. The Amalgamated officials
are opposed to the meeting and will forbid
the men to attend it. /
President O. G. Powell, president of the
International Tin Workers' Protective As
sociation, was in conference with the
Amalgamated officials -to-day. It was
stated that they discussed the report that
the American Tin Plate Company was to
import black tin plates from Wales. Pres
ident Powell declined to talk when he left
the strike headquarters.
A dispatch from Sharon says:
The cotton planters of' the South are be
ginning to feel the effects of the steel strike,
according to advices received here. The clos
ing of the mills of the Steel Hoop Company
cuts off their main supply of cotton ties, and
they seem willing to pay any price in order to
have R sufficient supply when the time comes
to move cotton. The Steel Hoop Company's
largest mill, located at Youngstown, is idle,
and the workmen say they are determined not
to return to work.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 15.-Once more ef
forts are afoot to 6ettle the strike being
waged against the United States Steel
Corporation by the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers, but
their success is problematical. Neither
Bide Trfll admit that there has been a sin
gle step toward bringing about a rap
prochement or that there is any prospect
of an exchange of peace proposals. B. M.
Caldwell, formerly a mill owner of Mingo
Junction, Is known to have conferred with
the strike leaders with a view to sketch
ing a basis of settlement which he plans
to place before the officials of the steel
corporation. He Is believed to be the mys
terious man wno conferred with President
Shaffer for more than two hours at the
strike headquarters to-day, although the
latter said later he had not seen Caldwell
for months. Both sides vigorously denied
that they had either made overtures or
received proposals, but it is known, posi
tively that the plan Is under considera
tion. Caldwell Is acting independently,
and does not represent either the manu
facturers or the men. â¢ Â¦â¢
No expression from him was obtainable
and no line on the terms that have been
considered can be had. It is believed here
that under certain circumstances the con
tending sides could be brought together
and a settlement effected, but whether
such will come to pass remains to be seen.
Makes Significant Statement.
President Shaffer in a significant state
ment made at noon to-day said that per
sonally he was for peace, and that he" was
fighting only because he was on the de
fensive and forced to fight.
Meantime the contest between the two
great interests is being waged with vigor
and slightly varying fortunes. The steel
corporation seemed to be somewhat
stronger at the lower Union Mill of the
Carnegie Company in this city, although
the strikers are still working hard to
cripple or close it. The corporation also
added to the force at Wellsville, and an
nounced that at last it had the plant run
ning to its full capacity. It had been an
ticipated that the day would show some
move on the part of the American Tin
Plate Company toward opening one or
more of its plants with non-union men,
but nothing was done, and there were no
attempts at extensions in other direc
tions.
Three hundred men employed at the
seamless tube plant at McKeesport, an
auxiliary of the National Tube Company,
threw down their tools and joined the
strikers. It is said they quit because they
would not handle non-union made mate
rial. During the day the strikers kept a
close watch on the plants that are being
operated with non-union men and also
kept alert pickets around the Carnegie
plants and the works that are completely
closed down.
There were few developments, nnd ex
cept in the instances enumerated there
have been no changes in the general situ
ation. Good order was general through
out all the strike districts. President
Shaffer and his associates had a busy day
at strike headquarters. They were on
hand early, and -with a "dead line" that
kept the third floor of the BIssell block
clear of all intruders went into conference
with the man who is believed to be Cald
well. who has come â¢into the breach with
a peace plan.
President Shaffer did not appear until
shortly after noon, when he made a
statement to the newspaper men as fol
lows:
I will say officially the Amalgamated Asso
ciation has submitted no proposition to the
ettel corporation, nor has the steel corpora
tion offered any proposition to the Amalga
mated Association- We have not heard from
the corporation officially fclnce our last con
ference in' New TTork. I will say, however,
that certain men are interfering in this matter
and Interfering with our fight. They had bet

but now that we are forced into a ' fight and
called upon to defend Ourselves, w.e are fight

settlement and can assure you that no repre

lamps for illumination; lamps about the
deckhouse and hold and a storage battery
to operate the sparking apparatus on all
the engines.
Wood is the material to be used in the
boats because it deadens the noise of ma

them. Each vessel will be seventy-flve
feet long, twenty-three feet beam and will
draw about six feet of water. They are

We declare unalterable opposition to the

SAN JOSE,. Aug. 15.â The members of
the Prune Association will have a divi
dend without an order of the court. To
day the directors In session set aside $300,
000 to be apportioned immediately among
the, members of the association pro rata.
This makes a total of $1,484,000 that has
been paid the members on the 1300 crop.
The present prospects are the brightest
since the association was formed. Twen
ty-six cars of prunes were shipped to
day and the orders were scattered, show
ing that the demand for the prunes is
general. They were sold on the 314 cent
rate and the directors give it as their
opinion that there will be no trouble in
selling all now on hand at this price
before the time for delivery of the grow
ing crop. ,. â¢ ...
The money ordered apportioned comes
as the result of the large sales made
three weeks ago on the 3 cent basis. The
price of green prunes and fresh peaches
and -apricots is going up every day. The
directors have been able at this 1 session to
settle all vital differences between them
selves and the packers, so there will be
no delay in the movement of the prunes
on hand. Unsettled points of dispute re
main, but they are not such as affect the
sales and delivery of the fruit. This will
be good news to the growers as well as
the information of the dividend, for they
are sadly in need of money with which
to move the growing crop.

Young, 13 years old. The bullet, which
was fired from a 22-caliber parlor rifle,
was extracted by Dr. Maher at. the City

The rifle was the property of S. Mariani,

as a poultry yard. Vagrant cats, rats of

that his bullet had found, an unexpected

his baby victim to his home near by.

affected business all over the city. As a result the store is daily receiving large
shipments from our workshopsâ these goods are piled high on our counters |
We cannot keep ahead of the workshops if we sell these goods at their,
regular or intended pricesâ we will be overstocked and crowded for room.
To overcome these difficulties â to keep the aggregate of sales up â 'o keep
the store busyâto dispose of- these new goods,, we have reduced the prices
regardless of profits..
Suits, made up recently in our own workshops to sell at $i2.Â£o and $iÂ£.oo,
have been marked at $7.85. Overcoats, made to sell at $10.00, are reduced
to $6.45Â» Trousers worth #Â£00 are priced $1.85. This is all good, up-to-date
clothing, well made and fully guaranteed.
This sale is most opportuneâ comes at a time when a saving is appre-
ciated by the customer. He must - make .his dollars count. This is the store
where his dollars will do double duty.
If any customer does not think that the clothes are worth the former
-prices (regardless of the selling. prices) , he can have his money back instantly.
You can beiieve what we say .when we take the risk of your liking the clothes.

A comparison of the scores with which

in 1SP9 Miss Alice Moffltt won with g. score
of 122; Miss Caro Crockett's score last
year was 115, which this year was beaten
by Mrs. Brown, Miss Crockett and Mrs.
H. H. Sherwood and equaled by, Miss
Alice Hager. Some of the improvement
in the. scores may be due to pie course
and greens being in better condition, but
part at least may fairly be attributed to
the increased skill of the fair golfers. The
and Mrs. H. H. Sherwood with Miss Edith
McBean. Mrs. Brown made the first hole
in 3 on the first round, while Miss Hager's
drive landed in the bunker, from which
she played back, but the hole cost her 8.
Miss Hager not Infrequently drove a long
er ball than Mrs. Brown, but her play
through the ' green was not ! so accurate,
and she had some hard luck in getting
into places where her ball was almost un
playable In thick grass or bushes. Miss
Crockett's card showed three eights, while
Mrs. Brown's had recorded on it only two
sevens. At the conclusion of the contest
the handsome silver loving cup was filled
with sparkling" wine and presented to tho

A decidedly Interesting finish marked
the second race, a three-quarter-rnile
dash. McL-aughlin's bay gelding. Mike
Rice, Tullett up, with a. bracket to his
credit from Monday's performance, had a
narrow escape from defeat by Catherine
Bravo, Eddie Carey's mtire, but by hard
work Tullett saved the day, coming under
the wire half a head in front in 1:14. The
bookies played Mike -Rice even, asked 3 to
5 on Limber Jim, Hobart's chestnut, and
gave 2 to 1 on Catherine Bravo. Just be
fore the start the Limber one got down
to an even thing.
The third race, a three-furlong dash lor
previous non-winners, went to Eddie
Carey's chestnut gelding Corn Cake, a
three-year-old, with Logue up. carrying
105 pounds. The gelding was played by
-the books for a winner at 5 to 3, but the
populace by a large majority chose Has
kell's Bagdad, a 4 to 1 shot, which looked
to have an excellent chance to win.
The latter got a bad start, however, and
barely missed losing the place, Hobart's
Pilot coming in at a pace that would have
closed up the gap inside of six feet had
the wire been that much further off.
The fourth and last sprint of the day
was a mile dash with five entries. Around
the last turn it was a procession and the
finish was between "Whitman's Whaleback
and Latta's Pongo. the former a 2 to 1
and the latter a 3 to 1 shot. Whaleback
finished first in 1:43%, with Pongo a hot
second. L. S. Young's bay gelding Twink
ler, which sold as the favorite at odd3 of
3 to 2, took third money.
To-morrow is Santa Rosa day .and the
prospects are that the attendance will be
way ahead of anything so far noted.
The banks and principal stores will close
1 in honor of the event. To-day was the
first time in the history of the local track
when the "bang-tails" had things all to
themselves. Following are the summaries:
The first event of the day was a five
furlong handicap with five entries. D.
Dunn's Pegalong sold at even money in
the betting, with Burrough's mare, Dia
mond, at the same figure just before the
start. Alviso rode Pegalong and Mc-
Nlchols was astride the mare.
The position taken at the start was
maintained ' all the way in, Diamond fin
ishing first in 1:02, with George Richard
son's Grass, a bay gelding, as his op
ponent. Pegalong made a hard try for
the show, but was beaten by Rector'3
Peut Ktre after a hot drive down the
stretch.
SANTA ROSA. Aug. 15.-The attendance
at the race meet to-day was fully up to
that of yesterday and the betting was
lively. Preceding the regular card two of
the Santa Rosa trotting farm's horses
went an exhibition mile for new marks.

was comparatively clean.
The Valkyrie III was a wider and shal
lower craft than the Defender. The
Shamrock II Is a narrower boat than the
Constitution. The Constitution, while
lacking the graceful, curved lines of the
challenger, has power and strength that
may be found ..wanting In the Shamrock
II. Both should be pretty close In light
airs, expert yachtsmen believe, but when
heeling over to a commanding breeze the
Constitution, owing to her greater lateral
plane, should excel In a hard brush to
windward. In reaching or running there
may r.ot be such a pronounced difference,
they think. In- the absence of nny de
cisive figures they are inclined to be pru r
dent prophets, but that the challenger
must allow the defender about a minute
over a thirty-mile course seems pretty
well established.
As a sea jockey the yachting men here
abouts hold that Captain Sycamore Is
equal to Captain Barr. In a flying start,
to which he has been well broken In, he
might get the better of Captain Rhodes,
but as two minutes is allowed to cross
the line In the actual cup races this may
not prove an Important factor.
It Is said that there Is little doubt that
the Constitution will be chosen to defend
the cup. Although the honors are easy
up to date, each having scored the same
number of wins, still the Constitution is
reckoned as the better all around craft.

COLF CUP GOES
TO SAN RAFAEL
It would be hard to distinguish between
the Columbia and the challenger, so far
as their underbodies are concerned.
Their fins are practically alike. The
Shamrock II is a more graceful craft.
The beauty and cleanness of the run and
the sharpness of the forepart of the fin
are the principal points of the new
Shamrock. When the larger sail plan is
taken into consideration she must be ad
judged to be an opponent worthy to be
met. "With a foot less beam than, that
of the Columbia, and a larger sail plat,
she is an Ideal fine weather boat, well
adapted .to meet the usual run of early
the experts who saw her to-day. From
her easy entrance, forward to her close
run aft there is power and speed in every
line. All the curves are true and easy,
and there is nothing crude or coarse in
any of them. Mr. Watson evidently/took
the cutter .Britannia, his best all-round
boat, as the basis , of Ms model..-,In .im
proving on the. Britannia he evidently
had the. Columbia in his eye, for the mid
section of the Shamrock II is practically
that of the conqueror of the Shamrock I.
This fact was pointed out by experts As
showing how yacht designers on either
side of the Atlantic have been converging
along the same lines to such an extent
that, practically, they have come together,
and there are no marked differences In
types such as existed" in the day of the
Puritan-Genesta contest.
FOOTRACE TRICK
IS PLAYED ABAIN
A. finer, surface has never been seen on
a raclnfc yacht than that of the first
three strakes of the cup challenger after
the crew had finished the burnishing. The
general opinion of experts was that the
Shamrock II is a rare good boat, and
"Watson has avoided the errors he made
In the Thistle when he cut away her lat
eral plane so completely that she was of
Uttle use when hauled on a wind. Wat
son, they think, has also avoided those
crudities of form which are characteristic
of the Valkyrie III and which were nearly
as-pronounced on the Shamrock I. Evi
dently the Glasgow designer haa benefited
by close studies of the epoch-making
yacht Gloriana, designed by Nat Herres
hoff. and also from the later productions
of that wizard's brain, the Vigilant, De
fender and Columbia, for an expert can
see traces of all these craft in Sir Thomas

growth and but- a solitary barnacle.

that not a plate was injured.

plete shutout. In the fourth "Dyke" hit
a simple one to the Los Angeles twirler,
who was successful in throwing It over
Hutchinson's head and far into the
bleachers, Xordyke completing the circuit
before the ball was returned. After that
the Wasps did not have a chance to win.
The Angela owe their overwhelming !vlc
tory to Hartwell's excellent work in the
box and Hutchinson's lucky drive over
the center field fence when two men'were
on bases. Up to this time the score stood
2 to 1 in their favor, and not another tally
was made after this remarkable hit. Iburg
seemed to settle down when the ilrst lira
was over and but one more safe hit was
made off his delivery. .
Los Angeles sent a man home in the lni T
tial inning. Atherton hit, as did C. Reilly
and Bowman. Bowman's drive brought
Atherton home, but Reilly was caught at
the platg by Brockhoff's beautiful throw
from the center garden. . The next man
went out quickly, the red legs scoring
no more points until Hutchinson did his
clever stunt in the fifth. In this round
the orange growers cinched the game and
blighted all of Uncle Henry's fondest
hopes. Hartwell took a walk to first, went
to second on Reitz's hit and scored. on
Kelly's two-bagger to deep left. It was
up to Hutchinson to say something, and
he was not found wanting, for he placed
the sphere on the other side of the right
field fence, sending Reitr and Kelly in
ahead of him. This was all that the An
gels could do in the way of making runs,
but it was enough to give th<?m the vic
tory.
The Germans took another slide down
the toboggan yesterday afternoon and
Mr. Morley, with his bunch of left-handed
swatters, walked, off the field of battle
with smiles of satisfaction,' for the hour
and fifteen minutes which they had la
bored netted them five runs, while the
men who _ sport- : the black and yellow
could do no better than send one over 'the
route, and but for Hartwell's wild throw
they would have been whitewashed.

Each trotter pulled a twenty-nine-pound
euJky. The stallion wore a side check,
two-minute harness, without breaching
or breast collar, and was protected to tie
knees and hocks with white felt boots
The Abbot carried the old-style harness,
an overdraw check, and was rigged with
knee and quarter boots forward and with
tee boots behind.
The betting before the race was $100 to
$30 on Cresceus and it was lively, there
being many followers of The Abbot and
of his driver, Geers. who were willing to
take the short end. Summary of races:
2:20 trot, purse $2000â Neva Simmons won the
first, second and fifth heats in 2:13>Â£. 2:11U

To the credit of The Abbot it should be
said that not only was this his first race,
but he has also been sick, and his best
mile since his recoverv was In the vicin
ity of 2:09.
Cresceus Favorite in the Betting.
Each was driven up and down the
stretch for a warming tip, and when they
reached the starter Cresceus was slightly
In the teajj and they were called back.
The next time down, however, they were
nose and nose. Thtn Cresceus rushed to
the front and had a lead of a length,
which he held to the quarter, making that
mark In ::!0%. This lead The "Abbot had
slightly reduced at the half, which was
reached in -1:01V*. and he was a very close
second at the three-quarters pole in 1:32*4.
The vast crowd realized that a world's
record was about to be made, and the
grand stand arose to its feet while the
multitude which was in the space between
the stand and the track cheered wildly.
Comir-gr down the stretch it was a battle
royal, with The Abbot verv close up, but
Cresceus. with his bulldog grip, kept on
with nostrils extended and just managed
to beat his opponent by half a length in
2:03>4, the world's trotting ; record in a
race. To say that the announcement cre
ated tumultuous appTause only half con
veys the meaning M the expression.
The Abbot Breaks* Disastrously.
A little over half liour had expired
when the two ground lior.s'es came out for
the second trlaltpid' were started under
the same eonditionAthet 'existed in the
first heat. They \7eiR? away beauti
fully, but The Abbot had not traveled a
hundred yards before he made a disas
trous break, and before he could recover
his gait Cresceus ' was in front. The Ab
bot, once settled, made a grand effort to
overtake his opponent, but the son of
Robert McGregor was out for victory and
kept on, passing the .quarter in :31%, the
half In 1:024, the three-quarters in 1:35
and came rushing home the last quarter
in :31>i. doing the mile In 2:06Â»4. with
The Abbot back of the flag. As the race
was best three in live Ketcham consented
that Cresceus go another heat. This he
did shortly before 5 o'clock, accompanied
by a runner for the first half, where he
was joined by another runner, and he did
the mile in 2:05. the quarter in :304, the
half in* 1:011.2 and the three-quarters in
It was about 3:30 o'clock when the driv
ers, Ketcham and Geers. appeared before
the grand stand and obtained their posi
tions for a start by the flip of a coin.
Luck was with the driver of Cresceus, as
he secured the pole, a decided advantage
when two horses so nearly equal In point
of record are considered. When a little
later the horses came from the paddock
they were wildly cheered, and they looked
lit for the work before them. Fortunately,
too, the wind had died down to a dead
calm, so there was no obstacle in that
line.
Cresceus Secures the Pole.
XEW'TORK, Aug. IS.â The trotting In
terests of the Empire City have not re
ceived such a Loom In a quarter of a cen
tury as was developed to-day at the
Brighton Beach track, when, under the
auspices of thÂ«5 New York Trotting Asso
ciation the champion Btallion and the
champion gelding, Cresceus and The Ab
bot, came together for a purse of $12,000.
The Abbot, -with his record of 2:03}i of
last season, and Cresceus with his mark
of 2:0214, made at Columbus recently, were
to decide the question of which was the
one to g-o down In. history as the fastest
trotting horse now living. A larger crowd
was present than was ever before seen on
a New York trotting track. The grand
stand was simply packed, and this despite
the fact that reserved seats with admis
sion cost ?4, while bo.\Â»p holding four per
sons were all disposed of at 530 each in
addition to the regular admission. While
the seating capacity is but 2300, it was
undoubtedly a tact that close to 5000 peo
ple were jammed Into the structure.
Every available space between the stand
and track was packed to its utmost oa
pacity, and the paddock, infleld and
cheaper admission field contained a legion
of people. It is estimated that fully 15,-
O00 people were present. The weather was
simply perfect for the great trial and the
track was like velvet, though probably a
second slow. Several times during the aft
ernoon both horses put in some prelim
inary work, and each time they passed
the crowd there was great enthusiasm.

study the lines of. the craft Sir
Thomas Upton has sent over in his sec
ond attempt to lift the: America's cup.
The challenger resembles the Columbia
very much, so far as her underbody and
fin are concerned. 'That the Shamrock II
is a dangerous opponent was conceded' by
NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â The Sham

early to-day and j American ex

autumn breezes off Sandy Hook. How
ever, that the America's cup is in peril
of being "lifted" by Sir Thomas Upton
this year is by no means the opinion of
conservative yachtsmen /who looked upon
the Shamrock II to-day. That she has
intrinsic merit and will doubtless be hard
to beat/was admitted, Â¦ but everything
about her hull that Â¦ is meritorious has
been gathered from American sources.
A careful examination of the challenger
showed that she had suffered no strain

"The rumors of such a deal have -been
floating ' around the street for the last
thirty or forty days," said Mr. Hellman.
"What they, amount to I cannot say. In
fact, I know nothing about the matter ex
cept that for the last month there have
been no negotiations, nor has anything at
all been done which might be construed
into a determination. on the part of the
present owners of the property to transfer
It to the hands of an Eastern syndicate."
This Â¦ statement of Mr. Hellman is open
to two constructions^ â either the sale took
place more than a month ago. , which is
not a fact, or it may take place ln the
near future, which is very likely.
When seen yesterday and questioned
concerning the proposed transaction
young Mr. Hellman of the TJnion**Trust
Company, who as the confidential man
of his father is in a position to know what
is going on in the company ln which his
sire controls the major portion of the
stock, would say nothing. beyond affirming
that nothing had occurred in the matter
for the last thirty days.
Who the prospective purchasers are v Is
not' known to an absolute certainty, but
the finger of gossip points to a Baltimore
company, with J. T. Blackwell and G. R.
Webb, capitalists of that city, at its head.
From other sources come the tale of one
W. J. Payne of the Newport News and
Old Point Comfort roads of Virginia be
ing mixed up in the deal, but whether this
last named gentleman is acting independ
ently for his own people or in conjunction
with the representatives of the Baltimore
syndicate Is not .quite clear. Â¦â¢
That there is a deal on between an East
ern syndicate and the Market-street Rail
way people which has for its object the
purchase . of the railway property by the
syndicate there is little doubt. It is doubt
ful, though, whether the negotiations
have progressed much farther than they
were a month and more ago, when the
rumors concerning the proposed transac
tion first began to stir the local business
world and influence the local stock board.

At the meeting with the attorney of the
Employers' Association yesterday after
noon Mr. Greensfelder said that he had
been informed by Attorney Michael that
the Employers' Association would stand
firm by the letter of August 2, and that
they considered that the settlement of the
strike had gone out of their hands. Mr
Michael asserted that the association rec
ognized the right which employes have to
unionize, but declared that the employers
must settle -the differences with each in
dividual employe. . ,
The Municipal League through its presi
dent, N. B. Greensfelder, made another
attempt yesterday to induce the Employ
ers' Â¦ Association to come ' to terms with
their striking employes, but without suc
cess. In fact, Ihelr appeal met with a flat
rebuff. Attorney Michael not only refused
to consider their proposals, but requested
that no further negotiations or mediations
be offered. Â¦

If the reported resignation of Mr. Hays
Is officially confirmed it is by no means
certain that H. E. Huntington will be hl3
successor. If Mr. Huntlngton has any
such ambition it Is in direct contradiction
to his own utterances, as he has time and
again stated that the presidency of the
road was about the last thing he desired.
That Mr. Hays is more or less dissatis
fied with his place, that he resents
the curtailment of his powers and that
these powers have been very materially
curtailed. Is nothing new. All this was
published in The Call a month ago, and
the columns that are now being written
on these subjects are merely repetitions
of what has already been published In
this paper. The Call was the first paper
in the city to announce the changes that
were taking place in the big yellow build
ing and to call attention to the manner in
which the powers of the president were
being restricted. At that time The Call
prophesied that these disagreements prob
ably would result in a general upheaval,
and if Mr. Hays has actually resigned
his action in so doing is nothlnjr more
than the fulfillment of that prophecy.
Whether Mr. Hay3 has resigned or
whether he has not. it Is probable that
several changes will take place among the
officials of the Southern Pacific in the
near future, and the certainty that talk
ing will tend to increase rather than
diminish the number of these changes is
very effectual ln keeping the mouths of
those who are ln a, Dosition to get inside
information firmly closed.
In the meantime rumors of all sorts are
flying thick and fast about the big yellow
building, but none of them are founded
on anything more substantial than more
or less clever guesswork. There are only
one or two men at this end of the lino
sufficiently in the confidence of Mr. Hays
to know positively whether or not he has
resigned, and these men are In positions
where the best thing they can do Is to
saw wood and say nothing.
Charles M. Haya of the Southern Pa
cific continues to maintain absolute se
crecy concerning his reported resignation
from the presidency of the Southern Pa
cific. Mr. Hays will neither affirm nor
deny the truth of the rumor. He said
yesterday. that it had been a rule of his
throughout his "entire career never to dis
cuss his personal concerns for publica
tion, and he saw no reason for departing
from this rule in the present instance.
With many men such a non-committal
attitude might be taken as an evidence
of their unwillingness to admit the truth
of that which they knew to be so. Mr.
Hays, however, is not an ordinary man.
and his uncommunicativeness means ab
solutely nothing one way or the other.
Phillips when seen to-day made an ef
fort to appear composed, but it was evi
dent that he deeply felt the final step in
the disentanglement . of his affairs which
had been forced upon him through the ac
tion of three of his company's creditors
By his own statement, the company is in
solvent. The liabilities are placed at about
$200,000, with assets taken at their face
value amounting to $225,000 or $250,000 Of
this he believes that $100,000 is in worth
less accounts; that the company will fall
short approximately $100,000 in the settle
ment. This Phillips declares he will make
up to the creditors to the last cent. He
says he has lost or given up all of his
money and real estate, but that, accept
ing offers of financial assistance, .he will
resume business individually. Voluntarily
he proposes to give for the benefit of the
creditors every dollar of profit he makes
ln his transactions over and above $2500
a year, which he will keep for himself and
family.
The two directors of the company who
joined with Phillips in consenting to filing
the petition are C. B. Moore and W. K.
Sackett. The remaining director is John
P. Collis. W. K. Sackett has been placed
in charge of the affairs of the company
as receiver and will assume his duties to
morrow.
Since the middle of July, when the tan
gled condition of the books of the com
pany, was discovered, every effort had
been made to straighten out Its affairs.
Expert accountants have' overhauled the
books and have in some degree broughTt
order out of chaos. It Is estimated that
the assets of the company will aggregate
$250,000, and the liabilities will not exceed
?2oo,ooo. ;
The three creditors who signed' the peti
tion are J. A. Greenlee, H. F. Babbett and
W. R. Hutchins. The claims of these gen
tlemen range from $5000 to $25,000. Mean
while the statement Is nearly complete
and the exact condition of the company's
finances will, soon be known.
The filing of the petition and the ap
pointment of a receiver will enable the
company to continue m business. -
CHICAGO, Aug. 15.-On the petition of
three creditors of the George H. Phillips
Company a petition in bankruptcy has
been filed for the company ln the United
States District Court. George H. Phillips
and two other directors of the company
filed their consent that the petition be al
lowed, and the Chicago Title and Trust
Company has been appointed temporary
receiver.
There are two new priests in this city.
Rev. Father Cantlllon and Rev. W. Col
lins, lately of Brighton, Mass., arrived
here a few '- days ago and will take up
residence. Father Cantillon is a brother
of the assistant priest of Sacred Heart
parish. One of the newcomers will be as
signed to the Holy Redeemer parish to
assist Rev. Father McQuaide.
Throughout the day St. Ignatius Church
was crowded with devout worshipers. The
masses celebrated in the morning were
well attended. At the 10:30 mass many
could not find seats. The Rev. Richard
Bell was celebrant of the mass and he
was assisted by the Rev. Father Bealer,
deacon; the Rev. Father Buckley, sub
deacon, and Edward Foley, master of
ceremonies. Arthur Coglan and Ray Wil
son were the acolytes. " â¢
In the evening the services were very
solemn. Benediction â¢was given after ves
pers.
His Grace Archbishop Riordan partici
pated in the solemn high mass celebrated
at St. Mary's Cathedral at 10:30 o'clock
yesterday morning. He was attired ln full
Pontificals and delivered the Papal bless
ing. Rev. Father Prendergast, vicar gen
eral of the diocese, was celebrant of the
mass; Rev. Charles Ramm, deacon: Rev.
John B. Hannlgan, sub-deacon, and Rev.
Father E. P. Dempsey, master of cere
monies. At the ' conclusion of the mass
the Papal blessing was given by the Arch
bishop. This blessing is given but four
times a yearâ on Easter, Christmas, Pen
tecost and Assumption.
The altars of all the churches were
beautifully decorated and special music
was rendered at the solemn high mass.
Early masses, as on Sunday, were cele
brated in every Catholic church in this
city yesterday in honor of the Feast of
Assumption. This feast is in honor of
the death of the Blessed Virgin Mother.
It is a belief In the church that the Bless
ed Virgin's body was assumed into heav
en, and this belief is based on the fact
that no relics of the Virgin could be found
after her demise. A special day is set
aside, therefore, in memory of the As
sumption. Yesterday being the fixed day
of obligation, all Catholics attended mass
as on Sunday.
"It is not true. The employers need no
assistance or counsel in this matter. They
propose to settle affairs with their em
ployes without interference from any
body. They will recognize no one not di
rectly Identified- with the employers and
those they employ. They have denned
their position, and they will not recede
therefrom under any circumstances."
"Is it true that President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler of the State University has been
called upon as a sort of arbitrator of the
differences between the employers and the
strikers?"
"Such a committee is unnecessary. The
association has said what It will do In the
premises, and there will be no swerving
from that course." . ..
"Do you think a committee will be ap
pointed to confer with the committee of
one hundred?"
"We received the letter from the com
mittee of one hundred, but the matter
was not considered by the association. I
have sent no reply to Attorney Rothschild,
and from present appearances it is proba
ble there will be no reply."
Although the letter was delivered in
person to Attorney Michael of the asso
ciation on Wednesday evening, that gen
tleman placed it on file without' comment.
Several members of the association were
informed of the request contained ln the
missive, but the matter was not evidently
deemed of sufficient importance to cause
a special meeting of the association to be
held. When asked to state what action
the association would take relative to the
matter Attorney Michael said:
The committee of one hundred of the
Federation of Improvement Clubs waited
in vain yesterday for a reply to Its letter
to the Employers' Association requesting
that body to appoint a committee of eight
to confer with a like committee of the
federation with a view to effecting a set
tlement of the strike. Â¦
Employers, Do Not Consider Improve-
ment Clubs' Plan.
The suggestion was favorably consid
ered. President Cluff said such a commit
tee would be appointed and that the mem
bers thereof would do all in their power
to effect a settlement of the strike
President Alpers of the Retail Grocers'
Association thereupon appointed a com
mittee to co-operate with the committee
to be appointed by President Cluff This
committee consists of George Alpers
chairman; Eugene McCoy, J. M Sullivan'
J. Salomon and P. A. Buckley '
A report was circulated after the meet
ing that the wholesalers had given in
structions to the retailers to refuse credit
to any of the strikers, the penalty of re
fusal being the positive declination of the
wholesalers to supply the retailers with
goods during the strike. When asked if
the report was true President Alpers of
the Retailers' Association said last niirhf
"The report is false in every particular'
The matter of shutting on! the credit of
strikers by the retailers was not even
broached at to-day's conference. No such
action will, in my opinion, ever be taken
The strike is injuring the retail trade
greatly, but if the trouble.is soon settled
things will be working smoothly 'within
a short time. We believe that the influ
ence of the wholesalers in trying to brlntr
about this result will be felt and recop
nized by the members of the Employers'
Association." . "
The question as to the action that
should be taken in the premises formed
the subject of prolonged debate. The an
nouncement by the Employers' Associa
tion that they would not recognize in
dividuals or organizations not directly
concerned in the strike was regarded as
an intimation that even the wholesalers
themselves would not be recognized
J. Salomon, a retailer, argued that both
sides should grant concessions. The em
ployers, he thought, were unnecessarily
firm at a time when a little diplomacy
might be exercised to advantage. While
he did not believe both parties to the con
troversy were In the right he did believe
that both could concede privileges to aÂ«l-
v u nt ?/l* He des i r e<i that a committee
should be appointed by the wholesalers to
wait upon the employers with a view to
securing the promise of that body to re
consider its previous action in refusing to
recognize the unions.
The Retail Grocers' Association was rep
resented by George Alpers, president of
that organization, Eugene McCoy, vice
president, and J, M. Sullivan, secretary.
The general condition of trade ln conse
quence, of the controversy between the
employers and employes was discussed
pro and con. It was represented that the
retail grocers had lost from 25 to 40 per
cent of their business in consequence of
the strike and that the percentage of loss
was increasing daily. Inasmuch as the re
tailers are Innocent parties to the contro
versy they demanded that the wholesalers
take some step to effect peace between
the warring factions.
A conference of the members of the
"Wholesale and Retail Grocers' associa
tions was held at 123 California street yes
terday afternoon for the purpose of con
sidering ways and means to bring the
strike to an end. There were some thirty
business men ln attendance and William
Cluff, president of the Wholesale Grocers*
Association, was in the chair.

Their Injuries were slight, consisting prin

CHOPS CANNOT BE MOVED.
The steamer "Wellington, with 2500 tons
of coal, docked at James P. Taylor's
bunkers to-day. Taylor failed yesterday
to get permission from the Longshore
men's Union in San Francisco to dis
charge the cargo. The coal teamsters
have threatened to strike if he shall put
a non-union gang at work. Taylor eays
he is going to try to unload the steamer
as his bunkers arc empty and retailers
have had no suppMes for ten days.
Building contractors Â¦who have sublet
contracts to master painters that have
been marked as "unfair" will have to re
scind such sub-contracts or suffer a walk
out of all union workmen in their employ.
Such is the order which has been issued
by the Building Trades Council. This is
the first move by the council in its fight
to assist the journeymen painters in their
strike.
OAKLAND. Aug. 15.â Because of the
strike in San Francisco the Southern P.v
ciflc Company has notified Its station
agents along its lines in Alameda County
that no cars will be furnished for hay
shipments until further notice. There are
thousands of tons of hay in the fields that
cannot be moved. Tremendous losses
threaten the farmers as warehouse facil
ities are inadequate. At Altamont 6000
tons of hay are in the fields. There is no
warehouse there.
In the orchard sections the growers are
as seriously affected. They are naulins
as much as the canneries can handle, but
in many instances the orchardists have
sold to San Francisco canners, who are
unable to handle the shipments. As all
contracts have a "strike" clause the pro
ducer suffers.
Great Losses.
Alameda County Farmers Will Suffer
Pickets Complain of Police.
Pickets for the strikers reported at
headQuarters yesterday that on "Wednes
day night policemen in longshoremen's
dress were patrolling in the vicinity of
Jackson-street wharf. They allege that
pickets were stopped by them, searched
for arms, roughly treated and compelled
to move on. They claim that when they
had been driven away a wagon drove up
with a half-dozen negroes, who were
rushed aboard one of the vessels lying
there.
"Wherea.8, In view of the present disturbed re
lations existing between the Employers' Asso
ciation and their employes, we, the members
of the Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs, have
Resolved." That the action taken by the Police
Commission In appointing a large number of
irresponsible and inexperienced men to exercise
the duties appertaining to the enforcement of
police regulations is In our, Judgment Injudi
cious and a menace to the peace, security and
order Â¦which should be maintained by the consti
tuted authorities. We desire to direct attention
to the fact that men employed as police officers
paid by private contribution will serve the con
tributor and cannot perform police duty im
partially. In our opinion the Police Commission
should draw uoon the urgent necessity fund,
Â¦when necessary, to employ such additional po
licemen, who should be solely under the control
of the ' constituted authorities, and thereby be
required to perform impartially this high and
Important duty.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs adopted the following resolution
at its meeting last night:
pointment of Special Officers.
Improvement Clubs Condemn Ap-
MENACE TO PEACE.
Messages were received from local
teamster organizations In various parts
of the United States promising the strik
ers abundant finacial support.
Father Yorke asserted that the strikers
were undeniably in the right, and de
clared that it was not only proper for
them to hold out, but that it was their
sacred duty to do so. In advising the
strikers to continue their fight for the
principles of unionism he stated that the
strikers had the sympathy and moral sup
port of the people at large.
The Rev. Father Peter C. Torke was
present by invitation at the regular week
ly meeting of the Brotherhood of Team
sters held last night at 117 Turk street
and addressed the members on the strike
situation. He commenced with the causes
which led the employers to lock their men
out and traced the course of the trouble
down to the present time. In conclusion
the speaker dwelt on the possibility of an
adjustment. Throughout his address
Father Yorke complimented the men upon
tKe stand which they had taken and en
couraged them to remain true to their
cause, Â¦which he declared involved the
very dearest rights of manâ namely, self
respect and personal independence.
main Firm.
Father Yorke Advises Strikers to Be-
TEAMSTERS HOLD MEETING.
&-^|->a HE developments of yesterday
1 1 seem to have Increased the diffl
j j culties In the way of a speedy set-
Ji tlement of tho labor controversy
rather than to have diminished
them, and employers and strikers alike
expressed the conviction that conciliation
was no longer possible.
The one rift in the cloud is the move
ment among retail merchants. The small
dealers are taking up the question in
earnest and the movement is gaining
strength daily. Their possible influence
pives rise to tho only hope of conciliation
that is entertained now.
The Employers' Association failed to
xr.ake any response to the Municipal Fed
eration of Improvement Clubs' communi
cation asking that a committee of five bo
appointed to confer with a similar com
mittee from the strikers and committees
from the bodies that are moving for con
ciliation. Moreover, Attorney Michael
caid that probably the request would not
even be considered.
The Municipal League renewed its ef
forts to bring employers and labor leaders
to a"n agreement upon terms of peace, and
Its representative was told by Mr. Michael
that he might just as well discontinue his
efforts.
Mr. Michael stated yesterday the posi
tion of the Employers' Association as
follows:
"The employers need no assistance or
counsel in this matter. They propose to
fettle affairs with their employes without
Interference from anybody. They have
denned their position and they will not
recede therefrom under any, circum
stances."
Michael Casey, president of the City
Front Federation, said there seemed no
hope left of an early settlement.
'"It looks as If tight is the only thing
left." he said, "and if they must have
fight we will proceed to give it to them in
earnest."
Andrew Fcruseih. secretary of the Sail
ors' Union, said there could be no settle
ment until the Employers' Association
phould consent to consider the terms of
ppace repeatedly submitted by the strik
ers.
"Then you will not submit any further
proposals for settlement?" he was asked.
I will not make it so strong as that,
but it is altogether improbable that we
will," was Mr. F'uruseth's reply.
AL0XG THE WATER FEONT.
Slips Go to Sea With Heavy Cargoes
and Others Arrive.
The steamers Pomona for Eureka, Sa
moa for Hardy Creek and George Loomis
for Ventura and the schooners Monterey
and Mary C for Coos Bay and Bodega
managed to get to sea yesterday. They
all carried heavy cargoes.
The Santa Rosa arrived from San Diego
yesterday afternoon. She carried a large
number of passengers and a large cargo
of general merchandise. The Gipsy got
in from Monterey with a load of bark,
and the brig Galilee arrived from Honoipu
with a load of sugar and hides. The Ger
man ship Erato, in ballast, got in from
lquique.
The Kosmos liner Anubis was taken
Into the stream yesterday afternoon. To
day the South Portland will be moored
along one side of the vessel and the steam
echooner National City will be moored
on the other and the work of loading her
with coal and railroad ties will be com
menced. It is expected that the Anubis
will be ready to sail to-night.
The Peru will not be able to get away
until Saturday. She was scheduled to sail
to-day, but her owners were unable to get
help enough to handle the cargo waybilled
to her.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
will start in to-day to load the steamer
Colon. She has been used as a boarding
house for the non-union men engaged in
handling the freight on the Mail dock
since the inception of the strike. The
company will bring the San Bias down,
from Martinez and turn her into a "bunk
house" to replace the Colon.
The captains of the vessels owned by
the Pollard Steamship Company started
in yesterday morning to unload the Coro
nado at section B of the seawalL The
Coronado is loaded with lumber.
There was no change yesterday In the
conditions surrounding 1 the unloading of
the colliers anchored In the bay and
moored at the various bunkers. The men
work steadily and get out enough coal to
make a Ehowtng, but the quantity taken
out of the vessels is not large enough to
supply the demands made by the retailers.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
will endeavor to get the Bonita ready for
eea by Saturday. Since the commence
ment of the strike the Bonita has been
laid up and no attempt has been made to
get her away for a trip to the way ports
Fouth. The company officials claim that
they have all the help they need at pres
ent and will be able to g-et her ready for
her regular trips.
Only two people -were treated at the
Harbor Emergency Hospital yesterday
Â¦whose Injuries vrere due to the strikers.
They were William Tait of 32 Tehama
street and J. O'Leary of â¬25 I>avls street.

THE COLD SHOULDER-H. D. A..
Sonora, Cal. This correspondent writes:
"Would it be a gross breach of etiquette
for a lady to salute, shake hands with a
number of lady guests, with many apolo
gies; then turn, .facing her affianced, and
with a formal bow say 'excuse me,' and
then go driving with her brother in the
same direction and over the same road
she had declined to ride with the cne she
is engaged to? Then again If at the next
meeting, in the presence of relatives and
friends, she should, when asked by her
affianced for an evening, say only 'I will
see you again,' and offer no explanations,
would that be sufficient to break off the
engagement?" This department does not
care to give advice in love affairs, in the
c&se mentioned it is possible that the lady
is testing the temper of her affianced, or
she may be giving him the cold shoulder.
In either case the affianced should meet
the lady arid have . an explanation. ' Her
conduct certainly warrants him in asking
for one. ;

The fourteenth and fifteenth' amendments to the
constitution, says the Senator, have no more to do
with the issue than any other part of the organic law.
The grandfather clause is false to every principle of
our politics. Moreover, every step taken toward es

Warming to this phase of his subject he says: "The

inheritance from fathei to son would destroy all dis

the system that the American Revolution abolished.
The steps would be few and would be rapidly taken to
the complete restoration of monarchy so soon as; we

first step that tells with fatal and irrevocable effect.
The argument is irresistible that offices should follow

of inheritance; and this is all' that is meant in the
In an open letter Senator Morgan declares the
American Revolution was not so much a battle for
a redress of grievances as it was a struggle to abol

upon the principle that the right to share in govern

gated, nor transmitted by inheritance nor by will to
any other person," and he asserts that "to make blood

father to son is to uproot from its foundations the

SENATOR MORGAN of Alabama has long been
regarded in the Senate and out of it as the
ablest representative of the Bourbonism that
for so long a time has dominated Southern politics
and Southern society. He has never held liberal views
on any subject, and upon the question of negro suf
frage has been an extreme reactionist. Nevertheless,
he has found the action of the Alabama constitutional
convention in suppressing negro suffrage in that State
too reactionary for him. Early in the proceedings
of. the convention he uttered his protest against the
proposed scheme of introducing into the constitution
"a grandfather clause," as it is called. He had no
objection to- depriving the negro of his vote while
leaving the ballot in the hands of illiterate whites, but
he did object to that method of doing it.

COIN OF SARDINIAâ H. T.. Niles, Cal.
The coin described is a five-lire piece
issued during the reign of Carlos Felix,
1821-31. A firm in New York charges for
such a coin from $2 to $2 50.
It is expected that Bishop Moore's report to his
church will make a sensation throughout Christen
dom, and will be more than the mere sensation of
a day. It will sting the civilized conscience into
demanding that the Governments of Christendom
infuse justice and fairness into their relations with
China. For the good of what we boast as our civili
zation nothing more desirable and useful can be done.
It has been long apparent that what is called, the
"missionary spirit" in its dealings with China has
been governed by anything but justice and Christian
ethics, and the Western powers have taken their
cue from its savage aggressions. A change will
benefit the Occident more than the Orient. "
The latest testimony in that direction is by the
Methodist Bishop, David H. Moore of Frankfort,
Ind. He is in China ss a representative of the Meth
odist church to study the causes that led up to the
Boxer outbreak. He has traveled 5000 miles in the
Chinese empire and made an exhaustive study of the
conditions which preceded the disturbance. In a
letter which foreshadows his report he defends China
in the most forcible language. After stating in de
tail the infamous treatment to which the Western
powers subjected that country for sixty years, he
says: "Great wrongs the Chinese have committed,
but with a tenth part of the provocation we would
have done a thousand times more and greater."
We have heretofore shown that the disturbing
presence of missionaries, outside the treaty ports,
lests upon an infamous forgery in the French treaty
of i860, the criminal act of a Christian missionary,
and we have approved every expression from respon
sible authorities of different branches of. the Chris
tian church that did justice to the Chinese and re
buked the chicanery of the Western powers.
NOW that the world's suspicion is being set on
edge by rumors of a recrudescence of anti
foreign violence in China, it is a good time to
consider the subject of making China behave like
other nations by treating her as they treat each
other.

-The burghers have already proven the truth of
Kruger's statement that they, could not be cpn
quered except at a cost that would "stagger human
ity."' Kitchener's proclamation and the menace of
an uprising of the blacks' add additional blows to
those that have already staggered the humanity of
the civilized world. To many! of the Boers the
threat will of , course be an idle one.* They
would prefer banishment to submission to British
rule, and as their property has been already destroyed
they can suffer no further loss in? that way. They
will, however, have to consider not themselves but
others, and that consideration may make some of the
bravest. hesitate. The crisis in 'the war. has been
reached, and it remains to be" seen .how . the valiant
defenders of the liberties of South Africa will. meet it.
â¢ The design of the proclamation is of course to
bring the war to a speedy end. Virtually it amounts
to a warning that hereafter the Boers will not be
treated as prisoners of war. It' is an open declara
tion of a determination on the part of ihe to
conquer at all hazards, and from the tenor of the
discussion concerning the advisability of arming the
blacks to help on the conquest it seems more than
probable that if the Boers still continue* the strug
gle they will have to face a fight conducted according
to the severest methods known to the wars of any
period. . .
The /preamble closes with the assertion: ''It is
just to proceed against those still resisting, and es
pecially against those who, being in a position of
authority, are responsible for the continuance of the
present state of lawlessness." Therefore the procla
mation is issued that the commandants, field cornets
and other leaders of armed bands must surrender by
the date named or be permanently banished. .
The proclamation is preceded by a long preamble
setting forth reasons which in the judgment ... of
Kitchener justify it. These, briefly stated, are: The
Orange Free State and the South African republic
have been annexed to his Majesty's dominions; his
Majesty's forces are in complete possession .of all
the seats of government of the two republics and
of all towns and offices; a majority of the citizens
of the republics, to the number of 35,000, exclusive of
those who have fallen in war, are either prisoners or
have submitted to British authority and are living
peaceably in the towns of the colonies; the burgh
ers still in arms have lost nearly all their guns and
are incapable of carrying on regular war; they con
tinue, however, to nake isolated attacks upon out
posts and to disturb the country, thus checking the
resumption of industry; his Majesty's Government
is determined to put an end "to a. state of things
which is aimlessly prolonging bloodshed and de
struction and inflicting ruin upon a great majority of
the inhabitants."
a RECENTLY issued Parliamentary paper
Z\ contains the full text of the proclamation of
Â¦*Â¦ *- Lord Kitchener on August 7 calling upon all
Boer commanders and ..leaders to surrender their
foVces before September 15 under penalty of being
permanently banished from South Africa when cap
tured. The proclamation contains the further an
nouncement: "The cost of the maintenance of the
families of all burghers in the field who have not
surrendered by September 15 shall be recoverable
from such burghers and shall be a charge upon their
property, removable and immovable, in the two colo
nies."

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TIME works wondrous effects, and gradually the accepted order of tnln.es
is being changed â even as regards ordinary playing cards. ' That is to say.
a section of republican Frenchmen have at last risen up in arms against
allowing kings to reign even on playing cards.
Why, they say, should not President Loubet's or the late M. Carnot's likeness
appear on playing-cards where those of the familiar card kings now appear? Are
they not far more worthy of the honor, and would not the innovation be good
for the cause of republicanism; whereas, under present conditions, is not the idea
of monarchical government being constantly fostered covertly? .
Or, even 'f latter-day men are not deemed worthy of such honor, why not re
place the familiar king's head by pictures of such illustrious Frenchmen as Mac-
Mahon, ThieVs and Grevy, to name but three?
The same argument, too, is applied in the case of the modest looking card
queen, whom it is proposed to depose in, favor of republican women who have fig
ured prominently in the past.
This brilliant idea has already received a rude check, however, for the Parlia
mentary Commission which has-been sitting on a petit-ion on the subject, which
was recently forwarded to the Chamber, has endeavored to nip the notion in the
bud by replying that the change is impossible, inasmuch as it would ruin quite a
number of playing card factories. How this could well be is hard to discern, for
surely new dies must be cut some time or another,- and when they are it would be
just as easy to design heads of republicans as of monarchs. Moreover, if the new
cards were introduced they would probably rapidly become fashionable. In which
case numbers of people who are at present quite contented with their packs would
hasten to buy new ones in order to be up to date. We shall probably he^r more of
the proposal at some future date.
A notable feature of the report is the showing of
the extent to which irrigation is practiced. During
the decade 543 miles of irrigation ditches were con
structed at a cost of $1,508,469, and the results jus
tify the prediction that there will be a much larger
area of land-brought under irrigation in the imme
diate' future. Of a considerable portion of the Ter
ritory the i-.ort says: "In many essentials it is not
unlike certain districts on the southern and western
shoi.... _f the Mediterranean, where irrigation is older
than the history of the race that now inhabits it.
Without irrigation thb part of Arizona is a semi
tropical desert; with irrigation it is capable of sus
taining a dense population, limited only by the water
supply." The great problem of Arizona is that of
conserving the water of the rainfalls which now runs
away in torrents. With that problem solved-Arizona
will literally blossom as the rose.
The statistics of the bulletin show there are now
5809 farms in Arizona, with a total acreage of 1,935,
327 acres, of which 254,521 are improved. Of. these
farms 1769 are owned by Indians. In 1890 there were
only 104,128 acres of improved lands in the .Terri
tory. In 1890 the average size of farms was 910 acres,
and in 1900 468 acres. The total value of. the farm
land, with improvements, implements, and livestock,
is placed at $29,960,875. The increase in farm wealth
for the decade amounted to 162 per cent.
BiT the recently issued Census Bulletin relating
to agriculture in Arizona an excellent showing
is made of the progress .of they people â¢ in
building up the rural industries of that Territory.
It is stated that in 1890 agriculture in Arizona
ranked second to mining in the proportion of one to
seven, and that although the present value of the min
eral product of the Territory is not known, it is ob
served that the value of all agricultural products in
1899 equaled the value of all mineral products â¢ in
1889, and therefore.it is probable the relative impor
tance and. value of agricultural .products have in
creased in the decade.

Unless this is done the starch in every grain- of
wheat will stiffen, the peaches will blush with shame
on the tree and grapes will drown their chagrin by
getting drunk on their own juice at the insulting
mention of cheap freights.
This is in a case on -trial before a constitutional
commission. It is not yet closed, and we discuss
it at all with extreme diffidence. We do not desire
to appear in the character of what is called in Indiana
an "amicus curio." But we appeal to the two plain
tiffs, wheat and oil, to get on their warpaint and
feathers. This is no time to call on the non
producing and non-shipping experts who in cam
paigns appear vicariously for shippers and pro
ducers. Party platforms don't go now. The
patriots who ride to conventions on passes and de
nounce the railroad that carried them are not in it.
The refutation of the bold and remarkable, position
taken by the roads can be accomplished only by
reasoning as dose and logic as inexorable as the
foundation upon which it rests.
Live and learn. We have supposed that some
body paid the freight. If the producer, and he un
able to add it to his produce, if the price in the final
market did not bring enough to recoup him and
bring a profit, then he must lose. If the freight fol
low the produce and is added to the price paid by
the consumer, then the consumer must pay, and if
the freight put the price above his reach the market
ceases, to the injury of production. But all these
theories are knocked out. They retire like defeated
candidates at a primary, and the contention that
high freights are necessary to general prosperity is
established, for the time being at least.
The California railroads seem to have applied this
formula to freights, rendering it in the form,
"cheap freights mean a cheap State."
Heretofore it has been believed by producers and
shippers that a reduction in freights went into their
pockets, and whenever those receptacles of wealth
were attacked by. sweeny, and have been stepped on
by the elephant of adversity, a cry has risen and run
through the State from Siskiyou to San Diego, and,
in election years, from politic to politic, for a re
duction in railroad rates. To this end conventions
have resolved, Legislatures have legislated, and Rail
road Commissions have been mobbed, and is it pos
sible that when* there is an opportunity to prove
that high freights are an incubus imposed by the
octopus to injure the rest of us no proof ,is forth
coming? A gentleman and statesman who achieved
the Presidency of the United States and much honor
besides, and all well de'served, said, one time, that
the argument of cheapness was a fallacy, and de
clared that "a cheap coat meant a cheap man inside
of it."
If the roads are wrong it is high time that the
starch were taken out of their wheat argument, and
that the petroleum of Kern and surrounding coun
ties proceeded to lubricate an opposing exhibit; of
the question of high and low freights.
The railroads have presented their case system
atically and compactly. The trial court and the pub
lic will have no difficulty in comprehending it. The
transportation companies have been commendably
frank and seem' to have held back nothing that will
illuminate their defense. Their contention is that
low rates are detrimental to the State. They insist
that a low freight on wheat is ruinous to the farmer
and a low rate on* oil is ruinous to the oil pro
ducer. .They have backed this up by an expert show
ing that commands the respect of all men who ad
mire symmetry and consistency in argument and the
presentation of facts. So' far the other side of the
controversy has. not refuted this showing. No tes
timony equally expert, .and well backed by theory,
argument and facts, has been presented by the pro
ponents of low rates. The railroads are left at this
time in possession of the field as the champions of
the broad acres which produce wheat and of the
humble holes in the ground which gush oil. Wheat
has been represented as longing with an intense and
cereal anxiety for high freights, while petroleum
cries aloud from the ground, like the blood of the
slain, for vengeance on all who would lower the cost'
of getting it to market, and there you are!
THE Railroad Commission is trying judicially a
very, important , question. ,While the sp.ecific
issue is the rate charged by railroads. on Cali
fornia petroleum, the^ trial has furnished the oppor
tunity to present expert testimony on the general
subject of freight rates and their relation to the pro
ductive and industrial interests of the Stale.

Whether .the Supreme Court will sustain^ such" a
qualification for suffrage remains to be seen. Should
it be foundthat the law is valid, a new issue will con
front the American people. It will have to be deter
mined again whether or not hereditary governmental
privileges are to be tolerated -in. any part of these
United States, and that issue may become one of prac
tical politics much sooner than expected.
Neither the Senator's influence nor his argument
was sufficient to check the convention in its deter
mination to follow the North Carolina plan, and ac
cordingly the provisions of the proposed constitution
relating to suffrage contain" the much debated clause.
Certain residents of Alabama, whether illiterate or not,
are to be permitted to vote because they are the de
scendants of certain other men, and ; if the people
ratify the constitution Alabama will.have revived the
hereditary privilege for whose overthrow in this coun
try the American Revolution was fought.

p "1 1">1 HE well-known steam schooner
1 Alolja was burned to the water' 3
B edge at her moorings off Sausalito
JJL yesterday morning. The fire broke
out in or near the galley about 3
o'clock, and when the tug Reliance from
San Francisco reached her aboct two
hours later all hope of saving the vessel
from serious damage was gone. The hull
aft was one mass of flames and a few
minutes after Captain Shaw got the tug's
pumps playing on the fire the mainmast
went by the board. Then the woodwork
holding the guys of the smokestack burn
ed away and it fell over the side. The
deckhouses aft burned like tinder and at
6 o'clock the after part of the hull was
consumed to within a foot of the water.
By 7 o'clock the fire was out and the Re
liance ran the charred wreck on the mud
flats. - TT ,
The Aloha arrived here from Usal on
the 6th Inst. with a cargo of 280 cords of
bark. She went direct to Redwood City,
where some of her crew deserted. After
many delays she was discharged and
Wednesday night Captain Wehman
took her to Sausalito, anchoring near
the Robert Dollar and Rival. The
intention of the owners was to com
plete the AToha's complement of men
from the Robert Dollar and send her to
sea yesterday morning. Instead, how
ever as soon as the steamer was an
chored at Sausalito all hands left her ex
cept the captain, and he sat up all nignt
to guard his ship.
According to the story told the owners.
Captain Wehman made the rounds of the
steamer at midnight and found every
thing all right. He. went into the dining
room, inspected the galley, went through
the fireroom and engine room, and every
thing being all right went to his own
room forward and sat down to read.
About three hours later he smelled lire
and upon making an examination found
the vessel ablaze in the cabin adjoining
the galley. He" rang the ship's bell to at
tract attention, but it was a long time be
fore assistance came and then it was only
in the shai>e of a small boat from the
San Francisco Yacht Club. The vessel Is
damaged to the extent of $2o,000 or $30,000
and there is about that much insurance
0I The" Aloha was built In 1S98 by Hay &
Wright for John S. Kimball. Shft was In
the Fort Bragg: trade until the Klonaike
excitement broke out. when she was built
up into a passenger boat and sent north.
Later she went on the Seattle-Skaguay
run, and when the John S. Kimball Com
pany was formed she was one of the ves
sels turned over to that concern. Some
months ago the Dollar Steamship Com
pany absorbed the Kimball Company, and
one of the first things done by the new
managing owners was to turn the Aloha
back into a steam schooner and place her
in the lumber trade again. She was 215.23
tons net burden, 126 feet 5 Inches long, 30
feet 5 inches beam and 10 feet deep. Ex
perts think the machinery can ne used
again, but that the hull will not be worth
rebuildirfe..

it. It is refreshing."
Dr. J. H. Bush, Toledo, Ohio, writes:
"Newbro's Herpicide has given better sat-

Mrs. Borkey of Chadron, Neb., says of
Herpicide: "It cleaned my head of dan-
druff and stopped my hair' from falling
out. It is the best remedy for dandruff I
ever used, and I have used a great many."
R. S. Coleman, Ann Arbor, Mich., says:
"I have used two bottles of Herpicide and
derived benefit therefrom."

FOOD
One great cause of sleeplessness in
infants is improper or insufEcierit
food. An infant will usually sleep
well after taking food that satisfies
and nourishes. Mellin's Food satisfies
and nourishes ; contains enough to
satisfy and the kind to nourish.

Chicago was depressed by foreign advices
and free selling by the Northwest, and de
clined from 73c to 71%c. Holders realized ond
the market lacked support/ There were foreign
acceptances, but not â¢ sufficient to absorb all
speculative offerings. Later on, however, the
selling seemed exhausted, and there was more
tone, with New York buying. Clearances were
over 1.C00.000 bushels,' with two ports to hear
from. The Cincinnati Price Current .estimated
the crop at 713,000.000 bushels, with 300,000.000
for export Â¦ Minneapolis stocks decreased 990,
000 bushels in five days. The Manitoba crop is
estimated at 52,000,000 bushels, the best on rec
ord, and 20,000 extra farm hands will be needed
to harvest it. The railroads are Â¦ making: spe

ii9$ IC ? GO> Ausr - iS-â September wheat opened
was weak. and Northwestern observers said
conditions were favorable for harvesting the
crop of spring wheat. Under liquidation the
market early dropped to 71%c. A rally to 72%c
followed covering by a few shorts, who were
impressed by the magnitude of seaboard clear
ances Sentiment in the main, however was
bearish The prospect of a heavy movement
from the two Dakotas and Minnesota was si
lently reckoned with and ths impression pre
vailed that a heavy foreign demand firmly sus
tained would be necessary to maintain prices.
Liquidation again started the market on the
downward course. Stop-loss orders were rearh
and near the end of the session September
touched 71%c. The close was weak l^ic under
yesterday at 71Vic.
Liquidation ruled corn prices. The prepon
derant tone of reports on the crop was of im
provement in the prospects for the late-sown
maize. Almost the only demand came from,
shorts, who were taking profits. Liverpool
was weak. September . closed weak IViffilHc
lower at 57%c. â¢
Oats ruled easy In sympathy with corn. The
close was weak. September %@lc down at 35%
@35%c.
Provisions were dull. A little support from
packers was sufficient to check the declining
tendency of lard and ribs, but pork ruled weak
September pork closed 25c lower, lard a shade
down, and ribs 5@7%c depressed.

"Prunes are held steadily at quotations, with
buying limited almost wholly to small lots.

the association is going to name prices shortly
serving to detract interest from future goods.

"Currants occupied the center of the stage
yesterday, a sale of 50 barrels at 9c constitut

the other sido confirm previous statements of
damage by rain, but how serious the damage
may be it is impossible to eaj r . London ac

Municipal creditors who desire to realize
upon their claims before the tax mo.ney is
available have gone 'to the banks and to
private money lenders, securing advances
on the warrants at . a Â¦Â¦ small discount â
usually one-half of one per cent a month."
The money received into the city treasury
exclusive .-of* tax .payments is far from
sufficient to meet all, demands. Rather
than to wait until tax money Is in hand
employes and other creditors resort to
discounting their warrants. â¢
Because of the threatened long litigation
and possible tie-up of funds bankers have
put a stop to the loans. The officials at
the First National Bank and the Oakland
Bank of Savings have shut down on city
warrants because of the uncertainty sur
rounding the legality" of -the assessment
increase.- Some of the financiers have
raised the question whether, the board of
equalization has not invalidated the entire
assessment roll in its attempt ' to make
good the cut on the water corijpany's as
'sessment. .
The conditions are primarily due to the
protests and the preliminary moves which
have been made by property owners who
are protesting against the increases which
the Council as a board of equalization
has made on many holdings in the busi
ness center. If the legal fights which
have been threatened shall be carried Into
the courts the municipal taxes, the first
Installment on which is due in ,Novem

stress of financial difficulties will con
front the government much, more serious
than the ordinary fiscal year deficits.

OF BOILING WATEH
Employe of a Fresno Cannery Has a
Narrow Escape From Terrible
Death.
FRESNO. Aug. 15.â D. R. Hawes fell
into a vat of boiling water at the Griffin
& Skelton cannery, this afternoon and was
severely burned nearly to his waist.
Hawes is a truckman emploved in the
cannery. During the afternoon he had oc
casion to cross the vat of water, used to
turn into the engines when quick steam
is desired. There was a board across the
vat used as a bridge. "Just as Hawes
stepped on the board it slipped and dropped
him into the wafer. Luckily the tank was
but three feet deep. Hawes pulled him
self out of the scalding water, but fainted
almost as soon as he got to the floor.
Medical assistance â¢was Immediately
called and his burns dressed. It will be
several weeks before he is out again.
"For eleven years we paid the water
company $5 a month for a private'hy
drant at our mills. When we put on our
hose to-night we got a stream of ten
feet from the nozzle. It wasMmposslblo
for us to do a thing toward saving our
big plant. For my part I am done. After
seeing the labor of years wiped out in
two hours I quit. The works will not be
rebuilt." *
The Niehaus Company was composed of
E. C. Niehaus, Otto Niehaus and G. A.
Schuster. After the fire was under con
trol Schuster said:
Some of the burned structures were
built on piling out over the water side
of Second street. Everding's loss was in
the stock on hand and machinery. The
Haywood lumber yards suffered $1000 loss
from burned lumber. Across Second
street Everding's gristmill caught fire, but
the firemen saved it from destruction. '
The door and sash factory, with 6000
doors in stock, the dry kiln and packing
shops, were as quickly destroyed. The
stables went next, but all the horse3
were saved, and then the flames licked
up immense piles of finished and rough
lumber. The El Dorado Oil Works, to the
north of the mills, on University avenue,
west of Second street, were next In line
of the flames. One building, stored with
cocoanut oil, valued at $1000, was destroy
ed. The Everdlng Starch Works and
dwelling were wiped 'out; loss $13,000.
These were all Â¦within easy distance â¢ of
the mill buildings.
Nearly 100 men are thrown out of em
ployment by the fire, of whom sixty-five
were working in the big mills, which
Schuster said woiild not be rebuilt. To
save the wharves at the mills, laden with
hundreds of thousands of feet of lumber,
scores of volunteers threw piles of the
lumber into the bay and ripped up the in
flammable wharf, checking the progress
of the flames. One of the Oakland fire
engines was stationed at the West Berke
ley wharf, where it pumped salt water
from the bay, the stream effectually pre
venting the northward spread of the fire
at the El Dorado works. There the fire
men centered their efforts after it waa
seen that the mill property was doomed.
Night Watchman Joe Ramas discovered
the fire breaking out in lively shape at the
mill engine-room about 10 o'clock. He
tried to telephone an alarm call from the
mill, but time was lost because the line
was out of order. The flames spread so
quickly that no alarm was necessary to
arouse the neighborhood. The mills were
provided with a private hydrant, to which
hose was quickly attached, but a stream
of only ten feet from the nozzle could be
got, so light was; the pressure. The fire
attacked the main building, a two-story
frame structure. 100x175 feet, and contain
ing $28,000 worth of machinery. In an hour
it was in ashes.

Aside from the Textile Council's action
it was also shown by the Central Labor
Union, which met to-night, that every or
panized labor body in Fall River will act
in union ivith the operatives.
The meeting to-night might be said to
have fully represented the opinion of the
textile operatives.
The council has no power to order ac
tion, as it is purely an advisory body, but
its suggestions have great weight* with
the union.

When searched at the police station the
officers found a pistol and a number o"
loose cartridges in Stone's pockets, also
a pocket-knife, a bunch of skeleton keys
and a Jimmy.
Mrs. A. M. Graham, who lives with the
Harringtons, thought the burglar was
trying to enter her window and was
greatly frightened. She thought there
were two burglars.but it afterward de
veloped that the voices she heard were
those of the burglar and his captor.
Stone was then taken to the Central
police station and charged with burglary.
Detectives Wrenn and Dlnan were sent
out from the main office. and investigate:!
the premises, but were unable to find any
tools. W. S. Kittle, whose residence ad
joins the Harrington house, heard the
shooting and saw the burglar taken into
custody. -
Instead of obeying the man leaped a
fence, and while he was going 1 over the
obstacle Helbush fired. The shot simply,
accelerated Stone's speed.' The officer
followed and fired again just as the fel
low was rushing through the yard of
W. B. Harrington's residence, at- 2521
Steiner street. The second bullet had its
effect and the burglar came to a stand
still and- surrendered after a struggle with
the special. Helbush took him to the Re
ceiving Hospital and the doctors found
on examination that one bullet had grazed
his groin.
Officer Helbush displayed courage â¢ In
capturing the burglar. He was walking
down Jackson street, and when in the
neighborhood of Steiner he heard a. noise
in the rear of the Spruance residence.
Without a moment's hesitation ' he en
tered the place and climbed through the
opening of an additional wing that is be
ing added to the house. As he emerged
into the yard he saw his man leap from
the Spruance rear porch to the sod, and
Helbush ordered him to halt.
The police, however, believe he Is the
man who has been operating in that vi
cinity for the past week and Is known as
"Jack the Borer." Detectives Wrenn and
Dlnan have been searching for the bur
glar, who uses an auger Ho: gain admit
tance to houses. He left impressions of
his work at the residences of A. B. Ham
mond, .2601 Jackson street; Dr. Bowles,
2626 Pacific avenue, and it \ is thought
Stone was at these places earlier in the
evening. . Â¦ '*-
Robert Stone, a 21-year-old burglar, was
captured last night by Special Officer
Herman H. Helbush while trying to force
an entrance into the rear of the residence
of John Spruance at. 2504 Jackson street.
Helbush fired two shots at 'his man be
fore the latter would surrender. One of
the bullets passed through Stone's cloth
ing and; he thought he was hit. "When
taken to the Central police station he re
fused to divulge his identity.

Force and not parliamentary agitation
as the means of securing Ireland her lib
erty was advocated by O'Donovan Rossa.
and other speakers at the Irish National
demonstration at Fifty-second and Hal
stead streets to-night. Setting fire to the
principal cities of England, as the means
of weakening the British power and so
creating a favorable opportunity for the
Irish to rise and assert their rights by
arms was the most loudly applauded sen
timent expressed during the evening.
"The idea of obtaining anything from
England," declared Rossa, "save by the
sword, 1 is nonsense."
At Oswald's Grove, O'Donovan Rossa
in his address agreed with Michael Davitt
that emigration is drawing the heart's
blood out of Ireland, but the worst thing
for the country, declared the speaker, is
the fact that there is really no disposi
tion among the Irishmen to really do
anything.
Resolutions were adopted announcing
faith in the patriotism and ability, of the
men who are directing the Irish cause
in Ireland, declaring admiration for and
sympathy with the Boers and regretting
that the United States has Withheld its
active aid from them.
A second meeting was held in the even-
Ing, at which Davitt repeated his ad
dress, and speeches were made by a num
ber of local Irishmen.
A meeting nearly in strength to that at
Sunnyside Park was held at Oswald's
Grove under the auspices of the Irish Na
tionalists. At the former meeting Michael
Davitt was the chief speaker and at the
latter O'Donovan Rossa.
Davitt, after contrasting the conditions
In Ireland to-day with conditions as they
existed in the early part of the nineteenth
century, said: /
I was here in. this city addressing the Irish
Eocieties of Chicago fifteen years ago to-day.
AVitnln that time fully 600,000 young men and
young women have crossed from Ireland to
these United States, not to return, but to re
main.~ Allowing half of these' to- have been
men, the loss to Ireland and the. gain to the
republic would be a quarter of a million oÂ£
t.ie- younger and brawnier of our manhood.
That is eiffht times the number of men of
another race who for the last two years have
for a time beaten one of the greatest empires
in the world in the field, and who are still
unconquered, and I believe, unconquerable, by
the same power which has been mainly in
strumental in forcing our people from their
own to other countries.
' The notion obtains/ In many minds here In
America that nothing/would have been or could
have been done at home during the last twenty
years were it not for the unstinted -monetary
support that has flowed across the Atlantic,
inat is a ridiculous delusion. I venture to say
that our people at home, poor aa they are,
have subscribed five dollars for every one given
by our friends and kindred here. . It is not
America that has been pouring ita treasure
out to Ireland, /but the other way about. Forty
thousand of our young people come here from
the old land every year to add to the .wealth
producing power, of the States. Econimically
valued, these emigrants are worth $1000 each
to the industrial assets of Uncle Sam. Â¦
CHICAGO, Aug. 15.â Four thousand Chi
cago Irish-Americans gathered at Sunny
side Park this afternoon on the twenty

dred and third anniversary of Hugh
O'Neill's victory over -the English at the

The Press will also say that the plan
contemplated by the 'United States Steel
Corporation Is nothing more than a high
development of the scheme that has pre
vailed in the Carnegie plant since 1S92.
After studying the success attained" by
Carnegie, it Is said that Morgan and his
assistants in the management of the
United States Steel Corporation deter
mined that it would be wise to extend th9
scheme.
At a recent conference, however, be
tween the executive board of the Amal
gamated Association and Charles Schwab,
the president of the United States" Steel
Corporation, it came out that Schwab, un
der the direction of Morgan,, had formu
lated a profit sharing scheme whereby it
was proposed to make every employe of
the steel corporation a co-operator in the
business. â¢ .
The plan was conceived before the strike
was thought of, and then it was expected
that it might ne put in operation in two
years. It required time to formulate the
details of such a tremendous undertak
ing.- For this reason announcement vra3
withheld.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.- The Press will
say to-morrow: J. P. Morgan has plan
ned the greatest labor union of the age,
a union of labor and capital. According
to his plans, stock of the United State3
Corporation valued at several "millions of
dollars at par has been set aside for the
purchase at inside figures by the 165,000
men employed by the companies that
make up the great steel trust. *Â«. is con
templated to form this copartnership be

FIRE DESTROYS
MUCH PROPERTY
HARRISBURG, Pa., Aug. 15.â The Dem
ocratic, State Convention to-day nom
inated Judge Harmon Yerkes of Doyles
town for Supreme Court Judge, and Rep
resentative Andrew Palm of Meadville for
State Treasurer. The platform makes no
reference to W. J. Bryan or national af
fairs, being confined exclusively to State
matter's. In the closing moments of the
convention resolutions were adopted with
out debate and by a practically unanimous
vote which will have the effect of blocking
any effort that may be contemplated look
ing to the withdrawal of the candidate
for State Treasurer and the substituting
of an anti-Quay Republican on a fusion
ticket.
The contest between the rival Philadel
phia factions for recognition by. the con
vention resulted in a harmony agreement
between the recognized leaders of the two
elements. A committee was designated
to co-operate with former Governor Rob
ert E. Pattison, chairman of the regular
city committee, In adjusting the differ
ences that may arise in reorganizing the
party in Philadelphia.
Following the ratification of the har
mony programme an effort was made by
J. O. Ullrich of Schuylkill to expel the
Philadelphia delegates. He made a speech
criticizing the harmony resolutions and
condemning the leaders of the Philadel
phia Democracy. An assistant sergeant
at-arms tried to force Ullrich to take his
seat, and there was almost a riot. The
police interfered, and after much excite
ment the Ullrich resolution to expel the
delegates was rejected. 'â¢ .
The decision of Chairman Keenan was
appealed from and was sustained.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.â For some
time past the officials of the Treasury
Department have had under serious con
sideration the problem of how to prevent
Chinese from crossing the Mexican bor
der into the United States. A conclusion
has at last been reached which. It Is be
lieved, will go a long ways to the solu
tion of the matter. Under the treaty be
tween the United States and China Immi
grants from the latter country are al
lowed to pass through the United States
to any other foreign country, provided
however, that the treasury officials are
fatisfied their passage through this coun
try is for the bonafide purpose of -taking
up a residence in another and not for the
purpose of ultimately attempting to re
turn to the United States. During the
last few years many thousands of Chi
nese have been landed at the port of San
I-Tancisco under alleged contract to work
on plantations and railroads in Southern
Mexico. They have been permitted to
X^ass throush without hindrance, but a
careful Investigation has developed the
fact that not 10 per cent of them ever
reach the points to which they are tick
eted, but leave the trains at points along
the northern border of Mexico. In a short
t! I? e , y 1^' reach the United States, which,
officials claim, undoubtedly was their or
iginal purpose. The treasury officials
nave decided to take advantage of the
provision in the treaty that stipulates
that they shall be satisfied of the good
faith of the Chinamen seeking to go
through the United States to a foreign
country, and Instructions will be sent the
officials at San Francisco to require that
each Chinaman claiming Mexico as his
destination shall establish his good faith.
If the Chinaman is under contract to per
form labor in Mexico, he may present his
contract as evidence of good faith, but
In case of his failure to satisfy the offi
cials he will not be permitted to land. It
is expected this order will have the de
sired effect of keeping out a large per
centage of Chinese who would go to Mex
ico with the real purpose of ultimately
crossing the border into the United States.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 15.â The State
Department Is waiting a reply from Spe
cial Commissioner Rockhill as to the date
of the signing of the protocol, as the dis
posal of this subject will pave the way
to taking up the question of new commer
cial treaties with China and facilitate
other important details in execution of
the protocol. Whether the present treaty
relations with China are sufficient or an
entirely new fabric will be required de
pends considerably upon the terms of the
protocol. It is expected that this docu
ment will be forwarded by Rockhill. and
not until it is in hand will the authorities
here feel like reaching a final determlna-
tion as to the scope of negotiations on
such new commercial treaty relations as
may become desirable. The protocol itself
appears to contemplate the creation of an
international board to sit probably . at
Shanghai, and to have charge of certain
details of commercial relations between
the powers and China. But it is expected
that the powers will further consider the
question of forming this board before it is
actually brought into existence.

The case then went over until October
to enable Mr. Lloyd to join the pilgrim
age to Louisville of the Knights Templar,
of which he Is supreme master.
A few days ago Mrs. Eggers filed a pe
tition for part'al distribution of the es
tate, presenting her account at the same
time for settlement. Mrs. Meyers imme
diately objected to many of the Items set
forth in the account, claiming that they
were exorbitanl. The claim of, Lloyd &
Wood ' for $5000 was particularly objected
to, and protest was entered to the pay
ment of $18,536 S8 to satisfy a mortgage
against the Eggers Vineyard Company.
When the matter was called for hearing
yesterday Reuben H. Lloyd of the firm of
Lloyd & Wood stated to the court that"
the demand for $5000 was not unreasona
ble. He stated that when he took hold of
the estate as attorney for the executrix
a debt of $125,000 stood against it, but
through careful management the value of
the property had so increased that the in
debtedness has been liquidated and the
unir.cumbered property was now worth
$270,000. In conclusion Mr. Lloyd filed an
itemized statement of the services ren
dered by the firm of which he is a mem
ber.
Eggers was a vineyard owner of Fresno
County and left an estate which was val
ued at $250,585. Mrs. Sophie Eggers, de
cedent's widow, was named as executrix.
Shortly after she assumed the duties of
her trust Mrs. Ida Meyer, a daughter, in
stituted a contest on the ground that Mrs.
Eggers intended to deprive her Of a large
portion of her lawful share of the estate.
An advance of $10,000 made by Mr. Eggers
to his daughter was charged against her
by Mrs. Eggers, with the result stated.
A contention has arisen among the rela
tives of the late George H. Eggers over
the distribution of his estate! the demand
of Lloyd & Wood for $5000 for legal ser
vices rendered . since decedent's estate
came into the control of the Probate
Court being the chief cause of the dis
turbance.
Legal Services Rendered Is
? Exorbitant.

EGGERS' DAUGHTER FILES
OPPOSITION" TO ACCOUNT
Conger arrived here six weeks ago from
Honolulu. He .was .accompanied by a Jap
anese servant and was. looked upon- as a
"high roller" at the Palace Hotel. Con
ger avoided interviews yesterday and re
mained away from the hotel.
When Conger was brought into Judge
Dunne's chambers he was accompanied
by a Mr. Cooper, a planter from the Ha
waiian Islands. Conger held a consulta
tion with his friend and with President
Gilbert, and then 'made a settlement.
Cooper paid $283 In cash and Conger gave
the publishing company his note for the
balance due. . ' < .
The Gilbert Publishing Company, _ 927
Market street, filed the complaint against
Conger, alleging that he had collected $525
without authority while acting as agent
for the company in the Hawaiian Islands
and refused to make an accounting. Pres
ident Gilbert of the company swore that
Conger was about to-be married andleave
the State. On this accusation Conger was
made a prisoner, and taken before Judge
Dunne, who fixed a bond in the sum of
$1000. â¢ , â¢ - â¢ Â¦ -.-.â¢' .
Roy W. Conger, nephew of United
States Minister Conger, .was arrested yes
terday morning at the Palace Hotel by
Deputy Sheriff Hollingsworth on an order
of arrest issued by Superior Judge Dunne.
Colonel Thomas F.- Barry, president of
the Celtic Union, made some remarks in
which he pointed ouf that the labor of the
society was riot only one of interest to the
Irish people, but to the whole world. The
way to preserve a race, he said, was to
preserve its language and the enthusiasm
with which the movement ' to preserve
the Gaelic language was being met
proved that it "shall not perish from the
earth.''- .
Thd musical programme was unusually
artistic. The splendid voice of Mrs. M.
Quadtman was heard to good advantage
as the leader of the sopranos in the Gae
lic Choral'Socicty. Professor D. Manlloyd,
who possesses a voice of unusual bril
liancy, carried his audience by storm
with -his rendition of "An Cruisgin Lan."
Jeremiah Deasy sang two old Gaelic songs
in the rich language of his. fathers. Wal
lace A. Sabin rendered an Irish overture,
Mrs. John W. Madden contributed a so
prano solo and Mme. Inez Carusi sang to
an accompaniment on the Irish harp. S.
J. Sandy, Miss Annie Rooney and the
Gaelic School Orchestra rendered selec
tions. Then the audience rose and "God
Save Ireland" sprang from the throats of
tht% mighty chorus and with a prayer for
the freedom of their native country Feis
Ceoll Agus Seangas was at an end.
No nation, he said, could retain its in
dividuality without an Individual lan
guage. When the language of one nation
is thrust upon another the individuality
of the weakest nation is merged with
that of the people of the strongest.
Hence, .to give , Ireland the ~ strength ? to
attain her object the people, he said,
must be cemented with a common, indi
vidual language, and with their rehabili
tation would come renewed hopes of hap
piness and freedom in the future. â¢
Language and Individuality.
He then gave a brief history of the
Gaelic League and told of the great work
which had been accomplished by Dr. Hyde
of the Dublin University, who, as the
dean of the great, corps of scholars now
studying the ancient literature of. their
forefathers, wasr building the foundation
upon which the temple of Irish liberty will
rise.
The Rev. James McDonald also ad
dressed the audience, . but not in Gaelic.
He explained that the rising generation
of the Irish do not speak the tongue of
their fathers not because of preterence
for English, but because the language of
their fathers had been wrested from them
by their oppressors. This movement to
restore the Uaehc language in Ireland, he
said, was the strongest yet made to bring
freedom to Ireland since the flight of the
Earls. â¢. â -
"I will speak a word in English for the
benefit of those who did not understand
my Gaelic. There was a time when the
Irish were not ashamed of the language
of which they should be proudâ proud of
its history and associations. "What would
you think of a German, a Frenchman or a
Spaniard who would laugh at his own lan
guage? Are we to be the first to point
the ringer of scorn at the language of our
fathers? The finger of scorn, in truth, is
pointed at those who know not one word
of the tongue of their fathers; not at
those who reve/encÂ© it for Its honored
place In the world."
the Thoughtless.
Metropolitan Hall was crowded to the
doors by Ireland's friends, the Irish, and
in a tongue seldom heard at public gath
erings eloquent speakers urged the sup
port of the people to restore a language
that was the language of civilization be
fore Athens became the center of ancient
culture. The Rev. Peter C. Yorke deliv
ered an address in the Gaelic tongue. The
aged Irish, and there were many in the
gathering, were in raptures, but Joy came
to, their children only when out of the
maze of sounds unintelligible to them
there would come the word of a city or a
town familiar to their ears. Then the chil
dren of parents who first learned the
Gaelic tongue, some of them, would laugh
at the strangeness of it all. This fur
nished Father Yorke with the subject for
a few remarks in English. When the ap
plause that greeted his Gaelic peroration
had subsided he returned to the platform
and said: â¢ - : :
Out of the past ages the language of the
Gael has come. with renewed strength, the
freeing of Ireland as its mission. Feis
Ceoil Agus , Seangas, given Â¦ by the . Gaelic
League of California under the direction
of the Father O'Growney branch of San
Francisco at Metropolitan Hall last even
ing marked this city's greatest initial
demonstration in the .movement to restore
the Gaelic language ' throughout Ireland,
that the individuality of the Irish people
may be rehabilitated and their hands
given new; strength to carry on the. right
against the yoke of England.

was dismissed but a short time ago. He
probably had in his possession a key to
the side door and it is known that he had
knowledge of- the combination of the safe
and of the fact that the safe was used
as a depository for moneys belonging to
employes. The detectives expect to make
an arrest to-day.
Dr. M. E. Kibbe of 1023 Sutter street,
who is at present managing the associa
tion's affairs, was notified as soon as the
theft was discovered. He worked all day
on the case and did not notify the police
until he had formed a pretty good Idea
as to the Identity of the burglar.
In addition to the association's money
the thief got away with a considerable
sum belonging to employes of the concern,
who preferred leaving their savings with
the cashier to depositing them in a brfnk.
The thief gained an entrance to the of
fice through a small door on Powell street.
From his manner of working he was evi

Valuables Mysteriously
Disappear at a Late
Supper.
Miss Ethel Hornick, one of the leading
members of the Empire Company now
playing, at the Columbia Theater, Is
mourning the loss of a box of valuable
Jewelry that disappeared on Tuesday
evening from her supper table at the Cafe
Zinkand.
Miss Hornick went to supper after the
performance on "the evening mentioned
with Miss Mary Van Buren, T. Daniel
Frawley and Mr. Kinmond, manager for
Mr. Frawley. The actress carried, with
her into the restaurant a little box con
taining her purse and jewels. This box
she placed on the table beside her. When
the members of the party left the restau
rant the precious parcel was overlooked.
Miss Hornick had not gone far, however,
before she discovered that she had forgot
ten her jewel box and with her escort re
turned to the cafe to get.it. But it was
too late. Although scarcely more than
five minutes had elapsed since she had
left the restaurant no trace of the box
could be found.
Yesterday Miss Hornick placed the mat
ter in the hands of the police and the de
tectives spent a busy day looking for the
Jewel box. Miss Hornick, when seen at
the theater last evening, said:
"I went to the Zlnkand as the guest of
Miss Mary Van Buren. In the party were
Mr. Frawley and his manager. . I carried
with me a .box containing some Jewels
and my purse, which contained $25. The
box was done up In tissue paper and real
ly looked like a box of candy. I imagine
that some one took the box believing it
contained bonbons and that when it was
opened and its valuable contents dis
closed was afraid to return it. All
the valuables In the box were, the gifts of
dear friends and their value is really more
one of a personal association than a mon
etary one. I have offered a reward of $75
for its return and promise that no ques
tions will be asked."
Supposed Leper at Large.
The officials of the Health Department
were notified yesterday morning that a
half nude man, apparently insane, ap
peared on the Presidio hills and when the
sentry started after him he took to his
heels, never stopping until he had landed
somewhere in the Richmond district. . The
health officials surmise that the man may
be a leper who escaped from the hospital
some time ago. The police were notified
and a special. watch will be kept until the
man is put in some safe place.

The trial of Daniel J. Sullivan on the
charge of forging Judge Cabaniss' name
to an order on the City Treasurer for the
return of $1C4O bail money on March 15
last was concluded before a jury In Judge
La wlor's court yesterday afternoon. The
case was given to the jury shortly after
5 o'clock, and in less than an hour a ver
dict of guilty was returned. !
Judge Cabaniss and John O. Reis, chief
deputy in the Treasurer's office, were re
called for further cross-examination and
the prosecution rested. Reis testified that
the signatures of 'the Police Court clerks
were not essential on the ball orders.
The defendant was called to the stand
and 'frankly admitted signing Judge Ca
baniss' name to the order and drawing
the money, but it was done without; any
Intent, to defraud any one, he said. He
jokingly remarked to Reis when drawing
the money, he said, that it was for a Chi
nese client. He was working without sal
ary in the- warrant and bond clerk's office
and got what he could pick up In the
shape of commission.
Judges Signed Afterward.
When the new charter came into effect
everything was mixed up in the warrant
clerk's ottice, the defendant said, and
there was a ' supposed shortage of $400.
Warrant Clerk Peery employed him to
straighten out the accounts and he did so.
Then Peery asked him to, remain and look
after the books.' Sometimes he was in the
habit when Judges happened to be away
of y taking unsigned bail orders to the City
Treasurer's oflice and drawing the money,
getting the signature of the Judges after
ward. In the case of Wong Yow, the
Chinese wanted the money and ottered
him $2 50 to get it for. him. He could not
get judge Cabaniss, so he signed the
judge's name to the order, drew the
money and handed it to the Chinese, get
ting his $2 50, but not before a bond had
been substituted for the cash bail. Clerk
Peery wrote on the back of the ''order
after he returned from the Treasurer's
office, "Bond substituted' for cash." He
had handled about $300,000 while . in the
warrant clerk's 'office and no .bond' had
been required of him.
Jury Not Out Long.
Wong Yow testified to . the defendant
giving him the $1640 and getting the $2 50
commission. â¢ .. . >
Attorney Joseph Coffey had been called
as a witness for the defense in the morn
ing, but questions asked him were ob
jected to and sustained. It was later ad
mitted that he would testify to having
seen the defendant and- Wong Tow to
gether in the warrant clerk's office, and
that a bond had been substituted for the
cash ball. This closed the case for. the
defense. *
After arguments of counsel the Judge
delivered, his charge to the jury and that

The friends of George W. Witty, whose
lifeless body was found in a lodging house
on Mission; street Wednesday evening, do
not believe he committed suicide. 1 - but
think he was murdered and robbed. Last
night several of them, among whom was
ex-Insurance Commissioner Ed McCabe,
visited police . headquarters and asked
Captain of Detectives Seymour to make a
thorough Investigation. Seymour at once
detailed two of his best men on tbe case
with instructions to spare no effort in
definitely determining whether Witty died
by his own hand or was the Victim of an
assassin.
In speaking about the tragic ending of
the man who was instrumental In ter
minating the earthly career of Sontag
and landing Evans, his companion in
crime, in the penitentiary for the rest of
his life, McCabe said:
"I am satisfied that Witty, with whom
I was well acquainted, did not commit
suicide.- He was of a very sunny disposi
tion and looked with scorn on anybody
who even hinted at the thought of sui
cide. Shortly before he entered the Mis
sion-street house he met several friends,
all of whom claim that he was unusually
happy. After entering the place he asked
for Josie Escott, a young woman whom
he had known > for several years. On
being told that she was out, it is claimed
by the inmates of the house, he immedi
ately walked into. .one of the rooms and
shot himself.
"I am not at all satisfied with this state
ment and am satisfied that - they know
more than they have told. . My reason for
thinking that Witty was murdered and
robbed is that only $3 was found on his
body by the . Coroner. Last Saturday he
had about $200, which he gave to a Mar
ket-street saloon-keeper for safe-keeping.
The lcllowing day he drew the money and
made a few small purchases. As he was
not a man to .squander money, I am sat
isfied Witty had the amount with him
when he was put out of the way and that
it was stolen by the murderer. In con
junction with other; friends of the dead
man I intend to do all in my power, to
definitely â¢ ascertain ' whether or 'not he
died from an assassin's bullet."
"â¢-Mr3. Escott claims that she and Witty
had some words a few hours before the
shooting, and fearing that he intended to
Injure , her. she secretly .. left the house.
When she returned in the evening she
was horrified to learn his body was at the
Morgue.- . ' .'
Witty was employed by.Curtin's Detec
tive Agency in protecting non-union men
from violence while en route to this city.

handy man with a gun. His mother, who
is said to be- wealthy, lives . in Stanislaus

to Investigate His
Death.
Captain Seymour Asked
By reason of this treatment, the boy
says, his health became impaired, his in
firmities more pronounced and his mental
ity weakened. A week ago he was turned
into the street. He roamed about in the
city and finally went out to the Richmond
district, where he was arrested. The case
will be investigated.
Secretary White of the society visited
the locality last night and arrested the
youth. At the Central police station the
boy told a pathetic tale of cruelty and
suffering.- He said his name was Bernard
Tirat-, age 19 years and that his father,
who is in good circumstances, resides at
616% Filbert street. Since birth the boy
has been a cripple, though his reason did
not show signs of weakening until he had
reached his sixteenth year. But since he
was able to remember things, he says, he
has been treated cruelly. Most of his life
was spent in a dark cellar chained to a
post, "like an animal," he averred, and
beaten whenever the mood seized his
guardians.
Some days ago residents of the Rich
mond district notified the Society for the
Prevention j of Cruelty to Children of a
strange, deformed youth who wandered
.from door to door begging crusts of bread,
and who when night overtook him sought
shelter in barns and underneath, houses.

It appears that Miss Thompson origi
nated something startling In the way of
a dance, which is Introduced in the third
act of her production. It Is entitled "A
Brown Shines Out in the Dance.
For a short time these incidents came
very near marring the opening perform
ance. Miss Florence Roberts saved the
night by presence of mind and Mr. Brown
by playing "thunder."
last night. Miss Charlotte Thomp
son, author of "Silver Mounted Harness,"
"got on her high horse," as an actor put
it, and tried to ride over Bothwell Brown,
dancing master. The dancing master
proved a high hurdle, however, Miss
Thompson's flery, untamed steed hesita
ted and the fajr rider was lost.
, It may be reinarked that neither Miss
Thompson nor Mr. Brown speak, now as
they pass" by. Neither do" they shower
praise on each other's work as in the
past. Metaphorically speaking, their
daggers are drawn. This sad state of
things is due to a number of exciting
incidents that happened behind the scenes
on Monday night. Miss Thompson lost
her temper and said unkind things about
the dancing master, and Mr. Brown retal
iated by saying "she was no lady."
THE edifying spectacle of an au
thoress and a dancing master
engaged In a dispute was hidden
to patrons of the Alcazar Theater
Flower Cotillon," and the figures sym
bolize the brief, joyous life of the flowers
in the summer sunshine, until shattered
and destroyed by storm. To develop this
idea she called In Bothwell Brown, a
young man who teaches "grace culture"
and other fads. Mr. Brown went into
raptures over the idea and sst about to
put it into execution. He taught the mem
bers of thÂ© company a few new wrinkles
in delsarte and pirouetting and then put
them through the mazes of this dance,
which an imaginative press agent says is
"life's allegory told in color and rhythm
and time and tune." So well did he suc
ceed that the dance in a measure over
shadowed the play. Miss Thompson, ap
preciating this, regretted that she had
ever seen Mr. Brown.
Miss Thompson, it Is alleged by Brown,
at the eleventh hour tried to cut out the
dance, and, being foiled, tried to mar it.
First she visited the back of the stage
before the play opened and cut down the
three yards of tin that is used in making
thunder. Next she removed the silk that
is bound around a churn that Is util
ized when the sound of gentle zephyrs
toying with a Populist's chin curtains is
needed. Then she bribed the man who
handles the cymbals, bass drum, kettle
drums and other "noises" in the storm
scene.
Georgie Cooper Lands a Solar Plexus.
When Mr. Bothwell Brown discovered
that the authoress was stealing his

LEADING FIGURES IN A COMEDY DRAMA THAT "WAS PLATED BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE ALCAZAR
THEATER ON MONDAY EVENING LAST, WHEN SOME REALISTIC ACTING "WAS HTDDEX FROM THE
VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE.
Ned Lannigan Is roundly abused and
vilified by the Republican bosses. It is
said that the fifteen Democratic votes
used to elect himself as a delegate to the
McNab-Phelan i convention would have
saved the day in the Forty-first District
for the allied bosses if the Lannigan Dem
ocrats had voted the Republican ticket.
Good citizens have one ray of hope.
The prize won by the bosses is so fat that
the winners are falling out over the divi
sion of the plunder. Kelly, becoming
ugly and aggressive, may get up in open
convention and speak the plain truth
about Herrin. The railroad organ, speak
ing for Herrin, may specify in detail its
reason for supporting: Kelly before the
election and kicking him, out afterward.
While Kelly's work is' raw, Herrin's is
deucedly. clumsy. Neither one Is smooth.
Johnny Mackenzie of San Jose,, whose
smoothness exceeds that of salad oil, has
been imported to manipulate the conven
tion. The advent of Jim Rea to help Kelly
and Sam Rainey would not surprise poli
ticians. The local bosses deeply deplore
the defeat of Max Goldberg. The grief
in the Primary League over Abe Ruef's
defeat is nothing compared with the dis
tress in the boss camp over the finish of
Goldberg's political career. The Primary
League elected 130 delegates to the con
vention and may be able to defeat the
scheme of allied bosses to sell the nomina
tions, g
There is talk of putting T. D. Riordan
\ forward for chairman of the convention.
His candidacy was announced yesterday.
Outside of boss circles there- is agitation
in favor of nominating Judge Slack for
Mayor. He is regarded as the ablest man
mentioned so far.
One Ray of Hope.
Martin Kelly having won the Republi
can convention at the primary election ex
pects to sell the nominations to the high
est bidders. The people were apprised of
Kelly's intention in this regard, but they
stayed away from the polls and permitted
the boss to win.
It is not conceivable that Crimmins
would think of deserting Kelly and going
to Herrin unless some great political or
pecuniary advantage was expected. The
contemplated change of companionship
cannot be accounted for on moral
grounds.
It is known that the relations between
Herrin and Kelly were once strained. The
estrangement grew out of the allotment of
boodle to influence Supervisors in the fix
ing of water rates. A manipulator other
than Kelly was selected to handle the
boodle. Kelly fancied thereafter that Her
rin had violated the principles of cour
tesy which should be maintained by traf
fic men. When Boss Kelly made his roar
in the B'nai B'rith Hall convention and
frightened his underlings into complete
subserviency for the rest of the session
the railroad organ assailed him in the
most intemperate 'terms. The organ
played "Kick Kelly Out," "Kelly Is an
Impostor" and "Kelly Is a Rascal," but
the tunes were played for the gallery.
Kelly stayed in. selected the Republican
County Committee, which the State or
ganization indorsed, and to show the push
that he could do something more rounded
up the San Francisco delegation to the
Legislature and ordered the indorsement
of "Corney" Pendleton for Speaker.
The flght In the camp of the Republican
bosses over the division of spoils Is , be
coming ugly. â¢ Boss Martin Kelly is ap
prised of secret plotting to undermine
him." The story comes to The Call that
Herrin has placed himself at the head of
the movement to wrest from Kelly the
fruits of the boss triumph at the polls
last Tuesday. The rumor is adroitly cir
culated that H. E. Huntlngton Is to be
restored to power in the Southern Pacific
and that under the re-established order of
affairs Herrin will be permitted to do poli
tics at the old stand. Phil Crimmins Is
urged to desert his old pal, Martin Kelly,
and join Herrin's forces. Last night the
assailants of Kelly in the camp" of cor
ruption were asserting that Crimmins had
â¢been detached from Kelly and would
henceforth train with the new crowd of
manipulators. Disinterested spectators of
the disgraceful controversy predict that
Kelly will bring Crimmins under his per
sonal lash and put a stop to Herrin's In
terference. Kelly has a way of dealing
with his underlings that proves quite ef
fective. Once before when Crimmins tried
to break away Kelly read the riot act and
read It with such vehemence and so dis
tinctly addressed It to his partner In per
son that the latter concluded that he
would rather stay where he was than go
to the hospital. When all other means
fail Kelly resorts to force. The flght may
become so hot that the bosses, losing cau
tion in anger, may expose one another in
open convention.

QITY CHEMIST GREENE reported
to the Coroner yesterday morning
that Ue had found carbo'ls acid
In tbe etomach of Hervey B. Van
derhoof, -president of the Syndi-
saturated with carbolic add. This fact
he carefully suppressed In his written re
port on file at the Coroner's office, which
stated that death was due probaDly to
heart disease, but he left a note for the
autopsy surgeon mentioning the handker
chief. The note was received by Dr.
Bacigalupi when he had almost completed
the autopsy, and after he had decided to
send the stomach to the chemist because
he had found evidences of corrosive poi

Coroner Leland Is very much annoyed
over the Incident, as he seemingly has no

carelessness or* stupidity of his- deputies,
who were appointed by Gavin McNab and
