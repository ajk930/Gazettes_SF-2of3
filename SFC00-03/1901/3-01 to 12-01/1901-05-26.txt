val, there is always something doing. It
has no half ways with It. There is among
the/members all of. that esprit ; da corps
which makes the union between eoOeg*
boys closer than \ the ties of kin." In fact,
they could never enter into their work
so heartily if there were not the boylsa
spirit there. In giving to tha young ther*
is always an added pleasure. No srwh

boys and girls of troplo Porto Rico as

But Lafayette Post, having accom-^
pllshed this much,, does not feel further
inclined to influence legislation. To set
the youthful minds upon high Ideals
through the flag work is their favorite .
Â¦method. This branch of the post's. ser-,

Besides, there Is -no easier way to get

ard knows no peace; he is always in a
state of. terror and alarm, which is worse
than that of actual battle, for it is the

times worse than the reality.

they have almost lost their color, but.
Breathes there the roan, with soul so dead,
"Who never to himself hath eaid.

If such there breathe, eo, mark him well â
That last line tells the work of the post.
To the border lines of the country, to the
slums of the city, anywhere that the
breeze of patriotism too faintly stirs the
flag, the members of Lafayette go with
bunting prepared and speeches impromptu
to fan the spark of country love.
Buying flags and presenting them to
schools, sending new flags to Cuba, Porto
Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines, haa
been the fad of Lafayette Post.
Its members have constituted them
selves missionaries of the Star-Spangled
Banner. "Wherever fate or the fortunes of
war have carried the flag metaphorically
they have carried in reality the starred
banting; hoisted it with their own hands
to the sight of eyes that had never before
rested upon It; waved It over heads into
which entered no comprehension- of Its
meaning, and then Â» laboriously, taught
them what it meant and how to treat it
and salute it ; .
A piiy it Is" that all of, this good work
sbosld go so far afield. There are many,
cf us who think we know the flag. vlÂ»o
have never yet felt under it one genuine
thrill of patriotism of the kind that the
American traveler in a far and troubled
land feels at Its sight.
An Instance of this, to show what flag
hunger, country home-sickness, can be. ' '
A petite Californienne living not long In
her native State went with her parents to
Australia. Having been there some time
she was one day found In the front parlor
of a neighbor's house, tearing her lace
bonnet to pieces In frantic effort to get
It off her head. The lady inquired the
reason.
"There It is," she said. "I>on't *oo see
It? There's the flag. Take off 'oo hat.
Do<5 b'ess Stars and Stripes!"
Those ideas were not of course original
In her own little head, but they showed
how strong must have been the feelings
cf those about her. and how often ex
pressed, in order to impress her so forci
bly with that patriotism which -we at
home never know.
To kaow and to love the flag and what
It represents is not all; there must also
be the ability to defend It. Without that
possession, love of the flag would but
cause pain and might become a mockery.
Lafayette Post knows that what the
thousand years past have been the thou
sand years to come will be.
Wars grow greater rather, than less.
The men of the G. A. R. saw the greatest
battles the world ever knew. Ther saw
more men fall on one field than iSnglanf i
has lost In all the battles she has had
irlnee that of Trafalgar.
The men of peace say that this can
never again be, for the world has become
more civilized. But do they remember too
that we are Just now engaged in stirring
op the uncivilized part of the world?
That by the way is still the largest.
After teaching the love for :ne flag.'
there naturally follows the military In
struction. To this end, Lefavette Tost
has worked in Congress until it secured
during the last cession a law which v/an
almost unnoticed at the time, but trill
bar* a great. Influence In molding the
<5<-Btiry of the country.
The act itself was recently read ' at a
meeting of General Thomas Post, by
Comrade Joseph Blasebeck, sergeant
major of Lafayette Post, who is at pres
ent In Ban Francisco on business con
nected with the G. A. R.
ThÂ« provision* of the act are, in sub
stance, that hereafter any organized In
stitution of learning may, by applying to
thÂ« War Department, be furnished with a
military instructor detailed from the reg
ular army, who shall reside at and give
all of his time to the school.
It haÂ» heretofore been the custom of the
Department of War to extend this favor
to schools applying, as in the case with
our own University of California, but it
has been merely a voluntary courtesy, ;
Now, through the good offices of La
fayette Post In securing the passage of
the bill, the War Department is compelled
to supply an instructor to any school, col
lege or academy which will comply with
the regulations provided and pay thaex- '

The Way to Conduct a Church Wedding
The other style of wedding Is for the
ushers to precede the party up the alslo
till, they reach the front pew; they then
separate \ and stand on ; each side of the
aisle two pews apart, allowing ; brides
maids to pass through j into the chancel,
â¢ where they form a grouping, leaving room
for the ushers In the background. : The
maid of honor, follows and stands on the
left, close to the., altar rail. The groom,
who is waiting with the best man at tho
chancel steps, then steps. forward and
takes the bride's hand and leads her to
the altar, where they should kneel for a
moment.
The gentleman who Is to give away the
bride and the best man. follow after, the
best man going to the right of groom and
the gentleman who is to give- the brlda
stands directly back : of her. Then tho
ushers follow, going to right and left back
of the bridesmaids. ., 1
After the benediction, and while th*
maid of honor is arranging .the veil, tho
gentleman who gave away, the bride can
descend- from the chancel and enter the
first; pew,- or if desired he; can step aside
and allow bride and groom, maid of honor
and bridesmaids to pass and he can wall;
with the best man, followed by the ushers."

THE most beautiful and Impressive
ceremony in the Episcopal church Is
to have the betrothal at the chancel
steps. This way renders it unneces-.
Bary for the bride to kneel till the bene
diction, which is very desirable, as it is
troublesome to do so in a wedding gown.
It also allows the gentleman who is to
give away the bride a chance to enter the
front pew, thus saving him from having
to ascend and descend from the chancel,
and also leaves him out of the recessional!
The prettiest way to arrange this style
of a wedding is for the ushers, brides
maids,'flower girls or pages to precedo
the couple up the aisle into the chancel,
separating to rlsht and left and then
forming a group, avoiding straight lines
and facing the congregation. The maid of
honor then stops on the left of the chaii
. eel step opposite the best man, who should
be there with the groom. The groom thci
steps fqrward and takes the bride's hand,
who at the same moment lets go of the
arm of the gentleman who is to give her
away, he remaining directly-back of her.

a eame of chance. The game endod last

off the list as uninsurable.
The Pactolus sighted the John McDon

ships were brothers. They had not seen
each other for ten â¢ years. The vessels
drew up and the brothers went; on board
each other's ships. They were both bound

THE winter Just passed fcas proved
one of the most disastrous in the
annals of our merchant marine.
"The Pacific Ocean," declares an
old salt, "has forfeited her right
to her peaceful name by the way she has
tcted this last winter."
During the months of November and
December and the early part of January
furious gales raged not only off this coast
of the Pacific but off the Japan coast as
well.
A record of disasters of the Pacific Is
kept at our Merchants" Exchanga In It
you will find stories of wreck and horror,
loss of life and miraculous escapes, of
ehips that have never been heard from
efter clearing portâ others which have
caught fire during terrific sales, and some
that have been spoken, but never reached
their haven; accounts of dismantled and
dismasted hulks, which have put back
Into port for repairs after battling for
days and weeks without getting- one hun
dred miles away.
Many bound for other ports have comÂ©
Into our harbor in distressâ warpfd,
leaky, rudderless and inoperativeâ mute
witnesses of the rigor and might of our
yeaeeful sea.
This calamity book disposes of an acci
dent in a few words; and yetUhe disaster
record of our last winter covers . many
papes. And full of weird interest it is,

Here are a few accounts of the dis
tressed ships that have entered this port
durimr the past winter:
Decrmber 26, 1000. the British ship
Cro.martvshire put in from Astoria with
a. cargo "of wheat and barley. December
15 she encountered a terrific sea, which
threrv her on beam end, her starboard
cide being completely submerged. Three
thousand bags of fcarjey were jettisoned
to right her and still she listed 40 degrees
when she entered the harbor. The crew
was working neck high In water, but re
mained at the pumps until the moment ot
lai.dingr.
The misfortunes of the 'United States
transport Sherman are Interesting. â¢ From
her logbook we learn that on December
17 she struck a typhoon which tore'off the
roof of the staterooms on the hurricane
deck, twisting the iron stanchions and
Jamming the roof up against the smoke
stack. '
Early last fall the German bark J. C.
Pfluger. Captain Hoover, bound for
<3ueenstown, put back in distress. About
110 miles south-southwest of San Fran
cisco ehe struck a whirlwind. Her main
topmast and main topgallant mast, lower,
mizzen and topmasts were carried away.
In Jailing they smashed two small boats
and ekids. Her logbook says that it took
the crew nine hours to clear away tho
â¢wreckage. "Bent a new foresail," the log
continued* "and laid a course for the
coast to reach nearest port. Drifted down
coast at 6 a. m. past Point Conception
with signals set for assistance. Picked up
by eteamer Greenwood ten miles off the
Santa Barbara coast and was towed into
port at Santa Barbara."
She remained there five days and was
finally towed into our harbor by the tug:
Relief. She- was repaired anil sent' out
again to face the mighty Pacific. In a
few. weeks she came limping back into
port dismasted, her cargo of Hour darn
aged by a leak In her hold. She was then
given up by her owners and soM at public
auction at the Merchants' Exchange for
$15,250. . â¢ Â¦
About this time the steamer W. H. Km-,
ger, bound from San Francisco to Santa
Barbara, while "^nterlne the Santa . Bar
bara channel, was caught in a gale from
the southwest, and driven twenty miles
from shore. She sprung a leak Â¦while bat
tling against the gale and listed at an
angle of 45 degrees. She seemed about to
turn turtle. They jettisoned 150,000 feet of
lumber to right her. She was towed into
San Francisco harbor and taken to the dry
dock for repairs.
The steamer South Portland caught flre
â¢while unloading her (cargo of lime at the
Pacific-street wharf. It was raining.
Some of her hatches N were open, the
lime caught fire and the San Francisco
fire department was called and finally
sank the vessel. Later five tugs tried In.
vain to pull her up. Finally she was raised
by the wrecker "Whitelaw, with much dif
ficulty. She was taken to the dry dock lor Â»
repairs and then sent into the northern
trade.
The early fall records the disaster of
the May Flint, which, on September 9, en
tered and sailed down the harbor at 8
o'clock p. m. She was loaded with coal
from Nanaimo. The water front was all
aglow and the bay was illuminated, for
California was celebrating her fiftieth an
niversary as a State and the bay Â¦was as
light as day. The May Flint saw the bat
tleship Iowa ahead, but she did not know
that the Iowa had a long ram projecting
forward. In .turning to pass the Iowa she
ran against this ram, hit the Vidette and
immediately sank from sight with her
cargo.
November 9 the British ship Flintshire
Cut into our harbor in distress. "The wind
lew a gale off Point Bonita," the record
states, "which washed away the life
boats and wrecked the starboard fore
castleâwashed off everything portable
from the decks. Hurricane and terrific sea
continued: all hands employed cutting
away Â¦ wreckage; used oil to keen sea
down." . Â¦ .
Many mariners were wrecked outside
the heads and along the coast before they
could reach a harbor.
The steamer Cleone, bound from San
Francisco to Eureka, was driven ashorÂ©
December 7, near Point Gorda. The cao
tain and crew were compelled to abandon
her. ' She floated off at high tide and was
last seen, badly -water-logged, about five
miles from Point Gorda.*
Danger has . made playthings .of, thÂ©
ships of the PaciflcXSome, in her wrath,

the point of destruction have been miracu-

off the Horn and went around by way of

September 19. Â¦ ,..--'_ Â¦ Â¦' - _â¢Â¦:Â¦Â¦
She is -a. well-built steel ship, In charge
of a veteran navigator. She carries a car
go of coal, and the only danger appre
hended by these sanguine ?'gamblers' Is
that a fire might have caught in her hold.
The safe arrival of the French, bark
Grand Duchess Olga ended a neat little
insurance gamble in this city. She left
here many months ago and was compelled
to put into Tahiti, dismasted and leaking.
"While she was in the land of the over
dues an unknown vessel was reported, on
the reefs lnvthe South Seas. Many thought
It was the French bark. The commercial
market was . astir. Now that she has
landed It is still astir, for the question is
now: What missing, vessel . is It that

a cargo, of lumber., Â¦ Captain Donelly and
wife were on board. Nothing has ever
been seen of the. Monitor from' the .time
she left Grays Harbor. , Â¦-.:?Â¦'; , ;Â¦- .' .
The most mysterious disappearance of
the winter was that of the bark Andrada,
She sailed from Santa Rosalia, Mexico,
November 12, 1D00, : destined for Portland,
Or. She was a steel bark of almost 3000
tons register and was well fitted. to com
bat the fiercest storms. She was built in
1891 and was owned by the Andrada Sail
ing Ship Company- of. England. ' .
Severe' storms raged at intervals along
the coast, but when the Andrada Â¦ : ap
proached the mouth of the Columbia Riv
er there was a comparative, calm. Pilot
Cordina ) of Astoria boarded her and ; al
most immediately a gale sprung up and
drove her northward out to sea, never to
return. That was . on December 11, and
ship,- crew and. pilot are yet. to ;be heard

. . Fully as mysterious a fate as the An
drada is shared by the Rathdown, another
British, ship. Captain H. W. Dyke. -She
also was made of steel and registered 2058
tons. October 4 she sailed in light ballast
from- /Yokohama. Her charter Â¦, read,

from quotation as not relnsurable. Boon,
after she was posted at Lloyd's as miss-
Ing, and the underwriters have settled
with her owners for. her, as they have also
for the Andrada. - . '
The British bark Bertha, 2985 tons,, is the
third that the. Pacific storms have swal
lowed. She also was a stanch steel ship,
but steel and iron, earth's strongest met
als, .were held- in derision last .winter by
the relentless Pacific.
Â¦ The Bertha, Captain Brunings. sailed
from Honolulu October 24, for Portland,
in light ballast. What became- of her none
will ever know until the ocean gives up
it3 dead. She was quoted at 90 per cent
for -months, but none cared to buy her to
arrive. Now she is posted at Lloyd's as
missing. ' _
The British "bark Cape Urath, 199S tons
register, Captain Hart, left Callao on No
vember^ for Astoria, Or. Her story will
never be written save as it Is summed up
in the brief word "missing.',' -
On January 24 a " vessel I was spoken off
the mouth of the Columbia River, but as
nothing - more -'was- heard concerning it,'
some mariners have concluded .that the re
ported speaking was, an error; others hold
to the belief that it was the Cape Urath,
and that she was swept northward in the
storm and' shared ; the same fate as the
Â¦Ancirada. â¢ * .-Â¦Â¦Â¦
-A thrilling novel of adventure and dan
ger could, be woven about the Pyrenees,
which was burned at sea.
â¢ The Pyrenees was a British four-mast
ed" steel bark of 2169 tons register. She
sailed from Tacoma October 14, with a
cargo of barley and: wheat for England,
valued; at- $78,784. The first week in' No
vember she encountered a hurricane gale
in' midocean. i In trying to combat" It she
was driven far off her course. While the

"While thla tronical storm was ruling

ord also shows wreck after wreck.
The Pacific Steamship . Company's
floating palace. City of Topeka; bound
from Skaguay to Seattle, was wrecked
off the Alaskan coast. ' . Â¦
Her. log describes the storm as "one of
the worst gales Jinown in the north, a
terrific wind accompanied by a blinding

high and navigation was impossible." She
was deserted by. her 'passengers and crew.
Just one week later, on December 15,
the steamer Alpha, bound for Yokohama,
en route from Victoria. B. C, was totally
wrecked on the reels off Union Bay.
Eight lives were lost, Including tho
managing owner, the captain, the purser,
the first and second engineers, two ' ablÂ»
seamen and an unknown stowaway.
A furious gale was raging. In the dark
ness she ran on the. rocks .in Baynea

groaned and creaked her warning to the

The ill-fated 'Alpha made onÂ© start sev

put into Victoria with a broken feed-pipe

number of her officers and crew deserted,
declaring that she was unseaworthy.
Her chief engineer was among the,de
serters.' He was sentenced to six months
in jail and was serving his time 'when thÂ«
Alpha was wrecked.
The Lane, also a Nome trading steam

she came back for repairs the men In thÂ«
engine-room- were working In water to
their waists; and the water had become,
so heated from contact with the boil
ers that the engine-room was filled with
suffocating steam. .
Great consternation was felt for thÂ«
ship Ardnamurchan. She left Vancouver
bound â¢ for Liverpool with a cargo of
salmon. Some days afterward a num
ber of cases of salmon were washed up
on the Oregon coast. These cases wera
of that particular brand carried by thev
Ardnamurchan, and when nothing 'was
heard from her mariners took this as
evidence that she was lost. On April 12.
when she was out 140 days, she was
spoken. Later she landed and discharged
her cargo, and the faces of the gamblers
of the Pacific fell, as did also their finan

<&y^ US. LUCY CLEAVER McELROY, the author of "Juletty," was
J/Y(\ Â¦ *> orn in Lebanon, Ky , and has lived all j her life in that State.
*~. ~ir Her^recent book, which is reviewed on another part of this page,
is ali the"' more* remarkable when' we consider that the greater part of it
was writte^ffrom the bed of an invalid. As a girl Mrs. HcElroy joined
in all her father's sports and lived "&n out-of-doors life. This manner of
living she .kept ''. up after hsr marriage, and it. was while riding., to
founds, with her husband that she -was thrown from her horse and made
an invalid for life. She wrote "Juletty" under the most trying of cir
cumstances. While the author lay en her back or when scarce , able to
hold a pen, she picked out the words with one " hand on a typewriter.
Yet her writing is decidedly the reverse from morbid, a3 such a deplor
able state of health would warrant. She writes with a fullness of life and
joyousness that any lover of field sports might envy. "*- ;
MRS. LUCY CLEAVER McELORY.
brother of the great raider. Morgan,
which, though not a part of- the present
T7 T is almost impossible to believe that
so bright and cheery a novel as
II "Juletty" could be from the pen of an
invalid. It breathes of the field, of the
hunt, of the life and deeds of strong men
and women; and although it has its tragic
Kide, still there is not one touch of the
morbidity that generally comes from the
sickroom. j . .
Mrs. Lucy Cleaver- McElroy knows her
Kentucky and its people well. Her types
are drawn with a skilled hand and her
'scene for the action of the story is well
selected. The "Pennyrile" district, with
its mountains and forests, its ponds and
streams, and the mysterious caves, gives
the ideal place for the moonshiner with
his still of "mountain dew." For Mrs.'
McElroy's story concerns itself with the
adventures of a United States Marshal
and his last effort against moonshiners.
This attempt results fatally, but not in
that sense of the word fatal generally
accepted. The author cleverly reserves
until the last page her final surpriseâ and
it is worth waitine for.
The United States Marshal, son of 1 old
Kentucky mountain stock, tells the r.tory
himself; possibly for this reason he does
not make exactly the ideal hero. It is
hard for the truly heroic to keep center
et&ge fot themselves and do it gracefully.
In any event, the characters of the men
who show out most strikingly are those
ox- the grandfather and of Juletty's
cousin, Al Lincaue.
The grandfather is a distinct and fine
type. Rough as an uncut diamond, a
evrearer of prodigious oaths, constantly
grumbling, and yet with his hand ever
in his pocket to help the poor or his arm
always ready to strike for a friend.
Although Al Lincque occupies the un
enviable role of villain, be is of the mold
that goes to make heroes. His is the hand
that does most for the illicit still and
comes very near being the death of our
revenue onlcer, yet his is the arm also
that eaves Juletty from death. His na
ture is so great and so self-sacrificing that
he gives up the woman he loves because
he realizes he has not the education nor
refinement sufficient to be her mate. Al
though we know that he is in the wrong
and that had he lived he would have
taken human life without compunction,
etill we cannot but admire this honest,
rug-ged nature which is true and consist
ent to Its own standards, but not accord
ins to the conventions of a Christian
world.
There are not a great number of char
acters: In the book, but all of them pos
sess distinctive Individuality.
Old Mitch, the devoted servant of the
grandfather, is a study in himself. He
lias his own opinions on the matter of
illicit distilleries and it is amusing to see
him helping his master's grandson to ex
plore the caves in a search for contraband
liquor when all the time he himself is one
of the helpers in the still and is having
a quiet little laugh at what he considers
honest deception. Regarding moonshiners
the author says:
"To the illicit distiller of Kentucky law
is simply an autocratic usurpation of
lKiwer.by a wayward but powerful set of
men. His idea Is that every man. should
be a law unto himself, controlling, de
lending and caring for his own, and devil
take the weakest. He considers it meri
torious when he evades or thwarts such
'tyranny,' or expressed in the language of
tbe denant moonshiner:
" 'Don't nothin' pay in Kentucky sence .
ever* durned nigger's got er crap uv some
thin* cr nother. Ev* white man's fam
blcy's gotter live, an' er heap uv 'em can't
make both ends meet no "way 'cep'in'
makin' er leetle brandy.' "
The story begins with a snap right from
the start. One of tbe Kentucky moun
taineers whose distant relative has been
interfered with by our friend the Mar-
Ehal puts a bullet through that officer's
arm with no other remark than the cool
drawl: â¢
"Thar, dam yer!"
"Take thet, an* nex* time doncher be so
dam smart!"
The young man goes to his grandfath
er's home in the mountains to recuperate
and there finds evidences of a large still
in the neighborhood. He is not now on
duty; nevertheless the whiff of a whisky
scent is manna to his detective nostrils
and he cannot help laying plans to cap
ture the outfit.
He again meets Juletty. an early flame
of his, and finds her even more beautiful
than in the early days when as a boy
on the plantation he had given her a
lover's rinff. Â¦ -^.
Â¦ The connection between the hero's love
for Juletty and his desire to capture the
chief of the moonshiners is closer than
he deems and the intricacies of the de
velopments which crowd Into his life make
breathless reading. â¢'-C;
There are several chapters which are
not in a strict sense part of the story as
a romance, yet for local color and atmos
phere, they play an important part. One
is the lynching of a negro after an excit
ing chase with bloodhounds. A descrip
tion of this kind is a delicate matter to
handle. It is so apt to be overdrawn or
lurid, but In this instance it is (presented
as a reality and without the slightest ef
fort at gallery play.
Another fine bit of description is that
of the fox" hunt, which tells of the old
master of hunt who can " say , from tho
baying of his Â¦ dogs Just when the . game
Is started and where it Â¦ is. One chapter
â¢tells of the death of young Tom Morgan,
ing from the press of Mr. Russell and
will 'Â¦ prove very .welcome to readers and
lovers of the stage, who can now obtain
them in a permanent form. The volume
has been given a durable and attractive
bindingâ otherwise ibe souvenirs which
go to make up its contents are the same
as those issued with paper, cover. ,
The first set in the book is Maude
Adams in "L'AIglon." with fine reproduc
tions of the most dramatic scenes of the
play and excellent portraits of Miss
Adams.-
Next is given a series of views of Mary
Mannering as Janice Meredith. When one
sees through th|< pictures the charming
personality and womanly grace of MIs3
Mannering it is not to be wondered at
her success.
Another dramatization of a popular his
torical novel is given in John Drew as
Richard Carvel. All these pictures have
a double Interest for they not only per
petuate excellent likenesses and poses of
leading stage favorites, but they serve as
mental reminders of" the most striking
scenes In the best fiction of the, day. Â¦
An interesting series of views follows
of Annie Russell in "A Royal Family,"
as produced at the Lyceum Theater, New
York.
A splendid series of character studies
shows William GlHette as Sherlock
Holmes. Mr. Gillette certainly looks the
part as well as he acts it. He has the
ideal type of face for the hero of. Mr.
Doyle's novelâ the square, strong face and
searching eyes. . â¢. Â¦
Julia Marlowe' appears ln "When
Knighthood Was in Flower," and there
is. also given a collection of pictures rep
resenting Miss ; Marlowe in others of her
most notable impersonations. '= There is a
charming portrait . of '.her. as â¢ Barbara
Frietchie, one as Colinette, as Viola, as
Juliet, as Lydia Languish, as Constance,
and then some haif-dozen smaller pho
tographs of other roles.
The. three-act comedy of "Brother Ofil
cers", also receives some epace.
One of the most interesting parts of tho
volume Is that devoted to Miss Nethersole
in some of the characters of her reper
toire. In addition to half-tone reproduc
tions of photographs are given some ar-.
tistic drawings of her by C. Allan Gilbert,
Malcolm Strauss Jind Forrest Halsey.
Strauss has a splendid head of her done
in charcoal, but tha full-length portrait
from life by '. Forrest Halsey . of '-: Miss
Nethersole as Fanny le Grand in "Sapho"
is really worth cutting out and framing
only that it would be a shame to mutilate

In the section devoted to Maude. Adam3

contributes some fine studies and ther?
is a head by Ernest Haskell and a full

The Bohemian.
The Bohemian, a little magazine that
lives up to its name, enters with June on
the first number of its second volume.
This number should prove a good begin
ning for a new year. Though its stories
arc not long, they all possess [ the merit
of exceptional strength and interest. The
first one of the present issue is a sketch
by William Arnold, "An Olive
in which occurs a brief but pointed dia-.
logue between a young couple that decid
ed on their marriage day to. keep their
individual friends and live a f life of inde
pendence. â¢ An incident has Â¦ Â¦ happened
which shows that the scheme i is not at
all times practicable and the path of true
love s"eems on the verge of obliteration,
but the author cleverly sets all right with
quits an artistic touch. Â£ . Â¦, Â¦:"â¢-Â¦
"Number 19," by S. .L. Bacon, is a long
stcry condensed in four short pages. The
climax is not just what' the reader ex
pects, but the sketch as a whole' probably
gains strength through that very point.
"When Rivals Meet," by, Edward Pay
son Jackson and Everit Bogert Terhune,
tells in dialogue of the love of Pierre and
Jean for the cay Lisette. .. It is Bohemian
Paris done to a turn. The rivals meet
Just as they are about to try another
'vcrld through the medium > of a rope's
r.oose. and their decision to make merry
v/ith the flowing bowl' instead of ' resting
in suicides' graves is quite characteris
tically French. , :
"A Blasphemous Christian" is a well
told incident in the life of a newspaper
publisher, who meets his temptation, but
is strong under the test. â¢
The Bohemian is filled with complete
stories of this kind that are just the thing
for short reading when there is not time'
nor. inclination offered for the perusal of
a book. The pages are further lightened
with good verses: This little magazine
as an artistic and literary success is de
seivlng of a prosperous new year and will
doubtless make many friends.

Of. necessity, we must pass over many
points which Mr. Vincent "dwells upon
with' interest, such as Corneille's short
membership" among the famous' "five au
thors" engaged by Richelieu to collaborate
and Jointly produce dramas under his
patronage In the salle du theater of the
Palais Cardinal. Of his private life little
is known. He seems. to hav^appeared sel
dom in the social life of his period/being
shy and, In spite of his long residence in
Paris, something of a provincial: â¢ That
the criticism of his own day, and even of
the present day, has often been adverse
and even harsh cannot be denied,. yet Cor
neille may justly be called the father of
the higher French drama. (Price $1 each.)
After the publication of "The, Cid,"
which at this distant date is still popular
ly accepted as the cornerstone â¢ for the
wealth of real dramatic literature that
has followedâ indeed, Moliere freely con
fesses that but for Corneille 1 s guidance ho
might -never have acomplished his own
masterpieces âCorneille wrote many
dramas, the most noteworthy of which
was perhaps "Horace." . It was in' the
Galerie du Palais that Corneille first origi
nated the idea of realism in scenery upon
the stage.
The poet was only 23 when he wrote his
first play,."Melite ou les Fausses Lettres,"
a comedy in five acts, and in verse. The
chief work which threw upon Corneille
the bright light of public interest was his
drama of "The Cid," taken from the
Spanish legend repeated to him by M. de
Chalon, one time secretary to , Marie de
Medlcis. But if this drama brought him
much glory, it brought him, at the same
lime much censure, for Richelieu, who
was himself an ardent worshipper of the
muse and was known to write also, as
well as many other of the minor poets
and dramatists, grew jealous of his suc
cess, and there ensued such a war of
abusive pamphlets as has never been seen
In France since. An attacK more venom
ous than any of its predecessors, and
signed by George de Scudery, a brother of
Madelaine de Scudery, one of the pre
cieuses who flourished at that time,
brought, forth the intercession of Riche
lieu. He urged that the judgment of the
French Academy be brought to bear upon
the Â¦work. Corneille reluctantly consented
to submit the drama to their mercies, and
after a careful and minute study of the
play their opinion was renderedâ by 'no
means complimentary, yet far more len
ient than Â¦ the Cardinal might haye de
sired.
Pierre Corneille, one of the earliest of
the French dramatists, and also a member
(although in late life) of the Academie
Francalse, lived "also in the seventeenth
century, having been born at Rouen in
1606. At 18 he was admitted to the . bar,
but although for twenty years he prac
ticed law, the' work was ever uncongenial,
and he joyfully resigned it.
That the Academie Francaise has out
lived two centuries speaks well for the
firm rock upon which it was founded. It
has passed safely through the crisis of the
French revolution, and to-day is an inde
pendent institution, representing the high
est and best culture of France.
These, preliminaries being settled, the
academy set Itself to the execution of its
main object, that of preparing a diction
ary, a grammar, a treatise on. rhetoric,
and one on poetry. It would be interest
ing to follow Mr. Vincent in his clear
summary of the trials and vicissitudes ex
perienced' during the progress of these
undertakings, t Only the dictionary has
ever seen the light of day, the first edi
tion of that not appearing, however, until
16S4.
What,, if anything, might have come of
this ideal association had not Bois-Robert,
a favorite of Richelieu, been admitted
into its circle can scarcely be imagined.
It was, however, through his influence
and much against the desires of the main
body of the society that the Cardinal be
came interested in the enterprise and ex
tended not only his patronage but his
offer to have conferred upon it, through
his influence, letters patent, making it a
public institution.- In spite of what might
have been the individual wishes of the
members, this offer was acceptedâbe
cause it could not well be refused â and ln
363a the -Academic Francalse became an
established fact with Richelieu at Its
head. ;
The meetings were no longer marked by
the delightful informality of earlier days. '
To give "order and form" to them, the
academicians provided themselves with Â¦
officers, consisting of a director and a j
chancellor, to be chosen by lot for a; term'
of two months" each; a secretary, to be
chosen by ballot, and to hold thq position
for life, the entire membership to include
forty. -.
Certain it is that in 1629, at the house
of M. Valentin Conrart, a young man liv
ing in the Rue des Viellies-Etuves, near
Rue Saint Martin, the eight members of
the French Academy first met. The meet
ings were held once a week in the after
noons, and were carried on with all the
informality of a gathering of friends.
There were no Â¦ parliamentary restrictions
or binding rules to adhere to. The mem
bers were nearly all of the same sopial
gradeâ that is, from, the middle class
were all devoted to the French language,
and' zealous to improve it and their own
usise of it. .
In "The French Academy" Mr. Vincent
gives a clear account of its origin, which
he ascribes largely to the Influence of
the Hotel de Rambouillet and the conver
sations that took place in its blue room,
although the honor, he says, must prob
ably be shared with Malherbe. Malherbe
held literary court in . an ill furnished
apartment and was known as the "tyrant
of words and syllables." -
I<eon H. Vincent has written two more
books of interest to students of French
literature, which will' be appreciated by
those who enjoyed his excellent work of
last year on the Hotel de Rambouillet.
These volumes are published by Hough
ton, Mifflin & Co., Boston, and are "The
French Academy" and "Pierre Corneille."
Mr. Vincent does pretend to have
given exhaustive histories in these books,
but they contain much of interest and in
formation to the student of literature in
France during the sixteenth and seven
teenth centuries. At the end of each
work is given a bibliographical appendix,'
which gives a list of the best books for
the further Information of those who
would go deeper into the subjects.

Frederick Palmer, whose vigorous

Harper & Brothers have secured for the
July issue of their "American Contem
porary Novels" series a first book by a
new writer of unusual and striking im
portance. "The Manager of the B. &
A.," by Vaughan Kester, is said to be a
remarkable performance for a first work
of fiction by a young writer. It Is also
refreshing to learn * that this novel ia
more concerned with the romance of busi
ness, than with the pale sentimentality
that takes the place of genuine passion
in so much of the fiction of to-day. Mr.
Kester contributed a short story called
"The Mills of the Little Tin Gods" to the
Cosmopolitan, about three years ago,
which attracted marked attention at the
time, x and evoked comment , from more
than one eminent critic. There was an
indication in that story that Mr. Kester
"sensed," so to speak, the feeling and at
mosphere of business life as few have
done it, and there was the promise that
if he developed this peculiar sensibility
ho would achieve something in a field
which to-day presents, in our country at
least, one of the most fruitful .for the
young novelist. "The Manager of the B.
& A." Is said to be a- further evidence of
Mr. Kester's power in the right direction.
The scene of the story is laid in a little
tewn in the lumber region of Michigan,
and the hero is the manager of a small
branch railroad which is on the verge oC
bankruptcy when he takes charge of it.
The plot of the story Is original, and sit
uation follows situation in rapid succes
sion in the trying experiences which the
manager of the B. & A. has to undergo
in his efforts to build up the road and in-
promptly, but he was sent out as war cor
respondent. He foretold the fact that the
Greeks were so ill prepared tor war that
they were practically defeated <jÂ«fore a
shot . was fired. His cruick perception of
what was almost grotesque in Greece'3
method of making: ready for tha struggle
did much to make the mind of the public
familiar with the vital fact that the
Greeks of to-day were not the Greeks of
Thermopylae.
Palmer accompanied the Greek army,
saw the early, battle from the trenches
where he lay with the Grtek*%oldlers. and
finally, when ' the battle of Volo was
fought and decided so disastrously to the
Greeks, he rode as hard as he could ride
to the sea and sent his paper a cable dis
patch which turned out to be one of the
great news "beats" of the year.
At the close of the war he returned to
London and resumed his correspondence.,
from which, however, he Â¦was called to
America to make a 'Journey into the mys
terious Klondike country. He got there so
quickly and traveled so- lightly wjuipped.
carrying only the most, necessary articles,
that he managed to get over the route and
back again before most other correspon
dents were fairly started. Ho was thus
able to relate the first reallr authentic
story. - of the Klondike, describing with,
precision the various routes and trails and
the extreme 'difficulties of the gold hunt
long before others had authoritative tales
to telL
When' Palmer got back from the Klon
dike the war with Spain was practically
ended. However, he started Immediately
for the Philippines, where he saw a great
deal of the early fighting 1 with the insur
gents, and when the Chinese trouble
broke out he left Manila Immediately for
the scene and accompanied the relief col
umn on its memorable march to Peking.
It was in these experiences that Palmer
gained his knowledge of men and war.
The experience of the Greek war enabled
him to see with understanding eyes the
operations of the Philippine war. Hav
ing already laid his foundation be was
able to devote much of his time to the
study of men and women and -the social
and other minor aspects of the nation at
war. In this way he made- the studies
which have resulted In the delightful
stories which are finding how so large an
audience. " Â¦ " Â¦ ?â¢ .

THE east wind â¢was blowing in fitful
gusts off the distant desert as Ra
mon Velasco slowly rode through
the gateway of the Rancho del Mar
and set his face in the direction of
the San Jacinto Hills. His present spirit
less demeanor was decidedly inconsistent
with his usual impetuous temperament.
So remarkable, In fact, was the circum
stance that the small army of peons in the
adjacent hay fields paused in the midst of
their sluggish labor and stood gazing in
Ill-concealed wonderment after the fa-,
millar figure of the retreating caballcro.
They noted with mingled approval and
disparagement the fretful protest of the
sprightly mountain pony, and the Iron
hand of the master that restrained him
from dashing away at his wonted speed.
But Velasco paid no heed to the Idle
scrutiny of the harvesters. With his wide
sombrero tilted dewn over his eyes and
chin resting dejectedly in the hollow of
the silver crescent at the throat of his
broldered leather tunic, he jogged list
lessly onward, his every thought seeming
ly concentrated upon the broad horn of
his vaquero saddle. But, in truth, Velasco
was as oblivious of that circular expanse
cf rawhide as of any other of his imme
diate surroun lir.gs. What his thoughts
actually dwelt upon was his recent inter
view with Don Felipe Ortega, the patron
of the Rancho eel Mar.
This had not been his first visit to the
luxurious old casa de campo. It was two
years since he had led his troop of hardy
rurales across the rugged Sierra Madres,
whose blue peaks were just discernible,
against the far horizon, to occupy the sta
tion assigned him on the Sonora frontier.
And during the interval he -had been a
frequent guest of the Ortegas. In fact,
never a week had gone by, barring the
several occasions when he had been ab
sent with his command in their meteoric
raids upon the recreant Yaquis, but what
the valiant young captain had ridden
down from his post in the San Jacinto
Hills to epend -an afternoon and evening
at the rancho. And this week he had
twice been a visitor witnin its gates; for
only the evening before he had stood out-
Bide a certain barred casement wherein
sat Dona Inez, the most charming of Don
Felipe's pretty daughters, and unfolded
to her a secret -thrft for months he had
been nerving himself to reveal.
Ere now he had led his doughty riders
Into many a bloody fray, but this, he told
himself, was the one brave act of his life
â the only time he had ever been brought
face to face with fear". And he had wonâ
won the gentle senorita's consent to ask
ner father for her hand.
But at the same time she had told him
something that had occasioned her many
a doubt and apprehension, and which was
that another suitor had. contrary to her
â¢will, already laid Biege to Don Felipe's
ear; and that suitor was none other than
young Don Ricardo Sanchez, the heir to
the great Hacienda San Miguel, whose
broad leagues represented a princely
share of Sonora's vast area.
But the rural chief had only laughed at
the maiden's fears, for young Sanchez
Â¦was known throughout the length and
breadth of more than one State in the
Mexican republic as a character whom,
despite his wealth, lew fathers would
Trfsh to own as a son-in-law. Therefore.
Velasco bad imprinted a lover^s kiss on
the eenorita's hand and galloped away
through the moonlight to his camp among
the hills, feeling that having won her
favor was more than half the conquest.
Thus It wfti with a heart all aglow
with hope for thÂ» future that he had
mounted his horse on the following day
and rode down from the hills to seek an
Interview with the patron of Del Mar.
He had found Don Felipe seated alone on
the broad veranda of his abode, and with
the straightforwardness of a soldier, had
laid his cause before him. The old don
had listened In silence as the captain pro
ceeded, but 'at the close of his appeal had
arisen haughtily to his feet.
"Senor Velasco," he had replied, "for
two years past the doors of this, my
hoOse, have been open to you and you
have come and gone at your pleasure,
and, I thought, as my guest. Your rank
as a military officer inspired myself and
my household with confidence in you; and
now you dare to come and tell me that you
have violated that confidence by stealing
away the affection of one of my daugh
tersâone whose hand I have already !
pledged to another. And even were this
not 60, what right have you to seek her !
for a wifeâ where is the home to which <
you would take her? Would you that she :
tbould follow you to your rural camp la'.
the hills? Senor Velasco, you are mis- <
taken in presuming that my daughter I
cares for youâ I promise that 'ere a fort- i
night shall have passed you will be en- 1
lirely out of her mind. And now that I
I have epoken, It will perhaps be super- 1
fluous for me to add that I forbid further
visits from you to my house."
Throughout the continuance of . this
acrimonious rebuke, Â¦Velasco could scarce
ly believe his hearing. At Its conclusion
he had half opened h!s mouth as if to
reply, but. recovering himself had choked
back the words. For a moment there
after he had stood, hat In hand, and
grazed unflinchingly into Don Felipe's
eyes; then, without a word, had turned
aside, and swinging Into the saddle, rode
slowly away from the rancho.
And now, as Â¦word after word, and sen
tence after sentence of thÂ£ old Don's
scathing and unwarranted denunciation
of himself, to say nothing of his haughty
rejection of his suit, recurred to Velasco's
mind, his bitter discouragement can scarce
be wondered at. To think that all his
fondest hopes and plans had been so cru
elly and completely shattered! What,
now, to him were the 3000 pesos he had
treasured up out of his salary for tlie
furnishing of a home for his future bride?
The one senorita who could ever gucc
that home had been denied himâ and when
her heart was already hla own.
In the midst of this depressing train of
thought he suddenly realised two things,
namely, that the desert wind, which had
blown hot against his fare an hour at'o,
was positively stifling now, and that his
pony" had left the plain of Del Mar and
was climbing the rocky trail into the hill
country beyond. The joint revelation
seemed to madden him. His brain ; was
being consumed, he told himself, because
of the increasing distance between the
rancho and himself. With a Quick move
ment he wheeled his horse on *he stvsn
hill slope and, striking his sombrero back
from his feverish brow, turned his eyes
in the direction of the now distant build
ings. As he did so the first ohject that
attracted, his notice was a solitary
horseman entering, at a gallop, the
same gateway through which' he hadÂ»re
cently emerged. Though the distance was
too great to distinguish the rider there
could be no mistaking his identity, for the
rural's trained eye recognized the coal-,
black charger invariably ridden tÂ«y Ricar
do Sanchez.
* At sieht of him Velasco recalled Don
Felipe's recent utterance regarding h<s
daughter. "Pledged to another." A bale
ful lights kindled in his dark eyes as he
muttered" the galling words and realized
how well grounded had been the fears
confided to him on the preceding evening
by Dona Inez. And, while his -spirit of
rebelliousness was at its fiercest stajce,
his attention was drawn to another cir
cumstance which had until then escaped
his notice. "The line of foothills which lay
beyond the broad, grass-grown- campo to
the eastward of Del Mar was enveloDf d
In vast, ominous-looking clouds of smoke,
and Velasco knew that in the midst of
those hills were situated the ranch houses
of the v Hacienda San Miguel.
Xow, there were three distinct compo
nents in the material construction of Ra
mon Velasco, and, as Is .frequently the
case with mortals, those elements were
apt, under certain circumstances, to in
spire him with very diverse Impulses. To
begin with, he was intensely human; he
waa also 'a Mexican; likewise a rural. Un
fortunately, one of the first tendencies of
a strictly human nature is a proneness to
rejoice at the misfortunes of an enemy
and, if possible, to reap a selflsh profit
therefrom. Wherefore Velasco promptly
announced himself that he cared not If
the whole Sanchez estate should be wiped
out of existence, andâ yes, he doggedly
included the Rancho del Mar in the pros
pective conflagration. For the latter ca
tastrophe might afford him a most ex
cellent opportunity of rescuing his lady
love, thereby winning the sanction of Don
Felipe to their union." Then the "Mexl-.
can" ingredient "asserted itself, and he
hated his weakness of a moment before,
telling himself that if he wanted the fair â¢
Inez above all else in the world the. proper
course to pursue was to ride back to the
rancho and j take her. regardless of Don
Felipe's objections. Just what the out-
come of this menial contention might
have proved had there been but. two ele
ments involved in the controversy is prob
lematical; but right here the third factor
in Velasco's triune constitution came to
the surface, and peremptorily commanded
him to put aslfie his affairs of the heart,
forthwith assemble his troop and ride to
the assistance of the stricken Hacienda
San Miguel. A second later he was spur
ring his eager pony up the trail toward
the 'headquarters of his command, at a
surprising: rate of speed considering the
ruggedness of the hillside. Metaphorically
he was neither "human" . nor "Mexican"
nowâ he -was wholly, dlstinctly-a "rural."
Upon arriving at the camp Velasco
found his troopers already iri the saddle
and impatiently awaiting his return. But
the explanation of their readiness for duty
was quite in the nature of a revelation
to him. Several hundred Yaquls had sud
denly descended from their stronghold in
the neighboring mountains on one of their
characteristic raids, the burning of the
"ranch buildings at San Miguel being th3
result of an attack, which even then was
supposed to be at its he'ght. *The news*
had been brought into camp but' a few
moments since by one of the rural "scouts,
which accounted for the readiness of tha
troop to move.
It .was five good leagues to the burning

could cove.r the distance there was a
strong probability th.it the foe would have
finished their fiendish work at. that point
and have departed for. newer scenes of
destruction. Therefore, by way of pre
caution, he first detached a Squad o'
twenty men from h's command and di
rected them to ride posthaste to Del Mar.

should prove the succeeding object of at

loss, he placed himself at the head of his
remaining TTJurscore horsemen, and, strik
ing his rowels, led them at full gallop
down from the hill3 and across the campo
in the direction of San' Miguel.
The afternoon was merging into dusk
when the cavalcade dashed through the
burning hay fields on the outskirts of the
hacienda. And' now it â¢ became evident'
that the direst destruction their worst
fears had predicted had been visited upon
the place; for' only the blackened walls'
remained of the o.icc substantial build

lay the charred bodies of the massacred
victims, while the inhuman perpetrators'
of the deed were nowhere to be seen.

around the piemlses In search of the hos>

vealcd two positive facts, namely, that
the trail was an hour old and that it led
to a line of foothiiia extending to Â».ho
south and west, in the shelter of whlcn
the marauders might travel unnoticed u>
to the very gates of the Rancho del Mar.
With a look of grim desperation in his .
bronzed features the rural swung himself
back into his saddle, and, signaling - hid
troop to follow, took up the pursuit."
Darkness had set in tefore half the length- ;
of the trail among the hills had been fol- :

sary to trace it fairther; for from the di
rection of Del Mar there emanated a pan- '
demonium of demoniac yells, interspersed ;
with rifle shots, that left no doubt in the
mind of the rurales as to the whereabouts
of the Yaqui' band. \ 1

5"I can't help it." gaeped Jackson. "I
am the heirâ but. you see, boys, there
ain't any property."
"What do you mean? Is all that a
sell?" demanded Rice.
"Look here; Jack! don't sit there cack
ling like a chuckle-headed magpieâ if you
are the heir."
But here Jackson Wells* youthful face
lost its perplexity, and hÂ« began to laugh
long and silently to himself. This was
protracted to tsuch an extent that Dexter
asserted himfcelf, as foreman and senior
partner.
"May we congratulate you, Mr. Wells,"
said Wyngate with affected politeness,
"or possibly your uncle may have been
English, and a title goes with the* 'prop,'
and you may be Lord Wells,' or Very
Wellsâ at least."
The three miners' faces lightened and
turned Joyously to Wells. But his face
looked puzzled.
Dexter Rice, the foreman, took the
proffered telegram from Wells' hand and
read as follows: "Your uncle, Quincy
Wells, died yesterday, leaving you sole
heir. Will attend you to-morrow for in
structions. Baker & Twiggs. attorneys,
Sacramento."
There was another pause, which seemed
to be Interminable to the waiting part
ners. Then the voice of Wells, in quite
natural tones, said: "By gum! That's
funny! Read that. Dexterâ read it out
loud."
There was a dead silence. Telegrams

pecially with the youthful bohemian
miners of the "Zip Coon" Ledge. They
were burning with curiosity, yet a sin
gular thing happened. Accustomed as
they had been to a life of brotherly fa
miliarity and unceremoniousness, this
portentous message from the outside
â¢world of civilization recalled their old for
mal politeness. They looked steadily
away from the receiver of the telegram,
and be, on his part, stammered an apolo
getic "Excuse me, boys," as he broke the
envelope.

He was shading his eyes with his hand
as he razed over the broad, sun-baked

entered the .wide straggling street of

filled with the radiance of ltB blossoms
and fragrant with their incense. His first

wicked maternal uncleâ the hated appro

and there's always one who rakes in the

that's why," continued Rice, abandoning
his slightly philosophical . attitude and
laying his hand tenderly and yet with a
singularly significant grip on Wells' arm.
"we say to him, 'Hang on to that will and
Uncle Quincy's. memory.' And we hev to
say It. For he's that tender-hearted and
keerless of moneyâ having his own share

The lawyer looked curiously at Rice and
his companions, and then turned to Wells.
"Nevertheless, I must look to you for in

_,,n-i Â»ad never taken any notice of him.
He answered, affirmatively.
"There may he some attempt to contest

and read as follows: "I exclude my

"I should not think that the house, the
claim and the land would bring more than
$1500," replied Twiggs submissively.
Indeed, this Jdea was carried out with
such elaboration the next day that Mr.
Twiggs, .the attorney, was considerably
impressed both by the conduct of his
guide who (although burning with curi
osity), expressed absolute Indifference re
garding Jackson Wells' inheritance, and
the calmness of Jackson himself, who had
to be ostentatiously called from his work
on the Ledge to meet him and who even
gave him an audience in the hearing of his
partners. Forced, into an apologetic at
titude, he expressed his regret at being
obliged to bother Mr. Wells with an affair
of such secondary importance, but he was
obliged to carry out the formalities of the
lav/.
"What do you suppose the estate is
worth?" asked Wells carelessly.
A cloud had settled on Zip Coon Ledge.
They knew of Buckeye Hollow and It was
evident that no pood had ever yet come
out of that Nazareth.
"There's no use of; talking now." said
Rico conclusively. "You'll draw it all from
that lawyer shark who's coming here to
morrow, and you can bet your life ho
wouldn't havft taken this trouble If there
wasn't suthin' In it. Anyhow, we'll knock
off" work now and call it half a dayâ in
honor of our distinguished voung friend's
accession to his baronial cstatea of Buck
eye Hollow. We'll Just toddle down to
Tomlinson's at the crossroads and have a
nip and a quiet game of old sledge at
Jacksy's expense. I reckon the estate
good for that," he added with severe
gravity. "And, speaking as a fair-minded
man and president of yer, company. If
Jackson would occasionally take out and
air that telegraphic dispatch of his while
we're at Tomlinson's, it might do some
thing for that company's creditâ with
Tomllnson! We're wantin' some new
blastln' plant bad!"
Oddly enough, the telegramâaccidental
ly shown at Tomlinson's produced a
gratifying effectâ and the Zip Coon Ledge
materially advanced in public estimation.
.With this possible Infusion of new capital
into its resources, the company was beset
by offers of machinery and gooda, and it
was deemed expedient by the sapient R!ce
that to prevent the dissemination of any
more accurate Information regarding
Jackson's property the next day, the law

to rub into him that we are In the habit

"That'B so," chimed in Pulaskl Briggs,
the fourth partner, "and I'll tell you what,
Jacksy. we'll come over with you the day
you take possession and Just 'prospect'
the whole blamed shanty, pig styes and

For a moment Jackson's face had really
brightened under the Infection of enthusi
asm, but it presently settled Into per
plexity again.
"No! You be.t the boys around Buckeye

that long ago."
"Buckeye Hollow!" repeated Rice and
his partners.
"Yes, Buckeye Hollow; that's the place;
not twenty miles from hereâ and a god

Wyngate with optimistic decision. "That's

girlâand an equally .unpleasant memory
of this other uncle,. who was purse-proud

"Not on your sideâ not on your side,"

Wells was for a moment silent. But Dex
ter Rice was equal to the emergency and
turned to the astonished lawyer with se
vere dignity. '-You'll excuse me for inter
ferin', but as the senior partner -of this
yer Ledge, and Jackson Wells yer, bein'
a most important member, what j affects
his usefulness on this claim affects us.
And we propose to carry out this yer will,
with all its dips and spurs and angles!"
As the surprised . Twiggs turned from
one to the other Rice continued: "Ez far

down to a square meal or ever rose from
a square game but what he allus said:- 'If
old Uncle Quince was only here now,
boys, I'd die happy. 1 .1 leave it to you,
gentlemen, if that wasn't Jackson Wells'
gait all the time?" There was a prolonged
murmur of assent and an , affecting cor
roboration from Ned, Wyngate of "That

adopted daughter of the . said Morley
Brown, with the privilege of assuming the

he continued, "as the young lady's pres
ent position is a better one than it would
be if she were in her father's house, and
was evidently a compromise, the senti
mental consideration of her being left
homeless and penniless, falls, to the
ground. However, as the inheritance is
small, and might be of little account to
you, if you choose to waive it I daresay
we maymake some arrangement."
Nevertheless it was with some misgiv
ings that Wells consented that his three
partners should actually accompany him
and see, him put In peaceable posÂ«ssion,

that there wou.a be no contest, of the
will, and still less any opposition on the
part of the objectionable relative,' Brown.
When the wagon which contained his per
sonal'effects and the few articles of fur
niture necessary for his occupancy of
the" cabin arrived the exaggerated swag
ger which his Companions had put on in
their passage through the settlement gave
way to a pastoral Indolence equally half
real, half-affected. Lying on their backs
under a buckeye they permitted Rice to
voice the general sentiment: "There's a
suthin' soothin' and dreamy in this kind
o* life. Jacksy, and we'll make a point of
corain* here . for. a couple i of- days every
two weeks to lend you a hand; It will be
a mighty good change from our nigger
work on the claim." In spite of this as
surance and the fact that they had volun
tarily come. to help him put the place In
order they, did very .little beyond lending:
a cheering expression of unqualified praise
and' unstinted advice. At the end of four
He put all this diffidently before his
partners on his return, and was a little
startled at their adopting it with sanguine
ferocity. They hoped that he would put
an end to his thoughts of backing out of
it. Such a course now would be dishonor
able, to his uncle's memory. It was clearly
his duty to resist these blasted satraps
of capitalists; he was providentially se
lected for the purposeâ & village Hamp
den to withstand .the tyrant. "And I
reckon that shark of a lawyer knew all
about It when he was gettln* off that
'purp . stuff' about people's sympathies
with the girl," said Rice belligerently.
"Contest the will, would he? Why, if
we caught that Brown with a finger in
the pie we'd just whip up the boys on
this ledge and lynch him. You hang onto
that three acres and the garden patch of
your forefathers, sonny, and we'll see you
through!" â¢ * ;<Â¦Â¦.'- ;
signs to get this three acres with thÂ«
other lands? If so, his long-suffering un
cle was only just In his revenge.
Eut'by this, time, Jackson Wellsâal
though really dubious about supplanting
the orphanâ had gathered the sense of his
partners and said, with a frank show of
decision, "I think I must stand by the
will."'
"Then I'll have it proved," said Twiggs,
arising. "In the meantime if there is any
talk of contestingâ"
"If there is, you might say," suggested
Wyngate, who felt" he had not had a fair
show in the little comedy, "ye might say
to that old skeesicks of a wife's brother,
if he wants to nipple in, that there are
four men on the Ledgeâ and four revol

ful men, but when an old, man's heart is
broken and his 'gray hairs brought, down
in sorrow to the grave, so to speak, we're
bcund to attend the funeral. Sabe?"
When Mr. Twiggs had departed again,
accompanied by a partner to guide him
past the dangerous shoals of Tomlinson's
grocery, Rice clapped his hand on Wells'
Rhculder. "If it'- hadn't been for me, son-"
ny, that shark would have landed you
into some compromise with that-'red
haired gal! I saw you weakenin', Â¦ and
then I. chipped in. I may have piled up
the 'agony: a little on your love for old
Quince, but if you aren't an ungrateful
cub, that's how you ought to hev. been

partner's loyalty : and convmceu oi nJufj
own disinterestedness, felt a painful sense
of lest chivalrous opportunity. Â¦ Â¦Â¦';' Â¦',Â¦'.'Â¦Â¦:
On mature consideration it was finally
3ettled that Jackson - Wells should ,'make
his preliminary, examination of his inheri
tance alone, as it might seem inconsist

of his partners if they ' accompanied * him.

to a sunny slope where the market garden
of three acres seemed to roll" like a river
of green rapids to a little "run", or brook,
which, even' in the dry season, showed a .
trickling rill. But here he was struck by
a singular circumstance. The garden rest
ed in a rich alluvial soil, and under the
"quickening Californian sky had developed
far beyond the ability of its late cultiva
tor to restrain or keep it in order. Every
thing had grown luxuriously and in mon
strous size and profusion. v *The garden
had even trespassed its bounds . and im
pinged upon the, open road, the deserted
claims and tho < ruins *of the past. Stimu
lated by 'the little 7 cultivation* Quincy

the hollow.. There were scarlet j runners

this obliteration of a previous tenancy;
there was the better chance for him to
originate something. He whistled hope
fully as he lounged with his hands in his
pockets toward the only fence and gate
that gave upon the " road- ( Something
stuck up on . the gatepost attracted his
attention. It was a sheet of paper bear
ing the inscription in a large hand: ."No-,

faded black letters on the gate which
had borne the legend; "Qulney Wells, .
dealer in Fruit and Vegetables," had been
rudely altered in chalk to read "Jackson
Wells, Double Dealer in Wills and Codi
cils," and the Intimation "Bouquets sold
here" had . been changed ,Â¦ to. "Bequests
Etole here." For an instant the simple
minded Jackson failed to discover any sig
nificance, of this outrage â which seemed
to him to be merely the wanton mischief
of a schoolboy. But a sudden recollection
of the lawyer's caution sent the. blood to
his cheeks and kindled his indignation. -
He tore, down the paper and rubbed out
the chalk interpolationâ and then laughed
at his own anger. Nevertheless he would
not have liked his belligerent partners to

A little curious to know the extent' of
this feeling, he entered one of the shops
and by one or two questions, which ju
diciously betrayed his ownership of the
property, he elicited only a. tradesman's
interest in a possible future customer and
the ordinary curiosity in a stranger. The
barkeeper of the hotel was civil, but brief
and gloomy. He had heard the property

family quarrel which "warn't none of

They walked leisurely but silently to
the gate. It is probable that none of
them believed in a serious collision, but
now the prospect had enough possibility
in it to quicken their pulses. They reach
ed the gate. But It was still closed; the
road. beyond it empty.
"Mebbe they've sneaked round to the
cabin," said Briggs, "an* are holdin' 'it

that direction, when Wyngate said:
"Hush! Some one's there in the brush

was a faint rustling in the shadows.
"Come out o' that, Brownâ into the
open. Don't be shy," called out Rice in
cheerful irony. "We're waitin' for ye.'.'
But Briggs, who was nearest the wood
here suddenly uttered an exclamation,*
"B'gosh!" and fell back, open mouthed,
upon his companions. They, too, in anoth
er moment, broke into a feeble laugh, and
lapsed against each other in sheepish si
lence. For a very pretty girl, handsomely
dressed, swept out of the wood and ad
vanced toward them.
Even at any time she would have been
an enchanting vision to these men, but in
the glow of exercise and sparkle of anger
she was bewildering. Â¦ Her wonderful hair,
the color of freshly hewn redwood, had
escaped from her . hat in her passage
through the underbrush, and even as she
swept down upon them in her majesty
she was Jabbing a hairpin into it with
a dexterous feminine hand.
The three partners turned quite the
color of her hair â Jackson Wells alone re-,
mained white and rigid. She came on;

white teeth with her panting breath/ '
Rloo was first to speak. "I begâ your

But she only turned a blighting brown
eye on the culprit, curled â¢ her snort . lip
till it almost vanished in her scornful
nostrils, drew her skirt aside with a Jerk,
and continued her way straight to Jack
son Wells, where she halted., j â. .-â¢ ..
"We did- not, know you .. wereâ here

"Thought I was afraid to come alone %
didn't you? Well, you , see,- I'm not. f
There!" She. made another- dive at. her
hat and. hair and brought the hat down
wickedly over her straight eyebrows.
"Gimme my plants."' \
"Would you mind bringing them, as far,
as the buggy that's coming .â¢ down the
hill?'" she said, pointing to a buggy driven
by ft small boy, -which was slowly ap
proaching the gate. The men tenderly
lifted the uprooted plants, each carrying
one, and proceeded solemnly. Miss Wells

They passed out first. Miss Welte

Jackson . readily, still . under the malign

astonished Wells. ' ' Â¦ . ' .

Wells impatiently. ,. " \ , -..'>

Miss Wells' eyes glared at themâ
though her mouth still smiled ravishingly.
"I'm sure I'm troubling you." v
In a few moments the plants : were
dug up and carefully laid together: in
deed, the servile Briggs had added a
few that she had not Indicated. ;
"Everything that Cousin ' Josey : planted
with her own hands must be took up care
fully and sent backâ even though it's kln
ln' me to part with it," quoted Wyngate
unblushingly, as he slouched along on the
other side. : ... Â¦',:.?. :"Â¦"Â¦ â¢ ,Â¦ i .

hours' weeding and trimming the boun
daries of the garden, they unanimously
grave their opinion that It would be more
systematic for him to employ Chinese la
bor at once. "You 6ee," said Ned Wyn
gate, "the Chinese naturally take to this
kind o f business. Why, you can't take
up a china plate or saucer but you see 'em
pictured there working at Jobs like this,
and then they kin live on green things
and rice that cost nothin'. and chickensâ
you'll keep chickens, of course?"
Jackson thought that his hands would
be full enough with the jrarden, but he
meekly assented. "I'll get a pairâ you
only want two to begin with," continued
Wyngate cheerfully, "and In a month or
two you've got all you want and eggs
enough for market. On second thoughts
I don't know whether you hadn't better
begin with eggs first. That is, you bor
row some eggs from one man and a hen

when the chickens are hatched out you
Just return the hen to the second man,
and the eggs, when your chickens begin

your chickens for nothingâ and there you
are."
This ingenious proposition, .which iras
delivered on the last slope of the domain
where the partners were lying exhausted
from their work, was broken in upon by
the appearance of a email boy barefooted,'
sunburnt and tow-beaded, who, after a
moment's hurried scrutiny of the group,
threw a letter with unerring precision
Into the lap of Jackson Wells and then
fled precipitately. Jackson Instinctively
suspected he was connected with the out
rage on his fence and gatepost, but as he
had avoided telling his partners of the
Incident, fearing: to increase their bellig
erent attitude, he felt now an awkward

Wells signed reluctantly, and Wyngate
offered to find a Chinaman in the gulch

"But this will look as if we were angry
and wanted to keep the plants," protested
Wells.
"Sirâ In reply to the hogwash you have
kindly exuded in your letter of to-day, I
have to Inform you that you can have

"Now sign it," continued Bice, handing
him the pencil. Â¦ â¢ ' Â¦
Here Ned " Wyngate was heard to mur
mur and Jackson was one of those men
who would lie down and let coyotes crawl
over him if they first presented a girl's
visiting card, but he was stopped by Rice
demanding paper and pencil. The for
mer being torn from a memorandum
book and a stub of the latter produced
from another pocket, he wrote as follows:
"And" what then?" persisted Jackson,
with a certain show of j independence.
"If the stuff belongs to the girl, I'm not
certain I shan't'' give them up without
any fuss. Lord! I want nothing but
what the old man left meâ and , certainly
nothing- of hers."
It is to be feared that Jackson would
have suppressed this also, but the keen
eyes of his partners, excited by the
abruptness of the messenger, were upon
him. He smiled feebly, and laid the let
ter before them. But he waa unprepared
for. their exaggerated indignation, and
with difficulty restrained them from dash-
Ing off in the direction of the vanished
herald. "And what could you do?" he
said, "the boy's only a messenger."
"I'll get at that skunk. Brown, who's
back of him," said Dexter Rice.
"Wellâ don't!" she burst out abruptly.
He stared at her.
"Oh. I'm not trying to keep you here."
she went on, flashing back into her old
temper, "so you needn't stare like that.
I say 'don't' because it ain't rightâ it ain't
fair."
"Whyâ he's left mÂ» no alternative." ha
said.
"That's Just Itâ that's why It's mean
and low. I don't care if he la our uncle."
Jackson was bewildered and shocked.
"I know It's horrid to say It," she said,
with a white face, "but It's horrldsr to
keep It in! Oh Jack! when we were little*
â arid used to fight and auarrelâ I never
was mean â was I? I never was under
handedâwas I? I never lied â did I? And
I can't He now, Jack," she looked hurried
ly around her, "he wants to get hold of
the landâ he thinks there's gold in tha
slope and bank by the stream. He says
Dad was a fool to have located bis claim
so high up. Jack, did you ever prospect
the bank?"
A dawning of intelligence came upon
Jackson. "No," he said, "but." he added,
bitterly. **what"s the use? He owns the
water nowâ I couldn't work it."
"But. Jackâ if you found the color, this
would be a mining claim! You could claim
the water right â and as it's your land
your claim would be first!"
Jackson was startled. "Yes, If I found
the color."
"You would find it." \
"Would?"
"Yes! I did. On the sly! Yesterday
morning on your slope by the stream
when no one waa up! I washed a pan
ful and got thatâ." She took a piece of
tissue paner from her pocket, opened it
and shook into her little palm three tiny
pin points of gold.
"And that was your own idea, Jossv?"
"Yes." , Â¦ - â â J
"Your very own?"
"Honest Ingin!"
"Wish you may die?"
"True, O King!"
He opened his arms and they mutually
embraced. Then they separated, taking
hold of each other's hands solemnly and
falling back until they were at arm's
length. Then they slowly extended their
arms sideways at full length until this ac
tion naturally brought their faces and lips
together. They did this with the utmost
gravity three times, and then embraced
again, rocking on pivoted feet like a met
ronome.. Alas! It was no momentary in
spiration. The moat casual indifferent ob
server could see that it was the result of
long previous practice and shameless ex
perience. And as such â it was a revela
tion and an explanation.
"I always suspected that Jackson was
playln' us about that red haired cousin,"
said Rice two weeks later, "but I . can't
swallow that purp stuff about her puttin*
him up to that dodge about a new gold
discovery on a fresh claim Just to knock
out Brown. No. sir. He found that gold
in ODenln' these irrigatin" trenches â the
usual nigger luckâ flndin* what you're not
lookin' arter."
"Well, we can't complain, for he's of
fered to work It on shares with us." said
Briefs.
"Yesâ until he's ready to take in an
other partner."
It was his cousin standing a few yard*
from him In evident hesitation. She waa
quite pale, and for a moment he thought
she was still suffering from her fall, until
he saw in her nervous half-embarrassed
manner that It had no physical cause.
Her old audacity and anger seemed gone,
yet there waa a cueer determination in
her pretty brows.
"Good evening." he said.
She did not return his greeting, but
pulling uneasily at her gloves said hesi
tatingly, "Uncle has asked you to sell
him this land?"
He had little heart in his labors that
day and dismissed the Chinaman early.
He again examined his uncle's old min
ing claim on the top of the slope, but was)
satisfied that It had been a hopeless en
terprise and wisely abandoned. It waa
sunset when he stood under the buckeyes,
gloomy looking at the glow fade out or
the west as it had out of his boyish hopes.
He had grown to like the place. It was
the hour. too. -when the few flowers ha
had cultivated gave back their pleasant
odors as if grateful for his care. And
then be beard his name called.
sterile. Jackson suaaenry recalled the
prophecy of the gloomy barkeeper. The
end had come! But what ' could th*
scheming capitalist want with the land
equally useless, as bis uncle had proved,
for mining purposes? Could it be sheer
malignity, Incited by his vengeful cousin?
But here he paused, rejecting the Idea as
quickly as It came. No, bis partners
were right He was a trespasser on his
cousin's heritageâ there was no lack In It
he was wrong, and this was his punish
ment! Instead of yielding gracefully as
he might, he must back down now, and,
she would never know hla first real feel-
Ings. Even now he would make over tha
property to her as a free gift, but biÂ»
partners bad advanced him money from
their scanty means to plant and work it.
He believed that an appeal to their feel-
Ings would persuade them to forego even
that; but he shrank even more from con
fessing his defeat to them than to her.

The afternoon wore on; the tall Doug
las'pines near the water pools wheeled
their long shadows round and half way
up the. slope, and the sun began to peer
into the faces of the reclining men. Sub
tle odors of mint and southernwood,
stragglers from the garden,. bruised by
their limbs, replaced the fumes of their
smoked-out pipes, and the hammers of
the woodpeckers were busy in the' grove
as they lay lazily nibbling the fragrant
leaves like peaceful ruminants. Then
came, the sound of approaching wheels
along the invisible highway beyond the
buckeyes, and then a halt and silence.
Rice rose slowly; bright pin points in the
pupils of his gray, eyes.
"BrJngin' a wagon with him to tote the
hull shanty away," said Wyngate.
"Or fetched his own ambulance," said
Brisgs. Nevertheless after a pause the
wheels presently rolled away again
"We'd better go and meet him at the
gate." said Rice, hitching his revolver
holster nearer his hip. "That wagon
stopped long enough to put down three

He could see j that she had been petted
' and spoiled by her new guardian and his
friends far beyond his conception. But
j why she should grudge htm the little gar
den . and the pastoral life for which she
'was so unsulted puzzled him greatly.
. One afternoon he was working near the
road, when he was startled by an outcry
from hla Chinese laborers, their rapid dis
persal from the strawberry beds whera
.they were working, the splintering crash
of his fence rails and a commotion among
the buckeyes. Furious at. what seemed
to | him one of the usual wanton attacks
upon coolie labor, he seized his pick and
ran to their assistance. But he was sur
prised to find Jocelinda's mustang caught
by the saddle and struggling between two
trees, and Its unfortunate mistress lying
upon the strawberry bed. â¢
; Shocked but cool headed. Jackson re
leased the horse first, which was lashing
about and destroying everything within
' his reach, and then turned to his cousin.
; But she had already lifted herself to her
elbow, and with a trickle of blood and
mud on one fair cheek was surveying him
scornfully under her tumbled hair and
hanging hat. â¢â¢ . " ' ; .
"You don't suppose I was trespassing
on your wretched patch again, do you?'
she said in a voice she was trying to
keep from breaking. "It was that brute
âwho bolted." ." f
. "I don't suppose you were bullying me
this time." he said, "but you were your
horseâ or It wouldn't have happened. Are
you hurt?" ,
She' tried to move: he offered her his
hand, but she shied from It, and strug
gled to her feet. She took a step for
wardâbut limped. .
"If you don't want my arm, let me call
a Chinaman," he suggested. .
She glared at him. "If you do 1 11
scream!" she said in a. low voice, and he
knew she would. But at the same mo
ment her face whitened, at which he slip
ped his arm under hers in a dexterous,
businesslike way, so as to support her
weight. Then her hat got askew and
down cam* a long braid over his shoul
der; he remembered it of oldâ only it was
- two or three feet longer and darker than
then. "It you could manage to limp as
far as the gate and sit down on the bank,
I'd get your horse for you," he said. I
hitched it to a sapling." â¢ .
"I saw you didâ before you even offered
to help me." she said scornfully.
"The horse would have got awayâ you
couldn't." . â
"If you only knew now I hated you,
ehe said with a white faceâ but a tremb
ling lip.
"I don't see how ' that would make
things any better," he said. "Better wipe
your face: it's scratched and muddy, and
you've been rubbing your nose In my
.strawberry bed." â¢ - _ '
Bhe snatched his proffered handkerchief
suddenly, applied it to her face and said,
"I suppose it looks dreadful."
"Like a pig's," he returned cheerfully.
She -walked a little more firmly after
this until they reached the gate. He
seated her on the bank and went back
for the mustang. That beautiful brute,
astounded and sore from its contact
with the top rail and brambles, was
cowed and subdued as he led it back.
She had finished wiping her face and
was hurriedly disentangling two stinging
tears from, her long lashes before she
threw back his handkerchief. Her
sprained ankle obliged him to lift her
Into the saddle and adjust her little shoa
in the stirrup. *He remembered when It
was still smaller. . "You used to ride
astride," he said, a flood of recollection
coming over him, "and it's much . safer
with your temper and that brute."
"And you," she said in a lower voice,
"used to be " But the rest of her sen
tence-was lost In the switch of the whip,
and the jump of her horse, but he thought
the word was "kinder."
Perhaps this was why, after he watched
her canter away, he went back to the gar
den, and from the bruised and trampled
strawberry bed gathered a small basket
of the finest fruit, covered them with
leaves, added a paper with the highly in
genious witticism, "Picked up with you,"
and sent them to her by one of the China
men. Her forcible entry moved Li Sing,
his foreman, also chief laundryman to. the
settlement, to reminiscences:
"Me heap knew Missy Wells *pnd ole
man who go dead. Ole man allee time

jaw, jawâ allee time make lowsâ allee time

now. Plenty fun. Plenty stay, in Blown's
big house, top side hill: Blown first chop
man." â¢ Had he inauired .he might have
found this pagran testimony for once cor
roborated by the Christian neighbors.
But another incident, drove all this,
from his mind. The little . stream â the
llfeblood of his gardenâ ran dry. Inquiry
showed that it ha* been' diverted two
miles away Into Brown's ditch. Wells'
Indignant protest elicited a formal reply
from Brown, stating: that he owned the
adjacent mining claims, and reminding
jacKson had beeni astonished. He
would have scarcely recognl2ed In this
willful beauty the red-haired girl whom
he had boyishly hated and with whom
he had often quarreled. But there was
a recollectionâ and with that' recollection
came an instinct of habit. , He looked her
squarely in the face and to the horror of
his partners said: "Say please!"
They had expected to see' him fallâsmit
ten with the hairpin! But she only
stopped and then in bitter irony said'
"Please; Mr. Jackson Wells." ,
"I haven't dug them up yetâ and it
would serve you just right if I made
you get it for yourself. But perhaps my
friends here might heli> youâ if you were
civil." The three partners seized spades
and hoes and rushed forward 1 eagerly
"Only show us what you want," they said
in one voice. The young girl stared at
them and at Jackson. Then with a swift
determination, she turned her back scorn
fully upon .him and with a dazzling smile
which reduced the three men to absolute
idiocy said to the others, "I'll show you "
and marched away to the cabin. '
"Ye mustn't mind. Jacksy," said Rice
sycophantically edging to her side, "he's
so cj'-t up with losin' your father, that
he loved like a son," he isn't himself, and

They were quite firm . in this decision-,
however 'absurd or obscure' their conclu
sionsâand Jackson,' after his first flash
of Indignation, felt a certain relief: In
their departure. But strangely enough
while he had hesitated about keeping the
property: when they were j violently In
favor of it, he. now. felt- he was right in
retaining it against theiradvice to com
promise. . The sentimental idea had van
ished with . his recognition of his hateful
cousin in the role of the Injured orphan.
And for the same odd reason her. pretti-.
ness only; increased his resentment. He
was not deceivedâ It was the same capri
cious, willful red-haired girl. :..:,
The next â¢ day â¢ he set himself to work
with that dogged steadiness that belonged
to his simple nature and which had en
deared .him to his partners. He set half
a dozen Chinamen \ to work â and followed
âalthough apparently" directing Â¦.â¢â¢ their

WHEN THE DEAD SEEM T O AWAKEN
LIVE persons have feigned deach
with marvelous, exactness. but
'when the dead feign life, or seem
to feign life', the spectacle. ls< as
grewsome as can well be Imazined.
Not long ago a Russian cemetery was
the scene of as weird a weddlns a3 ever
has been witnessed. A young girl who had
been betrothed died on the'eve of her mar
riage, and her friends decided that in
spite of the intervening hand of death the
marriage should be carried on, and the
ceremony Â«vas performed at the side of
the grave, and after the >marriase the
body was returned to the coffln and low
ered to Its long resting place. " j
It is less than a year ago that a valu
able cup was won in a bicycle race in
Australia by. a man who was -lead when
he passed the winning post. The' race took
place at an "electric light carnival," so
called, in the presence of 10,000 spectators.
In the last lap James Somerville. a rider,
forged to the front and secured suc!i a
lead that his victory was assured. .When
within twenty-five yards of the finish he
was seen to relax his hold on the handle
bar and to relax his hold on the pedals.
He did r.ot fall from the machine, -owever,
and amid frantic cheers dashed by the
goal, winning the race by half a wheel. As
he passed the finishing post he nitched for
ward and fell to> the ground. When he
was nicked. up he-was found to be dead,
and what was more, the doctors declared
that death had come to him- when he was
seen to lose his hold of the handle bars.
It was a dead body that had ridden the
last twenty-five yards, of the race.
On a recent voyage the sealing schooner
Arietis was cruising about 200 miles oft
the coast of British Columbia when s!ie
sighted a dismasted ship. The Arietis bore
down upon the derelict, and as she got
near enough a man was seen on board
grasping the wheel and apparently steer
ing the craft. No other stans of man was
seen on the ship. The man at the wheel
was hailed but returned no answerâ just
stood there grasping the spokes of the
wheel and lookins straight ahead. A boat
was lowered and the mysterous ship
boarded. When they came close to the
man at the wheel. they saw with horror
that he was dead and had- evidently, been
dead for many days. The ship, which
was named the General Siglin, had sailed
from San Francisco for Alaska. She had
clearly been dismantled in a gale and then
abandoned by. her crew., The captain-had
refused- to leave the ship, and finding his
strength .failing â¢ he had lashed himself
to the wheel, and literally died at his post,
steering" the craft >t or hundreds'of miles
with hands that held the wheel in as firm
a grip as when alive. ./
FEATS OF MALAY GYMNASTS
STOUNDING gymnastic feats, evi
//\ dencing remarkable physical endur
n w E.nce, are being performed just now
in the large cities of the European
continent by a troupe of Malays.
The troupe of performers comprises two
men and three women. The chief's name
is Deavida. His star feat has thrilled im
mense audiences. Deavida places a long
bamboo stick, which is adjusted in a mov
able pivot, against his abdomen, and then
balances himself in a semi-vertical pbsi
tiou on. its extreme point In midair. An
attendant then throws a number of
earthen vessels to him, which he catches
and balances on his head. He is able to
ir.a!i:tain his ecuilibrium on the bamboo
sticks, performing all sorts of Jugglery,
for nearly fifteen minutes.
The women of his troupe are young and
remarkably pretty, hailing from the
southwest coast of India. At home these
girls serve as bajaderes or dancers in the
temples. They are agile and efficient in
their art. German papers describe their
fire and evil dances as "hair -raising" in
their effort on the spectators.
Malabar, the second man of the com
pany, excels his companion In feats of
strength and in the faker's art. It is
claimed for him that his ancestors for
numerous generations past are recorded
Â¦ in India's history as the chiefs of necro
mancers and jugglers. The crowning lea
ture of his performance "consists in van
ishing from view on the stage while speak
ing and uttering weird incantations before
his audience. That it is all an optical il
lusion is obvious, but how it is done is dif
ficult to understand, as no second person
is Dresent, and no cloth or article of any
kind Is seen in the hands of Malabar. Ho
calls attention to his empty hands, walks
forward and backward before the foot
lights, then, without a word of warning,
he is gone. His reappearance is as sud
den and inexplicable as his disappearance,
the audience r.ot being able to observe a
single motion during the vanishing or re
appearing acts. Â»
These people. have never performed out
side of their own land. American showmen
have made them flattering oflers for tours
ofvthe United States, but all have been
decHned. The fact is they are homesick,
especially the women, who are unable to
undure the rigorous climate of Northern
Europe, and they are in deadly fear of
crossing the ocean.
TO PARE ELEPHANT'S CORNS
WILLIAM SNYDER, elephant
keeper and chiropodist," is the
way his cards should read, but
Snyder is not proud of his work
in removing corns and clipping toenails
from the feet of his iiuge charges in the
Central Park Zoo, so he is content to be
known merely as "the elephant man."
Julie and Tom, the huge beasts that eat
all the peanuts that visitors will give
them, are anxious to be given the free
dom of their back yards. They , feel the
spring warmth and they want to be out
of doors. But during the winter the five
toenails on each of the ponderous | feet
have grown several inches and must be
trimmed, and corns weighing perhaps ten
pounds each have been formed on. the
soles, of the feet. These toenails and
corns must be Temoved, and Keeper Sny
der "is the man who musfdo'it.
Snyder, explains that Â»wlld elephants
keep their toenails worn short and the
soles of their feet thin by exercise. While
in captivity, lack of. exercise causes corns
and bunions to form and the toenails be
come'too long and are frequently "in
growing." Tom has been manicured be
fore, and Snyder expects little trouble
with him, a3 he knows that the usÂ© of
rasp, jack plane, drawing knife and prun
ing shears is a necessary part of his
spring toilet.
"Julie is a worse proposition," says
Snyder. "She knows nothing about the
fine points of pedicure, and she Is ner-Â»
vcus, like most women. She will try to
kill me, sure.
"She won't lie down when I tell her,
and she , won't stay down when she's
there. She utterly refuses to put her foot
on the block, and she gets frightened to
death when we try to tie her. You might
Just as well try to tie down a locomotive
when she gets frightened.
"I'll take her in the morning, when we
can lock all the doors and there won't bÂ»
any spectators around to get killed. We'll
get tall the helpers to manage her and
ues all the rope in the park if necessary.
"People will hear her down at the. Bat
tery, but her corns" have got to be cut if
we have to call out the militia. When
the elephants get mad that way they
stir up all the other animals, and there*
will be a chorus singing that -will maka

Africa mixed with the prairies of tha
frontier."

I don't generally swell up about my ap
pearance, but I was O. ,-K. We looked
around over the clubhouse and 1 got along
up in G ; with the sister. â¢ Then .we
were rowed out. to Joe's boat where she
was staked, about a" hundred yards from
chore.
Ever see Joe's wife's sister? Say, she's
a winner, all rights Beautiful blonde
hair all good, too, I think, as well as I
could set- with my glasses. Great, .big
girl. I was glad I had bought some of the
right things in yachting duds; nice white
ducks and a blue cap with gold braid.
Now, I wasn't stuck on that a little bit.
I'm net partial to these nice little family
parties. But, you see, '1 had come in,
so 1 thought I might as well stay with
the game and later on drift in to some of
Joe's swell times.
"All right," said he. "We'll make it a
nice iittle home party for your maiden
run. I've got to square myself with my
wife this week, so you and I will take her
and her sister out."
"Come along next Sunday, then," said
Joe. And I said: "I'm your man; count
on me."
"Jack, do you know anything about
Bailing?" said he. "Oh, a few," said I
carelessly.
The idea of that select afternoon with
congenial spirits kind of took my fancy,
so I said if he would give me another
throw I would be with him on the' square.
Well, you know, I am not such a pile
on matters connected with the sea, but I
do know a few apt terms. I got them
down pat from running a half-column a
week of sailing news when I worked on
a paper in Nevada. .
He said: "Why, Jollop, I've tried time
and again to get you on the water, but
you didn't seem to be much on aquatics."

right. I asked him why he didn't let me
take a chance when there was something
doing like that.
He talked of a nice little feed on board
and lots of singing and Just enough wind

I thought I would do a yachting stunt.
I feel a little better now that the sun

a comDlexion like a new-born babe, but
my glasses hurt my nose so I can't read.
I had such a nice note from sister. Say,
that, girl's all right. She tells . me that
Joe has just bought his wife a sealskin.
I had to wear a sixteen collar and a fat
man's trousers home. The Â» doctor has
been coming every day since and I hope
he gets his money some time.
They finally got some hard wad down
me and I got up and took notice. I looked
like just about 5 cents' worth of skimmed
milk. You see â now this is on the quiet â
I had bought some navy blue underwear
to go with the ducks and I hadn't thought
it worth while to spend JS per for fast
colors. Well, the darned things turned
me into a blue-streaked Hyena and every
body laughed. Â¦ I would have licked the

filled my lungs up with so much bad liquid
corning up again that I felt like a blow

>^Then it was that those geezers came to
the conclusion it was time to take a hand,
and somebody grabbed me with a boat
hook. It la strange how foolish people
can be about handling sharp tools. He not
only ripped a gash In my shoulder, but
busted the back out of my new coat.

all right, all right. I might have been It
even then, but when I came up I had lost

feel so bad was' that I heard that big
duffer's sister say, "Oh, hej^s not hurt: he
only fell in the water," and then added,
something about too much liquor. The
last I couldn't catch very well, because I
was busy doing the three times up and
a morgue slab act. I knew I was off as a
hero In the eyes of sister, but still I hated
to yell. It was evident those - mariners

would have made good if it hadn't been
for the sea- roll in my legs and the spray

little too far.
could see that It was winners hands
down for Joe without me. But tho big
brother thought there out to be some
thing doing all along the line. He started
for me.
I tried to do the interested bystander
gag just off hand . for a minute, - for I
I will say it for the other fellow that
he was dead game, -for he wasn't as uig
as Joe, but he cut In' with: '.'I don't give
a damn who they are.." Then they com
menced passing them out pretty lively.
Joe had; the long end of the stick right
from the start and did splendid work.
When we rowed over in the amnll boat
and finally landed on the float I felt so
happy Mint I (nutated upon passing around

A guy who had just Joined the rlub
and had taken his wife and brother and
sister out for a sail landed his party
Just then on the float. It seems' he was
a little', sore on some remarks Joe's the
ntrical friends had passed before his
wife's crowd a Â¦ week ago. He had been
kicking about members bringing gay
birds around to the club where they
were apt to be bumped up against other
fellows' wives. I didn't know that. I
thought these people were a lot, of jolly
fellows like us. I offered the main stem
ray flask. He turned to his friend and
remarked in a free-for-all s4age whisper:
"This Is as bad as last week. This club
should take action to protect Its mem
bers from drunken roisterers and their
female friends." Pretty . good words,
those,, eh! "Female friends!". -Joe was
next to the Intimation and knew that
his wife would be asking questions about
that "bad last week." He got hot in the
collar and talked. back quick.
He said: "I understand that that re
mark is addressed against my party, and
you'll have-to apologize. This lady is
my wife and this is her sister." Joe al
ways Â¦:. had a very careless way about
stirring up, trouble.
You ought to have been around taking
polntÂ» ; to ace the way we "picked up our
moorings," uÂ» Joe Â«nyÂ», I did Â§ome great
work with the bonthook pinching the
hunch of chickens, nnd neurly went over
board. Hister said Itlwos n good ntunt on
my part, 'though, so i followed the, lead
and anked her to go driving with me in
the park if we ever rot on dry land. Say,
Â«ho'8 nil right! "The doc guys I won't be
out for a week yet,' but when 1 do I'll
make ft good.
â¢ I found that to keep a way from that
tired feeling In my stomach I had to hit
the hnrdwad outfit pretty rapid. Tint It
doesn't affect you much when you have
the fre*h jcnlt breezÂ« blowing In your face.
Those girJs wero all, right. They hit the
hard wad a bit- Just enough to be good
fellows, but not too much. And the way
they knew the names of the ropes and
what to do was a marvel. It was Just as
well, because I was a little on the, pork
as a sailor. J tTdn't put Joe on particu
larly, but I gucys he was wise. He was
good enough to say that the lick I got off
the island was enough to do anybody up,
and he would take me from the crew and
write m'4 down on the passenger list.
The only gladitidings I. had' from home
was the hard wad. Hard wad's what they
call the booze'in select yachting circles â
that Is, the 'skee; beer_ comes under the
head of soft. Joe said I'd better take
some hard wad, arid I did what was right
âyou know, thjt was a fearful crack I got
on the nook. Say, when you'drlnk out of
a demijohn you get more than you think
you do. '-'. '-Â¦-Â¦;
You know, you can't get seasick oh the
bayâ so Joe says. -But the general excite
ment had upset me a little. .
, It was so. rough we had. to hold on lo
something all the time to keep from fall
ing in. I would like .-to have held on to
the sisterâ my, but she is a. stunner!â
but' it was all 1 could do, to watch the
roll of the boat onny own account with
out doing missionary work. She grabbed
me once, and 1 guess suyed my life; I
was. not taking much notice at' the time.
Now, as a general rule I don't use pro
fanity before ladles, but I couldn't, help
throwing in that I didn't care a whoop in
hell if we missed' :he whole island. It
was all right though, because the girls
laughed, "so I didn't refer to the matter
again: ' â¢ -1v .,.'-Â¦ . ', " '
- I suppose I thought they were going to
fire a gun on. shore by way of salute as
we went by and I listened for the boom.
It's lucky my teeth'are not false. I lost
everything else that was movable and
came mighty near doing the sink or swim
act.
Joe swore and said we had missed our
stays.
Oft the Island Joe yelled "Come about: 1 '
and turned the wheel 'to baat the band.
I was standing up doing the polite to the
ladies. He sings out "Look out for the
Xoom."
First rattle out of the box the wind
won that J4 gold-braid hat of mine. No
use trying to look decent when you go
out with Joe. lie said It would do me
good -to 'get 'my face tanned. I got it.
That's the reason I'm wearing a cold
cream mask now.
Joe made me Â«et out In a small boat
with one of the nibs from the clubhouno
who carne to help and I nearly tore the
palms out of my hands before we got oft
the mud. Well, wh<*n .we got a clenn
BUirt we Just tore things up.
We nearly ran the clubhouse down be
cause Joe yelied -to me to "let ffo" the
'jib "and I untied the- first rope I pot my
har.d^ onâ y.ou know I am quick In an
emergencyâ and let down the center
hoard. To snvetho elubhomie we ripped
Jnto the mud and Joe patted the buck up
to, me, Bayln.T h* thought I knew a jib
shfet from a beer bnrrel. Well, you know
reading 1 ' how to do things I* all rJffhti but
I discovered 1 know aÂ»Â«much about run
ninj?.a boat nÂ» a cent piece does about

I ,You bet I don't want a yacht unless It
is a steam ferry with plenty of men to
work It. I nearly pulled a lung out haul
lry; up a 'bunch of blocks they call the
chickens and letting go the moorings.
Every # command on' shipboard I find is
"Let go." I suppose* some poor seasick
devil invented the term.
The' first thins he did was to make me
tal'c off my. hot shoes and put on a pair
of ' rubber-solfd canvas boys for fear 1
would scratch the blamed paint. Old wet
ones cut of'a dark corner of the cabin.

enough to be a man, anyway.
If you're a man you have to pay for frills
end furbelows that you never have the
privilege of wearing. If you're a man
you have to spend long, tiresome even-
Ings at the club just for policy, though
you're achin" to be at home. If you're a

FOUR TRAINS AT DIFFERENT
LEVELS IN VIEW AT ONE TIME
After a sleepiess night, filled with right-,
eous revenge, I resolved *to make Count
von Ponita eat his words if it took half a
lifetime, but J little expected that he
would follow the Indignity cast upon a
The officers were in the habit of fre
quenting a certain casino at Salzwedel
and exchanging pleasantries, garrison
chatter and theories about war, for which
we were ever eager. On one of these oc
casions. May 22, 1856, Major von Ponita,
evidently In -a spirit of pique to goad into
a quarrel his most promising rival; ut
tered a remark reflecting upon the fair
Countess â an observation Â¦ so brutal and
uncalled for thit my young blood warmed
to the boiling point. Although doubtless
I should have called the officer to account
then and there had not others of my fel
lows restrained me. Ignoring the uniform
of a superior in my sudden hatred for the
man who wore it, matters did not reach
a climax until the following day at drill.
After several years at both the universi
ties of Heidelberg and Bonn I became an
officer in one of the finest regiments of
the land, the Fourth Uhlans, .all the of
ficers of which were, like myself, noble
men. After a year's service . I was pro
moted to first lieutenant and stationed at
Balzwedel, in the province of Magdeburg.
The commander of the garrison was Ma
jor Count ' von Ponlta, a man of great
force of character, . but selfish, domineer
ing and headstrong. The major lived in
the neighborhood and his estates adjoined
these of the noble family of the Vonder
min-Boitzenburgs, with whose daughter
and heiressr-one of the most beautiful
women I ever 'beheldâ half the garrison
was in love, and none more, I dare say,
than the commander and myself.
"When I was a lad of 17 years my moth
er died, and from that time the direction
of my education devolved upon my moth
er's most Intimate friend, the Grand
Duchess Sophie of Weimar. It was under
her tutelage that I was permitted to en
joy more than glimpses of the gcand
world Into which my.', title exalted me,
and it was under hei^jenign roof that I
acquired the graces and chivalrous senti
ments which characterize the proud bear
ers of a feudal escutcheon â that chivalry
soon to be my ruin.
If the love of money is the root of all
evil, it is woman that Is at the bottom of
half the tragedy. I was 22 when the first
great episode of my life changed the
whole course of my destinyâ that age of
dangerous susceptibility which Byron
longed to perpetuate irtto eternity. Nobly
born in a country where the nobility were
fairly worshiped, impetuous, ambitious
and courting danger so long as it led to
glory, I was reared In Castle Dernbach,
In Thurlngia, destined to fulfill a high es

Charles von Larisch, my mother a famous
beauty of her time. Countess Antoinette

man who felt bound to preserve it from
such villainy at all hazard. The drill was
long and severe,' my commanding officer
constantly goading, reproving and harass
ing me to a point where human forbear
ance ceased to be a virtue. But when it
came to an actual blow with the flat of
his sword, rank was thrown aside and
facing each other only as man to man I
swept my glove across his face with . a
curse of challenge. *
A frightful yet triumphant sense -of
tragedy overcame me. Blood '~- spurted
from my mouth and blinded my left eye
from the wound at my temple, giving me
a sort of vertigo, so that I reeled in the
saddle and saw things in a hideous red
maze. Then a rallying came and there
shot into my heart a realization of my
deed and its direful consequences. In the
twinkling of an eye I saw Visions of
first terrific lunge was parried, although
the point of the sword struck me in the
left temple, all but gouging out my eye.
His second, aimed for the throat, struck

cutting away part of the lower jaw. "With
my adversary's bosom thus exposed, like
a flash of lightning I drove my sword

land of their birth and for reasons more
or less seriousâ whose real identities have
remained secrets from their dearest
friends and even their own families.
For forty-five years I have known what
Jt Is to be an expatriate â known what It is
to feel that there is one broad spot on the
globe where to set foot means imprison

How can one cook a breakfast in such
an affair? It's easy if you only know how.
"What can one cook? That's easy, too;
In fact, the easiest part of it all. But
variety is what all good housewives are
eternally and forever crying about. Here
are come mighty good ways to cook e fc r gs:
Some bright girl had 'a bright idea that
chocolate could be made quicker and bet
ter in the new plaything than in the much
abused 5 o'clock teapot,. so slowly bJt
surely, at any old time and any old place,
the toy fire came to be generally used.
THE chafing dish has passed . the
faddy stage and has become an ab
solute necessity. ,
-The fads are few and far be
tween that succeed in taking sujh
a hold on the fickle public, but when one
does everybody knows that there are .ill
kinds of merits backing it. The chaiing
dish, for instance, was first used for I'un.
The shiny dish made a pretty acquisition
to the table and it was awfully jolly to
show Tom, Dick and Harry that Moilie
could cook like a natural born chef.
There Is a long list of dishes that.'ar*
used with splendid effects: Bouillon cups
chop trays, well dish; cold meat dish,
casserole,, sandwich .tray, chocolate, tea
or coffee pot, plates, cups and .saucers,

- The table may or may not be elaborately
decorated. '. One â¢ of the simplest and yet
an' effective decoration Is of flowers and
greens. - Use some dainty center piece and
put a vase on a round mirror. ? Drop here
Then. â¢ too, luncheon -. Is usually such a
light repast that the -expert chafing-dish
fiend can manage nicely. If the .dishes
are dainty and the service halfway fair
what one has to" eat dolft seem to count
so awfully much, t ' . . -,rr - .
Hurry up, girls, ; and learn how to make
an egg: turn over without any . assistance.
Some people claim that" it can be done.
The "bach" who , fives a chafing-dish
lunch has a very delicate proposition on
his hands. 'Are his guests; to.be lasting
friends or enemies? Fortunately some
people claim
Small cheer and 'great welcome ' â¢/
Make a merry fe&st.'^. '.
Any one who can cook on a regular
range can't always make a success with
this toy stove. It takes practice, , a dex
terous hand and an eagle eye, else e\'ery
thing will go up in smoke. , The bache
lors claim to shine in this way, and think
they can give the girls all kinds of lessons
in cooking, almost as interesting 'and' as
good as throwing flapjacks from a frying
pan, running around .the fire half a dozen
times and then catching them all beauti

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH
A CHAFING DISHA Princely Income.
She is rich and getting richer every day,
for she enjoys a great Income from her
book, '"Science luid Health"â the bible of
tho Christian Scientistsâ but money Is not
all. It is Bold at $5 a copy, costing per
haps $150, and every votary, yea, the pa
tient of every votary, must buy oneâ over
200,000 have been soldâ and she has other
sources .of income besides. And when a
new revision of her book is thought nec
essary the new version must be bought,
or how is eviPto ue fought and conquered?
It is copper-fastened with copyrights.
Mrs. Eddy has the business head of a
strong man if she has the outgiving gen
ius of an apoctle.
The large, impressive looking house she
lives in reflects this wealth frankly. It
Is reached by a mile or less of broad, pic
turesque road from the elm shaded streets
of Concord. That the road might be
made .pleasant for driving she gave a
large sum to the township. The body of
the building is like the traditional New
England farmhouseâ namely, an oblong
structure, with a smaller oblong or "L "
as it is locally called, at the end, but with
a difference. .An octagonal turret with a
spire is at the southeast corner, and a
larger octagon that forms, a bay for the
two upper stories and rests upon the por
tico is. as it were, embedded In the north
front. The, house has a body color â¢ of
palest green, with, ivory write trimmings
and dark roofing, and, as it stands back
about thirty feet from fhe road, looks at
tractive and cool. A granite archway,
with the inscription "Eddy,", and there
under. "Pleasant , View, "all in very large
modest capitals," gives upon the graveled
walk that leads direct to the hall door.
Carriages may enter and 1 leave by. low
wooden gates at either side of the arch
but ; the carriage of '.the mistress of
Pleasant View alone enters or â¢ leaves
And pleasant indeed is the view,
for the house looks down from- the'
ridge over a wide valleyâ the ': valley
of the Merrimacâ that -slopes away from' :
the back, lawn In'! a, sweep -of green, and
spreads over dotted farmland and wood
land to a distant horizon of purpling hill
and; mountain. It looks from .the , green '
ridge . far - across . the valley ' to the little
hamlet â¢ of - Bow, where Mrs.' Eddy Â¦Â¦ was
born. ' So beauty and sentiment and pr iSe
of Â¦ achievement * combine to make It de-
sdously.' and appears as if about to afl
dress me, but doesn't.
But the hall door opens with a wide
sweep ' and , tho - brown-eyed maid, now
wearing a very fetching smile of welcome,
eays "Come in." . . Â¦ .
Tho hall door cllck3 to behind me. We
cross a small outer vestibule and I ob
serve that there is a second heavy door,
which also clicks to. .We are now in the
hall,, which is not very wide. There ls^ a
parlor on each side.
Â¦ ."If you will take Â» off > your things you
can hang them there," indicating.* rack
some distance down the hall. - â¢.-
Pleasantly . ushered into â¢ the parlor on
the v right hand", the girl, still all smilesâ
the radiance of "orders"- in a. house of
order â says: . - . Â¦ . Â¦ -
VYou wish to see Mrs. Eddy? Very well,
if you will wait a moment." '
And here the lie was to be given to all
the reports of - feebleness.' At any. rate,
here \ would.' be frankness, that did not
fear to face-, the facts of wrinkles, . if
wrinkles * there were, and < what â¢ more
touching than mother's wrinkles when she
is over 80?' I would hear the 'flowing talk
of a -wonderful woman. I recalled glee
fully what tho somber Robinson had said
to me in i Concord. He, had talked -with
herâ not lately; no, they shut him: out
lately, but three years ago. Â¦ "She Just
went on in a stream, and I had only to
say yes and no, "and she so full; of cheer
fulness and cleverness." /
Five minutes .went by. Â¦
The .parlor was " not : very large. - It was
richly furnished in a puzzling style, bear
ing out what I y had heard about the gifts
of â¢ the - faithful being so showered upon
Mrs. Eddy that after . filling her .house
with them * i she , had to â¢ send . out a notice
in the '.Sentinel, -begging that no* more be
sent, as the house. was overflowing.", -It
would â¢not have -been a* bad 5 idea to stop
the gifts a little earlier, for your soulful

things,* but .who shall her insure good

jects : was somewhat : offset â¢Â¦ by i- their . ar

small . stands : still . cried â¢ out * to â¢* heaven.
There ,;was a .< â¢ little Â¦ Parian * bust Â¦ of
Shakespeare', and a little gray . toned plas

humbler : days Â¦ in ; house ' furnishing, . and

slrable to her. To the right of the house,
at a respectful distance,- is . the barn,
which . ulso has a prinked up classic
frontage to match the white Ionic pillars
of the portico. In it Bhe has "every kind
of a known carriage," according to the
awe-stricken whispur of the local driver.
Farther down the road, past a row of
dripping young hemlocks, is a hand
some house, in which the "help," <of
which there are Â¦ a dozen or . so, . are
housed. They have luxurious quarters,
as things go.
Now' these "help" deserve thus cherish
ing. They are all Christian Scientists and
devoted to their mistress. They are not
only, secretaries, coachmen, gardeners,
stewards, cooks, laundresses and waiting
maids, with apparently most. of the posi
tlans Interchangeable, but guardians <of
a shrine and servants of a mystery, who
keep tight lips and : watchful ; eyes where
watching is wanted, and avert their gazo
discreetly where it is not. They go about
their business" : with the movements of
automata while any. one, is looking/ but
they are plain, .everyday people other
wise, cheerful r~nd polite.
These matters were observed in several
drives thither in the driving rain. On the
occasion of the flrst'drive a pull at the
knob beside . Mrs. Eddy's hall" door
brought in reply a single. ; faint
stroke, and presently a; good looking
brunette serving maid, with searching
brown eyes. One saw at -once as she
partly opened the portal; and put. out her
head that she stood ' at the door ' of tho
Much Desired,, for her Jaw firmly set as
she asked , one' s business. Evidently she
is used to i turning < people ! away, and ' one
must be; firm -about that. Â¦ Stating that
the desire was to see Mrs. Eddy, butthat
a ; glimpse, of Mrs. Eddy's secretary,
a Mr. Frye,' would perhaps arrange ; tne
matter more for Mrs. Eddy's convenience,
I waited. ' ; '- ">.Â¦',..; Â¦;Â¦Â¦â¢'.:Â¦ ""'Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦'
Â¦-- The girl kept the brown eyes steadily on
nie and replied â¢ in a tone suggesting the
impious interruption of a sacrificial act: . Â¦-â¢;:
"But Mr.: Frye Is at dinner." . ,
'Well, v dinner,' even in .the world, of Soul,
is. to be respected, and it has some claims
on- the. tireless journalist, so a > card -was
handed " to â¢ the â¢ brown-eyed maid ; i the ; call
would be ' repeated later. The door closed
with the: sharp clicking of a spring lock.' '

. Re-enter the brown-eyed maid, agitated,
something of ' dismay on â¢ her face, and
passing one hand lightly through her hair,
as if to assure her appearance. Some
thing v.-iis the matter.
"You know," she began, stammering,
"Mrs. Eddy, expected youâ Mrs. Eddy ex
pected to see you, but. nowâ nowâ she
can'tâ she isâ busy."
VBusy? And Mr. Frye?"
'"Oh, he? Yesâ he is busy with her."
"Can't be seen, eh?" !
"Oh, I wouldn't dareâ I couldn't."
: "Well, perhaps he will let me know
somehow when I can see him and if Mrs.

"Oh, she expected â¢ to see you; indeed,
Bhe did, before she suddenly gotâ busy.
No doubt Mr. Frye will send you word."
Here was a puzzleâ "suddenly â¢ gotâ

to. me very shortly:
"Mr. Fire tu'.d me r to tell you that he

"How is everybody up there?'.' I asked.

Mr. Frye's Influence.
It developed, from town report, which,
of course, has its unreliabilities, that Air.
Fryeâ Calvin A. Fryeâ the secretary, was
gradually * assuming the' power of Mrs.
Eddy nnd was in training for her mantle
when It should please her to pass on Eii
jahwiee, and a .seclusion imitating hers
was gradually, being assumed. He prac
tically stands Â¦ between her and every
body else 4 . He is very much -in her con
fidence. Rumor had it also that Mrs.
Eddy has made him her heir, .with some
thing resembling an entail on her prop
erty, and that ne will be the next high
priest. A certain disappearance behind
'the- veil: was thought advisable for him
also. . Â¦ "-Â¦ i Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦'.-.. ; Â¦ â¢
A day passed. â¢ It still rained. The re
port: that Mrs. , Eddy, was dead, or had
been dead .for some time, was scouted in
Concord,' but some 'held that It was not
Mrs. Eddy who drove forth, rain' or shine,
every day, but % a living substitute. The
hint indeed of a wax figure was seriously
ventured. â¢ ......
In Concord .the Christian Scientists are
personae gratae. They .pay promptly and
have many interests there. The two dally
papers, the Patriots and the Monitor, are
said to be owned and controlled bi- them.
Mrs. Eddy lived in a house on State street
for .some time before 'the Pleasant View
place was bought, and while it,wa3 build
ing,' some . six or seven years ago. . Some
relatives named. Baker live in the town.
Mrs. Eddv is ; said v in : Concord to have a
son grown to man's 'estate,' 1 to whom she
is reputed to*, have' made large gifts in
cash and house property. He resides, 1 they
say, in the l .West.>- Her : adopted son, .who
was : a "healer" in Boston,- had a quarrel
with '.Mrs. Eddy some- years ago and left

â¢ Â¦Another thing came under notice. It Is
in Concord- naturally enough* that the
Christian Science souvenir silver spoon is
made, about which so much has [been said,
from time to time. I saw one/ And heard
about .them; Â¦ -The i news thatÂ»Mrs. Eddy
enjoys a : percentage, : on ; each one sold

-Yes, every Christian Scientist 'is expect
ed* s. to buy. one, as well as "Science and
Health,", but .."It is ridiculous to -say,"
said one of -those: interested, ."that^a" re-^
ligion should rest on the sale of books and

1 V
a dear Bpoon, with an Inscription on tna

Fulfllleth," which is a curious inscription
tor a spoon. *
Now came word from Boston mysteri
ously that it would be well to call early in
the morning and see Joseph Mann at the
Eddy house, so again in the rain we go.
"Joseph, Mann," said the brown-eyed
maid, "is down at the cottage, and says
he is too busy to come up." Â¦Â£?%:.
Heavens, what a busy place, and how
polite of Mr. Mann! Well, the cottage la
not far, but there appears to be no one in
It. At last a little hothouse behind ths
cottage i3 found; half a dozen men are in
It potting plants aa busy as may be. One
of them advances. He is ! of middle ago
and portly build, and wears a low-cut
vest, a white satin necktie, with a Chris
tian Science pin. and that class of reddish
brown Dundreary whiskers which always
suggest that the wearer is about to sing
a comic sontr.
"I am Joseph Mann," he says and I ex
plain. . . . ,
As I do I observe the coachman, who 19
Mr. Mann's brother, to be among the plant
potters,' and also a man with a long iron
gray mustache, who whisks away. Joseph
Mann isn't half a bad fellow, but he can
do nothing without Mr. Frye. I would bet
ter return and he will let me know. So,
again to town in the rain.
Mrs. Eddy Heard From.
About 2 in the afternoon a bugjry
splashes into Concord, and a man hands
me a ' big square envelope with a great
blue seal and is gone. I open it, and under
a lordly coat of arms in pale gold I read in
typewriting:
"Dictated. . â¢ Â¦ - ' APRIL 24, 1901.
"Dear Sir: I am. Indeed, sorry to dis
appoint you, but beg to say I nave not
time to give to the present mooted topics
relative to Christian Science, since It
makes mankind no wiser to Interchange
mere opinions on this subject. If in oho
or two hours I could give you sufficient
knowledge of Christian Science to demon
strate the truth of what I had said I
would give you this opportunity with
much pleasure, knowing that In turn you
could elucidate the principle whereof poo
ple are now speculating, and largely at
their own folly* Most truly,
"M. B. EDDY."
' Here was another puzzler. Mm.- Eddy
did not want to talk of, the "presont
mooted topics," but she would give me, as
I read the note, one or two hours of elu
cidatioa-of Christian Science. That waa
not precisely what I was seeking, but It
would be interesting, so out in the rain I
drove again. Alas! Mrs.. Eddy was out
driving.
"They will be back In about twenty m!n
ues." said the maid, so there was nothing
to do but drive away. Mr. Frye? He waa
on the box. Well, I shall see them after
all/ And as we drove toward the town,
sure enough, the carriage was coming.
A Dalr of, stout bays, drawing a low
square-bodied carriage, which my driver
styled a bus, was coming up the hill
through the rain. On the box were two
men, one man the burly coachman and
the other Frye. the secretary, a man with
a long gray mustache, surely he whom 'I
had seen whi3king out of the nothouaa
when I spoke to Joseph Mann. In the car
riage, as seen behind the veil of the slant
ing rain, was the figure. of an old lady,
white of hair and white of face, looking
straight ahead. .
.We returned to -the house in about a
quarter of an hour. Â»
v "Mrs. ! Eddy," said the brown-eyed girl,
"is too busy after her drive to see you."
So- was Mr;. Frye. Joseph Mann ap
peared and was sympathetic. .Yes, the
note might bear the- construction .that
Mrs. Eddy wanted to talk to me, but
whatever the note said, a conversation
with her was impossible now.- Why? Mr.
Mann wagged his Dundreary whiskers.
"You will see." said he. "there's an 'if*

Christian Science has passed. In a very
short time ax religions go. from the condi

with temples of stone In many cities, a
widespread organization and a following
of well to do people, variously estimated
at from a hundred thousand to a million
bcuIs. Itself the development by a
woman of the ideas of a curious old spec
ulator in mental processes, it has already
given birth to a number of similar "phil
osophies," "religions" and practices that
hang on to Its coat tails. Protesting
against old religions as tyrannies, and
making mind cure disease its test and its
glory, it now freely denounces as heretics
and schismatics the mental curists, mental
scientists and faith curists outside its as
sociation The foe of other Christian
churches, the enemy at the start of Popes
ar>d prelates, it is developing an embryo
prelacy and has a Pope of its own as
"infallible" as any extant, and who ex
acts an absolute obedience from the faith-
It* Pope goes among the "loyal" by the
simple title of Mother, which, as every
pchoolboy knows. Is the feminine of Papa.

Mrs. Mary Baker Glover Eddy Is the
Mother of the Christian Scientists,- the
discoverer. In the latter sense she. can
have no successors, but if a prophet sel
dom has a progeny of seers to succeed
him. a church ruler must obviously have
a successor if the church is to hold to
gether. Now. it is a glory to grow old in
a noble life, and it is a gentlewoman s
glory to grow old gracefully If haply she
consents to grow old at all. Many worthy
dames nowadays, without any Christian
Science to sustain them, and only the
magazine advertisements to fall back up
on, decline to allow old age any of its tinus
honored privileges. For many reasons
Mrs. Eddy should take what measures
are within reach to preserve a more or
less youthful appearanceâ she, the Apostle
of Eternal Youth. Â¦
But, alas! the years will not be denied.
There are unpleasantnesses no art can
cover. And the priestess must pass more
or less behind the veil if the unlovely
truth would be hid.
In a figurative if not an actual sense
Mrs. Eddy has passed behind the veil.
Remarkable Spread of the Cult.
Mormonism. in spite of its dubious
origin, failed of becoming more than a
local religion mainly because of its adop
tion of polygamy. It countered modern
civilization and the Caucasian religions in
that and w*Â»nt under outside Utah. Chrls
tia.n Science, in its attitude toward disease
and its pretensions to healing by mind
power, without other aid, has run foul of
the health laws la many Statesâparticu
larly in the matter cf Infectious diseases.
It seems liable to legal attack also where
Its members fail to call in physicians and
the death ensues of these In their charge.
Its "healers' have been excluded from
Georgia by law. So it runs a danger
from one cause as Mormonlsm did from
another.
Mcrmonism made a prophet of its foun
der. Christian Science is making a higher
claim for its discoverer.
It was tr.y fortune to interview Brlgham
Young at Salt Lake City fcr the Herald
just thirty years ago. and the impression
of clear-headedness and shrewdness he
made has proved lasting. He had no
illusions; took no pains to appear a
prophet when he was not prophesying In
the Tabernacle. Mrs. Mary Baker Glover
l;ddv is said to have just as hard a busi
ness head and to keep all illusions out of
her bookkeeping. Will her institution
chow the vigor that Mormonism does a
quarter of a century after the demise of
its founder?

Mother for years and never may *~nm l*

For Mrs. Eddy is more than 80, most
people agree. Some say she is 85, though
according to another calculation she Is
only 77â but feeble, whatever her age.
She has never been, it is said for her, a
lever of display or cared for personal
worship face to face. At any rate, for
seven or eight years- past she has sedu
lously avoided public appearances. Two
or three years ago she traveled to Boston,
appeared on a platform and spake there
to her people. The s!pn of age then most
marked waa a trace of senile palsy in her
hands. Since then she has been more se
cluded than ever. Like the Pope in th*
Vatican fhe has . busied, herself with her
church affairs and. her garden. She has
confined her outings to solitary drives In
the neighborhood of her home. Some
time!?, pay the people of Concord town,
she drives out in a close carriage, some
times in an open one. If the weather Is
warm and fair. In the latter case fihe is
wont to carry a small parasol, which she
generally drops before her face as sine
parses people, though the homes are
usually driven at a smart trot. Rain or
shlrfe, hot or cold, the carriage goes forth
and return*.
Strange stories have grown up. It Is
not Mrs. Eddy, but a doubleâ a woman

Is Mrs. Eddy in good health? Is any
one else grooming for the position of

These were questions worth, perhaps, a

and discretion, for one would not pry
heedlessly or ask to know more than the
simple facts. The outcome waa humor

Mrs. Eddy, so far as was then con
cerned, was to remain behind the veil. .
It Is only a matter of less than, nine
years since Christian Science first took on
its present churchiy shape. There had
been a previous attempt in April, 1879. at
launching the religion in church form, but
it appears to have practically failed, lor
in September, 1892, occurred the real'"get
ting together," when, to quote the Chris
tian Science Church Manual, "at lie re
quest of the Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy,
twelve of her students and church mem
bers met and reorganized, under her juris
diction, the Christian Science Church, and
named it the First Church of Christ, Sci
entist." At this meeting twenty others of
Mrs. Eddy's students and members of her
former church were elected members of
this church. . " Â¦ â¢
. First on the list of the elect of that day
was Calvin A, Frye. Stick a pin In that,
and reflect that he is closest of all to Mrs.
Eddy now, and as desirable on that ac
count, In a minor, degree, to see as the
founder. ..
Small Beginnings. *
Mrs. Eddy was not by any means a poor
apostle In' 1892, when the present church
was started. According to her own state
ment, having founded in 1881 a Boston in
stitution, called the MasnachunettB Meta
physical College, she taught 4000 students
In It, sending them forth as "healers" dur
ing the ensuing seven years. It was a
cheap affair to run. The cqurse is repre
sented as consisting of lectures, mostly by
Mrs. Eddy, during thirty r half days, and
the fee is stated to "have been $300. This
looks like producing $1,200,000 In the seven
years, Allowing for a liberal discount on
the round . numbers and .the fee, large
amounts were gained, Mrs, Eddy-shut
up her college in lSKO. "In the height of its
prosperity," she saysâ as Is usual with
eolh-gesr-and started In to revlea her book,

according to an official. biography, once in
1S43, "to Colonel George W. Glover of
Charleston; S. C, and after his death to
Dr. Asa G. Eddy of Chelsea. Mass." "Dr.
Eddy," the narrative says dryly, "died in
1882." There should, it seeros to the casual
observer, be a, little more about Dr. Eddy,
for he surely came within the- great pe
riod and gave the lady the name by which
she will go down to posterity. 'The date
of Mr. Glover's departure is not set down,
but it 13 said to have been. not long after
his marrlagre. Yet. ?ne'e husbands are,
after all. mere mortal details in a spirit
region where soul is everything. ,What Is
materfal now is that Mrs. Eddy was. born .
somewhere between 1816 "land 1824, Jn the
woodland hamlet of Bow, near -Concord, >
N. H. . She came of Puritan parents, Mark
Baker being her father's name and Abi
gail B. Baker her mother's. They-christ
ened her Mary Baker. She cornea of fight
ing blood, for she claims as ancestors
General John Macneil of Lundys Lane;
General Henry Knox' of revolutionary
fame; Captain John Lanewell, an Indian .
fighter, nnd Sir John Macneil, "a British
Embassador to Persia." Combative^there
fore, on one side, her Puritnn ancestry
gave her that turn for spiritual wrestling
which begets religions and Isms, in New
England as naturally as a sea fog. begets
collisions off the coast; Joseph Smith,'
who founded Mormonlsm, was born In
Vermont, and Quimby was a Now Hamp

To guard the King's person and Insure
his safety a pilot engine is sent fifteen
minutes ahead of every royal train and
the lines are cleared of traffic fifteen min
utes in advance. To any one in any way
connected with the working of the train
a special time table 1* supplied. It. states
the exact time that the royal train will
pass or stop at each station and full par
ticulars of the stoppage of certain other
trains, and many other rules and regula
tions must be strictly adhered to. All
shunting operations on Ridings near the
main line must be stopped at least half
an hour before the train is due. Nothing

Precautions Taken.
The Jubilee train cost $200,000 and the
private saloon $30,000. The curtains are
hung upon silver poles, which are sus
pended upon fcmall gilt figures costing ten
guineas each. The carpet in this luxuri
ously fitted carriage cost 1750, while the
door handles are said to have cost the
same sum.
In Great Britain every 'line of conse
quence has its royal train, and King Ed
vard VII has this legal rteht to travel
euywbere at will free of cost. The royal
train proper, and the one most generally
used by trie iaie Queen Victoria, was built
at Swindon works. Her Majesty first trav
t-led in it from Windsor to London on the
occasion of ihe jubilee in 1S97. This train
is composed of six carriages, the total
length of which is 363 feet, and it Is put
together with the royal saloon in the cen
ter, two saloon carriages, one at each end
of the royal carriage, one nrst-class car
riage and two brake vans, one at each
end of the train.
The King's car Is fifty-four feet long
and the saioon compartment, in the cen
ter, has a domed roof. At each end of the
carriage are compartments and lavatories
for the suite. The carriage Is finished In
satinwood, with panels of sycamore; the
domed roof is decorated with Jions and
crowns in green and gold; all the metal
fittings are silver plated, and under the
carpets in the royal compartment and ves
tibule is a layer of cork. The steel under
frame is cased with mahogany and on
each corner is a curved lion's head, with
ciown.
At one end of each carriage is a com
partment for the railroad officials. These
carriages are finished with walnut fram
ing and sycamore panels, and the metal
fittings are gold lacquered. The roots are
finished with white and gold and the elec
tric light globes are of cut glass.
The royal compartment as upholstered in
French white silk corded rep. with green.'
white and gold silken tassels, heavy
deep fringe, cords, gimps, bosses, all with
a woven "rose, shamrock and thistle" pat
tern on the laces, and it. is hung with
preen silk curtains and blinds, edged with
preen and white cord and gimpy laces. The
carpet is green and white heavy pile che

An amusing incident happened during
one of the iate Queen's railway journeys
a few years ago. The train had to pass
a certain farm on the way, and the far
mer and his family and all the farm ser
vants gathered at an adjacent level cross
ing to gaze at the train as if passed. One
boy, with loyal intentions, had secured
his mother's best scarlet shawl to wave
as a flag, and he ran forward to a little
hiil near the crossing to get the /first
glimpse of the train. At last it came In
sight, and the youngster shpute<1 and
cheered, waving his flag frantically.
.Imagine the surprise of the people wh?n
the royal train slowed and stopped. In
an Instant a railway official had seized
the boy and cried: Â¦
"Down with that shawl! Don't you
know you are stopping the royal train!"
The driver had taken it as a signal of
danger. Her Majesty wac "iuch amused.
How the Czar Travels.
The Russian imperial train Is. without
doubt, the most co3tly in the world. In
Its Interior furnishing- it surpasses In mag
nificence the train de luxe lately built for
the German Emperor, one of the most
luxuriously furnished trains that ever ran
over the iron road. Some idea of its splen
dor man be had wl-en it is stated that
$500,000 has been spent upon it. It is a
palace on wheels. It consists of eleven
carriages. The royal carriages are in the
center of the train.
The walls of the drawing-room are cov
ered with pale rose silk, while the royal
bedchamber is hung with light blue satin,
the furniture being covered with cretonne
of the same color. Each Â¦ of the sleeping
saloons has a bedchamber attached, as
well as a dining-room. The dining saloon
is upholstered with chamois leather.

. In Germany when royalty travels sched

go by the board. At Frankfort one even

minute.* after starting time. Hundreds ot
passengers were fretting and fuming, a*
they had to make other railroad connec
tions, but could'get no explanation of the
delay. Finally a "saloon" car was coupled
to our train, a roll of bright carpet was
laid, a section of- the platform was
cleared." some hothouse palms were put
out and then anotherâ a local train from
somewhere or otherâ pulled In, and with,

SACRAMENTO," May 25.â After leaving
San Francisco this morning the Presi
dential train ran through crowds at all
the stations. Minute stops were made at !
Port Costa and Tracy, at each of whicn -
places the President shook hands with: a .

CROWDS AT ALL STATIONS.
Until the train disappeared from view the
figure of the President'could.be seen wav- .
ing adieu. -. . ' . ; , i
a chair close to the steps of the carriage.
At the Oakland mole a crowd of about
409 women and children had assembled,
hoping for a view of the distinguished
travelers. The railroad police caused con
siderable confusion by their frantic efforts
to keep the small number of sightseers
et a distance, and their rough actions
caused much comment. Children 100 feet
awny from the President's train were
roughly forced from points of vantage by
burly officers, and but for the arrival of
the ferry-boat there might- have, been a
email riot. As it was, the people fell into
orderly lines as soon as the first carriage
emerged from the ferry slip.
The President's train of eight Pullman
cans was backed Into the depot shortly
before lu o'clock. The President's car,
"Olympia," was the rear one and was
filled with fragrant flowers sent by
Xrlends in San Francisco and Oakland.
At 10:35 a. m. the /erry-boat reached the
Oakland mole and the carriages were
driven Into the depot. First came the car
riages containing the Cabinet members
and their ladies. Then the President's
jnounted police escort clattered from the'
ferry-boat into the depot shed, closely
iollowed by the President's carriage,
which was driven close to the rear steps
of the car "Olymoia."
X>r. Rlxev was the first to alight and
rave directions to the attendants to place
Small Crowd at the Mole.
As early as 8 o'clock yesterday morning
crowds began to gather in the vicinity <3f
the Bcott residence. The curious multi
tude took up its stand In Lafayette Park,
facing the Scott residence, and awaited
the departure of President and Mrs. .Mc-
Kinley. A large squad of police under the
personal command of Chief Sullivan kept
the crowd back and the streets clear in
the immediate vicinity of the President's
temporarj' residence.
The newspaper men who had watched
the house during the stay of the President
tmd his -wife eagerly awaited their ap
pearance. Camera men were not to be
Been. The President had requested that
the newspaper men forego photographing
his wife, and they to a man heeded his
request. Not 60 the amateur pho
tographers. They crowded the park and
Â¦were ready to level their cameras at the
house, but alert policemen warned them
that they might have their boxes smashed
If they did not get beyond range.
Promptly at 9:15 the doors of the Scott
residence were thrown wide open and
Urs. McKinley was carried out to the
Trailing carriage. She was propped up in
f p.n Invalid's chair and was carried to the
' -waiting vehicle by two Pullman car por
ters. The President walked by her side
end looked careworn and serious.
Mr. McKinley gracefully lifted his hat
to the officers and newspaper men who
Etood on the eldewalk with uncovered
heads as a mark of deep respect for the
Buffering wife of the chief Executive.
Mrs. McKinley Seemed Feeble.
Sirs. McKinley chowed signs of the se
vere Illness through which Ehe has passed,
and words of pity burst Involuntarily
from the lips of those who caw her. She
Â¦was pale and feeble and looked to be too
HI to undergo the long Journey to "Wash
ington. President McKinley entered the
Carriage first so as to be ready to assist
his wife, who was tenderly lifted Into the
conveyance by the porters. Dr. Rlxey,
her phy6lcian,j.ook his seat opposite Mrs.
McKinley, and the President pulled down
the blinds bo that- no one could look upon
the suffering wife. The large crowd re
snalned respectfully silent, and as the long
procession of carriages moved down the
etreet dispersed.
Coachman King drove down the asphalt
cm paved streets at a pace that would
not Jar the Invalid. "When the cavalcade
arrived at the *erry fully 2000 people were
on hand to give the distinguished visitors I
godspeed on their Journey. They were i
Â«Â£J5 appointed, however, as the closed car- |
rlage was driven Inside the gates and the
party took passage on the ferry-boat Oak
land. The President's visit to San Fran
cisco had passed into history.
Crowds Gather Early.
PRESIDENT AND MRS. McKIN
LET, accompanied by the mem
bers of the Cabinet and others
of the Presidential party, de-,
parted from San Francisco for
the East yesterday moraine: at
10 o'clock. All along the route
frcm the Scott residence at Clay and La
guna etreets to the ferry building "thou
sands watched the closely guarded, swift
ly moving carriage containing the chief
executive and his wife.
' Jso cheering marked the progress of the
President and Mrs. McKinley through the
streets. There was enthusiasm . in the
crowds, but It was of a silent nature. Hats
and handkerchiefs were waved, but not a
voice was raised. All traffic was tem
porarily suspended not by an order of the
police but as a matter of courtesy by the
drivers of teams and wagons and the
grlpmen and motormen of street cars.
At the ferry building a large force of
police kept the way to the boat clear. The
carriage was driven on to the Oakland,
Â¦which had been specially reserved to con
vey the Presidential party across the bay.
and a few minutes past 10 o'clock the
etemner left her slip and headed for the
Oakland mole.
The cresrs of the warships lying close
to the track of the ferry-boat formed In
lines on their decks, but no sound of guns
rrarked the progress of the President
ecroES the bay. The trip to the mole was
uneventful, and nothing disturbed the
comfort of Mrs. McKinler-

the prospects are that a gigantic combi
nation will be formed with a capitaliza
tion of probably $50,000,000. . The trusts in
the three States will be under different
organizations, but. it is said, they all may
be financed by the same source, â¢ which
will make it equivalent to one combina
tion, as the object- of the three will ba
identical. John S. Bays of Sullivan. Ind.,
who represents the trust promoters in this
State, says the proposed combination
probably will be .known as the Indiana
Consolidated Coal â¢ Company, and will
have headquarters somewhere near the
center of the fleld3. The minimum capital
stock will be $10,000,000. and It will be In
corporated under the laws of this State.
The trust probably will close down a num
ber of mines temporarily, as the large
operators assert that there is at this timo
an overproduction. Options ' have Â¦ now
been obtained on over twenty of the
twenty-four large companies of the State.
According to Mr. Bays, arrangements
have already been made to finance the

SAN JOSE, May 25.â The -""Passion
Play" that is to be presented at r the
trolden Jubilee exercises of; Santa Clara
College on May 31 and June -3 promises
to rival the great production of Ober
ammergau,* for which thousands .journey
long ; distances to see the story r of the
Nazarene illustrated. It is predicted the
Santa Clara production â¢, will become
equally as famous on this coast and will
become an annual event. Attention has
been attracted to the play from all over
the State -and the demand for tickets ; is
tar ahead of what was expected. A spe
cial train will be run trom San : Francisco
on June 3 for- the benefit of, the residents
of that city. - . â¢
The Santa Clara "Passion : Play" is al
together unique. Many attempts have
been made to dramatize and stage "tha
story that transformed the world," but
with*'the exception of the Oberammer-
Bau. production they have ' all been fail
ures. The chief difficulty lies in the im
personation of the character of the man
god, and this difficulty can be. obviated
only by one of two .ways â either the'per
son who takes the nart of Christ must in
person; and by characteristics be 1 peculiar
ly adapted to the part, or the, role of the
protagonist must be omitted. Oberammer
gau has chosen- the former way. and Santa
Clara the latter. .' - â¢
\ The form. of the play also is remark
able. Clay M. Greene, the well-known
playwright, is the author and he has evi
dently created ; a \. masterpiece. Four
epochs and ten chapters make up the
story. Electrical devices â¢ and fine scen
ery have been procured, and th* staging
of the piece .will equal that of any play
ever presented on this coast. ..
The music will be magnificent. Rev.
Father Sesnon of San Rafael, assisted by
a chorus and an orchestra, will sing, the
choicest and most appropriate pieces as
preludes to the different epochs or 'acts.

credited with 30 5-6 points, which gave the
second place to her, and Princeton came
in third with a total of 16 1-6 points. To
the surprise of the spectators Cornell took

â¢ SAN JOSE, May 25.â The circle of mu
sicians in this city has been agog the past
week over the. breaking of ; an. engagement
on' the eve of "marriage between â¢* Louis
Knell, the leader of the Fifth. Regiment
ba'nd, and M^es Stella Folsom,; who.was
an original member of the ladies' band of
this city. To-morrow nad been chosen as
the wedding day! To-night Knell 'occu
pies, a cell in the County Jail, charged
with stealing $S0 from his employer.
About a year ago Knell came -to tnis
city from Los Angeles. He is "an excellent
musician, and In local musical circles he
met Miss Fol3om. a pretty and estimable
young woman. An engagement followed.
Knell, who was employed as a day clerk
at the New York Exchange, became lead
er of the Fifth Regiment band a short
time ego. Miss Folsom, who is cashier at
the Mercantile restaurant, notified her
employer. a couple of weeks ago that she'
intended to resign. Her wedding trous
seau was all leady and arrangements
were made for the ceremony.
A few days ago . friends of the young
lady told her that Knell was, not all he
professed to beâ that. he had been arrest
ed in Los Angoles for embezzlement and
that similar charges were about to be pre
ferred against him here. Miss Folsom at
once broke off the engagement, but re
fused to give her friends any reason.
Knell left town for a day or two, but
returned last night. To-day Henry Roehr,
manager of the New York Exchange,
swore to a warrant before Justice Wal
lace charging Knell with having embez
zled $80 while in his employ. , Knell was
arrested this evening. and is in jail in de
fault of $2000 bail. Friends of the pretty
girl, musician are now congratulating her
on her/tiarrow escape from a bad mar
riage. . â¢

.A SEVERE CASE
Of .Catarrh of the Stomach
Cured by Pe-ru-na.
Mr. Otto Jordan, Argos. Ind.. wrlteÂ»:
. VI. can state to you chat, all the symp-"
tom3 of catarrh have disappeared since I
commenced taking Peruna, and I shall
give it all the praise. I took four bottles
of the' medicine- , For a loner time beforo
I took the medicine I felt dull and stupid,
was subject to sick stomach and dizziness.
Since the first bottle I have not been
troubled with my stomach and have been
greatly benefited all around. I think any-
body troubled with catarrh would be bene-
fited by the use of your medicine."â Otto
Jordan. Â¦Â¦
The Secret of Pure Blood.
No one can be troubled long with indi-
gestion and have pure blood, for. however
careful one may be in tha selection of
proper food. If it is not 'properly digested
it will not furnish the blood with pure ma-
terials.
For this condition Peruna is a never-
falling . remedy. It cleanses the blood by
correcting digestion, and gives tone to the
whole system by increasing the nutrltiva
value of the food. "Spring: fever," as it is
sometimes called; which produces a tired-
out, sleepy feeling. 'and inability to da
much mental or physical work, la tha re- .
suit of a sluggish digestion, and no blood
medicine will be of any use whatever un-
less it is able to rectify the impaired 'di-
gestion. " The great popularity that Peruna
has is due to the fact that in all such
cases it at once corrects digestive de-
rangements and enriches the blood by
purifying this very Important source of.
that vital fluid.
A Tonic and Catarrh Cure.
Mr. TV. M? Holland, of Hartwell. Ga..
proprietor of the Hartwell Tin Works. '
writes of Peruna as follows:
"I am more than pleased with the bene-
fits derived from Peruna. The winter of
1899 my. weight was 150 pounds. I used
several bottles during the winter and now
weigh 211.
"I have recommended it to all my
friends both as a tonic and catarrh cure.
If I had been lucky enougn to have seen
it several years ago Peruna would havs
saved me much inconvenience."â W. ii.

train on which Governor George K. Nash
and party traveled to San .Francisco to at
ten-1 the launching of the battleship Ohio
arrived here this morning over the Hock.
ing Valley Railway. The members of the
party were In good spirits. Governor Nash
looked old and broken and was so weak
that he had to be supported as he walked
to his carriage. The Governor said, he
would soon be all right, .but his intimate
friends express doubt . of a speedy re
covery. Â¦
I Members of the party say the reports of
friction with the Presidential party at Los
Angeles were exaggerated. Governor Nash
said the people of Los Angeles were over
whelmed by the arrival of two Ohio par
ties. Julius Whiting of Canton, a close
personal friend of the President, said the
Southern Pacific held up the Ohio party
for fifteen hours to clear the road for the
Presidential party, but r lt was not directed
at any particular party.

much that he. wants to be her owner?

Subjects of the Kaiser Are
Anxious^ to End the
China Affair.
BERLIN, May 25.â The declarations of
Count Goluchowskl, the Imperial Minister
of Foreign Affairs, before the Austro-
Hung-arian delegates have created intense
interest here. They were received in the
main with satisfaction, as expressing con
tinued and cordial faith In the triple alli
ance; but his reference to commercial re
lations, intimating that they must not be
seriously disturbed if political friendship
Is to continue, is here interpreted as a
plainer hint than 1b usually given from
Vienna that Germany must not yield far
to tha agrarians.
Other points mentioned by the Czech
and Polish leaders here are considered un
important, especially as Hungary in uni
son favors continued cordial friendship
with Germany. The press points out that
the Russo-Austrian understanding regard
ing the Balkans is still valid, henoe seri
cub disturbances there are Improbable.
The case of Queen Drags, of Servia Is
almost universally regarded in Germany
from Its commercial side. Official circles
deny that tbe affair Is fraught with seri
ous political Import. The newspapers
throughout the week have printed many
anecdotes and some amusing correspond
ence from Servia. Several German com
mercial authorities consider that Queen
Draga's health may improve In view of
the fact that she has been sent to Franz
en&bad. â¢ .
The feeling throughout Germany of
tiredness of the China war still continues,
and now includes even the .Emperor, who,
during Count von Billow's visit to the
Reichland, was thoroughly informed re
garding tha present status of affairs in
China and thereupon agreed with the
Chancellor that it was best to effect the
withdrawal of the German forces as
quickly as possible and reach some under
standing: in regard to paying the Indem
nity. This conclusion, it Is said, was hast
ened because, In contradiction of the semi
official statements on the subjeot, Rus
sia's attitude in China recently has be?
come outspokenly hostile to Germany ana
the danger seemed Imminent of a serious
clashing there.
Among the Germans returning from
China will be Emperor William's special
ly deputed battl* scene painter, Theodore
Rocholl, wlio Is laden with numberless
sketches made on the spot, from which
his Majesty will order score* of paintings
to be executed. Herr Rochoil has partly
finished two fine .paintings showing the
body of Colonel York von Wartemburg' be
ing delivered at the Shatow, and also the
funeral of Von Wartenburg in Peking.

j Tha canners have , Insisted upon the
province taking hold of . the administra
tion of affairs because Dominion has
heretofore put all revenues Into the gen
eral treasury and the fisheries of the
Fraser River have not been improved to
the 'extent of. even a 'fifth of the revenue
directly derived ' from the big canning
business. Already '2500 licenses have been
issued by the Dominion : to fishermen at
$10' each. The new regulations' of the
province reduce the cost ; of a -license to
$2 50, and 'provide that the remainder of
the previous revenue - be made up by a
special levy on the canners' -' pack. A
board of commissioners composed of rep^
iesentatives of the canners and the fisher
men Is to regulate fisheries and admin
ister affairs for the province. ,- '
On the other hand, the labor' leaders of
the fishermen are strongly taking the side
of the Dominion. They belllye that the
Federal- authorities are .determined not to
give up control of the fisheries, especially
as there are two large fishery cruisers
now here fitting out for the protection of
Dominion interests. According to a long
established precedent JDominlon authority
extends over tidal waters and provincial
authority over rivers and lakes. The. po
sition now is that the fishermen must buy
both provincial ' and Dominion licenses
when . fishing around the mouth of the
If raser River and In the Gulf of Georgia,
or else be liable to have their boats and
outfits seized by one or the other of. the
fishery cruisers. /.": â¢. -. :; ,.. : \
Leading fishermen are "of the opinion
that there will be another strike this year.
The men want 15 cents per fish guarantee
for the season, while the canners are talk
ing 10 cents, and they are now no nearer a
solution than they were a month ago.
Â¦VANCOUVER. B. C, May 25.â The offi
cial announcment . that . a serious clash In
authority has occurred between. the prov
ince and ', the Federal administration will
be contained in an extra of the Provincial
Gazette on Monday morning. For some
time c there have been' strained relations
between the two governments over the
valuable salmon fisheries of the Fraser
River. Now the provincial executive has
taken the defiant action of seizing the In
dustry and its control and attempting its
administration. With, this trouble and
considerable difficulty between the-'oan
nerymen - and fishermen the outlook for
the season is not promising. Â¦ Â¦ . Â»

May 2&â The King's escape
at the time of the accident on board the
Shamrock II last Wednesday has, if any
thing, added to his popularity. "With what
tact his ' Majesty preserves the happy re
lations between himself and his subjects
can be judged from an Incident thaf oc
curred this week. Colonel, the Honorable
Charles Elliot, whose friendship with the
King dated from the time of the royal
visit to America, when Colonel Elliot act
ed as the - mentor of the then Prince of
Wales, lay dying at the Sports Club.
Colonel Elliot had not had any intimate
relations with the King for -many years;
but his Majesty, hearing of the soldier's
condition., immediately drove to the club,
got out and inquired sympathetically for
his former friend, and these visits were
continued dally' until Colonel Elliot died.
Prinoees Christian also called at the club,
for Elliot was formerly a member of .her
household. She walked straight to * his
room, said a few words and kissed the
dying 1 roan's hand.
Cervera Fears for Spain.
MADRID, May 25:â Speaking before the
naval congress yesterday on the subject
whether or not Spain should be a naval
power, Admiral Cervera expressed fears
of the disintegration of Spain Into a num
ber of smaller states.
"I do not wish," he said, "that the in
terests of the navy should predominate at
the expense of the other Interests of the
country, but, observing, as I do, what is
going on at the present day, I am afraid
Spain may become like the Italy of the

RYE, N. T.. May 25.â Flndlay S. Doug
lass of the Nassau Club, Long Island, won
the Metropolitan golf championship this
afternoon on the links of the Apawamis
Club, defeating Charles H. Seeley of the
"Weeburn Golf Club, Stamford. Conn., by
11 up and 10 to play. Rain fell continually.
Seeley's showing was disappointing 1 , as
Douglass clearly outplayed him. Doug
lass was lucky, however, as he- had a ten
dency to hook his drives, but; f ortunately
for himself, he was not punished by bad
lies, as his ball always landed in a playa
ble spot. On the other hand, Seeley drove
heavy straight, but his -work on the put
ting green was not up to the form he ex
hibited yesterday.
In the morning round of eighteen holes
Douglass finished 6 up, and in the after
noon it reouired the playing of only 8
more holes to decide the match. The first
three of these were won by Douglass, the
fourth going to Seeley in two less than
the bogey. Douglass won the fifth in five
to six and the sixth was halved in sixes.
Douglass won the next two In five to six
and four to elx, respectively, and this fin
ished the match. Following are the carda

Keene's'Cohroy, the first three-year-old
to'/wih a Brooklynâ handicap, cantered
home a; winner at the Gravesend racetrack'
to-day- with odds* of. 4 'to 1 against him.'
Herbert finished second, with Standing in
third- position. .. The favorite; Banastar.'
was away back in the ruck, unable to get
up his speed in the heavy, going.
, A more disagreeable day for the Brook
lyn handicap could not have been imag
ined. 'Â¦Â¦ From early morning the rain had
been coming: down with Â¦ now " and'- then
clearing signs which gave promise of fair
weather bv the time the great race was
run. /The first three races were run under
lowering clouds. The five runners in. the
Expectation stakes had hardly finished,
however, when 'the rain came down' in
"earnest and the big event was pulled off
in a driving: rain. â¢
In spite of the threatening weather there
was a big crowd at the track, fully 115,000
Â¦people watching the struggle in the rain.
At 4:15, o'clock, when the bugle called the
handicap horses to the post, the track was
like a quagmire. Banastar was a consist
ent favorite all the time, with - Conroy
second choice and Sydney Lucas, Herbert
and- Raff aello well backed. The candidates
were applauded as they cantered up to the
turn, Banastar in the lead.
Five times did the.- starter try to get
them away and as many, times did they,
decline to go in good order. On the sixth
attempt, however, the horses got off in
sood style. Banastar was first to 6how,
with. Herbert and Raffaello next in line
and Conrov close up. Around the turn
they rushed. They had gone but a few
strides when O'Connor sent the three
year-old Conroy to the front and he came
with puch a rush that he was two open
lengtns to the good as he passed the
judges' stand for the first time. Banastar
vat, in second 'place, Herbert and Stand
.lne- lapping him: -Without slackening
speed in the least and with the mud fly
ing, they scampered around the lower
Â¦ turn, Conroy holding his advantage. Ban
astar had been passed by Herbert and
Standing and was half a length behind
Â¦tnem. â¢ â¢ ... â¢ Â¦ .-
Coming into the backstretch Smith sent
Herbert after Conroy, and foot by foot
he began to cut ' down the lead of the
three^year-old. Standing and Banastar
began. to close-up, too, and as the upper
turn was reached it looked as If the
youngster already had his measure taken.
O'Connor, however, was on the alert and
still had a. good hold on Keene's horse.'
The leaders rushed into the turn. Just
for one instant did Banastar show a flash
of the speed which he exhibited in the
Brooklyn handicap of two years ago â only
the conditions were so different â but it
did not last and he began to drop back.-
Herbert by this time was on even terms
with Conroy, and Standing was but a
length away and they were turning into
the stretch for the final rush. '- O'Connor
on Conroy then crouched low on his
mount and went to work.. Conroy gamely
responded to the jockey's appeal, and in
a- few- jumps left Herbert, as if he were
standing- still. In the twinkle of an eye
he was a couple of lengths in front and in
a â¢ few- bounds more, as far as. the rest
were concerned, the, contest, was. over, for,
struggle as,they might, they! never could
catch Conroy, and .the latter, pulling up'
strongly,'. can teredi past -the judges' stand
jLhe easiest kind of a winner by a length
and a half from' Herbert, who was'twice
that distance in front of Standing, and the
others badly, beaten. The cheering at the
; conclusion \: of .'.the j race =i was Â» tremedous.

' PRACTICE CONFINED TO
DISORDERS OF THE MALE.
Sffiri^ -''
WEAJCNESS
Tbero Is no such condition a.Â« weakness In Â¦
man under fifty years of age. other than gen-
eral debility. Prematureness. loss of vitality,
etc., are but symptoms, of some damatr- to th*
reproductive system cauoed by a contracted
disorder or early dissipation. .. In looking for the
location of this damage we generally find an
enlarged, swollen and Inflamed prostate gland.
As this gland Is . the very . center of the re-
productive system It can readily be understood
that Inflammation of It must cause disordered
function. The cases are promptly benefited by
proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes
from bad to Â»/orse. The -essential point In all
of them Is the necessity of the cure of the focus .
of the. trouble. In the prostate. Many men who
â¢ have unsuccessfully treated for a weakness
should now know the cause of failure. In our
experience there Is no drug In the Fhartna-
copea. taken Into the stomach, that will even
benefit this class of cases. Our plan of treat-
ment is entirely a local one, and prompt results
are obtained, as Indicated by Increased cireu-
lation and return of natural vigor. Our colored
chart, which we mail on application. Is inter-
esting to any one wishing: to study the anatomy
of the male. t
Varicocele.
' Varicocele Is an â¢ enlargement of the most
vital blood vessels In man. In their normal
condition' their function- ia to carry eff waste'
material, thus enabling, the organs to receive
fresh nutrition. Owing: to the breaking down
of the valves, caused by tha paralysis of thÂ«
1 muscular coat of the veins, they become dilated. >
1 and local stagnation' of the blood follows. Tha '.
vital â¢ nerves, . being deprived of their proper (
quality and quantity of nourishment, weakness
is the result. Statistics prove that 23 per cent
of the male population are. afflicted with vari-
cocele In some stage of the disease. TVs guar- *
an tee to cure varicocele In one .week at our
office, or four weeks of home treatment, with-
out th* use of knife, caustic or ligature. We
have cured, over 2000 cases without a single
failure or unpleasant result. We Invite cor-
respondence and the fullest Investigation of our
method, ' and can refer to cured patients u
desired. KBlM

REVISIONISTS
GAIN A VICTORY
Â»
Minority Report Rej ected
by Presbyterian As-
sembly.
PTTTT.A-n-CT.PTTTA, May 25.â The Pres-
byterlan General Assembly to-day took
another step toward revising: the confes-
elon of faith by rejecting: the. minority re-
port, which had been offered as a substi-
tute amendment for the majority report.
Tbo vote was 271 to 231. ThÂ© recommenda-
tion Is as follows:
"(b) We recommend that a committee
be instructed to prepare a brief summary
of the reformed faith, bearing the same
relation to the confession which the
shorter catechism bears to the larger
catechism and formed on the general
model of the consensus creed prepared for
the General Assembly of 1892, or the arti-
cles of faith of the Presbyterian church
of England, both of which documents are
appended to the committee's report and
submitted to the assembly to be referred
to the committee appointed."
TVith the consent of the assembly the
zsotlon was changed so that the vote was
taken on the question of striking; out the ,
recommendation from the majority report
instead of accepting the minority report
iib a substitute, purlng the discussion of
the subject Moderator Mlnton gave the
gavel to Vice Moderator Pltcairn while he
addressed the commissioners in favor of
the amendment. Dr. Mlnton said the rec-
ommendation meant simply the establish-
ment of a new creed.
After the announcement of the vote the
Rev. Dr. J. G. MofTatt informed the as-
sembly that on Monday he would present
an amendment with the object of uniting
the commissioners in order that a unani-
mous recommendation might be sent to
the presbyteries.
The Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson presented
an amendment favoring the retention of
the recommendation, analyzing the con-
feesion of faith, demonstrating the neces-
sity for changes In certain clauses and
showing the benefits to be derived there-
from. Numerous doubtful commissioners
were brought over to the ranks of the re-
visionists by Dr. Johnson's address.
An effort was made to postpone the vote
until Monday, but the commissioners be-
came impatient and insisted on the put-
ting of the question. The moderator was
unable to decide by a viva voce vote, and
a division being called for a rising vote
wes taken. When the result was an-
nounced the revisionists cheered heartily
and called for a vote on the adoption of
the majority report. On the advice of the
moderator, however. It was directed to
postpone consideration of this important
matter until Monday.

Mrs. Will Taylor has started a new
fashion In footwear. The dainty little lady-
Is using for street wear very low-cut
shoes with a big steel buckle clasped over
the Instep. I doubt if very many will
follow where Mrs. Taylor leads. To wear
a shoe such as she now is doing a pretty

We all have not such pretty feet, unfor

When the President was out driving his
attention was directed to Mrs. Martin's
magnificent residence.

that evening was Mrs. J. Neustadter. Her
gown was of most gorgeous black potnt

that has hailed the advent of Mr. Phil
lips. He Is welcome, surely welcome; but
let us not make ourselves ridiculous by
forgetting that his achievement as yet in
his own chosen line is but moderate when
compared with what -was accomplished
during the nineteenth century In France
o nd Germany.
â¢ â¢ â¢
By a dramatic poet 1 mean a man who
can write a poetical play that will act
successfully. Shelley could never do this,
nor Byron, though both attempted It;
Ecott and Keats, recognizing their limi
tations, never, I believe, did attempt It.
Tennyson's plays were all failures, with
the exception of "Becket," which enjoyed
a forced run, thanks to the immense ex
ertions of Sir Henry Ir\-lng. Swinburne's
dropsical tragedies ("Atalanta. In Caledbn"
being excepted) are mere watery moun
tains of words, and Browning, who really
had a dramatic Imagination; seemed to
care so little about the representation of
his works that he persistently refused to
mold them into those forms which expe
rience has shown a composition must take
If it in to be acted with success. So while
France has had Victor Hugo and Rlchepin
and Rostand, while Germany has -had
Schiller and Goethe and Hauptmann, Eng
land has had practically nobody and
America has hadâ George H. Boker. I
must confess that with even this distin
guished name on our side we haven't
scored very heavily. j'et In the matter of
dramatic poets: but give us time. We
ere young yet and are so busy getting
rich that we haven't had leisure to cast
even a glance at "the light that. never
was on land or *ea." But, by and by,
we'll cet out our telescopes and take a i
look at It; once we fasten our gaze on It I
"Herod" was produced by Mr. Beer
bohm Tree at Her Majesty's Theater on
the thirty-first of last October and ran
for eighty nights. The English critics
are slapping each other on the back
about this and congratulating their pub
lic on its high standard of intelligence.
Well, it certainly is gratifying to find
that there are 80,000 people in L,ondon
who can appreciate a poetic tragedy and
who will actually pay to see it But then
think of the 1,100,000 people that went to
Bee "Charley's Aunt" during its run of
over 1000 nights! That's about thirteen
times as many as went to see "Herod."
and this also furnishes food for thought
IT Is a little early. It â¢<*r > mn > to me, to
be classing Mr. Stephen Ph'llllps with
Sophocles and with Dante, as dons
Mr. Churton Collins in tho Saturday
Review; for so many men ,whoÂ»e
youth have given promise of the artÂ«
divine have accomplished so little after
the first flush of that youth has paled.
Indeetd, bo far as pure poetic imagination
1* concerned, Mr. Phillips' second play,
"Herod," shows a retrogression rather
than an advance from his first, "Paolo
Â«.nd Franceses." ; what Improvement there
may be is found In the department of
dramatic construction and this is not
always of the first order. I am perfectly
willing to believe that Mr. Phillips Is go-
Ing to be as proat a poet as Dante, whose
imagination was sicklied o'er with a pale
cast of thought that- the thinking world
has outgrown; but, from the dramatic
point of view, to compare. the author of
"Herod" to. the author of the "Oedipus
Rex" is like comparing Defoe as a de
scriptive writer to Carlyleâ small things
with great. Indeed!
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
The followins extract shows Mr. Phil
lips' style at its best. Herod Is replying,
to Salome's demand for Mariamno's
death:
Would you commit euch beauty to the earth 1
Thoae eyes that brine upon 'us endless thoughts!.
That face that ee?ms as it had coma to pass
Like a thin* prophesied! To kill her!
And I. if she were dead, I, too, would die,
Or linger in the sunlight without life;
Oh, terrible to live but' in remembering:!
To call her name down the long corridors;
To come on jewels that she wore, laid by;
Or open suddenly some chest and see
Borne favorite robe she wore on such a day!
I dare not bring: upon myself such woe.
The third act represents Herod as in
rane from grief and remorse. He thinks
Mariamne still lives; should he once real
ize that she is dead, his recovery, the phy
sician declares, is not to be hoped for. The
Interest is' skillfully suspended through
out this act by devices of his friends to
keep the King from insisting upon sight
of his wife.- When his demands can no
longer be resisted her embalmed body is
brought In; Herod touches her cold fore
head and "stands suddenly rigid, with a
fixed and vacant stare â¢ â¢ â¢ stricken
and in catalepsy bound."
Maddened by her rejection of his love
and persuaded by the slanders of Cypros
and Salome even to doubt her fidelity,
Herod In a frenzy orders the murder of
Mariamne. Hardly had this been accom
plished when he receives news that
Caosar Ijas greatly enlarged the dominion
of Judaea, making Herod practically mas
ter of the East and thus fulfilling his
hJphest ambitions. Forgetting his frenzied
"Kill her!" he calls for his Mariamne to
share his triumph. This gives an effective
climax to the second act.
MAKIAMNE-rBack, and In the Jungle burn
Whence you did leap out at my brother's
throat.
Can you deny your part tn thin? Oh, subtle!
Half rultor and half strangler, with one arm
About the sieter's neck, the other hand
About the brother's throat!
HKRODâ Martamne!
Mr. Phillips' plot Is simplicity itself.
Herod (called the Great), King of Judaea,
having raised himself to the throne, by
violence, marries Marfamne, a Princess of
the house of the Maccabees. His mother,
Cypros, nnd his sister Salome hate Marl
amne and her brother Aristobulus, who Is
rcporded by many of the people as the
rightful heir to the throne. Instigated by
Cypros and Salome, Herod causes Arlsto
bulus to be secretly murdered; Marlamne
discovers this jusÂ£ after the King has de
parted to give in his allegiance to Oc
tavius Caesar at Rhodes. Having: made
Cccpar his friend, Herod hastens back
with eager joy to Marlamne, only to find
that her love /or him is dead.
In the meantime we may be glad to get
our dramatic poetry from Mr. Stephen
Phillips and to acknowledge that "Herod,"
though not a masterpiece in the sense that
"Hamlet" and "Kaust" are masterpieces,
Is yet a fine play and well worth reading.
I wonder if It will ever get Itself acted in
San Francisco?
wÂ« shall become enthralled with tho love
lineM thereof. We shall analyze, dinned
and polarize that light; poet* that shall

It Is Captain Kessler now. Matrimony
What a bunch of pretty girls Mrs. Bry
an had helping: her receive at her tea.
Even Mary Barber's gracious presence did
not take one whit away, from that bevy
of fascinating misses and handsome ma
trons. And the lady In whose honor the
tea was given, Mrs. Rupert Blue, what a
beauty she is. Mrs. Blue Is going to stay
here until early In August; but the sum
mer season is not going to Interfere with
affaire to be given In. her honor. ]
I had a funny experience at Mrs. Bry
an's tea and I have been laughing over it
ever since. I was talking with Miss Stur
dlvant, a beauty . of the-' receiving party.
She was steering me through the crowd
toward the buffet, when she began her
apologies for our glorious and erratic cli
mate.
"It's too bad," she said, "the weather
we have been- having recently. It has
made me aulte sad."
â¢ â¢ , â¢
However, I did not look all the time at
Miss Barber's merry and expressive coun
tenance. I looked ,a few times at her
gown and_ thought how her own sweet
simplicity* was revealed In her dainty,
simple dress. It was of fine white taffeta
silk. The skirt just cleared the ground
and clung in graceful folds to her slender
figure. A deep shaped flounce gave It a
pretty j finish. The corsage was of the
same ' silk and laid ' in hemstitched tiny
tucks. A Jabot of soft white lace was the
only bit of relieving ornament. With the
gown Miss Barber wore a short-backed
white sailor hat trimmed with a full ruche
of white moussellne edged with the tiniest
band of black.
And I know Mary Barber meant every
word she said. I had only to look into her
tine dark eyes while she was speaking to
feel that.
"I am sorry to leave your city," she
said to me at the Bryan tea on Thursday.
"I like California. I love her people, and
I wish that things 'might have been dif
ferent, or. else that we might have re
mained here longer."
I HAVE lot my heart to winsome Mary
Barber and I know that thero are nny
number of other prirlu In the same sad
plight. With mo It was a cnsÂ« of love
nt first sight and I am told that tho
other victim* were afflicted in similar sud
den fashion. There Is something dellclous
ly fascinating about this petted llttlo
nlecoof the President. I do not know
whether It Is her delightful simplicity, her
sweet sincerity, her wlnfome ways or her
pretty face, that has catiRht the fnncy of
ench nnd every one of us; but this I do
knowâ takm altogether, she Is without
exception the most fetching little thing
that ever smiled In a drawing-room.
And she was as sorry to leave us as we
were to have her go.* Mary' Barber, alj
things permitting, would have liked to se<i
more of us. She would have liked to par
ticipate in ' the many functions we had
prepared In honor of her gentle aunt, the
sweet lady of the White House. She
would have liked to epetid every moment
of her short. stay In this city with the
charming people who live here and have
tasted to the full the many hospitalises
that we would have been so happy to offer
to her. . '

E RESIDENT McKINLEY'S attendance on Friday evening at a; rally of. the Epworth
League Alliance was in the'nature of a Jiappy coincidence; for it serves to recall attention
to the fact that the next big thing in San Francisco will be the assembling of the interna
tionalconvention of the; league. Â¦ The meeting is to -occur in July and there is none .too
much time for making preparation for it. Fortunately much has been already done, and the hos
pitality and liberality of the city can be counted on to make everything ready in due time' but none
the less. the subject should engage the , earnest attention of all public-spirited citizens from this
time on. . ;

is taken in r the convention. by members of the league in all parts of the country arid in different lo- :
calities meetings to arrange for excursions are being held daily.

EPWORTH LEAGlJE CONVENTION.
A DISPATCH from Grangeville, Idaho, says that on the.Camas prairie and Salmon River
hostilities between the sheep and cattle men have broken out'and great carnage is looked
for before the close of the season. Idaho is being eaten out by the forces that fight for
the free range on the public domain. Swift of Chicago has hundreds of thousands of
sheep in that State engaged in driving cattle off the public domain and then in the destruction of
the pastures on which they feed. ..',-'â¢'
FronrNew Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming come additional reports of the range
war. It is a situation as distressing as it is discreditable. The wealth of the public domain is being
destroyed, the country made more arid, the forests being endangered, and yet Americans .boast, of
their practical intelligence! They have it, but it is not on exhibition in dealing with these prob
lems in the arid region. . - '
The National Irrigation Congress, organized a dozen years ago, has toiled and worked and
resolved and implored and importuned, and at last has died, discouraged.. Its, meeting this year
was appointed for Colorado Springs, but is declared off because'the members are so; discouraged
that they refuse to attend. Of course that is the final end of the Irrigation,' Congress. The .lesson
to be drawn from its failure is that the public domain as Federal property must be'made t<? yield the
revenue required to timid the irrigation works needed.
That domain is now the scene of lawlessness and homicide. "Let it.be put under the reign of
law, and let those who are using it be compelled not only to maintain order, but be made-tq pay for
the pasture eaten by their herds and flocks. As we have shown, the Indian wards 'of the nation are
already the beneficiaries of this-policy. Their reservations are leased to the stockmen and the tribes
are getting a large revenue, while their range lands are growing better and feeding more stock
every year. It is strange if the white man is unable to do for himself that which he has done for the
Indian. , , : 'Â¦ ,. / * . \ Â¦ . '*Â¦Â¦-' .
THE RANGE WAR.
We must confess that: we are unable. to" connect on that statement. â¢ How an agreement be
tween existing ocean lines can prevent opposition lines is too much for us. If the statement were
that they had agreed not to increase the number of their ships, their tonnage, their facilities for han
dling the increase in commerce, it would he more intelligible, but no more likely to be the fact, since
that would be an agreement to refuse to carry a profitable increase in commerce, and would of
course invite other lines/or steamers, or seaports, to carry and control it.. .', We are .not aware of
the presence of an angelic and self-denying spirit. of that sort on this part of the coast. If it exist at
all, its bright and inspiring, presence must be known to Tacoma" alone. '
As far as the home port of ships is concerned San' Francisco has a documented fleet "of sev
eral hundred sail ships, and the part performed by the "wind-jammer" in the carrying trade is quite
important. Concerning' the monopoly of the Oriental trade enjoyed by Tacoma it is difficult to dis
cern. Our total imports/from Asia last year were- $139,842,330, our exports were $64,913,807.
making a total Asiatic trade for the whole United States of $204,756,137. Just how Tacoma mo
nopolized this with the total foreign trade of all the Sound ports amounting to $25,051,670 is
something we are unable to find in the figures.
Without at present segregating the foreign trade of San Francisco by countries, "it is' safe to
say that this port handled the bulk of the Asiatic trade that comes to the Pacific Coast.
All this is said not in complacency, nor in the idle assurance that any city can count for
cpmmercial supremacy upon its geographical position. Pre-eminence in trade comes out of pre
eminence in enterprise^ and as San Francisco has gamed what she has by the enterprise of the past,
she can hold and enlarge it only by equal or greater enterprise in rthe future.
The total tonnage entered and cleared at San Francisco jor 1900. was 1,7221330 and on Pu
get Sound 1,730,746. But, with about 8000 less tonnage entered and cleared, this port^ carried jiiid
handled $63,106,246 more foreign commerce than all the Sound ports combined.,
' During the first eight months of the present fiscal year, San Francisco hancjled $44,201,396 in
foreign commerce and the Sound; ports $17,297,009. Of course the foreign trade handled on the
Sound shows a large percentage of increase, for there was none at all â¢until railroad facilities were
created for handling it. The increase is gratifying to the whole coast, and the enterprise in those
ports is a proper spur to the energy of others. But the Times says that all Pacific Coast steamship
lines except Tacoma's have "entered into a combine whereby they agreed each with the other to
put on no more steamship; lines to run between Pacific Coast ports and China and Japan direct.
This agreement precludes any -extension of' opposition lines 'and permits Tacoma to maintain her
monopoly of the Oriental trade. 'Â¦â¢Â¦, 'Â¦Â¦Â¦.' â¢.'.:â¢Â¦ â¢ Â¦ i
rip HE Tacoma News, in an article setting forth the creditable position of that port in the.for-
I eign trade of the Pacific Coast, claims for that, seaport more steamer tonnage engagedin
I. that trade than. all other Pacific ports combined. .. All vessels have their home port, but
; f ;? the domicile of ships has but little to do with the 'commerce they carry, either in its
origin or' destination/ The cargo follows the course of commerce and is taken on and discharged 1
where the trade demands.
There are eight districts on this coast, San Francisco, Puget Sound, Willamette, Ore.; San
Diego, Los Angeles, Alaska, Humboldt and Oregon City. The total foreign imports and exports of
these ports for 1900 were $128,951,375. Of these San Francisco had. $88,237,916, or $23,757,229
more than half of the entire trade handled by the whole coast.

has officially announced to the powers of
the world that orders have been cabled to
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee con
templating his Immediate withdrawal from
China. This announcement Is set forth In
a circular note, a copy of which was de
livered to Acting Secretary of State Hill
to-day. It Is understood that Germany
invited suggestions from, the powers as to
the officers who should be placed In com
mand of the allied troops to remain in
China until their withdrawal. Instruc
tions have been cabled to United States
Embassador White on this subject. The
attitude of the United States is thus de
scribed: Â¦ Â¦ -
"The United States learns with satisfac
tion that Germany regards the time as
opportune for the withdrawal of Field
Marshal Count von Waldersee. It can
offer no suggestion, however, as to his
successor, as since the fall of Peking- the
United States has only maintained a lega
tion guard in the Chinese capital. It has
taken no part In punitive expeditions and
It does not believe that further military
operations are necessary. In line with
this belief orders were recently cabled to
Major General Chaffee, commanding 1 the
American troops, .to withdraw, leaving
only 160 men under command of an officer
of the rank of major as a legation guard
As the American Government has no force
In China outside of the legation guard it
can consequently take no part in the dis
cussion between the powers on the subject
of a successor to Field Marshal von Wal
dersee."
I/JNDON,- May 25.â It Is learned from
an official source in London that the ques*
tion of a successor to Count von Walder
, pee as commander In chief of the allies In
China during the Interim previous to com
plete withdrawal of the foreign troops is
now being 1 discussed by the powers. Von
Waldersee and the council of military
commanders at Peking have expressed
the opinion that the best way of settling
the question is for an officer of each na
tionality to have the supreme command in
turn. â¢
BERLIN, May 25.â At' the instance of
Count von Bulow, the Imperial Chancel
lor, Emperor William has ordered that the
German command in China be broken up
and that preparations be made to reduce
Germany's forces there.

CHICAGO, May 25.â One of the greatest
censpiracies to defraud insurance com
panies ever recorded was disclosed In the
Defenbach case to-day. Not $12,000, as the
indictment charges, but $67,000 was the
stake played for, according to the prose
cution. A ruling by Judge Tuley untied
the hands of the public prosecutors, and
the already celebrated trial now takes on
added interest and greater importance.
"The order of the court permitting
statements of Marie A. Defenbach.
charged with being a coconspirator, and
now dead, to be admitted in evidence
gives the State much desired leeway,"
said Assistant State Attorney Olsen.

MISCELLANEOUS.Several deals in southern oil lands are
reported. The Paris Oil Company has
Bold property producing about 1200 barrels
per month for S30.000. This Is in the north
western extension of the Los Angeles
field. The purchaser Is reported to be the
Los Angeles and Pacific -Railroad Com
pany. An Eastern syndicate is reported
by the Los Anseles Times to be dickering
with the Superior Oil Company for hold
lags on a basis of $200,000. On the prop
erty are two completed wells and one in
oil sand. The company has given an op
tion. The principal holdings of the OJai
Oil Company in Ojal Valley. Ventura
County, are also likely to be sold to a
Boston syndicate for $100,000, as reported
by the, Ventura Press. A syndicate of
Boston capitalists Is credited with having
taken an option on 1200 acres of the com
pany's 1547-acre tract for $100,000. The
syndicate has been incorporated with the
name of the Olga- Venturis. Oil Company.
Association to Meet.
Ventura was the first county in the State
to produce oil. The well, No. 6, drilled by
Thomas R. Bard in the "60's, is still yield
ing. Nearly 500 wells have been sunk In
the county and about 2iw are on the pump..
The annual meeting of the California
Petroleum Miners' Association will be
held in its office in the Mills building in
this city June 4. Directors will be elected
and committees will be appointed to pre
pare a new constitution and. by-laws.
An Interesting article appears in the
London Petroleum Review, which deals
with the proposition of Texas oil entering
England in competition with coal for fuel.
The Review says:
First, in regard. to geographical position the
Texas fields offer distinct advantages. They are
â¢wlthln easy reach of the 6ea, being only thir
teen miles from Port Arthur, which has direct
communication with the Gulf of Mexico. No
situation could be more favorable from a Eu
ropean point of view, and it will be England
and the continent which will be chiefly bene
fited. The other fields from which supplies of
liquid fuel can be drawn are Russia and Bor- ,
neo and, hitherto, the figure- at which it has :
been possible to deliver oil to this country has
been prohibitive bo far as its general applica
tion Is concerned. Freights alone have been
too high to permit of the fuel being-sold at a
commercial price. We are quite aVare that :
small Quantities have come in and are used :
to a limited extent, but the question here is j
the possibility of its general adoption in what
ever direction that is possible. Will the open-
Ing up of the Texas fields accomplish this?
Â¦\Ve are Informed â though we nave not yet been
favored with the actual figuresâ that this Texas
fuel oil can be landed in England at a much
lower figure than that from other sources.
In Eastern Fields.
The Oil, Paint and Drug Reporter gives
the total production of on in the pastern
fields of the United States for April as
follows:
The total oil production during the month
of April, as reported by the pipe lines, was
4.S12.421 barrels, of which 2,791,932 barrels was
of the Pennsylvanian grades and 1,520,189 bar
rels was of the Lima quality. The . total
ehowed a decrease of 77,654 barrels, and that
of Ohio oil an Increase of 32,119 barrels. The
deliveries during April amounted to 4,357,638
barrels, showing an Increase of 3272 barrels.
The deliveries were made up of 2,954,188 bar
rels Pennsylvania oil and 1,4U3,6:.O barrels Ohio
oil. The deliveries of the former showed an
Increase of 68,631 barrels and those of the lat
ter a decrease of 65,359 barrels. The total
nocks In possession of the pipe lines at the
close of April were 2S,615,981 barrels Pennsyl
vania -oil and 15,910,636 barrels Ohio oil. The
former showed a decrease Of 160.119 .barrels
and the latter aa increase of 301,774 barrels.
Confidence in the Future.
The best evidence that there is confi
dence In the future of the Retroleum in
dustry of California is given by the con
tinual additions to the list of incorpor
ated oil companies that propose to do
business In the State. Ten such are re
ported as having filed the necessary pa
pers within the last few days. It also will
be observed, that the fields that have been
demonstrated are being extended in sev
eral parts of the State. The Los Ange
lenos have completed their organization.
Wherever there is a legitimate oil pro
ducing company in the State confidence
Is expressed that the present low price
for oil will not continue. The oil boom
in Texas will not permanently interfere
with California, according to the views of
the most conservative oil men. The wild
prices indicate how little chance the small
investor has to engage in oil enterprises
In Texas. Land is held, so it is reported,
at from $25,000 to $100,000 per acre In the
Beaumont field.
Refineries Are Extending. .
The new stills of the Sunset Oil Refin
ing Company at Los Angeles will be in
operation within sixty days. The present
capacity of the plant Is 25,000 barrels.
"With" the new stills the capacity will' be
enlarged to 50,000 barrels per month, which
is about one-half of the total monthly
production Â¦ of Los Angeles- Having this
In view, the claim is made that the mar
keting problem in Los Angeles Is near so
lution. The American Refining: Company's
plant at Los Angeles is also expected to
resume work. There are four other refin
eries operating that help to take care of
the flos Angeles output. The Herald says
that it is plain that if these refineries
should be ail put in operation at full ca
pacity within the next sixty days, as now
ftems probable, there will be a demand
tor oil that will surpass the product of
the local field. There is a movement at
Los Angeles toward the refineries because
-their product is meeting with ready sale
at good prices. Â¦ The Sunset refinery. In
addition to turning out distillates and as
phaltum. Is manufacturing illuminating
and lubricating; oils.

A plat- of the National Guard encamp
ment grounds on Laveaga' Heights, Santa
Cruz, has been prepared and furnished to
the division commander. Upon it are
marked the locations for the various or
ganizations that are to be-in camp. The
hospital corps is on the extreme north
western end of the camp; east of, and in
front, are the division headquarters, adju
tant general's headquarters and the en
gineer officers' quarters. ' The Sixth In
fantry is east of these headquarters; then
in rotation are the Second Infantry, Fifth
Infantry, the First Infantry and the Sev
enth Infantry, the latter on the extreme t
northwestern end of the grounds. The I
battalion of artillery is located just south
of the First Infantry, the â¢ signal corps
just below the Second Infantry, and the
cavalry squadron and the horses south
west of the signal corps. The Third Bri
gade headquarters are at the head of the [
Second | Infantry, the Second Brigade j
headquarters at the head of the. Fifth In
fantry, 1 and those of the First Brigade at
the head of the Seventh Infantry. The
plat shows how the regimental, company |
and detachment streets have been laid |
out, and also ' the locations of the mess
tents and other buildings requisite for a
first-class camp. The parade and drill
ground Is on a plateau opposite. the loca
tion of the Second and Firth infantry.
In General Orders No. 4, issued yester
day, all the troops heretofore ordered to
Camp Gage are direcced to report to
Colonel D. E. Miles, assistant adjutant
general of the division, not later than 3
o'clock on June 15. The camp will be
formally opened at 4 o'clock by the rais
ing of the colors and the firing of a na
tional salute. .'_....
'Squadron of Cavalry.
The four troops of cavalry will be organ
ized into a squadron under command of
the ranking cavalry officer present.
The signal officers and signal corps of
the three brigades will be consolidated
and commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J.
C. Evans, chief signal officer of the di
vision. Â¦ â¢ i
The sanitary corps^as detailed to the
respective regiments will be consolidated
under command of Colonel W. D. Mc-
Carthy, and a - general hospital will be pro
vided.
Transportation will be furnished upon
request by Colonel F. J. H. Rickon, di
vision quartermaster. Transportation will
be allowed only to those who reach camp
not\ater than Sunday evening, June 16.
The families of officers and men desiring
to visit the camp can obtain transporta
tion for the regular full fare one way and
one-third added from place of residence to
Santa Cruz and return.
The orders say further: T
The performance of jn:ard duty is a test of |
the discipline and intelligence of a command,
and a strict .performance thereof will be re
quired at this camp. To this end no unneces
sary guards will be required, but there will
be a grand guard made up of details from the
different commands with a lieutenant colonel
as field officer of the day, which guard will be
the "exterior guard" of the camp. The com
manding officer of each brigade, squadron and
detachment will maintain a suitable guard
around the quarters of his command, provided
that there shall always be at least one sentry
in each street dividing commands, one from
the other; one sentry at each guard tent, and
one sentry at or near each of the kitchens.
Such, guards will be known ..as "interior j
guards," and their entire duty will consist in
looking after the prooerty and the good order
of the camp. Should occasion require the use
of a patrol or provost guard the grand guard
Trill furnish it. The attention of this command
is called particularly to the proposition that
a guard is not primarily for the purpose of pre
venting any infractions end disregard of orders
among themselves; for we are all supposed to
understand and obey these orders: but the
guard 1b for the purpose of protecting our
property, and It is a necessary part of the dis
cipline and drill incidaat to camp life which
fits us for duty Iryfiie field when a guard is
necessary to protect our lives as well as our
property frcm our enemies. .Â¦
How, the Men Will Dress.
The fatigue uniform of blue will be worn j
during the encampment on all occasions of |
ceremony with the fatigue cap and not the
campaign' hat, and on other than occasions of
ceremony khaki uniforms and the campaign
hat may be worn at the option of brigade com
manders.
During the encampment tents must not be
marked or written upon or injured in any man
rer and nails must not be driven in tent poles, j
and great care must be taken of all property
in the camp to save it from, injury or loss. Â¦
-The dally routine will be announced in due
time, and the object of the general command
ing will be to consolidate the hours for work,
and also the hours for "off duty,'. 1 and e\ - ery
officer and man In the division Is expected to
work equally hard during both hours. We all
take a pride and an interest In our military
proficiency,* and that pride Is only to be kept
alive and that interest maintained by a strict
and intelligent observance and performance of
duty. Let every officer and man understand
and fee! that the good name and reputation of
the division and the various commands com
posing it Is in his keeping, and conduct himself
accordingly. A strict attention to our military
duties, when required, will give a wholesome
flavor and relish to our hours of play, while
a slipshod performance of duty is not only to
our discredit, but destroys the pleasure of our
camp life and subjects, us to the. .ridicule of
the public. All are therefore requested to do
even more than they have In the past to make
this camp a successful one.
. Ball cartridges will not be used during the
encampment except by those companies desir
ing to make their recor-J in skirmish firing; and
each company Is requested to furnish sixty
rounds of blank cartridges per man for use
during thÂ« drill exercises and field maneuvers,
as there Is no money available to furnish this
ammunition, -tj >
During the encampment there will be no
troop or company . drill*, but short setting-up
exercises each morning after reveille, which
will be at 6:80 or 6 a. m. After breakfast sick
call and police, duty, then field maneuvers,
brigade battalion and regimental drills will
constitute the military exercises aside from, the
usual guard mountings and dress parades. So
far as at present advised, there will be but
one review, and that will be on the day the
Governor officially visits the camp. .--

A CorneU glrl.vruM p<rit on a Grape-Nuts
' diet and discovered some facts. She Â¦ays:
"While a student at Cornell I suffered
from Improper diet ' The banquets and
other social functions â with their rich re-
freshmentsâserved to completely upset a
6tomach already weak from rich pastry,
highly seasoned meats, and confections
furnished by loving parents at home.
"1 became Irritable, nervous and my ap-
petite became more and more capricious.
Only rich, highly , seasoned food suited
me. and this further wrecked my health.
I was sallow, having loet my pink and
white complexion. I became dull eyed
and dull brained, the victim of agtxrjlzlng
dyspepsia and Intestinal trouble.
"I was finally forced to leave school and
came home an irritable, wretchedly tick
girl. The plainest food disagreed with
me, and I bade fair to starve to death,
when a physician < advised my physician
to put me on Grape-Nuts Pood diet To
make a long story short, the transforma-
tion from wretched Ill-health to gx>od
health was marvelous. I liked the new
food so well, and it agTeev* with my tor-
tured stomach perfectly, regulated my
bowels, my headaches left, and the color
of the skin eradually prew better. In
eight; months I found myself roey, plump
- and strong.
Â¦"I would not sell my clear complexion,
bright eyes and general good feeling for
the costliest, rlcheat mess of Delmonlcan
pottage. . ."
"I. returned to Cornell,, finished my
course, and can now study, think and
live. . The food that enabled me to regain
my health' I shall . never J forsre*." ' Name

Want the Advance Freight.
A novel marine case is shortly to. be
tested In the courts. A couple of years
ago the Nome Beach Lighterage ana
Transportation Company was formed in
this city. It purchased the barken tine
Catherine Sudden and advertised her -to
sail for Nome with merchandise. A con
siderable sum was collected in freight
money, but the cargo was never deliv
ered, as the vessel got caught in the ice
and was nipped. The Frankfort Marine
Insurance Company had a number of
risks on vessel and cargo and It considers
that the Nome Beach Lighterage and
Transportation Company has no claim on
the. freight money paid in advance, as the
goods were never delivered. It will ac
cordingly try to recover about $2600 from
the corporation.
The Overdue Fleet.
The following were Lloyd's quotations
on the overdue fleet on the 15th inst. :
British bark Manchester, 275 days out from

SYMPTOMS OF BAD BLOOD J|J V Â§gt
There is a popular *belief that every boil is worth r^^^fe.
many times its weight in gold, and the sufferer WW lj||ll
patiently, even cheerfully, endures the pain under the W Â»n^
mistaken idea that these little tormentors are health j <^s^
promoters; that they thin the; blood when too thick, \\ ><^Â§liii^Â§Â§Â§S^
and cleanse and cool it when too hot or too rich. On 2^k^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\
the contrary, boils and carbuncles are evidence of blood | "^11111111*
poverty, or a fearfully depraved condition of that fluid. \ wC^J^L^
There may be no external evidence of bad blood until ?^^y^ at //// ' >f\^^
the warm days of spring set in motion the sluggish \^Jr m z^ Â£ -Â» > f*
circulation and the pent-up impurities, unable to escape J^ /ft
through the natural outlets, gather near the surface of . * . ,
the skin, and a Carbuncle or a Boil is the result \ When the blood is burdened with an
undue amount of this impure matter, the Boils come in greater number, eat deeper into the
surrounding flesh, and, being; nearly always located on a bed of nerves, cause the most
intense suffering. Robust and apparently healthy people are subject to Boils,. and there is
always some hidden agency at work witnin the blood arid system that will eventually
undermine the health, but those whose constitutions are broken down by previous sickness
or other causes, are most often tne unhappy victims of Boils and Carbuncles. Exposure to
the deadly malaria destroys the red corpuscles and reduces the blood to such a weak and
watery condition that it succumbs to the boil-producing poisons, an<J the pale and sallow
dangerous carbuncles, sufferer is continually iiurs- ; banefui. boiw.

into a running abscess or ugly eating sore, causing years of suffering, and often terminating
fatally. To seek relief from the inflammation and pain produced by these terrifying erup-
tions through the application of local remedies is natural and right, but # this method of
treatment does not prevent others coming, or bring the slightest relief to the disease-burdened,
deeply poisoned blood. Only a thorough regeneration and building up of the depreciated
blood can bring about a lasting cure of Carbuncles and Boils and prevent their reappearance.

Undoubtedly the Drettiest contest of the
afternoon was furnished at' the close of
the six furlong handicap," with a field' of
six accepting the weights. Sent away on
even terms, Hoar on Mike Strauss started
to set the pace, but early became attacked
with a hemorrhage, falling to the rear.
"Chub" Russell astride the 5 to 1 shot
Doublet then took up the running, and
in a rub with The Miller, a 97-pounder,
and St. Cuthbert, one of the top weights,
got the verdict by a scant half length In
1 :13V4. Meehanus, the I favorite, with . 117
pounds up, found the Impost too much of
an incumbrance. Â¦ . â¢ Â¦
An uncertain bunch of platers in the
opening sprint caused an aggravating de
lay at tho post before a start could be
accomplished. Companion quit f after
showing a fair turn of speed, and at the
wire Ruiz landed Catherine Â¦ Bravo, the
second choice, In 'front, less than, .a
length before Rasp. â¢ â¢
Glendenning, the fast two-year-old from'
the Atkin & Lottridge stable, seems to
have gone back. The youngster ruled ' a

After his showing In the mile and a'
half selling affair it was quite 'evident
Stromo Is no weight packer. Shouldering

stated* that ; knocking .about the

ways believed In the revelations of Gypsy

."It must have been about that hour. that
we heard the only noise that could be
connected with the terrible affair upstairs.
It. sounded to us as if the people there
were closing, tho doors in the house, pre
paratory to retiring for the night. We
paid no attention to it, and knew nothing
of the murder until aroused by the cries
of Mrs.' HlBlopi" ,

until 10 o'clock.

different â¢ wounds.
"My God, Robbie; can't you speak?"
pitifully asked the grief-Btrlcken parent,
catsting aside the bloody coverlet. on his
son's body.
\ With a faint grasp the boy,, died, and
with a piercing scream Mr. Hislop ran
from the house, to inform his wife of
what had happened.
The wall of the room was bespattered
with blood, showing that the unfortunate
boy made at least a faint struggle to es
cape from his assasuln. -Â¦Â¦ ' '
Aroused by the cries of the grief
stricken parents, several of the neighbors
ran into the house, and, upon learning
of the crime, at once telephoned to the
police.
Detectives Ed Gibson and Rlordan were
soon on the scene and they immediately
pet to work to find some clew which would
lead to the capture of the murderers.
As the doors were found locked, tho
suppoKltion i* that the burglars climbed
through the half-open window of the
room occupied by their unfortunate vic
tim and started to ransack the 1 house.
Young Hislop was awakened by them, it
is thought, and as he made an outcry
they crushed his skull, presumably with
a hammer.
\ George E. Hislop, the brother of tha
murdered boy, was heart-broken and
could scarcely speak, He boro up bravely,
however, and assisted Captain Seymour

Thirteen- Year-Old Robert Hislop Found by Parents Upon Their Return From
Town With His Skull Crushed, Probably by a Hammer.
One of the most terrible crimes com- 1
mltted in this city for many years was
perpetrated last night, when Robert His
lop, aged 13, was foully murdered by burg
lars at his father's residence, 104% Haight
Ftreet. As he lay In bed the housebreak
ers, presumably fearing that be was about
to raise an outcry, repeatedly Btruck him
Â¦with some blunt instrument, crushing the
*kull in several places. After satisfying
that he was beyond all human
aid the desperate pair thoroughly ran
eacked the house, securing little of value.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last evening Mrs.
Hislop, following her usual custom, went
to meet her husband, who conducts a car
pet and furniture store at 341 Hayea street.
Ehe asked her son to accompany her, but
as be was tired he refused her request,
but promised to "keep house" until Â»he
returned. Before leaving the residence
Mrs. Hislop extinguished all the lights,
with the exception of the one Jn her Â»on's
room, which Is In tho front part of the
house. Â¦ .
Mre. HiBlop assleted her husband In
cloBlnff his place of business, after which
they walked up HaJght street to their
home. As they reached the house Mrs.
Hislop was surprised to see a light in the
frpnt and back parlors. As she had ex
tinguished thÂ« Ilghtu Jn those rooms be
fore leaving her none she became sus
pJeJou* and so told tier husband.
"I know there aro burglars In tho
house," *hÂ« nervously said to her hui
Â»Â»and. "I urn nure lhat I extinguished the
lights before I left."
Without waiting to question his wifo

cuts that, gave evidence of '.the conflict.
One knife thrust ho,d,gbne through, the
outer coat and had ripped into "the. vest.
Â¦A second cut was in the breast and a
third was on the right sleeve, where the
knife blade, slashed when Austin had
thrown, up his arm to ward off a thrust.
The, encounter, according to Austin,
there being no other witnesses, was the
result.of Burnham's.threat to kill his em
ployer-because' Austin had reprimanded
him for threatening actions toward Mrs.
Austin and the housekeeper, Mrs. Har
desty, during ills absence.

perate" encounter; as he related It at ( the
County, Jail follows: ; :

free myself, and he followed me up across
the stable, 'thirty or forty feet, 'and out
into the yard; I struggled and warded off
the < knife ' thrusts, -but- 1'> saw it was my
life 'or his, so I got out my pistol and
commenced to tire at. him so closely that
hie clothes 'caught ! tire., I. shot at him
every tlmo he lunged at me with the
knife, but he did not Â«top until I put the
pistol at his neck, ana when he let go
after I fired that shot ho coolly closed the
Unite, put it Into his pocket and Dank to
the ground near the porch eteps.

htm he\couldn't do that. Then he be
came ugly and pulled out his knife.

larger than Auntln.
The records of the Alameda County Jail
throw more light upon Burnham's career,
and this episode is not the first one In
which he played a part as a knife wielder.
On October 12, 1899, he was sentenced to
a year's Imprisonment In the County Jail
for stabbing Gustave Neteon, an Iron
worker.- at Emeryville. Burnham had
been drinking: and made an unprovoked
attack on Nelson in a saloon after abuslns
and threatening the woman who conduct
ed the place. Some time before that Burn
ham clubbed an old man into insensibility
during a roWovcr a calf in Redwood Can
yon.
Burnham was 52, years of age and a na
tive of Massachusetts.
' "I do not know much about the man,
except that he has a slater in the East,"
said Austin. "He told, me that he once
stabbed a nULn." 'Ut^sTPwt
Burnham had been employed last fall
by Austin and left, returning a couple of
months ago.
Austin sent at once for hiÂ» attorney.
George "VV. Reed, and pending his arrival
from San Francisco Attorney George
Jackson took charge of his case. Austin
stands well at Kast Oakland, having an
extensive business and bearing an excel
lent reputation as a law abiding citizen.
His offices have been at 1101 Twenty-third
avenue for many years. Ne*s of tho
shooting spread so rapidly that before he
reached the County Jail many of his
friends were making efforts for his re
lease. .

/^J/ . Oakland, shot ' and.'.kllled John H.
Burnham, -his man of all work, at
2:30 o'clock' this afternoon at the Austin
residence, 12G1 High street. -rBurnham,
drunk and ugly, had attacked Austin with
a. pocket knife.; 7 The men grappled and
struggled across a barn floor out into the
yard; the' hlrtd man slashing'Iwlth his
weapon â¢ and Â¦ ripping Austin's coat ' in sev
eral places. â¢/ Â¦.:' v ', .'
ij Austin drew his pistol and with each
blow from the knife, 'flred at Burnham as
they fought hand to hand for their. lives.
Three shots failed to stop the Infuriated
Burnham. Austin was backed down to
the rear Dorch. of the residence, when he
managed to get his pistol at " Burnham' s
neck, and. as, the knife of the latter again
slashed through his coat sleeve he pressed
the. trigger and sent a bullet through his
assailant's neck. The bullet cut the main
artery and as the blood spurted from the
wound Burnham staggered back, closed
his knife, put it in .'his pocket and sank
to the ground., dying in a few minutes. â¢
.'Austin stopped to compose his wife and
their' housekeeper,,' and then went to
Charles Harrison's place at High street,
on. the San Leandro road, where he tele
phoned to the Sheriff that he "desired to
surrender. ' â¢ ' â¢ â¢
Surrenders to Deputy Sheriff.
Before response was made from | down
town Austin found Deputy Sheriff Ed
mund Gates at High street, to whom he
surrendered and turned over his_ pistol.
Harrison notified the Coroner, at Aus
tin's request and Burnham's remains were
removed to the Morgue.' The bullet
wounds In the body were fourâ one In the
neck, two. on the right side of the chest
and another in the left shoulder. - ..
Austin was taken to the County Jail by,
Deputy Sheriff George Taylor. The pris
oner was calm and â¢ deliberate, but ex-,
pressed regret at being compelled to kill a
human beiifg. He was covered with dirt
and wife, claimants for a share in the
estate of the late Dr. Martin of Oakland.
Nagle represented the heirs, and one. of
his duties was to Bee that Mrs. Burke
was paid for sheltering his clients. This,
Mrs. Burke claims, he neglected to do,
despite numerous appeals, and she then
determined to take the law into her own
hands. .
The amount alleged to be due Mrs.
Burke is only $32, and she thinks she still
has quite a sum coming after, allowing
credit for the horsewhipping, and says
she will collect the balance in the same
5 manner, so the prospects for the future
look rather dark for Mr. Nagle.
Mrs. Burke was' seen at her house on
Howard street last night' and was aching
for another chance at the attorney. She
said, in a voice trembling with rage: '
"Mr. Nagle owes 'me that $32 and I am
going to have it out of him. As lawyer
for Martin he paid me $3G, honoring my
lodger's orders for that amount. He said
some time ago when I made "a claim for
the $32 now due that $9 30 was all that
was coming to me, but offered me $20 to
call It even. 1 refused and placed the
case In the hands of a collector. The lat

and that I haa better' take the. $20. I
would not take anything less than $32, and

side yesterday. The day was a
poor one for trap shooting and little en

There were very few spectators present,
but it is believed that there will be a
pood attendance to-day if the weather is
favorable. Â¦ Â¦
E. Lm. Forster won the first event, which
â¢was the Cinch Bros.' trophy. He broke
20 blue rocks out of a possible 20, and
took the handsome prize. The E. T. Allen
trophy was won by A. M. Barker. He
broke 13 blue rocks, but was tied by E.
L,. Forster. E. Schmetz, H. Justins and.M.
Burnell. The five shot off and Barker
was high g^m. P. B. Bekeart captured
the Association trophy by killing 20 in a
20-bird race. The Golcher trophy went to
A, Fleckenser. The latter made 19 and
was tied by F. W. King, W. J. O'Neill
and "U. M. C." In the shoot-off he made
the hiffh score and captured the prize.

"These 'homeseekers' excursions' should
be a great thing for California. Every
body knows what a big success the colo
nist rate was, and I think that this busi
ness will far exceed it. Clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, in fact, all kinds of peo
ple will take advantage of this rate and
visit California. Instead of going to Niag
ara Falls or the Pan-American Exposi
tion they will buy a ticket and come out
and see what California ia like. We will
advertise the rates all over the United
States, and this is certainly one of the big
gest undertakings in cheap transportation
the Southern Pacific has ever attempted.
The trunk lines, or more properly, the
railroads that run from New York to
Chicago will also co-operate, and they will
sell tickets from New York to Chicago
&x. the same rate, one-half fare."
General Passenger Traffic Manager E.
O. McCorxnlck, in speaking of the matter
yesterday, said:
These "homeseekers' excursions" will be
of great value to California in many ways.
Eastern men will have a chance to. visit
this State at a low figure; they can look
into the oil, fruit and farming Industries
and then decide whether they wish to re
main here. The recent colonist rate in
djced 20,000 persons -to visit this State, and
indications are that the new rate, which
goes into effect on June 4. will prove even
a greater inducement than the colonist
rate.
The fare from Chicago to any California
point will be $64 50 for a first class round
trip ticket, from St. Louis and New-Or
leans $59 50 and $62 from Kansas City.
Theee tickets are good for twenty-one
days after date of sale, and stop-over
privileges are allowed along the entire
line of the Southern Pacific Company's
system traveling westward in California,
but no Btop-over will be- allowed on the
return trips. â¢ - . - - Â¦_ . â¢
AW arrangements were completed yes
terday to run a number cf excursions
from Chicago to California during the
summer months. The trains will leave
the Windy City on the first and third Tues
days of June, July, August and Septem
ber, and will be known as "The Home
seekers' Excursions."
The Southern Pacific Company will in
augurate a scheme to induce clerks and
per&ons of moderate means to spend their
summer vacations in California this year.

The Placervllle Nugget reports that at
the Mount Hope Mine on the east belt
a road is being graded that ore may be
hauled to the mill. Four thousand feet
of pipe has been recently laid to conduct
air from the compressor on the river to
the shaft. A hoist, two drills and a
pump are operated by air. The drills
now in use are giving satisfaction. Work
is being prosecuted at the 200-foot â¢ level.
The Mount Hope ledge lies between the
mountain granite and the Mariposa slate.
On the proposed route of the Salt Lake
road, in Death Valley, on the Funeral
Mountains, Robert Montgomery of Los
Angeles has located gold and copper
properties that will later be developed.
Several years ago Mr. Montgomery, who
is a well-known operator, found these
properties, but as railroad transportation'
was an unknown problem, they were not
located. With the promise of transporta
tion, Mr. Montgomery readily found the
ledges that for years had been forgotten.
Clifford Fleming is associated with Mont
gomery in these and other properties in
the desert section. While the ore on the
Funeral Mountains is not high grade, the
ledges are reported to be wide.

Butte County Diamonds.
The Oroville Mercury says:
Butte County diamonds are again attracting
attention. For some time a man named Thomp
son has been at Cherokee searching for precious
gems. Lately he has shifted the scene of his
operations to Big Bend, where he believes he
has found unmistakable evidences of diamond
deposits which, if his view is correct, occupy
a strip extending diagonally across country and
including Cherokee, where gems have been dis
covered occasionally for several years. Another
alleged diamond expert has been at Cherokee
for several days and is "reported to have been
buying such stones as were for sale, probably
for speculative purposes.. : â¢ .
The Amador Dispatch says the Amador-
Phoenix Gold Mining Company is the'
name of an incorporation that has taken
possession of the Particelli-Spagnoli mine
near Irlshtown, which will proceed to at

are R. C. Rust, president; John Ross Jr.
vice president; S. G. Spagnoli, treasurer;
L. J. Fontenrose, secretary; A. M. Gall
James E. Dye and W J. Nettle. The com
pany has a six-stamp mill, which will be
put up at once, as there is ore enough on
the dump and in sight to keep such a mill
running five or six months.
Â¦ In both placer and quartz . workings opera
tions are being pushed with vigor in Siskiyou
County. ThR spell of. warm weather, causing
the snow to melt quickly, has furnished ail
abundance of water for all purposes and pros
pecting is being done on a large scale, the

Klamath will In all probability disclose some
new and valuable deposits as a result of the
present covering of that promising mineral
field. Â¦ Hyoranlic work on the Salmon River
soes on night and day, full advantage being
taken of the supply of water. There are no
idle men in the Salmon sectiun, and never be
fore In die history of Siskiyou County has
there been such a demand for labor of all
kinds as at present. The opening of so many
new mines in the western and northern part
of the county has caused a demand for many
miners and every one Wio comes along receives
employment readily, while the* large number of
mill plants in the southern part take the sur

feel confident that good pay will be real

The Mother Lode Bulletin reports that
the Mapes mining property in Tuolumne
County has been bounded to' W. E. Coal.
The stamps at the Hope mine have been

This is due in part to the unusually large
output of gold the preceding year, which
was greater than any year for the past

be less than that of last, for the reason
that better and more perfect preparation
was made for work than heretofore.

The first point of attack is copper.' Mr.'
Aubury says that in the State Mineralo

CHICAGO, -llay 25.â At the suggestion
of President â¢ Samuel s Gompers of the
American Federation of Labor a move
ment was started to-day to cement all
labor organizations of Chicago into one
great' central, body, which shall officially
represent the 100,000 union men of the city.
This is to be done through the absorption
by the Chicago Federation of Labor of the

gathering of unions not' now affiliated

REALTY FUTURE
PROMISES WELL
Nature of Improvements
Puts Rosy Tinge on
Outlook.
Transactions Recorded Are
Summed Up in Large
Figures!
Prosperous conditions affecting realty
values favorably are observable, at all
leading points in the Pacific Coast States,
but in no 'State is the forward movement
as strongly marked as In California. Tak
ing the class of improvements projected
and under way as a basis for estimating
the faith of the people in a continuance
of the advance, if will be observed that
this is true. - Â¦
The $1,250,000 hotel for the Crocker es
tate, the great Hay ward building, now
well forward - in construction; the Flood
building, to go up on the old site of the
Baldwin theater; the fine building for the
Callaghan estate at the -ore of Market
and McAllister streets â these alone show
the growth of confidence In San Francisco
concerning certain classes of buildings. To
these must be added the eight or ten story
building which the action of the San
Francisco Merchants' Exchange assures
for California street. These are office
buildings mainly, with the exception of
the Crocker hotel, but there are several
fine buildings in the wholesale section of
the city which indicate present confidence
In the future of the commerce and indus
tries of San Francisco. . Large structures
have been erected to give room to the ex
panding business . of commercial houses.
The building for Miller, Sloss & Scott is
a striking , example of such structures.
Claus Spreckels ' will ; erect a five-story
building on Bush street for the Nathan-
Dohrmann Company, whichVwlll connect
with the present quarters of the company
on Sutter street by. arches. . .

There. will be' an. Interesting time at the
City Hall this week for the Supervisors.
The San Francisco school teachers have
determined to try to get In full, with.In
terest, the money.due them for their eer
vices. Colonel Charles , H. Murphy has
sent out notification to every school In
the city to be represented when the teach
ers ask the Board of Supervisors to give
them a hearing. .
This means that about 100 teachers, the
majority being ladles, will urge upon the
Supervisors ihat they are entitled to prin
cipal and inrerest. They are arguing that
they made the fight throughout the State
to have the constitutional amendment
passed that was designed as a measure
for their relief. They say that they Intend
to pursue this matter until they get what
is honestly due them, and that they will
take it into politics if necessary, where It
may figure largely. - . *Â£
\ This week the Supervisors will be asked
merely to fix a' date for the hearing. It
will be urged that the approval "of the
constitutional amendment by the voters of
this city by 88 per cent of the total poll
indicated unmistakably that the public
desired that the teachers ought to have
their dues In full. In round figures the
back Salaries due amount to $118,000 and
the Interest to about $27,000. ,

Their Claims.

in the organization and management of the
Montezuma Mining Company of Waahlng-
ton the directors are dominated by a single-
ness of purposeâ to succeedâ to make theirs
one of the big, strong, profit-sharing mining
concerns of thle country of tremendous pos-
sibilities. Thus far tMey have met with the
greatest measure of success possible in so
short a time. The subauing of a wilderness,
which is what the Montezuma has under-
taken, Is no mean task. The expenditure
of both time and money Is necssary. Of the
former, but a few months have been given
to the work, but with the kindly assistance
of Nature much has been accomplished; of
money, there has been sufficient for current
needs, thanks to the shareholders who in
the beginning took the . Company on faith,
but who arc rewarded in the possession of
stock at small cost
MORE MONEY NEEDED.
But more time and more money will be
needed to bring the copper mines to a self-
sustaining basis. The money is coming-in
constantly Increasing amount, and while the
monthly payroll grows larger, not a cent
is- being expended injudiciously. Every dollar
is applied under wise and efficient manage-
ment. The "Tacoma" tunnel has been driven
160 feet through the ore body, and work
will be hastened soon by the Introduction of
an air drill. The coal mines are being de-
veloped rapidly, forty men being engaged
therein, and the water wheel and sawmill
will have been Installed before our excursion
party of shareholders and others reach the
mines. Both coal and coke will be pro-
duced in considerable quantities during the
summer and fall.
NOT A RICH MAN'S MINE.
The title to the Montezuma le not vested
in a few wealthy men. It was the good
fortune of a small body of poor men to, get
together these properties; and having secured
them, they, In a quiet way, did enough de-
velopment work to prove their worth. This
being done, they were offered ample funds
for developmentâ by capitalists who wanted
a controlling interest But the men who had
staked so much of their own resources on
"the Montezuma mines preferred to carry out
the original plan of making the Company
strictly . co-operative, and have rigidly ad-
hered to that Idea. Holders of the stock will
share and chare alike, and the smallest has
a voice in the management. Some of the
best mines in the world were so brought to
a self-sustaining basis, and are to-day pay-
ing handsome dividends to the fortunate
holders of the stock. But while the Monte-
zuma is not a "rich man's mine," it will
create rich men and give to others a com-
fortable income.
FAVORED BY FORTUNE.
If ever a mining company waa situated
favorably to keep operating expenses at the
lowest possible limit when the time comes
for production, that Is the Montezuma. It
will mine its own coal, make Its own coke,
and burn that coke in a smelter which it
and another company will build. Numerous
big veins of coal in the 2000 acres compris-
ing the lease make a coke 90.46 per cent
carbon, and a ready market awaits such
surplus as may be beyond the Company's
needs. This means no smelting charges, no
profit on coke, no profit on coal, but in-
stead the desirable commodities, coke and
blacksmlthing coal to sell.
SATISFIED INVESTORS.
A significant fact in connection with the
sale of Montezuma stock ia the complete eat-
lsfactlon It gives the people who buy It.
Of the hundreds of Â¦mall holders, not one
is dissatisfied, but on the contrary, every
one is firm In the belief that his money is
well spent. The Montezuma Company offers
no "ret-rlch-qulck" Inducements to prospec-
tive shareholders; It stives every man *a
chance to buy to the extent of his ability or
desire in a legitimate, well-managed min-
ing company that has behind It some ex-
tremely rich properties, iillwit they are for
the greater part In the rough.
OPPOSED TO DEHT.
Wnllo the Montezuma Company must and
will have money to continue the development
of their properties, they would cease work
rather than Imrrow on a mortgage. "No
debts, no morlfc-agta," la an established prin-
ciple with the Company, Jietter a tempo-
rary Idle property than one plastered with
a mortgage. Hut work will go on, and mora
vigorously this summer than before. They
who read and study tha Montezuma pros-
pectus hav* full confidence In the Company,
and back ihat confidence with their money,
Their reward will surely coma,

LOCAL MARKETS.
This week's stock market has shown a dis
position to slip into dullness and increasing
difficulty has been met in attracting any out
side business. It has been the smallest week's
business of the year and has been more and
more restricted to the hands of professional
operators. There has been some notable de
mand at times for certain stocks, such as the
Eries. the Southwestern* and the coalers, both
anthracite and bituminous. The street Is not
agreed in its opinion of the motives of this
buying. One party sees Jn it a renewal of
operations by the great railroad proprietors
in the further development of "community of
Interest" plans, in the newer phases of those
plans involving control of connecting systems
rather than of lateral competitors euch , as
marked the earlier period. Others Bee In lt
merely speculative operations by pools, with a
design to reawaken public interest in
speculation or to' afford a market
forcing ' out pool holdings which were
held through the panic or were picked
up at the low price touched since. The pro
fessional character of the market had been
Indicated by the narrow range of price move
ments and their constant fluctuations, the
course of prices never continuing | beyond . the
second day. From time to time there has
been positive pressure to sell, induced by sev
eral disturbing factors. The principal of these
Is the Northern Pacific dispute, which con
tinues to loom' big In the estimation of dam
aged speculator* and to ca*t . a shadow on
the market Assurances that the disputed
points have been adjusted to the mutual sat
isfaction of the great railroad interests con
cerned have had th<?lr soothing effect marred
by indications to the contraT. For one thing
both -partis persist in their claims to abso
lute control of the property. The earnest de
sire of both parties and their Interest in pre
venting any further disturbance in the â¢ mar
ket from the troubles of the shorts Is very
clear. Yet the shorts have given evidence dur
ing the weok of continued trouble. " The in
ference la thereby made that the : efforts of
the ermtMidinK Interests In Northern Pacific to
relieve the ehorts do not go eo far â¢ as to sell
them Ftock or even to lend -.them certificates
for delivery. The market Is almost absolutely
bar* of the \ stock and the rise Jn Its price
thi* week to 205 Indicates that there Is no re
laxation In the closÂ»neÂ«s with which it is held
by the two rival Interests. The rival interests
allowed the shorts whose selling contracts they
hold to settle at the riven figure of 150^ But
clearly others than . the rival " interests hold
nellintr contracts for which there 'is no stock
t<r deliver and arc exacting higher terms." . This
â¢â¢eir- nartlcularSy troÂ« of.. the : London market.
NEW YORK, May 25.â There vu no evi
dence of interest in to-day's stock market be
yond the manipulation by professionals in a
limited number of stocks. The action of the
market ehowed that many brokers and traders
followed the midsummer custom of not coming
to the exchange at all for the short session
of Saturday. Some of yesterday's movements,
which gave good promise of a period of activ
ity in the epecial stocks at least, received an
untimely check. This was true of the Tobacco
stocks, which started a vigorous rise, but
which ended with sharp losses. The South
westerns were temporarily strong on pub
lished admissions from interests in the com
panies that plans were working out from the
consolidation and extension of the properties.
Wheeling and Lake Erie issues strengthened
In sympathy. The rumors that an important
ehort interest In Northern Pacific had effected
a private settlement, which was an influence
In yesterday's rally, had lost their force to
day. This was partly due to the lack of any
authoritative information on the j subject.
"While the completion ot a settlement with the
ehortc would be regarded with relief, as re
moving a threat of further forced liquidation
from the market, the obvious pressure to se
cure actual deliveries of certificate! leaves the
inference strong that thÂ© Northern Pacific dis
pute still remains open. An exchange author
ity states that the struggle Is not yet passed.
A Bale of Northern Pacific at 210 to-day re
vived rumors of further competition for the
Ftock. The closing: to-day was ISO bid and 210
asked. The strong position of the banks dis
closed by the bank statement failed to re
vive the market. .

Matters of Interest to Trade Consid
ered in Executive Session, but
No Results Beached.
A pleasant conference between men con
nected with the wholesale grocery trade
was held yesterday afternoon In tha rooms
of the "San Frandaco Board of Trade.
Employers and their men met together In
social i converse. ; Means â¢ of reaching 1 tha
best results were discussed and & pleasant
and profitable afternoon was spent.
The affair was In charge of the Asso
ciated "Wholesale Grocers. William Cluft
presided and A. L. Ehrman was the secre
tary." Every man who has an interest In
the trade was present and freely . ex
pressed his vlÂ»ws. No set programme' was
followed, each man responding 1 to tha call
of the chair. ; " /
Considerable information of value to the
employers was given in these impromptu
speeches, and many a retail grocer was
scored for his lax < methods in buying
goods. If ' the city drummers had their
way, according to tfie "spiels" they made,
every corner grocery store in town would
be filled to repletion. , j>

WASHINGTON, May 25.â To-day's statement

cash balance.- $158,861,891; gold, $94,642,094. . ;Â¦
Condition of the Treasury.
To-day Is. a holiday on the London and Liv
erpool exchanges. They will also be closed
Monday. '
LONDON, May 25.â Money, 2%@3 . per cent.
Bar silver, quiet at 27 7-16d per ounce.
London Market.
The Financier says: The statement ; of the
Associated Banks of New York ior the week
ending May 25 . is more in . harmony with
known movements of money than the previous
exhibit, although as a matter of fact thera is
still a considerable discrepancy between act
ual movements of the two weeks just ended
and the clearing house totals of Saturday.
This is variously accounted for on the plausible
explanation of the unsettled conditions pre
vailing Â¦ eince - May 9, which | have really been
such as to make up for the differences noted.
The gain in cash for the week amounted to
$5,361,600, all of which came from . interior
points.
Treasury operations show a loss. The de
crease of $14,639,500 In loans, following the
violent contraction of the ' previous week,
makes a total shrinkage In fourteen aays of.
nearly $39,000,000. It is not difficult to explain
this liquidation, which measures to a greater
or less extent the process of settlement which
has been going on since the Stock Exchange
panic of May 9. Whether thMs disturbing cause
has been eliminated cannot T5e stated, but -in
view of present conditions, there 's nothing
on which to base a prediction of a loan item.
The entire trend, of bank operations for two
weeks haa been to strengthen cash reserves,
the week's addition of cash amounting to
over $5,000,000 and the release of $2,620,000 ow
ing to a decrease of $10,509,800 in denosits hav
ing added $7,989,050 in surplus, bring the total
above the 25 per cent requirement of $21,258,
975, the larcest amount' reported Â¦Â¦. since the
opening of February. Â¦ This is a natural se
quence of violent stock exchange operations
and has " been witnessed many times in the
past. It is due not only to the contraction,
but to supplies of cash which were attracted
to this center by. reason of temporary high In
terest rates prevailing. : The ultimate effect is
in the direction of lower Interest ratos, but this
does not follow as a corollary Incident. There
is nothing to indicate an unusually large accu
mulation of idle reserve at this time. The
treasury, owing to excess revenue, will prob
ably absorb an appreciable volume off funds,
and gold exports, while small, are taking gome
money out of the banks. Last but not least,
current business Is heavy and Its Oemands are
an appreciable factor, especially, at this sea
son of the year. Monetary conditions,- viewed
in every light, are .stable, and give no cause
for concern. . . " . " . . -

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
The moratorium granted to the "Northern Pa
cific ehorts in that market at the last settle
ment has been extended through the next set
tlement and to June 10, with the expressed
hope that the contending interests in Northern
Pacific will have arrived at some arrange
ment by that time. This revelation that there
<s still a short interest in Northern Pacific in
a parlous state and the deduction drawn that
the dispute for Northern Pacific control Is sliil
open has had a decidedly disturbing effect on
sentiment. The application of the Union Pa
cific to the Stock Exchange to list the full
authorized issue of JIOO.000,000 of- convertible
bonds has given occasion for some selling of
the stock. It Is known that $40,000,000 of this
issue has already been, sold to provide the
purchase money for the Southern Pacific. The
supposition is general that the remaining $60,
000,000 is designed to reimburse the cost of the
Northern Pacific stock bought In the interest
of Union Pacific. Wall street has asked Itself
how far tha heavy amounts of Union Pacific
sold at high prices during the boom have rep
resented the extra Issue of stock authorized
to be exchanged against these, bonds. The be
lief has grown up during the week that some
of the operations in the stock market represent
efforts to secure a trunk line outlet to the
Atlantic coast for the Southwestern Railroad
system. The buying of Eries and the strength
of Lackawanna have both been attributed to
this cause. The projected Wabash extension
to Pittsburg and the Wabash demands in
passenger rates are pointed to as corroborative
evidence of a desire for a control of the trunk
lines. -
Reports have circulated that protests have
been lodged against the execution of this pro
ject by representatives of other trunk lines.
Some uneasiness has been expressed lest an
other conflict between leading railroad inter
ests was thus foreshadowed. The relaxation
In foreign money markets has been a favor
able factor, although the local money mar
ket has shown no sign of any lack of supply.
The decline in speculative activity, has, in fact.
led to growing ease of money. But the fear
expressed that money difficulties might con
front the London market has caused some
dread of a sympathetic effect here. During
the week the Paris market has apparently
satisfied its requirement for the Russian loan
floatation and has relaxed its pressure upon
London, so that the Bank of England was
able on Thursday to secure an arrival of $2,
500,000 In gold in the open market, which it
was feared might go to the Continent. The
Paris demand for gold in connection with the
Russian loan has Â« been" unexpectedly light,
owing to the strong position of the Bank of
France, Â¦which holds a stock of gold only sec
ond in amount to that in the United States
Treasury, and which. has been making 20 per
cent of Its payments in gold.
Some " financial authorities are beginning to
maintain that the claims of the United States
for gold on account- ' o* - merchandise bala.nce
have been practically wiped out by the large
return" of 'American securities <to the home
market during the late speculative furor. It
is worthy of note, however, that while gold
went, out from New York this, week a ship
ment was made from. Sydney: to San Fran
cisco. The receipt of the first drlbblings of
gold from the Transvaal, mines is attracting
attention In Europe. With, the lighter demand
for money there on account of dull business,
growing confidence is felt that further mon
etary needs in London will be supplied.
The bond market has been quiet and the
movement of prices Irregular.
Government bonds were unchanged on the
call prices as compared with a week ago.

NATIVES WISH
TO CELEBRATE
Preliminary Steps for
Observing Admis
sion Day.
Local Parlors Invite Those
Across the Bay to
Assist.
There was a meeting last night In Na
tive Sons' Hall of representatives from
the local parlors assembled ln pursuance
of -a call issued by; California Parlor to
determine if the order should have a cele T
bration on September 9.- There were pres
ent representatives from seventeen of the
twenty-three parlors. James P. Dockery
was chosen temporary president and W.
J. Wynn temporary secretary.. ._.
Statements were made that as the
Grand Parlor at its last held session had
not selected a place to hold a celebration
this year Stanford. El | Dorado. Presidio
and National parlors had made arrange
ments to have individual celebrations, and
that the Past Presidents' Association in
tended to have a grand celebration on
that day. â¢ . . â¢ Â¦ .
It was stated that there is no objection
to the Past Presidents' Association hold-
Ing a celebration, but that it is not the
Native Sons' organization, and that it is
the duty of the parlors to hold the cele
bration.
After an interchange of views it was
decided to have the local parlors have a
celebration collectively.
While this meeting was in session the
Past Presidents' Association held a meet
ing to take action in regard to the cele
bration. A committee from that body vis
ited the joint Ninth of September com
mittee and suggested that the latter body
abandon its contemplated demonstration
and allow the Past Presidents' Associa
tion to give Its. grand excursion, so as to.
raise funds to replete its treasury.
This proposition was not received with
much favor, on the- ground that the cele
bration should not be turned, into a
money-making scheme.
The Past Presidents' Association then
withdrew the proposition.
Homer A. Prindle of San Jose extended
an invitation to hold the annual celebra
tion in that city. . -
It was decided that the parlors of Ala
xneda and Marln counties each send repre
sentatives to the general committee to
take part in the permanent organization.
A motion to -defer permanent organiza
tion and the selection of the place for
celebrating was carried.
J. B. Keenan, W. N. Brunt and T. C.
Comny were appointed a committee to ob
tain rates of transportation, after which
the committee adjourned.
Peter Martin I* to wed Miss Lillie Oel
richs of New York. No announcement
has been made of the engagement and
the parents of the young lady are said to
persistently deny all rumors of a be
trothal, but,Â« nevertheless, Peter Martin
has won the heart and the promise of
the hand of Miss Oelrichs and their wed
ding will probably be one of the events
of the early fall season.
The friends of Peter Martin, while they
willingly admit that an engagment be
tween the young couple positively exists,
strenuously deny ' that there Is any rea
son why their betrothal â¢ has not as yet
been made public It may be a romantic
idea, this desire to keep the betrothal a
secret, they argue, or else the happy
nance's love of fun and his wish to keep
his friends guessing. However, It will
not be many days before the young cou
ple will let the world into their sweet
secret.
Peter Martin, is expected home for the
wedding: of his brother Walter and Miss
Mary Scott, and everybody believes that
his engagement to Miss Oelrichs will be
announced before he leaves New York for
this city.
The young lady who will shortly become
Mrs. Peter Martin is the daughter of
Charles Oelrichs of New York and niece
of Herman Oelrichs. She is a beauty and
a belle and enjoys the esteem and affec
tion of all who are fortunate enousrh to
know her. Her marriage to Mr. Martin
will make her a welcome addition to local
society.
Peter Martin, the lucky man. Is the son
of Mrs. Eleanor Martin and the brother
of Downey, Harvey and Walter Martin.
He Is Independently rich and immensely
popular. . He is . a member of several of
the swell local clubs, of the San - Mateo
Hunt Club and the Burlingame Country
Club.
At present Mr. Martin Is in New York.
During- his stay ln the Empire City he
has been extensively entertained by Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Oelrichs, the parents
of his fiancee.
New York Belle Will Be His
Bride, Notwithstanding
Denials.
His Engagement to Miss

. The last : boat "carrying the picnickers
left the grounds at 5:30 o'clock, and.lt was
the general expression of opinion that tHe
second, annual outing of the employing
printers was a success in every way. â¢
The employing printers of San Francisco
enjoyed t the â¢ pleasures of a picnic .with
their employes at El j Campo yesterday.
Three" boats, , loaded to . the guards with
picnickers, landed at the pleasure ground*
during the day. .Though the weather was
chilly, the pleasure seekers dispelled- the
cold by keeping the fun going until late
in the afternoon. , T . .
r It was 'a 'family basket picnic, .and seat
ed around the delicacies that become more
delicious with a picnic appetite millionaire
employers dined with their, most, humbl*
employes. There was dancng all day, the
orchestra being exceptionally good. 1 Dur
ing an intermission the orchestra rendered
a feeling selection dedicated to Past Pres
ident George F. Neal, entitled "His Whis
kers Still Grew.'" Mr. .Neal gracefully ac
cepted the compliment thus tendered him
by the orchestra. Â¦
One feature which the picnickers looked
forward to â¢ was * denied a place, on * the
programme at the suggestion of the Cali
fornia and Northwestern Railroad Com
pany, which owns the grounds. A snake
charmer sought permission . to exhibit his
reptiles for .the edification of the printers;
The railroad people said'- there were
enough snakes ln the drinkables that find
their way to El Campo during: a season
without exposing the .young people, who
enjoy a tete-a-tete out In. the wooded hills
to the unwelcome , embrace of a snake
that' might .perchance* escape from the
charmer Â¦ while some Â¦ one was offering : a
toast to his genius and hypnotic eye. :
