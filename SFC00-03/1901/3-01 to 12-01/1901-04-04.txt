ments are different In many respects, and.
therefore, the park and boulevard act Is In
consistent with the charter. The result de
clared by the constitution where such Incon
sistency exists must follow, namely: th<*
park and boulevard act has been superseded
by the charter. That act being superseded by
the charter, it is gone from the case. It went
lnstanter the moment the charter took effect.
It is no more a law applicable to- the city
and county of Ean Francisco: and Its provi

proceeding.
May these bonds now be Issued under the
provisions of the charter? It cannot be done:

MAYOR TO URGE
A NEW ELECTION
It is Indeed discouraging to hear that
the Supreme Court has held I that the
issuance of bonds for park ! extension,
schoolhouses. - hospitals and"' sewers Is
invalid. I understand, without having
seen the opinions, that the court holds
that the charter supersedes the general
laws under which tne bond elections
were held in December, 1839. : If this is
true, there Is consolation In the fact
that the charter is supreme within its
field. The proceedings were all 'taken
and the election held before the charter
went into effect, to avoid this point,
and our attorneys argue that, as the
charter government was the successor
of the government under. the consolida
tion act, it was competent for us to
Issue the bonds authorized. Just as pro
ceedings taken under .the State insol
vency laws continue to completion 'Â¦Â¦ al
though the Federal bankruptcy act has
intervened. ,
One of the reasons why the elections
were held In December. 1S99, .was be
cause the attorneys- advised that if
they were held after January 1 thera
would have to be a rereglstratlon un
der the new registration law before
any election- could be ' held, which
would have postponed the project for
As all the Improvements received the
enthusiastic approval of more than
two-thirds of the people, we feel con
fident that. In calling another election,
which I shall recommend for this pur
pose, the people will ratify their pre
vious action; so, in my Judgment, this
setback and disappointment will only
result in a better understanding of the
question, and enable us to Issue bonds
about the .validity of which there shall
be no question. 'The supremacy of the
charter had to be decided, and it Is
Just as well that It Is decided In this
case. That Is - a. point' gained which
cannot be underestimated, and I am
satisfied the people will 'be content to
suffer the disappointment of delay in
view of>ll the circumstances..
"We have six months' Interest and
sinking fund on hand and $10,000 for
the, examination of abstracts, which
has not been used. The city is now in
a prosperous condition generally, and
with this money on hand, we are in a
position to go ahead. I hope there
will be no further obstructions or de
lays." "The decision has clarified thÂ»
atmosphere and it has made the. sail
ing easy.
I am satisfied the Supervisors will be
in accord with these views, and, as it
is necessary to vote for the bonds at
a special . election, ; such Â¦ an election
should be Immediately called. '.The city
is suffering for schools, hospitals and
better drainage, and 'our park "should
be brought down to r Market -street at
the small expense for which it can now
be accomplished. ' and this generation
of San Franciscans should get the* ben
efit of these great Improvements which
must inevitably come.â Statement made

O. K. Cushlng, president of the Fed- '
eratlon of jWestern Addition Improve- \
ment Clubs', is greatly disappointed at â¢
the adverse decision of the Supreme '
Court. .In' speaking of the matter he \
said: "I deeply regret the failure of .
the Supreme Court to sustain the va- '
lldlty of the bond election. It is the '
opinion both of - myself and the other .
members of the Improvement clubs Â¦
that the city eannr>t possibly exist '

without a bond issue of some kind. It' <
is only a question of time before bonds '
must be circulated. The city has . at- .

by certain pressing needs, which can- '
not possibly be met through the me- \
dlum of ordinary taxation. We should .
Immediately prepare for a new bond â¢

DOHRfllANN IS
NOT SURPRISED
}Â¦ In its opinion declaring the municipal bond election null and void, the Supreme Court holds that
the scheme provided by the charter for the creation of a bonded indebtedness, being materially different
from, the scheme provided by: th& park and. boulevard act, under 'which the election was held, a proceed
ing inuagurated under the one cannot be continued under the other. It is further held that the park
and boulevard act, a general law, was superseded by the charter and, so far as the city and county of San
Francisco is concerned, is no longer applicable. Hence, when the park and boulevard act was super
seded by the charter, at that moment the proceedings inaugurated under the provisions of*the act for the
acquisition of lands for park purposes and public utilities felL In conclusion the court holds, though
Justice Temple expresses some doubt on the point, that the charter provides a complete scheme for the
acquisition of lands, public utilities and other improvements. by the issuance of bonds, "and," says the
court, "JWe find a complete scheme laid down in the provisions of the charter to accomplish the same re
sults as those attempted' under the park and boulevard act."
. ' . : DECISION was handed down yes
f\ : terday by the Supreme Court ad
i==^\ judging the bond election, held In
Â¦"â¢ 1S99, null and void. Un
der this decision ribt only, are the
time, energy and money expanded in com
pleting the preliminaries and carrying
through the election absolutely lost, but
the vast scheme of acquiring property for
the extension" of the Panhandle,' the con
nection of Golden Gate Â¦ Park with the
Presidio, the acquisition of two blocks in
the Mission for park purposes, the con
struction of the projected sewer system
and the erection of through
out the" city have fallen. If these pro
posed improvements -are to be carried
through. by the city, the scheme for their
acquisition muEt rise from the ruins of
the effort that has failed, and must pro
ceed in'strict conformity with the' pro
visions of the charter.
The decision of the Supreme Court was
reached in the actions . instituted by
Eugene .' M. Fritz and Felix McHugh
against the city and 1 county of San
Francisco. The first -named - plaintiff
sought to enjoin the Board of Supervisors
and the Mayor from taking action in pur
suance of proceedings' previously ' in
augurated and having for their object the
issuance of bonds for the acquisition of
lands for park purposes from the proceeds
thereof. ThÂ«' last named plaintiff sought
the 1 same remedy in relation to
the proposed - bond issue for the
construction of the projected' sewer
system and new schoolhouses. ;' It
was claimed! by both plaintiffs that
tho .bond J : election was Illegal -and
that bonds â¢issued ' thereunder;;, would
hence be null and"; void. -the Superior
Court demurrers : to the .complaints were
sustained pro * forma and on. the ruling
appeal was taken. In the decision of the
Supreme Court the judgment of the lower
tribunal \ is reversed and Â¦ the causes re
manded. The decision, however, is final.
Number of Votes Required.
' After briefly reviewing . the issues in
volved in the. actions, the Supreme Court
passes directly to the point as to whether
it was necessary under the park . and
boulevard act for two-thirds of all the
qualified electors of the city and county
to vote In favor of the issuance of bonds
in" order to carry the same, or If the
votes of two-thirds. of those who actually
voted . were Sufficient to carry the meas
ure. That provision of the: act which
reads: "If at such an election two-thirds
of the Qualified electors voting assent to
the issuance of the bonds" â¢ â¢ â¢ the
court' holds, "means exactly what it says,
and says only one thing," hence the vote
of two-thirds of these electors who ac
tually vote 'in favor of the measure is
sufficient to carry it.
Though the opinion of . the court . sup
ports the fact that a sufficient number of
the electors of the city and county voted
in favor of the measure to carry- the
same, this decision will only be of impor
tance in â¢ future elections, for the. Court
proceeds from the favorable decision on
this point to tear apart the fabric woven
by counsellor, the city in support of the
legality of the. bond election. It says:
Proceeded Under General Law.
The proceedings taken by the city leading up
to the election here Involved, were had under
a general law, the decision reads. This elec
tion was held In the j latter part of the month
of , December, * 1899, " and the present Â¦ charter

OPERATION OF THE NEW CHARTER
NEW YORK, April 3.â The Harri
man syndicate gave a practical
demonstration to-day that It con-
P trolled the Southern Pacific Com
pany, road and branch. The to
tai number of shares outstanding is 1,978,
233. There â¢were voted at the annual meet
ing to-day 1,7Â«,729 shares, of which E. H.
Harriman held proxies for 931,429 shares.
No opposition developed to the plan of
the controlling interest. An amendment
to the by-laws was passed increasing the
number of directors from twelve to fif
teen. The following new board was then
elected : E. IÂ£. Harriman. Jacob H.
Schiff, George J. Gould, James Stillman,
Charles H. Tw*ed, Otto IL Kuhn, Charles
M. Hays. Edwiiv^ Hawley. James H. Hyde,
T. Jefferson Coolidge Jr., "Wlnslow S.
Pierce, J. W. Mackay, D. O. Mills, James
Bpeyer and H. E. Huntington.
The new men are T. Jefferson Coolidge
Jr. of Boston, George J. Gould, E. II.
Harriman, James Btillman, James H.
Hyde, Jacob H. Schiff and Otto H. Kuhn.
They are representatives of the Union
Pacific and the ' Harriman syndicate,
â¢which recently acquired the property.
New Board Organizes.
The election of George J. Gould to the
board was regarded with 'much interest
in Wall street in view of pending develop
ments in Gould properties in the South
west. Although a member of the Union
Pacific board and identified with the Har
riman syndicate until the present, It has
not been Gould's inclination to prominent
ly Identify himself with properties other
than those of the Gould system.
The new board met later In the day for
organization. Charles H. Tweed was re
elected chairman of the board of direc
tors, and the following executive commit-
tee was selected: George J. Gould, E. H.
Harriman, Edwin Hawley, Otto H. Kuhn,
Jacob H. Schiff. James Speyer and James
Stillman, with Charles H. Tweed ex-offl
cio. Harriman was elected chairman of
the executive committee. No other busl-
ness of public importance was transacted,
according to Chairman Tweed.

The Mail aafl Express, discussing

board, gays:

CAUSES SURPRISE HERE.
The Old-Timers Hope H.'E. Hunting-
ton "Will Return.'
A dispatch announcing the new director
ate of the Southern Pacific Company. was
received early yesterday afternoon in the
railroad building and in a short time was
public property. The make-up- of the
new board of directors was; a great sur
prise to all local officials, and much dis
cussion was indulged in as . to . the . new
plans of the company. Huntington w-.snot
expected to be a member of the board of
directors and now that he has received
this honor, news of the election of officers
of the Southern Pacific, which occurs to
day, is anxiously awaited by all local
railroad men, who wish to know if he
â¢will still hold a position as a vice presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company.
The selection of the board of directors is
looked upon as a very diplomatic one in
local railroad circles. The board, which
Â¦was formerly composed of twelve mem
bers, has been increased to fifteen. This
board can be safely described as repre
senting two interests. Seven of the
members are active Southern Pacific men,
their affiliations dating, back to the C. P.
Huntington regime. â¢Â¦ Seven represent the
Union Pacific Railroad.; and one uninter
ested person is selected to settle all dis
putes and controversies that may arise.
The , Southern Pacific members, of the
board are Charles H. Tweed (chairman),
Charles M. Hays, Edward Hawley. H. E.
Huntington, John W. Mackay.'D. O. Mills
and James Speyer. The Union Pacific
Railroad is represented by T. Jefferson
Coolidge. E. H. Harriman. James H.
Hyde, Otto H.Kuhn. Winslow S. Pierce.
Jacob Scheff and .James H. Stillman.
George J. Gould, the other member of the
board, is looked upon as the go-between,
or the man with the controlling vote.
It Is considered the strongest railroad
board in the world and each member is a
man of cither valuable railroad executive
ability or of very substantial I' financial
standing.. The executive board Is, com
posed of men who are residents .of. New
York and the fact that Hi E. Huntington
is not on this committee Is â¢ looked- upon
make an alliance with rime of them. It
is not to be supposed from to-day's de
velopments that the" Missouri Pacific will
in the future use the Central Pacific from
Ogden to the coast. By the acquisition of
the Rio Grande Western and the Denver
and Rio Grande it now has a through line
from St. Louis to Ogden." ...

COMPLICATIONS PRDICTED.
It May Be Impossible for Russia to
. , Leave Manchuria.
WASHINGTON, . April \ 3.'â The St.
Petersburg dispatch to. the Associated
Press, printed this morning/ iiaa aroused
interest in official circles here. â ; For the
same reason that prevented the corre
spondent from quoting aHy3 authority in
the~Russlan Government aa;a : source of
the suggestion contained in ; his dispatch,
it is not possible to cite official authority
for the comment that has : been passed
here upon the, suggested . Russian plea.
This in , brief is that the action of the
powers in opposing the Manchurian agree
ment will make it impossible for Russia
â¢ to Jeave Manchtfria* a t -4.1K ffiffij commen t
upon 'Â¦ this suggested Tplea is" ; that Russia
deliberately proposes to commit a greater
, offense in the permanent seizure of Man
churia if the powers will not connive at a
lesser one in allowing her to make a secret
and private agreement with China. ' This
plea, it is said, would be laughed out of
any court of international law, so disin
genuous is it. Russia Is displeased be
cause the powers discouraged China from
signing the agreement, yet Russia herself
joined with the other powers in undertak
ing to avoid any. such private arrange
ment involving the acquisition of Chinese
territory. Even if she persists, even if
she forces China to sign the Manchurian
agreement^ there is no obligation upon
the powers and certainly not upon the
United States, to whom this Russian
pledge was given, to look upon it as. bind
ing at any point. By the same reasoning
should Russia, failing to secure an agree
ment, continue in Manchuria beyond a
reasonable time, there is no obligation
upon any power to respect her title and
it may be predicted that this subject will
lead to controversy of the gravest char
acter. .' ' .
THREATS NOT EXECUTED.
Russia's Failure to Intimidate China
Is a Hopeful Sign.
LONDON, April 4.â In a dispatch to the
Times from Peking, dated Tuesday. Dr.
Morrison : says : Â»
"A week has elapsed, but Russia has
done nothing to carry her threats into
execution.' Li Hung Chang "continues
vainly to implore the court to modify
its decision not to sign the Manchurian
convention, but in view of the attitude
of -the country it is hardly possible that
China would sign unless Russia materially
abates her demands.
"This remarkable stand "is a hopeful
sign of vitality and should affect _ favor
ably the whole course of the negotiations,
if the powers seize" the opportunity to
quicken the pace."

As Mr. Moore was a man of extraord
inary mechanical ability he was invalu
able to our pioneer miners and to all en
gaged in industrial pursuits requiring ma
chinery. The early development o* the
Pacific Coast led to some very bold engi
neering propositions, and no one here dvd
more toward the attainment of successful
results than Joseph Moore.
Among Mr. Moore's inventions was the
Bagasse feeders and furnace for sugar
mills for burning, "trash" direct from the
rolls, and these are still used. He made
a practical success of hydraulic pumping
on the Comstock after all other systems
had failed.
Mr. Mcore built the first hydraulic ele
vator or passenger hoist and much other
hydraulic machinery, and In recognition
of his work in this branch of mechanics
the Royal Society of Engineers of Great
Britain awarded him a special gold medal.
He also built the first tangential dis
charge waterwheel, from which afterward
was evolved what is now known as the
Pelton wheel. He had an aversion to tak
ing out patents. He did, however, patent
among other things Â¦ a differential
hydraulic valve gear which is used on all
classes of hydraulic . work as well as by
the Crane & Otis Elevator Company,
which bought it from Mr. Moore.
Mr. Mcore leaves four sons and two
daughters. In the education Â¦ of his sons
he adopted a different course than is
usual. They were first made to learn a
trade and "subsequently sent to the Uni
versity of- California. The eldest son,
Andrew, is and has been for years man
ager of the Paauhau .plantation in Ha
waii, and the youngest son, Joseph, is as
sistant superintendent. The second son,
Robert, is manager of the Risdon Iron
Works of this city, and the third son,
Ralph, is manager of the Spreckels sugar
refinery at the Potrero. Mr. Moore leaves
a large fortune, consisting mainly of busi
ness property, all located in San Fran

Again, it Is plain that the notice to electors
actually eriven for this election was not the
notice demanded by the charter, and no issue
of bonds under the provisions of the charter
can be valid which has not the pupport of an
election held under a notice specifying in sub
stance all matters designated In section 9 of
article XII of the charter. The notice relied
on in this case did not comply with the pro
visions of that, section, and, therefore, no issue

This opinion was written by.. Justice
Garoutte and was concurred in by Jus

concurring opinion, reaching -the same
conclusion, but on slightly different
grounds. Justice Temple states in his
opinion that he understands that the park
and bo'ulevard act was relied upon be
cause the city authorities were of the
opinion that the" charter of Itself did not
authorize the purchase, of lands for park
purposes. "And," says Justice Henshaw.
' 'since the charter specifies a great many

The court Is satisfied that" the acquisition of
these lands for park purposes, by the city
would be an acquisition by the city and county
cf a permanent municipal Improvement within
the spirit and Intent of the charter. If Golden
Gate Park may be designated as a permanent
municipal improvement of the city and county
of San Francisco then the extension of that
park by way of boulevards -to the military
reservation and to Van Ness avenue are Im
provements of . a like character. ; It. Is thug
apparent that the acquisition of this property
b} the city and county Is authorized by the
charter quoted, wherein the power to acquire
permanent municipal improvements is granted.
After pointing- out the material differ
ences between the provisions Â¦ of the park
and boulevard act and the charter in re
latlon to the manner in which bonds may
be issued the court concludes its opinloi;
by saying:
The scheme provided by the charter for the
creation of a bonded indebtedness beine ma
terially different from the scheme provided by
the park and boulevard act for the creation of

General?'^MacArthur's dispatch, as well

the exact character of these alleged pecu

"sales." These sales consist of savings
by the soldiers on < the regular ration is
sued, which they are allowed to dispose
of for their own benefit. â¢ Generally the
savings are made a company matter and
are disposed of in bulk to the highest
bidder. .They may be returned to the
commissary department and bought in by
the Government.at cost prices, but there
is no reason why, they should not be sold
elsewhere if the managers of the com
pany funds should so desire. .. As army
rations, do not pay the â¢ usual duty im
posed on similar, goods used for private
consumption, the soldiers â¢ could" Â¦ make
quite a profit on their -savings if they
Â¦were of considerable amount. Sales from
commissary stores, not including 'the reg
ular ration, are made to officers and men,
but onlyupon a certificate or declaration
that they are for the personal use of the
purchaser. ; It is - said that no great
amount of such sales could be used by
any person or persons without detection..
Officers or men -purchasing such stores
and reselling them would be guilty of viO'.
lating the army regulations and would be
subject to court-martial. As to the other
savings, there are upon the regular ra
tions issued to each company. They
might be in flour, meat, sugar or any
number of staple articles-included in the
ration. - The money procured from the
sale of such savings is usuaJly devoted
to the. purchase of such supplies as are
not included in the ration and many deli

"The triple alliance is closely bound up
with the commercial conventions of three
partners,' conventions which at present
are favorable to Italian trade in Ger
many and Austria-Hungary; but Italy will
apparently find considerable difficulty in
getting those countries to renew such ar
ticles in the commercial conventions as
favor the import of Italian products.
Therefore, with a view of widening her
commercial and improving her political
relations with France, Italy may decline
to renew certain clauses of the contract
bearing upon her military and other con
tributions. Any such relief to Italy's ob
ligations must necessarily be adding to the
military position of France in Europe. .
"Thus." concluded the diplomat, "while
the meeting of M. Loubet and the Duke
of Genoa, together with the Franco-Ital
ian naval demonstration, must ' not be
taken as a prelude to the withdrawal of
Italy from the triple alliance, yet it may
herald a noteworthy modification of the
international situation. We do not wish
for a written convention with Italy. We
believe the re-establishment of thoroughly
sympathetic relations between the two
people will prove of greater worth than
any existing treaties." * - -
Improvement of Trade Assured.
"The great significance of the coming
event lies in the ract that it indicates that
tne irritation felt ny.luuy_towara .flrance,..
which was arousea by ttieFrencn occu
pation of Tunis, and wmch, rankling in
the minds of Italian. statesmen, has uone
to much to injure our mutual. relations,

a desire of a" better understanding be

"We shall now be able to discuss" the
questions that are pending between the
two countries, notably the political situ
ation in the Mediterranean, with a better
disposition on both sides and a brighter
prospect of a satisfactory understanding.
The commercial convention concluded last
year was an Important factor in bringing
about this feeling between the peoples
themselves. A great improvement in our
mutual trade has resulted from that con
vention. Silk firms in Lyons and other
manufacturers in the southeastern dis
tricts of France have established branches
and now maintain close business relations
with Milan and other towns in Northern
Italy. Commercial houses in these latter
cities have made similar extensions to
Lyons and other French trade centers.
"As a result there has been a revival of
appreciation in Italy of the importance
of the French market. The invasion of
North Italy by the Germans, who, in cer
tain branches of industry, especially those
requiring highly scientific methods, have
been crowding the Italians out of their
own markets, has engendered jealousy
and been instrumental in directing the at
tention of the Italian business community
toward France.
Enmity Will Disappear.
cemonstration at Toulon does not imply
that at all. We have no reason to expect
that Italy will detach herself* from the

every reason to expect that she, will re^

W.. 'WASHINGTON. April 3.â Colombia
has demanded of the United States the
recognition of the principle of neutrality
In the agreemsnt she hopes to reach with
this country contemplating its completion,
of the Panama canal.
This condition is included in a memor
andum submitted by Minister Sllva to Sec
retary Hay. embodying the terms upon
which his Government is willing to trans
fer the canal to the United States. J. F.
Ford, consulting engineer of the Colom
bian Government and attache of the Co
lombian legation, made this authoritative
statement this afternoon regarains tho
terms offered the United Statps:
"The proposition made by Colombi i
amounts to something like the transfer or
a house in which there is a tenant. Th j
rights of the tenant are guaranteed witn
certain reservations and they must be re
spected. Colombia must have an interest
in the future tolls of the canal which shaM
be more than. or. at least, eauivalent co.
what she would receive under the eonces
slon held by the Panama Canal Company.
Hence the capital cost of the construc
tion of the canal will not be affected oy
any financial agreement Colombia mlarnt
wish to make respecting the future. Tne
capital cost of construction of the canal
will not be Increased over the estimate of
cost fixed by the American Isthmian Canal
Commission. _Â¦*'-:'Â¦
"Colombia offers to the United States
control and operation of the canal, possi
bly in perpetuity. The United States must
guarantee Colombia's political sovereignty
over the terrjtory now Included in the
Department of Panama. Colombia re
quires at present an observance of th j
principle of general neutrality as proviu
ed for in the Clay ton-Bui wer treaty, whici
she will not discuss, but which she doea
not in any way wish to violate. A careful
reading of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty will
show that It is strictlv limÂ»ed to a pro
hibition against eith-r the United State*
or Great Britain ever controlling or owr.
ingr the Nicaragua canai, which is specifi
cally mentioned in every article except the
eighth. The eighth article establishes tho
general principle of the neutrality of any
canal and then mentions the possibility
of the construction of a canal, either at
Panama or Tehuantepec. thereby further
showing the limitation of the previous ar
ticles.
"Colombia makes an absolutelv squars
business proposition which In every war
is feasible and advantageous to the United
States. The rights of the French com
pany must be respected as far as they g:>
and whatever they may be. In case tho
United States should come to an agree
ment with Colombia it vni be able to treat
with the French company for the acquisi
tion of its property and the French com
pany will receive permission of Colombia,
to negotiate with the "United States, which
at present Is prohibited under Its conces
sion." v ;Â¦-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 3.â Henry E. Miller, a
pupil of the State Normal School here,
who was refused a diploma by the fac
ulty because it was claimed he lacked the
necessary qualifications to become a suc
cessful teacher, ',Â¦ to-day â¢' received a deci
sion in Judge Hyland's court compelling
the faculty to admit him as a student in
the school. " . Â¦. 'Â¦< Â¦. \
About a year ago Miller completed his
course-of study, 1 but -he was -refused a
diploma. Mrs. . Place, the head of the
training department,- declared -he was
unfit to become a teacher. He preferred
charges against Mrs. Place at the â¢ time,
alleging that spite work was her. incen
tive, but the board sustained the teacher.
Later the case was taken into court on
a writ of" mandate directed against,Pro
fessor McNaughton, who was then -prin
cipal. This action was defeated on de
murrer. -....,â¢ â¢Â¦Â¦ . v . . Â¦
Subsequently the trustees of the school
passed a resolution refusing Miller admis-:
sion to complete his course of study. An
other writ was then obtained against
Principal Dalley. . Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦".â¢. Â¦Â¦Â¦>,-
Judge Hyland holds that the board of
trustees, did not have power or. authority
to pass the resolution excluding " Miller
from the school, as Â¦ it deprives him of a
legal right .in an arbitrary Â¦Â¦ manner and
that it is â¢ unreasonable and oppressive.

POLITICIANS OF CUBA
CAUSE THE DIFFICULTY
Itepresentative. Dalzell Returns From
the Island and Explains to Presi
dent Causes of Trouble.
WASHINGTON, April 3.âRepresenta
tive Dalzell of Pennsylvania, who has just
returned from a two weeks' trip to Cuba,
saw the President to-day and talked with
him about conditions there. Mr. Dalzell
said he thought there was hardly a man
in the island, except the politicians, who
did not | favor the acceptance of the con- 4
ditions of independence imposed by the
Platt amendment. ' â¢
"But the politicians are disposed to play
a waiting game," he said. "I believe they
will stand out until Congress meets and
thÂ°n. finding that we will not modify our
terms, they will accept the conditions.
The better element in Cuba favors ultij
mate annexation to the United States, but
I believe a large proportion agree that It
would better come after a trial of inde
pendence has been made."

To-Day's Entries.
FIRST choices In the betting seem
to have encountered another of
their periodical spells of bad luck,
for yesterday at Tanforan out
siders again had .the play pretty
much to themselves.. While several
"carvings" were attempted, . Barklyite,
Walkenshaw and Royalty were about the
only ones put over. Thornwiid breezed in
at odds once as good as 20 to 1, but this
was a stable secret strictly. Spry Lark,
another winner, went to the post prac
tically unbacked at 20 to 1. It remained
for Mike Hennessy to at last come home
astride a favorite, picking off the last
purse with Duckoy, a 9 to 5 chance.
A ragged assortment of cheap ones
went to the post in the opening six-fur
long, sprint, for which Mamie Hildreth
was backed down to favoritism. Mounce
managed to land her in third place. After
Catherine Bravo, had tired, Wedderstrand
took the lead with Thornwiid, a lo to l
shot, winning easily, from Master Cal.
.Berendos, a warm tip, ran badly.
Eleven started in the first part of the
maiden two-year-old event. As Henry
was down to ride Carlo, the St. Carlo
colt ruled a mild- choice over Lulette and
Hainault. The first part of it. Frank
Bain and Lulette, the latter piloted by
Conley, led the others. Under the strong
urging of "Pi" Ruiz, Barklyite responded
gamely, and catching Lulette after pass
ing the paddock, won by a neck. Carlo,
In where the going was deepest, finished
third. O'Connor had (been originally
carded to ride Phyllis, but owing to sick
ness, was replaced by Hafley. The ring
laid 8 to 1 about the winner, coupled with
Achilles. .
As is well known, Walkenshaw is a
pound better horse in the mud- than he
is on dry footing, still the ring laid 9
against the chance of Andy Blakeley s
entry taking the mile selling run. Ruiz
had the mount and taking the front posi
tion early in the race made a gallop or
it from start to finish. Bogus Bill ran
into the place' two lengths ahead of Rio
Chico. Dominick could never . get the
lukewarm choice. Brownie Anderson, up
among the first three. . . ,
On form, Pat Dunne's Silesian looked
best of the starters in the second half of
the maiden two-year-old number, and
from twos his price was chopped to 7 to
5. Outfooted by Oratossa at the start, the
latter to all appearances had the dash
won, when Mounce, on Royalty, came
fast under a full pressure of steam, scor
ing by a scant length. A stout play cut
the winner's price from 7 to 9 to 2.
Pedro Enos must have got tangled up
at the start with the favorite, Dolore, for
the six-furlong spin, fifth to be decided.
Away first, he fell back to seventh place
and was never heard from. Mounce, on
Spry Lark, skimmed off in the lead, win
ning easily at the wire. Backed from 30
to 10, Sweet William downed the, Singer
a neck for the place.
Any number of scratches caused
Duckoy to reign a pronounced favorite
for the closing sprint. Jennie failed to dis
play a particle of speed and the choice led
Urchin out half a length. Claranda ran
third.

LONDON, April 3.â As a result of the
stablemen's strike at Newmarket, the
trainers announce ,that 250 American
st|ableboys will leave New York to-day on
the White Star: and Atlantic transport
steamers. The boys will be drawn most
ly from the racing- establishments of the
Westchester Racing Association,, the
Coney Island Jockey Club,. the Brooklyn
Jockey Club and the Brighton Beach Rac
ing Assoclatlon..^-They must not weigh
over 112: pounds. 1 ? Their wage's- will be
from $6 to ?8 per ' week, ' with board and
lodging. ,. .
The Newmarket trainers at their last
meeting refused to receive a deputation
of the strikers;-"" An additional force of
police has been drafted to Newmarket.
NEW YORK, April 3.â Inquiries made
by the Associated Press at the offices of
the White" Star and Atlantic Transport
companies show -that nothing is -known
there of the reported sailing of 250 Amer
ican stableboys for England. ? The Teu
tonic of the White Star Line sails to-day
and Minnehaha of the Atlantic Transport
Company sails Saturday* .
' The strike of the stablemen at - New
market began March 23. The strikers de
manded an increase of their wages from
20 shillings to 25 shillings per week. They
argue that an honest living Is impossible
on such wages paid for the care -of ani
mals valued at thousands of pounds ster
ling. â¢ .
Mounce' landed two winners.' Ruiz
placed a like number over the line.. .-.. . r
O'Connor was taken ill after the first
race, and the balance of his mounts were
canceled.-
TharÂ© was a deal of talk over the Sir
Kingston race some days ago and the re
markable improvement shown by WaFk
enshaw does give that particular event a
clammy iook. It was claimed by many
that Sir Kingston was "shooed in," and
as the Shields entry won in 1:43*4 over a
fast track - with Walkenshaw back in
fourth place, 5- there must have been a
hitch in the time table somewhere along
the route. Admitted that Walkenshaw is
a mud horse, he can also run over a good
track.
The last time Royalty started he must
have worn snowshoes. - Still: it's always
pleasant to see two-year-olds Improve. .
Loconomo was the hottest tip of the en
tire session. . At first 30 to 1 was chalked
up and the ring resembled the Chicago
wheat pit.. Finally 8 to 1 was laid, fol
lowed by the awakening, i
Jennie appears to be one of the few of
the get of Himyar unable to run in muddy
going. .

CHICAGO/. April 3.â George H. Phillips,
whose daring operations in grain have
made him the cynosure of all speculative
eyes interested in the* cereal markets,
passed a crisis in his career, on the Board
of Trade to-day. -. He' was driven from
the wheat pit, the weakest of his de
fenses, but stood firm behind the breast
works of corn and oats which he has
thrown. up during the past few weeks.' .
Monday a call for additional margins
was made and the young speculator put
up $220,000. Yesterday it was reported
that an additional call would be made to
day and that a tremendous onslaught,
calculated to force him to the wall, would
be made by the big operators.
At the tap of the opening gong to-day
the attack came. Â¦ Phillips produced $200,
000 additional margin money In response
to the second call. Severely pressed he
retreated from the wheat' pit after sell
ing 1,500,000 bushels of wheat at a loss
which will probably average V-A cents per
bushel. *;r.\ \
May wheat* opened under Mdn-'
day . at 73%c to 73c ' under the deluge of
sales, but steadied at the decline and re
acted to 72%c. The corn market, in
which Phillips is said to be interested to
the extent of 'eight , or ten million bush
els, broke %@lM>c . at the opening, sell
ing simultaneously from 43%c to 42c.
The volume of business during the first
ten minutes was enormous, but the mar
ket received spirited support from the
young bull leader, who absorbed heavy
lines through brokers. Weak longs
scrambled to get out â¢ from under what
they thought to be a crumbling market,
but others rallied to Phillips' side. The
first outburst over, trade became less ex
cited, and May corn worked gradually
back to 3c. / In oats the attack was also
strenuous, but again Phillips, holding a
line estimated at 5,000,000 bushels, defend
ed himself with great spirit, and the open
ing loss of iÂ£c was nearly, all recovered
during the first hour. '
Other markets, notably St. Louis, were
weakened yesterday by the bears In prep
aration for the. flght here to-day; . it is
said. A decline at Liverpool, it was also
reported, was in a measure due to
manipulations from this side. , * From 43c
May corn on later trading reacted to 40%c.
Profit taking by shorts and buying for a
turn caused a rally from, this to 42%c. The
closing price was 41%c, l%c under Mon
day's close. May wheat closed 2c lower
at 72%@72M>c, after having touched 71%c.
May oats closed %@%c depressed to 24%c.
The afternoon had been as trying as the
earlier part of the day to Phillips, but he
retired from the floor apparently cool and
confident.
"The market," he said, "needed a
shake-up."

EXCITING IS THE POLO CONTEST
ON CITY'S PLEASURE GROUND
The "Under Thirties" and the "Over
Thirties" expressed themselves as being
most satisfied with the day, which as far
as weather went was perfect. The field
was a trifle soft after the rain, but that
was of no material hindrance to the play
ing, which was earnest and even fierce at
times. The "Under Thirties"â the Whites
âwon by a score of 7 to 6. They were
always in the .lead, but to keep this ad
vantage necessitated the closest kind of
hard work and reckless playing. In the
fifth period, with the score 6 to 5, Super
visor Joe Tobin emitted a few oaths as
the Reds were baffled and thrice cheated
of a score by the uncertain reflection of
the ball outside .the' posts. Walter Ho
bart played a star' game, as did Charles
Menzies and Tom Driscoll. .The Mayor
took up the vl.ewp.oint from both Bides of

ies-rscores of them, cared for by grooms

"The pitcher that goes often to the
well is broken at last." There's a world
of wisdom in that familiar proverb, and
a sound application of it to disease,
especially to such familiar forms of dis-
ease as coughs and colds. Singularly
enough the very thing that ought to
cause alarm is given as excuse for a feel-
ing of safety. "It's nothing; only a
cough. I've had it "

The Impression that has gone abroad through
out our country that one of the greatest in
dustries of the past - decade was on the de
cline is a mistaken one. - During the exceed
ingly dull times from IS92 to 'Â¦â¢ 1S96 there was
Â¦no industry that gave employment to such an
army of .first-class mechanics and tool makers
as did the bicycle business. It posslbiy, reached
its zenith in 1895. at which time the prices for
high grade bicycles began to decline very rap
idly, until now instead of $150 being the price
of a high grade bicycle one-third of. that buys
the best there is on the market It is safe to
say that had It not been for pneumatic j tires
the bicycle would never have come into general
uee. This was the one invention that made it
popular almost from the start.
About four years ago another Invention was
brought out that has proven the second great
est Invention ever added to this popular device
It was not like the pneumatic tires however"
in one respect. In that the trade wanted it
at sight, but â¢ it required months and years
of patient, persistent work to convince . the
public that It was what the manufacturers and
inventors claimed for it. The device is known
now as the Morrow Coaster ' and Brake. â¢ At
present . the - factory (a very large one) is be
ing operated day and night, and has been for
the past year.. It has now a capacity of more
than one thousand brakes per day, which are
going to cyclists in air parts of the civilized
world. The . advantage of this well, known
device is that a Â¦ cyclist always has -' his "or
her mount under control, and when going down
a Slight Incline or hill the feet can rest per
fectly still on the pedals, and In case the
speed is too much accelerated, a slight back
ward - pressure of either pedal will set the
brake automatically.â Ithaca Daily Journal.'.
A committee from the Polishers and
Varnishers' Union was before the execu
tive committee of the San Francisco
Federation of Labor last night to urge
the grievance of the union against
Henry Harris, who had his cigar store
fitted up by an unfair shop, and to se
cure some action by the executive com
mittee and the federation favorable to
ths polishers and varnishers.
It was a long session and there was a
great deal of talk, but no action .was
taken by the executive committee until
the visiting committee had departed.
Nor Is it admitted that. any action at all
has been taken, for the executive com
mittee refuses to give out the result cf
its deliberations. The questions dis
cussed were In regard to the attitude of
Harris, and then how far any retaliation
should be prosecuted. The committee will
report to the federation to-morrow night
and then the matter will probably bo
settled. . ",..'..
The visit of the Polishers and Varnish
ers' committee was prompted by the
decision of the Labor Council not to taÂ«*
any action in the boycot until a 'definite
request, accompanied by a recital of. all
the facts, had been presented. There
has oeen no intimation, however, as to
how far the council will go in any In
dorsement it may give, even should it de
cide to mix in the matter.
The following communication has been
presented for publication by Theodore F.
Bonnet, secretary of the Baseball
League, in which he sets forth the atti
tude of the league:
Would Oust Harris.
To the Editor of The Call: The attitude of
the labor organizations of San Francisco
toward the California Baseball League has
been so persistently misrepresented by Civil
Service Commissioner P. II. McCarthy that 1
feel- that laboring men and the public in gen
eral should be vouchsafed a statement of the
facts The directors of the California League
were first informed of the threatened boycott
on oiÂ»about March 1. when Henry Harris, of
the firm of Henry Harris & Co., cigar dealers,
sent me a letter which he had received from
the Building Trades Council informing him
that as he had patronized the L. & E. Eman
uel Company in fitting up his private place of
business his clear store or any place of amuse
ment in which he . was interested would be
subjected to a boycott. Upon inquiry I learned
that the eontrcct for fitting up his store^ was
awarded on or about January 23 by his part
ner, Ted Goodman, the active manager of his
business, who has no interest in the California
Baseball League; tliat he (Goodman) was noti
fied of the unfair character of the Emanuel
Company early in February, and that he then
expressed deep regret at having patronized a
non-union concern. As Mr. Harris has not
more than a one-twelfth interest in the league
1 felt that when Informed of the facts Mr.
McCarthy would see the Injustice of the pro
posed boycott, and that the Building â¢ Trades
Council would be content to attack the cigar
business. I was mistaken. I found that the
Civil Service Commissioner was eager to pun
ish everybody that had the remotest connec
tion with Mr. Harris in a business way, with
the exception perhaps of the Market Street
Railway Company, in which Mr. Harris owns
stock, but which, Mr. McCarthy acknowledges
to me. was too powerful to attack. He told me
that my only redress was to retire from busi
ness or to drive Mr. Harris out, a task which,
I pointed out, was beyond my power. -.Â» .--.Â¦.
Thls conversation took place in the Mayor's
office In the presence of C. W. Fay. the
Mayor's secretary; who suggested that Mr.
Harris might settle the difficulty by selling his
stock, but Mr. McCarthy declared that such
a sale would be viewed with Â¦' suspicion.
Throughout, the ' conversation his manner and
words were those of a man who was in a
position to wield an arbitrary and tyrannical
power, and who purposed doing it.
Meanwhile the Varnishers' â¢ and Polishers'
tlnion. which is a member of the Building
Trades Council, requested through Its dele
gate that the executive committee oT the
Labor Council declare the San Francisco base
ball team (not the league) unfair and that, by
the way, is quite different from asking for a
boycott. The executive committee investigated
the matter and while it was pending I was
assured by members of the committee that they
regarded the action of the Building Trades
Council as unjust: ' , -
At the last meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Labor Council It was decided to take
no action in the matter pending a Tnore definite,
request from j the Vamishers' and Polishers'
Union and at a meeting of the whole council
Friday night the wji-iort of .the executive com-
A panoramic view of certain industries
of California is afforded by the eleventh
annual report of President N. P. Chip
man of the State Board of Trade, which
was submitted" to the. board ' yesterday.
The document is voluminous, embracing
tables that fairly bristle with statistics
derived from various official and semi
official sources. There are no statistics
of home consumption, for these were i.et
available. â¢ , v
"The purpose," said. General Chipman,
"rather* is to - show the growth and pro
gress of certain branches of our agricul
tural industries as bringing wealth to the
State from without its borders and as a
direct reinforcement of our capital .en
gaged in these pursuits." -
These comparative facts stand out
prominently from the body of the report:
In* ten years- the shipments per annum to
the East, of fruits, wines, brandy and
vegetables have increased 50,602 carloads,
the total last year being 66,797 carloads.
Reckoning the ten-ton cars on which the
estimates are based and allowing . only
thirty feet to a car, it is seen that it
would take a train over 379 miles long, or
about j the -distance from Sacramento to
the ' head . of . the San Joaquin "Valley to
carry these products alone.
The horticultural industries of the State,
embracing the orchard, vineyard and gar
den, bring in more than - three times as
much money from without -the State than
is received for California's total exports
of cereals. Still, the output of cereals
has not been reduced materially, nor has
the production of wool. The mines reach
the annual output of more than $30,000,000.
The lumberman has found that the home
market. for packing boxes is worth more
to him than his entire export trade.' In
short, Â¦ fruit-growing has added a ' jiew
source of wealth to the State without in
terfering with any other industry.
Northern California last year shipped
80,799 carloads of green deciduous "fruits,
while Southern Â¦ California shipped only
nineteen carloads. On the other hand.
Southern California shipped 21,818 car
loads of citrus fruits aud,^Northern Cali
fornia sent out only 827 carloads.- â¢
"There went. from' the. north," reports
General . Chipman, "8490 carloads of dried
fruits and from Southern California 369;
of raisins there. went from the north 3421
carloads and from the south 161; of canned
fruits from the north 4563 carloads and
from the south 492. To. the shipments
from the. north should be added those by
sea from San Francisco,- amounting to
3284 carloads." The magnitude of the cit
rus industry in the south will be appre
ciated when it is observed that it amounts
to nearly as many, carloads as the nortn
sends out of green deciduous fruits, dried
fruits and rai/ins combined." v
The vegetiole industry of the north'sur
passed that- of - the. south last year, 2757
carloads . going from the north and 2053
from the south. The north shipped S187
carloads of wines and brandy to 176 from
the south. /'It -will. be seen," says. Gen
eral Chipman. "that, as except the citrus
fruits,' the orchards and vineyards of Cali
fornia are in 'Â¦ the north and " that nearlv
all the oranges and lemons 'Â¦ are in the
south." * . ,
Â¦ ; The shipments of green deciduous fruits
fell off- 576 carloads in 1900, while citrus
fruit shipments gained 9462 carloads; dried
fruits gained 312 carloads; canned fruits,
31 carloads; vegetables. ; 1736 carloads;
wines and brandy 353 carloads, and raisins
3 carloads. - There was.- a net gain "all
around of 11.315 carloads, cf which nearly
9000 were citrus, fruits. . â¢.
Many pages were devoted to miscellan
eous interesting facts. - -â¢ Attention was
called by Â¦ General Chipman . to - the fact
that the dairy output- was worth 55,000,000
more â¢ than all the wheat and- flour ex
ported : last year. It is . not , possible to
exaggerate the ; importance of the beet
sugar, industry to the State. General Chip
man says. .Of the "163.458.075 pounds of
sugar produced. in the United States last
year 86,741,713 'pounds were credited . to
California.:- Â¦ . ..â¢ â¢Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦-.

mlttee was adopted. These facts appear in the
records and. may be easily verified. Yet when
they were published Mr. McCarthy, who says
that he wants 'no assistance from the Labor
Council, made strenuous efforts to have a jglnt
.meeting of the representatives of both the
Building Trades and Labor" Councils for the
purpose of securing a denial. And to this end
his agents resorted to underhand work, which
has been denounced In bitter terms by members
of the Labor Council, whom he tried to in
veigle Into his trap. He caused notices of a
meeting to be sent out without authority from
the Labor Council, yet there were only two
representatives of the Labor Council present,
and to-day I am told they regret their partici
pation. After securing a certified copy of the
minutes he incorporated it in a letter to the
press and inserted this statement, which is ac
knowledged by the Labor Council to be false
and unfair:
â¢Every good union man in San Francisco and
in the State, no matter what his affiliations
may be. will do his duty by It (the Building
Tredes boycott) until Mr. Harris is out of the
baseball business."
The misleading character of that statement
is evident from the fact that the minutes of
the Labor Council, the only federation of or
ganized labor In this city, has decided to take
no action pending: a more definite request from
the v arnisbers' and Polishers' Union.
The Fri?nd of Labor.
From these facts I think it must be apparent
to any honest citizen that Mr. McCarthy has
been guilty of conduct unworthy a member of
a commission which is charged with the duty
of conscientiously putting into effect the civil
service laws of this city. He poses as. the
friend of laboring men, but while I have no de
sire to pose I wish to submit that as the pro
prietor of a union printing office, who granted
the nine r hour Fchedule one year In advance of
every union office in town, and whose . action
was recog-nized by election to honorary mem
bership In the Tynoaraplcal Union, per
haps. I have attested my friendship to the in
terests of labor and am in a position to ask
for treatment somewhat less rigorous than that
which the Muscovite ruler accords to his sub
jects. Respectfully, -
THEO.' F. BONNET,
Secretary California Baseball League.

to the President and his guests.
The President, has not fully, made up
his mind to accept or decline club cour
tesies 7 in Â¦Â¦' San Francisco. Senator Per
kins yesterday received a telegram from
"Washington relating to the Union League
Club's special; Invitation to the President,
but the message did not signify positive
acceptance. When the . President first
glanced over the list of city clubs, em
bracing the Pacific-Union, 'Bohemian,
University, Press, San Francisco, Union
I eague and Cosmos,' he indicated that
the acceptance of an invitation to one
club would imply an obligation to accept
the courtesies of other club institutions,
and he was then of the opinion that his
engagements would not allow him time
to visit all the clubs of San Francisco.
Since, then 'Â¦ he has . been urgently re
q uested to accord one evening to the
Union League and he may be constrained
to cancel some listed engagement and
accept the courtesies of the League.
The executive â¢committee of citizens ap
pointed to provide measures for Â¦ the re
ception and entertainment, of the Presi
dent in San Francisco held a session yes
terday and approved the following ad
dresses: â¢

FOR THE GRIP.
You Have Heard of Many Bemedies.
Did You Ever Try This OneP
Everybody you rrieer on the streets now-
adays either has just nad the grip, is com-
ing down with it or has r. sure cure for it.
The disease has been a puzzle to physi-
cians ever since its appearance several
years ago and It is as much of a puzzle
to-dav as it was then. It exhibits such a
variety- of symptoms in different individ-
uals and leaves such disastrous results
after apparent recoverv that as yet its
prevention and cure has baffled medietu
However, there is no doubt but that the
grip is catarrhal in character and the
leading symptom in noarly every case is
increased secretion in the head and throat;
in fact the first indications of la gripD3
are those of a cold in the head which ex-
tends to the throat and lungs.
Dr. Johnson Ames advises as the safese
course to pursue on the first appearance
of eriD' symptoms to keep to the house for
a day or two and take Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets every hour the first day and'every
two hours the following day. and states
that this will break up .the trouble before
it becomes deep seated. Â¦ ,
- These catarrh tablets are antlseDtiear.d
harmless and prevent lover and the fur-
ther development of grip germs and ward
off the ever present danger of pneumonia.
Dr Gerald, Simpson says: "I have
found Stuart's Catarrh Tablets a^jleasant
and thoroughly reliable remedy for the
grip, e&pecially with elderly people with
whom this prevailing disease is always
earigerous; the tablets can be found at
any drug store and if uled freely durin;
the first few days cf the attack will break
La : griope is a catarrhal aiJection.'the

ADVERTISEMENTS.Heretofore all such papers have had an evanescent
vogue and success. During the Civil War the New
York Daybook started out .to fiddle the same tune
weekly on one string and was soon fiddling a dirge
over its own grave, j Its editors, Hortbn and Van
Evrie, .were able and trained newspaper men, but
their readers got weary of the same old tnne. The
same fate was shared by the Demo Review, though it
was conducted* by Thomas Dunn English, author, of
"Ben Bolt," and other men of literary skill.
The readers of Mr.. Bryan's paper note the diffi
culty in assimilating what he writes, though when he
declaimed the same things they were relished as prc
digested food. In cold type there. is no eye in fine
frenzy rolling^ no tremolo stop to bring tears, no pre
arranged gestures that surround â¢ the' "peerless one"
with a glorious nimbus of outstretched arms and
quivering; fingers. In print all this is "dead beer,"
the froth is gone, the effervescence has ceased, and it'
is cold and tasteless slop. :

His readers will gladly welcome some advertise
ments in the Commoner, for they, may make the paper
more readable. So far its text has been made up of
a rehash of 'Mr. Bryan's too well known speeches,
and it is as lively as a dry hide hanging on a rail
fence. Â¦ . . .
As for the trust advertising, the business combination.*
as one reason for their organization quote the neces
sity for advertising enforced ' by competition, which
is done away with when competition disappears. So
Mr. Bryan might as well advertise himself by saying
that he will firmly refuse to swallow the Washington
monument, or stand on his head on its apex, as by
putting behind him Satan in the form of advertising
that is seldom offered.
7V/I R. BRYAN'S paper is out. soliciting business.
/ \ In the same issue he makes a bitter personal
attack on Mr. Cleveland and announces edi
torially that no trust can get an advertisement in his
columns at any price. He also declares himself dif
ferent from other newspaper 'proprietors because he
reserves the right to censor all advertising offered
and reject what he doesn't like. Here is Mr. Bryan's
usual pretense. All newspaper proprietors .do pre
cisely that thing. Â¦ >
THE COMMONER.
DISPATCHES from London state that King
Christian and the Crown Prince of Denmark,
who have been opposed to the sale of . the
Danish West Indies ro the United States, have now
changed their minds, and the King is reported to have
declared at a recent meeting ot his council that he
would no longer interpose any objection to the trans
fer, as he believes it will be to the advantage of the
islanders. The dispatch closed with the statement,
"The matter will now probably be settled quickly."
The prompt settlement of the negotiations by the
purchase of the islands is, however, by no means so
certain as the London experts suppose. It ' takes
more than King Christian to make a bargain of that
kind. There is a considerable number of Americans
who believe we have no need for the islands, since
the acquisition of Porto Rico gives us a coaling sta
tion and a base of naval supplies in that part of the
ocean. There are others who would willingly see the
islands pass under our control, but not on the terms
proposed. Those two classes of objectors have
strong representation in Congress and will have much
to say before the bargain is made.
It has been announced that the^ terms upon which
Denmark offers to .transfer the islands are these:
1. Four million dollars to be paid to Denmark. 2.
The. population to decide by vote whether to remain
Danish or to be transferred to America. 3. If the vote
is favorable to the United States than the inhabitants
to become immediately not only American subjects
but American citizens. 4. Products of the islands tc
be admitted to the United States free of duty.
Reports from Washington have disputed the accu
racy of that statement of terms. It has been said the
terms do not include a submission of the issue to the
vote of the people of the islands, nor a guarantee of
American citizenship to them in case of annexation
to the United States. The reports, however, while
den}-ing the accuracy of the statement of terms, do
not declare what t^rms have been offered, and it is
therefore fair to assume that the whole subject is still
vague and nothing definite has been proposed on
either side. .
The question of purchasing the islands has been be
fore this, country a longtime. : A plan for acquiring
them was put forward by Secretary Seward, but the
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which
Charles Sumner was then chairman, reported unani
mously against it. At that time the price -asked by
Denmark was $7,200,000. It will be seen that. the
terms now offered are much better than the old. The
islands have evidently been placed on the bargain
i counter, and by waiting a little we may perhaps get
' them at a further reduction in price in case we should
; deem it worth while to purchase them at all. â¢
It is now stated that the apparent" increase of 7,000.
coo inpopulation shown by the recent census of India
as> compared -with .that of a decade ag'o'is deceptive,
inasmuch as the population this year includes that of
several districts. that were not counted in the forms.

In all matters of this kind the first consideration is
money. Until ample funds have been assured it will
be impossible for the committee in charge to make
preparations of a definite nature. The money, there
fore, should be subscribed at once. It should be
given both liberally and promptly. It would not be
money wasted even if.it ivere to be. taken out of the
State, for there is no virtue that pays better than hos
pitality. However, it is not to be taken out of he
State. Every dollar subscribed is to be expended here,
and many more dollars besides.
California can afford to make something like a
record-breaking display of liberality this year, for the
people have been prosperous in all lines of trade,
and the prospects of the year promise an even
greater prosperity to come. It will be to our advan
tage to make the best possible impression upon these
visitors, for they will come from all the States of the
Union and from all countries. They will carry back
to their homes reports of what they have seen here,
and be among the best agents we could have in mak
ing known the advantages of .California as a place of
residence. Let us then give a hearty help to the local
members of the league in all their arrangements for
the convention and for the entertainment of their
visitors. Let us show that in matters of this kind all
Californisns stand together. Â¦ v- *-'
An item is going the rounds of the* press to the
effect that President Hadley of Yale favors the organi

wel? not to believe it loo fo'ndly, for it is only a little
â¢.vliile since he was reported to have . declared
there may be an emperor in the United States within
twenty-five years, and that report turned out to be a
yellow misrepresentation. . Â¦. . - ' .''
San Francisco is thus confronted by a duty of hos
pitality on a scale of great magnitude. It goes with
out kaying that her people will be equal to all the re
quirements of the occasion, and that the resident
members of the league will have the cordial co
operation of citizens of all classes and creeds in wel
coming their guest and making their stay both pleas
ant and profitable.
From the attendance noted at other international
conventions of the league it is assured that the num
ber who will take part in the convention here will be
very large. It will be, in fact, one of the most
notable gatherings of the summer in any part of the
world, and will attract the attention of millions of
persons in all civilized countries.
The league represents the creed and the work of
Methodism, and it is said that special personal invi
tations have been issued to upward of 20,000 ministers
of that faith in this country and in Canada. To the
members of the league generally there have been is
sued 100,000 copies of an official circular containing
information concerning the convention and the city.
Other circulars will of course follow the first, and
by means of them the interest of the members of the
league in the convention will be increased as the
time for the meeting approaches. â¢
r ;RQM any and every point of view the most im-
I portant event which can now be foreseen for
San Francisco during the coming summer will
be the gathering of the Epworlh League at its fifth
international convention. The league is one of the
largest and most influential bodies of its kind in the
world, and its conventions have been always largely
attended. Consequently we can ~ount upon having
as the guests of the city a numerous body of active
and progressive young men and women whose com
ing will be of as much benefit to us as to themselves.
THE EPWORTM CONVENTION.
Representative Hatch of Hornellsville introduced
into the New York Assembly a bill providing that
towns and cities might pass curfew ordinances re
quiring children to be. at home at a certain hour hi
the evening, but the committee to which it was re
ferred amended it so as to authorize Hornellsville to
prescribe the hour of night after which it shall be un
lawful for Hyatt C. Hatch to be on the streets or in
public places unless accompanied by parents or guar
dians, and in that form it was passed amid "up
roarious laughter." Truly legislative humor is very
funny. There are times when it is almost equal to
a vaudeville.
Some of the opponents of the policy adopted by
ihe powers in dealing with China are directing the
attention of the public to article 47 of the convention
'with respect to laws and customs of war on land,"
drawn up and agreed to by the famous peace confer
ence at The Hague. The article says: "Pillage is
absolutely prohibited." It is only fair to the powers
ic say they have always insisted they are not at war
with China, and consequently the action of, then
troops in looting the Chinese is not a violation' 6f The
ILigue agreement. .....;

POETSâ L. W., City. Poets are born,
not self-educated. There are many per
sons who write verses or lines that jin
gle, but that does not constitute poetry.
The lines that were submitted with thÂ«
letter of inquiry serve simply to show
that whoever wrote them is only wasting
time In a vain endeavor to writÂ© poetry.
MILITARY DUTYâ E., Alcatraz. City.
A man born in a foreign country, who be
fore leaving that country performs mili
tary duty, as required by its laws, then
comes to the United States and in time
becomes a citizen thereof, may at any
time return to his native country and not
fear molestation from the authorities. In
such a case the United States Government
will afford him the same protection that
it does to one of its citizens born on
United States soil.
DIVORCE IN HAWAIIâ L. W. H.,
California. The grounds for divorce in
the Hawaiian Islands are adultery, ex
treme cruelty, desertion, Chinese . lep
rosy and failure to provide. If a party
"has good grounds for a divorce in Cali
fornia, has not lived with the other party
for more than a year and neither party
had resided In the Hawaiian Islands, the
party who has grounds for a divorce"
could not go to Honolulu and commence
an action for divorce, for the law of tnat
country says: "No divorce shall dÂ»
granted for any cause if the parties to
'the action have not lived as man and
wife within the republic of Hawaii."
STRENGTH OF MAN-Subscriber, San
Jose, Cal. It Is not easy to assert posi
tively at what age a man is strongest.
Physical strength in man Increases up to
a certain age and then decreases. From
tests made of several thousands of the
male sex by means of a dynometer, or
strength measurer, the following is given
as the average of the white race: The
lifting power at 17 is 280 pounds, at 20 it
Increases to 320 pounds, at 30Jt reaches ita
height, 356 pounds. At the end of the thir
ty-first year strength commences to fall,
at 40 it has decreased eight pounds and
at 50 the lifting power is 330 pounds. From
then on the strength fahs until the weak
ness of old age is reached. Strength va
ries in different individuals of the same
age as a result of occupation.
VOTING QUALIFICATIONS-J. A. K..
City. The amendments to the constitu-
tlons of certain Southern States, while
they deprive some colored men of the
right tc vote by reason of not being pos
sessed of certain qualifications to entitle
them to the franchise, nave the same effect
on all residents of the State Irrespective
of color. The fif teeirth amendment to the
United States constitution, while it de
clares that no one shall be deprived of
volng "on account of race, color or previ
ous condition of servitude," does not take
away from the several Suites the right to
define the qualification of those who
would vote. In some of the States, to be
entitled to vote, the citizen must be able
to read and write. In California, for in
stance, a citizen who cannot read the con
stitution In the English language and
write his name Is not allowed to vote.

How to. Spend a Holiday.
How to spend the long and the short
holiday are often questions of vital mo
ment. Frequently the rest and change do
not result in good because the manner of
spending the vacation- is not well con
sidered. A man thoroughly tired out in
mind and body shculd not at once plunge
into .vigorous exercise. He should not
begin by climbing mountains and ford
ing streams, by indulging in long hours
of, bathing and. swimming, or by playing"
tennis and golf or *ther games to excess
in glare or heat. All these may be done
in good time, but he should allow him
self a period of transition In whi^h to
bask in the sunlight, and to breathe pure
air while resting and relaxing his mental
and physical machinery; later he may in
crease his physical output. Every real
dissipation should be avoided.
Much" might , be said here about camp
cure â about the rest and recuperation
which result from life in the woods and
mountains, by lake, stream, bay or sea.
To' many, such life brings health and re
stores energy v/hlch cannot be obtained
In any other way, and yet this mode of
life does not answer for all of those who
are advised or who are impelled to take
it/ In some cases it is necessary that one
should be more or less trained to if for
others it seems to be the natural method
of renewing strength and health; while
for still others more social and less
primitive l methods, such as abound in
healthful resorts, are to be preferred. For
almost all, however, the scent of the
woods or of the sea will do something to
strengthen or restore, if "only the method
of. securing the blessing is well considered.
One of the drawbacks is that which has
always been indicated when Â¦ speaking of
other methods of recreation in "connection
with the long vacation. Too deep a plunge
is taken at the start. If one untried in
the ruder and yet healthful forms of out
door'life will but take them up by easy
stages one may soon be able to get those
benefit? which come, more readily to an
other better fitted by nature and training.
Value of a Change of Climate.
The short hol'day of late winter or early
spring is usually best' spent by going to
some quiet but healthful resort in a
climate less taxing than that in which
the overweary man habitually dwells. The
springs of Virginia or-North Carolina, the
Southern seaside resorts, the Bermudas,
Nassau, Cuba or Jamaicaâ one or, another
of these places offers to most that which
is required. If a few weeks can be ob
tained a. delightful rest may be secured
by a trip to the Mediterranean resorts, al
though but few days of the time arc spent
on land. No effort should be made to see
sights or- to seek after those objects
which so often hurry and weary him who
is supposed to be seeking rest. Every
one must learn for himself what is best
to do through a study of his own neces
sities, aided perhaps by the advice and
experience of others who have found re
lief in rest and change. ".. Â¦" ;_â¢'_ .,
Climate plays an ' important â¢ part even
in the matter of short .holidays. Those
living in our Middle, New England, West
ern and Northwestern States who go to
the South or the Southern- Atlantic coast,
or ; to tho West ."India "- Islands, find that
they must perforce rest because of the
changed conditions. The higher temper
ature,-the balmy.- non-stimuiatlng- air, the
quiet. 1 peaceful life which prevails jit the
places most to be preferred, Â¦ put' the so
journer into a frame of mind and body
in,which nothing but rest is possible. He
has 'been told that he must not do any
thing that will cause him wear or worry,
and under the gentle and subduing- in
fluences of the new climate and now en
vironment he. finds that he couldnot do
anything that would wear or. worry him
if - he should tiy. ; I have been told by
more ihar. one that even the'merr- con
templation of the lazy and satisfied na
tives of siuch localities has Â¦ brought . a
sense of rest and peace to troubled soul
and body. .: â¢ '.' .-..-
Books That Afford Rest at Home.
' Often the problem Is how best , to rest
at home: in -the -evening or In the inter
vals of business. . One; not trained to hab
its of reading, so: much; a slave to work
and;care as never, to-havc taken time for
diversion . or ' amusement; ' is . often in this
r pÂ«mpct hfirirlicapr^fl "or'ously. ~T '..
Diseases of the Spring.
Chorea (St. Vitus' dance) is a disease of
the spring; at least many statistical stud
ies show, that the majority of ca3es occur
in the spring months. Cases of hysteria,
neurasthenia, melancholia and combina
tions of these disorders confront the
neurologist in large numbers as the wiq
ter declines or spring comes on. It is also
well known that many infectious and
toxic diseases abound or are more viru
lent, at the same season. Wearied with
his work, his vitality more or less sapped
by cold and exposure, his spirits dulled
and his system generally enervated by the
poorer hygiene of the indoor season, the
individual shows signs of exhaustion or
breakdown, or develops some definite dis
ease. If he would so arrange his affairs
as to allow for a "holiday of from one to
three weeks or more late in February or
early in March, and whenever possible
would take this in the most congenial cli
mate accessible, he would find that this
rest would do almost as much to maintain
his health and increase his stores of
energy as the longer rest of the summer
vacation. Unfortunately, it is just at
this season that work increases. The
student groans under his augmenting
load and waits with worry for examina
tion, while the professor approaches the
same period with almost equal anxiety.
Both are unduly worked when they are
least able, because of season and increas
ing strain, to endure their tasks. The
attomey and business man are in the full
flow of their busiest time.- Clergymen,
judges, physiciansâ men and women of di
verse vocations and avocationsâ at this
time are usually working at high tension.
A week or two of rest might save them,
and in many cases such rest could be ob
tained if provision were made before
hand.
! At least seven to nine hours- of sleep
should be had between sundown and 8
a. m. by those who expect to do good
work. In addition much in the way of
improving health, fitting for hard work
and prolonging life could be accomplished
by the - busy man by breaking the day
with a fchort rest.' This would best be
taken between, the hours of 12 and 2:30.
Half an hour would do; an hour is often
better. Even fifteen minutes taken reg
ularly will do something for the toiler.
If possible the rest should be taken in a
quiet corner or partially darkened room,
and should be m a reclining or recumbent
position. Even if one does not sleep at
this time one will find much benefit
simply by the perfect relaxation which
can be obtained in this way.
Business and professional men who are
hard worked through most of . the year
should have at least two periods of vaca
tion and rest. One of these should be at
tlw time chosen by the majority of per
sons â namely. In the summer months, and
probably best from the middle of June un
til the middle of September. .' If three
months cannot be had at this season, two
months should be taken, preferably July
and August; if only one month can be
had, August is to be perferred to July,
and in many cases it would be better to
take frcm the middle of August to the
middle of September rather than earlier,
in order that the worker may not come
back to his. work - in the city with the
hot weather still persisting, as* it not in
frequently does in some parts of our
country until the middle of September.
It is not necessary to go at length into a
discussion- of .the necessity of a summer
holiday. It is, only a question whether
or not the time can be taken. The same,
however, is not true of the other period
of rest, which is of the highest importance
to those who would do the best work.
Every observant physician and not a few
laymen are aware that a tendency to the
occurrence or recurrence of serious nerv
ous disorders is present in the late win
ter or early spring months, and Â£his Is
especially true If the winters have been
long or severe.
VTI.â RESTâ HOW TO GET IT.
may be, fatally. If he has been a reader,
let him turn again to reading for relief;
let him cultivate a taste for good litera
ture. A good book contains a wealth of
comfort. Books afford a method of brain
rest and recreation of which too little use
is made. The idea seems to be prevalent
that when the mind is weary and the body
weak recreation is best attained by abso
lute physical and mental fallowness, in
cluding the avoidance of all study, and
even reading. This is true to only a lim
ited degree; now and then we meet with
one who should indeed lift neither hand
nor. foot, should neither speak nor think,
or at least should come as near to this
negative, state as possible; but even In
such a case absolute physical and mental
inertia should not be much prolonged.
As regards reading, I have' found most
rest for myself and for thoae committed
to my care not in the rapidly thrown-oft
productions of the modern writer but In
the classical stories of all times. Seneca
on "Tranquillity" is as good a mental doso
for a tired multi-millionaire of to-day as
it was for Serenus in the days of Nero.
Defoe and Sterne, Goldsmith and Cole
ridge, Izaak Walton and Lamb, White of
Selborne and Thoreau will serve a better
purpose for the nervous invalid than
much of the output of the modern press.
The doctor need not always fear that he
will be insulting the intelligence of even
his wealthy and educated patients by sug
gesting classical writers; strange to say,
they are sometimes more familiar with
the modern romancer of uncertain merit;
or if perchance the classics are old-time
friends they will be returned to with re
newed pleasure under the stimulus of an
other's guidance. Not that all recent lit
erature should be disregarded, but a word
against the neglect of the classic and nor
mal in literature may well be said.
Games and Social Entertainments.
The extent to which one should resort
to games and social and other entertain
ments can be determined only by each one
studying his own conditions and limita
tions. Some men and women obtain great
relief and recreation from cards or chess,
or games like numero, halma and the like.
It needs only to be said that such games
should not be made a business but a pleas
ure. It is the change and the social in
tercourse which do the most good. Tho
tendency of some to resort to diversions
that call into play the same faculties re
quired at their daily work should be
avoided. A man who is compelled during
the day to concentrate his attention close
ly upon problems of finance, of law or of
medicine would better resort to euchre
or other easily played games of cards
than to whist or to chess. Long sticking
at the card table should be avoided, or the
attempt at diversion may be worse than
business itself. Concert and theater go
ing, public readings and lectures, and
even the tea, the reception and the ball
may play a useful part In resting from
business; but, unhappily, too often such
diversions take from, sleep and rest. The
claims made upon young men in t>asiness
and In professions by such diversions
sometimes add to their already heavy
loads rather than to clear their heads and
lighten their hands and feet for the work
of the next day.
A word might be said here of the spe
cial dangers which wait upon the scien
tific worker. He, like the business man
in some respects, although unlike him in
others, is in greatest danger from too In
tense ana prolonged work In a single di
rection. If he is not careful he will make
his life a terrible monotone. With hia
eyes fixed upon a single, and it may be
an important and noble object, he turns
neither to the right nor to the left, but
strives without resting day or night to
reach this goal. He Is often the object
of admiration, and sometimes of envy;
he accomplishes much, but sooner or later
he pays the penalty of his misdirected
zeal. Often a man of general capacity
and varied resources, spurred by his de
sire to achieve the high place in his chosen
vocation, gives up one after another every
means of amusement and diversion until
he finds that the summit of success which
he -as reached Is barren for him of every
thing that will give him personal comfort
and pleasure. He has done the great work
for others, but In doing it he finds him
self, when most in need of relief, isolated
ana often unhappy, plagued by the demon
of unrest.
About the Rest Cure.
It may be well to close this article with
a few words about the so-called rest
treatment or rest cure. Many mistaken
notions are afloat regarding this subject,
although the factors which make up this
treatment have become well known to
some members of the profession, and to
not a few in the community at large.
The mistakes generally have reference to
the manner in which the treatment is
carried out and to the range of its appli
cability. Some seem to think that all
that it is necessary to do is to put a pa
tient in bed In charge of a well paid nurse
and to give a few directions as to feed
ing and the use of medicines. But as
long ago emphasized by Dr. "Weir Mitch
ell, to whom we are indebted for the or
ganization of this therapeutic method its
successful use requires unusual skill a
special temperament on the part of the
physician and a thorough} knowledge of
the scientific principles on which it is
founded. Rest, physical and mental, is
the keynote of the treatment, but In or
der that this may be obtained with ben
efit other elements must enter. The pa
tient is not only put to bed, but he or
she must be excluded from family, friends
and business associates in order to secure
the most perfect mental repose; must be
given massage. Swedish movements and
electrical treatment, both for the sake of
the passive exercise -and for their espe
cial influence on digestion, circulation and
the nervous system, and must be fed by
a carefully regulated and increasing meth
od, in order to improve, impaired nutri
tion and supply the energy which hag
been lost through overwork or disease
Properly used, it may be a means of phys
ical salvation; but, on the other haiTO, i?
may not only fail of success, but, worse
than this, .it may do harm.
As summarized by the writer in an
other place, "this treatment Is most
valuable in neurasthenia and hysteria, but
it may be used with advantage in other
affections, as chorea, exophthalmic goitre
neuritis and myelitis, in some cases of
melancholia and mania, and even in loco
motor ataxia for the rciief of pain and to
improve the general nutrition. The opium
chloral, alcohol or other drug habit can
also sometimes be advuntageously treated
by this method."
Periods of Absolute Best.
In a few cases patients should be kenc
absolutely at rest for one. two or three
months; in other cast* a treatment by
partial rest in bed is more aoplicabk
Sometimes the period of absolute rest'
should be shortaned and should be applied
only. for. a week or two at the besinnin"
of the treatment. At times It is beat u^el
simply for tho purpose of preparing for
methods of systematized exercise or for
treatment by travel, camp cure or change
of climate. This is especially true In soniiÂ»
of the forms of real or threatened mental
disorder and particularly those in wh'ch
the patient has been rapidly worn out
through mental distre3s or excitement
The patient, in a worn, needs to be re
lieved for a time from sources of mental
irritation and his physical energies In i>art
restored before efforts are undertaken tr.
bring about a more complete cure bv
change of place and surroundings and bv
introduction to new features of Inter*-"'
into his life. It Is a not infrecuent cus
tom, for instance, of physicians who mtka
use of this method of treatment to flr*t
resort. to a full or narual rest trcatm"rt
in town; then to move the patient to the
seashore, the country or the mountains
and later to advise a. lonrrer nerio-i nf
travel with a carefully chosen companion
or 'attendant. .
Now and .then the physician finds it ai
most a3 difficult to stop 01 chance hii nro
gramme of rest indoors as it Is to besir
or. carry on the treatment. Reading con
versaticm and well ppJected diversions
have their part, in the sta^ of indoor
treatment and the moral Influence con

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
As the matter stands the public has had just*one
more illustration of the blundering methods of the
Phelan administration â one more evidence of its in
ability to carry on public affairs with success even
when supported by the people. ; The lessons of that
kind have been many and costly. The people will
doubtless profit by the experience. In the meantime
it suffices to say that San Francisco is bound to" ad
vance, and to make all improvements that are needed
for her welfare. Let us, then, accept the decision of
the Supreme Court as the law of the land should be
accepted, and proceed to comply with the instruc
tions given to guide us in any future efforts in the
way of issuing bonds.
The Supreme Court points out that the charter pro
vides a method whereby bonds may be issued for
public improvements. If the people wish to provide
for improvements in that way they have the right and
the power to do so. Since an overwhelming majority
voted for the bonds before it is but right and fair they
be given at as early, a date as possible the privilege
of voting upon the question again, and this time bet
ter counsels should prevail in providing for the elec
tion so that there will be no further waste of money.
There is no use crying over spilled milk. All the
money and work expended in. voting the bonds have
been wasted. Complaint might be justly made of the
city authorities ..whose ignorance of the law led to
holding an election whose results are invalid. How
ever, it is not worth while now to make even those
complaints. The evil has been done, and.it remains
to make the best of a bad situation.
In the feeling of disappointment that prevails there
will be among intelligent men no discontent with the
Supreme Court. The Justices are charged with the
solemn duty of upholding the law, and it would be a
sad thing for the State if there should ever be a body
of Supreme Justices willing to distort or ignore the
law for the sake of complying even with the popular
will. .We live under a government by law, and must
with good will submit when the law is seemingly
against us, for in no other way can we have well
ordered government at all.
SINCE so large a number of citizens of San Fran
cisco voted in favor of issuing ; bonds to pro
vide for the panhandle extension, sewers and
other public improvements, it is safe to say there is
widespread disappointment over the decision of the
Supreme Court declaring the issue of the bonds to be
invalid. The improvements so much desired and in
many cases so much needed cannot be made in the
way proposed. Either they must be paid for out of
current revenues or there must be a new election on

PERSONAL MENTION.
CARTER HARRISON has been for" the, third
time elected Mayor by the Democrats of Chi
cago, and, moreover,j the Democrats have suc
ceeded in electing Wells, th^ir candidate for .Mayor in
St. Louis, though that city is normally Republican
by a large majority. These two Democratic victories
in cities of the first class attention, for they
contain political lessone of no little value.
In the first place it is to be noted that in each case
it was a victory for conservative Democracy and not
for the Bryanites. In Chicago Altgeld and his fol
lowing made a bitter fight against Harrison both be
fore the nomination and after it. Two years ago Altgeld
ran as an independent candidate and polled upward
of 47,000 votes, but, failing to defeat Harrison in that
way, he advised his supporters this time to vote the
Republican ticket. It appears that his hostility helped
rather than -hurt the chances of the victor, for while
Harrison's plurality over his Republican competitor
is hardly more than half of what it was in 1899, stilt
his vote increased from 148,496 in that year to 156,952
this year. Altgeldism is therefore an utterly discred
ited factor in Chicago politics, and is hardly likely to
have any potency hereafter. ' â¢ <
In St. Louis much the same condition , of affairs ap
pears. The Democrats, in spite of the personal pro
tests of Bryan, nominated Rolla Wells, who has been
a consistent gold Democrat from the start. 'He sup
ported Bryan neither in 1896 nor in 1900. When he
was nominated Bryan fought him through the col
umns of the Commoner, and Altgeld went to St.
Louis and took the stump against him. His success,
therefore, is as strong a condemnation of Bryanism.
by the Democratic masses' of St. Louis as the victory,
for Carter in Chicago. :
From the two elections the country can draw some
thing of reason for the hope that the Bryan craze is
dying out in the ranks of the party that, so blindly
followed him in two campaigns. Even in the Demo
cratic camp it appears impossible to fool all the people
all the time. The nation is returning to a condition
of sane politics, and perhaps before the next Presi
dential, election we shall have got rid of Bryanism
altogether.
The failure of the Republicans in each" city seems
to have been the result of political blundering. In
Chicago the candidate, while personally unobjection
able, entered the campaign under the odium of having
been nominated by a boss whose methods have been
offensive to the better element of the party. Thus was
repeated, a lesson which Republicans ought by this
time to have learned thoroughly. The rank and file
of Democracy can be counted on to support a boss
named ticket, but in the Republican party there are
many men of independent minds who refuse to sup
port such nominations.' Consequently the appearance
of boss rule in a Republican convention is almost a
sure forerunner of Republican defeat.
The results of the two elections are therefore not
in any way ominous of a Democratic revival und;r
the leadership which has discredited it ever since
1896. In. fact the defeat of the Bryan and Altgeld
factions is an evidence that the people are over
whelmingly in favor of conservatism and good gov
ernment. Republicans have only to rid their party of
local bosses in order to assure victory lor their
tickets. '

STEAM vessels for Alaskan waters
are in demand. Quite a number of
steamships have gone into the
northern trade during the past
month and several more are to be
built. The Risdon Iron and Shipbuilding
Works has just completed one steamer,'
laid the keel of another and signed a con
tract to construct a third. The first ves-
Fel I*- for the salmon trade, the second
will be a steel trawler and the third is to
be a passenger boat for the Pacific Coast
Company.
The passenger steamer is to be modern
in every detail. She will be 205 feet long
over all and 194 feet 4 Inches between per
pendiculars, SI feet 3 inches beam and 16
fret deep. She will be fitted with triple
expansion engines, tht high pressure, in
termediate pressure ar.a low pressure cyl
inders being respectively 15% Inches, 26V4
inches and 43 inches, with a 33-Inch stroke.
She will have Scotch boilers and a forced
draught. This will be the first steamship
of any sire to be built by the Risdon at
Its new shipyards and no pains will be
spared in making her a success. The new
boat will be completed about January,
1902, and will go Into commission a month
later.
The Fteel trawler is being built for L.
D. Baker of Boston, the "banana king."
Cost does not figure in the building of the
pteamship, as Mr. Baker wants the best
end fartest vessel of her class. Her build
ers expect she will make fourteen knots
nn hour, but the contract only calls for
thirteen knots. The vessel will be called
the Kingfisher, and before leaving San
Francisco will be thoroughly equipped for
trawling for halibut. She will be the pio
l.eer steel trawler on this coast and is
expected to land her catch at Vancouver.
B. C. hours ahead of vessels now en
iratred In the business.
The Kingfisher will be 138 feet long over
all. 24 feet beam and 13 feet 5 inches deep.
There will be four bulkheads In the hull
and she will be fitted with triple expan
sion engines. The cylinders will be 14, 22
and 36 Inches, with a 24-inch stroke.
The new Ealmon steamship George F.
Hallcr was built and equipped entirely by
the Risdon works. On her trial trip last
Tuesday she averaeed 9.6 knots an hour,
or lialf a knot better than the contract
railed for. Managing Owner O. F. Haller
is well pleased with the performance of
his vessel and was delighted with the
noiseless manner in which the twin-screw
engines worked. While making 175 revo
lutions to the minute there was neither
r.o'.se r.or vibration in the engine-room.
Going at full speed a turn was made in
a 130-fcot radius with the port engine I
? topped.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
rneda is being overhauled and having her
ermines changed from compound to triple
fxpansion at the Risdon's new yards.
Two new 90-ton boilers and one 80-ton are
to be taken to the Potrero to be placed In
ihe steamship this week. They will be
Transported in a novel manner. Having a
large air space inside, which will make
them buoyant, they will be dropped Into
the bay and then be towed to the ship
yard and hoisted aboard the Alameda.
With her new boilers the horsepower of
the steamship will be more than doubled,
and great thines are expected from her
when she goes Into commission again.

The Standard . Oil Company refuses to
disclose anything definite, concerning the
prices at which the Kern River district
oil producers offered last week to supply
25,000 barrels or any part of 25,000 barrels
above 1000 barrels of their product. H. C.
Breeden, who had charge of the matter,
puts his refusal to give any definite facts
concerning the offers on the ground that
It would not be just to the producers.
The logic of this does not very clearly
appear, because the Information that he
withholds is Just that which all the oil
well men need. They want to know what
they have, to meet. Clearly it Is to the
Interest of* the Standard Oil Company to
keep them in the dark that their bidding
against one another may be as sharp as
possible. What Mr. Breeden said is of
interest to the producers for the infer
ences that may be drawn from it.
Can Handle More Oil.
"I think," said Mr. Breeden, "that the
offers made were such that we can take
much more than the 25,000 barrels that
were : called for and that the price Is
such that the oil can be sold In com
petition with coal. That is the competition
It must meet. Just now the competition
of oil is against oil. In the East the pro
ducers knpw all the time what price they
can get and we take all they have to sell
at that price. The rate is just as certain
as the price of wheat. That condition of
affairs does not yet exist in California.
When there is a fixed price It tends to
stability in the market."
But with this Mr. Breeden declined
absolutely to tjlve any definite facts con
cerning the large transaction of last
week: He said that the Standard Oil
Company was in the business to stay.
There was no more tankage* to be pro
vided at once by the company.
"Excitement over oil locations In the
vicinity of action," says the Los Angelei
Times, "continues." The Times says also:
No actual development work has yet been
done, everybody being apparently too busy
rr.aklng locations to do any other work. Sev
eral rigs have been engaged, however, for the
r.ew field and preparations are being made for
the commencement of drilling not later than
the end of Stay. Some options on the most
promising locations are reported to have been
given with the proviso that work must be be
gun before June 1. The options for purchase
of claims are said to be made for ?50 to ISO per
acre, with heavy forfeitures In case of failure
to comply with the conditions of sale. Nearly
fill the land lying between Newhall and Vin
cent and between Vincent and Big Rock Creek
is reported to have been filed upon. The dis
tance from Newhall to Vincent In an air line
is about fourteen miles, and from Vincent to
Big Rock Creek nine miles. In the vicinity
of Big Rock Creek the seepage is said to be
arphaltum, but around Vincent and Acton it
U paraffine.
) Water for Midway.
The BakersfleJd Californian reports that
the operations of Canfield & Chanslor may
result in furnishing a supply of water for
the Midway district. They are digging in
the upper end of the Santa Maria Valley,
back of McKittrick, from the lower end
of which is obtained the water furnished
that district. Five of these wells have
been sunk and a fine gravel has been
found capable of yielding apparently an
abundant amount of water. If it so turns
out that there is plenty of water to be
had a pumping plant will be rushed in
and pipes laid. The main pipe line will be
some twelve miles long, but the expense
of operating it will be inconsiderable, as
the point of delivery is much lower than
the site of the wells.
Kight hundred new wells, in round num
bers, are being drilled in the State.
The attention of oil men, according to
the Nordhoff Ojai. is now being attracted
to the valley of Ventura River. 'Inflam
mable gas and seepages are the indica
tions.
The Salinas Index reports that since the
recent strike at San Ardo, Monterey
County, real estate in that region has ad
vanced. Town lots have greatly enhanced
and the excitement is on.
Beating Out Coal.
In Los Angeles fuel oil is delivered to
consumers in large quantities at about 80
cents per barrel for the better oil. Says
the Los Angeles Times:
While it is true that certain grades of oil
can now be obtained for. less, yet it is im-
possible to contract for a really good article
for less than the price named. There are
various grades of coal, and there are also
grades of oil, but for all practical purposes
it can be safely estimated that four barrels of
fuel oil. â¢will displace one.ton of coal. On this
basis oil at 80 cents per, barrel is equivalent
to coal at ?3 20 per ton. As coal in this mar
ket sells from $7 to $10 per ton crude oil
need have little difficulty in successfully com
peting with its established rival.
An exchange says that in West Virginia the
Standard Oil Company (although working un
der the name of the South Penn Oil Company)
i=! experimenting with derricks made of steel.
They are eighty feet high, very light, and
eight of them are now in ' operation. Of
course, the idea is to get a derrick that will
be more lasting than the wooden ones, and
therefore more economical. Those now in
operation cost nearly four times as much as
wooden derricks, ' but ! the great loss from fire
will be precluded, and once built iron der
ricks will last Indefinitely. They can be taken
epart and shipped to a new location when
ever and wherever needed and those of wood

The Spokane Chronicle says:
Another oil district has been found that from
reports received promises to excel anything
yet located In this section of the country. On
Wild Rose prairie oil has been discovered that
can be taken up by the bucketful and the
scent of oil can be noticed for quite a dis
tance from the spring. The place on which
the strong-est Indications have been found Is
Owned by "Wilbur H. Lewis, and he has been
aware for some time past that there was
something the matter with . the water in a
spring on his farm, fifteen miles north of
Spokane. He attributed it. however, to the
presence of substances from the pine trees and
gave the matter but little thought till he
heard of the Rosalia finds. . He then bottled
some of the water from the spring and brought
it to the office of Garrett & Williams. The
water smelled so strongly of oil that the pro
moters were afraid it was a salted proposition
and sent J. A. Curry and Jacob Curry to look
over the land. They have been exploring 1 it
for about â¢ two weeks and report that they
hate found the crude petroleum oozing out of
the bottom of . the spring, and that the : mud
near the spring is saturated with It.

Governor Richard Tates is the son of
Richard Yates.'the war Governor of Illi-
nois.
Yates Is to Illinois what Roosevelt is to
the energetic, ambitious, progressive ele-
ment in the East. One of the most con-
vincing speakers in the West, he is a man
of great personal magnetism, as an inci-
dent during the President's inauguration
reception at the "White House showed. The
Hamilton Club of Chicago was received
by 'President McKinley in the east roomi
After the - introduction Bank Examiner
Lameon sang "Illinois," the last line
changed to "True to Tates and McKinley,
Illinois."
One source of Governor Tates' great
strength Â¦with all classes is his willingness
to recognize merit and to employ the best
means without fear or favor.
Needing, a spring remedy for himself,
and knowing Paine's celery compound by
reputation, and believing it to be the best
spring remedy obtainable, he used it with
such excellent results that he is willing to
add his -name to the many others
in responsible positions who have pub-
llcly Indorsed Paine's celery compound:
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 8, 190L
"Wells, Richardson & Co. â Gentlemen: I
have used Paine's celery compound and
find It an excellent remedy.
Very truly yours,
RICHARD TATES.
The more intelligent portion of every
community are the ones who best recom-
mend Paine's celery compound. They have
looked into this great remedy, followed its
remarkable achievements In the cases of
friends, neighbors and relatives, and know
just what to expect from Its use as a
nerve and brain etrengthener and re-
storer, and an ideal invlgorator for a run-
down system.
There is less hesitation nowadays among
well-informed people in attending to the
beginnings of poor health. It is well
known that disease Is progressive and
cumulative, easy to drive out at the start,
but a menace to life when allowed to en-
trench itself In any organ of the body.
If people would consider headaches, rheu-
matism, neuralgia, sleeplessness, indiges-
tion and languid feelings in their true
light and as seriously as they deserve to
be, and make a stand against them at
once by means it Paine's celery corn-

Any one who reads the heartfelt, em-
phatic letters that have appeared from
men and women who owe their health and
often their lives to Palne'a celery com-
pound will be impressed by the sincerity
In every line.
This great modern scientific lnvigorator
and health maker is doing: an enormous
amount of lasting good these spring days.
Its success in making people well has had
no parallel in the history of medicine. It
has cured thousands of cases of rheuma-
tism and neuralgia, many of long stand-
ing that have been despaired of by friends
and physicians.
Compared with other remedies, its per-
manent cures stand out as a mountain
does beside a mole hill. If all the men and
women who have got rid entirely of ner-
vous debility, threatened nervous exhaus-
tion, -sleeplessness and euch organic trou-
bles as kidney, liver and stomach diseases
by its help during the past year alone
could be brought together, what an army
of grateful people it would make!

NEW YORK. April 3.â To-day was a record
day in many particulars on the New York
Stock Exchange. The extent and variety of '
the price movement have rarely If ever been
equaled in a bull market, although ths crumb
ling of prices in a panic has occasionally 'Â¦
caused as wide variations. All ordinary btand- j
aids fail in the computation of such a mar- j
ket. The forces in operation were Titanic In j
their power and effect. The undevlatlng sue- !
cces of the speculative leaders in advancing !
prices made them bold to a degree which it is i
moderate to term recklessness. They bought '
with an unsparing hand through the stunning j
avalanche of offerings which was hurled upon 1
them on the advances and lavished the;r re- j
sources apparently with an abiding conviction 1
tl.at the astounding rise in prices, now so long !
continued, was destined to go indefinitely fur
ther. That the speculative spirit was still
rampant among a large circle of the public ]
vas obvious from the large and eager follow- j
ing which was attracted by any show of :
Ftrength at any point in the list. It cannot j
be said that news in the ordinary sense had 1
orythlng- to do with the extraordinary buoy
ancy of the market, although rumors were
plenty and all-embracing. It was also a
n-arked characteristic of the market that the ,
dealings were heavily predominant in a lim- !
ited number of stocks and that the general I
El-eculatlon was decisively influenced by the
movement of these. Two stocks stand out con
spicuous even in this list, the price movement
in which was astonishing throughout. These i
ore Delaware and Hudson and Rock Island. '
The former stock was the conspicuous leader
of the early rebound from the slight opening ;
depression. Rumors were circulated that a i
lease had been signed by which the New York
Central took control and guaranteed a dividend
of 7 per cent for a year and 8 per cent an
nually afterward. The stock was run up an i
extreme 13% points to 185%. Rock Island was !
under rather severe pressure at the opening j
and was forced 1% under last night. It was
not until late in the day that it assumed ths
ltadership of the market, when it was rushed
uf by rapid stages on the purchase of blocks
of thousands of shares to 151, at which point
it closed at an extreme rise from the lowest
of 13% points. The buying of the Grangers
seemed to be based largely on general con- I
sicierations. The movement resulted in an ex
treme advance of S% in Burlington, 6 In St.
Paul and Omaha, 5 in the preferred. 3% in
Northwestern. 4Â»i in the preferred, 2%. In St.
Paul and 3% In the preferred. The rise in
Lackawanna was obviously in sympathy with
that In Delaware and Hudson and extended to
C%. People's Gas became very buoyant at the
last and rose an extreme 4 3 i in sympathy with
Rock Island. Thei* wan an enormous amount
of profit taking during the day and only a few
Flocks escaped without serious Inroads upon
their best prices, the reaction extending to as
much as 5 in Delaware and Hudson and large
p mounts in other volatile stocks. This was
notably true of the steel stocks, which were
under pressure all day and were much less
actively traded in. The engagement of an ad- j
ditional $1,COO,CGO In gold for export was totally i
ifnored.
Dealings in bonds were large and the mar
ket irregular. Total sales, $3,635,000.
United States new 4s advanced U and the
old 4s coupon declined % per cent on the last
call. - 1

statistical position gives. 110 promise of a bull

showing a loss of 23 points on bid figures. The
rest of the list in the local metal market, how
ever, was without important, new feature or
even variation in price. Copper was about
unchanged in London ut Â£68 12s 6d for spot

was featureless and Lake Superior was nom

steady in tone with! trade dull : at old pricesâ

BOSTON. April 1 3.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter ,. to-morrow:, will say: -
The week JÂ«st passed has been remarkable,
rot only because of the large wool sales which
have been made, but . because these sales have
been made with no quotable effect upon the
price in either direction. There 'is felt to be
a certain amount of firmness, due to a refusal
on the part of the sellers to make any great
concession, but on- the other hand there Is
eoual determination on the part of buyers not
to pay any more for wool than they have been
giving for the past few weeks. -The bulk, of
the buying â¢ of ; the past week has come from
wonted mills, and they have confined them
selves pretty largely to fine and fine medium
Territory. Buyers have included such concerns
a& the American Woolen Company, which has
bf-ena large buyer. ' Arlington Mills, Pacific
Mills and the Wanskuku Company. They have
bought largely but. carefully, with an eye to
quality, as well as price. The sales for the
v.eek In Boston amounted to - 11,323.000 pounds
domestic arid , 160.0CO foreign, making a total
of ll,4S5,0C0 pounds, ; against a total of 6.997,000
for the previous week, and a total of 2,714.000
for - the corresponding week last year. Sales
since January 1 amount to 65,126,900 pounds,
against 43,729,000 for the corresponding - time
last year. ' _ . : . â¢ ' . . ,

Weathtr Report.
"With respect to the now enormous issues
of industrial stocks floating on the market
they differ very widely from the prospects of
the railroad investments. Some $2,i00,000,OO0 of
Bound and honest industrial investments which
have rarely seen the open market have been
suddenly converted Into $5,000,000,000 of issues,
the largrer t>art of which Is In common stock,
liable at any moment to be thrown upon the
market. The result of these conversions is to
put our industrial system largely upon a
speculative foundation. At the same time the
management of this vast amount of business
has been subjected to untried methods, about
the outcome of -which there can be no certain
oFtimate. The whole movement is a stupend
ous experiment, undertaken as much from
speculative impulses as from pound business
motives. And this immense volume of uncer
tain Issues is to find its market in Wall street.
The effect upon thÂ« f-teadier securities of the
railroads must at least be disturbing and the
morale of speculation can hardly fail to be
lowered." â¢Â¦-'-.-.:-
"If these are the conditions and movements
row existirp â and they not only are natural
to such a situation but also are already in
process of execution â it seems prudent for the
ordinary speculative fcclder of stocks to begin
to lessen his obligations and prepare for a
turn in the market. The market has unques
tionably some strong and eound factors in it,
and especially in the railroad list. For the
y<-ar 1300 the earnincr, both gross and net.
ere far beyond all precedent. Not a few roads
8i e beginning to pay dividends which have
never paid them before; the alliances between
groups of competing roads afford promise of
a ' large mitigation of rate-cutting; and It is
not unlikely that, after the subsidence of the
existing speculative excitement there may be
a resumption of those co-operative alliances.
All this warrants a higher normal level of
stock price* than has heretofore existed. But
these intrinsic improvements have already been
lairly discounted; the current average prices
of many Ktocks range above their dividend
paying value, . current or prospective, and a
readjustment of their values will sooner or
later be in order. - ,
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
'â¢As a rule the bankers and the great banks
are bocomirg cautious. It is safe to assume
tl.at this important class are already under
ocrr.niitments as largs as they care to carry.
They do not need to be' reminded that it is
reeÂ»'.ful to maintain a reserve of strength
egainst the rebound of the speculative boom
erang tl.'at may possibly appear sooner or later.
It is rather their policy to effect a liquidation
on their present advances than to encourage
new ones; and, of course, it may be expected
that they will aim to get out while cliques
snd outsiders are thinking it safe to hold on.
Another important foroe is co-operating with
the banking contingent. The multl-mlllionalre3
who have been the chief principals In the
great co-operative schemes understand that
current prices are llkoly to be the highest for
a long time to come for the Issues in which
they have become so largely interested; they
find the market flooded with largely over
valued stocks: the time for them to realize is
therefore while the market Is strong and ac
tive: and well-informed men do not need to
be told that they are pursuing that policy as
fast as thy can do so without breaking down
prices.

Mail reporie from New York tay: "Prunes
continue to sell well, and the market is firmer,
particularly on tO-COs. It is doubtful if that
size can be picked up njw under Â£%c. Stocks
of all sizes on the epot are reduced further,
there having been practically no arrivals this
week worth speaking of. The cut for expon
trade by the Cured Fruit Association to a Ic
basis, f. o. b., coast, has had no apparent
actual effect on the spot market other than
to cause a little uneasiness in some quarters

CLOSING,
NEW YORK, April 3.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The market for home stocks was dull here to
day. All the business that was done was re
stricted to American shares and West Africans,
which were extraordinarily buoyant. The tone
of all the rest of the market was heavy. The
American department was highly excited and
new high records were made in several issues,
the Eries, Northern Pacifies and Louisville and
Nashville". London was a large buyer of Louis
ville and New York supported this stock, also
Northern Pacific issues, which Berlin Joined
in the buying of, on the revival of the old
story that the Northern Pacific was to acquire
the Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul after all.
Tlie general list remained quiet, with Atchison
dragging. The bank has bought Â£20,000 in
Indian bars. Silver was flat and it looked
as if it might go lower, a' great many weak
holders having turned to realizing.

N EXT . Saturday evening, with the
first performance of "The Idol's
Eye" this season, a new bary
tone will make his appearance at
the Tivoli Opera-house in the per
son of Arthur Cunningham, who is cast
as Don Pablo Tobasco, the Cuban planter.
Mr. Cunningham will be remembered as
the Father O'Flynn in "Shamus O'Brien."
which was produced some years ago at the
Tivoli. .The said occasion was Mr. Cun
ningham's first appearance on the operatic
stage,, by the way, and he had the honor
of being chosen for his part by the com
poser of the opera. Dr. Stanford. ' . .
The 'Tivoli's latest acouisition received
his musical education in England and the
trend of his musical taste seemed at first
in the direction of , concert and^ oratorio
â¢work. .He sang in most of the large cities
of J-nsland in oratorio . and was thesolo
barytone for gome time in Holy -Trinity
Church, London. He afterward sarig the
name part of "Shamus O'Brien" in Ire-|
land and In the East.
After coming- to this country Mr. Cun
ningham joined the Castle Square com
pany in New York, playing- with them
such roles as the Escamillo in "Carmen,"
Mephistopheles in "Faust" and also lighter
parts, in all of which he was well heard.
He has also sung under the Hammerstein
direction, with De Wolf Hopper in "The
Charlatan,'.' with "The Runaway Girl"
company and. also with Lillian Russell in
"Erminie." The singer, besides his fire
voice, is a clever actor and has a pictur
esque physique and will doubtless prov-J
a valuable addition to the Tivoli forces.
"The Idol's Eye" will be given first on
Saturday evening next.
In consequence of the elaborate prepara
tions for the production of "The IdoVs
Eye" Saturday night there' will be no Sat
urday matinee of the week's bill, "The
Wedding Day."
The engagement of "The Little Minis
ter:' at the Columbia Theater will come to
a close Sunday night. Ntxt Monday even
ing comes Blanche Waish in a big scenic
production of Emile Bergerat's play of
"More Than Queen." As Josephine Miss
Walsh is said to be a brilliant success and
the 6inging of "More Than Queen" is said
to be elaborate in the extreme. All the
special scenery, ! costumes, furniture, dra
peries and other stage paraphernalia will
be brought here for the presentation.

WOMAN ATTACKS
A HOUSEBREAKER
Finds Him - Leaving Her
Home and Vainly Tries .
to Stop Him.
Mrs. Charles Benson Gives Battle to
Burglar Whom She Catches .
Ransacking Her Apart
ments. '
Mrs. Charles Benson, who conducts a
boarding-house at 217 Broadway, had an
exciting struggle with a burglar yester
day afternoon.
Shortly after 2 o'clock she saw a tall,
poorly clad individual leavirig the room
of one of her boarders. He carried under
his arm a portion of a blanket, which he
had stolen from the room. Mrs. Benson,
without waiting. to ask. him for an ex
planation, seized him* by the arm and
lustily shouted for help.
"With an oath the burglar hurled her to
one side and after aiming a vicious blow
at her head ran downstairs, pursued by
the plucky woman. After a short chase
she overtook him and grabbed him by
the coat collar. Again the fellow threw
her off and started down the street at
full speed.
Realizing the folly of further pursuit
Mrs. Benson returned to her house and
found that the burglar had entered the
room he was seen to leave by prying open
the door, presumably with a "jimmy."
He had cut a "blanket in two. evidently
intending to use the portion he took In
carrying- away any booty he might find.
Shortly after her struggle with the
housebreaker Mrs. Benson visited police
headquarters and gave a good description
of the fellow to Chief Sullivan.
During the past week a number of ar
ticles â¢ have been stolen from Mrs. Ben
son's house and she is inclined to believe
that the man with whom she had > the
struggle is responsible, for the thefts. .

GRASS VALLEY, April 3.â This section
of Nevada County was visited this even
ing betwen 6 and 7 o'clock by a heavy
thunderstorm, with an accompaniment of
lightning. Electric bolts toyed with the
wires of the electric light and telephone
companies and in the Grass Valley and
Nevada City offices of the Sunset Com
pany hundreds of fuses were burned out.
For about an hour telephonic communica
tion with Marys ville was cut off and' for
the same length of time the incandescent
lights here and in Nevada City burned so
dimly that kerosene lamps had to be
brought into play in business houses and
residences.
In Nevada City lightning struck a tree
100 feet in height. The tree was cut in
twain sixty feet from the ground and the
two halves folded like a pair of shears.
The branches of the top were embedded in
the ground several feet by the force of
the fall, with the result that the two sec
tions stand side by side, held together by
only a few splinters at the top.
Mr. and Mrs. Floyd," living in a house
100 yards from the tree, felt the force of
the shock. They were considerably
ehaken, but soon recovered fronf'. the ef
fects. A. R. Morris, who was passing
near the tree at the time the bolt de
scended, was hurled violently to the
ground and was for a time dazed and
helpless. Others in the vicinity had
similar experiences.
SANTA CRUZ, April 3.-Showers. fell

SAN JOSE, April 3.â The cold north
rain of yesterday and to-day, with the
frosty, mornings of. the past week, has
slightly affected the fruit crop, particu
larly apricots. In the Los Gatos section
the' yield will be light; in other parts of
the county from fair to heavy. The con
sensus of opinion among the orchardists
in town to-day is that the cold snap will
not do any material damage, the cropping 1
of fruit buds simply doing away with the
necessity of later thinning. Generally
speaking, the outlook for fruit in thÂ« val
ley this season was never more promising.

LIGHTNING'S JAR
XEW YORK, April 3.â Charles F. Jones,
who was the .valet-secretarv to William
Marsh Rice, the aged millionaire, whe,
according to Jones' confession yesterday,
was murdered by the use of chloroform in
â¢September last, finished his testimony to
day on direct examination in the proceed
ings before Justice Jerome charcing Al
bert T. Patrick with murder.
The story of the murder and conspiracy
which Jones outlined on Tuesday he to
day filled in with a wealth of detail and
with a coolness and nerve which, under
the circumstances, was almost overwhelm
ing.
According to the storv of the valet-sec
retary he and Patrick hp^d drawn up the
bogus will and were waiting with what
pa-tienco they could for old man Rice to
die, when a mill burned down in Texas.
Rice's connections there desired to rebuild
it and he spoke of advancing $100,000 or
$125,000 required to replace the burned
property.
"Patrick told me to use all my influence
with Rice," said Jones to-day, "not to re
build the mill, as ibis would take out all
the ready cash from the estate."
But Rice, insisted on advancing iho
money and authorized a draft for $25,00)
from one of his correspondents In Texas.
"Word of the draft arrived in New York on
Saturday and Jones, In accordance with
his compact, told Patrick about it. It waj
only $25,000, but, according to the valet,
Patrick felt that he could not spare eve:i
this much out of the millions that he was
already counting as his own.
Caution of the Conspirators.
"He then said," testified Jones "that lie
would have to do something to get Rice
out of the way before Monday, when the
craft would arrive."
Even more illustrative of the caution
and thoroughness of the plot conceived
end carried out by these men was.an
other instance related by Jones. The man
ager of Rice's estate in Texasâ a man
named Cohen â was in the habit of send
ing to Rice monthly a. check made out in
his name for his salary. Rice paid him by
signing tiie check and mailing it back to
him. When one of these checks came
along and after Rice had signed It and
given it to Jones to mail he turned It over
to Patrick in order that the latter misrht
practice on the signature.
The next check that came from Cohen
was signed with the forgery of Rice's
name and sent along In order, by Its pas
page through the banks of Texas, that
they might test the merit of their forgery.
The experiment was an entire success and
pave them great confidence in the greater
forgeries yet to come.
There was one point to-day at which it
was confidently expected that Jones
would give some sign of emotion. It was
oven anticipated that he might break
down. This was when he was asked
about the effort he had made at suicide in
the Tombs, but expectation was again
disappointed.
Valet's Extraordinary TJerve.
It was on cross-examination that Jones
really demonstrated that he was emotion
proof. Robert Moore ; went about the
cross-pxaminaiion In a spirit of thorough
ness that would have dismayed most men.
Gradually he lelt along the outlines of
Jones' story jntil he satisfled himself
there was nothing to be gained by a
3>aiierit sieee, and he attempted to storm
Jones' position. When he spoke of the
killing: of Rice he called it murder and
he kept the electric chair in the mind of
i he man on the witness stand, who
answered everything as calmly and quiet
ly as If the thing was merely a p^-func
lory rehearsal. It was impossible to
BbaJce i he testimony of the witness. Per
haps tli* only point where the attorney
for Patrick even appeared to shake the
nerve and confidence of Jones was when
they extorted a statement from him that
lie hoped by telling- his present story to es
cape the death penalty for murder.
Patrick's defense will be a general de
nial. It will not be revealed in detail un
til the actual murder trial takes place,
â¢which will probably not be until October
next. Jones, according- to the defense,
was the arch-conspirator, and Patrick
was only the innocent tool of the valet.
With Marvelous Coolness He Becites
Dread Details of the Plot to
Obtain the Aged Man's
Fortune.

J. H. Cordes, Stopped in Pursuit tt
Kitty Eisel, Uses Kevolver Fa
tally in a Pacific-street
Â¦ Determined to .kill a woman named
Kitty Eisel, with whom he had quarreled.
J. H. Cordes, a sailor of Alameda County,
used his revolver with terrible result in ;i
crowded saloon at 430 Pacific street early
this morning. '*~_
When the shooter's smoking revolver
was wrenched from him three men lay
on the floor, one dying, while two others
were wounded, one of them perhaps
fatally.
The. dying man was taken to the Har
bor Hospital, where he expired. His name
was John Carlson. The injured ones are
E. J. Shamley and Peter Sjogren. They
are at the Central Receiving Hospital.
The w"oman escaped uninjured.
Cordes and Kitty Eisel lived together
for seven years. Then they separated,
the woman going to the saloon where tho
tragedy happened. Cordes visited her last
night, and after a wordy dispute pulled,
hia revolver and tried to kill her.
The woman ran and the crowd of men
in the saloon tried to seize. Cordes. He
blindly^ fired six shots at them and nearly
every bullet took effect.
Cordes liyes on Snell avenue between
Haywards and San Leandro, where he
has a small farm.

. SLADKT THRASHED BY WIDMANN.â
Charles Sladky, Geary and Powell streets, for
mer proprietor of the Hammam Baths, secured
a warrant from Judge Conlan yesterday for
the arrest of Herman Widmann on the charge
of battery. He complained that Widmann
who had been annoying him, lately, met him
op Third street Tuesday and 'struck him sev
eral times, nnishlng up by threatening to kill
him. Â¦ :-::
Auditor , Wells yesterday compiled the
total of the estimates filed by the various
municipal departments for their expendi
tures during the next fiscal year, and as
a result he will recommend to the Board
of Supervisors a cut of approximately
$1,300,000 to bring the amount within the
revenue raised by the dollar limit' of tax
ation. The Auditor figures that the dif
ferent departments ask for $6,854,910,
whereas the estimated revenue will reach
a little more than $5,500,000. Of this $4,000,
000 will come from taxes, $900,000 from the
State for school purposes and about $600,
000 from licenses and sources other than
taxation.
"Wells has about decided to cut the es
timate of the Board of Public Works from
$1,288,538 to $983,538, a reduction of $300,000.
This will be $351,344 more than last year,
when it was $637,194. The Board of Educa
tion will have a large sum. sliced off its
estimate of $1,654,683, and other depart
ments will be reduced also, but not so
heavily as the boards named. This
course will be necessary in order that the
revenue may be sufficient to pay the ex
penses of the city government.

"Then if you held them to be false you
had a remedy by proceeding against me
for criminal, libel," said Philbrook. .
"I am fully aware that you have been
guilty of criminal libel," answered Judge
Beatty, '.'but I did. not care to proceed
against you. Cases of that kind- seldom
result in a conviction, no matter how pal
pable the guilt of the defendant may be."
Philbrook drifted to many lines and into
many stories, often told by him before, in
search of evidence 'supporting his charge
of conspiracy. He found none, but ex
pressed himself- as satisfied that the plain
ly stated contempt held for him by thft
witnesses of the day proved beyond thn
possibility . of a doubt that he was the
victim of a conspiracy by which these
witnesses, the defendant, his counsel and
associates and many Â¦ others had I accom
pllshed his ruin. -
"It is absolutely false," answered Judge
Beatty. "It is my custom to accord all
people such treatment as they deserve
without reference to the time or place.".
Dropping into still - another line, Phil
brook questioned Judge Beatty as to
whether : or not he had read published
statements made by him (Philbrook)
against the Chief Justice.. Justice Beatty
answered that he had read some, which
were uncalled for and malignant. .
"I cordially dislike you, Mr. Philbrook.
You cannot concede that any one can op
pose you without being a scoundrel. My
dislike for you is based on your constant
accusations against every one with. whom
you have come in contact. You have as
sailed the members of the Supreme bench,
you have assailed Judge Coffey, you have
assailed other Judges of this State and
many members of the bar, and lastly you
have threatened me. I have been inform
ed that you have accused me of persecut
ing you and have threatened that unless
I cease, such 'persecution' that something
serious would happen to me. I do. not
know what you meant by this threat and
I can now assure you that It is of the least
possible concern to me."
Pbilbrook forthwith took a new tack.
"Is it not true," said he, "that when we
have met in - company you treated me
in a smooth and suave manner and that
when we met alone you treated me with
extreme discourtesy?" -Â¦...' .
In answer to Philbrook's questions, Jus
tice Beatty said:
Cordially Disliked by Beatty.
r At this point Justice Henshaw was re
c.uested by counsel to tell in detail the
story of Philbrook's brutality to the Mc-
Gettigan child, but â¢ Philbrook strenu
ously objected. He had heard enough of
that story, he saidâ enough to establish
the feeling of the witness against him.
Justice Henshaw then left the stand and
Chief Justice Beatty was called. i
"An action will He,' it is true," an
swered Justice Henshaw, "but In this
case it is not a ready redress, because
people don't usually sne yelping curs for
libel." -',-Â¦â¢ v .
"I * have the utmost contempt for you,
Mr. .Philbrook," said Justice Henshaw.
"I have always regarded you and now
regard you as the most malignant and
evil-minded man that ever infested tue
earth. It is charitable to say that you
are insane. Your conduct toward and
treatment of those with whom you have
come in contact, your brutal abuse of
the McGettigan child, whom you cruelly
beat at Vallejo, and your brutality to
counsel who oppose you have made me
Extremely hostile toward you. " I inves
tigated your treatment of the McGetti
gan child for the purpose of determin
ing whether or not you were malignant
by nature or insane.- I have now reached
the conclusion that you are malignantly
insane." â¢ Â¦ . " '.,' ' â¢
"If my published attacks upon you have
been false they are libelous and you have
a ready redress in an action for libel,"
said Philbrook.
Contempt From Henshaw.
Justice Henshaw was next called, the
cross-examination of Judge Nusbaumer
being reserved until this morning. Jus
tice Henshaw, through the fact that fie
expressed himself plainly and in no gen
tle terms, " proved the most interesting
witness of the day. After leading the
witness through a labrynth of appar
ently immaterial preliminaries, . but
which, it was stated, had- a material
bearing on the "conspiracy," Philbrook
asked the Justice as to his opinion of
his (Philbrook's> personality. Justice
Henshaw then spoke without reserve.
Philbrook appeared gratified after he
had drawn this statement from the wit
ness and then he proceeded by asking
Judge Nusbaumer if it was not the state
ment made by Judge Paterson Â¦ that
caused him to make the allegations of in
sanity and incompetency against him in
the Merritt guardianship cases in Oak-'
land. Judge Nusbaumer admitted that
the statement might have had some slight
influence in that direction. "But," con
cluded Judge Nusbaumer, "my allegation
was based on. the gtneral opinion of the
bar and others. 'V . . -
"Judge Paterson,". "said Judge Nus
baumer, addressing Philbrook, "said that
you were crazy, that you were insane,
that you were 'nutty,' that you were oft
your base or something of that kind. I
cannot recall the exact words he used.
He said he had seen you walking along
the streets gazing up into the heavens
and talking incoherently. He â¢ said you
were crazy on fraud; that you always
considered any one who opposed you to
be a thief. He Baid that fraud was your
hobby; that you were a fanatic."
Paterson's Forcible Comments.
Horace Â¦ W. Philbrook began - yesterday
morning in his action against ex-Supreme
Court Justice Van R. Paterson the labor
of developing the facts of the "conspir
acy" against him, but the most material
advance he made during the day was to
reach a clearer, conclusion that not only
"Van R. Paterson but other equally prom
inent members of the bench and bar be
lieve him to be insane. \ This opinion was
expressed by Supreme Court Justice Fred
erick W. Henshaw, was reiterated by ex-
Judge Emil Nusbaumer . and was sug
gested by Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court W. H. Beatty.
Judge Nusbaumer was the first witnes3
called. After establishing the fact that
Nusbaumer was opposed to him in the
Merritt guardianship cases in Oakland
and that the witness had also made. the
allegation in. one of the pleadings of, the
case that he (Philbrook) was "insane and
irresponsible," Philbrook endeavored to
Â¦prove by the witness that he had reached
his conclusion through statements made
by Van R. Paterson. Judge Nusbaumer
at first declined to answer Phllbrook'a
questions as to any conversations he had
had with Judge Paterson -regarding the
sanity of the plaintiff on the ground that
such conversations were privileged, but at
the earnest request of Judge Paterson
and his counsel Nusbaumer finally re
peated the conversation. . "/

sensational developments of yes
terday aside from the fresh evidence of
forgery by Sullivan by which he obtained
the $600 put up by bunko men was the dis
covery that J. J. Groom, clerk of Depart
ment 3, over which Judge Fritz presides,
had received a Â§p0 fine money March 9 and
had made no return of it. Judge Fritz
promptly demanded of County Clerk
Deane that he transfer Groom and send
another clerk to his department.; Deane
promised* to do so,,. and he and. Groom
spent much of the evening attempting to
demonstrate that the failure to make Â¦ a
return of the money was due to careless
ness alone.
not- infallible, but a good clerk who pays
particular attention to his duties will do
his work without many errors. I regret

DENMAN'S SON
ASKS BIG FEE
Legal Advice for the Board
of Education Comes
Rather High.
?
The presentation of a demand for $1000 j
for legal services by Attorney "William
Denman, son of School Director Denman,
almost threw the members of the Board
of Education into a fit at yesterday's
meeting:. It had been frequently stated
that Denman Jr. did not want any, fee
for his labor in defending the two small
suits of Inspector of Repairs Wellin and
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury, but
would be satisfied with the advertisement
in connection with the cases. The board
was disinclined to pay Denman, but in
order not to be accused of hasty, action
took the matter under. advisement on mo
tion of the young attorney's .father.
The deadlock over the selection of a
principal for the Cooper Primary School
remained unbroken. Five more ballots
were taken, resulting in Mark and Cas
serly voting for Miss Nora Sullivan and
Kincaid and Denman for Miss Smith.
The school lot at Twentieth and Ken
tucky streets was ordered to be leased for
twenty years, and bids will be . invited
therefor.
Leaves of absence were granted to Miss
E. Levingston, W. T. Plunkett and Miss
Margaret Bailie.
Arthur O'Keefe and W. W. Bausman
were appointed census marshals. .
The communication from the civic sec
tion of the California Club, calling atten
tion to Its plan of forming a league of
good citizenship among the children of
the public schools and asking the board's
co-operation, was taken under advise
ment- . -
Superintendent "Webster filed his month
ly report of the condition of schools vis
ited by. his deputies. He requests the
board to act on a suggestion made in the
Douglass- Primary School as to the ad
visability of having a rule that all pupils
deeirhig to enter the receiving class later
than six weeks after the beginning oft the
term be excluded until next term. *
The Superintendent also reminded the
board that the streets in front of certain
schools. are extremely noisy, being paved
with cobbles. Webster suggested that
bitumen be substituted. . . . .
FIRST OF THREE
PILGRIM FEASTS
Jewish Passover to Be
Celebrated for Next
Seven Days.
SULLIVAN GETS BUNKO MEN'S BAIL
MONEY BY FORGING SIGNATURES
THE . SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 1901.

â¢ rt "''Â¦' " -
With sunset of last evening beean thÂ«
Jewish feast of the Passover, the flrsi
of the three great "Pilgrim feasts" of the
Jewish year. In the reformed congrega
tions It will end at sunset of Wednesday
next; in the orthodox congregations it wil!
last one day longer.
The feast of the Passover is agricul
tural .as- well as religious in character
and It is symbolical of -many things, but
principally of the - deliverance of the
Israelites from Egypt and of the â¢ death
of winter in the. birth. of spring.
As. a religious feast it especially em
phasizes the doctrine and principle ol
liberty, while commemorating the release
of the Israelites from - the bondage of
Egypt. In the orthodox congregations the
first two and last two' days are devoted
to services; In the reformed congregatlohs
the flrstand last days are so observed.
During the week Â¦ unleavened . bread .only
is eaten in lieu of other things made of
flour, and there are a great many rules
regarding the service of meals and the
preparation of the dishes. It is a time
of rejoicing and nothing in the services
or the observances are incompatible with
this character of the celebration.
Services commenced in all the syna
pogues last evening. They were short
and simple, however, and were in char
acter, preliminary to the more serious and
important services which will be held this
morning. At the - services of this-morn
ing the full ritual of the feast of the
Passover will' be gone through. It is an
elaborate and impressive ceremony. This
will end the first cervices for the reformed
oongregations, but in the orthodox ones
there will be similar services to-night and
to-morrow morning. Then' therÂ«'-will be
the usual Sabbath services on Saturday,
and on Tuesday evening and Wednesday
morning, the services of last evening and
this morning will be repeated. â¢ The . feast
â¢will end then 'for the reformed .congrega
tions and the orthodox congregations will
repeat the services again on Wednesday
evening and on Thursday morning, and at
sunset on Thursday the feast will end for
them. There will also be domestic ser
vices in: the 'houses, which are conducted
by the heads of families. Â¦ *Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦-':-.Â¦
In,- addition to its religious character,
the agricultural character of the feast is
typical of the opening "of spring. In
Biblical days there were certain feats
which it was necessary '. to observe ' by
making a- pUgrimage to Jerusalem and
there make certain offerings : appropriate
*o the time and season. The first of these
Â¦wbs the Passover.' held In 'the opening of
spring. "The -offering was a measure* of
parched corn. : The Hebrew records re
late" how- the '.Israelites, after leaving
Egypt, .^wttled; in a country where* they
lived off -thÂ«/"products of; the" soil. It was
In ~ the; "spring 'and the wheat -was just
ripening.;" and this --they parched and
ground and : made into unleavened bread.
This is why the. offering is a, measure of
parched com- s.nd that /only unleavened
bread ts eaten during the Passover. 'â¢Â¦-â¢Â¦Â¦
Pentecost *was the summer harvest feast
and lyplfied'tKe ripening of the wheat and
thÂ«" glories of .summer.- The offering at
Pentecost .'was; two "loaves of the finest
flour." . Â«$Â¦- â¢ ; . i , - â¢.â¢Â¦.-.Â¦
The feast of < the Tabernacles .' was the
third season feasts. It typified the*
autumn harvest of .fruit and T wine. The
offering was fruits <and -wines and oil." This
waE also â¢ the , feast E at which â¢ the"- tithes
were paid.- . Â¦"..* = \ ' --"-
All : these â¢ offerings i had to : be made iri
Jerusalem, and the . pilgrimages ;. made
necessary by, this law. 1 gave ..them the
name of; the- "rilgrinr!! feasts.. They are
all â¢ Important religious' feasts as ; well. , for
their harvest'- 'character - - has .â¢ - : become
wholly symbolical, and -has given place to
