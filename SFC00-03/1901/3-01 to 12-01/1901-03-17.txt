Carry a Gun
eSriHERE are only" two directions ia

( .,11 .be pointed; these are up, or down.
A shot fired in thV'arr can scarcely
injuro any "one or anything:, and one dis
charged Into the ground is equally harm
less.* 1 Therefore, In all the different posi
tion*'-which th?' grin assumes, see that It
is pointed either up or down. Sometimes
a man will be' seen who' carries his gun
reversed/ holding 'It by the muzzle whli*
the fore'end rests' on the shoulder and the
Â¦stock projects behind. Happily this prac
tice >fs -not common,' ; for It Â¦ is ' extremely
dangerous, -and 'many' men have be*a
killed by carrying their guns- In th!9,vray.
â¢If a man* stumbles' 6r\sfeps In a hole, or
catches his foot on a root and falls, his

happens to be walking by the side at the

Thus, stimulants, as^troyg coffee
or tea and alcoholic drinks, taking
food at bedtime, also mental excite
ment or strain during the day or in
the Junirs preceding bedtime, almost
invariably give rise to dreams nnd
predispose to nightmare." Sleeping
on a hard bed without being accus
tomed to it is very _ apt to cause
dreaming, owing. to , irritation of
the sense of touch from. undue presz]
sure upon the: skin of bony promin
ences. An uncomfortable or. wrong
position causes _ dreaming' from
straining of the newest' Sleeping
on the back often gives rise to
voluptuous dreams, for the heal in
the back causes congestion of the
spinal cord and thereby stimulates
the sexual nerves. Light, noises
and strong odors may* give rise to
dreams, as they set up a stimulus
in certain areas of the brain:'
A great excitement occurring
even early in the day, be itoftvoc
ful, ireful, gleeful, anxious,
dramatical, keenly hopeful or. pas

Is' portrayed : on the.stige by Bernhardt
and -Maude Adams. Attention was called
to'his^ death by' the following notice pub
lished? In a Chemnitz paper last Monday;
"At 6:45 o'clock there^dled. after a long
illness, my Â¦ Charles

Laxanburg, Austria, wh^rq', the Imperial
lover had established thom^ln a huntlns

charge^bf the King of gaxbriy,. who was
under obligations to Austria! The. mother
and son lived in luxury,'' but a few years
later., they_ were separated. -When the lad
grew'old enough to learn a trade be was
sent to Dresden and apprenticed , to a
tailor. A tailor he has been ever since,
though he discovered tha secret of his
birth and tried to gain recognition as the
descendant oCthe great Napoleon.
r In his possession were papers concern-
Ing his parents, and he traveled about
Europe trying to find his mother. HÂ»
learned that he had been baptized as Eu
'gene 'Joseph Napoleon In the Protestant
faith. The Countess Vllma was married
In 1S43 to Baron Ferdinand Hoicky, first
lieutenant In the Hungarian Mounted No
ble Guards. After three yean they were
divorced, and she died in 1559. T?ie son
had been know, under the name of Lud

of Bonaparte* although the police threat
ened to arrest him. He went to Vienna
to establish his claims, but when*- he
showed- his I papers they were taken from
him and he was escorted to the frontier
by the soldiery and told to get out. ' He
proceeded to Paris, where Napoleon Hi
'gave him presents and a pension, but
refused to recognize him as a Bonaparte.
In 1S72 he became a Catholic and aban
doned hla efforts to be recognized as &
member of the Imperial family. His
claims were* considered* so w*U founded
that Baron. Legoux, chairman of the

WILL PEOPLE LIVE LONGER IN
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY?
WHAT does the -nineteenth century
teach us in . regard" to â¢ human
longevity? This. interesting ques
tion was discussed '. at > a . recent
meeting of the Academy of Medicine in
Paris, the object being to <j ascertain
whether men are likely to live longer dur
ing the twentieth century than they, have
lived heretofore. .From statistics com
piled by Duvillard It appears that between
five and six years have, been -added to the
average age of man during the last cen
tury, beginning in- the year 17S9 and end-
Ins in the year ISM, and Dr. Vacber agrees
-with M. Bertlllon in fixing the average
longe\*ity during: the nineteenth century
Mt serenty-three years. . As the Bible fixes
the natural term of man's life at seventy
years, it will be Been from this that only
three years have been gained since the
tge.of Solomon, Some, however, main
tain' that the Biblical figures refer to the
average duration of life and not to aver
age longevity, which Is a very different
'thing,..
A certain fact is that more pereons have
lived to the age of. 73 years during the
nineteenth century than during j the pre^
ceoirg century. On the other hand", very
znasy families wer* less fortunate In this
respect flaring the last century than they
were during previous centuries. M. Gull
berf s researches showing that In these
partlcslar cases corn* persons during the
nineteenth, century died when 'they were;
ET &nd none lived to be more than TO,
whereas during the three preceding cen
turies the average age of members of
these famines was as high as 74 and 75
years.
According: to Dr. Vacher, fanners and
peasants live longer than other men. and
scientists are as likely to live to extreme
old age as todie in the nrime of life.
BIchot. Pascal and hundreds of other
learned men. he points out, died very
young, but, on the other hand, Fontenelle
Jived to be 100, Chevreul 103, Humboldt 90.
Newton So, Franklin Si and BufCon 81
years. I' v ---f f '-
Members of royal families. It is claimed,
have only a slight chance of living to old
age, statistics showing, for example, that
the average life of a Romanoff is 46 years!
On the whole, scientists and physicians
are of the opinion that men are likely to
live longer during the coming century
than.they have lived In the last, but they'
maintain. that, on a complex subject like
this no one can speak with much; aihhorr,'
ity and the-only guide is the. doctrine r of
probabilities.

TWENTY years ago Henry M. Stan
ley, who had reached Stanley Pool to
begin his ave years' work planting
stations on the river, launched the
first steamer on the waters of the Pool.
It was the little En Avant, of five tons
burden.' In the twenty years that have
since elapsed Europe has not failed in a
single year to send more steamers to ply
on the great African river. â¢ Â¦â¢ .;
There are to-day 103 steamboats travel
ins up and down the Upper Congo and its
tributaries, or preparing in the shipyards
at Stanley Pool for launching. The flotilla
has taken a prominent parfln the pacific
conquest and the economic expansion of
the new Congo country. It has been very
prominent in the work of exploration and

would. not have' been possible to start so
many tindinz and other stations. They
could not without the steamers procure
sufficient supplies. The steamers also
made It possible to deâ>lop the ivory ana
rubber trades,- which have now reached
large proportions.
Belgian enterprise has placed nearly half
of these vessels on the river. The fleet of
the Cdngo JFree State numbers twenty
nine vessel*, and Belgian trading com
panies, have nineteen steamers, making a
total of forty-eight vessels owned and con
trolled by Belgian enterprises, me most
important fleet after that of the Belgians
is the French flotilla. In the past two
years the French, have sent thirty-nine
boats to Brazzaville, on" Stanley Pool, and
most of them; have been launched. The
Dutcn traders own ten vessels, the Ger
many two,' and the English and American
missionary societies have four steamers in |
their service. . I

upper river. A very different chapter In
Congo history has been written in the
past, two years since the opening of the
r^.road from Matadi to Stanley **6ol.
Within the past twenty-four months naif
of the Upper Congo fleet of fifty vessels
have been carried on the cars to the
Pool. 7 While a month was required 'to
carry, the earlier boats over the moun
tains and down into the valleys alone the
235 miles between the lower Congo and
the Pool, an entire boat is now carrier!
over the route in two days. Thus the rail
road has facilitated placinp steamers on
the upper river, and now both : railroad
and steam vessels are working together in
the commercial expansion of the country.
It was a gigantic undertaking to trans
port the first fifty steamers to the upper
river. 'They "had to be carried piece by
piece on the backs of men. Not a few of
the larger vessels were divided Into more
than a'' thousand, manloads. and after
these ' myriad pieces were unloaded at

ties of salt yielded oy this region since
the Industry was tirst inaugurated, on:*
about ten acres of the immense depoMt
has yet been worked. This is accounted
for by the remarkable rapidity with
with a nÂ«w crutt forms as the work
proceeds, which enables the same Hni
ited area to be gone over continuously.
The drying and milling plant connected
with this industry are located at the vil
lage of Salton, immediately north of 'the
salt deposits and constitute an immense
structure COO feet In length. After the
salt has remained stacked in the field suf
ficiently long 'to allow the surplus moist
ure to drain therefrom it Is loaded on Hat
cans and hauled to the curing establish
ment. Here it is first elevated to the up
per portion of the plant, where it Is
emptied Into a bulkhead ' breaker, by
which the mass is reduced to uniform
particles, which are then run througn a
burr mill and thoroughly ground. The
product is next subjected to a bolting or
sifting process and after being put
through an aspirator, which removes all
foreign substances. Is packed into sacks
for shipment.
In addition 'to the better grades of salt

spersed with the long drawn shadows of
distant mountain steeps, are wrought Into
a picture of unutterable sublimity.
prepared after the foregoing method for
domestic uses, large quantities of the un
refined product, designated as "hide salt,"
are sold for mechanical and industrial
purpose?.
The working force employed In the
Salton district Is altogether made up of
Indians and Japanese, the conditions of
life in those brazen regions being such a.Â«
fio white' labor could oe induced to
espouse. The Japanese, who are greatly
in' the . minority, are employed only as
sack sewers, the mining and milling of
the salt being performed entirely by the
Indians. The. 'hardshipa endured year in
and year out by these denizens of the
desert are irnpoeslble. of adequate concep
tion. In addition 1 to the terrific heat.
which for weeks at a stretch reg'sters
an average of 140 degrees, the sun's rays
are reflected from/the scintillating salt
fields like the glare of a seething furnace.
So intolerable is this blinding effect that
even the Indians are forced to protect
their eyss with colored glasses in order
to withstand this ! fierce ordeal. And in
tho face of those superarduous conditions
the most acute trial of all is yet to bÂ«
enumeratedâ that of the torturing thirst
induced by the salt-laden atmosphere, and
which the wretched toilers seek in vain
to alleviate by quaffing the warm, brack
ish waters of the one solitary well the
region affords. However, the inexplicable
stoicism peculiar to -their race enables
the Indian salt workers to endure their
unenviable lot with x never a complaint,
and so leng as they receive the pittance
that constitutes their daily stipend they
are the personification of contentment.
Notwithstanding the forbidding condi
tions associated with the salt country,
there are occasions when the great deso
late region Is transformed, through the
agency of the desert mirage, into realms
of enchanting beauty. At one time the
vast glaring expanse will gradually be
come enveloped in a subtle, twilight haze
through which ever changing vistas coma
and go in kaleidoscopic array. One mo

vision of flowering elysian fields, which
an Instant later merge into the Vague
semblance of a wondrous city.' with splen
did palaces rlsins one beyond the oth*r
and troad, shadowy avenues stretchlnjj
away Into the Infinite.
But grander still are the effects when

THE present controversy between thÂ©
United States Government and thÂ«
I salt operators of the Southwest rel-
J^ atlve to the rights of the latter to
utilize certain unallotted mineral
lands is developing seme facts of singular
Interest concerning the particular region
Involved. Although the annual output of
eaJt in Southern California has for the
past sixteen years been enormous the
peculiar environments of the principal
sources whence the product is obtained
have resulted in cloihmg the subject with
comparative obscurity.
The location of thÂ« s e salt deposits Is In
the midst of what is known as the grert
Colorado desert, a thort distance to the
northward of the Mexican border. The
chief interest attaching to the salt pro
duced in this district lies in the unique
ness of its natural formation. While par
taking of all the realities of rock salt
eueh as Is derive] from subterranean
fources the Colored.-: desert deposit ex
ists in the form of a vast crystallized field
covering an area of n:ore than a thousand
acres and lying at a uepression of 264 feel
below the Bea level.
The surface of this immense saline
â¢waste 5s white as the driven snow, ar.l
from a distance un<lcr the influence of
the dazzling wmUcbit. it present* every
BppearancÂ« of a Know-less. fr;an:-strcwn
sea. The deposit, v.-.uch varies from one
to eight inches in '.Rkkr.ess. represents a
fclRh grade of r.r.tlv^ *a\t. slightly but im
perceptibly blended with carbonate or
soda. ThÂ» crust t>u* ennstituird is re
maik.-.Wy tenacious notwithstanding that
beneath it :irr nun â¢â¢â¢or* *a!t springs tc Â¦
which Us formation i* fine.
The greatest Interest that ha.* hitherio
attached to Â»his v.- s t Reid v.as in the
rpring of ISM. -vh.-u for several months
it became, together with thousands of
acres round about. trÂ«- Led of the famous
Salton Sea. Kor Â«=r>mÂ«> time 1t was the
general supposition that the groat inun
dation had proceed. -1. throuch subterran
ean passages, from ihe Pacfic Ocean, un
til the theory was dsssipatod by the dis
covery of an imnitv.Fc break in the Colo
rado River below the Mexican line;
through this outlet the waters had
streamed, clcavirg a chanr.el through th'j
desert sands to the crystal-covered region
beyond.
For seven years prk-r tr> the flooding
of* the district a company had been en
gaged !n taking out larjre quantities cf
the native salt f^r ph-n-nent througho r
the continent, and when finally the waters
tubrided the indurtry was resumed on i
yet larger scale than before. The plart
Introduced by the operators consisted
chiefly of a modern grinding mill together
Â¦with a steam dummy line connecting with
the Southern Pacific Railroad in liie
r^rth. By means of these facilities It fs
estimated that this one concern has an
nually shipped out an average of not Ie^s
than 200!) tors of salt, ranging in value
from f'J to $34 the ton. according to grade.
This lucrative, enterprise continued to
thrive wiihcut opposition until the latter
part of December last. Then the ITnlte.l
States Land Office suddenly turned its at
tention to the matter, and in view of the
fact that the land yielding the operator*
the most valuable supply of salt ha.l
never been allotted by the Government
straightway enjoined Â»he alleged tres
passers from further operations pending
an Investigation. The outcome of this
fingu'ar case If awaited with the keene t
interest, as. should th*Â» decision prove ail
verse to the salt company, the Southwest
would be temporarily deprived of one o'
Its most unique resources. This, how
ever, would be for a short time only, as
a K*>neral allotment of the lands would
necessarily socn be brought about, which
â¢would most profcnbly result <n the novel
diversion of a salt-scraping boom In thi
desert.
The methods employed In securing tne
salt in this district are singularly unique.
To begin with the surface crust is fir^t
broken by means of an Implement known
as a salt plow. This Implement Is a pon
derous four-wheel affair manned by a
crew of two Indians and propellel
through the agency of a steam dummy.
Its principal feature consists of a heavy
eteel breaker, which, as the machine ad
vances, cleaves a broad, shallow furrow
through the salt crust? laying up the frag
ments In parallel ridges on either hand.
Immediately beneath the surface there Is
Invariably a shallow seepage from tha
ealt springs. As the substance is broken
up it is taken in hand by more Indian.-?,
who work it with hoes to and fro in the
water until the earthen particles dJs
eolve, whereupon the mineral product Is
stacked In conical pyramids to await
transportation to the milL Ordinarily it
would seem, that the action of the watar
on the salt crystals must result in their
speedy dissolution, which result, how
ever. Is rendered impossible through tho
presence of the superabundant saline
properties with which the former element
Is already charged. So excessive are
these conditions and so essential the use
of water in the preliminary refining
process that the native springs have been
supplemented by the sinking: of an arte
eian well In the immediate vicinity. The
water of this well, though obtained at a
depth of 900 feet. Is intensely alkalin-.
Â¦which greatly facilitates the washing-out
process.

It might be well to mention incidentally,
however, that in reading the book aloud
the reader would better glance ahead or
he may find stumbling blocks which
would disappear In an expurgated edi
tion. Klizabeth is the pink of Innocence,
but her friends are of the worldly wise.
In her letters to her mother she writes
mucn. but understands little whereof she
gossips. She Ss evÂ«r the enfant terrible
of the house parties and constantly
stumbling on skeletons without recogniz
ing thc-m as scch, but revealing their
presence never theie*n surely, to the con
sternation and horror of the other guests.
Elizabeth's expressive descriptions are
not always elegant, but they certainly
carry a p:cturt-. Just after having caused
an outbreak she thus describes the partic
ipants:
Through her unconscious heroine, the
author gives many a sharp rap on uocial
customs and society â all In a humorous
way of course. As the letters cover Eng

The author Is evidently a close student
of human nature and her character draw

lent. Her descriptions at times are inimi
table. Here is a little of her jossip:
We meet Elizabeth first at Xaseby Hall,

unknowing In affairs cf the world, a child
in experience as well as in years, frank
in the " expression of her likes and dis
likes â altogether a very charming person.
but an uncertain quantity for the peace
of a drawing-room. Her Impressions of
society expressed through the epigram
matic medium of schoolgirl sentences give
the book a charm, greatly ennanced by
reading aloud. The matter is ephem
eral and you need some one to laugh
with you at the time of reading, rather
than to ta!k it over with after each has
read the book by his own solitary lamp.
A scheme worked out in this way. In
the form of letters, always has a certain
attractiveness about it. Under the guise
of absolutely frank confession on the
part of the character the author is af
forded excellent opportunities for Ingenu
ous s=al!lfE and is allowed liberties of style
which make easy writing, and in turn
easy readine.
TIIE Visits of Elizabeth." by Elinor
Glyn, promises to be one of the
books of the season. Elizabeth Is a
young English miss of 17. whose
"ancestors went back to the Conquest,"
and who "numbered at least two count
esses and a duchess among her relatives."
She has received the greater part of her
?education abroad on the Continent. Her
father is dead and her mother an Invalid.
At the time of the opening of the story,
Elizabeth begins to pay visits among her
kinsfolk and writes accounts of her ex
periences to her mother.
Hazeldene. goes to visit her relatives on
the Continent.
Here she writes a bit on French hom*
life and has a dash of yachting on the
Seine. The descriptions of the French
visits are very bright, very cleverâ and
frequently over the verge. The authoÂ«
evidently knows France and its language
Â¦well, as Is shown by the colloquial excel
lence of the Interpolated French. This
part of the book Is possibly rather more
"Frenchy" than is absolutely necessary,
but In these days, while it may cut it out
of the .approved list of Boston libraries,
still lr will not lose the author many
readers. True, any number of these same
readers will hold up their hands in war i
ing disapproval, but are sure to pass the
volume along to their "dear^ friend who
wishes to form her own opinion." At any
rate we must give Elinor Glyn the credit
of close Insight Into human foibles an<l
possessing the power of a forceful pen.,
One criticism will probably be made r*
'these letters, and not without some foun
dation, that is, that there are possibly
too many of them. Necessarily they art
rather similar, and while as bright . ai
they can be. still taken for steady diet,
they are apt to surfeit as too rich a des
sert would do. They should be read 'in
half-hour-a-day Installments.
There is no connected story told in them
â even Elizabeth does not seem to gro* 
mentally, but is as "green" at the end
as at the beginning. It Is hardly to bÂ«
expected that a girl will change much in
the limited space of four . monthsâ the
time covered by the correspondence, buÂ«
still traveling as much as she does, meet
ing so many different people and having
so many varied experiences, she cannot
fall to Imbibe a certain amount of world
ly wisdomâ sufficient, in fact, to give the
book a very satisfactory and pleasant
endingâ when she closes her visits j !:>
France and returns again to Englandâ

A Treasury of Irish Poetry.
Whether one is interested in the "Cei-
Uc" movement or notâ which same of lato
has been agitating many of the good gen
tlemen of Englandâ the true lover of goorl
verse cannot fail to appreciate a charm
ing anthology recently published by th<?
Macmillan Company. It is "A Tr-easu y
of Irish Poetry," edited by StopforJ
Brooke and T. W. Rolleston.
This Irish verse, written in English,
cannot occupy a lofty place possibly, but
It certainly appeals to the heart with the
true ring of sincerity. The editors are to
be complimented upon their selection,
showing variety and good taste. There
have been other collections of a similar
nature, but hardly any which can ap
proach this for completeness. The pres
ent volume brings the field quite up to
date. ?rv'
Ireland's poets are by no means un
known as singers of heart's songs as can
be recalled to the reader's memory bv
such names as Mangan, Davis, De Veres,
Drcnnan, Ferguson and the even more
familiar one of Moore. All of these arj
represented as well as some verses by
anonymous writers of scarcely less merit.
The editors have done their work most
thoroughly, not only. in the matter of se
lection or the poems themselves, but 111
the men chosen to write Introductions ex
planatory of the authors' lives, style and
works. ,
Mr. Brooke has written a comprehensive
preface, which adds not a little to the in
terest of the reader in the matter to fol
low. Speaking of the general plan car
ried out throughout the work, Mr. Brooke
says:
"The use of English by national poet?
and versifiers may be said to have begun
toward the end of the eighteenth century,*
it has continued ever since and this book
is a history and anthology of that poetr--.
We have cuvided it into six books,, repre
tenting en the whele distinct phases, buc
these divisions must not be too sharpiy
separated. They overlap one another an-t
there will sometimes arise, in the mid*f
of a new phase, a poet who will revert to
the types of the past or make a forecast
into the future. The short introduction
to these books discuss the characteristics
and the historical sequence of the generpl
movement . of Irish poetry during' _ the
nineteenth century.
"The arrangement of the selections i;>
theee six booKs illustrates that movement.
When the book was first projected I
wished to include nothing: in it v.nlch lid
not reach a relatively high standard c<"
excellence. Hut I soon discoveredâ ar..l
this was strongly urged by my brother
editorâ that the book on those lines wouli*
not at ail represent the growth or the hÂ«s
lory of Irish poetry in the English lan
guage.--Moreover, wur original purpose
had already been carried out by Mr.
Yeats in his too brief anthology, and H
was advisable that we should .idopt a dif
ferent aim. It must ulso be eald with
some sorrow that the Irish poetry of the
firtt sixty years of the last century wou-d
not rt-ach. except in a very few exam
ples, the requirements of a high standard
ot excellence. Art Is pleased with the
ballads, war songs, political and .humor
ous poetry, "and with the tsungs of lovo
and of peasant life, but she does not ad
mit them into her shrine. It lsÂ» only aulte
lately that modern Irish poetry can claim
to be fine art. But as it has now. in what
is called the Celtic Kevlvnl.vreacheJ thai

ceded it and examples from it , are of
value and of interest, at least to' Irish-

men. We laid aside then our original In
tention and our book is a systematic rec
ord of the best poems we can cull from
the writers of the nineteenth century. It
is also a history of the development of a
special national art and as such; has a
real place in the history of literature. The
modern, as well as the earlier forms of
that art, stand completely apart from the
English poetry of their time.: Moreover,
the book illustrates very vividly the hlÂ«
tory of Ireland and of her movement
toward a national existence."' .

A novel is announced as immediately
forthcoming from the press of the Henry
Altemus Company, Philadelphia, which
will particularly interest readers in Cali
fornia. In the first place the book is by
a well-known California writerâ George
Homer Meyer. I Mr. Meyer has long been
known on this coast as an entertaining
writer of fiction, especially short sketches
novel and striking, and also as a promi
nent member of the newspaper fraternity.
The interest in the book will He, however,
not only in the fact that "its author is a
Calif ornian. but in the story itself, which
is of local color. The title Is "The Nine
Swords of Morales"â a romance of old
Spanish days in California, the scene of
the story being laid in that portion of the
State now known as Sonoma County, at
the time when General M. G. Vallejo was
Military Governor of California. Mr.
Meyer passed the greater part of his boy
hood in Sonoma County and while there
absorbed the spirit of the old times of
Spanish Tiile and thoroughly studied the
romantic history of the p!ace.

McConnell's theory is that immortality is

cloth, lettered In silver and blue.
As a preface to the minute account of
events Which have taken place In the Isl
ands since the beginning of our war with
Spain, the volume embodies a history of
the islands from their discovery by Ma
gellan ud to that time.
Every exciting and dramatic Incident of
the war, such as Lieutenant Gillmore's
capture and captivity, Is admirably chron
icled and illustrated.
. The volume not only contains the ac
counts of every action written by such
trained war correspondents as Frank
Millet, William Dlnwlddie and John P.
Bass, but in addition embodies tn each
caÂ»e the commanding officer's account of
such action. In this way Admiral Dewcy.
General Merrltt, General Greene. General
Otis and General Lawton may all be con
sidered contributors to It, and the book
becomes In some sort an official publica
tion. <* -Â¦Â¦ :-"v.\
Bearing in mind the large share of th.3
burden which our volunteer troops have
<borne in the actions of the compalgn. the
publishers have endeavored to make the
book* absolutely complete In every detail
and have included in it rosters of volun
teer regiments (officers and men) that
have served in its battles.

made with hi3 "Children of the illst."
The sprlrg announcement from the Bos

of the leading i facials who have recently
come to public notice through the Boxer

had the remarkable opportunity to take a
photograph of the members of the for

in which the picture appears, the follow

More than one Instance !s en record of
ostriches being used in dace of saddi-s

A wealthy man of Vienna named Dollar
once built a carriage to which ho at
tached two bears, while a third was
trained to sit beside him on the box seat.
"With this extraordinary turnout Doller
appeared in the street9 of the Austrian
capital, but Â¦ complaints were soon madi
to the police that the bears scared horses
and provoked runaways. Dolier was for
bidden to drive his 'cam n the citv. Ha
then started a team cf trained wolves,
but again the police objected to his.dis
playing his eccentrlclMi'S hi the street*
of Vienna and he *ave up the attempt
to divert the public with strange turn
outs. '
But the palm "f *Â»ccerÂ»trfcUy in turnouts
must be given to an Englishman na.me-1
Huddy, who. when 97 years old. traveled
from Llsmore to Fennoy in an oyster tub
set on wheels drawn by a pig, a
badger, two cats "and a hedgehog. H9
wore -a high red cap on his head and car
ried a whip in one . hand and a tin horn
In the other.
A policeman kept the crowd back and
then stood chatting amiably with a
bright-faced, short-skirted miss. Here
was a. good-natured fight over some lady
and there a couple who had made too fre
quent visits to the bar did a Cakewalk.
The dance over, there was a wild scram
ble for chairs and tablesâ then more beer,
whisky or sherry, according to taste. v It
mattered not if there were not chair*
enough. "Fannie" obligingly held two or
three "fellers" on her knee, clasping th*
first with one arm and with the other
nand draining her beer.
Â¦ The scats next to me were taken by ft
decidedly pretty girl and her partner.
He had all the ear marks 'of the gutter
snipe. She was so fresh-faced, young and
innocent looking that I longed to reach
forth my hands and take her out of tha
wild surroundings. Eut I was not there
to do the "Gerry" act and so had to sit
and listen while she was tempted as havo
been all unprotected girls who have not
had wise heads to guide them.
He drew his arm closer about her waist
and took- her hand in his. The color in
her cheeks grew more crimson, her eyes
brightened and with a, poor, foolish flat
tered smile .she looked up into his face.
Her other hand twitched nervously, while
he continued his protestations' of love and
finally she caught her breath and dropped
her eyes. Â¦ Susie had surrendered.
"Say. hold the kid. will you? 1 * A young
woman stood in front of- a drunken man
with . a baby ' In her arms. Her partner
waited â¢Â¦ patiently . while she -handed thÂ»s
little, one to\ the man. The baby coood
and jabbered in toothless enjoyment of its
new r f ountf nurse.
The man hiccoughed In Â¦ its face while
he tried to dodge the infantile blows from
Us 'tiny: fist. It ' : was '.wonderf.nl, consider
ing. his state of intoxicatiom that he man
age'd^lo kecp'on his chair and I expected
. every mlnutn to see them both on the
, floor.
My anxiety was unnecessary, however.
Â¦ for the ways of a drunken man are be
yond the comprehension of tho sober. Tho
taby's mother whirled pas^t It. never giv
ing it a look, and after the dance was
over returned, much to my . relief . Mar
riage and babies do not interfere with the
Sunday dance.
There Is always a "feller" too drunk to
i dance who will held the baby.
â¢ â¢ Girls cf all ages were there, laughinp.
drinking, some clasping their partners
round the neckâ all were holding hands
and as it grew later more furious became
tie fun.
' The sun sank, darkness camÂ© creeping
on. The band struck up a medlÂ«y. faster
1 and faster it played, madder â¢ became- tha
danceâ their faces seemed scarlet blotches
whirling before my sight. Tbe> women's
voices grew shriller as they took up the
strains of a coon son?. Then the mu3lc
canged and with perspiring faces an.l
clammy hands, they made the final heat,
a mad rush once around the course â and
all was over.
Then they rushed out for the car*, push
ing, jostling, swearing, but very good
natured withal. The girls disheveled,
with dark rings under, their eyes, the boys
redolent of stale tobacco, whisky and beer
âthose who got seats slept heavily in each
other's arms, the majority who didn't
sang songs, jollied the conductor, talked
of their own affairs In the language of
the street. Such was their Sabbath, tho
day we are commended to keep holy.
All the churches and preaching In the
world won't chang^hem. Dig up their
ancestors, put them on the diet of cul

And as to your mother." I said with
apparent Irrelevance. "I should like to

.For in the day the house was In the

yards, thinking deeply, when I felt caught

turned me sharp round on -the path I

"Do you feel equal to coming Into the

together, and I opened the door and wo

goodness.
For my brother was walking up and
down with a kitten In his arms, listening
to Sarah.' who was reading aloud in that
delightful voice- which made It a treat
only to hear her speak,, and Mollle's hand
twitched? In -mine. I knew what she was
thinkingâ what did these kind souls know
of ; man's wickedness? The rector knew
himself. Sarah all men through him, and
I saw:the tears spring. to the girl's brave
eyes as the; sharp contrast of this scene
Â¦ with ; the i one , she had Just gone through
I camoL vividly: home to her.
Â¦ ."Mollie is allalone," I said, "and I have
brought her to spend the evening"â and as
Sarah was intent on the bookmark that

and ; my Â¦ brother was short-sighted, the
girl's pallor; her slight' disorder, passed

Â» her away < upstairs" to ; remove her hat.
But she was too plucky to let those
tears fall, though , I. saw her " hurt "was
very,; deep. For. she had genuinely liked
the man; , ho , had been to her all that â¢ ari

"Meanwhile I shall take you home to

Mollle put her soft cheek to nr.lne and
hugged me. and we went down together,
and more than once I saw her glance
wistfully around as if the cultured anJ
sympathetic surroundings brought all too
vividly before her the ghastly evening In
the little dark house, with only her moth"
er fast asleep for company.'
And I was glad to fee that Saran
warmed to the girl and mndc a perceptible
stride toward a greater Intimacy thnn had
formerly existed between them, for the

Often I had It in my mind to invad*
that cueer little hprtel and call for a
giass of mulberry wine, or raspberry vine
gar, or some such old-fashioned cordial,
but I pictured the aghast face of mine
host or hostess as a woman doing such
a thing, in such a place, and only idled
when I came near It, weaving strange
fancies about the place and forbearing to
tju^stion as to who dwelled within.
One r.utumn day I stood watching the
boys and girls who came pouring out of
the village schools at the top of the green
and betook themselves shouting to their
play; a flock of geese waddlod slowly to
ward the pool that lay on the other side
cf the road: the stones gleaming Â¦white
in the Gods Acre were divided but by a
low hedge from thope bounding, happy
youngsters. Away to the left rose the
gray c'd Suffolk church, its squat Ivied
tower rearing itself into the blue and daz
zling white cf the clear October sky. and
inevitably I thought of Frith** pictures.
The wScUeKl town seemed far away as 1
turned to care over the peaceful, old
world scene, at the var.derins village'
street in Â» hich no two houses were alike,
and yet human hearts were the same here
as in ether places, and pain came hither

Who could wonder, then, that she

"And you never loved blmâ not the least

circumstances, It would hava seemed to
me Btranse if she had not.
"What I likedâ or loved, if you like to
call It so," she. said bravely, "Is dead.
How could I love what caused me such
sickening fear, and what revolted me,"
and she shuddered with a sharp physical
memory as she crossed her own thres
hold and went straight to the matches.
When we had gone all over the tiny
place and seen that it was secure I kissert
and left her, waiting till the chain rattled
in the door and a light appeared in an up
per window. I felt easier now about the
girl, knowing that her best friend In the
matter was herself, but my anger rose
against the man. and I cast about in my
mind for the best chance of seeing him
alone and thrashing the matter out.
At breakfast next morning Sarah asked
me If I would execute a small commission
for her. and that I was to take a shawl
she had knitted to old bedridden Mother
Goodenough, who lived on the village
green at the Sign of the One-Pound-One.
Preoccupied as I was with Mollle's af
fairs. I took the shawl and went out with
it, walking mechanically toward the
green.
Suddenly Mollie's flgure came In sight
half way down the slope and as 3udder.lv
disappeared under the girfht trees that
sentineled the little hostel, and at tifl
same moment I paw Owen Stafford run
ning oulckly in the same direction and
vanishing at the precise point where Mol
lle had gone.
For a moment I stood confounded. It
looked so like an assignation, then some
Instinct told me they had both gone to the
One-Pound-One, the only hou^e behind
those trees, and I hurried swiftly up and
stood looking at the door of the ancient
place, which had so often exercised my
curiosity. .Â» Â¦
I heard voice? within, one raised In en
treaty was Owen Stafford's and without
a moment's hesitation I lifted the later*
of the door and walked In, finding myself
/in an humble, sanded room, that no
stretch of the wildest Imagination could
see fitted v.-Â»th a bar, while the owner ot
the place, whoever It might be. was
absent.
Bfollie was standing with her back to
me. Owen's face as I entered was grave,
earnest, yet ashamed, and wore the look
of a man pleading strenuously for himself,
trying, as many a one has done, to make
previous good conduct plead against one
moment of mad folly, and I knew by her
attitude that she was listening, that the
living eyes upon her were effacing the
memory of those others that had so ter
rified her. and that she was Infinitely
mere In danger of him now than she had
been then.
But that llghtnlnjf impression I had of
him before he realized my presence faded
as his glance met mine ar.d darkened, for
I was his enemy, and well he knew It.
Mollle, seeing that change in him.
turned and colored deeply, and T took her
gently by the shoulders and pushed her
toward the door.
"I came â I came." she faltered, "to brtns
Mother Goodenou^h some patchwork
pieces," and held out the Uttle bundle to
chow me.
"And I brought her * shawl from my
â¢tlcter-ln-law," I said, and shut the door
on her and turned to face Owen Stafford.
"Don't try to rub out the Impression you
cvide on her yesterday." I said contempt
uously, "for you never Trill. TVhy don't
you try your arts on . some one who can
atand up to you? A girl of twenty with
a criminally neglectful motherâ absolutely
alone In the bouse! You call yourself a
man?"
"She suits me," he said (a man always
tninks that a woman waa made to his
own especial order, till he happens to sÂ«-o

better, "and I love nÂ»r." be added. "I love

a free man I would make her my wl!>
to-morrow."
"No doubt," I said, "because the bo*t
order of woman always attracts the worst
order of man. She is dangerously attrac

"You are .very clever, very superior."*
he said, and I could not but admire th>Â»
way he kept his temper, but the worse i
man's morals as regards women, the betÂ«

the reverse in other order* of infamv.
"One would say." he paused ar.d bowed,
half-rcockingly, "that you speak from ex

"Possibly." I said indifferently. "If you
could flatter' yourself that you are an in

loved his daughter, who by special grace

He turned aside and stood looking out of
the casement, and in the pause came a
loud knocking from the stick of the old
bedridden woman overhead.
I went to the foot of the stnlrs and cried
out: "I Â«m coming. Mrs. Grodenough."*
and then I came back and waited.
"You hare* conquered." he Â«atd. but h*Â»

"I think our mothers ought to tell us."
she said presentlyâ "ought to open our
eyes for usâ gently, of course, for if we
do 'not learn by other people's experience
we are bound to do so by our own. and
then it comes awfully rough on a girl,
doesn't It?"
"Poor Mollieâ poor little child," I said,
my heart burning within me as I thought
of that poor fondy, her mother.
"What shall 1 do?" v,ent on the girl,
"for I can't tell her. She "would r.ot listen

"And I can do little to help you." I said.

in a twinkling. The springs were the old

of his back in; due time, ln the j...ci

table, but he felt that he had had ttie
worst of It. He therefore repressed his
first thought of calling the landlady up
and freeing his mind and In a few min
utes Â¦ had decided to at least pass tho

"Her own room, and she made a *rÂ»cr>
flce for me!" he groaned as he rolled inta
bed and the broken springs uttereu a
shriek and the corncobs commenced to
hustle around and get together.
For half an hour he lay and thought of
the box springs and hair mattresses of his
own bed, and the cuss words he uttered
could not have been heard by any one
listening outside the door. There was no
Mrs. Bowser, to bulldoze- and threaten
with divorce, no family cat to hold respon

Ing around and working the cobs out from
under his back and planning the surprise
party he would give the landlady in the

though still desperate, when a sudden bite
bounced him out of bed. Not for one in
stant did he ' imagine . that he had been
jabbed by a darning needle or a bradawl
carelessly left 'lying: about or that- some
body's pet dos had worked his way up
through the springs,' but to make sure he
lighted all the gas jets and turned the
sheets down.
â¢ "By thunder, but how dared she do It.
how dared she!" gasped Mr. Bowser as
he began to get Into his clothes. "I was
to tip her the wink for a fried egg, and

opened hl3 door and stepped out Into the

"And youâ you are kicking up a fuss

#^-r FTER passing the night at a hotel
f I Mr. Bowser arose with a new de
f I termination in his heart. For years
\. I and years he had contended that
JL the true way to live was to board.
On a hundred different occasions he had
declared to Mrs. Bowser that he did not
expect to know what home really was un
til he wae domiciled In a boarding-house.
Not an hour before ehe left on her Jour
ney he had rather exultantly Informed her
that he expected to P u * ln the happiest
four weeks of his married life during her
absence, not because of her absence, but
because he was going to board. Not only
consistency, but chagrin over his defeat,
demanded that he hunt up another place.
It did not take him half an hour to select
a house. He selected It on acco'unt of Its
exterior. A Kirl was sweeping off tlie
fteps, a Gog sat nt the door blinking In
the sunshine, and there was a homelike
look to things.
"Yes; we take boarders here," replied
the landlady as *he answered his ring.
"The house happens to be full Just now.
however, and 1 am sorry to say that It
may be a week before you can be accom
modated. Did you wleh to come at once?"
"Right away," he replied. "The sur
roundings are ho homelike and the atmos
phere of the house is so restful that I feel
ae if I couldn't get settled here too soon."
"Really?" said the landlady, with, a
bland smile. "I am sure I thank you, and
If you feel that way I shall have to make
an extra effort In your behalf. I could
give up my own room to you for a few
days and thus let yo*u come at once."
"But I. would not demand such a sacri
fice, ma'am."
"Yet I will make It for your sake., and
I won't charge you above the regular
the avÂ«H"hge nom# wasn't In it by compari

in the hall, and after receiving his en
thusiastic congratulations she timidly
said: v - â¢ â¢ 'Â¦'.Â¦Â¦ :}. ; -;Â¦"-â¢Â¦
'.'I might make an. exception In your
case-lf it is not -convenient for: you, but

"Why, certainly," he replied as he felt
for his wallet. ."I f ergot that part of the

It was not -until the next morning, when
the Bad Boy and the old man been
discharged with a reprimand, that the lat
ter noticed how his coat bulged in front.
and, examining the cause, fished out the
roll of bills he had wrested from the
croupier. T There was $1600 in the wad.
VI guess that's pretty near as much as
was coming to me, anyhow." he remarked
to the Bad Boy, "to say nothing of hav

"I think." said the Bad Boy adoringly,
"your next step will be to become the

you'd make J. Plerpont Morgan look like

been taken out of it."
GEORGE w.PECK.
HE THREW HIN\SELF OK THE CROUPIER WlTH A HOWL OF RAGE .
"Me?" queried the Old Groceryman. the
recollection of his carefuily planned ex
cuse rushing back to his mind. : . "Oh;;
came hero to look for my bid college
chum, Dick Croker. He and I used to
"What were you drAng here?" retorted
flie inspector, as hi3 men took charge of
the place.
"This here is a den of thieves, con
stable!" shouted Â«.he Old Man: "I wl^u
you'd arrest that young chao, the one
trying to crawl under the table, ik'i
be-?n robbing me." >_â¢'".
. He thre'.v himself on the crour>ier with
a how! of rage and wrenched from him
a big roll of bills that was about to bÂ«
transferred from the o.sh drawer to tilts'
satchel. The croupier grabbed for the
money, but the old man had already
stuffed it Into his pocket and was making
fcr the door, only to run Into the artn-s
of a police captain.
.The croupier at the table where the Old
Groceryman was playing grabbed up ; he
old man's winnings and started to throw
them with a lot of otne- chips into j a
satchel. The Old Groceryman, who had
no idea what all this excitement portend
ed, saw with dismay the vanishing of his
hard-won chips and fancied he was being
defrauded. : S
As the wheel started on its cishth spin
the doorkeeper hurried into the room and
called out something in an excited vole?
and the next Instant the room was a'.l
confusion. The patrons of the place bo*
ed for thÂ«> windows or crawled .under th-i
tables, while couplers began shovel!.:^
chips out of sight In hot haste,' while a
thunderous sound came from the outev
dour. " . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢ . â¢
At last order was restored and the gam-*
recommenced. The Old Grcceryman,
grown cautious, and fearful of maklr.r
some fresh break, put to worth of chips
on the red and left it there, simoly be
cause he was afraid of. breaking sor'r.e
new rule of the game ty telling it up,
There was a long run on rc-d and it "cam
up" seven times, with the result that $6-t>
worth of chips belonging to the Old Gro
ceryman soun stood banked up or that
color.
Before he <ou!d say nny more two stal
wart attendants had grabbed him. one by
each arm, and had him started for the
door at the rule of a mile a second, but
the Bad Boy interposed and explained
that the Old Groceryman had. acted
thrcusn ig-norance. and that as he had
more money with him than he could keep,
it might be weil to give him another
chance.
"I win! I win!" he shouted. "It's liko
borrowing money from rour wife's folks.
1 win S"CO. Whirl her again, my son!"
He picked up his whole $10 worth of
chips, placed them on No. 36. and then, as
the wheel began to turn more slowly, he
deftly caught the marble and dropped It
into the littie red niche marked 3S.
The OJu Groceryman watched the play
for a few moments, and noticed that
whenever the little marble fell Into a cer
tain numbered compartment of the wheel
the man who had that number covered re
ceived u pile of chips; and a brilliant idea
occurred to him.
The -Bad Bov winked at the croupier
over the Old Groccrynuin's shoulder and
passed over a $20 bill and asked for two
stacks of chins and placed one stack in
front of hfs 6*ld friend.
"Well." returned the Old Groceryman
meditatively. "I don't care how I spend
my money. Maybe you'd may. as well- give
jr.e as much 3.3 a dollar's worth to : start
on. and then J can cash in all I don't
use." Â¦ Vv/.'.v
them across to the pseuao niimonaare.
"How many -chips do you want?"
"I'll let you know when you reach it."
replied the croupier, gathering up about
$1000 worth of chips and preparing to push
"My. but this is real genteel." com
mented the Old Groceryman as the Bad
Boy led him to one of tne roulette tables.
"I 'expect to see a wild scene of strife and
maybe a murder or two. Say. young fel
ler." he called across to the croupier,
"what's the limit in this here game?
I'm a Western millionaire' and 1 don't
care how I spend my money. So I want
to know right now how much money I can
bet aJl at one time. What's the limit?"
He found himself in a long, well-lighteu
room, Â¦where perhaps twenty men were
quietly grouped abour tables, and where
no sound was heard save the whir-r-r of
the marble In the rouiette wheel and the
curt voice of the croux'ler announcing thrÂ»
result of each play. At one end of the
room was a sideboard, whereon stood
whisky decanters, glasses and cigars.
Just then the Bad Sjv sterped forward
and called the dootrkeeper by name and
xaid It was all right, and that the old
man had weird ideas cf humor and was
an ardent and alwav-> unsuccessful gam
bler; and then, on the introduction of
the Bad Boy. with wtiom the doorkeepar
was Intimately acquainted, the Old Gro
cerymap was admitted to the place.
"You'll chase yours:if downstairs an.l
back to Jersey, you measly old hayseed,"
retorted the voice, "or I'll come out there
and help you along."
"Is this here a haunt of Infamy known
as a gambling den?" asked the old man;
"because if It is, I'm Anthony Comstock
and I've come to br.Â»ak the bank. I've a.3
much as $1,00 ,0G0 with me and I don't
care how 1 spend it."-
A slit in the door marked "Letters"
was raised and a pair ['1 eyes scanned ibe
old man.
"Â¦\\ hat do you wan:?" asked a gruff
voice.
"When the man comc-s to the door." he
whispered, slipping !.a.t.ii out of the nar
row zone of Wght, "tell him vou're An
thony Comstock and that you've conn*
hexe in disguise because you heard it was
a gambling den."
"Move along," whispered the Old Gto
cei )man, reuaing the tt^n ovÂ«_-r the do-jr
"We ain't guins to no consu.idj.ied lea
party."
Eut the Bad Boy had rung the electric
bell beside the door.
They c.imbed a dark stairway and
stopped at last in front of a door over
wluci. hung a solitary electr.c light.
They turned out of Broadway into a
fide street, where they haltou at last be
fore the hallway of a small oflice build
ing. A tign on the vestibule wall read:
'Consolidated Tea Company, Second
Floor back."
"My!" he gasped, as he shamefacedly
thrust back the money into his pocket,
"you almost startled ine just at iirst.
I'll bet. now. you Ihotlght 1 was in earn
est when I pretended 1 thought you was
the poiice."
Once, as the Old Groceryman, In order
to avoid the light cast by one of Broad
way's electric signs, crept ahead of his
companion, the Bad Boy clapped him on
i he shoulder and asked in a gruff voice
where he thought he was going. The
old man jumped a foot, thrust a hand
ful of bills Into the Bad Boy's hands
and called him Mr. Devery and begged
h.m to let him go before he recognized
who his interrogator was.
he drew his hat down over his eyes,
wrapped his ccat about him as if it were
a tragedy king's cloak, and slunk m;-s
ter'ously along in the darkest corners,
giving every policeman they met a wide
berth.
"And what'H I need to pet me in?"
asked the Old Grocerjman.
"Only a wad of money, a comprehensive
Ignorance of horses ar.d an excuse."
"Aâ a what?" asked the old man.
"Why. an excuse, of course. You know
everybody's got to go to such places pre
pared with a castiron. full-measure ex
cuse that is warranted to wash and not
to fade in a strong light. Either got to
be there looking for a long lost son or a
Â¦wayward mother-in-law or something of
the sort that'll go down with the police."
"Let's fro to one of them poolrooms
right away:"' urged the Old Groceryman.
"I've got a* much as 52 I'm willing to
risk, and I'll make up an excuse as we
eo along."
The Bad Boy looked at his watch and
raid that it was too late and all the pool
rooms would be closed at such an hour,
but that they'd be sure to rind a roulette
wheel spinning somewhere or other and
they might try u whirl at that if the old
man chose; and then he went on to ex
plain roulette and to awaken in his old
friend a wild desire to tempt fortua*; at
the wheel.
"You say you get as much money as
you give the man if the right color hap
per.s. and that you get thirty-five times as
much if you bet on a number and the
number comes out the way it ought to!"
cried the Old Grcceryman. "Why, It's
a reai shame to take the poor folks'
money like that, ain't it? It seems 'most
too easy."
"Oh, they're a generous, big-hearted
lot, the men who run these places,'' re
plied the Bad Boy. "They try to make
everybody rich and happy."
"They do, I guess," agreed the Old Gro
ceryrr.an, "and it's a shame- for the police
to bother such good men."
"It is. indeed!" exclaimed the Bad Boy,
"especially when they're so generous as
to give the poor police money, too. Shall
w start around there now?"
They sallied forth on Broadway, and
there the Bad Boy found considerable
amusement in watching the Old Grocery,
man. who was 60 full of the idea that he
was about to do something illegal that
TliE Old Groceryman was growing
restive once more, and the Bad
Boy saw that all the recent adven
tures had failed to quell that great
spirit ar.tf realized tt was up to him
to introduce his old Iriend to still another
phase of New York life.
While the Uad Boy was casting about
in his mind for some new diversion the
Old Groceryman himself solved the prob
lem by asking one evening:
"What's all this I read about raiding
poolrooms?"
"What!" exclaimed the Bad Boy. "Do
you mean to say you've never been in a
l>oolroom?"
"Never." admitted the old man. and he
looked npolosetlc as he added, "Never
touched a cue in my life."
With infinite patience the Bad Boy ex
plained the nature of a poolroom and the
business conducted there, which only
served to awaken in the Old Groceryman
the love of gambling that is innate in
every human breast.
"Well, I'll be teetotally blest!" ex
claimed the old man. "If that isn't the
easiest way of making money I ever
heard of. I won $1 95 betting against
Hancock the time Garrieid got elected, but
I never heard of putting up a dollar and
muyl>e getting fifty beck again. Say , boy.
do you know where any of theai pool
rooms are?"
"Lots of them," the Bad Boy assured
him.

brakes. .
If ( you have ever visited the Washing
ton tank you .'will â¢_' no doubt have noticed
how: elaborate -these, provisions are..: The
tank there Is, however, longer than ours
and theactual speeds they run are higher.
The tank data is converted into ships*
data by. use of , Froude's law. This law.
briefly stated. Is; that; the -wave making
resistance of model and 6hip are propor
tional to their displacement at correspond
ing speeds.'., Corresponding, speeds. are as
the-root of the lengths; .that is : to ; say,
if you had a model. *-0- feet -long and a
ship 400 feet long, ' and you wished
ship to run. at twenty knots, the model
; would be reaulred to-be run; In the tank
at ten knots. !
,As one of ; the firm said: "All the work
involved in the building of a ship Is done
inside our gates. We have departments
for copper work, plumber, .work, uphol
stery work, painting,' decorating and elec
tric light,": which in Imany establishments
are let out to sub-contractors."
Perhaps the : Denny : annual tonnageâ
which varies considerably In all yards
may not ;be the highest; on, the Clyde, but
the class of vessel ; is ; as a; rule high, and
probably ; the value of the work turned
out : is of the ; first- rank. . Twenty years
ago the number of -vessels the firm had
built .. was . 243, but to-day ;â¢ it totals * up ; to
654, . making 411" vessels â¢ turned . out , in ; that
time, or - an average j of twenty per an

Perhaps one of! the. most interesting of
the many remarkable and striking In
stances of enterprise and the spending of
money where;. money- Is needed on the.
part of s the firm in what Is known as. the'
"experimental tank." t This highly prac
tical feature of the yard was constructed
in 18S2. and has cost roughly,, from first
to last. Â£20,000.'; It costs from Â£3000 to
Â£4000 a year to run it. Â» For the first : five
yenrs the nrm: practically got no working
Information from It.' '.These years were'
taken up in experiments with -a series of
muileln to get-reliable data to work .from,
as th'ere was none other available, and
also In trying a large number of -vessels
in the ; tank for whjch it had data on
measured . mile .trials." Without
past"; experience of the relation >between
the tank horsepower : and the measured
mile ' horsepower," there 'was no possibility
of using the tank ''efficiently.; and the cap
ital sunk, was therefore: large. . But. the
firm is now satisfied that It was a wise

With-thls Is nublished a panoramic view
of the shipbuilding-yard, which will /give
an idea of ; the vastness of the business
of Denny Brothers.; Far, away to the left
may be seen ft 'slip. That Is attached to
the engineering; works, whence may be
seen coming^ out a curious looking, rud
derless, double" i* funneled, self-steering
craft, bringing boilers across, from Â¦ there
to the slip, where'the huge crane Is to
be seen and which with ease lifts 'the
largest boilers and deposits them in place
in the ships moored up along the wharf."
That curlcus self-steering craft which is
carrying over the boiler is an invention of
one; of the workmen -in the engineering
firm. It is one of the .principles In this
vast business, where so: many' highly in
telligent artisans are employed, to en
courage in every way the. individual In
ventive faculties of the employes. In this
manner the Denny firm ; has -become pos
sessed of large numbers of highly useful,
practical Inventions, which have been
thought out by their. artisans, some small,
but others very important. :'. For. such in
ventions i the workmen are pa id > accord Ing
to the value of their particular Invention.
While on the' subject of the workman. It
is interesting to know,: that: the Denny
firms believe ... most " thoroughly .' liT looking
after their men. Most; of their; artisans
arc encouraged in every way to own 'their
ever built. My attention was called to tfe
shed whence that yacht was launched.
Well, under that same shed Sir Thomas
l.ipton's new challenger Is belns buIU.
Krrie tales tome up of how she is being
built, tnat. the. workmen only come on at
night and are bound to secrecy, not even
nliov.ea to consort with their fellow men.
That is all very exaggerated.
That secrecy is observed is. however.
Without any kind of doubt. Nut because
Mcfsrs. "â¢ Denny seek it. but special orders
ti tl:Ut effect have been given by Sir
Thomas Lipton, Â¦ who has said; that thi3
time n-.ore than ever will the mystery of
the build cf his challenging yacht be con
cealed.*. .Why, some people cannot under
stand.-
But the other day a friend of Sir Thom
os, who .'pretended to know the feelings
th"Â« actuated the genial knight, explained
it by saying that Sir Thomas was a great
judse of 'humiin nature, and that he was
perfectly aware that the more- mystery
there: was attached to anything the more
the Interest the public would . feel , in it.
And -that. 'is why he Is thoroughly deter
mh:ed to keep people wondering up to the
very last moment.
What I can tell you about the' yacht Is
small. /Oennys don't breathe , a. word
about n. V. All that the visitor sees Is the
shed from which you see the yacht being
launched, in the accompanying picture.
Butâ and it is a big butâ the shed is not
exactly the same as it appears in the pic
ture. Since the newÂ° challenger has been
laid down that shed has been must care
fully boarded in. from roof to ground, and
no one coming without special permit is
allowed to go j Inside the entrance doors.
In order that necessary, light may be had,
great big, windows have been cut In the
roof of. the shed. I
The men work; Just In the usual manner

they are working hard. . ; ; V./.

a half acres are roofed ; in for . this pur
pose arid f.there:* all 'the .newest ma
chinery is; to" fce. found for ; every , purpose

:;The^engineering; department is a really
wonderful institution to visit. There you
can see at one time what may be called
the vitals of ; entire ships, standing up
completed -and ready to, be, placed as soon
as the' hulls are in a condition to receive
them. It strikes one almost with awe to
see such vast and complicated machinery
attached "and adjusted with all the accu
racy of clockwork. It 'is, there that In
brief space. Jf you have the luck to have
one of the Denny brothers with youâ as
I hadâ you will' learn more about engines
and furnaces and boilers than you have
known in all your life before. It is an
engineer's paradise. " All about are the
most modern machines for riveting, which
have so lightened what used to be such a
laborious task when done by hand alone.
In the shipbuilding yard, and. by tha
way, no photographer and camera have
recently been allowed * In here, you
will see ships Jn all stages of, progress.
Â¦ and, what .' is .'curious, some .being built
from above Instead of in the usual way.
Of . late years I think that some of the
crÂ«aUst triumphs of th* De^nny firm tuvÂ»
iam m tne ships they have built for tha
well known Ostenci-Do\er line. Amors
the most noted of these Is the Leopold
II. bought for the Belgian Government
for that service. Â«Â»nd sÂ»he makes 22 knots.
She is "10x33. witn 0 feet draught when
carrying a complement of passengers.
Another ship of which the firm Is very
justly proud Is the twin screw Bavarian
of the Allan line, picked out by the Gov
ernment on account of her stability and
excellence to serve as a transport during
the present war in South Africa. She ia
5*X>x.">?, arrl steams 17'/3 knots. Tha Okhla.
S2f.O tons, is a fair specimen of one ofl
their cargo boats and makes her steady,
9Vi knots. 'Â¦ ;Â¦>-
For the Dover-Ostend line the Dennys
have also built the Prlncesse Henrietta
and the Prlncesse Josephine. They bars
also built for the P. and O. Company 15
steamers, for the Austrian Lloyds 19. for
the Allan line 11, for the Compagcla
Tramatlantique 11, for the Union Steam-
Ship Company of New Zealand 23, and
so on.
The probability which now seems to
loom up Is that the Dennya will taka
their share in yacht building in the fu
ture, which up to now has not fallen to
their lot. Yacht owners, one would im
agine, are Just as anxious to have fins
work put into their boats as any passen
ger, company can be. and thus they will
turn their eyes toward. Dumbarton and
Denny Brothers.
Forward is the Denny idea, and at tha
present moment the firm Is engaged la
putting in and . equipping Its yard with
electrical driving plant and pneumatlo
riveting plant, being the first firm la
Great Britain to do so.
I think there is much In the work
turned out by the Dennys. and Us thor
oughness, owing to the extraordinarily
Â«>od terms which the firm makes a point
of being on with its hands. As an in
stance of the manner in which master
and- man agree for mutual benefit, there
is the standing instance of the year of
18S5, when the trade depression was so
great. During that period the workmen
voluntarily ottered to accept reduced,
wages in order to enable the firm to build
ships on the chance of selling them when
completed, and in that way keep their
works going when no orders were forth
coming. BR9GB
For" the men there Is a Joint scheme for
giving compensation for men injured by
accident, and thus the annoyances of
lawsuits and the consequent in feellngf
are. avoided. The men receive adequate
compensation without appeal to the law
courts. This is known throughout tho
trade, and so It Is that the very best men
and rising talent among the skilled labor
ers are always anxious to get into their
employ. It Is somewhat like the condi
tion existing, at Ratsey & Lapthorp's. tha
famous sailmakers, where members of
the same families serve from generation
to.seneration.
The town of Dumbarton Is also In many
ways , a large debtor to the name of
Dennyâ to begin with, for the gift of a
splendid public park, provided with a
band and other attractions, whera the
people can find rational amusement in
stead of being driven Into the public
house for want of something better to do

WILLIAM DENNY & BROTH
ERS is the name of a firm ' at
Dumbarton which of late has
come Into immediate promi
nence in the yachting world, for
It is that cf the builiers of Sir Thomas
Upton's new challenger, the Shamrock II.
It may at first sight seem strange that
a firm up to now quite unknown ap yacht
builders shoujd suddenly be chosen to
construct the craft upon which the eyes
cf the yachting fraternity will this year
be fixed. According to the members of
the firm of Denny the Shamrock II is the
first important sailing yacht they have
ever built. Of steam yachts they have
built jurt one. They are very proud of
her, as she now floats in one of their
elips, rapidly being prepared to be put
Into commission in about eight weeks'
time, or perhaps a little longer.
But when you know more about the firm
of Denny & Brothers the reasons why
the firm should be chosen by so keen a
business man as Sir Thomas Lipton in
conjunction with such a careful and well
known designer as George Watson are
cot far to seek.
For years, many years, the firm of Wil
liam Denny & Brothers has been known
In the mercantile marine as one turning
out chips ordered of it in the most re
liable manner as regards high finish and
strength. Its name in this respect has
become a household word. To quote the
words of a well known scientific paper.
the Engineer:
"The shipyard of Messrs. William Den
ny & Brothers occupies a prominent posi
tion among the shipbuilding firms of the
Clyde, both in regard to the extent of ita
resources, the amount of tonnage it pro
duces, the quality of its work and the
scientific thoroughness of its methods. It
Is perhaps the last named characteristic
which gives this firm its distinctive mark
end entitles it to stand in the front rank
of British shipbuilders."
This Is exactly what etrikes a visitor
tf the works, as I have been. It is doubt
less exactly what struck Sir Thomas Lip
ton at the time he was looking around for
a builder.
Those works bear In every spot and cor
ner of them an impression of thorough
ness, of great conceptions, of united effort
and concentrated engineering genius, to
gether with a perfection of organization
which makes you ponder and wonder.
Just think of it, some four to five thou
sand EkUied workmen, ranging from engi
neers and designers down to the forge
hammer tender and the riveter, all work*
Ing away, each as though *ome part of a
great mechanical whole â never a hitch,
never an idle hand among them. There
are seven miles of DecauvIIle railway,
narrow gauge, laid down all over the yard
lor the expediting of material from one
place to another. Donkey engines are
puffing and hurrying to and fro with a
feverish haste. Forges with great
Nasmyth hammers all In a row beat vase
masses of xnet&l Into needed shapes.
Huge stores are here where anything can
be furnished from a needle to a shaft for
the screw cf the largest oe*an 6teamshlrÂ».
Huge iron and steel ships for ocean trade
are numerous at the docks.
. A telephone office is here with a couote
of score of instruments, so that the firm
can at will telephone not only all over the
yard, from end to en I. but four hundred
miles away, to London itself. Next that
is a fully equipped ambulance room, a's->
a specie.' and very elaoorate photograhic
department, and away opposite a meteora
logical department.
The secret. !t sterns to me. of the Den.
ny business lies in the belief of eve ry
member of the firm ttat .if you want a
thing thoroughly good and well done you
must look after it yourself;' Thus they
have within their work's not only tl>#
means necessary for the building of the
hull and frame of the ship but also rf ai
most all the accessorial ./ Would you Be
lieve itâ arid it Is typ;eal - of the firm
that not only can it build ships of any

required by his patient for his daily al

to crave the tobacco as eagerly as he did
previous to tho treatment. ' The doctor ex
presses his belief that he will permanently
cure the dbg. although he has been a con
firmed fiend for .three years and ten
months.
Sport has formed a great attachment
for Dr. McClelland and meets him every
morning- two blocks from his house, where
he patiently waits for a chew of the weed.
No ona Is allowed to give Sport any to
bacco except his attending physician, who
deals It out to him In doses as the case
demands.
Part of Lhe treatment is ?*vs r.^lririK
terlng of an antidote hypodormlculUV
Nitro-glycerln and sulphate of Â»trychÂ«
nia and two of the ingredients liithi
medication. Sport visits the doctor's offic*
several times a day and Invariably carrl-i
some trlfilnc article In .his mouth wlU
which he hopes. to bribe him into. giving
him some tobacco in return. The doctor
gives Sport, the prescribed dose,' and- thÂ«
dog lies on h!a backrafter he has swal
lowed it. When hV, in fully* under, tin
narcotic Influence. Sport will remain in
this position, for at least one > hour. At
intervals, however,- he will open his eyes
and glare about him in the most terrifv
ine manner. From that - stagti he Â¦ passes

to 'another /^herein he appears , to be hay- :
ii}B. pleasant dreams. .His -face .will show-
Joy busness, which is finally merged Into
ili-fl cf sorrow, and he begins to moan
convulsively.
After recovering from his stupor Sport -
Immediately goes in quest of more tobac

Is administered. . _-..Â¦,' : . .
It. is supposed that Sport acquired the
tobacco - habit at a time - when Mr. Mc-
Gowan was camping, in : the higher moun
'.talh T ranges Â¦ of Tuolumne County. He wa3
i of course accompanied by Sport, who goc3
with ; him on , all . of , his 1; Journeys. 'Â¦ In the
immediate vicinity, of ,the place .where the
dog and \ his master were quartered ivrat
a ;' sheep â¢Â¦ camp, the Â¦ sheep . having ;_ been
driven : there for the cummer, ; as ' the f el-i
was scarce on the lower ranges.
The herder had In his possession a quan
tity of tobacco which he used in making
sheep dip to be applied to the skins of
sheep ha\'lng scale. The" tobacco - was
dally, disappearing in a mysterious man
ner,; much to the consternation of the
herder, who for a- long time could not
locate' the pilferer. ;" He^. continued to re
main in a quandary at the -disappearance
of his tobacco until finally his suspicions*
rested on some of the-numerous camperj
who were hunting and fishing near by.
One day while pursuing his Investigations
ln'pVde'r' to catch the culprit, the herder
was surprised upon entering-' one of 'the
Many and varied are the stories related
of Sport. Here is one. Mr. Hill .of Co
lumbia.. CaK, was passing his > owner's
Btore carrying a large plajr of tobacco in
his hand. Sport bumped up against Hill
and knocked the tobacco to the sidewalk.
He thereupon seized the. tobacco and
ecaznpered oil to some hiding-place to
eat It. , -- .Â¦ a*\,
Besides chev/ing tobacco Sport per
forms a variety cf tricks.- He does the
marketing for hla owner and also deliv
ers and fetches the mail. He stands erect
on his hind legs, walks a tight rope and
when asked to smile for a chew of the
weed will relax his jaws in the most
amusing . fashion. The dog is brown In
color arid i3 a first-class retriever. A
wealthy mining man of Xew York City
once offered Mr. McGowan I3W In gold for
Spcrt. He desired to place the dog in a
dime museum in Boston, but Mr. Mc-
Gowan refused the offer. Sport 13 a great
favorite among commercial travelers,
many of when will immediately recog
nize bis photographs in this article. The
doc is the r.crr.e of sociability and 13 a
great favorite among children, though, it
cannot be said that he is as fond of them
os he 13 of tobacco.
The herder Immediately notified I Mr.
McGowan that he had discovered the thief
and demanded payment for all the tobac
co that had been Stolen. Mr.. McGowan
was thereupon obliged to make good the
herder's loss, which was considerable.
Then It was found out that Sport a'te to
bacco Â¦whenever he could beg," boerow or
steal it. After several years his owner
has engaged the services cf Dr. McClel
land to see if a cure can be effected. . .
eab'.ns to find Sport lying on the floor
upon his back In what appeared to be a
beastly state of lntojiJcatlorj with tobacco
juice in large quantities oozing from his
mouth.
Â£~P\HERE have been tobacco fiends bÂ£
| fore. There have also been to-
I baceo fiends who took the tobacco
I cure. But they were not, as a
rule, dogs.
That is what makes George Mc-
Gowin't '"Sport" a remarkable dog. He
Is now taking daily several hypodermic
Injections of nitro-glycerln and sulphale
of strychnia in order to cure a habit
which has held possession of him for al
most four years. 1'nder the care of Dr.
Hugh K. McClelland he I? showing a
marked improvement and there Is ijood
Itason to hope that in time he will have
gained complete control over the drug
which is now his master.
He lives in Sonera, Tuolumne County,
end of all the freaks that the town can
boast of Sport carries oft* the honors. He
displays a wonderful appetite for the
noxious herb. He not only masticates It,
but- cats It a* voraciously a* he would
devour a succulent chop. When Sport
evinces his desire for tobacco he acts in
ell reecectK like a human opium fiend,
who insists on the gratification of his
abnormal taste at any cost. Sport looks
up appealingly when the craving takes
hold of him and mutely Implores users of
"tobacco for a chew. He trembles vio
lently and rmits piteous whines which
r.ne finds it impossible to Ignore. Only
after he r.aÂ« been provided with thÂ« wee<l
Â¦vrili he desist in his pleadings and flnall)
succumb to its effects.
The deg is owned by George McGowan,
who k*-eps a cigar store In Sonora.
Sport is a thoroughbred water spaniel
snd is va'.uMi by his owner at $300. The
dog possesses other cccoznpllshxnents be
sides that of rplne tobacco In large quan
tities, but the last named has been euffl.
dent to bring him into prominence among
the visitors to Sonora and the inhabitants
of the surroundlns towns.
The tobacco habit has taken such a
strong bold of Sport that Mr. McGowan
finally engaged the services of Dr. Mc-
Clelland to cure his four-footed charge.
Sport ha* now been under the treat
ment for the last four months and a per
ceptible improvement has resulted. The
usual quantity of tobacco consumed by
the dog before he was taken in hand for
treatment was one-half pound of the weed
In twenty-Icur hours. After four months'
treatment he now eats only half that
amount with no appreciable change In his
frencral health. It must be understood
that Sport does not simply smoke or
chew the tobacco, but masticates It end
ewallows the amount named.

is the selection or the creature for

babyhood, evinces a comedy spirit.
In the Norris & Rowe's animal show the
clown dog. Zip. from puppyhood evinced
a desire for Joking which caused his fel
low canines many an unpleasant moment.
Beauty, one of the most aristocratic dogs
in the ehow, was never known to skip rope
on his hind legs, but holds himself aloof
â¢with an air of pride. Zip takes especial
delight in scorning this lofty creature
whenever the opportunity presents Itself,
much to the amusemr-nt of the other per
formers in the "school." and many of
Zip's tricks in this act bave b4en suggest

Odd Idea of Building Crooked Houses
One of the curious things to attract the
attention of visitors to Holland is the
leaning of a great majority of the houses.
To see certain parts of Rotterdam and
Amsterdam it would seem as though there
were no bouses there standing perfectly
straight and that great numbers of them
must collapse. In buildings side by side
some will lean forward, some backward
and others sidewise. Their -old cracked
walls suggest that It Is the result of age,
while of course it Is principally due to
the soft, wet ground on which they are
constructed.
There are, however, many buildings In
these cities, says Pearson's Weekly,
which were originally and unmistakably
built out of the straight. For Instance,
not for from the Hotel Vleux-Doeien.
where the delegates to tire Peace Confer
ence stayed, there Is an extension being
built to one of the churches, and although
the walls are not yet completed they lean
outward more than twelve- inches.
Another Instance of this is found In
come of the corner houses, whose walls
lean out over each street. In many cases
new houses are evidently'put up to match
the houses' alongside. Â¦ Strangely ' enough,'
though, there are comparatively few cases
on record of collapse.
At Frankfort-on-the-Maln, though - of
course such construction is not' common
in Germany, there is one street in which
two houses on opposite sides of the street
lean over bo far that their roofs meet." in
one of these /houses Lord Rothschild was
born. In Paris, on the other hand, It is
noticeable that the builders intentionally
construct the houses so that they lean
backward slightly, to add to " their sta
bility. . âÂ¦-.
But almost in the center of Paris there
Is one big stone building which leans out
fully three and one-half . feet over the
sidewalk. So solid, however, are the Paris
buildings that this one is claimed to be

shortly afterward married James Stark,
the tragedian, and was widely known
professionally as Sallle Stark. In the '70' s
she retired from the s'.age, having ac
quired considerable property In the Mis
sion district, and soon after became the
wife of Charles R. Thome Sr.
Fortune did not smile favorably upon
the combinations at the two pieces last
mentioned, and when the Phoenix Theater
opened, March 23, 1850, on Pacific street,
near Kearny, there was practically no op
position to "Seeing the Elephant," which
was there presented by Sophie Ejdwin.
The Phoenix Exchange, on Portsmouth
square, devoted to tableaux vlvants, or a
model artist exhibition, began a brief ca
reer on the 24th. and Henri Hertz, the cel
ebrated rlanist, made his first appearance
at the National on April 2. On this occa
sion Slgnor Roncovleri, who subsequently
became a favorite operatic artist and a
respected resident of San Francisco, sang
for the first time In public.
Just about this time there began some
thing like a reign of terror in the over
crowded and bustling city. Disastrous*
fires were of such frequent occurrence and
of such frightful proportions as to pro-,
sent almost insurmountable obstacles to
the merchants, capitalists . and specula*
ors, who were crowding the town ready
and anxious to put up new buildings. Tho
great conflagration of May 4, 1850, which
came very near wiping out everything in

given in San Francisco, has never
been written, and the interesting in
cidents of the earliest days of the stage
live for the most part in the memories of
the rapidly diminishing band of hardy
pioneers who came here in "the days of
old. the (Jays of gold, the days of '49."
The great rush to Sacramento after the
discovery at Sutler Creek made the little
peaport of Yerba Buena simply a way
Etation on the great road to the mines.
In those days Sacramento was the Mecca
toward which afl pilgrims turned, and the
first theater in California was naturally
located at the present capital.
It is more than likely that at the Mis
sion Dolores. TÂ«hÂ«re there Â¦was. an estab
lished Spanish settlement, and at Mon
terey, which was a more or less import
ant port, there had been entertainments
In the Spanish language, but the first
English performance of any note in San
Francisco v.-as civen at the old police of
fice, on the southwest corner of Ports
mouth square, on June 22, 1S43, by Steve
Massett. professionally known as Jeems
Pipes of Pipesville.
Four months later to a day the Phila
delphia Minstrels, the first company of its
kind, appeared at Bella Union Hall, the
entrance to which was on Washington
street, west of Kraray, instead of on
Kearny, where the old Bella Union Thea
ter still stands. The company Included
C. Calverd. Frank Richmond (afterward
known as Wheeler), Dick de Brough, R.
fle Meyer, W. H. Smith. W. Wallace. B.
11. Brower ar.d Collins and Engles. The
Jprice of admission was J2.
The Pacific Minstrels were then an
nounced to open Washington Hall, located
on Washington street, between Kearny
and Dupont, on Christmas eve, but owing
to a large fire In the business portion of
the town the company did not materialize.
However, on the 18th of January, 1S30,
the Fame house was occupied by a com
pany which had been playing at the Eagle
Theater, in Sacramento, where a rise In
the river had flooded the city December'
4, 1S4S. This was the first regular dra
matic performance In San Francisco and
the play presented was "T..e Wife," with
J. B. Atwater as Julian Gt. Pierre. H. F.
Daly as Ferrado, J. H. McCabe as Father
Antonio and* Mrs. F. Rea as Mariana.
Messrs. Fairchlld. Wright, Harris and
Rea were also In the cast. This engage
ment was Bhort. sharp and decisive, for
here was established a managerial prece
dent which has been followed more or
less religiously for many years.
The performance gave entire satisfac
tion and all looked promising for an ex
tended engagement until, in response to
the usual salary call, the company as
sembled at the theater. On this occasion
the treasurer, a Mr. Mattinson, made a
reluctant and dejected entrance to explain
that he had played a special engagement
at the Bella Union and ftad lost the entire
week's receipts at monte. It Is hardly
necessary to state that the company re
fused to continue and sought other en
gagements. Mr. and Mrs. Rea sailed for
Honolulu and other members Joined forces
Â¦with Mr. and Mrs. Batters. Mr. and Mrs.
McCron and Messrs. Carleton, Campbell
.and Jbl'tchcll, who had just arrived from
Australia. They opened at Rowe's circus,
renamed the Amphitheater. February I.
1S51. In the first production of "Othello"
ever given in Ean Francisco.
On the 19th of the same month the Na
tional Theater, located on Washington
street, between Montgomery and Kearny,
waa dedicated by a French company in a
mixed programme, and at the Amphithea
ter the celebrated actress Mrs. J.
fa. KIrby made her first appear
ance here as Pauline in "The
street, between Clay and Washington,
waa dedicated by a French company, Au
gust 1, 1S51. and the cornerstone of the
New American Theater was laid Septem
ber 15. About this time Frank S. Chan
frau, Charles R. Thome Sr. and Miss Al
bertine came from the East, and from
Sacramento, where the Tehama Theater
had been destroyed by flre, there came
T. M. Kent. Kate Grey and Mrs. Mary
Woodward. The three last named, with
Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Booth, began an en
gagement at the opening of the third
Jenny I.liid. October 4. Â¦ '- :â¢ ,
Mr. and Mrs. George Chapman, Mary
Chapman. Clara Rivers and Miss Joseph
ine also drifted down from the capital to
take part in the grand opening of the
American Theater, which occurred on Oc
tober 20, under the direction of James
Stark, lessee, who presented "The Peer
and the Peasant."
Mr. Chanfrau and Miss Albertlne made
their first appearance, October 27, at the
Jenny Llnd, in "Pleasant Neighbors," and
with a large number of other well-known
players, located at the other houses, the
second year of California theatrical his
tory closed with benefits all around, and
it was well into the spring of 1SS2 before
everybody had been served.
Prices of admission, which had been
high, particularly for the upper portions
of the houses, began to be trimmed a lit
tle for dramatic performances, but on
February 9. 1S5*. when Buckley's Serenad
ers gave the first minstrel show for many
months at the Adelphi the best seats were
S3. Rainer & Donaldson's Minstrels
opened at the Jenny Lind, March 1. at
somewhat less figures for admission, and
enother batch of benefits was handed
around at the dramatic houses.
Madame Elscaccianti worked a string of
ce!ect concerts at the American during
April, 1S52, and during the next month
The Alleghanlans, who came to California
over the Nicaragua route, gave concerts
In various theaters, halls and churches,

to enumerate the circuses and amphithea
ters which were being continually

period already covered, or to mention all
the music halls and so-called lyric thea
ters that opened in the early fifties. Ar
mory Hall, at the corner of Washington
and Sansome streets, opened September
13, 1S32. with The Alleghanlans as the at
traction, and here another digression is
in order.
Among a score of old-timers who have a
distinct recollection of the toll eats on
Kearny street there Is the most surprising
difference of opinion as to its exact loca
tion. A large majority unite upon the
northwest corner of Post and Kearny as
the place where the old tollhouse stood,
but there are others who are even more
positive that It was located nearer Bush
or Pine street.
The confident assertions as to the local
ity, name, date of opening and description
of attractions at the theaters mentioned
above are well founded. Unaided by doc
umentary evidence it would have been im
possible to give anything like a satisfac
tory statement of the theatrical situation
during San Francisco's infancy. The
writer has had the advantage of the use
of the carefully kept diary of an old-time
actor, who was himself a member of the
first dramatic company ever seen in San
Francisco. More of him and his Illus
trious associates of over half a century
past will be said later on, but It is proper
at this time to forestall any contradic
tions as to the facts and figures herein
set forth, all of which have been verified
as Â¦ carefully as possible by reference to
the earliest newspapers and other pub
lished authorities, as well as by consulta
tion with at.d advice from many of tho
veterans who have pfeasant and reliable
memories of the first theatrical perform
ances in San Francisco.

ren, who are often blessed with a numer

it appeared thai among the e\ - a"ngellcal
clergy only fa prr cent of -the expected
deaths had otcurred, while among the
Reman Catholic clergry 112 por cent had
occurred. The great mortality of the
Roman Catholic clergy Dr. Prinzing con
siders chiefly due to diseases of the organs
cf circulation, inducting cclebral paraly
tla. The development of these diseases is
not, as Professor Karup shows Jn .'the
"JiJirbuch for NationaJekenomie," pro-
moted especially by any peculiarities of
professional activity; It is rather only a
consequence of certain habits of life for
which the profession, with its obligation
of celibacy, must be held primarily re
sponsible. We quote tho following com
ments on Dr. Prinzing'i conclusions, from
the Boersen Zeitung: .
"The most important reason for the
claim that marital life in Itself diminishes
mortality is the fact. In accordance with
Prinzlng's exposition, that there, is a
greater mortality among the husbands
and wives who have lost their, consorts
than among those who ; are still. married,
and that women who are single do not die
off much more /quickly â¢ than married
women. The greater mortality among wid
owers is probably traceable to the depri
vation of the care to which they have
been accustomed. SEiIIBHI
"It has been ascertained that suicide Is
more frequent among the unmarried than
among the , married. Durkheim's book on
suicide states that among men suicide Is
most frequent among the unmarried,
less so among the widowers and very
much less so Â¦ among the married;
that among women suicide most seldom
occurs among those who are married, and
more frequently amocg widows." : [ Â¦'.[.

THERE Is no end to the elaborate
hair ornaments for sale In the shops
âJeweled aigrettes, spangled bows,
glittering pins. But over them all
In fcwauty ranks the flower in the
hairâ there is no ornament that adds bo
much to youth and charm. It is wonder
ful, too, what different, widely different
effects can be produced by dlffereht ar
rangements of even a single rose*
Take the statriy girl, for instanceâ the
one who dresses her hair high and carries
her head as Gibson has taught her. She
will choose two or three large roses and
wear them high apainst the knot of her
hair. If she has an eye for art as well as
a queenly bearing Fhe will pull one rose
slightly forward and to one side, to break
the etiffness of a too precise effect.
If she aims at a cold and stately pose,
let ber remember that once she lets the
rose droo over the ear all the ice has
melted. She is a coquette then, and there
is no way that she can make herself more
wltclilng. A charming style is that of
two bunches of email flowersâ the one
caught Into the knot of hair, the other
caught over the ear. ; > ;
Now that the Janice Meredith curl is a
raging fad. the wearers of it have learned
that m. cluster of flowers pinned close to
tfie seek. Just where the cur! starts, adds
to tha quaint demureness of the halrdress
ing. There is a coquetry, too, hidden un
der the demurcness of the fashion.
The Oriental beauties have taught the
trick cf a rose ever each ear, and the girl
Vho has clastic features is safe to try it.
'Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢
It Is a queenly style and "a string of pearls
laid across the hair adds to the crate 'of
the effect, Bernhardt'i favorite plcturo
of 'herself, you may remember, was taken
with this arrangement of flowers. -
For the young girl flowers are of course
the only ornament, besides a simple rib
bon that should beiworn. There la no way
so girlish to arrange them as in a simple
wreath over the loose falling locks.. Small
flowers are prettier than large. . Baby
roses are 'especially good.
The Spanish woman, coquette of co
quettes, knows the value of a rose In the
hair. She catches it In the fold of her
mantilla or lets It droo over her car. -
Every girl should remember that there
Is one style that fits her face and manner
better than any other. Once it is discov
ered, let her stick to It. The placing of
the flower changes the shape of the face
andÂ»alters the appearance of the features.
Don't lengthen a too long face by piling
the adornments on top of the head, nor
broaden on*e already too broad by. the
Oriental arrangement.
Color, too, should be considered. This
usually 'depends upon. the costume; but It
Is worth while to remember that the whitÂ©
or cream flowers are more becoming, to
dark hair thsfc to light. A yellow rose Is
exquisite In bright, gold yellow hair, and
pink flowers may be worn above any clear
complexion. Red roses are proverbially
for the brunette, the Spanish-eyed beauty,
but there seems no reason other than tra
dition why the blonde should consider
herself shut out" from their use.

Proressor Mathleu of Paris said that In

Olive Oil is Splendid for Indigestion.
ONE has only to consider how olive
oil is used in the warm parts of
Kurope where' the olive Is culti-
vated, and how ghee is used In
India in order; to satisfy one's self that
oily matter may be taken with facility Jn
hot countries as well as In cold. You hear
nothing about indigestion in these lands;
you find that a bad olive harvest or scant
supply of ghee is a great national calam
ity. A -Hindoo Â¦ servant of a friend who
kept ud his Indian habits of eating in
London has told me that in his own case
nothing would make up for a deficiency
of ghee or butter, and that his experience
in this matter was the common experience
of his countrymen away from home. ( In
deed, it maybe-taken for granted that oil
may be used In large' quantities through
out tho. year In the hot, olive-grooving
countries :of . the south of, Europe, not
only without making the people bilious or
out of order in any. way, but with unmis

Several years ago M. Boullat made a
clock of straw which attracted much at

the tenth commandment for at least

It -was a painful moment when I

The maid had disappeared, having
forgotten to sew on the slipper bui-
Th- hare's foot couldn't be found

There was a general nux-up be

have to step out and get in all over

Â¦would have passed the editor of any

That was because I had been ir.

when her tvro performances had been

the heat received by this 'earth. Now, it
was a well-known fact that most things
in cooling become smaller; a poker, for
example, was hhorter when it was cold
than when It was hot. The sun. too, must
obey this fundamental law. and must
therefore be getting smaller. If we could
measure its (jjameter on two surcessive
days we should find it had decreased by
nine inchesâ that was to say,'- it-' was
shrinking at the rate of, roughly, five feet
a week., or a mile in every twenty years.
In view. of this shrinkage flume of the
younger members of his audience micht
feel apx!oua lest the sun should not last
their lime. Such anxiety.'.' however,'-- was
groundless;" he. was 800,00!) milrs in diam

Death in Stow for Dewet. â¢'
"Whatever the result of the peace- nego
tiations between General Kitchener and
General Botha, it Is tolerably certain that
the rumors of the inclusion of General
Dewet in any form of amnesty are not
based on fact. General Kitchener** per
sonal views of the Boer leaders are ndt
known in Pall Mall, but if the "War Offlco
Is consulted th^ officials there would rath
er see Dewet killed In action than taken
alive. One of the officials responsible for
the direction of the affairs of the army
said: â¢ . .
"I cannot see- bow Kitchener can poÂ«-
Blbly accept Dewefs surrender. If he ever
gets him he will be obliged to try him for
his recent alleged murders' of prisoners.
I have no doubt that the verdict of either
a military or a civil court would be death,
and if such a verdict was carried- out
there -would ba a. horrible howl onv the
Continent and in America. And, Indeed,
one would be sorry to see such a brave
fighter "meet such an end. Therefore., wÂ«
can only hope Dewet will either be- let out
of the country or shot in battle." .

banquet hall pro tern, were hung, with the
choicf-et pictures of the Institute's spring
exhibition, thr.own into relief by the dark
tone of their background.
Splendid pink roses, great purple fleurs
de lis and delicate maescs of fragrant
pear blossoms formed the center piece of
the table, mingling their delightful Trag
rance with the equally pleasant aroma ojf
the choicest vintages of California. At the
extreme end of the hall, from a screened
galle^iTt the strains of a well regulated
orchestra resounded. The other end was
occupied with a clever device, a tribute
to the visitorsâ an Immense plaque of
dark, glossy green orange leaves, edged
with a fringe of Kaster lilies; In the
center, formed of immense golden pop
pies, was the word "Chicago." Toward
this centerpiece radiated from every- di

the opposing sentries stood face to face

are outnumbered by the British twenty
to one, but unless St. Petersburg takes a
conciliatory view of the- incident the Rus

from the position In which the latter are
now strongly entrenched.
Every influence has been brought to

VETV YORK. March 16.â A "World spe

E'.aa Imbroglio at Tientsin Is regarded
here as exceedingly grave. It being be
lieved that ths Russian general would
never have committed such an act of ag
gression without epeciflc instructions. The
fear Is that Russia, apprehending an early
termination of the South African war is
possible. Is asserting herself in China be
fore England's" hands are free.
The Immediate effect of the Anglo-Rus-
Eion friction in the Far East would be to
destroy whatever chance England h-as o/

Another, sweeping measure Is Assembly
constitutional amendment No. 28, to con
solidate all commissions In a single' State
Commission, :' which- -is given: absolute
power â¢ OA'er all corporations.' a measure
which will cau*e much, uneasiness -trÂ» the
Republican party in the coming elections.
A large number of measures emanating
from corporation sources have - been on
the. boards for action. Some" of the most
notorious of, these measures, were the
Broughton franchise bill, Tyrrell insur.
ance bill and Curtln assessment bill. Tha
latter ( was bitterly? contested.- resort be
ing had to trading of all kinds, particu
larly on the apportionment bill. - -^ -,.;*
\ Trading , of votes has been notoriously
prevalent during- this- session,- notwith
standing the admonKlon in the message
of the Governor,' thug resulting in the
passage of many bills carrying unneces
sary appropriations. Â¦â¢Â«â¢>. -Â¦.â¢â¢Â¦
Taking everything Into consideration
it must be. conceded that little has been
accomplished by the Assembly which will
earn the. confidence 'of the people" ~ or
strengthen the Republican party. -Â¦.;Â¦-<>- v
i While the legislative proceedings ? ; have
been comparatively free-from scandal/ it
must be admitted thnt they have Â¦ been aN
most barreo of beneficent results.
Some Corporation Bills.
.The reapportlonment bills at present are
unfairly partisan, perhaps the most lu
diccous effort, at gerrymandering- yet dis
played in any countrV. The: provisions of
the constitution In this regard has been
disregarded. < . . . ' . â¢
A very Important work of the present
session -has been the ndopHon of. the
Penal. Civil and Civil Procedure Codes,
and although there are many Innovations
and nnveHleit contained In these codes,
the general desire; has: been to simplify
practice and remove : objectionable â¢ mat
ters In present codes. It. may be that all
this, work has bepn for naught, as la
claimed by many that the titles to these
respective acts are rr> 'defective as to in
validate the bills. â¢ However, much credit
is due, the Code Commissioners for their
diligent work.' â¢ . Â¦Â¦'Â¦â¢Â¦
The San Francisco delegation has been
almost unanimous In. an Intense desire to
he rid of the charter/many bills having
been introduced to- supersede that instru
ment, which bills if they become laws
will perhaps have no other effect than to
produce litigation. . One of the most
roweeplng measures to attain this ; end Js
constitutional amendment No. 17. by Sn.vÂ«
age, which if adopted will have tha effect
of abrogating 'every charter In the State,
and confer Â« on the Legislature the
power to control municipal affairs.
Unfair Apportionment.
The Republican majo'-jty in both houses
Is too overwhelming to conserve the best
interests of the State, the party'or Â»hc in
dividual members. ' Anv measure hav-'nt?
a political . significance favorable , to.' the
majority was i rushed through, regardless
as was evidenced by the passage of. Sena
tor Oneal's bill depriving- tho Scnnte of
power of confirming gubernatorial- ap
pointments. , Other measure* of poiitirai
significance were the # "bjboalc plagiM
bills," which were to iÂ«upp>rt the Gov
ernor in the Klnyoun controversy. It
would be only fair to sugto~t. however,
that It Is doubtful if Â»he multifarious res
olutions on this subject arising in the
houses met with the Governor's sanction.
The whole controversy on the plague 1 sitr
uation was merely a -whirlwind; which has
expended its force.
The measure which will reflect most
credit on the Legislature and confer. most
benefit on the city of 6an Francisco and
the State at large and particularly all tho
southern and central portions of the Stat*
Is the lease of the China Basin totha

SACRAMENTO, March 16.-Compaml
with the session of 1S99, with all its
attendant Senatorial entanglements,
the present session is slow and In
ert. The people at largo will perhaps con
grratulate t !theniselves 'hat so few meas
ures have become enacted. There is noth
ing, thatfwlll commemorate the thirty
fourth session in history. Extravagance .
has been the keynote *or the majority jf
the members. Very few bills or. resolu
tions carrying: appropriations .havs met
with defeat. The barriers of the Belshaw
act were Jet down and attaches came In
swarms. The Senate, with a' naenabersh'p
of forty, had about a hundred and thirty
five persons on the payroll and, the situa
tion In the Assembly wa3, no better.
SACRAMENTO. March 15.-At the
day o? final adjournment each suc
ceeding .Legislature is pronounced
"the worst the State has ever
seen" and thanks go up to the Creator
that It has reached the end of its evil
career. But the fact -hat the people con
tinue to elect about rhe same class of
men year after vear to make their laws
is some evidence that they are, after aU,
not wholly dissatisfied with the results.
Either this or else they are impotent to
elect better men.
This Legislature is no* better nor wors*
than its predecessors and the result of us
labors will fall into tne same category
as that of previous sessionsâ chiefly unim
portant. It is this characteristic of legis
lation in all the States which saves the'
laws from utter Â»*hao8. If every bill weiiÂ»
one-tenth part as important as its author
thinks it is the social fabric would soon
fall into shreds.
In the Senate there has been less de
liberation, less debate and opinions have
been reserved until the moment for final
action less than in the three preceding
sessions, and I think the opposite is true
of the Assembly. In ihc former It nis
too often been the case that members, on
an ex pane statement by the author or
some other friend of the bill, have prom
ised their votes; and a piomlse once given
has uniformly been kept. In the' lowrr
house there has pot been so much "pro
gramming," as it is called.
A quarter of a million has been given
to the University, of California fqr the
next biennial period, and as near as it
could do bo this Legislature has com
manded future onos to give that institu
tion J190.OOO a year regu'arly.
A notable feature of the trend of leg
islation Is found in the increasing de
mands upon the public treasury for pub
lic improvements. The impounding of de
bris, the Improvement of navigation and
drainage, the storage and conservation of
water for irrigation, the purchase of for
ests for recreation grounds and the con
struction of public highways are but a
portion of the subjects proposed,' and In
each case urged with great vigor by at
least a portion of the people, i We have
appropriated a quarter of a million dol
lars for the purchase of â¢ a redwpod for
est, and notice has already been served
that the next Legislature will be asked
to do as much for the preservation of
some sugar pine timber. The heavy de
mands for money for road building were
pressed by the peopla at home with great
vigor and peiriKteney. It is current newa
about the Capitol that the Gove.rnor re
ceived 127 telegrams in -one day .from. one
county urging him to sign one of these
bills. In thÂ« slang of thÂ« dav. it is up to
the people to say what the State's policy
shall be in these matters, and next year's
State conventions will do a wise thing if
they make unequivocal declarations on
tfcesa subjects. .

SACRAMENTO. ' March W.â This has
been â¢ a- hard-working.- businessllk*)
session. It has been c'.ear cut and
clean. White the Legislature ha3
kept In view the necessity of strict econ
omy In" the expenditure -of .public moneys
it has not hesitated to make procer ap
propriations where helpful and construct
ive legislation demanded them. While the
aid of the calcium Heht which the press
throws upon the work of a session < In
the fierce Clare of a Senatorial contest
has been wanting to show, up the possible
Iniquity lurking In anv.. bill , and the. , lop
large majority of the dominant party
might have invited recklessness or extrav-
agances.no session has been, freer* from
scandals and no-8ession has accomplished
more in the way of positive legislation. â¢
The general appropriation bill has cut
off: all needless expense of maintenance
in the ..public', service, and the State tax
rate is the lowest in . many a year. The
large growth in population in Alamed.i
aod Los Angeles counties has necessitated
a ' of Assembly. Senato
rial and Congressional districts to conform
to the changed conditions. "Every possible
effort has been made to frame an hones i
primary law, and It. is believed that -the'
bill passed will, if It be approved, maku
it possible for political decency to control
the organizations of both political parties
In the. large center? of population and for
the San Francisco delegation In our Stito
conventions to be -something more than a
bunch of asparagus ..tied by a string In
the hands of a boss.
While the bill of the water and forest
people has unfortunately received the
Gubernatorial ax.: the primeval redwoods
will wave forever.-"-
The ratification of the China Basin
lease to the Santa Fe Railway system at
the request of the mercantile interests of
San Francisco will materially aid in the
immediate construction of- terminal and
seawall facilities, so much needed by the
expanding commerce of the metropolis.
This legislation will aid In anchoring the
commercial supremacy of the Pacific
Slope -at San FVancisco. It is one step in
the building of a great emporium at the
Golden Gate.
The revision of the Civil Code of Civil
Procedure and Pcn'al â¢ Code Is the com
pletion of a much-needed and most im
portant work. The magnitude of \ the leg
islation will not be fully understood or
appreciated by the *pub!lc or even by the
legal profession until the, enrolled copies
of the acts are generally distributed, and ,
its advocates in the Legislature anticipate >
entire satisfaction at the hands -of both
the beneh and bar. â¢ ' . . â¢
" It Is to bÂ« regretted that the legislation
proposed to relieve the glut of business in
the Supreme Court by the creation of
three district courts of appeal was not!
adopted, but when the bill was on the eve
of passage it was defeated by the oppo- '
sltion of an interest very powerful In the
politics of the State. . Â¦ --.
This seFslon has been marked by a dis
position to treat all interests, including
corporate interests, fairly and to give
them legitimate protection. ' Whether the
constitutional amendment , for an omni
bus commission goes too farcin this direc
tion or not Is still a subject of contro
versy, but on that, as rm all constitu

bitrament will be the people.

London "Times". Reporters
May Be Excluded From
the House.
LONDON, March 16.â The members of
the House of Commons are greatly stirred
up by the London Times' alleged breach
of secrecy in regard to publishing in ad
vance the Government's civil list propo
sals.'
.A. curious feature /which has not leaked
out in the papers is the Implication of the
Birmingham Post in the same charges
and there is a half humorous and half se
rious attempt upon t&e part at tne Irtsfc
members to connect Josepn Chamberlain
with. the affairs The Birmingham Post is
one of Mr. Chamberlain's warmest sup
porters and if the Liberals can set this
organization punished they will take it as
a personal score off the much disliked Co
lonial Secretary." Â¦ A Conservative member
of Parliament informed ; a correspondent
that the majority of his party would be
delighted to Bee the London . Times sus
pended for. say, a week, not with the
idea of seriously -affecting its news serv
ice, -but With giving it a 'much-needed
lesson." Â»'â¢>Â«
Mr. Balf our, the Government leader in
the House of Commons; Sir Henry Caxnp
bell-Bannerman, the Liberal leader, and
Mr. Gully, the Speaker, have . been con
sulting together during the week. Among
the suggestions which they will consider
Is one to examine all the members of the
civil list committee separately, under
oath, and so run down the culprit
The Dally Mail, prints -an editorial in
this connection, headed "Unusually Direct
Charge of Venality in High Places." In
which it says:
"Should -the Speaker, as he certainly
won't decide to have the Times reporters
thrown'- out of the House. -our- contempo
rary would have no difficulty In employ
ing further honorable members or officials
to supply it with such news as ; it may
desire to publish... If the committee cannot
find. powers to act as the guardian of Its
own T honor and to prevent the disclosure
of information which is solely in its pos
session, there is no remedy."

Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not cor-
rectly understood: In most cases they are led to believe that womb trouble or fe-
male weakness of some sort Is responsible for their many Ills, waen, in fact, dis-'
ordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles. /
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or % dark circles under the eyes, rheu-
matism, a dragging pain or dull ache In the Dack. weakness or bearing down
sensation, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to
pass It night cr day. with scalding or burning sensation, â these are all unmistak-
able signs of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there is any doubt In your mind as to your condition, take from your urino
on rising about four ounces, place it in a glass or bottle and let it stand twenty-
four, hours. If on examination it is milky or cloudy. !f there is a brick-dust set-
tling, or if small particles float about in It. your kidneys are in need of inimedi- '
ate attention. . â¢
Other symptoms showing that you need 'Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizzi-
ness, irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of am-
bition but no strength. : J .Â¦Â¦ j
â¢ Swamp- Root Is pleasant to take and is used In the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians In their private practice, and Is taken by doctors them-
selves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound.
".If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root Is what you need, you can pur-
chase the regular fifty-cent and dne-dollar bottles at the drug stores everywhere.
NOTiCE.-Swamp-Root, the great Kidney. Liver and*
Bladder remedy, is so remarkably successful that a special arrangement has been
made by which all of our readers who have not already tried it may have a sam-

WHY; SO MANY FAIL
The Eeason, So Many Catarrh Rem-
edies Are Unsuccessful. :
There are few troubles for which there
are; so many > remedies and so-called
"cures'.' as- for, catarrh,- and it may v be
added there are few diseases ' so difficult
to really -and permanently; cure. . Â¦ ?
Inhalers, sprays, powders and douches
are all applied locally, and give temporary
relief, often for only a few. hours, and . it
is doubtful if. anything like a real euro of
catarrh was ever accomplished by the use
of 'local applications.
Catarrh is a constitutional disease; it is
in the blood like rheumatism, and to cure
it requires an i internal 'medicine to act
upon the -blood to drive out the catarrhal
poison. from the system entirely, and any
one can. readily 'see that. a salve or pow-
der, or inhaler which simply. clears off. the
mucous membrane of. the nose and throat
can have no effect on the real cause of
catarrhal j disease, v .
;The remarkable ' success ' of the new ca-
tarrh ".remedy, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
Is -5 because it; drives out - of the system
through , the . ; natural . channels the . ca-
tarrhal' poison, "the; germs of grip, bron-

Do you have a feeling of undue fullness
in the stomach, belchings, - or sour or
bitter risings ? These are but a few of ,
the symptoms of the diseased stomach.
The worst thing which can be done
for the stomach in such a case is to take
some tablet or powder which merely
gives temporary relief from discomfort.
The best thing to do is to begin the'eure
of the disease bv beginning the use of
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery.
It cures diseases of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition.
It makes the "weak" stomach .strong,
and puts the body in a condition of
vigorous health.
"I was troubled a long time with dyspepsia,
torpid liver, and constipation," writes Mrs. Julia
E. Deal, ot Ostwalt, Iredell Co., N. C. "Could
scarcely eat anything at all : would have attacks
of pain something like colic, and sometimes it
seemed as though- 1 -could not live, 'i wrote to
Dr. R. V, Pierce, stating my condition, and in a
few days received a kind letter of advice,' telling
me to 'use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery. I tools four bottles, and one vial of Dr.
Pierce's Pellets, and now I can eat anything I
want and it don't hurt me. I have not been in
bed a day since I took- your J Golden Medical
Discovery,' and I have not since felt any symp-
toms of disease. I have not taken any medicine
in twelve months.". ,\ 'â¢ .

Third House in Hawaii Pre
pares to Stir Up Terri
torial Laws.
Numerous Important Features in a
Definite Programme of Legisla
tion for County and City"
Government. ;' ;
Special Correspondence of The CalL"
HONOLULU, March 9.â Although not I
proclaimed from the housetops, it is no
secret to the well Informed that the Inde
pendent party majority in both houses of
the Territorial Lecislrture is shortly go-
Ing to "get in ind ride" to a triumphant
finish. It has a definite programme of leg
islation and control which it will press
through to the last number. This third
house is in nightly session and does more
work than is Jone in the legislative halls.
The main items of the Independent pro
gramme are: County government, city
government, a new taxation system.
BoarJ of Health leorganization, appro
priation bills ignoring the estimates pre
pared with many month sV labor by Gov
ernor Dole and the executive heads under
him and the revision of official appoint
ments by the Governor. The Independent
county government bill will be introduced
early the coming week and be rushed to
the point of presentation to the Governor
for his signature'within three days at the
outside.
Senator White of the island of Maui,
who is the lieutenant of Kalauokalani. the
party leader, and the tongue of the party
in the upper chamber, was the mover of a
rather peremptory resolution in that body
the other day asking the Governor to pro
duce with the least possible delay his
nominations for oflice. It is certain that
the Independents do not intend to confirm
more than one-half of the Governor's
nominations. : . '
With regard to the executive estimates,
there will be a merciless slashing of sala
ries. The determination Is to cut these
down by from S3 1-3 to 50 per cent. Heads
of departments allowed by the Governor
$4000 a year will be voted $1000 or $1500 less.
Personal or direct taxes per capita, as
such, will be abolished. An income tax
will be imposed. The prime feature will
be an adaptation of the single tax theory.
A Republican Charter Commission has
spent $709 in getting up a city and county
government charter draft, and will spend
$190 more. It will be absolutely of no pur- |
pose, for the legislative majority will treat \
the document as so much waste paper.
The nrinted draft is out, but even a por
tion *of the Republican press has de
nounced it already as cumbrous, inapt and
altogether unworthy of a body of intelli
gent men. â¢ â¢
With great coaxing both houses may be
induced to pass a bill for a commission to
adjudicate claims on account of plague
fires, also one to provide for the exten
sion of the fireproof limits of the city of
Honolulu.- The natives are chary of both
schemes. : .
An extraordinary petition was that re
ceived in the House from nearly 200 resi
dents of a Honolulu ward which prayed
for the abolition of ahe United States
quarantine regulations in this Territory.
It was actually accorded the courtesy of
going to a committee before finding a rest
ing place upon the table. Another hu
morous incident was the moving of an
amendment by Representative Kaniho to
a bill placing Kuardianshjp matters in the
hands of the Circuit Courts entirely to add
the words "and all persons similarly af
flicted" to the specific category of helpless
tubjects for guardlansftip. Robertson of
Honolulu sarcastically remarked that the
proposed- amendment, would not place It
any stronger In the power of the court to
provide a guardian for the mover.
The wireless telegraph Is working well
as far as Lahaina and will be to the isl
and of Hawaii whenever damage to the
station on the big island from a storm has
been repaired. Already the immense ad
vantage of instantaneous communication
has been demonstrated to business men.
Four Portuguese fishermen are thought
to have been lost while on an expedition
to Waimanalo, a small town on the
northern side of this island and about
twenty-five miles from Honolulu. They
left in a small sailboat on February 26
and nothing has since been heard from
them. â , ' ,
Among the arrivals on Wednesday,
March 6, was the American bark Star pf
I Bengal, fifty days' from Newcastle. New
South Wales, with coal. - Thirty days out
of Newcastle the coal was discovered to
be rapidly heating and nearly fifty tons
had to be thrown overboard to prevent
The whaling bark Andrew Hicks ar
rived from San -Francisco on Wednesday,
March 6. Michael Moretto. a member of
the crew, stabbed Michael Mullally, a
shipmate, a number of times In the back
during the course of a fight three days
before reaching port. The Injured man
lies at the point of death, while his as
sailant was delivered into the custody of
the United States Marshal. Frank Portu
s=ack, the first American Governor of
Guam, is a passenger on the bark for
Guam.
Mrs. Helen Wilder Craft, who has been
the head of the local Humane Society for
a number of years past, has announced
her retirement from that work on acÂ«
crfunt of poor health. With her retire
ment the Honolulu society will probably
pass out of existence for the present.

Is claimed, give the party the color of
right to carry on the business. A sa
loon-keeper doing business in Kansas
would not have the right to appeal tc
Federal troops to defend his property in

the right to call for Federal help, and
that only after all other powers at -his
command have failed.

unanimous testimony of the officers favored the plan and praised its results. At first the only com
plaint came from the rumhole keepers around the posts, whose profit had come from the debauch
ery and brutalizing- of the men. But these unworthies soon found allies in the great company of
foolish but well-meaning people who are victims of the maggot of fanaticism, and the tapeworm of
intolerance. These joined the rheumy-eyed and blearfaced keepers of the disused soakholes in de
nouncing the canteen. They attacked President McKinley about it all through the last campaign.
Their candidate for the Presidency, who himself fell upstairs Â«n Chicago under circumstances that
might have set him nailing a campaign lie about himself, made all his fight against the President
as the sponsor of .the canteen. When the army bill was before Congress the clan that believes men
can be made moral and. abstinent by statute gathered in Washington and overran the Capitol.
Members weakly yielded and voted to close the canteen and. reopen the rumhole. Then the rig
idly righteous prayed for joy, the rumseller blasphemed for joy, and the devil laughed.
Results appeared at first payday. The men in Fort Sheridan, Chicago, had been always sober
and contented in the canteen. But March payday found the canteen closed as a triumph of temper
ance and to save the soldier from a drunkard's grave. The men made a bee line from the pay
clerk to the saloon, got drunk by companies and battalions, fought each other, nearly killing sev
eral, and wrecking the wretched' holes in which they squandered their pay, their brains and their
manhood. At every army, post in the country drunkenness and bestiality prevailed, discipline was
injured, the health of the men impaired, and civilians were scandalized..
While this was going on a ministers' meeting in New Jersey was dividing its time singing
hymns of victory over, the canteen and hissing Attorney General Griggs because in a decision he
had sustained the canteen. No more pitiful exhibition of fanatical folly has ever been seen, .nor
has there been an alliance productive of more evil than this between the prohibitionist and the rum
seller. . â¢_. . â¢ _ 1 â¢' ' . . . , "' /' â Â¦ ......
AS a means of defending the enlisted men in the 'regular army against -the pitfalls and dead
falls that abound around every army post, the canteen, or post club, for enlisted men, was
devised. In it only beer and wine and light food refreshments and tobacco were sold, and
it housed a post library, wa9 a reading-room, and furnished facilities for playing chess, whist and
THE ARMY CANTEEN.
"The Call has supported this project of leasing China* Basin from . the beginning
because it was a proper and necessary step .on , the part of the State. A transcontinental rail
road was at the gates of the city and there were no facilities at hand for the transaction of its busi
ness. If the former authorities of the State and city had been more vigilant and farseeing the
means would have been provided in advance to attract such a railroad. Finding that no such pro
vision had been made, the Santa Fe Company offered to expend more than $1,000,000 upon' the
property of the State for the purpose of securing terminal privileges, of which it was in urgent need.
The wisdom and policy of granting the company the use of this property were apparent to all. The
Board of State Harbor Commissioners promptly met the situation to the extent of their powers.
Everything in connection with the business was open and well known to the public. The Mayor
of the city and the Board of Supervisors, after the fullest investigation, gave the project their un
qualified approval and support. The Legislature should have followed in their footsteps, and
would have done so but for an effort by some of its members to extort tribute from the railroad.
The efforts of the "gang" in this direction were encouraged by the publications
of the Examiner, which, haying largely antagonized the decent elements of the. Dem
ocratic party in San Francisco, seemed to find satisfaction in acting as their organ.
Among other misstatements in this connection that paper stated that the defeat of
the measure would work "a saving to the State of many thousands of dollars in dockage fees which
otherwise would never reach the treasury," when the lease contains an express stipulation that all
merchandise passing over the China Basin retaining wall shall pay to the State the same dockage
and tolls which are collected on other parts of tlie i water front, and the railroad company thereby
bound itself hot to collect or take any dues or. tolls whatever on account of the" -use of such wall.
These matters were discussed and agreed on at -puHlic, meetings of the Board of , Harbor Commis
sioners, at which representatives of the press were; present, and.' this circumstance precludes any ex
cuse or extenuation on the plea of ignorance by the which seems in this instance to have
found a pleasing affiliation with a combination of "strikers" of which Martin Kelly is a bright and
shining specimen. - /Â¦ ,: . ; â¢Â« ' ,,
THE passage by the Legislature of the bills to ratify the lease of China Basin was one of the
most important events of the session which has just closed. No serious objection was ever
raised to this lease, which is generally conceded to have been drawn io a way to amply pro
tect the interests of the State, but the "push" seemed to consider that it would be a bad precedent
to permit a railroad corporation to secure any favorable legislation without "putting up," and
they made their fight against the lease upon this time-honored theory. . l .
The vote in the Senate against the bill, commencing with "Ji m " Byrnes and ending with
"Eddie" Wolfe, dispels any possible suspicion of the use of improper means by the parties iutei>
ested in the measure. As Senator Davis well put it, the. result demonstrates .that in this State "a
railroad company can obtain just consideration of its rights without going into politics," and he
might have added "without going into its pockets." This is certainly true if the people will con
tinue to send to the Legislature such men as Senator Davis and his associates who supported the
lease. The feature of the proceeding most- to be regretted is the fact that not one-half of trie Sena
tors elected to represent the city of San Francisco voted for the bill, though at the same time all
credit and honor should be accorded to Ashe, Bettman, Nelson and Plunkett, the four who stood
by the city. Here was a measure' of greater importance to this city than any which has arisen in
years, and it was only saved from the attacks of its representatives by the integrity of the
members of both houses who weie elected from other localities. This should be a lesson to all Â»hose
who are interested in the we-fare of the place- to take better care in the future about the selection
and election of those who are to be its legislative servants.
The city members in the Assembly, led by such men as Sutro and Bauer, made
a better showing on the final vote, although some of thc-m were rather slow in declar
ing their. position. The Governor of the State is. to be commended in this connection for lending
his influence in favor of the city, and our business men will not forget it. -The Speaker of the As
sembly should also come in for their grateful remembrance and consideration. . Another gratify
ing circumstance is found in the position taken by the president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, who, we are credibly informed, gave imperative orders to all employes of that corporation
not to interfere with this legislation. Such conduct indicates a disposition to conduct the business
of his company upon bro.ad and liberal principles, ; which the people of this State will not fail to ap
preciate and admire. .
To hope for any such representations
from the commercial theater of the Unit
ed States Is quite, hopeless. 'The only
thing that has been done In this line In
our country Is by the dramatic academies
and by the universities. Harvard has
JCbbody would wish to see these old
comedies put upon. the etage exactly as
written, fcr they are nearly all marked by
a. directness of speech which is confess
edly objectionable, though not really so
demoralizing as such exhibitions as were
given In the first act of "Zaza." But this
directness â coarseness if you will â is eas
ily removed, with but slight injury to the
texture and substance of the play; this
done, there remains a body of comedic
material which can well furnish instruc
tion to modern comedy writers and enter
tainment to those among modern audi
ences who delight to know what manner
of men were our English ancestors. Here
they are. drawn far more vividly at first
hand In these plays than at second or
third hand in the pages of historians.
Now, were the educative possibilities of
the stage as well understood in this coun
try as they are in France and In Ger-,
many, adaptations of these and similar
plays would be given in every large city
that controlled, a municipal theater. Nay,
more. In the course . of three or four
years there vrould be Â» presented repre
sentative plays not only from eighteenth
century comedy but from the entire range
of the English drama â from the. medieval
mystery play down to the latest comefly
by Augustus Thomas or Pinero. The pre
sentation of eacfc play would be preceded
1>y a. lecture from some specialist eluci
dating the origins, the theme and the
characters; students of the drama would
thus obtain a- more vivid and accurate
knowledge of what the drama means and
how it came to be what It Is than ever
they can from the mere reading of the
texts. A play Is a composition -written to
V>e acted and. until it Is acted, it can nev
er produce Its full effect.
IT cannot be claimed that the eixty
years (or, to be exact, 6ixty-one)
which elapsed between the appear
er.ee of Farquhar's "The Beaux'
Stratagem" <170T). and of Goldsmith's
-The Good-natured Man" (17CS). are the
richest in the history of English comedy;
neither, on the other hand, are they the
most barren. That Infelicity may safely
be awarded to the first sixty years of the
r.lneteenih century, for during that period
no English writer turned out a comedy
of the first rank nor of the secondâ and
there was but one produced of the third
(Lytton's "Money").
To consider English comedy between
Farquhar and Goldsmith a blank is a
ir.tstaken judgment then that can be held
only by those who have never investi
gated the subject. True, no Congreve and
no Sheridan flourished within this period,
but there was more than one comedy
writer of the second rank whose dialogue
showed that he had studied his Congreve
ttiid whose construction showed that he
had studied his Moiiere. Among these
vas'Cibber, whose "Provoked Husband"
(built upon a comedy of Vanburgh's) long
held the stage; Gay. whose "Beggars'
Opera" was not excelled. In its line, by
anything done until the time of our own
OSlbert; Fielding, whose "Miser" (found
ed on Moliere'6 "L/Avare") has well been
despribt-d as having "the value of a copy
from a great painter by an eminent
hand"; Hoadley, whose "Suspicious
Husband" furniEhed Garrick with one of
his greatest parts (Ranger): Murphy,
v!:ose "All In the Wrong" is none the
less excellent because its excellence is
largely dprived from Moliere's "Sgnar
elle"; George Co'man, whose "Jealous
Wile" has supplied Ideas for a score' of
subsequent plays dealing with the theme
cf Jealousy, and lastly Garrick. who. in
conjunction with the aforesaid Colman,
wrote the best comedy cf the period un
der considerationâ "The Clandestine Mar
riace."
The above quotation, culled from the
New York press. Is an expression of
opinion by Frank Damrosch in an address
made before the Methodist Social Union
of New York. It has naturally aroused
wide and somewhat severe commenj.
Father McLoughlin. the "singing
priest." whose illustrated talks on song
literature have been so pleasant a fea-
"The quartet choir is an American In
stitution, and it is perhaps the cause of
more trouble in the church than any
other thing. I would not advise Ameri
cans to be proud of It. Not that we do
not have excellent quartets, hut the more
excellent they are the less fit they are to
be in the church. The solution to the
quartet difficulty Is the chorus. Choral
music, to my mind. Is the only music that
is fit for the church, In that it sinks the
individuality â¢ of the performer in the
mass."
In response to a large demand a week's
northern engagements have been can
celed by Carreno and she will be heard
here in three extra recitals during the
coming week at dates later to be an
nounced. â¢ 'â¢.Â¦-
A pleasing feature of the recitals has
been the nurabgr of Beethoven's works
that have been given. Mme. Carreno in
terprets this master Â¦with a peculiar.
warm sympathy. The three sonatas, op.
31, No. 3, op. 53, and op. 109, have already
been given, besides the "Andante Favori"
and the charming rondo, op. 51, No. 2.
Chopin has also been as well represented
on programmes, . with . the B minor
sonata and a couple of "etudes, nocturnes
and polonaises, with a B minor scherzo.,
which was given with splendid sweep and
color.
Sherman-Clay Hall is too small for Car
reno to be heard there to advantage. 8he
who can fill the largest halls devoted to
concert purposes Is there cribbed, cabined
and confined. At the Thursday evening
recital at the close of the colossal finale
of the "Etudes Symphoniques." given
with an electrifying energy, this was par
ticularly felt.
Carreno sings the Joys of living, the
Weltschmerz find no answering voice' In
her exultant makeup. "Life is worth liv
ing," says every note that she plays, sin
cere, wholesome and Joyous. She Is the
spirit of sunlight, as Godowsky is the
apostle of moonlight and mystery. She
has the imperious splendor of the rose, he
the elfin delicacy of the orchid. Aa his
genius is remote, fastidious, spiritual, so
ia hers brilliant, . passionate, all-compell
ing, a majestic and heroic voice In the
kingdom of the pianoforte. That these
two meet on the great common ground
that genius holds, goes without saying,
but thank' the gods that be for the differ
ences!
In all but the magnificent climaxes, in
which Carreno by right of the splendid
physical t vigor that is hers, excels, the
advantage, technically, is all on Godow
sky's side. In clarity and evenness of ex
ecution, in absolute mastery of the me
chanics of the instrument and the subtler
mysteries of tone, the latter must be
acknowledged master. But what's the dif
ference when the prevailing mood of an
audience subjugated by the Carmen of the
instrument -is thus expressed: "Hang
technic!"
That is the supreme value and unique
characteristic of the work of the great
artist, the last faithfulness to the Indi
vidual Ideal, the personal note, the pos
sessing essence: and herein lies the rate
power and charm of the world-gift of Car
reno and Godowsky. The truth as they
see it, with the clear, wide eyes of genius,
they give to us, and It is impossible to
imagine a broader outlook on "the truth
musical than Is afforded us by these two
so vitally different masters of the art of
enchantment Technically, temperament
ally, physically, psychically. between
them they run the whole gamut of differ
ence, and when the pianist in the courts
of heaven Is appointed It shall be he who
has sipped honey at Hybla Â¦with Car
reno, and sorrowed in the strange, subtle,
odorous twilights of Godowsky's genius.
IT is but seldom that we of the Far
Weft have . opportunity of hearing .
within one short month artists so op
positely attractive and so attractively
opposite as the two famous pian
ists who have come our way with
in the last four weeks, ' Mme.
Teresa Carreno and Leopold Godow
sky. As a revelation of the possibili
ties of the piano, of the almost incredible
variety of effect that can be obtained at
the command of opposing temperaments
from this inherently most irresponsive of
instruments, the Carreno and Godowsky
recitals have been an object lesson, the
worth of which it Is not easy to over
estimate and the moral of which, writ In
letters of gold. Is: "Be yourself, to the
last note, word, thread of you."
"The Idea that practicing: upon an organ
can possibly hurt it Is now quite exploded.
Eminent authorities, such aa Dr. Turpln
and others, scout the notion, and I have
heard a clever organ builder say that It
does an organ good to be well played on.
It Is said that evil Is wrought by want of
thought, and I am sure if organists re
membered that they were once young
students themselves and indebted to tha
kindness of other organists for practice,
they would not refuse to afford similar
facilities to . those to whom access to a
good organ is of the utmost Importance.
I should like, therefore, to appeal to th*
kindness and good feeling of all persons
having charge of an organ, whether
clergy, organists. churchwardens or
chapel trustees, to facilitate the access of
promising students to their Instruments,
by whom. I feel sure, such kindness wVI
be warmly I appreciated and certainly no*
abused."

The denouement of the play as original
ly written is amusing but unpresentable.
In the version to be given next Saturday.
I have therefore been obliged to cut
away this denouement and to write In
anotherâ yet one that logically follows, I
hope, the lines of the story.
Those interested In this study should
consult the "Life of Garrick" above men
tioned, my Indebtedness to which is here
by acknowledged.
After Garrick's death a furious contro
versy broke out as to the relative shares
of Colman and Garrick in the composition
of the play. Â»Into this it were unprofitable
to enter here. More interesting it is to
notice that by declining to play the part
Gf Lord Og'.ebyâ partly on account of ill
health, partly from fear of a failure â Gar
rick missed one of the greatest chances
of his life. When the play was brought
out. February 20. 1766; the part of Ogleby
was Intrusted to King, who eleven years
later was to originate Sir Peter Teazle.
Some unpopular political allusions In the
opening of the second act came near to
wrecking the piece then and there, but
King's Ogleby proved irresistible; anger
Eoon turned to laughter and the piece
went forward, with but one slight hitch,
to a successful conclusion. Many distin
guished actors â among them Farren â have
since attempted the role, but the almost
universal testimony is that none have
equaled King.
The circumstances under which this
play was written are briefly as follows:
According to the editor of Cumberland's
Eritish Theater, its origin Is to be found
In a -farce by the Rev. James Townley,
entitled "False Concord," acted at Co
vent Garden March .20. 17C4. "In this
piece," says the editor, "were three_ capi
tal charactersâ Ixjrd Lavender, a valh, su
perannuated nobleman: Mr. Sudley, a
wealthy soap boiler, and a pert .valet.
These, with the dialogue of some of the
seems nearly verbatim, were transferred
to 'The Clandestine Marriage.' " Fitzger
ald ("Life of Garrick." book 7. chapter I)
denies this. As all the authorities agree
that "False Concord" was never printed,
the statement appears incapable either of
proof or of disproof. Certain it Is, how
ever, that I*ord Ogleby bears a resem
blance to the character of Lord Chalk
stone In Garrick's farce of "Lethe," and
we have no reason to doubt the truth of
his assertion that the conception was sug
gested to him by observation of "a humor
ous old gentleman down in Norfolk." Mrs.
Heidelberg, the tempestuous, strong
minded lady of the play, who rules her
family with the rod of money, seems to
have been more .Garrick's creation than
Colman'sâ this on the authority of Can
therly, who copied out the parts for the
original production. air. Sterling, the
pompous, purse-proud city merchant, who
intends to show the aristocracy how to
eat and drink off gold, must probably be
credited chiefly to Colman, whose rougher
humor and coarser nature seem to find
their natural expression in this part.
These are the three striking characters of
the play. The others, though easily and
naturally drawn, do not vary much from
the conventional and serve chiefly to give
fuller expression to those already indi
cated.

other : committee of hold-over Senators,
this time to Investigate the question of
consumption In this State, to decide If It
be advisable to establish a hospital for
consumptives, and, If so, to select a site
for it. The resolution was put in by
Wolfe, who spoke in its favor. Smith of
Los Angeles and Caldwell of Riverside
supported It, and Belshaw, Smith of Kern
and Rowell opposed It.
Belshaw said If a hospital for consump
tives were Established in this State In a
few : weeks It would be filled with con
sumptives from all over the country.
Smith of Kern said the committee would
only go to public institutions and public
officers to obtain its information, and that
could be done by mall Just as well. Row
ell said the work of the committee would
be useless, as a Senator would not neces
sarily be a judge of the ravages of tuber-

HEART DISEASE.
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the" Amer-
icans, is | certainly, increasing:, and while
this maybe largely due to the excitement
and worry of American business life it Is
more often the result of weak stomachs,
of poor digestion. Â¦ t '
Real organic : disease ls. Incurable; .but
hot one case in a hundred of heart trouble
ls orcanlc. v ; ; Â¦â¢Â¦>Â¦Â¦â¢ -..,v, Â¦;Â¦Â¦ -
. The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion Is because both organs
are Â¦ controlled by the same ! great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric. - ;/;
In another way, also the heart ls affect-
ed by the form of poor digestion which
causes : gas and fermentation from - half
digested food. Â¦ Â¦,: There , is a feeling of ; op-
pression and heaviness in the chest caused
by Â¦ pressure of 1 the distended stomach on
the heart and lungs. Interfering with their
action; hence arises palpitation and short
breath. *Â¦' Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦'*"'Â¦.Â¦< 'J ~"t.a-i- '-Â¦Â¦,'â¢'Â¦. %'> â¢'â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦:. 1 -

IMPRISON CLERK
AND LOOT SAFE
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 18.â There
la a etrons suspicion that Harry Moran. a
wealthy young mining operator of. Cape
?CcmÂ« and son of a prominent society
woman of Chicago, has been murdered
near Cape Mudge. 150 miles from Van
couver. A. J. Hlnzey, a millionaire rail
way operator of Chicago, connected with
the Chicago and Milwaukee Railway, is
herÂ© looking up the details of the case.
Moran" s deatÂ»i was reported two weeks
s.go. He was alleged to have been
drowned with another man named Fields
Foley, with whom he had gone on a ten
days' hunting voyagi They disappeared
and their boat was found floating bottom
up. The conclusion was natural that
Moran and his companion were drowned.-
Two days ago, however, the party search-
Ing for their bodies found remains of a
cairpfire on the shore, and near* it were
blood stains. This was exactly, opposite
â¢where their boat was found, and from this
place It could easily have been set adrift.
Ehreds of clothing were found in the vicin
ity, and the party reports that there must
have been a Etruggle between the men and
whoever was responsible for their deaths.
The theory at present Is that they were
murdered and robbed by a party of In
dians, although the redskins have recent
ly shown no signs of outbreak.
Moran had a fine gold watch and several
rings. He owned considerable mining
property of Valdes Island, a short dis
tance from where the boat was found.
He was well known to the Indians. Ha
spent last year In Kome. and cleaned up
nearly 1100,000 In lucky speculations there*,
His father died some years ago, and his
widowed mother, who lives In Chicago,
has large Interests there.

panion Fall Victims

the most virulent type known .
to medical science. I had hem-
orrhages, both nasal and intes-
5tinal, eight of the latter occur-
irwr in one day. D*. Wong
Woo. the eminent Chinese phy-
sician, was called, and with one dose of til*
tea Â»topped the flotr of blood, thereby savine
my life, as I had been given up by my whin
physician, as wÂ«:i as by all my friends. Was
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. .Wong Woo'Â«
wonderful skill he saved my life from thU mrwr
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume mv
vocation In six months from the time I went to
bed. and now I weigh 202 pounds, more UÂ»anflW
had ever attained previously. I would cheeS T

NO PAIN, TRIFLING EXPENSE.
A Simple, Harmless Remedy for tho
Cure of Piles.
A person contracts . a cold, pneumonia,
rheumatism and pleurisy from exposure;'
dyspepsia and liver troubles from dietary I
errors, and the causes of most diseases
are easily traceable, but althpugh piles
and rectal troubles are as common as
any of these the cduse is obscure.' -
Violent exertion, as in lifting, sometimes
produces them, and a sedentary occupa-
tion is by some supposed to be a predis-
poBing cause, but as a rule pUes and rec-
tal troubles appear without apparent
provocation.
There are many pile salves and oint-
ments which give temporary relief and
when these fail the patient, if he can af-
ford the expense and Is willing 10 take ;
the risk, has recourse to a surgical oper- !
atlon. But there Is one remedy which i
Kives Immediate relief and the regular Â¦
use of which v:ill bring about a penr.a- i
nent cure, and that is the well-known !
Pyramid Pile Cure.. J
In long-standing cases the Pyramid has
proven to be the only cure except a dan-
gerous and exceedingly painful surgical
operation, and its advantages over =Â¦ any
kind of operation are many, as it is pain-
less, causes no Interference with dally oc-
cupation and being lnthe form of a sup-
pository is always convenient and ready
for use. .
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is an effective
combination of soothing oils and antisep-
tio acids. It contains no cocaine nor nerve
destroying opiates, and, unlike most pile
salves, contain? no bl-cbloride of meroury
nor any Injurious drug of any kind.
All druggists sell the Pyramid Pile Cure
at 60 cents for a complete treatment of
the suppositories. '

fgs^T IS but a few years since Insurance Companies
| \ insisted on a chemical analysis of the fluids of the body of
| \ applicants desiring insurance in large amounts. Now, every
| j! applicant must undergo such examination, no matter how
jgnall small the amount of ipsurance asked for. The Insurance
Companies have learned wisdom by. experience. They know for a
certainty that the only sure way of detecting Bright's disease in its
i first stage is by a chemical analysis and they govern themselves ac-
cordingly. Many men applying for insurance and finding them-
selves rejected are dumfounded when told that they have kidney
'disease. Why? Because they look and feel well, suffer no pain,
and have a good appetite. But the unerring microscope in the.
hands of the intelligent physician has unmistakably shown the be-
ginning of the end, unless repaired, of the breaking down of the deli-
cate tissues of the kidneys. Happily, if taken in time, there is a
cure for kidney disease. We say this with entire confidence, be-
cause thousands have so testified, and hundreds have obtained life
insurance following a course of Warner's Safe Cure, after having
previously been rejected because of incipient Bright's disease. Men,
do not leave your dear ones dependent through your own careless-
ness! /.Â»

AD VZBTISEMiaTTa.when az 10 o'clock to-night the capitol
doors were finally closed and the people
to'.d that no more could enter the^e were
Feverai thousand more waiting patiently
In line. The body lay in state from 1:10
o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at
night, and not once during the hours was
there a break or halt in the lines which
paxsed rapidly on the right and left of
the casket.
It was Indiana's day with her dead, and
most touchingly was the esteem and
honor in which General Harrison was
held by his fellow citizens revealed. In
front of the Harrison hojne, along the
streets through which the remains were
carried on their way to and from the
State House, in. the lines that stretched
at times a half mile from the doors of
the capitol, men, women and children
stood for hours waiting: their opportunity
to pay a tribute of respect to the dead.
It was an immense throng, but one more
easily handled, or rather one that re
quired less handling, never gathered any
where. There was no jostling, no -dis
order, no disturbance of any kind. Xot a
single objectionable feature marred the
<lay.
At a Quarter tÂ» 12 General McKee or
dered 2530 infantrymen standing at '"at
tention" on born sides of the street to
present arms, and in the reverential hush
Â¦â¢which ensued the casket was . carried
from the house and placed in the funeral
car. Six sergeants from the Second
Regiment of the State Militia and
two sergeants from the Indianapolis
Light Artillery carried the casket. Ad
miral George Brown, Representing the
navy. General Lew Wallace, representing
the army, and Judge Baker and Judge
I>owling formed an escort of honor which
followed the pallbearers from the resi
dence to the hearse.
The aged survivors of the Seventieth
Reriment marched to their place of honor
behind the hearse, and when the old, bent
eoldiers of the civil war saw the black
covered casket holding the body of their
old friend and leader borne to the hearse
many of them were a/Tecte"d to tears.
The Bar Association and the clubs
marched by with uncovered heads and
took up their places in the procession-
In marked contrast to the military and
other display of to-day by which the
State of Indiana paid its last tribute of
honor to General Harrison will be the
funeral service to-morrow afternoon at
the First Presbyterian Church. The rites
Â¦will be simple, dignified and unostenta
tious.

During that time fully fifty thousand
persons passed by the coffin to take a
last look at the distinguished dead, and

he -would 'prefer to make no definite state

He said, however, that the delegates were

taken. Referring again to the possibility
of a strike, he said: "Â¦'Â¦' '-Â¦Â¦'Â¦

land owned by the Northern Pacific weÂ«t
of the Missouri River. The purchase price
ls given at $40,000,000, and it is understood
that this sum will .be used to retire pre
ferred 'Stock. ' ..
The purchasers of this land are tfiid to
be Eastern capitalists, who bave penected
a syndicate and who will undertake to en
courage .settlement and" cultivation of the
lanu by Eastern farmers, such as are now
â¢heading westward In the home seekers'
movement each week.
President Mellen has always been dis
posed to Bell this land, as several millions
of acres have already been disposed of,
but cculd not find a purchaser with.suf
nclent capital to take the whole amount.
The retirement of the Northern Pacific
preferred stock, much of which is in the
hands of the stockholders of the old or
ganization with funds thus realized, will
have the effect of creating, a handsome
surplus of earnings over the present div

found Grape-Nuts Food it solved the
problem, and elnce_ taking on this fooo

WHILE attempting to reach
shore near Drakes Bay In a
small boat Friday afternoon
from the British' sealing ves
sel Enterprise two sailors,
Leonard Barr and Frank Irvine, were
drowned in full sight of their companions,
who were powerless to render them any
assistance. The accident occurred at the
entrance to the bay, where the Â«ea was
rolling high and the breakers were beat
ing with tremendous force , against tho
rocks on the beach. -:
The two unfortunate sailors 'had been
granted a short leave of Â¦ absence by the
captain and had determined to enjoy it
on shore. Despite the admonitions of their
companions that landing was too hazard
ous* to be attempted in a small boat, they
put off from the .ship,- accompanied by
another sealer. The swell carried their
boat from the entrance of the bay into tho
breakers. Almost in an instant the frail
craft was dashed to splinters on the jag-,
ged .rocks which line the beach at that
point. i
"When Captain Gullin of the Enterprise
saw the plight of his men he ordered a'
boat to be lowered, but before It reached,
the scene Leonard Barr had been fatally
injured by being: dashed against the rocks
and Frank Irvine had been drowned and
his body washed to sea by the swirling
tide. Their companion, who is an'excel
lent swimmer, managed tÂ«J keep himself,
afloat and free from *he breakers until
the arrival of the rescue boat. Every
thing possible was done to resuscitate
Barr, but without avail.- He succumbed
to his injuries in a few minutes after he
was picked up.

PATRIOTIC IRISHMEN ARE PREPARING
FOR A GRAND CELEBRATION IN HONOR
OF THE PATRON SAINT OF ERIN
The pawnshop and clothing store of N.
K- Herzoc. on Lyons street, near Green
wich, was wrecked last night by a mob of
nearly 10D0 drunken soldiers. Fully 1000
men stood in front of the store, and threw
Ftone after stone throush 'the windows.
Besides the rock?, the drunken troopers
hurled all sorts of expletives at the pro
prietors.
There were but three policemen on duty
and they were powerless. They tele
phoned for reinforcements and two patrol
wagons loaded with bluecoats were sent
to the scene, but even this force was un
able to control the drunken mob of sol
diers.
Word was finally sent to Colonel Rawles,
Â¦who ordered out a company of the Eight
eenth Infantry. Upon tfce arrival of Â»ne
detachment fully armed and ready for
business the rookies and volunteers com
prising: the mob. began to sneak away.
The riotous soldiers were ordered to
Quarters, and though surly and still de
fiant, respect, for the men of the Eigh
teenth compelled the liquor-crazed sol
diers, to obey. The saloons found in the
Immediate neighborhood were searched
and every soldier without a pass sent
within the reservation under guard.
The cause of the riot was a story
Fpready by a discharged soldier that he
had been cheated by the proprietor of the
6tore. The man w.is a member of the
Thirty-Fixth Infantry and left for the
Hast before the riot commenced. The
Â«=tory of the supposed cheating: was
bandied about among the soldiers until
it grew to mammoth proportions. The
men had plenty of money to buy liquor
end as their minds became inflamed they
gradually worked themselves Into a
cowartllv rape. %
N. K. Herzog-, proprietor of the pawn
shop and clothing 1 store which was
wrecked, tells the loliowins etory of the
trouble:
"A soldier came into my store about 3
;?Â» m. yesterday and took out a suit of
elotkgs pawned by a comrade. He had
the tKi.^i *;.â¢- I grave him the clothes. He
j>aid me wittra^J-O gold piece and I hand
t-d him back Sis. 4\Â« xook his change and
walked out of the store while I went to
wait on another customer. In about an
hour he returned and claimed that I 'had
Jailed to give toim his change. He said h-j
Mas going to leave on the evening train
tnd wanted the money.
"I told Kim he had received his proper
chanpe. He then went out and brought
in Sergeant of Police Campbell. He told
tho fergeant.he was a little bit drunk, but
knew what he was doing. He went away,
and I forgot about tlfe matter until about
7 o'clock I noticed the soldiers gathering
s round my Ftore. Fully 1W9 soldiers were
in front of my place, yelling and calling
me all ports of names. I called for the po
lice, livt the force sent out was powerless.
I then telephoned to Colonel Rawles. He
fnt a company of Infantry and the men
r.pre dkr^rs^d. but not until every win
dow in my Ftor*Â» wss broken and the floor
covered with rockÂ«."

An attempt was. made by soms mis
creant yesterday morning to destroy by
flre thÂ»Â» orsran In St. Dominic's Church
on the corner of Bush and 8telner streets.
Patrick Kearney, sexton of the church,
discovered the flre before it had gained
any considerable headway and extin
guished it. But for this timely discovery
the organ, which la valued at $23,000. would
have been irreparably damaged.
That the flre was of incendiary origin
is admitted by the police and flrÂ© of3cials.
They have centered upon a' former mem
ber of the choir, as the Incendiary, but
the necessary evidence to warrant his ar
rest is lacking. . He says that. he .was not
within many blocks of the church at tha
time the fire, was discovered and has to
some' extent proved an alibi. Should It bÂ«
found, however, that he was In the neigh
borhood of the edifice- prior to tha discov
ery of the flre he will bÂ« given an <Â«|or
tunity to establish an alibi In court.^*
Kearney, who has been employed as lex
ton for the last two years; opened tha
door leading to the choir gallery about
8:30 o'clock yesterday morning, as a sol
emn high requiem mass was to be cele
brated for one of the parishioners. HÂ»
then went out to sweep off tho sidewalk.
This duty being attended to. Kearney
wenjt back to the organ loft to ascertain
if everything was in order. It was then
that he discovered the flre, â¢ .'-
Discovery of the Fire.
Â¦"When I threw open the door leadmc
to the choir gallery." said Kearney yes
terday afternoon, "I found that tho wood
en partition surrounding the organ bel
lows was on flre. -For a minute I waa
dazed. Then I realized that prompt ac
tion was necessary. I pulled off my coat
and used it to beat out the flames. I suc
ceeded in putting out the flre. but I was
not a minute too soon. Had thÂ» flre
reached the bellows it would have rapidly
run through the wooden air pipe leading
to the organ and you can imagine the- re
sult.
"I am positive that the flre was of In
cendiary origin. I think that I could glvÂ»
the name of the man who started it. WÂ©
have had trouble in the choir, and I am
satisfied that a discharged member start
ed the flre. I did not see him around tho
church, but he has fox a time been threat
ening that he would have revenge. He
knew just where a flre started would first
reach the organ and destroy It. We are
to have a special musical service to-mor
row and I think that he planned to pre
vent it."
Police Theories.
The proof that the flre was of Incendiary
origin Is Indisputable. The organ, -which
was built in New York- two years ago at
a cost of J25.000.l3 situated In the gallery
in th(Â» rear i>art of the church. It Is
reached through a side door that Is only
opened for Jhe members of the choir. The
bellows are on the ground floor" and axa
protected "by a wooden partition : that
reaches, from the floor to the gallery. A
door cut In the partition leads Into tha
bellows room. The key of It Is In the pos
session of the sexton. One end of the bel
lows is not twelve Inches away from the
door. The door leading to this room was
locked yesterday morning Â¦: when the en
trance to the choir loft -was opened. "When
the. fire was discovered by Kearney, the
door of the bellows-room was on flre- and
a hole ab'vit six Inches In diameter had
been burned under the lock. That the fire
did not start from the floor fs evidenced
by the fact that the- wood twelve Inches
above the floor Is intact, while the upper
part of the door and partition are burned
and charred.
The theories advanced by the police aro
that the firebug either sprinkled the upper
part of the door with oil and then applied
a match, or else tied a bundle of some In
flammable material to the doorknob and
set It on flre. The evident Idea of the per
son who started the- blaze was to reach
the bellows, then have the flames shoot
up throuch the air pipe and thus reach
the organ. Had the organ- been destroyed
the tire would have there ended, ' for the
church is built of brick and stone and
nothing else but tho gallery could have
been destroyed.

came Rolling Boer., Onnmoro and Joe
Frey. .Thundering past the BtandÂ» ana

to be 'in a pocket from which Sloan could
not extricate -hira. Down the back stretch

Frey; freed and In a good plnce, took a
natural lead. Then came tlie finish. Sloan,
O'Connor and Burns drove hard, but U
was clearly Joe Frev's race. O Cohnor's
clever riding won him the place on Biu

Burns did not cover .himself with any
particular kind of glory by liis ride; allow
ing himself to be worked out in his at
tempt to catch Articulate on the flrat turn.
The race over, J7 Tod hunter In smiling
fashion received the applause for his ond
and a quarter mile uffort on the wlnntr
and Johnny Schorr smiled as he thought
of the $5000 added money which all went
to his box in the sale. Now no one
doubts that Joe Frey Is the best colt hi
California. The race waa run in 2:07)4.
Then came the mile and a sixteenth spe

Guard led all the wav. Burns cutting: out
a slew pace at' first. vbut wisely accelerat
ing it as p oon as the back stretch wfrs
reached. Sloan laid in* Walt. That waa
all he did, never being Â¦' in a position
fraught with dangef to Advance GUard.
Burns received a mighty applausa for his
ride, for he was on the 10 to 9 priced horao.
Tuthlll was 4 to 5. The distance was cov
ered in 1:47M.. '
On a fast track Fondo scored the re-'
opening 1 victory, due to the clever tidin?
Â¦of O'Connor. Burns had tne mount on the
favorite. Nellie Forest, which led untfl

"What . proved Â¦ the most excitine flnlsh
of the day was the steeplechase event
over a two and a, half milo course. Peri

second choice. Mest'or, the winner, was
the third In the bettlnsr. -..After a mile of
jumping, sharp turning and field running
Periwig fell, injuring his rider, leaving
May Boy, as was thought at that time,
tho sure winner. But'Alcstor was in the
race and in it to stay. Closing in on Alay
Boy when the- last barrier -was taken
Mestor and May Boy were neck and ne'ik.
Down the stretch they came and It was a
toss which would win. Mestor pot the
judges* verdict and it- was a nose that
proved the saving grace Periwig looked
tho winner until the fall. The Californlail
got a far-away show.
The last race, a bIx furloner event for
four- year-olds, was Â¦won by The Pride,
the favorite. Specific, with Burns : up.

The long chase after the rich $3000 pr>xc
absorbed all attention and the crow'i
fretted like a high-strutig racer crunch
ing on the bit until it was calledâ fourth
on the card. His impressive win of the
two mile number earlier In the weex
caused Locochee to issue from his wir

favorite. The Bobby, wiin the rising light

6:55% and finished out Iwenty-ilve lengths*

most commendable performance. Bangor
did not sulk, but found the distance too
far. The winner did not eeem noticeab'v
distressed, for he at first kicked when

"Whitehat" McCarty's colors flashed

borne by Matilda O. a 10 to 1 shot, piloted
by Mounce. The mare -was well played,
and moving along from seventh position
beat Gold Beater two le'ngths. Compan

showing some early speed.
At last, after several unsuccessful es
says. Flora Pomona left the maiden class
in the two-year-old spin. A 2 to 5 chance,

Estado and Barklyite. â¢Â»
With Hagerdon scratched from the

doesn't look good, and never seriously
overburdened with speed; ran fifth. Look

Benroe was nabbed and downed a head
by Satan; a 10 to 1 shot, with E. Matthews
up. Alturas came from far back, finish
ing a close third.
Five fast ones met In' the fifth event,
causing some merry plunging. Mofince
had .the leg up on The Light, and a world
of coin finally sent the mare to the post
a slight favorite over Loving Cup. -She
received excellent handling and In a fierce
drive got the decision over the latter by
half a length. Meehanus ran as if short,
for after looking a possible winner In the
stretch he quit, losing the show to Tame
Irishman. LoVlng'Cup was pocketed on
the stretch turn or she would have cer
tainly won.
Frank McMahon's semi-annual winner
Stromo concluded the afternoon's enter
tainment by taking the last race, over
one mile and a furlong, at odds of 15 and
20 to 1. Always well up in the bunch, the
big gelding stood a hard drive, defeating

would have scored except for an Inclina

Bvery preparation had been mada at In
gleside for a week or two of roclnz and
some *S0CO expended In preparing: the track
and renovating: the stands. Horses wer*
shipped from .Tanforan and now will bo
shipped back at the expense of the ano
.elation, and racing will be resumed on
Monday at that park.
But there is a grave Question whether
racing and bookmaklng can be .legally
carried on at Tanforan before Tuesday.
The ordinance allowing the resumption
of raclns was passed on March 4 and Its
date to eo Into effect was set for fifteen
days later. This would make Tuesday tbe
opening day, according to the law.
That horsemen wore greatly surprised
at. the result is expressed by the remarks
of President Thomas H. William* Jr. of
the California Jockey Club:
"I do not know anything about tho
veto." said Mr. Williams last nlzht. "I
do not know whether Mayor Phelan had*
any Intention of vetoing the ordinance or
not. as I never spoke to Mr. Phelaa about
the matter.
"Regarding 1 the rumors that I had pur

offer was declined. With the Prince I am

"Will the vetoing change your plans?"
was asked.
"Not a particle." Mr. Williams replied.
"If Mayor Phelan has vetoed the ordi

names Raze a Half -Block of Chinri-
town Shacks.
BAKERSFIfcLD. March 16.â A' half
block in Chinatown on the north side of
Twentietn streot,. between IT and L, was
destroyed by fire this evening. The esti
mated loss is $15,000. Alt were low frame
buildings, except a one-story brick. "There
was no insurance on the property.
The main wires from the Kern River
Cannon electric power plant passed close
to the burning distrlct-and communication
was broken. The city was In. darkness to
night and no street cara moved.
PERHAPS no official act. of Mayor
Phelan caused greater discussion
than the announcement made yes
terday afternoon at a late hour
; that he had Vetoed the ordinance
introduced by Supervisor Tdbln legalizing
bookmaking and pool selling on races for
a period of thirty-six days each year at
Ingleslde track.
One element of surprise was the secrecy
maintained by the Mayor as to his Inten
tions. While the measure was known as
the Tobin ordinance, it was generally con
sidered the Mayor's pet scheme. At a
meeting called at [nil request and over
r.'hich he presided some months ago, he
plainly expressed himself in favor of rac
ing fur a limited season with pool selling
privileges within the racetrack lnclosure
thrown ' in. The introduction of nn ordi
nance embodying > these views followed
and reached the Mayor's hand in due
course ef time.
After having the matter under con
sideration for ten days, the limit allowed
him by law to approve or disapprove the
ordinance, with but an hour and a half of
the statutory time remaining, he trans
niitted two scaled messages to ths Board
of Supervisors. Clerk McKcnna was on
Hand to receive them and noted their fil
ing at 10:UO p. m, en Friday night.
â¢ Later in the evening Mayor Phelan was
Closeted with Prince Poniatowskl until a
late hour, but gave no Inkling of his de
termination in the matter. As. no news
of the veto having been filed was obtain
able it was presumed that the Mayor had
faired to exercise his prerogative and
that he allow i-il the ordinance to go into
effect without his signature.
Acting on this assumption Ingleslde
track was opened up yesterday afternoon
and racing and bookmaking Went on.
About 3 o'clock Mayor Phelan telephoned
to Chief of Police Sullivan announcing his
veto of the racing ordinance and order
ing Mm to close Insleslde. The Chief im
mediately telephoned to Lieutenant An
derson, In charge of -the Mission station,
and ordered him to at once, proceed to the
track and formally notify Prince Ponia*
tOwski that bookmaklng on horse races
would not be tolerated at the Ingteside
track.
The last race was about to be run ami
the Prince pleaded with the officer not to
Interfere, as he claimed that considerable
confusion would result in case Anderson
prevented the race. Poniatowskl was,
however, willing that several bookmakers
should be arrested In order to make a
test case.
Lieutenant Anderson, despite the specific
order of the head of the Police Depart
ment, contented himself with â¢ arresting
three bookmakers' clerks, charged wltli
violating the racetrack ordinance. They
gave their names as Harry Gorman, Ed
ward Bert and W. H. Knill. Scarcely
had they been booked at the City Prison
when they were released on $50 cash ball
each. ..
Mayor Phelan remained awav from hl9
office all day, but later gave out the fol
lowing as. the text of his message:
. March 13. 1901.
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors-
Gentlemen} 1 herewith return to you without
my approval bill So. 313, providing for book
making and pooUelllntf en Contests betwejr
-horsvB or dogs - within the enclosures of race
tracks for a period of thirty-six days each year
In tLla city and county. Â¦â¢
. The reasons for my objections are as follows:
I "have delayed action on this bill because the
Legldlature' Is considering a measure for tha
limitation of racing in each county of the State
to forty days, and because the managers of
rival tracks have been negotiating among them
selves with a ttew of voluntarily limiting tho
t-eason. As I believe in a limited racing sea
son. I gave and have given encouragement to
these movement*, both of . which have failed.
The Legislature has refused to act and tho
managers of Emeryville track show no Inclina
tion to compromise. Â¦ The managers of Tan
foran are willing to accept a limited season,
but they are powerlesa .*o "lofts? as the other
track-holds out. Therefore. San Francisco Is
Inflicted with this avll and cannot reduce It or
shake it oft. â¢ "
i fall to eM how the opening of Inglesldff
relieves the situation. Fan Francisco has now
more racing than any other community in the
world. Every foreign country an.t every lead-
Ing State in the Union, with perhaps the sin
gle exception of California, hdfe. after bitter
experience with the evils of gambling, limited
the season. The Empire State haj forty day*
running racing all told within Its limits, and
the events are distributed among the several
tracks by a commission authorized by law, and
even then bookmaklng and poolselling are for
bidden and an irregular handbÂ«X)tfmaking Is
tdlerated, which apparently is suCHcient to sua
taln racing and at the name time measurably
protect the public. "When you passed thi3 bill
Tanforan had only thlrty-sfx racing days.
In my inaugural message to your honorable
body I condemned public gambling as a great
evil and 1 do not believe now in unnÂ«Â»<ressarily
extending its field. If by opening Ingleslde for
thirty-six days we could reduce the season one
half or close the other tracks, something woull
be gained.' Nothing is gained by this proposN
tlon except to make gambling more attractive
to the people of Fan Francisco.
Now, if the peoi>le of San Francisco want to

na of the Episcopalian order of Sis
ters of the Good Shepherd, and who
is widely kn8wÂ» in the diocese -of
California for the eminent ability
and success with which she has conducted
some of the more prominent of the philan
thropies of the church, is compelled by.
.physical weakness to retire from all fur
ther connection with the charities to
which she has devoted the later years of
her life, will be received with regret by
thousands of people. On the first of next
month Sister Anna will leave for Hono
lulu, hopins in that more genial clime and
under the ministration of loving relatives
to regain at least a portion of the strength
that has been to greatly impaired by her
exertions.
It is hardly possible that among the
Â¦members of her own church there Is a
woman better known or beloved than Sis
ter Anna. For fifteen years she has ex-
erclsed her wonderful powers for the good
of others, She first became known
through her connection with the Armltag-e
Orphanage at San Mateo. That institution
from its foundation grew quickly to large
proportions. At first girls and boys were
cared for. but it soon became apparent
that- two such institutions were necessary
if the work was to be adequately per
formed. It was decided to open an or-
all responsibility to other sisters, who will
take up the work where it Is left and en
large as its growing wants will permit.
Sister Anna will be tenderly remembered
by thousands of young women,- to whom
her life, example and counsel have been
of much value. Should the climate of
Honolulu prove to be beneficial it is net
probable that Sister Anna will ever re
turn to California. . . - !^Â£sÂ»*e?jji

the accommodations of the first home, and
a removal was made to a large mansion

increasing resources justified the erection

Edouard Ahnne, a professor of the
school department of Tahiti, is a guest at
the Occidental for a few days before Jour
neying to Paris. He said yesterday that
business at the '.sland was never in a more
prosperous condition. It is owing, he says,
to the regular line of steamers plying be
tween San.Francisco and Tahiti, that has
been established "by the Oceanic Steamship
Company.
"There are grand prospects for Tahiti,"
said Professor Ahnne." "The people are
all anxious to nee the subsidy bill passed.
We have now e. Eplendid mail service.*.
"Governor Petit, who has recently, been
placed In charge of the island, by the
French Government, although there but a

lar. How long he will; remain is a con
jecture. Those who are in close touch with
French Government affairs claim' that ( he
will not Â¦ stay *ong. but will ; be recalled,
and ex-Governor Galiet will again be sent
out. The grounds for this. rumor are, on
account of, Gallet's present visit to Paris,
where, it Is said, he is using every influ
ence possible to be reinstated. - ,. Â¦ r
"Merchants of . San Francisco should
'arouÂ«Â», themselves u^ the importance = of

ment roll will be Increased by $29,000,000.
He is also of the opinion that property
values should be increased at least 6 per
cent owing to the heaJthy condition of
real estate. Assessor Dodge made appli
cation to the Supervisors last year for
extra deputies in order to Increase the
roll, but his request was denied. He has
not xn&de up his mind to petition ag-ain,

Association . of the Independent Order of
Foresters, _ held last Tuesday night, it was
decided to' give a grand entertainment in
Odd Fellows' Hall on the night of the 6th
of April.. A committee, on entertainment
Â¦was appointed and sub-committees were
named to assist the general body. . It is
the purpose of the association; to make
this the best of the kind and after the
programme -there will be dancing until a
late hour. All the courts of the order iu
this city will be enlisted >tn the ca-se
and. every effort will oe made to make it
a most attractive show. . . v ; ;
Court Diana at ' Its ' meeting 'Â¦ on last
Thursday night received two applications
and was visited by several of the members
of the Past Chief Rangers' Association.
This court is one of the wide awake courts
of the order and is continually adding to
.Its membership. â¢ . '
At a meeting of the Past Chief Rangers'
Association last week the statement was
made that Court Yerba Buena had been
notified by the high chief ranger to make
arrangements to tender a reception on the
"This conflict, .which is exciting such
deep interest in the church in the United
States, iswithout precedent in the whole
history of tlue. church. An attack upon
the prerogatives 'â¢ of bishops Is a danger
ous .proceeding end cannot be permitted,
yet. the alternative -Is presented of a de

who. Is hostile to everything American

"During the entire administration of
the present -Bishop -of Hawaii- there' has
been a conflict between the Bishops on
one hand and the. priests and laity on the
other. The Bishop Is an autocrat in ec
clesiastical matters,- stubborn to the last
degree and exceedingly â¢ opinionated. The
Bishop is independent of the laity as far
as salary is concerned and has managed
to acquire title to all the property, of the
diocese. The people "have, nothing what
ever to say and only â¢ a I small elements
ever attend church. Bishop Willis has
incurred the hostility of 'the wealthy
American element by persistent opposi
tion to annexation^ â¢ .;â¢ . ;- . ,
"There would-be no difliculty whatever
of Bishop Willis of Hawaii would resign
and transfer the valuable property of the
Hawaiian diocese to the - American
church, and allow that' organization to
determine its-future. Bishop Willis is. It
is said, averse to any proposition that
does not -carry with it his continuance in
office. In him vests the title to all the
church property which, he claims, be
longs to the English church, held by htm
in trust.. The prospect of a long and bit
ter litigation is. one that meets with no
favor in the American church and will
not be permitted. Bishop -Willis Is aged
and will, r.ot live many years Monger,' and
then an amicable' settlement can be eas
ily arrived; at by. the British and' Ameri
can prelates.-- - -Â¦."...
"Bishop Potter, on a recent'vlsit'to Ha
waii, could not promise to continue the
present diocesan " organization of the
islands. There are. only about, 1000 mem
bers in the while territory and as there
is no prospect |f an increase, manifestly
a bishop must be supported by our own
church, which is not disposed to em
bark upon an unnecessary enterprise.
"One of the most 'embarrassing ques
tions that will come before the triennial
convention of the Episcopal church in
October next wifl- be the settlement of
future relations to the church in the
United States. Heretofore the church in
the islands has been fostered and sup
ported by the a. T. G.; the great mission
ary society of the ..Anglican church,
which turnished u bishop and has con
tributed largely; to j. the temporalities of
the'tuistant uiueese, whose was
subject only to the Archbishop of Canter
bury. Since the annexation the English
society has relinquished 'ail authority und
withdrawn its i contriuutlons, I for the rea
son that it has no right or. disposition to
exercise jurisdiction' in what /is beyond
doubt American territory. r The future
existence -of the diocese of Hawaii there
fore depends entirely upon the action of
the church in the UnLed States at the
convention. . ' ' . *Â¦
Rev. George Wallace, late of' San Ma
teo and for several years chaplain to the
Biishop of Hawaii, t-peaking of the
trouble in the islands says:
The conflict, in the Episcopal or English
church -in the Hawaiian Islands,' which
has ; been; waged with varying Intensity
for'--the-last .quarter, of - a" century, .has
received - a fresh . impetus, I and Â¦Â¦ s. deter
mined effort is being made by the Ameri
can element to . get | rid of the English
Bishop Willis and secure either, an Ameri
can as his successor or at least .the pro
tection of the, American branch of the
Episcopal church.

There are two things you will always remember
1 if you go East via Denver and the Burlington
Route. One is the scenery in Colorado. The
other is the whirlwind ride across Nebraska,
Iowa arid Illinois aboard the Chicago Special- â
the Burlington's famous "one night on the road"
train from Denver to Chicago. It makes the
run of 1046 miles in .27^ hours; carries a through
sleeper^ for Chicago, which leaves San. Francisco \

CHICAGO, March 18. â Liverpool cables came
ns a disappointment and as Northwest receipts
were liberal, May opened %Â©Hc lower at 76^40
76&e. Seasonable weather was a contributory
bearish factor, accounting for considerable of
the outside selling early. Buying by St. Louis
Interests through half a dozen; local houses
checked the decline and caused a, quick rally
to 76 l ;j 1 c. . Loncs sold â¢liberally, and this, to-
I gether with pressure from bears, caused a re
| action to 76ViÂ®76%c during the first hour. The
St. IkwIs buying continued and as the cash de
mand was reported good and considerable ap
prehension was felt over the tone. of the cables
concerning the difficulty between England and
Russia, the market turned bullish: May climbed
rapidly up to 77%c, closing %o higher at 77Hc".
Corn was a 'fairly active market. The open-
I ing was easier in sympathy with wheat and
I fastness at Liverpool, but j turned strong with .

XEW TORK STOCK UST.
grades has continued broad and active during
the past week. The special feature of thÂ»
week has been the activity of the stocks of
small rallrpad companies, some' of which are
not seen in the record of the Stock Exchange
transactions for many, weeks at a time. There
can be no doubt that* in many caves this' buy
ing Is In the Interest of the large railroad
ej stems, with a \iew to absorption or control.
There are continued operations also looking: to
extension of community of Interest among the
larger railroad systems themselves. Buying
of this Character has given rise to the forma
tion of speculative, pools in the stocks where
if was evident, and these pools have helped on
the rise by manipulation and by exaggeration
of current rumors retarding the properties.
The occasional realizing of speculative profits
has caused an Irregular movement 'Of prices.
The prevalent tendency toward absorption of
the minor railroad systems has attracted spec
ulative pools to operate In that class of stock"
also and has made the public credulous. of Â«11
rumors regarding consolidations, tome of which
prove unfounded. In some cases there is a
contest a*Â»1r>t change* of control and the com
petltiva bidding In the open market for the
floating supply makes high prices. It Is now
a matter of history that efforts to obtain con
trol of St. Paul were frustrated by Insiders
and the price of that stock has not been main
tained at the high level reached during the
competition. In spite of stock privileges and
an increased dividend to stockholders. The
recent activity and, strength in Burlington has
given rise to the belief that other railroad
Interests Â¦were buying the stock and Inside in
terests are said to haveV extended their hold-
Ings, with a vtew to keeping an Independent
control of the property. There has been a
large additional absorption of Baltimore and
Ohio in the Interest of Pennsylvania, with a
view to the more perfect control or that prop
erty. Indications point to the progress of a plan
for consolidations among Southwestern rail
road properties and the public expression by
the president of the Missouri Pacific of his ex
pectation of further merger? has added to the
general belief. Of general conditions the
large earnings reported have been a strength
ening Influence en railroad stocks. This has
been especially true of Southwestern railroads,
many of which have enjoyed a double advance
from last year's cotton market and the large
â¢x-heat crop In their territory, compared with
the shortage In the spring wheat region. The
tidewater bituminous coal carriers have been
uniformly strong on account of notice given
of an Increase of freight rates -on soft coal
I en April 1 and the large traffic In anticipa
tion of -the advance. The active Iron market
has been a factor In the underlying strength
nf the etock market, the output of plgiron hav
ing risen to tha flrura of the recent boom
period and consumption still running ahead
of production. The steel stocks themselves
have not responded to these conditions, but
have been dull and rather heavy. . The pro
cess of exchange of tha old securities Into
those -of the new corporation has hampered
transactions In the stocks. The restricted
nnerations on th.e curb In the new United
States Steel Corporation stocks when - Issued
are not regarded as sufficiently bread to fix
the market status of thcee stocks and their
â¢dm'.ssion to tha Stock Exchange Is awalttd
to give better opportunity for Judgment. Opin
ions on the money market outlook have been
very conflicting, but the continued low rate
for money has kept any apprehension over the
ft'tnre quiet
There has been a rery Â¦ active demand for
railroad bonds during the week. Southwestern
railway Issue** and low-gTade speculative mort
gage* have been most largely dealt In.
New 4s advanced 4 and the refunding 2s,

CLOSING
NEW YORK, March 16.â The I Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was narrow on the Stock Exchange
to-day and prices were Weak on reports of
friction at Peking Kstween the -British and the
Russian troops. All stocks were Influenced by
this. Even the American department felt the
effect of ft and waÂ« weak In sympathy with
our stocks, closing down an average of "j, of
a point below parity. Illinois Central was an
exception, closing up 3>4 points, or half a point
above parity. Money was easier. .Silver was
steady. .
London Market.
The Financier says: A. decrease of nearly
$4.OG0.00O In the loans of New Tork clearlne
houte banks tor the week ending- March 1Â«
enabled the institutions to withstand a loss
of (2.150,400 In cash holdings .at the expense
of less than three-quarters of a million dol
lars' In surplus reserve. This was brought
about by a reduction In required reserve, duo
to lessened deposit liabilities'. The statement,
theoretically, is a good one, for the season
that the loss of cash which the banks are re
porting is not making- serious lnrcads on their
exceea holdlnrs.- Carried to a logical conclu
sion, the eanie operation may be repeated In
definlte>y. but whether the loan Item can be
decreased without some disturbance is another
matter. The chief factor in the situation at
present Is the continued absorption of bank
funds by the Sub-Treasury. The remittances
from the Interior counteract the average shlp
mentS'to country Institutions. The Immediate
future, therefore, so far as cash is concerned,
rests on the transactions between . the banks
and the Treasury. A year ago the surplus re
serve touched Its lowest ebb and the quick re
cover}' was due in large part to disbursements
from Washington on bond refunding account. 1
Now, however, there is nothing of this char
acter to look forward to, although as a mat
ter of fact the .Treasury pension disbursements
now beginning will in all probability, turn the
tide In favor of the banks over the remainder
of the month. These- payments will run well
toward eight or ten million dollars. It Is also
true that the Heavy losses which the banks
have been sustaining on Treasury operations
of late have been due to Internal revenue pay
ments .which came through the. banks as an
excess over the average carried by interior de
positories and also on account of bank redemp
tion remittances made through New York cor
respondents for Inland banks. With these facts
In . mind there appears to be no cause, for
anxiety touching the future. The pending- Im
portant steel combination will probably work
changes In the situation, but even here prep
arations already made may minimize adverse
Influences. The payment of over twenty-flvÂ«
millions in dividends In the last week on ac
count of large corporations did not disturb the
money market in the least.

Â«AN* FRAXCISCO, CAU TOCalifornia could count upon the Chicago
Commercial Club to lend all assistance in
its power ln that direction.
The Pacific Coast ha*i all the ca.pacity
for frultfulness of the Garden of
Eden. Mr. Bartlett said. The eyes
of the world were upon her. The
Chieapoans were protid to be citi
zens of a country in which San Fran
cisco was Included. They hoped for the
President . Fuller on Chicago.
President Puller of the Chicago Com
mercial Club was the next speaker. He
rÂ«seponded to ! the toast "Chicago." He
rpoke very briefly. It was quite dimc-lt,
be 6aid, ta express his feelings. In be
fcalf of the Chicago Commercial Club and
Of its guests he returned thanks for the
kind words of greeting and for the royal
welcome which had met them throughout
California. In their brief stay they had
been made to feel entirely at home. The
Chicago Commercial Club was an organ
ization of business men. who were "doing
their best for Chicago. He saw ln Sail
Francisco possibility of growth such â¢ as
Chicago has had. He then called upon
Mr. Bartlett of the club to epeak for
Â¦ hw,'
t Sir. Bartlett was witty. He told a story
cf a fisherman who got religion and be
came so conscientious that whenever he
caught a fish and wished to tell a story
*bout It he first weighed the fish. He
was called home by the birth of an heir
and took the fish scale to weigh the baby
in. He found the story it told was that
the weight was forty-seven pounds. When
the Chicago Commercial Club should re
turn home it would weigh every sunbeam.
every fruit and every flower in California
in its fish scales when telling of them. If
there was not a sufficient number of fish
scales in Chicago the club would borrow
some from St. l>suis. Cincinnati and Bos
ton, which have a plenty.
It had once been tnoueht that sharp
practice was characteristic of commercial
men. the speaker said, but that had bean
relegated to a. past time. A great future,
awaited San Frcuclsco. situated on the
Pacificâ the modern Mediterraneanâ not
wider than the elder Mediterranean wat?
to the ancients. San Francisco would have
the whole world for its market. All that
California needed was an assurance of a
continual and ample supply pt water. This
the Government could well afford to pro
vide and it would pront the Government
to do this.
It was late. 10 o'clock, when Irving M
Scott rose to introduce the first speaker
of the evening:. Mayor PhÂ«lan. Mr. Scotf
â¢spoke briefly. The voice *of California
hade him, he paid, extend the warmest
""welcome to thÂ» guests from the East that
the human heart was capable of. He paid
tribute to the splendid enterprise of Chi
caco, its masterly financing, the wonder
ful epirit which had made It what it is,
with one hand extended east and ono
hand extended west, reaching around the
g-lobe. He also Epoke of the splendid
brotherhood which makes the men of Cui
cago stand shoulder to shoulder and so
causes them to be victorious in everything
they have undertaken. He then intro
duced Mayor Phelam
Mr. Phelan called attention to the floral
design on rhe wall, emblematic of Chi
cago, in that railroads appeared to lead
In every direction "rom the center. San
Francisco, which had become a camp or
soldiers in the past few years, was now
glad to welcome other vjsitors who cam*
in the cause of peace. The Chicago men
and their truests were thrice welcome to
San Francisco. They came to a land rich
beyond the dreams of avarice ln natural
resources In mines, in fruitsâ lastly, in oil.
which, recently* discovered, promised lo
â¢make of San Francisco such a manufac
turing: center as is Chicago. â¢ "
One of the products of the frreat \\ e*st.
â¢the Mayor continued, was the wonderful
man. Carnegie, who began life as a mes
senger boy and who. having accumulated
a fortune of J200.0Ji>,i'v3. was now devoting
his wealth to the foundation of technical
schools and libraries Chicago, in its cre
ation of the "white city" of 1893, had fur
r.lshed a model for the world as an ar
tistic creation. The dawn of a -new cent
ury saw a realization of the prognostica
tions of Kidney Smith. Commerce pre
ceded art. It was significant that the
Chicago men were banqueted in an art
gallery and it was entirely appropriate
that such should be the place selected.
Mayor Phelan paid many kind things of
Chicago and of the commercial men who
had made it great. The Eastern Idea had
projected itself to San Francisco ln the
shape of the Santa. Fe. In accordance
with the Idea of the division 'of China the
Santa Fe had secured the China Basin.
San Francisco was proud of Its harbor, ln
â¢ which floated ships of evej-y nation, but
â¢was prouder of its own ships, the Oregon
and the flagship of Admiral Oewey, which
were created here. " San Francisco looked
â¢ on the achievements of Chicago. with ad
miration, not with jealousy. He welcomed
the guests, for the city and in the absence
cf the Governor, for the State.
I feel peculiarly happy in being able to Join
with you in welcoming our distinguished
guests. Though a recent comer I have all the
pride In welcoming our guests, to-night that
a *Â«er might have. I feel that this gathering
may lead to a sort of Commercial Club cir-
Ton have been great, not/ because you have
a. splendid harbor, not because you have nat
ural advantages; you're great because back of
all is a people that appreciate their standing.
You have contributed to the public rood; you
have contributed those things which â¢ have
drawn to this nation the admiration of the
world. To that end none has contributed more
than he who has come to your city to be the
president of a mighty railroad system.
We have seen in this decade the United
States take a front place In all that makes
commercial supremacy. But we have one great
Ieswon to learnâ I trust I speak no heresy when
I say itâ the gates of America must swing in
&s well as out If we are to take uâ > perma
nently a supreme station among the nations of
the world. If we do this we have contributed
to that which makes governments glorious and
peoples great.
In responding to the toast of the "South
ern Pacific" President Hays said:
one of our distinguished sons when he left our
State found his home here. It was ln Califor
nia that the gallant Baker was best appre
ciated.
Is Great in Her People.
If you walk the paths of literature you will
find her name. If you tread the walks of art,
the walks of war, California has done her
share. As an, Illlnoisan I do not forget that
James H. Eckels, president of the Chi
cago National Bank, contributed one of
the oratorical successes of the evening.
After speaking of his gratification ln vis
iting San Francisco for the first time, he
continued: \
This entertainment bespeaks again the warm
ness and generosity of a mighty people. Cali
fornia, young in the sisterhood of States com
pared with Illinois, has contributed .Its full
measure to that which has uplifted the status
of this country.
1 1 notice I am expected to say something
-bout the Santa Fe Railroad,- end. I think we
are now well established citizens. I must
entrench a little bit â¢ on the province of Mr.
Haysâ he has not been here much longer than
I have, and I j am sure that the longer he
stays here the better you'll - like him. And
I want to say here that thesÂ© two railroads
have no nearer object to their hearts than the
welfare of this Btate.
It has been my prlvelego for the list, ten
deys. to act as chaperon of several *â ntleiaen
whom I am proud to call my friends. Into the
borders of California, a State which I may
par â¢ I am -extremely delighted to bÂ»long.
Several of these gentlemen, I Imagine, had
an idea that California was a country dis
covered in 1897 by Chauncey M. Depew.
Mr. Keith "of Chicago responded to the
toa&t of "Banks." He 8aid that he had
visited California twenty-two years ago.
Then he was impressed with the pioneers
of this empire .State. They were men of
heroic mould, of fortitude and of bold
ness, and they laid the foundation of the
State broad and deep. History would
award them the highest honor for the
part they played so well. They were the
embodiinept of American grrit. The new
century had many gloriep. One of these
was prosperity. Coming across the conti
nent calamity was not found even ln
calamity Kansas, where a farmer com
plained once that the army worm took his
first crop, the cut worm the second and
the tape worm took the hired man. In
conclusion Mr. Keith spoke of the vast
possibilities of the Pacific Coast.
In response to the toast,- "The Commer
cial Museum." President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler of the University of California
made one of the most applauded speeches
of the evening. He said in part:
Like the explorers following- the Nile to the
Mountains of the Moon these explorer- have
followed the Iron rivers leading out of Chicago
to discover their source, and now they realize
that it is the mouth and not the source that
they have discovered. Those Iron rivers flow
from Chicago to San Francisco, ana this city
ls the outlet and not the commencement.
You have come cut here seeking the source
of railroads and you have found their mouth.
The front has become the rear and you'll have
to so a Ions way further than this to find the
front. -Â¦-../. Â¦
The People Who "Get a Move Oni"
We are glad to have you of Chicago with,
ns. We like your srit. we like your enenry.
we like the way you have of locking arms with
the man who "sets a move on." We want you
to help us with the task, for you know some
thing of lakes, and we want to make the Pa
cific Ocean an American lake.
