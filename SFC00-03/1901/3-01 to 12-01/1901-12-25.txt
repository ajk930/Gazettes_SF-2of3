\h, TTASHIXGTON, Dec 24.â In the
epre*d of thÂ« revolution in Venezuela, re
ported tills morning from Fort de France,
administration officials see the downfall
of President Castro.
Seaor Puldo, Venezuelan Charge d'Af
faires, refuses to discuss the revolution
ary situation, but other prominent Vene
zuelans here claim that Castro has not
yet lost his influence and power, and they
predict that he Trill quell the revolution
as promptly as he did tne revolutionary
movements irhich penetrated Venezuela
from Colombia.
â¢'President Castro is not like President

General Matos, now at Fort de France,
5s believed here to be the head of the rev
olutionary movement. He is not a military
mso, biit a. financier, and has held the
position of Secretary of the Treasury In
several cabinsts. He is rich and his own
funds are at the disposal of the revolu
tionists. The latter are well equipped and
â¢well armed, though email in numbers,
and it is admitted even by the most de
voted of Castro's adherents that the
President will have difficulty ln defeat-
Ing them.
Minister Bowen has been instructed to
keep the State Department advised of any
developments in the revolutionary situa
tion.
Indiana Within Call.
The battleship Indiana has arrived at
Curacao, it is believed by the Navy De
partment, and is therefore within call of
La Guayra should an outbreak at Caracas
imperil the safety of the American Lega
tion or American interests.
Reports from Berlin indicate that Ger
many â will await the result of the revo
lution before carrying out her programme
to compel Venezuela to satisfy the claims
held by Germans. The State Department
does not believe, from advices in its pos
session, that Germany will hesitate, but
rather expects it to make a naval demon
stration Ehortly, and if it is not suc
cessful in effecting a satisfactory settle
ment, to occupy the port of La Guayra
and collect the customs.
BEVOLUTION IS SPEEADING.
One Battle Is Fought Within Fifty
Miles of Caracas.
PORT DE FRANCE, Island of Marti
nique. Dec. 24.â The Venezuelan gunboat
Rcstaurander left here during the night.
Her destination is unknown. The British
steamer Ban Righ, said to be loaded with
erms and ammunition intended for the
adherents of Senor Matos, has arrived
here from Antwerp, which port she left
JCovember 29. Another alleged revolution
ary vessel has been sighted to the east
ward of this island.
There was fighting yesterday in Vene
zuela, where the revolutionary movement
is spreading. The engagement took place
at Villa de Coura, about fifty miles from
Caracas, and it is reported that the revo
lutionary commander. General Luciano
Slendcza, was defeated by the Govern
ment troops.
A Fighting has also occurred in the state
Â«cf Caraboba, but definite news on the
subject is difficult to obtain.
A dispute has arisen between the of
ficials of the German railroad running
from Caracas to Valencia and the Gov
ernment. All traffic is suspended between
these two points and the railroad stations
are occupied by troops.
Great excitement prevails everywhere
ln Venezuela, particularly in Caracas. The
Bituation is very serious.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â The asphalt
suit which has been pending for a long
time before the Venezuelan courts has ad
vanced another step toward the end.
Some time ago the case was taken before
the court of last resort, the Supreme

LONDON, Dec. 24.â The list of casual

River Colony, on December 20, when the
Boers, who were dressed as British yeo
men, defended a kopje against Damant's

reported by Lord Kitchener. It now ap

and twenty-nine killed and had five of

An army order issued to-night an

drilL The commander ln chief points out
In this connection that modern warfare
has so changed conditions that in order
that they shall be effective it is now im
perative that the volunteers attend the
annual instruction camps and field \
maneuvres.
It is generally believed that this order
will wipe out a, -large. majority of the prcs- .
ent volunteers.
The "War Office has decided to withdraw
twenty batteries of artillery from South .
Africa at once. This action is taken on j
the ground that under the present con
ditions of guerilla warfare the guns are
of little use, and are rather a hindrance
of mobility and decisive action.
Lord Kitchener in a dispatch dated Jo

BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 24.â The report
that Senor Concha Subercasseau, the
Chilean Minister, will renew here the ne
gotiations between Chile and Argentina
on a conciliatory basis, namely, the
evacuation by the forces of the two re
publics of the territories in dispute, ap
pears to be confirmed. A protocol in this
sense Is said to have been signed.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â Encouraging
news has reached the State Department
from Buenos Ayres and the officials have
renewed confidence that there will be a
peaceful settlement of the serious dispute
between Chile and Argentina. United
States Minister Lord at Buenos Ayres
has reported by cable that the Argentine
Government has concluded not to pre^s
the demand upon Chile which threatened
to lead to hostilities, but instead has de
cided to allow the issue to go before the
boundary commission, which has for sev
eral years been engaged ln the delimi
tation of the boundary. Moreover, Lord

to Chile has arrived ln Buenos Ayres tha

'filp16~nfaijc~ felairons" between" 'the two
countries have not been interrupted, as
was supposed from the report from our
Minister in Chile. - i . ; .
Commenting upon the London reporls
to the effect that the boundary commis
sion could not deal with the pending is
sue, being limited ln functions by the
treaty which created it to the definition
of the boundary, it is pointed out that,
admitting the existence of this limitation,
there Is still no good reason why, Chile
being willing, the necessary additional
authorization may not be given the com
mission by mutual consent of the parties.
VIRGINIA TOWN

WILLIAMSON, Va., Dec. 24.â Several
Logan County men rode into Dlngess, a
few miles west of here, to-day and while
intoxicated "shot up the town." The cit
izens fled in terror as plate glass windows
were cracked by flying bullets. In the
party were Walter Adams and John Mul
lins, half-brothers. Constable John Dil
lon was sent for and half an hour later
arrived and attempted to arrest the men,
when a regular street duel occurred,
probably twenty shots being fired. Con
stable Dillon and John Mullins were
killed Instantly and Adams was slightly
wounded, j The latter mounted his horse
and rode rapidly to the interior.

The Market Street Railway system
practically changed hands yesterday.
The Baltimore syndicate paid a small
fortune to I. "W. Hellman Jr. aÂ»
the first installment on the pur
chase price. The payment was made
In United States gold coin, which
was handed over the counter of the Union .
Trust Company's Bank shortly before the
closing hour yesterday afternoon. The
three months' option secured by the Bal
timore syndicate has been ended by the
Eastern capitalists buying the system.
The matter was brought to this abrupt
conclusion by the. report of the Eastern
bookkeepers and accountants, who on
their return to Baltimore recently stated
that the boots of the Market Street road
were perfect in every detail and that the
Market Street Company was making all
the profits claimed. Following this re
port G. R. "Webb of the Baltimore syndi
cate telegraphed Hon. Tirey L. Ford,
who is the legal representative of the
Eastern capitalists in this city, and asked
him if the requisite amount of stock was
on hand. Attorney Ford telegraphed
back that 83 per cent of the stock was in
escrow and properly indorsed, it being
in the bands of I. \V. Hellman Jr. at the
Union . Trust ..Company's -Bank. - G. R.
"Webb then "notified Attorney Ford to close
the deal, which was done yesterday.
Due to Hanford's Negotiations.
The change of ownership of the Market
Street Railway system has brought hard
work to many in the last few months.
Prominent among those who have shown
great skill and zeal in bringing about the
consummation of this great deal is R. G.
Hanford of San Francisco. Mr. Hanford
first came into prominence in arranging
the sale of the San Mateo Electric road
to the Baltimore syndicate. This deal he
accomplished with great credit to him
self. He followed, this by negotiating the
sale of the Sutter-street road, which deal
was eventually consummated.
Mr. Hanford then wrote to G. R. "Webb
of Baltimore and asked him to come to
the coast and inspect the Market Street
Railway with a view toward purchasing
it. Mr. "Webb represents the - wealthy
capitalists of Baltimore and upon Mr.
Hanford's earnest solicitations came to
San Francisco. He spent several weeks
here and thoroughly inspected the Market
Street system. At the conclusion of Mr.
"Webb's inspection he called on H. E.
Huntington and I. W. Hellman and stated
that he was anxious to purchase the road.
He stated that he was willing to place on
deposit a forfeit, but before he would pur
chase the road certain representations
which Messrs. Huntington and Hellman
had made must be verified. Experts came
out from the East and for weeks pored
over the books. They found that ail
Messrs. Huntington and Hellman had said
was true. The experts returned East and
informed Mr. Webb of the condition of
the system and he lost no time in tele
graphing Attorney Ford, asking him if
certain stock was in escrow. Mr. Ford
replied that the stock was all lying,
properly indorsed, at the bank. The
money was sent on and the deal Â«us
closed yesterday.
Will Select Local Directors.
The Baltimore syndicate now controls
83 per cent of the entire stock of the Mar
ket Street Railroad Company. H. E.
Huntington will no longer be president
and I. "W. Hellman will cease to be iden
tified with the street car corporation. The
Baltimore syndicate already owns many
street car systems in Eastern cities ar.d
wherever it has obtained control It has
at once become popular. Its policy is to
place local men of high standing and
popularity on the board of directors. The
directors are In touch with the people
and all complaints and petitions for im
provements are thoughtfully considered.
Under the new management the first
changes will be made in the list of offi
cials. The Baltimore syndicate will form
its own law department and "William F.
Herrin will no longer be associated with
the corporation as leading attorney. E.
P. "Vining will also be supplanted. Who
his successor will be is not at present
known, but it is an assured fact that the
Baltimore syndicate will select in hia
place a man thoroughly up-to-date. This
course has characterized its actions in the
past.
Jere T. Burke's services will also be dis
pensed with as soon as the Baltimore syn
dicate takes charge. It is known that tho
new owners are not Ln favor of having
such an expensive and unnecessary ad
junct on their payroll. Under their sys
tem of conducting business they will not
need any one to watch and attempt to
establish himself on a familiar footing

the scene of last week's wreck on the

wfien the engineer noted the click of the
wheels passing over ihe frog. He at

emergency brakes, bringing the train to
a halt and backing to a piace of safety
just as No. 10 arrived.
Hut for the keenness of the engineer's
hearing and his prompt action a frightful
collision would have been certain. The
wonder is that, while busy about his'lo

An investigation is under way to deter

have the switch lights burning.

forth between court and counsel, with an
attorney attempting to assault the Judge
while the latter dared him on and pieaded
with the Sheriff not to interfere, the Su
perior Court of Modoc County seemed for
a time this morning more like the" scene
of a barroom brawi than a ternpie wrtere

at was believed that the long expected

Not in years has a scene so disgraceful
been enacted in a California courtroom.

committed for contempt and he was so
committed under order of the court. . The
court then took a recess and Colburn was
taken to iall.
Claude Brown, a half-brother of the de
fendant, was called to the stand immedi

his ranch during the latter part 'of May
and until he was subpenaed hs a witness
by the Grand Jury in June. On cross-ex
amination, Attorney Baker asked several
questions concerning an alleged attempt
by detectives ' to bribe Witness Colburn.
The court refused to allow the questions
and when they were persisted in he or
dered the witness off the stand. This
aroused violent objections by counsel for
the defense, who protested, thar they had
not completed the cross-examination. K.
V. Spencer declared that he did. not be

and the prosecution with equal justice, in

Fines Recalcitrant Lawyers.
Judge Harrington turned to the clerk
and directed him to enter a fine of $30
against E. V. Spencer and $50 against
J. K. Baker for contempt of court, with
the alternative of twenty-five days in jail.
'.I don't give a tor your jail," ex
claimed Spencer. '
Raker asked Judge Harrington If the j
court had adjourned and was informed I
that it ha^l. Raker then demanded from
the reporter a transcript of the proceed

not to make such a transcript.
Then began a bitter war of words be
tween Judge Harrington and the attor
neys .for the defense. E. V. Spencer
cursed Judge Harrington before the
crowded courtroom. Harrington attempt
ed to reply, but his invective did not
equal the fierceness of Lassen County's
ex-Speaker of the Assembly. Spencer,-
Harris and Raker demanded that the pro
ceedings be transcribed so that they could
publish them to the world and let the
world judge as to who was right or
wrong.
The Sheriff interfered and prevented At
torney Raker attacking the Judge. Judge
Harrington declared that he was ready
for Raker at any time or any place and
told the Sheriff to let go of Raker. After
an exciting quarter of an hour the Sheriff

adversaries and all left the courtroom.

When the afternoon session opened all
participants in this morning's melee seem

Nothing had been done relative to the Hue
or commitment of Attorneys Raker and
Spencer, and both were still at liberty.
No attempt was made to proceed with
the trial and an adjournment to Thursday

Judge Harris, one of Brown's attorneys,
was before the police court this afternoon
on the. charge of assault with a deadly
weapon upon Mary Lorenz, a witness for
the prosecution. lie was represented by
Attorney Raker, and the people by Dis
trict Attorney Bonner and Deputy Dis

case grew out of an insulting remark by
Harris to Mrs. Lorenz, which culminated
in his being knocked down twice by the
woman. Then he drew a knife and at
tacked her, but bystanders interfered.
Judge Harris, not to be outdone by the
woman, to-day caused her arrest for as

Before the adjournment Harris started
to leave the courtroom. Judge Harring

Special DlBpatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 24.-Withm
the next three months the curtain will be
rung down upon Sitka, Alaska, and if the
steamer lines arrange for calls there more
than once a month it will be only to satis
fy the curiosity of sightseers. The seat
of government will be removed from Sit

After the officials of the capital of Alaska

living-in the old city except Indians and
white trappers.
Sitka is more than 100 years old, and
ever since, the United States owned Alas
ka the town has been the seat of govern
ment. By the end of the year the new
courthouse in Juneau will have been com
pleted, and the GovarnOr and other of
ficials will change their residence. Juneau
is one day's run by steamer from any
other of â¢ the Alaskan ports, whereas it
took fifteen days formerly to -get back
and forth from Sitka to Skaguay.
But Sitka is still the most picturesque
town. by far in Alaska. The roads arc
wide and well paved, and from the big
squared timbers under the wharf, which
In the days of Russian rule must have
been brought from afar, to the tops of the
pretty cottages that nestle under the side
of the mountain the place is one of par

the opposite to any one with a business
idea in view.
The Indians there are of all grades.
There are the pure bloods; others, are
half Russian, from the old stock of a
half century ago, and many are nearly
white. The Indian population will prob
ably remain, regardless of the desertion
of the town by the government.

dashed. out of the house.
The oil from the lamp caught fire and
ignited the girl's clothing. Miss Berg
schicker succeeded in extinguishing the
flames with a blanket, but her arms and
hands were badly burned, and she wa3
unconscious when found later by her
mother.
Parties have been searching the neigh

ORANGE GROWERS
LOSING HEAVILY
Claim the Transportation
Facilities Are Wholly-
Inadequate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 24.â A storm
of protest greater than that raised last
year by the orange growers of Southern
California, greater than the grumblings
that reached the Railroad. Commissioners,
is going up from the orange men of this
section. Never before in the history of
the industry in Southern California, have
the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific rail
way companies supplied such poor freight
service, and never before have the orange
growers so keenly felt the- need .of proper
transportation facilities. . . : ,
Seth Marshall, president of the High
land Orange Growers' Association and
one of the best posted men in Southern
California, estimates that the loss. to the
growers . by the failure of the railroad
companies to. transport the fruit properly
will exceed $5,000,000. This may. seem a
large figure, but when it Is known that
the orange orop-of last'season was valued
at about $13,000,000 it becomes apparent
that a loss of $5,000,000 could . be sus
tained. This would mean approximately
$200 to the car. Losses of this extent are
sustained by the failure of the railroads
to properly ventilate the cars arid the ap
parent inability of the companies to place
the fruit In the Eastern markets within
a reasonable length of time. â¢ â¢
Returns have' been received from sev
eral hundred carloads of oranges shipped
for the Christmas lrade\ and, in nearly
every car a certain percentage of the
fruit has rotted. . The. cars are equipped
with good ventilating appliances, but the
trainmen fail to open-or shut- the ye,ntila
tors at the proper times and the ".fruit is
thus damaged. ' \' ' ' ' 'â  ."
Even this would be overlooked by. the
growers if better service were given them.
In many cases it hÂ£s -taken twenty-five
days for a car to travel from this city to
New York, a journey 'that ought to be
made In eight or ten days. To Chicago
it generally takes ; the company from
twelve to eighteen days, while freight
could. easily be placed there In six days.
The same is true in regard to transporta
tion to nearly every Eastern market. .
The Santa Fe and Southern Pacific com
panies have pooled on the orange business,
and are - dividing the' profits. Ninety
cents a. box, or about 1 2-9 cents a pound.'
is charged, and the packers are allowed'

MACLAY IS
ORDERED OUT
Navy Yard Laborer Dis
missed by President
Roosevelt.
Objections Made by j Reviier
. of Schley Are Not
Noticed.
lieutenant General Miles Says He
Will Not Make Application
for a Court of In
. quiry.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â Secretary
Long has discharged Edgar Staunton Ma
clay from his position as a skilled laborer
in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Maclay hav
ing refused to resign when requested to
do so. Maclay criticized Admiral Schley
in his naval history as a "caitiff, poltroon
and coward."
Secretary Long's action was taken by
direction of the President and followed a
conference between the President and the
Secretary, who took to the White House
with him a . letter from Maclay in re
sponse to the request for his resignation
sent by the Secretary last Saturday.
In this letter Maclay submitted that he
could not.be removed or compelled, to re
sign without definite charges being made
against him and without having an op
portunity to answer those charges. Al
though the civil service rules give em
ployes of the service the opportunity of
answering charges that may be preferred
against them, the President exercised his
prerogative In the present incident and
directed Maclay's removal, it being held
that the latter was aware unofficially, if
not officially, of the reasons which actu
ated the executive in taking the course
determined upon. Secretary Long said
the action taken to-day would dispose of
the case finally. .
The Letter of Maclay.
â Maclay's letter to Secretary Long re
plying to the request for his resignation
is as follows:
NAVY YARD, NEW YORK, Office of the
General Storekeeper, Dec. 23, 1901.â Rear Ad
miral Albert S. Barker, U. S. N.. Commandant
Navy Yard, New York â Sir: I have the honor
of acknowledging the receipt of your commu
nication of this date In which you forwarded
the following- communication of this date from
the Honorable Secretary of the Navy. "I ani
directed by the President to ask Edgar S.
Maclay, special laborer, general storekeeper's
office, navy yard. New York, to send in his
resignation."
I respectfully submit that I was regularly
appointed to my present position after having
duly passed a clerk's examination in accordance
with all the requirements of the civil sfrvice
regulations and therefore cannot be removed
or be compelled to resign without definite
charges being made against ma and without
having an opportunity to answer those charges.
I have been in this office fifteen months, have
been promoted for efficiency and so far as I
know my work has been satisfactory to my
superiors. I have violated no rules or regu
lations of this office or of the navy yard* so
far as I am aware.
Sucli being the case I feel that it would not.
only be an injustice to myself to resign under
such circumstance", but it would be establish
ing a precedent that vitally . concerns thou
sands of civil service employes, both national
and State. Very respectfully yours,
EDGAR S. MACI^AY.
Secretary Long's dispatch to Rear Ad
miral Barker directing Maclay's removal
was as follows:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Rear Admiral A.
S. Barker. U. S. N., Commandant Navy Yard,
New York: By direction of the President
Edgar S. Maclay Is discharged. Notify him.

. Miles Refuses to Talk.
Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles re
turned to the city to-day from his brief
visit to New York. The General declined
to discuss the question of the reprimand
given him by the Secretary of War for
his published observations on the report
of the verdict of the court of inquiry in
the Schley case, and in reply to inquiries
as to his future course in the matter said
he had no statement to make. He did
say, however, that the report that he ;
would apply for a court of inquiry was I
entirely unauthorized.
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â Historian Maclay
did not forward to "Washington to-day
his resignation as special laborer at the
navy yard in Brooklyn, although he said
on Monday night that he intended to do
so. He said:
"I have not resigned and I do not In
tend to as yet. I shall not decide upon
a course of action until I have communi
cated with the civil service authorities
at Washington. I want to convince my
self that President Roosevelt actually ha3
power to disregard civil service regula
tions. It I find he is possessed of such
right, then I will resign at once."
Judgment for $36 and costs was ren
dered to-day against Maclay by Justice
Van Wart in the Second District Munici
pal Court In Williamsburg in an action
brought by a brewing company. It was
alleged that in November and December
of 1S97, while Maclax was the keeper of
the old Field lighthouse, near Port Jef
ferson,- L. I., the brewing company sent
him cases of beer on his order. Neither
Maclay nor his counsel appeared In court.

of the crew of the wrecked three-masted
schooner E. I. "White of Harrington, Me.
The White was bound from Philadel

and was stranded on Gingerbread Shoal
on December .7. Soon after grounding the
vessel began to roll and grind on the
rocks and she showed signs of breaking
up. Three of the crew preferred to trust
their lives to the ship's boat which was
launched alongside. During the night fol
lowing the swell capsized the boat and
two of the seamen were drowned. They
were a Finlander named John Saare and
an American named Brown. The man
rescued was Charles Johnson. The next
day Captain Mitchell' and the remainder
of the crew proceeded in the boat to
Bernini Island, and thence were assisted
to Nassau. . -

WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â Eighty-seven
big turkeys were distributed to the White
House policemen, messengers, ushers,
servants, gardeners and stablemen to-day
with the compliments of the President.
Each turkey had on it a card bearing the
season's compliments. The distribi;^-^
was the largest ever made at the Wj.ie
House. President McKinley always gave
turkeys to the married employes, but the
list of recipients was never so large as
that of to-day. The turkeys were dis
tributed by Henry Plnckney. the White
House steward.
Express wagons, mail carriers and mes
sengers bore numerous packages to the
White House to-day, presents to the
Kocsevelt family from friends ar.d admir
ers throughout the country. Many of the
packages were for the children, who will
not be allowed, however, to have them
until to-morrow.
The programme at the White House to
morrow will follow the custom of the
family in former years. There will be no
Christmas tree, as a tree never has been
a part of the celebration of Christmas Jn
the Roosevelt family. The children, how
ever, all hang up their stockings, and
they will arise early to-morrow^ to visit
them and ascertain what Santa (Jaus has

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A COMMON TROUBLE.
Thousands Suffer From. It Without
Knowing Its Real Character.
No trouble is more common or mora
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nervej
are to blame, are surprised that they ara
not cured by nerve medicines and spring
remedies; the real seat of the mischief
is lost sight of; the stomach is the organ
to be looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms ot
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspepsia
shovrs itself not in the stomach so much
as- in nearly every other organ; in some
case3 the heart palpitates and is irregu-
lar; in others the kidneys are affected;
in others the bowels are troubled, wnh
loss of flesh and appetite, with the ac-
cumulation of gas, sour risings and hear;-
burn.
Mr. A. "W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
St.. Indianapolis, lnd., writes as follows:
"A motive of pure gratitude prompts ma
to write these few lines regarding the
new and valuable medicine, Siuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I have been a sufferer
from rervous dyspesia for the last four
years; have used various patent medicines
and other remedies without any favorable
result. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicina j
wore off. I attributed this to my sedentary A
habits, being a bookkeeper with little
physical exercise, but I am glad to state
that the tablets have overcome all these
obstacles, for I have gained in flesh, sleep
better and am better in every way. Tho
above is wTltten not for notoriety, but la
based on actual facts."

MANILA. Dec. 24.â Civil Governor Taft !
left here this afternoon for San Francisco

the other insurgent chiefs on the island
of Bohol. have surrendered with fweaty
eigh: cannon and forty-five guns.
During an engagement in Batangas
province between the insurgents and a de
tachment of the Twenty-first Infantry

American private wats badly wounded. A
number of the enemy were killed.
A. large number of Filipinos captured in
I^aguna and Batangas provinces have
been sent to the re-established military
prison at Subig Bay.
The column under Colonel Dougherty
is making a clean sweep of I>aguna prov
ince, burning all the insurgent barracks
that are found and a number of small
native hamlets. Colonel Dougherty has
taken many prisoners and the insurgent
losses during his operations have been
heavy.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 24.â The
War Department has received Â»from the
Philippines the records of court martial
by which three natives were tried for im
plication in the murder of five American
prisoners. One of the Filipinos was
fomoteo X>ahlan, a conmndante of the
insurgent forces, -who ordered Manuel
G^nzales, a lieutenant of insurgents, to
Â»^ ' the presidente of the pueblo of San
m/uel de Mayuma, province of Bulucan.
Gonzalcs, in command of a band of in
surgents, successfully ambushed a detach
ment of the Thirty-nfth Volunteer Infan
try, taking five of the American soldiers
prisoners. The Americans had been act
ing as a guard for the presidente and he,
too, passed into the hands of the insur
gents. The Americans captured and after
ward killed were John T. Hick
man, Company B; William Smith, Com
pany C; Hamlet Jan-is. Company C; El
mer Dane. Company E, and Frank H.
Wilson, Company E. The presidente was
stabbed. The Americana were placed In
charge of a sergeant, taken away and
killed with bolos. There was an attempt
on the part of each of the three Filipinos
to shift the responsibility for the crimes
at the trial. It was developed that Com
andante r>ahlan. in ordering the am
buscade, gave the following directions to
Lieutenant Gonzales:
"Separate Jose liuencamlno (thÂ© presi

South American ports. He was a mem
ber of a party of nine which set out from
Provo City to obtain specimens, alive or
dead, of the fauna and tlora of Central

on horseback, to collect animals, birds,
pelts and piants for the Brignam Young

quantities of valuable specimens were

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1901.
GOVERNOR OF IOWA IS EXPECTED
TO ACCEPT THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO
After Conferring With Senator Allison and Speaker Hender
son Shaw Proceeds to, Washington to See the Presi
dentâQuestion as to Whether Wilson Will Remain
WASHINGTON. Dec. 24. â The
Cabinet was in Bession a
little over an hour to-day.
Practically no business was
transacted, the whole time
being occupied In felicitations of the sea
son. The President did not mention the
fact that he had tendered tho Treasury
portfolio to Governor Shaw of Iowa at
the meeting, but privately talked with
Secretary Wilson about the matter, tho
latter expressing; the opinion that Gover
nor Shaw would accept. Whenever Clov
ernor Shaw is ready to assume tho duties
of tho position, Secretary Gage will turn
over the administration of the treasury to
him. Secretary Gage has not yet an
nounced hlÂ« plans for the future.
If Governor Shaw goes Into the Cabinet
thÂ© question has been raised us to whether
Secretary Wilson, who also comes from
Ipwa, will remain. On this point a Cabi
net officer Is quoted as Baying that tho
President particularly desires that Secre
tary Wilson shall continue In the Cabinet.
His work In tho Department of Agri
culture is highly appreciated by the farm
ers of the country and the President docs
not desire to lose him.
Governor Leslie M. Shaw, who has been
offered the Treasury portfolio, and who
Is now on his way to Washington, is ex
pected to arrive here early to-morrow
morning. The general impression among
Iowa public men in this city Is that Gov
ernor Shaw will accept the portfolio.

BRITAIN WILL
LOSE IN RANK
Serious Commercial Con
ditions Confront the
English.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 24.â There is a
large and ever-increasing number of
thoughtful and well-informed people in
Great Britain who express the serious be
lief that if radical changes do not come
about in the near future the United King
dom will be relegated to the third position
in the rank of the world's trade and com
merce.
This statement Is made by United States
Consul Boyle, at Liverpool, In his annual
report, extracts from which were made
public to-day by the State Department.
It is conceded, says Consul Boyle, that In
manufactures. Great Britain, within the
last few years, has failed to meet the
competition of the United States and Ger
many.
Boyle says the optimistically inclined
plead exceptional and marvelous natural
advantages as far as the United States
is concerned, while, as to Germany's fierce
competition, the unsatisfactory financial
and commercial situation now prevailing
in that empire is cited as an instance of
a country booming itself too rapidly. The
cry of "Something must be done," says
the Consul, is going up from commercial
bodies, political speakers, economic writ
ers and the newspapers. There are fears
expressed, says Boyle, that even in the
carrying trade the> supremacy of Great
Britain is threatened. When the war in
South Africa is over, he says, there is to
be a popular demand for legislative ac
tion and the indications are that the
British Government will be compelled to
give more earnest consideration to mat
ters relating to trade and commerce.
There is a strong sentiment among the
masses of Great Britain, and one which
appears to be gaining strength 'as time
goes on, in favor of bringing about what
has become popularly known as "fair
trade," and which, says Boyle, Is nothing
but reciprocity. Protection, he says, is
not very muph advocated, but it is signi
ficant that many of the most widely cir
culated papers of Great Britain are . now
boldly advocating a policy of "fair trade,"
or "do to others as they do to you."
Against this sentiment, however, the Con
sul says, must be set the national dislike
to change established institutions, of
which free trade Is one of the most funda
mental. ; '
In regard to educational reforms in the
United Kingdom, Boyle says that the uni
versally acknowledged inferiority of Great
Britain to most of the leading nations,
particularly the United States and Ger
many, Is given frequently as one of tho
chief reasons why Great Britain is being
outstripped in her manufactures. The
subject of education, he says, is a very
thorny one in England. Efforts are now
being made by the respective authorities
to secure uniformity of methods and re
aults, while raising the standard at the
same time.
A particularly interesting portion of
Consul Boyle's report is that, wherein he
views the American and the British work
man side by side in a comparison which
places the American far to the fore. ' Eng
lish manufacturers, he says, find it almost
impossible to get the same amount of
proouct from machines as is obtained in
America. The small extent to whlcn up
to-aato labor-saving machinery is used in
Great Britain, as compared with America
and even Germany, Boyle says, is a fiuit
f'H topic of discussion. English raanu
facturero, he says, are handicapped by
reason of antiquated plants.
STRIKE OF MACHINISTS
MAY SOON BE SETTLEI)
Four Hundred Men in Chicago Are
Likely to Return to
Work.
CHICAGO, Dec. 24.â It is stated that the
machinists' strike in Chicago, which has
inyolved 400 union workmen since it start
ed seven months ago, is about to be set
tled. Conferences are now being held be
tween leaders on both sides and it Is ex
pected that an agreement .will be reached
and ratified within the next few days.
It is said the Allis-Chalmers Company
rns agreed to return to the nine-hour
day, which" leaves the question of wages,
the strikers to be taken back and the dis
position of the men who took the strikers'
places to be determined. The union men
have dismissed their conspiracy charge
recently entered against W. J. Chalmers.
It is said that' the strike so far has cost
the Allls-Chalmers Company $300,000 and
the union $30,000 in carrying on the fight,
to say nothing of the heavy loss in wages.
The strike, while a local affair, has been
regarded as a test of strength between
the International Association of Machin
ists and thÂ© Metal Trades Association.
Paris' Christmas Toy Fair.
PARIS, Dec. 24.â The Christmas toy
fair held along the boulevards of Paris
presented its customary aspect this year.
The booths were attractively decorated,
but the unceasing rains completely
marred the usual street enthusiasm. The
midnight masses in the churches were
well attended, while revelers rilled the
many cafes and restaurants until an
early hour in the morning. Madame Lou
bet, wife of the President, presented
Christmas gifts to the servants employed
in the Elysee palace and their children.
She afterward attended the Fete of Al
sace-Lorraine, held In the winter circus,
where toys and clothing were distributed
from the great Christmas tree to 6000'
children of indigent exiles from the lost
province.
Shoots Wife and a Stepson.

ROYAL SECRETS
IN THE DRAWER
â 
An Interesting Discovery
Made; in Breaking ~
of a Clock.
CINCINNATI, -Dec. 24.â The Enquirer's
Gallipolis special says the discovery of a
manuscript in a secret drawer of an old
clock reveals a secret of the French court
and shows the reason of the visit to that
city in 1789 of the Duke of Orleans, after
wards Louis Philippe of France.
. . The discovery was made by Claude M.
Wall, while taking apart an old French
clock which has long been standing in the
storage-room of his store. He found a
secret drawer in the clock which con
tained an old parchment manuscript in
French, wrapped with a child's flannel
skirt richly embroidered and bearing a
monogram. A piece of fine lace was also
with the manuscript.
Upon translation the manuscript pur
ported to be a "true history of Adele
d'Alonquon." It bore the signature of
Louis d'Alonquon and was 'dated Octo
ber 15, 1789. It was addressed to Adele,
apparently to be given her when she grew
to maturity. The substance of It was
that Adele was the daughter of the Duke
of .Orleans. The mother died at the child's
"birth, ignorant of the rank of its father.
The writer was then placed In charge of
the child and sent with it to Gallipolis,
where there was a French colony.
The story rai>that he became her pre
ceptor, and finally, after the visit of the
Duke of Orleans to Gallipolis, It was de
termined to send Adele to a Catholic
school in France. The mother of Adele not
being of royal blood, the marriage was
kept secret. /
Wall has sent the manuscript to' the
French Embassador at WtiBhingtori". Some
portions of the papers giving names and
lineage have not been made public.

Question of- the Ownership
of Land Causes the
> Lawsuit.
NEW YORK, Dec. 24. - An alleged
fraudulent transfer of a Kansas farm
valued at $15,000 is the charge brought
against Mrs. Minnie McQoy and her
daughter Lulu McCoy of Chicago, who
appeared before a magistrate here to
day.
The two women were arrested here
yesterday on complaint of Charles Mc-
Coy, who claims that his sister, named
Lulu M. McCoy, is the rightful owner of
the land and that the Lulu McCoy named
as defendant -made use of the similarity oi
names to transfer lands in which she had
no rightful interest.
Joseph M. McCoy of Phillips County,
Kansas, the original owner of the land,
died in 1889 and left 160 acres of bottom
land to his daughter, Lulu M. McCoy.
Up to two years ago she had no doubt
but that the land was still in her posses
sion, although managed by another. In
1899, however, a "personal" stating that
"if Miss Lulu McCoy will correspond with
Joseph Coftey of "Woodruff, Iowa, she will
learn something to her advantage," ap
peared in a Chicago paper.
Charles McCoy alleges that this adver
tisement was answered by Mrs. Minnie
McCoy, ani that as a result a transfer
of the land to Coffey was signed by Mrs.
McCoy's daughter, Lulu. Mrs. McCoy
told the police, it Is said, that Coffey paid
her daughter $546 for the deed. Through
Ooffey, it is said, the land was sold to
O. S. Wing of Hamburg. Iowa.
Wing reached Chicago yesterday with
ex-Congressman N. B. McCormick, his
attorney. Wing said he was acting in
good faith and that he gave Coffey $90u
to get the signature of Miss McCoy to
the deed, supposing that the rightful
owner alone would be found bearing that
name.
Mrs. Minnie McCoy is credited with as
serting that she had no reason to believe
that the land might not have been willed
to her daughter, as she . had relatives In
Kansas. Mrs. McCoy and her daughter
declare their > willingness to transfer to
Wing 160 acres of land in Michigan to re
imburse him if It is found that the Kan
sas farm should be transferred back to
the other Lulu McCoy. A continuance In
the hearing until January 3 was taken
In order to bring wltnessess from Kan

IS IT AN EPIDEMIC?
Vital Statistics Show an Alarming
Increase in an Already Prevailing
Disease â Are Any Exempt?
At po time in the history of disease ha:
there been such an alarming increase ir
the number of cases of any particulaj
malady as in that of kidney and bladdei
troubles now preying upon the people o:
this country.
To-day we see a relative, a friend or ar
acquaintance apparently well, and in t
few days we may be grieved to learn o)
their serious illness or sudden death,
caused by that fatal type of kidnej
trouble â Brlght's disease.
Kidney trouble often becomes ad-
vanced into acute stages before thi
afflicted is aware of its presence; that is
why we re.ad of so many sudden deaths
of prominent business and professional
men. physicians and others. They havÂ«
neglected to stop the leak In time.
While scientists are puzzling their
brains to find out the cause, each indi-
vidual can by a little precaution avoid the
chances of contracting dreaded and dan-
gerous kidney trouble, or eradicate it
completely from their system if already
afflicted. Many precious lives might havÂ«
been, and many more can yet be saved,
by paying attention to the kidneys.
It Is the mission of The Call to benefit
its readers at every opportunity and
therefore we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble to
write to-day to Dr. Kilmer & Co.. Bing-
hamton, N. Y., for a free sample bottle
of Swamp-Root, the celebrated specific

FROM AMERICAN FRIENDS AND KING
Those Who Were Guests on Board the Erin During the
Yacht Races Present a Magnificent Punch Bowl, and
Edward VII Sends Cigarette Case With Royal Monogram
LONDON", Dec. 24.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton to-day received a magnificent
silver" punch bowl and a stand as
a Christmas gift from John
Crimmins, J. H. Flagler, Charles
Dana Gibson, Judge Morgan O'Brien and
nineteen other Americans, who were
guests on board the Erin during the races
this year for the America's cup. Sir
Thomas said:
"I cannot say how delighted I am. It
merely shows that if a man does the
right thing in America they appreciate it
as no other people do. I have -never re
ceived anything I valued more than this
splendid gift from my American friends."
King Edward has presented Sir Thomas
Upton with a cigarette case bearing the
royal monogram. It is a replica of the
one the King himself uses.

ders a decision adverse to them.
AN ULTIMATUM EXPECTED.
Germany Will Take Such Action Un
less Venezuela Yields.
BERLIN, Dec. 24.â The announcement
that Germany had sent an ultimatum
to Venezuela has been conspicuously
printed in the press here. Those news
papers maintaining the closest relations
with the Government affirm that this
news is premature. While an ultimatum
has not yet been delivered to Venezuela,
Jh*-y say. this step will soon be taken un
less Venezuela yields to what are deemed
thp reasonable demands of Germany.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung, in an exten-
Blre article on Germany's attitude to

the assurances of Dr. von Holleben. the
German Kmbaesador to the United States,
with regard to the Venezuelan matter, in
dicate Germany's recognition of the Mon
roe doctrine in a more absolute manner
than has heretofore been done. It says
Germany bows to the Monroe doctrine,
and alludes to the expression of the late
Prince Bismarck that the Monroe doc
trine was "a piece of impudence." This
utterance of the German statesman,
which is doubtless authentic, has just
been published for the first time by the
Hamburger Nachrichten, Bismarck's
household organ. Nevertheless, the
Cologne Volks Zeitung admits that "the
impudence of the United States" is suc
ceeding brilliantly, and that Europe is al
ready accustoming itself to the idea of
the tutelage of the United States in South
America.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung concludes by
paying: "Must Germany really ask
Washington's permission to collect 3,000,
000 marks from Venezuela? Must we
pocket all sorts of warnings and con
cealed threats?" â¢ -
SPAIN TO MAKE A PLEA.
Venezuela Will Try for a Rpconcila-
tion With France.
PARIS, Dec. 24.â Venezuela having
failed last year In her attempt to renew
diplomatic relations with France, even
after the good offices of the United
States had been invoked to assist in the
negotiations, has at last got the Spanish
Government to instruct the' Spanish' Em
bassador in Paris to plead her cause. The
Embassador, Marquis Leon y Castillo, has
laid the proposals of Venezuela before
the French Government and they will
Man Under Water Nine Hours.
CHICAGO, Dec. 24.â Captain Louis Sar
cho to-night broke the world's record for
remaining under water, in a diving suit.
In a big tank at the Coliseum he lay im
mersed under ten feet of water for nine
hours. The feat is accomplished by com
ing up under a sunken barrel. -The best
previous achievement of the kind was
eight hours and thirty minutes. Sarcho is
the diver whose exploits in exploring the
wreck of the battleship Maine attracted
attention in the harbor of Havana.
Make Attack on the Wrong Man.
John Redmond, employed at the Union
Iron Works, was attacked at â¢an early
hour yesterday morning on Potrero ave
nue by two men who mistook him for a
ecab. In the tight that followed Redmond
knocked out his two assailants, and sent
one of them, James McNamara, to the
Emergency Hospital with a broken leg.
The other man escaped. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1901,
shortly be taken into consideration. The
basis of the proposals is as follows:
Arrangement of the French claims aris
ing out of the revolutions of 1892, 1898, 1899,
1!M)O and 1901, within a period which shall
not exceed one year.
Venezuela demands that in future
France, like Italy, shall recognize the
Venezuelan courts as having jurisdiction
to decide France's claims and that the
duties imposed on Venezuelan coffee im
ported into France shall be removed.
Uhe French* Government intends, if its
conditions are not accepted soon, to im
pose prohibitive import duties on Vene
zuelan cocoa, 74 per cent of the crop of
which is consumed by this country. If
this measure were to be put into effect
it would ruin Venezuela-, which would not
know where to place cocoa. The Caracas
Chamber of Commerce, realizing the dan
ger, has written to the Chambers of Com
merce at Havre, Bordeaux and Marseilles
to the effect that it is endeavoring to In
duce the Government of. Venezuela to lis
ten to reason In order that an under
standing may be arrived at. '
It is said that Cecilio Castro, who has
been already charged with a diplomatic
and financial mission in France, which
was fai^ from successful, will leave Car
acas December 2? in order to Bubmit the
memorandum, revised by President Cas
tro.
The French Government is determined
not to be lenient, having, five years ago
accepted a protocol signed by General
Peitri, the authorized representative of
Venezuela, which was afterward refused
by the Government of Venezuela. It is
considered at the French Foreign Office
that Senor Castro's voyage will be useless
unless he takes with him a document
signed by President Castro, which would
become a protocol and would have to be
accepted by the Venezuelan Congress be
fore the French Government ratified it

MICHIGAN TEAM
ARRIVES HERE
Noted Football Men Are
En Route to South
ern California.
Will Play the Stanford Eleven
â¢ at Pasadena on New
Year's Day. ' '
The invincible, all-conquering football
team representing the. University of Mich
igan arrived last night in its special car
attached to the limited. The men went
at once to the Palace, where they will
remain until to-morrow, when they will
proceed to Pasadena.
They are rrjaking the long pilgrimage
from Ann Arbor, Mich., to meet the foot
ball eleven of Stanford University on New
Year's day at the Pasadena Tournament
of Roses. The Stanford men have been
on the scene some days and are training
assiduously for their meeting with the
Michigan eleven. -
The latter team has the extraordinary
record of having scored 501 points during
the past season, arid has not been scored
against during the same period. Much
credit has been given F. H. Yost, who
coached the team this year, for the bril
liant record it has made. His work ha-5
given such satisfaction that he has been
engaged for another three years with the
Ann Arbor institution of learning. In 1900
he coached the Stanford University team,
when the cardinal defeated the University
of California by a score of 5 to 0, the win
ning points ' being scored by Trae^er in
the last few moments of play.
Michigan has always enjoyed a wealth
of football material second to none in the
country, and haa invariably turned out
strong- and formidable teams. In the Mid
dle West she has always held a place in
the front rank among the colleges, and
has exerted wide influence in popularizing
football.
The members of the Michigan party reg
istered at the Palace are: Snow, Weeks,
Sweeley, Redden, Shorts, Graver, Heston,
Gregory, Wilson, Hernsteln, McGuggin,
Redner, Forrest, Southworth, White, Fit?-
Patrick, Manager Baird, Coach Yost, Rob
inson, Crafts and Eversman.
The visitors will be entertained at din
ner to-night at the California Hotel, cov
ers being laid for fifty. It is expected that
the banquets and the various changes of
climate through which the men are pass-
Ing will play havoc with their condition.
They expect a week at Pasadena to put
them on edge for the New Year's day
game, however.
COACH SIMPSOKT RETURNS.
Berkeley Football Leader Present at
Many Big Games.
Dr.' Frank Simpson, head football coach
of the University of California, has re
turned from his wedding trip through lite
East. He reached the East during the
height of the football season and saw tre
majority of the big games.
On the Monday after reaching New
York Dr. Simpson saw Columbia practice
On Tuesday he saw Yale practice. Wed
nesday he was present when West Point
P'ayed the University of Pennsylvan-a.
Thursday he saw Harvard practice and
Saturday he was one of the 37,000 specta
tors who saw Harvard defeat Yale 22-3
â¢Harvard was in a class by herself this
ve ar. said Dr. Simpson yesterday. "She
had the heaviest team in the East and the
best material. Her players were all well
trained. Yale s men were out of condi
tion. Captain Gould said their method
was to play them until they rounded back
into condition, a system of which I do
not approve.
. ] ? a I vard took Yale's tackleback play
of 1900, with which she defeated the
former by a score of 28-0, and revised and
changed it, making it more effective. This
play helped defeat Yale. Harvard had
another play which was both pretty and
effective. At the kiqkoff her forwards ran
back toward their own goal to meet the
runner. Encircling him they advanced
the ball up the field. .
"The West Point- Annapolis game was
a brilliant spectacle, as the army and
navy men among the spectators were in
full uniform. The day was an ideal one
for football. The game was a close one
Annapolis putting up a great game in the
second half.
"I found but little difference between
the game as played An the East and on
this coast. I was afforded every oppor
tunity of noting their methods of play
and of coaching, as I was on the field be
hind the teams while they were at prac
tice and on the side lines during the
games. At some of the colleges there was
a noticeable lack of that spirit with which
the students at the University of Califor
nia support their players."
SEEK A NEW OWNER FOR
NEW YORK BASEBALL CLUB
Spalding Wishes E. B. Talcott, a
Former Stockholder, to Purchase
Freedman's Interest in Club.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â A. G. Spald
ing, who was elected president, secretary
and treasurer of the National Baseball
League by a faction of that organization
at, its last meeting in New York, had a
conference to-day with Edward B. Tal
cott, one of the former stockholders In
the New York club. The object of the
conference was to induce Mr. Talcott to
resume his connection with the latter or
ganization and to endeavor, if possible,
to purchase the interests of President
Freedman. Mr. Spalding said in his opin
ion nothing would so popularize the game
In New York as would the return of Mrt
Talcott to an active participation in the
sport in that city. Mr. Talcott will take
the matter under consideration.
NEW YORK. Dec. 24.â Delancey Nicoll
attorney for Andrew J. Freedman of the
New York Baseball Club, made public a
letter tp-day replying to and commenting
upon the document addressed to the Na
tional League clubs on Saturday last by
A. G. Spalding. The letter was addressed
to the Boston, Cincinnati and St. Louis
clubs and was as follows:
"You have called my attention to a let
ter received this day by you from Mr. A.
G. Spalding and have asked me what ef
fect, if any. It has upon the present con
troversy. It seems to me that the letter
amounts to a withdrawal on Mr. A. G.
Spalding's part from the office of presi
dent-secretary-treasurer of the National
League. He informs you that he 'must
refuse to act further as president-secre
tary-treasurer of the National League '
and goes on to say that it is 'up to each
club to do that which in its judgment
may .seem best for its own interests.'
Thia is in effect advice to the clubs to
shift for themselves. Mr. Spalding was
never elected president-secretary-treas
urer of the National League. His pre
tended election was entirely without au
thority. The courts have taken this view
of It by Issuing the Injunction, and Mr.
Spalding seems to have come to the same
conclusion himself. Every act of a part
of a National League by which it under
took to elect a president, director or other
officer, in the absence of a majority of
that body, was Illegal and the persons!
who held their respective offices by such
authority are open to the charge i of
usurpation of the functions of the office.
"It does not seem to me necessary that
you should make any reply to Mr. Spal
ding's communication of this morning
The status of the National League re
mains the same as it was .before the pre
tended election of Mr. Spalding as presi
dent-secretary-treasurer/'

RING AT OAKLAND IS BADLY SINGED
OVER THE WINNING OF FOUR FAVORITES
Toijimy Burns Finally Strikes His Gait, Landing First on
Edgardo and Decoyâ Quiz II Gets Home at Lengthy
Oddsâ Pompino Is Bid Up and Secured by T. H. Ryan
FOR just two Innings ! at Oakland
yesterday. things broke very bauly
for the talent, then business
picked up. The members of the
ring handled four very warm ones
in Pompino, Edgardo, Decoy and Danger
ous Maid, all favorites, until some of the
bank rolls were returned to this side of
the bay as light as a Coney Island bathing
suit. The fields were not above medioc
rity in class and nothing: of a sensational
nature marked the afternoon's sport. A
large crowd was in attendance.
Quiz II, with Kansch up," came out fresh
and bright looking as a spring poppy and
at odds of H to 1 won all the way in the
opening Futurity course sprint. IParsifal,
the 7 to 5 favorite, died away in the
stretch with Woods, losing out the place
to the 75 to 1 shot Hasp, ridden by little
Treanor. â¢â¢â ..â â¢
On recent form Jacqueminot, the entry
of Walter Jennings, looked about the best
of the eight starters in the two-year-old
event next decided and was installed a
13 to 10 favorite. The iilly held the lead
to within a short distance of the wire,
where Quadra- got up and beat her a neck.
The winner had Bullman in the saddle
and closed at 8 to 1. Flo Culver finished
third.
The talent stayed with Louis Ezell's
Sharp Bird, making the erratic sprinter
favorite for the FuturityÂ«course â¢ selling
number. He showed speed out in front
and then faded away as usual. At the
wire Pompino won, ridden out. from Flo
ronso. At a longer route the latter could
possibly have won. De Capo ran into
show.
' Tommy Burns landed his first winner
at the meeting in the seven furlong sell
ing affair. He had the mount on Edgardo,
which was played down from 4 to 8 to 5.
It took some hard urging to get the brown
gelding to the front, but at the finish he
disposed of the 100 to 1 shot Bagdad hand
ily. Kitty Kelly, a well-backed one, took
show honors. â 
Following up this win Burns had the leg
up on Decoy, favorite for the mile and a
sixteenth run, and was never headed.
Bullman succeeded in getting left at the
post with Essence and .old Cromwell
downed Colonel Ballantyne a neck for the
place.
Figured an absolute certainty for the
final sprint by the handicappers. Danger
ous Maid was fortunate to win. She
passed Saul of Tarsus in the stretch and
was then extended to the last pound to
beat Matt Hogan a neck.
Track Notes.
After Pompino had won the third event,
entered to be sold for $300, he was bid up
to $700 by Tom Ryan, the Illinois turfman-
Sam Judge, his owner, let the gelding go
at that fisure.
At last Tommy Burns broke the ice,
finishing first on Edgardo and Decoy.
i The New California Jockey Club makes
the following announcement to horsemen
regarding future stake payments: A pay
ment of $25 is due on January 1 next on
the yearlings (coming two-year-olds) that
have been qualified to date in the Cali
fornia Futurity. This stake will be run
in December, next racing season, and has
IS750 added by the New California Jockey
Club. It will be worth about $20,000. A
similar payment of $75 is due at the same
time in the Western Produce Stakes, with
$5000 added by the New California Jockey
Club. This stake will be worth $10,000 and
will be run next March, during the present
racing season. Failure to make these
payments will, under the conditions of
the stake, declare the entry, as there are
no forfeits.
A splendid programme has been pre
pared for the edification of the big holiday
throng to-day. All interest, of course,
will center on the rich $3000 Christmas
handicap, in which the crack Watercure.
None's. Vesuvian, Autollght and Greyfeld
are numbered among the starters. It will
be one of the greatest contests of the sea

the proprietors of poolrooms and bucket
shops operating in Denver and the Den
ver Mining Stock Exchange, through the
Sheriff, that they must discontinue busi
ness at once. The poolroom operators,
who have been protected against the city
authorities by an injunction Issued some
months ago by Judge Palmer of the same
court, say they will obey Judge John
son's order, as Judge Palmer's injunction
does not apply to the county authorities.
The others affected, however, declare the
court has no right to make such an order
in their case and that they shall open
for business as usual Thursday morning.
Besides the poolrooms the following were
served with Judge Johnson's i notice to
day:
1 Denver Mining Stock Exchange, L. M.
Davidson, John G. Morgan, Brokerage
Company and W. B. Ray.
It is said others will be served on
Thursday.
Judge Johnson said to-night that he
should probably take no further action
in the matter until the cases have been
investigated by the Grand Jury, which is
now in session.

SMALL JOY TO BRITONS
London Editors Comment on the Fact
That the War Is Not
Ended.
LONDON. Dec. 25.â "Christmas 'for the
third year in succession finds the country
engaged in war," is the burden of the edi
torials in the London papers this morning
and regrets are expressed that the casual
ty lists issued to-day totals forty-nine
men killed and seventy-one wounded. Sat
isfaction, however, is found in the fact
that the process of attrition brings the
end of the struggle perceptibly nearer.
Compensation is likewise found in the
undiminished loyalty displayed by the
columns. . . â¢
Christmas brought a change of weather
conditions in Europe, where the severe
frost and -snow have given way to cold
rain and sleet. â¢ In London the wretched
weather threw a considerable gloom over
the festivities. Shopkeepers suffered
heavily, as the downpour kept thousands
of people indoors.
Among the great cities of the world
New York is regarded as having the
preatest cause to rejoice for material
prosperity. Rome and St. Petersburg are
fairly prosperous, but Paris, Berlin and
Vienna are all suffering from bad trade
conditions.
The Prince and Princess of Wales pre
sided yesterday at the annual distribution
of gifts, joints of beef, etc. to the tenants

with the members of the Board of Super
visors. Henry H. Lynch, who at present
holds the position of superintendent of
construction, will also be supplanted.
The Baltimore syndicate will make vast
improvements in its San Francisco
property. Residents of San Francisco are
under the impression that this city has
the finest street car service in the world.
The Eastern street car men claim, how
ever, that there ,ia room for great Im
provement and that they will make many
changes for, the betterment of the road.
They say they will put a large amount
of new rolling stock on the road and In
some districts they will shorten the time
between cars.
The syndicate is already making ar
rangements for an all-night car service
"Owl" cars, running at intervals of half
an hour, will be put on in a few months.
The Baltimore men claim that thia all
night service can be made to pay but
whether it does or not, they say, thev
see no reason why San Francisco as a
metropolitan city should not have as
good a service as cities of smaller popu
lation Jn the East. -

Robbers Explode Dyna

Resort.
Three Men Are Seriously In
jured and Considerable
Cash Is Stolen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Dec. 24.â The Totem gamb
l-.r.g hall, the largest green cloth estab
mg-ner.t in this city, was wrecked to
}.\.i by dynamite and at least $400 was
Mo*en. The immense hall was crowded
with devotees of fickle fortune, but strange
to say only three men were seriously in
jured. They were J. M. Slason. John
Ootts and Soren Nelson. Their injuries
consist of deep cuts and bruises on
lieads, arms and legs, inflicted by pieces
of metal from fhe stove, under which the
oyr.amite had been placed. Slason may
have sustained a fracture at the base cf
the skull, but it is too early to state ex
actly his condition.
Just how much money has been lost
irom the different bank rolls is not
Known by the proprietors themselves.
Manager Carter has several men at work
separating the gold and bank notes from
the debris. The play was heavv, and as
there were thousands of dollars in sight,
the presumption is that the house will
lose heavily.
Whether robbery or revenge was the
controlling motive of the dynamiters is
hard to say. if it was robbery, the pro
ject was trustrated to a large extent by
the tenacity of the electric light wires.
Looking like a scarecrow, the big arc still
shot out its rays after the explosion had
occurred and the crowd been thrown Into
a panic. One deliberate attempt to grab
the money from a table was frustrated
by the dealer. The man escaped. A sec
ond thief was more successful and got
away with at least $400.
The scenes attending the explosion
were as wild as those seen in a theater
vhen the cry "Fire!" Is heard. Men
filed and foucht with one another in
:\r mad desire to reach the door. The
was tilled with flying debris. Men
stretched out on the floor In all di
rections, while those who were only half
stunned were knocked right and left by
the maddened crowd. The police turned
out In full force with remarkable celerity
and succeeded in keeping back the crowd,
which filled the streets fcr two blocks.

DEATH CLOSES
A FAMOUS LIFE
Roberts, Who Discovered
Borax Mines, Passes
Away.
Prominent California Pioneer
Dies in a New York
Hotel. . .
NEW YORK. Dec. 24.â George D. Rob
erts of Oakland. Cal.. died to-day at the
Aldine Hotel in this city. He was 73 years
old and was one of the pioneers in the
mining industry of California. He has
two sisters living in Oakland. He had
been ill for some time.
George D. Roberts was born in Ohio In
1S28 and came to this State in 1S30. He
lived for a long time in Grass Valley and
was there engaged in the development of
the quartz mining industry. He was one
of the prime movers in the reclamation of
the tule lands along the Sacramento Riv
er, and gave his name to Roberts Island.
In later years Roberts outfitted an ex
pedition to Death Valley, and the result
of it was the discovery of the famous de
posits of borax. He was assuredly the
borax discoverer, developer and king out
in that "misty mid-region" of nowhere.
Millions have come from the fields of
borax treasure that Roberts located, but
not all of the wealth happened into the
pockets of the discoverer.
Roberts made a try for fortune In South
America, and when ' prospects were du
bious there he readily shifted himself to
Russia, then to Alaska and eventually to
California. He possessed a remarkable
ability to lead men in venturesome enter
prises. The financiers frequently made
a turn of the quotation, "Where Mac
gregor sits, there is the head of the ta
ble," "and read It, "Where Roberts leads,
there is the chance for fortune." And to
many of his followers in the quest for
cpulence that chance undoubtedly came.
Personally Roberts was a man of
charming manner, and his invariable
kind-heartedness won him innumerable
friends.
"COMPULSORY,
OR NOT AT ALL"
South American Nations
Discuss Arbitra
tion Plans. \
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 24.â Though the
Pan-American Conference as a whole will
undoubtedly fall back in the matter of
arbitration upon The Hague Convention,
it is learned that a number of the South
American nations will join among them
selves to sign a separate convention of
compulsory arbitration. Some of the na
tions who will eign the compulsory plan
will not refuse to sign the milder ar
rangement to be formulated by the con
gress, but others like Argentina are so
bent on compulsory arbitration that it is
claimed they will decline to sign any
thing less radical.
Nowhere is the Chile-Argentina dispute
followed with greater interest than In
Mexico just now. Articles setting forth
both sides of the dispute and supposed to
be inspired by the representatives of the
nations at the Pan-American Conference
appear dally in the press. If war were to
break out the conference would almost
certainly dissolve, as there is little ques
tion that the Argentina delegates and
those who sympathize with them would
withdraw.

Railroads and Ranchmen

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 24.â The railroads
and ranchmen of* the West have risen to

bluegrass is to Kentucky. The first essen
tial is a plant with hardihood to prosper
under the limited moisture from "Vains

grass must bear sufficient nutriment to
nourish stock and must not be too expen

In seeking the proper plant an experi
mental plan has been agreed upon. A
spot of 3000 acres in some centrally lo
cated section of the range country will be
fenced and of this thirty divisions will be
made for the trying-out of a6 many grass
seeds. There are now 120 varieties grow
ing in Nebraska and a test will be made
of the best of these. Tropic grasses will
also be Introduced and an abundance of
seeds for the purpose has already been
received from Africa and South America.
The co-operation of the Government
will be required at every step in the
undertaking. It must first give its con
sent to the fencing off of. several sections
of land and then when some class of
grasses have been proved a success the
Government will be asked to make an ox
tensive appropriation j for the purchase
and sowing of the seed throughout t'ie
range country. The Agricultural Depart
ment will be asked for advice and assist-

Industrial Agent Judson believes that
the experiment station will begin Its wwk
early in the spring and he has already ar
rived at important results relative to
seeding on his experimental farm near
Walla Walla. Wash. The ranges which
it is hoped to benefit, Judson says, lie in
Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, Utah,
Nevada and Idaho.
"The scheme for reseedlng," Judson
continues, "is in my opinion equally as
important as irrigation. It will be far
more extensive in its scope, also, as the
territory available for the application of
irrigation methods is limited. There Is
a definite limit to the tapping of streams
or the storing of water in reservoirs,
whereas the scope of reseeding is only
bounded by the extent of the Western
ranges. Â»
"As a result of the deterioration of tho
ranges In many cases it now requires
twice as many acres a year to provide
fodder for one sheep as formerly. .The
principal cause of the trouble lies with
the sheep, for what they do not dig out
with their sharp teeth they punch In with
their equally keen hoofs. When they are
bunched as they are all through the
West they completely stamp out all
growths save the sage brush."

THE beautiful custo.m^ of^singing
Christmas carols , in -the pleading
hotels was carried out last night
by the boy choir of the Cathedral
Mission of the Good Samaritan.
For seven years past on Christmas cVe
this charming custom has prevailed, and
on each occasion large concourses were
delighted by the fresh young voices raised
In song.
The opening carols were sung at the
Palace at 8 o'clock. The rotunda was
sparkling with vari-colored incandescent
lights and presented a beautiful specta
cle. In the rotunda stood a magnificent
Christmas tree thirty-five feet high, and
fairly covered with lights of red, white,
blue, yellow, green and amber colors. At
the top was a flaming Star of Bethlehem,
the whole presenting a beautiful specta
cle, worthy of the enterprise of the man
agement and skill of Edgar C. Gribbin,
the Palace electrician.
The thirty members of the boy choir
took their places Immediately beneath'
the tree, and under the direction of Miss
Elizabeth Brown sans a number of old
carols, including "Hark, the Herald An
gels Sing," "Adeste Fidelis," "Good King
Wencelas" and "Noel." A large crowd
thronged the rotunda, while the floors
above were filled with guests who had
gathered to enjoy the sweet strains. Each
carol was applauded, and when Rev. J.
P. Turner, j-ector of the mission, gave the
signal to cease, the audience regretfully
departed. . â¢ ' ., .
The choir next visited the St. Nicho
las, where the same programme was ren
dered before' a large and delighted gath
ering. â  The Pleasanton was then treated
to a few carols, and in quick succession
the Bella Vista. California, Russ. Lick
and Occidental were visited. At the latter
hotel the members of the choir were
treated to a bountiful supper at 11 o clock
by Major Hooper. At each of the hotels
visited the singing of the young choris
ters was heartily admired.

ond and Mission streets. At the regular
Christmas services to-day the sermon will
be preached by Bishop Nichols. A fine

FIRE DESTROYS
COSTLY WORKS
Southern Pacific Creo

Burned.
HOUSTON, Tex., Dec. 24.â The immense
creosoting works of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, ' located two miles be

flre to-day.
The plant extended about six blocks in
length along the Texas and New Orleans
tracks- and was a place of almost con

will reach about Â§100,000. The value of
the plant was estimated at $72,000 and the
amount of material destroyed will reach
from $15,000 to $30,000. No insurance was
carried and the loss falls wholly upon the
company. â¢
The fire broke out at 10:30 o'clock this

TEKRIBLE DEATH RATES
IN RECONCENTRADO k CAMPS
In the Boer reconcentrado camp at
Standerton the number of prisoners under
8 years of age during the month of April
was 1137. The death rate was 255 per 1000
per annum.
In the camp at Irene there were 4102
prisoners under S years of age during the
month of May. The death rate was '00
per 1000 per annum. In June there were
4i>00 young prisoners, and the death rate
among them was 366 per 1000 per annum.
â¢ In the Johannesburg camp there were
3170- children during April, and the dea-h
rate among them was 349 per 1000 per an
num. In May there were 3285 children In
that camp, and the death rate was Â£25 p*r
annum. â¢ â 
, In the Bloemfontein camp, with 4339
prisoners, the death rate of men, women
and children from April 2 to JulÂ£ 2 was
309 per 1000 per annum.
In Kroonstad from April 1 to May IS the
death rate was 195, and from May 26 to
June 23 it was 213 per 1000 per annum of
men, women and children. The prisoners
In Bloemfontein and Kroonstad numbered
7007. .
The committee appointed by the Con
sular corps representing foreign nations
in the Transvaal reported:
Firstâ That the death percentage In the
camps surpasses all hitherto known pro
portions.
Secondâ That the death rate amounts to
fourteen times that of Pretoria, which
has, according to Dr. Stoud. an average
of 25 per 1000 a. year. '
Thirdâ That the death rate among the
children confined to the camps has in
creased to an alarming extent.
Since the above figures were compiled
the death rate has continued to increase
to "an alarming extent." The number cf
children that died in the camps during
August Is placed at 1964. If continued tor
one year at that rate scarcely a Boer child
under 8 years of age will be left alive in
the camps. â 
Gloss over such a Btate of affairs as one
will, it is simply wholesale murder. It
equals the horrors of Weyler's camps in
Cuba, which spurred this nation to war
with 'Spain. The acquiescence- of a ma
jority of the British public on the policy
of extermination is the most amazing
part of it.
Russia has a woman Inventor of a flying

CHILE AND ARGENTINA.
DESPITE the reports that Argentina and Chile
are willing to submit their quarrel to the ar
bitration of King Edward, and the reassur
ing statements made from time to time by the rep
resentatives of the two Governments at Washing
ton, those who are most familiar with the situation
assert that an outbreak of war is far more probable
than the establishment of a lasting peace, no matter
how wisely the controversy may be conducted. Be
tween the people of the two nations there has long
been a rivalry for supremacy, and it is believed that
nothing short of a war ending in the virtual sub
jection of one of them can definitely settle it.
The two nations have a common frontier running
through the Andes Mountains for more than thirty
degrees of latitude. In some places the boundary
line is not clearly defined and consequently there are
frequent occasions for dispute. The present contro
versy has arisen from such a conflict and turns upon
the assumed right of Chile to construct roads over a
strip of territory whose ownership is disputed. It is
said, however, that neither country cares very much
about the district in question, which is of little value,
and were the two peoples friendly the issue could be
easily adjusted. The danger lies in the fact that each
side is eager for war and the Governments are find
ing it difficult to arrange for a settlement which will
not be offensive to their people. It is therefore a
popular antagonism rather than a question of state
that is at irsue, and it is upon that ground that doubts
rest as to the possibility of maintaining peace even
by the arbitration of King Edward.
The rivals are not unequally matched. Chile has
a population of about 3,000,000, and Argentina has
about 4,000,000, but to counterbalance the superior
numbers of Argentina, Chile has the advantage in
financial strength and in solidarity of institutions.
The debts for which the Argentine Republic is re
sponsible have been recently estimated at $550,000,
000, while the Chilean debt is but $125,000,000. The
burden of taxation is much higher in Argentina than
in Chile, and is made worse by the fact that in pro
portion to population the Chileans are wealthier than
their rivals. '
A war between the two states would be quite a
different affair from that which is threatened between
Venezuela and Colombia. Both Chile and Argentina
are occupied by descendants of .Europeans with but
a. small admixture of Indians. In all Argentina it is
estimated there are not more than 30,000 Indians and
the number in Chile is considerably less. A contest
between them would therefore be a contest between
vigorous, highly civilized men and would be a war in
earnest.
If the two countries could unite in the formation
of a federal republic, the result would be the estab
lishment of a nation of continental importance, for
while the joint population would not much exceed
7,000,000 it would unquestionably increase rapidly
through immigration as well as by birth, and in a
lime comparatively short the power of the joint rc
public would be formidable enough to make itself
felt even in world politics. It appears, however, that
the animosity existing between the two renders it im
possible to arrange a union, A long and costly war
would probably convince them sooner than anything
else that :t is better to unite than to fight. At any
rate so long as each believes itself to be invincible
and looks upon the other with something of con
tempt as well as of hatred, there is no prospect of
getting either to agree upon terms of union that
would be fair to the other.
It is to be noted tjiat in each country there is a
strong foreign population that desires peace, and
moreover the holders of the bonds of the two Gov
ernments will exert their utmost influence to prevent
the outbreak of a war that might seriously impair
the power of either Government to pay itÂ£ debts. The
hope for peace therefore is not altogether a forlorn
one, notwithstanding the clamor for war from the
masses on each side. The task of the arbitrators in
fact will be difficult indeed, but not impossible.
Sometimes money talk is more potent than war talk.
If Carnegie will only watch closely how Congress
deals with the surplus he will get a. good pointer

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
MAN measures life, and time by anniversaries and events. In the calendars of all
nations and races' that have accomplished * civilization, or have seen it in a
vision, are periods- counted as a time of- reflection, retrospection, introspection
and of high resolve. -
In the Christian calendar that season is with us to-day, and will be moving the
minds and hearts of men from this day, which marks the beginning of an efa, to the
companion anniversary which emphasizes the commencement of a year. In the spirit of
the time The Call hails all its readers and all men. everywhere, with the compliments
of the season. ' â â '*' >'â  â¢â 
The world is as right as it has ever been and has in it more people who are right,
or desire to be, than ever before since it began turning on its axis and spinning through
space in its orbit. That all things and all men are not as right as they ought to be in the
light of these advanced days should furnish no excuse for pessimism. In all foretimes
the world has had light in some degree, and there have been men and nations that have
not lived in its luster. But this has not- restrained humanity from investing its genius in a
greater illumination, nor- will that genius be restrained now by like causes.
Man knows better how to live than ever before. Men are more generally enlight
ened. The space to be measured between the highly cultivated many and the less culti
vated few is growing less every year* and is narrower to-day than ever. Let us hope that
the march of man onward will finally entirely pass it, and that all knowledge and wis
dom and power will be the endowment of all men. Let us hope, too, that in that day
when a great light shall be upon all and within all, men will so comprehend equity and
conduct that the time foretold in metaphor will be here, and swords will be beaten into
plowshares and spears into pruning hooks, and the lion and the lamb will rest together,
and the bear eat straw like an ox. It means that in the condition toward which 'the world
moves, slowly sometimes, deviously sometimes, perhaps unwillingly sometimes, the traits
of cruelty, injustice, savagery and selfishness, which man ; took from the brute in his long
evolution to self-consciousness, are fading away. r :
Every year there is in the world more charity to > the poor and less need for it; in
the courts more justice, and in proportion to the world's increase in men less call for it.
The glacial ignorance which wrapped the human mind in the ice age of perception is
thawed away, and the sun of enlightenment warms a soil every year richer in returns. In
this season of high anniversaries the world is more profoundly shocked by less profound
offenses against the rule of right than ever before. Men are restrained from offending by
the mere dread of the judgment of their fellows. Nations still play with the sword hilt,
they draw the blade, and sometimes smite with it. But they pay tribute to the world's
advance in the simple precepts of Christianity by following the flow.of blood with a dec
laration of the ultimate benevolence of their purpose. As some see in this the danger^. of
associating Christianity with the relentless purposes of ambition, using it as the cloak to
a sinister purpose, until cloak and what it covers come to seem identical, and the ser
mon on the mount and the beatitudes lose by the association, there are others, the true
seers and prophets of the time, who rescue, the panoply that is inscribed with peace on
earth and good will toward men, and carry it back to the sanctuary.
The fact that ambition tries to seem a virtue by- putting Christianity between it
and the world's condemnation is a tribute to the refuge it seeks as the mantle that may
cover sin. â¢
In this season California- felix, the happy, salutes the world. Her basket is full,
her store replete, her cup running over. Mercy and charity are abroad in her borders,
seeking out the lame and halt and blind, the disinherited of fortune and those that be sick,
to flood their days with a halcyon sunshine and make their ways pleasant, ease their pains
and lift sorrow from them. And mercy and charity, as they go hand in hand, bearing the
horn of plenty, rejoice that its stores are greater than the needs they are to supply, and
the ministers of humane help turn their ear to the cry that may come .from beyond the
border, and the need, no matter how distant, is supplied and the voice, no matter how
weak, is heard like the call of a trumpet. Our wealth of sunshine, of tinted sky and land
scape, embowered and beautiful, are the outward and visible signs of the wealth of good
feeling, and spirit of unselfish sacrifice, that are the endowment of our great people. So
to them and to theirs, and to the world because they are part of it, the compliments of
the season.
SENATORIAL SECRECY.
ALMOST every man of original force who
enters the United States Senate distinguishes
his first term by some effort to reform the
practices of that ancient and venerable body. The
efforts of course are no more successful than that
of the boy who tried to teach his grandmother to
suck eggs, but they are none the less interesting,
and sometimes instructive.
Senator Clapp, the new member from Minnesota,
is the latest adventurer in the way of trying to in
duce the Senate to alter its ways. He seems to be a
clever man, this Senator from Minnesota, for in
stead of making a grave or vehement argument for
the reform he wishes, he sought to bring it about
by irony and sarcasm. After reading in the morn:
ing papers the first day's reports of what had taken
place in secret session with reference to the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, Senator Clapp introduced a reso
lution stating in effect that whereas the published
reports upon the question of ratification were not as
full Is they ought to be, and whereas the speeches
could be more fully reported if taken down by short
hand, therefore further discussion of the treaty
should be in open session.
The logic of the resolution is indisputable. - The
formality of holding an executive session on such a
question was hardly more than a farce. There was
no reason why the session should have been secret,
and that fact was recognized by the Senators them
selves, who promptly gave out a summary of all that
had happened. So far as secrecy is concerned the
discussion of the treaty might as well have been open
from start to finish.
Of course there are some matters that should be
discussed in secret and the secret shouid be kept.
Such matters, however, are rare. It is but seldom
our country has to engage in a treaty whose terms
may not just as weil be known to all the world,
and as a consequence there is not much use in hold
ing secret sessions tp consider ordinary treaties.
Of course Senator Clapp's resolution is not going
to bring about a "change in the Senate proceedings.
It did not even disturb them for a single day. It
was safely referred to a committee by which it has
been put into a pigeon hole or a waste basket, and
the Senate will never hear of it again. In fact the
next time a new Senator comes forth to suggest im
provement Senator Clapp himself will be among the
sages who "sit' on him." v ,;
There is . a report in the East that the school
teachers are .trying to get- themselves organized as
a branch of the Federation' of Labor for the purpose
of getting protection against politicians, and should
they do so and then strike for higher wages there
will be lots of business on the hands of the great
national arbitration committee.
. President Roosevelt is not Santa Claus, but all the
same he has many a gift to bestow just now, and
they run all the way from little sinecures up to Cabi
net positions; so it goes without saying there are
a good many stockings hanging around the White
House where he can see them/ ; UÂ«
The question that is probably most troublesome to
Lord Kitchener just now is whether he can finish
up the Boers in time to attend the coronation cere
monies in London, or whether he will have to send
his regrets.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1901.
SOME. time ago an eccentric Frenchman left by
will a considerable estate, the income of which
was to be employed by trustees in providing
each year, marriage portions for the handsomest
couples who were wedded in the district. The object
of. the testator was to promote marriage and to as
sist in improving the French race by encouraging
the wedding of young people who were most likely
to produce strong and handsome children.
The eccentricity of the will, taken in connection
with the prolonged discussion concerning the alleged
weakening of the French race, led to its being re
ceived with much more seriousness than it deserved.
One of the effects, however, has been that of bring
ing to light a good deal of information concerning
the results of marriages made for the definite pur
pose of improving the race. It appears that such
marriages have been by no means successful, and
that the law of natural selection which inclines men
and women to marry solely because of a mutual
love for one another is much better for thfe race
than any system of matchmaking that has yet been
devised by pure reason. .
In a letter on the subject to the London Times
Mr. Harris, who was formerly British Consul for
Denmark, contributes from the history of that coun
try an interesting illustration of the folly of these
"improved marriages." He states that serfdom. was
not abolished in Denmark until 1788 and that some
years ' before that date a Danish soldier of fortune
returned from the East Indies and purchased a large
estate in Jutland. Having a desire to improve the
race and believing he could achieve it in much the
same way that breeds of cattle and of horses were
then being improved, he made the handsomest young
man in his parish marry the # handsomest young
woman, and paired the others according to their
merits. The - result was a complete failure. The
Consul says the unhappiness of the marriages became
a proverb throughout Denmark and the folly of the-
experiment is still remembered.
Such marriages as may be. made for the sake of
getting portions of the annual revenue from the
estate of the eccentric Frenchman may be more for
tunate than those imposed by the Danish reformer,
for they will at least be voluntary, but it is safe

TO SEND HER ABROAD
MISS EMMA BOWKER, A GIRL. WITH A "HEAVENLY VOICE," WHO
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MRS. SAGE AND MRS. KEENE,

EMMA BOWKER is looked upon as
the luckiest girl in all the Rock
aways, for in addition to the fine
dress- that a millionaire's wife gave
her so she might sing at a social function
she is to be sent next month to Europe,
where she is to be given a musical edu
cation, writes the Far Rockaway corre
spondent of the New York Herald.
Emma Bowker is still in her teens and
is considered the prettiest girl in Inwood,
the little hamlet that for a few short
months was a part cf Greater New York.
She lives with her father, a painter, in a
little frame house which shelters a family
of nine. The Bowkers have not been
overblessed with this world's goods, and,
while one brother drives an ice wagon,
the mother is not too proud to go out
scrubbing to help educate and clothe her
children.
Emma went away about a year ago to
join the Salvation Army, believing that
she would have her voice trained, but
tambourine accompaniments in the open
air were not what she had expected, and
so she returned home and settled down
to home life and a seat in the choir of

FRAXCO-GERMAN WARS.
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee of
the German army recently summed up the
result of 700 years of fighting betwen
France and Germany. "The figures prove
to my mind not only the folly of war in
general." pays Von Waldersee, "but like
wise that French and Germans are quits."
Here is the grand total of victories and
defeats, with the number of men killed
and wounded on the battle field for both
countries:
Frenchmen killed and wounded by *
Germans ..*.: 1,100,520
Germans killed and wounded by
Frenchmen 1,057.780
v N'umber of French, victories over
Germans 235
Number of German victories over
French 240
The Germans, on the whole, have had
five more victories than the French, and
have killed 42,740 more of their antagonists
than their antagonists have killed of
them.
The five extra victories, Count von Wai-"
derseo believes, may be accounted for by
the fact that the French have nearly al
ways fought single handed, while the
Germans have hud from two to three al
lies.
Both nations have lost about the same
number of men in battle, but French mor
tality has been greater owing to fevers
and epidemics. It seems a strange fact
that the two countries have hammered
away 'at each other for over seven cen
turies without any actual results, so far
as statistics of slaughter are concerned.
The French have gained exactly as many
fortresses as the Germans have won
sieges. Both nations have been forced to
honorable surrender an equal number of
times.â Cincinnati Enquirer.

Dr. Edward Octavus Flagg, a close
friend of Bishop Potter, had been spend
ing the summer here, and was Invited to
preach the McKinley memorial service.
He had read the first scriptural lesson,
when from the organ loft there came such
a voice of sweetness and sympathy as he
had never heard before.
"Nearer, My God, to Thee," was the
solo, and before it was half finished the
entire congregation was sobbing. The aged
divine was so impressed that he could not
continue with the service for several min
utes, and then it was to offer a prayer of
p*raise for the inspiration received from
the "heavenly voice."
After the service Dr. Flagg talked with
the singer, who was MIs3 Bowker, an3
learned, of her ambitions, and the second
day following she had sung for Mrs.
James R. Keene, Mrs. Russell Sage, Mrs.
.Daniel Lord and others.
It was decided at once to give the girl a

she is now preparing for the trip.

tate or property held by the lessee under
a lease from the owner, and the term is

judgment In the matter of contrast and
distribution of colors, be acquainted with
perfumery, cosmetics and all that la requi
site for a lady's toilet, be ready with the
needle and expert in the art of millinery-

ESPIRITO SANTO-Eugenia, City. The
flower called the Espirito Santo or Hob-
Ghost flower is said to be one of the most
extraordinary flowers that grows. It
blossoms in tho conservatory of Golden-
Gate Park. It Is described in the follow
ing language: "The blossoms are of ala
baster whiteness, in form like the tulip,
with powerful perfume like the magnolia.
Resting within the cup of the flower, so
marvelously formed that no human skill,
be it ever so cunning, could excel the re
semblance, lies the prone image of a dove.
Its exQUisitely molded pinions hang Hfe-
Iessly from its side; the head bends gently
forward; the tiny bill, tipped with a deli
cate carmine, almost touches it3 snow
white breast, while the expression of the
entire Image seems the very Incarnation
of meekness and ethereal innocence."
THE PRESIDBNCY-Subscriber, City.
There is nothing in the constitution of the
TTnited States -which says that the Vlce-
Presldent shall take the oath of office In
case of the death of the President. The
constitution says: "In case of the removal
of the President from office, or of his
death, resignation or inability to discharge -
the powers and duties of the said office,
the same shall devolve upon the Vice-
President." From this language It follows
that should the President temporarily "JL>
Incapacitated the Vice-President would
perform his duties, and he could not, while
the President was living, take the oath of
office as President; still he would dis
charge the duties of the office. It Is
claimed that there is no necessity for the
Vice-President to take the oath of office
as President on succeeding the President
after his death, but that it is done to avoid
any question that might be raised.
SAGO-A., Porterville. Cal. Sago ia a
variety of starch obtained from the pith
of the stems of the sago palm, an Ea3t
Indian tree -which grows in lowlands in
all the Islands of that part of the world.
It !s a low tree with a thick trunk, of
which the woody part is an Inch or two
inches only in, thickness, the whole cav
ity being filled at certain stages of its
growth with the farinaceous pith. This
is mixed with water, which is passed
through sieves, and the starchy matter
is allowed to settle. The water la then
run off and the flour, after being dried,
is put into little basket* made of sago
leaves. The produce of a tree is 750 pounds
of flour. A large quantity of sago flour
la shipped annually to the markets, where
It is purified and fitted for use as stay/h
in calico and the other manufactures, in
Borneo much of the starch is granulated
and the Chinese of Malacca prepare pearl
sago. The method of pearllns and granu
lating sago 13 not known to Europeans.
Sago not belns entirely soluble in hot
water, -it can therefore, be used in thj
making of puddings, etc.; and in that way
forms a valuable article of food, cheap,
light, nutritious and easy of digestion.
/PLACES BLAME
ON CONDUCTOR
Railway Company Holds
Him Responsible for
Accident.
Assistant Superintendent of
Road Says Phelps Un
coupled Car.
Fixing the responsibility of the Fill
more street car accident of Monday night
is the particular labor of the street rail
road company, and it is about decided
that Conductor M. B. Phelps Is entirely
responsible. Assistant superintendent
Stein of the Market-street system has this
to say of the company's findings, after
an official investigation:
"We examined the apparatus used by
the cars in the descent and ascent on Fill
more street between Broadway and Green
street and it was in perfect order, show
ing that no defect In the mechanism
could have been responsible for the acci
dent. Timekeeper Cameron was on the
top of the hill directing the cars and he
ordered car No. 757 to make the descent.
On account of the blockade this car was
just one trip behind and was ordered
back to Bay street and then to move
southward. Conductor Phelps, out of
habit, may have uncoupled the car. You
see, he came up the hill and was to go
down again, the passengers changing at
Green street for a south-bound car.
Phelps said he did not uncouple the car,
but he wavers under cross examination.
It is certain that the car was uncoupled."
Phelps says he did not uncouple the
car.
No matter where the responsibility lies
the street car company will be in the
throes of several damage 6Uits when the
new year rolls around. Already the rail
road's lawyers have been showing great
activity in attempting to secure a settle
ment with the injured passengers.
A. T. Deutschmann. the motorman of
the runaway car, was arrested yesterday
morning and charged with manslaughter.
He was released on $50 cash bail. Con
ductor Phelps was arrested during the
afternoon and also released on the same
amount cf bail.
A coroner's jury will hold an inquest
en the body of Miss Mary Phelan, who
succumbed to injuries resulting from the
accident.
Mrs. Mary Kelly, a domestic in the em
ploy of Edward Lichtenberg, â who was
taken to St. Mary's Hospital immediately
after the collision, suffered greatly from
the shock. Her foot was severely crushed,
but last night she rested easily and' the
hospital physician expressed every hope
for her ultimate recovery. Mrs. M. K.
Mansie, who resides at 2111 Pierce street,
was resting easily at the Southern Pacific
Hospital last night. She, too, received an
injury to her right foot, a part of which
may have to be amputated.
TEMUBREBS TO OFFICERS'
SUITS ARE OVERRULED
Judg-e Hebbard Decides Tliat Statute
cf Limitation Does Not Pre

iV-^-'-^rs interposed by City At
ttSgAgnCjCnft to the suits for reinstate
-iifcd i*y citrht policemen who were
f--r:iÂ£?ed from ihÂ« force within the last
.. pears wtfÂ« overruled by Judge
Hebbird yesterday. The suits were de
murred to on the ground that the causes
â were barred by the statute of limitations
snd that the complaint did not state suf
iicient cause of action. The men affected
by the decision of Judge Hebbard are
Patrick J. Jones. John J. Allen, Jere
rniah McCarthy, Joseph Knright, Corne
lius J. Kelly, Andrew Briggs, John Gil
foy and W. J. Shields.
The suits demurred to are for writs of
rnandate to compel the Police Commis
sioners to restore the men to the force.
They claim that they were dismissed ar
bitrarily. Judge Hebbard holds that the
board has not the power to remove tho
men without a hearing. In rendering his
decision yesterday he paid:
"I do not believe that the Supreme
Court meant to say that the board might
po act, and I believe when the occasion
arises that the court, while affirming the
principle that the power to appoint im
plies power to remove, it will not decide
that the newly appointed Board of Police
Commissioners may arbitrarily remove all
of the members of the force they find on
duty and fill their places with new men
simply because It has the power to re
move. Such ought not to be the law and
such is not the law."

COST OF WATER
SUPPLY RAISED
Grunsky Charged With
Adding to Tuolumne
Estimate.
Public Utilities Committee to
; Begin Inquiry Into
Â«jv â¢ . Allegation.
Public' Utilities Committee of the
Bofflcd .of Supervisors will begin an in
vestigation to-morrow into an allegation
that City Engineer Grunsky arbitrarily
raised the estimate of cost of the Tuo
lumne River water supply project as re
turned by Luther Wagoner, field assis
tant in charge of the water investigation
up to July 1, 1901, who made the prelimi
nary report on the subject
The committee has received information
that the figures compiled by Wagoner
were increased by Grunsky by nearly
$9,000,000, and that the last named offi
cial assigned no particular reasons for
making the changes. So important does
the committee consider the allegation that
it has subpenaed Wagoner to appear be
fore it to-morrow afternoon at its regu
lar meeting, when he will be questioned as
to the manner in which he arrived at the
results which were subsequently changed
by Grunsky.
In City Engineer Grunsky's recent re
port, in which he' recommended that the
Tuolumne River project be accepted by
the city as a municipal water supply, he
pieced the estimated cost of the project
at $38,000,000 to deliver 60,000,000 gallons
daily to this city. The cost of deliver
ing GO.OOO.OOO gallons per day through a
double pipe line via Livermore Pass was
estimated by Field Assistant Wagoner
to be $29,260,000.
The Utilities Committee will demand
that Grunsky give specific reasons for
making the increased estimate. It will
also seek information as to why Wagon
er's estimate on the cost of a tunnel un
oer Carquinez Straits was raised 40 per
cent.
Another line of inquiry to be pursued by
the committee will be the allegation made
by C. R. Alberger, one of the promoters
of the Giant Gap supply, that the data
in connection with the watershed of the
Tuolumne River is now on file in the of
fice of the United States Coast and Geo
detic Survey. Alberger avers that had
this "been obtained by the Board of Pub
lic Works it would have saved the city
several thousand dpllars in prosecuting a
similar investigation. .
"It is true," said Supervisor Reed,
chairman of Public Utilities Committee, in
an interview, "that our committee has re-,
ceived information that Field Assistant
uagoner's figures were raised by City
Engineer Grunsky in computing the cost
of the Tuolumne River project. We de
sire to probe the matter, as It is of too
great importance to be overlooked. Now
that the least technicality may invalidate
the Issuance of bonds for public utilities,
it will be the aim of the committee to
straighten out any entanglements that
may arise before taking final action
thereon."
JOY AT GERMAN HOSPITAL.

OUSTED TEACHER MAKES
AN APPEAL TO MAYOU
Mrs. Geraldine Donovan-Boyle Al
leges She Was Consolidated Out
of Position Illegally.
Mrs. Geraldir.e Donovan-Boyle sent a
communication yesterday to Mayor Phe
lan appealing to his Honor to Investigate
her alleged Illegal dismissal from the
school department by the Board of Edu
cation. In her communication Mrs. Boyle
recites that about a year ago, when she
was Miss Donovan, she -was consolidated
out of her position in tho Richmond Even
ing School. Two days after her dismis
sal another class was formed in the school
iind a teacher regularly assigned there
to.
After some time Mrs. Boyle was placed
on substitute duty, but upon her mar
riage one month ago she was denied . a
leave of absence and has been deemed
to be out of the department entirely. She
was further given to understand by Presi
dent Kincaid that the board did not -wish
teachers to marry and still continue in
the department. Mayor Phelan promised
Mrs. Boyle that he would make a per
sonal inquiry into the merits of her al
legations.
GEORGE EATON OBDERED
TO RENDER ACCOUNTING
Assignee of '.'Mammy" Pleasant Must
Show Causs Why He Should
Not Be Removed.
George R. Eaton, assignee of the estate
of "Mammy" Pleasant, was ordered by
Judge Trout yesterday to file within the
next five days an accounting of his stew
ardship. He has had charge of the old
colored woman's estate for two years, and
during that time has not filed any record
of his receipts and disbursements.
Judge Troutt's order is the result of a
petition for the removal of Eaton filed a
few days ago. It is claimed by the cred
itors cf Mrs. Pleasant that Eaton has not
been giving the estate proper attention
and Judge Troutt was petitioned to dis
charge him and appoint Oliver Roberts,
a local mining man, as his successor.
Mrs. Pleasant's creditors claim that she
is worth at least $250,000. '
General Smith Back From 'Washington
General James Smith, who went to
Washington to consult with the Federal
authorities on Philippine affairs, returned
to this city yesterday and is at the Cal
ifornia Hotel. General Smith reports that
the administration's policy In the matter
of the islands will prove satisfactory to
the natives.
A number of the gentlemen composing
the reception committee last night con
sulted with General Smith relative to a
reception to be given in his honor, and
while no positive agreement was reached
it is likely that the reception will not
long be deferred. -
Substantial Donations Beceived.
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, president of the
Children's Hospital, reported last night
that the donations of the past three days
aggregated $4361 50. In addition to this
sum a check for $3000 was received from
the executors of the estate of the late
Miss Anna Cohn, she having bequeathed
that sum to the Institution.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1901.
SHIP C. F. SARGENT AGAIN AFLOAT
AND IS DEEMED OUT OF DANGER
Work of Pumping the Water Out of Her Is Being Done
by Her Own Machinery and She Will Be Ready for
Docking : To-Morrow â Her Hull May Be Uninjured
THE ship C. F. Sargent is still in
Mission bay. She is afloat, but
her hold is nearly full of water
and the donkey engine and wind-
mill are kept busy freeing the
lower decks of water. All danger as to
fire has passed and the tugs were with
drawn early on Monday. Then the ves
sel's â  own pumps began work and by
noon yesterday the Sargent was afloat.
There is now little or no danger and the
chances are that when the vessel is
docked she will be found to be practically
undamaged. The pumps and windmill
are keeping her clear of water and the
chances are that she will dock at Rosen
feld's bunkers on Thursday and begin
discharging. . â¢
CAPTAIN MtLES REMEMBERED.
Quartermaster of Transport Sheridan
Given a Loving Cup.
There was a very pleasing ceremony
aboard the transport Sheridan yesterday.
Quartermaster Captain Miles is to leave
the vessel at the end of the year and will
report at Fort Niagara for duty. He will
be succeeded by Quartermaster Captain
H. P. Young.
Yesterday the officers of the transport
got together and presented Captain Miles
with a loving cup. It was a beautiful
piece of work and bore the following in
scription:
A token of love and . esteem to Perry L.
Miles, captain Fourteenth Iniantry, U. S. A.,
transport quartermaster United States army
transport Sheridan, by the following officers:
G. H. Pierce, captain; Robert S. Paul, chief

penter, chief steward; Harry Merry, second
steward; Stephen Wythe, surgeon; Harry B.
Strauss, quartermaster's clerk; J. C. Rode
haver, commissary clerk, and John E. Bauer,
freisht clerk.
San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 25, 1901.
Captain Miles has been in the transport
service ever since the war began. He
was with the Warren for nearly a year
and a half and with the Sheridan since
last February. He "Is one of the best
liked quartermasters in the service and
his retirement to regular army service
will be regretted by all his friends on
the Sheridan and Warren.
Entertained His Friends.
Captain T. A. Nerney of the training
ship Marion had a number of guests out
with him on the bay yesterday. Among
them were Herman Schaffner and wife;
Walker A. Graves, past supreme repre
sentative of the Knights of Pythias, and
wife; George W. Bauer; Ogden H. Feth
ers, supreme chancellor of the Knights of
Pythias, and wife; Lieutenant Carl E.
Lindsay and wife, Miss Graham and Mrs.
S. B. Pearson. The launch made a tour
of the bay and made stops at Alcatraz,
Angel Island and the various revenue
cutters, finally bringing up at the Marion
about 4 p. m. The affair was a most en
joyable one.
Water Front Notes.
Quite a number of the Invercoe's crew
are down with the scurvy. The vessel
made a long run from Liverpool and
many of the men shipped at that port
had only just arrived from India. Three
of the men were removed to St. Mary's
Hospital yesterday, but the doctors have
no doubt that they will recover.
The Harbor Commissioners at yester
day's meeting decided to call for bids for
the dredging of Channel street.
"Colonel" Tom Burgoyne of the chief
warfinger's staff was the proudest man
on the front yesterday. All the "boys"
got together and purchased a handsome
cameo ring for him and when the pre
sentation was made by Percy Henderson
the 'old man" nearly broke down. He
could not make a suitable reply but did
manage to get out, "Boys, let's go and
take a drink." A more faithful or more
conscientious servant the State of Cali
fornia does not possess,
A cable to the Merchants' Exchange
states that the United States transport
Meade was In a typhon on December 10
Her boats were smashed and the cabins
Hooded, while the hospital was wrecked.
Luckily there were no patients in the

GEORGE STAACKE
LOSES HIS CASE
Supreme Court Upholds
Decision of Lower
Tribunal.
Confirms Opinion That He Is
Not Proper Executor of
Bell's Will.
George Staacke, who has made such
a hard legal fight to recover the position
of executor of the will of Thomas Beil,
from which he was removed by order of
the. Superior Court, has finally lost the
battle by decision of the Supreme Court.
Some time after Bell's death, his widow,
Teresa Bell, became convinced that the
estate was not being managed properly
and petitioned the Probate Court to re
move Staacke. He had a strong dis
taste for any such innovation and litiga
tion commenced. The evidence adduced
by Mrs. Bell at the former trial showed
that Staacke, as executor of the estate,
controlled some valuable property known
as Laguna Rancho, which was heavily
mortgaged to a Miss Thompson of New
York, for whom he was the agent. Hid
duties were naturally somewhat conflict
ing, and when the ranch, which is al
leged to be worth $100,000, was sold to tho
mortgagee for $58,000, Mrs. Bell concluded
that a change of executors would be ben
eficial.
The Supreme Court upholds the lower
court so far as Laguna Rancho is con
cerned, but cannot see that certain other
findings are warrlnted from the evi
dence. Staacke Is exonerated from the
accusation of criminal conduct, but his
stewardship of the estate Is character
ized as "mismanagement" and "neglect."
It is held therefore that the order of re
moval is just.
JANITORS WANT CIVIL
SERVICE EXAMINATION
Prepare to Complain to Mayor of
Commission's Delay in Setting
a Sate for Test.
The janitors of the City Hall are prepar
ing to call the attention of Mayor Phelan
to the dilatory tactics of the Civil Service
Commission in holding an examination
for positions as janitors. They will rep
resent that the commission has been in
existence for two years and yet has taken
no steps to put janitors under the civil
service.
The janitors say that the examination
would be a physical test only and that no
great preparations would have to be made
to put it into effect. If the examination
had been held the thirty-one janitors
at present employed in the City Hall and
Hall of Justice would have the protection
of the civil service provisions of the char
ter in the tenure of their positions. As
the matter stands they will now be sub
ject to the political changes in the mu
nicipal administration.
Mayor Phelan will be asked to order the
Civil Service Commission to hold an ex
amination for janitors immediately.

in a pistol fight near here on Sunday, was
a former resident of Farmington, San
Joaquin County, where his brother is a
capitalist. Drias had a fortune of $50,000
held in trust for him. Being of dissolute
habits, he was allowed only the interest.
Frank Cundy, who, it is said, started the
fight, is still at large. Drias* body will
be shipped to Farmington to-morrow.

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
Parasites Cause All Hair Troubles.
Nine-tenths of the diseases of the scalp
and hair are caused by parasitic germs.
The importance of this discovery by Pro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg, Germany, cannot be overesti-
mated. It explains why ordinary hair
preparations, even of the most expensive
character, fail to cure dandruff; because
they do not, and they cannot, kill the dan-
druff germ. The only hair preparation in j
the world that positively destroys the
dandruff parasites that burrow up the i
scalp into scaies called scurf or dandruff
Is Newbro's Herpicide. In addition to its
destroying the dandruff germ Herpicide is
also a delightful hair dressing, making
the hair glossy and soft as silk. "- â¢â¢-"*â

GEXESAXa SUMMARY.
Low i^Tnpcrafjres bkra continued through
out ihe crtat valleys cv.d alonj the coast, but
xycrrr.cr srcslber has prevailed in Southern Cal-
J'oruia. The Weather has been generally clear.
VUh occasional fogs. Severe frosts have oc
Â«"':rred la the central cn<3 northern portions of
tiie State. No rai:i has fallen during the week.
Plowing and seeding are progresses except
la some of the southern districts, where the
f-oi! is too dry for profitable cultivation. In
; onions of the centra! and northern districts
the pain acreage will be large and in some in
stances much greater than average, uu: In
otbrr sectior-s the acreage will be below aver
age if raJn does not fall soon. Grain continues
In . xcelient condition in most places, but its
errowth Is btir.g somewhat retarded by cool
weather. New grass has been damaged by
l.-osts in only a few places and green feed is
abundant. Garden truck has been seriously
li^ured by frost.
Ibex* is a lack of definite Information re
|a:d:r.j :ht damage to citrus fruits by the
fiosis of the preceding week. It Is probable
that oranges not protected by smudging were
considerably injured, and it is certain that
young orange orchards and nursery btock were
badiy damagtU. Vineyards and orchards are
In good condition.
Sacramento Valley â The weather has con
tijued about the same as during ihe preceding
veek, with tea:perature somewhat below noi
n.ai, heavy irosts and no rain. Very little
carnage has been done by the irosts except to
Â»;a.r<3tji truck. Green feed Is still plentiful in
most places and stock &re doing well. Ora.in
Is making good growth and is of healthy color.
Plowing and seeding are progressing. Pros
pects continue good fcr a large acreage of
train. Orchards and vineyards are in good
condition.
Coast and Bay Sections â Fair, cool weather
fcas i-oatiniica Curing the week, with heavy
Irosts in tome sections. New grass has been
damaged by the frosts in some places, but
gieen feed is still plentiful and stock are in
good condition. Grain has made rapid growth
aiicr 's looking strong and healthy. 'Plowing
and seeding are progressing. In some of the
eouihern counties tne soil is becoming rather
dry lor cultivating and rain would be benefi
cial. Pruning continues and orchards and
vineyards arc- in excellent condition.
Sen Joaquin Valley â The weather has con
tinued cold and generally clear during the
neck, with occasional fogs. Minimum tem
reratures of -0 and 21 degrees are reported in
several places, and severe frosts have been fre
quent throughout the valley. The damage to
citrus fruits lias been light, but a few oranges
remaining on the trees were ruined. Young
orange orchards and nursery stock have been
considerably injured ar.d tender plants and new
Erracs damaged. Grain has not yet been in
jured by the cold weather and is in good con
dition, but would be benefited by rain. Green
feed is plentiful. Plov.-ing and 6eeding con
tinu", tli6ugh slowly in sorne sections, and the
grain ecreagre v.-ill be considerably curtailed if
r<?.in <Jots not fall soon. Vineyard and orchard
work is projrrePFing.
bouthern California â The weather bas been
considerably warmer than during the preceding
(reek, and generally clear and pleasant, but
with cool, frosty nights !n some sections.
Grain and srass are being somewhat Injured
by continued cool weather and absence of rain.
T^o definite reports of the damage to citrus
fiuits by the severe frosts of the 13th and 14th
b.-ive been received. The correspondents at
Anaheim and North Ontario report very little
injury to oranges. The orange crop is matur
ing lapidly and heavy shipments are being
:: ..ir Rain is needed.
Eureka ijummary â The weather during the
fan week was favorable for farm work. The
Foil i? in good condition; plowing and seeding
progressed rapidly. Pasturage is good and
grain growing well.
Los Angeles Summary â Warmer. Rain

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nezv York Stock Market.
NSW YORK. Dec. 24.â To-day's aggregata
dealings were slightly In excess of those of
yesterday, principally by reason of the active
speculation for a Tall in . Sugar. The dealings
in the reneral market were In the hands of
professional traders and only a small part of
the day's operations originated ; outside the
board room. The late recovery in prices after
the steady downward tendency of the early
part of X^Â»c d&y 'ws.s sufficient to put the i?ro~
fesslonal stamp upon the day's market. Even
in Sugar, although thsre was obviously very
large liquidation, the largest traders on tha
Kxchange joined actively in the selling for
short account. There were sales of 1000 to
10.000 shares during the day by individual
brokers and some of the largest sellers bought
to cover before the close. The stock was
forced down at one time to 103^4, representing
a decline of <$i& lrom last night's level. The
demand from the shorts rallied it to 1OC94 and
the closing was at 105>4. representing a uet
loss of 3?i. The traders offered pessimistic
arguments of the very large accumulation of
stocks, the wiping out of a profitable margin
in the price and the threatening increase in
the production of beet sugar. Parallels were
drawn by the copper episode to point to the
inadequacy of the great industrial combinations
to regulate and control trade in staple products.
Meantime the copper market in London made
a turn irom its lone downward course and
rallied quite strongly. Amalgamated Copper
here resisted the general weakness pf the mar
ket and rose at one time ITs over last night,
closing with a net gain of %. There were a
few other stocks which made headway against
the prevailing depression, notably the Hocking
Valley stocks, which rose l',Â£ and 2% respect
ively for the common and preferred on the re
iterated rumor of the projected retirement of
the preferred. The etronsr movement in the
general list was based upon the expectation
that there would be a flurry in call money
during the day on account of the requirements
to carry over the holiday. The bears alf=o
counted upon the depressing Influence of con
tinued weakness in Sugar. The earlier rates
for call money proved to be the highest and
lenders who held out for the high rates found
themselves with funds unplaced. . The offer
ings of this residue carried the rate down be
low 6 per cent in the afternoon .and was the
effective factor in driving the shorts to cover.
The bears, however, showed a natural inclina-'
tion to gather in their day's profits before
Christroas. . The market was a. reflection of
the holiday season throughout. The closing
v,as fairly Eteady at the rally and with the
earlier losses mostly reduced to a fraction, ex
cept in St. Paul and Union Pacific, which were
under conspicuous pressure all day on account
of the uneasiness caused by the onslaught upon
Union Pacific interests in the public statement
by President Hill of the Great Northern. Lake
Erie and Western dropped 3% and the pre
ferred 4 points on single sales.
The bond market was dull and irregular.
Total sales, par value SI. 020.000.
United States 4s declined %. but all other
Issues advanced iÂ£ per cent on the closing call.

Poultry and Game.
Not for years have California Turkeys been
so scarce on the day preceding Christmas as
they were yesterday.' The total receipts of
the day did not exceed 15 tons, whereas in
previous ' years they have ranged from 50 to
2D0 tons. Of these meager receipts 10 tons
came in early in the morning and were at
once cleaned up. Of course the market went up
to fancy prices under this condition. There
were a good many frozen Eastern Turkeys in
second hands however, and they were drawn
upon by retailers in lieu of the home stock.
They, too, advanced, selling up to ISc as the
very top for the best. One straight car sold
at lCc down to almost anything. Live Turkeys
advanced in sympathy with the dressed stock,
and Turkey was king of Xhe. produce market.
4. car of Eastern live poultry came in. making
two thus far this week. The general 'poultry
market' was firm, as the scarcity in Turkeys
naturally created a demand for other fowl.
Game was also affected by the scarcity in
Turkeys and advanced slightly. Receipts were
100 sacks. * â  â

Ancient Use of Anesthetics.
A Chinese manuscript In the Paris li
brary proves that anesthetics for surgical
purposes were used In China 1700 yearj
ago. It states that when a surgeon con
ducted a Berlous operation he save a de
coction to the patient, who after a few
moments became aa insensible as If he
were dead. Then, as tho case required,
thhe surReon performed the operationâIn
cision or iiinputatlonâ and removed the
cause of the malady; then he brought to
gether and secured the tissues and ap
plied liniment*. "After a certain number
of days the patient recovered, without
hnving experienced the slightest pain dur
ing the operation."

CHRISTMAS JOY
FOR POOR FOLK
Eiks Provide Bountiful
Dinners For Needy
Families.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Droadway, Dec: 24.
Without ostentation or display -Oakland
Lodge No. 171, Benevolent aiid Protective
Order of Elks, to-day provided Christmas
dinners "for 1000 people in Oakland who
otherwise would be compelled to put up
with the meager fare that poverty in
sures.
None except'the few members of the
Jodge who were detailed for this pleasant
duty know who are the recipients of this
quiet charityâ none save the 275 families
that received the unsolicited bounty of
the lodge.
To every one of these families there
was sent to-day a basket containing a
big prime roast of beef, with tea or coffee,
sugar, vegetables galore, nuts, fruit and
all of the condiments .that go to make a
real, substantial Christmas dinner.
All day long teams laden with the
Christmas cheer were sent d"ut from the
Elks" lodge hall.
A private committee arranged for this
distribution. Not a person outside of
thia committee had knowledge of what
was being done.
Where the names came from or where
tho bountiful supplies went will ever re
main a secret with those who were
charged by the â  Elks' lodge with the
cheerful holiday message of joy.
Besides this, the Elks remembered two
of Oakland's prominent philanthropies.
They sent to the West Oakland Home, for
Children a bounteous supply of turkeys,
and they repeated their donation to the
King's Daughters' Home for Incurables.

HEART DISEASE
KILLS ACTRESS
Maude Miller, Daughter
of the Poet, Dies
in Oakland.
Failure of Theatrical Tour
Said to Have Hastened
Her Demise.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Dec. Zi.
Mrs. Maude McCormick, whom the pa
trons of the theaters knew as Miss Maude
Miller, tho actress, died this morning at
the Garfleld residence, 1805 Thirteenth
street, where she had been undergoing
treatment for heart trouble since her re
turn from a tour of the State a short
time ago. She was a daughter of Joaquln
Miller, ihe "poet of the Sierras."
Mrs. McCormick' s death was the result
of heart complications. The disease was
aggravated by hard work, for she worked
earnestly to succeed in her profession, of
which she was very fond. The tour that
last occupied her attention turned out to
be a failure, and the disappointment from
which she suffered is believed to have
hastened her death.
The actress' life was not altogether a
happy one. Just after attaining her ma
jority she married a man named McCor
mick. in opposition to the wishes of her
father, from whom she was estranged for
a lonjj time. She was forced afterward
to leave her husband because of his treat
ment of her. and since then became recon
ciled with her father. One child is the re
sult of that unhappy un onâ a boy 10 years
old, who stays v.un his grandparent.
Many California audiences have been
charmed with the acting of the woman
who bore the name of Maude Miller. She
has toured the State a number of time?

FOR A BIG DAMAGE SUIT
The Camerons Want the Oakland
Transit Company to Pay
Them S2O,OOO.
OAKLAND, Dec. 24.â The injuries al
leged to have been caused through the
careless handling of a street car are the
basis for a suit for $20,000 damages begun
to-day by H.. M. Cameron and his wife,
Abbie H. Cameron, against the Oakland
Transit Company. The plaintiffs allege
that on January S last they wero driving
across the Eighth street brige in a buggy,
when their, horse took fright at a car
that was rapidly approaching and backed
across the tracks in front of it. A collis
ion followed and Mr. and Mrs. Cameron
were thrown out upon the bridge. Mrs.
Cameron sustained a broken knee cap
and collar bone and was otherwise- severe
ly bruised. The collision is blamed on the
motorman for running his car too fast.

to the cook in the kitchen above. The

other things, two eggs, fried medium! The
waiter, following his custom, went to the
open shaft and then called out my order,
ending with 'for Mistah Gates.' He them
turned to attend to some other duty, but
had not t^ktn more than three steps when
a peculiar look spread over his face. The
next moment he had fairly jumped to the
opening and cried out: 'Say, thar. Wil

RUSSIA TIGHTENING HER .
GRIP UPON MANCHURIA
Czar's Troops Guard All City Gates
and Numerous Colonies Are
Being Founded.
TACOMA, Dec. 21.â The steamship
Braemer brings, news from Yokohama
that Russia has begun to enforce
stringent police regulations through
out the portion of Manchuria that
has been penetrated by the East
Asian Railroad. All gates of de
partmental and district cities aro now
held by Russian troops. Along the route
of me railway, at every distance of five
li. is planted a small Russian village or
colony. Every ten 11 a large Russian vil
lage has been founded, thus holding the
most populous and fruitful regions of the
province in a grip of iron.
Agents for the Russian Government are
traveling over all parts of the three prov
inces "comprising Manchuria, taking a
census of tho population and the number
of cattle and horses possessed by the in
habitants. These agents also visit all
the yamens. large and small. They are
accompanied by interpreters and writers,
who inquire and set down in writing the
local laws and institutions of each city
or town. The inhabitants are being cru
elly treated, with the apparent* object of
drlvinar them out of the country to make
way for Russian colonists.
Official Changes of Names,
The attempt of the Navy Department to
change the name of the League Island
Navy Yard to that of the Philadelphia
Navy Yard was a signal failure, and the
Secretary was obliged to recall the order
authorizing it. Now the department has
attacked the title of the establishment at
the far northwestern corner of the coun
try and has decreed that what has hith
erto been known as the* "Naval Station,
Puget Sound." shall hereafter be desig
nated, the "Navy Yard, Pugret Sound."
There will probably be no protest against
this change, but there does not appear to
be any good reason for not styling It the
Bremerton Navy Yard. The country
would soon discover the location of Bre
merton, even If it is now generally ig
norant of it.â Philadelphia Telegraph.
FIRE WIPES OUT
FRAME BUILDINGS
Big Section of Oakland
Is Threatened With
Destruction.
Lack of Water Gives Flames
Good Start, but Material
, Soon Burns Out.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Dec. 24.
A fire which started in David Barry's
paint shop, 310 San Pablo avenue, thl3
afternoon, destroyed about half a block
of two-story frame buildings owned by
George W. McNear Jr.. and fronting: on
San Pablo avenue and Seventeenth street.
The fire burned fiercely while It lastea
and attracted thousands of Christmas
sheppers. There was no wind, however,
and the material of the structures, al
though highly combustible, was compara
tively unsubstantial and the fire rapidly
burned itself out.
By the time the fire department arrived
the flames had full possession from tha
alley, which separates the paint shop
from the Juanita Hotel, to Seventeent'a
street.
The entire row of buildings facing on
San Pablo avenue was one sheet of. flams
and the interior was transformed into a
roaring furnace. Clouds of heavy black
smoke poured from doors and windows,
and for a while there was foundation for
a fear that a large section of the city was
doomed.
The first streams turned on the flames
were weak, the force not being sufficient
to send the water roof high. In the
course of half an hour or so the pressure*
was increased, and before the fire had
been entirely extinguished the water sup
ply was everything that could be desired.
For awhile the Juanita Hotel, a huge,
barn-like frame structure, was in consid
erable, danger. There was an alley about
fifty feet wide between the hotel and tha
fire, and such wind as there was carried
the flames in the opposite direction.
Barry's paint shop was destroyed, the
flames burning a number of valuable*
buggies.
The headquarters of the Oakland Cream
Depot were gutted and the bicycle stoclc
of Bert Lund almost destroyed.
The second story of the building was
occupied as a lodging-house by a Mrs.
Chittenden. Most of her furniture was
destroyed. What was saved from tha
flames was either spoiled by water op
broken In the process of rescue.
About the only part of the structure!
not utterly destroyed was the section oc
cupied by J. P. Betancue and family.
They managed to save their trunks and,
most of their personal belongings.
It is said that there was no Insurance
on- the property, Mr. McNear preferring
to carry the risk himself.

BOY SNATCHES
WOMAN'S PURSE
Milton McGIllivray, Only
9 Years Old, Guilty
of Crime.
Mrs. Seare, His Victim, Re
fusss to Make Charge
Against Child.
A nine-year-old boy named Milton Mc-
Gillivray, who gave his residence as 1511
Devisadero street, was arrested last night
on Linden avenue and charged at the City
Prison with "purse â¢ snatching." Mrs.
Sears of 604 Buchanan street is the com
plaining witness and Harry Chappelle,
who resides in the neighborhood, was the
one who effected the boy's arrest.
According to Mrs. Sears' statement to
the police she was passing the Simpson
Memorial Church, when four boys grab
bed her and the lad under arrest pulled
the purse out of her hand. McGillivray
ran away. Mrs. Sears screamed and
Chappelle, who was passing, gave chase.
McGillivray ran around to Buchanan
street and then down Linden avenue,
throwing the purse, which contained
about $15, away in his flight. The purse
with its contents intact was later recov
ered.
Mrs. Sears accompanied the boy and
his captor to the City Prison. She related
her story, but would not make a com
plaint. The lad said that he had been
Induced to snatch the purse by his com
panions. He will be held by the police
until they are caught. A search of the '
neighborhood was made for . the three |
boys last night without avail.
In that vicinity complaints have been
frequent of the conduct of the gang of
boys that make the corner of Grove and |
Buchanan streets their headquarters. The j
police have several times endeavored to \
catch them, but their means of escape are
so many and varied that they have in
most cases successfully evaded capture.
ENGINE CRASHES
INTO A WAGON
Fatal Accident on the
Narrow Gauge Near
Grass Valley.
Little Son of Railway Super
intendent Loughridge
Among the Injured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 24.â A probably
fatal accident occurred on the narrow
gauge railroad between Grass Valley and
Nevada City this afternoon. A wild en
gine ran into a wagon at a street cross
ing, and as a result a little son of Super
intendent Loughridge is lying in a pre
carious condition with a fractured skull,
while several other persons are nursing
injuries of a more or less serious charac
ter. The disaster was caused by a too
daring driver, who foolishly urged his
horses across the track In front of -a
swiftly approaching locomotive.
Railroad Superintendent Loughridge
and his little son, In company with Eu
gene Clark and James Drennan, were
riding on the cowcatcher of the engine.
When the point was reached where the
county road crosses the track at Gold
Flat, the locomotive ran Into a brewery
wagon, throwing the men and boy off the
engine. " â¢
Little Kidder Loughridge was the most
seriously injured. He is said to have
been hurled a distance of thirty feet over
a fence, and in falling he struck on his
head. Clark was not badly injured.
James Drennan received a bad cut over
the eye. Superintendent Loughridge was
severely bruised.
The man who was driving the wagon
was employed by the Hieronimous Brew
ery in Nevada City. He was considerably
bruised.
WERI" OFFERED TITLES
BUT REFUSED THEM
Men Who Elected to Leave the Be
stowal of Their Honors
to Posterity.
Not all Englishmen are seeking titles of
nobility. At least there have been many
subjects of the crown who might have
worn coronets, but declined to accept
them for varying reasons that were at
least sufficient to themselves, says the
Chicago Chronicle. The late William
EwartSGladstone was a notable example
of the latter order of humanity, for the
peerage which time after time was held
out to him was always rigidly rejected;"
Swinburne might have had a "Sir" be
fore his name had he chosen to accept the
baronetcy which was offered him some
years ago, but with true democratic in
dependence he refused to accept a title
which; after all, could do little to en
hance his fame.
Similarly Mr. Watts, R. A., whose pic
tures are known the wide world over,
could have ranked with Lord" Leigh ton
had not he stoutly asserted his objection
to titles and elected to remain as he was.
Lord Tennyson, when | first approached
on the question of accepting a peerage,
was strongly . opposed to the idea, but
eventually succumbed to the offer on the
ground that his son would inherit the
title and that he was therefore justified
in taking it.
It is rumored that the late Professor
Huxley was offered a knighthood by Mr.
Gladstoneâ an offer which , was politely
but firmly declined. A similar honor was
proposed to his distinguished contem
porary. Professor Tyndall, and was also
declined without hesitation.
It is an open secret that Charles Dick
ens might have added the word "Bart"
to his illustrious name had he chosen to
do so. . -
A few years before the demise of Verdi
the illustrious composer, the late King
Humbert sent for the maestro and of
fered him a dukedom in recognition of
his services to music. Verdi refused the
gracious offer with dignified courtesy,
whereupon the King /admitted that he
was quite right.
"For," said his Majesty, "all the 1 titles
in Italy could not make you greater than
you are."
Fireflies for Illumination.
The Cuban firefly has been declared by
two American professors to be the cheap
est form cf illumination yet discovered.
The deduction from their Investigations
would seem to be that all present meth
ods of house illumination . may In time
give way to that of utilizing the phos
phorescence of insects. French scientists
have already been at work along the
same line, and it has been- proved possi
ble to read by firefly light.
The contention of Professors S. P
Langley and F. W. Very is that it is pos
sible to produce light without heat other
than that in the light itself. They say
that this Is already accomplished by na
ture's processes, and that these are
cheaper in economy of energy and conse
quently of cost than our Industrial ones
in a degree hitherto unrealized. They ex
plain how the waste in illuminating power
in present methods of lighting is very
excessive, exceeding in some cases -99
parts in the 100, so that for trie energy
expended at least one hundred times more
light should in theory be obtainable than
wo actually get by the usual methods of
illumination. : ' :^-^:\* â '
In their experiments with phosphores
cence thÂ« wrofessors used the Cuban fire
fly. Pyrophoras noctilucus. which has a
length of ahotit an inch and a half, with
a width of half an inch, and is provided
with three light reservoirsâ two in the
thorax and one in the abdomen.
BURGLARS BUSY
IN THE MISSION
Housebreakers Are Ply
ing Their Trade With
" Much Success.
Miss Riley. Believes Thieves
Chloroformed Her Before
Looting Gems. _>
The residents of the Mission are con
siderably alarmed over a series of bur
glaries committed during the past two
weeks. In nearly every case the house
breakers secured valuable booty, consist
ing principally of jewelry. Saturday night
the residence of J. A. Riley; at 2733 How
ard street, was entered while the family
was asleep and a lot of jewelry, $150 in
coin and a lady's cloak were stolen. An
entrance was effected by prying open a
rear window with a "jimmy." Miss Kiley,
who lost heavily by the burglary, believes
that the burglar chloroformed her before
ransacking the house. !
-"I am an unusually light sleeper," re
marked Miss Kiley last-night when telling
of the burglary, "and the fact that I was
not awakened leads me to believe that the
housebreakers chloroformed me before
they proceeeded to gather what valuables
they could lay their hands on. . When I
was awakened in the morning by one of
my relatives and informed of the visit of
the burglars I felt a dizziness in my head,
and at ance concluded that some powerful
drug had been administered 'tcf me while I
slept. Not a room in the house was over
looked by the burglars. They even en
tered the kitchen and, strange to say,
stole a roll of butter which had been left
on the table. My brother's shoes were
also taken from under his bed. After ap
propriating .my jewel-case they took it
down- stairs and forced it open. For some
reason they did not take a valuable gold
buckle which was in the box. Altogether
they secured three gold and -two silver
watches, a lady's cloak, $150 in money and
some other articles of value." .
Miss Riley is satisfied that the burglars
who robbed her home are the same men
who entered the residence of J. Dowd, at
2713 Howard street, a short time ago and
got away with a lot' of jewelry and cloth
ing. â 
Captain Seymour and his men are dili
gently striving to capture the bold house
breakers, but thus far their efforts have
been unsuccessful. â¢ -.----â¢
During the past two weeks â¢ at least a
half-dozen houses in the vicinity of the
home of Miss Riley have been broken
into and valuable property stolen. From
the clever way the burglars work the po
lice are satisfied that they are expert
housebreakers.
POLITICS AND RELIGION
IN NORTH CAROLINA
Colored Brother Expelled Appeals to
the Courts for Rein
statement.
A strange case has been brought before
the Supreme Court of North Carolina by
a colored citizen of that State, who seeks
to be reinstated as a member of a church
which â  had expelled him for voting- the
Democratic ticket. The plaintiff pleads
that the offense charged was not of a suf
ficiently heinous character to justify such,
a serious, form of disciplining. He asks
that his standing in the church be re
stored and that a precedent be thus es
tablished which 'would clearly define the
political rights of a church member.
No doubt the petitioner makes a strong
case, though of course from this distant
point of view we can scarcely estimate
the enormity of the offense as charged.
It" may be possible that from the stand
point of the North Carolina colored breth
ren voting a Democratic ticket is thÂ©
eighth deadly sin. If so, it is difficult to
understand- why Â»- this expelled . sinner
wants to get back into, such a hostile
camp. They can never feel the -true broth
erly love for a black sheep whom the law
forces back into their select fold.
In short, if this North Carolina plaintiff
is looking for trouble of the liveliest and
most persistent sort he will find it ready
for immediate -harvesting if the Supreme
Court grants his petition.

The Monterey Cypress came out the

* . â¢ *!
Yes, The Cypress is dead.
It made a brave struggle for existence,
but finally had to succumb, and this is the
last issue. (Sobs from .office cat.)
J. Faunt LeRoy, who for the past five
months has been furnishing the necessary
gray matter " for its " columns, got dis
heartened or a job last week, threw up
his lease on the plant and left suddenly
for the city without providing a successor.
The undersigned, who, with wife and
baby, was dreaming . away a delightful
vacation amid historic scenes, fragrant
flowers and bright sunshine here by the
sea, and escaping the rigors of a Penn
sylvania winter, was enlisted to take
charge of the paper until other arrange
ments could be made. â 
No one was found brave enough to
tackle the job of infusing new life in The
Cypress,' after its experience' under the
management of the parties to whom it
was leased, so it was decided to discon
tinue its publication after this issue and
remove the plant hence. (More sobs
from o. c.)
Twelve years ago the paper was started
with fairly bright prospects; and under
Messrs. Michaelis and Mr. Brown's man
agement â¢ proved a success. During the
past â  ten months, however, frequent
changes in editors have taken place, and
finally the paper reached a point where it
could not pay expenses. â¢
Despite the fact that one of the hardest
business enterprises to kill , is a country
weekly newspaper, in this case a new
pilot ready to risk himself on Monterey's
uncertain journalistic sea could not be
found, and The Cypress is allowed to join
the ranks of so many more of Monterey's
past enterprises that have flourished for
a time only to wither and fade away,
leaving behind the memory of hopes, def
ferred and ambitions and alms unrealized
(Sobs.) , .
To the friends and patrons who have
stood by the paper through every emer

Ancient Egyptian Campaign.
That Egypt and France held intercourse
as early as 4000 B. C. is proved by the
marked resemblance of Inscriptions found
in the two countries. The excavations of
Professor Flinders Petrie have brought to
light evidence of an^extremely ancient
movement between the land of the Pha
raohs and the. countries bordering on the
Mediterranean.. .; . \. ' . \ â 
This communication, like all other great
invasions of history, had its origin in an
effort at trade extension. The great wars
of the eighteenth. Egyptian dynasty were
provoked by .surrounding nations jealous
of Egypt's growing wealth and power. In
retaliation Egypt carried the campaign
Into. Asia and Europe, and, judging from
the inscriptions mentioned, must have
pushed as far west as France.
Professor Petrie has in his possession a
series of figures found in Malta and
neolithic remains from Brassennuoy in
France which are beyond chance of doubt
the work of Egyptians. - They establish
intercourse long before the period which
is generally recognized as the beginning
of the history of the countries of Europe.

CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â ThoWs '-^Wallace,
the only brother of Edna Wallace Hop
per, the actress, and a joint heir with her
to a fortune of over $200,000, to-day relin
quished his claim to the estate for 1500
cash and a promise of $100 a month dur
ing his life. The negotiations were car
ried on secretly at the Auditorium Annex,
and as soon as the agreement was signed
Miss Hopper, with her attorney, returned
to New York," Just twenty-four hours
after they arrived in Chicago.
Thomas Wallace has lived in Chicago
for years and is engaged in the saloon
business. Mrs. Wallace, the mother, after
being, a widow for many years, married
A. L. â Dunsmuir, the marriage taking
place after Edna Wallace was divorced
from De Wolf Hopper. A few weeks
after the marriage Dunsmuir died, leav
ing his wife the entire estate.
Soon after Edna Wallace Hopper an
nounced she would never marry again as
long as her mother was living, and while
she was preparing for a visit with her she
received word of her mother's death. When
the will was probated it was found that
Mrs. Dunsmuir had left the bulk of her
fortune to her daughter ana $50,000 to her
son, to be paid to him when he reacned
the. age of 45 years. Since the death of
his mother Thomas Wallace has fre
quently appealed to his sister for assist
ance.
Peeling that some kind ' of agreement
should be made with her brother Miss
Hopper came to Chicago, accompanied
by her attorney. The party arrived at
the Auditorium Annex last night. Thomas
Wallace met them at the hotel and at the
end of a long conference a stenographer
was called and an agreement dictated by
which he relinquished his interest to his
sister for the consideration named.
KING'S HEAD ON NEW COINS
WILL LOOK TO THE RIGHT
British Mint Designs for New Sover
eign's Coinage Must Be Reverse
of Previous Reign.
King Edward VII must look to the
right. That Is the law of the mint. His
mother of glorious memory looked to the
left, and British gold, coins are alterna
tive in designs. William IV. looked to
the right on the pieces the mint issued in
his reign, George IV. to the left, George
III to the right, and so on back through
many royal reigns.
The mint says also that the monarch's
portrait must be in profile. The rest, so
far as choice in .designs goes, is left lo
the sovereign's taste, with the particular
reservation that he or she may not wear
the Wreath of Victory until the army or
navy wins laurels for the reign. William
IV heads do not show the wreath. Wil
liam's commanders had not the precise
opportunity while he was on the throne,
but both George III and George IV wore
it on their coins, and so did Victoria the
Good until the Jubilee of 1887, when the
designers substituted the veil and the
crown. ' â¢ â¢ . "â¢ !
Whether Edward VII heads may wear
the wreath or not rests at present with
Kitchener. If he brings South Africa to
order before the â¢ mint has prepared new
designs to â  put before the King his
Majesty- shall have a wreath. He shall
wear a crown" at : any ' rate, If he so
chooses, for that, is a point quite at his
Majesty's discretion. And the "tails"
side of his pieces shall be as he decides.
The King may have an opportunity to
make his influence felt in the -interest of
the decimal system. Already the London
dailies are suggesting this. In an edito
rial the Mail says:
"In almost every country of the world,
certainly in every progressive country
outside the British Empire, the decimal
system long since has replaced the
clumsy and elaborate duodecimal of
other days. Several even among our col
onies have anticipated the mother coun
try in the part of monetary reform. Can
ada, for instance, has. had the decimal
system for more than forty years. Eng
land, however, with that curious con
servatism for which she is so famous,
and which led her to set her face against
electric traction, automobiles and the
cheap telephone uptil her competitors had
gained an immense lead, still' lags be
hind.
"The advantages of the decinial system
are obvious; its disadvantages mainly
sentimental. Its adoption would simplify
arithmetic immensely and the keeping of
accounts. Surely the example, of the
whole civilized world must lead us to
feel some doubt as to the wisdom of
clinging obstinately to our duodecimals."
Even Russia, it seems, which almost is
prehistoric in some things, is to have the
decimal system of money in operation
soon. St. Petersburg, Moscow and other
large cities in the Czar's domain are just
beginning with it,..and In .five years the
Minister of Finance intends it 'shall be in
operation throughout the empire.
Any change will come slowly, however,
for the present circulation of Victorian
coinage is tremendous, far beyond- the
possibility of a general "call in." The
pieces will disappear gradually as they
wear out.
Popular Fallacies as to Anesthetics.
The uneducated may be excused for
their errors as to medical facts, and es
pecially as to anesthetics, but one's smiles
are likely to become cynical when writ
ers of fiction make blunders worse than
those of the people for whom they write.
Often, indeed, fiction it really is! We
read, for Instance, of murderers putting
chloroform beneath the doors of the
sleeping room of their victims, of robbers
waving a handkerchief beneath the nose
of people asleep or awake and thus ren
dering them non-resistant In an instant.
Of couse, it iff not a Kipling or a Zola
who thus misses it in "getting up his
facts," or in the accuracy of his "local
color," but it is curious how indifferent
to accuracy writers are who should know
better and who might so easily learn the
truth. The ease with which, in a hun
dred ways, lay writers go wrong as to
medical matters should â¢ sometimes make
them more wary. Any book on surgery
or anesthetics, or any physician, would
in a few minutes save the novelist his
ludicrous blunders. So much nonsense
has also been written â ; or told about -the
betrayal of secrets or the use of bad lan
guage by patients under an anesthetic
that many women are now positively
morbid minded about this, and would pre
fer atrocious suffering and danger rather
than take ether. "Did I act or talk bad
ly?" is often asked by patients upon
awaking, and with a pathetic fright that
tells how the mind has been fixed on this
rather than the operation. We have no
doubt that "operation was is
often explained by the Inhibition of this
hysteric notion.â American Medical Jour
nal.:
Queer Case of Healing.
Under the heading "A True. Story" the
Denver Medical Times tells- the follow
ing: ' â  â¢ â  . ' . ,
"In the city of Denver there lives an
old veteran with a wooden leg. One of
his near neighbors is a female 'Christian
Scientist,' who is de facto a 'healer.' She
had remarked the old man's imperfect
gait, 1 and at once set about on the sly
to effect a cure, a la Mrs. Eddy: ,'No such
thing as a leg; hence, no such thing as a
limp. Avaunt, limp, , thou delusion of
mortal mind!' â  â  - . : â¢
"What was the healer's joyful surprise
a few mornings later when she beheld
our militant friend passing by with
scarcely a sign of a limp. She eagerly
hailed him on his return and said: 'Oh,
my dear Mr. Blank, I have been con
stantly .thinking and praying for your
recovery, and it. appears that my prayers
have been' answered. Now, what do you
think of Christian Science?' -
"The old warrior stared, reddened,
grinned and replied: 'Wai, marm, you
see my old wooden- leg was mighty nigh
worn- out an'; wobbled considerably, but
this new piece, o' timber that I got yes
terday goes a' d^mslte better.' " â¢ â 
It is in favor of the Christian Scientist
that she: gave her professional â  services

MAY INCREASE
WAGES OF ALL
Railroad Managers Talk
of Rates Paid to
Employes.'
Inequality of Eastern and
Western Schedules
Considered.
CHICAGO, Dec. 24.â At a special meet
ing of the General Managers' Association
held here to-day a movement was started
which may' result in a general increase in
the wages of trainmen, englnemen, fire
men and switchmen on all big railroad
systems east of Chicago.
The meeting was called at the request
of the Pennsylvania Company, the cause
being the coal shortage In Chicago and
other cities, shortage of cars and the con
gested condition of traffic in general. The
coal situation, however, was the moving
cause for the meeting and a discussion re
garding it led to a canvass of the entire
situation.
In the opinion of the majority of the
general managers the general congestion
is due in a measure to inefficiency of the
service rendered by i employes, and this
view led to a discussion of the' labor, and
wage situation from a railroad standpoint.
Although no formal resolution was passed
upon the subject it was generally agreed
that' a raise in the wages of employes
would do much toward stimulating them
to better work, which in turn would help
relieve congested conditions as well as to
prevent them.
Attention was called, to the fact that
the wages of operating employes of rail
roads are from 10 to 12 per cent higher,
taking the average as a whole, west ol
Chicago than they are east. The inequal
ity is due to conditions in the 'early days
of railroading when It cost a great deal
more to live in the West than it did -in
the East and when railroading west of
Chicago meant taking big chances. The
general managers of Chicago are of the
opinion that now is the time to make a
concerted action to even up wages all
over the country. An effort will be made,
it Is said, to induce the managements of
the Eastern lines to grant such increases
In wages as will bring them on a parity
with the wages paid in the West. Should
this be brought about several hundred
thousand men will be granted increases
and the pay rolls of the Eastern roads,
taken as a whole, will be Increased sev
eral million dollars.
GENERAL LYTLE'S POEM
I AM DYING, EGYPT, DYING
Was Written in 1858 and Not oa the
Eve of Chickamauga as
Often Published. !
'it has been often published, and Is gen
erally believed, that the famous poem, be
ginning, "I am dying. Egypt, dying," wa3
written by General W. H. Lytle, the night
before he was killed at Chlckamauga in
1863, and was found on his body at his
death. According to the Courier-Journal
this is not true.
At a meeting of the Fllson Club, a his
torical society, in Louisville a short time
ago, Colonel Durrett, the president, stat
ed that he remembered to have read the
poem in the Cincinnati Commercial In
1858. Colonel J. Stoddard Johnston re
membered to have seen it in print before
the battle of Perryville, where General
Lytle was wounded. Captain Pirtle^who
was within arms' length of General Lytle
when he was wounded at Chlckamauga7
had talked with him about the poem and
heard f rcra him an account of the cir
cumstances under which it . was written.
"It was first printed in the Cincinnati
Commercial on July 20, 1S58."
This settle's the story as to the well
known poem's having been written and
found at Chickamauga, but the discussion
brought out another fact which explains
the persistent story. A poem was found
in General Lytle's pocketbook after his
death, which has never been published.
It was entitled. "Company K," and Cap
tain Plrtle read it to the Filson Club re
cently. There is no doubt that this poem
has been confounded with the earlier one.
"The incident," the Courier-Journal re
marks, shows the usefulness of such organ
izations as the Filson Club, where histori
cal papers are subjected to rigid discus
sion, and air the Information obtainable
upon a given point Is brought out, when
necessary to correct erroneous state
ments." â
If the Courier-Journal pleases, we sug
gest that it use its influence now to have
the club determine, finally, and beyond
apepai, -at its next session, who wrote
"All Is quiet along the Potomac," and
when? ;
Beet Sugar in Spain.
Since the loss of her colonies Spain has
made rapid progress in the development
of her home industries, especially in the
production of beet sugar. Consul Hugnea
of Coburg reports that Spain in 1898 im
ported 748,724 pounds of sugar, but that
In 1899 ! she received from abroad only
20,346 "pounds. In 1000 she imported prac
tically nothing in that line, and the prob
ability is that she will soon be an ex
porter. â¢ And this Is reminiscent of the
claim, that the extensive growing of sugar
beets in other countries Is about to glut
the world's sugar markets; 'Mr. Hughe3
adds:- ."The European producing lands
are Germany, Austria, Russia. France
Belgium. Holland, Sweden, Denmark,
Servla, Burgaria, Roumania. Switzerland
Italy. Greece and Spain. Persia Is just
entering the field; Egypt is realizing that
her soil Is adapted to the cultivation of
the beet; the .United States is* pressing
them all, with Argentina and Chile try-
Ing to follow in her footsteps."

FRANCHISE HAS
LONGER TO RUN
Error as to Expiration
of the Geary-Street
Privilege.
Correct Date Is November 6,
1903, Instead of April
13, 1902.
In taking the preliminary steps for the
acquisition of the Geary-street road by
the municipality, the Board of Supervis
ors was detected in serious error yester
day, which may render nugatory for the
time being any possibility of consummat
ing tlie project. The error consists in
figuring that the franchise granted to the
owners of the road expires on April 13,
1902, when in fact it will not expire until
November 6, 1903, or exactly one year,
six months and twenty-three days later
than the date reckoned upon by the
Board of Supervisors.
The history of street railroad franchises,
published by authority of the Board of
Supervisors and containing a digest of
all the ordinances granting rights of way
to various street railroad companies, dis
closes the fact that by ordinance number
1469, passed November 6. 1S78, a franchise
was granted to Charles Main, Reuben
Morton, S. C. Bigelow, James McCord,
William Eppelsheimer, C. F. McDermott
and Thomas R. Hayes, in terms as fol
lows :
The Geary-Street Franchise.
Commencing: at the intersection of the west
erly line of Keamy street with Geary street,
and running thence westerly along Geary streec
to Central avenue; thence along Point I>obos
avenue to First avenue; thence alonÂ»: First
avenue to the park. Franchise twenty-five
years from November ti, .1878. Cars to be
moved by horses dV by wire cables moved by
stationary steam engines. License tax $15 per
annum upon each car used. Rate of fare not
to exceed 5 cents; rate of speed not to exceed
eight miles per hour.
It will be noted that the language of
the ordinance specifically states that the
franchise expires twenty-five years from
November 6, 1&7S, which would make the
date of expiration November 6. 1903.
The mistake of figuring on the expira
tion of the franchise as April 13, 1902,
originated from the fact that a previous
ordinance, numbered 1352. was adopted on
April 13, 1877, granting a franchise to C.
T. Deane, William Eppelsheimer, C. H.
Stanyan, W. W. Morrow, George K. Por
ter and Zenas Crowell to operate street
cars along the same right of way as
granted in the subsequent ordinance, but
â with the two blocks from Keamy to
Stockton eliminated therefrom. The own
ers of the read realized that their fran
chise would be of greater value if the
road should run to Keamy street, so the
assigns, in their second application for
the privilege, included the two blocks
named, which were incorporated in the
later franchise passed November 6, 1878.
which superseded the one granted April
13, 1877. The latter franchise was in fact
nullified by the adoption of the ordinance
granting the amended franchise.
City Attorney Asked for Opinion.
After all these years the City Attorney
has been called upon to determine
the power to grant the amended fran
chise in 1S7S, since it was for practically
the same route as that granted by the
franchise of 1S77 with only the addition
of the two blocks between Keamy and
Stockton. Should the City Attorney de
cide that the second franchise covers only
the two blocks named and the first fran
chise the rest of the route, the munici
pality would ftill have to wait more than
a year and a half to use the roadway be
tween Keamy and Stockton streets.
HIS FEIXOW-DIRECTORS

the Hisdon Iron Works, Recipi
ent of Rich Gift.
. Captain W. H. Taylor, president of the
Risdon Iron Works, was the recipient of
a magnificent Dur.fee clock at the hands
of the directors yesterday. Captain Tay
lor's popularity as man and official of one
of the largest iron works on the Pac'fic
Coast is as marked among the directors
as It is among the employes, and the gifc
was a Christmas expression of the appre
ciation in which he is held by his asso
ciates. The presentation speech was made
by Frank G. Drum, and when Captain
Taylor responded he was warmly applaud
ed. The presentation was a complete sur
prise to the recipient, and proved to be a
happy incident for all concerned.
Friendly Suit Filed.
The suit filed by Henry Eggeling,
guardian of Henry Nieman Jr., against
Mrs. Louisa Franz, formerly Mrs. Louisa
Nieman, notice of which was published
In The Call a few days ago, is of a friend
ly nature and is brought to establish prop

tablish the young man's claim.

OF SANTA CLAUS AT THE TRUMBO HOME
Aged Clubman Distributes -â¢Gifts at a Christmas Eve Party
Given in Accordance With the Custom of the Genial
Colonel â Some Delightful Events of the Closing Year
UNCLE GEORGE BROMLEY was
in his element at the Christmas
party given last evening by Col
onel and Mrs. Isaac Trumbo at
their residence, 1533 Sutter street.
He was Santa Claus and he filled the
part to perfection. Uncle George had no
mustache to deceive the little ones or
their parents. He handed out gifts with
such a "glad hand" that the recipients
were unable to refuse them. The aged
clubman had a merry word for all. The
winsome miss, the small boy who has be
come dubious about the man who comes
down the ! chimney and the older folks
who recall their own days of blissful ig
norance accepted from him presents of
all kinds.
He was the accepted representative of
Colonel Trumbo and his beautiful wife.
They had devoted the past week choosing
presents for their friends that would be
appreciated. ' "
. In â¢ giving his delightful party Colonel
Trumbo simply followed a custom he in
augurated many years ago. His home
has always been thrown' open on Christ
mas eve. Last night from 9 o'clock until
midnight the guests dropped in to par
take of his hospitality. Among the friends
who called were artists of ability, who
I rendered sweet songs and musical selec
tions.
At 9 'o'clock 'the carol ' singers of St.
Luke's Church stood outside the bril
liantly lighted windows and sang "Noel."
At the conclusion of the song the chor
isters were invited in and made glad with
presents and refreshments. The Knick
erbocker quartet and the Bohemian trio
also rendered selections. Ossie Franks,
the well known tenor, scored his usual
success with his pleasing melodies. Louis
Butler recited, as did also Airs. Nellie
Â±ioibrook-iSllnn.
Mistletoe hung from every chandelier,
and it proved dangerous lor belles to
stand beneath the bough.
une magnmcent collection of paintings
owned by the Trumbos were hung and
the guests enjoyed viewing them. There
were canvases from the brush of Millet,
Jules ijupree, Messinier, Bonheur and
others, 'ihey represent scenes of every
description;
Mrs. Trumbo proved a delightful host
ess. She made every one feel at home
and entertained the guests. She was at
â¢ tired in a magnificent gown of pink.

A banquet was given last night at the

Christmas. The guests left the festive
board at a late hour, voting Mr. Gaston
a royal host.

CLARENCE KING
DIES IN TUCSON
Famous Geologist and
Mining Expert Passes
Away.
Man Who Expo* d he Utah
Diamond Minu Fraud
Galled to Rest
News was received in the city yester
day that Clarence King, the welljknown
geologist and mining expert, died last
Saturday at Phoenix, Ariz., from gallop
ing consumption. .
The deceased was credited with being
the greatest geologist on this coast, and
his services after his retirement from the
employment of the Government were
greatly in demand. His most sensational
report was handed to W. C. Ralston many
years ago, when he informed him that a
diamond mine, which was supposed . to
have been located in Southern Utah, was
a fraud, and "that if diamonds hau been
found in that locality the claims had cer
tainly been "salted."
The Utah "diamond mine" incident oc
curred in the early seventies. A man by
the name of Harpending arrived in this
city from the East. He was a total
stranger and attempted to induce a num
ber of San Francisco capitalists to form
a company aud buy a diamond mine lo
cated in Southern Utah. The man exhib
ited some fine stones to show as samples
and the mine was deemed worthy of being
examined. - A mining expert was dis
patched to the scene, and upon his recom
mendation the deal was nearly consum
mated.
Clarence King, who happened to be in
the city at the time, denounced the fraud
and said that with his knowledge of geol
ogy he was certain that diamonds did not
exist in that locality. He quietly visited
the supposed diamond mine and found
that his convictions were right. He came
back to San Francisco and exposed the
whole plot.
- Clarence King had great literary abil
ity and contributed many articles on
scientific subjects to Eastern magazines.
He also wrote a book .entitled "Moun
taineering in the High Sierras," which
became very popular.
The last few years Clarence King has
made his. residence in New York, but he
often came to California on mining busi
ness. In New York and this city he was
very popular in club circles and his loss
will be deeply mourned by a large num
ber of friends.
EASTERN COUPLE COME
TO COAST TO MARRY
W. G. Blatt of Detroit and Mrs. Grace
Wilson of Denver Quietly
"Wedded.
A quiet marriage was solemnized at the
residence of Rev. Dr. John Hemphill, at
2020 Broadway, yesterday. The contract
ing couple were William G. Blatt, West
ern manager of Pingree & Smith, the
well-known shoe firm of Detroit, Mich.,
of which the late Governor .of Michigan
was senior member, and Mrs. Grace Wil
son, a wealthy widow of Denver.
The groom is well known to the business
community of San Francisco. He is con
nected with several large enterprises,
chief among which is the Robert Mitchell
Machine Company of Detroit, of which he
is vice president. He arrived in this city
about two weeks ago, but his most Inti
mate friends were not aware that his trip
to the coast was made especially to meet
his fiancee, Mrs. Wilson, who was plan
ning a bridal tour to Honolulu. Mrs. Wil
son arrived here the day after Blatt, and
preparations for the marriage were com
pleted. The wedding was private, and
after the ceremony the happy couple re
ceived the congratulations of their friends
in their parlors at the Palace.
The bride is a handsome young woman,
accomplished and quite wealthy. She has
for several years pa^st fcesn a belle in Den
ver's best set. The groom is a young man
of excellent family, a widower and the
possessor of a competency. The couple
will leave for Del Monte to-morrow, and
after a few days at that resort they will
visit their homes in the Kast. The Hono
lulu trip has been temporarily abandoned.
JUSTICE DANIELS SHARPLY
REBUKES TWO ATTORNEYS
Suit of Robert M. Waddell Against
James (lately Causes Acrimonious
Remarks by Opposing Counsel.
Justice of the Peace Daniels adminis
tered a sharp rebuke yesterday to At
torneys H. W. Hutton and J. F. Coffey
in the suit of Robert M. Waddell against
James Gately and the Risdon Iron
Works. Waddell is suing the defendants
for $249 35, the value, of a trunk and per
sonal belongings alleged to have been re
tained by Gately.
Waddell was brought from the East by
the Risdon company to work as a ma
chinist but deserted his position after one
day's work. Waddell had been a boarder
at the Gately lodging house and was re
ferred to Superintendent. E. M. Bassett
of the iron works when he demanded the
return of his trunk. Waddell testified
that Gately told him he could have his
trunk back when he reimbursed the com
pany for the expenses incurred in bring
ing him to this city, as he had broken his
contract.
The attorneys In the case thereupon
became very acrimonious and Indulged in
so many insulting remarks toward each*
other that Judge Daniels told them he
would commit them for. contempt If they
did not cease, as they were not showing
proper respect to the court. The attor
neys became subdued after that and the
case went over until to-iiiorrow.
SAYS HE WAS SWINDLED

complaint in Judge Mogan's court yester
day charging Louis Estacaille, butcher.

Aronsohn were induced by Estacaille to
purchase a lot of different oil stocks
about July 10 last, and in payment they
conveyed to him a lot of land In this city

It is now alleged that' the oil stock
proved to be utterly worthless and that
Estacaille was aware of that fact when
the sale was made. Estacaille refuses to
reconvey the lot to the Aronsohns, hence
the warrant for his arrest. .

LABOR FACTIONS
HOLD MEETINGS
Parry and Delaney Parti
sans Are Consider
ing Plans.
Both factions of the Union Labor party
held meetings last night. The Parry fac
tion met in the hall of the Theatrical
Mechanics' Association, from which they
departed in such haste on the occasion of
their last meeting. The Delaney faction
met at the headquarters of the Cooks'
and Waiters' Alliance. They had In addi
tion to the even dozen who appeared to
form the committee T. Carl Spelling as an
adviser on the subject of public utilities.
The Parry faction held two meetings.
One was behind closed doors and was tne
regular meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Union Labor party. Chairman
Parry presided and Secretary Aubertin
was at the desk. The meeting lasted but
a few minutes, and at the close it was an
nounced that routine matters only were
discussed and that these mainly related
to the formation of a State organization.
Immediately afterward a temporary or
ganization of a committee to form the
nucleus of a body to â  be known as the
Central League Club was effected by tha
same parties. S. D. Simmons was elected
temporary chairman and James Mullaly
temporary secretary. J. S. Parry and
other members stated that there seemed
to be a general desire among the various
unions throughout the State to unite in a.
labor movement, and that clubs would bs
formed as soon as the local committees
had decided upon a plan of action.
A number of suggestions were made as
to what form the central body should
take, what representation should be al
lowed and other pertinent matters. It
was finally decided to refer the entire sub
ject matter to a committee of five to pre
pare a plan of organization. The chair
named as the members J. S. Parry, A. H
Ewell, J. H. Roxburgh, George Krimp
kofT and G. W. Aubertin. After deciding
to attend the meeting of the Oakland
branches that desire to affiliate with the
Union Labor party on Sunday night, at
Butchers' Union headquarters, the com
mittee adjourned to the call of the chair.
At the meeting of the Delaney faction
the minutes of the meetings of December
10 and 17 were read. These were the
minutes which were temporarily put in
escrow the night of the ruction between
the factions, when Mayor-elect Schmitz
was hastily summoned to act as peace
maker. A suit is now pending for their
recovery. How the Delaney faction se
cured them and how or why the Parry
faction gave them up or lost them was
not disclosed.
A communication from the Iroquols
Club requesting a conference with seven
members of the committee to confer on
the subject of public utilities was read
After T. Carl Spelling addressed the
meeting the following were named as the
committee: Lane, Hutchlnson. Ryan Cas
sldy, Stewart. Power and McKeon
Delegate Ryan reporte'd that he had met
Mayor-elect Schmitz and had Invited him
to be present.
"But the Mayor said the trouble was
bad enough," added Ryan, "and he did
not want to mix up any more in the af-
Next came the consideration of a Stat*
organization. All kinds of plans were sue"
gested. but the one that met with the
most favor was the drafting of an ad
dress to each labor union in the State
urging the formation of clubs. Each t>re
cinct where a club might be formed wan
to be entitled to one delegate. SS 1 th?n
the whole number of delegates to be
merged in one central organization No
definite action was taken, but the matter
will be considered next Tuesday night
At the same time T. Carl- Spelling wili
also speak on public utilities
