sion of a desire to assist the United States
Government by all practical means in
Russia Ready to Assist.
"ELLEN M. STONE."
"With hearty salutations, your friend,
"We are pursued by a Turkish army. I
beg Dr. Haskell himself to go to Con
stantinople and exert himself for the pay
ment of the ransom at Sammakoff, where
men will receive it on presenting an order
from me.
"The men who captured us at first
Ehowed courtesy and consideration toward
us, but now since Turkish soldiers and
Bash! Bazouks have begun to pursue us
and the ransom. is delayed our condition
1b altogether changed.
"Therefore, I beg you to hasten sending
the ransom demanded and that as ener
getically as possible you will present to
the Turkish Government that It stop the
pursuit of us by soldiers and Bashi Ba
zouks; otherwise we shall be killed by
the people in whose hands we are". I pray
you to communicate without delay the
contents of this letter to the representa
tive of the United States at the Porte
and request his most serious co-operation.

Further word has come from Miss Stone
in the following letter, written from
Macedonia, to W. "W. Peet, treasurer of
the Turkish Mission In Constantinople:
"My Honored Friendâ I write to inform
you that on September 3 I was captured
by a great number of armed men â some
fortyâ as I traveled from Bansko to
Diamaala with about twelve teachers,
students and others. They took with me
for lay companion Mrs. Catherine Tsilka.
The reason why they captured us is for a
ransom. The price which they demand
for is Â£25,000. Turkish, which sum must
be paid In gold, and this entirely without
the knowledge of the Turkish and Bul
garians governments, within the term of
eightc-en days from to-day.
"The condition of Mrs. Tsilka decided
the limit, as she is to give birth to a
child in three months.
SOFIA. Bulgaria. Oct. 15.â Although the
time fixed by the brigands who abducted
Hiss Ellen M. Stone, the American mis
sionary, forthe jjayment of the ransom
demanded expired a week ago, no one has
appeared at Sammakoff to claim the
money or to announce the fate of thÂ«
captive. It is now learned that the band
has dissolved, but that "Miss Stone Is kept
Tinder surveillance at some distance from
the frontier. This is due to snow and cold
\u25a0weather rendering the mountains unin
habitable. The efforts of the police to ar
rest Saraokoff. formerly president of the
Macedonian committee, who is suspected
cf complicity in the kidnaping, are still
unavailing. The failure is due to the
syrcpa-thy of the Inhabitants and local
authorities.
The parents of Madame Tsilka, tho Bul
garian teacher, who was captured by
brigands with Miss Stone, have received
another letter from their daughter urging
the step already taken, namely stop
pins the military pursuit, because the
brigands threaten the prisoners with im
mediate death in the event of danger to
themselves. The writer says that she and
Miss Stone are hidden In a subterranean
retreat and are treated courteously. She
says the only means of securing their re
lease is to pay the ransom demanded.

NEW YORK, Oct. 15.-Up to 6 o'clock
this evening Roland B. Molineux, in Sing
Sing Prison, had not been informed that
he had been granted a new trial. General
Mollneux reached Sing Sing early In the
evening, but it was then too late for him
to go to the prison, as the doors close for
the night at 5:30 o'clock. Warden John
son adhered to his decision not to disclose
the news to the prisoner until officially
notified from Albany.
The warden was asked if he would al
low General Molineux or his wife or Mrs.
R. )3. Molineux to inform the prisoner of
the change in. the aspect of his case. To
this the warden replied that if the mem
bers of his family or any one of them
sought an Interview with the young man,
and they, were entitled to It, and if they
wished to tell him it would be their privi
lege. The elder Mrs. Molineux did not
call at the prison during the day, as had
been anticipated.
Molineux Not Informed.
The other three Judges, Parker (Chief
Justice). Gray and Haight. hold that the
evidence is admissible in that the evi
dence in the Earnett case pointing toward
Molineux tends to identify him as the
person who killed Mrs. Adams while at
tempting to take the life of Cornish by
means of that rare poison known as cya

The only subject about which the mem

death of Barnett by the same method as
that used in taking the life of Mrs.
Difference of Opinion.
"All writings proved to the satisfaction
of the court by a preponderance of evi
dence In civil cases, and beyond a reason
able doubt in criminal cases, (1) by wit
nesses who saw the paper written or to
whom it had been acknowledged; (2) by
witnesses familiar with the handwriting
of the person charged to be the writer
and who are able to testify from their
familiarity to a belief respecting Its gen
uineness^ (3) where the writing is shown
to have been recognized and acquiesced in
by the person supposed to have written it,
or adopted and acted upon by him In his
business transactions or concerns, may
under the statute be compared with the
disputed writing by "witnesses. But the
court should refuse to receive in evidence
solely for the purpose of comparison any
writing otherwise prejudicial to the de
fendant."
Admission of Writings.
"All agree that since the amendment of
section 2 of chapter 36 of the laws of 1880,
by chapter 55 of the laws of 1Â£S8, genuine
writings may be received In evidence as
standards of comparison with a disputed
writing, although such writings may not
be the issue of trial, but simply a fact
relevant and material to that issue; that
the genuineness of such. writings must be
established to the satisfaction of the court
by common law evidence, and when that
is done handwriting experts may compare
the disputed \u25a0writings \u25a0with the genuine
writings and give their opinion thereon,
but they cannot select and establish the
standards of comparison and then com
pare them â¢with the disputed writings.
"Every member of the Court of Appeals
agrees for the reversal of tho judgment
of conviction of Molineux on the ground
that the trial court erred In receiving in
evidence the declarations of Barnett made
to Doctors Phillips and Douglass that he
had received Kutnow powders through the
mall.

City and sentenced to death. The court
grants a new trial on a prevailing opin

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BROOKLYN WHO WILL GIVE IMPOR
TANT TESTIMONY BEFORE THE NAVAL. COURT OF INQUIRY TO-DAY
CONCERNING COMMODORE SCHLEY'S CAMPAIGN.* . . > .,. ;"The belief is growing here," says a dis
patch to the Standard from Constanti
nople, "that the Bulgarian and not the
Turkish Government Is responsible for the
retention of Miss Stone, whose capture
was committed with the connivance of
Macedonian agitators, if not with that of
the higher authorities. The attitude of
the latter toward brigand bands Is most
suspicious and very different from what
it was during the time of Stambuloff."
The Daily News, in an editorial upon the
case of Miss Stone, while sympathizing
with the efforts in, her behalf, expressed
the opinion that the payment of a large
ransom is a very questionable proceeding.
"Turkey could easily stamp out brigand
age," says the Daily News, \u25a0'"but so 'long
as benevolent foreigners will pay high
ransoms, why should the Turks trouble?"
It suggests that Miss Stone's letter is
"Just such a document as a clever brig
and chief would drop into the American
letter-box at the present moment," and
concludes by remarking: "An army of
brigands endowed by American subscrip
tions will not add to. the tranquillity of
Eastern Europe."
"It Is possible that the brigands who
captured Miss Stone have withdrawn Into
the interior, of Macedonia In the direction
of Nevrokap," says a dispatch to the
Daily Telfegrapn- f rom Sofia.
"Former, members of the Macedonia
committed, who were arrested on suspi
cion of complicity, denied before a magis
trate any^knowledge of the affair." :â¢
"Pastors -.Dimikroff and Zirkoff, with

Stone." ,

it. is contemplated to continue the present
Palmer Mount- tunnel, now in nearly a
mile, to the town x of Oro, a distance of
nine and * a half miles. This tunnel will

NOME, Sept. 26 (via Seattle. Oct. 15).â
On Richard Dougherty's claim, at â¢ the
mouth of Turner Creek, there is a buried
forest. Trees 100 feet long have been un
covered. Some are in an excellent state
of preservation, but others are much
decayed. The wood resembles California
redwood, and some of the trees are ex
ceedingly large.
This was once .a tropical or semi-tropi
cal climate beyond doubt, and ages ago
the mammoth roamed through the wood
ed plains and helped himself to the luxu
riant vegetation. Near this buried for
est elephant tusks, deer horns and mam
moth tusks have been found. A clear,
sparkling, soda spring bubbles up in the
same vicinity, and animals travel many
miles to drink its waters, which are
pleasant to the taste and possess excel
lent medical properties.
The trunk of a tree 9 feet in diameter
at the butt, 6 feet in diameter at the top
where it had been broken off and 80 feet
long was found recently on Jones & Em
erson's Claim on Quartz Creek. It was 30
feet beneath the" surface. The tree was m
a fairly good state of preservation.
Samples of the wood were brought lo
Ncme by A. H. Jo&e. The wood resem
bles cedar and is light in weight,, but dark
in . color, probably from having lain so
leng under ground. The bark, which re
sembled fir, was at least 14 Inches thick.
A gentleman ' connected with the United
States geological survey, who was on
Quartz CrecK, examined the tree, but
could not determine to what species it
belonged. . \ .
The jawbone and teeth of some prehis
toric animal were found in the roots of
this prehistoric tree. The jawbone was
larger than that of a horse. It will be

right Battle With Officers and One
of Their Number Is Badly
Wounded.
SEATTLE, Oct. 15. â Five armed men
to-night held up a Ballard (Wash.) sa
loon, rained shots upon the inmates, es
caped through the smoke and a few mo
ments later sandbagged and robbed a pe
destrian on a back street. In all they ob
tained $150 and two gold watches, $40 be
ing from the saloon till, one of the
\u25a0watches and $10 from a man who was in
the place at the time and $100 and a gold
watch from their last victim. At a late
hour they were still at large, with officers
in pursuit.
The Ballard liquor store, of which N.
Theissen is proprietor, was the scene of
the first hold-up. Theissen, John Gold
emith and G. Fisher were in the saloon,
Theicsen and Fisher beinfc behind the
bar. .Through a rear door three men en
tered. One wore a mask and all carried
revolvers. -
Leveling these they ordered the in
mates to hold up their hands. The order
was obeyed. One of the men then ad
vanced toward the front of the room and
the other two remained in the rear, keep
ing their victims covered. . . .
The first robber went behind the bar
and took all the money in the till. He
then ordered Theissen to open the safe.
Theissen said that he was a bartender
and did not know the combination. The
robber then took from Goldsmith a gold
watch and $10 in currency.
At this juncture Mrs. Theissen, wife of
the proprietor, started downstairs from, a
room above to enter the barroom. She
was evidently heard by a picket in front,
for two shots were fired outside.
Immediately the highwayman who had
done the robbing ordered his three vic
tims to march to" the rear of ' the room
Mrs. Theissen could be heard coming
down stairs. All three robbers immedi
ately began firing toward the front of the
ealoon. A moment later T. L. Richards
who with others had been attracted by
the shots, attempted to enter : the front
door. The highwaymen began shooting
again. Mrs. Theissen was then in- the
room. â¢ One of the bullets narrowly missed
her. I>uring this time the highwaymen
were withdrawing slowly. Just as they
were leaving the rear door Marshal Hunt
and Policeman Ballou entered the front
doorr- They -opened fire on the retreating
robbers. The <atter ran through the rear
Coor, -firing as they went. ; j : " j
The five robbers . hastened In a north
easterly direction. â¢ When near the'Pres
pyterian Church they met M. J. -Davis,
Great ! Northern agent. They attacked
him.withoiit-scariiing-and-beat him to the
ground. Hurriedly they rifled his pockets
taking a gold watch and 5100 in gold. They
then disappeared. ...
â¢The saloon is riddled with bullets. In
all fifteen halls have been found in the
walls and floorer, traced by holes through
the front windows, As they left the sa

REDDING, Oct. 15.â The largest mine
sale in Siskiyou County in several years
has Just been consummated. John O.
Welch, a pioneer, who has mined in
Shasta and Siskiyou counties for fifty
years, sells the Great Northern Sweep
stake mine to a Pennsylvania syndicate
for a sum exceeding $600,000. Before leav
ing ?or Siskiyou County to-night Mr.
Welch admitted that the -first payment
had been made to him and the other pay
ments are to follow at stipulated periods.
The Great Northern Sweepstake prop
erty comprises about 5000 acres border
ing French Creek, near Yreka. John
Welch has been acquiring it in sections
by location and small purchase during
the past thirty years. Part of it is quartz
and part placer ground. Welch has de
voted himself to developing it in differ
ent places to demonstrate the approxi
mate value of the whole property and
prepare for a sale. The extraction of the
gold is expensive and far beyond his mod
est means.
The company of Plttsburg capitalists
has had experts on the property three
times and has thoroughly explored tha
property. It is declared to bo one of the
greatest gold mines of Northern Califor
nia. The purchasers will prosecute de
velopment work with as large a force &a
can be worked to advantage. It is the
intention to install a smelter, for handling
the ore from the lower levels. A com
plete hydraulic system will be built upon
the gravel section.
Mr. Welch will remain for a time to di
rect operations before forsaking work to
enjoy his new competence in his old age.

TRENCHES HALT
ADVANCING FIRE
SEATTLE, Oct. 15.â The Nippon Tusen
Kaisha liner Kaga Maru and the Ger
man steamer Elba, the former en route
to the Orient and. the latter vessel in
bound, collided in a dense fog this after
noon at a point about a mile south of
Five Mile Point and a mile and a half
from the Smiths Cove piers. The Elba
struck the Kaga Maru near the forecas
tle, tearing a hole in the Japanese steam
er fully seven feet in diameter. The dam
age was inflicted while both vessels were
steaming at half speed. Because of the
fact that the vessels struck one another
ahead of the collision bulkheads there
\u25a0was no serious danger.
The Kaga Maru remained at the Smiths
Cove piers for, eight hours, waiting for
the fog to evaporate. She was to have
departed yesterday morning, but it was
considered dangerous to .venture out. At
2 o'clock, however, the fog had considera
bly lightened, and Captain Ekstrand or
dered the steamer warped out of the dock.
Upon leaving the pier he rang for half
speed and sent the steamer in a direction
several degrees clear of Five Mile Point.
After proceeding about a mile and a haif
the German steamer Elba suddenly loom
ed up through the fog. She also was un
der half speed. The men on each vessel
had observed the other's approach and
the, signals were given for full speed
astern. They were so close together, how
ever, that a collision was inevitable and
the Elba crashed into the Kaga Maru
just abaft the stern and ahead of the col
lision bulkhead.
. The shock when the two big vessels
came together was sufficient to create
considerable commotion, but as soon as
the Elba had backed away from the Kaga
Maru it was seen that there was no dan
ger. The captain of the Elba offered any
needed assistance to Captain Ekstrand
of the Kaga Maru, but the latter declined
the proffered* help, turned his vessel
around and steamed into port again.
The officers on the Elba say that they
were trying to locate the Smiths Cove
piers at the time of the collision. The
fog was so thick that they could not make
out their bearings and they were not ac
quainted with the immediate vicinity.
It is not known what the damage to the
Kaga Maru will amount to. The hole in
her bow is not a dangerous one, and It is
possible that the local agents will order
only temporary repairs and then start the
liner on her interrupted voyage to the
Orient. A board of examiners will survey
the vessel to-morrow.
The Kaga Maru was laden to her full
capacity with freight and carried as pas
sengers twenty-eight missionaries who
are destined for Chinese inland ports.
There were a number of Japanese in the
steerage. The Elba had neither cargo nor
passengers.

Gentlemen: â Stnart's â¢ Dyspepsia Tablets
were recommended to me for my 2-
months'-old baby, which was sick and
puny, and the doctors said was suffering
from indigestion. I took the child to the
hospital, but there found no relief. A.
friend mentioned the Stuart Tablets and I
procured a box from my druggist and
used only the large sweet lozenges in tho
box, and was delighted to find thej' were
just the thing- for my baby. I feel justi-
fied in saying that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets saved my child's life.

lets in every box. FulJ sized boxes are

parent should neglect the U3e of this safe
remedy for all stomach and bowei trou-

But it is not generally known that the.

Little children 'who are pale, thin and

should use the tablets after eating and
will derive great benefit from them.
Mrs. G. H. Crotsley, 538 "Washington

"Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets just rill the
bill for children as well as for older folks.
I've had the best of luck with them. My

she drops everything: else and runs for

A Buffalo mother, a short time ago,

BERLIN, Oct. 15.â The Murchener Zel
tung prints a dispatch from Hilversum
which says that Mr. Kruger, in spite of
all denials, is severely ill.
The question Is discussed with bated
breath in London and the opinion is ex
pressed that Lord Kitchener and. Lord
Milner should have waited before adopt
ing such strenuous measures until the
precise moment when Botha, Dewet and
Delarey are at the end of their resources
and unable to capture British soldiers
and- retaliate by shooting them In return
for hanging Cape farmers and the execu
tion of Lotter's death sentence."
Discussing General Kitchener's procla
mation and the policy of declaring mar
tial law in Cape Colony, a London corre
spondent says:
"If he succeeds the rebellion will be
stamped out in Cape Colony and the
Boers, repulsed from the Invasion of Na
tal, will be gradually starved out on their
own territory. Much depends on the tem
per and ability of the Boers respecting
reprisals. They will lose the support of
their Cape allies unless they can avail
themselves of the resources of retaliation,
horrible as the alternative may be."
LONDON, Oct. 14.â A rumor was start
ed on the Stock Exchange this morning
that General Botha, the Boer commander
In chief, has been captured. However, a
dispatch from Lord Kitchener, dated at
Pretoria yesterday evening, contains
nothing more Important than the weekJy
summary of the captures, a reiteration of
the statement that General Kitchener's
columns are moving against a consider
able force of Boers near the Natal fron
tier, with which General Botha is sup
posed to be, and the announcement that
Commandant Scheeper's command in
Cape Colony has been broken up.
It is reported that Maud Gonne haa

is now on her way to South Africa. Tho
authorities of the principal ports have
been notified to watch for her arrival.

There Is no serious trouble In China

Numerous and heavy as were the defalca
tions for \u25a0 the year 1900. yet for each bonded
man that strayed from the path of rectitude
there were over 900 that remained faithful. It
Is to be noted that the heavy defalcations last
year were mostly by men not covered by sure
ty bond. Without Intimating that the com
panies do not, as a rule, pay their losses, we
regret to report that, during: the year 1900.
61 per' cent of the losses reported to us -were
resisted, contested or otherwise unpaid by the
companies who had accepted the premiums
and issued therefor something that was called
fidelity Insurance, the losses to our members
from this source being in a single year sev

in 1893 to 4500 in 1900, an increase of 200
per cent in five years. â¢ The report alluded
to .the work of the protective committee
as one of the most important features of
the association, and the committee is
credited with accomplishing decided re
sults in the line of the "ceaseless warfare
which we have declared and carried on
against professional criminals and in se
curing immunity for our members from
these deft and light fingered gentry."
On the subject of uniform laws, the re
port stated that the negotiable instrument
law has been enacted in seventeen States.
The council promises renewed efforts of
the coming session of Congress toward
securing repeal of the tax on capital and
surplus of banks. The report declared
that "the question of a suitable currency
system, adapted to our needs and our
banking system, is one of the living issues
of the day."

the committee on internal revenue taxa
tion, appointed for the purpose of having
a reduction made in existing internal rev
enue laws. The report states that the re
sulting legislation is not all that the com
mittee desired, but the association may
congratulate itself on the results accom
plished.

the committee on bureau of education, the
substance of which was an indorsement
of the correspondence school of the Amer
ican Institute of Bank Clerks. -

on the proposed canon on marriage , and

VOTE ON DIVORCE CANON V; ;
IS TAKEN BY THE H0TJ3E
THE final vote of the House of
Deputies on the much-discussed
canon on marriage and divorce
was taken yesterday afternoon
and resulted in a victory for
\u25a0 those deputies who were op-,
posed to the total prohibition
of marriage of divorced persons.
The canon providing for the disciplining
of divorced persons also went down to de
feat in the committee of the whole of the
House of Deputies.
The result of the votes yesterday on the (
canons on marriage and divorce and on
the disciplining of .divorced persons who
remarry is to leave intact the church
legislation that has been in force for many
years. .
An important measure was also adopted
by the House of Deputies yesterday atter*
noon, when a majority vote accepted the
amendment to the constitution presented
by a committee of which the Kev. Dr.
Huntington was chairman, providing- for
the spiritual oversight by a Bishop of cer
tain congregations not in union with the
Episcopal church. This amendment was
in line with the one previously introduced
by Dr. Huntington, but which was defeat
ed earlier In the convention. The new
amendment clearly defines certain attii
butes which the congregations and their
pastors must possess before an Episcopal
Bishop can give them spiritual oversight.
A flood of amendments, substitutes and. mo
tions .came thick and fast from all parts of
the house and after a tangle it was finally
decided to vote on the sections by Â«rders
The secretary then read the three sections of
the canon defining what marriage is and how
it must be solemnized by the clergy of the
Episcopal churchy the. number of witnesses to
be present and the question of receiving the
consent of parents to a marriage in certain

that a part of its territory be received by the
General Convention as a missionary district.
With the report verbal explanations were made

the- American church, asking, in view of the
fact that the matter had taken a turn which
obviated the need of the intervention of the
deputies, . that the committee be discharged
from further .consideration of the subject. Ths
request was granted. '

bishopric of Honolulu, the principal feature

MESSAGES FEOM BISHOPS.
"Resolved, That the fellows of the seminary
be eent abroad to â¢ pursue their studies rather
than In the seminary Itself."
Dr. Carey explained the last recommendation

eral Seminary.

that scholarships be awarded by competitive
examination and

TOLD IN FIGURES
7 HE rejection by the House of Deputies of the General Convention of the proposed prohibi
tory canons on the remarriage' of divorced persons' and the discipline for a violation of the
law leaves the 'existing canon in full force and effect. This canon has been accepted for
many years in the Episcopal church and is as follows:
TITLE 2, CANON 1,3 â OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.
Section I. If any persons be joined together othenvise than as,Godh Word doth allozu,
their marriage is not lawful â¢ t /
Section II. No minister, knowingly after due inquiry, shall soleihnize the marriage of any
person zvho has a divorced husband or zvifc still living, if such husband or wife has been put
away for any cause arising after marriage; but this' canon shall not be held to apply to the inno
cent party in a divorce for the cause of adidtery, or to parties once divorced seeking to be united
again. â¢
Section III. If any minister of this church shall have reasonable cause to doubt \u25a0 zvhether
a person desirous of being admitted to holy baptism, or to confirmation, or 'to the holy communion,
has been married otherwise than as the word of God and discipline of this church allow such min
ister, before receiving such person to these ordinances, shall refer the case â¢ to the Bishop for his
godly judgment thereupon; provided, however, that no minister shall, in any case, refuse the sac
raments to a penitent person in imminent danger of death.
. â¢ Section IV. Questions touchinng the facts of any case arising under section H of this
canon shall be referred to the Bishop of the diocese or missionary jurisdiction in which the same
may occur; or if there be no^Bishop^ of such diocese or missionary jurisdiction, then to; some
Bishop to be designated by the standing committee; and the Bishop to whom such questions have
been so referred shall thereupon make inquiry in such manner as he shall deem expedient; and
shall deliver his judgment in the premises.
Section V. This canon, so far as it affixes penalties, does not apply to cases occurring be
fore it takes effect, according to Title IV, canon 4. . \

nineteen voted in the negative and ten
were divided. The lay deputations voted
as .follows: Eighteen for the section;
twenty-four against and nine divided.
In order to have" carried the section
would have had to receive the votes of
thirty lay deputations. The defeat of the
section allows the present canon on dl
.vorce and marriage to remain in force.
The canon is published on another page of
this paper. The canon on "discipline for
divorced' persons who remarry" was voted
down, having been defeated in commit
tee. The. Rev. Dr.- Huntington of -New
York secured the" adoption' of an amend
ment to the constitution providing for the
spiritual oversight of a Bishop of differing

however, with ironclad provisos. "

\u25a0A delegate 'from Minneapolis; laboring under
the Impression \u25a0 that \u25a0 message No. 36 of thÂ«
that would justify Itself to the mind and to
the conscience of the convention. I am frank
to say that I have not felt, especially of late,
satisfied with any form in which our work has
been cast. The . great difficulty is that it is
dangerously easy to put down something that
looks right on paper, and it is awfully difficult
when the concrete case comes .up to . say . that
you have done what is right in the * Bight of
God. In doubtful cases we invite those who
are penitent to come to the holy communion.
We are not allowed to define their penitence for
them. In this matter, since we have no courts
to try it, and the ultimate- court at last is the
court of conscience, I should hesitate to sub
stitute the authority of this convention for
the conscientious verdict of the soul of . the
individual face to face with God. Therefore I
must entirely and positively object to the pro
vision in. this canon which substitutes a pre
sumption of guilt for a presumption of . inno
cence. That' is to subvert a primary principle
of Anglo-Saxon- justice. This is probably a
matter of' pastoral relation, but here it- Is pro
posed to make it a penal regulation, the most
extreme which man can impose."
DB. GREER MAKES A SPEECH.
The Rev. Dr. Greer of "New York followed,
and said:
"I hesitated about taking the platform, ' be
cause I am reluctant to Inflict a speech upon
the committee when I think It Is prepared to
vote upon the question; but I wish simply, to.
state my own position in this matter. And,
first of all; that I am one of those few, If you
please, theorists, \u25a0 if you please, â¢ who -believe in
the lndlssolubillty of the marriage - relation
(Cries, "Good, Good"). I bellevo that thaUhas
been and Is the attitude taken by. a large part
of Christendom to-day with regard to what that
part of Christendom recognizes as a marriage
relation and which it regards as indissoluble.
But I should be - glad 'to have- this church- put
Itself simply upon record as believing and de
claring it3 belief J in that great, high' arid sa
cred principle. I believe that whether it does
it now, the time will come when it will do it,
when all the religious organizations of Chris
tendom will do it; yea, when our Christian civ
ilization will do it, ., and we will come to rec
ognize the fact that it is expedient not simply
because it is expedient, but expedient because
it is right. And ye^ having taken that position
and made that solemn declaration as to Its be
lief and its principles, then I would have this
church go no further; and^ therefore, I would
favor the substitute offered by my friend from
Long Island to strike out this canon with ref
erence to discipline.- -It is. true the- canon pro
vides that the Bishop of a diocese or a district
may adjudicate that matter, that It can bo re
ferred to him. 'Ah, gentlemen, . the office of a
Bishop is a high office in this church; the duty
of a Bishop is a high. duty In this church; but
It is the not the duty of the Bishop, it is the
duty of the priest, in his close. Intimate pas
toral relations Â£o deal .with the crlcumstances
and the details of the case of every Individual
sinner In his congregation. Therefore, I would*
strike out this canon of discipline altogether,
because it is a canon of casuistry, and casuis
try cannot deal \u25a0 with the Individual circum
stances surrounding every individual case.
. "It has â¢ been said - that the . preacher . in tho
pulpit occupies the sublime strategic . point in
the , moral universe. No, , sir; not \u25a0 the
preacher, in the , pulpit occupying that sub
lime strategic point in the -moral uni
verse, but the. minister, or the priest,
or the â¢ pastor when he comes Into touch
with the history, with the pathos, with - the
sorrow of the individual penitent soul occu
pies the sublime strategic point in the universe.
Let -this church put itself: upon record as be
lieving In the great principle, then strike out
the canon of discipline, and put itself on record
with Its MaBter, that 'This man recelveth sin
ners and eateth with them.' " (Cries of "Hear,'
hear.") >\u25a0 â¢ ' 'â¢. ' \u25a0\u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0 - \u25a0\u25a0>\u25a0
" The Rev. Dr. Spalding arose at this juncture
to ask if. a certain portion' of the amendment
were stricken out in. what condition would it
leave the church's ' legislation | on â¢ the subject ?
The chairman replied -that - each- member of
the committee must determine that for him
self. I ' : v \u25a0 - \u25a0 \u25a0 : . V -\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ ,;>.

FIGURES TO STUDY.
'From these fierures," the report says, "we
are to study the state of the ' church, ever
mindful of the fact tha.t mere figures can never
plve us more than a partial conception of Its
conditions. The returns of the number of
clergymen and ordinations show an increase of
f-omethlng less than 6 per cent, while the num
ber of communicants has Increased a little
Jess than s per cent.
"The conditions of church life are nucb that
It is to be expected that the communicants
will Increase more rapidly than the clergy, yet
we believe this showing is an admonition to us
that we ought to pray more earnestly than
heretofore that the l>ord of the harvest would
send forth more laborers into his field.
This duty Is impressed upon us more strongly
when we find that the ordinations to dlaconate
and priesthood number 87 less in the last three
ypars than in the like time preceding the last
General Convention. Then to reinforce the les-
BOH w find that there are 69 fewer candidates
end nostulants for holy orders and nearly 200
-ewer lay readers than there were three years
e?o. Ana again, we find the number of Bun
cay-school teacher* fewer by 377 now than
i Men.
"Your committee re-echoes the cry that these
dumb figures utter â men are wanted; educated,
trained, devoted men to labor in the various
activities of the church's life. "We trust that
the youth of the church will be alert to re
spond to the call to service."
When Dr. Duncan concluded reading the re
port, he offered the following resolution, which
was adopted:
"Resolved, That a copy of the report pre
sented be transmitted, to the reverend fathers
in God. the House of Bishops, with the re
quest that they Issue a pastoral letter and ask
their united prayers and benedictions."

REMARRIAGE IS .NOT PROHIBITED
House of Bishops was going to be voted upon,
tried to have it amended, but Chairman Pack
ard ruled his amendment was out of order. .
The Rev. Dr. Hopkins of Chicago followed
with a sharp speech and supplemented it with
an . amendment asking the House of Deputies
not to concur with message 36 of the House. of
Bishops. \u25a0 Chairman Packard ruled that such
an amendment would be proper in the House
of Deputies, but not before the committee of the
whole.
A motion was then made on the following:
resolution and carried:,
"Resolved, the House of Deputies concur
ring. That sections 3, 4 and 5 of message No.
36 be repealed." .'. '
The question next came up on the report of
the \u25a0 House of Deputies in adopting the reso
lution as so amended.
â¢ Upon motion the committee of the whole
arose and Chairman Packard, after reporting,
asked that the committee be discharged from
further consideration of the subject and that
the message be made the order of the day
immediately upon the assembling of the house
in the afternoon.' It was so ordered.
A message from the House of Bishops in
formed the House of Deputies that it had con
curred in message No. 32, with reference to
marginal readings for the apocrypha.. An
other message informed the deputies that the
Bishops had adopted a resolution concurring
with the version of the . prayer book in the
German language and approved its being print
ed and ' used by German-speaking congrega
tions. Another- message was received to the
effect that the Bishops had J received the re
port of the Joint commission on the church of

that he did not wish the sympathy of any

an interesting description of the work

Dr. Huntington read this report, which is as
follows: . .
."With reference to the amendment to. article

the words â¢ 'of the General Convention,' and
before the last proviso the following: 'Provided

have further inserted the word 'all' " before

VOTES AGAINST DISCIPLINING.
â¢ ; The house then took up the report of the com-'
mittee of the whole on the canon for disciplin
ing, divorced persons who remarry, which was
defeated I in the committee.
The Rev. Dr. Mann of West . Missouri moved
ed to transmit a copy of the resolutions to the
family of deceased.
Under suspension of the rules, on motion of
Rev. Dr. Mann of West Missouri, the resolu
tions offered by him a few days ago continuing
the commission on marginal readings and au
thorizing the printing of the readings at an
expense not to exceed $500 were taken from
the calendar and adopted.
On motion of Dr. McConnell the house re
solved itself into a committee of the whole
to take a vote upon the canon relating to
marriage and divorce. Chairman Packard took
the chair and called thÂ« members" attention to
the value of time: He suggested that all tho
members could not be heard on the subject, but
could show their attitude by their votes.
DISCUSSION ON DISCIPLINE.
Dr. McConnell of Long Island was the first
speaker to take the platform. In part he said:
"The matter before us is the proposed amend
ment to canon 13 as sent down by the House
of Bishops. That canon provides that any man
or woman who has been divorced and remar
ries, or -who, having been divorced, remarries
the person who is divorced, shall lpso facto
be excommunicated, and it provides that the
Bishop in any case may set aside this canon,
no matter what is the cause of the divorce.'
"I simply ask, do you want to pass it? Do
you want to discharge not only the individual
but every power of discipline in . this church
and turn it over absolutely to the Bishop in
his own diocese?
"If you do you will allow as many excuses
as there are dioceses in the country. One
Bishop may claim that marriage is - indissolu
ble; another will take the ground that there are
two or three more scriptural causes that al
low divorce and permit the divorced persons to
be in good church standing. You will then
find the church as the States are now doing,
regulating what the causes of divorce must be.
Why, then, is it that such a monstrous canon
as that is sent down to us from so wise and
Intelligent a house? The reason is very sim
ple. We are confronted with a task so diffi
cult that we have been now nearly twenty
years trying all sorts of devices to meet it.
HOUSE WANTS TO DO BIGHT.
"This house wants to do right. I do not
believe there is any disposition . on the part
of any member of this house to "simply carry
his point. I believe every member Is willing
to let the State grant the divorce. We are
all satisfied that it should grant the divorce,
but we want the power regulated. There aro
100,000 divorced persons in the United States.
Of these divorces 70 per cent have been grained
by women. Now gentlemen, does this conven
tion want to say that the State shall ! grant
no divorces? Is that what you want? Is there
any gentleman here willing to say that he
wishes the State to grant no divorces? I don't
believe there are ten men on this floor to
say it. -We want the State to grant them, but
what we '.want is to have the Individual power
regulated."
Robert Treat Paine of Massachusetts fol
lowed and said: '
"May a layman say a serious word from his
heart in solemn protest against this canon of
prohibition? It seems to me ap awful thing
for the church to be so eager to prevent men
and women coming to the communion of our
Lord. If there is any question about a person's
coming and he Is forbidden on the ground of
sin, I almost say that I am on the side of the
sinner. . â¢ r
"I wish also to call the attention of this
house to the dreadful Inconsistency . between
this proposed canon and that which was consid
ered yesterday and temporarily adopted. Under
that the proposed parties who are to be married
after divorce come up to the church door on
Thursday asking to be married, and the door is
shut in their faces and the blessings of the
church is refused on Thursday morning, but on
Sunday morning they come up and are welcome
to the communion- of- our- Lord." \u25a0
Rev. Dr. .Fulton of Pennsylvania said: . '
"I think it only right to say with regard to
the committee of this house which has been in
charge of this fearful subject during the last
three years that they have been . struggling
most conscientiously to prepare something
PROGRAMME OF LAST DAY BUT ONE
O F EPISCOPAL CHURCH CONVENTION
TyT/ITH the sessions to-day and to-morrow of 'the House of Bishops and the House of Depu
y y ties, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church will be brought to a close.
This morning the two houses zvill meet in Trinity Church at io and will also resume
in the afternoon at 2:30. â¢ Considerable business remains to be transacted and the two bodies zvill

The Bishops received a message from
the House of Deputies to the effect that
they had concurred in the report on mar
ginal readings.
The committee on prayer-book asked
that the version In the German language
bÂ« accepted. This was done by the
Dr. Mann is & prominent rector of his
State. He is a man of commanding
presence and is an able speaker. Dur
ing the present session of the House of
Deputies he has been to the front on all
important questions. He took a very
prominent part in the learned considera
tion of marginal readings, which came up
before both houses.
The house confirmed the election of the
four Bishops who were elected by the
Deputies, and committees were appointed
to apprise the fortunate clerics who were
chosen by the high honor. Cablegrams
were Bent to Dr. Brown and Dr. Ingalls,
who are respectively In Brazil and Han
kow.
Bishops nominated by
the Tipper house, the Bishops proceeded
to discuss the qualifications of a candi
date worthy to fulfill the arduous duties
of missionary Bishop to the vacant dis
trict of North Dakota. Their choice fell
upon the Rev. Cameron Mann of West
Missouri, who has taken "a leading- part
in the discussions in the House of Depu
ties. The choice of the House of Bish
ops was unanimous, and the House of
Deputies was immediately informed of
the selection.
WHEN the House of Bish
ops received word from
the House of Deputies
yesterday that the latter
had only elected four out
of the five missionary
House of Bishops and an authorization
was given to have the translation printed
and used by congregations using the Ger
man language.
The report of the joint committee on
the church In Sweden was presented. The
committee stated that it had not time
to take definite action, and urgently rec
ommended the most. cordial relation with
the church of Sweden and that the work
among- the Swedish immigrants be
pushed. The report was referred to the
committee on ecclesiastical relations.
The joint committee on the validity of
the Reform Episcopal church asked to
be allowed to continue and report at the
next General Convention. The request
was granted.
The following nominations were made
for the general relief fund:
The Bishops of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
Rev. Morgan Dix of New York. Rev. Reeves
Alsop of Lone Island, William Alexander
Smith. Elihu Chauncey and George C. Thomas
of Pennsylvania.
The House of Bishops elected Bishop
Potter to prepare the pastoral letter for
1904 and to consult with the Bishops of
Southern Virginia and Albany. The pas
toral letter to be read to-morrow night

tucky, and the latter will be assisted by
the Bishops of New York and Alabama.
The house also received the testimonials
of the Bishops elected by the House of
Deputies, and they were referred to the
committee on consecrations. An ad
journment was taken until this morning.
The i committee on capital and labor,
which Is composed of the Bishops â¢ of
New York and Massachusetts and the
Coadjutor of Chicago, submitted a se
ries of resolutions on the subject. These

ACHIEVES DECISIVE VICTORY IN CONVENTION
5CAPTAIN CARL POHLE, ONE OF THE OLDEST MARINERS OF THE
NORTH GERMAN LLOYD COMPANY. WHO HAS MADE A RECORD
TVITH 176 ROUND VOYAGES TO NEW TORK. , . . ,*\
The colonel's Bolides are well known. They could
not be nailed up into a. platform nor kept out of a
bottle. The colonel represents the Star-eyed God
dess of .Reform, straight liquor, the boys in the
trenches and the spread eagle rampant in red all over
the blue sky. He is for everything that begins with
a capital letter â Liberty, Law,- Fraternity, Peace,
Commerce, Labor, Capital, Man, Lovely Woman,
the Xorth. the South, the East and the West, the
Union and Glory Hallelujah. His letter of accept
ance would read like a speech following. a Fourth of
July banquet at about 2 o'clock in the morning. It
\u25a0would have the aroma of the preprandial cocktail, the
sparkle of champagne, the fervor of old rye and the ]
manifold. subtle elegances of the pousse cafe. It
would have a charm for all minds and a tickle for
everj- fane}-. It would be a record-breaker and an
epoch-maker in the way of public documents, and for
generations to come Democrats would hold annual
festivals for the purpose of reading it over and try
ing to live up to it for just one night.
It will be remembered that when the election con- -
test of 1876 was decided in favor of Hayes Colonel
Watterson called for 100,000 men to march on Wash
ington and seat Tilden. It was as brave a warwhoop.
as ever was heard on "the dark and bloody ground"
even -in. the 4a}'s when Daniel Boone and the red
skins yelled against one another. " It was not only a
ringing thing in itself, but it inspired others to ring,
&n<J it set Joe Blackburn to shouting his immortal
slogan, "He who dallies is a dastard, and he who
doubts is damned."
. That is what Watterson did for Tilden, .but no im
agination can depict what he wiil do for himself
should he be nominated, or what he Would do should
he be counted out. It-is certain. there would be a
great uproar^ in the country, from the frozen lakes
to the sun-kissed waves of the Gulf, and from the
stormy billows of the Atlantic to the gentle rippies*
of the far-reaching Pacific, but nobody would be
alarmed. Everybody would know that the country
is nit. The Star-eyed Goddess of Reform talks
much, but she never bites. Her tongue is fierce, but'
her hands are lily white and her eyes are full of
benediction. The people would understand the ex
uberant candidate. Some would call him '"Colonel,",
some would call him "Hank," and some would call
him "Henri," but all would call, him a good fellow
End vote against him with & sigh.
It is therefore to be hoped that Kentucky will stand
by Watterson and give the country a good blue grass
Â»ace for its money in the next Presidential sweep-y
ftake;. Bryan was too bitter, and'Quincy of Mas
faehusetts would be too sour. Watterson would be
Jtift right. As a candidate for the Presidency- he
would be the sweetest thing that ever raised tumul-
Cuous cheering and never got a vote.
REPORTS from Louisville are to the effect
that Colonel Henry Watterson has announced
that he is a candidate for "the Governorship of
Kentucky, and it is added that if elected it is believed
bc^will be a candidate for the Democratic nomination
for the Presidency in 1904, The report is not only
"'important, if true," but is decidedly- good if true.
What we will need in this country at the next elec
tion will be a good old-fashioned, light-hearted,
everybody-is-Jiappy, whoop^it-up ' campaign, and
Watterson will give it to us. * â¢
It matters not upon what platform he be nomi
r.ated, free silver or free gold, the lost cause or the
v.-inning. cause, his personality will be bigger than the
pianks hiVtect are placed on. In fact, as soon as the
campaign got fairly started Colonel. Watterson would
be sure to leap from the platform to the blue grass,
swing his hat over all the country round and make
the welkin ring with a bugle blast all his own. After
that no one would pay any attention to planks, plat
forms, policies or principles. Throughout the coun
try there would be but one questionâ Are you for the
colonel or agin him?

Sardou fell 'in love with and married his
benefactress, whose death, ten ye'ars
later, was the one great sorrow of his life.
Sardou has made more money than any
other dramatist, and he is probably the
only man who ever gave Sarah Bernhardt
a shaklner.
The incident occurred at a rehearsalâ
and - at a period when the divine Sarah
was less eminent than she Is now. j They
differed as to the way In which a passage
should be declaimed, and Sardou, losing
his temper, seized the actress, by the
shoulder and gave her a shaking. She re
torted by slapping his face, and afterward
challenged him to a duel!
VIctorien Sardou was married under the
most romantic circumstances. As a young
man he worked and starved in a garret,
and, disappointment preyed upon his
nerves till . he fell ill. A young actress*

Kangaroo Famine.
There is likely soon to be an exceptional
demand for kangaroos In consequence of
the success attending the use of the kan
garoo tendon in the hospitals. It has been
employed in scores of instances to tie up
â¢ the fractured bones of a man's leg, In or
der that he may use his knees while the
bones are knitting: together.
Kangaroo tendon is as strong as silver
wire. It is taken from the tail, and being
animal in its nature, is absorbed, and the
leg does not have to be cut open, as is
necessary when silver wire is used.
The mandibles of ' the ant are used In
somewhat the same way to stitch up a
cut. The insect is made to catch hold of
each aide of the wound with Its mandibles
and bring the edges together. Its body
is then nipped off with a pair of forceps,
and the mandibles are left in the flesh,
acting in this way as a surgical stitch.

"YES. SIR"â H. S. G.. City. If a young
lady employed in a business house re
sponded to the call of a junior member of
the house and in answer to a question or
direction to perform a certain task she
replied "yes, sir," or "no, sir," that should
not be considered as evidence of subser
viency or servility. It is an evidence of
good breeding. An employe cannot afford
to be rude to an employer, be It the senior
or any member of the firm. Whether
"yes" or "yea, sir," should be used often
times'depends upon circumstances and
conditions and these must govern.
GRAVING DOCKâ W. T., City. There
Is no difference between a graving dock
and a drydock. Graves are the dregs at
the bottom of a pot used for melting tal
low. Ships before the use of pitch or tar
was Introduced had their hulls well
gravedâ that Is, greased with graves, or
impure tallow. To do this it was neces
sary that the hull should be dry. A grav
ing dock was therefore a dock into which
a ship could be floated and the water aft
erward drawn off, so that the graving
process could go on. The process of grav
ing has become obsolete, but the name of
graving dock has. been retained.

immediately over the north end of tho
needle and the card moves with the
needle. The cardinal points are marked
with the letters N., S., E., W.; and the
Intermediate points by an ingenious sys
tem, of notation showing the variation
from true north. For Instance the points
of the star between N. and E. are marked
NbE, NNE. NEbN. NE, NEbE, ENE,
EbN. And so the other divisions are
marked as to the cardinal points.
NOTICE TO QUITâ X. T. Z., City. If
a party rents a flat by the month in the
absence of any agreement the tenancy
terminates at the end of the month for
â¢which the rent is paid and the tenant
may leave without notice. On the other
hand, the owner of the premises may give
the tenant a reasonable notice that he de
sires the premises at the end of the month.
Fifteen days' notice is a reasonable no
tice. If the tenant refused to quit the
landlord would follow the common prac
tice of three days' notice to. quit and if
not obeyed would commence an action for
unlawful detainer, which would Involve a
case In court with judgment against the
tennnt, who would be taxed the costs.
RENTâ Old Subscriber, City. In the ab
sence of any agreement a party who rents
a house or a flat by the month, payable
in advance, is bound for a full month's
rent even though he ipmalns in the prem
ises but a day. In a case of that kind the
tenant could lock up the place and hold
the key until the end of the month. A
tenant who rents a place for a month is
not required to give notice of a desire to
vacate at any time during the month, un
less there is an understanding requiring
such notice.
THE course of business is forward, with no sign
that its impetus is spent. When President Me-.
Kinley fell there were many who for a' moment
feared the effect upon credit and commerce. Europe
was evidently expecting that the crime would, start
a panic here. But there was no perceptible reversed
The national administration changed, with no changed
in the financial .or commercial policy of the country,
and business moves so confidently that the Secretary
of the Treasury finds it unnecessary to remain at his
post in readiness to protect the public credit, and
goes for a rest much needed, after the sorrows of his
own house and the great tragedy that touched him in
his official relations. Money continues easy and is
not lacking for legitimate investment. The market
has sustained unshaken the wild speculation in over-'
land railroad stocks and the loss of the President,
and is strong on all sides.
This situation is propitious for American enter
prise at home and abroad. The coming Pan-
American Congress in the City of Mexico is expected
to suggest to American capital the profits of busi
ness development in Central and South America.
Those countries are old in their political character,
but are yet new in industrial and productive develop
ment. They are at our doors. The Nicaragua canal
is about to open a channel of transportation that will
connect their east and west coasts by the easiest,
cheapest communication, and our capital is needed
for their development and needs the .profij: to be won
in the process. The greatest extension of energy
known to the age is the industrial application of elec
tricity. If business maintain its present stability,
meritorious enterprises -in ithis State which depend
upon electricity developed by hydraulic power will
get the capital needed for their development. North
ern California is not yet in action with electricity,
though its mineral development supplies an increas
ing demand for that ready agency. This State is to
be the scene of the greatest development by electricity
used as power known to the world. The narrowness
of our borders, the great mountain wall on the east T
ward with, its unlimited 'supply of water power,
from plants that arc in easy distance from every part
of the coast to which wires can carry power, suggest
the most favorable situation known in > the world.
With money easy and capital seeking investment. we
may expect greater attention than ever to the con
ditions here which invite capital.
In the rules laid/down to regulate the costumes
to be worn at the coronation of King Edward, it is
prescribed that a baroness shall wear a train three
feet long, a viscountess one of a yard and a quarter,
a countess one and one-half yards, a marchioness one
and three-quarter yards and a duchess a train- two
yards long. It is furthermore forbidden to- any one
to wear counterfeit gems of any kind. As a spectacu
lar performance King Edward purposes to show that
the rear thing can beat the stage, any day.

ONCE* upon -a,., time the,. American people
a watched the annual statistics of immigration
. Jwith a degree of satisfaction . that was
heightened vyhenever the number showed an increase
over, that of. the previous year. That sort of indis
criminate welcome to. all who came is no longer
.prevalent. We now study the statistics- of the immi
gration bureau with some care and are not always
most pleased when the figures are highest.
The recently published summary of the immigra
tion statistics for the fiscal year just past is of a nature
that will renew, and increase the demand for a re
vision of our immigration laws in the direction of
greater' restriction. The number of immigrants who
arrived during the year was about 20 per cent more
than that of the previous year, and a notable feature
of the increase is thnt it comes mostly from Eastern
and Southern Europe. The increase or decrease in
the number of immigrants of the different nationali
ties for the last fiscal year as compared with the pre
vious year is given in the following table:

The Commissioner reports that there was a larger
proportion of illiteracy among the immigrants of last
year than in the former year. The amount of money
per capita increased .from $13 49 in 1900 to $14 12 in
1901. There was also an increase in the proportion,
of women who came over last year, and this the
Commissioner interprets, as a, sign that- the families
intend to make their homes here. â¢
.An important feature of the report is the statement
of the Commissioner concerning the lack of any ade
quate provision of law by which anarchists can be
excluded from the country. It is stated that the vari
ous' suggestions which have been made to that. end
are either inadequate or are impracticable. rThe per
plexing factqr of the problem is the. difficulty of de
fining what'eonstitutes an anarchist and of determin
ing , what. individuals are anarchists: This is one of
the questions Congress will have to deal with this
winter. Perhaps it will not be possible to devise a
law. that will; exclude the "Reds'; altogether, but
something may be, done to keep out the bolder and
more dangerous of their agitators. ' - : \-
IMMIGRATION STATISTICS.
MARINE SKETCHES-N. C., Santa
Cruz, Cal. A young man who " cai * make
good 'sketches, ' particularly marine
sketches, and who would be delighted to
see some of them in the newspaper press,"
should submit them to the newspaper
pres3 and if available they will no doubt
appear. A young man might think hi3
sketches were "just the thing" for a
newspaper, while the manager of a paper
and the head of the art department might
think otherwise.

DECORATING AND DRAPINGâSub
scriber, City. A person who desires to bi>
correct would not say in placing emblems
of mourning on his premises "I am dec
orating my house In respect to the mem
ory of our late President," but he would
say "I am draping my house." Decorat
ing carries with it the Idea of pleasure,
while draping gives more fully the idea of
sorrow.

Speaking of the emotional tendences of
the negro in religious affairs, Mr. "Wash

went to an* Episcopal church. She went
up to the gallery and prepared to enjoy
the services. She grew steadily more and

CAPTAIN CARL. POHLE of .the North German Lloyd Company recently
completed 176 round transatlantic trips, traversing 1.609.610 miles, this be
ing a record among trans-Atlantic captains. Captain Pohle is atypical
specimen of the hardy mariners whom the North German Lloyd has con
tributed to Germany's commercial marine in Its modern era of develop
me There are now many captains In the British. Danish and German services
who' have scored the hundredth round trip as captains between Europe and Amer
ica but Captain Pohle, who has been celebrated in verse by George Francis Train,
has become* by his long and honorable career, the dean of the personnel of the
ereat German shipping company. Iwhich numbers over six thousand men. The of
ficers and sailors of its fleet are mostly recruited, when mere boys, from the
Drovinces on the coast of the German North Sea, and only after a long apprentice

in practical navigation is the grade of captain attained. .

CHINESEâ J. S.. City. The article en
titled "Can you speak Chinese?" relative
to the Chinese language appeared in the
Call of October 15. 1900.
HIGH SCHOOLâ A. B. C. City. There
Is not an evening high school for .ladies
in San Francisco.
NEITHER of the-regular parties in this city seems to havt fully appreciated the
danger that liesin the political situation. They did not ; Jdiily consider the risk
that must always be taken irr the election of a Mayor , uncHr the new charter. That
officer becomes responsible in a high degree, and alone, for the peace and order
of the city. About the candidates for the Board of Supervisors thete can be but little hesi
tation. On each : ticket 'there are good elements and bad. On the Republican ticket there
is a maximum and on the 'Democratic a minimum of bad element?. Citizens who desire
to see the city protected against what evil bad Supervisors may do will prefer not to
support the Republican ticket. The minimum of good elements i^xm it cannot control
it, nor can the minimum of bad on the; Democratic ticket control that. The latter is, there
fore, likely to be preferred by all citizens who desire to shut out what evil may enter, the
government by way of the Board of Supervisors. ,.- . :!'
When the candidates for Mayor are discussed entirely novel considerations must
be reckoned with. In the strenuous period of the late strike, a convention was constituted
to nominate a city ticket. The men who went into that movement went apart and formed
a political party for municipal purposes. They impeached the existing city administration
not for any evil it had done, but for the good it tried to do in the enforcement of public
order and the protection of citizens in their personal and property rights. The tick'et
these men nominateil; 4s -.of^necessity pledged to withdraw from citizens that measure of
protection should such another emergency arise, and that it will arise instantly upon the
success of this class ticket no one doubts. Two such .catastrophes close together' ; are
more than this city and State can stand without serious and probably permanent injury.
To our mind there, is only one way in which such a serious risk can be averted.- If the
substantial, citizens of this city .'divide their strength between the two candidates* of the
regular parties, the class ticket headed by Mr. Schmitz will be inspired to a great effort
for success. Its supporters desire only the election of the head of the ticket. With the
Mayor secured every business and industrial interest in San Francisco will find its throat
in the grasp of the element which so lately was quite willing to inflict damage upon itself
in the hope of doing greater injury to others. True, it lost and it suffered in losing, but
that only increases its desire for recoupment through having a : Mayor of its own to give
it free hand next time it disturbs the industrial peace and prosperity of this community.
.This danger overgrows all others.^ If business men, who found and promote the
enterprises upon which the life of San Francisco depends, choose to divide their strength
between the two regular candidates for Mayor,- they are taking a risk of the most dan
gerous and painful^ nature. Granting that, neither is anideal candidate in this emergency,
still, either is better than the avowed representative of public disorder and lawlessness.
San Francisco. had one experience that should admonish her not to commit her destiny
to a class element, with only one idea of the purpose of government. The vote of the
substantial interests of this city must be pooled and plumped for one candidate for Mayor
or the consequences may be more serious than have followed the political mistakes of the
past. Of this the two regular candidates should be made aware, if they do not know it
already. The interests of a great city are higher than their personal interests or ambitions.
The city will applaud whichever will solve the problem by seeing its most serious as
pects, and sinking his personal ambition for the public good.
We say this very seriously and with a desire that the mistakes already made shall
not lead to worse. : We' say itJtoo,Heeiing that the very class that seeks to grasp adminis
tration for the purpose of further of business peace will' suffer the most, in a
personal .sense, from the policy it contemplates. The banishing of frightened capital and
enterprise will fall hardesFupon our laboring population who are being asked to help
effect it. They are less mobile than that which they me.nace. They, cannot follow it to a
new location, but must stand-in their tracks and see it go/ taking with it their chance for
profitable employment to be bestowed upon others while they suffer. These considera
tions, we are well aware, .do not influence them, nor in the least stay their hands nor abate
their intention.. In that very lack of sensibility tothe effect of what they propose is the
great danger. of the community and the greater danger to themselves.-
We have tried to point plainly the risk, and wait for the remedy to appear.

Haddcn Hall Is Nearly Wrecked.
The British bark Haddon Hall, now ly
ing at Sausalito, has had a most remark
able experience during the voyage that
will end at Queenstown some time next
year. She came within an ace of being
wrecked on the Columbia River bar and
Robert Griffiths, an apprentice boy. was
washed overboard and drowned. Griffiths
had previously nursed the entire ship's
crew through the yellow fever while the
bark was lying in Panama Bay. He waa
the first to be taken down and when he
recovered he nursed the men as they were
ftrlck.cn one after the other. Three sail
ors died and the priests refused them
burial at Panama, so Captain Prltchard
had to inter them at night on a mountain
side and say the prayers over them him
self.
While passing through the Chilollo
Straits on her way to Portland the Had
don.Hall was beset by pirates, but the
'â¢rev.- managed to beat them off. An ap-
Iirentice boy was shot in the encounter.
u was while pasing in over the Columbia
River bar, however, that the Haddon Hall
1-ad her narrowest escape. Had it not
been for the skill and seamanship of Cap
tain Pritchard and the pilot the vessel
v.*ould undoubtedly have been wrecked
and all hands drowned.

I found that there was a little prejudice down
there against the Oceanic StÂ°amshlv> Company,
the result of jealousy or another steamship line,
but we will ultimately gee the New South Wales
and Victorian mails. I couferred with the
postal/authorities of those two big States and
feel \u25a0 confident that . the time Is not far dis
tant when our- vessels wlU be carrying all
the English mails of those States.
Of course if we handle the mall from that
country we will handle all the traffic. I
think we will get the mall service we are Beck
ing. The trip to Europe by this route la
much more pleaeant than the trip through
thÂ£ Red Sea, where for two weekB the pas-
Bet.gers are forced' to swelter in a climate
with the thermometer at 112 degrees. Why,
on' the trip on ;the Oceanic line the thermom
eter never goes higher than 85 degrees. Then
the company has fine steamers and grand ac
commodations.
I was in the Parliament at Melbourne the

Mr. Loud was greatly impressed with

quence easy to fortify.

I THISTLES AND DANIXRUFP.
An Interesting Parallel and a i Val-
uable Deduction Therefrom.
j Cutting down thistles no more relieves
the land of thistles than does scouring
the scalp cure dandruff. In each case per-
manent relief can only come from eradi-
cating ' permanently the cause. A germ
that plows up the scalp in searching for
the hair root, where it saps the vitality,
causes dandruff, falling:, hair and. bald-
ness. If you kill that germ, you'll have
no dandruff ," but a luxuriant suit of hair.
Newbro's Herpicide is the only hair prep-
aration in the; world that cures dandruff,
falling hair, and baldness . by killing the
germ. "Destroy the cause, you remove"
the effect.'.' â¢ . jThe United States Grand Jury returned
a true bill of indictment yesterday
against William Hagan for having In pos
session and passing notes of the defunct
State Bank of New Brunswick. Hagan
was associated with Charles J. Perry and
E. W. Smith, confidential clerk of Major
Blakeney. superintendent of> the United
States life saving service at this port.
Smith owns a half interest in a curiosity
shop on Montgomery street and imported
a large quantity of the worthless notes
which the rest of the gang disposed of.
Perry is an ex-convict and will be used
as the principal Government witness.

CALL BUREAU, 1106 G STREET, N.
W.. "WASHINGTON. Oct. 13.â Sixteen
million dollars is the sum saved the Gov
ernment as the result of the economical
policy inaugurated last summer by Secre
tary Root.
Acting Secretary Sanger to-day trans
mitted to the Treasury Department the
official estimates of the department for
the support of the army for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1903. These esti
mates amount to $39,000,000, and the ap
propriations made by Congress for the
support of the army during the present
fiscal year aggregate $115,735,649.
Acting Secretary Sanger is now revising
the estimates for public works. These In
clude $20,000,000 for river and harbor im
provements. No river and harbor bill
was passed during the last session, so
that the estimates will be for work that
must.be continued. Slight savings have
also been made in the civil establishments
in connection v/ith the Â«rmy, and in mis
cellaneous expenses. It Is considered
that estimates for the military establish
ment, civil establishment, public works,
exclusive of rivers and harbors and mis
cellaneous, will be at least 520,000,000 be
low the appropriations.
The officials of the "War Department
say that the reduction in the estimates la
due entirely to an order issued last sum
mer by Mr. Root. The Secretary called
the attention of the officers of the army
to extravagance, always a consequence of
\u25a0war, and urged them to pull the Govern
ment's purse strings more tightly than
they had done since the war with Spain
began.
The great savings made In the estimates
have been principally in three depart
ments, the pay, subsistence and quarter
master departments. In the last-named
department the abolition of the transport
service on the Atlantic coast and the use
only of Government transports on the Pa
cific have contributed largely to the com
paratively moderate estimates submitted
by the quartemaster general.

Two -worthy objects to be furthered and
the most attractive programme ever pre
sented to San Francisco tbeater-gxtersâ
surely the Grand Opera-house should be
aswarm with people Thursday afternoon.
For on this occasion, the third annual
benefit of the Associated Theatrical Man
agers, half of the proceeds is to be de
voted to the usual objectâ the relief of
needy theatrical peopleâ and half will be
contributed to the McKInley memorial
fund.
The. entertainment \u25a0will commence
promptly at 1 o'clock and will be a con
tinuous performance, the curtain never
going down until the last of the moving
pictures at the end of the programme
has flickered across the stage.
The Royal Italian Band will furnish a
feature new to these benefits, and will
give the public a treat which San Fran
cisco despaired of having. This incom
parable company of musicians \u25a0will march
through the streets from the Alhambra
Theater to the Grand Opera-house, going
by. way of Market and Third streats. at
noon in parade in honor ol the benefit
entertainment. The band's part in the
programme also will not be the least en
joyable of the numbers. Those who have
heard it will be glad to hear it agnin in
tho larger playhouse. Creatore will, of
course, wield the baton â¢with his usual
characteristic energy and rhythmic grace.
Florodora Young Hen as Ushers.
The charming girls of the "Florodora"
company will form a reception committee
â they and the handsome young men -who
stepped out of society somewhere for the
pleasure of singing henceforth with the
stunning sextet. The girls have prom
ised to be most gracious in the bestowal
.of smiles and fetching nods. They will
also dispense flowers at so much per, and
the "Johnnie" who fails to purchase a
boutonniere need no longer hope to find
favor in the eyes that set his heart
a-flutter.
The young men of the double sextet
will assist in ushering, and the matinee
girls, who are wroth at the city for its
comparative neglect of their idols while it
has raved about the bewitching partners
of those idols, will not lose the opportu
nity to see the handsome youths outside
of the glare of the calcium.
Dainty Grace Dudley, she of the real
and altogether delightful English accent,
will sing "When I Leave Town," but the
audience â¢will never let her escape until
she has given them "Tact" also.
Their Best Remarkably, Good.
Each theater Is to send its best, and
the best in each is Just now remarkably
good. â¢ \u25a0
Russo and Collamarinl from the Tlvoli
will give the last act of "Carmen," and
the Tivoll company will present the fa
mous River Jordan scene from "Nabuc
co," Dado singing the solo. These scenes
will be given in costume and â¢with the
complete stage settings.
The Grand Opera-house stock company
will contribute an act from "The Uttle
Minister." .
From the Orpheum there will be Tommy
Baker, the monologtst: "Wilfred Clark**
and- company, giving "Oscar's Birthday";
the De Courcy brothers, acrobats, and
Mitchell and Bernard, the vocalists.
Every one will be delighted- to hear
Camille d'Arville, who, since she became
Mrs. Crellin, is seldom heard in public,
and then only when some worthy charity
appeals to her unselfish heart.
The little people of the Pollard Austra
lian juvenile opera company, who arrived
yesterday on the Sonoma, will give the
last act of the "Belle of New York."
From the California, Mason and Mason
and Lottie "WilHams-Salter will give
bright bits from "Ruaolph and Adolph."
The Alcazar and the Central theater
people will play the second act of "Too
Much Johnson." The Chutes will con
tribute the newest moving pictures. â¢â¢

Pour Men Arrested on Suspicion Are
j. Released After an Inves
tigation.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday denied the motion for arrest of
Judgment in the case' of John M. Neall,
convicted of forging the name of Quar
termaster Long to a voucher.for money
deposited with Neall by Trooper John
Cranson of the Fourth Cavalry. Judge
de Haven said that had the objection to
the indictment been rai?ed by Neall's at
torney on demurrer to the indictment, he
might have sustained the demuner; but
it was too late after the trial to object
to the indictment. The point made thus
tardily by Crittenden Thornton, attorney
for Neall. was that the indictment was
void because it failed to allege that Colo
nel Long was authorized to sign vouch
ers such as was the one alleged to be
forged by Neall.
Sentence upon Neall will be passed
probably this morning.
Attorney Thornton will appeal from
Judge de Haven's decision.

William Greenway Is Booked on the
Charges of Bobbery and
Petty Larceny. f
William Greenway was booked at the
City Prison yesterday morning on charges
of robbery and petty larceny. Ho was ar
rested by Policeman Ross on warrants
sworn out some weeks ago.
Greenway, who is 19 years of age, is the
leader of a gang of hoodlums who infest
Second and Third streets. September 7
they attacked three Chinese on Third
street and knocked one of the Chinese
senseless. They then stole the basket of
flowers he was carrying. The empty bas
ket was found near the residence of
Greenway' s parents on Clementina street.
On the night of September 15 six of the
gang entered a saloon at Second and Te
hama streets and ordered beer. After
drinking the beer they refused to pay for
it They then took two of the glasses and
threw them through the plate glass win
dow of the saloon. Jean Paternost, a
friend of the barkeeper, who happened to
be in the saloon, went outside to expos
tulate with the gang and they attacked
him, knocking him down and robbing him.
He has not yet fully recovered from the
beating he received.
Wheelmen Hold Indoor Race.
A delightful entertainment was given by
the San Francisco Wheelmen last night
at Native Sons' Hall. The feature of the
evening was a home trainer bicycle race,
in which the" Bay City Wheelmen were
represented by Charles Long and J. Hob
son, California Cycling Club by L. E
Clifton and A. Mitchell and the San Fran
cisco Wheelmen by Al Knox and N. B.
Borree. Aside from the race an interest
ing programme was rendered. The affair
was concluded with a dance.
Thinks Bullfights Are Planned.
TheSociedad Frontones Americanos has
a large amphitheater well j toward com
pletion in Central Park, where the pro
moters expect to introduce a popular
Spanish game known as, "Basco." Secre
tary Holbrook of the Society for the pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals states that
R?. i as J nfo Â«nation which leads him to
think that the amphitheater is designed

that bullfighting will not be allowed by
the society which he represents.
Involuntary Insolvent.
Creditors of L. H. Campbell, a merchant
of Eureka, petitioned the United States
District Court yesterday to declare him
an involuntary- insolvent They allege
that he owes them as follows: Haas
Bros., $231 42; H. Levi & Co., $186 45; Harry

Co., $199 20.
bet down on him and apparently saw no
chance for him -to lose. If Walcott and
O'Rourke have . really dissolved partner
ship, which few people here believe, the
New York manager \u25a0 will | have much to
gloat over. His control over the colored
boxer was so complete that the latter
would not dare to quit if he was behind
him.
Colored Man Not Cheerful.
Walcott was far from being as chipper
when he entered the ring as he was the
night he fought Gardner. He did not look
at all cheerful. He usually sees all his
friends at the ringside, but last night had
salutations for those in his immediate
surroundings only. He was hardly as
sprightly on his feet as on his last ap
pearance.
Carter had' the advantage of "Spider"
Kelly's coaching, which helped him ma
terially. With him were "Australian
Billy" Smith and Martin Murphy. They
sent him for Walcott's body at once and
each time the men came together Carter
ripped In either a right or a left that
carried a sting with it.
Walcott had Carter in dire distress at
the end of the third round. Carter kept
the point of his chin covered and barely
lasted out the round.
He came back in the fourth, but had
lost much of his steam. He devoted all
his attention to Walcott's body, while the
colored man kept swinging his right and
left to the head. Carter commenced bleed
ing from nose and mouth In the fifth. A
heavy blow to the body hurt Carter, but
he came back fast and there was a sharp
exchange just before the bell.
Before the fight many boxing celebrities
were introduced.. The popular "Kid" La
vlgne received the most cordial reception
from the spectators.
George Harding, the official timekeeper
for the club, said after the fight that Car
ter knocked his trainer, "Australian
Billy" Smith, out with the identical punch
he used on Walcott while boxing with him
recently at his training quarters. Smith
was confined to his bed for twenty-four
hours from the effects of the blow.
McFadden an Easy "Winner.
Kid McFadden and Joe Sullivan were
the first pair of boxers in the ring. The
Kid proved too strong for his lanky oppo
nent. . In the first round" Sullivan was
knocked down by a vicious left swing to
the jaw. He * took nine seconds on the
mat. In the second round Sullivan went
down three times. In the third he rushed
across the ring at the gong and pushed
the Kid back with a sharp jab to the
head. This aroused McFadden's fighting
blood and he hammered Sullivan all over
the ring, knocking him down three times.
The last time a right to the stomach sent
Sullivan writhing to the floor and his sec
onds threw up the sponge.
Cyclone Kelly and , Young Gibbs of
Cleveland furnished the second of the pre
liminary fights. Gibbs, who proved a fast
boxer and clever at in-fighting, went at
his man at once and punched him at will
He knocked him out in the seventh. To
ward the middle of the first round Kelly
woke up and took a lot of the steam out
of Gibbs with punches to the body. They
fought all over the ring In the second
round. Each showed, a cut mouth as one
result of the fierce exchanges. Each had
a lead at different times, and it seemed a
blow would end proceedings at any time.
Kelly took a lot of punching, but went
out to a left-hand hook to the jaw. It did
not seem a hard blow, but it required sev
eral minutes to bring him to.
VERDICT OB* CONVICTION
/IN NEATYTi CASE STANDS
The spectators crowded into the ring
and Captain of Police Wittman found it
necessary to draw his club before he
could clear the -people out of Walcotfs
corner. The latter was finally bundled
out of the ring by the police, a way being
forced for him through the crowd.
The talk of Walcott and his friends be
ing Implicated in a Job is not borne out
by. facts. All Walcott's followers had a
Walcott finally made a stand near the
ropes on the Larkin-street side of the
ring. It was here Carter delivered the
blow which won him the plaudits of the
spectators and the winner's share of the
purse. If Walcott was shamming to
avoid further punishment, he Is a con
summate actor, as those will attest who
watched the play of his features while
George Harding was relentlessly calling
off the fateful ten seconds.
The Pavilion was in a turmoil by
this time. The spectators were shrieking
at Walcott to get up and fight. When
the last moment of respite had passed the
men's seconds rushed into the ring. Wal
cott was at once examined by Dr. Eiden
muller, who reported he could detect no
sign of a foul blow.
| In the meantime Carter was beside him
'self with joy. He was bleeding from nose
and mouth, but ran around the ring shak
ing hands with his friends.
Contrary to all expectations when tfie
gong sounded it was a lamb that came
out of Walcott's corner, and not the lion
hearted fighter. When he had so decided

open for him but to pitch In and fight
Carter to a standstill. Carter was the
aggressor and chased. Walcott all around

quickly with another that they had the
effect of keeping the recipient on his
feet. It seemed if he had stopped for an
instant Carter would have fallen to the
floor. Â» Carter was bleed-ing from nose and
mouth, while his head rolled from side
to side as If it were held on by only
slender cords. When it seemed he must
go down Carter's gameness and vitality
kept him up. He rallied, and at the end
of the round he was fighting Walcott
back.
Carter was carried to his corner and
restoratives were applied. His seconds
worked over him in desperation to bring
him through in time to respond to the
call of time. .
Walcott has thus again furnished food
for endless discussion. There is material
aplenty on which arguments can be
based. To go back to the sixth round:
In this Carter was as nearly knocked out
as falls to the lot of any , boxer. When
the round opened he went after Walcott
at once, Jabbing him with his left and
sending his right to Walcott's head.
Walcott came back at him with some
short-arm blows to the head and then
whipped his right over, shaking up the
Kid considerably. He then caught Car
ter coming toward him and staggered
him.
The colored man was quick to see his
advantage and showered blows on Car
ter's head. He followed one blow "so

Others noted the end of the fight from
an entirely different point of view. They
did not hesitate to say Walcott quit when
he found his blows, which would fell an
ox, were not of sufficient power to stop
Carter. Among the men who hold this
view is Young Mitchell, Walcott's man
ager, and one of his seconds in the fight.
His first words when, asked his opinion,
before Walcott left the ring for his dress
ing room, were: "I saw no foul blow.- I
think Walcott quit."
Referee. Phil Wand said: "It was a fair
blow In the pit of the stomach."
Dr. William C. Eldenmuller, the surgeon
of the National Club, examined Walcott
for signs of a foul blow in, the groin, but
could find no injuries indicating that any
such blow had been received.
ty-five seconds of fighting. ; The
blow which brought the contest to an
abrupt and unexpected close was of ex
actly the same character as that with
which Fltzsimmons defeated Corbett in
their memorable battle at Carson. It was
a right hand blow, with a slight upward
tendency, to the pit of the stomach. ; Wal
cott sank to his knees, a look of. agony
on his face, while he clutched despairing
ly at his groin. His mind was active, but
all the nerves controlling the movements
of his body seemed suddenly disorganized,
leaving him helpless. All the powerful
machinery which had driven him through
six desperate rounds of fighting seemed
to have given out.
This is what the majority of spectators
saw.

Owner of the Yacnt Shamrock Is En
tertained in Chicago.
CHICAGO. Oct. 15.â At the Chicago Ath
letic Club to-nig-ht a banquet was given
in honor of Sir Thomas Upton and he
was also the recipient of a massive silver
loving cup presented by his friends in
Chicagro. For an hour prior to %Â»ie com
mencement of the banauet Sir Thomas
held a reception in the parlors of the
clubhouse, exchanging greetings with
hundreds of men prominent in financial
and professional circles, who called to
pay their respects to the owner of the
Shamrock. The rooms were hung with
flags of the international signal code and
many American and British emblems in
tertwined. Over the bead of the guest
of the evening as he stood exchanging
good wishes with the lone line of men
who called to meet him was hung an
enormous yellow nag, in the center of
which was a huge green shamrock.
The reception was over at 7 o'clock and
the banquet commenced a few minutes
after that hour. The decorations of the
banquet hall were of a strictly nautical
design, entwined with smilax, laurel and
evergreens. A model of the Shamrock II,
complete, with all sails set, was placed
in front of Sir Thomas. The presentation
of the loving cup was made the occasion
of a great demonstration, the guests ris
ing and cheering Sir Thomas again and
again.
Sir Thomas replied in a brief speech of
thanks for the honors that had been
ehown him In Chicago and alluded feel
ingly to the many kind messages he had
received from all parts of the country
since he arrived from the yacht races.
He said he was seriously considering mak-
Lig a third effort to win the America's
cup and his announcement was greeted
with cheers. He will remain in the city
for the remainder of the week and many
other entertainments will be given in his
honor, chief among which will be ban
quets by the Columbia Yacht Club and
the Bankers' Club.

When Sears had concluded his description of
the battle Raynor asked him if Commodore
Bchley had given him a diepatch to be pent to
the Navy Department making a report of the
battle. The witness replied in the affirmative.
Admiral Dewey then asked if this dispatch had
been sent and was informed by Raynor that it
had not been forwarded to the department, al-
Dispatch. Not Forwarded.
Looked Like Ramming.
"The second ship passed in the wake of the
first one and I said to the commodore that it
locked as if the second one was going to try
to ram us. He, I think, assented. At any
rate, the Brooklyn was held toward her and
the ' appeared to me to be uncertain In her
course. The Brooklyn was handled by the
captain and quartermaster. She turned after
Ehe had passed to the southward of the Te
iesa"s walte and follcwed her, and then it was
generally remarked on the tower bridge that
they were ail going to try and escape to the
westw ard.
â¢\u25a0Just about the time the Viscaya turned.
Teoman Ellis, who was a trained observer
with the stadiineter, canre to me on the plat
form and said that his stadimeter showed 900
yards to the Viscaya. I immediately took an
esp^ial look at the Viscaya with that in mind,
and my judgment confirmed the stadimeter. I
eaid to the commodore: "I think we are about
our tactical diameter from that 'ship now,' and
he raid 'I think so, too' or 'we are.' The
order was "hard aport.' I am not positive who
gave that order. I think the commodore said
â¢hard aport," and Captain Cook said 'it Is
hard aport-' The helm was kept hard aport
and the ship swung rapidly in her turning
circle. When the order was given 'hard aport'
I looked at the next vessel in our fleetâ the
Texas-^and in my Judgment we were com
pletely clear of her, and as we turned we
passed well clear of her. After the turn was
completed we found ourselves abreast or per
haps a little abaft the beam of the leading
Ppanish ship with a slowly converging course
toward the leading ship. It is my impression
we held a very straight course. The navigator
was trying to maintain this course to keep
our guns to bear to the best range. The Oregon
was astern of us and the Texas astern of her.
The Vlccaya began to blaze up and she turned
in ' toward shore. The commodore spoke of
the advisability of signaling through the Ore
iron to the Texas to stay by the Viscaya when
she turned In and insure her surrender, but
after a moment's thought he said: 'Philip will
know enough to look out for that.' and then
we proceeded. We were increasing our speed
as rapidly ae the fires could be forced, and
after the Viscaya had gone in we continued
the chase after the Colon. After we began
to gain upon the Colon the commodore directed
the Oregon, to try her guns at' her. Then the
Oregon and the Brooklyn fired deliberately at
the Colon. After our fire she began to waiver
in toward the shore. Her couree wae unset
tled and the commodore said he thought she
had enough cf It and was looking for a soft
spot to lie upon, which proved to be the case."
"As the ship swung toward the Teresa she
Fwung slowly around. To me the Teresa ap
peared not to hold an exactly steady coonse,
stnd the helm of our ship was eased one way
or the other to keep our ram pointing toward
the Teresa. The Teresa shortly turned square
ly toward the westward, and as she did so I
got a view of the next ship following in her
wake. It was my observation that the Brook
lyn was then held to meet the second ship
approaching. Of course we ported helm.
"I was In my room "when I heard the cry
cf the executive cScer, 'Clear ship for ac
tion'.' I knew what that meant and ran to
tha quarterdeck. I looked aloft to see if
tte prescribed eignal, "Enemy is escaping.'
was up. and saw that it \u25a0was. I met the com
modore on the quarterdeck. He directed the
signal to close in, all of. which were made.
Flora my position I l\ad a good view of the en
trance. Our ship was heading at the time,
I should say, to the westward^ of north, not
on her rogrular heading, which was about
northeast by north. The engines had been
Ftartec by the time I got on deck, and she
was gaining way and -was springing toward
the enemy. The first vessel, which proved to
be the flagship. Maria Teresa, came out. Sho
was uirt-ctly on our bearing irom the entrance
t o the port.
The witness described the engagement of
July S. After stating the preliminary inci
dents, he said:
The witness said the reconnoissance of May
SI. when ihe Colon was fired upon, developed
the etrength of the land batteries and they
l:ad proved to be stronger than he had sup
l-osed they were. Commodore Schley had, he
said, told him that his purpose was to ascer
tain what the batteries were. He said he had
been with Lieutenant Potts, on the MaÂ«n
cfcuFetts, on that day, and had not heard any
cor.vtrsation between that officer and Com
modore Schley.
\u25a0\Vith reference to the blockade at Santiago
the witness said that it had been maintained
at varying- distances of from three to six
miles. In thick weatter and at night the dis
tance was less than in fair weather and in

NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â A special to the
New York Journal from Washington
says: Friends of Secretary Root fear that
he -will not be able to resume his official
duties. They are in possession of certain
information from Root's physicians which
glve3 them much apprehension. He has
been sick a long time and there is no pros

sufficiently to return to Washington. It
is understood that the disability of which
Root is suffering: is of a cancerous nature
and does not lend itself to medical treat

that Assistant Secretary Sanger will suc

Meiklejohn's resignation.
SECRETARY ROOT'S ILLKESS
MAY CAUSE RETIREMENT
Hanna, who asked especially concerning the
meeting of the flying squadron with Captain
McCalla when the squadron was on Its way
to Cienfuegos, but the witness could .not re
call any conversation with' Commodore Schley
relative to that occurrence. Speaking of the
Adula the witness said the papers of that ves
sel were all right; he had looked Into that
matter himself.
Speaking of the arrival of the Hawk at Clen
fuegos with dispatches on May 23, witness re
ferred again to the McCalia memorandum,
which stated that there was a good landing
place thirteen miles from Cienfuegos, but he
said In reply to questions that no effort had
been made prior to the arrival of Captain Mc-
Calla, on the 24th, to find this landing place.
Continuing, tha witness .said that Instruc
tions -were given immediately â¢ after Captain
McCalla' s report that the Spaniards were not
at Cienfuegos to proceed to Santiago. He had
not heard that the commodore had other In
tentions than to leave forthwith and he knew
nothing of an alleged letter written on that
date by Commodore Schley, saying he would
not 'leave until the 25th, the. next day. The
witness, with reference to the alleged difllculty
of coalinz the Texas at sea, said that he had
had the authority of Captain Philip for that
statement.
Speaking- of the speed of the Brooklyn in
the chase of the Colon the. witness said it had
been increased gradually. The record made of
the revolutions of the engine showed that the
Brooklyn had covered forty-five mile3 on that
occasion. ' \u25a0" \u25a0 â
Hanna asked why the Yucatan Channel,
rather than the Windward Passage, had been
selected In making the retrograde movement.
The witness replied that his opinion was that
the selection had been 'made because of the
general feeling that the ships of the enemy
might have gotten out of the harbor at San
tiago and gone westward. In that event it
was felt that the Yucatan Channel route would'
be the better. The Impression that Cervera
had left Santiago, he said, had been created
by Information received from the Adula. but
he could not now recall just what that In
formation was. The witness aid that the fleet
under Commodore Schley never had been with
drawn from Santiago to a distance out at Eea
at night. As a rule the ships were farther in
side at night than during. the day. The ships
never had gone- farther off than six miles.
On one occasion the â¢ colliers had been sent
twenty-five miles away.
The court asked a number of questions of
the witness, which, with the answers, were
as follows:
"Were you present when Captain Cotton de
livered dispatches to Commodore Schley oft
Cienfue~os?" .
"I met the captain at the gangway, but
whether he gave the dispatches to the com
medore then I cannot say."
"If you heard those dispatches read, or read
them yourself, please state their purport."
"The dispatch he brought I think contained
the most positive information we had had that
the enemy were in Santiago. I remember that
dispatch as being the first information of any
posltlveness that we had had since leaving
Cienfuegos. I could identify the dispatch it 1
saw it."
The Signal of Orders.
"Did you hear any conversation that may
have taken place between Commodore Schley
and Captain Cotton? If so, please give it."
"I did not."
"Was any boat sent from the squadron to
examine the shore at Cienfuegos with the view
to ascertaining the practicability of landing?"
"Not to my knowledge."
"What orders, if any, were signaled to the
squadron by the Brooklyn from the time the
Spanish squadron appeared coming out until
the Colon ran ashore?" â¢â¢ - .\u25a0*\u25a0â¢=.
"The prescribed signal was that the Span
ish fleet was escaping. The next signal was
â¢Clear ship for action' ; the next signal was
'Close in." There was a signal when the Vis
caya was hopelessly out of "it for the Oregon
to cease firing. The next signal was to the
Oregon to open fire with 13-inch guns. There
were signals then made between the Oregon and
Brooklyn. When the Oregon would flre we
would notify her of the fall of her shells.
When we fired the Oregon notified us. Then,
upon the approach of the New York, when she
was observed, signal was made, I think, to
the Texas, to be repeated, notifying the commo
dore in chief that we had won a great vic
tory."
"Were these signals answered and these or
ders obeyed by the ships of the squadron?"
"The orders were obeyed. I do not know
whether the signals were answered or .not. I
could not see. Letter signals, those that had
nothing to do with the squadron" at the end
of the battle, were all answered."
"Was any examination of the coast, east and
west of Cienfuegos made with a view to find
ing a place where the Texas might be pro
tected from the sea while coaling?"
"No."
"Did you observe smoke in the harbor of
Cienfuegos? If so, describe it."
"I do not recollect any smoke at Cienfue
gos." . (
"What orders were issued by Commodore
Schley regarding the blockade of Cienfuegos?"
"I know of no orders."
"What signals were made to the flying squad
ron by Commodore Schley on May 31 regarding
the movement of the ships?"
"The range at which we were to fire was
signaled, as was the speed. I do not recollect
whether 'cease firing' was made or not." .
"Did the Teresa turn to the westward before
the Brooklyn commenced her turn to star
board?"
"The Brooklyn was forging ahead, gaining
speed, and as I stated in my recollection of
that event, the helm was eased. The Teresa
before she turned to westward appeared to
move herself to keep her ram toward us. It is
my Impression that Captain Cook kept our
vessel that way. The helm was only slightly
aport or eased up, and sometimes a little star
board. That was my observation. I did not
hear any orders. They were given out of my
hearing." *,
"Did you observe the turn .of the Brooklyn
though It had been taken to the cable office,
ihe court decided that as the dispatch had
net reached the department it could iiqJ up
'Suppose it was not commodore Schley's
fault that the dispatch was not forwarded?"
asked Raynor.
To this inquiry the court responded: "You
can't ask questions of the court. We are not
in the witness box. Commedore Schley' s re
port is in evidence and that is sufficient."
Itaynor questioned the witness again concern-
Ing his association with Lieutenant Commander
Potts, on the Massachusetts, and asked If ho
had heard the commodore say on the occasion
of the Colon reconnoissance anything in the
presence of Potts concerning the conspicuousness
of the uniforms of the otficers as they stood
on the turret during the firing of the enemy's
batteries. The witness replied In the negative.
In reply to a question, Commander Sears said
be had been with Commodore Schley In five en
pagements all told. He was then asked as to
the bearing of that officer under fire and re
plied :
"His bearing to me was a model for any
body, worthy of emulation at all times. Under
fire his laculties, if It was possible, seemed to
be clearer and he more in possession of them
than at any other time."
"Was he in any state of excitement?"
"Not the slightest."
In on them. I remember that distinctly be
cause 1 was anxious to keep a straight and
steady course, believing we gained by that,
and we had them at all times under an easy
range. We had the range completely and our
shots were landing. Theirs were not."
"Please state what was the conduct ana
bearing of Commodore Schley during the battle
of July 3. The anBwer to this question previ
ously given by you does not refer specifically,
to this date."
"1 cannot imagine any conduct in battle
more admirable. He was cool, brave and en
thusiastic Horn the beginning to the end of
the action."
Mr. Haynorâ Was Commodore Schley' s posi
tion on the Brooklyn on the day of the battle
one oÂ£ danger?"
"Yes, as much as any one on board.. He was
In the open all the time."
By the courtâ How tar was the Colon from
tha Brooklyn when the turn to starboard was
completed?
"'lAvo thousand yards or twenty-nve hundred
yards." â
Sears Again Heard. .
When the court concluded Its questions Cap
tain Cook withurew and Lieutenant Commander
Sears continued his recital of tne details of
the .Santiago campaign, being under cross ex
amination. The examination was conducted by
from the time the helm was put hard aport
until she headed to the westward on a course
parallel to that of the Spanish vessels?"
"I did."
"Did the Brooklyn turn steadily and rapidly
through all points or did she head longer on
some points than on others?"
"From the time the Vtscaya turned westward
nearer us than the Teresa the turn was com
plete'and the helm was not touched from my
observation. It was a complete turn" at the
speed we had." . /
"What were the relative positions of the Vis
caya and the Brooklyn when the Brooklyn
commenced her turn with ported helm?"
"As I Btated before, we were forging ahead,
gaining all the time, in that- direction, with
helm being eased and held aport and not hard
aport. The relative positions were 900 yards
apart."
Vessels Closed In.
"At what period of the action did the Viscaya
change her course, as ' if "^he intended to ram
the lirooklyn?" . .
"Shortly before she gave up. The fight had
developed into a very open one at that time."
"What were the relative positions of the
Colon and the Brooklyn when the Brooklyn
commenced to turn with port helm?"
"I had not seen the Colon."
"What were the relative positions of the
Brooklyn and the Colon when you discovered
that the Colon was 12,000 yards distant from
the Brooklyn?"
"She was well ahead of us, oft our starboard
bow. Inshore."
"At the time the Brooklyn turned to star
board, was her distance from the Texas more
or less than what is known as distance when
ships are in column?"
"It was not far from distance."
"You stated that the Brooklyn's position was
6000 yards southwest by west from the morro.
How long and at what speed had the Brooklyn
steamed when Ellis told you she was WjO yards
from one of the Spanish ships?" \u25a0 ,
"That would be a very bare estimate. I was
not watching that Just then."
"Was not' a signal made May 31 which stated
the object of the engagement on that day?"
"I do not recollect It.. There is a signal rec
ord book, where a careful record Is kept." '
"Have you, as flag lieutenant, any recollec
tion of the signal timed 11:20 a. m., Massachu
setts flagship to the squadron?"
The witness recalled such signal, which he
read as follows:
"The Massachusetts and New. Orleans and
Iowa will go In after dinner to a distance ot
7000 yards and flre at the Cristobal Colon, with
8. 12 and 13 Inch guns. Speed, ten knots."
-The Judge advocate â Do you know which of
the vessels on July 3 first hoisted the signal,
"Enemy escaping?" "; .
"I do not know of my own observation. Tha
report was the Iowa got it up first."
"That was the alarm signal to be hoisted,
not" aa an order, but as a general alarm or
warning to the fleet?"
â¢ "That was in the orders of the commander In
chief."
"With regard to clearing ship for action, to
which you refer, were not the ships practically
cleared for action all the time they were on
blockade?"
"Pi-actlcally; but there were some things left
to be done always."
"But It was not like clearing ship for action
under ordinary circumstances?"
"No."
"It does not appear before the court as evi
dence that there was a signal directing the
Oregon to open flre with 13-inch guns. Can you
point out where a record of that can be
found?"
"No, unless it is in the Brooklyn's signal
book. 1 ' â¢
"Can you state as. to the time this signal was
made, whether the Oregon had before that
time not used her 13-inch guns?" - â¢
"I cannot."
\u25a0 "Do you recollect the signal at 2:03 p. m.
on May 31 \u25a0 from the Massachusetts to tho
squadron, 4 Don't go in any closer?' "
"I do not recall that signal."'
"Do you know whether the Brooklyn crossed
the bow of the Texas?"
"She did not."
By. the court â Did the vessels close up July
3 in obedience to the -signal made from the
Brooklyn, : or was there a standing order for
them to â¢close up in case the enemy wa3 seen
attempting to escape?
"There was a standing order that If the ene
my attempted to escape, the squadron must
close In and destroy it, or words to that ef
fect."
When the court concluded its questions Com
mander Sears was excused and the court ad
journed for the day.
"Was he cool and calm?"
"Absolutely."
"How about points of dangerâ would he get
avray from them or did he eipose himself to
them?"
"He -was always putting himself In exposed
positions. I requested him many times not to
expose himself, as it was useless to do so."
Judge Advocate Lemly conducted the cross
examination of the witness, who said that Com
modore Schley had discussed the coal situa
tion freely with biro and that when the iretro
grade movement was begun the Texas had only
a little more than enough coal to carry her to
[ the nearest coaling station. He had, he said,
been averse to the westward movement, but
Raynor suggested that such a course of in
quiry would open the doors to a wide range of
questioning. He did not believe that the criticism
of a Junior officer, if made, should affect the
commodore. The witness continued by saying
that he had probably had as many as half a
dozen conversations with the commodoreÂ»con
cernlng the return, but he could not grlve the
particulars of these talks. He had, at Com
modore Schley*6 instance, made the signal for
the move westward.
Range Given for Firing.
Asked about the range given for the firing
of the American guns on May 31, Sears said he
had given it at 7000 yards under direction of
Commodore Schley. Asked if he had had any
conversation with Commodore Schley concern
ing that range, he replied in the negative.
"Did you not state otherwise In the ward
room of the Massachusetts ?*' Lemly asked.
"That question Is inadmissible," saFd Ad
miral Dewey, before the witness .could reply,
"unless Commodore Schley was present"
Captain Lemly and Hanna contended for the
admiaslbility of the question, and Raynor con
ceded that It was proper on cross-eacamlnation
for the purpose of impeaching the witness. The
court then allowed it to go in and Captain
Lemly asked it more specifically than before:
"I want to know if you did not state other
wise with regard to the range, in the ward
room of the Massachusetts on the day of the
action, on May 31, than you have stated here;
that is, you have stated here you have said
nothing about it."
"I have no recollection of stating anything
else," replied the witness. !
"Are you positive?"
"I am positive."
"Now, refresh your memory. I ask If you
did not say in the wardroom of the Massachu
setts: 'For God's sake, don't discourage him.
It Is all we have been able to do to work
him up to this," or worfia to that effect?*'
"Ko, I never said anything of the kind," re
plied the witness.
In reply to further questions the witness said
that while no conclusion could be reached
from the signal fires on shore, at Santiago on
July 2, tfc-at the Spanish fleet was preparing to
escape, yet the situation was so tense that
Commodore Schley felt something unusual
was going to occur. The court then took re
cess for luncheon.
Recall of Captain Cook.
The afternoon session began with the recall
of Captain Cook for the purpose of correcting
the testimony given by him yesterday. Judge
Advocate Lemly asked him the following ques
tion:
"What conversation. If any, did you have
with Commodore Schley about the retrograde
movement either before or after the signals
were made and the order given on May :26 to
return to Key West?"
"As nearly as I recollect the circumstances,
there was a conversation after the message
had been brought to me. and that the signal
had been made 'bound for Key West by Yuca
tan Channel.' I did not understand the signal
and went in to Â«ee the commodore about it.
I asked him what the signal meant and he
said that he must coal the ships, that he
rnust seek Borne place to coal them and that
he was going toward Key West until he could
find an opportunity to coal from the collier,
and if he did not find that he must be near
a coal base to keep the ships coaled. I made
rome remark concerning the weather condi
tions, that I thought that they would be more
favorable later. He replied: 'Until they are
and I am able to coal from the collier, I must
keep within striking distance of coal." I said
that I recognized that he felt the responsibility
as no one else could and that it was a serious
question. He answered that he recognized the
' fact but that he must act in accordance with
his 'judgment, whether right or wrong; that
1 personal consideration was of no account when
1 the safety of the fleet was to be considered.
\u25a0 That is about all I recollect."
! The court then asked the witness the follow
ing questions:
"What instructions did you receive from
! Commodore Schley regarding the movement of
1 the Brooklyn after it was discovered that Cer
vera's squadron was coming out of the har
bor of Santiago?"
"I do not recollect any specific Instructions.
I We were standing for the enemy."
1 "Please repeat any conversation that took
| place between Commodore Schley and yourself
from the time the Spanish squadron came out
until the Brooklyn was steadied on her westerly
course in chase."
"He several times spoke of the position of
the enemy. At one time he spoke of the turning
of one of the ships from the line. I saw
it, the Viscaya, I think, turn out and then
turn In again. He spoke of that. He said to
me at one time to look out for the torpedoes
or torpedo boats. I know at that time the
executive officer had come from below and I
turned to him and said: 'Look out for tor
pedo boats' or 'torpedo attack.' Then there
was the conversation as to putting the' helm
aport which I have already stated. He spoke
frequently to me during the action about cau
tioning the men at the batteries to fire steadily
and slowly, not to. lose their shots. He called
a number of times, loud enough to be heard in
the turret and to be heard on the lower deck
by the men manning the auxiliary batteries,
to fire steady, especially at a time when the
ships were doubled on each other, as for the
Instance the Colon from third to first place, in
side of the other ships. He spoke to me a
number of times asking me if I could not edge
WOMAN IS SUSPECTED
OP ACTHTG FOB BANDITS
Detectives in Tennessee Think They
Have Found an Accomplice
of Bobbers.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 15.â Annie
Rogers, alias Maude \u25a0Williams, aged 26
years is In the custody of the police here,
and General Superintendent Taylor of a
detective agency at Chicago, who is in
Nashville, believes her arrest will lead to
the apprehension of the gang which on
July 3 last held up a Great Northern ex
press train near Wagner, Mont^ securing
over $40,000 in bank notes. He hopes also
to recover much of the stolen money. A
large portion of the bank bills were un
signed by officials of the bank at Helena,
to which they were consigned.
The woman came under suspicion by her
actions at the Fourth National Bank
Monday afternoon, when she presented a
large roll of new bills of small denomina
tion asking for large bills in return.
Noting the bills closely, the teller became
suspicious, and while she was engaged in
conversation the police were notified.
When arrested the woman refused to
make any explanation of where the $550
in her possession came from. The bills
were on the Helena . bank, and though
slimed the serial numbers coincide with
thoÂ«e given In a circular advertisement
of the robbery. A warrant was sworn out
against the woman, charging her with at- (
tempting to pass forged bank notes. she
declined to tell of herself further than
to assert that she was born in Texas and
that she arrived here Sunday night, from
where she will not say.

"Forced to It again, I determined to see
if it could not v be made palatable and
found at once that when I followed di-
rections and boiled It long enough, that I
not only liked it but gave It to my hus-
band for several days without his finding
It out. I have the name of making-
splendid coffee, and we always used the
best, but of late I have given Postum to
guests many times In place of coffee and
have never been detected yet-
"Our four children have not drank cof-
fee for three years, and all have gained
health and flesh since using Postutn.
One son, who was always sick, has been
greatly benefited by Us use, and as above
stated, I have gained twenty-flve pounds
elr.ee taking up Postum. I am healthier to-
day than I have been for years and give
Postum all the credit. Please do not use
my nime in public."
"I bad become very thin In flesh and
suffered tortures with heartburn, was a
nej-vous wreck with headache practically
all the time until one dreadful day when
the gtjod doctor told me I must quit
drinking 1 coffee, as he had nothing left to
try to relieve me.
\u25a0"I could not drink tea and had tried
everything else, even Pcstum, but put it
by at the first trial, because It was taste-

Continued on Page Thirteen,
CHICAGO, Oct. ' 15.â A ' moderate firmness
underlaid the wheat market, though It ruled
dull and narrow.' The best demand was in the
first half hour of business, when, under the
Influence of better Liverpool cables and de
creased Northwestern receipts, December sold
Vi@%c higher at 70%@70%c. This caused ' a
lresh awakening of the bullish spirit. that had
waned at the close yesterday. The advance,
however, enticed sellers' and December sagged
early to 70%c. Later there was news of some
fair exports and shorts covered until December
touched 71c. Then the market turned pro
foundly dull and wheat bought early began to
Chicago Grain Market.
Dlles of both, including the withdrawals from
cold storage, are ample for the demand. Cheese
stands the same as for several â¢eks.
Receipts were 16.000 pounds of Butter. â â

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Peaches are doing better. There Is now some
ecld-storase stock on the market. Plums, on
the contrary, are out of favor. The cooler
weather is operating against Melons, and they
are weak. Grapes are firmer under a good
demand. Choice Apples continue in light sup
ply, but there is a good deal of wormy stocK
lying around. _i_.j
Wine Grapes are lower, as receipts are mixed
with the second crop, which is deficient in

LONDON. Oct. 15.â Consols. 83 7-16;, Silver,
NBW YORK. Oct. 15. â The movement of
prices _in to-day's stock market lacked coher
ency at all times. Opening weakness gave way
to a period of Btrength, which was met by
profit-taking, and the resulting reaction i was'
vigorously contested by aggressive manipula
tion of , Pennsylvania. The whole market fin
ally gave way to a weakness and closed at a
level lower than yesterday, net losses reaching
a point or ever In some -of the leading stocks.
The gnly aggressive force for a rise in the mar
ket was what might be called the formal invi
tation, issued by the arch-manipulator in the
Etreet, to the public to follow his leadership
in a speculation for a rise, with a suggestive
glance toward Southern Pacific as an available
market leader. This invitation made its ap
pearance in, circular form yesterday, with an
appropriate demonstration in the market fo
herald it. As the author has been associated in
the Wall-street mind with the organized sup
port of the United States Steel stocks, those
stocks shared in yesterday's demonstration, but
the sequence to-day was less convincing. South
ern Pacific, indeed, started off with a flurry,
and St. Paul made a preliminary advance of
IVi. Other stocks to respond were few and the
obvious fact that heavy realizing was going on
in the Pacific group of stocks and St. Paul
served still further to disincline the public to
accept the invitation to speculate. A move
ment in Pennsylvania which developed later,
and which carried the stock up 2 points, was
nominally based upon the heavy traffic move
ment over the company's lines, but the remem
brance of old associations of the author of the
invitation referred to with market movements
of this stock aroused a suspicion of a possible
connection en his part with the movement.
The buying was congested, but so also was the
selling, one brokerage house being credited
with sales of 20,000 shares. The last price of
the stock showed only a fractional remnant of
the extreme advance. Last week's enthusiasm
over the alleged plan of a proprietary company
to hold control of Great Northern preferred.
Northern Pacific, Burlington and the "release
of large amounts of tied-up capital" has en
tirely evaporated, as the release of this capital
is seen to be contingent upon the investing
public taking the minority portion of the pro
jected new company off the hands of the pro
jectors. The renewed heavy demand for cur
rency from the cotton centers was a disturb
ing factor in the late trading. There were
transfers through the Sub-Treasury of $500,000
to New Orleans and of .Â£300,000 to St. Louis. On
the other hand a rise in exchange at Chicago
to 10c premium marked the cessation of the
demand from that quarter. There were no pay
ments for bonds by the Sub-Treasury to-day,
the belated settlement of that account having
apparently been completed, and the Government
institution has withdrawn $1,500,000 from the
market since Friday. The downward tendency
in sterling exchange was checked and London
was a seller of stocks in th'.s market. There
was a somewhat feverish speculation in Amal
gamated Copper, which lifted the stock over a
point, then drove it down 3 points and left it
with a net loss of y*. Total sales, 717,100 shares
Railroad bonds were quite active and gener
ally firm. Total sales, par value $2,710 COO
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

WHEAT FREIGTHS-The spot market is
quiet and easy at about 36s 3d, usual options.
The chartered wheat fleet in port ' has a regis
tered tonnage of 74,868, against 40,594 tons on
the same date last year; disengaged, 15,26-Mons,
against 1608; on the way to this port, 205,792
tons, against 146,000.
"WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris futures were
both higher. Broomhall cabled that the Indian
and Argentine crop advices were more unfavor
able. Further rains are needed in the Argen
tine, and the present outlook is for a yield 25
per cent less than last year, notwithstanding
the increased acreage. Another authority,
however, wires from.Rosarla, saying that there
has been no actual damage In that province,
and that the weather has turned cooler, with
indications of rain. Bradstreet's reported the
world's visible supply as follows: East of the
Rockies, an increase of 1,937,000 bushels; Eu
rope and afloat, a decrease of 400,000; net in
crease, 1,537,000 bushels.
Chicago was firmer on the better foreign ad
vices, and the market was active, but holders
sold freely. St. Louis exporters reported an
increase in the bids from Germany.
This market was steady on the spot, and
somewhat firmer in futures. â¢

London Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The Etock market to-day was quiet, but was
encouraged by the war news, particularly the
I rumor that General Botha had been captured,
! although the report is apparently unfounded:
Investment issues were in demand on cheap
money conditions, although Paris exchange re
mains at 25.12. which is near the gold im
port Doint. Austria is still a keen buyer of
the metal, and this is also the season when
New York takes cold.
American stocks were more- active, closing
at the top on New York support. London
i would like to put the market up, but is afraid
j to take the initiative. Your correspondent is
privately informed that the steel syndicate
finished unloading last week.
Money on call ruled steady and discounts
are 2% on the low Paris exchange rate and
the sale of Â£180,000 in gold coin. The Bank of
England has engaeed Â£10,000 gold in South
America.
The White Star line gives unqualified contra
diction of the renewed rumor thaf Morgan
interests are acquiring control.

Tobin won great applause from his
hearers when he declared in forcible terms
that he had accepted the nomination with
out pledging himself to any one, and that
lie was and would always be without tie
to any man or set of men. He promised
that if elected he would perform the du
ties of t!}3 office in an upright and honest
manner and to the best of his ability.
Tobin concluded his remarks by saying
that he \u25a0would not discuss the issues of
the campaign at the meeting, deeming the
district meetings the proper places for
their discussion.
The temporary officers were made per
manent, and on motion it was decided to
have the chair appoint eighteen gentlemen
from, the various districts to work with

Cormick was selected as secretary. Dr.
Joseph Calegaris, former Chief of Police
Patrick Crowley, F. E. Hesthal. Albert S.
Wieland and B. P. Oliver were selected as
vice presidents.
When Tobin was called upon for a
Bpeech he said he had not come to the
meeting for that purpose, but to thank
his friends and the Democrats of the city
for the honor they had conferred upon
him. He said it was both a pleasure and
an honor to be nominated for Mayor by
the Democratic party, and he was pleased
to receive the indorsement of his friends.
He added that it had not been hi3 inten
tion to accept the nomination on account
of private reasons, but he agreed to make
tne sacrifice as an honest and patriotic
citizen.
The Joseph S. Tobln Club was organized
last night at 909 Market street. It was an

Angry Crowd Shouts. "Fake,"
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 15.â Clarence Ritchie of
St. Louis won en a foul from Oscar Gard
ner, the Omaha "Kid," to-night in the
third round of what was to have been a
fifteen-round bout before the Olympic Ath
letic Club. The go saemed as palpable a
fake as was ever pulled off in a ring and
the crowd had been worked into a rage
long before the culmination of hostilities.
They yelled for their money back and
when it was not forthcoming left the hall
in high dudgeon.. . .
"If we lose our case in the Supreme
Court it will mean that the county gov
ernment act is unconstitutional," said J.
H. \V. Riley, one of the official court re
porters. "District Attorney Allen has at
tacked the act not only as regards our
salary provision, but by the title aa well.
This ia along the lines of the code der
cision as I understand it."
The court reporters' case at issue in
volves the question of the legality of the
act wherein it provides a salary for court
reporters and fees. Upon the advice of
District Attorney Allen County Auditor
Bwlng refused to draw the salary war
rants, the District Attorney declaring
that not only was this provision illegal,
but 'that the whole act itself was void.
The reporters mandamused Ewing, but
Judge Hall, sitting with the other Judges,
decided that the act, so far as it related
to the salary provision, was illegal in that
it was a special act of legislation.
The reporters found that in Los An
geles County the court had sustained the
act and had declared that so far as. the
title was concerned, the salary provision
did not have to be embraced in it. This
decision was exactly contrary to the Ala
meda County ruling, so to settle the law
the reporters here decided to appeal.
Briefs on appeal have been prepared and
will shortly be submitted to District At
torney Allen for his reply. Then they will
be filed with the Supreme Court.
But the old county government act
which would be operative provides that
counties of 100,000 population should be In
the second class, and this puts Los An
geles and Alameda counties, under the
new census, on an equal footing.
The Legislature also made many other
changes in classification, leaving the del
egations from each of the large counties
free to adjust the patronage otnees to the
demands of the interested county.
Alameda County, under this condition of
affairs, will be thrown into the same class
\u25a0with Los Angeles County. Without a new
classification the incoming officers of 1903
will find themselves able to appoint a
host of deputies and increase tho patron
age to the high mark of the Southern
California county. The Sheriff would be
assisted by nineteen deputies under pay.
The County Clerk's roster would run to
seventeen assistants, and so on. along the
line. It was to avoid this very condition
that the last legislature reclaesifled Ala
meda County by changing the population
limits to classes and threw this county
into the third class.
The politicians of the State have their
eyes upon the move which is being made
in Alaineda County to secure a Supreme
Court decision upon the validity of the
present county government act. The
question is shortly to be brought into that
court upon an appeal from the Superior
Court of this county from the decision in
what Is known as the "court reporters'
salary case." If District Attorney Allen's
contentions be upheld by the Supreme
Court the entire county government act
will be nullified, for he has attacked it
aa defective in title, using what is said to
be analagous argument to that by which
the codes decision was given, declaring
tht? new codes unconstitutional.
Should the Supreme Court decide
against the county government act as it
has against the codes, thirty-two counties
of California will be thrown back to the
classification of the act of 1S98, unless a
special session of the Legislature shall
be called before the elections of 1902 are
held. â¢

Mrs. Susan Levy has recovered her four
year-old daughter, who was abducted Sun
day night by the child's father, Daniel
Levy, from the home of its grandparents,
Mr. and Mrs. H. M. Harrington of 803
Twelfth street.
Alone and unaided the mother went in
pursuit of her missing baby to-day and
located the little one near me Presidio in
ban l'Tanctaco, where the father is sta
tioned as a soldier of the Twenty-ninth
Infantry, U. S. A. Mrs. Levy tried to se
cure the assistance of the local police In
the search, but was informed that under
present conditions the father was as much
entitled to possession of the child as her
self. Nothing daunted by this plain ex
planation of the legal side of the case, the
mother decided to go upon the trail her
self and if possible to find the hiding place
of her little girl. . Realizing that her hus
band would undoubtedly put their daugh
ter within easy access of his abode, Mrs.
Levy hastened 'at once to the Presidio.
After wandering for hours about the
Government grounds and becoming nearly
exhausted by her long search the mother
was about to surrender, when she sudden
ly espied tho figure of a child clad in a red
automobile coat. The mother recognized
the coat as the wearer disappeared in the
doorway of a house. Lying in wait for a
favorable moment Mrs. Levy, nervous and
excited, saw her opportunity, slipped into
the place, got her child and fled for a
street car. Hastening back to Oakland,
the mother and her child were soon safe
in the harrinsrton residence. She returned
this evening with her daughter to Ber.i
cia, Mrs. levy's home.
Further contest for the custody of the
daughter must be made there, for the
mother says she will make application to
the court for control over her child, pend
ing the settlement of the divorce suit she
has brought against her husband.
Levy declares that the only reason he
desired to remove his daughter was be
cause the child was not In proper sur
roundings.

ent of the Poineer says: The late Ameer
was paralyzed on the right side during
the third week of September. His illness
was kept a secret at the palace. Finally,
on September 28. feeling that he was dy

citizens, together with all hia sons except
the youngest, and addresesd them In a
feeble voice, inviting them to say who
they considered should succeed him.
In tears the listeners declared tor Habib
Ullah. The Ameer thereupon directed
that his swerd and Jeweled belt be given
to Habib Ullah, together with a larjr<s
volume, supposed to be his last -will and
instructions regarding the management of
the state. He then ordered the younger
son to place the crown. upon the head of

FORT SCOTT, Kans., Oct. 15.â An at
tempt was made here early this morning
to wreck the Missouri, Kansas and Texas
fast train. A piece of casting was driven
into a frog switch in such a manner as
to derail the train if it had been proing
rapidly. Fortunately the engineer had
slowed down on nearing the crossing and
no injury was done to the train. Officers
are looking for the would-be wreckers.

The report closes with a tribute to the
late President and praises the qualifica

ley's successor.
"Shame! Shame!" cried the 300 preach
ers, as the rea.ling was finished. Contin
uing, the Bishop said: "This 13 high trea
son. There should be a law under which
the publisher who printed this could be
arrested at once. You remember the Hay
market massacre. The night it occured
Mayor Carter H. Harrison was down
there. He rode away saying. 'There'll bo
no trouble.' Two hours later severnl men
were stretchd out dead or in agony. HÂ»
was mistaken. This anarchistic taik does
cause harm. Let us produce a public
opinion which shall make such utterances
treason."
The subject of anarchism was brought
up by the report of the committee on tha
state of the country, which the Rev. J.
R. Creighton presented. The committee
recommended that laws be passed "to
protect the lives of public officials and UÂ»
make any attempt against the stability of
our Government an act of treason, to be
punished as such."
CHICAGO. Oct. 15,- Anarchy and yel
low journalism, placed together as ihÂ«
curses of the natiriTi, were condemned lvt
strongest terms to-day by the Rock River
Methodist Conference at Evanston. ami
every member present voted against tbe*eÂ»
enemies of. law and promised to us* hist
eloquence and influence to destroy both.
Bishop McCabe commended the tem
perance committee's report as the best
he had ever hÂ»ard, and he condemned yel
low journalism as the brother of anarch
ism. In support of his charge he quoted
from the San Francisco Examiner th*
stanza printed February 4, 1300. and run
ning as follows:
The bullet that pierced Qocbsl's breast
Cannot be found in all the West.
G-ood reason: It is speeding: here
To stretch McXinley on his bier.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The woods and all roads in the neigh
borhood have been placed under guard
and It is expected that the men will be*
captured. During the flight a buggy In
which two of the crooks were riding broke
down and they were forced to abandon It,
riding away on the horses. In tho buggy
was found a large quantity of chickens,
potatoes and edibles of various kinds,
which is taken to indicate that the gang
intended to hide themselves in the woods
somewhere and camp out until the ex
citement subsided. At least one of the
robbers wa3 wounded in the fight. Banker
Wolfe says that little of value was se
cured.
Tiie cracksmen used nitroglycerin.
The doors of the vault were blown com
pletely off and the building was partially
demolished. The terrific explosion awoke
the people of the town. All who ap
proached the bank, however, were driven
away by tho robbers, who were armed
with rifles. Mayor McConnell attempted
to enter the bank, but was fired upon by
the robbers and compelled to retreat.
Having secured their booty, the cracks
men went to a livery stable, where they
bound and gagged the owner. They then
took several rigs and drove rapidly away.
A posse and bloodhounds are on the trail
of the robbers.
MASON CITY, Iowa, Oct. 15.â The safe
of the bank at Rudd v/as blown onen by
dynamito last night. The robbers
escaped on a handcar and took to the
woods. ' The president of the bank stated
that the amount secured was about $3000.
MOUNT VEBNON, Ohio. Oct. 15.â The
vault of the bank at Danville, Ohio, was
blown open early to-day by a gang of
eight robbers. Five charges of dynamite
were used and the bank building as well
as the vault were wrecked. The explo
sions aroused the citizens and a pitched
battle took place, during which the
thieves took night. They were followed
to Buckeye City, where they had rigs in
readiness, and drove away. Pursuit was
at once taken up and a number of shots
were exchanged until Adrian's woods
were reached, where the vehicles were
abandoned by the robbers, who sought
cover. .
GALJOIf. Ohio, Oct. 15.â The vault of
the Fanners' and Citizens' Bank at Tyro,
a small town near here, was wrecked
early to-day by six robbers, who secured
the contents and escaped. It is said the
vault contained $40,000.
After the singing of "Nearer, My God,
to Thee," by the Elks' Quartet the lodge
ritual was taken up. When this was com
pleted Congressman Julius Kahn rose to
deliver the address. He had known Thall
for many years, was one of his close
friends and his tribute to the character of
the departed drew tears from man and
woman. He spoke of Thall's early strug
gles, his later successes and his kind
deeds. When Congressman Kahn con
cluded with: "We will never see him again,
but we will always bear in our hearts^ the
memory of Mark Thall," the tears were
wiped away from many a cheek.
The ceremonies concluded with the plac
ing of the ivy on the casket of the dead
and the singing of "Good Night, Good
Night, "Tis Morning Now."
The body was then carried to the hearse
and the funeral procession begun. A band
of fiftv pieces playing Chopin's "Funeral
March" preceded the Theatrical Me
chanics* Association. Then came the Elks
and the mourners in carriages. The march
was down Sutter street to Kearny, then
along Third to Howard, where the so
cieties halted arid the funeral carriages
continued their course to the cemetery.
Rabbi Nieto spoke again at the grave
side and all that was earthly of Mark
Thall was buried. The memory of his
goodness, his kindness and his charity wil?
remain.
Congressman Kahn Pays Tribute.
The exalted ruler, Thomas B. Dunne,
then began the services. After the ritual
prayer .by the chaplain the secretary was
directed to call the name of the departed
member. Three times in the solemn still
ness the name was called aloud, only to
be followed by the sobbing and weeping
cf the family.
To the mournful notes of Chopin's
"Funeral March" the casket was carried
into the halL As soon as the family of
the deceased was seated and the lodge
members had taken their places the re
maining seats were rapidly filled. A very
small fraction of those who wished to at
tend the ceremonies could be accommo
dated.

of that Impressive character that lingers
on the mind, just as will the warmth of
heart and the kindly charity of Mark
Thall himself remain In the memories cf
his many friend?.
Mark Thall had thousands of friends
and it is they who feel the sad loss almost
as poignantly as do his family. From the
far Kast and the South came ordered flor
al tributes. Four wagons closely packed
with flowers attested the love and respect
In v.hich the deceased was held. Behind
his coffin scores and scores of bowed men
and sorrowing women walked, sincere in
their grief and burdened with sadness.
Following the Jewish funeral ceremonial
rites Rabbi Nieto spoke with much feeling
over the cotnn as it lay in the homo of
Thall's friends, Fred Belasco and M. E.
Mayer, at 353 Geary street. More than
one hundred of the San Francisco Lodge
of Theatrical Mechanics' Association, a
full representation of the Theatrical Man
agers' Association, a large number cf
Klk-3, people of the stage and friends old
and new gathered to attend the funeral
ceremonies. The four wagons in the
street with the floral burdens, the many
carnages and the crowds on the side
walk almost blocked traffic. Not one
fourth of those who came in the early
mornins hours to show their last devo
tions of friendship could enter the house.

The worthy grand matron in her report
enriourieed that during the year she paid
fifty-five official visits to chapters. Ben
jamin A. Plant -visited four chapters in
the State of Xevada. The grand matron
recommends, in view of the fact that it
is impossible to vi^it all the chapters dur
ir.s" a term, that the jurisdiction be di
vided Into districts, ten in number, and
that a grand instructor be appointed for
each district: that charters be granted to
thote chapters now under dispensation
â¢which give evidence of ability to do the
v.-ork and a willingness to conform to the
laws and regulations, and that a memo
rial page be set apart in the proceedings
in memory of Past Grand Matron Mary
J. Parker, who died during the year. In
her report she pays a plowing tribute to

clopedia of statistics, and her willingness to
assist everybody -who may be in need of help
renders her services indispensable.
The grand patron congratulated the or
der on the. growth it made during the
year and recommended that the uniform
codo be amended to require by-laws to
be Eigned sixty days alter initiation or
affiliation or membership be forfeited, and
that a section be added to the* constitu

p-yf 1^ KE Chamber of Commerce, at ita
9 quarterly meeting held yesterday,
| decided to maintain a rcpresenta
16 tive permanently at "Washington
to look out for the commercial In
terests of San Francisco. William M.
Bunker has been selected for the position
and will leave for his new post at an early
date.
The matter is one which has been a sub
ject of debate among the prominent men
of this city for several months. San Diego
on the south and Seattle on the north both
have representatives at the national capi
tal and their labors have been crowned
with beneficial results. That San Fran
j cisco should likewise be provided for has
j been long admitted, but there ha$ pre-
I viously seemed no way in which the nec
i essary expenses might be met. Now the
Chamber of Commerce has determined to
pay for everything out of Its own treas
' ury without the assistance of the other
commercial organizations of the city.
I Senator Perkins was present at th8
meeting yesterday and strongly advised
that the action be taken. He stated that
he himself and the other members of the
delegation were always ready to assist
by whatever means should bÂ© in their
: power in furthering the interests of San
Francisco, but that a man who was con
stantly in touch with commercial inter
ests on the coast could present matters
for legislation to the delegates in a much
better way than could be done by postal or
telegraphic communication, which has up
to this time been the way in which im
portant matters have been dealt with.
Mr. Bunker has for a long time been ac
tive in the interests of the Chamber of
Commerce and in choosing: him for the
new nest commercial men feel that they
havo* secured the services of an efficient
worker.
Th'3 membership committee made a very
exhaustive report of Its labors yesterday.
It wa3 shown that the organization has
mere members now than at any other
time in its history. Many new firms havo
been admitted during the last two months
and the total membership is now 520. The
activity and earnestness of Secretary
Scott were especially commended.
The Chamber of Commerce Is now on a
solid working basis and its members are

Presented With a Watch.
Joseph Beck, treasurer of the Macca

â¢watch by his fellow members last night.
The presentation speech was made by
Wallace Wise and was feelingly responded
to by Beck. Congratulatory remarks were
made by several other members.
The conclusion above reached has been up
held by Judge Murasky in the recent , case of
MorrlEsey vs. the Board ' of ' Education, which
directly involved the validity of the anti-mar
riage rule herein considered. It was Judge
Murasky's opinion also that such rule was be
yond the power of the board.
There Is another basis for the . same . conclu
sion. ' The law prescribes the condition upon
which one may secure a teacher's certificate.
These conditions being complied with,. a certifi
cate Issues which entitles the holder to teach.
The board has discretionary power to say who
shall be appointed, but it cannot make a rule
denying married women who have proper cer
tificates the right to teach in the schools and
upon such ground base- their refusal. The
board, cannot add to the conditions Imposed by
law. If the board 'cannot I add to the legal
requirements for admission to the service as a
teacher it cannot add to the conditions under
which it. may dismiss from such service/
City and County Attorney Lane ren
dered an opinion yesterday that makes
nugatory a rule of the Board of Educa
tion which provides that whenever a fe
male teacher marries her position thereby
becomes vacant. Lane advises that it is
not in the jurisdiction of the board to
interfere in the private affairs of em
ployes in the School Department. The
opinion says:
When a teacher is "elected" to the depart
ment it cannot be said that any particular or
express regulations or rules constitute part of
the "contract" of employment. Teachers may
be employed by an express contract or may. bo
elected. An elected teacher cannot, therefore,
be said to be bound "by contract" to observe
the rules of the board. It does not follow,
iiowever, that, because not bound by express
contract to observe. the rules of the department
a teacher so elected may disregard them. On
the contrary, all teachers, whatever the terms
or forms of their employment, are .under an
Implied obligation, which is binding and" en
forceable, to comply with all lawful rules and
regulations of the board. But the rule com
pelling the retirement of female teachers upon
marriage is not in my opinion a valid rule 'of
the department. In an opinion dated August
16, 1900, on the subject I wrote: ' \u25a0â¢
The board > has power to I makes rules
regulating the department, prescribing hours of
attendance, the character of the work to . be
performed and such other rules as will tend
to bring the department under good system
and discipline, but it cannot; make a rule that
a teacher's position shall become vacant when
she marries, because her marriage, is not a
matter of School Department business. '
Judge dc Haven ordered an adjourn
ment until 10 o'clock this morning, by

The prosecution had blundered also, he

OF AIXEGED BI^TJUDESS
Wong Hi, a Chinese 1 undertaker, en
gaged Beeler and Sam Sherman, idle ha
bitues of Chinatown, to take the body of
the babv to the cemetery in San Mateo
County. Beeler was paid $2 25 for the
prospective services and, with burial li
cense, started out Monday afternoon with
the coffln. Sherman and Beeler were none
too sober at the, time of starting. When
they reached Colma they tired of their
job and after going a short distance far
ther they threw the coffln over a fence
and returned to town. Beeler confessed
to his Inhuman action, alleging drunken
ness as the reason. Sherman has not yet
been arrested, but Ryan expects to cap
ture him to-day.
The Chinese baby was two months old.
The body was removed to Redwood City.
Beeler will be taken there also and held
to answer for a violation of a burial ordi
nance.
A small coffin containing the corpse of
a Chinese baby was discovered yesterday
morning about a quarter of a mile below
Colma. The dogs of the neighborhood
vfrere gnawing through the thin boards
trying to reach the body. Two farmers
in the vicinity found the coffin and re
ported the case to the Constable at Col
ma. Information of the discovery was
sent to the local Police Department and
Detective Tom Ryan was put on the case.
Harry Beeler was arrested after an in
vestigation and confessed to the facts
which account for the presence of the
body near the Colma road.
The Judge thereupon ordered the de
fendants arraigned, despite Hutton's ob
jection, and continued the cases till next
Monday morning at 11 o'clock, when the
preliminary examination will take place.
The defendants with the exception of
Duncan seem to realize the gravity of
the charge against them. Duncan grinned
at every one >vho looked in his direction
and appeared to feel a certain pride in
the notoriety attached to the horrible
crime. â¢ â¢ .
Hutton objected strenuously to any tes
timony being taken, and insisted upon the
continuance. The Judge called Piatt to
the stand and questioned him as to his
arrangements for leaving the city. He
replied that he wanted to get away -as
soon as he could, but- a day or two
would not make any difference.
William Buckley, Thomas Moran,
Charles r>onnelly and Edward Duncan,
the four men charged with the murder of
George W. Rice, the non-union machin
ist, at Twentieth and Howard streets Fri
day evening, appeared before Judge Mo
gan yesterday. Benjamin Rice, a brother
of the murdered man, swore to complaints
before the cases were called charging
each of the defendants with murder.
When the cases were called Attorney
Hutton explained that he was associated
with Attorney Cleveland L. Dam as coun
sel for Buckley. He asked, in
view of the fact that it would require
some time to ' transcribe the testimony
taken at the Coroner's inquest, that a
continuance be granted for a week. Jo
seph Coffey, who appeared as special pros
ecutor, said that W. J. Piatt and his
daughter Erline. \u25a0who are important wit
nesses, had made arrangements to leave
the city on an extended vacation; and if
the defense would agree to their testi
mony being taken he would not object to
the week's continuance. .

The other candidates who were upon .the
stage were called upon to state their posi
tions in reference to the management of
the offices they are seeking to fill.
Is this the kind of Mayor the citizens of San
Francisco desire? Do they want the bosses
on the one hand to have control of all the
municipal officers, and the railroad, water,
gas and other corporations to engineer all the
legislation? If I can Judge the temper of the
people they certainly do not.
On the other hand, our present Mayor is the
owner of millions, of which he never earned a
dollar by work. The present Democratic nom
inee Is also, I am informed, the owner of a
large fortune by Inheritance, which enables
him to move in society and to maintain the
dignity of his position. Do not misunderstand
me â money Is not an objection. The mere fact
of Its possession Is no sin and no disqualifica
tion and of Itself is no argument against hold
ing of office, and what I say la not an attack
on wealth. Inherited or earned. I mean merely
that its possession should not seemingly be
the only qualification for office. I mean merely
that there lies ever in the constant and re
currlns: nomination of such centlemen, whose
greatest qualification Is their prominent finan
cial standln* (and they have been nominated
for years and years), an implied accusation
against the honest masses of the people â an
imputation of unreliability, irresponsibility, ig
norance, dishonesty or of viceâ an imputation
which is sometimes, indeed, not carried silently
but is often ooenly expressed. I maintain
that such a situation is not fair or conducive
to' the best interests of a community.
Possession of Money Not a Sin.
Why should we be called upon always to fol
low and never. I will not say to lead, but Â«ot
even to be on an equal footlnsr In governmental
affairs? Why should the Mayor, for example,
be sought always among the representatives
of moneyed interests, the owners of Inherited
fortunes or the willing coadjutors of the rep
resentatives and attorneys of the giant corpo
rations? The candidate for Mayor of the Re
publican conventionâ I will not say of the Re
publican party, because the party had nothing
to do with his nomination and a large portion
of the party Is extremely dissatisfied with it
has himself openly avowed that he owes his
nomination to a syndicate of Impure political
bosses and to the influence of the representa
tives of the irreat corporations, which need a
stanch friend in the Mayor's chair to enable
them better to carry out their selfish policies.
He has himself lately stated through the
public press that for the settlement of a very
trifling political question he sent one of the
petty bosses to the chief counsel of the rail
road company, and It is currently reported that
his entire administration, both as to appoint
ments and as to policies, is mortgaged politi
cally in advance to fulfill his obligation in
curred on receiving the nomination.
Now, does any one for a moment doubt that
If. instead of the gentleman who is now filling
the Mayor's chair, we had had some one as
Mayor of San Francisco who had been brought
up In touch with the masses of the people, 'who
had earned his own living, who could sympa
thize with the situation, that all the troubles
and violence, exaggerated though they may be,
inexcusable though they may be, could have
been avoided?
Let us for example take boldly the late in
dustrial disturbances in our city, the echoes
of which are still reverberating.
I deprecate and have tver deprecated all vio
lence. In accepting tne nomination for the
office of Mayor, I said and I repeat now firm
ly and deliberately, "that I am in favor of
peaceful measures at all hazards and In the
fair and friendly consideration of invested cap
ital as corelatlve to similar consideration for
organized labor."
Schmitz Deprecates Violence.
loyal support depends the safety of the coun
try and the happiness of our people, but when
a crisis arrives, when there ia need for the
exercise of a calm, cool Judgment and a com
mon sense born of experience \u25a0with the world
and contact with fellowmen of all classes, do
we find that representation in government to
which our numbers, our intelligence, our re
spectability entitle us? No. No, indeed.

bearer in this contest, of course I desire, and
I expect, to meet with successful result, and
I shall certainly do all in my power, in every
honorable way, to secure my election. But
principles must overshadow and outweigh men,
and the personality of candidates, while merit
ing most careful consideration, is really but an
incident.
Two Great Principles Involved.
General Chaffee Active in

Albert F. Roberta filed a communica
tion yesterday with the Election Commis
sion requesting that his name be with
drawn from nomination as Supervisor on
the Republican ticket. Roberts assigns
as a reason for resigning that he was reg
istered in San Jose four years ago and the
charter requires a residence of five years
in this city for nominees.
The old Republican County Committee,
of which Augustus Tilden is chairman,
will meet to-night for the purpose of fill
ing the vacancy on" the ticket caused by
the withdrawal of Roberts. ' Official no
tice of Adam Andrews' withdrawal may
be. filed before the committee meets. ~ In
that event there will be two ..vacancies to
fill. It is doubtful if Asa R. Wells' friend,
B. P. Flint, can be persuaded to go on
the ticket at this time. - 1. J. Truman,
Colonel Joseph G. Giesting and Colonel
Fred Burgin are mentioned as acceptable
men. Colonel Giesting is a Grand Army
man and National Guardsman. He was
a delegate from the Fortieth Assembly
District in the late Republican conven
tion. Colonel Burgin. was formerly presi
dent of the Donahue railroad and is one
of the executors of the estate of Mervyn
Donahue.
The fact is noted by the politicians that
neither the campaign committee nor the
new County Committee created by the
late Republican convention is to fill the
vacancies. The Tilden committee, over
which there hangs a cloud, is to act.
Some of the politicians suggest that the
Bouvier County Committee should get in
and assert its right under the law to act
for the party. The new County Commit
tee, consisting of four from each Assem
bly district and eighteen at large, making
ninety all told, will not enter the political
arena as a governing body until January
1, 1902. The calculations are that the body
will hold office for two years and be in
possession of the works throughout the
gubernatorial campaign of next year and
the municipal campaign of the year fol
lowing. The committee will not amount
to much as a governing body If the pri
mary election law holds good, but the
push politicians are guessing that the Su
preme Court will overthrow the law on
account of the provision requiring voters
to sign their names and indicate their
party affiliation.

oner, was the first speaker, and he was
followed by Thomas F. Eagan, candidate
for Recorder. Eagan said that there were
but three issues in the : campaign â first,
shall the city be honestly and economic
ally governed? second, shall our city gov
ernment be administered with fairness
and even-handed justice? and third, shall
the wage worker be declared unfit to
hold office in a city he makes his home?
He referred to W. F. Herrin as an an
archist. In speaking of the McNab-Phe
lan convention he said that the election
of "that man Wells or that gentleman
Tobln" meant either the retention of Chief
Sullivan or the election of Captain "Witt
man In his stead. The names of the police
officials were greeted with groans and.
hisses. 1
Eugene E. Schmitz was received with
great applause and said in part;
Nicholas Hcrrero, the murderer of the
famous Captain Lara of the Manila po
lice, whose services to the United States
during the height of the insurrection
â¢were invaluable and whose faithfulness
â¢was never questioned, was sentenced to
but ten years in Bilibid prison. The light
sentence was due to the fact that the
convicting evidence was rather menirar,
although there was little doubt that lier
rero was guilty cf the assassination.
Military officers have decided that
stricter measures than those that have
been in vogue In dealing with natives by
the courts-martial are necessary, and
death instead of life imprisonment is
now generally the penalty for murder.
It was the practice for a long time to
give native criminals severe sentences
and then for the reviewing authorities
to commute them. The leniency did not
seem to have the desired effect and
crimes multiplied. During the last two
months, however, a score or more of
Filipino murderers have been executed
and other criminals have received heavy
sentences.
The Rev. Dr. A. L. Hazlett of Colo
rado Springs, Colo., is in San Francisco
bound for the. Philippines as a Commis
sioner appointed by the Secretary of "War
to Investigate the charges of gross im
morality in our military camps in the
Far East. Dr. Hazlett was selected for
the Important position on recommenda
tion oi Major General MacArthur. He

Thomas.
Vagrue rumors have drifted to this
country from time to time that the sol
diery were giving way morally as well as
physically In the far avray possessions,
and the religious people of the United
States have demanded an investigation
vhich shall not be an army investigation.
Dr. Hazlett states that he has heard
that all kinds of evils are prevalent in
the Philippines and that the authorities
are very lax.
Army omcers are rather amused at the
idea and think that if the newly ap
pointed Commissioner follows about two
days in the waKe of a paymaster on one
of his trips through tne outlying prov
inces he will be decidedly shocKea. How
ever, it is not probable that Dr. Hazlett
will eo much outside of Manila, lloUo
Â«Lnd Mindanao, where he will lind condi
tions about the same as among large
bodies of troops in the home garrisons.
Troops Sent to Permanent Stations.
The second, and third battalions of the
Eighteenth Infantry, which arrived on
a. late transport, have been ordered by
General Young to i>ermanent stations in
the Hast. Companies K, F, G and H go
to Kort D. A- rtussell, Wyoming; Com
panies K, L. and M go to Fort Douglas,
Utah, and Company i to Fort Duchesne,
Utah.
General Chaffee, after extensive cor
respondence vnth the AVar Department,
has decided to abolish the United States
general hospital at Nagasaki, Japan.
Captain Irving M. Rand and First Lieu
tenants B. H. Dutcher and E. E. Parsons
of tne medical department, who were
on duty at that station, have been or
dered to San Francisco. The hnsp'Tal
&t Nagasaki was indispensable while the
volunteers were comiiiij a^u going i>Â«
tween the Philippines and this city, but
the travel cf enlisted men across the
Pacific is now coropartively light, and
ail cases of sickness can be attended to
on the transports by the regular medi
cal staff.
Or.e of the four companies of engineers
now in the Philippines has been ordered
to Mindanao for duty. This is considered
by the army authorities to indicate that
the engineering work in Luzon is ap
proaching- completion. For two years
the Americans have been endeavoring to
make military reads in the Philippines
over which it shall be possible to con
duct wagon trains during the rainy sea
son. The natives were In the habit of
bridging the streams by which the isl
ands are traversed in every direction
with frail bamboo structures, which were
washed away annually when the first
floods came. Corps of engineers have
built many substantial bridges between
the more important polrts on Luzon, and
safe travel even in August and Septem
ber is now possible.

V. Dear Mrs. Ptxkham : â I want to
tell you and all the youn g ladies of the

eight months from suppressed men-
struation, and it effected my entire
system until I became weak and debil-
itated, and at times felt that I had a
hundred aches in as many places. I
only used the Compound for a few
weeks, but it wrought a change in me
which I felt from the very beginning.
I have been very regular since, have no
pains,' and find that my entire body is
as if it was renewed. I gladly, recom-
mend X<ydia E. Pinkham's "Vege-
table Compound to everybody." â

change, and is the surest reliance for
woman's ills of every, nature.
