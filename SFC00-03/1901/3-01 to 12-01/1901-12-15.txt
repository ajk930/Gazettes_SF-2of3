THE CHRISTMAS
ICE MAID
THE SUNDAY OALLu
Qdoii the mountains, high ahove the snow,
Too steeD for hollu or for mlstletoa,
Wherscruel winds forever round T blaw,
Th-ra dwells a plant the anaels know,
Upon the earth its timid leaf-stalks lie,
Stark, bare and shivaru underneath the sku,
For sun and warmth and heat in vain theu sighj
Under its -icu blasts theu die.
But ones a twelYemonthâ on, the frozen steeDâ -
From out th3ir stalks the timid leaflets creep, 1 .
And from their leaves, as though waked from a sleep,
The white wax flowers softlu peeb,
The ]ce maid gentlu touches them, theu sau,
A maid who Christmas dau passes that wauj
And whisparing to the frozen, dead old sward,
TpHs flower and leaf to greet its Lord.THE BEAUTY
QUEST
THE one subject which retains al
ways a deep and abiding hold on
feminine interest Is personal beauty.
Its cuest Is endless.
Nor need we deny the impeachment,
for do.es not Slmonides place the
divine gift of beauty as the . second
great blessing in life, health only taking
precedence. ' One of the great powers of
the world, It has always been; that it is
also "love, poetry, Heroism," Is a strong
assertion perhaps, but one with several
grains of truth in it.
In older days beauty was personified.
In Greece," witness Aphrodite; in Egypt,
Hathor; in Persia, Ariahita; In Carthage.
Tanit; in Babylon, Mylitta; in Byblu3,
Baaltls; Ashtaroth among the Sldonlans
and Aschera among the glades of Judea.
Then came a time when It was con
sidered unworthy vanity to think about
or discuss the subject and the body was
to be treated by all wise people with con
temptuous jndifference. Nowadays, hap
pily, we' consider it a positive duty to pre
serve and cultivate all the gifts entrusted
to us by nature, and to try to turn de
fects into attractions, for every oneâ tho
maiden of sixteen, or the matron of sixty
âcan be in some way pleasing, and
should be; "the woman who does not
please Is a false note in the harmonies of
nature."
Although we may not all be radiant
beauties. It is something each owes to her
self to take care that her good points are
not allowed to deteriorate through neg
lect of the many details which go to make
up the personality. This means that we
are to get on more intimate terms with
Hygela; learn her ways and follow them.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Nearly all women might easily Be niorh
healthy than they are, and consequently
far more fascinating and beautiful.
It may seem that so much has already
been written about beauty and how to
letain it that there is absolutely nothing
left to say. Since the time of Cyrus' old
grandfather, Astyages, who used to put
paint around his eyes; since the reign of
Cleopatra, who daily bathed her dusky
complexion in .rose water and benzoinâ
since those old dead and gone times, up
to the present moment, new, interesting
and valuable theories and suggestions re
garding personal charms are constantly
being advanced. It seems worth while
occasionally to consider some of the im
portant and novel points bearing on the
subjectâ in other words, to get all the
hclu wo can in the cultivation of beauty.
The Throat, Shoulders and Arms.
An important first consideration ia the
throat, shoulders and arms â do they pos
sess the correct artistic curves and the
proper alabaster whiteness?
The cultivation of artistic curves and
fair, clear skin, in throat, shoulders and
arms is worth some little consideration
for every woman who includes therein
her weapons of atttraction.
The throat should be round, full and
pillar-like.
The shoulders should be sloping and
not too broad, but rather too broad than
too narrow.
The arm' to reach the standard of classic
beauty should have a rounded outline,
with no sharpness at the elbowa. and
tapering gently down to a well-shaped,
not too large wrist.
Before attempting to whiten the skin,
endeavor to remove sunburn, tan and
moles, which naturally la not the work of
a moment. However, wonders may be
accomplished In a comparatively short
irme by persevering treatment. Elrctrl
city is one remedy for moles, but tljere
are others. Cover the white skin around
the mole with a toilet cream, and then
Â«pply acetic acid for several nights until
the mole disappears. The acid must not
touch the white skin and should be put
on with a tiny camel's hair brush. For
removing sunburn and tan use:
Citric acid 1 oz.
Violet water ' .2 oz.
Glycerin 2 oz,
Apply with a linen pad before retiring;
In the morning bathe the skin with warm
water. Rain water is always preferable
for the bath.
The throat, shoulders and arms may all
be treated to this bath. After a thorough
washing with soap and warm , water,
sponge the skin with rum and Ice cold
rose water in equal quantities. Rum gives
tone to the flesh and makes it feel de
lightfully satiny to the touch. Then with
a flesh brush go over every inch of the
skin until it glows and tingles. It' Is the
brush that quickens blood vessels into ac
tion and revives circulation. Follow this
with a thorough massage with a cream
much used by Oriental women; it Is
called
MECCA BALSAM,,
Oil of white poppy ,, 8 oz!
Oil of sweet almonds 8 oz.
Spermaceti 2 oz.
White wax l oz.
Mecca Balsam Vi oz.
Melt the wax and spermaceti, add the
oil of poppy and almonds, and beat to
gether until they cream, then add the
balsam and one gill of rose water, rub
bing until it will take no more rose wa
ter', and breaks away in flakes or lumps.
Put into a jar and cover with a little
rose water. Violet water may be substi
tuted for rose water, if preferred. A word
as to balsam.' To such 1 an extent was a
love of perfumes carried in ancient
Greece and Rome that each part of the
body must havo its peculiar unguent; the
neck and arms required balsam; the
cheeks and breast, palm oil; the liair,
sweet marjoram; the knees, wild thyme,
and the feet and legs, sweet ointment.
The court at Versailles had a special per
fume for each day with Louis XIV to
superintend the making.
This, however, is a digression. After
treating the throat, shoulders and arms
with balsam cream, powder the ekln
lightly with alum, starch and carmln*.
pounded to a fine powder, and sifted
through bolting cloth. Alum, white sugar,
gum arable, pounded and sifted, then
made into a paste with water, is good for
blotches in the skin.
Having by this time achieved a white
throat, and it is the throat only that is
just 'now .under consideration,' it must
next be made full and round. Unsightly
hollows on each side of the collar bone
must be filled out. '
1. Bend the head slowly forward, un
til the chin touches the neck, then slowly
raise the head to Its normal position. Re
peat these movements fifteen times.
2. Bend the head backward as far as
possible, and then raise to its normal po
sition; repeat the movement.
3. Bend the head sideways, two times
to the right and as many to the left.
4. Roll the head slowly to the right, to
the leftâ and then forward.
5. Stand before the mirror, and attempt
to draw out and down the corners of the
mouth. It will probably take some time
to accomplish this; only persevere; when
you are able to get control of the muscles
you will see the cuticle of the entire front
of the neck move upward. The muscle la
attached to the cuticle of the chin, and
around nearly the whole length of the
lower jaw; its lower insertions are at
tached to the cuticle of the chest, and
when in contraction it pulls the corners
of the mouth downward, .and the cuticle
of the chest upward.
Now this is the prescription: Apply the'
remedy; be faithful to yourself, and I
give you my word that in timeâ perhaps
two weeksâ the outward and visible result
is going to be a roundness and fullness of
throat which approaches the artistic
model.
It will be well to pay heed to some com
mon sense rules, having brought your
neck Into fairly good condition.
Don't bathe in hard water; soften It
with borax.
Don't bathe while very warm, and only
occasionally in cold water.
Give the neck aa much freedom and air
ns possible. High "chokers" and> the stiff
llnpn In which tailor-made and athletic
young women delight are the worst foes
to a beautiful neck.
Another thing which shoemakers and
physicians will tell you to do is to wear
loose shoes and very thin stockings. This
will give the feet the nearest approach
possible to barefoot ease and be an excel
lent thing for the whole body.

â was honored In "her own country" to an
extent to which even few sovereigns have
attained, and -which makes one have a
greater faith in the gratitude of human
ity.' â  :â â â â . â  â¢..-â  .. '..
Sacramentans. always noted for their
pride In thejr prominent cifzens and their
beautiful* city, remember as a day ever
memorable; May C..18S5. On that day took
place a noral festival In cejebration of
the sift by Mrs. â¢Crocker to the city of
Sacramento" of the magnificent Crocker
Art Gallery. This gallery was built by
her husband. Judge .Crocker, on his re
turn from. Europe, and was. just in the
rear of their, elegant home at Third and
O streets, which was formerly the old
.Hastings place. It is full of art treasures
.comprised in the gift? of .Mrs. Crocker,
consisting of 700 oil paintings selected by
the Judge abroad and some 3330 selected
studies in portfolios and steel <piatÂ£. col
lections of >the most famous galleries of
the.world. The richly adorned art school
room and library are now considered as
the center â  of -or. 2 of the best art schools,
of hie United States. : It has been of un
told elevating and educational advantage
to the city of Sacramento. As a- gift It
represented a value of $750,000 and was *
for the free use of the people for all time.
The floral festival which thfcrgift called
forth from the warm-hearted Sacramen
tans lasted two days and has probably
never been equaled "as a season of per
fume and blossom anywhere in the world.
.The schools, factories and business housoa .
of the" city closed and all U16 churches and'
fraternal societies participated in the
event.,' The floral, reception to -Mrs.
Crocker and many of the ceremonies were
held in the great Agricultural building: of
the State Exposition, which with its' gla3S
v/alls and cruciform shape lent itself ad
mirably to the bewilderingly beautiful en
semble of the .affair. . Flowers came not
only, from the gardens : of Sacramento in
unrivaled profusion, but from % all over the
State in tons of quantity 'and made into
every, conceivable design. When Mrs.'
Crocker, in company with a picked escort
of ladles, drove to the .crystal reception
hall/the air was literally- filled with roses
and blossom's '. thrown by double lines of
school children dressed in white.. The hall
itself was divided into aisles of flowers
broken by t kiosks, bowers and temples, all
made' of flowers and capable of holding
many guests. -in* the center was a gay
Maypole, around which danced merrily a;
hundred or more children, winding it with
gay ribbons as 'they ' danced and sang.
Upona dais sat "Mrs Crocker, surrounded
by a retinue of prominent women, and as
S0OO school children passed In review be
fore Her each one laid a bouquet before the
dais, until the honored guest, she who al
ways 'wished 'to 'be ''plain without pomp
and rich -without ''show,'* sat enthroned
above a' solid' bank of blossoms that over
flowed anfl' entirely surrounded t3ie plat
form.' ' .*â  - â¢''â  } ' *';'.'. * 'â â '
Fully 15,000 persons (tiled the pavilion
and joined in the homage to a benevolent
and kindly woman. A lady of San Fran- #
clsco j who was '.present describes tho
Bcene ( aa "an ovation worthy of a queen,"
and gays. that tears came into many eyes
besides these of tho recipient of so much
honor. In the, evening a grand ball was
Clven, and the Sacrumento Society of
California, Pioneers ,- presented Mrs.
CrocKer with four tablets of solid gold
nnd silver, representing epochs In the his
tory of California. .
Mrs. Crocker before her marriage was
a Miss Rhodes, ghe was born In Akron,
Ohio, on February 25, 1822. Her parents
wtre of German' descent and she wae one
of a large family of brothers and sisters.
Her parents died when she was quite
young and her girlhood , was spent with
a married sister, Mrs. Anna L. .Bender,
in South Bend, Ind. ,Here Bhe 'is re
membered by friends as .*'a Btately, tine
looking girl, kindly always,' a regular
â¢weet,\ old-fashioned girl." She was a
good vocalist and a prominent member of
lb.3 choral society of the town, as wat
also R B. Crocker, then a prominent
.young attorney it South Bend. He was
married andlMargaret Ithodes' was Ids
wlfo>. friend, and assisted In nursing her
in inntsR.JTha- wire died leaving a young
daughter.; and then the two singers found
thr-lr liparts' â drifting. toVether. In 1853,
with blessing's following her, . Margaret
Rhodes left her home in South Bend -to
Join Mr. Crocker in New rbrkldirtieW
the two were married by the Rev." Henry
Ward Deecher and immediately took ship
for California via Panama. ' : ;'
Then began some of the best and hap- â¢
Plest years in Mrs. Crocker's long and
useful life. They went [ to* Sacramento,
where E. B, Crocker took a partner, and
the law linn of Crocker & Robertson was
started. . They had ups and downs, but
always a competence. - The Judge 1 was a
prominent abolitionist, a leaning rather
frowned upon at that time in California,
and they lived very quietly. Then came"
the appointment of . Mr. Crocker as .
Judge of the Supreme Court of Califor
nia in 1S63, a position in which he is said
to have rendered more decisions than any
other Judge before or since. .Then he be
came the early counsel for the Central
Pacific Railroad, of which his brother/
Charles Crocker, -was .one of the organ
izers,- and was closely identified with the
building of the road. He made out tfie
incorporation papers and later gave much
time v and study to the affairs of the road.
Mrs. Crocker always had a loving re
membrance "of Saernmento on account of'
those days of stress, as so many of the
other railrcad people have. By- the
death of Mrs. .Crocker ; - Mrs. Jane Stan
ford is left as the only remaining woman
who was the wife of a man who was one
of the original group of Central Pacific
organizers; With the improvement in His
fortunes Judge. Crocker *bought a .large
block 6f land at ths â¢corner of Third and
O streets ir. Sacramento, containing 1 the
home of Hastings, a well-known banker
of the time. This locality was well known
as a great social center. He hart tho,
house entirely remodeled and made more
than 1. elegant, and Mrs. Crocker enter
tained most lavishly there, particularly
when her daughter, Amy, was just grow
'in.T into womanhocd. At ' the rear he
built his art gallery, and on the oth2r
side of his house he built a rfandsome
housefor Mrs. Charles Scudder, â¢ his
daughter Mary, of whom her stepmother
wÂ«.s always very fond." She is now Mrs.
Walker of Connecticut.
Through study and â¢ overwork Judge
Crocker , was attacked with brain -trouble

LATE
MARGARET
CROCKER.
practically an Invalid and some of the
time ho was seriously ill. During all this
time until his death in Sacramento about
twenty years ago Mrs. Crocker gave up
all other interests, even those of her chil
dren, in her complete devotion to her hus
band. In these years her kindly, even na
ture stood her in good stead. After her
husband's death she became Interested in
spiritualism and for some years followed
its teachings. .
Always she displayed a trait which is
not considered a common one among peo
ple who have been so richly blessed in
this world's goods, for at the time: of
â¢Judge Croqker's death, his estato was
worth about eight million dollars, which
has been preserved and added to since.
This trait was her care and affection for
her relatives who did not happen to be In
affluent circumstances. Sometimes her
beneficence took the form of building
houses, for which she had quite a hobby.
She sometimes would take distarrt cousins,
or even proteges of no blood ties, whom
she became interested in, educated them
and started them In business. If they
were married or needed a home she would
put them in one of her new houses and
let them pay a small rent. If at the end
of a certain time, usually a short one,
they were getting along well and were at
tentive to business, she would deed the
house over to them. Many are. the
Christmas gifts she has made in this man
ner. â¢ ' - . . '
She built the Crocker mansion in L03
Angeles and also a hotel there, ; which
latter she turned over to a nephew. She
virtually adopted young Elwood Bender;
son of Wilson Bender, a relative in Los
Angeles, when the boy's mother died. She
did" for him as her. own son, advanced
him in every way possible. 'He Is now
married and a successful banker of El
mlra, N. Y.~ ''â .â â  â  ' â â / ""?:â  \
She was always very fond of young peo
ple and her home was full of them as
,long as she was able to. have it so. She
gave them a royal good time in the gener
ous v.ay that was part of her nature and
at her side when she died were two young
women who will grieve for her most sin
cerely, They were her adopted daughter,
Gladys Ashe, daughter of Mrs.. Jackson
Gouraud, formerly. Mrs. Porter Ashe. and
Miss Evelyn Lawton, daughter of Charles
Lawton, former Lieutenant Governor of
the State of Washington. Miss Lawton's
mother was a niece of, Mrs. Crocker. Miss
Gladys Ashe is now a pretty young girl of
17 or thereabouts and was a great favorite
with her adopted mother.
It was in Sacramento, where all of Mrs.
Crocker's children were born, that her
philanthropy found freest expression.
One of the tenderest of motives actuating
her projects \was found in the Bell Con
servatory. .. ',. > â¢

Crocker with the idea of making another

ornament to the beautiful city which sha
always loved, and It was Intended that
the poor could always apply there and re-'
celve flowers to decorate the graves of
their dead free of charge. She also want
ed to show what could be grown in the
way of many varieties of plants with the
aid of the favorable climate and soil of
Sacramento. But it grew, to be such a
trouble and expense that she. presented
the conservatory to a relative living In
Sacramento.
In 18S3 some charitable women of Sac
ramento started a fund and were engaged
in organizing a home for old men and
women. They bought a certain block of
land with a house, the old Whitney place,
but soon found that they had undertaken
more than they could easily carry
through. It was then that Mrs. Margaret
Crocker came to the front- and offered to
take the place oft their hands and endow
It as a home for old ladies only. She
remodeled the house, endowed the insti
tution at a cost of- $130,000 and it was thus
that the well known Marguerite Home for
Old Ladles' in Sacramento came into ex
istence. It is intended for the better class
of gentlewomen, who have not place* in
which to spend their declining years, and
the admittance fee is Â§1500. The home will
accommodate about -twenty live old. la
dies. It is pleasantly situated, and in the
midst of a beautiful garden. It is under
the direction of a board of lady managers -
and there. Is much peaceful rest and hap
piness there.' >
Mrs. Crocker spent much time in Sun
Francisco in the mansion at the corner of
Washington street and .Van Ness avenue,
when Mrs. Porter Ashe wa3 living there.
That house was a wedding present from
Mrs. Crocker to her daughter Amy. Somo
few years ago, finding that two of her'
daughtersâ Jennie, ' who married Senator ,
J. Sloat Fassett of . New York, and Amy,
â¢ now Mrs. Jackson Gouraudâ were apt to
be permanently away from her, she de
cided to remove to New York to be near
them. She did :so and. has since resided â 
at Larchmont Park, New York, where
she had a most, beautiful home, her
grounds 1 adjoining those of her daughter
Amy. Sacramento received another gift
as' a consequence of Mrs. Crocker's re-
mo\al to New York. Sho presented her
handsome' mansion '.'"â¦ Third â and O
streets, "which must have been full of the
memories ;of her first and happiest Cali
fornia days for her, to a local charity for
the purpose of a Rescue Home. Since
â¢ then she has lived very quietly, never
having sought to live in society at any
time In her life purely for her own pleas

Mrs. Crocker had three other children,
now deceased. Katie, the e'deet, married
J. O'B. Gunn of Sun Francisco. The otli- "
era were a daughter Nellie and a son who
,died in infancy. Two years ago Mrs.
Crocker paid a visit to San Franc sco anil
began the 'erection of a home at the cor- â 
ncr of Franklin and Clay streets. Find-
Ing' upon her return to New York that
shei* would remain there permanently, the.
house was.; sold without her ever haying '.
seen it. "One of her San Francisco chari
ties was the endowment of two beds in
the Woman's Hospital. â 
â¢ Always, of the most simple tastes, sho !
found in the quiet of her life at Larch
mont a restful spot in which to pass her
. declining years. -Her own life was not â¢
free from troubles, but she believed, evil
â of.;no one ami' lost* much of the sting' of
her own ' cares in, h,er , constant* care for
others. One of her greatest pleasures at
Larchmont was to take a couple of ser
vants and spend the day In the wools,
near the water 1C possible, for she always
loved nature. With her wealth she waa
the object of constant applications fOi^
financial help from all sorts and condi-
tions gf people, and always made it a
point to send a courteous answer to these
letters, if "possible. In some cases she did
extend help to perfect strangers. If she
found they were deserving and had made
gome effort to help themselves, which waa
always a. recommendation to her charity.
She was always unostentatious, kindly
and approachable to allâ qualities which
endeared her to the people of Sacramen
to, particularly in the early days when
the amenities of life were perhaps less
thought of.
.At the beginning of the Ions illness
which resulted in her death Mrs. Crocker
had just purchased and moved into a new
house on East Forty-ninth street, New
York, and had the pleasure of seeing her
daughter, Mrs. Gouraud, settled in a new
home very near by her. Then, at the ago
of 7!) years, this true-hearttd woman of
"gentle soul, to human race a friend,"
passed peacefully away surrounded by her
loved ones. She leaves a number of rela
tives in Sun Francisco to mourn and cber-
Jsh her memory. Her asheB will be
brought to Sacramento to rest beside
those of her late, husband.
Sacramento hes sent from her city gatea
a long" list of citizens who have distin
guished themselves in the world, but none
left behind a sweeter, purer memory than
did the late Mrs. Margaret Crocker.
She gave her honors to the world again;
Her Messed i'urt to heaven, and slept Id pcae*.

It was named Mantown because there was not a
woman in it. The Parson insisted that for that same
reason it should have been named a name found largely
hi sacred history â thc road to which, it is said, is paved
with good intentions. , .
The Parson was my partner and we cabined together
vith "Polaris." Polaris was our other' partner. He
sjid he came from thc north pole. I never believed it.
When the Parson, who was an early riser, threw the
wet floursack he had wiped his hands atid face on at my
head and said: "The old lady up there's pickin' her
geese, Tom," and Polaris and I looked out and saw the
feathery white flakes falling, we laughed. When it kept
on and on till the snow was nine feet deep the laugh was
on thc other side of our mouth. The snow settled and
froze, and we were in for it.
There was whisky enough and provisions enough, so
that we did not fear dying of thirst and hunger, but we
were pining for amusement.
Forty days and forty nights shaking dice and playing
poker at the Red Goose had become monotonous. Th*
Red Goose was a saloon. Thc way it got its name war
this â which is also the beginning of the end of the thins
that happened. It was all finished, the saloon. was. and
ready for business, and a big smooth signboard wait
ing to be painted, but there wasn't a man there cou'kI
paint it. We were falling into the way of speaking of i;
as "Old Bob's" when along came a dandy-looking
young chap with pants cut smaller at the ankle than at
the knee*, and boothccls four inches high and tapered
down to the sire of a two-bit piece, lie wore a soft
s-louch hat, an embroidered flannel shirt, and had a 'red
tiiU sash tied around his waist.' He said he was "broke'
and looking for a job.
Old Bob asked him if he could paint a sign for the
saloon. He asked what kind of a sign was wanted.
Old Bob told him he wanted a figure of great originality
::nd one that would tell the name without any printed
matter. He always put on airs in his speech when he
thought he knew more than the other fellow did, and
the- dandy chap was modest-looking, in spite of his
clothes.
Weil, the stranger took the job, and when it was
dene and put up over the door and old Bob came out
to size it up he was roaring mad. He swore he wouldn't
IÂ»ay for it. The figure painted on it was a big red
goose. The painter called all the town to prove that
he had painted according to order by asking each one
separately what it was. Every one of them said. "Red
goose." He then asked pointedly if it was not of "great
originality" and every one to a man said it was the
first red goose they had ever seen. So old Bob had to
pay for the sign and set up the drinks besides. After
they had settled it the dandy chap sat down to a game
of poker in the saloon which he had christened, and in
the morning of the next day walked out of it and left
with all the available gold of the town; in his pockets.'
That was the beginning of Mantowh. We worked
like beavers all summer and fallâ dug and drifted and
picked and shoveled and panned and sluiced and
<l?.mmed â gambled and fought and drank â and dreamed
of home. "
Then the snow fell. Forty days snowed in had de
piessed us. That night we felt. as though something
were going to happen, and we wished it would.
Old Bob was getting uneasy; Â«he was afraid the men
would cease to patronize him and go in for a camp
meeting or something just to break the monotone of
the situation.
It was that night I spoke of â the night before Christ
mas. The boys kept a roaring fire in the fireplace and
tried to keep the cheer going, but it was too plainly an
effortâ -all except at the card tables. The most improb
able things always happen without warning. In at the
door of the Red Goose, like a bird blown from the
night, came a -shivering, oldish-looking man. His hair
was long and a stubbly beard hid the under half of his
face. He was lost, he said, and nearly fioze, and had
the rheumatism and wanted to warm at the fire.
We all stood back and let him have the fire to him
self. He stretched his long, slender fingers in the
warmth of the large blaze, warmed his feet at it and
tiirned his back to warm. His eyes wandered round the
bic. ugly room and lit en the piano.
The proprietorâ it always pleased old Bob to be
called the "proprietor" â said that piano had cost him a
bucketful of gold and nobody ever played two ounces*
worth on it yet. He expected a different sort of a
town when he had it brought up.
The man at the fire set his glance so -questioningly on
the instrument that Polaris volunteered to tell him tint
it was a "pyanner," and asked him if he could play on
the ' critter.
He said he used to play a little, and began to rub his
hands together. In a minute a dozen of voices were
urging him to play. He said he was afraid his fimjers
were too stiff. They gave him a drink of whisky and
seated him at the piano. He ran his fingers along the
keys several times and began to play. The men looked

IT happened over In the Mission last year, and It made

â ^r >"T "\ SEN Celia Curtis told John
\ A I Greyrigge that she did not
W \/ know whether she loved him or
Y V sot it waa the exact truth.
She knew that she admired
him. He was. without doubt, exceedingiy
admJrable. Everybody told her that he
â¢was a fine business man. She knew that
duty invariably came before pleasure and
there was a certain honest rugged
strength about him that expressed itself
not only in his daily actions, but in his
face and general bearing.
But was he lovable? This was one of
the questions that Miss Curtis asked her
self half a dozen times a day. Another
was. Could she love a man who was only
admirable? She had not answered cither
of these queries when she bade John
good-by on the deck of the Gaelic early
In July, nor did she answer them -when
she wrote to him from Japan. Every let'
ter she received from him began, ended
and centered with appeals to her to lova
him. to marry him. And she. with all a
woman's wit, replied to him but did not
answer himâ just because she could not.
Love a man who would always put busi
ness first? How could she? Marry a man
'who. aa soon aa the honeymoon had
waned, would give her a place second to
"affairs"? Could she endure that? And,
yet, he was so good, so true and he did
love her so.
One afternoon late in November Miss
Curtis stood by the mail box in the Grand
Hotel at Yokohama, Indecision in every
line of her face and figure. A long blue
envelope was half in and half out of the
avaricious little iron mouth of the box.
but her fingers held one end. Out on the
blue bay the big liner waited. In the long
blue letter, if she mailed it, John would
read that Cella would, sail for home early
in December, that her boat would reach
Ban Francisco on December 21, that lf he
would dine with her on Christmas day
she would marry him. "You see," she
wrote, "I'm not absolutely sure yet and I
am leaving something to Fate. If Fata
will that I should be your wife, why. I'll
be there on time; but if she doesn't so
will, Bhe can hold me back, make me
miss the boat or something. Don't think
that.this 18 only a freakish acceptance of
all your love, John, but. oh, I'm not sure
and yet I know that I loâ like you, John.
I'll leave those first two letters of the
other word and give you the other two U
I see you on Christmas day."
But the blue letter still hung evenly
balanced in the open lid. Then Miss Cur
tis heard footsteps in the marble corridor;
she hastily relinquished lier hold on the
envelope and turned to confront the little
blue-coated official who was gathering up
the mail for the outgoing steamer.
"That's a good omen for John," com
mented Miss Curtis, and she laughed
lightly at the Idea of Fate disguising her
self In the livery of a Japanese postman.
A few hours later she watched her grimy
messenger bearing the letter out from
the land-locked harbor on Its way to her
lover.
The Gaelic sailed promptly and Miss
Curtis was safely on board. Fate had
thrown no obstacle in the way and Celia,
with occasional mutinous gleams In her
eyes and self-dlsdalnlng lips was already
contemplating herself in the light of a
dutiful wife, neglectedâ for business only,
of courseâ but stopping at home, attend
ing to the house, darning John's socks
and performing various other prosaic and
unromantlc duties. She knew only too
well all of Greyrigge's ideas about wives
and mothers. He had Impressed them well
upon her, and while she did not actually
regret her letter she still wondered if it .
was not very foolish to try to love a man
who was only admirable and who never, -
never, in all the world would have a ro
mantic idea or even think spontaneously
without duly weighing the consequences.
But immediately upon the tail of this
thought trod an Impudent HttlÂ© query: In
spite of all that, though, isn't John lov
able?
For ten days and nights the Gaelic had
THE SUNDAY CALL.
A CHRISTMAS
IN YELLOW
rolled along ta her narrow path, on thÂ«
captain's chart -when suddenly Miss Curtis
was awakened from her soundest sleep by
the sudden cessation of all noise. ThÂ»
throbbing, pulsing heart of tha steamer
had ceased to beat, but, being a lay
eailor, the girl did not rightly construe the
silence; she turned over In her narrow
berth and permitted the waves to cradle
her back Into dreamland. In the morn
ing: there was the same stillness and on
deck she encountered the Information that
some alight accident had happened to tha
machinery, that there would NÂ» a slight
delay. Slight? How slight? Oh. a day
er. at most. two. Two? The twenty-first
'jo the twenty-third, a close margin that
would mean. And would It surely not be
more than two days? Captain Hard,
Ignoring veracity for the sake of Impart
ing confidence and comfort to hla pas
sengers, answered, "Probably only one."
But Miss Curtis curled herself ud on
her deck chair In the shadow of the big
black sail and â¢ contemplated the possibil
ities. For the first time she wondered If
John would think her letter too frivolous;
If he would be annoyed. But she knew
that she could, with half a dozen w-rd3.
dispel any such feelings on his partâ If
ehe were there in time. And suddenly she
realized that she wantedâ wanted desper
ately to be there on time and the mora
ehe realized how John would look at de
â¢ay the more she longed to keep her tryst.
Some fifty hours clanged themselves off
r>n the ship's bells and on Cella's nerves
before the welcome thud of the engines
were heard again and even then Miss
Curtis was not comforted because among
'.he passengers passed ominous whispers
about a necessarily slow passage and as
the days crawled by she saw or thought
she saw a scarcely concealed anxiety on
the faces of the shin's officers.
At last, however, the ocean was crossed
and every one knew that land was close
at hand. On the afternoon of the twenty
third. Just before sunset, a pray sea. mist
rose up and shut out the line where sea
and sky met. but it was more than a sea
mist that blurred Miss Curtis' vision, for
this.- of course, meant more delay. Then
a report ran through the ship* that the
Fnrallones had been sighted. But before
the joyous tumult had subsided came the
captain's decision that he would He to
and wait for morning and the rising of
the mist.
The morning dawned clear and bright.
Tho pilot came .aboard, the city's papers
were handed to the passengers, but every
eye, every thought was on the land, the
low-lying-, dun-colored hills, the narrow
gate opening: between them, the dull, red
fort and Tamalpais rising from the sea.
Busy little tugs came pufflly forward, the
health boat leading. In Its wake the malls
and customs.
And now up from the steamer rose a
cry, low and almost Inaudible at first, but
swelling Into a howl and pitching down
Into a groan, on the steerage deck, above,
below, from all parts of the ship. For up
to the masthead went the yellow flag and
toward the quarantine station tha
steamer forged ahead.
Smallpox, abhorred and feared, had
broken out among the coolie passengers
In the steerage. At first there had been
only a few cases and these were mild,
almost problematical. Now It had de

In Celia's was despair. Why, oh, why.
had she been such a. fool aa to play with
Fate In this way? She could write to
John, perhaps, but however abject her de
spair, her apologies, would he not stand
by her own arbiter, by her own terms?
She saw no hope for anything from hla
stern, uncompromising nature, nor did
she realize that she was crediting him
with vast romanticism in believing that
ho would permit such an unbuslness-llke
creature aa Fate to play an Important
part in his life.
After a time letters and packages cama
from the home people to the prisoners.
Celia's mother wroteâ a letter full of sym
pathy and motherly dread of the disease.
Her sister wrote warning her not to bo
vaccinated on her arm, "because evening
gowns have no sleeves," etc., etc. But
there was nothing from John â no mention
of him even in the borne letters, and Cella
was possessed with an instant dread that
her hateful letter had estranged him from
her, 1 from her family and that they would
not tell her.
The day wore away as days do, even In
quarantine, and Christmas dawned To
even try to make the best of things
seemed out of the question, but the cap
tain urged that nothing would be gained
by making the worst of them, so a Christ
mas dinner was prepared. To eat it would
be impossible, Cella felt, but to absent
herself from it would be absurd, so with
dire grief in her heart she made herself
ready for it.
Just before dinner was announced the
health officer's tug came alongside There
were more letters, more packages. Would
there be one from John? Celia turned
moody eyes to the door and there stood
John himself.

THE SUNDAY CALL.HER LOST YOUTH
OH, dear, I hope they won't cut down the holly
tree," said the little old woman.
"It would be 'a shame," I answered dreamily,
garing at the plat on the North Beach water
front where TO LET signs had caught my eye.
A broken fence and tumble-down wharf, a crop of weeds
and three tottering walls marked some former home; an
English holly tree, dark, glistening and prickly, over
ehadowed the weeds.
"Yes," I repeated with an unaccountable shiver. "It
would be a shame â the first English holly tree I have
seen growing in San Francisco."
"Shame," she cried petulantly, "it would be a crime.
Why, I planted it myself one Christmas long ago."
"You did?"
I turned to look at her; an exceedingly gray little
body; gray as to alpaca dress and worn shawl; gray as
to bonnet and hair; gray even to the face â that strange
face with dual expression as of two souls looking from
troubled eyes. -
She nodded her head. "Yes, I buried myself be
neath it."
"Oh," I cried cheerfully, "are you somebody's ghost?"
And she made answer sharply, "How can I be any
body's ghost but my own?"
Then I spoke softly. "Tell me your story and I will
put it in the papers."
She edged away and scanned me doubtfully. "Would
that help to save my holly tree?"
"Of course it would; the papers can do anything."
She hesitated, glanced nervously around, then with
a quaver in her voice: "Well, it's a bargain, and I sup
pose I had better begin at once. Fifty years ago â "
"0-o-o-o-o-o--h, only fifty?"
"Fifty years is a good age- in a young country," she
snapped.
Fifty years ago I gave up a good home to run after
a man's shadow; girls were romantic fools in those
days and I wasn't going to turn my back on the boy
who got into trouble on my account.
What had he done?
Forgery. Signed my own father's name, which was
the awkward part of it. Father would not prosecute,
for my sake and that of the family, but Ned was shipped
off to California with strict orders never to show his
face in Boston again, and I was told not to think of
him. Of course this set me thinking of him every day
of my life. When he went 'away he had my promise
and he knew I would keep it.
But Jacob and Rachel's love affair was nothing to
ours: posts from California were few; I was closely
watched and I heard never a word. Yet I waited and
believed, and when my twenty-first birthday came at last
and I realized the little sum left me by my mother, I
made my preparations. I chanced a letter, telling what
ship I was coming by. quarreled with my father, though
we loved each other dearly, and started off to face hard
ships with Ned. Dear old Ned, who had been my slave
from the days when he stole cherries for me and got
whipped for his pains to those latter days when he stole
pold, hoping to make enough money to win me! Let
ter or no letter, his instinct would bring him down to
the wharf, license and ring in his pocket, the very hour
we touched California.
Ned's instinct did nothing of the kind. How my
heart beat that morning when we passed through the
Golden Gate and 1 noted the watchers up by the sta
tion on Telegraph Hill. There were many eager to
â welcome the FJying Fish, which had made her record
trip of ninety-eight days, and Ned was sure to be among
them. But alas! on reaching the wharf I saw no familiar
foce among the polyglot crowd. Hour after hour I
united, till at last, in despair, I sallied forth to seek
lodgings. It was a dull day, the harbor looked muddy,
the quays were slushy, hotels and boarding-houses
seemed alike uninviting â all romance had vanished with
Xed's disappearance; it was a miserable position for an
inexperienced girl. I was picking my way down a
brawling street â Pacific, I think â when a woman in
tawdry finery jostled me and laughed coarsely. "Look
alive, Joe," she said, laying a red hand on the greasy
coat of the man ahead of her; "stir your stumps and
make room for the quality."
f I shrank away, while the man turned round stupidly:
our eyes met. I recoiled with a cry; he stared, while a
riay tint crept over his face, flushed with drink. Then
lie caught the woman's arm and disappeared.
THAT DRUNKARD'S FACE WAS WHAT I
HAD COME TO SEEK.
None ever knew of my misery, for I had inherited my
father's obstinacy. For a week I battled with physical
depression, then I roused and faced the situation. I
must earn money, for I had spent freely, and there was
no home with Ned for n:e now. But I had read heaps
of novels in which girls made fortunes and I thought
mone3'-getting an easy task. I soon discovered my
mistake. Governesses were not. in request, newspapers
preferred my advertisements to my contributions.
wstercolo"r sketches did not provoke enthusiasm.
Even domestic service was closed to a girl who could
scarcely make a cake and had never cut put a child's
gaiment. Other employments offered in abundance,
for a winsome woman who was not too particular could
command any salary in those wild days. But I vowed I
would never bring a slur on my father's name; I
might starve, but I would not follow Ned downhill. â  -
Yet I. climbed down my own fashion: from the
Union Hotel to a cheap and nasty North Beach board
ing-house; then" one day, passing along, I saw this
place with its lktle cottage and fancied the attic.
â¢The good German landlady shook her head and said
it would not suit me, but I declared that I wanted
sketching opportunities and that the view of Alcatraz
and Marin County was delightful. So here I settled,
with what fineries and knicknacks I had brought from
the old home. Not a stick of furniture did I possess; I
slept on boxes, turned dresses into draperies, drank
toast water out of Sevres cups, and had one companion
to cheer me. the slip of English holly I had struck from
our old hedge and which flourished in its pot through
my wanderings. I found occupation, too: the place
was only untidy waste ground where they hung out
washing and spread fishing-nets, but when they knew
that I loved gardening a fence was run up for me and
I sowed the seeds which were to have ( gladdene l d Ned's
eyes. They blossomed as things do in California, their
sweet faces laughed comfort into mine, and one day
they saved my life.
I had sold jewelry, Sevres cups, pretty dresses; had
reduced my food to a minimum and was facing slow
starvation, when I suddenly remembered my great
great-grandmother, the Italian flower-girl. Why not
turn my floral instincts to account as she did hers?
Down I slipped to my little garden, plucked some dainty
posies and laid them beside the holly; then shame
facedness overtook me â how could I sell flowers on
the street? If only I had some disguise.
Suddenly my head was buried in a trunk and
I dragged out the old woman's costume in which I
once acted charades and had brought for Ned to laugh
at. Gray fro'nt and velvet headband, gray shawl, blue
spectacles, poke bonnet and darned gloves â they were
all there. Positively it was a joke. I donned
the front, painted in some crowsfect, tied the
band so as to produce wrinkles and blacked
front teeth, with all the glee of an amateur actor. When
I went downstairs my landlady stopped me to know
what I was doing on her. premises, the best compliment
my disguise could have had. Poor" soul, she laughed
and cried and scolded me far concealing my straits all
in a breath; but she promised to keep my secret.
Well, it meant daily bread, for I eked out my own
flowers with wild blossoms. I wandered over the bar
ren-looking country, protected by my old woman's at
tire, and the eschscholtzias and other California treas
ures I brought back were a novelty in those days. so>
my bunches fetched a good price, for money was freely
spent then. I knew once more the taste of good food,
and though it sounds prosaic, I can tell you that whole
some food, honestly earned, helps- to keep a good heart
in your body. I needed the good heart, too. I re
member times when I have stood outside the American

girls who made my heart
ache with pity. When I
glanced at their painted
faces and s thought that
many a one. had taken to
the life to escape , starva
tion, I thanked God that,
my father's daughter had been spared
that temptation.
So 1 made money with my posies
and a balsam I. extracted from my se
dum plants, and saved enough for a
new venture. One night I found my
self outside the Alta California office
presiding at the daintiest coffee stall
that ever stood at] street corner: my
snow-white tablecloth was flower be
decked, my cups were of old willow
pattern, the aroma of my coffee re
minded me' of my father's table, and
I was. just thinking of having a
good cry over the old days when my
first customer lounged up.
I gasped, choked down the tears
and turned to my coffee-pot with
shaking hands, for the customer was
my poor Ned in maudlin mood.
"Gosh," he said, "haven't seen such a
sight since I left the old place;
what's the charge?"
"Nothing to my. first customer," I
replied, trying hard to' speak stead
ily. "You've come to bring me
luck."
He hesitated and, stared at ' me
drank his coffee gravely, as though
sobered by some old memory, and
took off his shabby hat with the ges
ture I remembered so well. "Im not
the sort that brings luck, mother,"
he .said, gently.
"but I wish it all
the. same. ' and
thank you kindly."
But the fame of
my coffee spread

ists hunting for "types" â all gathered round my steam
ing pots. It was as good as keeping a barber's shop.
I never needed to read the papers â I was the first to
hear the news. But one came now and again who never
gossiped . and never paid. "You will turn my luck if
you, pay," I would say to this new Ned I watched so
anxiously, a Ned struggling to keep straight; his eye
cleared, his gait steadied, he looked like a decent work
ingman who had seen better days.
"You're doing well now," I said to him one evening.
"Why, yes, mother," he answered; "and I owe it to you.
Something in your voice and manner set me thinking
till I grew ashamed of wasting my life; so I tried to
shake off bad company and keep straight. I can't think
why you've been so good to a strange chap. Mayhap
you might have had a son like me?"
"Mayhap I might," I answered with a sob in my
throat, suddenly realizing all I had lost. Would life
ever give it back to me?
But one miserable night Ned stole up haggard,
shaking, a finger, at his lips. "Hush," he muttered.
"Good-by; don't say you've seen me."
"What has happened?" I asked, staring at his white
face. '
"Murder," he answered hoarsely. "Been a fool,
mother; got mixed up with the old set in a drunken
brawl and a man was killed. I swear I never touched
him, but they're after me and we've seen what the.
Vigilantes can do. I'm off."
"Stop," I cried. "Where can you hide?"
"Where I can, or â "he touched his hip pocket sig
nificantly.
I bent to him. whispering imperatively, and as he hesi-
tafed r added imploringly, "For tne sake oZ = -Ct = -fBS
son I might have had like you."
Away he sped, and a minute later I was heating cof
fee and bandying jests. Did not Ned's life depend on
my tact?
A reward was put on his head, but they never found
him. I had him safely hidden in a cave I knew of on
Alcatraz, which was then a Government reserve, but
nobody lived there. My landlady wa3 used to my er
ratic ways, for I constantly hired heT boat for my ram
bles, so I was able to row across at night with muffled
oars carrying the necessary provisions. It is a blessing;
sometimes to be eccentric. All went well till the night
I found Ned in a high fever from anxiety and discom
fort, and I knew he must be nursed at all risks. I
never stopped to weigh consequences. My landlady,
fortunately, was away nursing a sick daughter, her hus
band was as deaf as a post, and I took my chances. In
the still night, the stars blinking down like a hundred
eyes, I half led, half carried my semi-conscious darling
to the boat, rowed over and contrived, with the strength
of love's terror, to get him .up to my attic
Oh, the horror of that time when I trembled for hi*
life and did not dare to confide in a living soult For
tunately Ned was a quiet patient and attracted no no
tice; I was a good nurse, too, and able to supply him
with convalescent necessaries when the j crisis was
passed. But as his mind gained strength his body lost,
and one dawn, after a restless sleep, he roused and
looked at me. "Mother," he said, "I don't think I shall
be here long, and you have been good to me past words;
before I go I should like you to hear my story."
And then he laid his dear head on my shoulder and
told how he had loved and sinned for the high-bred girl
he had known from childhood: how she had vowed
she would remain faithful to him, sharing his poverty
and loneliness and how she never came. Instead he re
ceived a letter saying she had pledged her word to a
rich man; the shock turned him silly and he went to
the bad right off, "all for a bit of a girl, mother."
"You misjudged her," I said bitterly; "she was faith
ful andâ"
He put up his thin hand. "Her own father it wa*
who wrote to me; there could be no mistake. But it
was unmanly to ruin my life for herâ only, you see, I
loved her so.
My eyes were streaming. I could bear it no lonKer.
Slipping away I tore off spectacles, front and P r }â¢
shawl, let down my own hair and knelt beside him with
great throbs at my throat. "Ned," I said softly, "my,
Ned. don't you know me?"
He looked at me with a slow, sweet smile. Of course
I know you, little mother; you look ever so much
nicer that way, and something in your voice always
reminds me of Daphne." Then he wandered, talking of
the old days. . .
, Mechanically I went to the glass and understood. My
hair, from constant covering, was turning gray; my ar
tificial wrinkles were permanent: colored spectacles had
contracted my eyes. I was really what I pretended to
be without a trace of Ned's sixteen-year-old Daphne.^
That night he died, and even Dame Fearless quaned
before her task, for I had kept his.secret in life. I would
keep it in death. In the unnatural stillness of that attic

She raised her eyes from the paper and

ing bravado she said nonchalantly, "Well,

"Is it trueâ is It true?"
"Yes," she said, and the roses in her

Dr. John reeled back with a groan. But
only for an instant did his sorrow over

traced her steps to her chamber. 'One
looking therein might have beheld the

like a lovely broken rose, prone upon her

Dr. John Russell set himself manfully
and resolutely to forget the girl who had
ruined his life. He plunged into work

possessed. He was assistant surgeoh.in:
one of the big hospitals and had, .more
over, an excellent practice. Not content,
with all this/ occupation he worked!
among the poor and the unfortunate !n
the byways of the great town.
Now and then he caught a rumot of
Sybil. She was never" so brilliant and
triumphant. She had snatched the prize
of t"he season from the grasp of all; the
other ambitious maids : of her set. The
trousseau was preparing. Fashionable
pociety was agog over the preparations
for her wedding. Her exquisite gowns
and hats were photographed and; de

Dr. John looked at these reproductions

""â¼ LXZABETH. QUEEN. OF ROUMA
j NIA, better known by her pen
I e name. Carmen Sylva, has written a
, -I j- new book of fairy stories, which Is
published by Davis & Co., Chicago.
These stories will charm all young lovers
of beautiful tales. They are delightfully
â written. In theme and in style they re
veal the work of an experienced writer
endowed with a wealth of imagination.
While in no sense sermons, they yet teach
as their most important lesson the neces
sity of a boundless love toward all crea
tures which expresses itself in acts of
kindness and self -denial. These fairy tales
differ from some of the old-fashioned sort
in that they avoid dwelling upon descrip
tions of the horrible and the grotesque;
though they do not fail to offer a variety
of incidents as original as they are pic
turesque. As an example of the pretty
fancies sketchi-d in the stories is the one
which forms the theme of "Hans' Adven
xure With the Shadows." Hans is a lad
who for some time wonders In vain what
becomes of shadows when the sun goes
Â«lown. The replies which his mother gives
him do not eatisfy him. Finally to his
questionings comes the answer from the
t-h&dows themselves. They stop to talk to
Hans one night as they are leaving the
world. They offer to take Hans with them
ihat he may Â»eÂ«> the Shadowlaiul. whero
all the KhMdows dwell when they arÂ« suj>
iK>sed to havw vaulshed rrom existence.
' Huns has a scries of interesting adven
tures among these ethereal beings, and
cumr* back to taxrih all the better for the
Knowledge he has gained of those repU
CM of ountrlve-5.
Ueautlful In conception nnd treatment la
Jhe cton told in "A Festival In
llfavcn": of the- joyous reception ne
ourded ,-.i::iÂ«- M>rrowiÂ»nj mu::> when they
joi'rnvyed to luuvt-n from tho world which
had used them *o ill.
Otif of the stories which shows best Car
men 8ylva'Â« style and the peculiar p5ny of
her fancy is "Carina, the Harp Girl." It
1* in Â»Â»art aa follow*:
All along the banks of one of the lor.s.
narrow inlets which the lake throws out
in all directions Into the woodlands
nround, a band of Joyous children were
hurrying, shouting for glee. "Curma is
cvmiRg! Carma is coming!"
And in a little boat that kopt appearing
and disappearing between the tall {orest
treei .Nat a girl, whose sweet girlish face
was framed In a wealth of curly brown
hair tied lightly back by a red ribbon. Her
Â«H-cp-b!u# eyes, blue as iho waters of the
!akÂ«-. had a strange brightness, as though
they were lighted up by wn unseen ray;
there was a tinge of madness in them. too.
nt timf>s, as they looked out from under
the hiph arched brows. a.nd from behind
the fringe of lonp. dark lashes whose
.-hadows swept her cheek. Her soft, vel
vety skin ni slightly Funburned, her lips
were of the. richest red. hor teeth milk
white; her small hands he!d a harp, a
source of ulad expectancy to the Impa
tient little crowd that escorted her boat.
The boatman who rowed it seemed to be
an o'.d friend; ehe had many a word and
i-mile for him. and pointed out the chil
dren to him as they drew near. Thereupon
lie lay down his oars, and whiJe the bout
jrlided smoothly onward she began to tune
her harp, and at the sound the birds
flocked arour.dand flitted from bough to
bough, listeninc; with their little heads on
one side for the voice of the one singer
who alone among the children of men al
most surpassed themselves in the sweet
ness and inexhaustible variety of her
bongp.
And now the boat touched shore and the
children formed a circle on the grass
while sons after song poured from the
Hnser's throat, stirrlns and lifting up
their little hearts. She sans of the knights
<if old. and how they fought; she sang of
rives and fairies, of lordly castles and fair
<lamsels dwelling therein, of terrible mon-
Fiers. of the seas and the woods and tho
Jx-es and the hlrds- she sanp. too of all
that passes in the minds of little chfldren
till her Email hearers glanced at one an
other in astonishment, wondering wh*re
Curma could have learned all these thinjrÂ«
of which they had never spoken to any
grown-up person. â¢
But then Carma was Just like a child
herselfâ little taller than themselves that
was all. She fe'.t as a little child feels
*he only knew that she had come into the
â world to make others happyâ she knew
nothins more. That was all that had
ever been told her. She thought she could
remember still how an angel had carried
her down from heaven In his arms only
not like other children to a good 'homo
an<l loving: parents, but to a rosebush
tinrter which she was found by the (rood
iOlk who brought her up. They were very
poor, this good couple, and often haft
enough to do to earn their daily bread
but they could not find it in their heart
to leave this poor little thing to perish
with cold and hunger under the rosebush
especially as they thought that It couui
not have been without a purpose that thÂ«Â»
angel placed It In their path. Thev were
much amazed to find that the little thire
f-ould already speak, and told them how
the an po I had flown down with it an-l
had comforted it on the way by tellin" ir
that it was coming down there to heln
make ttie world more beautiful- that it
was for this reason that it was sent by
God.
She was to make the world more beau
tlful. The good couple wondered creativ
what that eouM mean. They saw well
â¢â nough that she was very beautiful, but
then there arc many beautiful children H
-,he world for whom, it seemed to them
the world Is not always so much the bet
iÂ«r. But they soon perceived that this â 
r:hl!d was as lovable as she was beauti
f-Ji; not only had she a voice like a silver
fiiite. and a temperament as Joyous as
lhat of the young skylark, but her fou!
was as purees a dewdrop through which
'ho sun shines, and -she could neither
fay nor bear an unkind word said of any
one. Everything that was sa.id to her she
Â»!iouRht was meant in kindness, and this
trusting disposition won all hearts, so
ihat folks vied with each other in shower
ing upon her all that she might stand in
rR-ed ofâ fruit anil flowers and pence. And

people would sometimes ask her.
"The angel teaches me them." <
"What aneel?" - 4
"The angel who brought me here: he
sings to me in my sleep and when I wake
I know" them."
And people shook their heads and went
on wondering. Only the children felt no
surprise. They thought it quite natural
that Carma . should sing, just as the
birds do, to whom the angels also teach
their songs, else how should they learn
them? She told how all the . children
are brought down here by angels; she
was quite sure of that, and if only chil
dren would pay heed to them the angels
would teach them many things while they
are asleep. < :
She had a harp that had been given her
by an old man who 6howed her how to
play itâ as much as he knew himself: the
rest she learned from the angel, and her
foster-parents were often astonished to
hear her playing In the night and then to
seo her next day apparently in no wise
tired, but on the contrary as bright and
lively as if she had slept the whole night
long.
It was an unfailing source of amuse
ment to the children to sail the little,
boats Carma made for them out of the
broad coltsfoot leaves skillfully bound
together with sedges: and she made little
harps of rushes, with strings of gossamer
and spider's weh. and placed them in the
boats; and the little harps began of them
selves to play so sweetly as they floated
away on th* stream that the children
were wild with delight and stretched out
their hands to catch thÂ« boats, but they
slipped away between their fingers, or if
ever one was caught the harp In it
stopped playing instantly.- â¢ â¢ â¢ AU

ry^ STORY of special interest? at this
f\ season of the year is "The Man
/ââI Who Knew Better," by T. Gal-
VÂ» I Ion. It relates, the adventures
k. which befell a man named Andrew
Judkin during several days preceding
Christmas. Judkin, so the story goes, 13
a rich bachelor, -who lives in solitary
Etate in a handsome houso In London.
Years of hard work and a devotion to
business have made him a power in that
part of the business world where his in
terests lie. Judkin cares nothing what
ever for anything in life which does not
contribute directly to his own personal
comfort or to his material interests. In
his scheme of existence there Is no place
for the exercise of lovins kindness toward
his fellow creatures.
Ever since he has been a lad he has
denied the claims of any one upon- his
bounty. Even his . only brother he has
tried to cast out of his remembrance be
cause this brother. Bob Judkin, has been
unfortunate; and, In Andrew's sight, to
be poor is to be deserving of no pity
whatever. Only those who succeed in
the struggle for wealth have an excuse
for existence, according to his creed. Such
a man can see no beauty in expenditure
of time and money like that which goes
on at Christmas time, if this has no other
object in view but Just to make people
happy. On the opening of the story wo
lind Andrew Judkin at home,* filled with
anger at the enforced Idleness which he
is compelled to undergo because the
slackness of business attendant upon
holiday time has affected even his own
interests.
In the room where Judkin is seated
there is a portrait of him, painted when
be was u little lad. It shows a. boy with
laughing, merry face, who promises to
become a man just the opposite of the*
one Judkin is. While Judkin Is Bitting
at leisure his confidential clerk cornea in
to remind him that he has an appoint
ment to keep- the next day at a town
Eome distance from London. Judkin de
cides to leave town on a night train.
When he Is comfortably settled in the
train he falls to dreaming. He imagines
I himself back again at home, in the room
containing the portrait of himself aa a
child. For some reason he feels Impelled
to take up a candle and look at the pic
ture. He finds the frame there, but tho
picture gone. At the same moment ho
hears a voice behind him calling, and he
turns to see confronting him the figure of
his childish self, apparently alive.
The child upbraids Andrew for the
hardness and selfishness of his life and
tells him that he Is soon to learn the true
worth of tho love and unselfishness which
he has derided for so manyyeais. ' i'ho
child beckons Andrew, who. drawn by a

Brekekekex. koax-koax!" But these little
tree frogs sang with such good will, the
croaking grew louder every minute, and
at last made such a din and clatter It was
like the' sound of an enormous rattle. The
children laughed till the whole wood" re
echoed, and the hares and the deer start
ed and took flight, thinking the shooting
season must have begun. .
But now came the great treat Carma
had in store for all the children: she gave
each of them one of the dear little frogs,
explaining that they are great weather
prophets and will alvrays tell when It is
going to rain, and also that they can be .
made as tame art any other animal If one*
is really fond of them. The chtl
.dren must feed ..hem well with
.flies and make them very happy
and comfortable. and they would
soon see what true and faithful little
friends they would have in the frogs.
Soon a little frog was seen to be sitting on
the dinner table in every cottage catching
all the flies and swallowing them down as
fast as it could . stuff them"
into its great big mouth. And
each child had much to tell of the
wonderful doings of his own special frog:
and every one of the little creatures hart

nice green leaves In It to go In and out of
as It liked. They were so happy that thev

form of a railway station at which the
train has stopped.
The train rushes on. and leaves Andrew
alcne In the' darkness. He Is soon mtt
by a ruffian, who knocks him insensible,
robs him and leaves him for dead in a
deserted place. The thief has exchanged
Judkin's â¢ clothes for rags, so that the
body may be taken for that of an un
known tramp.' Judkin. however, is not
dead. After a while he wakes from stu-
por into semi-consciousness. The blow he
has received has destroyed his memory
of Dast events, so that he does not re
member his name, though lie is left with
enough sense, to enable him to act in a
partially rational manner.
"Without money, In rags and not know
ing where to go for aid, the rich Andrew
.Judkin sets out to learn the lesson which
the vision has said is before him. To h^
half-crazy brain it seems as. if the child
appeared to him at intervals to guide him
along the way he must go.
. Judkin undersoes great privation ' anil
suffering. Still, in the midst of hla sor
rows he learns slowly of the great good
that exists in the world in spite of the
efforts which men like his former, self
make to deBtroy it: Some of those who
have suffered the ' greatest -wrongs at hU .
hands come forward readily to help him
In his dire extremity. |
Slowly reason returns to Judkin. and
with it. comes the memory of his Identity
and of his past life. But he has learned'
well the lesson which the spirit of .his
. childhood pointed out to him. . His recent
experience, in reality short, has been so
terrible in its intensity that It haa molded
hinr into a man who sees under -all the
sin and misery of life the good which lies
at its foundation. Â» :
"The Man Who Knew Better" is at
times, reminiscent of "A Christmas Car
ol."- but not to its detriment. If Mr. Gal
lon has, perhaps unconsciously. Imitated
some parts . of Dickens' story, he ... has
worked after . a good model and has in
fused even into those parts enough origi
lnallty to produce a creditable and satis
factory .result. On the whole, the story
is a good â¢ one, and can be recommended â¢
to those who take pleasure, as most do,'
in. associating themselves for a, little sea
son with the spirit of good \rill ; which
works to make the whole world kin.

ancholy In appearance as everâ was . assisting
manfully to get the place In order for the en
tertainment of the eveningâ fitting . up tables
and piling benches, which were not, wanted. up
in corners, and only desisting from his efforts
to launch sarcastic remarks at' those of his
.helpers .who did , not' appear -properly to ap
preciate the necessity of hurry. The appear
ance of Bob Judkin, tenderly assisting to carry
on the wine, caused even the face of Mr." Tol
deroy to relax. He" cannot he said to have
smiled; Mr. Tolderoy seldom did that: it would
: be more appropriate to say ' that his features
slid Into a gentle expression and his lips
twitched appreciatively for a moment and then
were still. ,.-'â¢.
- "I've run -'round since I got "ere," whispered
Mr. Tolderoy. taking Bob aside, "an 1 they're

There's the lnjyrubber man. ar/ Saggers, thÂ»

"When are they coming?" asked Bob, who
was all Impatience. ' .

lowering his voice he added impressively. "The.

face of Mr. Tolderoy was more lengthened and
for singing, not' for marriage. She. was
their Carma, only theirs. They would
make her so happy that she would never
be able' to think of any one else..
It was only strange that she did not
hate the King: : but -whenever Bhe saw the
mark which the dagger had left, then she
sfghed softiy to herself, that the children
mÂ»ent not notice it.
But the'dagger itself she planted in the
earth and it. took root and grew, and a
splendid rose tree sprang forth from It.
as tall as a beech, so that they could sit
in Its shade and inhale the perfume of
hundreds of roses.
The book closes with an article entitled
"Carmen Sylva." In which the Queen
gives a short sketch of the Influences In
â¢ her life which have led her to do what It
has been given to no other queen besides
herself to do â to write stories which hav<Â»

amuse: and who. yet, despite all their oddi
ties, were very simple and very ordinary peo
ple af t.T allâ had . cast aside, for . an hour or
two .their strange, unrral lifeâ had come out
from the odor of sawdust and naphtha, and
had fully made up their minds to enjoy Uirm
eelves. At first, of course, ai might have been
expected. Mrs. Ulddtngs carried herself with
r certain'; stiffness to Mrs. Saggers, the fat
lady; showed her, In fact, that even though
they, might be part of the same great pro
fession one bad 1 to draw the line j somewhere.
But when once they got fairly settled at table!
with Bob at the head and Mr. Tolderoy at
the foot, and when once the first bottles of
champagne had gone down the table and up
again, even Mrs. Giddings unbent.. And then
it was that a dark scheme entered into tha
brain of Mr. â¢ Tolderoy. | i
He began to make eyes at the fat lady.
There was no mistake about it, and It was not
mere pbllteness-rdellberately. and with mal
ice, he began to make eyes at .the fat Usdy.
Lave . and wine may have | made htm reckless,
and be may have .lost sight of the fact that
tha fat lady's husband was a giant.- alike by
nature and by profession. In a word. Tolde
roy. was desperate. He drank the first toast
to the fat lady In a loud voice:
"Mrs. Saggers, ma'am, 'eres full shows to
you. an' may.^ yer flgger be as 'eavy as the
takings."
â  Mrs. Saggers blushed and giggled, and . Mr.
Saggers, (a very mild-eyed young giant was
he and weak In tho knees) looked pleased.
Mrs. Giddings looked at . Tolderoy and ,half
raised . her ' glass, but the reckless Tolderoy
kopt his eyea firmly fixed on the ample charms
of Mrs.' Saggers. Even when Bob proposed
the v health of the old show and all who
belonged to . It Tolderoy . might never ha vÂ»
met Mrs.' Giddlngs before for any look he gav*
her. -' â  '.',â 
."Tolderoy," whispered Bob Judkin in eome
alarm when the table.! had been cleared away'
and all the speeches made and they were
ready -for dancing, "Tolderoy, you'regclng
too far!" . . -â  : .
"I can't *etp It, gnv'nor.V replied Mr. Toldv
roy. "I 'ate meself for Itâ but I'm bein' soured.
It's been pent:, up for a long timeâ an* I think
that wine, must 'ave brought It out. If the
party as begins. with G dances with any ono
else. If it's so much aa a 'Sir Roger." there'll
be" murder. To see a arm 'round that waist
would be too much for me."
Perhaps Mrs. Giddlngs knew the danger snÂ«
faced; perhaps her. heart was softer even than
He fell on one knee before Carma and
implored f}ez;fo forgive him.
Â» Now, Prince Charming, having become
possessed of a throne, naturally began
looking about to find the Princess Beau
tiful to help him govern the 'country.
What more fitting and. more In accord
ance with all the Iaw8 of fairyland and
romance, than that i.e should ask the
most accomplished and vivacious Princess
In Europe to be his bride? Such. Indeed,
was the case, and they were shortly mar
ried, and entered Bucharest, the capital
of Roumania, amid such rejoicings and
splendid fetes as had rarely If ever
been seen In the land.
Immediately the young bride plunged
Into her new duties with all the ener
gy* that made her .remarkable as a girl
and young woman. She quickly learned
the Roumanian language, and by her
overflowing love and sympathy, and by
hard work, had soon completely won the
hearts of her subjects. And to-day, after
over thirty years on the throne, she Is
t. idol of all her people.
Her first book was written In a pecu
liar manner. One day the National Su
perintendent of Schools cam? to her and
said he wanted a book to offer as a prize
at the end of the year to certain Rou
manian schoolchildren, and suggested
that her Majesty write one. The, Queen
entered Into the plan with enthusiasm.
and In three weeks had written a book
of fairy tales, taking old Roumanian le
gends as a foundation for her stories.
The volume was such a success
an1 creating it Rtive the Queen such
pleasure that she turned to writ
fnjt in earnest, and volume after
volume has avpeured bearing the
nam*Â» "Carmen Sylva" on its title page.
One day in each month Is now devoted to
reading the Queen's books In the public
wchoola of Roumania and they have been

"It's a 'ot night." said Mr. Tolderoy star-

"It is. indeed. Mr. Tolderoy," replied thÂ«
lady, in a faint voice.
"You make it 'otter. Mrs. G." said Tolderoy
in the eame tone.
"Mr. Tolderoy!" remonstrated thÂ« lady

"You do, mum." laid Tolderoy. desperately/

"Well, I hope It won't move you any fur

THE CONVALESCENCE
THIrhabltually quiet, ascetic face of Seth Rivers was
somewhat disturbed and his brows were knitted as
he climbed the long ascent of Windy Hill to Its sum
mit, and his own rancho. Perhaps It was the effect
of the characteristic wind, which that afternoon
seemed to assault him from all points at onoe, and did not
cease its battery even at his front door, but hustled him
Into the passage, blew him Into the sitting room, and then
celebrated its own exit from the lone, rambling house lÂ»y
the banging of doors throughout the halls and the slam
ming of windows in the remote distance.
Mrs. Rivers looked up from her work at this abrupt
onset of her husband, but without changing her own ex
pression of slightly fatigued self-righteousness. Accus
tomed to these elemental eruptions, she laid her hands,,
from force of habit, upon the lifting tablecloth, and then
rose submissively to brush together the scattered embers
and ashes from the large hearthstone, as she had often
done before.
"You're In early, Seth," she said.
"Yes. I stopped at the Cross Roads Postofnce. Lucky
I did, or you'd bÂ«v had kempany on your hands afore you
knowed itâ this very night! I found' this letter from Dr.
Duchesne," and he produced a letter from his pocket. '
Mrs. Rivers looked up with an expression of worldly in
terest. Dr. Duchesne had brought her two children inte
the world -with some difficulty, and had skillfully attended
her through a long illness consequent upon the Inefficient
maternity of soulful but fragile American women of her
typo. The doctor had more than a mere local reputation
as a surgeon, and Mrs. Rivers looked up to him as her sole
connecting link with a v.-orld of thought beyond Windy
Hill.
"He's cornln* up yer to-night, bringln* a friend of hisâ
a patient that he wants us to board and keep for three
weeks, until he's well agin'," continued Mr. Rivers. "Ye
know how the doctor v&ed to rave about the pure air on
our hill."
Mrs. Rivers shivered slightly and drew her shawl over
her shoulders, but nodded a patient assent.
"Well, he says it's Just what that patient oughter have
to cure him. He's had lung fever and other things, and
this yer air and gln'ral quiet Is bound to Bet him up. We'ra
to" board and keep him. without any fuss or feathers, and
the doctor sez he'll pa7 liberal for it. This yer's what he
scz," concluded Mr. Rivers, reading from the letter: " *He
Is now fully convalescent, though weak, and really require-*
no ether medicine than theâ czone,' yes, that's what the
doctor calls itâ 'of Windy Hill, and In fact as little attend
ance as possible. I will not let him keep even his negro j
servant with him. He'll give you no trouble, if he can be
prevailed upon to stay the whole time of his. cure.' "
"There's our spare roomâ it hasn't been used Blnce Par
son Greenwood was here," said Mrs. Rivers, reflectively.
"Mellnda could put It to rights in an hour. At what time
will he come?"
"He'd come about 9. They drive over from Hightown
depot. But," he added grimly, "here ye are orderln' rooms
to be done up and ye don't know who for."
'â¢You said a friend of Dr. Duchesne," returned Mrs.
Rivers simply. â¢
"Dr. Duchesne has many friends that you and me
mightn't cotton to," said her hu6band. "This man Is Jack
Hamlin."
As his wife's remote and Introspective black eyes re
turned only vacancy he added quickly, "The noted gam
bler!"
"Gambler?" echoed his wife, still vaguely.
"Yesâ regularâ it's his business."
"Goodness, Seth! He can't expect to do It here."
"No." said Seth quickly, with that eense of fairness to
his fellow man which most women find it so difficult to un
derstand. "No â and he probably won't mention the word
'card' -while he's here."
"Well?" said Mrs. Rivers, Interrogatively.
"And," continued Beth, seeing that the objection was
not pressed, "he's one of them desprlt men! A regular
fighter! Killed two or three men in dools!"
Mrs. Rivers stared. ""What could Dr. Duchesne have
been thinking of? Why, we wouldn't be safe in the houss
with him!"
Again Seth's sense of equity triumphed. "I never heard
r>f his fightln' anybody but his own kind, and when he was
bullyragged. And ez to women, he's quite the 'tother way,
in fact, and that's vrhy I think ye oughter know It afore
you let him come. He don't go round with decent women.
In factâ" But here Mr. Rivers, in the sanctity of conjugal
confidences and the fullness of Bible reading, used a few
strong Scriptural substantives happily unnecessary to re
peat here.
"Seth!" said Mre. Rivers suddenly. "You seem to know
this man!"
The unexpectedness and Irrelevancy of this for a mo
ment startled Seth. But that chaste and Godfearing man
had no secrets. "Only by hearsay, Jane," he returned
quietly, 'Taut If ye say the word I'll stop his comin' now."
"It's too late," said Mrs. Rivers decidedly.
"I reckon not," returned her husband, "and that's why
I came Etralght here. I've only got to meet them at thts
depo' and Eay this thing can't be doneâ and that's the end
of it They'll Â£o off quiet to the hotel."
"1 don't like to disappoint the doctor, Beth," said Mrs.
Rivera. "We might," she added, with a troubled look of
inquiry at her husband, "we might take that Mr. Hamlln
on trial. Like as not he won't stay, anyway, when he sees
what we're like, Setn. What do you 1 think? It would be
only our Christian duty, too. 1 '
"I was thlnkln' o* that as a professln' Christian, Jane,"
Â«a!d her husband- "But supposln" that other" Christians
don't look at it In that light. Thar's Deacon Stubbs and
his wife, and the parson. Ye remember what he said about
'no covenant with sin' ?"
"The Stubbs have no right to dictate who I'll have In
my house," said Mrs. Rivers quickly, with a faint flush in
her rather sallow cheek. .
"It's your sayâ and nobody else's," assented her hus
band with grim Bubmlsslveness. "You do what you like."
Mrs. Rivers mused. "There's only myself and Meiirida
here," she said with sublime naivete, "and the children
ain't old enough to be corrupted. I am satisfied, If you arc,
Seth," and she again looked at him Inquiringly, i
"Go ahead then and get ready for 'em," said Seth,
hurrying away with unaffected relief. "If you have every
thing fixed by 9 o'clock that'll do.'.'
Mrs. Rivers had everything "fixed" by that hour, In
cluding herself, presumably, for Bhe had put on a gray
rtrcss which she usually wore when shopping In the county
town, adding^ a. prim collar and cuffs/ A pcarl*enclrcled
brooch, the^wedding gift of Seth, and a solitaire ring next
to her wedding -Tine, with a locket containing her chil
dren's hair, tweented her position as " a proper wife an 1
mother.. Ai, a, quarter to 9 she had finished tidying* tho
parlor, opening the harmonium,' ao that the light might
play upon its polished keyboard, and bringing from th?
forgotten seclusion of her closet two beautifully bound vol
umes of "Tupper's Poems" and Pollock's "Course of Time"
to Impart a literary grace to the center-table. She then
drew a chair to the table and sat down before It with a
religious magazine in her lap. The wind roared over tho
deep-throated chimney, the clock ticked monotonously, and
then there came the sound of wheels and voices. .
Buflirs. Rivera was not destined to see her guest that
night. Dr. Duchesne. under the safe lee of the door, ex
plained that Mr. Hamlin had been exhausted by the jour
ney, and. assisted by a mild opiate, was asleep in the car
riage; that If Mrs. Rivers did not object they would carry
him at once to his rocm. In the flaring and guttering
candles, the flashing of lanterns, the flapping of coats and
shawls and the bewildering rush of wind, Mrs. Rivers 'was
only vaguely conscious of a slight figure muffled tiphtly In
a cloak carried past hor in the arrfts cf a grizzled negro
up the staircase, followed by Dr. Duchesne. With tha clos
ing of the front door on the tumultuous world without a
silence fell again upon the little parlor.
When the doctor made hla reappearance it 'was to say
that his patient was being* undressed and put to bod by his
negro servant, who t however, would return with the doctor
to-night, but that the patient would be left with every
thing that was necessary, and. that he would require no
attention from the. family until the next day. , Indeed, <t
was better that he should remain undisturbed. As the, doo
tor confined his conildcnces and instructions entirely to thi
physical condition of their gue3t Mrs. Rivers found it awk
ward to press other inquiries. "Of course," she Â«ald at
la&, hesitatingly," but with a certain primness of oxpres
elSn, !"Mr. Hamlin must expect to find ovcrythlnK here very
different from what he is accustomed t6â at least from
what' my husband Eays are his habits."
, *'Nobody knows that better than he, Mrs. -Rivers," re
turned the doctor with an equally marked, precision : of
manner, "and you could not have a guest who â would be
less likely to make you remind him of it."
A little annoyed, yet not exactly knowing why. Mr*.
Rivers abandoned the subject, and as the doctor shortly
afterward busied himself , in' the enre of his patient; .with
whom he remained until tho hour of his departure, she had
no chance of renewing it. But as he finally shook Hand*'
with his host and hostess it seemed to her that he slightly
recurred to it. "I have the greatest hope of the curative
effect of this wonderful locality on my patient, but even
ettll jnore of tha beneficial effect of tho complete change of
his habits, his surroundings and their influences." Then
the door closed on the man of science and the grizzled
negro servant, the noise of the carriage .wheels was shut
out with the song of the wind in the pine tops,' and th<Â»
rancho of Windy Hill possessed Mr. Jack Hamlin In peace.
Indeed, the. wind was now falling, as was its custom at
that hour, and the moon presently arose over a hushed an.'
sleeping landscape. â¢ . /
ONE OF LIFE'S DISAPPOINTMENTS.
ONE of the funniest sights, taking, all the circum
stances into consideration, that I ever saw," said
the Eastern man, "I saw on my way over at a little
coal and water station in Wyoming.
"The station agent and a 'hand* or two loafing
around and some sore-eyed Indians seemed to comprise
the population of the place, and. the scenery was composed
of sagebrush and desolation, with a background of gaunt,
gray hills scalloped*against 'the sky.
"We were to stop there only a few minutes, Just long
enough to take on necessary supplies, but Just as this was
accomplished and /we were about to '.. start on our way
again there flashed around the spur of one of the far
distant hills a cowboy 1 , dressed in - picturesque ' Mexican
fashion, sombrero, sash, , tapajeros and all, riding a beau
tiful, clean-limbed bay horse at a merciless gallop straight
toward us. ' ,/ v
"He was waving a small white object in one hand
evidently a letter .which he: wished us to assume charge
of â and he was making splendid time. Two . minutes more
of that breakneck speed would bring him to the car doors,
and the conductorâ watching him: as we were all doingâ
THE SUNDAY CALL.
For the rest of the evening the silent presence In the
room above . affected the household; the , half-curious ' ser
vants and ,' ranch hands â¢spoke in whispers in the passages,
and at | evening prayers , in '. the dining-room [ Seth Rivera,
kneeling before and bowed over a rush-bottomed chair
whose legs^vrere' clutched by his strong hands,: included
"the stranger} within our gates" in his regular supplica
tions. When the hour for retiring came Seth, with a candle
in his hand, preceded his wife up the staircase,' but stopped
before "the door of their guest's room. VI reckon," he said
interrogatively- to Mrs. Rivers,' . "I oughter s see ef he's
waritln' anythln'?" ' â¢
"You heard what the doctor said," returned Mrs. Rivers
cautiously. At the same time she did not apeak decidedly,
and the frontiersman's instinct . of hospitality prevailed.
He knocked lightly; there was no response. He turned the
door handle softly. ThV door opened. A ; faint, clean perfume
âan odor. of some general personality rathpr than nny.pur
ttcular thingâ stole out upon > them. The light of J56th's
candle struck a'. few . ulinbs from some cut glaas and silve?,
the contents of : the quest's dresslne-case,' which hnd' been
carefully laid Vut upon a small tiible by; his negro servant.
There was also a refined-neatness in the disposition of his
clothes and effects whi<,h struck the feminine eye. of even
the tidy Mrs: Rivers ns something new to her experience.
Seth drew<ncart:r tin? \>cd with his shaded candle. aivJ thsn

For an Instant that awe with -which absolute "helpless

was visible above the bedclothes, held In. position by a; 'thin
white, r.ervous hand, and enclrcletVat the \vrl3t by a' ruffle!
Selh stared! Short brown-curls were tumbled over a- fore
head damp with the dewa of 'sleep and exhaustion. But
what appeared more singular, the cloned eyes of this vessel
of wrath' and r^ckief?sne?s were fringed with lashes as Ions

gratitude to the doctor and the helplessness of a sick man.
He now recalled the weary Journey thither,' his exhaustion
and the semi-consciousness of his arrival in a bewildering
wind on a shadowy hilltop. And this was- the place!
He shivered slightly and ducked his head under the
cover again. But the brightness of the sun and some ex
hilarating quality in the air tempted him to another Ait
look, avoiding as far as possible the grimly decorated
walls. If they had only left him his faithful servant he

Presently he saw' the^ door opening slowly. It gave ad

The child, was delighted, as lie expected. Mr. Hamlln
placed it In n fitting posture on the edge of his bed and
nurnn ostentatious paternal arm around It. ,
"But you're alive, ain't you?" he said to the child.
This subtle witticism convulsed her. "I'm a little

cheek. After "a moment she began to laugh bashfully and
with repression, yet. as Mr. Hamlin thought, a little mis
chievously.' Thcn.jus he looked Ht her lnterrogativoly, Bha
suddenly caught hold of the ruffle of his sleeve.
-"Oo'a got on' mammy's nighty!"
Mr. Hamlln started. He Eaw the child's obvious mls
tuke and "actually felt himself blushing! It was unprece
dentedâIt, was the Bhccvcst weaknessâ It must have some
thing to do with the confounded air!
-"I grieve to say you are deeply mistakenâ It Is my very
own," he returned with great gravity. Nevertheless he
drew the coverlet close over his shoulder. But here ha
was again attracted by another face at the half-opened
door-a freckled one, belonging to a boy apparently a year
or two older than the girl. He was violently telegraphing
. to j her to come away, although It was evident that he
â ..was.at the same time deeply interested in the guest's
toilet articles. Yet, as .his bright gray eyes and Mr. Ham
llh'a brown ones met, he succumbed, as the girl had, and
walked directly to the bedside. But he did It bashfullyâ
as , the girl had not. Ho even attempted a defensive ex
rlar.ation:
ently, giving strict attention to the matter in hand and
utterly refusing to allow his mind to be distracted by any
outside influences or considerations whatever. .,J.

"She hadn't oughter come in here, and mar wouldn't
let her, and she knows it," he said, with superior virtue.
"But I asked her to come, as I'm asking you." said
Mr. Hamlln promptly, "and don't you go back on your
sisterâ or you'll never be President of the United States."
With this he laid his hand on the boy's tow head, and
then, lifting himself on his pillow to a half-sitting posture,
put an arm around 'each of the children, drawing them
together, . with the doll occupying the central post of
honor. "Now," continued Mr. Hamlin, albeit in a voice
a little faint from the exertionâ "now that we're comfort
able together, I'll tell you the story of the Good Little Boy
who became a pirate In order to save his grandmother and
little sister from being eaten by a wolf at the door."
But, alas! that interesting record of self -sacrifice never
was told. For It chanced that Melinda Bird. Mrs. Rivers'
help, following the trail of the missing children, came
upon the open door and glanced in. There, to her aston
ishment, she saw the domestic group already describedâ
and to her eyes dominated by the "most beautiful and
perfectly elegant" young man she had ever seen! But let
not the Incautious reader suppose that she succumbed as .
weakly as her artless charges to these fascinations. The
character and antecedents of that young man hail been
already delivered to her In the kitchen by the other help.
With that single glance she halted: her eyes sought tha
ceiling in chaste exaltation. Falling back a step, she
called in ladylike hauteur and precision, "Mary Kmmellne
and John Wesley!"
Mr. Hamlin glanced at the children. "It's Mellndy
looking for us," said John Wesley. ' But they did not
move. At which Mr. Hamlin called out faintly but cheer
fully, "They're hereâ all rijht."
Again the voice arose with still rriore marked and lofty
distinctness. "John Wesley and Mary Em-me-Hne!" It
seemed to Mr. Hamlln that human accents could not con
vey a more significant and elevated Ignoring of seme im
plied impropriety in his invitation. He was for a moment
crushed. '
â¢ But he only said to his little friend3 with a smile,
â¢â¢You'd better go nowâ and we'll have that story later."
"After beckus?" suggested Mary Emmeline.
"In the woods," added John Wesley.
Mr. Hamlln nodded blandly. The children trotted to the
door. It closed upon them and Miss Bird's parting ad
monition, loud enough for Mr. Hamlin to hear, "Xo more
freedoms^no more lntrudingsâ you hear!"
The old culprit, Hamlin, retreated luxuriously under
his blankets, but presently another new sensation cams
over him. Absolutely hunger! Perhaps it was the child's
allusion to "beckus," but he found himself wondering
when it would be ready. This anxiety was soon relieved
by the appearance of his host himself bearing a tray,
possibly in deference to Miss Bird's sense of propriety.
It appeared also that Dr. Duchesne had previously given,
suitable directions for his diet, and Mr. Hamlln found his
simple but enjoyable. Always playfully or ironically polite*
to strangers, he thanked his host and said he had slept
splendidly.
. "It's this yer 'ozone* In the air that Dr. Duchesne
talks about," said Seth complacently.
"I am Inclined to think it 13 also those texts," said Mr.
Hamlin, gravely, as he Indicated them on the wall. "You
see they reminded me of church and my boyhood's slum
bers there. I have never slept so peacefully since." Seth's
face brightened so Interestedly at what he believed to ba
a suggestion of his guest's conversion that Mr. Hamlin
was fain to change the subject. When his host had with
drawn he proceeded to dress himself, but here became
conscious of his weakness and was obliged to s't down.
In one of those enforced rests he chanced to be near the
window, and for the llrst time looked on the environs of
his place of exile. For a moment he was stagsered.
CverytMr.fi seemed to pitch downward from the rocky
outcrop on which the rambling house and farm sheds
stood. Even the great plrcs around it swept downward
like a groen wave, to rise again in enormous billows as
far as the eye could reach. He could count a dozen of
their tumbled crests following each other on their way to
the distant plain. In some vague point of that shimmer
ing horizon of heat and dust was the spot he came from
the preceding night. Yet the recollection of it and Ma
feverish past seemed to confuse him, and he turned his
c-jhs gladly away.
-Pale,,a little tremulous, but immaculate and Jaunty in
his white flannels and straw hat, he at last made his way
downstairs. To his great relief he found the sitting-room
empty, as he would have willingly deferred hiÂ« formal
acknowledgments to Ms hostess later. A single Rlance at
the interior determined him not to linger, and h<j slipped
quietly into the open air and sunshine. The day wa3
warm and still, as the wind only came up with the golnjr
down of the sun, and the atmosphere was still redolent
with the morning splclr.g of pine and hay, and a stronger
balm that seemed to fill hl3 breast with sunshine. He
walked toward the nearest shadeâ a cluster of young
buckeyesâ and having with a certain civic fastidiousness
flicked the d,ust from a stump with his handkerchief ha
sat down. It was very quiet and ca!m. The life and ani
mation of early morning had already vanished from the
hill, or seemed to be suspended with the sunJn the sky.
He could see the ranchmen and oxen tolling on the green
terraced slopes below, but no sound reached his ears
Even the house he had Just quitted seemed empty of Ufa
throughout lta rambling length. Hla seclusion was com
plete. Could he stand It for three weeks? Perhjps It need
not be for so long; he was already stronger !v He foresaw
that the ascetic Seth .might . become wearisome. He had
an intuition that Mkj. Rivers would be equally so; hÂ»
should certainly quarrel with Melinda, and tols wouldOF JACK HAMLIN
probably debar him from the company of the children
his only hope.
But his seclusion was by no means so complete as he
expected. He presently was aware of a camp meeting
hymn hummed somewhat ostentatiously by a deep con-
Tralto voice, which he at once recognized as Melinda's.
and saw that severe virgin proceeding from the kitchan
along the ridge until within a few paces of the buck
eyes, when she stopped, and, with her hand shading her
eyes, apparently began to examine the distant fields. She
was a tall, robust girl, not without certain rustic attrac
tions of which she seemed fully conscious. This lattar
weakness pave Mr. Hamlin a new Idea. He put up the
penknife with which he had been paring his nails- while
wondenns why his hands had become so thin and awaited
events. She presently turned, approached the buckeyes, j
Plucked a spike of the blossoms with great girlish light
ness, and then, apparently discovering Mr. Hamlln, start
ed In deep concern and said in somewhat stentorian po
liteness. "I beg your pardon-didn't know I was intrud
r)on>t mention it." returned Jack promptly, but with
out moving. "I E aw you coming and was prepared; but
rer.erallyâ as I have something the matter with my heart
-a sudden joy like this is dancerous."
Somewhat mystified, but struggling between an expres
sion of rigorous decorum and gratified vanity. Miss
MeUr.da stammered, "I was onlyâ"
"I knew Itâ I saw what you were doing," interrupted
Jack gravely. "or.!y I wouldn't do it if I were you. You
v.ere looking at cue cf those young men down the hill,
"i ou foreot that if you could eee him he could see you
looking, too, and that would only make- him conceited.
And a girl with your attractions don't require that."
"Ez if." said Melinda. with lofty but somewhat redden
ing scorn, "there was a man on this hull rancho that I
take a second -look at."
"It's the first look that does the business," returned
Jack simply. "But maybe I was wrong. Would you mind
âas you're goir.g straight back to the house (Miss Jlelind.i
had certainly expressed no such Intention)â turning those
two little kids loose out here? I've a sort of engagement
with them."
"I will speak to their mar." said Melinda primly, yet
with a certain sign of relenting, as she turned away.
"You can say to her that I regretted not finding her In
the sitting-room when 1 came down," continued Jack,
tactfully.
Apparently the tact was successful, for he was de
lighted a few moments later by the joyous onset of John
Wesley and Mary Emaiellne upon the buckeyes, which ne
at. once converted into a game of hide and seek, permit
tiijr himself* at last to be shamefully caught in the open.
Bot here he wisely resolved upon guarding against fur
ther grown-up interruption, and consulting with his com
panions found that on one of the lower terraces there was
â¢i large reservoir fed by a mountain rivuletâ but they were
not allowed to play there. Thither, however, the reckless
Jack hied with his playmates, and was presently en
tconeed under a vrilloâ tree, where he dexterously fash
ioned tiny willow canoes tv.-h his penknife and sent them
bailing over a submerged expanse of nearly an acre. But
half an hour of this ingenious amusement was brought to
en abrupt termination. While cutting bark, with his back
momentarily turned on his companions, he heard a scream
er.d turned quickly to see John "Wesley struggling in the
v.ater grasping a tree root, and Mary Emmelineâno
where! In another minute he saw the strings of her pina
fore appear on the surface a few yards beyond, and in yet
another minute, vrith p. swift, rueful glance at his -white
Â£ar.ne!s, he had plunged after her. A disagreeable shock
of finding himself out of his depth was, however, followed
by contact with the child's clothing, and, clutching h>r
firmly, a stroke or two brought him panting to the bank.
Here a gasp, a gurgle, and then a roar from Mary Em
ineline. followed by a sympathetic howl from John Wes
ley, satisfied him that the danger was over. Rescuing inÂ©
boy from the tree root, he laid them both on the grass
and contemplated thorn, exercising their lungs with mis
erable satisfaction. But here he found bis own breathing
in addition to a slight faintness, and was sud
denly obliged to sit down beside them. At which, by some
sympathetic intuition, they both stopped crying.
Encouraged by this. Mr. Hamlln got them to laughing
cgaln, and then proposed a race home in their wet
clothes, which they accepted, Mr. Hamlln, for respiratory
reasons, lagging In i-icir rear until he had the satisfaction
of seeing them captured by the horrified Mellnda la front
of the kitchen, â¢while he slipped past her and regained
his own room. Here he changed his saturated clothes,
tried to rub aifay a certain chilliness that was creeping
over him, and laid down In his dressing gown to miser
able reflections. He had nearly drowned the children, and
overexcited himself, in Epite of his promise to the doctor!
He would never again be intrusted with the care of the
former, nor be believed by the latter!
But events are not always logical. Mr. Hamlin went
comfortably to sleep and Into a profuse perspiration. He
â¢was awakened by a rapping at his door, and opening it
was surprised to find Mrs. Rivers with anxious inquiries
as to. his condition. "Indeed." she said with an emotion
which even her prim reserve could not conceal, "I did not
know until now how serious the accident was, and how
but for you and Divine Providence "my little girl might
have been drowned. It seems Melinda saw it all." in
wardly objurgating- the spying" Melinda, but relieved that
his playmates hadn't broken their promise of secrecy,
Mr. Hamlin laughed.
"I'm afraid that your little girl wouldn't have got Into
the water at all but -for me â and you must give all the
credit of getting her out to the other fellow" â he stopped
st the severe change In Mrs. Rivers' expression and added
"Jtculte boyishly and with a sudden drop from his usual
vevity. "But please den't keep the children away from mo
for all that, Mrs. Rivers."
Mrs. Rivers did not, and the next day Jack and hts
companions sought fresh playing fields and some new
ftory-telling pastures. Indeed, it â¢was a fine Bight to see
this pale, handsome, elegantly dressed young fellow
loungine along between a blue-checkered pinafored girl
on cne side and a barefooted boy on the other. The ranch
men turned and looked after him curiously. One, a rustic
prodigal, reduced by dissipation to the .wine husks of"
ranching, saw fit to familiarly accost him:
"The last time I eaw you dealing poker in Sacramento,
Mr. Hamlln, I did not reckon to find you up here playing
with a couple of kids."
"No!" responded Mr. Htmlln suavely, "and yet I re
member I was playing with some country idiots down
there â and you -were one of them! Well! understand that
up hereâ I prefer the kids. Don't let me have to remind
you of it."
Nevertheless, Mr. Hamiin could not help noticing: that
for the next two or three days there were many callers
at the ranch, and that he was obliged In his .walks tc
avoid the high road on account of the impertinent curi
osity of wayfarers. Some of them were of that sex which
he would not have contented himself with simply calling
"curious."
"To think," eald Mellnda confidently tc her mistress,
"that that thar Mrs. Stubbs, who wouldn't go into the
Hightown Hotel because there was a play-actress thar,
ha* been snocpln* round here twice since that young feller
c^me." Of this fact, however. Mr. Hamlin was blissfully
Ascons clous.
Nevertheless, his temper was growing uncertain; thÂ«
ar.eie of his smart straw hat was becoming aggressive tu
Ftrangers; bis politeness sardonic And now Sunday morn*

well soaped respectability at the rancho. and the children
were to be taken with the rest of the family to the day

lonesomeness to the trails and byways, and even to invade

to- wit, a crested hawk, a graceful wildcat beautifully
marked, and an eloquently reticent rattlesnake. Mr. Ham
lin eyed them without fear, and certainly without re
proach. They were not out of their element.
Suddenly he heard his name called in a stentorian con
tralto. An impatient ejaculation rose to his lips, but died
upon them as he turned. It was certainly Mellnda, but in
his present sensitive loneliness it struck him for the first
time that be had never actually, seen her before as she
really was. Like most men In his profession, he was a
<juick reader of thoughts and faces when ho was inter
ested, and. although this was the same robust, long.
Itobed, sunburnt girt he had met, he now seemed to see
through her triple Incrustatian of human vanity, conven

For one moment or two Miss Bird only saw Jack's
long; lashes. When his eyes once more lifted they .Were
shining. "And what did you say?" he said with a short
lauzh.
"I told him he needn't be Christopher Columbus to

Jack, to be met by the word "shake," and an outstretched

frank, fraternal pressure.

as she sat down on a bculder, took off her yellow hat and
restacked her tawny mane under It, "but this: I reckoned

or wagons and DU&^es containing young couples, and to
dash ahead of sober carryalls that held elderly "members

An accomplished rider, he picked up and brought back
the v flying-parasol of Mrs. Deacon Stubbs without dls
mounting.: He finally came home a little blown, but dan
usual Sunday evening gathering at
-^jujjy H111. ranchoâneighbors and their wives,; deacons
an( j the pastorâbut their curiosity was not satisfied by
the sight of Mr. Hamlin. who kept his awn room and his
own counsel. There was sorr.e desultory conversation,
chiefly on church topics, for it was vaguely felt . that a
discussion of the advisability of getting rid of the guest
of their, host was somewhat difficult under this host's
roof, with the guest impending at any moment. Then a
diversion was created by some of the church choir prac
ticing tho harmonium with the singing of certain more or
less lugubrious anthems. Mrs. Rivers presently Joined in,
and ; in a. somewhat faded soprano, which, however, still
retained considerable musical taste and expression, sang
"Come," Ye . : Disconsolate." The wind moaned over the
deep-throated chimney In a weird harmony with the mel
ancholy of that human appear as Mrs. Rivers sang the
flr3t verse: â¢ * â¢ . â¢ â _ â  .
"Come," ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish,
Come to the Mercy Seatj fervently kneel;
Here bring your wounded hearts â here tell your anguish;
Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal!"
. A pause followed and the long-drawn, half-human sigh
of the mountain wind over, the chimney seemed to mingle
with the wall of the harmonium. And then, to their
thrilled astonishment, 'a tenor voice, high, clear, but ten
derly passionate, broke like a skylark above their heads
in the lines of the second verse:
"Joy of the desolate, Light of the. straying,
. â â  . Hope of the penitentâ fadeless and pure,
â¢ ' Here speaks . the- Comforter, tenderly saying,
â¢j \ . Earth has no 'sorrow that heaven cannot cure!**
The hymn was old and familiar enough, heaven knows.
It had been quite popular at funerals, and some who. sat
there had had Its strange melancholy borne upon, them In
time of loss and -tribulations, but never had they felt its
power before. Accustomed- as they were to emotional
appeal and to respond ' to j it, as the ' singer's voice died
away above them their very tears flowed and fell with
that voice. A few sobbed aloud and then a voice asked,
x'lt's Mr. Hamlin," said Seth quietly. "I've heard him
often hummin' things before."
There was another silence, and the voice of Deacon
Btubbs broke in harshly:
"It's rank blasphemy."
"If it's rank blasphemy to sins the praise o' God not
only better than some folks in the choir but like an angel
o" light I wish you'd do a little o* that blaspheming on
Sundays, Mr. Stubbs."
The speaker was Mrs. Stubbs, and as Deacon Stubbs
was a notoriously bad singer, the shot told.
. "If he's sincere why does he stand aloof? Why does
he not join us?" said the parson.
"He hasn't been asked," said Seth quietly. "If I ain't
mistaken, this yer ga therm' this evening was spechlally
to see how to get rid of him."
There was a quick murmur of protest at this.
The parson exchanged glances vlth the deacon and
saw that they were hopelessly in the minority.
"I will ask him. myself," said Mrs. Rivers suddenly.
"So do, Sister Rivers, so do," was the unmistakable
response.
Mrs. Rivers left the room and returned in a few mo
ments with a handsome young man, pale, elegant, com
posed, even to a grave indifference. What his eyes might
have said was another thing; the long lashes were
pcarcely raised.
"I don't mind playing: a little," he said quietly to Mrs.
Rivers, as if continuing a conversation, "but you'll have
to let me trust my memory." â¢
"Then youâ er â play the harmonium?" said the parson,
with an attempt at formal courtesy.' -..-â¢'
"I was for a year or two the organist in the choir of
Dr. Todd's church at Sacramento,' returned Mr. Hamlln
quietly.
The blank amazement n - the faces of Deacon Stubbs.
Turner and the parson was followed by wreathed smiles
from the other auditors, and especially from the ladles.
Mr. Hamlin sat down to the instrument and in another
moment took possession of it as it had never been held
before. He played from memory, a3 he had Implied, but
It was the memory of a musician. He began with one or
two familiar anthems, in which they all joined. A frag
ment of a mass and a Latin chant followed. An "Avo
Maria" from an opera was his first secular departure,
but his delighted audience did not detect it. Then he hur
ried them along. In an unfamiliar language, to "O mio
Fernando" and "Spiritu grentil," -which they fondly imag
ined were hymns, until, -with crowning audacity, after a
few preliminary chords of the "Miserere," he landed them,
broken-hearted. In the Trovatore'3 donjon tower with
"Nbn te scordar de mi."
Amid the applause he heard the preacher suavely ex
plain that those Popish masses -were always in the Latin
language, and rose from the instrument satisfied with his
experiment. Excusing himself as an invalid from Joining
them in a light collation in the dining-room, and begginpr
his hostess* permission to retire, he nevertheless lingered
a few moments by the door as the Iadie3 filed out of the
room, followed by the gentlemen, until Deacon Turner,
who was bringing up the rear, wan abreast of him. HerÂ»
Mr. Hamlin became suddenly deeply interested in a fram*
pencil drawing which hung on the wall. It was evidently
a schoolgirl's amateur portrait done by Mrs. Rivers. Dea
con Turner halted quickly by hi3 side as the others passed
outâ which was exactly what Mr. Hamlin expected.
"Do you know the face?" said the deacon eagerly.
Thanks to the faithful Melinda, Mr. Hamlln did know
It perfectly. It was a pencil sketch of Mra. Rivers' youth
fully erring sister. But he only said he thought he recog
nized a likeness to some one he had seen in Sacramento.
The deacon's eye brightened. "Perhaps the same one â
perhaps," he added, In a submissive and significant tone,
"a â erâ painful story."
"Ratherâ to him," observed Hamlln quietly.
-"How? â Iâ er â don't understand," said Deacon Turner.
"Well, the portrait looks like a lady I knew in Sacra
mento, who had been in some trouble when she was a
<?illy girl, but had got over It quietly. She was, however,
.troubled a good deal by some mean hound who was every
now and then raking up the story wherever she went.
Well, one of her friendsâ I might have been among themâ
I don't exactly remember just now â challenged him, bur.
although he had no conscientious convictions about slan
dering a woman, he had some about being shot for it, ami
declined. The consequence was he was cowhided oncj
in the street and the second time tarred and featheretl
end ridden on a rail out of town. That, I suppose, -was
â¢what you meant by your 'painful story.' But is this tho
woman?"
"No, no," said the deacon hurriedly, with a white face:
"you have quite misunderstood."
"But whose is this portrait?" persisted Jack.
"I believe thatâ I don't know exactlyâ but I .think It
la a sister of Mrs. Rivers," stammered the deacon.
"Then, of course, it isn't the same woman," said Jack,
in simulated Indignation.
"Certainlyâ of course not," returned the deacon.
"Phew!" said Jack. "That was a mighty close call.
Lucky we were alone, wasn't It?"
"Yes," said the deacon, with a feeble smile.
"Eeth," continued Jack, with a thoughtful air. "looks
like a quiet man, but I shouldn't like to haVe made that
mistake about his sister-in-law before him. These qu'et
men are apt to shoot straight. Better keep this to our
teolves."
Deacon Turner not only kept the revelation to hlmseir.
but apparently his own sacred person also, as he did not
call again .at Windy Hill rancho during Mr. Ilamlin'.*
stay. But he was exceedingly polite in his references to
Jack and alluded patronizingly to "a little chat" they hail
had together. And -when the usual reaction took placo
In Mr. Hamlin's favor and Jack was induced to actually
perform on the organ at High Town church next Sunday,
the deacon's voice was loudest in his praise. Even Pal-
son Greenwood allowed himself to be non-committal as to
the truth of the rumor, largely circulated, that one of tha
most desperate gamblers in the State had been converted
through his exhortations.
So, with breezy walks and games with the children,
occasional confidences with Melinda and Silas, and tho
Sabbath "singing of anthems," Mr. Hamlin's three weeks
of convalescence drew to a close. He had lately relaxed
his habit of seclusion so far as to mingle with the com
pany garnered for more social purpose at the rancho, and
once or twice unbent so far as to satisfy their curiosity in
regard to certain details of his profession. "I have no
personal knowledge of games of cards," said Parson
Greenwood patronizingly, "and I think I am rignt In say
ing that our brothers and sisters are equally Inexperi
enced. I amâ ahemâ far from believing, however, that
entire Ignorance of evil Is the best preparation for com
bating it, and I should be glad If you'd explain to tho
company the intricacies of various games. There ia one
that you mentioned, with â a â er â Scriptural name."
"Faro," said Hamlin, with an unmoved face.
"Pharaoh," repeated the parson gravely, "and one
which you call 'poker,' which seems to require great self
control."
"I couldn't make you understand poker without your
playing It," said Jack decidedly.
"As long as we don't gambleâ that ia, play for moneyâ
I see no objection," returned the parson.
"And," â¢said Jack musingly, "you could use beans."
It was agreed finally that there would be no falling
from grace in their playing among themselves, in an In
quiring Christian spirit, under Jack's guidance, he having
decided to abstain from card-playing during his con
valescence, and Jack permitted himself to be persuaded
to show them the following evening.
It so chanced, however, .that Dr. Duchesne, finding th-Â»
end of Jack's "cure" approaching, and not hearing from
that Interesting invalid, resolved to visit him at about thi3
time. Having no chance to apprise Jack of his Intention,
on coming to Hightown at night he procured a convey
ance at the depot to carry him to Windy Hill rancho. The
wind blew with its usual nocturnal rollicking persistency,
and at the end of his turbulent drive it seemed almost
impossible to make himself heard above the roaring of tha
pines and some astounding preoccupation of the inmates.'
After vainly knocking the doctor pushed open thÂ© front
door and entered. He rapped at the closed sitting-room
door, but receiving no reply pushed It open upon the moat
unexpected and astounding scene he had ever witnessed.
Around the center-table a dozen respectable members of
the Hightown church. Including' tho parson, were gath
ered, with intense and eager faces, playing poker, and
behind the parson, with his hands In his pockets, care
lessly lounged the doctor's patient, the picture of health
and vigor! A disused pack of cards was scattered on tho
floor, and before the gentle and precise Mrs. Rivers was
heaped a pile of beans that would have filled a quart
measure.
When Dr. Duchesne had tactfully retreated before tha
hurried and stammering apologies of his host and hostess
and was alone with Jack in his rooms he turned to him
with a gravity that wus more than half affected and said.
â "How long, sir, did It take you to effect this corruption?"
"Upon my honor," said Jack simply, "they played laft
night for the first time. And they forced ma to show
them. But," added Jack, after a significant pause, "I
thought It would make the game livelier and be more of a
moral lesson if I gave them nearly all 'good, pat hands.
So I ran In a cold deck on themâ tho first time I ever did
such a thing In my life. I fixed up a pack of cards so
that one had three tens, another three jacka, another
three queens and so on up to three aces. In a minute they
had all tumbled to the game, and you never saw such
betting. Every man and woman there believed he or she
had struck a sure thing, and staked accordingly. A new
panful of beans was brought on, and Seth, your friend,
banked for them. And at last the parson raked in. the
whole pile."
"I suppose you gave him the three aces," said Dr.
Duchesne gloomily.
"The parson," said Jack slowly, "hadn't a single pair
In his hand. It was the stoniest, deadest, neatest bluff I
ever saw! And when he'd frightened off the last man who
held out and laid that measly hand of his face down on
that pile of kings, queens and aces and looked around the
table as he raked in the pile there was a smile of humble
self-righteousness on his face that was worth double tho
money.".

More and more often Tom came home
unsteady and unnatural and after he had
fallen into a heavy sleep she would creep
into baby's cot, shivering in a nervous re

a high-spirited girl, she had said on'hear

papa, "member him about the walkir-fi
doll."
Late hi the afternoon Jean and baby
sat at the window of the little kitchen,
peering into the tenement court below, tue
child's Â«?ycs fuM *-f expectancy, the moth
er's fine brow knit into a. frown. Baby's
thrill prattle smote Jean's heart rathi-r
than her car. At dusk Jean gathered the
child to her arms, and said:
"Listen to mamma, baby. You mustn't
expect any dollie this evening."
"Won't Santa. Claus bring it?" said
baby, with trembling lip.
"Santa Claus is dead," said Jean, bit
terly.
Baby looked bewildered. This was news
too awful for comprehension, too big for
a baby's tears. With a prescience of what
was coming, Jean carried the child across
the tenement-house hall, to play with her
neighbor's children, for kind Mrs. Schmidt
loved baby as her own child.
"Is God dead, too?" whispered baby, as
her mother set her down.
"No. darling," said Jean, gently. "Don't
feel bad, dear. You have Rosie left."
Jean returned to her lonely waich at the
window, in the mournful gray twilight of
Christmas eve. Her heart was swollen
snd aching. Involuntarily her thoughts
went back to the past and dwelt upon one
whose life was clean and strong, but very
lonely because Ehe had given her heart to
Tom. If she had married John Stirlingâ
all her loyal wifehood rose up against the
thought. 6he shivered. It must be ner
vousness at the child's disappointment
that made her so weak. She would not
accuse Tom yet-^ome accident might
have happened.
But even with the thought she saw him
shuffling across the court below; one look
at his face as he entered the doorway to
come up their staircase, and she knew all.
She was standing with her comely figure
drawn to its full height, and her hands
clasped behind her. Tvhen Tom entered
the room shamefacedly. His eyes shifted
uneasily. Perhaps if he had not smiled
foolishly as he spoke Jean could have for
given him.
"Didn't mean to. Jean. Met Jim Haley.
He treated, and "
A ewordllke look from Jean's scornful
Â«yes cat short his pitiful excuse.
"Jean, I saved a quarter." he said, dep
recatingly, producing the money from his
pocket.
Jean was putting on her hat and coat.
Bhe neither saw nor heard. One consum
ing wrath for pity of her baby possessed
her.
Tom was thoroughly frightened. He
was used to reticence instead of re
proaches, but this portentous silence so
bered him.
"Jean, where are you going?" he de
manded, laying his hand on her arm.
She threw it off. Her great eyes blazed
on him until they scorched his soul. He
let her go without remonstrance. This
euperb and wrathful woman was new to
him; she was not his gentle, forgiving
Jean.
Jean Alston went out intcKthe street
Her fierce anger was not the work of a
moment: It was the culmination of the
hunger and weariness, the disappoint
ments, the heart sickness, the growing
repulsion to her husband's weakness of
the last few weeks. In her hot resent
ment that her child's joy should be sold
on Christmas eve for a glass of liquor
she had quickly made up her mind to go
to John Stirling's home. She would no
longer hide her poverty from him, but
would beg the trifling sum that would
buy the walking doll and happiness* for
baby.
She walked through the Joyous, noisy
streets, deaf to the "Merry Christmases"
pelting the air with their sweetness, un
til one struck her own ear.
"Merry Christmas, Mrs. Alston!"
She looked up with bewildered eyes
into the friendly face of John Stirling
himself. â¢
"My God, Jean! What is It?" His voice
had lost its holiday tone at sight of her
face.
"Santa Claus is dead!" she said, hys
terically.
"Jean, what is wrong? â¢ Tell me," hcÂ«
insisted. :â¢[ .-V;:
Jean's hand went up to her throat as
though she were strangling. It was
harder to tell than she had thought.
"It's that brute," ho said. "He's Lren
drinking againâ and on Christmas eve,
too."
Still Jean could not speak.
"I tell you, Jean, it's time for you to
leave him," he. said, firmly. "You have
stood it long enough. He'll not reform.
Men like him never do."
Jean made a little, gesture of gotjd-bj'!
"No; you'll not leave me yet. You must
listen," he continued. "Because you
made the mistake of marrying him is no
reason why you should throw your life
away â and baby's too."
Jean turned to him again.
"Come, walk with me and let us talk
it over," he said more gently.
There was comfort in the strength of his
friendship. It was sweet, for the mo
ment, to lean upon the strong will and
affection of her old-time lover; for so long
she had been the one upon whom a weak
er had depended. He spoke' reasonably,
delicately, of her duty to her child and to
herself. He asked her no questions of
what had happened that day; he knew
Jean's reserve too well for that. He In
truded none of his old disappointments,
none of his new hopes. He planned for
her future considerately, calmly. Jean
and baby were to come and live with his
sister, Jean's old friend, where they could
be quiet and happy. Jean might work
for herself for . a while, and then â they
went no further in words; but life seemed
to broaden out before Jean into new peace
and hope.
At parting John said, "Won't you come
to-night? Mary will be ready â  for you
and baby."
"No, no; to-morrow," she answered,
nervously.
After he had left her, she remembered
that she had not told him of baby's dis
appointment,: and for some reason which
she could not have analyzed she was glad,
glad.
She stopped for baby at her neighbor's
room, but Mrs. Schmidt told her that she
had taken the child home and put her to
bed. "Her father was there asleep, bo I
knew she would be safe," she added..
Jean entered her little kitchen. It
seemed like another woman's home, now
that she had . decided to leave it. The
room was quiet, but she could hear baby's
sweet treble from the inner room. She
opened the door noiselessly. The light
from the tenement court fell upon baby
kneeling by her little cot, with Rosie, her
ragged old doll, held tight in her arms.
Tho father lay asleep on his bed. A cer
tain vibrant tone in baby's voice, the glint
of her fine-spun hair, the droop of her
delicate head, were all her inheritance
from her father. The mother felt, with
a catch at her heart, that the little one
was not her baby, but their baby. *
"Dear God," she was praying earnestly,
"I s'pbse you couldn't send me the new
doll, 'cause. Santa Claus Is dead.' And
p'raps^you was 'frald I'd forget Rosie
if I had 'nother dollie that could â¢ walk
all by herself. " Dear God, I thank you for
letting me keep Rosie and I'll love her
very hard, 'cause she's my only dollie."
The voice broke a little.
Jean's eyes were full. The loyal littlt*
prayer was calling her back to v the fa
miliar duty and the old love. /
"Dear God," baby continued, "I'll help
Rosie to walk, so^one won't f eel ; bad
'cause she Isn't a walking doll." """
The child's. little confidence to the Al
mighty ended 'with a sleepy sob and a
tighter hug of Rosie.
Jean caught the child in her arms. "My
THE SUNDAY CALL.
blessed little savtor, my little Christ'
child!" she cried over her.
'Baby's eyes were tear wet; she, too, had
had her little struggle before reconciling
herself to the old dollie that couldn't
walk. She smiled drowsily at her mother
and with one arm round her neck and one
round . Rosie fell asleep.
Very quietly Jean arose and went to her
husband's side. He was lying like a tired
boy with one arm thrown above his
head. as 'she had often seen him after a
hard day's work. She noticed how thin
the arm was. For the first time she
realized that perhaps under his thought
lci-s indifference he had worried more
than she knew. He was young to have a
wife and a child to care for. She
found herself making excuses for him.
She remembered that it had been his
light-hearted boyishness that had first
won the love of her more serious ntaure..
The mother-feeling dormant in her wife
hood arose into full life, .sweet and
strong. A grave smile softened her fea
tures. If he .could not walk alone she
must 1 help him. God had. meant It so in
giving him to her. Well she knew there
would be much stumbling, but the
thought of- leaving him appeared to her
now as a betrayalâ she could no more do
it than she could desert baby. They
were both her children. â 
As Jean stooped over her husband she
felt a package in his pocket. She smiled
when she saw it was candy for baby.
Tnere is a golden thread of comedy glis
tening in every tragedy. She remembered
the quarter, and knew that he had had
one victory over self, however" small-
Jean placed a kiss on his forehead, the
truest and purest she * had ever given
him. He stirred a little and muttered in
his sleep, "Jean, I didn't mean to." It
was a child's pleading, and a divine
mother-love shone in her face.
By and by he awoke suddenly, a look of
terror In his face and cried out, "Jean!"
She thrilled to the note of appeal. When
he saw her sitting by his side he went on
breathlessly, "Oh. my darling. I thought
you had left me! Jean, Jean, forgive me
and help me."
"Hush, boy!" It was her old pet name
for him. "It Is Christmas eve. Let us

she Is a warm-hearted woman, yet she is

Thus the other day when she met an

be the brother of her lady-in-waiting, she
returned his military salute with a most
gracious smile and inclination of the head.
But noticing that her companion had
waved her hand in a familiar way to her

With all cur knowledge 1 and power of

we cannot comprehend. Mystery is writ
ten on every leaf, in the painting of every
flower. The astronomer may measure the

these dwindles Into insignificance com
pared with the amazlr-g condescension of
the Son of God. "It Is higher than

1. Not for personal aggrandizementâ he
was rich beyond increase; not to secure
the rich in his possessions, but forgiveness
to the debtor. Not to deliver the innocent,
hut that the guilty might be acquitted.
Not for the sake of friends, he died for his

but the wealth of Ingrates.

might be delivered from the consequences
of transgression and be Justified through
faith in h'.s name. That your feet might

news for tome people Is sometimes bad
news for others. Kut here is some good
news for every oneâ for the Chinese and
the Japanese ord the Negroesâ for all
nations. Good news for poor and rich,
for children and for old people, and this
is the message: "Unto you is born this

Christ came into the world to make
u* Christiansâ make us like himself. He
was pure and kind and full of love to
all, and it Is not easy for us to be like
him.
It has been said that we all have wild
beasts In our hearts, and it is not easy
for us to tame and conquer them. Some
times we snap and snarl and then the
wolf is in our hearts. Sometimes we are
selfish and ungrateful and then the swine
Is showing itself. Sometimes we are de
ceitful and revengeful, then it is the
tiger in our hearts. Sometimes there is
the suspiciouj. fault-finding spirit which
hunts for evilâ this is 'the vulture. To
muzzle and train these animals in our
eelves, to draw their teeth and claws and
stings, to conquer them and make them
our helpersâ this is what Christ will do
for us.
If we are like Christ we shall be striv
ing to make others happy.
One day Just before Christmas a letter
came to a postofflce directed to Mr. Santa
Claus. What should the postmaster do
with it? He opened It in the presence of
some gentlemen. It was from a little girl
asking Santa. Claus for some good things
for her father, her sick mother ani her
little brother, but she did not ask any
thing for herself. The gentlemen made
inquiry and found the family very poor,
found the little girl who showed the
spirit of Christ by seeking good things
for others rather than for herself. Christ
mas came and the needed things came
to the family, and the little girl herself
was not forgotten. '
As we give and receive good gifts on
Christmas day let us not forget to say,

gift." â¢ - .,â¢â¢â¢. ;-. :...
all her sadness and loneliness and the
nasty things the people had said aboyt
her when they turned her away from the
inn at Bethlehem, and how even the cold

cattle that bad frightened her all were
forgotten, and how glad and happy and
satisfied she was when the. little stranger
came. Then all her thought was, not
'How uncomfortable am I,' but 'How can
I make this little one comfortable?'
"And so from that very first moment
that Jesus was on earth we have been
taught that the way to be really comfort
able is to forget our own discomfort in
the care of some one else." â¢
With that, and a bright smile at part-

old man was left thinking If this Christ

and if his aches and pains 'and loneliness
would not disappear if he, too. shou'd

The great loving humiliation of the In

not communicate themselves to Ais. "We

REV. GEORGE C. ADAMS
fT^HE song which the angels sang on
I , the night when Christ was born is
. . I unlike anything the world has
i -/ heard elsewhere. No poem or prose
. . . â  of any other religion has ever pro
duced a sentence equal to that, "Glory to,
God in the highest and on earth peace,
pcod will toward men." And they sang
because the babe that was born was to
be a revelation of God's love.
We have always been anxious to know
about God ever since the time when Moses
became bold to ask, "Show me thy glory."
Men of all classes, theologians and sci
entists, are, anxious for a revelation. No
matter how skeptical men are with regard
to what others believe they would wel
come a positive revelation. It was Kep
ler who, when he was thinking out the
great laws In accordance with which the
planets move, exclaimed reverently, "O
God. I think thy thoughts after thee."
With this great longing in human hearts
to know the Creator it is no wonder that
the angels rejoiced and sung when ona
was born Into the world who would reveal
that Creator as he had never been re
vealed before.
They sang "Glory to God in the highest"
because the glory of God is his goodness.
There Is nothing selfish in his revelation
of himself to us. Our theological state
ments sometimes make him appear selfish,
but in all his revealing through the Old
Testament history we may read one long,
patient effort to lift up a people and make
them great. So the greatness of the glory
of God in this earth, is proportionate to
the greatness of the revelation of his love.

REV. F. W. CLAMPETT
IT is about thirty years ago, as the
mind recalls It, that on the eve of
Christmas great was the excitement
in the town of Waterf ord. Amid the
falling -snow and treading rapidly on
hard frozen surface, men, women and
children . were hurrying through the
streets. Holly, ivy and all the
greens of the famous Green Isle
were being carried into the several
homes. The bells of the Roman Cath
olic Cathedral were ringing their silver
' chimes.' Good will and good humor, be
gotten of national life and of bracing air,
'was the spirit of the night Room upon
room of every home was all alive with
light and laughter, berry and mistletoe.
The gladness of the day soon to tome
seemed to triumph over everything, and
every child was calculating just how far
Santa Claus would respect its wishes.
Soon came the tired, drowsy feeling of the
long walks, the careful ivy-dressing and
the "Santa Claus expectations," and then
the sweet sleep. How long? Dreams of
well filled stockings, well-drilled soldiers,
dolls and candy are disturbed by the
strains of sweetest music. It is not yet
6 o'clock of Christmas morning, but the
marching choir of our own cathedral are
filling the air with the beautiful song,
"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing, Glory to
the New Born King." The long-walted-f or
lights are struck and now the honor of
Santa Claus Is forever vindicated. "What
There are mountains of Iniquity to be

Inn. There la no room for him In some
hearts. They are already filled with
other guests, usurpers of God's place in
his own temple. No wonder the world !s
not better. The world cannot be thor
oughly Christian until the Individuals in
It are Christian, and the individuals can
not be Christian until Christ lives in their
hearts: and he will not live In any heart
with his enemiesâ with pride. Injustice,
lust and all wickedness.
These latter things stand In the way of
reformation and they all proceed from thÂ»
hearts of men. Reformation must be
from within. Good comes from the- heart
as well as evil. Make oen'i thoughts,
motives and beliefs right and their
outward lives cannot be far -wrong. Put
the spirit of Christ In their hearts and
their lives will be CbxistUie and tho
world will be Christian. "Peace," sans
the angels. "Peace on earth"â not to all
only "peace to men of good will." There
Is no peace for those of evil wtU but that
semblance or it which is deatn.
We all celebrate the feast of Christ
mas. Around the day have grown
up many customsâ some good, soma
Indifferent, some bad. The engross
ing nature of modern life has a
tendency to give a purely secular char
acter to those customs and to substitute
for the divine significance of the festival
an earthly meaning, and for Its spiritual
joys the pleasures of an earthly feast.
Our ears hear too much of the deafening
noise of business activity, or of the ab
sorbing hum ef social whisperings. Our
eyc3 see too much of the nltndjlnjr glÂ«rÂ«
of electric art or the soft glov of social
lamps. We cannot hear the heavenly
harmonies of the angels* voices nor see
the brightness of God that shone round
about the simple shepherd.
King Herod and the chief priests and
scribes ef the people of Jerusalem saw
not the Star of the Magi for the splen
dor of worldllnesa which enveloped them.

star vanishes in the coarso blaze of the

method of propagating his gospel by sac
rifice. It took this man years to see It
before he fully realized that the only
lasting power of the â  gospel must be
through love. It was because of this that
the angels sang. They knew that the love
of God was coming Into the world as It
had never been revealed before and then
they sang, ''Peace on earth."
When our'thoughts go back through the
centuries and we recall how much blood
shed there has been In the name of re
ligion we need not be at all surprised that
many teachers among the Jews instruct
the boys under their care that the Buf
ferings and persecutions that their race
have undergone are due to Jesus Christ,
but one who studies the gospel of Christ
knows well that these persecutions have
been because of the absence of the lov*
of Christ In the hearts of those who did
these things. The whole spirit of Jesus
is one of peace. He gave no authority to
his followers to persecute tho3e who dif
fered from them, and they who have so
persecuted have widely missed the spirit
of the Son of God. The absence of Christ
in his church, and not his presence In it
has been responsible for wars and perse
cutions. Christ came to bring 1 peace and
wherever he gets thorough hold of the
human soul there is peace, and to Just the
extent tha,t peace is absent from that soul
to that extent is the Son of God absent.
As the spirit of Christ wins in humanity
we see more efforts at individual and na
tional peace. The song of the angels Is
yet to be realized and peace In all the
earth Is yet to be the rule. "We can
afford to be patient while the teachings
of Jesus are gaining sway over humanity
and we can afford to live In hope- of .the
day when we shall all be brought nearer
to each other because we have been
brought nearer to our Father.

tolly to offer a bribe to the loyal guard.
After this very significant act the
g-uard'a face cleared, and he deposited
his big revolver on the table. Stepping
to the cell's entrance, he listened intent

Lorry nervously began to remove ins
clothes. In five minutes his garments
were scattered over the floor and he was
attired In the uniform of a guard. Not
a word had been spoken. The prisoner
was the guard, the guard a- prisoner.
"Are you not afraid this will cost you
your life?" asked Lorry, first in ; English.
then In German. The guard merely shook
hla head. Indicating that he could not

He Quickly turned to the bed. seized
a sheet and tore it Into strips,
impatiently thrusting Ihcrn into the

knew what was expected of him. He
therefore securely bound the guard's legs
and arms. With a grim smile the cap

tjL> lantern and the keys. His obliging
j^soner secured them, as well as his own
personal effects, and was ready to depart.
According to instructions he was to go
forth, locking the doors behind him, leav
ing the man to be discovered the next
morning by surprised keepers. It struck
him that there was something absurd in
this part of the plan. How was this
guard to explain his position with abso
lutely no sign of a struggle to bear him
out? It was hardly plausible that a tig,
strong fellow could be so easily overpow
ered single-handed; there was something
â wretchedly incongruous about the â but
there came a startling and effective end
to bH criticism.
The guard, bound as he was, suddenly
turned and lunged head-foremest against
the sharp bedpost. His head struck with
a thud, and he rolled to the floor as If
dead. Uttering an exclamation of horror.
Lorry ran to hi3 side. Blood was gush
ing from a long gash across his head, and
he was already unconscious. Sickened
by the brave sacrifice, he picked the man
up and placed him on the bed. A hasty
examination proved that it was no more
than a scalp wound, and that death was
too remote to be feared. The guard had
done his part nobly, and it was now the
turn to act as resolutely and
*Â£S unflinchingly. Sorry to leave the poor
fellow in what eeemed an inhuman man
ner, he strode into the corridor, closed
end locked the doors clumsily, and be-^
gan the descent of the stairs. He had
been instructed to act unhesitatingly, as
the slightest shew of nervousness would
result In discovery.
With the helmet well down over his
face and the cape well up, he steadily,
even noisily made his way to the next
floor below. There â were prisoners on this
floor, while he had been the only occu-.
pant of the floor above. Straight ahead
he went, flashing his lantern here and
there, passing down another stairway
and Into the main corridor. Here he met
a guard who had just come In from the
outside. The man addressed him in the
language of the country, and his heart
almost stopped beating. How was he to
answer? Mumbling something almost in
audible, he hurried on to the ground
floor, trembling with fear lest the
man should call to him to halt. He
â¢was relieved to find. In the end,
that his progreES was not to be im
peded. In another moment he was boldly
unlocking the door that led to the visi
tors' halL Then came the door to the
â warden'* office. Here he found three
eleepy guards, none of whom paid any
attention to him as he passed through
ahd entered Captain Dangloss' private
foom. The gruff old captain sat at a
ertu writing. The escaping man half
paused as if to speak to him. A sharp
cough from the captain and a significant
Jerk cf the head told him that there must
be no delay, no words. Opening the door,
he stepped out into a storm, so fierce and
wild that he shuddered apprehensively.
"A fitting night," he muttered, as ho
plunged Into the driving rain, forcing his
â way across the courtyard to the main
sate. The little light in the gatekeeper's
â window was his guide, so, blinded by the
torrents, blown by the winds, he soon
found himself before the final barrier.
Peering through the window, he saw the
*L*ez>*T dozing In bin chair. By the light
from within he selected from the bunch
cf keys he carried one that had a white
string knotted In its ring. This was the
key that was to open the big gate in case
he -was to Rive the countersign, "Dan
glcss," and trust fortune to pass him
through without question.
Luck was with him and, finding the
great lock, he softly Inserted and turned
the key. The wind blew the heavy gate
open violently, and it required all of his
strength to keep it from banging against
the wall beyond. The most difficult task
that he had encountered grew from his
efforts to close the gate against the blast.
He was about to give up In despair when
a hand was laid on his shoulder and some
one bJjsscd In his startled ear:
j^"Shl Not a ward."
-^ jij s legs almost went f rozn under his
riodv so great was the shock and the
fear" Two strong har.ds joined -Jiis own
in the effort to pu!l the door into posi
tion, and he knew at once that they be
lona/ed to the man who was to meet him
on the corner at the right of the prison
â wall. He undoubtedly had tired of the
delay and. feeling secure in the darkness
of the etorm, had come to meet his
charge, the escaping prisoner. Their
united efforts brought about the desired
result, and together they left the prison
behind, striking out against the storm in
all its fury.
"You are late." called the stranger in
his car.
"Not too late, am I?" he cried back,
clutching the other's arm.
"Xo. but we must hasten.**
"Captain Quinnox, Is it you?"
"Have a care! The storm has ears and
can hear names," cautioned the other. As
rapidly as possible they made their way
along the black street, almost a river with
Its sheet of water. Lorry had lost his
bearings, end knew not whither he went,
trusting to the guidance of his struggling
fcmpanion. There seem"ed> to be no end to
| lC j r Journey, he was gTowing weak
IJeneatb the exertion and the excitement.
"How far do tve go?" he cried at last.
"But a few rods. The carriage Is at the
next corner."
"Where is the carriage to take me?" he
demanded.
"I am not at liberty to say."
"Am I to Bee her before I goV
'That is something I cannot answer,
filr. My instructions are to place you in
the carriage and ride beside the driver
until our destination Is reached."
"Is It the castle?" cried the other, Joy
ously.
"It is not the castle," was . the disap
pointing answer.
At that moment they came upon a great
dark hulk and heard the stamping of
horses* hoofs close at hand. It was so
dark they could scarcely discern the
shape 'of the carriage, although they could
touch its side with their hands.
A soldier stood in the shelter of the ve
hicle and opened the door for the Ameri
can.
"Hurry! Get In!" exclaimed Quinnox.
"I wish to know if this is liable to get
her into trouble." demanded Lorry,
pausing with one foot on the steps.
"Get in!" commanded the soldier who
was holding the door, pushing him for
ward uneasily. He floundered Into the car
riage where all v/as dry and clean. In his
hand he still carried the keys and the
lantern, the slide of which he had closed
before. leaving the prison- yard. He could
not see, but he knew that the trappings of
the vehicle were superior. Outside ha
heard the soldier, who was preparing to
enter, say: ' . >.. â  . â¢
"This carriage travels on most urgent
business fop her Majesty, captain. It la
not to be stopped."
A moment later he was Inside and the
door slammed. The carriage rocked as
Quinnox swung up beside the driver.
"You may as- well be comfortable," said
Lorry's companion,, as ;he..' sat rigid and.
restless. . "We have a long and rough rido
before us." ' ' :
XIX-THE SOLDIER.
Off went the carriage with a dash, thÂ«
rumble of Its wheels joining In the grew
some roar of the elements. For some tima
the two sat speechless, side by side. â  Out
side the thunder roiled, "the rain swirled
and hissed, the wind howled and all tha
horrors of nature seemed crowded Into
the blackness ' of that thrilling < night.
Lcrry wondered vaguely whither they
were going, why he had seen no .flashes
of lightning, If he should ever 6ee her
again. His mind was busy, with a thou
sand thoughts and queries.;
"Where are we going?" he asked, after
they had traveled half a mile or bo.
"To a place pt safety," came the reply
from the darkness beside him. ,
"Thanks," he said, drily. "By the way,
don't you have any lightning in this part
of the world? 1 haven't seen a flash to
night."
"It is very rare," came the brief reply,
"Devilish uncommunicative," thought
Lorry. After a moment he asked: â¢ "How
tar do we travel to-night?" .
"A number of miles."
"Then I'm going to take off this wet
coat. It weighs a ton. Won't you remove
yours?" He jerked off the big rain coat
and threw it across to the opposite seat,
with the keys and the lantern. There
was a moment's hesitation on the part of
his companion, and then a second wet
coat followed" the first. Their rain hel
mets were also tossed aside. "Makes a
fellow feel more comfortable."
"This has been too easy to seem like
an escape," went on Lorry, looking back
reflectively over the surprises of . the
, night. "Maybe I am dreaming. Pinch
me."
A finger and a thumb came together on
the fleshy part of bis arm, causing him
to start, lirst In amazement, then In pain.
He- bad -not expected his reserved guard
ian to obey the command literally.
"I am awake, thanks," he laughed, and
the hand dropped from his arm.
After this tnere was a longer silence
than at any time before. Tne soldier
drew himself into the corner of the seat,
an action which repelled further discus
sion, it seemed to Lorry, so he leaned
back In the opposite corner and
allowed his mind to wander far from the
interior of that black, stuffy carriage.
Where was he going? When was he to
leave Graustark? Was he to tee her soon?
Soon the carriage left the smooth streets
of Edelweiss and he could tell, by thÂ«
jolting and careening, that they were in
the country, racing over a rough, rocky
road. It reminded him of an overland trip
he had taken in West Virginia some
mon'ths before, with the fairest girl In all
the world as his companion. Now he wa3
riding In her carriage, but with a surly,
untalkatlve soldier of the guard. The
more he allowed his thoughts to revel in
the American ride and its delights,, the
more uncontrollable became his desire to
see the one who bad whirled with him in
"Light-horse Jerry's" coach.
"I wish to know how soon I am to see
your mistress," he exclaimed, Impulsively,
sitting up and striking his companion's
arm by way of emphasis. To his surprise
the hand was dashed away and he dis
tinctly heard the soldier gasp. "I beg
your pardon!" he cried, fearing that he
had given pain with his eager strength.
"You startled me â I was half asleep,"
stammered the other, apologetically.
"Whom do you mean by my mistress?"
"The Princess, of course," said Lorry,
impatiently.
"I cannot say when you are to see the
Princess," said his companion after wait
ing so long that Lorry felt like kicking
him.
"Well, see here, my friend, do you know
â why I agreed to leave that place back
there? I said I wouldn't go away from
Graustark until I had seen her. If you
fellows are spiriting me awayâ kidnaping
me. as It wereâ I want to tell you I won't
have it that way. I must know, right
now, where we are going in this damnable
storm."
"I have orders to tell you nothing,"
eaid the soldier,' stanchly.
"Orders, eh! From â whom?"
"That Is my affair, sir!'"
"I guess I'm about as much Interested
In this affair aa anybody, and I insist on
knowing our destination. I jumped into
this thing blindly, but I'm going: to see
my way out of it before we go much
farther. Where are we going?"
"Touâ you will learn that soon enough,"
Insisted the other.
"Am I to see her soon? That's what I
want to know."
"You must not Insist," cried the sol
dier. '.'Why are you so anxious to see
her?" he asked, suddenly.
"Don't be so blamed Inquisitive," cried
Grenfall, angrily, Impatiently. "Tell me
where we are going or I'll put a bullet
into you!" Drawing his revolver he
leaned over, grasped the guard by the
shoulder and placed the muzzle against
his breast
"For God's sake, be calm. You would
not kill be for obeying orders! I am
serving one you love. Are you mad? I
shall scream If^you keep pressing that
horrid thing against my side." Lorry felt
him tremble, and was at once filled with
compunction. How could he expect a
loyal fellow to disobey orders.
"I beg your pardon a thousand times,"
he cried, Jamming the pistol into his
pocket. "You are a brave gentleman and
I am a fool. Take me where you will;
I'll go like a lamb. You'll admit, how
ever, that It Is exasperating to be going
In the dark like this."
"It is a very good thing that it Is dark,"
said the soldier, quickly. "The darkness
Is very kind to us. No one can see us and
we can see no one."
"I should say not. I haven't the faint
est idea what you look. like. Have 1 seen
you at the castle?"
He stroa* mco the corridor, closed and locked tHe doors clumsily, ana began the descent of the stairs.
'TTes, frequently."
"Will you tell me your name?"
"You would not know me by . narni*."
"Are you an officer?"
"No; I am new to the service."
"Then I'll see that you are promoted. 1
like your stanchness. How old aro
you?"
"I am â erâ twenty-two."
"Of the nobility?"
"My father was of noble birth."
"Then you must be so, too. I hopo
you'll forgive my rudeness. I'm a bit
nervous, you know."
"I forgive you gladly."
"Devilish rough road, this."
'^Devilish. It is a mountain road."
< "That's â where we were, too."
"Where who were?"
"Oh, a young lady and I, some time
ago. I just happened to think of it."
"It could not have been pleasant."
"You never made a bigger mistake in
your life."
"Oh, she must have been pretty, then."
"You are right this time. She is glori
ous."
"Pardon me! They usually are In such
adventures."
"By Jove, you're a clever one."
"Does she live in America?"
"That's none of your affair."
"Oh!" and then there was silence be
tween them.
"Inquisitive fool," muttered Gren to
himself. . .
For some time thty bumped along over
the rough road. Jostling against each
other frequently/both enduring, stoically
and silently. The rain was still falling
but the thunder-storm had lost its fury'
The crashing In the sky had abated the
winds were not so fierce, the night was
being: shorn of its terrors. Still the in
tense, almost suffocating darkness pre
vailed. But for the occasional touch
neither could have told that there wa3
another person on the seat. Suddenly
Lorry remembered the lantern. It vri'i
still lit with the slide closed when he
threw it on the seat. Perhaps it still
burned; and could relieve the oppressive
darkness if but for a short time. Ho
might at least satisfy his curiosity and
look upon the face of his companion.
Leaning: forward he fumbled among the
traps on the opposite seat.
"I think I'll see if the lantern is lighted
Lot's have it a little more cheerful in
here," he said. There was a sharp ex
clamation, and two vigorous handa
grasped him by the shoulder, Jerking him
back unceremoniously.
"No! No! You will ruin all! There
must be no light," crlefl the soldier his
voice high and shrill.
"But we are out of the city." '
"I know! I know! But I will not per
mit you to have a light. Against orders.
We have not passed the outpost," expos
tulated the other, nervously.
"What's the matter with your voice""
demanded Lorry, struck by the change
in It. . .
"My voice?" asked the other, the
tones natural again. â¢ "It's changing
Didn't it embarrass you when your voice
broke like that?" went on the questioner,
breathlessly. Lorry was now leaning back
in the seat, quite a little mystified.
"I don't- believe mine ever broke â¢ like
that," he said, speculatlvely. There was
no response, and he sat silent for some
time, regretting, more and more that -It
was so dark. . â¢. â  â¢ â .â .Â«_â .
Gradually . he* became conscious of a
strange, unaccountable presence in that
dark cab. He could feel a change coming
over him; he could not tell why, but he
was sure that some one else was besidÂ«
him, some one who was not the sol
dier. Something soft and delicate and
sweet came Into existence, permeating the
darkness with its undeniable presence. A
queer power seemed drawing him toward
the other end of the seat. The most de-
THE SUNDAY' CALL
lightful sensations took possession of him;
his heart fluttered oddly; his head began
to Â«-eel under the spell.
"Who are you?" he cried. In a sort of
ecstaey. There was no answer. He re
membered his matchsafe. and with trem
bling, eager fingers drew it from the
pocket of the coat he was wearing. The
next instant he was scratching a match,
but as it flared the body of his companion
was hurled against his and a ruthless
mouth blew out the feeble blaze.
"Oh, why do you persist?" was cried in
his ears. ,
"I am determined to see your face," he
answered, sharply, and with a little cry
of dismay the other occupant of the car
riage fell back in the corner. The next
match drove away the darkness and the
mystery. With blinking eyes he saw the
timid soldier huddling: in the corner, one
arm covering his face, the other vainly
striving to pull the skirt of a military coat
over a pair of red trouser-legs. Below the
arm that hid the eyes and nose he saw
parted lips and a beardless, dainty chin;
above, long, dark tresses strayed in con
demning confusion. The breast beneath
the blue coat heaved convulsively.
The match dropped from his fingers,
and, as darkness fell again. It hid the sol
dier in the strong arms of the fugitive â
not a soldier bold, but a gaspingr, blush
ing, unresisting coward. The litho form
quivered and then became motionless in
the fierce, straining embrace; the head
dropped upon his shoulder, his hot lips
caressing the burning face and pouring
wild. Incoherent â words Into the little ears.
"You! You!" ho cried, mad with joy.
"Oh, this Is heaven Itself! My brave dar
ling! ' Mine foreverâ mine forever! You
shall never leave me now! Drive on!
Drive on!" he shouted to the men outside,
drunk with happiness. â¢ "We'll make this
journey endless. I know you love me now
âI know it! God, I shall die with joy!"
An arm stole gently about his neck, and
her lips found hla In a long, passlonato
kiss. .
"I did not want you to know! Ach, I am
so sorry! Why, why did I come to-night?
I. was so strong, so firm, I thought, but
see how weak I am. You dominateâ you
own me, body and soul, In spite of every
thingâagainst my will. I love you â I love
you â I love you!"
"I have won against the princes and the
potentates! I was losing hope, my Queen,
losing hope. You were so far away, so un
attainable. I would brave a thousand
deaths rather than lose this single min
ute of my life. It makes me the richest
man in all the world. How brave you
are! This night you have given up every
thing for my sake. You are fleeing with
me, away from all that has been dear to
you."
"No, no. You must not be deluded. It
Is only for to-night, only till you are safe
from pursuit. I Bhall go back. You must
not hope for more than this hour of weak
ness, sweet as it Is to me," she cried.
"You are going back and not with me?"
he cried, his heart chilling.
"You know I cannot. That is why I
hoped you would 'never know how much
I care for you. Alas, you have found me
out! My- love was made rash by fear.
You could never have escaped " the ven
geance of Axphaln. I could -v not have
shielded you. This , was the only course
and I dared not hesitate. I should have
died with terror had you gone to trial,
knowing -what I knew. You will not think
me unwomanly for coming with you as I
am. It was necessaryâ really it was! No
one else could haveâ" But he smothered
the wail in kisses.
"Unwomanly!" he exclaimed. "It was by
divine Inspiration. But you will come with
me, away - from Graustark. away from
every one. Say that you will!"
"I cannot bear to hear you plead, and It
breaks my heart to go back there. But
I cannot leave Graustarkâ I cannot! It
would bÂ« heaven to go with you to the
end of the world, but I have others be
sides myself to consider. You are my god
my idol. I can worship you from my un
happy throne, from my chamber, from
the cell into which my heart is to retreat.
But I cannot, I will not desert Graustark.
Not even for you!"
He was silent, impressed by her nobility,
her loyalty. Although the Joy ebbed from
his craving heart, he saw the justice of
her self-sacrifice.
"I would give my soul to see your face
now, Yetive. Your soul Is in your eyes;
I can feel it. "Why did you not let me stay
in prison, meet death and so end all? It
would have been better for both of us.
I cannot live without you."
"We can live for each other, die
for each otherâ apart. Distance will
not lessen my love. You know
that it exists: it has been
betrayed to you. Can you not be satis
fiedâjust a little bitâ with that knowl
edge?" she pleaded, i
"But I want you in reality, not In my
dreams, my imagination."
"Ach, we must not talk like this! There
Is no alternative. You are to go, I am
to stay. The future is before us; God
knows what it may bring to us. Perhaps
it may be good enough to give us happi
ness â -who knows? Do not plead with
me. I cannot endure It. Let . me be
strong again! You will not be so cruel
as to battle against me, now that I am
weak; It would only mean my destruc
tion. You do not seek that!"
His soul, his honor, the greatest rever
ence he had ever known was in the kiss
thflt touched her brow.
"I shall love you as you command
without hope," he said, sadly.
"Without hope for either," she sobbed.
â¢'My poor little soldier," he â whispered,
lovingly, as her bQdy writhed under the
storm of tears.
"Iâ I wishâ I were aâ soldier!" she
wailed. He comforted her as best he
could and soon she was quiet â oh, so very
quiet. Her head was on his shoulder, her
hands in his.
"How far do we drive?" he asked, at
last. .
"To the monastery? We are nearly
there," she answered, In tones far away.
"The monastery? Why do we go
there?" he cried.
"You are 'to stay there."
"What do you mean? I thought I was
to leave Graustark."
"You are to leave â later on. Until the
excitement is over the abbey is to be
your hiding place. I. have arranged
everything, and It Is the only safe place
on earth for you at this time. No one
will think of looking for you up there."
"I would to God that I could stay
there forever, living above you," he said,
drearily.
"Your window* looks down upon the
castle; mine looks up to yours. The lights
that burn in those two windows will send
out beams of love and life for one of us,
at least."
"For both of us,.. my sweetheart," he
corrected, fondly. "You say I will be
safe there. Can you trust these men who
are aiding you?"
"With my life! Quinnox carried a mes
sage to the Abbot yesterday, and he
grants you a temporary home there, se
cure and as secret as the tomb. He prom
ises me this, and he is my best friend.
Now, let me tell you why I am with you,
masquerading so shamefully "
"Adorably!" he protested.
-"It is because the Abbot insisted that I
bring you to him personally. He will not
receive you except from my hands. There
was nothing else for me to do, then, was
there. Lorry? I was compelled to come
and I could not come as the Princess â as
a woman. Discovery would have meant
degradation from which j I could not have
hoped to recover. The military garments
were my only safeguard."
"And how many people know of yourâ
deception?"
"Threeâ besides yourself. Dagmar, Quin
nox and Captain Dangloss. The Abbot
will know later on, and I shiver as I
think of It. The driver and the man who
went to your cell, Ogbot, knows of the
escape, but do not know I am here. Al
lodeâyou remember himâ is our driver."
"Allode? He's the fellow who saw meâ
erâ who was in the throne room."
"He is the man who saw nothing, sir."
"I remember his obedience." he said,
laughing in spite of hi3 unhapplness. "Am
I to have no freedom up here â no liberty,
at all?" .
"You are to act as the Abbot or the prior
Instructs. And, I must not forget, Quin
nox will visit you occasionally. He will
conduct you from the monastery and to
the border line at the proper time."
"Alas! He will be my murderer. I fear.
Yetive, you do not believe I killed Lo
renz. I know that most of them do. but,
I swear, to you, I am no more T"e perpe
trator of that cowardly crime ffUua you.
God bears testimony to my innocence. I
want to hear you say that you do not be
lieve I killed him."
"I feared so at first â no, do not be an
gryâI feared you had killed him for my
sake. But now I am sure that you are
Innocent."
The carriage stopped too soon and Quin
nox opened the door. It was still as dark
as pitch, but the downpour had ceased ex
cept for a disagreeable, misty drizzle, cold
and penetrating.
"We have reached the stopping place,"
he said.
"And we are to walk from Tiere to the
gate,' said the Princess, resuming her
hoarse, manly tones. While they were
busy donning their rain coats, she whis
pered In Lorry's ear: "I beg of you, do
not let him know that you have discov
ered who I am."
He promised, and lightly snatched a
kiss, an act of Indiscretion that almost
brought fatal results. Forgetful of the
darkness, sV.e gave vent to a little
shriek, fearing that the eyes of the cap
tain had witnessed the pretty transgres
sion. Lorry laughed as he sprang to the
road and turned to assist her in alighting.
She promptly and thoughtfully averted
the danger his gallantry presented by ig
noring the outstretched hands, discernible
as slender shadows protruding from an
object a 'shade darker than the night,
and leaped boldly to the ground. The
driver was Instructed to turn the carriage
about and to agalt their return.
. With Lorry In the center the trio
walked rapidly off in the darkness, the
fugitive with the sense of fear that be
longs only to a blind man. A little light
far ahead told the position of the gate,
and for this they bent their steps, Lorry
and Quinnox conversing in low tones, the
Princess striding along silently beside the
former, her hand in hisâ a fact of which
the real soldier was totally unaware.
Beaching the gate, the captain pounded
vigorously, and a sleepy monk soon
peered from the little window through
which shone the light.
"On Important business with the Ab
bot, from her Highness, the Princess
Tetive," said Quinnox, In response to a
sharp query, spoken in the Graustark
tongue. A little gate beside the big one
opened and the monk, lantern In hand,
bade them enter. i
"Await me here, captain," commanded
the slim, straight soldier, with face
turned from the light. A moment later
the gate closed and Lorry was behind
the walls of St. Valentine's, a prisoner
again. The monk preceded them across
the dark court toward the great black
shadows against the broken mist. His
followers dropped some little distance be
hind, the tall one's arm stealing about
the other's waist, his head bending to a
level with hers.
"Is It to be good-by, dearest?" he asked.
Good-by forever?"
"I cannot say that. It would be like
wishing you dead. Yet there is no hope.
No, no! We will not say good-byâfor
ever," she said, despairingly.
"Won't you bid me hope?"
"Impossible! You will stay here until
Quinnox comes to take you away. Then
you must not stop until you are In your
own land. We may meet again "
"Yes,/ by my soul, we shall meet
again! I'll do as you bid and
all that, but I'll come back when I
can stay away no longer. Go to your
castle and looked forward to the day that
will find me at your feet again. It Is
bound to come. But how are vou to re
turn to the castlo to-night and enter
without creating suspicion? Have you
thought of that?"
"Am I a child? Inside of three hours
I shall be safely In my bed and but one
person in the castle will be the wiser for
my absence. Here are the portals." They
passed inside the massive doors and
halted. "Tou must remain here until I
have seen the prior." she said, laughing
norvously and glancing down at the boots
which showed beneath the long coat.
Then she hastily followed the monk, dis
appearing down the corridor. In ten min
utesâten hours to Lorryâ she returned
with her guide.
"He will take you to your room," Â«he
paid, breathlessly, displaying unmistak
able signs of embarrassment. "The prior
was shocked. Good-by, and God be with
you always. Remember, I love you!"
' The monk's back was turned, so the
new recluse snatched tha slight figure
to his heart
"Some day?" he whispered.
She would not speak, but he held her
until she nodded her head.
XXâ THE APPROACHING ORDEAIa
"The American has escaped!" was tha
cry that spread through Edelweiss tfie
next morning.
It brought undisguised relief to tne
faces of thousands; there was not one
who upbraided Baron Dangloss for hla
astounding negligence. Never before had
a criminal escaped from the Tower. The
.only excuse, uttered in a woe-begone
tone, was that the prison had not been
constructed or manned for such clever
scoundrels as Yankeesâ good name for
audacity. But as nobody criticized, hla
explanation was taken good-naturedly
and there -was secret rejoicing in the city.
Of course, everybody wondered where the
prisoner had gone: most of them feared
that he could not escape the officers,
while others shrewdly smiled and ex
pressed themselves a3 confident that so
clever a gentleman could not be caught.
They marveled at his boldness, his in
genuity, his assurance.
The full story of the daring break for
liberty flashed from lip to Up during the
day, and It was known all over the water
owept city before noon. Baron Dangloss
himself had gone to the prisoner's ceil
early in the morning, mystified by the
continued absence of the guard. The door
was locked, but from within came groans
and cries. Alarmed at once, the captain
procured duplicate keys and entered the
cell. There he found the helpless, blood
covered Ogbot, bound hand and foot and
almost dead from loss of blood. The
clothes of the American were on the floor,
while his own were missing, gone with
the prisoner. Ogbot, as soon as he was
able, related hla experience of the night
before. It was while making his rounds
at midnight that he heard moans from
the cell. Animated by a feeling of pity,
he opened the slab door and asked If he
were 111. The wretched American was
lying on the bed, apparently suffering.
Ho said something which the guard could
not understand, but which he took to bo
a plea for assistance. Not suspecting a
trick, the kindly guard unlocked the sec
ond door and stepped to the bedside, only
to have the sick man rise suddenly and
deal him a treacherous blow over the head
with the heavy tool he had secreted be
hind him. Opbot knew nothing of what
followed, so effective was the blow. When
he regained consciousness he was lyincr
on the bed, just, as the captain had found
him. The poor fellow, overwhelmed by
the enormity of his mistake, begged
Dangloss to shoot him at once. But Dan
gloss had him conveyed to the hospital
ward and tenderly cared for.
Three guards in one of the offices saw
a man whom they supposed to be Ogbot
pass from the prison shortly after 12, and
the mortified chief admitted that some
one had gone through his private apart
merit. As the prisoner had taken Ogbot's
keys, he experienced little difficulty in
getting outside the gates But. vowed
Dangloss stormlly. he snould be recap
tured If it required the efforts of all tho
policemen in Edelweiss. With this very
brave declaration in mind he dispatched
men to search every street and every
alley, every cellar and every attic in the
city. Messengers were sent to all towns
In the district; armed posses scoured thÂ»j
valley and the surrounding forests ex
plored the caves and brush heaps for
miles around. The chagrin of the grim
old captain, who had never lost a pris
oner, was pitiful to behold.
The forenoon was half over before Har
ry Anguish heard of his friend's escape
To eay that he was paralyzed would be
putting it much too mildly. There is no
language that can adequately describe
his sensations. â¢ Forgetting his body
guard, he tore down the street toward
the prison, wild -with anxiety and doubt
He met Baron Dangloss, tired and worn^
near the gate, but the old officer could
tell him, notl>'/>s except what be had
learned from Ogbot. Of one thing thrrÂ«
coula be no doubt: Lorry was gone. Not
knowing where to turn or what to do.
Anguish raced off to the castle, his body
guard having located him In the mean
time. He was more in need of their pro
tection than ever. At the castle gated he
encountered a party of raving Axphaln
ians, crazed with anger over the flight of
the man whose life they had thirsted for
so ravenously. Had he been unprotected.
Anguish would have fared badly at thetr
hands, for they were outspoken in the
assertions that he had aided Lorry in Che
escape. One fiery little fellow cast a
glove In the American's face and expect
ed a challenge. Anguish snapped his
flngers\ and sarcastically invited the 1n
sulter to meet him next winter in a bat
tle with snowballs, upon which the ag
gressor blasphemed in three languages
and three hundred gestures. Anguish,
and his men passed inside the gates,
which had been barred to the others, find
struck out rapidly for the castle doors.
The Princess Yetive was sleeping
soundly, peacefully, with a smile on 'aer
lips, when her Prime Minister sent an
excited attendant to Inform her of the
prisoner's escape. She sat up in bed, and
with her hands clasped about her knees
sleepily announced that she would coma
down directly after her coffee was served.
Then she thought of the wild, sweet ride
to the monastery, the dangerous return,
her entrance to the cast';; through the
pecret subterranean passage and the sa.fÂ«
arrival in her own room. All had gone
well and he was safe. She smiled quaint
ly as she glanced at the bundle of clothes
on the floor, blue and black and reÂ«l.
They had been removed in the uncer
grcund passnge and a loose gown substi
tuted, but slie had carried them to hi?
chamber with the intention of plac'n<
them for the time being in the old mahog
any chest that held so many of her child
hood treasures. Springing out of bed. she
opened the chest, cast them into ltd
depths, turned and removed the kÂ«*y
which had always remained in the locic.
Then she summoned her maids.
Her uncle and aunt, the Countess Dag
mar (whose merry brown eyes were bo
full of pretended dismay that the Prin
cess could scarcely restrain a smile), and
Gaspon, the Minister of Finance, wÂ«?ru
awaiting her appearance. She heard th*
Count's story of the escape, marveled at
the x prisoner's audacity, and firmly an
nounced that everything possible should
be done to apprehend him. With a per
plexed frown on her brow and a dubious
twist to her lips she said:
"I suppose I must offer a reward."
"Certainly!" exclaimed her uncle.
"About nfty gavvos, uncle?"
"Fifty!" cried the two men, aghast.
"Isn't that enough?"
"For the murderer of a Prince?" de
manded Gaspon. "It would be } absurd,
your Highness. He is a most important
person."
"Quite so; he Is a most important per
son. I think I'll offer five thousand
gavvos."
"More like it. He Is worth that, at
least," agreed Uncle Caspar.
"Beyond a doubt," sanctioned Gaspon.
"I am glad you do not consider me ex
travagant," she said, demurely. 'Tou
may have the placards printed at once,"
she went on, addressing the Treasurer.
"Say that a reward of live thousand
gavvos will be paid to the person who
delivers Grenfall Lorry to me."
"Would It not be better to say 'deliv
ers Grenfall Lorry to the tower'?" sub
mitted Gascon.
"You may say 'to the undersigned, ana
sign my name," she said, reflectively.
"Very well, your Hignness. They shall
be struck off this morning."
"In large type, Gaspon. Tou must
catch him if you can," she added. "He Is
a very dangerous man and royally naeda
protection." With this wise bit of cau
tion she dismissed the subject and began
to talk of the storm.
As the two young plotters were hasten
ing up the stairs later on an attendant
approached and informed the Princess
that Mr. Anguish requested an audience.
"Conduct him to my boudoir," she said,
her eyes sparkling with triumph. In the
seclusion of the boudoir she and tha
Countess laughed like children over tha
reward that had been so solemnly or
dered.
"Five thousand gawos!'* cried Dag
mar, leaning back in her chair, to em
phasize the delight she felt. "What a
joke!"
Tap, tap! came a knock on the door,
and in the same instant It flew open,
for Mr. Anguish was In a hurry. As ho
plunged Into their presence a pair of
heels found the floor spasmodically.
"Oh, I beg pardon!" he gasped, as if
about to fly. "May I come in?"
"Not unless you go outside. Ton are
already in, It seems," said the Princess,
advancing to meet him. The Countess
was very still and sedate. "I am so glad
you have come."
"Heard about Lorry T The fool Is out
and gone," he cried, unable to restrain
himself. Without a word she dragrged
him to the divan, and, between them, he
soon had the whole story poured Into hla
ears, the Princess on one side, the Coun
tess on the other.
"Tou are a wonder!" he exclaimed,
when all the facts were known to him.
He executed a little dance of approval,
entirely out of place in the boudoir of a
princess, but very much In touch with pre
vailing sentiment. "But what's to be
come of me?" he asked, after cooling
down. "I have no excuse for remaining
in Graustark, and I don't like to leave
him here, either."
"Oh, I have made plans for you." said
she. "Tou are to be held as hostage."
"What!"
"I thought of pour predicament last
night, and here is the solution. This very
day I shall Issue an order forbidding you
the right to leave Edelweiss. You will
not be in prison, but your every movement
will be watched. A strong guard will have
you under surveillance, and any attempt
to escape or to communicate with your
friend will result In your confinement and
his detection. In this way you may stay
here until the time comes to fly. The Ax
phaln people must be satisfied, you know.
Your freedom will not be disturbed: you
may come and go as you like, but you are
ostensibly a prisoner. By detaining- you
forcibly we gain a point, for you are
needed here. There ia no other way in
which you can explain a continued pres
ence in Graustark. Is not my plan a good
one?"
He gazed in admiration at her flushed
cheeks and glowing eyes.
"It is beyond comparison," he said, ris
ing and bowing low. "So shrewd Is this
plan that you make me a hostage for
ever; I shall not escape its memory If I
live to be a thousand."
And so It was settled, in this pretty
drama of deception, that Harry Anguisa
was to be held in Edelweiss as hostage.
At parting she said, seriously:
"A great deal depends on your discre
tion. Mr. Anguish. My guards will -watch,
your every action, for they are not In tho
secretâ excepting Quinnoxâ and any at
tempt on your part to communicate with
Grenfall Lorry will be fatal."
"Trust to me, your Highness. I have
had much instruction In -wisdom to-day.**
"I hope we shall see you often," she
said.
"Dailyâ as a hostage." he replied, glanc
ing toward the Countess.
"That means until the other man Is cap
tured." said that young lady saucily.
As he left- the castle- he gazed at the
distant building in the sky and wondered
how it had ever been approached in a
carriage. She had not told him that Al
lode drove for miles over winding roads
that lead to the monastery up a geatler
slope from the rear.
The next afternoon Edelweiss thrilled
with a new excitement. Prince Bolaroz
of Axphain. mad with grief and rage,
came thundering Into the city with, his
court at his heels. HJs wrath had been
increased until it resembled a tornado
when he read the reward placard In tho
uplands. Not until then did he know that
the murderer had escaped and that ven
geance might be denied him.
After viewing the body of Lorenz as It
lay in the sarcophagus of the royal pal
ace, where it had been borne at the com
mand of the Princess Yetive. he demanded
audience with his son's betrothed. a:ad it
was -with fear that she prepared for the
trying ordeal, an Interview with the j;rief
crazed old man. The castle was in a
furor: its halls soon thronged with dip
lomatists and there was an ugly sense of
trouble In the air, sugsrestive of the ex
plosion which follows the Igniting of a
powder magazine.
The slim, pale-faced Princess met tha
burly old ruler In the prand council cham
ber. He and hla nobles had been kept
waiting but a short time.

HERE'S A JOLLY
CHRISTMAS
GAME
George W. Win.ckfi.eldâ Inventor.
IN this century of racing at automobile speed to
achieve ends it seems almost more than wonderful
that anything new, under the sun, can be discov
ered, more especially in the game line; yet walk
along the streets as Christmas approaches and see the
hundred and one toys chasing along in straight lines
ar.d running around in circles; look in the shop win
dows and see the toys, entirely new inventions, and each
year it's the same thing, something brand-new from the
brain of the inventor.
Now comes a game that is one better in the checker
line.
Checkers, a? every one knows, is as old as the hills.
The Romans played squatting on stone stools in their
fchirt-sleeves, and called it by a very high-sounding
name indeed, and the Egyptians sat in the sand and bet
their sarcophagi on a single game.
There was a man named Strutt of more or less the
present day who called it a modern invention, but some
fellow came up and said that draught games are fre
qucntly found in the monuments of the ancients, and
that cooked Strutt's goose; besides, at the exhuming
of Pompeii several houses marked with checkers were
discovered.
The results, however, are the same. The grandfather
taught his granddaughter how to play the game of
checkers, 2nd she finished generally by beating his head
off and laughing at his discomfiture.
Now he will have to start in all over again to learn
this new, advanced game in order that his grandchildren
may be taught arrd once more put it all over grandpa,
v It is pretty hard on him, but he will do it, as he has
done so often before, for children and grown-ups live to
be amused, and inventors crop up all the time to help
out.
* * *
The new board is so constructed that two, three or
four people can play at the same time, the pieces being
distinguished by the colors, white, black, red and green.
When four are entered they may play partners or in
dividually.
Presuming that four people wish to play, each man
places his pieces, of which there are twelve to the
player, upon corresponding squares of the oblong mar
ginal fields.
THE SUNDAY CALIi.
The first player then move* a piece forward diagon
ally, one square at a time, from the marginal or outer
adjacent field, into the square in the center, which is tha
field of battle between the four contestants.
To take an opponent's piece you must be next to it
diagonally, and there must be an empty space behind it
I on the same diagonal. In this case the man thns
"jumped" is "taken"â that is, removed from the board.
The main object is to get over into your adversaries'
territory without being taken, which becomes at once a
â¢great feather in your cap, as it entitles yon to place a
little flag in the piece, which makes it at once a kinjr,
and he can move backward or forward as long as he
doesn't get off his diagonal basis.
The player wins who has one or more pieces on fa
board at the finish, although rules may be eventually
agreed upon for playing the game to vary and make the
same more interesting.
This new* game would appear at first sight identical
to checkers, but where four are playing, either the one
against the other or two and two, it will be seen that as
they advance, one from each end and one from each
side, great discrimination is necessary to avoid your
three opponents, if each man is playing for himself, or
you must take care to maneuver to help your partner
should you be playing sides.
The board may be of any material size and thickness,
and is preferably square. The central portion forms a
field common to all the players and is square and sub
divided, into small squares similar to a checker-board,
the squares being of contrasting color and alternately
arranged in straight lines.
The marginal fields are oblong and checkered or di
vided into squares, corresponding with the central
field.
Each of the outer fields contains twenty-four squares,
and the central field sixty-four squares.
it is compulsory to take is a matter for the
players to decide before commencing. The rule in
checkers is that if a player has a man "en prise" â which
i3 the stylish way of saying "in a hole" â and forgets on
purpose not to take, because he sees a better chance
Bext move to double up on him, his adversary, if he is
wide-awake, may do what is known as "huff" him,
which Is make him remember or capture his piece.
"Huff and move" go togetherâ that is, the player who
huffs then makes his move. >>^
There are many other rules of checkers besides thi*
one that can be used or emitted according to the choice
of the players. â¢?â¢â¢*â¢,'â¢ :! ages 33 to 46

MARCONI SOLVE PROBLEM OF SIGNALING
ACROSS ATLANTIC OCEAN WITHOUT WIRES

NOT DESIRE
NEW INQUIRY
Satisfied "With His Vin
dication by Admiral
Dewey.
Congress Not Disposed to
Reopen the Celebrated
Naval Controversy.
Py Affixing His Signature the Rank
ing Haval Officer Approves the
Whole of the Findings of
- the Court.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â Little else
than the findings of the Schley court of
inquiry has been talked about In official
circles to-day. The Navy Department
has teen a hive of buzzing -argument.
Members of Congress have dropped even
the Philippine tariff. Champions of Rear
Admirals Schley and Sampson have re
sumed their wordy battles^ on the street
corners. It may . be accepted as a strong
probability that there â will bÂ« no Con
gressional investigation.
Rear Admiral Schley does not seek a
Congressional investigation. .While de
clining to comment upon the findings, the
rear admiral's friends are warranted in
saying he is satisfied with the verdict so
far as It relates to his conduct during
the battle of Santiago. To him that wa*
the paramount issue, and all of the mem
bers of the court agree that his conduct
â was stlf-possessed. and he encouraged in
his own person his officers and men to
Ssht courageously.
Some Wild Talk. â  '.
Among excitable members of Congress'
there Is no end of wild talk and terrify
ins gesticulations about a Congressional
Investigation "which will tear to tatters
the naval clique and deal a deadly blow
ct the growth of an artlstocracy in naval
circles." r? \- '.--.
It is quite likely that some or these men
will rush to the front with resolutions,
but cool-headed members of both bodies
are not inclined to share In the undue agi
tation on a subject, which, they say, only
they can effectively dispose of.
The Navy Department will frown upon
any attempt by naval officers to further
exploit the controversy, but it would wel
come an Investigation by Congress. Lin
settled as it is, the department officials
say the investigation has been made, and
It should be regarded as closed. This is
the opinion of the court, which recom
mended that no further proceedings be
had.
Rear Admiral Sampson is in no condi
tion to testify. Captain K. E. Chadwlck,
commanding the New York, and other of
ficers of that vessel, would like an op
portunity to show that their ship was in
tha battle, notwithstanding Admiral
Dewey' s view, but they will not have a
chance.
Long Considering Findings.
Secretary Long has taken under consid
eration the findings of the court. It is
his purpose to make a careful review of
the findings of the facts and of the opin
ions advanced by Admiral Dewey, as pres
ident of the court and in his individual
capacity. When this review is completed
he will prepare an unofficial indorsement
which will be the final chapter of the In
vestigation. It is impossible now to fore
cast Secretary Long's views.
The question has been raised since" the
appearance of the two reports in print
how far Admiral. Dewcy. the president of
the court, snhscribed to the opinion ex
pressed in the first report and in the find
ings by appending his signature, that sig
nature being required of him apparently
by the regulations, regardless of his indi
vidual opinion. In response to an Inquiry
on this point the fudge advocate general
of the navy says:
"According to naval practice Admiral
Dewey by affixing his signature to the re
port of the court of Inquiry in the case of
-Hear Admiral Schley expresses full con
currence in all the findings of fact and in
all the opinions reached b'y the court ex
cept those with respect to which he -has
in terms signified dissent in his minority
opinion." ' â  ' . -
STATESMEN UPHOLD DEWEY.

Schley-Sampson Controversy.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11â Opinion In the
Senate Is divided as to the probability of
a Congressional Investigation of the
Schley controversy, but is on the whole
against the probability of 6ucb a course.
A majority of the Republican Senators
appear to be adverse to the reopening of
the question, and those holding this view
include friends of Admiral Schley. Sena
tor Hoar expressed himself as content to
abide by the opinion of Admiral Dewey
because of his superior facilities for
reaching a correct conclusion, and Sena

For some reason yesterday ""nothing was
received, and to-day we could not get the
kite up on account of the weather. It has
been blowing too heavily every day for
the balloons, which would be best to ex
periment with.
"The success of these tests will alter my
plans. I intend to suspend further tests
with kites and balloons for a short time
and eiect a large station here at z. cost
of $50,000 having towers or masts for sup
porting the wires. . This, of course, pro
vided there is no Governmental or other
objection. This will necessitate my going
back to England at the end of next week
in order to have the necessary equip
ments sent here with suitable transmit
ting machinery and other requirements.
By that time I hope to have the Cape Cod
station in working order again, so as to
complete the regular triangular service.
No doubt the success of my experiments
here will cause a sensation in telegraph
circles and many will find it dlfflci.lt to
believe It. I myself had very little doubt
as to our ultimate success, but I thought
It advisable not to communicate before
hand the exact scope of these tests, as I
considered it would be better "to assure
myself of : success before publishing; tha
details even of the Installations at Corn
wall.
Station Very Powerful.
Slgnor Marconi's station in Cornwall is
very powerful. He possesses an electric
force, generated there, a hundred times
greater than his ordinary , stations.
When certain of success Slgnor Marconi
cabled to his principals In England and
also informed the Governor of Newfound
land, Sir Cavendish Boyle, who apprised
the British Cabinet of the success of the
experiments.
Slgnor : Marconi, though satisfied from
the genuineness of the signals that he has
succeeded in his attempt in establishing
communication across the Atlantic with
out, the use of wires, emphasizes the fact
that the system is yet only in an embry
onic stage, and that the possibility of its
ultimate, development Is demonstrated by
the success of the present experiments
with incomplete and Imperfect apparatus.
as the signals can only be received by the.
most sensitively adjusted apparatus and
Slgnor Marconi is working under great
difficulties owing to the conditions prevail
ing. ' â  â  f â 'â '.-.
Distance Is 1700 Miles.
The Cornwall coast Is 1700 miles from St.
Johns.
-In view, of the success attending these
trials Slgnor Marconi will for the present
disregard -the matter -of communicating
with trans- Atlantic. steamers. He will re
turn to England: next week and will con
duct the "experiments from Poldhu him
self. He explains that the' great eljctri
cal-power there will enable him to send
more effective signals. He will undertake
this' work himself, leaving assistants here
to erect a mast. and receive the signals
as' he^ forwards them. It Is not possible
to send return signals from here until a
powerful electric battery shall have bees
installed.

FATE OF MISSING
COUPLE IN DOUBT
No News From William

Parents of Bakersfield Girl

Special Dispatch to The Call,
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 14.â The mystery
surrounding the disappearance of 'Belle
KlinÂ© and William Martin from their
homes in* this city on the 22d'of last No
vember remains unsolved. Some days ago
word was received in this city that a
brother of the missing man In Woodland
had received a letter from William Mar

Kline had been married and were in L03
Angeles on their honeymoon. On the day
en which this news was received in Ba

said that they had heard nothing of the
whereabouts of the couple.
Since the publication of the report that
Martin of Woodland had heard from his
brother, the Sheriff's office n*d received
a letter from that gentleman ?.si.ingr If it
were true that the missing couple had
been located. This inquiry, indicating tfiat
the Woodland man had received no news,
despite the report to the contrary, has

HURLS BOMB
AT HOUSE OF
MAYOR SYLVA
Assassin Attempts bo
Murder Sausalito
Politician.
Deadly Missile Hits Tree. and
Damages a Nearby
. Residence. \
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAUSALITO, Dec. 14.â Adolph Sylva,
Mayor of Sausalito and political master of
the ..town, had a narrow escape from, as
sassination last night. Some cowardly
enemy hurled a dynamite bomb at his
residence, but it struck a tree in the yard
and exploded, doing little damage to the
Sylva dwelling, while the glass in all of
the windows in the nearby residence of
Judge Bellrude was shattered. Besides
Mayor Sylva, the only occupant of his
House was his sister, Miss Florence Sylva.
That both were not killed by the explod-.
ing bomb was not the fault of the assas
sin. Had it not hit the tree it would have
demolished the house, and there would
have been little chance that/either would
escape alive. The. force of the explosion
Is shown by the fact that the tree was
torn to splinters, while that side of Judge
Beiirude's house facing the Sylva resi-
dence -was badly damaged. *
The attempt to -blow up the Mayor's
home was made at 12:30 o'clock. At that
time every one in the vicinity was asleep,
and there were no lights in the houses.
The culprit stole up to the front of Sylva'a
lot unnoticed and hurled the bomb toward
the house. His aim was good, but the
friendly tree was in the 'way, and in the
darkness the assassin threw the deadly
missile squareiy against, tne trunk.
Kesidents of that vicinity â were awak
ened. Dy a tremendous report. There was
a crash of falling glass in the Bellrude
residence and the loo trails of some one
running rapidly Irom the place could be
heard. At nrst It appeared that tne bomb
baa been intended lor the Belirude dwell
ing, as that was the more damaged, but
investigation snowed that it .nau . been 1
hurled toward the house occupied by
Sylva and his sister,
The Mayor and Miss Sylva were greatly
frightened ana there was no sleep id their
home the balance of the night, itesidenta
searched the neighborhood for. a trace of
the bomb thrower, but he had escaped. in
the darkness. Local officials have one' or
two men under surveillance, but in order
to facilitate the capture of the guilty
person they are keeping secret the knowl
edge upon which they base their sus-
picions.
The attempt to murder Sylva and his
sister may have been an outgrowth of the
trouble between the Mayor and the local
poolrooms during the summer and au
tumn. Sylva was for years the friend of
the poolroom proprietors and it was > due
to his influence tnat the gambling game
gained such a foothold In this'- beautiful
suburb. Several months ago, however,
there came a sudden change of front on
the part of the Mayor and he announced
that he would drive the poolrooms out of
the place. He made the attempt and was
defeated. The light was very bitter and
at one time the Mayor was assaulted by
an attache of one of the poolrooms, who
was later bound over to keep the peace.
Sylva has long run Sausalito politics with
a high hand and has made many enemies
outside of the gambling element. The
desperate attempt upon-hia-Hfe -indicates
that some one of his foes is determined
to stop at nothing in his desire for re
venge.
GRASS VALLEY'S
SUSPECTS FREE
Grand Jury Indicts ..\ No
One for Griffith^:
Murder. <
Mrs. Margaret Allen/. Richard
Bennetts and Toley Dur
\ gie Are Released. ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GRASS VALLEY, Oec. 14.-The greatest
surprise that has yet developed in the
mystery surrounding j the murder of Jo
ceph Griffiths, whose body was found
last week at the bottom of an abandoned
mine shaft near the dwelling of Charles
Allen, came to-day when Mrs. Margaret
Allen, Richard Bennetts and the Indian,
Toley Durgle, were released from cus
tody. All had been before the Grand
Jury, but evidently nothing sufficiently
incriminating was brought forth to war
rant that body in holding them. No one
is under arrest now In connection with
the crime. Apparently the mystery is no
nearer a solution than it was when the
body of Griffiths was found.
The release of the suspects is the more
inexplicable in view of the statements of
Sheriff Getchell, made while he was in
San Jose to tajce Mrs. Allen to Grass
Valley. The Sheriff said at that time that
the Nevada County officials were in pos
session of the confessions of Charles Al
len's two sons,' who gave evidence that
might convict their father and Toley
Durgle. . Another clew upon which the
officials were enabled to work was the
fact that a relative of Allen first revealed
the hiding place of the body, doing this
for a monetary consideration. . .
The Grand Jury has not yet finished
with the case; and arrests may yet be
made, though the outlook at present Is
that the slayer of Griffiths will never be
bought to justice.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.-Marconi's an

Willis L. Moore, chief of the United

surprise and' gratification at the news.
When told that Marconi had announced
that he had been in communication with
the British coast from Newfoundland,
Chief Moore said:
"In the first place, I. am shocked, aa

reached. - . .
Senator Hale thought there would be
and -should be no further Investigation.
He is chairman of the Committee on Na
val Affairs and aaid he would use what
ever Influence he might possess against
further inquiry as detrimental to the best
Interests of the navy.
Senator Cullom declared that further
inquiry would be tomfoolery and that no
more light on the subject should be se
cured than had been,
t Democratic Senators | generally seemed
to wait mon the expression of opinion by
the frlenus of Admiral Schley. Senator
Martin said that while he did not feel
called upon to present a declaration he i
thought that Congress should adopt a j
joint resolution stating Its confidence In
the admiral. Senator Bacon said he
would be glad to vote for a resolution;
declaring Admiral Dewey's position to be
the correct position. Senator Money as- â 
sented to the proposition that Congress
should act if action was desired by the !
friends of Admiral Schley. ( Senator Raw- !
lins thought a resolution of confidence 1
would be in order, and Senator Jones of i
Arkansas thought it most probable that ;
a resolution bearing upon the question;
was among the probabilities. j
Representative Pearre of Maryland, j
who represents the Maryland district i
from which Admiral Schley came, stated!
to-day that he would introduce a resolu- j
tion for a Congressional investigation of
the entire Sampson-Schley. affair, unless'
his colleague from Maryland, Schirm, '
who had contemplated introducing such :
a resolution, carried out this action, i
Pearre said he had not formulated the '
details of the proposed Congressional In- â 
qulry, but he thought it would be deslra- \
ble to have it conducted by special com- i
mittee, rather than by one of the regular I
committees of the House.
Chairman Foss of the â¢ House Naval
Committee declined to express an opinion
as to whether. Congress would deal with
the Schley case. He says he has been
careful to avoid taking sides on the sub*
Ject, as.lt might come before the com
mittee and he wishes to preserve a wholly
Impartial attitude. Among Foss' associ
ates it is the general understanding that
the chairman is not favorable to Congres
sional action. i Â«.â¢â â  . .
Chairman Payne, the majority floor
leader, when asked if a Congressional In
vestigation was likely to be held said:
"Why should .Congress go Into the sub
ject? Admiral Schley "has had his day, In
court, and I doubt whether. It would b<s
advisable for Congress to go over tb*
ground already covered "by the court of
inquiry." .
, Representative Meyer of Louisiana, a
member of the Naval Committee and an
authority on naval affairs, said: "I. do not
think. there should be a Congressional in
vestigation. The verdict of the ; American
people finds Its best expression in the find
ings of Admiral Dowey."
Representative Chester Long of Kan
sas said: . "If Congress could develop In
formation which the court of Inquiry had
failed to develop It might be well for Con
gress to investigate, but Congress cou'd
do no more than go over what the court
has done." '- ; .
Representative Sherman of New York
said: "I think the country will accept Ad
miral Dewey's view as conclusive, an-!
that Congress will take the same view
of It. Dewey's "conclusions will- live in
history, long' after the other members- of
the court are forgotten."
CAPTAIN PARKER PLEASED.
Says Dewey Is the Best Man to Judgs
of.Schley's Acts.
NEW TORK,rDec. 14.- r Captain Parker
of Admiral. Schley's counsel .was told
early, this mornig of the purport of >the
two Schley reports. He said: V
, "Admiral Dewey,. better than any one
else in the world, was qualified to judge
this case.* He Is the one man living besides
Admiral ,' Sehley who ' conduct ed , a cam
paign and fought a.battle withmodern
ships under modern conditions." He prob
ably feund there was a difference b Jtween
theory and practice.. and. judged Schley, lp
the Hcht of his -own experience. The, two
.other members of the court were high
minded men of the highest character, and
men who would not misjudge knowingly
or willfully. They never had the expe
rience the admiral had had, and probably
did not .see things. in the same light as he

NOTED SWINDLER
SAFE IN PRISON
John Moran Is Sent to
the New York Peni*
tentiar^v -.â 
A Notorious , Criminal Well
Kn o-wn to Pacific Coast
Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOCKPORT, N. Y.. Dec. 14.â John Mo
ran, known to the Federal authorities as
a man of many aliases, who has just
been sent to the State Prison at Auburn,
has a record for crimes committed in
Colorado and Southern California. For
several months his â¢ headquarters " had
been in Los Angeles, and later in' San
Francisco. He has given the Pension De
partment a good deal' of trouble all. along
the Pacific Coast. He appears ' to \ have
made the mistake" of his life by coming
back to the East to carry on . his swin
dling operations. .
By representing himself to be a pension
officer Moran obtained many thousands
of dollars from veterans. . He would tell
them that he had found that there was a.
doubt as to the value of their claims. He
sold his alleged evidence for large sums
in many instances. -â¢
Moran was caught at South Bend,. Ind.,
in 1898. and taken before the United
States Court at Grand Rapids, Mich.' Fed
eral Judge H. F. Stevens at that time
sent "him to-the Detroit House of,. Cor-,
rection for a short term. When he was
released he went to California,, but came
back a few months ago. He is a middle
aged man and has served terms in al
most every part of the country. His cap
ture at South Bend before he was sent
to Detroit was accomplished by sending
him a letter which he called to claim.
He was then caught by the officers and
identifled by a score of veterans whom
he had swindled.
Once while in prison Moran performed
the heroic feat of pulling all his teeth
with his own hands in order to change
the appearancee of his face. His most
roteworthy feat was the sending of an
Innocent man to prison for a term, of
eighteen years. In 1835 the Round. Oak
Siove Company at Dowaic had trouble
with its men and a warehouse was
burned. Moran was then serving time
in the New York State Prison. He wrote
to the police at Dowaic and said that the
crime had been committed by one Simeon
Ticc. Tice was arrested and convicted
by means of the letter and a chain of cir
cumstantial evidence. Moran's object
was to be taken to Michigan as a wit
ness, in the belief that once out of New
Ycrk State he could not be held for the
serious offense he had committed and
for which he was serving tlmR He failed
in this, but Tice went to the. peniten
tiary, i

Helen Post, Mental Scientist, Is Held
by United States Grand
Jury.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec 14.â The
grand jury in the United States Court
has returned a true bill in the case
against Helen Post, alias Helen Wllmans,
of Sea Breeze, Fla. The Indictment
charges that the defendant violated sec
tion 5480 of the Revised Statutes by de
vising schemes and artifices to defraud
various persons under false and fraudu
lent pretenses on her part, by represent
ing that she possessed the power of men
tal-science of mind, to cure all forms of
dsease and- weakness, for which she re
ceived money that was converted to her
own use.
The case promises to become celebrat
ed, as the Mental Scientists, at their re
cent national convention in Sea Breeze,
voted to participate in the defense of the
accused woman and -her associates. Mrs.
Post was arrested in August last, but has
been under $1000 bail. Her husband, C. C.
Post, and her son-in-law, - S.- F. Burgman,
were indicted in Macon, Ga., last month.

Special dapatch to The Call.
OMAHA, i Dec. . 14.-The Union \ , Pacific
Railroad is complaining to the courts that
it is obliged to educate the larger portion
of the children' of Western Nebraska and
Eastern Wyoming out of its own pocket.
The citizens are taking such advantage
of the law in the sparsely settled districts
that -the railroad Is obliged to shoulder
nine-tenths or the cost of maintaining the
schools. â¢ , ." i .--â > -.â }. .,â  r-
The railroad cites the case of one school
district in Cheyenne County where there
are only Mx children of school age living
In the district. They are all members of
one family, and as a matter of .convenience
the kitchen . of their home Is converted
Into a schoolroom. The teacher, is the
mother of the family and her salary is
paid by a school, tax,.' 92 -per cent, of .which
falls upon the company s right of way.-
The company would not object so much
to the .salary .if it .were Jiot for the coal
bills. . Last winter In a six' months' ' term
the district school consumed twenty tons
of coal. The. school was only supposed tf
be in session, the complainant points out;
for five daysin^the week " ahd - for five
hours each day. - ,
In seeeking relief from the alleged
hardship the company's first step was to
place an -old caboose off its wheels along
the right of way in the school district.
In this shelter one of the employes estab
lished a residence as a voter. A section
of the company's land was deeded to him
and he has brought suit as a resident and
a taxpayer .against extravagance - in - the
management of the school district. It will
be necessary to bring similar action in
other communities. > ,

Kresgre said â  that he spent the night of
May 30 at Stone Corral with Roy Miller
and Philip Miller and -never left the place
that night. Very little has been devel
oped by Kresge's testimony. He was
earful in his answers, and simply said
"yes" and "no."
Kresge said that after Frank Hall was
arrested he was not taken to the barn
on the Gilbert place, as contended by the
prosecution. He was with the arresting
party â when Frank was arrested and be
fore they got as far as the barn Hall
broke away and tried to escape.. Browrt
was not there when Hall was arrested.
Hall was not handcuffed nor tied after
his arrest or unkindly treated. After
Hall was recaptured the rope was put
around his neck to lead him, as It was
dark in the canyon and his escape would
otherwise have been easy. After he was
got out of the canyon into the open coun
try the rope was removed from his neck
and he was taken to Lookout without
trouble.
Kresge said that Brown was not pres
ent' at the time of the arrest and he
(Kresge) knew nothing of the affair until
he was asked by Constable Carpenter.. to
go with the arresting party. '
At the beginning: of. the afternoon ses
sion Post, for the prosecution, called for
witness Claude Brown, but he had been
excused by the defense, who also had
subpenaed. him, j subject to a telephonic
call. The prosecution then called Mahlon
Cannon to the* stand. Cannon said, that
he. knew W. D. Morris of Lookout and
that Morris had never made, to him any
statement such . as that testified to by
Justice- "Myers yesterday. Myers had
sworn that' Morris had said that he would
help bang- the Halls and Yantis. -
The prosecution then called Robert P.
Cortwright, supposed to be one of the
leading witnesses. 'Cortwright testified
that he saw the men hanging from, the
bridge at about 8 o'clock in the morning
after the hanging-. He knew Yantis and
the two Halls. On the afternoon before
the lynching he had seen some men in
the rope department of Trowbrldge's
store in Lookout. Justice Myers, Potter
and others were trying- loops in the rope.
He heard no talk around Lookout that
day about a lynching. â  '
Raker for the defense here ,asked the
witness how much he expected to get for
his testimony, and the court sustained
an objection.
Cortwright said that the defendant.
Brown, was not near while the men were
examining ropes. He and Trowbridge,
the owner of the store, and Brown were
standing talking together. Brown was at
the door when the witness went into the
store. .. â¢' ; .
The defense claims that in , Lookout
Cortwright had said that he knew some
evidence relative to Eades and Levanson
and that he asked C. A. Raker, one of
the attorneys for the defense, "what
there was in it for him."- This was
b â¢W out to-day, and Cortwright de
nied having made any such statement.
He also denied that he had ever told
Raker that he was "not in this country

POWER ON SEA
WILL DETERMINE
Chile and Argentina Rely
Most Upon Their
Navies!
Ambition to Dominate Is the
Real Cause of the
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
T CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.-Strength on
sea will determine whether Argentina or
Chile shall be the victor In tho war which
now Seems imminent between these two
republics. As during the war with Spain,
when the United States triumphed because
it destroyed the Spanish squadrons, so In
the war of these two South American na
tions, the navy which is conqueror will
insure to its Government absolute su
premacy.
The dispute between Chile and Argen
tina is based ostensibly upon the action
of the former Government in constructing
pathways, Argentina calls them military
roads, in territory lying between them,
ownership to which is In dispute and it
will be determined by the arbitration of
the King of England.
The real cause of emnlty between these
two countries is the ambition of each to
acquire a dominating position in South
Anierican affairs. If Cnile is the victor,
she will hold Tacna and Arlca and will
compel Argentina to pay such a heavy
war indemnity in botn land and money
that that country will never be able to
resume the important position in South
America which she now holds.
Prestige in the Balance.
If Argentina, on the other hand, com
pels Chile to sue for peace. Chile must
surrender Tacna and Arica to Peru and
her resources will be taxed to the utter
most to meet the demands which will be
made upon them. There will be in South
America a repetition of the policy of Bis
marck toward France upon the termina
tion of the Franco-Prussian war.
Upon a declaration of war Chile and
Argentina will set their troops in motion
to occupy a portion of the territory in
dispute. A decisive battle between land
forces is impossible, for the reason that
the physical conditions prohibit a military
movement until complete arrangements
have been made for effectively supplying
the invading forces. The territory in dis
pute is penetrated by a range of the Andes
Mountains, the passes of which are closed
by snow during the winter season. The
spring season is now well advanced and
military operations can be prosecuted
without regard to weather conditions. By
May, however, unless an invader has
effectually destroyed all organized resist
ance and is able to live off the country
which he has entered he must return to
his base of supplies, otherwise the passes
of the mountains will be closed and he
will be at the mercy of the defenders.
â  Armies of the Republics.
Argentina has a well-drilled standing
army of 9237 officers and men. In time
of war she has at her service a National
Guard of 471,912 men. Chile has a regular
army, one of the most effective for its
size in the world, of 9000 men. She also
has a National Guard, the total number
of men enrolled in which is 521,947. While
Chile's enrolled strength is greater than
that of Argentina, the latter country, has
a larger population upon which t;o draw.
It is the purpose of Argentina, immedi
ately upon the outbreak of a war, to order
her fleet to proceed through the straits
of Magellan to the Pacific Ocean and
there give battle to the Chilean fleet
which will be in waiting.
One unfamiliar with the situation might
regard it as possible for the Chileans to
sink the .Argentina . fleet as it passed
through the straits, but those straits are
neutral by,:agreement between Chile arid.
Argentina- and by declaration of the
United States. This Government will. not
tolerate any act which would affect Amer
ican commerce using that waterway.

Ottawa Real Estate Man Declares He
Is Entitled to Some
Honey.
OTTAWA, Kan., Dec 14.â B. W. Dowd,
a real estate dealer of Ottawa, asserts
that if ' Madame Nordica, the ; singer,
wins her suit against the Government for
a sum said to be between three millions
and four millions, 'he Â»will come in for a
stare of the money.
Â« Madame Nordica' s claim is for money
paid the United States by the French
Government for the destruction of ships
that belonged to Ichabod Norton,' an an
cestor. The money, it is said, was never
paid over to the Norton heirs. Ichabod
Norton was the grandfather of Dowd's
grandmother, according to a record in
Dowd's possession. Dowd says he has
always known of a claim that his- family
held against the Government, but, had
never made any effort to collect it.
Another Kansas heir and relative of
Madame Nordica is Mrs. J. B. Bowersock
of Lawrence. Mrs. Bowersock and
Dowd's mother were cotfslns. Dowd says
there are several other heirs in the
South.

KAISER CURBS
BEER DRINKERS
William Believes the
Liquor Interferes
With Work.
Germany Will Not Try to
Seize a Harbor In Vene
.^ zuela. â¢
BERLIN, Dec. 14.â The Emperor, among
a variety of new subjects engaging his
attention. Is looking into the relations* of
the German workmen's productiveness
and the use of beer during working hours.
His Majesty's inquiries among employers
and students of social questions Indicate
that he regards the beer now drunk regu
larly on factory premises as appreciably
detrimental to both accuracy, of work
manship and amount of product.
A movement Is on foot to exclude beer
from the ' factories because of the Kai
ser's criticisms. Several works have al
ready educated their operatives to dis
pense with the morning and afternoon
beer recesses. It is quite common for a
workman to drink ten pints of beer a day
in the shops, while the average Is not
much below a gallon per day, especially
among molders.
An American firm making electrical ap
paratus here has kept records of the work
done before and since the prohibition of
beer. The result Is 10 per cent in product
per man. Part of the increase Is due to
the time saved. The theory of the firm is
that beer drinking during working hours
makes a man physiically and mentally
inactive, and that consequently he is less
capable od doing his best work, especially
toward the end of the day.
The Foreign Office officials- announce
that Germany has not the remotest Idea
of seizing a Venezuelan harbor in order
to obtain satisfaction of her claims. Ger
many has not any Government claims,
and those connected with the mistreat
ment of sailors and Germans resident In
Venezuela are substantially settled. Ger
many might push some private business
claims, but she regards the whole matter
now as insignificant and would gladly be
out of it altogether, particularly because
of the constant misunderstanding of Ger
many's intentions by American and Brit
ish newspapers.
Baron von Kardorff has been elected
chairman of the tariff committee. The
Government desired that Dr. Spahn, the
Centrist leader, should be chairman, but
the Centrists declined to take so much re
sponsibility. Hence the Conservatives put
forward. Baron von Kardorff, who is an
extreme agrarian. Twenty of the twenty
eight members of the committee are seem
ingly in favor of the principle, of the bill.
Russian agents and German manufac
turers are getting much material for use
in agitating against the tariff measure.
The influential Muenchener JUlgemein
Zeitung (National Liberal), noting that
the imports of American writing and cal
culating machines are largely Increasing,
the imports of the latter alone amounting
to 2,750,000 marks from January to Octo
ber, urges quadrupling the duties on these
machines. The new tariff increases the
duties from 24 to 60 marks per metric hun
dredweight.
Inquiries made among the textile manu
facturers of the Frieburg district with
reference to the shortage of the Ameri
can cotton crop indicate that they much
doubt that the United States crop la real
ly short, but they add that if the report
Is true It will mean disaster to the cotton
industry of Germany, which is already
working on reduced time. Some manufac
turers say that even the short crop of
cotton may be found -sufficient for the de
mands of an already dull market. The
supply of cotton In Germany will suffice
for two months. . â - . . . - -. â

CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
CHRISTMAS shopping is naturally begun in a
holiday spirit. The people go forth first to take
a look around the shops to see what is offered
in the way of novelties. For a time there are
more of these sightseers than of purchasers. Every great
store is thronged with gay crowds, and the- animation of
the scene is such ss: to give tlie appearance of a bazaar
rather than an ordinary place of business. It is quite right
that this should be so. The Christmas world must see be
fore it can buy, and since there is a -delight in the seeing,
there is no reason why any one should object to the coming
and going of the crowds .making the preliminary rounds
of the shops.
Every custom, however, is liable to corruption, and
everything that has a right use may be subject to abuse.
Many of the people who run about from one shop to an
other will find it more and more difficult to make up their
minds what to purchase'. Instead of profiting by the mul
titude of things they see they will really become somewhat
bewildered by them and then will ensue a period of aim
less wandering from one place to another in search of
something they know not what. To such people the holi
day shopping in the end will become more perplexing
than pleasant. They will postpone purchasing from day
to dav and Christmas eve will come to find the whole host
of them struggling, and scuffling with one another in
jammed and crowded shops trying to get anything at all
that will do for gifts of the Christmas day.
That sort of thing has been so common in the United
States, where Christmas giving is carried out upon a much
more extensive and more costly scale than anywhere else,
that bur merchants have tried to provide a remedy for it
by offering their Christmas sales weeks in advance and
attracting attention to them by splendid . displays in the
show-windows. Under the present system it is quite pos
sible for all classes to make a careful inspection oi the
stores and complete their Christmas purchasing without
hurry and without delay. In this city and at this season,
for example, nearly the whole volume of gift purchasing
might be done during this week, leaving next week tree
for an easy preparation for the coming of the great day.
It should be borne in mind that there are a large num
ber of people in this city whose work confines them to
their places of business during the day and who therefore
can hardly make purchases until the evening. It is there
fore but a fair exercise ot the courtesies of the season that
all who have time to do so should make their inspection
and their purchases during the forenoon or afternoon, leav
ing the evening for the workers. Those who follow that
rule will not only have a pleasanter shopping season
themselves, but will have the satisfaction of feeling that
they have, shown a consideration for others.
Finally in all gift giving of the time the rich should
remember the poor.
IN HISTRIONIC WORLD
HERE we are again!
That seems to be what the
delicately, expansive smile of the
long lost Ferris Hartman, that
one meets on the streets these
days, is remarking. It's, a good
Christmas face, promising well for the
only Christmas entertainment proper that
the town affords, "Little Bed Riding
Hood" at the Tivoli, so please you, to
enter on Its seasonable career to-morrow
evening.
All the old Tivoll favorites are at home
again, and glad to be home, after an ab
sence of four long months, and most of
the familiar faces will be seen to-morrow
night in "Little Red Riding Hood." Mr.
Hartman has written the book, originally
with a star Dart all for himself in the
title role, but he has unselfishly given
it up after much persuasion to Miss
Chapman, though he says regretfully: "I
did look too cute for anything ln that
fwect little red hood, don't cher know?"
He has annexed the next best role, how
ever, as King Fire Fly, who gets trans
mogrified by a bad fairy for six scenes
and various rAns into Simple Simon, who
wears the turned-down collar and turned
up nose that suit Mr. Hartman's ingen
uous countenance so divinely. Lest we
forget, all that history has to say touch
ing this sweet young life Is given here be
low:
Simple Simon met a pieman.
Going to the fair.
Fays Simple Slrron to the plcaan.
Let me taste your -ware.
Sejs the pieman to Simple Simon.
First show me your penny;
Says Simple Simoa to the pieman.
Indeed. I have not any*
It will at once be seen how the sweet
and simple pathos of the character ac
cords with the best-known characteristics
of Mr. Hartman's genius, and one of his
BCbtlest impersonations may confidently
be looked for. It is a significant circum
stance. I don't know why, but feel in my
bones its weird significance, that the pie
man is not in the cast up-to-date. O
where, O where can he be? Perhaps lie
has fallen a victim to Fred Kavanagh.
who has been training for the wolf in the
cast. For I imagine a nice, tender pie
man would make much better eating than
Harry Cashman, v/ho will play little Red
Riding Hood's maternal grandparent. But
what is the matter with Fled Hiding Hood
herself, if the story permitted, or plump
little Annie Myers, who wanders in from
another page of fairyland as Boy Blue?
But there is always a fairy queen to the
rescue, and this year she is named Bar
r.etta Mueller, the pretty young woman
who tried to sing Nedda and couldn't
during the grand opera season. I'm sure
she will make a pretty fairy queen
though, and she has a large staff of as
sistant fairies that help along the good
work. It will take them all, every one,
to confound the wicked plots and machin
ations of Edward Webb as Baron Rub
berneck, and to see that Prince True
Blue's (Arthur Cunningham) affairs are
settled up to his princely deserts. Little
Miss Muffett also peeps into the story,
and other historical eminences too num
erous to mention.
There are to be ballets galore, a snow
ballet in particular, with a snow gentle
manânot the icemanâ to run matters, and
Er.owballs and icicles and all sorts of nice
Christmas cardy things to look at. The
transformation scene will be a wonder,
with illustrations from twelve of Mother
Xjcose's epics, "Boy Blue," "The Old Wo
man Who Lived in a Shoe," "Ding, Dong,
Bell," "Mary, Mary. Quite Contrary"
and "The Cow Jumped Over the Moon"
among them. It looks something like a
"merry Christmas" when the Tivoli gets
to work at its Christmas show, and it 13
likely that all the compliments of the sea
son will be in order to-morrow night
when it begins. Tha same to you and
many of them.
Though opera of the grand sort has
"been and gone and left" lis for
another year, the comic kind ' is
still booming. and with Jefferson
de Angelis ' in "A Royal Rogue" at
the Columbia has done much to enliven
tho dramatic tedium of the last week. "A
Royal Rogue" is an opera of no lmpor
tai ce, only ln so far as It serves De An
gelis with a medium to get on the stage.
He is ridiculously funny, that kind of fun
that defies analysis, ' and convulses while
you wait. You cannot give any Intelligible
reason for your convulsions, for to , say
that you howled because a comedian came
downstairs with one foot on the balus
trade and the other on the steps, simply
reflects doubt on your sanity and throws
no light on your subject. But it Is fun,
genuine, palpable, compelling, that De
Angelis gives you, funâ horse-play, if you
willâ that requires no opera-glasses to see

CERTAIN of the clergy persist in despairing of
the human race. They are pessimistic to a degree
unknown since the days of Jeremiah, the weep
ing prophet. If one fail to bring to the aid of
his cheerfulness- of -spirit the knowledge that the re
searches of scholarship have brought within the reach of
inquiry, the mournful view of the race indulged in by cer
tain of its spiritual guides is conducive to the blues.
It is quite remarkable that this clerical pessimism
seems to have its center in Missouri and Kansas. We have
commented already upon the remarks of one clergyman
of that region, and now another, an eminent Presbyterian
divine, preaching from Revelation xxi:5, expresses the
opinion that man has deteriorated mentally, morally and
physically since the creation, . and that "The only differ
ence apparent is that now, in these days of civilization, he
is a polished assassin instead of a proclaimed barbarian."
In further evidence of his position he implored his
hearers to note the fact that every great man from the
statesman to the poet was a. being of the past. Finally: in
utter despair of doing anything to better affairs, ho an
nounced: "We are living in the last stage of the world's
existence. Man will grow so wicked that Providence will
not be able to stand his binning any longer, and wil' de
stroy the world. God will then make his children white as
snow by making all things new."
As a part of mankind we must protest against going
to execution on a judgment entered against Missouri and
Kansas. Why should the divine besom sweep Florence
Nightingale and Miss Clara Barton into the fire because
a Missouri lady is under indictment for murdering her
husband on Christmas eve, and a Kansas young lady cut
the throat of her rival with a razor?
The creation, spoken of by the clergyman, was a dif
ferent process from that which he has in mind. Life was
created in the mud slimes, and advanced through various
forms to man, who., since he arose from all fours, has been
doing the best he can. He never was as strong mentally
as now. He used to hide shuddering in caves from !hun
der and the eclipse. Now he controls the lightning, meas
ures space to the stars and analyzes the solids which com
pose them and the guses which envelop them.
His improved mentality and its processes have an
swered the physical riddles of the universe, and in the
process the creative Providence has acquired a dignity and
is panoplied in a majesty unknown\in what are cnlled
"the ages of faith."
Nor is it true that man has deteriorated physically.
it, and to which even the least humorous
ly inclined folk must give eye and ear.
There is no one else in the company but
Henry Norman; who sings a good song,
but De Angelis is sufficient unto the day
thereof, and he Is good for another week.
Following him comes the charming
Mary Mannering in "Janice Meredith,"
that will be the Columbia's holiday at
traction.
â¢To-night at the California there is the
curious and classic conjunction of a
Jefferson and "Rip Van Winkle." Still
more curious, the Jefferson is the son of
the famous actor, so long, identified' with
the play, and he comes here, with , the
company . in which his celebrated â¢ sire
played so long his part." It would-be yet
more curious if he turned out to be a
second Joe Jefferson in â  the :> part. â  ,
MAN'S DESPAIR OF MEN.
THREE CLEVER LITTLE MU
SICIANS OF AN AUSTRALIAN
.COMPANY.
,The physical status of all life is determined by the period
through which it endures. The life of man' is longer to-day
than it ever was.' It has had years added to it in the last
three centuries, and the child born to-day is promised lon
gevity greater than that of its father. This is not-specu
lative. It is exact and indisputable! As for mental
greatness of the past, it depends . greatly upon the per
spective. Homer is greater to this than to his own genera
tion. The worthies of the Augustan age had little credit
in their day, and as for those of the Elizabethan age. who
were less noted than Shakespeare and Benjonson? The
proof of the expansion of the human mind is found in its
present capacity to comprehend and appreciate and apply
the high invention of Homer, Virgil and Shakespeare.
No doubt there are in this advanced and improved
world for which -the preacher finds no better fate than de
struction minds' as much above the witsÂ«of this genera
tion as were these ancients beyond the comprehension of
theirs, and who in like manner will wait for recognition by
the continually growing mind of man.
It is a common infirmity to look. fondly back upon
"the good old times." But they were no better than these.
Abraham would be lynched if he treated his wife Sarah
now as he did when he enjoyed the favor of Providence.
And as for David, there is not a modern people that would
tolerate him, and; his son Solomon would be sent to the
penitentiary for violation of the Tucker-Edmunds law.
All over the modern world .morality, personal and
public, has improved in the last century.
An autograph letter written by Lady Montagu, wife
of an English admiral, was sold in New York recently. In
it the lady described a supper she had attended in polite
society. She said: "On my conscience, everybody was
drunk, for we were. a. good company, apd it was the best
supper I ever supt at."
In the same letter, describing. London society, she
says: "The ladies turn night into day. They paint, and
pinch their bodies in tight stays till they sink; for to be
very small at bottom and hanging over at top is quite the
fashion. Amongst them inconstancy, the fashion; sepa
ration, the fashion; to be with anybody but your husband
at the too of the fashion." â¢
There is not to-day* on the face of the earth a society
of which any, of these things is true.
The clergy should be encouraged to study other
books' of knowledge than dogmatic theology,' and a wider
wisdom may open their eyes to . see among the children
of men a vast multitude that are already whiter than snow.
THE CLEVER PASMORES
P, ERHAPS there 'is no imperative
I artistic reason why the Pasmore
v children should be on the concert
platform, but to the thoughtful
person there Is that. in their per
formance that is distinctly pleasing from
many standpoints. I heard them play the
other evening at Maple Hall, after a con
siderable lapse' of time, and wish to record
an unusual gratification in listening to
their efforts. To begin with there is an
entire . absence . of anything approaching
the abnormal, precocious element in their
work, that exotic emotional development
that makes the ordinary platform child
an object for i deepest pity. On the con
trary, theirs is a wholesome, normal and
childlike effort, ; evincing a' reasonable
amount of temperament, a capacity for
earnest and sincere study and a natural
development along sound and sale lines.
THE COLD WAVE.
V "* T HILE to most people the frosty air of the last
\ A / few days has been welcome as sunshine in
V/V spring because it harmonized so well with the
â¼ â¼ Christmas season, to a good many persons it
has been anything but pleasant. How much damage may
have been done by it to the fruit-growers cannot as
vet be estimated. It is certain, however, that California
has not had the pleasure of this -fine bracing weather"
without paying for it. Like every other good thing, it
comes high. . -
A remarkable feature of the cold snap is the extent of
the wave which produced it. Apparently the entire con
tinent has been swept by it, and in many Eastern locali
ties it has been cold enough to count as a genuine dis
aster Over the Mississippi Valley the wave extended as
far south as the Arkansas boundary, and along the Great
Lakes it was severe enough in many localities to cause
death where persons were exposed to it. Eastern repot??
speak of quite a number of such fatalities, for the people
were not expecting so cold a wave thus early in the win
ter and were not prepared for it.
It is seldom the weather on this coast coincides with
that on the east. When we have heavy frosts here the
weather on the other side of the continent is generally
milder than is usual at that season, and the same rule holds
good with hot waves. This present coincidence of cold on
both sides of the continent is therefore sufficiently unusual
to be notable, and will doubtless engage the attention of
the Weather Bureau.
From the reports that come to us from the East we
can gather one more evidence of the superiority of our
climate. Here the golden mean of weather prevails nearly
all the year round. That which we regard as severe would
.be deemed mild in the East, where the seasons alternate
between torrid summers and boreal winters. We are hav
ing the best Christmas weather that the world affords. Let
us rejoice in it. ; : : y2'
The anti-dueling movement and agitation in Ger^
many has spread to Austria, and a large number of the
highest aristocracy of the empire have organized to put a
stop to the practice. Much of the success obtained by the
reformers thus far has been due to the personal influence
of Kaiser Wilhelm and full credit should be given to him.
Since it has been assured that the Chinese exclusion
bill will be re-enacted Minister \Vu has not been so bland
arid diplomatic as usual. He is now quoted as saying: "The
American people are biased beyond argument and reason
does not appeal to them." Mr. Wu is getting woozy.

But it is yet only as student effort that
their performance la interesting and
frcm that standpoint it is possible
to get a good deal of pleasure from listen
ing to them. I should like to suggest to
Miss Susan that the piano lid be lowered
in the trios, the piano frequently over
balancing the strings in the present ar
rangement. The little sisters played Mr
Pasmore's "Petite Suite," a couple of the
Brahms "Hungarian Dances." arranged
yerx well bytbale father, and Dorothy
and Mary gave 'cello and violin solos
respectively; two of Mendelssohn's "LJe
der ohne Worte." and an adagio and
canzone tta from Godard's rather mere
tricious "Concerto Romantlque."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Very different from the lot in life of
the Pasmore children is the fate of the
clever youngsters who have been singing
and dancing at the Tivoll for the last alx
week3, the Pollard Australian Juvenilo
Op*era Company. The conditions of the
lives of these children I believe to be as
nappy and natural as is possible under
lÂ£^i- cl rcumstances. They are treated
with all kindness and consideration by
their managers, and seem to live among
themselves in an atmosphere of accord
that would do credit to many families of
children that appear to be much more
fortunately situated. There are many
sweet and fine traits to be noted among
them, an admirable unselfishness, help
fulness and generous delight in the tri
umphs of their little confreres that would
shame many of their elders of the pro
fession. I have seen many pretty In
stances of this latter trait. I was beHInr* /

ITALY DESIRES
MORE TREATIES
Premier Tells of Efforts
to Benefit Agri
culture.
. ROME, Dec. 14.â Senor Zardenelli, the
Ita^an Premier, in the course of a long
Bta.tem.ent in the Chamber of Deputies,
5n which he showed how the efforts of
thÂ© Italian Government had improved the
health and material prosperity of Naples
and the southern Italian provinces, an
nounced that he hoped to conclude com
mercial treaties with Germany and Aus
tria benefiting Italian agriculture.
With that end in view, the Premier
said, he was studying a tariff which it
â was proposed would eventually provide as
a means of defense against foreign tar
iffs. The Government also hoped to con
clude satisfactory agreements with Rus
sia and Brazil.
Senor Zardenelli 6aid the country ought
to continue to make Naples a great man
ufacturing center by pouring capital into
it, end that the Government would ap
point a Government committee to con
sider the problem. He intended during
the next session of the Chamber of Dep
uties to introduce a bill to establish two
direct lines of railroads between Rome
and Naples and to reduce the Journey
between the Â»;wo cities to two and a half
hours.
Continuing, the Premier said he also
hoped it might be possible to construct a
central railroad between Bologna and
Rome, thus reducing the Journey between
Milan and Naples to nine hours. Then,
said Zardenelli. the St. Gothard and
Simplon tunnels will indeed become great
highways of mankind.
Another bill to be introduced proposes
the construction of aqueducts in Apulia,
a province of Southern Italy. These mea
sures would not disturb the national
finances, said the Premier, because the
r/ork would be takon in hand gradually.
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Desperate Case

Mrs. Win. Kenmore, So. Omaha, writes:
"I suffered many, many years with pro-
truding oilcs and dared not risk an ope-
ration. My case became desperate. I took

Concluding, he testified to the unani
mity of the Deputies ln making the sac
rifices to assure the prosperity and the
greatness of the country, and said It' was
such sacrifices that rendered the unity of
Italy possible and would render her great
among the nations. These remarks were
greeted with prolonged applause from ail
sides, the Deputies crowding around Zar
denelli to shake his hand and to congrat
ulate him.
WORLD-FAMED TAVERN.
Mount Tamalpais Resort Known to
Tourists of the World.
To the visitors from the East who an
nually spend a season amid the scenic
wonders of California there is a fascina
tion about Mount Tamalpais which no
other natural wonder affords. To view
the Burrouriding- country from this grand
eminence is a delight long to be remem
bered, as Is also the recollection of the
hospitality of the famous tavern which
crowns the summit of the mountain.
The tavern of Mount Tamalpais Is a
famous resort among tourists. No trip
to the mountain would be complete witH
out an inspection of its beauties and con
veniences. It is thoroughly heated and
lighted with gas and its appointments are
superb. From its spacious veranda the
most glorious views ever beheld may be
witnessed. Its cuisine is unsurpassed and
its service all that the most exacting
taste demands. The tavern is open every
day of the year.
MILWAUKEE RATT.BOAP
MAY BUILD A NEW LINE
Report That Northwestern Combina
tion Has Caused a Stir in An
other Direction.
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. 14.â The report
that the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul,
will probably build a line west from its
present terminus ln South Dakota be
cause of the fact that the Great North
ern-Northern Pacific-Burlington combina
tion is shutting them off from a just
share of the Northwestern business from
St." Paul to Chicago lse causing a great
deal of lntferest in this locality.
Although no unfavorable effect has so
far been seen, it has been feared all along
St. Paul to Chicago is causing a great
transcontinental roads supplying this
territory would eventually result in a con
dition of affairs similar to that in South
ern California, where the Southern Pa
cific has full sway and is practically able
to dictate its own terms to all the coun
try through which it passes. It is be
lieved, at any rate, that it would do the
Northwest no harm to have another big
railroad competing for the business east,
and the hope is therefore expressed that
the Milwaukee will be forced^ to push its
lines out through the Dakotas and Mon
tana. It seems highly probable, how
ever, that the Great Northern and North
ern Pacific and Burlington â will make all
sorts of concessions concerning the St.
Paul -Chicago business rather than have
the Milwaukee for a competitor out here.
It is now believed that the work of the
civil engineers in the eastern part of
Montana last summer was done in view
of the fact that an extension might have
to be made.
Entitled to Equal Shares.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa, Dec. 14.â
Judge Green's courtroom was filled to its
capacity when he convened court to-day.
There were present prominent attorneys
and jurists from Omaha and this city to
hear the opening argument by Charles J.
Hughes of Denver for the plaintiff in the
Doyle-Burns mining suit for a large block
of stock in the Portland Mining Com
pany. Referring to the early partnership
of James Doyle and James Burns, he said
there was no claim made by Doyle that
there was a business partnership, but
that the men had shared their ups and

both were entitled to equal shares ln their

PARIS, Dec. liâ The Socialists, through
their mouthpiece Deputy Viviani, brought
up the case of Socialist Herve, pro
fessor of history in the college of Sens,
in the Chamber of Deputies, he having
been removed from his post on account of
his virulent anti-military articles.
The interest In this case lays in an inci
dent which- occurred during the trial of
Herve on November 14 by the academic
council of Lijon, which recalled the Drey
fus case. Certain documents unfavorable
to Herve were communicated to the coun
cil without the knowledge of the defend
ant Â»
Viviani described this act as a flagrant
violation of the law and suppression of
the guarantees of the defendant. He said
that after the struggle France had gone
through , one might ask whether her ef
forts had been vain. Viviani demanded
the punishment of the rector of the acad
emy,_, who had communicated the docu
ments. â  . ' . ; .
Replying. Leygues, Minister of Public
Instruction, -Justified the proceedings
against Herve and said they had been
taken upon the instigation of General
Andre, the Minister of War.* He pointed
out that the documents in question were
not important and did not mention
Herve's name. 'Nevertheless, he said, the
superior council, on an appeal, had an
nulled its previous declaration and grant
ed a re-trial.
Leygues further said that the anti-mlll
tary doctrines which Herve held were in
â eompatlble with his position as a pro
fessor at the Lycee and that Herve was
not a fit person to instruct the youth in
the military glories of France. Leygues
concluded by asserting that Herve wished

Editor of / Saturday Eeview Is Vio

Canal Affairs.
LONDON, Dec. 14.â The Saturday Re
view, continues its campaign against the
Nicaraguan treaty. Tit' declares that
Senator Lodge's speech during the execu
tive .session of the Senate December 10
should at least make it clear how com
plete is Lord Lansdowne's surrender to
the United States. The Review holds
that permisslqn to fortify the canal ex
ists, but that Senator Lodge, in order to
win over the "more impudent believers
in American Almightlness," exaggerated
the intention of the treaty, the broad
principle ' of ' which, the writer holds, is
perfect neutralization and opposed to any
arbitrary act by the United States.
"But," the Saturday Review con
tinues, "nine points of the law are with
Senator Lodge. If the history of diplo
macy has shown anything it has proved
the absolute helplessness of broad princi
ples and wide implications in dealing with
unscrupulous politicians."

ranging money matters between ex-
Bailift James J.'Lynch'a family and the

how misrepresented.

have him Intercede with ' Frederick St.

conspiracy, in order to get money of
hers which St. John held. This money
was that alleged to have come from the

HOSEBERY MAY
FORM A PARTY
Former Premier Very
Much in th e British
I Limelight.
LONDON. Dec. 14.â The most talked of
man in England to-day is Lord Rosebery.
In anticipation of his speech on Monday,
Chesterfield is filling up with special cor
respondents, who send long dispatches de
scribing the ferment and local excitement.
So great has been the demand for admis
sion- to the hall, in which the lord will
speak that thousands of applications for
seats have been refused.
Such intense interest could scarcely b^
awakened by any other figure in Eng
land's recent political history. No one
seems to have tho faintest idea of what
Lord Rosebery is likely to say. His fore
cast of his intentions has gradually raised
public curiosity to a fever pitch, and if lie
only intends to gratify this by middle-of
the-road announcements he stands in
great danger of forever shattering what
reputation he has for serious purposes.
Yet, as the Standard points out, his
declaration of willingness to lead the Im
perialist Liberals would not. bring him
more supporters than could fill the offices.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bunnerman, Liberal
leader of the House of Commons, controls
the rank and file and the party organiza-'
tion. . ' . " ..
All kinds of rumors arc rife, the like
liest of which may be mentioned. It is
that Lord Rosebery intends at least lay
ing the foundations of a new party, which
will have himself, Sir Edward Grey, Her
bert H. Asquith and Sir Henry H. Fow
ler as its shining stars. If the Premier
merely continues his "lonely furrow" al
titude the Chesterfield meeting will be one
of the hugest jokes ever played on the
country. â¢ . .

MONEY MARKET
NEEDS RELIEF
Prepayment of Interest
Will Have a Good
Effect.
NEW TORK, Dec. 14.â It is expected
that there will be some relief ln the
money market during the current week
through the prepayment by the Treasury
of January interest due by the Govern
ment. Judging from experience, however,
not much impression probably will be
made by these payments, which will
amount to about $3,000,000 at New York,
because the need for money is so urgent.
Last week the flurry ln the money mar
ket was partly responsible for the large
sales of unmatured bonds and the pay
ment by the Sub-Treasury for these secu
rities amounting to $2,556,500. The checks
were collected over the counter of that
institution in order that the proceeds
might be made immediately available.
A movement which has begun to be im
portant is the withdrawal of new coins,
gold as well as silver from the Sub-Treas
ury for holiday presents. Such withdraw
als last week amounted to about $250.0uo
and it is likely that the volume will in
crease this week.
There was no evidence last week of
contributions to the needs of the New
York money market by the Canadian
bank. This Is somewhat surprising, be
cause usually when money is dear here
these banks seek to take advantage of
the fact, and bring gold over the border
for the purpose of loaning it ln New
York. The fact that on "Wednesday and
Friday of last week money was freely
offered in the last hour by large banking
interests with the result of breaking the
rate temporarily seems to show that these
Interests are intent upon preventing if
possible any undue derangement of the
market, and as their resources are sup
posed to be enormous they will most like
ly succeed in their efforts to restore nor
mal conditions to the monetary situation.

GAS AND TROUBLE
Comes From White Bread.
While It Is true that webulld up the
body from food. It Is also true that dif-
ferent kinds of food have different effects
on the body and produce dfferent re-
sults.
For Instance, It la absolutely Impossible
to live on white bread alone, for It con-
tains almost nothing but starch, and an
excess of white bread produces gas and
trouble ln the Intestines, while, at the
same time, the other elements required
by the. body for building up brain and
nerve centers, as well as muscular tissue;
have been left out of the white bread,
and we eee from experience the one try-
ing to live on white bread alone gradually
fails in mental and nervous power as well
as loss ln muscle.
Such a diet could not be kept up long
without fatal results. A lady in Jackson,
ville. Fla., was crippled by an accident
two years a^o. Betas without the power
of exercise, an old stomach trouble that
was hers for years became worse, and ft
was a serious question regarding food that
she could digest
A physician put her on Grape-Nuts
Breakfast Food with some remarkable
results. She says now that, not only Is
Elie able to do a big day's work, because
of the strength of her brain and nerves,
Lut that she has finally thrown away her
crutches because the muscles of her
limbs have gradually grown stronger
since she began, the use of Grape-Nuts,
and now she is practically well and can
iro about without trouble, notwithstand-
ing the fact that it was said she would
never be able to walk again. So much
f or : eating the right kind of food instead
of remaining an invalid and a cripple be-
cause of the lack of knowledge of the
lund of food to use to bring one back to
health. Name given on application to

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â It is said to
be definitely , decided that President

Andrew Carnegie of . $10,000,000 bonds . of
the United States Steel Corporation for
the purpose of founding an institution for
higher education in .this city, s â¢ ..
The views of prominent Senators and
Representatives, as they have been given
to the President. - are practically unani
mous against the acceptance of the offer
in its present shape. * The provision at
tached to the offer. that the Government
shall hold the bonds, for a term of. years
ls â¢ c . onsldered especially objectionable.
The President, however, is very hopeful
that an adjustment â < can be made by
wh ch Carnegie will convert the bonds
which he tendered into cash or United
States bonds, and that the gift can then
be accepted in that. shape.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â Andrew Carne
gie, on being asked about the $10,000,000
gift which he has offered to the Govern
ment for a national university, said:
"That Washington matter will come out
all right. If I had to sell these bonds
myself I would have.no trouble in getting
the money for them. There will be no
trouble about the Washington matter,

LAI* RAFAEL IS BUOYED.
Diver Goes Down and Positively Lo
cates Wreck.
There is now no doubt that the wreck
of the ferry steamer San Rafael has been
located. Yesterday Diver Ben Newman
went down, and on coming to the sur
face again said the grappling iron was
fast to the pilot-house and that the ves
sel was on her side. Red paint from the
paddle wheels were on his diving boots
and blue and white paint was on his suit.
When three of Crowley's -launches went
out early yesterday morning there .was
aboard besides President J. B. Stetson of
the North Pacific Coast road several of
the directors of the road and the wreck
ing crew. At slack water the diver went
down and on his Teturn to the surface
made the foregoing report. Mr. Stetson
was not satisfied, however, and the diver
was given a knife and sent down to cut a
sliver from the hulL By. this time the
tide was running strong and Newman
could not even reach the hull. After be
ing down a few minutes he reported that
the grappling iron had pulled away and
that he could not reach the wreck again.
A 500-pound anchor has been put down to
locate the spot, however, and to-morrow
the diver will go down again and bring
up the silver that will convince President
Stetson that the wreck has been located.
It is the intention of the company to
raise her_if possible, but as she is down
more than 100 feet there will be some
trouble in the operation.
Will Carry a Curious Cargo.
Among the vessels that must have been
caught ln the northwester Is the schooner
Winchester. She is now out nine dayB from
San Francisco for Portland and should
have been heard from. On her arrival on
the Columbia River she will take aboard
a hospital for Samoa. This hospital, to
gether with its equipment, is being con
structed on an order from Gustav Kunst
of the big exporting firm of Kunst &
Albers. Mr. Kunst recently purchased
the home of the late Robert Louis Stev
enson ln Samoa and resides in that beau
tiful land for a portion of the year. Since
his residence there Mr. Kunst has become
very kindly disposed toward the gentle
South Sea Islanders around whom Stev

and romance, and it Is to show his good

WHAT GOES UP
Must Come Down.
Nothing is~ more certain' than that the
use of so-called r tonics, stimulants and
medicines,. which depend upon alcohol for
their effect, . r is Injurious to health in the
leng: run. . "H. .â¢:-
â  What goes up mast tjome down and the
elevation of spirits', thÂ«' temporary exhil-
aration "resulting from k dose of medicine
containing. alcphoK will certainly be fol-
lowed -in a few hours by a corresponding
depression to relieve,' which. another dose
must be taken. .';â .'â¢'â ." : - ;
â¢ In other wJpnJs, many liquid patent med-
icines deriye'thelr -effect entirely from
the alcohol they\ contain: ' ;â 
. Alcohol and* medicines containing It are
temporary stimulants .and not In any
sen^e a true tonic* In fact it is doubtful
if any medicine. or, drug is a real tonic' -'
A true tonic fs sbmething which will re-
new," replenish, .build -up the exhausted
nervous system: ajid wasted tissues of the
body; something. that will enrich the blood
and endow it with the proper proportions
of red and white corpuscles, which pre-
vent' or destroy' disease germs. This ; is
what a real tonic should do and no drug
or alcoholic Btimulant will do it.
The only true tonic ln nature is whole-
some food, thoroughly digested. Every
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of blood is created
dally from the food we digest. ' â¢
The. mere eating of food has little to do
with the repair of waste tissue, but the
perfect digestion of the food eaten has
everything to do with it.
The reason so few people have perfect
digestion is because from wrong.habits of
living the stomach has gradually lost'the
power to secrete the gastric juice, pep-
tones and acids ln sufficient quantity, j
To -. cure . indigestion ' and . Stomach
troubles It is necessary to take 'after
meals some " harmless preparation which
will supply the natural peptone and dias-
tase which every, weak stomach ; lacks,
and probably the best, preparation of this
character is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
which may be found' in every drug store
and : which contain; in pleasant S palatable
form the wholesome .'peptone and diastase
which nature requires for prompt- diges-
tion. , -.â â¢â . . .v ;
One or two of these excellent: tablets
taken after meals will" prevent souring,
fermentation and acidity. and Insure com-
plete digestion and assimilation. "â  , â¢
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tabletsare equally
valuable for little, children' as for adults,
as they contain nothing harmful or stim-
ulating, but only the; natural digestives.
One of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets .will
digest 1800 grains of meat, eggs or > other
wholesome food, and they, are in every
sense a ; genuine tonic because they, .bring:
about in the only/natural way' a restora-
tive of nerve power, a building up of lost
tissue- and' appetite, in the; only way. it
can -be done by the digestion and assimi-
lation Of wholesome food..

NEW EXCLUSION
ACT PROPOSED
United States Attorney
Woodworth Makes
Amendments.
TTnited States restrict Attorney Mar
â¢hall B. Woodworth has forwarded to
each member of the California delegation
to Congress a copy of his suggestions re
epectlng the re-enactment -of - a. Chinese
restriction act. These suggestions are
embodied In a bill prepared by him. ;
Section 1 provides that all present laws
on the subject be continued In force for
ten years after May 5, 1902, with certain
necessary amendments.
Bection 2 provides for the registration
of all Chinese laborers lawfully in the
United States at the time of the passage
of the proposed act. As amended,, the
section empowers United States Commis
sioners as well as united States Judges
to try and deport Chinese found unlaw
fully in the country. Any registered
Chinaman hereafter convicted of felony
shall be deported from the United States.
Section 4 provides that any person aid
ing or abetting the landing or attempted
landing unlawfully of any Chinese person
shall be punished by five years' imprison
ment or a fine of $1000. or both.
Section 5 Includes fishermen, laundry
men, miners, hucksters, peddlers, fish
dryers, gamblers and lewd women as la
borers.
An appeal, by the United States Attor
ney from the Judgment of acquittal by a
Judge or Commissioner is also allowed
Slave owning, whether the slave be of
'native or foreign birth, is also defined as
a crime.
The object of this amendment is that it
shall apply to those holding to involun
tary service native-born citizens of the
united States. There is no general law
against slavery In the revised statutes
other than that applying to negroes and
mulattoes.
The present law Elmply applies to per
sons of foreign birth. By amending -ths
act as herein suggested, much of the evil
that now exists in the Chinese quarters
in holding to involuntary servitude Chi
nese girls born within the United States
would be done away with by prosecu
tions, which, under the law as It stands
at present, cajinot be done.
Abused Their Horses.
John Powell, a horse dealer on Folsom
â¢street, near Twelfth, was arrested yester
day by Officer Curry of the Humane So
ciety for maltreating a horse which had
been foundered. The animal was shot by
Officer Curry at the Petaluma wharf, on
Eaet street. M. Phillipino. a florist at
Post and Kearny streets, was also arrest
â¢d by the same officer for driving a horse
â¢wnicn was Buffering from wounds on the
back.
__DVEB_TSE____NTS.
FEW PEOPLE REALIZE
Th.e Danger in That Common Disease,
Catarrh.
Because catarrhal diseases are so com-
men and because catarrh Is not rapidly
fatal, people too often overlook "and ne-
STlect it until some Incurable ailment de-
velops as a result of tho neglect.
Tbe Inflame, condition of the membrane
cf the nose and throat makes a fertile soil
for the germs of Pneumonia and Con-
mimption. in fact catarrhal pneumonia
*n_ catarrhal consumption are the most
common forms of these dreaded diseases,
*"hlch annually cause more than one-
auarter of the deaths In this country.
Remedies for catarrh are almost as
numerous as catarrh sufferers, but very
fe-r have any actual merit as a cure, the
only good derived being simply a tempo-
rary relief.
There is. however, a very effective rem-
edy recently discovered which Is rapidly
becoming famous for Its great value In re-
lieving and permanently curing all forms
of catarrhal diseases, whether located In
the head, throat, lungs or stomach.
This new catarrh cure is principally
composed of a gum derived from the Eu-
calyptus tree, 9nd this gum possesses ex-
traordinary healing and antiseptic proper-
ties. It is taken Internally In the *nn_
of a lozecge or tablet, pleasant to the
taste and so harmless that little children
Lake them with safety and benefit.
Eucalyptus oil and the bark are some-
times used, but are not so convenient nor
so palatable as the gum.
Undoubtedly the best quality Is found in
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, which may be
found in any drug store, and any catarrh
sufferer who has tried douches. Inhalers
and liquid medicines will be surprised _t
the rapid improvement after a few day*'
use of Stuart's Catarrh. Tablets, which
are composed of the gum of the Eucalyp-
tus tree, combined with other antiseptics
which destroy the germs of catarrh In the
blood and expel the catarrhal soison from
the system.
Dr. Ramsdell in speaking of catarrh tnd
Us cure says: "After many experiments
[ have given up the Idea of curing catarrh
by the use of inhalers, washes, salves or
liquid medicines. I have always had the
best results from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; the red gum and other valuable anti-
septics contained in these tablets make
them, in my opinion, far superior to any
of the numerous catarrh remedies so ex-
tensively advertised." The fact that'StU-
art's Catarrh Tablets are sold in drug
stores under protection of a trademark
thould not prejudice conscientious physi-
cians against them, because their un-
doubted merit and harmless character
make them a remedy which every catairh
eufferer may use with perrect safety and
the prospect of a permanent cure.
For colds In the head, for . coughs, ca-
,-vrhal deafness and catarrh of the stom-
ach and liver, people who bave tried them
eay that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are a
household necessity.
PLEASURE PLACE
FOR THE BEACH
Oohejr Island Will Be
Duplicated Near the
Cliff House.
Incorporation Is Completed
and Work on Grounds
Will Boon Begin. .
Coney Island, ,of .world-wide fame,
stands in the: unique position of being,
without a rival on the earth. It is the
pride and the boast of those residents be
low East | Fourteenth street, New York
City, to within ear-shot of Manhattan's
City Hall.- that there is but one glorious,
Jaggy, raggy, go-as-you-please Coney. A
solar plexus blow must, therefore, be en
dured by .the habitue of the Bowery's rec
reation haunt when it is made known this
morning to the world that on the thresh
old of the Pacific another Coney Island is
planned, with a carnival of merry-go
round, whirligig, - see-saw, donkey . rides
and observation: wheels, with the attend
ant froth-capped goblets of "steam" and
"lager," and tamales and enchilados.
Within a few days workmen' will begin
erecting fences- and buildings and laying
out the gTounds upon the sand dunes
fronting the highway between Golden
Gate Park and the front of the Cliff
House hill. The enterprise Is to be known
as "The Ocean Side Gardens," and tbe
declaration is made by the projectors 'that
"it Is proposed to make the beach a veri
table Coney Island."
Those interested in the project are E. J.
Leigh of the firm of Davidson & Leigh,
real estate; R. M. Hotaling, liquor mer
chant; T. P. Colcord, retired sea captain;
F. C. Howard: S. C. Murray, contractor;
Curtis Tobey Jr., architect, and A. Ruef,
attorney. A ten years' lease has been
signed, with the option of purchase, and
papers of incorporation have been filed
at. Sacramento. The capital stock has'a
value of $100,000, the greater part of which
has already been subscribed by the pres
ent members of the company. It Is offi
cially announced that the intention is to
make the "Ocean Side Gardens" one of
the city's most popular attractions and a
feature of the beach, but the breezesâ the
one -advantage for which Coney Island
sighs In vainâ are to form no part of the
Garden's entertainment, and will be ex
cluded by a . formidable combination of
tight boards and pickets, "stained a dark
green to blend harmoniously with the
foliage." :
Buildings are promised of the pavilion
order with glass frontages overlooking
the roads and the ocean, while promenade
decks provided with seats and tables wilf
offer rest for the weary. The main en
trance will be from B street near the
terminus of the electric car line. As a
family enticement there 'will be a chil
dren's playground and on Saturdays and
Sundays and _11 off-days, musical and
athletic programmes will be given. Base
hall and kindred, games are promised,
while a theater - for the exploitation of
vaudeville is sprlously contemplated.
There may well arise apprehension
among the peanut vendors, the inhab
itants of the waffle wagons and the itiner
ant merchants who are accustomed to ply
their respective callings in the vicinity of
the Cliff House, since it is authoritatively
stated that the management intends to
absorb the industrial stands which now
thrive around the depot and on the beach.
l-HS. DONOVAN DENIES
â¢ STEPCHILDREN'S CHARGES
Says She Did Not Ilarry Their
Father to Secure His
' 'â  \ Wealth.
Lizzie 11. Donovan, widow of the late
M. J. Donovan, who is defendant In a
suit brought by Gertrude and Vincent
Donovan, -Donovan's children by a form
er marriage, to set aside an assignment
of property right made by Donovan to his
second wife, on the ground that he was
unduly influenced, tiled an answer to the
charges yesterday.
Donovan's children claimed that they
were not informed that their father in
tended taking a second wife until after
he had married and that therefore they
cpuld not take any steps to prevent Mtb.
Donovan from so influencing Donovan
that he grew to hate his children. They
claim that Mrs. Doncfvan married him for
the express purpose of securing Dono
van's property and that when she had
turned 'their father's love "to hatred she
induced him to assign to her a lease he
held. on real estate and improvements on
Eddy and "Webster streets and also 108
shares of stock of the Ingleside Coursing
Association.
Mrs. Donovan denies all the charges
made by her stepchildren and asserts that
whatever gifts her husband made to her
were made while he was in full posses
sion of his faculties and that she never
tried to gain control or dominion over her
husband for the purpose of getting his
property. â¢ ,
GBIN PBE_"EBS AMERICA '
TO I1AND OE CZAR
Attachment Is Not Needed to Keep
Bussian . Accused of Embezzle
ment From Leaving State.
"Lincoln Ivenow Grin does not need to
be served with a writ of attachment to
keep him from returning to Russia," sa'd
Attorney George D. Collins to Judge Sloss
yesterday. "He is satisfied to remain
here."- â  â¢'.-
; On. this representation Judge Sloss dis
missed the writ of attachment heretofore
sued by a local representative of a Rus
sian firm which accuses Grin of embez
zling 512,500 while he was a clerk in their
employ in tho land of the Czar. Grin
came. to this city and deposited a sum of
money In one of the local banks. The
localfcTepresentative of Grin's former em
ployers, secured an order of court-re
stralnirig -the . alleged embezzler from
drawing the funds from tne bank on the
ground that the money was part of the
sum he Is accused of running away with.
It was also feared that Grin would at
tempt to leave the State and an attach
ment was ls*uedto restrain him from
leaving:, the State.'
It is expected that extradition papers
will be secured and that Grin will be bent
back to Russia for trial on the felony
charge.

POLICE ADVANCE
ACCIDENT THEORY
Do Not Believe That
Oppenheim Was
4 Murdered.
No Clew Yet Found to Iden
tity of Man Who Fired
r-\: the Fatal Shot.
The slayer of Adolph Oppenheim has not
yet been" apprehended. . The: police Vare
leaving nothing undone in their search for
the man , who ', killed the shooting gallery
proprietor,; but there 1 is little hope that the
mystery will. ever' be solved, , as so many
strangers come and go through Dupont
street and in and out of shooting gal
leries; . saloons and > dance, halls that the
n_an who. entered Oppenheim's place and
fired the 'fatal shot from one of Oppen
heim's'own rifles probably attracted no
attention whatever by his suspicious
haste in departing. . : ; - -
The detectives have followed out several
clews in thfir efforts, to, locate the man
who fired the shot, workingon the theory
that the shooting was accidental. In one
case they believed they had information
that would lead to an arrest.^Wit further
investigation showed that the suspected
man had a conclusive alibi. â¢â¢
"If Oppenheim had been shot .with any
thing except a 22-caliber bullet? from one
of his own rifles," said Captain Seymour
yesterday, "there would be reason to
think the deed was done with murderous
intent. But no man would have gone Into
that gallery and deliberately attempted
murder with a weapon of that sort. There
was no quarrel, for the son in the room
above could easily hear conversation car
ried en below. â¢ r . . â¢
"The- downward course of the bullet In
dicates nothing in this case, for bullet' of
small ca!'ber are particularly apt to lake
the most erratic courses, especially wuX-ii
a bone Is struck. Besides, a foot more of
height for the man who fired the. shot
would not make a perceptible difference
in the angle at which the bullet entered
the body." . â  /

LEADING FIRMS
POOL INTERESTS
Miller, Sloss & Scott and
Gibbs Company Con
solidate.
Will Be Known^as the Pacific
'â â â : Hardware and Steel
Company.
The consolidation of the hardware firm
of MilleV, Sloss & Scott and the" old iron
afid steel firm of the GeOrge ' "W." Gibbs'
Company was formally announced to the
trade yesterday. The consolidated inter
ests .will be km>wn after January 1 as the
Pacific Hardware and Steel Company.
The. negotiations to this end were pend
ing for several months. In July the re
port was current that all the leading Iron,
steel and hardware firms of the city were
about to combine and form a gigantic
trust - This was denied by the various
interests affected. V Whether' the consoli
dation referred to has any connection with
the rumor circulated last summer, the re
sult ;may possibly indicate. It is certain,
however,' that the? two* firms doing busU
ness under the name of the Pacific Hard
ware and Steel Company will practically
control the market on the coast for the
lines of goods they represent.
The George W. Gibbs Company was es
tablished many years ago J by i the late
George W. Gibbs. It did an enormous
iron and steel business and. its facilities
for handlinff that line of goods were of
the best. The firm of Miller,'. Slosa &
Scott is an old one, and for many years
has been the leader in its line. - The firm
is located in itsnew ouildlng at the cor
ner of Mission and Fremont streets. Tho
quarters are commodious and enable the
firm to 'handle immense quantities of gen
eral hardware, : tinware and sporting
goods. The headquarters of tho consoli
dated firms will be In the building now
occupied by Miller, Sloss & Scott.
Â» a'few days the directors of the
new, company will meet and choose offi
cers, of the new* corporation. It Is said
that < Charles E. Miller will be selected as
president. A manager and secretary will
be chosen, but the names of those to be
selected have not "been made public.

abcock Is a noseless failure as^a
Liabcock is now on a elck leave and
is duties have been assumed by a lady

Â«â¢ Â£ Education, stated yesterday
sat Miss Johnston had filed a written
?Quest that, the lady be continued in the

jsults had vastly improved during Bab

Mrs. Kincald would not say what dispo
iuon would be made of Bibcock's case,
s no charges had been filed with the
oaxd against ' him. Mrs. Klncaid said
116 *, 1^^ not he ard whether any
harges had been filed with the Superin

; was the duty of that official to transmit
hem Immediately to the board-
Superintendent Webster did not care to
pea_ ca the matter, as it is his policy
5 keep all charges filed against a teacher
secret until the accused is brought to
riaL Webster admitted that Principal
ohrston had complained of Babcock' s
ick of efficiency, but said hÂ« did not
iio-â ir she would reduce her charges to
fitting:. W ebster says principals are
>rone to make verbal charges, but that
rhen they are asked to swear to them
â¢ver their signature they positively re
use to do so.
Director Desmaa said â¢ that Eabcock
-â as not a good disciplinarian when he
iss a teacher in the Franklin Evening
Babcock himself had asked the
loard to relieve him from his duties at
he Fair-mount School if a position of
â¢cral Importance could be found for him.
There is a rumor that the board is bent
m dismissing Knowlton from the vice
)rincipalship of the John Swett School
ind installing Babcock in the vacancy.
cCnowlton is now on trial on charges
>ref erred by Principal Lyser and will
Tiake his defense next Tuesday. Should
Miss Johnston file written charges
yrair.st Babcock, however, he may also
experience seme difficulty in saving Mm
5C-lf from the wrath of the school board.
No Overtime for Extra Work.
Auditor Wells cited the deputies in the
Registrar's office who have filed demands
Cor overtime pay to' appear before him
\.PFterday and explain in detail the nature
if the extra work which they performed
previous and subsequent to election time.
He put the deputies under oath and as
:nTTÂ£.:rn=d for his own satisfaction wheth
?r the work was in addition to their regu
.ar duties. Wells thinks that if he should
"Uidit the demands it would lead to other
ibuses in that line, and he will decline to
set a precedent. The deputies will bring
suit to settle the dispute.

SUPREME COURT SETS
GRAVE-ROBBERS FREE
Merced County Ghouls Who "Uncov
ered Remains of a Chinaman Es-
cape on Technicality.
William Baumgartner and . Emmet
Rhew, who in February last opened the
grave of Wong Quoi Sing at Merced for
the purpose of robbery and who viere^con
victed on a' felony therefor by the' Su :
perlor Court of the county, were ordered
set free by the Supreme Court yesterday.
The two men heard that.a large sum of
money was concealed on the body of
the dead Chinaman and they decided to
secure it The coffin was uncovered and
the grave-robbers had found a ten-cent
pieco and a counterfeit dollar when they
were frightened away. v Their arrest im
mediately followed and charges of violat
ing sepulture were placed against them." *
The statute under which they were con
victed provides that any one who muti
lates or disinters the body of a human
being le guilty of a felony. The 1 trial
court held that the defendants had to all
intents and purposes disinterred the re
mains, of Wong Quol Sing. â¢
- The Supreme Court maintains, however,
that a body must be removed to consti
tute a disinterment and the two prisoners
were allowed to go free with an expres
sion of regret, that reprehensible act
is not a crime unrter the law.

Victor Metcalf Taking Rank
as a Leading Man in
The Union League Club' of this city Is
making . preparations for Its annual elec
tion of officers. Some of the best known
Republicans of the State are on, the nom
inating committee, among them being Ja
cob H. Neft, C. H. Garoutte, Joseph R.
Knowland and Harold T. Power. The
presidency of the league for a term em
bracing a national or State election is- an
honor, highly f prized by the active raem-
Alden' Anderson, president of the State
League of Republican Clubs, has issued
a notice Inviting tho members of the
league executive committee to meet' at
the rooms of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, Palace Hotel, at 2 p. m.
to-morrow. The principal business of- the
committee will be to nx the time of the
biennial convention to be held at San Jose
in the spring. The convention at L*na
Angeles In' the spring ot 1MJ0 was a nota
ble demonstration or Republican strength
and contidence and Inspired the party
leaders to great activity In tho Presi
dential campaign which Immediately fol
lowed. It is believed that thq San Jose
meeting will call together 2300 progressive
Republicans.
Representative . Victor II. Metcalf of
California, who was recently assigned to
a place on the Ways and Means Commit
tee.. Is generally regarded throughout the
country as one of the leading men In Con
gress. He belongs to the strenuous, up-to
date class of American statesmen. It Is
said. that he will not listen to suggestions
that ho should enter the race for Gov
ernor of California. His closest political
advisers hint that his only ambition is to
go higher In Congress.
The Philadelphia North American, In
commenting on the agltntlon In Congress
to abolish football games between the
army and navy cadets, refers incident
ally in this fashion to Mr. Metcalf's col
lege career: â  .
If Representative Wachtcr of Baltimore hat
Ills way Congress will put an end to the annual
football games on Franklin field between West
Point and Annapolis. The game Is not only
brutal, ho says, but Is not Included. In thÂ«
cadets', curriculum. What grieves him most,
however. Is that President Roosevelt should
have manifested his approval of the sport by
attending, the last game In this city. â¢ Fortu
nately the West Point-Annapolis .game- finds an
enthusiastic champion . In ..Representative Met
calf. Mr. Metcalf rowed In the Yale crew along
In the seventies. The \ old collegian love of
strenuous sport Is as strong In him as in
President Roosevelt, who was at Harvard
when Mr. Metcalf was at Yale. If Mr. Wach
ter gets past Mr. Metcalf with his bill pro
hibiting .the cadets . from playing football
President Roosevelt will be back of the line
to stop him. s â¢ 'r'-i Â»V

;i :-.'.â¢ of the Coast.- â¢
Tbe merchants of this city and of Seat
tle bave decided to make a vigorous ef
fort to secure for the people of the United
States, and particularly for the people of
the Pacific Coast, a Just portion of the
trad-e with the Philippine Islands. To at
tain this end a petition has been prepared
and; will be sent to every Representative
W the Pacific Coast States in Congress.
flic: petition points cut that the Philip
pines fire how United States territory and
that all trade with the islands should be
conducted in American vessels. The Rep
resentatives are requested to use their m-
Iluence to have the coastwise navigation
lawg extended to the vessels engaged In
commerce with the Philippines. ,
The bill to temporarily provide revenue
for the Philippine Islands, which Is being
considered by the House, provides that
vessels not of the United States may ply
between these islands, notwithstanding
the -coastwise navigation laws, until the
1st <lay of January, 1935, when it is be
lieved these islands may safely come un
der the operation of the present statutes
and 'vessels of the United States only be
emnloved in commerce with them. The
merchants of the Pacific Coast desire to
have the date named in the provision
changed to January I, 1903. -.
The petition which will be sent to the
Senators and Congressmen is as follows:
la order to secure to the people of the United
State, the benefits to which they are Â«Jtltled
as a result of the acquisition ot thÂ« Philippine
Islands the commercial intereÂ»ts of the nation
j^id especially of the Pacific <*>â â * *****

be without question a Â«ufnclent number rorta

BROWN'S WILL
IS CONTESTED
Relatives Quarrel . Over
;the Large Amount of
Ready Gash.
The ownership of between $70,000 and
$80,000 is involved in a contest of the will
of James 'F. Brown, deceasea, formerly
of this city, who died in December. 1900.
Papers .'have been prepared and will be"
filed to-morrow in the Superior- Court by
attorneys for the contesting "relatives,
Messrs. , Henry M. Owen, T. C. West and
Frank J. Hennessey. 'There are about a
dozen contestants, all of v/hom live .in
Kentucky. They are Martha Brown, Mrs.
Laura Cunningham, Mary Brown Marr,
Isabelle Brown Case, Bettie Brown Gib
son. Lucy J. McClure, Isaac N. Brown,
Thomas G. "Brown and W.-/H. White,
nephews and nieces of the deceased.
The ground, of contest is a claim that
undue influence was used by the legatees
under the willâ Vina Brown, Ella Brown,
Polly Brown and- John : Brown of Ken
tucky. The decedent, a bachelor : of 78
years, was of. somewhat penurious habits.
V.*hen he went back to Kentucky to. visit
his relatives, so the complaint sets forth,
he heard stories tnat certain of his rela
tives did not wish to receive him becaus-3
of his dress and personkl appearance. He
became angry, turned his back" on '.the
supposed offenders and promptly gave the
bulk of- his property to the four legatees.
â¢Brown's wealth was principally in cash;
stocks and bonds, deposited in the sev
eral banks of San Francisco.^ He â¢ also
held- some real- estate in this city.' The
will being filed here will necessitate 1 the
coming her, of a .considerable number , of

The local - United States Inspectors of

tain. O. F. Bolles, have sent, their "decision
on the Sah j Rafael _ wreck to Supervising
Inspector Captain John Bermingham. Ac
cording to their findings the license of
Captain McKenzle, .which expires on Jan-:
uary 2, 1902, Is revoked. A punishment
equal in duration of time is. meted out: to
Captain Tribble of the Sausalito. -The

unaer tne concmons existing on the night
ot the collision. â â â â¢-..â 'â¢* ' , â  â¢ â¢
It was a lucky thing for both ferry-boat
masters that Captain 'McKenzie's license
expires within such a short time. ; .Tne
Inspectors can punish only to the expira
tion of the license., fribble's license has
a year or more. to run, .so he also benefits
by the time 'limitation of McKenzie's
license. Tnbble's license is suspended
for thirty days, beginning December 14.
Under the ordinary course Captain : Mc-
Kenzie's license would be renewed -with
out, an examination. In case he wishes
to continue his pilot occupation he must
pass : another examination. -*â¢ His pnly ap
peal lies with Captain Bermingham.

fair: In tiie matter of collision between the
ferry steamers ban Rafael and Sausalito In a
dense tosi on the bay of San Francisco about
U:40 p. m., November 30, l'JOl, upon Investiga
tion thereof, from tetimony taken, we find as
follows:
Official Details of Accident.
The San liafael, J. T. McKenzle, master and
pilot in charge, leit her Blip in ban t rancisco
at 0:25 p. m. of that date. The log was very
thick, weather calm, with strong ebb tide.
Une. vessel ~ was running slow, . sounding - her
tog whistles, and passed Lombard-street wharf
at \i:M~ i>. m. Her course was then 'set NW. by
\V.-for ine bell at east end of Aicatraz â  Island,'.
Capuun JUcivenzie heading, his '.steamer more
to me westward than usual on account 'of a
vessel that he thought mignt be anchored near
Blossom Kock , buoy. .A- lew miautes matter
ward he heard! a steamer's whistle, apparently
off hia starboard bow. - As "the -.whistle got
nearer Camam . Mctyenzie blew two" whistus,
which were- answered -by* the other vessel, ana
put his -helm to starboard; . he then stopped
and; backed : the.ensines | fuil | speed I and ,blew
three .whistles, â  which . were answered by the
other beat.' ;â¢' After. maUinu about "tour' revolu
tions â  bac-King, â¢ he stopped her. engines,, but she
liau swuntt uoout a point to. port and at this
time the two vessels 'came together,- the. Sau
balito's bow striking the h'an Katael on the
starboard side. ; The guard of the: Sausalito
coming over. the deck. if the San Katael, broKe
in its sidehouse where the restaurant was. and
the rudder of the Sausalitp cut \ throuKii the
hull' of the San Kafael, causing her to nil and
sink about fliteen minutes atterward.
: The ferry steamer Sausc.lito, W. T. Tribble,
master and pilot In charge, 'left Kausalito ' slip
about l>:12 p. m., "November ai),* for San Fran
cisco. The weather was a thick tog. calm, and
strong'- ebb , tide running. ' The â  Saisalitp was
run 'at ordinary speeduntil otf the bell at -the
east end of Aicatraz Island, which was passed
at a distance of 800 to 1000 feet at ti:ao p. m.
At this time the steamer was, put under a slow
bell and the course set SK. >i K., which Cap
tain Tribble thought would bring the Sausalito
to San Francisco to the NW. of Lombard pier.
After passing Aicatraz bell, a fog whistle was
heard several times, apparently off- the port
bow; then two whistles. Captain Tribble an
swered these two whistles, ordered the helm
hard-a-starboard, j stopped . and backed the en
gines full speed, . and blew three whistles In
answer I to the San , . Rafael. The Sausalito
swung 1% points to the port, and 'before she
lost her headway she struck the San Rafael.'
The two vessels separated a little, the Sau
saiiio then came ahead 1 slow, and through tht
prompt action of both captains and crew, the
vessels were made ,- fast together by strong
lines. -The passengers were then got on board
the - Sausalito as rapidly as possible, some go
ing through the window and some over the up
per deck of the San Rafael Boats of both
vessels were immediately ' lowered and some
of th(- passengers got in them and were taken
to the Sausalito. Others jumped overboard
with life-preservers on and were picked up by
the boat, and \>t ners were pulled up with lines
by the passengers and crew of the. Sausalito. â¢
McKenzie Last to Leave San Kafael.
-As before stated the San Rafael sank about
fifteen minutes' alter the' collision,-' the lines
that' held the two vessels together parting as
she went down. Captain McKenzie, after look
ing throuEh-the cabin of the San Kaiael, was
the last man to 'leave, her and says there was
no one on board as ' he, looked all around ' the
main deck'and .had "just time to get off as
she went down. During the time the vessels
were lashed together they were drifting with
the .tide and the whistle of the . Sausalito was
kept blowing. 'The lifeboats from both of the
steamers succeeded Mn rescuing some of 'the
passengers and continued in . that service â¢â  for
about â¢ an ';'<â  hour. ; These vessels ; were fully
equipped with all life saving appliances re
quired by law; it is In evidence that there
were plenty of life: preservers, the water be
tween the two steamers being covered with
them. '.'...-. : ' * - . . , ':
â  The boats of the Sausalito were lowered
promptly â  and ' two ', boats of the San" Rafael ;
one of these was said not to have dIuks in,
but it is in evidence that -' two plugs â¢ with
lanyards were found in this boat. One of the
crew of- the- San Rafael, a waiter, was fatally
crushed by . the breaking in of the house , on
the San Rafael at. the time of the collision and
a boy and one man were drowned in this cas
ualty. 1 - It was the opinion given in evidence
that had the San. Rafael been bulkheaded she
would not have sunk.' âºâ  â  â  :..;â :
â¢ After a careful 'consideration -of the' testl-'
mony.in this case we are of . the opinion that
both Captain' McKenzie and Captain Tribble
were 'â negligent .in- navigating these steamers
on â  the â¢ above occasion on November 30 . last,
in violation. of rule IX of the rules and regu- 1
lations. and article. lU.'of , r the pilot rules for

horsemen to the north and then tne
scent-led in- a westerly direction toward
the San- Bruno foothills, with their ves
ture of green. The course soon changed .
again and the members of the field found
themselves. -riding toward Burlingame.
The -line was a zigzag one, up hill and
down dale, presenting an <everchanging
panorama to the riders. There were the
customary checks, the hunt ending near .
above rules laid down â  by the i Super
vising Inspectors ~ of 'â  Steam Vessels
for the governance of pilots of steam

equally responsible for the collision,
and Captain' McKenzie's ; license ' ex

of the foremosti banks in. the State., Two
years after the incorporation . the capital
stock was reduced to $2,000,000, but later
this. was increased to y5,000,000. Unfavor
able legislation prompted the management
of the bank to reduce- the capital In 1873
to $3,000,000. InlSft* the capital was again
reduced to $2,000,000. and $1,000,000 returned

NATIVE DAUGHTERS' BALL
Enjoyable Social Event Is Given Un

A social event cf the last week in
South San Francisco was the ball that
was given last night in the South San
Francisco Opera-house at Railroad and'
Fourteenth avenues by La Vespero Par
lor, Native Daughters of the Golden

many of the residents of that part of the
city and many friends of the members
who live distant from that section to en
joy the well arranged programme of
dances in the prettily decorated hall.
The entire membership of the parlor,
except those on the committee of ar
rangements, acted in the capacity of a
reception committee, while those who had
arranged the exceedingly pleasant social
function were Mrs. Frances W. Griffiths,
chairman of the committee; Mrs. Nellie
R. Boege, Mrs. Mary T. Derosier, Mrs.
Annie Harrington, Lena B?.uer, Lizzie
Anderson, Lillie Biggs, Mary: F. McDon
ough, Margaret Conway, Salma Swenson

o'clock the Third Artillery band struck
up a march, and the Native Daughters,
together with many of the members of
South San Francisco Parlor of the Native
Sons of the Golden West as partners,
took part in the grand march, in which
many others also joined. During inter

Play Fast Ball, Easily
Defeating Men; Prom
Sacramento.
Hughes and Waddell Will
, Oppose Each Other
To*"Deiv,
The Senators lined up against the Ail-
American wonders yesterday at Recrea
tion grounds and politely accepted the
usual defeat which seems the lot of the
native talent to receive. The game was .
fast and snappy, occupying but an hour
and twenty-five minutes of play. Win
Mercer, the Washington twirler, was on
the slab for the big leaguers, opposed by |
Stricklett. Mercer was a mystery all
through the game, except in the first
inning. Stricklett's offerings were grace
fully accepted, nine of them being
pounded in safe places. The great
Lajoie had his lamps In better order than
heretofore and swatted the ball three out
of four times at bat.
The Senators began to do business at
the outset, but the pace was too warm.
They had to drop by the wayside after
the first inning. Stanley opened hostili
ties with a rattling two-bagger and
Courtney walked. Both were advanced
on Davis' out to pitcher and first. ,
"Truck" Eagan's hot single scored them.
This was all that Sacramento could do, as
Mercer was too much after the opening
round.
The visitors scored three runs in the
third. Sullivan was hit by a pitched
ball. Mercer took four bad ones and
PicKering was safe on a "fielder's choice,'^
tilling the bases. Sullivan arrived on
Stanley's error and Mercer followed suit
on th< throw in from right field of Fras
er's tl. . Pickering then scored on Lajoie s
single.
The Ail-Americans scored their last two
runs in the next round on three consecu
tive hits by Irwin, Bradley and Mercer.
Bradley's and Irwin's- were good for two
stations each. After that there was
nothing doing, though both sides had
men on the bases.
Courtney fielded in brilliant fashion,
lie had six chances, none of them being
easy, and accepted them In a clever
manner. The infield work of both Brad
ley and Lajoie was fast, while Pickering
gave his usual exhibition of brilliant work
in the left garden. Barrett also distin
guished himself by nailing one out by the
flagpole. ...
This morning at Oakland the Eastern
ers will do another turn with Swing's
crippled band. At Recreation Park this
afternoon the Senators will be given an
other chance to display their prowess.
Jay Hughes, the old Sacramento favorite,
will officiate in the box for them, while
the great "Rube" Waddell will do the
tossing for the stars. The score:

THE SAN-FRANCISCO CALL"; SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1901;
ANDRISA, RIDDEN BY J. WOODS,
WINS TRUXTON BEALE STAKE
C=-ntÂ«>l HE brilliantly. won victory of An-
I drisa in the Truxton Beale handi-
I cap, sporting the popular colors of
11 Walter Jennings, one ot the larg
est crowds of the season and the
sound drubbing administered the books
were the. salient features of a splendid
day's sport yesterday -at Oakland.
Incidentally the magnificent work of
Winnie O'Connor should not; be omitted,
Jack Featherstone's rider piloting three
winners and having his chances in the
stake ruined by some unforeseen racing
luck. To be sure, the handicap over a
mile and worth 51300 overshadowed the
other events, and the ten starters^almost
represented the pick' of the horses in
training. Shouldering top weight, 12
pounds, Autolight, the Morris entry, rid
den, by O'Connor, closed â¢ equal favoritÂ«
with Andrisa, looking nicely "in" at 105
and having Johnny Woods at. the helm.
Varro, Rosormonde, Beau Ormonde, Ber
nota and Doublet were all admitted to
have outside chances and helped make
the speculating good.
Horses Sent Away Evenly.
Jake Holtman, after only a slight de
lay, sent the bunch away prettily aligned.
Doublet, Varro, Bernota and Beau Or
monde at once went out setting a warm
clip, with Woods, on Andrisa, right at
their heel3. Into the stretch Hoar had
Varro in front, closely trailed by Bernota
and Andrisa, while about three lengths
tack O'Connor, on Autolight, was strain
ing his eyes for a way out of the pocket
he found himself in. Woods, astride An
drisa, had clear sailing and gradually
running Varro down, won by half a
length in 1:40%, with Rosormonde on the
outside at his saddle skirts. Autolight,
under hard pressure, finished a goou
fourth. :â¢ . - â 
AVhile but three favorites tramped in
first, Lizzella, Old England and Diomed
were all well backed and the books were
fearfully scorched, scarcely one escaping
the bombardment. O'Connor is- always
th*e rage with a holiday crowd,- and as all
of his mounts were quoted at juicy odds
this fact contributed greatly to the ring s
losses. : . '
Hiles Best in the Sprint.
Developments showed that Hilee, the
even money favorite for the opening
sprint, was pounds the best. Mounce was
almost left at the post and then gradually
skirting around his field, won with some
thing to spare. Maresa took the place
from David S. t each being well played.
Nearly half a dozen hot ones were un
corked in the maiden two-year-old event.
Charley Patterson, trainer for Burns &
Waterhouse, thought San Nicholas, a
black colt by Imp. Reggie, "oil from the
can." With Spencer up he went to the
post favorite at 2 to 1. Old England, from
the Morris stable, was also highly touted,
notwithstanding which his price went
Irom 2 to i El Chihuahua also came in
for a strong play. Woods, ort the latter,
got away first at the start, but did not
hold the lead long, being passed by both
San Nicholas and Old England. In a long,
hard drive Old England, under O'Connor's
vigorous riding, outlasted the favorite,
scoring by a neck in 1:01%. Away on equal
terms with the winner San Nicholas
would have won.
Ex-Jockey Johnny Weber's old mare,
Lizzella, piloted by O'Connor and 6 to 1 In
the betting, captured the mile and a quar
ter run in handy fashion. Obia, from P.
Ryan's stable, had a decided call in the
ring, but was beaten before a mile had
been covered, and ran unplaced. O'Connor
made his move on the stretch turn and
taking the lead from Galanthus finished
two lengths before Horton at the wire.
The show went to Herculean. :: ,
No doubt the unprepossessing races run
by Green Morris' big colt Homestead
caused the books to lay 8 to 5 and 2 to >1
against his chances in the Berkeley hand
icap, at six and a half furlongs. Jos'.e G
did her best, but after O'Connor on Home
stead had tired galloping in behind the
bunch he shook his mount up- and beat
the filly at leisure. The Giver did not lack
speed, running a fair third.
Diomed did his best for the amusement
of the crowd in front of the stand at the
start for thp last event. He reared up on
his hind legs and finally succeeded in
dumping Vittatoe. Then he ran riderle33
down to the head of the stretch before
stopping. He had been well played and
his actions so pleased the bookies that
some of them chalked 10 to 1 against the
red iron horse. Vittatoe remounted, and,,
getting away fairly well, ran around his
field and won "at the finish hands down
from the favorite, Commonwealth Attor
ney. Lost Girl, after cutting quite a fig
ure but in the lead, ran third.
Track Notes.
Seventeen booking firms laid odds.
George Rose and Frank Lanterman
swelled the list.
Pat Dunne, whose green jacket with
white cap is familiar to all Western turf
goers, was a spectator yesterday.' Mr.
Dunne's trip to California this winter is
one of pleasure only, his horses being
Siven a well earned rest In the South.
"Longshot" Conley is here and will
again be seen in the saddle. " . â  .â 
â  Bookmaker Joe Rose managed to part
with over 52000 of his bank roll.
O'Connor indulged in some very rough
riding through the stretch in the handi
cap. If he gets in a pocket that is his
own lookout, and Winnie should not ex
pect boys to pull out when their own
horses are not beaten.

MISS WILSON
A FAST HOUND
O. Zahl's Courser "Wins
the Open Event
Card at Union Park To-Day
Is Made Up of Many >
Champions.
Otto Zanl's fast courser Miss "Wilson
won the 3G-dog open stake- yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. She defeated H.
Lynch's Lilac pointless in the deciding
course.' Though the contestants in the
stake are hot looked upon as champions,
they were forced to do some hard cours
ing In the pursuit of the lively hare3.
Heavy scoring was the rule, and the
bunch of relief doga on hand was kept
busy helping the dogs in the stake.
The talent had a great day and guessea
all but four winners throughout the
stake. Early in the day the wise ones
figured Miss Wilson to win the final and
played their judgment quite heavily. As
a result a long line cashed at the long
odds book. â¢ . , ...
In the. final Miss "Wilson was a legiti
mate favorite and should have been at
strong odds, but the talent, well down on
Zahl's dog for stake honors, protected
themselves on Lilac and cut the price con
siderably. . . â¢ ..
The open stake for to-day is made up of
class coursers, many of them recognized
champions. ! The talent is strongly in fa
vor of Palo Alto for the stake. Geary's
dog is against Shadow in the first round,
and because of his phenomenal speed will
lead and beat him on a straightaway
hare. Shadow Is a close worker, and with
a fast hare to score on will outpoint Palo
Alto if the champion shows a desire to
hesitate on the game.
Sacramento Boy is in fine condition and
is a likely candidate for final honors.
Likely winners in to-day's stake are:
Master Claire. Faraway, Roman Athlete,
Auckland, Loyal Lad. Shadow. Silver
Cloud, Harlean Gladys, Flora McDonald.
Fine Form, "Warship, Merrlmac, Haphaz
ard, A. J. Martin, Sir Lawrence, "Vandal,

PETIT FORGER
UNDER ARREST
Makes Business of Pass
ing Fictitious
Checks.
Victims in This City and
Eastern States Are
' H. H. Hansen appeared before JniÂ»J
Mogan yesterday on the felony charged^
passing a- fictitious check on E. A. Huute
mann, a butcher at 421 Tu^s street. Han
aen was instructed and arraigned and the
case continued until December 17. A sim
ilar charge was preferred against the
prisoner by John Bellmer of the firm oÂ£
Kruse & Bellmer, grocers, Turk and Lar
kin streets. Harsen represented to them
that he waa president of the Pacific Cigar
Company, with offices in the Donohoe
building. The police say other business
men have been swindled by Hansea in the
same way.
Captain Seymour has received informa
tion from the East that Hansen. who has
a number of aliases, and M. R. Allen,
alias Truman Nye, who was arrested in
this city on a charge of forgery commit
ted in Kansas City and was sentenced
there to five years' Imprisonment on De
cember 5, were partners in crime and were
looked upon as two of the cleverest crooks
in the country. Their scheme- was to call
upon business men, representing them
selves as agents for same largQ Eastern
house, and pass bogus checks on tnÂ»
strength of that representation.
Hansen is known in the East as Frank
Hurlbert, alias Marvin A. Barringer,
alias "W. H. McDonald, alias Martin Al
len. On July 27, 1896, he was arrested in
'Chicago for conspiring to defraud, but
was nolle prosequied. On September 26
following he was arrested there on
charges of swindling, and some of the
cases are still pending against him. On
November 29, lSi)7, he- was received at the
McCloud Reformatory. Minnesota, for fcer
gery in the second degree, from llia^
apolis, was paroled November 27, 1x3,
and discharged March 11, 1899. He was ar
rested in St. Louis on June 9, 1SD9, for
passing bogus checks and was sentenced
to six months in the workhouse. On Janu
ary 9, 1900, he was sentenced to ninety
days in prison at St. Paul, Minn., for mis
demeanor embezzlement, and on March 15
of this year he was arrested in Milwaukee
for passing bogus checks. He waa re
leased on bail and fled. He is still wanted
there.
He was next heard of in Detroit, Mich.,
where he was arrested September 4 on a
charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses. The complaining witness refused
to prosecute him and he was discharged.
He came here with Allen about two
months ago and i3 now under arrest for
passing fictitious checks. Captain Sey
mour has notified the Milwaukee and Chi
cago officials of his arrest.

AMERICA FIRST
FOR COMMERCE
Carnegie Praises Trade
Advances of United
States."
Ironmaster Speaks at Corner
stone-Laying in New
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â Andrew Carnegie
was the principal speaker to-day at [ the
laying of the cornerstone of the new High
School of Comrherce. This is the first free
High School of Commerce in this country.
Carnegie said in part:
"This school is the pioneer High School
of Commerce in New York or in the coun
try, and it owes "its creation to the fact
that the United . States has become the
leading commercial nation in the export
of its * products, even Great Britain ap
pearing now second. The exports of our
agricultural products have long been first
among the nations, but recently we have
entered into competition with them In
manufactured articles, which we formerly
had to import for our own wants. We
are ultimately to be the greatest manu
facturer and exporter of manufactured
articles in the world, as we have long
been of food products, and such schools
of commerce have become an imperative
necessity in the great seaport of the
Union."
The building as now planned will give
accommodations to from 1200 to 1500 pu
pils, who will be given instruction in
every branch of knowledge tending to fit
them for the world of commerce and
finance. The structure will cost upward of
$300,000. It will be ready for occupancy in
about eighteen months. It Is the outcome
of the efforts of the Chamber of Com
merce and the trustees of Columbia Uni
versity.

GIVE THE THEATER
TO THE DALY ESTATE
British Lords Settle a Controversy
Over Possession of a London
Playhouse.
LONDON. Dec. 14.â The House of Lords
has unanimously decided the case for the
possession of Daly's Theater here in favor
of the Daly estate. Newton Crane, who
is counsel for the Daly estate, said to
day that the decision not only gives the
Daly heirs possession of the theater, but
awards them about Â£20,000 accumulated
in court as their share of the takings of
"San Toy."
The balance of the leasehold is worth
about Â£30,000. In addition there will be
an accounting for damages. George Ed
warde's contract with the Daly estate to
produce musical plays at the theater is
still in force and is not affected by the
result of the suit.

ADMITS THE SHORTAGE
IN ESTATE'S ACCOXTNTS
Former Public Administrator Young:
of Sonoma County May Be
<" Prosecuted.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 14.â Former Public
Administrator Thomas G. Young was
brought before Superior Judge Dougherty
this morning, under contempt proceedings
for not obeying the order of the court of
November 25, requiring him to deposit
with the County Treasurer $3200 belong
ing to the estate of the late James Porter.
Young testified that while he was in of
fice* he had kept the moneys of all estates
administered upon by him in a common
fund, and th4t In settling with the Treas
urer there was a shortage of $3200. Judge
Dougherty held that as Young did not
have that sum in his final accounting he
could not comply. with the Brder of the
court. The contempt proceedings were
therefore dismissed.
The. District , Attorney would not say
whether Young and his bondsmen would
be sued to recover the alleged shortage,
but in all probability both civil and crim
inal, proceedings will be instituted.
The estate in which the shortage occurs
is that of James Porter, an aged man,
who was burned to death in his cottage
several years ago. He had no relatives,
and an estate of $3600 was administered
upon by Public Administrator Young. .

NEW ENTRANCE
SYSTEM CHOSEN
Changes by University
in Preparatory Re
quirements.
Scheme Permits of Greater
Freedom , in Selecting
Study List.
BERKELEY, Dec\ 14.â The academic
council of the University of California has
decided upon a new system of entrance
requirements . for the general culture
courses at Berkeley which will tend
toward greater freedom for students and
for California high schools in selecting
their preparatory courses. It provides
that students shall be admitted on ex
actly the same terms to the college of
letters, social sciences and natural sci
ences. It frees the student from the neces
sity of choosing a college course while in
the high school as the same preparation
will fit him for either scientific or clas
sical work at Berkeley.
The new system will not be enforced
until 1906. but henceforth any student may
register under it if he chooses. Three of
the fifteen units required for admission
are made purely elective. Under the new
plan the uniform requirements for admis
sion to the three colleges above named
are as follows Cone unit represents five
recitations a wedk for one year):
- English, 2 units; Greek or modern languages,
2, Latin, 3; mathematics, 2; history, 2; physics.
1; elective, C.
Under this system a student may enter
the. college of letters with no preparatory
Greek and only three years of Latin.
The council's report continues:
The student who enters the College of Social
Sciences will, as for admission to the College
oC Letters, offer either French or German or
elementary Greek. . Advanced English may no
longer be offered Instead of French or German,
but as a free elective. One year of history
must be offered In addition to civil govern
ment. One year of advanced Latin Is made an
elective. â â¢
Formerly for admission to the College of
Natoral Sciences four years of French and
German, together, could be offered Instead of
four years of Latin. Now that the entrance
requirements are the same for all three . col
leges three years of Latin will be required,
and, In addition, either French or German or
elementary Greek. An additional -year of his
tory will be required. This chanH will affect
very few people, as not more than twenty-five
students receive degrees annually, on the aver
age, from the College of Natural Sciences out
of a total, of 275- graduates, and of these
twenty-five more than half have had prepara
tory Latin.
English history is added to the group of sub
jects that may be offered as units in history.
Required mathematics Is reduced from 2V, to
2 units.
The academic council has been working
a year upon the changes just effected.

THERE IS NO SUCH CONDITION AS SEXUAL, "WEAKNESS" IN A KAN OTHER-
wise strong and robust, and If the following facts ara understood, be may realize tuÂ»
uselessness of treating it as such. . -
.Anatomy and Physiology teach us that the Prostate gland, so-called neck of the bladder,
is the very center of the reproductive system In the male. Inflammation of any organ In-
variably causes disordered function of that organ and symptoms peculiar to the organ in-
I flamed arise. It should, be apparent that the Prostate, when damaged by long continued and
! too often repeated excitement or the harmful influence exercised by an ill-treated contracted
disorder, that disordered function must result. Congestion of the Prostate, by these factors,
is so long kept up that it finally becomes localized as a chronic affection and a catarrhal con-
dition ' of the ejaculatcry and prostatlc ducts establishes itself. The first symptoms polnttnjr
to this prostatic disorder are referable to the reproductive system-- It is first notice 1 thac
patients suffering from this disease are embarrassed by "Too Quickness." This Is invari-
ably followed. If cure Is not affected, by all those symptoms known as "weakness."
. The greater number of patients suffering from this "weakness" are healthy, robunt men
in every other respect,, men who possibly â¢ have been treated with tonics, electricity, etc..
â¢ for a "weakness, which, if the above has been made clear, will bo understood never to have
existed. Some years ago we called the. attention of the medical profession and others to thÂ«
fact that the above well defined disorders were not weaknesses, but symptoms, results of in-
' flSmmation, and that stomach drugging could not cure, but procedures directed toward repair-
Ing the damage always proved successful, as Indicated immediately by Increased circulation
and renewed strength. I The adoption of this plan of treatment by the profession Is- proof of
Its correctness. Colored chart of the organs sent sealed in plain wrapper free on application.
All V<;ricoceles Should B- Cured.
Varicocele is. an enlargement of th.e most vital blood ve3sels in man. The functions of

disease consists of dllitatlon and local stagnation of blood. As a result we find sometime*

sold, but loaned, and are expected 'to be returned iri gooJ order when

CARBOLIC ACID
ENDS HER LIFE
Young Wife Meets Death
From the Effects of '/
Poison.
Whether Deed Was Suicidal
or Accidental Is Not
Determined.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Dec. 14.
Whether by design or by accident. Mrs.
Mae Bee Bernett, 20 years old. drank a
fatal draught of carbolic acid last night
at her residence on Verno avenue. Linda
Vista terrace. Her body was found in bed
at 7 o'clock this morning by Herman Ber
nett, her husband, to whom the young
wife had been wedded two years. He had
been sleeping with their baby, which is a
month old, in another apartment.
The husband and hiÂ» wife's relatives at
the house declare the poison must have
been taken by mistake. Mrs. Bernett had
been In ill health and under treatment by
Dr. Legault since the baby was born, la
her bedroom on a bureau was medlcina
she had been using. Yesterday afternoon
the husband took home a six-ounce vial
of carbolic add, to be used In a wash for
the Infant. The botle was placed on a
stand near the medicine vial.
Last evening about 9 o'clock Bernett
says he told his wife he would take the
Infant to another apartment, that the In
valid spouse might enjoy a night of un
broken rest.
Neither Bernett nor his mother, who oc
cupied a third bedroom, heard a sound
during the night. "When he entered his
wife's room this morning he found her
body face downward on the bed, with the
poison half-gone from the bottle. Thera
was nothing to determine whether the in
valid had committed suicide or had taken
the poison by mistake.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of the
case and an inquest will be held. Mrs.
Bernett was a native of Crawfordsville.
Ind. Her mother, -Mrs. Wilson, resides at
Myrtle Point. Or. An aunt, Mrs. C. u.
Frank, has her home In this city, and a
cousin, W. B. Pickett, dwells In Berkeley.
The husband is a linotype operator.

OIL PRODUCERS
FIND NEW HOPE
Promise of Solution of
Their Problem Is
Held Out.
The oil producers of ' California have
now arrived at the most Interesting time
In their career. The Associated Oil Com
pany has reached the point where many
oil companies are about to submit to their
stockholders the proposition to merge
their Interests and to sink their identity
as individuals In one corporation of great
strength. Some of the oil-producing com
panies have already sanctioned the plan,
seeing In it the only seeming chance there
is to prevent the producers from endlessly
continuing the ruinous competition that
has been progressing for many months,
and which has resulted in a price for oil
that Is ridiculously low. considering that
oil has to compete only with high-priced
coal.
Some companies will vote by stockhold
ers on the Associated Oil Company's prop
osition in January. Others will find out
what their stockholders think by vote
taken In February. In the next eight or
ten weeks the future of the oil Industry
of California for a considerable period
will hence be determined.
The action that has already been taken
by stockholders of companies that have
put the matter to the test of a vote would
.-eem to indicate that the combination
that Is sought will be accomplished. A pool
cf the product of Southern I California
wells, while retaining the lndidvidual or
ganizations of the several companies, has
been faithfully tried and the trial has re
sulted In failure to keep up the price of
oil, although there was temporary relief.
Los Angeles and the Kern River country
oil-producing districts are in the same
condition In the matter of having a large
surplus of oil for which a market has
not yet been found.
Locks Favorably on Combine.
"When the Kern River district field was
opened Los Angeles lost the Ban Fran
cisco market, which has since been large
ly in the hands of the producers of Kern
County. Los Angeles looks favorably on
the combine of the Associated Oil Com
pany for the reason that a raise of the
price for the Kern County product would
help all along the line.
The contracts which have been placed
by the Standard Oil Company in the East
for steamships to bo used for the trans
portation of crude petroleum call for ves
sels that are 250. feet long and will have
a minimum capacity of 1,500,000 gallons
each. Not an American steamer is now
engaged in the European oil trade. The
Cramps have the contract for building the
petroleum carriers. The National Oil Re
porter says that the expenditure of sev
eral millions of dollars is called for as the
price to be paid for the vessels.
The National Banker of Chicago has a
remedy for the unloading, of valueless oil
stocks upon unsuspecting Eastern pur
chasers. Its proposition is that prospect
ive buyers should find out the exact loca
tions of the company and the character of
the company's land; the amount of capital
stock and what proportion the treasury
stock bears to that capital and what fin
ancial Interest the promoters and the
stockholders have contributed; Quantity
of oil and production of the wells of the
company seeking to sell stock. "There are
a good many companies," says the,Bank
er, "that have not even a derrick up, but
the financial test Is their management
and location." How the people are to as
certain these facts Is not set forth.
Pennsylvania Fields Active.
According to the report of the Oil City
Derrick there were 766 new wells com
pleted In the Pennsylvania field In the
month of November. There were then 1049
rigs and drilling wells, an increase being
shown of 54 wells and 563 barrels new pro
duction. In Ohio and Indiana fields 541
wells were completed. The new produc
tion was 8621 barrels, and there were six
ty-one dry holes. At the end of the month
there were C54 rigs and drilling wells being
operated, a decline of thirty-four. - -
The tankage in the Kern River district
amounts to 1,296,000 barrels, -which is dis

MINERS BEGIN
SEASON'S WORK
California and Sister
States Are Delving
Eagerly.
Close Observers Cffer New-
Suggestions to the Ore
'''-" Seekers.
The indications all continue to be favor
able for an excellent mining season in
California. Activity is increasing in Ne
vada under the stimulus of the successes
at Tonopah. Searchlight, Wedekind and
other localities. Interest is shown in Ore
gon, and Arizona properties , by Eastern
moneyed men. On the Mother Lode and
in other localities in this State work is
progressing: satisfactorily. Of the opera
tions in the vicinity of the Mother .Lode
the Stockton Independent says:
Everyone along the Mother Lode ia happy as
the mines are -opening at- a lively rate these
days. The rains have greatly increased the
supply or water. Streams which have been
dry a good part of the summer arc carrying
considerable water and reservoirs are filling
up at a fast rate. Idle miners are being put
to work, which means that all- business In
the mountains will thrive for months. Out
side capital is taking a hand in mining now
and many new claims will be opened.
The resumption cf work at the Utica group
of mines was one of . the events of the year
at Angels. With about COO men out of work
the effect on business was noticeable, but when
the machinery started up again all of the bus
winter Is anticipated. Thousands of tons of
ore will be taken out of these claims. Tho
announcement of two big strikes in. the Gold
Hill and Duchess mines has caused considerable
rejoicing, not alone among the owners of theso
properties, but the people in the vicinity. An
Oakland company has commenced exploiting
a quartz vein within a mile or Vallecito and
much interest is being taken in the work. A
big mining boom Is predicted for that town.
Miners Seek Protection.
According to the statements contained
in a. memorial cent by the American
miners in Manila to Congress there are
between 1550 and 2000 miners in the Phil
ippine Islands, the- greater number of
whom are ex-soldiers. They are -working
In the hills, prospecting or perfecting
their claims, and they ask the Govern
ment at Washington to extend the Amer
ican mining laws to the Philippines. Un
less this is done, so the memorial sets
forth, the conditions now existing aro
such as to- practically prevent the devel
opment of mines. The text of the reso
lution adopted by the miners, signed by
J. B. Early as president and Robert Mills
as secretary, is as follows:
Resolved. That we, the American prospectors
and miners, -now in- session in the cfty of Ma
nila, do hereby resolve and petition the Con
gress of the United States to pass an act ex
tending the liberal mining- laws of the United
States to the Philippine Islands and to recog
nize- their claims now located, and that the
Civil Governor and the Philippine Commission
be requested to embody a copy of these reso
lutions in their report to. Congress, and that the
Philippine- Commission recommend to Con
gress that the United States mining laws be
extended to said islands, and that a copy of
these resolutions be sent to the Civil Governor
of the Philippine Islands, to the Philippine
Commission to the President of the United
States, to the Secretary of the Interior to the
Congress of the United States, and to such
individual members of Congress as may be
reached by mall
Decision Makes Precedent.
The Mining and Scientific Press urges
that the decision of tho Board of Railroad
Commissioners of the State of California
in the oil rate case establishes a prece
dent under which the high charges for
transportation that have hampered the
mining industry, of this State can be in
quired into. In a review of the proceed
ings and practical application of the facts
to further its conclusions the Press says:
Tha commission has ignored, ' as irrelevant
and immaterial, the mass of, testimony put
before it as to freight charges on other 1 com
modities between the eajne points or other
points .Accepting the outside statements of
the railroad companies themselves as to the
cost of the service, and basing tho rate they
order on it, the only possible question that
could now bo raised by the railroads would
be as to the reasonableness of the profit mar
gin the order allows. This the commission In
its formal opinion says is.. 44 V& per cent. This
percentage is greater than the average earn
ing of all its freight traffic as shown by the
annual statements of. operation of the roads.
The last opinion and order of the commission
Is in form and substance an improvement on
the one It replaces. It not only Improves the
condition of the petroleum Industry to the
extent of thÂ» reduction, but its method of
reaching conclusions establishes a precedent
under which the commission can â  examine in
telligently Into freight charges made on other
commodities and can correct them when proved
inequitable. The way would seem clearly
opened for securing to the miners of California
an equitable, ralr establishment of freight rates
on ores. In which there Is much inequality,
Tho railroads running out of Cripple Creek
Colo., have recently on their own initiative
put Into effect fiat rates on" ore independent of
Its commodity value. There Is no logical rea
son why this should not be the established
rule in California. The California Railroad
Commission would have to reverse its own pre
cedent in ordering into effect rates based on
values of metal contents.
Suggest Profits in Silver.
ThÂ© Lovelocks (Nev.) Tribune figures
out how silver mining may. be again
found profitable in Nevada, The principal
point in its -argument- Is that prices of
materials have. been reduced and that
modern mining ! processes are sufficiently
economical to warrant the statements
that it makes. - As to the cost of mate
rials the following allegations are made
by the Tribune:
T.JZ*. i â¦J nak t. a . few comparisons of the
Kl cea Â°, f f tte principal commodities used In
silver mining then and now. These figures are
taken from authentic records, furnished from
reliable sources, and represent cost delivered at
the mines:
Powder, former price 85c per pound, now
15c: fuse, formerly Â«2 60 per 100 feet, now 85c;
caps, formerly $2 60, per 100. now 85c: can
dles, formerly $7 50 per box, now $2 60; picks,
formerly . $2 50, now $1; shovels, formerly $2
each, now S5c: hammers, formerly $2 60, now
S5c; ; Dick and drill steel, formerly 25c per
pound, now lie; track iron, formerly $200 ner
mon, now $60: mine timbers, formely $125 per
M, -now $35; blacksmith coal, formerly 10c per
pound, now 4c. Water and air pipe are now
procurable at about 25 per cent of their former
cost.
Now we will make a few comparisons of the
relative cost of ;tbe expenses in connection with
the milling of sliver ores, â¢ assuming that these
same ores would-be subjected: to the same
treatment, necessitating the use of the same
chemicals that were in 'use thirty years ago
which is not the case by aily means. Simpler
and lesu expensive methods are being used at
the present dayâ the result of 'strides in the
science of metallurgy for the Intervening thirty
years â which we will not take -into considera
tion. â¢ â¢
Quicksilver, former price at mills $125 per
flask of seventy-two pounds, now $55.
Bluestone, former price' 25c per pound, now
Sc. â 
Salt, of which -a considerable quantity was
used, was gathered In an impure state from
the salt marshes and fed to the mills without
first beine refined, increasing the milling cost
in this item, since the salt crust rarely con
tained over 35 per cent of salt, to about three
times what it should have, been, not to speak
of the fxtra cost of running through" the 'mill
the 65 per cent of waste contained In the crude
Ealt cake. The Impure article cost $25 per
ton; now the pure rock salt Is obtainable for
$20 per ton. Other 'chemicals of minor im
portance are to be had at about 40 per cent of
their former cost.
The cost of power, tho principal milling Item,
formerly about $1 50. per horsepower for every
twenty-four hours, can now be had for about
40c. And tlie same Dower In the same tlma
will reduce more ore than formerly on account
of the greater efficiency of modern mills.
With the progress that is being made in the
use of hydro-carbons as fuel for generating
steam, the cost of mill power will admit of
much greater reduction than the price named
as the present cost. On the^ whole, the milling
cost of reducing -ores would be less than 40
per cent of the former cost. -. ..
Assessment Work Defined.
A. H. Ricketts contributes a definition
to the Mining and Engineering Review of
"what constitutes legal assessment work
on mining. claims." Some extracts are
taken therefrom as follows: '
Until a United State* .patent shall have been
issued for any claim not less than $100 worth

when the price.jof a mining claim has been
paid to the Government the equitable rights

MANY ELEGANT
HOMES ERECTED
Work of Continental
Building and Loan
Association.
Question of Rent Is Solved"
By Many Hundred
â â  â . Workers. 'â '}
The question of providing homes for
their families is one that has confronted
the wage-earners of the land more than
once. The system of rent, though indis
pensable in -.the great -economic plan
which guides human affairs, is an onerous
system, and to it many a worker may at
tribute his failure to provide a permanent
shelter for his loved ones. The question,
then, of utilizing money to the advantage
of the' spender, when considered in the.
matter of rent, assumes an importance
which the careful man of affairs will not
find.it profitable to Ignore.
, To the wage-earner who pays a stipu
lated sum each month for the sheltering
of his family the future holds little; hope
In store. It is the ambition of most men
to own the roof which shelters ! them
against storm and protects them from the
inclemencies of fickle nature. How to se
cure such a convenience upon a stated in
come has been the great problem, which
men found it difficult to overcome. | But
the advent into industrial life of the; plan
of paying for privileges on the installment
plan has solved the question. Since this
plan has been introduced in California
thousands of workingmen have had sub
stantial cause for congratulating them
selves that it is a success. They . have
found that the phantom- of rent, which
in previous years sapped their vitality,
has been downed, and that the money
paid; out by them in this manner when
applied in another and more legitimate
way has yielded them golden returns.
The Continental Building and. Loan As
sociation is one of the largest concerns in
California which makes a specialty of
dealing with wage-earners who are de
sirous of securing homes for themselves.
This' corporation, with its immense- sub
scribed capital of $13,000,000, has proved
itself a boon to thousands of men, be
cause through its admirable system they
found it possible to secure homes on the
payment of monthly sums very much
smaller than what they were paying m
the way of rent. By the system of loans,
which is the greatest feature of the op
erations of the Continental Building and
Loan Association, many owners of homes
have been relieved of the cares of the
future, and to-day they are practically
independent. Thanks to this corporation,
which placed "it in their power to secure
permanent shelters at comparatively
small cost, they are protected against the
importunities of landlordism, and while
life lasts are immune from the-inconve
niences which are the daily experiences
of those who do not possess their own
homes. ' â¢ ' ' . â 
The number of dwellings erected by the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion for its members now exceeds 1000.
The' association was established in 1889,
and its success since that time has been
remarkable. Its motto, "Do not pay
rent, but make your rent pay for your
home," has proved to be the keynote to
success, so that to-day its monthly in
comers $150,000. Its assets have grown to
the phenomenal figure . of $2,100,000â a
showing made by no other similar concern
in California. Not only in San Francisco,
but in other parts of the State, happy
families are . to be found who owe their
prosperity to .their association with this
concern. Beautiful and palatial homes,
showing In all their appointments the
comfort and material happiness of their
owners, 'stand in every quarter of the citv
as monuments to the conservatism and
enterprise of the men to whose opera
tions the success of the Continental Build
ing and Loan Association is chiefly due.
The affairs of the association are ably
conducted by Captain Oliver Eldridge
president, and "William Corbin, secretary
and general manager. To those who are
seeking for detailed knowledge concern
ing the methods of the concern and for
information of the greatest value to
homeseekers interviews with either of the
gentlemen named will be of profit. The of
fices of the association are at 222 Sansome
street, and the elegance of their equip
ment fully attests the success with which
all the operations of the association and
its members have met.

Expositions Are to Re

Portland and Great Falls Plan
Celebrations of Much
Interest.
Special Dispatch to Th% Call.
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. 14.â In 1905 two
great Western expositions will call the
attention of the country to the centen
nial anniversary of the westward journey
of those famous pioneers, Captain Clark
and Captain Lewis, from whom this coun
try took its name.
One of these celebrations will be held
in Great Falls and the other at Portland,
Or. The former city Is situated at the
falls of the Missouri River, which spot
engaged tho attention of these heroic men
more than any other between St. Louis,
Mo., their starting point on that memora
ble journey, and the mouth of the Co
lumbia, where their famous expendition
ended.
It Is related that the Lewis and Clark
expedition stayed at the Missouri Falls
for thirty days, making: a complete topo
graphical map thereof to present to Presi
dent Jefferson. That map remains to-day
one of the most accurate ever made of
that section. An effort will be made to
erect â¢ a monument to their memory at
Great Falls in connection with this cele
bration.
The celebration at Portland in the same
year, beginning in the month of July, will
take more of the form of an exposition.
Governor Toole has written to the inter
ested parties in Portland to the effect
that Montana â will participate -with them
in the affair, although he believes It
should properly occur in this State.
Lewis and Clark got their first glimpse
of the Rockies in Montana. They discov
ered the source of the Missouri and named
its three branches ivladison, Gallatin and
Jefferson, which three names are further
commemorated as titles of counties in
this State to-day. It is difficult to form
an estimate of the importance of the
Lewis and Clark expedition in the history
of the great West.

GROWTH OF SHIPBUILDING
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA
Formidable and Stanch Line of Battleships, Splendid and
, Swift Passenger Vessels and Commodious Carriers Are
Among the Achievements of Plants on the Pacific Coast
A great industry connected immediately
with the promotion of tho commerce of
this port is shipbuilding. In that art the
builders who have yards on . the shel
tered bays of California have no su
periors. The fame of the great battle
ships that have been launched . into the
waters of San Francisco Bay is interna
tional. They have already become the
themes for song and story. While Amer
ican history lasts the fame of the Olym
pia, and what she did at Manila' Bay, and
of the Oregon, and her wonderful trip
around .Cape Horn and her leading part
in the battle off Santiago, will inspire
Americans with pride of native land.
Many other vessels of war for this Gov
ernment and many huge ships used in
commerce had their keels laid here. â  In
building the battleship down to the
smallest craft that sails or steams, San
Francisco has alike gained the confidence
of the men who go down to the sea in
ships, for the requirements of all sorts
of service have been amply met and ex
pectation has been rewarded with satis
factory performance.
In the early days all the ships and
other large vessels that came through the
Golden Gate were, necessarily, built
abroad. There were no large plants here
capable of producing the larger carriers.
Tho principal development of the ship
building industry of this port has taken
place within the past two decades. Coin
cident to the advance in this line of tho
period indicated, other attendant facili
ties have been provided. There are dry
docks here that are. capable of hauling up
the greatest carriers of commerce. Other
huge docks are in construction at Hunters
Point and at Mare Island, the latter, of
course, being under the direction and at
the cost of the Government, and being do
vised for the use of the naval vesseis of
the United States.
The list of new vessels documented at
the San Francisco Custom-house has
steadily lengthened in the past few years.
The Custom-house list for the, calendar
year of 19o0 contained mention of only
twelve vessels that were documented
here that were not built in California.
The list of the present year will show a
like leadership of California shipyards in
the output of craft of various descrip
tions. Everywhere the names are known
of the Union Iron "Works, the Risdon
Iron Works, the Fulton Engineering and
Shipbuilding Works and of many other
During the past few years a great im
pulse has been given to the shipping in
dustries of San Francisco in common with
the general advance in prosperity of the
Paciric Coast. Shipbuilding has shared in
the general good times that business men
have known. Among the larger vesseis
turned out of California yards for pur
poses of commerce in the past few years
are the following passenger ships: Pomo
na, 1540, tons gross; Peru, 5000 tons gross;
Senator, 2200 tons gross; St. Paul, 22<W tons
gross; Helen, 700 tons gross; Spokane, 1350
tons grossâ all these being the product of
the Union Iron Works. The same estab
lishment has turned out the large freight
ships the Californian, of 6000 tons gross;
the Alaskan, 11,000 tons gross, and the
Arizonan, which is a sister ship of the
Alaskan. From the same yards have also
come the ferry-boats Berkeley, Brooklyn,
San Pablo and Tamalpais, the last named
being the output of the present year. The
tugboats Active, Collis, Fearless, Waliula,
Sadie, Union and Izabal were also built
at the Union Iron Works.
The list of the vessels documented to
date for the present calendar year is not
complete. Large craft are on the ways
that have not been finished, and the build
ing of them will have accordingly to bo
credited to next year when the record Is
officially made up.
The gross and net tonnage of all new
vessels documented at this port in recent
years has been as follows:

A fleet of war vessels, formidable in
itself, has been constructed at this port,
at the Union Iron Works. The list of such
craft included the Charleston. San Fran
cisco, Monterey, Olympia, Oregon, Wheel
ing, Cruiser No. 6, Marietta, Farragut,
Iroquois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Wyoming, the
torpedo-boat destroyers Paul Jones,
Perry and . Preble and the Tacoma. The
range has been from the large battleship
Ohio of 12.500 tons gross to the Jones,
Preble and Perry of 400 tons each. The
Chitose, Japanese cruiser, was also built
at the same works in 1898. â¢
In addition to the considerable fleet of
vessels added to the port by building on
the coast there have been important ac
cessions from other yards in the East.
There have also been acquired a great
many large vessels by purchase, which

now are registered here. The list is too
long to be used.
Some mention has already been made of
the drydocks of the port. In course of
construction is the largest of them , all.
This is the property of the California
Drydock Company. It is located at Hunt
ers Point, where there is now in use, by
the same company, a stone graving dock,
493 feet long and 90 feet wide at the en
trance, which is capable of receiving the
largest sailing vessel afloat. The Cali
fornia E>rydock Company also has docks
at Spear street. 301 feet long and 90 feet
wide, capable of taking out 3000 tons.
The new dock at Hunters -Point, now
building, will be 750 feet long from the
gate seat, with a width at' coping of 122
feet, and at bottom of 74 feet, with depth
over sill below coping of 32% feet or 28
feet at high â water. The entrance to the
dock will be closed by a floating caisson,
built of structural steel, which will be a
vessel 104 feet long, with a beam of 28
feet, having a depth from bottom of keel
to underside of upper deck of 33 feet and
9 inches. At the entrance of the dock on
either side are placed wharf approaches,
which are each 60 feet wide and 200 feet
long. The pumping plant will discharge
11.000 gallons per minute. The dock will
take in the largest vessel afloat or that is
projected.
"While the stone dock at Mare Island is
under construction the recommendations
of Colonel Heuer are still before Con
gress for consideration, in which he re
ports upon the cost of the proposed deep
ening- of the channel at the San Pablo
flats to enable battleships of the first class
to reach tlia Mare Island yard. 1

homa and Indian Territory since Thurs
day at midnight has done great damage
to stock in estern Oklahoma, where the
langes are unprotected and cattlemen had
not anticipated the sudden change. The
same Is true in all portions of the two
Territories. The prolonged drought of
the summer Injured all Btock and their
condition was not good enough to with
stand the fierce north wind.
From the Creek and Cherokee nations
of Indian Territory are reports of intense
suffering- among the full-blood Indians
whose crops were ruined by the drought.
Unverified reports from isolated districts
report several deaths among the younger
lull-bloods. The blizzard is proving a
great hardship to the settlers in the new
country, who are living In tents and
shacks.

near Point of Rock Thursday night. Four
bodies have been recovered and are now
being taken to Rock Springs, but the

Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York say:
"The dried fruit situation, both on spot and
on tie coast, developed decided firmness last
â¢week, and at the close prices Tor raisins and
prunes were etrong, with an advancing ten
dency. The change In the raisin market was
the principal feature, the practical securing of
control of the crop on the coast by the seed
ing combine causing excited and higher mar
kets all over the country. At the close 3
crown loose Muscatels on the spot were held
â¢mostly from 5%@5%c, with buyers offering
ajVic Seeded were firm from 7%@7%c for fan-
Coast prices were still withdrawn by prac
tically all packers, but one large outsider was
reported to have named quotations of 6%c for
choice and 7c for fancy, f. o. b., coast. The
seeding combine, or "High Five** telegrams
from California stated that they would name a
price late Saturday, and there was a belief on
the part of some of the best informed local
brokers that the new quotations would be at
about the figures already mentioned, as put out
by an outsider.
"Prunes steadily became firmer during the
week, and at the close it was hard to buy any
Fize Santa Claras, except 50-60s, at 3c basis
on the coast. One large coast packer estimates
the stock of new prunes on the coast at not
over 300 cars, all told. The epot market is
strong, with a fair demand.- Coast advices re
port an advance of %c in apricots and a firmer
leeling in peaches, with Sight supplies of both.
The feeling on both a:-ticles is rather firmer
locally.
"Currants are strong on the spot at 6c, with
a continued active demand for Amalias in bar
rels and cleaned in cartons. Amalias are of
fered at 5vÂ«c. Goods to arrive per Miramax,
<lue about Christmas, are stated to be offering
from 5%@5%c. The Greek market is reported
strong, with advancing tendency, and stocks
becoming light. A cable quoted 15s 6d for
Amalias for prompt shipment per Manln. Figs
sold about %c higher at Friday's auction sale
and the market is etrong and active. Dates
arÂ»> in moderate demand.
"Filberts are scarce and higher from S%@
Sc. .sales being reported Saturday at the latter
figure. Naples walnuts are in very light sup
ply and wanted, holders asking 11 %c firm. Tar
ragona almonds are practically exhausted, Jor
-r:an almonds scarce and firm at 37%@3Sc, and
Brazils very scarce and firm."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14. â Operators in the
ftock market placed a favon.ble interpretation
upon to-day's bank statement and bought stock
L-riskTy after its appearance. As prices ro.-e
over last night's level, heavy soiling to realize
v.as encountered, which carried urlces back
from the best. The offerings diminished at tlio
dfcline and the elosire was firm, at a level
generally above that of last night. Previous
to the bank statement, the market was dull and
lieeltating and governed largely by the erratic
fluctuations in Amalgamated Copj>er. That
etock opened with running Bales of 2C00 shares
at 6JÂ»14 to CO, compared with 66'^ at las*,
nishfs close. It declined to â¬4%. breaking
the low record and checking the advancing
i tendency in other ttocks. The la-st price was
I'JSVi a net l'.erf of a rx>lnt from last night.
The stock went % lower than last Saturday,
compared with a hish price early in the week
more than 10 points over last Saturday's low
prices. The eentlrocnt regarding- the stock
was much confused and brokers usually cred
ited with acting ior insiders both bought ana
: Hold the etock. The decline in cÂ«sh reserve of
the banks Was about a million less than wan
expected. The liquidation in the speculative
markets was reflected in the loan contraction
of $11,178,100. which reduced the encroach
ment on the eurplus to $1,152,650. The trans
fer of funds to New Orleans through the Sub-
Treasury wai continued to-day, and foreign
exchange here hardened, but money was easier
in London. '
The contraction In money supply has been
the dominating influence in the stock market
during the whole of the week, as was clearly
foreshadowed in last Saturday's bank state
ment. With surplus reserves of banks down to
below seven millions and large requirements
for credits incident to the season definitely
known, the problem was one of very simple
arithmetic. Loans placed on call with easily
marketable collateral and especially suc'i as
was used for the speculative holding of stocks
on margin are always the first to be called in
when money requirements are to be met for
other purposes. The action of the money mar
ket has also suggested rather clearly that ssme
of the solid financial powers have acquiesced
in a downward course of srices for the time
as offering: a more substantial vantage ground
from which to face the exigencies of the
annual settlements. In addition there have
been demands to meet which were not counted
: upon. Such has been the foreign demand for
gold, in spite of the decline of exchange rates
to below the point at which gold exports are
profitable as a simple exchange operation. The
gold which has gone out Is believed to have
been purchased at what was in effect a pre
mium by foreign banking institutions which
are desirous to make a favorable showing of
bullion reserves for their annual reports. The
active speculation In grains and cotton haÂ«
also made continuous demands upon New York
for cash, which was not counted upon at this
season cf the year. The smaller expenditures
of the Government, as compared with last
year, have expanded the current surplus and
made larger demands upon the New York
money market through Sub-Treasury opera
tions. The decision of the treasury to pay the
interest in advance is designated as a relief
from the drain, but the payments will not be
made available until next week. The money
market has been active and stringent during
the week and there was a good deal of liqui
dation, but the liquidation of speculative ac
counts forced calling of loans.
Amalgamated Copper, though very erratic
during the week, was very heavily dealt in,
and has .been less of a disturbing element
than last week, its occasional rallies exercis
ing a sustaining influence on stocks at times.
Railrcad bonds have been quite active an>1
irregular. While the outlook is for well sus
tained money rates until the end of the year
and a reoression of speculative buying, the
present condition in trade In all lines keeps
the undertone of speculation confident.
United States old and new fours and the
fives advanced % i>er cent over the closing
call of last week.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â An Inclination to take
profits and Saturday dullness worked against
the cold weather bull factor in grains to-day
and May wheat closed %c down. Wheat had a
dull, steady market, ruling firm early but
eoon losing the gain. Weather conditions had
a good deal to do with the speculative temper
ament and the early cables were something of
a help. Receipts were light and May opened a
shade lower to %Â®'%c up at 80%@80%c, and
quickly sold up to B0%@81c. Trade was not
Important and the early demand from commis
sion houses was about the only feature.? This
soon gave way to profit-taking on the bulgu
and the market gradually sagged off to 79%c
closing weak %c lower at 79%i3>7D%c.
Corn was fairly active and ruled firm the
greater part of the session, i The early de
mand was largely on the part of the shorts,
but the outside markets were also fair buyers.
The cold weather brought the early spurt on the
fear that heavy feeding to stock would be
necessary. Profit taking caused a recession,
May closing steady. %c higher at 67V4@67%c.
Oats were moderately active, but ruled easy
after the early bulge. May closed Weak, Vi@
%o lower at 45%c. ' â¢ . -
Provisions were dull but ruled very firm. The
demand was largely for the local account and
was supplied by packers. May closed lii'/.c
higher and lard and ribs each 7%o higher.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs
Quotations for iverything remained about the
same. Both Butter and Eggs ruled firm, ex
cept . the lower grades of Butter, which were
weak and slow. Stocks of fine Butter were re
ported more or less reduced, while supplies
of Eggs, though moderate, seemed sufficient
for the demand, which was not sharp. The
Cold weather is helping both Butter and Eggs.
There is nothing new in Cheese.
Receipts were 29,400 pounds of Butter,
pounds of Eastern Butter, 400 cases of Eggs,

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
According to the Weather Bureau there
nÂ»^st have been serious damage to Oranges
'iÂ«d Lemons In the southern part' of the State
during the past two or three days, as the
thermometer fell to 22@28 degrees throughout
the Orange belt, and. Oranges as a rule freeze
at 26. The temperature at Riverside fell to
23, and at Los Angeles to 22. Future reports
from that region will be awaited with interest.
Seven cars of Oranges are announced for the
first auction of the season to-morrow. The
market continues well stocked with these
goods. The Honolulu and Portland steamers
took out small shipments. The local demand
Is fair. Small and medium sizes are cleaning
up rapidly, but .there are too many large sizes
on the market.
Two cars of New Orleans Bananas came in.
Receipts of Berries were 14 chests. i-\;rimn

STOCK MARKET.
Business in local stocks and bonds was very
dull, even for Saturday, ana beyond a decline
in California Wine to $87 50 there were no
fluctuations worthy of comment. The oil
stocks were dull.
Oil assessments are announced as follows:
Kern Kins, 5c, delinquent January 23; Silver
Star, lc. delinquent January 7; McKlttrick, lc,
delinquent January 9.
. A local trade Journal says of Monte Cristo
Oil: "The explanation of the recent rally
In the price of this stock on the Oil Exchange
seems to be that the company has a con
tract with thÂ» Standard Oil Company for a
million dollars' worth of oil to be delivered
in live years' time or at the rate of $200,000
per annum. The amount received from this
sale alone, which does not exhaust the pro
duction of the Monte Cristo, would warrant a
dividend of 40c per share per annum. The
company is still developing, however, having
ten new wells under way, and will not . for
some time, perhaps, distribute any money in
the shape of dividends."
An lnterem dividend of 3 per cent is novt
payable by the London, and San Francisco
Bank, Limited.
Sal?s en the Producers' Oil Exchange last
week were 52,500 shares, valued at $19.78U,
the leading sales being as follows: Bear Flag,

A GOOD thing to recollect, is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he is entitled to. We give a:perfect,
sound, and undamaged.. new piano for less
i money than is often - asked . for patched up
and made over Instruments, worked off under
all sorts cf disguises. It Is much better to
get a reliable "new piano that Is known," than
a "bargraln'.'.'-.thaf Is good. only for the time

For the last four days the art gallery
at Mechanics' Pavilion has presented an
animated appearance. This was due to
the bazaar given by the Orthodox Ladles'
Endeavor Society. The bazaar closed a
successful existence last evening. There
was a large attendance and the pur
chases were made with a lavish hand by
the friends of the organization.
Bazaars have been held in this city dur
ing the last month, but none have sur
passed this one in point of color and
richness of articles on exhibition. Price
less -baubles, fabrics and ornaments were
brought from Russia and disposed of by
scores of pretty girls. The booths were
gayly decorated. The ladies In charge
were gowned in costumes that were in
harmony.
The Russian booth was guarded by Mrs.
Elliott, Mrs. Schroeder, Mrs. Metropolsky
and Mrs. Kashevasoff, assisted by Miss
Sasha and Miss Natalie Metropolsky,
Miss Valentine Ligda and Miss Anderson.
Mrs. Fine was in charge of the fortune
telling booth. The Servian booth had as
its patronesses Mrs. L. Dabovich, Mrs.
T. Pashkovsky, Mrs. S. Vucosavlievich
and Miss Dabovich. They were assisted
by the following named pretty young
ladles:
Mrs. Sumnerville, Miss Pauline McNutt,
Miss iriorx^ce Chase, Misses Sophia and Lu
cille Szarnecki, Mies Ima Collins, Miss Irene
Radovlch Miss Nettie Madison, Ml6ses Lydla
and Adele Dabovich and Miss Dollie Madison.
The Hellenic booth was In charge of
Mrs. A. Constantine, assisted by Mrs.
Frank Adams, Mrs. Catherine Martin,
the Misses Tlllle and May I>oyle, Mlsa
Paraskova Sandelin, Miss Stella Miliscich
and Miss Jennie Klaudianos. A very at
tractive feature of the bazaar was the tea
booth, which was In charge of Mrs.
Kashivnikoff, assisted by her daughter.
Miss Lizzie Kashivnikoff and Mrs. Napp.
Tea was served in strictly Russian style.
A novel Russian game was in charge
of Miss Rostozeff and Miss Beckmann.
Miss Popplni and Miss Ellis disposed of
Russian cigarettes and the flower stand
was presided over by Miss Furrer and
Miss A. .Helen, Miss Johannsen was in
charge of the fish pond. Miss V. Beck
mann looked after the grab-bag.
During the progress of the bazaar ex.
cellent musical programmes were .ren
dered by well known artists of this city,
and Russian dinners were served to visi
tors. The success of the bazaar is due to
the energetic work of the officers of the
Orthodox Ladles' Endeavor Society, who
are as follows:
President. Mrs. Elliot; vice president, Mrs.
Kashivanoff; secretary, Mrs. Pashkovsky;
treasurer. Mrs. Melropolsky.
Mrs. F. A. Hatch opened her studio at
131 Post street yesterday and the cozy
rooms were crowded with visitors. Tha

hibited at the late exhibition attracted
a great deal of attention. The artist
possesses talent and she uses her gift for
painting with a skill that will eventually
lead to high recognition in art circles.'

Reynolds Post, and the bride is an active
member of the corps. It was fitting that
the ceremony should be celebrated in a
meeting of the relief corps and in the
presence of post members. The best flag
of the. corps, draped with white ribbon,
was on the altar in the center of the hall,
and upon its silken folds was a silver tea
service, a gift from the corps ,' members.
Thert were also a chair and center table
from the post and a chair from Mr. Ran
dall's associates at the postofllce. Hearty
congratulations followed, and after a
wedding cake of huge dimensions had
been dispensed bythe bride the corps was
called to order. In the absence of tho
president, who was . quite ill, the bride,
who is the senior vice president, pre
sided. The wedding no doubt â¢ made all
present very compliant, as for- the" first
time In the history of the corps every
officer and delegate was elected by ac
clamation. It is the wish of | Wallace
Reynolds Corps that many of the widows
of the order will follow this very patri
otic example. < -'

103, over which District Deputy John T.
Gibson presides, has been fully organized

part of January. Since this deputy has
been in charge the district has been stim
ulated to extraordinary activity, and
from the adjournment of the Grand
Lodge to .the present time there have been
initiated in the district sixty members.
This in a measure is due" to the fact that
the active and energetic deputy has of
fered a set of rosewood sILver-mounted
gravels to the lodge that will show -the
greatest percentage of increase and a
jewel to the individual member who shall
have had initiated the greatest number
of strangers during the current term.

OPEN STANDS GOLDEN GATE INVITING
WORLD'S COMMERCE 10 ITS SHELTER
Destiny Points Way to Where Myriad Travel Lines Converge; and Ships From All
Lands Speed In and Out With Cargoes Representing Every Clime on
Which the Sun Bestows the Guerdon of Fruitful Fields as He Journeys
THIS morning- The Call pays
special attention to the sea
commerce, the shipping and
shipbuilding of the port of
San Francisco and to the
large interests connected there
with. To Its increase the in
dustries of the State of California, the
varied resources of the Pacific Coast, the
Invested capital of all lands, the enter
prise of the world willingly and inevita
bly contributes. Nature carved the
Golden Gate to be the passageway for
the bulk of the trade movement of the
vast Pacific Ocean. Allied Interests on
the Atlantic Ocean and in the interior of
the United States see the hand of destiny
pointing- to San Francisco as the center
to which all lines converge. This Is for
all time the great commercial port of
irfe Pacific Ocean. It fronts a population
sÂ«. vast. In China, the Far East and the
great islands of the Pacific, that the
measure of its future development cannot
be even guessed at.
Facts and figures easily establish tho i
claim that this Is the present leading port
of the Pacific Ocean. Significant facts, so
plain in their Import that they cannot bye
misunderstood by the most casual ob
eerver, point the way that the temporary
advantage that enterprise, coupled -with
natural causes, has conferred upon San
Francisco Is only- a faint indication cf
the lasting: and ever-increasing- domina
tion the Golden Gate must exercise in'
the trend of world's business and affairs.
An abundance cf figures, carefully "com
piled, are submitted herewith. At r the
same time conditions of many kinds are
regarded dispassionately for the sake of
the groat lesson they teach.
When tribute is jiaid to the greatness
cf Ban Francisco, and to her glittering
future, the claims of those wise and en-
Vtrprislng men who have built up . her
JRmmerce; built, owned, managed " and
sailed her ships; provided the many
facilities needed for the malnte-

nance of great fleet* that go by

prehensive plan for the proper use of the
great harbor that offers its protection to
the carriers of commerce from all lands;
who havÂ»> added their might and means
to improve in any way the heritage
which nature gave â deserve to be " re
membered. ' San Francisco's real 'â  great
name is derived from its geographical
position. It is a great seaportâ certain
to be one of the greatest,. If not. greater
than any other in , the entire world.
Those connected with the shipping in
terests have the task of development in

their respective duties, and the future, as
well as the present, holds honors for

Co-operative Agencies.
Connected immediately in the home field
with the ' development ' of the sea com
merce or San Francisco are the. many
industries of California. They supply from
the fields; the orchards, the vineyards,
the manufactories and the warehouses a
vast bulk of freight that lures : the ship
ping of the world here. The , agricultu
rist, the fruit grower, the producer of
wines and brandies, the miner, the
merchant, the manufacturer, the artisan,
are all tributary In tfie promotion of the
interests of the State upon the sea In the
matter of sea carriage. Some of these are
represented by organizations which take
care of their affairs In many particulars.
An expression of, opinion has' been ' sought
and obtained from representative men oc
cupying official ', positions in. these organ
izations concerning- San Francisco's com
merce and the means to best promote the
same. It will be seen that the auxiliary
agencies at work for that, desirable end
are valuable. The tone of the several ut
terances Is hopeful and buoyant.'
The first and significant fact 'about the
future of this port is that It has facilities
naturally and room to provide all acces
sories, together, with the financial means,
whenever expansion; of wharves, etc., is

necessary. â  The second is that the men of
affairs and money in the East having their
eyes upon the trade situation of the world
are making their preparations In full sight
of the world to use the Golden Gate as
much as possible for the moving of the
business of the United "States;" and pf
Europe to and from the Orient via San
Francisco. The transcontinental lines
are ! lowering their grades,' shortening
their tracks', "and making their through
rates to the Orient upon such basis that
their evident faith in their ability to use
this route as against all competition vja
Suez or otherwise is manifest. Not the
least of the factors is the great extent
and capacity of California to support a
population of many millions. Coupled
with this consideration are the attractions
of climate; the Inexhaustible supply of
cheap oil for fuel; the vast water power,
convertible into electricity, that will . be
available as Jong as mountain streams
run down the sides of the Sierra to 1111.
storage reservoirs and to turn wheels of
industry.
A Great Harbor. . . .
The harbor of San Francisco is of great
extent. The area of the Bay of San Fran
cisco, exclusive of the basins known as
San "Pablo' and Suisun bay's." reckoned*. to
the line of high water, is 257 square miles,
geventy-nlne square miles are within the
three-fathom contour line and navigable
for large sea -going vessels. The anchor
age basin proper within the boundaries of
the city and . county â¢ of San Francisco
and immediately adjacent thereto, em
braces an area of fifty-nine square miles.'
Notwithstanding its, great s extent, ' ship's
riding at anchor are seldom damaged by
the most violent gales that 'rage' In the
winter months. (
. The entrance to the harbor . between
Fort Point and' L-ime Point is nine-tenths
of a infle wide. The depth of the bar is
33 feet at low water. .Compared with San
Francisco Bay â¢ the harbor of New York
seems insignificant. New York - Bay, > at
high tide, , covers an area of twenty-two
square miles,; of which but nine â¢ and a
half .square miles are within the three
fathom line. Add to this the' deep water
in the North and East rivers and- the to
tal available area is only twenty-one and
a half square miles. The entrance to the
Narrows is- three-fourths . of a mile in
width, but the depth of the water on the
bar does not exceed 22 feet at low water.
: In a pamphlet recently sent out by the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce the
channel depth and also the averag'e max
imum depth of water at; wharves at the
leading commercial ports of the "world
were stated; : In this general connection
it may be Interesting to know that, the
channel depths of, various American ports
are set forth as follows In the pamphlet
alluded to: San Francisco, 39:2 feet; New
Orleans, 26;, Baltimore, 31:5; Boston. 36:C;
Newport' News, '28:7; New .York, 34:6;
Portland,' Or.',; 24: San Diego, 27:4; New
Haven, 23; Charleston, S. C, 25.
'. 4 The channel depth at important foreign
ports is as follows: Yokohama, 30 feet;
Victoria, B. C., 38; Amsterdam, 30; Auck
land, 43; Rio; de . Janeiro, 34; Odessa, 20;
Sydney, 1 N. S. W.. 1 34:5; Shanghai, 24; Ha

â¢ The average, depth , at wharf : at high
water Is found, to 'be for 106 ports 29.92

ot â¢ 39:2 feet. It may. be not , necessary to
follow, iip , these figures â¢ further. : Enough
has been ; given to ;' show . the superiority
of San .Francisco's harbor in. the essen

THE San Francisco wharves are
distant from one another from 173
to 200 feet. This supplies a con
siderable bulkhead space, that is
available for email tail and steam
< raft. Deep water in the berth spaces i*
maintained by the continuous use of the
State dredgers. The increase of business
has compelled the Board of Harbor Com
missioners to enlarge certain wharves.
The freight space at the Jackson-street
wharf has been increased by the beard
from 24.0CO square feet to 42,000 siuare
feet. A new wharf has been built at
Howard No. 2. 430 feet Iong. 103 feet wido
and accommodating l'.OfiO tons of freight.
To accommodate the United States
transport service the board has length
ened the Steuart-street wharf ty 760 fet-t.
adding- 20i> feet. Accommodations have
lieen iurnished to the Santa Fe Railroad
Company to enter the city. by ferry. Four
new wharves have been constructed for
the fishermen at the foot of Taylor street.
The- Main-street wharf has been length
ened 220 feet, making it SOJ feet long, in
stead of 570 feet. The wharfage facilities
at Jackson and Howard streets have b^cn
largely addet^ to. There are other addi
tions of importance, which it would tak-Â»
too much space to mention.
The" great act of importance by the
board was securing tho extension of tho
pierhead line between Folsom street an<i
Van Ness avenue. The legal length for
wharves in that large area is now h00 feet.
Pierhead Line.
Tho extension of the pierhead line and
tho increase in the wharfage accommoda
tions of the port wer % * advocated by the
entire commercial community of San
Frr.ncisco. In a communication addressed
to Governor Gape the Harbor Commis
sioners locognixed this when they set
forth the following:
"Should the business of this port In
cronjie to puch an extent as Is now jjener
nlly conceded that It will legislation will
be necessary Jo enable this commission to
accommodate the modern-built vessels
with wharf facilities. The present outline
of the San Francisco water front was ar
ranged years ago, when* the greatest
length of ihe vessels entering the port
was from 200 to 300 feet. At the time
when these conditions existed the Legis
lature prohibited the Harbor Commission
ers from extending wharves out moro
than 600 feet from the bulkhead line, in
asmuch as the vessels then arriving four
of them, two on each side, could be
moored alongside of a wharf 500 or 600 feet
in length.
"Vessels now afloat and being built In
the shipyards of the world \-ary from 400
to TOO feet in length. Such vessels have
been coming to this port and their num
ber will henceforth increase. Therefore
it can be seen that our dockage room at
wharves. 600 feet and less, has become
minimized. The law should be amended
to permit the extension of wharves out
â¢a distance of 800 feet from the bulkhead
instead of 600 feet, as provided by the
present law."
This communication was signed by all
the Commissioners. Paris Kilburn. P. J.-
Hamey and Rudolph Herold Jr.. and also
by ex-Governor Budd, Howard C. Holmes
and William D. English, all being con
nected with the board. The Legislature
gave the relief that was asked for and
a new era in wharf building was begun.
Terminal Facilities.
V In recounting the advantages on the wa
ter front of San Francisco for the encour
agement of commerce, the belt railway
should not be lost Bight of. "This is oÂ«e
of the most Important departments under
the new administration of the Harbor
Commission. The road extends from
Powell street to Broadnay. The seawall
on the north end of the water front and
lots acquired by the State in the con
struction of the seawall axe used for yard
room, sidings and freight depots. Prior to
the construction and operation of the belt
railway the several railroad companies,
excepting the Southern Pacific Company,
had no freight terminals in San Fran
cisco.
The freight car terminal of the North
Pacific Coast road was at Sausallto; that
of the San Francisco and North Pacific
rdad (now the California Northwestern)
was at Tiburon. while that of the South
Pacific Coast Railroad was in Alameda.

from this city was transported by steam
ers and barges 10 the paints named and
there leaded on cars for points of destina
tion in (lie interior of th,e State.
Under these circumstances the move
ment of. commerce was' impeded. The ex
tra handling of freight occasioned by this
mode of handling was expensive. The belt
railway furnished a remedy. Each of the
companies previously mentioned has a
freight depot and yard- room on the line
of the road, at which freights â¢ are re
ceived and dispatched. These accommo
dations are n<?ar to the wholesale center
of the city und the drayage haul is con

Solid Seawall.
The preceding general description of the
means publicly provided for the promo
tion of commerce en the water front of
San Franciscc. hut not Including, those
supplied by private enterprise, may be
completed by pi^. account of the seawall
and the ferry depot.
The seawall extends- along the water
front from the foot of Taylor street in a
southeasterly and southerly direction to a
point 208 feet south of the ferry .depot,
terminatinp for the time at Mission street.
The seav.-all is a desirable thoroughfare
for the immense traffic carried on upon
the water front property. On the south
ond of tho city front the traffic has to be
teamrd over wooden bulkheads. Eventu
ally the seawall will be extended to Chan
nel street, and this, in point of fact, is
recommended by the H:irbor Commission
ers for performance after the necessary
extensions of wharves has been complet
ed. 15y extending to Channel street the
State will come into possession of twenty
four ftfty-vara lots. In addition thereto

The ferry depot Â«Â« fi39 feet lonjr and Its
peneral width Is 159 feet. From the cen
tral portion on Market street a bay pro
jects Â£8 feet and 144 foot wide. There were
used in the construction about 5,000,000
pounds of steel and cast-iron, 2000 cubic
reet of granite, 30,000 square feet of mar
ble, 53,000 cubic feet of sandstone, 1,450.000
common brick, 125,750 square feet of ex
panded metal and concrete floor arches
40,000 square feet of mosaic flooring and
C75.O00 pounds of galvanized iron, includ
ing roofing. The ferry building covers
107,000 square feet of surface, or more
than ten times that of an ordinary com
mercial building.
The structure was authorized by the
voters of the State, who thereby â  ex
pressed their desire to aid in the increase
of the commercial importance of this city.
The Legislature of California passed an"
act, which was approved by the Governor
March 17, 1891, to create a fund for the
construction and furnishing by the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners of a gen
eral ferry and passenger depot, and to
provide a. sinking fund for the payment
of bonds to be issued to defray the cost
of the large work to be undertaken. Un

THERE IS HISTORY
FOR EVERY MOORING
Strange Stories Told of Happenings in
Which the Present Has a
Piquant interest.
ym. V O originality can be. claimed for
Ftbwl the plan of public development of
I the water front of San Francisco.
JL Other large ports have belt rail
ways, ferry depots and union pas
senger stations, seawalls and ample
wharfage accommodations for all tne
ships that may come to seek their use.
But it will be always recollected that
the commerce of the port is responsible
for the creation of solid land from Mont
gomery street to tb.e present seaward UEtj
of the water front.
First there were iong wharves Pâ¢>jec.
ing from the old shore line out into tne
bay. Then there were cross lines or
bridges that denoted the outlines ol tnt
streets actually.- to be constructed ar.u
which have since become the .avenues
through which the wholesale business cu
San Francisco has been moving to an<_
from ships and cars for many years.
When the network of wharves and
bridges was in existence the tilling in or
lands proceeded. ;
Heaven gave San Francisco sand in
more than one sense and enough to carry
her through many difficulties. There was
enough of the movable material to nil in
to the present water front. A glance into
history gives an idea of the contour op
the bay side of earlier San Francisco and.
incidentally, furnishes a measure by
which to estimate the local opinion -that
the people, if they did not have business
area adequate to their needs, were certain
to create it for themselves with the facil
ities placed by nature within their reach.
The following general facts of interest
are gleaned from Hindi's history, relat
ing to the period of 1S50. According to
KitteH's "account the first city charter,
passed by the Legislature .on- April lo.
1850, had fixed the southerly boundary of
San Francisco by a line parallel to Clay
street, two miles south of the center of
Portsmouth Square, and its western
boundary by a line parallel to Kearny
street a mile and xi half west of the
same center, having its northern and east
ern boundaries commensurate with those
of the county. The -area of land above
high water mark included within these
limits was nearly five square miles. But
there was a very- little. If any, that was
fit for building sites without some change,
either of excavation or filling up, and
hardly a spot, when it was to be covered
with buildings, retained its old surface.
The Original Limits.
Fortunately moat of the uneven surface
consisted of Band, which wasTnoved with
comparative ease, and the work of grau
lnsr proceeded as rapidly as even space
was required. While the hills and ridges
of sand In the city, many of them upward
of fifty feet high, were betnR lowered and
the material was used to elevate hollows
and also to (111 in mudflats, Rreat quan
tities of piles were belns brought into the.
cltv from far and near to build wharves
and to extend the city front Into the bay.
In the course of 1S49 the Broadway
wharf. 250 feet in length, had been con
structed, and by the end of the same year
another wharf had been run out on the
line of Commercial street, from Mont
gomery stree,t eastward about 800 feet.
The last mentioned structure was con
sumed partly .by fire in June. 1850. but it
was almost immediately afterward re
paired, and by degrees .was extended a
distance of 2000 feet into the bay. It con
stituted then and for years was known as
Long Wharf. -
Other wharves were then also begun
and gradually run out into the bay.
Among these was the Market-street
wharf, which by October, 1S50, extended
COO feet; California-street wharf, 400 feet;
Sacramento-street wharf-, â  800 feet; Clay
street wharf, 900 feet; "Washington-street
wharf, 275 feet; Jackson-street . wharf, 550
feet, and Pacific-street wharf, 525 feet.
Builders Spend Â§1,000,000.
-Besides these wharves, which were gen
erally owned by private companies, there
were several piers owned by private in
dividuals, such asHowison's pier, between
California and Sacramento streets, and
Cunningham's wharf and .Lewis' wharf,
near the foot of Green street. â  Altogether
there was more than 600Â© -feet of wharf
age, which cost more than $1,000,000. The
wharves named after the streets were the
extensions of such streets. As they moved
forward the piling and capping of the lots
between them followed.
So by degrees as the city advanced all
its lower portion, Including I the greater
Stockton St, and North Point.
/
portion of its business quarter, was built
on piles. Between the long rows of these
piles, and under the houses as well a* the

the time.
West -of where the Bank of California
now stands the first water lot to be filled
in engaged the enterprise of Captain Jo
seph L. Folscm. The work was very ex
pensive, but the value of the property ap
preciated so rapidly that the cost was
found to have beer, a goood investment,
and other citizens followed the txamp's
of Captain Folsom.
Meanwhile, as the wharves extended
into the bay, the cress streets wer? built
on piles, much like an Occidental Venice,
thus inclosing blocks of wj'ter between
them, and a number of old hulks or dis
mantled vessels that had been drawn up
on the mudflats at high tide and convert
ed into business places were shut in.
There were about twenty of the old hulk3
that were so utilized.
Romance of Hulk's.
One of these was the brig Euphemla.
purchased by the ayuntamlento in Aug
ust. 1349. for a prison. It was anchored
near the corner of Jackson and Battery
streets and continued in use as a prison
tor several years.
Another of these vessels was the ship
Apollo, which was anchored near tha
corner of the same streets. It J\a<t been
used as a store ship, but when uSUtery
street, being piled and capped, closed It
in, it was converted into a lodKlnjj-hcyyso
and drinking shop, and was called tfco
Apollo saloon. As a considerable porting
of the hulk rose above tho level Â«.. th*
streets when they cam<- to be filled in.e
the vessel, located in the middle of Urn
business portion of San Francisco, sur
rounded on all sides by blocks of sub
stantial edifices; presented an object for
curiosity and astonishment.
Tho hull of the ship Thomas Bennett,
on the south side of Howlson's pier, near
the corner of Sacramento and Sansomo
streets, served as the headquarters for
the young blades from Baltimore until
the building of the Monumental engine
house.
Perhaps the most notable of thes*J
vessels which were destined to en<p
their- existence on solid land was thÂ«
ship Niantlc. It was of 450 tons
burden. It had been hauled up on a lot
on the northwest corner of Clay and San
some streets. After the masts and rig
ging and some of the ballast had been re
moved piles were driven on each side to
steady the hull, which was then used for
storing merchandise. Meanwhile tha
land was filled in all about It and tho
city moved on eastward beyond it. The
fire of May, 1S31, destroyed all of the
old ship Niantlc excepting such portions
as were under ground.
Found in a Basement
Soon after the fire of 1851 a hotel, known
as the Niantic House, was erected on
the remains of the old hulk, â which served
as a foundation. ' â¢ That was a popular
house for some years, but it was finally
succeeded by more pretentious places.
In 1872 the Niantic House waa. torn down,
'and the lot was excavated for the large
brick structure which now' stands on the
site. .
In digging the workmen found the bot
tom of the old hulk filled with dirt and
covering various articles of merchandise,
including several cases of "Jacqueason
Fils" champagne, which had been buried
there for upward of twenty-one*, years.
The Dottles were in good order, but the
wine had seen better days. It had doub*
less been deposited there before 1S51. and
the dirt washed in at the time cf the fire
or In the filling in of- the lot. No one
thought of or inquired for the merchan
dise in the meantime.
From Hittell the facts are also derived >
concerning the subsequent history of the I
water front. The filling in of the mu&J
flats continued and progressed rapidly.
General Kearny, by a decree of March
10. 1847. purported to release to the city
of San Francisco all the right, title and
interest of the Government to the water
, front, excepting such lots as might be
reserved, provided that the property
should be divided into lots and sold at
> public auction.PREPARING TO GARNER GOLDEN HARVEST

THE story of the creation of fatu
ities for the present splendid
harbor of San Francisco Is in
teresting. Under the Kearny de
cree many lots were sold, but a
decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States put the titles of the pur
chasers In question. It became necessary
to procure the title from the State of Cal
ifornia, which was a Territory when Gen
eral Kearny issued his decree. When the
State Legislature in 1S51 came to deal with
the property of San Francisco, including
i he beach and water lots, the use was
granted to the city of San Francisco for
ninety-nine years, except the lots that
had been sold under Kearny's authority.
All the excepted lots were granted to the
hciders of title for ninety-nine years. It
af > provided that alcalde grants or, in
case of loss, properly certified copies
thereof, should be considered as prima
facie evidence.
Sea Line Established.
By the same beach and water lot law
a permanent water front of San Francisco
was established and maps were ordered
to bo prepared and deposited In public
offices upon which the boundary was
delineated by a red lire.
While the water line remained fixed tn<
Legislature reserved the right to regulat

the construction of wharves or other Im
provements, so that they should not in
terfere with the shipping and commercial
interests of the bay and harbor.
Another law was passed, at the same
session, of the Legislature, empowering
the city of San Francisco to construct
wharves at the ends of all streets con
necting with the bay by extending such
streets, not exceeding 600 feet beyond the
water front or red line that indicated the
front on the official maps. The recent
legislation by which the wharves can be
extended 800 feet from the bulkhead has
been previously mentioned.
From the early consideration of the San
Francisco water front by the Legislature
came about a number of conveyances
that caused much excitement, these be
ing known as the Co'.ton grants.
One of San Francisco's Justices of the
Peace was G. Q. Colton, who assumed
the right, which had been exercised under
the Mexican Government by Justices of
the Peace, of selling lands. He made
grants to whoever would accept them at
the rate of $100 for lots that were worth
much more. Colton went away in a fort
night after this performance and took the
money that he had received for the lots
with him. Proceedings in behalf of the
city were authorized against Colton and
the grants that he had issued were de
clared by the proper authority to be null
and -void.
Large Money Involved.
The property that the Colton grants
covered embraced fifty-three water lots
within the Kearny grant, which were then
estimated to be worth at least $200,000.
The Common Council of San Francisco
passed an ordinance adopting: the condi
tions of an act of the Legislature to
validate the Colton grants, but Mayor
Stephen R. Harris vetoed the ordinance.
In 1853 the Legislature repealed the stat
ute and that ended a great controversy to
titles on the water front.
When the grades of Montgomery and
other streets next to the waters of the
bay were originally fixed, the fact was
seemingly overlooked that the mud flats
would have to be filled in. The street
grades were only a few feet above high
water mark, but were high enough for
the water front as it then existed. When
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15, 19011

ANOTHER P0NORAM0. TAPING NORTHERN ASPECT FROM FERRY OUTLOOK-
the bay line was fixed by statute 1000 feet
east of the old shore it was found neces
sary to raise the grade.
Over S00 buildings, many of them being
of brick, had to be raised to meet the
higher grade of the streets that was
needed. There were also deep cuttings in
the hills that were necessitated by the en
larged water front. Some of these cut
tings were from ISO to 200 feet deep. So it
appears that the water front, throughout,
exercised materially as important a func
tion in shaping the contour of the city
as it since has commercially, in increas
ing its importance among the maritime
ports of the world.
Over the wharves passed out very large
exports in the first few years of the city
of San Francisco. The State Register
supplies some figures in this connection
that are of interest. In 1848 goods were
imported to the amount of $1,000,000 and
the coin import -was about the same.
$1,000,000. In the same year the export of
gold dust amounted to about $2,000,000. In
1849 San Francisco shipped $5,000,000 In
treasure; in 1S50 upward of $27,000,000; In
1S51 more than $51,000,000: in 1852 In excess
of $46,000,000: in 1853, which was the year
of largest production in the early days,
the treasure shipped from San Francisco
amounted to more than $57,000,000, or more
than $1,000,000 per week.
There were other legal troubles over
the water front which have not been men
tioned. In 1S53 the State was financially
embarrassed and Governor Bigler pro
posed to extend the water front of San
Francisco 600 feet farther into the bay
than the previously fixed limit, hoping
to raise a large amount of money by sell
ing the lots for the benefit of the State
treasury. "As a matter of fact," says
Hittell's history, "all this property, 600
feet beyond the red line, had been includ
ed in the Peter Smith swindle and on
January 2, 1S62, had been knocked down
under the hammer. As the city clearly
had no proprietary interest beyond the
red line, it was plain that the sale was
void."
GREAT HARBOR THAT
IS WITHOUT A PEER
Broad and Splendid Haven to Mold All
Earth's Navies, Which Here
Could Be Secure.
A BILL waa introduced by a mem
ber of the Assembly from Tuol
umne County for the proposed ex
tension of the water front line
and also for the sale of the lots
and the disposition of the proceeds from
the sale.
Under this bill the State would get one
third of the money and the purchasers at
the Peter Smith sale and their grantees
two-thirds. As the property was esti
mated to be worth fully $6,000,000 the large
amount of $4,000,000 was to go Into private
pockets. The bill was passed by the As
sembly, and on the disapproval of the act
all but two of the San Francisco members
of the Assembly resigned their seats. The
other two voted for the extension bill.
When the measure came into the Senate
for final passage the Senators voted 13
to 13.
"All eyes," says Hittell, "were now
turned upon Samuel Purdy.the Lieutenant
Governor, who was president of the Sen
ate and had the casting vote. He unhesi
tatingly voted against the bill and there
by killed it. His vote made him famous
and also made him for the time the most
popular man in California, while it saved
the City from great loss and the State
from disgrace." â -.
In 1853 there were sold 120 lots at auc
tion that had been included originally in
the city slip property, being in four blocks
along Commercial-street wharf and ex
tending from Sacramento to Clay street,
reserved by the city for a free public dock
for shipping. The average price obtained
for these lots was $10,000 each. The exten
sion of the city had shown that' they
would not be available for the use that
had at first been designed for them.
The proceeds of the sale were, in gross,
$1,193,550. But there was a flaw in the or
dinance by which the city had proceeded,
and the sale was thereby voided. In 1S53
there were sold fifty-one lots between Pa
cific street and Broadway, east from
Sansome street, that the State might raise
money, and these lots were knocked down
at auction for an average of $6S94 per
flfty-vara. This was the first sale under
the beach and water lots act. â 
After many vicissitudes, some of the
more important of which have been des
cribed, the water front of San Francisco
may be said to have entered upon Its sec
ond period. This began when the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners was cre
ated by the Legislature. Since then the
water-front affairs have been adminis
tered by the board, and the systematic
improvements, the construction of the
seawall and other works, have taken
place under the board's general direc
tion. The greatest single event in which
official action has figured In making wa
ter front history in the past few years
was undoubtedly the granting of a lease
of China Basin, by which a competi
tor to the Southern Pacific Company in
the carrying trade overland was ad
mitted directly to the city.
China Basin Lease.
The leasing of China Basin to the
San Joaquin Valley Railroad came at a
time when competition knocked for the
first time at the door. When the build
ing of the Valley road was the principal
topic of discussion in commercial circles
in this city the projectors of that road
decided that without a terminal In this
city the venture was not safe.
In March, 1S95. a -bill was introduced in
the State Legislature to provide for the
lease. The bill passed both houses by a
large majority.
In May the document was signed. That
secured the construction of the competing
road. At this time operations are going
on upon a large scale at the basin, the
work of grading and preparing the lands
for the terminal of the Santa Fe Rail
road, into which company the San Joa
quin Valley road was subsequently
merged, being In progress.

THE shipping of San Francisco has
been so vast in the nearly half
century of the use of the Golden
Gate by Americans that noth-
ing like a complete history of it
can be attempted in the space allowed,
but there are many interesting: facts that
can be mentioned. The minds of mari
ners naturally turn back to the glory of
the days of the clipper ships that played
so prominent a part in the early annals of
this State. . .
They were sailing vessels measuring 1000
tons or more, with sharp bows, sides mod
eled for speed, tall masts and capacity to
carry a great spread of canvas. /Their
first ' appearance in the bay of San
Francisco was In the latter part of 1850,
in answer to the demand tor quick trans
portation of large quantities of freight to
San Francisco. They were superior to
anjj sailing ships then afloat in elegance
and marine architecture.

tory of San Francisco are narratives cal
culated to make the nautlcally inclined
smile. For instance there was the case
of the Dutch bark Alexander von Hum
boldt, that was chartered at Panama in
1849 to carry coal.
. There were so many persons waiting at
the I isthmus . to be I carried to â¢ California
that the- owners decided - to ;', turn Â» their
Humboldt into a. passenger' vessel for the
time. The sale of tickets ; at the-.'rate. of.
$300 each.' went -on â¢'-with great speed, and
before the sailing time it was discovered
that there were nearly 100. more passen
gers booked than could be safely carried.'
The owners had already received $60,000
for passage money when the discovery
was made that the ship had been over-
MUSEUM LENDS ITS ASSISTANCE
THE efforts of the merchants of San Francisco to establish in this city a commercial museum
as a medium through which a wider knowledge of the commerce and products of the coun
tries bordering on the Pacific Ocean may be obtained are about to be realized.
An office zvas opened last spring in the ferry building and quite a large space for the exhibit
of products set aside for the use of the inuscum through the public spirit of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners. Since then active measures have been taken to collect the materials for a bureau
of information, to be supplemented by an exhibit not only of the razv products of Pacific Ocean
countries but also of the articles of foreign manufacture now sold in those countries, with zvhich
Exhibits from the Buffalo Exposition have arrived and are being installed in the museum; a
large consignment of exhibits covering most of the Pacific Ocean countries is promised next
month; an agent of the museum in the Philippines has been at work for several months collecting
exhibits in the islands, this "work being under the charge of a special committee consisting of
Messrs. Barry Baldzvin and Oscar Sutro, formerly of this city, and Mr. John McLeod, president
of the Compania Maritima of Manila. . " EUGENE .GOODWIN,

sold. Then the passengers called a meet
ing and forbade the captain to hoist an
chor. The owners were i seized by the
passengers and made prisoners upon the
Humboldt until on their knees they had
agreed to charter a brig that was lying
in the harbor to carry the excess of those
who had paid their fare and could not be
safely accommodated upon the Humboldt.
Eighty-four were then
transferred to the brig, but it was dis
covered that the provisions were both
bad and scanty in supply and another de
mand was made upon the owners, which
was that "they should get enough pro
visions and of good quality.
-When the owners refused to do this the
passengers bought the provisions and
gave notice that they had a lien upon
the Humboldt. The case of < the Brit
ish bark John Ritson, which sailed
from Panama for San Francisco in the
early days with about seventy passen
gers, was somewhat similar.
The captain of the Ritson had received
his money from the passengers at the
rate of $200 for the cabin and $150 for' the
steerage. .When the ship went to sea the
passengers found out directly that the
food supply was small and" that the food
was not good to eat. The steerage â  pas
sengers refused to accept wormy biscuit:
The captain listened to them with a smile.
The passengers got possession : of a~. bar
rel of good provisions and helped them
selves. '\ --â 
Master Is Wrathy.
> Then the; .master, became furious and
threatened to -.throw overboard, any per
son who again- helped himself to ship's
stores. This did not produce the effect
that the captain On the con
trary, his refractory passengers threat
ened to put him' overboard if he did not
see to it that their .bill of fare was mend-
ed. Then there was a stormy scene.
The captain threatened to return to
Panama and also to run his ship ashore.
The passengers told him that he could
do as he thought best about that, but
they would have good food while they
were on his vessel or he would suffer for
the lack. â -â¢â¢..
The captain still stormed, but" about
that time a New Bedford bark passed
the Ritson at sea and gave the informa
tion that the passengers had placed her
captain and officers in confinement and
had taken charge of the vessel. A Brit
ish man-of-war went after the Americans
who had thus taken the law into their
own hands upon the high seas. The ex
ample was not lost upon the master or
the Ritson and his passengers saw a
marked betterment from that day.
Of the 1 immigrants to California who
came by sea. a very large proportion were
from the Atlantic coast of the .United
States and were familiar with the man
agement of ships, many of them being
skilled navigators. They were able to
handle the ships, and their controversies
with the masters of the vessels In the
case of any injustice directed against the
passengers was not one-sided.
Before the completion of the- Central
and Union Pacific railroads the shipping
Industry of the'port of San Francisco was
free to be developed fully. After a time
the policy of the railroad companies, who
determined to control and monopolize as
much- as possible the carrying trade be
tween the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
the United States, embraced a systematic
Interference with shipping enterprise and
brought about a radical â  change in con
ditions and eventually led, to a new era,
the storyof which is necessarily long.. In
that was involved the determined struggle
with the transcontinental, railways and
their allied sea lines, whose Iron clutch
was on the throat of this port.

AT one time the clipper ship was
the symbol of touch -with the
outer world. The .clippers were
flyers truly. Time was precious
and the charges of the clipper
owners were based upon the necessities
of the people who had to use their
vessels perforce. For several years
the rate on certain sorts of freight from
New York to San Francisco by clipper

ship was $50 per ton, which was about
four times the ruling rate prior to the
clipper advent. In return the clippers
clapped on all the sail they could carry
and went along with "a white bone in
their teeth" as fast as the blasts of old
ocean would carry them.
Very Fast Sailing.
It was not uncommon for a clipper to

make a trip from New York to San Fran
cisco in less than three months. They
beat the older ships fully one-third in
time. With a good breeze they would
leave ocean steamers behind.
"Sailors," says Hittel, "saw them at
first with amazement, and have not yet
lost their admiration for the clippers."
Often a California clipper earned nearly
enough en its first voyage 'to pay for its
cost. On several occasions the owners
found that the freights from cargoes
shipped amounted to twice the cost of
building the ship.
The names of the early clippers were
suggestive of the romance of the sea,
among them being the White Squall,
Flying Cloud. Trade Wind and Sovereign
of the Seas. The expenses of lying at a
San Francisco wharf was then about
$100 per day, which made discharging ex
pensive. It was, correspondingly expo-

ditious, the stevedores coming on for an
inducement from the owners to "make
speed," which they surely did.
In a period of nine months in 1849 there
were 549 vessels to pass in through the
Golden Gate to the bay of San Francisco.
Of these 223 came in from Atlantic coast
ports of the United States and 31G were
from other ports. There were two ar
rivals per day on the average.
This considerable fleet of vessels
brought to San Francisco 35,000 persons
In the time indicated, of whom 23,000 were
Americans. Three thousand sailors de
serted their ships in a short time and in
the beginning of August, 1849, there
were 200 square-rigged vessels lying in
the bay without crews and unable to get
away. That same year 42,000 immigrants
came into the State overland, and the
end of the year gavq California a right
to claim 100,000 population. Many of the
vessels that brought in immigrants from
tho East were "old. tubs" that were un
safe to sail upon. Somehow almost all
of them arrived safely in port. when
there was such' pressure to reach San
Francisco everything went.
The first steamer to enter the Golden
Gate was the Pacific Mail liner, the Cali
fornia, which with two sister ships was
built for the California trade, to run be
tween the isthmus of Panama and Ore
gon, stopping at San Francisco, by the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
The corporation named came into ex
istence in the beginning of the gold ex
citement. The entrance of the Califor
nia to the bay is well described by Hit
tell.
She arrived on the forenoon of Febru
ary 28, 1849. The people went to the top
of Telegraph Hill and to Clarks Point,
the latter being the place where all
freight was then landed. The California,
black with wondering passengers, came
around Clarks Point, arid two American
men-of-war that were lying at anchor
greeted her with cannon, the playing of
a band and the manning of yards, while
the crews cheered loudly. The cheering
was repeated on the shore and answered
from the deck and rigging of the
steamer.
That night the people celebrated the ar
rival of the first steamer in the charac-
teristlc manner of the time. The build
ings were illuminated; fireworks were dis
charged; pistols were fired; champagne
was drunk in "volleys," the jovial Cali
fornians "firing and falling back" in
squads.
The first steamboat to run regularly be
tween San Francisco and Sacramento was
the ocean steamer McKlm, which arrived
at San Francisco October 3, 1849.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1901.
OVERLAND CARRIERS PLOTTING
AGAINST WATER COMPETITION
Allied Transportation Lines Make the Strongest Effort
Possible to Secure to Themselves Monopoly
Adopting Harsh Measures.
ON the 10th day of May, 1869,' the
last spike was driven that bound
together the Central Pacific and
Union Pacific railroads In a trans
continental line. The spike was
of solid gold..^jtjie!d the last rail down
to an elaborately prepared tie of Califor
nia laurel, In the center of which was a
silver plate bearing the names of the two
railroad companies and . of their officers.
The spike camo from California and was
of native metal, emblematic of the vast
supplies of coin which the railroads were
to take from the State by the Golden Gate
in tbe comlne years
There was much rejoicing over the join
ing of the ends of the first American
transcontinental line. Soon after that
business actually began and freight and
passengers moved overland and traffic so
carried was diverted from the sea.
Scheme of Oppression.
In course of time the Central Pacific
management devised a scheme to take
away from San Francisco all use of the
sea as much as possible for the moving
of freights between the Atlantic and Pa
cific coasts. . There then- became known a
"special contract," under which shippers
who would refuse to ship any freight by
sea and pledged themselves to give all
their freighting business to the railroad
had, in return, preferential rates. In a
sense the railroad became their partners.
Those who did not get the better rates
had to retire from business in some in-
stances, being undersold" by -their more
favored competitors. The whole effect of
this was to set back all the shipping in
terests of the port of San Francisco. The
clippers became largely past history. They
sailed off into disuse.
In time other .railroads were buiit
across the continent. Tbe builders of the
Central Pacific Company constructed,
also, the Southern Pacific Railroad lines,
and the Central and Southern Pacific
lines came under one management and
had the exclusive carrying trade of Cal
ifornia by rail. There was no other trans
continental road in prospect for this
State. Merchants were at the mercy of
the carriers. After the other transconti
nental roads were running to the north of
California the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company came, by accepting a subsidy,
under the control of the roads, which join
ed in the formation of what was known
as the Transcontinental Association. With
little delay this huge combination of car
riers devised a plan, which proved to be
effective, by which the sea .commerce of
the port was further crippled.
A Huge Subsidy.
This was to pay the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, under the guise of hiring
space, a subsidy of $75,000 per month, to
permit the transcontinental roads to
control the rates 'on freight carried in
both directions in the company's steam
ers. The control of , the rates paid for
carrying freights around Cape Horn in
both directions also was secured by the
transcontinental carriers. In a word San
Francisco was bottled.
Things went along this way for some
time with the grumbling acquiescence of
San Francisco, there being no seeming
means of relief in view. But finally there
came into the local theater of events a
happening through which the port event
ually was led back to its old-time inde
pendence of operation. This episode â¢ is
narrated by a local historian in a book
published a few years ago, as follows*
"In the month of October, 1S91, there
sailed through the Golden Gate Into the
bay of San Francisco the ship Armida
flying the British flag. She was laden
exclusively with goods of American ma
terial, which were exclusively of Ameri
can manufacture. These had been brought
from Europe. She was followed by other
vessels, all of which had been laden in
Europe with American goods, which had
been exported to Europe from New York
The wares had been certified by American
FACTS POINT NECESSITY FOR PACIFIC CABLE.
When the Spanish fleet was defeated in
Manila Bay by the indomitable Dewey the
necessity for a trans-Pacific cable became
more apparent than ever before. The
news of the victory for the American
navy came from Madrid. Immediately
after the cable was cut and the United
States waited in suspense to hear the real
facts In the case. On this coast the need
for Instantaneous communication with the
leading. islands of the Pacific Ocean and
the Oriental countries and Australia has
long been realized. There Is general re
joicing among the shipping men at the
prospect of the early laying of a Pacific
cab'.e. of which the eastern terminus will
be San Francisco.
The advantages of a cable in times of
emergency have been Illustrated during
the campaigning in the Philippines by
the American soldiers. It will be recalled

MANUFACTURERS
ARE CONFIDENT
nrHEBE h&s been a marked
| increase of interest among
our manufacturers during
the past year in extension of
manufacturing. Both our
local and our outside markets
are growing. We are sharing
in the prosperity of the coun
try in this respect. The prac
tical solution of the question
of cheap fuel has done more
to place us, prospectively, in
high rank as a manufacturing 1
community than anything
in the history of the State.
Electrical power, genera
ted by our mountain water
supply, is virtually at our
door. Thus, with cheap and
almost unlimited power at
hand, the outlook, for great
extension of manufacturing
in this city and State is most
encouraging, and is attract
ing considerable attention
among Castern manufacturers
who are looking in this direc
tion with the view of estab
lishing manufacturing plants
here. \
There are indications that
the utilization of by-products
in manufacturing is increasing
with us. This is an important
sign of departure from old
and wasteful methods. The
returns from by-products go
far toward the support of
Eastern manufacturing plants
in some instances, and com
pliance with such methods of
economy among our local
manufacturers will greatly
aid them in meeting competi

consular officers not to have been made
dutiable abroad. Now they were reina
ported to the United States consigned,"
however, to a port other than the one
from which they originally departed from,
this country.
"They had twice crossed the Atlantic
Ocean, had journeyed around Cape Horn
to reach San Francisco and now at the
end of long and expensive voyaging came
in through the Golden Gate. It will sound
oddly when the future citizen of rian
Francisco is told that the purpose of this
circumnavigation of half the globe was
solely to save freight money â but such .s
the fact.
Clippers Under Control.
"The regular lines of clipper ships fly
ing the American flag, as they journeye-1
between New York and San Francisco,
were operated under subsidy agreement
with the many railroads included in the
Transcontinental Association. Clipper
rates had a3 a consequence been raised
until they were excessive. .Foreign ships
could not engage In the coastwise trade
of the United States. The Pacific Mall
Company moved freights from New York
to, San Francisco, or vice versa, only at
such rates and in such quantities as were
agreed upon by the officers of that cor
poration and the Transcontinental Asso
ciation.- Freights by rail proceeded only
at the highest rates that could be ex
tracted, and the shibboleth both by land
and sea was, 'Charge all that the traffic
will bear.'
"Years before this what had been known
as the special contract system had been
placed in operation against the city of
San Francisco. Merchants were cajoled,
bullied or bribed into making an engage
ment with the rail transportation lines
that a few days prior to the actual open
ing of the war between the United States
and Spain the Eastern Extension Com
pany, under an emergency 'contract with
the Spanish Government, extended Its
Hongkong cable to Manila from Balinao,
on the Island of Luzon." Admiral Dewey
was not able to have the cable neutralized
and. as a war measure, he cut it.
When Manila was captured there was
no cable or telegraph connections In the
Philippines worth mentioning. The East
ern Extension, Australasia and China
Cable Company abandoned their cables.
After Manila had been captured the In
surgents promptly destroyed the wires
leading out of the city. But the cable was
not so easy to destroy. The Filipinos had
not the means with which to pick up a
cable. The War Department of the
United . States, as soon as possible, ar
ranged to run cables to connect the va
rious principal Islands of the Philippine
group, and the work was to bo rushed by

not to move freight by sea. A tyrannical
condition attended this arrangement,
which was that the railroad people should
always have the power and authority to
open the books of any merchant with
whom they had this sort of dealing. A
merchant could thus be x detected by a
not overmerciful inquisitor, through evi
dence furnished by himself. If. not in strict
observance of the 'special contract.' â¢

"When the Armida and the other shipÂ«
Mere loaded to come to San Francisco, as
related, in the foregoing. In the year 1891,
for the merchants of San Francisco, the
events of the past had not been forgotten.
They remembered that the 'special con
tract' had even prohibited those who
signed it' from purchasing goods from
others who had imported from the East-
ern markets of the United States by sea.
"But there was good red blood in San
Francisco yet. If cargoes could not be
received by the lines of least natural re
sistance, under the protection of the
American flag, they could still, by means
devised by ingenuity, be secured from
Eastern points of supply via Europe and
Cape Horn at rates thai would leave the
dealer some reasonable share of profit.
"Communications had passed between
San Francisco shippers and the Treasury
Department of the United States, in
which the Question was asked whether
such shipments were in violation of the
navigation laws of the land? Seemingly
satisfactory assurances had been reJeived
that the acts in view were not elther'tech-
nlcal nor real violations of the law. Re
lying " upon this- view, several cargoes
were set afloat and were in due time
brought into the port of San Francisco.
"There was general astonishment when
It was ascertained that the Government,
while these cargoes were on the way, had
ordered that they should be confiscated
upon their arrival in San Francisco Bay.
The merchants were compelled to employ
counsel and to engage in costly litiga
tion, which extended in the Federal
courts in the Northern and Southern dis
tricts of. California through a period of
several j months. History says that the
merchants ultimately won this fight In
the courts, but the whole occurrence was
too much for San Francisco patience.
"Situated on a great harbor, which Is
easy of access, and having all the natural
advantages that belong to an Important
seaport, San Francisco merchants found
themselves ensnared . by legal cobwebs
and tied up by a transportation conspir
acy. Indignation was none the less deep
because it was not violently displayed.
San Francisco, if dispossessed of its nat
ural birthright of the free use of the sea.
had no claim to be considered as a great
trade center superior to an inland point
remote from the sea. Something must be
done. The hour had struck."
Ships Are Seized.
The ships that were seized while bring
ing cargoes in the manner described were
the following: Armida, October 16,. 1891;
Port Sonachan; November 5, 1891; Glenal
von, November 17. 1891; City of Delhi, De
cember 3, 1891; Alcinos, December 8, 1891;
Dumfriesshire. December 21, 1S91; City of
Benares, January 12. 1S91; Stockbrldge,

March 25, 1892; Eskasoni, April 2, 1892;
British Isles, April 12, 1892; Anaurus, May
28 1892 *
The goods that were seized had been
moved to Europe by trans-Atlantic
steamers, plying upon regular lines, and
had been reshlpped In the vessels just
named. That the legal attitude of the
merchants was correct has since been
demonstrated. The law has been amend
ed to prevent future shipments in that
way. Johnson & Locke brought out six
steamers from the Atlantic coast in 1891,
loaded, starting: the Atlantic and Pacific
line.

Oakland's Estuary.
The estuary on the east shore of the
bay of San Francisco is a great auxiliary
td the commerce of this port. The dredg
ing of the harbor has provided a haven
for many vessels, and the Government
work upon the. tidal canal will tend to
preserve all the benefits that have been

COMMUNITY ROUSES TO DEFEND
ITSELF AGAINST GREAT PERIL
Two Organizations Are Effected With Local Men at the Helm
Who Put Up Strong Fight and Succeed
in Winning Victory. s
THROUGH the assistance of the
Traffic Association of California,
which was organized by tho
business community of San Fran-
â¢ . Cisco, acting together, and " un
der the direction of Joseph S. Leeds,
means were taken to open up the port to
commerce without restriction imposed by
the overland' carriers. The first point of
attack was the clipper monopoly by way
of Cape Horn.
In May, 1892, the Merchants' Shipping
Association was formed in San Francisco.
The organizers were the following firms:
Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden â¢ Company,
Baker & Hamilton, Huntington, Hopkins
& Co.. Miller, Sloss & Scott, A. Craw
ford & Co.. J. W. Grace & Co.,
Hawley Brothers, Wellman, Peck & Co.
und I. S. Van Winkle & Co. L.. L. Baker
was the first president; A. Crawford, vico
president; C. E. Miller, secretary. Upon
the death of L. L. Baker and Andrew
Crawford, N. T. Romaine of Van Winkle
& Co. succeeded to the presidency and
Wakefleld Baker to the vice presidency.
The older carriers immediately lowered
their rates to kill off the competition that
was in store. A general meeting of mer
chants was called and then most of the
leading wholesale firms in San â  Francisco
joined the Merchants' Shipping Associa
tion. A. guarantee fund of $100,000 was
subscribed for the maintenance of the
competing line.
The following representatives of the
commercial interests of the city were ap
pointed an executive committee to car
ry on the competition around Cape Horn:
N. T. Romaine of I. S. Van Winkle &
Co.; Wakefield Baker of Baker & Ham
ilton: B. F. Dunham of the Dunham,
Carrigan & Hayden Company; Henry
Payot of Payot, Upham & Co.;
A. Cerf of Cerf, Schloss & Co.-
W. B. Wellman of Wellman. Peck
& Co.: F. W. Van Sicklen of

Co.; II. Michaels of Langley & Michaels
Company; O. E. Miller of Miller. Sloss

War Fairly Opens.
The first vessel of the competing clip
per line to arrive at San Francisco was
the Charles E. Moody, which came in No
vember, 1893. Other events â¢ had taken
place which were of the first importance
In determining the ultimate success of
the attemnts that were being made to
emancipate the shipping interests of this
port.
It should be said in passing that after
the Merchants'. Shipping Association
TIME WHEN FOREIGN GOMMERGE WAS BEGUN
It was not until 1S66 that a steamer en
gaged in the trade of the Pacific Islands
from San "Fj-ancisco. Then the steamer
Ajax made the pioneer steamer trip to the
Hawaiian Islands. In January of the suc
ceeding year the steamer Colorado depart
ed from this port on the first regular
steamer triD to China.
As early as 1S54, however, and occasion
ally for several years earlier, there were
steamers running along the coast, and
regular trips were also made as far north
as Vancouver Island. In 1854 a company
began to send coal down from Bellingiiam
Bay, and, in. the same year, the Russian
American Cpmnfcrcial Company brought
down its first cargo of ic2 from Sitka,
Alaska.
As early as 1S51 Ferdinand Vassault and
others brought Ice to San Francisco on
the ship Lucas from Boston. Five hun
dred tons of ice were brought on one trip
and also 1100 barrels of apples. When the
vessel reached San Francisco only 212
tons of the ice were left, but that sold at
12V> cents per pound and, as the apples
netted $35 per barrel, the venture brought
in a profit of nearly $40,000.
This success prompted the sending or
the Lucas to Sitka for a cargo of ice, but
the Russians charged Â»/5 per ton foreload
ing and the Lucas came back empty, but
then, the Russian American Commercial
Company being active, an arrange
ment was made with the Russian Govern
ment which insured the necessary profit
on the ice business to have it continue for
some time.
The Isthmus Route.
The construction of the Panama road
was delayed by various reasons until 1855.
Then began what was supposed to be the
fastest service that California could have
to New York. The success of the Pacific
Mail Steamship' Company was largely in
creased by the Panama road and new and
larger ships were put on. The time from
San Francisco to New York, by the Pan
ama route, was about twenty-five days,
which was called schedule time. Up to the
opening of the transcontinental roads in
1863, nearly all the mails from the East
came by Panama.
The coming of a steamer was always an
Important event, as it broueht the latest
news from the East. Outgoing steamers
frequently carried as much as $2,000,000
at one trip In dust, bullion or coin. The
"steamer day" originated that period,
which has for many years been peculiar
to California.
The shorter route to California, by way
of Nicaragua, tempted capital to invest.
An "Accessory Transit Company" grew
out of a contract made with the Nicara
gua n Government by Joseph L. White, in
behalf of himself. Cornelius Vanderbilt
and other capitalists of New York, to
establish a route of travel across Nicara
gua between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans. The qrigtnal project was to build
a ship canal. In 1S50 the contract with
Nicaragua was amended and then the

AS compared -with, the year
1900, in Which of all min
erals produced there were
$32,622,945, while no statis
tics have yet been compiled
for this year, it is safe to as
fcume that with the opening
up of the many new mines,
ioupled with a longer season,
h marked increase in produc
tion will be shown in almost
every mineral.
Noticeably is this the case
with copper, of which there
was produced in 1900 29,
575,512 pounds, of a total
value of $4,748,242, and
which will again be second
oaly to gold on the list of
mineral productions. Many
i.ew copper mines have been
opened during the past year,
and new smelters erected.
At this time the gold pro
duction cannot be estimated.
Undoubtedly a larger produc
tion will be shown than in the
year 1900, which amount
ed to 815,863,255, much of
â¢the increase coming from
Southern and Northern Cali
fornia. A large amount of the
gold produced in the latter
section is being â¢ combined
with the copper ores and ob
tained from those quartz
mines which have shipped
their production as a flux to

discontinued the Cape Horn . service
under their own management, it was
taken up by Grace & Co. and was car
ried on successfully. The collapse of the
great Transcontinental Association,
which took place before the â  fight
instituted by San Francisco in its
own behalf had come to an end, was at
tributed by competent observers to have
been due primarily and directly to the
competing Cape Horn line.
The rate cutting' via Cape Horn natu
rally affected the rail rates on all com
modities that could safely and profitably
be brought in by sea. The railroads,
already restive at the gage of battle
which the commercial community had
boldly thrown down, were destined to see
their scheme of tying up the isthmus
route as against San Francisco come to
an end..
Early In .1892. news was received that
there had been a falling out between the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company and the
Panama Railroad Company. These lines
H. L. BENDIXSEN, OLDEST
SHIPBUILDER ON THE PA
CIFIC COAST.
American Atlantic and Pacific Ship-Canal
Company was organized with an agree
ment to begin preliminary surveys within
twelve months and to complete the pro
posed canal within twelve years.
This scheme having been dropped, be
cause of impracticability at that time.
White secured from Nicaragua a charter
for a transit route. Steamers were put
on between San Francisco and Nicaragua,
the Pacific and the Independence, and
they began to run regularly in 1832. At
first the steamers went to Realjo. but
finally their destination was San Juan del
Sur â as soon as the road was built from-
Virgin Bay to the ocean.
A Rival" Line.
In time this route was a formidable
rival of the Panama line, for there was.
a saving of about 700 miles of sea travel
by the Nicaragua way; â  Eventually the
charter of the Vanderbilt company was
declared to be forfeited, this being tho
outcome of plotting by "Nicaragua
Walker." The line was broken up. â 
The whaling industry of the Pacific has
had its share of public attention. As
early as 1S55 Governor Bigler, calling to
the attention of the Legislature the de-
co-operated at ,the Isthmus of Panama
under a traffic agreement to the exclu
sion of all other lines, so that competi
tion by that route for the Golden Gate
had seemed to be beyond hope. But the
news of the rupture was confirmed. The
Panama Railroad Company was advised
by the Johnson-Locke Mercantile Com
pany of the situation In San Francisco,
and the" Panama Railroad people were
asked whether they would enter Into
competition with the transcontinental
lines in connection with a line of steam
ers to be run from San Francisco to the
isthmus.
After some negotiations in which the
Traffic Association of California took
part/ the Panama road agreed to com
pete and to put on a line of steamers on
the Atlantic^ to' connect at the isthmus
with a line to be put on by the San Fran
cisco commercial community.
Form Steamship Company.
The North American Navigation Com
pany was hastily incorporated, with
William L. Merry as president' and with
the following named directors: William
L. Merry, Frank S. Johnson, C. H. Has
well Jr., Frank Dalton, William Thomas,
Herman Bendel, A. B. .Field and J. J.
Moore. A guarantee fund being demand
ed by the Panama road management, the
commercial people of this city set about
to raise it. The amount demanded was
$200,000. The earliest subscribers to thla
fund were the following: Captain R. R.
Thompson, Alvinza Hay ward, Abble M.
Parrott, Herman Bendel, Thomas Magee,
William Babcock, C. Carpy, C. J. Hendry
Sons Company, A. W. Harriraan, "W. F.

Stetson-Renner Drayingr Company, P. J.

Louis Sloss ; & Co. furnished the first
steamer to run on this new line, the St.
Paul, which was chartered by the North
American Navigation Company. That
steamer went out through the Gate on
the 9th day of March, 1893. The water
front took a lively interest in this sailing.'
for the significance of the fight that was
now fairly on was well in view. What It
meant to the shipping of San Francisco
and to the commerce of the port was as
plain as a pike staff.
It is familiar history to the people how
the North American Navigation Company
ran for a period and was discontinued. A
practical demonstration of the strength
of the commercial position of San Fran
cisco and of her power to right wrongs
against her was demonstrated. With that
demonstration it may be fairly said that
the present era of shipping and San Fran
cisco's commerce was appropriately ush
ered in.
sirability of providing winter quarters for
the Pacific whaling fleet, made the state
ment In a message that there were then
engaged In Pacific Ocean whale fisheries
650 ships and barks manned by 15.000 sea
men and the capita] invested was not less
than J20.000.000. In 1853 there were 275 of
these vessels that visited the Hawaiian
Islands for repairs and supplies. They
were manned by 8000 seamen. Many
whalers found their fishing grounds in the
far north and passed by California al
together.
The objection that the whalers found
to wintering in San Francisco Bay was
the pilot charge of $S per foot, while the
charge at the Hawaiian Islands was only
51 per foot. On Governor Bigler's recom
mendation a bill was passed that allowed
whalers to enter and depart from the port
without paying pilotage; except that when
they engaged a pilot the charge was to
be 51 per foot. San- Francisco eventually
became the main source of supply for the
whalers of the Pacific and also head
quarters.
A FAVORITE RESORT
On San Francisco's Water Front.
Whenever you visit the water front
never fail to pay a visit to "The Castle."
There are two of them, but as John E. W.
Stange runs them both you will surely
get a welcome at either. They are two
of the most noted hostelries on East
street and during the past year or.so have
come into prominence owing to quality of
the wines, liquors and beer supplied iho
patrons.
John E. W. Stange, who started these
wholesale and retail establishments, came
to San Francisco many years ago on the
ship George Stetson. Later he made &
number of coasting trips and then Joined
the barkentine 3. N. Castle. He remained
with her for /over seven years, mak-n"
thirty-seven trips to Honolulu. Then he
decided to remain ashore and take unto
himself a wife. He is now the father of
the handsomest boy in the county, and
father and son arc inseparable.
â From Puget Sound to San Diego and
all over the Southern seas John Stange is
known and .everywhere his name ia a
synonym for square dealing.
At\ 250A East street, near Folsom, and
at ' the "branch" Castle opposite the
Oceanic dock Mr. Stange can generally be
found during the day, that is when the
business of the? wholesale department of
his enormous business does not call him
away. â¢ ." . â '.. . ;â¢ â  . . .
The Coast Range of mountains, or
rather the Coast ranges, for the spur3
overlap each other through the whole ex
tent, runs, almost parallel to the coast
the entire length of the State. The over
lapping of the many spurs makes a multi
tude of valleys, which, with their adja
cent foothills, constitute a very produc
tive portion of the State.

Ing, while the old sloop-of-war Slam, the
mail steamship Slam, the Stockton steam
er John Bragdon and the brig T. W. Lu
cas are shown in the bay. In talking
about this picture, William F.'Murray of
Murray Bros.' Machine Works says:
"The Great Republic was the first four
masted ship ever built in the world and
came around the Horn from Boston. She
brought a general cargo here and made
a record .voyage. '.-
Brought First Ice to This' Port.
"The Zenobia came here from Sitka In
charge of Captain Kentzell. The latter
was later well known as a captain of po
lice. The Zenobia brought here a cargo
of ice, and she Is shown in the picture
discharging the first ice brought to San
Francisco. To the left of the picture Is
shown a shack owned by the Russian-
American Commercial Company (now the
Alaska Commercial Company). Into it
the ice was unloaded. At that time it
was full of sawdust, and I guess many
a San Francisco boy will remember the
days when we went in swimming and
dried ourselves In that sawdust.'
"The old sloop-of-war Slam is ofr. Al
catraz, while in the foreground Is Bell
Ross' cottage and the North Point ware
houses. The old cottage is gone, but the
warehouses are still in the old location."
Mr. Murray came here in I860 on the
old ship Spark and has been in
business ever since. -,,-.-
Among some of the men identified wKh
the water front who came here in the
early days is Captain H. H. Watson, the
marine surveyor. In the old days he
sailed a launch over the place where his
office at 303 California street now stands
Over fifty years ago he came here as
master of the ship Croton, and still
laughingly asserts that she- came around
the Horn stern first.
"The old clipper ship Dreadnaught was
a crackerjack in her time," said Captain
THE SAl* FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1901,
Watson. "Captain Samuels, father of tre
gentleman now with J. Â£>. Spreckels &
Bros. Company, was her commander, and
a finer old gentleman you never met. She
made some cracking runs and will always
be remembered. She went . from New
York to Liverpool in twelve and a half
days and that was better than the steam
ships could do in those times.
"Then there was the ship Challenger,
Captain Robert Waterman, which made
the fastest time on record between New
York and China. The Challenger was a
clipper and no one of the old timers re
quires me to tell him anything about Bob
Waterman. Then there was the Ocean
Express and a dozen others that made
Uncle Sam famous the world over. The
old days were great days, boy, and the
new vessels are big carriers, but they
have not got the heels that the old ones
had."
Among the young generation, on the
front are the Bender Bros, and TuchlÂ»r
& Ranzulo. Their business is as widely
separated as the ends of the earth, but
all are native sons and honorable gentle
men. Bender Bros, have lately been
merged into the Union Wood and Timber
Company, but the firm still has offices on
the corner of East and Market streets.
George L. and Will A. Bender have been
connected with San Francisco shipping
for years and the well known schooner
Bender Bros, was named after them.
Ike Tuchler and Anthony A. (Tony)
Ranzulo are the proprietors of the Mer
chants' Inn. Ike is a native son and a
graduate from the public schools. He has
held many public positions and is a mem
ber of many fraternal and charitable 'or
ganizations. Mr. Ranzulo came here
when a child and was raised in San Fran
cisco. For years he was with Hilbert
Bros, and then joined issues with Mr.
Tuchler and started the Merchants' Inn.
out of which they have made a splendid
success. "Tony" is well known In ath-

Coast's Oldest Shipbuilder.
Perhaps the oldest shipbuilding concern
on the coast is that of H. D. Bendix^en
of Eureka. More vessels nave come from
his yard than from any similar concern
between San Diego and the Sound, and
not one of "Ben's" boats but has prove'!
a success. The steamship Humboidt,
which came from his yards, is a stand
ing monument to his ability as a ship
builder. .- .
Next in order with Bendixsen comes
Hay & Wright. The founder of the shlp
buiiding'business of Hay & Wright, Alex
ander Hay, commenced the building of
vessels in the year 1880, the location of his
first yard being at the Potrero, where the
Arctic Oil Works now stands. , Later he
was located at North Beach, and still
later removed to Sixth street, where a
great work was carried on. In the year
1S89 the company located its plant at Ala
meda Point, at which time K. B. Wright
became associated with Mr. Hay. In lock
ing over the list of steamers, schooners,
dredges, etc., which this company has
turned out in the past twenty years one
is impressed to think what a great
amount of responsibility must have rested
on these men's shoulders in the execution
of such a vast amount of work.
F. L. Pritchard and E. F. Taylor form
the firm of Taylor & Pritchard. Former
ly it was Taylor, Adams & Pritchard, out
Mr. Adams dropped out about a year ago
and now the concern is run by two of the
most popular men on the fjont. Taylor
& Pritchard have been at their present lo
eation on Market street, near East, for
nearly a generation.
Leaving the business men for a moment,
Thomas Crowley and brother are two of
the most noteworthy characters on th^
front. Everybody knows â  "Tommy." His
father taught him boating and ever since
he has been making his living on tha
front. The Crowley brothers own some
of the finest launches on the bay and
have a good share of the shipping busi
ness.
Nearly all the motive power in the
launches of both Peterson and Crowley,
and, in fact, nearly all the launches in
the bay, comes from the Union Gas En
gine Company. The latter was organized
in 1891 by W. J. -Casey. He was formerly
with the Regan Vapor Engine Company
and then, with John F. I)aly, bought out
the rights of the Pacific Gas Engine Com
pany. The two then organized the pres
ent concern, which has its engines and
vessels all over the Southern Seas and
throughout Alaskan waters.
Is there anybody who lives in Marln
County that does not know G. H. ("Gus")
Kilborn? He was for five years on the
Sacramento River and then went on the
Sausalito run. His father was on the
river boats when "Gus" was born and
his son naturally followed in his foot
steps. "Gus" runs the most popular. fall
excursions that ever leave San Francisco
and his catering on the ferry steamers is
beyond reproach:
John Twigg & Sons are the best known
boatbuilders on the bay. The sons John
F. Twigg and James A. Twigg now run
the business and their launches and
yachts are known from one end of the
coaat to the other.
In the old days the yards were at the
Potrero, but now the principal place of
business is at North Beach. y
New Lines of Steamers.
Among the new steamship lines that
came to the coast during the past year
or so were the Kosmos, Pacific Steam
Navigation and the Companla Sud Amer
icana de Vapores. The two latter are
Scuth American lines, while the Kosmos
has its home port in Hamburg. The first
of the latter company's fleet arrived here
in December, 1899. In 1S00 they only sent
twelve vessels to San Francisco, but this
year the number, has grown to eighteen,
and next year the company expects to In
crease the number to twenty-six. Lendal
M 1 . Gray is the manager and J. WC. Com
fort the freight agent at this port.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company
and the Companla Sud Americana de Va
pores are working together and running
alternate vessels between here and Val
paraiso. They have made a wonderful
success of their venture and the lines will
be augmented by three new steamers in
the near future.
Hind, Rolph & Co. and J. R. Hanify &
Co. are among the younger firms that
have made names for themselves, during
the past few years. Both have come into
prominence through strictly legitimate
means and their business on the seas. has
grown in consequence. Starting with one
vessel, Hanify & Co. now manage the
steamers Santa Barbara, Santa Monica,
San.. Pedro, South Coast and the sailing

CALIFORNIA SOLDIERS PROVIDE
TWO VERY STRIKING PAGEANTS
Arrival and Departure of Citizen Warriors Give Rise to Most
Moving Spectacles When Wharves- Blaze
ON the 25th day' of May, 1893, San |
Francisco saw something new in
its history. Then the First Call- j
fornia Volunteers, the Second}
, Oregon Volunteers, five companies !
of the Fourteenth United States Infantry
and a detachment of United States heavy
artillery went - out through the Golden
Gate en route for the Philippines. There
were four vessels In the fleet which bore
the citizen soldiery of California, Oregon,
the regulars of the United States army |
and their escort away to the war with \
Spain across the width of the broad Pa
cific Ocean. On the City of Peking were
the' Calif ornians, who were naturally, be
ing the sons, husbands and fathers of
San Francisco, in receipt of the greater
share of attention.
The steamers . in the flotilla were the
City of Peking, the City of Sydney, the
Australia and the cruiser Charleston. The
latter acted as convoy to the merchant
steamers which emergency had caused to
be metamorphosed into transports for an
American army on a voyage of conquest
i in lands in the southern seas.
The Calif ornians broke camp at the
Presidio on the 23d of May and marched,
down to the Mail dock. San Francisco,
at once- proud and tearful, had its heart
upon its sleeve that day, as the band
played, the crowds cheered and the rela
tives of the. departing soldiers saw the
beginning of the warlike progress of their
nearest and dearest. But when the day
came for the departure through the Gold
en Gate the spectacle was maritime.
! Local dignitaries of various degrees em
barked in tugs, and the din of steam
whistles, hoarsely blown all along the
water front, and the roar of cannon were
among the farewell sounds that the sol-,
dier boys of: the several commands heard
as they sailed away. . ,'.' â 
Before the start various craft, all
dressed as for a gala day, circled around

Jessie Minor and Soquel.
Richard Sweasey, president of the Hum
boldt Steamship Company, is one of the
best known men on the coast. Mining
men, shipping men, investors and seafar
ing men all know Mr. Sweasey, and -when
ever he comes to San Francisco there is
a crowd to meet him. As head of the
>Humboldt Steamship Company he has
>-made a great success of that concern and
the corporation is more than on Easy
street. . - - ".-.-.
A new firm on the front that has had
wonderful- growth Is that of O'Callaghan,
Nelson & Co. The principal members of
the firm were formerly with Ross & Hew
lett, but when -that concern' dissolved the.
present firm came into existence. Both
Mr. O'Callaghan and : Mr. Nelson ; are
known from one end of the front to the
other. "Dan" Is a member of all the
athletic clubs, a splendid business man
and a thoroughly good fellow. â 
The Ferry cafe is a good stopping place
during a tour of the front. Louis Arzner
and "Teddy" Osborne, old-timers on the
Oakland ferry-boats, will be there to meet
you, and a cordial welcome is extended.
It is one of â¢ the coziest corners on the
front, and many a good lunch has been
served there.
One of the best known men on the front
is Lorentz Foard. Lately his business on
Market street has been merged into the
Lewis Anderson Company, and the con
cern Is now known as the Lewis-Ander
son-Foard Company.
Lorentz Foard came here nearly a gen
eration ago and at once made his home
PACIFIC COAST SHIPBUILDERS HOLD HIGH RANK AS CRAFTSMEN

here. Among the: names of the mas

the three transports. There were band3
which played patriotic airs and one that
played "Annie Laurie." -
Uvery boat which came near the ships
received from the boys the order "blow
your wUistle," and the whistle blew.
Then from the crowded deck and the rig
ging where they clung would come a se
ries of hurrah, hurrahs, to which a spon
taneous reply was certain, and trie
clamor hardly knew pause.
There were cheers for the Governor and
the State officials, steaming alongside in
the show of â  gold braid. There were
cheers for the meanest boat afloat if only ;
it displayed the red, white and blue.
Every, one know3 how the soldiers went
out through the Golden Gate; how Brig
adier General Anderson of the regular
army of the United States, in command
of. the expedition, was In command on
the Australia; how well they fought In
the Philippines; how regiments from dif
ferent States of the Union came into
San Francisco, encamped and then went
away, at intervals, on the transports
across the sea. The white-hulled vessels
that carried the red, white and blue
shield and the red, white and blue fun
nels became familiar objects . after
awhile, though never failing to attract
interest.
Probably the Interest ran even higher
when the First California Volunteers re
turned from the war in , the Philippines,
and the demonstration made on the bay
and at the Golden Gate was worthy of
the occasion. History for the bay wa3
made on that day by the aid of artists
and the pens â¢ of gifted writers. The re
turning Californians came Into port on
the transport Sherman, which arrived in
sight off the heafls on the 23d of August.
1899, but which was held outside until the
following day,' that the great naval pa
rade, arranged as the initial - token of
welcome to the returning soldiers, .night
be arranged. ''
On the 24th along the wharves were
\ gayly decorated vessels of every descrip-
on the- front. He grew with the shipping
and is now one of the representative men
on the front. His old place on Market
street will be occupied by . the AlamÂ«da
cafe. This little concern has grown to
such proportions that its owner Is glad
of â  a chance to secure larger quarters.
In the meantime Mr. * Foard will retain
his old quarters on Steuart street.
Port's Big Shipping Concerns.
There are people on the front who re
quire no advertising. Everybody knows
them, and as bulwarks of the commerce
of San Francisco they are known the
world over. Of such are J. J. Moore &
Co., : Balfour, Guthrle ,& Co., the Pacific
Coast . Steamship Company, the. Oceanic
Steamship Company, the Humboldt
Steamship Company, Hind, Rolph'& Co.,
John ' Rosenfeld's Sons, the Shipowners'
and Merchants' Towboat Company. Madi
son,' Bruce & Sellars, John S. Kimball,
the Charles Nelson ..Company and the
Dollar Steamship Company. Who is there
from end to end of the Pacific slope that

Moore, Robert ! Dollar. Edwin Goodall,
John D. Spreckels, "William Babcock.
Charles Nelson, James Bruce and a host
of others who are now the moving spirits
In the port of San Francisco? They are
here to stay, and the number of vessels
they are adding to their fleets every year
shows that the business of the port is in
creasing. -
About the best known of the Custom
house brokers are Swayne & Hoyt and
W. H. Thornley. Everybody knows
"Billy" - Thornley, and a better fellow
never breathed. Swayne & Hoyt have
madeyrapld progress during the past
years, and the firm now does a leading

neared,' the ships left their moorings and
their docks. Music, patriotic and.exhila
rating, floated over the waters of the
bay. Cheers born of the contagion - of
excitement and enthusiasm sourded from
the wharves. Now and then came the
booming of a signal gun and the answer
of waving flags and cheers. Down tjja
bay the vessels steamed toward the Gold
en Gate. The hour for the horr.e-coming
of the CaUfornians was approaching.
The steamers and other vessels formed
into two lines, leaving an avenu-3 of clear
water between them. Then the Sherman
entered the Golden Gate on her Lomeward
way and was greeted with the familiar
music of cannon as the forts volleyed at
her and the artillery on the shipping
added to the din with their guns. - The
Sherman steamed down the avenue be
tween the ships. Soldier forms were
clinging to her rigging. Her decks were
black with moving figures. Cheer upon
cheer echoed on the air, and wlti punctu
ating precision came the roar of guns
from the forts. How the greetings wera
interchanged between the men on the
Sherman and the men, women and chil
dren on the other vessels cannot be told.
There were cheers, words of love, anx
ious questions and sad answers.- So thÂ«
Sherman came home and the bay added
another chapter, of unique history to Its
annals.
Since then soldiers have been coming:
and going at intervals and commerce has
been stimulated by the large business ofi
furnishing supplies for the men at the
Presidio, on the transports and at the
Philippines. Ships that were at first
taken from their regular runs on the Pa
cific Ocean were restored to their old
places in many cases, while the Govern
ment arranged Its line to the Philippines
with more care and deliberation than was
at first possible. -

Bird's-Eye View of the Risdon Iron and Locomotive Works, Potrero, San Francisco.
THE main shops and the ship
building plant of the Risdon Iron
I Vk'crks are located on the water
I frcnt of the Potrero, between
JL Nineteenth and Twenty - second
streets.
The property consists of thirty-two
acres, lying between Georgia street and
the shore line, which is here nominally
Massachusetts street, and includes â¢ the
former site of the Pacific Rolling Mills.
The main entrance is at Twentieth and
Louisiana streets, four blocks east of
Kentucky street, on â which is the near
est electric-car line. The main line of
the Southern Pacific Railway's bay shore
extension is three blocks from the en
trance on Illinois street. From this a
spur runs down Twentieth street through
the main gateway, which is forty feet
wide, and there spreads out fan shaped
into four branches. All these tracks are
interconnected by curves of 150 feet
radius, allowing a choice of two or three
routes from almost any point to .any
other, thus preventing the annoyance and
delay of blocking traffic. For Instance,
there are four possible routes from the
machine shop to the shear legsâ the ulti
mate destination of ali large marine
work. The total length of tracKage
about the works Is four miles.
The general arrangement of the
buildings is as follows: North of Twen
tieth street is located the shipbuilding
department proper. It consists of the
mold ioft and ship tool building, pla-te
racks and the shipbuilding ways. South
of Twentieth 6treet the first tier of build
ings is as follows, going toward the bay:
New office, blacksmith shop, angle-bar
shed, warehouse, joiner and ship-pat
tern shop and nreproofing and riggers
shops. The next tier south consists of
machine shop, storeroom, â  power-house,
copper shop and boiler-house. The fol
lowing tier contains the erecting shop,
extension to the machine shop, pattern
chop, boiler shop, foundry, flask shop
and flask yard. There is a complete line
of wharves on the bay frontage, includ
ing a fitting-out slip, surrounded on
three sides with wharfage and railroad
tracks. It will be noticed that the grounds
axe amply provided with railway facili
ijg^âjn fact a track has been laid
wherever it could be of use. As all the
curves are 150 feet raflius, the usual
flatcars and railway yard locomotives
have access to all parts of the works.
The complete track system also makes
it possible to utilize all the space not
occupied by buildings for storage. Ma
terial and all heavy articles are carried
about the works by three yard or locomo
tive cranes, having a capacity of ten tons.
These are also used for switching cars.
The buildings are constructed of struc
tural steel, covered with galvanized cor
rugated iron, thus being fireproof
throughout. The foundations are con
crete piers. Under the machine shop,
boiler shop, foundry and blacksmith shop
piers are laid upon bedrock, as the site
of these buildings has been excavated
from the surrounding hills. The ship
too! building columns and each separate
machine rest upon concrete piers nine
fee* deep, which, in turn, are built upon
piles from seventy to ninety feet long,
driven to bedrock. The joiner shop is
similarly supported, though the distance
to bedrock is not so great.
The lighting facilities are ample indeed.
Each shop is completely equipped with
arc and incandescent lamps, so that work
can be carried on continuously night and
day when necessary.
Power.
Four kinds of power are distributed
completely throughout the worksâcom
pressed air, hydraulic, steam and electric.
Compressed air Is used for hoists, drills,
riveters,* calkers and other pneumatic
tools, the provision for the ship building
and repairing plant, wharves and fitting
cut slip being especially complete.
Hydraulic power is used for large riv
eters, punches, jacks, drop forging
â¢ . ' â  ' - â  â  " â  â  . â -.--.' _ . . . . . . â  - :'â -'â â¢â  â  â 
presses, hoists, keel plate bender, etc.,
and also for testing.
Steam is used outside the power-houso
itself, for steam hammers and heating
purposes.
The main source of power, however, is
electric. Nearly all machines, except the
special hydraulic and pneumatic and the
steam hammers, which require over five
horsepower, are independently -driven by
electric motors. The smaller machines
are belt driven from line shafts, each
having its own motor.
The Power-House.
This Is a thoroughly modern, one-story
steel structure, 75 by 100 feet, situated in
the center of the plant. It is the produc
ing and distributing point for the differ
ent power systems mentioned above, and
also serves for the salt and fresh water
distribution for drinking and fire pur
poses, as well as petroleum distribution
for the boilers, blacksmith shop and boiler
shop fires.
The boilers (now being installed) are of
the Heine watertube type and will event
ually supply all the power used in the
1 works. They are oil burning, as are also
those upon the locomotive cranes.
The electrical equipment includes:
Two 250 K. W. static transformers, 11,
, 000 to 440 volts.
Two 150 K. W. static transformers, 11,
' 000 to 196 volts.
One 50 K. W. static transformer. 2200 to
â  110 volts.
Two 25 K. w. static transformers, 2200
1 to 110 volts. ......
; Two 10 K. W. Btatlc transformers, 440 to
â  110 volts.
! One 250 K. W. rotary converter, 196 to
! 220 volts. . > . â 
1 All are supplied with the necessary
â  switches, ammeters, volt meters, watt
; meters and other requirements. At pres
ent power is taken from the mains of tho
; Independent Light and Power Company,
, at 11,000 volts, two-phase, 60 cycles. Pro
â¢ vision, however, has been made to Install
- generators which will furnish all the pow
â  er reauired.
The direct current system is used to
1 operate all the overhead traveling cranes
â¢ and two or three small motors.
â¢ The alternating current system supplies
â¢ power to the remaining motors and the
i arc and incandescent lamps.
I The hydraulic power system is supplied
Â» by a 150 horsepower, triple throw, dou
â¢ ble acting pump, driven by an induction
i motor. This pump produces a pressure of
| 1500 pounds per square inch and feeds a
I battery. of four accumulators, which au
i tomatically control the output. The pow
â¢ er is then distributed through "a- system
Â» of manifolds to the various departments
t The compressed air is furnished by a
â  200 horsepower, two stage, intercooled
l compressor, directly connected to a com
â  pound Corliss engine. Provision is made
. for adding more when required. The com
pressor delivers through a receiver to the
â¢ mains at a pressure of 100 pounds per
â¢ square inch.
t The fresh and salt water systems dis
- tribute through the manifolds throughout
, the plant, the former direct from the
> Spring Valley mains, the latter from a
; 16x9x12 inch Smith-Valle fire pump which
I will deliver 750 gallons per minute. This
> is governed by a Metz pump governor, so
> that it keeps a constant pressure on the
5 mains. As the salt water is also used for
i condensing and sprinkling, the grounds the
( pump is constantly In operation, thus b.e
5 ing ready at all times for emergencies.
Â» By a system of valves the fire pumps can
be changed over to the fresh water sys
tem if necessary, or in case of fire will
! operate both until the arrival of the city's
c engines, when the latter will take fresh
1 water, leaving the salt water system for
the shop force. .
There Is also in the power-house a 100
horsepower induction motor driving a line
1 shaft which operates a blower for the
. blacksmith â¢ shop fires, an auxiliary air
compressor and an auxiliary hydraulic
' pump. . ... >
a Oil System.

Ship Tool Building. â¢
The mold loft and ship tool building
has been very carefully designed and is
perhaps the most thoroughly and elab
orately equipped' ,for saving labor and
turning' out work rapidly of any in
America. â¢â  â â¢â â¢â â  .
It is of steel, 320 feet long by 65 feet
wide, with an additional 15 leet of over
hanging shed running the full length.
This side is open, the columns being 40
feet apart and facing the shoreward ends
of the shipbuilding | ways.".
The mola loft floor, having a perfectly
clear expanse of 65x320 feet, ;ia- probably
the largest in America. Being supported
every ten- feet by latticed girders-five
feet deep, it is practically rigid.
The most noticeable feature of the ship
tool shop is the elaborate system of trol
leys ana crawls for distributing material
and handling it at the machines.
There are twenty-four crawls, ranging
from 6-foot t to 17-foot span and are sup
plied with I cross trolleys for handling
plates and angles," nine 3-foot gauge trol
leys running , on tho through . tracks for
distributing material " and two narrow
gauge trolleys for handling angle bars at
the. double. angle shears and angle planer.
f Down the center â  of the shop â  is - a row
of S six large double-ended punch and
shearing machines, over which are two
lines of track carrying twelve crawls of
11-foot span each. Completely around
these runs a through track carrying four
3-foot trolleys for distribution. Just out
side this oval are 6-foot gauge tracks for
the , four, small single-ended punches or
shears and the two 30-foot plate planers;
13-foot gauge tracks for the mast rolls
and straightening rolls, and clear across
one end are two 17-foot gauge tracks
completely covering the large 30-foot
bending rolls, which will take a plate two
and a half Inches thick, and the hydraulic
keel bender, which. will bend a plate four
inches thick.' Material is brought in on
a 3-foot track running the entire length
of the overhanging shed â  and extending
beyond enough to take from the .Gantry
crane running over the plate racks. The
3-foot, track is - twenty-three ' feet â¢ from
the groundfT allowing the locomotive
trains to . swing underneath the railroad'
track, paralleling the trolley just outside
the shed., All the other trolley tracks are
fourteen feet from the ground. All the
crosstracks run out to meet this through
track;' so 'that -material can be taken to
any machine, in : the shop or the finished
work : removed i without disturbing ' any
other machine even when all are in ' use.
Besides the machines mentioned above,
there are two radial counter-sinking and
drilling ; machines . working . over a long
roller table and various smaller drill
presses. . j _ __ . _â

, The Growth of the Eisdon.
The Risdon Iron and Locomotive Works
though entering upon a remarkably era of
expansion, so extensive and divergent
that the old landmarks of its development
are quite lost sight of, is yet one of the
oldest and best established manufactur
ing institutions on the Pacific Coast. In
the early days, when mining was the
crime source of wealth on this coast, its
machinery was the most important manu
factured. The Risdon, being a pioneer In
this field, has grown up with it, expand
ing as -it- developed and - contributing ita
full quota of original inventions, improved
forms and labor-saving devices, .which
have made California's methods a model
of mining on a large scale as a practical
science the world over. Though this will
always remain an' extensive and lucrative
field other lines are developing into even
greater magnitudeâ shipbuilding, for in
stance Into this the Risdon is prepared
to bring the same energy, improved meth

steamers.

The second department is': that of ma
rine engines, high pressure, condensing
compound, triple or quadruple expansion;
! marine boilers of the latjst Improved
Scotch, locomotive type or water-tube, for
burning eltber coal or crude petroleum;
condensers, feed pumps. dlsitilllng appa
ratus, evaporators, refrigerating and lea
machines, steering engines, windlasses,
' winches, coal and ash handling machinery
âand, in fact, all that goes to operate an
ocean-going steamer of the largest and
most elaborate type.
Mining Machinery.
The .third or mining machinery class 13
so broad that only a Dare mention can be
made of the various types. For mining
. proper there are hoisting and pumping en
' gines. steam, hydraulic and portable, and
rock-drilling, tramway and ventilating
machinery. For ore reduction there are
smelting furnaces for silver, lead and
copper, reverberatory and mechanical
roasting furnaces, revolving a.nd kiln ore
dryers, stamp mills, roller mills, concen
trators and chlorination works. Amonjr
the specialties in this line manufactured
by the Risdon are Bryan roller mills,
Johnson concentrators, steel whims. Hos
kins' giants, Wright calcining furnaces.
Pelatan clerici process machinery and
Evans' hydraulic elevators. Among the
different methods of mining one in partic
ular has become of paramount Importance
in the last few years. It is working tho
gold-bearing river beds by means oC ,
bucket and even caisson dredgers. â¢â¢ (
ThÂ© Riadon has built a great number^
of those and holds the exclusive rights
for building the R. H. Postlethwaite
dredge, undoubtedly the most successful
one on the market. As evidence of this
might be stated the fact the.t four years
ago there was no successful dredger
working in California, although many
were left as failures on the banks of riv
ers throughout the State.
Since the first Risdon dredger was built
on the Feather River theri have been
over thirty of them made, and tbe Ris
don is now building nine cf these ma
chines. The dredgers have not only been
used in California but are in operation
all over the Western StateÂ« and among
the gold districts of Africa, Alaska and
Mexico.
Structural Iron Work. 1
In the fourth classâ that of structural
iron and steel workâ the Risdon has con
tributed to the most important recent
building operations of San Francisco, no
tably the Union Depot, or fÂ«rry building
and the Claus Spreckels building.
Mention should also be made of tha
Spreckels Sugar Companys plant at
Spreckels. Monterey County, California.
The main building is 582 by 103 feet, six
stories h|gh and contains over 3600 tons cf
structural steel.
Engine and Machine Work.
The last class, comprising
engine and machine work, contains many
diverse branches,, some, notably sugar
machinery and hydraulic machinery, be
ing almost of sufficient Importance and
magnitude to rank with the main groupo.
The former includes most of the machfrlL
ery used on the sugar plantations of tUW
Hawaiian Islands, consisting: of crushers
vacuum pans, filter presses, settling
tanks, etc., besides engines trash burn
ing boilers, pumps, water wheels, motors,
etc.
In hydraulic machinery ths Risdon is a
pioneer, having built the real prototype
of the modern tangential water wheel with
reaction buckets, frequently e^U-d the
Pelton type" water wheel. They have
built these extensively, for many years,
the later example being three 3000 horse
power water wheels, directly connected to
polyphase alternators for the Bay Coun
ties Power Company. Another important
branch Is that of hydraulic steel pipe
building, of which they are the most ex
tensive builders in the world.
The miscellaneous group is too exten
sive and diversified. to allow of specifying
more than a few types. For Instance.
Corliss engines, Risdon air compressors.
Heine ' safety ;watertube boilers, Smlth-
Vaile pumps, all sorts of Manufacturing
and special machinery, boilÂ«r fixtures, all
kinds and sizes of valves, pneumatic and
hydraulic tools.
