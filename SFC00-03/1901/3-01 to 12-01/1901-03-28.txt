SCENE OF THE SUEPRISE.
The news of Aguinaldo's cap
ture indicates clearly that the
plans of General Funston were
carried out successfully.
To carry out the programme
required a long march into the
interior and never-ceasing ' cau
tion to guard against treachery.
The troops in New Vizcaya and
New Ecija and the gunboats
Vicksburg and Albany were or
dered to co-operate with the cap
turing party.

Rugged trails, in some places be

Under these circumstances he considered

quite a colony of Filipino exiles. There
he first came in contact with the world

school of the United States, was many
fold better than that within reach of most
of the little Luzon natives, of whom, un
der Spanish rule, but a small per cent
learned to read or write.
General Funston's plans, as
outlined in a dispatch from
Manila a few days ago, were to
make the trip over the Isabella
Mountains to Aguinaldo's hiding'
place, accompanied by Sur
geon Major Harris, Captain
Newton, of the Thirty-fourth. In

burg on a remote beach north of
Baler, and were to proceed over
land, guided by a former officer
of Aguinaldo, who had betrayed
to Funston the Filipino leader's
abode.
PLAN OF THE CAPTURE.
As the leader of an insurrec
tion against the United States
Government Aguinaldo may be
tried and executed, a lesser pun
ishment meted to him by execu
tive clemency or complete amnes
ty extended. While the question
of punishment rests with the mili
tary authorities, it is believed the
President will make the matter
one for determination primarily
by the authorities here.
believed, however, that any defi
nite line of action was ever de
termined upon in regard to the
matter. The attitude of the Gov
ernment for a long time past has
been one of comparative indif
ference to Aguinalcfo's capture, it
having been determined* to crush
the rebellion without regard to
his whereabouts. His recent ac
tivity in directing the course of
operations against the American
forces probably brought about
the recent change in this attitude.
The disposition of Aguinaldo,
now that he has beer, apprehend
ed, will be an interesting one for
the administration to determine.
The possibility, of his capture at
any time always has been kept in
view, and that of his future has
been a matter of informal discus
sion bv the officials here. It is not
templated.
CAPTURE POLL-OWS ACTIVITY.
The capture of Aguinaldo will
be a source of great satisfaction
to the President and his advisers.
Coming so soon after the surren
ders reported by General Mac-
Arthur of prominent Filipino of
ficers and the successful estab
lishment of civil local govern
ments by the Taft commission,
they feel that the end of the re
bellious warfare in the islands is
near at hand. With the expected
collapse of further opposition,
which it is confidently believed
will follow, the hope is expressed
.that it will not be necessary to
maintain such a large standing
armv in the islands as is now con-

Then was to come the daring
part of the plan. The pretended
prisoners were to throw aside
their assumed character and .*net
amorphose themselves from pris
oners to captors, seize Aguinal
do, beat down any opposition
tKat might show itself and hold
their prisoners, no matter how
great the peril or how great the
forces of the enemv.
They were to make it appear
that they had captured General
Funston and other American of
ficers of high rank and were tak
ing them into the camp of the
insurgent chief to be delivered as
prisoners of war.
To deceive the enemy it was
arranged that Aguinaldo's repre
sentative, who had given the in
formation to the. Americans,
should lead the native scouts,
they to assume the character of
insurgents still loyal to the rebel
cause.

W.. WASHINGTON, March 27.-While the
Senate Committee is preparing. to Investi
gate the charges of a combination of Gov
ernment officials to influence" the regula
tion of hemp exports from the Philippines
a scandal has broken. out in connection
with the Havana customs. It Is charged
that blackmail on an extensive scale has
been collected In Havana by. persons de
claring their ability to Influence the 'War
Department. The report from : Havana
that a gas company of that city had paid
$49,000 In commissions within the last two
years to have the tariff on crude petro
leum adjusted satisfactorily cannot ba
positively confirmed in Washington. It is
understood, however, by persons who are
well informed as to what Is going, on. In
Cuba that' money was paid to some one
who said he coula Influence the action of
the War Department. f
"No information hus ever. come to the
War Department," said Lieutenant Col
onel Edwards, chief of the bureau of In
sular affairs, "as to the alleged payment
of this money. If the company paid this
amount,, or any other amount, whoever
received It had nothing to do -with bring
ing about a change in the tariff on pe
troleum, and the gas company never ap
peared by attorney before the department.
The only person with whom the depart
ment had correspondence on the subject,
with the exception of the customs officials
in Cuba, wers.T. J. of Balti
more, president, ana J. Bacardi of Ha
vana, vice president of the company."
Lieutenant Colonel Edwards said that
General Wood, by direction of the Sec
retary of War, issued an order restoring
,the 70-cent duty and no such petroleum
had actually paid a higher rate. He said
tho company had not been represented in
the matter by an attorney and there was
no occasion for the payment of any money
to any one to secure a cofreetion. By an
executive order: which will go into' effect
on April 1: the petroleum tariff is again
revised, the only change being an increase
of the rate of refined oil to $3 50, which
Is higher .than the present ' rate, though
$1 70 less - than -is wanted Â¦ by- the -refiners.
A statement is being prepared in the in
sular division giving all the details of
these tariff changes with all the r corre
spondence, and the officials say It will
â¢how a perfectly clean record.

Father Phillips nsked Morgan If he

that his attitude up to the present has
been toward the prevention of a strike.
He said he was much interested in the

possibly; attendant conclusions might
hamper the achievements of the best ends
which all were seeking. In other -words,
as Morgan remarked, should he hold a

added that the ends sought could best be
achieved through other channels, and he
assured the delegation that he might com

All the while, however, he .seems to

â¢ Snar.lPh liuthoritles, becoming alarmed at
the suooess of the insurgents and ih<3
Â¦widespread srowth of me movement,
made proposals that If tbe revolutionists
would lay down their arms a.id the lead
ers leave the country the Government
would pav all the expenses of the proceed
ing, the 'wages of all the troops, wouid
agree to prosecute no one Involved in trie
uprising and would put through all tnÂ»
reforms that Dr. Riza! had demanded,
the refusal to listen to which had led Â«.o
the Insurrection. ,,
Aguinaldo, with the other leaders, dls
cussed the proposals at length. Some were
in favor of accepting them; others, of
more fiery temper or distracting the .Span
iards, wanted to continue the fight ana
drive the Spaniards into the sea: Aeuin
aldo. with some others, urged that the
proposals be accepted upon the condition
that'the Spanish Government should give
some more tangible guarantee than ver
bal promises, a vague and indefinite agTes
nvnt in writing. Having thus secured a
3un in -the flshtlng and some dissension in
the ranks of the insurgents the Spanish
authorities then employed briber}', cajol
rry-- and trickery and at last won their
point. .
The agreement was entered Into between
the Government and the insurgents. , Tho
latter, headed by Aguinaldo. kept their
agreement to the letter, disbanding and
laying down what arms they had. The
leaders left the country and established
themselves In Hongkong to watch the
progress of events.
The Spaniards failed to keep their prom
ises of reform, if they ever intended to do
to. and mercilessly pursued and destroyed
all those within reach who had taken any
part in the insurrection.
Instead of paying over the money agreed
upon, somethinirgver $1,000,000, they gave
to Aguinaldo, ti3 Hongkong, less than
one-third of that amount, which they
raised from the budget and special taxes,
and pocketed the rest. They, however,
published the report that the whole was
paid over, and thus led many people, to
believe that Asuinaldo and his colleagues
had followed the Spanish practice, and
kept the money for themselves. There
was bitter quarreling in Hongkong and
charges of embezzlement and fraud were
freely made in the revolutionary councils.
What Became of the Money.
This imputation upon Aguinaldo's honor
and fidelity to his people has been effectu
ally refuted by the managers of the Hong
kong and Shanghai Bank, one of the
largest and most upright Institutions in
the world, by showing that the money
admitted to have been received by the
Aguinaldo group, some $300,000. was all
that was remitted by the Spanish Execu
tive Council at Manila.'
It is said to be susceptible of positive
proof by unimpeachable evidence that
none of this money was ever diverted by
Aguinaldo or his associates to their pri
vate use.
The Filipinos were ripe for another up
rising- when Admiral Dewey, on May 1
1S98, arrived in Manila Bay and crushed
the Spanish squadron. Aguinaldo 'was
quick to see his opportunity. With the
money he had held in reserve he pur
chased arms and ammunition, crossed
from Hongkong to the Philippine Islands
and received a warm welcome. In a few
weeks 50,000 men were enlisted under his
command. "With some "munitions of war
supplied by the Americans he armed a
small percentage of his followers. Others
used bows and Tirrows and other primitive
weapons. With this poorly equipped and
half organized following Aguinaldo took
town after town from the Spaniards, until
he controlled nearly the whole island of
Luzon, with the exception of Cavite and
Manila. The Dart he played in the cap
ture of the city of Manila in co-operation
with the American troops and the subse
quent events leading to the collision with
the United States troops on February 4
1SS9. is recent and well remembered his
tory.
Insurgents Badly Scattered.
As the result of the campaigns conduct
ed by Generals Lawton, MacArthur and
others the rebel leader's forces had been
badly scattered during the two years of
guerrilla warfare. Aguinaldo himself, at
tended by a comparatively small band of
followers, fled to the mountains and for a
year his actual whereabouts had been
more or less a mystery.
Major March with a detachment of the
Thirty-third Regiment overtook what was
believed to have been a portion of Agui
naldo's escort last June. A fight followed
in which several were killed, but the wily
leader. If indeed he were with them, again
made good his escape. Major March con
tinued the pursuit and for several days
was hot on the trail of the insurgent gen
eral.
Saddlebags containing Aguinaldo's di
ary, private papers, addresses to oeople
of civilized nations and copies of seVeral
speeches delivered in the United States
Senate, were captured and aroused great
interest in this country.
Attempts at Capture.
After most arduous and persistent ef
forts to overtake the fugitive Major
March saw the futility of continuing the
pursuit with a force of Infantry and re
luctantly decided to retrace his steps to
Cervantes. After Aguinaldo's night to
the mountains he was bereaved by the
death of his wife.
Other plucky attempts were afterward
made to take the Filipino chief, but they
were unsuccessful, and the impression
had grown that it was impossible to cap
ture him until an announcement made a
few days ago Inspired renewed hope
when it was stated that General Funston
the plucky Kansas principal in a dozen
hair-breadth escapes, had started with a
email following to capture the rebel
leader. " -.
Aguinaldo is said to owe much of his
Influence with his people to his .person-'
ality and his magnetic qualities. He is of
medium height, but lithe and strong. His
face is highly intelligent and "derives its
character largely from his piercing black
eyes. He always dresses neatlyr so-much*
fo, indeed, that he has been accused of
foppery, and the golden whistle* which he
is said to have worn habitually about his
neck has been subject of many a Jest. '
His bearing Is soldierly and he habitu
ally conceals his emotions behind an im
passive countenance and affects a stolid
ity of manner. He has excellent com
mand of language, and in conversation or
oratory Is terse, direct and convincing
His popularity among 'his own people
could not be better attested perhaps
than by the fact that, at least until now Â¦
none of them -has ever sought to betray

He said:,'
Not Yet Beady to Talk in Reference
"I am very glad, I am sure, to hear the
news. I am more than glad to know that
a Kansan was the Instrument in securing
the man. It was a great deed. Kansas
has had many unkind remarks .made at
her expense recently and I hope those' who
have made them will now have words of
praise for our State on account of Fun
ston's exploit. Kansas has reason to be
proud of the achievements of her son."
"What effect will this have on the Phil
ipplne trouble?"
"1 think that it will cause the disturb
ances In those districts to cease. With
their leader captured it will be dishearten
ing to Aguinaldo's followers.
"I am very Bure that all- of- the people
of Kansas will be as glad as I am to hear
that General Funston has captured
Aguinaldo. His adventure was watched
with Interest and much anticipation and
the successful termination of the enter
prise will cause rejoicing not only in
Kansas, but over our entire nation." â¢

TV*., WASHINGTON. March 27.â Russia
has again formally disavowed any inten
tion to acquire Manchuria or other Chi
nese territory.
Count Cassini, the Russian Kmbassador,
has reiterated to Secretary Hay the as
surances heretofore given that if the ac
tion of other powers does not prevent it,
Russia will, as soon as peace and order
are restored in Manchuria, withdraw her
trocps. He has furthermore Informed Hay
that the convention which Russia has ne
gotiated with China specifically an
nounces that Russia proposes to restore
Manchuria to China Immediately upon the
return cf norrr.al conditions. The conven
,tion is solely for the purpose of facilitat
ing the restoration of order and the fu
ture protection of Russian rights, hereto
fore authorized by China.
These assurances have been received by
the administration with gratification and
have hwn accepted without reservation.
Whether they have likewise been made to
ether powers is unknown here, but even if
they have, the course Germany. Great

pretext for- territorial " acquisition, and
<Jreat Britain and Japan have informed
the United States that they will regard
the signlrg of the convention as freeing
them from the obligations they assumed
to preserve the integrity of China.
In view, of the Russian purpose" to re
f-tore Manchuria to China, a diplomat paid
to-day that he did not Bee how the gov
ernments named could be absolved from
their solemn pledges to maintain the in
tegrity of the Chinese empire, and if they
extended their sovereignty over territory,
then, he said., they, could justly .be
*charg*Â»d Â¦with bad faith.
No frerh representations regarding the
Russian convention have been made by
the United States, and it is not under
stood that any will be made. A member
of the Cabinet said to-day that the United
States is not concerned with the political
and territorial aspects of the Chinese sit

the United States will demand guarantees

the trade and treaty rights hitherto pos

In view of the fact that no advices have
been received from either Peking or St.
Petersburg, the State Department does
r.ot believe the Manehurian convention
has been signed, but does believe that
this will be the outcome.

Long to-day cabled an order to Admiral

force and in the ordinary practice of di

It 1^ said that the United States Consul
General, who had conceived that obstacle*
were purposely placed in the way of his
access to the court, has received assur
ances that the actual reason for the de
parture of the court from Morocco was
to pay a long due visit to another section
of the country. It also was promised that
the court would return within a month or
six weeks and would /receive Mr. Gum

overland journey to the capital.
In this view of the case, and the New

It Is reliably reported that at a Minis

reasons, not to mention the disastrous ef

will be excluded .from the university for

It Is rumored from trustworthy sources
that the Government has decided to make
unofficial concessions to the students, and
accordingly the military regulations
against student agitators are, therefore,
set aside for the present, although there
will be no public announcement to this
effect for some time. The prisoners will not
be drafted Into the army. This is onÂ© of
the results of the Ministerial meeting.

HANFORD. March 27.â The City Council
For the last month gossip has been rife
and after the scene at the house on St.
Patrick's morning a -suit for divorce has
been expected daily.
The McHenry's were married in March,
18S6. Mrs. McHenry . was Miss Louise
Bilicke. daughter of the Los Angeles hotel
man; the groom was rlcl>and well known
and everything augured well for a happy
union. There are three childrenâ Robert

aged -Â¦ 12, and Ora -Louise McHenry, aged
9. Mrs. McHenry is now llvlnsr a.t the
McHenry home in' Modesto: her husband
is living on his ranch, known as the Bald
Eagle ranch, six miles out of the town.
Though the lawyers are reticent it is cer
tain that there will be no -reconciliation;

jection on that score.
Then there is more about how Mrs. Mc-
Henry was shadowed by detectives put
on her trail, she says, by her husband:
how she was . frequently told she could
go out on the strsct and shift for herself,
and how she was kept reminded of tho
fact-,that the.housa she lived In was not
hers, even to the extent of a "board or
nail." And all this time her. friends keut
her posted on the connr.gs and goings of
McHenry. an J the latest things tho town
was saylnsr of the. whole affair.
All these escapades came to Harht in
1900, but they werÂ» kvjpt in the background
until the people of Modesto began to talk.
no difference nor did it lessen tho objec
tion of Mrs. McHenry. .
-There was trouble caused by the fond
ness of McHenry for the society of a
young and pretty governess who used to
teach his three children and it wound up
in an invitation to the governess to seek
employment ! elsewhere. There were- tales
of a Â¦ trir> to the mountains, by a party
composed of McHenry, his two boys anil 5
the boys' "aunt," who had come out from
Boston to care for them unon tho death
of their mother. At the time Mrs. Mc-
Henry was alive and well and living in
Modesto.' and it was t'- - !s Â¦which finally
led to the vacancy in the position of
governess to the. small McHenrys. Thpre
was another time, too. which Mrs. Mo-
Henry recalls, when her husband returne-1
from a trip. to the East, whither he had
taken the two boys. The three came bacn
to San Francisco, where they remained
over, and the boys brought home the fact
that they had met tho pretty governess
in San Francisco. And not onlv Â¦was <t!ie
fact of the meeting Drought home, but
the governess as well, and it was. only
after Mrs. McHenry threatened to call
Â¦ the police that there was again a vacancy
in the educational deoartment of the Mo
Henry household.
And there was anotherâ the wife of an
employe â who, with her husband, sudden
ly left, for Europe and did the "grand
tour." although - the ; only Income of : th3
family was the- monthly wage which the
husband was earningâ or.e not more than

SOME OF THE ACTORS ANDjSOME OF THE INCIDENTS "WHICH LED^
THE MeHENRYS OF MODESTO NEARLY INTO THE DIVORCE
COURTS AND THEN INTO AN AGREEMENT.
It was of her husband's love affairs,
however, that Mrs. McHenry had most
complaint. He was of a keenly susceptible
nature, and. according to her story, the
year 1900 was a bad ; one for him. Mrs.
McHenry had particular objection to her
husband's aunt, Mrs. Gussle Hewett.who
is described as "young and comely," and
she made strenuous objection to Mc-
Henry's evident preference for the society
of his prepossessing relative. Mrs. Hewett
lives in Stockton, but the distance made
In the meantime the complaint for di
vorce had been drawn up by Mrs. Mc-
Henry's attorney and had the settlement
not been arrived at it would have been
filed to-day. It told a tale of woe that
would have won a divorce for any one,
and. in the number and variety of the
co-respondents, was a curiosity in its
way. It told of cruelty and threats and
vile epithets and concluded with an ac
count of what happened last St. Patrick's
day.
â¢v It seems that McHenry returned from
a* trip to Arizona on March 17 and arrived
at his home* in Modesto about 5 in the
morning, where he proceeded to awaken
the household. How he did it forms an
interesting chapter, and he concluded by
driving away the hired man, the horse
and buggy, and the new governess-who
was teaching the children.. Then he got
an ax and proceeded to demolish a few of
the doors. He finally drew a revolver and
threatened to shoot "some one," and
caused a good deal of excitement to the
household generally. i~J9Hi38tt*flaBi3O8aÂ» r 3
The complaint; which was made ready for
filing, contained pages . of typewritten
matter that would have supplied food for'
small .talk at afternoon teas for a year
and a half, and the allegations made
showed a willingness on the part of Mrs.
McHenry to prove that her husband was
a gay Lothario of the first rank. Tbe
terms of the compromise have been kept
strictly secret, but it is certain that Mc-
Henry did not. set oft with anything under
$100,000. He has seven good jj figures to
draw upon and the report around Modesto

was deeded to McHenry by his mother.
She probably did not get such an amount,
but it is equally certain that she will not
emerge from the settlement without a
bank balance that will last her for the
rest of her days.
The agreement to effect a settlement
without recourse to a suit was reached
last night after a long conference, between
Frank M. Stone, attorney for Mrs. Mc-

from Los Angeles for the purpose; J. L.

Obirpo counties.
citizens have boe.n discussing the boom
that is exacted to result from a strike
that has Ix-en made in the San Ardo oil
fields. Karly this morning a report
report reached Salinas that a big oil
pusher had been Etruck on thÂ© Tomboy
claim at San Ardo. about eixty-five miles
Fouthwest of Salinas. Full details are
lacking, but it Is said that there is a
Bteauy flow of oil from the well, spouting
out in tsuch volumo that it has not yet
boon pot under control. â¢ The strike was
mad<- at a depth of 1140 feet.
Boring for oil in the San Ardo district
began only last fall and the drills of the
Torribov Company were the first to pass
the 1000-loot limit. There are five com
panies operating In that vicinity and from
the outset the outlook has been favorable.
The drills of two* of the companiesâ the
Tomboy and the Monterey â had encoun
tered oil at depths of id) and 930 feet. re>
Fpectively.-and apparently it was only a
question of time when they would pene
trate lanre underground streams. When
the report was r<-ceived this morning: that
a snsher had been struck there was a.
rush for the scene. It was said that bo
fore night threo saloons had been opened
at San Ardo.
Simultaneously with the encouraging:
r.ews from Â£an Ardo came the report that
almost at the same hour oil liad been
struck in a well on the northern boundary
of San Lui? Obispo County. The extent
Of the etrike could not be leajr.ed.
These discoveries bear out the claims
of oil experts, who have asserted that
Monterey County overlies one of the
richest oil district beds in California, and
residents are looking forward to a. boom

follows:
Harry Allen, a Stanford undergraduate,
who has been leading a "strenuous" life,
has been discovered decorating some
sphinx with green paint by an elderly gen- i
tlernan, whom he supposed to be a ;
wealthy uncle. Discovering that Profes
sor Palmer, an eminent Egyptologist, Is
about to resuscitate a mummy, Allen re
solves to impersonate the mummy and is
accordingly brought to life with due cere
mony by Palmer and his colleague. Pro
fessor Gormley. I
Fred Bleeker. a supposed friend of Al
len, has been making love to Clara
Palmer, Allen's sweetheart, and takes
advantage of his friend's supposed ab
sence to press his suit. After many
vicissitudes Rameses, the resuscitated
mummy, commits suicide in a very novel
manner and comes back as Allen In the
third acz. The supposed uncle Is dis
covered to be a visiting professor and the
perfidious Bleeker is forced to content
himself with a charming pupil of the
Santa Rosa Seminary, while Allen is ac
cepted by Miss Palmer. The professors
are heartbroken over . the death of
Rameses, but console themselves with the
thought of resuscitating an Egyptian
Princess, while Tim Gohegan, a, dime
museum manager, who has contracted to
exhibit the sacred person of Rameses, is

Public Invited.
One of the most appreciated of the many
branches of philanthropic work carried on
by the National Red Cross Society for
the benefit and elevation of the American
soldiers is the free distribution of 'read
ing matter. This is true particularly in
respect to that portion of the army in the
Philippines, where the soldiers are de
prived of almoEt everything which tends
to make life pleasant. Thousands of the
men are stationed in remote towns and
bairlos Tind for months at a time hear
nothing from the outside world. In such
localities the men are- eager to get hold of
reading matter of any kind and the Red
Cress Society has been answering this
want, to the great pleasure and profit of
the recipients.
The supply of books and papers, how
ever, which was bo generously giverrby
the public in answer to the call of the so
ciety last December, has been almost en
tirely exhausted and considerable solici
tude is felt lest this most worthy charity
may not be continued.
It is earnestly requested, therefore, by
the members und friends of the society
that the public assist by contributions of
suitable reading matter, in the way of
papers, magazines and books, or by do
nations. Reading matter and communica
tions may be s-ent to the "Manila Li
brary," Phelan building.

The last match of the day was between
Mrs. Haslett and -Miss Hunter, and the
fact that v both the ladies claim the cham
pionship of Alameda County added con
siderably to the interest of the match
Mrs. Haslett defeated her opponent in
straight seta, the score being 6-3. 7-5
Mrs. Haslett played a very steady game
while Miss Hunter seemed a trifle off in
her play.
The next match was between Mlsa Em
ma Hunter and Miss Miriam Hall and
the former fell an easy victim to her more
skillful t opponent. It was thought that
Miss (Hunter would make the champion
put forth her best efforts to win, but the
outcome" was never In doubt, as Miss Hall
wonâ 6-1, 6-1.
Only three ladles pcrtlcipated, but they
were the best on both sides of the bay.
Miss Miriam Hall, the coast champion,
representing San Francisco, carried oft
the first honors. The second prize fell to
Mrs. Haslet t of Alameda, who defeated
Miss Emma Hunter, also of Alameda.
On account of tho small entry the tourna
ment was played on ihe round-robin plan.
5 The first match of the day was between
Miss-Hall and Mrs. Haslett and was won
by the former in straight setsâ 6-1, 7-5.
The scheduled ladies' singles tourna

and Harry Corbett will be at its head and
front. Although no definite plans have as
yet been made for the organization of the
club, tjbe matter has' been given full con
sideration: by Corbett and the preliminary
steps have been taken.
When interviewed last night Corbett
paid: "It Is true that I have been consid
ering- the formation of a boxing t club and
have undertaken the first steps toward its
consummation. I do not wish to say more
at the present time, but it is almost cer
tain that In the very near future the club
will be organized and its sole purpose will
be to give the very biggest fights obtain

Humor had it last night that Jim Ken

would forsake his former business asso

emphatically denied, averring that the

Milt had 'the mount on Sam Hildreth's
colt, Rolling Boer, the 3 to 5 favorite for
the mile purse run, and when the barrier
flew in /the air was 'in perfect enjoyment
of an Oriental "pipe Â¦.lroam." All the glad
ness of a" winning season was crowded into

left, which later was increased tenfold
when Redwald walked home before Wil

Dick Dwyer came in .for a mild rebuko
from the crowd assembled about the stand
for not having ordered the bellboy to cull
Henry earlier: then Henry himself re
ceived two or three dozen groans, after
which there was an Mprcarious appeal to
the stand to declare beis off. This was
an impossibility. The more conservative
arid anti-recall flag men smilingly took
their medicine, and the incident waa
closed.
A 20-knot breeze blew over the course

dition the time exhibited would indicate It
to have been slow\ Contestant wore the
empty honor of being ilie only successful
favorite. The defeats of Parmenion, Pre
judice. Rolling Boer, Fondo and Vesuvian
caused some very touching separations.
After a protracted let-up George Mil

ance in the first event, a six furlong sell

to 1. The good thing, Tor he was played
down to 4, got a flying start,- and though
once passed by Foul Play and the favor

paddock. Foul Play nosed the first choice
out for place honors.
Harry Stover's Contestant, favorite for
the two-year-old scamper, was very for
tunate in getting- the decision over Bruns

speed the first time out at Oakland witn
a stable boy up and was the warmest kind
of a tip. the books laying but 5 to .2
against him. When the barrier was re

the leaders.
Both the favorite. Prejudice, and the
second choice Goldone, finished behind

front by Ransch at the turn, only gal
loped the balance of the route. Goldono
stumbled soon after the mart, nearly go

WOODLAND, March 27.â Charles Me-

Edge Club of Sacramento has had a
string oft for some time, has been atjrned
by the directors of the Woodland Club.
If any doubt existei In tne minds of thÂ»
members of the Olympic Club that Al
Hampton was not entitled to the title of
champion handball player of the coast
they were removeJ last night when he
defeated George James and William Cart
wright In a specially arranged match. Ha
outclassed his opponents with the same
margin as a thoroughbred would & "sell-
Ingr-plater." Hampton was simply invin
cible and had he exerted himself there Is
no doubt that he could have prevented
James and Cartwrlght from dolnj aa well
as they did.
James played a splendid srame. He
fought for every point and did remarkably
well in "killing" the ball. Cartwrlght.
however, did not play with that judgment
and skill for which he Is noted. He over
reached himself time and again In his
effort to return the ball.
Cartwrlght and James took the first
game without much effort, as Hampton
was not then exerting himself. In thÂ»
second same .Hampton turned the table*
and won out handily. Hampton's killing
in this set was brilliant work. In the
third game Hampton again captured the
honors. He used an Eastern ball that was
as lively as a tennis ball and he sent it
out to the backwall with great speed.
Hampton again took things easy in the
fourth game and James and Cartwrlght
won out. Both sides bad two games to
their credit and all went in to win the
flnal game. It was a grand struggle on
the part of James and Cartwrlght to avert
defeat, but their efforts were unavailing.
Hampton won out easily.

extended Invitations were eagerly ac
cepted and one by one those on the list
of the select called and paid their re
spects. Herman Oelrichs -was the first to
greet the Easterners. He called while the
party was lunching in the ladies' grill
room. Smith came out and after a cordial
greeting insisted on Mr. Oelrichs "coming
in and having a 'small black' with the la
dies."
Mr. Smith is a Wall street broker who,
a few years ago, inherited a modest for
tune of something like $50,000,000. He is a
bachelor and is considered very eligible
in the most exclusive society circles of
New York. After the luncheon Mr. Smith
was approached by the local representa
tives of the press. He allowed them to
get within earshot of him. but at their
first Question as to how long the Ush
party would remain In the city, he as
sumed a startled air and beat a hasty re

sight. He admitted, however, that this
was his first visit to the coast and he was
having a very cood time.

GOVERNMENT AID
IS NOW DESIRED
Board of Trade Committee
Seeks Co-operation of
Other Bodies.
A very Important meeting will be hold
this afternoon in the rcoms of the San
Francisco Board of Trade relative to tho
muchly discussed topic of the establish
ment of a direct Una of steamers between
San Francisco and Manila. It is possible
that an alternative proposition will be en
tertained and that measures will be taken
to secure the co-operation of* the National
Government in providing- the desired fa
cilities. For some weeks a committee of
the San Francisco Board of Trade has
been gathering informadon from majiy
sources, the purpose of the work being
to ascertain what volume of freights couM
be safely expected to move from this pori
to Manila direct. Severa. meetings have
been held. A meeting of the committee
was held Tuesday afternoon.
It was then decided to ask the other
commercial bodies of the clty^the Mer
chants' Exchange, the Produce Ex
change, the Chamber of Commerce and
the Manufacturers' and Producers* Asso
ciationâto send representatives to a meet
ing to be held this afternoon. This
amounts to an enlargement of the com
mittee.
What will be done is enly to be conjec
tured. The proposition of requesting thosa
present to unite In a telegram to be ad
dressed to the Government at Washington
aaklng that some of the freight carried
by chartered vessels in the transport ser
vice for the army In thu Philippines be
transferred to regular lines now running
between San Francisco and the Orient, so
that It may be possible to run these
steamers direct to Marila without loss
has been talked over. Conferences haws
taken place between the committee and
the officials of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company and the volume of freights ana
the Philippine business has been discussed
to some extent. It has appeared to be tha
fact that the business between San Fran
cisco and the Philippines on private ac
count is somewhat limited. Much of tha
through freights from the Middle Wcsi
is diverted from this port by the Northern
transcontinental lines and goes across
the ocean by the Empresa steamship line
Much business goes via the Suez canal.
Under all the conditions outlined In ch.s
foregoing It has c<rcurred to some of thos<Â»
concerned in the Philippine trade that the
aid of the Government might be invoked
profitably. This topic will come before
the enlarged committee for action thin
afternoon.
A musical* of unusual Interest will be
riven for the benefit of the Buford Free
Kindergarten of South San Francisco at
the Colonial Hotel Friday at 3 p. m. Be
sides an interpretation of several numbers
of Wagner by Miss Anne Wilson, selec
tions by local vocal artists will be ren
dered.
The Buford Kindergarten is a worthy
charitable organization, whose efforts are
constantly being exercised in behalf of the
children of the poor of South San Fran
cisco. This organization Is accomplishing
a splendid work and never before has
had to ask for outside assistance, but
owing: to the unusual demands made upon
its resources by reason of its constantly
expanding field of usefulness this con
cert has been arranged. It promioes to be
well attended, for many of the best known
women of the city are lending their efforts
toward Its success.
Theatrical matters are conspicuously
quiet this week. Two theaters, the Cali
fornia and Grand Opera-house, are dark
for the week, the latter in consequence of
the failure of the Sembrich Opera Com
pany to fulfill Its engagement. The Cali
fornia opens April 15 with Neil Burgess
in the "County Fair." and Morosco's
will present a new Eastern stock com
pany in a spectacular production of
"Cliidcrtlla" on Saturday evening, April 6.
The Frohman production of "The Little
Minister," minus all the New York stars
that lent their stellar glory to the play.
Is on for this and next week at the Co
lumbia Theater. The play itself Is a dis
tinct success. Mr. Barries dramatization
of his Â¦rharminp novel hclnp as clever as
the hook itself, but the company that Mr.
Frohman presents Is hardly adequate to
the task of presentation.

have put on, and will doubtless -wear well
for another couple of weeks. "The Idol's

operas, will follow.
The Alcazar has a winner in "Too Much

Standard Company . Making Exper
iment That Will Have Interesting
Besult&rrRates for . Trans
portation Discussed. ,
The prtsent week is fraught with Inter
est to the oil producers of. California. On
Saturday, next the Standard Oil Company
will open bids for supplying 25,000 barrels
of oil. Bidders are given the option to
furnish the entire quantity of 25,000 bar
rels or ar.y part of the same. ,^ The seem
ing purpose of this option is to get as
many bids as possible and so determine
what the oil producers will sell their prod
uct for. What effect this move will have
on. the price of oil is a question which is
concerning 1 the trade generally. Much'de
pends on the producers, who are invited
to compete practically without regard to
quantity, in naming a price at which they
will sell. According to very good author
ity, the Kern River district alone, which
is now the largest producer in the produc
ing section of the State, can pump 15,000
barrels per day. with the present wells
working to their full capacity. The Ba
kerslield Californlan," which Is near the
field, makes these figures and adds that
not one-nf th of that amount is being mar
keted now "and not a few companies are
reservolrlng their oil, pending the time
when a market is opened."
Superintendent Miller- of the Standard
Oil makes the statement that the offer of
the company to buy 25,000 barrels Is purely
experimental and that the result will de
termine the future course of tho company.
What will the producers sell their oil for
under such conditions? There has not
been a more interesting question asked
in California since . {he oil industry as
sumed such large proportions. /
The Transportation Hatter, j
Coincldentally comes the report of a com
mittee to the California Petroleum Min
ers' Association, which deals in statistics
to some extent. It sets forth that the
oil producers of McKittrick find serious
fault because they have to pay the same
rates for moving their, oil. to Bakersfield
that they pay to San Francisco, Â¦while the
Kern River district producers 'complain,
that it costs them more to deliver their
oil In San Francisco, than it does the Mc-
Kittrick producers. The discussion of the
rate problem is of general interest. The
committee says in part: Â¦â¢
The charge should be uniform, irrespective of
the length of haul, for the reason that the
production of crude oil In f this State has be
come a great industry, and when considering
a rule of action or the measure of rates to .be
charged, the fact of encouraging an Industry
rather than destroying It should be taken into
consideration. If rates are made favorable to
one locality they necessarily must be unfavor
able to another, and we who are at present
producing oil in the Sunset. McKittrick, Coal
lnga and Kern River districts would cer
t.aln>y feel injured If new oil discoveries wera
made say, for instance. In the neighborhood of
Mount Diablo, and the producers be enabled to
railroad their oil into San Francisco at such
rates, based on distance, as would shut out
oil produced in the districts named. If the
rate Is uniform, no new discovery, no matter
how near the point of consumption, could bar
the oil produced in localities more remote.
The actual cost of transportation of a car car
rying from 150 to 175 barrels of oil Is, when
loaded, 3 cents per mllfi per car. In view of the
fact that the urade from our California oil
fields to San Francisco is down grade, it is
reasonable to suppose that the cost here is less
than the 3 cents per mile above mentioned.
But taking that as the actual cost to the rail
road companies, then the cost of transporting
a car of oil from I3akersfield to San Francisco,
a distance of 312 miles, would be $9 36; and
allowing the same rate In returning the empty
car the total cost would be, from point of
shipment â¢ to destination and return, J18 11.
whereas the charges now are from $63 to $73 50
per car, accor'lnc to . the number of barrels
carried.
The committee recommends a rate of 23
cents per barrel, irrespective of the dis
tance to San Francisco, and quotes the
following:- (
"When oil. was first discovered it was selltng
at $2 50 per barrel, and the freight charge was
from 62 cents to 65 cents, about 25 per cent ot
tho celling: price of ttie oil. When the price
of oil fell to $2 and J2 10 per barrel, the rail
road of Its own accord reduced the transporta
tion charges to 52 cents per barrel. "When ths
price of. oil was reduced to $1 60 or $1 70 per
barrel, the transportation rate went to 42
cent3 per barrel, at which It has since been
maintained, notwithstanding the price of oil
has greatly fallen. It will be seen that the
railroad charges have been always In the
neighborhood of 25 per cent of the selling price
of the oil, nnd the present rate should be re
duced accordingly.
The freight rate, with oil at the present
price, Is a matter of great importance to
the producers.
Work in tho Field.
There are now about 50.000 acres filed
upon for oil in the Mojave desert. It is
reported that a trace of oil has been
found on the desert, about twenty miles
west from Barstow, In San Bernardino
County.
Mucn excitement is reported to exist in
Chico on account of the discovery of an
oil seepage about six miles north of the
town on O. L. Clark's ranch. The oil was
first seen by a farmer, and It was floating
on a creek. The discoverer traced it up
and found where the oil was oozing from
the ground.
Drilling for oil has begun on a tract of
10,400 acres near Vacaville. The Vacavllle
Reporter says that State Mineralogist
Cooper looked the land over and found
that there was gas escaping from several
places, but he would not hazard an opin
ion concerning the probability of finding
oil in paying quantities. -Another opinion
was secured. After some delays the ma
chinery was bought and work is under
way. *
Development work in the vicinity of Gil
roy. says the Gllroy Gazette, is extremely
active. Before the fnd of May there will
be thirty-two derricks in operation. About
4000 acres of the Dunne ranch have been
leased to a company for a term of ten
years. The lands are taken on a. royalty
and the agreement is that drilling must
begin within ninety days.

Present Week Indicates the

OIL PRODUCERS
TESTING MARKET
The proceedings yesterday In the trial of
Peter McGlade, ex-bookkeeper In the of
fice of Superintendent of Streets, were
devoted 'to legal ; arguments between the
attorneys for the prosecution and the de
fensÂ© as to the admission in evidence of
the "John Sullivan" salary warrant,
which McGlado is allseed to have forged.
The Jury was granted a vacation aiv.l
after hearing the arguments of counsel
the ' day closed with a victory for the
prosecution by the decision of Judge Mc'
vln to allow the disputed document to.be
filed as evidence in the case.' .
The objection of Attorney Lennon, for
tho defense,' as to the admission . of the
alleged forged document was of vital in
terest. If the document had' been denied
admission to the record the result would
have been that Expert* Kytka and his
elaborate display of enlarged specimens
of handwriting would nave been thrown
out of. court and the case for the people
would have falien to the ground. Attor
ney Lennon's much vaunted claim that
the "corpus delicti" hau not been proved
would have held good ai-d McGlade would
have gone forth a. free man.
Attorneys Fear Court's Displeasure.
Judge Melvin* s threat of Tuesday that
he would punish the opposing counsel for
breach of court rules had its effect yes
terday. Attorney Lenncn was as mild as
a lamb and neither District Attorney By
ington nor Assistant Eugene . Deupr.?/
"mixed" in their, oratorical displays.
Judge Melvin kept an eve on the counsel
and, despite a few pardonable infractions
of the order, the lawyers did not offend
the dignity of the court.
Theodore Kytka.the argumentative hand
writing expert, was called to the witness
stand when court convened In the morn
ing. Before Kytka had a chance to ex
plain his exhibits Attorney Lennon start
ed off on a long argument. He tried it
head off Kytka's .proposed testimony
by arguing that the "John Sulli
van" salary warrant was not a subject
of forgery in that it did not comply with
the law in its composition. The attorney
for the defense soucht to prove his con
tention by producing various resolutions
of the Board of Supervisors and the con
solidation act and pending the arrival of
the same Kytka was allowed to explain
his enlarged specimens of handwriting.
When Kytka started in to explain the
photographic exhibit on his 15-foot screen
some of the jurors took a hand in the pro
ceedings. The expert persisted in sayin?
"This is taken from the salary warrant
forged by Peter McGlade," or "This U
Irom the books of the ofllce and in the
writing of McGlade.** Attorney Lennon
scored a point by having the testimony
thus presented stricken from the record.
Some of the jurors wanted to know why
the "salary warrant" so frequently men
tioned was not in' evidence and also If
Kytka was employed by prosecution anri
defense. To these queries Judge Melvin
replied that the questions were improper.
Expert Kytka Talks at Length.
Kytka was Instructed to exolaln his
screen and for an hour the expert 'tcld
how he had taken {specimens of writing
from the books of the Superintendent oi
Streets and .enlarged them by his photo
graphic process, the same- being- done with
the writing on the alleged forged salary
warrant. â¢
While Kytka was in the midst of his ex
planation Clerk McGinnls of the Board ot
Supervlpors arrived ' with the documents
desired by Attorney Lennon.* 'Â¦Â¦ McGlnnis
was placed on the stand and testified as
to certain resolutions of the Board of Su
pervisors and the consolidation act, which
he produced. These documents were
placed in evidence by the defense.
At the request of the defense John Sulli
van, the hodcarrier, was recalled to the
stand and testified that he had never lived
at 3036 Twenty-second street at any time.
Lennon sought to prove by the witness
that he was not the "John Sullivan" de
scribed in tho "salary warrant" and that
his testimony previously given was of no
value in that he had sworn that he had
never indorsed the alleged forged war
rant. â¢
Lennon Hakes Long Argument.
Lennon then started in to display his
forensic ability. He argued that the
"John Sullivan" salary warrant was Ille
gal on its face and that McGlade could
not be charged with forging an illegal
document. The grounds of L.ennon's ar
gument were that thÂ« warrant did not
comply with the law and that if the City
Auditor had known his business he would
not have been deceived by Â£uch a docu
ment. He argued that the warrant ought
to have given in detail the work it repre
sented to have been done and that it was
not sworn to before a duly authorized per
se n to administer an oath. Lennon talked
until the hour of the noon recess.
When court convened for the afternoon
the Jury was excused until this morning,
pending the arguments of the attorneys
as to admission in evidence of the "John
Sullivan" salary warrant.
Deuprey Argues for Prosecution.
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
made a lengthy argument opposing the
contentions of counsel for the defense and
cited decisions to show that the prosecu
tion had fully proved that the "John Sul
livan" salary' warrant should be allowed
in evidence. Counsel for the people quoted
decisions to show that a paper which on
Its face bore tho purport for which it was
issued was sufficient proof of intent and
calculation to defraud if the party utter
ing it knew that it was a fraudulent docu
ment. .. . .
Attorney Deuprey argued that the Penal
Code provided that if any person wrote
and uttered a paper calculated to defraud,
that person was guilty of forgery. Many
other decisions were quoted by Deuprey
to prove his side of the case.
Attorney Lennon made an argument in
reply on the same lines he had followed
out in the morning. .
Judge Melvin Gives Decision.
Judge Melvin, when the arguments were
closed, gave his decision. He said that,
though tho laws in qther States were con
flicting on the subject, the law ln- p Cali
fornia was perfectly clear. The Judge
read a number of decisions showing that
the "John Sullivan" salary warrant came
within the statute of forgery and said:
"There may be certain irregularities and
informalities in this salary warrant, but
I will rule that it "be allowed in evidence
in this case." Â¦ ,". -..â¢â¢:.
A rumor gained currency yesterday In
the Hall of Justice that two of the jurors
trying McGlade were friendly to the de
fendant and that they would hold out for
a disagreement when the jury retired to
consider its verdict. The matter was
openly boasted of In the halls of the
building. Â¦.'.;Â¦ ;. Â¦Â¦.â¢â¢-â¢; ;

afflicted more or less fora quarter of a century with catarrh of the stomach

A few bottles of your medicine have given me almost complete relief, and I
am sure that a continuation of them will offset a permanent cure. Peruna
is surely a wonderful remedy for catarrhal affections," â Â«/. D. Boikin,
Congressman-at-Large.
CONGRESSMAN BOTKIN is one of
the most Influential and best known
men In the State of Kansas. What-
ever he may say on any subject will be
accepted Â¦ by the people as the truth. So
famous a remedy as Peruna could not
have well escaped the attention of so
famous a man. He not only has heard of
the remedy, but he has used it and was
relieved of an. affliction of twenty-five
years' standing. Peruna Is the one inter-
nal remedy that-cures chronic catarrh. It
cures catarrh wherever located. This is a
fact that the people are. rapidly finding
out, but there are still a large multitude
who need to know it.
Mr. Frank Richter of Winona. Minn.,
says in a letter to The Peruna Medicine
Company:
"As a remedy for catarrh I take pleas-
ure in recommending Peruna for. catarrh
of the stomach. I know what it is to be
afflicted with this awful disease, and con-
sider It my duty to say a word in behalf
of the remedy which gave me such relief.
Peruna cured me. and I know It will cure
any one else who suffers from this dis-
ease. It gives me great pleasure to testify
to the curative effects of this medicine.
Peruna is a well tested and frequently
used remedy, and for catarrh of the stom-
ach it is unsurpassed.
"My catarrh was principally located In
my head and stomach. I tried many rem-
edies without success. I tried several doc-
tors but they were unable to cure me. I
read of Peruna in the papers, and five
bottles cured me."â Frank Richter.
The gastric juice is secreted by the mu-
cous follicles of the stomach. When this
juice is normal it digests (dissolves) the
food without producing any disturbance
whatever. If, however, the gastric juice
ia not normal. 'digestion causes many dis-
agreeable symptoms. This condition is
known as Indigestion. Peruna will cure
this. Â¦. .;: '

615 -Examiner B'ld'g S. F.Wu Ting Fang has once more risen up to say thai
theiChinese were civilized when the races now occupy
ing Europe and America: were barbarians; and now
we have to consider whether, a man can be justly con
sidered a good diplomatist when he goes about raking
up old sores in that reckless sort of way. â¢
. Dispatches from Chicago announce that a youna
man has started out to. make himself king of the coni
market and has thus far been very successful. Jus;
now, they are calling him the "Napoleon of the corn
pit," but to-morrow his name may be Dennis.
The object of his law is just as plain as the moun
tains of his State. It is not to -prevent the prosecu
tion of former polygamists by persons outside their
families. It is. to enable the church to safely resume
polygamy as a religious institution and hold those
who practice it harmless and safe from the law.
In urging such a palpable violation of its pledged
faith we assure the Mormon hierarchy that it makes
a' capital mistake.
Bad faith is odiou3 under any circumstances, and
in this breach there is no element that can tolerate
cr excuse it.
The country will be roused to indignation and an
amendment to the Federal'cohstitution will be adopted
within two years that 7 will brand Utah as leprous and
pestiferous, and leave upon her honor and the good
name of the church that rules her a stain that cannot
be washed out. . .
AS we predicted, the* Utah law which prevents
any prosecution for polygamy except on com
plaint of husband or wife is already put for
ward as similar to the adultery statutes of other
Spates.-
Senator Evans, its author, says: "My object in
presenting the bill was twofold. . In the first place it
was intended to keep down public agitation by taking
.-nvay from certain agitators *he opportunity to arouss
periodic furors against the Mormons directly, and
indirectly against the State of Utah, and for that rea
son its primary purpose was for the good of, the
State. I believe that a general act upon our statute
books in conformity with the laws of Michigan, Min
nesota, Iowa, Oregon and v North Dakota, and even
more liberal laws, would create much less agitation
throughout the country than the practice which has
heretofore been resorted- to of arresting every few
weeks some Mormon, on a charge of unlawful co
habitation and having the arrest announced in flam
ing headlines by all the newspapers throughout the
country which can be induced to take up an anti-
Mormon crusade. Everybody knows that these ar
rests have been made for political and religious pur
poses and not with any patriotic desire to* enforce the
law." t
It is quite interesting that any man can be as blind
as the Senator pretends to 'be. Â¦*
TME MORMON IDEfl.
MARYLAND'S ELECTION LflW.
GORMAN'S. ambition to regain powjer in Mary
land has led the Democratic majority in the
Legislature of that State to enact an election
law which has revived public interest in the suppres
sion of the negro vote in the Southern States, and
may probably raise it to the position of an important
if not the chief issue in our politics until redress has
been obtained. The Maryland law is cunningly de
vised. It is apparently a frank adoption of the Austra
lian ballot pure and simple, but it really provides a
system of voting that cannot be used by the illiterate
voter unless he should, receive assistance from the.
election officers, and it has been stated that the pro-,
visions of the law regulating the selection of those
officers are such as to enable the Democratic machine
to entirely control the elections and virtually dictate
the result.
The Baltimore American says there are 26,000 col
ored illiterates in Maryland, most of whom are Re
publicans, and 18,000 white illiterates, most of whom
are Democrats. Thus if all should be excluded, and
no trickery resorted to, the Republicans would still
sustain a much heavier loss in voting strength than
the Democrats. That fact and its significance are so
well understood it is taken as a foregone, conclusion
that Got man can be re-elected to the Seriate if he de
sires. In fact, the Democrats have apparently cap
tured the State, and :hey have effected it by a cun
ning method of disfranchising the colored vote.
There is one ray of light in the situation. The Re
publican leaders are busily engaged in urging the
negroes to learn how to read so that they will be able
to vote notwithstanding the Democratic scheme. In
commenting upon that phase of the issue the Ameri
can says: "The colored illiterates are eager to learn
to read and to distinguish the names on the ballots,
nor have they, for the sake of receiving instruction,
any hesitancy in coming forward and confessing their
illiteracy. The case with the white illiterates is en
tirely different. New as is 'this agitation, it has been
already demonstrated that the whites resent the im
position of an educational qualification, and that they
wilf lose their votes rather than confess their inability
to properly distinguish the names" on the ballots. In
view of this.it is indisputable that, while striving for
a mean partisan advantage; the Democrats are daily
shaping the proposed new election law after the man
ner of a boomerang, which in the end- will turn and
strike them that _ threw it."
Should the law have the effect thus suggested it
would be one more instance, of good resulting from
evil. In the meantime it is to be noted that the sub
ject has aroused the nttention of earnest men who be
licvc that the suppression of the colored vote by the
Democrats has been carried too far. According to re
ports from Washington : "Leading Republican mem
bers of Congresssay that at its next session Congress
cannot refuse to ignore this wholesale denial of the right
of suffrage to men who are entitled to it under the
, Federal constitution, and that a bill will be pressed for
RESULTS OF VOTING MACHINES.
SHORTLY after the Presidential election last fall
The Call directed attention to reports from dif
ferent cities concerning the results obtained
i'cm balloting machines. Since that time the reÂ«
ports have been more carefully studied and the net re-j
suits of machine voting more accurately determined.
The conclusions which have been published in the
March number of the "Annals of the American
Academy"' amply sustain the advocates of the nevv
system of voting and confirm almost everything that
lias been said in favor of the machines.
From the summary given in the "Annals" it ap
pears that in New York State alone 277 machines were
r:-ed in twenty-five different cities, including Buffalo,
a city of sufficient population to put the mechanism
iind the system to a thorough test. In that city the
Â¦voting went on in the different wards at rates vary
ing from 80 to 150 votes an hour. There was" no
breakdown, hitch or trouble with the machines. In
oi:c instance where time was kept it was noted that
nirie men voteH within two minutes, and two of them
c'tclared they had spiit their tickets. In eleven of the
voting districts of the city over 800 names were on
the register, and jet so swiftly did the machines per
mit voting to be carried on that not only did every
Jiisn have ample time to vote, but there were por
t-ions of the day when the machines were idle. Out
cf a total vote of 66,Coo upward of 70 per cent had
voted by noon.
A notable feature of the system is the quickness
with which the returns were obtained. The report of
the voting at Buffalo sa\-s: "The polls closed at 5
p. m., and shortly before that time a swift bicycle
rider reported at every polling place with a label on
hÂ«s wheel which gave him right of wax over every
thing on the street and permission to make his utmost
speed. In less than five minutes after the polls close 1
full reports from every district were on their way to
the City Hall. * * * The results in all places
where voting machines were used were placed at once
en the wires of the Associated Press and the Bell
Telephone Company and were communicated to both
Presidential candidates before 6 p. m." To show the
advantage of the machine by contrast with the old
system the report states that in 1896 it took eight
hours and thirty minutes to finish and file the returns
from! Buffalo.
â¢ Speed, however, is not the only good result -from
the machines. It was proven that with the machine
it is just as easy to split a ticket as to vote it straight
snd in general the splitting was done much more
accurately than in voting the Australian ballot under
ihe old plan. Thus by the reports from Northampton,
Mass., where seven machines were used, averaging
4>) voters to the machine, it was found that the num
ber of blank votes was decreased at least 50 per cent
ns compared with thotc of 1806.
At Ithcxa, N. Y., where 2800 votes were polled, the
citv clerk estimates that the machine saves the city
UTnvard of $500 a year in printing expenses and the
salaries of election officers. It is noted, moreover,
that the result of the vote in that city at the last elec
tion was known accurately within fifteen minutes after
the polls closed.
.Speaking of the subject generally the report says
of the machine system: "It is fair, rapid, accurate,
ccoromica! and as nearly fraud-proof as it is possible
:Â«.r any human device to be. The first and absolutely
necessary step in all referm is to make sure that every
election is an honest oneâ is a real expression of the
people's will â and this the voting machine docs with
"<>::t any uncertainty whatever. * * * The name
oi ever)' candidate nominated appears plainly before
tiie eye of the voter, where he cannot help seeing it,
s^d all candidates are on exactly the same footing,
because it is just as eisy to move one indicator as
Finally, it is to be noted that the use of the ma
chines will be largely increased in the next elections.

CALIFOBNIANS IN NEW YOEK.
pijROM the office of "The Indian Rights Associa-
I tion," at Philadelphia, there has been issued a
pamphlet on the condition of "*the Mission
Indians of Southern California which presents a strik
ing array of evidence of wrongs committed against
the Indians and makes a strong plea for justice. '
The pamphlet was written by Constance Goddard
DuBcis, and contains extracts from reports, on the
conditions of the Indians by Helen Hunt Jackson and
Abbot Kinney, special commissioners of the Govern
ment: Mr. Estudillo," at" one time the Government
representative at the o gency; Father Ubach and Rev.
H. B. Restarick of San Diego and Rev. Joseph H.
Johnson of Los Angeles. All of the reports agree
that the Indians have. been badly treated; that their
condition is deplorable through no fault of their own.
and that immediate relief should be given by the Gov
ernment.
It appears from the reports that' much of the land
in the reservations set apart for the Mission Indians
is utterly barren, and that the whites have been con
tinually encroaching upon whatever portions of the
reservations as are worth having. It is said the reser
vation at Capitan Grande is "mostly made up of the
steep, bare sides of the mountain walls of the canyon,
and Father Ubach is quoted as saying "Capitan
Grande is a disgrace."
It is pointed out thaMvith the Mission Indians we
do not have to combat the habit of nomadic exist
ence. They were partially civilized long ago by
the efforts of the Spanish friars, who taught them not
only religion but the practice of industry and thrift:
Their very pe^ceableness, however, appears to be
against them, .for Bishop Johnson is reported as de
claring: Â¦ : "If they 'were bloodthirsty savages the Gov
ernment would, probably provide them with . ample
rations and other things needfuLto keep them from
going on the' Warpath; but little is being done for
these peaceful wards of the nation, who are in every
way more deserving than the sa\Â»age tribes who have
received so much of the nation's' bounty."
In addition to the evils caused by the neglect of the
Government, it is alleged; that further wrongs have
resulted ifrom the 'aggressions of the whites and that
the condition of the Indians has now become so acute
that unless steps.be iriimediately taken by the Govern
ment to' protect the reservations the Indians will be
driven off their lands altogether, as if. they were "no
more than herds'' of wild deer to be driven back iii
advance of the white man."
- Charges of -soVgrave ;a\riature/. resting -upon' such
good authority, are not to bejgriored, and it i's to be
hored the attention of thV 'Government will soon" be
directed to the wrong. California wishes more whits
settlers and has a ready welcome for all who come, but
she is not so lacking in untilled land nor so unjust as
to drive a few poor Indians from their homes in order
to make way for the new-comers. The Spanish friars
of the old days were poor and weak, while the United
States Government is rich and strong, and surely
then, since the friars did so much for the improvement
of the Indians, the United States might at least main
tain what was done for them, and not, through re
peated wrongs, drive them to resort to savagery as
the only alternative. to starvation.

REST FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN.
It is to be hoped the bill, passed by the Legislature
to. put an end to home study will be approved by the
Governor. If he ever had any doubts about its wis
dem they can hardly remain after the reports of the
tests made in this city.
In this work of improvement much has been done
tc care for the body as well as the mind of the child,
ami everything wisely done in that direction : has
proven about as beneficial to the brain as to
the muscle. The new movement toward ridding the
pupil of ijhe task of home study is in the same direc
tion. It tends to give the child more hours of recrea
tion, and the result has been brighter minds and more
willing hearts when "ihey return to school.
Up to this time our system of education has hardly
passed the experimental stage.. It began with a prac
tice of teaching a child little more than reading, writ
ing and arithmetic in schoolhouses that were bare,
ill-ventilated, frequently ill-lighted, and in many ways
not only uncomfortable but actually prejudicial; to
health. With the advance of education, howeyer, the
public schools system taught schoolteachers and
parents about astnuch as it taught children. One re
form after another has been brought about, until now
public school education is so different from what it
was a generation ago that oldnime teachers would
hardly recognize it as the outgrowth of their work.
The San Francisco tests justify the action of those
who sought to bring about the enactment of a State
law forbidding home study to be imposed upon the
children of any of our public schools. The issue is
one of no little importance. It concerns every horns
in which there is any child in attendance upon the
schools, for it means the relief of childhood from one
of the onerous burdens imposed upon it by our sys
tem of education, and cannot fail to be felt beneficially
by all whom it affects.
It is announced that the Board of Education has
been so* well satisfied with the results obtained from
the tests that it will have the experiments continuc-1
and made upon a more comprehensive, scale. It Can
hardly be doubted the new tests will be as favorable
as those already made, and that within a comparatively
short time it will have been demonstrated to the sat
isfaction of even the most conservative teachers that
home work is not a necessity for. pupils in our public
scnools, and that the children may be left free to em
ploy their hours at home in something other than
school work. -
The schools in which the tests were made are the
Horace Mann, the Broadway and the Hearst. I From
every one of them good reports came in. James H.
Simmons of the Horace Mann School reported
making a careful comparison of the work achieved by
the class from which no home study was required
with that of other classes, and added: "I confess
that I am surprised to find that the 'no home study'
class holds its own with the rest. I have watched the
work closely, and the examinations were carefully
prepared and conducted., I desirq to continue the ex
periment further." From the Broadway Grammar
School there came a joint report signed by several
teachers declaring: "The work of the no home study
section has equaled in"every respect that of the home
study sections." The add that in their judg
ment pupils should do the greater part of their work
within school hours. N. A. Wood of the Hearst
Grammar School reported that the percentages of the
pupils not required to study at home were as high
or higher than they had been when home work wa3
imposed. He added that in addition to the good, re
sults shown in the lessons there was also an improve
ment in the deportment of the pupils under the new
system. , â¢ .
REPORTS submitted to the Board of Education
on Tuesday concerning the results of tests
made of school classes relieved of the task of
studying at home are so jj favorable t6 the reform
movement that it is now reasonable to expect^, the
practice of requiring .school-children to study at home
as well as in the schools will be abolished.

Senate may cost his party dear..^r':
by their maladies. They have learned to
work in a more orderly and systematic
manner, and above all to seek rest and
change when they are required.
How Patients Lose Their Chances
One great trouble with patients suffer
ing from such chronic diseases is that
they live in an atmosphere of unrest as
regards treatment; they are not willing tj
leave either themselves or their disease*
alone. They must always be up and .do
ing, in many cases the truth being that
the more they do the more rapidly they
decline. They go from place to place;
they grasp at every straw of relief of
fered by the wise, the ignorant, or the
unscrupulous, and thereby sometimes Ioaa
the few chances that are left to them.
They should not say .o the doctor. "Can
you cure me?" but, "What can you do
to relieve my sufferings, improve my
health and prolong my life?" It is not
necessary for such patients always to
give up the work in which thev are in
gaged, but it is always necessary that
they do this work under the requirements
of the 'new situation. How and when to
rest are for them always among the most
Important things to learn. I have known
not a few such patients to be hastened to
their graves by trying methods of treat
ment which involve exercise of an un
suitable or even violent character. Exer
cise has a great place even in the treat
ment of some organic diseases, but im
properly directed It may add to the ills
of the patient, and hasten processes of
decay and degeneration. Some well ad
vised apostles of exercise travel from city
to city and gather In the weak, the halt,
and the depressed, and preaching a ser
mon which is applicable to a few, alluri
the many Into a routine of therapeutic
overwork which can only prove disas
trous.
Avoid TJnrest â Get Proper Rest
Combining BÂ»st With Work
The problems included under a discus
sion of rest as the concerver of health
and prolonger of life may be preserted
from two practical standpoints; first, the
avoidance of hnbits of unrest, and sec
ond, the best method of obtaining the
rest that is required. Much space need
not be taken up with a consideration of
the first of these heads. Not a few of
those who suffer from nervous or other
breakdown do fo because their Iive3 and
work are full of unrest. .Of two business
men who have equal amounts of work to
do and are practically equal in physical
strength and mental capacity, one goes
about his task with a system and steadi
ness that do not wear either upon himself
or those with v.'hom he comes in contact,
the other with such restlessness and nn
necessary output as to keep himself iu a
half-exnausted state and those around
him disturbed and disquieted. Perhaps
his unrest is shown in the unnecessary
steps which he takes or the unnecessary
rapidity with which he takes them; In
talking too long or x too excitedly; in driv
ing when leading would do betterâ in
brief, in expending more energy than is
necessary even for the full accomplish
ment of the work In hand. The feelings
of those compelled by fate to keep com
pany with these useful but irritating mor
tals are best expressed by the slang ex
pression, "Give us a rest"; but as a rule
they never either .rest themselves nor let
any one about ihem rest. One set of men
do their work with smoothness and with
only that lossr of vitality which is easily
repaired by their dally income of food and
sleep; the other Is always giving out more
than can be thus supplied. One saves his
forces at the same time that he uses
them; the other is wasting much that he
might easily save. One physician is worn
out before his hours of work have half
expired; the other goes evenly and quiet
ly through the hard day's work. The work
that nags and harasses one man scarcely
ruffles the other.
Much of this is due to the fact that
many, perhaps most, men have no*
learned to conserve their forces while at
work; to combine rest with work, or at
least work without unnecessary restless
ness. Often much could be done to pre
vent breakdown by simply seizing the lit
tie opportunities which either offer or
can be made, to rest body and mini,
either while at labor or during the inter
vals which come in so many forms of
labor. Men stand or move about at the>r
work, when they could just as readily
sit. Sometimes both men and women are
forced by the rules of an establishment
to waste their energies standing and walk
ing when they might be saved by glvlnz
opportunities to rest when standing and
walking are not required by the exigen
cies of business. Stools without backs
and desks of Improper shape or. size some
times add to the labor, and prevent rest
which even during labor might be easily
had.
In the foolish haste which governs so
mary, even the quickly eaten meal of the
business man is not taken with thÂ« qu Â«t
and rest which could be obtained. He sits
on a high and unbacked stool at a counter
with an empty chair and table within
reach, apparently fearful lest he may be
tempted by a little more comfort to pro
long the time snatched from his business.
Banish the Spirit of Unrest.
Much of the work that is done In this
struggling world must be done in haste
and with energy, or the results wished for
will not be obtained: but while this Is
true, it is also true that often more haste
if taken and more energy expended than
Is called for by necessity. The spirit of
unrest dominates too much.
How Is rest to be secured? This ques
tion cannot be answered. by merely gen
eral statements. The individual must be
studied even more than the disease. The
rest which is one man's meat may be an
other's poison. Rest, especially for those
stricken or threatened with nervous dis
ease, is to be obtained- through daily peri
ods of rest and recreation, through sea
sonal vacations or holidays, through
travel and change of climate, through
well selected reading and diversion, and
through methods of rest treatment.

How Rest Prolongs Life.
The neurasthenic, like Serenus in his
letter to Seneca, finds himself "In a state
of mind which; although not the worst, is
particularly complaining and sullen." "I
am neither sick nor well," he says. And
yet he is sick, but fortunately it may be.
only for a season, if he seeks and obtains
the rest which he requires.
A' well-known clergyman, in an even
better-known religious journal, recently
delivered himself of the opinion that there
Is no such thing as nervous prostration,
denning the condition which Is called by
this name by saying that it is "simply ii
lack of will power, a sinking into imagi-i
ation which plays havoc with religion an<{
usefulness." The clergyman is not alom
in this opinion, for not a few otherwise
well-informed physicians hold the same
view. They seem to believe that neura-?
thenia is a good label with which to ex
cuse a man for his shortcomings, or to
procure for him a holiday; or perhaps be
cause hysteria and melancholia are so
often associated with neurasthenia, or
neurasthenia is so often the soil from
which melancholia and hysteria develop,
the affection is* not regarded as worthy
of a separate habitation and name. I be
lieve, however, that there is a more or
less serious functional nervous disorder
which in its pure type should be des'g
nated neurasthenia or nervous prostration,
and for this affection rest Is the best rem
edy/although other measures may prove
useful adjuvants.
Rest properly taken does much to pro
long and make- comfortable the lives not
only of those suffering from functional
diseases of the nervous system, but for
a considerable percentage of those who
are afflicted with organic and often In
curable disease. It- is rest on which wo
must most rely for the relief of that pre
eminently American disease, neurasthenia
or nervous exhaustion.
The> doctor who deals with the over
worked and underrested has always a
serious problem presented to him. A man
comes to him with a story of falling pow
ers of attention, of irritable temper, of
confusion of ideas, of a feeling of feeble
ness, of rain or discomfort in the head or
spine, of restlessness by day and sleep
lessness by night, and asks for advice that
will bring relief; a woman comes with a
story of undue emotionality, of mental de
pression, of interference with normal
functions, of weariness and hopelessness â
with many of the symptoms of the man,
and where these are wanting with others
of her own to make up the lack; the child
or youth is brought with a story of bad
conduct, of ehoreic twitchings, of loss of
interest in school work, of failing strength
and often of special disorders of diges
tion or excretion. In most of these cases
what la most needed is rest. The value
and virtue of rest should be made as
much the object of the earnest physi
cian's study as drugs and waters, Instru
ments 'and commonly accepted methods
of treatment.
Rest. as a Cure for Organic Disease.
Underrest is often as 'great an. evil as
overwork. To say that a man is over
worked is not exactly the same as to say
that he is underrested. Some of those
who work hard do not in reality over
work, but they do not know how to rest,
even though the time and opportunity to
rest are at their disposal. They have
spent so much time in learning how to
work and in working that they know
nothing- else. This is true of men in all
walks of life, but especially of business
and professional men, some of whom still
further dissipate their energies in their
efforts to recuperate.
Underrest and Overwork.
< Honest labor, physical or mental, should
not impair health nor shorten life. The
man who works with his brain, if well
equipped, should stand longer hours than
those usually forced upon the average
mechanic, provided food and rest are
properly supplied. The word rest as here
used covers not only simple repose or in
action of body and mind, but reaction and
sleep.- It is not work which maims or
kills, but overwork, ill-regulated work
and work out of season.
The word rest in some languages means
a. measure of distance, a mile, for in
stance; in one of Its ancient forms It con
tains the idea of rejoicing or pleasure.
When the doctor advises rest to his over
worked or overworried patient, if his ad
vice- is of practical worth it will Include
suggestions and directions as to the meth
ods of measuring both work and rest, and
of adding to that rest such recreation as
is most suitable to the patient's, needa.
Simply to tell a sick man that he must
rest, without showing him the best way
of 'doing this, will.usiially.be of little ser
vice. Sometimes, indeed, the effort to rest
becomes itself a task, or what is rest for
one man may be a task for another.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY; MARCH Â«JR, 1901.

Rest serves a great purpose In preserv
ing the usefulness and prolonging the lives
even of those who are stricken with In
curable maladies, -but 'maladies which do
not necessarily soon threaten death. It is
well worth while to lay stress upon this
phase of the subject. Many a man through
inheritance, misfortune or fault has be
come the victim of an organic disease of
t,he nervous system or of some other part
of the body, a disease which cannot be
cured and which -tills him with dread an-1
despair â¢when once he has become aware
of Its presence. Such a one should not say
to himself: "I am sick and cannot' cei
well, therefore I rosy as well give up and
wait for the end" â but just as the healthy
man should study his limitations, jo
should the sick man study his. His In
quiry should be directed to determine how
he can make himself or keep himself most
' useful,' notwithstanding the illness Â¦with
which he is afflicted. I have sometimes
said that I feel inclined to advise life in
surance companies to risk endowment
! policies of ten or fifteen years on - many
, cas>ess of chronic disease of the nerves,
spinal cord and brain, with the same con
fidence that they "would on those in good
health, with the proviso that such pa
: tients be Instructed and agree to follow a
course of life to be prescribed for them.
Many a case of locomqtor ataxia, of pa
j ralysis from neutritls or clot, of diabetes.
I or of Bright's disease has almost as good
a chance of ten to twenty years of life
and a large degree of usefulness as his
healthy neighbor has of twenty to thirty
years; Like the man growing old. what
he needs to do Is tc change his plane of
activity. Drugs and other well chosen
; methods. of treatment will do something,
for him, but more can be. done by rest"
and change in mode of life.
Combating Serious Diseases.
The story is told of a man suffering:
from looomotor ataxia who was steadily
and rapidry getting worse, but who by
I what seemed an ill stroke, of fortune,
1 broke his leg- and was compelled to take
: to hi3 bed for several months. On rising
! after the bone had knit it was found that
he had' made more improvement in the
painful and crippling symptoms of his dis
ease than , he had done under much pre
vious treatment. Facts like this In con
nection with the teachings* of physiology
have shown that rest properly directed i3
one of the best therapeutic measures in
the treatment of this disease. The pa
tients suffering from ataxia' and from sim
ilar deeeneratlve diseases of the nervous
system who are collected together in hos
pitals for chronic nervous maladies, like
the wards ' for nervou3 diseases of s the
Philadelphia jj hospital, or the world-fa
mous .wards, of the Salpetriere of Paris

and hygiene I know of patients suffering
from diabetes who havev made more than
one fortune after they have been doomed
to dieby foot-in-the-grave doctors, and
after they, have: been refused short en
dowment policies In careful life insurance

Other witnesses testified that they were
placed in the Asiatic steerage on the same
deck with Chinese and Japanese -and sep
arated by a piece of canvas, and that only
six wash basins were provided, for the
124 men. '
G.. Dewitt. a butcher, and one/ of the
plaintiffs,- testified that while tfie chief
butcher of tho Rio was sick he 'acted as
assistant butcher.- The fresh meat was so
much tainted, he said, that he cut the
tainted pieces off and threw them over
board. The meat -next to the edges was
ill-smelling and unwholesome, but he cut
It up for the steerage passengers and kept
the best for the cabin passengers.
The trial will be resumed this morning. ,
One of the plaintiffs. Frank Sullivan,
testified that the food was good for the
first three .or four days out from Naga
saki, but that after that time it was bad.
He tried to eat it but It turned'hls stom
ach and he rejected It with loathing. The
xabbage soup was vile, because of the for
eign substances it contained. The odor of
the meat while It" was being cooked was
enough for him, he said. During the rest
of the voyage he- lived principally on
beans and water. Thebutter tasted Ilka

rank to eat.
It was the second day of the trial of the

others,, brown-raced and ruddy from ex
posure lo the open air, were divided be
tween the court room and the corridor.
They were called in, one by one, by their
counsel, Rlordan and Lunde, and poured
their stories into the. attentive ear of
Judge de Haven. *
They were a unit as to their testimony,
which, boiled down, was to the effect that
from the time the Rio de Janeiro was
three days out from Nagasaki and from
that time until they arrived in San Fran
cisco they were fed on tainted meat, bad
Boup and tea and coffee that had evidently
been scooped up out- of a swamp, if tho

"Water Front Notes.
Captain Dodd of the bark Vidette re
ports the following: additional details re
gardingr'the derelict sighted by him oft
Point Concepcion on the 12th InsL: There
was no loose wreckage or any sign of
masts or housesâ It Etood on end nearly,
and, so far as the captain could judge,
about one-sixth of the vessel was out or
water; Inside of bulwarks were paneled
and rainted white, varied with a darn
color, probably green or brown; the top
rail seemed heavy and solid and was of a
dark color; the white paint appeared to
have been in the water but a short time;
the outside was painted a dark color.
The rudder was still intact. The captain
thinks the vessel was of about 500 tons.
The inside painting appeared to be some
what fancy and the bulwarks low, with
heavy rail and half circle.
Mora About a Derelict.
Powell-street -wharf was let to the City
Street Improvement Company for $4922.
Informal bids for repairing the damage
dono by the ferry steamer Berkeley to

Some time ago the ballast men asked for
a reduction on the 5 cents a ton charged
them when ballastinpr a ship. On the rec
ommendation of Chief Wharfinger Hen
derson the request was refused. The
board then decided that in future crushed
rock should be assessed 5 cents Instead
cf 2*i cents a ton as heretofore.

Boston Wool Market. I
BOSTON. March 27. â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The wool market has increased In activity
the past week and a large volume of business
has been transacted, notably in Territories.
Australian and English and Irish wools and
large lines of both domestic and foreign wools
are under negotiation. One house is reported
to have cleaned out practically, all of Its Ter
ritories, amounting to a million and a half
pounds, and these 'wools sold at prices raging
all the way from 38 to 45 cents clean. We fig
ure the eales for the week at close to 7,000,000
pounds. There have been purchases of wool
not only by consumers but also by dealers on
speculation. Among the consumers who have
been buying wools the dress goods mills have
been conspicuous. They have purchased Ter
ritories freely. Duplicate orders for light
weights have continued to come In. and mak
ers of these lines have bought fair amounts of
Â¦wool. The market is no stronger than it was
and any attempt to advance actual prices on
the part of holders beyond the level quoted last
week results in checking business. The sales
for the week In Boston amounted to 6.022.000
pounds domestic and 975,000 pounds foreign
making a total of 6.997,000 pounds against a
total of 5.6S5.000 for the previous week, and a
total of 3,012,000 for the corresponding week
last year. The sales since January l amount
to 63.641,900 pounds against 41.015.000 pounds for
the corresponding time last year.
London Wool Sales.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK. March 27.â The movement of
today's stock market was confusing and lr
lee-jlar to the laFt degree. The dealings were
liljrhly professional and there seemed to b* a
â¢ cntPM waging between a bull following and
â¢ bear following, each side commanding the
frvl"-^ of tome of the oldest and mo6t skill
ful jTofÂ«>Fional operators in the utreet. While
t-u<-h *a; the current belief among room
traders and the outside speculative contingent
whether the bulls were all really bulls or the
hrars really desired to see lower prices it
Â¦"â¢u'd lw> very difficult to say. A market of
Furh a character Is distinguished by the wari
npss an4 the skillful ruses employed by the
â¢Â¦'poratur*. For instance, experience shows that
ncthln? will caut< such eager support by large
buying orders for the account of the friends
of a stock as the knowledge of a bear raid
Hcair.st it. ThiÂ« cave rise to the suspicion that

Trrtl hurl bear brokers to Fell out and realize
profit* in order to give the impression that
the falling v.aÂ« for the short account. The
markrt opened with the influence of last night's
upward rueh Filll man'.fest. but the selling to
take profits caused a 0-;cllne to Fet In almost
immediately, which iorce<l priests very gen
ora!!y below last nlphfs level. In Burlington
and Northern Pacific the profit-taking was
especially heavy owing to the meager details
which accompanied thr allegations that an
ajn-cemT-t had been reached for th<Â» absorption
of the Rurlinfrton by tho Hill-Morgan inter
an export of gold to France also had a de
jre>Fing influence. Tl:e announcement gave
ground for the usual wrangle among exchange
fxiiertK up to whether the movement was a
*r*erial Tif or a regular exchange operation.
The e*n*riil filing is that it 1b the prelude
to' a regular nut ward movement of gold. Itank
rrs proffered to have no fear that such a
movement w)!l affect thÂ» monej- market un
favrrably. The feeling ->t depression was prac
tically nvercnme during the first hour and
ouring the re*Â»t of the ilay there was a succes

froi.i n fractlnn to 2 points. Practically each

CHICAGO, March 27.â Trade in corn was act
ive the greater part of the session, but the
volume of business was smaller than has been
the average recently. The market, however,
showed a resumption of the advancing ten
dency which received something of a check yes
terday. Profit-taking was still against the
price, but the pressure was reduced. Higher
cables, light country offerings, almost Impass
able roads and unsettled weather were the bull
factor*. May opened a ehade to US'Hc higher,
42*. 4 iH42'4c, advanced to 42%<g42 :t ic. reacted to
42Va42 I <je, closing firm, 'iÂ®Â»ic higher, at 42%c.
Activity of short duration at the beginning
of the session and again near the end Is the
best that can be said of the day's wheat trade.
But despite this dullness, which at times â¢ be
came stagnation, the market exhibited a firm
undertone. Selling May and replacing lt with
July formed a considerable part of the day's*
operations. The firmness early was a result of
steady cables, moderate receipts and unsettled
weather, together with the corn strength. May
opened unchanged to Uc higher, at 73V40!
7i>Hc to 75%c and declined early on selling
through brokers to 7S^iig75M.c. The corn
strength, renewed alarm over strained relations
between Japan and Russia and somewhat
alarming Southwestern reports of damage from
Hessian fly caused a rally hear the end. Shorts
covered liberally and May rallied sharply to
76c and closed firm, *ic over yesterday, at 7574

THE LATE JOHN ALLMAN, VETERAN STAGE OWNER, WHO DISAP
PEARED FROM HIS OAKLAND HOME ON THURSDAY AND WHOSE
BODY WAS FOUND IN THE ESTUARY.
Frank Dalton and his brother had been
watching the working up of a lot of iron
in the furnaces. When they tried to stop
the flow of the Iron some cold water that
was being used fell upon the running mass
of metal and the explosion followed in
stantly.
After the men\gathered themselves to
gether they found that beyond the inju
ries to themselves no damage had re
sulted. Only a sufficient quantity of gas
had been generated to affect the two
brothers, who were near the cupola. .^U
While trying tÂ« check the flow of molten
metal from a cupola at their foundry in
West Oakland last evening County As
sessor Henry P. Dalton and his brother,
Frank N. Dalton, were injured in an ex
plosion of gas formed by contact of water
with the superheated mass.
Both men were knocked down and more
or less seriously burned by the explosion.
Frank Dalton's face, neck and eyes were
most seriously injured. The Assessor's
side and arm were ceared, but not so
badly that he was compelled to remain
at home. Frank Dalton is confined to
his residence. This afternoon it was an
nounced that he will not suffer permanent
injury. .

CAUSES BURNING
DENVER. Colo.. March 27.â A bailiffs
promptness and a magistrate's coolness
probably averted a tragedy during the
preliminary hearing ol Albert Cowan to
day on the charge ol killing Mrs. Short,
one of the last thro- victims of the Cap
itol Hill "sluRger."
Albert Fredericks, an Arab, the prin
cipal witness agaii'.ft Cowan, leveled a
pistol at the prisoner's attorney. Fred
ericks had just declared that he had seen
Cowan strike the fatal blow.
"That's the man who killed Mrs. Short,"
cried Attorney Rees addressing Albert
Fredericks. Fredericks lost his temper,
snatched up Cowan's revolver which was
lying on a table la front of him and
threatened Attorney Rees. A constable
rushed forward and snatching the weapon
from his hand forced Fredericks into his
seat.
"If there is any shooting going on here,"
gaid Attorney Rees. "1 guess 1 had better
be the man with the gun, aa I am
smaller."
A? he said this the attorney stepped for
ward es though to reach for the pistol
and Fredericks made a second jump at it,
but Justice Rice took the weapon and the
witness sank back in his seat.

IN COURTROOM
Mr. Cleveland at the outset spoke of the
vagueness* on the subject of boundary
line? in the establishment both of the
Venezuelan republic and of British
Ouiana. He said that from the first ther.?
was evident need of "extraneous ass'si
ancc" before bounds sc loosely named
could be exactly fixed. He then referred
to the initiation of the dispute in 1SU be
tween the Venezuelan Minister of Great
Hritain and Lord Aberdeen, chief Secre
tary of State for Foreign Affairs. Tlie
inaklng of the Sehomburgk survey and its
bearing upon the dispute were fully ex
plained.
The lecturer, quoting constantly from
documents, showed the repeated appeal-*
cf Venezuela to Great Britain in favor of
settling the question by arbitration on the
whole subiect. declaring that their con
stitution prevented them from making 1
KTants of territory cxecpr by process, the
result of arbitration. Meantime England
constantly refused arbitration on the gen
eral subject, declaring that it feared the
Venezuelan constitution would still b<
u?Â«?d as a pretext for a disobedience to an
award. Great Britain aJt=o objected to tne
arbitration requested by Venezuela, fear
ing that an award mient l>e made in favor
of the Venezuelan claims, in which ewe
â¢â¢a-n imjx.rtant territory which has for a
k\ng period been inhabited and occupied
by her Majesty's subject?* and treated as
part of the colony ol British Guiapi
would be severed from the Queen's do
minions." On this Mr. Cleveland said:
"England a'.one had treated it as part
nf British Guiana: her immense power
had enabled her to do this and her own
decrees seemed to oromlse greater ad
vantages a.* against hei weak adversary
Than arbitration could rxissiblv assure
The British Government at one time of
fered a Dlan of arbitraV.on which did not
oovcr the entire disputed territory, but
never conscntpcl to .trbitration such as
proposed by Venezuela and which wouli
include th'e "entire territory in dispute. The

"This is a judicial body," said he. "and
Judge Hart can't enjoin us in this way
unless he upsets the constitution. I have
consulted one of the leading lawyers in
this city about my duty In this matter
and he telhj me that the constitution di
rects this Council to fix the water rates.
Now if it is contempt of court to obey
the constitution. I am ready to risk it. I
believe it is our duty to adopt this reso
lution. Then. If the water " company
don't like it they will have a fine chance
to bring another suit against the city."
The Council paid no heed to Girard's
appeal and adjourned without taking ac
tion upon the resolution.
The committee of the whole then ad
}ournÂ«*d and immediately reconvened as
the Council and took up the measure for
final action. The other members of the
Council were unwilling to commit them
selves, but Glrard was uncompromisingly
in favor of passing the resolution.
The resolution to re-enact the wa*er
rates of last year AÂ»-a3 offered last night
by Councilman Mott. Attorney A. A.
Moore, for the water company, warned the
Council that they would be in, conttiapt
if they took action on the matter contrary
to the order of the court. Tho resolution
was (inally referred to- the Fire and Wa
ter Committee for further consideration.
The committee referred ic to the commit
tee of the whole. As such the Council met
to-night in executive session. After pro
longed debate in the committee the reso
lution was referred to the Council with
out recommendation.
With this remark Councilman Glrard
closed a speech in the Council to-night
defying Judge Hart's order restraining
the Cour.cU from passing a water rate or
dinance.
"I am willing to go to jail and pay a
$500 fine. I am ready io vote for th!Â»
water rate ordinance risht now and if I
am guilty of contempt d court let Judge
Hart punish me."

Traffic on Third Street.
The eyes of the mining men are now
directed toward the appointment of a
State Mineralogist Â¦ to ..succeed -A. _- : S.
Cooper, the incumbent. The opinion is
general 'that the "appointment will be "made
spon by the Governor and . may be an
nounced any day. Mr. Cooper does not
expect to remain and has already rented
offices Â¦ elsewhere in anticipation of the
early termination of his services to the
State. The ; two names that are most
prominently mentioned in connection with
the succession are those of Lew Aubury
and W. L. Watts. Mr. Aubury lives in
Los Angeles. Mr. Watts also- claims that
place as his residence, although he has
passed much of his time in this city dur
ing the last few years,- having been con
nected for nine years with the State Min
ing Bureau as a field, deputy. -He has
been better known, during the last year
because of his work in \connection with
the oil fields of , the State, having writ
ten several bulletins concerning the oil
Industry. Â¦ â¢ \ â¢ Â«
Mr. Aubury has been engaged In mining
for some years in several States, including
California, Arizona and New Mexico. He
is a member of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers and also a member of
the California Miners' Association.'' There
are no names much heard in connection
with the succession excepting these two.
In the Mining Bureau' a strict neutrality
Is maintained in the expression of opin
ion concerning the chances of the two men
to be preferred. There has-been consid
erable friction between the State. Min
eralogist and the Governor concerning
the appointment of field deputies and the
Governor is not likely to confer with any
one connected with the bureau concern
ing the appointment. At- one time the
opinion of mining men seemed to be that
Watts had the lead, but within the last
few days the pendulum seemed to be
swinging toward Aubury. State Mineralo
gist Cooper declines to express any opin
ion concerning the succession.
â¢ "It is none of my business," he said
when he was asked about it. "No changes
in the office and museum staff of the
bureau art expected, but the Governor
may continue to appoint the field deputies
under the new administration."

TWO CANDIDATES

If the directors refuse' the offer, and J
heretofore they have been opposed to j
passing control, the success of any effort
to lease the Burlington to a Northwestern
road will be jeopardized. While New-
York banking interests have become
heavy holders of the shares, the stock Is
widely distributed throughout New Eng
lna'i, and it will be difficult to Induce
these irvestors to part' with their hold
ings. The average holdings of Burling
ton's stock is said to have been about
seventy shares, largely in New England.
It may be said that President Hill has a
strong following in New England and Is
In a better, position than almost any in

NEW YORK, March 27.-The Evening '
Post says: \ Burlington and Northern Pa
cific shares were strong and active \ to
day on- the revival of the reports that
there would be a lease of the Burlington
by the Northern Pacific and Great North- .
ern railways.* No official confirmation of:
these reports covfld be obtained to-day, j
and important stockholding interests in '
the Burlington denied having information
that any offer bad been made for the :
Burlington here.
It may be said that neither- the Great \
Northern nor the Northern Pacific direc
tors have considered such a lease or term3
for taking over the Burlington. A strong; j
effort is under way, however, to secure
control of the Burlington and to- turn It
over .to the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern. These proposals originate .
with President J. J. Hill, and the negotia
tions are entirely in his hands. Whether)
he will be successful In inducing- the pres
ent management of the Burlington to ac- Â¦
cept his proposals remains to be seen. It
is believed that Mr. Hill is prepared to
bid a high cash price for Burlington, to
lease it at a specified guaranteed rental
or to exchange the stock for new bondsâ
as the Lake Shore and Michigan Central
was acquired by the New York Central. I
In such negotiations the Hill Interests j
have the advantage - of owning heavy
amounts of stock of Burlington, bougnt \
at much lower prices, both directly and
through allied banking interests In New j
York, which would be voted In favor of ;
any prcposal looking to securing the I
Burlington for the Northern Pacific road.
At present It may be stated on good
authority that the effort to secure control,
of the Burlington is evidently in the hands â¢
of Mr. .Hill. J. P. Morgan has taken nor
active part In the negotiations, as he did.
In those to secure the St. Paul. If Mr.
Hill succeeds in securing: the Burlington t
and the options are offered to the North- '
ern Pacinc Railway to share with the J
Great Northern any guarantee or to Join
In purchase price it will undoubtedly
be accomplished. At the present time
the proposal remains in an indefinite
shape, pending the outcome of Mr. Hill's
efforts to reach an agreement with the j
Burlington directors. President Perkins \
Is said to be on his way East to Boston, j
and it is believed that a definite offer will j
be made to â¢ the Burlington board this j
week. j

Miss McCann accused Captain Wittman
of assisting Gottlob In ridding himself of
her and says that last November she was
sent to the policeman's office to receive
Oioney. At that place a brother of th*
manager gave her $35. and Wlttman
threatened her with arrest- should shÂ«
cause any further annoyance.
Miss McCann was accused last Novem
ber for attempted extortion of money from
C. W. Smith of the Redlngton Drug Com
pany, but the warrant waa never served
on her. r
On Tuesday Miss McCann met Harry
L,ask, a notary public and urged him to
bring Gottlob to her. She said she wanted
no money and would make no demands.
A meeting was arranged In the evening
In a Powell-street cafe, and when Lask
and the woman stepped from a side en
trance Police Officer Sylvester. In citizen's
clothes, was on hand and arrested her on
tho orders of Captain "Wittman. She waa
kept In the tanks all night and charged
yesterday with vaÂ§rrancy. Her attorney
says he will fight the case and subpena
prominent witnesses. This statement may
cause seme well known citizens to feel
uneasy.

me a new life in the new century. Let your

one* this winter. It pains me even to tell
you. I passed you On Montgomery street with
Marx one morning early In January. I was
drenched and hungry. I had not supper the
night before and nothing to eat when you met
me. nor a nickel for carfare. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Oh,

Miss . McCann states that she was the
companion of Gottlob for nearly sixteen
years. About a year and a half ago the
two separated, she says. The woman,
hearing of the manager's engagement to
Miss Dannenbaum. wrote him a note on
Monday, telling of her poverty-stricken
condition and of hen wounded feelings.

Special Dispatch" to The Call.
Ex-Sheriff of Sacramento
County Ends Life by
LEE STANLEY'S
TRAGIC PASSING
Senators Bard and Perkins have recently
exchanged views regarding the ; Federal
office in question. It ; appears that, the
principals â Valentine â¢ and Flintâ have Â¦ ex
pressed to . each other sentiments ;-: of
friendship and' a "desire for compromise.
The Call's information Is to the effect that
Mr. Flint will: hold the office for one, year
longer and will then be succeeded by Mr:
Valentine.
Immediately after the election of
Thomas R. Bard to the United States
Senate L. H. Valentine put in an applica
tion to be appointed United States At
1 torney for the Southern District of Cali
fornia to succeed Frank P. Flint. The
petition In favor of the proposed change
embraced the names of nearly if not all
the members of the Legislature who voted
for Mr. Bard. At first the newly elected
Senator v/as inclined to recommend Mr.
Valentine's appointment, but after reflec-,
tlon * and consultation he did not seem'
anxious to grant the prayer of the petl-"
tloners. While Senator Bard was medi
tating and listening to suggestions from
Serator Perkins, the politicians, in South
ern . California were talcing sides either
for or against the recommendation. , The
friends of the ; change Insisted that Mr.
.Valentine, who occupied the Important po
sition of chairman of the Assembly Ways
and Means Committee, deserved credit for
his manly attitude throughout the pro
longed Senatorial struggle. At the regu
lar session Mr. Valentine . supported Mr.
Bulla's candidacy as long as the latter
was in the field, and then Joined the ranks
of General Barnes' column. At the final
rcund-up in the extra session, when all
the power of corporations and railroad
politicians was exerted to prevent Mr.
Bard from becoming the choice of the Re
publican majority. Mr. Valentine stood
manfully for the honor, of . the State and
sustained the candidacy, of the Venturan.
Many members of the Legislature were
Irdignant when they heard that Senator
Bard had hesitated to vigorously advocate
the. appointment of Mr. Valentine. On
theother hand, many well-known Repub
licans in the south and elsewhere . pro
tested against the proposed change, hold
'ng that Mr. Flint had performed the du
ties'of the office in a manner highly cred
itable to the Federal service, and that on
account of his ability and integrity should
bo retained In office. Stories that Mr.
Flint went to Sacramento during the con
test to help the railroad were promptly,
refuted.' The facts were disclosed -that
the United States Attorney for the South
ern District was In Sacramento but five
hours. and while there did not In any man
ner seek to influence a vote for or against
any. candidate. > , .

LONG FIGHT FOR
FEDERAL OFFICE
,*EZ in ? out the weeds growing in our
neighbor s yard we would better our
selves and ennoble the world. I am try
ing to better myself, to uplift myself, to
be. true to myself. That is one of the
reasons, why I allow no intoxicating
drink in my home and feel I have no
right to permit It to be sold or served In
properties that I own."
Mrs. Drexler has not come to the con
clusions she now professes hastily. Sho
has considered the practical side of tho
question as well as the spiritual side.
"I know," she said, "that I can got
bigger rents from liquor dealers than
from any other class of tenants. In re
fusing to accept them I am sacrificing
myself financially."
Mrs. Drexler represents no club or
party in the stand she has taken In the
temperance movement. She Is not a
member of the Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union or any other woman's club.
She is a woman of strong opinions and
with the courage of her convictions. She
Is young, charming and attractive and In
dependently rich.
; While not a society woman in the usual
ly accepted meaning 1 of the phrase, she
2 s .entertained extensively and during
the lifetime of her husband her Vam Ness
avenue mansion was the scene of many
gatherings of literary and artlatlc people.
The commonplace never had any charm
for Mrs.^Drexler and only the highest and
noblest have ever appealed to her.
Lomis P. Drexler. whose many millions
his young wife inherited, passed away at
his \ an Ness-avenue residence In Au
gust. 1899. He was one of the best known
capitalists of the State. In nearly even
direction of commercial enterprise he was
Interested and In every line did his
energy, Industry and honesty cause him to
thrive and prosper. He was especially
successful as a miner, stock raiser and
vineyardlst and Invested largely ir. real
estate. Although he Interested himself
in various concerns he had most pride in
his magnificent Fresno vineyard, in which
he had invested $300,000.
n< D !T d ? r ll^, 8 - fortun e which reached
nearly to the four million mark and the
bulk of which was inherited by his widow
'It is premature to discuss the question
at present," she said. "I fear that pub
licity at the present immature state ot
my plans may harm the cause I wouM
serve and perhaps antagonize the people
I am prepared to encounter many ob-
"I am in earnest In thl= matter and un
changeable. I have *he kindest feeling
toward you. but do not care to have wines
or any Intoxicating 'iquors sold directlv
or indirectly in any of my buildings."
Mrs. Drexler refuses to discuss her
motives in the cause of temperance or
the reasons that have brought her to
her present decision. â¢ --
All of the dealers whose business has
caused them to fall under the displeasure
of Mrs. Drexler have bet*n for many years
the tenants of the ladv and of her late
husband before her. N. H. Campbell has
occupied his present quarters in the Front
street building for the past thirty years.
Leisen & Co. have been Drexler tenants
for more than five years: Hermann Gcr-i
ken for two years, and Spieling for more
than seven years. Each and every, one
of these people have been treated with
the utmost conslderat-o,; by Mrs. Drexler.
They have been told that while they ar"
no longer desirable tenants. -still they will
be given ample lime to move. To one of
the tenants, who made a written appeal to
the lady that she reconsider her decision
she wrote: . Â¦ .
All Old Tenants.
in the liquor traffic that the premises they
occupy must be vacated within a reason
able time. A notice to this effect was
served upon the tenants several days ago
and all appeal to Mrs. Drexler to recon
sider her decision has proved without
avail. N. H. Campbell, 402 Front street;
Leisen & Co., 222 Clay street: Â¦ Henry
Spiering. 314 Front street; Hermann Ger
ken, 400 Front street, and S. H. Tyler &
Son, 308-314 Front street, are among those
whom Mr. McCall, agent for Mrs. DreK
ler. has notified that it would be desirable
for them to leave the premises they now
occupy. All who have received notice. are
engaged in the liquor traffic in one form
or another with the exception of the firm
of S. H. Tyler & Son. dOS-314 Front street.
Mr. Tyler has sublet T.e of the Drexler
stores to Spiering, a saloon . man, and
unless he agrees that Spiering vacate the
place he (Tyler) will no lenger be consid
ered as a desirable tenant and his request
for the renewal of his lease will be de
nied.
LATE CAPITALIST AND HIS CHARMING WIDOW. WHO HAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT NO WINES NOR IN
tSat C^t'b E I 'owxe R d O bv^: Y r . KI - ND MAY BE SOLD DIRECT^ Â° R g tot Bmu.mo ,
About fifty maehfne hands tn the ship
yards were laid off vesterday. with the
understanding that they will alternate
with the. fifty still at work, each set work-
Ing two days and laying off two days
The fitters point this out as an Illustration
of the way in which the whole shipyard
will gradually be tied no unless the
â¢handy men' are sent back to the work of
common laborers.
In a nutshell." one of the strikers said
yesterday, "we are trying to preserve the
integrity of our trade and to protect our
positions for the future. About fifty
'handy men' are employed In the ship
fitting department. They get from $1 to
32 25 per day. Our wages are from $3 to
S3 50. A* fast as these men. who are
taken off the trucks and from bolting-up
wnrk and such laborers' employment are
able to do portions of fitting they are set
Â»t It. displacing the skilled mechanics
Just as soon as the present rush of work
is over there will be a lot of men laid
off. and It will be the fitters at the top
wages. The 'handy men' are the ones
who will be kept at work. The only pro
tection for us lies fn striking at the root
of the trouble. If the laborers are left
at their work, unler.s they are willing to
Â«erve an apprenticeship, and competent
flttere are to do the fitting our
positions will be safe. Otherwise we may
just as well get out of the trade or go
elsewhere at once, for we will be crowded
out by the cheaper men."
Strikers Feared Discharge.
"This Is not saying that any threat 1?
made." said Mr. Scott. "None has beer
made. This strike is regarded as be'
of too little importance to call for Â«-â¢
threats. We are having no confer^
with the strikers. We do not talk to r~ n
who are not in our employ. Had they
come to us before adopting the hasty and
jash course of striking we would "have
given their grievance careful considera
tion. Many cf the mf n who are now str'k
ing to compel the transfer of the 'handy
men' from the fitting department learned
the trade themselves as 'handy men.' and
now they want the. opportunity they en
.i'jyed denied to other men. The appren
tices are reouired Ut work but 300 days of
the year. That gives them a considerable
leeway outside the holidays and Sundays
of the year. They are not penalized for
loss of time if they work the 300 days."
The fitters and apprentices are confident
of success, but say that they will give up
the trade rather than ,70 back to work un
der conditions as they exist at present.
No Threats Made.
In regard to those cruisers, Henry T.
ficott said yesterday that the belief of the
titters that those contracts would operate
to coerce the builders to grant the de
mands of the strikers was a mistaken
one. He points out that the Union Iron
Works was the lowest bidder in each case
and hence is at liberty to build the
cruisers wherever it sees fit. Had the
contracts be*n given under the "4 per cent
clause" of the Congressional act, to in
jure the building of two cruisers on the
Pacific Coast at a cost of not more than
4 per cent more than the lowest bid the
vessels would have to be built. on the Pa
cific Coast. As it Is they may be built
.on the Delaware or anywhere else the
builders may choose.
The steamship Spokane, for the Alaskan
trade, is scheduled to be launched Satur
day, but yesterday the riveters refused
to rivet the bilge keÂ«l and the launching
may not take place on the date set. Ma
chine riveting: cannot be trusted on the
bilge ke* a l and pang after gang of the
riveters have refused to touch the work
fitted by the "handy men."
The great steamship Alaskan, the largest
ever built on the coast, was practically
deserted by the mechanics yesterday
The slip occupied by it and that occupied
by the Spokane are needed for the build-
Ing of the two armored cruisers, the con
tract? for which are held by the Union
Irnn Works.
Launching May Be Delayed.
The Boiler Makers' and Iron Shipbuild
ers' L'nion. to which the riveters belong,
held a special meeting last night at the
Pctrero Opera-house, but nothing definite
was decided upon. Another special meet
ing wrtl probably be held not later than
to-rcorrow night.
The riveters are giving the strikers their
support. The Fhipyards of the Union Iron
"Work? given tteady employment to about
3H0 riveters, with 150 "holders-on" and 100
boy helpers. The riveting is done al
most entirely by piece work, instead of by
th<? day. Af* fast as the riveters reach
work fitted by the "handy men" instead
of the fitters they are refusing to touch it.
CJang after gang has quit work for that
TTpapon. until about !<*> of them, with ap
proximately another lty "holders-on" and
bnys. are laying cff.
ThÂ»Â» "handy men," or helpers, who. after
a few years of irregular work at fitting,
are gradually shoved ahead until they
do the work of Journeymen fitters, are the
<-euf-e of all the trouble. The employes
say that If skill is to count In their trade
this custom must be discontinued and the
"handy men" put back at their trucks or
â¢wherever they were previously employed
as common laborers. The employers
say that no mechanic or set of mechanic?
In their service has the right to say who
eha.ll or who shall not be employed.-

Board of. Education Appoints Forty
Census Marshals â Superintendent
Webster Files Estimate of
Funds Required.
, After the meeting of the Board of Edu
cation had adjourned yesterday morning
Director Denman expressed the opinion
that there were too manj women teachers
In the School DetÂ»artment at the present
time. Denman contends that In schools
Â¦where : boys predominate men pedagogue*
. should be employed In greater numbers.
This opinion had somethinff to do with
Â¦the rejection of Miss Morton's application.
She sought promotion from the vice
principalship to the prlncipalship of the
Hamilton Grammar School, to which A.
E. Kellogg was appointed.
Denman deplores the fact that some
grammar schools are without male teach
ers and in future says he will voto to place
men at the head of Important classes,
Denman's convictions, however, are not
shared by his three colleagues, so It Is
safe to say that no radical changes will
be made.
The resolution compelling teachers to
serve a probationary term of three years
was voted down by the board.
The following named census marshals
were appointed to assist Chief Ellert In
taking the census? of school children at a
salary of $5 per day each:
Thomas F. Dolan, William S. Mulvln. Philip

Hamilton Grammar School on April 1 was
rescinded- and the appointment madÂ» to
take efTect June 1. 1901. i
An exhibit of the drawing now complet

pupils from the A section to the B section
of a class on the term standing combined
with an examination by the principal.
