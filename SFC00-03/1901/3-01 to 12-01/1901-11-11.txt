* TCPEKA, Kans., Nov. Sheriff Cook
( f tils county and Deputy Sheriff Wil
liams were captured by two of the es
%&.ped Federal penitentiary convicts this
afternoon at Pauline, rive miles south of
here, and held for several hours. The
convicts, whose names cannot be learned,
then escaped through a line of policemen,
going eastward.
At 2:30 o'clock this afternoon some
farmer boys near Pauline became ac
quainted with the fact that the convicts
â¢were in the neighborhood and soon had
a. posse organized and were in pursuit.
The escaped prisoners had no arms or
ammunition and were compelled to run
before the posse, which was armed with
Â£2-callber rifles, small pistols, clubs and
almost every other kind of weapon.
The Sheriff soon heard of the chase and
started for the scene. He and Deputy
Williams came up to the convicts and
both of the officers fired, wounding the
men, but not disabling them. The con
victs then fled through a small open space
in the timber and ran into the house of
If a farmer named Wooster. The officers
followed.
Runs Into Arms of Convict.
Sheriff Cook believed the convicts had
run around the house and he darted
through the open door, intending to sur
prise them at the back door. But, in
stead of this, the convicts had gone into
the house and as the Sheriff ran in he
fell right into the arms of the convict
nearest the door. He was ordered to give
up his revolver, which he did. Deputy
Sheriff Williams had by this time reached
the house, not knowing what had occur
red, and he, too, was gathered in by the
convicts.
Before he was captured the Sheriff had
been thoughtful enough to telephone to
Topeka for help. Chief Stahl, with eight
officers, hastened to the scene and arrived
there after the other officers had been
imprisoned about an hour.
Chief Stahl immediately began negotia
tions with the convicts to give up their
prisoners and surrender themselves, but
they could not see it that way. Farmer
Wooster then managed to get a gun and
made an attack on the convicts, but was
laid low by a blow from the butt of a
â revolver. The fugitives broke Wooster's
1 right hand and cut an ugly gash in his
* head.
Threaten to Kill Sheriff.
The leader of the convicts told Sheriff
Cook that he would be killed if he made
the slightest move looking toward their
capture, and he promised to be good. In
the meantime the police officers on the
outside were afraid to do anything, be
cause the convicts threatened to kill the
Imprisoned officers if they did.
At 7 o'clock the convicts had managed
to revive Mrs. Wooster, who had fainted
from fright, and placed Sheriff Cook and
her in front of them as shields. They
then started out, after first exacting a
promise from Sheriff Cook that he would
not permit any of the officers to fire at
them. The prisoners left the house and
started down the railroad t^ack. They
Â¦walked through a cordon of police-offi
cers, who could have captured them eas
ily, but the Sheriff had given the con
victs his word that they would not be
molested. After walking down for some
distance, the convicts suddenly disap
peared through a hedge fence, after bid
ding the officers a mocking farewell. One
of the police sergeants in attendance said
he could easily have touched the leading
p* convict with his hand as he passed.
Prevents Capture of Fugitives.
The convicts got a good start before
the officers recovered from their surprise.
Then some of the policemen wanted to
pursue, but the Sheriff would not permit
it, as. he said he had promised the fugi
tives immunity from arrest.
The Chief of Police started back to
town, but left some of his men on the
econe, and they began a chase later or.
They expect to capture the convicts be
fore morning, as the entire country is
aroused. <:'
The convicts are well armed, as they
took all the weapons in the farmhouse.
Including those of the officers. Both are
Â¦white men.
Sheriff Cook arrived from Pauline at 10
o'clock to-night. He was somewhat dis
figured and his clothes were ragged,' but
he had lost rone of his nerve by his usage
at the hands of the convicts. In telling
the e-ory of his experiences he made no
attempt to conceal the humorous aspect
the affair. Sheriff Cook said that when

scene in the afternoon one of the farmer

REDDING. Xov. 10.â Governor Geer of
Oregon has instructed the police and de
tectives of that State, and particularly
those Â¦ from Salem south to the Oregon
line, to keep a sharp lookout for suspi
cious characters, who may be those who
by letter have boldly threatened his life.
A missive which he received may have
been intended as a joke, but the Governor
has thought enough of it to place the in
formation in the hands of the officers.
The would-be murderers claim that they
live at Dunsmuir and at Redding. The
threatening letter, demanding the release
of a prisoner, with the Governor's death
as the alternative, is thought to have
been written by parties who wished their
demand acceded to but who may not have
meant to carry out the vengeance they
suggest.
Text of the Letter.
The letter is written on a letterhead of
the Mount Shasta Hotel, at Dunsmuir.
Apparently it was not mailed for several
days after being written or cisc is dated
back. The full text of the letter Is as fo'.

snapped his revolver five times, but only
two cartridges exploded. One bullet hit
the bigger of the convicts fn the arm,

TUCSON, Nov. 10.â E. A. Davis of San
Francisco, Senator John F. Davis of Ama
dor, Cal., and J. N. Curtis, manager of the
Silver Bell copper mines, were witnesses
of a startling phenomenon while riding
south of Red Rock station on the South
ern Pacific railroad last Wednesday after
noon.
The party was three miles from Red
Rock at 5:20 p. m., when a meteor of
enormous size and matchless beauty came
into view directly above Picacho peak. A
moment later it burst with a distinct re
port that seemed like the sound of a
distant cannon shot. The sky for miles
arourJG was lighted as if by a gigantic
rocket. The illumination lasted for a few
seconds and was succeeded by a light
cloud of smoke.
All the members of the party saw the
explosion and were convinced from the
clearness of the report that It must have
occurred at no very great distance. Red
Rock is thirty-three miles west of this
city.

another fired at him with a revolver.
Bakka drew his knife and tried to carve
his way through the highwaymen. He
stabbed one in the breast and another in
the Bhoulder. They closed in upon him,
however, and his case was looking hope

men took to their heels. The police are
looking for them to-day, but so far have

WAR'S BURDEN
TO FALL UPON
CAPE COLONY
New Scheme Involves a
Levy of Loyalists
En Masse.
LONDON, Nov. 11.â In a letter dated Oc
tober 23, the Cape Town correspondent of
the Daily Mail says:
"Lord Kitchener and Sir John Gordon
Sprigg (the Cape Premier), have arranged
a scheme for the expulsion of the invaders
from Cape Colony. A joint commission of
imperial and colonial military chiefs has
been sitting here for some days past to
draft a scheme.
"It is understood that this provides for
the colony taking a large share in the fu
ture campaign and contributing largely
toward its cost. Apparently a levy of
loyalists en masse is the idea involved."
According to the Daily News Major
General lan Hamilton, who sailed on
Saturday for South Africa to act as Lord
Kitchener's chief of staff, takes a plan
prepared in London for a more vigorous
campaign with a view of ending the war
before the coronation festivities begin.
"General Hamilton's appointment," says
the Dally News, "is part of a plan ar
ranged after the King's return from the
continent about six weeks ago. Unless
Lord Kitchener should decline to be
complaisant the new scheme Is likely to
develop about the beginning of the year.''

SUPPLYING RICE
TO INSURGENTS
Strong Evidence Accum

Agent.
MANILA, Nov. 10.â Incriminating: evi
dence is accumulating- against Gibson
Easton, the representative of two of the
largest firms in Manila who were recent
ly expelled from Samar on a charge of
dealing with the insurgents, and he prob
ably will be arrested and tried. Lukban's
commissary general, who was recently
captured, says that both concerns had
agreements with Lukban to furnish 500
sacks of rice each year.
According to advices from Catbalogan,
capital of Samar, Insurgent Leader Luk
ban has sent a message to General Smith
declaring that he will not listen to ne
gotiations for surrender until all the
Americans have withdrawn from the Gan
dara Valley.
General Smith has ordeFed every Amer
ican soldier in the island of Samar and
the island of Leyte never to be without
arms, even at meal time. He is deter
mined that there shall be no more sur
prises. General Smith also directs that
scouting must continue incessantly, and
that all rice and hemp captured must be
destroyed. He considers the capture of
Lukban only a question of a short time.
The Federation continues its meetings
here, but these are, as a rule, of a tur
bulent character, and very little is ac
complished. Personal bickerings prevent
harmony. Senor Buencamino challenged
Senor Velasco to a duel, but the latter re
fused to fight on account of the age of
the challenger.
Many provincial delegates have al
ready left in disgust. Senor Sabella Reyes
wanted to enter upon the minutes of the
convention an expression of the regret
felt by the delegates at the lack of Inter
est displayed in the work of political or
ganization. Thrice Senor Buencaminu left
the room, saying he would never return.
In each instance he yielded to the per
suasion of his friends that he should go
back, and finally he formally tendered his
resignation, but only to put in an appear
ance again at the evening session.
The question of the friars has been oc
cupying much of the attention of the
convention. Intense antipathy is shown
toward them, and the sense of the con
vention was practically unanimous that
they must go.

that were pending between Turkey and
Austria-Hungary. ' , \

M. Delcasse authorizing him to resume

PARIS, Nov. 10.â The French Foreign
Office has announced that the Sultan has
issued an irade for the execution of his
engagements with' the French Govern
ment, and that the ' Franco-Turkish dis
pute Is now at an end.
Tewfik Pasha, Ottoman Minister of For
eign Affairs, wrote a letter to M. Bapst,
counselor of the French embassy in Con
stantinople, notifying him of the signing
of the irade, which, while settling tho
( original .French i demands, accepts the
French demands as set forth in a dlspatcn
from Constantinople on Friday, together
with an additional clause by which the
Sultan pledges himself to consider as
authorized in full right the foundations,
extensions, constructions and repairs of
the schools and religious and hospital es
tablishments which France may desire to
carry out 1 if the Porte is advised of her
intentions and makes no objections with
in five months.
Diplomatic Relations Resumed.
. France has thus received full satisfac
tion, and M. Delcasse on the receipt of M.
Bapst's dispatch this morning telegraphed
him to inform Tewnk Pasha that diplo
matic relations had been resumed and
that M. Bapst should consider himself as
regularly charged with the affairs of the
embassy.
Instructions were also sent to Admiral
Caillard at Mitylene to re-embark the
marines and to return to Greek waters,
which is understood to mean the vicinage
of the islands of Syria. Admiral Caillard
will remain in the Levant some time long

dor, will return to Constantinople shortly.
The additional clause was conceded a

future difficulties, such as the Turkish
provincial authorities have often raised,
either on their own initiative or in con
sequence of instigation by the Porte. The
Temps, which . describes the result as a
"brilliant victory for French diplomacy."
says:
Effect of Franco's Victory.
"The great merit v of the Government
was in being able to restrict its action.
Very serious difficulties might have arisen
had France departed from her reserve.
The favorable disposition shown to our
representations abroad has been due to
the fact that ttie civilized world has had
opportunity during the last seven years
to observe the progress of the anti-Euro
pean movement in . the Sultan's councils.
Frenchmen, Americans, Austrians, Ital
ians and Britons have all been victimized
by the Sultan and his counselors. After
the Armenian massacres and the success
ful war with Greece they thought every
thing was permitted to them.
"We â¢ hope the Sultan will now under
stand his duties toward the civilized pow
ers and toward his own subjects, unto
whom he has taken solemn engagements
which he has always disregarded. Other
wise Europe, which, thanks to the ener
getic action of France, is now able to re
assume at Constantinople the authority
she lost seven years ago, will applaud the
initiative which the signatory powers of
the Berlin treaty are reported to be about
to take to extort from the Sultan 'the exe
cution of clauses too long fallen into did
use."
Differing Views of Press.
The morning papers in their comments
upon the termination of the Franco-Tur
kish incident follow party lines strictly.
The supporters of the Government hail
the outcome as a great diplomatic, moral
and material success. Other journals eith
er affect skepticism witn reference to the
final outcome or assume that it Is really
a check disguised under the more or less
illusory concessions promised by the Sul
tan. Some papers even hint that France
has . actually backed down, owing to the
coolness with which the powers have re

ROOSEVELT
ADHERES TO
HIS IDEAS
Insists Upon Legislation
to Regulate Big
Combines.
Urges That They Be Com
pelled to Show Intrinsic
Value of Securities.
Congress Will Be Asked to Pass Lavs
* Protecting Employes in
Their Right to Or
ganize.
Special Dispatch to The Cla.ll.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â In his
forthcoming message to Congress Presi
dent Roosevelt will take- strong grounds
in favor of legislation to compel the trusts
and vast industrial combinations to
change their attitude toward the public.
Mr. Roosevelt desires to safeguard the
interests of Investors by requiring great
companies like the United States Steel
Corporation, that do an interstate busi
ness, to make known the facts as to the
intrinsic value of their securities. He may
also advise Congress to pass laws that
will protect employes in their right to
organize, and he is expected to favor an
amendment to the Sherman anti-trust law
that will enable the Department of Jus
tice to get evidence of the existence of a
monopoly without employing detective
methods.
All other questions under consideration
in the White House are being overshad
owed by the recommendations President
Roosevelt will make with reference to
these great industrial combinations. The
chapter of his message dealing with this
subject has already been written. It has
been read to several persons outside the
Cabinet. Some of the men who hayÂ« lis
tened to the chapter are themselves deep
ly concerned in trusts. Most of them
have expressed dissatisfaction with the
message, believing that it would be more
to their interest if the President would
refrain from bringing up the subject
at all.
Firm in His Attitude.
But the President will not be dissuaded.
His views are of long growth and settled
conviction. He believes something should
be done as between the great corporations
and the workingmen, and he is positive
that something can be done for the in
vestor when stacks of so-called invest
ments are put on the market. .
Much uneasiness has been expressed by
the heads of some of the big combina
tions lest the President should take such
a course as would precipitate a panic.
When the President has expressed his
purposes *to them they have been com
pelled to admit that his position is ra
tional, and that no corporation, properly
organized, need have the slightest fear
that injustice will be done.
"Publicity " is to be the watchword of
Mr. Roosevelt on this important ques
tion. He will recommend that Congress
pass a law that will guarantee the public
against fraud and enable investors to
know exactly what they are buying when
they purchase industrial stocks. This will
appeal with strong force to thousands of
persons who have been led into making
investments In securities, only to discover
that they have been deceived by flnancal
freebooters and that the stocks they hayÂ©
purchased are not worth the value of old
paper.
Just how Congress can carry out the
President's wishes is a question that is
not yet clear. One member of the Cabi
net has suggested that provision be made
in the statutes imposing a heavy internal
revenue tax on corporations that do not
disclose facts the public is entitled to
know, and remitting the tax in the case
of each corporation that gives to inves
tors proper information.
Other Ttust Problems.
It is believed that President Roosevelt
will make other recommendations as to
the regulation and curbing of trusts. The
serious problem of overcapitalization has
been brought home to him very closely
within the last few weeks by official fig
ures of the watering of stocks which have
been laid before him. The general im
pression is that he is going to hit straight
from the shoulder, but. at the same time,
make a clear distinction between indus
trials that are conducted in an honest,
businesslike way and tnose that are in
flated to unload upon the public.
Hard headed lawyers like Secretary ot
War Root and Attorney General Knox
and hard headed financiers like Secretary
Gage and Senator Hanna would prefer
that this trust matter be held back. They
can see little good that can be accom
plished at this time. They look on these
great combinations as the inevitable re
sult of business development, and they
believe that if any effort were made to
upset existing conditions it might cause
untold hardship and a serious disarrange
ment of the business and financial affairs
of the country. But it is hardly likely
President Roosevelt can be persuaded to
ignore the question.
President Roosevelt will in his message

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10.â News comes
from Ensenada of the tragic death of
Frank Cook, a Norwegian carpenter, who
was well known here and throughout the
r peninsula as far south as San
Quintin.
In a rocky part of the mining district
of Santa Catarina in the Rosario section,
two men who were hunting found on a
hill near a canyon the body of an indi
vidual covered with horrible wounds
b had evidently been made by the
ul some carnivorous animal. O.n
their return to their homes they immedi

There was every evidence that the beast
attacked ir.e man and after a des
perate battle had succeeded in killing
iim.
Cook had been employed by Harry
Johnson in San Quintin, from which place
he set out for the Santa Catarina dis
trict in August last. He had been work
ing since men at Santa Catarina, princi
pally on the group of mines called Julio
Cesar, and had suddenly disappeared
from there. No one knew what had be
come of him.
After a few days of constant watching
in front of the cavern hunters killed the

HERO OF CAMAR PASS
NOW IN AMERICAN ARMY
Major Valentine Delaporte Now
Serves With Eighteenth United
States Infantry.
SALT LAKE. Nov. 10.â The "Hero of
Camar" is not dead. He is serving as pri
vate in the Eighteenth United States In
fantry-
During the Afghan war. In which Lord
Roberts gained his first great laurels,
Major Valentine Delaporte became one o:
the idols of the English people. The Af
ghans held a pass at Camar and the en
tire British army was checked. Major
Delaporte, with a volunteer company of
Sepoys, attempted to storm the heights,
but every man of his command was
killed. He returned, and Lord Roberts
gave him a company from the Inniskillen
Fusiliers. Witn the Irishmen at his back
he swept up the crags and drove out the
enemy. Later he performed other deeds
of valor, for which he was put on Lord
Roberts' staff and given the Victoria
cross. He returned to England and be
came the lion cf the hour. "The young
hero of the pase " was showered with at
tentions. This is what caused his down
fall. The pace was too swift for him. He
plunged deeper and deeper into debt.
Finally the Government stepped in. He
was "cashiered " and left the army in dis
grace. Coming to America he drifted
westward, working in the mines of Colo
rado and Utah for a time. Then he en-
Jisied in the United States army. He has
followed the fortunes of the Eighteenth
during three terms of enlistment and has
distinguished Himself so greatly that hi
has several times been offered promotion.
But he has refused. Hp wishes to sink
from sight. He was recognized yesterday
by a man who had been with him in Af
ghanistan, and he even now shrinks from j
having his identity known.

CHIEF OF POLICE SULLIVAN'S LIFE
ENDS AT EARLY HOUR THIS MORNING
Softening of Brain and Heart Failure, Mainly Caused by Close Ap
plication to Work When His System Was Weakened by Prev
ious Sickness, Bring Death to Police Department's Head
CHIEF OF POLICE WILLIAM P.
SULLIVAN JR. died at 1:30
o'clock ihis morning, softening of
the brain and heart failure being
the causes.
Chief Sullivan was taken ill nearly two
weeks ago, and for the last three day*
was unconscious. His end was painless
and he passed away as if in peaceful
sleep in the presence of his sorrowing
wife and children and his family physi
cian, Dr. Bazet.
When Chief Sullivan was last taken ill
it was supposed that he was suffering
from an attack of the grip combined with
neuralgia and rheumatism. He had been
in failing health, due mainly to close ap
plication to his duties.
No apprehension was felt as to his con
dition until last Thursday morning, when
alarming symptoms set in. Dr. Bazet
summoned Dr. Gallwey and other physi
cians, and while they hoped for the best
they could give no assurance of recovery.
Since Chief Sullivan was stricken Cap
tain Wlttman has attended to the duties
of the office. The announcement of Chief
Sullivan's demise will be received with
deep sorrow by his hosts of friends and
citizens generally.
It is predicted that Captain Wlttman
will be elected to the position made
vacant by the death of Chief Sullivan. If
this prediction is verified he will be elect
ed, not to fill an unexpired term, but for
the full term of four years, as provided
by the charter. As Mayor-elect Schmitz
stated in an interview immediately after
his election that he was in favor of a

LATE HEAD OF THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHO
FORFEITED HIS LIFE AS THE PRICE OF TOO CLOSE ATTENTION
TO THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE.
thoroughly experienced man for the posi
tion of Chief, and was strongly opposed to
the election of any man not connected
with the department, it is believed that
the selection of Captain Wittman' will
meet with his approval.
With reference to the candidacy of for
mer Chief of Police Lees for the office, it
may be stated that he announced recently
that his case is in the hands of his
friends.
Came to California When a Boy.
William P. Sullivan Jr. was born in Massa
chusetts in 1857, his ancestors having emigrated
from Ireland. When he was 13 his father de
cided to come to California and brought his
family with him. William P. Sullivan Sr. Is
still alive and lives in the Western Addition.
The late Chief of Police received his educa
tion in the public schools of his native State
and in the Lincoln and High Schools of San
Francisco.
On leaving school 'William P. Sullivan Jr. se
cured a position with the firm of Burtis &
Pewey, dry goods dealers, at Fifth and Mar
ket streets. He applied himself studiously to
business and he was rapidly advanced. He
was made chief bookkeeper and was finally
taken into the business, the firm taking the
name of Sullivan, Burtis & Dewey.
After the death of one of the elder members
of the firm, the business was purchased by
Kcane Bro=., and William P. Sullivan Jr. had
charsre of the offices.
The firm of Keane Bros, sold out to Kelly
Bros, and Sullivan decided to make a change.
He secured the Dosltlon of chief bookkeeper at
the Pacific Rolling Mills and held it up to the
time he was appointed by Mayor Phelan to be
his secretary, on January 1, 1597.
TH* late Chief of Police was not related to
Mayor Phelan, as generally supposed. Phelan
and Sullivan had been friends from boyhood
and when Phelan first ran for Mayor Sullivan
helped him in his campaign. Phelan recognized
the services of his friend by making him his
secretary.
In the Mayor's office Sullivan won a host of
friends. He was courteous and polite to all
who called there and with the re-election of
Phelan as Mayor Sullivan remained in office.
Sullivan was appointed to the position of
Chief of Police by the Police Commissioners
on February 14, 1900, and from the day he took
charge until he was prostrated by illness he
devoted his entire energy to his duties.
On February 15. 1900, Sullivan took office as
Chief of the Police Department. There were
many criticisms at the time that he assumed
the office, but Sullivan stood firmly against the
storm and won applause for the manner in
which he handled the department.
He Instituted many reforms in the depart
ment, especially In the matter of uniform,
drills, care in personal appearance and respect
to superior officers.
The Police Department was brought up to

Only a few years ago the business most
despised in New York was perhaps that

achieved the dignity of a union, whose
members are as rigid In the enforcement
of their rights as the men In any other
trade
a high standard of military efficiency under
the late Chief Sullivan. The uniforms were
of one pattern and the detail of placing white
stripes on the trousers served a very useful pur
pose. The Chief noticed that the police officers
would wear their blue uniform trousers when
off duty, with the result that their coats
looked neat and the nether garments shabby.
The white- stripes were utilized in order to
make tte officers take goW care of their entire
polire uniforms and only wear them when on
duty. t

Strict discipline was maintained in the de

was commented on by the late President Mc-
Kinley and the members ft the Presidential
It r*y when they visited tÃls city.
Chief Sullivan did yeoman work in taking
care that no harm befell the lamented Presi
dent McKinley while he was in this city. He
was constantly by the side of the chief exec
utive on the streets from the moment he ar
rived in San Francisco until he departed.

van was on duty almost continuously. He had
arisen from his bed, weak from an attack of
diphtheria, and though his physicians and his
wife pleaded with him. he insisted on attend
ing to his arduous duties. To this devotion to
his work Is principally attributed his untimely
taking off.
William P. Sullivan Jr. was one of the
founders of the League of the Cross Cadets,
and was honored by being- elected its first
colonel. He held that position for many years,
and resigned it when he was appointed to the
head of the Police Department, being Unable
to devote as much time to the welfare of
the cadets as formerly.
The late Chief became connected with the
National Guard of the State of California by
enlistment In Company H of the Third In
fantry, Second Brigade, December 2, 1878. He
continued as a private in that company until
January 19. 1880, when he was appointed ser

nation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 10.â There is an in
crease instead of a lessening In the scarc
ity of cars along the Southern Pacific
lines on the Oregon and the Shasta route,
and the lack of adequate rolling stock Is
interfering with both the business of the
railroad and of private Individuals and
corporations. Cars can only be had in the
most urgent cases for local and way
freight, and the mills and box factories
of Siskiyou County, as well as at points
along the line, are greatly interfered with.
It was thought that the ending of the
labor strike in San Francisco and the
moving of the crops would relieve this
state of affairs, but these incidents ap
pear to have had little effect in a favor
able way on the situation.
Redding is feeling the freight car scarc
ity in many ways. More than |250,000
worth of building is going on in the city.
With the rainy season approaching and
the demand for room increasing, every
small delay is very costly. Work on sev
eral large buildings has been delayed
for weeks for want of supplies which
could not reach here. It is now almost im
possible to bring lumber from Portland.
Offers of premiums even fall to get the
cars. One local lumber yard whose sup
ply comes from Oregon has failed la
mentably in keeping up its stock, and as
a last resort has ordered the lumber
shipped from Portland by water to San
Francisco on the charice that it may be
possible to obtain cars to bring it here
from San Francisco.
The Bully Hill smelter has had a diffi
cult time in shipping its copper ingots to
New Jersey to be refined. At length great
quantities of coke weresordered from the
East. As fast as it was delivered at Bella
Vista the coke cars are unloaded, filled '
with copper ingots and billed to Jersey
City. A train of cars loaded with coke
went north through Redding Saturday i
The coke was loaded in cattle cars and
strips of board were nailed over the ap
ertures along the sides of the cars to
keep it from streaming out. Even then '
the loss was considerable. Work at the
Sweepstake mine has been delayed be
cause of lack of cars to bring the pipe
as fast as needed. Many other mines i
have suffered.

Sutherland, chairman of the company :
has been on Puget Sound for several days
and is now en route to San Francisco, via i
Portland.
â¢The Sutherland turret steamer Calth- '
ness has been a familiar craft on the Pa

before leaving that Frank Waterhouse &
Co. had been selected as agents for the
Sutherland Company, and that two
steamers will soon be operated regularly
from the Sound to Manila and China.
Each steamer will have a lumber carry

TO ESCAPE BROKERS
Explanation Made Why the Japanese
Marquis Was Reported in
Poor Health.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 10.â Marquis
Ito's recent illness in this country caused
much alarm in Japan when first an
nounced there. Some papers did not print
the news, fearing it would produce a bad
effect.
Japanese advices arriving: to-night by
the steamship Victoria state that the Jap
anese Minister at Washington cabled an
explanation of Ito's illness which caused
much satisfaction in Tokio. He said Mar
quis Ito found it necessary to plead ill
ness for diplomatic purposes in order to
avoid the importunities of Chicago brok
ers and bond-buyers who desired to pur
chase Japanese bonds. This resulted from
a rumor which preceded him to the effect
that his purpose in visiting America was
to negotiate a large sale of bonds.

DB. PIEBCE'S BEMEDIES.
DISGRUNTLED.
Men Who Manufacture Misery.
The disgruntled man, the man who is
sulky and dissatisfied under all condi-
tions and circumstances, is to be found
everywhere. Even at the sea side where
he has gone for rest and recreation
you'll find him surly and sulky, grum-
bling at the weather, the people, the
hotel accommodations, the Doard, and
everything else. His scowling, sullen
visage checks the flow of talk at the
table, and hushes the prattle of playing
children. Now and again one gossip
says to another "The old chap's liver
must be out of order." Somebody else
says, Â¦ Perhaps he's suffering from kid-
ney trouble. 7 ' And a majority incline to
the opinion that ii's "just dyspepsia."
And as it happens they are all of them
right. His liver is sluggish. His kidneys
are disordered. His blood is necessarily
poisoned, by accumulations of effete
matter. And last of all his stomach is
"out of order." This is another case in
which in the logical sequence of state-
ment
THfi I^ST IS FIRST.
The liver is sluggish because the stom-
ach is diseased. The kidneys are dis-
ordered because the stomach and its al-
lied organs of digestion and nutrition
are " weak " and cannot supply adequate
nutrition for the needs of the body.
How do we know this? Because in so
many cases, persons who had suffered
with disease of heart, liver, lungs, kid-
neys, etc., have found these diseases en-
tirely cured, when Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery has cured diseases of
the stomach and the other organs of di-
gestion and nutrition.
" I was afflicted with what the doctors
called nervous indigestion. Took med-
icine from my family physician to no
avail. In looking over one of Doctor
Pierces Memorandum Books," writes
Mr. Thos. G. Lever, of Lever, Richland
Co., S. C, "I found my case described
exactly. I wrote to you and made a
statement. You sent me a descriptive
list of questions, also hygienic rules. I
carried these out as best I could, but
thought myself incurable as I suffered so
much with pain under my ribs and an
empty feeling in my stomach. At night
would have cold or hot feet and hands
alternately. I was getting very nervous
and suffered a great deal mentally, think-
ing that death would soon claim me. Al-
ways expected something unusual to
take place; was irritable and impatient,
and greatly reduced in flesh. I could
scarcely eat anything that would not
produce a bad feeling in my stomach.
After some hesitation, owins' to my
prejudices against patent medicines, I
decided to try a few bottles of Doctor
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and
' Pellets.' After taking several bottles
of each, found I was improving. I con-
tinued for six months or more, off and
on. I hay* to be careful yet at times, of
STAR AMAZES
THE SCIENTISTS
Astronomers Marvel at
Queer Doings in
the Sky.
SAN JOSE,% ov. 10.â W. W. ..Campbell
of Lick Observatory has issued the fol
lowing bulletin regarding a recent and im
portant discovery made by Professor Per
rlne, an .. attache .of the observatory at
Mount Hamilton:
A discovery of extraordinary Interest to as
tronomers has Just been made by Professor Per
rine in reference to the new star in the con
stellation Perseus. ! This star appeared sud
denly and unexpectedly last February, having
been discovered by Anderson In Edinburgh. In
some tour days its brightness increased from
invisibility id ordinary telescopes until It be
came the brightest star in the northern sky.
All available astronomical resources through
out the world were immediately devoted to the
Investigation of this remarkable object.
Many Interesting facts concerning it have
been brought to light. To mention only a few,
its brightness diminished irregularly from that
of the most prominent star In the northern
sky in February until in June it was on the
limit of visibility for trained and sensitive
eyesights, where it has since remained. The
star's atmosphere was violently disturbed, as
shown by a study of its epectrum in the spring
months, and since June, at least,* the spectro
scope has shown that it is now a nebula,
though retaining to the eye and In the telescope
the point-like form of an ordinary star. The
distance that gave rise to the new star was
sufficiently, violent to convert it from a dark
invisible body into a gaseous nebula. V
In August Professor Max "Wolf of Heidel
berg, Germany, secured a four-hour exposure
photograph of the region of the sky contain
ing- the - new star. His negative showed the
existence of Â¦ some extremely faint nebulous
patches about, five minutes of arc south of the
star, but with no evidence of any relationship
between the nebulous clouds and the star
On September 20 Ritchey at the Yerkes" Ob
servatory, photographed the same region with
a more efficient Instrument and found that
the nebulous cloud was very nearly circular
some ten minutes of arc in diameter but of
varying intensity in Its different part with
the new star . situated near the middle of thÂ«
nebulosity. vne
, A recent photograph secured by Professor
Perrine with the Crossley reflector recorded
principal features of the nebulous cloud til
compared his photograph with the Yerkes nhnl
tograph of the same object and made the to"
teresting discovery that the brightest nortiâ¢
of the nebula, at least, and perhaps * tL'whSS
nebula had moved to the southeast more than
one minute of arc In the past six wWk.
Tills observation is in every respect â¢,

suffering with indigestion or torpid liver

THK SCHOOL-BOY'S POCKET
is notorious for the miscellany it cot*.
tains. Tops, string, apples, marbles,
chewing gum, nails, jack-stones, are all
mixed in one confused mass. What
would be said of one who used that
pocket which we call the stomach for
xsuch a heterogeneous collection of ma-
terials? This is done not alone by the
human ostrich at the circus, but by thotv
sands of good people who do not consider
the relation of the stomach to the other
organs of the body. The purpose of eat-
ing is to provide nutrition for the body.
But how many people think of the nutri-
tive value of the food they eat ? For the
most part the choice of food is
made to please tne paiate. The
palate is a creature of education^
It may be taught to crave things
bitter or things sweet; to desire
spicy or fiery condiments which
irritate the 9tomach or dainties
which distress it, and in which
the food value is reduced to the
minimum. As a rule the palate ia
taught to desire the most unde-
sirable things from the view-
point of nutrition. The resu'.t is
that the stomach has to thresh a
great quantity of straw to obtain
one grain of nutrition.
The body is sustained by food
properly digested and assimilated
and converted into nutrition. But
when the food lacks nutritive
value the body and its organs
must be starved. Exactly the
same thing happens when the
food eaten is nutritious, but the
stomach and other organs of di-
gestion and nutrition being weak-
ened by disease, fail to extract
the nutrition from the food oroÂ«
vided. Then the body is starved also.
THE SIGN OF STARVATION
is weakness. A starved man can't work.
A starved organ can't work ; or at the
best it works partially and ineffectively.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery.
by curing diseases of the stomach ana
other organs of digestion and nutrition,
enables the perfect digestion and assimi-
lation of the food eaten, and this food
converted into nutrition, builds np the
body and all its parts and organs into
sound health and strength.
w After I had received the advice which
you gave me in regard to my treatment,*'
writes Geo. Dorner, Esq., of 1915 Pulaski
Street, Baltimore, Md., "I used your
4 Golden Medical Discovery ' according
to directions. After using four bottles I
considered myself cured as I have not
felt any symptoms since. Had tried al-
most all remedies that I heard of that
were good for dyspepsia, but without reÂ»
lief. Finally I became discouraged an<f
wÂ«>te to you for advice, with the abov*
result."

WOULD COMPEL
REDS TO FARM
Governor of Arizona
Favors the Sale of
Reservations.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â Governor
Murphy of Arizona in his annual report
advocates the sale and settlement of the
large Indian reservations within the Ter
ritory, with the possible exception of the
Navajo reservation in Northeastern Ari
zona, and the Government construction of
reservoirs for water storage for irrigation
in suitable localities, with canals leading
to lands allotted to the Indians. The
Governor says the latter action, in which
Indian labor could be largely utilized,
would help to make farmers of the Indi
ans. He declares that further mainten
ance of the tribal relations as now con
ducted and the retention of reservation
agencies around which the Indians clus
ter and live in idleness on Government
rations seriously retard the civilization of
the Indians.
A number of localities in the Territory
are dissatisfied with the census returns,
and the Government alleges that the
greatest injustice was done to Phoenix
the capital, in fixing its population at
544 only. Its registration for the city
election last May, he claims, indicated a
population this year of at least 10,000. He
attributes the discrepancy in the figures
to enumeration in the summer, when the
people were at summer resorts, and to
careless work of enumerators. He says
from the school census and other reliable
sources the population of the Territory is
now at least 135,000, against the census
returns of 122,012.
Within the last decade 545 miles of canal
have been constructed at a cost of $1,508,
469, and irrigated land has increased
19,595 acres.

TACOMA. Wash., Nov. 10â The Jap

propriation for this purpose, but the naval
department has now obtained funds from
other sources. The plant will be in work

COALING DEPOTS
IN EVERY ZONE
American Vessels Need
Use No Foreign
FueL
Stations So Located That Our
Cruisers May Circumnavi
gate the Globe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N. W.,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â Coaling sta
tions and coal supplies have been estab
lished by Rear Admiral Bradford, chief
of bureau of equipment of the Navy De
partment, to such an extent tnat a vessel
of the United States navy could steam
around the world and use nothing but
American owned coal. In time of war it
would not be possible for an American
warship ;o oDtain coal belonging to this
Government at European ports because of
the necessity of the observance of neu
trality by the European nations, and be
cause of the jealousy of Europe to the
presence of American vessels. Because of
that condition no action will be taken by !
this Government- looking to the acquisition j
of coaling station sites in Europe, but
Rear Admiral Bradford has carefully
formed plans for the establishment of
coaling stations on the South American
Continent, and, when they are established,
an American warship will have no ditfl
culty in obtaining fuel in all parts of the
world save Europe.
In his annual report just made public.
Rear Admiral Bradford says:
"As the department is aware, efforts are
being made to establish other naval coal
depots at important localities, which it is
deemed unwise to discuss in a report of a
public character."
Millions Paid for Coal.
A striking illustration of the growth of
the American navy is presented in the
single statement in the report of Rear Ad
miral Bradford that he spent $2,273,111 last
fiscal year for 324,108 tons of coal at an
average cost of $7 01 per ton. The report
says that this was nearly 95,713 more tons
of coal than was used during the preced
ing fiscal year. Ten years ago the coal
consumption was 73,000 tons per annum.
Admiral Bradford has scattered Ameri
can coal all over the world, wherever suit
able storage could be found. He has
placed 12,000 tons at Yokohama and 5,000
at Pichilique, Mexico, and he has sent
large quantities to Guam and to tne Phil
ippines. He carried 9000 tons by water
from the Atlantic Coast to Mare Island,
Cal., where it came into competition with
English Cardiff coal. They have averaged
the same in cost, viz.: $9 29 per ton, but
at present, owing to the scarcity of Amer
ican freight vessels, the best Cardiff coal
is considerably cheaper at Mare Island. It
is recommended that two large steam
10,000 ton colliers be built to keep depots
supplied in time of peace and to accom
pany the fleets in time of war.
Summarizing the work accomplished at
various coaling stations during the year
the report takes up Cavite and says that
the bureau is about to open bids for a
45,000 ton coaling station there. Efforts
have been made to obtain a site for a
coaling station at Cebu. but thus far with
out success. Coaling stations have been
located at Port Isabella and at Polloo,
Mindanao. A complete station has been
established at Yokohama, Japan, and It is
now fully stocked with coal.
Cable Surveys Are Completed.
Admiral Bradford says very little about
his favorite project In a trans-Pacific sub
marine telegraph cable, contenting himself
with the statement that the bureau is
now in possession of all data required, so
far as surveys are concerned, to lay this
cable. In the same connection he renews
his recommendation for a careful exam
ination of the Pacific Ocean, west of the
Hawaiian Islands, to locstte dangers to
navigation. He recommends that addi
tional hydrographic offices be established
at Manila and at Pensacola, Fla.
The report says that the nubject of
wireless telegraphy has been followed
carefully during the year, but it does not
appear advisable to adopt any particular
system at present, or to acquire any more
apparatus than necessary for purposes of
Instruction. It is clear that no system has
as yet passed beyond the experimental
stage.
RUN DELIGHTS
THE FARMERS
Storm in Many Sections
Brings Manifold
Benefits.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10.â The rain which
was threatening all day yesterday com
menced falling this morning at 5 o'clock
and kept coming in showers all day long.
The total precipitation amounted to .37 of
an inch, making .67 for the season. Re
ports from the country show that the rain
was general but not heavy. It extended
as far south on the peninsula as Ensen
ada. There was no damage done to hay
and grain and raisins are all housed. An
other rain of about double the fall would
start plows going all over the county.
Orchards are vastly improved, at least in
appearance, by the showers.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â Rain began
falling at Los Angeles about 2 a. m. to
day and showers fell at intervals from
that time until 2 p. m., when the weather
cleared somewhat. To-night it is cool and
partly cloudy, with wind indications that
the rain is over for the present. The total
rainfall for the storm was .46 of an inch,
making a total for the season of 2.46
inches. The rain was general in this sec
tion.
MONTEREY, Nov. 10.â Nearly half an
inch of rain fell here last night and ad
vices from outlying districts show the
downpour was general and nearly uniform
in quantity throughout the district. The
farmers are pleased and predict a good
year.
MERCED, Nov. 10.â This section has
been visited by a steady rainfall of twelve
hours' duration, the precipitation being
over three-fourths of an inch and making
the total for the season nearly two inches.
A large amount of summer fallow seeding
has been done in this county and the pres
ent storm will enable farmers to begin
winter plowing and seeding, besides being
of great benefit to grazing land.
WOODLAND, Nov. 10,-There has been
sufficient rainfall to enable Tolo County
farmers to seed their summer fallowed
land and put it in fine condition. Winter
plowing will begin soon and the area sown
to wheat will probably be as large as
usual. The shipment of table grapes to
the East closed last week. The crop was
good and prices throughout the season
have been satisfactory. The wine grape
crop while not so large as usual has been
very profitable.
SAN MIGUEL, Nov. 10.â The second
rain of this season, which began falling
last evening, will prove a great blessing
to this section. Since the last storm the
green grass has sprung up so that stock
of all kinds are doinp well. Up to 7
o'clock this morning .29 of an inoh of
rain hap fallen making a total for the
season thus far of 1.17 inches, against
.60 of an inch the same date last year
FRESNO, Nov. 10.â A heavy rain fell
In Fresno this morning, the total pre
cipitation being .53 of an inch. It will
not only do pood but will cause much
improvement in pastures and make pos
sible the immediate commencing of plow
ing.
Boy Makes Target of Ppssers-By.
DEVIL'S LAKE. N. D., Nov. 10.â The
6-year-old son of William Barber passed
the time to-day shooting with a revolver
at persons passing his home. Miles Mil
ler, a merchant, was made a target of by
the boy, but was missed. Burt Crary, a
12-year-old boy, was shot through the
lung and probably fatally wounded. The
Barber boy seemed to think he was hav
ing a good time.
RUMOR THAT BRIGANDS HAVE KILLED
MISS STONE IS CREDITED IN SOFIA
American Consul General Dickinson Reproaches Bulgarian Au
thorities With Having Embarrassed Negotiations and Placed
Lives of the Missionary and Her Companion in Jeopardy
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â Tho World has the following from Sofia: There is a persistent rumor
here that Ellen M. Stone, the American woman missionary, who, together with her Bible reader, Mrs.
Tsilka, has been a captive in the hands of brigands nearly ten weeks, is dead. The American diplomatic
agent here, Charles M. Dickinson, who has been tireless in his efforts to rescue Miss Stone and is even now
in communication with her captors, is incredulous; yet many here believe the report because it is known
that Yanne Sandansky, the brigand chief, lately threatened to kill her, ransom or no ransom.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Nov. 10.â Infor- ,
mation has been received here
from Doubnltza that the band of
brigands holding captive Miss
Ellen M. Stone, the American
missionary, called about a fortnight ago
at the village of Smetchevo and subse
quently proceeded to the monastery of
Rllo but the movements of the troops
compelled the brigands to flee toward the
frontier, where they are now in hiding.
It is also asserted that the brigands
have recently been treating Miss Stone
with more severity, in order to exercise
pressure and to compel a more ready ac
ceptance of their conditions.

IRELAND'S HOPES
GROW BRIGHTER
Irish Envoys in Dramatic
Speech Tell of Her
Noble Aims.
BOSTON, Nov. 10.â Ireland's hopes and
alms were told in dramatic language to
8000 men and women in Mechanics' Hall
to-night by the Irish envoys, Hon. John
P Redmond, Hon. M. A. McHugh and
Hon. Thomas O'Donnell. The gathering
was directed by the United Irish League,
and the presiding officer was William
Lloyd Garrison. His address was well in
keeping with the sentiment of the even
ing. He said in part:
The element of justice, nerving: the outraged
champions of liberty to heroic deed* is au
ally more potent than ships and regiments
in "Khaki.
The uprising in South Africa and the Philip
pines, both now extending into years, have
baffled short-sighted statesmen who looked for
their subsidence In a few weeks.
Ireland and South Africa, common victims
of English wrongs, are separated by wide seas
and the barrier of language. Happily the
sturdy burghers of the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State are able to speak with
Irish lips in the House of Commons with un
compromising effectiveness. It is to the honor
and glory of Ireland that in this crisis
her representative sons have stood as a bulwark
for freedom.
Garrison expressed the hope that anti-
English demonstrations in this country
will be Intelligently directed against the
real enemy, the autocratic and plutocratic
class now holding political control in Eng
land, and that general recognition will
be made of that better England, termed
pro-Boer and traitors, typified by John
Morley, Frederick Harrison, John Burns,
Miss Emily Hobhouse and Dr. Spence
Watson.
Redmond said he and his colleagues had
come to America to proclaim three
things:
First, the enmity of the Irish race.
Second, to explain the policy of the
United Irish League.
Third, to ask for the moral and the ma
terial support of the Irish race in Amer
ica, from their descendants and the Amer
ican people themselves.
O'Donnell, in the course of his remarks,
said that Ireland to-day is an Irish Ire
land, whose sons respect her past, respect
and value her products and bar every
thing that comes from England. In con
clusion the speaker said: *
We are not cowardly enough to make any
statement in this fcee republic that we would
not make in Ireland or in the House of Com
mons. We should be unworthy of freedom did
we counsel the submission to intolerable
wrongs. We have not come to preach any
such doctrines.
I appeal to Irish parents in America to do
their duty to cultivate an Irish national senti
ment and to instruct their children in the his
tory of our beloved country.
McHugh spoke on the bright outlook for
the Irish people, and said they must fol
low the policy of Parnell.
Rev. Arthur J. Teeling of Linn intro
druced a series of resolutions, which were
unanimously adopted, indorsing the plan
of the United Irish League as outlined by
Redmond, and promising moral and finan
cial support for the movement.
The guests were escorted to the hall
from the Bellevue Hotel by seven com
panies of the Ninth Regiment, M. N. G.
GIVES RICHES AWAY
AND WANTS THEM BACK
Court Decides That a Washington
Man Has Lost All Title
to Property.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 10.â Four years
ago Andrew Jackson of Centralia deeded
ai". his property to William Huen and
wife, Mrs. Huen being Jackson's daugh
ter. Jackson had recently lost his wife
when this happened and believed that
would not livj long. He desired his
daughter to have everything he pos
sessed and followed up L.s real estate
conveyances by placing in her hands his
valuable papers and other chattels.
This summer Jackson came to the con
clusion that he still had a considerable
time to live. He met and wooed a hand
some woman younger than himself and
set up another establishment. He then
applied to his daughter and her husband
fo Â¦ the property he had given them. They
did not wish to reconvey it and declined
point blank when pressed on the subject.
Jackson thought he had a clear case and
went into court.
The Superior Court has just decided
that his real estate conveyances were
absolute and the property cannot be re
covered. Another suit has been insti
tuted with the object of regaining pos
session of his former personal property.
In return for his gifts Jackson's relatives
were to take care of him during his re
maining days, and they argue that they
have always been willing to carry out
their part of the agreement.
STRIKES RICH ORE
WHEN DIGGING A WEJLL
Glenn County Farmer Finds a Gold
Mine When Searching Â£ot
Water.
GERMANTOWN, Nov. 10.â That the
hills in Western Glenn County contain
gold in paying quantities there appears
to be no doubt. Last week John Blum
quist decided to dig his well deeper that
he might obtain a more abundant supply
of water. He had dug but a few feet
when he came upon a peculiar quartz
formation resembling lead.
Those who saw the rock advised Blum
qulst to send it to San Francisco for as
say. He did so, and his returns state
that the quartz will run $3 50 in gold. $1 40
in silver and 70 cents in nickel. Blum
qulst has since taken out rock fully twice
as rich as that which was assayed. The
farm on which this was found is situated
in the foothills in the southwestern part
of Glenn County in a little valley lying
parallel with and between Clark and
Stony Creek valleys, near what is known
as the Pierson grade.
State Secretary to Fig-nt a Duel.
HAVANA, Nov. 10.â The papers an
nounced that Senor Tamayo, Secretary of
State and Government, has been chal
lenged to fight a duel by a member of the
Union Club whom, it is said, Senor Tam
ayo and a friend assaulted at the close
of the recent banquet given by the Cuban
Society to the visiting Chileans. Senor
Tamayo was detained by the police but
ultimately released by the Civil Governor.
Consul General Dickinson is inflexible.
He insists that the surrender of Miss
Stone must precede, or be simultaneous
with, the payment of the ransom. His
attitude is justified by the known deter
mination of some of the members of the
band, particularly the captain, Yanne
Sandsky, to kill Miss Stone and her com
panion as soon as the ransom is received,
owing to the fact that the captives have
now acquired information concerning the
secret committees.
Competent persons, however, express
the opinion that the cupidity of the brig
ands will overcome their fear of revela
tions, and all such approve the declara
tion of Mr. Dickinson.

Yesterday Mr. Dickinson made energetic
representations to the Bulgarian Govern
ment against the movement of the Bulga
rian troops, reproaching the officials with
the fact that, notwithstanding their sol
emn promise to give him all assistance in
their power, their action was embarrass
ing the negotiations, retarding a settle
ment and placing in jeopardy the life of
Miss Stone. He made a definite declara
tion that the Bulgarian Government
would be held responsible for the death
of Miss Stone, and of all the conse
quences of her death, should it be
proved that the attitude of the Bulgarian
Government forced the brigands to kill
their captives.

STRONG LOBBY
AIDING CHINESE
Fighting Against Re-en
e Coment of Exclusion
Law.
Friends of the Measure Have
Strong Champion in the
President
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 10.â The Journal has
the following from Washington: The
Presi-dent, the Secretary of the Treasury
and immigration officials favor the re
enactment of the Chinese exclusion law,
which expires on May 5, 1902, and not
withstanding reports inspired by the lob
by already at work in Washington that
the law will be allowed to die the strong
est reasons exist for believing that the
so-called Geary law, or an act framed
along the same lines, will be passed at
the coming session.
Railroad interests have combined with
some manufacturing and mining interests
to fight against the re-enactment of tho
exclusion law, and a powerful lobby is be
ing formed for this purpose. Secretary
Gage has denied the statement that he
was not in favor of exclusion. Commis
sioner Powderly and other treasury of
ficials heartily favor the retention of the
law.
Labor leaders Â¦who have seen President
Roosevelt report that he is strongly la

OCTOBER A RECORD BREAKER.
TRADE conditions last week continued fully as
flattering as at any time during the past four
or five years. It is surprising Jiow the tide of
prosperity keeps up. There is no sign of a break
anywhere. The country is full of money and enor
mous exploitations of capital are carried through
with a success which >vould have dazzled financiers of
lest than a quarter of a century ago. And the best of
it is that they are mainly legitimate enterprises, de
signed for permanence, with a view to the payment
of food dividends for years to come, wholly non
speculative and resulting in lasting benefitAo the com
munities where they are established. We have lately
had an instance of this in our own city in the pur
chase of the Market street and other railroad sys
tems by a huge Eastern syndicate. These vast finan
cial operations could not be accomplished unless the
whole country was highly prosperous.
The weekly bank clearings reflected the general
condition of trade. The gain for the week was 28.4
per cent over the same week last year, and of the
eighty and more cities reporting their clearings only
four, and these small places, reported a loss. This
record is surprising, but it has happened more than
once during the past several years. The failures were
191, against 161 for the same week last year, but they
were generally unimportant.
The leading commercial staples, with one or two
exceptions, continue to make a fine showing. It goes
without saying that the iron and steel trade is active,
hut it is still hampered by the scarcity of cars. The
woolen mills are. all engaged to their full capacity
and stocks of goods are so reduced that the manu
facturers have lately been obliged to make heavy pur
chases of raw material. The South is holding back its
cotton, being led to this course by the general bullish
tendency in business all over the country. The ap
pearance of winter temperatures throughout the East
and West has stimulated clothing, groceries and other
common lines of merchandise to such a degree that
jobbers everywhere have increased their orders.
Wheat, too, is at last rising, and is more buoyant all
over the world, with larger buying at great market
centers. Hides and leather are quoted strong, with
active markets, and so on down the whole list of
staple goods, if provisions and dried fruit be ex
cepted. the two latter lines being quieter and more
or less weak in all positions. The shipping trade is
reported in fine condition, more high class vessels
being under construction than ever before, while the
demand for vessels is still lively.
The condition of trade in San Francisco is re
jected by the showing of the export business of the
port during the month of October. The volume ex
ceeded that of September by over $3,000,000, and that
of October, 1000, by $1,292,000, the latter having pre
sly been the record month, while the figures last
month were $3,000,000 over the average of the past
twelve months. These figures tell the commercial
story of the port.
The current rise in wheat is a good thing for this
State, for there is a large supply of that grain here,
and if it brings pood prices the circulation of money
among the farmers and merchants will be increased
by millions. When wheat does well everything else
it apt to be prospt^pus. so the outlook is bright. The
other staples, such as wool, hides, live stock, wines,
l>eans, canned goods of all kinds, etc., are quoted firm
and in steady outward movement, the only lines show
ing dullness at the moment being provisions, hops
Â¦ dried fruits. The city and country banks report
large funds on hand, and solvent borrowers find no
difficulty in getting all the accommodation they want
-easonable rates of interest. The city and State
were never in better commercial condition than they
to-day. I
hi dealing with the Sultan the French continue to
It polite, but they insist that their taking ways shail
â¢ ermitted to include the taking of Turkish cus
tom* wherever they tan pick them up.
FUTURE GOLD SUPPLY.
SOME time ago Professor Shaler of Harvard
Was reported to have said in a lecture that im
proved processes of working gold mines of all
sorts have so cheapened the cost of producing the
metal that it would ere long be so abundant as to be
hardly Available for monetary uses. Professor Shaler
promptly denied having made such a statement, but
at the same time declined to inform the public of his
views on the subject. He has now contributed to the
I International Monthly an article on "The Future of
j the Gold Supply," which, while not so sensational as
! the statements attributed to him, is nevertheless
I something like a confirmation of the essential features
of the report.
The professor points out that gold is one of the
most widely diffused of metals. It exists almost every
where but rarely in paying quantities. Thus he says:
"While it may be said that wherever a person may
b e on the surface of the earth, or on the ocean, there
j is likely to be enough gold within a mile of his feet
j to- make him a millionaire, the places where gold can
conceivably be won at a profit are relatively few."
There are three situations in which gold is found
under conditions that render it profitable to work
the fields. First, the lodes or veins in which gold has
been deposited commonly in association with other
metals; second, the accumulation of detritus arising
from the decay of rocks containing gold; and, third,
the deposits containing gold formed like the second
class, but which have been brought beneath the sea,
deeply covered by strata, and have thus been sub
jected to influences that have greatly changed their
character.
Professor Shaler discusses the prospective output
of each of the three kinds of gold fields in turn. He
notes that in working the lodes and veins of gold in
the rocks, there have been such improvements in the
methods that at present it does not cost one-third
as much to win and treat a given amount of ore
from an underground mine as it did in 1850. By rea
son of the increased efficiency of the processes of
such mining, and making no allowance for future im
provements, he estimates that the yield from that
group of gold deposits is likely within twenty yea r s
to exceed $500,000,000 per annum and to be main
tained at that or a greater rate for many decades.
In the working of the gravel or alluvial deposits
equally great improvements have been made, notably
in New Zealand, where a dredge has been devised
which Tenders it profitable to work alluvial gravels
that were wholly unprofitable a few years ago. In
addition to the alluvial fields already being exploited,
it is believed new fields will be found and opened
up along the whole Pacific Coast from Alaska to
Patagonia, in'the northern part of South America, in
the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama, in Siberia and
in many parts of China. The professor says: "It is
indeed not improbable that in twenty years from the
present time the annual production from this source
may exceed that which is now contributed from all
the existing mines." He adds: "This, be it said, is
but an opinion, and is of no value as an estimate."
The third group of gold deposits is found mainly
in California and South Africa. The professor says:
"Owing to the fact that such deposits may have a
horizontal extent vastly greater than that of any
vein, their possible importance as a source of supply
becomes evident. That of the Rand, if such it be, is
fairly reckoned as certain to yield more than two
billion dollars. As nature repeats itself with what
seems to be a love of so doing, we may fairly assume
that the discovery of other like deposits will reward
those keen-eyed and indcfatigible searchers for the
treasures of the under earth who are now afoot in
all lands."
As to the result. Professor Shaler holds that the
output of gold will continue to increase until the
metal becomes so cheap it will no longer pay profits
on the operation. He adds: "It is clear, however,
that much disturbance of values would be brought
about before this automatic brake could be operated.
All debts, though their face value would be un
changed, would be as effectively scaled down as
though a despot had for his profit debased the coin
age of the civilized world."
Professor Shaler has no remedy for what he calls
"this apparent danger." The world, however, we be
lieve, will hardly be alarmed by the professor's views.
Should the supply of gold become so abundant as to
materially lessen its value, there would grow up an
increasing demand for it in India and China and in
South America. In short, there seems no reason to
fear that the world will ever have occasion to regret
having adopted gold as the standard of value.
Mr. Winston Churchill in addressing his constit
uents a few days ago said the South African war "has
ceased to be a supreme issue and become an unmiti
gated nuisance"; all of which may be so, but the sad
truth remains that it is just as hard for Kitchener to
abate the nuisance as it was for him to settle the
issue.
AN EARTH TELEPHONE.
SOME time ago dispatches from London con
tained a brief announcement of certain experi
ments made in England for the purpose of
demonstrating the feasibility of sending wireless mes
sages through the earth as well as through the air.
British papers have now been received giving de
tailed accounts of the experiments, and from their re
ports it appears the new telegraphy, or "earth tele
phone," as they call it, may ere long be in practical
operation.
The London Chronicle in reporting the experi
ments says the inventors of the system, Tarbottan
Armstrong and Axel Orling, have found that it is
possible to' start the electricity of the earth into waves
by a slight and almost imperceptible impulse, and
any number of the waves thus started can be picked
up and made to deflect a needle or agitate the re
ceiver of a telephone.
The report then goes on to say: "A small battery
(fitted with the ordinary apparatus for transmitting
the Morse code) and a telephone transmitter
were put up in a small shed. A thousand yards
away there was another shed fitted with re
ceivers for both code and telephone. Mes
sages were sent, and a conversation was held
through the solid earth. The only apparatus was the
transmitters and receivers, and a bar of iron driven
six feet into the ground outside each shed. The whole
cost of the apparatus would be Â£5 or Â£6. So
far it has been found to work up to distances of three
or four miles. But this is not all. Our discoverers
have found that their current can be sent through
water as well as land. At a distance of a thousand
yards a model torpedo was steered by means of an
electric current that passed through both air and
water. There was something uncanny in seeing the
rudder moved at will by no visible agency."
The results of the experiments appear like marvels
indeed, but it is very well known that many an inven
tion works successfully in purely experimental tests,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1901.
but fails to satisfy the requirements of practical work
in the world. Something further, therefore, will have
to be done by the inventors of the new telegraphy
before the world will accept it as a feasible system.
At present it can be looked upon only as a thing of
promise. The inventors themselves have of course
high expectations of it. They have coined a word
from the first syllable of each of their names and
given to the system the name "Armorl." They claim
that ships fitted with their apparatus can communi
cate with one another for a distance of fifteen miles,
and that lighthouses and lightships can send or re
ceive messages over an equal distance.
In some respects the earth messages promise even
more than the Marconi system of telegraphing
through the air. The store of electricity in the earth
is enormous, and should there be developed a practi
cal way of making use of it, we might eventually em
ploy it not for telegraphing only but for lighting and
fcven for motive power.
It is announced that the title of the lecture Sarah
Grand is delivering in the East is "Mere Man," and
it is hardly necessary to add that according to the
reports the audiences are mainly composed of women
who doubtless wish to learn all they can about the
"mereness" of the brute.
FOR many a year past Nevada has seemed to
casual observers to be a decadent State. East
ern people acquired a habit of referring to it as
"a mining camp." Sometimes they called it "a politi
cal rotten borough." As a rule they. believed it to be
a land whose mineral resources are exhausted and
which has nothing else to rely upon for the acquire
ment of wealth and the support of an increasing popu
lation.
Those who have shared that opinion will now have
to change it. The strong 1 and energetic men who
have stayed with Nevada have discovered new
sources of mineral wealth, and these promise to yield
even more abundantly than those whose exploitation
were the wonder of the world in days gone by. Dili
gent prospectors have brought to light several"dis
tricts where the yield of gold is promising in the
highest degree, and, as a consequence, new mining
enterprises are being undertaken with capital suf
ficient to carry them to success.
Nor is it in mining only that the energies of the
people of Nevada are developing new fields for profit
able industry. By reason of the extension of irriga
tion, many districts of the State that formerly pro
duced nothing but sage brush are now marked by
fields of alfalfa, farms and orchards. The live
stock industry thrives. It is not so extensive as it was
in times past, but it is now adapting itself to new
conditions, and in the end, with the extension of irri
gation and the increased production of grasses of one
kind or another, it will eventually be larger than ever.
The new activity of the State finds full develop
ment at Reno, which is now one of the most attrac
tive and wealthy cities of its size in the Union, and
has entered upon something like a new era in its his
tory. The State University has an attendance which
attests the desire of the youth of the commonwealth
for higher education and their ability to attain it. In
fact, whether considered with respect to her mines,
her cattle, her farms, her cities, her business or her
educational institutions, Nevada is capable of making
a good showing for herself.
In times past the wealth of Nevada was taken
away to build up other States, but the new wealth
seems to be in the hands of men who love the State,
who intend to live there and who will use it to build up
Nevada herself. Such being the case, it is not easy
to set limits to the changes which may be wrought
in the conditions of Nevada life within the next ten
years. Many an Eastern man who has been taught
to look upon the State as no better than an exhausted
mining camp may yet seek it as a place for the in
vestment of his money and find there so many at
tractions that he will settle there permanently and
become as big a Nevada boomer as any of those who
have lived there for forty years or are native to the
soil.
The New Orleans Times-Democrat has sprung
upon the country a new problem or puzzle that may
be worth studying just to pass the time away. It says
in reference to the State Insane Asylum: "Why is
it that while among the whites the men constitute
more than twice as many lunatics as the women, the
reverse is true of the negroes, the colored female
lunatics in the asylum being exactly twice as many
as the male negroes?" Any man who can answer the
question will please send the explanation direct to
the Times-Democrat. We have troubles of our own.
Anarchists are bad people and lynchers are bad
people, but what are we to say of criminals of the
type of the professional nurse who is charged in
Massachusetts with poisoning four patients whom she
was employed to nurse, and who is suspected of other
poisonings? It looks like a case where a woman
having been taught to handle poisons deliberately
made use of the knowledge to put people to death,
not from malice or hope of gain, but merely for the
pleasure of exercising her skill in administering
poison. '
According to a report from Berlin the Kaiser, when
attending the dedication of a church at Konigsberg,
surprised the congregation by delivering the prayer
himself, and it is said "it was most eloquent and
'would have done credit to an archbishop." As the
Kaiser had already established a reputation as an
orator, preacher, painter, poet, musician, sailor,
sportsman and all round dresser, there would seem
now to be nothing left for him to do except to take
tothe prize ring or try to elevate the stage.
The fact that an lowa farmer even at this early
period of the fall has been found frozen to death in
a cornfield within a few hundred yards of his home
shows what kind of a climate they have over there.
Husking corn in lowa appears to be about as cold a
job as hunting for gold at Cape Nome.
The campaign investigations of the crookedness of
Tammany Hall have brought to light the fact that in
some departments of the city the names- of dead men

the entire subject of destroyers, but ;>
the meantime the navy authorities do no;,

Another British destroyer, the Brazen.
has become disabled and forced to aban
don her cruise in the north seas on ac
count of leaky boiler tubes. Accidents
by collision, running ashore, foundering
and repairs to engines and boilers have
become too frequent since the advent of
these frail crafts with excessive horse
power, and all naval powers except Grea:
Britain have teased building thirty-knot
boats.

nine birchings were inflicted under sen

There are now three admirals In the
German navy, Prince Heinrich of Prus
sia being the latest promotion to that
grade. He entered the navy in 1877, was
promoted to staff officer in 1888 and to
"captain at sea" in IS9O. serving in th-3
latter capacity in four ships. In 1896 he
became a rear admiral, and December 5,
1899, vice admiral. Although his promo
tion has been rapid as compared win
that of other officers in the navy not of
royal blood, he has had considerable ac
tive service and is considered an efficient
officer, fully versed in all the details of
his profession, and a good authority on
naval architecture, ordnance and kindred
subjects. The other two admirals are Yon
Koester, with patent of 18&7, and Thomp
son of 1899.
The growth cf the personnel In the
German navy from April, 1900, up to one
year later is as follows:

Gunnery practice is receiving much at
tention of late in foreign navies, notably
in the French and Engl'sh. In the lattei
the conditions for heavy and light guns
are different, the target used for the 12
inch and 9.2-inch guns being fifteen feat
high, twenty feet across the top and flft/
feet at the foot. The vessels steam past
this target at eight knots' speed at dis
tances varying from 1400 to 2000 yards,
firing for a pariod of six minutes. Tha
six-Inch quick-firers fire for two minutes
over a range varying from 1400 to 160")
yards at a target of 300 square feet, thj
ships moving at twelve knots' speed. Un
der the first named conditions the cruiser
Terrible fired her two 3.2-inch guns twen
ty-two rounds and scored fourteen hits, a
percentage of 64.

EKBERG'S CRUEL
SLAYER KNOWN
Police Confident They
Will Land Him in
Prison.
Arrest of the Assassin Is
Expected at Any
Moment.
The brutal murderer of Otto Ekberg, the
non-union teamster, who was slain at
Third and Townsend streets Saturday
evening, is known to the police and his
arrest is expected at any moment. Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour and his men,
hilt refusing to reveal the name of the
assassin, declare that he cannot possibly
escape. P.egarding the crime. Captain
Seymour said:
1 am *atlsfif d that we know Ekberg's mur
derer. Who he is 1 refuse to Bay until he is"
t>afe in prison. In my opinion the murder of
Ekberg was one of the loulest in the criminal
annals of San Francisco. Since the'commis
sion of the awful crime I have had my men
Investigating every possible clew which might
lead to the apprehension of the brutal mur
derer. â¢ â¢; â¢ : -
From our investigations I am satisfied that
we know the man vi ho killed Ekberg. Unless
something unforeseen happens he wilt be behind
prison bars. before many hours. â¢ Â¦ â¢',Â¦â¢'
, Ekberg, since the strike, had been work
ing for the Nolan Drayage and Warehouse
; Company. Several days ago he informed
one of his friends that he had noticed' a
man following him. but thinking he was
some crank he paid little attention to him.
Before leaving the barn of his employer
â¢Saturday evening . Ekberg, who was
known as a game fellow, examined his
revolver, after remarking to one of his
fellow workers that he was taking "no
chances." He had left the barn only a
lew minutes when his murderous assail-
S ant sneaked up behind him and dealt him
the fatal blow.
j The fact that the murderer turned
over the body of his victim and gazed
upon his face with a satisfied smile
convinced the police that vengeance alone
prompted the awful crime.. Ekberg, prior
to accepting; a position with the Nolan
Drayage Company, worked for W. P.
Fuller as a teamster. This was during
the strike. Ekberg lived at 512 Bush
street at the time and on several occa
sions he was attacked by union men, but
always managed to escape unhurt. Short
ly before the strike was settled he and a
companion, while walKing along Grant
avenue, were attacked by a gang of men
and several shots fired at them. Ekberg
and his friend, who was also a non-union
teamster, returned the fire, wounding one
of the attacking party in the leg.
The piece of gas pipe the murderer used
in killing his victim was turned over to
Coroner Leland yesterday. He will hold
an inquest on the body to-day.

Rev. Mr. Mills' subject was '"The Song of

music and song to the free religious
spirit, and also how a truly liberal re
ligion contributes to the welfare and

Jones Did Not Hang Himself.
Frederick W. Jones, who lives at the

strf-c-t*, called at the Morgue yesterday
and assured the deputies that he had not
hanged himself in the park last Friday.
He was very indignant at Harry Ward
for stating that he was the man who had
committed suicide, and declared that he
did not know Ward. Jones used to be
second officer on the Ventura. It Is now
thought that tho body is that of J. D.
Sceed of Fisk Mills. Sonoma County, who
disappeared from there about a week
ago. The initials "J. D. S." were in the
hat worn by the dead man.

REWARDS THE CHIEF
Announcement Is Made That John E. Sulli
van Is to Be Reappointed as Head of
the Polxe Department at the Capital
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 10.â Mayor
George H. Clark has announced
his Intention to reappoint John E,
Sullivan in January next as Chief
of Police of Sacramento.
For two years Sullivan has served as
head of the local police department, and
during that time has won the commenda
tion and resoect of the public. Even In
the bitterness of the recent political cam
paign his conduct of the affairs of his
department did not become the subject of
attack, and the opinion is general that
Chief Sullivan has given the city one of
the best police administrations it has ever
had.
During his term the department has
been singularly free from scandal, and the
personal honfr and integrity of the chief ,
have never been questioned. His discip
line of the force under his command has
been excellent and his treatment of those
having dealing? with the department has
been uniformly fair arid courteous.
SOUTH AMERICAN LINE TO EXTEND,
ITS SERVICE TO PUGET SOUND PORTS
The Pacific Steam Navigation Compa
ny's Peru arrived from North and Central
American ports yesterday. She made a
good run, but while docking at Howard
street wharf No. 3 she was caught by the
flood tide and carried down upon the
transport Grant, lying at Folsom street.
The latter vessel lost her jackstaff and
her sign boards, besides a portion of her
"gingerbread work." The whole damage
did not amount to ?25 and was due to no
fault of those aboard the Peru.
The mail boat did not bring up a big
passenger list nor much cargo. Of the
latter there Is only about 200 tons, while
there were only twelve people In the
cabin, three in the 'steerage and fourteen
Chinese in transit for Hongkong. Those
who came up in the cabin were: H. H.
Sawyer, Minerva W Norris, M. A. Nor
rie, Thomas T. Taylor, Ruby Cross,
George Sharpe. Edith Sharpe, George H.
Bartlett, flufus D. Morris, E. H. de Bring
loff and Frank A. Elliott.
George Sharpe is the general manager
of the Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany, and comes here in connection with
the extension of the company's business.
It Is the Intention as soon as the new
steamships now being built are ready for
service that they will run to Puget Sound
and there make connection with the Can
adian Pacific Railroad. The first of the
fleet, the Victoria, is now nearing com
pletion, and on her maiden voyage will
run from England to the sound via the
Straits of Magellan, Valparaiso (her home
port). Central American ports and San
Francisco. On the return trip this will
be her port of final departure from the
UnHed States.
All details in connection with the new
system will be attended to by Mr. Sharpe
while he is on the coast. He is accom
panied by his daughter.
While the Poru lay in the Panama road
stead there was a sound of cannonading
from the shore. Later investigation an<l
the reports of the passengers who came
over the isthmus showed that it was only
a skirmish lasting about an hour. Much
powder was wasted, but nobody was
hurt.
NO MORE STORM SIGNALS.
Mariners Will Watch Mills Building
in Vain This Winter.
Throughout the winter no storm signals
will be shown on the Mills building, nor
from the chief wharfinger's office. The
Weather Bureau says that according to
the regulations no flags will be flown be
cause the prognostications are published
every morning in the dally papers. The
shipmasters reason, however, that, par
ticularly in San - rancisco, an hour may
cause a change of barometer, and also
a change of wind, and a southeaster or
norther may easily come up unannounced
in the papers. The first thing in the morn
ing the mariner looks to the flag poles on
the Mills building or the chief wharfing
er's office, and when he sees no signal
there he is satisfied there is no danger.
In the meantime, however, a gale may be
brewing, and at the last moment he has
to hurry up and make his ship safe.
Throughout the coming winter the Gov
ernment should most assuredly make pro
vision to fly the flagp showing the, fore
cast for fair or foul weather.

FOOTPAD GANG
INFESTS THE CITY
Hold-Ups Are Reported
From Various Sec
tions of Town.
Police Ofi|cers Striving to
Catch '$he Bold High
waymen.
The Police ijepartment is using every
effort to roundj up the gang of footpads
at present investing the city, and or
ders have been issued *>y the heads of
departments that the highwaymen must
caught.
The approach of winter has driven a
number of. desperate characters Into the
city, and for tne past month many hold
ups have been reported to the police. I
Five of the th Qgs were caught a week ago
and are now awaiting trial, and Captain ,
of Detectives Seymour hopes to be abte :
to increase th# number by further arrests. |
Early yesterday morning footpads were j
reported operating in various parts of the ;
city. Eugene C. Strachaur, an employe |
of the Penntagton Steel Works, reported
to Police Qilicer Cullinane that he I
had been held up at 4 a. m. on Eddy
street, between Jones and Leavenworth. .
Be was robbed of a gold watch and some \
trinkets. Strachaur described the robbers j
as a "tall ai#d a short man." The tail
man was about 5 feet 7 Inches in height,
had dark hale and moustache and was
dressed In a dark cutaway suit, black
Fedora hat and negligee shirt. The sec
ond man could not be described.
No- trace hÂ£.s been found of the robbers
who at 1 a. m. yesterday attacked H.
Roman and his son in front of their
home, 1180 CFarrell street. It was lucky
for the Romans that the robbers' pistols
failed to go off.
W. R. laddie, who was held up by two
robbers on Hayes street, near the Me
chanics' Pavilion, at 2:30 o'clock .yester
day mÂ»rnin:j, and who was subsequently
sent to the Emergency Hospital by po
licemen who ran to his assistance, is out
again, not having been badly hurt.
On the water front hold-ups have been
frequent.
James Giillece, a, saloon-keeper of 31
Ninth street, claims that he was assault
ed and robbed at 3 a. m. last Friday. Gil
lece says that he was on his way home
when he was suddenly struck a heavy
blow across the face and rendered un
conscious. He claims that the robbers
secured a bag containing $306 in gold
and $6 in ailver from his pockets. Gil
lece stated yesterday that he could not
remember any of the particulars of the
assault and) robbery, and that he man
aged to find his way to his room, J6
Eleventh street. Gillece was badly
beaten on the face. The police doubt the
story of ttoe robbery, as Gillece admits
that his watch and^hain, gold pin and
some loose coin were not taken.

Ing goods and hats will be sold, beginning i
Thursday, at marvelous prices. Men's

BOXERS' TRAINING DAYS WILL SOON END'
JEFFRIES AND RUHLIN ARE EAGER
FOR THE MEETING ON FRIDAY NIGHT
CHAMPION JEFFRIES IN THE ACT OF TOSSING THE TWENTY-POUND MEDICINE BALL. THIS IS A FORM
OF EXERCISE THE BIG BuXER IS PARTIAL TO, AS HE BELIEVES IT STRENGTHENS THE MUSCLES OF
HIS BACK AND ARMS.
QEORGE SILER, the famous ref
eree and authority on things pu
gilletic, visited Ruhlln's training
quarters at the Six-Mile House
yesterday. Mr. Siler arrived
from Chicago Saturday nigrht and he de
cided to spend his first day on the coast
with Ruhlin and Billy Madden, with
whom he is friendly. As soon as Siler
had greeted Ruhlin and his manager, he
expressed surprise at Ruhlin'g condition.
"You look better than you ever did in
your life." said Siler. as he eyed Gus crit
ically. Ruhlin admitted feeling tne part,
arid said he was sorry his friend had not
dropped in on one of his working days,
when he could get a better idea of his
fitness to engage in a battle with the
champion of the world.
Mr. Siler was honestly impressed with
Ruhlins physical improvement. He has
seen the Akron giant in nearly all his big
fights, and he told Billy Madden that
Ruhlin looked bigger, healthier and live
lier than ever before. While Siler would
not express an opinion as to whether he
thought Ruhlin would win or lose, it could
l>e gleaned from the general tenor of his
conversation that he thought Ruhlin "had
a chance with the husky boiler-maker
Siler believes that Ruhlin Is big and

for Jeff, and while he would not pick
Ruhlin to win, he believes the possibility
of a surprise is good.
Mr. Siler has not visited Jeffries' quar
ters yet and knows practically nothing
of the champion's condition. "Ruhlin is
certainly in great shape for the contest,"
he said. "He looks bigger and stronger
by long odds than when he fought Shar

"BOOTS" DURNELL
IS DISQUALIFIED
Horseman Well Known
Here Is in Trouble
in France.
PARIS. Nov. 10.â C. T. ("Boots") Dur
nell, the American jockey and trainer,
has been disqualified for life by the
Jockey Club on the ground that he delib
erately remained at the post at St. Cloud
October 28, when he rode Londres in the
Prix de Marly Reroi.
Durnell protests that his remaining at
the post was due to a misunderstanding.
He says he has ridden for years in .th?
United States and has never been sum
moned before the stewards. Thomas H.
Williams Jr., president of the California
Jockey Club, stood sponsor for him when
he applied for the French license five
months ago. Durnell denies that he had
.any relations with the bookmakers.
"Boots" Durnell is known to all Califor
nia horsemen, having spent the greater
part of his life in and about this city. He
was a protege of Galen Brown and se

possible shape for the contest and should
make a hard fight to win. Madden tells
me that Gus has improved wonderfully
in his hitting. He always had a (fairly
good punch and if he has improved in his
hitting powers he will certainly make a
dangerpus opponent."
Ruhlin took his usual day off. Gust does
not believe in training on tne Satrbath.
He was up with the birds yesterday and
after eating a hearty breakfast he w ilked
over to South San Francisco, when- he
attended church. Upon returning Ruhlin
spent the remainder of the uay ori u.e

ting with many friends who journSeyed
down to the Six-Mile House despite the

Train Wheels Crush His Leg.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 10.â George H. Clark,
flagman at the narrow gauge freight
yards in this city, while attempting to
board a caboose attached to a trainlcÂ»ad
of sand this afternoon slipped and fell
beneath the car. Two wheels of the rfcar
truck passed over his left leg below the
knee and crushed it. The leg was ampu
tated above the knee. Clark had his right
leg crushed seven years ago and it was
amputated above the ankle. At that tibe
he was a brakeman on the same line
where he was hurt to-day.
ANGELS BAT OUT
A CLEAN VICTORY
Straighten Out Iburg's
Curves for Nineteen
Base Hits.
Dougherty Makes a Great
Record of Six Hits in
One Game.
Los Angeles won hands down from the
San Franciscos yesterday at Recreation
Park by a score of 11 to 1.
Joshua Reilly did all the scoring for the
Wa^ps. He was the first batter up in the
fifth inning and sent the first ball pitched
over the center-field fence for a home
run.
The Angels fell on Iburg's curves for a
total of nineteen hits. Dougherty made a
remarkable record as a batsman. He was
up six times and made six hits. This Is
the first time it has been accomplished
here this season. It is seldom a player
is at bat six times in a game. Having the
opportunity, it is seldom a man has the
ability to make a hit each time. Dough
erty scored four of the Angels' runs.
Pitcher McPartlin, who aggravates both
players and spectators by his delibera
tions, won his tenth successive victory.
The game was drawn out two hours
and ten minutes partly owing to Mc-
Partlin's methods. He carefully polishes
the ball and then goes all over it again.
Then he tries some of "March King" Sou
sa's movements. When he tires of this
he remembers there is sand in his glove
which must be removed. By this time
the batsman is ready to hit at anything
that comes over the plate. The jeers of
the spectators have no effect on McPart
lin. He goes through the same aggravat
ing tactics with the next man upâ and
wins games.
L.os Angeles played an errorless game,
while the Wasps are charged with three
errors, all of which let in runs.
The southern batters commenced their
execution in the second. Kihm and Hall,
the first two up, were out at first. Reilly
and Spies singled and McPartlin was
given a pass to ' flrst, filling the bases.
Hemphill bunted along the left foul line,
scoring Reilly. Dougherty scored Spies
with a well placed hit over the pitcher's
head. Atherton struck out, retiring the
side.
Kihm scored Dougherty in the fifth with
a two-bagger. Dougherty scored again in
the seventh, coming home on the throw
in of Hall's fly to left field. Dougherty
and Spies scored in the eighth on Ather
ton's two-bagger.
Los Angeles bunched its hits in the
ninth, scoring five men on five hits, aided
by some errors.
The field was slippery, providing un
safe footing for the players, especially
interfering with their throwing. The at
tendance was large. Score:

STRIKING SWITCHMEN"
RECEIVE NO SUPPORT
Brotherhood of Trainmen Decides to
Keep Its Organization Out
of the Fight.
DENVER. Nov. 10.â The strike of the
switchmen of the Rio Grande Railroad is
having but little effect on the traffic of
the road, according to the statements of
the railroad officials to-night. The switch
engines all over the system were fully
manned" to-day with the exception of
those at Alamosa and Sallda. The Broth
erhood of Railway Trainmen say they will
stand by the decision of Vice Grand Mas
ter Lee. in which he declared that the
agreement between his organization and
the Rio Grande was still in operation, and
that it covers switching. The switchmen
employed on the Colorado and Southern
Railroad, who it was reported would aid
the Rio Grande men in their strike, deny
this, saying that they will continue neu
tral.
FOR FREEDOM, THE $10,000 GREYHOUND.
DIES IN HIS KENNEL AT OCEAN VIEW
FOR FREEDOM, J. H. Rosseter's
JIO.OOO greyhound, is dead.
The great courser, whose sensa
tional victories on the field and
the recent successes of whose
progeny have made his name a household
word wherever coursing is known, suc
cumbed to disease superinduced by an at
tack of epizooty. which is prevalent here
among hortes. He died yesterday at
Pasha Kennels, near Ocean View.
For Freedom was bred by the great Eng
lish coursing firm of Fawcett Brothers,
and was whelped In January, 1896. He is
by Sir Sankey-Flitting Far. He trav
eled from England in a large wicker
crate and arrived 'here on March 16, 1898.
On March 19, three days later, he was
started in a stake! There was much cu
riosity among the coursing men to see
him in action, and his owner took this
method of gratifying their curiosity.
To the surprise of everybody he won
his first course and then the stake. The
betting opened at 10 to 1 against him.
From this it receded to 75 to 1. In the
semi-final round he showed such a turn
of speed that the odds were quickly ham
mered down to 2 to 5. In one round he
met the greyhound Move On and led him
so far Judge Bull, who was in the sad
dle, sent them back to the slips, thinking
Move On had not sighted the hare. The
second trial resulted the same, and then
it was seen how fast For Freedom was.
He won nine stakes, including one on
the Merced plains, and was then retired
to the stud. His puppies, which have ap
peared this year, promise to perpetuate
his name These Include Cold Shivers,
winner of the rich Futurity stakes;
Freeze Out, '-*li? Iceman, Royal Archer.

and Fontenoy.

brinclle with strong white markings. He
was of most aristocratic appearance. It
did not require the eye of an expert to
single him out from among a group of
PEPPER TARGETS
AT SHELL MOUND
Shooting Organizations
Hold Exciting
Contests.
Although the day was cloudy, the
marksmen at Sheii Ivlound yesterday
made some excellent scores. The shooting
in general was fully up to the average.
The Natonals composed of batteries B
and C National Guard Artillery, held the
eleventh contest of the year, and as most
of the poorer shots have dropped out the
fight for honors is close and exciting.
Sergeant J. W. Cobby distinguished him
self by making 24 points on each of the
three targets. F. P. Schuster won his
class contests in both the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein and Germania Rifle
Club shoots. McLaughlin and White did

LITTLE SISTER A WnfSTESL
Defeats Champion Palo Alto at Union
Coursing Park.
In as hard a run and as exciting a final
as has been seen at Union Coursing Park
in many months. George Sharman's clever
greyhound Little Sister beat Eugene
Geary's champion hound Palo Alto yes
terday for final honors in the sixteen-dog
special stake. The short end players were
jubilant over the result, for though Palo
Alto was a 1 to 2 favorite, the backers of
his half-sister were active in taking all
the tempting offers.
The dogs were slipped to a lively hare.
Palo Alto shewed slightly in advance up
the field and taking possession rolled up
the first five points. Little Sister got In
and before relinquishing the game made
a good score. By this time the coursera
had had a severe trial, but Palo Alto put
on extra steam and tried to end the
course. The hare proved strong enough
to avoid the great sprinter. Suddenly
Palo Alto swerved the game to Little
Sister and lost possession. ~ fter a few
points Sister got tne kill, winning the
stake by a score of 18 to 13.
In the open stake George Nethercott'a
Floodgate beat A. A. Vandenberg's
Naughty Girl for first honors by a score
of S to 2.
Great interest was manifested by the
coursing men in the plains meeting to bÂ«

LONDON. Nov. 10.â The fall In consols,
which is partially attributable to the
speech of thÂ© Chancellor of the Exchequer
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, foreshadowing
increased war taxes, caused everything to
be dull during the early part of last week,
out owing to the brisk revival in Ameri
can railway securities, ail the markets
closed better.
With the exception of Americans there
has been little Increase In business, but
the quickness with which prices rallied
has encouraged a belief that better mar
kets are in prospect. The Northern Pa
cific settlement is the subject of much dis
cussion, especially as to whether it is the
beginning of a new boom.
Continental exchange has improved
from the London point of view and there
i2 ere l 3 no immediate prospect of
gold shipments from London. The demand
ror gold in the open market has also di
minished. The pflce of bar gold shows a
slight decline. The shipment of gold to
South Africa, which began with the with
drawal of Â£118,000 week before last, seem*
likely to be larger than usual. It -is recJÃ
nÂ«ed . here that the French demand-I^^
gold has not been entirely satisfied by
>tew York shipments and that it will be
necessary to keep up rates in order to pre
vent the return of French capital.

have only been maintained. Some coal

CREATORS at last found a place
large enough to hold even him
last night In the Mechanics' Pa
vilion, where the farewell concert
cf the Royal Italian Band was
given in. aid of the Verdi memorial fund.
An Immense audience gathered to hear
the band, which for the first time here
really showed what it can do, and the
Verdi memorial fund Js handsomely bene
fited by the performance. All the Italian
POttmy of the town turned out to do honor

received their gifted young compatriots.

Coffee Being Replaced by Fostum
Food Coffee.
"I am the wife of a minister. About
three years ago a warm friend, an exem-
piary other and the conscientious wife
of a minister, asked .me if I had ever
tried giving up coffee and using the Poi-
tum Food Coffee. I had been telling her
of my excessive nervousness and ill
health. She said: 'We drink nothing
else for breakfast but Postum Pood Cof-
fejt and It is a delig-ht and comfort to
WÂ«rÂ« something that we do not have to
refuse the children when they ask for it.'
"I was surprised that she would permit
the children to drink any kind of coffee,
hut she explained that It was a most
healthful beverage and that the children
thrived on It. A very little thought con-
vinced me that for bralnwork one should
rot rely upon a stimulant such as coffee
is, but should have food and thÂ» very
lÂ»est of food.
"My first trial of Postum was a failure.
The maid of all work brought it to the
'able, lukewarm, weak, and altogether
lacking In character. We were in despair,
hut decided on one more trial. At the
second trial, we faithfully followed the
ejections, used four teaspoonsful to tha
Mr.t of water, let it boll full fifteen min-
utes after the real boiling: began, and
ferved It with rich cream. It was deli-
cious and we were ail won.
I have since sung the praises of Postum
Pood Coffee on many, many occasions
'Â«nd have induced numbers of friends to
abandon coffee and use Postum, with re-
markable results. The wife of a college

up his band and walkâ to the middle of
the hi.il, which he did, the audience good
naturedly reseating itself accordingly.
And then Creatore showed what he could
do and from the Verdi "Aroldo" over
ture to the 'Carmen' fantasie that ended
the programme, the evening was one long
triumph for the brilliant young Italian.
The best number was the "Tannhauser"
overture, that was given with a distinc
tion, brilliance, grace and finish of inter
i relation and execution that could not be
lettered by any living conductor with the
same material to work with. Creatore
just picked up anything he wanted with
the point of that magic baton of his and
he lias a corps of men of whom'any con
ductor would bo proud.
In the spacious hall every good quality
of the band had a fair chance to make It
self apparent, and to the fine precision,
shading and attack that have before been
conceded to the organization, must now
be added an adequate appreciation of its
COLOMBIAN WAR
FEELING GROWS
Liberals Along Frontier
Angered Against the
Castro Family.
WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao.
Nov. 10.â Advices received here from Ca
pacho Vlejo, dated November 5, say that
thÂ« report from President Castro to his
brother. Oelestino Castro, at San Cristo
bal, to the effect that the United States
Government "insists upon mediating be
tween Venezuela and Colombia." caused
the greatest' excitement among the troops
on the frontier. General Uribe-Uribe and
General Modesto Castro immediately set
out for San Cristobal to obtain details.
It seems that General L'rlbe-Uribe re
fused to believe the report, declaring that
he had no fears as to the future of the
Liberal cause, because Prepldent Castro
had given him a cast-iron pledge not to
forsake him.
"Should President Castro prove untrue
to the Liberal cause," exclaimed General
Uribe-I'rlbe, "the result would be his
ruin. The war will end in Colombia be
fore Christmas."
There is considerable feeling against the
Castro family among the Colombian Lib
erals and along the frontier in conse
quence of a widespread rumor that Celes
tino Castro, who is commander In chief
at San Cristobal, has been privately sell-
Ing cattle to the enemy, the cattle being
secured by means of alleged raids of Co
lombian Conservatives. During one of
these raids a dozen soldiers were killed
on both sides. It is said that the cattle
changÂ« hands at a prearranged price of
$20 per head. The blood thus spilled is
charged directly to Celestlno Castro by
the indignant people of Tachlra.
CURACAO, Nov. 10.â Dr. Eduardo
Blanco, Venezuelan Minister of Foreign
Affairs, has resigned his portfolio. He
will be succeeded by Dr. Pachano.
The cause of the resignation was a disa
greement regarding the Colombian ques
tion, particularly the answer of President
Castro to the Pan-American Congress in
the City of Mexico, which was sent with
out Dr. Blanco's knowledge.

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 10. -The Rus
sian leader writers have put President
Roosevelt and the United States on the
list of their regular themes. Scarcely a
day passes without sorno newspaper de
voting a serious editorial to the develop
ment of the political and economic power
of the United States. This In itself is
gratifying, but what Is more so is that
nearly all the papers are sympathetic and
many display accurate insight into Amer
ican affairs. The Bourse Gazette prints
tho following:
The statesman who has unexpectedly as
sumed the reins at Washington U the perfect
type of the American of to-Uay and before
him lies a v. ider horizon than any of his pre
decessors enjoyed. Between the United States
of our day and the republic of which the his
tory of the last century told us thÂ«re Is little
In common. The classic land at freedom the
country which has developed its prosperity to
wonderful dimensions and which has realized
the boldest Utopias and the most darlni theories
of political and social liberty, the great trans
atUntlc republic, terrifies tho Imagination of
Europeans. It Is a new giant, a state which
the latest events have made a world power
a state which has transformed Itself to the
point of recognlzablllty and Is bent upon trans
formiiiK the whole world, proclaiming throuich
Its new chief magistrate that tho word of tho
United States shall have due weight every
where where economic and political questions
are decided.

BIG GAME MAY
PAY EXPENSES
Prospects for California
Are Bright for An
other Year.
Football Men Will Consider
Princeton's Offer for
Match.
BERKELEY. Nov. 10.â Berkeley is hop
ing that this season the intercollegiate
football game will pay the expenses of
the team. Last year Manager Reno
Hutchinson paid ali of the expenses of
the team for the year and liquidated the
entire athletic debt that hung over the
university, amounting to several thousand
dollars. This year Manager Decoto says
the indications are that expenses will be
paid. Financial returns cannot be had as
early as this, but Decoto estimates tha;
there were 12,000 people, at the football
game yesterday and that California's
chare of the receipts will meet the outlay
that he has made during the year. He
does not look tor much profit, and says
that he will be satisfied it' he comes out
â¢yen.
Princeton's offer to play a game with
California In this State this winter will
be considered by the executive committee
of the student body to-morrow. The an
swer la In question, but siiuuul the foot
ball men be willing a game will be ar
ranged. Some of the eleven are unde
cided about their ability to take up train
ing again, and unless they are eager to
meet Princeton the offer oi the New Jer
sey university will be declined.
California's prospects tor next year's
football contest are bright. Many veter
ans of the gridiron will be left, and the
unusually large and good supply of fresh
man material will be on hand to develop.
Besides this the Berkeley contingent be
lieves that a style of coaching has beeij
secured and a spirit aroused which will be
hard to overcome. In fact, a series of
victories is looked for on the football field
such as California has secured on the
track. Dr. Frank Simpson, the head
coach is receiving his full share of praisj
for the splendid manner in which he
brought out the team.
Of this year's varsity but two will grad
uateâCaptain Womble, end and back, and
Ilhnsen, tackle. Womble can never play
again against Stanford, as yesterday's
game was his fourth in the intercollegiate
contests, and intercollegiate rules forbid a
man entering more than four. As this
was Hansen's first year on the big eleven
he can take post graduate work and com
pete again if he chooses. All the other
men expect to continue their college
courses. There will be left Gendotti at
center; Giant Overall, Stow and Stroud.
guards; Albertson, tackle; Hudson and
Starr, ends; More, quarter; Mini, Duden.
Whipple and Sherman, backs; Dibblee,
who would have gone into the game but
for a wrenched knee, will be back for end.
Clay, guard, and Gammon, back, who
played on last year's varsity and later left
college, may return to university work.
Both signify their intention of so doing.
The addition of these two men to the
squad will materially strengthen It.
There are a large number of freshmen
out who should make strong 1 bids for the
varsity next year and make up a splendid
second eleven. Morehead and Howard are
heavy men for center. Howard is> also a
good guard. Possibly he. Heitmuller and
Stroud, who went into the game yester
day after Overall was put off the field,
should make a strong run for one of the
places. Watson, Metealf. Gastrich and De
merritt will he out for line position. Back
of the line there will be Risley, Graves,
K'ttrrpll. SaeltztT and Evans.
Dr. Simpson stated to-day that pros
pects for the coming- season were very en
couraging. "There Is plenty of splendid
material left," he said, "and this victory
should bring nut all the boys. Every man
on the team has promised to be back next
year, if not to try for the eleven at least
to help coach. There Is plenty of loyalty
there and among the students and
alumni."
OHIO ELECTION RETURNS
SHOW A GREAT SHORTAGE
CINCINNATI. Nov. 10,-With almost
j half of the official returns from the
eighty-eight counties in Ohio received, It
is estimated that the total vote' may be
100,000 less than for Governor two years
ago, when 920, 572 votes were cast, and al
most a quarter of a million less than for
President last year, when the total vote
of Ohio was 1,349,121.
Notwithstanding the increase in popu
lation during the past thirteen years, the
total vote will likely be much less than
for President In ISSB, when it was 841,011.
and probably less than has been cast for
Governor since that time with a single
exception.
The returns show that the greatest
shortage was among the Democrats out
side of the cities, and It is variously at
tributed to the silver question, prevailing
prosperity, the death of McKinley. In
dorsement of President Roosevelt, Gov
ernor Nash, Senator Foraker, and other
causes.

SUSPECT FRAUD
Say Corpse Shown Them
Is Not That of Man

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 10.â The
corpse sent here from Jeffersonville, Ind.,
as that of Newell C. Rathbun of this
city, United States recruiting officer, who
was reported to have died in a Jefferson
ville hotel a few days ago^is not the body
of Rathbun, according to the assertion
made here to-day by Samuel M. Powell,
State manager of the Metropolitan Llfo
Insurance Company.
In his statement Manager Powell is sup
ported by Dr. C. Jennings, the company's
examining physician; B. P. Sisk, who
placed half of the lite insurance on Rath
bun; by Mrs. J. C. Watkins, with whom
Rathbun boarded up to the time of his
marriage a short time ago, and by oth
ers.
Powell requested the undertaker to
postpone the funeral, set for to-day, un
til he can place the Information of his
alleged discovery in the possession of a
detective.
Powell made a statement to-day. In
which he said: 'â¢This case is so very un
usual from my lirst connection with it that
1 shall be surprised at nothing that may
develop In regard to it."
Powell said that Ralhluin had voluntar
ily asked for $-vuo insurance, saying that
he was tho United States army recruiting:
officer of this city and soon to be married.
"A few days later he called again at my
office," faid Powell, "but I was absent,
and niyV>ftiee man, B. I. Sisk, wrote him
$2000 additional. When I read the notice
of his sudden death I was astonished.
He was too healthy, according to my
mind, to drop off in that way. and 1
thought it might be a case of suicide, and
determined to have an autopsy. This
morning, in company with Dr. Jen
nings, 1 went to the house where the re
mains were to make the request of his
wife and to have the autopsy over be
fore the hour of the funeral."
Powell snid tltat several persons who
knew Rathbun well were present, and
when the remains were exposed to view
it was the general opinion that the body

ORANGE CROP SMALLER
THAN THAT OF LAST YEAR
Estimates in Southern California
Show Decrease, but Fine Quality
Is Promised.
I,OS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â Careful and
conservative estimates of the orange crop
of Southern California for the season 1901
02 indicate that It will be from 13 to 20
per cent less than that of last year, but
with normal climatic conditions, the fruit
will be of excellent quality.
There is the usual variance in these es
timates howevef, an optimistic view from
Riverside County being that the drop will
exceed that of last season. In the Red
land* .district it is thought the decrease
will be from 10 to 30 per cent. The ter
ritories of Pomona. Ontario, Azusa and
Covlna indicate a deficit of nearly one
third, while some of the growers in the
vicinity of Ontario are of the opinion that
their yield will not be more thai) half of
what it was last season. In Orange
County it is said there will be a decrease
of about 25 per cent as compared with the
previous crop, while San Diego County's
shipments will equaltlioae of last year.

Fitly Commemorated.
The fortieth anniversary of the Gentle

forty years of the sodality's existence,
and during that time had missed but one
Sunday meeting.
The entire sodality received holy com
munion in a body at the 7:30 o'clock mass.
Rev. J. Hickey is director, James K.
Kelly prefect and John E. Fitzpatrlck
first assistant prefect of the sodality.

A SEASON OF HIGH CLASS GRAND OPERA
ORPHEUM GIVES
EXCELLENT SHOW
"Shore Acres" Splendidly-
Presented at the
California.
"The Girl With the Auburn Hair"
thrilled the Orpheum patrons last night
with her rich mezzo-soprano voice and
dazzling transformation scenic effects.
The act is truly styled the sensation of
the decade. John Morrissey stood at the
back of the house and smiled confidently
and winked knowingly when quizzed
about the much talked of novelty. When
"The Girl With the Auburn Hair" began
her solo behind a beautiful church scene,
resembling very much the one in "The
Old Homestead," the big audience was
hushed into silence and the dazzling sheen
of the calcium faded gradually and gave
way to the prettiest transformation effect
that has ever held down the boards at
the popular playhouse. "The Girl With
the Auburn Hair" is certainly a pearl of
great price as far as beauty and ability to
sing are concerned.
Lillian Burkhart appeared in a brand
new act, entitled "The Eighth Year," and
increased her local popularity several
pegs.
Fred Niblo's streak of funny sayings
and up-to-date side-bursters kept the
house in paroxysms of laughter. The
Onllaw trio of aerial equilibrists do a first
rate act. Mile. Onllaw balances a bicycle
on a slack wire, supported by the teeth of
her two male partners, who balance them
selves on a pedestal while performing
their feat of strength. The Frazer troupe
of international dancers and Burton's
troupe of acrobatic dogs are also features
of the bill. The Lockos do a clever bag
punching act. Joseph Adelman, with his
new invention, the chime organ, was well
rec eived.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The performance of "Shore Acres" at
the California last night did not begin un
til 9 o'clock, owing to a belated train, but
a big audience was amply repaid for Its
patience by witnessing a splendid produc
tion of the popular play. James A. Herne
has been replaced in the part of Nathaniel
Berry by James T. Galloway, who close
ly resembles his precedessor, not only in
looks but also In his work. The same
company that supported Herne is with the
present production and all the members
give valuable assistance in the portrayal
of the homelike scenes and Incidents with
which the piece abounds. The famous

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1901.
Famous Carmen Refuses to Be Separated From Collie Queen
Victoria Gave Her, and Though Sick and Unhappy, She Seeks
Other Lodgings, Where the Adored Animal Is Made Welcome
ME. EMMA CALVE, the world
famous Carmen and one of the
big Grau stars, arrived in town
yesterday morning and went to
the Palace Hotel. At 3 o'clock
In the afternoon the great singer, sick
and unhappy, left the Palace and betook
herself, her maid servant, her man serv
ant and her dog to the Crocker, a board
ing-house at the corner of Leavenworth
and Pine streets. Mme. Calve left the big
hostelry because a stony hearted man
the accessories of a home dinner created
much amusement. The savory odor of
the national bird permeated the audi
torium and drove several dyspeptics to
eat the first meal they had enjoyed in
years. Marion Cullen, as Helen Berry,
who braves her father's displeasure to run
off with the man she loves, was sweet and
natural. Allen Crolius as Young Nat
Berry was typical of the irrepressible boy.
Charles E. Fisher as Joel Gates and
v ivien Bryen as "Mandy " Gates fur
nished much of the fun, most of which
caused shrieks of laughter.
Next week Haverly's Minstrels, enlarged
and improved, come to this house.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At 7:45 to-nightâ take particular note of
the time, for impresrio Grau is a man of
his wordâ the rirst Hote of the gran.l
opera season will be struck, in "Lohen
grin," at the Grand Opera-house.
All the artists who take part in the op
era are known to us here with the excep
tion of Emma Eames, whose appearance
is one of the events of the season. Th-?
magnificent Ortrud of Mme. Schumann-
Heink is remembered with intense pleas
ure, as also Mr. Van Dyck's superb ren
dering of the title role. Edouard d 3
Reszke's king, Mr. Blspham as Telra
mund and Mr. Muhlmann as the herald
are other splendors of the cast, not to
mention the conducting, which is in the
competent hands of Walter Damrosch.
Mme. Eames is sajd to be one of tha
finest Elsas on the stage, and the interest
in her appearance is second to none of
the new stars that Mr. Grau brings with
him this year. Chorus, orchestra and
mountings are of the usual splendid order
of anything connected with Mr. Grau s
name. At 7:45, remember.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"The First Duchesa of Marlborough "
with Sarah Cowell Le Moyne in the title
role, at the Columbia Theater is one of
the most striking artistic successes of the
season. No actress that has come here
for many months compare with Mrs. Le
Moyne as a reader, and she is no less
satisfying as an actress. She is excel
lently suited in Mr. Metzger's play,
though it by no means exhibits her in the
full range of her genius. Mrs. Le Moyne
will be warmly welcomed here should
she come West again, her commanding
intelligence sufficing to make any play
in which she might appear strongly in
teresting. In Mrs. Le Moyne's support
are to be found many sterling actors in
particular Frederick Paulding, Joseph
Wllkes, Mary E. Barker and Nora
O'Brien. â¢

the new leading ladies, have both become
great favorites with the house, and Mr
Alsop is strengthening with each per
formance the favorable impression hs
made on his first appearance. Next week
the recent Madison-square success, "Se;f
and Lady," will be put on.

The clever ycung folks of the Pollard
Australian Juvenile Opera Company are
attracting large houses at the Tivoll. It
is one of the most successful novelties of
the season. The children slnjr. dance an.l.
act in a fashion that shames more thai
one company of the elders that have done
light opera here, and the pieces are cos
tumed and mounted with satisfactory
splendor. The stage management is thor
oughly up to date and the music, under
the direction r>f Alfred E. Moulton, goes
with snap and finish throughout. The
week's bill will be "A Gaiety Girl."

The Central promises to outdo itself
this week in an elaborate production of
the "Lights o' London," in which the
scenic artist will play a strong part. Tho
London bridge scene is said to be one of
the most realistic pictures that the Cen
tral stage has ever seen. Hallett Thomp
son, the new leading man. will appear as
Harold Armytage, and others in the cast
are Willard Blackmore, Ernest Howel!,
Annette Marshall and Oza Waldrop.

The new bill which opens at the Chute?
agÂ«ment positively refused to permit the
great diva to keep her dog "Jack" In the
room with her. They offered the magnifi
cent Scotch collie the hospitality of the
hotel cellar, but the devoted animal set
up such a piteous yelp on being separated
Â»from his mistress that the great singer's
heart was torn.
"What!" she cried in her native tongue,
"allow my beloved dog that Queen Vic
toria gave me to be Imprisoned In a damp
cellar? Never! If he can't stay in my
room with me, why I'll go where he can,"
and the management proving relentless
MANY STRIKERS
TO RESUME WORK
Machinists Will Take
Advantage of Win
ter Schedule.
While the machinists' strike is still in
full official existence it is probable that
to-day will see most of the shops with
full complements of hands. The regular
winter hour schedule, which conforms
with the schedule demanded by the strik
ers, goes into effect to-day, and It is ex
pected that a majority of the striking ma
chinists will take advantage of this to re
turn to work.
There have been so many rumors of tho
men returning to work that none of the
employers are banking too much on to
day's promised cessation of hostilities.
"We will believe they are coming back
when we see them," is all they say about
the matter.
At the headquarters of the Machinists'
Union those in authority declined to dis
cuss the matter at all. "Our fight for
nine hours' work and no reduction of
pay is still on and we're going to fight un
til we win out," is still the burden of their
song.
As the winter schedule conforms with
this demand the men will be able to re
turn to work now with some show of con
sistency. As far as the employers are
concerned they are more than willing to
resume active operations and are not go
ing to borrow trouble by worrying about
the men's action when the time comes for
the resumption of the summer schedule,
which involves an extra hour's work for
the same pay.
In spite of the machinist leaders' refusal
to talk, however, and of the employers'
expressions of incredulity, it seems to be
pretty certain that this week will see most
of the men back at work. They will ac
cept the truce offered by the winter
schedule and in the meanwhile spare no
efforts to make the peace permanent.
There is plenty of work awaiting the men
who have been idle since May 20 and al
though they may not expect ever to make
up the wages lost during the strike, there
is plenty of opportunity for some good
pay days between now and Christmas.
While the union officials refuse to dis
cuss the matter, individual members de
clare that their return to work to-day is
not only a possibility but a certainty and
that their return is under instructions
from union headquarters.
Assaults Husband With Knife.
Mrs. Mary Lynch, who lives at 24 Gil
bert street, last evening cut her husband,
Thomas Lynch, across the face with a
carving knife. Thomas was treated at
the Receiving Hospital. Mary was ar
rested and locked up with a charge of
assault to murder placed against her.
n hen Lynch was taken to the hospital he
told a story of an encounter with un
known men, but police Investigation re
vealed Mary the guilty party. Mary, it
seems, returned to her home about 7
o clock in the evening somewhat the worse
for liquor. Her husband's protestations
aroused her anger and resulted in the
light, which ended with the knife assault
Lynch's wound is not dangerous.

Mme. Calve left the big hotel and went
to the family boarding-house where weil
behaved dogs are tolerated. Up at the
Crocker there was a great commotion
when the celebrated singer arrived. A
courteous physician placed his room at
the disposal of the diva, the landlady
gave ud to her the private parlor, and
the two rooms converted into a suite made
very spacious and elegant apartments for
the great star.
Mme. Calve is a very sick woman. She
is suffering from a severe attack of bron
chial trouble, and while her illness is not
alarming her physician advises the great
est care, strict seclusion and absolute
rest. Therefore, as soon as her rooms at
the Crocker were in readiness the great
Binger retired and denied herself to all
callers, making, graciously, however an
exception for The Call representative on
account of a mutual and much esteemed
friend.
Although her illness had almost robbed
ncr of her voice, in no other way is it
apparent that the great Carmen is ill.
Diva Is a Beautiful Woman.
Mme. Calve is more than beautiful. Her
eyes are big and of a deep brown and
full of light and fire of soul. Her nose
is fine and sensitive. Her mouth is fas
cinating. It is neither small nor yet too
large, and when the coral lips part with
a dimpling smile there is a charm about
the singer that one would find it hard to
resist. She has a beautifully shaped head,
crowned with masses of raven black hair,
and a skin that is fine and smooth and
with that ivory tint to it that the French
call matte. She is tall and large, not fat-
She has a wonderful chest development,
a magnificent throat and arms that are
magnificently molded.
Her voice Is caressing and smooth as
velvet. When she speaks her face lights
up, her eyes flash and again melt and a
wonderful magnetism that is her very es
sence holds captive all around her.
Mme. Calve speaks but very little Eng
lish. She has a vocabulary of about ten
English words. She can say "How do you
do," "thank you" and "I am sick," and
she says them all with a delicious French
accent that is most fascinating.
In her native tongue she told her joys
and her woes to 'me Call interviewer.
She confessed that she had seen consid
erable of California from the car window,
but that she was madly in love with the
State, its flowers, its green fields and
dancing sunlight.
"I am so sorry." she whispered, "that
I shall not be able to sing on Tuesday
evening. I have heard much about San
Francisco audiences and I am anxious to
see if they will be pleased with me. I
am taking extreme care of myself and
hope to be able to sing on Friday even
ing. I do not want to disappoint the San
Francisco public if I can help it.
"I shall religiously do everything my
doctor orders me to," went on the singer,
sipping a glass of milk, the first thing on
the programme of the physician's instruc
tion, "and I hope to be well soon. I had
a bad cold in Los Angeles, and as I did
not wish to disappoint the people I sang
in spite of it. The result is this bronchial
trouble that has robbed me temporarily
of my voice.
Singer I*oves Her Dog.
"What do you think of that Palace Ho
tel," went on the diva, brushing aside the
subject of her illness, "not to allow my
dog in my room? They said 'put him in
the cellar.' I had him put there. When
I was about to leave him he barked so
piteously that my heart was torn and I
determined then and there to leave the
hotel. It was so lonely in that cellar. It
was just like a prison. What I would not
wish to befall me I will not allow to
happen to my dog. I love my dog and he
adores me. We have never been parted.
Queen Victoria gave him to me two
months before she died and he has been
with me ever since. He is devoted and
gentle and I cannot understand how any
one could object to him."
As a preliminary to taking the splendid
care that is going to banish the provok
ing cold and consequent hoarseness. Calve
had the gas extinguished and called for a
large oil lamp to be used for illuminating
her apartments.
"Gas consumes the oxygen and that is
bad for the voice," she explained. For
the same reason the diva asked that coal
should be banished from her grate and
only logs used. "I must get well," she
declared, "so I can sing to your audi
ences that I am so anxious to please and
see your beautiful city, of which I have
heard so much."
GRATJ'S STAHS ABBIVE.
Members of Opera Company Come on
Special Train.
The members of the Grau Opera Com
pany arrived from Los Angeles on a spe
cial train at midnight last night. It was
expected that the party would reach here
at 9 o'clock, but fate decreed otherwise.
The train did not arrive at Castroville
until 7 o'clock, and a stop was made for
dinner. A start was made for this city
at 8;30. and the singers arrived in a
tired condition from their long trip. They
were assigned to their apartments in the
Palace and retired for a much-needed
rest.
When asked for interviews they all
pleaded fatigue, but expressed themselves
as delighted to be once more in San
Francisco. They were exceedingly happy
over their successes in the southland,
which were veritable triumphs, they said.
In the party were:
Mme. Gadskl. Mme. Segard, Suzanne Adams.
