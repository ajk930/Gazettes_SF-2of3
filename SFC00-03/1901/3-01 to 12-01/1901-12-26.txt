AND THE MILITARY ARE CALLED OUT BEFORE THE DISTURBANCE IS QUELLED
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT RENEWS ITS EFFORTS
TO HAVE AMERICAN LAWS SO EXTENDED AS
TO GUARD ITS SUBJECTS AGAINST LYNCHING
Embassador From the Court of King Victor Emmanuel De
clares a Cash Indemnity ;Would Not Be Considered
Adequate Restitution for Recent Outrage in Erwin, Miss.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 25.â Tho
Italian Government has been
renewing its efforts of late
â¢with the authorities in Wash
ington to have our Federal
statutes so extended as to protect for
eigners in cases arising within the Juris
diction of States, thus giving a Federal
remedy for lynchings and like outrages
directed against Italians, such as have
occurred in Louisiana, Colorado and Mls
fissippl. It is the exchange of views re
cently which brought on the discussion
In the Italian Senate, when Baron Fava
interpellated the Italian Premier as to
â  the progress of an adjustment. Immedi
ately on the arrival of the new Embassa
oor, Bignor Mayar des Pianches, he took
up this question, which had arisen in
connection with the lynchings of several
Italian citizens In Irwin, Miss. In this
connection Signor Mayar said to-day:
Treaty Proves One-Sided.
"Under the treaty which exists between
Italy and the United States the citizens
of each country are guaranteed the full
est protection while residing in the other
country. In the case of Americans re
tidlng in Italy they have exactly the same
rights, thÂ© same protection, the same re
course to the courts that fin Italian sub
ject enjoys. The only exception is in con-
Eectilon with political rights. In the case
of Italians residing in the United States
the treaty assures them the same rights
and protection given to American citi
zens. But. unfortunately, this expression
of thÂ© treaty, so far as it relates to Ital
ians in this country. Is somewhat theo
retical, for under the American system.,
which limits the Federal authority over
States, the central government is not
able to give effect to the guarantee laid
down by the treaty. We fully recognise
the difficulties of this situation, which
been as apparent to the statesmen
this country as they have to those of
Italy. "We have hoped this would bring
about the enactment of a law which
would permit the Federal Government to
carry out the guarantees of the treaties.
This would be a genuine remedy for af
fairs similar to those which hayÂ© oc
curred in Louisiana and Mississippi, and
would prevent the periodical agitation

over cases arising In the States. As these
cases arose they would be assured of at
tention under the Federal authority, with
careful regard for the execution of treaty
obligations.
Does Not Seek Blood Money.
"Since the recent lynchings at Erwln,
Miss., there has been more or less dis
cussion of the payment of a money in
demnity. But, in the view of the' Italian
Government, the question of indemnity
does not enter Into the case. There has
been no suggestion coming from us, much
less a demand, for a cash Indemnity to
the Government. The Italian Government
does not seek blood money. At the same

LONDON. Dec. 26.â The Daily News

state providing the payment; of : the three

urally willing to listen to a suggestion of
a monetary indemnity, and when these
suggestions are voluntarily made by tho
State or Federal authorities we can do
nothing more than be the medium for
considering them In behalf of our people.
Such Indemnities are to the people af
fected, and not to the Italian Govern
ment, which feels that there Is a far
greater question involved than any finan
cial return to individuals. It is the real
and the permanent remedy "of having the
Federal laws give to Italian subjects the
protection guaranteed in our treaties that
we desire, and it is to this end that any
exchanges of views are tending, rather
.than to the payment of indemnities in
special cases. What the Italian Govern
ment desires is a system cbverlng all
cases."

FORT-OF-SFAIN, Dec. 25.â Another
complication has arisen between France
and Venezuela owing to President Cas
; tro's proclivity In getting into hot water
whenever an occasion is offered. With a
revolution on his hands, with Germany
preparing to enforce her claims by a na
val demonstration in "Venezuelan waters
and with Colombia anxious for his over
throw, Castro has added another to the
grievances of France against the Vene
zuelan Government, because French citi
zens' rights have been violated.
This new grievance arises from the
seizure of the properties of Senor Manuel
H. Matos, leader of the new Venezuelan
revolution and a man of wealth. Senor
Matos leased a part of his properties to
M. Secrestat of Bordeaux for two years,
under the Venezuelan Civil Code, which
permits such a transaction to be effected
without â  the necessity, of .- registering the
documents.".- By the seizure, of the leased
properties President; Gaitro- has- deprived
M. Secrestat of their revenue and use. , rx>
France ' Takes Prompt Action.
The French Government has notified
President Castro of the Infringement of
M. Secrestat' s rights and that It intends
to protect them to the fullest extent by
demanding damages and interest If the
revenues are not Immediately paid over
to M. Secrestat. France has made a com
plete investigation and has learned that
the demand, even under Venezuelan law,
is well founded.
Venezuela has been on bad terms with
France since the rupture of diplomatic
relations in 1S95, because the South Amer
ican republic would not pay French claims
growing out of revolutions.
Germany intends to act immediately
against President Castro's Government
for the latter's failure to pay interest on
the debt owing German bankers during
the last three years, and also Its failure
to settle other claims of subjects of the
German Emperor. The German claims
arising out of the late revolution amount
to about 2,000,000 bolivars, and It is said
that $2,000,000 is due for coupons not paid
on the German loan.
The naval demonstration, it is said,
would have taken place by this time had
it not been that the German cruiser VI
neta needed repairs and had to go to the
United States for an overhauling. It is
believed that within a short time Presi
dent Castro will find a German squadron
making an effective demonstration In
Venezuelan waters and that a Venezuelan
port has been seized.
Germany's Naval Demonstration.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 25.â United States
and German warships are converging on
Venezuela. Three of the German vessels
are at St. Thomas and a fourth is at
Port-of-Spaln, Trinidad. They are ex
pected to shortly assemble and, In squad
ron formation, move on and occupy a
Venezuelan port.
In order that the United States' inter
ests, may be adequately protected, the
United States has gathered in the Carib
bean Sea a force more formidable even
than that which destroyed Spanish naval
power in the Western Atlantic. The bat
tleships Kearsarge, Alabama and Massa
chusetts are at Havana and will sail to
morrow to continue their cruise, which
will carry them very near to the Vene
zuelan coast. The battleship Illinois, now
at Algiers, La., will join them within a
few weeks. The battleship Indiana will
remain at Curacao. 170 miles from La
Guayra, and If the revolution in Vene
zuela menaces United States interests she
will hurry, to Venezuelan waters; if not,
she will join the squadron.
Besides the battleships, the United
States flag files from the masts of two
gunboats and three training ships now in
the Caribbean Sea. They will be rein
forced by seven more training ships be- j
fore the winter is at an end. The Gulf i
of Parla, a magnificent sheet of water
which washes the shore of Venezuela,
will be the destination of most of these
ships.
The authorities have not- lost sight of
the advantage of having warships in
close proximity to Venezuela. Complica
tions dangerous' to the United States may
follow a German demonstration in Vene
zuelan waters, and the administration de
sires to be prepared to meet them.
The Navy; Department received a tele
gram to-day announcing that the train
ing-ship Prairie would leave Tompklns
ville at daylight for Hampton Roads,
whence she will proceed direct to Port
of-Spaln, or Trinidad Island, just off the
north coast of Venezuela,
FIGHT STARTS IN DAVE TARPEY'S SALOON,
BUT SOON BECOMES GENERAL FOR SEVERAL
HUNDRED PROTECTORS OF THE NATION
William Ross Is Stabbed in
Back but Not Seriously
Hurt.
NOT much of peace on earth nor
.good will toward men was dis
played yesterday afternoon by
more than 1000 howling soldiers In
front of Dave Tarpey's saloon, on
Baker street, near Greenwich, just
outside the Presidio grounds. They
were men from several regiments,
cursing, yelling, demanding blood
and mixing in a general free-for-all
SCENES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF DAVE TARPEY'S SALOON ON BAKER STREET. WHERE A RIOT
STARTED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, IN WHICH 1000 SOLDIERS PARTICIPATED AND WHICH WAS
FINALLY QUELLED BY THE \ POLICE AND ARMED GUARDS.

fight. The riot was finally quelled by
the police and several detachments of
troops from the Presidio. Revolvers,
clubs, stones and mud were brought Into
play during the riot, and for their partici
pation fifty-nine of Uncle Sam's warriors
are under arrest in the reservation and
fifteen of them are lodged In the North
End police station. '
The wonder of the riot Is _ that no one
was seriously injured. Dave Tarpey's sa
loon received a shake-up that brought
back recollections of the old Tennessee
days. Not satisfied, with .tearing 'down
bottles, demolishing furniture and trying
to make debris out of Tarpey's place, the
infuriated . mob of soldiers moved down
Bakervetreet to Greenwich and up Green
wich to Lyon, where P. W. Anderson has
a saloon. Windows were smashed here
and a few shots were fired into the place
Just by way of variety. At this juncture
the police arrived and under Sergeant El
lis did effective work In dispersing the
rioters.
Fight Centers Around Ross.
On one of the cots in the post ; hospital
at the Presidio lies Private William Rossi
suffering from a cut In the back.' Around
Ross the disturbance of the day centers.
About' 3 : o'clock, in the afternoon he was
â¢walking up Baker street with a pail on
his arm when he noticed two soldiers
fighting on the sidewalk. Ross, who is a
, private In the Seventieth Coast Artillery,
â¢;...*â¢;â :
interfered. The street brawlers belonged
to the Eleventh Cavalry and one of them
vowed vengeance on Ross for taking a
hand. Ross helps to serve drinks in Tar
pey's saloon whenever he can get away
from post duty. Early In the morning he
ejected two bellicose corporals of the
Eleventh Cavalry for rowdyism and
threats of destruction.
Liquor flowed freely just outside the
precincts of. the Presidio all day long and
when the early hours of the evening
were reached there was fire and riot in
the air. The corporal of the Eleventh
that vowed vengeance on Ross collected
a few of his comrades together and then
they went looking for. their enemy. Ross
was in Tarpey's saloon waiting on custom
ers" at the time. Dave Tarpey himself
was sitting behind the counter, reading a
paper when the soldiers entered his place.
Ross moved out in front of the bar to
draw a glass of beer when a corporal of
the Eleventh Cavalry rushed toward him,
caught him. about the neck and stabbed
him In the back. Ross fought until he
could fight no longer. Chairs were bran
dished, bottles thrown about and clubs
used with reckless disregard for heads or
furniture. Tarpey saved Ross from fur
ther injur'y. by dragging him out through
the . rear door of the saloon and having
him carried over to the post hospital.
Riot Quickly Follows.

of Tarpey'a, but they soon returned
threatening vengeance and punishment
on the head of the proprietor If he
brought charges against them or divulged
the names of any who took part in the
fracas. News of the row traveled fast
and in a very short time choice pugilistic
representatives from various regiments
were on hand. ready for further violence.
Ross was forgottten in the frenzy and
the soldier mob was ready for anything.
One man had a rope in his hand, another
was on the lookout for kerosene. Stone3
were thrown at windows and at men.
The "casuals," recruits who will soon be
on their way to Manila, came down from
the old site of the Tennessee regiment
and Joined in the melee.
Police Officers Hostetter. Rice and Her
ring, whose details He immediately out
side the Presidio grounds, rang for help
and Sergeant Tom Ellis of the North End
station I responded with the wagon and
Officers Frary, Brown, Riley, Alvares,
Rooker, Meagher and Tlerney. The fight
between the police and the soldiers was
a hot one. Stones wrought the greatest
damage and every officer engaged has a
mark or two to show for the .conflict.
George O. Brown came out of the strug
gle with a deep gash over his eye and
was taken tq_ the hospital. Sergeant El

The Wisconsin. /^as supposed to sail for

cause of her premature departure was tho
fact that tne imen were quarantined
aboard nhe ship on account of an epidemic
of rneasies. Toi^ prevented the men from

A large number of. vessels bound for

this fleet were the schooners Churchill and
Novelty and the ship Prince Louis from
Newcastle, all of which are long- over
due, trom the same port. the schooners
Robert Searles and Su3ie M. Plummer and
the bark James Johnson are due.

A strong southerly wind has prevailed
for the past few days. This, it was ex

winds Inter-island traffic is almost | aban
doned. '. Several schooners engaged in the
trade have not been able to go out. Sev
eral steamers have had hard trips.
The report stated that six designs had
been submitted and Schmid's model was
considered the most appropriate. Other
competitors were Robert I. Aitken t>f San
Francisco, F. D. Jackson of San Leandro,
Schwind E. Schmitt of this city, Jean
La Veau of San Jose and Miss Sibyl Eas
terday of Niles. It was a close contest
for a time between Schmid and Aitken.
but the committee by a final 10 to 5 vote
decided to take the Schmid model.
The figure shows McKinley with an
overcoat as part of his attire, his hat in
his left hand and his right hand extended
in the form of welcome. ' There is much
minor elaboration which adds to the at
tractiveness of the statue.
The monument will be erected In St.
James Park, at the spot where McKinley
addressed the people of the city last May.
It will cost $13,500. All artists who sub
mitted models were allowed $25 eacb for

germ. He says: "I used Herpicido for my
dandruff and falling hair and I am well
satisfied with the result." Dr. J. t. Fu-

Herplclde for dandruff with excellent re-
sults. I shall prescribe it in my practice "

WALTER MOROSCO DIES SUDDENLY
AT HIS UPPER FRUITVALE HOME
Former 'San Francisco Theatrical - Manager
Passes Away, Supposedly From Heart
Diseaseâ- Absent Sons Hastily Summoned
DEATH came suddenly last night
to "Walter Morosco, the . noted
theatrical man. while â¢ he was
sleeping at his residence, Ger
anium 'place, in Upper Fruitvale.
Mr. Morosco had gone to his room to
rest after enjoying the holiday with his
brothers, Edwin A. Bishop and Henry
Bishop of Chicago, and his nephews, Ed
win J. Bishop and Willard Parry.
Mr. Parry was sitting in an adjoining
room and heard his uncle breathing heav
ily. The young, man went to the bedroom
at S o'clock and noticed that Mr. Morosco
was apparently not breathing. Closer
examination revealed the fact that death
had made its claim. Dr. E. S. Depuy,
who had been attending Mr. Morosco for
a recent slight illness, was called. The
doctor could only say that death had pre
ceded him. ",.
Mr Morosco had been feeling indis
posed for several days, but he was not
so seribuslv ill as to occasion any. alarm.
His sudden death was a severe shock to
those that had been enjoying his hospi
tality. Plans had been made for a gala
time at his home during the Christmas
holidays. .
So far as is now known death came
from heart disease.
Sons Summoned Home.
Mr. Morosco's sons were all away at the
time of his death, Harry Morosco was

From Window to Save
Their Lives. , .
PHILADELPHIA; Dec. 25.â One child
was burned â¢ to death, its parents were
seriously injured and two other young
children were slightly hurt as a result
of a fire at the home of James F. Con
nolly, 3976 Wyalusing avenue, at midnight
to-night. Shortly after the family had re
tired lire was discovered on the first floor
of the house. The flames had gained con
siderable headway and escape by ! the
stairs was cut off. Connolly threw his
two-year-old son and two-months-old
baby out of a second-story window into
the arms of neighbors and the little ones
escaped with slight injuries.
The parents then jumped and were both
badly hurt by striking on their heads on
the stone sidewalk. In the excitement the
four-year-old daughter, Mary, was for
gotten. When the parents realized that
she had not escaped a frantic effort was
made by the firemen to save her. The
house by this time was badly damaged
and after the flames had* been extin
guished the little charred body was found
in a second-story rear room.* It is not
yet known whether the parents will re
cover from their injuries.
Trouble Over Mining' Claims.
' GUTHRIE, O. T., Dec 25.â United
States Indian Agent Randlett of the
Kiowa and Comanche tribes is sending
out notice to all persons who have staked
mining claims in Indian allotments that
they must vacate at once or they will be
ejected by Fort Sill troops. The action is
based upon the opinion of the Attorney
General, approved by Secretary Hitch
cock and sent to the agent under recent
date, prohibiting miners from filing on
Indian allotments.

WELL KNOWN -THEATRICAL MAN
â¢ WHO DIED SUDDENLY YESTER
DAY IN HIS FRUITVALE HOME.
summoned quickly from San Francisco.
Dispatches calling Leslie -Morosco home
from Seattle and Oliver Morosco from Los
Angeles were sent at once.
Mr. Morosco's long and profitable con
nection with San Francisco theatricals
gave him prominence throughout the
United States. He was born about fifty
five years ago at Gullford, Connecticut,
his family name being Bishop. As a young
man he joined a troupe of acrobats, styled
/'the Morosco brothers," and for .years the
circuses of the country had the team on
their bills. Mr. Morosco abandoned the ,
circus and embarked in the theatrical
business. His first move was a remarka
ble one in the history of San Francisco
theatricals. He opened a playhouse in old
Union Hall, then on, Ho ward ;, street,
tween Third and Fourth. It was south of
Market street and t*Â»e old-time". theater,
owners looked with amazement upon the
move. But it was af big success, and led
to the subsequent leasing by Mr. Moros
co of the Grand Opera-house, where he
continued his successes along popular
price lines. For many years Mr. Moros
co, with his son Harry, was at the head
of the Grand Opera-house.
His Benefactions Many.
Several months ago, desiring to retire
from active service, Mr. Morosco disposed
of his theatrical holdings to- a corporation
with which his son Harry is connected.
Since his retirement Mr. Morosco had
been residing at his country home, which
is one of the beautiful places of Oakland
and its suburbs. There the retired man
ager e-njoyed comfort and rest. Among
his pleasures was driving. He was pas
sionately fond of horses, and drove often
a fine team of eight black horses to a
tally-ho. His famous collection of Shet
land ponies was Â»a great attraction. Of
large liberality',. sMr. Morosco's benefac
tions were' many: He took particular de
light in assisting "the work of the asso
ciated kindergartens of Oakland.
There will be nothing done about funeral
arrangements until the absent sons have
arrived...
The relatives are prostrated over the
sudden shock, for the death was most un
expected. Mr. Parry said last night:
"We are simply overwhelmed, for noth
ing was further from our thoughts in this
holiday time than the possibility of the
sudden taking off of my uncle."

COURT AWARDS
HAWAII LAND
Property in the Pearl
Harbor Locality Con- .
demned. â 
United States Is Successful
in First of the Law
suits.
1 HONOLULU, Dec. 18 (via" Victoria, B.
C, Dec. 25.)â The first of the suits brought
by the United States to condemn lands
needed for the naval . station at Pearl
Harbor was decided last week by a jury
in the United States District Court,
which awarded the land to the Govern
ment at a price far below the demands of
the owners..
The case was that of the United States
against the estate of Bernice Pauahi
Bishop, Involving over 600 acres of land
at* the site of the proposed station. The
Bishop estate, in its answer to the suit of
condemnation,' demanded about $600 per
acre for the land, while the Government's
price, was about ?30. The jury brought In
a verdict awarding the. defendants about
$75 per acre. The verdict is taken to indi
cate that tne Government will get land
wanted for a naval station for a small
sum.:' .
A special election held In the Hllo dis
trict last Week to choose a successor to
the late J. E. Waliko, member of. the
House- of Representatives, resulted in the
,. (-lection of James Lewis, who was the de
feated Republican candidate at the for
mer election. The campaign -was a quiet
one. " â¢ :
President Roosevelt's message is com
mented here as averse to tne sugar in
terests of Hawaii. The declaration
against allowing more Chinese to come
here was a.' disappointment to the plan
ters.*: The prospect of reciprocity with
Cuba and the possibility of tree admission
of sugar from that island and the Philip
pines, as well as Porto Rico, are also dis
appointing to Hawaii. In spite of these
inferences, however, the sugar stocks
remain firm.
Attorney General Dole will leave for
Washington in the near future to present
to the. United States Supreme Court the
appeal of the Territory in a case involv
ing'the question of the legality of trials
without Grand Jury indictments under
the Hawaiian law allowing jury verdicts
by nine jurors after an examination.
Two other suits brought by the Gov
ernment have been compromised, the
United States getting the lands without
cost. ' The John II estate agreed to and
has deeded to the Government a strip of
land amounting to twenty-three acres on
Ford- Island, and the suit against the 1 li
estate for the whole of the island has
been withdrawn, as it is held to be un
necessary to take It all. The Oahu Sugar
Company also, surrendered its leasehold
interest in the same land. The suit
against the Oahu Railway . and Land
Company for the lands covered by its
right of way has been settled. The com
pany deeds the land to the Government
with the understanding that its tracks
shall not be disturbed until a new right
of way is provided.
The most important condemnation suit
now pending is against the Honolulu
Plantation Company to secure the com
pany's leasehold interest in the lands of
the Bishop estate already condemned. A
suit against the Dowsett estate for 4SS
acres of this same land is also pending.
GENERAL GOMEZ FARES
POORLY IN POLITICS
He Is Met With Charges of Treachery
and Stones Are Thrown
at Him.
HAVANA. Dec. 25.â According to tele
grams printed in Senor Estrada Palma's
organs. General Gomez is faring badly in
his-', political matters. In' the
: Principe province his meetings have been
â¢ broken up and he has been greeted with
shouts of "Traitor" and stones have been
thrown at him. General Gomez is mount
ed, on the same horse he used during the
war and is accompanied by a band and a
number of veterans. The Maso' feeling is
running strong in Puerto Principe.
The Nacion says Gomez Is paid by the
Government to stump the country. He is
met with that accusation on every hand.
Maso's followers have withdrawn every
one of their candidates and the feeling
at some points is bitter.

Four Passengers. Perish
in Staterooms Before
Aid Arrives.
MEMPHIS. Tenn., Dec. 25.â The steam

an early hour this morning and four lives
were lost. The" dead: . .f.-

The fire was discovered at 4:10 a. m. as
the steamer lay at her wharf here, and
spread with such rapidity that the craft
was a mass of flames when the depart
ment responded to the alarm. 'When the
Sun arrived in port last night from Ful
ton most of the passengers went ashore,
but ten or' a dozen of,. them decided to
spend the night on the boat. Among these
were Mr. ana Mrs. Timbs and baby, Mrs.
Timbs* sister, Miss Josie Hammers, and
Mr. and Mrs. D. N. Rainor. . Miss Ham
mers was sleeping with her sister and the
baby in a stateroom, and when she was
awakened by the smoke she aroused her
sister and started toward an exit. Mrs.
Timbs, however, went back for the baby,
and before she could return the hurricane
deck gave way and escape was cut off.
Miss Hammers got out without injury.
Timbs was in another stateroom, and un
til the collapse of the roof came tried by
every means to reach his wife. Mr. and
Mrs. Rainor had a stateroom, and al
though it was thought that all the pas
sengers on the boat had been saved noth
ing was heard from them until their
charred remains were discovered. "When
! the first body wasftaken out Timbs iden
tified it as his wifcjby a ring worn on her
finger. The body- was horribly burned.
The body of the baby has not been found.
The steamer Sun was the property of
George W. Phillips, who was her captain,
and John- Breiner, who acted as clerk.
The loss to steamer and cargo probably
will reach $20,000. partially Insured.

RIOTERS KEEP
OFFICERS BUSY
Serious Clash Bet^ween
Negroes and Whites
of Harlem.
'NEW YORK, Dep. 25.â A race skirmish
between whites and blacks In Harlem to
day . developed serious proportions and
kept the police busy for a time. The ne
groes, 100 strong, were armed with revolv
ers and clubs, while equally as many
whites used stones and other weapons.
The negroes had the advantage, but were
driven back into their tenements by the
police after they had charged on the
whites with pistols and razors. Fifteen
negroes were arrested. Four whites, in
cluding a policeman, were badly shot or
cut. . .
The rioting began when some white
boys stoned two colored girls, whereupon
a dozen negroes, seized the white boys and
beat them. The boys, when released, told
their story to white men in the vicinity
and an organized attack was made on the
negroes, who were driven back to their
tenements under a shower of stones. The
confusion increased when the white men
began to bombard the tenements with
stones and other missiles and the negroes
fired from their windows into the crowd.
The whites, surprised by the shooting and
seeing men fall wounded, turned and ran.
followed by the negroes, who used knives
and clubs freely.
At this point a squad of policemen ar
rived on the scene and with drawn clubs
stopped the rioting, chasing the negroes
into their houses.

interior of the church was appropriately

SERMON ON THE NATIVITY.
Rev. Father Caraher Preaches on the
Birth of Christ.
"Behold, I bring you tidings of great
j6y that shall be to all the people, for this
day is born to you a Savior, which is
Christ the Lord, in the city of David,"
Luke chapter 2. verses 10-11, was the text
which Rev. Father Caraheis pastor of St.
Francis Church, selected ' for his Christ
man sermon. Father Caraher described
â¢the humble circumstances which sur
rounded the birth of the S3vior of man.
He ppoke in part as follows:
About a mile and a. half to the fast of
Bfthel<Â»m is the grotto of the chepberd. It is
Fltuatetl !n the field of Hoax, -whrre . Ruth
gleaned the ears of corn that had escaped the
hands of the reapem Here it was>, over this
frrotto, that the angels hovered on Christmas
nlrht. Klnginir the word* <>f my text to the
wondering fshepherds. It i* believed that, the
frood ne*'Â« ft the Savior's birth was borne to
the nhepherdu by the angel Gabriel, who an
nrAinced the mystery of the Incarnation to the
Virgin In Xazareth. The evangelist tells us
that thÂ». shepherds went to Bethlehem, where
they found Mary and Joseph, and the Infant
lilts In tbe oiaiiger. Let us to-day journey in
spirit to Bethlehem. We will enter the grotto
of the Nativity, and after grazing upon the
civine infant turn to the lesson that he wishes
to teach.
Unless God himself, or an angel from heaven,
had declared it. we could not believe that this
helpless, shivering infant, whom we find within
the walls of a cheerless, desolate stable, was
the Savior pointed out by the prophecies, the
redeemer of the world. Who would be con
vinced by the sole aid of reason that the ten
der, innocent babe, who " is lying there, sur
rounded* by cattle and other domestic animals,
is the Ions-expected Messiah, the savior of
fallen man?
Is not God wonderful in all his works? Do
not the heavens, earth and every .production of
his hands show forth his glory, his power and
his wisclom? Undoubtedly the wisdom and
power â¢ of God are manifest in every depart
ment and detail of creation, but where is he
more powerful and' glorious than In the na-.
tivity of his son? That son. had he so or-,
dained. could have had a queen'for "his mother
and a king- for his father, instead of the-hum
ble Mary and the lowly Joseph. He could have
been born in a ' palace instead of a cheerless,
desolate cave. He could have been clothed ir.
purple and fine linen instead of living the life
of the poor while he was incarnate. He could
have been surrounded by royal attendants at
his birth instead of by asses and by oxen. But
ihese things he would not do. for it was his
aim and purpose to come into this world lo
fulfill his mission, that of saving fallen mar..
The end and aim of the Incarnation anfl of the
birth of the Son of God was our salvation,
which was wrought chiefly on . Calvary. but
which may be said to have its beginning at
Bethlehem.
Rev. Father Charles McMann acted as
celebrant. Rev. Father T. Caraher as dea
con and Rev. Father E. McGough as sub
deacon. The altar of the church was
decorated with festoons of evergreens and
Christmas berries. An elaborate musical
programme, composed of selections be
fitting the Joyous nature of the occasion,
was rendered at both the late and early
mass. At the 5 o'clock mass Miss Marie
Ryan directed the choir. Miss Daisy Mer
rill and Margaret Stevenot, who sang
solos, acquitted themselves in the most

Society took a day off to~ untie little
ribbons and open dainty parcels yester

the gifts crowded out all ideas, of want

gifts of the yuletide is not surprising, for
the shops never offered a -more: dazzling
array of the "just what I have always
wanted" sort of presents, and the people
never began earlier in tho season to buy
them. AVhcn December arrived many of

mas sermon -at the Cathedral
Mission of the Good Samari
tan yesterday morning.; He
. suited his sermon to the
minds of the Sunday school
children, who attended the
ser%'ices in a body. At the outset of his
sermon he said his remarks would be
very short, as. he believed a Christmas
sermon should be brief.
In a general way Bishop Nichols
brought out â¢ the fact that there was a
great deal of fiction. in regard to Christ
mas and Santa Claus. He imprinted on
tne minds of his- young listeners that it
was the birth" of Christ that was being
celebrated. He told them of the Savior
and pointed out that he : was an actual
man. He said Santa Claus was a myth
and his., coming at this season of the year
was simply told to â¢ children in order to
Impress upon them that an unknown and
not the 'parents .brought : presents for. the
children. The speaker told of Christ, nis
lowly birth, the good he did In the world
and of his death. '

Rev. Dr. Clampett Preaches a Force
. ful Christmas Discourse.
The Christmas music at Trinity Church
was of an unusually impressive character
Rev. Frederick "W". Clampett. rector of
the church, preached from St. John, i:14:
'The Word was- made- fiosh and dwelt
among- us.' He referred to the increas
ing and widening interest of the churches
of the land in the commemoration of the
nativity of the blessed Lord. In part he
said: â  " â¢
Nothing Impresses Itself upon the mind more
than the simplicity of the story of Bethlehem.
It has been told In language of transparent
. beauty. It is an event so striking as to im
press itself upon an entire civilization. And
yet our time is reckoned upon the event, the
eyes of millions are turned in holy love upon
the Infant form ot Bethlehem, and kings and
queens bow, as the wise men of old, before
tho "Word made flesh."
He was likewise sublime.' Truly Â»he
heavens were telling the glory of God. when
the Star guided the first worshiper to Bethie
hem and the angel '.-hnrus Riled the air.
Time has demonstrated Its permanency. The
world was never more prepared to receive and
reverence the message.
Tills message of simplicity, sublimity and
permanency la valued because the child JesuÂ«
was the revelation of the Father. Nothing
short of the divine Incarnation will satisfy tlie
longing soul. Nothing short of the deity of
the Son of God. will harmonize the truths 'of
revelation. Meen may extol the Master as a
pure moralist and unique example of-self-sac
rifice, but in the supreme thought of his ab
solute deity â his oneness with the Father â
rests all that makes the Christian faith a
power. We behold God through the attributes
of Jesus. The majesty, the mercy, compassion,
pity and Infinite love of the Father were re
vtnled through 4he life of Jesus of Nazareth.
His incarnation, again, was the enrichment
of humanity. 1 It was "God manifest In the
flesh." With singular force this truth comes
to us in Chrlstmastlde. It adds sacrednesa
and dignity to manhood. It speaks to us in
the language of St. John: "Behold, now are
we the sons of God, and It doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we- know that when he
shall appear. we shall be like him."
The Christian faith, at this season, speaks
with remarkable power of the Infinite, possi
bilities thus opened out by the life of the
child. Jesus. His humanity has sanctified all
humanity. To this end he came that we might
have r life abundantly. â '
These truths make possible all the joys' of
Christmas. Beneath social and home bleselncs
exchange of gifts and mutual well wishes, is
the one supreme truth of the incarnate Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. "The "Word," verily
"was made flesh and dwelt among- us." -

Mayor-Elect Eugene E. Schmitz Renders a
Violin Saloi at Offertory in St. Mary's
Church â Impressive Services Are Held
AT St. Mary's Cathedral the
music was a. feature, as it has
always been on holidays. The
choir and orchestra, under the
direction of Professor Harri
son, rendered an excellent pro
gramme.
At the 10:30 o'clock mass the
Rev. Chariest A. Ramm
preached the sermon. ; His discourse was
a beautiful one and was of Christmas. In
part he said:
God being a pure spirit the worship of him
is the worship of a pure spirit. Since, however,
â we have never had any experience of spiritual
being,: and cannot, thereto^, even imagine
what they are JJke. this worship of God â
which is our highest religious duty â Is neces
sarily extremely difficult. Worsip is a mental
and intellectual act; the will and mind must
produce it or it does not exist; but aa we can
not think. AX. all without the accompaniment of
figures or images lit the imagination tha
thought of God involved in hia worship must
necessarily be attended by some Image of him.
It. is the difficulty of forming this image which
makes our mental grasp' upon God commonly
so feeble. - You will at once realize what I
mean if you have- ever tried to cultivate de
votion to God the Father or to God the Holy
Ghost. To most people. I am sure, the object
of such devotion will seem illusive, vanishing
before them as they try to fix their mental eyea
upon it. What sort of a mental picture can we
form of thÂ« Holy Ghost?
This initial difficulty of worship springing
from the spirituality of God is increased by a
second, arising from the character of the wor
ship which he requires of us. Worship. I have
said. Is an intellectual act. . But it is more
than that. It is an act of our whole being.
The first and greatest commandment is this:
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy
whole soul, with thy whole heart and with thy
whole mind." Not alone our intellect, but
our feelings, our emotions and our affections
are to have a share in our worship. Without
these the purely mental acts which form the
basis of our love and adoration are- cold and
feeble. It is the heart which gives to worship
Intensity and color and warmth.
When our feelings run along with our will
religious acts are easy. When they are ab
sent or contrary it takes all our'resolutlon and
courage to remain faithful to our duty. One
half our being seems then to be rebelling
against the other half; and generally, in the
end, If the conflict be long, our mental powers
lose their grasp and we are swept away by
the persfstent current of our feelings.
Yet these feelings are a part of our strange
little being. Powerful aids they are for good
when they respond divinely to some noble in
spiration; flemon furies when perverted to the
cause of sin. They are God's gifts to us. and
he asks us to bring them to his service, so
that our whole being, spiritual ana physical,
may offer him one harmonious homage, i â 
But how can we bring our hearts to serve
him? Can the thought of the Invisible spirit.
God. who is everywhere and yet nowhere, warm
us with the glow of fervor? Can an imma
terial being kindle emotions within us? Can
the fingers of our affections twine around that
which we cannot even imagine? â 
The kind heart need3 the tangible, the vis
ible, the present, the concrete to move It. The
absence of these from the pure spirituality of
God Snade the worship of him in the olden time
doubly hard. It is for this reason that his
chosen people could with the utmost dlfflculty
be made to cleave to the theism which it was
their mission to preserve. They wanted to see
and feel their God, and so fell an easy prey
to the Idolatry of their heathen neighbors.
When- Moses delayed In coming; down from the
mountain the people forgot the Lord whose
prophet he was, -and cried out to Aaron:
"Arise, make us gods that may go before us."
It was but the strong cry of their sensible
nature drowning the somber' but weak voice
of reason. .
So it was throughout their history. They
were constantly falling away: and It was only
by the direct punishments that God could hold
them, even to a fitful, cold and feeble worship.
But surely a merciful Father will at length
have pityupon this weakness of human nature.
He will not always remain far aw&y from his
children. He will not always wile by fear;
he will come to them; be wilt win them to
himself, and hold them by the cords of Adam,
by the bonds of love.
Jesus lives to-day en every altar. He Is
there, the same gracious Savior who had com
passion on the multitude' in the wilderness;
who brought Mary Magdalen weeping and peni
tent to his feet;' -whose touch healed the sick
who comforted the grief-stricken widow of
Nain ; who wept at the tomb of Lazarus and
whose look of reproach brought the bitter tears
of repentance to the eyes of Peter.
The doors of his temple are always open,' in
viting us to enter and fall down before him
in silent adoration. There. In hia presence
our hearts grow warm again, our strength is
renewed and our courage revived. There our
difficulties of worship are solved and the Irre
pressible cravings of our nature to feel our
Savior near us find their answer. He has not
condemned us to wander over the face of the
earth, like Cain, with the curse of our slnÂ«
upon us. For we know where he la and we
may arise and go to him and cast our burden
upon him, as Martha's sister did when hÂ»
heart was heavy. u * r

Rev. Father Wyman preached tho
Christmas sermon. His text was taken
from St Luke ii:15: "Let us go ovei
to Bethlehem and let us see this word
that is come to pass which the Lord hath
shown to us." In part he said:
I Ruskin in his beautiful essay. "The JIj-3
1 tery of Lift>." says, "In the cloud of the hu
man soul there la a fire stronger than the
lightning and a grace more precious than
rain." But as in nature there are c!outl3 in
the sky which are only of vanishing vapory
and pass away, clouds that are mere shadows^
fantastical and spectral. clouds that are
threatening, carried by the tempest, yet are
dissolved only into mist, so In the human soul
there are the painted clouds of the imagina
tion, the dark barren clouds oÂ£ passion which
bring forth no precious rain of grace.
What la this soul-fire? It is the desire for
and the hope or expectation of something bet
ter. And what is this grace' more precious
than rain? It is the fulfillment of thfa desire,
the actual attainment of this gift, which only
thÂ»> Author of Life can bestow.
Is this desire universal with men? Before
answering this question I must make a. dis
tinction. Potentially, yes; in actual exercise,
not always. There are both light and dark
ness in the human soul and the former ia made
brighter by contrast with the latter. If I
should ask any man. woman or child whom I
might chance to meet. Is there anything that
you want? I should soon discover in every In
stance that there was something which they
were seeking but had not yet attained. That
something might be a mere trifle, and the-etn
we find an explanation of why the wildernesses
and deserts of the soul are extensive and why
there are so many spiritual springs, wella and
river beds run dry.
Faith tells us that thÂ« One who was born
en this day is to every child of Adam a "dar
epring from on high"â tha "Eternal Word"'*
who was in the beginning before all thing?,
who wan with God. who was God. who was
the one by whom all things are made.

IS EVERY DAY ASSUMING GREATER IMPORTANCE
Immense Mineral Resources of -the Several
Northern Counties Are Giving Redding
Proud Place Among Cities of the State.
Smelters Belch Smoke Day and Night
THE phenomenal advance nf
Redding, the county seat of
Shasta County, is of moment
to the entire State. Last
year Shasta County produced
minerals, as officially report
ed by the State Mineralogist.
to the high aggregate of
55,574,026. The total for the
entire State of California during the same
period was $32,622,545. Roughly speaking.
Shasta, therefore, is to be credited with i
more than one-sixth of the whole value I
of all minerals which California added to '
the wealth of the world in the year 1900. ;
Gold, silver and copper, like a trinity of
genii slumbering in the hills of Shasta
answering to the Aladdin-like touch of
energy, came forthâ glittering and potent
â while the mountains quaked and rever
berated. Their allied wealth gladdened
the hearts of the sturdy miners of the
north and pointed the way to a future
that looks very bright.
Along the water courses, along the high
ways leading- from Redding to the coun
ties of Siskiyou, Trinity and Modoc, in
the bed of the Sacramento River and
other streams; in the depths of high
mountains, Enterprise groped her way.
The mines of an earlier and historic day,
in which the pioneers found treasure,
were again exploited for gold, but cop
per is the new giant of the north. Gold
is still a factor in Shasta and a large one.
The total output of the county in gold
last year was $733,467, and only seven coun
ties in California made a better gold
record, but the value of Shasta copper
was $4,166,735, which was more than the
values in gold output of any two counties
combined. Copper is king of the present
and near future.
Day and night, unceasingly, vaporous
cloujs float, banner-like, over the smelt
ers of Keswlck, in full view of Redding.
Something like a score of miles farther
removed the unceasing fires of Bully Hill
are reducing the flinty ores, copper bear
ing, of another belt or region â rich in
mineral wealth. On the line of the rail
road going to Oregon is Kennett, in which
there is great promise. tBalaklala is an
other name to conjure with in this fa
vored county of Shasta, The Mountain
Copper Company's operations at Keswick
end De La Mar's at Bully Hill have al
ready given rise to communities of some
.size. Other hamlets and towns, thriving
and vigorous, will come into existence In
the rear futureâ wherever and whenever
the magic hand of copper points the way
and marks the time on the dial. The pres
ent prospect Is that each and all of these
communities within a wide radius of
Redding will for a long term of years
enhance the prosperity and growth of
Redding, while other places are also pres
ent gainers. m
IN COMMANDING POSITION.
Sends Supplies to a Region of Great
Richness.
In a certain degree Redding occupies the
tame relative position to the surrounding
mining country that Sacramento held in
regard to the placers in early days. It is
a supply point and center of distribution.
Stage routes radiate in all directions.
Over the grades, up hill and down, over
bridges, by the rivers and through, the
mountains, the teamsters crack their
whips as their dusty horees carry in and
out machinery for the mines, boilers and
pumps, ores for the smelters and all the
miscellaneous supplies needed at the
mines. The stage routes from Redding
i ead to all points north in Shasta County,
"%o points in Modoc, Sigkiyou and Trinity
I ounties. At a general stage office the
following 1 named localities are enumerated
as being reached regularly by stage ser
vice from Redding:
Anderson. Adin, Alturas. Bear Valley, Bie

With the commanding station of gate
way to the heart of a great mining region
large benefits have come to Redding dur
ing the last few years, and are still swell
ing her wealth. There is not room enough
in the city for the people who have gone
ihere recently to dwell. In the suburbs
people have been camping in wagons and
tents waiting for houses to be finished to
accommodate them. Parties who expect
ed to have houses have compromised on
having a few rooms. Nevertheless there
has been a. great deal of building- in progr
ess recently. The value estimated to be
'represented by buildings in progress at
one time very lately was. $250,000. At this
time two new hotels are being added. One
of these Is a brick four-story structure,
to contain 340 rooms. This is built with
money taken from the mines of- Trinity
County. The other new hotel mentioned is
of wood, three stories high, which stands
on the corner of Butte and Oregon streets.
The Shasta County Bank has a new and
costly home on Market street, between
Yuba and Placer. Office and store blocks
are in construction. Many cottages have
been built. Real estate agents are fore
seeing the coming of a greater population
and are placing large tracts of eligible
lands on the market for building sites.
City improvements will undoubtedly be
made on a large scale.
MOUNTAIN COPPER PLANT.
Millions in Bed Metal Annually Pro
duced at Keswick.
The nearest of the great copper plants
to Redding is that of the Mountain Cop
per Company at Keswlck. The force of
men employed there has ranged as high
as 1500. M. E. Dittmer says that the
Mountain Copper Company is producing
at the rate of $4,500,000 per year, and that
the Bully Hill Copper Mining and Smelt
ing Company, of which J. R. de la Mar
Is the moving spirit, has a present an
nual rate of production of $2,750,000, which
will .be doubled soon by the Increase of
nmelters. Every visitor to Redding who
has time at his disposal visits Keswlck.
Very few ever are permitted to enter the
grounds inclosing the great plant, but
that is not necessary to comprehend the
greatness of the enterprise, lor the hills
surround the smelters, and from any point
a good view is obtainable.
The mine is away up on the mountain
side. Thirteen miles of track are em
ployed by the railway trains to bring
ACTING MAYOR ROHM MAKES
FORECAST OF ADVANCEMENT
THERE is no boom in Redding. The conditions' are those of perma
nency. Redding relies upon the mines for her prosperity, at least in
a very large degree. The reliance Indicated is based on knowledge of
the proximity of great deposits of ore at Keswick, Bully Hill, Bala
klala, Kennett, Clear Creek, Harrison Gulch and other loc;ftities. Redding
has a great forwarding business, which is hers by^ right of situation as re
lated to the surrounding country. There are two large lumber districts trib
utary to Redding. One is centered at Bella Vista; the other is in the coun
try about Sisson.
There is no doubt that we have a progressive population in Redding. The
present Board of Trustees of the city was elected upon the programme of
bonding to furnish better streets and a sewer system. So rar that has not
been carried out, but there is no doubt that public sentiment favors putting
the .city in the best possible shape to attract outsiders of the desirable sort
to become permanent residents. A part of the programme Is to build a city
hall and to set out shade trees along the streets for beautification and also for
comfort of the passers.
This is still a comparatively new city, but there are evidences that citi
zens of the most progressive type have settled here, and that Redding has
the favoraoi- consideration of the keenest men in California. .It also has
the advantage of a world-wide reputation as the city nearest the great cop
per mines that have been opened up in this county in^the past few years.
These are factors that count for advancement. ..
We have a free reading room and library, good schools, good hotels, good
prospects in all directions and advantages to match, so that -we have no rea
son to doubt that we shall reap a full harvest and that all who make their
homes with us will have reason to be thankful that they came here to share
with us what we have.- The enterprising spirit of Reddirtg may be relied upon
to push-this city forward constantly. / J. T. ROHM,
President of Redding Board of Trustees.'
down the ore from the mine, and the
trains are rarely quiet. The works are
operated by two shifts of men, so that
the work never ceases. â  To have what is
technically known as a "freeze up" costs
money. Outside of the gates of the op
erating plant the town has grown up. It
is of unpainted houses for the greater
part, all perched upon hills, for the
ground floor of Keswlck is extremely
broken. This town has a ' recent origin.
The population is estimated at about 1200.
The stages run to and from Keswick three
times daily. Vegetation fades away be
fore the fumes of the smelters. Two miles
distant the ; forest trees are , dead and
withered, but the men, women and chil
dren in Keswlck appear to thrive. The
pay roll at Keswick amounts to about
$250,000 per month. The price paid for

the Keswick property is reported to have
been $200,000. The present capitalization
is $6,500,000. Last year the dividends
amounted to $1,125,000. lue British cap
italists owning the property are making
a very fine thing out Of their investment.
The De La Mar mines, at Bully Hill,
have given rise to two settlements, Cop
per City and Sallee. The two have a pop
ulation of something like 1500, according
to the local claims. The town of De La.
Mar belongs to a stock company. It is
about one year old. Stores, a schoolhouse,
one church, a weekly paper, four hotels
(one of which Is three stories high), a
butcher shop, laundry, lodging-houses,
etc., are the features of this struggling,
one-year-old Infant Copper City, which
promises to be much larger. The De La
Mar mines are shipping largely to New
Jersey, where Mr.De La Mar has con
structed a refining plant on a large scale.
PROMISE BIG BETTJBNS.
Many Mining Properties Hold Out
Fine Promises.
It is manifestly impossible to describe
all the multitude of mining properties in
Shasta County. There are great hopes
of the future of Balaklala and Kennett.
The Mount Shasta Gold Mines Corpora
tion is operating the old Mount- Shasta
gold mine, which has a: record of having
sent $25,000 per month to . the Keswick
smelters. Among the prominent mining
districts is Harrison Gijlch, already well
known to fame. The great operations at
the Sweepstakes mine, in- Trinity County,
are bringing profit to Redding. One con
tract for teaming pipe in to the mines
amounted to $35,000, the contractor, being
a Trustee of Redding. Between Redding
and Keswick gold dredging operations are
under way. â¢
It is a great sight when the teams that
are to travel over the country roads with
supplies for distant mines and mining
camps and towns are loaded up in the
square facing the railroad freight sheds
on one side and' a principal business street
of Redding bn the other. One needs to
travel no farther to see how things were
done in the pioneer days, when men re
lied upon their own energies to cover the
distances to the mines. There have been
counted as many as 150 freighting teams
in the square in one afternoon. The men
are sunburned and hardy â tough, as a
knot, and at once plucky and good
humored. You will see them later in the
day, if you ride abroad, making their
noonday meal at some small town or by
the roadside. Redding appreciates to the
full the advantage of the possession of
this service of freighting teams to bring
business to it. Equally with, the miners,
the stage drivers and the teamsters are
making the city grow.
There Is a good story going the rounds
which illustrates the avidity with which
eligible mining properties in Shasta Coun
ty are now sought. According to this the
Mountain Copper Company had the Bala
klala mine under bond for $200,0C0. On
the day that the bond expired the man
ager of the Copper Mining Company tele
phoned the owners to come out and get
$15,000, the amount required to keep the
bond alive under renewal. They did not
respond. The money was not sent to
them: In ninety days the property was
sold for $450,000 to Philadelphians, a win
ning for the owners of $250,000 In three
months by waiting. â  \
During a recent suit in court in Red
ding Mr. Cohen, manager of the Bully
Hill property, made a statement under
oath that the profits of the Bully Hill,
were $100,000 per month; The price paid
for the property by the present owners \%
reported to have been $250,000. * â â¢.-â¢â 
One more statement of interest should
be made concerning the mines of Shasta
County as a whole. This ia derived from
the annual report of the State Mineralo
gist, who finds that the total output in
creased from $4,661,981 in 1899 to $5,574,026 in
1900, the difference in favor of the last
year being $912,045. The present year will
show another large, gain. No one believes
that the price of copper, which has fallen
as a result of manipulation, will be as low
for any length pf time as it has been're
cently. The multiplication of electrical
uses makes the demand for copper larger
all the time. Conditions will be more fa
vorable in the matter of prices after a
time, a consideration... which 1 vitally af
fects one of the largest copper belts on
earth, that of Shasta County.

Redding Holds the Fourth Place as
. Freight Distributing Point.:
Local estimates and .the figures of. the
Southern. Pacific Company give Redding
the position of being the fourth forward
ing point in California. .The freights mov
ing- between â¢ Redding and. Keswick alone
are of sufficient bulk to give. rise to a plan
for the: construction- of an electric ' road
between the two points. The movers in
this enterprise .are R. G. Parker, T. D.
Boardman and George C. Boardman, all
of whom are well known in San Fran

into the matter of making the road pay
and is satisfied, after a full Investigation,
that there is money in it. The route may
involve bridging the Sacramento River at
two places. Mr. Parker has been resid
ing some time In Redding, where he has
opened up the Boardman addition to Red
ding and has energetically "pushed the
sale of many lots, for which a good de
mand has been found. The Southern Pa
cific Company's road does not go near
the smelters at Keswick. Mr. 1 Parker says
that in that fact Is a promise of business
for an electric road. He also thinks it
probable that the road would have the

EDITOR SWASEY SEES SIGNS
OF GREATNESS FOR REDDING
THE United States census of 1900 , placed . Redding's population ap
:" proximately at 3000. Since the census was, taken at least 1000 more
persons have taken up their residence here. Within the next five
j years we will have a population of 10,000. Mining is the leading: in
dustry. Our ores being base in their nature; their treatment never met with
much success until the smelter was introduced .by an English company
which purchased the celebrated Iron Mountain Mine, a vast deposit of cop
per, sold and silver. :
:' Since then the county has advanced from the . sixth to the leading or first
county in the State as a mineral producer. "We have .now two smelting
plants with a prospect of two more in .the near. future.: It has been posi
tively'ascertained that, beginning at Keswick, on the Sacramento River, we
have a continuous copper deposit in the form of a horseshoe, for fifteen
miles, reaching to the town of De La Mar.'near PifRiver, with spurs there
from. -...-..
Redding Is not only the center of this rich mineral belt, but is also the
distributing point for Trinity County, which has become famous for her
rich placer mines, surpassing any county in the State for her extensive and
rich gravel deposits. Add to this the timber resources of the ' county of
Shasta and the rapid and continuous growth of Redding Is certain. ,

REC0R.D OF GROWTH.
History 'of the Town Is One of G-feat
â  '. :â "..;â¢â¢ Advancement. ,
The history of Redding Is typical. It was
laid out by the railroad surveyers and was
named â  after Joseph D. Redding,. \ once
prominent in the councils of the Southern
Pacific Company. The first railroad train
reached Redding bn the night of Sunday,
September 1, 1872. The railway office in

the new place was opened for business on
-he following day. A. S. Castle estabb
lished the first boarding accommodations,
in a large tent. Judge C. C. Bush began
the first substantial Improvement, erect
ing a frame store building on the corner
of California and Butte streets, the site
of the present Bush block.
Mhe inherent vitality of Redding was
demonstrated when the railroad was ex
tended to Oregon, which furnished a test
concerning Redding's ability to retain its
hold upon the forwarding trade. .Red
ding did not suffer in the least. The re
moval of the county seat to Redding
from Shasta was authorized by the coun
ty in 1SS8.
â An estimate is made .that 30,000,000
pounds â  of freight are annually un
loaded at the Redding depot.
Redding is lighted by electricity. The
business structures in the center of the
city are constructed of brick. The streets
are wide and easy of grade. . The Sacra
mento River is spanned by a free bridge,
which facilitates travel very largely.
From many points in the city Mount
Shasta looms up grandly and other
snowy mountains are also in sight. There
are many nice residences. The most
prominent building in the city Is the
County Courthouse. This structure was
erected in 188S at a cost of , $60,000. Two
handsome buildings are owned by fra
ternal organizations, the Temple Hotel
building being the property of the Ma
sonic Building Association, while the Odd
Fellows own a business block.
There are two sets of public officials in
Redding. The Board of Trustees of the
city consists of Dr. J. T. Rohm, president
of the board and acting Mayor; Carl R.
Briggs, H. Clineschmidt, Samuel Hill and
William Welch. The county officials in
Redding are- Superior Judge Edward
Sweeney. Sheriff Charles ~H. Behrens.

INTERESTS ARE VARIED.
Lumber and Cattle Industries Add to
. Shasta County's Welfare.
Mining 'is not the' only large Interest of
Shasta County. Fruit growing has been
successfully followed at Anderson, which
Is twelve miles south of Redding. -At
Bella Vista, twelve miles east from Red
ding, is the headquarters of the Terry
Lumber Company, which has a vast lum
ber output in sugar pine and yellow pine
principally. Burney Valley, situated
sixty-six miles northeast from Redding,
is a good agricultural country. There are
also agricultural and stock interests at
Burgess, fifty-five miles northeast from,
Reddirg. The Shasta King, Balaklala
and Stowell groups of mines are near
Copley, on the railroad, nine miles north
from Redding, 'on the Sacramento River.
Cottonwood is a good shipping point. It
is eighteen miles from Redding. The soil
la productive. At French Gulch there are
good mining properties. A daily stage
connection Is maintained with Redding.
There are excellent mining prospects at
Gas Point, Hart, Whltehouse, Igo, Knobâ
which latter is the postofflce name for
Harrison Qulchâ Middle Creek, Oak Run,
Shasta, Shlngletown, Whiskytown and
Still water.
The mineral springs and health resort3
of Shasta County are famous.
The Redding local papers give an ac
count of a railroad which is now project
ed for the purpose of connecting' Fall
River Mills with the Southern Pacific
main line. The company concerned in
the project la the Shasta Mineral Belt
Railway, of which r>. P. Doak of St.
Louis is the president. Two routes are
offeredâ one following the Pit River from
its junction with the Sacramento River,
three miles above Kennett, and the other
extending from Bella Vista, the terminus
of the Terry road. The purpose alleged
Is to push on through Modoc County
with this line.
The historic town of Shasta is gradual
ly being merged into the corporate exist
ence of Redding by the simple process of
migration. People who were formerly
dwellers in Shasta are now leading citi
zens in Redding. They and their house
hold goods have gone to Redding for fhe
greater number of advantages afforded by
the larger community. The stores of
Shasta are now nearly all closed. Dur
ing the last year the only hotel of Shasta
has succumbed. Various business places
have followed suit. The old-time stores
are represented only by unoccupied brick
buildings. The former store windows are
covered by iron blinds, or shutters, that
are never taken down now. A few of the
old residents remain. The oldest of these
in point of years of residence is probably
Mrs. C. N. Knox, who has resided in
Shasta continuously ever since 1852. Else
where the story is told erf the taking
away of the county seat to Redding.
Over the principal street of Shastaâ tha
town is mainly all upon one â¢ streetâ the
teamsters drive constantly on their way
to Whiskytown. Weaverville and other
points, where there ia a demand for sup
plies. Shasta Is the oldest town In North
ern California. Once it was the center of
great mining activity. No one can safely
say that it will not again become promi
nent. The copper discoveries that have
given Shasta County its present -leading
position among the mineral counties of
California were not known a few years
ago. Other discoveries are probable.
It was in Shasta, in 1850, that the first
public meeting was held at which the or
ganization of Shasta County was pro
posed. Then Shasta County embraced an
area 200 miles square, extending from the
Oregon State line on the north to Red
Bluff on the south and from the summit
of the Coast Range Mountains on the
west to the Sierra Nevada Mountains on
the east. County officers were elected for
Shasta County on October 7, 1850, which
was about one month after the bill was
passed by the National. Congress admit
ting California as a State of the Union.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
FOR more than a generation there has been no
amendment to the constitution of the United
States. After adopting such changes in the
fundamental law of the republic as were needed to
settle the issues of the civil war, the people have been
content to carry on the Government under the con
stitution without further alteration. The content
ment, howeve-, has been by no means unanimous.
With each succeeding Congress there have come ef
forts toward amending the constitution and some of
them have received strong support in the House.
This Congress is to be no exception to the rule.
Already several amendments have been suggested,
and some of them may be urged with sufficient force
to become questions of practical politics.
As a matter of course we have a revival of the old
issue of amending the constitution with resptct to
the election of United States Senators. This time,
however, in addition to the plans heretofore proposed
there is a new one advocated by Senator Burrows.
He proposes that when the Legislature of a State
fails to elect a United States Senator the people of
the State shall have z right to elect by direct vote.
The measure is designed to remedy such evils as now
exist in Delaware, which State has no representative
in the Senate by reason of the prolonged Legislative
deadlocks.
An amendment likely to receive considerable favor
is that proposed by Senator Stewart giving the Fed
eral Government authority to control and regulate
for irrigation purposes the waters of rivers flowing
through two or more States. It is believed that un
less some such amendment be adopted it will be im
possible to carry out any comprehensive plan for the
.irrigation of the arid lands lying within the bounda
ries of the States.
The advocates of uniform marriage laws have be
fore Congress an amendment offered by Mr. Gillett
of Massachusetts, providing that Congress shall have
power to establish uniform laws on the subject of di
vorce throughout the United States. The evils re
sulting from the existing differences regarding mar
riage and divorce in the various States have long
been a cause of confusion to lawyers and to courts.
The need of some remedy for them has been repeat
edly pointed out, and the American Bar Association
has made an effort to. bring about the enactment of
something like uniform laws by the State Legisla
tures. Such efforts, however, have effected but little
in the way of reform, and it is therefore not strange
that the more earnest promoters of the movement
should new seek to accomplish it by giving the Fed
eral Government power to act for the whole country.
â , An amendment likely to give rise to much discus
sion is that proposed by Mr. Crumpacker of Indiana,
providing that "Congress shall have power to tax
the capital stock and earnings of all private corpora
tions carried on for the purposes of gain, without re
gard to the population of the States, and such tax
may be progressive." The amendment has a double
object. First it would enable the United States Gov
ernment to levy an income tax on corporations, and
second, by means of such tax it could exert control
over the huge aggregations of capital known as
trusts. The proposed amendment will doubtless be
keenly debated, but there is not much likelihood of
its passage, particularly at this time when the Gov
ernment has a larger revenue than it has any need
for. : -jy
Experience has shown that the people never make
amendments to the constitution for slight causes.' It
took the strain of the civil war to wring consent to
the amendments which grew out of that strife. We
have no strain upon us now, and consequently most
of the proposed amendments will hardly have much
support either in Congress or out of it. When once
the vast work of preserving the forests and conserv
ing the water supply of the West is fairly undertaken
such constitutional amendments as are needed to car
ry it out may be provided, but the repeated failures
of efforts to amend the method of electing United
States Senators seem to prove that the other amend
ments proposed will hardly do more than furnish
subjects for constitutional debates.
The California orange-growers' have had. their
little fight with frost and have won out, and now the
Florida growers have to tackle the same cold propo
sition. .
LACK OF LOCOMOTIVES.
COMPLAINTS made/by the orange growers
of Southern California against the railroads
for an inefficient service in the transportation
of fruit direct attention once more to. an evil which
seems to affect every part of the Union. It appears
the railway managers have been so much occupied
during the .past year in reorganizing, the. roads, and.
manipulating stocks that they have â¢ permitted the
equipments of the reads to run down, and conse
quently have been unable to handle the "traffic- of
fered them by the industries of the country.
Infcie East complaints of the lack of transportation
facilities have been frequent and insistent. Again and
again our exchanges have noted instances of large
factories refusing orders for work solely because they
could not get the railroads to haul their freight. In
one case a large coaling company in Virginia found
itself unable to supply even its regular customers
with coal, and as a "-esult something like a coal fam
ine was threatened over a wide district .of country.
So serious was the evil that it was reported the com
pany thought of applying to the Federal Government
to compel the railroads to furnish cars for its inter
state trade. â¢'â "':. * <A_
Many of our Eastern exchanges after investigating
the trouble have reached the conclusion that the
deficiency is due more to a lack of locomotives than
to a lack of cars. It, is said' that if the railroads had
engines enough to handle their traffic they could in
crease the rapidity of the movement of trains suf
ficiently to make the cars do double the service they
now do. That view seems to be confirmed by the
complaint of the orange growers, who among other
deficiencies of the service allege that in many cases
this season it has taken twenty-five days to transport
a car of oranges to New York and eighteen days to
Chicago, when the distance should have been covered
in less than half the time. It'is clear that if prompt
runs had been made the cars "might have been used'
twice or perhaps thrice in the time consumed in car
rying a single load to market.
It is not likely the roads will be caught next sea
son with so deficient an equipment as that which
they now have. The recent combinations, have prob
ably settled railroad organizations and control for
some years to come, and consequently the managers
will have more time 'to devote to the equipment of
the roads. Furthermore it has been noted that the
orders given for cars and locomotives have this year
been- extraordinarily targe. Next season, then, will
find all the roads with many more cars and loco
motives than they now possess. That fact, however*
will not help the shippers of this year. It therefore
behooves railroad commissions and others having au
thority to do what they can to urge the railroad man
agers to exert their utmost energies to supply the
needs of the time. '
Reports frorJi Great Britain are to the effect that
there would probably have been a congestion of
business along the main railway lines there but for
the adoption of electric trains to handle local trade,
thus leaving the heavy trains free to carry the
through traffic. The use of electric traction has'en
abled the British roads to keep light freights in al
most continuous movement, and a recent estimate
based on the service on the Midland Railroad of Eng
land is said to show that by doing away with infre
quent and heavy trains and maintaining frequent light
trains moving at an average speed of forty miles an
hour foF its entire traffic, the capacity of the road
could be practically doubled.
So successful have these experiments been that
it is believed by some experts that freight movement
by heavy, slow trains will soon be almost entirely
superseded by the continuous movement of light
trains. If that sanguine expectation be fulfilled the
orange growers will not have in the future any com
plaints to make on the score of delay in delivering
fruit to market. Certainly something will have to be
done. A railroad that requires twenty-five days to
haul oranges from California to New York is prac
tically worth very little more to the" fruit trade than
air ox train.
The very fact that the British military authorities
in South Africa are to abandon the concentration
camps is a proof that they have been found too de
structive to human life to be longer defended against
criticism; but the critics will now have a right to ask
why they were not abandoned before so much loss
of life occurred and before the criticisms became so
keen. j}
SUFFRAGE IN THE SOUTH.
TWO resolutions relating to the suppression of
the negro vote in several of the Southern States
are now before the House of Representatives.
One of these is the Crumpacker .resolution, Which
was introduced at the last Congress but not acted
upon. The Other, a resolution by Moody of Massa
chusetts, differs in many respects^from the Crum
packer resolution and is believed to be more likely
to obtain support from the Republican majority.
Either of them, however, will suffice to bring the
Southern arid the negro questions once more before
the country as matters of national politics, and con
sequently there are sure to be serious objections
from all who are opposed to a revival of sectional
issues unless it can be shown that they work an in
jury to the nation as a whole and that a definite and
effective remedy can be provided by Congress.
â¢ The difference^ between the two resolutions is a
wide one. That of Mr. Crumpacker assumes that the
colored population in several of the Southern States
has been suppressed and proceeds to reduce the rep
resentation in Congress from those States in propor
tion to the disfranchisement of the population. ' The
Moody resolution is one of inquiry. It does not ac
cept the validity of the Southern suffrage acts, and
asks an investigation into their constitutionality. If
the acts be found invalid they will^be declared null
and void. ; If they be found to be valid Congress will
be asked to reduce the representation from those
States where disfranchisement prevails, in accord
with the provisions of the fourteenth amendment.
It is said the Southern members of Congress are
not at all afraid of the. Crumpacker bill. They are â 
sanguine it will not be supported by the whole body
of 'Republicans in the House, while it will be opposed
solidly by the Democrats. The Moody resolution,
on the other hand, they regard as dangerous. It will
bring up a on the constitutionality of the
Southern suffrage laws, and on that question not only
would .the "Republicans be united, but many North
ern Democrats would vote with them. In fact, one
Northern Democrat, Mr. Thayer of Massachusetts,
has already said: "The stupidity of the Southern
people in bringing the suppression of the negro vote
so squarely before Congress passes all bounds." He
holds that the Louisiana suffrage law, for example,
is unconstitutional and that the Supreme Court will
so decide. He for one, therefore, will not follow
the Southern lead.
.In the South .the new resolution has excited much
more discussion, than that of Mr. Crumpacker. The
THE SAN FRANCISCO '; CALL; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1901.
prevailing opinion in that "section seems to be that
it would be better to lose representation in Congress
than to have the suffrage laws declared unconstitu
tional. Georgia, for example, has not disfranchised
negroes and would have nothing to lose in the way
of representation should it be determined to enforce
the provisions of the fourteenth amendment, and yet
the Atlanta Constitution says: "The critics of those
Southern -States, that have adopted the educational
qualification' may be sure of one thing â that those
States will not be driven from their convictions of
What is best by any threatened or actual. reduction of
representation in Congress."
Another view of s the case was presented by a
prominent business man of South Carolina, who,
when asked what he thought of a loss of represen
tation on the part of that State, replied. , "Our repre
sentatives are worth so little it would make no , dif
ference to the State if we lost all."
Whatever view be taken of the question/two
things are certain: First, that the constitutionality
of the various suffrage acts will have to be decided
by the Supreme Court and not by Congress; and*
second, that a. revival of/sectional or racial issues in
this country would be deplorable. Congress, there
fore,, might well wait for the decision of the Supreme
Court. It will then be. time' to act, and the issue
could be settled once and for all without' a prolonged
agitation. * ; 'â ' .
.There has been a scheme in New York to get Cor
nelius Vanderbilt to run against Perry Belmont for
Congress this â¢ fall, but unfortunately it has fallen
through and the boys will not have the flush tinies
they expected when the campaign "opens.
ONCE more a returning Christmas season finds
the peace of the world more seriously dis
turbed by the British and the Boers than by
any other peoples. Our strife in the Philippines and
Russia's aggressions in- Manchuria seem as nothing
in comparison with the struggle in South Africa,
where two civilized aud Christian races are fighting
for supremacy. On each side there are earnest ad
vocates of' peace, but their voices are lost in the
shouts of the / combatants fighting on one side for
empire and on the other for national independence.
Lord Kitchener has not eaten his Christmas dinner
in peace, nor even in comfort. Dewet, Botha and
the other daring .and energetic leaders of the Boers
were never more active than now, and the British
commanders seem at last to have acquired about as
much activity as the Boers themselves. The sur-.
prises of the war are no longer all on one side., The
later reports contain almost as many accounts of
Boer laagers surprised by British troops as of British
outposts surprised by the Boers.
Since the contemptuous rejection of Kitchener's
proclamation calling upon them to surrender there
appears little probability of any yielding upon the
part of theBoers so long as any considerable number
of them are possibly able to keep the field. On the
other hand the- Chesterfield speech of Lord Rose
bery put an end to all hopes that a responsible Brit
ish statesman would undertake the task of restoring
peace by conceding self-government to the men
whom the British seem determined to treat as rebels.
Before Rosebery made his speech a strong section
of the Liberal party had met in convention at Derby
and adopted resolutions favoring the removal of Lord
Milncr frpm South Africa and the concession of vir
tual independence to the Transvaal and Orange Free
State. Had Rosebery taken the same course there
might have been a union of the Liberal party that
could have forced the Ministry to yield at least some
thing for peace. As it is, however, Rosebery remains
a leader without a following and the Liberals a party
without a leader. Practically there is no opposition,
and Chamberlain can go on his course unrestrained.
. It is a doleful Christmas for the men of both
armies. The frequency and the fierceness of the
skirmishes fought during this week show that neither
side feels any relaxation of the spirit of war. The.
fight increases in bitterness and threatens to become
something like a war which will end only by the
extermination of the weaker party. It is another il
lustration to the world that the price of empire is
high, but the strong nations will pay little heed to
the lesson.- It is to be a long time yet before men
will see the realization of peace on earth.
Up to date the claims for damage filed with the
Spanish Claims Commission amount to more than
$6o,ooo,ooo, so the talk about the surplus in the'
treasury may be premature after all.
LESSONS IN SAFE-CRACKING.
ANEW YORK newspaper recently published
an instructive lesson in the art of blowing
. open a safe with nitroglycerine, and the article
has been -promptly lepublished by the evening rail
road organ in this city. The lesson given is easy to
learn, for rot a single detail, of the operation is omit
ted. It explain* to the uninitiated just exactly at
what point a safe can be best attacked, what tools
to use, how to apply them, liow to introduce the
explosive and how to explode it so as. to leave the
safe open to the exploiter. .
The information contained in the article may be
needed by the readers of the New York paper, for
some of them may have been playing the lamb on
Wall street and cannot get their money back without
a resort to burglary. Just why the railroad organ
should republish it, however, â¢ is not . clear, . for the
railroad itself does not have to resOrt to such crude
methods as safe-cracking in order to get other peo
ple's money, and it is not to the interest of the road
to teach the criminal element how to rob the rail
road safes. ;
In all seriousness the publication of such an article
is clearly against public morals. The article is writ
ten in such a way as to tempt persons of criminal ten
dencies to^esort to burglary by teaching them how
easily a safe can be. blown open. It is an instruction
in crime pure and simple. It might serve as a lesson
in a text book in a school for thieves. It will almost
certainly set some criminal to thinking of safe-crack
ing and probably to planning such an exploit. -The
danger, of such crimes is therefore much greater than
it was before the instructive lesson was published.
There is pfSrburse.no way to^ punish a paper that
thus publicly incites criminals to further crime by ex
plaining to.thenr how to commit it with success.
Public sentiment, however, may be able to reach the
editors of journals which publish such things and
convince them that they cannot: expect popular sup
port if they continue such publications. It is not
within the, rightful scope of journalism to teach* men
how to crack a safe any more than to teach them
how to commit murder and escape without detection.
ylt seems at last to be settled that Miss Stone is to
be lekased' and is to come homeland itgoes with
out-saying: the lecture bureaus are ~ getting ready to

BRITISH AND BOERS.
OLYMPIC CLUB PRESENTS SILVER
COLUMN TO JOHN D. SPRECKELS
AN innovation was established at
the Olympic Club yesterday after
noon. Through the efforts of the
board of directors and President
William Greer Harrison a secular
and sacred concert was arranged for the
club members and their lady friends, and
the occasion was taken advantage of to
present to John D. Spreckels a very hand-
Some testimonial of the club's apprecia
tion of a boon which has come from hi*
hands during the last seven years.
The programme, which was entirely mil- j
sical, was under the direction of Wallace j
A. Sabin. In the big gymnasium, dÂ«*co- j
rated with buntings, greens and bunches j
of Christmas berries, the audience gath
ered and listened to the carols of the
choristers of St. Luke's, the splendid |
singing of Donald de V. Graham and Mrs.
M. E. Blanchard,' three solos on the piano
by Miss Huilahand the eloquence of Gen- j
eral Barnes. . On the stage were the offi- j
cers of the club and their, wives, Ciaus
Spreckels, W. G. Irwin. W. D. K. Gttwon,
Joseph Grant, Henry E. Hlghton, Judge
Hebbard, Professor Hengstler and other
prominent guests.
William Greer Harrison In a neatly
turned speech , introduced General
Barnes, who delivered the presentation
address. Unfolding the national colors
from the stiver piece that stood on a ta
ble near the speaker, the gift was ex
posed to view. It is of silver and stands
four feet one inch in height and weighs
325 ounces. I In form it is a graceful Co
rinthian column with . a base of twelve
panels. On one of these panels are em
bossed the arms and emblem of the club,
the remainder portraying athletic exer
cises both ancient and modern. They are
all exquisitely elaborated, showing ath
letes in the quick and action on field and
water. The. base upon which these pan
els rest is marine in character. The work
throughout is â¢ all hand carved. On a
globe surmounting the column is a grace
ful figure of the modern type of athlete.
In his extended arm is a laurel wreath.
Accompanying this handsome piece of
silver is an album containing the auto
graphs, in alphabetical order, of the 1200
donors of the present. The album Is in
itself a work of art. It is bound in leath
er with filigree work of brass, after the
style of the fourteenth century, appliqued
upon it after special designs.
-The inscription on the silver column
reads:
Presented by the Olympic Club to John D.
Spreckels In recognition of his loyal and un
helflsh service In providing for the club Its
splendid salt water system. Christmas day,
1001.
General Barne3 in his presentation
speech told the reason of the gif c To Mr.
Spreckels the: Olympic Club owes its fine
supply of salt water. For seven years the
members of the Post-street athletic insti
tution â¢ have been furnished ', with ocean
water and no charge has ever been made.
The graceful silver column stands as a
testimony of the , Olympic Club's appre
ciation for the kindness and consideration'
of one of Its fellow members.
Presentation by Barnes. . .
The presentation speech of " General
Barnes is as 'follows: '
' Among the interesting events of this Christ
mas commemoration is the public expression
of the grateful esteem of the Olympic Club for
a gentleman whose generous bread has been
cast upon the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and
which, â  after seven years have glided by. he Is
about toÂ« find again in the memorial It Is my
agreeable duty Â«to offer him on behalf of the
members of the Olympic. Club.". â¢',-'-â¢, 'j

There are many gymnasia and athletic
schools in the United States, but it is uni
versally conceded that of all these Institutions
this is the most complete â the best and the
most comfortable place for work and play in
the whole country, and It Is most of all dis
tinguished by Its equipment of fresh and salt
water for bathing purposes and for the stead
fast culture of the sentiment of personal clean
llneps, which Is the prototype of the higher
civilization. No unclean race was ever a great
race, and he Who regards not his body as the
temple of his soul is not fit to possess the one
cr perpetuate the other.. Four hundred year3
ago Francis Bacon in his great work on the
advancement of learning declared that "clean
ness of body was ever esteemed to proceed from
a due reverence to God." Two hundred years
later the great Methodist preacher. John Wen
ley, admonishing his flock, then, I fear, quite
Inclined to physical self-neglect., if one may
judge by the context of hW discourse, upon
the subject of "dress," uttered the. memorable
epigram which deserves to be engraved in let
ters of gold upon the face of the wall of the
Olympic baths: "Care of the body ia cer
tainly a duty and not a sin;, cleanliness is in
deed next to godliness."
And so, founding the observation upon this
text, we may say that the Olympic Club. If
not a church, is very near one.- and William
Greer Harrison, if not a reverend, is all* the
same revered.
History of the Company.
This splendid structure, devoted to athletic
training is, as I say, especially endowed, and
if only Lord Verulam and the great Methodist
could again cross the boundaries of death and
visit here they might' heartily congratulate
each other -that the" seed th?y sowed had come
to a glorious harvest.
I believe it is now about ten years since
the Olympic Salt Water Company was organ
ized. The. idea of supplying the public with
cheap salt water bathing, easy of access, .was
born of â¢ the -active brain- of William dreer
Harrison. To the capital of the corporation
Messrs. John D. Spreckels and Adolph B.
Spreckels were the, principal subscribers, and
of Its shares they have always retained the
vast majority. This beneficent corporation ex
pended in the construction of its pumping plant'
and connections with the great bath house on
Larkin street more than -$500,000. This, es
tablishment has been an Infinite blessing to
the health of the public who frequent It and
an unmixed good to the neighborhood, whose
sewers Its exhausted waters perpetually flush
The Olympic Club at about the same time, for
certain legal reasons, organized an outside cor
poration and obtained from the Board of Su
pervisors a : salt-water franchise, % whlch It
proposed to transfer* to the Olympic Salt Water
Company in consideration of a perpetual supply
of salt water for bathing purposes. But, un
fortunately, it turned out, upon careful' in
vestigation, that the franchise so offered for
barter carried with It no power to the pur
chaser to collect tolls for any salt water which
might be sold. The agreement between the two
corporations was then clearly void for want
of consideration or, at' least, utterly ineffective
and without value, but that discovery made no
difference to John t>. Spreckels â hla word was
as good as his bond. He had promised the
water to the waiting swimmers of the Olympic
Club and he performed j his promise with re
ligious exactitude, not by way of sale, but by
gracious gift. For more thaa seven years his
, and his associates' pumping plant and pine
lines have the salty, glory of the Pa
cific Ocean and exhaled it* here, in infinite
freshness, with the saline scent of the seaweed
upon it, and in it the vigorous ozone of the
sea. More than 600.000.000 gallons of ocean
water have. In a constant tide that has known
no ebb, beÂ«n delivered into the great bathing
reservoir of your gymnasium to your vast gain
but at a personal loss to Mr. Spreckels and his
brother of more than $100,000. and this costly
benefaction Is assured to you for the future as
long as the salt water company shall exist or
until the bed of the ocean shall be pumped

Club should recognize on this day of universal
good win and kir.dly sentiment the great liber
ality and unselfishness of John D. Spreckels.
San Francisco has witnessed the descent of
numerous gigantic fortunes Into the out
stretched hands of many of Its citizens, but
there have been no other millionaires who with
quiet and unostentatious good will have done
so much for the health of the young men of
our city and made so little noise about it as
Mr. Spreckels.
With all my brart I congratulate the mem
bers of the Olyn.pic Club that It has found so
generous a friend, and I congratulate Mr.
Spreckels upon the pleasure which the beautiful
token presented to him to-day must always
bring.
It will adorn his home more than any
achievement of the painter's or sculptor's art,
and his children/ and his children's children,
as they look upon it. will be reminded of the
deep and grateful respect and affection with
which the members of the Olympic Club re
garded their father and grandfather.
John D. Spreckels Responds.
General Barnes' speech was punctuated
with hearty applause. At its conclusion
he extended, his hand to Mr. Spreckels,
who arose to thank the club for its ex
pression of good will, but General Barne3
had not yet finished. As a personal friend
of Mr. Spreckels he had yet a few words
to say. When the speaker sat down a
general handclapping followed. M^
Spreckcls responded as a fellow Olympiad
thanking the cJub members for their
handsome gifj and their kindly expres
sion. He said:
I heartily appreciate 'the glÂ« of the club anJ
the oratory of General Barnes. What I have
done would have been done by any other one
of you. I have always been fond of athletics
and what little I have done was from my own
desire and my best conviction to establish
something permanent for the Olympic Club. We
are all here as friends devoted to manly efforts
and clean aports. â¢ To nÂ»e this griff will repre
sent many a pleasant hour of good fellowship
which I have known in the Olympic Club.
Mr. Spreckels' response was warmly re
ceived. â¢
The musical programme continued after
the presentation and upon Its conclusion,
ladies, escorted by the club members,
were taken through the building. This
Christmas social innovation was voted a
general success.

morning, in an editorial discussing Stead'H

prophecy that the United States would

tion has been, on the whole, realized; but
It declares It to be utterly impossible that
Great Britain, as Mr. Stead extravagant
ly expresses it, should enter an Anglo-
American union except after a series of
disasters rendering separate existence im
possible. The paper considers any kind
of an Anglo-American federation equally
unlikely, owing to the Briton's Insatiable
love of caste. For the rest, It confesses
the enormous influence which the United

that a majority of Irishmen would vote
for federation with the United States.,.' -

Masked Highwaymen Oper

Church.
In the shadow of the First Baptist
Church (colored) two masked footpads
perpetrated a daring hold-up on Christ
mas eve. They waylaid and relieved Miss
Annie Martin, who resides at 518 Powell
street, of $38, all the cash that she had
in her purse, and a bank book containing
notes to the amount of 51000. The robbery
was immediately reported to Lieutenant
Birdsall, but the footpads had made their
escape and the police could find nothing
of them. - Â»
When the holdup occurred Miss Martin
was on her way home. The footpads,
both of whom wore masks that concealed
their features, sprang out from' their hid
ing place and confronted the frightened
lady with a pistol. From the deliberate
manner in which the robbers performed
their work the police are of the opinion
that they are professional -footpads. After
having relieved Miss Martin of all the
money which she had, the highwaymen
took to their heels and made good their
escape. At the time of the holdup there
were no people on Powell street to whom
Miss Martin could have appealed for as
sistance. â¢' - * â¢ :
Lieutenant Birdsall reported the hold
up toyCaptain Seymour yesterday and he
detailed two men to search for the foOt
pads. Notwithstanding the fact that the
robbers wore heavy masks, Miss Martin
was able to give a very good description
of them. A notice hag been sent to the
bank in which Miss Martin has her
money deposited instructing the man
agement not to honor the checks that the
robbers secured.

and with the first impressive notes the
members of the audience rose from their
seats and heartily and patriotically sang
with the orchestra. It was a spontaneous
outburst, and Mr. Schmitz, touched by
the situation, faced the audience and vig
orously brought voices and orchestra to
gether in rousing harmony. It 'was a
triumph in national chorus. The Mayor
elect telt so and the- audience realized it.
At the conclusion the applause was deaf
ening and the Mayor-elect cannot soon
forget the ovation.
Mr. Schmitz had promised to direct his
own new composition, "The American
Citizen March." He did so, and another
volley of applause awaited him upon his
taking his seat in the conductor's chair
and on the conclusion of the spirited
march. Indeed, so delighted was the
audience with the composition that its
repetition was demanded. The dramatic
part of the programme was given by pu
pils of the Caldwell College of Oratory
and Acting and the Robert Downing In
stitute of Dramatic Art. The play chosen
for the occasion was "The Tigress," in a
prologue and four acts. It was capably
acted and without exception the ladies

SCOTS PLAY AT "BOOLS."
Team of Oaklanders Defeats San
Franciscans on Park Green.
Sixteen members of the San Francisco
Scottish Bowling Club had a grimly
merry time for several hours yesterday
playing at the time-honored game of
bowling out on the green sward near the
baseball game ' in Golden Gate Park.
Eight of them were grouped under the
team name of "Oakland," because all
were residents of the town at the other
end of the ferry run. The other .eight
were the "San Franciscos." Two "rinks"
were played and Oakland won them both,
scoring a total of 43 points to San Fran
cisco's 27. San Francisco got " fifteen
points in the first "rink" ana twelve in
the second.
The green is not yet ln condition to suit
the members of the new club, for instead
of the perfect surface they -were used to
on the bowling greens ln the old country
the park lawn presents a succession of
corrugations and little hillocks that keep
the players guessing and interfere sadly
with the most skillful calculation of force
and direction and the amount of "green"
to give the bowl.
But if the sward was not the most sat
isfactory the accent was in the pink of
condition, and many a bowl that appa
rently meant to circle wide of the "jack"
after an erratic course over the green
was coaxed into point-winning position bv
the very richness of the braw Scotch that
the bowler or the leader used to coddle it
The old game is very different from the
one played with so much stage thunder
Jn the alleys. There are no* pins to be
bowled over and no alley to be followed
by the bowl. The green is 12C feet long,
and a white bowl, called the "jack," Ts
rolled across the sward by a team leader.
It must come to rest between the 80- foot
line and the end of the green. Then the
members of teams follow in turn, aiming
to hit the "jack" with their bowls or to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1901.
leave them near the "jack," as each bowl
a side has nearer the white one than any
of the opponent's bowls scores a point.
The bowls themselves are built on a plan
to make any one but a Scotchman think
that his Christmas has been too merry.
They are turned with circles on them,
and instead of being perfectly round
there is a bulging portion that makes the
bowl curve after it has rolled a certain
distance across the sward. The curve be
comes greater as the speed decreases, un
til the bowl is making circles somewhere
near the "jack" before it finally comes
to rest. ..
The Oakland team was composed of
Hugh Forgie, Dr. A. T. Crawford. An
struther Dalziel, James Hutchinson,
James Orchison, James P. Taylor, James
Moir and Robert Dalziel. The last named
scored ten points, the highest individual
score.
The San Francisco team consisted of
Joseph Gray, Wallace Cook, John Mc-
Laren, J. C. Moffat, John D. Robertson,
David Dalziel, Andrew Wllkie and An
drew McNair. . ,
Bowling was continued until late in the
afternoon. Among those playing after
the match game were Y. C. Lawson, John
Reid. Robert Park. J. C. Moffat, Andrew
McNair, Joseph Gray and Robert Dal
ziel.

ZOUR MILLION DOLLARS
A RAILROAD WILL SPEND
Cut-Off Line in the TTorthwest Coun-
try to Be Built Early Next
Year.,
TACOMA, Dec. 25.â The bringing of the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern rail
roads under one control will not prevent
early building by the former of the pro
posed cut-off between Ellensburg and
Llnd, in Central Washington. By this
new line, 110 miles long, the main line
will be shortened ninety-nine miles," be
sides giving a better grade than the pres
ent roundabout line, which runs south
ward to North Yakima and then turns
northward to Ellensburg.
Surveys for the cut-on* were finished
this summer, and surveyors have just
been eent out to finish the work of cross
sectioning it. The traffic of the Northern
Pacific has become so heavy In lumber,
shingles and wheat, that a large saving
can be made on the much shorter haul
which the cut-off will afford.
While the Oregon Railroad and Naviga
tion Company hauls Eastern Washington
wheat down the 1 Cohimbia River water
grade to Portland, the Northern Pacific
is handicapped by its present roundabout
line, together with the necessity of haur
ing grain over the mountains. This is
largely offset by securing its own coal at
Rosslyn at a cost of less than $1 per ton,
while coal costs the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company more than double
this price. The advantage will be largely
in the' Northern Pacific's favor after the 1
Lind . cut-off is built. Its cost will be
$4,000,000. Everything indicates that work
will commence early next; spring.

Nationals Capture Fastest
Game of the Winter
.Series. "
The Nationals and ;the All-Americas
each; won .a game of baseball yesterday
at Recreation Park. The morning game,
which was won by the Nationals by a
score of 3 to 2, was one of the fastest anl
cleverest gaines of the season. It was
witnessed by 200 spectators. In the after
noon 4000 admirers of the game saw the
All-Americas - win by a score of 5 to 2.
The playing did not approach that of the
morning in quality. ..â :â¢. /â & !
Waddell was in the box for the Alt-
Americas in the afternoon and only three
hits were secured off his delivery. He
struck out only two men, which Is away
below his average in previous games. It
is possible he is suffering from "writer's
cramp," as he has '.been, working overtime
recently signing contracts for next sea
son. â  >
"Sandow" Mertes was the hero of the
afternoon game. With two men out in
the third inning he sent the ball over
the center field fence for a home run.
The Nationals scored their second and
lust run In the fourth inning.
Lee, the first man up, was safe at first,
as Davis took: his foot off the -bag in
reaching for the ball. He went to sec
ond on a passed ball and made third on
a wild pitch. He scored on the throw-in
of Steinfeldt's fly out near the flagpole in
center field.
The All-Americas did their scoring in
two innings. In the first they scored one
run. . Umpire McDonald had three close
decisions to render, each r time calling the
runner safe. Beckley and his men stop
ped the game to object to the decisions,
which were not changed. Barrett, the
popular center fielder, was the man who
scored. Pickering, the first man ups hit
to the pitcher -and was safe at fir^t. Bar
rett also hit to pitcher. The ball was
fielded to Mertes at second to shut off
Pickering, but Sandow dropped it. Pick
ering then played too far otf the base and
was put out, Barrett making his way to
second station on the play. Mercer hit
â¢to Mertes and beat the ball to first, Bar
rett going to third. Lajoie hit to second,
forcing Mercer out and bringing Barrett
home. Davis flew out, retiring the side.
The All-Americas bunched tneir hits in
the sixth, sending four men home. Bar
rett led off with a single. Mercer secured
another. Lajoie followed with a clever
sacrifice, advancing his team mates. Da
vis sent the ball out to Carr in right field.
He misjudged the flight of the ball and
Davis was safe at third before it was re
turned to the field. Barrett and Mercer
scored. Irwin's two-bagger scored Davis
and Irwin came home from second on
Sullivan's single.
There were two j unusual plays during
the afternoon. In. the fourth Irwin tried
to reach home from third on a foul fly to
the catcher, but did not succeed.
In the second, with "McHale at the bat
and the bases clear, Waddell commenced
to deliver the ball, but overbalanced him

RIO SHANNON, A 15 TO 1 OUTSIDER,
TAKES THE CHRISTMAS HANDICAP
Jockey Lee Jackson Gives the Long Shot a Perfect Ride,
Beating Vesuvian Handily at the Finishâ Entries of
(3reen Morris Out of Luckâ Holiday Crowd Hit Books
RIO SHANNON, piloted by Lee
Jackson, and 15 to 1 in the bet
ting; furnished the sensational
feature : at Oakland yesterday by
capturing the rich Christmas
handicap. - Favorites divided honors with
long shots, , the' twenty-four books were
bombarded and battered out of all shape,
and what' more could an immense holiday
gathering wish for? When Sidney Bender,
the plunging talker,, told his friends in
New Orleans he found no sunshine in Cal
ifornia while here, he must have resided
in a basement and labored at night. More
perfect weather could not be found. Many
of the ladies were attired in summer silks,
and only those of, the male persuasion
whose systems had become^debilitated by
indulging in ferry-boat diet resorted to
topcoats. In the ring the crowd was so
dense that it was more difficult for a
stranger to place a bet than to pick up
a "sleeper" in a Kentucky faro' game.
Unfortunately for the layers of' odds,
though, the three long-shot winners, Sam
Green, Rio Shannon and Magi, were so
strongly played â¢ that nothing was laid
away. Even the field books retired from
action with severe casualties. As a rule
their position is considered as invulnera
ble as was the Boers' on Spion Kop.
The wonderment of the spectators was
the staying qualities exhibited by Rio
Shannon in the $3000 Christmas handicap,
at one and a quarter, for which nine faced
the webbing. Green Morris started three â
Watercure 128, Autolight 122 and Janice
with 105 pounds up. Against this trio of
smart ones 7 to 10 could be had. To an
uneven start the chances of Autolight,
Janice and Brutal were shattered. Icicle,
from P. Ryan's barn, ridden by Tommy
Burns and well respected in the ring,
cut quite a figure in the lead for a mile;
then the summer sun got in its work.
After Icicle had undergone the evapora
tion process Lee Jackson, astride Rio
Shannon, moved from second to first po
sition, and, while Vesuvian once looked
troublesome, "Jimmy" Coffey's buggy
horse paraded past the judges two lengths
in front in 2:06 flat. Johnny Woods,
with Watercure, unloaded his cargo in
third place, followed closely by Auto
light, well kicked and thumped by Win
nie O'Connor. But for his piece of ill
luck at the start the last named- horse
would undoubtedly have earned more
than the bones of the turkey .to pick
on. Greyfeld was also unfortunate,
Mounce getting cut off on the back
stretch while endeavoring to go through
on the rail. '
Jockey. Owen Mounce landed Parlzade
first in the opening two-year-old scramble
by a head from Royal Rogue, a 15 to 1
shot. The' St. Carlo filly outbroke her
field and led throughout. Flourish, with
Bullman up, took show honors. Snowber
ry was nearly put over the fence on the
far turn by Royal Rogue.
For a- time. during the progress of the
six and a half furlong run it looked as if
Gibraltar might get the purse. With Ed
die. Jones in the saddle he led to the
stretch, when he suddenly decided to sulk,
running unplaced. Never far out of it,
Wyoming, the favorite, worked 'his way
to the front and driving hard got the
verdict from Orleans by a head. King
Dellis had a stormy trip.
A surprise .was furnished in the hurdle
event, over a mile and three-eighths, for
which Phil Archibald and Rainier, coupled
as a stable, ruled pronounced favorites.
Phil Archibald, the mainstay of the en
try, piloted by "Stew" Peters, came to
grief at the second jump, his rider escap
ing Injury. Distance, a 20 to 1 shot and
a handy jumper, looked to have the race
won, when his rider eased up and was
led out more than a length by Sam Green,
a 15 to 1 shot, ridden by Evans. Lord
Chesterfield got away from the post poor
ly, never showing prominently.
Another member of the Jennings string
finished second in the San Leandro handi
cap, at six furlongs, for two-year-olds.
Sister Jeanie, astride which O'Connor sat,
went to the post a 3 to 2 choice, and in a
long drive had her colors lowered by
Magi, a 10 to 1 shot played to 7. Escalante
quit after showing first to the stretch.
Bullman on the 11 to 5 favorite Cougar
captured the final mire selling run. At
the close he was hard pressed by the two
year-old Bragg, ridden by Knapp, win
ning by a neck. only.
Track Notes.
Twenty-one books did business In the
ring, with three field books to accommo
date the more conservative players."
Up to yesterday George Rose was cred
ited with being $17,000 winner since he cut
in, only a short while back. He lost about
$2000 yesterday. . ' . â 
R. B. Milroy, who for years has been
connected with the association across the
bay, was well remembered by the horse
men. His Christmas box came in the
form of a magnificent case of silverware
and a very handsome dressing case, the
latter being presented to Mr. and Mrs. R.
B. Milroy.
Eddie Greaney was fortunate enough to
have a good bet down, straight and show,
on Rio Shannon.
GENERAL AXGEB SAFELY
PASSES CRITICAL PERIOD
DETROIT, Mich., Dec. 25.â Dr. C: G.
Jennings, who 13 attending General R.A.
Alger, said to-night: %
You may announce that General Alger has
safely passed the first and most critical stage
after the operation that was performed on him
last Sunday. Of course there will be a pos
sibility of dangerous developments for at least
another week, but we do not expect any.
The bulletin on the general's condition
issued to-night says: â¢ Â«
General Alger passed a very comfortable day.
The patient has had no fever; his pulse has
ranged from 68 to 82 throughout the day. He
will be given liquid nourishment by the stomach
for the first time to-night. I It will be a solu
tion of egg albumen. The drainage from the
gall bladder is perfect. C. G. JENNINGS.
Forr the first time since the operation
all the family were to-day admitted to
General Alger's room. The general was
very bright and cheerful throughout the
day, and was ambitious to do more and
see more people than his physicians would
permit. â

Croker's candidate and did not want to
be.

v "All I have to say is that the only in
terfering I did was for Belmont's own
good. If somebody had not interfered the
Grand Jury would have interfered."

ing papers to-day Belmont replied;
"Croker's statement that he had inter
fered for my good and that if he had not
interfered the Grand Jury would is of
such a character that it requires a posi

tained my nomination by the use of
money. On account-of that statement I

BERKELEY WINS
IN THE SOUTH
University Football Men
Too Fast for the
Angelenos.
Scores Six Touchdowns and
"Safety" to Opponent's
Nothing.
-LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25.â The Uni
versity of â¢' Calif orna football eleven
smashed and battered the heavy line of
the local All Southern California team
this afternoon for six touchdowns and a
safety, scoring in all 38 points, without al
lowing the Los Angeles players a single
chance at the goal line. The game was an
easy one for the college men and was
only saved from being a farce by the
fast work and clever team play of the
Berkeley eleven. Outweighing the .varsity
team by fifteen pounds to the man,
the All Southern Calif ornia team was
supposed to be in fit condition to hold
its opponents down to a lower score, but
the team did not succeed in making five
yards once during the game nor in pre
venting Berkeley from keeping the ball
for consecutive downs.
, Only a fair crowd was at Fiesta Park
to witness thq contest, which was played
under a clear sky ..and blazing sun. Ba
zata, for the All Southern Calif ornias,
kicked off to Womble, who .ran the ball
In for twenty-five yards. After' a series
of small gains by the college backs Over
all punted and Los Angeles returned after
attempting to make the distance. Berke
ley worked the ball to the locals' five
yard line, where Womble fumbled and
lost it. Bazata's punt was blocked and
the ball rolled over the line, scoring a
safety for the varsity team. The kick
out was received by Duden, who fumbled
and recovered instantly. Then by long
gains around the end by Womble and a
thirty-yard run by Mini with the assist
ance of a "backs-over" formation, Berke
ley scored the first touchdown. Overall
kicked the goal and the score stood 8 to
0. Two more touchdowns followed in
quick succession, the "University men dis
playing perfect team work and ability at
line smashing. All Southern California
was forced to call in substitutes twice
during the half to replace injured play
ers. At the end of the first twenty-five
minute half the score was 20 to 0 in favor
of Berkeley. *
Substituting Whipple for Duden at full
and Hendricks for Overall at guard,
Berkeley crossed the line three more times
in the second half. In the middle of the
half Mini was disabled and gave way to
Hudson, whose place at end was filled by
Williams. The local- team was clearly
outclassed and entirely unable to with
stand the fast play " of the varsity.' Ba
zata was outpointed 'by More and Over
all and lost ground every kick. â¢ With
splendid interference Albertson, Â«cored
the last touchdown, which defeated the
local team by a total of 38 points. Fol
lowing is the line-up of the two teams:

CHRISTMAS OBSERVED
IN DOMESTIC WAY
Alamedans as Usual Enjoy the Day
Amid All the Comforts of
." Their Homes. .
ALAMEDA, Dec. 25.â Christmas day,
as is the usual custom In this city, was
observed in a very quiet and homelike
â way. While the weather was ideal and
as warm as on many a summer day, Ala
medans did not move about much, but
contented themselves by staying in' their
own yards and enjoying all the comforts
of home. â â¢â â  ' , >
Several of the local churches, among
â¢which were St. Joseph's Catholic Church,
Christ Episcopal Church, First Methodist
Church and the German Lutheran
Church, held special services, all/ of them
being well attended. , /. .
The annual football game between' the
High School team and the alumni eleven
of that institution was postponed because
of the absence of a number of the play
ers. The game will probably occur on
New .Year's . day.

WITHNEY GAINS
TENNIS HONORS
Champion Defeats All
Comers in Singles
Tournament.
Smith Loses a Game by
Default* Through an
Error.
Champion George F. Whitney carried oft
premier honors in the Christmas class sin
gles tennis tournament which was decided
yesterday on the courts of the California
Club. He was easily the best player
among the forty who particpated in the
tournament. The handicaps favored the
championship class. The odds allowed by
the championship and first-class players
to the lower classes were practically the
same. -In the last tournament R. N.
Whitney, winner, of the championship
class, allowed Fred Brown, winner of the
first class, a handicap of "fifteen" and
won handily. Yesterday George Whitney
allowed the first class winner but "four
sixths of nfteen." He won easily from
Collier in the final.
The feature of the day was W. B. Col
lier's defeat of Grant Smith in the first
class. It was thought Smith, after the
excellent showing of last Sunday, â¢ would
win in his class easily, but he was decid
edly "off" in his game and proved easy
for Collier. The latter made few errors
and played a. remarkably steady â  game.
,The score in his favor was 6-1, 6-4.
In the second class Chet Smith carried
off the honors. He won both his matches
yesterday wthout the loss of a set. He
beat Frost 6-4, 7-5, and Homer Parker
6-1, 6-3. .
Herbert Schmidt won the third class on
Sunday. Fourth class honors went to
Leonard Wood, who played a long match
with Al Kenyon in the finals. The score
in Wood's favor was 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
The championship class match between
R. N. and G. F. Whitney was not played
out. It was agreed between the brothers
that George should play in the interclass
tournament.
In the play-off the draw resulted as fol
lows: L. E. Wood vs. Chet Smith, Col
lier a bye, G. F. Whitney vs. H.
Schmidt. Chet Smith defaulted through
a misunderstanding. The committee de
cided the matches should go over until
next Sunday and Smith left the grounds
with that understanding. Shortly after
it was decided to play the matches off
yesterday and Smith not being present
the game went by default. â¢â¢
The best handicapping was that in the
match between Collier and Wood. The
odds in Wood's favor were "thirty and
two-sixths," and proved right. Collier
won 6-0, 7-9, 7-5. Whitney allowed Schmidt
thirty and won without an effort, the
score beine 6-2. 6-0. j
In the final Whitney allowed Collier odds
of "four sixths of fifteen" and won in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-2, 7-5.

CULLOM'S BILL
EXCITES MIRTH
AND RIDICULE
Americans in London Rail at
the Proposal to Send a
Delegation to the
Coronation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 25.â A Central News dis
patch informs amused Americans here
that Mr. Cullom is introducing a bill in
the Senate providing for a Congressional
delegation of twelve to attend King Ed
ward's coronation as representatives of
the United States.
The absurdity of this proposition is
equaled by its snobbery. Such a delega
tion would be a source of unspeakable
embarrassment to the court.
The Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk,
cannot now find places for those subjects
of the King and the Embassadors who
have a right to appear at all the ceremo
nies. What would he do with a junket
ing party of twelve thrust so unexpect
edly on his hands? >

OAKLAND, Dec. 25.â The Monday Night

â¢ Patti Helps Out of a Dilemma.
Last winter Madame Patti was staying
for a few days in an isolated village at
the extreme end of Yorkshire. To kill the
monotony of the place the prima donna
went one night to a concert given in aid
of a certain village institution. Not half
of th<* performers turned up. Appreciat
ing the difficulty, Madame Pattiâincog
nita, of courseâ offered to oblige the audi
ence with a song or two. Then she sang,
in her own glorious way, three of her
sweetest. ballads. At the close the chair
man approached and in solemn tone
thanked her. "Well, miss." he said,
"you've done uncommon well. And al
though 'Arry Ock. the juggler, who thinks
nowt of takin' 'old of 'ot pokers and
a-swaliorin* needles, couldn't turn up, yet
you've pleased us very considerably,
miss."
Golf Unmakes a Minister.
A, Scotch "meenlster" took up golf. and.
despite great practice, could not succeed
in passing the tyro stage. His simple ex
clamations of "Tut, tut!" "Oh, dear,
now!" "Well, well!" and the like were
plain evidences of a perturbed spirit. One
day, when the perspiration flowed freely
from his brow and his honest contenance
shone with radiance, which was not due
to calmness of soul but rather to the heat
of the sun and his laborious efforts to
move the obstinate gutta percha from Its
station on the tee, he was tempted to in
dulge in strong language. "Dear, dear,
but I'll have to gie it up, I'll have to gie
it up!" he said at last, with a despairing
look at the ball. "Give up the game?"
exclaimed his friend, who had been a wit
ness of his attempts. "Na, na, the meen
istry," answered the other, with a sl^h.'

ADVERTISEMENTS.
IT IS IMPORTANT
To Know What You Are Taking
When Using Catarrh Medicine.
Catarrh is the short route to consump-
tion, and the importance of early and ju-
dicious treatment of catarrh, whether lo-
cated in the head, throat or bronchial
tubes, cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The list of catarrh cures is as long as
the moral law and the forms in which
they are administered numerous and con-
fusing, from sprays. Inhalers, washes,
ointments and salves to powders, liquids
and tablets.
The tablet form is undoubtedly the most
convenient and the most effective, but
with nearly all advertised catarrh reme-
dies it is almost entirely a matter of
guesswork as to what you are taking Into
your system, as the proprietors, whila
making all sorts of claims as to what
their medicines will do, always keep it a
close secret as to what they are.
The success and popularity of the new
catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, ia
largely because it not only cures catarrh
but because catarrh sufferers who use these
tablets know what they are taking into
their systems. Stuart's Catarrh Tablet3
are composed of Red Gum, Blood Root
and similar valuable and antiseptic Ingre-
dients, and are pleasant to the taste ami
being dissolved in the mouth they take
immediate effect upon the mucous lining
of the throat, nasal passages and wholo
respiratory tract. .'
The cures that. Stuart's 'Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished in old chronic case3 o*
catarrh are little short of remarkable, and
the advantage of. knowing what you are
putting into your stomach is of para-
mount importance when It is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using secret catarrh remedies.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval frqnt physicians, becaosa
their antiseptic character render thfcm
perfectly safe for the general public to Uso
and their composition makes them a com-
mon sense cure for all forms ot catarrhal
troubles.
All druggists sell them at 50 cts. for full
sized packages.

Masters of Vessels in Fort Join
in the Celebration of
the Holiday.
Christmas day was not celebrated in a
very ostentatious manner along the water
front. Many of the vessels in the harbor
had branches of evergreen at the mast
head and a few of them were decorated
with signal flags. The vessels noticeable
by reason of- their decorations were the
Sonoma and Lady Wentworth and the
transports Sheridan and Thomas.
Three hundred apprentices from the
English vessels in the harbor sat down to
a dinner given by the Seamen's Institute
at the hall on East street yesterday. They
spent several hours in disposing of all the
good cheer and edibles provided by the
institute, and returned to their various
ships grateful and pleased.
Boatman Harry Johnson rescued two
men from the waters of the bay early
yesterday morning. They are Joe Ander
son and Charles Christiansen, sailors.
They got .into an argument over their
swimming abilities, with the result that a
wager was made that Anderson could not
beat Christiansen swimming to Goat Isl
and. The men started on the race, but
the water was cold and becoming fright
ened they shouted for help. Johnson
heard their cries, put off in a boat and
pulled them out of the water twenty feet
from the end of Folsom-street pier, their
starting point.
The steamer Sonoma is scheduled to sail
for Sydney via Honolulu to-day at 10
a.m. She will leave on time if the colo
nial mails are not delayed.
The captain of the American ship Aryan
has not a very good memory, and to hia
forgetfulness is due the prevention of his
ship leaving port. The shipping laws pro
vide that all vessels shall be inspected at
least'- once a year. The Aryan's captain
forgot that more than a year had elapsed
since his ship had been inspected, and in
consequence when he trie'd to clear yes
terday he was notified that his ship could
not leave port until the local inspectors
had passed 1 upon her serviceability. As
the Aryan is loaded with grain for the
United Kingdom the captain's lack of
memory is likely to prove costly.
The America Maru Is the next vessel
due to arrive from the Orient. The Aus
tralia, from Tahiti, is due here any day.
The only deep water vessel to leave the
harbor yesterday was the big schooner
Helene. She sailed for Honolulu.
Andrew Sivertsan was treated at the
Harbor Hospital yesterday for burns in
flicted by carbolic acid. He claimed that
the fluid had been thrown into his face
by a jealous woman.

SUFFERS WHILE
VESSEL DRIFTS
Fireman John Henery of
the Gualala Scalded
by Steam.
Bursty Pipe the Cause of
Serious Accident on
a Schooner.
John Henery, a fireman on the steam
lumber Bchooner Gualala, swathed in
bandages, suffering untold agony anu
hoping and praying that death would
come and end his pain, was brought
ashore from the vessel named yesterday
at noon, shortly after it . had
been towed Into port by the steamer Na
tional City. Blistered from head to foot
It hardly seemed possible that he would
ever reach land, *ut reach it he did anil
he is now occupying a cot at the Marine
Hospital.
John Henery's experience on the voyage
of the Gualala which ended yesterday is
one that he will long remember If he sur
vives. An iron steam pipe burst in the
engine room of the vessel and for three
minutes the unfortunate iireman was un
der the steam. That he was able to es
cape with his life is due to the bravery of
Assistant Engineer Houston of the Gua
lala.
Overcome by the Steam.
The p*pe burst Tuesday night about 7
o'clock, when Henery was the only man
of the engineer's force on duty. The
Gualala was carrying a full head of steam
at Ihe time, and in a moment the engine
room, which is a small one, was filled with
the vapor. With the bursting of the pipe
came the darkness, for the lack of steam
caused the shutting down of the dynamo
which lighted the ship. Henery, blinded,
made a dash for the companlonway lead
ing, from the engine room to the upper
deck. He was confused, ran into a
Btanchion and was thrown to the floor.
Regaining his feet he tried again, but his
scalded, blistered frame was not equal
to the task and he^fell once more to the
floor, and this time he remained where he
fell. His shipmates, who had been awak
ened by the explosion and the hissing
sound of the escaping steam, were crowd
ed about the hatchway leading to the
room where the explosion occurred,
shouting and yelling directions to the un
fortunate fireman. They received only
groans in reply. ,
Houston to the Rescue.
Finally Houston dashed down the steps
which Henery had been seeking blindly
and holding on to the rail swept his
hands about him. They came in contact
with Henery's prostrate form and in a
moment the fireman was dragged Into the
air, but so blistered that he was scarce
recognisable. Then came a time of suffer
ing for the unfortunate man. The vessel,
bereft of power to stem the wind and cur
rent, drifted about helplessly. For hours
the craft was at the mercy of wind and
wave, and during all this time Henery,
despite all the efforts of his shipmates,
suffered intensely.
At 3 a. m. yesterday, when the Gualala
was fifteen miles south of Bowens Land
ing, the steamer National City was sight
ed, and a blue rocket summoned her to the
aid of the lumber schooner.
All possible speed was made by the
National City after she had taken the
schooner in tow and at noon yesterday
she reached port. Henery was taken to
the Harbor Hospital, where his blistered
body was dressed. He was then sent to
the Marine Hospital. He is terribly
burned and it is not expected that he will
recover. Henery i3 a single man and re
sides at 308 Folsom street.
Traded Salmon for Beer.
George McLaughlin was arrested yes
terday on a warrant charging him with
petty larceny. He is accused along with
others of stealing nine cases of salmon
from one of McNab & Smith's trucks on
Brannan street, near Zoe, Monday. Three
of the cases were recovered from a saloon
on Brannan street, where it is said Mc-
Laughlin exchange them for beer.

BOILERMAKER ENDS HIS DEBAUCH
BY SERIOUSLY WOUNDING TWO MEN
Earl G. Westmore, who claims to be a
boiler-maker at the Risdon Iron Works,
terminated his Christmas carousal last
right by shooting and seriously injuring
two Inoffensive men. Hans Halversen,
one of the wounded men, is shot through
the groin and has but a slight chance of
recovery. He Is night clerk in the Mont
gomery Hotel, 227 Second street, and ha
was shot by Westmore while tending to
his dutips. Charles Penne, Westmore's
second victim. i.Â« a barkeeper in Captain
Ubemeyt-rs saloon at 620 Alarket street.
He was shot through the left thigh while
walking along Tehama street on his way
home.
Both shootings were without the slight
est cause. Westmore entered the Mont
gomery Hotel shortly after 7 o'clock very
much under the influence of liquor and in
a very obstreperous mood. He went to
Halversen, at the night clerk's desk, and
. demanded the key to a side entrance of
the hotel, saying that he intended to
bring in a friend. Halversen. perceiving
that w estmore was intoxicated, refused
to give him the key, and Y^estmore start-

ed to go behind the desk to get it. Hal
versen shoved him out and Westmore
immediately drew a revolver from the in
side pocket of his overcoat and pointed it
at Halversen.
The clerk grappled with the drunken
man and attempted to get possession of
the revolver, but did not succeed. West
more fired and the bullet entered Halver
sen's groin. . The clerk did not immediate
ly fall, but continued to struggle with- his
assailant, who finally shook himself free
and walked out of the hotel. Halversen
collapsed on a couch, where he lay until
removed to the Central Emergency Hos
pital.
The clerk's wound is of such a serious
nature that the physicians at the hospital
feared to probe for the bullet. The shot
was fired* from a Colt's revolver of large
caliber. After the injured man was re
moved to the hospital Westmore was
brought to his bedside. Halversen identi
fied him as the man who fired the shot
John Earl, who is staying at the Mont
gomery Hotel, was in the office when the
shot was fired. He witnessed the entire
affair and declares that Westmore was
the aggressor.
Westmore went out with his revolver
In his hand, ready for action. He turned
into Tehama street and had proceeded
scarcely twenty feet when he met Charles
Penne, his second victim. He evidently
thought that Penne was going to inter
cept him, as he exclaimed: "I do not in
tend to be interfered with by any one "
He then raised his pistol and shot Penne
through the left thigh. Penne was also
removed to the Central Emergency Hos
pital. His wound, though not very seri
ous, was so painful that the doctors did
not probe for the bullet. When the shot
was fired Penne was only a few feet from
his own home.
Officers A. P. McQuade and P. T. Cas
sidy, whose beats are on Second street
and Officer G. P. Chase, from First street,
were attracted to the scene by the shots.
They found Westmore sitting in a door
way on Tehama street with his pistol in
his hand, cocked and prepared for the
first man who would attempt to take
him. Officer McQuado managed to rush
in on the Intoxicated man and overpower
him before he could make further use of
his weapon.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY; DECEMBER 26, 1901.
CAPABLE MEN
FOR JUDICIARY
Mention of Candidates
for the Supreme
Court.
Harbor Commissioner Herold
May Be Reappointed to
the Board. Â«-â¢;
It is not settled by any means \ that
Rudolph Herold will retire from the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners at the
expiration of his four years' term. It is
current gossip among politicians who are
close to Governor Gage that Mr. Herold
will hold office on the water front in San
Francisco until the Republican State Con
vention adjourns. It is even hinted that
events of the impending political contest
may suggest his reappointment. It is re
marked that the Governor has shown very
little inclination so far to displace Demo
crats from office. In certain Democratic
circles he is classed as a prime favorite.
The political situation is somewhat com
plicated by demonstrations from leaders
of the Union Labor party. The Los An
geles political workers in the Democratic
fold are planning to secure the ndmina
tion of Mayor Snyder by the Union Labor
party. Fusion is not recommended, but
the assertion is made that the Democratic
convention will indorse Snyder.*^ Demo
cratic success at the polls would not be
assured by the execution of this pro
gramme, for it is â¢ called to mind that
James G. Maguire had the Populist as
well as the Democratic nomination in 1898
and could not win. The Snyder men say:
"Gage carried Los Angejes by 1400 ma
jority; McKinley carried It by 2800, and
along came Snyder, who rolled up a ma
jority of 3400." The Snyderonians claim
that their man could win out over Gage
by four thousand votes in Los Angeles
County. R. H. Beamer, W. T. Jeter and
"Washington Dodge are rated as good run
ners, but the laboring men are said to be
unacquainted with these Democratic war
steeds.
If Gage is renominated by the Republi
can State Convention the Democrats will
take heart and put in the fleld the best
ticket that their party can produce. There
is talk of nominating Judge Peter J.
Shields of Sacramento and Judge D. K.
Trask of Los Angeles for Associate Jus
tices of the Supreme Court. This sugges
tion implies a purpose to select some well
known and able Democratic lawyer in
San Francisco for Chief Justice. The peo
ple of the State will rejoice if Republi
cans and Democrats, respectively, nom
inate the best men in the legal profession
for service on the Supreme Court. Judges
Shields and Trask, who were appointed to
the, Superior Court by Governor Budd,
were subsequently elected to the bench
by the people.
Among Republican lawyers mentioned
for the Supreme Court are Judge F. M.
Angellotti of Marin, Judge John F. Elli
son of Tehama, Judge Edward Sweeney
of Shasta, Judge A. J. Buckles of Solano
and Judge Lucien Shaw of Los Angeles.
C. H. Garoutte. Associate Justice of
Supreme Court, is a candidate for the
Chief Justiceshp, but there seems to be a
sentiment among Republicans in favor of
renominating the present Chief Justice,
W. H. Beatty.
Stories are in circulation to the effect
that ex-Governor Budd would not decline
the Democratic nomination for Governor,
but he assures his friends that his am
bition in this direction has been fully
gratified and that nothing would induce
him to serve the people again as chief ex
ecutive of the State. He is active, however,
in urging old line Democrats of known
strength to jump on the party band
wagon. The other day he advised Hon.
B. F. Langford to enter the field for
State Senator in San Joaquin County. The
venerable ex-Senator remarked that he
was out of politics to stay out.
The ex-Governor, who was recently ap
pointed by ex-Congressman Thomas J.
Geary and commissioned by Governor
Gage to visit Washington and assist in
the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
act, will leave the city for the national
capital within the next two weeks.
SORROWFUL CHRISTMAS
FOB, THE NTEBLOCKS
Their Nineteen-Day-Old Girl Baby
Suffocated Accidentally in
Her Crib.
Yesterday was a sorrowful Christmas
for George and Emma Nieblock, who re
side at 3318 Folsom street. Christmas eve,
so full of hope and pleasure to other3,
brought them only the keenest anguish,
for their little baby girl, only nineteen
days old, was suffocated in its crib.
On Tuesday evening, at 7:30 o'clock, the
mother nursed the baby asleep and
placed it in its little crib. A quarter of
an hour before midnight the father went
to the crib to kiss the baby good night,
but found that it had stopped breathing-.
Mr. Nieblock rushed out of the house and
brought in a doctor who lived near by, but
all the efforts of the physician to resus
citate the infant were in vain. The babe
had been suffocated by the blankets. The
case was reported to Coroner Leland, who
has ordered an inquest.

Aged Woman Dies Suddenly.
Mrs. A. B. Gibson, mother of Detective

SALVATION ARMY
FEEDS THE POOR
Many Hundred People
Enjoy a Christmas
Dinner.
Cheer Is Furnished at Hall
and in Homes to
, Deserving.
More than 2000 persons enjoyed the
bounty of the Salvation Army yesterday,
not alone in the basement of Odd Fel
lows' building, but in their homes, where
the* visits of the angel of plenty are few
and far between. It speaks well for the
present prosperity of the city that an
abundance of good cheer had been pro
vided. It speaks well for the labors of
the members of the Salvation Army that
such an elaborate spread was made.
Man's innermost wants were supplied al
most, to the point of repletion. Many a
hearty "God bless you" was uttered by
men to whom the day might have passed
without a ray of sunshine, or perhaps
hope. .
Early In the morning a long line of
men, with a few women and children in
terspersed, began to form on Stevenson
street at the rear entrance to the ban
quet hall. There were professional beg
gars, there were honest men that knew
the pangs of hunger and there were oth
ers representing all degrees of needy hu
manity. But all who came were welcome.
In the big banquet room there were six
tables â¢ set with accommodations for 450
persons at a time. They were decorated
with flowers and fruits and around these
tables the bonneted lassies passed and
attended to the wants of the guests of
the Salvation Army.
Shortly after 11 o'clock the flrst party
was let in. They found awaiting them
platters of turkey, roast beef, two kinds
of vegetables, fruit, pies and other comes
tibles that bo to form the menu of a
Christmas dinner. !
As soon as the guests were seated Col
onel George French, the provincial offi
cer, made a tfrief invocation and spoke
of the generosity of the people of San
Francisco. His remarks were brief, and
then the crowd at the tables, fell to with
a will. â  There was a hurrying and scur
rying, a clatter of knives, forks and
plates. Dishes were filled and refilled and
no one was allowed to leave the table un
til his wants were satisfied.
"Let every one have all that is want
ed," said Major Alfred Harris, who had
charge of the arrangements under the
direction of Colonel and Mrs. French, and
his hundred assistants responded. Then
the tables were cleared, others were ad
mitted, and this was continued until all
were satisfied. But when the 1500 people
at the hall were dismissed the labors of
the Salvation Army did not cease. There
were those who could not come. Provi
sion had been made to feet 1000 others at
their homes and the work of distribu
tion was continued. It was dark before
their labors were concluded.
Throughout the city the workers of the
army will meet to-night about their
Christmas trees in their various posts.
No special programme has been an
nounced, but the members of the army,
after their arduous labors of the Christ
mas day, will seek some slight relaxation.
DRINK TOAST TO HEALTH
OF THE GRAND MASTER
At the noon hour yesterday, New York
time, Knights Templar embraced In the
United States jurisdiction, which also in
cludes the isles of the sea, clinked their
glasses to the good health, long life and
prosperity of their most eminent grand
master, Henry Bates Stoddard. Here Is
the toast:
To Our Most Eminent Grand Master, Henr7
Bates Stoddard : Peace, health and plenty,
with a merry Christmas greeting from all his
Knights from Maine to Oregon and from, the
isles of the Fea.
In accordance with universal custom
the two commanderiea of Knights Tem
plar in this city, to the number of 350, me f
yesterday morning at 9 o'clock in the asy
lum of Golden Gate Commandery. at 6:25
Butter street. The guest3 of Golden Gate
Commandery were the members of Cali
fornia Commandery and a number of vis
iting Knights from different, parts of the
United States. Promptly at the appointed
hour the Invocation â was pronounced by
Sir Knight P. D. Code, prelate of Golden
Gate, and he was followed by the united
choirs of the two commanderles in the re
cital of the Lord's Prayer.
As the glasses were raised on high the
words of the toast were read, and John
F. Merrill read the response, as follows:
May the God of our fathers ever keep and
protect you rand may we meet In dally con
clave In the asylum above.
This sentiment was feelingly and ap
propriately voiced by Mr. Merrill in his
remarks that followed. The regular pro
gramme was then carried out. The toast
to the "Grand Commandery of Califor
nia" was responded to by B. P. Flint.
Judge Carroll Cook spoke of California
Commandery No. 1, of which he is tha
eminent commander. At the close he
called for a toast to Golden Gate Com
mandery, and a most eloquent response
was made by H. D. Loveland, the eminent
commander.
A telegram was received during the cer
emonies from Bay State Comamndery of
Brockton, Mass., presenting the toast
"Golden Gate." An appropriate response
was at once dispatched. Bay State and
Golden Gate commanderies have fre
quently exchanged courtesies at various
conclaves. "Templar Masonry" proved an
eloquent theme for Eminent Sir Knight J.
C. Campbell, while Sir Knight S. M.
Shortridge rose to the occasion when he
spoke on "Glad Tidings." The benedic
tion was given by Sir Knight James G.
Gordon, prelate of California Command
ery. . -
Some beautiful music was rendered in
cidentally to the exercises by the choir, of
which Sam D. Mayer was in charge. Next
year the ceremonies will take place under
the direction of California Commandery.

ENGLISHMAN SAID TO BE THE DUKE
OF NEWCASTLE VISITS THE CLIFF
That the Duke of Newcastle left San
Francisco last Friday on the Owl train
for the south there is no question, but
the question now arises whether or not
the English nobleman left the train when
out of sight of his San Francisco friend*
and returned to the city for purposes best
known to himself â after all, probably. In
the interests of his brother, Lord Hope,
regarding whose matrimonial affairs he
showed a decided disinterestedness. At
any rate an Englishman who passed as
the Duke attracted some attention yester
day at the vicinity of the Cliff House.
"With a party of friends this supposed
peer certainly visited there, and J. M.
Wilkins is authority for the statement
that he received the DuKe and a party of
gentlemen that he escorted him through
the Cliff House, and further that the
nobleman showed and expressed the
greatest interest in the visit and
thoroughly enjoyed the animated scene
about the beach.
Of one other thine Mr. "Wilkins Is posi
tive: that the Duke was taking in thÂ©
Christmas-summer zephyrs from the Pa
cific, and was heard to compare the ex
quisite, clear day with the possible chilly,
foggry, or muggy weather In his "dear
old London. It has been asserted that the
Duke's mission here was not for recrea
tion, but really to assist in procuring evi-

dence which might free the family from
an alliance which has rankled In their
noble hearts for some years.
That the Duke in view of the corona
tion of King Edward would scarcely leave
England for an extended tour is absolute
ly certain unless for matters of vast im
portance to the house of Newcastle. That
he has been in ardent opposition to di
vorce there is no doubt. A devout church
man and reverent, he does not believe In
putting asunder those who have been
united In the bonds of matrimony. But
there has been much influence brought to
bear on the Duke, which may have
brought about radical changes in his opin
ions.

WILLIAM EOCKEBILL '
KICKS HIS SIOK WTFjE
Water Front Saloon-Keeper, After
Being Beleased Prom Jail, Bru

William Dockerill, -who was arrested
Tuesday night on complaint of his -wife
for disturbing the peace, celebrated his
release from prison yesterday morning by
returning to his saloon at 12 Stauart
street and kicking Mrs. Dockerlll In the
stomach. The heavy kick caused an In

Dockerill became frightened when he
saw the result of his bruta^.y. He hob

one leg, and told Steward Kahn what he
