LONDON, Nov. 24.â This morning's
dispatches from South Africa
show that the recent fighting near
Viliiersdorp. southwest of Stand
erton, concerning which Lord
Kitchener report f-d nothing beyond the
fact that Commandant Buys had been
captured after attacking a patrol of 100
railroad pioneers, was really a serious af
fair. It seems that Grobelar's com
mando succeeded in surrounding and cap
turing a force of in British Cape Railway
pioneers. Subsequently Colonel Rimeng
ton came up with reinforcements, and,
after heavy fighting, compelled the Boers
to retire and to release their prisoners.
The British losses included Major Fisher,

day in the Grand Ampitheater of the
University of Sorbonne, which was filled

With reference to the story that the
British placed Boer women and childron
in front during the fighting at Graspan
June 6, when General Dewet's convoy
was capturedâ a story which has been
Fpread broadcast as an example of Brit
ish barbarityâ the Daily Mail sent a
dispatch of inquiry to Lord Kitchener,
who replied as follows:
"The story is absolutely untrue and de
void of all foundation. One child was
killed and one woman and child were
wounded by the Boers."

American Troops Attack a
Filipino Stronghold and In
flict Very Heavy Losses
MANILA, Nov. 24.â Captain Kdvard P.
Lawton's company of the Nineteenth Inr
fantry has attacked and captured an in
surgent fort on Bohol Island, south of
Cebu, in the Vysayan group.
This fort was surrounded on all sides by
a precipice, and the only entrance to the
higher ground was guarded by a stockade
with a line of entrenchments behind it.
Captain Lawton sent Sergeant McMahon
and twenty men to climb the precipice
and attack the fort in the rear. Sergeant
McMahon's party accomplished their task
after three hours' climbing through the
thick undergrowth. They took the enemy
by surprise and drove them from the fort.
As the insurgents escaped they had to
pass the remainder of Captain Lawton's
company at a distance of 150 yards. Here
the enemy suffered terrible losses.
The insurgents defended themselves
with both cannon and rifles. The cannon
were captured; the smaller ones were re
moved, while the larger ones were buried.
Captain Lawton, in his report, makes spe
cial mention of the bravery of Sergeants

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1901.
As the story has been prominent In the
recent anti-Chamberlain campaign in Ger
many, the Daily Mail has telegraphed
Lord Kitchener's reply to all the leading
German papers.
William T. Stead, lecturing in London
yesterday, said that he thanked God that
Germany and Europe were bold enough
to call baby murder crime.
"Compared with England's conduct,"
he continued, "Herod's slaughter of the
innocents was saintlike. Great Britain
ought to be beaten in this unjust war.
In the American war we employed red
skins, just as we have loosened Kaffirs
against the Boers, and, thank God, we
were beaten."
TWO LYNCHINGS
IN THE SOUTH
Murderers Overtaken and Put
to Death, in One Case
Avengers Being Negroes
COLUMBIA, S. C. Nov. 24.â An un
known negro was lynched in Anderson
County to-day. Yesterday afternoon the
man went to the house -of Mrs. Perry
Craft and asked for something to eat.
When she turned the negro shot her
through the back, inflicting a fatal
wound. The man fled, but was pursued
by hundreds of men. There are no de
tails of the manner of his death.
SHREVEPORT, La., Nov. 24.â Negroes
to-day oa Herndon plantation, eight
miles south of Shreveport, lynched Frank
Thomas, one of their own race, because
he had shot and killed a negro boy over
a debt of 30 cents.
The Sheriff was proceeding toward
Shreveport with his prisoner when a mob
of 200 negroes and half a dozen white
men took possession of the murderer and
promptly strung him up to the limb of a
tree.
President Returns to Washington.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â President and

GOVERNMENT '
THREATENS TO
RETAKE CITY
Federals Would Turn the
Guns of the Pinzon
on Colon.
Foreigners Notified to Seek
Refuge on Board of the
"Warships.
Uncle Sam, However, Will Instruct
the Commander of the Machias
Not to Permit the Proposed
Bombardment.
COLON, No\ s . 24.â The Colombian gun
boat General Pinzon arrived in this har
bor at 9:30 o'clock this morning. After an
exchange of notes between the United
States gunboat Machias and the General
Pinzon General Alico, commanding the
Pinzon, which has 600 men on board, offi
cially notified the American, British and
French warships now in the harbor that
he intends to bombard Colon at noon to
morrow (Monday), thus giving twenty
four hours' notice.
The various Consuls are notifying their
respective fellow-citizens that refuge may
be had on board the warships.
To bombard the town of Colon it is ab
solutely necessary to fire across the rail
road tracks, and the railroad employes
will probably refuse to work.
Lieutenant Commander McCrae of the
Machias is the senior naval officer, and
he awaits instructions from Wash
ington regarding the threat to bombard.
Breastworks at Panama.
Breastworks are being erected in the
public thoroughfares of Panama. The
townsfolk in the vicinity of these are
hastily removing to safer places. All
persons known to be Liberals are ar
rested on sight. The Government has
declared its determination to contest
every i->oh of g->;Â«und if an entrance to the
city is effected. It is rumored that some
seventy men who were wounded at
Perequito were landed on the .island of
Taboga, facing Panama harbor, to avoid
threatening alarm in Panama. Taboga
is about eight miles from Panama.
The Government is very anxious that
marines should be landed from the
United States battleship lowa, but Cap
tain Perry, her commander, has not com
plied with this request.
Prisoners Axe Recovered.
The Boyaca returned to Panama a sec
ond time yesterday afternoon with Gen
eral Alban at Chorrera, routing the
enemy and recovering all the prisoners
previously reported taken with the ex
ception of two. Arnold number re
covered, according to the Government
version, is the Alcalde of Taboga,
The Liberal version of the incident is
that the Alcalde was afraid to fight, and
when captured offered Domingo Diaz, the
Liberal leader, $1000 if he would release
him, that the offer was accepted and that
the Alcalde was allowed to go after giv
ing his word of honor not to attempt to
escape. The Liberals also assert that
General Alban effected a landing at
Chorrera after the Liberals had with
drawn to join the Liberal forces march
ing to the Empire station.
It is asserted that \.he steamer Darien,
which the Liberals recently captured
from the Government, escaped the Bo
yaca under cover of night, but it is gen
erally believed that she went to Tumace
some time ago.
May Attack the Liberals.
The Government asscits that the Chor
rera troops are momentarily expected at
Panama, and that on their arrival prep
arations would be made to attack the Lib Â¦
eral advance guard, aad that these will
not cease until Colon has been recaptured.
Great hopes are entertained that the
news of the capture of Colon will induce
the authorities of Barranquilla to send
big reinforcements to land at Colon and
annihilate the enemy.
It is rumored that the Liberal gunboat
Alacante Padilla, with General Herrera
on board, left La Libertad, San Salvador,
November 21, bound for Panama.
The United States gunboat Concord,
Commander Harry Knox, arrived at Paa
ama yesterday.
Colon has become a red city, being in
Liberal hands. A large red flag bearing
the words "Patria y Libertad" is flying
at the cuartel.
No Bombardment, Says Uncle Sam.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â The bombard
ment of tfiie town of Colon and conse
quent interruption of Traffic across the
isthmus of Panama will not be permitted
by Commander McCrea. commanding the
gunboat Machias, stationed at that port.
Secretary of the Navy Long said lat-3
this evening that he had received no in
formation from either Commander Mc-
Crea or Captain Perry, commanding the
lowa at Panama, regarding to-day's de
velopments in the situation on the isth
mus. Both of these officers have been
given comprehensive instructions, so that
they are prepared to act in accordance
with precedent already established. As
surances were given by Secretary Hay to
Senor Herran, the Colombian Charge
d'Affaires, a few days ago that the
United States would not permit the bom
bardment of the city of Panama by thÂ»
rebel troops. Probably the administra
tion will oppose as vigorously an attack
by. the Government forces on Colon. Un
GREEK CABINET RESIGNS
BECAUSE OF THE RIOTS
Demonstrations Against the Proposed Trans
lation of Gospels Into Modern Greek
Continue and Is Followed by a Crisis
ATHENS, Nov. 24.â As a result of
the demonstrations against the
proposed translation of the gos
pels into modern Greek the
Cabinet has resigned. This ac
tion was taken in spite of King George's
efforts to induce the Cabinet and the
Premier to remain in office. M. Theotokls,
the Premier, considers the responsibility
of a judicial inquiry into the recent riots
should be left to another Cabinet in order
that the truth may be established beyond
suspicion.
There was a renewal of the rioting to
night, though not on a large scale, with
demonstrations against the retiring Cabi
net. The residences of the Ministers were
stoned.^ The crowds were finally dis
persed by cavalry.
Armed students continue to occupy the
university buildings.
After an audience with King George to
night, M. Zaimis, former Premier, com
pleted a Cabinet made up as follows:
Premier and Minister of Foreign Af
fairs â M. Zaimis.
Minister of the Interiorâ M. Trianda-
Fyllakos.
Minister of Marine â M. Topalis.
Minister of Public "Worshipâ M. Monfer

Collision on the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western
Causes Trainmen to Jump
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â The Buffalo and
Chicago limited train on the Delaware,
Lackawana and Western Railway, leaving
here at 1:40 p. m., and a local train from
Dover, N. J., to New York, were in col
lision this afternoon at Morris Plains, N.
J. The trains were on a stretch of single
track. Both engineers and firemen
jumped.
Engineer John Skillman of the limited
and his fireman, Charles Loper, were
badly hurt, while the conductor and en
gineer of the local were bruised.
James Tinton of Morristown, a passen
ger on the local, was pinned down by
seats and seriously hurt.
Both locomotives were badly damaged,
but the coaches of the limited stood the
shock well. The local appears to have
been late and neglected to take a siding.
der the treaty of New Granada the
United States is required to "prevent the
free transit from the one to the other
from being interrupted or embarrassed."
The bombardment of Colon would cer
tainly interrupt and embarrass transit,
and Commander McCrea will therefore
not permit such action. If he is in need
of reinforcements Captain Perry of the
lowa will send him a detachment of blue
jackets.
IMPROVISED GUNBOAT TAKEN.
Steamship Hyades Brings News of a
Funny Expedition.
The Panama Railroad's steamship
Hyades, which arrived Saturday night,
brings the news that everybody on the
isthmus was preparing for an attack.
The rebels were known to be close to the
town, and thinking they were poorly
armed the commandant at Panama
tr.ought he would overawe them. He ac
cordingly requisitioned a dredger and
fitted It out as a gunboat. All the spare
cannon on the isthmus was put aboard
it and an officer of the navy, with all the
mon he could muster, taken aboard.
"The mud digger gunboat started up the
Chagres River to dislodge the rebels
while we were in port," said an officer of
the Hyades yesterday. "They went a

appeared in force. They were armed

MANTTiA, Nov. 24. â ThÂ« local

The United States distilling-ship

NEW YORK, Nov. 24. -The full

ashore at Monraouth Beach
during last night's gale, is to
night resting on the sands ap
parently little the worse for her experi
ence, and her crew are being cared for

all told. All went well until late in the
evening, when the wind attained a ve
locity of forty-five knots and the tug wa3
unable to make headway.
Tug Lets Ship Go.
The two vessels began to work In shore.
Their danger was seen from the beach
and the life-savers prepared to aid them.
Seeing the struggle was hopeless and that
the only chance of saving the tug was to
let the ship go, the hawser was cut. The
ship drifted rapidly on shore and struck
well up and close in at a point favorable
for work upon her. The tug lost her rud
der about the time she was freed from the
ship and, driven by the gale, perfectly
helpless, she drifted down the coast and
brought up against the Iron pier at Long
Branch and began to pound against it.
The crashing was heard by a fisherman,
who roused some citizens. With a rope
they went to the pier to aid the seven
men on the tug. Each wave, as it re
ceded, carried the Haddon away from the
pier, and then as the next came rolling
shoreward the heavy tug would be car
ried on its crest and dashed against the
piling under the pier or against the steel
work.
Escape to the Pier.
After many efforts, a man on the tug
caught the rope which was thrown from
the pier. He hunt? on and as the tug was
carried away from the pier the man,
clinging to the rope, swung clear of her
and then was hauled up on the pier. Thus
all were saved.
Meanwhile the shij> had been looked
after by the life-savers. The rescued sail
ors were taken to Long Branch.
About 3 o"clock in the morning the iron
pier broke in two. The tug had continued
to pound against it and the piling and
superstructure were gradually weakened
by the blows. The tugr, too, was. battered
to pieces.
When the pier was carried away one
man, whose name is not known, waa
washed into the sea and drowned.
LOSS BY WIND AND RAIN.
Heavy Northeast Storm Strikes the*
Coast of New York.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24.â A heavy north
east gale has been raging along the coast
for the past twenty- four hours. T?o
storm set in at sunset last evening, blow
ing with great severity all night, accom
panied by heavy rain. In the upper and
lower bay the 3torm blew with great
fury and an unusually high tide washed
upon the Staten Island shores, doing con
siderable damage to docks, small boats
and other craft. The Staten Island Rap d
Transit Railroad track between Tomp
klnsville and Stapleton was obstructed by
wreckage from piledrHers, and a small
schooner was driven ashore. A heavy sea
raged in the upper bay. Two steamers
that arrived during the night remained
at anchor off the quarantine station until
noon, when the health officers succeeded
in boarding them. Those steamers wera
the French liner Panama from Bordeaux
and the fruit steamer Donald from Ja
maica. The only other arrival up to noon
was the Mallory line ateamer San Marcos
from Galveston.
The storm did considerable damage in
the city. Windows in the upper part ult
the city were blown in and a few room
taken off. The greatest damage was don*
along West street, front!ng the Norti
River, where cellars were flooded. Tho

SUBMARINE BOAT
IS SATISFACTORY
Naval Officers Enthusi
astic Over Work of
the Fulton.
Those on Board Did Not
Experience Slightest
Discomfort
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â the presence
of a big crowd which, despite the storm,
assembled to witness the emerging of the
submarine boat Fulton, that craft rose
from the bottom of the bay this morning
at 10:30 o'clock, with all well and greatly
surprised to find there was a storm rag
ing. The test of the Fulton's staying was
highly satisfactory, not only to the offi
cers of the company that built her and
the naval officers present, but those who
â¢went to the bottom in the boat. They
report there was not the slightest discom
fort to them during their more than fif
teen hours' \>t submersion below the sur
face. sBQB
Captain Cable of the Holland Company,
who was in command, said that the boat
could have ' remained down for three
months if there were food enough on
board. Although there was but six feet
of water over the top of the turret, those
on board felt nothing of the storm.
Through the night there was a light roll
ing motion to the craft, but this was
ascribed to the regular motion of the
Â¦water and not to the disturbance which
was rolling the waves high on the shore.
Immediately on coming to the surface,
the Fulton, under her own power, ran
alongside the dock and tied up. Rear
Admiral Lowe and Lieutenant Arthur
Mac Arthur refused to go into any discus
sion of the performance of the boat, ex
cept to say they would be satisfied to
stay down longer. They are, however,
known to be enthusiastic over the work
of the .Fulton thus far.
Members of the crew Â¦ say they expe
rienced no difficulty in breathing, and that
the air was all that could be desired and
much purer and better than in an ordi
nary closed room in which are several
persons. Ever*- piece of machinery worked
to perfection during the night. The men
ate two meals while under water and
most of them obtained three or four
hours' sleep.
Rear Admiral Lowe said later:
"When we went down I assisted Captain
Cable in making an Inspection of ths
ship. Then I retired, while the crew
played cards and read Every few hours
I was awakened and made inspections of
The conditions. Early this morning Can
tain Cable called my attention to the
pressure gauge, which indicates the
depth. It showed that we were lower in
the water than at high tide last night,
when we were submerged. There was
nothing to show us why It was. but a
little while later I noticed that the water,
as we saw it through _lie deadlights, was
very dirty, and I imagined that a storm
was blowing. There was no rock or rol!
of the vessel to indicate what was goir.g
on."
Continuing. Rear Admiral Lowe said
that the air in the boat was as clean and
as pure as in a house cr in the cabin of
a yacht.
"Not once," added the admiral, "did 1
notice any sign of ba/1 air. gas or other
impurity. Considering that we did not
draw on the tanks a* all I consider this
is wonderful. It upsets all theories of
physicians and scientists, who tell us that
what we did last night was impossible. I
was critical all night and nothing escaped
me." Â¦ -, Â¦â¢ -
The experts present unite In calling at
tention to the sea-going qualities of the
Fulton.â The submarine boat was not "af
fected by the sea or the high wind whi^h
prevailed. Other boats of twice its tor
nage rolled and tossed so that they had
to get under way and seek a sheltered
harbor. . . â¢
The longest time that any submarine
boat had been under water heretofore 'n
the United States was three hours. Lieu
tenant Harry Colwel! kept the Holland
submerged that long in the Potomac la^t
year. The Fulton had never been under
longer than twenty-five minutes, when
she made a two-mil i run submerged a
few weeks ago.

MANAGER GRAU of the grand
opera company was feeling in a
very much happier mood during
last evening's performance of
"Les Huguenots" than he was
on the previous night.
A big house had gathered last evening
and filled the theater, but what pleased
the manager most was a dainty perfumed
note that he had received from Mme.
Err.ma Eames, giving the welcome news
that she had quite recovered from her
slight cold and would positively sing this
evening in "Faust."
Society was not in evidence at the
Grand Opera-house last night, when
"Les Huguenots" was given at popular
prices. The theater was given over, how
ever, to lovers of music, many of whom
doubtless had economized for a week in
order to witness a performance by the
Grau combination.
The stage and palco boxes were empty,
but tne seats at $1. $2 and $3 were
almost entirely sold. For two hours hun
dreds of men and women waited patient
ly in front of the theater for the doors to
open so that they might secure admis
sion to the house for $1.
It is an extreme pleasure to watch the
audience on one of Grau's popular-priced
nights. There is no attempt at lavish
dress on the part of the women, though
ihe majority wear their best. The men
do not care to show up in evening clothes,
crush hats and white gloves. The audi
ence came to the theater last night to
hear "Les Huguenots." and they were
there for that purpose solely.
Audience EnjoyS Musical Feast.
The musical bill of fare presented by
the management was a musical feast, and
was thoroughly enjoyed by the big audi
ence. The cast was a superb one. and
included Gadski, Homer, Bauermeister,
Van Cauteren, Suzanne Adams. Dippei,
Muhlmann, Bars, Reiss, Viviani, Du
friche. Vanni. Journet and Scotti.
"Society" nights have not heard such
tremendous applause as was given the
singers last evening. There were times
when the orchestra was drowned out by
the plaudits in the midst of a scene, but
Conductor Plon and his men were not in
duced thereby to stop playing and repeat
a number. The audience gave all the
singers ovations at the end of the acts,
and Madame Gadski fairly beamed with
delight when called before the footlights.
There will surely be a brilliant house to
night, when Madame Eames is to sing
Marguerite in "Faust." Salignac is to
sing Faust and de Reszke is to sing
Mephistopheles, while Campanari is to be
heard again as Valentine.
"Die Walkure" is to be repeated to
morrow evening, with Gadski, Schumann-
Heink, Reuss-Belce, Van Dyck, Blass and
Bispham in the cast.
On Wednesday night the double bill of
"Don Pasquale" and "Pagliacci" should
fill the opera-house to the doors. Sem

ftiEALY CASE IS STILL
ATTRACTING ATTENTION

American Abstracted Papers
From Court Records.
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 24.â Much at
tention is being given to the case of W.
EL Mealy, an American miner, who had
made complaint to the American Em
bassador regarding alleged ill treatment
by officials and fudges in Northeastern
Mexico. A charge is made against Mealy
ih&.t he is in contempt of court for the
abstraction of papers in a litiga

Mealy was released on bail and has ap
pealed to the Federal Circuit Covirt in
this city. Mealy's charge that he was
confined in jail at Monterery with mur
derers and thieves is denied here.
United States Embassador Clayton has,
it is said, incurred the enmity of Meaiy

dor's refusing to tako alleged unproved
charges to President Diaz.
Mealy asserts that he is menaced with
being dispossessed or mining property
worth several million dollars.

TWO SENATORS
OPPOSE TREATY
Money and Harris Will
Not Support the New
Canal Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, .N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â 0n1y two
Senators are known to the President to
be hostile to the isthmian canal treaty
just signed by Secretary Hay and Lori
Pauncefote. These Senators are Money
of Mississippi and Harris of Kansas.
Though the British Government has ac
ceded to all of the demands made by the
Senate, it would not surprise officials
should Money and Harris be supported by
other Senators when the ratification of
the treaty Is under discussion.
The number of the recalcitrants will
not, however, be large. Reports have
been current that Senator Mason of Il
linois would vote against the treaty, but
he has given the authorities to under
stand that his vote will be in the affirma
tive column when the Senate acts.

Gadski and Associates
Arouse Hearty
Applause.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
THE HUGUENOTS," with a very
good cast, drew a large audience
last night at the Grand Opera
house. All the singers as an
nounced came up to time, and
the audience was lavish in its applause.
The opera always draws for one reason
and another, its large cast, of course, the
first consideration. Last night's cast
gained in Dippel as Raoul and lost in
Journet as Marcel over its first repre
sentation this season, with De Marehi
and De Reszke in the aforesaid roles. But
it was a good performance all round, M.
Flon conducting with some little spirit,
though not with the exquisite precision of
Seppilli.
Mme. Gadski was the Valentine and
sang and acted with all her customary
charm. The audience greeted her work
with the hearty applause it deserved,
and in best voice she responded to the
enthusiasm. Gadski has never disap
pointed us yet. She has always th;tt
warm, sweet voice of hers in exquisite
trim, and she sings in a wholusoms,
whole-hearted way that wins a regard
much deeper than any mere perfection of
vocalism alone could do. She is loved
both as woman and grtwt Dippel was a
distinct gain over De Marehi as Raoul,
though the litter has a voice that over
tops Dippel's both in quality and power.
De Marehi was new and nervous in the
part, but it will be a different story in a
year from now or sooner. Meantime Dip
pel is the most useful all round tenor the
company boasts, assigned sometimes
tasks too great for his capacities, but an
all round competent singer. His Raoul
is very satisfying, and, .in the first act
particularly, he did some admirable sing
ing, his voice showing to unusual advan
tage. He invests the part with a plausi
ble air it generally lacks, and helped
courageously to leaven the dreariness of
the third act whenever he got half a
chance.
Suzanne Adams, who substituted for
Sybil Sanderson, indisposed, in the part
of Marguerite di Valois. did just as well
as she did the first night, which is say
ing a good deal. Her voice is finely flex
ible, and the difficult coloratura work was
done with delicious ease in a voice that
apparently is as yet impervious to cli
mate. Louise Homer was again the Page
Urbain, and sang her one song with her
usual aplomb. Miss Bauermeisterâ what
would the company do without Miss
Bauermeister?â helped things harmoni
ous as one of the maids of honor, and
Mme. Van Cauteren was the other.
Scottl added to his innumerable dis
tinctions another eminently satisfying
rendering of the Comte de Nevers' role,
and Mr. Journet was spirited but uncer
tain as Marcel.
To-night "Faust" is announced, with
Eames. Campanari, Sallgnac and De
Reszke in the cast.
CHAMBERLAIN INCIDENT
IS DYING OUT IN GEHMANY
Count yon Bulow Is Expected to Taks
a Finn Stand Against the
Speech.
LONDON Nov. 25.â With the moderat
ing tone of ..the German press the acute
phase of the Chamberlain incident is re
garded as already passed. Whether the
agitation will be renewed or die out alto
gether will now depend upon the attitude
Count yon Bulow, the German Imperial
Chancellor, assumes in the Reichstag.
It has been reported that Count yon Bu
â¢low will take a firm stand against Cham
berlain's Edinburgh remarks, being noth
ing loth to use the agitation in Germany
as a lever to assist the naval programme
of Emperor William.
The discussion still simmers In the Brit
ish press.
The Daily Chronicle says to-day:
"It should be plain to thoughtful Amer
icans that' this agitation in Germany is an
expression of an animus not aimed ex
clusively at one branch of the Anglo-
Saxon race. It is probable that, if South
Africa were peaceful, the Philippines
would be the subject of German pen and
pencil fantasies."
The Daily Chronicle recalls the Dewey-
Diedrichs incident and quotes largely from
Sydney Brook's article in the Atlantic
Monthly as proving "the necessity for an
alliance between the Anglo-Saxon peo
ples."
REVIEWS WORK
OF DEPARTMENT
Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock Suggests
Many Changes.
Calls Attention to the Neces^
sity of Eeclaiming Arid
Lands.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â The annual
report of Secretary Hitchcock of the In
terior Department, made public to-day,
indorses the conclusions submitted by
Commissioner of Indian Affairs Jones re
garding the present Indian educational
system. The Secretary says:
The management of the Indian service In the
field and schools, while satisfactory under ex
isting: conditions, is not deemed to be the best
for the welfare of the jnaian9 and different
methods will hereafter be adopted. This policy
contemplates requiring the working by Indian
allÂ«ttees able to do so of a fair portion of
lands allotted them and the contributing by
their industry to their own support of all not
entirely disqualified by .ictjal disability, phy- j
steal or otherwise, the discontinuance of th^ |
issue of rations to those able to support them
selves and the extension to the latter of every
possible aid for their well-being and encourage
ment; the inauguration of Industrial training
in all schools which are now established, so
that such Indians of both sexes may be taught
the trades or industries adapted to their cir
cumstances.
The income of the various Indian
tribes from all sources aggregated $5,358,
80, a falling off of $260,952, mostly due to
the expiration of treaty obligations. The
curriculum of Indian schools, the Secre
tary says, should be restricted to the
common school course, and the further
extension of non-n.servation schools
should not be permitted. In the future
full leasing privileges will be confined to
those whose disability or inability actu
ally disqualifies them from working any
part of their allotments, and in a lesser
degree to those whose disability prevents
their working more than a small part ot
their allotments, all other allottees to be
required to work at least forty acres oC
their allotment.
The Dawes Commission to the five civil
ized tribes in the Indian Territory re
ports that the rolls of membership of ony
one nation, the Sem'noles, so far have
been approved, and th<=ir lands have no'
yet been entirely allotted. The time can
not be fixed with certainty when the en
rollment of 'ie four remaining tribes wll
â¢be finished. There is a vast amount of
labor yet to be performed by the commis
sion, and Secretary Hitchcock recorr
mends that the comnrrsion be increased
by four members.
Tavors Construction of Reservoirs.
The report says that ihe act of June '&,
1887, known as the timber ana stone act.
if not repealed or radically amended will
result ultimately in th; complete destruc
tion of the timber on the unappropriated
and unreserved public lands.
The time has arrived, according to the
Secretary, when r-eservoirs must be built !
and managed aj a part cf a national sys
tem of forest and water conservation.
They cannot be successful if maintained,
however, without a thorough system of
forest protection. The introduction of
practical forestry on the forest reserves
has now begun. The general policy, a3
announced in an outline memorandum to |
the Commissioner of ihe General Land
Office, is that additional forest reserves,
with boundaries drawn to liberate the
smallest amount of scrip, should be cre
ated during this winter.
The good will of the residents in or near |
the reserves should be gained, forest fires
guarded against and +he resources of the
reserves should be made available for the I
conservative use of the. people. Systemat- I
ie investigation designed to make them
accessible and useful should be under- ;
taken, and each forest reserve and part
thereof should be dealt with on its own i
merits.
The report highly Indorses the vrork j
and recommendations of Commissioner of '
Pensions Evans, and says that the veter- \
ans have no more sincere friend th*n
their Commissioner, "who has served aa
an enlisted man in che armies of the
United States, and he but maintains and ;
defends the honor of their patriotic ser- :
vice when refusing to ignore both the let
ter and spirit of the law, he declines to )
permit the impostor, whether claimant or I
agent, to share in the bounty provided I
for the veteran and those dependent upon ;
him."
On the question of leclamation of the !
arid region the Secretary says:
Tbe investigations which have been carried on j
demonstrate that there is no one question now j
before the people of the United States of
greater importance than the conservation of
the water supply and the reclamation of the !
arid lands of the West and their settlement !
by men who will actually build homes and \
create communities.
Central Pacific Railroad Debt.
It is recommended tliut construction at .
once be begun as follows: The San Car- I
los storage reservoir, in Arizona, reclaim
ing 100,000 acres or more of public land, at !
an estimated cost of Sl.040.000; reservoirs ;
in the Sierra Nevada?, in California, for
reclaiming desert land 3in Nevada, and
the diversion of St. Mary's River into the .
headwaters of Milk TtiVer, In Montana |
An appropriation of $2f(-,000 is asked to '.
carry on the hydrographic work of the j
geological survey.
The Secretary says the net earnings ot
the bond-aided and lard grant rallroacie
amount to over $13,000,000, and the increane I
in gross earnings to *?.7,000.000. The in- |
crease in expenses for Ihe year was over j
$24,000,000. The debt of the Central Pa- \
clflc road to the United States now stands â¢
at $58,812,715.
The Secretary submits the annual re
port received from the Maritime Canal j
Company of Nicaragua, which shows that \
since its organization 11,145 shares of it? !
capital stock have been subscribed for at
par, aggregating $1,145,000, and that the
total amount of cash received in the j
treasury as reported by the company is |
$1 174 603. The expenses of the company |
have been $1,172,771 in cash, 31,990 shares I
of full paid capital stock, $5,000,000 of fiist
mortgage bonds and its obligation for !
$1,885,000 of these first mortgage bonds. It i
also has issued ISO.OOO .shares of jts capital
stock at par value in payment of conces
sionary rights, etc. The liabilities of the
company consist of tho amount still due
under its concession r-f the $1,885,000 of
bonds mentioned and of cash liabilities
outstanding aggregating $200,000. Its as
sets comprise its unused capital stock,
the $1.155,100 first mortgage bonds and the |
2420 shares of capital stock received in I
liquidation of the claim against the Nica
raguan Can-al Construction Company, tne
concession, etc., and the plant, railways,
supplies and other property in Central
America.

NOT IN DANGER
OF HOSTILITIES
Argentine and Chile Will
Reach an Amicable
â¢ Settlement.
Demarcation of the Boundary
the Only Serious Dispute at
Present Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, X.
W., WASHINGTON*. Nov. 24.âInforma
tion received in Washington convinces the
authorities that an' amicable settlement
of what is known as the pathway dispute
between Chile and Argentine will be ef
fected. This is gertainly the view of Senor
Don Elionoro Infante, Charge d'Affaires
of Chile in this city.
"There is absolutely no foundation for
the report that there is danger of war
between Chile and Argentine," said
Senor Infante- this afternoon. "While It
is true that a question has recently arisen
in connection with the construction of al
leged military roads, the two Governments
have discussed the matter in the best
spirit. They have consistently endeavored
to effect a satisfactory settlement, and I
have no doubt that an agreement will be
reached, if it has not already been at
tained.
"Argentine is well disposed toward
Chile and has no more intention, I am
sure, of fomenting- trouble than has Chile.
The relations of the two states are grow
ing closer every day. The only serious
question Chile has had with Argentine
"was in connection with the demarcation
of the boundary line, and it is submitted
to the King of England for determination.
"The latest questionâ that of cutting
pathways for the use of surveyors in con
nection with the arbitration proceedings
had no importance. The pathways are
not military roads and are not designed
for military purposes. A3 I have stated,
they have been cut only to facilitate Lhe
work of the surveyors.
"I regret that an impression exists in
certain quarters that Chile is opposed to
arbitration, for it is false. Chile not only
believes in this method of settling dis
putes, but she has practiced it on many
occasions."

Slayers of James

Trro Notorious Thugs Confess the
Crime, but Each Claims the
Other Fired the Fatal
Shot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Or., Nov. 24.â Startling de
velopments in the Morrow murder case
resulted in the arrest early this morning
of "Jack" Wade, alias "Kid" McFadden.
and William H. Dalton as principals.
Haunted by the knowledge that he was
implicated in the shedding of human
blood and unable by word or action to
hide the fact of his guilt, Dalton con
fessed his connection with the crime and
threw the blame for its execution upon
Wade- "Wade after being arrested and
subjected to a rigid sweat box examina
tion by the police also made a confession,
in which he declared that Dalton com
mitted the murder. The arrests were
made by Detectives Day and Weiner.
When the fact became known that the
murderers were arresttd a great crowd
gathered- around the City Jail. Guards of
police were stationed there to restrain
the surging mob. Tnreats of lynching
were frequent. The 11 on- workers of the
east side, in which trade young Morrow
forked, started to organize to hang the
f-wo men. The arrested men were spirited
&*ray to the County Jail, where they arc
kept safely against the angry crowd. No
outbreak occurred, law and order ele
ments prevailing.
Dalton's Version of the Crime.
Dalton will turn State's evidence. He
tolls the following story of the crime:
"Wade and I came dÂ»wn from Seattle.
We had been in several hold-ups there.
On Wednesday he told me where we coul i
pick up a piece of money. He said he
knew a gambler that we could lay for
and relieve of a nice wad. That night we
wandered over to the East Side, where
the man was supposed to go on his way
home. A little after *2 o'clock we saw
the boy, James Morrow, coming down the
street.
'â¢ You stay here,' said Wade. I stopped,
and he walKed toward the boy.
# "I heard the shot fired, and saw him
come walking back with the pistol in his
hand. I thought he was going to shoot
me.
" "The ought to have held up his
hands,' ace said. c 't
"Then we hid the pistol and came back
to the city. On Friday Wade threatened
to leave me and get out of town. I did
not like this, and thought I would tell all
1 Knew."
Wade Blames His Confederate.
The story Wade tells is similar. He
charges Dalton with having planned the
â¢ ~ "nold-up, and says:
? "Dalton had the pistol. When he saw
: morrow approaching he walked up to
him and told him to throw up his hands.
lilorrow had both hands in his pocket,
und when he drew them, out his money
ciinksd so that Dalton grew alarmed and
believed that Morrow was drawing a pis
tcl. Daltcn fired and shot Morrow througn
the left eye."
The clew that led to the arrest was
given by a lodging-house keeper, Mrs. W.
'Â£. Whitlock, where the men roomed.
They engaged their rooms on Wednesday,
and that night, after the murder, Mrs.
(Jock, wno had remained up until the
return of her lodgers, saw them come in
intoxicated, wet and muddy.
v The next day she heard of the murder,
The suspicion formed in her mind that
her lodgers were connected with the
crime. Yesterday she found that the two
men had robbed her of $60. This fact, in
connection with her previous suspicions,
led her to consult an attorney, who ad
vised her to see District Attorney Cham
berlain. She faced the men on Saturday
night and told them that she had in
formed the police. Dalton weakened and
confessed to her that her suspicions were
correct.
"Keep still, Mrs. Whitiock," he said,
"and we will share the $500 reward."
Has a Long' Criminal Record.
When Detective Day and District At
torney Chamberlain arrived Dalton re
peated his confession and told where
Wade was to be found. He was captured
at 4 o'clock this morning in a Third-street
rooming house.
Wade is regarded as the principal in
A the affair. He is a Pennsylvania man
\ and served a term in the Montana peni
tentiary. He has a record as a thuir.
Dalton will be allowed to turn State's
evidence, and the effort will be made to
fix the crime upon Wade.
The boy who was murdered on Thurs
day morning when on his way home from
a visit to his fiancee was buried to-day.
IRISH PATRIOT DYING

r-ompanions, was banished to Van Die

In 1869 the whaling ship Catalpa was fit
ted out to rescue O'Reilly and his com-
T'anions. Before its arrival O'Reilly es

BOXER MASSACRE
Captain Chou and Thir
teen Others Are Put
to Death.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 24.â Mail advices from
the Orient contain an account written by
a native for the Shanghai Daily News of
the recent execution in Hangchow of Cap
tain Chou and thirteen others who partic
ipated in the Boxer massacre in Chuchou
in September of last year. Captain Chou
commanded Chuchou garrison on that oc
casion and was the highest military offi
cial executed in reparation of Boxer out
rages.
Chou was executed at daybreak. His
son and eldest grandson endeavored to see
him on that morning, but were re
fused. He was brought out on foot,
clothed in black. In appearance he was
short and stout, white haired and growing
bald, being 50 years old. Officials present
offered him wine, which he declined. Ac
cording to the rule for criminals of rank,
he knelt and worshiped toward the
north, to thank the Emperor for his will.
Even a decree of death issued by the Em
peror is to be received with thanksgiving.
Chou was then thrust into an old sedan
chair and carried to the execution ground
ontside the Tsingpo gate. Here three
bamboo sheds had been erected, the cen
tral one containing the imperial decree of
decapitation. Chou sighed deeply on pass
ing this tablet, and, on seating himself on
the ground, said to the executioner:
"Finish it up well."
With two strokes of a sword his head
was severed from his body. The provin*
cial Judge passed by as the execution
took place, that he might personally re
port it to the throne.
Chou's son gave $6 to have his father's
head sewed upon the body and the corpse
was then placed in a coffin by the family.
Thirteen common prisoners were put to
death several days later, with little cere
mony. Their relatives were permitted to
take leave of them. Three of them told
their families to live better lives in the
future and avoid criminal acts.
One executioner beheaded the entire
thirteen within six minutes. He was
clothed with only a towel wrapped about
his loins and a cloth over his head. He
grasped the sword in both hands, striking
downward with all his might.
The beheading of these men has strick
en terror to the Boxer leaders about
Hangchou, teaching them that they must
not again stir up trouble. The effect has
also been to greatly enhance the influence
of the missionaries and consuls.

Trial of James Brown, the
Alleged Lyncher,
Opens To-Day.
ALTURAS Nov. 24.â Once more Alturas
is at fever heat over the trial of James
Brown, who was acting Constable on the
night of the Lookout lynching, and was
one of the guards who had charge of
Calvin Hall, his two sons and Daniel
Yantis. The trial will begin to-morrow
morning. One hundred talesmen have
been summoned and eighty witnesses sub
penaed. Brown will be prosecuted by
District Attorney Bonner, Attorney Post
and Attorney Sturtevant, the latter two
representing the State, while the defense
will be represented by Spencer & Raker
and Judge Harris. The attorneys have
all arrived, and jurors and witnesses are
coming in by dozens. An exciting trial is
looked for.
James Brown's wife and little girl are
here, and will be present during the trial.
It is a conjecture whether or not a jury
can be obtained from the venire of 100,
and in all probability another venire will
have to be issued by the court.
Since the town of Alturas has been in
corporated it is against law and order to
carry concealed weapons, and those en
tering the courtroom may be searched
for firearms. No trouble is expected, and,
while the town is crowded, everything Is
quiet.

Forcible Measures Taken to Break

ers of America..
MADISONVILLE, Ky., Nov. 24.â The fa
mous camp of the striking- miners, a quar
ter of a mile south of Nortonville, in the
southern part of this county, is a thing
of the past.
To-night there is nothing to mark the
rendezvous of those who defied the offi
cers, and even the courts, and gave the
State and county authorities so much
trouble during the past two months, save
ash heaps and the usual marks of debris
incident to camp life.
All of the campers on whom the sun rose
this morning, with the exception of a few
who escaped the officers, are prisoners
behind the bars of the County Jail,
charged by County Judge Hall with "a
breach of the peace, unlawfully assem
bling and banding together, thereby mak
ing the camp a menace and terror + o the
public peace."
The lour large tents, with all the camp
paraphernalia, were captured to-day and
brought in with the prisoners.
Responsible for Night Attacks.
Last Wednesday County Judge Hall is
sued an order commanding that the camp
be disbanded before Saturday morning at
daybreak, and that the campers not as
semble again in the county. Judge Hall
issued the order after receiving sworn
statements from more than 100 reliable
men, who declared that armed men going
forth from these camps were responsible
for the nightly attacks on the mines and
upon the homes of peaceable, law-abiding
citizens. He stated that the union camp
was an unlawful assembly of men banded
together for the purpose of destroying
property and intimidating men who per
sisted in working independent of the
United Mine Workers of America, "who
have had representatives in Hopkins
County for more than a year trying to
persuade and force the miners employed
in the mines to join their organization."
Judge Hall made* a careful investigation
before acting, and was then supported by
the Governor of the State and the entire
militan- force.
Campers Hurl Defiance.
After President "Wood of the United
Mine Workers and Judge Yost, chief coun
sel for the union, demonstrated their in
tention not to heed the orders of the court
and hurled defiance in the face of the offi
cers, Judge Kail called Adjutant General
Murray and the two companies of State
guards from Madison ville and Hopkins
ville. The plans for carrying out the or
der were completed last night and a spe
cial train left Madisonville for the scene
at 6:30 o'clock to-day, carrying Judge
Hall, Sheriff Hankins, two deputy Sher
iffs, General Murray, his aids, Captain
Ellis of Owensboro, Captain Gordon of
Frankfort and Captains Powers and
Strong, with the Madisonville and Hop
kinsville companies. The train took the
siding at Nortonville, and Judge Hall and
the Sheriff and his deputies drove to the
camp, a quarter of a mile distant. It was
found that all of the men save twenty
five or thirty had left, taking with them
the arms and ammunition. Judge Hall or
dered those present arrested and the four
large tents torn down and started to Nor
tonville.
Prisoners Decide to Walk.
"When the time came to remove the pris
oners to the train they refused to budge,
saying the officers would have to remove
them, which one of the deputies proceeded
to do. Stepping down he picked up one
of the men and shouldered him. The offi
cer was not very particular about the
way he carried the prisoner, and just as
he 'was in the act of throwing him into
the wagon, the man begged to be allowed
to walk. The others seeing that no fool
ishness was to be tolerated agreed to
walk also.
Arriving at the camp early this morning,
the first thing that attracted attention
was a piece of canvas about a yard square
on which was printed the following no
tice in lines to represent poetry:
"U. M. W. of A.â We have come to stay
with Hopkins County people until we get
a check weighman on the tipple to weigh
our coal and pay us in gold and eight
hours a day and payments every two
weeks, will be the order of the U. M. W.
of A."
Resistance Not Offered. -
When the officers arrived the camp was
in charge of Arlie Oates, first lieutenant
of the Greenville camp of Kentucky State
Guards, and the same man who was re
ported to have been killed in last Sun
day's battle at Providence. He was very
polite, and offered no resistance to the
officers. He and twenty other members
of the camp were taken into custody.
Oates and Jim Platt, one of the campers,
escaped at Nortonville and neither has
been captured.
One of the features of the capture was
the absence of negroes. Yesterday there
were more than a hundred negroes in
camp. The men who are held as prisoners
will be tried on the charge of unlawfully
assembling, causing a breach of the peace
and banding and confederating together
to violate the law.
Judge Evans of the Louisville district of
the Federal Court will hear the arguments
in the injunction cases to-morrow at Ow
ensboro.
Two attorneys for the coal operators in
the county have been gathering evidence
with a view of making the injunction is
sued several days ago by Judge Evans
permanent, and include all the mines in
the county as well as that in the Reinecke
district.
The injunction enjoined the strikers
from assembling within gunshot range of
the Reinecke mining property.
STRIKERS RETURN TO WORK. ;
â : â
Heavy Storm Raging on the Harlem \
River Retards Their Labors.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â There was a rush
of business at the Harlem River yards of
the New York, New Haven and Hartford
Railway to-day, for at 10 o'clock In the
morning all the men who went on strike
last Tuesday went back to work.
The work was somewhat interrupted by
the high tide in the Harlem River, this
being caused by the big easterly storm
which was raging. The tide covered the
approaches to the car floats so that the
work of shipping cars down the river
could not be done. The average rise of ,
the Harlem from low to high water is :
about five feet, but to-day the tide rose ;
about three feet above the average.
- At noon the tide receded somewhat and
four floats containing sixteen men each !
were landed at the yards. These floats
came from the depot in Jersey City and
were loaded with perishable freight.
The first train to leave the yards under
the direction of the old men left at 1
o'clock and the men lined up all along the
track cheering.
The headquarters of the strikers was !
deserted all day, giving evidence that the |
strike is over for good.

Eob St. Clair and Joseph Cardwell wera
lying with arms claspeu around each oth
er, cold in death. The bodies of O'Malley,
Maurice St. Clair and Price were discol
ored and bruised about the face, showing
signs of a struggle, it being very plain to
see that they made a desperate attempt
at retracing their step 3 to better air, but
they had advanced too far into the dead
ly white damp to escape alive.
It is said by members of the rescuinjr
party that Hurst, Bell and Oldham would
hardly have lost ther lives but for the
fact that they lost their way, entering a
chamber near one of the passages from
the Baby mine, m which the deadly white
damp had accumulated in great quantity.
The bodies were very much swollen ard
had been attacked by mine rats. They
were brought out at another entrance
than that at which they entered. They
were removed in wagons to Pocahontas,
where they will be prepared for burial.
The men met death on the West Virginia,
side, and Mine Inspector Paul of West
Virginia, who arrived on the scene to
day, gives it as his opinion that the men
were overcome by white damp.
Secretary-Treasurer Charles Thome of
Philadelphia, who war. here when the
men started into the mine last Friday, en
deavored to dissuade them from entering,
telling them he regarded the venture a
very perilous one.
The fire is still burning in the Baby
mine, and the mine officials seem at a
loss to understand how it will be finally
extinguished. Mine experts say there is
great danger of explosions by flooding the
mine.
Labor Crisis Approaching.
NANAIMO, B. C, Nov. 24.â The an
nouncement that Premier Dunsmuir is
anxious to engage Finn miners is likely
to precipitate a serious labor crisis on
Vancouver Island. Mr. Dunsmuir has al
ready refused to allow his employes to
amalgamate their organization with that
at Nanaimo. Last night the executives
of the miners' unions in the district met
and decided to call a meetine of all the
underground men, which will be held
here on December 7, and at which a de
cision regarding amagamation probably
will be reached.

FOLSOM, Nov. 24.â The remarkabl*
strike of $90 to the pan at the Gray and
Wing mine last Thursday was almost
doubled today. One hundred and thlrty
nve dollars was taken from one pan. The
streak is seven feet wide and literally
seamed with gold. Seemingly this
will prove to be the richest gravel de

California.
Mining activity In this vicinity is still
unabated and local companies are being
incorporated to prospect for the channel
near the outskirts of Folsom. Experta
assert that the channel runs through the
Natoma grant, which adjoins the town.
It 4s believed by experts that the Blue
Ravine mines, which have yielded about
J 1,000,000 in the last three years, do not
ouch the main channel, but are on the
east vein. Between these two mines
there is a high point of ped rock, and it
is believed that the main channel goes
through the Gray and Wing mines on the
west.
The discovery of the ancient channel
has given an impetus to mining industry
in this district. Ground is being bonded
by San Francisco mining companies and
operations will begin immediately.

FIGURES VERSUS FACTS.
THE uniform increase in the volume of business
which has prevailed throughout the country for
many months was broken last week by a falling
off of 9 per cent at Boston and one of 1.7 per cent at
Baltimore. These are small losses, and are note
worthy only because not one of the important cities
has shown any decrease for a long time. The total
clearances, too. were smaller, falling to a gain of 6.1
per cent over the corresponding week of 1900. while
the increase at most oi the large centers was consider
ably lighter than of late, that at^Ne.v York, for in
stance, amounting to only 7.4 per cent, against 50. 60,
and even as high as 100 per cent for some time back.
These figures would seem to indicate a decreasing
volume of business throughout the country, but the
commercial reports from the different sections show
no falling off in the movement of produce and mer
chandise, if a decline in provisions, accompanied with
slowly accumulating stocks, at Chicago be excepted.
There is the same complaint of the scarcity of cars
to handle the freight offered, the same flattering re
ports from the iron trade, the same mention of the
iarge re-order demand from jobbers almpst every
where, and a general report of a large demand for
holiday goods. In the iron trade, especially, the Call
for pig iron has caused another advance of 50 cents
and $r per ton at almost all markets, while the Chi
cago steel rail milis. which produce one-third of the
national output, are sold one year ahead. Locomo
tive works are also sold far in advance, while Central
Western mills will not p-omise deliveries of steel bars
under sixty days, and structural material is hard to
get. The New England boot and shoe factories are
so busy that the usual closedown between seasons
will be generally omitted this year. All this does not
look like any falling off in trade, as indicated by the
steadily decreasing bank clearings.
Most staples stand about the same as a week ago.
Hides are easing off somewhat and are quoted quieter
at a number of points, and several grocery staples
have declined during the past week. The tendency
in provisions, as mentioned above, is downward,
though the decline is slight and very slow. A large
increase in the American visible supply of wheat,
coupled with liberal supplies on passage to the Euro
pean consuming countries, has checked the advance
previously noted in this cereal, though wheat is being
fed to stock' in laVge quantities, not only in this coun
try but in Europe, owing to the light supplies of
corn and oats, both of which are in urgent demand
all over the West. The woolen and cotton industries
remain as before.
vYall street is running along without much excite
ment these days. The stock market is in strong
hands, and any decline is promptly checked by the
enormous corporate interests, which will not permit
the market to go down, even if brute financial
strength b required to hold it up. If values recede
to-day they recover to-morrow. The banks are watch
ing this business carefully and are wondering how
long the great moneyed interests of the country are
going to jemain on the long side of stocks. They are
getting conservative about their loans on the indus
trials, too. but have plenty of funds for good securi
ties, nevertheless, at rormal rates of interest. Ex
ports of gold from New York to Europe last week
attracted general attention, but nobody seemed to
know why the gold was going there â whether to re
store some scattering balances or to meet a Euro
pean demand for funds, or for investment. Various
causes were assigned, but even Wall street itself pro
fessed ignorance as to<he real definite cause. At any
rate, the shipments produced no effect of conse
quence, as the country has plenty of gold.
Our local situation remains without change, gen
eral activity and prosperity being reported through
out the city and State.
A. recent snowstorm covered the whole central re
gion of New York with ten inches of snow, and the
foolish people began to get ready for sleigh-riding
instead of taking the first train for California.
More and more it is becoming evident to Congress
men that the people arc satisfied with the condition of
industry ?nd trade and are opposed to any one-sided
reciprocity treaties or any tinkering with the tariff.
THE OIL RATE HEARING.
WHEN the Railroad Commission, after having
made a small reduction in oil rates, sud
denly set the decision aside and called for
a rehearing the public expected something funny to
happen. The expectation was increased by the state
ment of the Commissioners that the rehearing was
granted at the request of the railroad in order to
permit the oil men to make a better showing. As
it was the first time on record that the loser in a suit
ever asked for a new trial for the purpose of giving
the winner an opportunity to get a bigger verdict, it
was recognized that the commission had introduced
a novelty in its business and that the vaudeville stage
was no longer to have a monopoly of original stunts.
The rehearing is now under way, and enough has
been already brought forth to satisfy the expectations
of comedy. In the first place, to the surprise of the
commission, the oil men have really strengthened
their case by producing evidence from' Traffic Man
ager Bissell of the Santa Fe road to the effect that
while the Southern Pacific charges the general oil
traffic from $5 to $7 per car for hauling over the
Kern district switch, it charges the Santa Fe road
only $1 50 per car for the same service. Here is a
gross discrimination in rates and a proof that the
Southern Pacific makes a charge of as much as $7
for a service it can afford to render and does render
to certain parties for $1 50.
It was when the witnesses for the Southern Pacific
came to the front, however*- that the comic stunts
began. These witnesses one and all gave solemn
seeming and high sounding reasons in support of the
doctrine that cheap height rates would be injurious
to producers and to consumers. If that view be correct
then the world walks in darkness and the Southern
Pacific has the true light. From immemorial time it
has been believed that anything which cheapened
transportation was a public benefit. In that belief
men of all times and all nations have labored to im
prove their roads, to construct bridges and in every
way to facilitate traffic. It was for that they substi
tuted the locomotive for the stage coach and the
steamboat for the sailing vessel. Now it is argued
they were all wrong. High freights are a public
blessing. JÂ»
The witnesses who were brought in by Mr. Her
rin to sustain his new contention were from Los An
geles. They admitted that cheaper rates would admit
the Kern wells to compete with the Los Angeles
wells, and possibly that fact may have had something
to do with their opinion that high freight rates are
necessary for the welfare of Kern. One of the wit
nesses said: "In my opinion a low freight rate tends
to reduce the price of oil and brings no benefit s to
either the producer or the consumer." Another said
that if low rates were established "consumers would
hesitate to install an oil plant for fear the price of
oil would go down." A third witness declared the
oil men ought to form a combination to store and
control the output, that the present way of doing
business is a waste of $20 gold pieces. Lastly there
was a witness who declared that even if the railroad
and the producer were equitably compensated lower
freight rates and lower prices of oil to the con
sumer would not benefit the community.
It would appear from all that testimony that the
reason we have not developed manufacturing enter
prises in California is because fuel and freight rates
have been too cheap. Were we to make them still
cheaper nobody would install an oil plant. The dis
covery of oil is a menace to the industries of the
State, and the only way we can save ourselves is to
apply to the Southern Pacific Company to act the
philanthropist and fix freight rates so high that oil
cannot be furnished to the consumer for less than
present prices.
Had such statements been made by Bill Nye or
Mark Twain or Martin Dooley they would have been
greeted with roars of laughter. They turn all estab
lished principles of economics topsy-turvy and up
side down. They excite yearnings for an abolition
of railroads and a return to ox teams. They give
rise to a suspicion that the reason why the Southern
Pacific hauls oil for the Santa Fe at $1 50 per car
while charging oil men $7 is an expectation that the
cheap haul and cheap fuel will ruin the Santa Fe and
thus rid the Southern Pacific of competition. The
rehearing is to be resumed to-day. There is no tell
ing what doctrines will be sworn to before the day
is over.
It is to be noted that Commissioner Edson. who
made the motion and voted for the rehearing, is a
candidate for nomination for the office of Governor
of California.
From the frequency and the ardor with which the
British are now declaring their love for Americans
&nd their desire for an Anglo-Saxon alliance it would
not be surprising if some day they should send in an
application for admission as a State.
THE FIGHT FOR RECIPROCITY.
DISPATCHES from our special correspondent
at Washington are to the effect that the fail
ure of the foes of the protective system to
control the reciprocity convention at the capital has
had no other effect than that of increasing their ac
tivity. He reports that some of the large exporters
of manufactured goods have not given up the fight
and that efforts are being made to induce the Presi
dent and the Cabinet to believe that public senti
ment favors the reciprocity system.
It must not be supposed that the men who are
making this fight are sanguine of success at the com
ing session. In fact, our correspondent reports that
Mr. Kasscn, who negotiated the treaties now before
the Senate, admits that he has no hope of their adop- "
tion at this session and is even of the opinion that
the clauses of the Dingley tariff providing for re
ciprocity treaties may be done away with. Further
more, it is known that many of the most influential
leaders in both houses have declared their opposition
to the treaties and that these men are well assured of
the support of the Republican majority.
The real fight of the opponents of protection is to
make up in Congress this winter an issue on which
to appeal to the people at the next Congressional
elections. The whole course of the reciprocity agita
tion tends to that- ccnclusion. The New England
Free Trade League, which has transformed itself into
"The National Free Trade League," is warmly advo
cating reciprocity as a step toward breaking down
the protective system. With the free traders will be
joined the whole varied mass of so-called tariff re
formers. "Reciprocity" will be their battle-cry for
the present, and so far as they can do so by a vig
oroua campaign of education they will form a public
sentiment to support them when the elections take
place.
Despite the strength of the protective sentiment in
Congress and in the country at large, it is not to be
denied that the free traders have in the present situ
ation of political parties much to encourage them to
THE SAN FKA3SCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1901.
renew their fight. In the first place the Democratic
party has long been seeking a new issue and a new
leader. Free silver is an obsolete idea and Bryan has
lost his leadership. There are needed for the party
a new platform and a new candidate. A free trade
campaign under the mask of reciprocity offers them
an opportunity to attain both. It is therefore fairly
certain they will lend the party machine to aid the
fight, and the potency of that machine is well known.
Another important factor in the problem that will
count on the side of the promoters of the new move
ment is the giant manufacturing element which is
willing to sacrifice many American interests for the
sake of obtaining foreign markets for its own
products. That element is not strong enough to con
trol the manufacturing interests as a whole, but it is
strong enough to maintain a powerful lobby at Wash
ington and to contribute liberally to a reciprocity
agitation.
All signs, therefore, point to the conclusion that
the country is in danger of having its industries dis
turbed by another free trade agitation. It is a fairly
safe prediction that If any sort of success be accom
plished by them either in Congress this winter or in
the elections next fall the free traders will so develop
their agitation as to make a repeal of the protective
system the chief issue of the next Presidential elec
tion. There is no serious danger that such an appeal
will be sustained by the people, but the agitation
would fill the country with uncertainty and seriously
interfere with trade and industry. It is therefore de
sirable that the movement be decisively checked at
once. To accomplish that we must rely upon the
Republican majority in Congress. The protective
system must be maintained whether its enemy take
the name of free trade or of reciprocity.
The Panama Canal Company has not yet given up
the fight. It is said the company will appeal from
the Isthmian Canal Commission to Congress and
make an offer that will seem like putting the Panama
enterprise on the bargain counter. The suggestion
is interesting, but as Congress is not composed of
ladies a bargain counter proposition ought not to
stampede them.
FINANCIAL reports are to the effect that the
Japanese Government has for some time past
been trying in vain to place a loan of 50,000,000
yen in New York or in Europe. The negotiations
are said to have failed because both the American
and the European bankers believe that Japan ought
to pay 6 per cent interest, while the Japanese finan
ciers think their country should be able to borrow
money at rates not much, if any, in excess of what
are paid by European nations.
The statements concerning the desired loan are the
more interesting because of the recent publication
in this country and in Europe of the financial showing
made by Japan during the past five years. Accord
ing to the reports the revenue for the last fiscal year
was $138,748,000, while the expenses were $137,046,
00. The surplus was small, but it is to be borne in
mind that of late years very few European nations
have escaped a deficiency.
A notable feature of the report is the extraordinary
increase in both revenues and expenditures during the
last five years. In 1896 the revenues were about
$50,000,000 and the expenditures $43,000,000. Since
that time taxation has been augmented for the pur
pose of providing mainly for the army and the navy.
Large as the increase of taxation has been it has not
been sufficient for all the expenditures of the Gov
ernment, and the national debt has within ten years
increased from $135,000,000 to $260,000,000. The debt
does not seem large to Americans, among whom
there are private citizens who could probably pay it
off. but it is to be remembered that in Japan wages
are low and profits are small. The debt, which seems
slight to us, is a heavy burden to them.
When we turn from the finances of the Government
to the report of business enterprises a much brighter
situation appears. According to the figures given
there are now in Japan 873 industrial companies, with
an aggregate capital of almost $100,000,000; 2518 com
mercial companies, with a capital of almost $240,000,
00, and fifty-five railway companies, with an aggre
gate capital of $135,000,000. It is also stated that there
are 2356 banking companies, with an aggregate capi
tal of $250,000,000.
Another interesting set of figures are those re
lating to the export and import trade of the coun
try. From these we learn that of the exports of the
last fiscal year Japanese produce to the value of
50,000,000 yen was sent to Great Britain and Hong
kong, 52.560,000 yen to the United States, 31,870,000
yen to China, 19,150,000 yen to France, and 3,550,000
yen to German}-. Of the total imports 82,000.000 yen
came from Great Britain and Hongkong, and 2x,
500,000 from British India. 62.760,000 from America,
29,960.000 from China, 29,199,000 from Germany, and
8,095,000 from France.
With such a showing as that Japan ought certainly
to be no suppliant borrower of either the United
States or Europe for so small a sum as 50,000,000 yen,
which is approximately in our money about $25,000.
00. It would seem that she could borrow it for less
than 6 per cent at home.
Senator Plunkett, one of the Tammany leaders, in
an address to his constituents after the overthrow of
Tammany by Seth Low, said: "How are we going
to gfct through the next two years? Speaking for
myself I can say that no Tammany man in my dis
trict will suffer for coal. I've got lots of patronage
outside of politics. I've got 300 men on the street
railroads and I've got a pull with big corporations
that employ thousands of men, and they will take
care of Plunkett's followers until we get back into
office." The frankness of that statement is not more
interesting than the light it throws on the situation
in New York. When big corporations allow a poli
tician to name their employes it is not strange that
it takes something like a revolution to overthrow
the Tammany regime.
Because the Pennsylvania football team was de
feated by Harvard the Pennsylvanians were so much
aroused they held a mass-meeting and resolved to
raise $500,000 to provide their university with the
best gymnasium in America. Scholarship may come
or scholarship may go, but Pennsylvania is going to
keep even in athletics.
One of the results of the great railroad combina
tion between Hill and Morgan is an increased de
mand for the speedy construction of the isthmian
canal. It is admitted that the combination may be
have itself, but shippers prefer to have some kind of
competing line in case the unexpected happens.
The summer season statistics of Alpine climbing
in Switzerland this year show 119 fatal accidents, and
it is doubtful if the American football record will
make anything like such a strenuous showing.
JAPANESE FINANCES.
NEW YORK ZOO OWNS
DOUBLE-HEADED SNAKE
TWO-HEADED REPTILE RECENTLY ADDED TO THE NEW YORK
ZOOLOGICAL PARK. IT IS SAID THAT WHEN FOOD IS OFFERED
ONE HEAD FIGHTS THE OTHER.
A TWO-HEADED snake has recently been placed In the Zoological Park,
New York. The keeper says that when food is offered to the reptile one
head fights the other, and each tries to bite its rival. The writer has not
seen the snake fed, but the necks do not look long enough to allow the
heads to bite each other. Then, again, the snake is not poisonous; but,
of course, the snake does not know that. It does not seem as if the fight ought
to prevent either head getting anything. If either managed to swallow food it
would probably be just as nourishing as if both had done so, though, of course,
one throat might be left feeling hungry.
What will probably prove the snake's salvation is that he does not refuse to
drink. If one of the heads .had to pay for the drinks there might be trouble,
but as long as the Zoological Society sets them up the two heads drink together
as cheerfully as if they belonged to separate drunkards. And one can live for
a long time without food if only one has plenty to drink, as many an expert in
serpents can testify.
The snake recently had some trouble in shedding his skin. Ordinarily a snaka
wiggles his nose till he cracks the skin at the tip of it, and then crawls out
through the hole, but for this snake to do that is like a man trying to take oft
his trousers over his head. The snake accomplished the feat somehow, but no
body knows just how.

INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUMâ
A. R., City. Referendum may fee defined
in general as the referring of legislation
to the people for final rejection or ac

The initiative is the giving to the peo
ple the right of proposing legislation to
be acted upon.
According to the referendum as it is
now generally advocated no law, savfc a
strictly defined class of urgent measures
for the public peace, health and safety
which require a tw^-thirds or three
fourths majority to pass, would go into
effect without waiting; a fixed time say
ninety days. If during such time a part
of the voters, say 10 per cent, sign a. pe
tition for the referendum on that law v
would not go into effect until the next
regular election, when the people wou'd
vote upon it, and if a majority vote no it
could not be a law.
The initiative-If a certain percentage
of the voters, say 10 per cent, sign a dL
tition for a law and file it with the DroDer
authorities it must come before the Lee
islature, and perhaps be referred to the
people, whether they petition for it or no*
This is called compulsory referendum"
When the referendum is taken only when
a certain number of people petition for
it, it is called the optional referendum.
Together the referendum and the initia
tive furnish direct legislation.
BRITISH NAVAL
CONSTRUCTOR
TO BE RETIRED
THERE are persistent rumors of
the early ' retirement of William
H. White, director of naval con
struction in the British navy. The
reason Â¦ assigned is ' that '. of ill
health,'which, no doubt, is the result of
Â¦worry over the fiasco in the design of
the new royal yacht. Sir William is 56
years of age. and has had a phenomenally
distinguished career a3 - the foremost
warship designer â¢in . the world. , He en
tered the Devonport dockyard in "1859 as
an apprentice, and was appointed eight
years later on the admiralty staff under
Sir Edward Reed. In 1881 he was ad
vanced to chief constructor, and resigned
in 1883 to accept the position of naval
constructor to the Armstrong firm at
Elswick. Two years later the admiralty
invited him to accept the office' of di
rector of naval construction, .offering a
salary of $12,500 a year, and Sir William
returned to the admiralty." During this
service of sixteen years he has destjr-Ml
174 vessels, aggregating 861.000 tons, rep
resenting an expenditure of $250,000,000. be
sides a couple of hundred smaller ves
sels, such as destroyers ; and torpedo
boats. The unfortunate climax to such
a hitherto successful career in the build
ing of the royal yacht was the blunder
in calculations by a subordinate for
which Sir William has accepted the
blame, and the British navy loses an of
ficial which it will be difficult to find
an equally competent successor.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Another one of the frequent changes in
French naval policy has been announced.
The special committee appointed to ex
amine the naval estimates has refused to
allow the appropriation for building, more
heavy battleships. It also recommends
that all old sailing vessels and steamers,
whether armored or not. which are un
able to take their place in the .-fighting
line, should be either sold or destroyed.
The opposition to battleships is a de
batable question, but the recommenda
tion to remove vessels that have "become
obsolete from the navy list is in the lino
of economy and efficiency. < Most rof the
naval powers expend Vast amounts upon, .
vessels of doubtful utility, which money
could be expended with better results on
new construction.
Some amusing Incidents are reported
from Toulon, indicating how difficult* l^
is to obtain in practice the results aimev
at by a theoretically perfect organiza
tion. . ; v . - . Â» .
At L'Orient those in charge of the tor
pedo-boats forgot to embark their am
munition. The . mechanics taken on
board were unfamiliar with their work,
and several accidents were caused from
this. At Toulon torpedo-boat 62 was sent
to sea in a leaky condition, and its crew,
unaccustomed to the erratic behavior of
the boat,' became seasick. V
The French submarine boat Triton had
an experience while being tried off Cher
bourg last month which Its .crew will
never forget. When In about seven fath
oms of water a new plunging apparatus
was tried, which acted so prompty that
the boat struck bottom and sustained
considerable damage. Water began to
flow in. but the engineer, with rare pres
ence of mind, had the detachable weights
j cast adrift, and the boat rose to the sur
1 face, where the pumps were set to work,
and a tug towed the boat into Cher
bourg.
The Bousasque, a new French sea-go
ing torpedo-boat just completed at.Nor-
I mand's, yard, Havre, made an excellent
run October 26. She left Havre at 10:43
a. m. and arrived at Cherbourg at 1:15^
p. m., making the trip at an averager
: speed of 29 knots. The Bousasque is of]
.160 tons displacement and 4400 liorsepower,
147.7 feet length, 16.7 feet beam and" 8 feet
; draught.
Henri IV, a second-class battleship in
j course of construction for the French
navy, is still far from, completion, al
though the ship was intended to be ready
for sea in 1900. The delay is owing to
I non-delivery of machinery and guns. The
keel was laid at Cherbourg July 15. 1897.
and the launch took place August 23, 1599.
Her general design has been severely crit
icized by foreign experts, the general
I opinion being that the ship would be a
failure, and it is possible that a realiza
tion of this possibility may account for
the delay in completion. .
â¢*â¢ . - :
Navy building in Germany Is progress
! ing at a rate highly creditable to the of
'Â¦ ! ficials and r contractors. ;t; t With the launch
I of the Mecklenburg, November ;9,i there
are now 20 battleships afloat and 10 are
lon the stocks. The United States has 13
j battleships afloat, â¢ including- the Maine
and Ohio; which are not to be completed
within eighteen months, and 6 are build
ing. . It Is quite certain that, the 10 Ger
t man battleships will be completed within
j three years from date, arid al3o most
j likely, judging from past experiences,
; that; our ships will not be ready -withir*
: contract time, arid that, therefore, tbWy
; German' navy will have 30 . battleships*
1 ready for service by January. 1905. against
18 in our navy under .the most favorable
circumstances. The strength of a navy
exists in its actual available number of
battleships rather than in the number on
paper, and the United States navy is
therefore not entitled at the present time*
to take fourth place in the rank of naval
powers. BHVWIKp&IESfII Â¦'..â¢

Rev. F. X Baker Preaches an
Eloquent Sermon on
the Day.
A special Thanksgiving and harvest ser
vice was held last night at the First
Methodist Episcopal Church. Every seat
in the vast auditorium of the church was
filled. All the councils of the Junior Or
der of American Mechanics, Abraham
Lincoln Xo. 2, Starr King No. 8, U. S.
Grant No. 19 and Alexander Hamilton No.
35, were present and participated in the
exercises. The members of California
Council No. 1 and Martha Washington
No. 2, Daughters of Liberty, were also
present.
A most attractive programme of exer
cises was rendered. The opening num
bers consisted of an organ, prelude, a
hymn and invocation, followed by a re
sponsive reading of Psalm xxxiii. Mrs.
Turney led the choir in the anthem "Re
joice in the Lord." The trio from Haydn's
"Creation," "On Thee Each Living Soul
Awaits," was beautifully rendered "by
Mrs. Turney, Mr. Nevegold and Mr.
Crichton.
The chorus "O Lord, How Manifold"
preceded the sermon, which was delivered
by the pastor, Rev. Frank K. Baker. He
took as his theme the "Thanksgiving
Spirit." Rev. Mr. Baker said it was the
duty of all who were the recipients df
God's blessings to be thankful therefor
and to return thanks to him at this sea
son of the year when all are in the height
of the enjoyment of these blessings. Con
tinuing, he said:
Like the Israelites of old all should come to
God with a peace offering of thanksgiving
which would be delightful to God. and double
the offerer's blessins. As the Israelites came
to the altar with festive gladness in their
hearts, because peace was established between
God and themselves, so likewise should we
all unite in a sacrificial banquet of joy over
peace and plenty through our heavenly Fath
er'e good pleasure.
The remainder of the programme was as
follows:
Duo. Mrs. Turney, Mrs. Bolts; offertory, solo,
"With Verdure Clad" (from "Creation"), Mrs.
Robb. violin obligato. Mr. Crichton; anthem,
'While the Earth Remaineth," Mrs. Robb, Mr.
Nevegold and chorus; Glori Patri, people and
choir; benediction; organ postlude, march.
The following named sang in the choir:

DETECTIVE BELIEVES
DOLAN MURDERED MOLE
Gibson Is Satisfied That He Has in
Custody the Guilty-
Man.
Detective Tom Gibson, after a complete
investigation, is satisfied that John Dc lan
killed A. Mole, the longshoreman who
was stabbed to death on O'Farrell street
Friday morning. To-day Dolan will bn
formally charged with the murije;.
W. Chapman, who was with Dolan at
the time, will in all probability be booked
as an accessory. Gibson has the names
of several persons who witness* *1 the
fight that ended in the deatn cf Mole.
They all claim that Chapman held Do
lan's overcoat while he was fighting with
Mole and must have seen the Knife used.
When arrested Chapman's cuff was be
spattered with blood, which he claimed
was caused by raising the body of tue
oead man.
On account of the contradictory state
ments made by Chapman, Gibson is sat
isfied that he knows more about the mur
der than he has told.
Colored Shooter Charged.
Thomas T. Gibbs, the colored man who
shot George Tyler and James Wilson in
the Surprise saloon, 128 Pacific street.
Saturday night, was booked at the City
Prison yesterday on two charges of as
sault to murder. William Smith, another
colored man, who struck Gibbs with j.
cobblestone just prio*- to the shooting,
was booked on a charge of assault wit v !
a deadly weapon. Tyler's and Wilson's
wounds are not serious

DISMASTED BARKENTINE CHEHALIS
FINALLY MAKES PORT IN SAFETY
On Her Way Here With a Cargo of Coal She Is Caught in a Hur
ricane and Loses Her Fore and Main Topmastsâ Being Unable
to Make Progress Under the Light Winds She Is Behind Time
THE OVERDUE BARKENTINE CHEHALIS AS SHE WAS ENTERING PORT YESTERDAY SHE WAS PAR
TIALLY DISMASTED IN A HURRICANE OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA LAST AUGUST AND THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE THIRTY PER CENT REINSURANCE PAID ON HER.
THE overdue barkentine Chehalis
arrived in port yesterday, minus
her fore and main topmasts. She
was caught in a hurricane off
the Maitland Coast, where so
many a stout vessel has met disaster,
and had it not been lot skillful naviga
tion, the Chehalis would have met a
similar fate.
The barkentine is ninety-six days out
from Newcastle, Australia, and the un
derwriters were paying 30 per cent to re
insure their chances. The vessel was
long overdue, as at this time of the year
seventy-six days is aeemed a long pass
age. Then, again, she carried a class of
coal that is liable to spontaneous com
bustion, and that also gave cause for
fe:.r. A few days ago the insurance peo
ple got frightened and the vessel was
posted at 30 per cent. Those who gam
bled on her are now 30 cents on the dol
lar richer than they were Saturday.
In his report Captain Simonson says:
We sailed from Newcastle on August 20 last,
and had fine weather for five days. We were
still off the coast of Australia and in the course
of the reaviest storms that ever blow. A few
years ago the "Maitland" storm almost par
alyzed the world with the disasters it caused,
and I was oft! that 'coast. It was on August
Â£6 that a heavy gale from the north northeast
came up. It was accompanied by a very high
confused sea. Almost every wave broke aboard
and the shi:? was swept from stem to stern.
Green seas seemed to live aboard, and when
the storm was over our decks were covered
with a growth of sea grass. When the gala
was at its height there was a sudden change
of wind, and before anything could be done the
fore tonmast went by the board and carried
the main topmast with it. In spite of the
gale we managed to cut the wreckage adrift,
after salving the yards and nearly all the
rigging.
After that gale we never got a breeze to
speak of and had to come along like a duck
with a broken wing. We got here, however,
and that is the main thing.

A Gallant Rescue.
While out on the bay with his launch
Sybil Saturday, Henry Peterson made one
of the most gallant rescues in the his
tory of the water front.
One of the crew of the Albatross named
Peter Williams made an attempt to es
cape. He slipped overboard from the ves
sel and started to swim ashore. When
half way to Folsom street wharf
he found his strength giving out and be
gan to yell for help. Peterson was with
in ear call on his way home from a ship
in the stream. He at once steered for the
sound and made an attempt to rescue
Williams from the deck of the Sybil. He
failed. Williams then threw up his hands
and was going down, when "Pete" threw
off his coat and vest and jumped in after
him. It only took him a moment to reach
the drowning man and then he held him
up until the man in charge of the Sybil
could make a circuit and get back to their
assistance. They were soon aboard the
launch and in ten minutes were ashore.
Peterson forgot all about sending the de
POLICE FEEL CERTAIN
ERICKSON IS INNOCENT
Man Suspected of Looting Office at
Stone's Shipbuilding Yard Is
Released.
Edward Erickson, who was arrested
Saturday night on suspicion of knowing
something about the robbery at F. W.
Stone's shipyard at the foot of Baker
street, was released from custody last
evening, the police being satisfied of his
innocence.
Yesterday afternoon the envelope which
had contained the wages of A. Spatz, the
watchman at the yard, was found con
tiguous to the scene of the crime. It had
been torn open and the contents taken.
Detectives Coleman and Crockett, who
are working on the case, are satisfied
that the hole in the floor of the office
through which the thieves gained an en
trance was cut several days prior to the
robbery. Mr. Stone, the proprietor of the
yard, "feels sure that somebody in his
employ planned the crime.
Would-Be Robbers Captured.
Louis Nave and Frank Band wer-3
booked at the City Prison yesterday by
Policemen Bunner and Morton on a
charge of attempt to commit robbery.
They held up George Hansen of 239 East

serter back to the Albatross, but instead
gave him a hot drink and sent him on
his way rejoicing.

SHOCKING SUICIDE
OF AN ABLE LAWYER
Former Justice of the Colorado Su
preme Court Blows Himself Up
With Dynamite.
DENVER, Nov. 24.â News has just
reached this city of the suicide of Judge
M. A. Rogers, formerly of the Supreme
Court of Colorado and one of the ablest
lawyers in the State, at Steamboat
Springs, Colo., on Wednesday last. The
manner of the suicide was unusual. Judge
Rogers lay down on the ground with a
stick of dynamite under him and lighting
a cigar fired the fuse from it and calmly
smoked until the shock of the explosion
ended his life. The rash art was commit
ted among some willows near Bear River,
just inside the town limits. Judge Rogers
had beÂ°n at Steamboat Springs all sum
mer with his wife. No cause is known for
the suicide.
Park on Cuban Battlefield.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 24.â During
his recent visit here General Wood bought
for the Government the principal portion
of the San Juan battlefield, including San
Juan Hill, the site of the blockhouse and
Bloody Bend. The tract comprises 200
acres and cost $15,000. It will be consid
ered a United States reservation and the
Government intends to lay out a beautiful
park on the old battlefield.
"YON YONSON"
REACHES TOWN
His Dialect Amuses Au
dience at the Cali
fornia.
Orpheum Presents Some New
Performers of Highest
Quality.
"Ton Yonson," the Swedish dialect play,
is the attraction at the California Theater
this week. The house was packed to the
doors last evening, the opening night, and
judging from the applause the play seems
to be as popular as ever.
Every one knows the plot, how Yon
Yonson, a poor Swedish emigrant, make 3
untold wealth in Minnesota through an
invention. He marries the leading lady
in the play, who loved him in his poverty,
and lives happily ever afterwards. There
are a number of dramatic situations, one
of them formed by the cruel act of one
of the villains, who has an "awful jag
on." He throws Grace Jennings, the hero
ine, into the river, and then cuts the log
jam adrift. Yon Yonson appears at the
proper moment and thoughtfully saves
the young lady's life.
To those who like melodrama and good
dialect studies, the play will appeal. Knute
Erickson, in the title role, is very ciever,
and estaDlished himself quite a favoruo
last evening. Belle Gold as the booK
agent is a clever little soubrette, and
piays her part with dash and vim. During
the performance the quartet appeared and
sang several selections, whicn were weil
received. A medley of songs of to-day is
clever and original, and is of its kind one
of the best medleys ever sung in the city.
"Yon Yonson" will be on the boards for
the entire week.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Clever and humorous indeed is the
playlet in two scenes, entitled "The Co
caine Fiend," which is being presented
at the Orpheum this week by Andy L**wis
and company. Although rather amiss in
regard to plot, climax and such things,
it affords opportunity for the presenta
tion of a very humorously realistic char
acter sketch by Mr. Lewis as the fiend.
The latter's disposition to indulge his
florid imagination in the most exaggerat
ed and fantastical dreams of wealth
counted by the millions and his continual
relation of these dreams at all times, no
matter what the circumstances, causes
no end of merriment. Mr. Lewis' bear
ing and facial expressions in portraying
the manners of the fiend add much to
the effectiveness of the sketch. He is
very ably supported by William Melrose
and by Miss Maud Elliott, who acts the
part of a jealous wife in a most fascin
ating manner. Her popularity is already
established, and last night she was pre
sented with several beautiful bouquets.
Probably, in all the history of .the
Orpheum, there has never been presented
to the people a more delightfully viva
cious singer and dancer than La Belle
Tortajada. Strenuous, gushing life is
gracefully pictured in every move, and
her voice is charming in its sweetness.
In Mile. Taglione's fancy dances the
stage is transformed into a veritable
fairy's bower, with streams of gorgeous
ly colored lights.
Lillian Burkhart appears for her fifth
and last week in "Kitty Clive, actress."
The play runs a little too much into dia
logue, but this fault is almost entirely
overcome by the grace and skill of the
actors, and especially by Miss Burkhart's
winning manner.
The Kaufmann family, who are veri
table wizards of the bicycle, perform
their inimitable tricks in the most daring,
graceful and successful manner. Cole
man, with his trained dogs and cats, ef
fectually demonstrates to the Â¦ audience
that pussy and Towser can live in peace
and harmony together. The tricks dis
played by the pets are indeed exceedingly
interesting.

"Willie Collier opens the second and lasi:
week of his engagement at the Columbia
Theater to-night. Mr. Collier in the roie
of Robert Ridgway ir Augustus. Thomas'
new farce "On the Quiet" has a role that
suits him like the proverbial glove, and he
is supported excellently by his good com
pany. The attendance has been very sat

tion of grand opera, and the farce is one
that has pleased every one who has seen
it so far. A special matinee will be given

"We 'Uns of Tennessee" is one of the best

first given last year. There will be a spe

Enemy of the King" will follow.

Pollard's clever children will be seen at
the Tivoll this week ;r> "The Geisha," of
which they are said to give a surprising
ly good performance. Willie Pollard takes
Ferris Hartman's favorite part of Wun
Hi, the Chinaman; Harold Hill is the
Marquis Imari, Alice Pollard is the O
Mimosa San and tiny Madge Woodson is
the English girl, Mollie Seymour. The
costumes used in the opera were bought
in Japan, and the staging is to be elab
orate. A matinee on Thanksgiving day
will be given. "In Town," soon to be put
OB by the Australian juveniles, has never
been heard here before, but it is a great
favorite across the water.

"Siberia," a melodrama with six acts
for your money, is at trie Central Theater
this week. "Siberia" deals with life in
the mines, with the persecution of the
Jews and with all kinds of thrilling situ

thirty principals in the cast, and the
whole force of the Central stock company

SCOURING YOUR SCALP.
"Will Remove the Loose Dandruff
Scales, but It Won't Cure Dandruff.
If your hair is brittle and thinning you
have dandruff. The mere scouring of the
scalp of the loose scales wqp't cure dan-
druff; because dandruff is nothing but
scales of scalp being thrown up by a pes-
tiferous little germ In burrowing its way
to the root of the hair, where it saps the
vitality, causing falling hair and. in time,
baldness. Now you can't stop dandruff
nor falling hair, nor prevent baldness un-
less you destroy that germ; and the only
preparation that can do it is the new sci-
entific discovery. Newbro's Hefpiclde. In
fact, no other hair preparation claims to
kill the dandruff germâ all of them will
clean the scalp; soap and water will do
that, but only Newbro's Herpicide gets at
the root of the trouble and kills the dan-

king of trotters, arrived in Sacramento
this morning frc^m the East. With him
was his running: mate, the Tramp. George
H. Ketehurr). his owner, accompanied by
his wife and daughter, arrived on the
same train. Cresceus will trot against
his own world's mile record of 2:o2'*, at
Agricultural Park, on Thursday, under
the ausipces of the Sacramento Driving
Association.
Cresceup has been the sensation of the
year in trotting-horse circles. He will
have earned before the middle of next
menth. when he will be retired for the
season, nearly $100,000 in purse 6 and for
exhibition miles. Cresceup wrested thÂ»3
title of champion from The Abbot at
Brighton Beach soon after the start of
the grand circuit. Ed Geers. the driver
of The Abbot, claimed his horse was out
of condition, owing to an attack of dis
temper. The two great rivals met again
at Readville. with the same result, Cres
ceus winning decisively.
Cresceus made the new world's record of
2:023^ at Columbus, Ohio, on August 2.
The fractional times were: 29%. 595 i,
Crt-sceus will be sent for the mile record
at Sacramento on Thanksgiving: day. He
will also be shown in this city and in Los
Angeles. His owner received a flattering
offer from a theatrical manager in the
East to have the great horse shown on the
stage. He declined the offer, preferring
to have the champion star y.'ith the
track as a stage settingâ something he is
more familiar with.
-ceus will be shipped to Toledo, the
home of his owner, on December 12, the
at intention being to retire him per
manently from the track while he is still
in his i>rime.
GRANT 6SUTB. WINS
TENNIS SINGLES MATCH
Defeats George Armsby in the Final
on California Club Court for
Silver Trophy.
The handicap singles tennis tournament
commenced last Sunday on California
Club courts was finished yesterday, and
resulted in a victory for Grant Smith. The
perfect weather brought out many specta
tors, who were treated to some clever ten
nis.
George Armsby and John Gibson Jr.,
both of the third class, played the first
match of the day and met on even terms.
The match was exceedingly close and the
outcome was in doubt until the last point
had been played. Young Gibson started
off well and took the first set, (i â 4. In
the second set he had a good lead, but
Armsbys steadiness enabled him to take
this set by the close score of &â 7. In
the- last set Gibson ran the score up to
Zâl in his favor and looked to be a sure
v.inner, but Armsby. by playing a careful
game, won the set. 6â3.
In the other match of the semi-finals.
Grant Smith, the scratch man, was op
posed to Richard Erskine, who received
odds of â¢'thiru."
In the first set Smith seemed slow to
Ettrt. and Erskine won without an effort,
the score being 6âo6 â 0 in his favor. In the
second set Smith steadied and won han
dily. 6â3. The last set was close after the
first few games. -Smith ran the score up
to 4âl4 â 1 in his favor, but Erskine -braced at
this stage of the game and took the next
four games ir. short order. With the score
5â45 â 4 and 40 â 15 in his favor, Erskine looked
to be a sure winner, but Smith, by clever
Â¦work, pulled the set out. Bâ6.
In the final match Armsby received odds
thirty and one-sixth" and was a fa
vorite for first honors. Smith was in fine
form in this match, and by putting every
thing to his opponent's "backhand." which
Â¦was his vulnerable point, won in straight
sets. The score was 6â l. 6âl, 6â4.6 â 4.

Open Stake Honors Go

Courser.
Floodgate Beats Sacramento
Boy in the Union Park
Special Event
The two stakes carded for the regular
weekly attraction at Union Coursing
Park were run to a satisfactory conclu
sion yesterday and were prolific of good
! sport.
D. J. Healey's imported greyhound Fine
I Form took first honors in the open
I stake, beating the Aeneid kennels' im
: ported Fine Fire in tfee final after an un-
I decided course. The runner up had a
; hard course in the second round against
I Lost Chord, and was hardly expected to
come back in shape for another trial.
With Fannie Hugnie as his opponent,
. the English courser made his next trial,
I a short and easy one. and followed this
; performance by retiring Amedee without
allowing her to score a point. His next
victory was over Loyal Lad. Then in
the deciding course by his determined ef
fort to keep up his work Fine Fire ex
hibited stronger staying qualities than
the talent is wont to accredit him with
having, and in the run up led Fine Form.
Healey's dog evened up matters in the
, work and an "undecided" resulted. Fine
I Form in the run off showed the stronger
I dog and captured the flag by a score of
! 12 to 5.
Freda C. was beaten in the fourth
J round by the ultimate stake winner in
: a close course, and Royal Anne was re
ti ed by the same courser in the semi
final, after she had shown a winning gait
in the earlier rounds.
In the special event George Nethercott's
Floodgate finished in first place, with
Sacramento Boy runner .up. Charta was
' figured the most likely candidate for
stake honors. In the second round the
; wise ones quoted 4 to 1 that she could
; outpoint Master Clair, and played their
: opinion quite heavily., Carroll's dog was
: returned a winner by a score of 10 to 6.

WASPS WIN THEIR LAST GAME
OF THE SEASON ON HOME GROUNDS
Pitcher Iburg Proves an Enigma to the Heavy Batters of Oakland
Who Are Unable to do Anything With His Curves and
Shoots â Schmidt Pitches Two Games for the Cripples
THE San Franciscos and Oak
lands broke even on the day yes
terday, each winning on their
home grounds. This was the last
appearance of 'the pennant win
ners in this city in a league game this
season. They go south next week to play
Los Angeles, and will return for a series
of games with the all -star Eastern teams.
The Sacramento and Oakland nines wMI
play here commencing on Wednesday.
The regular league season ends with this
week.
In the game at Recreation Park yester
day afternoon the run-getting was aU
confined to the sixth inning, when ths
Wasps sent three men home. The Oak
lands could do nothing with Iburg'a
curves, getting only fuur scattered hits
Schmidt pitched both the morning and
the afternoon game for Oakland.
"Cousin Parke" Wilson was the finst
man up for the Wasps in the sixth. TL"
best he could do was to fly out. Hilde
brand singled, and reached second en an
overthrow to first. Schwartz bunted safe
along the left field foul line, sending
"Hilde" to third. Schwartz stole second.
Krug was out on a pop fly. Shay singled,
scoring Hildebrand and Schwartz. Reilly
followed with a two- bagger, on which
Shay scored. Graham was out at first,
retiring the side.
Catcher Hanson came in for the great
est applause of the Cay for upsetting a
clever play of the Wasps. They have
been working the double steal" witn
great success. This is done when there
is a man on first and one on third. The
man on first starts for second as the
pitcher delivers the ball. This invariably
induces the catcher to throw to second to
head him off. The n:rÂ».n on third starts
for home and .scores. ISasy!
The spectators wera nudging one an
other yesterday when the opportunity pre
sented itself for Uncle's clever young men
to do this trick. The first .part worked a.l
right, but Hanson upset al! calculations
by shooting the ball to third instead of to
second. He caught Schwartz napping, re Â¦
tiring the side.
Shay, Krug and Graham were the prin
cipals in a clever double play, the ball go
ing from shortstop to second base, thence
to first, as though shot out of a gun.
Hildebrand was pr^ented with a pai."
of bats upon his first appearance. He
used one and made a single with it. The
score:

Angels Win One Game.
i LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24.â Los Angeles J
and Sacramento played two games to
day, the former winning one and tying
the other. The morning game was all
Sacramento's way up to the eighth, when
the heavy batters of the Looloos fell on
Hoffer for five hits and a total of four
runs, tying the score. As there was an
other game ahead they stopped at nine in
nings.
The afternoon contest was pretty and
hotly contested until the fateful eighth,
when McNeely weakened just enough to
lose the game. Both teams played lively,
snappy ball. Score:

FOLD ROBBERY OF SALOON MAN.
Two young men early yesterday morn
ing vi3ited the saloon of Sears & Foley
at 201 East street and called for drinks.
Michael Scars was on watch at the time,
and as he started to serve the men one
of them struck him, knocking him down.
The other <.nen produced a handkerchief
saturated with chloroform, and placing it
over Sears' face held him until he be
came unconscious from the effects of the
drug. The desperate robbers then rifled
the cash register of about $200. Sears,
after recovering consciousness, notified
the police, but they failed to find any
trace of the robbers. Sears described the
man who applied the chloroform as being
rather short, stout built and wore a lignt
mustache. The other was about 22 years
of age, dark complexioned, and was well
dressed. Sears thinks he will be able to
identify them in case they are arrested.
Last night Detectives Egan and Freel
arrested a young man, who gave his
name as William Mclntyre, on suspicion
of being one of the robbers.
Sears will be asked to identfy him to
day.
Charged With Stealing Watch.
F. J. Dewey was arrested last night
in a saloon at 20 Mason street by Police
Officer W. W. Wilson on a charge of
grand larceny. R. O. .Twiss is the com
plaining witness. He alleges that Dewey
snatched a gold watch from his pocket
and passed it to a confederate.

EASTERN STARS COMING.
Best Players of the Big Leagues to
Appear Here.
Next Thursday the all-star Eastern
baseball teams will play their first game
in California. Sacramento will be the
scene of the contest.
The National League team will be made
up of the following men: Rube Waddell,
pitcher; Chance, catcher; Beckley, flrst
base; Mertes, second base; Steinfeld,
third base; Hulen, shortstop; Harvey, It ft
field; Van Haltren, center field; Carr,
right field.
In the All-American team, taken from
the American League: La Joie, second
base; Bradley, third base; Barrett, cen
ter field; Pickering, left field; Davis, first
base; Irwin, shortstop; Bernard or Mer
cer, pitcher; Sullivan, catcher; Carey,
right field.
The visiting teams will come to this
city on Friday en route to San Jcse, where
they play exhibition games on Saturday
and Sunday. The following Saturday a
nine made up of Eastern stars will play
the San Francisco nine in this city at
Recreation Park. All the visitors have
made big reputations on the ball field,
but chief interest centers about Pitcher
"Rube" Waddell and Seconu Baseman La
Joie. Here is what a veracious chron
icler has to say of the former:
George Edward ("Rube") Waddell of the
Pittsburg Club, who In 1899 made his mark as
a Ditcher in both the Western and National
leagues, was born at Bradford, McCane Coun
ty, Pa., on October 13, 1576. He made a good
record as an amateur in his youth at Har
mony, Butler County, Pa. About the middle of
August, 1897, he signed with the Louisville
Club. "Rube" did not strike his gait until
last season. He was farmed to the Columbus
Club of the Western League, which was trans
ferred to Grand Ranids. "Rube" batted .229,
fielded .986 and won thirty-six of the forty
eight games he pitched for Loftus' team. Ho
struck out eleven of the St. Paul players in
one game and equaled the performance against
Detroit. His record with the Louisville Club,
to which he reported after the close of the
Western League season, was Â«sven victories
and two defeats. In a game against Chicago
he fanned out thirteen of his opponents. He was
an enigma to the National League batsmen.
and is regarded as one of the best pitchers in
the business. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and
weighs 200 rounds.
The same writer has this to say of La
Joie:
Napoleon La Joie of the Philadelphia Club
is conceded to be the best second baseman of
the year and one of the finest batsmen in the
business. He was born at Woonsocket. R. I ,
twenty-seven years ago. In 189Â« he was a mem
ber of the Fall River Club of the New Eng
land League and in the eighty games in whicn
he played that year he batted .429. The Phil
adelphia Club purchased his release during the
summer of that season and La Jole's batting
average for thirty-nine games in the National
League was .328. He led the National League
first basemen that year, with a fleldlrur per
centage of .992 in thirty-nine games. He has
played the outfield well, but is at bis best at
second bass and shortstop, wh>h positions he
has filled for the cast season for th<Â»
American League Club of Philadelphia. La
Joie's phenomenal batting the past season
when he hit at a .422 gait, coupled with his
fast and accurate fielding, stamps him as one
of the greatest ballplayers of the dÂ«y. He is
captain of the star tfcam of American League
players now en route to this coast.

PRINCETONS WIN
FROM NAVY MEN
Sturdy Athletes Defeat
Blue Jackets on
Gridiron.
Rooters Watch Football Men
Roll and Tumble on
Muddy Field.
Twenty-two burly football hero 3frJJ
eleven from this side of the bay, undÂ«^*
the name of Princetons, and eleven from
Mare Island navy-yard, rolled and
trampled each other in the mud yester
day afternoon at the Sixteenth and Fol
som street grounds for the edification of
about 200 spectators. The Princetons
emerged from tha contest and incidental
ly from the mud, with a victory to their
credit by a srore of i> to 0. The defeat,
however, does not prove the inability of
the blue jackets to play football, as they
were obviously handicapped- by the
weight and better training of their op
ponents.
The blue jackets came from the navy
yard determined to vanquish their city
opponents. They brought with them a
well organized party of rooters, who
made the welkin ring with their inspiring
slogan, "Sons of the navy, play football. "
Under the encouragement of this cry the
boys from the navy-yard would grow
more vigorous in their plunges or more
determined in their resistance. Their
labors, however, were all to no purpose.
The local athletes proved themselves bet
ter adapted to wallowing in the mud.
In the flrst half the Princetons scored
their only touchdown through a magnifi
cent end run of fifty yards by right half
back Stewart. He was carried around tb.e
end by the stonewall interference of full
back Clapp. He was tackled within five
yards of the goal line. The ball was car
ried over by a couple of straight bucks
by full-back Clapp. In the latter part of
the flrst half the blue jackets narrow Â»
missed scoring a field goal. Left-end C
made a try for the goal from the twen
ty-yard line, with the ball almost direct
ly in front of the goal posts. The pig
skin, however, swerved a little too far
to the left of the posts. This was prac
tically the only occasion on which the
Princetons' goal was endangered.
The blue jackets started" the second
half with renewed vigor, and for a few
minutes threatened to sweep their heavi
er opponents across the field. Their vim,
however, scon evaporated, and the ball
was see-sawed up and down the field for
the rest of the game. Toward the latter
part of the contest it required careful in
spection to decide what part of the strug
gling aggregation was mud and what
part player.
The line-up was as follows:

William McMann Re

Shoulder.
PoHcemen Have a Struggle
in Arresting His As
sailant.
A passenger on car 1149 of the Mission
street line, named Pietro Marchi, owner
of a fruit store at the corner of Twenty
fourth and Harrison streets, made things
lively last night for the motorman and
conductor. When the car reached Ingle
side he became boisterous and was eject
ed from the car. He forthwith fired four
shots at the motorman. William McMann,
one of which struck McMann on the left
shoulder, inflicting a painful, though not
a serious, wound. Later he took a shot
at Mounted Officer Hayes and was
clubbed into submission after a hard
fight. ' . ;->y* Â¦;â¢/;;'
Marchi got on at the lower end of the
run and was very boisterous all the way
out. When the car reached Ir.gleside he
was told that it would go no further, but
he refused to get off. He was finally eject
ed from the car. Just as the motorman
and conductor . entered the car to sit
down. Marchi appeared at the other end,
pointed a pistol at the two men and fired
four shots at them.
One of the bullets struck McMann, the
gripman, in the left shoulder. The Italian
men retreated. Mounted Police Officers
Hayes and Leonard, who were in the
neighborhood, heard the shots and went
after Marchi. When Hayes demanded his
surrender a shot fired at close range was
the answer. â¢ " , .
Leonard then jumped into the affray
and both officers charged Marchi ' with
drawn clubs and pistols. Marchi attempt
ed to use his pistol again, but it was
knocked out of his hand. It took a num
ber of blows frpm the officers' clubs to
quiet him, but he was finally subdued
and placed in irons.
Motorman McMann was hurried to the
Southern Pacific Company Hospital,
where his wound was dressed.
Marchi was taken in the patrol wagon to
the City and County Hospital, where sev
eral cuts in his head, caused by the im
pact of the police officers' clubs, were
dressed. He was finally % taken to the
Seventeenth-street station, where two
charges of assault with intent to commit

HALE FAVORS
LARGER NAVY
Says Congress Will Au
thorize Increase of
Officers and Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â "Congress
will provide a substantial though not an
extravagant increase of the navy during
the coming session. It will also authorize
an increase of the commissioned and en
listed forces."
This prediction was made this afternoon
by Senator Eugene Hale of Maine, chair
man of the Senate naval committee.
"It is difficult to exactly estimate the
extent of the increase Congress will au
thorize," continued the Senator, "but I
hardly believe it will be as gTeat as the
department and the naval boards whose
advice has been sought desire. Congress
must make large appropriations, not only
for current expenses, but for the improve
ment of rivers and harbors, the construc
tion of the isthmian canal, etc. It is our
aim to distribute the appropriations as
soon as possible. The naval estimates for
the next fiscal year are almost $100,000,
00 larger than they have ever been.
"Congress must, therefore, carefully
consider what it shall do in the way of
augmentng the navy. Undoubtedly, the
policy of a steady increase should be con
tinued, and I will earnestly support it. I
am in favor of the construction of fast,
well-protected and heavily armored cruis
ers rather than battleships, because I be
lieve them capable of more effective ser
vice. I doubt if Congress will consent to
authorize the large increase of the com
missioned force desired by the depart
ment, though it will probably authorize
the appointment of a sufficient number of
cadets at the naval academy to prevent
under officering of the ships.
"It is not the intention of Congress that
all the ships should be kept in commis
sion, but that some of them should be
laid up in ordinary, ready to enter into
commission the moment they are needed.
Consequently a large increase of officers
is unnecessary. The enlisted strength of
the navy is insufficient, and provision for
its increase will be made."

YOUNG LADIES OF ST. PATRICK'S
PARISH ARRANGE A BIG "AT HOME"
Hundreds of Pretty Hostesses Will' Welcome Guests and See They
Enjoy Meny Time at Function Which Has Been Planned to
Raise Money and Incidentally Avoid Usual Church Fair Scheme
OAKLAND, Nov. 24.â The young
ladies of St. Patrick's Parish
are going to give the biggest "at
home" that West Oakland ever
had. It will be held in the Audi
torium, on Tenth street, near Peralta,
and will be in progress from November
28 to November 30. The hostesses will
be several hundred strong. The guests
will be everybody that wishes to be en
tertained.
The idea originated with the Rev. J.
B. McNally, pastor of St. Patrick's
Church. Father McNally does not ap
prove, he says, of the regulation church
fair. He wants to get out of the rut â
wants to give the young folks of the
parish a good time during the Thanks
giving season, and at the same time
gather in a few dollars to meet general
expenses.
With these objects in view he called to
gether the young ladies of the parish, and
after several meetings the details were
arranged for a grand social carnival.
The Auditorium will be decorated to
READY TO FIGHT
RAILROAD TRUST
Governor of Minnesota
Declares Against
Big Combine.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 24.â The Pioneer
Press to-morrow will say:
Governor Van Bant has determined to
fight the great railway combine as repre
sented by the Northern Securities Com
pany, to the last ditch. He has decided to
call an extra session of the Legislature
for the purpose of providing funds for the
legal battle, and says that should the
Legislature fail to appropriate the
amount asked, he will use his own private
fortune to carry on the contest.
While he declines to make public his
plans for prosecuting the fight, the Gov
ernor does not deny that he has decided
upon an extra session. This decision was
reached after a protracted conference
with the heads of the various depart
ments and the chairman of the House
Committee on Appropriations. One hun
dred thousand dollars will be asked for to
cover the expenses of hiring counsel to
assist the Attorney General and for other
emergencies. Beyond appropriating the
money the Governor does not believe that
the Legislature can aid him materially.
The anti-trust and anti-consolidation laws
now upon the statute books of this State
are looked upon as embodying the limit of
legislative powers and the fight will be
made in the courts.
Although the Governor does not antici
pate that the Legislature will hesitate to
appropriate the sum asked for, he states
that should it do so he will use his private
fortune to carry on the struggle until it
is exhausted or until he has gained a de
cisive victory.
The call for the extra session will prob
ably not be made until the first of the
year and the date of the convening will
very likely be February 1.

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 24.â Word comes
from Lower California of another crime
to be added to the long list of those

who is wanted on both sides of the boun
dary. After the attempt to capture Mo
rales eight or ten months ago, he repeat

BERKELEY, Nov. 24.â John T. Camp

no word has been heard of him sines.
This is his second mysterious disappear

JAPAN TRIUMPHS
OVER THE CZAR
Obtains From Korea
Concession Wanted
by Russia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 24.â Japanese mail ad
vices received to-day state that Japan has
scored a victory over Russia in obtaining
from Korea an exclusive concession for
a large settlement at Chapakpo, near
Masampo. Several months ago Russian
men-of-war landed marines at Masampo
and surveyed a tract of land amounting
to 750 acres. It was apparent that Russia
intended to demand either absolute title
or a long time lease of this tract, thereby
obtaining a permanent foothold on the
Korean coast. By strong representations
at Seoul Japan checkmated this move and
prevented its consummation.
Japanese diplomacy has since been ex
erted to the fullest extent in gaining such
influence at Seoul as would make possible
the acquiring of this same property in
the interests of Japan. Three weeks ago
the Korean Government officially an
nounced that the concession covering the
entire 750 acres had been made in Japan's
favor. Japan is to have the policing of
the now settlement, and must purchase
any portion owned by Korean subjects
within one year.

Gee is said to have struck Evans. The
latter left the house but returned in about
an hour and challenged McGee to a duel.
The proposition was refused. Before
others could interfere Evans drew his re
volver and fired, the bullet penetrating
McGee's lung. As McGee was falling he
pulled his revolver and fired at Evans,
but missed. McGee died to-night.

BEATING DRIVES
HIM TO INSANITY
Otto Hessman Ends His
Life After Thrashing
by A. Stenbiht.
Tragic Ending of a Career
Marked by Martial Un
happiness.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 24.â Driven to despair
by marital misfortunes and brooding over
a severe beating inflicted upon 1 him by Ar
thur Stenbiht, whom he accused of alien- j
ating the affections of his wife, Otto Hess- ;
man committed suicide early this morn- |
ing by inhaling illuminating gas. His j
body was discovered about 11 a. m. in a ';
bedroom in the Hesaman Institute build- \
ing, 1042 Central avenue, by, E. E. Blake,
who went there for the purpose of in- j
specting a piano he intended to purchase, j
Extending from a gas jet into the sui- i
cide's mouth was a section of rubber tub- j
ing. So dense was the fatal gas in the j
death chamber that it permeated the hall- j
way adjoining and partially stifled Hess- j
man's faithful dog, which was lying out- I
side the bedroom door.
On a table- near the body was found the Â¦
following note marked "copy," and "Rec'd :
Nov. 22," addressed to Hessman by his j
wife and signed by her:
Mr. Otto Hessmanâ Dear Sir: I have rented j
1001 Taylor avenue and the tenants are in- i
stalled. Please do not call there, a3 they are !
not like the "Hymans." I have also rented j
this lower flat. The tenant will move in next
Monday, so you must find other quarters.
Yours truly, CLARA T. HESSMAN.
Suicide Leaves Note.
With the foregoing was also the follow
ing in Hessman's handwriting:
That she borrowed money from a friend of
mtna under false pretenses and foolishly in- ;
dorsed a note of $225; that about a month after I
she tried to borrow another $350 from the same
party, but I stopped such transaction; that I
had been advised, perhaps for eight years, to
look out for my wife or pack up and leave i
her. but I believed her to be true.
Hessman was last seen alive at Kriete's ;
saloon, Ninth street and Santa Clara
avenue, last night shortly before 12
o'clock. Friends who were with him then
assert that he was sober, but very de
spondent because of the thrashing and
injuries he had received at the hands of i
Arthur Stenbiht during the afternoon. !
When Hessman left Kriete's place it is j
presumed he retired to his room in the
flessman Institute building, which for
merly belonged to him, and which he
deeded to his wife some time ago. He had
lived* there for years with his wife. Since
she commenced suit for a divorce, several
weeks ago, Hessman has roomed there
alone. Mrs. Hessman has roomed at 1001
Taylor avenue, which property stands also
in her name.
Hessman was employed by the South
ern Pacific Company in San Francisco as
a draughtsman. He came home early yes
terday afternoon, and acting on the ad
vice of friends secured a short riding
whip and went to 1001 Taylor avenue to
see his wife and to horsewhip Stenbiht,
whom he accused as co-respondent in the
cross-complaint filed in his wife's suit for
divorce. When Hessman rang the bell
the door was opened by Stenbiht.
Hessman Accuses Stenbiht.
"You are the man who wrecked my hap
piness and home," shouted the excited
husband, as he lashed furiously at Sten
biht.
The latter being younger, stronger and
more active, grappled with Hessman and
knocked him down time and again. Neigh
bors interfered to stop the combat, but
before this was done Hessman's eyes were
blackened and closed and he was cut in
numerous places about the face. All these
details of the fight were learned by the
police to-day when they investigated the
case. The authorities endeavored to lo
cate Stenbiht and Mrs. Hessman, but
were informed that they had gone to San
Francisco.
In her suit for divorce, Mrs. Hessman
charged her husband with extreme cruelty
and habitual intemperance, alleging that
he had threatened to kill her with a knife
and pistol, and that he had called at sa
loons and asked for her in order to humil
iate her. Hessman, in an answer, denied
all the foregoing charges and allegations,
and filed a cross-complaint in which he
accused his wife of lavishing her affec
tions upon Stenbiht.
The Hessmans have resided here about
twelve years. They had no children. Mrs.
Hessman conducts a private commercial
school known as the Hessman Institute.
Hessman was a German, aged about 50
years. Stenbiht is an architect.
Deputy Coroner James Fowler removed
Hessman's body to the local branch
morgue, where an inquest will be held.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, Nov. 24.â An old man and a
young boy drove up to one of the local
livery stables on Friday evening and
asked to be allowed to remain over night
in the corral. The fine appearance of their
horses and equipment arrested the atten
tion of the liveryman, and, while looking
around, ho noticed what appeared to be
a coffin in the wagon. When pressed for
an explanation, the old man said:
"You see, we don't like to sleep away
from the wagon; my dead wife is in there.
My grandson and myself are on our way
to Kelseyville, Lake County, Oregon. My
wife has been dead eighteen months,
placed her in that casket you see and
kept her in the house until we started for
California. It has been in the wagon ever
sineÂ©, and I am going to bury her in Kel
seyville." , Â . , .. .
The two lonely travelers pitched their
camp, cooked their supper, and then pre
pared to sleep; and to one passing the
silent camp the dying flames of the camp
fire throwing intermittent flashes of light
on the wagon, the outlines of the casket
which held the dead wife of the sleeping
man could bo seen.

SLASHES HIS THROAT
John Brouillard Tries to Commit Sui
cide in a Tankhonse at
West Oakland.
OAKLAND, Nov. 24.â Supposed de
spondency because of family troubles led
John Brouillard, a blacksmith, to attempt
to commit suicide last night by cutting
his throat.
He was found half conscious and cov
ered with blood this morning in a tank
house at the rear of F. Sicotte's residence,
1685 Eighth street. Brouillard was hur
ried to the Receiving Hospital, where a
gash three inches long in his throat waj
sewed up. The doctors say he will re
cover.
Sicotte explained that the despondent
blacksmith, whom he knew quite well,
arrived in town last evening from Point
Richmond, where he had been working
in the Santa Fe Railroad shops. Brouil
lard wanted a place to sleep and was
given quarters in the tankhou3e. One of
the family went out this morning an<i
discovered Brouillard' s condition. Tha
injured man told the hospital attendants
that he had been an inmate of the StatÂ»
hospital at Agnews seven years ago. He
has a divorced wife residing in San
Francisco, who was notified of her former
husband's condition.
She went to the hospital and declared
that Brouillard was insane. He will bs
held for examination by the Lunacy
Commissioners.

CONTRACTED DISORDERS.
UNDER THE TREATMENT PURSUED BE- "
fore irrigations were established, six weeks
was deemed the duration of an acute contracted
disorder. If It proceeded beyond six weeks it .
was considered to have gone into Â¦ a , chronic
condition. From statistics compiled from our
practice in : the past five years, covering over
600 cases, we can show that 90 per cent of our
patients have recovered in . fourteen days or
less. It is, therefore, equally proper to hold
that a case : not entirely cured within two
weeks must be considered a chronic one, and
some complication has arisen for which ; thÂ«
patient should see a specialist. We invite free
consultation on Â¦ this subject and offer an ex-
perience of over twenty years; in fact, we can
I positively . assert that . we have never failed to -
I cure in a single Instance. PHRH^Hpis
! All â¢' Varicoccles Should Be Cured
Varicocele Is an enlargement of the most
vital blood vessels In man. The function of
these veins is to carry off waste, thus enabling
the organs to receive fresh nutrition. The dis-
ease consists of a dilation and local stagnation
of blood, from which the organs are deprived
of their proper quantity and quality of nour-
ishment. Varicocele is a very common diÂ»-
order. " Statistics show that 25 per cent of the
male population are afflicted' with some stage
of the disease. "We emphatically guarantee to
cure varicocele in ; one week -at our â¢office, 'or
four weeks of home treatment. - We have cured
over 3000 cases without a single failure or un-
pleasant result. We mean by a cure, re-
establishment of nutrition of the organ, and its
function win be restored. We have. shown this
result so often and can refer to so many cases
in . proof 'of â¢ this statement that we make .It
without hesitation or reserve. We ' invite cor-
respondence ; and the fullest investigation â¢of
our methods. - Â¦ ____ -V. Â¦''.; -

Meet Death on a Handcar.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 24.â Word has
just been received here of a frightful ac
cident that occurred near Osage City,
Wyo., last Friday night. The Osage City
section gang were returning from New
castle on their handcar when they were
struck by a freight train. Charles Ander
son and Carl Lentz were killed, their bod
ies being horribly mangled, and Foreman
Smith seriously injured.
PAN-AMERICAN
RAILWAY SCHEME
Ex-Senator Davis Says
the Project Is Not
Visionary.
Believes That the Funds for
Construction Can Be
Easily Raised.
MEXICO CITY, Nov 24.â The report of
ex-Senator Henry C. Davis to the Pan-
American railway committee of the In
ternational American Conference will be
submitted to the session of the conference
on Wednesday next. Davis suggested
that a sub-committee be appointed to"
study his report, but hi 9 colleagues would
not hear of anything of the sort, and
adopted his report unanimously. Davis
says In his report that there is nothing
impracticable nor visionary in ' the con
struction of the road or the flotation of
the necessary stock. He remarks that
each of such systems as the Pennsylva
nia, the New York Central, the Atchison,
the Northern Pacific, the Union Paoific,
the Southern Pacific, the Southern Rail
way and others has a greater mileage
than is how necessary to assure the reai.
zation of the inter-continental railroad,
while the bonds and shares outstanding
of each of such systems are in excess of
Ihe sum estimated as necesary for the
construction of the railroad in question.
The Russian Government has just com
pleted, says the Senator, a railroad
through Siberia at a ccst considerably in
excess of the amount estimated as neces
sary for the completion of an American
inter-contlnental railroad, and in doing so
has overcome greater natural difficulties
than are to be looked for in the construc
tion of the latter.
Davis estimates the mileage of the in
ter-continental railroad to be constructed
at 5000 miles in order to link existing sys
tems, and calculates the cost at $200,000,
00, or at the rate of $40,000 per mile.
The report terminates with the follow
ing recommendations:
Firstâ That a railroad connecting all or the
greater pa/t of the nations represented in the
conference will contribute powerfully to the
development of the material relations and in
terests of the said nations.
Secondâ That the said railroad ought, as far
as common Interests permit, to connect the
principal cities situated along its route.
Thirdâ That If the direction of the railroad
cannot be changed for the object stated in the
foregoing article without great inconvenience
branches should be built to connect the chief
cities with the main line.
Fourthâ That in order to lessen the cost of
work existing railroads be utilized as far as
possible and as far as compatible with the
location and purposes of the inter-continental
raih-oad.
Fifthâ That all the material necessary for
the construction and operation of the railroad
be declared free from import duties, while
taking suitable measures to prevent abuses.
Sixthâ That property, real and movable, of
the railroad employed in construction and
operation of the road be exempted from all
national, provincial, State and municipal tax
ation.
Seventhâ That the realization of a work of
such magnitude deserves to be encouraged by
means of subventions, land grants or guaran
tees oi- minimum rate of interest.
Eighthâ That the railroad be declared forever
r.eutral in order to assure freedom of traffic.
Ninthâ That the delegates to the conference
recommend with all possible earnestness to
their several Governments the granting of lib
eral concessions to the enterprise, in such form
as may appear most suitable to each Govern
ment.
The suggestion is made that the United
States send a competent person to all of
the republics of Amer'ca to study the re
sources of the several countries, the loca
tion and status of existing railroads, pros
pective traffic for the railroad when built
and the concessions each Government
i would be disposed to grant. It is also
suggested the committee become per
manent.

BERLIN BOERSE
SHOWS STRENGTH
Considerable Activity Is
Shown in Iron and
Bank Shares.
Business in the London Stock
Exchange Remains Al
most Lifeless.
BERLIN, Nov. 24.^The improvement on
the Boerse continues, all the departments
showing gains for the past week. The j
fact is again in evidence that many short I
engagements existed, causing a strong
movement to cover, as a result of which
valuations rose. Last week's trading
strengthens the Impression that the mar- j
ket is gradually regaining confidence. In |
financial circles great importance was at- ;
tached to the statement of President |
Koch of the Imperial Bank of Germany j
to the effect that there was reason to be
lieve the worst was now over. The recent j
financial crisis has been worse in Saxony,
and there especially a strong feeling of
confidence prevails.
Another, iactor favoÂ«able to the week s
Improvement was the reduction in the
price of coke, amounting to 2 marks a
ton for furnaces and to 4^ marks a ton I
for foundry quality. This reduction in
coke created a considerable demand for
iron shares, which were the strongest fea
ture of the week's trading. Iron shares
rose more than 10 points during the week,
and after a long period of neglect machin
ery securities aiso rose.
It ls significant that the Lorraine and
Luxberg furnaces suffered reduction in
the price of coke with a further restric
tion of their output 50 per cent.
Bank stocks were the second strongest
feature during the week and were ani
mated on the prospect of improving busi
ness on the Boerse. This caused much
short covering.
Another feature was the resumption of
purchases in the iron and coal shares for
foreign account and the prospect of
American coal being imported into Ger-'
many were discussed from various points
of view. A wholesale coal dealer, Herr
Schulz, who has just returned from the
United States, where he ordered 140,000
tons of anthracite coal, says that no dan
ger threatens Germany from American
coal. The Frankfurter Zeitung does not
agree with Herr Schulz and says that
Germany must sooner or later expect a
strong competition from American coal as
well as from American iron products. This
paper advises the coal and iron men of
Germany to get together in time to meet
this expected competition.
The general introduction of the Govern
ment's report, explaining the new tariff
bill, has appeared. It is assailed by the
Liberal press with arguments pronounc
ing it weak and contradictory. The Ber
liner Tageblatt says this introduction
shows the lack of business reasons for
the increase of duties introduced by the
bill and that the Government has been
merely moved }n this action by its desire
to please the Agrarians.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â Business on the
Stock Exchange has been so nearly dead
during the last week that the develop
ments are hardly worth recording. Money
has been alternately scarce and plentiful,
owing to the fitful Government disburse
ments and to large payments on account
of various colonial loans. The Bank of
England has managed to impound most
of the available gold. The open market
rate of discount closed firmer, but still
below the bank rate. American securities
alone displayed a suggestion of activity
on the Exchange.
A general feeling of apprehension for
the future prevented real business and
quotations are largely nominal. Home
rails declined a shade in spite of the im
proved traffic reports. Mines were stag
nant.
First Ship Built in Chile.
SANTIAGO DE CHILE, Nov. 24.â The
launch of the first iron steamer construct
ed In Chile occurred at Valparaiso to-day
and was a great success. The ceremony
was attended by the President, the Fed
eral authorities and a large assemblage
of people. The entire ship, from keel to
truck, was constructed In this country.

WI TTMAN ORDERS
GAMING STOPPED
New Police Chief De
clares Himself on the
Question.
Instructs All Company Com
manders to Enforce
, the Law.
Chief of Police Wittman does not in
tend to pel lit gambling In any form m
this city. an.:l has ordered the men under
his corr.msr.u bo keep a sharp lookout for
illegal games. During the illness of bis
predecessor a few games were started is
experiments, but as fast as the places
where they -were conducted were located
: hey irere promptly closed.
In order that there might be no misun
derstanding about his position in the mat
ter. Chief of Police Witiman has issued
the following: general ord^r, which was
read yesterday to each watch:
Office of the Chief of Polie*.
November 24, 1901.
Company commanders: Information comes to
this office that an attempt to establish gaui
bMnK frames that are In violation of the law
Â¦sviil be made in the different sections of this
. nd I would impress upon you the fact
that I will hold each and every one in the
"Vpartinent responsible if a successful carry
t is made in this scheme.
You Â¦will instruct the sergeants in section and
ihe patrolman on liss beat to be particularly at
â¢ to this order and report immediately
any circumstance that would cause suspicion of
r<n attempt to on^n up or run any illegal gam-
Ming game, and at once use the most 6tringent
measure? possible to suppress said gambling.
Company commanders and lieutenants in
charge of dtvtetooi will be held equally re
ble with the sergeants and patrolmen in
the enforjCÃMOt of this order.
x his order is imperative and must be obeyed.
GEORGE. TV. TVITTMAN, Chief of Police.
In anticipation of an easy time at the
hands of the new Chief of Police, before
the appointment had been made and his
policy could be announced, several places
had been fitted up for gambling purposes.
Games were run for a night or two, but
the majority have packed away their lay
outs and prepared to go into some other
and more legitimate line of business.
"-WO MEN FOUND DEAD
IN LODGING-HOUSES
Cne Supposed to Be Walter W. More
head and the Other 6. B.
Robinson.
Walter W. Morehead, about 40 years of
age. was found dead in his bed at the
Elcho lodging-house, 863^ Market street,
yesterday morning by .he bedmaker. Dep
uty Coroner Brown removed the body to
the Morgue. The man had been dead two
or three days. On a table was found a
beer bottle, half-filled, and on the floor a
paper, which is supposed to have con
tained some drug. It is believed that
Morehead committed suicide, and the beer
and stomach will be sent to the city
chemist for analysis.
Morehead engaged the room last
Wednesday from Gus Emme, the clerk,
paying 'a week in advance. In his pockei.
was found a card showing he was coast
solicitor for a baby nammock. On the
card was the address S?9 Howard street.
Deputy Brown went there and ascer
tained that Morehead had not lived there
for four months past, but had since calle : .
to sell cheap perfumery to the girl room
ers.
Yesterday afternoon a man was found
dead in his room at Mrs. Matilda Bhrm's
lodging-house, 504 Howard street. He en
gaged a room Friday night and another
room Saturday night. It is not known
whether it is a case of suicide or not. In
the man's pocket was found a newspaper
receipt in the name of "G. B. Robinson."
He was a.bout 50 years of age, five feet ten
inches tall, weighed ISC pounds, had
brown hair and eyes and a fair mustache.
His general appearance was that of a la
boring man. He wore a navy blue suit
and a blue negligee shirt.
Burglars in a Grocery.
Three men broke into the grocery of H.
F. Schlichting, 915 Bryant street, about 1
o'clock yesterday morning. Schlichting,
who lives upstairs, was awakened by the
crash of glas=s. and suspecting something
was wrong blew a police whistle. He saw
three men run away from the store, but
owing to the darkness was unable to rec
ognize them. When he made an investi
gation he discovered that the glass in
both the front and rear doors had been
broken and a quantity of liquors and
cigars had been packed on top of the
counter ready to be carried away. He
notified the police yes-erday morning.

EMPLOYE FINDS ABANDONED BABY
IN THE MANSION LODGING-HOUSE
Weil-Dressed Woman Rents a Room, and After Her Departure
Bedmaker Finds Three-Day-Old Boy Asleep in the Blankets.
Infant Is Sent to Emergency Hospital and Police Are Notified
A BRIGHT baby boy, whose span of
life encompasses no more than
three days, u> at the Central
Emergency Hospital, while the
police are endeavoring to ascer
tain the name of the woman who aban
doned the infant in a Mission street lodg
ing-house some time between midnight of
Saturday and noon of Sunday.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1901.
INFANT THAT WAS ABANDONED
IN LODGING-HOUSE BY WELL
DRESSED WOMAN SATURDAY.
"When Fritz Sheet the bedmaker of the
Mansion House, at 963 Mission street, was
making his rounds be) ween 11 and 12
o'clock yesterday he went into a room on
the first floor that he had rented about
midnight to a well dressed woman. The
room was vacant and he proceeded to
make the bed. He started to pull off the
bedclothes, and found an infant quietly
slumbering-. The child lay tucked in a
blanket and upon two pillows. Scheef
summoned the woman who conducts the
house and the police were notified.
LEAVES GEMS
IN STREETCAR
Mrs. Churchill Is Very
Careless With Her
Diamonds.
Mrs. E. W. Churchill of 909 Linden
street, Oakland, is congratulating herself
on the recovery of $1500 worth of dia
monds, which she lost while visiting the
city Saturday evening. The diamonds
were in a chamois bag, which, according
to Mrs. Churchill, was stolen from her
either on' the ferryboat or while she was
making some purchases on this side of
the bay. Â«_Â¦*Â». ,
Shortly after she had reported the al
leged robbery to the police yesterday,
Captain Seymour was Informed by tele
phone that the diamonds had been found
by W. H. Craig, a conductor of a car of
the Halght-street line. He had found the
precious stones on the seat of the car Just
after Mrs. Churchill had alighted.
Craig turned the gems over to the su
perintendent of the road, who, upon learn
ing that Mrs. Churchill was the owner,
gave them to her.
HEBREWS FORM SOCIETY
TO RELIEVE DISTRESS
Rabbi M. S. Levy Addresses Members
and Urges Co-operation in
Good Work.
The San Francisco Hebrew Relief So
ciety met last night in B'nai B'rith Hall
for the purpose of perfecting its organi
zation and to create interest in its work.
The address of the evening was delivered
by Rabbi M. S. Levy, who briefly detailed
the aims and purposes of a society formed
to relieve distress in the southern section
of the city. Dr. Levy urged his hearers
to help the movement, as there were
many who were deserving of help from
their more fortunate brothers. Dr. Levy
compared the charity of the poor and the
rich and said that the smaller gifts of the
former were as praiseworthy in the sight
of God as the larger offerings of the lat-
J. Goldstein, president of the society,
stated that there are now 300 members on
the roll and that actual work had already
been commenced. The following named
officers were chosen:
J. Goldstein, president; J. L. Abram
owitz, vice president; M. Rosenberg, sec
retary; I. Harland, treasurer; H. Marks,
A. Davis, M. Goldblath, B. Marcus, J.
Harland and M. Wise, trustees.
Lad Vanquishes Footpad.
Herbert Waddington, 16 years of age,
employed as a clerk in the drug store at
the corner of Geary and Octavia streets,
while on his way home about 9 o'clock on
Saturday night, was held up as he was
passing the Unitarian Church at the cor
ner of Franklin and Geary streets. A
man jumped out of the shadows and de
manded young Waddington' s watch and
money. The boy was carrying an um
brella in his hand and brought it down on
the fellow's head. This conftised and stag
gered the would-be footpad, and young
Waddington made the best possible time
he could toward his home.

Police Officer Morlarity responded, and
calling the patrol wagon had the infant
conveyed to the Central Emergency
Hospital. The child, was examined there
and the physicians in attendance gave it
as their opinion that the boy was not
more than three days old. He was place 1
In charge of the nurses, and soon made
friends with the rubber end of. a nursing
bottle, to his evident catisfaction.
There was nothing about the infant to
Indicate its maternity. It was warmly
clothed in the usual accessories of a
baby's wardrobe. A pink and white
striped tennis flannel nightgown, a while
lama cloth coat and an infant's cap, also
of white material, were on the infant.
Fritz Sheef, the bedmaker, says:
A woman came to the house three nights ago
who looked like the one who rented the room
last night. I did not Day much attention to
her, but she was pretty well dressed. I showed
her several rooms, and she said she would call
again. About 1 o'clock last night a womaa
came and rented the front room on the first
floor. I lighted the lamp In her room and left
her.
I went Into the room about noon to-day, and
found the baby In the bed. It looked as If
some one had slept in the bed during the night,
but it was not much mussed. I did not hear
anybody come In or out during the night, and
the woman who rented the room had nothing
in her hand.
According to Sheef, the woman seemed
pleased that a dim lamp was the only
means of lighting the room, the gas usu
ally being turned off Â»n the house before
midnight. There are two entrances to the
house, one on Mission street, the main
entrance, and a secontf one at the rear,
used in common by a number of adjoining
buildings of the same character.
The theory of the pclice is that the
woman after engaging the room went out
and secured the infant and hushed it to
sleep, or that it was brought to her by
some person from the outside, who was
made cognizant of the location of the
room.
The infant will be sent to-day to Mount
St. Joseph's Infant Asjlum unless the
mother is located in the meanwhile.
THINKS FIANCE
WAS MURDERED
Edna Cannon Is Anxious
Over Disappearance
of Alex X Bell.
The police of this city have been asked
to locate Alex K. Bell, who came here
from Portland a short time ago. Bell
was to have married Miss Edna Cannon
of Portland last Wednesday, but on the
eve of the wedding he suddenly disap
peared. An investigation revealed that he
had informed a friend that he was about
to leave for this city to settle up some
business matters. It is known that Bell
arrived here last Thursday, but since
then no trace of him has been found.
Before leaving Portland he told a Mr.
McCusker, who is a brother-in-law of
the bride to be, that he was feeing ill
and that he intended to come to this city
to seek medical advice. On learning of
his disappearance and thinking that he
might be seriously ill Mr. McCusker
came to this city last Friday and ap
pealed to Captain of Detectives Seymour
to find him.
Seymour had his men search the vari
ous hospitals for Bell, but they failed to
get a trace of him. Miss Cannon, who is
a very estimable young woman, fears
that her prospective husband is tho vic
tim of foul play. She cannot account for
his failure to keep his promise to marry
her, except that he was suddenly bereft
of his reason on account of sickness.
WATCHES FOR THE MAN
WHO TAKES HIS PAPEJt
George Maxwell Beats H. A. Lafler
and Is Arrested on Charge
of Battery.
George Maxwell, ex-secretary of the
Fire Department, was arrested yesterday
morning about 8 o'clock by Policeman
Sheehan and booked at the City Prison
on a charge of battery. He was released
on $5 cash bail. The complaining witness
against him is H. A. Lafler, who lives in
the neighborhood.
Maxwell's statement is that some one
had been annoying him by stealing The
Call from his doorstep, at 2048 Leaven
worth street, and yepterday morning ho
made up his mind to watch for the pape.
"lifter." He says he :iaw Lafler pick up
the paper and he immediately pounced
upon him. Lafler got mad and followel
Maxwell into his house, threatening to
thrash him. Maxwell stood it as long as
he could, and suddenly Lafler wondere-i
what had struck him, as he found hlrr.
self on the sidewalk. He complained to
Policeman Sheehan, and Maxwell's arre3t
followed.
Maxwell threatens to get even with
Lafler by swearing out a warrant for his
arrest to-day for petty larceny.
Advantages of Socialism.
Rev. J. E. Scott delivered a lecture on
"The Advantages of Socialism" before
Liberty Branch of the Socialist Demo
cratic party at Academy of Science Hall
last night. Mr. Scott expounded the prin
ciples of socialism, which, he said, were
destined to reorganize society on a proper
basis. He detailed at length what he rec
ognized as the advantages of socialism
and said that the movement would ulti
mately settle the labor question because
it teaches that the laborer should receive
the product of his labor or its equivalent.
MARCUS' DRAFT
FAILS TO ARRIVE
He Works Easterner by
Tale of Great Ex
pectations.
Sells Griswold Bogus Stock
and Give 3 Him Wild
goose Chase.
"If an individual bearing the name of
H. C. Marcus, of smooth appearance, in
gratiating manners and eloquent tongue,
tries to win your confidence by tales of
unbusiness-like banks in the East that
are neglecting to send him drafts for
plethoric sums, and follows up his at
tempt with a request for temporary relief,
tell him you're busted."
This is the advice that Allen S. Gris
wold, late of the Yale preparatory school
and now growing up with the West,* of
fers to the generously inclined of San
Francisco.
Marcus came before the public about six
weeks ago, through a supposed overdose
of laudanum, for which he was treated at
the Emergency Hospital. His story at
the time was that, feeling pains in his
stomach, he entered the fi*"st lodging
house to which he came, hired a room
and telephoned for a doctor. The doctor
did not come right away, so Mar
cus administered to himself, he said, a
few drops of laudanum. He was discov
ered by Dr. Mish, who telephoned to the
hospital for an ambulance. Marcus was
revived, and while at the hospital made
the acquaintance of Dr. jfc). A. Dlggins.
A few days later Marcus called on the
doctor, showed him pockets full of oil
stock and receipts for all kinds of money
and gave him inside information aa to
every sort of good thing. Then he told
Diggins the story of a draft which a care
less Philadelphia bank had failed to send
him. He wanted" a few dollars. The doc
tor said nay. Then he offered to put up
somo of his paper money as security.
Again nay from the doctor and nay again
when he suggested* that the doctor intro
duce him to some friend who might be
induced to help Mr. Marcus tide over the
financial vacuum caused by the non
arrival of the draft.
Keeps TJp Acquaintance.
Marcus still dropped in on Dlggins,
however, and one day, on parting, asked
the doctor to please telegraph to Phila
delphia for him and find out what was
delaying the draft. He did not give the
name of the bank, however, and when he
dropped in a few days later in company
with Allen S. Griswold, the doctor had re
ceived no news of the draft.
"Did you get any word from my draft.
Doc?" was the greeting.
Diggins started in to explain the impossi
bility of having done so, when Marcus in
terrupted him by introducing his friend
Griswold. The pair left together. This
was about three weaks ago.
Griswold returned a few days ago to in
quire as to the whereabouts of Diggins'
friend Marcus. Explanations followed
and Griswold told the following story:
He came out here a few months ago, he
said. He had taken a course at the Yale
preparatory school and had come West
for a whirl before entering college. He
whirled too much. The rotary motion
emptied his pockets and he found him
self penniless in a strange city. He wrote
home for money, but in the interval se
cured in a humble boarding-house a job
which insured him board and lodging.
It was here he met Marcus. Griswold,
attracted by the manner of the former,
told his story. It was a strange co
incidence. Marcus was in the same fix.
His remittance had gone astray, but his
doctor was keeping the wires hot finding
out the reason.
Griswold's remittance came.
Draft Still Missing.
"Let's go down to the doctor. I guess
he's got my draft by this time," said J
Marcus, "and we can go away and look
into those little propositions I have been
telling you about. There'll be a barrel of
money in it for both of us."
The result of the visit to the doctor's
has already been detailed.
Marcus took the non-arrival philosophi- j
cally. It was a draft of Croesian dimen
sions and well worth waiting for. Mar
cus was ' awfully short, however, and
would Griswold mindâ
Griswold didn't mind. He provided
Marcus with ready money. He bought
some of his oil stock. He bore the ex
pense of a trip to Stockton and paid a
week's lodging at the hotel for the pair.
He paid for a long telegram to the Phila
delphia bank directing an immediate my
vestigation of the draft's delay, and he
paid for other things.
One day Marcus informed him that his
draft was on the way, but that in the
meanwhile Griswold had better go to
Redding and look into a few good things
some of Marcus' friends were keeping
open for the missing draft.
Armed with letters of Introduction to
half a dozen of what Marcus said were
Redding's most influential citizens, Gris
wold went to Redding. Nobody in Red
ding knew any of the Marcus citizens.
Griswold's rusty alarm clock finally rang.
He returned to San Francisco thorough
ly awakened and visited Dr. Diggins. He
went to the office of the oil company in
which he held Marcus' stock and fpund
the stock worthless. His money is almost
gone, most of it by the Marcus route.
Saturday he took the balance and bought
a ticket to Bakersfield, where he has
some relatives. He says he is afraid to
stay in San Francisco, but if he thought
by doing so he could meet Marcus he
would take the risk. -
Dr. Sol C. Mish said fast evening in an
interview that he attended Marcus twice
for poisoning. The first time Marcus toox
poison was at the Sutherland Hotel. Ha
was removed to the Waldeck and prom
ised to pay the bill when he left, which
he failed to do. The second time Dr.
Mish was called he decided that the besi;
place for Marcus to be attended to was
the Emergency Hospital, where he event
ually was sent. Dr. Mish also states that
a barber by the name of Scott called upon
him and complained that Marcus had
sold him worthies oil stock and had se
cured $50 of his good money.
