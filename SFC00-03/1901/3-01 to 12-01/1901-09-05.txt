PRINCE CHUN, WHO AP
PEARED. BEFORE EMPEROR
WILLIAM YESTERDAY.
"If is no joyous or festive occasion, nor
the fulfillment of a simple act of cour
tesy, which brings your Imperial High
ness to me. but a deeply melancholy and
very serious event. My Minister to the
court of the Emperor of China has been
slain in the capital of China by the mur
derous weapons of Chinese soldiers acting
under superior commandâ an unheard of
crime, which- is branded as Infamous by
international law and the usages of all
nations. From. the mouth. of your Impe
rial Highness I have just received an ex
pression of the deep "regret of the Em
peror.; of China. I readily believe your im
perial brother personally stood aloof from
this crimed and from such acts of violence
against^ " thej/ linviolable legations - and
peaceful foreigners.' All the greater is the
guilt resting on his advisers Govern
ment." .The i latter, must, not delude them
selves "with 'the belief that they are able
to obtain atonement and pardon for their
guilty expiation mission alone. I They will
be "judged by their'- future conduct in'ac
cordance with the laws of nations. If the
Emperor of China Â¦ conducts the Govern
ment -, of 'his great "empire henceforth
strictly in the. spirit of these prescrip
tions then will his "hopes be. fulfilled and
the . results of the \ complications !. of the
Emperor William in reply said:
Emperor's Stern. Reply.
"I am in a position to assure your
Majesty that the Emperpr, my most gra
ciousjiiaster, stood aloof from' these com
plications . which brought misfortune
on China and; loss and care upon Ger
many. Nevertheless, in accordance with
the customs of thousands of years, the
Empercr of China has taken the blame
on his own sacred person. I have there
fore the task of expressing to. your Majes
ty the. most cordial; feelings of the Em-,
peror, my Illustrious master, toward your
Imperial Majesty and the whole imperial
family. I hope the passing cloud will ef
fectually intensify the succeeding sun
shine and the mutual friendship of the
two great empires when they understand
the value of each other better."

"Ever since the empires have been mu

Prince Chun at the Orangery. " Later in

SCHLEY WHO ARE PREPARING
FOR COURT OF INQUIRY.
There will be no race to-morrow, and'
while the yacht committee held a.meet
ing to-day â¢ no announcement of future
races was made.
The tiandicap at the start seemed to be
due to a lack of smartness aboard the
Constitution" and also to ' the more able
sea jockeying of those in charge of the
Columbia. The Constitution allowed her
self to be forced on the wrong side of the
line and was compelled â¢ to gybe around
short on her heel and then to take ' the
other end of the line, a deadly ; handicap.
This and the splitting of her' balloon jib
topsail certainly lost' her the race. Had
it not been for these mishaps the-Consti
tution would have beaten the Columbia
â¢by a small margin beyond the 1 minute 11
seconds allowance over the course. â¢Â¦ â¢ '
tered In segments aloft, and all hands ha.'l
to do their best to â¢ muzzle, it. -. On the
other hand, the Columbia hauled down
her balloon jib topsail in seamanllke style
and. smartly bending on the spinnaker
halyards, hoisted a reaching jib- topsail
in stops and, breaking it out quickly,
darted across the line a winner. In tak
ing in spinnakers about twenty minutes
before the " finish line was reached the
Constitution's sail got tangled in the
headstay*s and it took several minutes to
get it on deck. While flapping aloft the
balloon jib topsail' had no opportunity to
exert its utmost drawing power. ": At this
time the Columbia's ballooner was doing
most effective work. To smart handling
and excellent judgment the Columbia's
victory to-day was due._ There is no ques
tion that the old mainsail and the altered
headsails of the Constitution,, which' sho
carried to-day, had much to dp with the
improved showing she made.
In heavy puffs when close to the finish
line her. balloon jib topsail split in two
and caused a big tangle aloft. The Co
lumbia was compelled to haul down her
bajlooner at the same time, for the squall
carried away the cringle at the head of
the sail. But the big sail on the Consti
tution refused to be controlled and flut-

Subsequently Mr. Nicholl said: "I don't want
any fuss made over this thins or over the cere
mony, and I know you don't You go right
down and order a tailor-made suit and new
bonnet and. some day I will- come for you Just
And I said: "Well, as I have no home, 1
think it would be as well for me to marry
you." and then he said: . (
"You will marry me?" and I said "Yes,"
and then he embraced me.
I said:. -"Yes; I had thought so for some
time, but as I had not ever thought of marry
ing in- my life and had not a dollar in the
world to bring a man, I had put the thought
away from me."
And Mr. Nicholl said: "Weil, what do you
think of it now?"
I replied ""What Is that." ar.d he said: "I
am going to marry you, that is if you will
let me," and I said "Yes."
He said: "Didn't you know that I wanted
to marry you?"
On November 10, 1893, Mr. Nicholl came for
me parly In the afternoon to go out to tails
over something. This was in. fulfillment of a
promise that. I had made to him on the pre
vious day. While -we were driving around
toward the hills Mr. Nicholl said to me:
"Jane, do you know what I am going to do
with you, that is. if you will let me?**
â¢ Asks Her to Marry Him.
This lonely old man asked his sprightly
cousin to become his wife. He was in need
of a companion although his two unmar
ried daughters, Miss Mary Nicholl and
Miss Hester Nicholl, had been very good
to their father, trying to occupy their
dead mother's place at the . beautiful
home, 1351 Fourth avenue. The story of
the engagement was told by Miss Hodge
In the following narrative, a portion of
her testimony when she was called upon
to give a deposition before the trial:
"With the news of the settlement inter
est has been revived in the long fight
which waged between the contending pair.
The rich landowner who counts his acres
by thousands and his city blocks by a
score, being worth half a million, was 75
years old when he won Miss Hodge. She
was well along in life, having touched 48
years when the widower came to her
home and offered his hand In marriage.
"JIarry Mr. Nicholl now? No, indeed.
not after the way he made a fool of me.
"I am very glad of this opportunity to
make public the close of the litigation,
for with the end of it to-day I feel that
my friends will understand that I was In
no sense mercenary in my contest"
Attorney George W. Reed, when asked
about . the compromise, said: "I shall
neither affirm nor deny In the matter, as
it is a subject not within my province to
discuss."
V 'I instructed my attorneys so. to ar
range any settlement which might be of
fered by Mr. Nicholls. Yesterday I signed
the papers and that Is the end of it.
Did Not Want His Money.
â¢ "I replied." continued Miss Hodge, "that
I had never sued him for the sake of
money. That* his money was not what I
wanted. It was a vindication of my char
acter that I sought, and this the Jury
had given in its verdict. I told Mr. Nich
oll further that if he desired to end this
contest he could the expense to
which I had been put and that would end
it all. Not a dollar would I receive from
him in any other way.
â¢."â¢Jane." said Mr. Nicholl to me, *I want
to end this litigation and settle up with
you.' " So said Miss Hodge yesterday aft
ernoon.
"Within two weeks the aged defendant
decided to make a personal effort to close
the chapter of lovemaking and lawing
that had been tangled about his wooing
of bis cousin. He drove over to her resi
dence at 21 lister avenue and was for
mally received. Â«
This termination of the celebrated case
of Hodge versus Nicholl has awakened
much interest in the affairs of the two
parties who fought to the end the trial
which ended in a Jury's verdict of $25,
000 In favor of Miss Hodge. Subsequently
Judge Ogden granted a new trial of the
case upon a technicality. From that de
cision Attorneys Reed & Nusbaumer, in
behalf of Miss"Hodge, started an appeal.
Aged John Nicholl, the wealthy â¢ East
Oakland capitalist, has settled the breach
of promise suit in 'which he 'was made de
fendant by his spinster cousin. Miss Jane
Hodge. With an appeal hanging fire in
the Supreme Court, the rich landowner
and his relative yesterday compromised
the'Tltigatlon, closing the battle which
has been waging between them for nearly
three years. Miss Hodge declare* that
she has been vindicated, and that is all
the interest she has in the settlement.
The lawyers concerned, with professional
care, refuse to talk about this unexpect
ed turn in the case. The â¢plaintiff was
very willing, however, to announce that
she had settled upon a basis altogether
satisfactory to herself, namely that all of
the expense she had been under in seek
ing to have herself placed in a proper
light before her friends had been assumed
by Mr. Nicholl, and that she had not ac
cepted a dollar from her former admirer
as punitive damages.
It was. decided that there is not suffi
cient time left in which to' overcome what
they . term .. the Constitution's . "cranki
ness." .J .-.. *

at Chino has closed down, throwing: ' 400
men out of work. The beet season Is at
Its height, but Superintendent Hamilton
of the sugar factory claims that it was
forced to close by the failure of the beets
to ripen. It Is generally believed among
the beet growers at Chino that the. reduc
tion in the price of sugar has reduced
the profits in the factory to a minimum
and necessitated economy. All of the beets
are now being shipped to the factory at
Oxnard.

"If by any possibility the directors should re
fuse to act as instructed, I will call for volun
teers and will contribute my crop from a thou
sand acres of vineyard as a leader to smash
-prices. Without a strong association the raisin
market would, at once revert to Its former
wretched condition, a source of worry and loss
both to the grower and to the trade; therefore
no good can come by not fighting this question
out to a finish now."
There appears to be but one opinion In New
York uson the effect of President Kearney a
threat to make the price of raising 2 cents^ a
pound "in the sweat box. This opinion Is tnat
Kearney has demoralized the market for some
time to come. Trade here will look entirely
to the coast for guidance before taklnj hold of
the new crop. Kearney acknowledged tc your
correspondent that he had smashed the marKet.
and that to do so had been his Intention, ile
also states that he has little hope from nis
advices of the association continuing thla year.
â¢ The following dispatch has been re
ceived from M. Theodore Kearney, presi
dent of ther Raisin Growers' Association:
The following will appear to-morrow morn
ln? In the Eastern tÂ»ade papers:
"It has been teleeraDhed from Fresno that
the growers refuse to deliver a pound of rais
ins on a 2-cent basis*. There are a few pack
ers on the outside that make statement 3 and
are anxious to see the association go to pieces
so that they may secure business. But these
men are comparatively Irresponsible financially
and what they may say will have little weight
with those who know. The 'Independent pack
ers, members of. the Packers' Company, have
recently bousht some six hundred cars of old
crop and naturally they fear a less under the
present circumstances. - -
"It remains to be seen whether they will take
a broad-minded view of the case, and. by help
ing all they can to get the leases signed, save
themselves loss and put the Industry on a solid
foundation, or whether they will see only the
'Impending loss on this purchase and Join hands
with the enemy of the association. If they

twenty years, and that it waa solely a
matter of administration.
The plan to be discussed at the forth
coming convention provides for the divi
sion of the country Into seven provinces.
Each province r.ill have an Archbishop at
its head, and the! Archbishops In turn will
elect a Metropolitan, who will be the.ex
ecutive and constitutional leader of the
Episcopal church in America.
The proposed provinces will be consti
tuted as follows: t
- New England and New Yorkâ Eleven dio
ceses.
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Mary
land, District of Columbiaâ Nine dioceses. â¢
Virginia, West Virginia, j North and South
Carolina. -Georgia, Florida â Eight dioceses and
two missionary districts. .
Alabama,- Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Ok
lahoma,; Arkansas. ; Tennessee and Kentucky-
Nine dioceses and two missionary districts. ,
Ohio'.: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wiscon
sin â Twelve dioceses. y
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska
(Including: that portion of - Wyoming lylngr in
the district of Laramle),' North and South Da
kotaâSix dioceses and four missionary dis
tricts.
. Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Cali
fornia, Nevada. Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New-
Mexico and Alaskaâ Four dioceses and nine
missionary districts. .
The Archbishop, under, the new regime,
would be the tangible head in every sec
tion, but his powers, prerogatives and
duties would be, definitely set forth, both
by canon law snd by long precedent, in
the church at large, and in particular in
other : branches of the Anglican com
munion. The new plan aims to take many
ideas from the Church of England. If the
proposed plan is accepted by the conven
tion It is expected that the primate of the
whole American church .will be the ven
erable Bishop of Rhode Island, the senior
Archbishop of the church.
The convention will also discuss the
status of the Anglican church in Hawaii
and the duties of the church toward the
new American possessions. Bishop Willis
of Hawaii is expected to be present. He
was appointed by the Church of England
as Bishop of Hawaii, and since the an
nexation has remained at his post. His
supporters desire that he should remain in
Hawaii, while his opponents are anxious
that the diocese should be annexed to the
Episcopal church of the United States.
The matter is one that has caused many
heartburnings in .Hawaii among Episco
pal church members, and it is hoped' that
the subject will be amicably settled at
the convention. *
An important, matter to be settled by
the convention is that of selecting a new
name for the church. Its present title,
"The Protestant Episcopal Church of the
United States of America," is considered
by many to be unsuitpd, both inmeaning
and in length. ,In a recent issue of the
Living Churchman prominent clergy and
laity ot the church submitted their views
on the subject and also proposed names
for the one now in use. .
Expect Many Delegates to Attend.
It is expected that more than 600 dele
gates, lay and clerical, w,ill be present at
the general convention. ,
Among thosa who will journey to San
Francisco will be the Right Rev. Samuel
Cook Edsall. Bishop of North Dakota and
"diocesan-elect { to Minnesota. He is the
Grand Missionary Bishop of North Dako
ta and has achieved remarkable results in
his work in that State. He is by birth
and training a Western man. His father
was a prominent lawyer of Illinois and at
one time was Attorney General of the
State. Bishop Edsall was designed, for
the bar and studied law In his father's
office, but he abandoned the law and en
tered the church. He graduated from the
Western" Theological Seminary in 1886 and
was ordained a priest in 1889. His first
and only parisn was St. Peter's, In Chi
cago, which he founded as a mission, but
it soon expanded until it -became one of â¢
the strongest parishes in the State of Il
linois. His success as a clergyman marked
him for ecclesiastical preferment, and in
1898 the general convention appointed him
Bishop. of his present diocese.. The dio-'
cese is one of the largest in' the country:
He has built churches, schools, missions
and hospitals In every section of his vast
jurisdiction. The call to become Bishop
Coadjutor of Minnesota .was heard with
regret by the people of North Dakota,
but they realized that their beloved Bish
op was stepping upward in his calling.^ ,
Bishop Edsall ranks as one of the lead
ers of the younger generation -.of Bishops.
Accompanied by a large delegation from
North Dakota, Bishop Edsall is expected
to arrive in. San Francisco in the course

WANT EARLIER SEASON
FOR QUAIL SHOOTING
I Archdeacon' Emery explained ' yesterday
that the division of the country into pro
livinces had been. discussed- for the, past
Plan to Simplify '.Church Work.
. Another ' important question to Â¦ be de
cided at the convention is that of . divid
ing the United States into provinces and
establish over each province an Arch
bishop as the head of the church in that
section. This natter has. not been urged,
by the ritualists,' as has. been extensively!
stated in the East in the.' past few
months. â¢
Marriage is a solemn contract and should be
so considered .; when - entered ; into. 'Â¦-., The strict
letter of the marriage ceremony of our church
should be upheld and persons who marry should
realize that it is "for better. or worse, for
richer or for poorer, In sickness or in health,
until death do us part" '. (
It may be argued that the prohibition of re
marriage of divorced persons would work hard
ships in - many cases. I .do ' not agree with
those who argue that way. Prohibition of re
marriage , of divorced persons means a 'safe
guard to womanhood and the Episcopal church
is ready and , willing to place that safeguard
around women. Most divorces in this country
are due to hasty or ill-advised marriages. If
it were the universal : law that' no divorced
person could remarry during the lifetime of
the other party to the divorce It . would -have
the tendency to make parents hesitate before
giving their daughters in marriage to men
whose only qualification is the possession of
estate or money. : : -
The number of divorces In America is in
creasing and is appalling. The â¢ ease i with
which divorces are granted robe marriage of
all solemnity. I have- heard a well-educated
young woman say previous to ! her marriage
that in the event of not getting along with
her husband she could easily secure a divorce.
Frank H. Miller will submit a minority
report, providing for the remarriage of an
innocent party to a divorce granted for
infidelity.
Rev. John A. Emory, venerable arch
deacon of the diocese of California, in
speaking of tue proposed "canon, stated
yesterday" that every right thinking man
and woman would favor the . prohibition
of the remarriage of divorced persons.
He said:
That, in their opinion, no successful action
can be had in amending the constitution of the
United States so as to make uniform the law
of marriage and divorce In the United States,
but the only practicable way toward securing
such uniformity should be sought through ! the
enactment of similar lawa by thÂ© several
States. , . : .- '
With reference to the resolution re
ferred to the committee looking to an
amendment of the constitution of the
United States so as to provide for Con
gressional actipn making uniform the law
of marriage and divorce in the United
States, the committee will report as fol
lows:
TH vorces - Are on the Increase.
No minister 'shall solemnize & marriage be
tween any two persons unless nor until by In
quiry lie shall have satisfied himself that
neither person haa been or Is the husband or
the wife of any other person then living:,, un
less the former marriage was annulled by a
decree of some civil court of competent Juris
diction for cause existing before such former
marriage. ' -
No person divorced for "Cause arising after
marriage, and marrying again during the life
time of the other party to the < divorce, . shall
be admitted to baptism or confirmation or re
ceived to the holy communion, except when
penitent and separated from', the other party
to the subsequent marriage, or when peni
tent and in immediate danger of death; but
this canon shall not apply ' to the Innocent
party to a divorce for the cause of adultery.
Delegate Stetson of New York intro
duced the resolution at the last general
convention bv which' the special commit
tee was brought into existence. The pro
posed canon to be reported to the con
vention, after defining matrimony and
stating what marriages are prohibited on
the ground of Impediment of consanguin
ity, says:
The committee on marriage and divorce
that will report to the general convention
consists of Rev. Morgan Dix (chairman),
Rev. Drs. Hoffman of New York, Daven
port of Tennessee, Mann of West Mis
souri, Fulton of Pennsylvania, Eccleston
of Maryland, Messrs. Lewis of Pennsyl
vania, Stetson of New York, Miller of
Georgia, Stanley of Washington, Light
ner of Minnesota and Bradford of Dela
ware. Rev. F. Lobdell of 'Western New
York, wno died In the fall of 1899, was a
member of the committee.
The prohibition of the remarriage of
divorced persons has for some years re
ceived the careful attention of the lead
ers of the Episcopal church, and there
was but little opposition in the conven
tion of 1898 to the resolution calling for
the appointment of a special committee
to consider the question. The committee,
consisting of clergy and laity, after a
number of sessions, decided by a vote of
11 to 1 to report at the forthcoming con
vention in favor of such prohibition. At
the present time the Episcopal church
permits the remarriage of an innocent
party to a divorce obtained on the ground
of Infidelity, but the vast Increase in the
number of divorces in this country; for
many reasons has created alarm in the
minds of church leaders.
members of the general conven
tion of the Protestant Episcopal Church
of the United States that, meets in this

The proposed canon will be submitted

ff"g*Â«tiMLrÂ«V#JVOT* BSm8%0m the skin is most active and the pores well
open, we are much more liable to be affected by Poison Oak aild Ivy and other
dangerous plants. Workers in brass, copper, lead and zinc have their health, im-
paired and the blood- supply poisoned through the absorption of fine particles of
these metals and the acids used in polishing and cleaning them. Inhaling the
s fumes of lead give paintersthat pallid, waxy appearance of the skin. Barber's Itch
is another disease that reaches the blood through the skin, and is a most obstinate,
one when it becomes firmly fixed in the system. After the poison has reached the
blood and been disseminated throughout the system it is too late to resort to local
applications. In many cases the blood is affected simultaneously with the appear
ance of the rash or eruption on the skin, and all efforte should be directed to the
purification and building up of the blood. Ugly eruptions and sores'will continue
tODreak'out ill spite of salves, -washes, soaps or other external treatment.
S. S. S. is especially recommended for poisons of this character. So com-
pletely does itdestroythe effects of the Oak and Ivy that there is'no possibility of
its reappearance, and it is equally as efficacious in brass or lead poisoning or Bar-
ber's Itch ; building up and purifying the blood and driving out of the circulation
impurities of every kind, and removing every blemish, sore or eruption from the
skin. There is no substitute for S. S. S. ; it is the only, purely vegetable blood
: purifier known, and the safest and best in all constitutional or blood diseases. -

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 4.â
The registration of matriculated stu
dents closed to-night at 8:30 o'clock. A
count showed 724, as compared with 772 at
the close of the second day last year.
The difference Is explained by the fact
that the class of 1901 was the largest ever
graduated, thus diminishing the num
of matriculates. About twenty-flve, how

'Â±he City Road Chapel, where the con
ference is being held, was built by John
Wesley in 1760. It is sometimes called tho
Cathedral of Methodism and is filled witn
memorials of all denominations tracing
their origin to Wesley. Marble columns
representing Methodist branches in tho
North and tiouth of the United States and
Canada are among those holding up the
gallery. They were presented after tde
rirst conference that assembled here ex
actly twenty years ago.
The most striking feature of the confer
ence to-day was an impassioned plea of
the colored Bishop Walters of Jersey City.
He declared that there was a systematic
effort on foot on the part of the white
Americans to destroy the good opinion
which the English people had of Ameri
can negroes. He recapitulated the lynch
ing figures for the year 1900 and declared
that, though ninety negroes were lynched,
in only eleven cases had assault on white
women been proved. The Bishop's state
ments about negro morality elicited loud
cheers from the English part of the audi
ence, and several of the many Southern
delegates went out, while others did not
conceal their disagreement with the
speaker.

TALK OF PEACE TERMS.
The steel officials are in a very confident
mood to-night and appear to think the
strike is broken effectually and that only
a few days more will be required to make
it a thing of the past. The return of the
400 tube workers at McKeesport and the
report that 150 or more went in at the
Pennsylvania Tube Works, and the pro
tection of Sheriff McKinley. and his sev
enty-five deputies at Demmler, where a
start will be made to-morrow, give much
weight to this belief. In addition to these
breaks the steel officials claim increased
numbers at the Star, .the Lindsay & Mc-
Cutcheon, the Painters and the Clark
mills, and say other plants will now be
put into service rapidly.
Organizer Schwartz of the American
Federation, who organized- the Pennsyl
vania Tube "Workers, called a meeting of
his men this afternoon, at which it was
decided, that none of the men would re
turn until President . Shaffer gave the
word. â¢ . Â¦

MANILA, Sept. 4.â Lieutenant Hazzard
of the Third Infantry has brought in here
Arthur Howard, the American deserter,
who was recently captured by the lieu
tenant while in command of some Maca
bebe scouts in the island of Mindoro. He
was placed in jail, and will shortly be
court-martialed. . Â¦ Â¦
Howard denies that, he was ever an
American soldier. He claims he was born
in Spain, that his father was English and
his mother Spanish; but that he espoused
the cause of the Filipinos. In 1896, after
peace was declared, he said he went to
Hongkong and returned in 189S r.s-Aguin
aldo's chief of artillery. While in chat
position, Howard, also says, he made
friends with many Americans before the
insurrection, including' General Greene,
He cast his lot with Aguinaldo at the time
of the rupture with the Americans and
he says that ho brought in sixteen Amer
ican prisoners, under a flag ; of truce at
Augeles, in September, 1899. ..
Howard denies that he commanded the
force at San Mateo which killed General
Lawton. He speaks like an educated Eng
lishman. Lieutenant Hazzard says he,
himself, saw Howard at Angeles in 1899.
Two former California volunteers to-day
identified Howard as a deserter from
their 'regiment named Wall ey, of "â¢' Com

NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â At the Colombian
legation here to-day it was said that the
1500-pounder cannon which was suddenly
taken from the Pan-American Exposition
at Buffalo, has been shipped to Colombia
and was being placed in position at Car
tagena. It was also said that, the muni
tions of war lost on the cruiser La Popa,
scuttled by the Insurgents, was not as ex
tensive as reported. It has been asserted
that five rapid-fire guns, 1000 rifles and be
tween 500,000 and 1,000,000 cartridges went
down on the cruiser.
Consul Malmore's reports that Bocas
del Torro is more exposed to danger
than any other point in his consular dis
trict. There are 150 rebels in the vicinity
of that town, which is defended by a Gov
ernment force of seventy-five men. The
revolutionists are awaiting reinforcements
before attacking the place.
Under date of August 26 Gudger states
that the Liberals were concentrating at
Chama, twenty miles from Panama. The
Government forces were then strengthen
ing themselves in Panama. He adds that
the decision of the United States to send
warships to Panama had a very good ef
fect upon the situation
Consul General Gudger's dispatch shows
that .troublesome conditions continue to
on the Isthmus of Panama. For
tunately there has been no disturbance of
railway communications, nor is any likely
to take place in view of the instructions
given by the leaders of the Insurrection
to their armed forces. Guerrilla bands
have committed depredations upon -Chi
nese merchants along the railway. Gudger
has in the absence of the Chinese Consul
endeavored to use his good offices in their
behalf.
Mail reports. were received by the State
Department to-day from Minister Bowen
in Caracas and Consul General Gudger in
Panama and Consul Malmores in Colon.
Minister Bowen transmitted a copy of a
note addressed by the Venezuelan Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs to the foreign Min
isters in Caracas explaining the attitude
of the Venezuelan Government in the dis
pute with Colombia.
Reports From Diplomats.
The negotiations with Uribe closed, it
is authoritatively stated, with the agree
ment of surrender, but the Colombian au
thorities are now satisfied that this was a
ruse by which his agents secured pass
ports through Colombia and went on an
ostensible peace mission, whereas their
real purpose was to act as spies and revo
lutionary propagandists.
. The Colombian Government is expected
to make an emphatic rejoinder to the offi
cial statement of Venezuela that armed
invasions by Colombian troops have been
crossing the Venezuelan frontier \ and
have been forcing war upon that country.
It will show In substance that Colombian
troops on the frontier are there to pro
tect the border and that any crossing of
the line has been by detached bands with
out the approval of the Federal Govern
ment. It has just been disclosed that

An Emphatic Rejoinder.
Before his departure this morning for
Buffalo Dr. Silva. Colombian Minister,
cabled to Bogota the text of President
Castro's communication to the foreign
governments, explaining the causes for
the adoption by Venezuela of a bellicose
attitude toward Colombia. Dr. Silva
urged his Government to make a 'detailed
reply to the Venezuelan note.
At the same time administration offi
cials reiterate that if Colombia assents to
the exercise by the President of his good
offices, as she Is expected by a well in
formed Pan-American- diplomat to do,
the President and Secretary Hay will
open the matter with Venezuela and will
endeavor to induce her to permit the
United States to mediate in the interest
of peace.
Venezuela's response is regarded as a
polite rejection of the tender of American
mediation, and is accepted as establish
ing the purpose of President. Castro not
to deviate from his policy of precipitating
a foreign war so as to prevent Internal
revolt.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G ' STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Sept. 4.-Until for
mal reply is made by Colombia to the in
timayon of the United States Government
that its good offices are at her disposal
no further action will be taken by the
Washington administration".
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The President remained quietly In the
house during the evening, retiring at an
early hour. To-morrow morning at 10
o'clock he will leave Mr. Milburn's house,
accompanied by an escort of mounted po
lice and cavalry, and proceed directly to
the exposition grounds, where ceremonies
will be held in honor of the day.
President McKinley, with Mrs. McKin
ley and John G. Mllburn. president of tha
Exposition Company, entered the first
carriage. It was with difficulty that the
police kept a passage way clear for the
carriages, which proceeded slowly toward
the Lincoln Parkway entrance. Cheer
efter cheer went up from the vast throng.
The President acknowledged the saluta
tion of the crowd by bowing and raising
his hat. Mrs. McKinley, who looked re
markably well after the tiresome journey,
also smiled happilv.
The carriages stopped on the Triumphal
Bridge to give the members of the party
a moment to take in the beauties of the
grounds. They were then driven rapidly
out of the Lincoln Parkway entrance, up
the parkway to Delaware avenue, to the
house of Mr. Milburn, whose guest Mr.
\and Mrs. McKinley and the members of
their party will be during their stay in
the city.
At 6:30 o'clock the blowing of whistles
in the factories north of the exposition
grounds announced the approach of the
train. A few minutes later President Mc-
Kinley. with Mrs. McKinley leaning on
his arm, and surrounded by the reception
committee emerged from the entrance
to the Terminal station. A great cheer
went up from the thousands who caught
a glimpse of the party and it was taken
up and re-echoed by the others farther
back, who, although they could not see
the President, knew what the cheering
meant.
The screeching of whistles and the
boominer of guns greeted the President's
train as it passed along the lake and river
fronts over the belt line tracks to the
grounds. As the train flashed past Fort
Porter fired a salute of twenty-one guns.
An immense crowd had assembled at the
railway terminus at the exposition
grounds to await the arrival of the Presi
dent. From the electric tower down the
west side of the Court of Fountains, as
far as the Triumphal Bridge, people
were packed so closely together that there
Â¦was scarcely room to move.
BUFFALO. X. T.. Sept 4.â President
McKinley, in whose honor September 5
has been set aside on the Pan-American
Exposition calendar, entered Buffalo to
night through the portals of the Rainbow
City. A few of the party left the Presi
dential train at the Central station, but
the President and Mrs. McKinley, the
Misses Barber and Miss Sarah Duncan,
the President's nieces, and the members
of the reception committee were taken at
once to the north grate of the exposition
grounds.

SUMMARY:
cidlng of the final six-furlong dash. At
the start Canderos, the favorite, with
Ransch, did not break with the field and
was left. He is a four-year-old by Can
dlemas-Hulda Dwyer, from the stable of
Walter Jennings, and was a supposed
grood thing. Near the three-furlong pole
Heraldo, ridden by H. Brown, a colored
boy, fell, bringing down with him Mif
ford and Toribio. J. Brown, who piloted
Mifford, suffered a fracture of the collar
bone and the horse was so -hardly, injured
that he was destroyed. Hoar "was badly
shaken, up, but Â¦ fortunately escaped se
rious injury. The winner turned up in
Miss Vera, an 8 to. 1 shot, played down to
2hi, ridden by Howson, which wpn gallop
ing from Phlegon and Ravino.

REVIEW TROT WITH EASE
Achilles, now owned entirely by Jack
Atkin and trained by Eddie Carey, won
the Shafter stake in impressive . fashion.
He had Johnny Hoar -on his back, and
after being played : down to 2 to 5 came
from behind, beating Divina and Royalty
just as he pleased in 1:14&
For the first running affair, six fur
longs. Roundhead and Chaste closed equal
choices in the \ ring. J. Ranech had his
first mount at the meet on Roundhead
and both horses ran as if they had been
off on an alfalfa expedition. ; Claude Bur
llngame succeeded in \ getting McFarlane
away from the barrier and the old geld
ing, well handled, beat San Augustine a
length, at odds of 4.tol.- Grady ran third
after beine cut down.
The 2:18 pace was a sort of special for
a $400 purse and" proved a mere travesty.
Gaff Topsail, the favorite, gathered the
coin in straight heats, but will have a
merry old time when next he meets Rich
ard B. Â¦ . â¢â¢ .Â¦Â¦â¢:
Unfortunately for backers of Joe
Eviston, favorite for the pacing stake, the
Seympur Wilkes gelding broke down and
was- distanced in the third heat, after
having two heats to his credit. In all
three , heats the first choice .was forced
along by Pearl Sinclair, the pair practi
cally racing themselves to a standstill.
Catching them very tired in the third
heat, Osmont, driven, by H. Ward, won
easily from. Pearl, the favorite breaking
down- and catching the flag. There being
no other starters, v the mare went to the
barn under the rules for not winning a
heat in three, and . Osmont enjoyed a
walkover.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 4.â Not much
could be said favorable to the har
ness events at- Agricultural Park
this afternoon, both the three
year-old pacing stake and the
scrambled up number for 2:18 class pacers
savoring strongly of "bush" racing. The
runners plalnljN^ad the call, furnishing
geme average sport for a fair sized
crowd. Gaff Topsail captured the 2:18
pace, scoring down a hot- favorite. Achilles
annexed the' Shafter selling stake and
Goodhope downed a cheap bunch of sprin
ters, which ended the reign of first
choices.
In the forenoon there was quite an at
tendance at the park to see the relay
bicycle race. The local or Oak Park team
carried off the honors, defeating the 'boys
from Stockton and \Villows_

FLATBUSH STAKE
FOR NASTURTIUM
Â¦ â¢ " deep Interest last night at Pythian
Castje. Sixty greyhounds were entered in
pie rich stake. Last year there were nine
ty-six entries, but owing to distemper and
other ills known in dogdom the stake is
much smaller Ihis year. There are, how
ever, a fine lot of dogs, representing the
best bloodjn the State.
That this' stake Is an important one is
evidenced by the care taken in listing the
dogs and the size of the fees imposed.
The owners had to pay quite a sum for
the privilege of running. Upon listing'
their entries they had to pay $1 each.
Then there were three payments. The
first payment was $2 50, the second a like
sum and the , final fee amounted to $5,
which was handed over to Secretary
KleVesahl last night
In all the stake amounts to 52*81. The
sura, of 11500. was added by - the Union
Coursing Park management. The prizes
will be awarded as follows: Winner of
stake, $992; runner-up. 5496; next two, 5125
each; next four. $75 each; next seven, $24
each; winners of one course, ' $10 each;
breeders to receive $125. or $62 50 each.
Two other stakes will be run during the
three days' coursing. A reserve stake of
eighty entries will be run off on Saturday
and Monday. There will be a champion
stake of twenty-four entries run off on
Sunday. The feature of this stake is the
return of Sacramento Boy. This dog won
the -John Grace cup -last -year, and will
bÂ« trained in this city for . the classic
eÂ«ent. which will be. brought pff next
month.

The winners and runners up will re

their . efforts.' . ,
S Before the tournament the southern
contingent were strong favorites for first
honors, and the victory of McGavin and
Smith came as a great surprise. The
showing of the winners is made more re
markable by the fact that this is the
first time they have ever played to
gether in doubles, while all the other
teams have been in existence for several
years. : : : .
The all-comers' match In the doubles
tournament for the coast championship
was played on the courts I of the Hotel

In a victory for Drummoridf McGavin
and Grant Smith, the ' local men. The
runners up were S. Sinsabaoigh and T.
Hendricks, the Southern California ex
perts. XThe victory of McGavin and
Smith was a, well-earned one, as they de
feated the champions, ex-champions and
second best team of Southern California,
Many are of the opinion that Hendricks
and Sinsabaugh are fully as strong as
Bell and Braley, and- they certainly
played a better game than the latter in
this tournament. The score was 6â8,
6â3, 6â 2, 8â 6. Â¦" \ .
The first set went to Â¦ the losers after
some very exciting and fast rallies. . In
this set the southern men out-volleyed
their opponents, which turned the bal
ance in their favor. In the second and
third sets McGavin and Smith improved
very much in their â¢ volleying and took
the sets quite handily. Sinsabaugh did
not play as well in these sets as in
the first one, but his partner seemed to
Improve as the game progressed. Mc-
Gavin was forced to do the lion's share
of the work on the opening day, but yes
terday Smith was in much better condi
tion and bravely held jip his end. Mc-
Gavin, while hardly as brilliant as in the
match against Bell and Braley, was very
steady, and his lobbing was particularly
good. Smith won many points\ by his
swift service and volleyed fast and
strong. Sinsabaugh was probaply the
quickest man of the four at the ftiet. but
he was somewhat erratic and failed
at critical times. . Hendricks, who was
slightly handicapped by a sore knee, was
particularly strong in overhead work,
winning many aces by his swift and ac
curate smashing.
In the last set the real struggle com
menced. The losers started off well,
taking the first two games, but their op
ponents soon made it 2â2. At this stage
of the game McGavin, and Smith began
to resort to lobbing, to which their vic
tory was undoubtedly due. The losers,
at 5 â 4. were . within a point of winning
the set twice, but the steadier play of
their opponents won the day. Sinsa
baugh and Hendricks tried hard to ward
oft .defeat, but their opponents took the
next two games and set, 8â <>.

The accessions to the working force at
the UnlonV Iron Works continue dally,

developed the fact that twenty men' were

during the morning, making a total of
52 men during the week. The machinists
and other laborers who went to work
yesterday v are recent arrivals from the

The report that union machinists are

are holding out bravely and that they
will not give in until their right to a

Notwithstanding this â¢ denial . leading

Federation Delegates Arrested onSus-
picion, but Promptly Eeleased.
Frank Johnson and Gus Helmgren were
arrested yesterday by Detective Egan on
suspicion of being concerned In the steal-
Ing of a bag containing the clothes and
$640 belonging to a sailor named David
Linden, who with another member of the
crew of the bark Highland Light was
forced to leave that vessel by union pick
ets last Thursday morning. The prisoners
were released by order of Captain Sey
mour last night, as David Linden, the
sailor who claimed he had been robbed,
failed to put in an appearnce, notwith
standing thfltt he had told Captain Sey
mour that he would appear and swear to
a complaint.
Linden had been hanging around the
Hall of Justice for several days prior to
the arrest of. the men. and his disappear
ance when he :iad an opportunity to press
the case against the members of the un
ion is looked upon with suspicion by the
police.
The men who left the vessel last Thurs
day passed their bags over the side of the
ship to the union pickets,* who patrol the
bay in a small boat. Linden claims that
he was taken from the Sailors' Union hall
and beaten/ and that the officials there
kept his bag, containing his clothes . and
money. .
Johnson and Helmgren are prominent
members of the Sailors' Union. They are
both delegates to the City Front Federa
tion and are known as strong union men.
When the matter was reported to Cap
tain Dunleavy, Andrew Furuseth, secre
tary of the Sailors' Union, was sum
moned and questioned concerning the al
leged robbery. Furuseth denied having
any knowledge of Linden or his bag. Cor
poral Egan was . detailed on the case,
and after making an investigation picked
out Johnson and Helmgren as the guilty
men. There was little evidence to show
that the two prominent union men had a
hand in the robbery, and when Linden
failed, to appear to identify them Captain
Sevmour issued, the order giving them
their freedom. . .

Stones With Bullet
Non-Union Man Answers Volley of
A non-union teamster in the employ of
McNab & Smith fired a shot in the direc
tion of a crowd of strikers yesterday aft
ernoon at the corner of Sixth and Bran
nan streets. The teamster, who was ac
companied by a special policeman, was
driving an empty truck to McNab &
Smith's wool shed on Brannan street,
near Townsend. Just as he was turning
the corner of Sixth and Brannan streets
a crowd of about a dozen strikers com
menced to hurl stones at him. The teams
ter immediately drew his gun and fired.
The shot was evidently meant only to
frighten^the men, as the bullet found
lodgment in the - sidewalk close to- the
truck. The crowd immediately dispersed.
The special officer took no part In the af
fair. â¢ -- â¢
The teamster who did the Bhootlng, ac
cording to the strikers' story, has been
making himself especially obnoxious.
They state that he has worn a revolver
in a most threatening and offensive man
ner and that when he first went to work
for McNab & Smith he refused the.pro
tection of an officer, claiming that ha
could protect himself. This boast aroused
the resentment of the strikers and it Is

The following communication from a
merchant of Salinas has been received,
with the accompanying: proposal of con
certed action on the part of the farmers
of the State in the attempt to market
their crops: > .
SALINAS CITY, Cal.. Sept. A. 1301.
Editor Call, San Francisco, CaLâ Dear Sir:
Believing that prompt, concerted action on the
part of the country, people Is all that will

the plans for the revival of our industries.
Yours for action, C. A. DAYTON.
To my countrymen: The time Is very short
now. in which to move the products of the
country before the setting In of the winter
rains. If they are not moved at once the low
â¢will be greater than we would sutler by the
total failure of crops. The time has come for
action. The crops cannot .be moved for the
reason that men are not given protection in
the unloading and loading of vessels. It is
not for us to inquire at this late day which
side Is right In the strike controversy. We
cannot afford to allow bodies of men to ruin
us while they ruin themselves. If they will
not handle our crops they must allow us to
do so. Me must furnish men and protection
to handle these crops, and It must be done
at once. Another month and it will be too
If you all feel as I do we can have our
crops moving in good shape inside of ten days.
Shall wo move them? An executive committee
consistlr.s: of one farmer of note from each
county In the State is needed to proceed at
once to San Francisco to manage our affairs
until our products are moved: the namei of
ten thousand good, able-bodied men that can
be available to the call of the executive
committee to handle our products; the names
of twenty-flve thousand men that are willing
to answer the call of the commutes to protect
the men that are handling: our products, and
th.p names of all persons that are wllllne to
assist in any way whatever . in putting this
season's crops upon the market. Don't con
elder yourself too little or insignificant to
answer this call. Your dally bread is Just as
Important to you as mine is to me. " Send In
your name to-day and state what you can do
to assist as a laborer, guard or with donations
to the executive committee to defray any
necessary expenses, and also give the name of
some trusty farmer in your county that you
would like to have act as your representative
on the executive committee, and if you act
promptly we will be saved from the immense
loss that now threatens us. Address

TEAMSTER FIRES AT CROWD.
OAKLAND, Sept. 4.â William Osborne,
C. F. Bradley, F. Sprinkle, Edward Mc-
Feeley and G. F. Gould, union teamsters,
who were on strike, have returned to
work with the Merchants' Express Com
pany, each man having oecome a stock

that move the Brotherhood of Teamsters
has. boycotted the company.
The Building Trades Council has re
ferred to its executive committee for a
report Tuesday evening the matter of per
mitting union longshoremen and team
sters to handle lumber and coal dis
charged by non-union crews at Oakland
docks and yards. For ten days, under a
special agreement with the -employers,
this situation has obtained. The council
held a lengthy session last evening,
but reached no decision, leaving final ac
tion in the hands of the executive com
mittee. There is a strong disposition on
the part of the council to continue as at
present in order thsft contractors might
not be hampered for supplies, and .that
union mechanics be not laid off because
supplies are not to be had at the yards.
Settlement of the questions involved in
the planing mills' agreement as to union
izing of the mills has been placed in' the
hands of a special committee of the
Building Trades Council , composed of H.
E Hahn, R.~ Willeke, D. Anker and E.
Barbeau. The Mill Owners' Association's
committee is composed of A. Kendall, C.
L. Ingler and E. C Bridgeman. There
will be no trouble, as the compromise
signed six months ago that terminated
the mill operatives' strike â¢ contains all
necessary provisions to meet the situa
tion.
In a number of mills union and non
union men are working together. The
mill owners claim that the Building
Trades Council has permitted its mem
bers to handle material from non-union
shops and has not afforded the agreement
signers full protection.
The entire subject will be placed before
President McCarthy of the San Francisco
Building Trades Council. <**

INTERRED BY THE MASONS,
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger paid a beauti
ful tribute to the memory of the late Dr.
Gustavus Schiff, whose funeral was held
yesterday. The pastor of Temple Emanu-
El and the physician were warm personal
friends, and when the former spoke beside
the bier his heart was full of love and
sorrow for the departed.
The relatives and friends who crowded
the late residence of Dr. Schiff at 1S20
line street were moved to tears by Dr.
Voorsanger's words. The speaker told of
the warm bond of friendship that had ex
isted between the physician and himself.
He said It dated far back to the time
when the speaker was in Texas. He told
of the good deeds done by the deceased,
dwelt on hie charity and goodness and
praised him for his kindly acts to the
poor. Racol Voorsanger said the doctor
was born for humanity and the work im
posed upon him by the Omnipotent had

performed by Dr. Schiff during the Civil
\var,Â« when as assistant surgeon he
worked incessantly among the wounded
In Isashville. Tenn. He dwelt at length
on the sacrifices deceased made for hu
manity. He said that during the cholera
epidemics of 1866 he boldly entered upon
the work of alleviating the sufferings of
the afflicted, and was spared to continue
his noble work. In 1873, he said, Dr. Schiff
once more entered the field to relieve the
Bufferings of the cholera stricken people
end passed through the epidemic un
ecathed.
The rabbi traced his history down to the
day of his death, and said that the life of
the deceased was full of acts of heroism,
charity and noble deeds.
An entire room was filled with floral
tributes from physicians, patients and
friends of the deceased. There were six
ty-two set pieces, that ranged from a va
cant chair to a pillow.
The pallbearers were Rudolph Sampson,
"Wallace A. WlsÂ«. Morris Miteau, Henry
Frohman, Samuel Sternheim and Isidor
X*vy.
x ue remains were taken to Odd Fellows'
Cemetery and cremated. This was the ex
pressed wish of deceased, and his family

Attorney E. Myron "Wolf of this city

Union Pickets Found in Crew, of the
Steamer Rainier.
Despite the efforts of the union pickets
to prevent the steamer Rainier getting
out of the harbor with a non-union crew
that vessel cleared yesterday afternoon
with every berth filled. She would have
sailed on time but for the fact that two
of the men shipped were found to be un
ion men placed aboard the ship to entice
the non-union men ashore. When the
two men were discovered they were or
dered off the vessel and the departure of
the steamer was delayed until two men
could be secured - to replace them. D.
Aylevich, one of the union pickets sent
abcard the Rainier, was arrested by Offi
cer Bean for refusing to obey the- cap
tain's order to leave the ship -and a
charge of drunkenness was placed against
him.
The Walla Walla sailed on time quite
heavily laden with freight. The other ves
sels that sailed were the Point Arena, San

James Lantry was arrested near the
docks of the Oregon Railway and Navi

Officers Mullender and Mackey and
charged at the Harbor Station with bat
tery. Lantry, with a number of others,
assaulted Dennis Bowan on Spear street
yesterday morning as he was on his way
to work. Officer Mullender witnessed the
assault and ran toward the struggling
crowd. The men who were beating Bowan
broke and ran as the officers neared them

a N effort is being made to bring
i\ about a conference at 10 o'clock
ZA\ this morning at the Palace Hotel
A. jX between the Conciliation Com
mittee of the Board of Super
visors, the officers of the Draymen's As-
Bcrciation and a committee from the Em
ployers' Association. If the meeting is
not held at that hour It will very prob
ably be held some time durine the after
noon or evening.
The conciliation committee has had sev
eral conferences with the labor leaders
and while its members are pledged to
secrecy they do not hesitate to say. that
the prospect of attaining results is good
and that they have hope of being able
to report within a short time some defin
ite plan of direct conference or settlement
by other means that will meet with the
approval of both parties to the labor con
troversy.
Charles L. Tilden. president, and George
Renner, manager, will probably represent
the Draymen's Association if the meet
ing be held. The Draymen's Association
approved at its regular meeting last night
the course of the executive committee and
continued the power of the committee to
act for the association in any negotiations
looking to the settlement of the strike.
This action is regarded as having direct
bearing upon the proposed conference to
day.
The Employers' Association has not lent
encouragement to the various efforts at
conciliation that have been undertaken,
and if it send a committee to the confer
ence this morning the significance will be
great, i The official character of the Su
pervisors' committee vests the approach
ing conference with an importance which
would not attach to a meeting with a like
committee from a private or quasi-public
organization. The fact that the Employ
ers' Association recognizes the committee
to the extent that It is willing to confer
with it relative to the strike and the best
means for bringing about peace will ap
pear to many to be a happy augury o: an
early settlement of the dispute. What the
committee of Supervisors has up its sleeve
no one knows, as its operations thus far
have been kept a close secret, but it Is
known that it now enjoys the confidence
of both sides to the controversy. .
M. F. Michael, attorney for the Employ
ers' Association, was out of the city last
night and could not be reached. Frank J.
Symmes did rot know of the proposed
conference and could not say who would
compose the committee if one were sent.
Members of the conciliation committee
fell back upon their pledge of secrecy
and refused to divulge the details of the
proposed conference. ,--
The second meeting of the Draymen s
Association since the strike of the team
sters was inaugurated six -weeks ago was
held at the Alcazar last night. About 100
draymen were in attendance and Presi
dent C. L. Tilaen occupied the chair.
Though it was not announced, the pur
pose of the meeting is understood to have
related to the conterence of to-day. â¢ ;
Manager George Renner reported the re
sult of the conference with the teamsters
last week, which was the withdrawal of
the offer made by the executive.commit
tee of the association to the teamsters be
cause of its rejection by the representa
tives of the brotherhood. The report ex
cited considerable discussion. A few
draymen stated that they were Buffering
hardship in consequence of the strike and
they urged an early settlement of the dis
pute. The sentiment of the majority was
in favor of allowing the executive com
mittee of five to act in the premises as it
saw fit. .

trio is a pleasing novelty. The Five Sun
beams, talkative Miss Norton, Lucille
Saunders, Mile.- Lotty, Powell, the magi
cian, and the Cragg family "of acrobats,
In their last week, complete the show.
George W. Leslie, a San Francisco favor
ite, will open wi,th his company of come
dians on Sunday.
â¢ * â¢
There is a, good old timer - playing at
the Grand Opera-house this week, "Rose
dale," with - Joseph Haworth as Elliott
Grey. The appearance of Mr. Haworth
is notable In that he is regarded as the
only living successor of Edwin Booth in
the line of legitimate tragedy. The actor
has practically no opportunity for the ex
ercise of his particular gifts in "Rose
dale," but makes, nevertheless, a satisfy
ing figure of Elliott: Grey. Next week
"Quo Vadis" will be put on, and Mr. Ha
worth will Â¦ have a worthy part as Vini
clus.
Miss Florence Roberts will revive an
other Shakespearean play during'the com
ing .week; -"The Taming' of the-ShreW,
in which she will appear as Katherine and
White Whittlesey as Petruchlo. Mean
time "Ingomar" is proving a popular bill
and fllllng-'tho house comfortably at every
performance. j - . '
The Tivoli has an attractive bill this
week with "Norma,". the seldom heard,
and the -favorite "Mignon."' Barbareschi
is doing excellent work as the .priestess
in the former opera and Collamarini does
herself ample credit in the title role of
Thomas' pretty . opera. â¢-The men are
equally well crovlded for this week in
their rolesâ Russo as Wllhelm Meister,
Castellano as Pollio, Dado as the high
priest and Nlcolini as Lothario. Next
week comes "Carmen," with Collamarini
at her very best. This bill has been more
persistently redemanded than any other
in the Tivoli repertoire, and will certainly
be most popular. The alternating bill,
"Faust," will be effective contrast, and
will show Agostini as Faust, Montanart
as Marguerite and Dado as Menstofele.
The repertoire for the' good-by week of
the Nelll Company at the California has
undergone a j change from . the one â¢ pre
viously announced. "Barbara Frietchle"
will be given on Sunday night, at a spe
cial 25 and 50 cent matinee on . Monday
afternoon (Admission day), and for a final
time on Monday night. The -first produc
tion here by the Neills of Dion Bouci
cault's famous racing play, "The Jilt,"
will be given on Tuesday night and again
at the "bargain matinee", on Thursday
afternoon. â¢ An . interesting- coincidence
concerning this famous play has Just been
discovered. Fifteen years ago Bouclcault
gave the first production in the world of
this play here upon the stage of the old
California Theater. Wednesday night "A
Bachelor's Romance" will be given. On
Thursday night "The Royal Box" will be
the offering and on Friday night "The
Lottery of Love" will be given as the
good-by performance.
> Quite the best thing that has come to
town from every standpoint and for many
moons is Charles Frohman's production
of "A Royal Family,"; now. running at the
Columbia. Annie Russell as ths star of
the organization, the pretty princess who
has read "Romeo and Juliet" to good pur
pose, wishing to marry the Prince Charm
ing of her own choice, has won all hearts.
The -supporting company Is, without ex
ception, excellent, including as it does
Mrs. Gilbert in a wonderful performance
of the Queen Dowager's part, a richly hu
man and technically marvelous portrait
of the Cardinal by W. H. Thompson, a
polished and^ ' humorous . picture of ,. the
King of Arcaciaby;Laurence d'Orsay, and
a most convincing lover at the hands of
Orrin Johnson. It is playing to' the house's
capacity at every performance. '
The new Biblical spectacle at the Cen
tral Theater, "A Voice From the Wilder
ness," is undergoing rapid revision, with
the result of a marked Improvement at
every performance. The production has
aroused the widest j Interest ' and the at
traction promises to fill the house indefi
nitely. Nothing ao important has ever
been done . here before .from a scenic
standpoint and as a spectacle â¢ it bears
comparison with the best Eastern work.
With further rehearsal the piece is also
going much more smoothly and the play
ers are finding their places in the picture.
There is only praise heard on every hand
for the splendid enterprise of the man
agement. :

The Arctic terminus of the canal is to be,at Alex
androvsk, a port which has been recently constructed
at Kola Bay, on the Marman coast. It is said the
Russian authorities have found the port to be almost
free from ice, and that they have constructed" there a
safe harbor for the largest war vessels, with ample'
accommodations for a considerable fleet. The ter
minus'of the' canal in the White Sea will be at
Sorozkaja. By the routes of the canal the distance,
from'St. Petersburg to Sorozkaja will be'very nearly
600 miles; and to Alexandrovsk 1090 miles, while the;
present route around the Scandinavian peninsula is
2870. â¢ . V
It is estimated the cost of the canal will not be
great when the length of the route and the advantages
to be gained are taken into consideration. -Between.
St. Petersburg and Sorozkaja the route will traverse
rivers and lakes for almost the whole distance, so :
that little will have to be done on that part of the
line further tha^ to deepen and regulate the natural
waterways. The -remainder of the route will also
be easy of construction, for the surveys have disclosed'
the fact that at a former age there was a natural,
waterway connecting the northern end of the Baltic
with the Arctic, and a belt of shallow lakes situated
among low hills still marks its former course. - .
The strategic value of the route in qase of a war
with" Germany or Great Britain will be great, for at
present either., of those powers could virtually cork
Russia up in the Baltic and : prevent her fleets from*,
operating: on the ocean. When the canal has been
opened a 'different situation will present itself.- Rus
sia will have two avenues to the ocean, and it is not
likely both could.be closed against her. â>
It does not appear that the Russians expect much Â¦
of the canal, in the way of commercial advantage,' but
of course something. will be; gained in, that" direction
al so. f It will be seen "that the great inland empire is
rapidly making its way to : the -seas. - It has now" an

to the Arctic has been opened there will remain";' but

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
According to the latest reports Kitchener has a
force of something like 200,000 men, of whom up
ward of 50,000 are organized as mounted infantry.
These carefully selected horsemen are divided into
three main columns and are supposed to be in vig
orous pursuit of the Boers at all times. On the other
hand, British authorities estimate the total number of
armed Boers in the field at not exceeding 17,000. It
is'with such odds against him that Dewet has issued
his ultimatum of defiance. Such being the case, if
the report of his threac to kill every British soldier
taken in Orange River Colony be true, it will hardly
be regarded without sympathy. It is not the procla
mation of a commander of a great army threatening
with death all who resist him, but that of the heroic
leader of a small band of patriots meeting the threat
-of his powerful foe with an eagle scream of defiance
unto death.
Such a struggle among men above the. grade of bar
barians is appalling. It was with the hope of putting
an end to it that Kitchener issued his famous procla
mation warning the Boer leaders to surrender be
fore September 15 under a penalty- of exile for life
when captured. The proclamation was responded to
at the time by letters from Dewet and others re
asserting their oft declared intention of fighting so
long as they were able to carry arms, and now comes
the report of the further declaration that since they
have no way of guarding prisoners they will take
none. Should the report prove to be true and the
, evidence be forthcoming that the Boers" do indeed
intend to make it a war of extermination against their
invaders, the process of staggering humanity will
have been brought to a fearful consummation.
Whether the report of the proclamation be true or
not, it is evident the struggle in South Africa has
reached the stage that "staggers humanity." It is no
longer a campaign of armed and disciplined combat
ants fighting according to the established rules of
civilized warfare, but a struggle which appears to have
for its object something like the extermination of one
side or the other. The British troops have raided
and harried the country until it has become but little
more than a desert. Women and children have been
carried from their homes and herded into camps,
while farmhouses and barns have been looted and
burned. On the other side the British have reported
several instances where their wounded taken prison
er by the Boers have been shot.
DISPATCHES from Capetown arc to the
effect that General Dewet has issued a procla
mation declaring he will shoot all British
troops found in Orange River Colony after Septem
ber 15. It is not likely that the dispatch is strictly
accurate, but it is quite reasonable to suppose the
Boer leader has deemed it proper to meet Lord
Kitchener's proclamation with a counter proclama
tion of his own, "and to manifest to the world his de
fiant determination to fight the war for liberty so long
as life remains with him. .

T T TlTH the coming of cooler weather in the
yy East Washington correspondents - have
y.\ dropped their "silly season" discussions of
Presidential booms and are now gathering informa
tion concerning the business to be undertaken at the
next session of Congress. ' A great deal' of legisla
tion is under consideration, and as usual, our states-'
men will have plenty of work before them when they
meet. Many important measures remain from the
last session, and in addition there are several new is
suesjo be dealt with. Â£ -
It is expected the House will'- organize with.un
usual promptness and get ready for -business before
the holidays. ' Speaker Henderson,- it is said, has been,
assured of his re-election and will Return to' Washing-!
ton early and set to work assigning the committees of
the House,* so that there will be no* delay, on that
score. It is believed there will be no important
changes in the committees, and consequently, as soon
as the House organizes all will, be ready to enter at
once upon the active work of legislation.
The Washington correspondent of. the New -York
Tribune states that men at the capital who are
familiar with jj public affairs \ are of the opinion that
the coming Congress will deal with a greater volume
of business at its first session; than any of its pre-
decessors for twenty-five years.' Among the more im
portant matters that demand attention are the
problems of insular government, the application of
American law to cur new. possessions, the ; re
enactment of^the Chinese exclusion law, additional
immigration legislation, restriction of representation
in the Southern States which adopt constitutional
amendments depriving the colored race of suffrage^
the lengthening of the Congressional and Presiden
tial terms by a few weeks to enable the
of President and Vice President to occur in clement
weather, and to provide for the assembling of Con
gress earlier after its election.
In addition to those measures, which are essentially
new, there will be the merchant marine bill, the Ni<>
aragua canal bill and the pure food bill, which have
now been under consideration for a long time.
Doubtless also something will be attempted in the
way of providing"; for irrigation of arid lands, the
preservation of pastures and of forests on the national
domain, and possibly an effort will be. made in the.
direction of revising the tariff in some particulars.
Secretary Root, it is said,' will recommend legisla
tion for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of
the National Guard and Tendering it more service-'
able to the Federal Government in time of war or in
any emergency requiring; the prompt co-operation of
the guard with the regular army. Secretary Long
desires legislation of n similar" kind affecting the State
Naval Reserve, and it is;said he'will recommend that
the reserve shall be composed of men who on occa
sions may be transferred to the navy and perform
all the duties that are required of officers and men on
ships of the line. _ . Â¦'/ '
Of course not all of the legislation now discussed"
will be 'enacted,, but it, is believed that much in the
way of beneficial work will be accomplished. The
forecast is that not only will Congress organize
promptly and' get to work in Decemb'er, but that it
will not adjourn until late in the summer.
TALK AT THE CAPITAL.
Previous to Mrs. Dean leaving Manila
she had a talk with the Commissioners
there and they told her, she says, that no
more women teachers would be allowed
to come. "The women," said Mrs. Dean,'
."have absolutely no idea of the awful
hardships they will have t<r face In that
new land. .They are sent off into the In
terior far from all military protection
and in places where it is absolutely dan
! gerous for a woman to be! alone. They
never see any of the luxuries of life and
positively suffer for many of the necessi
ties. Milk and butter are unheard of, and
letters from home are many months be
tween." Â¦. . .. ,
Mrs. Dean's descriptions of the social
life of Manila are most Â¦ ali uring. There
is a continual round of gayety there, and
brave mqn and fair women make a circle
that any\ metropolitan * city might be
proud of.
Mrs. Dean declares that the foreign ele
ment in Manila is America's worst enemy
there. In this foreign element the lady
ranks the English first, the Spanish sec
ond and the Germans third. She also con
tends that they encourage the insurgents
and look with favorable eyes on all dis
turbances calculated to disturb the peace
of the nation, for war means to them
profit. \ , ' â¢ : i
"Wherever civil government ha* re
placed military government," said the tal
ented writer, . "disastrous results ; have

was shed, and only the presence of the
military | could restore peace and jj order.
Batangas," Cebu and Bohoe reveled for a
while in the uncertain conditions of civil
government, but are' now again under the

According to this lady, who has studied
and . observed, it is going to take a full
half-century crammed to the full with
American brain, American perseverance
and American tact to civilize and edu
cate the new people who are going to find
protection where the stars and stripes
wave. And It is not going: to be accom
plished under the soothing Influence of
civil government., Military government,
according to.Mrs. Dean, : is the only mode
of government for the Filipinos.
Mrs. Dean made a five months' stay in
Manila. During that time she made a
close study of. the people and the condi
tion, of 'affairs there, and while greatly
impressed wUh'our new possessions and
keenly alive to "the wondrous possibilities
of- the ! islands . she is not enthusiastic
about the Philippines as an American
country for American people. ; ** i

read and are said to have exerted a tre

We have not at disposal in one issue the space. to
give even brief mention to all the like expressions of
the country press. With them is an undertone that
bodes no good to the plans of the designing leaders
and evil advisers of union labor, who have taken from
it the last vestige of sympathy and respect among the
country people. If that labor find itself deserted by.
a powerful class of allies, whom it has hurt as if. they
were its bitterest enemies, let it r remember that The
Call warned it in time^to have avoided what will fol v
low.
The Livermore Herald says great damage has been
caused to the farmers by the strike, and worse will
come.
The Stockton Independent accuses the Examiner
of inciting riot. The â¢Bakersfield Californian ~ ac
cuses the Examiner 1 of preventing a settlement and
injuring the whole State. * ' Â»
The Calaveras Prospect denounces the sinister and
disorderly course of the Examiner. The San Ber
nardino Times-Index says: "San Francisco is dis
gracing herself with the scenes of violence permitted
in connection with the strike. If the law-abiding 1 ele
ment predominate there it would, better keep order;
if that element do not -predominate it is a good, place
to stay away from.",
The Santa Barbara Press commends the boldness
and truthfulness of The Call, and says: "The city
and country have suffered greatly already from the
effects of business stagnation, but this is not the worst
feature. Business is being restored at great cost in
protecting workingmen."
The Marysville Appeal declares that: "If the grain
growers will call a meeting at Sacramento, each mem
ber to bring. his gun, enough volunteers can be had
in fifteen minutes to raise the Port Costa blockade
in another fifteen minutes after they reach the ground.
The warehousemen will be only too glad to furnish
subsistence v and there are enough ex-soldiers. among'
the farmers to properly officer and direct the move
ment. The entire proceeding can be administered at
a cost inconsiderable as compared with the cost of
housing the grain now on the river banks.''^
The Los Angeles Times says: "Of course the Ex
aminer, is merely seeking nickels, and as a matter of
fact and finance is employing numbers of strikers "to
solicit subscriptions among their fellows by pleading
that the Examiner is supporting them and must be
itself supported."
The Livermore Echo severely reprehends the Ex
aminer's e'neouragement of .lawlessness and its agency
in the distress of the farmers by the ruin of their
crops.
The Winters Express says: "It is a pleasure to
find one San Francisco paper taking^ a stand for the
right, irrespective of the counting-room or the fear
of boycott. The Call puts the situation* rorcefully,
plainly, temperately and honestly. In contrast with
the intemperate utterances of the Examiner, the
daily misrepresentation and abuse heaped upon the
good name and best interests of the State by that
journal, The Call's sersible utterances are like a
beacon light to a storm-tossed ship."
The Napa Register says that in view of the riots
and assaults by strikers Jhe Examiner will protest in
vain against more adequate police protection.
The Alameda Argus says: . "We are somewhat sur
prised that The Call discusses the strike in such ex
cellent temper. ; Its owne'r is a large employer of
labor and has always conceded labor's demands. But
the strikes have particularly hit him, though he is in
no way at fault. That he can suffer the loss and an
noyance without resentment proves that he is more
even tempered than most men."
The Santa Cruz Sentinel approves- the attitude of
The Call. The Record-Union says the Examiner has
ceased to be a newspaper and prints .only such mat
ter as suits its designs, to carry out its purpose, and
that it is preventing a settlement of the strike by" its
evil course, and "is a curse to the city in which it is
published." *
The Tulare Register says: "The strike -is based on
the proposition that all labor must be unionized, and
if men will not join the unions and surrender their
personal liberty by persuasion they must do it by
compulsion â must be starved to it. This contention
is not just and public sentiment is not bound by it.
There is but. one thing for farmers to do and that is
to take their men and go to Port Costa and load
their grain themselves. If strikers keep their distance
no one will be hurt. It is probable that an appeal
should first be made to the Governor for militia to
be sent to Port Costa to protect the lives' and prop
erty of the farmers and warehousemen, and if the
Governor does not order the militia the farmers will
be justified in taking their Winchesters along and
throwing out a picket line to keep the strikers at bay
until the work is completed and every ship in port
is loaded and sent on its way." Â¦
With only 'occasional and unimportant exceptions
the country press is clear in its conception of the re
sponsibility for. the waste of a year's crop by^ the
strike. The statements of the strike leaders and the
Examiner are denied and denounced. The sympathy
asked for by the several "appeals" bf-the strikers 'is
refused, and every florid statement and claim put for
ward to excuse their active agency in the injury of the
farmers is punctured by counter statement of the
cold facts.
THE^country press of California is very out
spoken on the subject of ,the strike. " The coun-;
try editor is an independent man/intelligent, an
observer of the rural conditions around him/ and a
true interpreter of the public opinion of the ranch
ers and country. business men. -

John Ross died In 1898," leaving a will In
which -he bequeathed the bulk of his es
tate to two daughters, Meta F. Frear
and Mary E. Hallett. Two sons, Joseph
LÂ» and John M. Ross, were cut off with
$10 each.- John M. Ross went away to sea
twenty years ago and has not been heard
from since. Joseph L. Ross, father of
Ethel Ross, the contestant, likewise dis
appeared ten years ago. His wife, mother
oÂ£- Ethel, long mourned him as dead' and
finally, after seven years had elapsed
and he had not returned, the law pre
sumed him dead and Mrs. Ross married
again, her name now being Sophie Jen
sen, i Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦
"When the . will of John Ross was pre
sented for probate a contest on- behalf of
his grandaughter, Ethel, was filed by At
torney I. I. Brown. It was pleaded in her
behalf that at the time John Ross made
the will, disinheriting his son, Joseph L.
Ross, this son was already dead in the eye
of the law. ThereforeHhe bequest of 510
in favor of the son lapsed and his daugh
ter became an heir-at-law of her de
ceased grandfather. The law of this State
permits a testator to disinherit his heirs,
but when the testator neglects to make
mention of an heir, the omission is con
strued' as 'accidental and the omitted
party , occupies the status of a preter
mitted heir. ' -
One-third of the 5100,000 estate left by
the late John Ross is now In the hands of
his granddaughter, Ethel Ross, aged 14
years. Judge Coffey signed the decree or
dering the distribution of the estate yes
terday morning, thereby closing a con
test of unusual interest. .

which she has been built to replace. She
is 178 feet long, 36 feet 6 Inches beam and
12 feet 6 inches deep. She will use oil for
fuel, and in consequence two tanks have

Shipments of wool for the week ending Sep

decrease of 1,488,886 pounds over the shipments
of 6,597,639 pounds for the previous week. Since
January "1 the total shipments amount to 172,-
S20, 419 pounds.'
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
3,965,000 pounds domestic and 675,000. pounds for
eign, making a total of 4,640,000 pounds, against
a total of 4,350,000 for the previous week.
The total receipts since January 1 have been
470,624 bales domestic and 102,584 bales foreign.
The receipts of wool in Boston this week
amounted . to 15,765 bales, against 24,347 bales
last week.'
It has been a broken week In the wool mar
ket, owing to the intervention of a holiday.
Nevertheless a good steady inquiry for wool has
prevailed and the tone of . the market has re
mained firm. The week's -â¢ business has not
been characterized by the selling of many large
lines. of woolâ most of the purchasing having
been done by the medium or smaller sized mills,
which have, taken fair average sized lots, most
ly at good prices. \ The consumption of wool is
unquestionably larger than It has been for some
time and the wool u trade feel that there is go
ing to be an outlet for practically all the wool
which is now on hand; that the desirable Ter
ritorial clips, as well as those of the Missisippl,
will be wanted, and that a good steady going
business may be looked for.-

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall advices from New York say
In view of the generally chaotic condition of
aiairs in tfae two big dried fruit associations
an the coast the local trade is disposed to take
very little interest in future California prod
ucts of any description. Matters, instead of
crowing better, have been steadily getting
worse, until now the trouble between the
packers and the Cured Fruit Association has
reached the point of open rupture, while the
president of the Raisin Association is making
threats of a possible 2c price on new three
crown raisins in order to whip reluctant grow
ers into signing new association contracts.
Until the atmosphere clears perceptibly and it
U more or less definitely settled whether the
two associations will be able to control their
respective crops, local buyers axe not likely to
take held to any extent of Â«ither prunes or
r&is:xis. Other fruits are neglected also. New
crop yeaches are easier and apricots are very
t\o\v, commission houses reporting less de
rcand for 'cots than has been known in years
at th's season.
Raisins continue firm here and are in very
fair demand. Sales of small lots of seedless
muscatel are reported at 6\c. Car lots offer
tt W&B. Loose are scarce. Some further sales
of two-crown are reported at 5c, f. o. b. coast.
Bids of 4%c for new two-crown, 6c for three
rrown &nd o%c for four-crown were eent to
(he coast for a number of cars, but' had not
oeen confirmed at the time this was written.
Buyers, however, are looking for low prices,
particularly as it is said raisin growers are
aot signing association contracts. New Valen
rta raisins continue to Bill freely to arrive at
tc. Currants are steady on spot and selling
in a small way. New currants are reported
telling well at ISs 6d for first shipment per the
Uinnin and 17s Gd for shipment latter half of
September.
evaporated apples hold their own fairly well,
fales of two cars of prime were reported at
Wic. There were rumored sales of new prime
tt Â»%c. roods being freely offered at 10c

The stock market to-day shadowed Franco-
Turkish politics at New York's overnight sell
ing. Consols touched 93 3-16c on the report of
the year's gold exports. American stocks were
idle, but firm, until afternoon, when New
York selling caused a general relapse. Mis
souri Pacific was exceptionally steady on some
unexplained tip. There was a sudden all
round rally in the street of about a full point.
This was taken to mean that the New York
money market was easing. The close was ac

The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says:
"There has been an abnormal condition of
die lumber trade all through the month owing
to the i-revalerce of the local strike. The par
tlysis of the commercial and industrial circles
if the State through the labor disturbances
sas reacted, as troubles always do. upon the
A^iuber manufacturing and selling interests,
ind the result has been that trade, which
promised to be so good some weeks ago, is far
Â»elow the average of the month of August in
past years.
"At a. period about three weeks after the
â¢tevedcres along the water front went out in
tysipathy with the striking teamsters, there
*ere in the neighborhood of thirty million
leet of manufactured lumber from the coast
redwood mill3 and those pine plants of th-s
Pacific Northwest which ship into this mar
cet. This represented thousands of dollars for
:he lumber manufacturers, retailers and job
sers, and the stringency in the lumber ranks
aas been 6tronsly felt. However, this unfa
rorable situation is beln~ eliminated, and the
â¢rospects point toward a resumption of busi
sess throughout the lumber zone.
"This has been brought about through the
jlevcr scheming of certain lumbe- merchants,
rho have devised the plan of anchoring one
>f the unused steamers lying idle in Oakland
Creek and using it. for what is practically a
jon-union cookhouse. Here the group of work
trs along the front who ere utilized in unload
r.p lumber vessels are housed and fed and so
receive the protection that they crave. This
excellent and wise policy has secured for the
jimbermen the best of assistance and the work
if relieving the lumber congestion in the local
Kcrket is well nigh at an end.
"Prices have not been altered and there is
Â«o prospect of any such immediate action ow
zig to the Industrial conditions now In force
throughout the State. No one is in a position
:o stand any such advance in quotations and
3nÂ« old price lists will remain In vegue. Lum
frer is roming into this port in large quanti
ses, and with the lack of help removed there
n'lll be tvery reason to believe that the lumber
aianufacturers will eee the most palmy of
lays."

Cotton and Corn.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says
"The outlook for the stock market is some
chat perplexing. It is certalaly not bo favor
ible as a year ago. We are up against a
:rop situation which, if not discouraging, is
sertalnly less encouraging than last year. We
ire assured of good wheat and hay crops. The
Vnr.er is especially important, for owing to
<he fl.crtage in Euroi>e we are sure of a good
/xi*jit demand at satisfactory prices. This
neans a high degree of prosperity for the
rheat-erowing regions, good hauls for the
railroads and a favorable effect upon our for
ilgn trade balance. This is the best that can
>e said of the crop situation. Prolonged
Irought in some sections and too much rain in
rthers fcave been anything but beneficial to
:rop? in general. The injury' to com is already
!amll'Â£r. Laxe corn has shown great improve*
jient during the last three weeks, and crop
tstimates are being eteadily raised, but it is
Utogeth*r too early yet to place any fixed re
lance en estimates of yield, late corn being
â¢specially liable to frost damage. Should corn
tscaDP irost and the weather continue favor-
Ible the remainder of the season we might
iap!ly liarvest a crop of 1400 to 1500 millions,
tut the frost possibility makes a very lm
>ortant 'if.' Fortunately the partial ltss of
lie corn crop will prove In no sense a calam
ty, but In spite of favorable offsets It will
mforce economy amontr large numbers of farm
?rs and of necessity be a check upon business
ictlvlty. Its effects will be felt among mer
thants, by the railroads and in the provision
narkc-ts during the fall and winter months
gather than now. Another important crop is
eeling ad\-erse weather conditions, and that
f cotton. Too much rain in some sections and
too little in others. Texas, which raises be
â¢tveon a quarter and a third of the cotton
Â«rop, is suffering from a severe drought, and
â¢rill certainly produce considerably less cotton
han last year. The less In this State (Texas)
rill be partially offset by increased yield in
ither States, but the cotton trade is fully
fconciled to a smaller crop than last year by
KÂ»vcral hundred thousand sales. The diminu
tion of two such important crops as corn and
rotton cannot be considered an element of
>roEperity even if higher prices largely com
â¢ensate therefor. The country is likely to be
trosperous in epots and backward elsewhere.
1 rood deal of talk Is heard about our pros
â¢ect'.ve large exports to Europe. . This is likely
o be true as regards foodstuffs, which Eu
ope will be compelled to buy from us. but as
Â«gards our manufactured r>roductH. which
lave become uuch an important factor in our
ocport trade, it ehould be remembered that
loth England and Germany have been going
hrough a period â¢ of depression and lower
irlcp, lessening thÂ«>lr purchasing powers and
>!acing them In a better position for under
telling us in foreign markets. The lower level
â¢f the foreign markets is also likely to etlmu
at<? the shipments of merchandise to this
fountry, hence the natural tendency of our
toreign trade would be toward smaller ex
torts and larger imports, or a gradual re
ruction of the abnormal trade balance which
tan been such a feature of our prosperity dur
nÂ« the lart three or four years. Much, how
rt-er. depends upon the foreign demand for
:rajn and cotton."
New York Stock Market.
NEVT YORK. Sept. 4.â To-day's stock mar
ket was an almost exclusively professional
affair, with evidence of a participation by the.
speculative party which is rather vaguely
characterized as "the Western contingent"' by
the tradsrs about the Stock Exchange.' This
party has been active at intervals in the stock
market ever since the corn crop prospects be
came an element in the speculation. They
continued the sale of stocks this morning, but
early became Impressed with the ' notable
paucity of the offerings which were brought
out under the pressure they put on the market
and reversed their position to the buying side.
The free offerings of corn to-day may .have
had an influence on these covering operations.
The day's movement of prices seemed largely
due. however, to maneuvers by contending pro
fessional operators, following yesterday's sharp
break, which in Itself was apparently a test
ing operation by the capitalists who have sup
ported the market for some time past. They
seemed satisfied with their demonstration of
the email amount of stock impending over the
market for dlslodgment and their brokers were
large buyers again to-day, especially of United
States Steel stocks, in which they were Joined
by "the Western contingent." These stocks
did not move upward until there had been
sharp advances In Colorado Fuel and Ten
nessee Coal, based upon the assumption that
their business was largely Increased as a re
sult of the enforced idleness of United States
Steel Corporation works. Chicago Great West
ern continued strong on rumors of buying for
control in the interest of the Western railroad
community of interest and the recent large
accumulation of Mexican National was un
abated to-day. The strong tone permeated the
whole market as the day progressed and the
final hour showed many of the market leaders
among the grangers. Pacifies, Southwesterns,
coalers and specialties from 1 to 2 points over
last night's close. Conditions In the money
and exchange ffi**k?ts were practically un
changed.
The railroad bond market was dull and nar
row. Total sales, par value, 1,480,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

Far down in that little canyon that was
named after the big redwood trees that
once grew thickly . on the hillsides live
Michael Murphy and Eugene Riley. They,
have small canyon ranches that are as
wild as if they were hundreds of mi!e3
away In the heart of the Sierras instead
of being less than ten miles distant from
the city of Oakland. Redwood Canyon is
narrow and its sides are steep. Cultiva
tion of the ground is difficult and not ac
companied by any great profit. Â¦ â¢
Michael Murphy and Eugene Rlley, res
idents of the canyon, have been quarrel
ing over a fence line. The amount of land
involved in the dispute is not great
and would hardly recompense them, for
the amount of fighting and the trouble
that has already occurred. But neither
side would yield, and the bitter feeling
grew while the disputed fence remained
on the ground. .. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦- - . .- :.
An effort was made yesterday to set
the fence. Michael Murphy had several
men behind him. Eugene Riley was sim
ilarly enforced. The battle first raged
with fists and there were several sore
heads and disfigured faces, as a result.
Suddenly two shots rang out and the fight
stopped. The shots came from a neigh
boring hilltop, and Michael Murphy says
the bullets came near him. He' says the
shots w%re fired by John McCarthy,- a
young man who is in love with the
daughter of Eugene Riley. This is the
story- Murphy told Justice Prowse of
Haywards yesterday and upon which a
warrant was issued for McCarthy's arrest
on a charge of assault with intent to kill.
A disputed fence line, a love affair, a fist
fight between members of two factions
and several rifle shots fired from a hilltop
at one of the faction leaders, have com
bined to start a feud in Redwood Canyon.,
But, unlike a Kentucky feud, the partici
pants are not depending wholly upon
their rifles and their fists. They have car
ried the battle to the Justice Court at
Haywards, where a warrant has been is
sued for the arrest of John McCarthy on
a charge of taking two shots at Michael
Murphy.

.".The men whose names are mentioned in
the committee's resolution are accused* of
being the prime Instigators in the â¢ rush
movement. , On . August 23 they, with a
crowd of other students, attempted Â¦ to
break up the freshman organization meet
ing in progress in Harmon gymnasium.
A conflict ensued, but the freshmen, aided
by the Juniors, managed to keep the at
tacking sophomores out of the building.
The main door of the gymnasium, Â¦ was
carried away, during one, of the struggles
and other damage of a like nature wag
done to university property. Worse than
this, however, the > rush occurred â¢ after
President Wheeler had issued - a "; special
notice requesting those ; not concerned In
the meeting to stay away. .
The affair was given into the hands of
the Associated Students and > that body
turned It over -to its executive committee
with power .to act.' A. series of apologies
to President , Wheeler following, rapidly
after the rush served to stop severe pun
ishment. President Wheeler has agreed
to act according to the committee's find
ing, so that no further notice of the fray
will be taken.
- Resolved, That any similar action In - the
future j either of ' these students or any Â¦ others
will be considered cause for severe discipline
to the extent of suspension or expulsion from

be condemned by the Associated Students of

that the actions of S. R. Danebaum of the
junior class. W. A. B. Woods and F. W.
Skinner of the sophomore class are worthy of
censure because of actions not only thought
less but malicious; but since aforesaid: stu
dents have since apologized' to President
Wheeler and otherwise shown their regret for

As to the appointment of the ancillary
receiver. Judge Seawell held that this ap
pointment was unnecessary and also voiÂ«_
by reason of the failure of the action.
Judge Sea well found that the first pro
ceeding in the Indiana courts, by which
dark was appointed receiver and upon
which appointment he instituted this ac
Â¦tfcori. was insufficient to vest him with
ptjwer to sue In this State. But, said the
court, had this suit been brought after
Clark's appointment under the second
proceeding, after the order had been de
clared insolvent, the case would have
been different; bux the first proceeding,
merely calling for the appointment of a
receiver and nothing more, vested the re
ceiver with no power to oring an action
of the nature of that atÂ»the bar.

The Board of Education Is keeping good
Its announced intention to infuse new
blood into the department by appointing
outside teachers to the exclusion of those
already In the rervlce who have gathered
the wisdom of experience. At yesterday's
meeting F. E. Perham was elected to the
vacancy created fn the Lowell High
Bchool by the transfer of M. B. Blanch
erd, teacher of English. Perham Is an
other recruit plucked from the university
graduates and does not reside in this city,
or at least his name Is not In the city di
rectory. Owing to the partiality of Phe
lan s board for strangers Perham will
Henceforth receive a. salary of ?175 per
month.
Perham Wjas appointed though he is not
possessed of a city certificate, as the law
requires. Mark confided to Superintend
ent Webster that Perham was possessed
of university credentials, and if they are
found to be correct he will be granted a
temporary certificate until next Decem
ber, when the board meets to issue regu
lar ones. A resolution was adopted fixing
the regular semi-annual meetings of the
b Â°a r d on the last Wednesdays of June
and December.
' In order to inject an element of contest
for the position. President Klncaid placed
tne name of Miss Gertrude Henderson of
lÂ«os Angeles in nomination, but the votes
) of the other three Directors were cast for
Perham.
The cars were smashed somewhat, but
not enough to prevent them going back
to the powerhouse without assistance. The
woodwork . and \ glass were shattered. An
Investigation into the cause of the acci
dent will be conducted by the railway of
ficials, when., the responsibility for it will
be fixed. Â¦" . ;
The eastbound car was not seen by
Motorman Pollard of car No. 8 until he
was almost upon it. The glass in frffnt
of him was -coated by the fog and mois
ture and he was not looking for any meet-
Ings at that point. When he did see No.
24 he was within a hundred feet of it. He
tried to bring his car to a stop and partly
succeeded, but the Impetus was too great.
The cars came together hard. '
C. J. Reichert of Elmhurst was on car
No. 8 going to his work at an Oakland
flour mill. He was sitting In the front
end of the car when the collision occurred
and did not see that it was Impending in
time to jump. He was thrown against one
of the stanchions and slightly bruised
about the back and, shoulders. The rail
way officials took charge of him and took
him to his home, where he is being
treated.
Partly Stops Car.
A thick fog made it impossible for the
motorman to see any distance ahead, but
he had no thought of danger. He kept
the window in front of him down so that
he could see ahead as much as possible.
Suddenly., after he had reached a point
500 feet distant from the High street road,
a car loomed through the fog. Â¦ Apply
ing the brakes hard Motorman Duston
sought to bring the car to a standstill. At
the same .time he shouted to the passen
gers to jump. The passengers scrambled
off in a hurry and just cleared the car in
time in avoid the crash.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Sept. 4.
: " In a collision between two cars of the
Oakland, San Leandro and Haywards
; electric line on the county road early this
morning one man was hurt and the lives
of thirty passengers were endangered. One
of the Cars was crowded with working
people bound for the cannery at San Le
andro, who jumped off . just in time to
avoid .the crash. The accident was due to
the heavy fog. that prevailed and the de
sire of the motorman of the eastbound
car to get his passengers to their desti
| nation on time.
No. 8 was the eastbound car. It was
the first out from Oakland and was in
' charge of Conductor Lamoureaux and
I Motorman Duston. There were twenty-five
: or thirty people on board. They were all
! employes of the fruit cannery at San Le
; anaro, where they were due to begin their
day's work at 7 o'clock. In deference to
the wishes expressed by several of them
j Motorman Duston hurried his car in or
der that they might reach their destina
tion on time.
No. 24 was the first westbound car. It
left the Â¦ powerhouse at Elmhurst.at 6:15
o'clock. It carried six passengers going
to work in Oakland "and San Francisco.
i Conductor Allen and Motorman Pollard
were the men in charge of it. *
Motormen* Unable to See.
It is customary for these cars to meet
on the double tracks near. High street,
but this morning Motorman Duston, in
his haste to cover the distance to San Le
andro,-continued to move eastwardly,
hoping to make the siding -near the Mel
| rose Coursing Park before., the car ap
proaching from the other direction reached
The Sharpe divorce, to which Mr.
Schaffer refers, was granted about two
months ago. Mrs. Sharpe charged . her
husband with statutory cruelty, and he
did not make any answer in the courts
though he made .the statement at the
time that the cause of the breaking up of
his family was Mrs. Brandes.
Mrs. Schaffer has taken a great Inter
est in Christian Science and ranks as
first reader of the Second Christian
Science Church of East Oakland. She has
a Christian Science reading-room at her
residence, which is devoted to Christian
Science literature.
The complaint is quite a long one and
charges that* Mr. Schaffer did not prop
erly provide for his family, that he used
his money for his own purposes, and that
he drank and gambled, that he ill-treated
his wife arhome and caused her great
mental anguish.
When I went East I broke up house
keeping and stored my furniture, and
my. wife stayed at a hotel with the chil
dren and her mother. \ After I got back
and while we were still living at * the
hotel she took the furniture out of stor
age and opened some kind of a Christian
Science home In East Oakland.- She
had become interested in that and went
to an extreme on it. I fouild that my
home was turned into one of those places
with a big sign out, 'Christian Science
Reading-room.' It was no â¢ longer a
home. It was a place where people
came in without knocking or ringing the
bell.
"And over all this Mrs. Brandes con
tinued to hover like an evil spirit.
"I am going to fight the case because
I don't want my children to be subjected
to influences like these." v .-
Opens Christian Science Home.
"She has secured complete control over
my wife. Why, she even interested her
in the cases of those three toughs who
were accused of assaulting a girl in
West Oakland, and she, with my wife
assisted in securing money for their de
fense.
"I have not cut any figure at home
since Mrs. Brandes appeared there.
"And while this is going on families
are broken up, children are made parent
less and husbands are deprived of home
and happiness. I may be a little bitter,
but I have suffered and I feel what I
say. .
"Now I have fallen a victim to the same
malign influence in exactly the same way.
She has probabiy given my wife the same
advice that she gave Mrs. Sharpe.
"That woman- is dangerous to be at
large. She has the power of a Svengali
and she casts her spell over women who
will listen to l.er. She makes her living
by breaking up families, as she has done
mine. As long as she can get the woman
to listen to her and can keep the hus'
band away from home or get the woman
to sue for^divcrce she can live at their
expense. When she can no longer work
her baneful arts upon one family she ex
tends her Influence, like some poisonous,
vicious thing, over another, and so she
continues to live.
,- Mrs. Brandes a Svengali. . - \>
"Since then I have learned that Mrs.
Brandes has been the cause of another di
vorce. She appeared in the family of Mr.
Sharpe, a neighbor of mine, under the
name of Rosa Theil. and it was over a
year ago that the advised Mrs. Sharpe to
sue her husband for a divorce. Mrs.
Sharpe has since done so, and I believe
that she secured her divorce some months
ago, her husband not desiring to make
any contest.
"How my wife became interested in this
strange woman I do not know. All that I
know Is that one day I came home as
usual and found a woman in black sitting
at my table. &he was introduced to me
as Rosa Theil, a widow, who was in deep
trouble and in whom my wife had taken
an interest and whom she wanted to help.
She occupied part of my house, sat at my
table and was part of my family for a
considerable period of time before I found
out who she was. My surprise can be im
agined when I found out that she was the
wife of a man who had been convicted of
a most brutal murder and who .was ac
cused of being a party to an effort to con
ceal the crime, even If she was not really
a party to it. There was no palming off
the innocent wife of a brutal husband
upon me, for she had been proven in the
first trial to be nearly as bad as her hus
band, and there was then hanging over
her head a charge of being accessory to
the murder. There she was in my house
in daily communication with my children
under an assumed name. I refused to al
low it, and then came the first open rup
ture. , . /
"Over all of this is the trail of the ser
pent," said Paul J. Schaffer, when he was
served with the complaint, "and the ser
pent is Mrs. Etta Brandes. The woman
who was accused of aiding her husband
in the murder of their daughter is the
woman who broke up my home and that
of others of whom I know. Against my
wife I have nothing to say, except that I
am afraid that Mrs. Brandes and a too
close study of Christian Science has
turned her head. I hardly believe that
any one in complete possession of her fac
ulties would have done what she has
done.
The Trail of the Serpent.
Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Schaffer are well
known In Oakland. He has been promi
nent in politics for a number of years,
was Secretary of the Board of Health
for a long while, was later secretary for
Congressman Metcalf, and has served as
Deputy Postmaster of Oakland for nearly
two years. Only < among a few of the
friends of the couple has the story of their
differences crept out. The divorce papers
wera flled for Mrs. Schaffer this after
noon by Chapman & Clift, her attorneys.
Mr. Schaffer announces that he will make
a contest for the purpose of securing pos
session of the three. children. Up to the
present time Mr. Schaffer has not dis
cussed his family affairs, but with the
filing: of the complaint he comes out open
ly and charges his troubles against Mrs.
Brandes, the wife of the man who is serv
ing a ten-year term in Folsom prison for
the murder of his daughter, and the wo
man who figured in the case in nearly
as culpable a degree as her husband.
A divorce suit was filed to-day by Zebu
line H. Schaffer against Paul J. Schaffer,
Deputy, Postmaster of the city of Oak
land. Mrs. Schaffer charges her husband
with extreme cruelty and general neglect,
a failure to support her and a lot of col
lateral charges. But in and around all
this there is woven a queer, strange story
in which Mrs. Etta Brandes appears as
the woman, of mystery â an actual woman
In black, posing under the name of Rosa
Thell. Mr. Schaffer says that Mrs. Bran
des has broken up his family and the
families of others, and to this weird
woman he attributes all of his troubles.

of New Jersey will be the maid of honor
and little Miss Alma Doane and Master
Osborne Doane will be the ribbonTbearersr
It is to be a white and green wedding.
The bride will wear an elegant gown of
white satin elaborately trimmed with old
Irish point. Her bouquet will be composed
of white violets. Miss Burrowes will
wear a dainty gown of- white mull over
white silk. She will carry a bouquet of
white violets. Miss Crowell, the fair
bride to be, is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles R. Crowell of this city. Dur

Miss Harriet M. Griswold and John A.
Faull were married last evening at the
home of the bride's aunt, Mrs. W. 0.
Gould, on Central avenue. On account of
recent bereavements in the families of
both the bride and groom the wedding
was a very quiet affair and only the im
mediate friends and relatives witnessed
the ceremony, which was performed by
the Rev. Dr. Clampett.
Miss Sophie Faull was maid of honor
and Miss Edith Lynn was bridesmaid.
Henry Faull. brother of the groom, was
best man, and Dr. W..P. Griswold, broth
er of the bride, gave her away.
The bride wore an elegant gown of white
crepe de chine. The skirt was made en
train and the corsage was trimmed with
duchesse lace. Miss Faull and Miss Lynn
were attired alike in dainty gowns of
white point d'esprit over white silk.
Mr. and Mrs. Faull will leave to-day for
their future. home in Portland, Or. , .
Captain and Mrs. Trayner will leave to
day for New Mexico, where, they will
make their future home.
The lady who last evening became Cap
tain Trayner's' bride is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. John E. Roddy. She is
charming and accomplished and is the
fortunate possessor of- a magnificent
soprano voice.
Miss Roddy was touring New Mexico
with a concert company. The night the
company opened Captain Trayner, who
had just returned from a European visit,
dropped into the hall just as Miss Roddy
was finishing her last number. One glance
was enough for the Royal Dragoon. He
saw the lady, she conquered and twenty
four hours later they had been properly
introduced, and the second son of Lord
Trayner of the Grange, Edinburgh, Scot
land, was putting forth his best efforts
to win her.
The wedding, of last evening was the
culmination o'f a pretty romance, the
opening chapter of which was placed in a
concert hall in New Mexico.
At 8 o'clock, in the presence of 100 in
vited, guests, the young couple took up
their position beneath the flag canopy and
were made husband and wife by Bishop
Nichols. The bride was attended by her
sister, Miss Mazle Roddy, who officiated
as maid of honor. Myron H. Peck acted
as best man, and little Miss Marion Rich
ards as ring-bearer. 1
The bride wore a dainty gown of white
pina cloth elaborately trimmed with
mousseline. The regulation Bridal veil and
wreath of orange blossoms completed the
costume.
. Miss Mazie Roddy wore a pretty gown
of pink pina cloth trimmed with pink
chiffon. Miss Marion Richards was daint
ily gowned in blue pina cloth, trimmed
with chiffon. .

Adelaide Roddy, and Captain R. W. Max
well Trayner, formerly of the Royal
Dragoons, H. M. A., but now a big ranch
owner of New Mexico. Elaborate prepa
rations were made for the wedding. In
the handsome drawing-rooms, where the
ceremony was performed, the folds of the
American and English flags were grace
fully intermingled, and with Â» the aid of
trailing vines and brilliant-hued blossoms
made a most attractive decoration.

The British ship Celtic Chief arrived
from Valparaiso on Tuesday, and Captain
Jones reported speaking: the San Francisco
owned bark Lord Templetown on August
29, in latitude 39 degrees north, longitude
130 degrees west. The Celtic Chief was in
ballast and making better time than the
Lord Templetown, so the captain ef the
latter asked particularly to be reported
"all well" should the Celtic Chief reach
port first. Captain Jones made the report
as requested, and it brought relief to
Captain McCracken's friends. The follow
ing excerpt ,from the log of the Lord
Templetown will explain the reason why:
"On August 29, In < latitude 3d degrees 3
minutes north,- longitude 130 degrees 5
minutes west, to the wife of Captain
James McCracken. a eon." As ' soon as
Mrs. McCracken is able to- be up and
about there will be a christening on the
Lord Temoletown, but the name of the
baby has not yet been decided upon.
The passage of the Lord Templetown
from Newcastle. Australia, was an un
eventful one. During the first part of thÂ©
run heavy weather was encountered, but
the latter part was marked by light winds
and calms. On July 10 a dead calm pre
vailed and the run for the day is marked
in the ship's log with the zero- mark. '

REAL ESTATE TBAUSACTIONS.
OAKLAND, Sept. 4.â Ldvermore- Valley
ranchers are In bad straits because of the
shortage of freight cars. For three weeks
not a car has been sent to Altamont for
hay shipments. Farmers are trying to
ease the situation by hauling to Liver
more warehouses, but the distance Is too
great to allow of more than a round trip
a day for teams.
From Pleasanton comes the same-com
plaint that shipments of hay and grain
to San Francisco are at a standstill. The
railroad company Is supplying no cars
because ..the. strike prevents rapid hand
ling of shipments in San Francisco, ana
a blockade would result were the farm
products sent to the city. *

Now, the bridal party has an Idea that
the groom's younger brother and the or
ganist hatched a plot that was only too
successfully carried out.
Whatever happened Alameda is quits
certain that "Just One Girl" was never
played on a church organ at a wedding
before.
Suddenly there was a movement all over
the church. There was something strange
ly familiar about the music that was be
ing played. It did not savor of church
and weddings. It was "Just One Girl"
being played upon a church or
gan, with variations that robbed It of
some of its characteristics, but none of
its melody. The guests smiled and then
tittered and then laughed, for they saw
and heard that some one had been play
ing just a. little Joke on the bridal party.
Then the bridal party entered and the
music changed slowly to the wedding
march from "Lohengrin," but not until
the couple had an opportunity to catch
an idea of what had happened.
The ceremony was quietly performed,
and aa the party left the church there
was a sudden drop from the music of
romance to the steps of ragtime. The
guests ara sure that It was ragtime and -
that they know ragtime when they .
hear it. -
The friends of the couplÂ© werÂ« waiting
for the entrance of the bridal party, and
there were only the whispers that will
float about a church at such a moment.
The organ began to play and the guests
turned, expecting to see the bridal party
enter.
The wedding took place in the First
Congregational Church last evening and
was one of the prettiest of the ceremonies
that have taken place in Alameda this
year. The . young couple are very well
known in the Encinal City, and as> they
have hosts of friends the church was
crowded. Rev. Frank S. Brush of the
First .Presbyterian Church had been
asked to perform the ceremony, as thÂ»
First Congregational Church Is at .pres
ent without a pastor.
That was the kind of music that was
served up at one part of the church event
at which Miss Rita Penfleld and Fred
erick Elster became husband and wife last
night. Now the newly married couple- are
looking for the one who put up the joke,
and they think that it has been located
at the door of the proverbial younger
brother.

was a well-known character about thf>

. Herrin quoted a decision from the Su
preme Court, which has decided that a
railroad company is not bound to lower
Us rates on account of farmers not beine
able to make money. He took a few flings
at Attorney Short's figures andvthen
closed the case for the railroad corpora
tions.
Attorney Short will close his argument
for the plaintiff this morning. It fa more
than probable that the Railroad Commis
sioners will not decide the case until the
early part of next month.
"You cannot take a certain rate." he
Bald. "and. make It apply to every case."
Chief Counsel Henin then threw a fÂ»w
words of advice to the oil men gratis. He
thought that the condition of the oil mar
ket showed that there was an overpro
duction and that for a while, until the
price became higher, producers should
combine, make a sort of trust, or else
keep their oil in the ground. He thought
that from Le Blanc's action he had no
real grievance, but that he had gone to
other oil men and told them that he
would try to help them In getting a lower
freight rate.
Benin's Advice to Oil Men.
Henin spoke at much length to show
that the transportation of lumber from
Orejron to San Francisco was not a pay
ing investment in one way. The railroad
company, however, did not give the lum
bermen the same service as it did the oil
men at Bakerslield. The lumber 'was only
shipped to this city when there were
plenty of cars to do the hauling. Besides
the railroad company had land in the lum
ber districts, which It now sold on ac
count of the lumber industry at an aver
age of $6 per acre.
Attorney Foulds In bis argument was
full of reasons why the oil Industry was
not on a paying basis. He said there was
an overproduction of the article, and that
the demand and that alone would make
the price of the article.
In the afternoon W. F. Herrln made the
closing argument for the railroad com
panies. The attorney commenced by go-
Ing into the history of the transportation
of oil from its infancy. He told how a
low rate was made from Los Angeles to
this city for oil. It was done, he ex
plained, so that the Southern Pacific could
protect Its interests, it being threatened
with a low rate by water should it fall
to make a low rail rate. He followed by
saying that the attorney for the plaintiff
had no right to take the charge for the
transportation of lumber from Oregon to
San Francisco as an example of a low
rate.
Foulds Cries Over-Production.
The attorney closed his argument by
eaying that oil men did not want a re
duced rate and the railroad companies
could not haul oil from Bakersfleld at 25
cents a barrel.
The most Interesting; part of Attorney
Norton's argument to the Railroad Com
missioners was an account of how oil had
been substituted by the Santa Fe system
for coal, showing what a vast amount ot
money had been saved by the change. It
clearly demonstrated that the use of oil
as fuel for railroads was a clear matter
of economy. The attorney stated that the
Santa Fe in the past had paid $6 a ton for
coal. When it substituted oil for coal a
vast amount of money had to be expend
ed in putting new lire plates and pans into
the locomotives. It paid and still had a
contract for oil at $1 a barrel. Four bar
rels of oil were equal to a ton of coal, so
In every four barrels It saved J2. Attor
ney Norton said that from the . first the
railway company had * saved $40,000 a
month.
Attorney Norton, In continuing his ar
gument, said the testimony In - the case
had proved that the oil Industry would
not be Improved by a reduction In the
present rate between Bakersfleld and this
city. He also wanted to Impress upon the
Railroad Commissioners that the rate
was most generous. It was even, so Mr.
Eproule had said, on the stand, "the low
est rate in the State."
The case yesterday was devoid of any
dramatic or sensational developments; In
tact, it appears to be of little Interest to
oil men throughout the State, as they are
conspicuous by their absence.
Railroad Commissioners In the oil rate
case. He closed In an hour and was fol
lowed by Attorney J. E. Foulds of the
Southern Pacific. In the afternoon Chief
Counsel Herrin took the floor and made
the dosing argument for the railroad peo
ple.

Fe Railway, continued his argument at 10
o'clock yesterday morning before the

Three rousing 1 cheers for Father Cullen
were given at the close by the Juvenile
contingent, which crowded the rear of the
hall.
A club to be known Â¦ as the Mountain
View Club has been formed by about 100
members of the parish to assist Father
Cullen in erecting a church. â¢ <
Lastly you have come as the pillars of the
parish, you who bear the church's burden, to
show your appreciation. I thank you one and
all, and in you, all the people of this parish.
I wish you from my heart every happiness and
success in every undertaking, spiritual and
temporal, and I bid you all an affectionate and
fond farewell.
The Rev. Father Lagan expressed his
regret at losing his valued assistant, with
whom he had been associated for the past
five years.
The many testimonials I have received from
those connected with the church render it
more difficult to break the union that has ex
isted between us for five years. The altar
boys have shown their affection by presenting
me .wltj} an outfit for the altar. The boys
of the vesper choir have also given evidence
of their love and esteem. The Ladles' Sodality,
of which I had charge, has also shown its ap
preciation, and to them I feel deeply grateful.
The boys of Company D, League of the Cross
Cadets, have been so dear to me that our
parting is more in the nature of a family
separation than that of friends. I learned to
love and ilka them. Their manliness and up
right, straightforward manner I always ad
mired. And If I had five years more In Bac
red Heart Parish it would be a repetition of
the past, and I would never regret anything
I could do for their betterment and success.
I feel that it was not necessary for you to
assemble here and give expression to your re
gret at my departure, for I have already had
ample proof of your sincere regard for me.
It Is needless to say that I appreciate your
gracious donation. If money were a test of
friendship, you have given me a strong proof
of your affection. From the parish as a whole
I have had nothing but kindness without stint
or limit and therefore my heart is a well of
gratitude and words fall roe to express my
appreciation.
Mr. Chairman and kind friends: I " thank
you and the people of the Sacred Heart Parish,
In whose midst I have been working for the
past five /years, for this token of friendship
and convincing proof of your appreciation of
the work done while here. I must Interpret
your presence here this evening as a sanction
and approval of my labors for the past five
years. Tour kind expressions make it diffi
cult for me to find words to thank you as I
desire. Had I been permitted to leave the
parish quietly, as I came to it. I would still
consider myself as parting with the dearest
of friends. Your kind words in my regard
will serve as an incentive and encouragement
in other fields. Whenever I asked your co
operation to parish work given to my charge
your response was prompt and your generosity
In keeping with the demands of the under
taking.
Reference was made to the high regard
in which Father Cullen was held by every
one, and Meherln concluded by offering
the departing priest a purse of nearly
$1500.
Father Cullen was greatly overcome,
but finally voiced his thanks as follows:
While your removal from Sacred Heart Par
ish may be deemed advisable by those under
whose directions It Is about to take place, I
speak for a great maay*of the church mem
bers of this parish, and positively for my
self, that your removal is very positively
against our wishes. We regret it very much,
and our hope is that the members of the par
lsh to which you are about to be transferred
will appreciate your eelf-eaciindng and kindly
nature as we do. To know you insures love
and high respect for you, and the more inti
mately you are known, the greater the love
and the higher the respect. Self-sacrifice for
the comfort. Instructions and advantages of
others has been tbÂ» constant practice of your
life. Tour sermons, your private advice and
conversation, have been alike and uniformly
pure, simple, eloquent, instructive, convincing,
and so practical u to be useful to all who
have had the advantage and pleasure of either
hearing you or of coming within the Influence
of your presence.
M._ Meherln acted as chairman of the'
meeting. When Father Cullen entered the
hall he was greeted with great applause.
The address read by Meherin voicing the
sentiments of the parishioners was | In

RECEIVES A PURSE
Five of the new locomotives will burn
oil and will. be fitted with Vanderbilt
boilers and corrugated flues In place ot
the old style fire box. These flues will bÂ©
much the same as those now in use on
marine boilers, and It Is expected they
will be able to withstand the expansion
and contraction consequent on .the flerco
heat they will conduct. The trouble with
using oil In the old fire boxes was that,
being joined and riveted, they would not
give without opening. The oil was served
by the means of a blower, and this pro
duced a blast heat that . the boxes could
not stand. The consequence was r, they
were continually leaking and the repair
expenses were something enormous. The
new flues are* all of one piece and their
corrugation is expected to give them the
necessary expansion. Kruttschnitt said
there would be no saving on fuel, as the
oil was, if anything, a little more ex
pensive than coal. The saving will como
in on the fewer repairs made necessary.
The rumor that was current yesterday
that Assistant Passenger, Agent James
Horsburgh, who is 'now with E. O. Mc-
Cormick in Chicago, would return from
his journey as assistant passenger traffic
manager is contradicted by -those who
are in a position to know. | Horsburgh has
been summoned to, Chicago with E. L.
Lomax, genera] passenger ; agent of the
Union Pacific: D. E. Burley of the Ore
gon Short . Line, and A. L.Â» Craig of the
Oregon Railway- and Navigation Com
pany to confer with Stubbs, McCormick
and the Eastern passenger agents of the
Harriman lines regarding the advertising
end of the business. The idea is to , 'put
the advertising business of the entire syn
dicate on a general basis and to do away
as' much as possible with conflict in' the
issuance of -reading matter. Â¦
When seen yesterday Kruttschnitt said
that the first of the 103 new heavy loco
motives that had been ordered by the
company had already been delivered, and
it would only be a short time before the
entire number would be in active opera
tion. These engines will be used on the
entire line from Ogden to San Francisco
and to New Orleans. Seventy of these
engines are freighters, eighteen are
switchers and the remaining fifteen are
the heaviest ten-wheel locomotives In the
United. States. .
General Manager Kruttschnitt, who has
lately returned from a tour of inspection
over the road as far south as New Or
leans, looks with favor on the innovation
and is hopeful that the test will prove
satisfactory and result in a great saving
in locomotive repairs, particularly In re
pairs made necessary by recurrent leak
ages of fire boxes.
Within the next few weeks the South
ern Pacific Company will make Its first
experiment with oil-burning engines. The
question of burning oil In locomotives has
been under discussion by the heads of the
operating department of the great rail
way corporation for some time, and now,
on the . recommendation of Master Me
chanic Small, the actual test is to be
made.

International complications will hardly
arise, Ruef says, . but If they do and a
French 3 battleship, should .be seen at
anchor some morning in the harbor It will
surely have come to enforce an indemnity
claim for a new suit of clothes preferred
by Henry Dellemange, Consul General of
France. '>>:â¢>;.* ' Â¦â¢: ? v
Henry Dallemagne, Consul General of
France at San Francisco, will set awhlrl
to-day the machinery of the law that
Process Server Joseph Kelly â may
bo subdued. If Kelly Is not Bub
dued â forced \ to realize his position
and the dignity that attaches to the
office of Consul General of Franceâ a rup
ture may result between two nations that
have been allies since the Immortal
Lafayette drew his sword in defense of
American liberty.
Dallemagne fell Into the hands of Pro
cess Server Kelly in front of the French
consulate at 316A Post street late last
evening. Kelly.' It is said, almost ripped
the clothing from off the body of the
French official. Dallemagne was angry.
He sought out his attorney, A. Ruef, and
laid the case before him. Until far into
the night Ruef scanned the pages of the
compiled treaties, studied up International
law invented new modes of torture; and
in imagination saw Kelly suffer in seven
different ways..
One Escande has a judgment against
Charles L. Tamm, secretary of the con
sulate. Under the direction of Escande's
attorney the Sheriff was called upon to
serve an order of examination upon
Tamm and to summon Consul General
Dallemagne to court. Dallemagne stood
upon his legal rights and remained In the
consulate. The Sheriff's attention was
called to the fact that he was without
right when he issued the summons. He
forthwith apologized. Consul General
Dallemagne thought the matter , was
ended, but he did not count upon the pro
cess servers. â¢ When they became too
numerous he called upon the District At
torney and was guaranteed protection.
Â¦ But the District Attorney was powerless
to stop Kelly. He lay In wait for hours
for the Consul General, and finally, seeing
him emerge from the door of the con
sulate, rushed upon him, "and," says the
Consul General, "ripped my coat to tat
ters and thrust an evil odored paper, in
my hands." .
Kelly hurried away, but was followed
by an attache of the consulate and forced
to give his name. Dallemagne . drew bis
tattered coat . about him and hurried to
the office of Attorney Ruef.Â» Then Kuef
went to work. The attention of the Sec
retary of State will be called to the out
rage, he says, and, furthermore, Kelly
as best bents a. case of battery, as Ruef
characterizes It, will appear before thÂ«
bar of the Police Court to make his de
fense. . - . ; "
