- From early morn till late * at .night
hundreds of men, women 'and. children
gathered yesterday in the park facing
the house where President McKinlev
watched by the " side "of~his -stricken
wife. - . .
During the hours preceding the' dawn
groups of men and a' few women 'kept
vigil' with the detective and police
guards and newspaper, representatives in ]

dense: masses Â¦ of wet fog hung over the

nation devotedly waited for. the issue of \
the battle between life and death. Only \

Congressman Kahn also called at the

During the afternoon the President
was able to leave the sickroom for a
considerable time and word was sent
out from the house that he was taking
a rest and had fallen asleep.
The President enjoyed a hearty din

consultation was so cheering that the
President announced to a few intimate
friends that he would visit the Union
Iron Works this morning if Mrs. Mc-

Hour after hour last night the im

CALL AT HOUSE
PHYSICIANS attending the
President's wife are inclined to
believe that she will soon re
cover sufficient strength to
travel by rail to her home in
Canton or to Washington. Her recu
perative power is something remark
able:
The crisis in her case was passed dur
ing the earlier hours of Thursday morn
ing. The doctors did not believe then
that she would rally. They feared that
she had but a slender hold on life and
must succumb to the prolonged prostra
tion. It was fortunate for the patient
that Dr. Hirschfelder was able to bring
quickly from the hospital near by just
such appliances as were needful in re-'
storing vitality.
The management of the case by the
doctors attending has been highly com
mended by physicians who have been
apprised of the treatment. The absorp
tion of salt water was timely, and its
infusion in the blood by hypodermic
process was successful.
Leading physicians not only entertain
the hope, but have confidence in the
prediction, that the patient will have
better health in the future than she has
had for many years." Yesterday morn
ing she talked to her attendants and
smilingly told one of her physicians that
she wanted fried chicken. She made an
effort to get up, contrary to the advice
of her physicians.
- -The patientc was blessed with several
hours' of natural- sleep early yesterday
morning, and awoke refreshed and con
fident of renewed strength. Opiates
were not administered to invite sleep,
but a powerful stimulant was given to
reinforce the action of the heart. The
expressed desire for solid nourishment
was accepted as a hopeful sign, but the
doctors believe that it is not prudent to
oblige her in this respect. For the pres
ent she will have to get along on such
rations as rice in chicken broth and
whites of- an egg beaten specially for
the occasion.
WASHINGTON, May 17.â Although
the White House is connected . directly
by telegraph with the Scott residence in
San Francisco, but little information
DIRECT WIRE TO
THE SCOTT HOUSE
of the entire country that Providence
MRS. McKINLEY is slowly
improving" were the
cheering ' words that
brought a ray of gladness
to President McKinley yes
terday, and to millions of men and
women in the United States, whose
hearts beat in sympathy with the chief
executive of the republic.
From the President's temporary resi
dence at the corner of Clay and Lacuna
streets, in this city, the news was flashed
to every part of this country and to all
quarters of the civilized world.
The terrible tension that held the peo
ple in awe lest their chosen head should
be stricken by the loss of his gentle wife
was relieved, and the news of the im
provement in Mrs. McKinley's condi
tion brought smiles to the faces of mil
lions.
Not only in San Francisco but in
every city, town and hamlet of the
United States the word was passed from
mouth to mouth . that the President's
wife was passing from the valley of the
shadow of death and that a merciful
Providence might spare the precious
life of the Lady of the White House.
In the morning the attending physi
cians held a consultation at the Scott
residence, and as a result of their delib
erations 'was soon known far and wide.
Mrs. McKinley had held her own on
Thursday night, and in the critical
hours of early morn of yesterday the pa
tient showed a slight improvement.
The anxious watchers by the bedside
of the President's wife noticed that her
strength was increasing, and the Presi
dent himself conveyed the news to the
members of his household. Gradually the
improvement increased, and when the
physicians left the house before noon it
was anonunced that they would not re
turn until the evening.
At the urgent solicitation of his
friends the President was induced to
leave the bedside of his wife for a brief
period in order that he mijrht take a
short drive. The chief executive de
sired that hi? police escort of mounted
officers be dispensed with, and he was
driven in a closed carriage to the- Pre
sidio grounds, remaining away from the
Scott home for thirty-five minutes.
In the afternoon the President se
cured a few hours' sleep, as he had
been without rest for twenty-four
honrs.
Secretary Cortelyou was busily en :
gaged yesterday in sending messages to
all parts of the country and abroad, eiv
ing the welcome news of the improve
ment in Mrs. McKinley's condition.
The sufferer was able to take some light
nourishment during the day. and her
strength increased each hour.
In the evening the attending: physi
sicians visited Mrs. McKinlev and
informed the President that his wife was
improving and that the conditions of
the morning had been maintained dur
ing the day. Within a few minutes the
whole country learned of the welcome
bulletin.
The President before retirine for the
night announced that he would visit the
Union Iron Works this morning pro
vided Mrs. McKinley continued to im
prove during the night and in .the early
hours of to-day. Secretary Cortelyou
stated that the President was most
anxious to meet the workmen of the
Union Iron Works at the reception they
have planned, but that the chief execu
tive \vould not stay for the launching of
the battle-ship, unless Mrs. McKinley
was considerably better.
In reply to a question Secretary Cor
telyou said that if Mrs. McKinlev con
tinued to improve the President would
return with his wife to Washington at
the first opportunity.
Secretary Cortelyou said that it was
impossible at the present time so say
when the President could go home with
his wife, but that it would not be for
a week or ten days.
When President McKinley retired to
his rest last evening he did so relieved
of the enormous strain of the previous
forty-eight hours and with the prayers

The handsome residence was all aelow with choicest blossoms in honor of the delightful event. Through- .
out the rooms the effect aimed for was the red, white and blue of the flag. Long stemmed American Beauty roses and .
brilliant red carnations lent the red effect, exquisite white roses and pale carnations: the -white effect and bunches of,
bachelor buttons gave the necessary touch of blue. . , " .
The table received the especial attention of the decorator, and in the center of the board proudly stood a magnifi

The news of the critical ill
ness of Mrs. McKinley
caused the deepest doom
to settfe over her home and
birthplace. Bulletins from
San Francisco were posted as quick

by Cantonians feverishly. Her old
friends and neighbors spoke of her con

DIVISION OF
SURPLUS CASH
According to present calculations much
of the money subscribed to carry out
banquets and other functions, which were
proposed in honor of the President, will
be refunded to those who paid for tick
ets. It is figured that each holder of a
$20 ticket to the citizens' banquet will re
ceive back $16 50. The estimate is that
Â« 50 on each ticket will be required to
meet expenses Incurred before the ban
quet was declared off.
Every member of the Union League
Club who paid in $10 for the luncheon
arranged In honor of the President will
get back $7 50.
Tickets to the Ohio Society banquet
were of two grades. The Ohio men were
assessed $10 a ticket, while others were
asked to pay $15 a plate. The function
was not canceled until the eleventh hour.
Before everything was declared off much
of the work of preparing decorations and
arranging for the dinner had been done.
Supplies contracted for had been deliv
ered before the order of cancellation was
authorized. It Is figured that the rebate
will be less than $5 on each: $10 ticket.-
The. money raised for the banquets is
apart from the sum of $32,000 collected by
the general committee for purposes of
street \ decoration, carriages â¢ and special
receptions. The Ohio Society, however,
was accorded the privilege of drawing
$6000 from the citizens' fund to carry out
functions under the auspices of the State
society.
In the general settling up of affairs
some intricate questions are sure to arise.
No doubt the citizens' committee will be
able to report a large surplus of cash on
hand after all just obligations have been
liquidated. Careful work In the auditing
of claims will' be required.

house he looked extremely pale, but his
face bore an expression of relief. He
was respectfully saluted by those around
the house and he returned their saluta

demonstration was made except' the
waving of handkerchiefs.
The President entered a closed car

other closed carriage bearing the police
bodyguard.

DIRECT WIRE TO SCOTT HOUSE
SANTA ROSA, May 17.â As the result of
a quarrel : between neighbors, Joseph
Schilling, a half-breed Indian, was shot
and fatally .wounded to-night by F. IX
Brown. The tragedy ! took | place on
Brown's farm, ten miles northeast of San-|
ta Rosa, and the weapon used was a shot
gun. ' Schilling was brought to Santa
Rosa and .sent to a. hospital, while Brown
surrendered" to the authorities;
Schilling is : employed on the farm of
Robert Mills, who lives in the foothills Be
yond . the home of Brown. Mills and
Brown have long been enemies. Early In
the present month Mills and Schilling
were arrested on a complaint swore to by
Brown, who charged that they had ap
peared at his place during his absence
and attacked his wife. The two men were
fined.
While returning from this city to the
Mills farm to-night Schilling stopped at
the Brown place. According to Brown, the
half-breed was intoxicated and quarrel
some and carried a rifle. Schilling was
warned that he would not be allowed to
cross Brown's farm on his way home,
which meant that he would have to take
a more roundabout course along the road.
Schilling became abusive and finally
raised his rifle and fired at Brown.
â¢ With the first appearance of his enemy
Brown had armed himself with a shotgun,
which was loaded with fine birdshot.
When Schilling fired at him and missed
he discharged both barrels of the shotgun
at his assailant. The charges took effect
in Schilling's head and breast, blinding
him in both eyes and literally riddling
him with fine shot. At the time of i the
shooting he was only forty feet distant.
Brown sent for assistance. In order that
Schilling might be cared for, and then
came to town to give himself up. When
Schilling was picked up to be brought to
the hospital his rifle was still in his hands.
At the hospital to-night he admitted that
he had been drinking, but claimed . that
Brown started the. trouble. Brown made
a statement, in whCch he deelared-he had
fired in self-defense after the half-breed
had opened the duel.

FEUD OF NEIGHBORS
LEADS TO A TRAGEDY
THE improvement in the condi
tion of "Mrs. McKinley yester
day did not necessitate the is
suing of as many bulletins as
on the previous day.
The first news of the day
was given out by Henry T. Scott, who
reported that the distinguished patient
had passed a comfortable night and that
her strength was increasing slowly..
When the physicians arrived at the
Scott residence in the moraine a large
number of people had jrathered in the
park facing the house, and they awaited
with breathless anxiety the decision of
the medical men.
Secretary Cortelyou at 8:45 a. m. is
sued the following bulletin:
"Mrs. McKinley has had a good night
and her condition is so much improved
that her physicians will not hold another
consultation until 8 p. m. The Presi
dent has not decided whether he will
participate in any of the events on the
programme to-day."
The physicians found the improve
ment in Mrs. McKinley was of such a
nature that they decided not to hold an
other consultation until the evening.
Although Secretary. Cortelyou had
announced that the doctors would* not
return to the house until the evening
some alarm was felt when Dr. Hirsch

The physician remained for nearly an
hour, but it was learned that no change
had taken place in the condition of the
patient.
Secretary Cortelyou at noon an
nounced that he would not give out any
bulletins until after the physicians had
seen Mrs. McKinley in the evening.
During the afternoon Mrs. McKinley
slept for some time, and also partook of
chicken broth and eggs and . brandy
beaten up. She also drank some coffee,
and the nurses in attendance noted a
steady increase in their patient's
strength.
Â¦When the President dined at 7 o. m.
Mrs. McKinley again partook of
chicken broth, and at 8:15 the physi
cians arrived at the house. Drs.
Hirschfelder, Gibbons and Rixey found
that Mrs. McKinley was still improv
ing, but that a small bone felon had de
veloped on her right hand. The felon
was lanced, and the physicians antici
pate no trouble from it whatever.
The doctors were in consultation for
three-quarters of an hour, and when
.they left the house Secretary Cortelyou
gave out the following bulletin at 0:30
p. m.:
"Mrs. McKinley's physicians find the
improved. condition of the morning has
been sustained throughout the day."

is a matter which had not been considered
by the strikers or the public and puts an

the extra men and night trippers to 19%
cents per hour, but refused to establish a
uniform rate of 20. cents an .hour for all'
employes, as requested by the. strikers.

Strike Complications Increase.
The reason there Is no settlement to
night is because the company refuses to
discharge the men brought from other
points to take the strikers' places.
The only step toward settlement that
was made was the appointment to-night
of a committee from the Common Coun
cil to arbitrate and the adoption of a reso
lution declaring that if a settlement is not
effected by Monday night the Council
shall revoke the franchise of the com
pany. The company declares that such
action will be of no effect as the road now

WICTIM OF SMALLPOX
CAUSES A STAMPEDE
Where the children did congregate,
however, the avenue seemed brighter, and
certainly there was enthusiasm for more
than a dozen parades, for the mere fact
that they were out of school during school
Incurs was enough to bring some consola
tion. The girls waved flags and sang
songs: the boys jostled and crowded for
the places next the curb; the teachers
hurried here and there to exert needed
authority to keep the midgets from leav
ing the line or losing themselves In the
general mix-up, and It was all motion and
life aud color. Miss Parker was out with
her flock, and when there seemed to be
no chance of the notables coming she set
the children to singing their songs, and
for half an hour the block rang with the
childish voices singing the old songs even
the children love long before they can un
derstand them. And they waved their
flags and shouted and cheered and had a
lovely time, even though they did not see
a real live President or even a Cabinet
officer.
It iff worth while trying the experiment
Â» gain If the President can find the time
and if the arrangements can . be left in
the hands of some one 'person who will
become familiar with the situation and
will not give different orders to every
school in the city. Had the affair been
properly managed the children could have
been on the avenue on time, the Presi
dent perhaps could have spared them
some part of an hour, or the Cabinet sec
retaries could have given the time for
him, and one of the prettiest affairs plan
ned for the week might not have failed
so utterly as did this one.
Plenty of Enthusiasm.
ing.
The first mistake waÂ« made Thursday
afternoon. When the President was try
ing to find a -way to attend the review,
and after he had told the Chief of Police
that he would send word at 9 o'clock that
evening. School Director Casserly called
upon the Chief and told him the review
had been declared off; that orders had
been sent to all the schools to hold the
children, and that there would be none
of them on the avenue. This Information,
from what might be called headquarters,
the Chief telephoned out to Mr. Cortelyou
and nothing further was thought of the
matter by either the President or the
Cabinet officers. In the meantime the
orders being sent around to the schools
were not that the parade had been de
clared off. but that" principals and teach
ers end children should watch the morn
ing papers and act according to the an
nouncement they contained.
Information Is Misleading.
"When the papers appeared in the morn
ing, however, it was found that each had
been told a different story about the par
ade, and the schools were as much in the
dark as before. Some came out on the
avenue, but the greater number did not
leave their schoolhouses. so instead of a
long line of bright-faced children lining
Van Ness avenue for blocks there was
here and there a crowd of children, bright
enough and enthusiastic but rapidly be
coming disappointed. There were no po
lice to guard the avenue and prevent
trouble, for Chief Sullivan, on the Infor
mation furnished by Casserly.had released
the squad he had detailed for that duty;
there was no President, for having been
Informed that the children would not be
out Mr. McKinley had put all thought of
the matter aside; there were no Cabinet
officers there, for the same reason, and
there were but a few children with flags
and banners and pathetically enthusiastic
la their still buoyant hope to see some one
truly great, no matter what his rank.
The Parker School, from Broadway and
Mason street, came over the hill four deep
und lined up on the west side of Van
Ness avenue between Jackson and Wash
ington streets. Just below them, toward
Jackson street and lined up along the
curb, for they were very small, were the
babies from the normal training school.
Across the way, where the Sherman
School was to have been, there were a
few people, but no children. Mr. Whits,
principal of the Spring Valley Grammar
School, sent his janitor out to the avenue
to find out what was doing, but he did
not send any of the children. â¢ The Han
cork School, with Its flag and uniformed
corps, marched up the avenue 'waving
flags and singing, to take Its place on the
curb beyond Washington. A few more
classes straggled up the avenue toward
Jackson street and a few more trotted
down toward Market street, but there
were big gaps in the line where different
orders and different information had kept
the children In their classrooms.
A GENERAL conflict of orders
and a misunderstanding of the
situation made a failure of
what might have been a re
view of the school children by
the President yesterday morn
ing. Up to the hour set for his
appearance no one knew defT
nitely whether or not he would be pres
ent, or In his absence, if any of the mem
bers of the Cabinet wculd do the review-

LAUNCHING OF
THE NEW OHIO

She Will Carry.
The act authorizing the building of the
Ohio, Maine and Missouri was passed May
4, 1SS8. When the bids were opened It was
found that Dialogue & Son had offered to
build one ship on department plans for
$2,840,000. The Newport News Company,
one ship, department plans, $2,580,000, and
one ship bidder's plans $2,680,000 and $2,850,
000. Cramp & Sons, one ship, department
plans,' }2,6oO,000; for two ships, department
plans, each $2,625,000, and for on.e ship,
bidder's plans, $2,725,000 and .$2,885,000 and
$2,700,000, and $2,870,000 each for two
ships, bidder's plans. Union Iron Works,
one ship, department plans,. $2,674,00 and
$2,725,000 and $2,899,000 for one ship bidder's
plans.
The contract for the Maine was let to
the Cramps on department plans, for the
Missouri to the Newport News Company
on department plans and for the Ohio to
the Union Iron Works on bidder's -plans
at the highest figure.
The first rivet in the keel of the Ohio
was not driven antil May 19, 1899. Ever
since the work has. proceeded without a
hitch, save that there have been some
delays due to Uncle Sam's tardiness in
supplying the armor plate.
There were some hitches in {he building
cf the Maine and Missouri, however. The
plans supplied by the Government were
modeled on those of a Russian battleship
and defects were found in them. This
necessitated some changes In the con
struction of the Maine and Missouri and
they are now practically the same as the
Ohio. 4
All the world has heard of the Oregon,
which has been aptly called "the bulldog
of the United States navy." No vessel
thty have ever built do the Scotts'take,
as much pride in. In comparing the Ohio
with her some idea of the former's dimen
sions will be gained.

to utilize the wealth of crude oil in Kern
COurity to supp'ly fuel in a practical form
tCKlhe residents of this city and Kern
villÂ£. For Bomeitime past the company
has , been experimenting with an appar
atus for the manufacture of gas from oil.
Tha.. experiments have been so satisfac
tory that a contract has been awarded
the California Light and Fuel Company
for a complete plant for this purpose. . .
TJjfe company expects to extend its sys

OIL IS STRUCK
IN NEW FIELD
ON the turn of the tide Just
after noon to-day the Ohio
will leave the cradle in which
she has been resting and
will take her place among
floating thi^s, where she
Â¦will fly her flag with the
proudest in the navy. - * k .
The arrangements for . the ' launching
have been completed and nothing now re
mains but to knock away the shores that
have held her for so long, let' her gently
down upon the sliding ways and then
Â¦wait until a woman's hand frees her from
her shore moorings and lets her slip Into
the baj\
The time set for the launching is 12:20,
or Just as the highest tide of the month
reaches Its full depth and hesitates a mo
ment before It runs back again into the
ocean. At that moment the ship will go,
for tide waits not even for battleships,
and the depth that will carry the huge
hull clear of the mud Is as fleeting as a
sunset sky, though sure as the sun.
It is almost a certainty that the Presi
dent will be there, for Mrs. MeKinley has
rallied so satisfactorily that he will 'feel
free to take the necessary time unless an
other unfortunate turn should hold him
at the bedside of his wlfe % The launch
ing is what he came West to see, but if
anything should keep him from it he will
at least be at the works in time to greet
the -workmen, for he lias said that he will
make every effort io meet the men who
build the best ships of the navy.
The reception to the workmen will be
held at 11 o'clock, and at that time they
Â¦will present the gold plate they have had
Â«ngraved as a souvenir of the President's
visit to the works. It was at first thought
that the" plate would have to be sent East
to him in default of his presence, but as
it is now practically certain that the
President will be at the reception at least
the plate can be presented as originally
intended. . ..
To prevent accidents and to protect the
workmen from annoyance before the
launching, no one will be allowed in the
y rds until 11 o'clock. A squad of police
under command of Lieutenant Mooney
will be on hand to enforce this order.
The President will leave his house at
half-past 9 o'clock and will take the
transport tug Slocum for the works. As
he passes down the bay the warships
will give him the full salute of twenty
one guns.
There are two lines of cars that reach
the Union Iron Works, one coming over
the hill by Sixteenth street and arriving
at Sixteenth by way of Flllmore and by
transfers from all the electric and cable
systems of the Western Addition and the
Mission, and another line running up
Kentucky street, reaching Kentucky
by way of Third street and by transfers
from the lower town systems of cable
and electric " cars. Any line that will
transfer to the Fillmore and Sixteenth
street lines vrtll bring passengers to the
works' that way, and any line that will
transfer to Kearny and Third streets will
get passengers to the works by way of
Kentucky street. Â«
The last and perhaps the most delicate
Â¦work of the launch will be done this
morning. The vessel is resting now on
her. shores and keel blocks, both per
. manent supports; she must have her
-weight transferred from these to the
cradle that rests upon the sliding ways,
and the old supports will have to be
knocked away. The cradle is wedged up
to take part of her weight and then the
shores and keel .blocks are cut away to
let the cradle take the remainder, and
then she will be held by a single beam
of wood, set like a trigger, ready to
epring aside and let her go only when
the proper force is brought to bear upon
It. .
j â¢ It Is a delicate piece of . work, delicate
even considering the thousands of tons
-that have to be handled/and a sigh of
relief will rise from the Union Iron
Works If to-moVrow. at half past 12,
without accident and without hitch, the
President MeKinley Will Almost Gevi&vciiy' Present at a Reception \ to the

LAUNCHING-OF
% THE OLD OHIO
How She Was Built and
Named and Sailed the
Stormy Waves. i
' To-day, May" 18;* 1901, the spiendld . new
battleship Oljio, the equal of any fighting
machine afloat, the product of California
enterprise and skill, will take the waters
of, San Francisco Bay. .On May 30, .1820,
nearly eighty-one ... y'earsi ago, an earlier,
Ohio, a. "ship of tho line," 'made her first
plunge into the waters of the Atlantic of.
Brooklyn; N. Y. .She, too, was one of the
finest specimens , of , American workman
ship afloat in her tirr.e.. :
She was built of wood, 198 feet long and
carried an armament of eighty-four guns;
twelve 8-inch pieces and , seventy-two 32
pounders, all' muzzle-loaders. Her, cost
was $547,889; less than one-fifth of that of
her namesake, which, . howeVer, will be
able to whip a sea tullof such battleships
as she was. The old Ohio performed much
useful service, but never had Â¦' an Â¦ oppor
tunity of testing her, fighting powers. She,
however, was on hand and ready along
these very coasts during the latter part
of . the Mexican war, and at its close she
"mosphere. . ;.
Thus/armed and equipped the Ohio will
be one of the most perfect lighting ma
chines in the i world. ,~-
remained for. some time as the flagship of
Captain Thomas Ap." Catesby Jones of
New Orleans fame, the then commander
of the Pacific squadron. She was put out
of -date by the naval developments of the
Civil War and in 1883 was sold for $17,100.
1 -What changes â¢ have been wrought - in
the period between the, two launchings?
Large libraries hardly suffice to tell.
"Where . the first Ohio could , have found
but a. handful of not friendly people a
great city of 400,000 people, citizens of the
United States, moves. to its bay shore to

The. United States ship of the line Ohio was
launched at Nsw York on Tuesday . last in the

sons, / amidst discharges of artillery from the
Washington, 74 guns, and the sloop Hornet,

vessels of .war, under 'the resolution of Con

the 25th ult; vfe understand, to assisn by lot
the name of the ship of the line just built at
New York. , The name which she drew, which
of course from her rate "must be that of a
State, was Ohio.- i
The resolution of Congress referred to
was passed the second session before and
provided that vessels of war then "build
ing or hereafter to be built,* should be
named by the Secretary of the Navy,
under the direction of the President of
the United States, according to the fol
lowing rule, to- wit: The first. class shall
be called after the States of the Union;
those of the second class after the rivers
and those of the third class after the prin
cipal cfllesand towns, taking care that no
two vessels in the navy have the same
name."! ? Â¦
This rule was~followed up to and after
the Civil "War, but since the inception of
the new navy the names of rivers have
been dropped and those" of the larger
cities* bestowed upon cruisers such as the
New York and the Brooklyn. ' \
YARDS SHOULD ALL
BUILD WARSHIPS
Naval Shore Stations Are
Equal in Rank to Pri
vate Concerns.
The increase of the "shore establish
ments of the navy has more than kept
pace with the growth of the material
afloat, and the sums Asked for the im
provement and maintenance of the shore
stations are yearly Increasing at a rate
that Is likely tp- cause Congress -.to con
sider the advisability of limiting the de
velopment to the most important.. The
Navy Department now . controls no less
than thirty-five" navy yards, naval sta
tions and coal depots, -and several more
of the' latter *have been recommended, in
addition to a naval station at Charleston
in lieu of Port Royal, which -latter is to
be abandoned. Of tins multitude of naval
establishments ashore only ten have facil
ities, of more or Ies3 extent, to build and
repair ships, of which the most prominent
are Brooklyn, Norfolk, Mare Island, Bos
ton, League Island and Portsmouth.. Vast
sums have .been expended on permanent
improvements and plants at these yards
during the'last fifteen years. and their fa
cilities are up-to-date, but at the same
time money has been wasted in building
up other stations of no other than polit
ical utility for years to come. "Modern
ship yards require millions of money to
make them really useful and the appro
priations have been divided among too
many, objects when better results would
have followed by putting, a few yards in
firsto-class condition.
The only navy yard on the Pacific Coast
âMare Islandâ is beyond doubt admirably
located, considering its strategic andeco
nomlc points, and no other navy yard in
the country compares with it in pictur
esqueness, extent and future, possibilities.
Years ago naval officers were reluctant to
serve at the station, it being considered
as punishment and exile, but with ! the
elimination of political chicanery, the in
troduction of civil service reform and con
sequent improvement in the public service
Mare Island Is eagerly sought for, by offi
cers as a relaxation from the sweltering
summer and rigid winter of the Atlantic
seaboard States. >r_ \
The changed methods In navy yard ad
ministration have likewise had a, bene
ficial effect upon the city of Vallejo, the
home of the Mare Island workman. Its
population has increased about 50 per
cent during the* last decade, large num
bers of attractive homes have been built
and the brief spasmodic periods of activ
ity in the yard, with consequent precari-
MONTANA SMELTING
CONCERNS ARE CLOSED
ous existence of mechanics and laborers,
have passed Into history. There Is now
steady employment for an average force
of 1600 men, resulting in a training? of
bona fide mechanics, whose services are
of benefit to the State and the country at
large, and there ia no other navy yard
town- in the United States showing ao
good results as the Government expendl
tures~at Mare Island. The importance of
that yard was plainly shown during the
late war, when It stood Second In the
amount of money expended upon repairs
of vessels, the figures being: New York,
$917,797; Mare Island, $552,564; Norfolk,
$465,916. The bureau of construction ex
pended from March, 1838, to July 1, 1S90,
$1,407,633 In fitting Out vessels for commis
sion and on repairs and alterations of
ships at the three yards above mentioned,
distributed as followa: Mare Island, $683.
362; Norfolk. $487,824; New York. $236,447.
The utility and Importance of Mare Isl
and has been demonstrated time and
again, its reputation for good and eco
nomical work has been established, and
the only excuse advanced for not pushing
its completion toward a real first class
yard has been the somewhat vague asser
tion that its approaches lacked sufficient
depth to allow battleships and other deep
draught vessels to proceed with safety to
the yard. In view of the fact that ships
drawing 28 feet/are- almost daily passing
to end from Port Costa, and that coal
laden vessels drawing 27 feet have dis
charged cargo at Mare Island, it would
seem that the Oregon and Iowa, drawing
less than 24 feet, should have no difficulty
in going to the yard. Besides, dreuglng
has been in. progress over the shoals com
plained of. and the reasons for not send
ing these ships to Mare Island, where
they could be repaired at less cost than
at a private yard, is probably due to the
efforts of contractors and to the reluc
tance of officers to forego the superior
social and other attractions of San Fran
cisco for those of Vallejo and the re
straint from the commanding officer of
the navy yard. , -
Tho contractors have practically monop
olized the construction of the new navy,
which has thus far resulted in building
up Important industries, but the time ia
approaching when It would be economy
on the part of the Government to utilize
its costly plants for building ships. Thera
is no reasonable excuse whatever for giv
ing out repair work by contract, for the
navy yards can do it better and cheaper
than a private yard. On two occasions of
recent years Mare Island has done new
work at 50 per cent le3S cost than demand
ed by a San Francisco firm, the 100-ton
shears and the new caisson at Mare Isl
and being the objects referred to. Then,
again, there is not a vessel built by con
tract which has been delivered when due,
not a dollar has been collected by the
Government of the penalties forfeited by
failure of contract stipulations, while on
the other hand several millions in pre
miums have been paid and there are- now
claims against the Government for about
three million dollars alleged to be due to
contractors, which will no' doubt be paid.
These incidentals added to the original
contract cost would more than wipe out
thty assumed greater cost of navy yard
work, and as the great contracting firms
of the country have reaped a harvest in
IÂ»rior contracts and become self-support
ing It would be good business and policy
on the part of Congress to let the navy
yards get a share of future navy building
and so allow the money to get into the
hands of mechanics and others without
the intermediary middleman.
It is no doubt a part of the programme
of contractors so to divide the appropria
tions of Congress as will give them an in-*
definite control of navy building, and to
that end money is expended upon a num
ber of stations, none of them receiving
any permanent benefit and none of the
yards making any appreciable advance
toward becoming national workshops. It
is this policy which has created such em
bryo naval stations as Port Orchard, Port
Royal and other money absorbers, naval
stations by name only.

opinion upon certain occurrences that

opinion that the Los Angeles delegation

LONDON, May 18.â A remarkable state
of affairs of the Servian royal family was
revealed by official telegrams from Bel
grade to-day. The Vienna newspapers In
February announced the accouchement
of Queen Dragha, who was married
August 5, 1900. This was shown to be un
true. Recently the same papers reported
that she was about to be confined. As the
Czar was one of the attesting witnesses
of the marriage, he sent a special Russian
envoy to Investigate th% strange affair.
The envoy summoned a trio of Russian
and French specialists, who declared the
Queen was not enclente. and an official
notification to this effect was sent to the
diplomatic corps.
The diagnosis of the doctors, however,
does not seem to have satisfied the royal
family and two specialists have been sum
moned from Vienna and Bucharest to re
port on the case. Costly gifts have been
pouring Into Belgrade from the people of
Servla in anticipation of the expected
event. The city of Nisch presented to the
royal couple a beautiful cradle.
' Scandal Becomes Inexplicable.
The Servian scandal becomes still more
Inexplicable. According to the Vienna cor
respondent . of the Daily Telegraph the
doctors attending Queen Dragha have is
sued a bulletin declaring that "the case is
peculiar, and it Is not impossible that the
Queen is only in the fourth month of her
pregnancy." '. v
The Vienna papers last night reported
that Queen Dragha was seriously ill, with
several physicians in consultation, and
that the case would require protracted
treatment.
The foreign explanation of the situation
In the Servian royal family may be regard
ed as authentic. The physicians have
presented a written statement, according
to which there is no immediate prospect
of, Queen Dragha's accouchement. She la
"certainly not in an advanced stage of
pregnancy, such as would have been tho
case had the opinion given last September
by Dr. Coulet. the French physician, been
correct. The physicians* proceed to ex
plain that Dr. Coulet may have been cor

be prepared for any emergency In con
nection with the threatened general strike
and also to prepare the report to the
biennial convention at Toronto on Juno;

from Boston, New York, Chicago, To
ronto and Sioux City. They will act In
both advisory and Judicial capacities dur
ing the threatened strike and will be in'
readiness to send out \ men to various
cities where executive officers may be
needed to manage the local situation.
President O'Connell said there was.no
possibility of averting the general strike.
From the statements of the executive
board it develops that the greater trouble
is expected at Cincinnati, San Francisco
and the Northern Pacific Coast cities." J;
J. Donnelly, the Boston representative on
the board, says there will be very little
trouble In New England. Hugh Doran of
Chicago says there will not be over 500
men on strike there. "We have just ad-
Justed the trouble there with the Illinois
Central Railroad," he added, "and a uni

throughout the system for machinists and

To the uninitiated a few Â¦ words explanatory,

More than a quarter of a century ago our

man in that country. Such being the - case It

In the majority of craftsâ both skilled and

a decade . of education, and they have ton-,

asked to come to Washington to conduct
the funeral services here.
During their residence In Washington
Secretary and Mrs. Gage have taken quite
an active part In social life at the capital.
Mrs. Gage was a woman of charming per
sonality and with her husband delighted
In extending the hospitality of their ele
gant home on Massachusetts avenue. Mrs.
â¢ Gage was probably " closer to Mrs. Mc-
Klnlev than any other of- the ladles of
the Cabinet.
\f \T WASHINGTON, May 17.-Mrs.
Vl i\ / Lyman J. Gage, wife of the
\V \V Secretary of the Treasury,
V V died at her . residence, 1715
Massachusetts avenue, North
west, at S:30 o'clock to-night, after an ill
ness of nine weeks' duration. With her
when the end came were her husband,
her married daughter, Mrs. E. F. Pierce
of Evanston, 111., and Dr. W. W. Johns- .
ton, the attending physician. For a time
before her death Mrs. . Gage . suffered
much pain, but she maintained her bright
and cheerful demeanor and was conscious
to the last. Â¦ Â¦ .
â¢ Heart trouble, the result of grip com
plications, was the immediate cause of '
death. Mrs. Gage was exposed to the
Inclement weather for about an hour on <
Inauguration day, but at the time her 1
health did not seem to have been affect- i
ed. On the 11th of March she left here 1
for Evanston to visit her daughter. While 1
there- she experienced a chill and took to <
her bed, but soon recovered sufficiently 1
to return to Washington, where she had i
been confined to her room ever since.
Mrs. Gage was a native of Albany, N. i
Y., and 58 years of age. She was married 1
to Secretary Gage in Denver in 18S7. ]
There were no children from their <
union, Mrs. Pierce being a child 1
by a former husband. The re- :
mains will be interred in Rose Hill Cem-
etery, near Chicago. Further than this
the funeral services have not been ar
ranged. It Is probable, however, that re
ligious services of a simple character will
be held at her former residence In this
city on Sunday morning. In which event
the body will leave here by the morning
train for Chicago.
Mrs. Gage was an Episcopalian in her
religious belief, but during their residence
here she and the Secretary have had a
pew in the Metropolitan Methodist Epis
copal Church, where the President at

most dangerously 111. Later Secretary Hay
received a telegram Informing: him of the
death of Mrs. Gage, and he at once noti

Cabinet soon after received telegrams
Informing them of the sad news.
President McKlnley sent a telegram of
condolence to Secretary Gage, In which
he expressed the deepest sympathy. The
Cabinet officers also sent 'dispatches of

Father Phillips was pastor of St. Ga
briel's Chi-rch, this city. . He was Born In
1851 at Hawley, Wayne County, Pa.,
where his father worked in the mines. He
attended the public schools at Pittston
Pa., and finished his studies at St.
Charles College. Elllcott City, Md.,'and St
Charles Theological Seminary, Philadel
phia. He was chained to the priesthood
In 1875. He was located *!n various parts
of the Scranton diocese, coming to Hazel
ton four years ago. Recently the twenty
fifth anniversary of his elevation to the
priesthood was celebrated here, and a
large number of priests and Catholic dig
nitaries from the surrounding country
came to Hazelton. to do him honor
- Father Phillips was a prominent mem
ber of; the Ancient Order of Hibernians
and the Elks lodge of this city. He took
an active part in settling the Hibernians'
difficulties . a few years ago. He was a

Work in the Coal Fields.
Father Phillips Did Much ' Noble
Stanley had a good-sized account at the
California Bank in this city. He had a
number of drafts for large amounts sent
to him from the East during his stay
here. The account was closed two years
ago.
TBTJE FRIEND OF THE MINERS.
Stanley was a heavy drinker, a fre
quenter of dissolute resorts and he
dressed to the limit of ultra-fashionable
demands. Always supplied with money,
he cut a dash into the inner, circle of
sportdom on the east side of the bay.
Withal.. however: he was never known to
talk of his past except in a most gen
eral way. After his sprees he would call
in physicians and to them Stanley said
he had come from the East with an In
sane patient, member of a wealthy New
York family, whose people were paying
liberally rather than have their relative
sent to an asylum or sanitarium. Â¦
Their child was a girl then about 8 years old.
She was In a private seminary during their
stay here. Stanley left the Lome ana went
to the Colonial at Eighth and Castro streets,
and later removed to Alameda. Finally the
party went to San- Francisco and that is the
last I heard of them.
Jax was always accompanied during "his
daily walks by an attendant who saw to it
that no one conversed with his ward. The
night we visited the rooms Jax seemed to be
laboring- under some extraordinary Influence,
yet he talked rationally and did not seem at
all desirous of leaving: the Stanleys.
Stanley and his wife told contradictory sto
ries concerning their connection with their
mysterious patient. Mrs. Stanley told us that
they were receiving $500 a month from his
mother to care for Jax. who was afflicted
with an incurable malady. Stanley said he
received only a small fee for the care of the
patient, but had ample Income of his own.
We found that the man that Stanley had
with him gave the name of Willis Jex. At
least this was the only name we ever eot
save that of Willis Jax, which Mrs. Stanley
said was correct. We went to the roomg at
the . Lome where they were staying-, and I
Bha.ll never forget the scene. Stanley un
doubtedly had some sort of Influence over his
patient. Chief Lloyd. City Attorney Dow, Dr
Mayon, then health officer, and myself, went
together one night about midnight. Stanley
received us, and after making known our
business he consented to usher us Into the
bedroom which his patient occupied.
In bed I saw a man about 40 years of age
rather dark, of medium size, with full, dark
beard. He conversed freely with us and said
he had been under Stanley's care for twelve
years. Jax was perfectly satisfied and con
tent with his position and there was nothing
he would complain about. After we departed
and held a consultation I was detailed to make
further investigation, but after many days
of work the department never secured evi
dence which would -warrant us in making an
arrest. Still we were satisfied that all was
not rijrht and that this 'Willis Jax was under
the undue influence of Stanley.
His wife was a demi-blonde, fair as her
husband was dark, tall and of queenly
figure. The pair were an attraction on
the streets.
Chief Lloyd and the present Chief of
Police. St. Clalr Hodgkins, who was then
a detective, went to work upon the case
Here Is Chief Hodgrkins' story of the
results:
The party hailed from New York. They
remained at the hotel five days and then
departed, taking apartments at the
Lyorne, a fashionable boarding-house on
Eighth street, west of Clay. It was a
few months later that the then Chief of
Police Charles E. ijovd received advices
from Isew York requesting information
about one John Houston, a wealthy East
erner, who was under the hypnotic con
trol of Dr. Stanley and his wife. It was
said that the Stanleys had been drugging
and mesmerizing their patient.
Before that Stanley had become a well
known figure about town because of his
striking presence and the remarkable
beauty of his wife. The doctor was
above, six feet In height, slender, with
Jet black hair and full black beard. With
square forehead, prominent nose and long
thin fingers, he was a very Svengali in
the real. There was a peculiar pallor in
his complexion, in striking contrast to
the beard of black and thick hair that
covered his head and face.
The career of Stanley began in Oakland
December 7, 1896, when he appeared at
the Hotel Crellin, where he registered his
party as follows:
Dr. K. Stanley, wife and child.
Mr. W. Jex and servant.
The story from Xew York recalls the
mysterious patient whom Stanley and his
wife guarded In this city with most jeal
ous care. It brings back to the minds
of those who were Interested in the in
quiry an uncanny reminder of a myster
ious man who was supposed to have
been either under hypnotic control or of
slow drugging, and was under the abso
lute domination of Stanley. This patient,
according to the information whem came
to the police, was the victim of the "doc
tor, being bled of money by Stanley,
who was reputed to receive $5W) a month
for his care.
OAKLAND. May. 17.â The police author
ities of Oakland are not surprised that
"Dr." Kirk Stanley should be placed in
a suspicious attitude in the case of' the
Rev. Edward S. Phillips in New York.
As much of mystery attended Stanley's
career in Oakland four or five years ago
as now surrounds the New York disclos
ures. That Stanley was not charged with
crime in this city was due to the inabil
ity of the detectives and the other offi
cials to find suffldent evidence to warrant
his arrest. That Stanley and his wife, a
beautiful creature, were not placed be
hind prison bars to account for a strange
occurrence was because the police found
It Impossible to lodge a charge against
the couple. Their extraordinary history
in Oakland has not been effaced from the
recollections of the police officials who
were called upon to investigate their con
duct.
Investigated by Police.
Mysterious Influence Over "Patients"
said that be went In there a number of
times, but never saw the body.
Suspicious Circumstances. â¢
The odor from the body was noticed by
the neighbors for several days. When
the detectives asked Stanley if he had not
detected it, he said he had and had made
inquiries about it. but thought it came
from a nsh market next door.
The detectives are in possession of a
photograph of the young woman whom
btanley identified as his wife. Kiernan
says that on last Thursday this woman
went to Stanley's house and tried to get
In, but finding it locked went down to the
rooms of Mrs. HIgglns, the Janitress. Mrs.
Higgins suggested that she could take the
duplicate keys and go up into the rooms.
According to Mrs. Higgins, the young wo
â¢Â£u threw "P her. hands and exclaimed:
?Â£.' I , cou } ( * not do that. I would not
& nk .v. of 5Â° lns U P Into tha t Place alone."
She then left the place hurriedly.
The picture of the young woman shows
her to be a rather good looking young
H Â« brew girl. Dr. Stanley refuses to toll
who she is. He says he is married, but
declares that his wife is living separately
in California.

CABEEB OF THE STANLEYS.
The police theory so far Is that the
priest died in Stanley's rooms, either aftor
having been drugged for robbery or sim
ilarly as a result of intoxication and ex
citement, and that Stanley was afraid to
notify the authorities, putting it off from
day to day. The body was found in such
a position, they 6ay, as to make it look as
If it had been carried into the room where
It was found from the larger adjo'-ilng
room, and there laid out. Detective Ser
geant Kiernan reported to Captain Titus
the statements made by Dr. Stanley and
the results of his investigations. Stanley,
he 'said, admitted he used mornhine. He
told: Kiernan that he himself put the bed
clothing from the window of the room in
which the priest was . found dead . before
he went away Thursday morning:." There
Is a pas jet in the room adjoining the one
in which the body was found. Kiernan
says that the light from this Â£hin?Â« di

would be impossible for any . person to
have gone Into the room, even at nisht,
without discovering the body. The doctor
A complete autopsy . was made by Dr.*
OHar.Ion, and it shows no marks of violence,
no fracture of any kind and no hemorrhage of
the brain. The conditions of the organs of
the body would indicate that death was due to
chronic nephritis and fatty liver. There was
eViouf a dram of dark fluid found in the
stomach, the character of which cannot be de
termined except by chemical analysis. Owing
to the suspicious circumstances attached to the
cas-.f It was deemed reasonably Just that a
chemical analypis should be made of the or
gans, -which will be sent to Professor Witthaus.
The matter now rests with the District Attor
ney and a. Justice of the Supreme Court to
determine whether that analysis shall be made.
Without their sanction it cannot be made.
â¢"How do you explain the pool of Wood?" the
Coroner was asked.
"That the doctor explains in this -way: The
body lying in a horizontal position enabled
tho pases which accumulated from decomposi
tion to force the blood through the mouth and
it trickled down to the floor."
Dr. O'Hanlon said:
The autopsy showed that the man suffered
from chronic Bright' s disease, fatty liver and
fatty heart. 'Â«ny of which would have been
sufficient 10 cause death. Of course he might
liave been given a hot bath and might have
been smothered. There were no signs of alco
holism in the stomach. â¢
Assistant District Attorney Garvan said
that he agreed with Coroner Bausch that
an analysis of the vital organs should be
made and said the District Attorney's of
fice would authorize an analysis. The
Coroner gave a permit for the removal of
the "body from the morgue to an under
taking establishment. Coroner Bausch
paid in relation to the missing- watch that
he was informed by H. H. McAnlff of
Wilkesbarre, Pa., the brother-in-law of
the priest, that the clergyman was seen
with his watch chain hanging out on the
night he was last seen alive at the Cen
tral Hotel, and that he believed the watch
was, taker, by pickpockets.
Father Phillips' friends salfi the body
probably would be shipped to the priest's
late home to-morrow. They expect to
make a lengrthy explanation of the priest's
acts. up to May 9. the day on which he is
supposed to have met his death. It was
learnt*! this afternoon that in addition to
the property already enumerated, as hav
ing- been, in his possession there was a
fjold pen and pencil, a silver glove but
toner and a silver Crucifix of the Holy
Cross Society, which has a branch in this
city.
Had Been. Drugged for Hobbery.
At the conclusion of the autopsy Cor
orne'r Bausch said:
In a talk with Coroner Bausch. Stanley
had said he met Phillips on the street,
talking with two girls: that he joined the
I>arty and invited them to his rooms; that
while there they all drank until the girls
left, and that afterward he and Phillips
were sick, but recovered after taking
some medicine that Phillips had with him.
Â¦'Do you know the names of the two
jcirls you say you and the priest brought
to your rooms on the morning of May
S?" the reporter asked Stanley.
"I do not, and I don't think I would
recognize them were I to see them again."
â¢'The police say the woman who lived
with you as your wife brought the priest
there that morning."
"That's a lie." he cried, excitedly. "She
was not there that day at all. We had
quarreled."
Result of an Autopsy.
The bodj' of Father Phillips was re
moved to the Morgue. Dr. A. F. Dougrh
rrty of 'Wllkesbarre, Pa., who says be Js
a nephew of the priest, identified the
body. He said Father Phillips had come
to the city to buy come statuary for his
church.
Coroner Bausch committed Stanley to
the Tombs in default of $10,000 ball to
await the result of the autopsy.
Stanley, in an interview with a reporter,
said:
"This Is terrible. I thought I had been
arrested for a debt of }8 I owed a Mrs.
Goldstein. I did not know the body of
the priest was in my room."
Identified by a Nephew.
Police Captain Donohue, after examin
ing the body, the rooms and effects of the
dead man. sent out a general alarm for
the apprehension of Stanley.
Shortly after midnight Stanley was seen
walking through Fiftieth street. "When he
came near to the corner of Ninth avenue,
half a block from his apartments, he
stopped. A policeman saw him. Stanley
caw the policeman at the same moment
and at once turned and walked rapidly
through Fiftieth street toward Eighth
aven,ue. The policeman ran after him and
touched him on the shoulder. He said the
captain desired to see him. Stanley ac
companied the policeman, and when he
reached the station-house was taken at
once to Captain Donohue's private office.
He and the captain were closeted together
for more than an hour. The captain then
took* Stanley before Sergeant Shible and
told the sergeant to lo$k him up.
The prisoner seemed to be suffering
from the effects of drink or drugs. His
manner was that of a man who was badly
dazed. He said his name was Kirk Stan
ley and that he had come to this city
abou,t a year and a half ago. He Bald
they called him a doctor, but he had no
diploma. He was a massage operator and
intended to open an office here.
Captain Donohue was reticent In dis
cussing the case. All that he would say
Â¦was ; that the prisoner had made conflict-
Ing statements. He had denied knowing
the man whose body was found In his
rooms and said he had never seen him
before and that he did not know there
was a body there until told by the police.
Stanley was arraigned in the Police
Court and was remanded to the custody
of the Coroner. He refused to make any
statement In court.
Arrest of Stanley.
Mrs. Bernius, from whom Stanley
leased four rooms, in one of which the
body] was found, says that her tenant
claimed to be from San Francisco and
called himself "Dr. Stanley." He was ac
companied by a young woman whom he
Introduced as his wife. The body was dis
covered by Mrs. Bernius* daughter, who
went Into Stanley's apartments to remove
some beddine which was hanging out of
the window. The police were immediately
notified, and a search of the body dis
closed a number of papers. Among them
was a letter from John Mitchell, presi
dent of the United Mine Workers, and
addressed to Rev. Dr. Edward S. Phillips,
Hazelton. Pa. There were also several
telegrams from Mitchell addressed to the
priest, a half-fare railway coupon such
as is issued to clergymen and several re
ceipts made out in Dr. Phillips' name.
It was made public for the first time
after the identification of the body that
two confidential alarms had been sent out
by Captain of Detectives Titus for Phil
lips, who, according to this information,
had been missing from his home in Hazel
ton since April 2S. The first alarm was
sent out May 8 and the second yesterday,
and detectives from the central office have
been quietly searching the hotels and hos
pitals in this city for the missing clergy
man.
Kirk Stanley, a massage operator, in
whoÂ£e rooms the body was found, is un
der arrest as a suspicious person. The
police believe that Father Phillips was
drug-ged and robbed.

OFFSETS TO EXPORTS.
DADABAHAI NAOROJI, an â¢ East Indian
financier, recently addressed to the Treasury.
Bureau of Statistics the question, "What has
caused so much produce, merchandise^. and specie of
the United States to go out of the" country without
the ordinary corresponding ireturn?" The reply given
by the chief of the bureau, which has just been made
public, reviews facts which are in a'/ general way
familiar to all Americans who have given any study
to commercial topics, but is interesting/because of the
detailed estimates officially made of the various off
sets to the balance of trade in our^fayor. . S
"Until very recently," says the chief'of the bureau,
"the main factors in offsetting American trade bal
ances have been the payment of interest on American
securities held abroad; the payment; of earnings of
foreign capital invested in business enterprises in the
United States; the payment of foreign freights car
ried in foreign vessels, especially freights on goods
imported into the United^States; and the expendi
tures of Americans traveling abroad. Within the last
two or three years, however, three further factors
have apparently been addedâ the cancellation of
American indebtedness abroad, including a return to
the United States of the railroad and other securities
thus held; the sale of foreign securities in the. United
States,, such as -the German, British arid Russian se
curities which were placed upon the markets here dur
ing the. last year, and in most cases quickly taken to
the amount of probably $100,000,000 in the year; and
the credits which now stand abroad in favor of our
exporters, and which are permitted to so stand be
cause better interest rates could thus be realized than
by insisting upon their immediate payment."
j -In considering the comparative values of the various
factors the chief estimates the amount paid to foreign
vessels as freights on imports at about $50,000,000; in
terest on and earnings of foreign capital, $75,000,000"
! to $100,000,000; " money expended abroad by Amerif
cans, $75,000,000 to $100,000,000; American funds in.-.
i vested in foreign securities in 1900, about $100,000,000;
1 and credits permitted to stand abroad in. 1899 and 1000,^
i each $75,000,000 to $ 100,000,000; to which must ,bV

canceled by the return of securities for which no defiv

WHEN the speculators in Wall street found
themselves-caught in that famous; lead pipe
cinch that carried' Northern" Pacific stock
out of reach of any one worth less than the Standard
Oil Company or the steel trust one speculator who
had contracted to deliver the stock applied to Judge
Gildersleeve for ari;-in junction, restraining those who
are supposed to have arranged the corner from, en
forcing the contracts. The injunction was granted,
but it* appears it is not to be pressed as the parties
have found means 'of settling the controversy out of
court.
It is to be regretted that the case has been dis
missed, for the trial would have been an interesting
one and might have established a principle of law that
would to some extent restrain the more unscrupulous
activities of the street. The grounds upon which the
application was made were stated by , the counsel for
the plaintiff as follows: "The proceedings were
based on the theory that at the time the plaintiff sojd
Northern Pacific short to defendants the latter knew
that they had a corner on the market and that they
held all the available stock, so that it wcmld be impos
sible for the plaintiff to deliver to them any such
stock, inasmuch as all the stock outstanding and
available was already in the defendants' possession.
Our theory was that such a contract was one which
the law would not countenance, and which not only
could not be enforced, but would be enjoined by the
courts." Â¦ . >Â¦
vlt will.be.,perceiyed<the point raised is one of,con
siderable force. All', reports from New!' York agree
that the, men'' who manipulated the Northern Pacific
deal" virtually- controlled ;'the available "stock. :. In v fact,'
before the cinch took place Russell Sage had pointed

A LOST OPPORTUNITY.
THE COMING GREEK.
THE President stands here in a physical environ
ment differing widely from the rest of the con
tinent. California has natural features not
found elsewhere even on this coast. This State is
nearest in its climate and unchangeable conditions
to that area that was made memorable by the rise and
confederation of the Greek tribes. That old land was
more Asiatic than European, and it produced a peo
ple that will influence the intellect of the world to the
end.
Here in almost identical conditions we behold a
European race transplanted in Asiatic soil.
It is a great physical truth that men are a crop
produced by the soil from which they grow. They
are as much a field crop as the fruit and grain which
share with us as tenants of the soil.
The crop of men grown in California will by
analogy of conditions be the Greeks of the future.
Their environment is already tending to that type.
The^ special flavor here of art and literature,, the in
tellectual precocity of the people, their spirit of ad
venture and enterprise, are all markedly Greek.
The President touches the hand of men in Califor
nia \^ho are of the type of Demosthenes, of archi
tects that are worthy of the Corinthian age, of artists
that are brothers to Praxiteles, \vriters that mentally
fellowship Xenophon, and satirists and dramatists
that are as keen as Aristophanes. . This Attic air and
scenery form and fashion the minds of the men. and
women of California, and our vices and our virtues
are Grecian. We may banish Aristides, but our con
ditions produce him. The noblest crop is to be cut
down, but it must first grow.
In our vices, our too apparent jealousies and exhi
bition of competitive tempers, too, are exactly Greek.
We can no more help these things than we can help
the fine tint of our skies and the fruitfulness of our
soil. Under them is a fine foundation of manliness
and generosity. -â¢ .
Indeed it is questionable whether perfection in
anything -is appreciated without a foil as its back
ground. So let our manifest envies and occasional
collisions of view be taken as the rugged, rocklike
formation of our collective character, on which grow
flowers the gentlest and the fairest
It will be evident to our visitors that we do not
yet understand ourselves. It is certain that the
Greeks did not, or they would not have banished
Aristides nor poisoned Socrates, nor forced so many
of their best minds and men into exile and not a few
of them into treason.
But seen in perspective, as to-day's California will
some time be, the Attic commonwealth is the finest
spectacle that the race has furnished since it emerged
into self-consciousness.
What we are, we have to be. Every drop of water
has to follow the stream, and not. one can turn against
the current, nor make landing to explore the valley
through which it flows. â¢
The whole of Californian life must move forward to
its united destiny, and when its mission is accom
plished there will be dedicated to the best uses of the
future the very excellent in art, literature, science and
character.
Draper and the evolutionists have demonstrated
that all life is ruled by the unchangeable physical en
vironment, and that even the religious idea is as much
a matter of climate in its origin as is the grass that
grows underfoot: .

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
It has been said that one of the great
est benefits resulting from the civil war
was the- paper money issued by and under
the supervision of the United States. The
notes thus issued, being comprised in a
few well-recognized designs, superseded
the thousand and one notes of every, con
ceivable design issued by banks scattered
over the entire country and of whose gen
uineness no one could tell. As ; a direct
result of the adoption of this , currency
there has grown up in the Treasury De
partment one of the largest manufactur
ing - establishments under . Government
control in. the world, known as the bu
reau Â¦ of engraving and printing.
Starting In a small way In the Treasury
building early In the .'60s, it now occupies
a building of its own upon a commanding
site on' the banks of the Pqtomac River,
in the shadow of the Washington monu
ment. This building has been twice en
larged since its original occupancy' in
1S80. The building and site represent an
outlay of $500,000, while the machinery;
and fixtures represent another outlay of
$1,000,000. It -employs 1010 : men. and 1336
women and expends; for wages' alone over s
$1,500,000 a year. The main work of this
establishment is the manufacture of the
notes issued by the Government and by
the national banks 6f the country, but it
also makes the . Internal revenue, cus
toms and postage stamps and all of the
checks used by disbursing officers of the
United States throughout the countryâ
in fact, everything that Is defined by law
to be an obligation or security of the
United States. As its main product is
coveted by every one, its principal aim
is to prevent an easy imitation of it, oth
erwise known as . counterfeiting. To this
end it employs all the processes of en
graving and printing that are most diffi
cult to imitate. ' It Becures ; the most
talented engravers, at. the com
pensation, and the most skilled printers
obtainable. - . - .
Preparing the Design.
When it is determined to issue a new
security of this kind the matter is dis
cussed by the officials having charge of
the several branches of the service in
volved, and the conclusions reached are
embodied in a "model made by a trained
designer, which is submitted for the criti
cism of the officers who aiscussed the mat
ter in the first place. The model -is then
modified in accordance with their criti
cisms, and is finally approved by the Sec
retary of the Treasury. One of the most
recent -instances or this kind is the new
silver certificates, of which the ones, twos
and fives have been issued, and which are
familiar to the general public The tens
are now in the hands of the engravers
and will be in circulation about July 1
next The new issue of postage stamps,
which will be known as the "commemora
tive series-of 1901," commemorative of the
Pan-American Exposition .at ...Buffalo, is
another recent instance. The designs of
these stamps are: One-cent, fast lake
navigation; 2-cent, fast express; 3-cent,
canal locks .at Sault Ste Marie; o-cent,
bridge at Niagara. Falls; 4-cent, automo
bile; lO-cent.-fast ocean navigation.
It is believed that these, designs will be
conceded, to. be. the handsomest issue .of
postage stamps ever made by the united
States, or, 1 in fact, . by . any government.
Preparing the Steel Plate.
The approved design is placed in the
hands of 'the, engravers for .the .^ution
of their respective lines of work-that- is,
vignettes, titles and work
When the engravers have finished their
work it is assembled upon a flat piece.Pf
steel, slightly larger than Ihe note or
stamp when seen in circulation, by the
tr Tnis e^s P aÂ° C me S thod of reproducing en
graving devised many years ago by Jacob
Perkins, an inventive American, who may
be considered the father of the present
method of duplicating bank notes. The
steel of the original engraving is har
dened artificially by. the Potassium pro
cess, and is placed on the bed of a press
known as a transfer press, and a. cylinder
of steel made artificially soft is passed
over the - original engraving under great
pressure/secured by the levers of this
sress, until air of the sunken lines of the
engraving are reproduced in relief on the
circumference of the' roll. This roir is
then made artificially .hard, and by the
same process the engraving in relief on
the roll is transferred to a soft PJecer of
flat steel, thus reproducing the original
engraving. In assembling the work of the
engravers to make the new note or stamp
th!*rolls from the original engravings axe
used to reproduce upon the soft steel tne
original work of the engraver, and when
that is completed we have : an re
production of the design of /the note or
stamp,on this piece. of .metal, which is
termed a die. This die, after all- of Its
lines are joined and finally -perfected by
an engraver, is hardened v i and? a roll ,1s
taken from it by the above described pro
cess and upon this- roll there Is a repro
duction of the entire note or stamp In
relief ' ' ~
' Custody of the Plates.
The plates, being finished and ready for
printing, are, together with all the dies
and rolls made by the bureau, placed^n
charge of an officer especially . appointed
by the Secretary, of the Treasury known
as .the custodian of dies,. rolls and plates.
They are , held by; this . officer in burglar
and fireproof vaults and are issued on^y
upon 1 the Secretary of the Treasury's mak
ing an order to print a certain definite
number of- f impressions from them. ,A
copy of this order Is promptly furnished
The paper upon which the impressions
are printed is distinctive and is made only
fcr the United States Government. The
distinctive feature of the --note paper,
known as fiber paper, is double lines : of
distributed silk fiber on the back of the
notes about two inches from each end
This fiber can be easily seen. The dis
tinctive features of the paper for. internal
revenue and postal stamps is a water
mark in the paper of the Â» letters U. S. . I.
R." 'for the first class and '.'U. S. P. S.
for the second ; class. This paper Is man
ufactured upon the order of the Secretary
of the Treasury and is held in the custody
of- the chief of the division of loans and
currency of his office.; It can only be ob
tained by the bureau . upon a requisition
setting forth the class, denomination and
value of the security to be printed there
on, and is charged to the bureau at the
full face value which can be so printed.
Every particle of this paper musj. be ac
counted for or the face value charged
against the bureau must be paid: In
money. . Â¦< Â¦'Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦ . . ., ! ' A '
Preparing for the Printing.
The finished plates now being in ,the
possession of the custodian of dies, rolls
and plates '.arid; the paper In the custody
of the secretary's office, when Unneces
sary orders are issued proper requisitions
are made, first . for the paper, and it; : is
transported from the Treasury building
to the bureau, checked with the requisi
tion and counted to . determine thafthe
actual number of sheets called for by the
requisition Is"; furnished. It is then pre
pared in the wetting* division for print
ing by being cpurited into sections of from
ten to twenty â¢ sheets each, . these sections
being subsequently placed between wet
cloths and. put; under . heavy weights -to
distribute 'the moisture from the cloths
evenly through" the paper.' When this has
progressed to. a certain point the weights
are taken off arijd the paper Is "shifted'*â
that is, each 'section' is' divided into three
equal portions, and^be- Inner or dry sides
are reversed and made the outer sides, 'so
as to place them -in-: direct contact with
the * wet ' cloths.' . â¢ They, \ are again placed
under, the, weight',- as ..before,- and, after
remaining, thus â¢ for ;hours the paper is .re
moved from *the wet cloths, counted , and
stacked , ready I tor. Issue Â« to the printers.
A requisition is now; made upon J the j cus
todian i of. dies,; rolls and: plates .for,- the
' necessary,- 1 , elates.'* 1 Theyv are 'delivered -to
and receipted for by a representative of
the printing division of the bureau.
Printing 1 Paper Money.
An assignment to printers is made. by
the chief of the printing division, and
each printer so assigned is given an or
der which entitles him to receive the nec
essarx plate and his assistant to receive
tho necessary paper in the quantity which
he may determine for his day's work.
The paper must be counted immediately
upon receipt as would money paid ata
bank, and a receipt must be given- The
printer and his assistant now become re
sponsible for the plate and the paper. At
tached to each printing press is an auto
matic device which records each impres
"sion printed. During the day, as impres
sions are completed in hundreds, they are
taken to the examining division' of the
bureau, where they are counted and
placed in the racks of the drying-room.
A receipt is given the printer for the num
ber of impressions so delivered by him. .
At 'the dose of the day the printer Is
required to return his plate and any un
printed paper, which is credited to him
on the books of the wetting division. A
comparison is then made of the number
of impressions charged to the printer. in
the wetting division with the number .of
impressions delivered by him to the ex
amining division. These three accounts
must agree. "When they agree the printer
and his assistant are relieved from fur
ther responsibility and the employes of
these divisions are dismissed upon a given
signal. ;
The freshly printed " impressions remain
In the drying-room securely locked dur
ing the night. At the commencement of
business the next morning they are taken
from the, drying-room and placed in the
hands, of expert examiners, who carefully
scrutinize them for imperfections in print
ing. Perfect impressions are counted and
made into . packages of 100 sheets, and
these are stacked into packages of 1000
sheets. The imperfect sheets are made
up into such packages as may be neces
sary.
Preparing Postage Stamps.
Finishing- the Stamps.
At this point there is a difference be
tween the treatment of notes and bonds
and that of .stamps. Notes and bonds re
quire more than one printing. The'print
ing above described Is for notes, the first
or green printing on the backs. The per
fect impressions resulting therefrom, are
placed in the vault to await their use in
making the second or face printing. The
ordinary postage stamps require but one
printing, and the perfect impressions of
these stamps are forwarded through the
remaining processes toward completion.
First, two sheets are placed back to back,
between smooth press-boards, and. in a
hydraulic press, are subjected to a press
ure of 1 5000 pounds to the square inch,
which reproduces the smooth, glossy sur
face of the paper that was lost in. wetting
and printing. They are then sent to the
gumming room, where gum is, placed upon
them by machines especially adapted for
that purpose. These machines are the
most improved gummirtg machines in the
world and were devised by employes of
the bureau. The gum is contained m a
fountain very much like the Ink fountain
of a Hoe press, in which is revolved a
glass roller. In revolving in the gum the
glass roller takes upon its surface a cer
tain quantity of gum, and when the sheet
is fed 'under it this gum is transferred to
f fhe surface of "the sheet. The sheet Is
then taken by grippers on an endless
chain and carried through a heated box
at a temperature of 125 degrees, and in
fone minute it is delivered at the other end
of the box perfectly dry.
From the gumming room the sheets go
to the perforating room, where the. large
sheets of 400 stamps, as originally printed,
are cut up into four sheets of 100 stamps
and the holes between the stamps are per
forated. This is accomplished on two sets
of machines, one cutting the sheet length
wise into two parts and at the same time
making tlfe perforations and the otlier
cutting crosswise the two sheets thus
made and at the same time making the
perforations.
After the cutting 1 and perforating 1 they
are pressed by placing the sheets between
mill boards and passing them under a
rotary press or calendaring: machine, sim
ilar to those used In paper mills, and then
they are carefully examined. on the back
and face, and all sheets containing 1 im
perfections in the gum or in the perfora
tions are rejected. This is an important
matter, as stamp collectors are very crit
ical and - exacting that . all stamps shall
be properly "centered," as they say â that
is that the margin of "white paper sur
ro'undlng the stamps shall be' equal on all
sides. The sheets are then passed to the
counters, and here the utmost care Is
exercised to secure accuracy of count.
The sheets are first counted by onÂ© coun
ter and her count is verified by another.
They are then banded and sealed, the
date and the initials of the counter be
ing placedi upon the seal, so that In the
LONG LIFE AND WORK.
SOME happy-hearted men in ; the; city of .New
York who enjoy life as a good thing have or
ganized a club for the, purpose, of . finding out
the causes which have enabled some persons to live
more than one hundred years. Up to this -time they
have found nothing more than -wide ; differences of
opinion. One set of authorities, maintain that long
life is most common among ignorant and unenterpris
ing people, while another set holds. to the belief that
intellectual exertion tends to prolong rife, and \that
in proportion to the numbers, of 'the two classes there
are more old men among the learned than among the
uneducated. * ; .'t> Â¦
The first authorities rely upon statistics collected
by a German medical journal from the census of va
rious nations. These show that- in countries where
illiteracy, and poverty are common there are pro-^
portionately many more centenarians than among
more highly educated and prosperous peoples.. In
Servia at the last census there were found in a popu
lation of 2,500,000 no less than 575 persons more than
100 years old, while in Germany, with a population of
55,000,000, there were found only 78. , '
The statistics collected in that way are scoffed at
by the advocates of , the opposing theory,- It is
claimed that the illiterates and paupers who assert
their age to be^n excess of 100 have no proof what
ever of their assertions. Educated people have few
centenarians among them because the record of their
birth is known and there is not the same opportunity
for errors or willful deception. Upon those grounds
the arguments .drawn from the census reports are de
clared invalid, and the solution of the question is left
to the investigation of cases where there 'is indis
putable proof of life* exceeding 100 years.
i 'in France there has been a careful gathering of
facts relating to the subject, but no evidence has been
obtained that confirms the view of either party. The
French investigators found about as many old people
proportionately in one class as in another. Some
were rich, some* were poor, some were learned and
some were ignorant, some lived temperate lives and
some were intemperate. In one case a man was found
whose birth record showed him to have lived 112
years, who was reported to have been an habitual
drunkard. Another attributed his 128 years to the
practice, of taking an occasional dose of gunpowder.
A woman of 124 says her long-life is due to her habit
of drinking large quantities of strong coffee. Finally,
a man enjoying life at 114 says he rarely eats anything
but fruit, principally melons, and continually chews
lemon peel. . ". â¢ -
..In such a mass of contradictions there. is no sure
guide to a system of long life. Perhaps the best way,
to attain more than 100 years is _not to worry- about
it. or" about anything else. Â¦'â¢Â¦ : - ; .;â¢Â«Â¦; )-âÂ¦-'-Â¦; ! h x ':':i- -;.'

GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
WE have endeavored to make it plain that all
sides of public ownership, or administration,
of public service industries should be con
sidered, studied and understood by every municipality
which proposes to adopt that policy.
Putting Government into business, making it a
proprietor of business plants and using it in their ad
ministration, means to introduce a very great change;
and it will be more likely to succeed if it come
against resistance than if it encounter none. Profes
sor James Bryce has said: "The greatest changes are
often introduced with the least notion ot their conse
quences, and the most fatal are those which encounter
least resistance."
, We have endeavored to develop the evidences of
the incapacity of municipalities for the administration
of a business. When a public service industry is in
private ownership the losses due to incapacity fall
upon its stockholders. When it is in public owner
ship the loss falls upon the taxpayers. If only two
thirds of the water delivered and consumed in New
York City is paid for, by reason of the dishonesty or
incapacity of municipal < administration, the cost of
storing, conducting and distributing the third un
paid for by its consumers falls, upon the taxpayers.
As the investigation made by the Merchants' Asso
ciation in New York shows thaf one-third "the water
goes unpaid for, and that the municipal accounts are
so kept that no one can tell what is due the city, nor
who owes it, it is seen at once that the cost of water
to the people of that city is not shown in the rate
paid by the consumers, but consists of what they
contribute as ratepayers and as taxpayers.
In Philadelphia . Mayor Ashbridge sought to
straighten out the municipal water accounts, and
found as far as he was able to go that for years the
city had been losing annually $800,000 in water un
paid for.* Of course that loss falls upon the city as
owner of the plant, and has to be made good by taxa
tion of the people.
The Merchants' Club > of Chicago has investigated
the' bookkeeping and accounts of that city, and re
ports the result as "a revelation of wholesale mis
management, incompetency -and plunder," and that
the city is conducting its business "under conditions
that would have brought bankruptcy to any mercan
tile firm."
The club found a discrepancy of four million dollars
in the cost of Chicago's water supply, as shown by
two sets of city books, and also a variation of one
and a quarter millions in the sinking fund to meet
water bonds.
â¢The postat system is habitually referred to by ad
vocates of municipal ownership of public service in
dustries as a model that should be followed and proof
positive of the capacity /of Government for business.
It is continually proposed to' put savings banks and
telegraphs into the postal system. But Mr. Henry D.
Castle, auditor of the Postoffice Department, is not
an enthusiast for any of these plans. He says that the
postal savings bank and telegraph propositions are full
of pitfalls, and after an elaborate statement of the
difficulties of Government accounting and the im
possibility of checking losses says: "The obvious
conclusion of the whole matter is that the postal "sys
tem, being a purely commercial or financial enterprise
under Government auspices, is an abnormal function,
requiring special treatment and embodying peculiar
risks. The branches already in operation present
enough complications, defects and possibilities of per
version to warrant the strenuous efforts of the high
est wisdom for their immediate improvement. Until
its defects are remedied, and until progress on the
present basis can be more accurately forecast, the
statesman, the publicist and plain citizen may very
judiciously withhold countenance from plausible Inno
vations." -;; â¢Â¦'; -'.'Â¦"
Since that was published by Mr. Castle' last month
Mr. Henniker Heaton, in the English House of Com
mons, has called attention to the annual loss of Â£700,
000 in the English postal telegraph administration,
amounting to nearly $50,000,000 in the last twenty
nine years.
American advocates of Government ownership
point to the rates paid for telegrams in. -Eng
land by those who use the wires. But it is plain
that those rates do not l "present the cost to the peo
ple, who as taxpayers have contributed $50,000,000 to
the telegraph service. Had that vast sum been put
upon the actual users .of the telegraph it will be' seen
that the rates. must have been so much larger.as to
deprive American advocates of public administration
of business plants of their best argument.
to be any decline in the amount of money they ex
pend.". The drain in payment of ocean freight rates will
vanish as soon as Congress puts American merchant
vessels on an equal footing with i subsidized Euro
pean ships. The sums that go to pay interest on
European investments, in this country will 'diminish
from this time on, for we are now not only financ
ing our own enterprises but are^-lending money to
Europe. In a Â¦, comparatively short time, therefore,
Europe will have to meet our trade balances in some
other way than at present. The United States has be
come a creditor instead of a debtor nation, and the
change is going to make an enormous' difference in
the commerce and finance of the world.
event of a shortage being, claimed by a
postmaster the persons .upon whom the
responsibility rests. for such error may be
determined.
- The stamps are then taken to what is
known as the finished vault, Where a
stock of 100,000,000 1-cent stamps, 200,000,000
2-cent stamps and relative quantities of
other, denominations is constantly kept
on hand to anticipate requisitions from
Postmasters. The stamps are distributed
to Postmasters on the orders of the Third
Assistant Postmaster General, the utmost
care being taken to insure the greatest
accuracy in filling these orders. The Post
master at Chicago, for example, calls for
as many as 10,000,000 1-cent and 20,000,000
2-cent stamps a month. Smaller postof
fices make requisitions about once a quar
ter, and at these, quarterly, issues the bu
reau forwards by registered mail a3 high
as 1500 packages a day for. several days
until the 40,000 or more Postmasters of the
country receive their quarterly stock of
stamps.
Finishing Notes and Bonds.
We left the first printing of the paper
money in the vault drying and season
ing for use in the second or face print
ing. "When necessity arises a requisition
is * made on the vaultkeeper for the
number of impressions of the first print
ing needed, and they are passed through
the same manipulations that ; were de
scribed â¢ for the first printing. In due
course they are returned to the vault as
perfect impressions, having two printings
upon them. . .
It has been found that in thÂ» succes
sive wettings a ! considerable portion of
the sizing originally placed in the paper
is removed, and to' insure good wearing
qualities in the note it i3 desirable to
replace this sizing. To accomplish this
the sheets are now passed .through a
bath of paper sizing at a temperature of
135 degrees, by which they become thor
oughly saturated with the size. Then
they' are locked up over night in special
ly prepared iron safes, where the size is
fully absorbed into the fiber of the paper,
and the next morning they are. placed in
the drying room and thoroughly dried.
They are next placed, four sheets back
to back, between the smooth press boards
and subjected to a pressure of 6000
pounds to the sauare inch.
Numbering Notes and Bonds,
Then they are delivered to the number
ing division, where the edges of the
sheets are trimmed and they receive the
blue numbers at the lower left-hand and
upper right-hand corners. This number
ing is executed on special numbering ma
chines designed by employes of the bu
reau. The machines change the number*
automatically. Thi3 bureau was the first
establishment to effect this result, as well
as to adapt steam, power to the- operation
of such machines. Prior to that all num
bering machines were operated by foot
treadle. The greatest care must be exer
cised in the numbering of these notes to
prevent duplication or other, error, as
such errors might lead to uncertainty as
to the genuineness of the notes in the
hands of the people. To avoid this, In
addition to the care exercised by the
numberer, there is a special corps of ex
aminers of numbered work, who carefully
examine each number to determine its
correctness. Â¦
After this examination the impressions
are made up into packages of 1000 sheets
and delivered to the Treasurer of the
United States, where the blue seal is im
printed upon them. The sheet3 are then
cut up Into single notes and put into
packages of 100 sheets each, and in due
course of time they are. issued by the
Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer in
fulfillment of the liabilities of the Gov
ernment. ' . ' i^.
The stamps and aotes are now In the
hands of the people. What vicissitudes
they pass through we cannot tell, but
much can be imagined.

CLAIMS CHENEY
IS HER HUSBAND
Mrs. Cfceyney's story is an unusual one.
She avers that eleven years ago Cheyney.
who v.'us 'then in search of 'a fortune,
which he has since accumulated in follow
ing his vocation as a mining expert, called
Â«t her father's home in Plumas County to
learn the location of a mine owned by Mr.
XeviMes. Mrs. Cheyney, who was then a
miES <l f 15' years, says Â¦ she answered . his
knock at the ooor and directed him to the
mine. Ke stated, she says, he was afraid
he would Jbc unable to locate the prop
erty and requested her to accompany
him. WHlr the consent of her parents, she
f.ays, she did accompany him to the mine.
and or. the way, in response to his earnest
solicitations, entered into a relationship
with him which constituted a common law
marriage, '.which was later strengthened
Ijv a marriage contract, which Cneyney
drafted and both sicned.
Later. Mrs. Cheyney alleges, Cheyney
returned to thif city. He was not here
long\ she says, until he wrote her asking
her to come here and assume her relation-
Bbip as his wife. This she did, and for
> ears they lived together on Sutter street,
t-he avers. Finally, she continues, her
husUand succeeded In his occupation and
.accumulated a comfortable fortune. Then
lie established an envIaDie social position,
and this done reached the conclusion that
the little woman who had at least occu
pied the position- of a wife to him for four
years must be sent away and the rela
tionship which existed between them
broken off.
Induces Her to Go East.
In order to carry out this plan Mrs.
Cheyney says . Cheyney requested her to
po East for a time that he might ar
rarg^ certain financial matters, promis
ing that when he had accomplished this
he would join her. Though she says she
was suspicious, Mrs. Cheyney finally con
sented to go East, but instead of going to
a plax.-e which he had suggested, she says
she went to Ohio where his mother lived.
Instead of finding his mother well off,
she says she found the old lady living
alone and in poverty.
Then Mrs. Cheyney says she returned
to California and Â¦when Cheyney found
:-he was in this State he sought to avoid
her, but she finally located him and called
upon him to publicly acknowledge their
rela.tior:sHip. This, she says, he refused
to do. and though she is about to become
a mother he still refuses to publish to
the world" that Bhe has never surrendered
her honor and that he is her lawful hus
band and father of her child.
Mrs. Cheyney. who resides at 630 Mason
street with Mrs. Dr. Fraser, is repre
sented by Attorney George â¢ D. Collins.
Mr. Collins says that as Cheyney refused
to acknowledge his marriage there was
but two courses to pursue. One was to
sue Cheyiiey to establish the validity of
his marriage to Mrs. Cheyney; the other
to sue him for breacxi of promise and
cause his- arrest nn the felony charge of
seduction un^er promise of marriage, but
as the contract and letters established
the validity of the marriage in his opin
ion. Mr. Collins said he intended to first
establish its validity by the action for
maintenance just filed and then proceed
on other lines if circumstances which may
arise make it necessary.
Their Tirst Meeting.
â¢ *
Sarsr.el TV. Cheyney, min!r.g expert anl
promoter and a weii-known member of
the PaclCc Union Club, was made the de
fendant !n a suit for maintenance yester
day that d!sc!o?cs a romantic. If not sen

cnl years of his life The plaintiff In the
actlos is Mrs. Maud Cheyney, a pretty,
petite lady. She asserts that f=r eleven
years she has been the wife of. Samuel
W. Cheyney by virtuÂ© of a marriage con
tract entered Into between $hem a few
cays after -they met at the home of her
parents, 2Jr. and Mrs. Nevilles, In Plumas
Ccunty. before tfceli removal to Santa
Clara County, where they now reside.
Mrs. Cheyney alleges In her complaint
that she was deserted by .Cheyney on
April 5 and that though he Is in receipt
of a monihjly Income of $750 he refuses to
longer contribute toward her support. In
consequence she demands judgment for
permanent- alimony in the sum of $300 a
month.
Thougrli Mrs. Cheyney is in need of
iir.ar.oial aid she asrerts her action "for
maintenance Is more for the purpose of
i^tablishing the validity of her marriage
to Cheyr.ey, whom, s>he says, has repudi

ccrs proclaims that he simply picked her
up as any other xr.an might pick up a
woman to reap what enjoyment he could
from her youth und beauty without
thought of. marriage a;id Its incumbent re
sponsibilities. She first seeks to save her
cood r.arce-. her honor. Mrs. Cheyney says,
then if the court wills! that the man whose
name she bears should support her she
will be twice pltaseu. but first of all she
nest defend her good name, which, she

their relationship, has assailed.

CON WALSH GETS THREE MONTHS.â
Con Walsh, : a street orator, who has served

Mogan yesterday. Early yesterday morning- he
Â¦was arrested by Policeman Joy while drunk
and orating at Market. and Turk â¢ streets. "
Cannot Use Appropriation of
One Fiscal" Year in
Another.
.'-A resolution passed by the Board of Su
pervisors authorizing' the; payment * of $500
each to ; the four park panhandle Â¦ apprais
ers Is illegal, according to Auditor^Wells,
and consequently is of no force and ', ef
fect. That official/ said yesterday that: he
had made up his' mind to reject . the de
mands, but will first consult with his legal^
adviser. Reuben H. Lloyd, in order to for-"
tlfy himself with the legal points involved
in the case.; Â¦ ' . ' ..Â¦;"-"Â¦' Â¦
: The resolution, which was adopted by
the board" in the meeting: held on May 6
and ' approved by the . Mayor on May 8, '
provides that $2000 - be â¢ authorized" to, be
made out of the general fund "as a partial
payment to S. H. Kent, A.- J.. Baisch, O.
B. Martin and Henry C. Robinson for ser
vices rendered as, members of the board
of appraisers Â¦ for the extension, of the
park panhandle, each to receive the sum
of : $500, the . money having been set aside
for this purpose in the budget of 1900-1901.
-The specific ground of the -Auditor's in
tention to hold up the demands is that the
.charter expressly states that no indebted
ness incurred' in one- fiscal? year .shall be
paid out of the funds of another. The
work for which ] the . four appraisers de
mand payment was. performed in the fis
cal year 1899-1900.. The fact that the board
appropriated the' sum of $4000 in the bud
get of the fiscal year 1900-1901 Is of no
a vail,. says the /Auditor, as the charter
provision expressly- forbids such a pro
ceeding. . . ;.
"I have already informed Appraisers
Kent and Raisch-that I fail to see how I
can honor the demands authorized by the
resolution of the board," said the,Aud
itor. "It is very clear that an attempt-is
being . made to â¢ pay claims of one 'fiscal
year out of the funds raised in another,
and this is a palpable violation of the
charter.- These appraisers have already
received $10C0 each, and it looks as if they
/will have to be satisfied with that, as I
do not see how I can afford them any re
lief in the mattef."-

Charles H. Young, a rigger, appeared
; before Judge Mogan yesterday on a
charge of petty larceny. He stole eight
newspapers that had been stamped and
addressed from the top of a letter box
Â¦ at Market and Stockton streets about 11
. o'clock Thursday night. Special Officer
E. D. Murphy saw him and arrested him.
In court yesterday Young said he had no
recollection of what he had done, as he
v.as stupidly drunk. He offered to bring
. a number of witnesses as to his char
â¢ acter. and the Judge continued the case
till Monday.
ANOTHER fleet arrived from the
Islands yesterday. Â¦ A strong
northwest . breeze was blowing
and all the vessels took advantage
of it to sail in. At one time there
was just outside the lightship a ship,
three barks, a barkentine and a schooner,
all under short canvas and maneuvering
to be the first to make port.
The peculiarly rigged Olympic came in
over the bar ahead of her rivals, although
she did not make the best run from the
islands. She # is a four-mater and is
square rigged on the fore and main and
fore and aft rigged on the mizzen and
jigger. She brought up 38,878 bags of
sugar, and was twenty-seven days on the
voyage. The Olympic arrived at Hono
lulu partially dismasted. She was caught
in a heavy gale and lost her fore topmast,
jibboom, main topgallant and mizzen top
mast. The damage was repaired at Hono
lulu and the vessel came on to San Fran
cisco.
The second vessel to pass in was the
schooner Mary E. Foster with 27,785 bags
of sugar. She made the run in twenty
four days, but the barkentine Encore,
which followed her in, made the run In
twenty-two days. The latter vessel is in
ballast and was bound for Grays Harbor,
but put in here for orders.
The bark Himalaya, which arrived with
27,161 bags of sugar, made the longest trip
of the fleet. She was thirty-two days on
the run, while the Mohican, the last to
arrive, made it in twenty-four days. The
Mohican brought up 20,843 bags Of sugar.
The British ship Dynomene came here
from Acapulco in ballast. She -made the
run In the good time of thirty-one days.
The chances are that she will load wheat
for Europe.

VERY LENIENT
WITH HERLIHY
\ Supervising Inspector
Reduces His Sen
tence.
â Â¦ : â â¢
Pilot Jordan Censured for
Steering the Rio in a
Fog.
."Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢...Â¦ .Â¦
Captain John Benninghain, United
â¢ States supervising inspector of steam
vessels, handed down a decision yester
day in the roaiter of the revocation by
the United States local Inspectors of the
. license of Chief Engineer P. H. Herllhy
of the To-eck^d Rio de Janeiro. The local
inspectors. Captains Bolles and Bulger, re
â¢ voked Herlihy's license because the testi
mony showed that he had been guilty of
neglect of duty by failing to be at his
post on the morning of February 22, when
, the Rio tras wrecked.
Inspector Bermingham. also finds Her
â¢ Hhy guilty and approves of the conviction
by the local inspectors, but scales down
the sentence by revpking Herlihy's license
for three months only. The reason as
signed for this leniency is the . previous
good reputation of Herlihy, his poverty
and bis large family depending upon him.
for support. Captain John K. Bulger is
exonerated from the charge of prejudice
and his findings are approved.
Pilot Jordan is censured for his disas
trous attempt to navigate the vessel in a
Â¦ fog. In dealing with this phase of the
; subject Captain Bermingham says:
, Jordan Â«as then aad had been from the time
he boaided the ship the previous day right
fully ir. chartre of the navigation of the ehlp,
hence was not obliged to obey the orders of
Captain Ward. Caoiam .Ward could have re
' lieved him if he chose and. taken charire of .
the navication of the vessel if he- desired to
take 60 e-rt-at a responsibility, but he did not
: do it, therefore, in my Ju-Jgment, Â¦ when the
pilot proceeded without remonstrance and left
a mile anchorage to enter the harbor during: a
fog ar.d darkness he did so on his own res
ponsibility. â¢ â¢ â¢
At all e\-ents, the pilot was !n no way Justi
fied in leaving a safe anchorage, as he did,
and penetrating a dense tog during 1 the pre
vailing darkness of night. Therefore, with all
, due respect to the Pilot Commission which
Â¦ acquitted him, I am of the opinion that to the
' unsklUfulness of the pilot may be attributed
the disaster. Shipmasters frequently bring
their ships safely through the Golden Gate un
der similar Conditions and are complimented
for it by their passengers, but it is a danger
ous proceeding, especially 60 in a large vessel
like the Rio de Janeiro. â¢ â¢ â¢
The case of Herlihy is then commented
upon as follows:
The appellant Herlihy when giving his testi
mony Khowed that he had been well coached
and evaded many of the pertinent questions
â¢ put to him by the court as to his conduct on
that occasion. Had he and all his assistants
i been at their posts where the printed orders
of General llanayer Sch-vrerin positively re
quired them to be *he watertlzht door of the
bulkhead between the nreroom and the coal
bunkers could' have been, sooner closed, also
the hir.red door at the mouth of the tunnel
between the engine and boiler rooms could
â¢ jiossibly with more assistance have been closed
in the earlier stage of the water and without
endangering the lives of the people in the fire
: room. The closing of that door might have
kept the water out of the engine-room for a
Â¦ longer time.

We have never asked you to
buy COTTOLENE because it is
cheap. We want you to buy it
because it is the best shortening
and frying medium produced. It'
makeir "the ; most delicious ' and
wholesome biscuits, crusts, muf-'
fins, cakes, etc.,; that ever de-
lighted hungry man.
Nevertheless, there is economy
in using it, as you require gorily
two-thirds as much Cottolene for
shortening as you do of lard, but-
ter" or any other cooking fat.
Th'eh isn't it wasteful not to use

Hon. F. B. Doran, who has been several
times honored by the citizens of St. Paul
by re-election as mayor, possesses many
of the characteristics that go to make
the reputation of a "sound man," and is
the last person in. the world to publicly
indorse anything of which he has not ful
ly Informed himself.
Mayor Dorany decided to take Palno's
celery compoimd this spring, having
heard much of Its wonderful efficacy from
physicians, neighbors and. intimate
friends. He was not disappointed. His
experience with this great remedy waa
so gratifying that a-few days ego he sent
the proprietors a testimonial which adds
conclusive proof to the statement of phys
icians that, of all the spring remedies that
can bo had, Paine's celery compound
stands far above all others in honest and
great results: â¢
March 21, 1901.
Dear Sirsâ I am convinced that every
one, stele or well, needs to take a spring
remedy, and for that purposo I believe
nothing can equal Palno's celery com
pound. I commend It to the
nervously afflicted. Very truly rours,
J : V< ""** P. B. DOR AN.
New strength, new life, new health com*
from its useâ especially Is this true In thÂ«
spring. , **
For rheumatism, neuralgia, Impure
blood, nervous diseases and kindred trou
bles, It Is a positive cure. The expert
mental efforts of scores and scores of so
called spring remedies with which tha
market Is constantly recruited art In
startling contrast with the thoroughly sci
entific way In which Palne's celery com
pound restores health and vigor to thÂ«
worn-out blood and nerves.
But as age comes on the blood needs to
be rid of rheumatism and the muscle.* of
neuralgia; the nÂ«rves needs feedine and
the brain nourishment. Palne's celery
compound la food for the brain and
nerves. It builds up the strength of the
body. The saddest ignorance is for a sick
person not to know the remedy that will
make him well. Fortunately, few people
have failed to hear of the remarkable
cures from the use of Palne's celery com
pound.
Because a man is growing old he need
not be an invalid. Old age isn't a disease.
A man at sixty should be Well, and many
at seventy are as well as ever in their
lives. j '.?+VkX

Ing. In addition to the toasts a clever
and entertaining programme of musical
selections and stories had been arranged.
Robert Downing, the tragedian, told in
teresting anecdotes and William McDon-"
aid, formerly of the Bostonlan Opera
Company, John k Flood and F.red Everett
sang. John Holland, the comedian, re
cited and told funny yarns that elicited
repeated rounds of applause.
Harry I. Mulcreavy delivered an address
of greeting and Introduced Oscar Hocks
as the toastmaster of the evening. Mr.
Hocks presented Dr. Littlefleld, who re
sponded to the flrst toast of the evening,
"Our Order," in a graceful speech. In
conclusion the if rand, worthy president
cited statistics showing the phenomenal
growth of , the order from sixty-three
aeries one year ago to 156 at the present"
time, and the prospective organization of
eight more during- the current month. In
a feeling manner Dr. Littlefield thanked
the Grand Aerie for the honors conferred
upon him in the past, and eat down amid
vociferous strains of "He's a Jolly good
fellow."
John J. Kennedy, responding â¢ to the
toast "California," made a most eloquent
address. He likened the pride the native
sons of California feel in their State to the
delight and pride they felt In honoring
members of tliÂ» Grand Aerie as guests of
the local aerie.?.
Perhaps the most Interesting: toast of
Beautiful Scene in Banquet Hall.

Palace Hotel. But above these fellowship
and all that goes to emphasize the spirit
of brotherhood was the ruling passion of
tho hour. Never, even at the height of
revelry and mirth, did tho representatives
of the powerful and growing order they
represent forget the fraternal sentiment
of the gathering or fail to refer and re
spond to it In the many graceful and elo
quent addresses that made the set feat
ures of the banquet. # '
More than two hundred Eagles from all
parts of the country filed In to the five
tiers of tables elaborately decorated and
covering the whole floor space of the
maple room of the Palace. At the head
of the line walked Dr. H. R. Littlefield,
grand worthy president of the Grand

ident of San Francltfco Aerie No. 5. Next
in the line came Dr. Thomas B. W. Le

No. 61, with Past President Sheehan of

The banquet last night waa one of the
most enjoyable and elaborate ever given
in San Francisco. Those present were:
Mayor Fitzgerald of Pawtucket is one
of the most enthusiastic Eagles outside of
a coop. He Is a story-teller and general
all ground entertainer of rare gift. He
added greatly to the gayety of thÂ© ban
quet.
Senator Monahan of Philadelphia and
Senator Trainor of New York tried to fig
ure out between themselves the difference
between Croker and Quay. There. was a
deadlock, and they compromised over the
wine.

States," Del Carey Smith; "Golden Gate Aerie

Chief among ihe . tunmakers was Harry
Brenran, who had a "hard session" try-
Ing to get the ebon-hued knights of the
hatrack to, keep cases on the promiscuous
headgear. He did more. When the-visit
ing Eagles remember California hospital
ity they. must couple it with the gracious
ness and courtesy of Mr. Brennan. He
has added much to the success of the
greatest Grand Aerie ever held.
Toasts Responded To.
Other toasts' ref ponded to were tho fol
lowing:
the evening wnÂ» responded to by H. II.
Thompson, wh > may be called the pa
triarch of the order. Mr. Thompion 1*
eatit grand president of Aerto' No. 1 of
cattle, where the order had Its birth, and
in addition w&m for two terms grand lea
turer, a distinction nover beforo conferred.
In a touching way he told of tho vicissi
tudes encountered by the order during its
Infancy, the difficulties and persistence
necessary to bring It to a high standard
and a position of potent influence all over
the country, and he predicted a wondrous
future for tha order.

In practically all such cases where cof-
fee Is the drink one can obtain relief by
Icaviuc off coffee and taking Postum I'ood
Coffte, .for they Jcava off a drink that Is
an active producer of disease and tako In
Its place a powerful liquid food that con-
tains elements for rebuilding the nerve
centers, that have heretofore been torn
down.
Ae a rule people engaged in active phys-
ical work can better stand tho toxic eflect
of lh<s coffee than brain workers, who
have but little physical exercise. When a
mar. or woman finds sickness coming on,
such aÂ« stomach trouble, weak eyes,
bowel complaint, kidney * trouble, etc., it
Is timo some attention is given to the

"I had only used Postum a week when I
began to fee} well. My stc-mach began to
wcrk ajl right, headache left, and had no
more dizziness. I am able to eat now and
sleep end work. During the last season
I have been at work in the field, where
before I was not able to sweep out a
room."
Even people who work out of doors are
troubled with the effects of coffee drink-
ing. A German woman fn Egan, S. D.,
Mrs. L. Sengr, says that she did not know
what w,as the cause of her being sick and
miserable as she had been for some years
past. Her own words are interesting:
"I had no appetite, suffered considerably^
with headache and dizziness and was
ccmpelled to take some pills or medicine
regularly for my bowels. In this condi-
tion I lived for many years. It was poor
and dear living, as my doctor's bills will
F.how. I had no idea that coffee was the
cause of my 111 health until I read in the

The San Rafael Golf Club has engaged
as a coach a young Scotchman named
Bell, who comes from the same part of
Scotland as Robert Johnstone. the pro
fessional of the San Francisco Golf Club.
Bell has a good reputation as a golfer
and club maker and will be a valuable ac
quisition to the San Rafael Club. He will
remain there throughout the summer and
In winter will assist Robert Johnstone at
the Presidio links. Bell has come out di
rect from the land of his birth and early
training and has had no previous engage
ment In the United States.
To-day at 10 o'clock in the morning there
will begin on the San Rafael links a hand
icap over nine holes against bogie for the
women, also a best ball tournament over
nine holes for the women, play continu
ing until May 25 and ending at 6 p. m. on
that day. For the afternoon, beginning
at 2 o'clock, a team match among mem
bers of the club la set down on the sched
ule, but this has been deferred on ac
count of the launching of the battleship
Ohio. -
Last Saturday, despite the fact that
both clubs lacked some of their strongest
players, the return match between teams
representing the San Rafael and Sausa
llto gplf clubs took place, not, however,
on the Fort Baker links, but on the San
Rafael course, where the first meeting oc
curred. The Sausalito course Is so over
run with thistles and weeds that it is in
no condition for play, but it Is believed
that when the thistles have been subdued
and other improvements effected the
course will be a good one. It la certainly
a sporty one, the hole known as the "Boer
trap" affording as fine a group of natural
hazards as can be found anywhere. The
Sausallto team, nearly all the players In
which are comparative beginners, was
beaten, though C. F. Noble beat Carter P
Pomeroy, captain of the San Rafael Golf
Club, one up, and Major T. "W. M. Draper
scored two up against Major Charles
Christensen. ' â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦...
The residents of Alameda are desirous
to ' form a : golf club.' and two or three
meetings have been held with that end In
view. A long list of persona willing to be
come members <has been received, and a
committee appointed to inquire what land
suitable for- links can be obtained Sev
eral places have been suggested and* these
will be looked over by Horace Rawllns
the resident professional of the Oakland
Golf Club. The ground that seems most
likely to prove suitable is in the rear of
the Talcott property, near Frultvale A
meeting will be held in Alameda to-night

BLANK DAY FOR
CRICKET LOVERS
FOUR CLEVER BOXERS WHO
HAVE ENTERED THE OLYMPIC
CLUB TOURNAMENT.
The academic singles tournament com
menced last Saturday will be finished this
morning- on the California. Tennis Club
courts. The doubles were won by Nor
man Hodgklns and Carl Gardner, repre
senting: Lowell High School. Hodgkins is
a strong favorite for first honors in the
singles and unless something unforeseen
happens should win easily.. The only man
who seems to have any chance at all
against him Is Taylor of the Oakland
High School. Two matches have been
played, in which Valleau of Alameda High
School defeated Al Kenyon â¢ of Boone's
Academy, and Cavalier of Berkeley High
beat Bennett of St. Matthew's. .'
The drawing for the singles tournament
is as follows: Taylor, O. H.S., vs. Towne,
P. A. H. S.; Cavalier, B. H. S, vs Bennett
St. Matthew's; Valleau, A.- H. S., V3.
Kenyon, B. "W". A.;.HodBkinson, U H. S.
vs Lilienthal, P. H. S. -Hodgkinson and
Taylor will In all probability come â¢ to
gether in the finals. The standard of the
tennis this year is much higher than it
has been in former years In the Academic
League. â¢ / _. . . '., Â¦ 1 . . Â¦ â¢ * ..
! For many years the championship sin
gles tournament has been held at â¢ San
Rafael on the Fourth of July, but thls'year
there will be a great change In the order
of events. I This tournament will probably
be played along with the doubles : cham
pionship on the 9th of September. ' On the
Fourth of July there will be a singles tour
nament for the championship of the State
while the singles to be played in Septem
ber will be for the coast championship.
The singles championship for ladles will
also be played In September, and thero is
some talk of > holding a- mixed doubles
tournament at the same time.' :.. ..
The Hardys and WHltneys will probably
not take part In the State championship
tournament, -but will enter the â¢ coast
championship tournament. :- In" the former
event the tennis would . not ' be as high
class, but the interest would be greater on
account of the intense rivalry existing be
tween the- men. This would also be a
means of determining who should rank at
the top of the second class.. - ,.
This change of dates is due to the fact
that the men from the North and from
Southern California have signified tl:eir
Intention of journeying to San? Rafael If
the singles and doubles tournaments could
be run at the same time.- With thesenien
entered, the ~ tournament â¢ would -be' the

baseball with the local American League
olub. and' to enjoin the manager of that

missed by the Judges of the Common

contract lacks mutuality. The court says
if the injunction was granted La Joie's

SO successful was the last boxing
entertainment of the Olympic Club
that the directors of that instltu
tlon have laid plans for another
on the same lines. The last was
a coast championship affair and- brought
out the best line of young amateurs from
tno B mall and large clubs of > this and
nearby cities. Some new men came to
tno f rO nt, furnishing fistic eport of a cer
tain and fixed quality. '
The tournament which will take place
on May 22 and 23 will be up to the stand
ard. Some of the newcomers developed
ln the coast championship encounters wills
bo seen next Wednesday and Thursday
inside the Olympic Club ring 'to; better

Should this tournament prove thtÂ« suc
c( ss ' that Is nntlclputod It la tho Intention
ot t he Olympic Club to gather together
from the amateur champions a team iit
nntl capable to replif^ent tho West In tho
next national boxing, tournament held In
is likely that the famous "Midget" barge
crew will be made up again and will strive
to regain its honors in the senior class.
Last Sunday was a lively day at the
Ariel boathouse, two junior barge crews
and several scullers being out for prac
tice. The new junior four are W. Toung,
B. Brown. Aaron Hrown and W. Sherry.
Several of thÂ« members went over to the
rock on which the new boathouse will be
built and began work upon It. To enlarge
the base it is proposed to put down Iron
Â¦Dlpes filled with cexrtent. Several applica
tions have been received for membership,
and it is expected that a dozen or more
new members will be admitted at the next
meeting of the club.
The Dolphin Boating Club at Its last
mteting appointed a nominating commit
tee consisting of J. S. Earls, C. M. Far
rell, T. J. Kennedy, W. Fauser and W. O.
Patch. The club will charter a -schooner
on June 16 and sail about the bay, landing
at. Waldo Point, Sausalito, where a clam
bake will be given on the beach. In open
regattas A. W. Pape will" represent the
Dolphins in the shell, G-eorge Baker in the
sejiior skiff and Leo Wienand In the
Junior skiff. Efforts are also being made
to organize a junior barge crew, in which
Stanley Adderley will probably take the
feat vacated by E. A. Kragness.
Th*> prospect In the rowing world Is de
ciacaly brighter than it was, and there
ajiprar to be pood chances for an Inter
cMlnp regatta later on in the season. The
Merchant** Exchange committee of Oak
land, in charge of tho celebration on the
Fourth of July, neems to bo favorably in
clined toward making a rowing regatta
on Lake Merritt a leading feature of the
celebration on the national holiday. The
lako has been dredged, deepened and
greatly improved since the Pacific Asi-o
ciailon some years ago gavo a regatta
on Itf waters. There is ample space for
ppectators on the banks to view the races
In comfort and without crowding, and the
project Is awakening a good deal of inter
est .among the oarsmen of Oakland Creek.
The- University of California Boat Club
Â¦will 1 lend its aid. and may arrange a race
against the Columbia Rowing Club, the
quarters of which adjoin those of the uni
versity on Sessions Basin. The Univer
sity Club will shortly receive its four
oared shell from Cornell and will be anx
ious for a trial of speed. It will also send
contestants in for the outrigged skiff
races. The Alameda Boat Club has taken
up the idea with enthusiasm and devoted
a good deal of time to discussing It at its
last meeting. A committee consisting of
A. G. Bell, W. C. Donnelly and Captain
E. B. Thorning, to act In conjunction with
W.'B. Hinchman, president of the Pacific
Association, was appointed. The public
bodies of Alameda will be approached and
asked to aid in bringing the regatta about.
When matters are far enough advanced a
definite plan will be laid before the Oak
land committee. If the arrangements are
satisfactorily concluded by the end of the
present month the oarsmen will have five
weeks for practice before the regatta.
The South End Rowing Club has a good
deal of material for oarsmen Just now,
three junior barge crews having been or
ganized. The first of these consists of C.
C. L'-ennis, bow; Matt Harris, No. 2; J.
McGeorse, No. 3, and Emll Blumlein,
stroke. The second Is made up of H. Lar
sen, bow; J. P. Foley, No. 2; A. McDuffey.
No, 3, and Charles Jenkins, stroke. The
third is composed of E. Pallas, bow; F.
Msiyo, No. 2; J. Marsh, No. 3, and E.
Lyons, stroke. It 1* probable that two of
these three Junior fours will take part in
ai.y regatta that may be held during this
season. E. Scull j- has also organized an
intermediate barge crew. ' The existence
of several crews promotes interest among
the members, as it excites a friendly ri
valry and gives an opportunity for im
prcrcptu trials of speed. It is thought
that Larsen will prove an acquisition to
the South Ends, as he has had consid
erable practice in rowing at Portland. The
South End Rowing Club Intends to make
an application to the board of managers
of -the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union for the reinstatement of
Robert McArthur as an amateur on the
grounds that he has for a long time taken,
no interest or share In professional sports
and has been under the ban long enough.
If the application is successful and Mc-
Arthur recovers his amateur standing it

To-day and to-morrow are open days on
the programme of the Corinthian Yacht
Club. The San Francttco fleet will crulM
to PariuUrto Cove thbt evening, will an
chor there for the night and return , to
morrow on an ebb tide. The California
Yacht Club has a cruise to Vallejo on
Its schedule for to-day, but will postpone
It so as to enable Us members to see the
launching of the battleship Ohio. Next
Saturday the Corinthians will cruise to
1'etaluma drawbridge, returning to their
moorings on the following day.
The crulao of the San Francisco and *
Corinthian yacht clubs to Vallejo last Sat
urday was very successful, the boats mak
ing excellent time with a fair wind and
flood tide. G. E. Billings' .sloop Nlxle
made the trip from Sausallto to the navy
yard In 2 hours 45 minutes, and the sloop
Cygnus, a smaller and slower craft, ac
complished it in the good time of 3 hours
25 minutes. About a score of Corinthian
boats and nine craft flying the San Fran
cisco burgee lay at anchor In Carqutnez
Straits on Sunday morning. The San
Francisco yachts started across the line
between the launch America and tee re
ceiving ship Independence at 9 a. m., the
Corinthians waiting till a somewhat later
hour. The trip down was an unusually
pleasant and fast one. there being a good
breeze and exceptionally smooth water in
San Pablo- Bay. The fastest trip waa
made by the sloop Nixie, whose time for
the twenty-six nautical miles was 3 hours
It minutes 15 seconds. Interest in the
race was considerably lessened by tho
fact that none of the big schooners ex
cept the flagship Ramona took part In
the event. H. R. Slmpklns' yawl Tramon
tana being also absent. In the smaller
class Vice Commodore R. S. Bridgman's
sloop Thetis made the best sailing time,
but the flag went to P. de Martini's sloop
Siren on time allowance. The remarka
ble feature about the sail down was the
long lee the boats were able to make,
keeping on the port tack from the Mare
Island light right down to Marln Islands.
Off Paradise Cove some craft of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club were seen.
The California Yacht Club cruised last
Saturday to Lone Tree Cove, Angel Isl
and, where they anchored for the night.
Among the yachts that made the trip
were Vice Commodore Charles B! Clark's
yawl Gypsie. Port Captain Allen M. Clay's
sloop Pactolus, Measurer John T. i Car
rier's sloop Jessie E, Shaw and Martin's
yawl Idler, R. F. Millar's sloop Lapwing.
Kendall. Greene and Vincent's sloop Alert,
and S. and L. I. Gale's sloop Secret. Com
modore S. S. Marshall's sloop Thelma was
not on the cruise, as she has not yet been
repaired since her collision with the
freight steamer Transit. The railroad
company, after an investigation of the
facts connected with the collision, has de
cided to admit Its responsibility for the
mishap and to pay the whole expense of
repairing the damage.
The,ValleJo Yacht Club house is mak
ing slow progress, but this 13' accounted
for by the fact that it is being built by
the members and not by contract. W. J.
Wood of the sloop Angela has retired
from tho office of commodore, and the
following board of directors has been
elected: Commodore, Charles : Chapman:
vice commodore, A. P. Noyes; port cap
tain. G. H. "Warford: secretary. "W. A.
Kirkland; treasurer, T. V. Collins; meas
urer, Matthew Turner; members of board
â G. Wenlger, F. R. Devlin, P. Rock., A.
Hammer, D. Barry; regatta committeeâ
J. Â¦ E. Lowney, W. D. Callan and- "W.
White. The . clubhouse is being built on
piles right out in the water and can only
be approached by boat. When completed
it will be a great convenience to yachts
men from the city cruising 1 to Vallejo,
supplying a place where oars, oarlocks
and other equipment may be left In safe
ty. It is not yel known whether the Val
lejo Yacht Club will join the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association, which requires
a membership of three yacht clubs to'
maintain its existence. At present only
two clubs, the . San Franclscos and the
Corinthians, are members, and of these
'two only 'the Corinthian Club has ap
pointed the three delegates to- the asso
ciation. As the prizes offered by Com
modore J. M. Macdonough and Herbert
E. Law will lapse if the association goes
out of existence and no new one is formed 
to succeed It, It behooves those who are
interested In maintaining an annual re
gatta, open to all recognized yacht clubs
on the" bay, to bestir themselves.

recede to 5 to 2, and r the- smart ones un

on Carlo caught B. C. Greene below tWe

judges two lengths to the good. Armado
acted rank, and a delay " at the post did
not Improve his disposition. . ' .
- Such a warm tip permeated the ring
and paddock on Malay that those who
fancied Gauntlet got as good as 7 to 5
against their money. Malay -was found
wanting, for Ransch on Gauntlet took the
lead when ready,' winning very cleverly
in 2:08. Stromo ran a fair third, eight
lengths before Vohicer. â
In the hustle to back Vasallo to win the

neglected except possibly Royalty. At the
start Alexander rushed Escalante, a 12 to

was desperately urged' by Bassinger the

Ing of the soil Is needed to make It ready
for seeding. The purpose of this planting
will be to see how quickly a crop. of hay
can be obtained from the new land for
the sustenance of the large number of
horses and mules in the various camps
which are at work constructing the sub
sidiary canals and laterals. A carload of
sorghum seed is going out . to the land
early next week, andi several other cars
of grain for similar purposes are being
contracted for.
The big canal has a carrying capacity
for sufficient water to irrigate 250,000 acres
of land, and as there Is about that much
land waiting for the water it will not be
long befqre two parallel canals will be
constructed with almost equal capacity.
The company has unbounded faith in the
project and has constructed Its works on
the theory that success is certain. The
soil, of unknown depth. Is rich almost be
yond comparison, being formed of the sed
iment which -has been brought down by
the Colorado River through countless
ages. The immense growth of -wild grasses
during the short seasons of rain and over
flow; which occur sometimes yearly and
sometimes every two or three years,
proves what the soil is capable of produc
ing.

While the headgates have been building
the water was allowed to reach the canal

he was hoisting from the 1500-foot 'level,

the spot where a number of workmen had

mine was shut off except through the

LOXDOK, May 17. â The consular report
of the foreign trade of Japan for 1900 em
phasizes the baleful effect upon trade of
the scarcity of money and . the abnormal
expenditure, upon unproductive works,
leading to an excess of Imports over ex
ports amounting to Â£8,500,000 and a conse
quent drain on specie, which foreign loans
could only temporarily relieve.
The United States, says the report, con
tinues to encroach on spheres of crade for
merly considered under the exclusive con
trol of the United Kingdom and other na
tions. American importation of raw cot
ton doubled in 1S39, giving America the
lead, while British India imports dimin
ished one-half.
The report refers to the Increase of im
ports of Araierican kerosene and the great
development of the Echigo fields with
American machinery, largely under the
auspices of the Standard Oil Company.
The Consul attributes the success of
Americans to their willingness to extend
their plants and rush orders to meet Jap
anese demands. â¢
The report says that though there Is
considerable talk of trusts, only a coal
combine was materialized, the conditions
for trust formation being unfavorable and
promoters lacking credit and capital.

MINE-OWNER STRONG
WINNER OF THE CASE
Jury in Denver Decides That He
Need Not Pay One Hundred
Thousand Dollars.
DENVER, May 17.â The suit against
Sam Strong, a wealthy Cripple Creek
mine owner, for $100,000 damages, which
has been on trial in the District Court
in this city for over three weeks, ended
this afternoon in a verdict for the defend
ant. The plaintiffs were E. J. Giddings,
William Lennox and others, who held a
bond and lease on the Strong mine when
the shafthcuse and machinery were de
stroyed by an explosion In 1894.
At that time the explosion was believed
to have been caused by striking miners,
and two men were subsequently convicted
and served sentences In prison for the
crime. At the trial of the damage suit
testimony was given to the effect that
Strong hired men to blow up the shaft
frxuse for the purpose of deterring the
p'aintiffs Â£ cm completing the purchase
of the mine, which, it was alleged, he
had discovered to be worth much more
than the price at which he had agreed to
sell. This testimony apparently was not
credited by the jury.
A suit was also filed by the Strong Min
ing Company against Strong on the same
grounds and for the same amount of dam
ages, but it will probably not be pressed,
as the witnesses would be the same as at
the trial which has just closed. . .
HOUSE OF POLICEMAN
DESTROYED BY DYNAMITE
Bomb Placed Under the Dwelling and
i "''Â¦'-* Â¦ ' Occupants Are Blown Out

AKRON, Ohio, May 17.â A two-story
frame dwelling at 220 Johnson street, in
East Akron, occupied by William J. Bru
ner, a policeman, was .wrecked by an ex
plosion of dynamite early to-day. Bruner,
his wife Elizabeth, his son George. 9 years
old, and Harold, a baby 18 months old,
were in the house at the time. They were
blown out of bed and buried under the de
bris, but were not. seriously Injured. The
wing of the house where Bruner, his wife
and baby slept was reduced to I kindling
wood.
The police believe that the dynamiting
was an attempt at revenge upon Police
man Bruner. South Akron has been in

ST. LOUIS, May 17.â President M. M.
Dolphin of 1 the Order of Railway Teleg
raphers, who has just returned to, the
headquarters of that organization from a
toisiness trip through the East, when
fhown a dispatch stating that the Order
of Railway Telegraphers is interested in
the establishment of an organization
similar to ; the old American Railway
fnlon on the Pacific coast, said:
â¢'The Order of Railway Telegraphers Is
neither officially nor otherwise connected
Â¦with such a movement. It it true that
two of our local officers in San Francisco
were connected with the movement and
they- were removed from office by me a
fr-w- days ago on that account. The plan
of organizing all railway employes into
one organization is not feasible and it is
my belief that it never will be. The old
class organizations which are now In ex
isicjice and have been for years have ac
complished great good for the railway em
ploves and there is no reason why they
cannot continue to do so. I will reiter
ate that we have not only not aided nor
slotted this new movement but that we
Ehall not recognize it In any way."

"WASHINGTON, May 17.â The celebrated
Itata case, Involving a claim of $320,000
against the Government of the United
States, is about to be determined by the
Chilean Claims Commission. The com
mission has cleared its entire docket of
cases, with the exception of this one,
which, by reason of Its importance, was
left until the last for special considera
tion. An adjournment has been taken to
permit the exchange of briefs and the
commission will reconvene on June 8 to
consider this case, the decision of which
will be rendered before the dissolution of
the body on June 14.
The sailing of the Itata from California
with a cargo of arms and ammunition for
Chile and her subsequent surrender to
the United States cruiser Charleston con
stituted one of the most stirring events
of the Chilean trouble In 1891. As set
forth in the official papers submitted to
the commission, ! the Itata was chartered
by the provisional government of- Chile
to â¢ transport small arms -for the .land
forces under that provisional government,
which is held to have been the lawful gov
ernment of Chile at that time. The Itata
proceeded to San DlegOj Cal., and soon
after took on a cargo consisting of 250
cases of rifles and 200 cases of ammuni
tion. The Bhlpment was made at a point
near the island of San Clemente on May
8, 1801. â¢ " â¢ Â¦ Â¦ * ' ; Â¦ ;Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦ â¢>.";'Â¦'
Just before this the steamer was-board
ed by one Spauldlng, said to be an officer
of the United States, who had | come to
take possession of the vessel. He .was set
ashore by the officers of the Itata On the
ground that he was unable tcTexhlbit any
authority as an officer of this Govern
ment. The Itata then took her cargo of
arms to Iaulaue.. After she started Amer
ican ships were 1 sent in chase or- her and
a famous race down through the Pacific
occurred. . . Â¦ ; Â¦Â¦Â¦:â¢â¢' Â¦Â¦/'Â¦' , ,
At the same time Admiral McCann.com
mander-ln-chlef of the American forces In
Chile, notified * the Chilean Government
that the Itata, in procuring her cargo of
arms, within the waters of the United
States, was guilty of a violation of our
neutrality laws. The document adds:' "
"Upon these representations of Admiral
McCann and because. of the demands. of
the Government of the United States, ac
companied as they "were by the presence
of a large naval force, the Itata -was sur
rendered under duress to the representa
tive of the United States. The Itata was
then brought back by the Charleston, un
der command of Captain Remey, and was
given over to the United States . Marshal
at San IMegro. JShe was libeled as being
In the possession of the Congressional
party of Chile, then attempting a-revolu
tion against the republic, and of carry
ing arms to this rebellious faction. The
case failed, however, "and the Itata re
turned to Chile."
! The claim now put in covers the time
of the vessel, $55,000; coal, $65,000; repairs
to vessel, $25,000; maritime risks, $10,000;
cablegrams, etc.. $7000; miscellaneous,
losses, $50,000. The Interest since 1S91
amounts to about $120,000 more, making
the total claim about $320,000.
'Aside from the claim itself, the case
presents many interesting legal questions
as to the right of a neutral government
to prevent the shipment of arms Intended
for belligerents. . - .

NEW YORK, May 17.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: .Aside from a. quite perceptible
Increase of the spirit of unrest in labor cir
cles there are few new changes to record in
the general trade or Industrial situation. -Busi
ness at present the country over Is of a season
able re-order character with wholesalers in dry
goods, clothing and similar lines, but the vol
ume of .business is fair for the season and
collections are rapid likewise. The basic facts
underlying the situation' continue largely: of a
favorable character. Notable in' this respect
is the. crop situation, particularly for the
cereals, which is in a high degree promising.
The hackward spring and lack of rains In some
sections has militated ' against the growth of
cotton, but Improvement is noted even In- this
respect. â¢ . .â¢ .
The industrials are active. Iron and . steel
are strong, but quiet . as regards new demand
for the. cruder forms, -but the nnJshed products
have been heavily ordered and the mills have
sufficient business to keep them busy from
one to three months, while a large additional
business is reported in sight. -The demand of
machinists is regarded as a possibly disturb
ing Â¦ feature, . but it- Is claimed, that : one-fourth
of the men involved have already succeeded
in their 'demands and the feeling is that this
matter will be : adjusted -with less than earlier
expected friction. . â¢ -Â¦
Â¦ The - hardware . trades . are reported ' exception
ally active and some varieties of goods, notably
barbed wire, are scarce. .
Foreign trade continues largely to favor this
country and the demand for wheat to replace
possible smaller yields in , European countries
has swelled the volume of export trade, which
might otherwise have fallen on* from" April a
year ago because of smaller shipments of/cot
ton and of manufactured goods. Despite the
talk of ' rate-cutting and of expectations â¢ of â¢ a
smaller movement of goods as the spring ad
vances railway earnings continue exceptionally
favorable, some > great systems ; reporting max
imum weekly, earnings. - - - Â¦ . .. â¢ â¢â¢ 'Â¦Â¦-.: -.
Net returns also : are - of good . volume - and
show that business le being. done at a. decided
profit. Probably the best reports .as to , new
demand come from *'Â¦ the ' leather and allied
trades, while : the poorest, t as heretofore, are
received from" the 'textile * industries." ; Prices
evidence considerable steadiness despite , slight-
Bradstreet's on Trade.
Local stocks and bonds -were dull on the
morning session of the Bond Exchange and
quotations showed no change worthy of note.

less. The San Francisco Oil Exchange will

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. May 17.â The fever and ner
vcusner.s were practically all gone out of the
stock market to-day. There were positive
demonstrations of strength, which was some
what intermittent and tpotty in the early deal
ings, hut which grew and broadened with the
progreFs of the day and closed with a buoyant
outburst which recalled the days of the early
rericd of the late boom. The strength in the
market was principally based on general con
ditions, but there were besides an unusually
large number cf stocks influenced by individ
ual causes. The aggregation of these strength
ening influences was a potent factor in Its sym
pathetic effect en thÂ» market. Broadly con
sidered the general f oeltng that prices . were
on a safer level by reason of the inflation let
out of them, while the business conditions of
the country and the earning power of prop
erties were unimpaired, encouraged the buying.
The evidence that forced liquidation growing
out et the . panic had been .completed was
thought t<> leave the way open for renewed
advance. The indicatl >ns for to-morrow'6 bank
statement were of such strong recuperative
power that some pressure to lend money eeemed
a probability not far In the future. It should
not escape notice, however, that the principal
buying of the day came through the same
channel? as that which marked the -leadership
of the recent bull speculation into its last
Ftagf s of excess. These operations were sup
posed in Wall street to be inspired in the in
terest of the great combinations of capital
v.hos=e measures of consolidation have produced
a crop of new securities which remain to be
EucoessfuIIy marketed to insure the reimburse
ment of the expenses of these consolidations.
The belief in the settlement of the Union Pa
cific controversy is felt to offer assurance of
a more effective solution of the whole railroad
controversy than has ever before been known.
The promises of the stocks of railroads in that
rtpion were due to this cause. There were very
definite reports afloat that the dividend on Mis
souri Pacific at the rate of 5 per cent was an
â¢rarly probability. The movement in the local
tractions was due to the inauguration of the
underground trolley on additional lines of the
Metropolitan Street Railway and estimates of
the benefits to result to the Manhattan systems
from the use of electricity. Sugar was affected
by reports of an agreement with the coffee in

NEW YORK, May 17.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: ,
All through this week the stock market has
been experiencing various stages which usually
follow a condition of panic, which existed ten
days ago. The volume of transactions has
fallen off sharply and only, became compara
tively active when heavy liquidation w.as in
progress, as was the case on Tuesday.' The
public has become sold out and has little ap
petite for speculation and Wall street has been
adjusting losses and the- other complications
which resulted from the severe and swift de
cline. There is. buying of good stocks by in
vestors on what have seemed to be favorable
terms, but these are outright purchases, and
even the news which met the street on Wednes
dayâthat a substantial settlement of differ
ences had been made â¢ between . the parties to
the Northern Pacific contestâ failed to stimu
late public speculation;
Professional manipulation, it . is true, "was
active In support of the prices after this be
came known, but the outside buying was small
and on Thursday the total transaction at the
Stock Exchange fell to below. 1,000,000 shares,
the first time that has occurred for a full day's
business in quite a while. . The street Is again
bullish in sentiment.
t CHICAGO, May 17.â Considering the copious
rainfall in the Southwest and the general
tenor of the crop news, wheat opened sur
prisingly firm. July Vi@Vic to %@%c higher at
71%@71%c. Tlie market seemed to have broken
away from its contemplation of the weather
map and was in position to attach more im
Â¦ portance to an advance at Liverpool. -.Trade
was on a moderate scale, the demand coming
mostly from shorts, and during the remainder
of. the day prices were well above' yesterday's
level. 1 Following the opening the firmness was
augumented by moderate primary receipts,
heavy seaboard clearances, big local shipments
and the expectation that the visible figures
Monday would show an imposing decrease.
July gradually; worked up to -72%c and al
though selling was freer at this price. It closed
firm, ,%c higher at 71%@71%c. May wheat. was
In demand for the Eastern account and also
scored an advance. The bull interest in corn
was moderately active in the wheat pit, ap
parently buying for investment. Continental
crops were reported Improved. . t
In the corn pit Phillips and his party were
the ruling factor. I A continuation by Phillips
of liquidation of May gave rise to reports
that he, was nearly. If not entirely free, of.
the enormous load of ' corn which he had
bought to put himself in control of that de
livery. His sales to-day approximated 1,000,000
bushels, and the price dropped from 54%c to
50c, and at the close was 4c under yesterday at
50%c. Meanwhile he was buying July corn
on a heavy scale. July closed a shade lower
at 44%c- '
Oats were dull and easier in sympathy with
corn.' July closed %c lower at 28%c.
Provisions were quiet, but in the main pre
served a firm tone In sympathy with light re
ceipts of hogs. July pork, lard and ribs each
closed 2%c higher. Â¦

principal factor." Shipments from there were,
light, _being 776,000 bushels, against 2,298,000 for
the same week last year. .-.The Argentine re
ports were very satisfactory, especially In re
gard to corn, the quality being the highest for
several years. Â¦ The estimates for this cereal
are being Increased, the xportable surplus now
being placed at 1,700,000 tons.

/ Fruits and Salmon in London.
-he London Grocers' Gazette of April 4
keys: "The salmon market is in a somewhat
unsatisfactory position, as while the consump
tive demand is improving, prices are some
what irregular, owing to weak holders being
anxious to realize as least a portion of their
supplies at prices favoring buyers. Finest
qualities are in comparatively small compass
' and are difficult to buy. The Sprfngbum has
orriied here with 52.3S3 cases frcm San Fran
cisco and the Glenhurst has brought to Liver
pool i'^So cases from British Columbia. . The
uncertainty regarding the new duties is in
terfering with business in California fruits,
{ holders generally being unwilling to make
contracts at present prices, but any supplies
offering at about late rates readily find buy
ers. The rate of duty on apricots Is as yet
uncertain' and it is stated that an attempt
will be made to impose a duty of 7s per cwt.,
j as on evaporated apricots. This would be
equivalent to 3s 6d per case, or roughly. 2d
lÂ»er tin, and it is being strenuously resisted,
as it would bring the article out of reach "of
the working-class buyers. The Springburn
has iitTived with Â£2,688 cases."

Failures for the week numbered 177 in tbo
United States, against 177 last year, and 39
in Canada, against 30 last year.
Contracts in May corn have been closed at
phenomenal prices; owing to clever manipula
tion at Chicago, : next crop's options are sus
tained beyond the prices warranted by encour
aging crop Â¦ reports. More foreign Inquiry for
corn increased Atlantic exports for the' week
to 2,458,681 bushels, against only 1,211,244 In the
previous week, but the movement is still far
below the figures of a year ago.
Wheat goes out in greater volume than a
year ago. but our shipments are comparatively
light.
Both wheat and corn continue to sell at more
than 10 cents a bushel above the price at this
date last year, and the fluctuations in specula
tive options are much wider.
Crop reports continue in the main favorable,
and an easy money market tends to encourage
business â¢ enterprises which looked aghast at
the collapse of stock speculation. The calmer
tone In securities Is welcomed in all directions.
As against the favorable departments referred
to there is but one adverse factor, and the
labor disturbances in several quarters are not
considered likely to be a long drawback and
promise not to very generally affect the trades
involved. Less urgency for early delivery of
iron and steel products was reported at manu
facturing centers. With mills assured of ac
tivity beyond the middle of the year and some
uncertainty regarding the labor organizations'
attitude on the wage schedule, there Is a dis
position to let new engagements wait as long
as possible. Unusual activity is seen In agri-*
cultural ; supplies and some noteworthy ship
ments were reported during the week, while
makers of this class of machinery, purchased
freely of bar iron. Structural shapes are in
such active domestic demand that little at
tention is given to available foreign contracts.
Coke production Is still enormous, as vie nat
ural, with Iron furnaces operating at the great
est weekly capacity ever recorded.
Forwardings of boots and shoes, from Bos
ton for the last two weeks reach the excep
tional total of 207,307 cases, or 48 per cent more
than In the corresponding weeks of 1900, and
since January 1 shipments exceed last year by
12,147 cases, while the increase over all pre
vious years was much more.
NEW YORK. May 17.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade . to-morrow will say:
are diminishing, as spring Is approaching It
is singular that the coal demand sustains itself
so well, when 1 It is known that the deliveries
here of fuel oil are so liberal, supplanting fully
25 per cent of coal consumption. It is very
evident that the fuel being utilized this yearâ
in the shape of coal and oil â is considerably
larger than any preceding year up to date. Oil
is a disturbing element In establishing fuel
values, as at the present asking prices there
certainly can be no profit to the producers.
The principal aim of each company Is not what
is the best - available price, but who can sell
the lowest. The quantity pumped does not
Justify this sacrifice, but I presujne it will
continue until there-is some unanimity of ac
tion." â¢"

-Mr. Sanborn says that a forced sale of
the property would seriously. Injure his
and his children's Interests. He desires to
be able to protect himself as far as possi
ble-by bidding, at the sale, and for that
reason filed his petition.
Judge Melvin accepted the resignation'
thus leaving, Judge Ogden to . manage * the
estate alone- and leaving Mr.: Sanborn ; to
act simply in his capacity as one, of the
heirs to protect himself from loss by ; a
sale at an unfavorable time. â¢ /
Sanborn's wife was a. daughter of Mrs.
Hutchinson, who died in 1898, leaving
property to the amount of over $100,000.. In
her will, which gave a legacy of $10,000 to
Sanborn and $3000 each to his two chil
dren, she named her son-in-law as execu
tor, together with Judge F. B. Ogden. -
In his petition to the court to be allowed
to resign Mr. Sanborn states that the
Eastern heirs wished to realize at once on
their bequests, and . became increasingly
discontented with the action of the ex
ecutors In holding the property for more
favorable market conditions. The Eastern
heirs finally went so far as to send- a rep
resentative to the coast with power of at
torney "to investigate the conduct; of the
executors. Tho attorney, says Mr. San
born, went oypr the matter in detail and
expressed himself as satisfied that the es
tate was being properly handled. In spite
of this the attorney filed, -as 'soon as he
reached New York, a petition in the Pro

of the property and a distribution to the
heirs/. Â¦â¢Â¦.'â¢ . Â¦ . ' .. Â¦. â¢

Woman Seeks Companion s
Arrest and Learns She
Is Not a Wife.
ALAMEDA, May 17.â Mrs. Mary Perry
came in from Bay Farm Island this morn
ing to geta warrant for her husband's
arrest, and ' she wound up \ by getting ? a
.marriage license for . him. ; ; For, . fifteen
years Mrs. Perry has labored J under ; the
delusion that she was Mrs'.* Antone Perry,
bona fide, and it was only her anxiety
to have her better half put into jail; that
disclosed to her the fact that she was
mistaken. The discovery was as great a
surprise to the man In the case as It was
to the woman, but he H was not so-non
plused but Â¦ that he could t take . advantage
of the dilemma, and /he lost no : time . in
using it as a bludgeon to get himself out
of trouble. â¢
Fifteen years ago Antone Perry thought
he married Miss Mary I Montell and Â¦ Mis3
Mary Montell thought she - married An
tone Perry. A priest performed the mar
riage ceremony. Perry Â¦ was : in extremis
at that time and the marriage was done
up in a hurry; but' for some reason,
known only to himself, the husband did
not ale. In fact he has lived to be blessed
with seven children, whose ages range
from 6 to 14 years. -. r .
Lately, . however, the Perrys have not
lived happily together. They - have . had
frequent quarrels, and sometimes the fur
niture took wings. The climax of a series
of squabbles came this morning when
Mrs. Perry packed her things and 'came
to town, determined to have her husband
arrested on a charge of battery. She told
Justice Morris that Â¦, her husband had
abused her. The Justice asked the woman
a few questions and in the course of the
dialogue it developed that Mrs. Perry
had been ' married without the â¢ formality
of securing a license, making the wedding
invalid.
S Justice Morris told the woman that the
only way out of her dilemma was to get
married again. The husband came in at
this juncture and was told all about It.
Perry told his wife that the only condi
tions under which he would marry her
again were that she agree not to nave
him arrested and to be docile: in the fu
ture. Mrs. Perry saw the force of the
argument and acquiesced. Then- the cou
ple went to Oakland for a license, came
back and this afternoon were married by
Justice Morris.

proposed payment of the company's bills
for this fiscal year. The corporation's at
torneys object to the final clause- of the
stipulation, which covers the question of
rights of forfeiture of the company's
plant. It reads as follows:
And out cf greater caution It is hereby
rpeclflca.l!y provided that the said claim of
esid city a* to the forleiture of said property
and any claim or claims of said city for for
feiture of said property of said company shall
in no wise be affected by this agreement or
by any act or thing done or had in pursuance
thereof.
The remainder of the stipulation is sat
isfactory to the corporation. ; It follows in
part: Â¦
Whereas. There is a tfeficiency in the High
School fund of said city and it is desired to
use for ;Hien School 'wrposes a portion of the
funds which might be made available for pay
ment of said claim of *^.id water company, and
Whereas, The company Is willing to release
nnd forego a portion of its said claim for said
water provided a portion of said money bo in
tald fund shall' be devoted to the payment of
its said claim and that the remainder of said
money snail be devoted to said High School
purposes.
The stipulation provides for the pay
ment by the city of the rebated water
bills, the company to waive all rights un
der the litigation now in progress, to any
additional payment on this year's ac
count. 'Â¦"Â¦ : A
The failure of the water company to ac
cept the stipulation leaves the matter of
payment of high school teachers' salaries,
temporarily at least, in the air.. City At
torney Johnson declares he will not strike
out the forfeiture clause on his own mo
tion. He said:
"I was directed by resolution of the
City Council to draft a stipulation which
would safeguard all the rights of*the city
if a compromise were agreed to and en
tered into. This direction, I. believe, I
have accomplished. ' The stipulation, as
drawn, is intended In no wise to affect
pending litigation, cither in the interest of
thÂ« city or of the water company. Hence
I shall'not. under my Instructions, accede
to the water company's renuest to elim
inate the forfeiture clause." f - Â¦
President Dingee of the water company
said: . '
"The. objectionable clause, according to
Attorney McCutchen. embodies a virtual
admission that the city has a legal claim
to forfeiture, but his main objection to it
is that it relates to matters and actions :
not Included in the pending suit between
the city and the water company." .
The matter must be referred to the City
Council for settlement.
Declines to Accept the
Terms Offered by
the City.

OAKLAND, May 17.â Threatened
with loss of sight and sorely In
need of money, Ernest Tracey
wrote a note to the young lady
to whom he was engaged and
then took a dose of carbolic acid to-day.
He Tras found before the acid had time
to complete Its work, and is now at the
Oakland Receiving Hospital on the verge
of death!
Tracey has faced the hardest kind of
luck since he came to Oakland and he
finally decided that carbolic acid was
about as easy a. 'way as any out of his
troubles. He came to Oakland about six
months ago from Shasta County. His
father is reputed to be a wealthy man
in that section, and Tracey himself was
engaged In the lumber business with J. L.
Bass. He went to board with B. P. Smith
at 419 Tenth street. Tracey did not discuss
his private affairs very much, but he said
enough at different times to convey the
idea that he had had some differences
with his father, and that he hoped that
hJs father would relent and relieve the
financial condition Into which he had fall
en. He did not seem very successful in

LITTLE ROCK. Ark., May 17.-At the
opening of the second day's session'of the
Southern Presbyterian Assembly, Dr. J.
C. Mullory of Owensboro, Ky., offered a
touching prayer for Mrs. McKinley'* re
covery. The presbytery of Brownwood,
Tex., asked for a modification of the pas
toral letter in reference to dancing, urg
ing that the words "dancing, which is
Innocent." be expunged from paragraph
two of the preamble. There were numer
ous overtures protesting against the in
sertion of a footnote to the confession of
faith on the "elect Infant clause" and
they were referred to a special commit
tee composed of one representative from
each synod.. â¢ , â . .

Dr. Purves said he believed this end
could be more quickly reached by the co
operation of the different branches of the
Christian church, which for various rea
sons are now separated. Mr. Spver'8
topic' was "The Speedy Bringing of the
World to Chrlit." He urged earnest ef
fort In evangelization.
Any assault upon. the fundamental conception
of man's relation to God Is the most dangerous
of all the problems with which the Christian
church must deal. The problem lies in the re
lation of religion to the Intellectuality of man.
We want religion that will command' the. ra
tional assent of the human mind. The solution
of this problem is the definition and defense of
the supernatural in history. It is our Intention
to face the doubt of the twentieth century with
an affirmation of thÂ» transcendant, supernat
ural, self-revealing God. This relation of the
organized church to social progress is another
problem. How shall the organized Christian
church meet the social requirements of the day?
We must appeal to men's hearts and con
sciences and we must save the individual
morally.
The address of Dr. Purves on "The
Problems of the Twentieth Century" was
a presentation of the. conditions now. con-
Irontlng the Christian church. Among
other things Dr. Purves said:
The New Century's Task.
"Well," responded tho President, "I
hope you won't revise out of It the doc
trine of predestination." .
"Let us hope," said Dr. McCook, "that
as our beloved President sits by the bed
side of the noble woman whom he
wedded in a Buckeye Presbyterian
church this goodly doctrine may be a
comfort to him, whatever the issue, and
that he may say with resignation, 'Not
my will, but thine, be done.' "
The speakers at the afternoon session
were the newly elected moderator, the
Rev. Dr. H. C. Minton: the Rev. Dr.
George C. Purves of New York and Rob
ert E. Speer of New York City. Dr. Min
ton spoke â¢ on "The Divine Purpose De
veloped -in the Progress of the Time,"
and said, in part:
The page of the past Is but a transcript of the
progressively unfolding Idea, and even to us It
must be clear that the history of man can be
known at all only in so far as in the same
sense It is the outworking of an intelligent
idea. The reformed churches have compared
revealed truths with the wiser thought of the
human mind, and they have found them testi
fying In harmony that the only key which win
fit the problems of world-history is the single
truth tfcat God rules.
"So you are going to revise your con
fession of faith V" To which the commlt
teeman replied, Â¦ "We are going to con
sider the Question."
The Rev. Dr. McCook'a. address was
principally a history of the Presbyterian
church. In speaking of the doctrine of
predestination he referred touchingly to
Mrs. McKlnley. He stated that President
McKinley, on meeting a member of the
revision committee, remarked to the lat
ter: . . <
President on Predestination.
During the course of his remarks Dr.
Craig said the worldwide problem ot uni
versal evangelization could only be solved
when nations were brought Into contact
with each other. *
"Wo must annihilate distance." he said.
"We must subjugate nature and come
fece to face with the people whom, we ex
pect to convert." .
To-day waa devoted exclusively to a
proper observance of the occasion, and
prominent ministers and laymen from all
section* of the country participated In the
exercises Incident to, the celebration. The
twentieth century meeting , was . in pur*
suance of a resolution adopted by the
General Assembly In St. Louis last year.
Tho programme was laid down In tha res
olution of the assembly.
John H. Converse, LL.D., of thta city
presided. The celebration began with the
singing of the long meter doxology, fol
lowed by an invocation by Dr. Minion, tho
now moderator. Addressed were made by
tho Rev. Willis O. Craig, D.D., LU !>.. of
Chicago, who presented a review of the
nineteenth century, and tho Rev. Henry
C. McCook, D.D., S.C.D., of this city, on
"Profrresn of tho Presbyterian Church In
thÂ« Nlneteeth Century.' 1

-The suit : of Johanne Wobber again3t
Sigel Grove No. 7, U. A. O.D., for the re
coveryof a -widow's allowance of 5100 was
on trial yesterday before Justice of the
Peace- Daniels. Mrs. Wobber's husband
was a member. of. the" grove at the time he
died,' but was eight months m arrears.
The officers of the grove testified that the
widow is not entitled to the allowance be
cause the by-laws provide that no mem
ber in arrears for three months shall re
ceive any benefits.'
Mrs. Wobber, however. In rebuttal,
claimed that the grove had paid her the
funeral benefit of 560, to which every Dru
id Is entitled to, unless expelled. It had,
however, retained $11 to pay her husband's
arrears for eight months, giving lier a re
ceipt in full therefor. She contended that
the grove had waived the provision of the
by-laws, on the subject by accepting the
payment for her husband's dues.- Mrs.
Wobber's attorney held that this amount
ed- to a reinstatement of but ex-
Judge Bahrs,- who appeared for the grove,
argued that it was impossible to reinstate
a dead" man. and as- Wobber was over
three months in arrears his widow was not
entitled' to the allowance. ' The case went
over until next Monday, when xhe" books

In deciding the cases the court says that
the Question whether or not the location
of a mining claim by an alien may be at
tacked in a suit between private parties
has always been answered in the negative
by the decisions of the courts of the
United States. As between the parties to
the present suit it is clear in the light of
authority that tho question of citizenship
is not in issue and that the alienage of
the original. locator is not involved. This
is a matter, says the court, which con
cerns the Government of the United
States and with which the parties to this
liti w ation have nothing to do. The caae
prceents only the question of the right of
possession as between two contesting lo
cators. It in no way involves the ultinjate
right of either to a patent to the mining
claim. The whole of the merits of the
controversy may be determined upon con
sideration of this single question, and it
would be fruitless as well as vexatious to
remand the case for further litigation.
The order appointing a receiver Is.re
versed ; and the case : remanded, with Â¦ in
structions- to dismiss the bill. -
The cases dismissed yesterday are those
of John I. Tornanses vs. L. F. Melsing et
aL, Mickle J. Nackkela et al. vs. Herbert
H. Webster and that of William A. KJell
man vs. Henry Rogers/ The reasons
given in the case of Tornanses vs. Mels-
Ing^ are applicable to the two others. It
was alleged byÂ«Melsing that Tornanses
was an alien, a subject of the Russian
empire and a Mongolian -by race, and as
such was not entitled to receive a patent
from the United. States for the property
in controversy, placer mining claim No.
10. above Discovery, on Anvil Creek. Tor
nantes conveyed his 'Â¦_ claim I to the Wild
Goose Mining Company. Melslng also
riled a location on the theory' that Tor

the premises and was ejected by Tor
nantes.

Judge/ Troutt Takes Father's Appli
: cntion for Modification of De
cree Under Advisement.
: Little Kathlynne Coleman is still In the
.WEtody of her mother. Mrs. Mabel Cole
man-Smith. John M. Coleman, father of
the ' child, appeared before Judge Troutt
yef terday to press his petition for a mod
ification of the decree of divorce procured
by l?im, by. the terms of which. his former
wife was given the custody of the child,
tise same to pass to him, however. In
event she again married.
When Mrs. Coleman-Smlth married her
pj-escnt husband, Edwin V. Smith, Cole
man immediately took steps to secure the
custody of his child. But Judge Troutt
held that as Mrs. Coleman-Smith had re
rrjarried within one year from the date of
t^ie decree of divorce the Fame was in
vfalid. In law. Judge Troutt held, the
former Mrs. Coleman waÂ« still a grass
widow and the custody of the child in
Â«-onseyuence did not as yet pass to the
fsther under the terms of the decree.
The court Intimated, however, that he
would entertain a motion to modify the
decree, which was made yesterday on the
pround that Mrs. Coleman-Smlth was not
married to Edwin V. Smith and hence was
an unlit and Improper person to have the
custody and control of the child. Cole
rsan also took the Etand and testified that
his former wife did not properly care for
the child and that frequently before he
divorced her she would leave the child for
clays at a time and come to this city un
<i^,r the pretense that she was 111, which.
Ooleman said, was not the fact.
Galen Burdell and Edwin V. Smith tes
tified on behalf of Mrs. Coleman-fimlth.
both agreeing that she was a gentle and
affectionate mother. Judge Troutt thfen
took the case under advisement. Later in
tjifc day Mrs. Coleman-Smlth filed a. peti
tfon for letters of guardianship upon the
Pf rton and estate of her daughter. In her
petition she stated that the little miss had
an interest in the estate of her prand
irfotfcer. Mrs. Mary A. Burdell. and that
it was necessary that a guardian be ap
pointed to care for the same.
Coleman will oppose this petition, and it
is not probable that a settlement of the
controversy between him and his former
wife will be finally made until after the
Supreme Court has passed upon the valid
ity of marriages of divorced people sol
qnnized without the limits of this State
within one year from the date of a decree
of divorce. ' w

LABOR COUNCIL AFTER LONG SESSION
ADOPTS TWO IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS
Judge, Seawell -points out; that, though
there is nothing to show that Mr.Â«Paxton.
has not always treated his daughter with
kindness and that he may have the right
to deduct- the amount of, the -judgment
from - future payments to Mrs Paxton
still Dr. . Selfridge should be given judg
ment against, him under â¢ the > law which
compels parents. to support. their offspring
and permits none of their own offenses to
absolve them from this duty.' -
Blitz W. Paxton, capitalist, has been
held liable by Judge Seawell for the carÂ©
of his daughter, Roma W. Paxton, who is
now in the custody of her mother, Bessie
E. Paxton, whose recent debut on the
vaudeville stage interested "society of this
city and the southern portion of the State.
Judge Seawell handed down a decision
yesterday giving Judgment for $918 in fa
vor of Dr. Grant Self ridge and against
Mr. Paxton and his former wife, who was
joined in the suit as a defendant.
Dr. Selfridee treated Miss Paxton for
several months ia 1900, but Mr. Paxton re
fused to pay tiie bill when presented on
the ground that by the terms of the de
cree- of divorce. Issued In 1894, his former
wife was given the custody of. the child"
and hence, as he was paying Mrs. Paxtlon
$100 a month, she should pay all expenses
incurred on behalf of r Miss Paxton.
Judge Seawell,. however,' holds that a
parent. is always- responsible for the care
and | maintenance of , a ; child. ' And says
the court,' the commission ! of an - offense
by a parenr which results in the passing
of the custody of his child to another does
not 'absolve him from further liability or'
responsibility as far as ' the child is con
cerned, v If it. did it would open a danger
ous . by - following .which , parents
might free themselves from such respon
sibility, which the law intends they -shall

BURT REFUSES TO TALK ABOUT
UNION PACIFIC'S PROPOSED LINE
16
HORACE G-. BTJRTv president of
the Union Pacific Railroad, passed
through San Francisco yesterday
on his way back to Omaha. Few
people around the Palace Hotel
recognized the railroad magnate, and he
did not go out of his way to make his
identity known, being of an unassuming
nature.
President Burt left Uvada about two
weeks ago, accompanied by two survey
ors. They went directly over the proposed
extension of the Union Pacific, which it is
proposed to extend to Los Angeles. They
traveled x over the entire distance in a
wagon and took notes for future refer
ence.
Burt has the reputation of keeping his
own counsel and yesterday when he was
Interviewed he lived up to his record. He>
said that he had been over the survey of
the new road: that he had had a most en
joyable trip and that he was on his way
back to Omaha.
"When do you expect to start work on
your new road?" he was asked.
"I cannot tell you." he replied. "That is
a matter I cannot talk about."
"Did you see any signs of activity on the
line of the proposed Clark road in your
Journey?" '
"Yes. I* saw some surveyors at work."
answered Burt. "I do not know, however,
what Clark Is doing. I suppose he intends
building his road, but that is a matter
that I have nothing to do with."
President Burt was a. busy man yester
day. He paid a short visit to the Union
Pacific and Chicago and Northwestern
railroad offices and inquired how business
was. He is of a very energetic tempera
ment and decided.- late in the afternoon
that he would better return to his head-
Quarters in Omaha.
The Union Pacific has a road extending
from Salt Lake to Uvada, and a line of
survey for a new road running: Into Cali
fornia. This survey was made several
years ago. About a year- ago Senator
Clark threatened to build a road from Salt
Lake to Southern California, He com
menced his work by sending surveyors
out- from Los Aneeles. The moment he
took this step the Union Pacific Railroad
took a lively interest in the completion of
the extension and terminus in Southern.
California. Burt's trip in a wagon over
the line of the road is the latest phase of
the situation. After his return to Omaha
it will become known whether another
railroad is to have a terminus .n Cali
fornia.- . . â¢';
