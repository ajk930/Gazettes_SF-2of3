Told to Make an Appeal.
Secretary Gage told the Illinois cemmit
teemen they ought to have the question
taken before the Beard of General Ap
praisers. He said a cargo of sugar was
about to arrive in Baltimore on which thÂ«
countervailing duty would amount to W000
or $3000. If the Importer of this sugar felt
that the countervailing duty was unjust
or illegal and not based properly upon the
assumption that a bounty was paid by the
Russian Government, then the -Importer
ought to take the case before the General
Appraisers.
Secretary Gage Is having prepared a
statement by the Bureau of Statistics on
the loss on all articles affected by the
Russian order in trade between Russia
and the United States. He expects this
to show that less than $4,000,000 of our
trade with Russia Is affected.

obligations he had taken.
CALL BUREAU. 1403 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, March 6.â Secretary
Gage, backed by the administration, has
decided no longer to remain on the de
fensive in the controversy regarding his
action in Imposing a countervailing duty
on Russian sugar on the assumption that
the Russian Government paid a bounty
on all sugar exported. President McKin
ley told a delegation that called on him
to-day to ask for a reversal of Secretary
Gage's decision that he was sorry there
should be any tariff differences between
the United States and Russia, and he
could only suggest that those interested
take an appeal to the General Appraisers.
The turning point In Secretary Gage's
policy of treating the question came yes
terday, when a committee of the Illinois
Manufacturers* Association, representing
business associates and personal and po
litical friends of the Secretary, called at
the Treasury Department to protest
against further imposition of the counter
vailing duty. The committee was headetl
by Martin B. Madden and Included Wil
liam C. Mundt, Charles ffi Deere. J. il.
Glenn and William D. Haney.
Strong Protest Entered.
Madden declared to Secretary Gage that
the members of the association employed
not less than 300.000 men in works having
an output valued at not less than $2,000.
000.000 annually, and were largely engaged
In sending manufactured goods to other
countries. They felt that they were to be
Injured If retaliatory measures were to be
enforced through the Imposition of a
countervailing duty. They found fault
with Gage for deciding the question as he
had, demanded to know -whether McKin
ley's policy of protection was to be re
versed, asserted that it would affect all
the agricultural and manufacturing inter
ests of the United States and asked that
the decision be reversed.
Secretary Gage is usually a very mild
spoken man. but In his reply to the com
mittee he talked with great vigor and Jus
tified his action. He alluded to the fact
that the committee made claims to repre
sent 300.000 worklngmen of Illinois. He
said he knew the representatives of three
and one-half millions of citizens of Illi
nois, and these were Senators and Repre
sentatives in Congress. If there was to
be any relief It must be sought In Con
gress. He had acted entirely under the
law, and if he had decided otherwise than

was universally understood that the
whole night would be devoted to this Eng
lish question and then the debate on the
remaining items would stand adjourned.
On this understanding a large number of
Irish members, including some of the
most experienced members of the party,
left the House. Suddenly at the close of
the sitting, at midnight, Balfour proposed
to closure the discussion on the entire
vote of Â£17,000.000. This naturally pro
voked an outburst on the part of the Irish
members who were In the House. The
scene was one most disgraceful to the
English Parliament. We intend to raise
the matter as a question of privilege. As
a matter of fact, some of the members
were turned out of the House who took
no part In the scene and most brutal vio-
Jence was exhibited in the removing of
some of our members. The action of the
Government is likely to defeat its object
and will make the Irish members more
determined than ever to resist the Gov
ernment's plan to choke the discussion of
Irish affairs."
"The scene last night' In the _House of
Commons was the direct result of a trick
on the part of the Government. A vote
on' account- for ; Â£17,000,000 had been
brought lip for discussion. It covered a
multitude of < -items - and included over
Â£2,000,000 for Irish "purposes. - The discus

John Redmond said to a correspondent:
Redmond Says It Is a Trick.
It is understood that Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman will protest against
wholesale closuring. His view is that the
difficulties Parliament has to -face would
have beeni to a greatÂ«Â«xtent, prevented
if it had met a fortnight earlier.
Balfour's proposal to make suspension
for the remainder of the session. the pen
alty of "disobedience â¢to the chair Is ex
pected to lead to an angry debate.- The'
action of the Irish members is universally
condemned, but at the same time Bal
four's attempt to drive rather than lead
tho House meets with much disapproba
tion. It Is argued that the Government
knew they had a very heavy financial
session 'ahead, .and yesterday. Instead of
calling Parliament early, called it later
than usual. ; 'V 'Â¦.â¢Â¦"â¢

It Is understood that Balfour .proposes
to alter the House of Commons rule relat
ing 'to suspensions,, making -the punish
ment so severe as to make a repetition of
last night's j revolt against the authority
of the chair unlikely.
? Balfour subsequently, gave notice of a
motion to be made to-morrow to. suspend
such offenders hereafter for the remainder
of the session'. / .
Balfour, remarking that he presumed it
was desired to ; Institute means for pre
venting a recurrence of the scenes of last
night, promised to cons'der what opportu

Redmond tried to move an adjournment
and appealed to Balfour, the Government
leader, to give the members an opportuni

LONDON, March 6.â The excitement
occasioned by last night's scenes
in the House of Commons is still
very evident, and when the House
met at noon to-day. In view of
possible disturbances ihe whole police
force on duty at St. Stephens had been
mobilized and reinforced - by reserves.
John Redmond, the Nationalist leader,
speedily rose and raised a question d
privilege arising from "the painful scene*
of last night." He claimed that members
had been suspended without proper steps
being taken to identify them and that
their removal had been accompanied by
undue violence. He was satisfied, he said,
that members were suspended who had
actually gone to . the lobby to participate
in the division.
The Speaker, in reporting, pointed out
that Redmond was not raising a question
of privilege but a point of order. If he
was properly informed of any wrongful
suspensions he (the Speaker) would be glad
to take steps to rectify them.

Curiously enough the War Office seems
genuinely -without definite information re

great financial firms whose interests in

the Government believe' from their pri
vate advices that the present situation

General Botha and the forces under his
immediate command, while the other
Boer units will" remain In the field.
Other Boers Remain in. Field.
It is also understood that DrV Leyd3
was recently negotiating to secure peace
terms, but wlien it was discovered that
he was merely acting a farce, not being
in communication with General Botha or
not able to live up to the tentative sug
gestions made, the British Government
having learned his .views, quickly ended
the negotiations, especially when it wa3
found that Lord Kitchener was treatinsr
with General Botha, while Dr. Leyds was
unable to speak authoritatively for the
forces In the field.
"General Dewet and General Delarey. us

as to what forces he can bring with him.

It is stated here that Sir, Alfred Mllner
has gone to Pretoria with the object of
assisting Lord Kitchener, In t these nego

be due to General Botha's desire to con
sult with Acting 1 President Schalkberger
at Pletersburg and to make terms apply
ing to the whole Boer forces; but militat

as to General Botha's anility to control

Botha Is encountering. One of the best

tration officials are very much worried
over the Chinese situation. Their appre-.
tensions are due not merely to the" signs
of the purpose of certain powers to delay
the completion of neg-otiations but to the
constantly increasing danger that some of
them will find a way to obtain a hold
upon Chinese territory that cannot be
loosened.
Although all the governments well un

subject.
Special Commissioner Itockhlll has sub

to the total Indemnity to be demanded of
the Chinese and its distribution by the
Ministers. In case of failure to agree, the
distribution would be made by The Hague
Court of Arbitration.
Other diplomats in Peking approve tho.
principle of the American proposal, bu:
pay they have no instructions to act on
It, and some of the powers do not seem to
think there is any nee-i for hurry.
Rockhlll has suggested $170,000,000 as tho
amount of indemnity to be demanded, but

TRIPLE TRAGEDY IN PEKING.
German Murders His Wife, Wounds
Her Lover and Kills Himself.
VANCOUVER. B. C March 6.âJapan
ese papers which arrived to-day by tho
steamship Empress of India contain news
of a terrible tragedy which occurred in
Peking early in February. Lieutenant
Denninar, an officer of one of the British
regiments at Peking. was mortally
wounded, but was still alive when the
last telegrams were received. .
Denning Is alleged to haucr been inti
mate with the wife of August Llndberg.
a German ex-ofilcer, who was attached
to the legation at the Chinese capital.
Lindberg heard of the scandal and hur
ried to Dcnnlng's residence. He found
that Denning had left for another port of
the city. Llndberg was further encaged
by the fact that his wife had accompa
nied the Englishman and he followed
them. He found the couple together and
opened fire.
According to the dispatches Denning
tried to protect the woman by placing
himself between her. and the angry hus
band, but .Llndberg shot her dead with
the first bullet and Denning fell with a
bullet in his body. Lindberg then turned
the weapon on himself. He fired two
jfhots over his heart and died almost ln-
Btantly. "

GRAVE DANGER
OF PARTITION
SHARP WORDS
FOR BRITAIN
Senator Morgan Scores thÂ§
Policy of King Edward's
Government.
"We will make no compromise with
Great Britain upon that subject. -We will
make no concession to Great Britain in
relation to the treaty. What we shall do
with itâ and some of our people are op
posed to even thatâ Is that we shall de
clare It abrogated. If the vote on my res
olution could be taken to-day it would In
form the President of the - United States
that he has no two-thirds majority In the
Senate to adopt any' compromise he may
make with Great Britain.
"If It is the purpose of Great Britain
still to look for delay, she will not get it.
If it be her determination to pick a quar
rel with ua about it. she will find the
United States can muster at least half
the ' number of men who voted for the
President in the last electionâ fighting
men. And she will find, when that war
terminates, that the steel band which
binds the throne in London with Austra
lia and India and passes through Canada
will have been rent In twain, and with Its
severance down will go the empire."
The Objections to Compromise.
He regarded the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
in the nature of twi alliance, "a shameful
alliance," with Great Britain, and de
nounced any suggestion of. the inability of
the United States to sever such an al
liance without incurring the penalties of a
war. He maintained that in spite of the
silence of Great Britain the United States
could abrogate the treaty at any time,
anfl until it was abrogated it would act as
a clog upon the extension of the com
merce of this country.
"There cannot be anything more pre
cious to-day to Great Britain," said he.
"than to prevent the construction of the
Nicaragua canal. If Great Britain by her
'golden silence' can prevent that her
profits will continue, and the longer she
can do that tho greater will be her profits
on the Suez canal. She has .remained as
silent as the Sphynx which looks out upon
the Nile and upon the desert, and she
Beems to be looking out upon a de#eri_of

to say, American honor. Great Britain Is
still silent. ;:.' :,;
Silence of Great Britain.
Morgan of Alabama, who yesterday of
ferred a resolution declaring the abroga
tion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty be
tween the United States and Great Brit
ain, addressed the Senate for nearly two
hours upon his proposition. His admoni
tions to Great Britain were particularly
sharp. He declared that if Great Britain
should endeavor to enforce the terms of
the treaty the effort would result In a war,
in which the great empire, which had con
trolled for scores of years the commerce
of the world, would be swept from power
and her King would be'left with only sov
ereignty over nls own Island.
Teller said he lind'no desire t/> enter ob
jection to the reference of the amendment
to the Committee on Rules. That was the
proper place for It. He inquired, how
ever, if there was any expectation on the
part of the majority to do anything more
during the present session than executive
business. ,
Pending an answer to that question Vice
President Roosevelt announced Jn a low
but distinct tone that the proposed
amendment would be referred, in the ab
sence to objection, to the Committee on
Rules.
Change of Rule Deferred.
WASHINGTON, March 6.-Agaln to-day
Vice President Roosevelt was the central
figure of the" opening proceedings, of the
Senate. "When he appeared at his desk to
call the Senate to order a .wave of ap
plause swept over the thronged galleries.
He evidently was impatient at the dem
onstration, and sharply tapping his desk
with the gavel warned the spectators
that a repetition of the applause would
result In an order to clear the galleries.
*Matt of Connecticut then called up the
amendment to the rules, of which he gave
notice yesterday, relating to the limitation
of debate. After the amendment was read
Teller of Colorado inquired of Platt
whether or not he expected to secure ac
tion upon the amendment at the present
extraordinary session.
Platt replied that he did not desire to
discuss the proposed amendment at the
present time. He wished to have the
amendment referred to the Committee on
Rules." but he doubted very much if the
Committee- on Rules could consider it so
fully, as to enable the Senate to take ac
tion upon It' at 'this session^
"Ihope." said' he. in* conclusion, "that
some fair amendment to the rules may be
deVlBtd by which there "can be a reason

VANCOUVER. B. C. March 6.-LleU
tt-nant C. Mahcw Arnold of the staff of
the admiral of the British fleet In Chinese
waters has just returned to Hongkong
from Manila. He traveled extensively
through the Philippines and claims to
have had an opportunity of sizing up the
whole situation in the American posses
sions from an independent military man's
standpoint. He pays:
"I believe that after all the Americans
will complete -heir campaign before the
Pritish ao in Pr>uth Africa. The fee'ing
among all classes Is that this spring will
eee the conclusion of hostilities, and I am
certain that by June or July of this year
the war with the Filipinos will be prac
tlcailj; at an end. The natives have lost
heartâ what few there are in the populous
districts who ?re still holding out. The

"Now the conditions are different. The
military {rovernment has now fully 500
permanent posts and parrisons through
out the aTchlpelsgo. Kach one of these is
a renter nf activity, from which scouting
parties a^d email detachments are strik
ing in all directions. The nati\ r es are in
terror of the severe policy inaugurated,
â¢which practically means to give no quar

"There is I the greatest activity in all
quarters, not only in killing and wound-
Ing, but in the burning of hundreds of'
barrack* and ateelters and huge stores of
rice and provisions, which are kept by the
native* for the rainy months. Numerous
villages and barriers are being wiped off
the face of the country every week. If
the wsr is kept up for long it will mean
the extermination of the Filipinos as a
race."
Japanese papers received to-day by, the
Fteamfr Empress of India give full de
tail* of the occurrences leading up to the
arrest by the military police of Manila on
February 7 of D. M. Carman and Senor
C'arranza on the charge of aiding the ln
eurgents. The two men under arrest did
business in the Philippines as contracting
agent?" under the firm name of the Car
man Company. By means of letters of In
troduction and influential friends Carman
was said to have obtained permission to
po at will between the lines. This privi
lege gave him 3a immense advantage over
other Manila merchants, and it is charged
that he utilized this ' opportunity to
transact an immense business with the
Insurgents, selling them supplies and stor
ing tor them copra and lumber, which he
was paid to have sold to advantage for
the insurgents, putting $6,100,000 into their
coffers. Carman's frlonds declared * he
would establish his innocence at the trial.

PARIS. March 7. -The report that John
Wilson Durant of Albany. X. Y., who had
been living during the last two years in
Paris with his mother, had befcn killed at
Ostend in a duel with a Russian Count,
was an Invention of his own. Durant Is
FtlU alive. Xo duel was fought. The
whole story was a pure fabrication.
Durant and his mother were found last
over.lnr at the Kuston Hotel In London.
When interrogated on the subject of the
report of his death he was greatly taken
aback, and exhibited extreme agitation at
the revelation of his scheme.
Finally." resolving upon a frank state
ment, he explained that Jie had had a f=e
iious quarrel with Mile. Mangin, his be
trothed, and had determined to break off
relations with her. He said he considered
the best exit from the difficulty would be
to die, at least officially, and that his
trouble with the Russian, which was
real, offered the easiest solution of his
entanglement. Therefore, he took advan
tage of this method of announcing his
death.
He admitted that he enlisted the serv
ices of a trusted friend here to secure the
Insertion of a death notice and he ex
pr^sped the preatest chagrin and surprise
that the Btorjr had leaked out. When
pressed regarding the alleged duel he de
clined to discuss the matter, saying:
"I received the kindest treatment at the
hands of the ItUEStan and I don't wish to
cause pain. I had hoped the plan would
puccecd. Intending to remain officially
<Vad for three or four months, thus giv
ing my betrothed a plausible explana
tion."
Two letters had been received in
Paris from Durant. one dated Os
tr-nd, March 3, and the other Lon
finn, March 4. In the former he
asked the recipient to make certain per
sonal arrangement-? and to forward his
mall to Glasgow, care of "P. S. Peat."
KHvinpide. and in the latter he exposed
himself by say inc. after requesting that
a change be made in the arrangement
Fupeested in the first letter and that his
mail be forwarded to London, "You will
know that I officially died yesterday.

HEARING AN END
These letters are In Durant's own hand

to establish conclusively the fact of a
duel. The first cle*r was the following
NEW YORK, March Â«.-The financial
embarrassment of John F. Searles. one
of the organizers of the American Sugar
Refining Company and until ' yesterday
president of the American Cotton Com
pany, it was said to-day is purely per
sonal and will "not involve any of the
eighteen corporations with which he Is
connected, either as president, treasurer,'
secretary, director or trustee.
Mr. Searles 1 liabilities it', is believed
will reach about $3,100,000 and are covered
by his assets, which, however, are main
ly unlisted stocks and are therefore not
readily marketable or of a negotiable
character. If not pressed by the creditors
and sufficient time is granted Assignee
E. Dwight expects to be able to, pay Mr.
Searles' obligations in full.
Mr. Searles was at his office to-day but
he would not talk concerning his assign
ment. Pending the action of the board of
directors of the American Cotton Com
pany on the resignation of Mr. Searlea,
which was filed before his assignment was
announced, the affairs of that corporation
are now beinR managed by Vice President
William C. Lovering, who was called here
from Boston, and D. C. Ball, the general
manager.
Statement of the Assignee.
Assignee Dwight said to-day that .the
schedules of assets and liabilities are be
ing prepared, and as soon as they are
ready will be- submitted to the creditors
and "a period : of time to liquidate Mr.
Searles' affairs will be asked for.
So far as could be learried to-day no
out-of-town institution is involved in Mr.
Searles' breakdown. The Searles assign
ment was precipitated by proceedings in
stituted late on Tuesday afternon in the
United States Circuit Court in Brooklyn
to recover the principal and interest on
overdue and unpaid notes aggregating
$70,000. The papers In the case were filed
by William Cook, an attorney. He said
that there had been no secret about the
legal formalities taken . to recover the
money and that the papers were regularly
filed with the clerk of the Circuit Court.
All the notes were given on July 12. 1900,
and were made payable in six months at
6 per cent to the Duluth Furnace Com
pany of Duluth, Minn.-, and the judgments
are recorded for Thomas R. Thomas of
that corporation. The first note was for
$20,000; the second, for a like amount/had
been transferred to the American Ex
change Bank of Duluth;. the third, for
$10,000. had been indorsed and made pay
able to the Western Reserve Bank of
Warren. Ohio, and the fourth, for $20,000.
was transferred to the First National
Bank of Duluth.
Cotton Company Not Affected.
. Mr. Cook said that the papers " were
filed in the United States court in Brook
lyn because Mr. Searles resided In that
jurisdiction and Thomas Is a resident of
another State. William C. Lovering. vice
president of the American Cotton Com
pany, made the following statement at
the offices of the company to-day: -,"
"John F. Searles resigned yesterday the
office of president of the American Cotton
Company, and as vice president I am now
acting in his stead pending the election of
his successor. The American Cotton Com
pany is not affected in any way by Mr.
Bearles' assignment, as the company had
no connection with his arrangements. His
assignment, which was made after .his
'resignation had been received, means
nothing whatever to the company." U
That Mr. Searles had struggled for a
long time to continue solvent in spite of
several crushing mishaps was made clear
by several developments to-day. His rela
tive prosperity suffered early last year in
the collapse of the American Fisheries
Company and the bankruptcy .of his son
in-law, Albert B. Roeder. But as long
ago as January. 1899, when he ceased to
be treasurer and secretary of the Ameri
can Sugar Refining Company and presi
dent of the Western National Bank, .the
assertion that he was a millionaire
through his Intimate relations with -the
, sugar trust was disputed by those who
should have intimate and inside knowl
edge of the facts.
According to Wall street ideas \:Mr.
Searles still holds securities representing
at least one-third of his former fortune,
but they are so tied up and hedged about
that he cannot dispose of them without a
sacrifice, which an assignment would ob
viate. It is said that when the wreckage
of his fall is cleared away Mr. Searles
will still have enough to live on comfort
ably. A matter of speculation In Wall
street was the holding of Mr. Searles'
paper and collateral. Much of It, It. was
believed, is held in Baltimore and other
Southern cities.'

death notice appearing in the European
edition of the New York Herald:
"DURANT-At Ostend, Belgium, March
3â John Wilson Durant."
The attention of the American consulate
was called to this nnd an Investigation
was immediatclv opened which revealed
the following ffiegram written in Frenclt
that had been received by Durant's be
trothed. Mile. Laure Mangin, yesterday
morning:
"OSTEXD (undated)â My friend Durant

the second letter on his arrival there. The
hotel people assert that some one tele
phoned Monday and asked whether Du
rant's body arrived.
Up to last evening all the Information
tended to show that he had carried * out
his alleged intention and been killed.
Doubts arose when dispatches came from
Ostend asserting tliat there was no trace
of a duel there, that nothing of the sort
had been heard of by the police, doctors
or hotel people, and, moreover, that no
deatl* had occurred there of any person
named Durant or "Carter," the name un
der which Durant had announced ho
would travel. Investigation in Pnrls then
brought to light the receipt of the two
letters, which reveal the fact that Durant
was responsible for the whole dramatic
story. â¢
Sweetheart Is Surprised.
Durant has been without occupation and
has lived extravagantly. He had an
apartment at 95 Boulevard St. Michel, to
which he sent the death telegram ad
dressed to his betrothed. Mile. Mangin
belongs to a poor family. He introduced
her among his friends as his betrothed,
and a notic* appealed in Le JournaJ Feb
ruary 16 announcing the betrothal," in
which It was stated that the marriage
had been fixed for the second fortnight in
March. Possibly he reconsidered this In
tention and conceived the duel story as
a loophole for separation.'
When Mile. Manpin. her sister and
brother-in-law were called upon yesterday
regarding the matter the women express
ed the greatest astonishment at the ab
sence of any confirmation of the death
telegram. Mile. Mangin's brother-in-law,
who declares himself a better judge of
Durar.t. hit the nail on the head by ex
pressing his belief that the telegram was
a "stupid humbug."

During the session just closed the de- I

they have been persistently denied. The
river and harbor bill has been permitted

Numerous Demands Ignored.
Cause of Deficiencies.
The large deficiencies provided for the
fiscal year 1S99 by tlie first -regular session
of the Fifty-fifth Congress as amounting
to $349,772.3S9, were almost In their en
tirety to cover the expenses of the mil
itary and naval departments during tho
fiscal years 1899 and 1900 incident to the
war with Spain. ' 5 -
The most marked increase indicated in
the appropriations for ordinary expenses
of the Government made, for the two
years 1901 and '1902 at the sessions of this
Congress over those of the two preceding
years, provided for by the Fifty-first Con
press, Is for the postal service. The neces
sity of these increasing appropriations to
meet larger business demands Is referred
to as a cause for congratulation. The ap
propriations have been reduced $128,150,091
by this Congress under those provided by
Its predecessor, and this has rendered pos
sible a reduction of taxes in the sum of
$41,000,000. By the continuance of the wise
administration now enjoyed by the repub
lic there is every reason to expect further
reduction of expenses, and especially of
taxes. \
Mr. Livingston says the Fifty-fourth
Congress was the last one that made ex
penditures for the support of the Govern
ment prior to the beginning of the Span
ish war. The Fifty-sixth Congress Is the
first to appropriate for the support of the
Government since the close of the Spanish
War. The difference between the appro
priations made by the Fifty-sixth and
those made by the Fifty-fourth Congress
is $395,4S2,272.
WASHINGTON, March 6.âRepresenta
tive Cannon, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Appropriations, and Represen
tative Livingston, the senior Democratic
member of "the committee, has prepared
statements of the appropriations for the
Fifty-sixth Congress which will be print
ed in the Record to-morrow. Both place
the total appropriations at $1, 4 10.062,543.
placing those for the first session at $710,
150,862, and- for the second at 5729,911,683.
Mr. Cannon-publishes, a table showing the
expenditures of the previous Congress at
$1,568,212,637,' and Mr. Livingston makes a
comparison with the Fifty-fourth Con
gress, which appropriated $1,044,580,273. In
his' statement Mr." Cannon says:
"The appropriations of the session Just
closing aggregate as nearly as can be as
certained at this time. $729,911,683. This
sura includes $123,732,688 for the postal
service and $537,000,000 for * the sinking
fund. The Increase over the appropria
tions made at the first session of this
Congress is less than t20.000.000, and the
sum is more than -accounted for by tne
increase of $10,124,450 made on account of
â¢the postal service, and by $13,513,037 in
the bill- that provides for the maintenance
of our navy, and for the construction,
armor and armament of the new ships of
the navy.- One large Item Is the appro
priation of $5,520,000 authorized by legis
lation at the first session of thi3 Congress
for the St. Louis Exposition.
Reduction of the Taxes. â¢
The total appropriations made at the
two sessions of the Fifty-sixth Congress
are $128,150,092 less than the appropriations
made during the two regular sessions of
the preceding Congress. The revenue bill
passed at this session will. It Is estimated,
reduce taxes for the coming fiscal year
$14,000,000. bringing our total estimated In
come for the coming fiscal year, Including

CZAR'S POLICE
TRAMPLE CROWDS
Students Are Crushed Under
j Hoofs of Horses in St.
Petersburg.
Sixty-one new arrests were recently
made at Kleff. The Government has de
cided not to make a political affair of thÂ«
attempt made on February 27 by Peter
Karpovlch upon the iife of the Minister
of Public Instruction, M. Boroliepoff ,
when, Karpovich shot the Minister
through the neck while the latter was re
ceiving petitions at the Ministry of Pub
lic Instruction. Karpovich. who was for
merly a student at Dorpat University, will
be tried on March 20 by a court repre
senting all classes of citizens. The penalty
for this crime will not exceed fifteen
years' imprisonment.
It Is learned that Professor P. N. Melu
koff, the celebrated, historian, author of
a three-vplume "Historv.of .Russian Lit
erature" nnd of- a "History of the Period
of Poter the Great" nnd also editor of the
Russian edition of the Forman Encyclo
pedla. was taken into custody on Febru
ary 11 for participation in a conference
between liberal citizens and 150 students,
called to consider matters relating to stu
dent life and to start a petition to the
Czar. The manuscript of this petition was
found in Professor Melukoff's house. Pro
fessor Melukoff was ! dismissed several
years ago from Moscow University for lib
erallsm. He was afterward professor of
world's history at Sofia. Recently he re
turned to St. Petersburg.- . - â¢ - Â¦

The police were in charpe of Lieutenant.
General Kleiget, the Prefect of Police,
who, when he rode to the scene of iha
trouble, was hooted bv the students and
their sympathizers. Another report saya
that professors from *.he high educational
schools were among the gathering of male
and female students- who assembled on
the.Nevfky Prospect nnd that the stu
dents petitioned the clergy to hold spe
cial services in memory of Alexander II,
but the cler&y refusfd to do so on the
ground, that they had not the authority.
Meantime the petitioners were'surround
ed by the police, who d!d not seem awara
of the object of the demonstration, but
inferred it was seditious.
Tho police were warned beforehand and
twenty-five delegates from the various St.
Petersburg higher educational Institu
tions were arrested Friday night fpr meet
ing to consider student affairs. ;
Police Prefect Is Hooted.
At noon a thousand- male and female
students srathered in and around the Ka
san Cathedral on the NeVsky Prospect,
where mass for the reoose of the soul of
Czar Alexander II was being- celebrated.
After the mass the students began sink
ing: and the police gathered in great num
bers. The students wore surrounded and
driven In a crowd toward the City Hall,
not far away and also or. the Nevsky
Prospect. Â»
For no special reason the police began
beating the students and tramping them
under the feet of their horses. The
Nevsky Prospect was filled with spec
tators. The banks and business houses
were nearly all -closed with shutters fast
ened and doors locked. The spectators
and the women students screamed with
horror, but the police kept up their at
tack on the students until 400 of the lat
ter were driven Into the courtyard of thd
City Hall, the others escaping into the
crowd. The entire city was horrified by
the conduct of the police.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 4.-To-day
was the fortieth anniversary of the eman
cipation of the serfs. The students had
been planning for some time .to keep Jt
as a holiday and perhaps to make some
demonstration, but no particular plans
were made.

CONTAGION AND INFECTION.
I>n Grippe Is Infectious but Hot Con-
tagious.
Contagious diseases aro communicated
from one person to another: infectious
diseases are conveyed through the air.
Smallpox Is a contagious disease; La
Grippe is Infectious. When an epidemic of
the grip Is prevailing It Is In tho air we
breathe, and no one is safe.
The only safeguard Is to keep the sys-
tem In the highest possible condition of
health, and on the first appearance of a
cold In the head to use some safe antisep-
tic like Stuart's Catarrh Tablets freely.
A tablet taken every hour or two for a
couple of days will be sufficient to break
i the attack.
La Grippe attacks the weakest part of
the system; it may be thÂ© lungs, heart,
liver, stomach or kidneys, but wherever It
finally locates it almost invariably starts
with cold in the head and throat, or. In
other words, the disease at the beginning
Is acute cartarrb.
This Is the reason Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so successful In break-
Ing up attacks of grip. The antiseptic
properties of the remedy destroy the
germs before the whole system Is thor-
oughly Infected.
Dr. Annlston says: Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, being free from cocaine and
harmful drugs, should be freely used at
this time of year on the first appearance
of grip symptoms.
They check the excessive catarrhal
secretions, stop the fever and prevent
pneumonia.
They are composed of antiseptics and
may be used by little children as freely as
by adults and with great benefit.
Dr. Lewlston says: My usual prescrip-
tion for the grip is Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets -which can be found at all drugstores.
Keep to the house for a day or two and
use the tablets freely, and I have never
heard any complaint of failure to cure.

Davis, whose generalship. In the
management of the China Basin
lease ratification bill carried It to
victory In the Senate, had this to
sajvof the hard and well won fight:
"This splendid victory of the
Senate has proved a principle? for
which I have always contended;
that any railroad company can ob
tain just consideration of _- its
rights without going Into politics.
It need have no bureau of political
henchmen, and ned not be afraid of
the Legislature if It will keep Its
hands off party organizations,
whether Republican or Demo
cratic. The conservative men of
all parties can be trusted .to have
the courage to treat corporations
fairly and there need be no fear
but they will rise to the occasion
when large measures are laid be
fore them simply on their merits.
"This Senate will stand by 8an

to her great opportunities In the

Js a question of the welfare of the. State. I
have been told by Senators upon this floor

whom th*y had Ill-feeling. Oh. â¢ how I love
such patriotism, ituch. statesmanship! " To see
great questions affecting the welfare of a apm
monweaJth decided not upon their merits, not
Then Smith turned his attention to the
motives which, he said, were behind the
bill, and he laid the lash of his sarcasm
and his keen logic over the backs of the
opposition until they o.ulvered. In part he
said :
1 cannot see how that should bother this
Senate. If the Santa. Ke docs not build a
tstawall on the outside it will have to build
a retaining wall on the inside line, which is
just as costly and not nearly as valuable.
Why ehould we worry whether the Santa Fe
will do the- wise or the foolish thing?
Wolfe Â¦ interrupted to ask what would
occur. If the Santa Fe filled In the Inside
twenty-four acres nnd refused to build
the seawall as required under the terms
of the new lease. Smith replied:
This would make the expenditure for the
first year of SC3.G00, or, as I figure It, an aver
age of $45,125 a year. And If the State did
the' work "It" wouid have to care for It. but
under the lease the State will practically re
ceive more than $13,000 a year, no expenses for
maintenance, all wharf and dockage privileges
and tolls, and the property itself at the end
of fifty years.
And It Is objected that it will be twenty
years before the .State, can build tha seawall
down to the leased property and so acquire It.
But that means It will be twenty years be
fore the State can drop a rock In the China
Basin, while under the lease the State will
get It already filled In twenty years, -or as
much sooner than that as she wishes to extend
the seawall. Isn't that a good business prop
osition? . . "
Ststa "Will Be Gainer.
I concede that if the State were in a position
to fill in the China Basin It could drive a
harder bargain than It could under the terms of
the lease; but is It policy to grind this down to
the last farthing? For who pays It? Come
down to my office and I'll show you who pays
seme of It. In every shipping bill there Is an
Item "State bills." It is the same thingâ the
people pay It In the *-nd. Â¦
Tne Santa Fe engineers estimate that to flll
in China Basin in accordance with the terms
of the~i*Â»SÂ£ would cost $1,000,000. Under the
system of public works, the State could not
do It under $1,250,000. Xow, the proposition
Is that the Santa Fe shall pay $30,000 and re
turn the property In fifty years. Suppose the
State should undertake to do It. First, there
would be a bond' Issue of $1,250,000. At 3 per
cent this would demand Interest amounting to
$37,500 a year.. With this would be $1000 rent,
which the Santa Fe must pay, and $25,000 or
one-fiftieth of the principal which would go to
thÂ« - sinking fund. ..
there is tide water on the other side of the
bay. San Francisco has no monopoly of tide
water facilities. Ships do not have to tie up at
the foot of Market street. They can go across
the bay, and tneir railroad can establish a ter

Railroads Hake a City.
. Referring to the statement that rail
roads would pool 8nd â¢ stop rate-cutting
Smith said: "
It fs too much to expect that the railroads In
the West shall always be cutting rates. They
must fix rates oh a merchant must fix his prices
and. through competition, the rates will be
worn down Just as prices are worn down In
trade. In the East, where the country is
bounding along with tremendous strides, they
are not continually cutting rates. Compare San
Francisco to St. Louis. Cincinnati and a dozen
other Inland cities that are growing Â¦ with In
conceivable rapidity, only, because of their rail
roads. Wherever you see steel rails converge
there you will find prosperity and people. You
can no mere build a city without railroads than
you can build a railroad without steel.
I warn the Fan Francisco members to-day
that If the Santa Fe is driven out of that city.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â The Senate
chamber Is still ringing with the
oratory that carried to victory the
bill ratifying the lease of China
basin. It was an all-day's battle. In
which words i:nd parliamentary points
were tossed from side to side until excite
ment was at fever heat. And it ended in
the night session. v.ith the galleries and
the lobby crowded and ladies forming a
Bood half â¢ of the crowd who saw and
heard and applauded.
The brunt of the fight for the bill was
borne by Smith of Kern and Davis- of
Amador. For the first time In the session
Smith strode out into the aisle and turned
his logic, his keen wit and his biting sar
casm upon his opponents, without thought
of time and sparing no one. For forty
minutes he tore the theories of the oppo
sition to rags. He spared them no leg to
stand on and left their arguments shiv
ering In the cold blast of his reasoning,
and then he 'mpugned the motives of
some of the members of the opposition
and flayed them with his invective. Davis
closed the debate In a speech that made a
fitting though fiery companion for Smith's
effort of the morning. Then the roll call
sent the bill through with plenty of votes
to spare.
When the bill came up in the morning
Wolfe offered the first of a series of
amendments he had preparedâ one to re
move a clause relating to former leases.
A debate followed, in which it was agreed
that the bill should "stand or fall by lteelf
âthat the discussion should be on the
merits of the measure and that no amend
ments should be offered. The way thus
being opened, Wolfe spoke against the
bill, attacking the amount of the rental
demanded, the terms of the lease and the
proposition, as he described It. to make a
lease of the last of the water front that
amounted to a perpetuity.
Smith Defends the Bill.
Devlin spoke for the bill and satd he
would vote for it because the people want
ed It and ex-Governor Budd vouched for
It. Selvage declared himself In favor of
the measure. Cutter opposed It, saying It
was an Infamous measure and that he
would not vote for It were he the last
man In the State.
Then Smith of Kern entered the debate
like a twelve-Inch rifle among a lot of
rapld-firers. He generally speaks .from his
desk, drives a knife Into what he opposes
or throws it a rope If he favors it. and sits*
down. Hut to-day he -took his time and
the center of the aisle, and when he closed
there was really nothing more to Be said.
He said In part:
The history of this State has been the history
of one Ion* battle between the people and the
railroad. The attitude of San Francisco has
always been one of fierce antagonism, . but I
think it will be seen that these cities of the
Btate which have dealt fairly with the railroads
have found the railroads have dealt best by
them, and San Francisco is beginning to reallie
that she has lost millions ot dollars because of
her attitude toward the railroad. This city of
Eacratnento owes Us existence, almost, to the
chops that were driven away from San Fran-
Cisco because of the opposition to the railroad.
I think If any one looks back over the history
of the xtrugKle between the railroad and the
people he will decide that the proper course
would be to reverse the policy of all
these years; but here we find another railroad
the San Francisco delegation it Is meeting the
same kind of opposition that has cost the city
bo much.
Every business man of the city Is pleading
with us â pleadlnr with us to assist them to be
<*>m>- a commercial people and at the same time
thÂ« representatives from there are, with but
few exceptions, opposing this. I have seen the
San Francisco delegation moved as by a finger
from th^ city at the behest of some labor or
ganization, tome laundrymÂ»n'Â« union; but when
the commercial element expresses a wish the
Ban Francisco delegation opposes It or acts upon
its own opinion.
When the Valley road came down through the
San Jonquln at Bakersfleld we all hoped that
tone day It would become a connection for
some tranÂ«contlnental railroad, and we rejoiced
when It became part of the Santa Fe. \

Oneal was among the "ayes when the
vote was announced because he changed
from no to aye In order, to give notice of
a motion to reconsider. It- is understood
Welsh would have voted for the bill had
he been present.
"The time has passed," . he declared,
"when any demagogue can climb to prom
inence on an antl-rallroad cry. -We would
give the lease to any railroad If it kept
out of politics as this railroad has kept
out of ft. They can have anything that,
In fairness, they can ask for."
He then went over the Important pro
visions of the lease, which were inserted
to protect the State'? interest, and closed
with a thrilling appeal In behalf of the
commercial progress of the city. The roll
call that was the aim of all the lighting
was as follows:. i'-^.*. '
An adjournment to evening was taken
and then Lukens. spoke for the bill.. Oneal
tried to get Davis to agree to an amend
ment providing for the submission of 'the
lease to the people, but Davis would say
nothing until he was allowed his Closing
argument, so Oneal subsided and Davis
rounded off the day with a speech that
rang through the Senate chamber like a
trumpet and brought a burst of applause
that -would not stop even at the rap of
the president's gavel. Davis referred to
the relations between the Republican
party and the corporations, saying it was
the party's policy -'.o show fairness to all
and fearlessness -and honor In dealing
with them.
Senator Davis' Kinging Speech.
Ashe followed In support of the measure
and then Rowell supported It, although
he said he did not think It good policy.
The consideration of the bill was passed
over the recess and the hour and a half
(for the Assembly hie and when it came
up again the opposition had decided on a
different course. Oneal submitted an
amendment providing that no Chinese or
Japanese should be employed In the work
of lilling In the basin. It was'opposed by
Davis and Sims as being an attempt to
kill the bill Indirectly when they could
not kill It directly, but Smith of Kern
closed the debate with the point of order
that the. bill was to ratify and not to
make a lease and therefore the amend
ment was not germane. The point of
order was ruled "well taken" and the
discussion proceeded. Sims and LÂ«ardner
spoke for the bill. Shortridge afld Wolfe
spoke against It. Wolfe wasting most df
his time In a vain effort to answer "the
Senator from Kern."
San Francisco Is the center' of this na
tion, but lend the Santa Fe away and then
watch the north and the south grow. Send this
road away and other roads headed for this
coaFt will go elsewhere, and a feeling of mis
erable petty spite will wreck the prosperity of
a people.
Warning to San Francisco.
with regard to the benefit of the community,
but out of a petty, personal feeling against
some man whom th-y wish to Injure. It Is a
spirit no man would dare to stand before
this Senate and admit, no man would be will
ing to openly claim as his. own.. This Is not
the United States of America, It is the linked

be based upon a better spirit than Is shown
here. It is miserable, It Is despicable. It /Is

third reading to-day, but was amended

School Salaries Bill Amended.
Anderson also spoke in opposition . to
Fisk's amendment, bu: before a vote was
reached the time for consideration of Sen
ate bills expired and the whole matter
was left over as unfinished business, for
consideration to-morrow. . -
Foster spoke at some length against the
amendment and quote.l from a letter by
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler to Sena
tor Lukens in which this bill was called
the most important of the university bU'<?
and asserting that unless some means of
permanent Increase in revenue for main
tenance be provided it would be advisable
to establish tuition fees.
Fisk precipitated a fight to-day on Sen
ate bill 539, the act" providing for a con
tinuous appropriation for the University
of California, by the Insertion of an item
of $200,000 in the general appropriation bill
biennially during the next ten years.
Fisk's fight was not made In an unfriend
ly spirit toward the university, but be
cause he believed the bill was an attempt
to bind future legislaturesâ an impossible
thing.
Fisk offered an amendment striking out
the figures "$200,000" and inserting the
words "a sum sufficient for the support
and maintenance of '.he institution." lit.
believed such an amendment would make
the bill less objectionable on the ground
Just stated and also would leave latitude
for an Increase in appropriation from ses
sion to. session.
To Amend University Bill.
In caucus a motion was made to accept
the Senate bill, but it was defeated, the
vote being 23 ayes to 26 noes. Some harsh
criticism of Senators for attempting to
Ignore the Assembly in the matter of As
sembly district apportionment was ex
pressed, and a motion to adopt Duryea's
amendments prevailed by a vote of 30 ayes
to 9 noes.
James had offered an amendment to the
Los Angeles apportionment, but It 'was
voted down without compunction, though
the Assembly enjoyed his speech.
Duryea offered the amendments to the
committee amendments, which were aft
erward accepted by the , caucus. Irish
spoke in favor of Duryea's amendments,
saying that a Democratic district had
been formed for ; himâ a district that
would make a 1200 mile ride by buggy
necessary to get from one end of it to the
other.
On motion of Anderson the bill and its
amendments were made a special order at
11 o'clock to-morrow.
James of the Seventy-third District, the
only Democrat in the Los Angeles delega
tion, made a humorous speech on the
manner In which his district had been
gerrymandered. He said that from a
compact city district it' had been changed
to a shoestring twenty-four miles long
and about three inches wide. This had
been done in order to put the Soldiers'
Home, with nearly 2000 Republican votes.
In the district to overcome the Democratic
majority of the Eighth Ward. He likened
the shape of the district, which he showed
on a map, to a monument set to com
memorate his political demise, and to a
grandfather's clock, Â¦which Carter of the
Apportionment Committee, mindful of
"Alice" and the Assembly clock, had
blocked out.
James Grows Humorous.
The Assembly.' took up the Apportion
ment Committee's amendments to the
Senate bill this morning. The essential
change proposed by the committee was to
strike out all of section 2. relating to As
sembly districts, and to insert instead the
scheme embodied In the Assembly bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â After a long contest
over the apportionment bill to-day the
Assembly made that ' measure a special
order for to-morrow at 11 o'clock. At
4:30 p. m. the Republican majority cau
cused and agreed upon amendments
which insure the passage of .the bill so
far as the Assembly is concerned, but
whether the Senate will concur Is another
question. â¢ *
The Assembly will leave the Senatorial
districts as fixed in the Senate bill. In the
Assembly districts San Benlto loses its
Assemblyman and is put in the Fifty
ninth District with Monterey. El Dorado
is taken from Placer, leaving an Assem
blyman to the latter county alone. Ama
dor and Calaveras are put in the Eleventh
District, and Alpine. Mono and El Dorado
are grouped in the Fifty-eighth District.

Having Fun "With Brady.
Brady's telephone bill (Assembly bill
379) barely failed to pass the Assembly
to-night and there is a good chance for It
to obtain the necessary forty-one vote*
on reconsideration to-morrow. The bl'-l
was put on final passage without debate.
A call of the House was necessary and
after a half hour of horse play with ab
sentees who were brought before the bir
of the Assembly th*Â» bill had 39 aye3.
Brady changed from aye to no to give
notice of a motion to reconsider an.l
eighteen members followed suit for tha
fun of watching the consternation deplet
ed in Brady's face. The vote as finally
announced â 21 a3*es to 47 noes â Is not an
index to the Assembly's attitude on the
bill.
Ralston called up Assembly bill 873. on
the third reading 'file, out of order this
afternoon, and on his motion It was
amended to conform to thÂ© aETeement
which had been signed by the Big Basin
Lumber Company. By the amendment tha
Redwood Park Commissioners to be ap
pointed under the act are compelled to
select the land for the contemplated pa>k
from "that tract of lan.l commonly known
as the Big Basin, situated In Santa Criu
and San Mateo counties." This gives as
surance that the $230,000 cannot be divert
ed from the purpose by the
leaders of the movement for the preserva
tion of the. giant redwoods of Big Basin.
The Assembly to-dayi passed the game
protection bill, which/ in the form in
which it will go to the Senate, permits
of the killing of but three deer by any
one person In a season and absolutely
prohibits the salp of quail. No game may
be shipped out of the State and only fifty
ducks may be killed by a huntsman In a
day. the sportsman's "bag" of quail be
ing restricted to twÂ«fnty-flve. These are
the features of the bill.
LYNCH BOBS SOME LOBBYING.

Represents the Bosses Who Seek to
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 6.â John C. Lynch, United
States Internal Revenue Collector, is here
as the agent of Doodling bosses to oppose
the ratification of the China basin lease.
For a long time he has been neglecting
his duties as an officer of the Federal
Government to concern himself In affairs
of State legislation, and now with shame
ful audacity ' and conceited recklessness
he is working against the commercial in
terests of San Francisco. It would be on
a par with his previous performances In
Sacramento if he should exhibit bogus tel
egrams and seek thereby to create the
impression that the merchants and busi
ness men of" the metropolis were demand
ing that the leate should be rejected.
Lynch la known to be the superservlce
able agent of boodllng bosses, ready to re
sort to any scheme of fraud to mislead
legislators. lie is "cheek by jowl" with
Martin Kelly and others of the boodiing
type who have been planning in secret for
the past month to stand up the Santa Fe.
Leading Republicans who have observed
Lynch's continued neglect of official duty
and noted his silly pretensions to"spÂ«Â»ak
for the Republican party, talk of urging
Senators Perkins and Bard to take Im
mediate measures to terminate his career
as an officer of the Federal service. It
is known that Perkins vigorously pro
tested against Lynch's conduct in seeking
to defeat J. HÂ« Nelson, the Republican
nominee for State Senator In the Twenty
fifth District. Lynch also worked indus
triously to defeat C. M. Belshaw. Repub
lican nominee for Senator in the Eleventh
District: Wherever he expressed a pref
erence the voters defeated his preferred
candidate, but yet Perkins and Bard,
agreeing that he was a disturbing ele
ment of the party .and should be removed
from office, failed t& agree as to his suc
cessor.
The story Is now circulated that Senator
Perkins, who conce'led the appointment
to Senator Bard. Is holding out to Lynch
a promise of reappolntment. Public men
who know the temper of the people of
California assert that Perkins will not
dare to arouse such opposition to himself
as Lynch's reappointment would provoke.

It is a dngular thing that in the
popular view of disease the interde-
pendence of the several organs of the
body is lost sight of. The heart, for.
example, is diseased and it is treated as
if it -were entirely separated from, 'and
Independent of, evcrr other organ. N
The fallacy of this opinion is shown
by the cures of heart "trouble," liver
"trouble," kidney "trouble" and "other
ao-called 'â¢troubles," effected by the use
of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery. Primrily the "Discovery" is a
medicine for the cure of diseases of the
stomach and blood. But it cores dis-
eases of organs seemingly remote from
the stomach, because these diseases have
their origin iu a diseased condition of
the stomach and its associated organs
of&digestion and nutrition.

PLASMON is the most digestible and nutritious food known
' to medical science.
PLASMON is a light powder made from fresh milk, and is
Â¦"-" albumen in its purest and 'most natural form.
PLASMON is a muscle building, nerve sustaining food,
easily digested and immediately assimilated by .the
most delicate system.
PLASMON in wasting diseases, chronic affections of the

it was impossible for me to see the crib

RICHARD was not himself at Tan
foran yesterday alternoon, for
out of six races Dick Dwyer
made three poor starts, sqme
thing exceptional and not with
in the field of exculpatory sympathy.
Twice he left the great, the only, the pre
mier Jockey of America, J. Todhur.ter
Sloan, at the post. Sloan said It was the
fault of Mr. Dwyer. Mr'. Dwyer said it
was all due to Mr. Sloan's dilatory post
tactics. At any rate J. T. Sloan made a
mournful churning of the waves and saw
fields of poor ones sauntering homeward
to a warm fireside while he waa out in the
snow, shaking with the winter chill of a
fog-ridden valley. â¢
When Sloan was left at the post he was
on top of Seide, second choice, and Amelia
Fonso, something long in the betting. But
that was not all. Twjce he knotted him
self with Winnie O'Connor, and both
times this wizard of Tanforan turned his
head like the title of a forgotten novel
and gave the unctuous to America's fore
most saddle performer by reputation. The
fog that floated In on Tanforan yesterday
shrouded both Sloan and Dwyer, but the
latter's defection was exceptional. Sloan's
has become a habit.
Winnie O'Connor, mounted on the favor
ite, had the extreme pleasure of seeing
Tommy Burns' back at the finish of the
first race. MacLaren, a 2 to 1 favorite,
Â¦was talked of as easy money, but Gold
Baron. Tommy Burns up, made MacLaren
look like 16 to 1 money. Santa Lucia ran
down the backstretch as if a load of hay
were In front, but when the. time, to get
anxious came -Gold Baron and MacLaren
passed Lucia.
A sufficient number of. hot tips floated
about the ring before the second race to
carry the Great Eastern around the world
three several times. When the three and
one-half furlongs of footing was finished
Escalente, 25 to 1, put the money In the
vest pocket and said mean things to Dan
Collins, another wildly whispered name,
and Snooze, the favorite, that made the
show. Of the eleven entries eight were
touted to win.
Then came O'Connor on Toah, who beat
Ada N out In the stretch, j Toah was fa
vorite, Selde, Sloan up, second choice.
There was nothin? to six furlong
canter but Toah. Sloan reveled In the
aftermath of a bad start.
In the fourth race for four-year-olds
Tommy Burns on Redwald beat Doublet
and Our Lizzie for first money. Llzzi-a
was heralded as the real thing, but she
disproved the good things said of her.
Parmenion,,the favorite, piloted by O'Con
nor, was a bad fourth, never tasting the
money
The mile race for three-year-olds and up
Trent to Nansen, af:er . a clever bit at
riding by O'Connor. Sloan and Tappan
looked at the ( finish. Good-by Sloan;
Nansen won by two necks. Saintly, with
the man with the fiery name on top,' got
the TBhow.
In a field of eleven O'Connor, on Hara
lamb again beat Sloan, mounted on The
Gafilr, the 2 to 1 favorite. Once more
these two Jockeys had the tail of the
performance to themselves and It was all
day with J. Todhunter.
BY LOUIS HONIG.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
THE horses ran strictly to form
at Oakland yesterday, the attend
ance was good, and there was an
abundance . of coin circulating'
about the ring. So evenly balanced
were the fields that while four of six
extensively backed choices made the wire
in front the majority of the books quit
with the balance en the right side of the
ledger.
Johnny Bullman and Owen Mounce ap
peared to .most advantage in the way of
riding winners, each being adorned with
brackets on two occasions.
a curtain raiser eleven platers lined
up at the barrier in tho live furlong
scramble. Because Bullman rode Ting-a
ling the filly was played to 13 to 5 favor
itism. She did not meet with the best of
luck, running unplaced. At the' start
Batan, a 20 to 1 shot, rushed away In the
lejid, but tired before . the town clock
hove in sight, and Mounce on Aluminum
won easily.
Caesar Younp's useful mare Good Hope
looked to hold Montallade safe in the six
furlonp run next decided, and received
substantial support at 6 to 5. Although
Montallade led for a quarter the favor
ite, with Domlnick In the saddle, passed
him when ready, scoring easily at the
f tand by half a length in 1:14. Alaria out
stayed Montanus for the show.
" Generally conceded the sweetest morsel
on the menu, the price" against Glenden
ning in the speculating done on the two
year old spin speedily fell from evens to
1 to 2. After a tiresome delay at the post
the youngster quickly showed in front of
the bunch and cakewalked home. Evea G,
a 100 to 1 shot, trained by "Jimmy" Cof
fey, ran second throughout, beating Lou
welsea for the place.
While beyond question the best, Her
culean, the 3 to 2 favorite, played in luck
or his number would never have been
flashed as winner of the mile and a hun
dred yards selling (affair. Pocketed at the
stretch turn in fofcrth position, .Alleviate,
Norford and Rio Shannon went wide, al
jowlng Mounce to skim the rail." Down
where the money is hung up the favorite
disposed of Rio Shannon easily by two
lengths. . Domlnick could not keep Nor
ford at his work, though finishing a close
third. Essence acted sour at the post,
and in the race refused to extend himself.
Absolutely outclassing the other start
ers in the seven-furlong run, decided un
der selling conditions, 4 to 5 against Gi
braltar, seemed like visiting a bargain
sale. The black horse acted very gentle
manly for him, shook off .his company at
the start and smiled in more than a
length ahead of Grand Sachen. Old Vas
sal pegged along diligently, which earned
for him show honors, as Maydine became
afflicted with heart failure.
Through some medium gtill unknown by
those who fell to the tip. Looram closed
favorite for the last event, a five-furlong
dash. The aged gelding appeared drowsy,
Dcminick couldn't awaken him and he ran
last. Overtaking Lady Newinn in the
stretch Midlove. with Fauntleroy up. was
returned a clever winner. Â¦"Handrldins"
Kelly on Nettie Clark got the show.
Track Notes.
As Yellowtail was entered in the hand
icap through a misunderstanding, the
three-horse race at Oakland to-day has
been declared off, the management stat
ing they do not wish to disappoint the
public. An extra race to close at 9 a. m.
has been substituted.
The Barnett starting gate was given a
thorough trial at Ingleside track last Sun
day with very satisfactory results. A fea
ture of this device for dispatching horses
Is the barrier which works automatically
on ball-bearing wheels, returning to posi
tion If run into by any of the starters.
C. H. Williams, a well-known Eastern
turfman, died at Oakland Tuesday night
of hemorrhage of the lungs. Two years
ago the deceased horseman, who was the
owner among others of Tame Irishman,
was a man enjoying robust health.
Walter Hobart was reported to have
purchased Lady Newlnn, a bay mare by
Rey del Sierras-Boleta. after the last race
at Oakland. She is eligible to the pony
class and very fast.
The San Francisco Jockey Club an

Grand Jury Resumes Investigation
of Alleged mismanagement of
Police Department.
The Grand Jury met last night and re
sumed the investigation Into the alleged
mismanagement o f the Police Department
in connection with Chinatown affairs. The
testimony given by the witnesses ex
amined tended to show that the Chinese
gamblers have been operating: In a bold
manner for several months past and that
they have been relying upon police pro
tection.
Jerome Millard. a Chinese interpreter,
â¢was the first witness called. He testified
in substance the same as he did before the
legislative committee. He testified that
he heard Chinese gamblers say that they
could run their games openly, aa It was
understood that they would bo raided
periodically by the police. When ra'ided
the dealers were to plead guilty and the
fines -imposed would be regarded as a li
cense. ' Â¦.- : ' â¢- â¢_
Chew Moy. who is said to be one of the
largest owners in the Chinese lottery
games, waa kept on the witness stand for
fully half an hour, but no. testimony of
importance was obtained from him. Ho
avoided all direct questions asked him by
answering that he did not -understand
English.
' Fred Armstrong, a newspaper reporter,
was examined at length concerning the
violation of the laws prohibiting lotteries.
He testified that lottery games were run
ning in the Chinese quarter and that a
,new lottery company was organized and
went Into operation while the legislative
committee was conducting its investiga
tion.
The Jury will meet again to-morrow
afternoon to resume the investigation.

Mayor Phelan, Chief Sullivan and
Commissioner Newhall Talk
Over Proposed- Changes.
Mayor Phelan. Chief Sullivan and Po
lice Commissioner Newhall held an in
formal meeting yesterday and discussed
the various questions agitating the offi
cials of the Police DoDartment. The ques
tion of the vaccination of the police ofll
cerR caused quite a lengthy debate and
while no definite action was taken it was
practically agreed that it was hardly nec
essary except in the cases of the officers
on duty where smallpox prevailed. It was
determined to leave the matter in the
hands of the police sureeon.
The question of benefits to be derived
from the installation of the eight-hour
watch for patrolmen was Riven much at
tention. As the tqnV of duty is at present
almost the entire force is on every night,
but with the proposed change carried out
only one-third of the officers at present on
the force will be available for night duty.
While the change meets with the approval
of the Mayor, the Chief and the Commis
sioners, no decided action was taken.
JOHN D. FRY'S WILL.â The will of the late
John E>. Fry was filed for probate yesterday.
Decedent bequeaths one-half his estate to his
widow, Sarah T. Fry, and the other half to hi8
son, Robert D. Fry.
t< "^ DWARD FLOOD, a harness
_v cleaner, employed in the Fash-
ion Stable on EH13 street, and
*4 his wife and two children were
severely burned early yesterday
morning by a flre in their home at 637A
Natoma street. One of the children, a
two-weeks-old baby, may die. The or
igin of the fire Is a mystery. Flood, who
works at night time, returned home
shortly after 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, and at the request of his wife went
into the back yard to stretch a line to
dry the clothes she had washed the day
before. While botfi of them were in the
yard" Philip Dohoney, a butcher's clerk,
noticed smoke issuing from the kitchen
window. He tried to open the front
door, and, finding It locked, rang the bell.
The fire was confined to the room in
which It originated. It broke out in a
clothes closet. It may be that matches In
the clothing of Flood were accidentally
Ignited. At the time that it broke out
both children were asleep. The four-year
old, daughter, Elizabeth M. C. Flood, is
burned about the feet, while her two
weeks old brother is burned about the
head and face. Flood and his wife are
also burned about the head and face, but
their burns are slight.
One of them, the youngest, slipped out of
my arms when I was getting out of the
room. Mrs. Flood was a few feet behind
me and saved him. We are both badly
burned, but I do not fear any serious re
sults to ourselves. I am afraid that the
baby I dropped may have inhaled the
names and that his tirst relief will be in
death."

Smttb played a steadier came than any
of his opponents and wÂ«U deaerved hla
victory. He and Bell went round thÂ»
course In company, while Riley played
with Horace Rawllns and Johnstone with
Harry Rawllna. About a dozen ladles and
a score of men watched the games, rra> : :
of them going round with Smith and Bell.
Almost immediately after the game Smith
and Bell left the iinks and are now on
their way to Los Angeles, where they will
play In the open championship tourna
ment to be held on the links of the Los
Angeles Country Club. Though Davi.l
Bell took a higher place than Willie Smilh
in the open championship tournament oi
the United States last year Smith has al
most continuously beaten Bell during
their tour in California. The general opin
ion of those who haye seen the profes
sionals play at Oakland and the Presidio
is that Smith is the more steady, certain
player, though Bell makes many brilliant
strokes. Both Smith and Bell said that
the fair green of the Presidio links is the
best that they have seen la California or
the South.

JUST one pirl Trt:h a summery-look

Â¦went on their pilgrimage around

o\it with such precision that the visiting
Ehrlners were warm in their expressions

There was not a ripple on the surface
of the bay nor a trace of fog to obscure
the landscape when the steamer James
M. Donahue pulled out from the Union
ferry depot shortly after 10 o'clock in tne
morning- ar.d moved slowly around the
hay to the accompaniment of a big brass
band that had been brought aboard to
help enliven tilings during the trip. All
the points of interest about the bay were
pointed out to the visitors, beginning with
the Union Iron Works. The Wisconsfn
lying- In the stream dipped her colors as
the excursionists swept by and the salute
â¢was returned by the Mystic Shriners, who
pent forth a reverberating cheer for tho
pallant crew that lined the decks of Uncie
Sam's latest fis-htlngr machine.
Commissary Wilkfns was the most pop
ular man aboard the beat. Lemonade for
the lad'es. zemzem water for the men ar.d
lunches for all were his contribution to
the er.joymcr.t of the occasion and the

A ehort stay *rsis made at El Campn,

.Frederick and Anna Meinhold are again
husband and wife. Upon the order of
Judge- Seawell a writ of mandate was is
sued yesterday morning directing County
Clerk Deane to Issue a license authoriz
ing their remarriage. Upon the issuance
of the writ a license was forthwith Issued
by Deputy County Clerk Danforth, and
within an hour Justice of the Peace Dan
iels had again united Frederick and Anna
Meinhold. Together, leading their baby
boy Freddie by the hand, the once more
happy couple left the City Hall, leaving
benind them a precedent which says that
though the Superior Court of this city
and county is divided as to the right of a
divorced person to marry other than a
former husband or wife within a period
of one year from the date of the decree, it
stands as a unit as to the right of divorced
couples to again marry each other within
that period. .
' When the case was called before Judge
Seawell yesterday morning Chief Deputy
County Clerk Goddard, representing tho
County Clerk, rose and presented his
views upon the issues Involved in the case
at.bax. Mr. Goddard said that he did not
wish to occupy the position before the
court of being antagonistic to the peti
tioners, but an apparent ambiguity of sec
tion 61 of the Civil. Code and the evident
lack of clearness in the expression of opin
ion by former and present members of
the Superior, bench of this city and county
had caused the County Clerk to refuse the
application of the petitioners for a license
to wed.
"The right of divorced couples to re
marry within one year, the limit of the
statutory prohibition. Is apparent to me,"
said Mr. Goddard, "but .the right of the
people to the upholding of the laws which
their representatives have seen fit to en
act .is. equally to be considered. Xhafa
natural and moral right for these people
to remarry exists I cannot deny, and all
that we ask your Honor is for a judicial
interpretation of the statute under which
this license was refused. -This given and
if in favor of these petitioners, it will af
ford them not more pleasure than it will
me in order that they be qualified to wed
and again return to their own fireside and
the comforts of their old home."
Judge Seawell immediately decided that
the petitioners were entitled to the writ
as prayed for, and he made an order for
Its Issuance. Mr. and Mrs. Meinhold
thanked Mr. Goddard for his action In the
case and were more grateful to him than
they would have been had he issued them
a license at the time of their original ap
plication. Had the license been issued
when they called for it, they said, they
would have always been in doubt, In view
of the provisions of section 61, as to- Its
legality. Now there was no question as to
the legality of their marriage, hence they
were happy.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce were granted yester
day to Irene C. Thompson from Otis C.
Thompson for cruelty and F. Drapinskl
from Mary Drapinskl for lnfjdellty.
Suits for divorce were filed by Henrietta
T. Walton against Charles Walton for
failure to provide and Bertha Meyer
against Richard Meyer for cruelty. Ber
nard Bernstein ha-"} sued to annul his mar
riage to Gussle Bernstein upon statutory
grounds.
After Hearing Views of Chief Deputy
County Clerk Goddard Judge
Seawell Issues Writ of
Mandate.

While many people have been cured ot
chronic catarrh by a single bottle of Pe-
runa, yet as a rule when the catarrh be-
comes thoroughly fixed more than one
bottle is necessary to complete a cure.
Peruna has cured cases Innumerable of
catarrh of twenty years' standing:. It la
the best. If not the only internal remedy
for chronic catarrh in existence.
But prevention is far better than cure.
Every person subject to catching cold
should take Peruna at once at the- slight-
est symptom of cold or sore throat at thi3
season of the year and thus prevent what
is almost certain to end In chronic ca-
tarrh.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman. giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratis.
Address Dr. Hartman. President of The
Hartman Sanitarium. Columbus. Ohio.
Mrs. A. Snedeker, Cartersvllle, Ga.,
writes:
"I saw that your catarrh remedy, Pe-
runa, Â¦was doing others so much pood

weight. I now feel â¢
that I am well of all my troubles."â Mrs.
A. Snedeker.
The best time to treat catarrh Is at tho
very beginning. A bottle of Peruna. prop-
erly used, never falls to cure a common
cold, thus preventing chronic catarrh.
They have come to regard Peruna as In-
dispensable to their success. Their pro-
fession is so exacting that It requires per-
fect health In every particular. They re-
gard Peruna as their friend and safe-
guard.
Many letters are received from this
class of people. Miss Carrie Thomas, a
prominent actress of New York City, in
speaking of Peruna, says: "I have used
Peruna with splendid results. Would not
be without it. No money would hire me
to have a settled cold or chronic cough, or
hoarseness. Catarrh is the most dreadful
thing that could happen to one of my pro-
fession. Peruna is my shield and protec-
tor against this most undesirable dis-
ease."â Carrie Thomas.
The season of catching cold Is upon
us The cough and the sneeze and the
nasal twang is to be heard on every hand.
The origin of chronic catarrh, the most
common and dreadful of chronic diseases,
is a cold.
This is the way the chronic catarrh gen-
erally begins: A person catches cold,
which hangs on longer than usual. The
cold generally starts In the head and
throat. Then follows sensitiveness of the
air passages, which inclines one to catch
cold very easily. At last, the person has
a cold all the while seemingly, more or
less discharge- from the nose, hawking,
spitting, frequent clearing of the throat,
nostrils stopped up. full feeling in the
head and sore, inflamed throat.
Many people can tolerate slight ca-
tarrhal affections. A little hoarseness.
a Blight cough, a cold in the head, or a
trifling derangement of the digestive
organs, do not much disturb the average
person in his business.
But this Is not true of the public
speaker or stage artist. His voice must
always be clear, lungs perfect., digestion
undisturbed. Hence the popularity of
Peruna among the leading actors and
actresses of this country.
"I have used several bottles of Peruna and feel greatly benefited j
thereby from my catarrh of the head. I feel encouraged to believe that â¢
if I use it a short time longer I will be able to fully eradicate the disease I
of thirty years' standing." â David Meekison, Member of Congress. ?
------ ' '*
- Hon. David Meekison Is well known, not only in his own State, but throughout
America. He began his political career by serving four consecutive terms as
Mayor of the town In which he lives, during which time he became widely known
as the founder of the Meekison Bank of Napoleon. Ohio. He was elected to the
FJfty-fifth Congress by a very large majority, and Is the acknowledged leader of
his party In his section of the State.
Only one flaw marred the otherwise complete success of this rising statesman.
Catarrh, with its insidious approach and tenacious grasp, was his only unconquered
foe. For thirty years he waged unsuccessful warfare against this personal enemy.
At last Peruna came to the rescue, and he dictated the following letter to Dr. Hart-
man as the result:

Mindful of that evil deed and its sorry results, we say
frankly to all intending settlers: Be careful when you
buy land, and don't buy at all until you know the qual
ity of the soil and its adaptation to the use to which,
you intend to put it. Don't believe any story you hear
ab6ut roast pigs running around this State begging
people to cat them. While it is true that the con
ditions of life and toil are 'easier here than in the ex
treme summer and winter climate of the East, it is
also true that faithful labor, guided by intelligence
and knowledge, is just as necessary to sitcccss Â¦ here
as it is anywhere. .V^m >
So far this cheap travel has produced no appreciable
results because of a strange oversight. of the Southern
NOTICE is out that all the overland roads will
follow the Southern Pacific's suit and give a
low rate for colonist, or settler, excursions
from Missouri River points. This will include all the
lines to Oregon and Puget Sound points, and will re
sult in a large amount of cheap travel. What its
effect upon the increased settlement of the scctioh in
tended to be favored will be remains to be seen.
There is no reason why it should not produce an ac
ccss of -very desirable population. With the excep
tion of Southern California no part of the Pacific
Coast has heretofore 1,-ecn exploited by the railroads.
The method now adopted- has long been used for the
benefit of all the country between the Great Lakes
and the Rocky Mountains, and has been a prime fac
tor in rapidly developing a population of many
millions. The cheap rates to the coast will not
produce as large a population of settlers to the
whole travel as in the case of that territory,
because the scenery and the glamour of romance
on this coast will induce a large num
ber of the merely curious to take a cheap excursion
for merely sightseeing purposes. In the prairie States
there were no sights lo sec, and cheap ratos to them
carried only those who went for the practical purpose
of bettering their condition by settling and making
homes. But, canceling out the sightseers, we should
still receive a great many permanent settlers, and if
they are properly guided to make good purchases and
their lot with us proves happy they will make a large
body of useful missionaries for California who will
continually attract hither their old friends and neigh
bors in the East. This matter of proper location an!
future contentment should be the object of every
Californian who comes in contact with these new
comers. This State is not peculiar in the instances of
land-sharking that have injured it. T^ie settlement
of a splendid colony of Hollanders on hard pan land
near Merced, in which many honest people lost all
they had, is something for which the State should
THAT COLONIST RATE.
Now that all fears of an extra session of Congress
aie about over there seems an easy and open way for
the President to make his long promised visit to the
Pacific Coast this spring, so we might as well get
ready for a grand welcome. \
In all the wide world there is no forest that better
deserves preservation than that of the Big Basin.
Even if it were remote from human habitation it
would still be worth l.ccping as a natural marvel, ami
when once its beauties were made known thousand 1
of people would travel many miles for the purpose of
passing a holiday amid its groves. It happens, how
ever, that the forest, ro far from being* remote, is al
most at the gates of San Francisco. It. is near thÂ«i
center of the population of the State; In a time not
far distant it will be accessible to a million people
for use as a holiday ground to which they can go and
return within a day. Such being the case, the argu
ment for its preservation is irresistible.
Civilization, with its work and waste, its enterprise
and its recklessness, is rapidly stripping the Pacific
Coast of the mighty trees that have excited the won
der of all travelers and the admiration of scientists
ever since they were first made known to civilized
men. With each succeeding year the sweep of de
struction by ax and saw and fire becomes wider, and
the forests are almost like smoke. It is
time that something be done to conserve tke forests
as a whole and to save the remaining groups of giant
trees so that they may serve as great parks for recrea
tion and for instruction for all time to come.
r* ROM Sacramento comes the cheering report
'that the passage of the bill designed for the
preservation of the great redwood forest in thi
Big Basin of the Santa Cruz Mountains seems now
to be well assured. Tt is to be hoped the bill will not
be defeated, sidetracked or overlooked in the rush of
the closing days of the session. It is a measure of
great importance to the State, since it aims at preserv
ing for generations *e come one of the chief glories
of California â one of the forest wonders of the world.
BIG BASIN PARK
Here, at any rate, is a negligence, or worse, thu
appe_ri to be the fa/ilt of the managers themselves.
I5y refu/mg to carry on tlie search they save _ few
<io!lars for the company, and for the sake of that they
are willing to have the Rio where she sank regard
less cf every duty resting upon them to assist in the
lTovcry of the bodies of the dead, and their property
which may be of value to the living. . .
In this, as in other instances of a similar nature.
the managers will shift the blame of the loss of the.
s'camer upon the pilot or some employe of the com
pany; but upon whom can they shift the blame for
the neglect to prosecute the search for the ship?
Whose fault is it that the search was dropped nfte- so
small an amount of work and expense? By whose
neglect hes it come about that ever since Saturday th;
efforts to find the Rirt have been confined to private
panles?
Apparently the Pacific Mail Company has long ago
reached the conclusion that the public has no rights

Wreck after wreck has taken place among its vessels,
but it has learned nothing from them, and seemingly
it has not even tried *o learn. When a vessel goes down
thÂ» company scratches the name off the list of its ships
_n<! goes on in the same old wzy. Thus each new
C'raster furnishes a<ld;d reason for public condemna
tion of the company's methods of doing business.
This neglect on the part of the company adds an
other to the many bad phases of the accident. It ap
pears the compan3' is indifferent to the dead, to the
loss of property and to the menace which the sunken
ship constitutes to the navigation of the channel.
After a litt'e display of zeal in making the search the
company abandoned the work in absolute carelessness
whether or not some ether vesfel might run upon
the masts of the sunken Rio and receive serious in
jury.
UT 1IILE the horror of the wreck of the Rio was
I fresh in the public mind the Pacific Mail Com
pany made a show of searching for the wreck.
K datives of those who were lost in the sunken vessel
trusted that the efforts of the company would brin^
them at lean thÂ« bodies of their dead that they might
receive decent burial, and that the -baggage of tht
jjassengers containing perhaps many articles which the
Uving would cherish as mementos of the departed
would be recovered. All such trust in the company
was in vain. After the first display of activity the
search by the compmy was abandoned. All efforts
row being made to locate the wreck are carried on
by private parties. Since Saturday the Pacific Mail
corporation has done nothing.
PACIFIC MAIL NEGLIGENCE.
It will be remembered that in the office of Secre
tary of State Sherman gave way to Day, and the lat
ter soon retired, to be followed by Secretary Hay.
In the office of Attorney General McKenna gave way
to Griggs. Postmaster General Gary retired after a
comparatively short time .and was succeeded by
Smith. The Interior Department passed from the
control of Bliss to that of Hitchcock, and in the War
Department Algcr gave way to Root. Thus during
his first term McKinley had three Secretaries of State,
two Secretaries of War, two Secretaries of the In
terior, two. Postmasters General and two Attorneys
General. After such experience the public can well
understand why the President should be eager to re
tain with him for the coming four years the men
whom he has tried in office and found to be at once
harmonious and efficient.
To the people also will the reappointment of the
former Cabinet be gratifying. The work of each of
the officials has been as pleasing to the public as tj
the President. The administration of the great de
partments of state has been carried on with singular
success. There has been no scandal nor any sign of
weakness in any department. " Public business has
been attended to with zeal and intelligence. The pub
lic welfare has been carefully guarded, and progress
and improvement have been made along all lines of
governmental work. It is therefore a matter for gen
eral congratulation that the new administration is to
be. in almost every respect the same as that whicli has
given the country so much prosperity in the past.
It is not an easy task to bring together a Cabinet
whose members work harmoniously together and ar_
one and all acceptable to the public by reason of their
administrative ability and popular sympathies. Dur
ing the early part of his first term the. President had
proof enough of the difficulty of the task. Tor one
cause or another his Cabinet underwent many and
frequent changes, and as a consequence the work of
administration was impeded and unsettled in many
respects.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY has been fortunate
in being able to retain for his new term of of
fice all the members of his Cabinet with one
exception, that of Attorney General Griggs, who,
while consenting to remain for the present, has an
nounced an intention to retire in April. The coun
try"will be well satisfied with the continuance o4,the
former (^abinet in office, and it is hardly necessary to
_3y that to the President himself the matter must be
one of great gratification.

Illâ SLEEP AND SLEEPLESSNESS
1^ would be Impressive if I could begin
by saying that Insomnia, like Insanity and
nervous prostration, is on the Increase. It
Is my Impression that Huch In the cas.?.
but how difficult to prove It! Insomnia ia
a. .minor symptom, not' an Infectious dls-;
ease, and therefore does not get Into the
health reports. But it Is one symptom o.
insanity. which disease seems to be slight
ly increasing, and alsu of nervous pros
tration, about which nothing was heard
forty years ago. It is caused by overwork
âand American overwork. It Is caused by
excessive smoking, and we ' use more t>
bacco every year per capita. It Is caused
by those changes In the arteries which
come on In advanced-. Jfe, and, the life of
the modern man being longer, we havo
more hard arteries than we used to. have.
It is a symptom of the nervous constitu
â¢tutlon, and the nervous constitutionâ to
s.iy nothing of nervousness about the con
stitution â is greatly in _vidence nowadays.
It is a malady of the town rather than:
of the country, and our population is be
coming an urban one. Seventy years ago
there was none of {he eo-ca lied *Ieei>
producln& drugs which are now retailed
across every druggist's) counter. In the
I old days the only- things which could be
used to produce sleep were opium, whlcn
isJVIangerous and uncomfortable; henbane
nnd hemp, which are uncertain. and^Tie
ill-smelling nervine*, which are of little
real use. .The production and sale of .hyp
notics- Is now -on an enormous scale.
Every few months son_d new. compound
drug is being evolved from the laboratoiy
and exploited In the medical journals.
This could hardly be the case unless there
wore a great number of persons wno
wanted something to make them sleep.
So tfiat it seems a reasonable â¢ conclusion
that people do not sleep now quite as we'l
Â«s their grandfathers used to do. I am
not, however, a pessimist In regard to thj
future on this point. Being an intelligent
people we will in time diHcover that In
somnia Is a bad thine to have and .that
tho struggle for subsistence and success
cannot bo carried on. If a person does not
Bleep; and consequently measures will bo
taken to adjust ourselves to the situation
bo. that this unpleasant condition will b^
gradually > diminishedâ In other words,
while we may have more Insomnia for
the next half century eventually we will
probably learn how to live so, that there
will be loss of it. ' Â¦
Mental Activity and Insomnia. â¢
Besides, the coming man. apart from
any question of sleep disorder, will prob
ably obtain IÂ«*Â«s sleep. The more highly
organized nnd specialized structures have
to keep awake more In order to maintain
tho delicacy of the equilibrium. At the
present time the feat* of normal continu
ous mental actH-lty have been done by
men of the higher brain type. Napoleon
had not slept for three days when he
reached Parla after .Waterloo. He could,
it is said, go without sleep almost Indefi
nitely. And one reads of many similar
featH of persistent vigilance among men
of great and active talent. Insomnia and
a tendency to short hours of sleep are
more common among brain workers,
especially among the intellectual and ar
tistic type as distinguished from those of
administrative and executive powers. As
the organism becomes more settled In Its
habits, more automatic and machine-like
in its work. It get* more rest. .But the
world is not getting into this state,
among the progressive â¢ races. Indeed,
races (hat do not suffer from Insomnia
are cither at a standstill or are dying out.
All tbe organs of the body do their work
more or less rhythmically and sleep is the
resting phase of the brain's rhythm. It
takes up one-third of each twenty-four
hours. Some organs, like the heart, rest
half the time, the lungs ;i little more than
half: the healthy stomach has about the
samo amount ot leisure. The brain may
thus be considered as compared with
othrr organs^to be worked overtime.
But sleep IS not alone a period of rest
for the brain; ail the organs of the body
shiire it in a measure. The heart beats
moro slowly and quietly; the breathing
la alÂ«o slower; the temperature of the
hotly Is less, and the chemical changes of
nutrition slacken.
How Sleep Clears the Brain.
Sleep not only supplies rest: It la the
tlmÂ« when the circulatory organs, the
veins; arteries and lymphatics, put In a
special kind of work nnd In a way scour
and clean up, carrying off the waste pro
ducts accumulated uurlng the day's ac
tivity. For during the day the brain ce}H
are continually undergoing chemicHl
changes. The results of these changes
accumulate. They are called "fatigue
products" and their presence In the brain
causes a feeling of weariness and drowsi
ness. During sleep rheso cell changes are
slower, the blood vessels- carry off the
fatigue-products, so that the brain
awakens with decks cleared for action
again.
During Bleep there Is le-n blood In the
brain. The nrnounl is always less than
during the waking life, but It varies ;i
good deal. A slight noise, a strong odor,
a pinch of the skln-aM send a little more
blood to the brain, though the sleei>or may
not be Bwakenefl "jy It. This sensitive
ness of the circulation is necessary. It is
a sort of protection to the sleeper from
passing Into actual lothargy. Just as tho
slopping person nwnkr>ns the brain be
comes for n momoni particularly poor In
blood, and nonce tho moment of waking,
especially If ' accompanied by a sudden
movement, makes one confused, dizzy or
l'aint. 1 hnvo known pertnotm who were

Amount of Sleep Required.
Sleep Is most essential in the two ex
tremes of lite. The new-born Infant
sleeps most of tho time, or ought to. Up
to 10 the child Bhould sleep about twelve
hours: from 10 to 20 he requires nine or
ton' hour*; the mature man should get
along with eight hours, and In old asro
rlx or seven hours is enough at night,
though a nap during the day is helpful.
Woman, it Is agreed, need3 an hour moro
sleep than man. but on tho other hantV
sho seems to bear the loss of slespr better 1
than man.
Theso rules are subject to a good many
variations. I have known a man of fine
ami active intellect who, all his mature
life, slept only four hours in each twenty
four. On the other hand some, more
of ton women. Inherit a tremendous ca
pacity for sleep. They can sleep twelve
hours every night, nnd take a long nap
In the daytime; if. they -get -a' chance. -
A person can go .'without sleep just
about as long as ho'can go without food
that is. twenty to forty days. But peo
ple cannot ordinarily go without sleep for
more than three days without serious
symptoms. Those who think they do not
â¢lccoat nil arc mistaken.
COPYRIGHT, 1901.
By Dr. Oiiarles -I_. -Dana.
Persons of nervous temperament do not
sleep quite so much as those of the op
poxite type. This is true, though not uni
formly so. of nervous children. It must
mean that this class of persons does not
need quite bo much sleep. The repara
tion powers are greater; the tissues build
up sooner; the circulation i_ more active.
They work more quickly and rest more
quickly. Nevertheless, this class needs
the sleep it getÂ» even more than others,
and It is especially Important that it gets*
Into regular habits of taking sleep. If
such people lose Bleep they eventually
break down and easily get to suffering
from sleeplessness. This la A warning
which parents of nervous children should
take. People steep more, and more pro
foundly, in cold and temperate climates
and at lower altitudes. The inhabitants
of high, dry regions. . like the Colorado
plateau, or simply very dry, windy re
gions, like those of Minnesota and the
Northwest, suffer from . insomnia.
Going to Sleep and Avoiding Dreams.
The theory of the cure for sleeplessness
Is based on these facts: The great nerv
ous centers of the brafn are being con
stantly battered by stimuli from the va
rious sense organs,, the viscera and tne
Internal etlmull of stored up thought and
feeling. These nerve centers rest in sleep
by aecuring as far as possible a respite
from these irritations. Shut out from the
spinal cord, for. example, impulses to
make Its centers act and' it sleeps^ This
is at once accomplished by lying flat on
the back and keeping quiet. Â»mrt out
from the conscious mind the stimuli, xrom
the eyes, the ears, the nose and as far
as possible from the skin end viscera, and
there comes a tendency to sleep. The ex
periment was trle_ on a young man who
had lost all his senses but hearing. By
stopping his ears with wax he would at
once fall to sleep. Now we can exclude
all these Irritations fairly well, and ordi
narily it is done when one goes to bed.
Unfortunately, we cannot control the In
ternal stimuli of thought and feeling and
not always those of extrinsic origin. So
worry or the desire to .solve problems In
affairs or disorders of the body keeps the
sleepless man tossing on his bed. But to
exclude the sensory stimuli from the brain
as far as possible is the object which Is
aimed r.t. : ; '-" /
We owe it to a dream that Galen be
came a physician; that Esculapius pre
scribed dates for consumption, and that
more important events of history took
place. There are to-day persons who be
lieve in the significance of dreams and
others who get perhaps esthetic feelings
out of them. But I consider that dreams
on the whole are unhealthful and that
perfect sleep Is dreamless. Dreaming Is
no doubt more common now and less af
fects the imagination than It used to do.
The cult of Esculapius for sixty years
wa3 based on the production of dreams,
which his followers to-day seek to abol
ish altogether. Dreaming Is usually a
matter of Indigestion, pain or worry, and
it occurs in the lighter phases of sleep
that Is to say, at its beginning or ending.
How 'to Get Sound Sleep.
Sleep is not affected by the, mag-netlo
currents of the earth, and one sleeps
f-qually well with his head to the north
pole or south pole, and with the bed on
glass castors or on copper conducting
rods, with the feet free or connected by
a wire to a pail of ice water, as advised
by the exploiters, of a certain proprletary
"cv.re."
Persons sleep beet In the positions most
comfortable to them. Most persons sleep
on the side, and oftener the right side,
but people with "livers" are incited to
sleep en the left side and those with Irri
table hearts on the right side. Some
physicians advise those who have poor
blood to sleep without a pillow and those
of plethoric habit to sleep with the head
well raised. The popular Idea that sleep
ing on the back causes bad dreams has
some justification In fact. Young chil
dren, according to llenoch. a learned Ger
man authority, ought to sleep, and gen
erally do. with their arma bent and held
to the sides so that the hands are near
the chin, somewhat in the position as
sumed during Intra-uterlne life.
There are many forms of sleep disturb
ances, but the term "Insomnia," or sleep
lessness, is the most common and dis
tressing and includes most of the others.
The coming man must have sound, rest
ful sleep or he will not be able to do his
work.
To sleep well Is largely a matter of
habit and the most important thing for
a man to do who is starting- in life If he
wishes to avoid insomnia Is to form the
habit of going to bed at a certain time
nnd get his body to expect sleep at that
time.
How Insomnia Is Produced.
Insomnia la often brought on by the
practice of working at night and following
thlÂ« up by reading late into the night.
Far be it from me to decry too unspar
ingly a habit which brings much pleasure
anU'intellectual enrichment into life. The
practice of late reading Is not so bad
If It la temperately indulged In. Twenty
or thirty minutes devoted to some work
which quiets the mind, pleases the fancy
or adds a little- store to knowledge may be
helpful. Ptolemy, king of Egypt, was ad
vised "to use honest actions during the
day and have divine and celestial medita
tions in the evening," and It makes a Rood
prescriptlon for sleep. Amlel s Journal,
Emerson, "Sartor Resartus," St. Augus
tine Marlus the Epicurean and the lyrics
of the Bible are good to prepare for sleep.
And If any one were to repeat Sir Thomas
Browne's praedormitial prayer or Words
worth's Sonnet a few times he would not
only wnnt to sleep but have to do so. But
to read Anthony Hope or "The Three
Guardsmen" or the popular novels of ad
venture of the day or polemics or deep
philosophy leads to Insomnia and very un
pleasant nnd dysonelric nights. There are
less serious works that may be used, such
us the old and quieter type of novel or the
three-volume history or books of lelsurely
t ravel. I have a list of sleep-Inducing
works which Is too long to insert here;
I besides, each must find his own.
I Working at night Is bad for those who
have a tendency to insomnia. Happily
this practice is. largely counteracted by
the not altogether altruistic attitude of
the wife, who claims nowadays a3 a right
a certain portion of her husband's time
and society.
I presume that tobacco and coffee are
the only substances in ordinary use which
tends to cause insomnia. A man finds out
for himself very soon wnether he is being
harmed by these things. Alcohol, except
In excess. Is not a cause; indeed the
hearty feeders and moderate drinkers gen
erally sleep well, the hearty feeding being
the main factor. A little food at night
often promotes sleep, especially in the
aged.
Be Happy and Avoid Worry.
It is easy to tjdvise against worry, but
I know of no means of utilizing the ad
vice. Still, worry causes sleeplessness
more than any other single thing and to
be happy Is u very v.urc cure for bad
nights. I must leave it to the economists
the clergy and the cultivators of life's
practical philosophies tq deal with these
sufferers.
Sleeplessness alarms many people. I
find, because they think it Is a symptom
cf impending brain trouble or indicates
the outset of insanity. This Is a foolish
notion which often does much harm. In
somnia is no more a symptom or fore
warning of Insanity that Is headache or
dyspepsia. It is. to be sure, sometimes a
serious symptom in insanity, but one sees
a hundred sleepless people who are not
and never become Insane to one who doe*
And this latter person has signs that
mark his troubles much more sisnifle_ntlv
than does insomnia.
There arc no good drugs for Insomnia
and the world would be better If we hnd

An Interesting Study of How and When to
Sleep so as to Contribute Most to
Perfect Health.
Prepared by Experts and Specialists for
?;i The San Francisco Call
PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
The Call heartily invites the attention of stock
men to the possibilities that lie in the use of these
grasses for reseeding the exhausted ranges and re
rcwing their capacity to carry stock. These plants
can be used where irrigation is impossible, and by
care not to overstock the range may be made lasting
and the cattle business upon it a permanency.
Another indigenous grass that is attracting atten
tion is the gramma grass, once so flourishing in Ne
vada that the Indians harvested its seeds for. grain,
as we do wheat, and giound it rudely to make a sort
cf bread. It is exceedingly nutritious, and by selec
tion is probably capable of development into a new
cereal adapted to arid situations.
The offer of the Agricultural Department to assist
in reseeding protected ranges that have been ex
hausted by use as commons gains great significance
fi om the demonstrated merits of this grass and 'the
possibility of its domestication.
The rediscover}' of its high quality has given a
fre?h impetus to the proposition to lease the. arid
rsnges, to the end that they may be seeded with buf
falo gra?s and protected against its extermination.
Dairy cows" pastur:d on this grass give most as
tonishing returns in the quantity of cream and quality
of butter. â¢ . . -
Now, however, attention is turning back to them.
The buffalo grass, that nourished millions of those
grand animals, has nearly disappeared, without any
examination of its merits and adaptation to domesti
cation. Recently the State Agricultural College of
Kansas lias taken up this native grass and has dis
covered hs merits and peculiarities. It is found that
it propagates not by seed alone, "but the root. The
long, slender roots extend on all sides from the plant
and throw up new plants. Where the plains are not
tramped into dust by sheep, destroying these root?,
the grass spreads independently of the seed, which
explains its persistence when grazed by the buffalo.
It has been experimented with as dry hay to test its
food value for cattle, and was found superior to both
Kentucky blue grass and timothy. It survives the dry
season if the roots are not tramped, and, as cattle do
not tramp them out, is an ideal range forage. Its
seed is easily planted and germinates well.
It is said that the latter was taken into the San
Joaquin Valley by a man who is now serving a long
sentence at San. Quentin. We don't know whether
the charge against him was proved., but it is currently
reported that he was really, found guilty for intro
ducing Johnson grass. That plant is a sort of vege
table cancer. It is the graminaceous lupus. It eat3
everything and is proof against the X ray, salt, fire
and hot water. It will exterminate a vineyard and eat
up an established orchard. But nothing will eat
Johnson grass. Other exotic forage plants as useless
but not as destructive have been introduced in the
quest for something new to add to the bill of fare
of animals that split the hoof and chew the cud, but
native and useful grasses have been overlooked. -
With their domestication all experiment with our
n_tivc grasses seems to have ended, and we have at
fiictcd some parts of the country by the importation
of Bermuda grass, and have distinctly cursed other
parts by introducing the horrible Johnson grass:
It seemed to have been forgotten that many of the
indigenous grasses of this country were found in the
days of, primitive grazing to be of the highest value,
not only in the green state but for hay. The ceh
bratcd Kentucky blue grass, to which that State o.\vcs
its reputation for excellent horses and cattle, was not
a Kentucky grass at all, but grew .wild in Indian?.,
and ,\vas taken thence to Kentucky to become the
toast and boast of its adopted State. The red top
grass, so much valued in moist meadows in the
prairie States, was a wild product of the Upper Mis
sissippi Valley.
While this has been going on attention to our na
tive grasses .has subsided.
________ & j; * â¢'. '. ', '
1'N recent years a great deal of money has been
spent in importing and testing new. grasses, in the
hope to add to the country's; resources for forage.
A NEW GRASS
CHINESE CALENDARâ F. J. R.. City.
How far back the Chinese calendar runs
man knoweth not, for the early annals
of the Chinese empire belong to mythol
ogy rather than to history. The histori
cal period commenced with the Hal, be
gun by Tu the Great about 2300 years be
fore Christ, and the Chinese claim that
there was _ calendar similar to that of
the present date when Tu took charge.
A Chinese year contains either thirteen or
twelve months. In five successive years
there are five Intercalary months. There
Is no distinct name for each month, buc
a month has always twenty-nine or thlrtjr
days. Every year has four seasons, each
season being divided Into six periods
named chalk (joint) and khe (breath), as
follows: First chalk, first khe. second
khe, second chalk, third khe and fourth
khe. Each of these has a significance in
each season. In spring it is: Commence-,
ment of sprin_, rainwater, excited worms,
vernal equinox, pure and clear, trraja rain;
summer â commencement of .summer;
small fall, bearded grain, summer soltice,
small heat, great heat; autumnâcom
mencement of autumn, gathering heat.
'white dew, autumnal equinox, cold dew,
descending of frost; winterâcommence
ment of winter, small snow, great snow,
winter solstice, small cold, gTeat cold. In
the course of fifteen or sixteen days after
great cold comes the commencement of
spring. One of the rules observed by thÂ«
imperial calendar makers Is never to a!*
low the chalk of the winter solstice to
occur either in the tenth or the twelfth
month. "When It falls very near t_e last
day of the eleventh month,, then the next
year must be an Intercalary one.
BY HOOK OR CROOKâ J. VF. B.. Oak
land, Cal. There is no certainty as to
the oiisrta of the phrase. "By hock or
crook." In Marsh's Library, Dublin, there
Is a manuscript written In the seventeenth
century by Dudley Loftus, a descendant
of Adam Loftus. Archbishop Of Armagh,
in which there la: "1172. King Henry II
landed in Ireland this year on St. Luke's
eve, at a place In the bay of "Waterford.
beyond the fort of Duncannon on the
Munster side, at a place called ye Crook.
over a_t the tower of ye Hook; whence
arose the proverbe to gayne a thins by
hook or by crook, it being safe to gayne
land in one of those places when the winda
drives from the other." "Another version
Is that anciently the poor of a manor In
England were allowed to go Into tho
woods to rather deadwood. They wera
allowed to cut oft dead branches with a
billhook or to pull down by means of a
crook any dead branches that otherwise
would be above their reach. This custom
is said to antedate the landing of Kins
Henry II In Ireland.
BETWEEN RELATIVESâ Cupid, C!ty.
The following Is the law of California en
the subject of marriaires between rela

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Pacific people. The cheap tickets have been sold to
San Francisco and Los Angeles with no stop*
oVcr privilege. The holder can come right through' to
this city, but he /will firid the farm lands of San Fran
cisco all taken up. The ranches on Market street and
Russian Hill are not for sale.
These tickets should have stopovers at Sacramento,
Stockton, Fresno and Bakersfield, at Modesto, Mer
ced and Tulare. More than one of the great ranches
in the Sacramento Valley is now being cut up for
sale in small tracts on favorable terms. The quality
of the soil is known and the climate is.there to speak
for itself. The parties interested arc ready to meet
these tourists and take them up the valley, but JVthey
leave the train they sacrifice their transportation to
San Francisco, which they are unwilling to do.
Desirable foothill lands can also be reached from
Sacramento, while from Stockton and other San
Joaquin Valley points the very desirable lands of that
great valley can be reached. What can be more use
ful to California than a chance to see the orange
orchards of Butte and Tulare counties; and the irri
gated lands around Fresno, Visalia, Hanford and
Lakcrsfield? Yet without stopovers these tourists can
Â«ee none of this. They can come to this city, ses
Chinatown and want to die, but as far as any purpose
useful to the State is concerned they might as-well
have staye'd in the March mud east' of the Missouri
River. . â¢ â¢ ; ,

these women, or some of them, arc after
ward found In houses of ill repute, the in
ference has been drawn that reputable
Chinese merchants are In the habit of sell-
Ing their wives and daughters into slav
ery. It has been developed by testimony
taken in court that some of the Chlneso
merchants of the highest social and bust
ness standing have been financially Inter
ested in the profits of houses of ill-fame."

authorities yesterday, but it is believed
that something will be done before the

Chief Dunn of the Chinese Bureau said
that he would obey the Instructions of the

and Federal authorities to suppress the.
practice of buying- and selling Chinese

F. H. LARKED,
Unless hereafter authorized by Congress
this commission will not consider claims
of any other than citizens of the United
States for damages sustained during thÂ»
war. so that the vast aggregate of thj
claims of foreign bond holders and for
eign corporations, such as cable com
panies, steamship companies, etc., will
have to be otherwise adjusted If they
are admitted to treatment r.t all. The
French claims on account of losses sus
tained through French citizens in Cuba
by the Insurrection and the Spanish-
American war aggregate. 13,700,000 francs
and the German claims are probably 'n
excess of this amount.
In form and method of (loins business

abama Claims Commission rather than

Consul General TInoco has received a
copy of Minister Calvo's report. In call
ing attention to it he thinks that the
prime purpose rtf showinsr" that the Costa
Rican coffee Is not as widely known under
Its own name as it ousht to be Is likely
to be subserved.
Costa Rican coffee,' when passing Into third
hands, is sold under the denomination of
Java or Mocha, Its resemblance to these pro
ducts belne evident. While this is considered
to be flatterinp- to the Costa Ricani-. it is to
the Intrresj of Costa Rlea that its coffee should
be known undrf Its proper name to the gen
eral public and particularly to the consumers.
Just as It Is known to. the Importers and tho
general wholesale coffee merchants.
Mr. TInoco referred yesterday to the
report of J. : B. Calvo. Minister for Costa
Rica nt Washington, which has Just been
published In English by the Bureau of tho
American Republics, for figures. Minister
Calvo writes:
Consul General Joseph M. TInoco of
Costa Rica, residing in this city, chargc3
that certain unscrupulous dealers are
taking advantage of the similarity of
Mocha and Costa Rican coffees to charge
consumers a higher "irice for the Central
American product. In his opinion the puo
llc needs instructions concerning coffee.
During the last four vears the world's

CONCERN TINOCO
Throe new companies nro to be Started
in Glenn County, bo that there will be
nine companies In existence in the county
poon. Those already organized are the
following: Glenn County Coal and Oil
Company, the (Sreat Northern Oil Com
pany, the Priscoe Oil and v Mineral Com
pany, the St. John Development Com
pany, the Grapevine Oil and Coal Com
pany and the Sehorn Oil and Development
Company. Two compnnies are doing de
velopment work in Glenn County,
I^nst week, the Ailin Arcus sayn, It was
reported that oil. had been struck In Stone Coal
Valley, of thlB county. The Odarvllle Record
also says thÂ»t there are indications of oil at
many pieces In Surprise Valley, as the sur
face qf the water in Several springs there la
covered with oil. On the ranch of John 1J.
Liinderman these sprlnps exist in abundance,
while there are eevfral of a like ria'.uro on
the land between Middle and Upper Lakea.
about eight miles from Cedarville.. If those
rumorn prove truo, Modoc may enjoy an oil
boom In the future, as there is no reason why
oil may not be found In this part of the State,
if people only go. to the trouble of boring for
It. We have been Informed that when sprlnjr
opens Gilcher Bros., or Surprise Valley, are
planning to bring; their boring machine, over to
this elelo of the mountains and prospect along
the foothills cast of Alturas for oil. Those
who are versed In Reolosry claim that both oil
and coal should bo found in Modoc if the
proper search is made for them.
Many outsiders have visited Randsburg
recently because of the rumors of the
discovery of favorable Indications for oil
In Black Canyon. The Randsburg Miner
says that the place Is south of Pilot Knob
and between the Kno,b and the railroad.
Randsburg and Johannesburg are not the
nearest points, but as those are the only
places where teams can be supplied alii
visitors go to those places. The visitors
are from Bakersficld, Los Angeles and
other oil centers.
Drilling is about to begin on Newell
Creek. Santa Cruz County, about two
miles from Ben Iiomond station.
The oil excitement has now extended as
far north in California as Modoc County.
The Alturas New Era has the following:
The essence of the recent happenings In
Inyo County, according to the Inyo Reg
ister, is that a Bakersfleld man has found
what he supposes to be good indications
on the tablelands north of Bishop, and
that the survey of supposed oil lands
south of Owens Lake Is nearlng comple
tion. The tract comprises 11,000 acres.
According to the Oroville. Register a
well is down nearly 300 feet on the Wlckes
ranch, but a hard formation has been en
countered and progress Is therefore slow.
The Watsonville Oil Company has re
fused, so pays thÂ« CJIlroy Ad%'ocate. to ac
cept an offer to bond Its land for $300,000.
The Paso Robles Independent is author
ity for the statement that a Seattle capi
talist has arranged to drill on the Nacl
mlento ranch, rear Paso nobles.
The yield of the Fullerton field In Feb
ruary amounted to 53,000 barrels, which
was a gain of 2500 barrels over the Janu
ary output. Within the npxt ninety days
nine companies willput new wells on the
pump, and the oredlctlon Is made locally
that the ofttput will be increased to 65,000
barrels per month.
The Bakersfleld Galifornian learns that
the Standard Oil Company will not go into
the field in Kern County to offer an nr
bitrnry price for oil. It will ask for sealed
proposals from producers and will, of
course, accept the lowest bids.
The claim is made that the Kern River
district has In view a market for 200
carloads of its oily products daily. The
Balw-rsfleld California!! says that thcra
would be no difficulty in disposing of that
amount of oil daily, but it cannot be de
livered on account of the shortase in the
supply of tank cars.
If the excursion to the oil fields of Kern
County from this city next Saturday
proves to he a j,ucccjs l>,ere is a probabil
ity that there v.Mll be several others.
Trains will run from Bakersfleld to the
Kern River fields and to the McKittrick
district for the accommodation of the ex
cursionists.
A story Is told by Southern California
newspapers to show how money has com*Â»,
unsought, to some persons who have hap
pened to own oil land?. The story applies
particularly to Mr. Whlttlger of Santa
Paula. Ho has been engaged for some
years In ranching and divided his time ba
tween the care of a vineyard and an or
ange orchard, lie harrowed his ground
abundantly and kept It looking- well. Only
there was a place that could not work.
That was a black, sliniy pool at the crest
of a hill. He covered it with virgin soil
several times, but the slime would seea
through In spite of nil that he could Ao.
In rainy weather a slimy scum would be
carried down toward his. hpuse. When the
oil boom struck Santa Paula oH mnn,
looking for signs of oil In all directions,
visited the Whlttiger place, saw his slimy
pool and at once declared thfct he had In
the pool an excellent indication of an
abundant supply of petroleum. Many cf
fers to buy the ranch were made after
that, but Whittiger rt- fused to sell, lie
aJso declared that he would not dri'.l for.
oil nor would ho hire any one to drill fov*
him. The orchard 'bu.^iness*- so he said,
was good enough for him. But Whlttlger
finally concluded that he would dig: down
sufficiently to pipe the oil off. He is get
ting several â¢barrels of oil a. day by this
crude arrangement and. It Is understood,
he can get a large price for his land
whenever he will sell 11.
.Some of the papers of this State are
taking up the fake sales that are going
on. Shares have been marketed at prices
that were absurd. One" company that wa3
selling shares at 1 cent each in Los An
geles was selling the same In San t'ran
cisco at nearly 300 per cent advance on
that at the same time. The fact is that
there are companies that need looking
Into. Fortunes have be<:n made in oil in
vestments In California In the last ye-ir
and many more fortunes will unquestion
ably-be made here in the near future. But
every Investor should take ordinary car-*,
at least, to find out what he Is paying nis
money out for, unless he considers that
-he is gambling. In which case no warning
applies. Where there are so many prom â¢
lslns localities there la no necessity for
faking. Such work hurt? the business in
the eyes of moneyed mon and does more
harm to a legitimate Industry than can
be remedied in a long time.

New York Stock Market.
XEW TORK. March Câ The character of to
ds y'e stock market was very similar 'to that
of yesterday. Absorption of railroad stocks
of a high grade by buyers of abundant re
sources and of a substantial kind went on
side by ride with wide fluctuations In some of
the highly speculative specialties. So far as
the railroad department was concerned, ac
tivity was Fhifted to some extent from those
stocks which were most prominent yesterday.
A notable feature of the market was that It
did not really respond v.Ith unanimity at any
time to the strength shown by invldiual Etocks.
Also in those stocks which did advance the
strength ivae not simultaneous. Apparently
the demand for one stock would be largely
satisfied before buying was taken up in an
othfi. During the latter part of the day there
v.as abundant evidence of large prefit-takir.g.
Stocks which had been strong early in the
day fe'l back materially and many usually
prominent stocks which were not notably ac
tive to-day were allowed to fell back below
last night's level. Nevertheless the day's gains
are very urikirg. both by reason cf tho char
acter of the stocks affected and the amount
of transaction* and the extent of the gains
in them Yesterday's late movement in Bur
lington was cortlnuod at the outset this morn
ing, and the stock was carried up 2-V, to 150&
u recor-l price. The rtrcngth of the stock was
due to the fact that large competing railroad
interests are admittedly buying the stock, pro
fessedly for Investment, but according to tne
Wall street Interpretation with a i>ossible view
to consolidation or. at all events, to the exten
flon of a community of Interests. Union Pa
cific. Northern Pacific and Pennsylvania were
all raid to be interested in the buying. The
Baltimore and Ohio stocks continued to show
conspicuous strength, thÂ»Â» common advancing
3 and the preferred 2Â»Â«. There was also a
striking movement in- Atchlscn preferred,
which carried it up 3 points. The common
stocks of this road. Union Pacific, South
ern Pacific and Louisville and Nashville were
also very strong. The later movement of the
I day had some aprÂ»aranc: of manipulation for
the purpose of .sustaining the market while
profit-taking uas in progress elsewhere. The
reactionary movement took a point or moie
from the best price of many of the etocks.
There was a long list of Etocks of smaller
railroads which were moved up all the way
from a point to 2%. Long Island rose S',4 on
light transactions and closed v.-ith a net gain
cf 6*4. Among the industrials. Amalgamated
Copper and Sugar claimed the largest share of
attention. The former opened down 1?* on re
ports of a renewal of antagonistic measures 111
Montana. It was etrongly supported and
rallied 2Â»i at one time, but In the late deal-
Ings It broke below 101 and closed with a net
loss of 2' 4 - Sugar was forced under last night's
pricÂ» for only a brief period, and after varied
nuctuations closed with a net gain of ]%. The
steel stocks continued much neglected and
heavy in tone.
The railroad bond market continues active
and prices generally higher. Total sales, 15,-

Boston Wool Market
BOSTON, March C. â The American Wocl and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
"There is as yet no substantial Improvement
to be noted in the wool market except that
dealers are disposed to exercise a little more
discretion In selling, although there is still
more or less pressure to liquidate and wool has
been sold at lower prices the past week than at
any time since the downward movement began.
A large line of territory which was carried as
collateral has been parted with at a clean cost
of 35Â® 36c, which Is the lowest level touched for
that class of wool. A portion of the same
wools were sold two weeks previously at a clean
cost of 42c. A number of- holders, not pleased
with the amount of stock on hand and a new
clip of 300,000 pounds close In sight, are natur
ally desirous of cleaning out their stocks and
pome consigners who had hitherto been holding
their wools nbove the market price have urged
the commission houses to let them go, in order
to clear the way for the new season's product.
The prices at which wools are being sold are
about low enough to interest investors and It Is
reported that there have been some purchases
for speculative account, not very extended as
yet, but sufficiently pronounced to Indicate that
speculative Interests are carefully watching the
situation and rio willing to take hold when
what they consider a favorable opportunity pre
sents Itself. The sales for the week in Boston
amounted to 3.374,500 pounds domestic and 335.000
pounds foreign, making _a total of 3,729.500.
against a. total of fi.546.000 for the previous week
and a total of l,SS5,C0O for the corresponding
week last year.
The sales since January 1 amount to 34.736.900
pounds, against 33.S01.C00 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year.

WHAT TVALL STR1CET THINKS OF IT
AND WHAT IT MAY LEAD TO.
The new Tork circular cf Henry Clews says:
"The tenrion in \Ya!l street due to the ren
dericy of the rrest consolidation of iron and
eteel corporations has been relieved by the
consummation of the scheme and the formal
publication cf ltÂ« details. The capitalization
cf the corporation amounts to a total of
11.100.000.000. Including *300.(KX>.<>00 In bonds.
INMMlMi in preferred Hock and J400.0O0.000 In
common Ftcck. The botids are to be, for the

partners in Â»-x^hanjrÂ«> IÂ«ir their Interests, while
both the preferred and common stocks will be
Issued in fxchanfe for the stocks of the merj?<~l
cr-mpanie* and also to the extent of about 170,-
CO.onQ for subsidiary purposes. The seven com
ranies consolidated are recent creations and.
a^. a rule, were pen^raliy capitalized on the
1 .isis of the common ot.K-k represÂ»-ntingr mainly
the pood will, etc. It will be observed, there
fore, that the issues <_f the new corporation
Â¦will Ftani in the siitk' relative position. A
strong syndicate of bar.kr and foreign bankers
has underwritten the undertaking to the ex
tent of $2</'.000.oiV\ ; which insuros the success
of thÂ» flotation heyon-1 all peradventure and
may be pxj>ec{ei1 to pmtect the money market
from any possible 4isÂ»url>anoe arising from the
operations. Wall street now understands the
scheme and is mainly concerned with estimat
ing its Intrinsic strenst!: and the future mar
ket value of the n*"sv securities. Excepting the
lÂ«rue of J3rti.t,C"">0.Wi of Â»-on<is the capitalization
cf the new company will make no material ad
dition to the volume of securities on the mar
ket: and the eame will be true of the bon'ls
if Mr. Carnegie and his associates should
choose to ketp them in their possession: which,
however, is subject to d'jubt. Mr. Carnegie's
w^ll known prudence may be expected to lead
him to exchange some considerable proportion
of the morlKape for a variety of other Invest
ment* rather than have too many eggs in one
basket.
"Beyond these immediate aspects of the
great transaction this event suggests to Wall
FtrÂ».-*-t soiue questions cf very great Interest.
It presents an application of the trust prin
ciple upou a scale But-parsing- anything that
has tttHh surr-'wed probable, or even possible.
It is a strtkins Illns-tratlon of the way in
which larpe concentrations of industrial cap
ital tend to the creation of still larger. It is
cnnfifd that the merged companies found
themselves face to face with an Inevitable
end destructive competitionâ a battle between
EiF.m*â and this amalgamation was brought
about by a threat from Mr. Carnegie to poach
cn the rrÂ«*erves of hir neighbors. The or
ganization of this huge concern Is openly Justi
fied by its promoter* on the ground that tt is
lytu-r to Invest thirty or forty millions. In
ordfr to harmonize i^mpeting Interests, than
â¢to Introduce iZA to V*> million* of new capital
for the destruction or existing Industries.' 'All
of *chi<-Â»i amounts to p.n n<~knowle<3cnient that
great concentrations of capital cannot realize
tl-.eir porlcy until tluy hÂ«ve Â»>er>ome vl/-tual
monopolies. I'pon Xh'.f- principle may not the
1'nited Ptatf-s HiÂ«-el Company, having got un
der Its control one-luCf of the iron trade, find
iuvelf compelled to carry on Its programme of
annexation until It monopolizes the entire In
dustry ? And. again, aye there no other In
dustries likf-ly to find thcm*elvrÂ« In the t>am*
l>oÂ£itlon of inevitable competition between
strong capitals and 3r:vr-n to neek fuller pro
tection in still larper amalgamations? If this
policy hats already provÂ«-o to be a necensity In
the Iron trade what Is tÂ« prevent Its applica
tion until we have reached a condition in
â¢which every other in^uMry will be wned or
controlled liy one Inc* unrated monopoly. It
fwmt to me that we are verging toward the
creation of a vast mas* of new securities. In
which It i.- to he hopcl conservatism will pre

CHICAGO. March 6.â "Wheat started with a
good demand from shorts and commission
houses, the market being Influenced by a sharp
advance at Liverpool and still felt the Impetus
which it galnod on the curb yesterday after
the close. This- strength was due to a sudden
fear that the cold weather had done or would
do severe damage to the infant crop, and as
the weather was still frigid to-day, the in
fluence remained as a comfort to the bulls,
although the bearlshly Inclined wpeculators
smiled at it. May opened Vic, to %Â©Vic higher
at 75T4 to 76@76Vfce, and sold to 76Â»ic It re
acted to 76c during the forenoon and held
fcteady lor come time. Lack of outside demanil
latfr caused a further decline on a very dull
market and the olose was easy. May un
changed at 75%c. the bottom price for the day.
Following a brief period of moderate activ
ity at the opening, the corn market ruled dull
and featureless. May closed a shade lower at
<0Â»i@40Ttc. .
Oats were less dull than wheat and corn.
The market opened fcteady. but tired longs
soon let go or considerable quantities. The
close was weak. May %c lower at 25Vic.
Provisions were dull but firm on light hog
receipts. A demand for pork offset moderate
fellire of lard. May pork closed 7%c higher,
lard a shade up and ribs 5c higher.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL
Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris futures were
lower.. New York ! stood about the same.
Zero' weather at Chicago and a cold wave
over a great part of the wheat belt occasioned
some alarm at Chicago, especially as the
plant is not protected by snow, and this, with
rather better cables, gave that market more
tone at the opening, and there were more
buyers than sellers at the advance. Minne
apolis millers were good buyers' of cash W heat,
and there was also buying for Liverpool ac
count. The Improvement. however. was
checked by selling by heavy holders, and there
was also some quiet long selling. The crowd
became bearish, and the close was wea'cer.
The Government report on Saturday will show

George W. Tyler, who claims to have
been employed by the Forepaugh circus,
made a desperate, but unsuccessful at
tempt to terminate his existence yester
day at the Revere House, at 675 Mission
street. When he was found by the pro
prietor he was sitting In the hallway,
bleeding profusely from two ugly wounds
which he had inflicted upon himself. One
of tfie wounds, which was an ugly gash,
dangerously near the jugular vein, ex
tended from his left ear down to the cen
ter of the larynx, while the other was
a ragged cut at the apex of the heart.
The wounds were made with* a razor,
which was subsequently found â¢ upon his
person. The Injured . man was removed
to the Receiving Hospital, where his
wounds were dressed. Tne, doctors who
attended to his case entertain little hope
of preserving his life. He Is a natlv* of
Virginia, 25 years of age according to his
statement. Despondency and lack "of em
ployment were the causes of his act.

CONSUL GENEBAL CONEY
7 CONTRADICTS REPORT
Letter Thp.t Life of Mexican
President Has Not Been in
Danger.
Consul General Coney of Mexico denies
that there is any truth in an article pub
lished in El Paso and telegraphed to this
city to the effect that an attempt had been
made upon the life of President Diaz.
Concerning the report Consul General
Coney writes as follows:
In this morning's issue of The Call there ap
pears an article copied from an El Paso paper
referring 1 to a reported attempt on the life of
General Diaz. Kindly allow me Epace to most
emphatically deny the statements published. I
can assure you that no attempt either by slow
poison or otherwise has been made on 'the life
of the Chief Executive of Mexico. I have re
ceievd a personal communication from him
within the last few days dated at Cuernavaca,
where he had cone on a two weeks' hunting
trip. He had riot taken a vacation of such
length in years. It is not to be believed that a
man of such sagacity and energy who has
guided the Mexican ship of state with a firm
hand for . a quarter of a century would leave
the rudder in a squally time. Therefore the fear
of a revolution in Mexico ia entirely groundless.
Very respectfully. A. K. CONEY,
i Consul General of Mexico.

CONLIN BUDTED BY
BETTING ON RACES
Embezzling New York Postal Clerk
Attributes His Downfall to the
Bookmakers.
Joseph A. Conlin, the embezzling postal
clerk who was arrested last Tuesday
night by Postal Inspectors C. C. James
and J. E. Jacobs of New York City, was
delivered into the custody of United State3
Marshal Shine yesterday. Inspector
Jacobs, for the purposes of the extra
dition, swore to auomplalnt against Con
lin, charging him with embezzlement.
The prisoner will be taken this morning
before United States Court Commissioner
Heacock to have a time set for the ex
amination. He will not resist the extra
dition proceedings, ab he has made a full
confession to the inspectors who arrested
him. He told them also that he received
only $300 of the 137.000 taken from the
plundered registered pouch, the remainder
having been taken by his partner, whose
identity he refused to disclose.
Conlin said his crime was prompted by
a desire to retrieve his losses In betting
on the races. He escaped from New York
with a young woman named Sarah Don
nelley, leaving his v/Jfe and two children
for the woman whose acquaintance he
made at the racetrack. His wife has sued
him for a divorce. The New York in
spectors were aided materially in tracing
the fugitive by Chi?f Munro and Inspector
Erwin of this city.

Great excitement . was evident around
the railroad building yesterday over the
announcement that E. H. FItzhugh of the
Central Vermont road was on his way to
the coast to accept a position at the hands
of President Hays with the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Fitzhugh is a railroad man of ability
and, like Hays, has risen from the ranks.
He is also a high priced man, and deep
conjectures are being made as to whose
position he is to take. The choice seems
to lie between Fillmore and Kruttschnitt,
and from present indications it looks a.s
if the latter will be the man to go.
Kruttschnltt is an Importation from the
East, a Huntington protege, and was
placed in a high position in the. Southern
Pacific by Huntington regardless of all
rules of promotion. The "knockers" are
busy saying that Kruttschnitt should lose
his position as general manager for a
number of reasons. . They claim, that
Kruttschnitt is a wonder to dally with
paper and pencil and that he is a statisti
cian with few equals, but when he is
called upon, to deliver the goods he is sad
ly lacking. Kruttschnitt at one time made
out a stupendous report that showed that
the Southern Pacific ran over less men
than any road in the Union, but he failed
to consider, so railroad men say, the most
important point, and that is that Califor
nia is . not densely populated, and that
consequently tho road ran less risk than
do the roads in Eastern States.
Hays, so it is claimed, has no use for
the Collls Huntingdon proteges, .and upon
his return to San Francisco a number of
changes are anticipated. . Killmore is gen
erally-conceded to be secure in his posi
tion on account of his practical knowl
edge.
R. P. Schwerin is also scheduled to go.
He is at present in charge of the purchase
of supplies for the Southern Pacific. He
was appointed to the position he now
holds owing to his social connections with
the late Collis P. Huntington. Who will
take this fat position with its J9000 a year
is a conjecture, but there are a number of
men who have prown gray in the service
who are capable of filling it, among them
being J. W. Dayan, Dick Stevens and Alex
Center. 'Â¦:: '*: ' .-\. : J

that his trip out here was simply a busi

DIES IN SWITZERLAND
Dr. Bazan, Former Proprietor cf Sut

While Traveling.
Wrr<1 was received in this city yester
iay of the death in Switzerland of. Dr.
; '( rnand Bazan, a prominent physician.
" uho practiced for years in this city. His
leaxh occurred In GMcn sur Montreaux
March Â«.
Dr. Bazan became crominent here sev
eral years ago as the proprietor of the
Sutter-Ftreet Hammam baths. He was a
:>;itive o* Cuua ani !s survived by his
wite -
s-hort stories. His name was familiar to
the readers of Sunday supplements and
magazines.
Mr. Carrington first attracted attention
while editor of the Penny Press, a small
but excellent newspaper, which he con
ducted in Santa Cruz. When he sold out
his interest In that journal he came to this
city and contributed stories and articles
to The Call. He was subsequently made
Sjnday editor and he produced a supple
ment of literary merit. He resigned to
accept a similar position on another pa
per. His short stories published by the
Black Cat Publishing Company were
widely read and greatly enjoyed. lie pos
sessed a vivid imagination and he de
veloped a plot with groat ability. Time
and again he was awarded first prize for
his stories. lie recently completed a
novel, which was accepted by a leading
Eastern* publishing house.
The funeral will bo. held from Mr. Car
rinpton's late residence this afternoon at
4 o'clock. Â¦' .
The police have a mvstery to deal with
and are vainly trying to solve it. Last
Monday morning when the family of
Thomas Greenan-. the well-known tailor,
who lives at 27 Sanchez street, repaired
to the dining-room lor beakfast they
were surprised to see a coat and vest and
an old hat which did not belonc to tho
male members of the family lying care
lessly on a table. In one. of the pockets
of the vest was a gold watch>
Unable to solve the mystery of the pres
ence of the clothing ain.hat,' which might
have belonged to a burglar or an intoxi
cated individual who had got into the
wrong house. Mr. Grecr.an at once com
menced an "investigation," with the re
sult that he discovered a pair of well
worn shoes which, had evidently been
thrown away by the owner. They were on
the rear porch. The rear door was open,
but there was nothing to" show that it
had been forced. Footprints in the ad
joining yard convinced Greenan that the
stranger who had left part of his attire,
together with his gold timepiece, in his
house had climbed ov_r a high fence in
the rear of his home .ind then trained an
entrance. - â¢
Why the stranger should remove his
outer garments, providing, he was a burg
lar, is. indeed, mystifying, particularly to
Captain Seymour's sleuths. The head of
the Detective Department is determined
to solve the mystery and to-day he will
send his men to interview all the clothiers
in the city with a view of having the coat
and vest Identified. If successful he is
reasonably, certain of solving the mystery
of the "find."

EECRUITS FROM BOWERY
UNDER STRONG GUARD
Leaders in Disturbances Will Be
Court-Martialed and Severely
Punished.
The recruits whose mutinous conduct en
route from Fort Slocum, New York, to
this city caused the officers commanding
them all sorts of trouble, are encamped
at the Presidio and the tents devoted to
their use" are surrounded by an armed
guard. They are greatly subdued since
their arrival here and present little evi
dence of the numerous battles with con
stables, deputy sheriffs and Uncle Sam's
regulars.
Six of the most turbulent spirits have
betn arrested and placed in the guard
house and it is expected that the confine
ment of these men will cause the others to
restrain their propensities for rioting.
Major R. T. "Yeatman, .when asked for
particulars of the trip yesterday, was very
much averse to giving any, but admitted
fretly that it was a rough one. He said
there was little trouble with the men un
til the train was delayed at Ennls, Tex.,
vhere they secured a quantity of liquor
and a number of them became intoxicat
ed. Previous to the arrival at the Texas
town there had been- several rows, but
they were quelled without much difficulty.
There, however, the men got beyond con
trol, the tiresome wait affording them op
portunity to get drunk.
Every effort was made to keep the men
in the cars, but the force in charge was
too small and they did about as they
pleased until a strong guard was received
at San Antonio. The men were then sub
dued, but not until several of them had
received rough handling. The reinforce
ments from Fort Houston were in com
mand of Lieutenant L. P. Shindel. The
men who were injured in the tights are all
being treated at the general hospital and
in a few days will be rea-dy to appear be
fore a board for trial on a charge ot
drunkenness and disobedience of orders.
Troop C. Fifth Cavalry, under command
of Captain McClure. arrived at the Pre
sidio yesterday mornlner. The troop has
been on duty at Fort Wtngate, New Mex

SAN JOSE. March 6.â For the fonrth
time a jury has heard the evidence against
ex-Constable Frederick Begerow of Al
viso, who shot and killed Joseph Cech
and August Berger at the brewers' picnic
here on July 15 las*, without returning a
verdict. The last jury came Into Judge
Lorigan's court this evening, after hav
ing been locked up for thirty hours, and
reported that it coul/i not agree on a ver
dict. The Jurors were discharged. They
stood seven for manslaughter to five for
acquittal.
Constable Begerow had attended the
brewers' picnic and while there arrested
George Schmidt, who had created a dis
turbance. As he started to leave the
grounds Cech and Berger took the pris
oner away and beat Uegerow. He warned
them to desist, but they kept attacking
him. Begerow then drew his revolver
and after firing on? shot in the air killed
both men.
The first trial was Interrupted by the
flight of Juror B. Benjamin for Australia
just as the case was ready to go to the
jury. There were six for acquittal and
six for manslaughter at the second trial,
and on the third the Jury stood eight to
four for acquittal. The first three trials
were for the munlc;- of Cech and tho
fourth was for the killing of Berger.
It is believed Begerow will not ba tried
syrain and that the charges will be dis
missed. The- four trials have coat tha
county SOX). Th* Brewers" Union, of
which Cech and Berger were members,
hired special attorneys to aid the Dis
trict Attorney in ti.e prosecution.

Cattlemen Discuss Methods
for thÂ§ Protection of

DENVER, March 6.-The question of
the leasing of the arid lands of the open
range to stock growers has come, to the
front among the subjects to be considered
at the convention of cattle growers now
being held in this city, although it was
rfot mentioned in the call for the conven
tion. . :
Colonel John P. Irish of California in
troduced resolutions advising leasehold
control and Government protection of the
public range.
The committoe on credentials presented
two reports, the majority In favor of rec
ognizing proxies held by delegates and
the minority opposed to so doing. G. F.
Patrick of Pueuio. ex-Senator Carey of
"Wyoming and lormer Congressman Kerr
of Nebraska, now of Mcntrose, Coio.,

Miller of the flrm of Milier & Lux. the
millionaire cattle and sheep men of Cali
fornia, and I. P. Miller, a banker of Wyo
ming, who bandies both cattie and sheep.
After the adoption of tne constitution and
by-lavrs. over which th'-re is to be a lively
light, the leasirs question will come up.
and If the convention ia successful ;n get
ting through with that proposition with
out a split it may be considered as, firmly
organized, but the feelii.Jf is very strong
and it is a question yet whether there will
be an organization or not.
At the night t-ession the only work done
was the selection of a new executive com
mittee. A committeeman and an alternate
from each State represonted were chosen,
as follows, the first name in eacn case

After the convention adjourned until to
morrow the old executive committee met
to finish its business. The Irish resolu
tions, in favor of leasing the public lands,
were discussed and the committee decided
to report them favorably to the conven
tion to-mcrrow. F. C. Goudy of Denver
was the only member vrho voted against
the resolutions. He offered resolutions
against leaslnir. but these were promptly
voted down. The convention will hold Its
closinp session to-morrow, after which the
executive committee will hold its first
meeting.

Epecial Dispatch to The Call,
PORTLAND. March 6.-Charles N.
Scott, treasurer of Trinity ' Episcopal
parish, was arrested to-night for em
bezzling $1500 of church funds, of which
he was custodian. The complaint was or
dered made by a surety company, which
supplied his bond. Trinity is the most
prominent and fashionable church in
Portland and embraces in its membership
most of the local four hundred. It is now
preparing to celebrate its semi-centennial
a few weeks hence. The arrest created no
small sensation.
Mr. Scott, the defaulting treasurer, has
lived here more than twenty years and
until to-nfgrht had an unblemished reputa
tion. He was auditor of the Oreeonian
Railway Company (now a part of the
Southern Pacific's system in Oregon) for
several years and afterward receiver of
the company. Later he went into the real
estate business and is now larpoly inter
ested in irrigation enterprises in South
eastern Oregon." *
He has always moved in the best social
circles and was particularly active in the
Sunday School Â¦work connected with the
Episcopal church and was elected presi
dent of the County Sunday School Con
vention last year.
The discovery of Irregularities In his ac
counts was made by the vestry about a
month ago. Investigation showed that he
had not only withdrawn all the funds on
deposit in the Security Bank, but as treas
urer of the parish hsu overdrawn the ac
count. He promised to make restitution
and the vestry extended him the oppor
tunity, but the surety company Insisted
on criminal proceedings and this after
noon James LaJdlav., British Consul, one
of the vestry, swor-i to the complaint.
Scott was taken to police headquarters
and locked up for the night. He declined
to make a statement or to see a reporter.
A member of the' vestry said that Scott,
when the defalcation was discovered, de
clared he did not know what he had done
with the money. To this statement he
persistently clung and a charitable view
is that he is insane. He is about 55, is
married and has grown children.

Can Learn Her
Identity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 6.â The hull of a
wrecked vessel was seen on November 20
in an immense icefloe near Sledge Island,
Alaska. The discovery was .made by peo
ple living: on the beach near the mouth,
of Penny River, and In the distance the
object appeared to be a large sailing ves
sel. That she had passed through thrill
ing and disastrous experiences was made
evident by her condition above deck. Her
spars were broken off and her rigging hsul
been swept away.
People gathered and eagerly waited for
the wreck to come ashore. At daybreak
it was moving toward the main land and
It was believed that the mystery of lifo
and death would soon be explained. At
noon, however, the wind shifted and tho
big hull was carried out to sea by the Ice.
All efforts to figure out the identity of the
strange craft failed. T. R. Jones, who
brought the news to Nome, said:
"The color of th - e hull appeared to be
black and the only spar remaining was
the bowsprit. About ten days ago a quan
tity of merchandise was washed ashore
near the mouth of Penny River. There*
were crates of etegs and other kinds of
supplies. It may be that these goods came
from one of the lighters which lost pood*
while unloading last fall, but thÂ© appear
ance of the ship raised a doubt on this
point."

SAN JOSE, March 6.â A number of the
Porto. Ricans who were induced by the
Examiner to violate their contract and re
main in California while on their way to
the Hawaiian Islands are about to become
county charges. These people -were led to
believe they would practically become
slaves, and they refused to ship from San
Francisco to the Islands. Agents of the
Examiner were asked to find homes for
some of them .n this county, and several
persons took the Porto Rlcans upon the
representation that they would make
good orchard laborers.
Ex-Supervisor John S. Selby was in
duced to take an entire family to work on
his orchard and berry farm. A man and
wife and two children were sent to him.
These have been Indolent, lazy and use
less and have been a. failure as farm la
borers in Santa Clara County. The man
is suffering from eczema. Selby has tired
of supporting them and has made applica
tion to the Board of Supervisors for the
relief of the family. He wants a place
provided for them and provisions for their
support.
This the Supervisors have refused, on
the ground that, they were not residents
of this county and were brought here to
work on a ranch with the understanding
that they would be taken care of.

James Hill Said to Be Seek
ing Control of the Bur- .
lington.
NEW YORK, March 6.â The Commer
cial Advertiser says: The heavy buying
of Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Rail
road shares within the paat few days is
partly explained to-day by the report
from a trustworthy source that James J.
Hill and his friends have been seeking to
obtain control of this property in the in
terest of the Great Northern and North
ern Pacific. Wall street operators say
that both the Union Pacific and the
Northern Pacific interests have secured
sufficient stock to be entitled to represen
tation in the board of control.
The efforts of outside parties to secure
control of the Chicago, Burlington^ and
Quincy have been stoutly resisted by some
of the largest stockholders, who have been
connected with the property for many
years and who have a strong faith in its
future growth. These inside Interests
have thus far prevented the newcomers
from securing a majority of the Burling
ton stock. Whether their resistance to a
change in the control will continue to be
effective remains to be seen.
It is an Interesting fact that one of the
strongest interests in Burlington, which is
seeking to preserve the independence of
that prpperty, is the same interest that
was largely instrumental in preventing J.
P. Morsran and James J. Hill from get
ting control of the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad.
The report that the Pennsylvania Rail
road interests were buying Burlington
shares Is authoritatively denied by repre
sentatives of ihat company. The Penn
sylvania, people say that they have now
all the railroad property they want.
SALT LAKE, March 6.â The Tribune to
morrow morning will s.ay: It can be au
thoritatively announced that the Harri
man (syndicate has not bought the R:o
Grande Western nor is there the slightest
probability of such a purchase. On the
other hand it cannot be denied that a bis
Rio Grande Western deal ia on the tapis,
and although it may be well Into the sum
mer before it is fully consummated yet
the examination just made by the experts
Is for the purpose of effecting such a plan.
The Rip Grande Western, it can be added,
will remain a most decided factor in Utah
railroad circles and in the transcontinen
tal situation. '
NEW YORK, March 6.â The Mail and
Express to-day cays: Some large West
ern shippers of freight complain that it Is
now useless to make the rounds of the
various railroad offices looking for con
cessions on shipments from Chicago to
Pacific Coast points, for example.
RAILROAD MEN
IN A NEW DEAL
, This is pointed to as one of the Imme
diate results of the bankers' agreements
for the division of all the railroads of the
United States into groups, or community
of ownership. It means that the advisory
board of a half-dozen men now hold the
reins, and whenever rates need adjusting
the qrtlers emanate from this body of
bankers who appointed the committee.
There are no longer any long wrangles
of traffic officials. These men are instruct
ed, to get together and make such tariffs
of such changes in the rates as the bank
ers' committee, or perhaps the presidents
themselves, think ought to be made. A3
a result the machinery works as smoothly
as if there were only one great system
Instead of many independent ones.
Some railroad authorities think the in
creased revenue, by reason of the abolish
ment of rate cutting and because of a few
small advances in tariffs, will amount to
550,000,000 or more a year. According to
one authority the losses to the railroads
annually for the payment of commissions
used to run into the millions, and as a
rule" the general public did not benefit cor
respondingly. Again, the- community of
ownership method has reduced rivalry to
a minimum, and It has been possible to
run fewer trains and make less extrava
gant concessions, In order to secure busi
ness.

SAX JOSE. March Â«.â The $10,000 libel
F.ult of Sheriff Mansfield of San Mateo
County apainst D. K. O'Keefe. editor of
the Redwood City Times-Gazette, will be
called for trial before Judge Lorigan to
morrow morning. Thf action grows out
of an article published by OKeefe. in
Â¦which he accused Sheriff Mansfield and
Judpe Buck of the Superior Court of
that county of aiding In clearing Con
stable Frank Desirello of the charge of
killir.p James Johnson, a boy, at Culoma
in 1K<Â«.
Johnson and two other boys were going
past In a v.-agon, bound for a trip to the
country, when the constable hailed them.
and 1411011 they refused to stop I>esirello
t-hot and killed Johnson. ! Two trials re
sulted in disagreements.
O'Keofe charged that Hesirello was a
"lickspittle" for Mansfield and Buck:
that the^e officers pave no assistance in
prosecuting the charge against him and
nided him to escape punishment. Sheriff
Mansfield alleges these statements have
.lamaged him to the extent of <19,000.

voyant, can be consulted dally on all affairs of
life; he advises you whether you will be suc-
cessful In business, mining or. lawsuits, etc.;
Professor .Totnis Is beyond the shadow- of a
doubt the most scientific practicing palmist
and clairvoyant In the world to-day.
There Is no licmÂ«Â» Â»o dreary or sad, no life
fo hard and blighted, no heart so sad nnd
lonely, that cannot be set right and kept right
after a visit to this Inspired prophet or mc3Â«rn
times; all longstanding and chronic diseases
that have baffled the physician's skill curÂ»d
without the use of medicine; he reunites the
separated. settles lovers* quarrel:. causes
epcedy and happy marriage, locates hidden
treasures, removes evil Influences; cures fits:
drunkenness cured without the patient's
knowledge; tells If your loved one Is true; en-
ables you to win the affection of any one you
dÂ»sire; also that which n person is best adapt-
ed for In life Is pointed- out; he enables you to
overcome your enemies; no matter what your
trouble ir. he ran and will help you or
charge you nothing for his services.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Sacramento, Fresno and Los Angeles
have afteady formed organizations for the
purpose of attracting colonists and It was
decided that this city should have some
tring of this sort. Various suggestions
were offered, none of which seemed to
meet with favor, but finally It was decided
that the chair be given forty-eight -hours
in which to select a committee of five to
act on the proposition. The meeting was
then adjourned till the expiration of tho
allotted time. . . -'" : - , Â¦
Mr. Bunker was chosen chairman of the
meeting and suggestions were requested.
Henry Jacobs, one of the largest fruit
canners of the State, stated that 51.000,000
worth of fruit was rotting on the ground
because there was no labor to be had andÂ»
on this line alone, if visitors could be pur
suaded to remain in this State, it would
be of immense advantage to commercial
interests.
j. p. Whitney, who owns more than o0,
000 acres of valuable fruit land In South
ern California, said that the keynote of
the situation was first to get proper rail
road facilities and then to Induce home
seekers to come here.
K. P. Chipman, president of the State
Board of Trade, said that one of the
greatest services which such a. bureau
could perform was to show how land in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys
could be purchased at a cheaper rate than
similar land in the Missouri and Missis
sippi valleys.
Mayor Phelan spoke briefly in regard to
discharged soldiers, statin? that they
were desirable colonists, who would re
main in this section if they could be
shown its advantages.
Representatives of . fruit growers, the
State Board of Trade and of other im
portant commercial bodies of this city and
State met yesterday afternoon In the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce for
the purpose of taking action in regard
to the establishment of an Information
bureau in San Francisco for the benefit
of the thousands of tourists and colonists
â¢who are â¢ expected here within a few
months and of the volunteer soldiers who
will be mustered out here between now
and June. -

Although the presence of oil In large
quantities in California has been known
for a generation, and its development has
been prosecuted In scattered localities for
years, It has never until now assumed the
pioportions of a great and dominant In
dustry. -There Is every indication that
for the next few years ana may be per
manently it will rank with or exceed min
ing as a wealth producer. As a factor
In manufacture In will probably take first
rank, because it bears such close and
Important relations to the fuel problem.
The time to profit by investment in a
new industry is in the first rush of the
tide. Now It is possible to get a secure
footing with a comparatively small capi
tal. -. It is also possible to go into the
field and make personal investigation at
email cost. The Southern Pacific will give
an excursion into the Kern River oil
region at Bakersfleld on Saturday next,
leaving- _ San Francisco at - 7 p. ; m., and
returning early Monday' morning. The
entire day, Sunday, â¢ will be devoted to
side trips to OH City. McKittrick and
elsewhere at slight additional cost. Ten

Â¦U'iniam Price, whe was restored to thp
rsr.k of lieutenant of police by the Police
Commissioners Tuesday night, reported
for duty to Chief Sullivan yesterday
rr.crr.ing. The Chief assigned him to the
Mission district to act in conjunction with
I-ieureriaat Anderson during the absence
through sickness of Captain Gillen. Price
was the recipient Â»i many hearty con
gratulations from his friends yes'terday
for -having his rights' accorded him and
his reputation a* an honest and efficient

It is now In order for Bernard Harter.
Harry Hook. James Kelly and Michael
Murphy to apply for reinstatement as ser
geants. s.s they w^re disrated like Price
without knowing Â¦what charge was
brought against th.tn or having the op
portunity cf facing their accusers. It is
probable that the men who were dis
charged about six years ago in the same
mariner will also appiy for reinstatement.

The Pattosien Company Has Some
thing' to Say.
Many times Mr. Pattoslen warned the
public not to buy furniture and carpets
fÂ»n the Installment plan. Read the reports
of all yesterday's dailies in regard to
what has happened to a well-known lady
of this city In buying a piano on the In
stallment plan. She paid $210 on the piano
â a balance due of Jltw. The party fell be
hind paying for two months and asked to
be given another month, which the house
promised to do. but before the month was
up the collector came from the piano
house for the instrument. The lady
pleaded with the roan not to take thn
piano.- saying hex husband made arrange
ments to pay the balance on the first of
the month. It was no use; he forced his
way into the room and called some men.
The poor -woman tried to keep the piano-
She was kicked out of the house and al
most killed. When lying helpless on the
sidewalk the men took the piano and
carried it back to the installment house.
This should be a good lesson to the pub
lic. No. the Pattosien Company don't do
any Installment business. We want to do
an honest business: we have always done
it and -we will continue to do so. The

The meeting closed with three hearty
cheers for the . Federation of Labor. The
men then formed and marched to their
hall on East street.
The next speaker was Jefferson B.
Pierce of the American Federation of La
bor, who In vigorous language denounced
the policy of employing Chinese on ves
sels, "thereby jeopardizing lives, solely
that dividends may be declared." He was
followed by Edward Rosenberg, secre
tary of the San Francisco* Labor Coan
cil. who reviewed the present history of
the labor organizations In this city, and
described the efforts of the various
unions to secure their rights.
Macarthur was followed by H. W. Hut
ton, Â¦who told of the efforts made In be
half of the sailors in the courts and Leg
islatures of the country. He spoke of the
time when the man who followed the sea
for a living was looked up to. and said
the efforts of the members of the union
should be devoted to procuring such re-
Vision of the statutes as would place the
seafaring man In other than the position
of serfdom which had been his position
for some years past.
The sixteenth anniversary of the organ
ization of the Sailors' Union of the Pa
cific was celebrated last night at Metro
politan Temple, and fully 500 members,
dressed in their neat marching uniform,
turned out to do honor to the event. The
celebration commenced with a parade
along the principal streets, and many
heajrty words of praise were heard, as the
lusty sailors, attired In black trousers and
white sailor blouses, with broad blue col
lars and the natty sailor caps, passed
along the street3 - on - the way to Uie
Temple.
The galleries of the Fifth-street hall
and the seats not reserved for the mem
bers of the union were filled with spec
tators, who heartily cheered the seamen
as they entered the hall.
The celebration was opened by W. Mac
arthur, who in a neat speech reviewed
in a general way the history of the union
since its organization on March 8. 1SS5.
On that date a mere handful of the men
who "go down to the sea In ships'" gath
ered on Folsom-street wharf and laid the
foundation of the organization, which has
since grown to mammoth proportions and
has accomplished a great deal for the
betterment of the condition of the tollers
of the sea, Mr. Macarthur spoke of the
presence of the Chinese crews on ves
sels owned and operated by steamship
companies, and said the Sailors" Union,
would demand legislation that would pro-
Vide that every vessel flying the American
flag must have a full complement of
American seamen, who, in the event of
a disaster such as took place in our own
harbor but a> few days ago. would not
consider the safety of their own lives
before that of the passengers Intrusted
to their care.

COAST SEAMEN
ARE PROSPEROUS
The investigation Into the loss of the
Eteamship by Inspectors Bolles and Bul
ger was to have been resumed yesterday
afternoon, but owing to the failure of the
Pacific Mail Company to produce some of
the passengers who survived the disaster
as witnesses, the investigation was ad
journed until to-day at 1 p. m.
The heavy wind of yesterday prevented
the use of "the drag rope by the divers,
who hoped to again locate the resting
place of the wreck and make fast to it.
With favorable conditions another at
tempt will be made to fasten the drag
rope on the hull of the submerged ship.
Major T. J. Blakeney yesterday resumed
his investigation into the failure of the
life-savers to respond to the signals of
distress sent out by the Rio de Janeiro
as she was sinking. The result of the
day's work was similar to that of the pre
ceding days and was to the effect that
the distress whistles of the Rio were
heard by soldiers and others who were
stationed at a greater distance from the
Rio than were the officers, and men of the
life-saving stations and that the civilians
and soldiers who heard the signals recog
nized them as those given by a vessel In
distress for the purpose of summoning
assistance. .
F A. Harrington, keeper of the light
house above Fort Point, testified that he
htard the Rio sounding her fog signals be
fore she struck and the danger signal
after she had gone upon the reef. The
last whistle was a long blast lasting four
or five minutes.
William Brander, a passenger on the
Rio, swore that the distress whistles con
tinued without cessation for three or four
minutes and until the vessel sank beneath
the waves. This testimony was cor
roborated by that of Quartermaster Lind-
Private F. W. George of Battery A,
Third Artillery, testified that he was on
puard about three-quarters of a. mile from
Fort Point and that at the time of the
wreck* he heard four short blasts of the
whistle, followed by one long continuous

Censure for the Pacific Mall Company,

In air circles. The efforts made by The
Call to locate the wreck had no effect in
stirring the Pacific Mail Company to ac
tion.
ps-ri-sa HOUSANDS of persons in the city
. I yesterday read with Interest the ac
1 count of the work carried out on
JJL Tuesday by The Call and Its corps
of Japanese divers to locate the
resting place of the steamship Rio de
Janeiro and the scores of bodies which
are thought to be penned down in the hull
cf the sunken vessel. The probability
that the divers had found the location of
the ship by sweeping the Golden Gate
with a* gigantic drag rope created con
siderable comment and it was the fer
vently expressed hope on all sides that
the relatives of those who lost their lives
in the disaster of February 22 might soon
have the small consolation of at least
knowing where the remains of their loved
ones rest.
The remains which were found Monday
floating In the waters of the bay at El
Campo. and which were supposed to be
those of one of the unfortunate victims
cf the Rio de Janeiro tragedy, was iden
tified yesterday at San Rafael as those of
G. B. Lucetti. a fisherman of San Fran
cisco, who had been missing for over a.
month. The Identification was made by a
friend of the deceased through the me
dium of the description published in the
newspapers. As no marks of violence ap
peared on the corpse it is surmised that
death resulted accidentally. The body was
brought to this city for interment yester
day afternoon.

NOT A BIO VICTIM.
Remains at El Campo Are Thoss of
From testimony given at the varlou3 In
vestigations that have followed the wreok
of the Rio it is imo'jsslble to theorize
upon - whose death occurred first: This
gives Mr. Wildman's brother a certain ad
vantage in the litigation yet to come, for
it has often been held "that when the
question of survivorship is raised, when
both decedents were occupying similar po
sitions in the fisrht for life, it shall bo
considered that the stronger of the dece
dents was the survivor. a:id when both
are In good health it shall be c nsidered
that the man was the strorger and hence
the survivor."
The question raised in the present cass
is, however, one upon which the court
must pass unless the heirs cf the dece
dents decide to agre? that both died to
gether and that their heirs are entitled to
an equal division of their estates.
In the event it is proveu that Mrs. "W1M
man died first with her children her hus
band would be her heir, wr.ile If she sur
vived Mr. Wildman though but for a few
seconds she would bs entitled to her com
munity Interest in her husband's estate.
In the event it is Droved that Mrs. Wild
man and her children died first Edwin
Wildman, as his brother's heir, would In
herit the property of bcth. but If other
wise Mrs. Wildman's heirs will come Into
possession of a large portion of bota'de
cedents" estates.
Is In the city enraged Â«n two efforts. The
first Is to locate the bodies of hl3 brother,
his wife and their children: the second is
to establish if possible who met death
first, Mr. or Mrs, Wildman. This hair
splitting question will-be decided in thÂ«
Probate Court when the applications of
Mrs. Louis Aldrich, mother of Mrs. "Wild
man, for letters of adminÂ«stration upon
her daughter's estate and that of Edwin
Wildman for letters upon his brother's
estate are called for hearing.

One of these Is Tamada, who has
studied in one of the -Toklo schools for
the past eight years and whose journey
on the lll-fateÂ«l Rio de Janeiro was under
taken in order that he might study the
art of painting as known in the Occident,
In one of the large art centers of the
West. To this end he had obtained a
modest competency, which, with a num
ber of specimens of his work and the rest
of his belongings, was all lost on the Rio.
As may readily be seen by the ambitious
picture (2 feet 6 Inches by 4 feet 4 inches)
the young man's instruction so far has
been obtained from Japanese sources, and
those interested in such matters can eas
ily trace the influences that have affected
him. The picture Is In oils, showing the
vessel half-sunken In the midst of terrific
waves, that bear vivid evidence of the
condition of the painter's mind at the
crucial moment of the wreck. Point Di
ablo is seen in the distance, and the early
dawnllghtâ also evidence of the artist's
imagination â lies over all.
Survivor of the Rio Disaster.
A strange souvenir of the wreck of the
Rio de Janeiro will shortly be placed on
exhibition in one of the art stores of the
city in the shape of a picture painted by
cue of the survivors of the doomed ves
sel in the act of sinking. The picture has
several kinds of interest. Palmed by a
Japanese hoy, Z. Yamada, a former art
student for eight years in Tokio. it is an
example extraordinary of "American art"
as it is understood in Japan. Yamada ex
plains that "American or European art"
is a. fad Just now in the perspectiveless
land of Hiroshige and Toyokuni. and to
supply this new demand the art schools
are turning out students who will shortly
provide the native art patron with pic
tures In- every way equal to those "madÂ»
in. America."

whistles, the latter being about five min
utes' duration. He ran along the bluffs
Â¦toward the life-saving tower and called
twice to Mark Ellingson, who was sup
posed to be on watch there, but could not
succeed in setting a reply.
The sound of the whistles of distress
were also heard bv S. O. Brydges of Bat

Major Blakeney caused some of the wit

great comfort out of that fact.

I The following resolutions, forming a

I mar schools fcr the term ending June 7,
! 1S01, were adopted:
Plan of Promotion.
; Superintendent Webster and Deputy
Â¦ Kir.gsbury were present during the dis
! cussion. but neither had one word to say.
! They both agreed that Mark's attitude is
Â¦ a complete vindication of Kingsbury.
I Then. too. thej- are happy in the thought
I that the bill Increasing deputies' salaries
; passed the Senate by a vote of 26 to 4.
: and there is every indication that it will
â¢*^e passed by the Assembly.
: A further proof that all is not barmo
| riious in the board was presented when
1 an attempt was made to elect a pricipal
I to the O">oper Primary School to succeed
, Mrs. C. R. Pechin. who Â¦was transferred
I try the principaiship of the Longfellow
) School, vice Miss Jennie Smith, deceased,
i Casserly and Mark voted for Miss Nora
I Sullivan of the Marshall School, while
Der.man and Kincaid supported Miss Jes
j sie Smith of the Denman School. The
deadlock failed to be broken after three
ballots had been taken, and the matter
i was deferred until the next meeting.
Resolutions of sympathy were extended
j. to the members of the family of Miss
j Jennie Smith, principal of the Longfellow
â¢ School, who died recently. The resolu
! tions recite that in her death the depart
; mer.t has lost one of its most efficient.
i conscientious and valued principals, and
Â¦ the cause of education one who has given
I her entire life tÂ» Its Interests.
President Kincaid surrendered the chair
temporarilv to Denman and said that she
had talked the matter over very carefullj
with Mr. Mark, and she. too. was con
vinced that the resolution should stand.
Casserly expressed himself similarlj*.
and the resolution was adopted, with
Mark alone voting against it.
President Kincaid Takes Floor.
"I am opposed to any chance, in *hÂ«
record." said Denman, "notwithstanding
Mr. Mark's denial. I am quite sure that
we did not misunderstand Mr. Mark when
he ir.fonsed us that Kingsbury had made
his proposition."
"It Is a harsh Interpretation of the con
versation had between Kingsburj' and
myself regarding: school legislation to say
that he had offered a bribe. In making
rny statement to this board I may have
misunderstood the intent and purpose of
Mr. Kir.gsbury in the discussion."
That dissension is brewing am*n? the
members of Phelan's Board of Education
was made manifest at yesterday's meet
ing, when Directors KIncald, Denman and
Casserly declined to accede to Mark's re
quest that a portion of a resolution,
wherein Deputy Superintendent of
Schools Klngsbury Is charged with hav
ing proposed to withdraw from the Leg
islature bills objectionable to the board
if It would support the one increasing the
salaries of deputy school superintendents
from S1S00 to 13000 per year, be stricken
out. The resolution was adopted at the
last meeting of the board, and when the
mlr.utes were being read Mark rose and
objected to the passage of the section of
the resolution accusing Kingsburj' of
having offered a bribe. He said:
Deadlock in Election of Principal
to Cooper School â New Rules
Adopted for Promotion
of Pupils.
Mark's Vindication of Dep
uty Kingsburj Is Not
Accepted.
