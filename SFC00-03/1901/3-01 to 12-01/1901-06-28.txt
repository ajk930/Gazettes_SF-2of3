THE ladies and gentlemen of the Alabama Press Association were tfcÂ«s
guests of The Call yesterday on a trip around" the bay on board the tug
Defiance. Every minute of the time from 9:30 a. m. to 1:30 p. m. was en-
Joyed by the agreeable and accomplished visitors"frbm"Alabama. Captain
Joseph F. Trewren. commander of the tug," took'excelleht'care of his pas-
Fengers, and not the slightest mishap occurred to Interfere with the day's
enjoyment. The atmosphere was slightly hazy, but the temperature was delightful
and all nthc-r conditions were favorable for an* outing 'on the "water. Â¦ The -tug
steamed slowly away from Pacific-street wharf, pausing a proper distance from
the pier to give the photographers a good range for taking views of the decorated
'.raft. The course from the start was ocean-ward. ' Interesting places on the shore.
Black Point and Presidio reservations, Fort Point. Lime Point ! and . the Cliff
Hovse, were pointed out to the excursionists. Captain Trewren. mindful of the
ladies and appreciating: the store of tempting refreshments, solid and liquid.
which the caterers had placed aboard in the early morning, did not plunge
ahead or venture too far west of Fort Point. The splashes of spray and the roil
grave the Alabamans a slight acquaintance with the Pacific Ocean. The tug re
turning steamed close to the Marin shore. The orchestra aboard discoursed ' en
chanting music, while the scenic views of Sausalito and Belvedere refreshed the
eyer. of the guests. . - .
After passing through Raccoon Straits the tug paused in the smooth water un
der the lee of Angel Island. There the vessel came to a Â¦ slow down and rest to
give the guild of the fourth estate opportunity, to discuss the wines, , fruits and
sa!ads of California and such other articles as the hospitality of the Golden "West
provided for the visttprs. The busy caterers, assisted by \ several ladles of the
local fraternity, kept pace with the demands of the hour. , The orchestra played
from olives and bo! ads to meats, fruits, nuts and raisins. . A strong sentiment was
created among the visitors in favor of cruising off Angel Island for an indefinite
length of time, but the desire to see more of thÂ» Bay of San Francisco and to get
& near view of the historic battleship Oregon overcame other emotions. -
The photographers, professional and of the amateur grade, got in their work
after the lunch hour. Groups of lovely ladies were detached from the main
throngs aft, forward and on the pilot-house deck to lend the charm of. Southern
beauty and grace to the picture collections of the cruise. . . Â¦ Â¦ , Â¦
Running away from Angel Island Captain Trewren brought his boat so. near
the famous battleship Oregon that the excursionists and the sailor men exchanged
salutations. â¢ . â¢ â¢â¢'
The orchestra aboard the tug played the "Star Spangled Banner" and the audi
ence joined In Blnging the words of the national air. There was a universal de
sire expressed by the ladies and gentlemen of the Alabama party to go .aboard the
Oregon, and If the committees of the California Press Association and theÂ» San
Francisco Press Club having the entertaining of the visitors in charge will ar
range some hour for the editors and publishers to visit the ship and 6ee the guns
and turrets made memorable in American history, they will receive the unani
mous thanks of the Southern delegation. In any case. The Call
will try to arrange for such a trip. All the signs aboard the battleship, the
cheers and signals In response to the greetings from the tug signified that the
officers and others would be glad to receive the Alabama party. It is pleasant
to reflect that the distinguished families of the South are. again largely repre
sented in the army and navy of the united country and no one can entertain
greater pride in the achievements of the army and navy than that 'entertained by
those patriotic editors of Alabama and their captivating companions. Every ship
of the navy and every regiment of the army contains "boys" of .the South, and
many of them are Alabama "boys." And then the officers of the Oregon would
be enraptured by the eweet Southern way of dwelling lightly on ! the "r." The
Oregon was not the only ship of the country noticed. - The cutter Hugh McCul-
Icch that served as a dispatch boat between Manila and Hongkong, and which en r
tered the harbor of Manila when Dewey's cruisers went in to smash 'the Spanish
fleet engaged the attention of the visitors.
ThÂ» Union Iron Works, wh^-e the Ohio Is In progress of construction, did not
pet the overlook.' The tug Bteamed along to Hunters Point and then came about
for the run home. The guests from Alabama were impressed with the magnitude
of San Francisco, but what impressed them most was the. hospitality of Califor
nia. They epoke of the kindness shown to them by the citizens of Stockton and
Fresno. After reviewing the excursion on the bay tendered by The Call and specu
lating* on scheduled features of entertainments to come, they reached the happy
and complimentary verdict that Calif ornians were *just like Southerners in the
generous extension of hospitality. "We never expected to- meet such, kindness.
You are Just like our people in Alabama," exclaimed a lady who found special de
light in the trip. . , . -, : â¢
At the pier on the return J. A. Rountree, secretary of the Alabama Press As-
other received a spear thrust. m
On the other hand, the official returns show that in the various fights the For
ty-third killed 1693 Filipinos, wounded 325 and captured 1426 of the rebels. The reg
iment lost three h,orses, three rifles' and three ammunition belts, while it captured
from the enemy ninety-seven rifles, forty-two Â¦ cannon, 3557 rounds of ammunition
and $27,900 In Mexican money. The regiment was In 293 engagements in which
there were casualties and sixty-one engagements In which no casualties occurred.'
Two companies, L and M. of the Forty-third were recruited in California and
sailed from here in November, 1S99. The other companies were recruited f rom^ all
over the United States and sailed from New York on November 16, 1899. The entlrÂ©
regiment landed'ln Manila on January 1. 1900, and was at once sent to garrison
the Islands of ,Saraar and Leytc. As Samar is the third and Leyte the fifth In Rise
in the Philippines, the amount of work the men had to do can be imagined. At
first eight companies were stationed on Samar and four on Leyte, but later two
companies were sent from Samar to Leyte. â¢ Still later another regiment was sent
to Samar and the companies of the Forty-third doing duty there were sent to
Leyte. On May 29 last General Moxlca and all his men surrendered, and on June 1
the regiment sailed for Manila and four days later started for home.
â¢ From the colonel down every officer of the Forty- third has been under fire. ThÂ»

Colonel Arthur Murrey is very popular with his men and a splendid commander.
It wasldue to his disposition of his men that such excellent results were produced.
In order to garrison two islands there had to be a great deal of scattering, but
each little command was so placed that it could speedily call upon its neighbor for
assistance. It was due" to this fact that every officer in the. regiment got a*
chance to do some fighting on his own account. Colonel Murrey Is proud of his
regiment and its record shows that he la deservedly so. \
Â¦ Lieutenant Charles C. , Estes, who was . in forty-four engagements, has men
from, the ranks. -From 1S84 to 1S89 he wai private, corporal, sergeant and first ser
geant in the Third Artillery., In 189*? he was a. captain in the Eighth Volunteer In
fantry and, was mustered out In March. 1S39. On November 2, 1S99, he enlisted as a
private in the Forty-third and two weeks later he was: made a -second lieutenant.
The warmest engagement In which Estes took part was on Easter Sunday, April
15; 1S99. With/twenty-four men he was holding the village of Jaro on the island
'of ; Leyte. .'The. men were quartered in tha village church and everybody save the
sentry was asleep." At 4 a. m. over 1000 Filipinos appeared before the church and
.regiment lost two officersand sixty-seven men In battle. The' officers
were Lieutenants John H. Evans and Jonathan Cilley. Of the men, one was hanged
by the rebels in* Samar, one .was. captured and beheaded in Leyte. one was cap
tured andÂ«beheaded In. Samar. one -was drowned, six died from bolo wounds and the
others from various causes. ' - / . â¢ â¢ . . ,1 V
From January 27, 1900, to December 31, 1900. the official list shews seventy-two
officers and men wounded either in action or accidental}}*. Of these fifteen were
wounded by bolos in the hands of the enemy and nine were wounded accidentally
in various ways. Among the'se unlucky last was unfortunate Private John South,
who received three .gunshot wounds during an accidental engagement at Alansr

regiment to leave' Manila, but the men liked their quarters in the Islands
so well that many of them are anxious to go there again. Of all the vol->

LAST OF VOLUNTEERS HERE.
Away back in the hills Sweeney heard
of the peril of l:is command. The rescue
party Joined with his own men only made
a grand total of seventeen men, while the
rebels had been reinforced and must have
been 150D strong. Securing the launch
Laoang, Sweeney and his men raced down
stream to the rescue of their comrades.
Reaching Catutig the handful of men
jumped aehore and charged the Filipino
army. Thinking others were coming, the
rebels broke and fled. Lieutenant Sweeney
then retreated, taking with him the eleven
men he had rescued, and finally reached
the headquarters of the regiment.
Many of the officers of the Forty-third
trere made very happy by letters from the
War Department handed to them as soon
as the mail was opened. The letters con
tained the appointment- of the following
to the regular army: Captainsâ Golds
borougrh. Beavers. Duncan (of California).
Tilton, Hansen and Fair; first lieutenants
âDonnelly. Seaman, Sterrett, Burt. Phll
lpps, Swann and uasser; second lieuten
antsâJohnstone, Steele and Andrews. Be
sides these there were one or two others
whose names could not be learned. Among
them, however, was that of Sergeant Ma
jcr Edward K. Masisie, who has been ap
pointed a second lieutenant.
Lieutenant Sweeney's Daring.
When Lieutenant Sweeney started
across the island he left thirty-one men
in garrison at Catubig. He was not gone
.very long before General Lukbanand 1000
rebels appeared before the place and de
manded the surrender of the men. The an
fwer was a volley. The fighting went on
day after day, the Americans being picked
oft one at a time until only eleven were
left. Still there was no thought of sur
render, and for every American that fell
twenty Filipinos bit the dust.
The Filipinos had two cannon, which
they could not bring Into action owing to
the sharpshooting of the Americans. After
the fight the bodies of nineteen rebels were
found beside oae of the guns. The Fili
pinos attacked again and again with great
determination, but were finally driven off,
leaving 125 dead, one rifle, two cannon, 150
bolos and a silk flag- on the field.
On March 16 last Estes and his orderly
were ambushed by 150 Filipinos. The or
derly was killed but Estes cut his way
through the horde and escaped. .
Major W. E. "Wilder of the Fourth Cav
alry was also lieutenant colonel of the
Forty-third for a time. He was with Gen

Family Thrown From Carriage.
PACIFIC GROVE. June 27.-Mrs. J. C.
Lazier of Gonzales was seriously injured
In a runaway accident on the seventeen
mile drive this afternoon. She and her
children were thrown out of a carriage
and all were hurt.' Mrs. Lazler's right
shoulder was fractured. Mrs. Lazier is
the wife of the cashier of the Bank of
Gonzales and a sister of the late Sheriff
of Monterey County, H. R. Farley, who
was killed by George Suisser last year.
The court then reviews decisions bear
ing upon the rolnt, and holds that the
law under which the proceedings prelim
inary to the bond issues were had was
superseded by the act of 1901. and the Is
sue being Incomplete at the time the
former law became null and void, the
bond is Invalid.
"It is my opinion, therefore." concludes
the court, '.'that all the proceedings for
the issue of this $2,090,000 of bonds have
become void ana that they cannot now bÂ«
'issued or sold' under the act of February
?5, nor under any law that authorized
their Issue at the tima they were voted
by the people."
LOS ANGELES, June 27.â A- decision
was handed don-n this morning by Judge
Noyes of Uie Riverside .County Superior
Court, sitting for Judge Shaw of the Su
perior Court of Los Angeles County, de
claring the water bonds issued- by the
city of Los Angeles invalid.
The aggregate, value of the bonds is $2,
090,000, and they were issued for thÂ© pur
chase of the Improvements of the Los An
geles City Water Company. None of the
bonds have been sold on account of the
question of their legality. The action in
volving their legality and decided this
morning by Judge Noyes was brought by
Henry D. Barrows, a taxpayer of Los An
geles, to set aside the proceedings leading
up to the issue cf the bonds. Judge Noyes
In the course of his decision said:
The proceedings leading up to the Issue of
these bonds were begun under a general latr
regulating the procedure for the issue of bonds,
but before said bonds were It-sued or sold the
Legislature passed an act entitled "an act
authorizing the Incurring of Indebtedness by
cities, towns and municipal corporations for
municipal Improvements, regulating the acqui
sition, construction and completion thereof."
This act became a law under the constitutional
provision without the Governor's approval. Feb
ruary 25. 1901, and the same Is now the law
of the State governing the Issue of bonds o!
municipal corporations. '
Had these bonds been voted, siyned. sold and
issued In accordance with the law under which
the proceedings for their issue were originally
commenced, there could, of course. bÂ« no ques
tion as to their validity In so far as this onÂ»
question Is concerned, but. some of the most
important proceedings are yet to bÂ« had before
they can become available as assets of the city
for the purpose for which they were voted. The
question therefore, presents itself: Does the act
of February 2S. 1901. now control In the sale and
Issue of municipal bonds? If such be the case,
does not such act supersede the general aet
under which the said bonds were issued and
must not all proceedings be had under the act
of February 25, 1901?

SANTA CRUZ, June 27!â The Supreme
Court has decided the suit of the county
of Santa Cruz against. McPherson &"Wal
dron, proprietors of the Sentinel, in favor
fft the defendants. The case is of interest
to all publishers, as, it virtually settles
the question as to the number of times a
delinquent tax list should be published.
The law states that the list must be pub
lished once a week for three consecutive
weeks.
Acting- upon the advice of attorneys, the
defendants published the list four times
in 1S95 and the bill was allowed by the
Supervisors.. Subsequently the county
brought suit to recover $1035 25 on the
ground that the publication the fourth
time was illegal and therefore an over
charge.
Judge Doollnp of Hollister sustained a
demurrer, from which the county took
an appeal. The court in Its decision sus
taining Doolins says: . â
"The action of the Board of Supervisors
in awarding a contract for the printing
of the delinquent list and in subsequently
allowing- the claim therefor under the cir
cumstances disclosed by the complaint is
conclusive Â¦ of the matter and in face of
such action it cannot be said that the
money was paid to the defendants without
authority of law.
"The order of the board duly made con
stituted 'authority of law.' The Board of
Supervisors was the proper tribunal be
fore which to make objection that the
claim for printing was excessive by rea
son of fraudulent conspiracy or for any
other reason, and the board having taken
due action in the matter all objections
that might have been made to the claim
before it are precluded." ' .

Suffering
From Dyspepsia and Stomach Trouble.
Instantly Relieved and Permanently Cured
by Stuart's Dyspepsia
;-> :; > ' Tablets.
A New DiwoTsry. tat Not a Pattnt Xediclnt.
"Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
case of acute stomach trouble and chronic
dyspepsia by the use of the new discov-
ery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "ThÂ« patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach,
tie had pains like rheumatism in the
back, shoulder blades and limbs, fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetita
.and loss of flesh; the heart became affect-
ed, causing palpitation and sleeplessness
at night.
"I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a 50-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given and af-
ter he had used four boxes he was to all
appearance* fully cured.
' "There was no more acidity or sour,
watery risings, no bloating alter meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between 10 and 12 pounds lm weight
of solid, healthy flesh.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and seld in drag stores, yet
I consider them a most valuable addition
to any physician's line of remedies. 83
they are perfectly harmless and can be
given to children or Invalids or in any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
"Without any qestion they are the
safest, most effective cure for indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe."

AMERICAN WHEAT
TO RULE WORLD
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
CHICAGO. June 27.â In 1M0 France inn
ported only 16,152,000 bushels of wheat- Of
this amount the United States supplied
less than 1,500,000 bus*hels, but exports
from Argentine Republic were nearly
double those of former years. Russia "also
had a good crop and exports were heavy.
This year It is estimated that Russia will
export less than In 1900, and Argentine
20,000,000 bushels less.
That being true, the United States will
probably supply the bulk of France's
wheat deficit. Jt is hard to approximate
the cost and profit of such a movement.
In 1&00 the average export price for the
United States crop was 72 cents a bushel,
but the total crop of this country amount
ed to only 522.229,505 bushels. This year
the estimates are that the total crop of
this country will be 700,000,000. Granting
that the increased demand abroad win
maintain the price at 72 cents, the bill for
supplying the total French, wheat deficit
Â¦would be $25,923,000, asuming the amount
of that deficit to be 36,000,000 bushels. Just
what exact amount the United States will
supply it is impossible to estimate cor
rectly.
F. G. Ix)gan, head of one of the largest
commission houses in Chicago, said to
night:
"Estimates which I have obtained place
the figures as high as G0,000,000 bushels.
Only the United States can supply this
deficit. The winter crop of wheat is now
made, and the prospects for the spring
crop are excellent. A conservative esti
mate places our yield fcr the year at
750 OOO.WX) buahels. The average for recent
vears was only 500.000,000 bushels. This
country yearly exports 200,000,000 bushels
of wheat. It Is easy to see, therefore,
that we can supply France's deficit with
out feeling It. Russia's yield of wheat
has been declining durin*" the last few
vears, and the same may be said with re
gard to certain countries of South.Amer
ica. Confcequently the prospect for the
United States to come to the front and
assert her commercial and agricultural su
premacy was never better than It is now."
BOERS CAPTURE
FIVE SANGAR5
Special Dlsnatch to The. Call.
CAPE TOWN, June 27.â Boer invaders,
under Malan and Smit, about 3000 strong,
attacked Richmond early Tuesday morn
ing. The town was defended by a de
tachment of the North Staffordshire Mi
litia under Captain Hawkshaw and ths
town guard.. Three sangars outside the
town were captured by the Boers, the
garrison being distributed principally at
the Jail fort and the Flagstaff Hill fort.
Owing to the capture of the sangars,' the
Flagstaff Hill fort was exposed to a
heavy fire.
Three times during the day Command
ant Malan sent messengers demanding
the surrender of the town, and each time
the demand was refused. The Boers took
advantage of an opportunity during the
cessation of the hostilities to better their
posltigns and on the last occasion when
the messenger was sent In a party of
burghers entered the town and effected
the capture of the sangar In the market
square. Not a shot was fired on account
of the white flag carried by the mes
senger.
The Boers, who were now only 200 yards
from the Jail fort, were securely covered
and directed a continuous flre for two
hours upon the defenders, who stoutly
held their position. Finding it imposslb'e
to capture the jail fort, the Boers turned
their attention to another sangar in the
town, held by eight men. These eight
men, after having held the position *oi
eleven hours, surrendered at 5 o'clock in
the afternoon. . . â¢ Â¦
After dark the British garrison
strengthened the fortifications, as they
anticipated a renewal or the attack in the
morning. During the night, however, the
Boers learned that relief was approach
ing for the besieged men and, withdrew.
They captured twelve horses and looted
the stores.-
The engagement lasted twelve hour;-.
The Boer loss is reported as five men
killed and seven wounded. The British
casualties are not given. On Wednesday
morning Colonel Lunds, with the relieving
column, entered the town.
I am of the opinion that the property cap
tured on the land was not intended to be made
a maritime prize, and that It Is excluded by
the tej-ms of the act from which the right is
sought to be derived, and that the libellant Is
not entitled to an adjudication In prize of the
appraised value of such property appropriated
by the United States. This renders unnecessary
the consideration of the effect of . the treaty
with Spain upon the rights of â¢ the libellant.
The next question Â¦ is whether the libellant is
entitled to the condemnation in prize of the
value of the property taken from the vessels
sunk or otherwise destroyed. It is objected
that inasmuch as the libellant has received
bounty for the destruction of these vessels he
is not entitled as prize for the -property taken
from them; that bounty la a substitute for the
prize itself, something given, "in lieu of it."
Bounty Is not an equivalent for prize." There
is, therefore, / no reason / arising out of the
amount paid as bounty that would Justify the
claim that, in fairness such reward should be
exclusive. I find nothing to prohibit the con
demnation In prize of : the ' property captured
or. taken from the ships sunk or destroyed, In
addition to- the bounty paid for the destruction
of the ship, and I am of opinion that It
should be 1 allowed. . . -. '. ** . ..â¢ . .
That Rear Admiral Sampson and the of
ficers and men under his command are en
titled to one-half the value of the Infanta
Maria Teresa,' which was raised and sub
sequently abandoned; the Reina Mercedes,
Sandoval and Alvarado and the' muni
tions of war and the other property taken
from the vessels they destroyed.
The court declared that the property
captured on the land by the naval force
operating from the sea Is not a lawful
prize. This point has never been passed
upon by the Supreme Court, and an ap
peal may be taken. On this point Judge
Bradley says:
That Admiral Dewey 'and the offlcers
and men under his' command are entitled
to one-half the value of all the vessels
sunk in the battle of Manila Bay and sub
sequently raised; of the guns, the mu
nitions of war and, other property taken
from the Spanish vesels which were sunk
in the engagement. . They are not entitled,
however, to prize money for the property
captured on the shore or for the cascos
and other harbor vessels taken subsequent
to the engagement. ' . ;v;
This is the decision of Judge Bradley
of the Equity Court of the District of Co
lumbia. Briefly, the court held: **
CAL.L. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., "WASHINGTON, June 27.â Besides re
ceiving bounties for the destruction of the
fleets of Admirals Montejo and Cervera at

During the afternoon an Informal meet
ing, of directors of Important banks was
held at a downtown -club and the suspen
sion of the Seventh National and its rela
tions with other financial institutions 'was
thoroughly discussed. A tacit-understand
ing that all Interests should be protected
was arrived at. ' .'.>'Â¦.- â¢
Edward Thomas, president of the Seventh
National Bank, stated that the difficulties of
the bank were due solely to the making- by the
previous executive officers of large advances to
Marquand & Co., and that the security thereon
was of an unmarketable character, although of
considerable intrinsic value. That upon the
urgent application of the board, he and his as
sociate, Edwin II. Gould, had furnished finan
cial assistance . upon adequate securities and
upon the assurance that the obligations of Mar
quand & - Co. would be made good by this
morning. That the firm named had however
failed to fulfill expectations and while he and
Mr. Gould and some of the directors were will
ing to furnish further financial aid, It was not
deemed by them, as Just either to the deposi
tors, stockholders or the public to invite de
posits and credits until the affairs of the batik
were again' placed upon an absolutely safe ba
sis. That for this purpose reasonable time was
necessary, and to prevent' unfaiir i preference or
advantages, the board determined, with the ad
vice of counsel, to suspend operations for the
present.
The Associated Press issued no such
bulletin nor carried any such bulletin Jike
it in statement or purport.
William Nelson Cromwell, special coun
sel for the bank, gave out the following
statement from President Thomas and
added that he was engaged in preparing a
plan for reorganization of the affairs of
the bank, and that it was believed that
a satisfactory plan would be presented at
an early date:

"The Associated Press issued a bulletin'
which was published in the Evening Jour
nal. It said that bankers were blaming
the administration '.. for neglecting to ex
amine the Seventh National. Favoritism
because of the political friendship of
Perry S. Heath, the dominant director,
was charged."
Alleged Story of Favoritism.
For two days under the watchful eyes
of President Tappan, chairman of the
Clearing-house Committee, all exchanges
have been made. On Tuesday the bank
was saved by President Thomas, who
paid a debit- balance of $953,000, and on
Wednesday by Edwin Gould** who drew
his personal check for $224,000 for the same
purpose. To-day the bank had a debit of
$644.108 95. due to the withdrawal .of de
posits of out of town banks, and after
consultation the directors informed the
Clearing-house they had decided to sus
pend.
The Marquand loan was incurred within
the period of a. month, and is secured by
collateral of which one bank president
said to-day: "I would not be found dead
with such collateral in my, bank."
The loan is secured among other things
by some $G00,000 or $700,000' of bonds of
the Pittsburg, Shawmut and' Northern
road and "sweetened" with Hackensack
Land and Improvement Company securi
ties, stock of the Marquand building in
Broadway and stocks and bonds of the
Gas and Electric Company of Bergen
County, New Jersey.
Financiers thought otherwise. It was
an open secret that the Clearing-house
committee had examined the bank's col
lateral and after examining it had refused
to render assistance, which has never be
fore been' withheld from a bank -which
was simply unfortunate. Besides that It
was known that when Mr. Thomas bought
hi3 way to the presidency of the institu
tion the enormous amount he advanced,
$983,000, went to meet a Clearing-house
debt balance and did not alter the'status
of the Marquand loan. â¢ - ....... .
Mr. Thomas has achieved his ambition
to become a bank president, but at a
heavy cost. Rumors were afloat that he
had pone to the bank's assistance with
out- consulting his father,, General Sjim
uel Thomas. It was the expected which
happened in Wall street to-day when the
failure was announced. The general pub
lic did not appreciate t;ie situation, â¢ and
was misled by the reassuring statement
of the officials, who asserted that every
thing had been arranged for the protec
tion of the bank. . N
Thomas' Costly Ambition.
& Co. of ?1,600,000 was the cause of the
failure. That firm weathered the storm
again to-day. The burden of the failure
is placed by President Thomas on former
executive officers, and Washington * dis
patches attributed the blame to William
H. Kimball, former president of the bank.'
About three iRonths ago the saf a in the
Sotoyome House in Healdsburgr waa
opened and money was taken from If. It
la thought â¢ by some that this caused
Reed's arrest. It is rumored to-night
that a reward of $1600 Is offered for the
man's capture. Sheriff Grace does not
entirely deny this story, but seeks to cre
ate an impression that the case is not im
portant.

The resolution also instructs the chair
man of the meeting to appoint a commit
tee to "conduct the contest and confer
with all organized friends of reform. In
completing an independent ticket."
The resolutions adopted by the meeting
pay a tribute to Mr. Rothermell for hia
fidelity and integrity and formally nom
inate him as a candidate for District At
torney to succeed himself.
He closed by saying the battle -was not
one of party, but onÂ© of self-preservation
and against organized crime, a corrupt
ballot, a looting of the public treasury.
i Former District Attorney O. D. Gra
ham, who served eighteen years Jn that
office, followed McClure. He strongly
urged the citizens to stand united, and he
felt confident that the "patient and suf
fering public will rise and annihilate the
robber crew and give back to the people
the civil government."
Colonel McClure told how the street
railway bills were rushed through, the
Legislature and how !the Governor had
signed them at a "convenient hour so that
the gang's representatives could be first
at the door the next morning to get char
ters."
their associates. They are committing
public robbery by criminal conspiracy."
McCluro did not mince words, and his ar
raignment of the whole Republican or
ganization, both city and State, was ex
tremely severe. District Attorney Roth
ermell. he said, -was nominated by the
Republican Â¦ organization three years ago
and elected. Now. this same organization,
controlled by the same men, refuse him
another term. They have named a man,
he continued, who Is untried and an un
known quantity. Mr. Rothermell sent to
prison ballot box thieves, the masters of
whom are the political leaders of the city
to-day. He had also made It so uncom
fortable for others of the same stripe that
they were living in distant lands and can
not come home until Rothermell is out
of office. That was the reason, he said,
why Mr. Rothermell was not named.
Colonel McClure then told of Mr. Weav
er's unknown quantities and said:
"Mr. Weaver has been nominated by
these men because they have been either
assured or resonably believe that he will
prosecute or not prosecute crime as their
Interests might demand. The issue has
been intensified by the- most bewildering
public robbery ever witnessed in the
State, and the men most interested are

Keene's ear burst while the machine was
leaving JBastogne in Belgium. Mr. Keene
was thrown Into a potato field, but was
not seriously hurt. At Rheims M. Bra

, I. don't; expect to win, but I am going for the
.sport of the thing. I never participated in a
race of this kind ,bef ore. My autocar Is quite
new. -I drove it for the first time Tuesday
and I find the tension is terrible. My car ought
to go eighty-five kilometers an hour, so appar
ently I stand a fair chance In the race, but
I shall not g-et the best speed out of It, aa I
have not had sufficient experience with It.
Foxhall Keene got* away at 7 o'clock.
He wore a blue serge suit, covered with a

OFF FOR BERLIN
Taking in the situation at a glance, the
pugilist ran across the street to intercept
the horses. As they passed him in their
mad career he jumped for a rein that was
hanging loose from the horse nearest him.
Holding on with all his might and brac
ing himself against the railroad track3
that line the avenue, he drew back. The
effect of this movement, which was all
done in a good deal less time than It
takes to tell it, was to throw the horse on
its . hauncher and to bring both to a
standstill, where- they snorted and ca
reened to no purpose.
Joe Bernstein, who is matched with Cal
lahan. has rounded into shape and seems
happy over hl3 chance to win a fight, and
a few bets for all concerned. Bernstein
is a shifty ana strong man, but when he
shakes hands with Callahan to-niarbt hÂ«
will meet his equal in every degree. Great
interest is centered in this first number
on the programme.
Root came out of his quarters just after
some heavy work with his trainers In
time to see a team of horses attached to a
grocery wagon dashing down Central ave
nue at a galloping pace. Not a hundred
yards in front of them, were several chil
dren playing a game of some kind in the
street, and totally oblivious of the im
pending danger.
Root's last day at Alameda was put in
by some heroic, racking life-saving. The
story goes as follows:
ALAMEDA, June 27.â Jack Root, who Is
training at Johnny Croll'a for his light
with "Kid" Carter of Brooklyn, turned
hero this afternoon and saved a group of
children playing in the street near his
training quarters from being trampled be
neath the feet of runaway horses. Root
is not saying much about his own bravery
and is inclined to look upon It as some
thing that Â¦ ought to be expected of him,
but friends who saw say that he did a
brave act, with no little danger to hl3
own life and limbs.
and Carter, the light heavy-weights, and
Bernstein and C'allahan, lightweights, who
have Just graduated from the feather
class. These four men will meet to-night
in fistic combat . and the public antici
pates two contests far beyond anything
seen of late in San Francisco.
Both Root and Carter are trained to a
nicety.

The freshxnen race and the four-oar
contest preceded the big event of the day.
The freshmen eights were, sent off up the
river for their two-mile row just alter 5
o'clock. Yale was at the railroad bridge
at 4:45 and the Harvard youngsters were
â¢five minutes behind. It required nearly
fifteen minutes for the crews to take their
places in the shells. Yale took the lead
at the start and was never headed. The
blues led by three-quarters of a. length at
the half-mile, a length and a half at the
â¢mile and In the last mile by work superior
In every department of rowing easily
â¢ croEsed the line four and a half lengths
ahead. The time, was: . Yale 10-27 4-5
Harvard 10:48.

'On the water at tne navy yard, at the

Attorney Frank Powers notified Acting
Auditor Wells yesterday that he would
enjoin the. payment of the. claims of
teachers for . November and December;
1898, unless they agreed to return the sum
of $7000 , which, was surrendered under an
a greement by " merchant ' creditors in May, 1
1899.'- At that time about $27,000 was de
posited , with the Union Trust Company'
pending the outcome of litigation to-de
termine-- whether the teachers, or mer
chants were entitled to the money. -^ A"
compromise.- w as * afterward effected,
whereby the merchants released the sum;
of 57000 tothe teachers, who received a
small percentage of their Individual sal
ary demands, less about $400 spent as at-,
torney's fees. It is this $7000 that Powers
wants returned to the merchants/ Â¦
Acting Auditor Wells declined to hold
out the sum named, as he thinks the,dis
pute is a mattef to be settled between the
teachers and/ merchants. Powers there
upon expressed his intention to sue out a
writ of injunction, to restrain the Auditor
from paying the teachers the full amount
of the balance due them until the mer
chants are paid the $7000. The agreement
under which the suit will be brought fol
lows: :
The merchant creditors having claims against
the school fund of 1898-1899, which the Union
Trust Company holds as their assignee, shall
execute and deliver to the Auditor and to the
Teachers' Committee a written agreement to
the effect that the . merchant ' creditors and
the. Union Trust Company, agree that none of
their unpaid demands shall be audited or paid
until all of the salary demands of teachers and
janitors for November, 1898, shall have been
audited and there shall have come into the
fechool fund of 1898-1899 a sufficient sum to pay
all- of the demands for November, 189S, the
Union Trust Company ' to pay Auditor "Wells

Burglars who. yesterday morning broke
into the saloon of C. Eastman, at the cor
ner of Mason and Ellis streets, en
deavored to hide their crime' by deliber
ately setting fire to the premises.
i When Proprietor Eastman closed the sa
loon at 2 in the morning he carefully
locked the side and front doors and went
*to his residence at the corner of Turk
and Jones streets. .. .
At 4:30 yesterday morning Police Of
ficer Harry Hook and Special Officer Mas
sey were walking along Ellis street and
tried the side door of Eastman's saloon.
The door yielded to their touch and when
it opened a volume of smoke poured out
into the street.
Hook turned in a fire alarm and with
Massey dashed into the saloon and put
out the flames that were licking the walls
of the premises. In the rear of the sa
loon where two "private ' boxes" were lo
cated, the ; officers discovered three-dis
tinct" fires. Heaps of oil-saturated paper
were lying on the floor. The burglars had
set fire to the paper in the hope of de
stroying the saloon and wiping out all
Â¦traces of robbery. . -
The officers took buckets of Â¦ water and
before the fire apparatus arrived suc
ceeded ' in Quenching the flames that
threatened to destroy the building.
The proprietor of the saloon was called
to the scene by , Willis Davis, who for-:
merly worked as a bartender for East
man. Eastman informed the police of
ficers that when he left his saloon he had
carefully locked the place., The front
door is fastened with a Yale lock, whilo
the side door has only an ordinary lock
that could be opened with a skeleton key.
. Fire Marshal Towe questioned Eastman
and .was satisfied that he had no knowl
edge of the cause of the fire. Detectives
Wren and DInan were placed on the case
by Chief of Detectives Seymour and they
learned that a number of hoodlums had
been .In the habit of frequenting East

drinks and loans of moneys .Eastman in
formed the detectives that he suspected
his saloon had been set on fire by some
of these hoodlums, and that he especially

â¢ eights to prepare. At exactly 7 o'clock
Â¦j* the Yale oarsmen launched their shell at
V Broadview and five minutes later were
"paddling leisurely to the starting point
f^ half a mile down the river. Harvard was
jjr but two minutes behind Yale and went
Â«*,. across the river to the accompaniment of
3... the Harvard band.
â¢*Â£ There was no loss of time and at 7:14
i-S both boats were in position, receiving in-
V Etructions from the referee. Yale had the
vj east course, while Harvard occupied the
rfwest The pistol was tired at 7:15. It was
â¢V a start almost on even terms, Harvard
â¢Â» possibly having a slight advantage. For
*! three lengths it was stroke for stroke at
r*~ihirty-six to the minute. Yale then
-:â¢ dropped to thirty-five, whilÂ© Harvard
~, T went down to thirty-four.
J" Tbfi! water was smooth, although there
S was a slight breeze from thÂ« southwest.
-" Before ten lengths had been- traveled it
.." was . evident the race was to be a ffood
j" one. Harvard had drawn away by a quar
-' ter of a length. The eights were rowing
fc 'as'one tnaxu At the half mile it was
"yf Harvard by a narrow bargin. a second
., and a fifth, as to the time, and still a
~ r quarter of a length as to distance. As the
_ lir^i ilags of the course were passed Yale
V was rowing thirty-five and Harvard was
Jrone point lower. Harvard had settled
i'down into the best work of her race, and
ywith a beautifully steady pull the Cam
abridge boys sent their shell still further
p ahead. Yale, too, was rowing magnifi
y cently, but at this stage of fhe race did
jr"not display the dash of the Harvard men.
at the mile it began to look
.v like Harvard. Her boat was four and
*sT two-fifths seconds ahead of Yale at the
r one mile flag, a comfortable length to the
...good. At this point, however, Yale's
/spirit began to show Itself and a little
V more "go" appeared in the New Haven
~ craft. Slowly, but surely, Yale gained,
.: and in the next half mile cut Harvard's
..'lead down to a scant half length.- The
-t difference In the time was two and four
fifths seconds. Both crews were rowing
.-. like clockwork and there was every indi
i-, cation that each eight was able to stay
'./out- the entire four miles. Passing the
â¢ mile and a. half Yale lowered her stroke
5 *Â¦ and Harvard followed, and for the rest
r of the race, with the exception of beauti
v ful spurts upon occasions, the crews hard
'Cly varied from thirty to tiurty-one. Yale's
' $ pull seemed to be the more telling. As
>$j the shells approached the navy yard there
, 'Â¦. ,was a perceptible gain for the blue and
*'when the mile flag was passed 'Â¦Yale was
-leading for the first time in the race. The
margin, however, was dangerously nar
row. Harvard was one second behind, but
on the next half mile she again wrested
the lead away from Yale, and at the two
and a half miles Harvard led by just
Â£ two-fifths of a second. - :
Those on the official yachts, some of
whom were oarsmen of former days, at
this juncture began to talk about the race
Â¦with enthusiasm. Thus far it had been
magnificent, and the performances of the
crews promised a heart-breaking finish.
The Yaie men pulled like giants, but Har
vard was working with just as much
power and skill. As a result Yale was
unable to creep up and ; Harvard actually
â¢ drew ahead still further one-fifth of a
'. *econd, passing the three-mile station
-Vthree- fifths of a second ahead. â¢ The
â¢â¢ lead of the crimson oars was to be estiâ
- mated not In lengths but in mere feet and
i. inches. The shells entered the finishing
-â¢'.-'mile with beautiful water conditions be
tween the long lane of yachts, and it re
mained for this last mile to afford the
most spectacular contest seen on the
Thames for many a year.
With guns booming and sirens shriek
ing the two boats swept down the line,
. " Harvard was still in the van, but Yale was
clinging to her close. It was not until the
three and a half mile flags were within
Â¦ hailing distance that Chittenden, the Yale
cockswain, called on- his men for a mighty
. effort. Up went the Yale . stroke and up
; - crept the Yale shell. Harvard tried to re
, - spond and her men answered, the call
heroically, but the sons of Eli tore along
in a style that was maddening for Har
vard supporters. The three and a half
r mile point found Yale again in the lead.'
â¢ Â£ She was never headed. ' Indeed, with Har
'â¢- vard never letting down for an instant,
Yale took on added strength and the Yale
men began to steal away by feet. It was
nothing but Yale after this, and feet be
came generous proportions of a length.
Then it. was one length and open water
t appeared for the tirst time. It was the
old story of a Yale crew with skill and
endurance to stay in the last stages of
the long- journey. Â¦ Yale's victory was won'
tby a scant two lengths. The time^ on ac
count of the low stroke rowed,- was' slow.

PHILADELPHIA, June 27.â The home team
won two games to-day from Chicago. The
first game was a batting matinee, Eason being
hit frequently and hard. Philadelphia captured
the second game by timely base hits, aided by
errors in the eighth inning. Attendance 4284.
Score, first game:
In the first inning, with Schwartz, Pabst
and Nordyke on the sacks. John. Reilly
rolled out a thrÂ«;e-bagger. Then the.Fris
co contingent showed what the word fa
natic means in the baseball dictionary.
McLaughlin in the fourth inning added
another sensational catch to his scintil
lating list. Graham sent the ball over by
the fence, but it was pulled, in by the
Senator of the left garden after a hard
and long run. â¢
Pabst may be a batter par excellence,
but he needs several applications of lim
bering-up ointment. A good first baseman
occasionally stops balls ; that are not
thrown right into his hands:
"Wanted for Umpire Tylerâ a ease of

SAN FRANCISCO.
San Francisco 6, Sacramento O.
A strange game and a good one was
played at 'Recreation Grounds -yester
day afternoon, when the Senators met the
Wasps in. the initial hostilities of the se
ries. At the outset the pretzel destroyers
fell upon Sapho Harper's curves for four
hits, which resulted in five runs. Then
Harper settled like stale beer and was
undiscoverable ever after. Iburg twirled
for the home team, and despite the eight
hits made off his delivery not a single
Senator crossed the bags for a run.
â¢ The Senators : were bombarded with ill
luck yesterday, jj On several, occasions the
smell of the rubber on the return journey
hit; their nostrils, but the scorer rang no
bell for Sacramento. The score:
Harper Was Found at Outset
but Settled in Surpris
ing Fashion. .

charge of disturbing the peace. '.He- was
arrested Wednesday afternoon " on" Sixth

been notified by several 'ladles* that a man

ing: insulting proposals to them. "\ ' '
Fontana happened to be on Sixth street;
between Market and Mission, ;. and
saw a man grab hold of Miss -Mary
Cleary, 14 Morris avenue, whom he knew.
Suspecting 'he was the man complained
of, the policeman asked him what he was
doing. . Henry replied that the lady was
his landlady, Mrs. Livingston of Howard
street, and that he had simply accosted
her. Fontana . placed him under arrest
and Â»he threatened the^. officer,, alleging
that he was making a serious mistake. ;
Miss Cleary was. in court yesterday
morning and told the Judge that Henry
struck her on the shoulder when she re
sisted him, and the Judge ordered'that
another charge of battery be booked
against him.. It was done and the case
was . continued until to-morrow. Henry's
only excuse was that he was , drunk. : â¢

pÂ»Â»â j HE British schooner Alexander ar-
I rived In port Wednesday night in
I distress. She was chartered here
j| about elx weelcs ago to take a gen
eral cargo of merchandise and' a
deckloadof lumber to Petropaulovsky. Si
beria. After the merchandise had been
put aboard she went to Ofays Harbor and
there took on ter decWoad of lumber. A
start was then made for the Siberian
coast- This -was on the 13th inst-, and all.
â¢went well for a time. Then It came on to
blow a gale-from the northwest and the
schooner was hove to. She labored a great
deal, and when in latitude 45 degTees
north, longitude 133 degrees west, sprung
a leak. The men worked on the pumps for
a couple of days, but when the captain
found the water was gaining he decided
to run for San Francisco for repairs. The
chances are that the Alexander's cargo
will be discharged and the vessel put on
the drydock.
Captain Lockluaxt Heard From.
About *Us months *go Captain Lock
hart and H. Olsen of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company. gave up their jobs
and prepared for a voyage to Nome. Over
at Sausallto they built a small schooner,
which they named the Helen. She was
provisioned, for two years, and on June 12
the adventurous pair, accompanied by two
sailors, started for St. Michael. When two
days out they ran into the northwester,
and soon, the seams opening up, the
schooner began to leak. Captain Lock
hart could r.ot make San Francisco again,
but was driven down to San Diego, where
the Helen now is awaiting an overhauling
and a change of weather.

The American officer detailed to study the South
African war reports that the Boers are not soldiers.
Considering what they have done, one may ask what
would have happened had they been soldiers? It
is worth while to remember that European officers
made the same comment on both the American armies
in our Civil War; yet it is probable that those armies
combined could have beaten the rest of the world in
arms.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Here, then, are two excellent thingsâ the suppres-;
sion of the" child labor system and an increase of the
public school system. Such movements will go fair
toward preserving the South from the reactionary
tendencies; of Bourbonism. They will help /to place
the social organism of the ,South _on the '"same", level
with that of the rest of the country,: and- when' that
occurs Bourbonism^ in politics . will .; vanish. ./ Indeed/
there arc already evidences of ; revolt against ?it,' and
the South may be said to be irnprovingali along the
The rule is to go Into effect: September 1. The as
sociation, it-is jinnounced, 'will urge* the Legislature
to increase 'the ; school facilities for the children of
the State, andthe members who represent the largest
arhount of property have ' declared a willingness to
bear the increase of taxation necessary to provide- a
long term of effective public school instruction.
. . According to the report of the proceedings, of the
association given, by the , Atlanta Constitution the
agreement recites "that the extended employment of
children growing out' of .local conditions . was riot
profitable, as the . leaks rnore than counterbalanced
the difference in wages that would be demanded by
more mature help; that hereafter under no circum
stances will children of 10 or under be employed; that
no child 'under 12 shall be employed at "night, save
in ease^ra widowed mother to whose support the
work rnay.be necessary, and that even this labor'will
notibe employed unless;it has four months' schooling*
each year."' ' Â¦ .' - ':, ' â¢ ! Â¦â
One of the: latest of these better . developments 13
the action taken by the _Georgia Industrial!Associa
tion to bring about the abolition of. ichildlabor.; The
issue has been under discussion a long tirne.V'In'fact,
a year ago the Georgia Legislature came very near
enacting, a stringent law forbidding such labor.' At
that time the mill-owners were opposed to the law,
but they have "since come Â¦ to the' conclusion to do
voluntarily what they objected to being forced to do.
WHILE'the actions of Alabama "and "Virginia
in following the lead of in- dis
franchising the negro show that Bourbon
ism is still the dominant element in Southern politics,
there are evidences that better elements are at work
in the social organism, and that they are greatly im
proving the- conditions ' of the Southern; people. ?
THE IMPROVING SOUTH.
A notorious gambler and a discredited. ex-Chief of
Police'of Seattle mixed things the othenday, and one
is dead and the other is in jail charged. with his mur
der. The pea'ce abiding citizens of the town are to be
congratulated -upon this improvement in. their con
ditions. â¢ Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ '- ' .
The subject is' Qne that deserves the. earnest atten
tion of educators in mapping out the/courses of in
struction to be given in the schools at the opening
of the coming term. We are collecting at. consid
erable expense of time and money a museum 6f com
mercial exhibits, and it will be nothing more than
common, sense to fit young men and young women
to use it to the iftst advantage for" their employers.
The University of California is well, equipped to
take the lead in raising the study of geography in Cali
fornia to the ', position it holds in Gefmany. The
influence radiating from -Berkeley would soon have
good effects on ; the public schools and colleges of
the State, and especially in this city, where geo
graphical knowledge is so rhuch in demand. Were
such instruction given, bur merchants would soon
be able to obtain in their, employ young men who
could make a much more profitable use of the Com
mercial Museum than others who lacked. the knowl-.
edge which comprehensive geography teaches. ' . .
Now that we have learned so profitable a lesson
from the East we might well endeavor to. make it
more profitable still by learning in connection with it
a lesson from the thoroughness with which the Ger
mans teach geography. The rapid advance of the
Germans in the commercial world, which is one of
the most remarkable features of the history of the last
twenty-five years, has been the result of many forces
working harmoniously together. Not the least among
them is the stimulus to foreign, commerce given. to
young men in the schools and in the universities by
instruction in geography in the fullest sense of th'e
word. Such instruction docs not consist. wholly in
physical geography, or political geography ;# riot in
teaching the student how to locate on a map a river
or a' town, but it embraces the whole relation of man
to the earth, deals with everything of industry; com

With that much accomplished or undertaken it is
fair to assume that within a comparatively short time
we shall have a commercial museum second only to
the great institution in Philadelphia. That it will be
widely beneficial there is no reason to doubt. The
history of the museum at Philadelphia is conclusive
upon that point, for it reveals the fact that there is
an urgent demand on the part of manufacturers and.
merchants for just such exhibits as the museum af
fords. The later and larger developments of the mu
seum have, in fact, been- caused by efforts fb meet the
demands of trade. and industry, and have been in no
sense an extension or expansion of the enterprise from
a mere desire for bigness. , Trade conditions on the
Pacific are not so widely different from those on the
Atlantic but that we may with reason expect the his
tory of the museum at Philadelphia to be paralleled
by that of the museum in this city. . W
GRATIFYING reports have been received by
the officials of the Pacific Commercial Mu
seum of the progress made in the work of col
lecting exhibits. The agent in Manila of the museum
gives assurance of an excellent collection of articles
of trade and industry from the Philippines, the ex
hibit of Costa Rica at the Pan-American exposition
is to be obtained for permanent exhibition here, and
instructions have been prepared to direct the work
of an agent in collecting exhibits from the various
countries of South America.
TRADE AND, GEOGRAPHY.
The need for the service. is great,* and the impor
tance of it is well understood by everybody. It is
therefore gratifying that Secretary Wilson has so
promptly given the Weather Bureau authority to
install a wireless sj'stem as soon as a suitable one has
been found. The system found suitable on the Nan
tucket lightship will certainly be suitable on the Faral
lones. It is therefore to be expected that action will
be taken to establish the service here as soon as it has
been successfully in operation there. ' Certainly there
should be no delay. There "is no telling what day
some vessel lying in the fogs off the Farallones may
be ia dire need of just such service as wireless teleg
raphy could give. It may be safely said that in a
matter of this kind every day is of value. Immediate
action is therefore in the highest degree desirable,
and it is to be hoped the Weather Bureau officials
will be prompt to make use of the authority granted
them by the Secretary.
We have, then, the prospect of an early establish
ment of the much desired service between San Fran
cisco and the islands which, lying thirty miles away
at sea, serve as an outpost from which information
can be dispatched of the approach of shipping, and
also from which news can be sent to the Weather Bu
reau of all the phenomena which are useful to' the ex
perts of the bureau in making forecasts of the weather.
The Herald" plant is to go into operation July 1.
There may possibly be some defect in the machinery
that will disappoint expectations at the first attempt,
but of the eventual success of the service there are no
doubts in the minds of those who have given any at
tention to the work which has been accomplished by
the Marconi system. The Herald itself, for the pur
pose of completing the tests of the system, made the
recent experiments of sending and receiving wireless
messages between various stations on the British
coast and the steamer Lucania as she made her way
down the channel to the open sea, and they were en
tirely successful.
SAN FRANCISCO'S interest in the approaching
operation of the wireless telegraph service
which the New York Herald has installed on
Nantucket lightship is hardly less than that of New
York itself. Thanks to Secretary Wilson, it is well
assured that as soon as possible after the successful
operation of the plant on the Nantucket lightship the
Weather Bureau will install a similar plant for the
purpose of establishing wireless communication be
tween the Farallones and this city.
THE NANTUOKBT TELEGRAPH.
At one of the meetings of the Y. M. C. A. con
ference in 'Boston there was read a message from
King Edward expressing sympathy with the work of
the association. In describing what followed the
Boston Journal said: "Everybody shouted, and those
who had not climbed. upon their chairs stamped and
jumped up and down in a kind q! frenzy, and the less
demonstrative, whose hands were not busy waving
something, applauded in more conventional way. The
vast audience, larger ..than at any previous session of
the convention; and more brilliant, perhaps, for it
was a so_rt of college night, had sprung to its feet
at the mention of King Edward's name. A moment
of roaring enthusiasm, and some quavering voice
started 'God Save the King.'" Evidently the boys
had been jubilating with too much Boston lemonade.
CALIFORNIANS Â¦ may- again congratulate
themselves- thafthey;live in a .climate where
heat arid humidity' are not associated. In our
rainy season'it'is not : hot, and in our -hot season it is
not humid. Heat and â¢* humidity are .'.-hunting ' in
couples just novy and slaying people by scores from
the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic! Coast' Drivers
fall dead from their seats ; and horses 'drop iri harness.'
The public hospitals are crowded ; with patients who
are prostrated by heat and humidity.
When the temperature* ran- from 92 at St. Paul arid
03 at Chicago to 102 at El /Paso, and the humidity
from. 70 to 90 , i$er cent, the maximum temperature
in California ,was 82 at Red Bluff, 76 at Sacramento,
84 at Fresno, 60 at San Francisco, 76 at Los Angeles,
and 64 at San; Diego; and the minimum temperature
at Red-Bluff was 60, at Sacramento 52, Fresno 52, San
Francisco 48, Los Angeles 58, and San Diego 60. A
little fire in open grates and fireplaces was found com
fortable, morning.and evening. The humidity in Cali
fornia was not worth recording. "
. . A study.of the Eastern heat and moisture discloses
the fact that the tropical isotherm runs into that af
flicted country in the summer, in respect both to heat
and humidity.' 'That same isotherm reaches far north
in California/but brings dry heat only, leaving its
moisture behind/ For an outsider to comprehend our
climatic advaritagesjit is necessary that he understand
this relation of Jieat and humidity. . â¢ ' ?Â¦' .
( If the country west- of' the \Rocky Mountains were
subject to a temperature . of go or 95, and an average
humidity of 85 for the greater part of the year, Â¦ it
would be uninhabitable to white men. Even now they
flee from the weather as from a pestilence, and by hun
dreds of thousands take refuge in far Northern re
sorts, on Lake Superior, the coast of Maine and in
the maritime provinces of Canada, while we are en
joying a little fire on the California hearth, or are at
work in a dry air at a temperature that would kill
thousands if associated with humidity.
In discussing tropical labor, the San Francisco
Chronicle says: fcWe do not believe it to be true
that white men cannot' labor in. the tropics. If is no
hotter there than in 'the. interior valleys of California."
The Chronicle might have.said truly that it is often
not as hot White men work in comfort in a Califor
nia dry temperature of 105, but the same men would
die in an hour in that temperature in Cuba, the Phil
ippines or Chicago. If the Chronicle thinks that trop
ical temperature and humidity are favorable to white
labor, why does it not praise this Eastern weather as
the best part of the year in that region, and advise
a rush thither from California? These insufferable,
conditions of heat and humidity in the Eastern part
of our own country, which lasf but a few weeks and
are intermittent, are the permanent conditions of the
tropics. People in this country are deceived by. the
report of temperature from Hawaii .and the Philip
pines. The maximum does not seem high, andVitHe 1

HEAT -^ND: HUMIDITY.
LOOKED at from the standpoint of availability for active
. service, the only true way to Estimate the efficiency of
the National Guard, Camp Gage was a success. Those
. , that went under the. tents last week in search of work
and .Instruction found both in, plenty. . Those that went In
search of play found but little, of it, and they have returned
complaining that the camp ground is too far from town, that
it was too big and that too little attention was paid to the
Instruction of the individual soldier..-.
It is true thafbut little time was spent upon the individual^
soldier, comparatively speaking, but 'the last day of the en-.
â¢campment showed. such a marked improvement in his knowl
edge and bearing that It was plain the "camp had supplied
many things in which he was lacking. Besides a soldier in an
army is a small thing. ' He is not even. a unit In the system un
til he has other men with him to forma squad, and since the
double rank formation was, adopted he IS only half as impor
tant as he was before. /In the guard, however, the individual
soldier seems to be paramount- He elects his officers and he
threatens them with failure of re-election if they go not his
way r in-;all things,- and' altogether the individual soldier has
much more consideration so far as his opinions, are concerned
than. he is entitled* to. The encampment was not for him as
an individual. It was for the soldier collectively, and particu
larly for his officers. Anything, in , the way of individual in
struction, if properly attended to, could have been taught In
1 the "armory before going â¢ into the field, and the camp could
then - serve its real > purpose â field Instruction. A few weeks'
drilling will make a'' good" soldier '.in all but experience, but it
takes years to make a good officer; and if the camp did no
more it demonstrated that the guard Is in need of good officers.
Real Discipline Lacking. .
The officers of the line maintained a fair discipline all
through the week, but it was not' the true discipline; not the
discipline and respect that comes for the. rank" and the straps
"regardless of the man; not the sort that prevented officers in
uniform from drinking and hobnobbing with men In uniform;
not the sort that made it Impossible for an order to be ques
tioned;^ not the sort that showed judgment In the handling
of the men and that- secured prompt obedience. The relations
between the. junior officers of the National Guard and the men
in the ranks are from a military standpoint entirely false, and
it is in' just those relations that discipline commences.
It Is' apparent there is nothing in the shape of Â«' man so
utterly helpless as a private soldier whose officers will not or *
cannot look out for him, and the encampment demonstrated
that should active service come there are many men who
would be in just that helpless condition. It is more important
to them if they are going to remain in the service that their .
officers be well trained than. that they themselves shall be well
trained, and such training can best be had In a large encamp
ment. The division camp developed the resources of the
Junior officers by giving them the duties that belonged to them
with only directory and not supervisory authority over them..
Every afternoon was left to the regiments to do as they
pleased. . Some company commanders used j the time In the
school of the squad and the school of the company; most of
them allowed their men to call It a half holiday with unlimited
passes. Yet they 'are the ones who are complaining that too
little was done for the individual, soldier. In a division en
campment the instruction of the. soldier belongs to the Junior
officers and to the sergeants If 'they be as. capable as they
should be. Field and general officers should have no time for
fours right and company lines. The Instruction of a sentry
belongs to the sergeant of the guard, and it can be done and
should be done by him. The camp demonstrated that fre
quently the instruction of a sentry was not beneath the duties
of a colonel.
It Is not the intention of the State that an encampment
shall furnish the school for the elementary instruction of sen
tries, of non-commissioned officers, of awkward squads and of
the dozen or two dozen other branches of the military art that
competent company officers can teach their men In their
armories, but it does contemplate the finish" of an armory edu
cation in the art of war. It expects that there shall be open
orde^, firing drills, skirmish lines of attack and defense, battle
rushes "and formations, the placing- of troops for assault and
to resist assault and all the points that governithe handling of
the men in the field and works for the purpose' of their organi
zation. It contemplates the teaching of the care of the men
in camp, their rations and their protection from disease within
as well as from assault, without, and the demonstration, sadly
necessary in the California Guard, that prompt and unques
tioning obedience, without any knowledge of the reasons for
it;' are the first attributes of a soldier, be he in the ranks or
bearing shoulder 'straps. With all this to : be crowded Into a
week. the Instruction of the individual soldier is a small ques
tion. He is to bÂ» considered only in his collective capacity.
; A Few of the Breaks.
An Instance of -this willingness on 'the part of Juniors to
take, charge of situations themselves was in the departure of
the First Infantry and the artillery battalion from this city.
The orders were that, the artillery should follow*he Infantry,
as It does rn all cases, even when the commanding officers are
of equal rank, but the artillery, started first from this city and
arrived first in camp. And the same thing happened at. the
breaking up. It may be urged that the artillery was ready
first, 7 but that has nothing to 'do with the situation. 'Again, to
go farther up the line, but one of the ; brigadier generals re
ported himself ready to leave the camp on the break-up. When
they were, ready they got out, leaving -the .time an indefinite
quantity until the commands started. And In smaller things â
It .was the custom for the "first few mornings for each brigade
to pipe up reveille and rout out its bands whenever the brig
ade timekeeper found the hour had arrived. There should not
have been a note until the call. from the guardhouse and the
raising" of *the-flagf..at-divlsiqn headquarters. There was noth
ing serious about any of those" and the many more little breaks
that occurred, but It showed plainly the desire to "go It alone 1 '
that. is. not part of a good military system. A right assumed
has : limits more or less indefinite, and it may.be exercised in
things Important as well as in things trivial. * In an 'enemy's
country it might easily become advisable that all calls be dis
pensed with. 'A brigade reveille under those circumstances,
that did not wait for._ a | call from headquarters, might prove
welcome information to an f opposlng outpost. â¢'
; the drills in open order, and above all in the practice
marches, ' was where the great work of the" encampment was
done; but they were almost entirely, drills more for the officers
than the men. It. is' easy or comparatively so for a soldier to
learn'how to "fire at will," to fire aSlimlted number of rounds
or to fire in "volley," but it takes longer to teach his officer
when to order the fire at will, the limited number of rounds or
the volleys. In the meantime the soldier should be able to get

CHANCE TO SMILE
One more thing was demonstrated by the division encamp
ment tha> Is important. The matter of transportation should
be separate and distinct from the camp allowance. If it costs
a regiment $1000 to go into camp at Santa Cruz and but $100 to
camp but a few miles from home, the saving in transportation
is Its best argument against traveling to a division encamp
ment The camping allowance should not be drawn upon until
the regiments have pitched their tents and occupied them, nor
after they are struck and the regiment starts for home It
costs the regiments of the First and Third brigades twlco as
much to camp with the division as it does tho regiments of.
the Second Brigade, yet the allowances are the same. Money
saved on transportation means more to spend on equipment
so the element of geography becomes an important one It
would be better if the State transported the regiments to* the
ground and home again and allowed them cash only for their
subsistence while in camp and for their equipment.
So in the last division encampment the complaint that there
was not enough individual instruction for the soldier means
that the junior officers did not attend to their duties; It means,
too, that there was no time and no place to do the work that
should have been done in the armory; It ia a protest against
the fact that the camp was not one for recruits, but one for
soldiers. A division encampment means that all the organiza
tions m the guard shall be placed side by side In their true re
lations to one another and as parts of a whole In which the
identity of each Is lost . That many of both the officers and
men do not see It In that light does not alter the fact, for that
is what active service means, and unless the guard ia carried
along with active service as its end and aim It is a useless ap
pendage to the treasury. The encampment brought out forci
bly what was apparent before, that what the guard needs is a
better appreciation of the principles of the military system, a,
greater willingness to perform the duties of one rank without
seeking higher "authority without higher rank, and a greater
unwillingness to accept high rank or any rank without having
or seeking to acquire the knowledge necessary to support it.
Men have been elected as good fellows In the guard to com
mands that place them absolutely, should they be called into
active service, in charge of the safety and the lives of scores
if not hundreds of men, and tbey have hardly the military abil
ity to attend to. their own safety. There are many -wtio are
soldiers no deeper than their uniforms. ' '..
The tour of duty in Santa Crus went to show that the
sooner a center of authority is recognized In the National
Guard of this State the better. Quicker than anything else,
the division encampment showed that companies and bat
talions are, after all, but small things when they become part
of an army, and it is so they should be treated. It ia hard for
an officer who knows his duties to give way to one who he is
sure doe's not, but that Is the service, and unless there is a
willingness to do so the whole thing must fall. It Is hard for
a private in the ranks to' realize that after all his rifle is the
only thing about him of any Importance, and that It is really
more serious not to have it clean than not to be clean himself,
but the fact remains, and nowhere Is It better demonstrated
than In a divisionÂ»encampment. In a squad in the skirmish
line a man ia a man, but In a battle line stretching across three
miles of country a man is no more than a spot on the hillside.
It is then he begins to realize that his life Is In the hands of
those above him. and when as a national guardsman he has a
chance to elect hia officers he should remember that and elect
good ones. A tent in the open with. five men In It is a con
tplcuous thing, but in a division encampment it is but a patch
of canvas with two flies and a half of men under it. All this
to the man who is in the guard for fun Is disagreeable, but the
enthusiasts understand It and are satisfied. It Is the base of
the military principle that it should be so.
Competent Officers Necessary.
The quartermaster's department showed itself efficient ia
every way. Colonel Rlckon, the division quartermaster, was
called home the second day and the arduous duties of the de
partment fell upon Major J. TV. A. Off, quartermaster of the,
First Brigade. A better man could not have been selected.
Contracts were made in onÂ© and everything was done through
the_ division, the principal result tot which system will be a
large savins In the expense.
The commissary department was in the bands of lieuten
ant Colonel Huber, and It ran along without a hitch until one
day one of the regiments complained that it had not enough
to eat. The complaint was investigated and It was found that
of the day's ration of meat there was still enough for another
meal, when it should have been dealt out to companies to the
last 'pound. An overzealous commissary had tried to make a
day's ration go half again as far as the commissary depart
ment expected or wished, and his command went short in con
sequence. There was a lesson that was of vital importance to
the regiment, although It had no individual instruction to the
soldier worked Into It.
The signal corps men worked harder than any set In camp.
They strung wires and established communication between
headquarters all through the grounds, and . their work on thÂ©
practice marches made apparent the reason the Government
was so willing: to take them at the opening of the war.
Colonel McCarthy's field hospital was as well equipped aa
the best in the city, and the canvas walls in place of those
hard finished made up the greatest difference. The principal
trouble was a lack of patients, for the camp was an aggres
sively healthy one.
Division Staff Efficient.
It was in the departments of the Â« staff, however, that thÂ«
camp found Its greatest field for Instruction. The division staff
proved itself an efficient body of men,, partly because each man.
is skilled in the department to which he has- been assigned.
,but mainly because all are enthusiasts: but even as it was it
was a valuable experience to them and quite as Important to
the man in the ranks, who will reap the benefits of competence
at headquarters. Down the line, however, among. the Junior
staff otecers, there is need of many morÂ© division encamp
ments.
all the Individual Instruction he need3. unless he heeds not
what Is going on around him. He^can learn to look out for
himself within his own limits, learn to shoot straight and to
leaving planning to those above him.
When Last's brigade, coming home from Its practice
march, appeared over the hill the call to arms was sounded
and within twenty minutes .the camp was guarded and out
posts were patrolling the country from a mile and a half to
two miles out. General Dickinson placed his men with a skill
and quickness that won comdliinent3 for him from the regular
officers who were attached to -the camp. In that hour of the
morning was one of the drills, for which camps are formed,
and the instruction of the individual soldier .was of secondary
importance while it was going on.
If the wild assertions of sensational journals' are
to be accepted the staid and "highly respected old
town, of Philadelphia can give the other cities of the
Union up-to-date lessons arid a little' more on muni
cipal corruption and official 'dishonesty, in everything
affecting the public welfare. -Perhaps the old town is
tired of being considered behind vthe times.
The death of the wife of President McKinley's Sec
retary of the Treasury and that of the son of his Secre
tary of State make his official family share the com
mon lot and universal fate.
When the attention is fixed upon such a group. as
a President and his Cabinet the havoc made among
all by the incidents of mortality is more plainly real
ized than when man is contemplated in the mass. In
Mr. Cleveland's first administration Secretary of State*
Bayard lost a loved daughter, Vice President Hen
dricks died, and a member of Attorney General Gar
land^ family passed away. Secretary Lamar did not
long survive his advancement to the Supreme bench.
In General Harrison's administration sorrow invaded
the White House in the death of" Mrs. Harrison, and
Blaine passed from the State Department to his grave.
Â¦And in Cleveland's second Cabinet Secretary of State
Gresham died.
Our people, who so recently .met the "bereaved
father, and admired him so sincerely, offer their con
dolence in an effusion of unaffected feeling..
Himself associated witlf the highest tragedy in our
national history, as the official confidant of Mr. Lin
coln in the Civil .Wary the Secretary was gratified by
the quality shown by this son,' who is dead untimely.
Mistakes might have been forgiven to his youth,
but he made none, and when his service was
over, with a sobriety of mind not often found at his
age he treated as a matter of course that he should
have done his duty, as that was expected of him. His
father is a man of peculiar goodness and simplicity of
life and manner, devoted to his family and of the
most lovable personal traits. This son was like all
his children, dear, and he felt great pride in the fault
less and honorable manner in which he had carried a
great responsibility.
.. How false and mistaken it all was is now history.
He reached his post and served his country with the
greatest activity, intelligence and wisdom. It is riot
easy to please a people under such awful stress as
w.ere the Boers. But he accomplished that delicate
and difficult task, and when the city of his post sur
rendered came home with the good will and praise
of all with whom his official duty brought him in con
tact, and at last with the praise of his own countrymen.
The young man -was sent to represent his country
as Consul to the Boer republic, and many there were
who delighted in deriding the appointment and in
predicting his failure to impartially represent our in
terests in that storm center of the world. He was ac
cused of pro-English sympathies, and a storm of
abuse followed his departure to duty that was fiercer
than the equinoctial gales that buffeted his ship.
THE whole country in a general and sincere way,
and his many friends in a very special and per
sonal way, will genuinely sympathize with Sec
retary. Hay in the tragic death of his very promising
son. . , .

Spencer & Raker, attorneys for A. C.
Colburn, a resident of Modoc County, who
gave . damaging testimony before the
Grand Jury In regard to the recent lynch
ing at Lookout, and who was placed In
confinement last Tuesday when it was
discovered that he intended to leave the
locality, filed a petition for a writ of ha
beas corpus in the Supreme Court yester
day.
â¢ Colburn knows a great deal about the
crime at Lookout, and was forced to tes
tify a week or more ago. His evidence
was ' of a highly damaging nature to the
accused parties, and he was warned that
any delay in that section of the State
might.cost him his life.
Colburn immediately settled up his af
fairs and was on the eve of departure
Â¦when his arrest was effected by Superior
Judge Harrington and District Attorney
Bonner. It is claimed by his attorneys
that his detention is illegal, and his im
mediate liberation is demanded.

Francisco. They have thousands of let

certainty that, work as 'hard as they can,
they will never get all of the epistles into
the mails Tor which they are intended. It
is. not their fault, but the fault of the
merchants who delay until the last min

crease of the mail the trouble has been
aggravated constantly and the Post
master, found It necessary to administer
the rebuke contained in the foregoing ex

old-time Democrat, saw in the striking: ex-
sociation, summoned the members of the
guild to attention. He made several an
nouncements of plans for future entertain

pressed his thanks to The San Francisco
Call for the great pleasure affo/ded by the
excursion. Sentiments of appreciation ex
pressed by Mr. Rountree were applauded
by the ladies and gentlemen of the party.
He called upon Hugh M. Burke to speak
for The Call, and the latter responded.
After the response S. G. Wolf addressed
the throng, Fpeaklng of the interesting In
cidents of the outing and the wonderful
attractions of California. Mr. Rountree,
perceiving that Uncle George T. Bromley
is loved by everybody, introduced him to
the audience, and In a happy and charac
teristic manner the celebrated High Priest
of Bohemia started a current of laughter
on the water front. The Alabamans were
quick to catch the original features of the

the editors and their friends from Ala

and good fellowship ever present when
newspaper men meet newspaper men and
sit down to enjoy a pipe and a bowl to

The assembly hall had been rigged in
its prettiest for the occasion. Across the
stage hung- the word "Alabama" in let
ters of white. Above it was a shield bear-
Ing ' the crest of Alabama, and on each
side -was looped up' bunting of red and
white, its folds caught in bunches of pink
roses and a confusion of green. From
the center of the hall hung bunting of
red, white and blue, with streamers of
red radiating over the ceiling and ending
in electric lights, and pendent from these
were big bunches of ferns. Around the
centerpiece was set a square of Japanese
lanterns. Brilliantly hued and swinging
restlessly they colored the decorations
overhead like the turn of a kaleidoscope.
At the molding above each window a
shield flashed brightly from a nest* of
green, and from below it sprang great
green brakes "out and up among the
lights twinkling on the ceiling. Bunting
of red and white was looped along the
walls. More clusters of green branches
studded with roses like points of dull Are

Split nair, harsh hair, lusterless hair,
brittle hair, falling hair, all owe their
origin to dandruff, which Is caused by a
measly little microbe that burrows Into
the scalp, throwing up the cuticle into
dandruff scales and sapping the vitality of
the hair at the root, causing the several
diseased conditions of the hair till it fin-
ally falls out. Modern science has discov-
ered a remedy to destroy the dandruff mi-
crobe, which is combined in Newbro's

. News from the spring wheat sections Is as
suming a more cheerful tone and there Is rea
son to expect a full yield of spring wheat. The
total of both winter and spring wheat should
exceed all records with a production of 700.000,000
bushels or more. .
NEW YORK, June 27.â Correspondents of R.
G. Dun & Co. report conditions of winter wheat
on the whole exceptionally encouraging. In
the principal States the yield will be very heavy
and It Is noticed that the rew unfavorable re
turns are from points -where only a. moderate
crop in expected. Figures of acreage Indicate
that the total area under cultivation this year
is smaller than In 1900, but the yield, per acre
will average much higher. Â¦

NEW YORK. Jun* 27. â There waÂ« quit* a
lively spilling out of stocks for a time to-day
sf a result of the suspension of the Seventh
National Bank, one of the members of the
Ckarins-house Association-, Jh consequence of
action by the Comptroller of thÂ« Currency,
iiut the market at no time approached any
where near to demoralisation. The drop In
prices was, howevÂ«r, very general and ex
tended to over S point's ta a number of the
principal active stocks which have been re
cent Javorites in the speculation. St. Paul,
I'nicn Pacific and Manhattan were the severest
pufferere and Missouri Pacific and Texas and
Pacific also yielded rather easily. The latter
part of the day. howwer, witnessed a striking
an<\ general recovery, which practically wiped
oat the earlier losses and established consid
<;aMe gains fcr some leading stocks. Union
Pacific. St. Paul Â¦.Â«<} Metropolitan Street Rail
v.-jiy were the only etoclcs among -the leaders
\vh:ch failed to benefit fully from this, late
recuperation in the market. The bears were
:.n active factor during the selling movement
<vA thÂ»ir buying to cover had considerable to
<".ri uith the late rally. There was an opinion'
i>rrva.lÂ«nt that rorae of the late financial in
terests were quietly Â¦ taking advantage of the
low level of prices to pick up stocks, without
making any attemp to Eupport prices. But
this opinion is hardly consistent with the gin
. Cfrly manner in which prices were bid up after
the- selling pressure had relaxed, with a palp
able disinclination to secure stocks. The sell-
Ing, for London account, which was supposed
to originate in Berlin, was aÂ» factor of con
siderable importance, which was probably not
sufficiently .allowed for in current estimates
of the market. The reports of further banking
troubles in. Berlin did not seem to have any
striking effect on sentiment here. The suspen
sion of the Seventh National Bank came as a
surprise, as it 'was generally supposed' that
friends of the bank would supply sufficient re
sources to carry it*through. The worst effects
of the embarrassment had been discounted on
Tuesday, during the period of suspicious con
jecture, when rumors were rife of far-extended
banking clifficulties. The disclosures since
made of the bank's affairs and of the charac
ter of the securities which had Involved it in
its difficulties served to give come confidence
thnt the trouble was localized, as these securi
ties were not dealt in on the exchange and
are not widely distributed. The Incident was
found, nevertheless, to create an unpleasant
Impression and serve^j to Intensify the pinch
in the money market incident to jhe turn of
the half year.
There was considerable shifting of loans,
partly in preparation for next week's dividend
disbursement and partly on account of throw.
!ng out of* unsatisfactory collateral for call
loons. The call ican rate ran up to 15 per
rent. With this substantial recuperation In
prices of standard securities since . the Â¦ May
panic the fact has rather been lost sight of
that euch a period of speculative confidence
and inflation as culminated then is bound to
leave its residue of doubtful securities which
might be easily marketable in a period 'of ex
pansive confidence, but would be a drug on the
market in quieter times. The market closed
very dull but firm at the recovery. There was
tsomt selling of railroad bonds in sympathy
withVtocks. Total sales, par value, $2,025,000.
I.'nited States bonds were all unchanged on
the last ralL

Chicago was very strong and advanced ma
terially under, better foreign advices. Local
shorts and St. Louis bought, and there was
more disposition to buy all around. Minneap
olis expected a decrease of 500.000 bushels for
the week. The Cincinnati Price Current says
that the threshinsr reports of winter wheat are
meeting or exceeding- expectations, and that the
quality is exceptionally high. Broomhall cabled
an advance in England on the strength of the
Berlin market, and the oversold condition of the
English markets.

WASHINGTON, June 27.â The attention
of the Navy Department has been formal
ly called to what appears to be an unsat
isfactory condition of affairs in Guam.
The incoming- mail^has brought a copy of
an order Issued by the naval commandant
of the island. Commander Beaton Schroed
er. denouncing "hoodlumism and lawless
ness." which' ht says are rampant at-the
station. The order refers to "terrorism
at the fort, gambling and drunkenness,
which have brought the United States
force into disrepute."
The order clot.es with .the imposition of
restrictions on the liberty of the marines.
It is believed the Navy Department will
be obliged to look into the denunciation
of the marines. General. Hey wood, com
mandant of marines, already has been
callc-d upon- to furnish such information
as he has, and it may be that a court of
inquiry will be appointed. The mall
brought him no report from Major H. K.
White, the ranking marine officer on the
island, nor. from any other source, con
cerning the reported troubles. He is very
much surprised at the extraordinary ecope
of Commander Schroeder's order, reflect
ing as it does upon the integrity of every
officer and man of the marine corps on
duty in the island. . . - ,

I President Horace G. Burt of the
I Union Pacific arrived from
JJL Omaha, in his private car yester
day afternoon. He looked the typ
ical railroad president sitting in his car
as the train rolled Into the Oakland mole,
fanning himself and poring over charts
and maps that were laid out on a table 1
in front of him.
What is President Burt out here for?
He said yesterday that he was just tour
ing the coast for pleasure and that he
might go to Los Angeles to visit his sis
ter, who resides there. The railroad men
around the yellow building, however,
claim that this visit is a result of the
Harriman interests controlling the South
ern and Union Pacific, and that this is
the first of many consultations that will
be held between Presidents Hays and
Burt with a view to bringing the
roads Into closer affiliation. Hays and
Burt met in conference in Chicago about
two weeks ago, and it is presumed that
the arrival of Burt in San Francisco
means that they will talk over certain
matters that lack of time prevented dis
cussing at their last meeting.
President Burt would not talk about
railroad affairs. In fact, he said that he
only knew that J. C. Stubbs had been ap
pointed traffic director of his road through
the newspapers, and that he had not yet
received an official circular announcing
the appointment.

fhall also be allowed an extra vote if he
is the father cf a family or If he pays
more than a certain amount of taxes, or
if he has a degree. In this way one man
could have four votes, and it is claimed
this would have a tendency to change

DIES FAR FROM
KLONDIKE HOME
OAKLAND, Juiie 27.â "We, the jury in
the above entitled cause, find the defend
ant, W. A. Brandes, guilty of manslaugh
ter and recommend him to the mercy of
the court. . H. E. MOSHER, Foreman." v
William A. Brandes, once sentenced to
life imprisonment for the murder of his
daughter Lillian, smiled when he heard
the foregoing verdict ..read In Judge Og
den's court this noon. The decision of the*
twelve men who heard the evidence at
the. second trial of the child slayer was
a palpable- compromise. " Eight jurors had
voted for a verdict of murder, either in
the first degree or in the second degree.
One hard-headed juror had declared the
accused parent ought to be burned at the
stake, but after nearly twenty hours of
deliberation in the jury' room two men,
Thomas Agnew and W. H. Rogers, with
the assistance of Henry Hauschildt, a
Redwood Canyon farmer, turned the ver
dict into one of manslaughter, with the
rider of recommendation to mercy.
Brandes. is more than satisfied with the
result of this trial. In spite of his declar-'
atlons that he believed he , should have
been acquitted, the man was. overjoyed,
and he displayed his gratification in every
move.
Attorney A. L. Frick. who defended
Brandes, was content. He had very little
comment to make. , .
"From a- professional point of view I
consider the verdict, a decided victory, 1 '
he said, "but, of course, from the stand
of the defendant it is not." ..
"Hauschildt wanted some more instruc
tions from the court this morning, but
when he found Judge i Ogden could not
give them until late this af tern ion he de
cided to vote for provided
the recommendations to mercy, were
added." Â¦ Â¦ â¢
The crime for which Branded has been
twice convicted was the killing of Lil
lian A. Brandes at Berkeley in Novem
ber, 1898. Her body was found hanging to
a bedpost, with external evidence of sui
cide, which the law officers have always
contended was arranged by Brandes and
his wife to cover the murder. The. body
of the child when taken in charge by the
Coroner was found covered with bruises,
plain evidence of brutality. An autopsy,
conducted by Dr. S. H. Buteau and seven
surgeon' assistants, disclosed the entire
absence of any trace of stmngulation,
but, on the other hand, sufficient brain in
jury from blows was uncovered to war
rant the opinion that the girl had been
foully handled. Immediately after these
disclosures Brandes and his wife, Mrs.
Etta Brandes, were arrested. She was
the dead child's stepmother. After a long
trial Bxandes was convicted of murder in
the second degree, but Mrs. Brandes was
discharged. The defense fought their case
out on a battle of opinion between medi
cal experts, the theory being held to that
the girl had actually killed herself. .. â¢ '
That line was utterly abandoned at the
trial just concluded. Attorney Frick prac
tically admitted that the child had been
murdered, but that Mrs. Brandes and not
his client was responsible for her death.
The Brandes' son Milton testified at much
length about a fight between his mother
and his stepsister. His narrative was in
tended to convince the jury that Mrs.
Brandes had struck the girl with a piece
of hose to prevent the child from assault
ing her with a knife.
By other means all the effort of the de
fense was centered. in an attempt to fix
the blame upon the woman who had once
beÂ«n" accused, but nevev was'prosecuted,
either as a principal or as an accessory to
the death of the girl. Now Brandes' law?
yer* contends that Mrs. Â¦ Brandes- is be
yond the pale of the law, having been
discharged at the first trial.
Brandes was granted a new. trial by
the Supreme Court upon the same ground
that won Mrs. Botkln and Murderer Hoff
of San â¢ Francisco another- trial; namely,
error of the Judge In giving certain in
structions concerning circumstantial . ev
idence. Â¦
Brandes said to-day: â¢ "I feel : that 'I
should have been acquitted. At any rate,.
I am going to try to free myself. I shall
make a fight for a new trial."

Wife of Farmer Is Fatally
Burned While Trying
to Save Papers.
TOPEKA, Kans., June 27.-Horribly
burned and dying in intense agony, was
the fate of Mrs. W. C. Carlson, wife of
a Cowley County farmer, because her
husband refused to deposit $5000 in a place
named by unknown blackmailers. Three
weeks ago Carlson, who is wealthy, re
ceived an anonymous note requesting
him to bury $5000 at the foot of a certain
telephone pole, under penalty of having
his house- burned. The suggestion was
ignored. One week later another anony
mous note was received stating that If
$5000 was not deposited within a week hi3
house would be burned and he would be
killed. No attention was paid to these
communications and on Saturday night,
while Carlson was en route to Medford
for mail the home was fired. Mrs. Carl
son was found about ten feet from the
ruins by Mr. Dunn, a neighbor, horribly
burned and insensible. She was taken
home by Dunn, where she rallied enough
before dying Sunday to relate the trans
action. She rushed outside when she dis
covered the fire, but returned for some
papers and a treasured old violin and
tried to save them. From that moment
her mind was a blank until she awoka in
the home of Dunn.

It was feared that confusion would re
sult if so many thousand visitors should
attempt to register at headquarters dur
ing the two or three days previous to the
convention, and so far as possible the
work will be done on the trains before
they reach this city.
The canvassers for subscription funds
have collected nearly half of the $25,000
which is required, and it is expected that
the rest will soon be on hand.
"Dr. Filben. chairman of the general
committee, states that no difficulties are
being encountered in any branch, and
that all arrangements are progressing to
the satisfaction of those concerned.
Dr. Kingsbury, in charge of registra
tion, states that all members of Christian
Endeavor, Baptist Young- People's Union
and other societies of similar purpose will
be . entitled to all the privileges of the
convention. Delegates who register will
be supplied with the league badge, which
will give access to all meetings. Regis
tration will be by cards, which will be so
arranged that the convention address of
any delegate can be readily given. A
fipecial postofflce has been ararnged for,
and mail will be delivered to registered
visitors daily.
Special arrangements have been made
with the railroads and transfer companies
so that baggage will be handled carefully
and expeditiously. Every visitor who
gives notice of his coming: will be pro
vided with Quarters on satisfactory
terms. Guides and an information bu
reau will be at the disposal of all who
may wish to avail themselves of them. It
is a matter of the deepest concern to the
committees that no difficulties shall be
met by those who attend the convention
and no effort will be spared to Insure the
satisfaction of the visitors.
The plans for the reception and enter*
tainment of the many thousands of dele
gates who will come to this city for the
Epworth League Convention" arÂ© now
practically complete. The committees In
charge of the affair have profited from
their experience with the Christian En
deavor convention In 1897, and all the dif
ficulties and inconveniences which at
tended that event will be obviated.

EPWDRTH LEAGUE
PLANS COMPLETE
Thflu order was included in a circular
sent to the principals and teachers under
date. of March 21, 1901. It has all the au
thority of a positive order, and violation
of Its provisions will entail the same pen
alties as violations of orders of the board.
Despite the order complaints are' being:
made that the practice is still in vogue
in several of the schools. It is claimed
by parents that no true account can be
kept of the scholarship of a child if he
or she is to be lined credits won by a
knowledge of the course of study when
ever a lapse in deportment occurs. It is
claimed that the markings for ability and
the markings for deportment should be
separate, as the Superintendent has or
dered, and that if it be necessary to estab
lish a standard in deportment it should
be done by a system that does not en
croach on the pupil's ability to learn.
If the practice continues another circu
lar, and a stronger one, will be issued
which will deal with the subject.
I am authorized by the Board of Education
to state that no credits assigned for scholarship
should be deducted - from the record of a pupil
on account of poor deportment. Deportment
records and scholarship records must be kept
distinct and separate.
It Is some time since Superintendent of
Schools R. H." Webster ordered that In no
case should a teacher deduct' from the
scholarship of a pupil because of poor de
portment. It is an old custom, or it was
until the order was issued, ' that in ad
ditions to "checks" for bad behavior, a
teacher would deduct, "credits," or mark
one or three or live "failures" against the
obstreperous one, whether he failed in his
lessons or had them perfectly.
The injustice of the system was always
apparent, but It was not until â¢ the mat
ter was brought to the. attention of the
Superintendent by the parent of one of the
pupils that the following order was is
sued: : â¢ -
Be Abolished.

Dr. C. D. Balflcld will apply for a writ
of injunction to-day to prevent the Board
of Public Works, the Board of Education
and Xewsom & McNeil, contractors, from
proceeding with the work of improve
ments to the Dudley Stone School. The
contract was recently let for the erection
of a third story to the building at a cost
of J7979.
Associated with Dr. Salfield as plaintiffs
Jn thÂ« case will be J. P. Klncaid. W. B.
Hunt. H. Templcman and Mrs. Annie
Martin, residents in the vicinity of the
school.
The injunction will be applied for on
the ground that section C3, or No. 2927. of
the sreneral orders of the Board of Su
pervisors, limiting the height of frame
buildings to fifty-five feet is violated in
the contract, and that no ordinance grant
ing a special privilege was passed. The
further ground will be urged that the ad
jacent property will be injured in value by
the proposed improvement.
Taxpayers who are opposed to the
building of a third story on this primary
school claim that the building would be
come unsafe for young children. Thev
say further that the play gTOund is now
inadequate for the children, and that a
new site should be secured in a portion of
the district where children are now com
pelled to go too great a distance to reach
the. Dudley Stone School.
The Board of Education held a special
meeting yesterday and adopted plans for
the addition of two new stories to the
Buena Vista School. Commissioner Man
son of the Board- of Public "Works said
that the cost of the improvement will be
$11,000. The interior and exterior of the
structure are to be finished in the same
manner and of the same material and de-
EigT> as the present building. The board
also adopted plans for improvements to
the- Fremont School at an estimated cost
of â¢$1650.
The salary demands of the deputy
school superintendents were ordered paid.

ThÂ» next step Cn order in tha orfanlia-
The meeting then proceeded to the adop
tion of the by-laws for the new organiza
tion. Inasmuch as all the members had
been supplied with copies and had read
them carefully, it was moved by A. Ger
berding that the reading be dispensed
with. General Thomas Clunla objected to
this method of procedure, the- matter be
ing somewhat important, and the secre
tary was Instructed to read the pamphlet,
the mernberB to follow him and make any
objections they might consider well taken
after the reading.
Secretary Friedlander had got aa far
as the fourth section, when General Clunie
discovered that he was the only man pres
ent who had not familiarized himself with
the by-lawa, and he arose to withdraw his
objection, Further reading was then dis
pensed with, and after. an objection to
the clause allowing the board of dlreatora
to spend money for purposes of the adÂ»
vancement of the trade of the city had
been made and voted down, the hy*lawa
as a whole were adopted, They are rieÂ»

The by-laws had been prepared for some
days in advance by a committee appointed
for that purpose, and the charter mem
bers had been furnished with printed cop
ies. The meeting was called to order by
George W. McNear, president of the pro
visional organization, who stated very
briefly tho objects of tho gathering.. Tho
first business was the naming of a com
mittee of three to nominate a ticket to
be voted for at the election to be held on
July 16 to choose a permanent board of
directors for the new exchange.
On motion of E. B. Pond, the chairman
was directed, to name a nominating com
mittee of three, with the recommendation
that it nominate as directors the sixteen

NEW EXCHANGE
ADOPTS LAWS
San Francisco Is peculiarly situated in the
theatrical way. It costs money to bring
the best attractions out here and then a
constant change of faces is demanded, so
that in engaging people we can only offer
them a short season. But now we are so
placed that we will be able to offer long
engagements and at the same time keep
bringing out new people. Then another
thing. Take the scenic features, in an
elaborate production like 'Uncle Tom's
Cabin.' They entail a heavy outlay as
things now stand. With our chain of
theaters all can be shipped on to the other
houses and with very little expense. made
to serve in the production at them. At
Alcazar Theaters on the same lines as w<
have in the past.
"People want amusements and the
atrical entertainments at popular prices
and we have succeeded now In reaching a
position where we will be able to glvt
them the very latest and best in the
dramatic line at popular prices. We havt
also concluded arrangements with some
of the very best players In the country,
and you may rest assured that our firm
will hold no second place as purveyors ol
amusements."
Mr. Belasco says i the complete details
of the new arangement will be made
known soon. .
the Central Theater we have ample room
for the executive 'offices, painthouses
and supply warerooms, so that we can
prepare, equip and rehearse the organiza
tions sent out to the other theaters.
'"Robert Downing will be director gen
eral- of the productions put on at all the
theaters in our circuit, and will supervise
and organize the road companies which
will be sent out bv us. He Is a master in
such lines and that he has consented to
assume this trust Is an assurance that
our productions and people will be of the
very highest class. We have acquired
rights to the very best plays extant and

"Don't imagine for an instant," said
Mr. Belasco, "that we have formed â¢ a
