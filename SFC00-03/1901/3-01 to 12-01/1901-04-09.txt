It is believed that the departure of the
troops, will cause Cubans to feel that they
are not held in, check by artillery' and
rifles. The President has been told that
It would" have a good effect upon the en
tire political situation In Cuba and result

Outside of politics no fault is found
with General. Wood's administration \;in
Cuba. He is believed to be a very good
executive officer. It is not thought that,
even if the army is withdrawn, any
change will be made with reference to
General Wood, but the proposition to get
the troops out of Cuba is being very
carefully considered. .
It Is felt here that General Wood has,
failed to grasp the signification of events.
He has not; been in touch with the con
stitutional convention at all. He reported
to the President and the War Department"
that the constitutional convenion would
surely accept the Platt amendment, and
the final rejection of the amendment on
Saturday came to the â¢ President . as a
shock and overthrew General Wood as a
prophet.
Wood Not a Good Prophet.
General Wood has - since been appoint
ed brigadier general in the regular army
and it is admitted in many quarters that
while he has been an improvement over
General Brooke in a few respects, he has
fallen far short of General Brooke as a
diplomat. Tho administration, while "ex
pressing great â¢ confidence in General
Wood, is beginning to realize that he has
lost the confidence of a very considerable
portion of the Cuban public and has failed
to realize the trend of public sentiment.
General Leonard "Wood, Governor of
Cuba, is likely to resist such a step.- The
President has been told for two years that
one of the greatest causes of friction be
tween Cubans and Americans has been
the military government, yet the army
has. been adverse to letting go and -the
army has had its way. Â¦-'.--. .Â¦ *..
Cubans realized when' the : Americans
took control that they had merely
changed Spanish military rule for Amer

consider the great difference between the
methods of Spain' and the United States.

the required speed."

WASHINGTON, April 8.â Secretary
Long was informed to-day that the tor
pedo boat Perry, built by the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco, failed to meet
contract speed requirements on her recent
official trial. Under the contract the ves
sel was required lo develop a speed of 29
knots an hour, but the best she could do
on her trial run was 28.2 per hour. The
failure to xrake the full speed required.
2a knots, will not result in the rejection
of the ship, as the contract provides a
penalty for deficiency in speed between
29 and 2S knots. The boat will therefore
be accepted, the price being $259,000 in
stead of the full contract price of $263,000.

Peaches were damaged some, as were
pears and grapes. It is apparent that
while individuals have suffered serious

FRESNO, April 8.â The local , weather
forecaster predicts a heavy frost for to
morrow morning, the first hard one th'.s
season. There have been three or four
plight frosts, but the damage has not be^n
great either to vines or deciduous or cit
rus fruits. Apricots and almond blossoms
undoubtedly have been nipped in scattered
and exposed places, but this will be bene
ficial in saving thinning out hereafter.
Crop conditions are most satisfactory,
though rain is much needed for grain.
There has been a large increase In vire
acreage In tftie county, footing 4000 or 5000

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio. April 8.â Dr. C.
W. Wooldrldge, a well-known Ohio scien
tist, came out to-day in advocacy of a
unique project. He would create a glacier
at the top of the San Bernardino Mount
ains, in California, that would change the
arid lands of Arizona and Southern Cali
fornia into a fertile garden. He would
have the standing army now used to de
stroy employed to Improve, and suggests
as one of its tasks that it erect an Im
mense chimney on the Pacific Coast, of
an enormous height, so that the ocean air
could be carried to the top â¢ of the
San Bernardino Mountains, where by at
mospheric action It would be reduced to
an extremely low temperature, thus form
ing, according to Wooldridge, an Immense
glacier. ;
The presence of this glacier, he says,
would cause a sufficiency of rainfall,
w/iicn in that country is now lacking be
cause the upper stratum of atmosphere Is
too warm. He also suggested electric dy
namos which would furnish power to till

wculd be irrigated by underground water

have, trolley tracks so that the farm

ed issue of corporate stock for property
and the issue for monej^ Justice Dlxon
finds, lies not in the rule for valuation,
tut in the fact that different estimates
may be formed of the value of the prop
erty. WhÂ«n such differences are brought
before a judicial tribunal Justice Dixon.
says the judgment of those upon whom
the determining of the value 19 placed,
must be accorded considerable weight,
but it la not final.
Question of Overvaluation.
"Nor is it necessary." the opinion says,
"that conscious overvaluation or any
one form of fraudulent conduct on the
part of these primary values should bo
shown to justify judicial Interposition.
Their honest judgment, if reached with
out examination into the elements of
value or if used in part upon an estimate
of matters which really are not proper
or. if plainly warped by self-interest, may
lead to violation of the statutory rule .as
surelv as would corrupt motive. The or
iginal issue of corporate stock Is a spe
cial function. In the exercise of which
the Legislature has fixed the standard l<\
be observed, and It 13* the duty of thÂ«
courts, -so far as their Jurisdiction ex
tends, to see tiiat this standard is not
violated either intentionally or uninten
tionally."
Justice Dlxon points out that under
section 40, when corporate stock has once
been issued for property purchased, the>
Legislature has directed the application of
another rule. Under such conditions noth
ing but actual fraud In the transaction,
can Impair the right of the stockholder to
hold his stock as full paid stock, free
from further call.
Applying the rule 83 above laid down.
Justice Dixon discusses the actual value
of the property, the purchase of which
was contemplated by the issue of $45,000.
000 of stock. He finds it admitted that the
value of the Guggenheim plant as physi
cal possessions did not exceed $10,000,000.
and with the cash to have been turned
over, leaving about $23,000,000 to be made
up in the good will of the business and
the leases and contracts, the nature of
which was not disclosed at any time in
the proceedings. While the defendants
claimed the complainants had not borne
the burden of proof cast upon them. Jus
tice Dixon holds that under these cir
cumstances this rule should not be vigor
ously enforced at this stage.
Conclusions of the Justice.
The proofs. Justice Dlxon says, point
strongly to the conclusion that in the ne
Â¦ gotiations between the parties the real
value of the property to be acquired had
not been the basis upon which they have
determined the amount of stock to be is
sued therefor. The fact that the expected,
consummation ' of the deal caused the
market value of the stock to rise, and
which was used as an argument that the
proposed purchase would not be advan
tageous to the stockholders. Justice Dlxon
finds to be without weight. Me says that
if the intrinsic value of the stock was
only 60 per cent of its face, and an out
sider offered 80 per cent in money for ad
ditional stock to be issued, such an offer
would clearly be advantageous to the
I company and its stockholders, but it could
! not be legallv accepted, because the Legis
lature has required that 100 per cent,
whether in cash or property, shall be re
ceived for corporate stock.
The court finds that the mere fact that
two-thirds of the directors and stock
holders voted for the purchase can not
prevent its review,- pointing otit that this
would not justify â¢ an issue of stock for
an illegitimate enterprise.
In accordance with these views the court
orders that the stay be continued enjoin
ing the purchase and that proceedings to
increase-the stock should likewise remain,
in statjl quo pending further argument
-and a -decision by the Court of Chancery
as to the real value of the Guggenheim
property. .-;.*,:.;

There -was $22,000 in revenue stamps re
quired for the stock certificates and al
most half that amount to stamp the deeds.
JusticecDixon at Trenton, N. J., to-day
filed an opinion of the Court of Errors and
Appeals in the case brought by minority
stockholders of the American Smelting
and Refining Company to .enjoin the pur
chase, of the property of "M. Guggenheim
& Sons. This opinion has been awaited
with great interest by corporation law-r
yers, as it is considered most important as
affecting corporations In New Jersey.
â¢ -. Title Importance of the opinion lies In the
construction placed by the court on sec
tions 48 and 49 of the general corporations
act. Vice Chancellor Stevens held that the
court could not go beyond the decision of
the board of directors as to the value of
the property to be purchased by the issu
ing of stock. The Court of Errors, on the
contrary, holds that it must be clearly
shown that the value of such property is
at least reasonably near the price to be
paid, and the action of the directors is
subject to review at the instance of any
stockholder who considers himself ag
grieved. Tlje syllabus of Justice Dlxon
follows: : â¢ â¢
Text of the Decision.
Under section 40 of our corporation act when
an original issue of corporate stock for prop
erty to be purchased Is contemplated it is the
duty of the directors to see that the real value
cf the property is at least equal to the face
value -of the stock. Before an original 'ssue
of corporate stock for property to be purchased
takes place the bona fide Judgment of the di
iectors a3 to the value of the property, while
It Is entitled to considerable weight, is not
conclusive, but may' be . reviewed - at the In
stance of existing stockholders, and If on such
review by a court of equity the -value of the
property appears to be less than the face value
of. the stock the issue should be restrained.
After ' stock ; has Â¦ been Issued as fully paid
stock for property purchased the judgment of
the directors as to the value of the property
becomes conclusive In the absence of actual
fraud in the transaction, and such stock is
not liable to any further call. An increase of
corporate stock, voted for by the board of di
rectors and by the requisite majority of stock-*
holders in order to Issue such stock for prop
erty worth less than the face value of the
stock, should be restrained at the instance of
dissenting stockholders.
In .considering the right of the court to
review the action of the directors, Justice
Dlxon says the language of section 4S of
the corporation act is not questionable
as to the fact that the money paid in must
equal the face value- of the stock issued..
The language of section 49 is even more
explicit, providing thaf the corporation
may Issue stock to the : amount of the
value of the stock. ;
The distinction between the contemplat-
sion. The decision of the Supreme Court
was.that "the decree of the Circuit Court
of Appeals should be reversed, with costs
and the case remanded to the Circuit
Court with Instructions -to set aside It3
decree adjudging that the order of the
commission be enforced and to dismiss
the application made for that purpose,
with costs, the whole to be without preju
dice to the right of the commission to
proceed upon the evidence already intro
duced before it upon such further plead
ings and evidence as it may allow to be
made or introduced, to hear and determine
the matter In controversy accordlns to
In the cases of the Clyde Steamship
Company the decrees of the Circuit Court
of Appeals and of the Circuit Court were
modified by providing that "the dismissal
of the bills shall be without prejudice to
the right of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, if It so elects to make an
original investigation of the questions con

so modified the decrees were affirmed.

War Casualties Are Figured as High
as Fifty Thousand.
"WASHINGTON. April 8.â The rebellion
against American authority has been a
costly experience for the natives of the
Philippines. Fifty thousand Filipinos
form the lowest estimate of the War De
partment of casualties sustained by thÂ©
Filipino forces; 7667 rifles have been cap
tured or surrendered and 605,142 rounds of
ammunition, as shown by incomplete re
turns, have been seized. The number of
Filipinos killed cannot be accurately de
termined by the department, as General
MacArthur in his dispatches states that
It is Impossible â to be accurate on this
point, but it would not surprise officials
shculd losses sustained by the insurgents
in killed and deaths from disease reach
25,000, and some say that 50,000 is closer to
the real figure. .
The rebellion in the Philippines has been
In progress for three years. In his annual
report for HS99 Major General Otis, then
in command of the archipelago, said that
"Aguinaldo's concentrated army was. var
iously estimated at from 20,000 to : 30,000
men. Officials of -the War Department
now admit that while this estimate may
have been true of the army proper, it is
certainly not true of the strength of -the
Filipino forces throughout the insurrec
tion, as the disaffection resulting from
Aguinaldo's efforts and his impressment
of natives caused large additions to . his
command.
Adjutant General Corbin is satisfied that
tho casualties suffered by the Filipinos
will in themselves form a potent reason
for the abandonment of further resistance
by the natives. The progress made in
pacification Is illustrated by the figures
in - possession of the department. For
twenty-seven months, ending November
30 last, the total number of Filipinos
captured or surrendered was 13.4G8 officers
and men. and the number of rifles turned
in 4933. Since November last 6600 officers
and men have been captured or surrend
ered, and 2734 rifles have been delivered
to or captured bjÂ»the American troops.

court by United States Senator Thomas

how to steal the election.

DECIDES AGAINST
FRUIT COMBINE
â¢ *
Judge Seawell's Ruling May
Cause Disruption of
Association.
Sustains Defendant's Demurrer in an
the Terms of a Con
. tract
Action Brought to Enforce
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 8.-Judpe James M.
Seawell of San Francisco, who recently
heard the suit of the California Cured
Kruit Association against W. Ainswori.li
to compel the latter to deliver to the asso
ciation $700 worth of dried prunes, has
rendered a decision that may affect all of
the association's contracts /with prune
men. At present there are nearly 100
Fimllar suits pending throughout the
State. The opinion of Judge Seawell ap
plies to three cases he recently heard
here, against Ainsworth, F. E. Stelling
and the Phoenix Raisin Seeding and
Packing Company. The local Judges were
disqualified because of being interested.
The decision sustains the demurrer filed
by XV. Ainsworth to the suit of the asso
ciation. The defendant disposed of his
fruit to the Phoenix Dried Fruit Company.
Judge Seawell practically decides that the
association Is entitled to only 2 per cent
of the prunes contracted for. the amount
il was to be given for handling the fruit.
The court holds that there is no allega
tion in the complaint that plaintiff has
sustained damages by reaton of the con
version of the prunes therein mentioned,
or of the amount of euch damages. The
averment that the value of the prunes at
the time of the alleged conversion was
5700 is not the equivalent of an allegation
that the plaintiff has sustained damages
in that amount.-
Overvaluation of Damage.
The amo unt of damages sustained by
plaintiff, by reason of the conversion
complained of, is not necessarily equal to
the value of the prunes. By the action
of the defendants the plaintiff has been
relieved of the labor and expense incident
to the inspection, packing, storage, insur
ance and sale of the prunes, and the obli
gation to account for the price realized
by their sale.
Continuing the court holds:
I flo not think that the provision that upon
failure of Ainsworth to deliver the prunes as
soon as picked and cured plaintiff should be
entitled to assume and take exclusive posses
s'on and control thereof has any greater effect
in conferring title on plaintiff than the prom
ire of Ainsworth to deliver them. Neither was
the agreement to deliver the prunes absolute.
>insworth agreed to cure the prunes to the
satisfaction of plaintiff's inspector, and there
uiwn to deliver the whole thereof to plaintiff.
There is no allegation in the complaint that
the prunes were cured to the satisfaction of
TilalntifTs inspector or were ever inspected by
h-ra. If Ainsworth intended a transfer of the
prunes why was the sale and transfer in terms
limited to 2 per cent? By the contract alleged
l:e sold and transferred 2 per cent absolutely
fir.d merely agreed at a future time and upon
a certain contingency to deliver the whole of
the prunes.
My conclusion is that under the facts 6tated
in the complaint the plaintiff is not entitled
to maintain the action. I cannot take judicial
i.otice of the fact, if it exists, that plaintiff
l:as made a like contract with other fruit
growers, nor do I know judicially the pur
jm- ses fof which plaintiff was org-anized.
It is fair to assume that plaintiff's ability
to carry on its business depends upon the
lidelity with which the persons who contract
with "it carry out their engagements. The
Feme is true of all business undertakings.
Tl'at is, however, a circumstance of no ma
teriality in the construction of the agreement
eel forth in the complaint.
The effect of the decision may be wide
spread and will be watched by the prune
men. The Cured Fruit Association prob
ablv will amend the complaint and make
a hard legal fight. If the decision filed
to-day was to stand, all the dissatisfied
irrowers in the association would break
away.
Directors Decide to Appeal.
The directors of the California Cured
Fruit Association and their attorneys held
a meeting this afternoon and discussed
the results of Judge Seawell's decision.
They were unanimous that the case must
be fought to the bitter end, as the life
of the association depended upon it. An
appeal will be taken to the Supreme
Court.
President Bond said this evening that
the significance of the decision was that
the present contract vrould not hold good
unless the prunes are cut of the growers'
hands and into the warehouse of the as
sociation. While it did not affect the pree
r>nt crop, it would have a destructive ef
fect on next vear's operations and might
disrupt the association. It is the first de
cision ever rendered on the contract used
by most of the co-operative associations.
The Cured Fruit Association's contract
is the same as that of the Raisin Grow
ers' Association, and it will affect that
organization, which now has a similar
Btxu pending. The directors of the asso
ciation and its attorneys are of the opin
ion it will not be sustained. Steps will
be taken to obtain a decision before the
June meeting of the association. If Judge
Seawell should be sustained it means all
contracts with prune men for next year
â¢will be worthless and practically a re
organization of the association must be
had.

"Then, again, I know that, outside of

RICH PLACER STRIKE
MADE BY PROSPECTORS
Men Rushine'In to Stake Out Claims
TEKOA', April 8.â There is intense ex
citement here over the discovery of rich
placer diggings on Santa Creek, about
twenty miles east of here, in Idaho. Men
left here at all hours last night to stake
claims. Others are rushing in from Parm
ington and other points -In the Palouse.
The discovery was mode by the Tysons
brothers, three farmers, in a gulch which
runs-.into Santa Creek, about eight miles
from the creek's confluence with the St.
Mary. From a. piece of ground 40 by 15
feet they took out $308 in coarse gold.
Their appliances were crude and it is
estimated that, they got less than a third
of the gold, as the -bedrock was not
cleaned at all. The new camp is on the
divide between the old Hoodoo District
and the Coeur d' Alen.es. It is said several
million dollars was taken out of the old
Hoodoo district In early days.
The wreckers sought to derail the heavy
train, with its scores of passengers, and
ditch it in the river, fifty feet below the
track bed. Had they succeeded awful loss
of life would have resulted. A discarded
tie had been placed across the rails, to
which It was bound by ropes, at the north
end of tunnel 5. A few feet? beyond the
obstruction a bridge spans the river for
the support of the track.
Luckily the engineer saw the tie when
his engine was still In the tunnel and
stopped his train within a few feet of the
obstruction that might have hurled more
than 100 persons to their death in the
river. * . .

seven furlong run, won by Astor, the
odds-on choice. The Jatter came home gal
loping, with the tardy arriving Cromwell
beaten a nose for the place by Homage,

get closer to the leader during the earlier

the manifesto which Aguinaldo has been

Oscar Gardner, who is to box Terry Me-
Govern before the National Athletic Club
on the 30th of this month, began training
at Croll's Gardens, Alameda, yesterday,
under the direction of Joe Bernstein.'
Gardner and Bernstein will box and wres
tle and do plenty of road work. Oscar is
confident that he can defeat McGovem.
He claims he was cheated out of a victory
when he met McGovem in New York a
year ago. He said he knocked Terry down
in the first round with a left hook and
the Brooklyn wonder remained down four
teen seconds. Gardner says that when h<?
knocked McGovem off his feet he : was
close to the ropes and in order. to give
McGovem a chance to rise :to his 'feet he
stepped over his prostrate body. - McGbv
ern grabbed his leg and held on until his
brain cleared. Gardner says he was so
disgusted at the treatment accorded him
that he lost all heart and McGovem haJ
no troubl-e putting him away' in three
rounds. Following are the measurements'
c-: the two men taken at the time of their
memorable battle:

is he that Toby will reach the top that

accepts Joe Bernstein's challenge in- lie
half of Irwin and will match his man

Pago Pago, Samoa, so that she may not
be looked for until this morning. Many of
the passengers booked for her came up on

STEAMSHIP MATES ON STRIKE
Trouble on the Vessels of the Hawaii-
an Interisland Fleet.
AVhen the China left Honolulu on the 2d
inst. nearly all the vessels of the Inter
island Steamship Company and the
"Wilder Steamship Company were tied up
for want of officers. The> first, second and
third mates of the two fleets asked for an
advance, in pay, and when the demand
was refused they went out on strike. Men
to till thfir places were advertised for, but
ihe supply of licensed officers Is very lim
ited in the islands, so the steamships had
to tie up.
Before Hawaii became part of the Union
p. mnster mariner did not require a license
to navigate among tho islands. When an
nexation was accomplished and the laws
of the United States ruled all masters and
tnates of steamships had to pass an exam
ination and be licensed by the inspectors
of steam vessels. This threw many men
out of employirent, and sailors with cer
tificates from San Francisco* took their
places. These men now want coast wages.
n;id judging from the news brought by
the China, they are going to get them.
Disinastrd Bark Identified.
The four-masted bark sighted by the
schooner Rosamond is still causing under
writers worry. Every vessel now due on
Hie coast lias been canvassed, and the con
sensus of opinion is that the disabled boat
will probably turn out to be the German
Â¦four-masted bark Willy Rickmers, now
<>ut forty-live days from- Kobe. Japan, for
Portland. She is in ballast and painted
lilack. and so rills the bill as far as it goes.
It will be remembered that the British
bark Willscott was dismasted also while
on her way from Japan to Portland and
put in here under a jury rig.
Otto Gildermeister Again.
The men who gambled on the overdue
Otto Gildcrraeister are not feeling as jubi
lant as tli^y did a month ago, when the
partially dismasted vessel was towed into
Sun Dirgo. There is some talk of her be
ing condemned as a "constructive loss,"
and should this be done the gamblers may
loso their money. The bark is worth about
SKn.<tiyt. and it will cost in the neighborhood
off J-J.n/HXt to repair and refit her. The own
<-rs therefore rray elect to throw the ves
sel on the hands of the underwriters, and
in that event the gamblers may lose.
There is' not more than SD003 involved on
ilio Paeific Coast, and as the reinsurers
have made some big prollts of late they
can nffurd to lose a few dollars now.

Will Seek to Prevent Removal of Em

9 Â¦ Â¦
The' Board of Civil Service Commissior
ers decided last night to protect in.tho^r
positions all employes other than depu
ties, who have been appointed from, the
eligible lists to places in the so-called
county, offices. : This action was taken
after the board's special attorney, Garret
McEnerney, had advised that the decision
of the Supreme Court overruling thj
merit system in the offices mentioned ap
plied to deputies alone. ,' \ '. .
â¢ This decision of the commission mea.is
that the. copyists in the -Recorder's and
County Clerk's offices and the bookkeep
ers and clerks in the 'offices of the Sheriff,
Assessor and Coroner and for the Jus
tice's Clerk ,are regarded as being undbi*
the jurisdiction qf the Civil Service Com
mission. At the meeting of the commis
sion last night no special plan of proced
ure was outlined to bring the matter t;i
an issue. It was agreed, .however, that
should any city officer attempt to remove
a civil service employe other than a dep
uty, except for good and sufficient caus-%
the aid of the courts .would be invoked
to prevent the removal. The action would
probably take the form of a writ of man
damus to ' restrain the appointing powt
from removing such employe until the
status of. the deputies is determined.
President "Freud of the Civil Service
Commission is of the opinion, and in this
he Is backed by Attorney McEnerney,
that it will be no trouble to prove who are
deputies and who are not. The charter
itself provides the number of deputies and
their compensation in each of the offices
affected. Freud says that a deputy is
one who acts for his principal and is com
petent tto administer oaths or signs docu
ments for his superior. â¢ .
The determination of the disputed point
will result in the holding of examinations
for positions outside of deputies in tne
county offices. The commission claims
that the only issue before Judge â¢ Heb
bard was the attempt to -restrain tli2
holding of examinations for deputies. The
opinion affirming the decision of the lower
court is devoted wholly to deputies and
for that reason it is claimed that the
commission has not been enjoined from
holding -examinations lor all other posi
tions. - .:
The commission further decided to go
ahead with the examinations in the mu
nicipal offices not affected by the Supreme
Court decision, beginning with the Boards !
of Works. and Health. The positions in !
the first-named board have all been classi
fied and the first examination will be
held on Thursday, April 25, for offleo
deputies. This will be followed as rapidly
as possible by examinations for superin
tendent of public buildings, superintend
ent of stone pavements, superintendent of
sewers, civil engineers, plumbers, med
sengers, janitors, hydrantmen, stenogra
phers, inspector of light and water, drafts
men, watchmen and other -positions, in
all, 100 examinations will be held. The
commission will endeavor to secure boards
of examiners for each' one, the members
of these boards to serve gratuitously.
It is figured that there are 2000 positions
still subject to the provisions of civil
service, .notwithstanding the Supreme
Court decision. Assessor Dodge states
that he will submit to civil service, -a 1 -
tnough his office is exempted therefrom,
so far as his deputies are. concerned. I--.
was stated that, the copyists will petition
the Supreme Court for a rehearing in or
der to establish their status." It is prob
able, however,; that nothing will be done
in: this connection until, as stated, some
appointing power proceeds to remove a
civil service subordinate.
WORRIED OVER DECISION
OF THE SUPREME COURT
Copyists in Various Departments at
City Hall Anxious as to
Future Action.
The copyists at the City Hall are d2
cidedly uneasy over the recent decision
of the Supreme Court in regard to the
civil service. . "* ' Â¦
If, as is contended, these employes are
no longer to be appointed under the civil
service act, some of them may lose their
positions, hence the anxiety. About forty
civil service appointees are affected by
the decision, and most of them are em
ployed in the County Clerk's and County
Recorder's offces. . .
Neither County Clerk Deane nor Record
er Godchaux are decided as to exactly
what course they will pursue, but several
new men are to be hired in the office of
the latter, and Godchaux states that they
will be copyists whom he will himself
select.
Mr. Godchaux says that his experience
with civil service aupolntees In the past
has not always been pleasant, and that
inefficient employes have been placed in
his office.

An imperial spectacle IsEmile Berger
afs "More Than Queen," as presented by
Miss Blanche Walsh and her company last
night at the Columbia Theater. "More
Than Queen" is rather a series of splendid
pictures than a play proper, a gallery of
the brilliant scenes in which the Jose
phine episode in the life of the Man of
Destiny played themselves . out, and con
sidered as this, ,. it is a royally sufficient
effort. The prologue shows' the meeting
of the lovely 'Creole; Josephine Beauhar
nals, and Napoleon In the srarden of tha
Palais Royal, an admirably beautiful pic
ture. The first act takes place . at the
Chanterine residence of the Bonaparte3,
in 1799. Napoleon has gust returned from
Egypt and discovers Josephine about to
attend one of the masked balls so much
in vogue during the. period. The threads
of the plot, such plot as there is. here
begin to discover I themselves. Josephine
is childless, it is the wish of the First.
Consul to become an Emperor, and it is
necessary for the stability of the empire
that there be an heir to the throne. There,
is only one' way for the Emperor to take,
to divorce the faithful woman who has
been all to him but the mother of his
children, and it is the story of the sacri
fice of the Empress that is told by M.
Bergerat:
Napoleon has announced his return from
Egypt to the Bonaparte sisters, not to
his wife. She discovers this and attends
the ball on the evening of his return.
He, misled by lying reports from his in
terested relatives, believes. her faithless
She returns from the ball, and in an ex
quisitely dainty scene compels the sulky
general to capitulate.
The- garden of Malmaison, favorite
home of Josephine, Is the scene of the
second act and shows the coming -of 'the
envoys to the First Consul with the offer
of imperial honors. The third act, scene
first, takes place in the palace of the
Tuileries, showing the events of the morn
ing of the coronation of Napoleon and
the jealousy of the Bonaparte sisters of
the new-made Empress. The second
scene is the coronation in the Church of
Notre Dame, and is a picture that for
magnificence has seldom been equaled on
the local stage. 'Act IV opens â¢ in the
Palace of St. Cloud and is the one dram
atic scene in the play. The Palace of
Fontainebleau, in the last act, shows the
resignation of the Empress to the will of
her husband in the signing of the divorce.
Orpheum.
' As the Empress, Miss Walsh adds much
to her worthy reputation. Gracious, arch,
queenly, tender, womanly, she makes all
there i3 to be made of the part. Her
gowns are splendid and beautiful, she
looks the Empress every inch and won the
audience at once with her work. She is
well â fairly well â supported. Napoleon is
essayed by William Humphrey, at first
apparently rather a lightweight repre
sentative of the Corslcan genius.- He
warmed up to his work later in the even
ing, however, and in the big fourth act he
became for the time the vain and splendid
Man of Destiny. Talleyrand, the "most
good-natured man that ever cut a throat,"
is played in a guileless fashion by Ogden
Stevens. Lucien Bonaparte is well done
by Robert Lowe, and the part of Roustan,
the Mameluke, affords Frank Sheridan
opportunity for a brilliant bit of dramatic
recital that begins the good things in the
one good act of the play. Elizabeth May
hew and Helen Singer 'take good care of
the parts of the wicked sisters, and the
rest of the cast is acceptably filled.
"More Than Queen" is worth the money
for the settings alone. Buhl cabinets,
tapestry, carvings, pictures, all historical
ly correct and exquisitely artistic; out
door scenes of rare beauty and costumes
of admirable taste and splendor, all leave
an impression oÂ£ unusual beauty. The play
will remain for two weeks at the Colum
bia. . \
The splendid bill presented by the Or
pheum. management last night made a de
cided hit with the big audience. The Pre
vosts do an acrobatic turn that keeps
the spectators gasping with wonder.
Josephine Gassman is as clever as ever,
and scored an instantaneous hit with her
pickaninnies, who are .wonderfully cute
and amusing. The droll stories of Wood,
the monologist, reached every -one and hn
was given an enthusiastic welcome.
Stephens, in his imitations of Joseoh Jef
ferson. Henry Irving and other" great
footlight stars, showed great ability, an.l
is a feature of the bill. "The Girl of
Quality," Hamilton Hill and Tschernoff
and his dogs, holdovers, were warmly
greeted, and the great American biograph
was as popular as ever, j
Tivoli.
The "standing-room-only" sign of la.?t
season is once again displayed at the
popular home of comic opera and crowds
are flocking to the Tivoli to witness the
delightful revival of "The Idol's Eye" i:i
all its wealth of music and scenic effects
Needless to say that Ferris Hartman and
Alf C. Wheelan are as amusing as ever,
while Cunning-ham, the new barytone, had
leaped into instant favor. Maud Williams,
Annie Meyers, Bernice Holmes and Ed
ward Webb make up an unrivaled cast.
As for the chorus, the young ladies are
beautiful, to look upon and know how to
sing. The orchestra is en rapport with
th3 singers and the entire production is
so pleasing. that a chancre r.t programmo
is not to be looked for for some weeks.
Alcazar.
"Tennessee's Pardner" commenced its
secondand last week at the Alcazar
Theater last night before a crowded
house. There were several, curtain calls
and the applause was unstinted. Frank
Bacon's portrayal of the part of Gewilll
ker Hay is one of the features of the play.
The singing by the New Century quartet
of "The Days pf '49" was warmly ap
plauded. There should be large audiences
during the best of the week.
Central.
â¢ "Ingomar," as Marie Lovell paints him,
is a barbarian of the mountains with an
inherited love of freedom and his neigh
bor's goodsâ a rough, bass-voiced, fearles3
leader of men as brave and as fearless aa
he. So Robert" Downing, 'rough, bass
voiced and forestian in virility, paints him
on the mimic stage of the Central Thea
ter. Â¦ The scoffing humor of the uncul
tured nomad, who found in weakness and
tears subject for laughter, who lived on
stolen cattle and the booty of the boM
foray, yet who became a willing slave
to* a pretty woman's smile and who re
pelled with hot indignation the offer to
heap honors upon him and to give him the
girl he loved as the reward for the pro
posed betrayal of his comrades in arms
and robbery, is faithfully and consistently
portrayed by Mr. Downing in the beauti
ful play. Strength is his predominating
â¢characteristic and strength of -voice .Â¦ami
movement without apparent effort.'. WhilÂ»
differing in method, and perhaps lacking
in the subtle dramatic discrimination that
made Edwin Forrest great, Mr. Downing
follows closely, in the wake of the sten
torian, tragedian in the role of Ingomar.
He is ably supported by Lorena Atwood^
who portrays the character of Parthenla
in an unexpectedly artistic way. .
: Robert Cummings as Alastor fulfilled
the expectation of the public, who had
seen his performance in the "Gladiator "
The play is well staged and costumed and
will run the remainder of the week to full
houses. â¢ ;,
Chutes.
.' The Chutes -has a varied and entertain
ing bill. Scott, and "Wilson appear,- In '.- a
clever acrobatic act. Coakley and Hues
ted present a laughable sketch, intro
ducing some artistic dancing. " Miss .Mir
lan Ainsworth makes some wonderful
changes -without leaving the stage. The
holdovers are Professor Barnes'- Dog and
Pony Show, and Al and Mamie Anderson
in. their, latest novelty, the Chinese and
the Coon. -A' series of. new moving- pic
tures are also shown.

work in order to live â
The story is just the same j all suffer from about the
same cause, and in this suffering "peculiar to women," all
reach the same level, and all are of the same family. |
When' a woman is nervous and irritable, head and back 1
ache, feels tired all the time, loses sleep and appetite, has I
pains in groins, bearing-down sensation, whites and irregu- I
laxities, she is not " worn out/' but feels as if she were. c |
â¢> Such symptoms tell her that a womb trouble is imminent, I
and she cannot act too promptly if she values her future B
comfort and happiness. . |
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted 1
women of America go to prove, beyond a question, that Ly dia I
E. Pinkham'3 Vegetable Compound will correct all such I
trouble at. once by removing the cause and restoring the 0
organs to a healthy and normal condition. If in doubt, write |

Mr. Abbott is quoted as saying: "To my personal
knowledge, last year, when there were five Porto
Rican Judges on the bench and a case was pending
It happens, however, that we have information upon
that phase of government in the island from another
source. The New" York Post recently published &n
account of the Porto Rican courts given by W. T.I
Abbott, who is described as a lawyer of eight years'
standing, and who" for eighteen months has been a
resident of Porto Rico. According to that statement
the insular courts are ignorant arid corrupt, and the
Judges, "decide entirely in the interest of the party
who brings most influence to bear either in money or
otherwise."
Concerning the fitness of the native office-holders
the Governor does not. say much. That would seem
to be a subject which the Governor thinks should not
be discussed just now. The islanders are not used to
American methods 'of procedure and will have to
learn. We must not expect too much at the start.
Concerning the Government itself the Governor
sayp the administration has desired and has sought to
obtain the co-operaticn of all good citizens. It is
required of those who aspire' to insular offices that
they "be loyal to the American Government, and that
fitness for office with such loyalty be the fundamental
requirement rather than the indorsement of some
political leader."
â¢-Â» OVERNOR ALLEN of Porto Rico, who has
f "~i just gone to Washington for the purpose of
' consulting with the President, gives a good ac
count of affairs in the island and describes the condi
tions of the people as most promising. They appear,
to have made marked progress, not only in the various
lines, of industry, -but in those of civil government;
and the prospects are that we shall not have any seri
ous problems to deal with in governing the country.
It is, of course, to be expected that the Governor
would make a favorable report of what has been. done
urder his own. direction, and something must be
allowed for the inevitable bias in the mind of a Gov
ernor speaking of the results of his own work. When
such allowance has been made, however, there remains
enough in the Governor's statement to justify the
hopeful view he takes of the situation. He is able to
say: "The civil government established in Porto Rico
is working smoothly. The various departments have
been organized and our administration is seemingly
giving general satisfaction. In a material way thers
has been wonderful progress. Most of the land hot
under cultivation under the old regime has been taken
up and made profitable. * * * In the old estab
lished industries there has been great improvement
in all except coffee growing and production."
PROGRESS IN PORTO RICO.
If it were possible to institute some proceeding
compelling this corporation to return this money to
its customers, we would favor immediate action. But
:t seems there is no remedy for the wrong. The tax
shirker has the money, and its patrons who paid it can
whistle. However, another* time, when necessity for
stamp duties arises, Congress will be on its guard.
Yet these tax shirkers have deliberately refused to
bear their share of the burden of this war, and on the
contrary have employed tricky lawyers throughout the
cour.tr>' to utilize the processes of the courts in stand
ing off litigation designe.l to make them perform their
duty. . It is a safe estimate to say that Wells, Fargo &
Co. has profited in this State by its contumacious
ness to the extent of a quarter of a million dollars.
A meaner and more unpatriotic position was never
Uken by a grasping corporation than this. These
stamps were issued to pay for maintaining a war
against a foreign power, through which the United
States has acquired a vast area of territory, over which
in due time the express companies of the country will
extend their lines, and from which they will derive
revenue.
But the moral obligation of paying these stamp
taj.es still rests upon Wells, Fargo & Co. and the
ether unpatriotic corporations which united with it
after the passage of the law in open defiance of tlie
Government. It is estimated that in. this State alone
Wells, Fargo & Co. kns collected from its customers
between $8odb and $10,000 per month in stamp taxes.
Rates were not increased to cover this amount, jbut
the corporation insolently defied the law and refused
to perform its duty as a common carrier unless its
customers paid for the stamps.
So Justice of the Peace Birry and Superior Judge
Trcutt of this citj% Judge Tuley of Chicago, the Su
preme Court of Michigan and other tribunals and
judges who have passed upon this proposition all took

rerort in this State, the war revenue act of 189S im
poses the duty of stamping bitls of lading, receipts and
other contracts of carriage upon the express company

Capital seeking investment, the induce
ment to engage in enterprises which will
meet wants in the home country, the de
sire to settle their emigrants where neith
er their labor nor their allegiance will be
lost to the fatherlandâ these are the eco
nomic and social grounds on which may
be explained the desire of the Germans
to colonize; where such, economic, and so
cial relationships are established it Is but
a step to political control, and the politi
cal control of colonies by. Germany has
been striven after not only for the sake
of protecting economic and - social inter
ests but also for the sake of world pres
tige. Â¦ JOHN E. GEORGE.
Noteâ Next - Tuesday will be published
a paper by Dr. George on "Germany's Co
lonial Policy." .
The bearing of this great change upon
the subject of German colonization is two
fold. In the first place, her manufactures
have progressed so rapidly that Germany
is not only able to supply her own needs
in a great many lines but is obliged to
go out into the world to seek new mar
kets. German savings, too, have increased
her capital until It no longer finds suffi
cient employment at home, and is seek
ing investment in new fields. In the
second place, the agricultural produce of
the country no longer suffices to support
Its ever-increasing populationâ a fact
which can better -be appreciated Â¦ if we
Imagine 80 per cent of our own popula
tion compressed within the one State of
Texas and there forced to earn a living,
for Germany is not as. large even as Texas
would be minus the area of the State of
Illinois, while her population is fast ap
proaching the 60,000,000 mark.
Foodstuffs Wanter; Goods to Sell.
A direct result of this change has been
a great increase In population, notwith
standing the continued heavy drain
through emigration, for a nation which
has developed industries as well as agri
culture is capable of sustaining a larger
population than a purely agricultural na
tion. During the quarter century from
1S25 to 1S60 the increase In population was
considerably less than 7.000.000, while dur
ing the quarter century from 1870 to 1S93
the increase was from. 40.S16.000 to 52,247.
000. or nearly 11,500,000, and that, too, in
fact of the fact that during these years
the country lost more heavily through
emigration than in any other period of its
history. That this increase in population
is directly connected with the growth of
tha great manufacturing Industries may
be seen from the changed ratio of rural
to urban population. From 1S71 to 1S90
there was an actual decrease of nearly
35.000 in the number of people in the agri
cultural districts, while in the same pe
riod the population in the cities and towns
increased" nearly 8,500,000. In 1S95 only 38
per cent of the population were engaged
In agriculture, while 39 per cent were en
gaged in the great industries of the cities
and in mining and 11 per cent In com
merce and transportation.
The political change brought about by
the establishment of the empire was an
other stride in advance. It had to do not
only with. the relations of the German
states among themselves but also the pro
motion in a political way of the commer
cial interests of the united people and the
continued allegiance to the f aCtherland of
the thousands of emigrants who: were
leaving and settling, in distant countries:
During the fifty years from 1820 to 1870
The Tide of Emigration.
With the founding of the empire Ger
many broke with the past and entered
politically and economically upon a new
era. These political and economic
changes, together with the emigration
from Germany of large numbers of her
people, are the prime factors in her pres
ent colonial policy. The political change
bi ought about by the founding of the em
pire was in some respects the comple
ment of the change brought about forty
years earlier by the establishment of the
Commercial League (zollverein). This
league broke down tariffs and other bar
riers? to trade which had existed from
time immemorial between the various
German states, and prepared the way for
the great industrial changes of more re
cent date. It established free trade
ai- ong- 26,000,000 Germansâ the first great
step toward national unity. By creating
a . community of interests on commercial
and trading questions it prepared the way
for political unity; by overcoming local
prejudice and habit It created a stronger
feeling of German nationality. Â¦

sclia . empire. There had been frequent
attempts at colonization by. German ad
venturers during earlier periods. Ger
man settlements existed on the coast or
Africa more than 200 years ago.Â« Still ear
lior. ships from BrandenbwrK found their
way to the west coast of Africa In quest

together with the Prussian company of
Emden, finally managed at the close of
the seventeenth centuhy to establish a
foothold on the Gold Coast. As early as
16S1 the Brandenburg merchants had -or
ganised for purposes of trade in Africa
the Brandenburg African Company, but
by 1720, distracted by quarrels at home,
it had abandoned its West African enter
prise. Â¦ Asain, in the early *40s of the
fast century, Germany gave some consid
eration to the question of colonization,
this time to the unoccupied territories In
America. From 1S60 to 1S65 her attention
was again turned to Africa, when ft Han
overian baron. Von der Decken, was ex
plcrlng the East African coast. It oc
curred to him that Zanzibar and the ad
jacent mainland would be a good field for
German colonization and enterprise, es
pecially as the opening of the Suez canal
would soon shorten the route to those re
gions. His idea'was acted upon, and the
work begun by him was carried; on by
Hamburg merchants, who established a
nourishing trade at Zanzibar.
This measure is so much of an innovation upon
existing methods of vutirig in this country that its
passage is not likely; but it has had the effect of rous
ing a good deal of discussion on the subject, and in
the end something â irsy be done to put an end to
minority rule. It appears that in New York, at. any
rale, the' "third party" has become a political nuisance.
A still more curious proposal in the way of abolish
ing old customs is before the New Yorkers. There has
been introduced into the State Senate a bill entitled,
"An act to diminish the loss^of votes on third party
candidates and to promote election by majority." The
bill provides for permitting the voter to specify a
second, choice on his billot, so that if the first choice
be defeated the second choice will count. :Â¦ It is argued,
by way of example, that when the good citizens of
New York city were divided in their votes between
Seth Low and General Tracy, thus permitting the
Tammany candidate to become elected by a minority
of the people, they would have been able to elect either
Low or Tracy had they been permitted to indicate
their second choice. %
The bill is regarded cs a virtual abolition of capital
punishment, because it is believed a jury would never,
except in very atrocious cases, recommend the death
penalty, and a Judge would h'ardly set aside a solemn
expression of a jury in favor of the lighter punishment.
The enactment of the measure would thus by indirec
tion accomplish nearly. a)l that the opponents of cap
ital punishment desire. Strangely enough, the matter
lias not attracted much attention. The bill was passed
in the Assembly by a vote of 94 to 26, and we learn
from our New York exchanges that the passage came
as a surprise to the public, as few people were aware
that any such measure was under consideration.
Another bill affecting punishment for crime passed
the New York Assembly some days ago and is re
ported to have a fair chance of enactment. The meas
ure has been described as a bill to abolish capital pun
ishment. It provides that murder in the first degree
shall be punishable by death or by imprisonment for
life, and murder in the second degree by imprisonment
for life or for a term of not less than thirty years, and
the jury in every case is required to accompany its
verdict with a recommendation to the court stating its
preference as to the alternative penalties, the final
choice between them resting with the trial Judge.
It is said one of the effects of the law will be the
release under parole of the notorious Younger broth
ers, whose criminal exploits were once the sensation
of the time and are not yet wholly forgotten. The
Youngers have been in prison'for twenty-four years,
and, with the allowance of one-third time for good
conduct, which they h?ve under the Minnesota law,
and which they are said to have earned, they are now
.entitled to parole.
The Minnesota Legislature has virtually- abolished
life-imprisonment by; the enactment of a parole prison
law, which provides: "No convict who is serving
under life sentence shall be paroled until he shall have
ser.ved under such sentence thirty-five years, less the
diminution which he would have been allowed by law
for good conduct had he been sentenced fo^ a. term of
thirty-five years."
I N addition to their distinguished efforts in the way
I cf enacting new reforms by statute, several of the
* Eastern Legislatures have ma'de notable efforts at
re form, not by making more laws, but by abolishing
or amending old ones. Some of these efforts are de
serving of general attention. We . may not care to
follow the exainple set in the East, but it will be inter
esting, at least, to note what the Solons of that section
are doing.
ABOLISHING OLD LAWS
The modern movement for colonization
in Germany has taken place entirely
within the last quarter of .the century
just past, and is a result, to a very large
extmt, of the unification in 1871 of the
various independent German states into a
Early Colonization by Germans.
Of the fourteen' nations controlling the
colonies, protectorates and dependencies
of the world, Germany stands third as
regards the area of the territory subject
to her control, and fourth as regards
population. In both respects Great Brit
ain leads, the total area of her posses
sions of this character being . 11,187,000
square miles, and their population J 356,
781,000. France comes next with an'area
of 3,304,000 square miles and a total pop
ulation of 50,372,000. Third in .respect to
population come the colonies of tho Neth
eilands, with 31,717,000 in an area of but
630,000 square miles; while Germany's col
onies and spheres of . Influence comprise
an area of 1,025,000 square miles and a
population of over 11,000,000. But, while
Germany stands, third as regards area
and fourth as regards population, it must
not be forgotten that she was the last
to enter the field of colonization, having
gained political control of all her colonial
possessions since 1884.
'I^ut in the meantime there have been
other considerations bearing in the same
direction. During the last quarter cen
tury there has been going on in Germany
an industrial revolution not unlike the In
dustrial revolution which took place in
England at an earlier period: from beins
chiefly an agricultural nation with small
Industries Germany has been becoming:
more and more a manufacturing nation.
Germany's Industrial Revolution.
The great mass of these people came to
the United States, though considerable
numbers went to Australia, South "Amer
ica and the Cat>e. This great movement
of population from Germany was a heavy
loss from a national point of view. More
over,, in the ease of those who went to
English colonies, Germany- not only felt
the loss to herself but regarded tne gain
to England, her political and social rival,
with great jealousy. To find new terri
tory to which these emigrants could be
turned and to maintain in them a spirit
of nationality and allegiance to their na
tive land was the first great motive lead
ing to colonization. _v
it is estimated that about 3.500,000 persons
emigrated from Germany, while during
the comparatively short period of twenty
years, from 1S71 to 1S91â the period when
the new colonization movement was fast
taking holdâ nearly 2.000.000 of the popula
tion left to improve their- condition in
newer countries.

nage as applied to ships is found in the
same manner as register tonnage except
that measurements are made, not along

tent Is divided by S3. Displacement is the*
quantity of liquid which Id displaced by a
solid body placed In It. If the weight ot
the displacement Is greater than or equal
to that of the body, the latter will float.

the pressure of a liquid displaced Is suf
ficient to counterbalance Its weight.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Considering the whole subject it may be said Porto
Rico is in good condition, and is in a fair, way to
make rapid progress. Up to this time, therefore, we
have no reason to regret that we annexed the island,
nor have the islanders an> cause, for complaint against
the manner or the meaning of our Government.
over a valuable ' watc-powcr privilege, f it developed
that two of the five Judges had been retained as coun
sel on one side of the case and had given opinions,
and two on the other side, and under those circum
stances it is hot difficult to understand how the de
cision of the presiding Justice was to be given. Now,
that is not regarded in Porto Rico as anything out of
the way' It is According to custom which has'been
in daily practice there always."
Upon that showing it is clearly the duty , of the
United States to establish honest '! courts as soon as
possible. That appeals to be -the chief need of the
island just now. The. natives seen to be peaceable
enough. Governor Allen says: "Some disturbances
hnve occurred, but never with such serious results as
have often occurred in the United States barroom
brawls. Hooting and howling crowds on the streets,
a" few stones thrown, some rattling of sticks along
the palings have been sufficient 10 occasion sensa
tional cables, to the north, which, though promptly
denied, have been circulated to the discredit of the
island." '" IV^.1
The law of liberty, the universal statute of indepen
dence and self-government, is written in the hearts of
such people in Cuba. Such hearts have always been
the tablets which have borne its inscription. If we are
guing'to break faith and lie to the world in the Cuban
settlement, as we have been lied to either three years
ago or now, let us do it like bold buccaneers, declaring
that we propose to take the island and exploit it be
cause we want it in bur business, and disregard the
arpiration of the people for liberty. The pirate sleeps
sweeter over his spoil, rocked in the cradle of the
deep, than the hypocrite who sinks to rest after even
ing prayers.
It has been so always. The English revolution which
destroyed the royal prerogative was led by a brewer
and was fought out by :i Jot of psalm-singing cartmen.
Masinello was a Neapolitan fisherman, Schamyl was a
piountaineer, and Ypsilanti was a vine dresser.
The future deliverer of Russia will probably be the
grandson of a serf, and certainly not of a bayard.
try and allies of Great Britain.
The record of man's aspiration for liberty and inde
pendence is not the biography of "the best classes," as
now understood. American independence was aspired
to by Thomas Paine, the staymaker; Franklin, the
printer; Knox, "the stationer's clerk; Putnam, the
farmer, who plowed his stony fields with oxen and
cculd hardly write his name, and by John StarK,
a clodhopper; Nathan Hale, a poverty-smitten
teacher; Ethan Allen, a rude woodsman; and the plain
people endured and suffered for liberty, while the
best people who shared their lot could be counted on
the fingers. Those of culiure'and refinement, of wealth
aiid respectability, were Tories, enemies of their coun-
In behalf of our own countrymen and the national
honor, we protest against thisjiew installment of offi
cial information and views.
Turning to the Congiessional reports and speeches
of three years ago we find that the "wealth and cul
ture," the best and most respectable people of Cuba,
were therein denounced as sordid supporters of Spain,
while the rest of the people, now denounced as preda
tory riffraff, were gasping on the point of a spear and
dying for : liberty. Those who survived are now
denounced as being for independence merely to get
office, a motive that must be abhorrent to every Amer
ican politician.
A Democratic newspaper, which plays Jekyll and
Hyde with, the administration, admits that these Con
gressional views are in notable contrast to the Con-" 1
gressionar views of three ' years ago. The official
pilgrims then saw through their emotions and found
heroes, warriors and patriots. But the present "en
lightened and honorable members" find "the respect
able classes" desirous vi annexation and opposed to
independence, while the rest of the people are a lot of
predatory riffraff, who have none of the culture and
respectability of the island with them.
One of them says he doubts the safety, of capital in
Cuba, and he finds the best people do not want inde
pendence, and that those who do are hot the best peo
ple and are merely looking for office. Another says
the people are not fit nor ready for self-government.
Another distinguished Senator returns and hastens
to say that it is only a matter of time when the island
will be annexed, and that the present constitutional
convention is not a 1 epresentative body. The best
people want annexation, as do a vast majority of the-
American people. .'Â¦ Â¦ :,
Congress adjourned on March 4. In that brief time
parties of Congressmen have visited Porto Rico and
Cuba and have, returned wise in knowledge of ths
whole situation. *. ; ;
If the kind of information that is being furnished by
Congressmen now had been furnished then, there
would have, been no war, and if the kind we had then
were. furnished now, there would not be ahead of us
the prospect of more trouble. If the truth is told by
Congressmen now/the Congressmen then did not tell
the truth. ' .:
CONGRESSMEN ON CUBA.
ARE we not in danger of a slight surfeit of Con
gressional information and views about Cuba?
The country had a deal of the same sort before
the Spanish war. It was the means of drawing us into
thst enterprise and of launching us upon the sea of
troubles whereon we arc now drifting with no sails to
speak of, rudder gone, compass magnetized, and chro
nometer out of order.

KLING THRASHED -FOR
KICKING LUCY'S BOY
Interesting Fight Between a Saloon-
Keeper and Teamster Is De
scribed in' Court.
James Lucy, saloon-keeper c.t D-lo Bryant
street, appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday on a charge of battery. The
complaining witness was John Kling, ?i
teamster, living at 48s Eighth street.
After. hearing the evidence the Judge dis
missed the case.
It appeared that on March 29 Lucy's
boy Denis was playing around the stables
at Bryant and Chesley streets, wnere
Kling is employed. Kliug kicked the boy,
who in running away from him struck
his head against . a , .truck and nearly
knocked his right eye out. Two days later
Lucy went to the stables and asked for
the driver "of the grey team." Kling said
he was the man. "You are the man who
kicked my boy," said- Lucy, and pitched
into him. ' Kling had a curry Comb In hli
hand and cut Lucy several times on the
face with it, but he came out second best
in the encounter, as Lucy at one time was
classed as a leading lightweight pugilist.
Kling said: "He put it all over me."
The boy was in court and told the Judge
how Kling had kicked him, and how he
got the blow on the eye. The Judge
thought that Lucy could not be blamed
in the circumstances. . Â¦
Lucy's boy had sworn to a warrant for
Kling's arrest in Judge Fritz' court, but
when the case was called yesterday, Lucy
said he did not want to prosecute Kllngr,
as he was a workinerman, and he was
satisfied he had been taught a lesson he
would not forget. The case was dismlssed-

draped the walls of the dining-room and'
tiny silk banners were placed at intervals
on the board, adding much to the effect

At the plate of each^lady of the bridal
party was placed a heart-shaped red jew

Having spent the money accumulated
during two years' service in the army,
Paul Warren,' late a private In Troop C.
Eleventh Cavalry, went out to the Cliff
House yesterday afternoon and put a bul
let into his brain. Warren went into the
barroom of the resort and purchased a
drink of whisky. After drinking the liquor
he walked out on the balcony and stood
for a few moments looking seaward. He
returned to the barroom, bought and
drank another glass of liquor and re
marked-to A. CL Lester, the bartender,
that "it was a fine day."- He stood for a
few moments leaning over the bar and
then walked down to the lavatory in the
basement.
A few moments later a shot was heard.
The attendants rushed down the stairs
and found the lifeless body, of Warren in
a small room, with a bullet hole over his
right eye. Death had' evidently been in
stantaneous, i ' Â¦
The body was taken to the Morgue, and
a search of the clothing revealed an ex
cellent discharge from tne army. From it
it was learned that Warren wa^ from
Quincy, 111., 31 years of age and a stenog
rapher by occupation. He had been paid
$110 when mustered out. barkeeper Lester
of \ the Cliff stated that he had the ap
pearance of. a man who had been on a
protracted spree.

The Settlement of Many Questions of

t -
The bill amending the revenue laws, in
troduced into the Legislature early in the
last session and finally passed in a much
altered form, has just been received at
the Assessor's office.
Assessor Dodge, in speaking of the rad
ical changes which the bill will effect in
the affairs of his office, states that the
meet important innovation concerns, the
collection, by seizure and sale, of taxes
on personal property not secured by real
estate. This duty was formerly exercised
bv the Assessor and now devolves upon
the Tax Collector. ' ,
Another amendment makes it the duty
of each person to file a sworn statement
with the Assessor as to whether 01 not
he is the owner of any taxable property.
It also gives the Assessor the authority to
subpoena and examine any person witn
reference to property which j may be
stored with such persons The effect of
tnis amendment is to settle matters of lit
igation resulting from a question of the
Assessor's right to exact sworn state
ments from warehouse men, with refer
ence to goods stored in their buildings.
Taxable property, from. outside the coun
ty, but from within tne State, will be sub
ject to taxation in this city if found here
the first Monday in March. The Super
visors are given greater authority also in
the matter of refunding taxes collected
through duplicate or erroneous assess
ments. In the past this matter has
caused much difficulty through the inex
plicitness of ihe law. â
Another change has been effected to
provide for the cancellation of the sale
of a piece of property, made for the non
payment of an unlawfully assessed poll
tax or for one paid, but not properly
noted. An amendment which will afford
popular relief provides that a delinquent
Tax Collector must give fifteen days' no
tice of the commencement of a suit for
payment of additional taxes levied after
the equalization of the State roll, when
the previously assessed tax i has been
paia. In m*ny cases this amounts to a
few cents only and the people of the city
have been caused considerable annoyance
and expense through their Ignorance . of
any such additional tax until they were
sueO by the Collector for a sum much
greater than the original delinquency,
through the addition of penalties and
CCfctS. - Â¦ . . Â¦
. "The amendments and new provisions,"
says Assessor Dodge, "are, in my opinion,
all in the right direction and tend to fa
cilitate and make more certain the op
eration of the revenue laws than was pos
sible heretofore."
RELIEF PROMISED
BY NEW TAX BILL
Assessor Dodge Says Much
Is Gained, by the
Amendments.
JOTJXMIT GOING OUT
TO PAINT INDIANS
A Bally at the Bohemian Club to
Give the Artist a
Send-Off.
Amedee Joullin, well known In the Cali
fornia guild of picture painters, is pre
paring for another expedition to the home
of the red man. Two years ag:o he visited
the tribes of New Mexico and Arizona and
painted pictures that won the admiration
of artists. On the journey in view he will
first visit the tribes in Idaho and Mon
tana and then travel to the south. He
v.-'ll paint the noble buck, the Industrious
squaw and the picturesque papoose and
bring home with hn* trophies and skins
for the studio. Imcfflnation? which is .an
excellent quality of the true artist, will
supply what he fans to see.
A dinner, or little send-off, to Mr. Joul
lin was given at the Bohemian Club last
evening. Assembled at the table round
were: Frank Gelett Burgess, Porter Gar
rett. Edpar Matthews, Robert I. Aitken,
Fremont Older. James H. Graham, F. E.
Beck. W. F. Metson. W. D. English, Ry
land B. Wallace. Judge Henry A. Melvln,
Dr. A. Warner, Dr. Russell H. Cool. E. A.
Brugipre, George H. Malter, Charles G.
Yale. George T. Bromley. Hugh M. Burke
and A. Joullin.
At the annual election of the Bohemian
Ciub yesterday Frank P. Deering was
elected president, John Landers
vice president, Charles K. Field secre
tary and John Dempster McKee treas
urer. The following named directors for
the year were chosen: Charles J. Dick
rr.an, D. Ernest Melliss, Arthur W. Moore
and Wallace A. Sabin.
Vanderlynn Stow, the retiring president
of the club, has served the institution
â¢with remarkable fidelity and cuceess for
a period embracing two regular terms.
During his administration of affairs the
plans for acquiring a grove of noble red
wood trees were put into practical opera
tion and carried to a successful finish. Â¦
The Bohemian Club -was the first insti
tution in the State to fully estimate the
grandeur and beauty of the redwood for
ests. The agitation for reserving a grove
began with the Inauguration of the mid
summer high jinks in the woods twenty
years ago. The eloquence of General "W.
H. L. Barnes, Frank M. Ptxley, John F.
Swift, John H. Boalt and Horace G. Platt
induced many members to subscribe to
the sentiment of preservation, but it was
reserved for .Mr. Stow's administration to
find purchasers for the bonds. It is high
ly creditable to the Bohemian Club as an
organization that it has saved to Califor
nia one of the most beautiful and majestic
groves of the famous Russian River for
est. The example of the club in this en
terprise will surely speak to other socie
ties of public spirited men.
They Axe Credited With Having
Saved the Renowned Grove of
Bsdvoods on the Eussian â¢
River.
Compliments for Vanderlynn

NEW YORK. April S.â The call loan rate
proved again to be the solar plexus of the
Flock market, as it has done on many oc
casions before. The constriction of the money
supply and the advance in the rate for call
money precipitated such a spasm of liquida
tion as threw the stock market into a con
dition bordering on demoralization. What
happened to-day in the stock market Is what.
according to all observers, was bound toÂ» hap
pen in due course of time. Nevertheless, as
is the wont of stock market happenings, the
day's event came as a surprise. Even the
most enthusiastic bull has agreed to the prop
osition that such a rampant speculation ae
has been going on for weeks past was bound
to overdo itself and be followed by a relapse
of corresponding violence. Only the enthusi
astic bull has clung to the supposition that
the relapse was still remote and has continu
ally moved forward the supposed date of its
occurrence in the hope that there was time
for Mill another Fpet'ulative turn. Even the
wild and excited market of last week, which
â¢was an ominous symptom, left the bulls un
prepared for to-day's developments. Tips for
a rise i.i many stocks were still widely preva
lent before the opening this morning and the
explanation was offered that Thursday's flurry
in call loan rates was due to manipulation
by the bears. But the instant the market
opened It became evident that the develop
ments tince Thursday bad induced a wide
spread determination to sell stocks. Another
palpable fact was that some of the most pow
erful operators In the market had already sold
their holdings and taken profits during the
wild excitement of last week and were com
pactly organized on the bear side of the mar
ket this morning. Perceiving the "highly vul
nerable condition of the market owing to the
over-extension of long accounts thinly mar
ginsd and backed by weak resources, the
bears fell upon the market with great fierce
ness and cut a wide breach in prices at thÂ«
lirs-t onslaught. The- wide extent of the first
declines, v.hich were made by successive drops
from 1 to VA points between sales. Invited
quick profit-taking by the bears and the vio
iont rallies which ensued encouraged the bulls
to make 'some stand against the reduction,
Jioiung that the flurry was temporary and the
market prepared to renew the advance. This
was the only period of the day when there
was any show of positive strength, and Sugar
People s Gae, Texas and Pacific and a number
of less important stocks were marked ud
sharply over last Thursday's level.- The
strength was short lived, however, and after
the demand from the bears had been satisfied
tnany of the banks began calling loans. This
.^TYil ,*/!**Â« ""PP^ of liquidation In the
inarkrt and invited fresh attacks by the bears
The selling became precipitate as the fall in
rr.c-es wiped out margins and uncovered etop
ir, sa orders and the unlucky bulls Jettisoned
creat bales of stock with the hope of relieving
'mâ¢'~v C^ saving other holdings from the
Hhtpwm-.k. The only Important demand at anv
time came from the ehorts and the occasional

This was true of the laFt as of former rallies

CHICAGO. April 8. â For a moment at the
opening the Corn market resembled to a degree
the wildness which characterized the market
last week._ Seasonable weather and liberal re
ceipts caused a rush to sell at the start, and
May ranged from 44 to 43%c, }s@%c under Sat
urday's closing price. Greater weakness had
been expected, and when it failed to materialize
shorts covered and the market worked back to
44%@44%c. Profit-taking by country holders
caused a reaction to 43%@43%c The Wheat
strength caused a rally from this to 44%c, and
the close was firm, with May Va@%c higher at
44%@44%c. The volume of business was very
much less than recently. Phillips did but little.
Â¦ "Wheat was still feeling thn bearishness of
Snow's crop report at: the opening to-day. The
sentiment was further weakened by seasonable
weather, liberal receipts and an ! increase on
passage. Bears were active at the start, May
selling from 70% to. 70>4c. %@%c under the
previous close. A report that German Wheat
had suffered from frost and a similar rumor
from California started shorts covering. It de
veloped that the market had been sold to a
standstill. Very little Wheat was to be had,
and May, reacted sharply to 70%c. A visible
decrease of 859,000 bushels, lighter primary re
ceipts, heavy clearances and good export de
mand later Imparted additional strength, and
May rallied to 71V4c. Commission houses bold
on the advance, but the close was firm, with
May %c higher at 71',ic. It was reported later
that the California frosts had done little dam
age to grains. The Orange Judd Farmer re
ported that the 'condition ot winter Wheat Is
practically perfect in the centers of heavy pro
duction, the general average being 95.5. against
85.7 at the same date for me past seven years.
The market for Oats was dull. May closed a

the conditional offer of the Secretary of the

relief for tho stock market.

Mr. West was 72 years of age and well
known In Napa Valley: He was fairly
well-to-do, being the reputed owner of
several pieces of valuable land in Napa
County.
Police officers went in search of the ele
vator boy, but could not locate him. Xo
one about the building could give any in
formation regarding him except that he
had been employed in the building only a
day or two.
A hurried examination showed that Mr.
West was still alive, and he was hurried
to the Receiving Hospital in an ambu
lance, but life was extinct before he
reached there.
The old eentleman was thrown off his
balance, and he was caught between the
floor of the cage and the wall of the ele
vator 6haft and dragged upward several
feet. By this time the elevator boy had
brought the cage to a standstill, and- the
body of the unfortunate man was dropped
to the stone floor below.
Orson C. West, an aged rancher residing
near Napa City, met an awful death by
being crushed by an elevator in the Phe

West and his ron, Alfred L. W r est. an in

about 6 o'clock to go to the younger man's
offices. The son stepped Into the elevator
and his father, who was close behind
him, had just got one foot Jnside the door
when the elevator suddenly shot upward.

The buffet car that has been found to
be the source of much complaint will still
be on the run, but improvements in Its
management have already been ordered.
In the future passengers occupying seats
in the ' day coaches or parlor car will be
served at their seats by the porters, - if
they so desire. Tables -will be placed
between the seats and patrons will not
have to go to the cafe car for lunch or
dinner should the cafe car be overcrowded.
A regular time table will be adopted for
the new local train. between here and Los
Angeles on the coast d- vision to-day.- .
General Manager Kruttschnitt held- a
conference yesterday w'th a number of
railroad officials and rjlans were laid for
the putting on of another local train to re
lieve the heavy traflic on the coast lino
This train is the oniy remedy that can
be made at present. It is impossible for
the limited to carry more cars and make
the time that it runs on now. The latter
train is made ui> of one parlor car, two
first-class" day coaches, a smoking and
buffet car, a postal and baggage car. The
New York Central Limited Express, which
is considered the fastest train in the
world, only, hauls five cars, and yet the
limited that travels between here and Log
Angeles makes nearly as good time. By
putting more cars on this train would
only mean that 'a longer; time schedule
would have to be made. "This the South
ern Pacific Company is reluctant to do,
hence the additional local train.
Since the opening of this line the traffic
has been enormous, especially from Los
Angeles to this city. All the tourist travel,
which is very large at this time of the
year, has come over this road. The con
sequence is that the trains each day have
been overcrowded, and the buffet car that
takes the place of a "diner 1 V has been
found inadequate to serve the. patrons.
The Call last Sunday called attention ex
clusively to the many inconveniences that
strangers are put io in the run up from
Los Angeles, and evidently the article had
the desired effect.
The Southern Pacific Company will at
once put on another local train on the
new coast division between this city and
Los Angeles to accommodate the in
creased traffic.
Owing to Heavy Traffic on
the New Road a Local
Is to Be Added. â¢

SAVES LIVES OF PUPILS
DENVER. April 8. â Nellie Rivlerre,
wife of Emil Rivierre of 720 South Tenth
street, who was said to have run away
with their twelve-year-old boy last Tues
day night,' has been mourned as dead by
her relatives in New York, and a grave
in Greenwood Cemetery has been dug to
receive her body. It was a trick played
by her husband, she says, to obtain money
to pay her expenses after desertion.
Last Tuesday night, according to her
statement, she left home for a few. min
utes and returned to find that her husband
had gone and taken Rena, their little boy,
with him. She found a note from her
husband saying he had gone, to New York
to attend a trial and would return. He
gave her directions to write, but instead
she telegraphed to her aunt, Mrs. Patter
son of 33 Monroe place. New York.' tell
ing that Rivierre had deserted her.
"I received the answer .this morning,"
she said. "Mrs. Patterson's letter stated
that Rivierre had written them that I was
ill and that the worst might be- expected.
The letter also said that a few days later
a- telegram was received from him sayinp
I was dead and to have a grave dug in
Greenwood Cemetery. With it was a re
quest for money to ship the body." '
Mrs. Patterson said that she had sent
$150: that the grave had been dug. and
that the family had ordered mourning
dresses. Then came Mrs. Rivierre's tele
gram, unconsciously exposing the trick.
The .Rivierres came to Denver from New
York about Christmas for Mrs. Rivierre's
health. The husband is an insurance
agent and an- expert bicycle rider. Mrs.
Rivierre says her aunt in New York is
prominent and Is worth about $700,000. She
will remain in Denver in the hope of find
ing some trace of her child.

City Prison on a charge of robbery. The
complaining witness is Michael Ryan, a
Fwitohman from Oakland.
Ryan said he was walking along Pacific
street shortly after 8 o'clock yesteray
morning: when he met Lanigan. who was
standing- outside the saloon. Ryan offered
to throw dice with Lanigan for 50 cents
a throw, but Lanigan doubted if he had
any money. Ryan lapped his vest pocket
and remarked he had plenty of money.
Then Lanigan made a grab for the vest
pocket, tearing it and getting possession
of $40. with which he skipped.
Ryan waited around the saloon till Lan
ijran made his appearance about 2 o'clock
in the afternoon, and then notified Police
man Skain. who placed Lanigan under

Who to blame for the presence of the

neighbor- v.hispered that the coalman pat

To-day Mr. Herold will be confronted by

Out on Pacific avenue the residents drÂ»

A halt was called in the investigation

All interest in the case of Dan J. Sulli
van, former bookkeeper in the office of
Warrant and Bond Clerk Peery. now cen
ters in the action to be taken by the
Grand Jury at its meeting to-night. Sul
livan enjoys the fresh air and repose of
the pky parlor jail in the Hall of Justice,
willingly speaks about what he has done
and sustains by figures the amount of his
alleged for/reiies. but there the matter
ends. He will not admit that any one but
himself profited by the facile pen he
wielded.
A peculiar and perhaps suspicious cir
cumstance develops through the course of
the investigation iuto these affairs. Sulli
van in his statement of Friday night
makes a confession, in which he purports
to set forth all the bogus orders? he re
members to have forged. He credits Judge
Cor.lan's court- with orders amounting to
$1100 out of the $1500 he admits having
forged. The latest one comes from the
same court, and no one. seems able to ex
plain how the money got out of the treas
ury except that Sullivan "did the act."
Is Charged to Sullivan.
Auditor Wells, although very guarded in
his utterances, intimated that the dis
crepancies between the bond and warrant
clerk's office and the County Clerk's Po
lice Court deputies would approximate
some &A0Q. Upon what basis he formu
lated this opinion he declined to state,
saying that an expert examination would
probably prov2 the correctness of his
statements.
The records of the Police Department,
whifh are now the only correct record of
Police Court transactions, were carefully
locked up last night, and the detailed his
tory cf the care could not be obtained. In
the safe in the office of County Clerk
Deane is a receipt showing that the
voucher representing the money paid on
this fine was deposited snd accepted by
the Treasurer, through Reis. on March 3lt.
The bail money Â¦was. however, drawn out
previously, so it looks as if the Treasurer
would have to make good the amount.
Another peculiar, transaction between
the treasury and the warrant and bond
clerk's office was made public yesterday,
when C B. Perkins, receiving-, cashier; of
Treasurer Brooks, and Chief Deputy
County Clerk Goddard, engaged in a dis
pute in tho office of Auditor Wells. It
wes all about a- matter of a $23D nne Im
posed in Police Court 2, over which Judge
Cc-nlan presides and of which ', John P.
Kice is clerk. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
W. Sylva was arrested, tried, convicted
End sentenced to pay a fine of $250. The
latter fact was certified to by Clerk Rice
of Judge Conlan's court and an order
was sent to County Clerk Deane certify
ing to these facts. Tho regular order,, ap
parently signed by Judge Conlan for the
bail money was turned in by Chief Deputy
Goudard. ond its receipt was acknowl
edged by Rcis," who was temporarily
acting in the place of Receiving Teller
Perkins.
'lms transaction occurred on March 30,
the day that Sullivan gathered In â¢ his
Ixjodle and went to Grass Valley. Later
it was discovered that the bail money that
was supposed to have been sufficient to .
have covered the fine had been previously
withdrawn. Neither Perkins nor God
dcrd would assume the responsibility for ,
the less of the money. Then they laid ,
their troubles before Auditor Wells.
"I know nothing about this matter,"
paid the Auditor last night, "except that
both .Perkins and Goddard came to see
me about it during the afternoon. One
accuses the other of the responsibility for j
the loss of the ?22>. Perkins says he will

upon the time of Expert Williams. It
will be resumed this morning. While
many peculiar transactions are being dis
covered, the end cannot be seen until a
complete comsarison Is made of all tho
book;;.
A host of witnesses, embracing former
Police Judges, attaches of Police Courts
and men conversant with the details of
Police Court practices, has been summon
ed to anoear before the Grand Jury to
night. Each one of these is supposed to
have Intimate knowledge of the way
things are done, but as each one may
have a personal and financial interest in
some transaction, except by inference, but
little may be obtained from their testi
mony.
Money Still Held in Treasury.
The tangle regarding the payment out
of the treasury of the moneys deposited
as ball still continues. Treasurer Brooks
will pay .no court orders. Auditor Wells
will not audit them, and not until City
and County Attorney Lane gives an opin
ion will those who have money in the
â¢rlty treasury obtain what belongs to them.
Police Judges refuse to sjgn orders for the
release of bail money until the o.uestion
Is settled. One exception in, however,
made to this rule,for the convenience of
the Police Court clerks: When the
amount of the line equals the amount of
the bail deposited, the order is signed and
sent as a voucher to the County Clerk.
These arc ax-cumulating rapidly, and the
County Clerk looks for all kinds of trou
ble at the end of the month if some plan
is not devised to straighten the matter
out. All the vouchers ndw in Clerk
Deane's custody represent money actual
ly in deposit in the city treasury, and it
is only a small matter of bookkeeping to
get the accounts straightened out. But
Treasurer Brooks is obstinate. Orders for
the personal withdrawals of money are
held up in the same manner; so County
Clerk Deane has a mass of sympathizers.
Judge Cabaniss has been endeavoring to
secure the appointment by Mayor Phelan
of a Justice of the Peace to take his place
on the bench when the preliminary ex
amination of Sullivan comes up to-mor
row morning. He has had several confer
ences with Secretarv Fay, apparently be
ing unable to meet the luayor in his of-
Jice. From conversations had with Fay,
Judge Cabajiiss thinks that the Mayor
will act and appoint Justice of tne Peace
Percy V. Long to act instead of himself.
Grand Jurcr E, A. Schmitt, chairman of
the committee on Superior, Justices and
Police courts is elaborating a plan to pro
vide a bookkeeper and cashier to relieve
the warrant and bond clerk in a measure
from the financial complications of his
office. The plan will be embodied as a
part of the report of the Grand Jury. He
will be an additional attache of the office,
under heavy bonds, ai>d will receive all
moneys. Â¦
Peery Figures TJ*p His Losses.
Warrant and Bond Clerk Peery is at
present out about $510. Of this amount
$410 is represented in orders cashed by
him. but which the Treasurer now refuses
to accept in lieu of the money. The other
$100 is the money paid to Pistolesl at the
time the hai! In the Tempone case was
reduced. Pistolssi claimed- to be sick
when the discovery was made, and al
though he has been out for several days
has not yet seen fit to help Peery out of
the tangle into which he so obligingly got
himself.
The necessity of the appointment of. a
cashier, although it might be a technical
violation of the charter, is evidenced by
the fact that since its inauguration some
fifteen months ago the v.arrant and bond
clerks office has handled more than $420,
000 in bail moneys. â¢
A strong profest against the transfer
of Ambrose Watson .roni Judge Hunt's
department of the Superior Court to Judge
Fritz's department of the Police Court
to succeed Clerk J. J. Groom has been
made to County ClerK Deane by every '
one who has had dealings with Watson
in his present position. Now Clerk Deane
is casting about for a suitable and reliable
clerk to take Groom's place. He will
reach a decision in a day or two, and in
the meantime Groom is acting in his old
capacity.

Homer Lee, a former Stanford student,
who went to China a little more than a
year ago, and who is now a general in the
Imperial Array of the Emperor of China,
is at present a guest at the Palace.
Lee has recently returned from China
and is on his way to Washington and
London to attempt to Induce the "Amer
ican and English governments to inter
vene and again place the Emperor of
China on the throne. He says the Dow
ager Empress is the cause of all the
trouble in China and that she is receiv
ing the moral support of the Russian
Government. Lee carries with him a
number of ghastly photographs, illus
trating the barbaric manner in which the
Chinese are executed at present by the
Empress, which not only includes the be
heading of victims, but also the mutila
tion of the bodies by cutting off the arms
and legs. Lee claims that one of the in
novations of the Emperor before he was
dethroned and â¢ imprisoned was the pro
hibiting of any more of those acts of bar
barity. ,.
"You must understand that China is
divided into two sections," he said. "The
Yangtse River forms the division. All
that lies north of this river is governed
by the Dowager Empress and all south of
it by the Emperor, or at least, by his fol

who was coaxed into it by the Russians,

eventually secure control of China.

was simply trying to modernize China
and following in the footsteps of Japan.
