The writer, of the review asserts that
Count von Bulow, when complaining last
Friday about the intrigues of prlvate'com
panies in China, meant particularly the
Belgian syndicate which Is now trying to
secure the concession for the railway from
Peking to Hankow. After expressing a
hope . that the Belgians will Â¦ fall, because
their success would be at the sreneral ex

probably be able ' and willing to ' ''squeeze
this Uny 'Jack In the box' into a corner."
In- an able weekly review the Kreuz

vances In the far East, Including the ac
quisition of territory at Hankow, by
means of which Russia Invaded the Yang

had to endure because the South African
war paralyzes her aggressive powers."

grow up serious differences, because that

Â¥IENTSIN, March 20/11:35 a. m, â After pulling out of the station yesterday afternoon Count von Walciersee's train was brought to a standstill by the phe
nomenal storm of dust which has been blowing since vMonday. Instead of proceeding to Peking Count von Waldersee was therefore compelled to return here for
the night. He refrains, however, from making any further. efforts to adjust the Anglo-Russian conflict.
It now transpires that at the very moment of Count von Waldersee's arrival General Wogack, acting upon instructions from the Russian Imperial
Government, made a formal demand upon General Campbell for the withdrawal of the British, troops 'from. the disputed territory. He - further, demanded â¢ an apology
from the British commander for the alleged trespass of his force. , t
Up to the present time General Wogack has received no reply excepting a simple acknowledgment of the receipt of his demand, which, I am informed, is
couched in language which resembles "an ultimatum. - - *

SANTA CLARA. March Â£0.-Some
one has said that time Is measured
by events, not by periods. If this
be true, almost a decade must
have been poised by the Inhabi
tants of Santa Clara In the past two
days, The plaza opposite the sleepy old
Gray clock tower of. the college has been
turned Into a baseball ground, and where
vaqueros may once have reined their
prancing bronchos yoUng fellows tried
wind and muscle on the running track,
and the crack of the starter a pistol
owoke the echoes of the dormitory build-
Ings.
And the little town adjacent was lively
with the chatter of gay throngs. Early
this morning, before 8 o'clock, the rattle
of a drum corps aroused the sluggards In
the village. It was the greatest day
Santa Clara has knownâ this, the second
session, so to speak, of tho great fiftieth
anniversary of the foundation of Santa
Clara College. More tjian 10,000 persona
thronged the streets. This morning's
trains from north and south brought
scores of visitors. San Jose alone Is es
timated to have cent 2500 of her residents
to the celebration. All sorts of vehicles
bore them, from the prototype of the
venerable and historic "one-hoss shay" to
the modern runabout, sleek with red
paint. â¢ .'
Parade Moves Promptly.
Around the old towers of the college
centered the chief point of Interest, de
spite the" fact that - this was considered
"town day." Father Kenna and the
faculty were all astir bright and early.
The movements of the parade might have
supplied an example to many -a city
pageant." Contrary to all precedent, the
flrst columns moved off punctually at the
appointed hour. The various division
marshals assembled at 8:30 o'clock and a
half hour later the pageant left tho so
dality campus and moved along the
crowded streets.

SAN JOSE, March 2O.-Twenty-elght

a- Jury In Judge Rhodes* court to-day as
sessed the damages sustained by Miss Lil
lian Steffanl by reason of the negligence
of the Southern Pacific Company In al
lowing hoodlums to tnrow rocks Into Its
cars and injure passengers. Miss Steffanl,
while a passenger on a train from San
Francisco on May 7, 1899. was hit by a
rock thrown from a passing excursion
train. The missile struck her on the left
temple. -She was rendered unconscious
and remained so for some days. Her
health was impaired and she has been an
invalid ever since. The girl's lower limbs
are paralyzed nr.d she is subject to epi
leptic fits. A strong point In her favor
was that she was treated by a railroad
physician. .
Miss Steffani sued the railroad company
for $50,000. D. M. Ekelmas and Attorney
Jannan appeared for her. The point
raised In the cage was that the railroad
company was responsible for the acts of
passengers on tre train when their acts
affected other passengers.
Â¦ The case was jriven to the Jury at 11
o'clock; this morning, and an hour later
It returned a verdict giving Miss Steffani
$28,000. A stay of thirty days was granted
the defendant.' and the railroad company
will appeal from the Judgment.
Miss Steffanl's case Is an especially sad
one. For the gre'ater part of last night

SACRAMENTO, March 20.â Miss Rob
ertson, a young colored woman! caused to
be circulated a story that the pastor of
the African Methodist Church of this city,
Rev. J. L. Whitney, had sought to take
unwarranted liberties with her and she de
clared to some of the flock that on one oc
casion when, she -visited tho church alone
the pastor had actually kissed" her. The
story has caused considerable of a flut
ter In local colored- circles and an investi
gation has been called by the pastor
himself, who declares that there Is noth
lnK.ln the t tatements of the young woman
further than he touched her on the
shoulder In a fatherly fashion. It-ap^
pears that Miss Robert-son has recanted
all that she had said, with the exception
of the statement that she received a pas
toral kiss.
Rev. Mr. Whitney makes the following
statement concerning the affair:
Some time asro my -wife and I were discuss
ing the matter of arranging for an Easter
celebration, and In going over thÂ« material at
our command we found that we did not have a
sufficient number of yountr women to success
fully carry out the programme we had under
consideration. I then wrote to San Francisco
for suitable Eastern Sunday-school exercises
und secured a very elaborate service. But
here again I was confronted with the old ob
stableâour Sunday-school did not have In Irs
membership enough . young women to execute
it.
My wife then suggested that I endeavor to
Induce come young women, even if not mem
bers of our church or Sunday-School, to assist
us. "With this end in view I called at the
home of two young women, both of whom
were out at the time. Later one of them called
at the parsonage to see about the Easter ser
vice. - V
My wife hud rone out for a few minutes
and I asked the youn* woman to take a seat.
After a few minutes I suggested that she neej
not wait lonjrir. but could call at a later date
to arrange with my wife for thÂ« nervices.
Now. I have a habit Â«f tapping a person
llKhtly on the shoulder. It's really not an In
discretion, for It's wholly habit with me. As
the young woman arose to leave I tapped her
upon the shoulder, and expressed the hone that
she would be able to aislst us. thanked her for
the interest she had shown, and that's all
there whs to it.

AFTER EFFECTS OF GRIP.
Itself.
Are Often More Serious Than the Grip
Physicians arid grip sufferers alike are
agreed that tho after effects of the dis-
ease are more *o be frared than the acute
attack: you can never be sure that the
disease has left the system completely.
Ia Grippe naturally attacks the weakest
organ and leaves It still weaker.
Not only pneumonia, consumption, bron-
chitis and throat trouble follow the grip,
but kidney, liver and stomach are trou-
bles just as liable to result, provided any
of these organs should happen to be In a
w^ak condition at the time of attack.
To get rid c,t the grip germ, to get it en-
tirely out of the system and blood, few
remedies are po good and none safer than
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets. They are not a
compound of powerful and dangerous <
drugs, but a pleasant, palatable, conve-
nient remedy In tablet form, composed of
the wholesome antiseptic principles of eu-
calyptus bark, blood root and - similar
frcfmlcide remedies, which are perfectly
wholesome and harmless to the system,
but death lo the germs of grip, catarrh,
consumption ind diseases of the throat
and air passages.
Mrs. Charles Gormley of Memphis says:
1/wst winter an attack of the grip left me
yrt*h wmk back, a persistent cough and
)oÂ£B of flesh and appeUte, and after using
various remedies for several months with
little or no Improvement I finally bought
a 60-cÂ«Â»nt package of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets at my drugstore, and aa they were
pleasant and convenient to take 1 used
them at all times of day or night, and I
was astonished to secure such fine results
from so pleasant and convenient a medi-
cine. In two weeks my cough disap-
peared, my appetite returned. I Improved
In flesh and color, and no one would now
think that I had ever had such a thing as
the grip. ...
My druggist told me he sold more of
Etuart's Catarrh Tablets for -the* cure of
grip, colds and catarrh than any other
similar medicines.

"I have been simply amazed at the Ir

late to change the figures of the tenth
census, but it will be the policy of this
office to punish every offender. St. Mary's

curred. In one count of one of the dis

The total population, including the pad
ded names, aggregated 18,136. The enu
merator. S. F. Abell, was arrested last

Is stated that these governments organ

to a certain extent, and in each com

organized upon a Dasis to meet the re

part it is said the governments are of a

Socialists : demand that the Government'
should Intervene in favor of the striker",
and are disgruntled at the employment of
troops. On the other hand the. Govern

negotiate, â¢ the masters having declined to
do so on the ground that the strike was
unjustifiable and a breach of a previous

the Socialists will make reprisals for this
insult from the Government, and Up.

when; as-he puts it, by entering Mr Kru

A crowd of 2000 burst through a cordon

depleting the whole nervous system
causes the mucous membrane surfaces to
suffer accordingly. This is the condition
called systemic catarrh. It very nearly
resembles, and there is really no practi-
cal difference, between this condition and
the condition known as neurasthenia, or
nervous prostration.
Â¦ Peruna will be found to effect an' Im-

systemic catarrh. .It acts quickly and
beneficially . on the diseased mucous
membranes, and with healthy mucous
membranes the catarrh can no longer

Peruna a True Friend to "Women.
Mrs. F. J. Lynch writes the following
from 324 S. Division street. Grand Rapids,
Mich.:
The Peruna Medicine Co.. Columbus. O.:
Gentlemen: VI : earnestly recommend
Peruna to any- suffering woman, as It
cures quickly. Last year I had a most
persistent cough, which nothing seemed
to "cure. Two bottles of Peruna did more
for me than all the doctors seemed to
do. In a couple of weeks I found myself
in excellent health, and have been enjoy-
ing it ever since. Hence I look on Pe-
runa as â¢ a Â¦ true friend to women." â Mrs.
F. J. Lynch.
Peruna is equally efficacious In curing
catarrh of the throat as in curing sys-
temic catarrh or catarrh of the stomach.
Catarrh Is essentially the same wherever
located. Peruna cures catarrh.
Peruna Makes You Feel Like a New
Person.
Miss Marie Coats, a popular , young
woman of Appleton, Wis.. and president
cf the Appleton Young Ladies' Club, also
rpeaks in glowing terms of Peruna. A
letter recently received from her by The
"I have used It now for three seasons,
and find it very valuable and efficacious."
â Mlsa Marie Coats.
Diseased nerves are traceable directly
to poor digestion, and poor dlpestlon 13
directly traceable to catarrh. With the
slightest catarrh of the stomach no one
can have good digestion.
Very few of the many women who hare
catarrh of the stomach suspect what
their real trouble la. They know they
belch after meals, have sour stomach, a
sensation of weight or heaviness, a full-
ness,irrsgtJlar appetite, drowsiness", gnaw-
ing, empty sensation?, occasional pain â
they all know this: but they do not know
that their trouble is catarrh of the
stomach. If they did they would take
Peruna.
Peruna cures catarrh wherever located.
As soon as Peruna removes catarrh from
the stomach the digestion becomes good,
sppetite regular, nerves strong, and
trouble vanishes. Peruna strengthens
weak nerves, not by temporarily stimu-
lating them, but by removing the cause
of weak nerves^ â poor digestion. This Is
the only cure that lasts. Remove the
cause: Nature will do the rest. Peruna
removes the cause.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna.
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratis.
Address Or. Tla^tman. President of Ths
Hartman Sanitarium. Columbus, O.
Peruna Medicine Company of Columbus,
Ohio, reads as follows:
"I am glad to call the attention of my
friends to Peruna. When that langruld.
tired feeling cornea over you, and your
food no longer tastes good, and small an-
noyances irritate you. Peruna will make
you feel like another person. Inside of a
week.
"/{am sincerely grateful for the
relief I have found from the use of
Peruna. I was completely used up
last fall, my appetite had failed and
I felt weak and tired all the time. My
druggist advised me to try Peruna,
and the relief I experienced after
taking one bottle was truly wonderful.
"I continued its use for five weeks,
and am glad io say that my complete
restoration to health was a . happy
surprise to myself as well as to my
friends." â Anna Prescoit.

self in favor . : of I the operation . of the
Geary-street road by the city at the ex
.piratlon of Its franchise. Chairman Reed
called attention to the fact that the fran
chise would expire on -April 13. 1902.- and
he urged that the city begin Immediately
thereafter the construction of Â¦ a modern
underground ' electric road with flat rails
and the most recent electric : motive ap
pliances obtainable.. He moved that a

for the purpose of arranging a match be
tween the trotters. The Abbott and Bo
ralma. but failed to come to terms and
the match was declared off. Mr. Scannell
Insisted on having three out of five heats,
to which Mr. L-awson's representatives

en heats should be the conditions. Mr.
Scannell said he was now ready to race
his horse. The Abbott, against any horse
in the world for {50,000, best, three in five
heats, the gate receipts to go to charity.

posit of $10,000 which he put up through
his New York representative to bind a
race with The Abbott. These are the in
stitutions Mr. Lawson had selected to re
ceive the $25,000 guaranteed gate receipts
if Boralma defeated The Abbott, -Mr.
Scannell having agreed to accept - chari
ties In New York ag the recipients In case
his horse won. But the race having fall
en through, Mr. Lawson decided that his
first deposit of $10,000 should go for a
worthy cause. .
"Â¦ In : a statement issued ' to-night Mr.
Lawson said he regretted that the race
had fallen through, .but he had no desire
to criticize the action of others ; in con
nection with the matter. He reviewed the
negotiations^ and the reasons 'for. their
failure, announcing his gift -> of $10,000 to
the Institutions; and concluded with these
words:; "With this: I trust all Interested
friends of the horse ..will call the-inci

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
."With one. magnanimous Btroke the
board of directors and the board of stew
ards of the California Jockey. Club, save
In a few of. ' the most flagTant cases of
turf dishonesty, restored to good standing
a small army of derelicts who had' met
disaster at the Oakland and the old Bay
District race tracks during the years
Â¦past. ' ' â¢--'.; ., .- Â¦ . â¢ ;
Secure in his command of the local
racing situation, if was a -generous and
fitting thing for Thomas H. Williams to
recommend the ; restoration to full privi
leges of the unfortunates who have found
themselves under the ban of the racing
authorities at different times occupying
the judges' stand on his race â¢ courses.
Scattered all over America are the mis
guided individuals who tried to cast dis
credit upon the sport and who will now
be allowed back into the fold after pro
tracted wanderings, upon the understand
ing that they will keep in the narrow
path henceforth and repent the evil of
their ways. . :
Only in a few flagrant cases was the
amnesty denied, i The memorable scandal
of the "Little Pete", conspiracy, although
many years have passed since it was rife,
was too fresh in the minds of the officials
to be, condoned. Trainer Williams, and
Jocke>-s Chorn, Chevalier and HirtTichs
were specifically mentioned as those who
may expect no forgivenness. "LJttle
Pete,", the wily arch conspirator, in the
famous scandal that brought these men
to grief, is dead, but the machinations of
the quintet will long stand in turf lore
as the most colossal conspiracy to corrupt
the sport ever attempted in this or any
other country. In addition to eliminating
their names from? the pardon list the
directors kept under advisement the cases
of Jockey Wedderstrand . and H. Green
berg. Following is the official report of
the action of the directors and stewards:
'At a meeting of the board of directors and
the board of stewards of the California Jockey
Club the following proceedings were had:
By unanimous vote of the board of. stewards
and the board of directors of the California
Jockey Club Dow Williams, Jerry Chorn. H.
Chevalier, A. Hinrichs and J. Rubenstein Btand
ruled oft the turf. .
The cases of H. Greenbergr and H. Wedder
strand remain under advisement. All others
heretofore under the ban are hereby reinstated
and restored to Rood standing. ,
Many names long familiar .to the fol
lowers of the turf are included In the
roster of those to be given a final chance.
Jockey Willie Martin, one of the- best
riders ever seen in the saddle in -Califor
nia, Is probably the most important
among them. : Martin has been cooling
his heels on the ground for many weary
months. . He has stanch friends and has
made a persistent effort to get back Into
the silken Jacket. He will ride for the
popular racing firm of Burns & Water
house, and returns to the pigskin with a
chance to redeem himself and ride rap-
Idly Into the front rank of jockeys, where
he belongs if he will grasp it. Joe Pig
pott, another promising rider, will get an
other Inning. Other jockeys of less note
who are within the pale of grace are
Jack Ward,. Joe Webber, Stuart Peters,
Cy. McLain, W. Narvaez, W. H. Martin,
Ben Gouinni Jesse Connelly, Frank Coady
and Claude Burllngame. " ' 'Â¦'Â¦'
"Counselor" Bill Brien, erstwhile train
er for Lucky 'Baldwin, and a shifty man
with a thoroughbred, . Is among the pen
itents who. strayed into evil ways.' Danny
Lynch, he of Sharkey fame and general
issimo of the Hardknot episode, can once
more bask in the sunlight of the club's
paddocks. . Sandy McNaughton, Joe Rose
and "Moose" Taylor will be reinitiated.
"Dick" Williams, now training the big
stable belonging to Barney Schreiber, will
have a chance to get out* of the stalls on
the back stretch while his charges come
to the Judges' stand. Al Goodln and
Harry -Wise, manipulators of the San
Rosas "ringing" case, are back.
. Others besides the bigger flsh already
enumerated who can get past the turn
stiles without taking a chance of being
later shot through the gates are "Vlcks

TURF DERELICTS
GIVEN A CHANCE
The California Jockey Club
Stewards Start With a
New Slate. --, '
BY F. E. MTJLHOLLAND.
0WENT MOUNCE demonstrated at
Tanforan Park r yesterday, that he
is capable of riding with the best
of 'em. On horses -that were all
quoted at liberal odds in. the bet
tirgr. one being Cromwell, a 20 to 1 shot,
the Idaho boy three times caught the eye
of the judges first, and once finished sec
ond. Henry, Dominick and O'Connor were
each credited with one winner. The big
crowd had eix well balanced fields of
platers to wrestle with, and succeeded In
taking three lalls when Topmast scored
at lo to 10, Brenhllda at 4 to 5, and by the
win of Amelia Fonso, another mild choice.
The curtain raiser was a six-furlong
selling sprint, for which Milt Henry's
mount Moonbright, closed a luke-warm
favorite. The Sacramento contingent
backed Eonic, the Stembler entry, from
8 dewn to 5, and in a drive Mounce got
the filly over the lilie first, a length ahead
of Small Jack, the pacemaker. Henry
rod3 a slovenly race astride the favorite,
ending up in the show.
Barney Schreiber's black imp. Sain filly
Zirl defeated the favorite. Rory Ough, for
the two-year-old . scramble, and at the
same time cut the track record for three
and a half furlongs to -Al%. Meeting. on
equal terms, Rory Ough, while the natu
ral favorite, eventually closed at about
the st' me price as Ogle, while 7 to 2 could
be had about Zirl. Thorpe on Rory out
broke his field, but the chestput colt was
collared and clearly out gained by the
black miss, losing out by half a length.
Dominick rode a very pretty race on the
winner. Ogle ran third.
No pace whatever was set by the lead
ers In the mile and a furlong event, and
even with all the bad racing luck he had.
Topmast finally won easily. The Car
ruthers & Shields horse was played down
from 2 to 13 to 10, and cut off near
ly half a dozen times, hit the wire a
length In advance of Topmast. O'Connor,
astride Josephine, made no effort to
go to the front, when he must have
seen the pace was slow, and brought up
in th<> show.
Last in his previous race, decided over
the Oakland track, Cromwell at 15 and
20. to 1 backed down to 12, dropped from
the clouds with Mounce in the seven
furlong run, beating Merops, the favo
rite, half a length. The latter horse went
to the post favorite over Vain, and with
the purse .in sight Henry took a nap and
was nipped out. It is more than probable
that Vain but for being cut off at the
start would have won. Dominick then
made too much use of the horse, rushing
him from ninth to second position in go
ing a quarter, and tiring near the close,
came in third.
Something almost unusual for her, Billy
Magrane's old mare Amelia Fonso cam*
from behind, and beat a bunch of nine
others, in the second seven-furlong jaunt.
Her odds were hammered down from 5 to
1& to 5, and she lasted just long enough
to win. Lizzella came with a terrific rush
and looked to have been downed, by a
neck, but Tom Calvert was placed second
and Lizzella third.
Quite overdue, Brenhllda finally suc
ceeded in escaping from the maiden class.
The mare ruled a 4 to 5 choice for the
closing elx and a half furlong jaunt, and
never extended, won easily from William
F and Master Cal.

The coursing- programme for Saturday

of the bert hounds now running. It is
as follows: .
Maryland Legislature Passes
a Law Excluding the
Illiterate.
The effect of the law is, of course, large
ly a matter of conjecture and one upon
"which the party leaders widely differ. The
Democrats expect that it will disfranchise
about 22,000 negroes and perhaps 16,000
white voters. Of these, it is claimed, all
the negroes and about 50 per cent of the
white vote the Republican ticket. With
these out of the way, it Is held that the
â¢Btate will be safely Democratic for many
Â¦ years to come and that the immediate re-
Bult will be the election of a Democratic
Legislature next fall and of a Democrat
to eucceed United States Senator Welling
ton in 1302.
The most important change In existing
methods accomplished ' by the enactment
of the new law lies In depriving illiterate
voters of the assistance of ballot clerks
in preparing their ballots. Under the pre
vious practice these clerks accompanied
such voters Into the booths and marked
their ballots for them or showed them
how to do it. The Democrats claim that
this practice utterly destroyed the .secrecy
of the ballot and made it possible for cor
ruptlonists to learn whether bargains
made with corrupt voters had been car
ried out.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 2O.-The new
election bill, having for Â¦ its object the
practical disfranchlsement of most of the
00,000 Illiterate voters of the State, passed
the Senate shortly after noon to-day. It
was Immediately sent to the House, where
all the amendments made by the Senate
were concurred in, and the bill passed. It
is now ready for the Governor's signature.

"WASHINGTON. March" 20.-Dlrector
General of Posts. Cotterman of the Philip
pines has reported to the Postofflce De
partment that within the past few months
a great many complaints have been re
ceived at Manila, indicating pilfering from
the malls. Most of the mail dispatched
from the Philippines, &s well as that re
ceived, orignates at army posts, â¢ Â¦where
there is no regular postofflce. Much of this
mall is carried between the army poet and
' the nearest postofflce In tied sacks on
. pack trains. The report goes Into detail
regarding the necessity, for lmartnts on
the wax seals of mail sacks as reccm
menfled by the Director General in a re
port received yesterday. Mr. Cotterman
requests a supply of 150 hand presses
with a die on each bearing a distinctive
number. He adds:
, "Many sacks of mail are carried on
' steamer* doing a local traffic throughout
the Islands, but which are not under Gov
ernment control. The crews of 'these
steamers are comprised wholly of native*
or Spaniards and the time has not arrived
'when these people can be trusted to any
extent."

The Forest Home was built at Marsh
field. Or., and went into commission the
latter part of 1900. She is 6S2 tons net
burden. 173 feet 4 inches long, 40 feet beam
and 15 feet 2 inches deep. From here she
wer.t to Port Gamble, where Captain Col
etrup took command. She was loaded
with 873,049 feet of lumber, valued at
SS74D, and en November 21 last a start was
made for Valparaiso. Just when the fire
broke out the cable does not state, but
it must have been Bome time ago as the
long passage was in all probability due
to the blaxe.
The cable to the Merchants' Exchange
is as follows:
"Schooner Forest Home arrived at Cal
lao March IS, from Port Gamble. Had
-been on fire. Stores and cabin damaged.
Part of deckload Jettisoned. Rudder un
serviceable." From this it would appear
that the fire broke out in the lazarette and
spread to the cabin. Before It could be
put out it must have charred the rudder
post to such an extent that the vessel
could not be steered until a Jury rudder
had been rigged. In this disabled con
dition the Forest Home made Callao,
where repairs wM be made. It will not
take the ship's carpenter long to make the
necessary repairs, so the schooner will
not be delayed more than a few days.
SIEBBA WINS THE BACK
Defeats Occidental and Oriental Com
pany's Coptic in Bun to Honolulu.
The Oceanic Steamship Company has
another flier in its fleet and the Sonoma
will have to look to her laurels. The
uteamship Sierra and the Occidental and
Oriental Company's Coptic sailed from
San Francisco for Honolulu onÂ» March 7.
The Coptic passed Meiggs wharf at 1:50
p. m. and the Sierra at 7:40 p. m. .Ther6
Â¦was considerable wagering on the result
of the ClOO-mlle run, the bulk of the bets
going on the Coptic owing to the poor
showing madÂ« by the Sierra on her maid
en voyage. The Coptic's backers over
looked the fact, however, that all the de
fects in the Sierra had been rectified and
that she was in first-class order in every
department. The confidence of the Sierra's
backers has been rewarded as she beat
the Coptic by about 7 hours and 30 min
utes on the run to the Paradise of the
Pacific. â , 'Â¦
The Oceanic Company s Sonoma left
Honolulu at 9 p. m. on the 12th lnst.
When about four liours out she passed
the Sierra, under a full head of eteam,
racing for Honolulu. An hour and a half
later the Coptic waa passed and she also
was going fuUspeed. Allowing the Sierra
four hours in which to complete the voy
age and she must have made the run in
about 5 days 12 hours. She has the long
est part of her run still before her. how
ever, and will have to keep up her lick
in order to equal the Sonoma's record.

A Whaler Beats His Creditors.
Jose I>ominguez. a boat steerer on the
whaling brig Jeanette, was badly wanted
on the front yesterday afternoon. He se
cured a $200 advance note from the owner
of the vessel and had a good time on the
money instead of paying his debts. He
owes Manuel Lopez, who keeps a sailor
boardine-house, $168. and the latter got a
warrant out for the whaler's arrest.
Officer Henneberry was sent from the
Harbor Police Station to bring the man
ashore, but Dominguez got away. The tug
Monarch had the Jeanette in tow and
Dominguez was in one gasoline launch,
Â¦while Officer Henneberry was In another.
The Monarch and her tow passed between
the launches and Dominguez clambered
aboard thjj whaler, while all Henneberry
could do was to call on Captain Xewth to
heave his vessel to. The order was ig
nored and Dominguez is well on his way
to the Arctic Lopez will have to wait
twelve months for his money.
Islust Serve an Apprenticeship.
From now on no foreigner can be an of
ficer In the American mercantile marine
uslesa be has served five months on an
American vessel. Hitherto any outsider
could "declare his intention," pass his ex
amination before the local inspectors, and
Etep into the command of an American
vessel. This has all been changed now,
znuca to the Joy of American sailors.
Another change made by the Supervis
ing Inspector General Is this:
"Any person who has had five years'
experience on sail vessels, over 700 tons,
groes. two years of which must have been
*m master of such sail vessels, may be li
censed as master of ocean and coastwise
6t6am vessels."
The same rule applies to chief mates,
Â¦while second mates must have three
years" experience and one year's service
as second mate. Third mates need only
have the three years' experience.

they could not obtain, without the use of
the papers, the result being that many
whites were deprived of positions. This

Thousands of Acres Taken Up in
Desert â Leasing of Large
Areas Goes On. in many
Sections. -
The Kern County oil men are concerned
over the assessments of oil lands for pur
poses of taxation. The Assessor has
made the statement that he, would assess
the lands .at the price that they were
held at by the owners. This met with
protest, and a proposition was then ad
vanced to make the assessment $1000 per
acre a uniform valuation. The oil men
demand a reduction from that rate. A
suggestion has been made by a man re
cently from Wood County, Ohio, that the
assessment should be at the rate, of $100
per well, which is the custom In Ohio.
At any rate that Is adopted, Kern County
will have no reason to complain of a
lack of revenue for many years to come.
Reuben Houck's mule kicked Into view
a rich deposit of asphaltum In one of the
hitherto undeveloped sections of the Mc-
Kittrlck district a few days ago. Two
shafts have been sunk in asphaltum since
that lucky kick. Oil may also be found in
the locality^ ' Â» -â¢
Forty rigs are at work in the Coallnga
district, which is now the scene of much
activity. : . ' . Â¦
Six thousand acres in the Mojave des
ert have been filed on by Eastern parties,
who believe that there is a chance to de
velop oil there.
There eetnis to be a general Impression
among the operators In the Kern River
field, so says the Bakersfleld Calif ornian,
that the wells do better if kept on the
beam for a few months until large quan
tities of sand that enter the casing are
exhausted. Consequently many are pre
paring to lay up their power plants and
raise thÂ© oil by the more expensive but
more satisfactory method.
Work is about to begin on the lands
near Rosalia, Wash. Machinery has been
purchased.
Well Near Stockton Urged.
W. W. Westbay. of Stockton Is urging
the sinking of an experimental well near
Stockton. It is probable that the experi
ment will be made.
Santa Rosa parties have been looking
over the Paterson ranch in Bennett Val

that burns, so ."ays the Santa Rosa Demo

Farmers and business men of Tehama
and Glenn counties have formed a- gas
and oil company and have leased 15,000
acres of land: The persons interested in
the enterprise live in Paskenta, Newvllle
and Orland.
The Marin Journal says:
A week or more ago several parties filed upon
tide and overflow lands on Bollnas Bay under
the mineral laws of the United States, the ob
ject belnr to secure .the benefits which may
arise from the oil developments which are now
going on. Most If not all of these lands have
been Â»old to Bollnas people by the State of
California, and the owners propose to contest
the claims of these persons who have flled
upon the land. The owners have employed E.
B. Mart inelll as their attorney to look after
their Interests. The boring for oil continues.
The Harvey well was down SCO feet on Tues
day.
. Prospecting in Northern Counties.
The Vacavllle Leader says that from the
Capay Valley In the south to Redding in
the north the oil belt of the western side
of the Sacramento Valley is alive with
active developments. Every road is full
of people passing from point to point look
ing for available locations. The necessary
result Is the rapid, advance in the value
of lands. Acreage which could be ob
tained for t few dollars per acre a'few
months ago Is now held at $30 or $40, and
In some localities where the oil indica
tions are the most favorable at $10) or
more.
C. B. Forward.' general manager of the
Forward Reduction Company of Cleve

Los Angeles that he has succeeded in
making lubricants of all grades 'from the
heavy gravity Callfprnla oils, from the
lightest to the heaviest machine oil, and
to the heaviest machine cycinder oils
j which are superior to anything else now
on the market.

.Five leases of land for oil exploitation
were recently recorded In one day In
Santa Cruz, .aggregating 250 acres.
The Angels Record has a story of find
ing natural gas in large quantity in Cala
veras County. The finder Is Henry Spm
olla. The report continues:' "While he
( was at- work sinking a shaft on Centra*
(Hill he struck a stronc flow of naturul
gas. The shaft in which the flow was en
' countered is at' a' depth of 120 feet and is
\ in sand. About twelve feet of blue gravel
Â¦ was first passed through, then four feet
; of lava, then a stratum carrying gas. Spin
; olla.was sharp enough to turn the pas to
; account and is working by the light of
Â« burning gas. This may be an evidence of
i oil and we may have an oil craze in this
â¢ vicinity."
' Locations in San Luis Obispo.
; Over 2000 mining locations have been
' flled in San Luis Obispo County by the
County Recorder 'since last April, mainly
. on account of the search for oil.
Captain Lucas, who discovered the
â¢ Beaumont gusher in Texas, also found

: The Summerland Advance Courier
1 says a proposition is under consideration
which may result In the sinking of deep
, wells in the Summerland district, on the
; Ortega ranch. No one has yet thorough
; ly explored the district. Well drillers
> have been satisfied to stop in the first,
i second or third sand, at depths varying
i from 60 to 500 feet. Several applications
t have been made to the owners of the
Ortega ranch to lease small strips,' but
| the owners have preferred to sell the
; ranch to leasing It. A movement Is on
foot to buy, bond or lease the entire prop

' fully.
\ Natural gas is reported to have been

> Dutch India oil has made some headway
r In the Orient. , Borneo oil Is gradually
2 being placed on sale at all the various
1 distributing ports, of the Far East from
" Penang to Yokohama. A Japanese capi
talist, -Mr.;' Asano, has arranged for.lm
- porting about . 2.000,000 gallons of Borneo
' oil per month. The first shipment reached
Â» Japan in November last. In 1SS9 the im
" portatlons into China were 40.724.9S9 gal
t Ions of American oil; 35,695,116 of the Rus
sian and 11,993,202 of the Dutch Indian oil.
. Each port In the Far East -has its own
.' method of -distribution. Competition is
- threatened In the Japanese supply. In the
province of Echigo â¢ the oil industry Is
â¢ old, possibly hundreds of years, but has
\ hitherto been conducted on a small scale
2 'with rude; and ancient appliances. It is
â¢ now on an American basis and large capi
tal is employed. -.The Standard Oil Com
pany has acquired land in the province
for the location of a refining plant. Pipe
- lines are also coming Into favor In Japan.
", Concerning Pipe Lines.
s A. S. Cooper writes to the Mining and
0 Scientific Press that In planning for pipe
\ lines the flow of water has to be taken as
; a standard from which the comparison of
1 the flow of petroleum can be approxlmate
1 ly determined. When the fluidity of pet
t roleum Is ascertained then by comparing
t It with the. fluidity, of water the flow of
Â» oil through pipe lines can be determined if

WHENEVER the Legislatures of the various
States are in session the country gets the bene
fit of something like a variety show on a large
scale. In almost every State capital there arises some
new statesman who has a plan for curing a social de
fect by an act of legislation as simple as a patent pill
This year we have not had such a brilliant display of
legislative meteors as in the past, but still something
has been done for instruction and amusement, and it
will be worth while to give at least a casual attention
to the more meritorious of the performances.
In the shows of the year our own Legislature made
almost no display. It was quiet. The reformers were'
not conspicuous in the proceedings of either house.'
Consequently we must look away from home to see
what might be done in the way of improvement if
only it were possible to get it by statute.
In Wisconsin the Legislature has been called upon
to consider a bill for the promotion of matrimony,
but we regret to say the details of the bill have never
been sent to this coast. The Wisconsin solons appear
to have kept it quiet as a local monopoly, and doubt
less intend to get it copyrighted if it works well. Dela
ware legislators were too much taken up with the
Senatorial deadlock to do much, but they found time,
nevertheless,. to debate a question of admitting to the
whipping-post wives who beat their husbands, the
object of the bill being to give to husbands the same'
protection against ill-treatment at home that is given
to wives. Connecticut has discussed the advisability
cf establishing punishment at the whipping-post for
wife-beaters and kidnapers, and the chief argument for
it has been that if the punishment were provided it
would never be necessary to put it into practice, as
the class of people who would be liable to its penal
ties would leave. the Stste and go to New York.
In New Hampshire there has been an effort to
bring about reform in judicial proceedings by abol
ishing the Supreme Court and establishing in place of
it two courts of five Judges each, one to have final
jurisdiction on questions of law and the other on
questions of Fact. Here again we miss details and
arc not aware what forces arc back of the reform,
what arguments have been given to sustain it, or what
the Supreme Court has done to lead to the demand
for its immediate suppression. It has indeed been
suggested in a vague sort of way that the railroads
are supporting it with the desire to clear a way for
the reorganization of the Supreme Court in railroad
interests, but that explanation" must not be too eagerly,
accepted. It is to be remembered that'in New Hamp
shire they attribute to railroad influences everything
from the defeat of Senator Chandler to the condition
of the weather.
Before the New York Assembly there is a bill giv
ing the State Board of Health full power to regulate
the type and the leads of all publications from news
papers to books, the object being to prevent the pub
lication of anything in type so small or blurred as to
cause injury to the eyes of readers. It is an.interest
ing bill and we should like to see it tried outâ in New
York.

CURIOSITIES OF LEGISLATION.
..In considering the value of this tribute to Lincoln's
character it is to be borne in. mind that Sir Edward
Malet during his long career in the diplomatic service
of his country came into contact with all the great
men of the generation that is now passing away. He
knew Gladstone, Bismarck, Thiers, Beaconsneld and,
in short, all the statesmen,, warriors and rulers of
Europe and America. His tribute to Lincoln is there
fore worthy of remembrance. It is an evidence that
the memory that Americans so dearly love and vener
ate is held in an almost equal reverence by the best
minds of all nations.'
Speaking of Lincoln, Sir Edward Malct says: "OÂ£
all the great men I have known he is the one who
has left upon me the impression of a sterling son of
God.-. Straightforward, unflinching, not loving the
work he ihad to do, but facing it with a bold and
true heart; mild whenever he had a chance; stern as
iron when the public weal required It* following a bee
line "to the goal, which duty, set before him. I can still
feel the grip of his massive hand and the searching
look of his kindly eye."
LINCOLN'S PERSONALITY.
SIR EDWARD MALET, after a career of forty
one years in the British diplomatic service, has
retired to lettered ease and is now engaged in
writing his memoirs. The first volume, which has
just been published" is of interest to Americans, for
it deals with the period when Sir Edward was attached
to the British Ministry at Washington and refers to
many notable men of our country during the civil
war, chief among them, of course, being Abraham
Lincoln. -
The love and veneration with which Americans re
gard the memory of Lincoln are so intense that our
judgments of his personality are inevitably colored by
them; consequently there is always something to b
gained by noting how the great President appeared
to the representatives of other nations who watched
him from a standpoint radically, different from our
own. It is gratifying to note that in .this, instance
the testimony of the foreign critic is in strict accord
with the feelings of Americans.
Such being the case there is every reason to expect
from the liberality of Californians a prompt response
to the appeal for subscriptions to the monument
fund. Where many jnvc something it will not be
necessary for any one to give much. Moreover, from
the very nature of the object of the movement it is
desirable that the subscriptions come from the general
mass of the people and represent the popular senti
ment of the State rather than that of comparatively
a few men. It is in that spirit the movement for the
erection of the monument' has been undertaken, and
the public response should be prompt, cordial and
liberal.
The memory of Senator White's illustrious life is
fresh in the minds of all. Death has cleared away
from him all the clouds of partisanship, and men of all
parties can now perceive the full proportions of his
statesmanship. Xo one will now question that in the
United States Scnr.te he gave to California a. prestige
:n great debates inferior to that of no other State in
the Union, nor will it be denied that hiÂ« service there
was devoted to noble ends and animated by a genuine
patriotism.
Stately monuments erected to great men are some
thing more than adornments to cities. They serve
a purpose beyond that of pleasing the eye and gratify
ing an esthetic taste. They stand as object lessons in
patriotism. They remind men 0/ the value of a life
that is not lived solely for self. They recall to stran
gers the deeds of the great men to whose memory
they "have been erecteJ. They attest the existence in
the community of a spirit that rightly appreciates
patriotism and genius, and thus tend not only to the
ennoblement of the community itself but to an in
crease of its reputation abroad.
No man has more fully illustrated the genius of
California than Stephen M. White. Richly endowed
by nature with everv faculty that is essential to suc
cess in life, he devoted his energies less to his personal
adrancement than to public affairs and the general
good of the commonwealth. He sacrificed much of
individual advantage in the service of the public, and
set an example which will long be an Â¦ incentive to
roble natures. Califdrnians can hardly render any
more lasting service to their State than by the erec
tion of a monument which will impress upon the
minds of young men through all generations to come
the lessons of his earnest and useful life.
CALIFORNIANS of all parties have doubtless
noted with pleasure the steps taken to raise by
public subscription a monument to the memory
of Stephen M. White. The movement is one which
appeals to the general sympathies of the people. The
monument will be not only a memorial of a great
man but a manifestation of the liberality of Califor
nians in the recognition of true merit

After glancing at heredity in a general
way and appreciating the force of some
of its leading laws, we come more natu

applied to such fortunate individuals as
are born' strong, have an unquestioned
birthright of health and a reasonable as
surance of longevity. It must be natu
rally expected that the long-lived Indlvld
ual has .certain physical characteristics
which distinguish him from his less for
tunate fellows. These peculiarities make
themselves " evident . in different degrees
and In various ways, and give him a cor
respondingly hopeful outlook for the fu
ture.
Characteristics of Longevity.
While it must be admitted that acquired
tendencies are not strictly hereditary. It
must be likewise assumed on general prin
ciples that the vast majority of trans
mitted traits are due to distinct and in
herent qualities In the parents. Environ
ment thus has Its influences in fostering
or repressing such germlnative elements
as are born in the individual.
Take, for instance, the law of natural
selection, in marriage, which is of such
interest in connection with the particular
subject under discussion. Civilization, as
at - present cultivated,' tends strongly,
through loose marriage' customs, to un
dermine the very foundations of many of
our hopes for strong men and women In
future generations. The law of natural
selection on the proper basis of health
ful, prosperous and happy matrimonial al
liances is so often violated by custom,
convenience, wealth and social position,
that the question seldom occurs as to the
physical or mental qualities of the par
ties to the awful contract. The breeder
of dog, horse or cow is more careful on
the question of healthful and suitable
pedigree than the ever-watchful parents
who wish to mate their. son or daughter.
"Wrong judgment in this particular is sure
to tell on hereditary influences, and in
its turn to militate against longevity in
the offspring. Especially is this the case
when by unsuitable matches disease ten
dencies are multiplied and their propaga
tion through successive generations is
proportionately guaranteed. The Inter
marriage among even distant members of
the same family has always been fraught
with disaster by accentuating undesirable
traits. This has been shown over and
over again by the marriage of cousins,
especially in isolated country districts, in
which the infusion of new blood seldom
occurs. The unusual number of imbeciles
and "queer", people in such localities is a
matter of common observation. Such con
ditions always explain in certain strains
of given families a marked predisposition
to - special diseases and a corresponding
lowering of hereditary strength.- It must
be admitted that the Influences of en
vironment must te.good or bad in so far
as they attempt to control* unfavorable
heredity on the one hand, or allow evil
tendencies to work their worst on the
other.
Natural- Selection in Marriage.
Nature, when she has full sway, is al
ways on the sldo 0/ perfection. The model
man or model woman she seeks to pre
serve; it is the endurance of the species
at the expense of the individual, and the
perpetuation of the type against its oc
casional variation. Hence the "survival
of the fittest" Is the doctrine which she
preaches to all creation. The influences
of faulty environment are the only ones
which tend to thwart her purposes.
Therein oftentimes are many antagonisms
to her fundamental laws.
From what has been already Intimated
the estimation of the influences of hered
ity depends wholly upon what has gone
before. When It is considered that both
parents constitute the equation of chances
for the offspring it can be easily seen how
much depends upon a proper selection of
leading factors at the start. Thus the
strong father oftentimes offsets a weak
mother, and contrariwise a strong mother
is negatived by a feeble father. There is
a constant interchange of leading quali
ties which are mixed in due proportions
by_ elective and balancing affinities. Some
times these attributes adapt themselves
In such compensating ways that the re
sults make a happy culmination of desira
ble products, cither in the direction of
increased physical power, extra mental
force or Improved personal character.
Darwin proved this to be possible by his
exhaustive researches In evolution, and
Galton in his admirable work on "Hered
itary Genius" still further confirms the
theory.
tions. Environment is the evolutionary
force ' which always modifies the- typical
qualities. Although type as auch always
prevails in the end, its accidental varia
tions are always present. These latter
are really acquired habits, due to the
casual stimulation of dormant or latent
qualities which, save for favoring cir
cumstances of propagation, might prac
tically cease to exist.
The fighting force, however, is by.no means com
mensurate with the numbers. Most of the millions in
Russia are ignorant and poor. They are not contented
with their lot nor devoted to their Government. Of
any army Russia might raise it would be necessary
to keep most at home to prevent insurrections. In
fact, neither Great Britain nor Russia is at present
ready for a struggle for Asian supremacy. There is
friction at Tientsin, but we may be sure that at Lon
don and St.; Petersburg there is champagne, dip
lomacy and best of good intentions to'keep the peace.
Since Bismarck made that mocking comment on
the hereditary feud between. the Saxon and the Slav
times have changed and the relations of Great Britain
and Russia have changed 'with them.. The two nations
have so extended their empires that they are now al
most in contact. The British can strike at Russia in
Siberia and Manchuria, and Russia can strike at the
British in India. -Therefore if the fight should come
off it would very likely^ be a big one and would stretch
farther than any other war in the history of the world.
extending over almost the whole of Asia from the
Persian Gulf to the Japan Sea. It would set the races
and mbes moving from "the Ganges to the icebergs."
Russia does not take a census with anything like
the accuracy that marks such work by other great na
tions. In fact, it would be impossible to do so. Con
sequently estimates 01 her population and wealth are
largely matters of guesswork. Something can be
learned of the empire, however, from a recent pub
lication of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which
places the total population at 136,000,000, including
86,000,000 Russians, 9,000,000 Poles, 6,000,000 Finns,
6,000,000 Lithuanians, 4,000,000 Hebrews, 1,000,000
Germans and H,ooo,.xx3 of various tribes in' the Cri
mea, the Volga, the Caucasus and Siberia.
Years ago, when Disraeli halted the Russian ad
vance on Constantinople and there was prospect of
immediate war, Bismarck said the contest would, not
amount to much, for i* would be like a fight between
an elephant and a whale. Russia could. not get at
Britain nor could Britain get at Russia, arid in com
parison with the gigantic wars of the nineteenth cen
tury between other nations the whale fight with the
elephant would hardly be more than a circus.
ONCE more Russia and Great Britain are facing
one another in a situation that gives promise
of the outbreak of that final grapple between
them which. the world has so long expected. This
time it is not on the old historic ground around Con
stantinople, but on the far offEastern shores of China.
It is not now a question of the sickTurk, but of the
Mongolian. To that extent the quarrel has changed,
but otherwise it remains the/ same old question as to
which power is to be dominant in Asia.
ELEPHANT AND WHALE.
It will make the canal not only sure but its comple
tion speedy, and if President McKinley's last admin
istration do nothing else to imbed it- in history â¢ as
great, this coup will be sufficient.
Compared to the petty squabbling that has dis
gusted the nation this will be a stroke of statesman
ship on a scale of grandeur and usefulness to which
this country has heretofore been a stranger. . :;.,'.^
We do not hesitate to say that this bold and bent
ficial stroke is the equal of the great coup of Disraeli,
when he bought for England a majority of the Suez
canal stock and made her the chief owner in that
waterway.
The set purpose of the administration to build an
isthmian canal will be put out of reach of further mis
representation, and Congress will have nothing to do
but pull one administration string or the other and
go ahead with the work.
The cost of operating will be greatly less than that
of the lockage system necessary on the Nicaragua
route, and therefore the profits will be greater.
Parallel with this plan runs the intention to negotiate,
if possible, with Great Britain the abrogation of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty. So that, when Congress
meets the desire of demagogues to twist the lion's
tail will have to go unsatisfied. The administration
can then present the two plans, measuring one against
the other, and the agitators who have toiled to put
it in a false position will be disappointed of their
Prey. â¢
There are indications t that Colombia is willing, and
President McKinley dr.d Secretary Hay may shortly
open communication with her upon'th'e subject, with
the view of negotiating a treaty giving this country
a perpetual lease to the strip of 'land occupied, to be
compensated by a royalty on the proceeds of the
canal's operation. The rights of the French com
pany will be equitably extinguished, and for a sum
vastly less than the actual cost and value of the work
already, done.

It will be remembered". that there was a brief but
heated discussion last spring over the employment in
the Republican platfoim of the" term "isthmian" in
stead of "Nicaragua" canal. It is evident now that
the more general term was adopted and the more
specific one omitted with the wise and deliberate pur
pose of providing for just the emergency that has
arisen in the butchery of the Hay- Pauncefote .treaty
and the consequent arrest of proceedings under the
protocols with Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The ad
ministration has it in its power to have two strings
to its canal bow, and it will undoubtedly improve the
opportunity by a coup that will bring the canal in>
sight by rendering further sinister and indirect oppo
sition impossible.

Heredity in its broad sense* Is the birth
right of assured longevity. It Is what the
root is to the branch, the sap to the fruit.
A sound tree has as many offshoots under
ground "as above. The difference between
the oak and the mullein stalk Is. in degree
rather than kind. Each has a life law of
its own, and the conditions are not,con
vertible. The sturdy parent begets strong
offspring as surely as the seed grows its
kind.- Everything depends upon the proper
start; therein rests the chance of being on
the right side.
The only " composition of conditions is
in making the most of what we 'have.
Man at, best is the mere exponent of the
transient energy of the universe. . A
longer, or shorter period he exercises his
functions, and what 13 called life, vitality,
endurance, strength, snuffs out as a
candle. He feeds on just so much vital
ity and then is done. " His stock in trade
of life Is given at his birth, and his foun
tain never rises higher than its source.
Thus we have the strong and the weak
constitutions with .which, to strike the
balance of chances either for long and
healthy lives or short and sickly ones.
The seed produces its kind, and the en
vironment settles the question of soil.
The how and the why are questions which
are already settled when the account ; is
opened. Tne debit side Is a score of taints

Transmitted Vital Power.
Oliver^ Wendell' Holmes likens life to a
seventy-year clock, the key of which is
given to the angel of the resurrection. It
is simply a beautiful Illustration of na
ture's law, with a timpiece havlnll a
given number of years to run. It is the
limit of strain on the mainspring, and the
pulse-beat ' of ' the pendulum is the unerr
ing indicator of short or long service. In
otner words," there is just so much fuel for
the fire, burn It as we willâ the wood in
the beginning, ,the ashes in the end.
The essence of model heredity, is trans
mitted vital power. Every one whose at
tention has been directed to the subject
knows that certain families are long-lived
and others are not.
I recollect in my student days my old
preceptor used to give an illustration in
point by reference to an experience he had
with one of his earlier patients. There
was a severe railroad accident in a neigh-'
boring town and he was hastily sum
moned to aid the sufferers. While riding
thither the messenger was detailing the
frightful nature of some of the injuries,
but particularly those of the doctor's wait
ing patient. From all accounts the lat
ter was apparently beyond hope of pos
sible recovery. The doctor had so many
doubts on that score that he was wonder
ing whether or not he would find the pa
tient alive. "Certainly," responded his
informant. "Why, he la one of the Swan
familyâ belong to long-lived stockâ
couldn't kill him if you tried." And the
prediction of the neighbor proved if self
right.
These resisting qualities against shock
from injury â and collapse from, sickness
are, for the most part inherited rather
than acquired. It Is the protecting power
of the individual propagating Itself down,
tlio line of successive generations. It is
the law of life limit, as Immutable as the
relation of cause and . effect. Its proper
understanding and its satisfactory expla
nation implies a knowledge of ancestry.
"VV hen the parents and grandparents live
to a great age "the life expectation," as
the insurance companies use the term, is
proportionately favorable. The physician
always has this element of prognosis in
mind whwi he Inquires concerning the age
and the disease of the patient's ancestors.
"Who Shall Defend TJs From Our
Ancestors?"
Breeders of thoroughbred animals have
learned the importance of selecting pure
blooded stock on the same principle. Pedi
gree is everything with them. This con
viction is forced upon them by â¢ experi
ments founded on the strictly scientific
selection of parents. Unfortunately for
the human family, parallel conditions do
not exist in most of the up-to-date matri
monial ventures.
. With the advance of civilization and the
enervating influences which attend the
modern strain of living we seem to be
aiming at the survival of the unflttest
rather than at the true thing. In the
long .run, however, nature indicates her
rights in favor of the perfect individual
and the preservation of the species by
crowding the weaklings to the wall. She
is always on the side of law. power, right,
justice, discipline and â¢ soundness. Long
life Â«nd good health thus compass her
best gifts.. '
This po\rer of living is just as much an
inherited right as the size of the body, the
shape of the nose, the color of the hair
or the form of the skull. It Is the ex
pression of; consistency, of physical con
struction \with functional adaptability.
Thus strong vital" organsâ sound lungs,
healthy hearts, normal kidneys, active
livers and painless . stomachsâ all make
the sum total of the most desirable con
ditions of longevity. *When we admit thl3,
It is easy to understand why the trans
missible qualities of health or disease
are Â¦obviously dependent upon the an
atomical or organic elements which neces
sarily -overn and direct them.
Transmitted Features and Forces.
The conclusion is also irresistible that
as an organ is originally made,* so must
it work. This fact explains why one fam
ily may have its weak spot in the brain,
another in. the liver,: -stomach, kidney,
heart or any other, vital organ. .In other
words, these centers of vitality are in
capable^ by faulty construction of resist
ing the diseases which are constantly,
through climatic and other influences,
awaiting Â¦ opportunities . for Â¦ attack. - When
nature once delivers her goods there is no
'compromise. It Is once and for all, and
never on approval.
The strictly structural peculiarities
Â¦which are born with the individual are
those which are in turn transmitted to
the offspring. Logically this is as It
should ; be, ; showing, the direct influences
of ancestry as against those of merely ac
quired .habits after birth.

TO SUBSCRIBERS LEAVING TOWN FOR THE SUMMER.JUDGE HARRY A. MEI/VIN, WHO
IS HEARING THE TRIAL OF PE
TER McGIjADE.
THE third trial of Peter McGlade
on the charge of forgery â¢while ho
was chief deputy in the Street De
partment office was commenced
before Judge Harry A. Melvin of
Alameda County In Judge Cook's court
yesterday. Assistant District Attornej-
I)cuprey appeared for the prosecution and
the defendant was represented by Attor
ney Lennon.
The whole day was occupied with the ex
amination of trial Jurors and when court
adjourned, shortly before 5 o'clock, five
had been accepted to serve on the Jury.
They were Peter Anthers. Nathan Levy,
V. R. TTllman, Richard Tiddy and Charles
PRESIDENT McKINLET signified
by wire his approval of the pro
gramme for his reception and en
tertainment, which was placed
before him by the citizens' com
mittee of San Francisco.' The plans ac
cepted relate only to his sojourn In and
around San Francisco. It is understood,
however, that he will vlÃit Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara before he arrives in
this region of the State and will pay a
visit to Stockton and Sacramento after he
takes his final leave of San Franclscc*.
The President approves of the engragre
ments as announced above.
The executive committee for the Presi
dent's reception, Irving M. Scott, chair
man. Is thus constituted:
Claus Spreckels, chairman of citizens' com
mittee; W. F. Dohrmann, chairman of finance
committee: A. Sbarboro, chairman of decora-,
tlon committee; George A. Newhall. chair
man of committee on accommodation and la
dles' reception; Horace. Davis, chairman of
commltteo on University of California; Colonel
A. D. Cutler, chairman of committee of Grand
Army and Loyal Legion; John M. Gl eaves,
chairman of resident Ohio delegation; P. H.
McCarthy, president of Building Trades Coun
cil, chairman of committee on public reception;
General R. H. Warfield, chairman of commit
tee on parade.
. Each* chairman mentioned In the fore-
Koinp list will add to his committee the
number of â¢cltisens required to perform
the duties allotted to his committee.
It seems to be the sense of the execu
tive committee that decorations shall con
sist chiefly of American flags and Â¦ that
citizens may decorate their houses accord
ing to their, individual inclinations.
A man named Murray, who claims that
he represents an association of veterans,
sent an invitation to the President asking
the latter to meet ex-soldlere. .The in
vitation was .referred by the President to
the citizens' executive committe and Mur
ray-paid a visit to the committee to ob
tain recognition. He was informed that
the President had accepted an. invitation
to meet the veterans at Monterey. Mur
ray remarked that the Monterey meeting
was all right for veterans dwelling in the
country, but It would not apply to vet
erans in San Francisco. The plausible
Murray almost convinced the committee
that he was authorized to make reception
arrangements. Further inquiry, however,
convinced the executive committee that
the Grand Army of the Republic and the
Loyal Legion should name the represen
tatives^ the veterans. Accordingly Col
onel A. D. Cutler, a well-known mer
chant, a companion of the Loyal Legion
and commander of the George H. Thomaa
Post, Grand Army of the Republic, was
chosen.
against Thomas F. Hemmenway for
breach of promise. The jury impaneled
In the case brought In a verdict for the
defendant yesterday morning, thereby
holding that Hemmenway exercised his
right in the premises when he determined
that he had made a. mistake when he
asked Mrs. Barnes to become his wife.
The Southern Pacific Company proposes

their arguments on the fact that President
Hays has left the present general man

Woman Arnstcd by Captain
SÂ«ymour I? Released by
Ordtr of Judgo Fritz.'
The absurd story of a morning yel
low journal published yesterday giv
ing: a thrilling account of the attempt of
Mrs. Agnes Kent to poison her husband,
George Kent, by sending him a bottle of
whisky charged with arsenic through the
mails, yesterday fell as flat as dltchwater,
and Police Judge Fritz after an Investiga
tion promptly ordered Captain Seymour,
who Is also known as "chief of detec
tives," to release Mrs. Kent from Jail.
Captain Seymour on Tuesday night or
dered Detective Dillon to arrest Mrs. Kent
on a charge of having sent a bottle of
poisoned whisky through the mails to her
husband.
With a loud flourish of trumpets the
yellow Journal and Seymour claimed yes
terday that George Kent had stated that
he believed his wife had emulated the ex
ample of Mrs. Botkin and that he (Kent)
had escaped sudden death by not drink-
Ing from the arsenic-laden whisky.
Seymour said that he had evidence to
convict Mrs. Kent. "When Georgo
Kent appeared in the Hall of Jus
tice yesterday he had a long con
sultation with Seymour. Kent was then
prepared to swear that his wife had sent
him the poisoned whisky, but when ha
was questioned for a few minutes by. other
persons he weakened and said he would
not swear to a complaint against his wife.
Kent was brought before Police Judge
Fritz and asked by that official if ho
would swear to the complaint. Kent
stated that he did not believe his wife
had sent him the bottle of poisoned
whisky and Judge Fritz warmly stated
that he believed that Kent had mailed
the whisky to himself with Intent to In
jure his wife.
Judge Fritz immediately Â¦ ordered that
Mrs. Kent be released from custody and
Captain Seymour was forced to let the
woman go free.
Investigation yesterday showed that
there was not a particle of evidence
against Mrs. Kent. She is a hard-working
woman, who on account of her husband's
brutality was forced some weeks ago 'to
sue for a divorce. ' Her attorney asked
for $20 a month alimony and Kent, who
is a longshoreman, teared having to pay
this sum.
The address on the wrapper of the" bot
tle of. whisky which contained arsenic
was written in pencil. 'The name "George
Kent" was in one handwriting and the
address. "361 Clementina street, city," was
in a different style. Mrs. Kent says that
about a month ago she wrote her hus
band's name on a slip of white paper. as
he wanted to get a position and could not
write* his own name so that he could
furnish his' name to his prospective em
ployer.
There Is absolutely no doubt that the
slip of paper on which Mrs.* Kent wrote
the. name "George Kent" a month ago
was. used In the mailing' of the bottle of
whisky containing arsenic.
The conflicting stories' told by George
Kent as to the receipt of poisoned cakes
and candy in the past three months led
every one to believe that he had mailed
these articles to himself in hope of pre
venting hla wife securing alimony against
him.
With the refusal of Kent to believe that
his wife sent him the bottle of poisoned
whisky the whole story fell to the ground
and the opportunity of Captain Seymour
to shine as a new Vldocq has gone glim
mering.

City Engineer Grunsky filed a report
yesterday with the Board of Public Works
for transmission to the Board of Super
visors regarding the estimated cost of In
stalling a public system for lighting
streets and public buildings by electricity.
Ho fleures the cost of the Â¦whole system
at $1,375,390.
The report is accompanied by fifteen
drawings, which illustrate the proposed
constructions, plant and lighting: arrange
ments In detail. The plant Is projected to
furnish, beyond lighting requirements, the
power necessary to pump Bewage. under
the new system yet to be constructed and
also for elevator service. Â¦ Provision lls
ma-dc for 3000 arc and . 7000 incandescent
lights, an amount considerably greater
than the number now in use. There is
also provided to be held in reserve above
the requirements stated a capacity of 1000
Kilo watts.
The generating plant is to be estab
lished on the. shore at the foot of Fill
more street, upon a city lot extending
from Lewis to Tonquin streets, having
water communication by which supplies
may be conveniently received and also
water for condensing purposes. The
buildings and other arrangements for this
station are shown on the drawings, which
also show the locations of all street lights,
both arc and incandescent.
The distributing station is taken to be
at the City Hall and will be connected
with, the generating station underground.
The report contains comparisons of esti
mated cost of lighting. streets and build
ings with the actual cost as now paid by
the city " under â¢ contract, and with the
estimated cost under a proposition made
to the city by E. Brooke Ridley on August
14. 1900. .
There are also comparisons as to cost
of poles . and wires relative to a propo
sition made by the Independent Electric
Light and Power Company under date of
April 30, 1900, and covering the acquiring
by the city of the pole system used by

thÂ« International irritation over the situation
in Cliina and the prolongation of the South
African Â»Â»r. Sterlins exchange was called
firm during the Â« day In response to higher
money rates in London. There was no dis
turbance in the local money market notwith
standing the day's payment on account of sub
scriptions to the neWtrnion Pacific bond Issues,
calling for 210.0C0.roa. - **.
There was a further decline In the activity
>t prices were not th^ lowest, although proflt
taklnz wa* renewed .>u the advance, making
the closing tone irregular. The taking of
Fpeculaiive profits In Hurlincton was on an
enormous scale. There was determined support
In -the etock at the opening, but the utmost,
that could be secured for it was a half-point
advance. The opening price was the highest
and lt was steadily under pressure for the
rert of the day except for the covering move
ment by the shorts. The contest for change
of control of this road seems to have been
ineffectual, the competitive buying of Insiders,
which carried the- price to yesterday's high
level, having defeated the attempt. Yet the
recorded transactions In the stock within a
few days past have been much more than
â¢would be sufficient to change the control. -The'
highly speculative character of the dealings
is tcus clearly indicatc<l An effort was made
to FUbrtitute Bt. Paul for Xorthern Pacific as
market leaders and Missouri Pacific was
marked up very buoyaiitly to 101, crossing par
for the first time in many years. There was
a ftrong upward mot-ement in Brooklyn Tran
flt on rumors of official changes and on buying
of -the same character of Manhattan. The
Â«eei ttocks all continued strong, the dealings
being mostly m the trust certificates for de
l<Â«!ted etotk. as the time for deposit expired
to^dsy. As the euccc;s of the plan was ob
viously assured there was a final rush to de
posit stuck* bo that tne clerical difficulties of
the trawler make it probable . that delayed
deposits will be | leniently treated. The pre
ferred stocks showed greater strength, gains
?xlending to 4'*. Members of the group re
ccttd with the reet ot the market but re-
Fisted. There were eIsii* of an effort to chift
the speculations from railroads into indus

NEW YORK, March 2O.-The market was
overe-'.ie'.med with Belling orders during the
onurre cf to-day's tradiug and the phenomenon
occurred of an eager unloading of stocks by
e!arnv-d holders without any bad news bearing
on the value of their property to alarm them.
The t>ul! leaders attempted for a time to con
te*t thÂ« decline and co divert the speculation
inw new channels, but the market was ob
viously tired and res-K>nded languidly to the
manipulation for th* advance. Yesterday's
l-Â»avy j.rofit-taking brought further selling
nrrlTs through commiFsion-houses and the
r^ari". detreting the slralned conditions in the
market, put out larger thort lines. When the
bulls finally ceased *heir efforts to check the
decline pries crumbled rapidly and stop-loss

Small receipts of hogs and higher prices at
the yards for them gave a bullish tone to the
provisions market, where a further rise oc
curred, establishing a new high price record
for the season. Pork" was wanted, but there
was scarcely any on- the market save when
shorts raised their bids to a marked degree.
A good cash demand contributed to the ad
vance in futures. May pork left off 62Vfcc
over yesterday, lard Sc higher and ribs I^c
improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Corn responded very feebly to the bullish
Fplrlt of the wheat market at the opening.
The weather was regarded as bearish and re
ceipts continued to show improvement in grade.
May closed unchanged at 41%c.
Oats were dull. May closed a shade higher
at 2DUc
CHICAGO, March 20.â Irregularity and ner
vous excitement characterized tyie Wheat mar
ket to-day. May opened %@%c higher at 76'4
@76%c, mainly under pressure from shorts,
whose fears were aroused by the steadiness of
Liverpool cables, by cold weather and the
small total of Northwest receipts. Long wheat,
mostly from scalpers, came out In sympathy
with the easiness in corn and May reacted to
76Uc on a dull market. On scarcely any trade
and with no added reason for such action the
market quickly rallied to 76%c and then re
acted to 7SV4c At this point lt was reported
that English and Russian troops had fired at
each other at Tientsin and nervous shorts
rushed to cover, causing a rally to 77c. Real
izing sent it back to 76V4c. . but on the re
ported drop of 19 points In the condition df
Kentucky wheat and, ravages of fly in Texas
and further apprehension over the strained
relations between England and Russia, May
advanced again to 7714c. Profit-taking caused
a small fractional recession from this, but
the close was strong. %<@%c higher at 76%@77c.

Chicago opened Â¦ firmer on better foreign ad
vices and wintry weather. A report from
London that the Russians and British had flred
upon each other at Tientsin hardened the mar*
kec a little, and some crop damage talk from
Texas was another bullish factor. The com
mission houses sold on the swells, however,
shorts bflng the buyers. The Pillsbury-Wash
burn mills at Minneapolis reported orders for
flour to keep them running till May. Primary
receipts were 584,603 bushels, against 635,862 for

Heiiry Clews' New Tork circular says:
"There is a class cf operators (rather numer
cuj) Tvho teem almost unconscious of the ex
tent to which Wall Ftreet conditions have
recently become abnormal. It hardly strikes
them as a somewhat startling fact that within
the f.rst ten weks of the current year the
sale* of ttocks at the exchange have amounted
to 1Â£.ZO0.K<0 fhares. compared with 13.400,000
Fhares for the same wetks of 1900; while the
transactions in bonds have reached $232,700,000,
aÂ«tinÂ« SU'f.SOO.OOO a year ago. This enormous
expansion of transactions has occurred on a
rcale of prices 3u to 35 ]>oir.is above the pre
vious normal of valu>*s. So steady has the
markn become on this Immensely advanced
eca)<? of priefs that many uninitiated operators
take Â¦â¢.'.' this as n mati-r of course, assume that
the inflation has come to stay, cling to their
holding? and employ their profits for additional
purchases at still rising prices. I do not say
that this Borging prows may not be carried
to eti!! greater lengths without precipitating
immediate disaster, for there is no Baying into
what c-xcepses the present eanguine spirit
among untrained M>eeulators may not run,
and the amount of profits to the credit of
this o1e.sp of must afford them a
considerable fund for tlieir protection. Also,
it is to be conceded, so far as respects ratl
roa-1 investments, that for some years past the
fir-anres of those corporations have been lm
jirovir* to an extent Â¦which had not be*n fully
iÂ«?SectÂ«?d in the average tcale of market values;
fo that we may reasonably calculate upon * a
|K>rtion of the late great rise in prices being
l#nnanently retained. But it should never be
forgotten by the novitiates that the profes
rional operator has a keen and true eye for
joint where the outsider Is most sanguine. It
may be taken for granted that from this time
fenvard every further advance brings the situ
ation to much nearer the culminating point,
and that both reckless and pyramid buying
will BOwntr or later precipitate reaction."

NEW TORK, March 20.â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market suffered a general depres
sion to-day under the influence of the news
of both as ' declination of the terms offered
for peace in South Africa and of the definite
announcement that .Von Waldersee had, failed
to arrange the differences at Tientsin. Both
London and Paris sold consols short, but no
body takes a really serious view of the situa
tion, which undoubtedly will be settled am
icably. American snares began dull, but the
selling here was soon stopped by buying
orders from New York, especially In the Atch
isons. Union Pacifies and Southern railways.
A very steady Improvement ensued until at
the, close the rather ' bad news from China
caused the market to ease off.

The Eastern Improvement In Prunes has at
last reached this market and all dealers report
much more activity and rising quotations, with
the troublesome outside stock practically
cleaned up and out of the way. The market
is expected to do better from now on. Latest
mail reports from New York say: "There Is
little or no change In the spot situation In
dried fruits. Prunes still go out quite frefely
and holders generally are firm at quotations.
From the Coast there are some goods offer
ing from outsiders, it Is stated, on the 2%c

; The north is taking a good deal of Butter,
both fresh and packed, but the demand is ex
clusively for the best creameries. Dairy de
scriptions are neglected and ' rather weak than
otherwise. Stocks of Eggs are meager and
the demand is brisk, some dealers having to
go out on the street and buy to accommodate
their regular trade. 5 Large lines are being
placed in cold storage, and this is the causa
of the reduction In stocks.
Prices . for all three descriptions still stand

SAN DIEGO, March 20.-Immlgration
Inspector Dunn of San Francisco spent a
busy afternoon on board - the steamship
Belgian King, examining: the Chinese pas
sensers who are anxious to land, but
whose status he will thoroughly Investi
gate ' before permitting them to set foot
on American soil. It is the impression of
the Immigration Bureau that the examin
ations have been made so closely in San
Francisco, and so many Chinese have
been sent back, that' they have selected
the smaller ports of San Dlegro, Portland,
and Seattle as prospective landing places.
Each of the Chinese on the Belgian
King is provided with the necessary
papers and certificates, but it is evidently
the intention of the Immigration Depart
ment to discredit the certificates of the
American Consuls In China from the very
start and by cross-questioning the would
be immigrants prove that the Consuls'
certificates are frauds.

SEATTLE, March 20,â The nickel-in-the
slot bill passed by the Legislature has
been signed by Governor Rogers and will
become a law on June 1. One feature of;
it, which Is raÂ»t defended by many of its
most ardent friends. Is that Informers re
ceive half of the fines Imposed. Generally
speaking, the law Is very stringent. The
owner, agent, lessee or any one who
"plays" a machine may be arrested and
fined from $10 to $100. In default of pay
ment, a term -in the county Jail Is pre
scribed. The possession of a machine is
made prlma facie evidence of guilt.
SAN DIEGO, March 20.â An Important
ruling relating to juries in civil casea was
rendered by Judge Torrance of the Su
perior Court to-day. Ke held that tho
present practice, which is being followed
in this as well as in other counties of the
State, Is. not In accordance with the law
and that the statutes of 1371 and 1872,*
which provide that the county must pay
part of the expenses, are still in force.
The matter came up In the case of
Grace M. Neely vs. Minnie G. Stockton,
in which the question was presented to
Judge Torrance on Monday and was de
cided by him to-day. The defendant de
manded a jury trial, but the plaintiff
would not consent, because she 'was not
able financially to pay her share of tho
expense, it having Deen the rala of the
court for many years that In a civil Jury
case each side must advance half of tho
expenses as the trial progresses. This
custom has ben followed In all the Su
perior Courts of the State outside of San
Francisco for the past ten years.
This system was attacked by Attorney
Andrews, and Judge Torrance. by his de
cision to-day, practically declares It to
bo illegal. After citing a number of Su
preme Court decisions, he holds that tha
statutes of 1871 and 1372 are still In force.
These statutes provide that the party
in whose favor the verdict la rendered la
a civil case must pay the expenses of tha
twelve men who compose the Jury, whlla
the county must pay the expenses o2
those who are subpenaed but not accept
ed as Jurors.
In case the Jury is not able to agreo
upon a verdict the party to the suit de
manding the jury trial must pay the ex-.
penses of the Jurors. When a verdlet la*
rendered the Judgment ia not docketed
until the money has been paid for the
jury, but the amount so paid is taxed in
the costs of the suit In the Judgment.
Judge Torrance said he had some hesi
tation in coming to this conclusion, as
he knew the practice to be different
throughout the State. Judge Torrance
accordingly vacated the order setting the
case for trial on April 1, because he did
not feel justified in ordering a Jury for
this case alone If the county had to stand
part of the expense. He probably will
wait until there are three or four Jury
cases before he will set It for trial and
summon a jury.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
Judge Torrance Holds the
Statutes of 1871-72 Are
in Force.

The "Rats" had a most enjoyable time
for several hours and rumors were rife
concerning the antics of those initiated
Into the mysteries of the club. Many
fines were leyled on those who rubbed the

the spirit set forth in the mottoes of the
order, "We wish no one harm," and "We
try to do everybody good." The latter
phrase eeems enigmatical, but to the

The ups and downs of Burlington stock
mean much to Los Angeles, as they are
evidently influenced by the prospective
fate, not only of the Burlington road, but

pends now -solely upon the continuance
of the Burlington road In the hands of the
present owners and Independent of the
union Pacific and Vanderbilt interests. If
the Burlington were to pass into the con
trol of the people that have the Union
Pacific and the Southern Pacific It would
"knock" all projects of a new line to Salt
Lake that could in any way be considered
a competitor.
Construction of the. new road will begin
within thirty days. Several- thousand ties
are now at San Pedro and several car
loads of seventy-flve-pound rails are on
their way from Chicago. The articles of
transfer of the Terminal Railway proper

Many Witnesses Examined-
Whose Statements Fa
vor Jordan.
Expert Furnishes Tacts as to Condi
tion of the Current on the
Morning of the
Tragedy. i
The Investigation by the State Pilot
Commission, which is to determine to
what extent Pilot Frederick W. Jordan is
responsible for the sinking of the Rio de
Jar.eiro, was continued yesterday morn
ing. Numerous witnesses were examined
and all the testimony adduced, both of
expert navigators and of those who were
aboard the vessel when she struck the
fatal ledge, was most favorable to the
pilot.
One of the most Important points elic
ited during the day was that it has been
the inviolable rule of this port that when
a vessel is about to enter all the officers
shall be called on deck. On the morning
of the tragedy this rule was violated on
board the Kio.
The principal witness of the day was
CsptAln Wiiikel of the steamship Se
quoia, which entered port soon after the
Kio went down. He gave -testimony not
brought out by otner investientions,
showing the conditions of the current and
of the weather at the time of his
entrance. .
Tilt captain testified that his vessel
passed Point Bonita at 6:40 o'clock and at
that time he could see the lights at the
point, which in his judgment were about
t-ix miles distant. When he reached Point
Diablo a dense tuie fog hung over the
water and rendered it impossible to see
more than the length of the boat.
On that morning, he testified there
was such a swift current rushing through
the dolden Gate that it was impossible to
hold the vessel to her course even when
going at full speed. His vessel, although
directed toward Lime Point, was carried
within one hundred yards of the Fort
Point buoy by the velocity of the current-
Captain John von Helms, the next wit
ness, furnished expert testimony showing
that whistles cannot be relied upon dur
ing the prevalence of a heavy fog. He
stated that the round is often obstructed
and that sometimes instead of directing
they enly serve to mislead. According to
the captain the bell at Fort Point has
been a source of complaint since its estab
lishment, as it is in a box beneath the
wall, and its position renders the tones
indistinct. In his opinion the bell should
be suspended at the top of the fort and
the whistle at Lime Point should be
transferred thither. The captain testified
that the lead Is seldom used along the
coast except when a vessel Is passing
through shoal water. Even then, he said,
it cannot be relied upon to protect from
dangerous ledges, as the water just off
from the ledge is sometimes thirty feet in
depth.
Captain Maiiiews of the transport ser
vice. Second Officer Coghlan, Chief Engi
neer Herlihy, Quartermasters Lindstrom
and Matthewson and R. H. Long, a pas
senger aboard the Rio, were also exam
ined.
The Inquiry will be continued to-morrow
morning.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
Major Harney made his last appoint
ment at the meeting of the Harbor Com
missioners yesterday and also made all
his arrangements for turning his office
over to his successor as soon as he is ap

resigned his position as wharfinger at
Channel street and Major Harney ap
pointed Emile Francoeur to fill the va
cancy. He also appointed David Fox as

Chief. "Wharfinger" Henderson reported
that a berth at Harrison-street wharf
could not be given the Koemos line, as
the transport service was using the
structure. The commission promised to
provide accommodation for the company
before the next steamship arrives from
Hamburg.
The chief engineer reported that the
proposed extension of Washington and
Mission street wharves 200 feet into the
bay would cost about $S0OO each, without
the cost of preserving the piles.

BÂ»rach two months ago asked for a rebate

PILOT COMMISSION
HEARS TESTIMONY
BERKELEY, March 20.â The question of
the costumes of envoys was the feature
of John W. Foster's lecture on diplomacy
this afternoon at the university.
"In the early years of the republic,"
said ' Mr. ' Foster; "the envoys wore left
free to wear the dress best suited to them.
The first authotlzed use of costumes was
during the peace negotiations after our
second war with England. In 1817 this
Government issued a circular fixing the
style of an elaborate uniform. - In 1S33
Marcy, then Secretary of State, issued a
circular declaring that the dress of Amer
ican representatives should ; be the sim
ple dress of an American citizen. This cir
cular created a nutter In court circles,
especially, In England, where it was wide
ly ridiculed. Â¦ The 'simple Â¦ dress of an
American . citizen' has, - however, become
the dress of American diplomats. -'
"The section In the Federal constitution
forbidding tha acceptance by any Amer
ican representative of gifts from a foreign
nation early stopped the practice of mak
ing and receiving costly presents. It has
not, however, done away with the trou
blesome practices of offering decorations
of orders to Americana. In spite of our
boasts of republicanism, there is a wide
spread desire In our country to secure
from a foreign country the badge of some
order, the gewgaw of a monarch. It is
estimated in Europe that one man In
every 300 wears. the ribbon of some order.
The people from California who recently
distinguished Themselves at Paris and
have been investigated by the Legisla
ture are reported to have been decora'ted
by the cross of the Legion of Honor.
Should they show the red ribbons in pub
lic you want to know that there are 500,
000 other persons entitled to the same
privilege of wearing them."
Mr. Foster will continue his lecture to
morrow afternoon.

When asked regarding the report that
he had said in an Eastern address a few
days aeo that if the present conditions
continue there would be an emperor 'in
Washington In twenty-five years, Presi
dent Hadley said: .
"That -was a mistake' on the part of! a
reporter. The address was extemporan
eous, but as nearly as I can remember
this is what I said: 'People will expand
their ideas of self-government as our
problems' expand: If they did not we
should have an emperor In Washington In
twenty-five years.' The part about the
emperor. was merely thrown in as a force
ful way of showing that the country must
be governed by public opinion. It is rath
er useless to deny that I did not make the
statement; the more I deny it the more
the people seem to remember It.

A suit bristling: with â¢ sensational
charge* a.n-,1 lmputlngr sharp practice to
Of-orgB N. Williams, t prominent attor
ney of this. city, was filed late yesterday
a-fternoon !n the. office of the County
Clerk. The euit. whicii involves property
valued at about SSO.WO. the principal part
of which is located on bush street, near
Ooujjh. grew out of the contest of the wili
of the late Mrs. Marv Shores.
The deceased, during the lifetime of her
former husband. John S. Dolllver, made
a will leavlnc all her property to Mrs.
Mary IHistln. then residing in New York;
James P. Blake of Harrison, Maine. anÂ«l
James W. Richardson of Washington. D.
C. Subsequent to making this will Mrs.
DoIIlver soured a divorce from her hus
band and married Leander Shores. When
the died about a year ago Shores demand
ed letters of adminisratlon on the ground
that she had died intestate and that her
marriage to htm had nullified the will
which was made during the lifetime of
her former husband. His contentions
were recognized by Judge Troutt and tnc
letters of adminisration were accordingly
issued to him.
The typhews of the decear-ed determined
to institute a contest to recover the prop
erty which had been willod to them by
their aunt. Their claims were considered
by the legal fra-ternity to be based upon
such poor grounds that it was with the
greatest difficulty that r. lawyer was in
ouced to undertake the contest. Many.
after examining the statutes, refused un
der any consideration to have anything to
do with it. The case was linaiiy submit
ted to Williams and hÂ» consented to make
the contest on condition that he be al
lowed one-third of whatever property he
xnieht succeed in recovering. His terms,
although distasteful to one of the content â¢
ants, Mrs. Mary Dustin. were finally ac
cepted. Suit was instituted with the re
tult that the will was declared valid and
the property was awarded to the nephew- s
and Mrs. Dustin.
When Mrs. Mary Dustin, James P.
Blake and James W. Richardson found
themselves in undisputed possession of
the inheritance they resolved to ignore the
contract which they entered into with At
torney George N. Williams, hence the in
stitution of the present suit to declare the
contract null and void.
Williams was interviewed a"t his homo
in Alameda last night. Ke said:
"Mrs. Shores died in San Francisco,
leaving a surviving husband, but no chil
dren, no brothers nor sisters. She had
been previously married and divorce-}.
Prior to the divorce from her former htw
band ske had made a will In which eho
deeded her property t" the children of her
brother and sisters. It was claimed that
her subsequent marriage to Mr. Shores
operated as a revocation of this wilt.
Shores applied for letters of administra
tion of her estate as in a case of intes
tacy, claiming' to be her sole heir at law. .
"Under these conditions the plaintiffs in
this suit employed me as their attomey
to establish the will executed by her pre
vious to her marrtagre to Shores. Thev
preferred to make my contract contingent
upon success, which was fixed at what
ever might be recovered. I performed my
part of the contract and recovered thÂ«
estate for them. They reDudlated their
part of the contract and I suppose that
'n the suit, the complaint of which I have
not yet read, it is alleged that I have
taken advantage of them. I deny th-s
charge in any form.
"I suppose that they claim that I should
have revealed to them the ETounds upon
which I hoped to succeed. I thought and
ttilJ think that I was not obliged to do
trJat until they liad accepted ' my employ
ment."

day wept bitter :tears. V The horse was
adorned by a beautiful sweeping tail. Mr.
Healy yesterday drove the animal to To
males, and while he was transacting hia
business In the house of. a- farmer thÂ©
horse was hitched in the stable. Â¦
Now In that stable there was a young 1
calf. The youngster was of an inquisitive
turn of mind. Hardly had Healy left the
buiiding ' when Â¦ the calf be?an a critical
survey -ot> the horse."*" After a close
pcrutiny-lt picked. upon the beautiful tail
of the horse as worthy of 'Â¦ its attention.
When Mr. Healy returned, to the barn he
found his fine roadster shorn of half of
its 'ulterior, adornment.* -The calf' had
chewed -off ; all Â¦ the?; hair -and "only the
stump remained q unscathed.

of Harbor Commlpsloners to authorize the
payment to the petitioners of $1800, the

the Harbor Commissioners filed their an
swer to the petition for the writ and de
fended their refusal to pay the amount
named on the ground that the petitioners,
in violation of the State law. worked their
men over eleht hours a day. and in such
case? the law compels the board to with
hold payment.
On June 19 last the petitioners were
awarded the contract to furnish the build-
Ing at a cost of $2750. It was aereed that
th* work was to be paid for ln full within
thirty-five days after its completion. The
contractors were paid $950 on account, and
then the board, on the ground that the
petitioners had violated the. terms of Iheir
contract, refused to -pay. the balance due.

OAKLAND. March 20.â Theodore En

a half at 1131 East Twenty-second street.
Oakland. :Hecame to Oakland . from San
Francisco, where he formerly kept a gro
cery and saloon at the corner? of Ninth
and Mission streets. About three years
ago â¢ he went to Alaska., but did- not re
main long. = Monday he went tf> San Fran
cisco and opened a new store in the "West
cm Adoltion, San Francisco. He was re
puted to be quite wealthy. Enderle was
married and his wife and two children
survive him. Mrs. Enderle went to San
Francisco to-day to see Â¦ the new store.
She had not yet been heard from at a
late hour to-night. Deceased was a man
of cheerful disposition and temperate
habits. . His home life was happy and his
business affairs prosperous.
. The second suicide was also a German.
about 45 years of age. He had dark
brown hair and mustache and- wore a
dark suit of ; clothes slightly threadbare.
Both bodies were removed to .the Morgue.
I am out of emsloyment and sick. I can

forelve me: I cannot help it. Try to llv<Â»

Two men, weary of care and trouble,
wandered out ' to . a lonely spot in the
Presidio reservation yesterday or Tues
day night and put an end to their earthly
sufferings.
The two unfortunates were strangers to
each other, and whichever one was last
to cut short . his existence was probably
unaware that the lifeless body of another
unfortunate lay on the ground close by.
Theodore Enderle.a grocer at the cor
ner of Bush and Buchanan streets, and
who resided in Oakland, sought oblivion
in the poison cup for a reason still to be
learned.
The other victim, whose body is yet un
identified, after having written a note in
which he said that Illness and lack of
employment drove him to despair, blew
out his brains with a pistol bullet. He
signed the message but it is ad
dressed to no one and leaves no clew as
to his identity. .
Yesterday afternoon, mounted soldiers
stumbled upon the body of Enderle. Be
side It lay a bottle of carbolic acid and
a glass from- which the lethal fluid had
been drunk. , There was no letter giving
a reason feu* the man's rash act. and his
relatives are mystified. A short time ago
Enderle purchased a grocery store at the
corner of I Bush and Buchanan from
Smeckpepner & Herzberg. and has since
been conducting the business. He had
plenty of money and owned considerable
property in this city and across the bay.
He was a German. 42 years of age.
As some of the soldiers passed on they
came upon the body of the unknown man,
with a pistol an* a note beside It. The
remains lay near the McDowell road and
were but a few rods from where Enderle's
body. lay. The note read as follows:
Two Unfortunates Seek the
Same Spot m Presidio to
Commit Suicide.

which* has found Â¦ much favor with Alca

fair, with an old Dlot under "a new face
Instead of in a .fountain, of youth sur
rounded by Bleepleps dragons.-an old man
imagines that he discovert? a*, specific for

P^TT^ HE Tlvoll opened .on Monday
Â¦ M evening with the bright little
I opera of Stange and Edwards.
yL "The Wedding Day." The popu
lar little theater has outdone It
self in giving the production. "The.Wed
dlng Day." to begin with, is a tuneful,
wcli-constructed opera, musically satis
factory, and with bright lines and amus
ing situations galore. It is prettily cos
tumed, the stage setting is distinctly
above the average, and the opera goes
with unusual snap and vim. The orches
tra is happily handled by the new leader.
Paul Stelndorff, who has a satisfying grip
on the baton, and not for many months
have the choruses, solo accompaniments
and Intermezzos gone with such admir
able spirit and precision. The Tivoli
management has indeed been fortunate in
securinK so able a leader.
All the Kddy street favorites are well
cast in the play. Ferris Hartman is an
abundantly satisfying figure as Polycop,
the newly married baker, whose wedding
day is illustriously celebrated. Alf C.
Wheelan is admirable as < the meddlesome
apprentice of Polycop, Planchette. Ed
ward Webb Is an excellent Due de Bouil
lon, the mercurial amorist a la mllltaire,
and Arthur Boyce is well heard as Raoul,
thft tenor nephew of the Duke..
. Of the women Annie Meyers is a chic
and sprightly Mme. Folycop â demure,
also, as befits the part. Maude Williams
sings sweetly the role of Lucile d'Herb
lny. and looks charming, and Bernice
Hclmes Is a stately and ' melodious '
Madame do Montbazon. The Don Giovan
ni catalogue song of Hartman is much en
joved. but might be shortened a little to
advantage, and a very clever arrange
ment of the "Mermaid and the Whale"
song and chorus gives much pleasure.
Some of the ensembles show the weight
of the new hand, more particularly, the
cleverly worked out finale to the second
act.
â¢ ' â¢ â¢
The Sembrich Opera Company at the
Grand Opera-house has experienced a
slight setback in the temporary indispo
sition of the prima donna. Mme. Sembrich.
"La Traviata," that was to be given last
evening,, has had to be postponed until
next Monday night, to allow of a suffi
cient rest for the singer, who will, how
ever, certainly appear on Saturday after
noon next In "Don Pasauale." The old Â¦
Donizetti opera has not been heard here
for many years, and Mme. Sembrich'a
Norina is awaited with much pleasurable
anticipation. Next, week's programme
win be: Monday evening. , "Traviata";
Wednesday evening, "Lucia." and a Sat
urday matinee, for which the opera has
not yet been announced.
â¢ â¢ ' â¢
. La Loie Fuller is in the last nights of
her successful engagement at the Colum
bia Theater, arid her charming terpslcho
rean efforts are still delighting good
houses. "The Highwayman" goes better
than it did. and will give place next â¢week
to the Frohman production of "The Little
Minister.", a dramatization of the novei
of the name by J. M. Barrie himself.
"The Little Minister" had an exceptional
run In New York, and the play is.saJd-to
be one of the" prettiest and wholesomest
plays now on the stage. ;
