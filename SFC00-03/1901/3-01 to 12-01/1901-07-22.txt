THE closing session, of the Interna

The song service was under the direction
of Robert Husband. The spirit manifest?

the first speaker. He said in part: I

THE four days' cessions of the In
ternational Epworth League conven-.
tion came to a brilliant close at the
Pavilion last night. The meetings
of the convention have been fruit
ful of happy results, and there is a'
unanimous sentiment among the thou-
Fands of delegatPB that at no previous
meeting of the International League have
the exalted purposes of that great Chris
tian organization been so thoroughly sub
rerved as at this. The enthusiasm whicft
marked all of the gatherings, the variety
of subjects treated by a galaxy of pulpit
speakers of distinguished attainments, the
/unexampled reception accorded the vis
itors by the people of San Francisco, the
Fuperb weather which prevailed during
the week, *n<J which was in such marked
contrast with the torrid temperature
In the Bast, all these contributed"
In an eminent degree to render the expe
riences of last week a chapter in the lives
of the leaguers which they appreciated
highly and which they are not likely soon
to banish from their memories.
While the convention came to a formal
close last night, there will be attractions
of sufficient variety during the next three
days to prevent a general hiatus east
ward until the close of the week. The
Pavilion will remain open to-day and to
morrow In order that the visitors may in
epect the numerous exhibits and displays
which have beÂ«i no insignificant feature
at last week's great event. Many, of the
leaguers, absorbed as they were with their'
duties as members of the convention,
heretofore lacked opportunity to Inspect
the exhibits, and It Is to allow them this
privilege that the general committee re
solved to keep the Pavilion open to the
public for the two days a* stated. The
exhibits are excellent ones, and are well
worthy of the careful attention of all
who "are interested in the development of
the magnificent resources of California.
The numerous side trips arranged by
the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Rail
way companies for this week will be well
patronized. Hundreds of tickets for the
Yosemlte. Monterey, San Jose "and other
interior points have been sold, the buyers
being principally members of the league.
The benefits to be derived from these
Journeys will evidence themselves Jn the
future, and will serve to advertise th!j
State throughout the East In a most
practical manner. .
While many of the delegates will leave
for the East to-day and to-morrow, there
will be a. sufficient number remain until
the close of the week to make their pres
ence in the community felt If the expres
sion* of admiration for California heard
at the convention headquarters are gen
uine, hundreds of the leaguers will at an
early day make this city their home. .

No German Leaguers Meeting.
A German-American meeting was an

as to the hour, or'for some unexplained
cause, the meeting was not held. At 3

J. M. Churchill of Coldwater.* Ontario,
had for his theme "What is Wanted by
Boys and What is Wanted In Them." His
address was filled with amusing incidents
from his own experience, and was In con
sequence greatly enjoyed by the young
people. Purity, he declared, is one of the
most exalted virtues that a boy can pos
sess. He likened a boy with a pure mind
and heart to a lily growing in a polluted
stream. He advised the boys to take
Christ for their model in the formation of
their character, and to be serious and
zealous in performing their work in life.
"How to Build a Character" formed the
text of the remarks which were made by
the Rev. C. O. Jones, D. D., of Bristol.

speech he argued that it Is essential that
a boy should have not only a definite de

sire.

Delegates to the Efcworth League convention last night adopted the following resolutions,, which
had been reported by the resolutions committee:
OUR coming to the Pacific Coast hat
been to us a series of revelations and
of unmixed pleasures. We had heard
much of the goodly land, and the
great city of the Golden Gate. . but
half had not been told us. . May the
bountiful Lord -who has so lavished
his. blessings of earth and air and
sky upon this great people make them a
thousand times, as many more, and as
mighty, for Himself and for humanity.
' " RESOLVED.
1. That the hearty thanks of the conven
tion are due and hereby tendered to the
various committees of arrangements for the
ample and admirable preparation made for
cur renting, ana for the cordial, unremit
ting ajK efficient services rendered us dur
ing our stay nmong them.
2. We cannct refrain . from mentioning
with special appreciation the herculean
labors performed by the- Rev. Thomas Fil
ben, D.P., chairman of the general com
mittee of arrangements.
3. The skill with which the heads of the
various .departments of administration have
performed . their duties has elicited our
warmest admiration.
i. We cordially thank the State and City
officials, the business men and the citizens
of San Francisco generally for the great in
terest they have shown in the success of
tho convention. Â¦-....
, 5. We appreciate the hearty co-operation
with the various committees of the conven
tion of the members of the Young People's
Society of the Christian Endeavor' and the
Baptist Young People's Union.
6. "We have, been greatly delighted with
the enterprise ehown . by the daily press of
the city. For the full reports of the ad
dresses delivered and the sympathetic treat
ment of all features of the gathering, j we
.render our grateful acknowledgments.
7. We especially appreciate the cordial
greeting sent to us by President McKinley
and Vice President Roosevelt, and. eight
Governors of States; and we invoke God's
blessing upon these eminent public servants,
and upon all others In civil authority.
. 8. To the various railroads, steamship and
other transportation companies we extend
our hearty thanks for most liberal and uni

9. We must not forget to mention Mrs.
Stanford's great kindness in permitting the
use of the splendid organ built for Stanford
University and to cordially thank Mr. Hus

cial helpfulness in the service of song.
.. missions. . â¢
Â¦ 1. We rejoice in the deepening â¢ Interest
among our members in the great cause of
Christian missions, and congratulate our
organizations, here represented, Â¦Â¦Â¦ upon the
educational work which has already 'been
accomplished. We are greatly delighted by
the comprehensive and practical plans
which have been devised by our leaders
for a great campaign in behalf of
missions and other benevolences during the
comlns.year. We urge all our chapters to
Increased study . of missionary . literature,
and to fervent prayer for the coming of the
kingdom. Â¦ â¢ â¢
"2. We approve, without reservation, the
plans for Epworth League extension -which
provide for the systematic training of our
young people In Christian work. The im
portance of the study of such great topics
as the English Bible. Christian stewardship
and- personal evangelism cannot bo over
estimated.
â¢ I TEMPERANCE.
1. That we are as unalterably as ever op
posed to the open saloon and the liquor
trarflc. and we mean to keep up our war
upon this wicked business until our conti
nent Is freed from the dreadful curse,
r, * h ? 1 jve greatly rejoiced at the aboli
tion of the "Canteen" in our army, and
deplore the fact that a persistent effort is
being made to have It restored. Specially
is th is distressing to us when we note that
Russia Is protesting against the canteen,
and that even France has prohibited it in
her army camps. "We earnestly hope that
wiser counsels will prevail in free, Chris
tian America, and^o this end. we will ever
pray and fight. . .. . â¢ Â¦ ,
COLORED EPWORTH LEAGUERS.
We have 'learned; that representatives ' of
the various Christian. Touns People's So
cieties among the colored churches of the
country plan to hold a gathering In the
summer of 1902, looking- to the better de
velopment of their young: people in Chris
tian work, and we desire to express our
approval . of the movement and heartily
recommend It to the colored young people
of the Epworth League.
- JUNIOR WORK.
"We are much encouraged with the con
tinual . growth of our Junior Epworth
League, and believing- this school for the
training of our youngest soldiers for Christ
is accomplishing great good would unhesi
tatingly, urge all our pastors and Christian
workers to organize our boys and girls
into Junior chapters wherever, possible.
'SUPREME PURPOSE.
J While we do not underestimate the vital
relation to our organization of its literary,
social and benevolent department, we de
sire to emphasize, once again, the supreme
purpose of our existence, L e., the develop
ment of the highest type of spiritual ex
perience and 1 life in the young members oÂ£
our churches and the salvation of the mul
titudes of young men and women of our
communities who are still far from God.

The person who depends upon the words of
Christ without considering those of St. -Paul
is in the realm of . puerility. - It is like ac
cepting the statement of one witness and Ig
noring those of four others. The minister who
speaks slightingly of Paul must be pitied ; r if
he does it a third time he should be â¢ removed
from the pulpit. All that rational people,be
lieve is substantial unity in ; the midst, of cir

they, saw as a unit.. but : their stories vary* in
the relation of . circumstances! It is like a

built upon faith. We must have faith. -The
saying that Ignorance is the mother of devo

which has reared a kingdom which cannot be

which is founded upon faith, to perish out ct

After the chairman, the Rev. W. H.
Winthrow, had summoned the assemblage
to order, the Rev. Alonzo Monk spoke on
"The Spirit of Methodism.", The main
contention of his remarks were that Meth
odism if not active was nothing; that
Methodism.,, having no iron-bound ritual,
was susceptible to new ideas and capable
of keepeing aoreast with the times, and
that, finally, the Methodists have drawn
to themselves the attention of the world
through its tendency to do and to act.
The Rev. Mr. Monk was followed by the
Rev. W. F. Anderson, who in the course
of his address stated that there are no
small things in the work for God, and
that he was tired of hearing of $3000 min
isters. $4000 ministers and $300 ministers,
when all were equal in the service of the
Lord. He said further that the duty
which man owes to himself is that of self
realization, and that all who study the
Bible cannot help but feel that' God in
tended that he should attain the highest
ideal of character.
Amid a flow of eloquence, offerings of
prayers to God and a perfect torrent of
revival songs, that part of the Epworth
League convention at the Alhambra Thea

the meeting lasted but a few minutes
longer a genuine Methodist revival would
have been inaugurated. Enthusiasm was
aroused to such a pitch that the delegates
were reluctant to quit the hall. Before the

which embraced every one that contrib

MEETING AT ALHAMBRA
Delegates Rejoice in the True Old
Dr. Edward S. Ninde closed the meeting
with a feeling farewell, and the touching
consecration service of the Epworth
League. "Leaguers," he said solemnly,
"our work will be in vain it there is no
power in us from on high. We may grasp
the hand of another, but in that grasp
will be no power if we have not within
us the power of the Holy Spirit." {
Rev. A. C. Crews was introduced to read
the resolutions adopted by the league
committee, and then the next speaker.
Rev. W. J. Young- of Lynchburg-, Va.,
took the platform. ."We have been trying
to learn what there is to do," he said,
"and how, under God's blessing-, we are
to do. it. We are come to this last nlgtit
in our convention that we may learn how
we may consecrate . ourselves to the ser
vice of the Master in the new century. All
our effort has tMs in view, that we may
do our work more thoroughly, that we
may help in the uplifting of our fellow
men." . -Â¦
The chairman then introduced Rev. W.
P. Thirkleld, D. D., of Cincinnati as the
first speaker.
The meeting was opened by an eloquent
prayer by Rev. R. P. T. Ramsay of South
ern California, and Rev. Barraclough
spoke briefly upon the solemnity of "meet
ing and of parting, and of the closing of
such a great gathering of earnest Chris
tians as had. been assembled for days past
in San Francisco. "Let the effect of this
convention," he said, "be such that each
delegate will carry to his own home such
a force of enthusiasm in the work that
he will be a supply center for his own
neighborhood."

by William Grandeman, the last named

The last fifteen minutes was occupied
in a warning as to habits and personal
appeal to the audience for an acceptance
of the salvation offered full and free.

and downward to nothing. When a man comes
to you saying he wants to be a Christian you
must be able to tell him what to do. Give a
man something he can touch. Place before the

Havo faith In Jesus Christ as a man. There
Is something in the face of Jesus Christ which
attracts man. He shows a character which
tends to convince man when he says, "What
soever ye shall ask in my name that 'will I
do." Jesus Christ when on earth was one
who could be approached by a man, and no
man who approached him waa ever turned
away. He Is now In heaven. He Is the same
loving, kind, gentle Savior as when on earth
and never turns any one away who cornea to
him seeking tho forgiveness of his sins.'
Jesus Christ aa a man la in response to tre
i demands of human nature. The depths of
God's love to man is conveyed to the. human
race through Jesus Christ to man. "God so

was the text of the morning. The speaker
Bald in part:
One of the distinct characteristics of the
Christian religion lies in the fact that we
have to do with the unseen. We worship a
God wÂ« have never 'seen, one who Is Invisible,
one whem not bavin? seen yet we love. "We
are pilgrims, having no city but one to come.
We seek an unseen city for our goal.
How are we to place ourselves in a satisfac
tory relationshlD to this spiritual world? We
. cannot see It with our physical eyes, feel It
with our physical hand, hear It with our physi
cal ears: yet we walk by faith not by sight,
and in this we have our answer.
Another question: What do we mean by
faith? Do we know anything about faith? We
know the meaning of love by experience. Not
by what some one tells us or -by what we see.
but by our . actual experience. In the same
way me must learn of faith.
Sin 13 the only unnatural thing: in the world.
When we are called to walk a Christian life
we are called to walk the natural life. 'When
we live the natural life we are living the
Christian life. What I am trying to empha
size is the naturalness and necessity of faith.
There are those who call for something dlt-.
ferent from faith; those -who want something
they call cold, hard facts: .those who place
facts above faith: those who say oar religious
foundation should be facts and not faith.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash.. July 21.â A
tragedy was narrowly ' averted on the
steamer Elmore by the quick action of
Captain Charles Davis. . The United
States Court at Nome had decided that
Carl Perry was a jumper on mining prop
erty on Black Gulch ,- near Bluff City,
which was claimed by Miss Lena Wal
ton. After the decision had been ren
dered all parties boarded the Elmore for
Bluff City to take possession of the cov
eted claim, and just before the steamer
reached that place Miss Walton and
Perry had some words. The - latter
whipped out his pistol, but before he could
pull the trigger Captain Davis . disarmed
him. When Bluff City was reached Perry,
fearing arrest, disappeared and Miss
Walton reached the mining .claim, posted
her \ notice and was in possession. The
property Is said to be one of the .most
promising in that- district.

HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
// Â» POWER, NAPA, July ZLâ The
IV* people of this city are Borr<*wlng
y^^ over the departure of the League
of the Cross Cadets. At 3 q^lock
this afternoon a special train of
sixteen cans, bearing the regiment,
pulled out of the depot There was
a large crowd present to bid good-by to
the young soldiers. The fair sex predomi
nated and their good-bys and au revolrs
had a note of sincerity in them. The
leave-taking was a sad one and seemed
to be made more bo by the band's rendi
tion of "Auld Lang Syne."
As the train pulled out of the depot the
cheers of the cadets found an echo In the
shouts of the residents of Napa. Coupled
Â¦with these were the shouts of half a bat
talion of cadets, who were left behind in
the hurry to leave on schedule â¢ time.
Lieutenant Colonel McGloln discovered in
quick time that many of the men failed
to get aboard. He ordered the conductor
to return and the latter obeyed instruc
tions. Agraln the regiment was In Napa
and again it departed amid cheers and
invitations to return another year. Â¦
The last day of this memorable encamp
ment was as interesting as the previous
days. Those cadets who were not aroused
from slumber by pranks played on them
by fellow members of the regiment were
out of their tents at reveille, which was
rounded at 6:20 a. m. The decorations in
the .various company streets were taken
down and preparations for breaking camp
were begun. The breakfast was a sub
stantial one, but the cadets could not re
sist the temptation to Bingr a song- about
hanging the caterer to a sour apple three.
Sermon by Father CByan.
The regiment attended special services
at St. John's Church. As usual the sacred
edifice was crowded. The presence of the
cadets in full panoply of war added inter
est to the services. The Rev. Philip
O'Ryan, spiritual director of the regiment,
celebrated the mass. Privates Sohn
and Burns of Company A acted as
acolytes. Special music was rendered by
an augmented choir. Armand Putz, di
rector of the band, rendered "The Palms"
and "Nearer. My God, to Thee" on the
cornet. Father O'Ryan's sermon was
most impressive. In part he said:
On this closing day of your encampment I
*ish to congratulate the officers and members
or the orpa.11iza.tion for their exemplary and
Erentlemanly conduct and bearing during the
week. From my experience with former en
campments and my long connection with thÂ«
organization. I never for a moment entertained
a fear that the League of the CrosÂ«- Cadets
â¢would do anything to scandalize the pious peo
ple of Napa. It Is true we are not a Sunday

dollars worth " of lumber and crates as
well as fruit. Â¦ â¢. I

was at Shell Mound on business, that of
shooting. Two days ago some of the wise
men from the East said . look out for

Club of Pittsburg. . And well they might,
for 'this Louis P. Ittel has proved himself
a shooter. A dark horse, blanketed from
public view as he rang up his strings one
after the other, Ittel burst forth yester
day as a star of the first magnitude.
"When his twenty strings were added up
it .was . found that Ittel had scored for
kingship honors no fewer than '392 points,
just two less than Adolph Strecker. Until
Strecker had made his record, 392 was a
towering height or two over every score
made in competition.
With this championship mark In front
of him Ittel certainly - did phenomenal
work. Like Strecker he is of the slender,
keenly strung order of man and' his la?t

GRACEFUL ATHLETES GIVE #
." \ , EXHIBITION OF SKTLL
The pleasing feature of the day was the
exhibition given by the- members of the
various Turn " Vereins of this city and
Oakland. Fully 400 members of the Ger
man Turner societies' were the guests of
the officials of the Bundesfest, and they
contributed largely toward the success of
the second largest day of the festival.
The societies,, arrived at the grounds
early in the morning. They were met. at
the gate by President Kuhl& and the offi
cers of the" bund and a brass band and
escorted to the pavilions erected about
the park for their use. The members of
tho Turn Vereins were" all' attired in the
neat gray uniform which has been worn
bythem at many great festivals.- "They
presented- a handsome^ appearance as they
marched through the- grounds and the
thousands of spectators who stpod on eacli
side of the line of niarch>applauded them
liberally. The societies- represented in
the parade were the Eintracht Turn Sec
tion. San Francisco Turn Verein, Oakland
.Turn Verein and the Mission Turn Verein.
The field in front of the music stand
was literally covered with gymnastic ap
paratus. More than fifty of the young
.fellows who marched in the ranks of the
Turners were crack gymnasts.

STREAM OF SHOOTERS
CONGEST THE STAXJLS
The number of people who choked loco
motion in the grounds was certainly big.
It was a busy day in every avenue and
walk. But this was nothing compared to
the scene at the ranges. Men who &hoot
for fun, men who shoot for records, men
who shoot for return values flocked Into
the stalls and used up every available
ticket that was on hand. On some tar-
Kets tickets were used twice. Never be
fore was such a sputtering fire heard at
Shell Mound. There was no surcease from
the noise and fury of target pinging and
gun shooting, and when the day was over
secretaries, markers and ticket sellers
were exhausted from their steady, unre
mitting labors.
GAY OLD PICNIC TIME

merry-makers celebrated song and meas

The different German societies* estab
lished headquarters of entertainment. A
toast and a song and a toast again; but
no confusion, no disorder. This continued
until a late hour in the evening when tne
dancers, tired and worn out with a' day
and night session of the light fantastic,
boarded the city-bound trains. The big
gest social day of the festival had come
and gone and all were happy and light in
spirit, but physically used up. It was .a
yawning crowd that went home on the

WILKESBARRE. Pa.. July 2Lâ The sta
tionary" firemen's strike has practically
collapsed. At a" conference here to-day
between the executive beard "of the United
Mine Workera and the striking firemen
committees were appointed to wait : onthe
coal companies and if the strikers are
taken back the strike will be declared off.
The following statement was issued
from the firemen's headquarters to-night:
After the officers of the three districts of the
United Mice Workers defined the attitude they
contemplated assuming toward the firemen,
should their strike continue, we thought that
it would be to the interest of all concerned to
bring It to a speedy termination; and in con
sequence thereof we made propositions to them
which were adopted, after which we instructed
the firemen to pursue all honorable means to
have their positions returned.
Although the strike is not yet declared off
until after the answers are received from their
jttnp\oyerm, yet it seems to be the prevailing;
"'opinion. that should they be favorable the ac
tion of the delegates Monday evening will end
the strike. But ehould any one now out of
employment oa account of the strike be dis
criminated against, the end would be as far
off ae ever, and the firemen are determined

The sharpshooters felt the surging

postponed their work "at the targets on
account of the on rush and streaming of
spectators through the gallery above the
shooting' etalls. The pack was greatest in
this very place. Here everybody who en
tered the grounds was to be seen at one
time or another during the. day. Some came
out of curiosity and others out of interest
in the shooters. Some sat down at the
tables, toasted countless kings in the
white-topped liquor or the cold Rhine
â¢wine ae their fancy dictated. Others
walked in and out again without rhyme or
reason. They did not understand nor
could they feel the spirit that act

ST. JOHNS, 'N. F.. July * 21.â The
mail steamer ' Home,' which " arrived
here to-day from Labrador, reports "that
the coast is blockaded with ice floes, es

floes are -imnenetrable. This will greatly
delay the Peary relief steamer ErlTc,
which counted upon calling, at Turnavia,
Northern Labrador, and landing her last

NEW YORK, July '21.â "This Is no time
for talking; it Is time for . action." This
was Rear Admiral Wlnfleld Scott Schley's
reply to-night to .a"* request for a state
ment of his intentions in regard to the
attack made upon him in the third .-.vol
ume of Edgar Stanton Maclay's "History
of the Navy.' 1 - Â¦ 'â¢ â¢Â¦Â¦ri :Â¦ ' â¢ . Â¦Â¦Â¦'...
It foreshadowed Rear Admiral \ Schley"s
purpose of taking measures \ to i call Ma
clay legally to account for the accusations
of cowardice and falsehood imputed to
him. In the' volume which has juat been
issued from the press. . ..
Beyond the declaration that the time for
action had arrived, Rear Admiral Schley.
would say nothing of his plans as to Hie
shafts which have been aimed at him.
That It is his Intention, however, to sum
mon ;Maclay and possibly also his pub
lishers to answer in the courts for his
version of the course pursued by Rear
Admiral Schley during .the operations
which culminated in the battle of San
tiago, there could be no doubt.
â¢ Rear Admiral Schley spoke like a man
who has endured to the limit of. his capa
city the taunts of his opponents. Had the
controversy ; which has now reached' its
climax occurred a century and a half at;o,
Maclay would have by:this time received
a challenge, It was asserted, to answer for
his words on the field of honor.
Maclay, in discussing his book, upon be
ing reminded of the possibility that Rear
Admiral Schley would seek redress In the
courts, said that he was . perfectly -willing
to face any action that might be brought.
At the same time," however, he suggested
that the natural course for Rear Admiral
Schley to pursue would be to apply for a
court of 'inquiry so .that- he -. might be
Judged by his fellow officers. ' *

"Job and the Power of Pain."
Yielding to the solicitations of many
persons at Camp Reverie who were not
here early In the week when Professor
Stratton gave his first two addresses, he
to-day spoke on "Job and the Power of
Pain." Touching on the fact that "the
college training of necessity cultivates
the attitude of self-asserdon, of personal
masteryâ a kind of intellectual tyranny
over the universe," Mr. Stratton said:
"There should be more attention given in
cur colleges to spiritual restoratives, to
exercises which would cause us to resume
a hearty and healthy attitude toward
life. â¢ â¢ â¢ I know of nothing better,
during the college period itself, than to
come frequently into the presence of the
jrreat and beautiful products of the hu
man spirit and let them work upon us
and help us to truer reverence. We of the
vounger generation, in our neglect of the
Hebrew Scriptures, are in danger of al
lowing this wonderful book of Job to
cease to be a part of our spiritual re
sources." When expressions like the fol
lowing fall from the lips of the molders
of the thought of our young men and
maidens, we may well augur the best for.
and be proud of our great university:
"Through suffering there is revealed in
the vrorld, with a clearness which noth
ing else can give, the unselfishness, the
unfaltering loyalty to one's ideals, which
we feel if the most precious trait in men.
"Men vised to think that perfection of
character could be stated as' a relation
between two persons merejy. between,
God and the individual's private will. The
modern world, however, has come to see
that personal attainment Â«romes only
through connection with other men and
requires human co-operation. â¢ â¢ â¢ Our
highest powers are called out and realized
only in the presence of other men; so
that, without expressing, or proving his
character to them, a man does not finally
come into possession of his character.
"Our own purification and the purifica
tion of society comes through the influ
ence of the revelation of one man's heart
to his fellows. Character is thus some
thing which cannot be as a secret between
God and individual, but must be tested
and proved and revealed to others, both
for bis sake and -for one's own.
"It Is a strange fact, which history
brings out, that men who have been su
premely effective in drawing men are
those whose sincerity has been witnessed
and sealed by enduring pain. Without the
prison and the hemlock, Socrates would
have seemed a tiresome quibbler. Without
the stripes and the crucifixion, Jerusalem
would never have been the â¢ renewing
source of our modern life.
"The value of suffering thus rests not
primarily on Its power to call forth pity,
but on its power to bring man into the
very presence of spiritual facts. Up to the
tim<9 of his great trial Job says he had
only heard of the Lord by the hearing of
the ear. but during his affliction, his eye
caw him face to face. Pain discloses to
the sufferer and to those who witness his
suffering the reality of an intangible
world, in that men will give their bodies
to bÂ«Â» burned rather than do even the least
that is contrary to truth 'or honor or
friendship or worship."

CLEVELAND, Miss., July 21.â This
morning at 1:30 a band of armed negroes,
none of whom was known, rode into
Cleveland and, stopping a party of three
white men ! on the street, made threaten

to give their names, they answered by
brinsring their rifles into play. One of the
negroes was killed on the spot. Another
was wounded and it is reported that his
body has been found on the outskirts of
town. The others escaped, although It is
supposed that more than three were hurt.
They were armed with rifles and were

FORMER Mayor L. R. Ellert died
at 4:20 p. m. yesterday at his
home, 1913 Webster street, after
an Illness of several months' <lur-
ation. Death was due to a com
plication of diseases. The end was ex
pected and the wife and son of the ex-
Mayor were at the bedside when he passed
away.
Dr. Julian, Perrault, the attending phy
sician, - announced yesterday at noon,
after a consultation with other phy
sicians, that Mr. Ellert's malady was
beyond treatment; that death might ccme
at any time and that in any event the
patient could survive but a few days. ,
Brig-ht's disease of the kidneys.. liver trou~/
ble and an affection of the heart, from !
which Mr. Ellert suffered many years,
aggravated by excessive bicycle riding,
carried him to a point where there was
nothing left for the physicians 1 to. do but
to make him as comfortable as possible
until the end came.
Mr. Ellert suffered severely for
months and was confined to his bed 'for
ten days. For several days he had been
unconscious. Hi3 wife and son were con
stantly at his bedside, having been noti
fied by Dr. Perrault that death within a
short time was inevitable.
When Mr. Ellert began to decline "sev
eral months ago he decided, at the sug
gestion of Dr. Perrault, to go Into the
country. Dr. Perrault accompanied 1.1m.
Mr. Ellert remained. two months at Car
mcl River and a month at Para'so
Springs. The change brought about no
noticeable improvement, however, and
Mr. Ellert took up his residence in Ala
meda County with his family. He became
eo enfeebled that it was decided a few
weeks ago to bring him to his home in
this city, the fact that he could live but
a short time being clearly apparent.
Shortly after Mr. Ellert was brought
back to this city Dr. Perrault called Dr.
MacMonagle. Dr. W. R. Cluness Sr., Dr.
Hlrschfelder and Dr. E. L. Perrault into
consultation. Mr. Ellert was carefully ex
amined by the physicians and all reached
the conclusion that the patient was be
yond aid. From that time Dr. Julian Per
rault was in constant attendance upon
Mr. Ellert, not with the hope that he
could better his health, but for the pur
pose of alleviating his pain during the
brief moments of the patient's conscious
ness. Mr. Ellert ra lied for a moment yes
terday morning, but, as Dr. Perrault said,
it was naught but a flash, and again the
patient lapsed into unconsciousness, jink
ing lower and lower, until death finally
relieved his sufferings.
A Self-Made Man.
Ex-Mayor Ellert was born in this city In
October of 1S56, hence was in his forty
fifth year. When a mere youngster his
parents went to Redwood City, and there

SMUGGLERS FALL
INTO NEAT TRAP
Shortly after his retirement from the
Mayoralty he was admitted to- the bar,
and abandoning active politics formed a
partnership with George D. Squires, with
offices In the Mills building. He organ
ized the California Title Insurance and
Trust Company and served as vice pre3l
dent and manager of the corporation for
a year, when he resigned. The Sanitary
Reduction Works was also built under
his directorship and his interests in the
two corporations named occupied a con
siderable portion of his time. Finally ill
health compelled him to abandon active
control of these corporations, but his
health Improving he again took up his
work and also organized the Continental
Salt and -Chemical Company. A sensa
tional suit was recently filed against Mr.
Ellert. Sheriff Lackmann and A. L.
Berteling as directors of this corpora
tion, but Mr. Ellert never knew that a
legal fight which promises to be full of
bitterness had grown out of this, his last
work as an organizer and promoter.
Mr.Ellert's widow was a Miss Boucher
Arthur Ellert, an only son, is now 15
years of age. * â¢
His last work of note in public life
was as a member of the Board of Free
holders, elected to frame a- charter for
the city. Ellert led a spirited fight in
the board for the office of- president, but
was defeatea by Joseph Britton, whose
death occurred a few days ago. He won
the fight for the chairmanship of the
legislative department, however, and was
a member of the finance, executive Â¦ and
public works committees.
Member of Board of Freeholders.
Upon leaving the College, of Pharmacy
he obtained backing and opened the drug
store on the southwest corner of Kearny
and California streets. This establish
ment Mr. Ellert conducted for many
years, and it was while engaged In this
business that he went Into politics, and
for fifteen years was prominently identi
fied with the affairs of the municipality.
In 18S6 ho was nominated for the office of
School Director, but was | defeated. This
! did not cool his political ardor, however,
and in 1888 heswas elected -Supervisor. He
* wa3 re-electedvto the office of Supervisor
in 1890,. and at the end of his term accept
ed the Non-Partisan nomination for the
Mayoralty. He had fulfilled his public
trust bo faithfully in the face of trying
obstacles that his election was a- natural
sequence. . ;'Â¦Â¦Â¦. ; â¢ .
Again Ellert came up for re-election to
â¢ tho office of Mayor, but a political up
heaval, coupled with Adolph Sutro's. mas
terly " battle against the Market-street
Railway. Company, which. was not high in
the estimation of the people at that time,
resulted in his defeat and the election of
Sutro.
young Ellert obtained his first employ
ment, as a newsboy on the old San Fran
cisco ;mfl San Jose Railroad, now a part
of the Southern Pacific system. While
working as a newsboy he accumulated
sufficient money to enable him to attend
a business college in this city, from which
he graduated. Leaving the college, he
obtained employment as a drug clerk, and
from his earnings saved sufficient money
to carry him through the College of Phar
macy. .
EL.PASO, Texas, July 21.â A smuggling
.conspiracy of gigantic proportions was
unearthed by cuaoms guards last night
and resulted in the arrest of three mem
bers of tho smuggler gang and the seiz
ure in this city of several thousand cigars
of 'the finest Mexican manufacture. The
smugglers were all Mexicans and were
captured red-handed, through one of the
neatest ruses ever worked on the border.
One of the prisoners is Francisco Guer
rera. a Mexican customs official,' and one
of his pals Is an El Paso tailor.
Some weeks ago these men approached
Carl Ennis, a local cigar dealer, and pro
posed to furnish him as many; thou'san-J
.smuggled cigars pep month as he might
desire.' He closed a contract with thorn
lor 15,000 Victoria de Colons monthly at
manufacturers' prices. Last night was
i agreed upon for the delivery of the first
consignment of the co'ntraband goods and
when the smugglers reached the rendez
vous in this city agreed upon they found
two customs guards and a policeman in
waiting. The officers covered the smug
glers with six-shooters and the arrest was
made .... without . bloodshed. â¢ The i cigars
which had been brought over, from Mex
ico were seized and will be , used as evi
dence when the case is called before ;thvj
United States commissioner. This, with
the testimony of Ennis, Is thought to be
sufficient to convict the smugglers anj
send them up for iong terms.

There was not a trace of rain anywhere
5n this vicinity, and what little wind there
was came from the south and instead of
being a relief added to the discomfort.
The parks offered rot the slightest relief
to the masses who sought cool retreats.
Four prostrations were reported to the
police. Not a cloud appeared in the sky
and no relief is in sight.

generally heeded, nearly every church in
the city holding well-attended services
riven up to prayer that the drought
mig-ht be broken.
: i:iiite came as a draught from a furnace,

The resolution was sent to a' committee and.it
may lie forever lost in; a pigeonhole^ but none the
less it has served the . purpose of showing the Vir
ginians that- there are. snags; in- their way, and- that
to adopt any such suffrage plans as those applied in
North Carolina . and proposed in Alabama would- be
for them a violation of those principles of political
liberty that have made Virginia glorious. The plan
proposed in' Alabama is much better than . that of
North Carolina, and now the Virginians should try
to improve on Alabama. Her restrictions should have
nothing to do with birth, color oi* ancestry.

And we furthermore declare it objectionable, because
it establishes a permanent, hereditary, governing class,
which is undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of a

Eesolved, That it is the sense of this convention
that the adoption of any provision whereby a privilege
is given one citizen over another in the matter of suf
frage by reason of his or her ancestors'" military ser
vice, is class legislation of the most vicious kind,* and in
violation of the principles of the bill of rights as pro
mulgated to the world by Virginians more than a cen
tury ago, wherein they declare that no set of men are
entitled to exclusive privileges, and in violation of both
the letter and spirit of the Constitution of the United
States, which we, as voters, have sworn to defend, as
well as in violation of the principles of equal rights
which are inherent in the bqdy politic, which we repre
sent, and to which we are amenable in the forum of po
litical ethics, and the specific application ofÂ» which te?t,
without any exceptions, provisos or alternatives, would
actually disfranchise -some members of .this body. if ap
plied to them. â¢
VIRGINIA'S constitutional convention has
been in session for more than a month, and has
not yet settled upon the method of dealing
with the suffrage question. It was fondly believed
by some sanguine qptimists that it would be easy to
adopt the "grandfather" plan of North Carolina or
the "old" soldier" plan of Alabama and thus provide
for excluding illiterate negroes from the polls while
admitting illiterate whites. Those fond hopes are in
danger of disappointment. Among the members of
the convention is a Mr. O'Flaherty, whose father was
born in Ireland, and he objects to giving any special
privileges to men whose fathers or grandfathers were
in Virginia, or who took part in any, of the
wars of that State. Mr. O'Flaherty recently sub
mitted to. the convention this resolution:
A SNAG IN VIRGINIA.
Some enterprising man has" suggested to Mr. Car
negie that instead of building any more libraries he
construct a model road suitable for automobiles clear
across the United States. That would surely be a
high way of spending his surplus millions.
DESPITE the fact that public sentiment has
strongly declared" against the reciprocity
treaties now in the hands of the Senate, some
of the supporters of the treaties still cherish a belief
that they will be ratified. Even the declarations
against them made by Senators of" known influence
have not convinced these sanguine opponents of uni
form protection that their case is a hopeless one. A
few Republican as well as the whole number of free
trade papers support the treaties, and of late they have
taken to declaring that the President -will exert his
influence to procure their ratification.
The Baltimore American, after declaring that
"mugwump journals contend that the President will
not take any aggressive steps to secure .the ratifica
tion of the treaties already negotiated," says: "Ever
since Blaine enunciated the principle of reciprocity it
has been accepted as a cardinal Republican doctrine.
William McKinley was one of its earliest and sturdiest
champions before he was elevated to the Presidency.
Since then he has caused the negotiation of a num
ber of. highly important reciprocity treaties. These
were submitted to the last Senate, but because of the
stress of more vital matters were hot considered.
They will come before the next Senate, and it is well
understood to be part of the State Department pro
gramme to secure their ratification. Not only this,
the State Department proposes the negotiation of ad
ditional treaties. These things would not be con
templated by Secretary Hay did not the President
approve."
The ' papery that contend that the President will
not take aggressive steps to procure the ratification
of the treatfes are not "mugwump journals," as our
Baltimore contemporary thinks. They are stanch and
stalwart Republican- papers that stand by the prin T
ciple of protection and are for reciprocity of the kind
expressed in the Republican platform of 1906 in the
words: "We favor the associated policy of reciprocity
so directed as to open our markets on favorable'terms
for what we do not ourselves produce in return for
free foreign markets." As the treaties now before
the Senate' do hot conform to that declaration of re
ciprocity, it is not to be assumed that the President
will use the influence of his office to bring about their
ratification.'
Another paper that relies upon the President to
force the treaties upon the Senate is the Boston Ad
vertiser, which in a recent issue said: '."The time to
make reciprocal trade treaties is. the present, while
nations desire eagerly the benefits of trade with the
United' States. Just now foreign consumers want
what Americans have to sell. When other nations are
able and eager to satisfy the foreign demand, it will

In" San Francisco business is good. The export
trade is particularly brisk, there being an active de
mand for cur farm and orchard products from a vast
area, extending from Nome to Texas and Colorado/
The demand for potatoes for the, West and South
west, on account of the drought, is said to be the
sharpest ever known at this season, while fruit, if
choice and suitable for shipment, is eagerly taken by
shippers to the north. The export demand for gen
eral merchandise is also lively, and the wholesalers
express themselves ss more than satisfied w-ith the
volume of exports. The drought in the West and
Southwest, combined with the demand for goods for
the northern mining regions, is keeping the wholer
salers busy filling orders for all classes of merchan
dise: therefore, as far as we are concerned, it is an
'& wind that blows robody any' good.
The crop outlook on the whole is cheerful. While
the yield of corn and oats will fall short of earlier
expectations there will be no scarcity in either, and
the loss in yield will probably be more than offset by
the increase in price. The only sufferers will be those
farmers in the Southwest whose crops are utter fail
ores, and these are in a minority. Many will have
from a third to half a crop, for which they will get
better prices than they would have for a large yield.
As for wheat, the crop promises to be a bumper,
the most conservative estimates placing it at 700,000,
000 bushels, at least, while corn is expected to yield
about 2,000,000,000 bushels. Prices for corn and oats
fell materially during the early part of the week, in
consequence of the rains, but when, later on, the rain
fall was found to have been light, scattering and in
sufficient, there was a sharp -recovery.
The leading staples are reported in good condition
as a rule. Even iron. and steel continue fairly active,
though if the suspension of labor be prolonged an
accumulation of stock is expected- A much better
feeling in wool has developed of late and the finer
grades are slowly but steadily hardening. The textile
manufactures are also improving in volume of busi
ness. Shipments of boots and shoes from Eastern
'jnarkets, while smaller than of late, exceed those of
the same period last year, and orders are free, with
quick shipment generally called for. The woolen
mills are reported more active than usual at this
time of the year. There is no change in the cotton
situation, while leather is very firm and hides are
steady. Â¦ Provisions continue strong, and, high as
prices are, dealers are looking for still further ad
vances every day, supplies being unusually light and
the livestock markets very firm in all sections.
The only gloomy reports were received from the
corn belt of the West and Southwest, where the pro
longed drought has cut down the yield of corn and
oats. Other sections sent" cheerful reports, those
from the South Atlantic, Central West and North
west showing an improvement over those of the pre
ceding week in the matter of crop prospects and the
volume of distributive trade. While the great steel
strike has caused the greatest suspension of labor in
some years the number of men out is less than an
ticipated, and thus far the retail and jobbing trades
have not reflected any serious falling off in conse
quence.
THE weather in the West and labor strikes in
the East conspired to check business last week,
but the volume of trade showed an increase of
64.1 per cent over the. same week last year, accord
ing to the bank clearings, all cities of importance,
except Minneapolis, St. Paul and New Orleans, show
ing a gain. The largest cities exhibited marked
gains, New York rising to 93-3 per cent, though much
of the latter was undoubtedly due to stock specula
tion. The failures for the week were 208, against
202 last year.

GETTING INTO A SCRAPEâ W. P.,
Leadville, Colo. "The Book. of Days"
(1863), gives the following as the origin of
the common expression,, "getting into a
scrape": \ '
"Thereis a game called golf, almost pe
culiar to Scotland, though also frequently
played upon Blackheath. lnvolving / the use
of a small elastic ball, which is driven
from point to point with/ a variety of
wopden^and Iron clubs. In the north it
is played for the most" part upon downs
near the sea. - One of the troubles-of the
golf players is the little hole which the
rabbit makes in the sward in Its first ef
forts at a burrow; this is commonly called
'a rabbit's scrape.'. When a ball gets into
a 'scrape' it can hardly be played. The
rules of golfing societies include one in
dicating what Is allowable to j the player
when he; gets -into- a 'scrape.* v Here, and
here alone, has the phrase a direct and In
telligible meaning. It /seems therefore
allowable to surmise .that this" phrase
originated among the golfing societies of
the '.north/ and In time spread to the rest
of the public.";. . ;^ â¢
/ Another version, dating back to 1803,
says that deer" in rutting season dig up the
land, with their forefeet to the depth of
half' a" foot "and sometimes half a yard.
These are called scrapes, and as a writer
of those times has it,' "Woe be to any
who get Into it. for, many have got Into
a scrape and been Injured," hence the ap
plication of /"he ; has got into a scrape"
to .one - who has got into trouble which
may, result seriously to him.

DURING my last visit to Constantinople I had the oppor- ,
tunity pf making a close study of the Sultan's work
shops, writes one of - the London Globe . contributors.
They are situated on the right hand of the entrance to
the Yildiz Kiosk, and consist of a mechanical workshop
with a foundry, joiner's shop, wood carving and carpentry
shops, and designing and modeling room, which give 'employ
ment to from fifty to sixty workmen. The work turned out in
these workshops is exclusively for the Imperial Palace, and
in. them are made the costly presents which â¢ the Sultan is so
fond of sending to foreign princes. It Is said that "the Ruler
of the Faithful" often lends a hand in some special piece of
work, but that Is not quite 'true; the most that the Sultan does
is to improve a design which has been made according to his
suggestions, and laid before him by the director of the work
shops. The latter Is no lets a person than the general of a
division, and he presents a very imposing figure with his face
full of energy and his long white beard; With a kindly smile
from his blue eyes his excellency received me with great
courtesy and personally conducted me in my walk through the
workshops. His thoroughly friendly reception, his blue eyes,
and especially his absolutely perfect French accent made me
doubt his nationality In spite of his Turkish name; however,
I ventured to pay him a discreet compliment upon his perfect
French, and the Pasha confessed to me with a smile that he
was not a Turk but a Belgian. He told me that he had been a
captain in the Belgian army, and that shortly before the out
break of the Russo-Turkish war he had left the Belgian service
and entered that of Turkey. He made rapid advance in his
new. home, distinguished' himself in several battles, and finally
was appointed a general of division and director of the Sul
tan's workshops. Highly esteemed by the Sultan on account
of his services to Turkey, the Pasha is. looked on askance by
his former countrymen, for they cannot forgive him for having
embraced the Mohammedan faith with all the fervor of a per
vert.
I could scarcely restrain my surprise when my guide drew
attention to the various workmen engaged in the imperial
workshops, for they turned out to be, in many cases, higher
officers of the Turkish army on active service. Here was a
colonel of infantry energetically planing a window frame for
one of the rooms in the harem. At a little distance was a
riding master busily occupied with a piece of raw Iron on a
turning bench, while in the smithy a commander of a detach
ment was working away and turning out iron stakes for use
in the park. The other workmen are, for the most part, sol
diers. The Turkish workman is uncommonly clever, and 13
especially conspicuous by the astonishing readinasa which ha
displays in imitating strange work. Thus, I wf.s shown an
imitation of a German orchestrion, and the original could
scarcely be distinguished from the copy. In the goldsmith'3
art the Turks are extremely adroit, and most of the Turkish
orders are made in the Sultan's workshops. The objects
destined to be cent to foreign potentates are generally cabinet
work. Such pieces of furniture, which are often the work of
many years; are inlaid most artistically with ivory, mothor-of
pearl, ebony and precious metals, and they are thus of great
value. In additipn to these workshops the Sultan possesses a
porcelain manufactory, which is managed by a French expert,
and turns out very sterling examples of the potter's art.
They Are Close "to" the Imperial Palaee, and Their Director Was Once a

The controversy is an ugly one, and for 'a long
time it has seemed to be impossible of peaceful solu
tion; but now that all the parties are to be brought
together, it may be that the influence of the congress
as a whole will have the effect of bringing them to
agree upon some basis of settlement. It is at any
rate gratifying to know that the congress is to be
fully representative of all American states. . To have
accomplished that much is to have made a long step
toward. achieving all the promoters of the movement
hoped for. . â¢*
It is quite, likely the point of chief discussion will
be that of deciding whether arbitration is to be con
fined to future disputes or whether it is to apply to
disputes now existing. % Chile would have no objec
tion to the former alternative, as her only fight is
to keep hold on the provinces of Peru which she has
now in her possession. On the other hand Peru and
her ally, Bolivia, and possibly several other South
American states, \vill demand that the agreement for
arbitration shall be made retroactive.
What compromise has been agreed upon Â¦ by the
contending parties does not appear, but it is certain
arbitration has not' been omitted! In fact it stands
first on the official tentative programme, which, as
announced from Washington, provides for*:the con
sideration of the following subjects: First, arbitra
tion; se'eond, international court of claims; third,
measures for, the protection of industry and com
merce, development of the means of communication
among the countries composing the union; and fourth,
reorganization of the international bureau of Ameri
can republics. . ; â¢
It will be . remembered that Chile interposed ob
jections to the programme because it provided for
the establishment of an international tribunal to arbi
trate all disputes among American countries. Her
objections were due to the fact that she holds certain
territories which are claimed by Peru, and as the
Chilean "claims are hot good, her statesmen feared to
submit' them to the decision of an / impartial tribunal.
As the establishment of a system of arbitration Is one
of the chief purposes for which the congress has been
called, the objection of/ Chile was formidable. More
over ii was not possible to'waive the point, for Peru,
Bolivia and Ecuador -intimated that if >the dispute
over the territories in question were not to .be sub
mitted to arbitration .they would have nothing to do
with the congress. K
FROM Washington , comes^ the report that there
is no longer any uneasiness in official circles
there concerning the success of the approaching
Pan-American; Congress which has been called to
meet in the Ci^y of Mexico next October. It seems
that Chile has withdrawn her objections to the pro
gramme of, work outlined ior the congress, and it is
now assured that every American state, large or
small, i will- be represented at the gathering. Â¦

The Hongkong dock yard is to be transferred to the foreshore
at the present torpedo depot at Tsimhatsui. Reclamation will
be made outward in a westerly direction and northward beyond
the Briquette factory, necessitating filling up of the basjn ly ng

was proposed by Admiral Morant. who foresaw the inadequate
space of this, the most Important British naval station in tnÂ«
Far East. "Work on the new dock and other improvements un
dertaken during the past few years is, therefore, a waste of a
large sum of money.
The United States Navy Department is said to be in need of

such thing as a unanimous approval 5 of the reciprocity
treaties "North, South, East and West." On the
contrary, 'there has been a widespread and- vigorous
protest against them from "every section of the coun
try. President Â¦ ; . McKinley stands for reciprocity
firmly enough, but it is Republican reciprocity and
not the kind which implies the sacrifice of the indus
tries of one section of the country for the sake. of
benefiting those of another, and consequently those
who are expecting^ him to "fight with /vigor'' for the
Kasson treaties are likely to be disappointed.
Under these every stanch and true
Republican should make it a part of his work in these
days to attend to his political duties. Those who
are not registered should register at once. Those
who have not allied themselves with" the genuine Re
publican clubs organized by the Primary League for
the purpose of bringing out a full vote at the pri
maries and maintaining honest elections should enroll
themselves without further delay. Moreover each
one should canvass the situation with his friends so
that his influence as well as his vote will be on the
side of good government. Let it be shown in the
primaries that the bosses do not rule the party, and
then the people will intrust the party with the gov
ernment of the city.
The issue is then one of the highest importance.
San Francisco despite its great advantages lags in its
career because of a lack of efficiency and fidelity in
its municipal government. Such a government as
Kelly would put into power would be in the nature
of a public calamity. Every consideration of self
interest as well as of civic patriotism therefore urges
the genuine Republicans of the city to work earnestly
and vigorously for the elimination of the bosses
from the party. It is clear that the Republicans of
San Francisco cannot assure the people of their abil
ity to provide the city with a government free from
boss rule until they have first freed their party.
It is to be borne in mind that Kelly and his crowd
are not in politics for the good of the Republican
party or for the welfare of the city. They are making
a fight' for the spoils of office and for such jobbery
as they would be able to carry through should they
succeed in putting their men in power. The whole
issue of honest municipal administration turns, there
fore, upon the defeat of the schemes which Kelly,
Herrin, Gage and Lynch have devised for their own
profit.
The meit brought from various parts of the State
to bolster up Kelly's waning power in this city,.have
now done their worst and their, best. There is
nothing more they can do. It remains to be seen
whether. Kelly, with the aid, of the Federal and State
patronage, can bring into Republican primaries
enough heelers and toughs from the slums or the
Democratic camp to carry any considerable number

THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
t- "v Y the action of the State Central Committee
r"S on Saturday there- has been presented to the
Â¦*â ' Republicans of San Francisco the plain issue
of choosing between independence or boss domina
tion. The action was not - unexpected. Perceiving
that they had no support in the city other than that
derived from the push of the dives, the bosBes sought
aid elsewhere. Through Gage and Herrin they man
aged to find it in the State Committee. .They careful
ly prepared their programme before appealing to the
committee, and when that body met the decision was
already typewritten and in the pocket of one of the
gang ready to be produced. There was no conceal
ment of the prejudgment nor any pretense at con
cealment. It was a thoroughly Kelly programme
from start to finish â bold, impudent and brazen.

The steamer Carlisle City was released
from quarantine yesterday. The vessel
arrived at San Diego over a month ago
and the captain reported that several of
his crew had died from the plague. She
was kept in quarantine ; there for seven
teen days and then came on to San Fran
cisco. /She has been-held here ten days,
and during that time; all her cargo was
discharged into lighters. She was fumi
gated Saturday and released ; yesterday
morning. ' Â»

Water Front Notes.
A. Hockheimer of Willows said he
thought . charter charges would be re
duced. Tramp steamers would force down
the price. ,
- "It comes to this," said R. J. Trumble.
"If the present rates continue no more
wheat will be raised. Farmers will no
longer farm." " . â¢' . '
. "I was much startled," Sproule said at
last, "to learn that grain rates had not
been reduced in the last fifteen years.
When I bring this to your consideration
you will remember that grain rates have
been reduced several times in the Sacra
mento Valley. The rate has been reduced
â¢from $3 50 to $2 60 from Tehama. From
Corning the rate was $3 30 and we
dropped it to $2 60. All points in the Sac
ramento Valley shared irr that. The re
duction from Willows was from $2 50 to
$2 40. We made that because â¢ of river
competition. , The Southern Pacific is not
interested in the excessive charges made
at Port Costa. The men there have struck
for 40 per cent increase In wages and have
refused an increase of 25 per ., cent. I
simply say this to show Â¦ our farmer
friends that if we can reduce our unload
ing chargÂ«s at Port. Costa we will do so.
In 1894 the charter rate was 20 shillings;
to-day It is 40 shillings. It seems to me
that as our rates go down charter rates
go up. If the wars In China, the Philip
pines and South Africa were ended ships
would be released and charters would
drop. We believe that the present rate
is as low as we can possibly make it. If
we carried wheat free to Port Costa
charter rates would be raised, and we
cannot see that the railroad Is respon
sible for the. present conditions."
Says Bates Were Reduced.
"If the low prices for wheat hold, thou
sands of acres will go back to grazing,"
Beekman said.
"What are the factors that have
brought about that condition?" asked
Sproule.
"There are several." Briggs replied.
"We have reduced rents and the interest
rate. The land-owner and the money-lender
are trying to get together. It is true that
the yield has increased with putting water
on the land, but the farmer has to pay
for water. Every man in the nation is
protected except the farmer. The farmer
has to pay more for his implements than
he did years ago. He has to pay 40 shill
ings on wheat to London, and Is getting
less for wheat than v he did twenty years
ago. Your people can well afford to look
into this matter, for I will tell you frank
ly that if present conditions continue there
will be only one farmer in the San
Joaquin Valley where there were once
three. On our 30,000-acre tract we have
not one farmer who -would not throw up
farming if he could do it.' -
William Beekman of Sacramento said
that much land in his county that had
once been in wheat was now in weeds.
The same could be" said of lands in Yolo
and Glenn. â¢ â¢ - .
Sproule Asks a Question.
There was some further discussion and
then, at the suggestion of W. S. Green, it
was agreed to ask the railroad people for
a flat reduction of 25 per cent. The gen
tlemen present then opened their batteries
on Sproule, all endeavoring to show that
the present charges were exorbitant and
that the reduction asked for was reason
able. A. R. Briggs of Fresno said:
"I handle 30,000 acres in my county that
is good grain land, well watered and with
rich soil, but each year hundreds of acres
is taken out of grain. In the last three
years wheat has steadily run the farmers
into debt."
"The railroad charges us the same rate
for. hauling our wheat now that it did
fifteen > years ago, when wheat was worth
$1 50. Wheat has come down, but the
freight rates are the same. We want to
ask the railroad to do something for the
State, and not to kill the wheat industry.
We 'bought land at exorbitant prices in
Sacramento and Glenn counties, and now
we are paying 15 cents for putting wheat
on the cars, 10 cents for unloading It and
8 cents for running it on the scales. The
tariff of $2 40 a ton is simply ruinous. Un
less there is a reduction we will all have
to go out of business, and the offered re
('.uctlon of 10 cents a ton is an absurdity."
These words, spoken by William
Sproule, .freight traffic manager of the
Southern Pacific, .were the net result o*
a conference called at the Board of Trade
rooms Saturday morning by the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association.
There were present at the meeting mer
chants, farmers and bankers, interested
in the present condition of the farming
Industry in the Sacramento and San Joa
quin valleys, and Mr. Sproule. The wheat
growers asked for a flat reduction of 26
per cent in the rates charged by the rail
road company for carrying wheat from
all points in the valleys to. tide water at
Port Costa. It was said by men present
who knew what they were talking about
that, owjng to the present rates on wheat,
farms in Glenn and Colusa counties were
being abandoned, and those farmers who
staid by their wheat land were much
closer to starvation than was at all pleas
ant. The principal grievance against the
railroad company was the charge made
for loading, unloading and weighing. It
was claimed that the company charges
growers at Willows 15 cents for loading
wheat on the cars, 10 cents for unloading
it and 8 cents for ' weighing. This is by
the ton, and the charges. were deemed ex
orbitant. .
The meeting was presided over by W.
P. Green, president of the Sacramento De
velopment Association. P. R. Garnett of
Willows, in speaking of the situation,
said:
"We believe that the present rate is as
low as we can possibly make It. "We can
not see that the railroad is responsible for
the present condition." \

CAKLAND ELKS WIN
THE SECO3HT> GAME
Santa Rosa Team Goes Down in De-
feat Before the Athenian
Aggregation.' '
OAKLAND. July 21.â The Oakland Elks
won the second came of their series with
the Santa Rosa team at the league
grounds ai^Golden Gate this afternoon.
This is a bad habit that the Oakland team
has got into lately, and while they are
hospitable to visitors in their lodgerooms
it Is different when they get on the ball
field.
The Oakland Elks met Santa Rosa once
before. They went up to . the thriving
Sonoma County town arid played a game
of baseball with the home . team. Oak
land won because . the Santa Rosa boys
said they could not violate the rules of
hospitality, but they would like to meet
their victors on their home grounds. So
the Santa Rosa Elks came to Oakland to
day prepared to do all kinds of things to
the boys of No. 171. .
Manager Jack Mathews put his mascot
suit on and rounded up his team of all
stars and said that visitors or no visitor*
it was a case of Oakland must win. And
Oakland did win, for the score was 14 to 2
in favor of the Oakland Warn.
Oakland has an almost perfect record,
having been beaten only by Los Angeles
once and Stockton once. . . *.

TRAP SHOOTING
AT INGLESIDE
Runner Up Shows No Desire
â¢ to Win and Is Easily
Defeated.
T. J. Cronin's Vandal won the open
stake yesterday at Union Park by beat
ing E. Geary's Palo- Alto in the deciding
round by a score of 14 to 2. The many
kind things that have been said of Palo
Alto in days gone by were more than off
set by the united opinion of the crowd
that watched the sprinter give up all in
terest In the game and let hia opponent
win as he pleased. While Vandal deserves*
credit for the snappy work he did
throughout the stake still there are many
dogs that never get beyond a second
round that could have beaten the Palo
Alto erf yesterday's final. The pair was
slipped to a hare of the speedy class that
gave them a record run and then escaped
when the dogs were at even points. In
the run off Palo Alto showed, his speeil
and from the start led Vandal three
lengths. He had not gone far, however,
when, he showed a disposition to "give up
all claim on first money, and as a result
Vandal twice scored a go by. Such an ex
hibition by a champion was never seen be
fore, and Palo Alto will have to do soma
wonderful work in the future to efface
the memory of the ignominious defeat.
The two points that were credited to the
Io3er were entirely complimentary- and
were made by the hare's favor. â¢
Vandal's work of late shows considera
ble Improvement and speaks well for Bill.
Shear, under whose care the courser has
been able to get the big slices of the
money. . . . â¢
P. J. Reilly's Honesty showed her old
time stake winning form and landed in
third place which, considering her long,
lay-off. Is a great performance. That she
did not beat Palo Alto In the semi-final
is due to. the fact that Alto was well fa
vored by the hare. - She was one of the big
surprises of the stake, having taken tlva
flag from Dewdrop, a 5 to 1 favorite.
Bonnie Pasha beat Fine Fire, a choice
at 4 to L. pointless. Sir Pasha performed
well throughout and reached the semi

TO ARRIVE.
j*=^ ACRAMENTO. July 21.â To the
(L^_^ sincere regret of a host of friends
and well-wishers, not only in.Sac-
ramento but throughout Califor-
J nia, James A. â¢ Barwick, the ob
server for . the United States .Weather
Bureau in this city, will leave in August
for Denver. The transfer has been made
at his own reauest on. account of his
health, Â¦which has not, been good since the
severe attack of illness he experienced in
1896, when from excessive mental work
and worry and protracted physical ex
ertion â¢ in connection \ with the Â¦ State
Â¦weather service his .system broke, down
and for weeks he hovered between life
and death.
Mr. Barwick has been in continuous
charge of the Sacramento meteorological
fc-^>s3HERE was a peculiar accident on
I the front yesterday. By nls pres-
I ence of mind In . jumping at the
11 right moment a young man saved
himself , from probably fatal inju
ries or maybe instant death.
Harry Weeks, a â¢ sailor on one of the
coasting rchooiTers, was at work 'on the
roof of a house in the rear of the building
en the corner of East and Clay streets.
Assisted by his -father, he was clearing
away some rubbish that had accumulated
and tearing down some planks that were
in the way. One of the bgards came
away easily, and Weeks Jr.,.who\was ex
pecting some' resistance; lost ;hls balance.'
Finding himself falling, he jumped away
from the roof and landed on his feet in
the yard, fifty feet below. Thinking he
was at sea. Harry instinctively jumped in
order to fall clear of the ship, and so in
all probability raved -his life. .
The father got down -from the roof, as
quickly as possible and at once brought
assistance. The young man was removed'
to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Mur
phy found that both his ankles were
(broken and that there were a number; of
contusions on his body. There is a pos
sibility of internal Injuries, but young
Weeks says -he is. all right save for his
broken limbs. * â¢'- - '-Â¦-.Â¦
The naval training â¢ ship Alert came
down from the navy yard and, will prob
ably sail for Yokohama to-morrow. She
has 124 apprentice boys aboard who are
going out on thoir maiden cruise. The
Alert was thought to be ready for sea
several weeks ago, but at the last minute
her condensers were fqund to be-out of
order and she taken to the navy yard.
Loading "Wheat Under Difficulties. "
. The British ship Chlpperkyle was : to
have been loaded and ready for sea nearly
a week ago. When all of her -cargo of
wheat eave about 500 tons was Â¦ aboard
the longshoremen'struck and the ship was
tied up. Thursday last the men agreed
to finish the vessel and let her go,' but did
not keep their promise. . Saturday Fred
Wilson, manager for Stewart Menssies, de
cided to finish the loading of the vessel
himself. He got together- thirty sailors
and took them to Port Costa on alaunch.
At daybreak they were at work loading
wheat into the Chipperkyle and by. the
afternoon the ship was^ loaded. She will
come down in^ja the stream to-day and
will probably sail for Europe .Wednesday.
â¢Wilson paid the men 5 cents an hour more
than the longshoremen had been getting,
and he is so well satisfied with their, work
that he is going to keep them at Port
Costa to finish the loading of the remain
der of the fleet. . .

The British' ship Albania Is now out 207
days from Riode Janeiro for Manila, and
last week, the underwriters were paying

The Albania left New;York on September
11 for Manila, but" was caught :m- heavy

Shanghai, 'and the underwriters are pay
ing 30 per cent to reinsure her chances.
She sailed from New. York on February 2,
and after discharging at Shanghai' was to
have come to San Francisco to load grain
for Europe. Â¦ ( . &BggJiaSifii
station since March 15, 1S81, and^ his serv
ices during the twenty years. have been of
large benelit to the agricultural and fruit
interests of the State. Soon. after his as
suming the. duties. of his station he sug
gested and" with the assistance of Edwin
F. Smith, secretary of the- State Agricul
tural Society; instituted the 'system \pt
making meteorological .'observations - and
gathering statistics- throughout the State,
which proved of incalculable value to the
farmers and fruit growers as. well as to
scientific men. For , this service alone
California owes him a large debt of grati
tude. V ; . , i J . . .
* In 1S91, wheri a State weather service
was --instituted---by -the -United States
Weather Bureau at Washington, Mr. Bar
wick was placed at the head' of It for
California, which position he continued to
fill until the transfer of the central office
to San Francisco in 1897. < His monthly re
ports and - weekly - crop . bulletins were
models of . completeness and accuracy. ' ;
When the transfer was made in 1897 Mr.
Barwick received more than a hundred
letters from voluntary observers- all over
the -State expressing, their .regret "at the
change. ...A; large number of. these observ
ers had .been -reporting, to; him from >as
far. back. as 1882. ;' r '-Â¦ .;
Some -weeks ago .on .the advice of his
physician. Mr. Barwick asked for a trans
fer to Charlotte, N. C. The way. not be
ing open to him, hewas offered a station
at Madlna, Colorado, but finally settled
on the one at Denver, to. which he goes
as assistant observer. The J change is a
promotion.
Â¦ Mr.- Barwick has a twenty days' leave of
absence from August 1, and will leave

Srh Francisco* 1, Oakland O.
The Oaklands suffered an attack of real
hard luck yesterday afternoon, at Recrea
tion Park, accepting the short end of a
% one-to-nothing score, though they secured
more hits and had as many chances as their
opponents. Mdore's unfortunate error In
the fourth inning was responsible for
their defeat, he making a bad throw to
first, putting Croll on the base -when he
should have been out.
It was another great pitchers' battle be
tween Iburg and Hodson. the last named
coming out on top. notwithstanding 1 the
fact that his team lost. The locals ob
tained but three hits off his delivery, not
a single free pass and three struck. out.
Iburg on the other hand allowed five safe
hits, walked three of his opponents and
suffered six of the Dudes to fan the air.
Croll made the only run in the game
during the fourth round. He made first
on Moore's bad throw to Eagan, advanced
to second on Hlldebrand's sacrifice and
cnxne home on Moore's second error, amid
the cheering and applause of the local
fans. Krug next got a base on Francks'
error, but Xordyke ended it by an easy
one to Arrellaaes.
The remainder of the game was played
with few startling events on either side.
The Benedicts secured hits In the fourth,
sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth innings,
but they failed to bring a man home, i
though they had a few chances of doing
fo. Thev suffered their usual run of hard
1 uck. " Y cungey" Johnson certainly exerted i
himself to his utmost, handing out pack>
agres of his choicest "hot air," and even
Baying prayers to stave off defeat, but all
to no purpose, as the "Jonah" was on
him.
"Josh" Reilly particularly distinguished
himself in the sixth, making a beautiful
one-hand stop and retiring the runner at 1
first base. In the seventh he got up left
har.dcd, had two strikes called on him and
thon smashed out a clean double to right
field, the only one of the game.
Mr. Graves, who officiates in the capa
city of umpire, should purchase for him
self a first-class telescope, so that he may
rÂ»e able to see Â¦whether a runner is on a
base or not. He called Krug out on a
double play at first, when A Heine" was
on the base fully five seconds before the
ball reached Eagran's glove. On balls and
strikes he Â¦was better, but his work all
amund could be improved upon.
The dust blew around in enormous
clouds, much to- the discomfort of both
ppectators and players. The crowds will
certainly drop off if something is not done
to stop thi?, and the sooner done the
bptter.
The Germans wfll Journey to Los Ange
les to battle with the Looloos for the next
Ferfef. v.hile Oakland and Sacramenio will
play at Recreation Park. -The next series
begins on Thursday afternoon. Following

This refinery started in, however, with the

finery has been consuming about 1000 barrels a
day of crude oil, with eight stills of 150 barrels

to supply the demand for asphaltum, and eight
more stills have been installed, doubling the
capacity of the refinery, while orders received
by the company for asphaltum guarantee It a

of Stockton are trying- to secure money
to drill an experimental well for oil in the
foothill region east of ' Stockton. They
urge upon the people that if oil is struck
it will result in building up a large
amount of manufacturing by supplying
cheap fuel. According to the plan an
nounced by the oil . company of â¢ which
they are directors, the sale of stock will
cease as soon as money enough Is se
cured to drill the first' well; A tract of
840 acres has been bonded. '
.There fere' several recent indications
pointing to the fact that the demand for
California petroleum is certain to Increase
in many directions. The action of the re
clamation districts of the lower Sacra
mento River, which .will substitute oil for
coal at pumping plants and on dredgers,
involves an additional demand for ' 75,000
barrels of oil per annum. The smelter at
Keswick uses oil for fuel. The Sunset Oil
Refining Company's plant at Oblspo, so
says the Los Angeles Herald, requires 2000
barrels per day for refining. This Is about
two-thirds of the total daily output of the
Los Angeles local field. The Los Angeles
people believe that the problem of pro
ducing illuminating oil has been satisfac
torily solved., "It is not generally known
perhaps," says the Los Angeles Herald,
"but it is a fact that the unmixed illum

Tepper's Bold Evasion.
The Hermitage and Nellson's licenses
do not expire until next month, and these
places had a legitimate right to sell liquor,
though there were no manifestations of
rowdyism around them during the day.
Bauhoffer's .place was almost deserted
throughout the day, and the absence of
the hundreds who have made It their ref
uge Sunday after Sunday caused It to
look quite dismal. However, there were
a few visitors, and these were supplied
openly with drink. Some, few people made
their headquarters In the rear of Taylor's
saloon and drank beer, though the pro
prietor said that they were only friends
of his whom ha had invited to help him
consume his surplus stock of liquors.
J. A. Nolan, who was formerly a liquor
drummer, paraded and spoke with the
Anti-saloon League this afternoon, and In
the; evening delivered an address In the
Presbyterian Church. \

CALL. BUREAU. 1406 O STREET. N.
W., "WASHINGTON, July 21.â Retaliatory
legislation may be enacted by Congress If
the German Government yields to the de
mar.il of Agrarians and Imposes the ' pro
posed Increased duties on farm products.
Representations may be made to Ger
many through Embassador White, pro
testing in diplomatic language aga'nht the
proposed Increase of duty, but the Presi
dent can go no further. There can bo no
retaliation without action by Congress, as
there is nothing; in the present law au
thorizing the executive department to>
adopt such measures, except to a very
limited extent.
, Paragraph 628 of the Dlngley law pro
vides for the imposition of duty on petro
leum imported from countries Imposing
duties on American petroleum, and sec
tion 5 of that law provides for the imposi
tion of countervailing duties on articles
for exportation of which from the country
of their production a bounty is paid.
Neither of these provisions would be of
any use In meeting the proposed action
of Germany.
While the new German duties are to be
general and apply equally to imports from
all countries, it is felt here they are aimed
especially at the United ' States, for the
reason that the.y are to be Imposed upon
goods imported chiefly from thi3 country.
If these new duties are imposed it will be
consistent with the policy which the
Agrarians have succeeded In forcing upon
the general Government for many years,
the same policy which led to restrictions
upon the importation of American meats
and American fruits. Both the executive
and Congress have- chafed under this
hostile attitude of Germany toward
.American goods, but no retaliatory action
has been taken, though at the time of the
prohibition of Imoortatiort'."of American
fruits several years ago, on the plea, that
there was Â¦ danger of the introduction of
the San Jose scale Into Germany, the
Ways and Means Committee of the House
of Representatives went so far as to pro
pose- a bill retaliating on German imports
into the United States. A modification of
the German order was secured, however,'
and the project was dropped.

The twenty-two-inch mill at the Boston
iron and ateel plant of the National Tube
Company at McKeesport Â¦will resume op

lasting three weeks. The plant was closed
for repairs.
Last night I received a. telegram from, one
of our men at Duncans vine saying: "Dun
cansville Is out." At any time within the
year we could have formed a compact organi
zation of the mill there. They have sent ua
dozens of letters and a number of telegrams
declaring their anxiety to Join our cause.
Things are very much better than I thought
they would be. More mills are shut down than
we anticipated or could expect. There Is rnorÂ«
determination upon the part of the men than
was -anticipated. There has been more in
clination to aid as morally and financially on
the part of the other labor organizations and
vastly more support from the- general public
than - we were looking for.
"When seen to-night President Shaffer
expressed himself as being more than sat
isfied with the week's results. He said:
"PITTSBURG, July 2L-The important

It was decided that graduates who nle appli
cations before the 1st of August. 1901, may be
registered as licentiates without examination.
JOHN CALVERT, Secretary.
This much was accomplished by the
publication of The Call's, story regarding
the methods of the State Board of Phar
macy: The graduates of the. -California
College of Pharmacy will - bo reg
istered as licentiates without the vexation
of an extra examination at the hands of
the board. The first of Tho Call's articles
was printed on July 17. On the day be
fore that John Calvert, secretary of the
board, informed a representative of The
Call that all graduates, without excep
tion," must take examination at the hands
of the board.
On the day of the publication of that
article the same representative of The
Call was Informed by the State Board of
Pharmacy, In full conclave; that It had
been .ruled at the June meeting 1 of the
board that graduates in pharmacy would:
be licensed without examination. It was
intimated in The Call's story of July 18
that the board, despite this solemn declar
ation, had amended Its rules so as to'ad
mit these graduates on the day of the
publication of The Call's first article, and
because of that publication.
Now comes John Calvert, secretary of
the board, with the following communica

LONDON TRADERS
MORE CHEERFUL
Stock Exchange Remains
Steady Despite Ad
verse Reports.
?
LONDON. July 21.-The Stock Ex
change, after beginning the week that
has just passed with about the worst pos
sible prospects, ended it with a decidedly
more cheerful tone. Among the numerous
depressing influences which marked the
earlier part of the week were the adverse
reports from Peking, the drought, the
steel strike in the United States and to
the growing: disgust in Great Britain of
the weak and the seemingly ineffective
administration of the South African war.
The -capture of the Reitz-Steyn corre
spondence had a more exhilarating effect
upon London traders than the facts
seemed to warrant, having In â¢view the
circumstances that the captured letters
contained much ancient history, and the
further circumstance that so little In the
way of real advance has been made since
May 1. However, Kaffirs had been want
ing a tangible excuse to advance for some
time and the capture of the correspond
ence answered the purpose.
There is a general feeling, also, that the
war cannot possibly continue much long
er and that therefore, whoever wishes to
profit by the advance which will follow
the conclusion of the war must secure
Africans earls*.
The general situation was helped by the
confidence displayed In New York In spite
of the steel strike and by the announce
ment of the adjustment of the Northern
Pacific dispute.
London, as has been usual recently, fol
lowed New York's lead in the American
section. On the other hand, home rails
realized about the worst prophecies as to
the half-year dividend and the showing
of other industrials was either, stagnant
or only slightly higher, with the excep
tion of Bryant and May shares, which
fell off 13 points, as a result of. what is
regarded as the surrender of the directors
to the Americans.
Consols recovered 2 points from the ex
treme decline.
The Bank of England's reserve Is now
nearly Â£25.000.000 and Is Increasing. Money
is decidedly lower.
LAKE BOAT STRUCK
â¢ BY LIGHTNING AND LOST
Crew of Large Schooner or Barge
Believed to Save
Perished.
MARINETTE. Wis.. July 21.-During a
severe electrical storm to-day a boat sup
posed tc be a large schooner or steam
barge was struck by lightning and de
stroyed by fire, and her crew is thought
to have been lost. The Hghtkecper at
Menominee saw the boat burning just
south of Green Inland. He called up the
local fire tug and the latter started out
to render any assistance possible. When
about three miles out all signs of the
boat on fire suddenly disappeared, and an
examination afterward showed no wreck
age. The nearest land is Green Island
and the crew, if they escaped with their
lives, would have gone there. There was
a heavy sea running and it would have
been Impossible for a small boat to live
in It. The boat was on her way here
from the Sturgeon Bay canal, and was
undoubtedly one of the Chicago or Mil
waukee lumber carriers. Communication
with Sturgeon Bay to-night fails to es
tablish the Identity of the lost craft-
Making: Trouble ,for Exporters.
WASHINGTON. July 21.â In a com
munication to the State Department Con-
sul Warner at Leipsic, Germany, states
that it is reported that the Reichstag will
pass a law compelling American exporters
to Germany to make out Invoices covering
the shipments, these invoices to be
authenticated by the German Consul in
the United States In whose, district the
goods are produced. * It Is alleged that
euch a -course will help- the officials in
perfecting the- statistics of the Imports
from the jjnltefi States.. It will, it is stat
ed_~also another obstacle in the
way of American exports to Germany.
MINING FIELDS
WIN INVESTORS
Money Put Into Work
of Extensions and
Purchases.
Development Goes on With
. Briskness While the
Water Runs.
New mining enterprises and the exten
sion of operations by old companies are
reasonably numerous and fairly large.
! Closely following the news of the deal in
volving the Sweepstakes property comes
a report of the location by a San Fran
cisco company of 1300 acres in Trinity
County, between Rush Creek and Browns
Creek. The company has secured 5000
Inches of water and will carry it through
', Buckeye Mountain by tunnel. In the
j mother lode country there is some stir
; over the copper proposition known as the
i Moon mine, on Stony Creek, about six
miles from Jackson. Copper indications
'have teen, traced some distance. Going
' to the southern country the indications of
i interest are also marked. Two deals of
i some size are reported to be pending in
j San Barnardino County. The properties in
â¢ volved are the O. K. mine of Virginia
! Dale and copper mine Oro Grande. In
j the first instance 5250,000 is reported to be
j the price. Salt Lake people are the re
Â¦ puted purchasers of the copper proper
ties; the price is not mentioned. All
i along the line there Is a marked revival
! of interest as compared with the fcondl
i tions of one year ago.
I . To Renew Tin Mining.
j Another attempt will be made to ' pro
j due tin xin paying quantites In Califor
! nia. The Temescal tin property, in the
{ Temescal Mountains, south of Corona,
1 has not been operated for some years. It
j was cwned by a syndicate. " A new loca- ,
tion to search for tin has been selected by
! Los Angeles people. It Is in Orange
County, on the south slope of the Temes
cal Mountains.
The water supply in Tuolumne County
is reported to be good for some months
yet: in fact, until late into the season.
There Is a large quantity of snow In the
) high Sierras yet to melt. Some of the
j mine superintendents say that they will.
have sufficient water to run until fall.
Tho .property of the Melones Mining
j Company, according to -the Magnet, has
I been bonded for $4<XM)00 to raise money to
carry out improvements. Work has be
gun on the first twenty stamps for the
biff mill. . .
The Beatrice mine, near Murphys, Cal
averas County, will resume. A force of
men Is doing the preliminary work. The
old Calaveras mine, is being pumped out.
The Amador Record says:
The new mining: enterprise at Upper Ran
cheria Is progressing In good shape. Fifteen
men are employed and machinery capable of
crushing 250 tons per day of the cement gravel
is belns installed. It is claimed that if the
gravel yields only *1 or so per ton It will prove
a paying proposition. That section of the
county was noted for its gold deposits in early
days, but of late years only in a small way
has any mining been carried on. Eastern peo
1 pie are behind the rresent enterprise. C. H.
i Richards of New York, who makes his head-
I quarters at this place. Is general manager for
the company. In addition to their other hold-
I ings Mr. Richards has Juet completed for his
company the purchase of the "W. H. Glenn
ranch, mining ground and ditches, consisting
of 10S acres.
A. G. Stephens of Oakland has pur
chased the Tonzi mine in the Mt. Echo dis
trict. Amador County, the price being
$30,000. Stephens represents a syndicate.
The Amador Dispatch says: /
Captain W. H. Glenn of Upper Rancherla
was In Jackson Tuesday having the records
searched and -papers 'prepared for- the transfer
I of his gravel mining ground in Rancheria dis
trict to a New York company. Captain Glenn
Â¦was associated In the ownership of the prop
erty with Messrs. Bray and Barling, and they
have disposed of their Interests also. The
claim is known bs the old Blue Gravel Lead,
and is both a surface and deep mine.
Decision Is Interesting 1 .
United States Judge Wellborn : has de
cided at Los Angeles that mining and
smelting: companies are subject to the
rights and privileg-es of the bankruptcy
laws and may be thrown into bankruptcy
upon petition, exactly as any other manu
facturing concern. The Los Angeles Times
gives an account of the facts in the case
in which the decision was rendered as fol
lows:
The Question came up In the bankruptcy pro
ceedings of the Tecopa Mining- and Smelting
Company, In which one of the creditors, T. A.
Brown of San Bernardino, asked that the ad
judication be set aside on the ground that min
ing and smelting companies did not come
under the act, which lists those persons and
corporations' that are amenable, and does not
include mining and smelting. E. T. Dunning
of the "Wholesalers' Board of Trade appeared
as attorney of the creditors who wished to
have the company declared bankrupt, and ar
gued' that Â£ melting was manufacturing. This
view was upheld by Referee Stephens, who
handed down a long opinion showing that the
producing of "pig" or bullion from ore Is ac
tually forming something useful with the aid
of hands and machinery, and hence is clearly
manufacturing. This opinion does not. how
ever, carry with it, according to the wording
of the findings of fact and law, the proposition
tfcat mining alone is manufacturing.
According to the Shasta County Demo
crat the management of the Mount Shasta
Mines Company is negotiating for the pur
chase of more land. Recently the company
purchased from Joseph Kahny and D.
Lees a one-quarter interest in 120 acres
of land on both sid'es of Clear Creek, ad- :
joining the Mount Shasta property and
owned by Kahny, Lees, N. D.' Fowler and
H. M. Le Baron. It is tne three-quarter
interest of Fowler and Le Baron that the
Mount Shasta people are now negotiating
for. It is said the company desires this
property so they can put in a power plant
on Clear Creek with which to furnish
power for the new mill and machinery
which is to be installed at the Mount
Shasta mine. : . â¢ . : -â¢
"Working on Properties.
The Mountain Democrat reports that the
new twenty-stamp mill at the River Hill
mine is completed. The River Hill Com
pany has begun development work on the
Lucky Star mine, one of the properties
recently acquired by the company at Pov
erty Point.
The Calumet mining property near KesÂ»
wick will be operated again, so says the
Redding Free Press. The mill was recently
destroyed by fire; Almarin B. Paul and
Dr. W. H. Garlick are Interested In the
property. The mine has been. idle about
ten years.
A review of the history of the mines of
I^eadvllle is made by the Dally Mining
Record,' "published at Colorado Springs.
The first gdld to. be discovered in the Lead
vllle district was- found in 1861, In the sum
mer, at the headwaters of the Arkansas
River, which later became known as Cal
ifornia. Gulch. Since then rover $20,000,000
in gold has been taken from the aurifer
ous beds, which- are still yielding, gold.
The first important discovery of carbon
ates-was' made'at' Fryer Hill, occurring
first as rich chlorides of silver, lying In
blanket formation immediately under the
Burface. In the last -.decade large gold
bodies have been discovered In Â¦ the same
locality. The Record makes the claim
that Leadvllle has produced $250,000,000 and
is now breaking Its past record. ;; '
The Pacific Coast Miner sees a great
boom for the gold-dredging - industry ,-in
the north: ... â¢_. .
The pold 4 dredging Industry may Â¦ count 'on
being helped by the attention being drawn' td
the Trinity County gravel deposits by the re-'
cent important sale of the Sweepstakes prop
erty ana the succeeding development. Trinity
County has enormous deposits of auriferous
cravtla and a great amount of them is very
favorably adapted to gold dredging, aa success
ful dredging has proved. .The more the atten
tion of capital is turned to these great placer
fields the more gold dredges will be Installed,

UPPER FRUITVALE RESORTS THRIVE
DESPITE REVOCATION OF LICENSE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALt,' MONDAY, JULY 22, 1901.
OAKLAND, July 21.â Regardless of
the fact that they had been shorn
of their licenses to sell intoxicating
liquors, all but lone of the pro-,
prietors of the Upper Frultvale
resorts kept open house to-day. Beer and
other intoxicants were to be had in any
thing from a keg to a mug under the
guise of "root beer." Young boys and
women reeled around in a drunken con
dition in Tepper's place yelling lustily, but
there were none of the disgraceful scenes
that have characterized Upper Frultvale
during the summer months. Comparative
'quiet reigned on account of the few peo
ple who visited the place, many -being un
der the impression that the. joints were
closed for good. ' .
Tepper's and Bauhoffer's places were
run in violation of the law. The li
censes of the proprietors have been re
voked by the Board of Supervisors, yet
they continue the sale of liquors.
R. E. Taylor, who also lost his license,
alone obeyed the mandate of the Super
visors by keeping his doors locked.

FORT PILL* O. T,, July a.â Disorder
and distress will, it la feared, follow the
actual opening of the Kiowa-Coraanche
reservation on August 6. It Is now esti
mated that fully 150,000 people will have
registered for a chance to- secure one of
the 13,000 claim* to be awarded by lottery
when the registration booths close July 28.
Thousands of persons now on the reserva
tion who are neither mechanics nor arti
sans nnd who have little or no money an
nounco their Intention of locatts around
Lawton If they fall to win a claim. Camp
ers who came Jn prairie schooners by the
thousands generally brought with them
provisions sufficient only to last from five
to ten days. Continued drought has
caused the water to be restricted, and for
days a hot wind hnÂ» blown uvcr the pral
rlcs. The temperature hns avern?ed over
tho 100 mark. With those conditions be
foro them many are already beginning to
grumble, and when this is followed by
disappointment over failure to draw a
lucky number the hope that bore many up
will doubtless bIvg way to more serious
conditions.
Food and Water Are Scarce,
and Grumbling Has
Commenced.

ASK ' REINSTATEMENT \ OF: MEN.
Car Employes Ask That Discharged
Union Members Be Taken Sack. .
Every member jf of the Car Employes'
Union, which was very quietly organized
some two months ago, has been requested
to sign a petition asking -.the reinstate
ment of the twenty-five men who were
discharged ; by the Market-Street -Com
pany a few^ ..days ago on -account, of their
union affiliations. , Since, then a number
ori>the otheri lines of .the company* have
been, quietly: dismissed,^.:^? -i- .
The method'of forming 1 " the union -was
a peculiar one. A few of the men met
with an Eastern organizer 'and effected an
organization, applied for and received a
charter. Â¦ Then, .during the off-hours ' of
the conductQrs and gripmen,~ representa
tives of the union would visit their homes,

a BOUT S00 members of the Brother
i\ hood of Teamsters will report for
jLj\ Â¦ work this morning at their va
Â«f rious places of employment. This
is the estimate made by the of
ficers of the brotherhood, and it includes
every man who on Saturday night was
not notified by his employer to "obey or
ders or quit."
A meeting of the teamsters was held in
the Turk-street Temple early yesterday
morning and the situation* was thoroughly
discussed. After the meeting adjourned
the executive committee held an all-day
end all-night session at the headquarters,
Â«o72 Fourth street, where the men not al
teady discharged were given instructions
as to* the course to pursue. The. general
trend of thess instructions was, "Report
for work in the mornlne, but do not haul
anything for the Morton Drayage Com
pany."
The executive committee- of the Dray
men'^ Arscciation had a meeting at the
eame aimc and decided to put in force the
same.tule of policy that obtained on Sat
urday. Such men as return to work will
be given their orders to do certain work.
If they refuse each one will be sent to his
. barn and after Ills team is turned in will
be paid off. The representatives of the
teamsters say that if one man u. dis
charged the "whole Jiarn" will go out.
This/will result probably in a tie-up be
fore, noor. of every .drayage. firm in the
city.
There Is one body )ot. men that looks on
complacently at the pending struggle.
These are the independent express men,
who are not connected *.j"ith any union.
While the number of these wagens and
their carrying capacity is limited, still
Borne of the congestion of freight may be
relieved by employing them. It is claimed
by the teamsters that one firm alone can
handle as much freight in one day as all
the express wagons In the city and that
they do not fear any serious competition
from this source. I\>one of these wagons
are -built for the carrying of heavy freight.

DR. C. E. COOPER
. After' a long 1 and stormy voyage on j the
matrimonial sea, months spent In the di
vorce court and the Incidental troubles at
tendant thereon, J. G. Taylor, a wealthy
cattleman of Nevada, accompanied by a
friend, went to Larkspur yesterday after
noon â¢ and took f roni the custody of his
wife his two eons, aged 8 and 11 years.
The affair was conducted, so quietly that
the mother had no suspicion of her . loss
until the: deed was ' accomplished. Last
night Mrs. Taylor made a vain . search
for the children that were awarded to her
custody by, the court at the time of the
divorce.""'.- .::Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦ Â¦: â¢Â» â¢ ; *â¢ Â»'.
3 When Taylor was a humble buyer of
cattle all .went well. A lucky turn In the
market .brought money and with it trou
ble. Mrs. Taylor sued for a divorce on the
ground of desertion, ; the husband not
contesting the suit. A 1 decree of divorce
was granted, and the custory of the
children was given to the mother. "She
was granted a settlement of $10,000 and an
allowance of $75 a month for the care of
the children. . - â¢â¢ .
Some months ago Mrs. Taylor, with the
two children, left San Mateo to take up
her residence In Larkspur. Yesterday a
message was received by her Inviting her
to spend the day with friends in San
Francisco. She left her children with
friends and came to the city to enjoy, her-
Hardly had Mrs. Taylor left' the" sum
mer resort when her former husband ap
peared. Accompanied by a friend he
walked. up the only street that Larkspur
boasts and found his children playing in
front of the house where they were living..
"Oh, papa." cried the elder, and the
brother joined in the glad refrain.
/ "Come along with me boys and we will
take a ride to the city," said the father.
He .grasped one youngster by the hand
and his friend the otheT, and the. next
train out brought them to San Franfiiseo.
It was some hours later when Mrs.-Tay
lor heard that her children had, been
taken . from her. The people with whom
she was stopping missed them about the
usual time for meals and made inquiries.
They learned that while the' children were
playing in the street they were ap
proached by , two men. and accompanied
them to the train. . So quietly was the
matter accomplished that but little atten
tion was paid to it. -
Alarmed at the long: absence . of the
children, their temporary guardian noti
fied Mrs. Taylor and she returned to
Larkspur, at once. By persistent inquiry
she declared that her former husband
was the man who took her children, and
endeavored to head him off. but without
avail. \- . .
Â¦ Taylor claims that his wife has, by freÂ»
quently changing her place of residence,
kept his children from him. He has other
accusations, he says, to make, and now
that 'his children are in his custody pro
poses to take them out of. the jurisdiction
of tMe California courts.
