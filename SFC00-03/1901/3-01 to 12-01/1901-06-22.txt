ITHACA, rs. T., June 21.â President
Schurman of Cornell .-University, in
his a.ddress to the graduatirigclass",
praised American millionaires, who
hold their wealth as stewards of the
people, mentioning Carnegie and < Rocke
feller. He declared, however, that, ', save
in politics and invention, America was
far behind the countries of Europe, es
pecially in the domain ef higher culture.
President Schurman said in part:"
" "Look at the gifts which Mr. Rockefel
ler and Mr. Carnegie are making for
churches, schools, colleges," universities
*and librariesâ gifts which assume the pro
portions of millions of dollars for a sin
gle object. Mr. Carnegie, preaches the
gospel of wealth, which makes it a dis
grace for a man to die rich; and. if he
li\-es long enough to carry out his pur
poses, I doubt not his life will "illustrate
his teaching.
"That our richest men have come to re
gard wealth as a trust which they hold
for the benefit of their fellovr-men may be
regarded by the future historian of Amer
ican civilization as the most significant
feature of our day. The American habit
of giving to coileges and ' universities is
one of the two most encouraging features
of our intellectual life. The other is the
public school, In which the children of the
people are freely educated at the "expense
of the people.
Lacking in Higher Culture!
"Undoubtedly we may well be proud of
all the material egencies and instrumen-
"Let me speak with the utmost frank
ness. Apart from the domain of politics.
Invention and trade, America has â¢ not
produced a single man or woman whose
name will- shine in the intellectual firma
ment with ; Raphael, Shakespeare, Coper
nicus, Newton, La - Place, Goethe and
Darwin. *f*
"While we congratulate ourselves on the
prosperity of the nation, on the benefi
cence of its rich men, on the multitude of
our schools, colleges and universities, and
the variety of excellence of their appli-
When questioned to-night regarding the
'statements In his commencement address,
President Schurman said:'
"It is undoubtedly true that An America
there â. have been first y class creative
productions, of the human mind like those
of -Dante, , Shakespeare, ."Goethe , and/Dar
'been- compellf^rto
be Â¦ witrii- literary productions "of,
the' second class and with devefcplng to
the highest degree the mechanical or in
dustrial arts. The fact is, however, that
ioare living on Europe for the best there
is in poetry, art, literature and science,
and the great danger Js :that ;we â¢ are apt
to-be content to go on living on ' Europe
and neglect to use our own . creative in
stinct^. Therein lies the greatest danger.'
The Chinese had the rudiments of science
centuries before Europe's greatest gen
iuses rose and gave them these rudiments.
The/ Chinese did not use their own cre
ative genius for higher development, and
therein lies the cause of their low stand
ard of civilization to-day."
"How, then, would you raise this stand
ard In America?" asked' the representa
tive of The Call.
; Where Lies the Remedy.
"Before any betterment can be expect
ed," replied President 'Schurman, , "we
must come to realize that we do occupy
an Inferior place in this sphere of culture.
"We must forget the fact that in many
things we lead the Old World, and this is
the hardest thing for us to do. When I
made this statement in my address an
alumnus of this university was so indig
nant that he said. to a friend who repeat
ed it to me that I had better go to Eu
rope and live there if I thought it so much
better than America. Realizing our posi
tion then, X would say that I believe that
the hope of the country is in its colleges
and universities. Education will- not pro-,
duco, genius, but it will /nurture and tend
to develop it. It is impossible to say how
many generations it would take to put
America in her proper position. It may
take fifty years or it x may take 500." 'WE have carefullx examined San Francisco harbor dur

hearts for their hosts of the day. .
The committee .embarked on the Slocum
at 10' o'clock. With them for the day's
trip were Congressmen"' Woods It and
Coombs, William M. Bunker and Major
Heuer. Assemblyman F. A. Cromwell/
John A. McNear and George P. McNear
were aboard as a committee from Peta
luma. â¢
The run down to ' Hunters Point was
fraught "with great Interest for the mem
bers of the committee. On the return trip
and the continuance of the excursion out
around Meiggs Wharf, past Blossom
Rock, Black Point, Fort Point. Mile Rock
and out close to Seal Rocks their interest
never lagged. . ' \
The Slocum swung to starboard outside
the Heads and ran in as close to : Seal
Rocks as safety would' permit and then
circled around In the opposite 'Â¦ direction
The following "committee of Petaluma
citizens was on the Gold to escort the
Congressmen up to the creek of the town:
Mayor H. CltyTrustees W. H.
Veale, M. Walsh, Alex Anderson and Jacob
Nisson: President of 'the Board of Trade
George P. McNear, V. A. Cromwell, John A.
McNear, â¢ Colonel Â¦ D. , B. Fairbanks, ' E. E.
Drees, J. L. Dlnwiddie. William Hill, MV. B.
Haskell, Captain N. Gould. ,F. M. Cplllns.
The steamer Gold was In Â¦waiting 1 with
a committee froni Petaluma' aboard.' The
Slocum could not . approach the landing,,
so the Gold steamed alongside and the
two vessels were made fast to each other
while the Slocum's passengers were trans
ferred, to 'th&.rlver steamer. / Â¦ . '
and came back under the lee of Point Bo
nita. Once back in the bay, the tug
steamed by the most direct route to Mc-
Nears Landing or Point Pedro.
THE water front of San Fran
cisco was inspected by the Riv
ers and Harbors Committee yes
terday from aboard the Slocum
as that stately craft steamed
along from the transport wharf
to Hunters Point and back again
and out to the heads. The Congressmen
saw dock- after dock crowded with ship
ping. Great steamships and huge sailing
vessels from tne four corners of the earth
lay at the wharves discharging valuable
cargoes, while others swung at anchor in
the stream, waiting for room to be made
for them to dock.
In ' many respects this trip along- the
docks was the most important to Cali
fornia's commercial interests of all that
the committee has made. In the main
prior trips have been over courses where
magnificent possibilities were more in evi
dence than present achievements. But
yesterday the visiting legislators saw ma
terial evidence that Is the best prophecy
of what the future has in store for this
port. v
The Congressmen were keenly alert and
frequently gave expression to astonish
ment. -
Chairman Burton was most deeply im
pressed with the possibilities of the ex
pansion of San Francisco's shipping facil
ities by the extension of the seawall
southward and the building of new docks.
He said that apparently no -serious ob
stacles to such expansion existed between
the present southerly end of the seawall
and Hunters Point, and he grew enthusi
astic in contemplation of the time when
ships would be at dock in continuous line
from Melggs wharf to Hunters Point, bus
ily discharging and loading cargoes, in
pursuit of the carrying trade of the Ori
ent.
Congressman Walter Reeves, who, by
the way, missed the Republican nomina
tion for Governor of Illinois at the last
State convention only by a narrow, mar
eln and who ranks high among the ablest
men of the House of Representatives,
was particularly impressed with the mag
nitude of the port's present shipping. He
paid that any one familiar with ocean
commerce would say that San Francisco
had a population of a million if he should
form his opinion from a view of the water
front alone.
UFE BREATHED
INTO DEAD FACTS
The visit of the Rivers and Harbors
Committee has proved of prime impor
tance to San Francisco and the State.
The members of the committee were as
Â¦well informed as to conditions and needs
of local shipping interests as men could
be rfrom the study of maps and chart?,
memorials and addresses. They have
come to San Francisco and have seen the
bay and its tributaries. . Life has been
breathed Into dead facts. The Congress
men of the committee know the grand
stretch of the harbor and the importance
of the port of San Francisco as they could
learn to knew it by no other -means.
The industry of the committee and Its
conscientious attention to the business of
t-he trip will be to a large degree responsi
ble for whatever benefits may accrue to
this region. The committee has not made
a junketing trip. â¢ The members â¢ have
Â¦worked with an earnestness rarely dis
played by a Congressional committee,
Every day has been devoted to serious
business, and a rich fund of information,
â¢will be taken back. to Washington to aid
In wise and helpful legislation for river
and harbor Improvements.

The trip along the water front yesterday

Flags were at half-mast and the bells
on the flrehouse tolled as the procession
moved slowly down Shattuck avenue,
which was lined with quiet crowds of

doors, and found that, they were all
locked but the front one. After a while
Adams showed himself at the front door,
and said he was ready to surrender. The
Marshal took Adams upstairs, where the
blood that was streaming 1 down his face
was washed off. Adams admitted that he
had shot Dr. Jessup.
" 'For God's sake keep out' or I'll kill you;
don't come upstairs,* I'm dangerous;' 'For
Gcd's sake keep out,' were the words
Adams told me he used when he warned

Kerns. "He said he would not have shot
Dr. Jessup if he had not been such a poor

him.'' "*:- ' t;; -;._Â¦'

attended Dr. Jessup after he was shot and
had performed the autopsy. He said the
patient was unconscious up to an hour be
fore his death at 11:30 o'clock on Tuesday

"Dr. Jessup said, while he was lying
there, that he ought to have killed him.
but afterward he thought better of it and
said It would not have been right to have
killed him,"- Armstrong continued. "He
said he'd gone there to protect the girl
from her father."
The noise and screaming of the women
attracted John Armstrong to the scene of
the shooting. He is a carpenter and lives
in the neighborhood of the Adams home.
Armstrong testified that he went to the
Adams house and found Dr. Jessup^ lying
on the porch, resting on his elbow. .The
pistol that did the deadly! work was lying

VERDICT OF JURY IN
CORONER'S COURT
"We, the jury, do find that
the name of the deceased 'was
John G. Jessup, a native of
"Wisconsin, aged 55 years, that
he came to his death at 2101
Hearst avenue, Berkeley, Ala
meda County, Cal., at about
11:15 p. m., June 18, 1901,
and that death was caused by
a gunshot wound in the chest
by one Charles G. Adams, aft
er having been repeatedly
xcrarned by said Adams not to
enter the premises."
BERKELEY, June 21.â The fore
going verdict, rendered . this
morning by the Coroner's Jury
at the inquest into the death
of Dr. John G. Jessup, amounts
to a practical exoneration of
Charles G. Adams, the un
frocked Episcopalian cleric who killed the
dentist in a fit of drunkenness. The
Jurors who gave the decision were:
George Moenning, Albert Selig, J. Ren
ning, E. C. Marliave, W. H. Driggs, D. F.
J^ungck, W. P. Grant and Fred Nugent.
Their verdict vas based upon the testi
mony of Miss Agnes S. Adams, daughter
of the accused cx-preacher. who testified
at the inquest, despite the declarations of
Dr. H. N. Rowell, her physician, who last
evening announced that her condition was
such that she could not be present. After
ecme official persuasion to-day on the part
of Coroner Mehrmann, the medical man
Â¦withdrew his opposition and Miss Adams
â¢was escorted to the morgue, assisted by
her uncle, W. J. Adams.
Miss Adams at the Inquest.
The young 1 woman was the central fig-
Tire at the inquiry. Frail and slender,
with her features closely veiled, she pre
sented a pitiable picture, as she sat at the
Coroner's side, telling the story of her
father's frenzied act that cost the life of
her protector. ..,
It was manifest that the young woman
had suffered keenly. She could speak
fcarely above a whisper and the jurors
â¢were compelled to crowd closely about the
girl to catch her faintly uttered words.
Withal, it -was a clear, recital of the
circumstances and left a strong impres
sion upon the listening jurors and specta
tors.
She spoke as If she fully realized the
Import of her words. On one hand was
the man ready for the last rites who had
gene at her behest to the residence she
feared to approach alone. On the other
side was the father, waiting with nervous
impatience In a prison cell the decision of
the jury that should have so much bear
ing upon his case in the future.
Adams Was ITot Present.
Adams was net present at the inquest.
His attorneys. N. A. McConaghy and X..
E. Church, decided not to have him there,
taking advantage of the legal rights
which protected their client.
The verdict pleased the lawyers and it
Â¦was welcome news to Adams, Â¦who learned
what the jury had done with evident grat
ification.
"It will go' -a long way toward my
acnuittal." he commented.
"When Coror.er Mehrmann began the in
quest this morn'ng he heard a number of
preliminary witnesses, nnd then, to the.
surprise of the attendants. Miss Adams

NEW YORK, June 21.â Superintendent
Hanklnson of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty 11 to Animals said . to-day
that fully 10,000 horses 'in New York were
suffering from a new and peculiar disease
which resembles the grip. The disease is
spreading rapidly; It attacks every sort
and condition of horse, from \ the high
steppers in Central Park to the slow-going
truckhorse in West street. '_'-'.
- The disease first made its appearance
| last Saturday, which was- unusually cold
for this time of year, and Is ascribed to
the change in the weather.^ The tempera
ture goes up to 105 degrees, the throat be
comes sore, a bad cough appears and loss

Superintendent Hankinson says that the
disease is not like the epidemic of epi
zootic which struck this country- Â¦Â¦ In "the
'70s, but' is a kind of laryngeal influenza.
He warns owners and drivers of horses
that If the animals exhibit "these; symp

The board is considering a proposal for
nineteen-knot battleships, . and as the in
creased weight for machinery is to be met
by an increase of it . is ' pos
sible that the board will be able to agree
on this speed. The members of the board
are anxious that each vessel shall have
a steaming radius of from 7000 to 10,000
miles, and large coal carrying capacity, is
consequently Imperative. It is expected
that several months will be occupied In
the discussion of designs. . . The plans of
projected armored cruisers Â¦ will? not be
taken up until the characteristics of the
battleships are . practically determined.
Secretary Long. has directed that repairs
be made to the battleship Oregon without
that vessel being placed out of commis
sion. Her retention "in commission "is
necessary because there are no : facilities
for taking care of the ship at Bremerton,
Washington, where ~ she ; is ; to . bo - over
hauled.
â¢ Â¦ Â¦â¢ .
It is evident that the proposed battle
ships will have higher speed than any
hitherto authorized, though some weeks
ago when the board gave preliminary con
sideration to the matter it was suggested
that eighteen knots were sufficient, pro
vided there should be no loss of effective
ness In any other department of the ship.
The others represent batteries of twelve
and eight Inch guns, the latter being dis
tributed behind casemates along the sides
of the ships, twelve and seven inch guns
and twelve and six inch guns. The super
imposed turrets, of course, provide for
twelve and eight inch guns, with seven
and six inch guns in casemate. *

THE first annual singles, tournament for the championship of the State will commence at" San Rafael on the 2d
of July and be completed on the 4th, when the final match only will be played." This tournament will be" "< unde'r
the auspices of the Pacific States Lawn Tennis Association and will be directly in charge of the committee ap
pointed by the association. This committee Is composed. of W.-B. Colller'Jr., R. N. Whitney and Dr.; F. J. Lane/
.George W. Lane will act as referee. All the cracks are hard at" work practicing and will be in. the best of form
by. the first of the month. 'â¢ Those who put in the most, time on. the courts and who will, surely enter are: vGeorge
F. -Whitney, R. N. Whitney. Sumner Hardy, W. B. . Collier, Merle Johnson. Ray: Cornell; : Harold Crowell, Fred
Brown, Drummond McGavin, Chet. Smith, Dr. Lane, Sidney Salisbury, James A. Code, George Lane and Grant Smith.
Champion George Whitney is naturally looked- upon as the one having, the best' chance of .taking first place, but" the
presence of his brother and Sumner Hardy in the tournament makes his victory, uncertain. .
George Whitney is. easily 'the best player In the Pacific States, having won. the championship" of the coast three times."
The ease with which he won in the last two years shows beyqnd>'a -doubt that he is superior to any one on the coast in
tennis. R. N. Whitney, who, with- his brother. George, . holds the championship of the coast in doubles.is capable of play-
Ing brilliant tennis attimes, but his .tournament game is considerably behind his practice play. If he should happen to be "
right on edge during the course of the tournament he would stand a very good : chance of emerging a winner. "
:: Sumner Hardy, ex-champion of the coast In both singles and doubles, a few years ago occupied the position In the tennis
world now held. by George Whitney.. These two experts will undoubtedly come together in the coming, tourney and a very
Interesting match wljl be the result. ; ;: -. v - ~ : . ' .. , v .' > Â¦
,W._B.\ Collier, who Is another old-timer at the game,- made a very good showin'g last year, ; when he was runner-up in '
the singles championship tournament.- He hasbeen too long at" the game to be considered a promising man, but he Is one
of the best players in the second-class. Steadiness combined with grit and determination is ~, the feature of /Collier's game '".Â¦
Drummond McGavin is a very promising young player, his main fault being laek of ambition. When in the mood Mc-
Gavln, who. like his father, has very graceful strokes, can put up a beautiful article of tennis. In the intercollegiate tour

class to the second and is already well up In that. Johnson has the most peculiar style, of. any. player on the local courts"
and some of his strokes are v unsolvable. One. of his strokes in "particular, known as the rabbit stroke, is entirely original '
and very hard to copy.-. ; _ ' .-. ;.;Â¦ -, . Â¦ : -. ;..-' Â¦.
': Grant Smith.. another man with- but little experience, is also a f very promising player. His service 'and' 1 net 'work are
very strong and his great height is a' big advantage. at the net; -The .weakest part of his game Is his back-court work
which, however, Is rapidly improving., Smith plays a very accurate game at the net and puts lots of speed Into his strokes'-
Ray Cornell, who progressed rather slowly, for a long time, is Rapidly coming to the front arid gives promise of becom
ing a first class man. *He plays a defensive .game,, which, however, combined with, steadiness, .is a. very hard one to beat.*
Cornell's best stroke is" his lob. 'which is a ; very effective' one, as few men are good smashers. ' . â¢ Â¦
Of the younger players Chet.. Smith is 'probably., the' mbat promising. Smith hasan excellent style. : but'is very erratic-

YACHTS OFF
FOR VALLEJO
Â¦ This evening the fleets of the San Fran
cisco,; Corinthian and '. California Tacht
clubs will rendezvous 'at Vallejo, where
the California yachts Tnelma and Occi
dent are due on their return from the trip
up the' Sacramento River, on which they
started a week ago. .
The selection of to-day for a cruise to
Vallejo does not seem a good one, a3 it
Is high water at 4:50 this afternoon and
low, water at 10:29 to-morrow morning. It
is not unlikely tjjat some of the boats will
not get j further than McNears Landing
to-night, and will there await the coming
of the fleet from Vallejo.
Secretary W. M. Edgell and W. G. Mor
row will" take their first sail In the yawl
Royal to-day, going down first to San
Mateo, whence they, will tow a. small boat
belonging to G. P. Tallant, who joined
the club last month. : Leaving the boat
at Sausalito, they will sail up the. bay,
hoping to make "Vallejo. Â¦
It Is understood that the Vallejo Yacht
Club had no intention of challenging for
the Perpetual cup until an. ex-commodore
of the San Franclscos suggested the Idea
to Commodore A. E. v Chapman, who was
building a new yacht at Matthew Tur
ner's yard at Benlcia. As. Chapman was
doing the work on her himself, she would
not- have been finished in time to chal
lenge-for the trophy, 'but the money to
employ ship carpenters being offered by
; the ex-commodore, the work will be com
pleted quickly. The Vallejo Club was so
little informed as to the regular manner
of procedure that its secretary sent the
challenge to Orlo Eastwood, secretary of
the Pacific Interclub Tacht Association
who sent.it back.. Since then the chal
lenge has been sent in due form to Sec
retary. Brlckell of the Corinthian Yacht
Club. As the Vallejo Yacht Club, having
sent in a challenge, did not wish to with
draw it. the San Franclscos .will not be
gin work on the construction of their rac
ing craft for the present. Â¦
,Scme .changes in the club fleets have
taken place lately. â¢ E. Bowes of the sloop
Genesta has bought the sloop Ceres from
D. S. Watson., and will either sell her
again or charter her. The schooner Wave
owned by, W. L. Oliver,- has been taken
from, Tlburon Cove to Sausalito and will
be sailed by. George Â¦ Story. The little
sloop Dewey, lying ofT Sausalito. will be
sailed by H. ' H. Jenness, formerly secre
tary of the San Francisco Yacht Club
who is living at the Gables, Sausalito
.The schooner Outing haa been on Smith's
ways at Sausalito receiving a coat of cop
per paint, but has been taken back to her
moorings at Greenbrae.
Some of the yachtsmen will try to make
long trips -on Independence day, "the onlv
scheduled event being the annual race o'f
the Californias for the Wallace trophy
This is held by E. F. Sagar's sloop Edna
which, though owned by the vice commo
dore of the. Corinthian Yacht Club has
remained for several years â¢ on the roll of
the Californias. The "Wallace troohy was
won in the first race in 1896 by Edna, in
the. second race in that year and In 1SS7
by the late: A. E.' von Schmidt's^ cutter
Whirlwind; -in 1S98.11899 and 1900 by the
Edna, It was presented in 1896 by W C
Wallace and; established as a perpetual
challenge trophy on February. 25 of that
year. It Is thought that John T. Carrier's
sloop j Jessie E will; make a good cont-vs*
for the trophy this year. .
County was played June 13 at the lower
end 'of Clear LÂ»ke between the Lakeport
and Burns Valley teams, the Lakeport
men winning with ar score of 185 to 94 rnnQ

REGATTA FOR
THE OARSMEN
The arrangements for the Fourth of
July regatta on Lake Merritt are pro
gressing, and the event bids fair to eclipse
any that the rowing men of San Fran
cisco Bay have had for many years. Last
Tuesday night the executive committee
of the Fourth of July celebration . com
mittee of Oakland officially appropriated
$900 for the entertainment to be given in
the afternoon cf Independence day, no
less than 5S00 of which will go to the
oarsmen and swimmers, $100 being de
voted to the so-called "literary pro
gramme." The participants in the rowing
and swimming events will receive prizes
really worth contending for, Instead of
the meager trophies which the, Pacific
Association has been able- to offer at re
cent championship regattas. The oars
men are naturally manifesting much en
thusiasm, and all the rowing .clubs,
except the Pioneers and Tritons, will
enter barge crews.
The Pioneers are somewhat disorgan
ized by the fact that they have lost .their
old boathouse on Long Wharf, and : have
no training quarters. .Their only repre
sentative -will probably" be in the out
rigged skiff junior race. The Tritons
have very rarely entered contestants in
any .of the regattas,^ and the only man
who has represented them in recent years
Is Stanley Adderley, now of the Dolphin
Boating Club's junior barge crew.' .
The South End Rowing Club will be
to the fore again, the official declaration
by the Pacific Association of Robert Me-
Arthur's amateur status having rendered
it possible to get together again the
famous "Midget" crew, which went out
on Tuesday night for its first practice
row. The crew is made up of Henry
Bode, bow; "Gus". Carson, No. 2; Robert
McArthur. No. 3, and Frank Duplissea,
stroke. The. Scuth Ends also have inter
mediate and Junior barge crews In train
ing, the intermediate four being J. Pallas,
bow; .M. J. Bieen, No. 2; A. McDuffle,
No/ 3, and Ed. Scully, stroke. The junior
baree crew consists of Frank Mayo, bowi
F. Pallas; No. 2; J. P. Foley. No. 3,. and
Charles Jenkins, stroke.
Dr. C. C. Dennis has retired from the
junior four In order to enter the seni<w
outrigged skiff race, which- is the second
event on the programme, M. - Cashman
will represent the South Â¦ Ends in the
Junior outrigged skiff event, and George
McGriU in the senior shell race.
W. B. HInchman, president of the Pa
cific Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union, and secretary of the Fourth of
July regatta committeej left last night for
a trip to the Eastern States. The next
meeting of the regatta committee will be
held on the evening of Friday. -June 28. or
three days before the last day which en
tries will be receivedâ July. 1. The times
made In the various events on Lake Mer
ritt will be accepted as official records on
still water. . Hitherto the courses at Long
Wharf and BI Campo have, been of so
indefinite and uncertain a length that
times were of no value at all. On Lake
Merritt, however, it will easy to mark
off the exact distances. Arrangements
are being made to ensure plenty of water
In the lake on regatta day. "
The Ariel Rowing Club will have repre
sentatives in almost all the events except
the two outrigged skiff races, the skiffs
owned by the club being of too old and
heavv a type to make It worth while pit
ting them against the new racing craft
of the Alameda and Dolphin clubs. The
Ariel junior barge crew will also enter
the Intermediate race; it . consists of J.
Koakes, bow; Harry Foleyl Â¦ No. 2; W.
Smith, No. 3,- and J. . Keegan, . stroke.
This Is the crew that rowed in the cham
pionship regatta last year, except that
H. Luhrson has retired, and J. . Noakes
has been added. . The Ariels are training
from the South End boathouse, -around
which there are signs of great activity
nowadays.' .'". ' . --
The oarsmen of the University of Cali
fornia are enjoying a vacation -and are
going out regularly every morning for
practice on Oakland Creek. The Ariel
Rowing Club has lent them a barge, as
the one owned by the University Club
does not conform to the requirements of
the Pacific Association, being .single
streak and outrigged. â¢ The Ariel Rowing
Club has received notice , to Â¦ leave , Its
quarters, but has not yet done/so.
The Triton Swimming and Boating Club
recently held . an .' election, at . â¢which' the
following officers were chosen:' President;
D.-H. Everett; financial secretary, H. C.
Cook; recording secretary, A. S. Garvle;
treasurer. D. H. O'Keefe; captain, H.
Brett; lieutenant, â¢ H. K. . Burgess:
trustees. W. S. White, W. F. Word and
C. Artigues. Last Sunday the. members
were entertained on J. Hellbron's ark at
Greenbrae, to which they rowed from the
city. The boathouse .will soon be moved
from its present site, which has become
obstructed with sand,, to a new location
at the foot of Larkin street.'
TENNIS EXPERTS ARE FAITHFULLY TRAINING
FOR THE COMING CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNEY
JACK ROOT
AND CARTER
ARE READY
Well-Known Boxers
Prepared to Put Up
a Fast Battle.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
"Kid" Carter, the Brooklyn boxer, who is
said to be the most perfectly formed mail
now battling before the public, will have
an opportunity on Tuesday evening next
to prove to the ring goers of this city and
vicinity whether he Is entitled to fame
as a pugilist. He must face Jack
Root, one of the coolest ring generals and
Btiffest punchers In the ring to-day, and if
he wins Carter will have the right to de
clare himself the best 160-pound man in ,
the world.
Root and Carter are scheduled^, to box
twenty rounds before the Twentieth Cen
tury Club In Mechanics' Pavilion on June
28. Carter has trained at Blanken's Six
Mile House and Root has prepared at
Croll's Gardens, Alameda. That both men
Â¦will be in superb condition when they
enter the roped arena on the night of the
contest Is assured by the importance of
the contest. It is practically a champion
ship battle. Root stands head and shoul
ders above any man of his weight and as
he Is comparatively young is ambitious to
win further fame and shekels with his
doughty fists. Carter on the other hand
Is but 20 years of age and In appearance
reminds one of an overgrown youth. Car
ter has been boxing since the age of 15,
and during his ring career has met and
beaten some of the leaders in his class.
He is entitled to a bout with Root, and
the question is, will he make good? Ring
goers ljope he will, as they want to see
Root extend himself. Jack has fought
twice before local fight audiences, but in
both Instances his game was comparative
ly easy. Alec Greggains put up a game
battle, but he was not the same Alec that
beat Costello and other old time cham
pionship aspirants. In his second bout
Root contended with. George Byers, a
colored man who has outclassed some
heavy punchers, but when pitted against
Root was like the veriest babe in his
hands.
Tim Hegarty Is not clever, but he Is a
puncher. Bvery person who visits the
Australian's training Quarters comes away
with this belief. The question arise?, will
he be able to land on shifty Tim Calla
han? If he does, there is even' likelihood
that the Philadelphia pugilist will go
home a beaten man and McGovern will
have an opponent worthy of his prowess
Hegarty Is a bundle of wiry muscles. His
shoulders are as broad as Al Kelll's and
he is the biggest little man that ever
fought under 126 pounds.
Callahan Is conceded to' be plucky, a
stiff puncher and one of the cleverest
featherweights in the ring. That he will
give Hegarty a run for his money is as
sured.
â¢ â¢ â¢
George Gardner, who is to box Jack
Moffatt before the San Francisco Athletic
Club on the afternoon of July 4, is even
more superstitious than his opponent
Moffatt has a penchant for fire engines
and Gardner believes Jn horse shoes. The
latter's training quarters .at the Ingle
side House has taken on the appearance
of a blacksmith shop. Gardner in the
daily course of training trips merrily over
the road, and Â¦whenever he spies a horse
shnp y~c picks it up as* an omen of good
luck. As he does not overlook a shoe In
the course of his travels he generally bur
dens himself with many pounds of old
iron. After his fight with Moffatt he In
tends disposing of the lot to some junk
dealer.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Willie Snallham. the husky bantam
champion of the coast, will enter the pro
fessional ranks on July 4. Snallham has
bo^ten every bÂ»y of his weight and inches
and is now unable to secure a match. It
5s the intention of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club to match clever Willie Schoen
bein against Snallham as a preliminary
bout to the two big fights to be brought
off on the national holiday. It is to be re
gretted that clever Frankie Nelll does not
â¢weigh' five pounds more, as he and Snall
ham would put urÂ» a merry bout.
CLASS DOGS
WILL RACE
The match race between Harlean Gladys
and Sacramento Boy has been declared
off. at least for a time. Considerable in
terest has been .manifested in the match
by the followers of- coursing ever since
the publication of the challenge from the
owner of Harlean Gladys. When the defl
â¢w-as issuei Sacramento Boy was getting:
In shape, having been on the retired list
for some time on account of a broken
toe nail. His owners, however, were not
averse to a little easy money and started
to get the winner of the last John Grace
cup ready for the match. After the sec
ond day's work the Boy was again put
on the shelf, the*same toe nail throwing
the dog out of training. In his present
condition it would be useless to try to
prepare the dog for a special match. It
will take all his trainer's spare time get
ting the great courser fit for the next
John Grace cup stake. '.Sr *Â¦Â¦
In Rural Artist the Pasha kennels have
Indeed a strange coursing freak. When
Mr. Rossiter returned from England lie
brought Artist with him and' It was
thought that the courser would go rapid
ly to the front as a money winner. Prom
the start the newcomer showed his breed-
Ing and in his trials developed consider
able sDeed. When it came to going the
distance, however, the Artist was not
there, and at best four courses figured as
his limit. The cause of his weakening Is
easily seen when it is shown beyond
doubt that between courses the fast and
â¢willing hound loses weight sometimes to
the extent of two to four pounds. Lately
the dog has fhown that he is possessed
of a great drive, which, with his speed
should brirg him near the finish in his
stakes. If a remedv can be found for his
. extraordinary weight-losing.

Prizes to Be Offered.
At a.meeting'of the 'regatta committee
held last night It was formally announced
that the , Oakland Fourth; of July celebra
tion committee has appropriated the sum
of $670 for the oarsmen*^$100 for the swim
mers and, $30 for the transportation of
boats to and from "Lake Merritt. It was
decided to give first prizes of $100- and
second prizes of $50 in each barge race; to
offer first prizes of $35 and second prizes
of $20 in each shell apd skill race, one
prize being given in events where there
are two starters and two prizes in racesÂ»
with more than j two - starters. There
will be swimming races of . 100 and 440
yards, a Yelay ; swimming race and a
water polo game, the sum of $115- being
awarded in prize3 in the swimming
events. The officials of the regatta will
be selected at the meeting to be held
next Â¦ Friday evening, _ June 28. C. H
Smith, president of the Alameda Boating
Club, was appointed secretary in the,
place of . W. B. Hinchman, who left for
the East last night. C..H. Smith will ask
the advice of Al Rogers, the boat builder,
as to the best means of transporting tbe
barges apd skiffs from this city to Lake
Merritt. Tents will be provided for the
use of contestants. The delegates were
reouested to have the entries from their
elu"bs ready next Friday, though the entry
list does not close officially till Monday,
July 1, at 8 p. m., at the Olympic Club, t
fornia also will take part in the regatta
on July 4 on Lake Merritt. . Hitherto the
oarsmen. of the university have had few
opportunities of- measuring themselves
against -â¢ the " representatives of. the -bay
rowing clubs, jis the rowing regattas gen
erally are held on Sunday, and 'the au
thorities of the university do not look
favorably upon racing on that' day. "The
university : crew consists of \Vaddeleigh,
bow; Harley, No. 2; Muller, No. 3; Cerf,
stroke, and Boyle, cockswain. Cerf is the
most experienced of the four, as : he won
the outrlgged skiff championship of the
'university in November of last year. .The
university boathouse/- is on Sessions
Basin, East Oakland, and the students
have the advantage of practice on the
smooth water of Oakland Creek; for, this
being vacation time, they are able to go
out every morning before the wind gets
up. Until a few days ago they used an
outrigged four-oar, built without â¢ laps,
but, as this boat could not be classed as a
"barge," which is lap-streak and has no
outriggers, they are now using a barge
loaned to them by the Ariel Rowing Club.
The crew has also had the advantage of
being coached by W. B. Goodwin of Yale.
The stroke, owing to his comparatively
short stature, tends rather to hurry his
men, who do not reach out and lack body
swing. However, if they can hit up a
rapid stroke and establish a lead, they
will be formidable opponents in the junior
barge race, especially as they have, their
whole- time to devote to practice, what
ever the result of the race may be. it is
a satisfactory thing to have a crew from
Krug and Nordyke do not don their war

The game was full of Interest and vic

when the Dudes swooped down on Evans'
curves and planted four singles In us
many minutes.
It was an ideal day for a baseball game
arid the attendance was pood for a week
dav. The Dudes went tirst to bat, but
dm nothing startling. The German band
also made their little bow and then went
out to play. Neither team could score
unti] the sixth, although each had men
on the sacks and in several instances half
way home. Oakland broke the spell "in
that inning. Drennan rapped out the
long-est hit of the game, the ball gtÂ»ingr
over Hildey's head, but Mr. Drennan
could only take two cushions. StreSb fol
lowed with a neat single and Drennan
raced home with the first run of the
game. Streib stole second and eventually
reached third, but expired - there, as the
next two were ea,sy outs. Kagan in the
seventh gave way to Doctor Moskiman,
who covered the first bag in his usual
clever fashion. Nothing startling hap
pened until the last half of the ninth,
when, with two men out, Graham tied
the score with a pretty hit over second.
There was tumultuous applause as Xor
dyke galloped home from second.
JCrug opened this inning with a sharp
hit to third, which was cleverly fielded by
Moore, who threw to Moskiman. Umpire
Tyler called it out, but the home rooters
thought differently. Nordyke banged the
Sball and Moore made a sensational stop,
spoiling a two-base hit. Josh Â¦went out.
and then Graham staved off defeat by hLs

gued against the use of asbestos," claiming
that an asphalt roof was perfectly safe.

To-morrow morning two teams com
posed of employes of the Southern Pacific
Company will try the national game at
Recreation' Park. It will be the uptown
offices against the clerks at Fourth and
Townsend streets.
Roy Evans seems to play in hard luck'.
Every time he twirls a few more innings
are tacked on. It may seem odd, but his
team mates are weak at bat. when he is
on the slab. Twice last week Roy had
to bat in the winning runs. He has often
worked against Hodson in the East and
generally came out on top. Yesterday
Mr.. Hodson reversed the order of things.
The locals still have a slight lead in the
league race. All the teams are bunched
and the race grows more exciting as the
season progresses?
Graham's over-anxiety to nail a man
stealing second has led him to drop or
fumble the ball. Twice In yesterday's
game he made these breaks.
Pabst failed his team at a critical mo
ment yesterday. For the first time in
many games he failed to drive out a hit
when it was needed.
When the Dutch went to the Southland
last week they were half a game ahead of
the Legislators. Strange to relate they
lost three out of four and yet returned
home with a bigger lead,, as Sacramento
dropped four with Oakland. Such are the
fortunes of baseball.
"Ham" Iburg will be In the points for
the Dutch to-day and "Doc" Moskiman
will officiate in a like capacity for the
Beans. "Ham's" ankle is on the improve
but he is stepping In high places.
It seems to be the style for circus
catches in center field. Drennan pulled
one down a few days ago,- and Mr. Croll of
Alameda followed suit in yesterday's
trouble.
"Steamboat" Croll was caught napping
on bases twice during yesterday's game.
He escaped once.
Oakland's "dummy" fund is increasing.
Moore will' be asked to. contribute twice
for misplays -and Dunleavy once for indif
ferent fielding in Thursday's game. This
fund will be divided among the players
who were not assessed during the season.
A foot race between Jones of Los An
geles and Babbitt of Oakland would be
an interesting feature of a game. Both
are lightning fast on bases and ought to
do the hundred in :10 3-5 seconds..
Cal Ewing intends taking a month's va
cation in the wilds of -Trinity County. He
will leave on July 1. During his absence
Petey Lohman will scold the team. .
Evans seems the only pitcher on the
German nine who can hit. He Uses a
sawed-off bat and the opposing twirlers
use an outshoot to advantage, as he must
reach for the ball half the time.
Held is still a sick man and will be sent
to his home in Los Angeles to recuperate.
When he again goes into the game he
will guard the initial sack for the Dudes,
and "Truck" will exercise his wing-in

IN GREAT FORM
NO four-oared barge crew that has
ever rowed on' the bay of San
Francisco is better known or
has acheived a higher reputa
tion than the "Midgets" of the
South End Rowing Club. This crew,
consisting of Henry Bode, s bow; Robert
McArthur, No. 2; "Gus"- Carson,: No. 3;
Frank Duplissea, stroke, and George Mc-
GriU, cockswain, won the senior -barge
race at the El Campo regatta on. June 20,
1897, and the senior barge championship
at the regatta on September 19 of the
same year. On this occasion the""mld
gets" "defeated decisively their old op
ponents, the "Giants" of the Stockton
Athletic Association.
For the last three seasons, however, the
"Midget" - crew has not been heard of,
the disqualification . of Robert McArthur
as an amateur having deprived the South
End Rowing Club of his services as an
oarsman and coach. At a meeting of the
Pacific Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, held a few evenings ago. it
was decided that, as McArthur has
abstained for more than two years from
taking any interest or part in professional
sport, he will be readmitted to amateur
standing. The old "Midget" four has ac
cordingly been reorganized, with Mc-
Arthur at No. 3, and Carson on No. 2's
thwart, and will take part in the senior
barge championship race on Lake Merrltt
on Independence day.

HANDBALL IS
VERY POPULAR
The indications are that fully 50.000 peo
ple will see the race. Mayor Harrison and
Chief of Police O'Neill have both decided
there shall be no open betting. It is be
lieved the New York system of -betting
will be' followed.
Local opinion is widely divided. In fact,
there never was such a diversity of opin
ion and it is pronounced on "all sides a
very open race. His Eminence and Bonni
bert, however, have the biggest follow
ing, with the Schorr stable and Terminus
next. Lady Schorr to-day seemed to have
grown quite out of "her lameness of yes
terday.
The Parader arrived from the East late
this afternoon. He made the trip most
successfully, looking good and fresh after
his leng journey. As a result the opinions
of the betting men have shifted toward
him as the most probable winner. It has
been believed the effort to send him out
here only the day before the race was a
mistaken i>olicy, but he looked so well
when he was led from the car at Wash
ington Park this evening that everybody
who saw him was impressed by his good
appearance.
T. P. Hayes, who Is at present In litiga
tion with the Western JocKey Club,- Is the
owner of Lady Strathmore, and he has
not announced who will ride her. She Is
regarded as a doubtful starter and It is
thought Royal Victor may be sent to the
post in her stead. Jimjnez is also re
garded as a doubtful starter, inasmuch
as he has been beaten time and again on
the local tracks . this spring by cheap
horses.

The recent meeting of the Y. M. C. A. in Boston
has resulted in a discussion of the' propriety, of ex
hibiting copies of the nude statues of ancient Greek
art in a public place; and Boston has become so
much absorbed in it as to have lost interest in- the
Philippines, the negrces of the South and the base
ball games. Fortunately there is no danger of the
controversy spreading any farther west than Chicago.
FREDERIC HARRISON, who has just returned
to London after avisit to the United States, has
contributed to the Nineteenth Century an ac
count of his impressions of American life which are
in the highest degree complimentary. They are, in
fact, a little bit too eulogistic, and the pleasure given
by the praise is marred by the fact that the commen
dation is so indiscriminate, that we can hardly accept
him as an altogether trustworthy critic.
He begins by expressing admiration at the thor
oughness with which we have absorbed all immigrants
of different races and developed one people over the
whole wide extent of the republic. Between one sec
tion of the Union and another he says there are no
such differences as exist among the English, Irish,
Scotch* and Welsh of the British kingdom. "From
Long Island to San Francisco, from Florida Bayto
Vancouver Island, there is one dominant race and
civilization, one -language, one type of law, one sense
of nationality. That race, that nationality, is Ameri
can to the core. And the consciousness of its vast
expansion and collective force fills the. mind of
American citizens as nothing can do to this degree in
the nations of Western Europe. Vast expansion, col
lective force, inexhaustible energyâ these -are the im
pressions forced on the visitor, beyond all that he
could have conceived or. had expected to find."
Passing to a consideration of the vital forces which
animate the people he points out that within a very
few. years 'the United States must hold the foremost
place in the world without dispute, that our natural
resources exceed those of all Europe put together,
and that our social and political system is more fa
vorable to material development than any other.so
ciety ever devised by man. The ingrained sense of
equality reacts upon all citizens and all things. Of
the officials at Washington he says: "It is true that
Congressmen have not that repose of manner which
marks the caste of Vere de Vere; but the men who
are charged to speak in the name of the state 'will
be usually ' found to rise to the occasion with that
facility which enables every, genuine American to
adapt himself to play a new part and fulfill an uiiac-;
customed duty."
.All of that is excellent and true. We can accept it
with gratification as the observation of an acute mind
and feel pleased that it comes to us from a foreigner
of such eminence as Mr.- Harrison. '.We can hardly
fail, however, to perceive that he has; not been either
a close student of our conditions or a careful critic
of them .when he goes on' to say: "As to the worshio

As one of the features of the New Orleans expo
sition to commemorate the/ annexation of the Loui
siana country to the Union it is proposed to erect a
monument to Napoleon Bonaparte, who arranged for
the transfer. It is not easy to see why Napoleon is

and are willing to erect it for any old reason,,
OUR DISTINGUISHED VISITORS.
CALIFORNIA, andin an especial sense San
Francisco, owes much to the gentlemen of the
Rivers and Harbors Committee of the House
of Representatives, who have made the long journey
across the continent that they might determine by
personal investigation the nature and extent of the im
provements that are needed in such of our waterways
as are subject to Federal supervision.
In some respects such investigation was an act of
duty, and yet it is not one that is imposed by law. As
a matter of fact it could not be so imposed, for a sys
tematic study of all the rivers and harbors of the
country could not be undertaken by a Congressional
committee. That task is imposed upon Government
surveyors and engineers, who are especially charged
with -making such investigations and reports as Con
grress calls for. That which the committee has under
taken in tljis case, therefore, has been the performance
of a work over and above the obligations of their of
fice. It has been the outcome of a patriotic desire
to learn clearly the true conditions of our rivers and
harbors, to the end that' a better conception might
be had of the amount of appropriations California
may justly claim at the hands of Congress. .
The visit has been anything but a junket. From
the time they arrived in California the gentlemen of
the committee have been at work. They have' made
a personal inspection of every point in our rivers and
harbors along their route where improvements â¢ are
needed. They have given their time and their atten
tion to experts and other authorities upon every mat
ter under, investigation. Their study of San Fran
cisco Bay, for example, has extended from Alviso
Channel to Napa Creek, and has included Mare
Istend Channel and all important points in the harbor
and along the Oakland water front. The result is that
the committee will have fuller information and a
clearer understanding of the importance of San Fran
cisco Bay and of. the genuine needs of improvement
than any other Rivers and Harbors Committee that
has ever sat in Congress.
It is to be borne, in mind the studies of the visitors
are by no means confined to this section of the State.
The scope of their self-imposed task includes all Cali
fornia, and each section and Congressional district
is to have due attention when the committee sets
about digesting the results of the examinations and
determines the extent to which they can recommend
appropriations for improvements.
For this careful study of our interests thanks are
due to our guests. Their visit would have been pleas
ant and welcome had they come but to enjoy a holi
day in our matchless summer climate; but coming as
they did, not for enjoyment but to work, and, more
over, to work for our sake and our welfare, they are
entitled to the highest recognition our hospitality
and our gratitude can bestow. .
To make a tour of the big churches of
New York Is a common thing. To visit
the little, unknown sanctuaries ia not so
common, but it is Infinitely more Interest
ing. One feature of these unadvertlsed
services that is worth noticing Is the va
riety of collection boxes still In vogue.
In no place is the old brass warming
pan or the wire corn popper still passed
around, but those Colonial makeshifts
have given way to devices scarcely less
primitive. The silver plates seen in the
more prosperous churches are the excep
tions rather than the rule in these un
pretentious chapels. There the shallow
wicker baskets stand highest in favor aa
temporary banks.
Plain wooden boxes on four-foot poles
are also frequently seen. Some of these
boxes are unlined, while others, to deaden
the sound of the falling coin, have a lin
ing of cloth or velvet. Cloth and velvet
caps on sticks are used In several
churches, and in one tiny chaoel on tho
upper east side a plain, everyday derby
hat answerg the purpose. Saltation Army

Few perhaps among the tourists who
visit Norway for the pleasure of its scen

quarters of Europe's ice supply. To the
mountain lakes of that country the Con
tinent looks for its Ice. The ice is of the
finest quality, for the lakes are of crystal
clear water, high up in the mountains,
and are surrounded by very tall pines.
The ice supply Is controlled by syndicates.
After having been cut into great squares
by plows, the blocks of ice are sent
down the mountain side on slides. On the
way down they acauire amazing velocity
and plunge into an inclosed pool, beyond
which are . the " ice-ships awaiting their
frozen cargo. ,
It sometimes happens that, through de
lay in the starling of these vessels, or the
cutting of unusual quantities from the
lakes to supply exceptional demands, the
supply runs short. Then it is that ice be
comes dear, and even in winter time it is
a luxury that must be indulged in spar
ingly. But ice is used In Europe far less
commonly than In America, and a defi
cient supply does not occasion the sense
of loss that it would cause in this country.

WASHINGTON MEMORIAL.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the committee appointed last winter to
consider. the advisability of establishing a na
tional university at the capital have concluded that a
university of the kind is not advisable nor desirable,
and by way of a substitute propose the establishment
of a Washington Memorial Institute. The proposed
foundation is not to compete with universities, but
is to serve as a" medium through which all 'students
can have such facilities of study as the. national cap
ital and its great governmental departments afford. -
The establishment of a national university was one
of the desires of Washington, and in his will he left
a bequest for such an institution. For some time the
scheme was discussed by successive Presidents, but
nothing was ever. done. ""In those early days it was
felt that the country could not afford expense, and
the people were not aware of the immense benefits
which universities confer upon a nation: Then a time
came when the plan was. forgotten. When it was re
vived some years ago it was found that the country
had undergone a transformation. The objection
then made was not that the country is too poor or
that the people dp not appreciate the use of universi
ties, but' that so many institutions "of the, kind have
been established there is no longer need of one at
the national capital.
The advocates of the measure have, however, been
active and influential, and last winter Congress passed
an act providing: "That facilities for study and re
search in the Government departments, the library
of Congress, j the National Museum, , the Zoological
Park, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Fish Commission,
the Botanic Gardens and similar institutions hereafter
established shall be afforded to scientific investigators
and to duly qualified individuals, students and gradu
ates of institutions of learning in the several States
and Territories, as well as in the District of Colum
bia, under such rules and restrictions as the heads
of the departments and bureaus mentioned may pre
scribe."
With that much to go, upon it-is fairly certain that
had the committee in charge of the . movement re
ported in favor of a university Congress at the next
session, would have granted an appropriation and 'the
long desired university might at last 'have been es
tablished. The committee, however, has thought best
not; to promote a rival of the existing universities.
The .proposed Washington Memorial Institute is to
facilitate the use by students of the governmental re
sources at the capital, and is to co-operate with uni
versities in all parts of the country. It is of course
possible it may grow into a university after fll. Wash
ington has ceased to be a stagnant town. 'Whatever
is planted now in that city and is carefully tended is
apt to develop rapidly.' The Washington Memorial
Institute, therefore, may yet figure more largely in
the educational world than many a university that now
looks upon it as a. small thing. . Â¦'Â¦}/;

it is now the turn of the/ automobile to pass through the
experience of the steam : locomotive and the bicycle.
'Â¦ When the horse ,.came into, general use as an aid to man's
progression doubtless there was an outcry from the conserva
tive section of mankind that the death rate would be terribly
increased. Legs; it was, probably, feared, might become a thing
â¢of the. past, so far as concerned those who could ride or drive
horses, and in any case the horse, with his propensity to shy,
'buck and kick, was a dangerous thing to be 'avoided!
Â¦Â«Â¦' That was in the early, days of civilization. When the steam
engine, less than a hundred years ago, became a rival of the
horse, all these fears were loudly, expressed.- The railway en
gine came to stay, the horse remained. Both joined forces to
resist the interloping tendencies of the velocipede and bicycle.
Loud were the complaints against their capacity for causing
accidents. The outcry had hardly died away, three or four
years ago, when the wheel reached the acme of favor as a pop
ular means of locomotion. Another object now receives the
same r.tream of criticism. The automobile is the "dangerous
animal" of the day. â¢

last winter and spring, at the time when' the Sena

the iniquities of Tammany rule, and when thespecu

and. abominable in the way of corruption in politics,
must have confined his observations to very exclu-'
sive- company. He claims to have found most of the
Eastern newspapers dull,_ arid that may be another
evidence that he is purblind.
Be those things as "they may, we can afford to
overlook them for the sake of the generous commen
dation he has given of things he managed to see
clearly, and feel that he is justified in his closing state-'
ment, "that. the zeal for learning, justice and human
ity lies so deep in the American heart that it will in
the end solve the two grave problems which face the
future of their citizensâ the eternal struggle between
capital and laborâ the gulf between people of color
and the people of European blood." :
BY way of affording another demonstration of
the efficacy- of wireless telegraphy the New
York Herald has successfully operated the
Marconi system between the Cunard steamer Lu
cania and various stations along the coast of England
and Wales. The object of the demonstration in this
instance was to convince steamship men and others
of the value of the arrangements the Herald has made
to establish a wireless telegraph service on Nantucket
lightship. The experiments proved that a vessel at sea
can send messages to land and receive messages in
return even when the ship is not visible from the land,
nor the land station visible'from the ship. . -
â¢ For the purpose of making the experiment a Mar
coni apparatus was set up on top of the captain's
cabin while the Lucania lay at the Liverpool docks.
The battery was attached to a wire that was carried
from the cabin to the top of the mast. As soon as
the steamer left the docks and had got fairly into the
stream the interchange of telegrams began and proved
completely successful.
The report of the event says: "For several hours
after the Lucania had crossed thie bar of the Mersey
communication between the vessel and the land,
which very soon was lost to sight from her decks,
was maintained. First of all wireless messages were
sent from on board the outward bound steamer to. a
training ship stationed in the Mersey, the Conway,
and on which the Marconi apparatus had been in
stalled. Then there came a time, as the Lucania
crept along the coast of North Wales, when, the ves
sel got out of range, as it were, and communication
with the Conway ceased, only to be reopened with a
second station as the Cunarder turned the corner of
the island of Anglesey into St. George's. Channel.
This second station was at Holyhead, off the west
ern coast of Anglesey. Here, at its entrance, St.
George's Channel is some sixty miles across, and the
route followed by the Atlantic liners leaving Liver
pool lies well but toward midchannel, so that it is
rarely that the towering head can be seen by pas
sengers."
The messages sent back and forth were sufficiently
long and sufficiently various to prove the practical
value of the system for virtually all kinds of
telegraphing. It is thus made certain that not only
will the wireless telegraph at Nantucket lightship en
able the Herald to transmit news of the appearance of
a vessel in that part' of the sea, but if the vessel be
provided with a Marconi apparatus the captains ' or
the passengers can communicate with the lightship
and through that directly with New York.
This new accomplishment adds force to the efforts
that are now being made to have the United States
Government establish a similar system of telegraph
ing between the Farallon Islands and this city. The
matter is really one of urgency. It is one of impor
tance to the Government as well as to the city and to
comme'ree.
It is to be noted that the work of equipping ships
with the Marconi instruments has already been well
advanced on the Atlantic. Gustav Schwab, general
manager of the North German Lloyd, stated in a.
recent interview: "Already two of our steamships,
the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and Kaiserin Maria
Theresa, are equipped with wireless telegraph instru
ments, and on another of our new steamers a special
room is set apart for the accommodation of the
wireless telegraph apparatus."
Thus it will be seen that wireless telegraphy is rap
idly .coming f into general use. It has" been but a
short: time. since The Call first demonstrated the
availability of the system for the dispatch of news by
obtaining from a vessel at sea a report of the arrival
of the transport bringing home the California volun
teers, and now new steamers are being constructed
with rooms designed especially for wireless telegraph
ing. The invention has moved rapidly, and the Gov
ernment can hardly have a good excuse for neglecting
to make use of it between this city and the Farallones.

Midsummer Day Festival.
TTi<Â» Scandinavian Patriotic League,
composed of delegates appointed from the
varicus Scandinavian societies of San
Frar.cisco and adjoining cities, have per
fected elaborate arrangements for their I
annual "Midsummer Day" celebration, to
be held at Shell Mound Park to-morrow.
They promise that it will eclipse all pre
vious affairs of the kind, and judging from
the excellent programme arranged for the
day a. good time is assured. The pro
gramme offered by the different commit
tees consists of literary exercises, May
pole dances, races, parades, tableaus. il
luminations and fireworks.
That the compromise was made some
time ago is evidenced by the fact that on
May 11 Lucy Hite signed a release of all
hor claims to the property. A peculiar
fact in connection with the case is that
on May 11 her former attorneys, Rogers
& Paterson, C. J. Hanlon and J. A. Adair
were dismissed by mutual consent and J.
J. Trabucco and G. G. Goucher were en
gaged in their places.
.About two years ago Lucy Hite brought
hf r suit for divorce and a division of the
community property. She claimed that
she had been married to Hite in 1S70- and
the decision of the court upheld her asser

Court by Hite, but before action was
taken both parties legally signified that a
satisfactory agreement had been made
and that there was no cause for further
litigation.

The general committee on arrangements
for the Epworth League Convention is
working hard to be able to secure ample
accommodations for the 50,000 visitors who
are expected here In July. ! It has learned
with some consternation that every avail
able inch of space in the hotels of San
Francisco conducted on the American
plan has been engaged for the period over
Â¦which the convention extends by advance
agents of excursion companies. As the
omcials of the league have been assured
sufficient accommodations # for the dele
gates, the questionrls of great importance.
Accordingly the city nas been appor
tioned into districts and canvassers have
been sent out. who will visit every house
in the city and engage rooms wherever
possible. It Is thought that in this way
many thousands may be accommodated in
private dwelling houses as well as in ho
tels. The Lay cities are also being can
vassed and many of the visitors will be
lodged in Berkeley, Alameda and Oak
land.
Dr. Beard says that the attendance from'
east of the Rockies will far exceed the
early estimates. Information is received
daily of new excursions which are being
arranged by enthusiastic leaguers.
A party of 250 from Philadelphia has
lately arranged to take the trip. A "Ken
tucky special." which will make a wide
tour of the West, is announced from the
Blue Grass State. More than 1000 guests
are coming from Iowa. Florida will send
several hundred delegates. New York,
Pennsylvania. New Jersey, Illinois and
the New Knpland States promise as large
delegations as Iowa. Excursions will be
run from every State in the Union and
very cheap rates are obtainable.
Many well known excursion firms will
conduct trainloads of the visitors through
the scenic pi;rt of the West and to this
city. The outlook at present is said to be
very bright, and interest in the convention
is rapidly Increasing: throughout the coun

the'-body of the prisoner. The latter was
sick when taken aboard at Manila, and
getting worse at sea, managed to reach
the hospital when nobody was watching
and got into one of the cots. He was at
tended by the ship's surgeon and cared
for as a sick soldier and not as a pris
oner. When he died from dysentery-. the
body was embalmed and put away under
the- name jof another man.' Only" when
the prisoner was missed was the mistake
discovered. The boys on the Sherman now
assert that it is the ghdst of this soldier
that is haunting the ship, because even
in death he could not get an "honorable
discharge." * "
Among those on the transport who have
heard the blood-curdling noises .are S.
Crisp, i third assistant engineer; Vail
Cooney, electrician; Jack Orr and Tom
Dittman, water tenders; Sherman Sparks,
iceman, and Jim Harold. Wednesday last
while the men were all below Cooney
came staggering into their midst and ex
claimed, "Boys, I've seen it!" He was as
white as. a sheet and in a few seconds
fainted. Jim Harold says he saw and
talked with the spook, but he refuses
positively to give, out the message he re
ceived. S. Crisp heard the noise and in
vestigated, but could find no plausible rea
son for the sounds. All in all. they are a
puzzled crowd on the transport, and the
laugh will be on some of them when the
real cause of the noises is discovered. In
their sober senses not one of the men will
admit a belief in ghosts, but when it
comes to a question o f going below many
of them rub their injured shins and re
mark that the decks are not in goock con
dition for sprinting.
Nothing was seen, but the noises went on.
Now two of the men say they have seen
the spook, and one of them fainted in tell
ing his story. Many ludicrous incidents
have happened during the spook hunt and
more than one of the men. has barked
shins, received during a hurried run when
the cry "of â¢ "ghost" Â¦ was raised. : Â¦

A letter was received in reply

cation of Kern County to appear, before
him personally at Sacramento and show
cause why the State approprlatoin should

From investigations now going on in the
Assessor's office it has been ascertained
that Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Bank has been
accumulating an immense surplus by
shirking the payment of its taxes during
the past forty years. This is made pos
sible by a queer fiction of the law, and As
sessor Dodge ' is powerless to compel the
corporation to pay its Just share of the
expenses of the municipal government, al
though it receives abundant protection
therefrom. Notwithstanding the law's
defects Assessor Dodge has levied a fran
chise assessment of $1,000,000 on the con
cern, which has taken the matter .to
court. In discussing the subject Dodge
says: Â¦''Â¦.*> ;-':5Â£'Â»'* '
The report of Wells, Fargo & Co. to the Bank
Commissioners shows the paid-tip capital of the
company to be $300,000. The surplus and profits
amount to $8,593,532 and the amount due de
positors 17,103,836. The report further states
that Wells. Fargo & Co.'s branch banks in New
York, Salt Lake and Portland owe the San
Francisco branch $7,875,127. To the Assessor it
says that sum is its capital apportioned to its
branch 'banks to do business on and is there
fore not taxable In San Francisco.
Under the laws of California the company is
allowed to deduct the amount owing to de
positors from the amounts owing to the cor
poration, and thus a large assessment is saved
to the alien corporation. Notwithstanding It
has accumulated an immense surplus, mainly
from the patronage of the people of California,
it sees fit to incorporate in the State of Colo
rado, where it has little or no business.
Of Its capital and surplus amounting to
$9,088,532, it reports fl, 118, 249 Invested in real
estate, two million more in wagons, fixtures,
etc., of the many express offices and branches,
making a total of $3,118,249 of its capital used
for Its buildings, cafes and fixtures, and leav
ing a net working capital for banking business
of $5,980,283. As it tells the Assessor the
$7,875,127 in its branch banks is the working
capital of the branch banks 'outside of Califor
nia and not taxable here, it must follow that
$1,894,844 of the money deposited in this bank
by the people of California is sent out of the
State, and thus $3,989,6$$ escapes taxation. The
tax on four million dollars at present year's
rate is $65,000. This amount put out at interest
at 6 per cent would amount to $3900 a year and,
compounding the interest, the principal, sum
of $65,000 would reach $130,000. As the saving
goes on each year the immense surplus of
19.098,532 is mainly accumulated taxes that it
has escaped In years gone by. Slxty-flve thou
sand dollars a year spent In paving streets for
the last forty years would have been $2,600,000,

The field for their usefulness is large
and varied. War will cease to be, and
the nations of the earth will be at peace.
The unknown corners of the world will
be laid bare, and the dangers and de
lays of travel by land and by sea will
be eliminated, and California will have
the honor to be the mother of this great
invention. . â¢
It is now an assured fact that San
Francisco is to have the honor of float-
Ing the first successful ship of the air.
The Stanley type of airship has success
fully weathered the storms of legal com
plication and and is now an
chored safely" in the hands of a repre
sentative board cf directors, with I. J.
Truman at its head as president, which
In Itself will stimulate confidence in the
public who are investing their money In
the enterprise."
The California Aerial Navigation Com
pany, who are the successors of the
old Stanley Aerial Navigation Com
pany, have purchased all_that company's
holdings, including its patent rights, and
are issuing shares in the new company
to the stockholders of the old company,
share for share. We see no reason why
the public in general should not come
forward and assist in this most worthy
undertaking. That the air is bound to be
Euccessfully navigated on a commercial
basis is no longer denied by scientific
men who have given thought and study
to this important branch. Von Zeppe
lin's great- ship and its successful
flight and aerial evolutions have demon
strated beyond a doubt that ships of the
air will be as common as automobiles
in the very near future.

William H. Newman Re-elected ty
! Directorate. to Manage Interests
â¢ "-Â¦Â¦:. of the Vanderbilts.
'â¢ NEW vYORK, June 21.â The directorates
of severalof the Vanderbilt railroads met
at the Grand Central, depot to-day. The
most important action ' taken at any of
the meetings was the re-election of Wil
liam H. Newman as president of the Lake
Shore and Michigan Southern Railway
Company and . the election of W. C.
Brown, late general manager of the Chi
cag%, Burlington and Quincy, as addition
al vice president and general manager for
both the Lake Shore and Michigan South
ern and the Lake Erie and 'Western rail
roads. .
It had been anticipated that, in view of
Mr.. Newman's elevation to the presidency
â¢of the New York Central, a successor to
him In the Lake Shore would be chosen,
and severalnamee were suggested in con
nection with the succession.. The. action
finally taken is regarded as an indication
that the policy of the Vanderbilts in the
future will be to have but one president
for their entire system, with a vice presi
dent in charge of each - of the several
properties composing it.
E. D. Worcester was reflected vice
president of the Lake Shore road. The
directors of the. latter also declared the
usual semi-annual dividend of 3% per cent
and made, it payable July 29. The treas
urer's statement for the first half of 1901
showed gross .earnings of $13,485,508, an in
crease of. 5.95 : per cent, and , net . earnings
of. $4,462,028, a decrease, of 4.7. per cent.
THIRTEEN- YEAR-OLD BOY

Charged With Shooting and Bobbing
a Wealthy Farmer of a Large
Sum of Money.
WYFIELD, Kans., June 21.â This after
noon the jury in the Betts murder case
rendered a verdict of not' guilty. The boy,
who is 13 years old, was in the courtroom
with his mother and father and an broke
into tears, the boy weeping like a baby.
It has not been decided when Clyde
Moore, Betts* chum, will have his trial.
The charge against both was the killing of
C. L. Wiltberger on Aprill8. The jury
was out since yesterday morning. .Betta
is the son of Charles Betts. an ex-police
man of Arkansas City, who is In county
politics. Moore is the son of William
â¢Moore,- a machinist of Arkansas City. On
April 18 Wiltberger, a. well-to-do farmer,
was killed by a shot from behind. He had
been to town and sold a load of wheat.
While on his way home he was killed, his
body being found in the bottom of his
wagon, and his pockets rifled. Betts and
Moore. ran away from 'home and took
with them a revolver. Each boy upon the
stand said the other had a revolver on the
afternoon of the murder. Betts proved a
fairly good alibi.

BERLIN, June 2Lâ The â¢ libel action
brought by Dr. Lyxnan of the Leipsic
Xeuste Xachrichten against Dr. Schmidt,
Dr. Lock and the Cologne Gazette, aris
ing from Dr. Lyman's assertion that, the
De Beers Company- sent 1,200,000 marks to
Cologne for political purposes, has re
sulted as follows: â
Dr. Schmidt is sentenced to pay a fine
of 100 marks, or undergo ten days' im
prisonment,,, and Dr. Lock is sentenced to
pay a fine of 200 marks, or be imprisoned
for twenty days. The court also decided
that while the Cologne Gazette was nat
urally irritated by the assertion made, the
manner in which the assertion was repu
diated was offensive.
In the course of the trial to-day Herr
Jar.sen, attorney for Dr. Lyman. offered
to prove the assertions of his client, and
named many witnesses who, he asserted,
would give evidence that a syndicate com
posed of the De Beers and other South
African companies has a large fund in the
Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited,
at Salisury, Rhodesia, for political pur
poses; that this fund is held without di
rect accountability to the members of the
syndicate; that the syndicate paid Herr
Gehl, the Pretoria correspondent of the
Cologne Gazette, 4000 marks a month; that
Gehl admitted having been bribed by the
syndicate: that Gehl was court-martialed
and sentenced to death as a traitor to the
Boers, and that a check from the syndi
cate for 209,000 marks was found among
Gehl's effects. The court declined to hear
Herr Jansen's testimony because Herr
Gehl was not on tria!.

Money Was Illegally Used for

The Judge explained that he had ad
mitted certain evidence not because it
had anything to do with the case, but be
cause it was for the jury to*determine if
it had anything to do with making the
defendant criminally irresponsible. If they
believed the defendant was sane at the
time of the shooting they must convict.
The jury's only ballot was unanimous
for guilty and a unit for the highest de
gree charged.
Keller was absent. He showed no emo
tion when subsequently told of the ver
dict. Barker had expected an acquittal.
He based a strong hope upon the plea of
his counsel, but it was swept away by the
cold charge of the court. '
Mrs. Barker was not in the courtroom
to -hear the verdict. She was in another
part of the courthouse, and when told of
the verdict sobbed bitterly.
Barker to-nlgrht. found himself once
more an inmate of the County Jail. He
must remain there until $10,000 bail is fur
nished. Before him stands' a. possible
term of seven years' Imprisonment and a
fine of as much as $2000.
NEW YORK, June 2Lâ The Jury before
â¢which Thomas G. Barker df-- Arlington,
N. J.. was tried for shooting- with intent
to kill Rev. John Keller of the same town,
took one ballot this afternoon and then
returned a verdict of guilty. The jurors
were told that they must decide only If
Barker with intent to kill fired at Keller.
That was the law and they must obey it.
Notice of an appeal was given by Bar
ker's counsel. s

LOS ANGELES, June 2Lâ The efforts of
the City Council to secure 4-cent street
car fares in Los Angeles are meeting with
considerable opposition. The street rail
way owners declare that it costs 4 1 ,; cents
apiece to' carry passengers. One of tho
franchises recently granted contained a
4-cent clause, and It was the intention of
the Council to Insert such a provision in
future franchises. In view of the attitude
of many citizens, however, it is quite pos
sible that the matter will be dropped.

' SACRAMENTO. June 21.â Among .- thÂ»
musical events of the week the two pfano
recitals given by pupils of Miss Mamie C.
Barrett were of exceptional interest. The
pupils presented interesting programmes,
which were received with enthusiasm by
musical audiences. Miss Barrett has evi
dently Inspired her pupils with a sense of
self-reliance and. pride in their work. She â¢
ha3 been successful In a marked degree
in imparting to her pupils her methods aa
obtained In study with Professor Barth of
Berlin. From the youngest to the oldest
pupil there 13 a depth of tone, absolute
ease and relaxation, combined with artis
tic phrasing 'and firmness of touch.
Mrs. Adams played "Erlkonig." by
Schubert-Liszt, with dramatic intensity.
A deMghtful" contrast was the Rubensteih
barcarolle played by Mrs. Varney with
much taste and exoression. Mrs. Collins
played with brilliancy the difficult waltz
by Moszkowskl. Two pleasing sploa were
those played by Miss Cantrell and Miss
Jost. In playing "The Nightingale." by
Liszt Miss Gowan showed much artistic
taste and refinement of expression, while
the Mendelssohn concerto gave her an op
portunity to display brilliancy.
The duo "Norma, played by Miss Pope
and Mrs. Adams, and the final quartet,
"Tannhauser." by Wagner, were 1 very at
tractive numbers. Among the younger
pupils who showed artistic work were Lily
Sherman, Irene Glfford, Ellta Kins and

The investigation of the riot last Wed
nesday night lias failed to bring results
and all the prisoners, including the two
over whose arrest the riot started, have
been released. The town authorities were
given every opportunity to identify the
trouble-makers,, and they Â¦ were given
every assistance by the camp officers, but
they failed to pick out a man for punish
ment, and so General Dickinson let them
all go in default of a complaint against
them. The general was willing to turn
over the two original prisoners or to pun
ish them if a formal complaint were
made, but the town authorities dropped
the matter altogether. Since then, how
ever, Genral Dickinson has a platoon of
cavalry patrolling the town as a provost
guard every night. \ ,
Joseph Walters, Company B, Second In
fantry, was 8hotin the hand and leg to
day while snapping his revolver. Ho had

his hand and lodged in, his thigh, where
it now is. It broke no bones, but the
man's wounds are serious.
Colonel Charles Sonntag, of the Gover
nor's staff, was . thrown from his horse
while on the way to camp this afternoon
and he was so badly- cut about the. face
and eyes that his wounds had â¢ to be
stitched. He came to camp later, looking
â¢much the worse for wear, but declaring
he was not much hurt. Â¦

TACOMA, Wash., June 21.â Because tho
Western American Company would not
sell its eight-mile coal road from Car
bonado to Fairfax the Northern Pacific
Railway has determined to parallel the
line and, in addition, build from Fairfax
to the Carbon River and Tahoma mining
districts.' These districts are ready to sup
ply immense ore shipments and the West
ern American Company had planned to ex
tend them as rapidly as possible.
Unwilling to be beaten In a paralleling
game, the Western American Company
announces its decision to parallel the
Northern Pacific 'from Caronado to Ta
coma, with a branch line to Seattle. ThiÂ»
is the best paying part. of the Northern
Pacific, since over the thirty miles of
track named pass the immense coal ship
ments brought from the Pittsburg. Gaie
Creek, Wilkeson, Roslyn and Carbonado
mines. The Western American Company
is a rich corporation, backed by English
capitalists of immense wealth. This fact
give3 weight to its announcements and
leads both railroad and mining men to
believe that Its plan will be carried out.
The railroad fight started in this way: *
Two years ago the Western American
Company began developing its mines at
Fairfax. Last summer It built a railroad
from Fairfax to a connection with, the
Northern Pacific at Carbonado. Laat fall
the Northern Pacific by order of President
Mellen commenced opening its Rain.or
coal mines near Fairfax, which are also
tributary to the Western American Com
pany's road. The Northern Pacific offered
$150,000 for the road, but the Western
American Company declined to sell unless
Â¦ the Northern Pacific would also purchase
the Fairfax mines for $330,000 additional.
The railroad refused, and commenced sur
veys for its parallel lines. This line has
been located, bids for its construction
were opened to-day, and the contract Â¦will
be let very soon.
The Western American Company claims
that it can haul its own coal from Fairfax
to Tacoma at one-fourth of the cost
charged by the Northern Pacific, besides
doing an Immensely profitable business
for other mines. As the Carbon River
canyon ia very narrow above Fairfax it
is doubtful whether more than one road
can build from there to the Carbon River
and Tacoma mining districts, . where are
located rich copper mines now being
opened by the Montezuma Mining Com
pany and the Washington Co-operative
Mining Syndicate. Both companies are
ready to make large shipments to Tacoma
smelters as soon as transportation is pro
vided.

also silent, but was one of the features
that will make this camp a pattern to fol

of the ambulances as they bumped over
the rough ridges of the parade ground.

ney Delmas occupied most of the time.
He contended that the evidence hail not
shown there was an iraplied contrtr;t as
to the services Miss Smalley was to ren
der Murphy, neither was an expressive
rontract proven. The relations of Miss
Smalley and the dead capitalist were, he
said, that of husband and wife, and while
they were not married they passed as
married persons, and she had no ground
to bring suit for services rendered in car
ing for him. The charge was declared to
be exorbitant.
At 4 o'clock Attorney Kowalsky opened
his argument, and will finish it to-mor

services rendered.

EAYS THAT THE WOMAITS

SEATTLE. Wash.. June 21.â Tlie steam
ship Jeanie arrived from Nome this morn
ing with sixteen oassengers. -Word was
received in Nome by | J. Goodyear , of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company which
confirmed the news of the drowning [ of
William Small, Henry Avery, Thomas
Ca:>well. Thomas Jones and Abe Appell.
They left St. Michael with the . stern
wheeler Anaconda and started for the
Koskokwlm via Bristol Bay about the
middle of July. Word came from a mis
sionary at Bethel Mission, which is near
the mouth of the Koskokwlm, that* part
of the Anaconda drifted on the beach
near the mission during the fall, which
confirms the fear of their friends that
they have all lost their lives.
In an interview with a correspondent
at Nome, Judge Noyes said in reply to a
query as to the charges against him:
"I do not care at the present time to
make, any statement- regarding, the
charges, for I am entirely ignorant of the
r-aiure of the charges, if any . have been
preferred against me to the Attorney Gen
eral, and have received no official or even
private notification that charges are pend
ing-. I, of course, can pay no attention to
public rumor. I even have not received a
copy of the decision written by Judge
Ross of th*e XInth Circuit Court of Ap
peals In the McKenzie contempt cases. I,
however, read excerpts from, that decision
and if the charges are based upon the
statement of the record as contained in
that decision I will be fully prepared to
meet them. I cannot say more than. this
at the present time, as I do not desire
to criticize or^ deprecate the' decision of
Judge Ross.
"The time may come, and soon, I think,
when Judge Roes will acknowledge that
in making a personal attack upon me he
was in the wrong and that his statements
with regard to me personally are without
foundation. I have been very busy all
winter, holding court almost continuously
since September last, and have not had
time to consider or prepare any statement
in answer to the numerous stories which

do not see my way clear for much leisure
during the coming summer, for as soon as
this special term closes I am due at St.

hold a regular term commencing the third

ALTURAS, June 21.â There is a feeling
cf terror In Lookout, a sense of forebod
ing that the clutch of the law is upon the
ringleaders of the mob that lynched Cal
vin Hall, his three sons and Dan Yantis.
Already three men are in the jail here and
the officers are looking for others with
â¢what seems to be a pretty good chance of
petting them.
The investigation made by the Grand
Jury of Modoc County is bearing fruit,
and the shadow of the gallows stretches
wider and darker' over the isolated little
village from which the five men were
taken at night and Bent to their death
without even so much as a moment for
undisturbed prayer.
The men in the jail are Robert Leven
ton, J. W. Brown and Isom Eadcs. These
persons were indicted by the Grand Jury
and a charge of murder,. has been writ
ten after the name of each. They are ac
cused of having been ringleaders of the
mob and to have had a chief part In the
lynching of the young son of Calvin Hall.
An offer of bail was refused. For several
days Leventon has been seriously ill and
he was barely able to come here at the
Sheriff's behest.
It is said by officials that there is proof
that not more than twelve or fifteen men
composed the mob. . In all probability
every man will be apprehended. Judge
Harrington is using ail possible means to
uncover the crime and says he thinks the
officers are in possession of evidence that
Â¦wilL convict more than the three men -who
are now In custody. The men arrested
made no resistance and came willingly.
They proclaimed tlwir innocence and pay
they ar* ignorant of everything pertain
ing to the affair.

AMP GAGE, SANTA CRUZ. June
f[ 2Lâ Down the ridge of the big pa
ll â¢ . rade ground the division marched
r^^ to-day in the biggest, best and
most military review the National
Guard of this State has seen. The week
in camp has given" the troops the swing
and steadiness of old campaigners. Tho
sun has browned them, and the dust has
settled on their accouterments. There
was nothing of the armory or 1 he carpet
about them; there was none of the Bide
walk gait. They trod the rough ground
cf the ridges as if to bear arms was their
business as well as their pleasure, and
as. the battalions swung on the hillside"
and crossed and recrossed crests and
rl<".ges they looked a force that any man
might well be proud to lead.
- The review was set for 6:30 o'clock. At
2 o'clock General Shatter arrived In
camp, accompanied by Colonel Plunvmer,
his aid, and the- guns snapped out his
official welcome of thirteen from under
the> flagstaff at division headquarters. He
went at once to General Warneld's head
quarters. He - was In full uniform and
wore upon" 1 his breast nearly a score of
medals that years of service have brought
to Mm. â¢
Soon after 3 o'clock Governor Gage ar
rived and again the guns started the'
echoes, this time with seventeen. Gover
nor Gage was met at the Sea Beach Hotel
by Troop A of the cavalry, under com
mand of Captain Jansen, which escorted
him to the camp. When the Governor's
carriage" arrived at headquarters . he had
with him General. Shafter, who had Joined
him, General Scamans and Colonel Plum
mer. General Dickinson and his staff
were waiting to receive him and . there
Â¦was a feeneral introduction. TUe Gov
ernor's staff had followed after the car
riage and they, too. Joined the' throng at
headquarters and* added to the handshak
ing. Then the Governor, General Shafter
and General . Dickinson entered the car
riage and drove through the camp.

In the meantime the regiments' were
making for the parade grotind and began
to form under their brigadiers and on

with the Sixth Infantry as his leading

Then the- order to advance was given.
As the bugle called the orders from, bri

the^ commands, and at once the mass of
men in blue took life and action. -Guidons

"Forward, march!" I came clear and
sharp, and with the blare of the, Sixth In
fantry band playing with s the echoes
among the hills, the head of . the column
came down the ridge. General Muller rode
ahead with his staff, leading the finest col
umn of Guardsmen that has ever trod the
hills of the State. On it came, steady and
straight, .the spatter, of the drunks break
ing into the brazen i notes of ; the band,

Colonel Miles, assistant adjutant Keneral,
the bugle sent the "attention" thrilling
over tho ridge, and the battalion settled
into rigidity. It dressed on a long line of
signal flags that had been set to mark the

Chicago Grain Market.
Subsiding activity and an casing off of quo
tations have marked the present week, in "Wall
street. The declines have not been . severe and
there was no dcided sign of liquidation. It
would seem, however, that a number of causes
combined to check speculation and to create a
conservative feeling on the part of the large
interests which have been leading the market.
There Is no fear at present of stringency I In,
the money market, the reduction of the | New
Tork, banks' surplus reserves to* $18,000,000 last
Saturday and the shipment of some HGOO.OOO
gold to Germany created a feeling' that rates
are necessary and unavoidable at least until
the July Interest and dividend payments are
completed. These payments will be the largest
on record, and thouRh the shifting of balances
In no case is no longer attended by such a dis
turbance of the loan market as was formerly
to be expected, it is thought that some pres
sure may be expected, and that any expansion
of speculation . would Â¦ not .be advisable. ' Thib
seems to have been the chief limitation on the
activity of the market and the principal reason
for the halt in its progress, though weight must
also be given to the uncertainty which still-ex
ists as to the crop outlook, reports of less fa
vorable weather conditions of the West -having
had more or less Influence on the temper of the
market.. Another factor which Impressed the
street was the modification of the sanguine
views held a week- ago about the 1 probability
of a. big deal in coun.ectlo'h with -the St. Paul
road. It now seems that the community of in
terest people will be applied In the.caseof
St. Paul and the other Western roads,' but that
there will be no exchange of securities at high
figures and assumption of control by the Union
Pacific. . . ' - - . - Â¦ -.

NEW TORK. June ;iâ The prospect of a
better bank statement to-morrow than has
been expected caused a more cheerful feeling
in the stock market to-day. Advances were
<juite wide in some quarters of the market
and there was an appreciable increase in the
interest in the market, the dealings again
rising over the half-million mark. The appre
hensions which have been felt regarding the
effect of the week's gold exports were allvi
ated by the publication of the preliminary es
timates of the cash movement of the week,
which showed that several factors had co-op
erated to offset the outgo of gold. The most
impcnant of these was a. large Influx of
oath, attracted irom the Interior by the hard
er money rates here. This movement has ap
parently served to offset the drain to the sub
treasury and left a margin of gains for the
banks of over a million dollars. The sub
trc-aeury operations themselves, although they
include the payments for almost $5,000,000 of
cold exjKTted. showed an actual withdrawal
lrora the market of only $2,251,000. The month's
high level of pension payments, the repay
ments for bonds redeemed under the offer of
the Secretary of the Treasury and the redemp
tion of checks issued against deposits of gold
in San Francisco and Seattle are the offsetting
1 actors. The changes in the loan Item are, of
ccuj-m, problematical. Rumors were rife of
the liquidation of some heavy corporation
lean?. ; The completion of the subscription pay
ments on the new Pennsylvania Etock. which
was issued to reimburse the company for re
cent purchases of stocks in other companies,
affords moans for the liquidation of the large
loans incurred while the purchases were being
made. The Pennsylvania collateral loans on
t-.;is account were stated at over $20,000,000 in
the annual rej>ort. . and this admittedly had
l.-wn added to Flnce the explicit statement was
made to-<3ay that these loans had been paid
"his week, but no authentic information could
be obtained on the subject. The tone of the
monfy market was easier to-day. A new
version of the St. Paul deal to-day had
it that the block of 250,000 shares of
ft. Paul etock recently reported sold
to Union Pacific Interests was In fact to
Yx- exchanged for an amount of Union Pacific
stock estimated at an equal value, thus furth
ering the establishment of community of In
terest. There was renewed buying by some of
Â«he larfe speculative operators who have been
quiescent this week. Union Pacific was car
ried 3 points over last night and St. Paul at
r-ne time 2. although the latter stock reacted.
Reports that a working agreement â¢ had been
rrranged l>etween Pennsylvania and the Wa
bash caused the Wabash securities to Jump,
the common stock rising l?i. the preferred 3*4
and the debenture B bonds 4%. Missouri Pa
cific also rose 2% later In the flay. Canadian
Pacific rose >4, followed by some of Its Fub
s'.diary lines, apparently on the hope of a
Etr'.ke settlement.
The strength of New Tork Central Â«eemed
to be associated with the dividend meeting!)
cf the Vanderbllt companies. People's Gas was
ir.arked sp over 2 points on the prospect of a
contract with the Chicago authorities. Amer
ican â¢ Linseed preferred rose 4 on the advance
in the price of the product. Local ' traction
rtocks were strong, led by â¢ Manhattan. .: and
Sucar showed a good gain but without ex
r-ls-natlon. Colorado Fuel selling ex-divldend
rhowed a gain at one time of 4%. but saved
cn:y 2 points net caln. General Electric, after
rising 20 points, broke 8. There was an un
usually large numher of low-priced railroad
and Industrial stocks, which are not usually
E<tive. that rose from 1 to 4 points without ex
planation. The market closed quiet and steady
and with some stocks celling at the top. Amal
gamated Copper, during the latter part of the
<Ja*\ fully recovered its decline. . which had ex
tended to 1%. The speculative railroad bonds
Â¦were <ruite generally active and strong. " Total
saler. par value. $4,185,000. United States
bonds were all unchanged on the last call.

New York Grain arid Produce.
A year ago the trade was beginning to realize
the extent of Injury by drought in epripg wheat
States, and. in a. few days about eight cents
was added to -the price. As the season ad-,
vances crop conditions steadily, improve, and in
some States the! winter wheat is being, har
vested. Â¦ No severe drop in quotations is an
ticipated,-however, for the crop is by no means
beyond danger in the Northwest, and even a
yield equal to the largest estimate may be
Â¦required if the most gloomy foreign fears are
realized. Instead of raising sufficient for her
own needs, France 1 has come forward as an
enormous purchaser, and other foreign nations
are dependent on imports . to an unusual ex
tent. In three weeks exports from Atlantic
ports have been 10,410,316 bushels, against 8,823,
388 bushels last year and 6,504,262 bushels in
1899.- ; : V . .
For the last, week the movement from the
Eastern seaboard does not show the usual gain
over . last year, but -Pacific shipments were
950.100 bushels, against 516,433 in 1900.- : -'
' Failures ' for the week numbered 193 In the
United States, against 174 last year- and 14 in
Canada, against 15 last year.;
The woolen goods " industry has a more en
couraging aspect than at any time for many
months, and a more hopeful feeling is enter
tained as to the volume of new orders about
to come forward. ' â¢ ...
Leather reflects the decreased" needs of shops,
though' heavy stock commands . top figures ow
ing to scarcity. /Â¦ "
Quotations are - shaded about IVt cents on a
few goods, particularly boots, . and . fall
deliveries are more quiet. The more fortunate
manufacturers have business to occupy shops
to the end of August. Â¦ .'. â¢ -
Less . interruption . through labor controversies
at machine shops makes the iron and steel in
dustry more fully employed than In recent
.weeks, and for another week> there is assurance
of vigorous activity at mills and furnaces. In
many instances promised j deliveries cannot be
made before July 1, and urgent business that is
now i offered cannot be undertaken. It is also
noticed that much foreign business is available,
but manufacturers refuse ' to make bids. . On
the 'other, hand it is stated , that quiet condi
tions will soon be the rule and fires will go
out , for the Â¦ customary summer overhauling.
This may , be the 'case at' a few plants, . - al
though the requirements of the railroads and
other known, needa are such as to render any
general suspension very important. Large sales
of Bessemer pig reported last week have since
been denied, and foundry lÂ»on is now the fa
vorite, especially at Southern points. No al
teration is recorded in prices, aside from a
moderate reduction in gray forge.
No decrease is seen in shipments of boots and
shoes from .Boston, forwardings continuing far
in excess of other years, but actual production
of the shops. is slightly reduced. and there is
less new business offered.
Increasing distribution of merchandise.- par
ticularly in the territory beyond the Ohio River,"
including' the far . Northwest, is a feature \ of
the general business situation and tells of wide
spread prosperity and confidence.' ; ; The -rail
roads" are" carrying more goods ; that may be
classed as luxuries , than Â¦ ever beforehand | in
spite of Wall street's slightly -higher money
market there > is ! no fear on this score in any
line 'of legitimate trade. â¢ Crop news continues
good,' there iÂ» : less trouble from j disagreements
with labor and the cotton market has recovered
slightly. ; f â¢ _. â¢. - V i Â¦

at the drill hole were instantly killed.
About twenty-five men were working in
a cut, and from the survivors it is learned
that Thomas Graham and Hugh Jamison,
both of Portland, were loading a twelve
foot drill hole with giant powder and had
put in about one hundred sticks. It is
supposed that they had just begun tamp

had sometimes done before, 'when the
explosion occurred. â¢

was blown to fragments and Scotty

a distance of fifteen feet. His injuries are
fatal. His chin was blown off, skull frac

ing for the lightning that should hurl him
into the permanent ranks. Hundley has
been a special policeman and is now made

place of Henry McClay, retired. The Com
missioners appointed J. H. Walters a
substitute to serve in the place of C. H.

The complaint was then read by request

Julius Steen, a medical student residing
at 760 Thirteenth street, and Mervyn
Samuels, of 1307 West street, have re
ported to the police a desperate struggle
with a man, evidently insane, who at
tacked them shortly after midnight this
morning at Eighth and Market streets as
they were on their way home from San
Francisco. Both young men were badly
battered in the fight f.ith their uncanny
asailant, whom ti>ry describe as of pow
erful physique. During the scuffle in the
dark he muttered Incoherently, at times
giving vent to maniacal cries.
Steen and Samuels came home together
from the city and alighted from the local
train at the Market-street station a little
after 12 o'clock. They had gone about a
block up Market when they saw a man
running about a vacant inclosure which,
they were approaching-. As they neared
the place the man vaulted the fence and
rushed toward them shouting "I've been
looking for you." Before either of the
young men had time to offer any defense
he had seized both in a crushing embrace
and hustled them along the walk In the
direction from which they came.
The lunatic's strength seemed for a
time irresistible, but after being dragged
half a block Steen wrenched himself free.
Lifting Samuels bodily from the ground
the mysterious stranger held him above
his head and started to run down Market
street, Samuels calling loudly for help.
Steen had no difficulty in catching the
madman and struck him several blows,
which caused him to relinquish his hold
on Samuels. Then the two friends took
to their heels and escaped. They were
able to give the police a good description
of their assailant.

Plans for the Tunnel.
NEW YORK, June 2Lâ The Pennsylva
nia Railroad is not only planning the ex
penditure of millions of dollars for im
mense docks on the Atlantic shore of
Long Island and others at Bay Ridge, in
New York harbor, but proposes to tunnel
East River and New York City to the
vicinity of Thirty-third street and Broad
way, otherwise known as Herald Square.
Herald Square Is to be the hub of the
metropolis of the Western Hemisphere.
So says William H. Baldwin Jr., presi
dent of the Long Island Railroad Com
pany, who summed up the motives which
actuated the officials of that company in
deciding to have a tunnel under East
River, with one terminus in Long Island
Cit:\ the other to be in the very heart
of the up-town business center.
The Pennsylvania Company, as is
known, has acquired control of the Long
Island Railroad. Further than this, it
was reported to-day that the Pennsylva
nia Company was negotiating for the ac
quisition of a charter for a tunnel under
the Narrows, from Fort Hamilton to Sta
ten Island. Should the Pennsylvania
Company obtain a charter and build a
tunnel under the Narrows, it could cross
Staten Island, and. by going over Arthur
Kill bridge, establish direct connection
with its Perth Amboy division.

Some of the occupants of the rooms
dropped from the windows and were
bruised. Others hung from the windows
until the firemen came. Twenty persona
were taken down through the fire and
Emoke by the firemen, while others
dropped into life nets.
Daniel Dooley, who was in the yard
when the explosion took place, saw the
two Rittenburg children in the rear room
and rushed into the flames for them. He
got one of them and carried it out and
he tried to go back for the other, but the
room was then one mass- of fire and he
was too late. He was badly scorched ia
rescuing the first child.
While the rescues were going on the
firemen were fighting the flames. Cap
tain Allen led with a hose line in an ef
fort to keep the fire from the upper floors,
where it was said many were penned in.
The men had hardly taken their positions
and begun on the sidewalk to throw water
Into the upper floors when, without any
warning, the whole upper part of the
building above them sagged outward and
fell. The captain and two of his men
were buried under the blazing debris. One
of the men Is badly hurt. The building In
which the explosion occurred was de
stroyed.
Rittenburg will probably be arrested
pending an investigation.
In the debris was found the head of a
man or woman. The hair was burned off
and the features unrecognizable. The re
mainder of the body has not been found.
The bodies taken out thus far are almost
unrecognizable and are burned and torn
by the fire and the collapse of the build
ing.
Heroic Work of the Firemen.
The building in which the explosion oc
curred was a frame tenement, four
stories high, with stores on the ground
floor. The middle store was occupied by
Rittenburg. Ten families occupied flats
in the building. So great was the forc3
of the explosion that a boy playing in the
street half a block away was lifted from
his feet and hurled against an iron fence.
One of his legs was broken. A trolley
car was directly in front of the building
when the explosion ooouried. Tne btfrsl
of flame blown out into the street

the hair of the passengers.
\ number of those who were on the up
per floors of the build'ng when the ex
plosion took place were either stunned
and then burned to death or found escape
cut off and were suffocated. After the
first explosion there was a succession of
smaller ones, and then came a second tjiÂ£
explosion which was muffled and dead
ened It probably occurred in the cellar.
Every window seemed to be emitting
flames within a minute after the first ex
plosion. A woman, her clothing on fire,
leaped out of one of the windows and fell
to the yard below. Her dead body was
dragged out of reach of the flames. The
flesh was roasted and dropped from the
bones. She proved to be .Mrs. Williams.

yesterday to the affidavit presented by
Mrs. Craven In support of her motion j to
transfer the hearing of the petition filed
by the children of the late James G. Fair
for distribution to them of the personal

Charles L. Fair states: "That Mrs. Cra

R. Craven Fair, is not the widow of the
late James G. Fair as she alleges, is not
entitled to any portion of decedent's
estate, and furthermore her allegation
that Â¦ Judsre Troutt is prejudiced against

Walter Sailing Is Being

which they are out $500. Yesterday ex-
Judge Allen, attorney for the bank, vis
ited police headquarters and endeavored
to secure a warrant for. the arrest of _ the
alleged forger, whose name is said to bo
Walter Sailing. Up to within a few
months Sailing, who is : said to be
well connected, was employed by; W. :M.

221 Front street. He was discharged^
several weeks ago. and, failing to pro
cure other employment, he went to'Chi

check -was cashed â¢â¢ by ' a- Chicago bank

BANK OFFICIALS
CLEVERLY DUPED
The internal dissensions in the families
of James H. Doolittle of the St. Nicholas
Hotel and Major Joseph Knowlton, his
brother-in-lajtv, are taking a wide rami
fication, as Dr. Henry S. Welch, father of
Lieutenant Â¦ "Welch, who married -Miss
Knowlton," has jumped into the breach to
defend the character of the father of his
daughter-in-law. ;
Dr. Welch and his wife have lived at the
St. Nicholas for the past seven years.' The
arrest of Major Knowlton on the charge
of felony embezzlement on complaint. of
Doolittle, followed by the threat by Doo
little that he would swear out sixteen
other warrants for Knowlton' s arrest on
the charge of misdemeanor embezzlement,
roused .Dr. -Welch to a pitch of fury.
Thursday Â¦- night he declared to several
other guests in the hotel that he would
kill Doolittle and he raised such a . dis
turbance that he was arrested by Police
man Nolting on a charge of disturbing the
peace and Ueing drunk.- He\Was released
on cash bail, but yesterday morning when
! he received notice to leave the Â¦ hotel he
[made another display of his feelines to
ward Doolittle and .raised such a racket
that he was again arrested for disturbing
the peace. Doolittle also swore to. a com
plaint charging him' with threats to kill,
which was â¢ served on him in the City
Prison. On this charge his bonds were
fixed in 52000 or $1000 cash.
Dr. Welch was taken before Judge
Slogan and in answer to the Judge said:
"I might have spoken in a loud voice;
but my voice isnaturally shrill. I had no
intention of' disturbing the peace. I ob
jected to this dirty business. . My son is
married to a daughter of Major Knowlton
and I believe the major is being wrongful
ly treated. I have been a guest â¢ In the
hotel for the past seven years." The doc
tor talked in such a loud voice that the
Judge had to caution him that he was not
deaf. He was sent to the City Prison ana
the cases continued till to-day. â¢-.;Â¦â¢â¢- 't : ->.
It â¢Â¦ was arranged yesterday in Judge
Fritz's court that Major Knowlton should
get his clothing and personal effects from
the St. .- Nicholas ' Hotel and In Judge Mo
gan's court that no warrants would-; be
sworn out for his arrest on . the charge" of
misdemeanor embezzlement till after the
Judge had given his decision on the
motion to dismiss the felony charge of
embezzlement i against Ki.owlton, which
will be argued this morning.

The story goes that Mr. Loud promised
to support Colonel George Stone for Post
master, Â¦ but the latter -wanted something
different. The position that suits Colonel
Stone's fancy Is gracefully if not per
manently filled by Colonel John P. Irish.
When one talks to the President it may
be assumed that oner speaks his mind. So
when Colonel Stone told the President
that he preferred the naval office it is fair
to infer that he was not talking through
his tile. Wise men of, the East and
prophets of the West predict that there
will bo no immediate change in the naval
office. Colonel Irish,- the holder, possesses
many Christian virtues, some inherited,
some achieved and others thrust Â¦ upon
him,, but resignation, an admirable virtue
withal, Is not a prevailing one. He will
not resign. He will not be removed.
Hence Colonel Stone must build his hopes
on either the death or promotion of Col
onel Irish. Meanwhile Colonel.Stone may
solace himself with the reflection that the
position was not bestowed upon one hold
ing lesser rank than that of colonel.

THE BEPTJBUCA1T LEAGUE.
Active "Work on th.c Line of District
Organization.
A large delegation of active Republicans
of the Twenty-ninth Assembly District
visited the headquarters of the Republican
Primary â¢ League in , the Baldwin Annex
last^evening. .The directors of the league
were assured that the movement for
municipal .government will be earnestly
supported by the anti-boss Republicans of
the Twenty-ninth District.
' The" league last night resolved to ap
point - an : executive | committee of eleven
prominent Republican citizens to assist
the board of directors In the work of the
municipal campaign. The names will
probably be. announced , to-night. The
plans of district ' organization adopted by
the league are simple and promise to se
cure the co-operation â¢ of an â¢ army of Res
publican voters; One hundred books, each
containing perforated . blanks, with stubs
for twenty-five names, will be sent to
every one of the eighteen Assembly dis
tricts/ -It is possible therefore by -active
work in canvassing to obtain 2500 members
in- a district. .The canvassers are the hold
ers of the-books, and all Republicans will
be â¢ requested to join the movement- for
good Â¦ government under ; the auspices of
the Republican party. ; ' -
' Last evening the league was engaged in
framing an address to the Republican
voters of ; San Francisco Â¦ urging all who
have not registered for the primary elec
tion to register without delay." One of the
chief purposes of 'â¢ the . organization is to
awaken the citizens to a- sense of the im
portance of , the primary - election.
, Two sessions of 'the -league 7 yesterday
were. devoted, to ' negotiations ' to bring
about harmonious action of all the'anti
boss elements - of the - pany. Friends of
the league entertain the hope that careful
consideration Â« will-, be { given to so-called
offers of â¢, compromise. Â» â¢ It â¢ is yet fresh in
the minds ofithe people of San Francisco
that< an. 'organization ; formed^ two â¢ years
aigo under the banner of clean politics and
anti-boss rule- became so 'badly, infected
with' Phelanism ; that Horace Davis, the-
Republican â¢ nominee for Mayor, .was be

ramento Record-Union Is for sale, Mr.
Hays said, after! a pause of some length,
and then the- colored porter poked his
head in- at the door" of the car, and an
nounced that Oakland had been reached.
Coming over on the ferry-boat President
Hays gave out a few facts about the fu
ture policy of the road, but in reference
to changes in the personnel of his staff
he parried all questions with the ease, of
a diplomat:' He says with the appointment
of J. C. Stubbs as traffic director of the
Union Pacific, Southern Pacific,, Oregon
Short Line and O. R. and N. roads greater
results can be achieved; that the consoli
dation of these roads does not mean that
expenses will be cut and that Improve
ments will .be- stopped, but that the bet
terment of the roads is assured.
The project" of shortening the road of
the- Central .Pacific and straightening the
curves over the mountains Hays said will
be acted upon by the executive board of
the Southern Pacific, of which Mr. Harri
mau Is chairman. - ; Business of great im
portance has so far occupied the time^of
the board, but he expects that the matter
jWill.be taken up very shortly and that the
work will then be pushed with vim.
' He also said he thought- the traffic be
tween Â¦ San Francisco and San 1 Jose i war
ranted a double track; that work on the
bay;shore cut-off would be. commenced in
the fall, as the right of way had been se
cured. .The application to operate this
new road'in the Mission would be brought
up before j the . Board of â¢ Supervisors -in"
October and no opposition from that body
is anticipated.' . .;â Â¦Â¦.-"Â¦;,-, \ ;.â¢Â¦

across the bay President Hays, with \evi

Ex-Senator Earl of Alameda Aspires
to Fame in Congressâ Postmasters .
-. of Oakland and San Francisco. .-'
Several members of the -California Con
gressional delegation, the Governor, of the
State, United States Senator Perkins and
i legion '. of leading Republicans -believe
fiat General W. H. L. Barnes should be
appointed United States Minister to Ja
pan: Before- the general was mentioned
for the | position Senator,- Bard indorsed
Dr. Chester Rowell of Fresno for the place
and obtained from the -senior Senator, a
promise to second the indorsement. Sen
ator Perkins Is therefore committed to
the support of Dr. Rowell, but he is not
unmindful of the fact that President Mc-
Kinley. and any number of leading-citi
zens of the State entertain the highest re
gard for^ General Barnes. and. recognize
that he possesses the ability and educa
tion to serve his country in high station.
If Senator Bard insists on the fulfillment
of the agreement in respect to the Rowell
recommendationvthe Senators will ask the
President to appoint' Dr. Rowell. V .
It* is the' judgment of well-informed pub
lic, men,, in "view of this condition^ that
the President will give the Japanese mis
sion to a leading man of some State other
than California and tender to General
Barnes a mission to Europe.
When : Benjamin Harrison was elected
President a strong sentiment existed in
favor, of a. Californian for.; the Cabinet.
The President favored John F. Swift, but
the Congressmen and , members of the
Legislature indorsed M.M. Estee. Presi
dent Harrison did. not appoint either to
the Cabinet, but he at once appointed Mr.
Swift Minister to Japan.
Candidates for Congress.
One of Alameda County's favorite sons,
ex-Senator Guy C. Earl, is said to be am
bitious for fame in Congress.- So violent
Is the fever of ambition : that , he is.seri
ously considering the suggestion to enter
the race against Victor.H.-Metcalf for the
Republican nomination : in the Oakland
District. The ex-Senator.ls rich as -well
as aspiring. Recent sale of his holdings
in the Earl Fruit Company placed ready
cash at his command, and cash properly
placed in fields of political strife may in
spire a deal of legitimate enthusiasm in a
community . and Â¦ sometimes - secure . a few
votes in a convention. Color is given to
the story of Mr. Earl's aspiration by the
fadt that he has volunteered his legal ser
vices in behalf of the people in a contest
wherein" the - Contra Costa Water Com
pany is seeking to compel Auditor Breed
to audit certain bills of the water corpor
ation. In the light of rumors that Judge
Henshaw is ready to enter the fight for
the United States Senatorship, and that
Mr. Earl is looking. for* an opening in the
lower . house of Congress, George C. v Per
kins and Victor H. Metcalf should hasten,
to Inspect their. own political fences. -
Oakland is a Â¦ progressive community,
and progress signifies change. A new
Postmaster will represent* one of the im
pending changes: If Senator Perkins
were minded to - grasp all the patronage
within his reach he might' name the new
Postmaster, but" he has surrendered his

GARCELON
TRUST SUIT
IS DECIDED
Judge Sloss Renders* an
Important Opinion
/ in the Case/,
.Â¦,-'" y >
Account of Bate Trustee Is
Finally Passed Upon
and Filed.
â¢
A Million Dollars to Be Divided Be
tween Bowdoin College and Mer
â¢ ritt Hospital of Oakland.
By a decision, rendered yesterday by
Superior Judge Sloss, the settlement of
an account of .the trustees under the.
famous Garcelon trust was effected and
the sum of nearly one million dollars will
now be divided between the Merritt Hos
pital of Oakland and the - Bowdoin Col
lege. The decision was reached in the ac
tion instituted by T. B. Coghill and C. D.
Allen, as executors of .the will of the late
Judge John A. Stanly, against Henry
Rogers as trustee of the trust created. by
Catherine M. Garcelon, and in the matter
of the" application of the president and
trustees of Bowdoin College for the^ap
pointment of a trustee for the . Garcelon
trust. . .
On April 21. 1S91, Mrs. Garcelon executed
a trust deed on certain property in which
the Bowdoin College and the Merritt Hos
pital of Oakland were named as . benc
nciaries. â¢ -' . Â¦'.:'
Judge Stanly was one of the trustees j
of the. Garcelorf trust, and for a number j
of years he defended the many suits j
brought for the purpose of declaring the i
trust invalid. Bowdoin College was to re- j
celve - lour-tqntns of the property named i
in the trust dÂ«ed and the Merritt Hoe- J
pital was to receive six-tenths of the I
property. - ! I
1 ne beneficiaries mentioned in the trust
deed agreed that Judge Stanley should re
ceive compensation- for his services as
trustee of the trust and the sum of $MK)
per racnth was agreed upon.
When Judge Stanly <Jied, on September
22, lbVJ, an application was made to the j
couris for the iippointment of his succes
sor, and Henry Jrtogers became trustee of
the Garcelon crust.
The complaint filed by Judge Stanly's
executors set forth that Stanly was
trustee for many years of the Garcelon
trust and that his accounts had never I
been formally allowed by the courts. The j
bulky statement of the accounts shows i
that Judge Stanly, during his administra- I
tion. handled nearly two million dollars'
worth of propsrty. real and personal, be
longing: to the Garcelon trust. Included
in the statement of accounts was tue Item j
162,000, charged by Judge Stanly as pay
ment for his services, under the contract
with the beneficiaries.
Henrv Rogers, in answering the com
plaint, admitted that the accounts were
true and correct with the exception of the
item for $62,000 for services, claiming that*
the contract entered into between Judge
Stanly and the beneficiaries was inform
ally made and, therefore, not legal.
For this reason Henry Rogers presented
a claim for $62,000 Â£gainst the estate of
the late Judge Stanly, though at the same
time it was conceeded that the I contract
between Stanly and the beneficiaries had
been recognized by all parties during
Etanly's lifetime.
A number of attorneys were engaged in
the litigation, Henry W. Bradley and J.
C. McKlnstry appearing for the Stanly
estate, and A. Muenter for the present
trustee of the Garcelon trust.
In a manner entirely satisfactory to all
parties. It was agreed that the Stanly
estate should pay the sum of $6500 by
way of luirp settlement to Henry ilogers,
trustee of the Garcelon trust, in settle
ment of the claim for HZ.QJO. The settle
ment was made with the distinct under
standing that t.Â»Â»e sum of $6500 had no
reference to an;,' specific Stam, but that tne
Slanly executors allowed the amount in
full settlement of every claim made by
the Garcelon trustee and the beneiiciaries
cf the trust deed.
Judge Sloss, in rendering his decision,
stated that the compensation received- by
Judge Stanly was reasonable, proper and
legitimate and was a proper charge
against the trust fund, and that all parties
having agreed on a friendly settlement as
regards the claim of $62,000, mentioned
above, he ordered the approval and allow
ance of the statement of accounts and of
the compromise between the Stanly
executors and the beneficiaries of the
Garcelon trust.
