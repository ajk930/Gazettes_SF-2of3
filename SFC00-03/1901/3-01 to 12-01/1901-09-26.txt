The yacht Columbia, which success
fully defended the America's cup in ISP3
aralnst Sir Thomas Upton's challenger,
th* Shamrock I, ha* been again chosen
to rac* against this year's challenger,
the Shamrock II. A syndicate of a few
members of the New Vork Yacht Club
> a4 built a new yacht, the Constitution,
to defend the trophy, but she behaved
fo varisbly in the trial races with the
Columbia that it was decided by her
owners to reject HerreshofTs latest crea
tion fn favor of his lÂ£ft boat, the qual
ttJcat of which are well known. The, syn
dicate had promised the. designer a >arge
bonus tor every minute of higher Hpec-d
over a thirty-mil* course that the Con
stitution might display and HerreshoflT
felt confident he had designed a faster
boat than the. Columbia. And when she
liar b*ert thoroughly tuned up It Is quite
probable that she will prove able to best
the Columbia in any kind of weather/ as
eh* has already done In light brerzes.
Hut ah time was lacking to get her sails
tnd csIUst Â« xuotly trimmed and to ren
der hÂ»-r capÂ«blfe of h<r best work the syn*
dicate wisely determined to* entrust the
defence of the cup io the Columbia.

Opinions as to the Weather.
Those whose convictions He the other
way assert that G. L. Watson, the de
signer of tbe chalkncr, has at last out
done Herr^shcff in building a racer pure
and simple, and that this clean-lined craft
will take a lot of beating before she sur
renders her right to add a certain -cov
eted bit of silver to her ballast. On all
zides it is conceded that these two are
very evenly matched, but experts widely
differ aÂ« to the kind of weather that Is
best suited to Â»,-ach. One will argue that
the challenger, by reason of her greater
enow of canvas and extreme refinement of
tKXiv. should be. more formidable In light
breeies. The** predict that If the weather
is light enough to waft the yachts over
the. coarse Just within the time limit the
challenger will be more than apt to take
away the cup. Others, are equally confi
dent that the challenger's best point of
sailing will be shown in a spanking breeze
of wind and that, given such a wind, she
will r how extraordinary running and
reaching qualities.
Meanwhile the Columbia's adherents
thow the eame vast diversity of opinion,
rome whistling for a wind and others be
lieving that their favorite will show bet
ter In lltrht weather.
NEW TORK. Sept. I5.-BleÂ«sed |
by a breeze that is brisk. If
prophets of the weather err
not. with hulls gleaming like
mirrors, neat fitting canvas
stretched taut and tit for the
coming fray. America's tried defend
er, the Columbia, and Briton's bold chal
lenger the Shamrock 11. will do battle
royal off Sandy Hook to-morrow lor the j
America's cup. Vnless all signs fall, there !
will be glorious sport when the old Co
lumbia goes out to meet the now cham
pion from over the seas. Eager thou
cands will watch the strupplo. for not in
year* has there been so much interest in
an international yacht race. In some of
in* previous contests it was almost a
foregone conclusion that the cup would
remain where it has sojourned so long,
and since it was sure to stay why bother
to go out and see the manner in which
the efforts to retrieve it would be fended
There Is no such fine conceit apparent
now; there is on the contrary something
more than a shade of concern among
those interested in keeping the cup on
this side of the Atlantic. Fqr even the
most enthusiastic admirers of the Bristol
racer are not sure but that Herreshoff
reached his limit in the Columbia and
that to* new challenger, being of a later
model, may also be faster than the old
defender, all of which remains to bÂ« seen.
Bettors Favor the Columbia.
It looks as though one of the biggest
excursion f.eets.that ever went afloat will
be there to see it. Not the least of the
rpectacular features promised for the day
Is tbe expected parade of an exception-
Vnlly large number of yachts. *8{} t i^fr** n '5

here are many who believe that the cup
..;Â¦'Â¦.'* rtlll in *afe keeping is shown- by the
â¢ ritirgl odds of 10 to S being to-day
â¢V ".real on the Columbia"* chances. Men
'.â¢â> are. willing to risk their money on
Â¦Â¦; he Columbia do not base their odds on
Â¦ .^ntimental reasons or on the mere hope
that the vessel's successful defense of the
* cup two years ago will be repeated in this
year of grace. They argue that as the
Shamrock . II has beaten Shamrock I by
nine minutes over a thirty-mile course,
the Columbia in defeating the same ves
sel by a ten-minute margin should now
Â¦defeat the newer boat by a still greater
. margin, particularly as she is now known
to be tuned up to the finest point, and
Judging by pan experience should be
several minutes faster than she was two
years aro
In Sandy Hook. Outside a heavy sea
was running and sailing vessels were
bounding along under close reefed sails.
While the wind died away with the sun
set the weather-wise say It* will come
again with the morning and that all In
dications are favorable for one of tho
most magnificent spectacles in yachting
annals when the two flyers go over the
line to-morrow.
Columbia Has a Trial.
At 2 o'clock to-day when the wind had
fallen the Columbia started out for *
trial. She filled away under mainsail,
club topsail, staysail and Jib. At 2:17.
while men trimmed down the main sheet,
others set a No. 2 Jib topsail. The main
sail and club topsail *ei nicely, but the
headsalls showed, a few minor faults in
the leach and fee!.. Tacking to port at
2:02, when she had reached the north
\lÂ«le of the main ship channel, the cup
defender stood out to sea. In this nar
row' chrnnel, however, she was forced
to tack again iu six minutes. The wind
was very light and there was quite an
ugly swell rolling- in from the eastward
which knocked the wind out of her sails.
From here out to the black btoy at the
entrance to Gedneys Channel, where sno
turned around for the home run at 3:13.
the Columbia was forced to make thir
teen tacks to cover a scant three mile*,
so that it may be easily seen she was
not able to show any speed during tne
spin, especially as the wind was very
light and* baffling. -M '
Â» Batt:n Pocket Torn.
When the sheets were eased for the run
back to the Hook the yacht showed somo
of ,hÂ«r old-time speed. .The small Jib top
ratf-was Â¦ taken tn: "sixteen" nvn then
manned the balloon jib topsail halyards,
and in three mlnutea that sail was set
and drawing well. In hauling aft the
sheet it caught on the ends of one of the
battens of the Jib and tore the batten
pocket about a foot. It can easily be re
paired, however. â¢
Gybing out at 3:22 the yacht made her
way slowly to the point of Sandy Hook.
Rounding to there she ran quickly to her
buoy and made fast for the night, the
whole run lasting less than two hours. .-
After a consultation with | Manager
Jameson and Designer Watson. Sir Thom
as Llpton directed that it was not neces
sary to take the Shamrock out for a final
spin. She lay moored at her buoy all
day. her shining bronze body, being, the
object of much curiosity; â¢ . .'.,,
Sir Thomas Is Fleassd.
. When Sir Thomas was told to-day that
as u' result of the official measurement of |
the yachts the Shamrock would have to
allow the Columbia only forty-three sec
onds in a thirty-mile course he was much
pleased. - ' â¢ Â» Â¦" ' ' : - '
â¢;Don't you think we hare a splendid
chance to win now?" he remarked. "Wo:,
fully expected to have to allow more time,
but. of course, we are very well satisfied
with the result. And. again I say. may
the best boat win. If the .Shamrock
should lose I can certainly say that I
have done everything- a man could do to
put the yacht In perfect condition for the
race?, and I think every one admits that
she is as nearly perfect as she can be." Â¦ -
The crews of the racers worked busily
to-day putting the* finishing touches on
the two yachts. To-night the Shamrock
and the Columbia He within hailing dis-
tance of each other, swinging at. their
moorings to a good breese. In' which lies
the hopes of to-morrow's races. . All has
been done that skill and experience can/
suggest, and none of the principals win^
make a prophecy as to the outcome. Only
the betting shows the trend of opinion,
and the prevailing odds are S to 10 on the
American boat. In some instances these:
odds had been Increased from 10 to 7. -but;
so far as can be learned no large wagers.
have been laid. A firm of brokers was ;
to-day offering $2,000 or any parf thereof '
at 10 to 8. but had been unable to place
more than a small part of this amount.;

NEW YORK. SÂ«>pt. 25.â A special to the
Sun from New Haven. Conn., says: Presi
dent Hadleyfif Yale was asked last night:
"Under what circumstances did you con
sent to contribute to the New York* Jour
nal'* labor symposium?"
President Hadley replied:
"Deception Is one of the characteristics
of yellow journalism. Its most notorious
representative yesterday published what
purported to be a contribution by me. to
â¢Our Labor Symposium.' I don't care to
get lnaj any controversy bn the subject.
All I care to say about ft Is practically
covered In the statement* that appeared
In the New Y.ork Evening Post on Mon
day."
This statement was: â¢;
"It seemed to us so tncredlble that.Pres
ident Hadley .should have become a con
tributor to the New York Journal that we
determined to learn the facts In the mat
ter, and we are ennbled to state that they
are these: Some time ago he received a
request for authentic copies of some of his '
utterances which might fairly be quoted
as expressing his views on questions of
industrial combinations, and he sent such
copies. Soon after he found his name ad
vertised ns a contributor to the Journal.
He at ome wrote to his correspondent
that he had authorized the use of these
things only for quotation; and not as-orig
inal matter, and that he should hold him
responsible for peeing that It should be
made plain that it was not a contribution
to the Journal."
The same contribution' "by- Arthur G.
Hadley" was published in the Examiner
September 3 on page S. â¢
NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â A Sun special
from Baltimore. Md.. says: Cardinal
Gibbons said to-day that he has not given
anything lately to the New York Journal,
and If anything has been published In that
paper it must have'been from an old ser
mon or something that he had said. some
time ago.
"1 do not care to make any statement."

Judge Advocate I<emly then asked:
Admiral Cotton detailed the' conversa
tion he had with. Schley Immediately be
fore the retrograde movement, and said
â¢that, Schley ordered him to proceed to
'Klngstori with the Harvard. *v while the
squadron started for Key west. :
. Mr. Raynor called attention to the fact
that there. were some material changes In
the dispatch^ as printed in the official re
ports by the Navy Department.
â¢ Admiral Schlcy'g dispatch dated May 29'.
In which .he aald he could not obey the
orders of the department, was then read,
and Ma Raynor pointed out various
changes In 'the language of the dispatch
as. printed In the original report.
â¢ Admiral Cotton then related a conversa
tion he had had with Admiral Schley con
cerning a proposition of Lieutenant Beall
of the Harvard to go ashore and put hlm
selfln- communication with the Cuban in
Â»urgents.- He could not, he said, recall
the exact words of the conversation, but
at all events Mr. Beall had not been
ordered ashore.
Cotton's Talk to Schley.
.'Admiral Cotton testified that ho had
gons aboard Admiral' 8chley's flagship,
the Brooklyn, on that date to take dis
patches to him. and ho nald at flriit that
he save him four or Hve dispatches ad
dressed to the commander of the squad
ron. .He afterward, modified tht* state
ment, naylne that probably nil but two
of these dispatches were addressed to
himself (Admiral Cotton), but they con
tained information which he - thought
should be In Admiral Schley's possession.
One of these was a copy of a dispatch
from Admiral Sampson which â¢ had not
been printed In the official records, stating
that the Spanish fleet was at- Santiago.
He also said that the coal could have been
taken from the Merrlmac on the 27th of
May, the day on which the retrograde
movement to the west was begun for the
purpose of coaling. . , -
.. WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.â Two new wlt
ncBaei were Introduced In the Schley
court to-day. They were Admiral Cotton,
who an cttptoln commanded the auxiliary
cruiser Harvard) and. Captain Wise, who
commanded tho; auxiliary cruiser Yale
during the. Spanish war. Br.th these ves
sels were used as scouts, and both cams
up with 'the flying squadron off Santiago
on the 27th of May, before the. retrograde
movement to Kfty West Was begun. .. .

ous American yachts had crossed the
ocean and with varying success.
The first challenge for the America's
cup came In 1870 from James Ashbury of
the Royal Thames Yacht Club, owner of
the schooner Cambria. The challenge was
accepted, and In â¢ the race that followed
there were fifteen starters.' The Cambria,
as a matter of . courtesy, was given the
windward berth, but a shift of wind at
the crucial moment deprived her of the
chance of winning. The Magic, a little
center-board schooner, won and was fol
lowed across the line by the Idler. Sllvie
and the original winner of the cup.
Undlscouraged by . this defeat Mr..Ash
bury constructed another schooner, the
Livonia; and Issued a second challenge In
1S71; The â¢ Dauntless Â¦ and Sappho, keel
schooners, and the Columbia and Palmer,
center-board schooners, were selected .by
the New York - Yacht Club to de
fend the cup. The race was sailed
outside of Sandy Hook, instead - of
over â¢ the club course on New York Bay.'
The Columbia won the first two races,
but eras defeated In the third. The Sappho
proved victorious In the fourth and fifth,
so the final two races were not sailed.
The third challenge was entered In 1876
by the Royal Canadian Yacht Club of To
ronto, Canada, the club's representative
being the center-board schooner Countess
of Duffertn. The schooner Madeline,
which was selected to defend the trophy,
won easily both racesâ the first in eleven'
minutes and the second in twenty-seven
minutes, a This race ; is notable : as being
the ' first contest In which America .was
represented by, a single boat. The Count

these shores. Later it was placed In the
custody of the New York Yacht Club; and
since then has been competed for at Ir
regular Intervals. In each Instance, all
the elements embraced In a yacht race
have seemed to favor the retention of
the cup as a perpetual challenge trophy
In tho hands of its present proprietors.
Financially of but slight value, there is
a glamour and a romance about that cup,
engendered by national pride, that makes
It worth more than Its weight In gold. 'In
fact, were one to reckon In dollars and
cents the amount of money expended di

on these shores, the figures would assume

Before the advent of the yacht America
In British waters, the International cup
now being contested for by the Shamrock
II and the Columbia- was a j prise i given
annually by the Royal Yacht Squadron,
for a race around the Isle of Wight, open
to all nations. Â¦ It was, however, several
years after America had captured Â¦ the
cup that defenders , were invited to test
maritime supremacy In the waters df the
country In whose possession was the cup.
This happy idea,' which' adds i so "much

Attempts to "lift the cup" have been

the time of the first competition In Brit

build and design of the competing vessels.
The America was an Inspiration to Brit

The Royal Clyde Yacht Club of Glas
gow wns the next to come forward as a
bidder for the trophy. This club based Its
hopes on the Thistle, which was designed
by O. L. Watson, the most noted of Brit
ish designers. The defender, named the
Volunteer,' an enlarged Â¦ and materially
Improved Mayflower with a steel - hull,
defeated the Thistle by eleven minutes.
To meet the Valkyrie II In 1892 the Vigi
lant was designed and built by the Her
reshoff Company. The new defender
proved to be far superior to all the boats
entered in the trial races and In the con
test with the Valkyrie she won the final
race by forty minutes in one of the most
exciting races ever held for the American
trophy. -'
After a year's Interval the British again
challenged with a third Valkyrie, and the
contest - which followed. In which '. the
America's cup was defended by *the De
fender, resulted in a wrangle growing out
of a collision between the boats.
The, next challenge came In the fall of
1898 from Sir. Thomas Upton, a member
of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club, of Ban
gor. Ireland, his yacht being the* Sham
rock, which proved In all ' respects to be
a great racing machine. She was especial

withstanding her good . qualities, the
Shamrock was defeated In every race by

Before another challenge for the Ameri
ca s cup was received three years elapsed,
during which time great chances were in
augurated In the construction of yachts,
but these changes, however, did not pre
vent the American designed and built
yacht to triumph In the fifth contest. This
match was sailed between the Puritan,
constructed by Lawley & Son of South
Boston, and the Oenesta, owned by Sir
Richard 8utton of the Royal Yacht
Squadron. Three attempts were made to
sail the first race, over the outside course.
beginning on September 7. but two of
these failed because of calm weather, and
In the third the Puritan fouled the Ge
nesta before crossing the starting line.
The first race . was therefore sailed over
the Inside course on September 14, in light
weather, the Puritan winning with ease.
The final race was sailed two days later,
and although It resulted In a victory for
the American boat the Genesta made a
maerniflcent showing and was only beaten
by 1 minute and 38 seconds. It was dur
ing this race that, for the first time, the
national Interest and pride in the achieve
ments of the American boat were thor
oughly aroused.
The match In 1SS6 proved but a repeti
tion of the preceding contest. The Gala
tea. property of Lieutenant 'William
Hernn, R. N., of the Royal Northern
Yacht Club, was similar to the Genesta

crew if the Shamrock JI "lifts the cup."
The races will go on until either chal
lenger or defender has won a majority
out of five, the coume being ihirty miles
in length, and the yachts sailing either
fifteen miles to leeward or windward and
return, or over a triangular course, ten
miles to a leg. The course will be strlct
: ly preserved from the intrusion of excur
1 e'on steamers or tugs. All the prellmln
: arles have been amicably settled between
the representatives of Sir Thomas Lip
ton and the challenge committee of the
New York Yacht Club. He would be a
rash man who would venture to predict
the result, for though the Columbia Is
known to be faster than she 'was In 1893,
when she defeated the Shamrock I, the
challenger of 1901 in believed to be con
siderably faster than the Shamrock I.
The question now almost -universally
anked and soon to receive a reply Is "How
much faster 1s II than I?' 1
The Shamrock II in said to be. an exag
gerated Columbia, and it is thought that
tbie fact, together with her light After
body, will make her easy to driw, and
zi\'e her an adt'antage in light breezes.
Many American experts, while frankly
admitting that she is the most dangerous
yacht that has *ver challenged for the
America's cup, think that she dooe not
ehow power enough for hÂ«;r size, and that
when heeled over on a reach she will

which she was bui.'t is to be fashioned
into a monument.
Cost Enormous Sums.
Larg? racing yachts cost such enormous
sums or money because the most highly
paid workmen and .the best materials are
employed in their construction. The
great object of the designer and builder
is to combine strength with lightness, so
that the hull may be. able to carry an
enormous spread of canvas and yet offer
a- little resistance as possible to the
water. Speaking in general terms the
lighter the boat, the longer her floor and
ihi greater her sail area the speedier she
will be. Now steel is a very strong
nunal. but a certain amount of rust is
necessary to take off the scale which is
found on newly rolled steel and leave
a smooth surface for copper paint. Alum
inum i5 light and at least half as strong
as steel, but it rapidly corrodes and de
teriorates. So both eteel and aluminum
have been rejected in favor of Tobin
bronze, which is an alloy somewhat re
sembling gun metal. It costs about ten
times a* much as steel, but it is not
affected by the tea water and needs no
anti-fouling paint. The plates of which
the hull of the Columbia is made vary
from three-sixteenths to one-quarter of
an inch in thickness and are polished
outside until they shine like .a copper
saucepan and slip through the water
with scarcely any friction.
Boats Built for Speed.
The Columbia's bronze hull is a little
more than 131 feet long and U feet wide,
but is cut away fore and aft so that her
water tine measurement is about 90 feet:
her overhangs thus amounting to *l feet.
The hull is strengthened with nickel-
Eteel frames placed where the strains
come. Its weight is about seventy tons,
yet It is so cleverly constructed that it
holds up a great leaden tin weighing
more than ninety tons, besides support
ing some fifteen tons more of rlsging.
spars, canvas and sailors. The deck of
yellow pine is almost the only wooden
part of the yacht. The mast is of steel,
hollow and braced with angle Irons. It
supports a topmast sixty-four feet long,
and the highest point of the club of the
bip club topsail is 175 feet above the sur
face of the water. The main boom is also
of hollow steel, nearly 110 feet long, and
the entire spread of canvas is about 15.000
square feet â enough to supply a complete
suit cf sails for a full-rigged ship. In
addition to her steel mainmast the Co
lumbia has a mast of Oregon spruce, to
be used in case of an accident to the
steel one. It weighs nearly a ton more
than the steel spar. The rigging and
'halyards are made of wire rope, the hal
yards having Manila ropes at the ends,
â¢jseri for hauling.
All the sails, except two of the light
weather sails, are made of cotton duck of
the best quality, the spinnaker and bal
loon jib topsail being of balloon cloth, a
Â£ne cotton fabric impervious to air.
Construction of Challenger.
The Shamrock II. the challenger, was
designed by G. L. Watson, the celebrated
Scotch naval architect, and built by the
Denny Brothers of the Leven shipyard at
Dumbarton. She presents on a first view
an impression of great beam and a. shal
low bedy. with long overhangs forward
and aft. The forward overhang is carried
Sown in -beautiful curves, merging grad
ually anci sracefully Into the hull and
underbody. She seem? to have been de
signed with the idea of skimming over the
wa;Â«?r. and of earning her head well up,
BO matter how hard she may be driven.
The midship section shows very easy
curves, and on deck the challenger tapers
from the point of greatest beam In long
lines until at the after end of her counter
she has a breadth of only nine feet. As
regards her lead :in. the fin plating and
sole were first riveted on, and then about
ninety-five tons of melted lead were run
into the mold thus formed, the exact
trim being seeured afterward by adding
pies of lead. The plating of which her
hull is constructed Is of a bronze known
as 'Immadium,' and has been most in
eeciously fitted. The deck Is of light
steel covered with yellow pine . which af
fords the sailors a better foothold than
metal would. Th- mast, boom and gaff
are of light steel plates rolled In a semi
f-ylindrica! lorcn. double riveted and
strengthened inside. The topgallant fcon
trary w the usual practice of Britisn
yatnt*m*n) will be housed telescoplcally
inside the. mainmast- The main boom I*
the longest ever used on board a racing
yacht, being 112 feet long from gooseneck
to outhaul. The bowsprit is twenty-five
feet long, and will carry a shorter head
sail than the Shamrock 1. Critics think
that the extra power derived from the
mainsail should make the Shamrock II ;
very fast In windward work, though it
tray tell against her speed when the wind
Is abaft the beam, an a smaller spinnaker
will then <lt is thought) be necessary.
The Shamrock II's spinnaker boom is the
largest and longest hollow spar ever car
ried, but is also considerably lighter than \
any epar used by any previous cup racer. |

LOS ANGELES COMES
TO PLAT THE HOME NINE
â¢Til bet that fellow's grandfather could
throw, a cocoanut thirty miles," was the
laconic j comment of a spectator yester
day at Joe Walcott' s training quarters
over at Larkspur. The remark was
brought out by the abnormal, gorilla-like
development of Walcott's arms and shoul
ders. These are of the most wonderful
construction. In size they are greater
than those of many heavy-weights and
when the little colored boxer is in action
they are as frlctionless as the engines of
the Oregon. In addition to the tremendous
driving power of his arms and shoulders
there is a remarkable flexibility which
permits Walcott to hit from any position
In which he may find himself.
His most distinguished visitor yesterday
was "Tom O'Rourke, his manager. The
latter was pleased with Walcott's condi
tion and advised his friends to have a bet
down on the colored wonder. His advice
must have been followed, as the betting
on Walcott picked up a point, going from
7 to 10 on Tuesday to b to 10 yesterday.
It is expected the betting will be at evens
when tne- rival middle-weights enter the
ring at Mechanics' Pavilion to-morrow
night.
Gardner's condition Is pleasing his ad
mirers, who cannot see how he can lose.
He is doing a lot of road work and build
ing up his vitality to wltflstand the blows
Walcott will aim at him. Behind Gardner
will be Aleck Greggains, Dave Barry and
Charley Thurston. Walcott will have the
services of O'Rourke, John Herget, Gus
Herget and Henry Lewis.
Jack Welsh, official referee of the San
Francisco Club, will be the third man in
the ring.
Herrera Defeats Mowatt.
MADERA, Sept. 25.â Young Mowatt,
who came from Chicago to meet the Ba
kersflcld boxer, Herrera, was defeated In
the second round to-day at the Amphi
theater. In the first half of the second
round Herrera knocked Mowatt down. In
falling Mowatt sprained bis left ankle
badly, and when he arose he could hardly
stand. He was groggy and Herrera
rushed him again, knocking him to the
floor. Mowatt was game and got up eight
times, only to be knocked down. Keferee
J. G. Roberts declared Herrera the win
ner. Mowatt was carried out of the ring.
His ankle Is in bad condition.
The preliminary between Kid McFadden
and Tom Herman was declared a draw.
' NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â The athletes of
Tale and Harvard met the athletic repre
sentatives of Oxford and Cambridge uni
versities to-day at Berkeley oval In track
and field events. As was expected, tha
brawn and muscle of the American col
legians proved too much for the visitors.
the Americana winning six -out of the nine
events on the programme. Points were
counted for wins only, so that the Har
vard and Yale men defeated their Eng
lish opponents by a score of six points to
three. :
Between the American universities hon
ors were equally divided. Harvard and
Yale winning three events. The Oxford
representatives failed to gain a point for
the visiting team, the light blue of Cam
bridge being In front in all three con
tests won by the .Englishmen.
The greatest and closest contest of the <
day was the 129-yard hurdle race. Gar
nler of Oxford and Converse of Harvard
had the Issue between them, from tha
crack of the pistol. Up to the eighth
hurdle they were abreast, several yards in
front of Allcock of Cambridge and Clapi>
of Yale. Going over the last hurdle Con
verse gained a couple of Inches, and as htÂ»
reached the tape the Harvard man was
barely six Inches- in front of Gamier, the
time being 15 3-5 seconds.
Hargrave of Yale made a superhuman
effort toward the finish of the 100-yard
dash, which he won in. 10 2-5 seconds.
Haigbt of Harvard led for nearly fifty
yards, when be was passed by Hind of
Cambridge. Hargrave was equal to the
occasion, and with a wonderful spurt as
sumed the lead and won by a yard.
Workman won the . half-mile handily,
with Cleve of Oxford second. In 1:55 3-5.
Rust of Harvard won the quarter-mile
run in 50 seconds, with Boardman of Yale
his closest attendant, the Englishmen be
ing unable to get on even terms with the
leaders at any time.
In the one-mile run Cawthra, Cockshott
and Gregson, all of Cambridge, made the
running. So far as the American runners
were concerned, they never had a phost
of a show, as Cockshott won easily, wnila
Gregson, his clubmate, finished five yards
In front of Knowles. Â¦
In the field events the Americans had it
ail their own way.

Most cf the horses, as well as riders,
which participated In the meeting acroe*
the bay will leave for Los Angeles to
nigct. The meet In the southern city
promises to be the greatest In the history
of racing there.
ThÂ« large crawd of racegoers that at
tended the dosing day of the Golden Gate
meeting at OaKland track yesterday was
rewarded by witnessing some splendid
sport. Nothln? prettier nor more excit
ing In the race horse line could be de
sired from a sj>ectacular standpoint than
the four-cornered selling event, fifth on
the card. From the start almost a blank
et would have covered the quartet, Ruiz
flnally landing Sir Dougal, the outsider,
lirst. a nose ahead of the favorite. Sir
Hampton, piloted by J. Matthews. Rey
Dare fell out oi It when tho pinch came.
Rollick ran a close third. The latter
pulled up lame.
Al Sandy, winner of the harness event,
and Saul cf Tarsus were the only success
ful favorites. At that. Master Cal, Frank
Duffy. Huachuca and Cousin Carrie were
well backed, and the bookies did not put
Id a prosperous day.
There was no apparent glimmer of a
struggle in the harness number. Al San
dy, a 1 to S chance, driven by J. O'Kane,
woo in straight heats. Lena Holly took
second and Bobby J third money.
J. Matthews celebrated his California
debut by reaching the wire first on Mas
ter Cal, the Â«econd choice, in the seven
furlong selling affair. Pegalong, the fa
vorite, ran unplaced, with Senator Matts
beating Pongo for the place.
Tullett oil Duckoy, favorite for the Fu
turity course sprint following, did not fin
ish among the tirst three. Frank Duffy,
well ridden by Eansch. beat Billy Moore
out a neck at 3dds of 2 to 1.
04 off soon alter the start. Royalty
lost the two-year-old scramble to Hua
chuca. Hoar rode the winner, which wae
a â¬ to 5 second choice*
In fine form at present, Saul of Tarsus
made all the running in the sixth number,
downing Mike Strauss a half-length. The
winner closed an even money chance.
Cousin Carrie, a 7 to 1 shot, led out Lou
Clieveden and the favorite. McNamara,
in the final sprint. Gold Baron led to the
stretch, where he quit. Summary:

harness from James Delaney. His arrest
was made by Constable Allen. Suesser
obtained his -release and then started to
wreak vengeance upon Delaney and Al
ton. Going to tho Dclanoy house he asked
for admission, and when he was refused
flred four shots through the door. 1 Then
he set flre to 'a haystack. Constable Al
len had heard of his threats to kill De
laney, and coming up found Suesser near
the stack. Suesser ran and Allen pursued
him. .
SAN JOSE. Sept. 25.-The taking of tes

Father and sister 'of the dead Sheriff were
present, as were a couple of Suesser's sis
ters. The prisoner Is being closely watched
and a deputy thcrltt besides the regular

YOU HAVE SCIATICA, ;
"This grindinjf, Knawintr pain is what is called Sciatic Rheumatism. *
I call it plain 'Sciatica' because it is a weak, irritated condition of the !
Sciatic nerve, which runs from your hip joint down through the back of '
your thigh.
"There are several causes for it; exposure to dampness, heavy work \
on your legs, leading a fast life, or general weakness. The nerve is cry- <

The friends of Auditor Wells assert
that their candidate will win out. They
contend thnt the independents cannot
muster votes enough to swing the con
vention away from Wells.
The audden development of a vigorous
contest over the Mayoralty nomination
upsets many of the plans pertaining to
the selection of candidates for Hherlflf,
Auditor, County Clerk. Recorder and Tax
Collector. The programme which con
templates the selection of Auditor Wells
for Mayor is directly connected with a
plan to nominate Bert Mahony for Coun
ty Clerk and give the nomination for
Auditor to W. A. Deane. It transpires
that the fortieth District delegation of
twenty-eight votes Is firm in the demand
that Harry Baehr shall have something.
Rumors were rife last evening that Mr.
liaehr would be put on one of the slates
for Auditor.
John Laekmnjin is not to have a walk

to be closely observed by the forces, of
T^aumeister and Wells. The fight is so
clone that the Forty-first Is In position to
determine the result. The delegation has

to the extent of forcing the withdrawal
of Wells and the Introduction of another
candidate to defeat Laumelnttr. ' It was
common gossip late last night that the
I^iumnlnter forces would oppose delay in
mnkins nominations..

Bo decided Judge Troutt yesterday, after
he had dismissed 'the contempt-proceed

When Coleman was divorced from his
wife the custody of the child was given
to the mother, with the understanding
that in tho event of, a second marriage
the child should ro to the father A week
after the divorce was granted Mm. Cole
man hurried to Reno and became Mrs.
Smith. Coleman Immediately applied for
the custody of the child, claiming that .is
his ex-wife had chosen another husband

Troutt, however,' held that the Reno mar
riage was not legal, and therefore she wan
not a wife. He ordered the child sent to
a convent and made a further order that
Coleman b* permitted to 'see her three
times a month. Coleman visited the con

not been obeyed, and that his daughter
was still with the mother. Coleman then
had his former wife summoned to show

THE directors of the Bohemian Club by unanimous vote
yesterday excluded ttao Hearst yellow newspapere from
"the club premises. In this respect the Bohemian fol
lowed the example of the Pacific-Union, University.
Cosmos, San Francisco, Merchants'. BurUntrame and
Union 1-enguo clubs and the San Francisco Yereln of this city
and all the leading clubs of the East.
It is now an established fact that the yellow press Is ban
ished from the social clubs of San Francisco. The banishment
was in response to vigorous and outspoken demand of club
membership. The clubmen. In demanding nctlon. said, "We
have banished the yellow press from our homes, offices and
places of business, and we are Justified in demanding that the
anarchistic publications shall not be brought Into our clubs."
The Saint Claire Club of San Jose, which Is one of the Im
portant social institutions of the Santa Clara Valley and a club
whose roll of membership embraces the names of many promi
nent citizens, has placed its stamp of disapproval on the teach-
Ings of anarchy by excluding the Examiner from its reading 1
tables.
The expressed determination that the Hearst papers shall
no longer be tolerated Is riot in any sense a mere local caprice
or crusade. Throughout the Kant the Hearst yellow papers
nre_ utterly detested and scorned. The exclusion Is general.
Leading clubs, libraries, institutes, societies and associations
have placed the ban on the yellow sheets.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
DIPLOMACY has not yet settled the problems
of China's political relations with the rest of
the world, but nevertheless the affairs of the
country are brightening. Kaiser William's rage has
been appeased. Count Waldcrsee has ceased from
troubling, and trade i- reviving. In fact, exports to
China have about reached their normal proportions,
and the prospects for zn increase are bright.
The July figures just issued by the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics show the total exports to China
from the United States as $2,622,475, against
$1,349,697 in J u ' v . I 9 :XJ - * n *he seven months ending
with July, 1901, the total exports to China are
$9,703.7^7, against 59,100,321 in the corresponding
seven mo:.ths of the preceding fiscal year. Taking
the exports to the British and Russian possessions
in China also, the total for the seven months is
$10,090,816, as again<t $9,294,930 in the correspond
ing period of last year.
The showing made is regarded as exceptionally
good. Our July export trade to China has for sev
eral years past averaged only about $1,200,000, or
about one-half the total for July of this year. The
following table shows the July exports from 1897 to
the present year, and exhibits the notable increase
that has taken place since the termination of the
Boxer disturbances:
July. Amount.

1<*9 â 1.141,667
1900 * 1.3M.173
1901 2.654.223
; The figures for 1900 and for 1901 include our ex
ports not only to China proper, but also those to
the Russian possessions in China. While nearly all
articles of export show an increase, as compared
with those of July of the preceding year, it is, how
ever, chiefly in cottons, mineral oils, tobacco, lumber
and bicycles that the increase is most strongly
marked. Cotton cloth was the first to feel the effect
of the events of last year, and in the fiscal year end
ing with June the fall in our exports of cotton cloth
to China waÂ« nearly a million yards. In July, 1901,
however, there was an increase of over 18,000,000
yards as compared with July of Inst year, the figures
being: July, ujao, 15,519.945 yards; July, 1901,
33,988,783 yards. In mineral oil the figures for the
two years Â»ere: July. 1900, 2.45J.S45 gallons; July,
1001, 6,368,524 gallon*.
It will be seen tint the figure* indicate that our
trade with China iÂ» not to suffer any permanent loss
by reason of the events of the past year. Had and
blighting as the war ha* been to many of the best
provinces of China, it is probable, that in the end
the disturbance may result in a general benefit to
industry and commerce. Â¦
It waÂ» noted by the observant journalists of Berlin
that lirfore going to make his apologies to Kaiser
William Prince Chun and his staff ostentatiously vis
ited the tombs of the Emperor and Empress Freder
ick and laid wreaths of flowers upon them, and it is
believed that when he returns home an imperial
proclamation will inform' the Chinese people that
Chun was sent to â¢Berlin not to do homage to the
Kaiser but to condole with him on, the death of his
parents.
Professor Mason, curator of. the National Museum
at Washington, says: "The blood of all mankind
flow* in the Philippine' Island*. It is the most inter

islands should prove worthless as a ; market we can
use them as an. ethnological. museum.
Egypt has a trolley line from Cairo to the Pyra

It Is not worth while to discuss with serious
ness the ranting of this hypocritical disturber.
It Is worth while to note, however, that ona
of the worst charges he could make against th*
Employers' Association, apparently, waa that
It Ma "aa much a union aa th* Teamsters'
Union." He seema Incapable of comprehending
th* simple fact that employers have aa good
a right to organise aa employes, and that hla
denunciation* of, the on* organisation or union
render* hls/ulsoma prals* ot the other entirely
nugatory and Ineffective.
"Thero are W.CCO or (0,000 laboring men, not
counting the strikers," h* wild, "and if all
these would withhold their patronage from the
employers and merchanta this strtka would soon
come to an end. Do not furnish the sinews of
war to your enemies."
"Some of them. are fools, some axe knaves.
Give the devil his dueâ or, rather, tha devils,
for I believe there are many of them. They
live narrow lives, their brains bava been ex
tracted and tea leaves substltuttd. Poor de
luded fools. Idiots that they are, If they only
knew It the Employers' Association is as much
a union as the Teamsters' Union. â¢ â¢ â¢
The speaker bitterly denounced tha news
papers that have counseled moderation during
the pending strike and heaped fulsome lauda
tion upon the unscrupulous yellow Journals
that have urged and encouraged violence. He
said that "if tha country were as bad aa tha
papers anarchy would be a relief." According
to the Chronicle's report of the harangue, he
said, referring to th* Employers' Association:
"Father" Torke delivered himself of a har
angue on Saturday night before a crowd ot
strikers in San Francisco, in the course of
which he denounced the Employers' Association
of that city In aa vituperative terms aa his evil
tongue could find. "They are a un'.on com
prising the capital of San Francisco." ha de
clared, "and their purpom Is to crush out
unionism. They want to make you their
slave*. They are a mysterious body, and they
dare not look the people of San Francisco In
the face." .
"Father" Torke has broken out again. It Is
nothing new. He Is notorious as a firebrand
and "rabble rouser," small of mental caliber,
but large of mouth.' who is a chronic Indter of
class hatredâ a Denis Kearney on a small scale.
Without even Kearney's ability or breadth of
purpose. He is a fluent and flippant dealer
In billingsgate, who plays upon the evil pas
sions of evil-minded men. seemingly in mere
wantonness. He is an empty-headed ranter,
without the intellectual capacity to appreciate
the blessings ot free speech which he wantonly
violates.
The Bantings of Yorke.
The following editorial has been pub
lished in the Los- Angeles Times:
Criticism ' of Father Yorke.
Docs he think he can* drive the work
ingmen of California into the Catholic
church like a flock of sheep?
Can it be that he has lost his head?
All other speakers and writers for the
strikers save this Jack Cade of the cloth
havo discussed matters temperately, have
been conciliatory In their remarks, and
have accorded to the employers of San
Francisco and of the. State the instincts
at least of human beings. It has re
mained for this priest to assault all em
ployers in shameful - billingsgate, an J to
do everything in the power of a, dema
gogue and a blatherskite, to widen the
breach and to Intensify -whatever of bit
terness there may be In the hearts of the
strikers.
Why? * . , ' Â¦
The only marked violence of lan
guage heard on either side yet has
proceeded on two occasions from the lips
of this Catholic priest, . who now In al
most so many words charges the au
thorities with violence of act because
they have dared to attempt to preserve
law and order and protect citizens.
Leave the violence- to them; violence of lan
guage and violence of act. Let them have the
men who are recklessly shooting around the
streets. Let them have the men who are break-
Ing the law. Let them have the police, and
the soldiers, and have more policemenâ you
have nothing to do with violence, and you do
not want to have to do with these things.
This courteous and reflned gentleman of
the pulpit referred to Mayor Fhelan as
"a dishcloth on the top of a pole"; abused
all the San Francisco papers save the Ex
aminer, for no ether reason, according to
his own remarks, than that those jour
nals had reported the violent and cow
ardly assaults upon men who were trying
to earn an honest living; told his hearers
âwho know betterâ that there had been
virtually no violence, and even had the
audacity to say: . -
So have all the rich men and hangers-on of
the rich men of the city got togetherâ against
what? Against the teamsters? Not much.
Against the- longshoremen? By no means.
Against every man and every, woman who la
earning wages in the city of San Francisco,
In the State of California. ' /
Tcu must remember that these people bava
the narrowest kind of life. They are in their
holes. Their society is a little bit of a. clique.
mode up mostly of people who have had the
brains extracted from their skulls and dried
tea leavea substituted.
The only thing that is saving you In this
thins is the little amount of brains 'here are
against you.
They do not Imagine , that a worklngman has
any right In 'this world to judge as to his
work or ae to his wages, or to say that the
work is too hard or the pay ia'too little; they
believe that the only right a workingman has
is to. take his work and then take his wants,
and .to be thankful that he is allowed to
work at ail.
â¢ â¢ : â¢Â¦â¢" ' â¢
I these two Ideas, the Idea of ' the employer
thinking you are a chattel.- . â¢
Meantime. In order to have tha existing in
jurious strike Immediately ended so that peaoa
and harmony may again bring happiness to our
people and continued prosperity to our State,
I would earnestly recommend that all our
wage earners leave all questions in dispute
asHa and Immediately return to their former
employers and open negotiations. Individually,
with them, for the purpose ot obtaining their
previous positions. ,
1 would earnestly recommend all employers
to also leave all matters In dispute aside, and
regardleia whether tha employe is or la not
a member of any labor union, to Immediately
treat individually with their former workmen
for the purpose of reinstating them In their
previous positions, ao far aa tha present state
of their business may permit, and to the ex
tent that their places Have not already been
permanently filled by other satisfactory per
sona. Let both employer an<l amploya bury
th* hatchet, forset tha past, and look forward
to a happy and proaperoua future.

tion.
Many attempts to reconcile the contending;
parties have failed to bring about any settle
ment, and It now appears that the differences
between the Employers' Association on the one
side, and the leaders of th* labor unions on
tho other tide, are absolutely Irreconcilable.
The sÂ«rloui labor difficulties, which have been
exUtlr.sc for some time, and are still In force
In this .city, are bringing great Buffering to
our wage earners, many of whom, by re
maining Idle much longer, will Iom their
home* through their Inability to meet the
monthly installments due on them. Besides,
this strike !Â» causing loss to our manufacturing
and producing Interest*, and Is tending to re
duce occupation. In the future, for many la
borers.
v The following communication Is from a
prominent citizen and business man of
this city," who does not want his name
published, as he does not want the noto
riety which would naturally attend It:
How to Settle the Strike.
Here are some further beautiful speci
mens from this modern Jack Cade of the
pulpit:
You have, therefore, ladles and gentlemen.
Yorke's speech was filled with just such
remarks. Abuso took the place of argu
ment and blUinsfgate of calm counsel.
That is a deliberate and downright In
sult not only to the citizenry of San
Francisco, but to that of the entire State.
Not only that; it is a deliberate, a down
right and an infamous lie. Neither the
employers of San Francisco,* as a class,
nor the employers in any other section of
California, are .deserving of this shame
ful assault. And Peter Cade Yorke knows
it. In nine cases out of teii-the employers
of California's metropolis, whom this man
ho wantonly blackguards, have ever
proved themselves far better friends of
their employes than has this man, who
seeks to widen the breach and increase
the bitteVness for his own unworthy ends.
Tl'p Uouble In tha* when he bargains with
you lie does not want to bargain with you as
a mm; when he hires you he does not hire you
as a reasonable being; when he employs you
he does not want to employ you as an Ameri
can citizen, but he wants to bargain with an
animal, and to hire a man; he wants to have
ill his rcrvlce something which will do nothing
t.ut put ort work, and never think that It has
a Hnui.
The employer has been prone to look upon
the employe as a thing that when he employs
Mm re buys him body and soul and breeches.
Did this worker in the vineyard of the
sinless one, of Calvary preach his doctrine
on Saturday night In San Francisco? Not
he. He enunciated the gospel of hate. He
sought by. every art of the demagogueto
plant bitterness in the hearts of his hear
ers. He talked moderation with the lips
in one or two (sentences, but he belied his
own words when he gave vent to the most
malicious phrases calculated to stir his
audience to a pitch of revenge.
In speaking of the employers as a class
he said: .
A new commandment I give unto you, that,
you lova one another, as I havÂ« loved you
that you also love one another.
What language came from the lips of
this man who claims to follow. In* the
footsteps of the meek and lowly one, who
declared:
He had not one single word of common
decency to say for the men in San Fran
clsco who havo employed labor. They are
all, in his eyes, grinding* scoundrels.
He denied the well proved cases of dally
and nightly violence and abused the Em
ployers' Association for invoking the aid
of the police, without which protection
this Jack Cade of Catholicism knows the
streets of San Francisco would have run
In blood. ; . / ' . Â¦
His speech was utterly without argu
ment, entirely without reason, shamefully
devoid of facts.
In an address at Metropolitan Hall in
San Francisco on Saturday night he gave
vent to language more suitable to the lips
of a barroom blatherskite than a minister
of Christ.
Father Yorke is at It again.
IN the Sacramento Evenlng^Bee of September 23 there appeared an article in comment of the address which the Rev. Pe
ter C. Yorke delivered at Metropolitan Hall on September 21.' The article in the Bee was more than ordinary In Its force
and significance, bb It was written by C. K. McClatchy, one of the editors of the Bee and a professing Catholic "-w ho has
given much to the church of which he is a member. The Bee article is as follows: . ;
â Alameda. Arxaa. .
The Incendiary speech of Father York*
to strikers Saturday night, coming so
soon after the pronounced utterances of
Archbishop Klordan to the contrary. Is
bound to excite some wonder. The wide
spread belief that every utterance of the
Catholic clergy Is nicely calculated and
fully authorized by some power higher up
must be controverted by this spectacle of
a priest descending to violent harangue,
in spirit and purpose so radically differ
ent from his superior and the best canons
of his church. It would seem to show
that there Is pronounced freedom among
those who speak for the church, as there
is among other churches, and not at all
that exact pre-arrangement of public ac
tion that has largely been supposed.
Speech Without Authority.
Does he Imagine he Is a Peter the Her
mit of the "West, and that through this
crusade which he Is preaching for the
strikers he will be enabled to add won
derful strength in numbers to mother
church?-
If he does not, why Is he constantly
reminding his hearera that the Catholic
church is the great friend and ally of
the strikers In the present contest in San
Franciscoâ for no other Interpretation can
be put upon his attitude and his lan
guage? " -â¢
Why these words, dragged in by the
heels Into his Saturday night speech:
I owÂ» no apology to anybody to speak In
behalf of labor, but I . should owe an apology
to the past, to the great men ot the past, and
to those who founded my church, it I ware
to be found in any place except the place I
am In to-night. I apeak to yon of thlÂ» because
of the various whisperings and innuendoes that
have been eolng about as though the ttand I
took here the last time I spoke to yon waa
not in consonance with my profession. I want
you all to feel, whether you believe la any re-Â£
ligion, or in none, that there is one ors*alza>
tlon In this city to-day that belongs to the
poor, that is supported by the poor, an or
ganization, thank Ood, that you will never
live to see the day when Its threshold will not
be worn by the footsteps of the poor.
If this modern Peter, the Fisherman,
is hot putting* out his nets in thÂ© open
season for converts to Catholicism It
would be interesting to know what la
the name of common sense he Is doing.
It would be interesting also to know
if he has the sanction of the Catholic
church In his haranguesâ if, in fact, ho
has been sent out on a new mission,
â¢with . the purpose In view of adding to
the faithful.
. This is not an Idle 'question. ThlÂ» Is
the second time within a short period
that Rev. Peter C. York* has delivered
a talk to the strikers far more abusive
and Incendiary than any the labor
leaders have even thought of making.
This is the second . time he has shame-'
fully blackguarded decent citizens and
has Indiscriminately vilified honorable
men . as though they were heartless
slavedrivers and shameless scoundrels. .
There Is wrong and there is right on
each side. There are good men and there
are bad men on each side. But tha hon
orable citizen, the good man. predom
inates everywhere. ;.*-
It would be infamous If any minister
of any religion should denounce the
strikers by wholesale, even though he
might believe that hot-headed leaders
had led them astray. Such a clergyman
should feel upon his face the universal
scorn of public opinion like a lash of - \
thousand scorpions. ' .
That is what Rev. Peter *C Yorka de
serves to-day from every man who be
lieves in law and order and has any re
gard for truth and justice and common
decencyâ no matter whether that man
belongs to the ranks of employer or em
ploye, or whether in fact he Is a mem
ber of the Employers' Association or a
striking laborer. . C K. Â¦
His Address at Metropolitan Hall Denounced b/ the Editor of the
Sacramento Bee, Who Draws a Series of Comparisons.
THE SPIRIT OF THE PRESS
Such, indeed, is the moral of Jthe whole subject, with its awful; lesson of what yel
low journalism leads to. When men of eminence in business and in society no longer tol
erate rattlesnake journalism it will be no longer dangerous. In fact; respectability i can kili
itbysimplyrefusingtofeed.it. ; ' \; / s ; - - v Â«''
It is gratifying toknow that whatever Hearst may do or say by way of apology or
by whining he will never be able to delude the intelligence of the American people. The
lesson has been too profoundly impressed upon the public heart as well as the public mind
for sneak tactics to avail the coward. Moreover, 'the men who in the past have looked
upon and treated yellow journalism with a contemptuous toleration are aroused at last
to a sense of their own responsibility and will no longer give it support, either by pa
tronage or by commendation. , * ' .
In an addjress, before the Chamber of Commerce of New York City the Hon.
Abram'S. Hewitt pointed out the responsibility of the public and said: "Sp long as
prominent men'in public life, or in the walks of business, or in the spheres of society, are
willing to recognize by social receptions, by ..'Subscriptions to "the i". papers which we all 'Â¦ rec
ognize as the foundation of this sad development in^ public^^inion^by'; ; "th'eir.\ advertise
ments which support these papers, so long as > gentlemen; m your position shall give your
countenance, either by social intercourse or otherwise, to these enemies of mankind, to
these traitors to humanity, it is idle to deplore events Jike this. Let us see' that they are
made impossible by raising the standard; of the conscience of the community to a higher
plane, when it shall be impossible for the assassin to justify himself by the arguments
destructive logic." . . V â¢
THE YELLOWS.
Ay, turn your column rules, ye hypocrites!
Smear the dead President with your praiie!
Tell of his courage and hit manliness, /
His gentleness, his unobtrusive ways,
His high and noble qualities! Tis he
Whom late with coarse abuse and vile cartoon
And ribald jest to public execration
Ye held up. Wh.it hr.th wrought a change so soon?
Go, take n front seat among the mourners,
You who of his latest breath
Made merchandise. Weep for him now, ye knaves
Who hounded him to death. "*
"* The St. Louis Globe-Democrat denotinceswhat ft calls the "cowardly yellow hypo
crites," and points out how they are trying to" "get off with apologetic snivel"; while
the Chicago Tribune dedicates to the Hearstlings this sonnet: >
The Portland Oregonian says: "Of all the newspapers in the country none have
been so demonstrative in mourning for the late President ancFeulog^zing him extrava
gantly, and denouncing his murderer and his ilk, as the three papers published by Mr.
Hearst. Metaphorically speaking they have fairly shrieked from day to day tearing a
passion to tatters. â¢ Yet from day to day, from month to month, before this tragedy,
these papers have been the only ones in the country that have persisted in lampooning
and grossly caricaturing the late and present President."
The Chicago Journal says: "Why they should mourn McKinley's death is diffi
cult to see, save that they now fear the just judgment of men, and their excessive grief
only makes their attitude all the more suspicious. Hearst, if he has any sensibility at alC
has some faint glimmering of an idea of what he has done, and he is now seeking to
make people forget his shameless attacks on the late President by pushing forward quite
as shamelessly to"beÂ«the chief mourner at his grave."
The San Bernardino Times-Index says: "There is this difference between the-Ex
aminer and its predecessor, the Democratic Press. The latter was true to its principles
and went down with the flag of treason nailed to the masthead. The latter recanted at
the first sign of danger and sickened its colleagues with a pitiful whine and a page full
of prayers for the man it had helped to murder."
Hardly any phase of the yellow offense has gÂ«ven a greater disgust to the public
than the hypocritical mourning wfiich the yellow journals manifested as soon as the out
burst of public indignation followed the shooting. - s
The Ventura Free Press says: "How noticeable the attitude of the Examiner be
fore and after the assassination of President McKinley! The brutal cartoons, the vicious,
malignant editorials, the expressed sympathy for anarchists and assassins, the cruel at
tacks upon the man whom the people of the nation selected as their leader, the pander
ings to the depraved and animal natures of men, have given way to a fawning lamenta^
tion over the crime that is sickening in its contrast!"
The Springfield Union in describing the condition of public sentiment in Massachu
setts sin<;e the assassination says: "It is noticed that the man who how buys a yellow
journal conceals it until he is out of sight. A man who will buy a paper that he is
ashamed to read in public should be ashamed to buy it or read it on the quiet."
The New York Journal Of Commerce says: "When newspapers day after day in
type and in revolting cartoon depict certain men eminent in business and in the State as
oppressors of the poor and as beasts of prey living in luxury on what they take away from
other people, they are cultivating envy and hatred, malice and murder."
The St. Louis Globe-Democrat pithily says: "The colors of anarchy are the red
flag and the yellow journal."
Tbe Chicago Journal, in refuting the plea that the Hearst papers were merely crit
icizing the President, says: "Is it-free discussion to breed. anarchy by exciting the hatred
of the poor against the rich, to ascribe all the evils of society to trusts and monopolies,
and the stress of poverty to the oppression of those in power? Is it free discussion to
publish day after day such cartoons as the Chicago American and the New York Jour
nal published, entitled 'Willie and His Papa' "? ;
The Colorado Springs Mail, inj-eferring to the influence of the New York Journal
and Chicago American, says: "There is reason to believe," too, that if unchecked it may
end in something much worse than mere discontent. It is degrading to the morals of
the country and belittling to its intellect to feed on such stuff as the yellow journals pro
vide. What issthe remedy? There is only one that we know ofâ to strike at the only
vulnerable place in such newspapers, their cash account. If people would stop reading
them they would not pay; if reputable firms would stop advertising in them they would
suspend publication."
The Philadelphia Inquirer says: "That there is a deep-seated aversion to what has
become known in these days as yellow journalism can no longer be questioned. It i3 the
general belief that the assassination of President McKinley" was largely due to the reck
lessness of newspapers that have vilified public men r.nd have made anarchists by their
violence of language." .
The Cleveland Leader says: "First and foremost the yellow press of the United
States, the mercenary and venal newspapers which pursued "and vilified the dead Presi
dent during the four years that he occupied the high office to which he was elected by the
people, will be held responsible for the feeling oj unwarranted hatred which so many of
the people entertained toward him. Congressman Burroughs at the meeting 4ield on
last Sunday evening at Plymouth Church charged that the yellows were largely to blame
for the assassination, and other distinguished speakers have made the same assertion."
The Epworth Herald* Chicago, says: "It is how clear that Czolgosz is not a lunatic,
but an anarchist. It is said he learned his anarchistic sentiments from Emma Goldman.
That woman has done much harm. But it is more than probable that this man, whom every
American loathes, got some of his education from certain daily papers which are widely
circulated in centers ot our population. The cartoons in these papers are only a trifle
more dangerous than their editorial utterances. They .array class against class and pro
mote a bitterness which logically ends in, open and destructive violence. Every wild
eyed socialist, every blatant anarchist, reads these inflammatory sheets with delight.
* * * Is it any wonder we have anarchy in New York and (Chicago? Indeed, it Js a
wonder we do not have more of it." .'
BY way of further evidence that the condemnation of the Hearst journals for re
sponsibility in the crime of Czolgosz is not the outcome of personal antagonism
by any particular set of men, or of local antipathy^, but is the expression. of a deep
rooted and widespread conviction of the great mass of the American people, we
submit this morning further declarations of the press. Many of them are the utterances
of the country press, whose s editbrs are in no way business rivals of the yellow, but who,
being close to the people, reflect clearly and express forcibly the sentiments of their
communities. *- (

that amount with the $460 Included, but
tho Government official who was receiv
ing the money had no account of the
missing $4t>0 and handed It back to Neall.
Colonel and Paymaster F. N. Cox tes
tified that Neall had failed to deposit the
sum In controversy and that his signa
ture to the certificate was a forgery.
Sergeant Allan Coan described the rou
tine of receiving .deposits from soldiers
and the books of account that were kept.
Morgan Backus, a photographer, *ub
mltted some enlarged photographs of the
disputed signatures and they wero ad
mitted in evidence.
The most important witness of the day
was handwriting expert Daniel T. Ames.
He testified that in his opinion the names
of Cox and Brooks to the certificate of
deposit were forged by Neall.

BEFORE A JURY
BISHOP'S ROBE
FOR A PASTOR
of Trinity to Be
Advanced. \
The Rev. Dr. Olampett
See of Olympia Is Said to
Be His Coming Field of
Usefulness.
One of. the most Important functions
pertaining to the coming. Episcopal Con
vention will be the formation of new
dioceses and the selection of Bishops.
Endowed dioceses . elect their, own
Bishops. Missionary . Bishops are ap
pointed. Of the. latter the diocese of
Olympla, Washington, Is one. The un
exampled expansion in population and
physical resources of the State of "Wash
ington is fully understood by the mem
bers of the convention and there Is a
determination expressed to appoint the
strongest man. Pugct Bound is looked
upon as a strategic point and a Bishop
possessed of sterling qualities can do
great service -in that district. .
For this station the name of Dr. Clam
pett, for the last two years rector of
Trinity Church, has been mentioned. Dr.
Clampett has been associated with im
portant parishes in the dioceses of Spring-
Held, Maryland and California and has
acquired the respect and admiration of
all with whom he haa had dealings. A
graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, he
is i naturally a scholar of high attain
ments. Ills eloquence is admitted, while
his temperament and financial abilities
fit him for high responsibilities.
Trinity Church, which has already fur
nished a Bishop, might object to -losing
Dr. Clampett after so brief, a pastorate,
but If there is a demand for Its* rector
to go higher and Dr. Clampett should ac
tept the translation the church will
loyally submit.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
On account of the foreign patents Mr. Clifford did not care to describe his de-
vice, with the process he uses, but The Call representative saw the result of a
trial and the drawings of patent now pending at the Patent Olflce. The Inventor
also showed stalks and cleaned fiber from the wild hnmp which grows In this
State and In Arizona, but which is without value until some machine can do this
work. By hia plan this plant can be utilized, and the fiber, which is as good as
Manila. Is worth $120 a ton in New York for ropinp. carpets and tv.ine. There is
a sÂ«ction where this wild hemp grows fio rank that It Is like wild mustard ten or
twelve feet tall, for forty miles as on one plantation, being useful only as food for
wild game, which live on the seeds of this valuable plant. A "Report on Hemp.
Jl2.mle. Etc.." of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, made by Charles
R. Dodge, shows the success of Mr. Charles Toppln of Salem. Mass.. In d-gum-
rning and manufacturing ramie fiber jrrown In China. He says: "I am " now
carding and spinning yarns on both woolen and cotton machines, no changes be-
ing made with either. I have spun, commercially, both coarse and fine yarn, and
this by the ton. These yarng bring 75 cent* to Jl per pound In cr.-iy. and In colors
SI 59 to C per pound. â¢ â¢ â¢ We are In the market for American crown ramie."
In preparing the prour.d for ramie two or three plowings should be given for
a good Â«txrt. end leave the earth in the best possible order, as It is prepared only
once In fifteen years.
Another good feature of the ramie Is that It thrives just as well on alkali land
as elsewhere, thus utilizing thousands of acres of land now lying waste.
The vast Importance to California of a new Industry that Is so properly adapt-
ed to our State attracted the attention of a Call representative to Mr. H. A. Clif-
ford of 1224 Noe street, an inventor, who showed him his device for and process of
obtaining the beautiful fiber from the ramie stalks. About an hour from the time
the Ftalks were placed in the device they were taken out. Then with a clothes
wringer's crushing the fiber was bruken loose from the stalks, and with the second
treatment In the device the gum or resin is alsÂ«o taken from the fiber, entirely
without chemicals or injury to the fiber. Mr. Clifford cl.-jlms that a ton an hour
of the stalks can be used, and in a day of ten hours two tons of the fiber can be
produced.
The ramie plant may be started by seeds or roots set four feet apart each way.
and the stalks when two feet tall are bont over and partly covered with soil to
cpain take root, thus covering the pround as in an alfalfa field. The leaves. of thÂ«
ftalk cover the ground, so no weeds grow.
In the United States the ramie will Krow where corn will produce a crop, but
Is best adapted to a warm climate. In California and other places where the roots
are not killed ty frost each winter It needs no care, only to cut from one to four
times a' season, according to Irrigation and climate. At "the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley the ramie plants were set out twenty years ago and are Â«!H In a
healthy condition. The ramie stalks prow from elx to sixteen feet tall, according
to location, making- the product of an aciv from eljcht to ten tons of stalks, or one-
fifth of that weight In fiber, varying in value, according to the way It is cleaned,
from $3tt to JiOCv per ton.
The ramie or China &rprs Is a native of tho Orient nna Is of tho nettle family.
It5 value ns a textile fibef far exceds linen, both In strength and fineness. For
the pact fifty years tho ramie plant has baffled nil efforts to work It with (success
In commerct-il quantities. In Ohlnn The people split each stock by hand with a
bamboo knife, tho woody part Is broken out and the flbcr Is left In gootl condition.
The liber Is encased in a pum or resin, which holds tho beautiful libers so firmly
that they nre destroyed before the sum will yield when tried In any machine that
>vould work the ramie fast enoush to be a success. The Government of India hR3
orrered CÂ».0ft) for a machine thnt would suitably dccortbato ramie. Brazil, Mexico
j.na tome I-Â«ropean fcv.vernments have alro offered rewards upon the approval of
the ver>- best writers on textile fibers.

alkali. There are a -thou-
sand virtues of soap; this
one is enough.;. You can
a soap that has no
biting-alkali in it. \
All sorts of atorts sell It, especially
druggists; all sorts of people use it.
What is wanted of soap
for .the skin is to wash it
clean and not hurt it.
Pure soap does that. This
is why we want pure soap;
and when we say, pure,
we mean .without alkali.

â¢'Mcaetary conditions will require continued
watcfcftiloess. Secretary Gage Is wisely doing
liis utmost to cfifset the adverse operations of
the Treasury Jjpon the money market: but It
is cuesticaable if his efforts will be sufficient
to avert danger of stringency. Thus far, by
purchase cf bonds and anticipation of interest.
as well as by fncreasin*? Government boldintrs
la public depositaries, the Secretary has been
able to Increase the available funds about
J^.Ot)0,cC0l This relief is Insufficient and re
courre must be had to gold imports In view of
lae present low conditions of bank reserves.
For tcne da>s foreign exchange has been hov
erisg at the gold importing point, and shipments
of the precious metal this way are shortly ex
pected 1 . None of the European markets, how
ever. Â«re willing to aid such a niuvement.
They do not enjoy sparing gold that may be
locked up in the United States Treasury in

There was no disturbance in the money mar
ket beyond that caused by the calling for ad
ditional collateral on loans, due to the shrink
age in values, but the liquidation was accom
panied by the paying off of loans on a large
scale. Although London took the buying *l<le
this murnlng exchange continued to advance.
The demand for exchange is in the nature of
short covering. The operation In effect Is the
paying off of loans In foreign markets by <lo
meitlc borrowers, who counted upon the large
ttupply of cotton and *ruin bills normal to this
Â«ea5on to cover former sales of exchange at a
profit. But cotton If being held at the South
for hiKher rates and the train movement last
week had become so small as to lead to open
cutting of freight rates. The admitted de
moralization In the eautbound frÂ»Uht situation
heavily discredits the much-vaunted .immunity
of Interests as srcurlty aicainst Just that de

Judge Hebbard yesterday overruled the
demurrers Interposed by the Board of Po
lice Commissioners in the actions of the
five police officers who are suing for rein
statement in the rank they held at the
time of their removal from the force or
disrating. Judge Hebbard holds that the
statute of limitations does not bar pro
ceedings for reinstatement in the case of
police officers d.smissed from the force
and pointed out that the case of Lieuten
ant Price made it plain that the Commis
sioners had no right to dismiss an officer
without trial. .

"Qeorgle" Jones, the barytone with
West's minstrels, Is well known on the
coast. He first made his dramatic ap
pearance in this city, treading the his
toric boards at the Bush Street Theater.
He played the title role in "Little Lord
Fauntleroy," and when he grew too old to
play roles. calling for golden hair hanging
down his back his worldly-wlso parents
shipped him. to Europe and allowed a
voice builder to go to work on 'his vocal
chords. He returned to this country a
full-fledged barytone and was engaged as
a vocalist by West for his minstrel nhow.
In New York "Ocorgle" made quite a
hit, and among his admirers was a Mrs.
John Mllford. She doted on his singing,
and when West's minBtrcln packed trunks
and came West on their annual road tour
Mrs. Mllford was ' indiscreet enough to
travel with the company without first
securing her husband's consent. â¢ . ; â¢ '. . - Â¦ Â¦
! John Mllford showed enough Interest In
hlÂ« wife to follow her to Denver. His first
move was to find where she waff located,
and his second to land a fierce left swing
on Barytone "Geotgle? . Jones' Jaw. He
followed up his attack with several vi
cious blows, < which laid , the vocalist low.
and which necessitated' his I detention- In
his room and repeated calls for raw meat
to place on his injured face.' . /
. After the Irate husband's storm . of fury
had spent he returned' to New York, de
claring he would ' Institute divorce pro
ceedings upon arriving there. Mrs. Mll
ford decided that she was destined to be
a star In the theatrical firmament and se
cured the | position . of chorus girl with
"Florodora. 1 .'. 'Jones came West with. the
minstrel troupe, but '.before leaving Den
ver the young people promised they would

It Is said that her husband Is coming all

Thua reads a telegram received In this
city yesterday from Manager Hcrr of the
company named, which plays at Fresno
to-night. Back of this telegram Is a sad
story of a wayward and stage-struck
young wife, a dashing barytone with
West's minstrels and an irate husband
with a strong sense of revenge and a still
stronger "left-hand punch."

Inquiry among the members of the
Metal Trades Association yesterday elicit
ed the information that under no clrcum-
Ktances would the nine-hour system be
recognized. With the exception noted no
firm has Riven their men assurance that
the nine-hour system would prevail. In
the absence of authentic data by the of
ficers of the Iron Trades Council, the Iron
men claim, their statements alone are
worthy of credence.
It Is claimed by the leaders of the ma
chinists that all but sixty-five shops arc
unionized. This statement is declared to
be false by the employers themselves.
Of all tho shops which are represented in
the Metal Trades Association, said a
prominent iron man yesterday, only one,
Webber & Alcher. at 103 Beale street,
permitted their men to return on a nine
hour baxis. In this instance the number
of men was only two.
The assertions of the officers of the Iron
Trades Council that the machinists and
molders now returning to work are doing
so under agreements with their employers
that the nine-hour schedule with nine
hours' pay shall prevail during the winter
at least is denied by the leading members

WILL BE EXAMTrTirP
The Examiner yesterday morning print
ed a statement purporting to show that
the number of cases treated at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital from July 16 to
September 21. 1900. exceeded the number
of cases treated during the same dates of
the present year. The inference sought
to be drawn was that there was no un
usual violence prevalent in San Francisco.
The figures given by the Examiner are
correct as far as they go. with the excep
tion that the ca?es treated at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital for September are not
included in the summary.
The attempt to show, however, that the
casts of violence are only normal In this
city is almost too silly for refutation, it
is a matter of general knowledge that the
number of assault cases occurring be
tween the beginning of the strike and the
present time is unprecedented in the his
tory of the city. While It is true that the
number of accidental Injuries between the
dates mentioned in the present year do
not exceed those occurring between
parallel dates for 1900, the explanation is
patent to any one. Owing to the strike
the number of men working in various
capacities has been greatly decreased over
that of last year, iiany of the great'in
dustrial concerns have been almost idle
until recently and the others have been
working with depleted forces. Conse
quently the number of accidents to labor
ing men has decreased in proportion to the
number of men employed.
Had the Examiner desired to be fair In
its statement it would have noted that
between the dates mentioned for the pres
ent year the cases of assault treated at
the emergency hospitals exceeds those re
corded during similar dates In 1900 by
more than five to one. This shows con
clusively that the figures quoted by the
Examiner entirely rail in indicating that
no unusual reign of violence has prevailed
In San Francisco since the beginning of
tbe strike.
Show No Violence Exists Here.

When nominations for Coroner wero

nominated by acclamation.*
Following the nomination of Coroner an
assessment of 10 cents a head was levied
upon all delegates to meet expenses.
Delegate Roxburgh of the Pressmen's
Union took the floor to oppose the nom
ination of candidates for District Attor
ney. City and County Attorney and Police
Judges. Delegates from the unions com
prising the City Front Federation were
heartily In accord with Roxburgh's prop
osition, saying "that the present Police
Judges were treating the strikers fairly
and there. was no need of going back on
them." Parry took the same stand, say
ing that the position taken by the present
Police Judges was satisfactory to the
workingmen and it was only right to
leave well enough alone. The mcilon
was unanimously carried: ' .
Prior to the final adjournment a rising*
vote of thank." was tendered Chairman
Millmore for the able and Impartial man

J. S. Parry, who was the author of tha
resolutions, explained that the proced

law, but the delegates would not accept
his explanation and placed the resolu

convention should nominate its County
Committee and a committee consisting of
one from each union was appointed to se
lect the twenty-five members required.
4 Over the selection of a County Commit*
tee of twenty-flve members the Union
Labor party last night spent about two
hours. The trouble was precipitated by
the presentation of a series of resolutions
naming certain members, but as no one
for a moment could be found to father ttaa
series a delegate asked "whether .tha
resolutions were prepared In a Fifth and

" The advance sale for West's Minstrels
opens this morning. This notable aggre
gation of comedians and singers begins
a week's engagement at the California on
Sunday night. The organization this year
Is said to be one of exceptional strength
and Is headed by the famous comedian,
Billy Van, who needs no Introduction to
the theater-goers of this city. Among the
singers are Manuel Romalne, George
Jones, the "boy barytone," Clement Stew

basso, and a big chorus. In the olio will
be Billy Van In a new monologue; the
Zeb and Zarrow trio of trick cyclists;
McMahon and King, a colored sketch
team; the Rio Brothers, acrobats, and
Carr. McDonald and Parshley. musical
artiste. Meantime. "A Texas Steer" is
amusing large audiences this week at the
California.
"Nabucco" at the Tlvoli Is proving a
splendid drawing card, and the perennial
ly popular "Carmen," though In its third
week, shows no diminution of interest.
The enterprise of the Tlvoll management
In producing In no effective fashion the
seldom-heard "Nabucco" has been well
rewarded by the enthusiastic patronage
accorded the opera and the loudly ex
pressed gratitude of musicians at the rare
opportunity. Salassa is captivating in
the name part and the role of Abigail af
fords Barbareschl perhaps an equal
chance of doing her best. The cast all
round Is notably efficient. Pollettini and
Cortesi being highly pleasing in their re
spective parts. "Carmen" goes to-night
again, and next week alternates with
"Cavalleria Rustlcana" and "I Pagllaccl."
The Judges explained their reasons for
continuing many cases cited by the fore
man of the Grand Jury, but Judge Ca
baniss had a hard time In explaining why
he Imposed heavy bail upon policemen
accused of assault while strikers have
been permitted to secure their release
upon nominal bail.
The Grand Jury will inquire further
into Police Court "methods, particularly
in reference to strikers', cases, and will In
its reports mike some recommendations
as to the selection of Juries to try cases
in the Police Courts.
The Judges were all questioned about
the jury system, and they volunteered
the information that it was next to Im
possible to secure a jury of citizens which
had backbone onough to convict a striker
of assault. They testified that juries re
turned verdicts of guilty In only about
three of twenty cases submitted to them.
Judge Cabaniss was questioned by Fore
man Frank J. Symmes for fully an hour
and a half, and that he had-received a
severe grilling was evident from the ex
treme nervousness he displayed when he
made his way out of the jury-room.
The Grand Jury questioned the Judges
upon various matters pertaining to the
strike, and they particularly asKcd why
so many continuances of strikers' cases
had been had in the court over which
Judge Cabaniss presides. He laid the
failure to dispose of the majority of the
cases to the police, claiming that it was
impossible for ihera to appear In court
when the cases were called.
Judges Cabaniss, Conlan, Fritz and Mo-
Kan were summoned before the jury, and
all the Judges except Cabaniss explained
satisfactorily the disposition of the vari
ous cases before them nnd their reasons
for granting continuances.
The methods of the Police Court Judge*
in handling the cases of strikers charged
with making brutal assaults upe'n > non
union workmen occupied the attention of
the Grand Jury yesterday afternoon.
There wer<- many Instructive talks dur

to the grain interests, among the speakers
being Frcfessor D. T. Fawler of the State

counties of Colusa, Merced, Stanislaus,

W. 9. GreÂ«ne of Colusa for his pplendld
effort toÂ»ard organizing the present

The special committee which was ap

to \-isit Port Costa and which returned
a caustic report declaring the cause of

a flurry by submitting to the convention

Mr. O Hare sat down before he had in

perience know anything of its nature or
characteristics. At first a little nicer or
sore appears, then glands of the neck or
groins swell; pimples break out on the
breast, back or sortie, other part of tha
body and fill with yellow pustular matter;
the mouth and throat become sore and
the tongue is at all times badly coated.
Headaches arc frequent, and muscles ami
joints throb and hurt, especially during
damp, rainy vreather. These are some of I
the symptoms of that most loathsome of
all diseases, Contagious Blood Poison.

PROPOSALS.A Chinese woman was shot and fatally
wounded in a lodging-house at 1023 Dii

two Chinese, who are at present un
known to the police.
- The woman is supposed to have beÂ«n
asleep at the time the two highbinders
entered her room. The two men fired live
shots, only one of which took effect, tho

Cooper has still a .charge of perjury
against him for falsely testifying before
Judge Cook at the first trial, and he will
probably be Indicted for bigamy for mar
rying Miss Schneider while he had other
wives living. Miss Bertha Young will
likely be kept here to testify to her mar
riage with Cooper In Brisbane. Australia.
In 18%. A charge of perjury could also be
brought against him for his testimony at
the present trial regarding the telegrnms.
which he swore he wrote in his cell In
the Offtden jail. This statement was flatly
contrudlcteu by Detective Pender of Og
den.
When court opened yesterday morning
District Attorney Byington commenced
his argument for the prosecution. He was
followed by Attorney Murphy for the,de
fendant, who made a strong attack upon
tho Police Department, with the object of
blinding the eyes of the jury to the real
facts in the case. He also attacked the
Schneider family, claiming that they had
been actuated by the glamour of wealth In
seeking an alliance with Cooper. Assistant
District Attorney Alford closed the arRU
menta and delivered a masterly address,
excoriating the defendant. . Â¦
Tho Judge summed up and the case was
given to the jury shortly. before/ o'clock.
In twenty mlnutea It returned with a ver
dict of guilty, and Cooper flushed red and
then became as pale us death. At the pre
vious trial before Judge Cook the jury
disagreed. 1

alwaya quarreled with me.

twice before. The Aril wife *Â»t a divorce from

After my ton went back to school I telephoned
for my ilster to come over. Â° She came over and
left again, as (the said she Â¦ would not stay
while we were quarreling so. Â¦ Just after my
sister left the house my husband got the pistol
and said he would kill me and kill himself,
too. He came toward me .with the pistol and
1 grabbed his arm and clutched him about the
body ai best I could, to keep him from shoot
ing. He ' had . hold of my arm, and . while we
were In that position he flred once and then
fired again. . I did not see whether he shot at
me or shot at himself. He fell Into a rock-
Ing chair and then I asked him to forgive me
and told him to live again. Then I ran out
and called my sister, who was about. a block
from the - house, and told her that he was
shot. ' My sister came back to the house and
she and the doctor put him on the bed.
My huKband had threatened to kill me be
fore. Only last Saturday he threw mo on the
couch and put his knee on me and stood- over
me and said he would kill me. Whenever ho
threatened to kill me It was always because
he raid I wanted to leave him. He said he
would never let any other man have me. He

give you as much as we wanted to (without raising the price) we had to buy
more than we needed. But we thought that if we could' give folks- more
than anybody else could give them we'd sell more. And we have. You've
