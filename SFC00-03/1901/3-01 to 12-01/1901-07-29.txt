A Cougar Jumps Into Her
Wagon and the Horse
Runs Away.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. July 28.â Miss Mary E. Bow
ler, aged 22 years,, of Cavendish, Idaho,
had a thrilling experience last week with
an enormous cougar. The details of the
story reached here to-day.
Accompanied by several other members
of her family, Miss Bowler had been out
picking fruit in a rented orchard several
miles from any house Â¦ and on a ranch
which was not occupied. The family lives
In a newly settled country, which is thick
ly wooded. About sunset the young wom
an started home in a light wagon partly
filled with fruit baskets. She was to pre
pare supper, leaving the rest of the fam
ily to follow, with a lumber wagon an hour
later. *
About a half-mile beyond the orchard
the young woman was ' startled to see an
Immense cougar creep out of the brush
within ten feet of her wagon. Her horse
shied and began running. The road being
rough the horse could not make very fast
progress. The cougar started to race,* and
within five minutes had jumped into the
wagon, leaving . only a light seat sepa
rating him from, Miss Bowler.
Realizing that her life depended upon
her presence of mind, Miss Bowler seized
her whip, which fortunately had 'a heavy
handle. With this she repeatedly struck
the cougar over the head, sometimes. with
the lash/and at other times with. the butt
end. With her left hand she, guided the
frightened horse, which. broke into a gal
lop, drawing the wagon- over, stones and
stumps, which fact, contributed -to. Miss
Bowler's success in . warding off the in
furiated beast, since the latter was in
danger of being dashed out of the vehicle.
Miss Bowler's object was to keep, the
cougar from Jumping over the seat beside
her until her ' home should : be reached,
when she felt sure he would jump out.
Her thrilling ride â¢ lasted ' for â¢ over two'
miles. At the ; edge of the woods,., where

VANCOUVER, B. C, July 28.â Bruised
by a beating and emaciated from absolute
starvation for five days, a Japanese fiiih-
Vrman was brought to this city to-day. He
was picked up by an. Indian fisherman
from a small and uninhabited island lying
between here and Nanaimo.
i The Japanese was carried to the hospi
tal here and will probably regain jis
health in a week. He was. insane when
found and was vainly trying to batter
down the walls of the cabin where he Iiad
been confined on the little island where
he was marooned. The Japanese was in
a horrible condition: He told his story
through an interpreter to the police t!.iis
afternoon. . Â¦ ,
Last Sunday he left Steveston in a flsh
ing boat and was. out all that night and
all day Monday.' On Monday night he 'says
he was met by a boatload of white fisher
men, who told him to quit fishing. . He
saw them again after he had pulled in
some fish. They were angry with him lor
fishing on account of. the strike which was
at. that time being settled. v They struck
him on the head and when he became ccn
scious he found that his boat was gone,
having been sivashed in and sunk, and- his
net and oars had been cut up and thrown
overboard. On Tuesday morning 'they
landed ; him on ; a rocky island just wost
of Bowen Island and well out of the way
of -any passing | boats.
The captors put him in a little. shanty
and â¢ there he ; remained â¢ almost unable ; to
move. He remembers 'Â¦ trying to get* cut

CAPB TOWN. July 28. â Boers arÂ» scat
tered throughout the upper districts of
Cape Colony in small marauding parties.
Some are -within a few miles of Indwe.
Others are around Jamestown and be
tween Molteno and Burghersdorp. Sev
eral parties are close to Cradock. It is
reported that among Steyn's captured
documents letters were found regarding
a plan for Generals Dewet and Delarey
to Join forces in making a dash into Cape
Colony.
Replying to an appeal to the Mayor
that members of the Duke of Edinburgh's
volunteer rifles, the local corps, be re
leased from active duty after twenty
months' service, Lord Kitchener has
pointed out that the present disturbed
f tate of the colony makes any reduction
of the strength difficult and most unde
sirable. ' ,
Caves Vacated by Boers.
PRETORIA. July 28.â From July 1 to
July 22 the number of Boers captured,
wounded or surrendering was 1068. Caves
that were occupied by the Boers have
been discovered in t*he Lydenburg dis
trict. They were hurriedly vacated by
the occupants when the British ap
proached. The caves were well furnished
and stocked with provisions. A quantity
of silks and satins was also found In
them, and it Is supposed that these were
looted from stores.
A military census will be taken on July
SX. Colonel Garrett in a skirmish near
Vereeniging captured twenty-nve Boers
and a number of cattle and wagons.

makes the following statement to-day:
"In consequence of the Dally Mall's publi
cation of the fact that the Boers killed
British wounded at Vlakfontein all cables
from the correspondent who made the
charges have since been suppressed."
It also asserts that Mr. Brodrlck, the
War Secretary, Is using the Dally Mail's
publication of Lord Kitchener's new plan
of campaign as an occasion for "the in
sinuation that we obtained the news of
Lord Kitchener's scheme by purloining
documents at the War Office," and has
cut off the Daily Mail's daily list of casu
alties, having also informed the Dally
Mail in writing that he hajd â¢warned the
news agencies under contract with the
Daily Mail not to supply the paper with
casualty lists or other official news.
Choate as a Mediator.
United States Embassador Choate has
left London for Holland, says the Dally
Express, not for a holiday, but, bo rumor
states, at the Invitation of Mr. Kruger,
Â¦who desires him to act as mediator In
bringing about a settlement. ':J".\ Â¦'Â¦*
It would naturally Ire supposed that a
settlement could not take place without
the Irrepressible Dr. Leyds, but if Choate
has gone to Holland, Dr. Leyds has left
the country for Brussels, starting Satur
day.
No importance is attached to this rumor
by the Dally Express, for the paper refers
to It editorially In a facetious vein as a

Thirteen Thousand Claims Are to Ba .
Distributed and Registrations
Number One Hundred and '.\f^tS
Seventy Thousand. fÂ»
Eli RENO, O. T., July 28.â All la ex
pectancy to-night among the thousands of
homeseekers here over the grand land lot
tery that begins to-morrow., There are
13,000 claims to be distributed, and so eaca
of the 165,865 persons who have registered
during the past flteen days have about one
chance' In thirteen of winning. It Is a long
shot, but every one apparently feels con
fident of being numbered among the
lucky, and in consequence good nature
prevails.
The scene lacks the great excitement of
the "run" which has heretofore been a
part of other land openings In this part of
the country, but the last act in the throw-
Ing open to settlement of the Kiowa-Co
manche reservations will not be without
life and animation. The drawing will
take place In the center of the city and
will be witnessed by thousands of people.
It will be accomplished on a large plat
form in the open around which the slop
ing hillsides form a natural amphitheater.
A commission appointed last week by Sec
retary Hitchcock and composed of "Will
iam A. Richards, assistant commissioner
of the general land office, and who has
had charge of the registration; D. P. Dy
er of St. Louis, former United States Dis
trict Attorney, and Frank Dale, ex-Chief
Justice of Oklahoma.
Anxiety of the Applicants.
; The situation here upon the eve of the
eventful day Is quiet, but one, can see
evidences of expectant anxiety. There are
probably 5000 strangers' here now and all
incoming train* are loaded. Several dele
gations have Keen organized and'paraded
the streets. The drawing will commence
promptly' at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The registration by land districts as ap
proved by the commissioners is Lawton
district, 88,000, and El Reno district, 79,000,
making a' total' of 167,000 registrations.
These figures were given out by a clerk
In the Government employ. It is thought
that the largest crowd, win be here to
morrow of any day since the opening of
registration. But 500 names will be drawn
to-morrow for each of the two land* dis
tricts.
Land Inspected Beforehand.
After the flrst day the drawing will pro
ceed with greater rapidity, and It is ex
pected that the last envelope will have
been drawn by Thursday night next. The
lucky ones will be permitted to file on a
claim in the order " that their numbers
have been drawn from the wheel. All ap
plicants for homesteads have been per
mitted to Inspect the land beforehand, to
select a claim in case he should be lucky
enough to draw a number.
Besides the three commissioners ap
pointed to superintend .the drawing and
the men who will draw the envelopes
from the wheel space on the platform will
be provided for newspaper representa
tives. . .
Representative Richards declines to
night to' disclose the names of the "ten
men who will draw the numbers from the
wheel, and said the selection would not
be made until just before the drawing be
gins.
INDIANS SEEKING LANDS. 7.
Own Selections.
Under Law* They Can Hake Their
OKLAHOMA CITY, July 2S.-Keo Tuck,
a Sac Indian, has given notice, at the
Land Office of El Reno of his intention
to file upon the quarter section of land
adjoining the townsite of Lawtoiy which
will be the principal town In the new
county of Kiowa and Comanche . reserva
tions! This Is probably the most valu
able tract out of the entire 13,000 acres
to be entered. , The application Is made
under ' a .j section of the â¢;, United States
Statutes passed In 1887, which gives to
every homeless Indian the right to go to
any part of the public domain and to
make entry for any tract of land that la
not in the possession of a homesteader.
The section has never been repealed, and
the right of the Indians who have no al
lotments or who were omitted from the
tribal rolls, is one that It is stated they
can exercise at any. time.
With Ko' Tuck there wer.e sixty mem
bers of the Sac and Fox tribes who pro
pose to make filings, and " attorneys
throughout the country are searching for
other Indians who have lost their tribal
relations and , who .have not secured pub
licatlon of homestead, tracts. It is be
lieved there are 500 in the two local tribes
who can secure such claims in advance
of the ones who have registered by sim
ply making their filings. '.'iV.
The plan is to select the lands they de
sire and then so Into court and ask for
a restraining order to prevent the regis
ters and receivers from accepting filings
on. the, tracts selected. This will, if,suc
cessful,-give the Indians time to perfect,
their title to the best quarter sections of
land in the new county. . .

' Special Dispatch to The Call. T
TACDMA, July 28.â Reports from. Alas
ka are to the efTect that the July fresh
ets have suddenly terminated all mining
operations on Bear, Clear and Rose
creeks, in the Porcupine mining district.
These and other creeks are overflowing
and the miners have abandoned them, for
dry diggings higher, up toward the Chil
kat Mountains.
Andrew L. Barr. a prominent miner,
who reached Pyramid Harbor last week,
says that all flumes, sluices, bridges, to
gether with cabins along the creek bot
toms, have been washed away. Bear
Creek is now rushing toward the Chilkat
River with a deafening roar, carrying
great mountain bowlders in its tremen
dous torrent. The most important bridge
in that section has been washed out. It
crossed the Chilkat River at the mouth
of Rose Creek and was used by all min
ers going and coming.
The river is now being crossed on three
poles laid end to end. and held. In place
with ropes. The bridge will-be replaced
as soon as "the* water subsides by 4 de
tachment of soldiers sent from Skaguay
to preserve peace among the, Chilkat In
dians. Only seven miners are now camp
ed along Bear Creek in place of several
score who Intended working there this
summer. The mining was commenced in
June, but had only been started when the
spring freshets began. It was supposed
these would subside in^Jnly. but the hot
weather has increased ' their volunje.
John Cook and Thomas Becker nearly
destroyed their eyesight on Bear Creek.
A cartridge exploded while they were ex
perimenting with a new gun. The pow
der "burned their eyes badly and Becker
will lose the sight of one eye.
Conditions Surrounding Locked-O v ut Team

THE SAjST OT
Employers of Ironworkers Say the Men Can
\X Return to Work, but Under Coriditions
Existing Before the Present Trouble
toflÂ«rfHE coriditions surrounding "the
I conflict* between the locked out
i teamsters and the Draymen's As
il sociation were not changed by any
â¢ action trken by the union or the
employers yesterdaj'. Both sides claim
that victory Is slowly but surely coming
to them, while disinterested people con
tend that the present agitation is but a
smoldering fire that may at any moment
break out into Â«. conflagration of startling
proportions. Upon the' shoulders of the
members' of the City Front Federation
rests the responsibility of ending.the
conflict or of making the present difficulty
the cause of a mighty struggle between
men of almost every, craft in- this city and
the men by whom they are employed.
The threatened walk-out of the afllllateo
unions did not occur yesterday morning,
and the enthusiasm formerly displayed by
the strikers became discontent. The meet
ings were all lengthy and etormy.
A walk-out of the City Front Federation
is expected, and the men of the affiliated
unions appear jubilant at the idea of the
support the strike of 16.000 men composing
the federation will afford the movement.
They wanted immediate action on the part
of the affiliated unions of the water front.
Delay of a Day.
To the heads of the various unions the
delay of a day in ordering out the 16,000
men meant a possible chance to win with
out forcing an issue.
At the meeting of the Federation Sat
urday night, after a long, stormy session
it was decided to defer ordering a general
strike until after its meeting to-night- The
leaders were very reticent about the views
expressed by the members and stated that
they preferred withholding a knowledge ot
their intended action from the public until
oortain conferences which were being ar
ranged for could be held. Upon the result
of these conferences, said the leaders,
they would base their course. They said
further that at to-night's meeting the
matter would be settled one way or the
other. . .
' The news of the stand taken by the
Federation was spread throughout the
ranks of the laboring men Saturday night.
The delegates to the City Front Federa
tion visited the unions at their meeting
places and until the early, hours of the
morning urged them to stand firm, plead
ing that a day'6 delay could do no harm.
. At the headauarters Â¦ of the teamsters,
.at â¬72 Fourth street, everything was quiet
yesterday. The men gathered in knots
â¢and discussed the situation. They seemed
full of hope and assured inquirers that the
teamsters .were "standing pat" and would
â¢not budge an iuch from the stand taken
Â¦by them." â¢ â¢ .- . i- '\
Business Agent Casey and Secretary Mc>
I,aughlin of the union appeared among the
men early In the day and remained until
late In the afternoon. - They advised the,
men constantly to refrain from violence.
They also assured the men that ample
support was - forthcoming and that.theii
fight was a winning one.
The meeting of the Porters,' Packers and
Warehousemen yesterday was a lively
one. The action of the bosses in discharg
ing more than 100 members of the union
becauKG they were members of a labor or
ganization was discussed. That a genera
: strike o,f the members was' not advisee
was due to a. desire to await the actior
of the City Front Federation, though ii
is possible that the employers will an
ticipate the demands of the federation and
discharge the remaining members of th<
union to-day. Â¦ â¢ V.
Out at the Union Iron Works as well as
at the Rlsdon and the Fulton Iron Works,
business is anything but at a standstill.
Since the inception of the. iron workers'
strike the places of the strikers have been
gradually filled with new men,, until now
there are 1100 machinists employed in the
works. Among : the number may . be seen
the faces of a few of the old hands, but
in the main the latter are conspicuous by
their absence. Many of those . who have
applied for work during the strike came
from the country. These men will be re
tained after the strike is settled.
. At the Risdon Iron Works \ about 600
men have been given employment.
James Spiers, president of - the Fulton
Engineering and Shipbuilding. Works, said
last night that the situation as far as the
employers are concerned could not have a
more promising aspect, He , said: Â¦
"We are willing and have always been
willing to meet our men when they- come
to us individually. At the Fulton Iron
Works we now have 110 men at work.
Whan Â¦ the strike was commenced^ we
were employing 600 men and paying them
good wages. While the othe,r iron works
are taking their machinists back at the
former schedule of wages and hours we
are offering a special inducement, in that
we provide our. men with their vboard.
But few of the old hands have, straggled
back and for the most part our present
force is composed of raw recruits."- .
A joint meeting of the Journeymen-
Barbers and the Master Barbers will be
held to-night at 32 O'Farrell street. A

will be had and after, that a banquet will
be given In. honor of the State Board. of
Barber Examiners. '.
Secretary Rosenberg of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council was a busy, man all

ings and argued a conciliatory policy. He

Asks for Police Protection.
Nick Aronson, a teamster employed by
"McNab & Smith, called at the central po
lice station and asked for police protec
tion. He said that he came, from .Kes
wick and started to work on Saturday
morning.- That night, after leaving the
firm's barn to go to his room on Mission
street, he was followed by about 200
striking" teamsters, who threw rocks at
him. He had a revolver in his pocket,
and, fearing for his life, he faced the
crowd, which was coming too close to him
â¢to be comfortable , and fired a shot among
them. scattered and he was left in
peace. * Aronson . said he did not; know
whether his -Â«hot ? took effect or not. but
he . fired * with the intention of hitting
some one. Lieutenant Martin told him to
be at the oentral station at 7>o'clock this
morning, when other teamsters who had
been intimidated would be there to receive
police escort to the barns. V \" :

TWO FAMILIES
IN FATAL DUEL
Fathers and Sons Line
Up in a Desperate
Battle.
MEMPHIS. Tenn., July 28.â Edwin Bla
lock, dead with a rifle ball through n;3
brain; M. F. Blalock, leg broken by a bul
let; Robert Wright 8r., leg broken by bul
lets; Robert Wright, Jr.,- a fugitive from
justice.
Such is the result of a desperate duel
with rifles which occurred about dusk to
night on Norris avenue, south of the city.
and near Forest Hill Cemetery. The trag
edy grew out of a dispute between Robf rt
Wright Jr. and Edwin Blalock. Tl>e
fathers backed the boys up and the two
families lined up with rifles. When with
in a few yards of each other the first shot
was fired. Then sharp and quick came
the other shots.
Almost with the first one from the side
of the Wrights young Blalock fell with
a rifle ball through his brain. His v broth
er Fred picked up his rifle and v stood
where his brother had fallen.
Finally the elder Wright had to be taken
off the battle ground with a bullet in his
leg and Blalock injured almost in the
same way was carried Into his house. The
two young men shot a few times at eich
other as they retreated," each toward his
own home.
Robert Wright Jr. and. Ed win Blalcck.
the dead boy. had a slight quarrel.
Wright, it Is said, told it around that he
had given Blalock a black eye. From
this to-night's tragedy resulted.

following resolutions adopted yesterday, a copy being ordered sent to the Mayor: ; :.., ;
WHEREAS, An oreanization styling itself '. "The Em

There are two classes of draymen in

When asked If he thought Senator

that It was rather doubtful on account
of the relations existing - at present be

friendly. He said that during the dead-
Jock 'session Oxnard was mentioned
among others as an available man :*or the

Bacon, the new candidate for the Sena

1 * Oxnard, tho noted beet-sugar
II 'grower and refiner, aspires to
';'*' -^ wear a Senatorial toga; and it Is
said he intends to enter the race
against ! Senator | Perkins. . The manage
ment of his campaign in the south Is re
ported to ' have < been placed in the hands
of Walter; R.* Bacon. Some of Bacon's
statements are significant.
' "While I have received no intimation
from Â¦ Mr.' j Oxnard or any of his friends
that he is or intends to become a candi
date for the United States Senate," said
Bacon, ..'.Twill' say that he is one of the
brightest : men in California and .would
certainly make an excellent SÂ«nator. x Mr.
Oxnard is a personal friend of mine, but
I have not r had a conversation with him
for the past j six months and certainly
have not been asked to become his politi
cal j sponsor. â¢ Â¦ ,
â¢ "If Mr. Oxnard intends to make a fight
for the Senatorship j this would certainly
be the right'time to begin. I think any
good- and strong man I can + give Senator
Perkins a hard fight and maybe defeat
him. - There 'are â¢ various divisions of the
Republican political forces at the present
time, "but If there were an active candi
date in the field he would draw a lot of
strength from the various forces.
;',"I think Senator Perkins can beMefeat
ed,. for there has been such a sharp divi
sion ! of factions that i he has been forced
to attempt to satisfy both in the distribu
tion of patronage. Perkins is a good poli
tician, and has nearer than most
men could in this tttempt to conciliate all
parties.' Still, he-has been in office a long
time and, of course, has made enemies.
Then, again, people like a change." .
"Would the men who supported Grant
in the campaign you managed- support
Oxnard?" was asked.
"Now, I don't, know that Oxnard is a
candidate," he replied, "but a great many
of those who supported Grant will sup
port I any active candidate In opposition
to Perkins-: : There is no well-defined di
vision of the politicians who were In that

Discuss the Situation. .
Secretary Williams was found at his home
. this evening. He admitted he had been
with President "Shaffer in New Tork and
met Morgan. He would not say, what had
taken place .there," having been pledged to
' secrecy. Asked whether the terms printed
"I In' the morning papers covered the situa

that a meeting of the executive board has
been called for Tuesday.-. .
1 Additional information regarding the
New York meeting of the Industrial lead-
I era was afterward picked up from reliable
j sources. It was state- that the two
I Amalgamated officers left Pittsburg on
I Friday night and when they arrived in
I New York, went direct to the private ol
j flee of Morgan. The, meeting between thii
Pittsburg men and Morgan lasted front
I about 11 o'clock in the morning until Â¦$
o'clock in the afternoon. At no time did
the conference adjourn to the offices of
the United States Steel Corporation. . Dur
ing the conference President Schwab and
Judge E. H. Gary were present most of
the time. Another "conferee was Adams,
one of Morgan's partners. The Amalga
mated officials directed their, attention
almost entirely to Morgan and President
Schwab. They went over the grounds on
which the strike began, and discussed a
settlement basis. After exchanging views
with the' steel officials Shaffer and Will
iams left the office.
Believe Strike Is Nearly Ended.
In explanation of the hurried trip of the
two officers to New York, It was said that
until nearly 5 In the afternoon neither of
the officers knew they would be required
to leave Pittsburgh Prior to that time
Colonel George* B.- Harvey,, maun seer of
Harvey Bros. z the -New York publishers,
was a caller at the. office of President
Shaffer. When Colonel Harvey left the In
vitation to go to 'New, York had been.ex
tended and had boon accepted. It was pos
itively stated that the mooting between
tho heads of the Amalgamated Aiwocla

The first brewery of Jos.
Schlitz was a hut, but the
beer that was brewed there
was honest. That was fifty
years ago. Today the mag-
nificent Schlitz brewery
forms a monument to that
honesty.
From the very beginning
the main object has been to
attain absolute, purity. In
Schlitz beer pure yeast was
first introduced in America.
In the Schlitz brewery are
all the inventions men have
made for protecting beer
from impurities.
Schlitz beer is even cooled
in filtered air; then it is fil-

well aged to avoid the cause
of biliousness.

â¢ For. a long time there has been a standing joke that
New Jersey is not in the Union, but if it be true'that
herdudes have been playing, golf by. electric light; it
will be' time, to .quit jesting. Such enterprise shouldn't
be mocked even by indirection. ' , ,
Although the : djate 'of the coronation of King Ed

An Illinois pastor has hit upon an ingenious plan
to keep sleepy members of his flock awake during
the sermons;\ He pays two little girls a cent apiece
for every person they awaken. Perhaps he believes
that men should rÂ«sist slumber under even 1 the most
adverse conditions.
A New Jersey girl sued her employer for wages
due, but when asked on the witness-stand to give her
age she said she was 20,, and thereupon the counsel
for the defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground
that the plaintiff .was a self-confessed infant and had
no standing in court. Her attorney offered to prove
that she was at least 23, but an intimation of a prose
cution for perjury caused him to drop his offer; so
the next time that young lady goes into court she
will have sense enough to tell her age rightly.
It will be remembered that in the reports of. the sea
fight off, Santiago it was stated that Schley's ship, the
Brooklyn,- inflicted 58 per. cent of the damage done to
the Spanish fleet and suffered 54 per cent of the dam
age done to the American fleet; and if the reports were
true Schley should attach the Brooklyn to his answer
to the investigating committee as "Exhibit. A" and
let it go at that.
That phase of his character was well illustrated by
his recent manifesto in which he mocked at the in
effectual efforts; of the Liberal leaders to organize an
opposition to the present Government or evento for r
mulate a policy, on which the party, can or. will agree.
He described the recent action of the Liberal party
in giving a vote Jof confidence toCampbell-Bannerman
as an act of "organized. 1 hypocrisy," and declared such
an attitude" on the part of the Liberals is as dangerous
That description does not sound anything like
Bryan beyond the oratorical feature. Bryan. certainly
could not have been.the wisest of boys, nor has any
one ever noted in him a dislike to the dust. In fact,
he is so fond of agitation and demagogic strife that it
is quite likely he prefers the dust to the palmi It
affords, however, a very fair ground from which to
estimate Rosebery as a man and , a leader.; He has
retired from politics seemingly from no other reason
than a dislike to share in th e. give and take of the
struggle. He would of course like to be Prime Min
uter of Great Britain, but he is not willing to fight
for the place. Unless he can be absolute dictator arid
have everything go smoothly his way he will stay
outside and find fault with those who are doing; the
work. '
So great is the popular interest in Rosebery and his
present attitude toward politics that the British have
begun to study him from his childhood up. Thus
they have gone, back to his schooldays and sought
out the estimate that \- was placed upon him by his
teachers. One of them, who was Rosebery's tutor
at Eton, is reported to have written of him: "He
has the finest combination of qualities I have ever
seen. He will be an orator and, if not a poet, such
a man as poets delight in. He must be the wisest
boy that ever lived. But one thing is lacking. He
is one of those who like the palm without the dust."
WITHIN the field of British politics Lord
Rosebery has become as much of an issue as
Bryan is in American politics. In their na
ture, however, the two issues differ widely. In this
country the demoralized Democrats are doing their
best to get rid of their old leader, while in Great
Britain the demoralized Liberals are trying to coax
Rosebery back. The "one man is an issue because' he
persists that his party shall hold fast to bygone poli
cies, while the other is an issue because he will sug
gest no policy at'all, but stand aside and criticize
everything and everybody.

The strike has interfered with business in San Fran
cisco during the week. A good deal of produce, such
as* fruit, potatoes, etc., which would otherwise have
come here, has been shipped out from interior points
or diverted to interior canneries. Prices for fruit are
very stiff and pointing upward, and fine table fruit
has been scarce in this market for some days.. Mer
chandise has felt the strike severely, as the reception
and shipment of goods has been seriously retarded.
This is an extrinsic condition, however, and does not
in any way indicate any lassitude in trade per se.- Our
agricultural and commercial conditions 'are* all right,
and the loss to business -on account of the strike is
temporary.
, Wool maintains the improvement'alrcady noted, and
in the Eastern markets the demand from manufac
turers to fill orders for winter and spring wear is
brisk. The San Francisco market is well cleaned up
of raw wools, both fine and coarse. The consumptive
demand for boots and shoes is still good, and some
increase is reported. The iron and steel mills not
affected by the strike report exceptional activity, par
ticularly for railway cars, structural material, builders'
hardware, steel bars for farming implements, etc.,
showing that construction of all sorts is active
throughout the country- In fact, building is lively,
and white pine lumber, like iron and steel products,
is active for this account. '
The business of the country as a whole, however,
according to the weekly bank clearings, was 56.6 per
cent larger than during the same week last year, and
all the leading cities except St. Paul showed a gain.
The increase at New York was large, amounting to
82.5 per cent. The- distributive trade of the country,
outside the States mentioned above, was very fair,
and the West was in the market for additional sup
plies of hot-weather goods. The staples showed more
tendency to fluctuate than for a long time, principally
on account of the weather. Produce, particularly but
ler, eggs and vegetables, advanced in the Eastern
cities, while the calls of the West for fresh and canned
fruit stimulated both of these descriptions and caused
an advance in prices. Large shipments of fruit to the
West were made from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
Baltimore reported a marked rise in canned
corn, tomatoes and other lines of canned food. In
California there was a general advance in canning
plums, pears and peaches, owing chiefly to the im
pairment of the Eastern and Western fruit crops by
the intense neat and drought of the past six weeks;
and dried fruits also showed some stimulation on this
account. The drought in the West will make a good
many lines of farm produce higher during the coming
fall, and, as will be seen, the advance has already
set in.
The effect of this was especially apparent in Wall
street. The prospect for a greatly reduced yield of
corn led to the belief that the fall earnings of many
of the larg(?st Southwestern raihoads would be im
paired and that the dividends would suffer in conse
quence. Public interest flagged, speculators took the
short side of the market, and there was a general de
crease in the volume of sales. During the early part
of the week there was a sharp decline, but toward
the close the feeling became firmer again.

THE WEATHER AND BUSINESS.
Never before in American history has a political
leader been so discredited as Bryan. Of him it may
be truly said he rose like a rocket and came down
like a stick. He no longer has any support as a
Presidential candidate, and it is questionable if he can
much longer retain much patronage as the editor of
the Commoner.
It is not from the South only that such declarations
come. The Albany Argus says : ' "The process which
might be .better called rehabilitation than reorganiza
tion is quietly doing its work all over the country,
and the Ohio convention is. merely a' sort of first
fruits or visible evidence of the practical unanimity of
the Democratic party indemanding^that^dead issues
and disastrous alliances be dropped." The Boston
Post says: "In refusing to reaffirm thcKansas City
platform or to express continued confidence in Mr.
Bryan, the Ohio Democrats, have set a good ex
ample to the party throughout the country."
Practical politicians among the Democrats are say
ing much the same as the Democratic press. Thus"
in Pennsylvania, where there is to be a Democratic
State convention en August 15, .it is accounted as cer
tain that the Ohio lead will be followed. One of the
members of the Democratic State : Committee when
questioned about the situation answered by saying,
"There is no political situation this year." Others,
however, have been more outspoken, and made it
clear that the Kansas City platform will not be again
indorsed by Pennsylvania Democrats. v
The Richmond Times is more severe. It con
demns the silver leader as well as the silver platform,
and saysf "Mr. Fryan's leadership has not only been
a flat failure, but it has cost the Democratic party
almost its existence. Mr. Bryan has done about as
much as any one man could do to disrupt the party
and destroy its organization. It" was largely through
his influence that the party formed an alliance with
Populists and Free Silver Republicans, and it was
Mr. Bryan's idea to drive away from the party all
Democrats who were opposed to. his peculiar doc
trines, and then to form a new party of all sorts and
conditions of men who believed in Bryanism."
, The Memphis Commercial Appeal hails the Ohio
platform as something in the nature of political sal
vation. It says: , "The Ohio Democracy records its
weariness of failure and defeat. It turns its back upon
free silver as a dead issue. It breaks away from a
leadership which, honorable and well meaning as it
has been, has brought the Democratic party to a cori
dition of nerveless disintegration."
AMPLE time has now been given for the rad
ical Bryanites to recover from- the blow dealt
them by the Democratic convention in Ohio,
but with the exception of a feeble and futile attempt
to organize a bolt in that State they have shown no
signs; of fighting back. * Oh the other hand, from' all
partfc of the Union come reports of Democratic com
mendation of what was done* in Ohio. Many papers
speak kindly of Bryan himself, but for Bryanism they
have nothing to say in the way of approval and very
little in the way of excuse. '

wearisome . Sampson-Schley controversy, we need onfy * insist
on proper punishment for this- Maclay who used viperous
language not' found at all In the' Sampson' report.
COIiTJDtBTTS (OHIO) PBESS-POST.
No officer In the service has dared to say openly what the
bureau clique have Inspired Irresponsible â¢writers to utter
against Schley, and Maclay, though he is carried on the navy
yard payroll, is not within the range of a naval court.
PHILADELPHIA TIMES.
Is thisi fellow Maclay going to be permitted to further dis
grace tte service of the United States by remaining in it, even,
as a laborer? The navy ring which used him, as an instrument
to defame a gallant officer of the navy should be compelled
to support him.

The fact that the Brooklyn inflicted 58 per cent of the Injury
done to the Spanish cruisers and suffered 54 per cent of .the
punishment inflicted upon the American fleet should make any
inquiry unnecessary, but persistent misrepresentation calls for
a final adjudication.
PITTSBTJRG DISPATCH.
If any cowardice was shown no one will ever make thÂ»
American people believ9 that a vestige of it waa displayed by
Schley. Schley has proved himself not only a brave but a
strong man, and every attack on him does nothing more than
elevate him in the public's regard.
CINCINNATI POST.
His book not only assumes to be an exhaustive and direct
study of reports and other original sources, but It has excel
lent sponsorship and good acceptance. At the same time it 13
useless to attempt to link anybody connected with the Gov
ernment with the responsibility for the charges.
NEW YORK MAXL AND EXPRESS.
1 It is rot creditable to the department that the adoption of
such a book was sanctioned, whether Inadvertently or with
connivance of one or more subordinates, and Secretary Long,
while he has lost no time in stopping the wrong, has perhaps
not yet done all that is necessary to do In the case.
NEW YORK TRIBUNE.
He accuses him of actions "most humiliating, cowardly and
contemptible." Whatever substance of truth there lies behind
this, it | can scarcely be sufficient to warrant stigmatizing
Schley, who had shown himself a man of spirit and gallantry,
as well as a skillful officer, on many occasions, as a coward.

The Secretary also contradicts the published statement of

upon Admiral Schley in advance of publication.
Speaking of his own views upon the issues of the

of the war against the Boers, but avowed a decided
antagonism to the methods and tactics of the; Min
isters. Under the circumstances he declared he would
have to, walk. apart from. political organizations and
"plow his furrow atone,": but he added significantly
that perhaps before he got to the end of the furrow
he might find he .was not alone. It appears from that
statement, that he is, bidding^or a following which
will give him absolute , leadership. In other words,

pire. r ' â¢ ; t *\r â¢ ' 'â¢ ' . â¢' * .H**
There has been a. good fdeal of 'speculation as to'
what Rosebery means to ( .do.V He himself: has spoken
updn^the subject in but a dubious way." : Still it would
seem he is dissatisfied not only with the .present lead
ership of the Liberals but with the. party itself. In a'
recent- address he is quoted as saying that no man
now living can remember; in Great Britain another
Government which had crowded into its administra
tion such an assemblage of error, weakness and
wholesale blunders as the present one, and that the
failures of i the : Government should be" the oppor
tunity of the -opposition. He added that if the Lib
erals did not undertake the task another, party would
be created- for the purpose.
Under the primary election law there can be none
of the fraud or force by which Kelly and others like
him have, in times past, defeated the will of the party.
In this" election every vote will be counted. The bosses
will, of course, carry as many heelers and toughs into
the primaries as they can manage to pass off as Re
publicans, but there will not be enough of them to
turn the tide if the true Republicans of the city attend
to their political duties. The issue is, therefore, one
in which we may say with Lieutenant Governor
Northcott: "He who strives for the elevation and
purification of the Government is as much a patriot as
he who shoulders a musket in the defense of the na
tion."
To oppose the banded bosses the better elements
of the Republican party have organized and are fight
ing in the interests of the city and of its people. The
Republican Primary League is pledged to no particu
lar candidate, nor is it antagonistic to any. It seeks
only to bring out the full vote of the party at the
primaries so that the delegates elected to the nomina
ting convention will be thoroughly representative of
the party. A victory for the league at the primaries
will mean an honest convention, an honest ticket and
an honest city government. It is therefore a victory
for whose accomplishment every stalwart and genuine
Republican should work and vote.
The appeal then addresses itself directly to the civic
patriotism of the rank and file of the Republican party."
In this contest the question whether we are to have
good government or bad is to be determined by Re
publicans. That much is recognized by the bosses
themselves and by the whole predatory class of politi
cians. They have united and are fighting with all the
energy of men who see spoils in sight.' To Â¦ Kelly's
aid Gage has brought the State machine, and Herrin,
in defiance of the orders of President Hays, is trying
once more to swing the Southern Pacific Railroad in
the old way. Each of the leaders in the combination
hopes to make a personal profit out of the victory if
it be gained, and most of their hungry following of
taxeaters have also hopes of sharing in the spoils. It
is a ravenous crowd that seeks to capture San Fran
cisco and divide the loot.
In the present political situation if is not too much
to say that the task of preserving the city from boss
rule depends. upon the better elem'ent of the Republi
can party. Democracy, discredited and demoralized,
will hardly be able to do anything to redeem itself.
It is to the Republican party, therefore, that inde
pendent voters and taxpayers look for the nomination
of a ticket that will have the confidence of good men
and assure the community of economy, honesty and
efficiency in the administration of public affairs. If
that expectation be disappointed the Republicans
might as well abandon the contest, for independent
voters, and, indeed, many stanch and true Republi
cans, will not support a ticket nominated under the
domination of Kelly and Herrin.
That warning and invocation comes as pertinent
and as timely to the people of San Francisco as to
the members of the bar of Illinois. In the approach
ing municipal election it is to be determined how our
local laws are to be made and how' our city govern
ment is lo be carried on. The issue will be deter
mined "largely by the tesult of the primaries. If good
citizens remain away from* the polls and the bosses
get control of the nominating conventions, then good
citizens will have no ether option than that of ratify
ing the choice of one of two party bosses, and we shall
have in our municipal affairs a repetition of all the old
inefficiency, corruption and dishonesty that have con
stituted the basis of so many scandals in the past.
B'EFORE the Illinois Bar Association, at its re
cent meeting, Lieutenant -Governor. Northcott
of that State, io reported to ha\x said in" the
course of^n address on "How Laws Are Made": *'I
want to say to you, iry brothers, that unless- we. go
to the rescue of the Goverrtrnent the political future
is very' dark. Don't Â¦ be satisfied with .going to the
polls and voting to ratify the choice of either one of
the two party bosses. The citizens of. this country
must interest themselves in politics. He who' strives
for the elevation and purification of the Government
is as much a patriot as he who shoulders a musket in
the defense of the nation."

dragged herself ta the door of the resi
dence of A. H. Vail of the firm of San
born, Vail & Co.. at 2213 Webster street,
begged for a phuÂ«s of milk and died a
ehort time afterward In convulsions.
Dr. Herzog of the Lane Hospital, who
was called by the Vail family, arrived
shortly before the woman breathed her
last and expressed his opinion that ar
senic poisoning had brought death. In
view of the mysterious features of the
case Coroner's Deputies Meehan and Don
ahue made an investigation. They found
that last evening Mrs. Cohn, who is the
mother of four children and resides at 1812
Webster street, announced her intention
of remaining at home and. her husband
went downtown. Later she concluded to
take a â¢ walk and passed down Webster
street alone. As she approached the Vail
residence, four blocks distant, she was
observed to falter and stagger. She
climbed the stairs with difficulty and
when the door was opened,* entered and
begged for a glass of milk, saying she was
ill. The Vails did not know their visitor,
but did everything possible for her relief.
Thinking whisky would revive her, they
gave her some and then .telephoned for
Dr. Herzog. Before the physician ar
rived the patient had convulsions and be
came unconscious. -
What caused Mrs. Cohn's death is a
mystery. . The doctor saya he detected
symptoms of arsenic poisoning. The re
quest of the woman for milk and the con

tending to the belief that poison played
a part In the case. Cohn says that his
wife had, been ill for some time and that
her heart was affected. .

Whenever such prayers are offered up, when
ever we petition Almighty God for. rain, when
ever we pray to him to avert the storm or Tho
hurricane. Â¦ a number of half-fledged scientists
rise up to rebuke us. They cry out, supersti
tion t They 1 say that such prayers are worse
than useless. They claim that science has de
monstrated the folly of them, that science has
shown that the world is governed by natural
laws with which God dare not Interfere.
They have noted certain facts or phenomena
hvthe physical world. They have studied and
compared these facts and discovered that they
are subservient to certain order. This order
Is what we commonly call natural law. Tho
scientist does not look beyond that law. He
will explain and account for everything ao
cording to It. He will deny any outside in
telligence regulating, governing or dliectlng
tha laws of nature.
Such Is the argument of the scientists. They
can trace cause and effect for a certain dis
tance, but there they must stop. They cannot
analyze the infinite, they cannot classify Divine
intelligence according to any of their laws;
they cannot weigh him In their balance or ex
amine him beneath their microscope. Rut back
of all natural law. is God. Listen to the great
scientists on the subject. Sir Isaac Newton de
clared that natural philosophy without God was
an Impossibility. Lord Kelvin wrote that
"overpowering proofs of Intelligence and
benevolent design He around us showing us
through nature the Influence of a free will and
teaching us that all living beings depend upon
one ever-actinsr Creator and Ruler." Note his
words. "Thfi Influence of a free will" is still
manifest.. "Living beings depend upon one
ever-actlng Creator and Ruler." Professors
Stewart and Talt write that "we assume as
absolutely self-evident the existence of a Deity
who' la the Creator and Ruler of all things."
Not merely Creator, mind you, but also nuler.
God,' who created the universe, who instituted
the laws of nature, did not hurl that universe
Into space without any further thought of It
nor did he place those laws outMde his control.
They are still subject .to him. They are his to
change or to suspend.
God Not a Machine.
God Is a person with free will. He Is not a
machine. lie 1b not subject to the laws which
he has made. He made those laws and he Tina
not surrendered tho government of them. He
Is our Father, all-wise, all-loving, all-power
ful. He wishes that we should ask for what we
need and he has promised to grant our petitions.
He even makes the granting ot the favor de
pend on our asking. He has so told us by his
Divine Bon. When nffllctlon visits us ho de
sires that we should petition him to remove it.
When his hand presses upon us he waits until
we lift ur> voice ot prayer tn him. He has
fashioned hla eternal decree ao aa to take ac
count of tho prayers of his children.
In tha harmony of creation, prayer holds t\
conspicuous place. It It one of the great force*
of the world.

and enUsrhtened editor could not brook such
dark and lamentable superstition. Ho must
needs lift up his voice In protest. In choice
language he brands such prayers as '.'an occu
pation for Darkest Africa." He places those
who presume to nsk Almighty God for tem
poral favora on a level with the African sav
age. He hears cheap and vulgar ridicule on
them. He insults the faith and Intelligence,
not only of those who turn to Ood In their
hour of affliction, but of all who believe In a
divine providence. What right has he to con
demn the religious practices of Christian peo
ple? Which of the prophets Is he that he
should stt In Judgment on the faith and tra
ditions â¢ of. tho Christian ages? Th;s Insult,
for Insult it is. should not go unrebuked and
Ihe editor in question should be taught to re
spect the rellclous beliefs and intelligence of
his readers.

TVy 1 5v y i t yvi l SÂ»In the absence of Commodora W. N. Mc-
Carthy and â¢ the flagship Eamona, the
command of the fleet devolved on Vice
Commodore R. S. Bridgman. Colors were
made at 8 o'clock yesterday morning and
later the signal "glad to see you aboard"
was set on the sloop Thetis. Shortly after
10 o'clock the yachts made sail, took their
small boats aboard and cruised down to
the, starting: line between the gangway of
the receiving ship Independence and the
sloop Catherine, from which the time was
taken. At 10:30 the yachts In class 1 were
still some little distance from the starting
line, and the first of them, the sloop
Thetis, did not cross until a minute or two
after 10:40, "the limit for the class. The
wind was light at starting, but out In San
Pablo Bay freshened to a fair sailing
breeze, with smooth water. All except
the yawl Tramontana and the sloop Nixie
kept well off the Contra Costa shore. Off
McNears Landing the breeze became very
strong, and a heavy sea was running", but
in Raccoon Straits the wind fell lighter.
In class 1 there were three starters, Paul
de Martini's sloop Siren proving an easy
winner from Rl S. Bridgman's sloop Thet
is, and the yawl Royal being distanced.
The sloop Surprise reached Vallejo on
Saturday after a four days' trip to Napa.
and started down with the fleet, but was
distanced. In class 2 the sloop Nixie beat
the yawl Tramontana by nearly four min
utes. Corrected time, though, the yawl
first. The sloop Nixie won the
flag in class 2, and the sloop Siren In
class 1. The full details are shown In the

assumed the. defensive first, with L. W.
Robitaille , and : H. G. Macartney, the
former being bowled for one run and the
latter scoring 17 : runs. H. R. Elliott made
the stand of the'day, being not out for 69.

Santa. Cruz' sent, Jenkins and Bowley to
the bat, the former making: 13 and the
latter 10. Then Howard and Sloman got
together, Â¦ the former retiring after mak
ing. 41 and the latter being caught when
he had made the same number. P. D. Gel

SEASIDE CRICKETERS WIN TWO OF THE CLOSEST
, AND MOST EXCITING MATCHES OF, THE SEASON
SOME OF TJHE CRICKET- PLAYERS IN ACTION.
In the opening course For Freedom led
Brutus ten lengths and won out. He was
beaten by the stake winner in the- third
round. The new dog, Bright Gold, did
not show to advantage and failed to
score against Dewdrop.
Tyrone Prince, after knocking at the
door for some time past, got his name
on the big list by winning the deciding
round of the Reserve stake from Tapioca.
Tho dogs ran a no go, after which the
Prince got the flag by a clean score.
Narcissus, the stake favorite, went out
to Tapioca in the fourth round. The tal
ent made a strong play on him at 5 to 3,
but was disappointed. Quite a few of
the contestants were victims of the well
trained and lively hares and had to be'
withdrawn. Rocker ran in his old-time
lorm and reached the fifth round, where
he retired in favor of John Doe. In the
third round he beat Black Flush, a 5 to 4
favorite, and followed by outpointing Fon
tenoy, who was held the choice at 5 to 3.
Sleigh Bells beat First Foot 3. to 1 and
at the same odds. Tapioca took the de
cision from For Glory. Sweet Emma at
7 to 2 outpointed King Cotton. Castaway

Lucky Dr. Moskiman was not good yes
terday. The Sacramento stick swingers
Tell upon him with dire results and In the
seventh inning Youngey Johnson as the
relief force bared his right arm and did
the twirling. It was a bad omen, al
though Johnson pitched well. The unre
liable Dudes broke into pieces and the
Senators cantered home for certain and
undisturbed victory.
Sacramento played a good game from
beginning to end.
Bill Devereaux, otherwise known as
"Red Dop." was on the slab for the Sen

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 14, Sacramento 2.
Thomas was an easy mark for the
Dudes at Oakland yesterday , morning.
They pounded everything he sent over the
plate. "When the scorer added up the to
tals at the end of the game Oakland was
on the large end, the result being 14 to 2.
The Dudes obtained twelve â¢ soft hits,
Â¦K-Mle their opponents were kept down to
three. Oakland also played a perfect
fielding game, not an error being regis
tered against " the Brummels.
Streib distinguished himself by getting
a home run, a three-bagger and two sin
gles. Babbitt and Moskiman were very
effective, and had the Senators entirely
at their mercy. Carter was put In to
catch In Stanley's place, the Dudes cele
brating the event by stealing eight baseg.
Sacramento did not have a chance to win,
playing a very loose fielding game. Fol
lowing is the score: . .

Falling hair is caused by dandruff,
which la a germ disease. The germ in bur-
rowing into the roct of the hair, where it
destroys the vitality of the hair, causing
the hair to fall out. digs up the cuticle in
little scales, called dandruff or scurf. You
can't etop the falling hair â¢without curing
the dandruff, and you can't cure the dan-
druff without killing the dandruff germ.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the ef-
fect." JCewbro'e Herpicide is the only
hair preparation that kills the dandruff
germ Herpidfle is also a delightful hair

Why is It our competitors fight and lay
more against the Ludwig ptano than any
other make? .Because they know that there
ia more real value In tha "Ludwig" than
any other piano. It ta the best piano for tha
money In the market. They know It We
know tt and you will know It when you *eÂ«
