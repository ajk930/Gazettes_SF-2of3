OLD MINER
IN A SHAFT
The""Ventura County voters passed an
ordinance under this law regulating the
sale of liquors. . An ordinance covering
liquor licenses and regularly passed by
the Board of Supervisors was In effect at
the same time. Anderson complied " with
the regular ordinance and violated . that
passed fcy the vote of the people. He
was Imprisoned and asked for his release
en the ground that the violated ordinance,
was unconstitutional. The Superior
Court denied his petition and the case
The law then provides that when a ma
jority of such votes are cast in favor of
the adoption of the proposed ordinance it
devolves upon the Board of Supervisors
to issue a proclamation to that effect, and
the ordinance is then legally recognized.'
Whenever there shall be presented to the
Board of Supervisors a petition or petitions
eigned by legal voters of said county, equal
In number to 50 per cent of the votes cast at th e
last preceding election, asking that an ordi
nance, to be set forth in such petition, be sub
mitted to a x-ote of qualified voters. It shall be
the duty of the Board of Supervisors by procla
mation to submit Â«uch proposed ordinance to
the vote of the qualified electors of such
county.
The several counties of this State as they now
exist are bodies corporate and politic, and as
each have the powers specified in this act and
such other powers aa are necessarily implied
â¢ â¢ â¢ their powers can only be exercised by
the Boards of Supervisors or by agents and
officer* acting' under their authority or author
ity of law.
An Unconstitutional Provision. ...
Subdivision 25 of section 25 of the same
act provides that Boards of Supervisors
can license all and any kinds of business
not prohibited by law for purposes of
regulation and revenue, and subdivision
SI of the same section gives to Boards of
Supervisors the right to make police,
sanitary and other necessary regulations.
Within the' same act the provision for
making laws by popular vote, which may
conflict with ordinances passed by the
Boards of Supervisors, is then made.
This provision, which has been declared
unconstitutional, is as follows:
In discussing the case the Supreme
Court quotes various sections of article
XI of the State constitution, which de
termines the law-making powers'of coun
ties. Section 1 of the county govern
ments act of 1S97 Is then quoted as fol
lows:
The question as to the constitutionality
of the act arose from the attempt of a
Ventura County liquor dealer, named
Anderson," to free himself by means of a
â¢writ of habeas corpus from the confine
ment in which he was placed for violat
ing an ordinance. He has secured his re
lease from. Jail and incidentally stirred
up a commotion of considerable propor
tions. <
While San Francisco was not a party
to the action, the Supreme Court decis
ion Is of vital interest to the people of
this city, inasmuch as It is practically a
ruling against the initiative and referen
dum and the clause in the new charter
providing for the acquisition of public
utilities by vote of the people.
TVith the single dissenting opinion of
Chief Justice Beatty. the Supreme Court
yesterday nullified section 13 of the
county governments act passed by {he
State Legislature in 1897. by which . - the
rlgfct of making' county laws was dele-.
pated directly to .the. voters. _By this de- v
dslon'the practice of the "Initiative and
referendum." In favor of which there Is
so great a popular clamor, has been
dealt a blow from which there Is little
hope of recovery so far as California is
concerned, while her present constitution
remains in force.
The. grand commanderies of the major
ity, of States reached here during the day.
The city was a scintillating glow of light
to-night when the festivities of the week
were begun at the Custom-house .With a
reception to Grand Encampment officers
and" ladies. Grand Commander Jefferson
of Kentucky made a brief speech of wel
come, to which" Grand Master Lloyd re
sponded happily, v *<Â£Â§S3i "
The selection of the next meeting place
for the conclave will be one of the last
things to come before the encampment.-
St. Paul. Milwaukee and San Francisco
are making strong bids for the honor.
Denver and- Cincinnati are also in line,
while St. Louis and various cities' of New
England are regarded as possibilities.
Bidding for Next Conclave.
Grand Generalissimo George M. Moulton
of Chicago stated to-night that the elec
tion of officers of the Grand Encampment
would undoubtedly be. the. usual perfunc
tory affair it has been for. years past.
Grand Master Lloyd will retire and bÂ»
succeeded by Deputy Grand Master Stod
dard of Texas'. Officers under him will
each advance one grade. This will leave
one vacancy to be - contested forâ the
Junior grand wardenship. A hot skirmish
is expected. In connection with this office
nearly . every grand commander at the
conclave is regarded as a candidate, and
a great deal of quiet electioneering: was
done to-day.
The various Kentucky commanderies
were divided Into detachments to-day,
and, accompanied in every instance by a
brass band, ', met incoming delegations at
the station and escorted them to their
quarters. Rain during the afternoon
drenched the draperies of the building*,
but they suffered no material damage
generally.
Incoming trains clogged the tracks
about the city throughout the day and by
midnight all but a few scattered com
manderies had arrived and been escorted
to their quarters. From ten to thirty
trains arrived over every railroad enter-"
in5 : the_city r and it is estimated that there
90,000 "visitors here to-nlghtl Hotels
and other '; places are crowded to tha
doors with guests, and visitors also oc
cupy steamboats moored at the wharves
and Pullman sleepers placed In different
parts of the city.
Ninety Thousand Visitors.
Major John H. Leathers, grand marshal
of the parade, stated to-night that In
formation received during ' the day led
him to expect 40,000 Sir Knights would be
in line when the procession moves. Tht3
pageant, as planned, will extend over a
route of four miles and will be the crown
ing glory of the conclave. Knights Tem
plar 1 from nearly every city gt the coun
try; Including, even Honolulu, will be la
line.
- The course of the parade Is a fluttering:
show of bunting, flags and streamers, and
nearly every one of them will* present to
the marchers some sign of welcome. Ex
traordinary precautions to keep the streets
clear have been adopted.

BALTIMORE, Aug. 26.â Cardinal Gib
bons reached home. this afternoon after a
tour of Europe and was received with'
open arms | by his friends and parishion
ers. When he alighted he was greeted by
a crowd of at least 10.000 people, headed by
Acting Mayor Henry .Williams and
Charles J. Bonaparte. The Cardinal dis
mounted from his' carriage and reviewed
the procession from the steps of the Cath
olic Club, opposite his residence, . after
which he addressed a congregation that
filled the cathedral to the doors. , . .
Cardinal Gibbons talked entertainingly
after the parade on conditions abroad. He
was much interested in the status of the
steel strike and said he hoped it would
be settled soon. When asked about the
relations between capital and labor in Eu
rcpe, he said: : . â¢- .
"That is an economic question, and I did
not study it. . I am not able to confirm or
deny the claims made that unions have
the* manufacturers in England so bound
down with their rules as to lessen the ca
pacity of the works with the result that
England is not able to compete with this
country in- many lines of trade. It would
take much study to learn all the details
of that subject. >
"We'were, â¢; however, struck with the
care taken to guard against accidents to
employes â¢ in England. Seemingly more
value is placed upon human life there than
here. > Rules are made by a Board of Com
missioners, and these are rigidly enforced.
In many instances employers take out in
surance on the lives of their hands. When
an employe Is permanently disabled he
must be paid his wages - for, â¢ I think,
three years.'.' . - , : - . Â¦
"Do you believe labor In this country is
better off than in England?" was asked.
."That, too," replied the Cardinal, "is a
subject for much Investigation. Condi
tion is, a relative term. There is more in
the. question than -wages alone.. One must

SAPULPA, I. T., Aug. 26.â The demon
strations against' the negroes came to a
sudden end with the arrival of Deputy
United States Marshal Bud Trail and Cap
tain White. They , were met here by
United States Marshal Bennett and Gov
ernor Porter, principal chief of the Creek
nation. Marshal Bennett instructed them
to arrest all offenders and send them to
Muskogee In chains and to deputize citi
zens if help was needed. He said he would
prevent an outbreak if he had to order
troops from Fort Gibson. Mayor Miller
Issued a'" firm proclamation commanding
the citizens' committee to | stop posting
notices. This was the result of a severe
reprimand from the , Federal authorities
for a proclamation of Saturday. The
deputy marshals have sworn in men for
service to-night, but all Is quiet and no
trouble is expected. Nearly all the negroes
not owning property, have left town. Mar
shals have torn down the warnings of ths
committee, including a lot- posted last
night.".
The published statement that politics
caused the trouble is not. substantiated: -
"I always considered the Franco-Rus
sian alliance exceedingly useful and fruit
ful to our country. I thought the mo
ment opportune to obtain the Czar's
presence at the maneuvers. We first in
tended inviting him to the western ma
neuvers, which are of greater Importance,
but the Czar preferred the eastern."
Asked whether the Czar himself sug
gested the visit, Loubet raplied: "Such
visits are not decided on without a-pre
vious exchange of views, which have been
proceeding" for some time.- I personally,
inspired the - negotiations .which led to
the result now known. When I learned
that the Czar intended to review the Ger
man fleet in the Baltic I deemed it more
important than ever to-secure a visit to
France, and I myself, with- the co-opera
tion of M. Delcasse, prepared this ' great
event," for which the negotiations wero
pursued with the greatest secrecy"." :.
Loubet Is further reported as-. saying
that, thanks to the Franco-Russian alli
ance, war was averted with China, and
that also up to now the programme of the
journey accepted by. the Russian Chancel
lor does not include a visit to Paris. - ,ry<

By the decision of the court, however,
the people of the various counties can no
longer pars ordinances by direct vote, and
those already in effect are made void.
came to the Supreme Court.
The court states that the principles of
our government forbid that there shall be
two equal co-ordinate powers covering. the
same jurisdiction. The contested section
of the act gives a power to the people
which is already vested in the Boards of
Supervisors. Supervisors can reneal or
dinances passed by popular vote, but they
can be passed again. The greatest con
fusion is therefore possible. Justice Hen
shaw says, "It is the old problem of an
irresistible force meeting an indestructible
barrier." It is the opinion of the court
that either the constitutional law giving
legislative powers to Boards of Super
visors or the county governments act giv
ing equal power to the people must be in
valid. Of course the latter must be the
one nullified. The discharge of Andrews
is accordingly ordered.
The opinion Is written by Justice Hen
_phaw, with whom Justices McFarland,
Harrison and Temple directly concur.
Justices Van Dvke and Garoutte write a
concurring opinion making plain that the
theory of our government is not that of
a pure democracy, where the laws would
be made by the direct vote of the people,
but that of a representative republic,
where law-making power Is delegated to
legally qualified representatives of the
people.
Chief Justice Beatty dissents and de
clares that he can see no reason for de
claring the law Invalid. He holds that it
cannot be unconstitutional because the
Legislature had a perfect right to pass the
act. He states that there can be no ques
tion but that the contested act is an utter
absurdity, but that under the law It
phould be allowed to remain in force until
it can be repealed.
That this is a startling innovation upon the
governmental system reco K nlzed in this State
since its earliest existence is at once appar
ent. But whether or not the Legislature has
the power bo to do Is a question the determina
tion of which may well be deferred until some
later occasion, in view of the fact that Its at
tempted exercise of that power in â¢ this in
stance Is clearly invalid. . '
. "But the court admits when the question
is fairly brought before it that its deci
sion will be on the same lines â declaring
the whole matter unconstitutional
"In the second point they decide there is
no power to create the system implied by
tho second proposition, and say: f
Upon the one hand there Is conferred 'upon
the Boerd of Sur>ervl*drsv as < has been the
universal custom, full power, to make all laws
pertaining to the government of the county
Lpon the. other hand this identical power is
bestowed- by the machinery of the ballot upon
the voters ot the county. . When- an ordinance
Is thus passed by.. ballot it has no superior
force, but has merely the same and â¢ equal
force and effect as though adopted and or
dained by the Board of Supervisors. The right
of the Supervisors to repeal such ordinance Is
not taken away, and It is within their power
to repeal them one after another as Boon as
they have been adopted. Upon the other hand,
it is equally the right of the people to- re-enact
them after such repeal. It is the old problem
of the irresistible force meeting- the lnde-*
structfble barrier. So far as legislation is
concerned, nothing could result but untold con
fusion. As the two seta of laws thus creat
ing co-ordinate lawmakine powers, . without
check, limitation or restraint, the one Â¦ upon
the other cannot.. In the nature of our govern
ment, exist. It follows that one or the other
of the provisions is Invalid and must fall
"Article II. section 20, of the charter pro
vides "for submitting ordinances at the re
auesfof-15 per cent of the voters. The
Board of Election Commissioners Is bound
to call the election. The Supervisors have
no voice in it at all. If it obtains a ma
jority vote the ordinance is passed It
cannot be repealed by the Supervisors, but
Suj-ervisors may submit propositions for
repeal at popular elections. -
Â¦ "This provision of. the charter does not
come within the proposition decided in the"
Ventura case, but it comes within the
propostlon which. they. refrain from decid
ing. This Is also true about article XII
on public utilities.- While these questions
are not touched upon in the decision, the
fact is apparent that the Supreme Court
in deciding the Ventura case, left nothing
to hope for the advocates of the referen
dum system of lawmaking, and plainly In
dicated the unconstitutionally of the sec
â¢ tlons governing it and the acquirement of
public utilities." . j
upon the constitution they have volun
tarily adopted. While this does not de
prive them of the right to declare what
they desire, as was done in the matter of
Chinese exclusion and the election of
United States Senators by direct vote of
the people, still the carrying out of these
wishes as expressed at the ballot box was

might be taken. After having expressed
their wishes all that was left the people
vLTÂ«H e y S \Â°> d< ? Was l ,Â° abIde fe y the actions
vested in the lawmaking body or bodies.
Practically speaking these provisions
override the constitution and take away
from the legislative bodies, which alone
have the right to make iaws and provide
penalties for their enforcement, their del
egated power; A prominent attorney
speaking about this question says:
"The .Ventura case Involved two ques
tionsâone whether in any event the Leg
islature can confer lawmaking power upon
the people acting directly and without the
aid and concurrence of a legislative body;
second, whether such power can be con
ferred upon the people directly, in con
junction with a like grant of power by a
legislative body, as for instance a Board
of Supervisors. ,
"The court avoids deciding the first ques
tion, saying, however, concerning it as
follows: â¢Â¦ â¢. -

A report from Wheeling to-night is that
the manager of the Aetna Standard Sheet
Plate Mill of the American Sheet Steel
Company has re'eeived orders from the
general officers to dismantle Sheet Mill
No. 1 and ship the machinery to Vander
giifjt. Pa. The work of dismantling will
be commenced at once. . *
"We started this morning with six mills
running full," said Superintendent
Harper. "Week before last we began
with two mills, which we kept running all
that week, on day turn. Last week we
added two more mills, also keeping them
running on day. turn. This morning we
added two more mills, making six in all.
About SO per cent of the men now work
ing in the plant are old men, quite a lot
of them strikers/'
The surprise of the day was the Painter
plant, with six mills, the same mills that
were running when the strike began. Not
a striker could be found anywhere near
the mill.
The officials say. the only plants at which
they expect difficulty are" at Star and the
Lindsay and McCutcheon, but they expect
to overcome all troubles there and have
the mills running full at an early date. '
The steel people ridicule the claims of
the association and point to the failure
to induce the South Chicago and Duquesne
men to go on strike as an evidence that
the strength of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation has departed. Â¦ - . - '. ; .
In the meantime both sides to the con
troversy make claims of a victory. â¢ The
steel people point to the gains they'have
made all along- the line in the way of
securing men and starting plants, while
the Amalgamated officials say in
stead of losing ground the association is
gaining every, day and that, while . tho
combine has succeeded In starting a few
plants, they are not turning out mer
chantable material and are losing money
and breaking valuable machinery, and in
the>end will. have. to ask their old men to
come to the rescue. . Â¦ Â¦-, - . Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦

It is reported, from Frear's conversa
tion with, the foreman of the Grand Jury,
that the Supreme Court here is likely to
reverse the decision of Judge Gear that
thÂ« constitution came to Hawaii with the
Tvewlands resolution of annexation, with
a dissenting opinion, which is expected to
te that of Justice Galbraith.
On the day "following. these proceedings
the attorneys for the released prisoners
eubmitted to the Supreme Court that
Justice Perry was disqualified from hear
ing the appeal, having heard and decided
the cases as a Circuit Judge. It appears
that Perry was the Judge to find the
indictments and try the cases, sentencing
tho prisoners, and it is held under the
, organic act of Hawaii and other statutes
that he is not qualified to hear the appeal
en points he has previously decided. The
Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the
<it:tstion.
HONOLULU, Aug. 20.â The Attorney
General's department and the First Cir
cuit Court appear to be at loggerheads
over the habeas corpus decisions ren
dered by Judge Gear, In which he has de
cided that the constitution of the United
States was extended to Hawaii by the
Newlar.ds resolution. Gear declared that
there was no appeal from the habeas
corpus ruling In the matter of the prison
ers convicted on the verdicts of nine
Jurors, but Attorney General Dole insisted
on taking an appeal to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime Judge Gear called a
Grand Jury to Indict the prisoners he re
leased, so that thoy might be tried again
on the old charges. He instructed the
Jury to take up the cases, but the Attor
ney General is reported to have advised
the jury that tho prisoners 'had been
legally convicted before. Foreman L. C.
Abels of the Grand Jury and Deputy At
torney General Cathcart had consulta
tions irtth Chief Justice Frear ' on the
subject, and reported that they had been
informed that the appeals 1 were to be
heard. When Gear heard of the matter
he called the Jury Into court and dis
charged It from duty, the discharge to
take effect on the completion of business
already begun. In aoing so Judge Gear
very, severely criticized " Chief Justice
Frear for having, as alleged, consulted
with the Grand Jury foreman of Gear's
court.
On the authority of a high official of
the Government it may be stated that this
delay -Is due to the expectation that a
better proposition will be received from
the French company controlling the Pan
ama canal. Up to the present great dif
ficulty has been experienced In obtaining
a satisfactory proposition from the
French company, and little progress has
been made In this respect since the com
mission submitted Its preliminary report
to Congress last December. It Is believed,
however, that a proposal which can be
considered will "be received from the
French company before Congress meets,
as otherwise the Panama route must be
passed over for Nicaragua In the com
mission's report, and it is expected that
the French company's first proposal will
name J15O.00O.0OO a3 the price for the ab
solute sale of the canal. But this figure
would probably, receive little considera
tion, as the commission has estimated
the actual value of the work thus far
done on the canal as $33,000,000, reporting
at the same time that it would cost ap
proximately $142,000,000 to finish the canal.
A high authority in canal matters be
lieves that ultimately the French com
pany will be willing to offer the canal to
the United States at the practical ap
praisal of the commission. This belief
is based on the conviction of the authori
ties that when men who control the Pan
ama company fully realize that the choice
of the Nicaragua route by the United
States would end their hope of raising
more money, rather than sacrifice all that
they have put into the canal at Panama
they will be glad to conclude arrange
ments by which they will be able to get
back even a small part, of their Invest
ment. . ?
Several members of the commission
strongly prefer the Panama route to the
Nicaragua route as an engineering prop
osition, and If an advantageous proposal
is submitted by the French company thÂ«
selection of the Nicaragua route will be
a matter of great doubt.

As to the acting. Miss Spong has cer
tainly a more sufficient part this week,
but shows no access of temperament
therein. She shows the same sunny, self

Lady Huntworth, and with no hint of fur

Spong, beautiful, and with an uncommon
eir of distinction, but she has never yet
forgotten herself in her part, and I do not
think ever will. She wore seme very stun

* Mr. Forrest is very sufficient as Lord

swiftly and easily to a finish to a flat

Miss Spong is again the irresponsible
lady with a penchant for lightsomely
making ducks and drakes of her reputa

Deus en machina all round. In "Lady
Huntworth's Experiment" she permits
her husband to "obtain a divorce from

assumed guilt she inexplicably flaunts
the latchkey of the villain's room in the
face of a man who has discovered her

by her brother's wife) from the said bad
man's writing desk. Arthur Forrest has
also a like role with his last week's
part, with the freshness and slight
vulgarity subtracted, and further be
queathed in exaggerated form to Mr.
Kinney as James Blagden. Mr. Forrest
plays the impossible hero, a kind of

"Wheels Within Wheels" as she did last
week, though it is true she does not suc

the characters concerned. The (situations,
too. are of the saxne fantastically im
possible character, but are, by much,
more amusing.

"Mr. Leach," he said, "for the first time

me an embezzler."
The witness asked, Dimmick how he
justified his taking Government funds.
Dimmick explained that he (Dimmick)
was the custodian of this particular
money, that he would not under ordinary
circumstances have had to account for it
until the end of the quarter, and that,
anyway, his bond was more than suffi

He went on to remind Leach of how
creditors had haunted him. They had
dogged his footsteps from the Mint to his
home and from his home to the Mint:
they had leaned over his desk and dunned
him during, business hours, and had
driven him to the verge of insanity. He

The rebels on the isthmus are hampered

A noticeable distinguishing feature. of

countries Liberal governments prevail.
Colombia's Conservative Government is
not popular with the Governments of the
Isthmus, but 5s popular with the revolu

The situation can be likened to a disrupt

It is reported that the Conservative re

Colombian Conservatives. Nicaragua's

similarly aided on the occasion arising.
The conditions give ground for the re

Bad Circulation is the canse of most of the ills that come vrith old age. With
advancing years there is a decline of strength and vigorâ the machinery of the
body moves with less speed and accuracy. Because of the weak and irregular
action of the heart the blood moves more slowly, becomes impure and loses much
of its life-sustajning properties, and muscles, tissues and nerves literally starve for
lack of nourishment. A sluggish and polluted circulation is followed by a long
train of bodily ailments. Cold feet, chilly sensations np and down the spine, poor
appetite and digestion; soreness of the muscles, rheumatic pains, hard and fissured
skin, face sores, chronic running Ulcers on the lower limbs and other parts of the
body â -these and many other diseases peculiar to old people are due to a lack of
healthy blood and imperfect circulation. Restoration to health must come through
the building up and purification of the blood, thus adding strength and tone to
the vital organs and quick, healthy action to the circulation.
> v"S. S. S. being strictly a vegetable blood remedy and the best tonic, makes it
the most valuable and efficacious of all medicine for old people. , It is free from all
mineral ingredients, and mild^and pleasant in its action. It cures blood diseases
of every character, even those inherited or contracted in early life. As the system
gets under the influence of S. S. S. there is a marked improvement in the general
health, and as richer and purer blood begins to circulate through the body -the
appetite improves, and there is a softness and elasticity about the skin that you
have not noticed for years ; sores begin to heal, pains in muscles and joints grad-
ually' cease, and^rdu find that it is possible to be happy and healthy even in old age.

tion of the t association 5 will result * in a
larger growth of these. unions. Â¦ â¢ , .
The open contest between the associa
tion and the packers dates back several
weeks prior to the annual meeting in
June. Both at the annual meeting and the
preliminary caucus the packers were de
nounced by President Bond as being the
cause. of the greater part of the embar
rassment of the association, and in his an
nual address Bond plainly recommended
a divorcing of the two organizations. Aa

ers likewise commenced to lay their lines
for Independent action. Results Indicate
that they Â¦ have the better of Â¦ the game

out of business when the prunes left over
from last year's pack are sold.
The packers claim â and the assertions
of the growers seem to bear it out â that
they have contracted for the purchase,
green, of the greater part of .the growing
crop of prunes. Certain it i9 that most of
the prune growers in this valley have con
tracted their prunes green at prices rang

tracts are held by packers who are mem

In fact, most of the packers of the com

as independent of the association, and say
that Its end Is near! The packers have
control of most of the. growing crop, and
it , is believed that many of : their recent
purchases of *drled prunes are for them
selves and are being stored to use against
the association when the war really
opens. *
SAN JOSE, Aug. 26.â The Case Packers

â¢ For several years the Kuskokwim has
aroused the cupidity of fortune seekers,

of that mighty, river should not contain
gold, and a few have penetrated the un
known wilds in search of the elusive pay
streak, but authentic news from, that
source has always been well nigh >an im
possibility. The river Is' a large one, and
at the mouth and at a point eighty miles
above, known as Bethel, the Â¦ Moravian
missionaries have had settlements for the
past ten years, but the upper reaches of
the stream are known to none save. the

diet of wild game.

as much as possible of the," unknown
Kuskokwim. Early "in November, boforo
the heavy fall of snow had arrived, he set
but from St. -Michael, accompanied by two
others. From such meager information
as he could obtain, he : learned that s the
best place to cross the divide from the
Yukon was at a point twenty miles below
the Russian mission. This portage proved
to be but seventy-five miles in extent and
was easily made by means of sloughs and
a chain of lakes. The Kuskokwim was
struck about. 100 miles from the mouth,
and In that immediate vicinity "' about
twenty men were found wintering, some
trapping and a few prospecting. The jour
ney up the river was continued 500 miles

was traversed forty-live miles.

Arizona Outlaws Take a

Weapons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 26.â Details were
received here to-day of the robbery last
Tuesday night at Harry Shaw's saloon in
Riverside, thirty miles east of Florence
and not far from the scene of the esca
pade of Pearl Hart, the notorious female
stage robber. A tall man and a short
man, masked with . handkerchiefs, ap
peared in the doorway, and, drawing their
weapons, compelled the occupants of the
saloon to hold up their hands. The pro
prietor was then relieved of $30 and Sam
uel Finley of $160. The robbers took
Shaw's weapons and a six-shooter and a
Winchester belonging to Finley and es
caped in the direction of Globe. The
short man did the talking.
Finley is a detective in the employ of
the Plnkerton S agency, and, -with Ed
Tewksbury and Gilbert Ailsworth, had
been in the vicinity for several days on
the lookout for supposed Oklohama train
robbers, believed to be in that section. It
Is quite probable the men who robbed
them were the ones they are looking for.
Finley is a well-known former line rider
and considered a brave man. That he
submitted to the robbery was due to the
fact that he was taken unawares and to
have resisted meant certain death.
Detective Findley has taken up the
trail of the men who robbed him, and
Sheriff Truman of Pinal County is out
with another posse.

Takes the Express and the
Coin of Two Unfortunate
Passengers.
TTKJAH, Aug. 26.â Just to prove that he
is still at large and that the numerous
suspects arrested throughout this section
of California are innocent, Mendocino
County* b lone highwayman made his reap
pearance to-day alter' a brief interval of
quiet and held up the stage running be
tween this city and Mendocino. It was
the westbound coach that be selected as
the basis of operations, and the scene of
the robbery was eleven miles west of
ITklah and only four miles from. Orrs Hot
Springs. The robber got away with two
days' accumulation of express, as there
axe no Sunday stages on this line, and
Monday's coach thereforÂ© carries a double
load. There were two passengers on the
coachâ prospective summer resort visit
orsâand as they are said to have yielded
liberally the outlaw is' believed to have
made a good haul.
News of the robbery brought to this
city this afternoon by Joseph Ainslie, the
driver of the eaetbound stage, who was
told of tbe affair when he passed the
westbound coach. The latter was driven
by Clay Rennlck. Ainslie did not Btop to
set full particulars, but hurried to this
city to give the alarm. .
The highwayman was<masked, as usual,
and was courteous in his treatment of
those from whom he collected tithes.
When he had brought the stage to a stop
the two passengers and the driver were
ordered to give up what money they had.
This they did without delay, and Â¦ the
driver was then told to throw off the ex
press box, after which the stage was per
mitted to proceed.
Driver Ainslie believes the robber in
tended to hold up both stages at the spot
where they pasE, but about the time he
finished looting tho first coach several

like a new woman. Don't suffer any pain or

I suffered all the time â had jaundice, earned
from food not digesting properly. I would have
sick headache three and four tines in a week.
Could not do the work myself. I commenced
using your medicines as recommended for liver

our doctor if he couldn't cure me, and he said he
could give me medicine to help me but the

Attorney Rothschild stated further that
there was no probability that another of
ficial meeting of the committee would be
held. In view of the attitude of both
parties to the controversy such a meet
ing not only would be without result but
an absolute waste of time.
"We sought in every way to bring about
peace, but failed," said Joseph Roths
child, a member of the committee, yes
terday.. "We had the affair nearly closed
Saturday, and had it not been for the per
sistency of Casey and Furuseth, both of
whom were determined that no negotia
tions for peace would be considered unless
the proposals were offered to them .per
sonally, the strike might now be ended.
"The Employers' Association assured
us that any committee of the strikers
would be welcomed, the sole condition
being that neither Casey nor Furuseth be
identified with the committee. The em
ployers wished to treat directly with their
employes and not with the leaders, with
whom they had nothing in common. This
condition was not agreed to, both Casey
and Furuseth declaring the adoption of
such an agreement virtually meant the
betrayal of their followers. I told them
if they were honest in their 'avowals of
sincerity and desire for peace they would
consent to the proposition. They declined
to give their consent to the plan and ne
gotiations were accordingly declared off."
The executive committee of the Munici
pal Federation,, which has been engaged
for some weeks In the task of bringing
about an. adjustment of the strike, for
mally abandoned its self-imposed task
yesterday. The efforts of the committee
to secure a conference between the em
ployers and strikers proved to be futile,
and as the object for which it was pri
marily organized has been defeated the
committee will retire from business for
a time at least.
The failure of the committee to solve
the strike trouble by securing conces
sions from both employers and strikers
and thereby ending the controversy is
attributed by several of the members to
the unreasonable obstinacy of Michael
Casey and Andrew Furuseth. the princi
pal strike leaders. These men absolutely
refused to negotiate with the Employers'
Association in any manner whatsoever
unless the employers consented to recog
nize them as leaders of the strikers and
conduct all -peace negotiations through
them. The result was a failure to reacn
an agreement and a consequent settle
ment of the trouble.

A â¢ dispatch; was received in the city
yesterday announcing that the National
Association of Brewers at New York' had
declared war against the National Union
of Brewery Workmen, and that hostili
ties would commence on September 1,
with a lockout of some 20,000 men."
News of such Â¦ action has not yet
reached the brewers of this city, who
are affiliated with the National Associa
tion. The relations between the brewers
and their employes here are of the most
amicable character,- and it is believed
that the action of the national /body will
have no effect upon the brewing - inter
ests in this city.
Rudolph Mohr, secretary of the Brew
ers' Protective Association, said yester
day that the reported action of the na
tional Â¦ body would not, In his opinion,
have any effect upon the brewers In San
Francisco. He had not received official
notification of the reported lockout on

The Union Iron Works succeeded in getting ' forty-two men
yesterday, the greater number of which are new arrivals from the

iron men is regarded as being most encouraging.
Preparations for a great pa rade by wage -workers on Sep

of all trades In line, Irrespective of those, represented in the

An effort will be made to secure the assistance of the local

that the Influence of these gentlemen will be felt among the em

them on August 2. . .
places where men congrre'grate there was a feeling: of unrest
and uncertainty and of fear that the forces of the Tvorkingnien
were crumbling: and that the end'of the trouble -was close at hand.
These rumors, intangible in themselves and impossible of verifi

by the leaders of the ivorkingnien. No one seemed to" know
whence they came, but many anxious inquiries were made at the
various union headquarters for verification. This feeling:,' so gen

The Board of Supervisors authorized the Mayor at its meet

said:
"Even assuming that the statements
contained In Mr. Tobln's and Mr. Reed's
resolutions are true, I Fay it would be un
wise to adopt them. What the laboring
men want now is work, and I believe that
the proper solution of the controversy is
the appointment of a committee of five
by the Mayor to confer with the Chamber
of Commerce, the Board of Trade and the
Employers' Association to settle this un
fortunate strike. It may be argued that
the Mayor and the Municipal League
have failed in *heir efforts to bring about
a settlement of the dispute. But that
should not deter us from taking action.
"We can then place the responsibility
where It belongs and bring down condem
nation on those who are guilty of para
>2/.-z'ng trade. Let us postpone action and
v.ake one final effort to restore industrial
peace in the community."
Dwyer favored postponement of consid
eration for one week only in the hope that
a. settlement would bo effected under the
Curtis resolution.
Reed accepted the resolution as re
modeled by Tobin, as it practically cov
ered the points as contained in the peti
tion of the Labor Council. Reed objected
to postponement, however, contending
that it was incumbent on the board, as
representatives of the people, to give of
ficial expression regarding the labor trou
ble. ,
Brandenstein argued that it would not
be well to cause further friction between
the contending parties to the strike, and
Tiiade a plea to postpone consideration of
Tobln's resolution.
"Let ns not intensify the heat and ani
mosity between employer and employe "
said Brandenstein, "by injecting ourselves
Into the controversy and adopting con
demnatory resolutions which will be of no
avail."
The resolution was then referred to the
Police Committee, who will consider it
jointly with Reed's resolution, for which
it is intended to be a substitute.

the progress of which the Chamber of Com
merce by order of its Board of Trustees, and
through its president and secretary, has seen
fit to stigmatize the condition of the city as
dangerous to life and property, and has called
upon the Mayor to issue a proclamation order-
Ing the people to be peaceful, and also asking
him, if necessary, to call upon the Governor

credit upon their good citizenship; and
Whereas, The letter of the Chamber of Com
merce containing the said statement Is not
Â¦warranted by the facts and has been character
ized by the Mayor as unwise and unnecessary ;
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
the city and county of San Francisco con
demns the intemperate language of the Cham
ber of Commerce and declares that the con
duct of the striking wape earners has been in
the main highly creditable to their citizenship;
end that no occasion exists for a proclamation
by the Mayor, or for the calling out of the
military by the Governor; and be it further
Resolved, That the character and qualification
of special police officers should be scrupuously

they should be under the special and contin

it further
Resolved. That the Police Department should
preserve absolute impartiality between the par
ties of the pr^Fent labor controversy; that the
â¢wage earners and employes are equally entitled
to the servic* of the police, and that the func
tions of the police should be strictly confined
to maintaining the peace, arid they, should not
directly or Indirectly give aid or assistance to
either of the parties to the labor controversy.
Curtis Opposes Adoption.
In moving that Tobin' s resolution be re

Heed's Resolution Postponed.

Commerce, for stigmatizing the condition
of the city as riotous and asking the
Mayor to call on the Governor for mili
tary aid In maintaining the law and re-
Quirlns the uniforming of special police
men, which resolution was recommended
for passage by the Police Committee, was
postponed for one week.
Supervisor Tobin stated that he, as a
member of the Police Committee, had not
been made acquainted with the full pur
port of the resolution presented by the
committee, and he was not in accord with
several of its provisions.
"I do not think that It Is just to hold
Mr. Newhall accountable and responsible
for the expressions of opinion of the
Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore I
-am not in favor of compelling special po
lice officers to wear uniforms, believing
that the matter should be left to the dis
cretion of the Police Commission."

Await High Court
â¢ Decision.
Loose , Construction of New
Law Shuts Off Source
-} of Revenue.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
.SACRAMENTO,; Aug.. 26.-The retail
liquor; dealers of this i city, acting on the
advice of their attorney, Elwood Bruner,
still refuse to pay the- license demanded
by the : county. They declare they will
not pay until the Supreme Court shall
have passed upon the case sent up. from
Los -Angeles to test the law passed by
.the; last Legislature, by.' which, it is
claimed, retail liquor dealers . who - pay
revenue to incorporated cities for pur
poses of Â¦ police regulation, are exempt
from paying county license. . â¢
Attorney Bruner, representing the Re
tail Liquor Dealers' Association of this
city.* was before the Board of Supervisors
to ascertain whether any action would be
taken to force, the collection of county
licenses by bringing suit. Mr. Bruner said
that' each member of the association stood
ready to. pay his license tax, provided the
Supreme, Court -decided the suit of ex
parte Firman in favor of the county.
Mr. Bruner said he desired to put the
money within the read* of the county in
case the Supreme Court decided in its fa
vor, and that he and the District Attorney
had agreed, subject to the action of .the
Board "of Supervisors, to place the license
money in the national bank of D. O. Mills
& Co., subject to the demand of the coun
ty in case the Supreme Court should de
cide that it Is entitled to the same.
Mr. Bru;:er, when asked for an opinion,
said he believed the cast would be decided
against the counties, and that until the law
was repealed by the Legislature the coun
ty would derive no revenue from .any sa
loon that pays a city license. 1 It was for
that reason that he felt it his duty to ad
vise the people he represented to refuse to
pay the tax. - . -. - Â¦ Â¦ ;
After much discussion the Supervisors
decided that they should be guided by the
advice of the District Attorney, who. was
requested to submit a written opinion at
the' October session. Until then nothing
will be done to compel payment of the li
censes. , - .
Sacramento is only one of a number of
counties that are experiencing this same
trouble owing to the loose construction of
the new. license law.
|w 'Â»o NCOURAGED by their recent pa
| a rade, the labor unions are pre
â¢ I paring for a magnificent -turnout
)i, *-*$ on Labor day. ' The . committee in
charge of the arrangements met
yesterday morning and decided to send a
circular to every union in the- city, re
questing it to: participate in the -'parade.
The majority of the unions have. already
signified their intention of turning'out'ln
full strength,* arid a number of . unions
have placed a fine of $5 on any member
who does not appear in line. The cele
bration will not be held "merely to display
the numerical strength of the unions, as
was done on Saturday, but it will partake
of 'the spectacular. Bands . will be inter
spersed'all through the line of march.
At the conclusion of the parade, appro
priate literary exercises will be held in
Mechanic?' Pavilion. In the . evening ' a
ball will be given for the benefit of the
men who are out on strike or who are
locked out. j
The circular which will be sent to the
various unions reads as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 26, 1901.
To the Unions of San Franciscoâ Dear Sirs
and Brothers, Greeting: The San Francisco
Labor Council hereby invites you to take part
in the Labor day celebration to be held on
Monday,- September 2. â¢ -â¢
The celebration, will consist of a parade,
literary exercises Â» and a ball. " Â¦
The parade will start at 10 or 11 in the fore
noon (.definite hour to be Â¦ announced later),
The literary exercises will consist of speak
ing, recitations and music and will be held at
the Mechanics' 'Pavilion after the conclusion
of the parade. . . '
The ball will be held at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion in the evening, commencing at 8 o'clock
and closing at 1 a. m. Â¦ . â¢ " â¢
The literary exercises will be free. Ball tick
ets will be 25 cents; ladies free. >
The ball will be given for the benefit of* the
union men on strike or locked out. The com
mittee in charge has established headquarters
at room 203, Emma Spreckels building, 927
Market street, where . information on the de
tails of the celebration will be furnished.
The committee, hereby urges upon you, if
your union has not already voted to parade, to
.hold. If necessary, a special meeting to take
action on this matter. v^
The unions in the parade j will be grouped
accordirg to their respective trade couneH
lines. Unions not affiliated with any group
council will form a division of the miscel
laneous trades.
Music for the parade has to be furnished by
the respective group councils ; or individual
unions, as the might be. AH union3
please notify the secretary of the Labor day
committee of the action taken. Unions not
affiliated with any group council are hereby
specially unred to get into immediate com
munication with the secretary of the Labor
day committee.
Brothers, organized labor of this city is be
ing fiercely attacked by the Employers' As
sociation. We are giving our enemies a good
fight. In numbers there is strength. Let us
therefore turn out in full force, thereby cheer
ing each other In this -great fight for freedom
and Justice. Let our enemies, who have
formed their secret association for the purpose
of disrupting our unions, come, by looking at
our united strength, to the full realization of
the impossible task they have , undertaken.
Turn out with us in the Labor day parade and
you will be helping to win the fight ' for the
right to organize, a fight which we must win
if we hope to preserve American Institutions,
if we hope to continue to enjoy the blessings
of liberty gained by our forefathers and our
selves, if we hope to add to them and trans
mit them to our descendants. â¢ .. '
Labor day is our day and let us use it for
our enjoyment, for our benefit. We remain,
yours for union and progress, by order of the
Labor day committee, W. H. GOFF,
ED ROSENBERG, Secretary. Â¦ Chairman.
Bankers Will Assist.
; A report was current yesterday that
the aid of the presidents of the local
banking institutions would be invoked by
business men, who believe that their in
fluence will be considerable In" securing
a settlement of the strike.
Several bankers who . Â¦were questioned
yesterday said that while there had been
no action taken by them as a body rela
tive to the strike, they were, neverthe
less, willing to do all in their power to
bring about a settlement of the diffi
culty. They had little hope of accom
plishing anything, however, inasmuch as
other influential bodies of representative
business men had failed. It was ad
mitted that the strike was not conducive
to profitable banking business, . and that
the necessity for decisive action ofâsome
kind may result in bringing the dispute
to a close was imperative.
Striking Painters at Work.
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â With the excep
tion of the firm of Cobbledick Bros., the
mftster painters of this city to-day ac
cepted the terms of the agreement made
Friday in San Francisco with the Paint
ers' Union, carrying the new wage
schedule of $3 50 a day. The striking
workmen returned to their jobs this
morning. The journeymen painters have
agreed that no member shall accept a
contract on his own account without
joining the Master Painters' Association:
The steam schooner Mandalay is being
discharged at Adams' docks by a non
union crew, as is the steam schooner
Crescent City at Derby's yards. The
four-masted schooner Muriel is lying at
the Puget Sound Lumber Company's
wharf awaiting a non-union gang.
Rumor of "Withdrawal Denied.
There was a rumor along the water
front last night to the effect that the
marine firemen had held a meeting at
which it was decided to withdraw from
the federation and return to work, and
that they had appointed a delegate to so
notify the other unions. So persistent was
this rumor that Police Sergeant Blank
telephoned it to police headquarters as a
fact. At the union headquarters, how
ever, it was denied most emphatically
that the men had held any meeting or
that they contemplated any such action.
Pickets of the Marine Firemen's Union
were last night posted as usual.
Wittman's Case Continued.
The case of Police Captain George W.
Wittman, charged with battery upon
James Masse, a marine . fireman,' was
called in Judge Cabaniss' court yesterday
morning. The courtroom was crowded.
Captain Wittman asked for a continuance
till "Thursday, as his attorney, John A.
Hosmer, would be engaged in the Superior
Court until then. Attorney John J. Bar
rett, who represents the prosecution, of
fered no objection to the continuance and
it was granted.
"Will Support the Federation.
j The Marine Painters' Union ,. held its
regular weekly meeting last night in Teu
toniaHall'and decided that, although its
union is not affiliated with the City Front
Federation, it! will stand by that organi
zation until the adjustment of the strike.
At the solicitation of a' committee from
the Brotherhood of Teamsters financial
support was voted to j the striking team
sters. > ; ' - Â¦. l Â¦ -. : * Â¦"Â¦'.Â¦ Â¦. â¢â¢"--.Â¦'. .'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦

Peruna is - the favorite tonic not only
among soldiers, but among all classes of
people. Any one .weak or convalescent
after an acute illness will find Peruna to
hasten- their, recovery and help them re-
gain their usual strength and vigor.
Mrs. T. B. Smith, hospital matron. Oma-
ha Barracks, writes from 2327 N. Clark
street, Chicago, 111., as follows:
"Peruna seemed to be the favorite tonic
among, the i soldiers at the barracks. If
they were .weak or convalescent after an
illness it would build them up and restore
their strength in a very few days. I used
it myself last fall for a very severe back-
ache and bearing-down pains and found
that three bottles completely cured me."â
MRS. T.rB. SMITH.
Give Pe-ru-na the Credit for Their Re-
" gained Health.
In case of weakness and backache, bear-
ing-down pains and despondency so com-
mon among women Peruna is an absolute
specific. It cures by stimulating the ap-
petite, strengthening the digestion, quick-
ening- the circulation and producing an
equilibrium of the various functions of
the body.
Mrs. Anna Miller, Stoneville. Ohio,
writes:
"If it had not been for Peruna I would
have been dead now. I am stout and
hearty; I would not be without Peruna
for anything:. It is the best remedy for
catarrh In the world. I cannot recommend
it} highly enough. It has done wonders
for me."â Anna Miller.
Mrs. "Verena Schupbach. Dallas, Tex.,
writes :\ ; .
"/ am vary thankful for your val-
uable medicine. I have become well
and strong by means -of it. I am 55
years old; am past the change of life,
but keep \Peruna in the house. My
daughter-in-law took Peruna when
she was so weak she could not do her
housework. Even the first bottle did
her good"-~Verena Shupbach, 439
Lamanster street, Dallas, Tex.
No other inedlcine has received the
praise and commendation of so many
people for suc^i a variety of ailments as
Peruna. | â¢
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results iJrom the use of Peruna.
Â¦write at once to\ ; Dr. Hartman, giving: a
full statement oj your case, and he will
be' pleased to giye you his valuable ad-
vice gratis.

The Constitution has had so much bad luck in her
trials against the Columbia that people are beginning
to fear she may have some of the same sort when she
tackles the challenger. As a rule the American peo
ple do not believe in luck, but all the same they don't
like the way this thing looks.
; The committee in^ charge of the Victoria memo
rial to be erected in London have decided to record
the names of the great men of. the empire during he'r
reign on a series of tablets surrounding: the. princi
pal \ group of statuary, and now their troubles have
begun. Nearly every man arid woman in- the em
pire who can write /Is sending names which they in
sist should be recorded among the great.* It is prob
able that when completed the tablets will bear some
resemblance to a city directory.
Kangaroo tendon Is In great request
among surgeons, says an English writer,
for making the larger ligatures, for it is
absorbed in tne tissue and leaves no
foreign matter. Some surgeons prefer the
older silk ligament, maintaining that it
Is on the whole more satisfactory and
that the foreign matter can easily be
removed, but the majority, favor the prep
aration from the marsupial. The French
College of Surgeons, indeed, is so appre
hensive of a falling oft in the supply, due
to the merciless war waged on the kan
garoos in their own home by stock owners
anxious ,to save the available pasture for
their cattle, that it* is seriously proposed
to acclimatize them on. a large, scale In
France. As two* Bpecles, at 'any rate
Bennett's wallaby and the "â¢Â¦gTGa.t ' kan
garoo, already do well atlarge'ln a num
ber of French and English parks, there
seems no reason > why the suggestion
should not be adopted, 'though the kan
garoo .tribe, .once made thoroughly*, at
home, is as difficult to. eradicate as the
rabbit.. ; . . '

WRITING FOR THE PRESSâSubscrib
er,'City. A person who has talent and l&
able to write for the press, whether daily
or periodical, can find a market for that
talent without influence. Matter intended
for the press must be written on one slda
of the page only. Typewritten copy Is
preferred. Copy may be submitted in
person or by mail. If accepted, the write Jt
will be, notified; if rejected it will go Intrf
the waste basket unless there Is a request
for return and sufficient postage accom
panies the request. A person sending copy
to a paper or magazine should alwaj-3
preserve a manifold copy thereof, as there
are some editors who are careless about
-copy, notwithstanding that a request and
stamps for the return accompany the mat
ter. A book may be Copyrighted by send
ing a copy of the title page to the libra
rian of Congress at Washington, D. C,
with 50 cents as a fee, and on the day of
publication of the book sending two copies
of the best edition thereof. The fact that
matter submitted to an editor doe3 not
meet his approval should not dlscouraga
the writer.- On a number of occasions
first-class articles have been rejected by
two or more editors who did not take time
to read what was submitted, and when ac
cepted by another made quite a hit.
THE BEE-Curious, City. The reason
that Napoleon I adopted the bee as a
regal emblem was that he wanted some
thing more ancient than the fleur de Ii3.
He adopted the bee because when tha
tomb of Childeric, who reigned 433 to 481,
was opened in 1633 there was found, in
addition to other relics, about 300 of what
the French heralds thought were bees of
the purest gold, their wings being inlaid
with a red stone like cornelian. These
fleurons, supposed to have been attached
to the trappings of a war horse, were sent
to Louis XIV, but it was Napoleon who
sprinkled them over the imperial robes as
emblematic of the enterprise anu activity
of his dynasty. It is thought that what is
called the fleur de Us la really a bee with
outstretched wings.
AN AMENDMENTâ J. J. H., City. Par
liamentary law does not require that an
amendment to a motion must be accepted
by the proposer of the motion before it
can be placed before the meeting. TK^
presiding officer of your lodge who re'f
fused to present an amendment that had
been properly seconded stands in need of
a few lessons in Cushing, Robert or somo
other work on parliamentary law.
There is no reason why the meeting at. Buffalo
should not produce good results. The people are
now prosperous and can well afford to undertake
road improvements. The increasing use of automo
biles makes also a new demand for good highways. It
is time for our people to grapple with the problem in
earnest. The improvements would carry a benefit to
every class in the community. The Buffalo congress
may be expected to furnish suggestions of practical
value ! on every : phase- of the. problem involved iri
road construction, and , the proceedings, therefore,
will be well worth the attention of all who are in
terested in the general subject. -VI "k .>:':
It has been estimated that the people, of the United
States pay about $500,000,000 a year for bad roads.
For the same amount they could get good roads.
What is needed for the desired improvement is not
so much a larger expenditure of money as a more
intelligent use of the money that is expended. Fur
thermore,- bad roads . entail a large waste in the
amount of time and energy required to haul farm
produce over them, so that there will be, a great
economy in the establishment of highways suitable
to our civilization.
Not long ago the National Good Roads Associa
tion, in co-operation with the Illinois Central Rail
road, sent out a train to construct short roads at vari
ous points on the route of that railway from Chicago
to New Orleans. The work had the effect of exciting
a great interest in highway improvement along the
whole line, â¢ and in Illinois,, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi and Louisiana a new impetus was given
to road work, and a movement started among the
people which is almost sure to achieve large results
in the near future. . . .
WITH the approaching meeting of the Good
Roads Congress at Buffalo it is to be hoped
there will come a revived interest all over
the country in the problems of highway improvement.
The campaign of education^on the subject has been
under way for a long time, but in only a few States
has anything like a comprehensive system of road
work been even so much as devised.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
PERSONAL MENTION.
AMERICANâ A. S., City. American is
a native of America, north or south. Tho
name was originally applied to the
aboriginal inhabitant, but now to the de
scendants of Europeans born In America:
In a restricted sense it is applied to tha
inhabitants of the United States.
Were the three states combined the nation would
be the third in South America in area and the second
in population. It would take rank with Brazil and Ar
gentine and have great possibilities of national life.
Surh a political possibility is naturally tempting to
ardent patriots. It is an issue that raises the present
qnarrel far above the ordinary strife of South Ameri
can parties. Of course the people and the Govern
ment of Colombia have doubtless good reasons for
objecting to merge their independent existence in
that of a new republic, but the exact nature of these
reasons has not yet been madexlear to outsiders.
It is somjwhat strange that Colombia should be
the one of the three states to hold out against union,
for by reason of her larger population she would be
the dominant state of the federation, unless the other
two should always combine against her. According
to recently compiled figures Colombia has an area of
about 505,000 square miles, Ecuador of I2o,ooo # and
Venezuela of 594,000, a total of 1,210,000 square miles.
Colombia's population is about 4,500,000, Ecuador's
1,500,000 and Venezuela's 3,000,000, a total of
9,000,900.
If the report be true it affords an intelligible ex
planation of the interference of Venezuela and
Ecuador in the Colombian troubles. It would mean
that the unionists of those countries perceive in the
present situation an opportunity to accomplish their
political aspiratio/ns, and consequently have given to
the Liberals of Colombia all the help they can. Nor
is it at all unlikely that both Venezuela and Ecua
dor, where the/ feeling in favor of reunion is appar
ently very strpng, would gladly join hands with the
Colombian rebels if they were in any way given a
reasonable assurance of success.
It appears, however, that in the present imbroglio
that involves Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador
there is something in the nature of big politics under
lying the movements of the chief actors. The three
states were originally united as one country. It was
in that form they gained independence from Spain.
Their territory, however, was a vast one and was but
sparsely populated. Communication was difficult and
local prejudices and passions soon led to a break
ing up of the early gorernmenL Of late there has
been a strong sentiment among a considerable num
ber of the people in faror of "reuniting as one nation,
and it is said to be that sentiment which animates the
leaders and their followers who are now warring
against the Colombian Government.
WARS among the states of Central and
South America are as a rule so much the
result of a general lawlessness and readi
ness among the people to fight after their manner
that they rarely merit much attention. In most
cases hardly anything is involved beyond the per
sonal fortunes of the leaders. Foreign powers have
generally contented themselves with protecting the
lives and property of any of their citizens" doing busi
ness in the disturbed country, leaving the natives free
to fight as they please.

Of course, Evans has not been harmed much by the
censure put upon him. Probably he has been bene
fited so far ' as the sale of his book is concerned.
Chandler certainly has gained nothing. He would
have been wiser had he adopted the tactics of the
British War Office and left his critic unnoticed.
. It would be difficult indeed to lay down a definite
rule upon the subject. No one would think of ques
tioning the right of a naval officer "to criticize the
methods of a Secretary of the Navy of fifty years ago.
Should he be permitted to give his judgment of the
actions of a Secretary cf twenty-five years ago?
It is to be noted that no attempt has been made
by any one responsible for the conduct of the war in
the Transvaal to censure General Chamberlain for his
words. The silence on the part of the War Depart
ment may be due to a desire to say as little as pos
sible-about the business, but it may also be due to a
recognition of the right of a retired officer to criticize
as he pleases. If such a right exists, then the cen
sure upon Evans was hardly, justifiable.
Of those things the old field marshal says: "Even
in the dark days of the Indian mutiny, Vhen there was
an ever-present sense of the inhumanities practiced
by the mutineers and others who abetted them, there
never existed the idea that the horrors of war were
to be indiscriminately carried into the homes of the
population, i Happily the representative of the crown
then in India was a nobleman of calm, humane in
stincts, and history now lauds the part played by the
man who at the time was railed against as 'Clemency
Canning.' " .
Evans charged that Chandler mistreated him be
cause he refused; to make appointments to suit the
political machine with which Chandler; at the time
was working, and expressed contempt for the Secre :
tary by referring to his action as the stinging of an
insect. The charges of General . Chamberlain are
much more severe. He has denounced what he calls
"the frequent injudicious, if not reckless, burning or
sacking of the farmsteads or homes of the Boers, the
removal or destruction of the food stored in their
houses for the maintenance of their families, the
sweeping away of s all cattle and sheep, the destruction
of mills and implements of agriculture, and also the
forcible removal into camps of all women and chil
dren, and there being kept in bondage."
CENSURE pronounced by the Department of
the Navy so promptly upon Rear / Admiral
Evans for his criticism upon ex-Secretary
Chandler gives an added interest to the criticism re
cently pronounced upen the British War Department
by Sir Neville Chamberlain, a retired field marshal of
the British army. In each case there is involved the
question of the extent to which a military or naval
officer has the right to go in criticizing the conduct
of the war authorities of his country. . .

ONE of the : most striking and interesting features pro
!" posed for the Louisiana Purchase Centennial,Celebra
tion at St. Louis in 1903 is the "Children's Building,"
a structure devoted exclusively; to the amusement and
instruction of children. The architecture of this build
ing is to.be replete with sculptural groups representing the
stories and legends of childhood, not only of our own nationâ
of the Anglo-Saxon race â but of all nations. It is the inten
tion to make this building for the world's children something
never equaled, and never to be forgotten. Charles Dexter, a
gentleman interested in the proposed "Children's Building" at
the St. Louis World's Fair, in a letter addressed to the Presi
dent of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company, says:
"In the line of ornamentation I would suggest outside and
inside groups' of statuary. delineating Mother Goose stories and
other childish-legends. I \ would make the idea of instruction
subservient to that of amusement; though' combining both
ideas. as much as possible, illustrating, for instance, all the
great natural sciences. Selections can be made from each and
all of them, showing the most curious and striking truths from'
that realm, which would specially appeal to the child mind.
Trained persons should be employed to mark out an appro
priate programme. : All the various arts, sciences and indus
tries should be drawn, on. '.â¢Â¦.Â¦/
"We could make the greatest display of dolls ever made,
representing the dolls of all nations: the games, legends and
stories of children of all nations. The stories of the young of
animals, the birds of the air and also the inhabitants of the
deep sea; the curious habits of the animals and birds in rela
tions to their youngr, as well as insect life, and Indeed all
animal life wherever the beautiful and wonderful maternal re
lations could be delineated; the strange freiks and metamor

In it all is a pitiful element found in the pinch that
is felt in the homes of laboring men. The union
leader, the business agent and the walking -delegate
are not pinched. Their pay goes on, but these lead
ers who command the union treasury are doling out
a dollar a 'week to men of family whom they ordered
to strike and quit employment that paid from $2 to
$4 per day. In- the homes of these idle men want
is beginning to show, its haggard face. Wives and
children are. being put on part rations, fuel, food and
clothing are getting less, and the rent is overdue.
At the same time work and wages wait for. them all.
They had no dispute with their employers, no griev
ance about hours or wages, but quit work unwill
ingly, because they were ordered to do so by leaders
who thrive while the workman's family wants. If
man's inhumanity to man; need a new illustration,
here it. is. "
These strikers, ordered to quit work by these' lead-
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company had a con
tract with the Marine Firemen's .Union 'which that
body violated, pleading a power equal. to that of a
nation when treaties are broken. , But suppose the
steamship company had been the violator, the Fire
men's Union would have hired a lawyer, gone into
court and enforced the contract, and would have
laughed at such a plea made by. the employer.
Not many workingmen will fail to see the danger
ous folly of such a claim. It means that all others
must keep contracts and agreements because the em
ployer has property that is responsible. Â¦ He cannot
go into court and plead his right to break a contract
because a nation. breaks its treaties when it goes to
war.
There is an instance in which union workmen dif
fer with their badly advised leaders. They made a
contract, advantageous to them and enforceable by
law against their employers, and are told by President
Shaffer and Secretary Tighe that their obligation to
their union is superior to their obligation to a con
tract which they voluntarily made. If workingmen
will examine the subject uninfluenced by leaders
whose leadership is made to seem necessary by labor
troubles, they will find that there are several obliga
tions which precede their allegiance to leaders, which
is often the real meaning of their union obligation.
These leaders in San Francisco have caused the vio
lation of contracts, ' entered into by unions, which
employers have strictly observed, and when taxed
with this bad faith have said that "a nation violates
its treaty contracts when it "goes to war and union
labor has the same right."
All workingmen will finally feel the bad effects of
impairment of their right of contract and of the vio
lation of agreements. In a conference held last Sat
urday with President Shaffer of the Amalgamated
Association a Pittsburg dispatch says that the
executives of various labor organizations, Messrs.
Mitchell, White and Jenkes, criticized the action of
President Shaffer in violating the contracts made by
the union with trie Western steeel mills, but the same
day in Chicago Mr. Tighe, Shaffer's secretary, de
nounced the union steel workers who wished to keep
their word and their contract inviolate, accusing them
of "deserting their union in order to live up to a
contract."
The only meaning to be taken from this is that a
university man is a gentleman and a stevedore is not
a gentleman. No wise friend of labor penned that
letter, for honor and fame from no condition rise, and
a stevedore may be as truly a gentleman as if he were
a university man or were born in the purple. An
other evidence that bad advisers, who have motives
entirely wide of the interests of labor, are taking a
hand in these proclamations is found in the attempt
to shift the responsibility of the damage done to farm
ers and fruit-growers by the strike. Country produce
suffers from the sympathetic feature of the strike. The
leaders say to the country people that they would
grant permission to handle country produce if the
employers would do certain things. But. the em
ployers did not order any strike, sympathetic or
otherwise, and the issue between them and the labor
leaders does not cqver that part of the industrial
field where country produce is handled. The country
people see clearly that the leaders need no concert
with the employers in order to handle such perishable
property as is now in danger of destruction. . We
need not say to wage-workers that such leadership is
more damaging to them than any organized opposi
tion to union labor can ever be. As for union labor,
it is not a new thing. It came long ago and to stay.
It is capable of giving stability to industry, of bring-'
ing thrift, temperance and economy into the homes
of labor, and of stimulating that t ambition. by which
men of enterprise go forward to independence. A
majority of the members of the Employers' Associa
tion began life as workingmen, and on less wages
than they now pay to others, achieved independence
and began business for themselves. That door out
ward toward independence should, never be closed,
but it is* not kept open by strikes, which cut off pro
duction and paralyze industry-
The evidence of outside help or inspiration in the
work of preparing documents issued by labor leaders
is found in such statements as are made in the letter
to President Wheeler and the circular to the country
press. In the Wheeler letter, signed by Goff and
Rosenberg, occurs this remarkable statement: "A
liberal education makes those who are capable of re
ceiving it gentlemen. . * * * Public opinion' is
strong, and we can assure you that the people are not
at all disposed to pay for the establishment in the
State University of a department for the education
of â well, say stevedores."
It would seem that only the men who are called
labor leaders and are salaried out of labor union funds
are greatly influenced by such advice and such ad
visers. The rank and file, the laboring masses, take
their- orders too implicitly from such leaders and are
the ones injured by evil counsel. The several circu
lars and proclamations published by such leaders bear
evidence of preparation by outsiders, whose. object is
the creation of friction and disorder, and not the
bringing of a good understanding between'the em
ployer and the employed. The personal abuse of em
ployers, the contemptuous characterization of them,
and ascription to them of unmanly and evil motives,
are not the work of men who 1 have b.een in their em
ploy, nor is it the work of any wise leader of labor.
The mass of wage-earners must be impressed by the
absence of like abuse of them, and the lack of retali
atory epithets, in anything that has been said by or
in behalf of the employers.
The country needs for its prosperity free labor and
free capital. Both of these partners in production
suffer when those who neither pay wages nor earn
them intrude upon a situation for the purpose^of ad
vancing selfish interests that are not the concern
either of wage-payers or wage-earners.
WE see no 'reason 'to change our opinion that
the wage earners are badly advised by such
volunteer counselors as the ' Examiner and
the politicians. .

which their leaders teach them to call others â¢scabs,

The live men of Humboldt County have
decided to maintain a permanent exhibit
of the products of their county in this
city and have taken the first steps to
bring this about. For some time the Hum
boldt Chamber of Commerce, which is in
Eureka, has seen the advisability of keep
ing the merits of solid old Humboldt De
fore the world. Correspondence has given
them reason for a permanent exhibit with
the State Board of Trade in the ferry
building at the foot of Market street. G.
A. Dc-nnison, acting secretary of the
State Board of Trade, has just received
a letter from Eureka, in which it is set
forth that the resources of Humboldt will
be "well represented in an unique pavil
ion." This will be in the shape of a hugÂ©
redwood tree, and the exterior will con
sist of the bark of one of the giants of
the forest. The interior will be lined with
polished slabs of commercial redwood.
Within the pavilion other products of the
county will be shown in profusion.
There are only thirty counties of Cali
fornia that keep themselves before the
public in the rooms of the State Board ot
Trade, although it is a fact that thou
sands of visitors pass through the exhi
bition hall and examine the horticultural,
agricultural and mineral exhibits of the
S v? ate T ? very month. This is the first time
that Humboldt County has decided to be
permanently in the public eye. T X>

there Is going to be trouble. Men are

On May 10 the Thalatta was hove to un

were carried away on the Thalatta, the

?Ftcte of David J. Kent, deceased, filed
i libel yesterday in the United States Cir
cuit Court against the Union Transporta
tion Company for $50,000 damages for the

ing a whistle or giving warning other
wise, ran down the launch in which Kent

The complaint alleges further that the
collision was not caused by any careless
ness on the part of Kent or on the part
Df the persons in charge of the launch
Dauntless which was doing the towing,
rmt that on the contrary it was caused
by the negligence of the parties navlgat
ng the steamboat Dauntless.

One of the steerage passengers on the
Hongkong Maru is under the care of the
ship's surgeon suffering from six knife
wounds. Jud-jing from the stories the
steerage of this Japanese steamship is not
a safe place to travel in. The firemen
have been in the habit of using it as a
lounging place, and resented the presence
of passengers. Several of the latter were
women, and when their husbands remon
strated with the firemen for coming Into
the room nearly naked they got angry
and started to run amuck. The white of
ficers attempted to stop the fracas and
succeeded for a time. The row broke out
again, however, and a Spanish steerage
passenger was chased into the main sa
loon, where he fell and was stabbed six
times in the back and thighs before the
infuriated Jap fireman could be seized and
locked up. It is only a few weeks ago
that the chief__engineer of the Nippon
Maru was beateii by his firemen, and he is
still in the hospital.* A Japanese chief en
gineer took the vessel out of San Fran
cisco.

Comte moved the indlflnlte postpone
ment of the ordinance, because the City
Attorney had filed an opinion that where
the maximum license to be collected on
street cars Is fixed at $15 per annum In the
franchises the Supervisors have not the
power to increase the license tax. Comte
said that the franchises specifying the
license covered the main lines throughout
the city. The. vote on indefinite postpone
ment follows:

The steamer Mandalay arrived with over 1000
packages of Butter, consisting oX 810 boxes*and
200 kegs. This tended to make the market top
heavy, and no further advance was reported.
In fact; dealers said that they could buy at
slight concessions. Cheese remained firm.
Eggs, like Butter, lacked the firmness of
last week, and some dealers reported accumula
ting stocks, though others quoted a firm mar
ket. The price has got to a point where the
retail demand suffers some check.
Receipts were- 27,100 pounds of Butter, 511

CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â A lack of outside de

receipts in the Northwest, developed weakness
in wheat. Liverpool quotations were a trifla
higher - before the opening here and buyers
derived some encouragement from this . fact.
There were a few early sales made at Satur
day's closing prices and. in one or two cases
buyers were willing to pay a shade , bettor.
Good crop prospects with -big receipts in the

from the primary market to this country before

fair quantity of currants for August shipment
this would be considerable of a hardship to

NEW YORK. Aug. 26. â The stock market
had a more thorough test to-day than at any
time since the rise in prices set in. The re
sult was not altogether conclusive. The out
side demand for stocks was considerably aug
mented, "as was expected, a. sustained advance
for two weeks and an evident growth of in
terest and Increasing tendency to buy stocks
may always^ be depended on , to produce this
result. Equally a matter of course is the
tendency of the professional traders, who have
been accumulating stocks and carefully nurs
ing the market during the rise, to Include their
holdings on this outside buying, so as to make
sure of a portion of their profits. This process
was very obviously going on during the first
hour of the market to-day, which . was the
most active of the day. Some recession in
prices resulted, but the market on the whole
took the realizing very well and -no serious In
roads were made upon prices. Afterward there
were new advances here and the rest of the
market gave the appearance generally of being
still in the control of the bulls. Buying de
mand, however, became languid and then al
most torpid, and the market proved easily vul
nerable to attack by the professional bears.
In the last hour prices were quite generally
below Saturday's level. A substantial rally
followed, but this again proved somewhat
short-lived, and the closing was Irregular and
quite active with speculative sentiment man
ifestly much unsettled. There were various
favorable factors which aided the bulls in
opening prices higher. The failure of the steel
workers in South Chicago to .strike and the
reports of a conciliatory attempt by the strikers
themselves at a settlement affected not only
the steel stocks, but the whole market. The
rise cf United States Steel in the final deal
ings of 1V4 over Saturday was effective in
checking the raid of the bears. London led
off with good buying of Americans after its
Saturday's holiday. Rumors were rife of com
ing definite announcement of plans growing
out of the Northern Pacific settlement. The
approaching September advance in the price
of anthracite helped the coalers and the Eries
were also affected by the reported acquisition
of the Cincinnati, -Hamilton and Dayton. The
reaction was due to the apprehension that
money was destined to work closer from this
time on. It was feared also that the large in
terests who have been fostering the rising
have taken this opportunity to realize on Sat
urday and this morning and would retire from
the market until- the autumn demands for
money are satisfactory. London has grown
optimistic and expects easy money through the
fall, but the expectation Is based on the hope
that New York will not draw gold and take
no action on the rumored Russian loan at Paris.
Railroad bonds showed a considerable In
crease in activity. Gains were somewhat af
fected by the late reaction in stocks. Total
sales. $2,590,000.- â¢ â¢

G. H. WILLSON, Assistant Section Director.
The London Grocers' Â¦ Gazette of August 10
t*ys: Salmonâ The holidays have somewhat
affected the market for canned goods gen
erally this week, and in this article there has
not been much doing, but prices remain un
sltered. In Liverpool there has been a 'large
consumptive demand for all kinds and great
quantities are going into the country. The
lower prices seem to have induced large sales.
Fi-uits â The fact that the prices for the new
reason's goods are higher than those at pres
ent ruling on the market Is apparently causing
more Inquiry for California fruits on the spot
and prices keep firm.

Professor Bacon said to-day that as far
as he knew the committee would not in
vestigate the rush which occurred Friday
at ' the gymnasium between the sopho
mores on the one hand and the freshmen
and juniors on the other. Official report
of the act has not been made to the com
mittee, and no notjee of the rush will be
taken- unless it is "brought up officially.
In all probability the whole thing will be
dropped, as the material damage has been
paid for' and the broken ' faculty edict
against rushing may be overlooked. ' ,
The students' affairs committee, reor
ganized this teim by President Wheeler,
consists of the following named:
The young men, B. T. McLean and T.
Rowland, both members of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity, escaped prose
cution after arrest because the proprietor
of the store asked for the dismissal of the
cases. Now they must face a trial per
haps more serious than the legal one they
narrowly missed. The result may be ex
pulsion from, college, or they may only bo
expelled for a year or so. However the
investigation may end, the young men are
thoroughly frightened and do not expect
great leniency on the part pf the faculty.
The mirror theft was officially referred
to Professor T. R. Bacon, head of the stu
dents' affairs committee, by President
Wheeler, who requested that it be inves
tigated. Rowland and McLean have been
cited to appear before the committee on

FACULTY TRIAL
MUST BE FACED
Aug. 26.â St. Mary's
ft 11 College is going to take a great
II II deal pf interest in athletic affairs
during the coming' term. The col
, lege opened last week with an un
usually large attendance, and the first
thing that was done by the students was
to organize an athletic association to have
general control of all track and field ath
letic events for the coming: season.
St. Mary's College has always been
strong on baseball, and the team will be
reorganized with but little chanee from
last year. The team last year had the
remarkable record of not having lost a
single game except the first practice game
played. It was victor in every match
game.
The acting Attorney General, in the
opinion just. sent to the Secretary of '.he
Navy, advised him that he is justified In
withholding such approval, to the end
that the questions involved may be judi
cially'determined. ' â¢'
Suit was commenced, in the United
States Circuit Court for the eastern dis
trict of Pennsylvania and a decree en
tered as stipulated in the agreement. Sub
sequently the two steel companies in 1898
made contracts with the ; Government for
the manufacture of the armor plate for
the battleships Illinois and Wisconsin,
which provided that if the steel compa
nies were required to pay "royalty for the
use of the face-hardening process" the
Government should reimburse them, and
the Harvey Steel Company then brought
suit against the Government In the Court
of Claims for an infringement of the pat
ents, and the Government defended on the
grounds indicated by Secretary Herbert.
The Bethlehem Company and the Carne
gie Company, having, paid the royalties
for hardening the armor plate. of the Illi
nois and the Wisconsin to the Harvey
Steel Company, presented a voucher for
the approval of the Secretary of trie
Navy to secure reimbursement, and the
Secretary- requested the opinion of the
Attorney General as to whether he was
justified in withholding his approval until
the case in the Court of Claims involving
the validity of the Harvey patents was
first determined.
The agreement further stipulates that
the steel companies should submit to an
adverse decree for an alleged infringe
ment of the Harvey patents and the issu
ance of an injunction to' restrain them
from the use of the process except under
this license. /
The opinion sets forth that on April 12,
1893, the United States made a 'contract
with the Harvey. Steel Company by whlcn
the Government acquired the right to use
the inventions described as the Harvey
patents by paying a royalty of one-half
of one per cent a pound upon the finished
product. Subsequently Captain Sampson,
then chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, ad
vised the Navy Department that no fur
ther royalties should be paid, as the
process used by the Government through
its contractors in the construction of
armor plate was not the same as that
covered by the Harvey patents, and for
the additional reason that the Harvey
patents were invalid for want of novelty.
On this recommendation Secretary Her
bert in 1S95 refused to pay further royal
ties. In 1897 the Carnegie Steel Company
and the Bethlehem Steel Company took
out a license from the Harvey Steel Com
pany to use its process. in the face-hard
ening of armor plates.- and the contract
stipulated that the steel companies were
under no obligation to pay any royalties
whenever the Harvey Steel Company 'hud
previously granted a license which had in
effect been paid by such Government.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â The Depart
ment of Justice, in an opinion by Acting
Attorney General Beck, has advised the
Secretary of the Navy that he is justified
in withholding his approval of certain
vouchers which have been submitted by
the Bethlehem Steel Company and the
Carnegie Steel Company for royalties
which these companies paid to the Har
vey Steel Company for the use of the
Harvey process In hardening steel and for
which they claim reimbursement from. the
Government under a contract by which
the Government agreed to "pay these roy*
altles to the steel companies if the steel
companies "were required to pay them"
to the Harvey Steel Company. The lia
bility to , pay these royalties has been a
matter of dispute for . some years, and
while the particular royalties only relate
to the hardening 'of the armor : plate for
the battleships Illinois and Wisconsin,, yet
the decision affects all of the royalties
upon the various battleships which have
been constructed since 1893 or under
process of construction. ' :Â¦ . .

HONOLULU, Aug. 20.â Immigration
Commissioner J. K. Brown has received
from Washington a ruling sent by the
Treasury Department to the effect that
Chinese in the United States cannot come
to Hawaii. Two Chinese arrived on the
Marlposa last Friday and were refused
permission to land. Habeas corpus pro
ceedings were brought before Judge Estee
and are now being heard. The ruling un
der wheh the Chinene were held states
that as there Is no provision for regula
tion of travel between the two ports, as
provided for in all other ways, It la to be
presumed that Congress . did not Intend
that Chinese should come from the main
land here. The Chinese from San Fran
ttsco may be sent back.

rOUB COAL MINEES MEET
DEATH IN TERRIBLE FORTH
Feeley has been begging around Oak
land for several months and the police
have been on his trail several times, but
have never been able to put their hands
upon him. When they did get him they
hardly expected to find a man with a
small fortune upon him.
With more than $5000 worth of cash and
securities in his pockets . Thomas Feeley,
the old man who was arrested In this
city yesterday for begging, told Police
Judge Smith that he guessed he was
guilty of both begging and disturbing the
peace of Mr. Jeffries yesterday. On the
charge of disturbing the peace Judge
Smith "gave" the old man $40 or twenty
days, while on the charge of begging he
"gave" him sixty days without any
monetary alternative.
Then the ordinary habitues of the
Police Court were astounded. The old man
called for his property and cut four
ten-dollar coupons off his Government
bonds and handed them to Clerk Hennessy
in pavment of his fine. A Government
bond had never found its way into the
Police Court before to-day, and most of
those who witnessed this act. had only
heard of these documents as valuable
assets that only bankers see.
But when it came to settling up the
sentence upon the charge of begging,
Feeley found that it was a different mat
ter. Judge Smith gave him sixty days in'
the County Jail without ajny alternative,
and the old man was removed to serve
his term.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug 26.
YOKOHAMA, Aug. 10.â The visit to
China of Prince Konoye, the President of
the House of Peers, Is regarded with great
interest as significant of a concert of ef
' fort on the part of the two empires in
behalf of the preservation of the Integrity
of the Continental powers. The Prince is
intensely desirous of bringing about some
such understanding, as ia also the Count
Okuma., the leader of the party to which
he belongs. Their hopes have been some
what dashed, however, by the report re
cently brought back from China by Gozo,
a prominent member of the same organi
zation, which is to the effect that there
is no disposition among the Chinese to
help themselves, so thoroughly have they
been cowed and permeated wjth the spirit
of submission. The 'average Chinaman,
he declares, is ready to bow the head to
any one whom he recognizes as a master.
As this is the theory upon which the Rus
sians have acted, it is easy to predict Into
whose hands the empire will ultimately
fall.
The expression of sympathy on the part
of the court and the native press on the
receipt of the news of the Empress Fred
erick's death is genuine evidence of. the
present good feeling toward Germany.
This is largely owing to the high praise
lavished by German officers upon the Jap
anese troops in China and the favorable
impression which they themselves have
made when visiting here as the nation's
quests. The change of sentiment is, how
ever, none the less extraordinary, inas
much as Japan was hurt to the quick by
being jockeyed into signing the Anglo-
German compact on the direct under-
Ftanding that it included Manchuria and
then learning that any such Interpreta
tion of it was repudiated by Germany it
f The signs of an Improvement In the
\ money market continue. Within the past
' few days the prices of all securities have
shown marked appreciation.
The greatest annoyance and trouble to
foreign tourists continue to happen in
consequence of the rigid enforcement of
the law against taking photographs any
where within the limits of the fortifica
tion zones. As these zones Include very
iarge tracts mainly upon the chief lines
cf travel, the practical result is the al
most absolute prohibition of the use of
the kodak or of any other photographic
Instrument by tourists. Artists also swrill
soon find It Impossible to exploit the coun
try, as sketching is also placed equally
under the ban. .-^ .; -^

PAYS HIS FINE
WITH COUPONS
A new feature with the show this year
is. a military band,, composed of twelve
members. It is led by a miniature drum
.major, and the rest of the band walk on
stilts, each one being higher than his
predecessor. When they line up and ren
der a selection they make a most amus
ing spectacle.
There are marvelous midair trapeze
acts and performing horses and mules,
and the turns succeed each other . so
quickly that it keeps one busy to keep
from missing a clever turn. r Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦'
To close the evening's entertainment
there are thrilling horse races, real jock
eys participating, chariot races and clown
races. The circus is as good as when out
here last year â in fact, in some features
it has been if possible improved.
now three herds of the animals, and their
grotesque attitudes and poses are very
funny.
"The elephants performed and made as
big a hit as they did last year. There are
"I would respectfully call your atten
tion to the world-renowned Da Comas
family. Ringlir.g Bros, have engagfd this
troupe at an enormous expense." The Da
Comas are great, but it is not necessary
-for the big man to yell it out. as San Fran
cisco people know a clever act when they
see it. The Da Comas' family turn has
been done in this city. by other acrobats,
but never as neatly j and with as much
dash and vim. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ - Â¦
There is the usual big man, who an
nounces all the special features in a loud
\oice, something in this way:
daring bareback acts on a lively horse,
and appears later on the programme in a
long skirt and jumps in a bound from the
bare back of a horse, alighting on the
ground in an erect position, which Is a
marvelous act.
CHINESE PEOPLE
NOW SUBMISSIVE
SIX thousand people attended Ring
ling Bros.' circus at the grounds at
Sixteenth and Folsom streets last
evening. The crovrd commenced
pouring in shortly after 7:30, and
at the time tho performance began the
lcng rows of seats presented a tea of
faces. The audience was cosmopolitan
and all nationalities were, represented.
The programme is full of clever and
daring acts. There are five rings, three of
â¢which are constantly in use, and the show
goes with a snap and vimâ in fact, it Is a
continuous performance.
One of the clever stars with the circus
is Miss Amelia Feeley. She makes her
first appearance early in the evening in a.
catchy jockey suit. She performs some

: Though Judge Dunne holds that the evi
dence adduced at the trial of George
Walker, charged with having, embezzled
$80 30 . from" the American Tract Society,
did not warrant the verdict' of guilty,
found In his case in February of 189S, he
filed an - opinion yesterday refusing to
consider the motion filed on behalf of
Walker for a new trial. Judge. Dunne
found 'that an appeal from the judgment
of conviction had been takenrtoo late by
Walker and i that â¢ other legal impedimenta
for a review of his Â¦ case existed. The
court therefore' filed a judgment. refusing
to consider the application for a new
trial. An appeal will be taken from Judge
Dunne's ruling and if this proves ineffec
tual the" merits of ; the case will.be tested
upon an application", for a writ of habeas

brief hearing the court ordered that a

ROKEN in health through the ex
cessive use of morphine, a drift
ing derelict on the sea of life,
Mrs. William E. Sheridan, widow
of the great tragedian and herself
a well known actress, passed away yes
terday alone and forgotten in the squaad
little room she had occupied at 143 Minna
street- Her body was found stretched
upon the shabby cot by a man named
Bowen, who notified the Coroner's offlce,
and the remains of the unfortunate
woman were removed to the Morgue. â¢
As Louise Davenport the dead woman,
twenty years ago, was one of the most
popular actresses In this country and Aus
tralia, her specialty being tragic roles,
and the story of her life is the most
tragic and the most pathetic of all.
Louise Davenport _was born in Toronto,
Canada,~of humble' parents and worked
hard to support herself. She was a beau
tiful girl, and Robert McWade, the well
known actor, was .so impressed with her
appearance that he engaged her to play
minor roles with his company that was
then producing "Rip Van Winkle." Miss
Davenport came to California with Mc-
Wade and toured the coast. While In
Denver In 1SS1 she met William E. Sheri
dan. It was a case of love at first sight
on both sides. Sheridan, who was mar
ried, secured a divorce and soon after
married Louise Davenport in this city.
The two appeared many times together
In leading roles at both the Baldwin and
ELECTRIC CAR

Dr. T. W. B. Leland, who was on a car
following, found that life was not extinct
and ordered the victim to the hospital, but
she' died en route. â¢ , < .'. .-
The body was identified at- the- Morgue
by Thomas Fellows, a neighbor, as that
of Mrs. Lucy A. Simmons of. 911 .Dolores
street. She had a son, LevI .. Simmons,
a customs inspector. Mrs. Simmons was
returning from the home ' of "friends' at
Twenty-fourth and York streets when
.she was killed. : Â¦Â¦' . . Â¦.
her the woman stepped forward again,
and before an accident' could be averted
was struck and knocked- to the pavement.
Louise Davenport after Sheridan's denth
was never the same woman. Overcome
with grief at the loss or her husband, she
began to wither and her beauty, gradually
disappeared. She returned ,from Austra
lia and retired from the. stage. In 1S94
old California theaters. Old theater-goers
claim that Sheridan as Louis XI, assisted
by his wife, gave the greatest treat in the
mummers' art ever given in this . clty.^
Their success was world wide, and they
accepted i an engagement to appear in
legitimate roles in Australia. They sailed
for the scenes of their fresh triumphs in
the fall of 1SS4. When Sheridan arrived
in Australia success turned his head arid
he entered upon a career of dissipation
and riotous living, as a result of which his
health became, impaired. He died siirl
denly in the Royal Theater at Sydney.-
Australia, while witnessing a performance .
from a box. His wife at that time was
filling an engagement at Adeialde. but she
arrived in Sydney two hours after his
death. Â¦

There Is still remaining subject to the
jurisdiction of the court the sum of $380,

adjudication of the claims of Mrs. Nettle
R. Craven. This money will not leave the

necessarily elapse before the Fair estate
emerges from litigation and enters
history.

fees presented by ex-Supreme Court Jus

dered on behalf of the so-called minor
heirs, the children of the children of the

A few hundred thousand dollars were
distributed among the executors of the
will of the late James G. Fair and the
attorneys who have represented them

Judge Troutt yesterday. The distribution
of fees preceded the filing of a supple
mental account by the executors, a form
ality -which will be indulged in by the
executors, assisted by their attorneys,
every few months until the final decrees,
relating to the claims of Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven and those of the children of the
dead millionaire, are filed.

The name of Daniel V. Kelly of the firm
of Liebes & Kelly has been added to the
list of Republican candidates for Mayor.
He waft a member of the Gommittee of
One Hundred called together to discuss
the new- charter provisions. He was
chairman of- the committee to which was
assigned the duty of preparing sections
relating to the .police department.
Several of the district delegations of the
Republican camp will caucus this week to
consider topics relative to the organiza
tion of the convention. The Horace Da
vis Club of the' Forty-first District will
meet Thursday evening. Another confer
ence of independent anti-boss delegates
will be held at Native Sons' Hall, on
Seventeenth street, next. Friday evening. t
Delegates. to the Republican Municipal
Convention are closely observing the pro
gress of political . events in the labor
camp. ,It is quite well understood that
Hearst expects to take charge of the La
bor party and use it as an -instrument to
club Phelan and McNab into political in
sensibility. The shrewdest of the labor
leaders suspect that some purpose other
than desire to assist worklngmen ani
mates the. Interested politicians.
The Republicans expect that Dr. O'Don
nell will be in the field as a candidate for
Mayor. The Socialists have already nom
inated a. ticket. While there is not much
in the outlook to cheer the old liners of
the Democratic fold it is reasonably sure
that the McNab-Phelan convention will
nominate a full list of candidates and
make a fight to preserve the organization
for future use. .The present signs point to
four candidates for Mayorâ the Republi
can nominee and three others.
The Republican Camp.
'The Social' Democratic \ party N has
changed Its name to Socialist party, not
desiring to seem" at all affiliated' with the
Democrats. It purposes to enter the local
campaign with greater zeal than ever.
Meetings will shortly be called in the va
rious Assembly districts to organize clubs
for political work. Considerable elation is
felt by the Socialists over the selection of
condidates, and confidence is expressed in
their ability to hold their present position
of third party. . Some even predict that If
the Union Labor party indorses the So
cialist ticket Democracy will be forced to
the rear. ' â¢"".'Â¦
-There are. dissensions In the labor camp.
Many, of the unions refuse to elect dele
gates to" the Union Labor party conven
tion," called to meet at Metropolitan Tem
ple September 6. Only thirty of the 128
unlontf'ln San Francisco have chosen dele
gates. Men have been appointed or elect
ed to represent the machinists. 'cooks and
waiters, hackmen, cloakmakers, milkmen,
bakers, ...brewere,' shoemakers and team
sters. The largest delegation is from the
Machinists'. Union. It transpires that
many of the delegates already chosen par
ticipated In' the recent Â¦ primary election,
and therefore cannot under -the law sign
a petition for independent nominations.
Unions Intending to send .delegates have
been advised by their leaders to elect men
who did not take part in the primary
election. ' j- - â¢â¢â¢ . ; -
