MY EXPERIENCES AS A
PROFESSIONAL
BEGGARHINESE boys and girls have their
(f games that they play with Just as
,\s^ much enthusiasm as do their
American cousins. One of, these is
-"the hawk catching young chickens." The
children stand ,one behind thÂ£ other, j hav
ing the largest boy to protect them from
the hawk. The hawk, the child who, as
we say in "most games, is" "it,"* rornos to
catch! the chickens, but the line uwlngH
back and forth and the protector keepB
between the brood and the hawk. An
other game is "pointing at the moon or
stars." The children "form themselves
into a ring,' with one of their numUor
blindfolded in the center. ThÂ« line moves
around, the players singing. Tuq rlntf
stops and the boy in , tho center pointa.
The person toward whom ' lie points must,
take his place blindfolded in the center.
Â¦Another game is "kicking tho marble."
The players have two* marbles an inch or
more in. diameter, one of which is put
upon the ground and .shoved with the
Â¦ foot. The other; is put do wn and one boy .
tells the other to put it In a' certain dlroc-,
tion' from'the other.. If ;he shoves it so aÂ»'
to hit the other and still goes In tho de
sired direction he wins double and Is en
titled to .two ! kicks. If- it simplv goes in

address as "brothers."
They include Masons, Odd Fellows and
Knights of Pythias, the three great se
cret orders, and at one time these beggars
were actually in good standing in their,
respective orders. They know the secret
work right enough, and by long and con
tinuous practice become adepts. They Can
tell a stranger two blocks away, and they
go after only s'ich brothers (strangers) as
wear the emblem of the order. They give
a fictitious name arid lodge, teW a hard
luck story, are rarely asked about their
standing and never get less than Jl, and
frequently make a touch for a V/
- They beg their brethren by day and
revel by night. They keep tab "on the daily
arrivals at the New Western, Golden
West, Grand, Russ and Lick, and, like
the genteel letter writers who hang about
the Palace Hotel, they are the most suc
cessful and affluent beggars in the city.

the list of 5000 names given afterward
voted me by the Big Cash Beggars' As
sociation, of which one Cornelius Harvey
was secretary.
; To induce me to follow up the profes
sion, it was explained to me at the time
that there was only one way a fellow
like me could live in San Francisco, as
there was no work for strangers, espe
cially for Eastern and Southern men "for
whom the California Native Sons of the
Golden West had but contempt and pre
judice." Further, they persuaded- me that
I would have "to pack my bed on my
back, sleep among the animals in the
barns and eat a poke-out on the ranch
kitchen doorstep and work sixteen hours
per day.'-* : v
I was then put next to the national and
benevolent societies, given the necessary
details and story to tell. ; :' .

The blase girl cleared her throat like a
professor about to begin a lecture. "In
the first place,"- she observed, "there is
the preliminary stage, but I won't dwell
on that, because no' woman of the world
looks back on it otherwise than with pain.
I refer to the age when she" didn't care
what she had on, so long as it was'com
fortable; the time when she wanted pock

face, there is one other thing which pro

change in this respect. Her gowns are
less - elaborate, perhaps, but strange and
weird colorings make their appearance.

The Blase Girl and the
DEBUTANTE TALK DRESS.
* ? 'It is easy enough to distinguish a girl
who is in this period. She has had expe
rience, and she uses it-for all it Is worth.
Her gowns are usually models of chic and
aplomb, and they are distinctly made to
suit the masculine taste. The colorings
are most complex, too. For instance, she
buys a white chiffon dotted with pale yel
low. In the ruffle period she would have
had it made over the same color or white,
~ but in the experienced stage it goes over
the palest of pale blue taffeta, and it is
profusely trimmed with wicked looking
black insertion and bits of- pale blue,
black and yellow chiffon. If she marries
at this period she usually weda a rich
man and astonishes . her friends by tho
artistic beauty of her gowns. It she still
remains single she poses as a woman
with a history and wears accent go*ois
and black spangled princess effects." " -.
"My goodness!" exclaimed the debu- â¢
tante. ' "But then," she added, after a
pause, "you can't fit everybody's life into
'just such periods."
Â¦ 'Tcrhaps not," drawled the 'blase girl,
"but yon'd be surprised to see how many
people do fit. Of course there are excep
tions; "-. Artists, for instance. ThÂ© ' first
thine a successful artist or authoress
does is to drop her corset, and the second
is to get an esthetic teagown. a medie
val one if possible, and made of colors no
one else wears. It must have lots of'flop
py â¢ effects, too, and tags of lace and'rib
bon that don't mean anything. Then
there is usually an intense look In the
eyes which gees with that . costume and a
Botticelli arrangement of the hair."
"You spoke of girls who wore roses In
their hair and white gowns which but
toned down the back. What do you
mean?" asked the debutante anxiously.
The blase girl fixed a pair of solemn
eyes upon her. "Beware of thÂ© girl who
wears that combination!" she exclaimed
tragically. "She is the false Ingenue and
her age may be anywhere from 20 to 30.
But she has had experience and is a very
serpent of wisdom. No real younÂ» girl
ingenue could possibly wear sucn a cos
tume with any effect. Sho would look
like a dowdy. Besides, the youn* girl
does not cultivate any such effects. Â¦ Her
tastes run too much to frills. The, demurÂ©
girl who tucks a rose behind her ear and
who affects white Is merely setting a trap
for some unwary man. As a rule. It is a
trap which does not" fail." 5.f*,&
""And what about colors? Do they mean
anything?"
"Do they?" repeated the blase girl sar
castically. "Oh, no! Of course not! Just
try and see. For instance,- play the In
genue some evening when you are wear
ing a red net "gown and watch how you
don't -succeed. On the other hand, put on
a pale blue muslin and see How easy It
will be to make people believe In you. Be

ruffles and your reputation as a coquette
â¢ is established. On the other hand, affect
grays and mouse colorings and you may
do about what you please. Why, even.
dress materials talk"
"Nonsense!"
"Nonsense, if you will, but Isn't white
muslin connected in your mind with girl
ishness? Doesn't challie stand for slm

Broadcloth for wealth and a fat income?

tpraks of the- danger that threatens thÂ« t
park from the accumulation of under
growth and dead trees. Colonel Rucker
is much interested in the -future of thÂ«
Xatior.a! Park and feels . that its proper
preservation means much to the State ot
California.
"There iÂ« undoubtedly great danger
.from fire in the Yosemite National Park."
said Colonel Rucker.' "We were very
lucky last year in that we discovered thÂ»
only flres that broke out before they had
gnined any great headway. It is only a
question cf time before some flre will
start where a military patrol does not
diqp^yer it at once and there will be great
destruction of trees. Thl3 danger increases
as campers penetrate deeper into .the
national park, aa they are doing every
year. There is a growing inclination upon,
the part of venturesome campers to get
oft the fceaten road?, and the danger from
their carelessly left campnres is â¢ a con
stant menace to the safety of the park
umier the present" cctid!tions of young
undergrowth and dead timber.
"There Is much that is necessary to be
done in the National Park, and the clear
ing of the floor is one thing- And what
applies to the National Park applies to
the State Park in the valley proper,
though the Federal authorities* have no
control over this section. There have been
vast accumulations of fallen trees. On

"It would seem to me that it would be
money well spent if both the Federal and
State authorities should spend money
enough to burn over at least the danger
ous sections of the parks.
"Under the present rules fires cannot ha
started in the park, and underbrush can
not be cut or burned. But campers will
build fires and the patrols are too scatter
ed over the large area to prevent them.
The rule against cutting underbrush has
alowed a healthy growth of small trees
that would act as kindling woud for the
larger trees in the event 'of a flre. Â¦ It
would be manifestly improper . to allow
promiscuous fire building in the Park

"The first time I went to the Yosemite,
which was forty-one years ago, I partic
ularly noticed how few fallen- trees there
were and how clean and green. the forest
looked. Most of the psople going through
made remarks upon its fine condition,- and
some would go so far as to say, that It was
the finest forest they had ever seen. It
would-remind, them' of .beautiful parks. 1 In
those days all kinds of trees flourished and
all looked healthy. * T*hen the trees were
taken care of by thenative sonsâ the 1 In
dians â who burned the forest over -every
three or four years," thus keeping' down"
the undergrowth. They did not have any,
laws among .'their .tribes that prevented
any of them from making, a flre as the
white man has. The Indians made the flres
and now the white man fights to keep the
tires out. . ...
- "I firmly denounce .this present 'method
of forestry. They hold meetings,' discuss
various theories pertaining' to; forestry,
make it -'punishable by a fine for. any one
to make a fire, look wise, and claim that
they are foresters. Those that keep the
flres out should be; fined Instead of those
Â¦that make the fire. It is impossible to
keep fire outâ it is bound to Â¦â¢ go through,
even, by lightning. In that case, who could
be fined? If the forest is clean very little
damage can be done, and the. fire can soon
be checked. .; "...-. '... ; ,:

BELIEVES IN A
SYSTEM OF
RANGERS.
Zy C. J". tteuhalU United

ent of Northern California,
THE accumulation of dead trees and
leaves In the Yosemite Park Is. of
course, a constant source of danger.
The place Is carefully patrolled by
soldiers, but in general I do not be
lieve them as efficient fire-fighters as the
experienced rangers employed in the Gov
ernment forest reserves. ' - -'-
There are three kinds of flres and they
must be dealt with In different ways. (The

the fire Is more dangerous and requires
harder work to back fire and clear out
the debris in order to stop the flames. If
the blaze gets in among the tree tops and
there is a good winJ blowing; but little
can be done.
We have found the system of rangers
as used by the Government very success
ful. Last summer over the four or five
millions of acres in the northern reserves
there were 105 flres reported and put out.
There was no serious blaze, ,*".'-

FREQUENT FIRES
THE LESS THE

Zy J. H.Â£e Conte. Jnstruc'.or

sity of California and an
Active Member of the Sierra
Club.
FIRES In forests are like fires In
cities, they must come some time.
The longer they are put off the
worse they will be. It Is said th-
Indlans formerly burned over the
Tosemlte every year. Whether this could
be done now without destroying the
standing timber I do not know, but it
feemt to me that the oftener a fire goes
through a forest the less daxflage is done.
If the fire 1b kept out year after year
*rhen it finally does come the destruction
Is rreat. This is the way with the Yose
xnlte Park; should a fire break out there
this summer, and it may come at any
time, the destruction would bÂ« frightful.

by sawmills. Many of these" areas He
next to fine forests and if a fire should
happen to start in this refuse matter
there would be very little hope for savins
the surrounding forests. : Â¦ . i .--
A simple remedy for this would be to
destroy the refuse matter as: soon as a
tree is cut down. By doing this the aban
doned areas would be left in a safe con
dition. : â¢ : \:
Burning the forest over every few years
might call forth the argument that/by so
doing the leaf mold is destroyed. It Is
claimed that this leaf mold acts as a
sponge and retains the moisture and
helps feed the mountain streams. This
may be true with the Eastern forests,
where rains are frequent, but not so in
California, where there Is such a Ions dry
spell. Many parts do not receive any. rain
for four or five months -and during that
time all the undergrowth and debris in
the forest Is in a parched condition.
In what condition did the white man
first find the .Yosem'te? Was his sight
marred by the superabundance ot under
growth? The valley was eatlre.'y free
from underbrush and every portion of it
could be distinctly seen. The floor resem
bled a huge gTeen carpet, dotted every
where with Innumerable varieties of wild
flowers. All the different species of trees
presented a healthy and thriving appear
ance. No dead_ trees blemished the neat
ness of the scene.
Since this was before the white man,
who were its protectors and how did they
protect It to keep It In such an excellent
condition? Nature's own childrenâthe'In
diansâwho had instilled into them
through the laws of nature the true In
stincts of forestry. Had it not been for
the Indians the Yosemite and the Na
tional Park would not be the beautiful
country it is to-day. The Indians grew up
In the forest; the forest was their home;
they were part of the forest and they
loved, it with all the devotion of their
souls. They. not only loved the forest but
looked upon it for their support; each tree
was valuable to them in some way. The
oak furnished them the staff of life, the
acorn bread; the pine supplied the pine
r.ut and sugar pine. The oily, nutritious
substance .found in the plnenut was as
necessary to their systems as butter Is
to us, and the saccharine quality found In
the sugar ;>ine was also a very important
essential. The fir provided the balsam, an
Invaluable panacea for all ills, and so It
was with all. the numerous species of
treesâ each one was priceless for what it
furnished. ......
In one way the Indians may be consid
ered the farmers of the big trees. They
watched over the forest as our present
farmer watches over his crops and or
chards. The white man admires the for
est for its beauty and game, but with the
Indian it was his life.
Now, as to the Indian method of farm-
Ing. They did not allow this accumula
tion of debris, but every few years the
chiefs called the various tribes together
and held consultation and cleaned the for
ests out by fire, thus destroying -all the
umlerwood and making the large trees
healthy and clean. In a few months grass
and flowers would spring up where the
debris was lying and the whole forest re-
sombiecJ some beautiful park. ,
One of the. oldest books relating to
American forestry In" the British Museum
has- a statement in quuint old English
spying: "The Indians do. in th= moist
St. Mai tin's summertime, when the leaves
have fallen,* set fire to the leaves, and so
do not only prevent great fires In the dry
season, _but they do burn away the under
wood, so that you may ride to the hounda
as in an English park." This little state
ment gives _the condition of the forest
several hundred- yearr. ago. when the In
dian? â¢> were the foresters and theforests
were as clean as English parks. It also
applies directly to Yosemite and the Na
tional Park. : They, were found in this
condition not many years ago, when thÂ«
Indian's held full sway In these regions.
At a meeting held by the Yosemite Com
missioners several years ago In the val-
CT~*TT: T^rrr-**; r;'!rr.al Park to; In
I danger of being destroyed by fire.
I Owing to the accumulation of
J^ dead trees, cJtcayed underwood
ard the excessive growth of un
derbrush the park is in an inflammable
condition.
A spark caused by lightning, a smold
ering fire, supposed to be put out by
campers, can destroy the whole forest
that has been growing for thou?a?ios .if
years. Very often thunderstorms occur
In this region during the long dry reason?
â¢ nd^nany trees are struck by lightn n~.
If the sparks happen to catch the accum
ulated mass of dry debris a forest fire
would be immediately begun, and in a
f'nort time it would reach such a hea-lwa:.'
that it would be impossible ;o put It out
before much damage would be donÂ« to thÂ»
forest. : ' Â¦'- . ' :.v: . ... ' â¢ .'.
For years the foro<t has been accumu
lating underwood and when dead -treÂ«"Â»
have fallen they ha\e been allowed to re
ir.ain and de^ay on the ground until the
whole forest resembles one grand "jun-
In places a person can hardly se? nvÂ£r
fifty yards on aecariu cf tlie superabund
ance of undergrowth, and hard'y a dis
tance can be traver?-d ten feet without
rnc^nterir.g some fullen tree to climi>
over. In ir.any plaoÂ« s deaa trees have
fallen against magnificent live ones ami
ere leaning again.*: ihfm far support.
This would give the flames ample spojv'
to lick the tops of gigantic trees. Under
the conditions that exist after ten year*
cf accumulation of dead trees and under
brush it will be impossible to much Jons^t
keep fire out of the great park. :
It is bound to star: in some way or an
other, and ence under good headvay it
would sweep the park from end to end.
Yet by allowing the forest to -'. get in;.;
this condition it is claimed that it is be
ing preserved, whei- in reality no better
means could be employed for destroying
it- To make a fire every few year? and
destroy the underwood would be consM
cred vandalism by some, and would
iiover do under the ; resent method adopt
ed for the preservation of the forests.
An example of this would be to have i
hoir.e in the country, surrounded by In
flammable debris, siid not insure it. but
make it a fine for any one to make a
fire in Its vicinity, if a fire, was one;
s-tarted nothing couM have the house. This
case is especially true with many
houses and towns d?stroyed by fire last
year in Michigan and Wisconsin. The ad
jacent country around these towns
was filled with refuse matter left by
paw-mills, and by tlie sheer neglect of
burning this dry waste material fires
started and gaine-i such control that
towns and villages Lave been swept out
of existence.

At that time it was not thought possi

nian- and ambitious. There was the
chance of a lifetime to present a "Passion
Play" under the auspices of the fathers
of the Society of Jesus, with actors who
had been trained in a Christian college. â¢

from evil to good; to make it the niedium
of reaching those to whom sermons do
not appeal. â¢
A' year ago, when first they began plans
for tlie : "celebration of the fiftieth year's
commencement exercises, the president of
the college, Rev. Robert E. Kenna, wrote
to Clay M. Greene, the dramatist, who
had 'been his classmate at the college in
1867, and asked him for some play of the
scrt which should entertain and instruct.

Yet the power of the stage is great for
good, and the Jesuits at Santa Clara are
showing hov/ the presentation of the spec

a stronger sermon for conversion than can
be preached from a pulpit. For the brain

space between. â¢ . : .
The electrical light controlling, devices
are. the chief boast of the stage mechan
ics, who pride themselves on the fact that
in no other theater In America can such
marvelous results be obtained. The cur
rent used is an alternating one, which is
transmitted â¢ from the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, ISO miles away, at a line pres
sure of 60,000 volts. At San Jose the cur
rent is transformed down from 60,000 volts
to 1000 volts, and brought out to the the
ater at" that â¢ pressure, where it Is again
transformed to the various pressures re
quired by transformers, choke coils and
series wiring.
The use of choke colls in the rheostats
instead of resistance of the ordinary form
ajlows holding/ the current at any stage
in the lighting circuits for any length of
time without danger of undue heating,
which so often gives serious trouble when
heavy currents are to be carried for long
periods. ' . *
Three colors are useu in the foot and
overhead lights, as well as the ground
and bunch lights. Each of these three
colors has its own rheostat and can bÂ«
'put at any Intensity, from the faintest
dull glow of bare Incandescence, though
by imperceptible decrease, to full candle
power. In this way it Is possible by
working combinations of colors to get allv
of the faint delicate blue grays and rose
tints, the purples and violet colors of eve
and dawn, all brought on in the absolutely
Imperceptible rate at which nature does
it. Instead of coming by Jerks as sudden
as the blowing out of a lamp, which more
nearly approaches the usual theatrical ef
fect.
Much of the action of the play depends
upon the lighting, for the halo of the Sa
vior must be remembered, and whenever
his presence Is Indicated the lighting ef
fects do their part In carrying out the Il
lusion. ''?C>';
All through the New Testament it -yrm
be remembered that optical phenomena
are referred to, and Mr. Greene has made
the most of the possibilities.
It 13 the weird effect of unexpected light
that Is used to create the Impression of
the presence of the Savior without his ap
pearance on the stage, and the most strik
ing example of this is on the march to
the crucifixion, when behind a wail at the
back of the stage Is seen slowly passing:
the cross, which he himself bears, and
shining on it continuously from below the
halolike light of the "bunch" glare, whlca
is carried simultaneously. Whenever the
Savior is indicated as appearing in view
from those on the stage, a" light illumines
them from the direction' of his presence.
Almost would an .unbeliever of the pres
ent day wonder which 19 the greater mira
cle, that a light should radiate directly
from the person of a man or that a tum
bling, snow-fed torrent 200 miles away In
the high Sierras' should send this blazÂ»
of light over a rod of clay-formed alumi
num, to glow or dim at the touch of the
wizard at the switchboard.
The surroundings of the theater are such
as to make It peculiarly fit for the pre
sentation of a solemn play of this sort.
The ground on which it stands and all
about is almost, solid mold of the first
Christians of the , West- The California
Indians, nearly all of them of Western
California at least, were buried In and.
around these missions. By the ten thou
sand they are there, and, according to
their own custom which they grafted upon
the Christian burial, the tombs are all un
marked. It would .have been according to
Indian ethics a mark of the greatest dis
respect to place a tombstone. The mother
who could not remember where her son
was burled or the son who forgot where
lay his ancestor when came the day of
the dead and the time for burning a can
dle above him would have been indeed a
faithless mourner. It was their pride that
they remembered the spot of the inter
ment of each deceased relative. But now
the race is gone and over their unmarked
graves there are none to mourn, except
as the pious fathers say each night at
half past 8, when tolls the dead bell, "Da
Profundls" for all deceased.
Not only is the theater thus standing
upon a vast cemetery but It adjoins the
old Franciscan church, which was built
by the earlier followers of Junlpero Serra,
and still remains, used daily by the wor
shipers. Built ..on to the church In two
directions are * the old mission buildings,
-which form part of the quadrangle, and
surrounding the quadrangle are the va
rious halls 'of learning which constitute
tl.e college that the fathers maintain.
Every part in the play will be taken
either by students of the college or by
alumni, of whom many have risen to
prominence.
In the center of the panoramic picture,
in which the theater is shown on the
right, will be seen a tall white cross. This
is a wooden casing which surrounds the
original cross that was the first stick
erected by the Franciscans. The old cross
is still to be seen through a glass plate let
Into the side of the boxing. It 1s of un
palnted redwood, and, like all of the heavy
timbers in the old mission, .was carried on
the shoulders of the Indian converts from
the mountains which He back of the flat
valley of the mission as do themountaina
lie back of the little plain In .which is set
the village of Oberammergau.
Around. this cross in the century before
the last took" place the 'allegorical plays
of the Indians, which .were half mixtures
of their 'old' war dances and of their
strange conceptions of Christianity, which,
were, as they themselves were, serious,
deep, and reverent beyond our flippant
comprehension. So much has been said oÂ£
the low order of the Californian Indiana
that it has coma to be believed, despite the
fact that their works remain to prove
them of ability - possessed by few abor
igines now living. The frescoing on the
Mission Church celling was done by full
blooded Indian converts. While as art It
is lacking, yet there is a heavy, solemn,
pro-Raphaellte realism to It that awes

"order to give the scenic' features required

'parted it was. necessary to; cut away 'all
of the old "gridiron" and build a new one
several feet higher. , This was possible, as
â¢; the .' fly gallery did ' not _ take all of the
'" height of the building. The depth of the

when crowded to. its . standing-room ca
pacity; has contained over 2500. There are
125 ' persons on the stage in. the present
production, of whom "nearly one-half have
speaking parts.
The "exterior of the building is shown in
the extreme right of* the panoramic view.
It is three stories in height, of pure Ionic
' architecture, even to the ground plan. The
'entire building is devoted to. the theater,
having no other rooms within it. The
auditorium has a steeply sloping floor, as
ls'usual, but,^what is hot so common in
this country, although more so in France,
Is that the stage is also steeply inclined
toward the footlights.
, The fathers of the Jesuit College at
Santa Clara built, ' own and manage this
theater, and, as will be; seen from the
photographs, take part in assisting in the
rehearsals.
"For the last iwo months Mr. O'Sullivan
and myself, together with the electrical
engineering corps of .the college, have
worked continuously on the mechanical,
scenic and electrical effects, until I can

there should exist a theater, with all Its
paraphernalia, under the management of
and supported by* a church.

O'Sulllvan, also 'an alumnus, who was at
the time doing landscapes in Europe.
. "After completing the -dramatization of

In the photograph of this scene Mr.
Greene is seen occupying the throne of
Herod for the time, Herod, also, like
Matthew, having overworked himself
with studies and play acting.
The flashlight vas taken just at the
time that Herod was saying "Kill every
body" and the mob is begging for mercy.
To give the various methods by which
the presence of the Savior is suggested
would be impossible. Sometimes it Is
the cross in the distance, again a light
frim: his halo Illumines the stage. At
another time Pilate beckons him to ap
pear, and the curtain falls just as the
light announcing his coming is culminat
ing' its Intensity.
The strongest scene of all is probably
that where Judas discovers the results
of his betrayal of Christ, j
He comes on the stage solus.
"Aye, Sadoc."
"But why are you and I alone awake.
When all our kin and kine are dreaming?"
They go on to discuss the report of the
miracles at the birth of Christ, all but one
expressing more and more of doubt, when
suddenly the angel appears in a bla^e of.
light and shames them on their lack of
faith, then points to the Star of Bethle
hem, which suddenly blazes forth In the
distance, glowing fiercely with the energy
of the Sierran waterfall that lights it.
The scene goes on, in its quietness one
of the most beautiful of the % whole ten.
In the distance the camp-fires of other
shepherds twinkle electrically. In the sky
bright stars glitter. They > are a special
design of star invented by Mr. O'Sullivan
and they twinkle and glitter with much
more effect than the real ones.
While the shepherds are discussing the
visit of the angel the moon rises, but the
star of Bethlehem remains fixed, so show
ing its true character to the shepherds,
who, in those days, were the. astronomers
of the country by reason of 'their habits
of observation, acquired* during their
night vigils in caring for their flocks.
To them come the wise men of the east,
who, by the way. are in this case real
wise men and from farther; east than
the Bible writers dreamed: fox they are
Filipinos', who are studying medicine
and political economy.
The play goes smoothly for a rehearsal,
and with so little Interruption that .Mr.
Greene times it to set the acting time.- Â».
The second scene shows the interior of
Herod's palace, where his spies return,
reporting that the holy family had fled,
and thereupon Herod issues his famous
orocr for the slaughter of all the first

"What, thou too Ele<*piess. Shadrach?"
Fiocks and herds are about; and over
sleepers, sheep and all Is the pale blue
starlight. One of the sleepers stirs, and
to him Sadoc says:

and coming across the State to shine on
the mimic mountains of canvas and light
ing them so truly that they seem no less
real than the Sierras themselves.
"Shepherds, on the stage!" orders Father
Ford, and there is a scrambling of assort
ed boys and young men to their places.
Soon all are sunk In the fiction of slumber
and posed by Mr. Greene as a mother dis
poses of a somnolent baby. Then with
another call from the priestly prompter,
Sadoc, another shepherd, enters, and the
rehearsal begins.
"Now bring up your blue a little. Now
a little white in It. Xot so much. That's
It, Xow bring them both up together."
Gradually the light intensifies until ob
jects on the stage are plain. It is the cold
blue ghost light that comes before the
true dawnâ "The phantom of false morn

It shines on the hills of Bethlehem and

O'SullIvan's hands together with a ring-
Ing slap as a signal to the men away up
in the ship-like mass of rigging ropes in
the fly-gallery. Rocks and houses are
checked just in time to save them from
crashing through the stage floor.
"Xow the wing-drops here! Now the net
there!" Then away rushes O'Sullivan to
the dark end of the auditorium to watch
effects.
"Lights out!" he calls back, and with a
flash of the switchboard the house is In
darkness.
"Turn on your blue." â¢ '
A creepy phosphorescent light Is over
everything.
Mr. Greene keeps his eyes on gestures
and positions and his ears on enunciation.
Father Ford, in cap and gown, prompts
and corrects elocution. Mr. O'Sullivan
watches the scene setting and the light
ing effects to bring out the color schemes,
which have been as carefully planned for
their effect on the spectator as have the
choruses and tableaux.
A full rehearsal is a busy scene. It
beats a three-ring circus if you try to take
in everything at once. Mr. Â¦ Clay Greene,

over the. stage; so are actors, citizens, sol
diers, priests of the temple and Wise Men

home In bed. recuperating from overstudy,
which, however, had put him successfully
to the front both as student and actor.
Father Ford was working days. in the col
lege, morning and evening in the church
and nights in the theater. Any one : who
thinks that those in a monastery lead a
quiet, useless life will be much mistaken.
They run the busiest kind of a thinking
shop.
But "from limitations come freedom,
and Irom obstacles success." The very
troubles which beset the paths- of these
two sets of pctors seem to make their
work the better and in its peculiar way
to impress more strongly than the finished
art of the professional.
Rehearsals begin at 7 in the evening,
p.fter the end of the college day, and last
until 10 or 11. At 6 in the morning all
must be up and at their studies again.
Clay Greene says that his part of the
work In planning stage alterations and In
changing his drama to suit the require
ments of actual production, drilling the
boys in their work and making actors out
of raw material has been delightful play
to him; and Mr. O'Sullivan, recalled from
Europe to paint the scenery, has found
equal pleasure in transferring to* canvas
for his alma mater the scenes which he
witnessed In his travels.
Although every one in the theater is a
member of the college and thoroughly
amateur, the author elone excepted, long
practice has given them a proficiency
which eends things along with the meth
odical swing of the professional. The
scene shifters, fly gallery men and supers
are selected apparently from the football
team for their muscular ability, and
"Judas," too, throws on the
ground as no one ever could who had not
bc-*>n trained by a football coach instruct
ing for a "low tackle."
Acting the Passion Play is to the Santa
Clarans. as to the Oberammergauers, an
avocation which must not be allowed to
Interfere with daily duties. While Cai
phas. Judas and Herod in the village by
the Axnmer are distracted from the dra
matic studies by their various duties as,
Echnltzers. Kellners, or whatever their
humble work may be, so the youthful
Christians at the old mission are equally
diridlng their energies between studying
the!r parts and cramming their heads for
or passing- examinations In their college
work. My first introduction to Jechonias
was in meeting him rushing frantically
about the peaceful quadrangle, [ beneath
the broad leaved palms and shady, fig
trees, a book of the play in one hand and
a geometry in the other; a rehearsal and

7THE SXJNDAT;: CALL. (

AT SANTA CLARA COLLEGEONE instance of bloodshed only can
be recorded, and in that no blame
â¢;' seems to attach to the company.
About 1876 the settlers, 000 in num
ber, petitioned Congress to restore a por
tion of the; land grant to the public, no
railroad hiving been constructed on the
route between Hollister, in San Benitd
County, and Goshen in Tulare County, a
distance of 140 miles. They represented
that for a distance of fifty miles the
route lay over a level, sandy waste of
little value, until by irrigating canals,
constructed at their own expense, it had
been reclaimed and made fruitful; .that
subsequent to these : improvements the
railroad company surveyed its line, and
asked for patents to the odd sections,
some of which were already occupied.
Congressional committees reported some
fcr and some against a forfeiture, of ,the
lands, and the matter remained undeter
mined until 1878, eleven years after the
land was granted. In April of that year
a. mrss meeting , was called at Hanford,
in this region, where a settler's league
was organized. The league expressed
itself as willing to pay the price fixed by
tho Government for railroad lands,
namely $2 50 per acre; but declared the
railroad company had 1 no right to their
homes and improvements, nor any right
to require payment for the same from
those who had made the Improvements.
On a demand from the league to have
their land-grader removed, the â¢ railroad '
company brought suits of ejectment
against the settlers on Its patented lands,
and obtained judgment -in the United
States Circuit Court in December. Pre
vious to this decision, however, eighty or
a hundred men, with masks to conceal
their identity, repaired to the house of.
Ira; Hodge, a purchaser of railroad land,
five miles from Hanford, and ordering out
the family, burned down the dwelling.
Another purchaser, Perry C. Phillips, was
treated in the same manner, and a settler
placed in possession. * . Soon after these
acts a military company was formed. In
July, 1S79, a party of men. mounted and
disguised, made a midnight visit to a
house where it: was suspected that certain
obnoxious persons were lodged. :.Â¦ Their
visit was. taken as a menace. In May, 1880,
no compromise having been effected,
United States Marshal Poole, In'under
taking to place purchasers of 'railroad
lands In possession, was resisted by an
ar J ne , d ce> and a battle resulted In
which eight persons were killed, namely:
James Harris, Iver Knutson, J. W Hen
derson, Archibald . McGregory, Daniel
Kelly and E. Haymaker, settlers, and
Walter J Crow and M. D. Hartt, pur
chafeers of railroad lands. - '
It was shown at the inquest that at the
time of the collision' Marshal Poole in
company with the land grader Clark, and
Â¦ Crow and Hartt, purchasers of railroad,
lands, had set out in the street the house
hold goods of W. B. and was
procecalng to evict other families The
Coroner's jury resolved that "the respon
sibility of the shedding of innocent blood
rests upon the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, ' and the feeling throughout the
State was strongly adverse to the com
pany s course. It was shown, however
upon the trial of those persons engaged
in resisting the Marshal that the settlers
had set themselves up as the rightful
owners, regardless of the patents held by
the railroad company, and had organized
a military force, which patrolled the
streets on horseback with masks - over
their faces; that they warned away 6ne
purchaser of 1 ailroad land, turning the
. occupant out of doors; that it was not
known who was the attacking \ party on
the fateful 10th of May, but that the set^
.tiers deliberately murdered Crow after the
first fury of the fight was over. But such
was the sentiment regarding the right of
the Southern Pacific Company to hold the
land grant that the only crime charged
against the men who participated in the
tragedy of Brewer's rancho was that of
resisting the United States Marshal For

HERE they are!" A half-dozen
voices uttered the cry at once.
There could be no mistake this
time. A buggy drawn by two
horses came into view around the curve
of the road. Three riders accompanied it.
and behind it, seen at intervals in a cloud
of dust, were two, three, five, six others.
This, then, was S. Behrman, with the
United States Marshal and his posse. The

Osterman cocked his revolver and in the
profound silence that had fallen upon the
scene the click was plainly audible from
end to end of the line.
"Remember our agreement, gentlemen. "
cried Magnus in a waiting voice. "Mr.
Osterman. 1 must ask you to let <*own the

No one answered. In absolute quiet,
standing motionless In their places, the

buggy's wheels.
Steadily the distance between the
leaguers and the posse diminished.

BATTLE BETWEEN THE LEAGUERS AND THE RAILROAD, AS
DESCRIBED BY FRANK NORRIS.
Delaney close at hand addressed an un
heard remark to him. The cow-puncher
replied curtly and the words seemed to
anger Gethlngs. He made a gesture,
pointing back to the ditch, showing the
intrenched Leaguers to the posse. Doiane y
appeared to communicate the news that
the Leaguers were on hand and prepared
to resist to the other members of the
party. They all looked toward the ditch
and plainly saw the ranchers there, standr
ing to their arms. . : ' ;
But meanwhile Ruggles had addressed
himself more directly to Magnus, and be
tween the two an angry discussion was
going forward. Once even Harran heard
hiF father exclaim: â¢Â¦ -
"The statement is a lie and no one
knows it better than yourself." ;
"Here," growled Annixter to Dabney.

The other members of the Marshal's
force had come forward from their place
behind the buggy and were spread out
across the read. Some of them were
gathered about Magnus, Garnett and
Gethings;: and some were talking to
gether, looking and pointing toward tne
ditch. Whether acting upon signal or not,
the Leaguers In the ditch could not tell,
but It was certain that one or, two of the
posse had moved considerably forward.

The first novel. "The Octomis." deals with
the wi>r between the whefltgrover and the rail

In the May Bookman there commences
a fine serial story entitled "Warwick of
the Knobs/' by John Uri Lloyd, author of
"Strlngtown on tne Pike." To thusÂ»e who
have reac 1 Mr. Lloyd's earlier book we
may say that the story deals with practi
cally the same scenes and the same pe
riod. "Warwick of the Knobs" is a study
of a life such as men like Warwick met
both with Warwick's faith and stoicism.
These men were iron In the manner In
which they clung to tradition, to home, to
family pride and. above all, to their re
ligion and their God, whom they believed
to be relentless but just. "This descrip
tion of Boone (Strlngtown) County," says
Mr. Lloyd, "Is such as history might re
cord, but does not." The scenery, the
people, the methods of worship, the preju
dice, the sacrifice, the love, the nobleness
of character, might all have been drawn
from actual. llf? -Â¦ '
There was ho Warwick. At least there
was no one; of that name who presented
the characteristics of the man whose
name has given the title to this story.
But with that, we might say. pure fiction
ends. Beyond it everything lies somewhere
or other in that borderland where the
memory and the imagination meet and
blend. These bills of Boone County felt
often the. tread of Morgan's cavalry. From
this historic section of our country, this
borderland which both in topography and
in events may be likened to the Scottish
Highlands, hundreds of recruits turned to
swell the forces of the great Southern
cavalryman who passed through this
county after Ms escape from Columbus
and for a time was secreted in a house
on one of the knobs of Gunpowder. The
ruins of the old church on the Island, the
first church reared In Northern Kentucky,
built wihle yet Kentucky was a county of
Virginia, a'historic landmark, are still to
be seen.
The story : marks a distinct advance
upon "Strlngtown on the Pike."

To make this" book one and the first of
the trilogy of "The Epic of Wheat," Mr.
Ncrris has- with definite purpose not con
fined himself to one story, but given many
stories. If the. reader follows the numer
ous threads that the opening chapters of
fer he will find that they are but the un-.
raveled ends of the great cable that leads
to the ultimate purpose in the author's
mind. . : Â¦Â¦ Â¦.:-;Â¦Â¦ ;.y
Each and every, one of the 'numerous
characters offers a story in itself,
and yet all of these plots are so closely
related that one is Â¦ dependent upon the
other. There is, first, - Magnus Derrick
(the "Governor") and his sons: Harran,>
the apple of his eye, and Lyman. the city
bred man, who so falsely deceives the
League in its fight against the Railroad.
The life of this family from Its sturdy
beginning down to Its downfall of the fa
vorite son. ruin of the father arid . un-,
worthy rise of Lyman, Is presented in
ever;' detail. â¢ "
Then there is Annixter, the proprietor
of one of the ranches, an odd character,
who fears the .'-'feemale" woir.an^ is hard
end ready to ride â¢ over all for his own
left? , :
Then suddenly Vanamee's wort's came back
to his mind. What was the larger view, what
contributed the greatest good to the greatest
numbers? What was the full round of the
circle whose segment only he beheld? In the
Â«nd, t!.e ultimate, final end of all, what, was
left? Yes; irorxi Issued from this crisis, un
touched,' unassailable, undented.
Menâ motes in the sunshineâ perished, were
shot down In the very noon of life; hearts were
broken; little children started In life lament
ably handicapped ; young girls were brought
to a life of shame; old 'women died in the
heart of life for lack of food. In that little
isolated group of human Insects misery, death
and anguish spun like a wheel of fire.
BUT THE WHEAT REMAINED. Untouched,
unassailable, undefined, that mighty world
force; that nour's'.-icr of nations, wrapped in
Nlrvanic .calm. Indifferent to the human
swarm, gigantic, resistless, moved onward in
Its appointed frrnnvPF. Through the welter of

WHE>T you read Frank Norris*
story "The Octopus" the feeling
Is at first one of doubt.. For two
or three hundred pages you grope
In confusion, trying to mentally assimilate
the many characters and the parts they
are playing, trying to grasp a thread here
and another there. You look at the "map
of the country described" on the first
rage to get your bearings, and then you
turn back and read once more, and won
der as you dive again into an apparent
maze of plots who is to be the hero and
who the heroine, and why there are so
many characters and a great many other
things. All this you do because you have
been narrowed by the literature of the
' day down to the level of the "human in
terest" novel, with its singleness of plot,
its "good" man and Its "good" woman,
and all the rest of them.
If you are one of the confirmed und
hopeless In- the up-to-date romantic school
you take one last look at the map, a fare
well, furtive plancc at the lon^ list of
"Principal Characters in the Novel." which
theatrically occupies a flyleaf, and then
you throw down the book with a sigh. and
wonder what has happaned to your dear
friend Mr. Norris. who wrote "Moran of
the Lady Letty" and "McTcague" and so
many nice short stories.
If you are not one of the "hopeless" you
keep on, and the great purpose of the
work begins gradually to dawn upon your
romance-harrowed Intellect. You realize^
that this Is a Dook of no one plot. It gives
many stories which go to make one story,
and that one story is but a linger post in
the path of reason, to point out something
higher and almost too near the infinite for
the comprehension of the finite mindâ the
tremendous Force that rules the world as
one small part of the universe.
Mr. Xorris has undertaken a colossal
work in this first volume of "The Epic of
the Wheat." And he has succeeded. He
may be accused of crudeness. of youth.
He may be criticized in detail as to style
or treatment. His book may never become
one of "the popular novels." But, never
theless, though he has aimed highâ higher
than any of the American writers of the
present day â he hps hit very near the
mark, and these who read to the end
and cannot understand and appreciate his
masterful exposition of the forces of na
ture in contradistinction to the "small
bustle of mankind and minute swarming
of the human insect" shouldâ well, they
should devote themselves to the reading
of "Love Letters." or something "neat,
tasty and interesting."
In "The Octopus" Mr. Xorris has taken
California as his stage. He puts over
twenty "Principal Characters" on the
boards. These divide themselves naturally
IS THIS
THE MAN TO WRITE
"THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL"?
into two groupsâ the Leaguers and the
.Railroaders, lighting against each other
the war of extermination. He takes as a
historical anchor the Mussel Slough inci
dent, of 1S7S. and one might imagine upon
first thought that the purpose of the work
was an arraignment of the Southern Pa
cific and a vindication of the "hard-bitten
farmer" of the San Joaquln. The partisan
of either side will be disappointed, how r
ever, in this belief, for he will find that
the author has drawn a composite picture
of many facts, of many dates iind of some
fiction. Mr. Xorris' object is to tell of
wrongs and horrors, not with the idea of
eliciting sympathy for .sufferers of the
past, but to show the everlastingness of
the most mighty of world forces â THE
WHEAT. The truth he constantly brings
forward v.'ith hammer-like persistency.
When the Leaguers have found that their
most trusted representative, the son of
the leader of the League, has failed them
and he has been throv.-n out with "blows
and curses, Mr. Norris here avails'him
self of the dramatic situation to* bring
forth by contrast this great Truth." Pres
ley, the poet, the philosopher, the friend
of the farmer. v.ho has just assisted In
kicking this Judas out into the nightâ
Presley, still hot-headed from the fray, to
h!m comes this great Truth as his. blood
cools and alone he contemplates nature.
Ard there before him. mile after mile. Illim
itable, covering ~th<" earth from horizon to
hcrlzon. lay the Wheat. The growth, now
many days old. was already high from the
ground. There it lay, a vast, silent ocean,
shimmering a pall!<l ereen under the moon
and "jnder the etars; a m'ghty force, the
strength of nations, the life of the world
There In the nlsrht. under the dome of the
sky. it was growing steadily. To Presley's
mind the scene in the room he had Just lsft
dwindled to paltrv inFismiflcano^ before this
sight. Ah, yes, the Wheat â it was over this
that the Railroad, the ranchers, the. traitor false
Â¦ to his trust, all the members of an obscure
conspiracy, were wrangling. As if human
agency could effect this colopsal power! What
were these heated, tiny squabbles, this fever
ish, small bustle of mankind, th's minute
swarming of the human insect to the great,
majestic, silent ocean of the Wheat itself?
Indifferent, gigantic, .resistless, it moved In
Its appointed grooves. Men. Ltllputlans. gnats
In the sunshine, buzzed Impudently in their
tiny battles, were born, lived through thÂ«"!r

Wheat wrapped inNirvanlc calm, grew stead
ily under the night, alone with the stars and
with God. 'Â¦;â¢' Â¦Â¦'Â¦â¢â¢â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦ !. '
Again, as a fitting close for the chap
ters of battle, crime and bloodshed, this
Truth appears to Presley as he stands on
an outgoing ship loaded with wheat for
India and the vision, of that terrible im
mediate past is before him:
VÂ»hat thÂ»n was left? Was there no hope, no
outlook for the future, no rift In the black

ONE OF MRS. CRUGER'S BOOKS OUT
IN A NEW EDITION.
THE sentimental wave that has
spread. over the world with enough
violence to give popularity to " An
, Englishwoman's Love Letters" is
responsible for the new edition by D. Ap
pleton & Co."of "His Letters" by ' Jullen
Gordon.- These were copyrighted In 1892 ;
but as everything in the way of ."letters"
now seems to be the vogue, a "new edi
tion" may not be out of place for public
favor. ; -~f\ . .' ~, ; -.,, ;
"His Letters" cannot be compared with
Jullen Gordon's (Mrs. Van Rensselaer
Cruger) book of last year, "Mrs. Clyde;"
but for those' who dote on j reading the
purrlngs of -love from the heart-to-heart
medium of letters it will answer well
enough. : â¢-Â¦:
The writer of these epistles Is supposed
to be a brilliant orator and lawyer of
some forty odd years". There are parts
that no sane man of that discreet age
would be willing to claim authorship of.
although proceedings In, modern courts, of
law and up to' date breach of promise
suitfi have demonstrated they might real
ly have happened,' for "there's f no fool
like an old fool" 'still seems to hold good
even in the present century. ; ' â¢ '
This talented member of the bar finds
Inspiration in a painting and /without
the conventionality of an introduction
to the artist' proceeds to fall in love and
write letters. This explanation takes but
a few pages of the book, the rest of the
volume" being made up of the one hundred
and fifteen letters that the. gentleman
writes 'to the object of his adoration. The
lady is, not personally in evidence except
in such portions of the letters that repeat
parts of what "she has had to say. .
Mrs. Cruger can gain nothing from these
letters in the way of literary fame ex
cept from those who care for sentimental
ity, of the mawkish order. Still in all
fairness to her literary abilityâ which, as
has been demonstrated In her other books,
is of no mean orderâ her power of epi
gram shows forth with undimlnished lus
ter. Here are some good bits from "Hi3
Letters :" * J
Unless one can bear punishment repentance
amounts to nothing.
When love comes death has no terrors.
I have lota of enemies; thank God for that.
' Tragedy is quite out of date now â it's bad
form. In fact.
Even; in a delirium a man. may Innocently
say something which Jars upon the fiber of
an ear infinitely more delicate than Â« ura.
If there were no religion women like you
would make, men Invent one.
Love is but a childâ he takes cold from too
much exposure.
Nothing grows more slowly than trustful
ness.
Only one woman in a million can feel love;
only one in ten* million can evoke it.
A man's love never changes; a woman's
may, because she has more vanity.
Isn't it. too' bad the truth 13 so horrible!
One always Is capable of hurting the- very
thing for whlch^one would die.
Perfect? Ho. Had she been perfect sh<%
would have been less lovable, j
Another's wisdom does us no- good.
How much happier we would be If we could
deceive ourselves.'
To a woman that loves there is no tragedy
like that oZ love unsatisfied.
Man by some relenting mood of heaven,
finds a blossom of Eden In his path and often
treads it under foot. . --
Defeat or triumph depends upon the alms
one starts with.
I used to be fool enough to suppose that
love was all fun. Heavens! there is very lit
tle fun In it.

MERICAXS are the greatest coffee
// \\ drinkers on the face of the globe,
Jf~~^ and every year the consumption of
the beverage is increasing. One
half of the world's production of the ber
ry is brought *o the United States. More
than $1,000,000 a week is sent out of the
country for this article alone, and the
worst of it is that all this money goes to
foreign nations, while American citizens
and the people of recently acquired colo
nies can supply every need. Porto Rico,
Hawaii and the Philippine Islands produce
a superior quality of coffee, commanding
high prices In the markets of the world.
Porto Rican coffee .has long been looked
Â¦upon as high prade and for many years
has commanded high prices in the mar
kets of Europe, and the development of
coffee culture in Hawaii during the past
few years has also been very satisfactory
in the quality of coffee produced and the
prices realized. In the Philippines also
the product is of high grade.
The importations of coffee into the
"United States during the nine months
ending with March, 1901, amounted to 617.
244,000 pounds, with a value of 545,21b,000, a
sum nearly $5,000,000 in excess of the value
of the coffee imports of the same months
of the preceding fiscal year. Indicating
that for the full fiscal year the total value
of the coffee imported into the United
ArT^r-'CanS DÂ«ik Oceans of &0HJM2-
States will be about $60,009,000. Even this
is somewhat below the annual average
cost of coffee imported during the decade
just ended, the reduction in U>tal value be
ing due to the fall: of about one-haif in
the Import price. :

in the languages. In many of the smaller
places there are schools, 'sometimes un
der the village "Pope" or priest, who
celebrates mass in the little Greek church,
in the center of the villagfle. To this
church the children are taken every Sun
day, and often on saints' day as well, and
there they learn to cross themselves and
to bow when their elders do. just at homo
they bow before the "ikon" in the cor
ner. An "ikon" is a. small metal picture
of some saint or other holy personage,
and no peasant's hou3e is too mean to be
without one. That and the steaming brass
samovar, at which the family quaff hot
tea. and the great Russian stove, near
which they love to curl in the cold win
ter, are the three great Institutions in
the life of the small Siberian peasant.
At an early age the boys learn to help
their" father with his horses and cattle,
and to assist him in the field in the spring.
Here also his mother and sisters come to
work, and the girls put . "forth their
strength as lustily as the boys. It would
seem strange to them to have their chlld-
Ford happy and free from care. Though
their parents are almost always kind,
they are expected to bear .their part of
the daily burdens : almost before their
little shoulders are able. They, always
dress just like their elders, too. The girls
Â¦wear a bright cotton 'kerchief tied over
their yellow hair, and a print dress in
summer, and are mostly barefoot, In
winter they are carefully muffled, like the
boys, in long sheepskin coats. Their
brothers wear miniature pairs of Ion?
wrinkled boots that always form part of
the father's costume, and baggy trousers.
"TpHERE are many thousands of Rus
sian children livine with their par
|l rnts in the little villacres which dot
the vast steppe of Siberia, or line
the banks of the great; rivers at Intervals
of twenty qr .thirty "versts" (a verst ; is
two-th,irds cf a mile). : Many of .them are
the children of emigrants who have but
lately settled there. ?ind can remembT
some of the Russian homes that tV.ey have
left far behind; many:, mere were born
on the steppe and know of nothing dif

' Thi - life of these children would seem
very dreary to u?. but they are quite hap
py and 'contented. Many of them die at
an early age because cf the rigorous cli

little girls get as much; fun from a piece
of cloth wrapped up to look like a baby

centers, such as Irkutsk, the capital, or
.Khabaroffsk, the seat of Government of
Eastern Siberia, or in the city of Vladi
vostok; on the Pacific coast, have good
opportunities for schooling, and the boys
can attend a military gymnasium, or
school, which. Is under the Government,
and where much' of the instruction is
given by army 'officers. In these schools
a boy has a chance to get a thorough edu
cation, which even gives him instruction

walked into tho ofllce of h|s friend, who
is cashier . in one of the large business
houses of Kansas City. ' . Â¦
"It's al*Bj : Â« the. unt-xjiected" that hap-:

I'm sorry to say? it has been broken'epen

He was very sorry. Indeed. He took his
frit hd with him- to the express olllce.
There- wa? the box, ark; It was broken
open. Hoon was so angry; so was Ilan
numâsorry and disappointed. .
The more 'Hoon thought about the way
,met a'ffiend, and having met a friend it
was quite' in che nature of things that
Mr. Hoon' should continue" his journev in
a Pullman rather than in a long box. Vir
tue was reaping a well merited reward.
Back in Kansas % City Mr. Har.num was
pressing his 'cltiirn . and demanding ?23
with great zeal and persistency. He had
been bitterly disappointed 'and he wanted
to get something out of it In order to
make good.- Ho camped on the trail of
Wells-Fargo and worried them until, they
had bad dreams of long boxes and spook
Jrobhers; but they would not pungle up $23.
Then from .Us home at Bell Center,
Ohio, L.: F.Huon wrote his old school
mate. JdlinW. Hannum, telling him that
it was ail a Jokeâ that he was the original
par kagef-the most original package per
haps of the .r.any thousand that have
been shipped into the vic}nUy of Kansas
slree the State became- "dry." Mr. Hoon
thought it was a good joke, and he could
imagine how Wells-Fargo would laugh
over It. ,
But WeHs-Fargo didp't laugh. Wells-
Fargo pf ted the matter to the bottom
even after John W." Hannum had dropped
the thing like a hot biscuit and was busy
trying to forget about it. Wejls-Fargo
persisted until Mr. Hannum lost his appe
tite and began looking up authorities on
the easiest and surest way of committing
suicide. Mr. .. Hannum 4had such a ppor
sense of humor. Really, Mr. Hoon's little
joke was totally wasted on his dear friend
Hunnum. , * .
One day a committee from Wella-Fargo
waited upen Mr. Hannum in state. After
presenting Mr. Hannum with the profound
â p.iid "went broke." -
Now. Denver "fi probably as comfortable
a place as any in which to "go broke,"
but as for the matter of that, all places
look alike to the poor chap who goes
tramping up and down the streets with
the horrible consciousness that an aching
void occupies the place in his trousers
pocket which once held the reassuring
wc'pht of a plethoric '. Â» ckskin that pulled
down hard with a good old suggestion of
opulence.
L. F. Hoon realized that he was "up
asainst it." Denver is not California:
neither does the cold wind of the Rocky
Mountains temper itself to the shivering
fHjjourner to any great extent. Â¦â¢ It has
other business to attend to. Hoon became
very cold. Then he was both hungry and
cold. Finally he became desperate, and
Â¦when a man becomes hungry, cold and
'desperateâ something is bound to trans
pire. - - .-V Â¦-: -Â¦ - ; 'Â¦ . ':-â¢.â¢ â¢ Â¦
'Â¦'". It happened that one night he dropped
into a lecture room where a hypnotist was
holding forth. Hoon was not filled with a
desire to hear a lecture, but the room held
e suggestion of light and - warmth and
such things looked good to Hoon, for out
side the thermometer was grubbing
around down in the bottom of the glass
and the oldest inhabitant was *,eing kept
busy relating the fact that nothing like
it had been known since the cold snap of
umpty-one. Hoon accepted the words of
the oldest inhabitant as gospel truth. He
was ready to swear to the statement and
let ifRo at that.
Up on the lecture platform the hyp
notist was engaged in putting people t6
s'tep. He aiso paid them money far al
lowing him to do so.
"This Is right in my line." Oought
Hoon. To be' put to sleep was jsood
enough, for he had had no sjeep for
some time, but to be paid for it was some
thing almost too good to be true. He ap
plied for a job and was accepted.
Hoon proved a good subject. Only a
few passes and he lell asleep dreaming
of fried chicken and the old fireplace
back in the Ohio homestead.
This was the beginning of an engage
ment lasting for several days. Hoon was
the star attraction of the professor's
show. He would bo put into a trance
and hauled about ov^r town and exhibited
like a choice bit of statuary. In the even-
Ing he would go to sleep again and allow
the professor to break stones with a
sledgehammer upon his rigid breast.
The position kept him from starving to
death and his professional s'.epps saved
him the worry cf hunting for a, bed; but
at last he grew homesick and began cash
ing about for a way to get back to Ohio.
Walking was out of the question. Th.y
brakebeam was impracticableâ there waÂ«j
too much snow upon the track and a gen
tlenmn would certainly be frozen to 'death;
Â¦ before traveling a .mile, Obviously there
must be brought lntJ play something orig
inal if .Mr. Hoon expected to win back to
Ohio with his toes and .fingers all Intact
and his nose in running order. :. : - :
By thjs time Mr. Hoon and the hyp
notist had become very chummy; so one
day the unhappy wanderer from the
Buckeye State opened up his heart and
confessed to the wiM desire to go home
that was eating him like a canker. ?:'::'Â¦',
Now the professor was sorryto lose his
best subject; but he deeply sympathized;
and so he joined Hoon in arranging this
ingenious plan for boating the transporta
tion game. . . . Â¦". ; '
One day Mr. Hoon wrote ! to an oil
schoolmate, John W. Hannum of Kansa3
City, telling him that he (Hoon) was
about to send his old friend an express
package. He then procured a long box
and lay down in it, his friend the profe~
eor tucking him. up comfortably and put
ting him to sleep. V : V '.. 'Â¦*
"You are now sound asleep!" said the
hypnotist. Hoon made no denial of the
statement. ? ' :
"You will wake up immediately upon
your arrival in Kanaas City!" suggested
the professor, "and will feel do incon
venience from your trip." Hoon was like
a piece of marble. His eyes were closed.
Ins breathing Imperceptible. The closest
examination would have failed to detect
more than the very faintest signs of life.
The hypnotist satisfied himself that his
subject was thoroughly, hypnotized. Then
he placed the lid upon the box and fas
tened it; down, not so securely, however,
but that it might have been broken open
from, the inside. -This done, he tacked
upon the box the address written a few
moments before by .; the unconscious man
inside. An expressman was called, Ihe
box lifted in and delivered at the station,
decorated with mysterious WellB-Fargo
hieroglyphics, and. started down the line
toward Kansas City.
Beneath the train the snow was whirl
ing and freezing upon the brakebeams.
Within . the car L. F. Hoon was still
assurance of their distinguished consider
ation they imparted the grave information
that not only had the box been broken
cpen from the inside, but it had been
broken open by the packageâ said pack
age being the body of the* sender of the
package, Mr. L.. F. Hoon. Not only had
Mr. Hoon broken open the package,, but
he had feloniously and with malice afore
thought removed, abstracted
and stolen the package â said package be
ing his , own -, bodyâ and had taken said
package away without paying upon it the
amount necessary to repay the said
Wells-Fargo for hauling it safely all the
way from storm-kissed Denver to the city
of pork-packing!
Mr. Hannum knew it before and this
cecond enlightenment changed him from
a meek and trustful soul into a vindictive
man with a thirst for blood. He bade the
committee take its claim to u. more salu
brious clime and there present it to the
one who had instigated this wretched plot
that had ruined his peace of "mind and
placed silver threads upon his brow.
And that is the way the matter stands.
Mr. Hoon is safe at home in Bel Center,
Ohio," with his feet upon the mantel. and
the short ribs of the fat,ted calf simmering
upon the stove in the kitchen up in Den-
ver. The professor has burled his grief
deep down in his heart and; trie* to ap
pear cheerful with another subject. Down
in Kansas City John W. Hannum has an
attack of snakes at sight of an express
wagon and won't accept a present under
any circumstances.
But the Wells-Fargo Express Company
is the worst "balled-up" of the whole lot.
When a package ships itself over the
line to Kansas City, then breaks open its
case and steals itself, can said package bo
arrested? If so, on what grounds? Hasn't
the package a right to itself? "If not,"
says , Wells-Fargo, "you'll have to show
me!" 'I*'-;'. ;
But that's the way L. F. Hoon got homo
from Denver without paying any one. Tha
rest of the characters are merely accesso
ries, and the plot that has wound itself
about John W. Hannum and the "Wells-
Fargo Company is the gentle flavor, of ro
mance, as it were, that causes L. F.'Hoon
to smile dreamily as he looks back over
the past, smoking "long green" before tb.a
fireplace at Bel Center, Ohio.
But if ever you decide to travel by ex
press â don't go by way of Kansas City.
The air is still blue all around there and

completely that it wears the blush
of conscious inferiority. ,'.--'- Â¦ '
Some time aero L.. F. Hoon left his home
in Pel! Center, Ohio, and started out West
to see a little cf life. He reached Denver
dreaming of the old homestead and the
pile of Jack'-oak logs roaring redly in the
fireplace chimney. Wells-Fargo was In
nocently expecting to be paid for trans
porting the lour box for so many snoWy
mileB down through the canyons and over
the bleak plains to Kansas City. , Away
down at the end of the line poor deluded
', John W. Hannum was awaiting his ex
pected present with almost childish antic
ipation. Back ihÂ»frost-bitten Denver the
professor was idly ' wonderinsr how it
would . al Iturn \ qut as 'he went "about

Arrived In -Kansas ."; City, 'the long box

"Where am I?" he thought. Then he

THE MAN WHO SHIPPED
HIMSELF BY EXPRESS.DR. W, J,- HOFFMAN,', of the Geo
logical Survey, has been making a
Study of poisoned arrows. ; Among
other things he says: V
â¢ ''The Ainoa of Japan prepare a poison
tor. spreading, upon bamboo or . metal' ar
row points to kill game with, a small por
tion of flesh about- the; wound oelng cut
out before the ~ animal , is . -'cooked - and
eaten, In Java, Borneo,' New Guinea and
other islands the practice Â¦ obtains to a
considerable extent. ;
\ . ''The" poisoning of arrows prevails Â¦ ex
tensively - In Africa, .particularly on the
west -, ooast, In â¢ the Â¦ Gaboon, "among the
Bomalis and with the Bushman. By the
Bushmen : the "juice of a' plant Is * used,
mixed with thfc pulp JetS. a '.. venomous
worm, V ' ' \ , .-Â¦; v.^- i . â¢'
. "The best known and' most active of ar
row poisoning is the woora'm or uralrl of
South America, It is chiefly used for the
tips of ; darts blown from the blow gun,
and the most Important * ingredient Is thÂ«
juice of the plant from which strych
nine Is obtained, to which are added cer
tain other vegetable '. elements ' and y ser
pent venom, i In Central America poisons
are also, employed, on arrows and blow
gun darts. The Caribs employed similarly
a poison- made*- from' the sap of a tree
called the mancen illes. The antidote wus
the application to the . wound of. what , we
call arrow root. ..
' "The Seris of : Northwestern Mexico pre
pared a poison by putting in to. the ground
a cow's liver, rattlesnakes, scorpions,' cen
tipedes and' other. unpleasant things, and
beating them with a stick. .Into the mix
ture the i arrow points were; dipped, and It
would be difficult to Imagine a much more
poisonous : concoction or compound. ; The
Apaches and neighboring; tribes were until
recently In the habit of smearing upon
their arrows a â¢ composition said to be
composed of a decomposed deer's liver
and rattlesnake venom. In some instan
ces crushed red ants are also reported to
have ..been "used. Â¦ -- Â¦â'< . : T-*t' r
"A microscopic examination of such a
coating upon, arrows- obtained V from
Apaches years â¢ ago showed the presence
of blood Â¦ and a crytalllne substance that
was apparently rattlesnake venom. It is
a well established fact that the venom of
serpents ..retains its- poisonous properties
when dried indefinitely. >Y
"The Shoshone and Bannock indlans
state that the proper .way to poison ar
rows, as formerly, practiced by.- them, is
to secure a deer and cause it to be bitten
by a rattlesnake, Immediately after which
the deer Is killed, aad UuÂ» meat removed
and placed In a hole in the ground. When
the â¢ mass has become putrid the -arrow
points are dipped Into It. The Clallams of
Puget Sound used to make arrow points of
copper, which were afterwards drpped in
sea water and permitted to corrode. This
was a dead-sure death <lealer.
"I have^never met an Indian who would
admit the use of poisoned arrows in wat
fare against man. They will say they uae
poisoned arrows to kill game, but not to
shoot In warfare. In nearly all instances
when poisons are prepared* by Indians the
operation is performed with more cr less
ceremony, chanting 'and incantation, for
the purpose- of, evoking evil spirits or da
mons. In their belief the effects of poisons
are due wholly to the presence in them of
malevolent spirits or demons, which enter
the body of the victims and destroy UfÂ«,'Â«

THE ; SUND&Y CALL.
IN THE FRATERNITYTHE> SUNDAY' CALL.
HEXT: WEEK.
In the Fraternity Houses
'-. 1 at Stanford. ;
THE PIRATICAL FLEA AS THE SAMS0N OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
t-j-iHE flea possesses all the piratical In
stinctsâthirst ftMV blood, rapacity,
Jl cruelty. He Is further as ingenious
in devising tortures as he Is untiring
in the torment of his victims.
The flea is built upon lines that make
him ferever hungry. But his continuous
performance appetite is far from " being
the oddest thing about him. Proportion
ately to size, he is the Samson of the uni
verse. If an elephant had the Bame rela
tive strength he could come near to over
setting a steel-framed sky scraper.
A flea, wingless, -with a body out of all
proportion to his head, and all over less
than the sixteenth of an inch in length,
will leap upon a planÂ© surface more than
a yard. This, too, : when he has been,
batched in hair, or straw, or sand, and
never known what it was to have a full
meal. More marvelous still, he will gyring
perpendicularly upward from one to two
feet. Fancy a man or: boy standing flat
footed and all of a sudden leaping over a
church spire. .(;.;.; ..:
Wonderful things have been done with
fleas. They have been put into gold col
lars and set to drag about lengths of gold
chain at least 100 times their own weight.
Further, an ingenious goldsmith back In
the leisurely seventeenth century made a
coach and four in ivory and gold, with a
coachman upon the box, postillion and out
riders, yet all so tidy It was dragged by a
pair of fleas, workink in gold collars. They
worked under a bell glass, and were ex
hibited In London and Paris. . -v' :
To light like cats and dogs. Is the syn
onym of continuing strife, but even cats
and dogs do not fight so bitterly as cat
fleas and dog fleas. Oddly enough,; the
cat fleas are bigger than the dog fleas,' so
should be always victors. But* here as
elsewhere condition tells. If the cat fleas
are I.izy and luxuriousâ fat they can never
growâ the small, : lean, -keen-beaked dog
lleas kill them out.
Â¦ The' combatants stand up to : fight quite,
like al pair of prize-ring ornaments. As
they have six legs they have plenty to
stand on and still spare 'a couple with
which to belabor each other. Upon Â¦.neu
tral ground, as "a floor or walk,- thu cat
and dog fleas keep the peace. But let one
invade litter or a coat sacred to the other,
and there" is straightway a' fight to a fin
ish. Something even more curious than
this inborn antipathy is that dog fleas will
not live upon a cat nor cat fleas > upon a
dog. ' - \ "V Â¦ , 'Â¦ ' Â¦ ' Â¦; .

When it comes to howling swell look
ing houses, the Delta Kappa Epsllon hold
their heads up the highest. Their house,
painted in bright red and white.' Is a land
mark in thr.t part of town. People say,
"Oh, It's just one block from the 'Deke'
house," or "It's just around the corner
from the 'Delce' house."
Brass : candlesticks, brass vases, brass
trays and even brass baskets,' are every
wnere. The swell window has a window
seat all about it, and there are all sorts
and conditions of pillows there. But the
cutest room in all Berkeley opens off the
hall. It is just large enough for two and
a telephone. Absolutely no more. Even

opened wide there is plenty of room to
entertain all the friends of the fraternity
and not be crowded in the slightest.-
The bedrooms are all differently fitted
up: the studious fellow naturally has
things as different from the gay chap aÂ»
night from morning. But each and everj*
one of them is interesting. . .
The- Kappa Alpha fellows have ane\T'
shir.gled home. The first things that onf
sees on entering is "For matron, press th<
button." Of course, they would never ge<
over laughing If some greenhorn really
tried to. Over the windows in the parloi
hangs "Christian home -for unemployed
girls." Thrn, the "Anti-saloon League",
has Its sign and the "Pastor's study"
and "Modes," and heaven knows what
Â¦ not.
. Their house reminds one forcibly of col
lege life and makes one want 'to shout,
"Rah, rah, rah, California, U. C. Berke
ley, zip, boom, ah!" ' ;
Another pretty sorority house belongs
to the Kappa Alpha Theta^ girls. It is
email but so awfully comfy looking. The
furnishings are on the artistic antique
order. The portieres are made of silk
No one would ever think that it was a
"frat" house to look at it. However, tho
neighbors on one side send over written
messages, "Please do not make so much
noise," while those on the other side de
clare "The girls are just the quietest
things that ever were."
Their floors are al^hardwood, and rugs
are scattered here and there. A tea table
stands before a cosy corner, but perhaps
It. is called a tea table by courtesy only.
The furniture is all light weight, and
any one would know immediately,: If not
sooner, that the buyer had her eye on
the artistic.
â¢ Pictures of noted men and remem
brances of them confront one on all s=irles.
Another thing that the Phi Gamma Delta
boys differ from their brethren in is the
flower Question. Great vases of La
France roses stand in every available
place. The flowers are enough to attract
attention, but having really, truly vases
and not steins shows that they must be
very popular with the sororities.
And. by the way. one of the prettiest
and most homelike of the girls' fraterni
ties is the Gamma Phi Betas' home.
Theii, they 'possess a piece of the first
flag that was captured at Manila. They
Insist that it is no fake, as Frank Norris
was fortunate enough to get it v.iien he
was down there as a special correspond
ent and &ent It to his brother. If It
hasn't been through the war, its looks
certainly belie It.
Over the door just to the right of the
mantel hangs an oil painting of Collis P.
Huntington, and what Is mere, the card
which is attached to It reads, "Presented
to his friends by collis P. Huntington."
His writing alone would make most peo
ple swell up until they couldn't see
straight, but although the boys are proud
of it, they don't tell everybody about the
time that Collts dined with them and left
his portrait behind to convince them that
it had been no pipe-dream.
it is quickly put into execution before it
is lost, f-v : ' :
A home that points with pride to Its
relics is the Phi Gamma Delta.
Their house isn't so large, but it is very
prettily arranged. The hall, parlors and
<llnlng-room all open into each other and
the chimney place acts as a pole the
center. When they dance everybody goes
round and round and woe be to the fel
low who tries to circle the wrong way.
Japanese lanterns and smllax are usually
up, for just as soon as one little affair is
over somebody -has a happy thought and
place to dig for the exams, or while away
a. summer hour. "
The Delta. Tau Deltas are a regular or
chestra in themselves. In other words,
they're very musical. Whether one must
be a. musician in order to be eligible or
not I don't know, but this much I do
know-that if he isn't his nose will be out
of Joint. ; " :
Their parlors are \ not very large, but
they are brimful of banjos, mandolins,
base viols, violins, megaphones, grama
phones and every other kind of phones
that are on .the market. The piano Is
open and ready for work, and a gToaning
music rack stands near to help the good
cause along.
In one corner stands a glass tank filled
Â¦with any number of gold fish. Around
them is a miniature fernery and the ferns
all look as if they had plenty of water,
too. There are several palms about, and
the lion of Lucerne guards the table to
6ee that none of the periodicals are car
ried off to enlighten other "frats."
Their house is very nicely furnished all
the way through; everything reminds one
of that homely saying. "Neat but not
saudy." But It isn't the house that one
thinks about while there â it's the boys,
for nearly every one of them is thorough
ly at home in the art of entertaining.
And epeaking of entertaining brings the
Sigma N*' boys into full blast. They are
never eo happy as when the house is full
to overflowing and when no one can hear
a word that anybody else is saying on ac
count of the general jollification. Go there
to luncheon and nine times out of ten
every man jack will stay at home to see
that the other fellows don't neglect the
guests. ; ..

symboMIes, it is. to-be presumed, "in the
application of it." The formalizing of the
chief- figure is well done and the free
modeling of the supporting figures excel
lent. The man can be seen from two
sides, which is a convenience, and can be
seen with a difference. ' In its suggestion

his face -withal as to find food for pro
found speculation in either. Still, this

In this connection It may be *ald that

backward state. The marble Albright gal

hence a new temporary building had to be
erected. Director W. A. Coffin Is confident
of a fine representation of American art
ists, but it will not be visible oefore June.
Still, no one need hold back on that ac
count from visiting the. fair. In Its out

In addition to this, purely American
work there will be reproductions' of many
classic and renaissance sculptures In ths
inter-columnar spaces of the Propylota
back of the Electric Tower. While in Eu

copies of a great number of pieces of sev
enteenth and eighteenth century work
from the famous garden and parks of
Versailles. Â¦ Â¦ . V-t

its wonderful lighting up of the face of

Symbolism- goes very far with Frank I*
Elwell. This pupil of Falguiere fights on
the ground of his master with great vigor
and skill. His Fountain of Kronos, with
Its strange, striking central figure,, will
furnish conundrums to thousands. Father
Time for him is not an. old man and a
scythe. No,- indeed! Time is a strorig
llmbed. heavy-loinedl'man, with .great
wings, because he flies; with an equal
weight in either hand, because he is in
different to all; with veiled faoe, because
no . one knows his secrets. -. He stands
upon. the tortoise, because his advance is
Bteady, however seemingly . slow. "For
tunately, his Fountain of Ceres needs not

fecundity, and this , is seen in the utter

figure, -vwlth her symbols of .'. life and

With Philip, Martlny come grace and life
in varied expression. He has much work
scattered through the exposition, all of It
admirable, but I would select for especial
note his gracious female figure of "Abun
dance," surmounting the fountain of that
name, of which Mr. Carrere designed the
architectural adjuncts. Swaying as in a
dance of delight, with a long chaplet of
flowers curving behind her back and be
tween her extended arms, her head turned
to the left, her drapery (under whlch^ the
svelte figure is felt) Wowing to the right;
she stands on the roundness of the world,
and a laughing, singing circle of chubby
youngsters are dancing and tumbling
around the base. It is a joyous thing.

while ori one who hrxs risen up in protest
a female fury standing beside the despot
is laying on the lash.' To the rear of the
car two women captivesâ Truth and Jus
ticeâare chained. As a composition it is
finely balanced and the symbolism en
forced in every detail. Viewed from any
point it Is satisfying and tells its story.
The firm seated despot, looking far off to
newconquests, indifferent to human suf
fering; the sense that in his slaves you
see the young and the old alike his ser
vitors, with every atom of their strength,
every cord of tho'.r sinews; the awfui
visor of the bat whiged woman with the
lash; the hopelessness of revolt: the
cheapness of. life; tUe cost of it all in hu
man sorrowâ these all are palpable and
vibrant before you. It will be one of th^
lions of the exposition. Mr. Konti's other
groups at the Temi.ie of Musicâ namely,
"Gay Music," "Religious Music," "Heroic
TVIuslc" and "Apollo. God of Music"â are
also notable' compositions In every way,
and . only dwarfed by M.r. Konti's own
work in the despotic group."
Looking over. the result of the sculptural
work thus broadly outlined, so far as It
can be seen at this writing, there is solid
ground for congratulation. It proves that
we have a body of sculptors of high
imagination, capable of realizing their
dreams in formâ artists . that any nation
might be proud of. The' level of the mon-
The conception throughout. Is a beauti
ful one. When we take these masses of
sculpture in connection with the architec
tural splendorS'Of the fair, the harmoni
ously tinted buildings, the" multiple foun
tains and canals, the gardens and flower
beds, the strfking lift of the Electrlo
Tower, we have a feast for the eye and a
repast for the mind uplifting and ennob
ling. Irrespective of the exhibits within
the spacious halls it will draw millions to
see It and rejoice in It.'
The groups and figures that rise therein
from the water are dedicated to Man. The
central and most important is the Foun
tain of Man; on either side are subsidiary
fountains, -the; Fountain of Hercules the
Btrong and the Fountain of' Prometheus
the aspiring. AroundMhls basin are six
important groups symbolizing man in his
various stages, of development from sav
age to civilized. Turning to the Itef t there
is a similar arrangement of fountains in
a great cruciform basin. Here the central
work Is the Fountain of Nature; on either
side are the Fountain of Kronos, symbol
izing Time, and of Ceres, typifying the
germinating forces of the earth. The six
groups typify mineral wealth, animal
wealth and floral wealth. Now looking
down the central avenue once more, we'
face the Court of Fountains, the FounV
tain' of Abundance facing us.' Â¦Â¦Â¦* IriKthe:
Court of Grand Basin, beyond and in
front of the Electric Tower, Is the great
grouping symbolizing the Genius of Man,
with: subordinate . groups of the Human
Emotions and the Human Intellect, with
the Birth of Venus on one side and the
Birth of Athene on the other. We are
now facing the Electric Tower, and from
350 feet In the air the golden statue of the
Goddess of Liberty looks down on us.
Here are the two pylons typifying tha
- Great Waters In the time of the Indians
and the time of the white man. Around
the colonnade of the tower we see sym
bolic figures of the Great Lakes them
selves. Four, rivers are shown in the
spandrels with pylons of the Genius of

lowed the symbolic idea enshrTnW?!! TTf5
platting of the exposition buildings them
selves. It naturally, therefore, divided it
self Into four main partsâ first, the sculp
tural decoration of the Triumphal Cause
way at the south to signify the power
of the United States am. its glories in
peace; next, the allegorical illustration of
Man and his works along the eastern side
of the great central avenue; of Nature
and her forces on the western side, andÂ»
last, the local and specific symbolism of
'the great inland waters, of light born of
the waters, all centering about the Elec
tric Tower at the northern end. These
four main ideas had each, their sub-divi
sions, â¢which need not be tediously retold.
Suffice It to say here (the visitor to the
exposition will have ample chance to fill
out the sketch for himself) that the tow
ers of the Causeway, are topped by great
equestrian figures, and that groups at the
base of the towers and figures in their
niches carry out the idea 'of national pride
and patriotic quality. Advancing north
ward from the Causeway, we find our
selves on the Esplanade, which here
crosses the central avenue. On the right
hand side is a great cruciform basin with
many fountains.
â¢ ;It is, however,- -the. work of Isadore
Konti that will probably attract the keen
est attention among art lovers and the
publib generallyâ the public which . so
often goes astray in its groping after
what, Ib* worthy. But there is no.mistak
ing the merit and "skill in. Mr. Konti's
group, /'The DespoUc Age." The despot,
the tyrantâ a grim, powerful figure of Ro
man type.- with back blown toga clasped
.Karl Bitter limited his own work to the
four heroic equestrian "Standard Bear
ers" on top of the hundred foot, high
square v pillars ' Of the Triumphal Cause
way. These can-only, be fully'and finally
considered-when mounted in their exalted
places, but they cannot fail to be tremen-,
dously effective. They, are the flag-car
riers of Power and Peace, and, although
the pose of the man with held up banner
on tÂ£*> high rearing horse is substantially
repeated in all, there is a differentiation in
each as striking as the repetition Is. bold.'
The. sense of might, of uplift is splendid
and inspiring, whether it be the naked
Greek helmeted warrior or the naked Lord
of Music with J chaplet of bays and an
tique lyre.' All' the artist's tense strenu- ;
ousness is here in a clear note In alt; The
musculation and articulation . are fine.
Horses and men, they are magnificent If
Mr.' Bitter's work has one fault, it is that
the point of rest Is often wanting. -Here
the. subject does not insist on- it, but Is
found -in the firmness. of the seat of the
riders. His standard bearers might leap
off the four' towers at j any moment, . you

Mr. Bitter's Own Work.
IierVert Adams 'with his golden,.colossal
figure, "The GodOess of I^ight," sur
mornting the : Electric Tower, has
p.ehieveu much. It Is light, airy, graceful,
and well modeled and conveys its idea
fully, with outspread wings and uplifted
torch, but the poise of such figures has,
once for all, been &et in the antique Mer
cury "new lighted on a heaven kissing
hjll," emphasized so lately by the Diana
of the Madison Square tower that the
room for'originallty Is much It
will be admired, however, as it deserves
to be. Considering that it will be; the
central point of the exposition by day
and by night, this is much to be thankful
for. Other work here by this sculptor
does not rank as well. His "Age of En
lightenment" is smooth and balanced, but
trite and academic. He seems to achieve
best where the decorative is the essential
of his work. ;
Timentfil sculpture at tne Tan-Am^rtcar
Exposition is a high one. Free rein has
been given to Individuality. A-. subjeel
was given by Director Karl Bitter to a
sculptor. It was to be a single figure or a
group, occupying such or .such a site; the
figure or figures, were to be. on such .a
scale as to heijjht; that : was' practically
all. .It was. not to be. expected that In
every case a inasterpiece would result,
but the number* of exceedingly striking
and meritorious pieces is something to
wonder at. Few actual failures have been
made, and these, it is-irnderstopd, will not
be exhibited. -Despite the carte blanche
of the order, much of the work is within
conventional linesâ a path of safety has
been sought even by very skillful artists,
but trfe special glory of the "great work"
will slrine out all the more by the con
trast. The names of Isadore Kontl, Philip
Martlny, Frank L..Elwell, Charles Grafly,
Charles I,. I,qpez/ Karl Bitter, Charles E.
Niehaus, George; Gray Barnard. Paul W.
Bartlett and John Boyle will easily take
front rank. Without any desire to attempt
a definitive rating one may place in close
order to the foregoing- Herbert Adams,
Edward: C. Potter, George T: Brewster;
John Gelert and: Louis A\ Gudebrod.
To facilitate the work Mr. Bitter cre
ated a large molding plant at his studio
in Hoboken. where the artists sent their
three-foot high models and where the fig
ures, enlarged to the required size, were
remodeled and cast in staff. This served
an economic end as well, for the work
could be done more cheaply as well as
rcore expedltlously on the large scale. Be
fore the first of May 500 figures and over
had been sent to Buffalo. On the exposi
tion grounds another molding plant has
been set up for the architectural detail
work.
Now as to the sculpture scheme. It f ol-
It was early reserved that sculpture
should be largely used. Around the Elec
tric Tower and the Triumphal Causeway
sculpture was relied on to carry into sym
bollo human detail the ideas these struc
tures were calculated to inspire. The
symbolism which has been so markedly
Imprinted on the whole scheme of the
Pan-American Exposition should in fine
have its most direct translation in sculp
ture. On one side the exposition was to
stand for Man. his development and the
things he had made; on the other Bide it
was to stand for Nature and the use by
man of naiural forces. The Electric Tow
er, as embodying the chaining of the wat
ers of Niagara to produce power and
light, would offer great symbolic oppor
tunities. So ; lt was ordered. In John
M. Carrere. chairman of the board of
architects, Karl Bitter found a very sym
pathetic colleague. Together they plan
ned a display of statuary which called
for important work by no less than thirty
five sculptors. In mere number of figures
the output will, it Is said, exceed the Chi
cago exposition. In merit it can already
be said to be much higher.
Symbolism Everywhere.
Think over the hundreds of soldiers' and
Bailors' monuments scattered over the
country by that time â the infantryman
â¢with peaked cap and the army cloak, on
top of a pillar, repeated a hundred tlmssâ
and then compare these monuments with
the art work that is common now, and
you will perceive a great growth not only
In public taste, but in our sculptors. Mr.
Bitter is part of that growth. He is a
young man in sculpture; that is, he is
â¢under 40 and in the full flush of his power.
The Vlnnie-Ream era was before his
time. One may not be quite sure that the
lobbyist sculptor is actually no more, but
the system has received its death blow,
and artists now must h^ve merit to gain
public favor. That is part of Mr. Bitter's
creed. : Â¦ â¢ "
"We remember well how the very moder
ate amount and, modest Quality of the art
â¢work at the Centennial Exposition of
1876 proved an awakening to esthetics
for the plain people of the country, raised
on the Puritan grayness of American life.
Karl Eittfr was chosen !>y the National
Sculpture Society by a unanimous im
pulse whon the exposition management
confided the choice of a director to that
body. He possesses all the qualities need
ed. Penetrated with the new idea of in
dividuality in composition and work, and
a master of technique, it was known be
sides that he is the incarnation of energy.
In exhibitions time counts, and the di
rector Â¦who accomplishes a great deal
must transfuse his own valorous .quality
into others, give basic ideas that will al
low broad scope in the consequent treat
ment and create that enthusiasm which
makes for creat results. He did notable
work at the Chicago fair, and his vigor
ous lead in the construction of the Dewey
arch, including the modeling of the splen
did group, "The Men Behind the Guns,"
Is fresh In the public memory. The stren
uousness which marks his pieces of
sculpture Is nothing more than a render
ing In stone of his nature. The vigor of
the tall, stalwart Bailor In that group of
combat is the vigor of Karl Bitter. He
knows good work and he is broad enough
to appreciate it when it is not of his own
kind. Here would be an opportunity to
give a brave fillip to the national tastes,
for an exposition should be an object les
son In esthetics as well as a tidemark
for the utilitarian of the time.
To say, therefore, that with these men
outside the count the standard of the
sculpture has been raised high above that
hitherto seen at American expositions is
to hazard a good deal, but the proposition
may i>e t=afe]y advanced.
WHEN Mr. Karl Bitter was se
lected as director of sculpture
at the Pan-American Exposi
tion it was conceded that
- something would happen.
Those whom the you' ,?er generation re
gard as "old fogies" -were a bit shocked
and were prepared for anything. TIip
vounger men were enthusiastic, for here
was a brother who did not understand
the lion's share to be the entire animal
one, in fact, who would give the younger
men a chance in the monumental sculpt
ures. Splendid examples of the work of
French, St. Gaudens and Macmonnies will
be seen on exhibition at the fair, but
these very strong men do not appear
among the creators of the work that is
an actual rart of the architectural
scheme.

and as soon as Admiral Klrkland had wel
comed him I made a short speech, recit
ing that we had the champion twelve
oared cutter of the American navy, and
asked on 'the part .of my crew the honor
of naming her after his daughter. Victo
ria Louisa. He was really touched by the
compliment and. taking my hand, granted
my request most graciously. As soon as
I could; I turned to the 1 crew and called
for three cheers for the Victoria Louisa,
and then three cheers and a tiger for the.
Emperor. -I don't think he ever heard
such, cheer3 before. It was a very pretty
episode and gave our dinner a good start.
"As soon as we, sat down the Emperor

from Admiral Evans' vivid account of his
share In the battle of Santiago. Perhaps
this is just as well. The events of tnat
battle are so fresh in public memory that
they are less novel than other parts of the
book. I shall content myself, therefore,
with his story of the surrender of Captain
Eulate, commander of the Vizcaya, who
came alongside of his ship in a small boat:
."That was a sight." says Admiral Ev
ans, "which- 1 shall never forget as long
as I live. In the stern, supported by one
of our naval cadets, sat the captain, cov
ered with blood from three wounds, with
a blood-stained handkerchief about his
bare head. Around him sat or lay a dozen
or more wounded men. In the bottom of
the boat, which was leaking, was a foot
or so of blood stained water and the body
of a' dead Spanish sailor, which rolled,
from side to side as the water swashed

he was received with the honors due his

his feet, unbuckled his sword belt, kissed
the hilt of his* sword and. bowlns: low.
gracefully presented it to me as -a token
of surrender. I never felt so sorry for' a
man in all my life. Of course. I declined
to receive the sword, or. rather, I instant
ly handed it back to Captain Eulate, but
accepted the surrender of his. officers and
men in the name of Admiral Sampson,
our â¢ commander In -chief. My men were
all crowded aft about the deck and super
structure and when I declined the sword
the brave heart3 under the blue shirts
appreciated my feelings and they cheered
until I felt ashamed of myself.
"As I supported the caDtaln toward my

up .to his full height., with hi3 right arm

passed his lips the forward magazine of
his late command, as If arranged for the
purpose, exploded with magnificent effect.
Captain .Eulate. a sensitive, passionate
man. conducted himself in a way to elicit
the admiration of all who saw him. After
he had been attended to by the surgeons
he occupied a part of my cabin and did all
in his power to aid me in making his of-;

Captain Evans relates how surprised he
was when at 5 o'clock the same morning 1
his orderly called him out of a sound sleep
to report that the officer of the deck said
the: Emperor was just then passing thÂ«
chip, steering his own yacht. His only
reply was, "For heaven's sake don't stop
him!" He managed to get one eye open,
and, looking out of an air port In his
cabin, discovered the Emperor, dressed,
in white : flannels.', steering the Meteor,
bound for an ocean race, and looking as
If he had never taken a drink or smoked
a cigar in his life.
..A3. to the impression made upon him by
the German Emperor, Admiral Evans
tells us that he found him one of tha
most magnetic and companionable of men
âwith onÂ© or two exceptions, the moat
magnetic. "He knows more about more
different things than any man I have
ever met. "When I waa In Kiel my band
was playing music composed by him, and
en my cabin table was a book of poems
written by him. Ho "was the head and
front of the finest army In the world and
at the same time giving his personal at
tention to what must some day be reck
oned one of the leading navies.
"When we went aft. where, every onÂ»
could hear him. he said. 'Captain Evans.

better condition." Very nice for all of
us. He left the ship just at 2 a. m.. and

"Of course, if 'they had provoked It I
should have engaged Â¦ their nine '"ships
without hesitation, and the chances would
not have favored my getting the York
town out of their harbor.", â¢ : ..
Evans, â¢ in command â¢ of the 'battleship
New York,' was present at the ceremonies
attendant -upon the opening of the Kiel
canal,- Germany, in June, 1895, and as the
representative of the United States was
selected for special honors -by Emperor
William. : He had an .interesting experi
ence at a reception- given' on board one of
the 1 German hattleships on the -Sunday
after the . arrival- of 'the Yankee ship.
When . he . went ' over the side "he ' found a

Not Afraid of Great Odds.
Statea. and that neither must- be defaced
by his torpedo boats. After this incident
they did not run at us so much, tnough
the newspapers encouraged them to do so.
The following entry from his journal Is
interesting, as showing hjs feelings at thd
tirre: ' . , .,-,'; .
"Saturday Night. February 6.â A mail is
in, and I have nice letters from friends
cummendlng my course at Valparaiso;
very satisfactory, but 1 wish the news
papers would let me alone. ' Why should
they call me "Fighting Bob?' Some of
them say'they must take .my statements
with 'very larse grains of salt.' But gen
erally they seem to commend me. which,
if one must figure In them, is the best
way; but as I see my duty I shall do it,
hoping for. the approval of the Govern
ment. When they send me orders I shall
try to follow Â« hem. -Some of the letters
Eay, 'We are waiting for you to stir up
the war,' and 'he writers will never know
how near I, came to doing it. Looking
back at it now I am glad I did just what
I did and In the way I did it. I would not
changeit if I could. Of course, I could
have" 'stirred up the war,' and it may be
that people would have justified: me, but I
could not justify myself. In the discharge
of my duty I gave the Chileans a fine
chance to fight if they wanted to, and the
odds were 1 enough in their favorâ nine
ships to one. . But- they backed water
every time, and I maintained, a dignified
and resolute position..
Captain Evans went to quarters at once
and gave orders if one of them even
scratched the paint on the Yorktown to
blow the boat out of the water and kill
every man in her, > so that there could be
no question of an accidental collision. â¢ I
then saw the officer in charge of the drills
and told him that he certainly had great
confidence in the steering gear of his tor
pedo boat; that if anything should jam'so
that one of them struck me' I, would', blow
her bottom out. He replied that the water
in the harbor belonged to his Government
and that he proposed to use it for the
purpose of. drilling his boats. I answered
that -I was fully aware of the ownership
he had stated, but that the Yorktown and
the paint on her belonged to the United
Captain Evans took the refugees on
board his own ship and declared they
would be protected there even if this re
sulted in his craft being sent to the bot
tom with - N all on board. The Chileans
showed their animosity in all sorts of pet
ty ways. One of their favorite tricks was
to run their torpedo boats about. the ship,
using her apparently as a target. At last
one of the boats missed his stern by less
than six feet. . . _ ,
His brusque promptness probably pre
vented war between Chile and the United
States. The United States Minister, Pat
rick Egan, had been charged with -a
breach of neutrality by favoring Balma
ceda's party during the revolution then
raging. The Americans were consequent
ly very unpopular. At Valparaiso some
of the populace had assaulted the boats'
crews of the United States ship Balti
more, killing two of them and wounding
many more. The United States had de
manded reparation. The Chilean Govern
ment, on its part, had protested against
the sheltering of political refugees In the
quarters of the American embassy. Thus
matters stood when the Yorktown ar
rived, , and the Baltimore was ordered
home. . . .
It was while in tha hospital that Evans
heard for the first time an accurate ac
count of his company's losses In the fight
at Fort Fisher; Out of the sixty-two men
in that company fifty-four had been either
killed or wounded. -All the officers from
his ship had been wounded. The naval
brigade as a whole had been frightfully
punished, but they had done what was
expected of them â drawn the garrison
away from the point selected by General
Terry for his assault, thereby aiding the
army to get in. '. . : Â¦
Stopped Threatened War With Chile.
Evans was in command of the gunboat
Yorktown in Valparaiso, Chile, in 1S91.
It was not until after: the victory had
been won that Evans wns rescued from
the dead that surrounded him. He was
so badly wounded that the doctors in
charge of the hospital decided on ampu
tating both his legs. Evans, however
drew his revolver and swore that hÂ»
would shoot the first half dozen sawbones
who dared to approach him. Threats were
effectual where supplication had been
vain, and the young hero waa nursed back
to health with both legs Intact. : :'Â¦'
. "I could . see his feet as they projected
over a pile of sand, and from the'r posi
tion knew, that he bad fought his last
fight. Near me was lying the cockswain
of my boat, Campbell by name, who had
a canister ball through his lungs, and was
evidently bleedlne" to death. When he
saw the result of my shot he said, 'Mr.
Evans, let me crawl over and give that

most before I could tell him that the poor

I was some time doing the trick. In the

treating!' and looking back 1 saw our men
Lreaklng from the rear of the columns
and retrea.ting.Xll the officers, in their
anxiety to be the first into the fort, had
advanced to the heads of the columns,
leaving no one to steady the men in be
hind; and it was in this way we were de
feated, by the men breaking from the
rtcr. Two minutes more and we should
have been on the narapet. and thenâno
body can even guess what would have
happened, but surely a dreadful loss of
life. As the men retreated down the beach
they were gathered up and put into the
trenches to oppose Bragg, and there
screed until after the fort was captured.
Of. the eight of us who went InslUe the
stcckade all were shot down: one, the
color bearer of my company, was halfway
up the parapet when he received his
dtath wound. Â¦ . -. . : ,
"As we approached the remains of the
stockade I was aware that one particular
sharpshooter was shooting at me, and
when we were a hundred yards away he
hit me in the left leg, about three inches
below the knee. The force of the blow was
so great that I landed on my face in the
sand. I got a silk handkerchief out of my
pocket and with the kind assistance of
my classmate, Hoban Sands, soon stopped
the blood, and again went to the front as
fast as I could.
"About this time the men were stum
bling over wires, which they cut with
their knivesâ they proved to be wires to
the: torpedoes over which we had charged,
but they failed to explode. My left leg
Efemed asleep, but I was able to use It.
The stockade, or what remained of it, was
very near, and I determined to lead my
comi any by a flank through, a break in it,
and then charge ..over* the angle of the
fort, which now looked very difficult to
climb. I managed to get through the
stockade, with seven others, when my
sharpshooter friend sent a bullet througn
my right knee, and I realized that my
chance of going was settled. I tried to
stand up, but it was no use; my Ieg3
would not hold me, and besides this I was
bletding dreadfully, and I knew that was
a matter which had to be looked to..
Up and at 'Em, Though Wounded.
ic, the who'e mass of men went down like
a row of falling bricks; in a second every
man was flat on his stomach. The officers
called on the men. and they responded in
stantly, starting toward as fast as they
could go. : ."â¢'â¢Â¦'Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦
"At about 200 yards they again went
down, this time under the effect of canis
ter added to the ritte fire. Again we ral
lied them, and once more started to the
front under a perfect hail of lead, with
men dropping japidly in every direction.
We were now so close that we could hear
the voices of the rebels, and what they
said need not be written here. .The'of
ficers were pulling their caps down. over
their eyes, for it was almost impossible
to look at the deadly flashing blue line
of parapet, an-1 we all felt that in a few
minutes more we should get our cutlasses
to work and -nake up for the fearful loss
we had suffered.

for volunteers to lead a forlorn hope in a

one or the first to step to the front. I
phall condense hi? account of the attack
a_ he -witnessed it:
"January 13 proved a beautiful day for
<--i:r work, clear anil warm enough, with
a smooth beach for our landing. At early
davlight the whole fleet opened on the
fort and poured shells in on it at a fearful
rate After a hasty o-nnc-r .-it noon the
Fignal was made at 1 o'clock, 'Land naval
brigade ' In a few minutes we were on*,
cheered' by our shipmates, and pulling for
the shore, where we landed unopposed
and without serious accident, about one
rrile and a half from the northeast angle
of Fort Fisher. On landing we were
quickly formed in three divisions, with the
marine battalion in the lead.
"During the forenoon a force of firemen
had landed under Lieutenant Preston to
dig rifle pits, well to the front, and these
were to be occupied by the marines, who
were to keep down the rebel lire until the
sailors, armed with cuUass and revolver,
reached the parapet. â¢ Â¦
"At S o'clock the order to charge was
given, and we started for our long run of
1200 yards over thÂ« loose eand. The fleet
kept up a hot fire until we approached
within about OÂ«0 y-rds of the fort and
then ceased firing:. The rebels seemed to
Vnderetand our signals, and almost before
the last gun was fired manned the para
pet and opened on us with 2C00 muskets.
The army had not yet assaulted, bo the
whole garrison concentrated its fire on us.
"Under the shower of bullets the ma
rines broke before reaching the rifle pits
that had been dug for them, and did not
appear again as an organization In the as

cfScrs mixed in'-with the column of sail

BOERS' TACTICS
PUZZLE BRITISH
Kitchener's Troops Are
Hurt Worse Than
Their Foes.
Recent Engagements Show
Republicans Are Carrying
Out Bold Plan. -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 1. â Everybody may be
heartily sick of the distressing war in
South Africa, but interest' was revived
this week in a most remarkable manner,
when two days ago the papers came out
Â¦with some three columns of casualties.
Fighting people were aghast. Where
and on what occasion had so many poor
fellows t>een killed and wounded' in ac
tion? Nothing bad been known either
through official reports or newspaper cor
respondents. While it was announced a
long time ago that Lord Kitchener had
determined to keep all movements as se
cret as possible, it was imagined that the
war was dragging wearily along and that
little bad been done. These casualties
have shown that there has been severe
lighting at times and that the captures of
etores and ammunition from the Boers
have not botn made without considerable
loss and determined, dogged resistance on
their part. - .
Part of Well-Laid Plan.
Then came Lord Kitchener's report of
General Dixon's battle with Delarey's
forces, in which, though the Boers were
driven off, the British loss was very much
heavier, evidently, than that of the Boers.
Prom what has transpired in the last
day or two it looks as if these engage
ments have been part of a well denned
plan on the part of the Boers. With
Botha occupying Sir Blndon Blood's at
tention on the east and Kritzinger ex
tremely active In Cape Colony, where he
has made captures useful to his forces,
2>elarey has made this so far successful
attack near Johannesburg" on the anniver
sary of British occupation, killing and
wounding' 174 of thÂ© British ; and getting
away -with comparatively small loss and
not, so far as known, losing any prison
ers or Ktores, bo that if the Boers are offi
cially reported as beaten off, the day can
not be said to have gone to the British.
Questions are being asked. Are the
Boers endeavoring to make their way to
the fertile but difficult regions of Cape
Colony, there to spend the winter? Is De
â¢wet going to lead them thither? Are
these engagements around Johannesburg
Blmply to draw off Kitchener's attention?
If that be so, the war is very far from
being at an end. .
War Office Reticent.
The reticence of the Government re
garding the battle of Vladfontein and
other military events of some importance
which have recently occurred at widely
separated points in South Africa has led
to considerable anxiety. This is in no
way allayed by the curious answer of the
"War Office to-day to a question regarding
the accuracy or otherwise of the Boer
report that the British under Knox were
defeated near Pretoria, losing forty-six
killed, eighty wounded, 600 prisoners and
six guns. The reply which the War Office
vouchsafed, "We have no official in
formation/.' has aroused some misgivings.
The Sun to-day publishes a sensational
story to the effect that General Botha
has arrived at Standerton and is com
municating by telegraph with Mr. Krug
er, through the Netherlands Government,
appealing to Mr. Kruger to sue for peace.
Lord Kitchener is said to have given
Botha permission to adopt this course.
The Sun further hears that 10,000 Zulus
have gone on the warpath, owing to
Boer raids in Zululand.

for treatment.
Redding House Burned.
. REDDING. June 1.â Brush and grass
flres on. the outskirts of Redding to-day
caused the destruction of the house of
George Cochran. Several other dwellings
and the County Hospital were saved only
by hard work. .
All the delegates said practically the
same thing.
George G. Ward said: "When we saw the
Queen we could scarcely believe she was
the Queen, she looked so young and
charming. Both the King and tne Queen
appeared to be in splendid health, and
they certainly were in the best of spirits."
The following is a complete list of those
present: Morris K. Jessup. Lev! P. Mor
ton, Cornelius N. Bliss. J. Pierpont Mor
gan, J. Pierpont Morgan Jr., John. T.
Terry, George Wilson. Isldor Straus. Wlll

burn, John I. Waterbury. George G. Ward,
Levi C. Weir, William H. Parsons, James
McCreery. J. W. Pinchot, , Vernon H.
Brown, George Bowdoin and W. Bayard
Cutting.
President Morris K. Jessup said: "We
were most warmly welcomed and spent
a most pleasant afternoon. One of the
most pleasant features was the unexpect
ed presence of the Queen. Both she and
the King" are extremely affable. I regard
the - occasion as one that will greatly
strengthen the relations between the two
countries."
Most Warmly Welcomed.
When the audience was over the dele
gates partook of a small feast and re
passed the King and Queen, who were
having tea In the garden. The King stood'
up, took off his hat and bowed his fare
well. The delegates then returned to
London. .
After an inspection of the grounds the
delegates were taken to the east terrace,
whore they were received by" the King.
They were surprised to find that the Queen
was aJso present, for her appearance was
quite unexpected. "With the King' and.
Queen were the PÂ«ncess Victoria and the
children of the liuke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York. Each delegate was
formally presented to both the King and
Queen, shaking- their hands.
This ceremony over, the King asked the
American visitors to replace their hats
on their heads, and both he and the Queen
commenced to chat in the most friendly
way with the little group. The King re
membered meeting previously Â¦ William
Butler Duncan and James W. Pinchot,
much to their own astonishment. This
little reminiscence over, the royal party
indulged in small talk regarding the
weather, the King pointing out the beau
ties of Windsor's chestnut trees, and re
ferring to the need the country had for
rain, and so forth. His Majesty regretted
that the state apartments were so upset
as to be Invisible. He apparently avoided
business and politics, beyond reiterating
how glad he was to meet so many well
known men from America.
Delegates Formally Presented.
r ihe King had expressed considerable
curiosity to see what manner of men
these multi-millionaires might be, espe
cially Morgan and Carnegie. As regards
the latter me King was uisappointea, for
Carnegie was unable to be present. From
the King down all the officials concen
trated their attention on Morgan. Their
curiosity was not unmixed with awe. OnÂ©
of tho nigh officers of the household hu
morously confessed that an inspection of
the list of visitors made him tremble' lest
Morgan or one of thÂ© other millionaires
should take a fancy to Windsor and buy
It. Apart from this personal point of view
a correspondent was officially informed
by Lord Pelham-Clinton, the master of
the household, that the King regarded
tho presence in England of such a reprer
sentative body of American business men
as highly significant of the close and
friendly relations existing between the
two countries, and in furtherance of that
feeling he was delighted to welcome them
to his castle and make their acquaintance.

ish and English,' the embassy considered
it advisable to submit the matter by cable

' I WASHINGTON, June 1.â In answer to
his application for instructions Secretary
Hay has directed Embassador Choate at
London to Issue passports to. the, two Fili
pinos who appeared at the embassy yes
terday "as residents of the Philippine Isl
ands, and as such entitled to the protec
tion of the United States." - ' .
The decision unon this point Is of im
portance, as having perhaps some bear
ing upon the status of the people of the
Philippines, Porto Rico and Guam. , A
year ago the decision was reached to re
card the Porto Rlcana as entitled' to. the
piotectlon conveyed by an American pass
pert, but a formal decision of the test
case was \ prevented v through the with
drawal of the application. The Foraker
act determined the right of Porto Rlcans
aa "citizens of Porto Rico", to the pro
tection of the United States Government.
It Is now 'held that the Spooner law con
veys the same privilege to the Inhabitants
of the Philippines. â¢ ~ , , .
'; The United States statutes prohibit -the
issue of a passport to any but American
citizens., But these later acts, the For
aker act and the Spooner act,' impose ob
ligations in their turn, which -may be re

and may enable the Government . to avoid
a decision upon the question of American

: BERLIN, June 1.â The visit of Queen
.Wilhelmlna and : her husband, Prince
Henry of the Netherlands, and the mili
tary; and court festivities; were favored
Â¦with'- exceptionally . fine weather, - though
hot, bringing thousands of foreign guests
to Berlin. Simultaneous with the pres
ence of the- Frencl^ officers many distin
guished strangexs;"including United States
Senator Albert: J. ; Beveridge, lent addi
tional luster and Interest to the different
functions. ; It was remarkable that Gen
eral Bonnal and his suite throughout the
week, wherever, they went, met- with a
courteous reception by the populace, even
by the commonest laborers, when driv
ing through town, parks and other places.
One significant little occurrence was de
scribed by Colonel Gala, who accompanied
General Bonr.a!. The colonel said that
while/driving -past a: group of -asphalt
street- laborers they, all stopped work,
drew up in a military attitude and sa
luted, some of them shouting "Viva la
France, our next ally." â¢
Emperor "William this week was In con
tinuous, good humor, smiling and return
ing the people's hurrahs. For, a. time the
provisions made for his Majesty's safety
were somewhat relaxed, at his special re
quest. - ~ , . .
'.' It -was -noted that Queen Wilhelmina
yesterday was greeted by the Berliners
with special fervor. She was constantly
bowing and smiling. In court circles the
report that Queen Wilhelmina is in a deli
cate state of health finds credence. It was
noted that very little attention was paid
to her husband, who looked gloomy. The
Emperor seldom addressed him, but fre
quently spoke to the Queen. .. jj
Dazzled by Display of Generals.
It is said that during yesterday even-
Ing's performance at the opera, when the
body of the house was crowded with gen
erals in brilliant uniforms, Queen Wilhel
mina said laughingly, "I did not think
that there' were so many generals in the
world." â¢
The Germap press this week devoted '
much space to discussion of the relations
between. the United States and Germany.
Correspondence from the United States
has appeared in the Kreuz Zeitung and
other Influential -papers, describing the
"spread of anti-German sentiment in the
United States," some of the correspond
ents going to the length of asserting that
American papers \ are systematically in
flaming the public mind to war against
Germany. The papers here' unanimously
maintain that all the alleged German
plans for the acquisition â¢, either of coal
ing stations' or â¢ independent colonies in
Central or South America are "sensa
tlonal Inventions."- . -
The Berliner Tageblatt contains, a two
column article in which, partly on -author
ity of a correspondent, partly on state
ments made by a German-Brazilian, and
partly on extracts from the. Brazilian
press telegrams,- the charge is made that
the United States is systematically In
triguing in Brazil against legitimate Ger
man colonial and commercial influences,
poisoning the Brazilians' minds and con
veying- the idea that Germany intends to
go to war and seize Brazil.
Not Against Monroe Doctrine.
The Tageblatt editorially advises the
Foreign Office to more determinedly deny
such charges,- and also prove untrue, the
often-repeated statement that Germany
Intends to disregard . and * destroy the
Monroe doctrine. ---..., ;
Recent cases in which the supreme ju
dicial powers of the imperial court: at

tion. * - -. ; -..' â¢
- The Polish anti-German agitation, espe
cially in Posen and West Prussia, is be

the report of the committee on secret so
cities took up nearly. the entire morning
session of ttie Reformed- Presbyterian
Synod of* America. The resolutions in re
gard to labor unions were subjected to
some argument, especially this one: ;
"We look upon membership. in many of
these <unions, as at present organized and
controlled, " as dangerous, and warn our
members against joining any. union which
has an Immoral obligation to keep invio
late, as long as there remain the rules
and regulations the issue, of which he is
necessarily ignorant of."
Several speakers, including Ex-Moderat
or Foster/denounced labor unions, assert
ing that they did not leave a free field for
labor, held their meetings on Sunday and
that they are pernicious In their influence
and wrong in principle. The sign of a

claiming that they favored the capitalists

to organize for protection. A standing
vote to recommit the resolutions and
have them made stronger was then car
ried by a vote of 71 to 54. The committee,
after a few . minutes'. " consideration,
changed the resolutions to read as fol

That 'we reWfflrm our testimony asainst all

HJ. McCOT, general -secretary
of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association, and Miss
3 Fannie Elizabeth â Crowell
were united in marriage
yesterday at the home of the bride's par
ents, 3320 Seventeenth street. The cere
: mony was performed by Bishop Hamil
ton of the M. E. church, assisted by Rev.
William Rader, pastor of the Third Con
! gfegaiional Church, of which the bride
I is a member.
: It was intended to be a quiet home
wedding, yet .the beautifully decorated
parlors were crowded with relatives and
immediate friends and the officers of the
local and Stat3 organization of the Y. M.
C. A. â¢ -
The presents were /lumerous and cost
ly. - Notably among them were a com
plete set of silverware from the directors
cf the association, a punch bowl and
stand from the Woman's Auxiliary, and
a ceramic cofCee sot from the employes.
Immediately aftery the ceremony the
happy couple left for the. East on the 6
o'clock overland train. Mr. McCoy is a
delegate, to the World's. Jubilee Conven
tion of the association, which is to be
held in Boston, June 11 to 17. Mr. and
Mrs. McCoy will visit the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo and several other
important cities. They expect to be gone
about two months and on their return
they will reside -at 2401 Fulton . street,
Berkeley.
Mr. McCoy has been for twenty years
the general secretary of the San Fran
cisco Young Men's Christian Association.
Prior to coming here, he was for nine
years secretary at Lowell, Mass. He has
had much to do with the framing of the
policy and success of the organization
which he represents. Miss Crowell has
also been connected with the association
work for fifteen years as stenographer,
and at the last meetlng^of . the board of
directors resolutions were passed most
the misunderstanding with the "Washing
ton Government, but generally admits the
possibility of a wrong construction being
put upon the amendment by the explana
tions and interpretations, and that it will
be best for tho convention to' take up
the question Immediately and accept the
amendment as passed by Congress.
La Lucha says that S5 per cent of the
people favor this, but the delegates are
at a loss what to do. Some claim that
the United States Is not acting in good
faith, as it was most improbable that the
Washington authorities did not know
what the convention was doing and what
was the nature of the report to be sub
mitted. They further say that a major
ity of the Committee on Relations told
them thax the amendment as accepted
would be satisfactory to the United States
and that they had the assurances of
General Wood and Secretary Root to
this effect The members of the Com
mittee on Relations will say nothing re
garding this point other than that they,
too, thought it would be satisfactory.
Secret sessions and absence of stenog
raphers make it impossible for even the
delegates themselves to set things aright.
Regarding the controversy which will
arise later as to who is responsible, tha
cr/rjvention will place the responsibility on
the committee, and they. It is said, will
blame General Wood and Secretary Root.
An effort is being made to-day by some of
the conserva-tlves to avoid this crisis .by
asking the convention to adjourn for a
month. In the meanwhile having the mu
nicipalities petition the convention to 'pass
the original amendment. Several munici
palities have already taken that action,
and it is thought that others will fall into
line.
The municipal election passed off quiet
ly. The Nationalists claim the election
of Senor Gener. their candidate for Mayor,
and a majority of the Council.
The city engineer has disapproved of
the bid for the sewerage and paving of
Havana by Onderdonk, MacLellan &
Dady of New Tork on the ground that the
amount specified Is too large.
The mortgage decree went Into effect
to-day Owners of all plantations where
mills were burned were granted an exten
pion of four years in which to pay off
their mortgages, but others must settle
immediately. : : . .' \
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 1 â The re
ports from outside municipalities show a
general victory for the Nationalists, but
in the citv both parties claim to have won.
The Republicans showed.; unexpected
strength, though probably not enough to
elect thtir candidates. The Nationalists
make charges of illegal voting. The
streets are filled with frenzied partisans,
cheering their favorite candidates. Over
100 arrest? were made during the day, but
there was no serious disorder, though one
small riot occurred in front of thÂ« Jail.
The rioters, however, were dispersed by a
charge of twenty of the rural police.
Much bitterness Is expressed because of
the American supervision of the municipal
elections.

CHICAGO. June 1_â The Record-Herald

inFton: "The Supreme Court has another
Furvrijse In store for the country. Unless
it changes Its mind between now and Oc
tober, the date of its next meeting, the
court trill decide the Philippine caae In
favor of the Government. It will be an
other decision by a divided bench and
upon most extraordinary grounds, to wit:
"L That the United States has never de
clared Its Intention to retain the Philip
pine archipelago Indefinitely, and the only
declaration of policy made was In the
other direction, looking toward a mere
temporary occupation, the United States
being a sort of trustee for the people of
the Philippine*, as It was the trustee for
the people of Cuba. '
"2. That In any event at the time the
Â¦duty complained of (on fourteen diamond
rings) was collected the Philippines were
not in the actual possession of the United
States, but that the United States was
T^glng war for such possession, and such
control as the United States had was lim
ited to operations of military authority.
"I am informed that the court has actu
ally decided this Philippine or Pepke case
in favor of the Government on the gTound
Just stated, and that both Justices Brown
and White are with the majority."
WASHINGTON, June 1.â There Is more
doubt to-niffht in the minds of members
of the administration as to their power
to collect duties on goods coming from
the Philippines to the United States with
out direct legislation by Congress author
izing such collection. No definite deter
mination will be reached until Attorney
Oeneral Knox submits his written opin
ion on the decisions of the Supreme Court,
Ivjt whether or not the collection of du
ties at present Is valid, it is doubted
whether any duties can be collected when
rivil government has been Instituted !n
the Philippines. There could then be no
contention that the Philippines had not
Parsed into complete possession of the
Vn'.ted States, which is believed to be the
distinction in the minds of the Supreme
Court Justices between the status of the
''Islands and that of Porto Rico at the
-. '.me when the pending Philippine case
y. rose. The Philippines would then be In
substantially lhe same relation to the
I'nited States as regard? customs duties
;is Porto Rico was at the time the De
I^ima case arose. :
The theory that the President can im
.pose a tariff on goods coming: from tne
Philippines into the United States under
the authority of the Spooner amendment
to the army appropriation bill does not
receive much support, and unless the At
torney General finally determines that
this can be done the administration will
have the alternative of calling an extra
session of Congress and postponing the
establishment of civil government or go-
the Government's Con
tention.

what may later prove to have. been a ter

Is from South and Central American ports
and on May 17,' was anchored In. the road-,
stead off Acajutla. v Near; her were aa
otiored the Pacific Mall Company's steam
ship San Juan and- the Mexican gunboat
Ivy. ',- It . was," blowing hard at., the time
aj:ill a boat â¢ was lowered from the San
Juan and manned while ; a few minutes
later" one was put in the water from the
gunboat.""' ' Â¦ - . '. ' . "-, .'â¢'
As near as Captain Moon of the Palena
could make .out -the boat from the Ivy
was taking 'an, officer ashore; while the
one from the San Juan was taking Colonel
John Stewart, .the Mail Company's agent,
ashore. ~ Colonel Stewart had boarded the
San Juan the night . before Â¦ and . was un
able i to land i before on account of . the
storm...; The gale had v subsided somewhat
during the night' and . the colonel determ
ined to make the attempt to reach shore.
One - of : the ship's " officers and four men
manned the boat and all. went well until
the -San- Juan's boat and the , Ivy's boat
were near the* beach. /Then those on the
Palena saw an. Immense .breaker rolling
in toward the shore. . . It caught the Ivy's
boat "and threw it against the San Juan's
boat and both were polled over and over
and finally disappeared. The San Juan
was on her way to Panama and will not
get back here until the 18th inst., when
the particulars of the ' disaster will be
learned. *.-- .'Â»..Â¦--
Captain Moon signaled the steamer sev
eral times while he remained at Acajutla
but could -not learn anything further.
Captain Robertson promised to telegraph
him at one. of the Mexican ports but the
message must have missed him. Captain
'Moon is very much afraid that not a soul
In either boat was saved.

The steamship Adato is now nine days
out from this port for Guayaquil with an
enormous cargo of lumber and the steam
ship Victoria due to-day from Puget
Sound is to load railroad ties for the same
port.
"In another three years Guayaquil will
be the finest port in South America," said
P Olivan on the steamship Palena yes
terday. "A wharf 1500 feet long is to be
built "in the Guayas River and from it
piers will - radiate. It will be built on a
solid foundation and will be traversed its
entire length by a railroad. It will have
facilities for discharging 1500 tons of
freight in twelve hours- and will be up to
date in every respect. Martin Reinberg &
Co. have the contract and they forfeit
$100,000 a year for every year over three
thev take to finish the job.
"The railroad from Guayaquil to Quito
is also to be completed in three * years
but the work on it will- be very, tedious
i as it is all up hill. American people have
botuicontracts^and I believe nearly all
the material will go from San Francisco.

Catarrh is a constitutional disease â a blood disease which is frequently
inherited, and only a blood medicine, such as S. S. S., can remove the hereditary
taint, destroy the poisons that have been accumulating in the system for years
perhaps and restore the blood to a healthy and pure condition. The inflamed
membranes and diseased glands are healed by the nch, pure blood which is carried
to them, and the offensive discharges from the nose, and the terrible headache and '
neuraMc pains cease. Chronic cases of the most desperate character and apparent-
ly hopeless, have been cured completely and permanently by the use of S. S. S. .

TIME REWARDS
MOTHER'S SEARCH
She claims that after her marriage to
Murphy in San Francisco more than ten
years ago his conduct became such that
she had to return to her parents in Kan
sas City with Viola, and that her for
mer husband- followed her, stealing the
child and coming to Los Angeles. She
started in pursuit, caught up with them
here and again lived with Murphy, whose
behavior, again* became unbearable. ' Then
she 1 left for ' Arizona, obtained a divorce
and remarried. . ' ' " ' ..
The 'mother, who : since parting from
Murphy . has again married, claims the
custody of the child by a decree made in
the District Court of Yuma on November
15, 1898, when she was granted a divorce.
Her version is different from that b 'iveii
by Murphy to the District Attorney and
the police. Her name now is Guidin. She
denies the > charge of having led on im
moral life in Arizona,, which Murphv has
circulated about her. ' . . . -
LOS ANGELES, June 1.â "Isn't 3 there
any way I can get my child out of that
Jail?" pitifully asked W\ H. Murphy of
Deputy District Attorney Willis this
afternoon.
Murphy, who seemingly is an honest
and good-hearted workingman, was near
ly frantic over the attempt of his for
mer wife and J. M. Methvin to kidnap
his 10-year-old girl.
Upon the advice of' her attorney, C. A.-
Stevens, the child's mother went to the
Boyd-street School on Friday afternoon
to speak with Mary Viola Murphy. The
permission was granted, and with J. M.
Methvin, who had been hired by her at
torney to assist the mother, the girl was
put into' a cab and' driven to the Arcade
depot. Two of the teachers plucklly pur
sued and the kidnapers left the Arcade
and were lost track of until word was re
ceived last night that they were at Sierra
Madre. There they I were arrested 1 and
brought to Los Angeles this morning.
Methvin was arraigned in the Jus
tice's Court and allowed to go on his
own recognizance. He was formerly 1 a
policeman in Los Angeles and later an oil
inspector. He acted lor Mrs. Murphy in
the capacity of a detective. The woman
Is still in the City Jail. On Monday she
will be arraigned for abduction. The lit
tle girl is in the City Jail, where she will
be kept until the courts decide which of

It was not expected that the inquest

sult in the production of any evidence
that would lead to the conviction â¢ of: any
one who assisted in the lynching.. Fear of
the vengeance the mountaineers. would
wreak upon informers seals the lips of the

day, while the vigilantes themselves are
not disposed to give any Information that
would place their own necks in jeopardy.

save that already given.
! LIBERAL, Kans., June Lâ George Mulli
gan, who claimed tc have been robbed of
117,000. in Seattle last night, left here last
Saturday with a company of thirty-four
young men, bound for the Klondike gold
fields. Ho was president of the Eagle
City Placer Gold Mining Company, made
up of Liberal men, and the money he lost
was principally that pa'.d him by the men
In thci company. Each man, before leav
ing, here, paid Mulligan $600, for which he
was- to pay all expenses to ' Eagle J City
and supply provisions for one y^ar. The
men signed contracts for five years' serv
ice, or. until the four mines controlled by
him should be worked out. '
; i SEATTLE, 1 June 1.â Thirty-four discon
solate Kansans sat on. the police head
quarters steps or haunted the office of the
clerk from early dawn until eve to-day.'
Their leader, George Mulligan, president
of the Eagle: City ; Placer Mining Com
pany, had been robbed, r they said,' of
$17,000. They had heard his statement to
that effect and they believed it. 'They
â¢aid that if/any of the Seattle, public
had any doubts as to the truth of George
Mulligan's statement when- he .told i the
Police Sergeant last night that he. had
been hit on the head and despoiled of
thousands, the public had better ..- taks
their example, for they knew that he was
a man of honor.. '<Â¦ ,â Â¦ , â¢ ' ,. v
Late in tbe afternoon' Mulligan walked
through the group of his associates that
was seated in 'front of the 1 headquarters.
He said not a won! to any: of them. He
went straight Inside and sought the office
of Chief Meredith. He knocked at the
door and was admitted. He sat down on
the lounge and looked the Chief squarely
in the eye. . .
"Chief," said he, "I lied to you."
"I know that," responded the guardian
of the city's peace.
"Yes," said Mulligan, "it's the first lie I
ever told and I am sick of it. I never was
robbed of that money. I hid it. in my
room. I wanted to try the boys to see' if
they were eood for the Yukonâ If they
would stick by me. They are all right.
But I wish that I had never tried the
scheme. I feel sick over it. You will find
part of the money in my overcoat, sewed
In the lining, and a part in the room, hid
den under the carpet." . â¢ Â¦'.-
Mulligan's statement was true. The
officers found each and every one of the
seventeen $1000. These they took charge
of with a view of restoring them to their
owners as soon as the affair was settled.

TELLS A FAKE
ROBBERY YARN
After their awful deed of violence was
committed the members of the mob dis
appeared like magic, and within five min
utes after the lynching there was not a
man to be seen near the scene of the
crime. The bodies dangling limply from
the bridge and the culvert were the only
evidences remaining to tell the story of
the tragedy. Â¦';'Â»Â¦!
Having fastened the ropes the vigi
lantes, without a moment's hesitancy,
without a qualm of conscience or a tithe
of pity for the wretches whose death
they had decreed, ruthlessly pushed their
victims oft the bridge. Each was given a
drop of about eight feet, sufficient In the
case of James Hall and Yantis to break
their necks. The old man and bis young
est son were slowly choked to death.
Having seen the life of Frank Hall
choked out, the mob hurried the four re
maining prisoners on toward the Pitt
River bridge. There again the disposition.
to get through with the work in hand as
quickly as possible was manifested. The
ropes by which the quartet had been led
were made fast to the timbers of the
bridge "While this was being done the
elder Hall wanted to speak, but his
gag was not removed. The prisoners,
from the time they had witnessed the ex
ecution of Frank Hall, appeared to be
dazed by the realization of the fate that
was upon them, but they showed little
cowardice. The â¢ younger lad, Martin, a
boy only 16 years . of age, was from the
outset the coolest of them all, and he
went to his death with the stoicism that
characterizes hJ* mother's race.

Frank Hall suddenly mada an attempt
to break^ free' from hl3 tormentors. He
was i quickly overpowered, . but he contin
ued to struggle: so despera-tely at each
attempt to drag him forward, that the
vigilantes, thlrstlngr for the lives of their
victims, were < enraged at the delay.
Frank Hall was dragged along- until the
crowd reached a 'small culvert spanning
a ditch at the outskirts of the town. Here
it was decided to put an end to his re
sistance and to the delay it was causing.
The rope noosed about his neck was fast
ened to- the railing- of the culvert and
Hall twas lifted bodily and hurled over
the side. The distance of the drop wa3
not great enough to break his neck, and
he slowly. strangled to death, in-the sight
of the four relatives who were soon to
share his fate. â¢ Â¦-. â¢ -

So quietly was the lynching Planned that
neither the prisoners nor their guards had
the slightest suspicion of danger. Itwas
shortly after 1 o'clock In the morning
when the door of the hotel office was sud

began filing into the room. Those in tne

on the" after midnight watcb-rcould offer
no resistance.- One of them, when tne
vigilantes first entered the door, realizing
their mission, did fire a bullet Into the

both of the " officers remonstrated elo
quently against rash- action on trie part
of the Invaders, but with a dozen revol
vers frowning upon, them they did not
press their argument. . . - - . - Â¦ Â¦ < â¢
It at once became . apparent that the
mob had planned its work well, for there
was no loss of time. The four prisoners
were seized: end hustled from, the room,
while. several men found their way to the
bedroom occupied by the . elder Hall and
dragged him forth. He was given time
enough to don only his outer garments
and then was hustled along with his sons
and son-in-law. The mob compelled the
guards to go along and take part in the
lynching. . - ,
Later details of the lynching learned to
day give proof that its was excessively
brutal. In front- of the hotel the mob
fastened nooses about the necks, or each
.of its victims and half dragged, halt led
them along Main street toward the large
bridge that spans Pitt. River near the
town. At first the wretches pleaded ag
onizingly for mercy, but â¢ their appeals
were met by taunts and Jeers, while those
having hold of the ropes hauled them this*
way 'and that and occasionally jerked

TOPEKA. Kans., June 1.â The Santa Fe
ls beginning Important reconstruction
work on its far western lines. The first,
as announced to-day; ls the relaying of
the track between Barstow and Mojave,
a distance of seventy-one miles, with 75
pound steel rails. The rails now used on
that particular portion of the line are of
56-BOund weight.
, Txie Postal and the Western Union com
panies are each preparing: to string new
wires along the Santa Fe's right of way.
The last named company has always had
a monopoly along the route of the Santa
Fe, but the Postal has now determined to
parallel its opponent and will use Its own
route throughout the entire distance.
When the fact became known to the
Western Union that company determined
to strentch an additional line and thus
have a new outlet to and from the Pa
cific Coast. Neither of these lines has as
yet been started.

ernor's Status Now
Questioned.
HONOLULU, May 2olâ The grand jury
called to investigate reports of bribery in
the Legislature is still in session and has
made no report so far. Circuit Judge
Humphreys' has released Attorney Gen
eral Dole and Treasurer Lansing from
testifying, on the ground that all they
had heard on the subject about which
the grand jury questioned them was hear
say, and they had given the names of
those from whcni they received reports.
In the cases og Acting Governor Coop
er and the ex-Superintendent of Public
Works, both of whom were cited to ap
pear before Judge Humphreys and show
cause why they should not answer the
questions put to them, decisions have not
yet been rendered. The grand jury is
calling many witnesses. . It is reported
that its investigations center around the
efforts of liquor men to . defeat the dis
pensary law and proposed legislation
having to do with the granting of fran
chises for the Honolulu Tramway Com
pany and the Honolulu Rapid Transit
and Land Company. . All of the directors
of the latter company have been sum
moned as witnesses.
The Legislature is still in session, con
sidering appropriations. It has received
I a letter from Acting Governor Cooper,
giving new estimates, but the home rul
ers will: probably cut them. They are
now engaged in making heavy cuts in the i
salaries of government officials and
clerks. The House tabled the estimates
of the acting Governor, to await a decis
ion as_to the legality of his status as
acting Governor, a question having
arisen in Judge Humphrey's court as to
his right to occupy such a position. At
torney General Dole has rendered an
opinion that i:e is legally acting Gov
ernor. Governor Dole is still at a
mountain resort and his physician has
ordered him to stay there longer.

HOLTOX, Kans., June 1.â The body of
Mrs. AI Klusmeier was found last night
buried in a shallow trench less than a
hundred yardsi from her home, one mile
north of Holtoh. The dead woman's head
was found to Tiave been crushed in as if
she had been struck with a club or some
heavy blunt instrument.
The crime was committed on Sunday,
May 19. On that day the children of the
family were away from home. When they
returned their father told them their
mother had gone to Texas on a visit.
Later Klusmeier left for Texas. Friday
the children received a telegram, from
him that their mother had died down
there of yellow^ fever and he had burled
her. ? Â¦ ' Â¦ "
Paul SwetUck, brother of Mrs. Klus
meier. was murdered in 1892, and the man
ner of his death was never explained. He

ciaries being Mr. and Mrs. Klusmeier.
Part of the insurance was contested and
a verdict for $38,000 was secured in favor
o^the estate in the United States Circuit
Court. The case was appealed and was
areued at St. Paul (Friday.
The whereabouts of the corpse of the
murdered woman vras made known by the
digging of dogs. They pawed the earth
and revealed the decomposing corpse -in
the shallow trench. There was not more
than two feet of eround <wf>r the hnHv .

To Father Robert Sesnon, "Wagnerlan
tenor and priest, a large share of the In
terest of the golden Jubilee performance
of the Santa Clara College Is due. It -will
be remembered that the new Passion Play
of Clay M. Greene is the chief feature of
the college ceremonies, and the musical
interlude, mostly sacred solos â¢with choral
and orchestral accompaniments, are In the
hands of Father Sesnon. The usual things
are sungâ "Noel," "The Holy City," "The
Palms"â but they are not sung In at all
the usual way. The singer has a power
ful dramatic tenor, used with strong in
telligence, and has an' admirable voice
quality and. method. For many years he
studied for the operatic stage, five years
In Paris with the teacher of De Reszke,
one in Milan with th-j elder Lampertl and
elsewhere with adequate advantage. "Lo
hengrin," "Faust" and ' "Romeo" are
among the parts studied .by the prlest
singep, and it Is easy to imagine his suc
cessful, appearance in . any one of them.
Father Sesnon entered upon his priestly
duties a year ago and is now a curate of
the Catholic church in San Rafael, amply
content with the tranquil life of a.coun
try priest. A strange story it is and no
light as to the reason of the great change
in his life ideals is given by the, priest,
but it is certain that the stage has lost
and the church gained a most effective
flsure. Â¦â¢"â¢ "'.' '"!Â»***"

IT is always a particular dellght,to me,
and commonly /worth the. effort; of
most music ; lovers. ' to ' attend the * oc
casional grand festival" Itallano to
which any city fortunate ' enough to
own a "Little Italy" Is. favored. The mu
sic ls>^usually good, the audience enthu
siastically en rapport with the musicians
and the whole affair distinguished by a
refreshing naturalness that Is a distinct
tonic to the nerves of the concert goer.
Such an affair was the "grand concert"
given the other evening at Sherman-Clay
Hall, in aid of the: Sts. Peter and
Paul organ fund, j where a goodly
programme was rendered by eleven mem
bers of the Italian^ colony here.. Giuseppe
Panizza, who was 'called upon at the last
moment to substitute -. for Slgnor'Ave
dano, ,was undoubtedly the bright par
ticular star, of the evening. "He gave the
"Largo ar Factotum": with utmost 'gusto,
conscientiously conceiving It his duty to
ward the audience to act out the part, in
spite of such small obstacles as . modern
tailoring and shoes that sympathetically
creaked with every step.' Slgnor Panizza
got the encore of the evening, and I did
my small best to help him there.
Miss Lydia and Miss Angle' Spadlna
gave a very musical rendering of a Mer
cadante duet from "II Giuramento," dis
tinguished by its excellent ensemble, and
the good voice quality, of both singers.
Pietro Marino played the Vieuxtemps
fifth concerto In satisfactory fashion:
Quinto Zani's good voice and bad rhythm
were hear. In the "I Pagllacd" prologue;
Slgnor Pio Face! sang with much taste
the Braga ' "Romanza," and also.', with
Sig.~ Zani. a duet from "Forza del Des
tino." Miss Mignon Schocken got more
out of that Intrinsically unmusical in
strument,- the naandolin, than I have yet
heard in my carefully scant experience,
and with A. Spadlna, R. Laraja and S.
Martinez gave a concerted number for
two mandolins, lute and piano. Mrs."
Eugene Cadenasso substituted effectively
for Lla Polettini, and Signor Martinez
accompanied capably. The organ fund
of. Sts. Peter and Paul must have con
siderably benefited, for ' the house, was

flaccid, facile and effected Dudley Buck

effective in the Oriental "Ught of Asia.'*
The chorus was not too well Interpreted,
Its lack of form not conducing to an
easy grasp of its difficulties, and Mr. E.
Moore grave the solo in rather half -hearted
fashion. The Beethoven chorus was sung:
with a fine swing and encouraging spirit
and some of the lighter numbers wera
rendered with happy delicacy. A pleas

COLONEL WATTERSON abandons himself to excitement about The Call. He re
cently discovered that the fate and future of the United States depend upon Cuba. It
- is known. that the South desires Cuban annexation, regardless of our pledge of inde
pendence in our- declaration of war against Spain. The colonel, who in certain moods
sees visions and dreams dreams, and moves uneasily in his sleep, in giving support to this Southern
idea, discovered that what happens to Cuba happens to the United States. If that island .is. un
happy we paw dust on our. backs and bellow. He gives no explanation of his theory, no reason
why we cannot go on shooting Governors in Kentucky and burning, negroes in Kansas, and con
tinue indulging in other national games, even if the dark, tempestuous Caribbean Sea swallow
Cuba, fever, fleas and all. . , ; ; .
Whether our dependence on Cuba for perpetuity and happiness be uttered by John Quincy
Adams or a Kentucky colonel, suggesting that alliance between Blifil: and Black George which
occurred to the fertile fancy of Randolph in: 1825, it is. a mere groupof words with no foundation
in fact or common sense. t
As well might Colonel Watterson say that a sequence at poker in a Louisville card fight is
inextricably linked in fate and destiny with a game of authors in a San Francisco Sunday-school.:
But when The Call asked him for some reason for the words which he emitted, he makes
an anatomical retort and talks about the displacement of our liver! "*\
. . He should not , assume that, because* he passes gall stones for editorial, all livers are on bad
terms with their owners. His' hepatic argument is as wanting in application as his insular-coriti
nental-relation-and-community-of-fate" theory. Because a, liver in Kentucky turns hard from hav
ing to deal with that mixture of. weeds and liquor which is the popular tipple in those parts, he
should not generalize as to all livers.
We would willingly share our climate with him.' for the help and Healing of nis liver, and also
our views to brighten riis lights, but we beg of him to believe that the frying-pan, ; hot bread and
bourbon do not mobilize in the North and march against the liver, overtake and do it up after the.

Perhaps his theory is that Cuba is the .'liver of the .United States. In tliat way only can we

THE YOSEMITE COMMISSION.
Editor Call: The Examiner, in mention
ing: the Yosemite Commission, says:
"The commission will meet in the val
ley one week from to-day and show that,
whereas, the John P. Irish Board turned
things over to it nearly $3000 in debt, it
now has over $2500 in its revolving fund,
etc."
I have not been a member of the Yo
semite Commission since 1894, and am not
familiar with what has been done in the
Beven years intervening. The board of '<
which I was a member turned nothing
over in debt. â¢ to the amount of $3000 or
any other sum. It rebuilt the Sentinel
Hotel and the cottages conne'eted with it
creating a fine property for the State.
The house was old and was a blemish
for the valley, yielding no income. When
we transformed i.t it was immediately
leased for an annual rental amounting- to
10 per cent on the cost of its improve
ment. As the commission had not" all
the funds on hand required for the recon
struction, this income of the property
was hypothecated to make up the bal
ance, and -in Jue time wiped it out.
The Stoneman House never rented for
more than 2 per cent, of its cost and
as it was burned under the management
of the successor . to the "John P. Irish
Board," the valley would have been with
out a hotel had we not reblullt the Sen
tinel.
Being unfamiliar with the work of the
present managers of the valley, I assume
that it has been good, and that the in
come from the lease o- the Sentinel Hotel
has contributed most of the surpl&s now
In the revolving fund.
It is certain that if we had not built
that house out cf the' revolving fund, our
successors would have been compelled to
ask for an appropriation from the State
treasury to provide a hotel after the
Stoneman House gave up the ghost. This
was prevented by our foresight and
sound financiering. - Â¦ Very truly,

In regard to tenements and temporary, lodging-houses, an investigation in the large cities of \
this country demonstrates that the, people who would be the beneficiaries of such paternalism are,
as a rule, the immigrants who come to us from the paternal governments of Europe, and not
Americans reared to self-helpfulness and independence. '
In its wider outline, then, the proposition to adopt municipal paternalism in this country
is a proposition to reverse the direction of our government, change its purpose and spirit, and
accommodate it to the inherited quality of imported character that was formed under .the anti
podes of the American idea.- But all this is to be done in the presence of universal suffrage and
without change in the operation of American partisan â politics. It is to-be an. attempt to convert*
to the uses of paternalism a rion-paternal form' of government. ' ' .
Formed upon the theory that government has no business. to be in business, this govern
ment in a lapse of a century, and twelve years under the constitution has developed the strongest
people in the world. Systems are to be judged by/results. The opportunity for advancement, the.
ample scope here given to individual energy; and genius, make the United' States increasingly at
tractive to the people of the world. The tide of â¢human movement is hitherward, not hence. The'
municipal paternalism of Europe does .not "attract immigration of our native population from the
United States to enjoy the shelter of tenements ' and lodging-houses, baths and medicines, light,
water and transportation under municipal ownership. Therefore may not the advocates of the
non-paternal system plead that it is better for man not to immerse him in the dependence of state
communism, and better for government to confine it to governing and exclude it from business?
It would seem to be certain- that surrender to the physical assertion of paternal govern
ment may in the next century and twelve years impress upon the- spirit of our people that same
dependence which is characteristic of European populations. ;
Systems must be judged "by the results not of one year, the balance sheets of a decade, nor'
the effect upon one generation, but by their prolonged practice upon many generations and
through many decades. '
Already in this country the energetic school that promotes municipal, paternalism has be-,
gun the advocacy of what it- calls the free, supply of public utilities to the people, meaning^thereby
that water, light and transportation shall -be afforded at the expense of the municipalityâ that^ is'
to say of the taxpayer. In. the^city.^f Buffalo. this proposition has been submitted-to the Common
Council and was indorsed by nearly half 'the 'Â¦Â¦members.' .Between that arid the supply ~of free boa'rd"
and lodging there is a very thin margin'.that 'can be;' easily crossed if the first step be taken. This"
cult is in the air. It is asserting itself among the forces that control public opinion, and is already?
a power to be reckoned with. The politicians, are reckless in adopting it, for it may make votes,
office, power and salaries. |But the philosophic mind may "well consider the portentous change in
our polity which it must inevitably produce. â¢ /
r I "> HE American scheme , of government was, throughout, an emergence from and rejection
I of paternalism. Its spirit was thaVof the police powei, solely: The duty,of government
I , was to the maintenance of public order, protection of. personal and - prop-'
_ erty rights, and .otherwise freedom of the individual to work out his own destiny. Such
scheme in its beginning conformed to. the independent spirit of the people, and was believed
capable of making that spirit a permanent quality in the- 'American character, and a lasting force
in our social organism. . ! " '
â¢,6 .>.Â£â¢â¢.-. It niay now.be in order, to note -the progressive change that is taking place, as .the result
perhaps of the too rapid reception into our; population of immigrants reared and inbred in tHe cus
toms of. government paternalism that prevail in Europe. In the British isles, in France, Aus
tria, Germany, Belgium, Norway, and even in Russia, paternalism .goes to the extent, of assuming
as matters of municipal concern the provision of houses, railways,- gas,' water,' electricity, insur
ance, saving banks x medicine^ civil pension's and daily occupation for the people. The public service
industries in the list are made- to -yield* a ; profit to the? paternal government. In Glasgow the
city furnishes two-roomed housesTfor a rental of $3 25 per month,, temporary night lodgings, baths,
etc., and clears 5 per cent per annum on the investment.- This method is in practice in other
European cities, paying also a profit in excess of the ordinary returns on private capital in similar
use in the United States. . : '. / ; . ' â¢
But it must be noted that all this is everywhere done under the operation of complete
paternalism, and the beneficiaries of the system are people who are willing to have such things
done for them. - ' Â¦ Â¦" ; ' \ h;/v.
f'Tour theory is astonishing," I said, 1
"but far more rational than Donnelly's
and not nearly so far-fetched as some of
the assumptions in that ton-of-a-book
which George Brandes has recently
dumped on the dust-heap of Shake
spearean commentary. Why don't you
throw it out .as a tub for critic whales to
charge at?"
"I don't pretend to be a professional
writer." said the Lady with dignity, "but
I'll make you a present of the Idea if you
care to write it up."
So that is how this dialogue came to be
recorded.

"Those other men, the ladder upon
which Shakespeare climbed to reputation,
were his contemporary dramatistsâ men
like John Lyly, Thomas Lodge, Robert
Greene, George Peele, Christopher Mar
lowe, Thomas Nash, George Chapman,
Thomas Kyd. Thomas Mlddleton and John
Fletcherâ most of them men of wild life
and utterly lacking in that commercial in
stinct, that shrewd practical common
sense which is so striking a characteristic
of Shakespeare. These men, or most
of them, were constantly In debt. When
harassed by bailiffs they would come to
Shakespeare and sell him a play or the
scenario of a play. This he would work
over himself or more probably get some
other poetry-stricken dramatist to work
over. The result is what we have In the
anthology that goes under the title of
the Shakespearean drama. That this an
thology should have been the work of one
man, and such a man as Shakespeare, Is
incredible. My theory perfectly explains
its depth, its range, its variety and its
beauty, for it is the product collected by
Manager Shakespeare, the Frohman of his
age, of all the good dramatic poets of the
Elizabethan era." .
sixteen years before at Hampton Court
called 'The Historic of Error.' Now, I
agree with Mr. Sidney Lee, if you don't,
Â¦when he Bays that 'such plays as these,
although each gave promise of a dramatic
capacity out of the common way, cannot
be with certainty pronounced to be be
yond the ability of other "men." " v '^: :>Â¦.
"But you. forget that Shakespeare glori
ously redeemed this promise by the com
position - of his next play, 'Romeo and
Juliet.-' " ;
"I can't forget it.' because I never be
lieved It. I do not allow that he wrote
that play." . ' . â¢
"Then who did?" asked I, amazed/
"That's where my theory, comes in." re
sponded the Lady cheerfully. "Having
established, as above, an antecedent im
probability that he could write such a
play, I now find it reasonable to suppose
that HE was just as capable of recog
nizing his Incapacity as . I am. Having
recognized it, what was he to do? Depend
upon his meage.r earnings as a bad actor?
He was too ambitious for that. Abandon
the theatrical business? Not while there
was an opportunity of making money out
of It by In any way utilizing the experi
ence he had gained during his ! prentice
years."
"Given the well-known conditions of
the stage In 1592, I fall to see any , such
opportunity," said I, decisively!
"That's because you're not a Shake
speare," announced the . Lady authorita
tively. "He saw the tide rising in the
affairs of OTHER men, which, taken at
the flood, was to lead HIM on to fortune.
He took It, and, supported thereby,' rode
triumphantly into the harbor of reputa
tion and riches. The other men were
drowned."
"Drowned!" I exclaimed with a ehud
der. "Who were they? Who drowned
them?" ' .
"Shakespeare drowned them, of course.
And do you really mean to say. you don't
know who they were?" . .
"With shame and contrition, I must con
fess I haven't the remotest Idea."
"Next, it's the same old story. His .next
play. 'The Comedy of Errors,' Is nothing
but a wild farce, not only based upon a
most glaring Improbabilityâ which is par
donable, but containing contradictions
and breaks in the logic of development
which are quite unpardonable. Besides,
most of the good things In it are taken
from Plautus or from an old play acted
"Because Shakespeare was ashamed to
own it. He put his name on the title page
of 'Love's Labor's Lost,' published In
quarto in 1598, but he never acknowledged
'The Two Gentlemen of Verona,' which
was not published until seven years after
his death."
"Tour argument Is ingenious if not cor
rect. What nipxt?"
"Indeed? How do you know?"
"Well, after he had done so poorly with
an original plot he thought he'd steal ose
next time, bo he borrowed from the Earl
of Southampton Wilson's manuscript
translation of Montemayor's Spanish ro
mance. 'Diana,' He had to read it in a
translation, of course, as he knew no lan
guage but his own and that not very well
â suffering, as Matthew Arnold so . well
says, 'from the defects of a bad educa
tion.' Then he found In the property
room of the Shored.tch Theater the man
uscript of an old play called 'Felix and
Philomena,' acted in 1548, and by putting
these two together he patched out an
adaptation' which he called 'The Two
Gentlemen of Verona.' That was a fail
ure, too."
"I see; go on, I beg."
"Of courseâ tried and failed. The evi
dence is perfectly clear for that. His first
play was 'Love's Labor's Lost,' the only
play for which he ever originated a plot
and certainly the poorest of all those that
go under his name. It Is utterly unread
able to-day and has proved utterly inca
pable of holding the stage. When it was
published in 1598 it was certainly no better
than It Is 303 years later. It Is a failure
now; so It must have been a failure then."
'â¢Tried and failed!"
"Well, it's Just this." said the Lady with
the utmost seriousness: "After Shake
speare had tried playwrltlng and failedâ"
"I pray you, expound."
"Then who did? They didn't descend
from the heavens above, nor yet did they
arise from the waters beneath."
"I have a theory â much better than
Donnelly's."
"JCot entirely."
"Well, I do," said, the Lady, with con
viction, "and that settles it eo far as I am
concerned. I tell you that Shakespeare,
being what he was. COULDN'T have writ
ten all those lovely plays."
I HAVE a great contempt for the
theory that Bacon wrote Shake
speare." said the Lady of Large Dis
crimination; "Donnelly's cryptogram
la a Â¦ fraud upon the face of It. yet
I hare a secret sympathy for what Don
nelly waa trying to do. He had just the
eame feeling abottt Shakespeare I ve often
had myself." Â«_w*
"And what was that, pray?' 1 â¢ as^ d
very meekly, for it was evident that the
Lady was terribly In earnest
"I have often felt." she replied unhesi
tatingly, "that such a man as we know
Shakespeare to have been could never
have written such beautiful plays and so
many of them. Just think; a country
lout with little or no education, a fugi
tive from Justice, a holder of horses
around theater doors, a hanger-on behind
â¢ the scenes, a poor actor In small parts,
a hard drinker and a close-flsted land
lord, a parasite at rich men's tablesââ
"Hold, hold!" I said deprecatlngly. the
evidence for the accusations you hurl at
the Bweetest-tempered soul " t
"SwÂ«etest-tempered fiddlesticks, re
plied the Lady; "and as for evidence, can
you deny that the facts, as given In any
good life of Shakespeare, will bear^the
Interpretation I have put on them?'
"I admit they will bear that Interpreta
tion, but etill that Is not the Interpreta
" tlon a charitable man would put on
them." i
"Charitable MAN, Indeed! Charitable
MAN! Of course not. That's because
you're a man, Tou men always hang to
gether. Suppose, now. that Shakespeare
had been a woman and had done all those
things; would you believe she could have
created such, characters as Portia and
Miranda?"
"I must confess that I never heard of a
food .book being written by a bad wo
man."
"Nor by a bad man. either," replied the
Lady, triumphantly. "What Is It Milton
says? 'Before a man can be a good poet
he must be a good man.' Don't you be-
Hevo that?"

was able to travel all over the Island and
he and his party had a most delightful

"Great preparations are being made at
Papeete for the celebration of the Fall of
the Bastile," said Mr. Samuels yesterday
"Governor Petit is golng'to the Marquesas
and the Australia will pick him up on the
next voyage to Tahiti. With him go 300
Marquesans who are to take part in the
two days' festival. On the return trip the
Australia will take the natives back to
their homes. The celebration will be the
finest ever seen in Tahiti and will be
worth going half way around the . world
to see." .â¢
Tourists to Tahiti will get full value for
their money on the next trip of the Aus
tralia. There will be a call at the Mar
quesas, four coral groups will be passed
on the way and then there will be the
festival. The French gunboat Zelee was

Unless more, than one-half of. the local
production of at Losy Angeles
is pledged " to the agreement formulated
by the Producers' Association, the com

to the marketing and handling of the oil,
securing better rates for hauling, if pos
sible, before an attempt will be made to
set a new market value. This intention
of the parties in Interest is stated by the
Los Angeles Times. It -therefore appears
that not one-half is yet signed. A meet
ing of all the lecal producers at Los An
geles has been called for the purpose of
giving information to those who do not
thoroughly understand the proposition.
Many of the smaller producers have not
been conversant with the plan in all of
its details. Oil is now selling at from 70
to 75 cents per barrel at Los Angeles. The
price may be put at 85 cents per barrel
by the comblna as a starter when the
time comes, this being dependent upon
the association getting the handling of

eeason than for many years. Messrs. Case and
Alley have had a good run â¢ with â¢ their small
hydraulic plant, and, it is reported, have
made a good clean-up. A great deal of other
work has been done, but most of it ln a small
way, either . with > a small - string Â¦ of sluice
boxes or with the old-time rocker. This dis
trict would be a large producer if water could
be had on the hill gravel, which is often very
good. There are several square miles of coun
try ; that is well covered . with gravel varying
from 6 cents to II per > cubic yard. In many
places this , gravel reaches a great thickness,
sometimes as much as sixty feet. All of the
email gulches carry' enough gold that yield
returns with a rocker. The district has been
worked more or less for thirty years, and it is

BTJPBEME COURT DECIDES
TO HEAB, BEGEBOW CASE
Habeas Corpus Writ Issued in Matter
of Deputy Sheriff Charged
With" Murder.
Fred Begerow. the San Jose Deputy
Sheriff who shot and killed Joseph Cech
and August BergÂ«r at a. brewers' picnic
last July, has been granted a hearing be
fore the Supreme Court and will appear
before that body to-morrow afternoon on
a writ of habeas corpus. Begerow has al
ready had four trials and each time the
Jury has disagreed. A new trial has been
fet for June 10. His attorneys want the
case decided immediately and hence their
application.
Beg-erow, while In an Intoxicated condi
tion, attempted to arrest George Schmled
of San Francisco when he was remon-
Etrated with by Cech and Berger. Step
ping off a few paces he turned and shot
them both. He was much bruised and
beaten and narrowly escaped lynching by
an angry mob immediately after the deed.
His defense is that he was interfered with
In the discharge of his duty and that he
acted In self-defense.
For the last ten years there has been
an increase of 2000 annually in the num
ber of Great Britain's insane. < .-

There seems no doubt that the case Is
one of suicide. No writing was found
that would furnish a clew as to the mo

that he was very poor. Despondency was
the probable cause of the rash deed.

The Board of Public Works yesterday
transmitted to the Board " of Supervisors
the report of the City Engineer with ref
erence to the construction of a tunnel
through Telegraph Hill, together with
plans and maps appertaining thereto. The
report Is the result of a communication
filed by the North Central Improvement
Association, last December, directing at
tention" to the necessity of. extending
Montgomery street from Jackson to Lom
bard by means of a 'tunnel, thereby ; af
fording direct communication with the
business part of San Francisco and the
new wharves now being constructed- by
the Harbor Commissioners.
The estimated. cost of the construction
of the proposed tunnel, including ap
proaches, is fixed at $30S,489 and the dam
age to property fronting on Montgomery
street in the blocks in which .approaches
are located is estimated at $38,183. The
report says: . . = ;
The 'width of a tunnel under Telegraph Hill
should be at least thirty feet, located alone
Montgomery street the tunnel should commence
between Jeckson and Pacific streets and ter-~
minate between Greenwich and Lombard. . The'
tunnel approach at I the southerly end would
have a length of 215 feet and at the northerly
end 45 feet. The ' tunnel from portal Â¦ to portal
would have a lenpth of 2415 feet. A blfumln
ous rock pavement is made the basis of the
paving estimate. A narrow sidewalk five feet
wide la to be provided alone the east side of
the tunnel. The tunnel Ik to be so placed that
It will not completely obstruct traffic on Mont
gomery street at its south portal. There will
be a six-foot sidewalk between tunnel ap
proach and the east side building line' and on
the west an J 18-foot roadway and a : six-foot
sidewalk. ..*.Â¦â¢Â¦'Â¦ Â¦'. . . ;
I do not wish to be understood as favoring
this tunnel construction, because I believe that
a rational treatment of the eastern and north
ern hill elopes will afford better access to the
North Beach district and along two streets
with a j tunnel of less . than one-half of the
length on only one of these routes.. The con
struction of a direct tunnel, the main objec
tion to which is its great length, should not
be approved or condemned until the hill treat
ment is finally agreed upon by the Supervisors.
Green street. Â¦ Calhoun, Lombard, Filbert and
Wlnthrop streets are all below grade on the
hill and the grades should be revised at once.
Another method which . would add ' a consider
able area to the commercial district will be
to lower grades on Sansome street, between
Jackson and Chestnut. . . â¢ : Â¦
Should It be determined . to Improve Â¦ Tele
graph Hill the execution of the project may be
subdivided - into three subprojects: ,(1) The
lowering of grades on Sansome and adjacent
streets; (2) the acquisition by the city of ad
joining blocks and lots; (3) the construction of
a tunnel 950 feet long and a proposed - new
street. . The . cost of making this : general im
provement would be: Real estate to be pur
chased, includlnc the southeasterly portion of
Pioneer Park block, $123, 780; 'grade changes on
Sansome street, including bridge at Broadway
and Sansome street . and reconstruction of
pavements 'and sidewalks westerly from San
some street, $75,030; â¢ tunnel : construction, stair
ways, parapets, including paving of entire new
street, $230,990. >.The amount â¢ of grading in
volved will require the excavation of 1,539,300
cubic yards. . *.' â¢- "" . .'.:./

A Free Trial PackacreSent by Mail
. to All Who Write. >
Free trial packages of a most remarka-
ble remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years .against the mental and
physical- sulfering of lost manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute free
trial packages to all who write. It "is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any form of sexual weakness result-
ing from youthful folly, premature loss
oZ strength and memory, weak back, vari-
cocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home. .
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
anil development just where it is needed
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years* of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute. 328 Elektron building. Fort
Wayne, Ind., statin??, thafyou desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
â¢who are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free sample'will enable them
to see how easy it is to be cured of sex-
ual .weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute 'makes no
restrictions. Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed in a
plain . package, so that its Â¦ recipient need
have no. fear of embarrassment or pub-
lrcity. Readers : are requested to write

Water Front Notes.
Many years ago the British ship Sslena
went to Santa Rosalia with a general
cargo. A storm came up and she was
driven ashore. Many an attempt 'was
made to get her off, and T. P. H. White
law, the wrecker, worked on her for
months. Finally the job was given up
and the wreck was sold for a song. Its
new owner has made a Â¦warehouse out of
-the two upper holds, while the water ebbs
and flows through the lower one.
When Edwin Goodall of Goodall, Per
kins & Co. was in Mexico he took a pic
ture of the old hulk. Strange to say Cap
tain England of the British ship Thistle
was at Santa Rosalia at the time and told
Mr. Goodall that he was master of the
Selena at the time she went ashore. The
accompanying cut is from the snap shot
made by Mr. Goodall.

The fate of the missing American ship
John McDonald has been partially clear
ed up by a. letter . received from Captain
W. Lewis of the ship Elwell. It is dat
ed Newcastle. Aus.. April 27 last, and
was addressed . to W. E. Mighell, presi
dent of the California Ship Company,
owners of -the John McDonald. In his
communication Captain Lewis said he
read about the fears for the McDonald
and spoke to the captain of the British
bark Adderly about her. The latter ship
left Tacoma early In January for Sydney
and the captain says that on January 16
last, in latitude 36 degrees north, longi
tude 134 degrees west, he spoke the John
McDonald and exchanged signals "with
her. Captain Watts signaled that he
was from Baltimore for San Francisco,
and later hoisted two flags which the
captain of the Adderly look to be "N.
M." The signal- letters N. M- mean "ship
on fire." and the general impression in
chipping circles is that the John McDon
ald blew up and all hands perished al
most within sight of port. ;

tree on which the beneficial insect was at
work and sent It to San . Francisco. It
has grown steadily since last October,
and three days ago the bugs began to de
velop. This little mite from which such
great things are expected is hardly visi

home in the scale which the orchardists
are so anxious to get rid of.

resort to Humphreys' j Specifics for aid
and cure In their illness, have less sick-
ness, better health, better growth,' longer

explained in the circumstance that these

FRESH AT NIGHL
If One "Uses the Bight Kind of Food.
If by proper selection of food one can
feel strong and fresh at the end of a day's
work, it is worth while to know the kind
of food that will produce this result. .
A school teacher of Media, Kans., says
In this connection: "I commenced the
use of Grape-Xuts Food five months a&o.
At 'that time my health was so poor that
I thought I would have to give up nay
work altogether. I -was rapidly losing In
â¢weight, ?iad little appetite, waa nervous
and sleepless, and experienced almost con-
stantly a 'feeling of exhaustion. I tried
various remedies without good results:
then I determined to give particular at-
tention to rny food, and have learned
something of the properties of Grape-
Nuts for rebuilding the brain and nerve
. centers. :.'.;- ; Â¦''.'Â¦''.'.[ 'Â¦'.'â¢'
"1 commenced using that food and have
since made a constant and rapid Improve-
ment In health In spite of the fact that all
this time I have been engaged in the most
strenuous and exacting work. â¢ : . % . .
"I have gained twelve pounds In weight
and have a rood appetite; "my nerves are
steady and I sleep sound. . I .have such
strength and reserve force that I feel al- 'Â¦
most as etroxLsr and fresh at the close of
a day** work as at the beginning.
"Before using Grape-Nuts I was. trou-
bled much with weak eyes, but as my
vitality Increased the eyes became strong-
er. I never heard of food as nutritious
and economical as Grape-Nuts! Please
omit my name from r-!nt-" Name can be

MARVIN FORD
FOUND GUILTY
Jury Recommends Him
to the Mercy of the
Court.
? Â¦Â¦; : -.
The trial of Marvin E. Ford, the shoe
drummer, charged with beating and rob
bing Lee Leong, a Chinaman, on Commer
cial street February 16. was concluded
before a Jury in Judge Lawlor's court yes
terday. At midnight the jury brought in
e verdict of guilty as charged, with a
recommendation of mercy.
Drs. D. D. Lustig and John "W.
Robinson testified that they believed the
defendant was Insane when he committed
the act. Dr. Robinson, who conducts a
sanitarium In Llvermore, admitted, how
<SÂ»er, that the defendant knew the nature
' Judge Maguire, representing Gin Leong
Gow, in his argument, stated that it was
the object of the Chinese Consul General
an4 the Six Comnanies in supporting Gin
Leong Gow in this action to make known
their objections-to the scheme now being
operated to - take â¢ Chinese children s from
their, homes "for the sole purpose of forc
ing upon them an alien religion," '.which;
he said, alienated the children from' their
people and was naturally opposed by the
parents. â¢ ". - ". * , a - "â¢
Judge Coffey, however, pointed out that,
though such objections might exist among
the Chinese, in. this -case itwas In evi
dence that Gin Leong- Gow sent one ; of his
children to another mission to learn - the
ways and perhaps to yield to the forceful
Influence of < the Presbyterian creed. Judge
Coffey paid a tribute to the intellectuality,
integrity and learning of Consul General
Ho â¢ Tow and â voiced - hia appreciation Â¦ of
the position occupied by/ the. Chinese dip
lomats in the case. Then,, continuing,- in
logical and forceful , terms Judge Coffey
advanced to his r conclusion that, being of
sufficient age, Knm, .Ying might: intelli
gently Â¦ express ' her, wishes . and .that,â¢'fur
thermore,- being in 'America, the religion
of these Americans who will henceforth
care for her : might well" be hers." The , or
der granting Miss Cameron's petition was
then made.- Â¦>â¢ Â¦;?..-"-> - - - - - 4 <?Â¦Â«.-..

When Gin Leong Gow left the stand a
surprise followed. Wong Lung, who had
been nominated by Gin Leong Gow as a
suitable person to â¢ be appointed aa the
child's guardian, refused to act.- He had
heard the child' talk, he said. . She was
too smart. Better get somebody with a
bigger house. Lee Bow Sun was suggest
ed,- and stated that he would care for the
child as his own if: the court would honor
him with the appointment. - .
Little Kura Ting's wish to be permitted
to trust her spiritual -welfare, to what
Judge Coffey termed "the somewhat; rigid
doctrines of the Presbyterian church," in
stead of kneeling before the tinsel joshes
in homage to "the liberal views of.Con
fucius," has been granted." .'Judge Coffey
made an order yesterday granting the pe
tition of Donaldina Cameron of; the Pres
byterian Mission for letters of guardian
ship upon the person and estate of the
tiny Celestial maiden, which defeats the
effort of her master, Gin Leong Gow," in
whose home she was cruelly abused.. to
regain her custody. . â¢ "â¢ : -v_:
Yesterday afternoon Gin Leong Gow put
on his witnesses in opposition to Miss
Cameron's petition, but long before Attor
ney Henry E.'Munroe, representing Miss
Cameron, ha(# exercised his full I knowl
edge of the art of cross-examination he
had his case won and Gin Leong Gow
and his witnesses hopelessly tangled.
When the hearing waa opened Gin Leong
Gow claimed he was the child's father.
Yesterday- he reluctantly admitted, that
he was the child's foster father; -that he
had adopted her according to a method
wh;ch Consul General Ho Yow in his affi
davit stated was the custom prevailing in
China for the apprenticing of children for
domestic service. ' : ,;

The arguments of counsel occupied con
siderable time. Assistant District Attor
ney Alvord and Attorney J. C. Campbell
spoke for the prosecution and Colonel
Barry for the defendant. Alvord made the
closing argument, and Just as he was
about to tinish the defendant's mother,
Mrs. Pauline Ford, became hysterical and
made a scene in court. She rose t to her
feet, and throwing her arms out toward
the jury shrieked out that her son was in
sane. The Judge instructed 'Bailiff Colter
to preserve order in court, and added that
if people could not control their emotions
they had better stay outside the court
room. He admonished the jury to over
look these emotional exhibitions and de
cide the case on the law and the evidence.
Mrs. Ford was led out of the courtroom
by the ballllf and- her daughter-in-law,
who was weepin^bitterly.
After the arguments the Judge charged
the jury, dwelling carefully on what was

The Naval Militia did not appear in the
Memorial day parade to do' honor to .the
memory of the heroes of "'the Civil and

after that time, just fifteen minutes after

were ordered back to | the ship and they
obeyed, but were very much disappointed
that they did not have an opportunity. to

Â¦ the -militia. -was at the point from which
the procession was .to move and was
asked where his command was. To Cap
tain E^H. Plummer, grand- marshal; who
asked the question, the commander of the

FromMp. Ernest C. Stock,
FRATERNAL EDITOR OF THE SAN FRAN-
clsoo "Dally Call." -whose career as a Journalist
has been marked with brilliant - success, after
using Mayerle's glasses for more- than three
yean, highly appreciates their superiority, and
sends the following testimonial:
â¢ Â¦ - ' Ban Francisco, March* 4,* 1901. '
.MR. GEO. MAYERLB, Optician. San B-ran-
cisco, Cal. : Agreeable - to promise that after
two years' use : of the glasses . you . fitted to
my sight I would * tell you Â¦ What I thought â¢ of
them, I take pleasure In writing. I have never
had so much comfort In the use of glasses as
. I had ' with those procured from ' you. Their
use has demonstrated that they restored
normal sight, and I add further that the dally
use of them for many hours . by day and by
night has ' not . produced any strain on the
eyes,, such as I experienced with other glasses.
Respectfully; ERNEST C. STOCK.
Mayerle's glasses are far superior to all oth-
ers for I reading or distance, weak eyes, poor
eight, :, headaches, dizziness, . cloudiness of
vision, floating spots, pains about the eyes,
behind the head . or temples, nervousness, sore I
eyes, discharging eyes, feeling- like sand in the !
eyes, Â¦ cross eyes, burning, smarting, < itching,
scratching, jj twitching, '. gluey : or 5 discharging
eyes, heavy eyelids, etc. Mayerle's glasses. rest
the eyes, strengthen' the optic . nerve and pre-
serve the sight. Mayerle's glasses are. now
used by the highest United States Army,. Navy
and Government officials. _ . . . .; 1

a question that is of much public Interest.
Captain Lawrence and Lieutenant Sabine
were informed by the lighting company
that they must either resign their offices
in the National Guard or give up their po
sitions with the company. '
Captain Lawrence Is a veteran of ' the

In the ' Philippines. When he came back

standing rule that no employe may hold
office in any club or organization of .any

"WASHINGTON. June 1.â The findings
in the case of Captain "William Hancock,
Sixth Artillery, who recently, was tried by
court-martial at Manila on charges of
"conduct to the prejudice of good order
and military discipline." and falling to
appear for duty on two occasions, have
been received at the War Department.
The specifications allege that Hancock ex
hibited himself In a drunken condition at
the Armv and Navy Club at Manila on
two occasions and by constant indulgence
In drink rendered himself unfit for mili
tary duty. He was found guilty of both
charges and was sentenced to be repri
manded in orders -by the brigade com
mander. . 5. ; . >"'.?V
The latter, J. F. Bell, in approving the
findings and carrying the sentence Into ef
fect rebukes the accused for the character
of the defense, in v.'tiich, It Is stated, he
attacks the motive of every one connected
with the bringing in of the accusation
against him, but shows not the slightest
appreciation of the reprehensible char
acter of .his conduct.
General Bell delivers a warning to the
officer as to the future.- saying that "it
might be beneficial to him to reflect that
an officer twice tried for Intemperance
within.' nine moryths is 5n danger - of ex
haustingr the patience of hiF friends and
has used up any credit which might-at

ry W. Howgate. formerly chief signal offi
cer in the United States army, died sud
denly this afternoon of cerebral ! hem
orrhage at his hom^ in this city: H& was
67 years of age.
Â¦-. Captain Howgate had a ' singular and
eventful life. While a '.trusted officer of
the signal service he was charged with
appropriating a large amount of Govern
ment funds and placed under arrest. His
escape and .flight were attended .with',
many dramatic features, for by a ruse he
got away from a Government officer having
I him in -charge; while the latter supposed
Ms prisoner was taking a bath. r For years
he remained In hiding, and not until "four'
years after, his escape was he located by
eecret service detectives y as proprietor of.
f an obscure bookstore in New -York. For
some time before his actual re-arrest, the '
authorities .were aware of his'presence In
â¢New - York, but they ; were' disinclined to
take him into .custody, as there ,was con-'
stderable doubt concerning the evidence In'
the old case. Â¦ * '
â¢It was finally decided to bring him back,
and former Chief Drummond made the
arrest. He was brought back here,, tried
and convicted. After . serving a sentence
in the Albany County penitentiary, he re-#
turned to Washington last December.' '
'Captain Howgate was known as a scien

.11 American school teachers which
I will go out to conquer the Philip-
Ji pines anew and more completely
sailed for Manila on the transport
Bherifian.
There Â¦were but forty-four of these
teachers â twenty- three men and twenty
one women. It had been reported that
203 were to take passage on the Sheridan.
That number of teachers have been
chosen. from the many applicants, but in
the majority of cases Colonel Long's tele
graphic notification to report for the voy
egÂ» was received too late, and but few
Â¦were able to prepare for the long trip and
longer sojourn In the tropics In so short
a time.
The young women and the men who
sailed yesterday faced the situation calm
ly end with fortitude. There was little
excitement among them, and neither the
exuberance of adventure nor the grief of
the sundering of home ties was much in
evidence. Every face among them was
grave with the hopeful earnestness of one
Â¦who goes out to a new land to perform a
duty and If possible to achieve things
worth while.
Many friends of the departing teachers
â¢were on the transport dock for hours
before the Sheridan sailed at noon â and
they were the ones who Ehed the tears
and grave voice to hysterical laughter.
They crowded the decks of the transport
until the warning gongs sounded, and
when they had all gone ashore serenity
reigned on the decks where the brave,
earnest girl teachers stood in groups.

AUSTRALIAN ; TTTRFMAN
ADMIRES OUR JOCKEYS
H. C. White Says That Johnnie Reiff
H. C. White, one of the most prominent
turfmen of Australia, ' arrived here yes
terday on the Sonoma. He is on his an
nual trip to England, where he attends
the summer race meetings. ' â¢ 'Â¦
He attracted much attention last year
in racing circles through winning the Liv
erpool cup, one of the most classic races
on the English turf, with Skopos. .
White is an enthusiast over American
racing methods, jockeys and trainers, j
"I think that American Jockeys can put
it all over all other riders," he said yes
terday. "Take Johnnie Relff, for instance.
There is, in my opinion, no rider like him
in the world. He rode my winner in the
Liverpool cup and won the race through
his clever riding. Before American jock
eys went over to England the boys that
had the mounts used to make an effort
Just before they came to the grand stand
and that was all. An American jockey
rides all the way. He goes to work from
the moment the horse leaves the post un
til he Is under the wire. I employ. Ameri
can jockeys and shall whenever I have a
horse to start." Â¦ '

Speedy Commando Makes a New Track
RACES ON EASTEBN TRACKS.
TIM HEGARTY, the Australian
champion boxer, .arrived yesterday
on thQ Oceanic steamship Sonoma.
He was met . at the wharf ' by
George Hartlng, his manager, and
after luncheon was taken round to the
various newspaper, offices. Hegarty is a
mild looking fellow five feet six Inches In
height. He weighs at the presents time
about 120 pounds but says he can easily
reduce to 126 pounds, the weight stipu
lated in the articles of agreement to fight !
McGovern. He has few of the earmarks
of a fighter. His face and hands" are
minus the scars of battle and the only
evidence that he might be a.- ringster is
his big shoulders ! and closely cropped
head. He boasts of never having received
a black eye. His hands are in splendid
shape and have never been strained or
broken. / Â¦>
Hegarty has fought more than 100 bat
tles and has never lost one. It is true
that "Crocker" Tweedie fought him a
twenty-round draw some months ago,,
but Hegarty easily explains this by saying
he fought the battle with eight-ounce
gloves and for the benefit of Tweedie, who
was in need of funds. He also says that
the rounds were two minutes in duration
and that at the time Tweedie was much
bigger than he was while In this country
and 4s besides a very shifty boxer,
Hegarty says that he has come over
here to box McGovern, and as he wishes
to give the Americans an Idea of his
prowess in the ring he wants ample time
for training. He says he can get into
prime condition in four weeks and unless
given that length of time refuses to go on
with the Brooklyn cyclone-.; He will train
for his coming bout ;at -jthe. Terminal.
Australian Billy Smith' will assist him in
his work and Harting will look after his
interests.
Hegarty is not a native Australian but
was born in Ireland in the vicinity of the
Lakes of Killarney. He went with his
parents to the Antipodes when a boy.
He is 26 "years of age and has been fight
ing seven years. Following is a partial
record of the fighter's struggles in the
ring.

ThÂ« bookmakers suffered intensely at
Oakland yesterday. Four favorites, and
Â¦well played ones at that, one second
choice and one much favored long shot
captured the purees and made the back
of the books *the 'standing- places for
strings of lucky ticket holders. That is
the reason why there was so much joy on
the 5 o'clock Oakland boatâ except among
those who carried the riveted bags.
Notwithstanding the good Bhowinpr of
Montallade on. Friday tbte chalkers of
fered 7 and 5 to 1 against him, making
The Fretter the favorite in the one mile
and a sixteenth race, the fifth on the card
and the best of the day from all racing
view points. Rio Shannon was taken to
the front by Stuart at the outset, Montal
lade, with Butler up, tacking on. Butler
kept him to it and going round the turn
worked into the first position, never los
ing It after that. The Fretter and Rio
Shannon were driven, out and a. Â»Hooe and
.exciting finish resulted. The owner of
.Montallade won a handsome bet on his
horse.
First Shot, the favorite at 5 to 2 at the
opening, but S to 1 when the horses went
to the post, won the first raco without
;any Btrain and effort. Summer and First
Bhot went down the back stretch to
gether, but at the turn First Shot pulled
. away and cut the wire a head in ad Â¦
of Goldfinder. who was ridden hard at the
finish and made the place. I Don't Know,
with Marty Bergen up, took the Bhow.
Quibo, a 3 to 5 favorite, with Bassinger
up. walked away from a field of six In the
second race, over the one mile and fifty
yard course. Senator Matts was beaten
out for the place by Darlene's spltndid
cprint on the stretch.
Bassinger, on Estado, the second choice,
by a driving finish beat out .Armado. the
8 to 5 favorite, a nose in the four-furlong
maiden two-year-old race. Armado led
until the paddock was reached, and then
the race was nip and tuck until the wire
Â¦was undergone.
Wardman, piloted by Guiterrez, was
breathed around the, ring in stage whis
pers to be the best and sturdiest ciaft on
the seas, and the ship sailed home nicely
for first money over the six-furlong
route in the fourth race. Carlonian and
Gaylon Brown held the right. of way until
the stretch, when Wardman, gaining
epeed all the time, finished two lengths
ahead of Gaylon at the wire. Illilouon
coming up from behind made the show.
Wardman was listed as 6 to 5 favorite
Racetto, favorite in the sixth race, beat
out Saul of Tarsus and Novia from the
paddock to the wire. Searchlight did all
the leading at the start, but went to
pieces when the finish came. Alexander,
who had the mount on Racetto, gave a
good exhibition of riding.

The child, since she was recovered from
Baxter, has been with friends of the Bu

that â¢ she will remain under her grand
father's control.
"Buford had threatened to kill me on
Bight," was Baxter's declaration, when
questioned concerning his unfriendly re
lations to his former wife's father.
OAKLAND, June 1.â William S. Bax
ter, who was charged with the abduction
of his daughter Marcellene, had his case
dismissed by lustice Quinn In the Police
Court to-day, upon the father's testimony
that he did' not know the child's grand
father, S. H. Buford'of Napa, had legal
ly adopted the little girl. - . . *
-Baxter also declared he did not even
know his wife Lad secured a divorce from*
him before her death. He had been trav
eling In the east for five years, under the
name of W. H. Dow. Baxter's explana
tion for assuming another name was that
he had been in correspondence with his
wife and she had desired to keep that

Smith's Probable Successor.
This startling ruling cf the committee
means that the Blue and Gold eleven will
open its season in August handicapped by
the loss of its captain and most brilliant
player. "I_ocomotive" Smith has played
l'or'three successive years in the Fame po
sition on the /California team and has
earned the reputation of being the great
est halfback the coast has ever produced.
In his freshman year he captained his
class team, which defeated Stanford 20 to
0. He played in the last three Thanks
giving games, assisting in no small de
gree to the 22-0 and SO-0 victories. At the
close of last year's season he was elected
to the football captaincy, the honor
which he must now resign in his senior
year. Smith is almost as well known as
a baseball player, having held the posi
tions of pitcher and catcher in his class
and college teams. On the track he has
shov.m remarkable ability ' with the
weights.
Smith is one of the most popular men
i.i college. He is a member of the Siirma
Nu Fraternity and is enrolled in a num
ber of honorary societies, including* the
Skull and Keys, Theta Nu Epsilon. The
Winged Helmet t and The Golden Bear.
"The committee is united. In the mat
ter, and Smith will be refused admission
in Augvst. We realize how much his loss
will cripple the team, but the* faculty reg
ulations must be enforced at all costs.
Otherwise we .might as well give up our
standards and conduct one course for
bonafide students and another for ath
letes. No, there can be no appeal from
the- decision of the committee. Smith will
rot* be allowed to return before the spring
term ax least."
Smith Will Be Rejected.
The members of the faculty committee
who have taken this action are Profes
sors George C. Edwards, Thomas R. Ba
con, William B. Clapp and Lorln M. Hunt.
Colonel George C. Edwards said to-day:
"Smith will not be allowed to re-enter
college next fall. His work in his studies
has not been up to the requirements and
his attitude in the matter has been far
from satisfactory. Last Christmas his=
record demanded our attention and we al
most decided to exclude him, but as he
was a valuable and much needed man in
athletics we concluded to give him an
other chance and passed him on proba
tion. He did not profit by the warning.
He has neglected his studies and shown
no inclination to catch up in his work.
Consequently, there is but cfcie course open
to us.

_____ captain of the University of Cal
ifornia football team for 1901. and
the greatest college halfback in the United
States, will be denied admission into the
university this fall. This is the 7 definite
and final ruling of the faculty athletic
committee, which has reported on the
standing of the famous player. The com
mittee finds that his scholarship has been
inferior. After giving him a warning and
putting him on probation for the last

an extreme expedient and he will be sus

ion for captain, seems to be his logical

This is the second time that a Univer
sity of California football team has been
crippled by the summary action of a fac
ulty committee on the scholarship of its
captain. In 1899 James' Whipple, captain
of the eleven, was forbidden to play in the
Thanksgiving intercollegiate game be
cause of his poor standing. He disobeyed
ihe injunction of the committee and was
promptly dismissed by the president, but
reinstated at the beginning of the follow
ing" term. ,.' â¢ '
The football season this year will begin
nearly a month earlier than usual on ac
count of the change In the date t>f tho In
tercollegiate game. ' Instead of being
played on Thanksgiving day the "big 1
same" will be played three weeks earlier,
on Saturday, November 9. This is In ac
cordance with the athletic agreement
drawn up between the two colleges, aimed
at the reform of some of the abuses in
Pacific Coast football and intended to
brlnp H more into harmony with Eastern
football.. .
At a meeting of football managers at
the Olympic Club last night, there were
present J. T. Nourse, Graduate .Treasurer
of Stanford; Reno H. Hutchlnson, Gradu
ate Manager of the University of Cali
fornia; George James, captain of the
Olympic Club; Irwln.J. Muma. manager
of the Olympic Club football eleven, and

The preliminary same? will be played Â¦!
on the college grounds at Berkeley and i
Palo Alto, and the deciding matches will
probably be held on the old F,->lsom

SACRAMENTO. June 1.â A storm is
raging about the ears of Rev. George E.
Dye, pastor of the Baptist church/ of.
Willows, Glenn County, and the : congre
gation has authorized an official investi
gation of the clergyman's conduct.: A
young widow # is declared to be the. cause
of the trouble. Rev. Mr. .Dye -is a mar
ried i man and his wife and | family- are
highly, respected 'by the people ;of Wil
Â¦ About six -weeks ago J: P. Klemmer, a
pioneer, hardware- merchant of -.Willows,
dropped dead in his pew Â¦ in â¢ the I Baptist
church while listening to - Rev. , Mr. Dye
preach a sermon.. Among those who were
foremost ! in expressing .their eympathy
for the bereaved family 'was the pastor,
and his funeral sermon was a touching
eulogy of .the dead and tribute to- the
worth of the widow. It Is said that the
minister has continued to pour out his
sympathies to the widow ever since the
burial of her husband. The minister's
honeyed words, say the gossips, did not
fall upon ears that were deaf, but went
Into a j heart which, yearned for sym
pathy... ; '
; Young Klemmer's .Expose.
The conduct of the minister soon- at
tracted public . attention and aroused
commentâ comment, however, .. that was
made in whispers at first, Now the scan
dal is fairly shouted out from the house
tops. The storm which had been gather
ing about the head of the minister for a
few weeks past broke last Saturday, at
which time there was a -tempestuous
scene at the residence of the widow.
Re^ George" E. Dye was there, having
beer summoned by the eldest son of the
dead merchant, L. J.' Klemmer, a stepson
of Mrs. Klemmer. He had sent them
word that he had something of much in
terest to tell them.
As the story is told at Willows. Mrs.
Klemmer went to San Francisco to wit
ness the demonstrations in honor of
President McKinley. Rev. Mr. Dye was
attracted by the same prospect and'fol
lowed the widow. Shortly after the re
turn of Mrs. Klemmer it was announced j
that a burglar had entered her house and
stolen a number of letters and other
articles of value. The authorities gained
no clue to the thefts, but by a coinci
dence the letters fell into the hands of
the widow's stepson. L. J. Klemmer. The
latter has exhibited the correspondence
to a number of prominent business men
in the town. The letters are addressed
to the widow by her pastor. Rev." Mr.
Dye
One of them begins: "To My Darling."
After asking her to excuse him for having ,
written in pencil, the writer gives the
startling information that . ' we are
watched," and that "my wife knows all.
She has the facts." . ,
In the letter the pastor refers to the
pleasant time they spent together in Oak
land, and saidthat while he was ntanulns
on the platform at the Sixteenth-street
station he co\ild not help but think of
"that bottle" i.> which reposed in ' the
bureau drawer. The letter closed witn re
marks about "orange blossoms" and
"sweetest perfume," and with "much
love from your Romeo."
â¢ At the interview with young Klemmer,
Rev. Mr. Dye told him in an3wer to a
question that the "bottle" which reposed
in the bureau drawer in Oakland con
tained nothing stronger than "pop."
; Story .Told by the Stepson. ; .
Young Klemmer, who has-worked -hard
all his life in his father's hardware store,
was naturally shocked when he learned
of the state of affairs. He was incensed
at what he considered the shame which
had been brought upon the family name.
In his highly disturbed frame of mind he
took the letters which had fallen into his
hands? and' sought the advice. of his
friends. One of the letters was that just
referred to and^ signed "Romeo." The
other was in the handwriting of Mrs.
Klemmer, but was not completed. â¢ . ; '
Young Klemmer gives this version of
the interview which he held at his step
mother's on the occasion referred to:
"When we met I told her that she had
better send her daughter out of the room,
as I only wanted to talk with herself and
the minister. She said that her daughter
was her confidant in all things, and that
she wanted her in ; the room; that she
had nothing to hide from her. I told her
that she would regret having let her re
main after hearing what I had to say. I
then told them \ of what I knew, and
about having . possession of the letters.
The announcement had a decidedly
crushing effect upon the two, and they
begged me to say nothing about the af
fair and not to show the letters.
"Some people have : taken occasion to
say that 1 took the means of holding the
letters over her head to force her into a
settlement of my father's estate. There is
absolutely no truth in that statement. I
made the settlement with her first, paying
In cash her demands as her share of the
estate, and it was not until the next-day
when we had the interview that I spoke
of having the letters."
The officers of the Baptist church have
been making an investigation of the scan
dal nnd have called a meeting of the
church members to discuss the trouble.^

SCANDAL CLOUDS
PASTOR'S NAME
Nebraskan Refers to the
Chief Executive as an
Emperor.
LIICCOLN. Neb.. June 1.â Taking for his
text The words "Emperor McKlnley"
"VY. J. Bryan to-night gave out an ex
tended statement bearing upon the Su
rireme Court decision in the insular cases.
Bryan frankly admits that the court's
verdict is extremely distasteful to him,
and the language he employs is more
vigorous than is customary even for him.
He boldly declares that the Supreme
Court has Joined hands with the President
end Congress In an effort to change our
form of government and he calls on the
people to repudiate the verdict. He says
in part:
By a vote of five to four the Supreme Court
has declared President McKlnley Emperor of
I'orto Rico, and according to the press dis
patches the Emperor hae gladly and grace
fuily accepted the title conferred upon him
by the highest Judicial tribunal of the land.
Those who were encouraged to' believe that
the constitution has caught up with the flag
â¢were doomed to disappointment. In the
Downes case, Â¦ decided immediately afterward.
Â«. majority of the court, composed of Justices
Brown, Gray. White, Shiras and McKenna,
held that Congress could deal with Porto Rico,
and the tame logic applies to the Philippines,
â¢without regard to the limitations of the con
stitution. Chief Justice Fuller and Associate
Justices Barlan, Peckham and Brewer dis
sented In strong and vigorous language, but
the opinion of the majorityâ even a majority
of oneâ stands until it Is reversed.
Censures the Supreme Court.
This la one of the most important decisions,
Â¦ If not the most Important, ever rendered by
: the court- It not only declares that Congress
is frreaier than the constitution which created
( It â the creature greater than the creator â but
'.It denies the necessity for a written constitu
' tion. The position taken by the court ie de
Â¦ fended, or rather excused, by reasoning which.
*lf followed out. will destroy constitutional lib
icrty In the United States. Every reason given
1 fcy Juetlce Brown could be used with even
'more force to support a decision nullifying
â¢ &11 limitations placed by the constitution ton
Â¦ Congress when dealing with the citizens of the
Â¦several States. If the Porto Ricans can^trust
the Â¦wisdom and Justice of a congress which
they do not elect and cannot remove, why do
fthe people of the United States need a con
stitution to protect them from a congress
'Â¦^rhlch they do elect and can remove? The
decision in eSect declares that the people are
not the eource cf power. It defends taxation
Â¦without representation. It assails the founda
tion of the republic and does so on the
' pround of expediency.
, The dissenting opinions bristle with prece
l r>nts end burn with patriotism. They ought
f< awaken conscientious Republicans to a re
Â¦elization of the meaning- of Imperialism. This
decision, l'.ke the Dred Scott decision, raises a
political i^sue which must be settled by the
people. The Supreme Court has Joined with
the President and Congress in an attempt to
Â« hanpe the form of our government, but
â¢shrre yet remains an appeal to the people.
In order to fully understand these opinions.
It must be known that in ruling that the
tariff rates could not prevail against
3'<->rtr> Rico, the cnurt did not act on the the
ory that the constitution followed the flag dur-
Ing any of these periods under consideration.
This ruling waÂ« made because, in the opinion
,,Â«â¢ thÂ«> court, a laxr enacted for the purpose of
levying tariff duties eg-alnst a foreign coun
try oould rot be applied in levying tariff duties
:j:air.st a country that was not "foreign."
Declares Eulings Are Unjust.
_?i otber words, if. immediately after the
ratifi<~atk>n of the pea^e treaty, Consjress hart
rnar-tp<1 a law levying- the Dintrley rates.
npwfatijr aÂ§rair.?t Por*o Rico, those rates j
vrui'V have prevailed. Ir> the court's opinion. !
th= lecra.li.ty of any tariff rate between Porto |
Kif-o and the United States simply iraited I
rnon a formal act of Congress establishing
tnrs* rates as applying to Porto Rico. The
lnfri<* of this opinion, as it applies to the right
â¢ Â¦f Â«Vrncrress to levy tariff customs, would
rr.ak*- It r>ossible for Congress to levy tariff
<Vjtie? r,n article? coming from any Territory
rf thÂ° Vnitcd States.
With rPEpect to our new posspsslone Uip fleci-
Fior. is Ln unfair nne, because i't denies to them
equal trade privileges with other portions of
the l"r'.".eft States whose sovereignty has been
e'pt&Wished over them, and the purpose of the,
Â»Â¦" r.stltution in providing for equal trade prlv- i
Slopes was that no section subject to the PnitecJ i
fHsitef? sovereignty ever become the victim j
of This principle is in line with !
the very foundation principles of this Govern- |
rnent which contemplates that all of the peo
ple of the T"rJte<J States should have equal
privilege, should be exempt from discrimina
tions end should enjoy the immunities which
Ilie cor.ftitution makers conceived to be essen
tial to the perpetuity ef free institutions.
After an extended summary of Justice !
reasoning Bryan continues:
TrrougTiovt the majority opinion delivered
bv Justice Brown runs the theory that the
American Congress may do anjihing not for
rudden in the constitution. This is one of the :
rocst repugnant features of this opinion. Jus- I
Â¦tlce Brown seems to have searched the constl
tutlon for prohibitions ratber than for that!
g-aat of rower wlileh the American people
have aiways conceived to be the true office. of
that instrument.
Bryan concludes as follows:
To v.hat a porous I* Id for inspection this
Tustiee cf the Supreme Court has invited the
.American people. Dude* this opinion we are
about to embark on Great Britain's colonial
r-ol'cy and. to reassure ourselves, to quiet our
conscience, we have tut to look at the history
of Great Britain toward its outlying posses
ftions E'.n<-e the American revolution. An In
miring; spectacle, indeed 1 . We may look at
F-uth Africa, where Great Britain s unre-
FTsiineu possession of power has destroyed two
promisirg republics &r.i has drenched the Foil
Wh blood of patriots: we may look at India,
Those people have been dying by starvation
f.,r vears: at India, wliere on several occasions
i fcÂ« bounty and generosity of the. American peo
i !e have been necessary in order to secure hu
rian' being* living under the eoverelgnty of
Oreat Britain from death by starvation.

The valuation of $3000 placed by the

the valuables Ellis paid the money lender
this sum.
The sale of the jewelry was advertised
for 10 o'clock. The presence ' of several

BERKELEY, June 1.â Mrs. Richard. A.
Danter. late proprietress of the Bonbon
niere candy store, has eloped with Byron
Morrow., a motorman recently employed
on the Telegraph-avemie electric line, who '
has been living until within a few days at
4901" Telegraph avenue. Mr. Danter, the
reputed husband of the woman,' has been
conducting, a confectionery store at 304A
O'Farrell street, San Francisco. He was
seen at his place of business to-day and
told the following story: -
"My wife has disappeared with this
man Morrow. I have traced them to Six
teenth-street station, Oakland, where
they took the Owl train last Monday even
ing for Los Angeles. I am glad she's
gone. She has troubled me long enough.
I have known all along about this man.
She met him a year ago in the O K candy
store; .which my wife and I conducted at
that time. Theyâ became very intimate,
and six months agq I got disgusted with"
the whole affair ana separated from her,
telling her she could go and live with
any one she wanted â¢ to. â¢ "We parted and
have had hardly anything to do with each
other, since. She has run away with Mor
row, but I do not intend to pursue them
or make any move In the matter."

avenue has lived near the Danters and
has known, the pair for .some time. Ha
said to-night: . Â¦
"I met Mr. Danter on the train last
"Wednesday afternoon. He told me his
wife had sold out and gone away with
her motorman. He was making: inquiries
for the destination of the couple at the
tinpe, telling me that the motorman's wife
had telegraphed him to do so. It seems
that Morrow had a -wife and family who
hail recently come from the Bast. Seeing
the situation here she had wanted to re
turn home; but Morrow had no money,
being out of work while convalescing
from a wound received in a recent shoot
ing scrape. Mrs. Danter gave him tha
funds and he sent his family back t3
Omaha. , Now. Morrow and Mrs. Danter
are bound . for Omaha also for reasons
which are intelligible to them alone.
"The Danters have never got along well
together. As a result of their quarrels
the O- K candy store was sold, Mr. Dan
ter opening a similar business in the city
and Mrs. Danter purchasing The Bon
bonniere'. in Berkeley. Mr. Danter hasr
been around to her place of business sev
eral times. On one occasion he met Mor
row there and the two men had an alter
cation, which resulted in blows. A week,
ago last "Wednesday Mrs. .Danter sold her
store and disappeared from Berkeley."
Morrow had . been a motorman on thai
San Pablo electric road for several years,
but on April 21 he was discharged Becausa
of his brutal assault upon Charles Jame
son, conductor of the car. Jameson shot
the motorman In the arm. Morrow was
arrested, and during his detention at thai
City Prison in Oakland Mrs. Danter sent
him a box of candy and sufficient money
for bis ball.
A peculiar circumstance surroundlngr
the sale of the "Bonbonniere" is the fact
that G. A. Eddy, the purchaser, says Mrs,
Danter signed the bill of sale as Margaret
Hopkins, which is supposed to be her
maiden name.

MIKES AND MIXING. .
Montezumaâ Copperâ Coalâ Coke.
Montezuma â Copperâ Coal â Coke. Â¦ -
Moutezuma â Copperâ Coal â Coke.
Monteiuma shares are bought by men (and
women) who have made money In oil, men
who have lost money in oil, and men who
will not touch oil; bought by men who .hold
other mining stocks, and by men who make
Montezuma their first Investment; bought by
the laboring man, the clerk, the tradesman,
the capitalistâ in short, by hundreds of peo-
ple, and all for the same reason â to make
moneyâ to invest a small sum of money now
in the hope and expectation that it will yield
an income that ordinarily comes from a con-
siderable investment. Mark well this state-
ment:- These Investors will Buffer no disap-
pointment: the profit of Judicious investment
will surely be theirs.
Some large sales of shares ,wera made by
us In May; other large sales are pending for
June. Bue we sell small lots as cheerfully
as large ones.
A letter from the copper mines (they are in
Washington, near Mount Rainier) gives de-
pendable news of the widening of the rich
vein in the "Tacoma" tunnel to 17 feet. Pho-
tographs Just received illustrate development
at both copper and coal mines. We'd like to
have you -see them; we want you to know
there are substantial reasons for advancing
the price of shares to 15c and 17c (the price
fixed for July). That means the Montezuma
Company think their 24 copper mines and 2000
acres of- coal lands "all under one roof* are
worth a million and a 'naif dollarsâ and they
are; every stroke of the pick, the passing of
every day, adds to their value.
Present prices of 12c cash or 14c on install-
ments will not hold long â possibly till July 1.
It behooves the man who wants to get in to
investigate this proposition now. Prospectus
and mart will help. .
Our excursion postponed until July 6. on ac-
count of snow at the mines. Learn something
of this delightful trip. Folder for the asking.

The stock market has shown more animation
and more consistent strength this week than
at any time since the commotion.-- of May 9.
Professional operators still form a large pro
portion of the dealings and there have been
many movements, especially In the industrial
list, that ' can only be explained on the score
of manipulation by pools. There was a feeling
In the street that the project of an adjustment
of the Northern Pacific dispute and of avoid
ance of further hostilities as an outgrowth
was coming to a settlement. The conviction
of this was strong before the official announce
ment, based upon a number of Inferences. The
arrival of Mr. Morgan in London from his
vacation fostered It, as his decision upon the
matter was essential in any event. So did the
fact that conferences were going on in this
city between the parties in interest. The up
ward movement in Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific is accepted as corroborative evidence.
The offer of the two banking .houses which
represent the contending interests to allow the
London shorts to settle. for the fixed price of
153 where they are "honestly unable to make
delivery," relieved somewhat the fears of fur
ther stock market disturbances growing out of
the difficulties of the shorts, but the wording
of the offer makes it clear that there was no
relaxation of the closeness with which the
rivals were exacting all possible deliveries of
actual certificates of the stock. The stock Is
also practically unprocurable In the market.
The fact was considered significant that the
list of collateral for the $100,000,000 Issues of
Union Pacific convertible bonds, given In the
application to the Stock Exchange to list those
"bonds did not include any Northern Pacific
etock. The Inference was that the stock was
thus designedly left -free to be disposed of In
any settlement of the dispute in the North
western Railway territory. A clause In the
mortgage, however, makes lt cletr that the
proceeds of the bond issue may be applied to
reimbursing the expense of the Northern Pa
cific purchases in the interest of the company.
In the meantime, the project, which is called
in Wall street "the Greater Missouri Pacific,"
has taken on greater distinctness of outline
and admittedly Includes a desire . and a pur
pose to secure control of a trunk line outlet
for the Gould-Rockefeller Southwestern system
to the Atlantic Both.the Erie and Lackawan
na seem from the market movement of ihelr
stocks, to be aimed at by this project. The
advance in this group of stocks under the buy-
Ing supposedly for this purpose has .had a
stimulating effect on other stocks. There has
been large buying of Atchison and a revival
of the rumor that this was for account of
Pennsylvania in retaliation for the Gould pro
ject. The disapproval of this project by the
great trunk line proprietors is taken for grant
ed. The interects thus brought into conflict
would be partly identical with those involved
In the Northern Pacific dispute. Suggestions
of friction along the same lines are found in
the rumors of Illinois Central's plans for enter
ing the Chlcago-St. Paul granger field through
the Minneapolis and St. Louis and the Iowa
Central, and the repoi t that a large purchase
of Ohio bituminous coal lands is supposed to
be for Gould account. Apparently the specula
tive traders have returned to their old inter
pretation of these developments as indicating
the extension of "community of interest" rath
er than the later Interpretation Induced by the
Northern Pacific Incident, of harmful rivalry
between the great railroad powers. The gen
erally favorable character of the April state
ments of net earnings and of the May gross
earnings was an influence on the -whole rail
road list. The continuing good prospects for
the cereal crops and reports of serious damage
to foreign crops had a strengthening Influence
on railroad stocks. Political considerations also
played a part. The continued ease of money
Indicated a growing accumulation of idle and
a prospect of increased efforts to find a fixture
for them. For this reason the export of gold
though unexpectedly heavy, was little regard
ed. The activity In thu railroad bond market
has been general in some of the speculative is
eues. which have generally advanced. United
States refunding 2a and the new 4a advanced
hi per cent over the closing- of last week.
NEW YORK. June 1.â The stock market
made an extraordinary response to-day to the
official announoen-.ent of the agreement ar
rived at by the conflicting interests in North
ern Pacific. Speculation seemed to leap to the
conclusion that the only impediment had been
thereby removed to the return to the level of
prices and the advancing tendency which was
interrupted by the devastating effects of the
corner in Northern Pacific. There was head
long buying of stocks all through the list on
a -buoyantly rising scale. All things were
made favorable for bullish enthusiasm and any
news which seemed to threaten values was ig
nored. The market took all the characteristics
of the recent boom period and after absorbing
all offerings to take profits rose vigorously
again In the final dealings to the highest of
the day, where U closed. There was no ex
ception to the action of the market, but some
of those stocks which have been advanced
sharply of late were kept steady by the offer
ings to realize profits. This was notably true
of some of the Southwestern and Southern
railroads. The early spurt was most sensation
al in Union' Pacific, the United States Steel
stocks and Atchison. The first sales of United
States Steel were of 30,000 shares. The rise
in Union Pacific extended to 3% during the
first hour. There was some reaction midway
of the session, but the grangers became con
spicuous, led by St. Paul, with a 9%-polnt rise.
Rock Island gained 6%, Northwestern 4% and
Great Northern preferred 44. There was still
a conspicuous absence of dealings in Ndrthern
Pacific, not a single transaction being recorded
either for the common or preferred; Not even
a bid and asked was recorded for the common
stock at the closing. The details of the North
ern Pacific agreement are not announced and
rumors were numerous pointing to wide-reach
ing adjustments all through the railroad world
as coro:iaries of the Northern Pacific â¢ settle
ment. The whole Northwestern railroad sys
tem, lt was said, would come into one harmoni
ous control and representations of the same
control would be found in the Union Pacific
system. The Union Pacific, said, the gossips,
wouM detach the Southern- Pacific,' for the
the benefit of a Pacific outlet for the Gould
Southwestern system and content itself with
the Central Pacific. Tins operator who was re
garded as the market dealer during the recent
boom was very conspicuous in the day's deal
ings and bought thousands of shares of many
different stocks all- around the room. The
bulls declared that great financial powers had
entrusted -large resource* to the direction of
this operator to inaugurate a new bull move
ment. The gains in the prominent stocks run
from 1 to 3 points or over. There was an enor
mous absorption of Union Pacific convertible
bonds, as well as of the stocft.

SAN FRANCISCO. June 1â6 p. m.
The following maximum temperatures were
reported from stations in California to-day:
'There has been unusual activity on the part
of timber purchasere In the different lumber
belts of the coast. Redwood lands have right
fully attracted a considerable amount of this
interest and several large sales have been re
corded In the redwood rone. The exhaustion
of the available lands in the southern part of
the Union and the districts of the Northwest
or their purchase by large eyndicates for spec
ulative purposes has rendered It necessary for
the Eastern lumber manufacturers to come
West, and the result is to be found In the
purchase of the timber lands on this coast and
the enthusiasm of the new owners. Without a
doubt many of the purchasers -will not think
of entering the manufacturing field for some
years to come, although some ere now making
preat 6trides and will probably revolutionize
the manufacturing and business end of the
lumber trade of the Pacific Coast. Other than
this there was little to attract notice during
the month," Â¦
The Pacific Coart Wood and Iron says of
J umber:
"There has been but little If any Improve
ment noticeable during the last thirty-one
days and the prospects for any in the month
Just opening are not very encouraging. Prices
have remained as they have been for some
months and there Is no Indication of an ad
vance for some time to come. This is true of
all the lumber sold in this city and along the
entire coast. Shingles of the redwood species
remain stationary as to market quotations, but
most active as to demand, both from the local
and Eastern markets. The activity shown in
placing the merits of these great shingles be
lore the Eastern users is now bearing fruit
and the orders are far more plentiful and fre
quent than for any spring for years -past. All
considered, there Is no reason for complaint on
the part of the manufacturers of the redwood
ehlngle. but plenty for all kinds of grumbling
from the lumber dealers and mills of the red
wood, pine, spruce and fir fields of the West.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
WASHINGTON, June L-JTo-day's statement
of the Treasury, balances . In the general fund.
Condition of [the Treasury.
Surplus. $21,253,050; decrease. $35,925.
The Financier says: The condition of New
York associated banks, according to their cur
rent statement, does not differ materially In
the matter of surplus reserve from the exhibit
of a week ago. The excess reserve declined
only $35,925. although the operations by which
this result was attained, were quite heavy.
Loans expanded $7,442,100, reflecting : probably
business which properly should have been In
cluded In the statement of a week ago and
this expansion, together ' with the increase I of
12,264,400 in cash, accounts for the, rite, to
$11,281,300 in deposits. This latter necessitated
an. additional reserve requirement, wuich as
noted, counteracted almost exactly the cash
gain and left , the surplus Intact. The cahh
Item, however, does not afford an accurate re
flection of the real position of the banks â¢ since
the $4,000,000 of gold exports on Thursday v do
not .count -except fractionally ' In tho bank
totals of 'Saturday. As a matter of fact, the
banks gained , several million dollara from the
Interior during the week, and lost approximate
ly what they rained in- the subtreasury. The
statement must be regarded, therefore,' as very
favorable in its" conclusions. Â¦ The gold' exports
of the week created no change in the situation
and the outlook remains practically, the same.
There Is nothing on which to base predictions
of material changes ,ln the 'money market.
Bankers seem to anticipate a season of quiet
ness for the present, and there is " nothing in
special ' reports from other important financial
centers to lead to a different conclusion r> It
is possible that gold exports will continue ' In
termittently, â¢ but against these' shipments,* â¢ If
made, there will be receipts from Alaska and
elsewhere. -The heavier purchases of bonds by
the treasury Is realizing some money, but as
the reduction , in war . taxes roes Into ; effect
July 1 the continuance of bond buylr.r is" an
uncertain factor. The statement of the coming
week may show the ' effects of June dividend
disbursements now , being made. - . - : Â»

JAPANESE LABOR
CAUSE OF WORRY
-."The subject of Oriental ;* Immigratio-n -is
worthy ; of the most serious consideration by
the American people, and wh'lle'we are thor
oughly acquainted with ' the fact that the
question has been fully discussed and settled
in the minds of the publ lc, * and while we en
tertain the fullest confidence in the ability of
the present- administration : and the.;willing
ness of Congress to re-enact . a Chinese exclu
sion law, when the Geary act shall have ex
pired, we nevertheless â¢ find cause 'â¢ for - this
memorial. . ,--v '.Â¦.-., â¢ <
The Japanese immigration - has assumed a
most alarming irropcrtlon, 1 - and ' It; it Is not
checked in - time will work irreparable injury
to nil the States on the Pacific . Coast. Â¦ Â«
Â¦ Our objection to "; Japanese .. labor is - tha
same as that which has been advanced against
all coolie labor: it is based on the soundest of
economic principlesâ the law - that the - pro
duccr's standard -of living, determines the in
crease of a people andv consequently the com
fort or misery of the. laboring: class. ->â¢ The most
striking ; thing : about Â¦â¢ the - Oriental people is
their fecundity.- In nearly all those countries
the ; Increase of population is limited- only by
the : supply of bread. .' A ; few , years ago Japan,
with little -foreign trade and subsisting, of
her. own soil," supported = 44,000.000 of people on
a. territory j not \ larger ' than the Â¦ State of Cali
ifornia, - and ? only- one-tenth â¢ of { which ( is [ ar
able. The . expansion of ;â¢ population ' down to
the .' barest food minimum - digs - the abyss of
famine underneath millions of human beings,
and (but â¢ one Â¦ crop ' failure precipitates . niyrlada
of , Hindoos : Into t this abyss. -^ The - only Â¦ thing
that -can avert 'such disasters is ' a - standard of
living' that Includes . something besides bread.
-Â¦But the root of our objection to the Japanese
Immigration : is - out exposure v to ; competition
with- a. cheap man. â¢ The coolies cannot outdo
the -'.white â¢ mechanic and - laboring man. . but
he: can underlive :hlm. â¢ He cannot r. produce
more,' ; but he c?.n consume less. v ' '.*- ''â¢-%: Â¦
. ' Everything ws call i progress has ; helped I to
develop '. a ~ man, '. who " can â¢- produce / much and
who | can ; consume * much, â¢ and i If has . abhorred
the cheap man. High wages and prosperity to
the American' people go together; but,; in I ord*r
to guard Â¦ thia well the 'American^laborer .-must
nave protection against ; the cheaper : manâ or
else we will ; soon find , that ] one . American boy
has been replaced by three Orientals.
Therefore/. Mr. President, do your, memor
ialists respectfully request that you will *iva
this question your earnest and profound con,*
sideration, which we trust and pray mar re
sult to the common good of all the citizens oÂ£
the -great American nation.

If *.he had- caught the : murderer. When
answered in the negative, the child com

tearfully pleaded, stroking the officer's

would not have gone there, and' perhaps

All the policemen in the city were yes
terday ordered by their superior ; officers
to visit all the houses oh their respective

missing. The persons . reporting the
loss of : hatchets will be - taken to- po
lice headquarters and shown the one
found in- the lot near the Hislop resi
dence on - the morning of ; the V murder.
By these means Captain Seymour hopes
to clear up the mystery surrounding the
ownership of the bloody, weapon. In ad
dition to trying to, find an owner for! the
hatchet,. the head of the detective depart
ment has a number of men engaged ln
getting: a trace of the pin -stolen from the
Hislop residence Â« by the assassin. It l is
on ordinary gold pin and is worth very
little. Captain Seymour is inclined. to be
lieve that the . murderer, finding, that the
pin was almost valueless, threw it away
after " leaving the house, â¢ rather "than . to
run the risk incldentto disposing of lt.>'
As far as the Hislops know the pin was
the only article stolen from the house.
