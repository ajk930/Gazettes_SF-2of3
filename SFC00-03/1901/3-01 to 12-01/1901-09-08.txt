refused to listen "ton's 'pleadings. '.
Then - followed .a tempestuous scene.
Den Luis called i:pon " the saints in

him win the consent of Ysabella.
"You shall be my wife." ha threatened,
"or by the mother who bore, me an
other sun shall not look upon theÂ«."
"I am content," she replied. "I would
rather never boo this gloomy world
â¢gain than 'see ycu a part of It."
She . had made her choice- Don Luis
put her in the dungeon underneath tha
house. With nothing to console her save
her faith here she passed a yeur of tor
ture. She could hear the mission church
bell ring, and saw in the blackness the
picture of the -little procession tilt: in and
. out of the church.
â¢ She could nlso hear the bugle calls at
the garrison and see the well-known pic
ture of the change of guards illuminate
the' blackness.
All the while Don Luis continued to,
live In his brother's house. Terrible tales
cf the crimes he committed are still ex
tant. In r fact, at. all the missions and
ranthos in Alta und Baja California the
r.f.me of Luis Garcia was feared and
despised. . .
One day a troupe of wandering mlnstrel3
stopped at the Miss!on Dolores. Don Luis
"hirer! them to make merry the night,
ilcssensrers were sent to invite all the
gentlemen of the neighborhood. They
came readily, for Don Luis had made a
reputation among them as a liberaf and
reckless entertainer.
In the nilrtst of the revelry, when the
mirth was hign. Don Luis silenced the
mueic and announced to his guests that
he had a more dramatic entertainment
for them. He Â«nt word to a priest at the
nlssicn to comeâ and to come prepared to
unltu him to YÂ«ahel. Another messenger
was sent belov/ to bring up the unhappy
woman.-
The priest v entered tan spacious room

Ysabel. her beauty faded and her form

plete silence' fell upon the noisy company
when she entered. Not a man present but
felt that he was ; about to witness the
txecution-of Â«i .woman's soul.
' Luis - was i the first j to . speak. ".Priest."

â¢Ysabella and me? Speak quickly, cr by
Â«the Apostle Paul you shall never utter

â¢ For' answer the ' priest produced .the
books and: looked the pleading he dared
; 'not. speak. .-.*;" ;
j Don Luis thundered 5 . Impatiently,
"Marry us, then!"
'Â¦Â¦ Still the priest hesitated.
"If thou refuseat." roared Luis, "by St.
John, to-morrow's eun shall see your head
adorning the spire of this house!".
Then Luis turned to Ysabel.a and said:
When Don Luis sawÂ»nls . brother before
him he tried to escape. But he was cap
tured. The next ' morning; he was be
hc&ued and his body buried in unconse
craled ground, while his head was placed

up when one stirs the ashes and ember*,
so did the heart of Ysahrlla leap up at
the speech of Don Luisi The blood In her
veins turned to fire :' and kindled her

Turning to the minstrels and company
she cried: "Many loyal, subjects of our

THERE still lies buried beneath
this cobble-stoned, wooden city the
traces at the romance?, the psetry.
the loves and tragedies of that ear
lier, gentler, simpler, Latin 'race
which dwelt in peace and happiness here
in San'-FTaricireo before the deluge of
strenuous, English-speaking gold-seekers
burst like a torrent over the land.
Who does not know the" heart-breaking
romance of Ramona of Santa Barbara,
the picturesque legends of the pirates of
Lower California? But you metropolitans,
leaving the ferry building and walking up
Market street with your eye on the clock,
think San Francisco has known no
pastâ that Its history dates from "the
time when the water came up to Mont
gomery street'" V
Here In this little hamlet, which was
then called Yerba Buena, x far from the
troubled, . tireless Hast, red blood flowed
In men's veins like fireâ women's eyes
flashed, hearts sang and the tune of life
went on eayly as a Spanish jotcr.
There were not always saloons and tene
ment flats in the S'issicn. The Ca3tro-
Etreet car was not to come for decades.
The Valencia-street station "was yet un
born.
In those days, when California was a
province cf Spain. Captain Jose Maria
Garcia, majordomo of Mission 'Dolores.'
married Ysabella. daughter of Sergeant
Ortega of the Presidio. HÂ« built for his
bride the large adobe house which after
ward became known as "La Cabeza de
Toro," or bull's head.
This relic of the past was still standing
when, in 1S90, Just 100 years after its erec
tion, the widening of . Sixteenth street,
from Dolores to Church, made it neces
sary to raze it to the ground. But Its his
tory remains.
-On rainy nights tvhe-n the descendants of

A ROMANCE
OF
MISSION
DOLORESTHE SUNDAY CALL.
IT is a question whether the Irish are
"not, after the Spanish, the real pio
neers of California.
Certain it Is that plenty of them
came here before gringo timeâ in the
days when California was a. Mexican land,
from chlli-con-carne to fandango. They
came even before the days when gold was
plenty in the landâ when. theyhad to farm
their money, not dig- it. 'It . is a .slower
way to take it out of the soil by dint of
plowing and sowing, reaping and mow
ing, than to lay bare a nugget by the
stroke of a pick. But the Irish are a race
who understand the art of waiting.
Whaling ships came to this coast in
early days, long before gold was thought
of. and Irishmen constituted many gf the.
crews. There were American vessels sent
here not very long after the Revolution.
A good many of the sailors deserted and
settled in this State.
Captain J. Smith of .Kings County, Ire
land, was the first one known to make the
trip overland. He reached here in 1S2(5,
having come with a party of trappers.
His party of forty men were nearly all
V : ' *?
murdered. by the Indians. He escaped at
that time, reached here safely and went
inta the fur business. Two years later he
wae murdered by Indians in another mas
sacre. . Â¦ *Â»
Many of the Irishmen who came here in
early years did not preserve their nation
ality. They married senorltas", who were
a more thrifty lot than they are common
y considered. The senoritas recognized
he. fact that Irishmen were better pro
niders than the guitar-twanging gentle
men whom they had been reared with.
But they taught the Irish pioneers Mexi
can ways and so defeated their own ends.
Â¦ A few remained thoroughly Irish. One
of these was John J. Reed.
He reached here in 1826 and settled in
Marin County. He was the first English
speaking resident of that county, by the
way. His grant of land, one and a half
]paguÂ»F, came from Governor Figueroa in
the year 1834. He built the first mill over
there. He took the first soundings of the
bay hereabouts. He established the Sau
salito ferry-boats. He did fancy farming.
John Reed married a senorita himself.
Hilarita Sanchez, but he remained an
Irishman for all that. His daughters
were given the names of their mother's
race. Hilarita and Inez; the sons were
named by their father's choice, John and
Richard. , .
Timoth.y Murphy, who came here in 1S28,
ras given the name of Don Timoteo Mur
phy, and this strange mixture clung to
him in life and death. He devoted him
self largely to commerce. - ;.â¢ Â¦
James W. Burke, a sea captain, came
from Lima in tne year 1830. He settled in
Santa Barbara and lived there until 1S77.
These were a few of the forerunners. By
the time that actual' pioneer days had ar
rived, that is the days of '49. the Irishmen
were flocking here. As farmers and min
ers they made money.
The Murphy party was one of the
earliest and most successful. Martin.
Murphy left Ireland, his "unhappy coun
try," and settled in Canada, but, dissatis
fied there, he formed a party of family
and friends. and emigated to Missouri.
Irish Grove was the name of the prosper
ous settlement they formed there. The
Sullivans, Enrishts. v Corcorans, Jordan?,
"Walshes and AVhites were some of those
who?e. names were known later to Cali
fornia.
Nothing would have brought them here
if the i fevers of the Missouri region had
not driven them out. The death of . Mrs.
Murphy prompted her huehand : to take
his family away. A Catholic missionary
who visited the colony told him of Cali
fornia and be set out for the' Pacific
Coast.
Disposing of his lands, he procured the
outfit required for so long and dangerous
a journey, and bearing with him a pass
port from Governor Reynolds assuring
him and his the protection due American
citizens he started in May, 1S44. . The
parly reached here' in November of the
bame year, being the first tlutft succeeded
in bringing its wagons into California.
The little group, which included no end
of Murphys, several Sullivans, a Durbin
and some Martins, was under ' the guid
ance of Captain â¢ Stephens. "Captain
Stephens was a native of North Carolina,
a trapper for twenty-eight years and ac
customed to frontier life. . He had no trail
to guide him across the plains, and start
ed without even a pocket compass, but no
train that traversed the continent to the
Pacific was more blessed, freer frqm dis
aster or so. safe from savage attacks."
After a number of changes the Murphy
family finally settled in the Santa Clara
Valley', making a permanent* home there.
Martin Murphy bought Mexican, ranches
and made them yield as the ha'ppy-go
/ Â¦..-...
lucky Mexicans had never dreamed of.
doing:.
Some of the most famous fortunes mads
in the mines were made by Irishmen.
James Fair was a forty-niner whose
Â¦wealth is known the country over. He
was a native of Closher, Tyrone, Ireland,
whither he emigrated to Illinois, thence
to California via Oregon. The Bonanza
mines were the origin of his fortune, the
income from which was said to be $540,000
a month.
Thomas Tobin was another forty-niner,
a Tipperary man, who left Ireland with
his parents wben he was a youngster.
His schooling was received in Philadel
phia, and he started out In commercial
life therei . Afterward when he came to
San Francisco . he continue^ along the
fame line. He did business for a while
in Downieville, where he came out a pros
perous man after others had .been ruined
by fire. Under his capvas store he had
made a vault to store his goods in, for he
had a long-headed idea that fire would
make very easy prey of a town of can
vas. With all his goods in the vault it
was easy enough to come out of the fire
in a prosperous condition. Thomas Tobln
brought his Irish shrewdness to America.
Edward J. C. Kewen, although not an
Irishman by birth, was a son of an Irish
man, Captain Kewen. He was a student,
but there was too great a restlessness in
his nature to permit him to devote his
life to quiet studies. He liked to live. He
traveled, fell in love, married in Sacra
mento/ It was uncertain what he would
settle down to. Fate decided the matter.
He had a talent at oratory, and being
accidentally summoned to the rostrum
on the day of- his arrival at Sacramento,
he made a hit and the upshot was that
he was elected Attorney General by the
State Legislature.
He was an orieinal sort of man. His
biographer writes that "if other, evidences
of .moral and physical courage were
wanting, his character in this respect wai
especially manifest in â¢ his enlistment
against the squatter.", who at that early*
period of our history had banded in mur
derous clans. Under threats of assassina
tion he boldly repaired to one of theif
convocations on the' Levee and succeeded
by the audacity of his tongue in dispera*
ing the threatening crowd."
James Phelan wap an Irishman by
birth, being a native of Grantstown,
Queens County. . lie came here from New
York, sending on three different vesselj
a neat little stock of hardware, glass
ware, liquors, tobacco and beans. HÂ«
trusted that the sale of these would bo
profitable In a remote mining town.
The beans and the tobacco set him up
In business. Â¦
From them -he progressed to a great
commercial business. He dealt in im
ported liquors, he dealt in every other
kind of merchandise besides. He came Iv
time to establish a bank. It was the first
gold bank in California and the second
in the United States.
D. O. McCarthy has an Irish lineage to
reckon with. He was born to the McCar
thy More family, or Great of Muskerry,
renowned in the history of old Ireland as
being ancient princes of that large prov
ince. MkcCartha is the real spelling of
the name.
D. O. McCarthy, the California pioneer/
was named for Daniel O'Connor, the great
Irish patriot, who was a friend of the sen*
io'r McCarthy.
His coming to California was more roÂ»
mantle than that of any other pioneer. He
was a boy of only seventeen when he or
ganized a company of young men to emi
grate here; he -established himself their
captain, interpreter and commissary gen
eral and conducted them here safely by
way of Mexico, traveling on horseback
more than 2000 miles.
Bellew McManus was famed along *
very different line from any of these. He
was a martyr and patriot. He came here
from the Australian penal colonies and
found a peaceful life after the long years
of trials that he had endured for his na
tive land.
Colonel Hayes was a 49-er of whom a
most unfortunate love story is told by
some old settlers. It is said that Frank
McCoppin,- young and bumptious and
handsome, worked for Hayes on his
place. McCoppin- had come here -as a
yoxirig emigrant and. started work in a
humble capacity for Colonel Hayes. -
-He showed himself so clever and- so
trustworthy that he was rapidly ad
vanced, and he became so confidential a
friend of the old Colonel that he was
asked finally to do his wooing for him.
The Colonel was enamored of Miss Van
Ness. He didn't know how to go about
the matter for himself. He wanted Frank
to help him out.
Frank v undertook the commission and it
was a case of Priscilla over again. Miss
Van Ness fell in love with the ambassador
and married him while poor Hayes was
left in the lurch.
The old residents can string tales like ''
this when they grow reminiscent.' Per
haps the list of names given be-low fre
produced from the Nation) may call to
mind many another and make old times
new times for the passing hour.

In order to justify and explain, the title of my story, I would say
that it seems tome almost certain' that in that great future which is to
witness tho breakdown of so many barriers dividing man from man
and man from God, and in the new, methods', of settling internal and
international disputes, which will take the place of the brutal and bar*
barous conflicts; of : war, as well as the cruel and fratricidal struggles of
trade, the old Mother City of the Pagan and the Christian worlds will
have her rightful rank. Her geographical position, her -religious and
historical interest, her. artistic charm, and, above all, the mystery of
eternal life which attaches to her, seem to me ; to point to- Borne as the
seat of the great. court of appeal in the congress of humanity which (a3
surely as the sun will riss to-morrow) the future will see established.

me at once make confession of the limitation of the vehicle in my hands;

above everything: else I should tell. a simple human story.

Hall Caine' s Latest
and Best Work
"The Eternal City"
FOR about three years Hall Calne
has been hard at work in Rome col
lecting material and writing the
greatest of all his books, "The
Eternal City," just published by D. Ap
pleton & Co. of New York.
His time has not been wasted for "The
Eternal City" win*-- compare - favorably
with the greatest works In fictiori,of many
seasons. Mr. Caine has written, with a
purpose and what he has to eay\regard
ing the problem of his novel is printed on
this page but the book will appeal to the
preat mass of readers for its story alone.
In fact his writing is so powerfully hu
man in its Interest that probably not one
in a thousand will think of "problems
or "purposes" when devouring the pages
of "The Eternal CityÂ»'V
Like other books from Mr. Calne's pen
this is decidedly somber in color, almost
morbid; in fact, and as far as the charac
ters are concerned things could not turn
out much worse. The reader has the
rather 'poor consolation of knowing that
right for the multitude has come out of
the wrongs of individuals, but It is hard
to cheer for the grood of mankind at. large
with a Jump in your throat and tears in
your eyes over the cruel fates of- those
you have learned to know and loveâ even
if they are only passing figures in fiction.
This new novel is over .300.000 words In
length. From that fact alone it is evi
dent that the author has allowed himself
r.o limit In making his descriptions full
or in carrying out the Intricacies of his
plots and counterplots. The work is dar
ing and undoubtedly will awaken con-
Fiderable comment. It deals with the
Rome of to-day OKto-morrovr.
It is easy to imagine characters in the
book taken from those in real life, for
Mr. Caine does^not. hesitate to introduce
most prominently, a Pope of Rome, a
King and for his villain a most remark
able Prime Minister, and in lesser light
appear the British and American Minis
ters.
In a brief prologue is shown. a glimpse
of life twenty years before the actual be
ginning of the events that form the main
6tory.
Dr. Roselli, an exile from Italy living
under an assumed name, saves â¢ tho
lÂ«fe of a poor -little Italian sufferer
of the padrone system in Londonâ a little
chap who only knows that his name Is
David Leone, that he is from Italy and
that he is a beggar.
David lives with the Rosellis and be
comes as a brother to Roma, the daughter,
and also a firm believer in the doctor's
idea? for saving his country from the po
litical oppression that threatens it.
Twenty years later we. find that the doc
tor finally went to Italy on the false rep
resentations of his kinsman. He even left
his motherless little daughter in London
that he might further the good of the
cause for mankind. This kinsman, the
Baron Bonelli, easily compasses the
downfall of the gt>od doctor and manages
his life imprisonmentâ all because he
wishes the estates and is politically am
bitious.
Before the doctor dies he sends a phono
frraph cylinder to David, and this proves
of the utmost Importance as the plot de
velops. ;
Meantime Roma Roselli has been taken
by the Baron and brought up as his ward.
She is In Rome and Is known by her true
name of Roma Volonna. David Leone is
also In Rome, and now, under his moth
er's name of Rossi, is a member, of the
Chamber of Deputies and a leader of the
extreme Left He is regarded by the Gov
ernment as an anarchist of the most-dan
gerous eort, but in reality is a man of
peace and a believer in a government of
the people ruled by the people.
At the time of the Pope's Jubilee, when
Rossi addresses the people, neither Roma
.nor David has any idea of the identity
of the other. Already Roma's name has
been scandalously linked with that of the
Baron, and so in his speech directed at
the Government and its real head, the
.Prime Minister, Rossi uses that point to
eay:
"And who In Rome cannot point to the
Ministers who allow their mistresses to
meddle in public affairs and enrich them
selves by the ruin of all around?"
Baron Bonelli has the man promptly ar
rested on pretense of exciting a riot, but
Roma asks that he be left to her that she
may take | her own revenge. . She wishes
to humiliate him by becoming- his friend
and then betraying him after she has
finally wormed all of his secrets out of
him and can catch him in some con
spiracy of importance. To this end she
says to the Baron:
"You say there is a mystery about Da
vid Rossi, and you want to know who he
Is. who his father was and where he
spent the years he was away from
Rome."
"I would certainly give a good deal to
know it."
"You want to know what vile refugee
in London filled him with hjs fancies,
what conspiracies he Is hatching, what
secret societies he belongs to, and, above
all. what his plans and schemes are. and
whether he Is in league with the."Vati
can." â¢ . 4
She spoke so rapidly that the words
sputtered out of her quivering lips.
"Well?" . .
"Well. I will find lit all out for you."
"My dear Romai"
"Leave him to me. and within a month
you shall know"â she laughed,, a little
ashamedâ "the Inmost secrets "of his
soul." .'-* - . Â¦ .
She was walking to and fro again to
prevent the Baron from looking into her
face, which was now red over its white,
like a rose moon in a stormy sky.
The Barcn thought. "She is going to
humble the man by her charmsâ to draw
him on and then fling him away; and
thus pay him back for what he has done
to-day. So much the better for me ii
I may stano" by and do nothing. A
strong Minister should be unmoved by
personal attacks. He should appear tc
regard them with contempt." .
He looked at her, and the brllHancj
of -her eyes set his heart on fire. " ThÂ«
terrible attraction cf her face at
moment stirred in him the" only love hÂ«
had for her. At the same time it awak
ened the first spasm of Jealousy/
"I understand you, Roma," . he said
"You. are splendid! You are Irresistible
But rememberâ the man is one of the In
corruptible."
She laughed.; ' '- . .

it is the pride of all -such- men that .nt
Â¦woman ever can." ; \
"I've seen him," she said.
"Take care! As you say, he Is yount
' and handsome." . â¢
She tossed her head and laughed again
The. Baron thought: "Certainly . h<
has wounded her in a way no- womai
can forgive." â¢ * â¢ " *"â¢â¢:<:-. . . " !
"You wish me to liberate David Ross
and leave you to deal with him?"
"I do!" Oh, for the day when I cai
turn the laugh against, him as he turnec
the laugh against me! At the top of hi:
hopes, at the height of. his ambition
at the moment when he says to himself
'It Is done' â he shall fall." Â¦ Â¦; - â¢ â¢
The Baron touched the bell. "Ver;
well!" he said. "One can sometime
catch more flies with a spoonful of hone;
than with a hogshead of vinegar." W
Ehall see. - Â¦ '."
Roma at once proceeds to carry out he
- plan. She is a sculptress and decides t
&pW Rot-si to sit for her as a model fo
one of the figures on a fountain that s..
is doing for the municipality. . This ls.to^
be the first strand 5n the net with whlc.i
she Intends, to drown fcim.
In the meantime Rossi has learned"
something about Donna Roma and hl3
fears, are confirmed when he hears th<3
phonographic cylinder which has reached*.

gvardian of his ..youth: So his course is
tapi!y takeq when Roma calls.
"I am.-doing a very vnusual thins In
coming to see you,' she said, "but -yoÂ«Â».
have forced me to it, and I am quite
helpless.
""I heard your speech," in the piazza this,
noning. It would be useless to "disguise
the fact that some of its references were
meant fqr me. -
"If I were a man, I suppose I shouM
challenge you. . Being-' a' woman, I'can

are wrong-." â¢ .
"Wrong?"
"Cruelly, terribly, shamefully wrong."
"You mean to tell me"â
He was stammering In a husky voice,
but she said -Quite calmly:
"I mean, to tell you that In substance
ar.J In fact what you Implied was false." '
"Ifâ if"â his voice was thick and indis
tinctâ"if you tell me that I have dono
you an Injury" ?
."You haveâ a terrible Injury.
She could hear his breathing but she
flared, not j look up. lest he shoiild *eo
sonietning in her face.
"Perhaps, you think It strange,"^ she
raid, "that I should ask you to accept my
assurance only. But though you have done
me a great wrong- I believe you will ac â¢
ccct It. Kven your enemies speak of you

She niised her head, looked him full In
the face, p.nd without a quiver In her
vnice:
"I <1o irivc it." she said.
"Tlien I do believe you," he answered.
"With all my heart and soul I believe

"This man is a chid," she thought. "Hu

tlien she tlrTpped her eyes again, and
turning with her tli'.mb an opal ring on
her finger, she began to use the blandish
ments Which had never failed witn other
ir.cn.
"I do not say that I am altogether with

"I honor you for that," she said. "And
perhaps If. I had earlier met a man like
you my life might have been different. I
used to hope for such things long agoâ
that a man of high aims and noble pur
poses would come to meet me at the gate
of life. Perhaps you have felt like, that â
that some woman, strong and true, would
stand beside* you for good or for ill, in
your hour of danger and your hour of
joy."
Her voice was not quite steadyâ she
hardly knew why.
"A dream! We all have our dreams,"
he said. -
< "A dream indeed! Men cameâ he was
hot among them. They pampered every
wish. Indulged every folly, loaded me
with luxuries, but my dream was dis
pelled. I respected few of them and rev
erenced none. They were my pastime,
my playthings. And they have revenged
themselves by saying In secret â what you
said in public! this morning."
He was looking at her constantly with
h's great wistful eyes, the eyes of a child,
and through all the joy of her success
she was conscious of a spasm of pain at
the expression of his sad face and the
sound of -his tremulous voice.
"We men are much to blame, 1 ' he said.
"In the battle of man with man ,we deal
out blows, and think we are fighting fair,
but we forget .that behind our foe there
is often a womanâ a. wife,- a mother, a sis
ter, a friendâ and, God forgive us, we
have struck her, too." _
The half pmile that had gleamed on
Roma's throat was wiped 'out of it by
these words, and an emotion she did, riot
understand began to surge in her throat..
""' "You speak of poor women who strug
gle and starve." she said. "Would it sur
prise you to hear that I know what it. is
to do that? Yes, and to be friendless and
aloneâ quite, quite- alone in a cruel and
wicked city?" " . Â¦
She had lost herself for a moment, and
the dry glitter, in her eyes had given way
to a'molstness and a solemn expression.
But at the next instant she had regained
her self-control, and went on speaking to
avoid a painful silence. Â¦.
"I have never spoken of "this to another
man," she said. "I don't, know, why I
should mention It- to youâ to you .oÂ£ all
men." '-. S
He found no treachery In her fascina
tions. He only saw his little Roma, the
child who lived In her still; her. Innocent
sister who lay sleeping within. '

face;
. "You have told me a little of your life,"
he said: Â¦ "let 'me' tell - you something of

"I know you will."
"May Iâ may. I shake hands with you?"
she said.'f
- There was a moment of hesitation and
then their hands seemed to leap at each
other and clasp with a clasp of fire.
At the next instant he had lifted her
hand to his lips and was kissing it again
and again.
A sensation of triumphant joy flashed
through her. and instantly, died away.
She wished to cry out, to confess, to say
something, she knew not' what. But Da
vid L*?one is dead rang In her ears, and '
at the same moment she â¢ remembered
what the'impulse had been which brought
her to that house. \ ' Â¦ ',-'-. - : Â¦- Â§ â¢â¢ . .'
Then her eyes -began to "-swim and her
heart to fail, and she wanted^ to fly away
without uttering another word. She could
not speak; he Â¦ could not speak;'they stood
together on a precipice- where only by
silence could, they hold their heads.
"Let. me go home," she said in a break
ing, voice, and with downcast head: and
trembling limbs she stepped to the door.
After that David redeems his promise
of acting as a modeland Roma sees him
quite frequently . In her studio. To both
of them the past becomes clearer and
clearer, and one day at a little country
inn circumstances,- arise that bring the
matter to a turning point, and they admit
that each has -recognized the other.
Their eyes met, their hands clasped,
their pent-up secret was out, and in the
dim-lit catacombs of love two souls stood
face to face. ' - \
"How long have ypu known It?" she
whimpered.
"S!nce the night you came to the Piazza
Navona. And you?"
"Since the moment I heard your voice."
And then she shuddered and laughed.;. -
When they left the house of silence a
blessed hush had fallen on them, a. great
wonder which they had never known be
fore, the wonder of the everlasting mira
cle of human hearts. ...
David soon finds that he Is falling seri
ously in love, with the adorable . Roma.
He has sworn to devote his life, to the
cause of humanity and has always said
that if he ever found himself in such a
position .he should run from . the object
of his affection before' It was 'too late.
For this reason he ceases his visits,: Roma
soon finds out the cause. She begins to
love the man, for she realizes his great
' ness when he is. willing to atone for his
.slurring of her character.' by being seen,
with her at the theater and when he ac
cepts the innuendos of hersociety friends

"I am better now. Go on," she said.
. The whirring noise began again and
after a moment the clear voice came as
before: ?
."My-son, the promise I made when we
parted in London I fulfilled faithfully, but
the. !etter.I_wrote to you never came to

who I was, and why I changed my name.

be brief. I am Prospero "Volonna. ' My

nobody in Italy knows me as Roselli and
nobody in England as "Volonnaâ nobody

The hand tightened on Rossi's arm and
his head began to swim.
"Little by' little, in this grave of a liv

In Roma's studio the next day she sur
prises all her "fine friends, brings, ridicule
on the head of the Baron and partially
atones I for her first efforts to betray
Rossi. They are all assembled to look at
the statuary Roma .: has been working
upon for the municipal fountain.
â¢ "Superb!", they exclaimed, one after an
other. '.'Superb! Superb!" <
"But surely this is 'Hamlet' without the
Prince," said the Baron: "You set out to
make a fountain representing Christ and
his twelve apostles, and the only figure
you leave unfinished is Christ himself!"
-He .pointed to the central figure above
the ;diah. which. was merely shaped out
and Indicated.
"Not only one, your Excellency." s*id
Don Camillo." "Here is another unfinished
figureâ intended for Judas, apparently."
"I';Ieft them to the last on purpose."
said Roma. "They .were so important and
so difficult. But I have- studies for both
of them, in the boudoir, and you shall give
me your advice and opinion.
"It. was. so difficult to do justice to the
Christ that I am almost sorry T made the
attempt. But It came easier when I be
gan to think of some one who was being
reviled and humiliated and degraded be
cause he was poor and wasn't ashamed "of
it. and who was always standing up for the
weak and the down-trodden, and never re
turning anybody's Insult, however shame
ful and false and wicked, because ' he
wasn't thinking of himself at all. So I
got the best model I could in real life and
this is the result."
Wilh that she pulled off the muslin
veil arid revealed the sculptured head of
David Rossi, in a snow-white plaster cast.
The features expressed pure nobility, and
every touch was a touch of sympathy and
love. , .'. -.. - Â¦
A moment of chilling silence was fol
lowed by an underbreath of gossip. ""Who
is it?" ." "Christ, of course." "Oh. certain
ly; : but it reminds me of some one."
""Who can it be?" "The Pope?" "Why,
no; don't you Fee who it Is?" "Is it, real
ly?" "How shameful!" "How blasphem
ous!"
Roma stood looking on -with a face
lighted up by two flaming eyes. "I'm
afrald you don't think I've done justice
to my. model." she said. "That's qult^e
true. .But. perhaps my Judas will please
you better," and she stepped up to the
Jmst that was covered by the wet cloth.
"I found this a difficult subject also,
and it was not until yesterday evening
.that I felt able to begin on it."
Then, with a hand that trembled visi
bly, she took from the wall the portrait
of her father, and offering it to the-Min
ister, she said: Â¦ . ,
"Some one told me a story of duplicity
and treacheryâ it was about this poor old
gentleman. Baronâ and then I knew what
sort- of a person It was who "betrayed
his : friend arid master for thirty pieces
of silver, and listened to the hypocrisy,
the; flattery. Â¦ and lying of the miserable
group of parasites who crowded round
him because he was a. traitor, and be
cause he kept the purse."
With that she threw off the damp cloth,
and\revealed the *clay. modellof a head.
The face was unmistakable, but it ex
pressed every basenessâ cunning, arro
Â¦ gance, cruelty : and .sensuality.
;. . - The silence was . freezing,/ and the com
. pany began to turn away, and to mutter
Â¦among themselves, in order to cover their
confusion. "It's the Baron V*' "No?"
l*YeaC".Â« "Disgraceful!'.' "Disgusting!"
"Shocking!"- 1'A scarecrow!"
Roma watched them for . a , moment, and
then said: "You don't like my Judas!
Neither do I. You're rightâ It is â¢ dis
gusting." '
'A*nd taking- up in, both hands a piece
of thin wire, she cut the clay across, and
the upper part of it fell face downward
with a thud on the floor.
When they were all gone she shut the
dcor with a bang, and then turning to
David Rossi, who alone : remained, she
burst into a flood of hysterical tears, and
threw herself on her kneesat his feet
"David!" she cried.
"Don't "do that. Get up," he answered.
"Roma," he began, but her tears and
passion bore down everything.
"House, furniture, presents, carriages,
horses, everything will go soon, and' I
shall have loved nothing whatever! No
matter! You said a woman loved ease
and wealth and luxury. Is that all a wo
man loves? .Is there nothing else in the
world for any of us? Aren't you satisfied
with me at last?"
. "Roma," he answered, breathing hard,
"don't talk like that. I cannot bear It."
But she. did not listen. "You taunted
me with being a woman," she said
through, a fresh burst of tears. "A woman
was Incapatde of friendship and sacrifices.
She was intended to be a man's plaything.
Do you think I want to be my husband's
mistress? I want to be his wife, to share
his fate, whatever it may be, for good or
bad. for better or worse." -
"For God's sake, Roma!" he cried. But
she broke in on him again.
"You taunted me with the dangers you
had to go through, as if a woman must
needs be an impediment to her husband,
and try to -keep him back. Do you think
I want my husband to do nothing? If
he were content with that he would not
be the man I had loved, and I should de
spise him and leave him." - .
"Roma!" Â¦ â¢ â¢
"Then you. taunted me with the death
that hangs over you. When you were
gone I should he left to the mercy of the
world. . But that' can never happen.
Never! Do you think a woman can out
live the man she loves as I love you?
There! I've said It- You've shamed me
into It." â¢
. He could not speak now. His words
were choking in his throat, and she went
on in a torrent of tears: â¢-<>Â¦' *,
."The death that threatens you >comes
-from no fault of yours, but only from
your fidelity to my father. Therefore I
have a. right .to share it, and I will not
live when you are dead."
S "If I give way now," he thought, "all Is
Â¦ over.". . - -
And clenching his hands behind his
back to keep himself, from throwing his
arms around her he began in a low voice r
"Roma, you have broken your promise
Â¦ to : me."- .' " ' . '.' y/.'.i
."I don't care;" she interrupted. "I would
break ten thousand promises. I deceived
you. I confess it. I pretended to be rec
i onciled to your will, and I was not recon
vened. : I wanted you to see me strip my
self of all I had, that you might have no
anawer and excuse. . Well, you have seen
me < do , it, and now â what are you going
i to do now?" ... Â¦\- '.
. t "Roma." he began again, trembling all
, over, "there have been two men in me

'from yourself, while the other â the other
I Has been wanting you to despise all his

"David," she- .cried, "you love me! If

she flung both arms about his neck

until his throbbing nerves could bear the
. strain no lonser.

1 cried and at the moment when she threw
herself .upon him he stretched out his
3 arms to" receive her. a
"You do love me T' she said.
"Indeed, yes! And you? _ ;

cataract that sweeps the snow and the
Ice before It. ..
"You will never think the worse of me.
she faltered.
"The worse of you! For loving me?"
"For telling: you so and forcing myself
into your life?" â¢'-,'Â¦;
"My darling, no!" .."
' "But tell me," he said." "are you sureâ
quite sure? Do you know what is before
you?" * â¢ Â¦'-
"I only knirw I love you."
From this time 'on BonelU begins to
take a more active part. He realizes his
wrong step in turning over the betrayal
of â¢ Rossi to Roma, but he has already
learned enougn through her and by the
additional assistance of a' miserable police
spy, Charles Mlnghelli. to know that Da
vid Rossi and David Leone are one and
the same person.
V sentence of death hanpa over DavM
Leone for the part he took In the con
spiracy with Dr. Roselli. and the Baron
merely needs the last connecting link of
identification of RossÂ«t with Leone to en
able him to have Rossi convicted and
thereby rid himself of a dangerous polit
ical rival. Baron Bonelll now sees in
Rossi also a rival In the affections of the
younj? woman he lovea. so his Incentive to
eet Rossi out of the way has been dou
bled. He tries to get Roma to help him.
but. of course, the now refuses absolutely
to have anything to ilo with any scheme
that will jeopardize the life of the man
she loves. . . .
Roma warns David of the Baron's plot
ting, and flnaJly David sees that for the
good of the cause he must go away and
seek aid in foreign countries. 'Before he
leaved Roma and he are married by a
priest, although such a marriage is not
recognized by the laws of the country,
but there Is "not sufficient time for them
to publish the banns of a civil marriagp.
From Rossi's letters Roma is led tz. hf
lieve that he contemplates assassinating
the King upon his return to Rome. Th?
Baron gets an inkling that Roma fc^iows
this and goes deliberately to wor^ to
have her betray her husband. First he
tries t<Â» get her to give Rossi up by refer
ring to the past relations between them
selves and threatening her.
"Lean tell him that, according to the
lav/ of nature and of reason, you belong
to me." said the Baron." i
"Very well. It will be your word against
mine, will it not?"
"I can tell him," continued the Baron,
"that before God I am your husband, and
if he comes between us it will be only as
your lover and your paramour."
Although there is some truth In what
the Baron has to say, still Roma has not
been to blame, and so she writes to Rossi
and confesses all. The letters fail to
reach him until after he has returned to
Rome and many things have happened.
Failing in this point, Bonelll claims to
have evidence that Rossi expects to kill
the King-, and tells Roma that if she will
tell all sheSsnows Rossi will be arrested,
on another cSarare, saved from the crlma
of regicide and then allowed to go free
with banishment. Otherwise he will b<Â»
taken and undoubtedly sentenced to death.
She consents and signs a paper of Iden
tification that makes Rossi's arrest pos-
David returns to Rome but Is arrested
on the frontier and comes In as a prison
er. At the railway station In Rome hi3
brother anarchists rescue him and he es
capes In the crowd.
He goes straight to the room of Roma
The Baron is already there and trying
to persuade Roma to %o with him. Their
conversation has been long and â¢ ex
cited. Roma has a revolver in her hand
and has made up her mind to kill Bonelli
whan she hears the voice of Rossi.
Roma, who had forgotten all about the
Baron, was rooted to the spot on which
she stood. The Baron, who had under
stood everything, was also transfixed.
Then â¢ came a quick vibrating \ oice,
"Roma!"
Roma made a faint cry and dropped the
revolver out of her graspless hand. The
Baron picked it up instantly. He was the
first to recover himself.
"Hush!" he said In. a whisper. "Let
him come It. I will go Into this room.
I mean no harm to any one: but if he
should follow me â If you should reveal my
presenceâ remember what I said before
about a challenge. And If I challenge him
his shrift will have to-bÂ© swift and sure."
The Baron stepped Into the bedroom.
Then the emotional voice came again,
"Roma! Roma!" :
Roma staggered to the door, and opened
Rossi accuses" Roma of betraying
him. He has received none of her lettsrs.
and so, of course, la not Informed on all
that has happened. She has a difficult
part to play, for she realizes the presence
of the Baron in the next room and fears
the consequences. She throws herself on
his mercy and craves forgiveness.
"It is not your fault If the love you
brought home. to me is dead. I hoped that
before you came I might die too. I think
my soul must be dead already, ard here
I lay It at your feet. I dare not hope for
pardon, but If your great heart could par
don meââ" \~ -
He felt his soul fill with love and for
giveness. - <â¢
"But I know very well It is impossi
ble "
"Nothing 1 is Impossible, Roma. "We are
all children -In God's hand, erring: little
children: and If the "light of his love
which lights up the book of life could
shine on two more unfortunate ones "
She felt a sensation of swelling In her
throbbing heart, and rosÂ© up with shin
ing eyes.
"Roma, I confess .that when I escaped
from the police I came- here to ayengo
myself. They are following me, and I
shall inevitably be taken. But if yon tell
me that It was only your love that led
yon to denounce me â your love and noth
ing but your loveâ though I am bestrayed
and fallen and may be banished or con
demned to deathâ still â "
"I do say so! I do! I do!"
"Swear it, Roma."
"I swear â "
"The woman lies," said a voice behind
them.
. The Baron stood to the bedroom door
way. -..;.-
A terrible scene ensues." one of the
strongest in the book, in which the Baron
succeeds in convincing Rossi that Roma
has purposely betrayed him. and that she
has really been the mistress of Bonelll.
Rossi, in his mad fury, kills the Prime
Minister and tJjen seeks safety in the
sanctity of the Vatican.
The Pope admits David to the sanctu
ary, where he is free from arrest and
knows nothing of what is going on In the
outer world. He does not know that
Roma has accepted the blame of the mur
der, has been tried and sentenced to life
imprisonment..
Â¦ In the meantime a bloodless revolution
has taken place and the King has abdi
. cated his throne. David finally learns
of the heroic sacriflc<* of Roma and also
of her innocence." for the letters that she
had sent to him abroad reach him at the
Vatican and explain alL He rushes to
the Chamber of Deputies to give himself
up. but the members refuse to take anv
â¢action against him. and his name is men

A. U. ROBERTSON, Publisher,
126 Pest Street,
San Francisco. Cal.a. general in the civn war. This fact often
leads to the misspelling of the name. Gov
ernor. and .General Kearny . spelled "his
name with 'one . e, while '-Phil /.Kearney
spelled his with two. The proper spelling
is Kearny. This street-was once widened
twenty feet from Market street to Broad
way.
MONTGOMERY STREET was named
after Commander John B. Montgomery of
the United States sloop of â¢ war Ports
mouth, and whose marines' and sailors
took possession of Yerba Buena, July 9,
184(5, and raised the flag on the plaza,
which was afterward known, as, Ports
mouth Square. \ âÂ¦
WASHINGTON, JACKSON, TAYLOR,
FILLMORE, PIERCE and BUCHANAN
STREETS and GRANT AVENUE were
named after Presidents of the United
States.
HARRISON STREETâ Some persons
suppose this street was named after Gen
eral Will. am Henry Harrison, President
of the United States, but it Is aitogether
more probable that it was named after
Henry A. Harrison, who was a member
of the Ayuntamiento or Town Council in
1849-Â£0, and a member of the pioneer mer
cantile lirm of DeWltt & Harrison..
JEFFERSON STREETâ This street,
running from Black Point to the Presidio
and near the bay, is the only one named
after the author of the Declaration of In

United. States. Â¦â¢
MISSION STREET was Vlcinally the
onl-y road out to the Mission Dolores and
to Santa Clara and San Jose. It .went
partly through a swamp, considered to be
impassable lor vehicles. Charles L. Wil
son and his associates obtained 1 the right
to build a tollroad to the Mission. - They
leveled or graded Kearny street to Mar
ket, made a road along Â¦ Thfrd street to
Mission,' then out Mission street' to Six
teenth. Where necessary " thoy, filled up
the. swamp or marsh and' planked the
street: A tollgate was placed at Kearnv
and Post, streets, but "was shortly after
ward removed, to Mission Â¦ street. The
street, was finally- macadamized. > To pre
vent opposition they also improved Fol-^
sonv street and placed a' tollgate on it.
These tollgates remained for many years,
until cross streets, opened from Â¦ time to
time, enabled, people to avoid ' the". toll
gates, notwithstanding they were from
time, to time" moved to prevent such being
done. .. ';'. ,
. MARKET STREETâ Supposed to be so
called after Market street in either Phil
adelphia or Baltimore, 'or both, though
about the time this one was named the
latter was changed to Baltimore street.
This street took its present direction be
cause it was laid out parallel. to Mission
street. Sand hills fifty or more feet hlgn
stood on it, from Kearny street west up
until about 1859 or ISM.
VAN NESS AVENUSâ After James
Van Ness, a native of New York. He was
Mayor and Recorder (Police Judge) at the
time the consolidation act went into oper
ation in 1S56. He, as Mayor, approved. the
Van Ness ordinance, po-called, by, which
the city surrendered to the actual settlers
the lands within the pueblo west of Lar
kln street. ..."
: GEARY STREETâ After John W.

uate- of Jefferson College. . By profession
he was a civil engineer. He command
ed .a -regiment at Chapultepec, where he
was woundedi and was in command "of
the citadel., of Mexico after' its capture.
He came to San Francisco after the.Mex
ican war. ln.1849 he was Postmaster, then

after whom the streets of the city were
named: Â¦Â¦ -fw >* ' ' :'
KEARNY STREETâ Originally known
as "La* Calle de la Fundacion," or the.
'foundation, St'rcet;' was named after-Gen-
eral Stephen \V; Kearny, a nativejjf New'
Jersey, and a veteran of the war~of 1812.
He had been colonel of the First United
States Dragoons, and during the Mexican
war was ordered to 'march with his troops
and Doniphan's Missouri regiment across
the plains from Missouri, and conquer
and take possession of New Mexico, and
then proceed to California and conquer or
take possession' of it. Having taken pos
session of New Mexico he reached Cali
fornia' December 2, ? 1S46, acting under di
rect orders from , Secretary of War AVil
liam L. .Marcy. â¢â¢ He afterward fought the
battles of San Pasquale, San Bernardino,
San Gabriel and the Mesa^ near Los An
geles. He was the aon-in-law of Clark of
Lewis and Clark, who first crossed the
continent to the Pacific, in the famous
Oregon exploration.! When he reached
Â¦ California, Commodore Stockton, who had
arrived .in Monterey August 15, 1846; and
had then succeeded Commodore Sloat in
command; was at San Diego, and claimed
to be In supreme command of all the mili
tary and naval forces of the United States
in California, lie had been acting in con
junction with Colonel r John C. Fremont
and designed to make him military gov
ernor. Kearny, % however, repudiated
Stockton's claiin aÂ»d was sustained' by
the authoritlesat Washington. Stockton
then turned his command over to Commo-.
ciore Shubrick and- went east across the
plains. Kearny then became the first
military governor of California under
United States authority. .â¢*' Not a great
while afterward he returned ea.st through
New Mexico, taking with â¢ him Colonel
John C. Fremont, whom he h".:^ ;'2ail\}
under arrest for Insubordination.
Some persons suppose this street was
named after Phil Kearney, who was a
major during the- Mexican war and was
for a while stationed at Sonoma. He was
PRIOR to the year 1835 the few
ships that came into the bay of
San Francisco usually anchored op
posite the Presidio,; at Black Point,
at North Point or at Sausalito. The
latter, was inconvenient. and the anchor
age - v of the . others was -unsafe. .In
consequence p thereof i vessels 1 began ;to
seek the. shelter and better, anchorage
found off what, was known as Yerba 'Bu
ena Cove, and, the shipmasters petitioned
Governor FIgueroa to Â«stablish a port of
entry there. This petition was favorably
considered and - as Â¦-.'-Â¦ a ..- consequence the
town site, of Yerba Buigna, of, which San
Francisco is the successor, was laid out
at the head of the cove in the latter part
of October, â¢ 1835,' by Francisco . de Haro,
an- Alcalde residing at the Mission Do
lores.'- " *; '..'."'Â¦ ,-;' %Â¦ Â¦ ';
He did so by. marking upon .the ground
a simple street called La Calle tie la Fun.
dacion, or Foundation street. It. started
from a point near the present corner of
Kearny and Pine streets; and ran Jin a
northerly direction toward North Beach,
having Telegraph Hill, at,- one end and
sand hills' at the other.
The place was "then declared to be a
port of entry, and Captain William A.
Richardson, who had arrived in Califor
nia in 1823, and had become a natural'z:d
citizen of Mexico, was made captain of
the. port, :11c had been acting as agent
of a couple of schooners that were en
gaged in carrying on a desultory trade
up and down the sea coast.' He made a
rough'sketch of the location,' and having
brought' his family over from Sausalito i
where he had long resided, fixed his resi
dence on the side hill near where Dupont
street now is; between Clay ami Wash
ington, streets. His house, being ft combi
nation of house.- and tent, was the first
one located in the future city and he. and
his family Were the first residents. Â¦'Â¦

tained -ln s the' neighborhood of thirty or
forty, houses, .located . in - the sandhill3
around the present Dlaza. .-.. Â¦

survey to be made of the place, and Jose
Castro, the prefect of the ' district-, em
ployed for that purpose Jean J. Vioget,
who in November of that year surveyed
and platted out the village of Yerba Bu
ena," included between the present Broad
way, Montgomery, Powell. and California
streets. . N > . .
He did not, however, name any of the
streets, nor did Richardson do so on his
rough sketch. . Â¦,.
'On the 9th day of July. 1S4S, Commandrr
John B. Montgomery of the I'nitcd States
sloop of war Portsmouth, with seventy
seamen and marines -under, command of
Lieutenant' Watscn. took possess'on of the
village and ra!?od the United Statis flag.
He appointed a naval ollicer. Lieutenant
Washington A. Bartlett, Alcalde of the
place, the tlrst Sunder -United States
authority. In September . Bartlett was
elected to ' tho position, which he held
until February, '1847. This Was not the
Washington v Part!ett ; who was many
years afterward elected Go vtsrhor of the
State. . ..
Wheji, Lieutenant Uartlett ended his
career as Alcalde he resumed his^position
as an officer of tho navy. and sailed away,
neveTÂ» afterward to have any connection
with -the history of the citv or Siaie. â¢ Â»
Bartlett, as Alcalde, employed a civil
engineer, named Jasper O'Farrell, who. in
1S45 had been in the military service with
General John A. Sutter, to enlarge the old
Vioget survey of 1S39. O'Farrell took the
present corner of Kearny and Washing
ton streets as his starting point and en
larged the survey as far as North Beach,
and west as far as Taylor, street. vHe laid
out Market street as the future main
thoroughfare, corresponding in direction
with Mission street, the road to the Mis
sion Dolores, 'which, on: account of the
prevailing 1 sandhills and salt marsh, was
the only road at that time leading out of
the *city. The survey south of Market
street ran on 'Second and Third streets as
far as South Beach, and on Market street
as far as Fifth street, leaving out the
swamps or marsh south and west of Mis
sion and fourth streets.
O'Farrell named all the streets em
braced in, his survey, and .'laid down on
his map and numbered the" tifty-vara lots
between TaylorVand Post streets and the
bay.
' In the following year, 1847, by direction
of Alcalde Edvvin Bryant, O'Farrell also
laid off, surveyed and mapped the beach
and water lorproperty Â¦ lying between
Montgomery and East streets, Telegraph
Hill and Rincon Hill.
In the meantime, however, Alcalde
Bartlett had by proclamation, dated
January 19, 1847,. changed the name of the
village of .Ycrba Buena (meaning a god
herb) to that'ot San Francisco, and by
that name it was finally, on April 13, lf>50,
chartered as a city by the State Legis-

I HOPE all those who are taking . ad
vantage of these lessons in the "Best
of All Games" now are perfectly fa
miliar with the leads, as it is essen-
tial that they should have their
minds perfectly clear to draw the "infer
ences to be drawn from the play of each
card, and, therefore, they should not be
harassed by doubt as to the card they
rnuet lead first of all.
Taking it for granted that yon do know
exactly what to lead, we will begin on
the follow, or second play, in the same
suit. You pick up a hand containing ace,
queen, Jack, eight of spades, queen, ten.
seven of diamonds; eight, six, four of
hearts: ace, king, two of clubs; the queen
of clubs turned for trump to your right.
At a glance you know spades to be the
suit you should open. You 'also see that
you ha\*e an ace lead in it, and you lead
it, to which falls the two, four, six of
spades respectively. Now. as you have
but four in suit, and your partner can
not be sure until your second play
whether you held originally four or five,
your second play of the queen tÂ£lls him
that yÂ»u have exactly four in suit and
that you have the knave also and you
deny the king. Had you five in suit you
would follow the ace with the knave,
showing the queen and five in suit. It
has been proved that giving all the in
formation possible to your partner Â«is to
exact holdings rives you the greatest ad
vantage, even though your opponents are
also Informed, your partner being in the
petition to assist you to establish your
suit.
Again, you hold ace, ten, nine, eight,
seven and two of spades (not trumps). You
lead the ace und it makes. Here you
must follow with your fourth best, even
though your seven is in sequence and ap
parently as valuable us the eight, your
fourth best. If you must play from this
suit again before you have established it
you must play the seven, holding up the
two. The two, not falling to .the three
rounds, your partner gives ' it to you,
thereby reading you with six spades. Had
you played the two he could only play
you for five spades, which might make a
material difference in his game.
Holding king, queen, ten and nine, you
lead the king, showing four in suit. It
wins. Your partner apparently has the
ace. else your king would . have been
taken, although an opponent holding ace,
knave and small will sometimes, if strong
in trumps, play low so as to win the sec
ond trick with the jack, holding up the
ace to prevent you from establishing your
suit, but as this does not happen often it
will not be mentioned again. You follow
with the nine, showing the ten, queen and

the statue of Liberty facing the ocean and

own country and It seems that, his genius

Third in Series of Whist Lessons by Mrs.
Adolph Hess of the San Fran
cisco Whist Club.
You hold a hand containing a knave,
lead king, queen, knave and three small.
You lead the knave, and when you next
lead that suit you must lead the flucen,
showing six in suit. Had you fonowed
with the king you would have shown live
in suit exactly. Holding ace. King, queen,
knave and three small you lead the knave,
and follow with the queen. Your knaVe
winning gives you the ace. king ana queen.
You follow with the queen, snowing two
higher, the king and the ace, and shows
seven in suit. Had you followed wjth the
king you would show six, and had you
followed with, the ace you woulu have
shown exactly live in suit. Your tirst lead
of. cither ace. queen or knave shows tive
at least in suit. Your follow determines
whether you held exactly five or more; If
more, how many more. The lead of the
ten shows four in suit and shows queen
and knave also in hand, leur second ( lead
or foliow shows the exact length; if you
follow the ten led wfth the knave- you
show five in suit (the ten winning); if fol
lowed by the queen you show four In suit,
and you show ihe nine also; if folio-wed by
a smaller card than the nine you show
four cards in suit and deny the nine. You
hold ace, king, queen and two more, it is
a queen lead. Followed by the ace shows
the king and exactly two more. Kollowec*
by the king shows the ace and three more,
making six in suit. The lead of the ninÂ©
shows exactly lour In suit, except from
the combination of kins, knave, ten,
nine. If the nine forces the ace you fol
low, of course, with the king. If it forces
the queen and riot the ace, you. : follow
with the ten to show six. or with the
knave to show five, and the king to show
exactly four. There is hardly a single fol
low that will not proclaim the exact nu
merical strength.
., 1 he management of trumps . is a sub
ject the best writers on* the game do not
all agree upon. Some say if you have
five trumps it is always right to lead
them; others that unless you nave a good
long suit and a. re-entry in another suit
or your partner by his lead has shown
great strength in trumps it is- best not
to lead them. . .
To lead out all the trumps must', be
good for one side only â the side possess
ing the long- suits â so if you extract the
trumps and the suits must winÂ»on their
merits, you should possess those suits to
win the same. . '
You are very likely to play, the adver
saries' game if you draw- all. the trumps
just because you had five trumps and
had no suit to bring: In.
It is better to play a backward game,
unless your hand is Invincible or unless
your partner has shown great strength
in the suits or between you you have one
great suit with a re-entry in another, or
to prevent a double ruff if the adversaries
have shown .-weakness in trumps, thereby
givins your partner some strength, two
rounds cf trumps will do no harm. \ ,
To attempt to lead out the trumps and
to establish a long suit when you are not
strong enough to do so is a fatal error.
Holding six trumps, unless you are void
of two suits and weak in the third, you
shouid lead trumps. . Â¦..'
Holding seven trumps, it .would nearly
always be right to lead them.
With four trumps, unless you have good
cards in all three of < the other suits. It
would be seldom right to lead them un
less you had a suit established which was
in danger of being ruffed, a re-entry in
another suit, or your four irumps were
the best.
Sometimes it is right to lead trump !
from three or even two trumpsT having
command of all the suits.' or ti> prevent a
double ruff or. protect cards in your own
or your partner's hand. Whist perceptioa
alone, can enable a player to determine
the time to lead trumps. A" round too suon
or a. round too late may: ruin ' a good
hand. .^" . - < , .
lh.p ace of trumps is the only singleton ,
everlcd by strong players. When a player
leads the ace of trumps (a singleton) as
an original lead, he should have com
plete command of all the other suits.
The next lesson will.be on the "signal"
for trumps and -the second, .third, and
fourth hand play..- _ ; -.
v.ouid have held an impromptu meeting
and probably decided all about It before
I could have sot a word in edgewise.
But none of them knew, and conse
quently the twenty that were in town
came brimful of comrnendable curiosity.
The rtading-room. which had been bor
rowed from a fev/â a very few â of the
Native Sons who were in ( the secret, was
lull of life and animation. Â«*^
Of ali the discussion you ever heard 1
this was the fiercest. There were all
kinds of pros and cons, and nobody really
knew what they were talking about, or,
nearer to the point, what they wanted
to talk about. I was the only one who
had thought about the subject at all, and
I assure you I had my hands full to keep
the numerous misapprehensions corrected. .
A, temporary organization was what I
wanted. I knew if we proceeded that far
we TTculd never totally backslide. The
girls wanted timeâ wanted to think it over
and have another meeting.
As 1 didn't see any necessity for that
I called for members enough to till the
offices and I got them. So the organiza
tion that is in such a flourishing condi
tion now was launched without a private
but with a full auota of officials..
Before we adjourned the date of the sec
ond meeting was designated as Saturday,
September 25. 18S6. 1 breathed easier.
The idea that had been bothering me so
long had been given a fair start.
And then the men came to thefoie as
they usually do. If we had failed they
would have kept a grim silence with an
"I told you so" expression on : their
faces. ' But as we succeeded they
r* jr iSS JONES is most cordially re
/ \ f\ quested to be present at the K.
I jr I S. G. W. reading-room at pre-
I cisely 1:30 p. m., on Saturday,
September 11, 1SS6."
That is exactly the wording of the twen
ty-four notes that I sent out when I had
the founding of the Native .Daughters in
my mind.
1 knew many Native Son.s and thought
the order an exceedingly pood one. Be
sides the social side of the organization,
and that is a large side with them, the
benefits derived were of the very best and
almost equaled the stronger orders.
Whenever I suggested the idea it was
immediately frowned down. The men
thought that a side issue, would take
some of their glory from them instead of
enhancing it. They were rot the bit
enthusiastic about it; didn't, in fact, like
to hear the subject mentioned.
I didn't say anything then, but I
thought a good deal. Later I went to
Sacramento to celebrate Admission day,
and then I had the fever worse than ever.
If the men could accomplish so much, cer
tainly the women could do equally well.
That was the 9th of September, and im
mediately after the festivities^ were over
I went home. The very first thing I did
was to lay in a supply of stamps and then
I sat down and wrote those twenty-four
notes. I believe in doing things when the
mood Is on. They are very much more
apt to be well carried out.
The notes were ambiguous. I intended
.them to be. That was an almost certain
way of getting them all there. Had I
said why. I desired their presence they

In 1Â£?5 it was voted that "the Grand
Parlor shall De composed of paet grand
presidents," -the founder, Miss Lilly O.
Reich ling, and the past grand secretary,
qeorgie C. Ryan, retaining continuous
membership in the order, all grand offi
cers of the expiring* terms and all dele
gates duly elected by the various subordi
nate parlors."
So you see the Grand Parlor duly
recognized me as the founder, and . they
Â¦were extremely courteous to me and Miss
Ryan. , - . %
Then in/% they gave me a voice and a
vote. One funny thins happened about
the Grand Lodge. When the delegates
were being elected for the first Grand
Parlor spme of the ladies said plainly
that I. was too young to be sent. They
thought some one wiser and more de
liberate should be chosen to Kelp, the first
executive body. Even when a friend of
mine laughingly remarked that if I was
old enough to set such a ball rolling, I
certainly knew enough to give it a good
push in the' right direction, my elders
were firm and carried the day. I didn't
go then, but later when I had . gained
wisdom with years.
My sole ambition now is to do' some-'
thing to help the State as well as to per
petuate the order. Now thaY things are
swinging fairly well, I have been con
centrating all my energies on one object.
That is' trying to make the girls see what
a big benefit it would be if we could buy
up all the State's historical landmarks
and all the ancient documents and pre
serve them from vandalism. It seems
that< such a measure would be of in
estimable service to us alT;
At the last Grand Parlor I presented a
resolution that ought to assist us very
materially in this line of work. I will
quote it exactly: ,..
We report favorably on resolution Introduced
by Lilly O. Reichltng relating to historical
landmarks, etc.: . '.-.;
Whereas, It is apparent that, many historical
landmarks in the State of California are fall
ing Into decay, suffering at the hands of van
dals or giving . way to the march of "im
provement"; apd whereas, it is believed that
many relics and documents of historical value
exist which are held In light appreciation by
their possessors; and whereas, it is the sense
of this Grand. Parlor, that such landmarks,
when practicable. . should be preserved and
their ; historical value made â¢ public, ' and" -Jthat
the relics, documents and other scattered arti
cles of, historical value should be- gathered-to
Â¦pether and. preserved "for the 'benefit p of : the
State arid its people, and as it is a just and
becoming: task for a patriotic organization like
the Native Daughters of the Golden "West to
undertake the work of searching for, preserv
ing:, and perpetuating such landmarks and
gathering together, all such . historical docu
ments and reltes as arp not already set apart
fn the archives of the State or In museums or
other repositories accessible to the public;
therefore be it ":
. Resolved. That preliminary to the work of
such preservation and collection the Grand
President is hereby . authorized - to appoint a
Keneral committee of not less than three, which
committee shall proceed at onre, upon its ap
pointment, to communicate with the subordi
nate parlors with a. view to securing informa
tion concerning: the location, character, owner
ship, condition and value of such articles or

straightway wanted to. proffer. assistance
and have, if iiot the lion's share, a good
part of it.
Curtis H. Lindley gave us invaluable
aid in writing the constitution,; by-laws,
and the ritual to further facilitate organ
ization. Mr. Wndley presided by request
at cur second meeting. The charter offi
cers wore elected and then as there must
be a past president I was chesen to act'
in that capacity. Those selected, to/ act
with me were: Mrs. Tina : L. Kand,
president;. Mrs. Hatlie L.'. Freeman, -first
vice president*; Mrs. Mollic Folgcr, "sec-,
or.d vice president; Mrs. Lizzie M. Lind
ley, third vice president: Maggie Stasal, '
recording secretary; Mrs. Amy Badeie,;
iinarc:al secretary; Flora Dunning, mar
shal: Kittle Murray, treasurer; Agnes
Leonard, inside sentinel; . Rose Stasal,
outside sentinel. . : - ;
These were _ the first officers, and ; I
doubt if a third of the active members
have the faintest idea what any of their
names are.
And then we were kept busy from that
time until March concentrating all our
efforts on establishing a secret Viciety.
Wilb a bevy of. ladies all suggesting and
advising it is difficult to arrive at a defi
nite conclusion in a hurry. Even then
Mr. Lindley wrote"our rilual and we tuseJ
it fcr eight years steadily. . ;.
That ritual, by the way, was a bone of
contention in the lodge for a long Mima.
Some of the bright shining lights im
agined that they were brilliant enough
to write a ritual of their own. They fan
cied that the "Old- Judge Linuk-y" ritual
was about worn out, and besides they
wanted to be original. Well, they found
out that to' be original was extremely
trying ilnd diflicult work-; After a long, 1
hard struggle ' they finally- had to
acknowledge themselves well beaten.
The work of the Judge was plenty good
enough for a'l of us. . ;
Four years after that timg one of our
members suddenly sprung a ritual uu us
that was a clever surprise, and that
pleased us mightily. That, woman \yad
Mrs., Minnie Gunzendorler, and since
that time the old ritual has been laid
abide and htw used constantly and weli.
So that proved that women have as much
brains, as much executive . ability anJ
know as much about parliamentary laws
as do the men. >>''!Â¦- -"
And parliamentary law reminds me of
something. The Native* Daughters pride
thcmselvts on- knowing -the ruiesjtluit are
laid * down in that little brown booK,
backward. They can reel them off by the
yard and take pleasure in doing it in the
bargain.; .-. Â¦
Once in a while during a session Mrs. A.
proposes a certain mot.on and then to
show wherein it will prove a distinct ad
vantage to everybody concerned brings
all her knowledge to bear on the point.
Of course that is merely to make it per
fectly clear and comptehensive, you un
derstand. If Mrs." B. does not like the
idea she will stand forth, and oppose the
amendments right heartily. ., She, in turn,
.will try and outdo her neighbor's exten
sive knowledge in the House of : Parlia
ment's by-laws and, if she is clever,
things will suddenly veer her way.
There is a battle royal on. In a very
lartdm&rKs above mentioned: and be It further
Resolved. That the general committee herein
provided for shall submit to the next Grand
Parlor a plan for utilizing the information it
may acquire: and be it further
Resolved. That the Grand Parlor recognizes
the value of the historical research carried on
by various persons and societies, and that it
is at all times willing to co-operate with such
societies and individuals; and it Is hereby or
dered that copies of these resolutions be sent
to all known organizations of this character
and to the press, the co-operation and support
of which ia earnestly desired and requested.

The task looks too large to some of us
and* our funds are too low to enable us
to buy many of the valuable relics, but
I do know of one way -that our tradi
tions, at least, could be' kept fresh and
new.-.
If .we could collect a series of stories
and myths concerning the early days
and have them printed and introduced
into our public schools as readers, it
would do more to keep the memory of
early California alive than anything that
I can now think of. At the same time
the expense would be comparatively lit
tle, and one of our chief objects ob
tained.
You know, one of our main principles
is patriotism, that and the desire to be
of some help to those people who noe-1
assistance, and there are plenty of them
in this old world of ours."
Our new president asked us to take for
our motto, "Do right." She furthermore
told us that "Words are little things, but
they strike hard. "We utter them so eas
ily that we are apt to forget their hid
den power." She urgently asked us to
follow her rule. "Women are . prone to
find out that "power and use it as they
see fit. and it is not always in the best
and wisest way. 1 : â¢~\j
Our order is a beneficiary one, but we
have not been able to pay, all the bene
fits that we would like to. This coming
year the subordinate parlors will debate
on how it will be possible to have a
uniform funeral expense throughout the
State. ' It has .already been proposed to
tax every member 10 cents, which will
permit Â»i paying $75 toward each funeral.
.This wilj in no wise interfere with the
regular sums paid by Individual parlors.
In that way every one will be aided and
at such a time there is always plenty of
use for money. . It la often a Godsend to
some of us.
The small tax of 10 cents will bring lu
fully $450, and as soon as the amount
falls below S3C0 the same sum will be
levied again. Last year there were only
twenty-five deaths, so you see the sum
demanded from the individual members
would be very small. We feel that ev
ery one of us can cheerfully afford to
help those who need it, for none of us
know when it will be our own turn.
When any significant movement has
been on foot that wttl aid the State we
try to be the first to offer our hearty co
operation. If we can always be the first
in the field to do good I shall feel that
my part of the , work has not been in
vain, and I shall be entirely pleased and
satisfied with it. â¢ -
THE;-/ SUND A Yx/CAIilj^

How I Organized the Native
Daughters.In lÂ©2. at the session of the Grand Par
lor of Native Daughters held in Sacra
mento, a board of relief, consisting of fif
teen members, was organized to take full
charge of a sum of money donated to the
order for charitable purposes.
Ths organization had little demand
made upon this fund, or little resources
for really discovering those In need. But
the serious illness of one or two promi
nent members, who had at one time been
In most affluent circumstances, but met
unexpected reverses, suggested to
one of the philanthropic members of the
organization the necessity of a hospital
ward.
To buy one in any of the existing hos
pitals did not seem feasible, and after
much thought and careful planning it was
decided to establish a. home for Native
Daughters. The now flourishing institu
tion on O'Farrell street is the result.
The committee selected this small and
modest home of ten rooms, but the popu
larity and usefulness of the home now
make it necessary that larger and more
commodious quarters shall soon be ob
tained.
The furnishing of the hospital ward was
the first consideration. AH modern con
veniences for the sickroom are provided.
A room that was sunny and cheerful
â¢was selected. The regulation white enam
el beds were set up side by side and then
all the modern conveniences for a sick
room were provided. The place really
looks like a miniature hospital, and many
times its looks do not belie it.
If any of the girls are seriously ill they
are taken in and the door swings to after
them and a trained nurse. There ; they,
are kept close prisoner until they are
absolutely well, and the very best atten
tion is given them. That room is really
the basic principle of the house. They have
found In their work that such, a place was
needed more than almost any other. -When
one is ill, poor and generally unfortunate,
such a place is indeed an earthly haven.
In order to make the home self-support
ing to some extent at least rooms were
furnished for the accommodation of any
visiting Native Daughter who might de
sire a quiet and safe home in the city.
The idea of home pervades everything.
While the girls are not restricted, still
they have many privileges of a home. If
they are hungry and tired all they, have
to do is to visit the pantry. There -they
will find those kinds of things that re
mind one of home and mother. A glass
of milk and a piece of real home-made
cake tastes so much better than anything
that one could possibly buy at a restau-
rant.
Thanks to the donations of friends, the
house is comfortably and tastefully fur
nished. â¢ Â¦'
The drawing room presents a very cozy
appearance, with its good piano and well
selected library. The guests of the home
enjoy assembling here in the evenings.
Besides that, it has the look of home
about it that has the power to keep so
many homesick giris from being blue and
lonely. It always seems easier to entei
taln one's friends if the room- is cozy,
pretty and thoroughly pleasant. Judg
ing from the merry sounds that come
from the drawing -room, it must be all
of that.
The home is not intended in any sense
to be a charitable institution, but tha
It Is hoped as the' members of 'the or
ganization of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West realize the growing use
fulness and nacessity for such an Institu
tion that each and every member will
put forth her best efforts, that they may
find the home permanently located in
large and commodious quarters of their
own.
Each day the home is visited by some
member, of the committee. Mrs. Leake
has' proved herself a. most capable and
efficient" chairman of the home commit
tee. Much of tho success of the home is
due to her untiring efforts and unselfish
devotion to every detail of the manage
ment of the home. It Is to her that they
owe the greater part of the furniture of
the home, especially the Mervyn Leako
room. Whenever anything is needed she
is always the first to assist, and it 'is
owing to her ceaseless efforts that the
home has prospered so exceedingly.
The i home committee consists of Mrs.
'H. M. Greene, San Franci3co: Dr. Mari
ana Bertola, San Francisco; Mrs. Louise
Morris, San Francisco: Mrs. J. A. Stein
bach, San Francisco; Mrs. W. S. Leake.
San . Francisco, and Miss Clara K. Wit
tenmeyer. Mills College, They meet the
first Friday of each month, when all bills
are settled in full and ways and means
are discussed for increasing the comforts
of the guests and adding to the usefulness
of the home.
The original fund has not been touched
and has slowly accumulated, now amount
ing to $2000. From time to time donations
have been received from parlors and In
dividuals of linens, books, fruits, grocer
ies, etc., which have been very acceptable
and have materially aided in reducing the
expenses of the home.
the visitors are so continually going to
places of interest that good, wholesome
food Is necessary.
The management provides plain but well
cooked and wail served mealsâ nothing
that a French chef would turn out- in
some 'heme where money is no .object,
but the kind of meal that an old colored
mammy would give to one who required
strength. For most of the girls who live
at the home earn their own living, and
The rate for members from contribu
ting parlors Is $18 per month, including
room.' light, fires, bath and three meals
a day. For members from non-contribu
"tins parlors the rate is $20 per month. .
This institution has certainly found a
large field -of usefulness in providing
homesTfor members from the interior,
who perhaps desire to pursue some line of
- study by which they may become self
supportfhg. Students obtain home com
. forts here at the least possible cost, and
in a number, of cases have been allowed
. to remain, at the home indefinitely until
such time as they could obtain positions,
' and pay in small sums.. During the past
year it has been the home of students of
bookkeeping, oratory, telephone, stenog
raphy and music. Four grand officers
have resided at the home . and ninety
members have been, accommodated at
various times, 3 while 600 members have
visited the home. . Friends of Native
Daughters may be accommodated at any
time when there may* be vacancies.
Girls who have lost their positions, and
-who are in need are. always sure of a
.warm 'bed and plenty to eat until they
' are able to help themselves. -And this is
v so'in the case of country girls who some
times come to the city in quest of em-*
ployment. If they fail to get It they are
cared for until something turns up in
their favor.., . â¢ .
sick and - unfortunate are taken care - of
without cost when necessary. Â¦

,' \ JACK HARPER.
Accidents and hold-ups? Well, no. I
think I was exceptionally fortunate re
garding them. I 'never was on a train
that'met with an accident. One or two
switches had been left open, but no
wreckage or disturbance to speak of. As
to hold-ups, my mail car was always on
the train which passed just before or
just after the one held up, until on my
wedding tour; going and returning the
bandits Waylaid us, but with no serious
results. ' OS;
There would be a violin with its neck
broken; a box with a bonnet tumbling
out; then boxes of candy all falling to
pieces. Once I picked up a box of home
made butterscotch. It was all. untied, and
after taking a taste I laid it aside, think
ing I might get time to wrap it more se
curely and send it on its way. But in the
hurry, and bustle the corner of the box
grt-w larger and the contents grew
smaller. It was too much temptation for
hard .working men to resist, and besides
it" tasted so good.
' Talk about wasted 'mail! Great good
ness! You can't begin to imagine the
loads upon loads of stuff that never
reached its destination, especially at
Christmas time. Things poorly wrapped
up, not properly addressed or lack of
postage. At Christmas the boxes of
stuff that people sent, from Maine to
California, would half the time be
thrown away.
out. It wasn't as it is now, where there
are several men in a car and you can
change off occasionally and see something
of the places you go to. â¢ Â¦ .
You see, I had a rather lonely time
of it on the trips, for I had my mail car
all. to- myself and had to stay with it.
There were places where the scenery was
so magnificent that if you were a man
with the least bit of romance about you
you would sit there in your car smok
ing, your pipe and | looking, at the long
ridge of mountains, ; imagining some of
the most beautiful air castles that your
mind was capable of conceiving. " Then
there were times when the long, dusty,
hot' ride Was anything but agreeable and
rest at night dreadfully broken. The en
gineer used to make that engine give
such , a piercing shriek ;to make me Wake
up at the stations where. I had to throw
off the mail that I would Jump out of
my bunk with! a bound. In my mail car
I ; had my kitchen, sleeping and working
apartments all . nicely arranged, and it
was a case of live there day In and day
would surely have seen that something
was ' up. ' But no, we didn't suspect a
thing until they, commenced to throw
dice, and after asking us to take part, one
desperate looking fellow began- to edge
our way. Then it suddenly dawned upon
me what they were up to. By this time
the place had become quite full, so, buy
ing some cigars, saying we had heard
them highly spoken of, we watched our
chance and made a break for the door.
Our only fear was that the door would be
closed and there we would be with the
most desperate looking men one could fall
in with. Â¦ I tell you we didn't feel safe
till we crossed that bridge and were on
the American side. The Custom-house
officer said if he had known where we
were going he would have warned us
against the Mexican "bunko steerers." It
was but a few years after that the Chief
of Police of San Francisco and a. fellow
officer while down there were beaten ( and
rbbbed in the very place where we had
been that day.
The road was next extended to El Paso,
and it was here that I had an. experience
that taught me not to trust every one 1
met. El Paso stands on the American
side of the Rio Grande, and . just across
the bridge on the Mexican side Is Paso del
Norte. We had several hours to wait.
While stopping here I picked up a young
fellow and we crossed 'the bridge. After
we had been looking, about some time a
man. came up Â£iid "asked us if we didn't
want to' see a cock fight. Of course we
were in for sights and went with him.
He looked; like a tourist and said ; hehad
just come from. the City of Mexheo. We
followed him into a long adobe building,
where he first led. the way to a bar. He
called for drinks and cigars, making him
self very' agreeable meanwhile. The bar
tender was . an awful looking Mexican,
one who would cut .your : throat for 10
cents. If we nadn't been so" green'. wÂ«
The houses at YurnÂ«*were of, adobe and
the people slept In the> dooryards or on
the. flat roofs. At one time my run ex
tended; only to Yuma, and while waiting
for the return trip It 'was Interesting to
watch the Indians. Being In the habit
of cooking^my own meals in the mail' car
and having run out of milk, I hailed an
Indian boy who was passing with a huge
jar on his shoulder. I held up several
very tempting bunches of grapes. He un
derstood, and hastily looking up and down
to make sure that none of his customers
were about, he gave me a very generous
can of milk. Of course, some of his cus
tomers were forgotten that morning.
e^en the iron on the inside of my mail
car would be blazing hot from the dread
ful heat.
It wasn't long before my route extended
to Demlng, N. M., 1203 miles from San
Francisco, and we made three round trips
a month, taking seven days for a trip.
Hot! My! but the hottest place we ever
struck Was at Yuma, Ariz., on the Colo
rado River. Before = reaching Yuma we
passed through the 1 Colorado/desert, 250
feet below the level of the sea. Before
entering the desert a huge, water car had
to be attached to > the engine. Â¦-- At times
There was one place where we railroad
men always fared weir and at no expense
to ourselves. This was at the old land
mark at Merced, the Capltan, the place
for getting off and connecting with the
stages 'for Yosemite. It was a large,
handsome hotel and they always set free
lunches for the'railroad men. Thl3 was
done to attract the attention of the pas
sengers in order that they would patron
ize the place. * ,
The next extension of the road was to
Los Angeles, the first train entering that
city from the north In July, 1876. Trains
had been coming Into the city previous to
that time, however, from Colton, sixty
miles south. Of course, by this time the
mixed train had been abolished; it was
now a through passer.ger.
Within a few months the line was ex

dled with bullets; whether they were
tramps or professional hold-ups I could
not tell. I decided to run the risk of sig
naling to the engineer to stop, which was
done. They proved to be tramps and were
speedily dropped.
Once, when we were on a run southâ
I cannot forget the nightâ I was sitting
there sorting out the mail , for' the next
stopping place. I happened to glance up
at the little skylight and, there were three
pairs of eyes peering down on me. It had
the most startling -effect imaginable
alone in the car, no weapon in reach from
where 1 sat, I fully expected to be rid-
Talk about safety! ,A mail car was very
poorly protected â nothing in comparison
to its protection to-dayâ and the life' of
the mall clerk was a( the mercy of any
one, boxed in his car alone as he always
was.
We also traveled with mixed trains,
part passenger, part freight, with the mail
car at the rear and dust â whoo! I- can
taste it yet. The fastest time we made
was from eighteen to twenty miles an
hour, the freight causing many annoying
stops.
By the way, let me say, regarding the
mode of travel, that Is, time, equipment
of cars, etc., things were in a very 'crude
state. The cars had flat roofs and the
only method of ventilation was a very
small opening or skylight,' and the abomi
nable oil lamps smoked you out by morn
ing.
When I first went on? Well, let
me see. My first run was in "74. Starting
frpm Stockton, California, and extending
within four miles of Bakersfield, that be
ing the extent of the railway; from there
the mall was carried by stage to Los An
geles.
yES, I am an old-timer in the United
States Railway Mail Service, and
many a queer time we had on the
line, too.. :
Soda Lake, on the Mojave Desert. Her*
-was a station guarded by Higgtns and
Sutton. This station was on the most
traveled wagon road to Ivanpaugh, where
very rich silver mines were being worked.
Ivanpaush was also an Indian center and
headquarters.
The station at Soda Lake* netted a largo,
sum each month to those in charge, and
Higgins and Sutton coined money. It was
their expressed determination never to
leave the station in spite of some Indian
fights, but at last came an adventure that
frightened them into abandoning It. An
old squaw came to the station, and by
pointing to her mouth and doubling up
showed every sign of agony from hunger,
and In this manner requested to be fed.
After receiving a supply of food she left
silently in Indian fashion. Nothing was
seen of her for a few days. The circum
stance occasioned no suspicion until the
end of three days, when the same squaw
returned, wounded and bleeding.
They again befriended the woman, took
her in and gave her food and such medi
cal aid and care as their rude mode of
life allowed. .She soon appeared better
and began to move about their little tt&\}%
in an aimless manner. Suddenly an Ini '
stlnctive suspicion awoke In the two. Had
she been sent as a spy by the Indians to
locate their ammunition, money and
food and to estimate their power of re
sistance to an attack from the Indian
rancheria near Ivanpaugh?
This suspicion, at. "first vague, grew
from fear to almost maniacal frenzy, and
after many whispered consultations, with,
their guns by. their side, they determined
to kill the woman and close her mouth
against them forever. Accordingly the
plans were laid, and executed, but new
questions arose to complicate matters.
What was to be done with the remains?
If they were buried outside the Indiana
might find and dig them up, or they
might even now be watching the- cabin
Â¦'from behind some rock or cactus. In
either case if the body were carried out
of doors they would be found out and
made to suffer.
As a final resort one of them suggested
that the Interment take place underneath
the earth of the kitchen floor, and this.
Plan was finally chosen. The grave being
dug. the poor old Indian's body was rolled
in. covered up and all possible signs ob
literated; but their troubles were not at
an end. The body had scarcely been cov
ered when the fear crept upon them that
they had already been watched. The Im
agination of the two men once more pic
tured their own scalps dangling at the
belt of a Piute, while their horses were
ridden by an Indian murderer. They
were sure they saw the footprints of
many Indian moccasins at the rear of
their houses: Indian faces rose before
them; the least noise startled them, and
sleep became Impossible. At last content
ed occupation of the station was out of
the question. So early one morning they
saddled. their horses, turned their backs
on Soda Lake and set their faces^toward
Camp Cady, -where a company of soldiers
was stationed.
â¢ Those unfortunates! who tried later to
keep- Soda Lake station have told strange
stories connected with the place-stories
of unearthly noises and groans about the
house, especially In the kitchen, and one
of these men, to-day living in the south-/
era part of the State, actually sweV-U
that the old kitchen was haunted by tAs
ghost of the murdered squaw, , jj ,
IN these days of full-fledged postmen
and express wagons it is not fair to
forget the hard workers of '43, who
paved the way for them. There was
the old Adams Company, there was
the pony express and the stage mail, and
there was Gregory's express.
A son of Pioneer Joseph W. Gregory
â¢was in the photographic business before
there were any photographs â when da
g-uerrotypes and ambrotypes still ob
tained. He treasures to this day a
daguerrotype of his father's express
wagon standing at the corner of Merchant
and Montgomery streets. ,Â«,
"That little old express wagon came j
around by way of Panama in '49," he says
proudly. "That's what my father used
to race the Adams Express with, Â«nd I
tell you when they got started it was nip
and tuck to see who'd be first to reach
the interior cities with the mail and news
for the papers."
He tells a story of a time when some
important Presidential news was expect
ed. It was to be carried from San Fran
cisco to Sacramento. The Adams Com
pany secured the only available boat for
the transportation of mail and express
matter up the river.
Gregory wasn't going to be beaten that
â¢way. He secured a small rowboat, got it
under the pier where he could converse
with the boatmen and bribed one of them
to pass the mail and express matter to
him through a hole. Having gained the
co\eted prize he made off for the capital
under the very nose of the guards and the
Adams Company's agent.
It was a hare and tortoise race. The
Adams Company, secure of their cinch,
took their time In going up the river.
Meanwhile â¢ Gregory was hurrying for
dear life, and the outcome was that the
news was published in Sacramento next
morning while the Adams people were
Etlll progressing leisurely up the river.
Both companies took desperate chances
time and again in their haste to deliver
dispatches. There were laws against fast
riding and driving, but on missions of
that kind little heed was paid to them.
On one occasion an officer standing in the
middle of the street attempted to stop one
of Gregory's messengers, but the horse
t:r.d rider were equal to the occasion. A
eecond'e halt and the officer lay sprawled
in the dust, while horse and rider leaped
over him and sped on their way.
Poor Gregory failed through the defal
cation of trusted agents in New York
City. He was burned out. too. in both
of the big fires of the early fifties, but
still he kept on with the express business
up to VÂ£l.
In September, 1SSS. an Innovation came
la the way of a transcontinental mail. It
was a stags ii. e connecting San Francis
co with St. Louis by way of Arizona*
Texas and Arkansas. Two stages each
week brought fresh fortune seekers and
Â¦the ever welcome mail. Californians be-
L'an to feel very near to the East with

in the days when they had been obliged
to depend upon the steamer?;
Most famous of all the old carrier sys
tems v.as the pony express, founded two
years laterâ that is. In 1SG0. 'Buffalo Bill
and no end of Indian adventures served
to make history of the pony express.
It was planned to be similar in every
way to the New England bi-weekly mail
of a half-century before. It was a. horse-
back mail sen-Ice from St. Joseph, Mo.,
the most western point then reached by
the Eastern railroads. St. Joseph could
be reached in an almost direct line from
Sacramento, the distance between the
two being about 1900 miles, which at an
average rate of eight miles per hour could
be covered in ten days.
SenStor Gwin induced a company to un-
dertake the matter. Arrangements were
made for stations along the line. At each
station a fresh horse was to be ready to
start on with the mail pouch. A rider,
commonly known as "Pony Bob." rode
on one occasion. 3S0 miles, completing the
trip in a little less than schedule time,
Another rider, ; William F. Cody, after-
ward famous as "Buffalo Bill." made one
continuous trip of 384 miles, stopping only
for meals and fresh horses. There were
to be two malls a week each way, and
the number of letters was necessarily llm-
ited to not more than 200 for each.rider.
Ordinarily the number ready for the post
fell far below the limit. The expensive
method of transportation necessitated a
high rate of postage, .the charge being $5
per ounce. To diminish weight letters
were written on lightweight paper, fre-
quently tissue. - Â¦ , \

been completed the pony express.left Sac-

the head of a", procession to the postoffice
amid music and cheers. :.
> The time was now shortened by the
pony express from twenty-one days to
ten, and this service was kept up until
superseded by transcontinental lines.
Among the requirements to equip the
pony express of yesterday were 500 horses,
190 stations, with 200 station-keepers and

The Board on Geographic Names made
last winter a special report on Filipino
nomenclature, concerning which the chart
makers were in some confusion. The gen
eral principle of the board seems to have
been to preserve as far as possible the
pure Spanish orthography, avoiding: the
modifications wrought in the original
names by English and American misspell
ing. ' The list now, published contains
about 4000 names of towns, rivers. . bays,
capes, mountains and other geographical
features of the new Philippine posses
sions. We observe that under W then
are only two names. Washington, a capÂ«.
and Weyler, a pueblo or townâ a some

The coast championship tournaments of
the last two weeks have been the most
successful in every way ever held 'here.
This success is greatly due to the pres
ence of the experts from Southern Cali
fornia, both women and men. . The former
proved that they were comparatively far
superior to the latter, as they carried all
before them with little or no difficulty,
while the men had to content' themselves
with but few honors. It is a remarkable
thing that the southern women should be
bo ' far superior to the ' local women ' and
the gentlemen of the south so outclassed
by the
It was thought previous to the doubles
tournament that Bell and Braley, the
southern champions in doubles, would win
the tournament with ease. The defeat of
tho latter In fthei r first match at the
hands of McGavin and Smith, the ulti
mate winners, came as a' great surprise.
The fact that the winners had never
played together In doubles previous to the
tournament speaks well for. their individ
ual skill. The smashing of young -Mc-
Gavin on the first day^pf the doubles was
easily as good as has*ever been seen on
the coast.
Bell is a tower of strength at the net,
where his overhead work is accurate and'
exceedingly strong, but his back court
strckes' are rather weak and erratic.
Of the four southern men, Sinsabaugh
has by far the most peculiar style. - His
volleying is very quick' and hard and his
drive' is awkward but effective.
Hendricks ' la probably the most promis
ing player of the four and will undoubt
edly be heard from in the future. Bra
ley's game Is very, similar to that of
Bell, but is hardly as good. He Is-bril
liant but erratic. * f .Â¦ â¢ -

ii over the usual channel course, the
yachts being divided into classes
according to their racing length. There
are classes ! for yachts having a racing
length of twenty feet or under, more
than twenty feet but not exceeding twen
ty-five feet, more than twenty-five but
not, exceeding thirty feet, -more than
thirty but not- exceeding thirty-six feet,
more than thirty-six but -not exceeding
forty- four feet, and more than forty- four
but not exceeding seventy feet. There
will also be a Bpeclal class for yawls hav
ing a racing length of thirty-six feet or
less, no allowance being made for the
rig.
The yachts will cross the line to a one
gun start in each class. The first yacht
in each class will win a silver cup, a
pennant and a certificate . of merit, while
the second yacht in each class will re-
celve a pennant and a parchment. 1 The
silver cup in' the twenty-foot class will be
presented by.i.Herbert E. Law, . an .Â¦ ex

The starting line will be between two
stakeboats anchored off Powell Btreet

For some time past It* has been the
custom for the yacht clubs to put one out
side -cruise on their annual programme, 1
but usually.no boats have taken it. This
year, however, the San Francisco and
California clubs have combined to make
a cruise to Drakes Bay. The yachts ren
dezvoused at Sausallto on* Friday even-
Ing and started out about 8 o'clock yes
terday morning on the ebb tide, expect
ing to make Drakes Bay in the after
noon. To-day one or two yachts which
were unable to start yesterday will drop
out on the. ebb tide. To-day will be spent
at Drakes "'Bay , In fishing and land
sports, and to-morrow the trip home will
be^made.: The /master of the gasoline
schooner 'Ida -A. which plies between Bo
ilnas and San'-. Francisco, has undertaken
to->look. % put /for .the yachts' to-morrow,
and If. he does not see them making their
way Â¦ down ' to the city, will run up to
Drakes Bay and give them a tow In.

be at their desks on Tuesday morning
will be 'sure of reaching San Francisco

California Yacht Club, who has made the
trip several times, says that the owners
will become enthusiastic about the cruise
when they have made it once.

The gentleman accepted and his subject
was raturally that of coursing. He re
viewed the hlrtory of the sport- on local
fields and told how interest In the game
had increased. He had, he said, watched
onursir.jr grow from an almost unpatron-
Jzed affair to a pastime in which the

vorabiy with the highest of other sports.

time so that he could be present at Eng

ing it he had dared to hope that some
Â«lzy a California greyhound would be sent
to compete in the stake and win Its much
coveted first honors.
The noticeable Improvement In the class
cY>Â£:s now in the running has caused
many enthusiasts to believe that Mr. Roa
ster's cherished ambition may be real
ized, and at r.o distant day.
The Futurity, which is being run to
day at Union Park, has on Its list ot en
tries a great collection of puppies, many
of which have already distinguished them
pelves at the game and against older per
formers of the top class.

irg lore speak highly of the ability of
r :he new dogs asd predict that their work
:h!s reason will show a great improve
ment over that of the star performers of

There are many Palo Altos among the
youngsters In the big stake, and it Is
freely prognosticated that they will equal
and even surpass the present day cham-
TP\OTJL, and quite early in the season, too.
The nominations for the Futurity of

by celebrated Herschel. Fiery Footsteps
Is by Fabulous Fortune, who is by Her

sented by the bÂ«st of England's cours'ngr
stock. Herschel has been bred to Green
tick bitches, but with no marked success,
but sens and grandsons have been bred to
daughters and granddaughters of Green
tick and the result has produced winners.
It is likely, though, that with the lau
rels of the rich stake to his credit the
winning owner will be only too anxious
to add the honors of a decision over the
crack unplaced youngster, and in that
event the coursing enthusiast will be
given a chance to see two great young

refusal to accept it would stamp the chal

Wrote With Both Hands at Once
Paris' New Craze of Leg Elongation
NOW that the possession of Titian
red hair has become so common as
to be no . longer remarkable or
"distingue," Parisian ladies have
ceased to dye their tresses to the required
shade. But another craze has arisen, and
to-day the one consuming desire of the
"petite Parisienne" is to add a few inches
to hor stature. For years she has been
trying to. do this by means of high heels
and those artful little contrivances. knowji
as "talonnettes," which when placed in
flo> her dainty shoes give her the benefit
of an extra centimeter. Now. thanks to
the clever discovery of a. fashionable
boulevard doctor, there is some hope "of
the diminutive fair one realizing her am
bition.
By means of an ingenious process by
â¢which the joints of the ankles and knees
are dally operated upon with an electric
bulb, the osseous matter at the sections of
the joints is expanded and the growth of
the bones stimulated, the consequence be
ing that the lhnbs are materially length
ened. The doctor also applies the bulb to
the spine, and he, says he is able to prove
by successful results already obtained on
patients whom he has "lengthened" that
he can add a ct-ntimeter (two-fifths of an
inch) per month during a period of six
months (1. e.. two and a half inches) to
the height of any cne submitting to his
treatment. After six months' continual
treatment the "expansion" is stopped for
a time and resumed later if necessary. :
Of course, the patient must be young
and supple, otherwise grave consequences
might follow the stretching of the Joints.
It is hardly necessary to add that the con
sulting rooms of the clever inventor -are
daily besieged by fair but dumpy ladles,

The, two of .'them, she' and her, father,
were growing great friends those days
over their "common interest; Bhe began to
accompany, him on h'ls stage trips. They
were monotonous and he liked to have the
little chatterbox on the seat beside him.
"Please let me drive a while," she used'
to big over and over. Â¦ . -
At Urst he would not let her touch the
lines. iEut uha -bpEEed so, hard that at
her, with hfa hand ready for any euiv.
gency, she had driven over every portion
of the route.
One day. her test came unexpectedly.
Her father was ill and could not make
the* trip. . .
. His stage carries the mall between
Uklah and Mendocino City, and a delay
might prove costly to him, as his contract
calls for a daily' trip between the two
points. What was to be done?
"I'll drive," Alice proposed,* calmly.
'â¢Â¦ "Youl" her father, cried. - "Suicide,
child! I'd as # soon see you drown your
self.;'", '. '. Â¦ . - " : ;-Â¦: .': -- ... :
But she argued with him quietly and
firmly, and in the end he gave in, as
people; usually do "when Alice wants her
own-way. He consented to let her drive
if he could lie in the bottom of the stase.
THE newest woman in Men<3oc!no
County is not a woman at all, but
I only a little li-year-cld girl, who
i doesn't try to be a man nor want
to be one. She has no ambitions
to drive men from pulpit or bench. She
dcetn't care a red cent for the ballot.
y She is entirely satisfied with being a stage
driver.
Which it an extremely "new" thing
to do, when you come to think of it.
Neither little girls, nor women, for that
matter, have been in the habit of driv
ing a four-horse stage over a precipit
ous mountain road where hold-ups are
casual. In fact a good many of the
ladies who are brave enough in their
demands fcr oquai privileges and do *
deal of roaring about being quite on a
par with man would take pretty quickly
to the protection of their husbands and
fathers and brothers and sons if they
were told that they had to drive that
Mendeclno County stage. Jt isn't bo
eaey to play the man under those cir
cumstances. But little 14-year-old Alice
Johnson iz net afraid.
Crack! Her whip swings out over the
horses. It decs not need to touch them.
They know who is behind it and thsy
obey. Rattle and rumble, and 'the stage
twir.gs wound narrow curves as neat
ly as if it moved on a track. Thunder
and bang, and down the steeps it roll3
with its brake as steady as the little
driver's head.
Alice J. Johnson cf Mendocino is the
wonder of her section of the county
Vand one of the wonders of the whole
county as well. Her fame is beliijj
spread by visitors to that portion of the
State. Â£he is tbe' younjest stage driver
in the worM, trnd a girl at that.
Only 14 years old, slender and non
masculine, t;he can pilot a four-horse
tcaxn with the skill of a veteran dnver.
Not cn'y ehe can. but she does. She Is
now engaged in thÂ« perilous occupation
of guiding four high etiung horses over
the steepest roAds uf the Â¦whole county.
Visitors marvel at her courage.
"However does she dare do it?" they
say.
"Hm! If you knew Johnson's little gal
you wouldn't thlnlt nothln* of it," the
old residents reply proudly.
"And however do people dare ride with
her?" the strangers usually continue.
The old residents enoct indignantly
when that queeticn arlres. "She's the
safest driver we know." they reply.
She is the idol of the community where
she lives. The old fellows who hang
out to watch the stage go by look on
adoringly at the way Â»she takes the
horses around intricate curves and down
BteÂ«-p grades with perfect nonchalance
and perfect surencss. It is more of a
boast with them than with her th^t ehe
J:as never in her whole career had a
Maigle mishap.
Nor a loss, either. For the bold and bad
highwayman turns gallant when he sees
the little whip, and holds up his hat in
stead of her passengers' hands while she
dashes by. She is known to the country
round as the Mascot.
This slight little prodigy Is a native ol
where he could be ready for any emer
gency. He -was so weak that he could
not have been of any use If trouble had
arisen, but he found seme satisfaction
in being present, so the family stowed
him away as comfortably as possible, and
the journey began.
At tirst Alec Johnson lay in the bottom
of the stage and fumed and fussed like a
grandmother. Then, as he felt the stage
going- smoothly on "and noticed Alices
calm confidence, he began to feel assur
ance, 'and at the end of half a dozen
, miles.- he fell asleep.
There were fifty mlle3 in all to make.
Three stops were made for change of
horsea, and at every stopping point the
people wsre startled by the appearance
of the little girl on the rfeat.
"Wai, ef that ain't Johnson's leetle gal

"Wai. I'll be "
Cheera broke forth and good wishe3
clamored in her ears and the drinks went

Whtn she reached there within the al
lotted nine hours she was given an ova

THE attempted assassination of
President McKinley has in a
great measure disturbed the plans
of the Native Sons of the Golden
West of " San Francisco, who for
months had been planning for the Admis
eion day celebration in San Jose. Out of
respect for the condition of President Mc-
Kinley the general committee of the or
der decided yesterday that the parade
which had been planned should not be of
the demonstrative character.
In view of this decision it was decided
to dispense with bands and fireworks and
to havfl the various parlors form accord
ing to arrangement and march along the
prescribed route to the San Jose depot, at
Third and 'iownsend streets, to the sound
of drums and bugles only. There were
many of those vho formed at the rendez
vous who felt that they would prefer to
remain at home because of their sympa
thy for President McKinley, but felt they
owed a duty to the Golden State to ob
serve Admission day, as in the past.
At 7 o'clock last night there was consid
erable activity around the headquarters of
the Native Sons on Mason street, and on
Geary and Post streets, where the several
parlors formed in divisions.

When the war with Spain broke out It

prepared of any of our coast defenses
for an encounter with an enemy. Now It
is revealed that there was not a single
gun at Fort Wadsworth which was ready
to be fired for three weeks after the offi
cial declaration of the existence of a state
of war. With all the experience of the
past three years, however, we are still
as negligent as we were in the old peace

not one of the forts of the Atlantic coast
defenses has enough ammunition on hand

A statement going to show the marvel
ous increase in the use of postal facilities
by the American people is that of .the
director of the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing at Washington, just issued, in
which it appears that the number of post
age stamps -sent out for use during- the
current fiscal year includes 1,300,000,00!) one
cent stamps. 3,500,000,000 two-cent stamps
and 309,236,000 of higher denominations/
The total, including special-delivery ten
cent stamps, is 5.116,236,000. against 4 377 -
727,000 for the previous fiscal vear. an
increase of over one and a half billion
stamps. It is not easy to grasp the full
significance of these stupendous totals. A
few calculations may help. According to
these figures stamps will be Issued this
year , to supply every man, woman and
child' in the United States with at least
sixty stamps each. Distributed among
the population of the entire globe they
would supply each person with postage for
not less than three letters. Placed side
by side in a continuous line the total
issue would girdle the entire earth three
times, forming a variegated ribbon around
it nearly three inches in width. If spread
out in the same manner across the United
States the stamps would form a paper
sidewalk from New York to San Francisco
over three feet wide. Pasted into a stamp
collector's book of the conventional size,
the issue for the year would fill half a
million volumes, which, 'placed one upon
another, would form a. solid column over
twenty-five miles high. If it is true, as

TUCSON, Ariz.. Sept. 7.--Four cow
punchers, who engaged in a gunflght at
Antelope Pass, in Graham County, a few
days ago. are dead, and one man who wit
nessed the fight carries a bullet Imbed
ded in the bone of his heel. It was the
most remarkable fight that has taken
place In Arizona In many years.
Jesse Hoffman and his brother Hayden,
Â¦who is known by the cowboys as "Push
"Wadley," were at their camp eating a
Tratermclon, when Kavare Sanchez, a
JMexiCÂ£n cowboy, approached them and
grabbed a piece of the melon. This an
grered Jesse Hoffman, who knocked the
Mexican down. Sanchez vowed venge
ance, but said he did not care to fight
with his fists.
"You waitâ I come and fight you," he
eaid as he left.
Eancnez went after his partner. Benito
Canales, and the two then returned, well
armed, to take up the fight of Sanchez.
"When they got within fifty yards Jesse
Hoffman told Sanchez that he .had better
etop there, but the two Mexicans ad
vanced, unmindful of the warning.
"Don't come up here or I'll kill you,"
Â¦warned Hoffman, drawing his Eix
ehooter.
Sanchez did not halt, but Instead rushed
on Hoffman, and the latter fired. Sanchez
struck up*Hoffman'6 revolver and the ball
went Into the air.
Hayden Hoffman then came to the as
eistance of his brother and opened Ore.
which was returned by both Sanchez and
his partner. Hayden Hoffman was killed
and Jesse fought the two men for a few
minutes, killing Canales and falling, him
self mortally wounded, at the feet of
Sanchez.
The sole survivor of the fight then
mounted his horse and had gone fifty
yards when Jesse Hoffman, who was
dying, raised his body, secured his six
ehooter and fired at the retreating Mexi
can. The bullet struck Sanchez squarely
in the head, killing him instantly, and his
body was dragged several hundred yards
by his horse before it fell to the ground.
Fifteen ehots had been fired, ten of
â¢which took effect. The marksmanship of
Jesse Hoffman is regarded as remarkable
for one mortally wounded and breathing
out his last moments of life. He was
married and a widow and child survive
him, but his brother was unmarried.
A man named Brown, who keeps a sa
loon in Antelope Pass, was present dur
ing the fight and received a bullet in his
heel, which a surgeon could not extract.
bo firmlv Â¦was it Imbedded. Officers Â¦went
to the scene of the fight, but as every
participant had been killed there was no
one left to arrest.
Another killing took place soon after
ward In Hay Canyon during a round-up
on the Stockton ranch. Joe Grammer
Killed the camp cook, named. Burris. He
claimed that Burris fired at him as he
was leaving camp and he was compelled
to shoot in self-defense. Grammer was
held to the Grand Jury in $20,000 bail, as
he attempted to escape after shooting

The police of Seattle testify that
O'Brien always was mean and fierce,
save when he feigned insanity for a pur
pose. O'Brien himself, in his own docu
ments produced here, acknowledges hav
ing once been in jail In England for mur
der.
J. P. Hughes says he knew O'Brien in
Schuyler, Neb., eight years ago; that he
often was In Jail there for various treach
erous deeds and that the Sheriff of the
county declared him the only man he
feared, O'Brien, Hughes says, then had
a wife and a small boy with him and
claimed to have "come from England by
the way of Chicago.- When last seen -he
was in jail there. He broke out and trace
of him was lost. Â¦Â¦'-.Â¦Â¦
Father Gendreau preached on August
26 upon a theme fitted to the case of
O Brlen, but passed over his encounter
â¢with the murderer with a few words.
The father did not attend the hang
ing of O'Brien, as he probably
would have done had it not been for
the fcuil attack, but during the execution
the priest remained at home and prayed
for the man to turn penitent. His pray
ers availed naught, for O'Brien died curs
ing everything and everybody to the last,
and with nerves of steel and not the sign
of emotion or fear.
SEATTLE, Sept. 7.â It has 'developed
since the hansing,of George O'Brien, the
murderer of Lynn Relfe of Seattle, that
he behaved far more ferociously while
under the death guard than was then
made public and that he even assaulted
the Rev. Father Peter Gendreau. the
priest who waited upon him to minister
to hie spirUual wants. Several days be
fore he was hanged, O'Brien took advan
tage of the opportunity, when the guards
withdrew slightly to leave him alone with
his spiritual adviser, and like a blood
thirsty beast sprang upon the aged
father, siezed him by the throat and was
throttling him when the guards heard the
scuffle, rushed in and took the desperate
fellow away. The marks of the murder
er's hands were left upon the father's
throat/ .

Special Dispatch to The Call:
: STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 7.â
Treasurer John T. Nourse of the Associ

faculty committee on students'- affairs
that he cannot longer hold his position,

university for,' deficiency in scholarship.

that all college athletics may be stopped,
since the committee declares positively
that they shall not proceed under
Nourse's direction, and. Nourse has all the

Chairman Green wrote to President Me-
Cormlck. of the Associated Students and
asked him to call a meeting of the execu
tive committee of the Associated Students
to appoint" a successor to' Treasurer
Nourse. Part of Professor Green's com
munication follows: - , -
Mr. Nourse 'was suspended by the committee
on scholarship at the end of last semester. The
committee on students' affairs promptly called
Mr. Nourse's' attention to the policy of sev
eral years' standing, which forbids students
under suspension from taking active part In
student affairs, and informed him that the
committee could. not consent to his continuance
in office while under suspension. The proper
officials of the Associated Students also were
Informed officially of the situation in order .that
they might take any action necessary in the
premises:-' As the time until commencement
wa3 very limited, the student body and its of
ficers had no adequate opportunity to deal with
the matter. In order that- the -business -might
not be neglected during the vacation, to the
detriment of the Associated Students. Dr.
Branner authorized Mr. Nourse to serve until
the university should open in September,. before
which date it was Impossible for the Associated
Students to act. â¢ ' 'Â¦
The case was reviewed upon September 3 by ,
the entire committee on students' affairs and \
the' unanimous conclusion reached that- no -i
change in the former action should be made.
Very truly yours. Â¦' T* R. L- GREEN,
Chairman Committee .on Students' Affairs.
Treasurer Nourse declares his intention
of holding hie position and in justification
he made the following statement when
seen this afternoon:
According to the new amendment to the con
stitution of tbe Associated Students my duties
as treasurer began on September 1. The only
requirements of the amendment were that the
treasurer should be a graduate who had studied
three years at Stanford. Those requirements :
I fulfill and the committee on students' affairs
agreed to that amendment, which was passed
on March" 13. Professor Gilbert, chairman of i
the scholarship committee, had told me that
if an amendment were passed -providing that
the treasurer need not be a student, his com
mittee would not take action against me in
case of deficiency in scholarship. - On the 29th
of' March I petitioned this committee to be
allowed to drop all college work In order to
take up my duties as treasurer and this peti
tion was approved by my Instructors. At the
same time I quit attending classes. Before the
nomination of officers for the Associated StUr
dents on April 19 Professor Green, chairman of
the students' affairs committee, required
President Marrack of the student body to hand
in the names of candidates for the treasurer
ship. My name was handed in and approved by
the committee. On May 31 the committee on
scholarship reported my work as unsatisfactory
and suspended me for one semester. Professor |
Angell, chairman of the faculty committee on
athletics, wrote me on June 9 that after con
ferring with Dr. Branner, acting president of
the university, he had decided it would be
most practicable to the carrying out of the
treasurer's duties that I should continue in the
office during the summer. Â¦ Dr. Jordan told me
that <the rule requiring student body officials
to meet certain scholarship i requirements, was
Intended to make bona* fide students, of those
pretending to be students. I am not registered
for work, nor do I. pretend to be a student.

The Los Angeles Herald, reviewing the

is a continued reduction in new work with
an Increase In the number of new wells.
The Herald says:
In summarizing the work in the oil fields of

portant ixalnts to chronicle. -Work has been
at a standstill almost in several fields, ' tÂ£ouj;n
it ig now at the turning point and something;
of a revival of work is looked for: The com

THE football season Is on and the

Berkeley team, has begun the task of
whipping a team into shape that may or
may not bring victory to the blue

ing assisted by "Jimmy": Hopper and
within a few weeks many of the old foot
baH men will return to their alma mater
to assist in . bringing .the team up to- a
winning standard. Â¦ . , . ..
Dr. Simpson was a star ; tackle in his
day. He made the - Varsity In '95-96 and
'97, In 1S98 he was chosen. coach by the
Oregon University and had the/satisfac
tion of seeing that eleven win the inter
collegiate championship during that and

sist him, played quarter and end for the

The head coach discussed the prospects
of freshmen and Varsity elevens yester
day. He was pleased to say that there,
was plenty of good material and - there
was every indication that the college
would put forth two elevens that would
bring success to their university.
Dr. Simpson Is delighted with the spirit
manifested, by the student body, which,
he says, means half. the battle. "It is the
intention of the eleven to win every game
they go into," said the coach. "We hope

victories to our credit. We have done very
little work. I believe In giving the men
lig-ht work at the outset of the season.
The. trouble has always been, that the
football candidates have done too much
playing at the start and this has had a
tendency to* take all the snap out of them
and make them grow stale. We are going
to try and avoid that thl3 year.
"We have eight of last year's Varsity
.men and we -have' divided them Into
squads. The ends are coaching ends, the
tackles are teaching the green material
the inner points of the game and the oth
er veterans are doing likewise. . The fresh
man material as a whole looks good. More
or less have played on preparatory school
teams, but none come with great reputa
tions, which is better for all concerned.
If a man is big, strong, Â»fast, willing and
heady he is better than a man who comes
to college thinking he knows pretty near
ly as much as the veterans.
"We expect great things from our men.
We have in Walter Christie a trainer who
thoroughly understands his -work and who
is well liked by the men. The first game
of the season will be played on Septem
ber 28. We will have the first line-up prob
ably-a week or ten days before the game.
We will play good, straight football. Of
course the team will have a few trick
plays, but it is my belief that no team can
carry out a trick, unless it has the ability
of playing straight- football. While we
have many old players with us. they are
not certain of places onthe eleven! ' Every
man-must try for his position, and it will
be a case of the best man winning out."
Among the veterans who will probably
play -on this year's eleven are: "Wreck"

new smelter at San Diego is almost ready
to receive ore. The masonry work is done,
the iron stack which goes up above the
masonry chimney Is yet to be put In place".
The capacity of the furnace Is. claimed to
be from thirty to fifty tons of iron daily,
according to the ore used. The smelting
will be done by the radiation of heat and
not by direct application to the ore itself.
The Union says that the furnace is only
a small part of the plant which will be
eventually built. As soon as the demon
stration-Is made that the best of iron can
be' supplied with this furnace work will
begin on a" plant capable of producing
from 400 to 500 tons of iron a day.
Growing out of the large sweepstake
deal in Trinity County are benefits to con
tractors of various kinds. The sum of
$35,000 . goes to one contractor for haul
ing in between 1000 and 1200 tons of freight.
The same contractor, William M. Welsh,
has also a contract for hauling to the
Bully Hill mine, from which, according
to the Redding Free Press, he received
from $S0O0 to $10,000 per month. '
Contractors Reap Profits.
A mineral map of. Inyo County has been
completed in the drafting department of
the State Mining Bureau. The State Min
eralogist will have a inineral map, with
accompanying register, prepared for each
mineral producing county in the State,
the same to be revised yearly as develop
ment .progresses. Each .mine producing
mineral deposits is located as accurately*
as possible on the map with a number,
and the register furnishes a description
of the same, with information, of a gen
eral character. The Mineralogist has sent
out a circular letter referring to this mat
ter, in which he says: â¢
Some changes will be made in the character
cÂ£ the registers, which it is hoped will -be an
improvement on those, previously Issued. A
plain statement of facts will be Kiven and all
mines, will be treated alike, , as under this sys
tem- it will.be impossible to "boom" or- favor
one property more than another... The Miner
alogist has instructed his assistants .to furnish
facts and . not theories, . so ," that any literature
that may. be iesued by: the bureau, will , be ac
curate and beyond question. .. ' ; . . \ .
Â¦ Tho Pioche Consolidated Mining Com
pany, which owns practically all the min
ing property at Pioche, Nev., is about to
resume active work.
The Redding Free Press says that the
Moore group of mines,' next to the Bully
Hill mine, .has been sold to a company of
Leadville, Col., people for $8000.
The Trinity Journal hears that the Al
toona quicksilver mine at Cinnabar, Trin
ity County, which has been working for
several years, will soon suspend opera
tions. The management has taken the
water pump from the mine and has dis
continued taking in fuel.
The Stockton Independent says that the
dredger to be installed upon the Oalave
ras Itiyer to rescue gold lrom the bottom
and sio.es of that strearn will have a large
field for operations. The projectors have
secured nearly all the rights from the
poinz near Jenny Â«L.inc to a place near
Hunts Landing, this area being . nearly
three miles long. The <:alavcras Prospect
is of opinion t'nat this particular section
of tho Calaveras River ought to prove
very profitable for: dredge mining, as
many of the tributary streams li-iad in
the rich gravel and placer claims â¢ on
either side of the river. - ..:....

The sale price In San Francisco has been as
high as $118 55 and as low as $26 25 per nasic.
The present price Is $46 to $47. Up to the close
of 1S99 the 1,831,022 flasks produced probably
sold for $88,000,000. In 1887 Oregon was credited
with a product of sixty-five flasks. There are
a number of deposits there. More recently a
deposit of. this ore has been found in Nevada,
but whether of sufficient value to be worked
is not known. In 1893 there was a deposit
reported discovered at Terllngua, Tex., which,
it is claimed, has yielded about 1O0O flasks.
: These assistants will begin this month
to -examine the various deposits and con
struction work for the purpose of gath
ering data for the forthcoming bulletin.
Some companies have declined to . accede
to this request. The Mineralogist says
that all Information wlil be treated with
the strictest, confidence by the bureau. It
is his intention to obtain information of
Â§ general character which will aid and
e of practical value to the miners
throughout the State,
i California has furnished nearly all the
quicksilver produced in the United States,
and there, are twelve counties In the State
where quicksilver . deposits have ' been
found, these being Coiusa, Lake, Napa,
San Benito, Santa Clara. San Luis Obis
po, Sonoma,. Trinity, Monterey Mendo
cino. Huinboldt and Siskiyou. The Min
ing and Scientific Press says that Califor
nia quicksilver mines have produced in a
half-century 1.831,022)fiasks of quicksilver.
The same paper furnishes the following
facts:
.. The first step toward securing informa
tion nece&sary for. the bulletin to be'is
sued by the State Mining Bureau relative
to the quicksilver resources of the State
has been taken. The State Mineralogist
has during tlie past week addressed let
ters to the owners 6r superintendents of
all the :produr;lng quicksilver mines, re
questing them to give the field assistants
of the State Mining Bureau acces3 to
Â¦their mines.

KEEP YOUR BLOOD GLEANThe steamer Umatilla, which Is sched
uled to sail from this port to-day, will get
away on time. There were more teams
hauling freight to Broadway dock, where
she Is berthed, yesterday than have been
seen on the front for many days. At 2
o'clock in the afternoon a long line oÂ£
heavily laden drays, extending from tha
chief wharfinger's office to the Broadway
dock, awaited an opportunity to get on tho
wharf to unload the freight consigned to
the Umatilla., - Â¦ . - Â¦-â¢ -
The steamers George .TV. Elder and Co
lumbia, which shortly after the com
mencement of the strike were laid up at
Portland by the Oregon Railroad and Nav
igation Company are to be put back on
the route, and within a few days will com
mence making - their regular trips. Tho
officials of the company feel confident
that laboring men and sailors enough to
load and man the vessels can now be se
cured.; The Elder is expected to arrlvo
here September 10.
The steamer Coronado got away for
Grays Harbor with a full non-union crew.
The Coronado was one of the llrst vessels
tied up by the strike. She was fully load
ed several days ago, but could not get out
until yesterday because of the scarcity of
sailors. The steamer Robert Dollar suc
ceeded in getting away for Seattle, man
ned with non-union sailors, after belnx
tied up here for more than four weeks.
A number of vessels cleared at the Cus
tom-house yesterday and -will probably
sail to-day. They were the steamers San
Jose for Panama, Umatllla for Victoria
and the Pomona for Eureka. The bark
Amy Turner for Hilo and the German ship
Wandsbeck also cleared.
More than 500 union men joined the
ranks of the strikers yesterday, notwith
standing that on the vessels on which
they came into port special inducements
were offered them to remain with tho
ships. Ten vessels of the salmon fleet ar
rived and their crews quit them aa soon
as they had dropped anchor. These men
will pay quite a sum into the strike fund,
as they are all in arrears for dues, which
they usually pay at the end of each fish
ing season.

Desired Conference Not Granted.
On September 7 your committee received its
final answer from the board of directors of thÂ«
Employers' Association, which reply reads aa
follows: Â¦ -
"SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 7. 1901.
"Peter J. Curtis, Esq., Chairman Committee
Board of Supervisors, New City Hall, San
Francisco: Dear Sir â The board of directors of
the Employers' Association, after a. careful
consideration of your communication of Sep
tember 2. 1901. have instructed me to advise
you that it is their unanimous opinion that the
conference suggested in your letter would under
existing conditions be inadvisable.
"The vital principle involved In the present
controversy is that of non-interference Â» by
labor unions or their representatives with the
conduct of the business of employers. No ques
tion of hours or wages is involved directly or
indirectly. The present controversy between
the Draymen's Association and the Brotherhood
of Teamsters arose from an unlawful attempt
on the part of the employes to dictate as to the
persons for whom their employers should do
business. In the attempt to support this en
tirely untenable position, the teamsters have by
means of the so-called sympathetic strike
caused employes In other branches of industry
to violate the obligations of contract and to
plunge the city and the State Into an Industrial
warfare which has seriously affected the means
of livelihood of thousands of innocent persons.
The principles thus involved may be surren
dered by the employer, but it cannot be com
promised, and the members of the Employers'
Association believe that a. surrender of the
principle would be the beginning of the end of
San Francisco's industrial welfare.
"The members of the Employers' Association,
while distinctly applauding the attitude of the
draymen in this controversy, are nevertheless
not active participants in the struggle, although
their Interests, like those of others, have been
affected thereby. Ever since the strike began
the association has been, for the most part,
occupied and concerned with the problem ot
enabling its members and the other merchants
of this city to carry on their business In the
normal fashion. They have been endeavoring
to maintain the right of peaceable citizens to
move freely throughout the city without fear
of Intimidation or violence. Not being parties
to any of the existing labor contests, they have
nothing to compromise and nothing to arbi
trate. They are standing simply upon their
rights as American citizens, and they will re
sist to the utmost any and all attacks upon
those ,right3. '
"As the question of interference by labor
unions or their representatives Is thus the ex
clusive issue In. the present controversy, every
thing else being non-essenflal and of minor im
portance, "it is plain that a conference such as
Is suggested by you would be entirely futile
and barren of results. It would end as it be
gan and would serve no purpose whatsoever,
save, . perhaps, to inspire In the minds of those
actively engaged In the struggle the delusive
hope of some settlement of the present un
fortunate conditions, and its only result, there
fore, would be to . prolong the contest Instead
of ending It. - ...-.-â¢.-
"The Employers',, Association has never been
and Is not now opposed to conferences between
the employer and his employes. On the con
trary, they have always approved of such con
ferences, and believe them the only legitimate
way in which differences between the Individual
employer and his employes can be satisfactorily
adjusted.' If your committee can arrange for
any such conference I am instructed to assure
you of the hearty support of this association
in every attempt made by you In that direc
tion. Very truly yours,
â¢ , s . "M. - F. MICHAEL."
Employers' Position Untenable.
-Your 'committee â¢ submits to Â¦ this honorable
board that the position of the Employers' As
sociation as expressed to Its officers Is an ab
solutely untenable one. While . your commit
tee does not attempt to pass upon the other
questions at Issue between the Employers' As
sociation and the labor unions it expresses In
unqualified terms, Its sanction- of the right of
the .representatives of the labor unions to meet
the representatives of the. Employers' Associa
tion in conference. ' ;' {
Your committee, -as can be Inferred from Its
written utterances set forth above, is of the
firm conviction Ahat the. gravity, of the eco
nomic issues Involved 'In the controversy and
the vast significance of the proper solution of
those issues "to the happiness of a larffe pro
portion of. our community demand that they be
explolted'by a direct conference between the
representatives of the contending parties with
out the interference of any intermediary. .Re

"We pointed out to .you at out conference
that we believed" that public sentiment was
crystallizing, against your organization and we
confirm' our statements then made to you that
that public sentiment is not abating. We do
not hold over your heads as a menace the ex
istence of an - antagonistic public sentiment,
but we Doint' to that sentiment to . convince
you that' your course- is wrong.-. The. public
sentiment is not based upon the outcries of
either party, but is the intelligent view of the
situation of the disinterested .element of Ithe
community. That SBntiment cannot be ignored
because it Is widespread and prevails among
all elements of our community.
. "We as officials of this community urge you
as public-spirited and- wise ' citizens of 'this
community, interested in the preservation of
Its commercial prosperity and fair, name, not
to let so small a matter as a conference be
tween-your organization and the representa
tives of the labor unions stand In the way of
a possible termination of the present labor
troubles. We appeal to you, not as advocates
of labor unions, not as advocates of any side
of the issue, for with- those matters we feel
that we* have , at the present time no right to
interfere, but solely as advocates of the right
of audience and conference, as advocates ever
of the sacred right to be heard.
â¢ "Whether or not a labor union- has a right
to treat, with your organization the way of
exacting articles of understanding or agree
ment is a matter 'that we do not touch upon
now. In the present inflamed condition of. the
mind of the community it- Is not easy to
secure a cool, calm and fair determination of
that issue. That - Issue we believe can safely
be le't to a future time when the labor ex
citement and the turmoil of strikes are not
raging. ' â¢ ' Â¦
'"You say that they shall riot interfere with
your relations to your employes; that you will
not submit to, their dictation In those relations.
In answer to that, and 113 advocates for neither
party, but in the interests of the community,
we say that the right of conference is not an
interlerence nor a dictation In your affairs. You
have already expressed your willingness that
they should meet your attorney, M. P. Michael,
and you have already presented various articles
that, you are willing to abide by in your atti
tude toward these unions. We say that al
though you deny that Mr. Michael was to meet
them as your representative, and insist that he
was to meet them only as your attorney and ad
.viser, that we are not equal Â¦ to - the metaphys
ical distinction that you insist upon. Â¦ If he was
to meet them as your attorney and adviser, he
was to meet them in a representative capacity.
You have already therefore In our humble judg
ment expressed a willingness to. meet the rep
resentatives of the organizations, through Mr.
Michael, a representative. They ask only one
further concessionâ that . is, that they meet the
immediate representatives of your body; that
there be no intermediary ! between them and
you. We do not ask for them that you make
any articles with them, articles even of the
kind that you yourselves have submitted to
them. We ask only that they be given the op
portunity for peaceable conference with you;
that this opportunity . for - a way out of our
present troubles be not neglected. .In our judg
ment you have already treated with these unions
and we say it is less for you to meet them than
to treat with them, and we ask now not that
you treat with- them but that you meet them.
"We are of the opinion, though our opinion
Is no certainty, but one based, upon what we
believe to be reasonable inference, from our
conference with the leaders of the labor or
ganizations, that if the conference resulted In
nothing more than the mutual expression of
good will toward each organization the.pres
ent strike would end.
or pledge yourselves to any course of action to
ward them. We ask at this time only that you
grant them the right of audience, to. present to
you the cause of- the labor unions, and of the
members thereof, who constitute a very consid
erable proportion of our community. We are of
the conviction that if this right is granted to
them, this right of meeting you in open, fair
and genuine conference, a very decided advance
will have been made in the direction of the so
lution of the difficulties. : . â¢
MEASURED by positive results,
the settlement of the strike -is
no nearer than two days ago,
if. Indeed, as near as It seemied
to be then. The terms' of peace ;
proposed by the committee from the Mu
nicipal Federation of Improvement Clubs
Is still under consideration by the execu
tive committee of the Draymen's Associa
tion, but the efforts of the conciliation
committee of the Board of Supervisors
have resulted in complete failure..
The Employers' Association, through
its attorney, sent its final reply yesterday
to the request of the Supervisors commit
tee that a direct conference be granted
the representatives of the labor | unions.
The request was denied In unequivocal
terms, and the committee has given out
for publication a full report of its ertorts,
which is given below.
George Renner, manager of the Dray
men's Association, said yesterday that
the executive committee considered at its
morning meeting the terms ot peace laid
before it by the Improvement Clubs peo
ple, but that no action was taken, nor
would any action be taken to-day or to
morrow. He said that after the double
holiday interim there might be results
and that the prospects for a settlement
seemed- brighter.
The beliet is quite generally entertained
that the draymen will consent to recog
nize the Brotherhood of Teamsters in
questions relating to hours and wages
and that Tuesday will see the beginning
of the end. The representatives of the
labor unions are anxious to have inserted
in the terms of peace this particular form
of recognition, as the teamsters fear that
the draymen will cut wages in the effort
to make good the losses occasioned by the
strike. The draymen say- they have no
intention of doing so, as they are satis
fied to let wages and hours stand as un
der the old agreement.

Conciliation Committee Records Story
The conciliation committee of the Board
of Supervisors records the failure of its
efforts in the following report, which will
be submitted to the board Tuesday night:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San FranciscoâGen
tlemen: Under the provisions of resolution N r o.
1817, adopted at a meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors held on August 12. 1901, a special
committee was appointed by his HoDor the
Mayor, charged with the duty of bringing
about a conference between the representatives
of the Employers' Association and of the labor
unions and to take such other means as the
committee might deem wise to effect a ter
mination of the present labor difficulties.
The committee appointed by his Honor the
Mayor was constituted of Supervisors P. J.
Curtis, Joseph S. Tobin, Henry U. Branden-
Etein. Charles Boxton and L. J. Dwyer.
The committee so appointed now submits to
this honorable board the following report:
Your committee determined . that in the be

issues to outline its course of proceeding.
Your committee therefore Invited the repre

at different hours of the same day, to wit, on
the 26th day of August.
Your committee sent the representatives of
the unions and cf the Employers' Association

THE officers of the Harbor Police
station resorted to strategy last
'night to find out if the acts of
violence committed on the front
; . were done by union 'men, and
found that, the pickets stationed along
the front were in some cases at least the
ones-who committed the assaults.
Ofticer Pat Herlihy, wearing the clothes
of a sailor and made up as a water-front
roustabout, walked up and down East
street for several hours, putting himself
in the way of the union pickets. Several
times pickets stopped himrand asked him
if he were at work along the front. Her
lihy replied that he was and named a
dock where it was known that non-union
men were employed. Hardly would his
answer be given when he would be sur
rounded and attacked, and if he had not
been, armed he would have joined the
ranks of the men sent to the Harbor Hos
pital. .As it was, Herlihy's club played
an Important part in all the .scrimmages,
and pickets and union men to the nymuer
of eight' were placed under arrest. Lieu
tenant Price and Sergeant Blank trailed
Herlihy on his Â¦ rounds and prevented his
being overpowered by numbers.
The fact that the other officers on duty
along the front were not informed of the
ruse cost Herlihy a clubbing at the hands
of his fellow officers. He was accosted at
the corner of Kast and Mission street by
a picket, who on being informed by Her
lihy that he was "scabbing" started to
beat him. Several other union men joined
in the attack and 'the disguised officer had
his hands full warding off their vicious
blows. Lieutenant Price arrived or> the
scene and commenced using his club. (71
ticers Edna and McGowan saw the mix
up and came running to the aid of the
lieutenant and not knowing that Herlihy,
disguished as a longshoreman, was in the
crowd plied their clubs indiscriminately.
Edna centered" his attack on the roughly
dressed individual who was armed with
a club and managed to raise several welts
on Herlihy's back and shoulders before
he recognized him.
One of the men arrested through the
ruse of the officers, Henry C. Johansen,
carried a revolver and was charged at the
Harbor station with carrying a concealed
weapon. The other seven were John

row and hope to be able to send you a reply
not later than that date. Yours very truly,
"M. F. MICHAEL.."
Thereafter, on the 28th day of August. 1901,
at the hour of 1 p. m., at the office of Joseph
a. Tobin, at the Hibernla Bank building, your
committee met Messrs. A. Furuseth, Michael
Casey and E. R. Rosenberg and secured from
them a statement of their side of the contro
versy. They at that time expressed the stiong
est desire for a conference between then 1 or
any other representatives of the unions and the
representatives of the Employers' Association.
After a conference extending over some time
and proper deliberation, your committee' con
cluded that the main object of its efforts
should be to secure a' conference between the
representatives of the two bodies.
Your committee determined that It was not
its proper province at that time to go into
the details of the basis of settlement of the
matters In dispute, but that its sole function
then was to secure the conference stated. .
Your committee believed at that time Its
function was not to espouse the cause of either
side, not to inject Into the controversy the
opinion of the committee as to the rights of
the contending parties, but to bring about a
meeting of the bodies that by friendly confer
ence and discussion the difficulties might be
allayed. - . ., â¢"'
The committee was of the absolute convic
tion that nothing could be achieved unless the
representatives of the two contending parties
were brought face to face in open conference:
that the definite formulation of demands and
counter demands must be postponed until that
conference.
Your committee, with that end In view, de
termined that the proposition for a conference
must be laid not before the attorney or .legal
adviser of the Employers' Association, but be
fore the immediate representatives of that"
body. ?
On August 29. 1901, your chairman received
a telephonic communication from Mr. . M. F.
Michael, asking the chairman to meet Mr.
Michael at his office at 3 o'clock of that day
and at the hour named the chairman of your
committee called at the office of Mr. Michael
and had an extended conversation with him.'
At that interview Mr. Michael stated that'
the request of the committee to meet the rep
resentatives of the Employers' Association
would be denied, but that he himself was au
thorized to give any Information concerning
the controversy which the committee might
dtsire to have. Mr. Michael explained at
length to the chairman the position of the Em
ployers' Association . throughout the contro
versy.
The chairman stated that at this time hf:
would not discuss the merits of the contro
versy; that the committee was charged with
the duty of bringing about a 'conference be
tween the parties and for that purpose he
deemed it necessary that the committee should
meet the representatives of the association.
Employers Consent to a Meeting.
Mr Michael stated that this matter had been
gone' Into so many times by different concil
iatory committees that he could not see that
an Interview would be of any avail. He dis
claimed any intention to show disrespect to
the committee of the Board of Supervisors and
that he was of the belief that no good could
come from any further discussion, but, out of
respect for the committee and Its official mis
sion he would lay the matter before the rep
resentatives of the Employers' Association and
that he would advise the chairman on the fol
lowing mbrnintr as to whether or not the con
ference would be granted.
After the chairman's interview with Mr.
Michael, on the same day, the 'committee was
reconvened and at that meeting the chairman
reported In full the interview he had had with
Mr. Michael. . -
The committee after some deliberation caused
a communication to be sent, to Mr. Michael, as
secretary of the Employers' Association, which
communication read as follows: 'â¢ â¢ U Â¦ i

"Chairman of the Committee."
After the receipt of that communication Mr.
Michael telephoned on the following day to
the chairman of the committee that a com
mittee of the Employers' Association would be
prepared to meet this committee at 11 o'clock
of the morning of the 31st day of August, 1 1S01;
with the understanding that the meeting would
be held in executive session. Â¦ -
The chairman of the committee then wrote,
so that there would be no mistake as to time
and place of meeting, the following letter to
Mr. Micheel:
"M. F. Michael Esq., Secretary of the Em
ployers' Association, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir:
I will notify my committee to be present at
the office of Joseph S. Tobin. at the Hibernla
Bank building, to-morrow morning, August 31,
1901. at 11 o'clock. I presume "it will be agree
able to both committees to meet there, which
is the usual place of meeting for conference
by the committee. Very truly,
"PETER J. CURTIS."
Purpose of Committee Stated. Â¦
On the presentation of. this letter by the clerk
of the committee to Mr. Michael, Mr. Michael
said that he had notified the chairman that
they desired to have the meeting- at his own
oflice. As the place of meeting was of minor
importance and the actual meeting of vital im
portance the chairman of the committee upon
receipt of this message advised Mr. Michael
by telephone that the committee would be on
hand at his office at the hour named.
Your committee met the committee of the
Employers' Association on the following day
at 11 o'clock at the office of Mr. Michael. Be
fore the conference was formally begun your
committee requested that It be informed how
far It was desired that the proceedings should
be executive. Your committee stated 'that as
it was constituted- of public 'officials, charged
with a public duty and under an obligation to
report publicly all Its", transactions it mast
give all the proceedings of the conference.
Your committee' after this statement was
asked to withdraw temporarily- for the pur
pose of enabling the members of the commit
tee of the Employers' Association to deliberate
before giving their answer. Your committee
thereupon withdrew and in a few minutes
thereafter .was invited to return to the session
and was informed that the committee of the
Employers' Association would agree -that the
proceedings should be reported in full, but that
they desired the names of the committee to be
withheld from publication.
Your committee expressed itself as satisfied
with that arrangement, and the conference be
gan.
Your committee represented that the object
of the meetine was to secure if possible an
amicable settlement of the. labor difficulties,
And in order to accomplish that end your com
mittee deemed It necessary that there should
be a conference between' the representatives of
the Employers' Association and the. labor
unions, that, the two contending elements, or
organized wealth and organized labor, . might
meet in open, fair and free discussion and con
ference.
Your committee further stated that it did not
occupy the position of advocate of either side;
that it was offering no plan of compromise or
agreement, but asked only that a conference be
held for the purpose of arriving, if possible, at
some decisive agreement. ;
No Becognitiori ; for .Unions.
Your committee insisted strongly that the Is
sue involved was of vast ecoqmnic importance,
touching the very life and happiness of ! a
great proportion of the community, i .The posi
tion of the Employers' Association was there
upon expressed by Its representatives to be that
the Employers'- Association,' while disposed to
give labor unions entire and fair recognition
as between employer and employe, would not
have any dealing with the representatives of
those unions. They would hot recognize" the
right of the representatives of a union either
to . treat with Â¦ it or to meet it for the purpose
of conference. They would submit to no in
terference of any kind whatsoever by a union
in its relations to its employes.
The committee of the' Employers' Association
also stated, however, that its attorney and sec
retary, M. F. Michael, was at all times will
ing to meet the representatives of these unions,
but not as the representative of the Employ
ers' Association, but simply in his capacity of
legal adviser and counsel of that association;
that the Employers' Association would not
Itself or by representative meet the representa
tives of a union.' '' , â¢ ...,.,
Your committee. In reply, stated that what
the labor unions then desired, - so far as your
committee had been able to determine from
its meetings with their leaders, was a confer
ence between their representatives and the
representatives of the Employers' Association
and that in the Judgment of ' your committee
that conference should be granted. They urged
that the great issue Involved in | the contro-'
versy | imperatively exacted a direct meeting
between the immediate j representatives of | the
Employers' Association and the representa
tives of the labor unions; that . economic issues*
of such vast consequence to a great ' proportion
of this community could not be fairly and ade
quately passed upon and disposed of excepting
by such a conference. . .
â¢ Your committee assured the members . of the
association present that It did not appear be
fore them .as the advocate of the cause of
either side, but that in all justice and fair
ness it was the right of the labor unions to
meet the Employers' Association, and that In
the opinion of the committee it would be fruit
ful of results that would effect a settlement
of the labor troubles. .
The conference lasted* about two hours, and
your committee was told that Its suggestions
would be taken under advisement and deliber
ated upon, % and that it Â¦ would be advised of
(he conclusion, of .the Employers' Association
; Your committee then retired.
In order that v nothing should be left undone
to bring about- the conference for which ydur
conrnittee had so strongly pleaded, your com
mittee met . again on September 2 and caused
a communication to be . sent to the board of
directors of the Employers' Association read-
Ing as follows:: Â¦.-. â¢ - .
Direct Conference Urged.
'â¢<- "SAN FRANCISCO, September 2," 1901.
"To the Directors of the Employers' Associa
tion,'San Francisco, Cal.â Gentlemen: Though
at the conference that we held with your com
mittee on Saturday last we I presented In . full
the reasons why, we deemed it the part of wis
dom Â¦ for â¢ your association, or some . representa
tive thereof other than your "attorney, to meet
the representatives of the labor unions, yet, as
your arguments . all ; led us to believe- that the
thing that we demanded â¢ would * be denied in
the end, -rather than omit any step that might
lead to a solution of the present labor difficul
ties, we beg. again to submit to you succinctly
our reasons for .urging you to grant this con
ference.- -'-'* â¢; -âÂ¦..Â¦.,-Â¦Â¦Â¦-/Â¦:...-:.; i ;: '_. ; -. . Â¦ .
!.*We believe that this conference would allay
the discontent Â¦ of the labor Â¦ organizations In a
great measure, which has i been excited to a
fever heat by your attitude,' which denies them
the right of petition or of audience. Youttll
them: - 'We will, recognize your' labor unions
and â¢ do nothing antagonistic : to . them, â¢ but we
will not meet nor. will we treat with them.'
. '.'This, as was . stated at your, meeting, is in- :
dulging the labor unions in an abstraction.- -We
do not say. that you shall , treat Â¦ with them* or
that you. shall make any. terms at all with them
that are; not entirely agreeable to yourselves
We Â¦ do , not ask . that you ; make l any contracts
, with those ' organizations. , or in any Â¦ way bind
FRED HUFFERNAN, 'a non-union
engineer, was fatally injured last
evening by three strikers, who
beat him with an Iron-bar. . /
Huffernan, who is employed by
Healy, Tibbitts & Co., was about to en
ter his .home at Green and Larkin streets
when he was suddenly attacked. He had
a revolver Â¦with him, but he was unable
to use it, as he was knocked senseless by
the . first" blow. After repeatedly kicking
their helpless victim â¢ the strikers threw
away the bar and ran down the street.
Huflernan was picked' up by two citizens
who witnessed the assault and carried
into his house. An examination 'disclosed
that he was suffering from a fracture of
the skull, besides a broken nose and Â¦ a
number of contusions about the face end
neck. The doctor who attended him gives
as his opinion that he is fatally injured.
Hulternan has been employed by Hcaly,
Tibbitts. &. Co. since tne Inauguration of
the strike. Shortly alter 5 o'clock last
evening. he started for his home, accom
panied by Serg-eant Christiansen. Tne
latter, thinking ttuffeman would not be
molested, left nim at Jackson and LArkin
streets to take- several other non-union
men to their homes. Huffernan's assail
ants were concealed. In a -yard, and as
tneir victim approached he was suddenly
assailed and oeaten into insensibility. A
young man who was passing at the time,
seeing a 1 revolver sticking out of Hufter
nan's pocket, promptly seized it, intend
ing to nre at his assailants, who were
running along the street.- By the time
the young man, who was unaccustomed
to the use of firearms, managed to raise
the trigger the trio of thugs had disap
peared, iv" ; Â¦ - .......
As soon- as the brutal assault was re
ported to Captain Wittman he detailed
Police. Officer Cayot to find the assailants
of the. engineer. Accompanied by Special
Officer William Cooke, Cayot went to the
water front, where he arrested two strik
ers, who, it Is claimed, threatened to put
Huffernan .out of the way. They were
confronted by a witness to the assault,
and as he was positive that they were not
the men they were given their freedom.

At the Central Theater they are cutting,
polishing, reshaping and generally mak
ing over to its entire advantage Edward
Eisner's play. "A Voice From the Wil
derness." Its own father will not know it
when they are through with it up there,
and what Is of considerably more Impor
tance we shall hardly recognize it our
selves. With the wealth of picturesque
material at hand Eisner certainly could
hardly escape finding useful situation for
his drama, and has also been happy
enough to hit upon a dramatic central in
cident, but further than that he has not
gone. His play is no play. There Is no
dramatic sequence, no connected story,
simply a series of splendid, thrilling pict
ures and Incidents. His English is flat,
vulgar and hopelessly commonplace, and
the marvel is that It passed the censor at
the Central at all. But "A Voice From
the Wilderness" has again amply demon
strated among other things the gorgeous
ly picturesque quality of biblical history,
and Its adaptability to dramatic treat
ment. It has further demonstrated that
we have in Messrs. Belasco and Thall
managers with the courage of their con
victions, and a grit and enterprise that
will carry them on to big things for them
selves and us some near day. Again we
have found that the local artist In scenes
has all the necessary genius for mounting
a big production, and that we can dress s
play Just as well as the next town, even
if that happens to be New Tork.
There is a larga diversity or opmion
about Mr. Downing^ John tho Baptist,
and certainly appearances are against
him. Even to the most imaginative her
can hardly suggest John's diet of locusts*
and wild honey, but I still claim for him a
certain dignityâ intermittent, and con
siderable sympathy for the part. Bnt tha
gladiator habit still sticks, and he 1st
occasionally brutal where hÂ© should bÂ«
merely firm, noisy where ho should bs
gentle, harsh where he shonld bÂ« mild,
until one can get up quite. a> respectable
sympathy for the rather badly berated
Herodlas.
In Miss Marshall, who plays Herodlas.
there is another discovery. She. Is a new"
comer her*, but has already made a
mark. She has a striking presencÂ© and
personality, temperament and truth of
Inspiration. Her Herodlas Is an almost
completely convincing performance, lack-
Ing only in shading and subtlety.
Mr. Downing's daughter, who is cast aa
.Huldahâ a too small partâ Is another
pleasurable surprise. Miss Downing mada
her first appearance this week and mada
a gratifying success. She has an elocu
tionary finish most grateful to thÂ© ear Is
dramatically talented and Is & graceful
pretty girl besides. Oza Waldrop Isa
charming Salome and enould have been
brought in earlier In the play. The Dlav
is crowding the house In a most encourag
ing fashion and there Is every prospect
that the management will not lose by its
ing better than this. Miss Sanford. a for
mer Oakland girl, and Mabel Morrison
also add to the felicitously high-bred at
mosphere that reigns, and the settings
and costumes are alone worth the price.
It is announced that a. Nevv- York- publishing house intends to issue 100,000 copies as the
first edition of a ; new -hovel; so it looks now as if we/Have reached the enTof big things even hi
.' It is.stated that the King of Belgium is desirous of resigning his throne so that he can go
to Paris and lead -a quiet life, but there are 1 people who believe he would not live so very quiet
If Kitchener had anything like Cleveland's command of language he would have a splen
did opportunity now to denounce the Boers for pernicious activity and warn them to get them
selves into innocuous desuetude. : ' s ''"
On the 17th of. this month New York is to hold a primary ' election . under a new primary
law, and the papers have begun to urge goocTcitizens to pay attention to it, but the chances are
the result will be much the same as it was in San Francisco.
IT is time to put an end to lawlessness in -this. city. IVIen must not any longer be held prison
ers in union headquarters, and then taken out and be beaten and robbed. If the executive
authority of San Francisco will not or cannot protect men engaged in lawful pursuits, a
power will be found that will protect them. Patience is exhausted. The law must be vihdi-
LAWLESSNESS MUST CEASE.
. We have another duty, and that is to starve back into the gutter/whence it crawled, the
journalism which is the advance guard of such crimes. The citizens of Hanford in this State took
the right view when they smote such' journalism by burning Hearst in effigy.
In his cooler moments Senator Platt will acknowledge his mistake and recall his unfor
tunate speech. // v :Â¦ , ; Â¦ - : .-: :
If the President die, let the law take its course and this assassin go to' the electric chair
and die as the lightning sears his black heart, just as if his victim had been a laborer on the Ex
position grounds instead of the President of the republic. Then let the experience apply to the
safguarding of our national honor and life/ Let us declare that this country' must cease to be an
asylum for these anarchist murderers who spell their names with consonants. Here is liberty,
but not liberty to incite murder and do bloody deeds. Let the nests of anarchists in our large
cities be- cleaned out' Let these cold-blooded serpents be hunted from the country and refused
shelter of laws ' they come here to destroy. *The legal hanging of a good lot of them in Chicago
had a deterrent effect that was unfortunately changed when an anarchist Governor, Altgeld, par
doned those of the gang whom a mistaken mercy had favored with life imprisonment. But let
us have no lynching. Let us show the world that American law carries a remedy for every

IN his comments on the work of the assassin against the President, Senator Platt committed
a great mistake in saying it was, a case in which lyjiching- is justifiable.
Americans are shamed and humiliated by the occurrence. It is the lifting of the hand
of murder against government and law. Men bow their heads in sorrow that, the republic
can be the scene of such a crime. The person of the President is the symbol of lawful, consti
tutional government. The bullet aimed at him is aimed at law and liberty. Let these vindicate
themselves in line with their high purpose. Lynching is a blow aimed at the law. To lynch this
miscreant would add to the shame that is upon the country. Let us learn from the high restraint
shown by the Government of the kingdom of Italy. There death is not the penalty for murder.
It would have been easy in the uproar of passion that followed the murder of King Humbert ' to
have wrenched the law so as to have executed his assassin. But this was not done. The defiant
wretch was sent to the galleys exactly as if his victim had been a peasant and not .a king. So let
it be here. .

There Is a pleasant welcome to Dr. H.
J. Stewart to his new position as organist
of the Trinity Church. Boston, in the Bos
ton Evening Transcript of August 29. The
Transcript devotes a half-column to Dr.
Stewart's history. The California organ
ise (for so he may be regarded, having
seen fifteen years' service as organist in
California) succeeded Professor Horatio
W. Parker in Boston, who goes after eight
years at Trinity Church, to devote himself
entirely to his work, at Yale University.
It was at the instance of â¢ the rector of
the church. Rev. E. Winchester Donald,
D. D., who heard Dr. Stewart play at the
Pan-American Exposition, that the.organ
ist was invited to assume the post of mu
sical director of Trinity's forces, and that
California lost another gopd musician. I
see that the Boston churches "go in" for
summer vacations and Dr. Stewart will
not therefore enter upon his new duties
for some weeks to come.

vising: the public of Miss Marie Withrow' s
return to San Frandscip, as the gifted
tether is busily occupied in completing
a trcnual of singing. But Miss Withrow
has already had a few quiet weeks with
her book, which she expects to finish
v'ithin the three months' limit of her stay,
and meantime there are not a few musical
folk still in Ignorance of her return. It Is
four years since Miss Withrow left San
Francisco for London. Since then she has
been doing all kinds of good work in the
English capital, teaching, lecturing and
penning things about her art Among her
pupils is Mrs. Randegger, wife of the
famous vocal teacher; Marie Tempest,
â¢who gratefully accords her Instructor the
credit of having restored a voice that was
all but completely ruined; W. Talleur An
drews, the clever Californlan, who is earn
ing nattering reputation for himself in
London, and many others that have been
worthily heard from. It is even amusing
to think of a teacher from far California
acquiring such place in the English me
tropolis as Miss Withrow has now, but

The modest and enthusiastic little band
of clever young women who .have ap
peared for some seasons under the title
of the Saturday Morning Orchestra will
shortly take up their work again. Mr.
Weil, their able leader of last year, has
called the girls to order, and a first meet-
Ing was held yesterday at Sherman &
Clay Hall. By some accidentâ it has been
laid on the catâ last year's list of the
young ladies' addresses has been lost, and
some therefore have unavoidably been
left without invitation to the new course.
If they will kindly consider this as a pre
liminary notification and apply for later
news to Oscar Weil, at Sherman & Clay's
music store or at 1514 Sacramento street,
their conductor will esteem It a favor. The
first rehearsal will probably be held next
Saturday morning, and I should advise
any girl with a reasonably good technique
and a reverent desire to know something
of the great domain of orchestral music
to become a member of the modest little

for dramatic sopranos in spite of its ardu

and her phrasing is always delightfully
artistic, but the upper notes are rather
out of her range and become sometimes
thin, sometimes harsh, and her tone in
the mezzo voces has a wavering quality,
that approaches the Insidious tremolo.

In no sense does newspaper rivalry enter into the spirit in which we find it necessary to
state these facts. Nor is partisan opposition a part of it. The political party which has such an
advocate is to be pitied and commiserated. It is the victim of a misfortune the most serious
that can befall an organization. When President Cleveland was asked to appoint to office a
newspaper man who by defaming Blaine had attacked the character of Mrs. Blaine, he said: "I
will hot appoint that man. He deserves only my. contempt. He attacked the character of Mrs.
Blaine, a lady and a mother. The party was' not responsible, Wand would be disgraced by his
recognition." .;..-"'"
That uttered the proper and manly spirit of wholesome partisanship. - .
In this community the blackguard, murder promoting, riot exciting policy of the Exam
iner will not be condoned, . though it snivel never so tearfully.
Mr. Hearst has industriously used his three pernicious papers to represent the President
as the opposite of its fervid characterizations of r Saturday morning. Mr. Hearst has played upon
the passions of the ignorant, has represented the President as standing between the people and
their happiness and^welfare, the arch enemy of liberty and prosperity, and has invited the cowardly
assassin to the bloody work that was the logical and necessary outcome of such teaching.
The connection was made apparent between its characterization of the President and the
potent passions incited by the labor strikes here and in the East. The Examiner, by all the chem
istry of hatred and falsehood, created an atmosphere of lawlessness and murder. It pointed the
finger of rancor at the victim, and when an imported assassin, breathing that atmosphere, exe
cuted the purpose which has been in all that Hearst has hired to be written and pictured, he pro
fesses to deplore what he encouraged and weeps crocodile tears over the victim. The sequence
and connection of events prove Hearst to be a coward, and his papers to be the enemies of Amer
ican institutions, of law and order. It is not pleasant to have to say these things, but they are
commanded by loyalty to the truth. This man is not admonished by events. He is. ready to do
the same thing over again. The shameless Examiner and its two Eastern promoters of assassin
ation cannot change. Their habit of pandering to the lowest passions of man is fixed in those
papers. It is their hideous and disfiguring birthmark worn where all men must see it.
That vicious sheet may take either horn of its dilemma. It, is either a craven and lying
coward, or a feculent slanderer, with the instincts only of the ape, which has no reason for its
rage. ..
The reader will ask why, if the Examiner uttered its real sentiments on Saturday morn
ing, has it for months maliciously maligned' the President? â¢ Its cartoons, over which was the
line, ostentatiously displayed, "Copyrighted by W.R. Hearst," have sought to identify President
McKinley with every sinister and sordid scheme which could be thought of to oppress and dis
tress his fellow-citizens. The Examiner a pathetic ' figure \o represent the "common
people," and then beset that effigy with every kind of affront, wrong and oppression, and accom- "
panied it with a caricature . of the President rapturously applauding the sad plight of the victim.
Its Saturday editorial was the result . of a fear of popular vengeance, for maligners are always
base cowardsâ or it was a sincere expression. If the- latter, it was a confession that for months it
had vulgarly lied about and maliciously incited the murder of the man, "loved by. the people, de
voted to their interests, who honestly sought to obey the popular, will."
We predicted that the Examiner would attempt by. sniveling hypocrisy to condone its in
citement to the President's' murder, which it has continued ever since his last election. True to its
instincts that noisome sheet vindicated our "prediction. On Saturday in a cringing editorial it
said: "William McKinley is loved as an American citizen, an American soldier, a simple man
earnestly devoted to the interests of the nation. Honest effort to obey the will -of the^peoplc, a
life devoted to that noblest of humniv pursuits, the duties of government, is rewarded by the
bullet of the assassin," and so on through black letter and light runs this hypocritical expression.
y^-^C N Friday morning the Examiner, reproduced from its. Eastern twins, the Journal of
Â¦'Â¦/ I New York and American of Chicago, a coarse and vulgar cartoon, representing Presi-
V J dent McKinley as a negro minstrel with blacked face, singing a coon song in which he
"*r was made to avow bitter enmity to the common people. .Within seven hours after
that libelous attack appeared, a viper, professing that his fangs were poisoned to strike for that
same common people, had struck the President down.

headquarters from 8 o'clock Friday morn

had gone to Berry street to see a friend

them' made a slash at him with'-a knife,
cutting the sleeve of his coat. They drag

quarters, where he was denounced as a
"scab." He protested and said he was a
dishwasher and told where he worked and
that he was a union man. They did not
believe him and .kept him there till 7
o'clock at night, when he was released.
As he had to go to work at 6 o'clock that
night he had lost his job. He was ad
vised to apply for a warrant for the ar
rest of the two men on a charge of false
imprisonment. He did so, but It was not
issued, as he had no witnesses to corrob

On the other hand, should Schley be
exonerated from the allegations made
against him, the vindication can give him
no higher place in popular esteem than
he holds and has held since that smoke
blown morning off Santiago which gave
"glory enough for all!"
Actually, there can be no substantial
result, nothing that one can lay one's
finger upon and specify as a concrete
finale. Rear Admiral Schley might be
found guilty of every one of the allega
tions embodied in the ten precepts, and
for all practical purposes remain just
where he stands to-day. For the law
specifically states that every person In the
navy who is amenable to court-martial
must be brought to trial, before the lapse
of two years, or not brought to trial at
all. It now is, aa every one knows, more
than two years since the charges of "rep
rehensible conduct" were filed against
him.
The whole navy is preparing for trial
now, one more momentous, it would seem,
than was that other contest at Santiago,
for in this the honor of the service is in
volved, and so Intricately involved that
whatever may be the outcome, black
stains will be left.
This controversy, the deplorable Samp-
Bon-Schley imbroglio, had its origin In
the war with Spain, and In it are involved
numerous officers whose names the war
made household words.

FINDS BOMBS
WITH HIS PICK
Startling Discovery Is
Made by a Workman
in Chicago.
CHJCAGO, Sept- 7.â Burled close to
the Haymarket monument stood,
facing Randolph street, a city laborer to
day found two large dynamite bombs.
\Vord of the discovery spread rapidly and
e. crowd soon gathered around the exca-
Vatlon and gazed curiously at the explo
sives. They were taken to Inspector
Fhea'e office in the Desplaines-street sta
tion. The inspector ordered them de
etroyed.
Street laborers began work early in the
fiay tearing up the pavement around the
epot where the monument to the victims
of the Haymorket riot stood.
They had dug down about a foot when
one of the men who was using a pick
turned up what appeared to be two old
sections of iron pipe. He was about to
throw them aside when he noticed thai
the ends were plugged. He examined them
again and then set them carefully on the
ground and stepped back.
Two city detectives noticing the crowd
that gathered quickly forced their \ray
through the throng and took the bombs to
the Desplaines-street station.
A superficial examination convinced In
spector Shea that they were loaded with
dynamite. The police axe at a loss to
explain how the bombs were burled in
the street.
Progress en Manchurian Kail-way.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 7.â Dispatches
f-om Vladivostok report the progress on
the Manchurian Railway. All the rails
are down on the Port Arthur branch and
immense quajitities of material have been
forwarded up the river for the Â¦western
branch. Connection with the Siberian
Railway vdll, it is expected, be made this
autumn.
In the great city of London, the Lancet
says, there must be about five hundred
tnoiif;a!iu people who cannot afford to pay
a Mifliciently high rent to secure healthy

"There is no question, concerning the
availability of labor when we get to grow
ing our tea on a large scale. There Is any
number of young people who will seek
employment as pickers of the tea leaves,
as wagies will be good. We are now Im
porting plants from China, Ceylon and
Japan, and we propose raising the high
est grade -of the product in this country."
âChicago Journal.
The Secretary of Agriculture, speaking
of the raising of tea In this country, re
cently said: "We are now succeeding ad
mirably An the. production of tea In the
United States. It Is only a question of a
short time when we will be able to raise
all the tea demanded for use in this coun
try. The two tons of tea grown at Sum
merville, S. C.last year so wall satisfied
the New York investors interested in the
industry that they immediately formed a
syndicate and bought 6000 acres of land in
the State, upon which Tea will be grown.
"This department last year sent tea
plants to every gulf State in the Union,
from the Carolinas to California, for ex
perimental raising. We have just heard
from South Carolina that imported ma
chinery in use there is able to make green
tea from the black product in one hour.
We do not yet manufacture such machin
ery In this country, but we will get to
that later. Â¦ .Â»

I It is explained at the legation that it is
I feared the Ecuadorean expedition, aided
I by Nlcaraguans; will attack Panama
while Venezuela assails Colon.
' ' The legation also received a dispatch
! from the Secretary of State at Bogota
I saying that Colombia accepts the friendly
! mediation of the United States.
U WILLiBMSTADT, Island of Curacao,
I Sept. 7.â The cable between Curacao and
! Maracaibo is broken. This is the cause
i of the absence of news from the Venezue
j Ian frontier, which can only be obtained
| by letter. Under date of September 4
I mail advices say that the Venezuelan
troops have not made another attempt to
1 invade Colombia. President Castro abso
lutely refuses to entertain the idea of ac
cepting the good offices of the United
States.- Â¦
CARACAS, Sept. 7.â It is understood
that the United States legation will make
1 no further attempt to effect a settlement
1 of the Venezuelan trouble.
"WILLEMSTAD, Curacao, Sept. 7.â
"Venezuelan fleet is bombarding Rio
Hacha.. - . BECERRA."
Dr. Becerra was formerly Colombian
Minister in Washington.
The Colombian legation to-night re
ceived the following telegram from the
acting Governor of Panama:
"We are expecting simultaneous at
tacks on Panama and Colon."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â The Colom
bian legation has received the following
cablegram: Â«.
A report of the proposed visit which
reached New York this afternoon is said
to have been carried at once -directly to
Mr. Morgan by Mr. Schwab, and the de
tails were approved by him. It was an
nounced to-night that the corporation had
made no change In Its original proposi
tion for a settlement, and the only gain
that the Amalgamated men could make
by. coming. to New York would be the per
sonal explanation of all the points of the
agreement and the signing of the agree
ment with the officials of the corporation.
It Is learned late to-night that Presi
dent T. J. Shaffer aÂ«d the members of
the executive board of the Amalgamated
Association will start for New York Sun
day night unless there is another change
of plans in the meantime. The represen
tatives- of the organization go to the me
tropolis for the purpose of conferring per
sonally with President Schwab of the
United States Steel Corporation.
Continuing, he said: "President McKin
ley Is a great and a good man. I could
scarcely believe that an attempt had been
made on his life when I first heard the
news. It seems almost Impossible that
such a man as he is could have an enemy
among any set of men."
President Shaffer's remarks were echoed
and re-echoed among the mill men about
Amalgamated headquarters during the
day. .
"The foul deed of that man is too hor
rible to be permitted to enter into any
discussion of this kind. We need no such
incentive to settle our difficulties."
In the offices of the Carnegie building it
was said there was no change in the
strike situation. The officials of the com
panies interested were making every ef
fort possible fo start the plants. Presi
dent Shaffer said in connection with the
talk of a settlement of the strike that
there was a general impression going
abroad that-the Amalgamated Association
was beaten in this contest. This was far
from true. He said that he did not re
gard the outlook as any more changed
than before the meeting. He deplored the
story that had gone out that the attempt
ed assassination of President Â¦ McKinley
would have the effect of hastening settle
ment of the trouble.
All the executive board of the Amalga
mated Association remained in session to
day. Shortly before 6 o'clock this even
ing President SJhaffer came out of the
meeting and announced with' much posi
tiveness that nothing^would be given out.
From the earnestness of the discussion of
the board it was apparent, however, that
some unusual' effort wes being made to
reach a. conclusion ' of the disastrous
struggle and it is again confidently re
ported that Shaffer and his board will be
in New York Monday morning.
The 'only thing that was stated in the
proposition was that the longer the strik
ers l?eld off from the' peace negotiations
the more idle mills would be started and
the less union mills would be found on
the list when final steps were taken to
end the struggle.. Every union mill that
the trust has thus far started since the
strike began is to. remain non-union, while
thooe still idle when , the agreement is
reached will be allowed to remain union
and under Amalgamated influence.
PITTSBURG, Sept. 7.â A settlement of
the steel workers' strike against the
United States Steel â¢ Corporation ' was
looked for to-day. It did not materialize,
but that it is near at hand is generally
conceded. The report that President
Schwab had put a time limit on his prop
osition to the Amalgamated men was de
nied in "official circles to-day.

:â¢â¢ The drawing for 'the consolation singles
tournament, to be played Monday morn-
Ing, resulted as follows: ' .
â¢ In the morning Alfonso Bell, the cham
pion of Southern California, by beating
Bob Whitney in the finals of the singles
tournament won that event and earned
the right to play George Whitney on
Monday for the championship of the
coast. The . score In "Bell's favor was 6-1,
6-8, 6-1, 6-3.
â¢ While the majority picked Whitney lo
win, still those who know him best were
very much afraid he would lose to Bell.
When up against a stranger Whitney
loses self-control and becomes very nerv
ous.âAt times he drove beautifully, but
his nets and outs were very . numerous.
Bell played a fine game at the net. but
was rather, weak in the back court. His
service worried "Whitney considerably, the
bounce being too high. to driye. Â¦
"The championship match in singles will
be played Monday 'afternoon, at Â¦ 2:30
o'clock, when Â¦ Champion George Whitney
will be, called upon to defend his title
against Bell, the winner of the tourna
ment. ;
Smith Â¦ and. McGavin came very near
winning. both the second and third sets.
In the second they had a lead of 6-5 and
in the third they led at 3-0 and 4-2 van
tage in v their favor. Robert' was rather
tired from his match In the morning and
Gecrge was a trifle nervous. The losers
both played their hardest, and although
beaten were not disgraced. Their show
ing of ' yesterday" was better than . that
made by the Hardys a year ago against
the same team. There was an unusually
large crov.-d of spectators present and ex
citement ran high at critical moments.
The Whitney brothers â George and Rob
ert â by beating . Smith and McGavin yes
terday in the challenge match on the San
Rafael courts are the champions of the
coast in doubles for the coming year.
They were expected to win with little
trouble, but their opponents put up a
game fight. The score in favor of the
Whltneys was 6-3. 8-6, 7-5.
NETV YORK, Sept. 7.â Two fixtures
were decided at the Sheepshead Bay races
to-daj'. One was the Great Filly stakes,
worth $28,750, the other the Century stakes
of $10,000, at one mile and a half. , Blue
Girl, William C. Whitney's filly, was
beaten a short head for the first named
in a sensational finish with Leonora. Lor
ing. Blue Girl was coupled with Gunfire
and Rose of May as the Whitney entry
and was a 3 to 5 favorite. Leonora Lor
ing jumped to the front at tho start, and,
with Hatasco and Lux Casta in close.at
tendance, made the running tp~ the" bend
for home. Far back Blue Girl was strug
gling along with the trailers. -At the last
furlong pole Blue Girl was eight lengths
behind. Shaw at this point got to work
on the , favorite and with a phenomenal
burst of speed Blue Girl flew past the
others and on to the post just a head-be
hind the winner, Leonora Lorinp lasting
long enough to win by a head. Mr."Whit
ney after the race asked the stewards to
make an official investigation of Shaw's
ride on Blue Girl. .

was born to them, James Stevens, who is
now S years of age. In October. 1899, she
secured a divorce for willful neglect. She
had property on Bush street in her own
right worth several thousand dollars.
Pending the divorce Stevens pretended
that he was anxious for the boy's wel
fare, and wanted money deposited in
bank to be held in trust for him till he at
tained his majority. She agreed to de
posit flOOO In the Hibernia Bank after the
divorce was granted and she had sold her
property. She. Stevens and the boy went
to the. bank and she wanted the money
deposited in their three names, but the
bank would only accept two names, and
Stevens insisted upon his and the boy's
name being selected, to which she con
sented. He promised to pay $15 per month
for the boy's support, but she has only
received $20 through Stevens' mother.
On October 6 of last year Stevens drew
the interest on the deposit. November 1 he
drew 543 and December 5 the balance of

Everett St. John, the former president
cf the Seaboard line. Is still a guest at
the Palace. He is still very reticent as
to the objects : of his visit here. Many
of the old railroad officials state that they
think St. John has come to take Fitz
hugh's position.
On the other hand the guests of the
Hotel Rafael tell quite a different story.
They claim that Fltzhugh came over to
the hotel on- Friday nigrht and 'that with
in two .hours all his belongings had been
packed; that Mrs. Fltzhugh , went around
the hotel bidding everybody good-by and
eaylng that she was going East and might
never see them asrain.
Fltzhugb's secretary was seen last even-
Ing. He became very confidential and
paid that the president's assistant had
pone East on a pleasure Jaunt. He said
that he expected that Fitzhugh would be
gone some time, but that he would surely
return. '
Under the regime of President Hays
the â¢policy of the company and the move
ments of his most prominent officials have
been hard to ascertain. The departure of
Fltzhugh was not generally known in
railroad circles until late yesterday.
When It became general gossip no motive
for his departure could be given.-
H. E. Fltzhugh, who has -acted as as
sistant to President Hays of the Southern
Pacific Company -for a brief period,
packed up bag and baggage Friday and
went East. He took his wife and family
with him and now all the railroad men
around the yellow building are guessing
whether he Intends to "return or whether
he has resigned his position. .Â¦

TV* should have feared for Miss "Wagner's
sanity had it not been that medical treatment
brought her out of her convulsive epells. Bhe
has been rational for several days and has at

to her would know that she vaa ill. She is
kept very quiet and is allowed to see only a
few of her most Intimate friends. Her father
and mother are with her constantly and are
greatly encouraged over her improvement.
W. Schmidt, Miss Wagner's brother-in
law, and at whose home the young lady
Is now staying, said to-day:
Miss Wagner's condition is due to shock from
frlgrht and strain frpm holding- thÂ« runaway
horse. The fever eettllng in her brain has
given her a form of dementia at times, but
aa 6oon aa the fever ia cured her recovery
may be hoped for. Care and quiet is what
she needs. She should rest in seclusion for
eome time.
Miss Wagner's condition has been,pecu
liar. In her weakened state fear of the
panther would come over her again and
then the fever would settle in her brain,
bringing on violent spells of half an hour's
duration. By applying ice to her hoad
and hot applications to her feet the blood
would be. drawn from her brain and her
normal condition restored. This and
other treatments have succeeded in les
sening the number and violence of her
convulsive spells and in reducing her
fever. Every hope Is now entertained for
her complete recovery.
of Miss Wagner's . condition,
Dr. Miner said:
Miss Pearl "Wagner of Berkeley, who
was prostrated from fright by having a
panther pursue her in the Trinity County
mountains six weeks ago, is recovering
from the terrible experience she under
went. For nearly a week she has attend
ed her meals regularly and has had none
of the violent convulsions and spells of
unconsciousness to which she was sub
ject for a number of days after her fright.
ShÂ« still has a fever into which the shock
threw her, but this is being gradually
overcome. Dr. H. N. Miner, the attend
ing physician, believes that with the con
quering of the fever complete health will
be restored.

Charles O. Cole Arrested
on Charges of Grand
Larceny.
T
Accused of Robbing the In
dianapolis Furniture
Company.
Change of Constitution Re-
garding Residence of
Trustees.
Charles C. Cole, a porter in the employ
ment of the Indianapolis Furniture Com
pany, 750 Mission street, was arrested in
the store yesterday afternoon by Detec
tive Ryan and booked at the City Prison
on three charges of grand larceny, iiv'-
About five weeks ago the fact was pub
lished in The Call that about $2500 worth
of carpets, portieres, lace curtains and
blankets had been stolen from the store of
the furniture company and a search war
rent had been procured to recover tha
goods. It was suspected at that time
that Cole was the thief and since then De
tective Ryaiv has been working on the
case and claims that he has absolute
proof of Cole's guilt.
Cole the detective says, had been em
ployed for two years. AUout a year ago
rolls of carpets were missing and in tlma
more rolls went astray, besides quanti
ties of other goods. It was discovered by
Ryan that Cole, whp had a key to the
store, was, in the habit of going there
early in the. morning before any one else
arrived and taking the stolen goods to
the rear entrance on Jessie street, where
they were carted away by a confederate,
who has not yet been arrested. Ryan al
leges that Robert Hegerty. who was one
of the proprietors of the Pabst cafe, and
is now in Nome, was the "fence."
Hegerty offered R. J. Graf, son-in-law
of Jake Rauer, ten rolls of carpet valued
at $500 for $250.. The rolls were sent to
Graf's house, but when Kauer saw* them
he told Graf to have nothing to do with
them and they were returned to Heg
erty, who subsequently sold them to T.
D. McCarty, furniture dealer. 764 Mission
Btreet, and there is a civil suit now pend
ing for their recovery /rom McCarty.
Ryan says he has located some of the
other rolls of carpet and expects to be
able to recover them and the other goods.i
Hegerty would have been arrested if he
had not gone to Nome. The Indianapolis
Company says it will lay the whole mat
ter before the Grand Jury. Cole Is a
married man and lives at 320 Turk strtet.
SEVEN FELONY CHABGES
MADE AGAINST COLLECTOR
The members of the Mechanics* Insti
tute held a quarterly meeting last night,
at which an important article of the con
stitution was amended and Mayor Phelan
submitted two propositions relative to the
Carnegie library- gift. One proposition
was received with a smile and dismissed
without a thought. The members will
think about the other..
The Mayor's first proposition was that
the Pavilion site be turned over to tha
city aa a gift. There might bÂ© conditions
attached to the gift er the trust as it was
referred to and the dictation of these con
ditions was to be the compensation of tha
Mechanics' Institute for its $700,000 block
of land. .The Mayor was told to "try,
again."
His Honor explained that the Pavilion
site was worth probably $700,000 and that
the city could not afford to pay that much.
Both the Supervisors, he said, and tha
City Library Trustees had made up their
minds that the present site of the Me
chanics' Pavilion was the proper place
for the Carnegie library and they wanted
it They would pay a reasonable figure
if they could not get it as a gift. He pro
posed $600,000 aa about the proper amount
With this sum, he said, the institute
trustees could put up a new building on
their Post-street site. This is the offer
the members will consider. A decision wlil
be given at an early date, as, under the
charter, all purchases of land by the city
exceeding $50,000 have to receive- the sanc
tion of popular vote. An early decision,
will be necessary if the people's sanction
is to be asked at the next election. (.
The constitution was so amended that
trusteeship is no longer limited to mem
bers residing in the city. No member,
however, of less than one year's standing
will be eligible. .
The election of George D. Clark as trus
tee in place of W. A. Beatty. resigned,
was confirmed. :
The California Association of Stationary
Engineers No. 3 has affiliated with tho In
stitute and a proposition for similar as-,
sociation -with the Technical Society 13
under consideration.
With the view of finding out Jttst how
the 3500 members stood on the questions
involving steps to be taken in the future,
a list of questions was sent to each mem
ber. There were received 1621 answers, as
follows:
To sell Mechanics' Pavilion, 1275; to give
It to the city. 223: in favor of selling Fol
som-street lot. '1515; " against selling, BO;
in favor of selling portion of Pavilion. IS;

Francesco Ciampa Sprung a Leak and
Empereur Menelik Nearly Went
Ashore.
The Italian ship Francesco Ciampa nr
rived from Newcastle, England, yesterday
after a run of 186 days, via Gibraltar 143
days, with a cargo of firebrick and pig
Iron. She sailed from England on March
18 and when 300 miles northwest of Gib
raltar a terrific gale was encountered. The
vessel labored heavily and several plate*
on the starboard bow were started. Cap
tain Cacace put Into Gibraltar and re
paired damages, sailing again for San
Francisco April 18. The remainder of
the voyage was uneventful.
Water Front Notes.
The Empereur Menelik left Newcastle,
Australia, on June 29, ror this port with
2727 tons of coal. AH went well until last
Friday at 7 p. m., when Captain Turlie
found himself about two miles from Point
Reyes. There was a dense fog and no
wind. The bark was rapidly drifting
ashore, so the anchor was let go. Soon
afterward a steamer which Captain Turbe
thinks was the Grace Dollar came along
and offered assistance. It was gladly ac
cepted and the Empereur was towed clear
of Point Reyes and given a good ofllng.
The Grace Dollar then proceeded north
and the bark getting a slant of wind
made port yesterday morning.
The bark Roderick Dhu arrived from
Hilo yesterday after a goodfrun of seven
teen days twelve hours. Captain Johnson
says the people on the island are expect
ing- another outbreak of the volcano, j
The barkentine Gardiner Ci.ty had a nar
row escape Friday night. She came in
with a load of lumber, and while coming
to an anchorage off Meiggs wharf the tide
swept her down toward the breakwater
at fishermen's wharf. Luckily she took
a sheer and went Into the basin, where
the anchor held.
Captain Rivers of the ship A. G. Ropes
had a hard time of it coming here. He
left New York with a Japanese crew and
without any mates. About that time the
law went into effect which made it neces
sary for all mates to hold licenses. The
men on the Ropes had no certificates" and
Captain Rivers had to sail without them.
From New York to Yokohama and thence
to San Francisco he. navigated his vessel
alone and was completely worn out when
this port was reached.

SAYS HE WAS ABUSED
BY THE VENEZUELANS
American Announces That He "Will
Department.
Make Complaint to the State
NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â Hippolyte Lam
bert, a naturalized American, who says
he for years has been traveling through
South America organizing socialJstlc
clubs. has returned on the Clyde line
steamship New York. Lambert told a
story of alleged cruel treatment by
Venezuelans and says his case will be
brought to the attention of the State De
partment at Washington.
According to his story, Lambert arrived
at Caracas on May 20 last and registered
at the United States Consulate. On July
li> he obtained employment in a private
family at Caracas as cook. On the day
following he was arrested by a squad of
police. He protested that he was guilty
of no wrong, but was locked up and his
effects were seized. Among them, he says,
were the notes he had made for year.s
concerning socialism and the condition of
workingmen in the different countries he
had visited.
He charges that his captors beat him
and that he was strung up. On another
occasion, he asserts, he was doubled uji
like a Jackknife by his guards, a wooden
stave v.as placed on his knees and his
arms were bound to the projecting ends.
He was kept in this position, with ten
rifles lying across his back, until he
became unconscious. He was afterward
taken sick with fever and on July 22 was
released and placed on board a steamer
for Santo Domingo, from which place he
arrived here to-day.
THE British bark Baroda, which
went ashore nine miles below Cb
quille on August 29. will probably
. be a total loss. She is hard and
Â¦ fast on the j beach and ? sits up
as straight as if she, were in a
drydock. Tugboats cannot get near
her. and' after- standing.' by her for
two days the. Defiance had to come
back to San Francisco without having
accomplished anything.- The underwriters
are now trying, to have her' taken off on
a percentage basis. . Tenders are asked for
cn the "no cure, no pay" plan. If the
wrecker succeeds he is money in pocket;
If he fails the loss is his.
The Baroda is now lying broadside "on
to the ' beach with her bow pointing
toward Coqullle. At low water sightseers
can walk right around her.. There is a
nine-foot tide and at high water she does
not float. When the Defiance first went
to the scene Captain Trewren anchored in
six fathoms of water, but at low, tide
there was a break all around the tug, so
he quickly took his vessel out into deepsr
water and stayed there. Captain Greijf,
Lloyd's representative, who went 'up on
her, was taken ashore in the life saving
boat and had to remain there, as he could
not get back to the tug on account of the
weather. : --. .-.'â¢;.Â¦ . ...;
"The Baroda seems to be resting as,
easily as if she were in the . drydock,'' '
said Captain Trewren yesterday., "Cap
tain Marr and his men are livlng^bn.the'
beach in a tent made out of vthe'sail^.
They, were taking the yards ' off -hetrwhÂ«m
I left and will probably take everything
they can out of her. She has about: 400
tons of ballast aboard and that"wlll'have<
to be taken out before any attempt' can
be made to. move her. Tugs cannot got
near the stranded vessel and the work of
salving her will have to be done from .the
land." Â¦
The Baroda was on her way from Cnl
lao for Portland when she went ashore.
On August 25 she was spoken by the
steamer St. Paul in a dense fog, and Cap
tain Hays gave the master of the bark
his bearings. Four days later the Baroda
went bow on upon the beach. The chances
are that no one will try to take her off on
the terms offered by the underwriters,
and then she will be sold at auction to
the highest bidder.

Everything in the National Guard is
more quiet than It has been for many
months, there not being anything to oc
cupy the attention of the officers and men
but the rifle practice.
The members of the Seventh Regiment
of Infantry belkve in target practice as
one cf the best means of improving the
quality of the soldier, but they also be
lieve that as members of the National
Guard they ought to have their conve
nience consulted as to the time when they
shall be called upon to shoot at figure tar
gets. In the past they have been permit
ted to have shoots on Sundays because
that did not Interfere with their business
engagements, but recently Lieutenant
George C. Thaxter, rifle Inspector, gave
notice to the several companies of the
regiment that he would not inspect any
rifle shooting on Sunday, and now the
men are very much put out. They say
that to compel "the men to do on a. week
day that which can be as well done on
Sunday is imposing a hardship on them,
as it will interfere with their employment
and business, and that if shooting on Sun
day is to be discontinued many of the
men will drop out of the companies. There
are others who think it would be easier
to apply for another rifle inspector, and
that it might be more beneficial to the
guard to please several hundred men than
to submit to the whims of one man.
The officers of the Second Brigade will
meet at brigade headquarters on Wednes
day evening next to perfect arrangements
for the reception to be tendered to Gen
eral James F. Smith upon his return from
the Philippines.
When Captain James retired from the
command of the naval militia he was di
rected to turn over to Captain Nerney,
his successor, whatever funds he had be
longing to the organization. For some
reason best known to himself he did not
do as requested, but turned the same over
to Adjutant General Seamans, who has
notified Captain Nerney that he is ready
to account to him for /what he has re
ceived.
Orders have been issued for the cruise
of the naval mlhtia on the U. S. S. Phila
delphia. Owing to the limited accommo
dations for naval militia officers and war
rant officers on that vessel, during the
cruise the attendance of officers will be
limited. â¢ The first, second and fifth divi
sions and that portion of the engineer
corps located at San Francisco whl em

BERLIN. Sept. 7.â The papers this week
have devoted a great deal of space' to the
Chinese mission, headed by Prince Chun.
It is characteristic of the secrecy pre
served by the Government regarding the
Easle hitch that r.o'oody knows just what
the controversy was about, and the most
divergent views still prevail. The most
influential papers, however, admit that
Germany managed the matter badly by
not having all the tjuestions regarding the
ceremonial detail arranged before the mis
sion left China.
While the gereral opinion is that Prince
Chun stopped at Basle voluntarily, it is
also said with great positiveness that or
ders were sent from Berlin for the mis
eion to wait on the border until all the de
tails of the expiatory act were settled".
Some of the papers assert and others
yeny that the Emperor demanded a modi
fled kowtow, and the former seems to be
the correct version.
The Hanover Courier admits that Ger
many yielded to the Chinese demands.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung finally admit3
that Germany suffered a humiliation.
Nevertheless all the papers agree that the
Potsdam ceremony was fully satisfactory
to Germany's honor.
The population of Berlin shows much
curiosity to tee Prince Chun. Great
crowds form In the streets where he is
expected to pass. It is said that Prince
Chun will remain in Germany for a fort
night and that he will be present at the
maneuvers next week.
The letter of Emperor Kwang Su to
Emperor William is described as a work
of art in the highest Chinese style, and
also as being of extraordinary beauty.
It is en a strip of the finest sllÂ«c four
meters long, folded up in an envolope
richly ornamented with silk and gold em
broidery.
The quarrel between the agrarians and
the manufacturers continues., and If be
gins to be seen that it endanpers the pros
pects of the tariff bill. The Kreuz Zeitung
renews its argument for a trade agree
ment Â¦with the f nited States as a means
of avoiding- a tariff war with Germany's
European neighbors.
The Sultan of Turkey has ordered that
the service regulations of the German
army be translated for the use of the
Turkish army.

REV. PAUL WELLER.
In answer to a personal letter from an
intimate friend, asking If It were true that
he (Rev. Weller) had become a firm be-
liever in Personal Magnetism and Hypno-
tism, Rev. Weller wrote:
"The facts are: The subject of Person-
al Magnetism or Hypnotism, to which I
have devoted many years of study, was
recently more forcibly than ever called
to my attention through reading a scien-
tific work on the subject, now being circu-
lated by the New York Institute of Sci-
ence of Rochester. N. Y.
"I am a minister of the Gospel, but I
do not hesitate to say that the reading:
of that book and the subsequent study
of Its contents have worked an all-power-
ful, important and good influence over me.
My recommendation of Personal Magnet-
ism, a subject which every man and
woman may study with profit, 13 made
after thorough investigation and with
complete knowledge of its great value. I
make this statement deliberately. Tha
study of Personal Magnetism, as set forth
in the admirable books I have mentioned
above, should be next to the study of the
Holy Bible.
"Personal Magnetism embodies all thÂ«
laws governing- man's influence over man.
It. is the power that makes men mold the
minds of men. It turns llfe'3 failures into
successes. It develops the latent powers
of the will and makes one capable of tha
accomplishment of great deeds. I have
received .many letters on the subject and
to all writers I have answered: 'Writa
to the New York Institute of Science.
Rochester. N. T., asking for their sclen-
tiflp work on Personal Magnetism and
Hypnotism. It will be sent to you free of
charge. If its perusal does as much for
you as it did for me. you will thank me,
the longest day you live for having called
your attention to the book.' Yours truly.
"(Rev.) PAUL WELLER." *
It will only be necessary for you to send;
your request to the New York Institute
of Science. Dept. 11TW. Rochester. N. Y..
and you -will receive the volume Rev. Paul
Weller recommends by return mail. ITV
IS FREE. A postal card will bring it.

No subject has excited so much Interest
or awakened so much discussion amongf
thinking people of late aa that of Per-
sonal Magnetism. It is worthy of nbta
that clergymen, doctors, college presidents
and men of science everywhere are giving
it deep thought. Many of them have open-
ly certified to Its wonderful powers. Tha
outspoken words of the Rev. Paul Weller
of Gorham, N. Y.. in this connection will
call forth no little additional comment.

.Eczema, Tettejx.', Psoriasis, Salt Rheum, Acne and a great many other
diseases of like character arc classed as skin diseases, when they could just as
properly be called blood diseases, for they undoubtedly originate in the blood, like
Cancer, Catarrh, Scrofula, Rheumatism, Contagious Blood Poison, etc. ; the only,
real difference being in the intensity and nature of the poison. The more serious
diseases, Cancer, Catarrh, etc., are caused by some specific poison or virus, which
is either inherited or in other/ways gets into the blood and attacks certain vital
organs or, appears in the form of terrible sores and ulcers, while the milder and
less dangerous skin diseases are caused by blood humors or an over acid condition
of that fluid. These acid poisons, as they ooze out through the pores of the skin,
cause great irritation, with intense itching and burning. The eruption may be of .
a pustular kind, with excessive discharge of thick, gummy fluid, or the skin may
be hot, dry and feverish, swollen and fissured, j Skin diseases, whether they appear

KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD.
Proper Selection of Great Impor-
tance in Summer.
The feeding of Infanta is a very ser-
ious proposition, as all mothers know.
Food must be used that will easily digest,
or the undigested parts will be thrown
into the Intestines and cause sickness.
It is important to know that a food can
be obtained that Is always safe; that is
Grape-Nuts.
A mother writes: "My baby took the
first premium at a baby show on the 8th
inst., and Is in every way a prize baby.
I have fed him on Grape-Nuts since he
was five months old. I also use your Pos-
tum Food Coffee for myself." Mrs. L. F.
Fishback, Alvin, Tex.
Grape-Xuts food is not made solely for
a baby food by any means, but is manu-
factured for all human beings who have
trifling, or serious, difficulties in the
stomach and bowels.
One esi>ecial point of value is that the
food is predigested in the process of man-
ufacture, not by any drugs or chemicals
whatsoever, but simply by the action of
heat, moisture and time, which permits
the diastase to grow, and change the
etarch into grape-sugar. This presents
food to the system ready for immediate
assimilation.
Its eepecial value as a food, beyond the
I fact that it Is easily digested, is that It
.supplies the needed elements to quickly
rebuild the cells in the brain and . nerve
â¢enters throughout the body. . *>-. r

ward as they, have made during the past
few months.-.: ;,.-r; â¢-;Â¦' .-' ../*â-.,.
Kohlberg, Strauss &Frohman have been
the flrÂ«3t concern in San Â¦ Francisco to
adopt it. They leased the entire building
In which their Post-street business was
situated and gave up the larger part of
the second floor to the selling of millinery.
No trimmed hats will be made to order
under any circumstances, consequently
nobody is obligated to purchase. If a hat
does not suit the , buyer Â¦ alterations are
not made and no sale is effected. Conse
quently every one is bound to be pleased.
They have now on exhibition nearly 500
hats, priced between $5 and $15, which
seems, to be thoÂ» popular, amount people
Irl San Francisco are willing to pay fbr
millinery. The, department being, a, new
one, the styles are -naturally up-to-date
and the 'assortment Is. so. large that "to a
casiual observer, it- Is ; almost- bewildering.
Customers giving their ideas of what they
want can. in most instances be shown a
hat exactly along the lines of their ideal.
They, can then try It on and If It does not
suit something; else can be. tried on.". /:â¢
â¢ It is very difficult to tell just what a
hat will look like until it is made and
tried on. The only, remedy for this seem
ed to - be- to Â¦ carry- a large and varied
enough stock of ready made hats to suit
every demand. This necessitated such a
laige amount of capital- and the change
in styles WeÂ» so uncertain that merchants
hesitated at purchasing a sufficient quan
tity of ready made hats to make, the plan
a success. . â¢ Â¦ ..-. ; Â¦ . . ..
From time immemorial women have
found It necessary, to have their hats
made to order, by milliners in order to
get a style to suit them. This method of
purchasing hats has had many disadvan
tages, the most prominent of which is the
necessity under .which a purchaser Is
obligated to buy whether the hat, after
being made to order, satisfies or not.
Which Has Made a Big: Sv ccess. '

As . soon as the certainty exists that
these pests have been utterly extermin
ated dynamiting will cease altogether,
and the lake will be restocked with black
bass and trout. The bass are already in
the Berkeley reservoir awaiting trans
planting to their new abode, and the
United States hatchery at McCloud has
undertaken to , furnish all the trout re
quired. The water from the lake shows a
decided Improvement over its former
murky condition, and for its drinking
qualities will leave nothing to be desired
as soon as the lake is allowed to settle
down' Into Its normal .quietude.
F. W. King of Berkeley has successfully
accomplished his task of ridding Lake
Chabot of the carp that have Infested its
waters and clogged â¢ its aqueducts. .The
means employed was the explosion of
large quantities of dynamite, and Mr.
Adams, the superintendent of the Contra
Costa Water Company, gave his personal
supervision to the operations. It Is esti
mated that no less than 50,000 carp have
been killed, at an expense of probably
about, $5000. .

CAPITOLA, Sept. 7.â Capltola has been
captured by the "best people on earth."
Sufficient it Is to say tHat members of the
Benevolent Protective Order of Elks
from Central California lodges have taken
possession; to add that there will be
"great doings" while they continue to run
the town would be a waste of words.
.The occasion' of this gathering of an
tlered knightsâ Elks gray and gaunt, and
Elks just sprouting horns â Is the annual
reunion, for .which the local herd has. been
preparing for weeks. Not In many moons
has there, been so much life, about this
seaside resort. Bay. .lew avenue, leading
from the station to Â¦ the . hotel, was to
night outlined by r-yriads of lanterns. At
the statlqn and at Hotel Capitola purple
and white bunting had been used very
effectively in the 'decorations.
: The special train bearing Elks from
Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose and
Stockton arrived at 6:30 o'clock. A recep
tion committee from Santa Cruz, consit
ing of H. E. Irish, M. C. Hopkins, D. C.
Clark. J. J. C. Leonard, F.. "W. Swanton
and- C. E. Lindsay, met them at the sta
tion. With the Second Regiment band
from Oakland playing "There'll Be a Hot
Time," the procession marched to Hotel
Capitola, where after a short open-air
concert dinner was served. The dining
room and parlors were elaborately deco
rated, elks', heads being conspicuous. The
lamp globes were shaded with purple.
After-dinner speeches were indulged in.
and then came the ball, given in honor of
the lodgemen by R. M. Biare. The dance
hall presented a brilliant spectacle. The
music was furnished by Callaghan's or
chestra. Dr. J.- A. Colegrove was floor di
rector and Dan J. Hallahan assistant.
To-morrow is to be^a "big day," and the
banquet will be a Joyous- affair.

Some Recent Salees.
The records of transactions for the month
just expired are wonderfully large considering
the check that has been given to all line? of
business, .' including: that of real estate. De
ducting from the total consideration that of
$1,050,000 for. the eastern half of the Blythe
block (which was a sale so far out of the a&r
mal as not to.be considered in judging of gen
eral conditions) there yet remain transfers dur
ing. August amounting to the sum of $1,358,894.
While this Is considerably less than for many
of "the previous months of this year, .which
for the first six months was an abnormal one,
still It Is one that would give gratification in
ordinary timesâ and these are extraordinary
ones. No doubt Â¦ much, of the business that
has . gone of record took place before the con
troversy between capital and labor . reached its
Â¦intense - state and that from- henceforth ; until
a settlement is reached the market will be very
dull. ' Still the- showing is gratifying as prov
ing .the latent . vitality of real estate, and
gives promise that with the resumption of nor
mal condltiona-.there will be a strong demand
for property. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ \'

ing existinz conditions that have an ef

erty is concerned, has nearly ceased," ow
ing;, to the depressing influence of the
strike; but that there is no reason for this
ejecept that large buyers believe real es
tate is not' going, to advance during the
strike and may decline if it lasts and so
have decided not to âbuy at present.
"Small buyers are as conspicuous in the
market as ever and small transactions
generally have not decreased very much
in volume. No owner has receded a dol

The Greatest of. AH
"Ihick Â¦Silk Sales
We inaugurate it on Tuesday, September 10 â Months ago we made preparations'
to make this the most remarkable Black Silk event San Francisco has ever witnessed.
We placed orders for 30,000 yards of silk direct with the, manufacturers, andwe
are now able to offer New, High Grade Imported and Domestic Black Silks at
prices such as have never been quoted before.
Similar silks were selling at full price in our stock on Saturday; and will
continue to be sold in all first-class stores at regular prices, for no store can be with-
out them and have a complete stock. . *
This is illustrated by the fact that a large part of the purchase consists of ,
Plain Black Taffetas and Plain Black Peau de Soie,
Silks that never lose their value, are always staple and wanted by every lady.
Following are the styles and prices, upon investigation of which we are positive
you will agree that no similar opportunity has ever been offered in this city. . s .

STRONG DENIAL
"To unionize all capital and to bring all
labor into a tingle trust Is to destroy
democracy by destroying individuality in
labor and commerce. The endeavor to do
this on either or both sides does great
wrong to the millions of Americans who
belong to neither band and are trying to
live their own lives and earn their own
bread as freemen in. a free man's own
fashion. DAVID STaRR JORDAN."
"The republic can recognize but one
method of political reformâ the ballot.
Those who would divide our people into
warring bands, yielding unquestioned con
trol to feudal Jeaders, are not friends of
democracy.
"Tne immediate act of yssterday is
an outcome cf the strife between
classes, imported from the Old World,
fomented by unpractical or conscience
less agitators, and abetted by that
section of the press -which values
a sensation above truth or peace or
justice. We cannot suppress ths
agitator or the journal, for force only
increases the danger. But we have a
moral duty to stand against all move
ments of whatever kind -which seek
to accomplish their ends through in
timidation or murder.
"It was once the boast of a Duke of

belong to free America. However high
political discussion might arise. It should
carryno danger to life or property. Our
servant, the President, should safely lay
his' head in the lap of the people he
serves. Our Presiden; should need no
bodyguard. The deaths of Lincoln and
Garfield were exceptions, which only
proved, the rule.

they were "generally regarded . as

BUFFALO. Sept 7.â In many
material points, and particu
larly In the utterances after
the President was shot, the
witnesses of yesterday's trag
edy at the Temple of Music
fail to agree. The action of
the tragedy was very fast and its com- '
mission was followed by a scene of confu
sion. In which it was difficult to either see
or hear -rrith accuracy, however close one
stood to the President and his assailant.
It is now conceded that the President
did not say "May God forgive him." after
he was shot, and it Is agreed that his first
audible speech was a reference to his
wife: "I trust Mrs. McKinley will not be
Informed of this. At least, I hope it will
not be exaggerated."
A newspaper reporter who stood just
behind the President when the shooting
occurred gave cne of the clearest ac
counts related so far. He Eaidi
"I stood about ten feet from the Presi
dent and saw Czolgosz approach him. .me
latter had his right hand drawn up close
to his breast ar.d a white linen handker
chief wrapped about it bore the appear
ance of a bandage. He extended his left
hand, and I am quite sure the President
thought he was injured, for he . leaned
forward and ?ool:ed at him In a sympa
thetic v.-ay. When directly in front of the
President Czolgosz threw his right hand
f orrrard and_ fired. I saw the flash and
smoke, followed* by the report, and then
I heard the second shot.** '" Â¦ :
Locks of the Assassin. .
"Instantly John Parker, a colored man,
ar.d Secret Service Agent Foster were
upon Czoljrcsz and they bore him to the
floor. Czolgosz, lying prostrate, still re
tained a hold on his revolver, and seemed
to be trying to get his arm free to flre
cprain.
"The President did not fall. He raised his
right- hand and felt of his breast and
seemed to be maintaining his upright po
sition only by wonderful effort.
"I am sure he did not sp3ak at that mo
ment. He gazed fixedly at his assailant"
with a look which I cannot describe, but
which I shall never forget, and In a mo
ment reeled back into the arms of Secre
tary Cortelyou. Czolgosz's' revolver had
by that time been knocked from his hand
and some one had picked up the burning
handkerchief which lay at his feet. Czol
gosz was picked up, forced back and
again knocked down. Mr. Cortelyou and
Mr. MUburn supported the President- and
led him to a chair. I heard him ask that
' the news be kept from his wife, and a
moment later, when" Secretary Cortelyou
asked him if he felt much pain, he said:
" 'This wound hurts very much.'
"He seemed to be fairly easy as he
rested In the chair and some of the fad
ing color came back to his face. He
reached his right hand inside of his shirt
and when he withdrew It his fingers were
tipped with blood. He paled again at the
Bight of the blood and I think he
fainted."
Alarm of Mexican Minister.
Senor Azpir^z. the Mexican Minister,
broke through the crowd and rushing up
to the President cried:
"My God, Mr. President, are you shot?"
The Minister seemed about to throw
himself at the feet of the President, but
was restrained. The President's answer
came very slowly, and In a halting, sub
dued voice he said, "Yes, I believe I am."
The President was attracted by the scuf
fling of the officers who were dragging
the would-be murderer away, but he did
not speak. His head rested on the arm
of Mr. Milfcurn, and he seemed only part
ly conscious. His courage was superb,
and while he was conscious he was the
master of the pain he suffered. When the
ambulance came and a stretcher was
brought in he started forward and partly
regained his feet unassisted. I heard not
a word from the assailant of the Presi
i f'ont. He was struck down the moment
he fired the second shot, and If he did
speak It was probably In exclamation at
the very rough treatment he was receiv
ing."

Some laymen, fearing that Czolgosz has
a chance to escape with only a few year3*
of imprisonment, have raised the ques
tion whether he can not be tried upon a
charge of treason. Chief Justice Beatty
said last evening that could not be done,
in hla opinion. The country Is not at war
and it cannot be alleged that Czolgosz has
helped the enemies of his country. When
President Lincoln was assassinated.
Payne, Herold, Atzeroth, Mrs. Surratt,
Mudd, Arnold and O'Laughlln were tried
before 'a military court, 'but the crime
was committed within the lines of . the
army and the war was ttfen going on.-
Under ordinary conditions theirs would
have been simple murder cases to be tried
by the civil courts. In the ! case of
Gulteau, who assassinated President Gar
fleld, the trial and conviction were for
murder.
Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court of California says that Czolgosz
will be tried under the laws of the State
of New York, the attempt to kill Presi
dent McKinley having taken place within
the boundaries of that State. If the *
President shall survive, the charge
against Czolgosz will be assault with at

Informally they have discussed the pos
sibility of Vice President Roosevelt be
ing called upon to act as magistrate
during the disability of the President.
But all precedents are against such a
course while the President lives.
GENERAL, 3B0OKE TAKES
It is not believed here that Roosevelt
will exercise any of the duties of the
Presidential office until something should
occur urgently requiring the personal at
tention of the chief executive, and" tha
President should be in such condition- as
to be utterly unable to act. In that event
it will be made clear to the country that
the Vice President acts on the earnest
solicitation of the Cabinet.
Former Senator Trumbull held that the
Vice President was authorized' to act In
case of disability, mental or physical,
which was known to the Vice President
when so open, notorious and indisputable
as to be recognized by all as existing.
Davis, after discussing the various views,
agreed substantially with former Gover
nor Butler that the Vice President him
self should decide when a constitutional
inability had arisen and should thereupon
enter upon the discharge of the Presiden
tial duties. . .
Professor Dwight contended that it wag
necessary for Congress to prescribe thÂ»
manner in which' proof of inability should
be established, something that Congress
has never attempted to do.
Vice President Must Decide.
Morse referred me to a pamphlet pub
lished by Henry E. Davis of the District
of Columbia bar, reviewing the discus
sion of fhe subject that was carried on
at the time President Garfleld lay wound
ed. In this pamphlet former Judge Dit
tenhoffer of New Tork is quoted as main
taining that a disability which would
justify the Vice President In acting must
be one which would completely dlsabla
him for the remainder of his term, on
which the Vice President, on his own
decision of necessity, shall become PresK
dent.
"But," he continued, "no Vice President
would think of acting In such capacity
without being requested by the President
or "Cabinet, if the President were not in
such mental. and physical condition as to
enable him to make the request."
*Will Await Cabinet Bequest.
Lander Porter Morse, a leading author
ity, said this afternoon that in his opinion
the Vice President was the judge, and
that when he believed that inability with
in the meaning of the constitution ex
"isted it was his duty to discharge the du
ties as acting President until the Presi
dent should be able to act.
The constitution says that they shall
devolve upon the Vice President, but the
constitution is silent as to what shall con
stitute "inability," and it ia silent as to
who shall decide when such inability ex
ists. "
a nature or whether the con
dition of public business is such as to re
quire him to assume the duties of the
chief executive as acting President. This
is the opinion of many excellent lawyers
who have considered the question, though
it is not the unanimous opinion of tho
profession. Until the shooting of Presi
dent Garfleld the question of what was
the proper procedure In case of the in
ability of the President to discharge the
powers and duties of his office never
arcse.

FOR McKINLEY
But there Is, work to be done, and we, the
sons of fighting sires, would be falstf to our
selves and the mission of our society , if we
chirked it. The sluggish stream of public
sentiment must be stirred until all men shall
know that license, must be divided from-lib
erty, that freedom of speech. and thought does
not mean the speech and thought of Â¦ the an
archist, and first and last and forevermore
that this beloved land shall not be the nest
ing-place of the vermin of other countries.
Mr. Treat then gave a sketch of the life
of Paul, Jones and before adjourning the
commandery appointed a committee to ar
range for the erection of a local monu
ment. :
"At the Bush street synagogue yester
day morning during the regular, service
special psalms were recited and a fervent
prayer was offered by Rabbi Isidore My
ers' for the speedy and perfect recovery
of x the President. Subsequently Rabbi
Myers preached' an impressive sermon,
taking for his text Lamentations, iv:20.
"The breath of our nostrils, the anointed
of the Lord, has been caught In their
snares, he. of whom we said. Under, his
shadow shall -we live among the nations."
He said In part:
The weight of a great ! sorrow has fallen on
the people of the Unitri â¢ States, a sorrow
shared by the whole civilized world. A das
tardly hand, Â¦ with murderous intent,- has as
sailed "the breath of our nostrils"â that is. the
very life of the state." the' symbol of Govern
ment and of the majesty of law and order, the
chief executive whose dignified and responsible
position carries with it all -that is great and
nrble in- a great and noble people: a man who
has justified the choice and confidence of the
pÂ«ople of this land by steering the ship of state
with remarkable skill and wisdom, and under
whose shadow America has come to be consid
ered pre-eminent among tne leading nations of
the world.
Mr. McKInley has proved himself a true serv
ant of God. "the anointed of the Ix>rd." by
his generous and broad sympathies, by his de
sire to promote International amity and con
cord, by his integrity and honesty of purpose,
by his sor!al and domestic virtues and by his
manifest love for the people, qualities which
have endeared him to the hearts of all sorts
and conditions of men. This great and good
man has been "caught in the snares" of the
foes of society, those misguided miscreants,
those inhuman monsters, whose dreadful dÂ»eds
from time to time send a shudder throughout
the, civilised world, whose nature is so per
verted that they can" actually glory- In heinous

BERLIN. Sept. J.-The tragedy in Buf
falo has made a deep impression. "While
the Germans first knew President Mc-
Kinley as the author of the McKinlev
bill, which they regarded as especlallv
aimed at Germany, and therefore disliked
him. that dislike has latterly given place
to a more friendly feeling and during tho
past few years the papers have said many
pleasant things about him. It is a strik
ing fact that the German press, althoue-h
generally ready to impute corruption to
every American statesman, never assails
Sentiment in Germany.
Throughout the Government offices the
.same sentiments were echoed. I In Wash
ington itself the assailant could not have
been more bitterly execrated
You cannot use terms too strong in expressing
our indignation at the outrage and sympathy
with the President. It Is terrible. If Mr.
McKInley. dies, -which we sincerely hope he will
not, the whole world will lose a man of great
er Integrity and statefimanship than it even
at present realizes. Thin latest- attempt may
load to an international arrangement by which
anarchist* may be dealt with according to
their deserts and this canker of civilization be
suppressed. Certainly England would favor
euch a plan. We and America are blamed on
th* continent for harboring anarchists
We are deeply relieved to hear the oncourae
ing reports about the President's condition, but
remembering keenly how President Garn>l<l lin
gered, we dread the possibility of complications
until the second bullet la found. If the worst
comes to the worst, which I dislike to con
template, it 13 some sllsrht satisfaction to
know that the Vice President In such an up
right, level-headed man. I don't think Euro
pean statesmen would feel a bit nervous about
his direction of affairs. We sincerely trust
however, that such a coptingency will not o~
cur.
In the absence of Lord Salisbury and
the Marquis of Lansdowne from London
Schomberg McDonnell, principal private
secretary to the Prime Minister, caid to
a representative of the press:
I have heard with sorrow and detestation of
the atrocious, cowardly act of which the Pres
ident of the United States is a victim. Every
Englishman deeÂ»ily symrathiz-s with the peo
ple of America and v.-|th the family of the
President, vhose hleh character is well ap
preciated on this skis.
It is understood that the American po
lice are communicating with the police of
the various European capitals with the
view of learning whether. Czolgosz had
relations with foreign anarchists recently.
By night the embassy had received tel
egrams from almost every city in the
United Kingdom, besides countless in
quiries from- individuals, including the
Duke of Cambridge, the Bishop of Ripon,
the foreign Embassadors and the Argen
tine Minister.
Mr. Chamberlain, the Colonial Secre
tary, wired from Birmingham:
The Sun says: "The abhorrent crime
was committed for mere -wantonness."
- The Evening News says, "That he may
be spared is the prayer of every English
man throughout the empire," and the pa
per mentions the curious resemblance in
the circumstances surrounding the crime
in Buffalo and those of the murder of
President Carnot, whose assassin climbed
to his victim's carriage for the ostensible
purpose of shaking hands.
The Echo eulogizes the personal traits
of President McKinley as those on which
Englishmen can dwell with unaffected
appreciation.
"England Prays for McKinley" is print
ed in great black type across the front
page of the Evening Star, and all the
journals express the hope of the English
people that the President will recover.

PABIS, Sept 7.â The Americans
In Paris and the French people
learned the new* of the at
tempt on the life of President
McKInley when they opened
their newspapers at the break
[ fast table this morning:. Even
. the United States EmbassaÂ£or, General
\ Horace Porter, was not aware until
; to-day of the tragedy that had . been
. enacted In Buffalo. He retired early last
; evening:, being fatigued and not feeling
Â¦ well, and he was not disturbed In the ab
sence of ah official dispatch. 'Â¦..'.
A. dispatch was sent to President Lou
' bet. vrno Is at Ramboulllet. late last night
â¢ and It was not delivered until to-day.
The news epread through Paris with the
rapidity of a whirlwind and It was dis
onssed to the exclusion of every other
; topic, not merely by Americans but bv
the Parisians. There are many Americans
Â¦topping In Paris for a few days on their
way home from other European countries,
and every hotel courtyard had Its group,
earnestly discussing the news. The United
States embassy and consulate were be
sieged by callers seeking information,
while In front of the New York Herald's
office was a great crowd awaiting bul
letins of the latest condition of the Presi
dent.
Expressions of sympathy from French
men are emanating from every side. From
the highest to the lowest every one io
anxious to express deep regret and ab
horrence at the crime. President McKin
ley's name and character are quite famil
iar to the Parisians. His honorable ca
reer and democratic character have fre
quently been dwelt upon by the press and
have made him popular here. A majority
of the newspapers published portraits this
morning of Mr. and Mrs. McKInley.
Czar to Be Well Guarded.
Everywhere In Paris Americans congre
gated at hotels, cafes and other public
places to-night and the sole subject of
-conversation continued to be the attempt
â¢upon President McKinley. The more re
assuring cablegrams received this even
ing, when they became known, caused the
liveliest satisfaction. United States Em
bassador Porter's latest advices Inspired
him with hope that Mr. McKinley's robust,
constitution would pull him through. Dis
patches from the provinces show that the
news of the crime created a profound im
pression throughout the country.
Many points of resemblance are found
In the manner In which yester

effect the outrage will have upon the visit
of Eraperor Nicholas and it Is universally
realized that the crime will have an im
portant bearing upon the arrangements
for his reception. Whatever might have
been the possibilities before, it is now con
sidered out of the question that. the Czar
will come to Paris, while during his stav
In France he will be surrounded by a
hedge of steel, so that any attempt upon
his life is already doomed to failure. The
ordinary public will not be allowed to get
anywhere near him, and the number cf
tickets issued by the Ministry of the In
terior, which will pass the holders into
the various inclosures where they wlli be
able to approach the Czar, will be cur
tailed. Photographers will be kept at a
cafe distance.
The Temps publishes a dispatch eaying
that the outrage will cause the precau
tions for the Czar's safety to be redoubled.
The police, the dispatch says, have
already refused to allow the municipality
of Bheims to erect spacious tribunes along
the route over which the Czar will pass
for the use of the councilors of the de
partment and the ordinary public and it
is feared the police will refuse to author
ize the erection of similar projected stands
tipon the streets of Compeigne.
Crime Was Without Excuse.
The Journal des Debats says of the
Buffalo eh^oting: "The crime was sense
less. It is sufficient to say that it was
the act of ?>n anarchist. We do not for
get that President McKinley In his second
Inauguration speech extended to Frapce
the favored nation treatment. Our sym
pathy goes &ot to JÂ£r. McKinley, not only
because bejs the G^ad of a friendly na
tion, but uscausg we consider him a
friend."
The Tenr=^ rÂ«Jiws President McKin
ley's imperXIirito policy and then speaks
of his recent au'urfions to reciprocity, say
ing: "We da act know whether the Sen
ate would have supported him or not. or
Â¦whether the trusts and syndicates would
not have raised the standard of revolt
As to the conquests of the Philippines,
Cuba and Porto Rico, it is certain that
every day reveals more contradictory and
tmsolvable embarrassments, and the role
of Mr. McKinley has been far from en
viable."
General Porter said: "It is appalling to
think that this miscreant should strike
down such a man. whose high moral char
acter and political Integrity endear h!m
to all his fellow countrymen. Something
must be done to disarm the dastardly as
sassins. The system by which the Presi
dent of the United States is allowed to
â¢.-ontinually expose himself to the hand of
ihe assassin must be modified and greater
protection given him."
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts arrived
In Paris yesterday from a trip to Russia
and Germany. He heard the news this
morning and said to a correspondent:
â¢ "I am aghast. It seems incredible that
he. the representative of a free country
and himself so deservedly popular, should
be chosen for the sacrifice by these an
archistic fiends. I agree with General
Porter that our Presidents should be sur
rounded by greater protection and the
severity of the laws against anarchists
fehould be increased."

BALTIMORE, Md.. Sept. 7.â Governor
John Walter Smith this "afternoon issued
a proclamation calling upon good citi
zens of Maryland to join in giving thanks
for the escape of President McKinley
from Immediate death at the hands of an
assassin and praying for his restoration
to health. Tuesday of next" week . is . the
day appointed by the Governor.
"I am in correspondence with the stats
authorities of three European countries,
who have written to me saying that their
secret service men have found that plans
to assassinate conspicuous political fig
ures in their respective countries have
recently been hatched In Paterson. I will
â¢not give the names of the heads that are
supposed to be thus- threatened, for- that
would defeat my scheme to ascertain
whether the murderous, plots were really
originated inr New Jersey. But I am de
termined that- the name of Â¦ New Jersey
shall no longer be associated abroad or at
home with such dastardly plots."
"Certainly the time has come for us to
call a halt to anarchy and all anarchists
in this country. This incubation of red
handed a*ssassins and king-killers on
American soil has gone too far. It will
be stopped in New Jersey. I can give
that assurance here and now.
"A law is being prepared and will be
enacted by the next Legislature beyond
the remotest shadow of a. doubt that will
till the bill completely. It will allow us to
prosecute participants in any conspiracy
in New Jersey that results. directly or in
directly in the assassination of any ruler
the world over, or the murder of any
person In or out cf Xew Jersey. The
conspirators will be treated as accessories
before the fact and the charge will be
murder. If convicted they will suffer Just
the same punishment as if they were con
victed of aiding and abetting In any or
dinary case cf murder.

"The fact that the wtound was received
as late as 4:10 p. m., probably some hours
after lunch and before dinner, the stom
ach being comparatively empty, is in his
favor. It is difficult to find statlstk-s
based on a large number of cases with
wounds of this character, but in a gen
eral way it may be said that recoveries
average about 50 per cent. With a ma:i
like -President McKinley. it Is safe to say
thafthe percentage of chances in his fa*
vor are much greater than this. Cases
with numerous perforations of the stom
ach and intestines, even accompanied by
wounds of the liver and kidneys, have re"
covered." â¢
In response to a request from the Asso
ciated Press for an "opinion as to the
probable result of the President's wound.
Surgeon General Wyman of the marine
hospital service said:
"The fact that the President was in
such good health: that skilled surgical
assistance -was immediately available*
that the necessary operation was net
postponed, and the fact that the percent
age' of recoveries in similar cases is large
all give ground for anticipating a favora
ble result.
BUFFALO, Sept. 7. â The operation upon
the President last night lasted almost an
hour. Ether was administered. A five
inch incision was made where the ball
entered the abdomen and Its course -was
followed until the physicians became sat
isfied that the kidneys had not, been
touched or -the intestines perforated and
that It had lodged probably In the muscles
of the back, where it could do no harm
for the present. The Intestines were lift
ed out through the incision and carefully
examined, and the utmost confidence ex

cians were exceedingly gratified at the
result and pronounced the operation a
complete success. '

Fate of the Assassin.
CHICAGO, Sept. 7.â Chicago anarchists,
In response to a call issued three days
ago, held a meeting last night in a saloon
on West Chicago avenue and discussed
the attempted assassination of the Presi
dent. Men and women known to be as
sociated with the anarchists' movement
In the city were in the barroom. The at
tendance at the meeting showed that it
was no impromptu gathering. Over . 200
persons were gathered in Jthe hall. Three
daye ago the members of several societies
were notified that a celebration would
take place last night. The reason for the
issuance of the call for the meeting could
not be learned from those present. They
made no secret of the fact that they an
ticipated something of which they might
talk, however. Not a word of sympathy
for the man who was near his death was
heard at the meeting last night. Instead
there were speeches in which the name of
McKinley was mentioned only to bring
forth cries of condemnatidh. For the
name of the President's assailant there
were cheers.
All the speeches were in German, al
though at times some members of the
audience would give vent to their feel
ings in English. It was not until early
this morning that the meeting, broke up.
Chicago Anarchists Meet.
The family is Polish and evidently very
poor, the father having left home Satur
day morning looking for employment.
The stepmother cannot speak English,
but gave out the following interview
through the medium of an interpreter:
"Leon left home about sixty days ago.
We heard from him a few weeks ago. He
was then in Indianapolis and wrote to us
that he was going away, stating that In
all probability we would not see him
again."
The stepmother failed to recollect the
name of the city from which the letter
was received, but states that it was some
place in Indiana. The family had not
heard from him since. The stepmother
denies that Leon was a disciple of Emma
Goldman or in any way interested in her
doctrines. She said he was not interested
in such matters, and was scarcely Intelli
gent enough to understand them. They
had always considered the boy partially
demented. Up to three years ago he had
worked at the Cleveland Rolling Mill, but
had to quit on account of poor health.
Since that tima he has been Idle. While
living on the farm near Warrensville his
father had not asked Leon to work, hav
ing always considered him too weak for
manual labor. Regarding the shooting
of the President, Mrs. Czolgosz said:
"I can't believe that Leon is the one.
He was such a timid boyâ so . afraid of
everything. Why, he was the biggest
coward vou ever saw in your life."
She also emphatically disclaims that the
boy everr displayed any anarchistic ten
dencies whatever. He was an admirer of
his brother, the Philippine soldier, and
liked his country, never showing the least
sign of discontent. Mrs. Czolgosz is an
intelligent looking woman, Lut failed to
show any decided emotion when confront
ed with the account of Leon's horrible
crime. The home is neat and cleanly, but
P paiil Czolgojz, the father, moved- Into
Cleveland two weeks ago to secure em
ployment. He has -not yet heard of his
son's crime. Two uncles also live in
Cleveland, one of them residing at 12
Hosmer street.

Paul Czolgosz, the father of Leon, was
seen at his home at 3?6 Fleet' street to
day. He did not appear to be deeply con
cerned ' over the enormity of his son's
crime and . was calmly stropping a- razor
with which he had .lust shaved himself.
His wife was busily engaged in her
household duties, from, which she de

He has a brother, Jacob, who was In
jured by an explosion at the Sandy Hook
Navy Yard two years ago, and who has
since been retired on a Government pen
sion.' ) " Â¦
The idea of a plot being hatched in this
city to kill the President Is not given
serious thought by the police nor by those
who â¢ have known Czolgosz for the past
ten years. They regard his desperate
deed as the result of a sudden Inspiration
to do something to attract public notice.
Among his own brothers and sisters he
was considered "strange," and a sister
in-law not long ago commented upon his
childish conduct. Â¦ ,
Shortly after coming to this city, fifteen
years ago, Leon's father started a saloon.
In the rear of which was a small building
used as a rendezvous and meeting place
for a dozen or fifteen" men who called
themselves anarchists. Leon was too
youngr to be a member of that' gang, but
he was a great listener to the harangues
that these men indulged in. and they
probably had some effect on his youthful
mind. â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦
Leon worked in a rolling mill for several
years, but the work was too hard for
him, and he left to so on Tils father's
farm. Then lung trouble developed, and
he finally became more or less of an idler,
his hefrith never gaining robust condition.
His effeminacy was the cause of more
or less comment among his acquaintances.
Finally he, left home and became a wan
derer. The last definite information from
him was a letter received from West Sen
eca, N. Y., written on the loth of July.
That letter was written to the secretary
of a fraternal society in Cleveland and 'was
for the purpose of paying his monthly
assessments. So far as his relatives and
friends know, he has been nowhere else
than in West Seneca since that date.
CLEVELAND, Sept. 7.â Perhaps to no
one else Is the would-be assassin of Pres
ident McKinley more a surprsle than to
those who knew Leon Czolgosz during
his residence of a half-dozen years or
more in the southeastern end of this city.
The unhappy inmate of a home from
which his mother had been taken by
death, he never got along with his father's
second wife, and acted more or
less the stubborn boy in his re
lations with her. During this time
his father lived on a .farm with his
large family of seven boys and two girls.
Leon was not active in farm work, seem
ing to despise it as the drudgery incident
to life. '

CALL BUREAU. 140S G STREET, N.
W.i WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Plunged In
bitter grief by the dastardly crime In
Buffalo, one clear note in Washington's
general discord of woe Is the demand that
assassins banded under the name of anar
chists be crushed as ruthlessly as one
crushes other venomous things; that every
"red" now blotting this land be tounted
from It!
Discussing the punishment provided by
the statute for an attempt upon the Ufa
of a President of this republic, James M.
Beck, acting Attorney General, said there
is no statute which makes an attack
upon the President's life any graver of
fense than such an attack upon any other
citizen.
"'It is passinsr strange," said Mr. Beck,
"that notwithstanding the fact that two
Presidents have been assassinated and at
tempts have been made upon the lives of
two more no ".aw has ever been passed to
place an attempt on the life of the Presi
dent on. the same plane as high treason.
Where such an attempt had no reference
to the Presidential office and was commit
ted within the territorial limits of a State
there might be some question as to the
power of Congress to legislate, but where
it is clear that the attempt has been made
not upon the individual, but upon the.
President, for the purpose of promoting"
anarchy and thus subverting government,
the right of the Federal Government to
protect its chief executive seems to be too
clear for question.

Treason.
Suggestion Is Hade That Attack oxs
WOULD CRUSH
THE ANARCHISTS
"Seme of the men, 1 learned,- have
served terms In prisons in their native
countries for attempted crimes, inspired
by their anarchistic beliefs. â¢ The Free
Society, published by Isakk, I have
learned, was formerly issued on the Pa
cific Coast, and it was only recently that
IsaKk opened an orflce here.".
Captain Colicran said the prisoners
would be held pending a further exam
ination to-day. â¢
The examination of the prisoners lasted
until early this morning, but the police
refused to make public what information
had been secured. Captain Colleran,
chief of the detective bureau, however,
gave out the following:
"The raid was made In consequence of a
telegram from secret service officers in
Euffalo asking us to investigate and learn
the whereabouts of the headauarters of a
paper known as the Free Society. We
traced the owner to the house at 515 Car
roll avenue, and there found the persons'
arrested, apparently in the midst of an
important meeting. All of the prisoners
admit tliey are anarchists, and do not
hesitate to say that they have no regard
lor the laws as now enforced. , Â¦
CHICAGO. Sept. 7.â The names of the
men arrested last night on the charge of
being implicated in the plot to assassinate
President McKinley are: Abraham Isakk,
Abraham Isakk Jr., Nippolyte Havel,
Henry Trcvegilo, Clemens Pfeutzner and
A'fred Schneider.
dictment for assault in the first degree,
act of Congress prescribing a penalty
for offen&es against the person of the
President or other United States officials
would, according to legal authorities, take
precedence of the Penal Code of 'the State
of New York in the case of the man who
made the attempt on President McKin
ley's life. A search of the enactment
has been made by Congress. It would
not be impossible to inflict any greater
punishment on the anarchist Czolgosz by
any act of the Legislature fixing a more
severe penalty for an attempt on the life
of the President. The death of the Presi
dent would result in the trial of the as
sailant for homicide, and his conviction
would mean death in the electric chair.
Moran Is not inclined to believe that the
shooting of President McKinley yester
day was the result of a conspiracy. He
believes it was the individual act of
Czolgosz. At the same time he is tak
ing steps to have the secret service men
co-operate with the local detective and
police forces at all cities where Czolgosz
has lived with a view to ascertaining
whether any anarchistic organization was
involved in the crime.
Chief of the Secret Service Wilkie was
at his summer home in Wisconsin yester
day when the President was shot. Mo
ran telegraohed him at once, and he left
on the next train for Washington, where
he will arrive to-morrow or Monday.
Major Richard Sylvester, superintend
ent of the Washington police, and Presi
dent of the Police Association of the
United States and Canada, took the first
steps to-day designed to bring about the
co-operation of police officials to securs
the enactment of laws which will ena
ble anarchistic societies and Individuals
toÂ«be dealt with more effectually. He sent
a letter to the board of directors of the
association to-day urging- that members
give this matter close and careful con
sideration, and offer such suggestions aa
will enable the association to act ef
fectually.
FAMILY PHYSICIAN. OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY, WHO IS AMONG
THE NOTED DOCTORS IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE UPON THE
WOUNDED CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT BUFFALO. '
"It is incorrect, as has been stated, that
the least fear of an assault was enter
tained by .the Presidential party. It has
been my custom to stand . back i of the
President and just to his left, so that I
could see the right: hand of every .person
approaching, but yesterday. I was re
quested to stard opposite the President
so that Mr. Milburn could stand at the
left and introduce the people who ap
proached. In that way I-was unable to
get a good look at ; every one's right hand.
"A few moments before Czolgosz ap
proached a ir.an "came along with three
fingers of bis, right hand tied up in a
bandage and he had shaken hands with
his left. When Czolsosz came up I no
ticed he was a boyish looking fellow with
an Innocent Â¦ face, perfectly calm, and I
also noticed that his ..-. right hand was
wrapped in v/hat appeared to be a band
age.- I watched hrfn closely but was in
terrupted by the man in front of him,
who held on to the .President's hand an
unusually long time. This man appeared
to be an Italian and wore a short, heavy
black mustache. He^was persistent, and
it was necessary for me to push him along
so that the others could reach the Presi
dent. Just as he released the President's
hand and as the PresidenUwas reaching
for the hand ; of the assassin there were
two quick shots. Startled for a moment,
I looked and saw the President draw his
right hand up under his coat, straighten
up and pressing his lips togethei give
Czolgosz . the most scornful and con
temptuous look possible to imagine.

In an interview Secret Service Detective
Ireland, who with Qfiicer Gallagher was
near the President when the shots were
fired, said:
"This man has admitted shooting the
President. He says he Intended to kill;
that he had been planning to do it for
the last three daysâ since he came here.
He went to the Temple of Music with
murder in his heart, intending to shoot to
kill. He fixed up his hand by tying a
handkerchief around it and waited his
turn to get near the President. When he
KOt directly in front of the President he
fired. He says he had no confederate
that he was entirely alone in the plarr*
ning and execution of this diabolical act.
He says he is a believer in the theories
propounded by Emma Goldman, whom he
heard several times. He does not believe
in our form of government, and therefore
he deemed it his duty to get rid of the
President."
To a reporter. District Attorney Penney
gave the substance of Czolgosz's confes
sion, as follows:
The prisoner was kept secluded to-day,
and as a result of a suggestion from Sec
retary of War Root the police inquiry
will be as soon as possible. No one is
permitted to see the prisoner other than
his immediate rustodians, and his confes
sions, taken down in writing, will not be
made public, for the present at least. The
prisoner has not retained counsel, and
when the subject was mentioned to him
to-day he said he did not desire a lawyer
to defend him. The police said that when
he got over, the idea that he was -& great
hero among his fellow anarchists he
would very likely resort to the usual
means to avoid punishment for his crime,
whatever time shows it to be. No one
who ever knew him made application to
see him to-day, and no word came to
him from his relatives. He had a couple
of dollars when r.rr^sted. and to-day
asked that it be expended for a new
shirt. His request was granted, and he
spent some time in rearranging his dress.
The police made another search of his
room and effects but found nothing that
would throw any light on the crime.
The police said to-night that they had
made no other arrests and that they had
none In contemplation. It is evident that
they have not made much progress to
ward the establishment of their theory
with material evidence, and that their
chief reliance at present is on a confes
sion from the prisoner. Czolgosz's trail
has been taken up at Cleveland and it is
expected that inquiry there will let in
some valuable 'light as to his companions
and possible fellow conspirators.
The general theory now held by the de
tectives is that a circle of Czolgosz's as
sociates plotted the murder of President
McKinley. and that he was picked by lot
or induced by persuasion to carry out the
conspiracy. They say that he lacks the
shrewdness to have planned and executed
the crime as he did.
In addition to the examination to which
the prisoner was subjected city and Fed
eral detectives spent the day in scouring
the city for some trace of possible con
federates. They took up the trail of the
prisoner from the day of his arrival and
partially completed an outline of his
movements up to the commission of tne
crime. They did not succeed in connect
ing him with any of the socialists who
make their home here, and by nightfall
had about abandoned the theory that he
was assisted by any. one.. here._ They also
showed an inclination to give up the be
lief that a confederate preceded the pris
oner In the reception line leading up to
the President, but work along that line
had not been abandoned.

The admission that he had discussed the

drawn from him, but there he stopped

hands of a group of shrewd examiners
and they set trap upon trap. to catch him,
but the effort to break him down failed.
The police say that in the end, when he
comes to a true appreciation ot his posi
tion,' he will break down and confess. In
reviewing his confession he made open
avowal of his belief in anarchy and said
that he had merely' done his duty as he
saw it.
When he was first brought before Su
perintendent of Police Bull and District
Attorney Penney he was not disposed to
talk very freely, and when a.question was
put to him took ample time to weigh his
answers deliberately. He mixed, with his
answers some philosophy of the desperate
political sect to which he belongs and
seemed to be posing. Later his tongue

the afternoon he talked freely.

the prisoner was fruitless, save in so' far
as his own individual fate Is concerned,
for while he told nothing that would im
plicate any one else in his crime, he went
over the scene' at the Temple of Music
when he shot the President again and
again, completing a confession as ample
as the law ever exacted. . He even- went
to the extent of illustrating to the officers

he cameâ the President, the rulerâ and I
got in line and trembled and trembled
until I got right up to him and then I
chot him twice through my white hand
kerchief. I would have fired more but I
Â¦was stunned l.y a blow in the face, a
frightful blow that knocked me down,
and then everybody, jumped on me. I
thought I womc! be killed and was sur
prised the way they treated me."
Czolgosz en led his story in utter ex
haustion. When he had about concluded
he was asked:
"Did you really mean to kill the Presi
dent?"
"I did," was the cold blooded reply.
"What was your motive, what good
could it do you?" he was asked.
"I an an anarchist. I am a disciple of
Emma Goldman. Her words set me on
fire," he replied, with not the slightest
tremor. "I deny that I have had an ac
complice at any time," Czolgosz told Dis
trict Attorney Penny. "I don't regret my
act, because I was doing what I could for
the preat cause. I am not connected with
the Paterson group or with those anarch
ists who sent Bresci to Italy to kill Hum
bert. I had no confidants; no one to help
me I was alone absolutely."
Emma Goldman's Malevolence.
Emma Goldman, the prophetess of the
"Reds." the woman who was sentenced
to serve a year in prison for "inciting to
riot" In 1S33, who has written books an-I
lectured in all the large cities of the Un
ion and who is even more rabid in dell
enee of the Government than Herr Most,
is an insignificant person In appearance.
She is below five feet in height and slen
der In build. She would be passed with
out notice in an ordinary throng. But
k. "when she mounts a platform to speak she
" trains attention at once. Her voice Is.
strong and clear, and her sincerity Is be
yond question.
Not only does she attract true anarch
ists but many rocialists to hear her ex
pound the principles of their faith. She
is fearless in denunciations, not stopping
short of sacrilege in abusing all forms of
government. In a recent speech she al
luded to the Diety as "the old gentleman
Â¦who employs full stomached idlers,
priests, rabbis and ministers to mind his
business." She attacks the press at every
opportunity and charges it with responsi
bility for most of the evils of society.
She has spoken mockingly of President
McKinley. as of every other head of a
nation or a government. Her hearers she
**alls "fools and slaves." and tells the
â¢workingman that he ought to be shot
down for not asserting his rights by force
if every other means fails. "Freedom,
freedom!" is her cry. and she figuratively
â¢waves a red flag and firebrand as she
pays it.
It was in October, 1S93. that Mis3 Gold
xnan was convicted in New York for in
citing to riot. She was sent to Black
wells Island and her term of imprison
ment was reduced to ten months on ac
count of good behavior. When she was
freed she wrote and sold an account of
â¢ her Imprisonment and the manner in
Â¦which prisoners are treated on the Island.
Then she made a lecture tour, visiting
*>very large city from Boston to San
Francisco.

CHICAGO, Sept. 7.-A special 13
the Daily News from Buffalo
says: The statement of Leon
Cscij-ot-s made to the police,
transcribed and signed by the
prisoner, i? aÂ«? follow?:
"I was born in Detroit nearly
twemy-rJne years ago. My parents were
Russian Poles. They came here fcrty
two years ago. 1 got my education in the
public fchonip of Detroit and then went
to Cleveland, where I cot work. In
Cleveland I read books en socialism and
met a great many socialists. ,1 was pretty
jwell known as a socialist in the West.
After being In Cleveland for several years
I went to Chicago, where 1 remained
peven months, after which I went to New
burg, on the outskirts of Cleveland, and
went to work In the Newburg wire mills.
"During the last five years I have had
us friends anarchists in Chicago, Cleve
land, Detroit and other Western cities,
iind Lsuppcse I became more or less bit
ter. Yes, I know I was bitter. I never
had much luck at anything and this prey
ed upon me. It made me morose and en
vious, but what started the craze to liill
was a lecture I heard some little time
ago by Emma Goldman. She was in
Cleveland and I ar.d other anarchists
went to hear her. She set me on fire.
Her doctrir.e that all rulers should be ex
terminated v/as what set me to thinking.
t"o that my head nearly ppiit with the
pain. Miss Goldman's words went right
through me, and when I left the lecture
3 made up my mind that I would have to
do something heroic fcr the cause I loved.
"ElETht days ago, while I was in Chi
cago, I read in a Chicago newspaper of
President McKinley's visit to the Pan-
Ajnerican Exposition at Buffalo. That
oay I bought a ticket for Buffalo and got
here with the determination to do some
thing-, but I did not know just what. I
Thought of shooting the President, but I
bad not formed a plan. 1 went to live at
1078 Broadway, v.hich is a saloon and ho
tel. John Nowak. a Pcle, a sort of poli
tician, who has led his people here for
years, ojkns it. I told Xowak that I came
to see tne fair. He knew nothing about
what was ceiling me crazy. I went to
the exposition grounds a coujile of times
a. day.
"Not until Tuesday morning did the
resolution to shoot the President take
hold ot me. It was in my heart; there
was no escape for mo. I could not have
t-onquered it had my life been at stake.
There were thousands of people in town
on Tuesday. I heard it was President's
day. All these people seemed bowing to
the great ruier. I made up my mind to
kill that ruler. I bought 1 a 32-caliber re
volver and loaded it. On Tuesday night
I went to the fair grounds and was near
the railroad gate wherr the Presidential
party arrived.
The attendance af these meetings on
Sunday runs usually from fifty to a hun
dred persons, and the doctrines. of anar
chism and communism are freely dis
cussed. Strangers" are invited to attend
these meetings and participate in the de
bates with a view of making, converts.
Several rallying places are located about
the city, where the anarchists meet: at
odd times in small groups, but investig:i-
Uon fails to reveal any place other than
the foregoing where, the anarchists will
admit they meet a3 an organized body.
The local anarchist colony has been re
cruited mainly, from .European sources.

that city made it too hot for them. No

"San , Franciscoâ Independent Debating
Club meets every Sunday, 2 p.m., at &J0
Market street. Free discussion."'
"The club has no regular officers or or
ganization, for we do not believe in that.
The chairman is drawn from the body of
the people, by the people themselves. Tile
meetings are open, and any one can com*?
and listen to our debates. Here we know
nothing of the plans. of other bodies of
so-called anarchists: We are anarchists?
who are studying the philosophy of our
doctrines and are satisfied that our theory
of government is the 'correct one. \Vo
eannot be responsible, for the actions of
an insane man, and we feel it is an in
justice to blame anarchists for all the
political 'crimes of a century.".
In the list of meetings of the recognized
anarchist- organizations that appear in
Free Society is the following:
"In San Francisco," said Rieger last
night, "there ire between 200 and 500 an
archists. ., We' have had that many to
gether at the times we celebrated the an
niversaries of the executions of the Hay
market martyrs in Chicago, and en the
occasions of the visits of Emma Goldman
and Herr Johann Most. We have no reg
ular organization in San Francisco, but
on Sundays the Independent- Debating
Club meets in Pythian Castle, and there
you will hear a j true exposition of an
archism.
Rieger is a small man with a tawny
beard, who .does not attempt to deny that
he is an anarchist, but rather glories in
the fact, claiming that Herbert Spencer
was the greatest anarchist the world ever
knew. .
At 232 Larkin street Richard Rieger con
ducts an unpretentious bookstore, where
all varieties of literature are dispensed.
He is the collector for a number of an
archist papers throughout the United
States, and especially for Free Society,
formerly the Firebrand, of Chicago, which
publishes hisr name among the list of its
agents who are authorized to receive and
receipt for subscriptions. There are other
journals of the same character for which
Rieger collects, and he says that during
the year he collects from about 200 per
sons.
Within a stone's throw of the City. Hall
is located the headquarters of the anarch
ists of San Francisco. It is In a little
bookstore, and its proprietor is as mild
mannered a man in conversation as ever
embraced the tenets of an organization
that makes murder its motto and Em
perors, Kings, Presidents and minor of
flcia's its subjects. Police officers pass the
place daily but as yet have not had cause
to descend upon the place whence the in
flaming literature of anarchism is dis
tributed.

tion With the Plots to Com

ANARCHISTS OF
SAN FRANCISCO
"Undoubtedly something could be done,
but I believe that the secret service should
be grreatly enlarged and given 'supervision
over groups-or bodies of men 'who plot
against the form of our gdvernment and
against the officials of the Government."
Acting Chief of the Secret Service
Assistant Secretary Ailles of the Treas
ury Department, when asked whether he
thought Congress could enact laws that
would reach anarchists in this country,
said:
Need for More Officers.
"Every one attending anarchist meet
ings should be taken out and, if aliens,
deported. If citizens, .they should be
promptly tried for their offense, but in
any event the authorities should prevent
the assembling of such characters. They
do not advocate- reform nor redress of
grievances of any kind. They applaud
murder, and the man who applauds mur
der is himself a murderer at heart and
should be punished."
"Immigration laws," he said, "can be
amended to exclude from landing in. this
country any one known to be an anarchist
and every immigrant should be obliged to
present a certificate from the municipality
in which he resides at home to the effect
that lie was a respectable, law-abiding
man, that he was not in any way identi
fied with any anarchist organization and
that he was of good character. In order
to make such a law effective representa
tives of the immigration bureau should be
stationed in foreign countries from which
immigrants come whose duty it should be
to examine carefully into the character of
immigration tending toward the United
States.
Â¦ "I recommended in my annual report
for the fiscal year 1900 that all persons
landing in this country be liable to de
portation during the term they reside here
before becoming naturalized, Â» or for the
period of five years. The law should be
so framed as to enable the authorities to
place the strong hand of justice upon
every anarchist who breeds / such senti
ments as Emma Goldman gave expression
to and deport them at once.
Greater Care Will Be Taken.

J. Ransch finally managed to leave the
rr.r.ideii class, getting home first on Lap
idus, second choice in the first running
event at six furlongs. Ransch got away
first and. leading throughout, beat Lou
Clleveden a length. Burdock finished
third, with the favorite, Catherine Bravo,
b&ck in the ruck. Lost Girl and Clarando
â¢were left. ' . Â¦ '
The favorite, ably handled by Jack
Groom, made short work of it, passing
off three pretty heats, always In the lead,
in 2:11JÂ£. 2:10?; and 2 :10Vi. His faultless

paraphernalia with the exception of skin
boots, waa greatly admired, and he was
easily the star of the day.
W. G. Layng, who thinks he has in Sir
Albert S a coming two-minute horse, fell
heir to the $800 purse for the pacing num
ber, there being nothing able to dispute
the prowess of the Diablo horse. One or
two pools were sold, and that was all.
Neither did the Futurity, valued at
$2250, cause much excitement. Five very
ordinary two-year-olds lined up, the play
being confined chiefly to Ab Stemier'R
Divina, the 1 to 2 favorite. For a short
season only Royalty, the Sink entry, sput
tered out in the lead and then faded
away. When Russell on the favorite got
ready he assumed the front position,
beating Waterscratch and Doreen in rag
time.
A very tame affair was the Vinctor
stake, for all ages, at a mile. Only four
answered post call, and Vesuvian, carry-
Ing Kanscn and 122 pounds, had a 4 to 5
call in the ring. To a pretty start Hey
Dare and Vesuvian went out and made
the running for three-quarters of the trip.
When straightened out for the wire
Ransch let the favorite down and he
romped in the easiest sort of a winner in
1:42. two seconds slower than the time
made by Vinctor. Rey Dare, of whicn
much was expected, tired perceptibly, loa
ing the place to Byron Rose. Grafter and
Wardman were never in the hunt. .
As on previous days, the fields were
evenly balanced, furnishing very ' few
actual . contests. The pacing Â¦ stake was
declared off, and Sir Albert S took the 2:17
class pace in a hop, step and jump, ut
terly outclassing the other starters. To
fill out six running events were placed on
the programme, of which number favor
ites won four and the books received a
slight touching up. J, Ransch finally
played in better saddle luck, finishing in
front astride the first three winners.

IF their work in the rundown is a cri
terion, the dogs that are .-still, in the
Futurity. stake?, which. Is now.In pro
gress at Union Park, will make the
finishing louhds of the event more
than interesting, to say the. least. The'fa
vored ones, with few exceptions, came up
to expectations. True, Amadee, one of
the strongest in choice, was put out, and
a course or two went wrong for the wise
ones, but as a rule the' odds were figured
about right.
Â¦Freeze Out. the stake favorite, did not
.run with that dash which has character
ized her previous performances, and
though explanations were freely offered
the tendency of her backers to break
away was manifested after her showing.
It was given ou.t that because of having
nothing to beat in the rundown she was
eased up in her work, but will be fit and
ready to-day. Cold Shivers, her brother,
has gained a following and is a good sec
ond choice.
Probably the most interesting of the
goes was that between Aeolus and Royal
Archer. The brindle youngster was choice
at 4 to 1, but there was enough Archer
money to maku the talent cut the price
a bit. Though Aeolus showed fast and
clever, what luck there was In the course

The third game between Oakland and
Sacramento resulted In â¢ another victory
for the Dudes, who are just at present
floating* about on a wave of prosperity.
The score was as close as it could be, and
after the first inning remained unchanged.
Strlcklett was In the box for the Sena
tors and although he was not hit hard
and the Dudes scored but a single run the
tally list of Oakland Â¦ would have been
large if the Dudes had not displayed such
a fine quality of stupidity In base-running.
In the first Streib made tne initial bag
on Courtney's error, went to second when
the play was between first and third to
catch Babbitt, and scored on Eagan's hit.
After that there were no runs on either
side.

Y^WT%' WITHOUT
WEAKNESS.
There is no such condition as weakness in a
man under fifty years of age, other than gen-
eral debility. Prematurenes*. loss of vitality,
etc., are but symptoms of some damage to the
reproductive system. In looking for the loca-
tion of this iamace we generally find an en-
larreo, swollen and inflamed prostate eland.
Ae this pland is the very center ot thÂ» repro-
ductive rystem it can readily be understood
that inflainmation of it must cause disordered
function. These cases are promptly benefited
by prcper treatment, otherwise the patient
jroes firm bad to worse. The essential point
in all of them is the necessity of the cure of
the locus of the trouble in the prostate. Many
men ha\e unsuccessfully treated for a weak-
ness and become discouraged, when If an anti-
phlogistic plan of treatment had been adopted
instead of tonics, a cure would have been the
remit. In our experience there is no drug in
She Pharmacopeia, taken Into the stomach
that will even benefit this class of cases. Our
plan of treatment is entirely a local, one and
prompt results are obtained, as Indicated by
JncreaÂ«e<l circulation and return of natural
vigor. Our colored chart, which we mail on
epplication. IS Interesting to any one wishing
to study the anatomy of the male.
Contracted Disorders.
Unfier the treatment pursued before irriga-
tions were established, six weeks was deemed
the duration of an acute contracted disorder.
If It proceeded beyond elr weeks it was con-
*l<Jered to have gone Into chronic condition,
i'rorr. statistics compiled from our practice In
the past five years, covering over 6500 cases.
â¢we can show that 90 per cent of our patients
Â¦have recovered In fourteen days or less. It Is
th-refore. - equally proper to hold that a ca*e
not entirely cured within two weeks must be
considered a chronic one. and some complica-
tion haÂ» arisen, for which the patient should
tee a nwciallst. We invite free consultation
on this subject, and offer aa experience of over
twenty years; in fact, we can positively assert
that wÂ« have never failed to cure in a single
Instance.

SOFT, GLOSSY HAUL
It Can Only Be Had Where There Is
Any man or woman who wants soft,
glossy hair must be free â¢ of dandruff,
which causes falling hair. Since it has be-
come known thJit dandruff is a germ dis-
ease the old hair preparations, were
mostly scalp irritants,' have been aban-
doned, and the public, barbers and doc-
tors included, have taken to using New-
bro's Herpicide, the "only hair prepara-
tion that kills _the dandruff germ. E.
Dodd, Dickinson, N. D., says: "Herpicide
not only cleanses the scalp from dandruff
and prevents, the hair's falling out. but
promotes a new growth. Herpicide keeps
my hair very glossy." Â¦ < â¢ â¢ '. .

The monthly open meeting of PlckwlcK
Lodge of the Sons of St. George on the 2d
Inst. was, notwithstandingr the fact that
It was a legal holiday, well attended, and
the programme, a scratch one, the sev
eral numbers being by those present, was
the equal of many that have required
many days In preparation. There weret
present several' members of other lodges
and a number of strangers, who wanted
to see a jolly English gathering. Several
of the strangers contributed to tho even
ing's enjoyment. Mr. Pope recited orig
inal verses, which were meritorious, and
these, with the recitations of Brandon and
Fisher, were pleasing features. The best
non-musical number was an anecdote by
H. Digby Johnston, L.L. IX, of his early
practice at the bar. It was racy, humor
ous and well worded. Messrs. St. John,
Walker, Gerrans, Fisher and Prior fa
vored with vocal solos, all excellent rendi
tions, but Mr. St. John, who Is a retired
English soldier who has served In all
parts of the world, was able to put a
great deal of feeling In "Tommy Atkins,"
and he was encored again and again. Mr.
Potter of Burnaby Lodge and Midship
man Wood also favored with songs, after
which Mr. Wood and four othep- middies
gave a "chanty" in fine style. During tha
evening the instrumental accompaniments
were by Messrs. Hughes, Gerran and
Brandon Jr., and the committee served re
freshments of the old English sort â ala
and brown stout, and to keep this com
pany there was bread and cheese.

There was no further change worthy of note
In Potatoes. The feeling was weak. Although
the edge is taken off from the keen shipping
demand which has prevailed for a month bacK
dealers still report the usual 1 shipping ordeis
for this time of the year, hence the market
is by no means dull. Receipts continua liberal
though they have been falling off for several
days. Â¦ Â¦ â¢
Onions rule steady, as the Australian demand
consumes) much of the arrivals. .
There is nothing new in Vegetables, the mar

the occurrence of the traeiedy only shortly after
the close of yesterday's market and the added
Interval duÂ© to the closing of the London Stock
Exchange to-day were hailed with eome de
gree of relief by the financial world. The great
powers in the financial world itot to work
ebortly after UÂ»e news wae received yesterday
and have been in consultation and active ses
eion at intervals ever since. Assurances were
given, that the tanks were as one in their
re&dlness to meet the situation and protect
ttch other. It wu predicted that no solvent
or responsible borrower should lack credit to
meet his needs. This attitude and the fact
that the committee almost Immediately ad
journed had a marked effect In creating con
fidence. The first heavy selling of stocks was
therefore absorbed an<i the severe opening de
clines running from 3 to over 6 points were
quickly diminished. There Beemed to be a
feeling that it vu safe to withdraw eome sup
port from the market and not to attemot to
combat a moderate downward tendency, which
â¢was fully warranted by the actual situation.
The withdrawal of the support found the mar
ket vulnerable again, when the severe Inroads
upon thÂ« eurplus reserves disclosed by the bank
statement caused a renewal of acute uneasiness
over tbe money situation. It was felt to be
beyond question that the banks were encroach
ing upon their legal re*erve, the reserve being
designed in fact to meet Just such a crisis.
But futurÂ« curtailment of credits in recupera
tion of the reserve Is thereby made necessary.
As a measure of the sentiment caused by the
attempted assassination of the President the
cay 'e movement of prices was to 6ome extent
modified also by the news of the encouraging
condition of the distinguished sufferer this
morning. With the crisis. of tbe secondary ef

but the grangers. Pacifies, Southwestern^, coal

choicer grades of Hay. owing to light receipts.
This condition is only temporary, however, and
In due .to. the scarcity of cam and the strike.
When these two drawbacks are removrd it Is
expected that receipts will largely Increase

CHICAGO. Sept. 7.>-The leading speculative
markets ruled quiet and slightly lower to-day.
No material depression of prices due to the
President's condition was noticeable, the lower
price level balng due to causes chiefly local.
The usual disposition to do as little trading
as possible pending the Sunday holiday was
noticeable in the wheat pit. The opening was
easy. December opened Vic lower at 70V4O
70%c under the Influence of liberal Northwest
receipts and lower cables. Covering- by shorts
sent the price to 71c early, but -feeling was
beariph and telling for the Northwest account
Influenced liquidation fur the local account.
December declined to 70Vi@7UHo und closed
weak %c lower at "OVfcc.
Favorable weather conditions induced selling
of corn throughout the curtailed Saturday sen
6lon. Private crop reports were bullish, but
the liquidation was too forcerul to allow more
than a temporary show of firmness. Decem
ber closed V4c lower at S7Uc.
Oats were quiet, .prices declining with corn.
December closed %c down at 34Tfcc
There was a fair demand for provisions, led
by packers. The nelllng preKEure was- quite
heavy at one time In sympathy with hogs, but
the tide was HtemmctJ by local suptwrt and the
clote was fairly steady. Pork cloRÂ»d 2'.ic lower,
lard 2V4c hlchrr and ribs 5c down. , â¢ â¢

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS
?* .^ e hock t0 the monetary situation caused
b> the attempt, upon the life of President Mc-
Kinley. It may b<j observed, however, that
whatever monetary tension may incidentally
ft^n ? m the conse Quence of the attack upon
the President and from the surprising disclos
ures of conditions as regards reserve shown
by the bank statement will most likely ba
measurably relieved through imports of gold
from Europe, unless indeed the banks of Eng
land and France should seek either through an
advance on their official rates of discount or
by placing a high premium upon the metal to
prevent a movement of gold hither. Even in
that Improbable event, however, should our de
mands for relief become urgent, which condi
tion would be reflected In extremely high
rates for money at New York, this tension
would most likely be . sufficient to counteract
the efforts by the foreign banks to retard the
movement of gold hither and some of the metal
would undoubtedly be brought out Other
measures of relief to the situation, such as the
liquidation of loans and. If necessary, the issua
of Clearing-house certificates, which would
minimize the requirements for cash for the
Fettlement of Cleering-house balances, would
tend to restore confidence in case of any dis
turbance. Â¦.

In the famous cellars of the Hotel de

of wine which have been preserved for 250
years. A merchant figures out that if the
cost of maintaining the cellars, paymont
of rent, interest upon the original value
of the wine and other incidental charges
are considered, a bottle of this choice Ma
deira bas cost no less than $2,000,000, each
glassful $270,000, and a single drop could
not be sold .without loss, under 1200. It is
probable that this very old wine 13 worth

says It becomes "starved" after feeding

a week ago in search; of work. They
struck- up an acquaintance with Michaels,
to whom they told their names and trou

families.' Michaels found work for tho
men in an almond orchard and gave them
Â¦permission to sleep In his house.
"The men behaved" well. Michaels said,
until last night, when they suddenly set
upon him in- -his sleep. They bound his
hands and feet with ropes and then pro
ceeded to beat him until he was forced
to reveal the location of-the place where
he kept his money. The robbers found
$20. with which they made off. Michaels

Parsons Is a carpenter and had recently
been employed on the new Athenian Club
building at Franklin and Fourteenth
streets. He Is said to be related to the
ararchlst Parsons who was in -the .Hay
market riots at Chicago several years ago..
Immediately thereafter the committee
took testimony from the members who
had witnessed Parsons' act. A report
was made to the union that he had dis
honored the flag. A motion that he be
expelled from the union followed. Of 54
votes cast 50 were for Immediate expul
sion and two of the four negative voters
explained that they only voted as they did
because they thought there had been too
gieat haBte in the proceedings. They in
dorsed the committee's recommendation
so far as it was a punishment for the of
fense. ; - -
During the debate in the union a mem
ber exclaimed: "Nobody but an anarchist
would do such a thing as is here charged."
'â¢1 am an anarchist," interrupted Par
sons, "and I don't Â¦want any flag. "I won't
wear the flag of this country or any
other."
The act which led to this prompt and
dtastic move by the union occurred on
Labor --day, when Parsons ripped the
cicssed flags that are a part of the union's
bac'ge off the emblem and threw the In
signia on the ground. Several members
witnessed the act and favored immediate
action, but Â¦were restrained.
The matter was brought before the
union at its regular meeting Friday
night. A committee, composed of C. F.
Murdoch. John Shea, S. W. Getchell. J,
Foster and "William Griffiths, was appoint
ed to investigate. â¢
Because he tore the flag: of the United

ANARCHIST OUT
PBESIDENT NEARS A CRISIS.
From that moment a coolness sprung
up between Grand Secretary Long and
Grand Treasurer Dalton in the Modern
Trojans. Dalton tried to unseat Long-,
but the grand secretary haxl done much
of the organizing of the order and man
aged to hold the members and his place.
Since that time things have not gone
Â¦well in the order. The members became
Â«5ivl<Jed on political lines and some of
them began to drop out. The grand offi
cers have made an effort to rally them
but with little success. Efforts have been
made to get meetings of the grand offi
cers, but with indifferent success, and the
Indications are that the Modern Trojans
will find themselves wrecked upon the
rock of politics.
Members Divided Politically.
Things went well until last spring, when
tKe fight for control of the Republican
City Central Committee was in progress.
G-rand Secretary E. M. Long: of the Tro
jans was a member of the Republican
City Central Committee from the First
"Ward, placed there by Henry P. Dalton,
the grand treasurer of the order. The
Partlee-Dalton faction in politics had con
trol of the City Committee by a vote of
five to two. They lost the vote of T. TV.
LeBallister of the Seventh Ward, which
xnade the vote four to three in favor of
the Pardee-Dalton faction. Dalton
thought that Long would "stay pTit" po
litically and depended upon him to hold
the committee In line.
But suddenly Grand Secretary Long
clipped into the other camp and Pardee
and Dalton lost control of the City Com
mittee. Dalton accused Long of having
been bought, and the political excitement
that arose at that time is still remem
bered.
Order Grows Rapidly.
So the Supreme Lodge of Modern Tro
jans was organized, with S. G. Hilborn,
then Congressman from this district, as
jrraniJ president; E. M. Long as grand
secretary, Henry P. Dalton as grand
treasurer and F. K. Mott and B. A- Rabe
as grand directors.
The plan was a good one and organiza
tion of lodges went ahead quite rapidly
until there were ten in the field, all of
them located around the 'bay of San
Francisco. The high tide mark of mem
bers was about 1500.
When Congressman Hilborn died his
place was filled by J. W. Evans, at pres
ent School Director in Oakland.
The order of Modern. Trojans has
rtruck upon the rock of politics. It has
fallen before the opposing Greeks, and
Â¦while the directors and organizers are
making every effort to save it a suit has
been filed for an unpaid policy and there
Is a considerable disaffection among the
members. The suit was brought by Mrs.
Ann C Mitchell for a policy upon her
Jiusbend's life. She claims that he died
on March 24 of this year and that settle
ment has been refused.
But the Modern Trojans have proved
themselves unlike their ancient name-
Bakes. Internal dissension has rent them
In twain, and more of the troubles of the
order are due to local politics than to the
failure of the plan upon which they
Â¦worked. The ditferences between Grand
Secretary B. M. Long and Grand Treas
urer Henry P. Dalton, which differences
began â¢with local Oakland politics, have
â¢dampened the ardor of the members and
caused a partial paralysis of the organi
(*atlon. Some of the 'directors say they
liiave a good plan upon which to work,
,*nd they hope to be able to revive the or
â¢der by eliminating personality and put
ting it once more upon a firm basis.
" The Modern Trojans were organized in
.this city about five or six years ago. E.
JJ- Long, then a deputy assessor under
â¢Henry P- Dalton, was something of an
expert upon fraternal insurance. He had
rbeen connected with several societies and
Tcnew the systems upon which they all
â¢worked. Mr. Long advanced the idea of
.the Modern Trojans to his chief and out
lined a new plan that he said was better
than any in existence in the fraternal ln
eurance worlds He Bhowed how the or
ganization could be made to make money
by his plan. The principal feature of this
plan, different from other organizations
of dmUar object, was that when a death
claim matured and there was no money
â¢with which to meet it a certificate should
"be Issued by the order for the money
"bearing Interest and payable when money
should come Into the treasury- By this
means it was thought that the organiza
tion would never have to face bankruptcy
under any circumstances.

AIDS THIEVES
AND IS ROBBED
The child finally went to a friend of the
family. Mrs. Captain Lockyer, who lives
on Sixth street. Here It was noticed that
1 his throat was worse, and Dr. Gladding
i was summoned. He came Friday even-
Ing, and on examination pronounced the
case diphtheria. Strict orders were given
not to move the child to Its own home, as
the case was- deemed critical.
At this juncture Mrs. Ward returned
from the camp-meeting. She claims that
she found Mrs. Lockyer under the influ
ence of liquor and acting hysterically.
She was considered to be disturbing the
child, and Mr3. "Ward decided to disobey
the doctor and carry the boy on a mat
tress through the streets to his own
home. This was done, and Dr. Gladding
on his visit this morning found the child
dying. "While" working on the boy with
antitoxin death took place at 8:30 a, m.
Health Officer Rowell was notified and
placed both houses under quarantine. This
morning Mrs. Lockyer was found to be
breaking the quarantine and running
back and forth between the two houses.
-Marshal Kerns was notified and succeeded
in keeping hex^ in her house without ar
resting her. â¢â¢Â«"* Â¦ .
At first Dr. Gladding: refused to sign the
death certificate, and Deputy Coroner
Streightif made an investigation. Mrs.
Lockyer charged the boy's mother with
having deserted him to attend camp-meet
ing, while the mother accuses Mrs. Lock
yer Â¦ of Interfering in her family affair*
and of acting so as to make it impossible
for the boy to remain in her house. Mean
while both families are now under quar
antine. Dr. Gladding finally signed the
certificate. ...
The child Is the son of Mra. Matilda
Ward of Fifth street. West Berkeley. The
lad returned last Thursday from a visit to
Mill Valley and complained of a sore
throat. He was supposed to be suffering
from an attack of the mumps and was
treated for that complaint at first. His
mother had been attending the Spiritualist
camp-meeting. The neighbors charge that
she gave 'the boy little attention, claiming:
she would leave him in the morning and
not return until late at night.
â¢ BERKELEY, Sept. 7.â Ignoring the or
ders of the attending physician. - the
guardians of little Harry Ward moved the
boy last night from one house to another
when he was dangerously ill with diph
theria, and in a few hours the child was
dead. The circumstances of this strange
night transfer have caused Deputy Cor
oner Strelghtlf to investigate the case.
