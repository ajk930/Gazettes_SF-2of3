A revolution In a cup does not
*Â¦ Bound as big as a tempest In a tea
y Pot, yet eo started the two great
fforth American wars for Independence.
The Boston tea party had its counter
part Â«oi;th of the Rio Grande In the wine
party cf the Padre Hidalgo, Cura of the
Mission Dolores, between San Luis Potosl
end Guanajuato.
The Pafire Hidalgo Â«u fond of wine
and loved his quiet smile, for which he.
â¢who had forsworn the smiles of women,
might well be pardoned. Even this small
consolation for great losa was denied him,
for by the laws cf Spain It was forbidden
the people of Mexico to crush the grapes
Â¦when they were amber or when they were
purple; not that Spain would enforce tem
perance, but merely that ehe might sell
her own -wine Instead. Green grapes they
znight bruise for vinegar, but nobody
cared for rreen grapei anyway, any
where, any time or kind.
Law or no law. Padre Hidalgo, who' had
none of the smiles of women, would have
those^of the wine. But he had no money
to pay the jtax imposed upon the wine
brought from across the sea, and fore
seeing that cultivation of the vine would
yield much profit and pleasure he planted
a vineyard about the walls of the mission.
Of tbÂ« wine he made from It part was
i^aed for communion and a modest amount
' for his own table.
The Spanish Government was yien eag
erly looking for any method by which
It could put down the- church, and as
the time drew on to when the missions
of the Californlas were secularized every
possible means was taken to wrest from
the churches their email properties. In
the case of Hidalgo It was declared by
the Audiencia that hÂ« was planting the
vines and making- wine for the purpose
of Intoxicating the Indians and inciting
them to rebellion.
This unjust attack upon the vines which
Â¦were used for making the holy commun
ion wine angered the quiet prieBt beyond
restraint, and he flatly refused to obey
the command to destroy them.
The military was sent to enforce the
order and when" they left the vineyards
had been razed and burned, the wine press
destroyed and his wine confiscated.
That T.as the wine party of the Padre
Hidalgo.
This private wrong may account for the
etern, dogged, almost Saxon persistence
with which he began the contest. He
used the pulpit and confessional to pro
mote RiÂ» view*, and under the pretense of Â¦
a literary society patriotic meeting* werÂ«
held. ... , Â¦ -,
â¢The plan* of these patriots -were disco v- -
ered before they were ready to act, and
on the morning of the. 16th of September
(Sunday), in 1S10, the comrades came to
the house of Hidalgo and. told him that
their plot had been discovered.
The padre knew that they must act. at
once. Ringing the church bell earlier than
was his custom, he assembled his little
congregation to mass. But Instead of
prayers, he thus addressed them: "My
children, this day comes to us a new dis
pensation. Are you ready to receive it?
Will you be free? Will you make an ef
fort to recover from the hated Spaniards
the lands stolen from your forefathers?"
Then taking- the banner of Guadaloupe
from the sacred altar he sounded the
Grito de Dolores: "Viva nuestra Senpra
Guadaloupe! Viva la Independencia!" and
marched out of the church.
The whole congregation followed him
Into the street. He liberated the prisoners
who were In the city's prison and armed
them. The news of the enterprise spread
wide among the people, Who had only been
waiting for a leader. "Within twenty-four
hours the patriot priest was at the head
of an army large enough to enable him to
capture two cities with a united popula
tion of more than 30,000.
The mass of his army were Indians
armed with bows, arrows, slings, ma
chetes and lances. Arms of obsidian, thi
volcanic glass so often referred to by the
early historians of Mexico, which had lain
neglected since the days of.Cortez, were
now brought out and a stranger contrast
can scarcely be Imagined than that pre
sented by the Aztec levies and the beau-,
tiful regiment of the Queen and a. detach
ment of regulars which had Joined Hidal
go on his march.
Guanajuato was the objective point of
the campaign. It was the capital of the
province and the depot of the wealth of
the Spaniards. It is In the heart of the
richest mineral district.. The natives to
this day will tell you that after the hogs
have wallowed -in the pools the hose Is
turned, on them to wash the silver ? from
their bristles.
Rianon, the chief of the province, was
a great favorite in Mexico and a man
universally respected for his courage and
humanity. When he saw that all the In
dians and native-born Spanish-Americans
flocked to Hidalgo's banner he determined
not to defend the city, and shut himself
up with all the Europeans and the gold,
--silver and quicksilver in the Alhondega,
or granary. Here Rianon Intended <o de
fend his trust.
ThÂ«- Alhondega t Is still standing. " It Is
a two-story stone structure of immense
size, with walls from five to tea feet In
thickness. It .was originally Intended'; to
be used- as a granary in which ' to . store

â¢ never,- understood â¢* Hidalgo, decided to re
*treatl'-'..'* ,.".'. :.:â¢;'''/;Â¦.''.Â¦.Â¦â¢.'.Â¦Â¦ "
The City of Mexico was taken aghast
at^the capture of Guanajuato. The pres
tige-of tacit obedience had been broken!
The! depot of the mining. district had been
jacked! The whole country was In arms!
But the most valuable addition .he re
ceived was the person of Don Jose Marie
Morelos, also a priest. Oh" Morelos after
the death of. Hidalgo rested the mantle of
command. Some Idea of his enthusiasm
may be forme-1 from the fact that he set
out on the receipt of his commission ac
companied by. but five "badly armed ser
vants, with the' promise that within a
year he would take "Acapulco, a feat
which he absolutely accomplished and of
which Napoleon said: "It is one of the
great victories of. - the 'world. . sufficient
of itself to 'win for Morelos a place among
the immortals."
From there he went to "Valladolid and
entered without resistance. His army now
numbered 50,000, and In addition he was
reinforced by the militia of the province
and the dragoons of a neighboring city,
both of which were well equipped and In
good discipline.
Hidalgo did not remain long at Guana
juato, but' while there he established a
mint and a foundry for cannon, for which
he made use of bells found In the desert
ed houses of the rich.
Rianon fell dead as all was lost. Not a
Spaniard escaped. Hidalgo secured $5,000,-
KW In treasure.
This siege of the t Alhondega of Guanaju
ito was the Bunker Hill of Mexico.
At last an Indian placed a great flat
stone upon his back, and thus shielded
from the. bullets which the Spaniards
rained down upon it crawled up to the
gates and- burned them down. The army
followed up. this advantage, and after part
3f the garrison had perished from suffo
:atlon carried the castle.
Rianon replied that he declined to capit
ulate, and Hidalgo at once marched to the
attack. The Spaniards, about 2000 strong,
were well equipped and able to stand a
long siege. The patriots tried in vain to
carry the place, but the besieged were
constantly on the watch and gave them
no opportunity to approach the â¢ gates.
Torches were kept burning at n'.ght, and
by their : light the Spaniards shot every
man who came within reach.
Before the .insurgents made an attack
upon this fortress Hidalgo sent Abasola to
-Rianon with a letter announcing that ha
tad proclaimed : the independence of the
country and that as the only difficulty In
the way \va? the presence of -Europeans
it was necessary to banish the Spaniards
and "to. confiscate their property, which
' they had obtained by oppressive laws. He
promised protection to the Spaniards If
"they would submit and that their persons
should be conveyed to a place of safety.
surplus corn for public protection against
seasons of scarcity. Â¦ Â¦ - .
Several prominent men now joined thÂ»
ranks of Morelos. They were from tho
upper classes, and although sympathizers
with' the cause of independence . from. thÂ»
first they did not declare themselves' until
they Â¦ "saw \ a man â¢ appear . whom they
thought capable of ruling the storm. As
soon as' Morelos "became. 'known ' he was
recognized 'as the; man they sought.
. In January, of 1812 the royal forces, un
der * cilieja, , left the capital to- opposÂ»
Morelos, who was at Cuautla, about twen-
The whole of the year. 1811 was spent In
petty engagements, and by the great and
successful effort of Morelos to discipline
his army, the mass of whom werÂ»
nesroes.
The result of this battle was the posses
sion of eight hundred muskets and eight
pieces of artillery, . a large quantity ot
ammunition and money.
-The commandant marched out against
Morelos with a numerous body of troops,
but Morelos did not hesitate to attack
him with an Inferior force, and under
cover of night surprised and defeated the
royalists.
Morelos' first great exploit was the- cap
ture of Acapulco, already alluded to.
Acapulco was the great depot of the Ma
nila trade, probably the busiest town in
Mexico. The possession of it would put
an end to strife In that quarter.
He was a full-blooded Indian, who had
the elements of a great warrior In him.
He organized a Government, : convened
Congress, which Issued /â¢ a constitution,
and defeated the- Spaniards in several
battles. The history of his lifo from
the death of f Hidalgo to his own Is
the history of the revolution.
"With the heads of the leaders cut off
many thought that "the- revolution was
forever at an end. There . was at this
time one man only who stood forth con
spicuous among the revolutionists as aa
admitted chiefâ Morelos.
Their heads were cut off and taken to
Guanajuato, where they were placed on
four hooks projecting from the corners
of the Alhondega. And there they re
mained until 1823, when the Â¦ successful
revolutionists took them down and burled
them with the honors due the memory of
the first martyrs of Mexican liberty.
On the road they were surprised and
captured by a former partisan, who could
not resist the temptation of . so valuable
a capture. They were taken to Chihua
hua, tried, degraded and shot. ,,
After "a terrific battle at Guadalajara,
In which the Mexican troops were com
pelled to retreat, there were but four
thousand soldiers left. It was decided to
leave them under command of â¢ Rayon,

THE STORY OF
MEXICO'S
INDEPENDENCETHE old. old Spanish highway Is ta
be reconstructed. Already, a con
certed effort 13 being made to re
build the ancient road traveled by
the pious Franciscans in the days
before the gringos cameâ more than a
century ago.
The Boards of Supervisors In all of the
counties of California In which missions,
pueblos and presidios originally estab
lished are located will be aopealed to to
further tht movement. Many of these
bodies have already acceded to the re
quests cf the association that is seeking
to have re-established the old, original
highway connecting the twenty-one mis
sions from north to south.
1 have personally visited all but three
of the missions, I believe, and have trav
ersed a goodly portion of the original road
at various times, which was used by the
Franciscans nuil their followers and
whose surface, as it remains to-day, was
largely rounded and smoothed by the
rawhide sandals upon their feet.
"El Camino Real," the royal road, or
less literally, the king's highway, was not
made nor )aid out by survey. The Fran
ciscans selected the most direct route
practicable between their pueblos and
missions, and if portions of it were
crooked and curved it was because there
were heavy grades or hills to be encoun
tered too severe for the strength of their
horees or cattle. San Diego County, the
southernmost in the State, contained the
first of the presidios, of which there were
four in California. Of the other three one
is located at Santa Barbara, one at Mon
terey and one at San Franc. so. Tr.e.e
were also garrisons at three pueblos and
at each of the twenty- one missions, and
this road as originally used was a military
highway for the tiansportation of troops
and supplies.
The pueblos of Los Angeles. Branc'forte
(Santa Ctuz) and San Jcse were a 3O on
this original road, and before the advent
of the railroad it was used from San
Diego to the mission cf San Francisco
Solano and was kept in perfect repair. Â¦
But let us follow the old. road, imagining
It to etill be passable all the way. ar.d
note some of the interesting scenes that
will be available to the tourist as soon, as .
the oM. road shall have been rehabilitated.
The mission of San Ditgo was founded
in 17P9. The present city of the same
name was not dreamed of until a century
later, but there remain in the present
"Old Town," as the tiire-tcbles give it. a
host of interesting ruins of the former
people, and among them the o^ mission,
still In a fair ttate of preservation.

the steam roads, with its wealth of rem
in'scen'.e, its inexhaustible fund of inter
esting history engrossed indelibly upon
the pages of its ancient ledgers, is a mis
sion well worth more than a passing

The road originally used to cross -the

but ill-defined in. some places at this day.
Mining and oil prospectors have mado

I'ne mission at Ventura, known still by
its original name, San Buena Ventura, Is
on the main street of the town and marks
again the line of the royal road. Its main
building is well preserved, having been
partially reconstructed. The original .til

The Santa Clara Mission is one of toe

mable value. The average distance, it will
have been noted. Irom ore mission to an
other has been about thirty miles. In tha
Journey from San Jo^e north, however,
there was no suitab'e site found until San,
Francisco was reached, distant by orig
inal road thirty-nine miles. Here the Mis
sion Dolores was established, and to-day
it presents one of the most remarkable
examples of the architecture of the Fran
ciscans.
The royal road U still open and used
all the way to this mission from San Jose,
passing through Palo Alto. San Mateo.
Millbrae and almost all of the present
towns on the line of tbe Southern Pacific.
From the present mission site to tha
present presidio, a portion of which was
included in the original Franciscan pre
sidio, the road has been converted into
city streets, but old maps show it plainly
and it is all open and in good condition.
Thence it is open to San Rafael mission
and passes in front of that structure,
which was the only mission in Marin
County. Thence it turns toward the mis
sion of San Francisco Solano, which was
the twenty-first and last of the chain es
tablished by the Franciscans.

Northwest from Monterey- the highway
passes through â¢ what is 1 now -the main
business street of Salinas to the mission
of San Juan, Bautista; thirty-one miles,
and is still open and in good condition all
the way. Thence it wound northeasterly
throush the hills in the vicinity of Pajaro
and Watsonvllle to Santa Cruz, which
was. the second pueblo In the original
scheme. The mission of Branc ! forte was
established here and is still known by
that name to the Spanish settlers, al
though the name Santa Cruz is most gen
irally applied to it.
Crossing the Santa Cruz Mountains to-
minus. 500 or more miles to "the north.
From this point northeastward, distant a
little more than thirty miles, the original
road takes its way through beautiful
mountain canyons to the mission of San
Luis Rey. The mission is in ruins except
the chapel, which has been partly recon
structed within the present decade and
which is ndw rated as one of the best
examples of mission architecture to bo
seen anywhere in the State.
The ruined portion presents a compre
hensive idea of the immensity of the work
done by the Franciscans, for some of tha
old walls still standing and the long tiers
of ruined archways are massive In size.
El Camino Real passes directly in front of
this mission and is to-dav an excellent
roadway.
From San Luis Rev mission the orig
inal road continues toward the mission of
San Juan Capistrano, crossing the Una
into the present Orange County in the
San Onofro Canyon, about three and a
half miles from the coast. It passes di
rectly through the town of Fallbrook and
for the greater jjart of the distance from
San Luis Rey to San Juan is to-day tha
best read in use.
The mission of San Juan Caplstrano is
in a more ruined condition, perhaps, than
almost any of the other missions. About
the middle of the last century it was
â¢wrecked by an earthquake and many per
sons lost their lives. The smaller chapel
has been kept in a fair state of preserva
tion, however, and some of the relics of
former greatness may be^ seen within its
rooms. There is a baptismal font here of
rarest workmanship, being carved most
beautifully from a solid block of flint
like granite. Some of the original paint
ings and statuary used in this mission are
preserved in the present chapel and are
eaid to be among the finest specimens of
early Spanish art brought to this country.
The large chapel, which was construct
ed many years after the founding of the
mission, is totally demolished, however,
and only the rear wall stands. The
cathedral beils at this mission. I am as
sured, occupy the same p'ace to-day in
the open belfry that they did when placed
there originally, more than a century a?o.
There are also some of the first official
documents indited by the hand of Father
Junipero Serra to be seen here. El
Camlno Real passes along- the lower side
of what was originally the east wall of
the mission and is the main road from
Capistrano to Santa Ana to-day.
From Santa Ana the original road,
which Is now Main street in that place,
continued northward to a point on thÂ»
Santa Ana River, about four miles from
the present town of Anaheim. Only three
or four years ago this was abandoned by
the County Supervisors for a new route,
because of the fact that the road paral
leled the Southern Pacific tracks in dan
gerous proximity for a distance of several
miles. Irom Anaheim, through Fuller
tons main street to Whlttier and thence
to Los Angeles the road is still in good
condition and in daily use.
At Los Angeles the first of the old pueb
los was established. There were two mis
sions In what is now I^os Angeles Countv ;
the first. San Gabriel, about eighteen
miles toward the north, was uÂ«ed as a
center of supplies for the southern mis
sions. It is fairly well preserved to-day
and its main chapel, with heavy but
tressed walls of baked adobe slabs "is im
pervious to the ra vases of time. A mod
ern roof of shingle?, however, mars the
beauty of its original effect. The second
mission In Los Angeles Countv was San
Fernando, distant twenty-eight miles a
little west of north from San Gabriel.
One of the finest preserved ancient "tile
roofs to be seen on any of the missions
Is here and the fountains in the patio are
of immense size and unus-ml construction
The long corridors of archway- pecu

approaching the mission from the south
he will see. covering several miles of the
journey, magnificent proves of live oak

There was a gypsy smack once that fell

to keep one" barrel in reserve. I had an
opportunity of asking him if this wero
true. I cannot recollect what he said
about having performed this feat more
than once, but he told how he just missed
getting a sixth elephant out of a herd
through a mistake. He got up to a herd
in a jungle and commenced operations on
a tusker that 'was standing by a clump
of bamboo. ; The smoke 'Â¦â hung and he
could not see what happened, but on ,the
other side- of the- clump of bamboo he
saw a tusker, which he presumed was the
one he had just fired at, so promptly
dropped it. He had- got three more out
of. the herd, and was reduced to his last
barrel, when another elephant, a tusker,
Y think, gave him a very easy .chance,
which he could hardly have missed, but
he would; not break his rule,, so- let him
go. On returning to the clump of bam
boos he found two tuskers dead, making
five elephants in all. and regretted he had
not broken his rule for once. Think of
"three brace" of elephants for a day's
bag! < - â¢ .

as well it might. He got among a herd
of in very long grass, and 1 , for
some time couJd not set a shot. ; At last
he got up to one, and, dropping it dead,
jumped on the body, and with a second
gun dropped two more' eleDhants before
they had time to malce off. I had heard
.it said of Michael that he was in the habit
of going out with three double-barreled
guns, and had frequently got five ele-

because he considers it showed thorough
knowledge of the game. One day he was
was out botanizing with a friend, and was
unarmed. They heard elephants in a
sholah below and Michael sent back for
his rifles. 'On getting down into the sho
lah Michael found his quarry wa3 two
tuskers, evidently traveling cne behind
tha other. He intercepted them and had
covered the leauer and was just going
to tire when it flashed through his brain
that the second wcnM escape him â greedy
man! He accordingly dropped the hind
most elephant first, and, as he antici
pated, the leader wheeled around, got
blocked by. his prostrate companion, and
gave Michael time to lay him out beside
himâ the tv.o. tell with their tusks to
gether. Ger.eV?.! Michael shot the major
ity of his hundred odil elephants with a
1-f-bore, which in the days of muszle-load
ers was the ordinary sun, just as a 12
bore is now.
The maximum charge in the gauge of
his powder flask was five drains, but when
he was loading for elephants he used to
add a little more. Compare this with the
metal'and charges used for big game now!
His success in this particular form, of
sport was due quite as much to a perfect
knowledge of the game as to splendid
shooting. His directions for finding tha
way to the brain of an elephant were as
follows:
"Imagine a ramrod (there were ram
rods in those -days) passed from earhol*
to earhole through the elephant's head,
and another bisecting it vertically; in
whatever position you may be. aim for
thiÂ« point of bisection." I have heard It
said of Michael that he used to so con
centrate his thought on this one imagin
ary point that he. in a sort of way, lost
sight of everything else. I presume that
it goes without saying that if yot Und,
yourself in such a position that your gun
cannot penetrate to the desired point you
must not fire at all. - In the old days wild
elephants were looked upon as something;
to be got rid of, and Government gave re
wards for shooting themâ I think it was
60 rupees for a cow and 90 rupees- for a
tusker â and the tusks were the property
of the shooter. â London Globe.

question! Is it to be a reception, theater

-For evening wear .the- soft -puffs are
pretty and not. too fuzzy.' The hair is di
vided into aboift seven parts and each one
is rolled' into a puftV and held in place by
an invisible hairpin. When two curls are
cunningly added,, the entire effect is well
worth the time and trouble expended. But \
that is, only the back, and one generally
cares more -about facing their 'friends
than continually turning the cold shoul

The front may ' be dressed tea variety
of ways. Quite, the smartest is the side

be a very popular one.
Then there Â¦ is the new old fashion of
parting the hair in the middle. It is slow
ly, feeling Its way back into life again.
Â¦Not exactly, like "it used to look, but near
enough to recognize it r witliout an intro

many people can wear it that way suc
cessfully; and success- is what every wo
man is looking for these days,

place with hairpins that fail to make any
impression. The latest fancy seems to be
to use wire pins, not bpcause they ara
more comfortable but because they are
not half as conspicuous. Either one ex
treme or the otherâ pins that can be seen
half a block away or those that cannot
be found with a microscope.
The figure' "8" is perhaps the simplest
and easiest to do of all, and consequently
the most demand. There is nothing to
it but to place the coll in an eight and
fasten it down well. Anybody can do It
if she only has the necessary hair.
This revision was sure to come sooner
or later and it has come later, much to
the annoyance' of everybody who has to
follow suit. The new hats are to blame
for it all, but nobody will say a word
when. they see how swagger they are and
how universally becoming.

Laird & Lee of Chicago have just issued
in dainty form "El Centlloquio," by San
tillana, the illustrious Spanish poet of the
early fifteenth century. The original text
has been reproduced In Spanish with only,
such changes as would make it easy read
ing for even a very inexperienced student
of the Castilian ! language. Notes and a
vocabulary complete all that concerns this
poem of one hundred stanzas. The "Cen
tiloquio," like Fenelon'c "Adventures of
Telemachus." was especially written as
a book of lofty, precepts for the education
of a royal prince; and in the richness of
its examples, th<* beauty of its moral ex
hortations, the grace of its comparisons,
it excels the effort of the teacher of King
Louis XIV's grandson/ , A cleverly com
piled collection of Spanish proverbs with
Englisn translations complete:* the vol
| ume. Copies, printed on special paper,
â¢'larger -size, were presented to the Queen
JRegent of SpalfH President McKinley and
"President Diaz (a special edition of three
copies only). "accompanied by appropriate
letters from editors and publishers.

El Cantiloquio.
This father of Foma is a man "without
conscience, keen in business, a hard mas
ter, a hard drinker, a brute. He craves
a son that his vast possessions and name
may be perpetuated. By a second mar-,
riage Foma is born to his wife and Ignat
is delighted. The mother, a strange crea
ture of preoccupied mein. taciturn, and.
as Igr.at calls her. "a fantastic dreamer,"
dies at the birth of her son.
Ignat lavishes all his affection on his
son. It is the se'.fish affection of the per
petuation of self.
For a time Foma lives with the family
of his godfather, but at last comes home
to be under the care of his aunt. To him
his father is ever incomprehensible. He
cannot understand the great practical .
man of business who drinks and swears.
He likes him better drunk than sober,
for then he receives more of the animal
love of the brute parent and sees less of
the disagreeable merchant. His aunt de
lights him, for she appeals to the ideal
side of his nature -with her stories of
giants and robbers and princesses. Foma
has much of the sad-eyed mother in him.
He yearns for what he knows not, and Is
made happy with a promise from his
tiaddy that he shall go on a. trip on the
Volga.
To Foma'fi surprise, as far as he travels
everything seems the same. He meets
with none of the people of fairyland, but
in all the cities he rinds the first the same
as the last. He is ever seeking, but finds
not. His after life is very much like that
of the owl he chases in the ravine during
his school days.
"And in the ravine we scared up an
owl," related the boy. "What fun it
was! The owl flew out and went whack:
against a tree. It evep squealed until It
was really pitiful. But we scared him
again, and he rose again, and it was the
same thing ' all over â he flew and flew,
and then went bang into something
* * * so that his feathers were strewn
all around! He hovered and hovered over
the ravine, and he managed to hide him
eelf somewhere, and we didn't try to find
him any more, we felt so sorry for himâ
he was all bruisedâ"
That is Foma's own life story told alle
gorically. He has no chance from the
start, for his life goes simply from bad
to worse. Ke feels and knows that there
is something wrong, but what it is ho
doesn't know. He despises the merchant
class and recognizes the evils in the
â¢world, yet he can suggest no remedy.
Before his father dies Foma is eent
away on a trip by himself in charge or
the boat. He is totally unfit for a busi
ness career. He tries to make friends of
the peasants, yet creates only enemies.
As he is rich and handsome he naturallv
falls an easy prey to the wiles of femin
inity and on this first trip alone in the
world he has an affair that appeals to
him seriouslyâ so seriously that even his
first amour is touched by the queer guile
leEsness of the youth and instead of fleec
ing him turns to giving him good advice.
His next love is equally serious for
Foma. but just as badly misplaced. Still
here again the woman has mercy on him
and tries to appeal to his better side. He
ie naturally inclined to believe the best of
people and almost kills an official at the
club who makes disparaging remarks
about the character of this woman who
has juet been unkind and yet kind to him.
After the affair at the club he seeks re
lief from the mental problems that ha
rass him in drink and the society of dis
t*>lute people. . â¢ ; _.'
His father and aunt are both dead. He
despises his godfather, another of the
merchant class, and refuses to be guided
by his counsels of "make money." After
a frightful debauch, in, which he sinks a
barge and nearly loses the lives of many
people, he tries . to get this , godfather to
take all his money and estates and let
him be free to go Into the world alone
and unknown. The old man. will not con
sent to this, but says- that If Foma keeps
on in the way he is going and | does not
reform he will have him put in an insane
asylum. This enrages the young Russian
to such an extent that be defies the old
man and but throws himself and hlÂ»
money away the faster.
The climax comes when Foma is one of
Foma Gordyeeff Is the son of a rich
jnerchant, a man who has made his
money from his steamboats and by trad
ing on the Volga. Ignat. the father, is a
type of the rich merchant class of Rus
sia, according to the pen of Gorky.
Gorky has no love for the merchants, as
his bcok bears testimony, and he paints
Ignat in strong colors.
His work is great because It is so dead
ly serious; because it is a strange combi
nation of idealism, realism and poetry,
and because it is the cry, from the heart
of a men who has lived long and hard in
few years. There is not a lovable char
acter in the whole book. His women,
Â¦with two exceptions, are unmentionable.
Gorky's life is given on another part
of this page and is in itself a key to his
â¢writings.
"Foma Gordyeeff" is his first long
work. Gorkj' has already made a. name
for himself by his short stories of Rus
sian life and is now looked upon as a
coming writer of the Russias â one who
â¢will rank with Tolstoi and Turgenleff.
Â»j=^,EADIXG "Foma Gordyeeff" is
|L_j/ slightly suggestive of a trip
j^^ through the morgue, but even like
a visit of that kind it has its fasci
nations. Maxim Gorky, the author, tried
to commit suicide at one time In his
eventful careerâ possibly this accounts
for his extreme pessimism.
A new periodical" is being, published.by

"Taflm 1 ." they said in a low tone on deck.
"Tafimka!" â¢ ....-â¢ __.â¢.,Â¦._._.Â¦
"We-ell!" â¢ . â¢ â¢
"The devil! Get up! Take the boathook!" j
"O-o-o-o," groaned the sound close at hand,
and Foma, with Â¦ a shudder, staggered away
from the window. Â¦/ .
The strange sound floated nearer and nearer.
and increased In strength, sobbing and melting
away in the dense darkness. And on deck they
whispered anxiously:
"Tafimka! Do get up! A visitor Is coming!"
"Where?" rang out the hurried question â
then bare feet shuffled across the deck, a
bustle became audible, and past the boy' s face
two boathooks glided from above and almost
noiselessly plunged Into the thick water. Â¦_
"A vl-i-si-tor!" came a moaning cry near at
hand, and then came a feoft but very strange
splashing of water.
The boy quivered with terror at this mourn-.'
ful cry. but could not tear his hands from the T
window and his eyes from the water.
"Light the lanternâ we can't see at all."
"Immediately."
Then a spot of troubled light fell upon the
water. Foma caw that the water was surging
gently and a ripple was running over -it. as
though it were in pain and were quivering with
ansrulsh.
"Look â look!" the men on the deck whispered .
in terror..
At that moment In the circle of light upon
the water there appeared a huge, dreadful face,'
with grinning white teeth. It floated and
rocked on the water. Its teeth were aimed
straight at Foma and seemed to be saying to
him, with a smile:
"Eh, my lad. my lad. 'tis co-old â farewell!"
The boathooks trembled, rose in the air and
then descended into the water and began cau- ]
tiously to push into something.
"Guide Itâ guide it â look out â it will get into
the paddle-wheel."
"Give it a shove yourself."
The boathooks slid along the bulwark and
caught hold of the thing simultaneously, with
a sound like the gnashing of teeth. Foma could
not close his eyes as he stared at them. ' The
clatter of feet as they tramped along the deck,
overhead, gradually withdrew to the bow. And .
then again rang out that moaning sound, like
a funeral dirge: /_
-â¢"A vl-i-igitor'."
"Daddy 1 ." shrieked Foma in a ringing voice.
"Daddy!"
His father sprang to his feet and ran to him.
"What is it? What are* they doing out
there?" screamed Foma.
Ignat. with vast strides, rushed out of the
cabin, yelling Favagel}'. He soon returned, be
fore Foma. tottering and gazing around him in
terror, had got from the window to his fath
er's bed.
"They have frightened you â -well, never
mind!" cald Ignat. taking him by the h.-yvi.
"Get into bed with me."
"What is it?" asked Foma, softly.
"Nothing, my son. It was a drowned man.
A man has been drowned and was floating â
it was nothing. Don't you be afraid; he has
already floated away." i
"Why did they shove him?" the boy per
sisted In his questions, pressing close to his
father, and covering his eyes to keep out the
terror.
"Whyâ because it had to be done. The water
would drive him Into the paddlewheelâ our
â¢wheel, for example â and to-morrow the police
would spy it out â and there would be a row
and questions, and they would detain us here.
So they helped him to Journey farther. What
difference do*s it make to him? He's al
ready dead â It doesn't injure him, it doesn't
hurt his feelingsâ but he would have made
trouble for the live people. Go to sleep, my
son."
"And so he is floating away?"
"Yes. he is floating awayâ they'll fish him
out somewhere, and bury him."
"And. won't the fishes eat him?"
"Fishes don't eat human flesh â crabs do.
They are fond of It."
Foma' s terror melted away at the contact
of his father's warm body, but the dreadful
face with the grinning teeth still rocked on
the water- before his vision. !
; "And. who was he?"
"God knows. Tell God about him; say. 'Oh.
Lord, give rest to his 3oul.' "
"Oh, Lord, give rest to his eoul." repeated
Foma In a whisper.
"There, nowâ go to sleep; have no fears. He
is far away already. He is floating alongâ
and, see here: be careful not to go too close
to the Bide of the boat â you might -fall 'â¢Â¦
which God forbidâ Into the water â "
"And did he fall overboard?" ' \. ''.'.*';..Â¦;';â¢'
"Of courseâ perhaps he was drunkâ and that
was the end of him! Perhaps he threw himself
in. There are men who â a man takes and
throws himself into the watÂ»r and is drowned.
Life 1Â« so arranged, my dear boy. that death
in sometimes a festival for a man; and for
all It 1h a blessing."
"Daddy ... . "

The long-drawn cry rang out from afar and
ended In a sort of moan. Now some one walked
across the deck to the side of the steamer.

maintained there will be very few readers
and students who" will feel that they /can
afford to be without it. Its scope is world

valuable is the concise biographies of liv

characters of our own land and other
countries. Each monthly â¢ issue will also
contain obituaries of eminent men and
women recently deceased. It is to be is
sued about the 15th of every month and
will contain all information up. to the 1st.

' ! The Corsair King.- v v
In "The Corsair King," by Maurus
Jokal, you will find a pirate story of the
real old blood and thunder sortâsome
thing on every. page to make your. blood
curdle. \ The Corsair King is a young man
who leaves his promised bride and family
to seek his fortunes on the high seas." His
ship is taken by pirates and he himself is
made a captive, but refuses to join the
rdhber band. * -
Finally, in one of their many fights, he
sees a fine man-of-war fly from their ship
when it is superior to the pirate craft in
both men and guns. He had hoped to be
rescued by this vessel, and so upon, its
retreat he curses her men for cowards and
forthwith joins the band of sea robbers.
In time he is made the captain of the
pirate ship and his name is more feared
on the seas than that of any other. At
one time he returns to visit his family for
a period of hours and renews his vows
with his beloved, but of course drops no
hint of his vocation. ,
This love of the Corsair King is the one
thread of gold that weaves in its purity
through a tale of grim murders and black
horrors. Whether the pirate reforms In
time to marry the maid of his choice or
dies fighting under the black flag is for
Maurus Jokal to tell the reader.
The story shows all the characteristic
strength of Jokai's pen and is rather a
departure in choice of scene from his
usual writing. It Is a good book for
train reading when you have an hqur or
two journey ahead of you with no better
company than yourself. (Published by L.

Mr. Lang's little volume. "Letters to
Dead Authors,*' is, in. a way. the finest
collection of prose- parodies we posses:*.
For here, in these various letters,;, to
Rabelais, to Herodotus,, to Lucian, to
Theocritus, to Djckens, to Thackeray, to
Austen, to Dumas and various others, we
have what seems the highest point any
English writer has yet reached in the art
of subtly parodying the essence of a style.
Mr. Lang's prefatory admission of the
parodic nature of his book is in the vein
of apology; he avers that "It Is, perhaps,
superfluous to add that some of the Jet-,
ters are written rather to suit the corre
spondent than to express the writer's own
taste of opinions." Which is a neat and
modest manner of phrasing one of the
cardinal laws of parody. Mr. Lang, of
course, while ever memorable for ths
scholarly skill he has brought to the art
of parody, Is too much concerned with,
the classical to serve as aught save ,a
somewhat lofty standard for the militant
parodist of this young century. There is
little of the militant In "Letters to Dead
Authors." To be sure, there â¢was the epis-^
tie to Lord Byron. So true a note of'
properly militant parody i3 struck here ..

prepared a supplementary chapter deal

lished since the biography was written in
1S8S. The book thus contains a critical and
descriptive account of the entire literary
work of Ibsen, and constitutes the. only
authoritative treatment of the subject in
the English language. Since Ibsen's pro
ductive activity is now probably at an
end. the biography in Its present form
may be considered definitive, and should
find a place in every collection of the
standard works of modern literature.

him of- his first pair and the/boyhood days
associated with them.".
Contrary to the usual custom this In
dian refused to take any stimulant, and
by special request was allowed to die and
be buried with his boots on. What was
his strange idea in. this no one ever knew,
but his last. gaze as Lunt dropped the
noose over, his head was down at his
precious boots, and as the black cap
slipped over his face they were the last
sight of his life.
â¢'Warden Hale executed the decree of. the
court expeditiously. with much tact and
in a'most formal manner." \
It made the work of the tyros simple
and expeditious, so much so that the
comments, as reported .in a paper of the
day, were: "A- perfect hanging." "A
very neat job."- VA. splendid hanging."
His first experience was, : fortunately
for him. an easy one. The hangee was an
American. Very much, indeed an Ameri

Sullivan wanted to die gamely. He made
a little speech before he : died. Not ; to
defend himself, but to say to others:
- "Leave women, wine j and . song alone.
That is why I. am here." He then asked
â¢the, privilege of being allowed to place the
noose over his own head, but it was
whisperingly explained, to him" by Lunt
-. that his arms would ' have /to be strapped.
"Don't draw them so tight, then,"/ he.

Azoff, < as the black cap and the tighten

giant in strength and the drop," although
more than usual, did not kill him. For
thirteen: minutes he fought and struggled
on the end of the rope like &. trout on a
line and nearly burst loose the heavy har
ness strap which bound his arms.
Azoff | and Collins had both heard the
drop and m fact every little sound con
nected with Garcia's "hanging, and Lunt
was much pained whenever the least
audible noise was made. It seemed to
cut him like a knife, and he was fierce In
his commands to those 'Â¦ who were guilty
of the least negligence, for there was
nothing^ but a board partition between
the two rooms and he knew what suffer
ing it inflicted upon the remaining pris
oners, for. he realized that even the dull
est and most insensible of men become
keenly conscious in that supreme moment
of ;. their lives which precedes the 'close.
' No sooner was he In his coffin and Idly
staring at those on whom he had smiled
but ten minutes before than a new rope
was brought from the stretching room,
tied In its place, tested by tire dropping
weight and all was ready for the next. Â¦
It seemed like a long day's work to
hang three men, and lest something might
happen, a trap break or unexpected
troubles occur, an early start was made.
At 6:25 the procession came out of the
door, leading from the death chamber.
Two priests chanted the service for the

nodded and smiled at the two prisoners

Hay. Even with all this, one of the pris
oners managed to get his head under the
blankets, tie a shoestring around his neck
and nearly choke himself to death. Azoff
Â¦ was more carefully searched,, and it was
found that he had broken open one of his
shoes from the inside, taken out. the little
steel spring which supports the instep,
sharpened it Hke a razor and would have
very successfully performed his own ex
ecution. His shoes were taken from him
and - he marched to the gallows in slip

\ June 7. 1S55, was a trying day for Lunt.
There -were three Â¦ executions*, set for It..
Three men to hang!
Â¦Fortunately, they .were not the kind of
men about whom he need be squeamish.
Kmilc ' Garcia 2 had â¢ cut a Frenchman's
throat in. San Bernardino. A. Azoff had
killed Len Harris. P. J. Collins had mur
dered his Janitor wife to get drink money.
There were six men on the death watch
over these prisoners, for It was' known
that Azoff had been boasting that he
would cheat the gallows. ' -
The death chambers in which they were
confined were wooden cages in the middle
of- an open room. Nothing in them but
mattresses on the floor and. bedding on
that. A bright gas jet burned high near
thecelling. Outside two locomotive head
lights cast their powerful rays into the
cells, s'o that they were brighter than.
After the stretching rooms comes the
one In whic^i the gallows is erected. A
platform perhaps twelve feet square, but
little more than the height of a man's
head from the floor, toward the front of
the platform, two traps, side by â¢ sid*.
Above them the stout beam from which
two nooses are dangling. In the noose is
a round cylinder of wood, three or four
inches in diameter. "Just the size that
a man's neck reduces to when hanged,"
explains the assistant hangman.
It looks painfully, very painfully small,
and makes one wiggle the head a bit

drops It stays. It does not spring up and

very still, which is much easier on. the
nerves of the spectators.
dred pounds of brick. This heavy weight
is kept stretching the rope until it is
wanted at the scaffold.
There are at present, as at all times,
three ropes thus being stretched at San
Quentin.
As soon as one is used another is put on
the stretcher.
So sure Is the hangman of his game.
Beware! men who* are planning crimes.
The ropes are stretching in hangman's
hall.
The assistant hangmen rub and pat
those ropes, while they are stretching and
hardening. Just as a hunter pats (the bar
rel of his tun.
The test of a rope when it Is ready for
hanging a man is that it must have no
more stretch In it. It must be "dead," as
Lunt used to call it. Then the stretch Is
made fast and the other has a box at
tached to it which is filled with three hun-
through pulleys in the ceiling. One end is
pany. While corporations have no souls,
it seems that they have superstitions and
for that reason the rope works, while will
ing to make the rope, steadily refuses to
take any pay, believing that a "hoodoo"
would attach to money which had the
taint of blood upon it.
The rope is about three-quarters of an

It -was a curious combination of cir
cumstances that turned a mild-mannered
Massachusetts boy int.. official hangman
of a wild Western State. All his life he
had boen a clerk or bookkeeper, unused
to manual labor: health failing from con

to refrain from all active work and take.
plenty of exercise in the open air. The
position of policeman just filling these re
quirements he exerted sufficient political
influence to secure himself that occupa
tion in Santa Cruz. The place threatened
io fail there, and in return for more pj
} Htical services he was appointed as a
guard at San Quentin. .
Hale was then Warden, having Just
taken his position. It was his nemesis,
a sword of his forging swung above h'is
head by forces over which he had no con
trol.
Hale hated hanging.
He would not willingly kill a chicken for
his own breakfast.
He had for years been Sheriff of Ala
meda County and liked everything about
the office except the hanging duties which
It entailed. He had a powerful clique of
friends, won by his urbane manners.
He used his influence to relieve himself
of the duties of hanging by 'having a bill
passed through the Legislature which
provided for ail hanging to be done at
San Quentin.
Kale was happily rid of hangings.
Then came one of those revolutions
â¢which upset things political. One night
on the eve of election some very young
men took it into their heads to run things
and they did. The next day Hale had
been defeated at the primaries in his can
didacy for the office of Sheriff, but later
on the place of Warden was offered him.
He took it and assumed ten times, a hun
dred times, the amount of the horrible
burden of hanging that he had endeavored
to escape.
Amos Lunt was the senior guard at the
-A prison. He sat in his lenely tower above
and in front of the main gate all day long
taking signals as prisoners came and
went. *As most responsible man theie
and one who was by his mild and quiet
manners best qualified to carry out War
den Hale's ideas of treating men kindly,"
he was selected to place the nooses over
the necks of the condemned.
The actual springing of the trap is done
by other guards. "Th<? Invisible Three,"
Â¦who, concealed from view, and- unknown
to all. cut the cords, one of which is
fatal. This duty, the actual hanging.
Lunt always sturdily refused.
He was willing to place the noose about
â¢ the prisoner's neck, but for all that he
wouJd go the noose and man might stay
as they were till doomsday, so he ex
pressed it; he would never spring the
trap.
In order that the method of scattering
and concealing responsibility may be un
derstood, it will be necessary to explain
the workings of the death machine. The
gallows at San Quentin is on the fourth
floor of a large brick building and occu
pies, -with its various ante-chambers and
death cells, the entire space, which is
known as "hangman's hall."
Entering the building from an exterior
Cight of stairs, the' first- room Is the
stretching room, where tHe specially
made roue is cut in proper lengths and
stretched for month after month until
there is no morfe stretch or twist in it.
Much depends upon the ropa. Amos
Lunt's choice was for a special twist,
, made to order by the Tubbs Cordage Com-
long which was taken from the "necks of
one of the hanged men above referred to,
and those bits of rope will soon take an
other vaiuejn the eyes of their possessors,
for . Lunt â¢ himself will soon have . passed
away. .
The hanging of William Young on Oc
tober 25, 1S95, closed what had been tha
busiest season that i the prison had ever :
seen. Young was the weakest nerved of
all. His head rolled and his knees stag
gered as he tried to go to his fate.
After all these, the banging of Chum
Sing, a highbinder from up in the Sierras,
was an easy matter, for he was sullen
and morose, and seemed unconcerned,
about his fate. F. C. Klosa, too, waa
easy, for he had killed a sleeping friend
while under the influence of liquor.
Harvey Allender of San Jose had mur
dered his sweetheart because he saw her
with another man, and had killed tha
other man, too. He tried to die game,
but he was Lunt's thirteenth man, and
it seemed a strain for both. of them.'
Durrant's execution was an event. Spe
cial wires had been run to the prison, so
that if a reprieve came there might be no
delay in getting it there on time." Men
were stretched, along the road to guard
the wires 'lest they be cut or tampered
with. Durrant had been reprieved again
and again, and another might come. '
Lunt was the last man In the funeral
procession when Durrant entered the exe
cution chamber. On the scaffold, just as
the noose was being slipped over his head,.
Durrant gave a look at the executioner,
which. Lunt interpreted meant that from
terror the words could not be spoken, but
he wished for time. It was given. Dur
rant made his speech, repeating again
and again his innocence.' -After a dra
matic pause the noose dropped, followed
by the black cap; a hand was raised, the
body- fell and hung motionless. "Very
successful," wrote the y hangman in the
little record book. -
George Clark of, Santa Rosa, who killed
his brother,' was the last man that Lunt '
assisted in hanging, and it must have
given â¢ him, great satisfaction, if such a
mild-mannered man could take satisfac
tion in hanging even the worst "men.
-; There is. many a man in California who
can show you a bit of rope an inch or so^
Hansen's body was taken and cared fop
by. a Miss Peterson of San Jose, to whom
he was engaged. Ten physicians wera
present at this hangingâ three for eauch
man hanged, and it was said that tha
other four were for the United States
Marshal in case he suffered from heart
failure. f'-Â£;'
A spectacular hanging was that of Han
sen and St. Clalr. alleged mutineers oÂ£
the crew of the Hesper. They had been
tried for an offense on the high seas In a*
United States court and were sentenced
to Â¦ be executed by the then Marshal,
Barry Baldwin.
Baldwin was a mild-mannered, tender
hearted man, and his nervousness j and.
terror were so pitiable that even the pris
oners felt sorry for him and asked that
he be not brought around lest their cour
age should fail as well as his. On tha
morning of the execution Baldwin rein- -
forced his spirits until he was able to get
to the condemned men's cell and read
their death warrants, but he mumbled
rather than spoke, and, partly supported
by Hale, he was assisted up the stairs.
Â¦Lunt and the man who helped him wars
not mated in speed, and for a full min
ute after Lunt's man was ready to bÂ«
dropped the other was bungling with his
noose. At last . he was ready, but Bald
win was dazed and could not give the sig
nal. The muffled prisoners stood In
silence upon the traps. The wait seamed,
interminable. The gallows frame began
to shudder from the combined trembling
weight upon it and the tense condition of
all muscles.
The gallows frame rattled, and tbe*Â«
was every chance that the men would
faint from the suspense and the choking
of the rope about their necks. At last
some one out of pity for the men g&vo a.
signal and the traps fell together. ,
Freeman Smith, who was in the death
cell waiting his turn, made many Jokes
before Fredericks' hanging, but after it
was so upset .that he asked that none be
permitted to come to his cell.
Smith's own execution occurred In
August. He was much afraid that the
gallows would not be strong enough to
hold him, as he weighed 220 pounds.
When Lunt brought him Into thÂ«
executing chamber he looked carefully
at the apparatus and finally concluded
that it was all right. But Smith had mis
calculated where weakness lay. It was In
his own neck, which was completely sev
ered except for one small cord. Long;
confinement in jail and prison had mads
him soft and flabby and the rope cut
through. This in spite of the fact that ha
was given but five feet of drop, whila
Fredericks had just had seven.
The miserable man glanced fearfully up
at the rope and then fastened his eyes
upon It and became oblivious of every
thing, j
He had. prepared his dying statement,
but had not memorized it "well enough to
carry him through the terror of the occa
sion and became stage-struck.
He* simpered like a schoolboy and
the -quiet Father Lagan prompted him
through his last speech.
As Fredericks shot out the last word,
"amen," Lunt dropped the noose over hla
head. <
' "Make It tight," said Fredericks, and
even as he said it his own weight did so.
Soon after the triple hanging of June
7 came that of Fredericks on the 28th oJ
June, 1S95, which was a. busy year for
the San Quentin gallows. Fredericks had
killed Cashier Herrick, quite bravely for
a murderer, as it was done in broad day
light, but he lost his grit, when he cams
to pay the penalty. Lunt helped him up
the steps, for he seemed to need the sup- .
port.
.Father Lagan, the Catholic priest of
San Rafael, who had gone upon the plat
form with him, spoke the few word*
which Collins had not tongue to say, but
had wished to appear as his death state
ment. Then the trap sprung: again and
Lunt walked away smoking a cigar.
"Quite cool,. isn't ho?" said the on
lookers.
Not so Warden, HalÂ©.
"While Azoft was going through his ter
rible death struggle a cousin of Harris
gripped Hale warmly by the hand and
thanked him for putting the slayer of
his. cousin out of the way. It shocked
Hale beyond measure to think how he
was looked upon. *Â¦}â¢'.'Â¦Â£'Â¦

TITE; SUNDAY CAX.L,:
THE HAUNTING OF AMOS LUNT-HANGMAN1T is a royal death to die by the hand
of an assassin.
The Â¦word is derived from the name
of a band of Mohammedans, who
used secret murder of those in power
es a means to accomplish their ends.
From that time down it has been a mark
of di&tinction to be selected by them and
â¢ their successors in method for extinction.
The assassin on'y glorifies the man
Whom he attempts to injure and injures
the cause which he foolishly seeks to aid.
It is a royal death, and from time when
the first man raised himself above his
fellows by superior attainment it has
been the custom of underlings of human
ity to make mortal marks of those who
chine most brightly.
Assassins make history, but history
makes no assassin famous. It is the de
light of the historian as of the reader to
forget the name of the man who commit
ted the deed, and double the glory of the
one who suffered. Oblivion is the best
punishment of the regicide and his repub
lican prototype who would slay Presl-'
dents.
Since the time of the killing of the first
President, Lincoln, there has been an

and crowned heads. The killed Presidents
were Lincoln, Garfield, Carnot of France.

and Diaz.
The score on the Kings' side of death's
register is an even tally with that of the
Presidentsâ five killed and two 'notable
attacks. The killed were Sultan Abdul

There is a sinister evenness about it all
which, coupled with the smooth way that
things are planned to go in Russia, em
phasizes strongly the old saying about
the uneasy feelings of those who wear
crowns.
It Is usually the good and just rulers
who are attacked, rather than those iron
handed men who crush all beneath them.
While there is some uniformity in this,
there Is none In the class of the assas
sins. They act under all sorts of various
motives, but seldom with what even the
most unjust could call sufficient provoca
tion.
Of all assassinations from the time of
Julius Caesar down to the present day
there has never been one which seemed
half so terrible, so picturesque, so dra
matic as that of Alexander of Russia,
who was blown to pieces by a bomb on
the 13th of March, 188L
To begin with, he was the" mildest ruler
the country had ever known. He ha<X
liberated a nation of serfs, as had the
illustrious American who suffered the
Fame fate before him. Forty million Rus
sian subjects thanked Alexander for free
dom.
A sudden death, striking unexpectedly,
is more merciful, but that of the Czar
came on by degrees. From every side the
threats were pouring. If he traveled he
could not leave his car window open but
letters, black-bordered, fluttered in. warn
ing him of his destruction. When he ar
rived at his destination there were warn
ings upon the tables and warnings under
the pillows. When his valet brought him.
fresh linen there were more warnlngs v
tucked into the fresh laundered appareL
Every little while these warnings were
punctuated with a little comma of a
bomb, which fizzed and sputtered' out
under a carriage, or a vast mine wasfired
beneath palace or train.
The nerves of the Czar stood the strain,
but his wife, frightened to death by the
terrific surroundings, the death so sure,
yet so delayed, was slowly dying, yield
ing her life to the unseen power.
The first of the direct attempts to de
stroy the Czar was the one made just as
he was returning from a visit to Sevasto
pol, in the latter part of November, '79.
There had been two or three mines found
under the track before the train got to
Moscow, and fearing others, the officials
cf the railway determined to reverse the
usual order In which the Czar traveled
and put his train in front of the pilot
train which was run over the tracks to
test them, and incidentally carried tha
baggage. Just as the train of the Czar
entered Moscow there was heard a thun
der roar to the rear and it was found
that, as anticipated, the conspirators had
supposed the fated man to be in the last
train and had destroyed it.
From that time on until the death of
the ruler it was one continuance of
bombs, mines, letters containing poisons,
and all that destructive ingenuity could
plan to end life.
On 'one occasion, as told by the Prince
Alexander of Hesse-Darmstadt, he had
been invited to take dinner with the
royal family. Accident delayed him and
he arrived at the palace half an hour
late. He joined the party and they were
proceeding rapidly . toward his Majesty's
rooms, when suddenly there was a fear
ful thundering sound. The palace rocked,
the floors heaved as in an earthquake,
and all the lights disappeared at once!
The air was filled with dust and choking
fumes. The Emperor was, first to go to
ward the scene of. the wreck, which was

occasion Morelos had the satisfaction to

he, had hoped. The Mexicans repulsed the
Spaniards, who fled precipitately. So
Completely was Calleja discouraged that
he wrote to the viceroy for a siege train.
His â¢request was immediately complied
with and reinforcements arrived.'
An expedition against Valladolld was a
failure.' The tide ;of battle", had turned.
One more glorious victory remained to
him. It was during this battle that the reg
iment of Asturias, which had been at Bay
len and- won there the cognomen of in
vincible, was cut off. This is not the only
instance in which reputations won in the
peninsular campaigns , were lost In Amer
ica. -The capture of this regiment, com
posed altogether of Europeans, was con
sidered to have finally destroyed the pres
tige of .-.- Spanish :. superiority which had
long trembled before the fierceness of the
attacks of Morelos. <â¢ â¢
After completing the conquest of the
rest of the province he convened Congre33
and declared the independence of Mexico.
_Oaxaca . was /commanded by Briga
dier. Regules, who sought to defend it.
The artillery of the Insurgents soon si
lenced that of Regules,- but they were
unable to follow up their victory because
the city was surrounded by a moat full
of water, over which there was but one
bridge, and that was elevated and the
approach defended by the royalist Infan-
The besiegers paused, at this obstacle,
when Guadaloupe Victoria swam the
moat, sword in hand, and cut the. ropes
of the bridge. Thus the battle was won
and the capital and vale of Oaxaca taken
possession of by Morelos.
He then undertook the famous expedi
tion against Oaxaca, the most beautiful
spot of all Mexico. At that time there
were no roads In Mexico, excepting those
connecting the great cities, and the army
suffered many hardships on this march.
Meanwhile Morelos. after recovering
from a slight Injury, defeated three Span-'
ish divisions and made a triumphal entry
into Tehuacan on the 16th of September,
1812.' â¢ Â¦ ..
Calleja was for, a long time afraid to
enter Cuautla; when he, did it was to com

cur, for a general dispersion and to ren
dezvous at Izucar. #
So well was it effected that, like the
children of the mist, the patriots became
invisible. The royal troops, completely
amazed, began to fire on each other.
When the "lost army"- reached Izucar
there .were but seventeen men missing.
The army had dwindled down to 500.
Morelos got word that one of his faith
ful lieutenants had collected another SCO
men at Puebla, and he set out to join the
forces. In doing so he had to march sixty
leagues across a country in possession
of the royalists. His messengers were
captured, so that his friends did not know
his position, and the royallsta, having as
certained how feeble he was, attacked
him in a mountainous road. He ordered
Don Nicholas Bravo, who was hl9 aid, to
continue his march with the main body
of .the troops that they might escape ani
be an escort for the Congress. Morelos,
with a few men, endeavored to check the
advance of the Spaniards. Most of the
fifty men who remained with him aban
doned him when the firing became hot.
But he succeeded in gaining time for hi^,
men to escape, which was his great ob
ject.
The royalist3 did not venture to advance
upon him till only one man remained by
his side. He was then taken prisoner.
He had wished to end his days by a
proof of his devotion to his country,
worthy the most brilliant part of his ca
reer, but his story ended as did the final
chapter of every great patriot who fought
for the independence of Mexicoâcon
demned to death, degraded and shot.
-The only thing that he seemed to mind
was his degradation. It was a humlliat
.ing ceremony in itself, but rendered dou
bly so in his case by its publicity.
He was executed in the hospital of San
Cristoval in the City of Mexico. He con
fessed himself, and walked with the most
perfect serenity to the place of execution.
The short prayer which he pronounced
there deserves, to be recorded for its af
fecting simplicity: "Lord, if I have done
well, Thou knowest it: if ill. to Thy infi
nite mercy I commend my soul."
After this appeal to the Supreme Judge
he took the handkerchief which he ha
bitually wore bound around his head as a
relief from the headache and fastened it
over hi3 eyes. Tb.en he gave the soldiers
the signal to fire and met death with aa
much composure as he had ever shown
when facing it on the battle field.
The heroic days of the revolution ter
minated when Morelos disappeared from
the field, and the war of independenca
was almost over.
This was the dark period of the war.
Congress was driven from place to place,
but in spite of its wanderings continued
its labors and put forth the constitution
of 1814.
Matamoros, one of the bravest of tha
Mexican generals, was taken prisoner.
Morelos tried in vain to exchange him for
the prisoners of the Asturias, but Cal
leja, who was viceroy, was inexorable and
ordered Matamoros shot. Then the reb
els took a horrible revengeâ all of their
prisoners were put to death.

one Cossack as attendants. For con

There is on the part of the assailants

There is perhaps one surprising 1 thing
about it all, and that is that the Spanish
Americas have contributed but two killed

people that the regular method of calling
an election In Central or South America
is by killing the President. Revolutions
there are without end or number. When

Thus it is that in the latter half of this
century have been nearly all of the ar
tacks upon representatives of power. Tha
next on the list is the great world-stirring
shooting of Lincoln, and from that tima
on, as will be seen by the comparative
list in the beginning of this account,
rulers have fallen thick and fast, evenly
divided. President and - King, dead for
dead and wounded for wounded.
The first break in the regal peace was
the stabbing of Queen Isabella' of Spain
in 1852. In 18SJ an assassin opened fire on
the great Victor Emanuel. and King Fer
dinand of Naples was stabbed in ISoG.
Napoleon III was attacked by Orsini in
1858, and King Otho of Greece was shot

a baker boy, who was on the sidewalk.
The Czar saw the wounded men, knew
that in the excitement they might >7be

dered the coachman to stop, but the man
had .'been previously instructed privately
by members of the royal family that un

the cord en the coachman's arm to such

horses and the kind-hearted monarch got
out of the droschky and went to attend

This second bomb completely blew off one

How deep his penetration of the condi
tions -was, time, and a short time at that,
has proved. Japan has shown herself
not only willing but able to learn the les
sons that Europe and America had to
teach her, and her quickness is becoming
proverbial.
I remember well enough all the refusals
that the Americans met with when they
drew near the islands in '53. Men In boats
came out to inform us that it would be
utterly impossible for us to effect a land
ing at any point. Japanese guard boats
came off the land in pursuit of us. Many
of the people had been on board the
Columbus in the Bay of Yeddo and had
shown themselves friendly and quite will
ing to accept American hospitality; but
they were decisive in their refusal to let
us land.
Perry accomplished â¢what he wished in
the end by means of long diplomacy. He
sent letters and received them. President
Killmore had given him one to the Em
peror, It opened in thiswise:
"Great and good friend: I send you this
public letter by Commodore Matthew C.
Perry, an officer of the highest rank in
the navy of the United States. I have di
rected Commodore Perry to assure your"

adopting our ways, our inventions, so
fast that it looks as if she might be teach
ing us things some day; while China has
shown herself superstitiously afraid of
innovations.
But in that day Japan was, of her own
will, isolated from the rest of the world.
Perry had studied the matter as thor
oughly as he could from books on the
subject, and he had arrived at the con
clusion that the nation had isolated itself
as the result of peculiar circumstances,
not because it was by nature conservative
to so unfriendly a degree.
Other nations had attempted to force
it to obey their wishes. Japan would not
endure this, and the result was its pe
culiar position. It was misunderstood, he

We spent the Fourth of July that year
on the voyage. A few days later the
squadron anchored off the city of Uraga
and came face to face with some Jap
anese fishing junks. Their crews stared
in the greatest astonishment at us. lit
tle guessing our determination to come
much closer to them before the affair of
our trip was terminated. Those Japanese
who looked upon him then could little
estimate the kind of material that Perry
was made of; a man who would never say
die, and who, having induced the Govern
ment to fit him out with an expedition
for Japan, was going to enter Japan be
fore he left its shores. For Perry had
been to much effort, you remember, to
get the squadron furnished him in the
first place.
The war with Mexico was closed; Cali
fornia belonged to the United States; we
were ready to reach out, he argued. Xot
for further possessions, but for more
friends.
California being ours, we were now
neighbors, only one ocean across, of
Eastern Asia. It was high time that we
set up neighborly relations with the in
habitants of that Asiatic coast.
Japan was the land that seemed to in
terest him most. China was already
somewhat known. But Japan had for
long years kept herself apart from other
nations, living her own unknown, life.
Human curiosity was enough to stir any
one to a desire to penetrate the islands.

rative how thÂ« natives received us
in the summer oÂ« "K. How .they refused
to let us land, knowing nothing of our

execution.

It all comes from trying to keep up with
the times. I know young pepole are prone
to say that we older men are old fogies
and that we are behind the times, but
every man who has reached m>* years and
traveled through all the walks of life will
tell you the same things. When there is
Â«trife and discontent, bitter longings and
a craving ambition to be on the top. there
is always bound to "be trouble. That' is
the spirit of to-day.. There is. a 'grand
scramble, and every young man is looking
out for himself to-day, but not thinking
of the morrow.
Unfortunately that is the very reason
why so many of them end disastrously.
They live beyond their incomes , and con
sequently get into debt. Then, as there is
no possible way of getting out of it and
still keep up appearances on their, earn
ings, they stejil, they default, they, ruin
their fair name and disgrace the family
If they have any.
The boys of to-day who bet, run about
and who live finely on a small' salary do
one of two thingsâ either find out that
real trouble is ahead of them and- pull
themselves together before it is to^ late,
or else plunge in head over heels. .
tiful clothes â and her father is well able
to back her up in it â the girl whose father
possesses only $15,000 or 120,000 wants
dresses just like them. Even the maid in
one's home feels better satisfied if she has
an imitation of her mistress* best gown.
There is no distinction whatever. .Again,
if one girl gives a tea, her neighbor tries
to ou do her, regardless of the cost. It is
a struggle to put the best foot forward.
The expense never seems to be consid
ered.
I believe in young people having a good
time â just as good a time as they can pos
sibly have, for they will only be young
once; but they ought to keep within cer
tain bounds. The only way to succeed is
never to plan a garment Â¦ larger than . the
cloth that one possesses. I have made it
a life-long rule never to exceed my own
boundaries. 'If I only got $10, a month
that $10 had to do somehow. It is wisest
never to owe any man a cent.

Here are- the views of some
prominent people, all well knozun
socially and zvcll knozvn in clubs.
'Most of them could not deal with
the boys alone. The girls must
necessarily be brought in, as they
contend that the best part of the
lavish expenditure is due to the
whiles and whims of the ladies.
Do these five people agree or dis
agree?
DO I think the young people of to
day spend more money than the
ones of a former generation? <:.â¢;.'.',
Yes. for the natural trend of a
so-called civilization is a growth
from simplicity to greater elabor
ation. In this world of changing customs
it requires a constant readjustment of tho
exacting present and the young people of
to-day are confronted with different cus
toms from the ones which environed their
parents and grandparents.
Take, for instance, the Items of dress.
If a young lady of a quarter of a century
ago wished a new gown she would have
to go through the slow process of a, dress
maker's demands, and fortunate was she
to have it sent home in a fortnight. But
the miss of to-day can go to a clothing
establishment, select a dress, completely
finished in every respect, and unless she
hurries home it will reach . there before
she does. When things are obtained so
easily it is a constant temptation to reach
for them and to- have more and more.
Formerly' a lady bad to prepare all of
her wearing apparel, now she finds in tha
shops everything needful and arranged in ,
such an attractive and bewitching manner
that it would be hard for a Martha' to
resist.
The young men are confronted with the
same conditions, for they are able to buy
everything from underwear to evening
dress in one store. The shop people un
derstand their business and the various
articles are arranged to attract first the
eye and then the purse.
Another demand for the expenditure of
money is to be suitably dressed for the
many games that are in vogue. The maid
of the past thought the aim in life was
Mrs. Ada Van Pelt.
are earning small salaries sent in contri
butions and asked us not to mention it... I
do not know, exactly why.
Since the; war we haven't needed money
urgently and, of course, the supply has
fallen off. But" in j the last few 'months 1
have received over $1000 from young men
alone. Â¦ Simply because 1 wrote and asked
them to become life" members of the Red
Crosf -y '
The girls may spend as much monsy, or
nearly as. much, as the chaps, but they
have more to show for it: if nothing- else,
new clothes, r.nd some new trinkets. But.
then, perhaps thut might be 'expected.
The boys' leave home at say S:30 and-,
they wander down town. They meet some
other fellow, and then cigarettes are in
order, an<? ten to one a drink. That prob
ably costs i>0 or 75 cents. "Come on. let's
go to the theater," says one of them, and
the others' "all right" is not at all back-'
ward.. There goes more money. Then
they saunter to' some 'popular cafe, and
money slips through their fingers like
water.
. And cigars count up too. Most of the
young bloods will not look at anything
less than' a two-bitte/. However, I do not
think- that any of them realize that they
are extravagant: but when three or four
1 do not think a man ever commences
to think and plan for the future until -he
has reached, well, about 40 years of age.
Then he ought to know enough to provide
for. old age; but some of the old boys are
every bit as foolish as the younger gen
eration.
And he was about right. So in one sense
the young people are spendthrifts. They
spend all they can get their hands on,
and never have anything to show for it;
You cannot put an old head on young
shoulders.
WHAT, are the b.oys spendthrifts?
I guers the best answer that I
can give you is a remark that
James C. Flood once made to
me. Said he: '-'Wells, I Â¦ know
people, as they are when they drop their
masks. You know I've kept a saloon long
enough to see lots of people, and when a
man ,comes in to get a drink he is very
apt to appear perfectly natural. He
spends his money ireely and treats all his
friends royally.- The troubles of the day
are forgotten for the time being. I tell
you that fortunts are daily spent in drink.
Any fool can make a fortune, but it is a
wise man who can keep it. I have the
greate&t respect for such a man." Â¦ Â¦ ;

Nine out of ten people -don't know that
the treasury receives a certain amount _
monthly that might have been; spent in
races, games and drink. Never once
have I asked for assistance from any' of
the young men, and been refused.
At New Year's, time the clubs of San'
FrancisccH-Bohemian, University and Pa
cificâutterly failed to respond; didn't
even buy.; a package, while the theaters
came up beautifully. They always do,
by the way. -T : â¢
But that takes the men as a mass;, and
then besides New Year is a bad time to
expect anything. It's too close to Christ
mas, which means a flat pocketbook. I
know the men have clubs and forty-eleven
amusements that are attractive and ex
pensive, but, as I said before, the girls/
are usually along wjien money is being
spent. It costs more for three â you and
I- and a] chaperon â than for. one. . .-'
The boys have their hish jinks and their
low downs, but I, do not think that any
great amount of money is thrown to the
tli.gs-, and I do know that many a poor
fellow who Was down has been given a
helping hand.
How many young men go to church?
Our boys are not t-ompeiled to attend any
services: nothing: is obligatory: but such
an influence can certainly do no harm
and may do some little good for the ris
ing and expanding generation.
The Young Men's Christian Association
was not intended to reform people, but to
exert a good influence whenever possible,
and to furnish mffst of the amusements
that the clubs afford at a decidedly cheap
er rate. There is no bar in connection
with the building, hence no drinking or
draining: the pockets for liquors. Neither
do we have boxing tournaments or so
< ailed amateur bouts, where betting is
freely indulged in and where money
changes hands rapidly. So much hard
earned money goes just that way, but
ycung fellows are very apt to think such
things are mamy, and so that settles the
qrestion.
I wish the boys spent their money on
the girls. Not nearly so much would van
ish in smoke, the influence would be much
better and everybody would be happier.
But they don't. Most of it is spent on I,
either amusing or dressing I â but always
for the benefit of I.
The spirit of rivalry has never died out
and never will. The v/mng fellow who
gets a much smaller salary than his next
door neighbor tries tÂ»> go about as much,
spendâ his money as freely/ and. have his
tailor keep him as spick and span as his
more fortunate friend. ? -
Another and quite as common a way of
getting rid of money is to try to keep up
with the times. Everybody understands
that.
Too expensive cigars are indulged In and
too many of them. Many men think that
good tobacco is a real .luxury, but tha
boys who can't afford to smoke at all al
ways seem to find money for them.
The idea of eating and drinking up
nearly a month's salary certainly isn't an
economical one. As soon as possible wo
intend to have a dining-room in connec
tion with our rooms, where a man can
buy a good substantial meal and put away
a. little money.
Girls don't go to restaurants and spend
50 cents or $1 for lunch and twice as much
for dinner. Once a month, maybe, but
not as a role. They are naturally much
more saving. But it's a common occur
rence with the boys; in fact, as everybody
knows, a daily one.
Perhaps it's the spirit of the times when,
money slips through the fingers so easily.
At any rate it goes, and goes in large
quantities, and there is little or nothing:
to show for it.
The young men of to-day seem to have
a sublime indifference as to the welfare
of the morrow. They don't seem to think
6t the possibility of any future business
for themselves and" the necessary capital
to begin on, or If they do It is a very
haz>' dream in a far away and misty time.
places. But, like most Americans, they
must be up and doing. They are under
a perpetual strain to 'keep up and appear
well in the eyes of the world.

THERE >s no doubt in my mind that
the young men of this city spend
much more money than is good fbr
them. But it is the spirit of the
times, rather than that there Is any
thing materially wrong with the boys,
and, I misht add, the girls. Â¦;;-."Â¦â¢
When I was a boy wealth was not
counted as it Is now. People did not
struggle and aim 'so to get the almighty
dollar. If a man had a monthly salary of
;510 or $12 and h's board and lodging he
, was satisfied. His clothes were rough
..and substantial, but they did not cost him
hi* entire year** earnings, and sometimes
rraore too. At the end of the Sear he had
more ready cash than the man who gets
I rive or six times as much now. And, more
â¢ to the point, he was happy, contented and
j thoroughly comfortable.
In those days a woman was considered
" fairly well dressed i^she wore a neat cal-
Llco gown and a hat to match.* Now calico
does not go at all.
, The desire to spend money Â£omes early
in life these days. I used to think I was
Â» wealthy if I had a 5-cent piece to spend,
and often put it away so that the pleasure
would be deferred. Children of to-day
icimply do not know the value of money,
vf.nd even when they are grown they never
seem to fully realize it. It comes easily
;and it goes just as easily. â¢Â¦-
'. I consider the racetrack one of the
/evils of the day. for our boys throw their
;iaoney away there. Then they belong to
jVxpensive clubs and frequent cafes.' Be

far. too^ extravagant in all - their tastes,
and It would be a pood thing if they could

The *klrls are not called upon to spend
their money that way. They go to the
theater and ; then to supper, but it costs
them nothing but to be sweet and ami
able.' If they, have a caller at home father
pays j for the refreshments, and so they
are in just that much.
But, any way you .,, put It, too much
money is spent foolishly. The Calif or

money here or there is no object to them,
and that is exactly the cause of the trou

vast majority, excepting that it gives
them a good time, and that Is, what they

Arrangements have been made for a
tennis tournament at Congress Springs,
Saratoga, Santa Clara County, commenc
ing on the 16th lnst. and continuing a
week. A long list' of contestants, includ
ing many of the best players from San
Francisco, Oakland, Alameda,- San Jose,
Santa- Clara and Centerville, will take
part in the contests for a number of val
uable prizes. From the arrangements that
have been made it is expected the tour
ney will be one of the most exciting seen
for some time.
The following eld players signified their
intention of trying- for the team: R. S.
Fisher, R. J. McFadden, C. E. Gilman,
Professor C. K. Lewers. Stanford "96 and
assistant coach, said: "We have against
us this year opponents who intend to
make the right of their lives. I think we
have the bc-st chance T)f winning, how
ever, and by a larger score than last year.
If the men will obey training rules."
Captain Fisher followed. Â«tatlng the ob
ject of the meeting and urging the men to
sign for practice and draw out their suits.
"Dad" Moulton was then called for, and
la a few words told of the high reputation
Stanford had in the Kast, of his good im
pressions of the university and the ath
letic material here, and urged the
football men to live up to the coaches*
rules for training. On the last subject he
said: "If anything goes wrong with a man
I expect him to come to me at once.
Smoking and drinking if Indulged in by
you young men must be stopped during
training season. I ask you to live up to
the rules; for ..hey will not be hard and
training will be a pleasure, not a punish
ment."
Coach Fir kef i in giving advice to the
men said: "You must live up to the train
ing rules that are prescribed, otherwise
you will have to sever your connection
with the team. I am going to try to win
but one game, and that Is the Intercolle
giate on November 9. And I think we
t^hall win. although it will not be a 'walk
over.' Every man must get out and work
for his college."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.â Great en
thusiasm prevailed at the first- football
rally of the season, which was held in En
cina clubroom. Head Coach Fickert, As
sistant Coach Lewers, Trainer "Dad"
lioulton and Captain Fisher addressed
the football men and assembled students.
Since the athletes returned from As
toria, where, they were signally successful
in the track and field events, some com
plaints have been heard of the inefficiency
of the Astoria committee, only two mem
bers of which. J. C. McCue and Percy
Sovey. made any real effort to accommo
date the visitors. The rest of the "honor
ables" on the committee contented them
selves with wearing their badges of of
fice and doing nothing in particular.
With regard to the disproportionate
number of "Olympic, men who went north,
it is said the Astoria committee desired
to have them because of their ability to
take part in an indoor entertainment,
such as is given' from time to time in
the clubrooms on Post street. As soon
as- Secretary J. C. McCue of the Astoria
committee reported the > result of his ob
servations in San Francisco it was de
cided to have a dozen or more athletes
from the Olympic Club. '
T^HE oarsmen of the Alameda Boat
â¢'I Club -who went up to the Astoria re
-'1-BaUa returned last Tuesday by train.
The barge and outrigged skiffs were
blistered a little by the heat of the rail
road car, but were otherwise uninjured.
Each member of the crew brought back
a. gold medal Â¦ won in the championship
barge race.- F. "W. Ayers had two, the
extra one- being for the outrigged skiff
race, in which he' defeated S. J. Pem
broke, who went -north with the Olympic
crew. The Alameda Club will. hold its an
nual championship races shortly, and will
probably invite some of the city oarsmen
-to take part In a match'race. Dr. C. C.
Dennis of the South End Rowing Club
has promised to pull in an outrigged s'rciil
race at the Alameda regatta. The Ala
meda men say the barge race in which
they took part against the Portland Row
ing Club was not a serious affair, and that
their defeat in it was not regarded' as in
dicative of the superiority of their op
ponents. The hospitality of the Portland
ers was generous, and the Alameda oars
men were up nearly all the night before
the race. They were in no condition to
do themselves justice.

Light practice continues on the gridiron.
The men are doing good work and are be
ing placed in prime condition by the
coaches and trainer. The freshmen play
ers as a group are heavy men and show
great promise of developing into first
class athletes.
Several of California's crack field and
track men are again in college this year.
Cadogan. the sprinter, is back for work,
and Plaw will whirl the hammer again.
Increased speed is expected from Service,
the star distance man. California has
three good hurdlers of experienceâPow
ell. Hamlin and Cheek. The first and last
named will also be in the high jump.
Track Captain Bussey will continue in
both jumps. Brown, a comparatively new
man, should work up well in the sprints,
and therÂ« is a good field of old men to
pick from in all the events. The fresh
man material is showing up well, "and in
a week or so some individual stars should
come out of the bunch.
Much cf California's success on the cin
der path is credited to fall training. By
this means the men are kept in condition
and practice and when spring comes it Is
not difficult to put them in shape for con
tests. Another plan is being formed for
the benefit of the athletes in the shape
of a series of indoor field days in Har
mon gymnasium this -winter. The meets
Â¦will be both individual and class compe
titions and will take place every month
or six weeks. The gymnasium has on-;
cf the finest indoor tracks in America,
but it has never been used except for
training purposes. Sprints, distances, pole
vaults and high jumps will be the events
for the indoor meets.
BERKELEY, Sept. I'.â University of
California athletic affairs increased
in activity this vÂ«k with the com
mencement of fall track training. A
lr.rge squad, both of old and new men.
hEs appeared en the oval for work, giv
ing to Berkeley track athletics a prosper
ous look.
WHEX the date for the tennis cham
pionship singles was changed from
July to September many thought
a mistake was made. The success
attending the. recent .tournaments make
it evident the change was for the better,
puch tennis as was brought out in the
championship tournaments for both the
women and the men has never before been
seen on the coast.
The Sutton sisters will defend their
titles to the championship of the coast
next year and the southern men, encour
aged by the good showing made by them,
will also try for championship honors
next September. . . .
Much had been heard of the Suttons
prior to their visit, but very few local
people expected to see girls so skillful'
with the racket as these proved to be.
Their work should greatly' benefit the
pastime here. . â¢
While the southern men failed to sweep
. everything before them as the women did,
still they made a good showing and a year
hence will be strong candidates for cham
pionship honors.
The failure of the Hardy brothers for
two years to wrest the championship from
.George Whitney impressed the second
class men with the idea that he was in
' vincible. The recent tournaments showed
that some of the second-class men are.
' rapidly nearing the Whitneys. Some ex
pert judges are of the opinion that their
. -reign over the tennis world is almost at
-an end. In two years, and possibly in.
one. there may be new^ coast 'champions.
'-fimith- -and McGavin, " a-" newly- formed ;
team, although beaten by the Whitneys in
straight sets, played them close and with
a year's practice stand a chance of beat-'
ing them. â â¢ '
< The Whitney-Bell match for the cham
pionship showed that Bell is but little be
hind Whitney in point of skill -and it
would not be much of a surprise if next
year he carrled^off the championship.
. Oakland has been without a tennis or
ganization for several years until tlje Ho
bart "Tennis Club was. formed. Already'
the membership list is large.
The assignment of handicaps is always
a somewhat difficult matter in golf com
petitions, some clubs adopting one method
and others another. In the San Francisco
Golf Club the handicapping is done by
Robert Johnstone, the resident profes
sional, who is so familiar with the relative
strength of the players that his handicaps
nearly always bring out close contests.
Other clubs, as, for example, the Los An
geles Country Club, have an official handi
capper. In the San Rafael Golf Club the
handicaps were at one time allotted by
T. W. Tetley," then the resident profes
sional, and other methods have been tried.
After several experiments the club offi
cials believe they have found a method
of handicapping which is fair and will put
an end to all objections on the part of the
players. Forty-eight is set as the* scratch.
score for amateur men golfers over the
San Rafael course, and in competition
each player receives a handicap of two
thirds of the difference between this
scratch score and the player's best score.
The scores are written up on the bulletin
board and objection, if any is to be made,
must be lodged before play in the com
petition begins. v
On "Wednesday, the 11th lnst.. there was
a competition on the links of the San
Rafael Golf Club for a trophy presented
by Mrs. R. Gilman Brown, to be played
for by ladies.
The San Rafael Golf Club has had an
unusually active and successful season
and its tournaments still attract many en
tries and are well contested. On Admis
sion day the qualifying: round of the com
petition for the championship cup, which
has taken the place of the Council's cup
for men, now the property of B. J. Mc-
Cutchen, took place on the San Rafael
links, the eight who qualified being J. T.
Crooks, R. Gilman Brown, R. J. Davis.
E. J, Hooper, C. A. Belden, C. P. Pome

the competition took place yesterday, the
contestants being paired as follows: R.
J. Davis vs. George Heazelton: Douglas

final round will be played on a day agreed
on by the two contestants. The winner
will be the first to have his name inscribed

WHERE YOU MUST NOT
WEAR A HIGH HAT.
ONE of the indications of the-prob
able disruption of the Austrian em
pire at no distant date, on the
death of the present sovereign, for
instance, is the antipathy of the Czechs
to the high hat. To make your appear
ance In certain parts of Bohemia in such
headgear is distinctly dangerous. You
would not only have It knocked off and
trampled out of shape, but also stand a
good chance of being knocked out of
shape yourself. ' This hatred of the tall
hat . Is aue to the fact that it is mors
commonly worn in Vienna and other Ger
man portions of the empire than outside*
Germanic Austria. The Czechs and the
other races that make up the dominion of
the Emperor Francis Joseph object to the
predomination of the- German aad show
their hatred b^ assailing the tall 'hat and,
of course,, in other ways.â Pearson's

the first opportunity presented to a news
paper man to live with the priests in their
kivas during their ceremonial days and
witness all that thex- did.
The moment I was introduced to Pol
ihungwa, the antelope chief, he named
me Gircfemvoici. or "Black Eyes," be
cause I wore dark-colored glasses. To
W. Simpson of the Santa Fe road he
gave the name of Shiva Mongwe, or
"Railroad Chief." Thg&e names were
adopted by Lomanakshu, the snake chief.
The ceremony of the snake-washing,
which occurs on the afternoon of the
dance, was witnessed by seven white peo
ple at Mishongnovi. One of these was
Miss Frieda Voth. who is the first woman
to ' attend the ceremony in any of the
kivas, and I presume the fact that she
saw the 'horrid affair from first to last
without so much as a shudder was due to
Her long residence among the Hopi and
her familiarity with. the snake dance.
â¢No effort ;rrss mad* to prevent the
harmless . varieties; from biting the.
dancers, which they. did repeatedly. Time
and again the rattlers and the bull snakes
proved too strong for the grasp of the
mouthi and fell writhing to the iirround.
Many times, during the, ceremony a huge
rattler or a fast racer broke through the
circle^ef dancers and was away' into the
crowd of spectators. The escape of the
snake was greeted by a chorus of feml
nineJ screams and , a scattering for places
of safety.
'As, soon as a snake struck" the ground
the "gatherer" was over him, tickling
him with his feather whip. This, never
failed to prevent the Incipient coil of the
deadly rattler, and as soon as the reptile
straightened- out rand tried .to escape the
"gatherer" stooped down and picked him
up, grasping it just back of the head.' r Â¦',
' As - the dance proceeded and all the
snakes had been taken from the kisi the
"gatherers" frequently held unconcern
edly in one hand a bunch of from three
to seven; or eight snakes of all varieties.
The snakes wound and twisted themselves
into indiscriminate -knots in the; ".gath
.erer's'^hand, their heads forming a suf
ficiently, fearsome, group to pleas.e the
; most 'blase spectator. -
'At one end ox the plaza, ,arrang tJ d in a
heads while' the chiefs muttered a prayer
to the snakes, their "elder brothers." ,
Suddenly the snake priests . broke their
line and quickly arranged theriiselves into
groups of three. ' '.
The first in, each: group is called the
'.'carrier, 1 ', the second the "hugger" and
the; third the "gatherer." The hugger in
each group placed his left arm around the
shoulder of the ''carrier" and . both as-'
sumed a crouched _, position. Followed by'
the "gatherers" 'these groups began. their
procession in. front, of the kisi. Each
"carrier',' Jin turn- knelt before the kisi,
drew aside- the curtain,, thrust: his hand
into the concealed bag and a moment later
was on his feet with a snake in" his .mouth'/
The rattles of the antelopes mingled with
their'loud arid guttural ! chanting and the
rattling of the rattles ' of the" snakes was
the. unearthly â¢ music to ;which the snake
chiefs bore their fearful burdens ; around
the dance rock and down the length- of
the plaza, v " - : \ , ..â¢ ':Â¦Â».'â¢ Â¦-" -V â¢
.Almost before I could' realize what had
occurred nine snafie priests were .winding
about with from one to four snakes' in'
their mouth.- their Hpa and ; teeth ' grasp
ing ' the reptiles,' < sometimes : close to the
heads and - at others half-way down thÂ©
..Among the eighty or more snakes used
there were fully twenty rattlers, whose
slightest bite meant death to the dancer; v _
'/ Their fangs were undrawn arid they had"
not been doctored.". - ~Vv
The. other snakes ,were bull snakes,, red
and blue racers and. whip snakes. .\'\ ' â¢,
It was certainly, calculated to send the
cold^shivers along the spine. to see these
men with eyes shut, hands held in a sup-,
plicatory : position,; the unmistakable light
of fanaticism on their faces, circling about
with their' writhing, twisting- and twining
burdeps - depending .'from, their mouths.
The. "hugge'rs"-"- vigorously waved their
whips before' the,- snakes 'to keep them
from ; colling and frequently .used .the'
whips to. pull the snakes- from the hairi
neck and face of the "carrier.".. The rat
tler, cannot strike* when uncoiled and' this
is one secret of their, reckless handling.
The huge bulls constantly wound their
coils . about the neck and arms of . the
"carriers" . and j repeatedly struck .at their
closed, eyes. Frequently, they blt^them
upon the cheek, thrust' heads into their
ears and nostrils, twisted and' wound
themselves in the; long black hair hang
ing", about ; the shoulders of the dancers,"
their -red tongues playing incessantly like
forked lightening.
and from.it depends a sash of liuctrsTitn
fringes.
Down the back from the girdle of 'the
kilt hangs the skin of a fox arid on the
right leg is tied a huge - rattle -made, of
turtle shell. . ' ' '
Each carries a bandoleer of buckskin
string hanging" from the left shoulder, and
all. have snake whips, made of a stick
painted red and bound to whioh are two
etxgle feathers. In his arm the chief ca'r
ries his symbol of office,", the timponi.
Like the' antelopes they circle the plaza
four times, but Koing faster and in a
wider eireu-mf erenee. Occasionally a mere
boy, not over five years of age and who
has just received his initiation in the
kiva,/ stops and swings .his ."bull roarer,"
which is a flat piece of wood tied to . a
long" string:. The'effect-is' that of -a min
iature thunder clap; which mingles with
the. rattles of .the antelopes, resembling
the' patter of falling rain. Almost before
the detail of their costume could be taken
in the snake priests were in line facing
the antelopes. Standing close together
they began in unison with th'e antelopes
a low, solemn and rhythmical chant,
stamiiiiTfe their right, feet .upon the
ground. ' ' â¢ -.;Â¦.'Â¦ â¢ Â¦ . . Â¦ Â¦
i The snake priests"; waved their whlpg
first to the right and then to the left and
the antelopes their .rattles. The effect
upon the nerves was indescribable. Low
and deliberate at first the chant 'rose and
grew in volume until it became a''gut
tural roar. The stamping of. the feet was
varied by a vigorous swaying of the body
forward and, back like the lope of a horse.
Presently theÂ» boy bearing his gourd "of
water broke from' the line and walking
- between the rows of priests sprinkled each
Â¦- and Â¦ also the kisi. The * priest with the
sacred meal did exactly as the boy had
done,with the water.. 'r . * ;'â¢
The chanting lasted, about ten minutes
when it died away 'to a moan. 'The whips
ceased waving and the rattles were qulet. :
There was a moment's" pause,- during
which the' priests remained *with bowed

white clouds and the yellow clouds.
.Four is their mystic number or symbol.
As they pass the kisi where the snakes
are iying each breathes a prayer upon
the sacred meal which he carries in his
hand, sprinkles some of it on , the board
which ' he carries In his hand, sprinkles
some of it on the board which has been
set over a hole dug into the ground' in
front of the kisi and stamps his right foot,
upon the board. This is to give notice
to the spirits that the ceremony is about
to begin.
The circling of the plaza completed the
antelopes line up in front of the. kisi wilh
their hacks to it. The kisi is made of
four eottonwood sticks driven into '. the
ground to a height of four feet and hold
togciher by cross \ sticks. About the
stakes are hound ar.d twisted boughs of
eottonwood to a height of ' fifteen feet.
Reeds are bound * with leather thongs
about the lower portion of the . klsl and
the opening is covered with a blanket.
There is a rmmjerifs pause after the Hrft
up of the antelopes when the snake chief
is seen entering the plaza. He is about
ten feet in advance of his twenty-six de
votees. His head is erect and -he walks
with a fast and long stride. .Down the
entire length, of the plaza they go, the
spectators scattering right and left, the
ttytle-sheil rattles sounding/ like, hail fall
ing on a board roof. Their costume is
even more, striking'^ than that of -the'an
telopes. Their "naked bodies from the face
down are painted. a somber black. Two
large pink spots mark the shoulder blades
and the center of the back bears "a* white'
spot. Their hair, having been ceremonial
ly washed in^seared meal and water! is
adorned by bunches of red and blue feath
ers. The black- of the bodies is further
relieved by large spots" painted on the legs,
the pink alternating with the white. Arm
bands of cotton . root are" worn. A kilt
around the bottom of which is painted the
black zigzag emblem of the snake is worn,
TMAGINE i mesa of solid rock rising
abruptly over 600 feet above a. seem-
I ingly endless expanse of red sandâ a
veritable Gibraltar of the desert. Ap-
Â¦ parently there is no way of scaling
Its height, and yet hidden among the huge
volcanic fragments that the elements
have worn and torn and tumbled helter
skelter down Its precipitous sides are nar
row trails of stone steps hollowed into the
rocks by the continual friction of ages.
Such is Walpl, on the first of the three
mesas that have been the home of the
Hop! or Moki Indians probably since ages
before Columbus began his search for a
new world.
Imagine yourself upon the top of this
mesa. Skirting its eastern^ edge is a
plaza, narrow and long. Plunking it on
west is a row of stone houses rising one
upon the other. If you were to walk 10)
feet to the east you would plunge over
a sheer cliff hundreds of feet below. Gath
ered upon tlie sides of thesÂ» a~c en" dwel"
ings, crowding their top? and tilling every
inch of the spa'-e. are perhaps 200 Ameri
cans, as many more Indians of a half
dozen tribes, Mexicans and even Japa
nese. It is an amphitheater carved by^the
hand of natureâ a stage setting that the
art of man could not approach. The gaudy
coloring of the Indian holiday attire pre
sents a eharp contrast to the more som
ber attire of the tourist, the anthropolo
gist, the ethnologist and the scientist. As
you gaze upon th!s scene you forgot that
thlB is the twentieth century and that not

On the afternoon of AuguM 2K nn Ari
zona Kunnct wan just beginning to mix
pigment* of partl-colorrd hue* to scatter
them Indiscriminately over the wind
beaten and *Â«nd Â«<trewn expanse of thfl
Painter Desert. The blue peaks of the
San Francisco Mountains were recelvins
their baptism of color*. A band of
Etruec.in gold wrapped itself about the
mountains and mingled with the blue and
the brown; the inimitable purple and car*
mine mixed with the red sands of the
desert. The "light that never was on land
nor sea" had '.ast Its spell from horizon
to horizon. In the kivas or underground
dwell!ng8 the make and antelope priests
were waiting their signalâ the dipping of
the sun behind the topmost peak of the
San Franclscos.
Suppressed excitement was everywhere.
An aged priest of the snake order, totter
ing with the weight of years, climbs the
ladder of the kiva.
He bears a sack in his hand, and the
whisper runs along the mesa that the
snakes are coming.
. They are In " the bag, which the priest
carefully deposits in the kisi, not five feet
away from a row of spectators perched
irpon the lower wall of a house.
All doubt regarding the contents of the
bag are dispelled when Major Burton, the
Indian agent, steps forward and requests
the people to remain quiet, ' so that the
snakes may not become excited and there
fore hard to handle.
His words bring a hush over the laugh'
ing and joking assemblage.
From the top of the highest house in
the village a Moki form appears. He is
the town crier who requests that the Nav
ajos deliver their revolvers to the Indian
police and that the Moki women dress
their children before permitting them to
appear upon the mesa.
Parenthetically It is well to state that
the snake dance is purely a religious cere
mony, the culmination of nine days of
ceremonial observances, a prayer to the
gods of the clouds, the rain, the wind, the
thunder and the lightning that sufficient
rain may water the pgrched crops so that
the village may not suffer from hunger,
and thirst. Small wonder that in this
country the inhabitants should worship
the gods that produce rain and should in- ;
voke the aid of Balulukong. the plumed
Berpent who has" supreme power over the
springs and the rain. The snake dance is"*
the climax of this prayer which, barbar
ous though It be. is awe-inspiring in its
intensity.
-The coming of the antelope priests Is
heralded by the whirr of their rattles,
which are made of buckskin rawhide
stretched over a small wooden band or
hoop and inside of which are kernels of
corn and watermelon seeds.
Their dress is fantastic, and ex
travagant to a degree.
Their arms to the elbows and their legs
to the knees are painted white. The chin
Is colored a deep black and a white line
extends from ear to ear over the upper
portion of the lip, giving the face made
gaunt by prayer and fasting a ghastly and
unnatural look. White zigzag lines extend
along the upper arms, down the chest,
thighs and backs. A bunch of eagle feath
ers adorn the hair and some have wreaths
of cotton wood boughs about their heads.
Fancy kilts and sashes are worn. Arm,
wrist and ankle bands, yarn bandoleers,
beads and moccasins complete the cos
tume.
There are twelve, and one of their num
ber bears a platter of sacred meal and
another, a mere boy, an open gourd of
water.
"With solemn and majestic tread the an
telopes begin their circle of the plaza.
Slowly.. they wind about four times, once
tor each of the world Quarters - where
broken semicircle, were groups of maidens
dressed In ceremonial robes of white and
red and bearing platters of meaL As tha
dancers passed them each maiden sprink
led the meal over the face of the dancer
and on the snakes. After about fifteen
minutes of this spectacle the "gather
ers" had secured all the snakes. The
snake chief drew a circle of meal upon,
the ground .In front of the dance rock and
then sprinkled the incloaure wlth^meal.
At a sign from him the gatherers threw
all the snakes upon the bed of meal,
whereupon there was a concerted rush
v for the sickening mass. In an Incredible.
Vfehort space of time every snake hÂ«d been
taken from the ground, each priest se
curing all he could, and all were away
Jhvn the steep sides of the mesa, holding
ihe wriggling serpents aloft.
Each snake was deposited at soma
shrine in the desert, and within a quarter
of an hour all the priests were back and
gathered upon the. plaza on the west side
of the mesa. . . \
Near the rock were standing tubs and
gourds of medicine brewed by the snake
i'womeiKfrom herbs. Into the boiling mass
had been thrown all the "prayer" beetles
the snake priests were able to gather
during the morning: of the ninth day.
Using this limiid. the maidens who had
assisted in* the dance washed the paint
from the bodies of the men, whose only
clothing- was then a breechcloth. ThÂ«
washing finished, the maidens gave a
large bowl of the fluid to each priest, who
drank it in lar^e gulps. The effect was
almost Instantaneous, and kneellns alonaf

violently wrenching. I was told that this

Interpreter to have been poisoned by onÂ«

the evening he partook freely of the
emetic and the next -morning he was as

the saliva he swallowed In carrying thÂ»
snakes or to snake poison I cannot say.

To be thrown upon one's own resources

giving partner a safe finesse against the

When partner has signaled or led

Some ,players-i echo three trumps. It
should be understood between partners
whether they echo three or four trumps

fall to use this conventionality of the
game. ".".Â¦Â¦-. : , ' .. - ' ;
You can echo In the manner you t tak'e a
force. Thus, A has signaled for trumps
and B is forced. He holds the ten, seven,
four and two, of .trumps.', He trumps with
the four and plays out' the two, arid
has echoed four trumps. Had B held only
the ten,- seven and four, | he would trump
with the four, and play out \ the ten,
showing one more or no more. . .

Irregular; a lead which may be made
toward the end of the hand frequently.
When. you can take a trick and still hold
command of ., the suit, holding ace and
king,- you should play king second hand
in plain suits.
If you should hold a double tenace. Ilka
the ace, queen, 10, you should usually play
the 10 to a low card led.
. When an honor Is led do not cover with
another honor unless it is the ace. You
should usually cover an honor with the
ace If you hold It. Â¦ . ,..
When you have 5 or'- 6 In suit and the
ace unless very ; strong -in trumps yea
should play the ace at second hand.

'card w play low, unless the. card led Is
higher than the 6._ '-;-..,.. . .
.Holding three cards, like the 9, 7, 2, ,1:o
the'S led, play the 9; or the king, 9, 2, r.o
the 8 led, play the 9. It may save a hig-'a
card for nartner. .. . . ' .. .
In trumps, with .the king singly guard-
ed, play the king at second hand unless
trumps are led by right hand opponent
in answer to a call from the left hand

make, use of this signal In its simplest
form. Players with - good whist percep

trump lead without waiting for this com

tion many writers on the game differ
upon. Some say you should* hold five
trumps at least; others four, with two
honors. The mere fact of holding. four
good trumps or even, five or six la not a
good reason for the "call." The usual
object of leading out the trumps is for the
purpose of bringing In a long suit or for
the protection of high cards In the dif
ferent suits. If you have not this object
in view you should not call, even though
you have a strong trump suit. Some
times the fall of the cards or partner's
lead will show you that he is strong In the
suits or a suit and it would then be neces
sary to call for or lead trunips right awcy.
The signal can be made with any of the
cards. . Tile ten and then a lower one, or
the nine, etc., reversing the usual order of
play. In reading your partner's signal

of a card higher than the seven of a suit
that has not been played. Thus A and B
are partners. A Iead3 the king of hearts
and B plays the live of hearts. On the
second lead, A plays the ace of hearts and
if B, who is now void of hearts, plays the
nine of diamonds he has issued a call for
trumps. . Had he discarded a deuce or trey
he would be inviting a force and there
fore publishing weakness in the trump
suit.
The advantage of this signal over the
other. lies in the fact that If your partner
is in the lead at the time, the "call" is
answered before the opponents have taken
any advantage of the information In any
way.
There are other ways of making the
trump signalâ by refusing to trump a.sure
winning card or refusing to" take a force
from partner; both are' positive calls for
trumps.
You should be careful about calling
while the opponents are in the lead, for
when you declare strength in trumps
against them they may play for a ruff, or
cross-rtjff.
You should refuse to answer the call if
your right-hand opponent completes a call
at the same time as your partner, for
jou would be leading through your part
ner's hand up to declared strength. Should
your left-hand opponent,.: however, and
your partner call at the same time you
should lead your best, trump through him.
With three cards (of; a; suit led) In'se

of the sequence. If you hold the card next

play of fourth best cards and leads from
high card combinations. Second hand can
sometimes count the cards so as to know
the exact' combinations. They are led
from when he has certain cards in â¢ his
own hand of the same suit. There 'is a
rule, taken from "Foster's Manual,"
called "Foster's rule of eleven," applica
ble when a fourth best card Is led. It is
to deduct from eleven the number of spot3
on the card led, and the remainder is the
number of cards that "are 'against the
leader higher than the one led. If the
eight is led there are three cards higher
than the eight against. the. leader, second

Holding ace, ten, four and two of trumps,
he trumps with the four and leads the
ace. ,The two not. falling to the first
round partner- must give it to him, with
one trump more. Had he trumped with
the two and led the ace partner could
give him but one more trump.

>. Edward's usual incognito -when travel
ing abroad has been Baron Renfew. He
has also been known as. Mr. Moulton. and
in Congtantinople, which the Prince and
Princess of Wales visited soon after their
marriage, the pair went about' through
the bazaars as plain Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liams.
How long will the King live? There Is
an old gypsy saying that tha Princo of
Wales would die by violence as soon as
"a great honor was conferred upon him."
The predictions of this gypsy are said to
have come true in regard to other mem
bers of European royal families. The
King has never shown the slightest fear
of assassination. The Insurance com
panies are rapidly approaching the- limit
of the risk they will accept on King Ed
ward's life. , His expectation, according to
insurance tables, is 14.1 years. Allowance
for moral hazard or the chance of assas
sination, reduces this to ten years.
As a public speaker the King has shown
mastery of such intricate and diverse sub
jects as art. literature, dramatic history,
military matters, engineering, shipping,
civic institutions, the study of the Bible
and mission work, the history of Egypt,
the Irish question, the management of
lifeboats, collegiate education, ambulance
and first" aid training, agricultural im
provements, live stocK breeding, the re
claiming of barren land, the management
of hospitals, the housing of the poor, tho
Darwinian theory, railways and their
management and musical training.
Between January 1 and September 1 of
last year Edward went to forty-three pub
lic dinners and banquets, to twenty-five
garden parties and concerts, thirty times
to the opera and theater, to twenty-eight
race meetings; eleven times he was .In at
tendance at the House of Lords, and he
fulfilled forty-tive official and charitable
engagements.
In his own set his favorite topic of con
versation has been clothes. The Kins
is an expert shoemaker, a handicraft he
chose to learn when a boy, being obliged
by his royal parents to learn some trade."
He has worn shoes of hia own make.
One of the happiest moments of tbe
King's life was when he won the Derby
with Persimmon in i 1896. Shooting, the
King places above all other entertain
ments that carj be offered him. and his
principal visits have always been paid
in the shooting season. Yachting he un
derstands thoroughly. The King is an
inveterate smoker.
Under "Likes and Dislikes." the King
has written in the Duches3 of Fife's al
bum over his signature: "I am the hap
piest when I have no public engagement
to fulfill, when I can smoke a really good
cigar and read a good' novel on the quiet;
when I can, like plain Mr. Jones, go to
a race meeting without being chronicled
in the paper the next morning that the
Prince of .Wales has taken to gambling:
very seriously and lost more money than
he can ever afford to pay; when I can
spend a quiet evening with the Prlnces3
and my family. I am unhappiest when
I have a raging toothache and nave' to a t
\ tend some function where I must smile
as pleasantly as though I never bad a
pain In my life."
Edward VII is rather a light eater, ex-.
cept at dinner, and has never been a
great wine drinker.*
In the matter of gifts the King has been
abundantly favored. They vary in size
from a cat to a hotel. Dogs, cats and other
quadrupeds galore have been given or left
to the King by request. His name b.VS
been mentioned in not far from a hundred
wills as the recipient of the family <3nu,
and on more than one'occasion an annuity
has been left by a testator in order tha:
the maintenance of the animal should be
no expense to the royal master.
One- hobby of Edward's is collecting
crystals. He also knows all about cerr.m
ics and bronzes.
One of the King's treasures is. a solid
gold dinner set, the most magnificent in
the' world. It is valued at *4 ,000,000 and ia
kept at Windsor Castle. Another unlnue
t specimen of it's kind belonging to- Edward
is the state, carriage, which cost $40,000. In
addition to being the most ornate vehicle
in existence It is said to be one of the
most uncomfortable. Queen Victoria never
i used it when she could avoid doing so, a3
jit always gave her a headache. . .Â¦ jj^l

j of England, is a young Lincolnshire
J farmer named Dymoke. He is of a stu-

Almost to the last moment of his life J
a piece of rich waistcoating was as much
an object .of attraction to the great Mar
quis YVeHeslty as it would have been to
any of the most frivolously minded youn?
dandies about the town. Indeed, this
nobleman would frequently sit alone ir. j
solitary stat^. "en grande toilette." with I
his 'blue ribbon and garter, as if about to !
appear at a royal "levee."
In the year 173S there arose on the hori
zon of fashion, cr rather there blazed in
its full meridian, that wonderful phenom
enon of tlegance. George Bryan Brum
mell. Born in 1777. the son of nr. undoc
secretary of Lord North's', and educated
at Eton, he enjoyed the crc'lit of be'ng
the best scholar, the best oarsman and
the best cricketer of the day. Though net '
a gentleman by des-cent. he yet made
plenty of aristocratic friends, and be::;:?
regarded as a sort of "Admirable Crieh
ton" experienced little oilliculty in obtain
ing the entree to Devonshire House,
wncre he was introduced to the Pr'ice
Keger.t. who gave him a. commission in
the Tenth Hussars.
Until Erummeil came upon the scene t!u
prince, though not remarkable for nip
taste, had. thanks to his rank, been con
stituted the "master of elesaccfee," or
Kiader of the dandies; but he was at one*
dethroned by the superior genius of
Brurarncll, who retained the sovereignty
till the year 1S17. During: this period lie
btcame the model of all men who wished
to dress well, and when he had struck out
a new idea he would smile at its graaual
progress townward from the highest to
the Lowest c!a?se?. To the last of his fetay
in England he continued to wear powder,
rather priding: himself upon preserving
this remnant cf the "vleille cour." His
clothes were a perfect study. The coat
was general]}' of tylue cloth, ana its cel

with the cutting out of his thumbs. Three
hairdressers were likewise engaged to.
dress his hair.
As fcr the personal appearance of this
sublime dandy, "his face," we read, "was
rather long, his features neither plain nor
ugly, his forehead unusually high, hair
light brown, v.'hiskers inclined to b2
sandy, eyes gray and full of oddity." His
conversation, without havir.g the wit and
humcr of Lord Alvanley, another of the
dandies, was highly agreeable and amus
ing; indeed, Brummey has never bean
surpassed or equaled since. The Prince
of Wales would frequently come of a
morning to see the beau's house in Ches
terfield street, to witness his toilet, ai'd
to acquire the art of tying his own'nerk
er^hief "a '.la mode." For many years
notwithstanding the great disparity of
rank, Brummell continued the Prince's in
timate friend. At last, however, a cool
ness sprang up between them, and the
- "mirror of fashion" was forbidden the
royal presence.
The Prince â then King â saw the poor
dar.dy once many years after when pass
ing through Calais. Thackeray says;
"The bankrupt Eeau sent him then a
gauÂ£ffcox with some of the snuff- he usid
to love, as a piteous token of i remem
brance and submission, and the King took
the snuff and ordered his horses and drove
on and had not the grace to notice 'lis
old companion, favorite, rival, enemy,
superior!" Brumiaell, of course, ha-1
many successors, but . "the old order
changeth," and none of them ever at
tained to the Olympian heights of his
dandyism, not even the elegant D'Orsay,
who for a time was constituted the ki:i;j
of fashion and held poor Brummell's
scepter.
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE DUDES OF
LONG AGO

The greatest novelty in
the new fall styles is . tl. 3
kimono vi run. The Frene l
have just discovered the
picturesque Japanese gar
ment and t'ney have quick
ly appropriated it for their V
very own, as they always do y
the artistic. Consequently
iipht cloth richly embroid
ered is quite the proper thing
for opera wraps; while dark \.
cloth, trimmed with fur and vel- .
vet. is an all around winter coat.".
The sleeves are quite tight fitting
at the top and slope away to a mod
erate- size at the bottom. Sometimes
row of velvet or fur are put on horizon
tally down the entire length of the sleeve.
Of course, the kimono is double breasted
and is generally finished with a large co'.
lar. â¢ .
But then, again, that is a novelty, and
there are two very distinct objections to
it. First, -that it looks a triile theatrical
and then, again, it costs a small fortune.
One thing is absolutely certainâ it will not
b^ common. No one need fear that.
As long as the kimono is going to be
so rare, something will have to serve the
general public.
The prettiest things for between sea
eons are the Russian blouses of taffeta
or clotb. They are tucked or side plaited,
but never severely plain. The full sleeves
are gathered into 1 a cu2 four inches or
more in . depth, or into a narrow wrist
handf The newest are trimmed with three
little cap*s,. properly ,. : known, jts Carrick
capes. These are in turn trimmed with
ornamental stitching, stitched appUyued
bands or with lace.
Dainty separate belts of shirred black
satin are often worn with the Russian
blouses. Each end has a simple heading
of itself and the, belt hook on the left side
of the front. Both styles are new an-1
very different from the long coats that
have been worn so commonly the past
year. And, by the way. the kings of the
mode say that all coatts will be long, bu:
the best dressed women are saying they
won't wear them. Who will win out?
All the shops say emphatically "this is
to be a velvet winter," and it will be a
pretty change from the chiffon and mou
Â«eline that have been all the rage. Cash
mere, serge and crepe de chine will swell
the list and give everybody a chance to
appear well dressed.
This is justlhe time when all are racto
Ing their brains, about their winter
clothes. Summer garments all look like
laÂ«t year's, and the dressy little miss
fails to feel entirely comfortable in
them. â¢ J
A swell v.ay to make a crepe de chi;ia
is to have the front of the skirt laid in
such tiny tucks, so closely nestled U.- :
gether that they give the effect of a
band of chenille. The lower part i3
trimmed with two slightly graduated
ruffies, each bordered with a shirn.1
puff of "taffeta. This is worn with a
little bolero -of- Black- taffeta with nar
row-basque^'ends behind, over a front
cf guipure. To give* a dainty finishing
iouch, the bolero is laced 'across- tha
front- with black velvet, with hanging
knotted ends:*
Gray will be worn more than ever, ;.
and where could one find a daintie*
color? A -charming gray dress is mad:|
of gray frieze, with the skirt trimmed
with two flat shaped ruffles, piped with
a narrow border of gray taffeta. The
plaited Russian blouse is finished with
three little Carrick capes, one above

The hat is alxvays the first and weight
est consideration. If that is becoming
'.he other articles of dress run in a minor
strain! This year tne y are Huffy, large
md more than swagger looking. But they
â¢ ire the hardest things to wear well that
.â¢ave'ever been invented.
- Take the Gainsborough, for instance. It
s extremely largo, very tilted and lop
-ided and has long trailing feathers ar
ar.ged in a conspicuous fashion. To say
:he hast, it attracts attention.
The one pictured is. of brown â¢ velvet.
That is. the foundation is of velvet. The
crown itself is made entirely of chenille
jir.d the velvet brim is held in place by a
row of tiny steel buckles. The under brim
s a mass of shirieJ and corded plisse
.'eivet. while smuggling close to the hair
s an interwoven knot of cream colored
phss malines. The curious ostrich feath
.ms FÂ«*ep over the brim and add height to
the hat. The very back has a small satin
backed velvet bow that just 'falls over the
hair.
Could any one imagine a hat with any
thing mere or. it?
And yet it is a very keen affair. Eut
how many women can successfully
Â»tar it? Such a hat entirely ruas
away vith a little lady, while a g.rl
with a full face certainly fails to .
look her bast in it. That crea- Â£
lion was made for a fewâ 9 -M
very fewâ people, and so arÂ« m
most of the hats that will be ' m
' worn this winter. It mear.3 f
an all day's business to se
lect the headgear that will
prove satisfactory.
This year, unlike last,
the fashions are late, and
when that is the case be
i svare of your pocketbook.
Mischief is brewirrr-
The daintiest possible gown for evening
wear is made of rose crepe, trimmed with
two kinds of lace,' one of which is blac'%.
The front is tucked In the closest kinds of
tucks. On either side plaitings of ros:e
mousseline de sole are let in, mingling
with black and white lace." The lower
part of the skirt falls in two ruffles, each
bordered with white lace over black. To
finish the waist at the belt a sash of biac k j
rnousseline with long ends is worn and
a full tucked ruffle .. of 'â¢ the , mousseline
bordered with a tiny shirred puff borders

. Tulle, mull and landsdown will be qult'efii
the proper CRper. This is not a stiff yesLi\ â¢
in fact everything Is built on exactly^ trie j
other plan. Everything that is particu- j
larly tit and fine will be soft an.il' clinging..
And there is another radical change, too.
Instead of combining all- sorts^ of bright,
colors in the body of a sown the effect!
will bo carried out -as far as possible In
the one tone. The bright notes may be.
suggested in vests, or perchance in. the.
collars, but , there will- be " only a hint/.
Velvet will. lend, the helping hand that
wii! be needed to fill in that gap. " '
The shirt waist cirlhas not seen fit zo
dispose of her beloved separate wairft aa
yet. Every once in a while some authority
startles those who love comfort by saying
that the tight, boned waists are to foe
the only proper things to appear in out
.side of one's home. V.
'. However, popular usage has decided
otherwise and soft, cashmeres, albatross
and and French flannels will be
worn as much as ever, if' not more 'so.
The swellest colors are bright and dark
red, a French blue, gray and a light green.
One of their chief beauties is that they
can' be- made at home. There is no lining,
but a yoke effect back and front will keep
the waist from pulling and ' give it a
neater Â¦ appearance as well. Tucks are
pretty.- but an awful nuisance for a be
ginner to make, and so all amateurs will
. be delighted to know that all sorts of
â¢ Oriental- braids, Persian silks, fancy but
tons \and stitchings Â¦will be every bit as
smart as the myriads of baby tucks..
.Then comes the trouble about the
throat. The troublesome little collars are
what bother nine out of ten women.' A
gown may. be ever' so dainty and freah
and a soiled or rumpled neck finish will
ruin the entire looks more completely and
quicker, thun anything else/
As all- neckwear costs it small fortune
- at any store that can' afford to carry n
decent supply, and aa ail are equally per
ishable, it is a splendid idea to manufac
ture one's own. Get a small, piece of vel
vet or silk to match.* the waist and coyer
it with lace, either a black or a white.- 'Ho
much, so good. Then take a piece ot
citrpe or soft silk and encircle the neck.
When it is caught together in front in
any of the numerous ways that will aI
, ways suggest themselves, nothing could be
r uiimtitr, or less expensive. If the gown
is elaborate, put an open pattern of. 4aÂ«:e
on the. ends, or pake it of panne , velvet
and" have the ends frilled with lace,
ivfcally the. most serviceable one of all is
ncaqe- of black velvet. And when it is
he.u in- place by a bright brooch tne sum
; ber look is taken away.
' -A3 tne Jrtistic eltect of this season'8
gowns, win append in a great measure
,'upon. the fanttful stock, tne odd girdiaa
.' aniiy -the elaborate sleeves, everybody
;.ought to give them the lion's share of

It. is diriicutt to tell whether the cape
. eflector the jacket idea will carry tne
day. Both aie. mighty nobby. Girdles
aits made of silk and velvet, panne and
lace, satin and fur and nearly everything
eise unaer the sun. Almost any, combina
tion seems to be the propÂ«r! "thing. By
people who can afford them, . the 'simplest

about, "the simple white frock." But

well filled- with shekels to s'atisfactori.y
pay the bill.'and that is why the major
. ity_ of us wear the frilliest kind/of fur

12- The body will lie in state in the rotunda of the Capitol until 11 o'clock Wed
nesday, forenoon. . At 12 o'clock "Wednesday the public funeral "service will be
held at the rotunda. At 1, o'clock the body will be taken, under military escort,
followed by the funeral procession, in accordance with the precedent in the case
of .President Garfleld, to the Baltimore and Potomac, station, and the funeral
The funeral train' will leave Buffalo at 8:30 Monday morning, and Is 'expected
to arrive at Washington at 9 o'clock Monday evening. At Washington the body
will.be taken from the train to the executive mansion under escort of a squad of
cavalry, to remain under a. guard of soldiers and sailors until 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning, when it will- be taken to the rotunda of the Capitol under the same es
cort of cavalry.
: Secretary Cortelyou to-night gave out the following order of the movement
of , the funeral ceremonies: . (
"There s wlll be a private ceremony at tha Milburn house on Sunday, Septem
ber 15,' at 11 a.* m., consisting of reading- from the scripture, prayer by Rev. Dr.
Lock and the singing 'of a hymn. Immediately after, this service the remains of
the late -President will be taken to the Buffalo City Hall under the escort of
one company of regular troops, one campany of marines, one company each of
the. Buffalo regiments of the National Guard. The body will lie in state at the
City . Hall, .affording the citizens of Buffalo, an opportunity to pay their respects
until 'nightfall. The time will be approximately from 10 to 6 o'clock. The body
will- remain at the City Hall under a guard of regular soldiers and sailors on
Monday until 7:30 a. m., when It will be taken under the same escort to tha
funeral train at the- Buffalo union station."
Order of the Funeral Ceremonies.
But whether this theory is established or not. it seems probable that the re
sult of the autopsy will give rise to a medical 'controversy/The gangrened condi
tion of the interior ' v/ounds which the physicians thought were healed; and
the fact, that the physicians announced positively that- 'the kidney which the
bullet tore in Its passage through the abdomen was uninjured, were so contrary
to what was expected by the public after the statements of;the physicians dur
ing the progress of the case that its discussion seems inevitable. The poisoned
bullet theory might, of course, account for the sudden and puzzling reversal of
McKinley's condition just when the- physicians laid such great stress on his Im
proved condition and save such' strong hopes of his recovery. The bullet was not
found, .although "an hour's search was made for it. The X-ray apparatus was
not at hand for the use of the physicians and the location of the bullet is still
unknown. .
A chemical. and bacteriological examination of the remaining bullets In the pis
tol will, however, confirm or demolish this theory, and such an examination will
undoubtedly be mde at once by tha authorities.
The report of the autopsy has again given rise to the theory hinted at a day
or two after the President was shot â that Czolgosz in order to insure the accom
plishment of "his purpose poisoned the bullets that v/ere fired. The gangrene found
in the path of the bullet is thought to be strong evidence in support of this view
by Dr. Wasdin, one of the consulting physicians. . Dr. Wasdin is considered an ex
pert of high standing in the marine hospital service..
No Coroner's Inquest was held. Pursuing the precedent laid down in the casÂ«
of Garfield, the Coroner simply viewed the body this morning and later gave a
certificate in accordance with the result of the autopsy, which declared that death
was unavoidable by any surgical or medical treatment and < was the direct^result
of bullet wounds. The wretch who plunged the world into sorrow will therefore
pay. the penalty of his crime by death In the electric chair. Murder in the first de
gree will be the charge. â¢ . '--,->
Coroner's Inquest Will Not Be Held.
.. A death mask will be made by a Washington artist named Garet. All the
President's relatives and friends agreed that it was desirable that the features of
the martyred President should be preserved for the saKe of history.
Cablegrams, telegrams and messages of sympathy and condolence from all over
the world are arriving by thousands. Mrs. McKinley, feeble and broken-hearted
as she is, bears up under her great sorrow with remarkable fortitude, and Dr.
Rixey says he believes she v/ill be able to go through the trying ordeal of a state
funeral.
The body will be taken to th.3 White House for the night and on
Tuesday it will be formally conveyed to the rotunda of the Capitol
building, where the state ceremonies will ' occur. On "Wednesday the
body will be conveyed to Canton, where it will be interred in the fam-
to have a brief service of prayer at the Milburn residence to-morrow
afternoon and start for the national capital with the body on Monday morning
at 7 .o'clock, but the people of Buffalo expressed such a strong wish to be allowed
to pay their tribute of respect here that it was subsequently decided to hold the
service at 11 o'clock in the morning and the body to lie in state in the
City Hall here to-morrow afternoon. On Monday a special train bearing the
President, Cabinet, Mrs. McKinley, the family and the distinguished personages
associated with the McKinlev administration will convey the body to Washing
ton.
BUFFALO, Sept. 14.â This has been a day of extreme sorrow In the Ex
position City. While the new President was actively preparing to
take up the reins of government arrangements were being made to
pay the last loving tributes to the memory of William McKinley.
The Cabinet after v conf erring] with the family of the late President
decided upon a state funeral at Washington. It waa at first intended
â¢ UFFALO. Sept. 14.â Theodore Roosevelt, -who to-day was tragically";
i* js elevated to the chief magistracy of the American republic by the
I |g^ death of President McKlnley, entered tills city of mourning this aft-"
aernoon after a remarkable and . perilous - Journey from the heart of a
*jt jy north woods. He had been President under the constitution and law
Â¦^^Â¦"^^ of the land since the minute the martyred President Â¦ ceased to live.
All the duties and powers of the office had devolved upon him, but
he was as powerless as the humblest citizen to exercise one of them until he had
eor~-jlied with the constitutional provision requiring him to take a prescribed
oath to support and defend the constitution and laws of the United States. He
took that oath at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon in the library of the residence of
Ansley Wilcox, a personal friend with whom he stopped earlier in the week
when the physicians thought President McKlnley would recover from the wound
Inflicted by the assassin.
There wiere present when he swore to the oath Secretaries Root, Hitchcock.
Long'. Wilsbn and Postmaster General Smith, Senator C. Si. Depew of New
York, Judge of the Court of Appeals Haight, John N. Scathaxd, Mr. and Mrs.
Ansley Wilcox, Miss Wilcox, George P. Sawyer, Drs. Mann, Parke and Stockton,
3Ir. and Mrs. Carleton Sprague, Mr. and Mrs. John G. Milburn; the Secretary to
tn* President. William Loeb Jr.; the secretary, to the deceased President,
George B. Cortelyou: Mr. and Mrs. Charles Carry, C. R. . Scathard, J.
D. Sawyer and William Jeffers. official telegrapher, in addition to Judge
John R. Hazel of the United States District Court, who administered the
oath. The scene was a most affecting one. The new President had just come
y from the Milburn house, where his predecessor lay cold In death. " -~
Overcome by Deep Personal Sorrow.
Overcome by the deep personal sorrow he felt in his characteristically Impul
sive way, he had gone first to the house of mourning to offer his condolence
and sympathy to the broken-hearted widow. Secretary Root, who twenty years
agro had been present at a similar scene when Arthur took the oath after the
death of another President who fell a victim to an assassin's bullet, almost broke
down when he requested Mr. Roosevelt on behalf of the members of the Cabinet
' of the late President to take the prescribed oath. There was not a dry eye In the
room. The new President was visibly shaken, but he controlled himself, and
when he lifted his hand to swear It was as steady as though carved in marble.
With the deep solemnity of the occasion full upon him, he announced to those
present that his aim would be William McKinley's successor In deed as well as
in name. Deliberately he proclaimed it In these words: , Â¦ â¢
"In this hour of deep and terrible national bereavement, I wish to
- state that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely without variance
the policy of President McKinley for the peace and prosperity and honor
of cur beloved country." â¢ i :
The far-reaching significance of this pledge to continue the policy of the dead
President, announced at the very threshold of a new governmental regime,
profoundly impressed his hearers, and President Roosevelt's first step after
taking the oath was in line with Its redemption. His first act was to ask the
members of the Cabinet to retain their portfolios in order to aid him to conduct
the Government on lines laid down by him whose policy he had declared hs
would uphold. Such an appeal was not to be resisted, and every member of the
Cabinet, including Secretary of State Hay and Secretary of the Treasury Gage,
who Â¦were communicated with 1 in Washington, have agreed for the present at
least to retain their several portfolios. The President has made no plans as
He said he was so shocked by the national calamity that had thrust new
T responsibilities upon him that he had had no time yet to think of his future ca
reer at Washington. He will remain here quietly to-morrow, and on Monday
will accompany the funeral train to the national capital.
New President's Arrival at Buffalo.
President Roosevelt reached Buffalo at 1:40 this afternoon, accompanied only
by his private secretary, William Loeb Jr. An immense crowd, which had been
awaiting his arrival for hours, was gathered about the station, eager to catch
a first sight of the President. The train, however, did not enter the station
proper, but the President landed a.t the terrace. "When he left the train an es
cort of the Fourth Signal Corps formed about him and conducted him to an auto
mobile which his friend Ansley Wilcox had In waiting.
The demonstration which greeted his appearance was in keeping with the sol
emnity of the occasion- Those who saw him did not raise a cheer,' but attested
their respect by lifting their hats. â¢ '
As soon as he entered the vehicle the chauffeur turned the lever and the auto
mobile went skimming away to the residence of Mr. Wilcox, on Delaware avenue.
Twenty mounted police clattering along on either 6lde could with difficulty keep
the pace which the automobile set. . â¢
President Roosevelt declined to make any statement whatever for publication.
"I was so shocked." said he. "by the terrible news brought to me last night
and by the calamity which It entailed upon the country, as well as by the per
sonal sorrow which I feel, that I have had no time to think of plans for the future
conduct of the office which has been so suddenly and sadly thrust upon me."
The President arrived at the Wilcox home at 1:45 o'clock, his only attendants
being William Loeb Jr. and Ansley Wllcox. With hardly any conversation he re
tired at once to his room, where he bathed and dressed. At 2:30 o'clock he was
ready to leave for the Milburn house/where he desired to make his official call of
condolence. He was escorted by a detail from the Fourth Signal Corps and mount
ed police. So rapidly did his driver proceed that his escort was left a, couple of
y blocks behind, with the exception of the commanding officer and a lieutenant of

The mob which made the attack on the

cried: V
"Let's march to the jail and lynch the

into Dearborn avenue from Michigan

Then Ryan, Mullins and Toban drew their
revolvers and commanded the men to
stop. \

be promptly executed. Promptness must be
emphasized, for when an assassin Is allowed
to go from court to court and gain the notoriety

Referring- to possible changes President
Roosevelt may make in his Cabinet, he

URGED SAX FRANCISCO LABOR COUNCIL TO BOYCOTT THE CALL
BECAUSE OF ITS POLICY OF PUBLISHING LEGITIMATE NEWS.
Bowlan is a native of England and has
lived in California since 1851. Of ignoble
birth and comparatively no education, he
found existence in the haunts of crime
more congenial to his depraved taste than
the pursuit of some honest occupation. In
1862 ne was arrested for petty larceny and
after conviction of the offense was sen
tenced to the County Jail for thirty days.
He was 18 years of age at this time, and
his appearance prior to his conviction is
depicted in the photograph made at the
time and reproduced herewith.
-Upon his reappearance after his term In
jail Bowlan lived lor some years in a pre
carious way. He married early in the
seventies, and from the iirst treated his
wife with bestial cruelty. In 1879 Mrs.
Bowlan, driven to despair by her shame
less husband's brutality, left him and
took up her residence at 520 Chestnut
street. On the night of June 16 of that
year. Bowlan went to his wife's room and
demanded that she return to him. On
her refusal to comply with his demand
he drew a pistol and shot her through the
heart. He was convicted of murder in the
second decree and sent> to San Quentin
for a term of twenty years. Bowlan was
for years a favored henchman of Chris
Buckley,' and . through the latter's in
fluence he was pardoned by . Governor
Stoneman on July 26, 1886, after serving
six years of his time. <*j.
This is a partial history of the wretch
whom the Examiner now employs, in the
furtherance of Its designs against reput
able journalism In San Francisco.- On
Shoots His Defenseless Wife.
SPURRED on by the Examiner In
its fight against decent journal
ism, James Bowlan, wife-mur
derer, ex-convict, petty thief, dis
graced politician, self-styled hack
man and protege of San Francisco's yel
low journal, has demanded that the La
bor Council declare a boycott against The
To the credit of the .members of the La
bor Council, in which body Bowlan repre
sents the Hackmen's Union, the resolu
tion declaring a boycott presented by
himself and M. C. Coftey. president of the
Hackmen's Union, without the knowledge
or consent of the members of that body,
was promptly laid on the table.
Bowlan is a fit example of the character
of tools employed by the Examiner when
It has need of men of hi3 ignoble stamp
to carry some nefarious issue to a suc
cessful conclusion. At the meeting of the
labpr convention last Tuesday, the man
agement of that journal prompted Bow
lan to submit a resolution expressing the
Joy of the convention at the prospect of
a speedy recovery of President McKinley.
The resolution contained a clause con
demning "shameful efforts to make po
litical _ capital out of the. sorrow and
agony ol a national calamity," . which was
printed in conspicuous type, and which
all who were aware of the Examiner's
threat of the previous day was a direct
insinuation against The Call. Unable to
make proper reply to The Call, the reso
lution mentioned was resorted to, and
Bowlan, a cowardly assassin, who wan
tonly slew his wife, and who narrowly
escaped the gallows for his dastardly
crime, was trie instrument employed in
bringing It forward.
That the action of Bowlan and Coffey
In seeking to boycott The Call is not sanc
tioned by the members of the Hackmen's
Union is evidenced by the following card
issued by members of that body last
night:
To -Whom It 'May Concern: '. We vigorously
protest against any attempt on the part of M
C. Coffey and James Bowlan to declare a boy
cott against The Call or any other paper. Their
action In trying to ha\*e a resolution Â¦ passed
condemning: the policy of The Call Is silly In
the extreme and was not countenanced by the
members of the. Hackmen's Union. We want
Bowlan is a disgrace to humanity. His
despicable character makes' him a shame
and a reproach to the community. He Is
a vagrant without visible means of liveli
hood, and that he should be connected
with any organization of labor, or should
represent any gathering of honest wage
earners in the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil, is an , unspeakable outrage. His pres
ence in any respectable assemblage pol
lutes it with his inlqultv and shameless
ness; and his dastardly record, which
ranges from larceny to murder, should
condemn him forevermore In the eyes of
alt who are unfortunate enough to know
him. It is a character such as this man
presents to shock honest men and women
that the Examiner embraces without
compunction when certain tasks are to be
performed. But Bowlan's effort to secure
a boycott against The Call has served
only to rake up the gaunt shadows of a
wretched past to confound and hold him
up to the scorn of the community in which
he has for years operated with . hands
stained by the blood of a defenseless wife
whom he foully murdered. Â¦ .
Hackmen Denounce Action.
July 29, 1S99, the Examiner denounced
his re-entrance into the political arena as
a disgrace to the community. Yet, after
two years, finding that the services of
this convicted assassin might perhaps
prove of value, the Examiner caused him
as a member of the San Francisco Labor
Council to present a resolution declaring
a boycott upon The Call. Acting without
the sanction of the body he represents in
the council, Bowlan, backed by President
Coffey, exposed himself to censure by his
fellow members, and it is now certain
that his usefulness as a member of the
Hackmen's Union will be deservedly
short-lived. . â¢ ,â¢
Morses Start East;
George E. Morse and wife, with Miss
Grace McKinley, started for the East last
evening to attend the funeral of the late
President. Mrs. Morse is a niece of the
President and Miss McKinley is a cousin.
Leonard Nott, formerly a policeman,
was arrested last night by Sergeants Dun
can and O'Connor and locked up. in the
tanks. To-day Captain Seymour expects
to be able to place several charges of rob
bery against him. Nott is a striking
teamster. Since the inaguration of the
strike, so the police say, he has taken
particular delight in abusing and beating
special policemen. Several of them have
made complaint. A few nights ago a spe
cial named Riley was unmercifully beaten
on Third street, near Howard, and robbed
of a few dollars and a watch. As one of
his assailants answered the - description
of Nott, Captain Seymour intends to have
Riley taken to the City Prison to-day for
the purpose of seeing whether or not he
can identify the ex-policeman. . r
Nott is an escape from, the House of
Correction. After being summarily dis
missed from the Police Department for
disgraceful conduct he- was arrested for
stealing two- barrels of whisky- from a
store on Front street.*"' He was convicted
of Â£he charge and sent to the House of
Correction for one year. After he had
served about half his sentence he man
aged to escape. -. ,
In case the -arresting offlers fall to find
sufficient evidence against Nott to con
vict him of beating and robbing specials
Captain Seymour intends to charge him
with jail-breaking. .
Special Officers Accuse
Him of Robbing
Them.

sentatives a wretch. who is unfit to asso
ciate with worthy men and whose proper
sphere is In the kennel,* to .which his con
temptible crimes Bhould condemn â¢ him. ~
Â¦ Â¦'-Â¦.Â¦-' ' - ,
? Bowlan admitted to a Call reporter yes
terday that he served time for the murder
of his wife, but he denies that he was
ever convicted of petty larceny. ; The
police records are clear on that point,
however, - and > his weak â¢ denial, unsup
ported v by aught save his ; own . perjured
testimony, Is absolutely valueless. Devoid
of the instincts of, a man and lost to all
sense of honor and decency, he grovels In
brutish I fear Â¦ of the consequences of his
act.:. Now that -the Labor Council mem-'
bers are aware of the character off- the
man with Â¦ whom they f raternize-^a being
who has the effrontery . to class : himself
among - the number of â¢ hones t â¢ men who
earn ; their subsistence â¢; by Â¦ honest " toil,'
their duty, is plain.
"The first knowledge we had of Bowlan
and Coffey's boycott resolution in the
Labor Council was when we read of it In
The Call. We were shocked. and amazed
at the outrageous character of the pro-,
ceeding. They had , no authority to pre
sent the resolution, the matter Â¦ navlng
never been advised by the union. â¢ At the
next : meeting of the union, Thursday
evening, the matter will be taken up and
there is no Question but the two : men
will be severely censured. We have no
fight against The Call or any other paper.
If we had time we could get every mem
ber of the union, except possibly -Bowlan
and Coffey, to . sign our protest. â¢ Their
action was -unwarranted- and will .- bo

1. The following order of. the Secretary of
War announces to the army the death of
President William McKinley:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â A dispatch
was received at the War Department
from Secretary Root approving the recent
order to the army announcing the death
of President McKinley. 1 It will be sent
to all officers In command to-morrow. The
order follows:
EX-POLICEMAN
IN THE TANKS
.LONDON, Sept. 14.â It is. learned that
King Edward is considering the j advisa
bility of the Duke of Cornwall and York
attending the funeral of President Mc-
Kinley. The uncertainty which exists
here. as to the date of the ceremonv and
the lack of knowledge of the attitude of
President Roosevelt and others toward
such a visit have prevented anything
definite being decided upon. The Foreign
Office heartily indorses the suggestion,
subject to the approval of the United
States Cabinet and the consent of King
Edward, who under the circumstances, is
obviously the most concerned. -
It is said that if it is decided to be ad
visable for the Duke of York to attend
the funeral, the Canadians will doubtless
gladly put up with the disarrangement of
their programme consequent upon such a
momentous diversion of the royal tour. /
As regards thi3 suggestion and other of
ficial details connected with Great Brit
ain's effort to honor the dead President
great uncertainty prevails,' owing to the
Marquis of Lansdowne, the Foreign Min
ister, being in a sequestered spot in Ire
land, King Edward being in Denmark
and the Cabinet being scattered, over the
United Kingdom. . ,
The Sunday Special, presenting the ques
tion of attendance of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York at the
funeral of President McKinley, says: ,
"In view of the deep concern the King
has manifested from the moment the
President was shot there can be no doubt
that the attendance of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York would be
received with warm gratitude by the
United States, and despite questions of
etiquette the King may well feel that such
an onportunity of strengthening the good
relations of the two great English-speak
ing peoples should not lightly 'be put
aside."

Rests With Counsel
for Schley.
WASHINGTON, Sept 14.-Admiral
Dewey came to the city to-day from his
country home and consulted with Captain
Lemly, the judge advocate of the Schley
court .of inquiry, respecting- the effect of
the President's death upon the court's
proceedings. "While no announcement has
yet been made, it is expected the court
will meet on Monday at the navy yard,
in accordance with the call issued by Ad
miral Dewey, and that it will adjourn
until the day immediately after the
funeral of President McKinley, as a mark
of respect to' his memory. .
Counsel for Rear Admiral Schley ex
press themselves as satisfied with Rear
Admiral Ramsay as a member of th9
court in place of Rear Admiral Howlson.
No summons has been issued by Judga
Advocate Lemly for Rear Admiral Samp
son, and unless something unforeseen oc
cur later in the case he will not call Ad
miral-Sampson to Washington. on his own
initiative. Captain Lemly has issued very
few summonses so far and some of these
already issued have been withdrawn, and
in addition he does not regard the testi
mony of Admiral Sampson as necessary
in this case. If Admiral Schley's counsel,
however, care to call Admiral Sampson
the judge advocate will issue the sum
mons and his physical and mental condi
tion will determine the character of his
response.
ACTOR FIGURES
IN REAL DRAMA
W. H. Thompson Arrest
ed at Doors of Colum
bia Theater.
W. H. Thompson, the well-known char
acter actor, who has been playing with
the Frohman Company at the Columbia
Theater, was arrested last night by a
Deputy Sheriff on an order issued by Su
perior Judge Graham. ~ ;
Thompson's arregt was on complaint of
Mrs. John H. Greer of this city, who al
leged that Thompson was about to leave
the State in order to avoid payment of a
judgment she had secured against him in
Superior Judge Hunt's court.
Thompson was formerly married to a
daughter of Mrs. Greer, but some years
agx> he . secured a divorce. His ex-wif e
died after the divorce and Mrs. Greer
brought suit in the Superior Court to re
cover $1050, which she claims she advanced
to Thompson and' his wife.
Thompson stated last night that he
knew nothing whatever of any money ever
having been .advanced to him or. his wife
by Mrs. Greer and that he was in entire
ignorance of any suit against him. He
denied that he had ever been served with
any - papers in the case. Judge Graham
made an order that Thompson could only
secure his release from custody by putting
up $500 bail. As Thompson could not fur
nish the amount the Deputy Sheriff re
mained with him at his hotel. The case
will be heard to-morrow morning by Su
perior Judge Graham. .
Croker Speaks of Calamity.
NEW YORK. Sept 14.â Richard Croker
was a passenger on the steamer Lucania,
which arrived here from Liverpool to-day.
He .would not discuss politics.
"When the whole American nation is
filled with sorrow at the untimely death
of our chief magistrate it is no time to
talk politics," he said. "Under the great
affliction that has befallen us, "Democrats
and Republicans stand side by side as
American citizens with uncovered heads,
shocked and grief-stricken, at the bier
of our dead President." " "

SAN JOSE, Sept. 14.â The Republican
Good Government League this afternoon
eulogized the martyred President and
adopted resolutions condemning the as
assination and extending sympathy to
Mrs. McKinley. President E. A. Hayes
presided, and there was a large attend
ance. The meeting had been called for a
reorganization of the league, but the
death of Mr. McKinley turned it into one
of sorrow and grief. President Hayes de
livered an eloquent address. He said that
three times within bis memory the coun
try had been called to mourn the loss of
a "beloved chiefâ Lincoln, Garfield and
McKinley. All were good and great men
and their administrations had greatly
benefited the country- Judge J. R. Lewis
followed In an address that was touching.
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
Wbereas. For the third time ln the life of
our nation the assassin's bullet has robbed the
people of Its beloved President, thereby throw
injp- the entire American continent into deep
mournlr.F and threatening the very founda
tions of oar political existence: therefore, be it
Rreolved. By the Republican Good Govern
ment League of Santa Clara County that in
the death Â©*-the Honorable William McKlnley
the people of the United Etatcs have lost an
efficient executi\'e officer, a man. of the high
est type in every sense of the word, a true
patriot, an honest and upright citizen, and a
man who la every way stood for what ls best
in American citizenship. Â¦
That we heartily sympathize with his be
reaved wife in her terrible affliction.
That we believe that euch amendments to
cur laws, and if necefcsary to the constitution,
must be made as will prohibit the promul-
Kation of principles which teach and encour
age assassination in high places, and as will
make it possible to stamp out the evil of an
axchism forever.
The meeting then adjourned out of re
spect to the dead President
Mayor Martin to-day issued the follow
ing proclamation to the citizens of San
Jose:
Office of the Mayor t
cf the City of gan Jose. $
To the citizens of the city of San Jose: To
day the entire civilized world mourns the loss
of America's greatest citizen, our martyred
President. William McKlnley, struck down by
the hand of a dastardly assassin at the . mo
ment when his many virtues had most endeared
him to the hearts of his people. It is a time
of sorrow, of deepest grief, . and every indi
vidual of this commonwealth feels the loss as
a personal bereavement.
Under such circumstances, it is due the rev
erence and love the American people bear for
the achievements and character of our honored
dead, and a proper expression of the affection
bo freely bestowed upon him that the munici
pality and all its citizens, by united action,
give public evidence of their grave and irre
parable Ioee and deep and lasting grief.
Knowing the patriotic sentiments of the citi
zens of this community, I therefore direct that
the flags upon all public buildings in the city
of San Joee be placed at half stall for a period
of thirty days, and that -on the day of the
funeral of William McKinley the offices of the
municipality be closed. I would further earn
estly request that all business houses remain
closed on the day of the funeral as a mark
of respect for the nation's dead.
Dated this 14th day of November, 1901.
C. J. martin,
Mayor of the City of San Jose.

of the Republic, that we learn with lnexpress
able indignation of the fiendish and dastardly
assault on the person of our beloved comrade
and honored Presidents William McKlnley at
the city of Buffalo, New York, by one who
has no honor or principle, and totally unworthy
of recognition as a fit person to live in this
or any other country, but should be dispatched
to his eternal doom of hell fire and brimstone,
with alL who entertain such views. We there
fore demand that the pernicious and hellish
doctrine of the clan of anarchists should be
speedily suppressed by an act of Congress
leading to that end, and we further believe
that there should be laws passed to put down
all of the dastardly yellow journals-^to wine
them out of the United States. â¢
Done by order, of the post.

NAMES A DAY FOR MOURHIRC-
Will Forward Resolutions.
Spartan and Harmony lodges of the An
cient Order of United Workmen adjourned
last night out of respect to the memory
of the late President McKinley.
At the meeting of Mission Chapter of
the Order of the Eastern Star, at which,
there were present nearly 200 members ot
the order. It waa resolved to send a letter
of condolence to Mrs. McKlnley, who la a
member of the order.
At an' early session of the Board of Kire
Underwriters and the Marine Underwrit
ers of San Francisco yesterday it was de
cided to at once close their offices for the
day out of respect to the memory of the
late President McKinley. It was further
decided that the insurance offices of the
members will be closed on the day of the
funeral.
Insurance Offices Close.
Let us bow reverently before the remains of
this victim and let us ehed our tears over his
open grave! During McKinley's visit to this
city, a. representative of l'ltalia -was intro
duced to him. While presenting to the Chief
Magistrate of this country of adoption the
greetings of thousands of fellow Italians, Mc-
Kinley, shaking hands, cheerfully said he con
sidered the Italians as among the most loyal
of foreign American citizens. Let us, there
fore. In this- day of bereavement, send our
reverent salute to the generous American
country, and let us mourn with the nation.
The man - who loved his country so fondly,
who fought his country's wars on the battle
fields and in the legislative halls; the man
who with an overwhelming majority was
twice elected by his people to the highest office
of^ the nation, and to his nation he gave a
prosperity never before enjoyed, this noble
man, William McKlnley, died tragically, vic
tim of an anarchistic hand, the only hand that
could be raised against the Chief Magistrate
of the nation, the most prosperous and happy
land on earth. r' â¢
Just as a year ago Brescl killed the kindest
of kings, so now. by the hand of assassin
Czolgosz. ebbed away the life of the most popu
lar of Presidents. ,.
Infamous anarchy has made another victim,
and this time it has torn the life, of the most
democratic, of the most popular among the
chiefs of nations, a man elected by the people,
by the vote of seventy millions of free citizens,
the freest .of. the world.
The noble American nation ls ln mourning;
the whole civilized world ls ln mourning!
The following ls a translation of an edi
torial which appeared ln L'ltalia, the
Italian daily of this city:

Sorrow.

OP PRESIDENT McKINLEY
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 14.â Great sym
pathy -was expressed in Victoria for the
people of the United States in their
affliction. When It was known that the
cowardly deed of the assassin had robbeu
the nation of its President many messages
of sympathy were sent to the United
States Consul. The church and fire belli*
were tolled and Victoria to-day was like*
a forest of half-masted flags. In many
places pictures of the dead President were
displayed, bordered with crape.
One of the. most noticeable marks of
sympathy was the Stars and Stripes flying
at half-mast on the British warship War
spite, flagship of the fleet, that mark of
respect being paid at the orders of the
admiral.
The following message of sympathy was
sent to the United States Consul by Pre
mier Dunsmuir on behalf of the Govern
ment of British Columbia:
PREMIER'S OFFICE. VICTORIA.
Sept. 14, 19G1.
Hon. Abraham Smith, Consul of the United
States, Victoria, B. Câ Sir: I have the honor,
by direction, to convey to you an expression
of the deep regret which is felt by Hon. James
Dunsmuir and the members of the executive
on account of the sad termination of the mur
derous attempt on the life of the late Hon.
William McKlnley, President of the United
States, and to say on their behalf, more es
pecially in view of the unspeakable means by
which his life was sacrificed, how sincerely
they sympathize with the people of your coun
try In the great Ios3 you have sustained. To
his bereaved -widow and the other members
of the late President's family, the executive
desire in particular to extend their condolence.
The sympathies and sentiments of our people
are, as you may see, everywhere publicly and
strikingly Indicated and there is not the slight
est doubt that a common bond of feeling with
people akin is being similarly manifested to
day throughout our Dominion and the entire
British empire. I have the honor to be, sir,
your most obedient servant.
R. K. GOSNELU Private Secretary.
Mayor Hayward forwarded the follow
ing dispatch to his Excellency, the Gov
ernor-General, for transmission to Wash
ington: y
Citizens of Victoria. B. C, deeply moved by
the loss our brethren of the United States
have sustained by the removal of their re
vered President, desire to tender sincere sym
pathy in this hour of their national bereave
ment. CHARLES HAYWAHD. Mayor.
Hon. Abraham Smith, United States
Consul, was the recipient of many ex
preÂ«Htons of condolence from citizens of
all Classen, which were collectively trans
mitted by him to his Government.
NANAIMO, B. C, Sept. 14,â All flags
are half-masted here and were Nanalmo
on United States soil no more Brief for
tho martyred President could be din
played. Mayor Manson, voicing the senti
ments of all, said this evening:
"Nanaimo shares the sorrow of the
United States and extends full measure
of sympathy to the bereaved wife of the
dead Frcsldent." >
OAKLAND, Sept: 14.â In accordance
with the request of Mayor Barstow, the
committee which had charge of the re
ception to President McKinley during his
visit to Oakland met to-day to arrange
for a public memorial service in honor. pf
the dead. John A. Britton and P.- E.
Bowles held a conference with Congress
man Victor H. Metcalf touching the form
of the exercises, ln general it was de
cided to hold a military, civic and school
children's parade, with simultaneous ser
vices following in the principal churches
of the city. Tnis plan was conceived upon
the belief that a late day might be se
lected for general observance throughout
the United States.
The announcement that Tuesday had
been selected as the day for the funeral,
the proclamation issued by the Governor
for a public observance of that day and
the tendency manifested, to make the day
of the funeral the special time for a pub
lic mourning, led the committee to defer
final decision until to-morrow. There will
be a meeting to-morrow morning of the
committee and some other prominent citi
zens to arrange the programme.
Public buildings, private houses and
business places throughout the city are
rapidly being draped ln the colors -of
mourning. The flag is at half mast every
where.

Committee That Received
President to Arrange
Memorial Exercises.
j It was 3:15 p. m. when' President Roose
velt' came back to the house j of Ansley
Wilcox, and until 3:25 p. m., when the
Cabinet arrived, preparations were being
made for the taking of the oath of office.
Â¦ The place selected was the library of
Mr. Wilcox's house, a rather small' room,
the picturesque, heavy oak trimmings and
massive bookcases giving it somewhat the
appearance of a legal den.
President Takes Position.
A pretty bay window with stained glass
and . pretty hangings formed a back
ground; and'before this the President took
his position. Surrounding : him were the
five members of the Cabinetâ Secretaries
Root,. Hitchcock, uong and Wilson and
Postmaster General Smith. Near by were
Senator Chauncey M. Depew. Judge ot
the Court of Appeals Haight, John Scath
erd, Mr. and Mrs. Ansley Wilcox, Miss
Wilcox, George H: Sawyer, Drs. Mann,
Parke and Stockton; Mr. and Mrs. Carlton
Sprague, Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Milburn,
Secretary to the President William Loeb
Jr., Secretary to the deceased President
George B. Cortelyou, Dr. and Mrs. Charles
Carey, R. C. Scatherd, J. D. Sawyer, Wil
liam Jeffers of the United States Senate
and Judge of the United States District
Court John R. Hazel. , , ,
Judge Hazel stood near the President In
the bay window, and the latter showed ma
almost extreme nervousness by plucking
at the lapel of his long frock coat and
nervously tapping the hardwood floor with
his heel. He stepped over once to Secre
tary Root and for about five minutes they
conversed earnestly. The question at is
sue was whether the President should first
sign an oath of office and then swear ln
or whether he should swear first and sign
the document in the case after.
Secretary Boot "Weeps.
' At precisely 3:32 Secretary of War Root
Bald In an almost inaudible voice:
"Mr. Vice President: I here his
voice broke down for fully two minutes,
the tears came down his face and his lips
quivered so that he could not continue
his utterances. There were sympathetic
tears from those about him, and two great
drops ran down either cheek of the suc
cessor of William McKlnley. Mr. Roots
chin was on his breast. Suddenly, throw
ing back his head as If with an effort,
he continued in a broken voice: -
"1 have been requested, on behalf or
the Cabinet, of the late President, at
least those who are present in Buffalo,
all except two. to request lor reasons of
weight, affecting the affairs of govern
ment, you should proceed to take the
constitutional oath of ofllce as President
of the United States."
Judge Hazel had stepped to the rear of
the President and Mr., Roosevelt, coming
closer to Secretary Root, said in a voice
that at first wavered, but finally came
deep and strong, while, as if to control
his nervousness, he held firmly to the
lapel of hid coat with his right hand:
"I shall take the oath at once, in ac
cordance with your request, and in this
hour of deep and terriblo bereavement I
wish to state that it shall bo my aim. to
contlnuo absolutely unbroken' the policy
of President McKinley for the peace and
prosperity and honor of our beloved coun
try " r
Roosevelt Takes the Oath.
Tho President stepped farther Into the
bay window and Judge Hazel, taking up
the constitutional oath of the President,
which had been prepared on parchment,
asked the President to raise his right
hand and repeat It after him. There was
a hush like death in tho room as the
Judge read a few words at a timo and the
President ln a strong voice, without a
tremor and with his hand raised as steady
as If carved from marble, repeated It aft-Â»
er him.
"And thus I swear," ho ended it.
The hand dropped by his side, his chin
for an instant rested on. the breast and
the ' silence remained' unbroken for a
couple of minutes, as', though the new
President of the United States was offer-
Ing silent_prayer.^ Judge Hazel broke it,
saying: u ' r'"-'-'*'" > Â¦'Â¦: ?'Â¦' ~"; " '
"Mr. President," please attach your sig
nature." . - .'
Then the -President; turning to a small
table near by. wrote "Theodore Roose
velt" at the bottom of the document in a
firm hand. ' - '
"I should like to see the members of the
Cabinet a. few moments after the others
retire," said the President, and this was
the signal for the score of people who had
been favored by witnessing the ceremony
t6 leave. As they turned to go the Presi
dent said: "I will shake hands with you
people gladly." and with something of his
old smile returning he first shook hands
with the members of the Cabinet present
and finally with a few guests and news
paper men.
Cabinet Members Remain.
Immediately following the dispersing of
the epectators after the taking of the
oath the President asked the Cabinet
members present to confer with him. The
conference lasted nearly two hours, and
when It was finished the President said
to the' Associated Press reporter:
Following, on the brief statement I v made
when taking the oath that I would follow the
administrative lines laid down by President
McKlnley, I requested the members of the
Cabinet, who were present to remain in their
positions, at least for the 'present. They ; have
assured, me that they will and I may say that
I have assurance also from the absent mem
bers. - .
Inquiry was made of the President as to
whether an extra session of Congress
would be called by him, and he said that
there was no fundamental law requiring
the calling of Congress together on the
succession of the Vice President to the
Presidency and that after consultation
with the Cabinet they had decided that no
such extra session would be called. The
President, after, the meeting of the Cabi
net, saw a few personal friends and then,
putting on his hat, said to Secretary
Root:
"Let us take a little walk; It will do us
both good."
Secretary Root assented and they
walked on the porch. His host, Ansley
Wilcox, said: ...
"Mr. President, shall I go along with
you?"
The President said: "No, I am going to
take a short walk up the street with Sec
retary Root and will return again."
Befuses to Be Guarded.
When he got down to the front walk a
couple of police and a couple of detectives
in citizens' clothes started to follow him.
He. turned and told the Secretary to tell
them that he did not desire any protec
tion.
, "I. do not want to establish the prece
dent of going about guarded," he said.
The policemen and detectives^ touched
.their hats, but before he had gone a hun
dred yards two ot them were_walklng ju^t
behind him and two of them were follow
ing him on the other side of the street.
The two distinguished men attracted
little attention until they got near the
police lines on Delaware avenue, when,
as the President stopped to shake hands
and say good by to Secretary Root,
some of the crowd recognized him and
he was surrounded. The police drove the
crowd back and the President walked
briskly back to the Wilcox mansion.
He announced that he would not leave
the city until Monday morning, when the
funeral train is to leave.
The President passed the evening quiet
ly at Mr.- Wllcox's home, dining quite
late. Governor B. B. Odell of New Tork
and Congressman Lucius LIttaur of New
>York called during the evening, as did
.'also Russell B. Harrison. The President,
while affable, showed some effects of -the
long. Journey and to-day's strain. How
ever, he found time, to have a chat with
Governor Odell.

sages; of congratulation to-night;- in fact,

Wednesday afternoon. The funeral train
is expected to reach Canton at 11 o clocK
Thursday morning, where the final ser
vices will be committed to the charge of
the citizens of Canton, under the direc
tion of a committee to be selected by the
Mayor of the city.
Secretary Hay's official announcement
of the ceremonies ls the same as the
foregoing, with the additional statement:
"No ceremonies are expected in tne
cities and towns along the route of the
funeral train beyond the tolling of bells.
* Boosevelt's Proclamation.
Â¦President Roosevelt to-night Issued the
following proclamation:
By the President of the United Statesâ A
Proclamation: ~
A terrible bereavement has befallen our peo
ple. ThÂ« President of the United States has
been struck down; a crime committed not only
against the chief magistrate but against every
law-abiding and liberty loving citizen.
President McKlnley crowned a life ot largest
love for his fellow men. ot most earnest en
deavor for their welfare, by a death of Chris
tian fortitude, and both the way in which he
devoted his life and the way In which, ln the
supreme hour ot trial, he met his death, will
remain forever a precious heritage ot our
people.
It la meet that we. as a nation, express our
abiding love and reverence for his life, our
deep sorrow for his untimely death.
Now. therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt. Presi
dent of the United States of America, do ap
point Thursday next. September 19. A. D. 1901,
the day on which the body of the dead Presi
dent will be laid ln its last earthly resting
place, as a day of mourning and prayer
throughout the United States. I earnestly rec
ommend that all the people do assemble on that
day ln their respective places of divine worship,
there to bow down In submission to the will ot
Almighty God and to pay out of full hearts
their homage of love and reverence to the great
Rnd good President, whose death has smitten
the nation with bitter grief.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the seal ot the United States
to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington, thÂ« 14th day
of September, A. D. one thousand nine hundred
and one, and of the independence ot the United
States the one hundred and twenty-sixth.
[Seal.] THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
By the President.
JOHN HAY. Secretary of State.
Beyond Surgical Skill.
The following report of the autopsy
upon the remains of President McKlnley
was Issued at 5 o'clock: '
The bullet which struck over the breastbone
did not pass through the akin and did little
harm. The other bullet passed both walls of
the stomach near Its lower border. Both holes
wÂ«re found to be perfectly closed by the
stitches, but the tissue around each bole ha.i
become gangreneou*. After passing through
the stomach the bullet passed Into the back
walla of the abdomen, hitting and tearing the
upper end of the kidney. This portion of thÂ«
bullet's track was also gangreneous, the gan
grene Involving the pancreas. The bullet ha*
not yet been found. There was no sign of
peritonitis or disease of other organs. ThÂ«
heart walla were very thin. 'Che re wat no tfvl'
dence of any attempt at repair on thÂ« part of
nature, and death resulted from the ganxren*
which affected the stomach around the bullet
wounds as well as the tissues around the fur
ther course of the bullet. Death was un
avoidable by any surgical or medical treat,
ment, and was ths direct result of th*
bullet wound.

favorably Inclined to C street, as It offers

Mayor stated that he had received numer

to the strike the board was obliged to hire
teams to haul the refuse away.- It "was
almost impossible to secure a sufficient
number of teams. Only twelve have been
pressed into service and thirty-five are
necessary. The Mayor was satisfied with
the explanation, but suggested that extra
ordinary efforts Â¦ be made to insure the
proper cleaning of the streets.

On Wednesday tho child died, and since
then Guilford has tried all means in hiÂ«

would* have Â¦ been ' reduced to starvation
last night, the only money in their pos

"Give me a chance to go to work," said
Guilford yesterday; "that is all I ask; but
the intimidations and annoyances to
which I. and, my familv have been sub
jected since ;I took that 'scab' Job havÂ©
been enough almost to break the spirit of
any man. I and my family must live, and
I am willing to work at anything. All I
want is the chance." â
Guilford claims that the strikers learned
that he was indebted to his landlady, Mrs.
Maria Kendall, for .a couple of weeks'
rent. Mrs. Kendall; Guilford says, went
to his house last Saturday afternoon, and
while the baby, five months old, was lying
in bed suffering from a fever threw their
belongings into the street. Mrs. , Kendall
also caused Guilford's arrest on charges
of threats against, life. . The case will
come up, for hearing before Judge Ca
baniss on Tuesday.
Guilford is a . sole leather cutter, . but
has been unable to obtain steady employ
ment at his trade. When the teamsters
went on strike Guilford went to work for
Drayman Leitch and earned $24. His foot

to Work.
Strikers Will Not *Allow the Father
While the sentiment among the team
sters ia growing that a settlement of the
strike should speedily be accomplished, It
Is hardly likely that any decided break
will be made to-morrow as was expected.
This is due to two facts. First, that the
teamsters who desire to go back to work
lack suitable leadership, and second, that
individual teamsters fear violence at the
hands of the strikers should they return
to work except in considerable force.
Thus far nearly 100 have signified their
willingness to desert the union cause, and
when a score or two more, they say, have
been secured the break will posltvely be
wade. . i~ â¢
Manager George Renner of the Dray
men's Association said yesterday that the
eituation remained unchanged. He said:
"I do not look for a vital change until
the end of next week. The teamsters,
who have been out of employment two
months to-day, are becoming very restive
and many would return to work Monday
were it not for the fear "of being maimed
or killed. The teamsters who are desir
ous of working need a leader. If they
were properly represented the strike
would eoon be broken. The men are
afraid to desert the union's cause singly,
as that would make them marked men,
and therefore subject to attack at any
time. I have reason to know that there
is srreat suffering " among the strikers'
'.There were few developments of interest
in the teamsters' strike yesterday. Sev
eral caucuses of dissatisfied teamsters
were held during the day, and the best
methods of bringing the strike to an end
were discussed. The pickets were out in
force, and their presence had the effect
of preventing arrangements for the con
templated break on Monday being con
cluded.

will insure British subjects immunity
from attack in this port.
Considerable Interest Is being taken In
this appeal to the Consul, and the skip
pers of British ships in the port all com
mend Capttin Pritchard's action. Realiz
ing the comparative inability of the mu
nicipal authorities to provide adequate
r>i flection they all look to their Consul to
r.ce to it that protection is forthcoming 1
from some Quarter.
The strike leaders assert that there la
no basis for the rumors of ,a proposed
break in the ranks. Michael Casey says
there will be no break, and that none of
the teamsters will return until the trouble
is settled on a basis of recognition of the
unions. '. .
families, and that It needs very little more
to cause a decided break."
Inquiry among the leading draymen yes
terday, developed the Information that the
situation was more hopeful than for sev
eral weeks past. â¢ The Impression prevails
th-dt notwithstanding the assertions of the
strike leaders as to the faithfulness of
the men, the crisis Is fast approaching,
and that the end of the struggle is now
in steht. .
The crew of the Haddon Hall is an ex
exceptional one in that not a sailor has
deserted the Bhlp ein.ee she reached port,
ami that most of them have been witn
Captain Pritchard for a number of years.
The boatswain has served on the ship
over eighteen years, the second mate and
steward over eight years, and the carpen
ter and three of the seamen over five
years.
Under these circumstances Captain
Pritchard takes a peculiar interest in his
official family and is greatly worried at
the possible prospect of ill happening to
sjjy of them.
That the crew Is deserving of the pride
the skipper takes in them is evidenced by
the fact that in spite of strikers' attacks i
and threats the cargo is being discharged |
just as rapidly as it could be with regular
stevedore assistance. From eighty to
ninety ton? is being taken out every day.
and this is about the limit of cargo that
could be worked over the vessel's present
berth In that period under any circum
stances.
The officers of the City Front Federa
tion seem to realize that in interfering
with British sailor? the strikers have I
made a serious mistake. They now offer
Captain Pritchard what is virtually a
passport to secure his men immunity
from attack.
"Whenever you want to send a man
up town." they inform him, "send us
word and we will send down a guard who
will see that he makes the trip without
being beaten or robbed."
Captain Pritchard and the Haddon Hall
have been picked out for special attention
at the hands of the union on account of
the skipper's activity in getting rid of his
cargo in spite of the strike.
The captain of the British ship Glenes
slin is a brother of Captain Pritchard.
Both vessels arrived about the same time
and both captains found themselves In the
tame flx on account of the strike. Both
â vessels are owned by the same firm, and
Â¦when it came to discharging the Glen
esslin the brothers Joined forces and got
through with the work just as though
no strike existed.
Consul Demands Protection.
That the working of the Haddon Hall
has gone along so smoothly is due to the
fact that Howard-street wharf, where she
1% discharging, is strongly policed. It is
not a closed dock, however, and the union
pickets on duty at respectful distance
from the police sentries have ample op
portunity of observing the sailors who are
discharging the cargo.
Lindsay, the man attacked on Friday.
!s conspicuous on account of his color and
his build. He was recognized by his as
tailants as one of the Haddon Hall crew.
He was told when struck that the attack
wat the consequence of his connection
with that vessel and of his working cargo.
British Vice Consul Moore will take â¢
prompt steps on behalf of his country
men. Immediately after receiving Cap
tain Prltchard'a report ha addressed a
communication to Chief of Police Sulll- ,
van, acquainting him with the facts and
demanding proper protection on the
streets and wharves of the port for citi
zens of Great Britain.
If the municipal authorities are unable
to furnish this protection Consul Moore
will through his Government request the
Federal authorities to take such steps as
A-n Exceptional Cre-w.
"Our flag entitles us to protection In an
American port, and I have requested the
British Consul to see that neither officers
nor men belonging to the Haddon Hall
are interfered with either while perform
ing their duty or while on the streets of
the city."
"1 am not looking for trouble." said
Captain Pritchard yesterday. "I have
nothing whatever to do with this strike.
I was not here when It started. I have
no power to stop it. In discharging my
ship I am only doing my duty to my own
ers: in working the cargo my men are
obeying my orders and carrying out the
conditions of the articles of their ser
vice.
Since the attack of Friday afternoon on
Able Seaman Charles Lindsay, officials
of the Sailors' Union have visited Captain
Pritchard and offered to provide him with
union gnards for such of his men as
found occasion to travel the streets oÂ£ the
cltv. This official confirmation of the
danger of attack helped to make Captain
Pritchard realize the seriousness of the
situation and prompted him to lay the
matter officially before his country's rep
resentative.
Csptala Pritchard of the ship Haddon
Hall yesterday made an official appeal
to British Vice Consul Wellesley Moore
for protection for his crew from violence
upon the streets of San Francisco. He
in'ormed the representative of the Brit
ish Government that some of his sailors,
all of whom axe British subjects, had
been "violently assaulted while peacefully
walking the streets of this port; that he
himself, his officers and others of the
crew had been -warned of slmllaj- Inten
tions toward themselves; that the assault
complained of had taken place in spita of
the protection provided by the municipal
authorities, and that he iras compelled
in view of the personal responsibility he
felt for the welfare and 6afety of his
crew to demand the protection to which

PERSONAL MENTION.
ONE of the features of the situation following theÂ»assassination of President McKinley
that merits more than a passing attention on the part of the public is the success with
which the banks of New York stopped a tendency toward a panic in Wall/ street and
thus prevented a disturbance of the business of the country that might have proven
very serious.
The act of assassination was committed too lateÂ«in the afternoon for the news, to affect
Wall street on that day, but next morning the feeling was decidedly panicky. The banks, how
ever, prepared to meet the emergency and to furnish money needed to sustain the market. As
soon as the news of the shooting was received the Clearing-House Committee was called together
and arrangements made for protecting all the associated banks in whatever should happen next
day. The manager of the Clearing- House is reported, to have said: "While- we deeply â¢"grieve
over whatyhas befallen President McKinley, our duty is to look ahead, and. if we do not stand
together {o preserve the stability of affairs it -would only aggravate the calamity/'
The decision on the part of the bankers was made known to the public and accordingly
the day following the shooting* was marked by nothing that showed _ any lack of 'confidence in
the continued stability of the prosperity of the business world. Last ..Friday morning, however,
when the people awoke to read that the President had a relapse during the night and was surely
dying, there was a feverish time in Wall street. The bankers had not expected it and were taken
unawares. Many of the leading bank officials were out of town. Within the first hour of the ses
sion of, the : Stock Exchange nearly 600,000 shares of stock were traded in, and at one time it is
said'mdney rose as high as 9 per cent, 'Then came the announcement that the agreement made
on the day following the assassination still held and the banks would 1 stand together, and at once
the feeling of confidence wa? restored. The. banks had saved Wall street and prevented a panic.
In these days, when attacks upon banks and bankers are so frequent, it, is just as well for
the public to take note of this, action and give honor where, it is due. '
A PANIC CHECKED.
QUO VADIS 1 ' at the Grand Op
era-house this lasc week has
brought to light two useful
players In the. new stock com
panyâMiss Laura Nelson Hall
and Herschel Ma'yall, leading -lady and
leading man. Miss Hall has ' been
playing Lydgia to . . â¢ Mr. Haworth's
Vinicius and has won pleasing rec
ognition ' for herself in the role, 'xne
new leading lady is quite young, even
better looking than the accompanying
picture, and is simple, graceful, sympa
thetic and sincere in her methods. Her
Lydgia was marked by a refreshing spon
taneity and refinement, and it is to be
hoped th'at the illness that has prevented
her from playing the part for the last
few days may be of short duration. Miss
Florence Stone .is kindly taking Miss
Hall's place during her illness.
The new leading man, Mr. May all, j is
also well equipped physically for his -posi
tion, having a voice, that thrills and a
handsome presence of. the classic type. If
he would but rid himself of a few Mad-
Dowelltries that he has acquired, or was
born withâ and that are probably cheerful
beliars of his real personalityâ a certain
little air of self-satisfaction, for example,
one could begin to look for the work that
counts from Mr. Mayall. Meantime he is
a useful and intelligent actor and, with
Miss Hall, stands out in high relief from
the rest of the company as they have so
far dawned upon us. This we ek we look
forward to Mr. Haworth's "Richelieu,"
and pray for further developments in his
support.

Ibsen is dying! So says Eugene Lime
dorfer in a profoundly Interesting little
article on the Norwegian urarnatist that
appears In the current number of the
Theater. Before the end of the year, for
it is a lingering death that fate holds for
the great little old man, Ibsen 'will have
gone the way of all things mortal and
the stage will have lost its most vital fig
ure of the day.
Mr. Limedorfer's sketch has a valuable
personal flavor Â¦ and he gives many char
acteristic anecdotes of the famous dra
matist, among them the following:
"To*some it will mean much, to others
'nothing," says Mr. Limedorfer; "it all de
pends on the point of view from which
one has regarded him. As the. master
dramatist of- his time, who has conquered
In spite of the usual persecutions that
beset genius, he must be regarded as of
the great ones of the earth a^ld Is so re
garded by a large following. As a social
reformer he. has again a large contingent
of admirers, and as "a man he has the
strong friends that men of reforming gen
ius usually count against their army of
orthodox enemies." - .' : i^
"Ibsen is at times gentleness Itself. , At
such times he is meek and seemingly as
submissive as Tolstoy would want us all
to be. But a strong individuality like his,
an assertive nature ' like the one Ibsen
possesses, must needs break out. At heart
he is an aristocrat, hay, even a tyrant.
He has great contempt for the crowd,
and in spite of the fact that he has fought
for the rights of the common' people he
really does not think that they are fit for
liberty. Upon his return from his-^rip to
Russia, where : he was entertained r and
made very much of, Ibsen gave some of
his impressions of the Czar's country. He
said: 'Russia Is the greatest country on
the earth. Â¦ The ' cry of "despotism" i3
raised only by a herd of stupid, ignorant
persons. As a matter of fact, Russian
literature is the result of despotism. The
great Russian writers owe their inspira
tions to despotism. "Why, rltissia is the
only country twhere people still prize lib-,
erty. None but the Russians are willing
to lay down their lives. for liberty. And
it is despotism which taught them that
lesson.'
"To say that his listeners were amazed
Is to put it mildly. After a while one
found words to sayr "Then you. believe
the Russians ought to be thankful' for
the despotism they live under. Perhaps
so. But it seems to me that one of their
institutions is a mighty, unpleasant one.

THE curtain has rung up on the con
cert season of 1901-02, its first event
being the very pleasing song recital
given on Tuesday evening last by
Miss Grace Carroll at Sherman &
Clay Hail. It was Miss Carroll's
first appearance here after her two years'
study in Eastern schools, and fully dem
onstrated her possession of one of the
bestâ perhaps the bestâ contralto voices
that is known to fame hereabouts. She
has a good compass; I noted an easy up
per A flat and low G's -without number
that .came comfortably within her range,
aq even quality throughout and a rarely,
rich, round timbre that falls most .grate
fully upon the ear. There is not a thin or
harsh thread in the whole voice, and the
equally unforced low tones and high notes
are characterized by the same eminent
sweetness and fase.
The singer has done good work during
her two years' absence, mostly under the
direction of Franz X. Arens and Bjork
sten, and will do still better in time to
come. Her attack can be Improved and
she has not always the courage of her
dramatic convictions, though I do not
doubt that the disconcerting small
ness of Tuesday evening's audience, to
gether with the nervousness Incident upon
a first appearance of any kind, had some
thing to do with the latter condition
There Is also wanting some subtler sensi
tiveness and sympathy in the voice, that
is, however, bound to make its appear
ance later, as Miss Carroll has all the
temperament necessary- Her" German is
good and she seems to favor the German*
song, but her French needs polish and her
enunciation might be clearer. But. all in
all, in Miss Carroll we have a richly en
dowed singer, who is going to count im
portantly here, if not in wider fields than
these.
The evening's programme contained
many novelties, one that I unfortunately
was compelled to miss being Franz X.
Arens' "At My Grave," of which I hear
great things. Gluck's "Dlvinites du
Styx,** also rarely heard, was on the pro
gramme. Other songs were:
"Der Tod und das Madchen" (Schubert):
"Drink to Me Only 'With Thine Eyes" (Dress
ier); "A. Xarratlve" (Albert Jilldenberg) ;
"Schwanenlied" (Hartmann); "Lovely Spring"
(Coenen); "Im Wunderbuch" (Alban Forster);
"Rothaarlg 1st Meln Schatzeleln" (Stelnbach);
"Der Aera" (Rubinstein); "O Say, Have Tou
Seen Her?" (Caracclolo); "Aubade" (Masse
net).
Mies Carroll was assisted by Richard
Jose Ferrer, violinist, who also recently
returned from Btudy In the. East and who
Is a member of the famous family of
guitarists Tiere. Mr. Ferrer's solos. In
which he was capably accompanied by
Â¦William B. King, were ~ the Moszkowski
"Ballade" and a mazourkaby Zarzycki.
Mr. Ferrer has a miraculous intonation,
a big toneâ rough, howeverâ fire and en
thusiasm, a technique that still leaves
much to be desired and Is something of a
rhythmical anarchist. He is ' a very in
teresting player, however. Miss Ethel
Judson Bates showed nice sympathy and
discretion in her accompaniment to Miss
Carroll.

Another Interesting concert was . that
given on Thursday evening at Sherman &
Clay Hall by Herman Genss, pianist, and
Harry Samuels, violinist, accompanied by
Miss Teresa Ehrmani A large audience
greeted the musicians and enjoyed the
following: good programme:
Sonate, cp. 47 (Kreutzer) (Beethoven), for
piano and violin; concerto, op. 64 (Mendelssohn),
for violin:- Don Juan fantasle (Liszt), for piano;'
Suite, op. 41 (Eduard Schutt), for piano and

Next month one of the most unique
musical novelties now before the public
will ;be .here. The Pollard Lilliputian
Opera Company Is now on its way from
Australia to Honolulu, where it will give
its first American performance. The or
ganization numbers fifty children and has
a repertoire . of twenty, operas, including
"The Gaiety Girl," "Lady Slavey." "Pina
fore," "Mikado." . "Dorothy," "Paul
Jones," "Belle of New York," "The Cir
cus Girt" and "The Geisha." The ages
of these wonderful little people range
from 6 to 16. , and the company has been
In existence since 1S79, giving perform
ances In China, Japan, Manila, India,
South Africa, New Zealand and there
abouts. The children's work is said to be
a marvelous sort of performance from
many standpoints, miniature sopranos,
soubrettes, comedians and bo . on, j why
challenge comparison at every turn with
tneir grave and reverend seniors. For
the benefit of those who, like myself, have
wondered as to "the routine education of
the children, their chance at the three IV g
ideals and accomplishments, Mr. Llme
dorfer has a timely word to say. and his
article will give pleasure to any lover of
the great dramatist. There are also three
good pictures of Ibsen.
In the recent death of Lorlmer Stod
dard, the clever young playwright who
dramatized "Tess of the D'Urbervffles,"
Introduced to us so happily tht3 year by
Mrs. Fiske, the stage loses a most promis
ing light. He was not unknown before
Mrs. Fiske's visit, his piay, "The Ques
tion," having been played by the Fraw

Blanche Bates', Gladys "Wallis* and Frank
"Wprthing's connection with the company.
Mr. Stoddard was a bright and original
writer, with~a quaint and characteristic
style, and much was expected of him in
the coming years. His untimely death
(from consumption) came as a complete
surprise and is universally regretted. Ha
made a brave and beautiful end say those
who watched with'hlm in his last Illness.
Miss Virna "Woods, the California play
wright, is now in New York directing- the
rehearsals of her tragedy "Horatlus,"
that Frederick "Warde Is to produce this
season. Rehearsals are being held dally
in Mr. JWarde's studio, and the play will
receive Its first production early this
month. It will be made the feature of
Mr. "Warde's entire tour. The company Is
booked for San Francisco the week of
January 19.

of state is not tried in fair weather, but in foul. ' â¢ - " '
Tne murder ,of the President by an erte'my of social order and of all â¢ government
has stirred^ to its depths the feeling of the people. Naturally this appeal to profound
sentiments which are ordinarily in repose will cause strange apprehensions and the proposition
of novel remedies. Â¦Â¦"'â¢"' . - ' \ .-.â¢'.
Our institutions are founded upon'the equal right of every citizen to the protection of the
law., In accordance with this idea President and people have always freely met, and mingled.
The officials placed in power by the people have recognized their subjection to fair criticism for
public acts and policies, and when that criticism is an appeal to reason and not to passion it is a
means of the political health of the republic. When it transcends that* limit it has been left to the
punishment of public opinion, which, as a rule, has been discriminatingly administered.
The incidents attending and preceding the murder of the President are unusual in' their
nature, and without precedent in our history. A persistent appeal has been made to the passions
of a certain order in the* community against the President. We are simply discussing the phil
osophy of events when 'we say that this appeal was either without purpose at all, and an idle in
dulgence ofra vagabond whim, or it had a deep, sinister and intended purpose.
v The only newspapers that have persisted in it happened to be so located 'as to infect and
poison minds clear across the country. The New York Journal-, Chicago American and San
Francisco Examiner are located like three camps, in touch clear across the continent. Their cir
xulations could easily merge. What could have been the motive of their owner in ceaselessly rep
resenting the President as a contemptible person, finding his highest pleasure in the oppression
and death of the common people? What could have been his. motive in printing in all of his
papers, two months ago, an editorial commending assassination as a means of beneficially chang
ing the world's history? What could He have wanted by saying in thatÂ« editorial, "Read this and
think it over"?. Was it the, act of an idiot, who sticks his hand in the fire unaware that it â¢ will
burn, or fills his mouth with ashes not knowing that it will choke? Or, was it the act of a deeply
malignant man, willing to have the men' in" whom his contemptuous characterizations of the
President had roused a spirit of revenge, "think it over," and nerve themselves to change the
world's history by assassination? ' >
We say that these incidents to the crime are extraordinary. They increase the strain put
upon our institutions by the -murder of" the President. In the presence of the whole wretched
event what should be done? â¢'â¢ . â¢
The change from the dead President to his constitutional successor should be quietly ac
complished. There should be' no extra session of Congress unless demanded by matters not re
lated to this great crime. The world's eye is upon us. Let us teach the nations that here the
law rules, and under its sway our institutions go on in spite of such appalling crimes. Let us
show the world the fact that assassination of a President cannot for one moment impede the
orderly working of this Government. This we regard as absolutely essential to our future safety
and position, and to the permanence of prosperity and order. Not only this, but such orderly
and usual action is inherent in our, institutions. It is what they are for.
Looking to the future, to the different safeguarding propositions that will be made, great
care must be taken. We doubt whether anything should go into the law of the land especially
relating to the person of the President. It would be ineffective anyway In proof of this we have
the example of other governments, where the sternest measures repressive -of anarchy have
proved as powerless to restrain the assassin as are the equal laws of the United-States and
France. Let the equal law stand. : , : â¢ ;
It is probable, too. that laws to curb lampoons in the press will only make matters wp'rse.'
If a rich newspaper owner choose to promote murder, is he not better restrained. by a wholesome*
public opinion which will' outlaw him from the presence of decent men, and put his paper under
the ban as vulgar and incendiary? When such public opinion holds those who support him' as
responsible- for the harm he does, his baboon spirit will be harmless. If there isjnot in, this coun
try a public opinion which discerns between truth and falsehool, and if such opinion cannot 'be
created, then laws are. powerless to supply its place. . ....
We believe that such public opinion is in action, that it is vital and will be effective. The
safety of the government is in the affections of the people. Appalling disaster has fallen upon us
out of a clear sky. The memory of the dead President is best honored by adhering strictly to
the spirit of the institutions which inspired him, and for which he met death like a hero.

number entitled to receive the same. Past
Grand J. J. Applegate was the degree
master and in the work he may have
equal* but no superior. The impressive
ness of his work and the eloquent manner
in which he delivered the charges won the
admiration of a!! present.
In all San Francisco lodges I-found an ex
cellent feature that many Eastern lodges should
adopt. Before installation the officers must
commit their duties and also their charges of
the initiatory degree. The result is that the
books are not so much in evidence as in
lodges where this requirement does not exist.
In San Francisco I attended five subordinate
lodges and at each I met with the most kindly
reception. Many of the brothers assisted in
making my stay as pleasant as pdssihle, but
I am especially Indebted to Grand Treasurer
Harris of California for the many favors shown
me. During my stay I had the pleasure of
seeing one initiatory and two second degrees
conferred and in every case the work was
splendidly doneJ The lodges are well equipped,
and the charges committed perfectly and the
floor work done with great precision. I did
not have the opportunity, of attending, an en
campment, but did attend one meeting of
Templar Rebekah Lodge, . and. Judging from
the work of this lodge, the Rebekahs of San

day by a well-dressed man, who. asked
them, greeting them by name, to identify
him so that he could cash a check. He
said his name was L. Abrams and that he
was traveling for the Harry Unna Com
pany.' dealers in willow-ware,\ in San
Francisco. He also asked them to indorse
the checks. Not ' knowing the stranger
they refused. Abrams then went to the
French Hotel and presented a check for
J71 to Proprietor Joseph Fredericks This
was cashed. Not long afterward he nre
sented another for $65 to J. Crocker & Co
and succeeded in getting it cashed. The
checks were drawn on the Citizens' Bank
of Paso Robles and signed "A. Cortier "
Cortier is a plumber and tinner of Paso
Cobles. When the checks were sent to
the bank they were pronounced forgeries.
Cashes Forged Checks.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. U.-This county
will keenly feel the results.of the decision
of the Supreme Court in the case of
Henry Pfirrman, the Los Angeles saloon
keeper. Under the terms of this decision
it is contended here that not only will
Sacramento County lose the revenue de
rived from the $120-per-year license paid
to it by each saloon within the limits of
Sacramento city, but also the license on
all lines of trade^ â theatricals, pawnbrok
ers, etc. This will mean a direct loss to
the county of upward of $32,000 a year.
While apparently the decision goes only
to the matter of saloon licenses it is de
clared by County Auditor Conn and other
officials here, as well as by lawyers, that
it just as certainly abolishes licenses on
all other lines in the city heretofore sub
jected to license taxation by the county
The Supervisors will be obliged to add ten
cents on the $100 to the tax levy on- Mon
day next to make up the loss. The idea
of the purchase of a new Courthouse site
has been abandoned for this year
in Favor of the Saloon
Proprietors.

Fiftieth Anniversary of the Coming
of Dominican Sisters to Tnis Coast
to Be Observed.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 14^-Extensive
preparations are being made at the Do
minican College in this city to fittingly
celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the
advent of the Dominican Sisters to this
coast. Originally they 1 were located in
Monterey and later In Benicla. Fourteen,
years ego they removed to this city.
The celebration will continue three days,
jj will commence on the 17th inst., when
At the last held meeting of Concordia
Grove of Stockton one.c^ndidiLie was in- ;
itiated. It was announced that a degree
team has been organized and instructed
and that hereafter the work will be donu
in the amplified form. Supreme Herald
Martinoni, who was . present, addressed
the grove on the welfare of the order.
Aipini Grove at its meeting on the 5th
inst. gave the three degrees to seven
strangers and at the meeting of the 12th
elected a stranger. A member of the ex
tension committee addressed the grove on
the subject of the monster initiation and
the. membership promised to make a good
showing and try to secure one of the
prizes offered for increase in membership.
Perseverance Grove, of which the noble
grand arch is a member, has made ar
rangements . to entertain the' grand offi
cers on the night of the official visit. Â¦Â¦> This
grove will also take measures to show the
grand arch that it io in it for the monster
initiation.
The meeting that was held last Monday
night 'by' the representatives from the lo
cal groves in the interest of the monster
initiation that is to be held in the latter
part of November developed the fact that
the special committee headed by Supreme
Herald James P. Martinoni and L. A.
Wolff of the Druids' Magazine has been
visiting the local groves and instructing
the members in the, work that is contem
plated and creating enthusiasm that it is
believed will result in the initiation of 300
or 400 strangers. As has already been an
nounced, a number of speakers have been
selected to address the groves during the
month of October, so that the work which
has been inaugurated will not lag. The
reports from the different groves showed
that nearly all have pledged themselves
to have for the initiation from ten to fifty
candidates each. Â¦>
ber 5 they were with No
vato Grove, where they were received by
a large number of members of the order,
who accorded them a most ' hearty wel
come. The" grove was found to be in l a
flourishing condition and the members enj^
thusiastic in the desire to help the noblif
grand arch go before the next Grand
Grove with a gain of 2000 in membership.
A banquet and addresses ; followed. - On
the 6th they were with Nicaslo Grove,
where two candidates were initiated. The
membership of the grove was found to
be very active and interested in the work
of the order, and .after the work of the
evening the visitors ..were entertained in
right good style. The hall of the Druids
in this place is undergoing renovation. It
is owned by the grove and is one of the
most commodious of country halls. On
the 7th the grand officers visited Dux
bury Grove at Bolinas, to which they
Â¦were escorted by a committee consisting
of District* Deputy Clark, J. Wilkensen
and M. Bisben, who met them at the out
skirts of the town. The grand officers
assisted in the conferring of the degrees
on a candidate and the grove received
Instruction in the manner of conferring
such. A feast in one of the largest halls
in the town followed the work. This
grove in its financial report showed that
it has a good bank account. On the 8th
they attended a special meeting of the
grove in Olema In the grove's own hail,
built on the grove's ten-acre lot, the only
fraternal order in the place that owns its
own home. Two candidates were initi
ated and a stranger elected to member
ship. Their next visit was to Tomales,
where they were met by Judge Fisher,
who showed them to all points of interest.
In the evening they visited the grove at
that iilace. The third degree was con
ferred on a member and three were elect
ed to membership. "The Bard" was there
in all his glory and delivered a discourse
on Druidism. On the 10th they attended
a special meeting of Frederick Seig Grove
at Occidental and were well received; on
the 12th they were with Dante Grove at
Duncans Mills; on the 13th they visited
Guerneville Grove; on the 14th they were
with Verdi Giuseppe Grove at Healdsburg,
and to-night they are to be with Sem
pione Grove at Santa Rosa.

"Yes, father is a reformed man." she
said, "and our friends think it a miracle
that I cured him without his knowledge
or consent. I had read how Mrs. Kate
Lynch of 829 Ellis St., San Francisco, Cal.,
had cured her husband by using a remedy
secretly in his coffee and food and I Â¦wrote
to Dr. Haines for a trial. When It came
I put some in father's coffee and food and
watched him closely, but he couldn'.t tell
the difference, so I kept it up.
"One morning:, father got up and said
he was. hungry. This was a good sign,
as he rarely ate much breakfast. He went
away and when he came home at noon
perfectly sober I was almost frantic with
joy. as I. hadn't seen him sober for half a
day before in over fourteen years. After
dinner he sat down in the big easy, chair
and said, 'Edith, I don't^know what has
come over me, but I hate the sight and
smell of . liquor and am going , to stop
drinking forever.' This was too much for
me, and I told him then what I had done.
Well, we both had a good cry, and now
we have the happiest home and the kind-
est father you can imagine. I am so glad
you will publish this experience, for it
will reach many others and let them know
about that wonderful Golden Specific."
Dr. Haines, Â«the discoverer, will send a
sample of this grand remedy free to all
who will write for it. Enough of the.rem-
edy is mailed free to. show how It is used
in tea," coffee or food, and that'it will cure

nati, Ohio, and he .will mail a free sample
of the remedy to you, securely sealed in
a plain wrapper, also full directions how

The Lake Shore people delivered the
mail to the New York postal authorities,
who in turn conveyed it to the Campania
at 10 a. m.. two hours, before the sailing
time of that vessel:
The Campania made the passage across
the Atlantic in record time, and on the
morninj? of September 14 the New Zealand
letters were in the , London postoffice and
Mr. Spreckels had made his promise good.
Had Mr. Spreckels failed to deliver the
New Zealand mails he would- have suf
fered no penalty. No Â¦ contract has yet
been entered Into between the Oceanic
Steamship Company and the New Zea
land Government, and there is no fine for
failing to get the mails to their destina
tion within any specified time. Mr.
Spreckels had simply said that under any
circumstances the thing would be done,
and consequently he spared no expense in
seeing that it was done. . -
At Omaha the San Francisco train was
met by a special, to which the mail was
transferred. This special got into Chicago
at 10 o'clock on the morning of the. 6th,
an hour and a half behind the regular
fast mail, which left that city at 8:30.
Another special was put on, and by an
almost unprecedented burst of speed it
succeeded in overtaking the regular fast
mail at Toledo, when the mails, were
again transferred to the regular train of
the Lake Shore line.
The Ventura, which was due here on the
2d of this month, arrived on Uie day she
was expected, but too late to connect
with the Eastern overland which left that

carried, were consequently delayed until
10 o'clock the following morning. Mr.
Spreckels was determined that, notwith
standing this delay, the letters should ar
rive in London on the day they were due,
September 14. Telegrams were sent or
dering special trains at, Omaha and Chi
cago, and the race across the continent
against time commenced. The object was
to connect with the Campania,' which was
to sail from New York at noon, Septem

the poison from the natural channels and forces it back into the blood and system, where it
preys upon the more vital parts, and heart disease,-- 'tjuick consumption or some other equally

DEEP SORROW OVER NATION'S LOSS
Hi* first work ln. the new world was ln
Teutopolis, 111., where he spent several
yearn. Later he was transferred to St.
Iritis. Then come the plague of yellow
fever at Memphis in 1873, and he took up
hla abode in the city from which people
were fleeing by thousands. He contracted
the fever and was -pronounced dead at
one time, but recovered. As soon as he
was able to be about the streets he was
again a familiar figure, administering to
every one. He made more sick calls than
any other priest in the whole city. â¢
In 1878, when the plague broke -out again
with increased fury, the father was in a
Minnesota town, 'Officiating as, priest. A
dispatch from his superior i in Memphis
brought" him back to the pest-ridden city
in August, the plague being at its height.
This time twenty-two fellow priests
dropped by his side, he being the only
Franciscan surviving in the city. When
a sick call was . announced he was the
first to respond. When a priest was
stricken he was invariably called to ad
minister the last rites. ThÂ© people of
Memphis called him the "hero of Mem
phis,", a title of esteem, he would have
worn to the end had he remained there.
Never was he known to vaunt his deeds.
He was the son of a wealthy German
professor in a royal gymnasium' of Ger
many. Vreden was his birthplace. HÂ©
came to Santa Barbara in 1894 and spent
a year in San Francisco, taking treat
ment for his eyes. In 1897 he received a
fall while superintending the construction
of a wing to the Old Mission here for the
use of the college. The injury was be
lieved to be fatal and he was anointed
but lingered on three years, totally help
less, but the most patient of sufferers
The funeral will take place at the mis
sion chapel at 7 o'clock on Monday morn
ing. " The remains will be interred in the
ancient inclosure in the mission court.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. H.-Perhapn
no more faithful follower of St. Fronds

In America, which date from 1853, when

The most important action of the morn
ing was the rejection of the proposed
church constitution, the vote standing 78
for to 66 against, a three-fourths majority
being necessary to carry It. The consti
tution was proposed at the last general
conference and is being submitted to all
annual conferences.
Bishop McCabe, ' a thirty years' friend
of President McKinley, spoke of him
with great emotion, and at times during
the mornins? was so overcome by grief
as to be almost unable to proceed.
The State shoot of the First Regiment
Infantry, to have been held to-day, has
been postponed until further notice owing
to the death of President William Me-

Owing to the death of President McKinley
we desire to express cur deep feeling of sym

The members of the Hidalgo Club yes

The Swedish togr-of-war club decided to
postpone Its picnic scheduled for to-day
until September 29. on account of the
death of the President. Â¦

The anirulsb. which the nation has felt ever
since the commission of the diabolical act has
bo deepened by the sad culmination that the
people are well nlKh prostrated. This is a
sorrow which affects all. : and It is eminently
proper that those who officially reoresent the
public should make suitable expression of the
sense of affliction. In a government like ours
âa government of laws and not of menâ it Is
appropriate under the peculiar circumstances
attending- the demise of President McKinley
that such -words as have just been so. elo
quently spoken should be uttered in a public
forum. These sentiments must find a response
In the heart of every honest man and every
lover of free Institutions.
VLet lt.be entered upon the minutes that on
motion the court adjourned out of respect to
the memory of William McKinley, late Presi

Steps are to be taken by the executive
committee of the California State Miners'
Association, which met last evening, to
begin legal proceedings against the coun
ties now giving financial aid to the Antl-
Debris Association. The proposition came
from an attorney who claims to have been
successful in preventing payments in one
county to the association and expressed
his confidence to do the same eleswhere.
The matter will be taken up in time to
present. a report to the annual convention
on its feasibility. . i
Considerable attention was given to the
matter of the acquirement of lands along
the Feather and Yuba rivers for the con
struction of barriers and impounding
dams. Congress appropriated $10,000 for
the acquirement of property and the
State of California a like amount. Op
tions were secured on a large portion of
land needed. These options expire on Oc
tober 22, .and one O'Brien, who holds the
key, to the situation, has been acting stub

Tame Tralee has a strong backing for
stake honors. His two performances
pleased the. talent, and figuring his easy
position on the card they consider the
young courser a likely candidate.
Winners in the third round look to be
Controller. Annie Hall, Amedee, Tiburon,
First Foot, Castaway, St. Ives, Royal
Archer and Tame Tralee. Annie Hall and
First Foot figure to get well along on the
card.
The first and second rounds of a. sev
enty-two dog open stake were run off yes
terday at Union Park." The talent' was
given a severe shaking up, as throughout
the day's sport seventeen favorites were
retired. The short- ends that landed were
well played and, averaged at good odds.
James Lick, a new performer, secured the
decision from Lovina in a course in which
the wise ones laid 6 to 1 against his
chances.

was of the see-saw, order until the last in

of Stricklett's twisters and sent Shay
over the plate with the winning run. The
game was a slow one, dragging along for

void of interest, as the unforeseen kept
happening at close Intervals. Both sidis

TALENT SELECTS
CR0NIN'S DOG
"I received a letter yesterday informing
me that Attorney A. J. Daly, whorepre-.
sents Jordan, got Judge Noyes to sign the
order aboard the steamer. He probably
kept the papers In his pocket until after
I had left Nome, for neither myself' nor
my clients were notified of the matter up
to the time I left." .".Â¦Â¦; ;;â¢...-â¢.-"..:
"The idea of issuing an order giving 'the
plaintiffs possession of the property and
directing the United States . Marshal to
eject our clients in the manner Judge
Noyes did is, to my mind, both illegal and
unjust. . :,-. .-Â¦ â¢ . v. Â¦ . Â¦'Â¦-:' â¢
"Jordan claims title to the ground
through a location which. It is claimed,
died a natural 6eath by the failure of the
locator to perform â¢ the required assess
ment work. He bought the title in Seat
tle and has been attempting ever since to
gain legal possession of the property.
"Judge Noyes left Nome on August 12,
and 'when I left two days later there 'was
nothing to indicate I that he had signed
an order placing Jordan in possession .of
the claims. Judge Noyes' action in this
matter simply means a loss of at least
$75,000 to my clients. Last season he al
lowed the plaintiffs to work the ground,
and out of No. 2 they extracted over $30,
000 worth of gold. I presume they are
now working the property again,- and by
the time the evil is corrected they will
have practically worked out the claims. â¢
Attorney H. M. Wright of this city, who
was the legal adviser of Lane and Dav
enport at Nome this summer, when seen
yesterday in reference to the matter said:
"I was very much surprised to ' learn
that Judge Noyes had signed an order
giving the Â¦ plaintiffs possession of this
property just prior to W3 departure for
the outside. I u. . .
! The petition sets forth that without giv
ing the defendants due notice or an op
portunity of filing an answer Judge Noyes
issued an order turning over the posses
sion of the property to the plaintiff. This
action on his part, so the defendants' at
torneys claim, practically decides the suit,,
so far as this mining season-goes at least.
The cases of. Jordan vs.. Lane. and Jor
dan vs. Davenport, suits . in ejectment;
over Nos. 2 and 3 on Elkhorn Creek, were
among the number of legal matters that
Judge Noyes attended to' while ; aboard
the Roanoke, and it is in these two cases
that the appeal and supersedeas has been
asked for.
S -When 'Judge â¢ Noyes left Nome on the
steamer Roanoke last month he signed
several orders in various cases pending
in -his court while-, he ;was j aboard the
steamer, the attorneys say, after he had
adjourned the session of the court and
announced that he would transact no bus
iness until he returned.. . : : .
The petition lor the appeal and a writ of
supersedeas will be filed in the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals imme
diately, and when the facts are threshed
out before the court the attorneys say
another of Judge Noyes' illegal proceed
ings will be brought to light.
More light was shed yesterday on the
methods of United States District Judge
Noyes. of Nome, Alaska, when the law
firm of Campbell, Metson '& Campbell re
ceived appeal papers from Nome in two
cases involving the possession and title
to two pf the richest mining claims in
that section, which Judge Noyes turned
over to the plaintiffs in the action just
before he left there by making one of his
notorious "deep sea orders."

: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â The Capitol
was closed- to-day out of respect; to -the
memory or the late President McKinley.
and preparations were begun -for receiv
ing- the body, which will lie in state in
,the rotunda, as did the bodies of Presi
dents Lincoln and Garfleld.
The Capitol on both' "sides of the rotunda
is in great. disorder,. on account of repairs
'iri: progress, but'it is not believed that
this, circumstance will interfere in any
.way, with the public ceremony of mourn
ing. When President Garfleld's body lay
, in-thejDapitol the public assembled on the
east fronfof the building, and, going In
s at the main door in double file, passed out
at the west door, the people separating
.in^two lines as the bier was approached.
A "similar order will be preserved at the
forthcoming ceremonies.
. The remains; will be in the custody of a.
'guard of honor, the sergeants-at-arms of
,the Senate- and House- of Representatives!
assisting lathe details' of the ceremonies.
The historical state catafalque, stored ar.
the Capitol, is being put into condition.
.The flag on. the White House was half
masted early this morning,' and on th<:
big- front ; door was posted -the printed'
card "Closed." The White House shades
of the east room were drawn over the
windows and the public was not admitted
to the building. With careworn faces and
soft steps the White House attaches went
about their duties. No public business
was transacted. . . . ' .
In- anticipation of the coming of Mr* -
McKinley and eventually of the family of
the new President,- a large force of work,
men is engaged in. preparing the White
House for, occupancy. Â¦' Â¦Â¦ , Â¦ Â¦

Governor Odell May Appoint
Extraordinary Term:
of Court.
BUFFALO,' Sept.. 14.â Governor Odell of
New York had a longi conference to-night
with District Attorney..- Penny of Erie
County relative to the most expeditious
method of trying and convicting, the mur
derer of President McKinley. Mr. Penny
told the Governor that the case was al
ready prepared for the Grand Jury, and
would be presented to that body on Mon
day or Tuesday of next week. The Grand
Jury would make a' presentment to Coun
ty Judge Emory, who would at once, as
sign counsel for the defense.
The main question of discussino between
the" Governor and the District Attorney
was as to whether the Governor should
appoint an extraordinary term of the Su
preme Court to try the prisoner, instead
of allowing the case to go before any of
the Judges of that department. Mr. Pen
ny's idea was that the ' Governor should
appoint an extraordinary term and select
a special Judge. A list of the Judges
was presented to the Governor, and up to
a late hour he had not yet decided as to
which course he would pursue, or if he
determined to have a special term as to
which Judge he should designate.

will leave here for Canton at 2:30, arriv

Court, diplomats and other officials will
travel on another special train. In the

Special Dispatch to The CalL
BUFFALO, Sept. 14.â Cabinet
changes, of course, are sura
to come, but they will cer
tainly be gradual, and no one
has any authority to make a
cabinet for President Roose
velt.. When, changes .come, it is not *yet
.certain who will be Secretary of State. It
has been known that Secretary Hay is
anxious to retire, but that he is equally
desirous of seeing the interoceanlc canal
treaty put through before leaving the
State Department. He favors a neutral
canal, guaranteed by the United State.?
and Great Britain. President Roosevelt
has been in favor of a fortified canal,
built by American money and defended by
American guns.
President Roosevelt's statement . to-day
that he' wyild carry out absolutely Mr.
McKlnley's policy may mean that the new
President will yield his notions on the
subject of a fortified canal. That being
the case there will be no necessity for
Secretary- Hay to lay down the portfolio
owing to differences with his new chief.
Secretary Root's health may drive him
from the Cabinet, but it is stated on high
authority that there is no man in the
Government in whom President Roosevelt
has more confidence than Secretary Root.
Indeed, should there be a possibility of
Mr. Hay leaving the Cabinet there would
undoubtedly be in President Roosevelt's
mind a debate as to whether he would
offer the portfolio of State to Mr. Root
or to Senator Lodge of Massachusetts.
There seems hardly a doubt that
Secretary Long will retire, especially if
Lodge of Massachusetts is made Secre
tary of State. Hitchcock will retire, as
will also Postmaster General Smith and
Attorney. General Knox. It is believed
that Secretary Wilson may remain as
Secretary of Agriculture.

Dr. Rixey Tells Mrs.
McKinley About
" Her Loss.
Close Friends Support
| Her in Hour of
Suffering!
She realizes for a few moments the full
ness of her grief and then seems to lapse
Into merciful semi-consciousness. Dr.
Rlxey, upon whose opinion Mrs. McKin
ley relies implicitly, said this afternoon:*
"Mrs. McKinley, in epijte- of her great
grief. Is physically better than she has
been in years. She is bearing up splen
didly and ' is entirely recovered from, .her
6evere and tedious illness of early sum
mer. Tou may say she will be^fully able
to fcustaln her part in the trying ordeal
before her. In every way .â¢ she is doing
better than I had hoped would be the
case." . ' â¢-....-
"Is the Major sleeping?"
Dr. Rlxey, who for so many years has
guarded her bo well. Is much encouraged
by the way she Is bearing up, though the
closest possible watch is being kept lest
i*e suddenly break down. Her physical
Condition Is stronger than her mental con
dition. She is forgetful to an extreme.
Thrice she has asked the question:
Bears Up in Sorrow.
BUFFALO. Sept. lC-^Courage
oiiB in her affliction ; as â¢ she
has been . throughout " long
days 'and nights -of Intense
anxiety, Mrs. McKinley Is to
day bearing her burden of
grief with - a fortitude and
Christian calmness that "surprises 'even
those close friends .who, have, supported
her through her Buffering, and during last
Â¦week nave constantly marveled at her
unexpected power . of endurance. .
All through days of waiting they have
momentarily expected to see her. break
down and all of them, feared that: when
the news that the end had come was
broken to her, the shock would be so se
vere as to endanger her life. But 'â¢ after
the first outburst of heartbroken grief
she became more calm and gentle. tears
have all day. been the sad token of her
affliction.
; At the moment when the end came so
peacefully Mrs. McKinley was sleeping
and not until 9 o'clock this morning did
ehÂ« learn the news that It was feared
would break her heart.
ft Bread News Is Broken.
Dr. Rixey. who has devoted himself
constantly to her since the last nope of
saving the President's life was given up,
â¢was at her side when she opened her
eyes.
"Doctor, is the President asleep?" she
asked.
"Yes, but he Is sleeping the sleep that
has no -end.", were the fateful words that
r>r. Rlxey had to speak.
A flood of tears was her only reply.
For a few moments her grief was uncon
trollable. Dr. Rlxey did his best to com
fort her, telling her It would be her hus
band's dearest wish that she be calm.
At last her heart-breaking sobs subsided
and she lapsed into a state of grief more
Impressive in Its calmness than the most
harrowing outbreak.
Ever the gentle, faithful wife, she is
now the courageous, gentle widow. AH
day long she has remained Quietly In her
room. Dr. Rlxey has been with her al
most constantly and she has received a
few of her closest friends. From one who
has visited and talked with her It was
learned .that Mrs. McKlnley*s condition
to-day has been much like that of a child
grieving over .the loss of a father. . â¢

SAN* FRANCISCO Is mourning the
death of President William Me-
Kinley. The grief that came with
the announcement of the Presi
dent's death was shown in the
faces and by the ads of the peo
ple. The commurrity, however,
Jias not yet had time to dress itself in the
black garb of sorrow, bait It is none the
less deep, sincere and heartfelt
To-day and to-morrow the decorators
v.-ill be busy fastening on. the sable 'signs
that tell of the people's respect to the
memory of their departed President.
McKiniey stands for something more
than the supreme executive in the hearts
of this city's people. Jnst four months
ago he headed a local procession that
marched through the streets of this city.
His kindly courtesy, hia democratic sim
plicity, his genial affabittty were then
made known to the multitude that gath
ered to greet him. AIL felt then as if they
knew the President personally. And so
the grief over his loss Is to San Francisco
personal.
Sorrow Is General.
' On the street corners and wherever men
came together the naiion's loss received
full utterance. Every flag that was hoist
ed at half-mast, every bit of black that
-was hung from window or covered the en
trance to store or hozne told a sincere
story of the heart offerings of sorrow.
One whose personality left its indelible
niarks on child and adult had been torn
away, and although far distant from the
scene of death the hearts of his fellow
people beat for him and his wife in her
great misfortune.
The man who brought the hand of death
upon President McKiniey Is dividing the
public mind just now. . As the crowds
Ptood round the bulletin boards yesterday,
waiting for news of the disposition of the
President's body, curses -were mingled
with sad regrets. The public has not yet
ceased its vengeful thoughts, and the
speeches made at every gathering in the
streets are as full of somber grief on one
tide as of bitter oaths on the other.
Theaters Are Closed.
Saturday, the matinee day, was devoid
cf theatrical performances. Early in the
morning the managers of the various the
eters met and decided to close their
houses for the day. In the evening they
opened, but on the "day of the funeral the
same respect will be shown again. Courts
convened and as quickly adjourned, busi
ness came to a halt in all the public de
partments and civic bodies met for the
eole purpose of passing memorial resolu
tions. "Wherever respect to the dead Pres
ident could show Itself it received ready
expression.
More than a day is necessary to drape
this city In sable. Resolutions and orders
have been enforced to decorate â¢ the ar
mories, the flre houses, the City Hall, the
Hall of Justice and the Federal buildings.
Private homes and the stores will be
clothed in black. By to-morrow morning
The city will be garbed in its robes of
death.
Public Comes to
Full Realization
of Calamity.
In the churches to-day special sermons
will be preached and the assassination of
the President will be made a subject les
son to the people.;
In nearly all instances festivities and
entertainments have been postponed. So
cial organizations and clubs have either
canceled their plans or. put them over to
a date -when the national public sorrow
has lost its sting and become a bitter
memory.

The First Regiment of the League of

the memory of the late President Wil
liam McKinley. By order of Colonel Ed
ward J. Power the following special an
nouncement *to the command was made
yesterday:
San Francisco. September 14, 1901,
It is tvixh the sincerest regret and the most
heartfelt sorrow that the regimental com
mander announces to the command, the death,
on September 14, 1901, of William McKlnley,
President of the United States. In this hour
of national mourning It is but fitting that we
should add our. tribute to the character of the
great and good man whom It has pleased al
mighty God to call from earth. We recall the
honor he did our regiment when he visited our
city last May and received the review tendered
at the seventh annual competitive drill, and
the words of commendation and encouragement
that fell from his lips. We may now say from
the bottom of our hearts, "God rest his soul."
As a mark of respect all officers will wear
thÂ« usual badge of mourning: (on left arm
above the elbow, * and on sword hilts), for
thirty days, and the regimental colors will be
draped for the same period. By order of

PARIS. SeptJ 14.â The news of President
McKinley's death became -known here
generally at about 10 o'clock, and the cen
tral, portion of the city immediately dis
played furled and- crape-draped American
\
I>raped Flags in Paris.
The Morning Post," announcing the news
of the President's death in black border,
editorially describes Vice President Roose
velt as a good all-round man, who, if a
crisis' should unfortunately come, is the
man marked out to- meet it.
Mr. : McKlnley came of the stock which built
the cathedral. He belongs to a race whose
leaders are buried there. We could find no
apter mode- of : emphasizing the unity of the
Anglo-Saxon people.' lirf-;".'-' ' i Â¦
The morning Leader appears with heavy
mourning borders and prints Â¦ portraits
and sketches of the lives of the late Pres
ident McKinley and of Theodore Roose
velt. It > expresses editorially the great
sympathy felt in' Grfiat Britain and sug
gests that the only appropriate expression
of national symnathv.will he the holdÂ»ng
of a memorial service In St. Paul'3 Ca
thedral. The Leader says: .â¢ â¢
Mr. McKinley's high character in public as
well as private life will be 'more fully realized
than ever before after he has passed away.
He will not be remembered as a statesman re
markable for original views or distinguished
by bold initiative in policy, but in a marked
degree he has been a typical representative of
the prevailing opinion of tho majority of the
American people, j He has been actuated
throughout life by a strong sense of duty. His
devotion to his country was never questioned
even by those who have differed from him.; He
has been courageous and clear-sighted and
has' left his mark '.upon his. time. .The tragic
ending of an honorable career would Insure for
him a prominent place In the memory
of his countrymen, even If he had not won it
already by good and faithful service to the
State.- â¢ : â¢ . .
The Times, in an editorial feelingly ex
pressing Great Britain's participation in
the grief of the United States, says:
The news of President McKinley's death
aroused the deepest sympathy of all classes in
Vienna and immediately brought into prom
inence again the question of dealing, with anar
chists. Dr. Hengelmueller. Austro-Hungaxian
Minister to the United States, who is now in
Vienna,. Is not hopeful of any concerted action
against anarchism. He says that any positive
measures would be extremely difficult in Great
Britain and the United States, but- that the
United States will probably adopt much more
stringent measures against immigration. â¢
The Daily Telegraph this morning pub
lishes the following dispatch from Vienna:
Suppression, of Anarchy.
A meeting of the London Corporation
to Dass a vote of condolence will be held
Thursday next.
"I assure you that your Grace's prom
ise that the prayers of the church will be
offered for our afflicted people will excite
the gratitude of my countrymen."
All the evening papers contain long edi
torials eulogizing President McKinley, ex
pressing sympathy with Mrs. McKinley
and forming estimates of President
Roosevelt.
Mr. Choate, in replying, said
"I desire to express in behalf of the
Church of England the deep grief with
which we have heard of the death of the
President. The 16ss of so great a ruler
is a calamity to the whole world. The
triumph- of wickedness fills us with sor-.
row. Our prayer and good will will be
an earnest one for the American people."
The .Archbishpp % .of. Canterbury. . the
Most Rev. Frederick Temple, has sent the
following dispatch to Mr. ehoate: *
who would devote himself to the work be
fore' him. Â¦; .
President Loubet sent the following
message to Mrs. McKinley:
I learn with deep pain that his Excellency,
Mr. McKlnley, has succumbed to the deplor-'
able attempt on his Â¦ life. I sympathize with
you. with all my heart in the calamity yhlch
bereaves the American nation, so Justly beloved
and respected. EMILE LOUBET.
The" Premier, M. . AValdeck-Rousseau,
called at the residence of. the" United
fctates^ embassy. The .n-gisters opemed at'
the United States embassy and at Em
bassador Porter's residence, are., quickly
filling with the names cf American resi
dents and visitors and with those of no
table Frenchmen. Paris is crowded with
Americans at the present time, and the
boulevards are dotted with little groups
reading and discussing the details of the
President's last moments. Numbers of
Americans are already wearing, black ties,
and many ladles have donned mourning.
Tho expressions of sympathy from
Frenchmen are as general and sincere as
when -the cables announced the attempt
on the President's life. The death of, Mr.
McKinley, it 13 understood, will not inter
fere with the general programme of the
Czar's visit to France.^ The reviews, ma

Consulate, all the hotels and American
business houses and the establishments
of many French firms on the Avenue du

boulevards and in the Champs Elysees
quarter displayed this mark or" respect.
The United States embassy had not re
ceived official notification of the Presi
dent's "death when the press dispatch an
nouncing it arrived, and at 9:30 the news
was conveyed to the embassy. Embassa
dor Porter, who has not been well for the
past fortnight, was deeply affected by
yesterday's intelligence. He had under
gone a very painful but not â¢ dangerous
operation j for a local trouble yesterday,
and was upset by the sudden change for
the worse in Mr. McKinley's condition.
His physician therefore ordered that he
should have complete repose and forbade
that the news of the President's death be
communicated to him this morning. He
will be notified later in the day.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Delcasse
called at the embassy at about 10 o'clock
but could not be received. A few minutes
later President Loubet drove up. The Em
bassador's physician received him and ex
plained that the news had thus far been
kept from Embassador Porter, and that it
was deemed inadvisable to allow him to
see any one. President Loubet expressed
deep sympathy with the Embassador and
asked that the latter be informed of his
visit, and that he â¢ Intended personally to
convey condolences over the loss sustained
by the .American people. He then de
parted. ' â¢
The .doctor says there is absolutely no
danger for Embassador Porter, who only
needs rest to insure his complete recov
ery within a few days. In fact, but for
the shooting of President McKiniey, Gen
eral Porter would have started on a jour
ney to Constantinople next Saturday, . as
planned. â¢
The Earl of ; Aberdeen, in presenting
medals to some of the Gordon Highlanders
at Aberdeen to-day, said that with their

death. The Earl ' referred ; to President
McKinley as a splendidly, courageous and
lofty- spirited man, and to President
Roosevelt as a brave and upright man,

The citizens of London are profoundly moved
and deeply affected by the sad intelligence of
President McKinley's death. They had hoped
that under Providence bo valuable a life might
have. been spared for the welfare of his coun
try. In their name, . I . beg to tender to your
Excellency heartfelt sympathy and shall be
grateful if you will convey it to Mrs. McKlnley
and the people of the United States. Tho emi*
nent career and public services of Mr. McKin

be remembered by the British people, who, hav

sovereign, more keenly . sympathize ! with the
United States in the sudden removal of their
distinguished President. - # .
The number of callers and telegrams re
ceived at the United States embassy in
creased as the day wore on. The British
Embassador. to the United States, Lord
Pauncefote, personally expressed to Mr.
Choate his deep sorrow. Lord Salisbury
and the Marquis of Lansdowne sent rep-/
resentatlves to the embassy and Lord
Rosebery and Mr. Chamberlain sent mes
sages. I The members of the â¢ diplomatic!
corps left their cards at the embassy.
Mr. . Broderlck, the War Secretary; Lord
George Hamilton, the Indian Secretary,
and many others called. â¢ Sir Henry Irv
lng's message was especially sympathetic.
He said:
The Lord Mayor sent to United States
Embassador Choate ' the following mes
sage: '
"The ocean is not wide enough to hold
all the sympathy 'that is streaming from
the Old World to the New."
Affecting scenes marked the announce
ment of the deAth of the President at the
Ecumenical Methodist Conference, which
passed resolutions declaring that the
whole Christian world sympathized â¢with
the American people. Throughout the
length and breadth of Europe feelings
similar to those evinced in the British
metropolis seem to have been evoked.
Perhaps this is best, voiced by the Vienna
Neue Weiner Tageblatt, which says: â
Grief Throughout Europe.
Telegrams are pouring in from prom
inent Englishmen, societies and munici
palities. It seems as if every little town
in England is individually telegraphing an
expression of sympathy and horror.

it is probable that a memorial service of
imposing proportions will be held in West
minster Abbey, as was done at the time
of the death of General Grant. Whether
the British Government will issue any of

Choate as follows: ''.
KING EDWARD SYMPATHIZES WITH
THE ENTIRE AflERiGAN NATION
To us Israelites the new year is an espe
cially sad one. In common with all fellow
citizens the great calamity that has befallen
this; land, the death of our beloved President,
is felt by us almost as a personal loss. We
have watched at his bedside with anxiety and
hope, while there was a struggle between
heaven and earth to claim the suffering pa
tient. The last words he uttered, "Good-by.
This is God's way. His will be done," showed
his deathbed to be that of a righteous man.
the deathbed of a true servant of ' the Great
King. The key to the kingdom of Mr. Mc-
Kinley's noble character is to be found in the
knowledge that he had Implicit faith in God
and that he strove to discharge his duties -with
conscience, both in his public and private life,
as a loyal subject of the Great King. May
his memory be blessed forever. f

effected, and since that time the Pacific-
Union has been recognized as the fore
most commercial and social club on the
Pacific Coast, and one of -the. leading in

common gossip that the Pacific-Union
has resolved to clear itself of association
with Hearst- Several members, observing
that the board had not given orders to
exclude the Examiner, gave a slight ex

twelve months ago we sought the throne of

At the Beth-Israel Congregation, on
Geary and Octavia streets. Rev. M. S.
Levy preached to an assemblage that
filled the sacred building to the outer
doors. Rabbi Levy preceded his sermon
with a short address on the death of the
President, and said:
"And now, brethren, let us all unite in
a word of prayer."
As Dr. Voorsanger prayed the orgran
softly began to play "My Country. 'Tis
of Thee," the effect of it being- so power
ful that the whole congregation was in
tears.
And now they will be digging another grave
in Canton, and in that latest grave will be
lowered the frame of the latest martyr. They
tell a legend of an old Jewish poet in the
Spanish Arabic times, that he was murdered
and buried beneath an orange tree, and that
the luscious fruit that came therefrom was
nurtured with his blood. Splendid simile to
suggest the final thought. By the graves of
our martyrs we plant our seedlings, little
trees of liberty that are nourished with the
blood of our President. McKinley Is but the
last of them, but the whole host passes in
review. All over the country. East and West,
North and) South, these trees are planted i by
the graves of Lincoln. Garfield and of Mc-
Kinley, and they Fhall grow and grow until
they become fat, and their mighty boughs shall
extend far beyond the confines of our own
land. Thus shall God grant our prayers that
good shall come out of evil, and blessing out
of affliction, and the increase .of liberty out of
this foul deed that has put a nation in mourn
ing. God bless the new President. May he
fellow in the footsteps of William McKinley.
Grave for the Latest Martyr.
I can understand the resentment in the heart
of the people to-dÂ£.y â a resentment that might
easily give expression to retaliation and
vengeance â but this is the time to be careful
and considerate, because it is a time that tries
men's hearts. In the presence of the dead we
must ponder a. moment upon the great bless
ings to which he has contributed and which
he bequeaths to the people he loves bo well.
That must ba our theme for contemplation.
Alas, alas, the President is dead, struck by
the hand of a foul assassin but brethren, we
must be persuaded that God still exists, as the
Immortal Garfield said, and that the Govern
ment at Washington still lives. We have our
legacies, and no anarchy can rob us of them.
From the earliest dawn of man until to-day,
liberty has been purchased with blood, safety
with Facrifice and national happiness with the
immolation of the people's greatest and best
beloved.
Brethren, I am unfortunately compelled to
change the lesson which has been prepared for
you in order to take official notice of the death
of the President of the United States. , which
cad news reached us during the night. Alas,
that we must now change the joyous strains
cf our songs of praise into a lament and an
elegy; for thougri we are in the midst of
lejoicirg, so far as the order of our feast Is
concerned, this sudden calamity robs us of all
delight, and with all the people of the United
States we don the habiliments of mourning and

for an extemperaneous one dealing with
the great tragedy at Buffalo.
Men and women joined in the recital of
the "Kaddish," or "Prayers for the

those who have lost a parent during the
year. The scene was an impressive one,
as the entire congregation recited ihe
beautiful words and tears coursed down

When Colonel Roosevelt was reached
and informed of the critical condition of
the President he could scarcely believe
the burden of the messages personally de
livered to him. Startled at the serious
nature of the news the Vice President at
5:45 o'clock at once started back for the
Tahawaus Club. In the mean time tho
Adirondack stage line placed at his dis
posal relays of horses covering the thirty,
ttve miles to North Creek. A deluKinir
thunderstorm had rendered the roads un
usually heavy. -Without any delay he
moved as rapidly as possible" in
the direction of North Creek, the
northern terminus of the Adiron
dacks Railroad, where . his secretary
William Loeb Jr., -and Superintendent 1 C*
D. Hammond of the Delaware and Hud
son Railway, with a special train., were
awaiting his arrival. : Soon after Colonel
Roosevelt started night came on and made
the trip very difficult and dangerous as
mile after mile was traveled in almost im
penetrable darkness, but, the expert
guides piloted the Vice President^ safely
to his objective* point. Not until he dashed
up to the special train at North Creek at
5:22 o'clock this' morning, did he' learn
that President McKinley . had passed
away at Buffalo at 2:15 o'clock. Mr Loeb
Colonel â¢ Roosevelt's secretary,- was the

the atLir*orÂ«n began to merge with the
shadows oÂ» rÂ«-cly evening and as- -the
searchers were rearing the summit of the
lofty mountain, the responsive echoes of
distant slgnifis were heard and answered
and the scouts and the Roosevelt party
came within hearing distance of each
other. \ , : .
In this connection It may be said that
the officials of the Secret Service have
abandoned the idea of proving that a
conspiracy existed looking to the
assassination of President McKinley. On
tho contrary, they assert and believe that
the assassin became Imbibed with per
nicious ideas obtained from his associa

unwholesome literature and believed him
self ordained to carry out the suggestions
he heard and read. â¢ - Â¦
No chances whatever will be taken for
a repetition of the tragedy, at the Buffalo
Exposition, and an effort will be made to
prevent as far as possible any crowds
congregating- about the President to pay
respects to him or make any other dem
onstration. This rule will be rigidly en
forced regardless of the solicitation by
municipal bodies, citizens' reception com
mittees and others. The sole aim of the
United States Secret Service officials will
be to get the President to Washington,
where he may be free from any intrusion
upon him.

There was a desperate fight- in Bolinas
Bay, yesterday morning, in which the par
ticipants j were two \ crews of fishermen
and a. man-eating shark. Remarkable
tales of the sea have been written from
time to time, but no truthful story of a
conflict with, a monster' of the deep has
ever been told that eclipses in all its dra
matic situations -the struggle of Captain
Nick Franievich and several other ilsher
â¢ men with this powerful and â¢ desperate
product of the sea.
,. It appears that yesterday morning while
the* tisnermen .had their nets set for. the
bass that frequent Bolinas Bay they no
ticed a great commotion in the â¢ water.
The men who were in charge of the boat,
which is known as the Slaviansky, imme
diately made an attempt to draw in their
nets. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ . Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
They were greatly alarmed when they
discovered a great man-eating shark, a
monster very Beldom encountered in these
waters. , . Â¦-.',.
.The seriousness of the situation became
apparent to the fishermen when the shark
plunged toward the boat and snapped at
the rail. The powerful man-eater snapped
off about six inches of the. boat's rail and
the fishermen decided to call for help.
They signaled the:13dar to come to their
assistance, and then this remarkable bat
tle took place; The shark fought desper
ately. ' and the ' fishermen â¢ saw that their
only hope lay in the use of the clubs they
carry -in- their' boats. . Seven men plied
their clubs .upon the head of the vicious
shark until it was dead.
-It is supposed that this man-eater fol
lowed some vessel up, the coast.- ~ ' â¢ -

to secure the co-operation of all those great
forces as one for guarding the money market

were lortncomlng on Monday for all solvent
borrowers to meet their actual needs. Skill
ful operators in stocks were on the floor of the
exchange to protect values there by keeping
up bids for stocks, taking offering* at moderate
declines and so preventing the reckless sacri
fice of holdings and the wiping out of collateral
margins for loans. These objects were not
achieved without a lavish outlay of resources,
as the liquidation was heavy and urgent and
persistent, but Kuecess was manifest before
trading had proceeded long on Monday. But

Therefore, considering the above facts, there
would seem to be fairly large amounts of cosh
already in the banks not shown by the state
ment and made the sums which may be rea
sonably expected early in the week. If money
rates could be kept firm without deranging
speculation there would seem to be a reason
able assurance of imports of gold from. Europe,
sight exchange now being quite close to the
gold-importing point. It Is probable, however,
that the relief which the money market has
already received and that in immediate pros
pect will . tend to . restore normal rates for
money, thus causing the postponement of gold
imports from Europe.
The bank statement of last week was made
on rising averages for cash, because of the
large payments for bonds by the Treasury,
which were only partially reflected In the re
turn. The diversion into the banks of internal
revenue collections under Tuesday's ordeÂ»- of
the Secretary of the Treasury did not become
fully effective last week, because upon Its pro
mulgation there was considerable sums in
transit to the New York subtreasury from
Western points. From this diversion of Inter
nal revenue' collections therefore,' there prob
ably were moderately large amounts of money
added to the cash of the banks. on Saturday
and further contributions will be made in the
current week. The decision of Secretary Gage
to continue to purchase 8, 4 and 6 per cent
Government bonds may cause large offerings
of such bonds this week and upon the
acceptance of these offerings of . such bonds
payments. will be promptly made.

the need was bo urgent. The appeal which was
formulated to the Secretary of tha Treasury
met with a quick response by invitation for
tenders of bonds for redemption to the amount
of $20,000,000 and the diversion of J50,000,000 r of
internal revenue collections -Into national de
positories. This relieved somewhat tha drain
which the sub-treasury was making day after
day upon the New' York money market. The
bond tenders were disappointing In amount, but
the payment for the $7,000,000 accepted, which
was made In cash on Friday, was an effective
aid to checking the demoralization caused by
the bad news from Buffalo. During the middle
of the week there was eo much success. shown
In the effort to protect and recuperate the
market that some disposition developed to set
on foot an active speculation for a rise. Heavy
realizing was accomplished under Influence of
this movement by those who had bought Heav

The Los Angeles Herald gives an ac
count of a company with a capitalization
of $10,000,000 that h^s been formed to
search of oil in Wyoming:
-The biggest blowout that has ever taken
place in the Kern River field, according
to the Bakersneld Echo, must be credited
to the Illinois Crude Oil Company, operat
ing in section 32, 2S, 28. Upon piercing the
sand at 850 feet oil; sand and water flew
into the air over the derrick, the flow
continuing for an hour. The force of the
"blowout" was so great that the sand
cut off some of the walking beam.
The shipment of American fuel oil to
Europe begins this month. The oil goes
from the Beaumont field to England,
where a large trade in this fuel may be
developed. The first shipment will be 50.
000 barrels, which will sail on a tank
steamer.
Shipping Oil to Europe.
The Los Angeles Herald does not be
lieve that a war between the large and
small oil companies in the Kern County
fields over the plan of consolidation pro
posed by W. S. Porter will follow the an
nouncement of the work of the commit
tee of appraisers who are trying to reach
-a fair basis of valuation for the proper
ties, of the several -oil companies In the
Kern and McKlttrick districts. "The in
terests in. the Kern -River field aro so
great." says the Herald, "and are so in
terwoven that thero is little reason to
fear a war. While the- reasons for op
position are not fully stated, 'It appears
that leasing' 'companies aro afraid
that after their leases are taken Into con
sideration there will be a smaller allot
ment of value for the stockholders than
they have in their independent com
panies."
The National Oil Reporter figures out
that the outlook for American petroleum
is very gratifying. "We have heard much
of the Russian, Sumatran and other men
acing regions of oil, but it is a significant
fact that the demand for Pennsylvania
oil still continues. . In July of this year
the shipments of Pennsylvania oil
amounted to 106,000 -barrels a day as
against 88,000 for July a year ago, and
7t>,000 for tho same month' two years ago.
Lima shipments amounted to 4500 barrels
a. day for the last month and 31,000 bar
rels during July. 1900. From California
come reports of stiffening prices and a
more systematic effort on the part of pro
ducers to force better conditions both in
marketing- and transportation. Taking
everything into consideration and except
ing seme handicaps that must be endured
the present status, of the petroleum in
dustry of the United States may .be said
to be very gratifying to all those In the
trade and Its allied interests."
Outlook Is Gratifying.
During the month of August, says the
Bakersneld Calif ornian, the Santa Fe
Railroad Company purchased 315 carloads
of oil in the Kern County fields. While
this was not. as heavy a purchase as for
the month preceding 1 , it amounted to one
fifth of the entire shipments from the
field for the month, the total being 1300
carloads.
The Humboldt Times gives the report
concerning the discovery of oil in Hum
boldt County. The. depth reached was
1500 feet in the Hoagland well. The Times
says that tho oil found in the Hoagland
well may be from a seepage. The quan
tity of oil actually found is unknown.
Professor Watt is in . the vicinity and is
making examinations of the lands along
Bear River. . . : ,
Concerning the ' reported strike near
Oroyille, the Chico Enterprise gives' some
facts. The well is > near Peter Marks'
place. The drill --has passed through' 125
feet of sandstone and has reach.â a
depth of 600 feet. M. M. Ogden visited the
well and ordered that the material should
be taken from the bottom of it. Ogden
told the owners of the well that he was
satisfied that when the well is a tittle
deeper a very large quantity of oil will
be found. . .- - Â¦
According to one dispatch a well on the
Carrega ranch spouted, throwing oil
thirty feet in the alr.\ The Santa Barbara
papers accept the statements . that are
made in this " connection and the Santa
Barbara Independent says that, while a
Beaumont gusher has not been found in
the Santa Maria district at Carrega, tha
well is a good one and runs forty barrels
per day, with an excellent chance of
doing better as soon as it has been
cleaned out.
From three localities in the State news
has come during . the past week of the
striking of oil. In the ; Upper Â¦ Mattole
country in 'Humboldt County, near Oro
ville,. Butte : . County, ' and at Carrega;

sent out cheerful reports concerning their
work and results. The full significance

The Sheba quartz mine. In Scott Valley,

been started up with a full force, accord,

Roland Hughes reports to the San Luis
Obispo Tribune that the Klaus quicksilver
mine is working about fifty men and the
furnace is turning out quicksilver, night
and day. Houses wlll.be built at once for
the workmen, many of whom have- been
living in tents. - .
Operations at the Zantgraff mine, near
Auburn, Placer County, will be resumed
soon. The property, has been bonded to
Eastern people. The Auburn Republican
Bays that fourteen men are at work at

Working Coast Mines.
There are Included in the collection of
consular reports other papers that have
technical rather than general interest.
The attention of miners will be attracted
to the feature that the Government, while
seeking to ascertain the. facts concerning
the crops of European countries that may
affect the marketing of the agricultural
output of the United States, is also pay
ing much more attention to the mineral
Industries than formerly.
In Norway the Manhes process is in use
generally. | Rich deposits have been* re
cently discovered in Nordland, Northern
Norway, -so writes Consul Bordewich.
Copper pyrites, largely mixed with iron
pyrites and magnetic, pyrites; are the
ores- oftenest appearing in Norway. A
large part of the pyrites is exported in a
crude state, the country having no sul
phur refineries. The Government has sent
experts abroad repeatedly to study the
different systems of treating ores.
In Austria, according to Consul General
Hurst, the treatment of copper ore is still
on rather antiquated lines and. the output
is small. r
Concerning the copper working at Corn
wall, England, . Consul Howard Fox re
ports that the copper at present produced
in Cornwall is almost entirely a side pro
duct of the mines worked for tin â¢ and
arsenic, and, in some cases, wolfram. Siz
ing and concentration of copper ores is
not extensively carried on.
Consul Robert P. Skinner, writing from
Marseilles, asserts that the cost of hand
ling copper in France by the Manhes pro
cess is about $28 95 per ton. The Manhes
process is quite simple. Instead of sev
eral costly operations the treatment is
limited to a single casting to produce
matte," after which, the work of the 1 con
verter comes -lirectly. : - : : / .
Any American owner of low grade cop
per mines who wishes to obtain the judg
ment of the German experts concerning
the best. way to work them and also the
approximate cost of the plant, of the Ger
man type, of course, can do this without
expense by sending to Consul Mason ten
pound samples of the ores produced by
the mine, together with, full and precise
information on various essential points.
Cost of Milling Ore.
It is impossible to do more than to give
the more important facts contained in the
several papers, which are quite volumin
ous. Processes are described at length.
Germany, it is set forth, produces only
one-thirteenth of the electrolytic' copper
it requires and one-third of its general
supply for other. uses. The electrical con
sumption of copper In Germany is about
40,000 tons per annum. From ail that can
be learned Germany has little to teach
Americans concerning the electrolysis of
copper. The greater part of all native
ores > in, Germany are reduced / by the
smelting and roasting -processes, and
grinding plays a comparatively subordi
nate part. %^. " â¢
"When crushing and pulverizing machinery
\% used," writes Consul Frank H. Mason from
Berlin, "it Is one of three kinds â stamp mills
similar to those used in the United States;
roller mills, in which two large, heavy wheels
are hung at the ends of the horizontal axle,'
revolving at ' the center, by which the wheels
are. driven -round In a circular path through a
trough filled with ore; ball mills of the Krupp
pattern, in which heavy iron spheres are
driven round in a concave channel which fits
the contour of the spheres. Of these three the
ball mills are most in use, especially for- finely
pulverizing ores or matter for electrical treat
ment. Screening is: likewise of small import
ance in the Hartz Mountain copper district,
for the reason that in the German process of
reduction the size -of the pieces is relatively
unimportant." !
The September compilation by ths Gov
ernment of American consular reports af
fords a large .amount of ' Informa
tion interesting to the , producers of cop
per on .the Pacific Coast. Thie treatment
of copper - In ' nearly all European coun
tries, in Japan and Australasia, in Can
ada and Mexico, is described. The collec
tior of "facts was .brought about, bo the
preface to the articles sets forth, In re
sponse to a request made to the Govern
ment by a New York firm.

growers have diminished their shipments since
Jinces declined, and the feeling is rather stead
ier in consequence, though prices remain un
changed. Onions also stand about the- same.

olution, under the seal of this association, be
forwardfd to Mrs. McKinley.
Resolved, That in William McKinley, whom
the citizens of San Francisco had recently the
pleasure of meeting and appreciating his noble
character, the nation has lost an exponent of
the highest order of American citizenship, and
that, both as a man and 'as a constitutional
ruler, he deserved the highest respect and love
of a great people. '
deepest indignation at this atrocious crime, and
that we urge our next Congress to pass laws
defining attacks upon the lives of the President,
Vice President and any memoer of the Cabi
net 6f the- United States to be treason to the
republic and punishable by death.
Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock was the
time set for the Federal Grand Jury to
report the Dimmick indictments to Judge
tJe Haven, but Assistant United Sta'es
District Attorney Banning moved that the
presentation of the .jury's report- be de
ferred until Monday morning out of re
spect to the memory of the President. An
adjournment was ordered accordingly.
Judge de Haven at once adjourned the
court until Monday morning: at 11 o'clock
Similar action was taken by Judge de
Haven, sitting for Judge Morrow in the
Ignited States- Circuit Court. Mr. ' WooU
worth making the motion for the adjourn
ment.
It is indeed a public calamity that one who
has so endeared himself to the hearts of the
people, not only by reason of his noble and
manly personal traits, but by virtue of his
masterly and courageous administration of the
affairs of stateâ bringing this country triumph
antly out of the chaos of uncertainty of- a
foreign war and advancing it to a state 'of
prosperity and power never before attained by
it-should fall by the hand of an assassin
But, Jf your Honor please, this is not the t'me
to enter upon details of his glorious and Illus
trious career, even Jf with my own humble
sblUtlee I could hope to do justice to the
mightiness of such a theme, but I desire to
add that for forty years he has. been foremost
In the ranks of our warriors, statesmen and
patriots. His name has been linked with every
important public measure of his time- the
record of his action is indeed the history of
his country for that time and the fame which
during his life was the property of his
friends, the grave has made the berita-e of
;his country.
If your Honor please. It becomes my painful
duty to move that this court adjourn out of
r^pect to the memory of our late President
the Honorable William McKinley. In the
aeath of the President the country has sus
tained a loss which time can never repair
The eadness and gloom which pervade the na
tion at large sufficiently attest the affection,
love and devotion in which the President was
held by the people; and therefore. It would
eeern to me in view of the terrible disaster
which has taken place that it would be no
lets than a sacriiege to permit the carrvine
on of public business.
United States District Attorney
Woodworth Pays a Tribute to

On the calling to order yesterday morn
inc of the United States District Court,
United States District Attorney Wood
worth arose in his place and addressed
the court. He said: .

When Emperor Wiiliam heard of the
death of President McKinley he imme
diately ordered the German fleet to ha'f
mast their flags and to heist the Stars and
Stripes at the maintops.

HAMILTON. Bermuda. Sept. 14.-*Uni
versal regret is expressed here at the
death of President McKinley. All the flags
are half-masted.
I am deeply affected by the news of the un
timely death of President McKinley. I hasten
to express the deepest and most heartfelt sym
pathy of the German people to the great Amer
ican nation. Germany mourns with America
for her noble son, who lott his life while
he was fulfilling his duty to his country and
People. WILLIAM. I. R.
To Mrs. McKinley. Buffalo: Her Majesty,
the Empress, and myself beg- you to accept the
expression of our most sincere sorrow In the
loss which you have 6Uffered by the death of
your beloved husband, felled by the ruthless
hand of a murderer. May the Lord who
granted you so many years of happiness at the
side of the deceased grant you strength to bear
the heavy blow with which he has visited you.
J WILLIAM. I. R.
Emperor William also sent the follow
ing dispatch to Secretary Hay:
DANTZIC, Sept. 14.â Emperor William
cent the following dispatch to-day:
Words From the Kaiser.
Subsequently, the Secretary of Â¦ State in-
Btraeted me to acknowledge ' the receipt' by.
Secretary Gage of M. de Wltte's messages.
This I did in a note to M. de Witte. in which
I ccnveyed Mr. Gage's gratification, and thank-
Ing him. declared that the telegram had been
received In America with greater pleasure be
cause he not only expressed his own sentiments
of friendship, which would always be welcome
to the United States, but added new proof of
the amicable relations always existing between
th^ people of the United States and the Rus
sian nation.
On receipt of Count LamsdorfTs message
through the Russian embassy at Washington,
the State Department wired me to return the
thanks of the President and people of tlw.
United States, which I immediately did by
note to Prince Obolinskl, the assistant of
Count Laxnsdorft. I was then informed from
Washington of the Czar's telegram and was
instructed to send a feeling reply. I wrote
Obolinskl. Informing him that I had the high
honor of conveying the cordial thanks of the
President for his kind message, adding: that
the President was exceedingly touched by the
evidence of friendship, and saying that the
sympathetic word; of the great ruter of Russia
had been received in America with gratitude
and th* profound respect of the entire nation.
The news from Buffalo produced a pro
found impression* ameng all classes and
nationalities in this cosmopolitan city. The
Czar, the Foreign Office, M. Witte. the
Finance Minister, and a number of of
ficial and unoffirial people have sent mes
sages to Mr. Tower, who is deeply im
pressed by the sincerity of all the dis
patches. He said to-day:
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 14.â The news
of President McKinley's death reached
St. Petersburg at 11 o'clock this morning. 1
Pending an official notification Charle
magne Tower, the United Slates Kmbas
rador. was unable to inform the Foreign
Office of Mr. McKinley's death, but he
has befen receiving diplomatic and other
visitors who railed during the day to ex
press condolence and sympathy.- The
Church of England and the English-
American Church -will to-morrow take due
notice of the President's passing away."
Condolence From the Czar.
Never did the friendly expressions of ! the
two sister republics appear more Justified than
at the present moment, when there is only
room for a sentiment of profound cordiality.
The Journal des Debats says:
The anarchist Czolgosz flattered himself with
a vain hope if he thought that by a revolver
thot he could root up the famous golden
cross on which Bryan wished to - prevent
humanity from being crucified. The Buffalo
murder, therefore, was perfectly useless, even
from the view point of anarchists themselves.
Political murder Is always formidable, to
dynasties but quite Inoffensive to republics. '
Another article in the Temps says:
mourning of the entire nation, mlnjrles a
gnawing doubt regarding the treatment
and 6kiU of the doctors."
Alluding to President Roosevelt, the
Temps says: "What perspectives, what a
touch of the magic wand, and what min
gled, troubling sentiments must occupy
his mind!" " - â¢ :'
