N. W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.-
The message of President Roose
velt was read in both houses of
Congress to-day and created
a. profound Impression. For strength,
clearness and completeness it Is con
sidered a notable state paper.
Commenting upon the document. Sena
tor Perkins said:
"It Is a great message â able, dear, ex
plicit, emphatic, and especially pleasing
to the Pacific Coast, since everything' the
coast desires is indorsed and recommend
ed by President Roosevelt His strong
references to Chinese exclusion, Irrigation)
the Pacific cable and the Nicaragua, canal
are particularly satisfactory."
Senator Bard said of the message:- -
"It is very gratifying to the people of
the Pacific Coast. All the public ques
tions In which they have special interest
President Roosevelt shows a thorough
knowledge and sound judgment."
"Western Men Pleased.
Representative TCeedham said:
"It Is a splendid message. Roosevelt is
the first President who has ever treated
fully those problems which are peculiarly
"Western."
The Senate, after listening to the mes-
Cfcge, adopted a resolution directing the
ftppointment of a committee to co-operate
*rith a like committee from the House to
consider by what token of respect and
affection Congress might express the sor
row of the nation upon the tragic death
of the late President McKlnley.
The message was delivered soon after
the Senate met. The reading occupied
nearly two and a half hours and was lis
tened to with marked respect by the Sen
ators. The first portion of the message,
dealing with the Buffalo tragedy, excited
the most profound Interest In the Senate.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
message Foraker, senior Senator from
Ohio, presented the McKinley resolution,
and as a further mark of respect the Sen
ate adjourned.
Not In many years have the members
of the House listened with such rapt at
tention to the annual message of a Presi
dent of the United States as they did to
day. Every word was followed intently
from the announcement of the tragic
death of President McKlnley, in the open
ing sentence, to the expression of the clos
ing wish that our relations with the world
would continue peaceful.
The reading occupied two hours, but
not over a dozen members left their seats
until it was concluded. Several times
there was applause and at the conclusion
there was an enthusiastic demonstration
on the Republican side.
message "Wins Applause.
On motion of Grosvenor of Ohio that
portion of the message relating to the
death of the late President was referred
to a committee to consist of one member
from each State to join a similar com
mittee of the Senate to txmsider and re
port by what token of respect and affec
tion it may be proper for Congress to ex
press the deep sensibility of the nation
to the tragic death of the President. The

â The President's positive ree
ommendatlon to Congress that
the Chinese exclusion act be
re-enacted immediately and
strengthened in weak spots dispells any
doubt that may nave existed as to the
bill's fate. Senator Lodge, who Is the
administration's spokesman, will to-mor
row introduce a bill to make Chinese ex
clusion permanent and not for a term cf
years, as in the case of. the so-called
Geary. act. Lodge's bill merely continues
the present law indefinitely and has Pres
ident Roosevelt's approval. :
. Senator Lodge realizes ; that the act
must be amended, but he Introduced It in
this form merely to gain for it an early
place on the calendar of the regular bust
ness to be transacted in the Senate. It
will thus be reached early In the session
â¢ And in -regular order. There will be no
necessity of suspending the rules, and
rushing it through under such suspension
at the eleventh hcur, as was the case en
a former occasion. ---
Are a Unit.
' Under a suspension of the rules It re
quires a two-thirds vote to pass a meas
ure, but In the regular order a majority
of the votes is sufficient. When the bill
is reached it will be discussed at length
and amendments now being drawn by
Commissioner of Immigration Powdetly
will. make It more effective In accordance
with President Roosevelt'g recommenda
tion. As it may be considered In a sense
an administration measure it will mus
ter the full Republican strength In Con
gress, and this is sufficient to insure its
passage.
There are in the House 198 Republicans
out of a total membership of 357. In the
Senate are fifty- five Republicans out of a
total membership of ninety. But Chinese
exclusion will not be made a party quss*
tion. The Democrats realize that tne
passage of Chinese exclusion and anarch
ist exclusion bills will be popular with
the people at this time. It is prodlcted
by those most familiar with the situation
that the bill will pass by a big majority.
It would not be putting it too strongly to
say an \ overwhelming majority.
Opposition Not Evident.
"Thus far," said Representative Julius
Kahn to-night, "we have not been able
to locate any pronounced opposition, with
the possible exception of Hitt of Illinois,
chairman. of the Foreign -Affairs Com
mittee. I have not talked with him re
cently, but a few months ago during a
conversation with me he expressed himself.
as positively opposed to Chinese exclu
sion or any other form of exclusion ..of
what he termed industrious and respecta
ble immigrants. It may be that he has
changed his attitude. He is an influen
tial member, but there is no doubt what
ever of the bill's passage." " : . .- :
There has always existed among, tha
California members of Congress . tack of
harmony and unity on matters affecting
the welfare of the State.. This fact has
become notorious in California, and some
of the . members . admit it themselves.
Sometimes their differences are caused by
Jealousy - of "the prominence achieved bj
an Individual member. . .To obviate this
the Callfornians have had a meeting and

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.
âPresident Roosevelt submitted
his first message to Congress
to-day. It was read in the Sen
ate and House of Representatives, as fol
lows:
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The Congress assembles this year under the
shadow of a great calamity. On the 6th of
September President McKinley was shot by an
anarchist while attending the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo, and died in that city
on the Itth of that month.
Of the last seven elected Presidents, he is
the third who bas been murdered, and the bare
recital of this fact Is sufficient to justify grave
alarm. ..&mong all loyal American . citizens.
Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third
assassination of an American President, have
a peculiarly sinister significance. Both - Presi
dent Lincoln and President Garfield were killed
t>y assassins of types unfortunately not uncom
mon In history; President Lincoln falling a
victim to the terrible passions aroused by four
years of civil war, and President Garfield to
the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office
rceker. President McKinley wa* killed by an
utterly depraved criminal belonging to that
body of criminals who object to all govern
ments, good and bad alike, who are against
any form of popular liberty If It is guaranteed
by even the moet just and liberal laws, and
who are as hostile to the upright exponent of
a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical
and Irresponsible despot.

opponents were the first to bear the heartiest
and most generous' tribute, to the broad
kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gen

to hie close associates. To a standard of
lofty integrity in public life he united the
tender affections and home virtues which are

the Union, he also shone as an example to nil
our people because of his conduct in the most

could be no personal hatred of him, for he
never acted with aught but consideration for
the welfare of others. No one could fall to
respect him who knew him in public or pri

ILLUSTRATION OF IMPORTANT TOPICS IN PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
filled that political office for which the entire
people vote, and no Presidentâ not â¢ even ; Lin
coln himselfâ was ever more earnestly anxious
to represent the well thought out wishes of
the people; his one anxiety in every crisis
was to keep in closest touch with - the people
â to find out what they thought and to en- '
deavor to give expression to their, thought,
after having endeavored to guide that thought
aright. He had Just been re-elected to the
Presidency because the majority of our .'citi
zens, the majority of our farmers and wage
workers - believed that- he had faithfully up
held their interests for four years. â¢ They felt
themselves . In close and Intimate â¢ touch with
him. They felt that he represented so . well
and so honorably all their ideals -and â  aspira
tions that they wished him to continue for
another four years to represent â¢ them. â¢ '
- And this was the man at whom the assassin
struck! That there might be nothing lacking
to complete the Judas-llke infamy of his . act
he took advantage of an occasion when the
â President was meeting the people generally,
and advancing as if to take the hand out
stretched to him in kindly and â¢ brotherly fel
lowship he turned the noble and generous con
fidence of the victim into an- opportunity to
strike the fatal blow. There Is no baser deed
in all the annals of crime. .
The shock, the grief of the country.' are .bit
ter in the minds of all who saw. the dark days,
while the President yet novered between life
and death. At last the light was stilled in
the kindly eyes and the .breath went j from the
lips that even in mortal agony uttered no
words save of forgiveness to his murderer, of
l&ve for his friends, â¢â  and of unfaltering trust
In the will of the Most High. Such a death,
crowning the glory of such a life, leaves us
with infinite sorrow, but with such pride In
what he had accomplished and in his own per
sonal character, that we feel -the blow not as
struck at him, but as struck . at the nation.
We mourn a good and great President . who is
dead ; but while | we mourn we are lifted â  up
by the splendid achievements of his life and
the grand, heroism with which he met'hl6
death. -
â¢ "When we turn from
1. the man to the nation,
J the I harm . done is | so
Anarchl s t I s I great ; as to excite our
â  the type of gravest â ' apprehensions

T 4 anarchist. Inflamed by
the ' teachings of \ pro
fessed anarchists, and' probably also by. the
reckless utterances of those . who, ' on .' the
stump and In the public press, appeal to the
dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy
and sullen, hatred. .The wind Is sowed by the
men. who preach. such doctrines, and they,can
not escape their share of responsibility for, the
whirlwind that is, reaped. This applies alike
to the deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter
of sensationalism and to the crude and-:fool
ish visionary, who,' for whatever reason,' apolo
gises for crime or excites aimless discontent, ji
The , blow . was -aimed . not : at ; this ' President,"

ically, the embodiment of the popular will of
the nation expressed through the forms of law
as a New England town meeting is in; similar
fashion the embodiment of- the law-abiding pur
pose and practice of the people of the town. ,
On no conceivable theory could the murder of
the President be accepted as due , to' protest
against "Inequalities In the social order v " savo
as the murder of all the freemen engaged' In
a town . meeting could be accepted as a pro
test against that social Inequality which puts
a malefactor in Jail. Anarchy .Is no. more an
expression of "social discontent" than picking
pockets or wife-beating.

No man preach- is merely one type of
ingr such doc criminal, , more danger
trlnes should ous than any other be
- be allowed at cause he represents the
largre. same depravity In a
â¢ - greater, degree. The
-f- f man who advocates an
archy directly or Indi
rectly, In any shape or fashion, or the man
who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds,
makes himself morally accessory to murder be
fore the fact. The anarchist Is a criminal
whose perverted Instincts lead him to prefer
confusion and chaos to . the most beneficent
form of social order. His protest of concern
f or : workingmen is outrageous in its impudent
falsity; for if .the political' Institutions of this
country do not afford opportunity to every hon
est and intelligent son of toil, then the door
of hope is forever closed against him. The an
archist Is everywhere not < merely the enemy
of system and of â¢ progress," but the deadly
foe of liberty. If ever anarchy is triumphant,
Its triumph will last for but one red moment,
to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night
of despotism,- . ,
; For the j anarchist himself, whether he
preaches or practices his . doctrines, we need
not have one particle more concern than for
any ordinary, murderer. He Is not the victim
of social or political injustices There are no
wrongs to remedy In his case. The cause of
his criminality Is to be found In his own evil
passions and In the evil conduct of those who
urge him on, not In any failure by others or
by, the, State to do Justice to him or his. He Is
a malefactor and nothing else. He is In no
sense, In no shape or way, a "product of social
conditions," save as a highwayman is "pro
duced" by the fact that an unarmed man hap
pens to have a purse.- It is a travesty upon
the great and holy names j of liberty and free
dom to permit them to be invoked In such a
cause. No man or body of % men preaching
anarchistic doctrines should be allowed at large
any more than if preaching the murder of some
specified | private ; Individual. Anarchistic
speeches, writings and meetings are essentially
seditious and treasonable.

Anarchy Is a crime against the whole human
race; and all mankind should band against the
anarchist. His crime should be made -an of
fense against the law of nations, like piracy
and that form of ma ns teal \ng known as the
slave trade; for It Is of far blacker infamy
than either. It should be so declared by trea
ties among all civilized powers. Such treaties
would give to the Federal Government the
power of dealing with the crime.

to exert its full police power to save him from

Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest
dislocation in our Governmental system and
the danger of a recurrence of. such deeds no
matter how great it -might grow; would work
only in the direction of strengthening and giv

will ever be restrained from becoming President
by any fear as to his personal safety. If the risk
to the President's life became great, it would
mean that the . office would more and more
come to be filled by men of a spirit which
would make them' resolute and merciless In
dealing with every, friend of disorder. This
great country will not fall Into anarchy, and If

During the last five years business confidence
has been restored, and the nation is to be con
gratulated because of its present abounding
prosperity. Such prosperity can never be cre
ated by law alone, although it is easy enough
to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand
of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood
or drought comes, human wisdom is powerless
to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can

guard us against the consequences of our own
folly. The men who -are idle or credulous, the
men who seek gains not by genuine work with
head or hand but by gambling In any form, are
always a source of menace not only to them
selves but to others. If the business world
loses Its head, it' loses what legislation cannot
supply. Fundamentally the welfare â¢ of each
citizen, and therefore the welfare of the ag
gregate of citizens which makes the nation,
must rest upon Individual thrift and energy,
resolution and Intelligence. Nothing can take
the place of this Individual capacity; but wise
legislation and honest and Intelligent admin
istration can give it the fullest scope, the
largest opportunity to work to good effect.
The tremendous and highly complex Indus
trial development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half of the
nineteenth â  century brings us face to face, at
the beginning of the twentieth, with very se
rious social problems. The old laws, and the
old customs which had almost the binding force
of. law, .were once quite sufficient to regulate
the accumulation and distribution of wealth.
Since the Industrial changes which have so
enormously Increased the productive power of
mankind, they are no longer sufficient.

' , ' â¢ ' the- number of very
large individual, : and especially of very large
corporate, fortunes. The creation of these
great corporate fortunes has not . been due to
the tariff nor to any other Governmental ac
tion, ' but to natural causes In the business
world, operating In other countries as they
operate In our own.'
..The process has aroused much antagonism, a
great part of which Is wholly without warrant.
It , is not true that as the rich have grown
richer the poor have grown poorer. On the
contrary, never before has the average man,
the wage- worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been so well off as in this country and at the
present time. There have been abuses con
nected with the accumulation of wealth; yet It
remains true that a fortune accumulated in le
gitimate business can be accumulated by the
person specially benefited only on condition of
conferring ' Immense incidental benefits upon
others. Sucessful enterprise, of the type which
benefits all mankind, ean only exist if the con
ditions are such, as to offer great prizes as the
rewards ' of success.
â  ; - The captains of industry who have driven the
railway systems across this . continent, who
have developed our manufactures, have on the
whole done great good to our people. Without
them the material development of which we
are so Justly proud could never have taken
place. Moreover, we should recognize tho Im
mense Importance to this material development
of leaving as unhampered as is compatible
with the public good the strong and forceful
men upon whom the success of business opera
tions Inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions will satisfy any one capable
of forming a judgment that the personal equa
tion is the most Important factor In a business
operation; that the business ability of the man
at the head of any ..business concern, big or
little. Is usually the factor which fixes the
gulf between striking success and hopeless fail
ure.

In the strife for commercial supremacy among
the nations of the world. America has only
Just begun to assume that commanding position
in the International business world which we
believe will more and more be hers. It Is of
the utmost importance that this position be
not Jeoparded, especially at a time when the
overflowing abundance of our own natural re
sources and the skill, business energy and me
chanical aptitude of our people make foreign
markets essential. Under such conditions it
would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter
the youthful strength of our nation.
Moreover, tt cannot too often be pointed out
that to strike with Ignorant violence at tho
interests of one set of men almost Inevitably
endangers the Interests of all. The fundamental
rule In our national lifeâ the rule which under
lie* all othersâ la that, on the whole, and In
the long run, we shall go up or down together.
There are exceptions; and In times of prosper
ity some will prosper far more, and In times
of adversity some will suffer far more, than
others; but speaking generally, a period of good
times means that all share more or less In
them, and in a period of hard times all feel
the stress to a greater or less degree. It surely
ought not to be necessary to enter into any
proof of this statement; the memory of the
lean years which began In 1S93 la still vivid,
and we can contrast them with the conditions
In this very year which Is now closing. Disas
ter to great busines enterprises can never have
Its effect limited to tho men at the top. It
spreads throughout, and while It is bad for
everybody it is worst for those farthest down.

but the wage worker may bo deprived of even

PLAN TO POOL
OIL INTERESTS
New Project Affecting
the Kern County
Fields.
Output of the District May
Be Handled by One
Company. ~^
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 3.â According to
information received, here, another gigan
tic scheme for the solution of the per
plexing: questions -which now confront, oil
producers is ' soon to be â  given , publicity.
It involves the forming of a company for
the pooling of the output of the Kern
County fields, for mutual protection to its
members. .
John Jonsen Jr. returned from Fresno
and San Francisco yesterday, having been
in consultation with men identified with
the oil business of Kern County. He says
that within one week he will have con
tracts to submit to the oil producers of
the Kern fields for an association which
shall combine the output of oil, rather
than an association of the properties, as
the present plans of the Associated Oil
Company provide. Under the contract the
signer will be required to pool his oil and
take pro rata from the sales, according
to what he produces. The object of the
association will be to make a market for
the oil and to handle the production as
the market demands.
S. N. Griffith of Fresno and Henry Ach
of San Francisco are connected with the
promotion of the scheme.
Santa Barbara's Election.
SANTA BARBARA, Dec. 3.â One of the
quietest city elections held here in years
took place to-day, although'a fairly heavy
vote was cast, the fight being chiefly for
Councilinen. George S. Edwards will be
the next Mayor, having no opposition.
Booth is elected City Attorneys by a
sweeping majority, as Is Kearney, for
Treasurer and Tax Collector. The con
test for Councilmen is vqry close In all
of the seven wards. The proposition to
levy a "tax of 5 cents per $100 valuation
for park improvements is carried by an
overwhelming majority.
Every mother in San Francisco does not know that we

MURDERS WIFE
ON THE STREET
Scores Witness Crime of
a Los Angeles
Husband.
Culprit Is Hurried to Jail. to
Escape the Vengeance
y of the Crowd.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 3.â John Sampson,
a cook, shot and killed his wife to-day at
the corner of Fourth and Spring streets.
This is one of the busiest spots in the
city and at the time of the murder crowds
were on the street. .
Mrs. Simpson was standing on the cor
ner, shortly after 4 o'clock, talking with
another woman, believed to be her moth
er, when Sampson approached and with
out a word of warning placed, the muzzle
of a revolver close to his wlf e s body and
fired. The bullet penetrated the heart and
the woman fell dead.
Instantly a dozen men seized the mur
derer, one .of them knocking him down.
The revolver was taken from him by an
officer, who summoned the patrol wagon
with a police guard. A. crowd of 2000
gathered about the corner in a few min
utes and there was much excitement and
some talk of summary justice. Sampson
was hurriedly taken to the County Jail,
while the body of his murdered wife was
carried to a nearly drugstore and later
removed to the Morgue.
From all accounts Sampson is* a shift
less fellow who compelled, his wife .to
labor, for his support. When she further
refused to maintain him in idleness and
got employment as a housekeeper Samp
son threatened to shoot her employer. A
warrant was Issued for his arrest, but he
fled to San Francisco. Returning to Loa
Angeles recently he awaited his oppor
tunity and murdered his wife.

WITH A CARGO
OF COAL ABLAZE
Disastrous Voyage of the
Big" American Ship
Roanoke.
Puts Into Honolulu After a
Long Fight Against
Fife and Water.
HONOLULU; NoV. 26.â The American
ship Roanoke, whjch was thought to have
been lost at sea,- being 162 days out from
Norfolk, Va., bound .for San Francisco,
arrived here to-day in distress, with her
cargo of coal on fire. â 
She left Norfolk, last June and was
shortly after reported aflre on the Atlan
tic coast. Later she was reported again
as being all right and it was thought that
she was safe, but when she failed to ar
rive in San Francisco on time fears be
gan to be' felt for her, and when a vessel
was reported as aflre from South America
it was supposed that the Roanoke was
lost. . . . â  â  â  ' '
The Roanoke had an adventurous pas
sage from -the other side. 'On September
20 she was found to be leaking. She was
then off the- Horn and found some hard
weather. The crew was set to work at
the pumps. and a windmill was rigged up
to help keep water out of the hold.
On November 20 the second danger ap
peared, -when-the vessel was found -to -be
on fire. After that the water was al
lowed to rise to over four feet in the hold
and remain at that level to assist in fight-,
ing the fire. First Officer Moxon made a
daring trip into the hold to locate the
trouble, and he succeeded In doing so.
â¢ It was decided to head ror Honolulu as
the port which could be most quickly
reached, and the vessel was accordingly
directed this way. She is thought tp be
badly damaged. The long fight against
fire and water continued throughout the
trip, but the vessel arrived here still ablo
to sail well. Pieces of -charcoal were
pumped out, which is thought to indicate
that timbers were burned in the hold. A
board of underwriters is to examine the
vessel and report on her. â¢ \ ' '
The Roanoke is the largest wooden sail
ing vessel afloat. She is heavily reinsured
in San Francisco.
No sermon ever bore fruit that had not
been burled in the -preacher's heart. -
COURT DECIDES
AGAINST CLARK
SacramehtQ's Mayor Is
Beaten in the Oil
' Land Suit.
Judge Hughes Holds That He
Was Not Defrauded by
His Partners.
Special - Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 3.â Judge J. W.
.Hughes of the Superior, Court to-day ren
tlered a decision In the . case of Mayor
George H. Clark and his business partner,
A. P. Booth, who sued to be reinstated. aa
part owners in valuable oil land in - Kern
County. The decision is in favor; of the
defendantsâ D. W., Carmichael, former
Southern Pacific Division Superintendent
J. B. Wright, State Librarian J. L. Glllis,
Secretary "W. TV Sesnon of tho Railroad
Commission, W. E. Knowles, A. J. Sam
uel and-B.'P. Porter.
. In their suit, which was tried last Bpring
and attracted State-wide attention, Clark
and Booth /sought, to, prove that the de
fendants were guilty ' of | fraudulently in
ducing them to part with their two-ninths
share of the property for $3555 45, when,
as they alleged, the entire property was
worth $680,000, and their two-ninths $151,
100.. They charged that Carmichael and
Sesnon know that oil had been struck on
the land on January 7, 1900, but concealed
the fact from the plaintiffs, and by telling
them that they (the- defendants) had
agreed to sell at $100 per acre, prevailed
upon them to sign over their shares . for
$3555 45, which - represented payment on
the basis of $100 per acre for. their portion
of the property. This transaction oc
curred on January 10, 1900. -. - . :
In his decision J udge Kughes declares It
may be said with absolute certainty that
Clark and Booth failed to prove that oil
was discovered on January 7, 1900, while
the evidence showed that it was in fact
struck nine days thereafter, and six days
after Clark and Booth sold their stock.
As to the allegation that the defendants
at that time Knew the land to be im
mensely valuable, Judge. Hughes finds the
evidence clearly shows that at the time
the plaintiffs sold. their stock. to the de
fendants the lands were. not of a greater
value than $100 per' acre. , Plaintiff Clark,
remarks the court, -wanted a buyer at $100
per acre, and he found one. - . . '
Judge Hughes goes to the extent of say
ing that, even though â¢ both , Carmichael
and Sesnon made all the representations
alleged in the complaint and though these
representations -were false and known to
them to.be false, if the plaintiffs obtained
all that their stock was â worth at the time
of the sale they were not damaged and
not entitled .to â¢ any relief on the ground
of actual fraud. . :
Albert M. , Johnson of counsel for Clark
and Booth, ' declares that the end I is not
yet. . He says he\will appeal the cases to
the Supreme Court , and. institute three
fresh suits against each of the defend
ants, first for conversion, second in re
plevin and third, in damages for having
taken the real estate of the plaintiffs. â â¢'

POMONA. Dec. 3.â Ferd Holt, aged 19

LAWMAKERS UNITE FOR THE EXCLUSION OF THE CHINESE
Continued From Page One.
mlssioner Powderly, and they are re
sponding to his request for suggestions.
Congressman Woods is recognized as
one of the best informed men in the Pa
cific coast delegation concerning Chinese
immigration. He has been in correspond
ence with Sheriffs of California counties,
customs officials, boards of health and
other official bodies, and Is well equipped
with facts and figures. A good many
points contained in a bill drawn by Woods
will be adopted by Powderly, and it_is
likely that the Commissioner's bill will
be the one chosen by the caucus on Fri
day. /
Clearness Is Required. â¢â¢â 
Some points in Kahn's bill will be also
included. It is proposed by Powderly in
his bill to continue the present act in force
indefinitely and to make it more effective
by defining more clearly those Chinese
who are to be exempt from its provisions,
so that different customs officials may not
(as they do now) put different interpreta
tions upon the provision relating to the
exempt class. Kahn last year introduced
a bill granting the United States the right
of appeal â  from decisions of commission
ers In the cases of Chinese immigrants,
and making the penalty for infractions of
the exclusion law more severe.
Some provisions of his bill introduced
yesterday may also â¢ be included in the
measure being drawn by Powderly. It
designates certain ports of entry on the
Canadian and Mexican borders (where
railroads cross into the "United States) as
posts where Chinese and all other Immi
grants will be subjected to a rigid exam
ination. *
"I believe that by adopting these pro
visions." said Kahn to-night, "it will be
impossible for Chinese to enter with, cer
tificates belonging to others. The^bill
seeks to protect us from paupers, anarch
ists and all kinds of undesirable immi
grants who seek to enter illegally. These
immigrants, who. on account of rigid In
spection at the big seaport3 of the United
States, have been denied entry, have
found It easy to cross by rail from Can
ada and Mexico because the inspection at
the3e boundary posts has been lax, but I
believe my bill will correct. this."
Western Men "Will Meet.
The call to be issued to the Pacific coast
delegations for a caucus has been dele
gated to Metcalf and Coombs, and they
are at work on it at the Arlington Hotel
to-night.
Metcalf says he has no personal knowl
edge that Hitt of Illinois will oppose the
bill. - â¢ - .
"But no matter," said he. "It will pass.
I have talked with leaders in both Sen
ate and House. There is no organized

few individual opponents. Of course,

and Senator Lodge. They say there is

certainly vote for exclusion."
. VSo will I/-', said Senator. Gibson, who
succeeds Carter from Montana.'
And Smith Is His Name.
Thus far only one feeble voice has been
raised against the exclusion bill. . This la-
dividual is obscured by the name of Smith.
There are six Smiths In the House, but
this particular one is named Henry. ! HÂ«
hails from Michigan. Smith said to Con
gressman Gordon of Ohio to-day that he
would vote against exclusion, but he had
received petitions from his district repre
senting that Chinese were desirable labor
ers and were needed for certain kinds of
work. ! Smith probably will be one of a
lonesome minority, for the bill will pass
by a majority of three-fourths, or more.
"If there are fifty votes cast against It
I shall be surprised," said a California
member. "I believe the roll call will be
dispensed with." said Kahn.
The California delegation resents the
action of the San Francisco mass conven
tion in sending a committee on here. They
declare the committee can do no good,
and on account of Its personnel might do
considerable harm.
NEW LAWS NEEDED
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
Leaders in the House Will Fraxn*
Measure for Adjustment of
Revenue Affairs.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 3.â The *TÂ»
preme Court decision relative to the Phil
ippines has brought to the attention of
leaders in Congress the need of legisla
tion for the archipelago somewhat on the
lines of that enacted for Porto Rico and
particularly connected with revenue ques
tions, and imports from the Philippines.
Such legislation will originate in the
House of Representatives. >
In some quarters there was talk to-day
that, the Speaker would announce the
membership of the Ways and Means
Committee this week, but there is no
authoritiative statement on the subject.
In any event the House leaders doubtless
will prepare the general framework of a
Philippine bill before or during the holi
days.

Inglf mischievous had it not also been entirely
ineffective. In accordance with a well-known
sociological law the ignorant or reckless agi
tator has been the really effective friend of
the evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing. In dealing with business Interests, for
the Government to undertake by crude and Ill
considered legislation to do what may turn out
to' be bad would be to incuV the risk of such
far-reachins national disaster that It would
be preferable to undertake nothing at alL The
men who demand the Impossible or the unde
sirable serve as the allies of the forces with
â which' they are nominally at war, for they
hamper those who would endeavor to find out
in rational fashion what the. wrongs really are
and to what extent and in what manner It is
practicable to apply remedies.
All this- is true; and yet it is also true that
there are real and grave evils, one of the
chief being over-capitalization because of Its
many baleful consequences; and a resolute
and practical effort must be made to correct
these ; evils.
There is a widespread conviction in the
minds of the American people that the great
corporations known as trusts are in certain
of their features i and tendencies hurtful to
the general welfare. This springs from no
spirit of envy or nncharttableness, nor lack of
pride in the great industrial achievements that
.have placed this country at the head of the
nations struggling for commercial supremacy.
It does not rest upon a lack of Intelligent ap
preciation of the necessity of meeting changing
and, changed conditions of trade with new
methods, nor upon ignorance of the fact that
combination of capital in the effort to ac
complish great things is necessary when the
world's progress demands that great - things
b ' dqne. It Is based upon sincere conviction
that combination and concentration should be,
not prohibited, but supervised and within rea
sonable limits controlled; . and in my Judg
ment this- conviction â  is right.
. It is no limitation upon property rights or
freedom of contract to require that when men
receive from Government the privilege of do-
Ing business under corporate form, which !
frees them from individual responsibility, and
enables them to call into their enterpriser the
capital of the public, they shall do so upon
absolutely truthful representations as to tbe
value of the property in which the capital is
to be invested. Corporations engaged in inter
state commerce should be regulated If they
are found to exercise a license working to the
public injury. It should be as much the aim
of those who seek for social betterment to rid
the business world of crimes of cunning as to
rid the entire lK>dy politic of crimes of vio
lence. Great corporations exist only because
they are created and safeguarded by our In
stitutions; and it is therefore our right and
our duty to see that they work in harmony
with these Institutions.
The first essential in
: â¦ determining how to
j deal with the great In-
Pnbllcity 1st the | dustrial combinations
only inre| is knowledg-e of the
remedy vrhlch facts â publicity. In the
the p e ople interest of the public
can Invoke, the Government should
] have the right to in
. i 4- spect and examine the
workings of the great
corporations engaged in interstate business.
Publicity is the only sure remedy which we
can now Invoke. What further remedies are
needed in the way of governmental regulation,
or taxation, can only be determined after pub
licity has been obtained, by process of law,
and in the course of administration. The first
requisite is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public to the
world.
Artificial bodies, such as corporations and
Joir.t stock or other associations, depending
opon any statutory law for their existence or
privileges, should be subject to proper govern
mental supervision, and full ana accurate in
formation as to their operations should be
made public regularly at reasonable intervals.
The large corporations, commonly called
trusts, though organized in one State, always
do business in many States, often doing very
little business in the State where they are
incorporated. There is utter lack Of uniform
ity in the State laws about them: and as no
State has any exclusive interest in or power
over their acts, it has in practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation through
State action. Therefore .in the interest of the
whole people, the nation should, without In
terfering with the power of. the States in the
matter Itself. . also astume power of super
vision and regulation over all corporations do
. ing an interstate business. This Is especially
true where the corporation derives a portion
of .its wealth from the existence of some mo
nopolistic element or tendency in its business.
There would, be no hardship in such super
vision: banks are subject to it, and In their
. case it is- now accepted as a simple matter of
course. Indeed, it Is probable that super
vision of corporations by the National Govern
ment need net go so far as is now the case
with the supervision exercised over them by
so conservative a State as Massachusetts, in
order. to produce excellent results.
OF COMMERCE
AND INDUSTRIES
Recommendation That There
Be a New Cabinet Officer
to Supervise All Trade
Conditions, Merchant Ma
rine and Whatever Con
cerns Labor.
When the constitution was adopted at the
end of .the eightenth century, no human wis
dom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike
in. industrial and political conditions, which
were to take place by the beginning of the
twentieth century. At that time it was ac
cepted as a matter of course that the several
States were the proper authorities to regulate
60 far as was then necessary, the compara
tively insignificant and strictly localized cor
porate bodies of the day. The conditions are
now wholly different and wholly different ac
tion is looked for. I believe that a law can
be framed which will' enable the National Gov
ernment to exercise control along the lines
above indicated; profiting by the experience
gained through the paBage and. administra
tion of the interstate commerce act. If, how
ever, the Judgment of Congress is that it lacks
the constitutional power to pass such an act,
then a constitutional amendment should ' be
Eubmitted to confer the power.
There should be created a , Cabinet officer,
to be known as Secretary of Commerce and
Industries, as provided in the bill Introduced
at the last session of Congress. It should
be- his province to deal, with commerce in its
broadest sense: including among many other
things â¢ whatever concerns labor and all mat
ters affecting the* great, business corporations
and our merchant marine.
The course proposed Is one phase of what
ebould be â¢ a comprehensive and far-reaching
scheme of constructive statesmanship for the
purpose of broadening our markets, securing
our business Interests on a safe basis and
making firm our new position In the inter
national industrial world; while scrupulously
safeguarding the rights of wage-worker 'and
capitalist, of Investor and private citizen, so
as to secure equity as between man and man
in thhs republic.
"With the eole exception of the farming ' in
terest, no one matter is of such vital moment
to our . whole people as the welfare of ' the
-wageworkers. It the farmer and the wage
worker are well off. It is absolutely certain
that all others will be welt off too.' It Is there
fore a matter for hearty congratulation that
on the whole wages are higher, to-day in the
United States than ever .before In our. history,
and far - higher than in any other country.
The standard of living is also higher than ever
betore. Every, effort of legislator and admin-
istrator should be bent to secure the per
manency of this condition of things and its
improvement wherever possible. Not only must
our labor be protected by the tariff, but it
should also be protected bo far as possible
from the presence in this country of any. labor
ers brought over by contract, or of those who,
coming freely, yet represent a standard of
living so depressed that they can undersell our
men in the labor market and drag them to a
lower level. I regard it as necessary, with
this end in view, to re-enact immediately the
law excluding Chinese laborers' and to strength
en it wherever necessary in order to make its
enforcement entirely effective.
The National Govern
!â¦ 4- menf should demand
the highest quality of
Eight -hour service from its em
lnw should . ployes; and in return
b e enforced it should be a good em
and all labor- ployer. If possible leg
ers protected, islatlon should be
passed in ! connection
-f ~f- with the interstate
commerce law, which
will reijder effective the efforts of different
States to do away with the competition of con
vict contract labor In the open labor market.
So far as practicable under the conditions of
Government work, provision should be made to
render the enforcement of the eight-hour law
easy and certain. In all industries carried on
directly or indirectly for the United States
Government women and children should be
protected from excessive . hours of labor, from
night work .and from work under unsanitary
conditions. . The Government should provide
in its contracts that' all work should be done
under "fair" conditions, and in addition to
eettlng a high standard should uphold, it by
proper inspection, extending If necessary to the
sub-contractors. The Government should for
bid all night work for women and children,
as well as excessive overtime. For the District
of Columbia a good factory law should be
passed; and, as a powerful indirect aid to such
laws Â» provision should be made to turn the
inhabited alleys," the existence of which is
a reproach to our Capital City, into minor
streets, where the inhabitants can live under
conditions, favorable to health and morals.
American wageworkers work with their heads
as well as their hands. Moreover, they take a
keen pride In what they are. doing; so that,
independent of the reward, they wish to turn
out a perfect Job. This is the great secret of
our success in competition with the labor of
foreign countries. . .,
The most vital prob
"' â¦â  lem with which this
country, and for that
Great good la matter the whole civ
acconiplislied ltized world, has to
by associa- deal, is the problem
.t i o n h of which has for one side
working-men. the betterment of so
cial conditions, moral
-f f- and physical, in large
. cities, and for another
side the effort to deal with that tangle of far
reaching questions which we group together
when we speak of "labor." The chief factor
in the success of each manâ wageworker. far
mer t and capitalist alikeâ must ever be the
sum total of his own individual qualities and
abilitiee. Second only to this comes the power
of acting in combination or association with
others. Very great good has been and will be
accomplished by associations or unions of
wageworkers, when managed with forethought,
and when they combine insistence upon their
own rights with law-abiding respect for the
rights of others. The display of these quali
ties in such bodies is a duty to the nation
no less than to the associations themselves.
Finally, there must- also in many cases be ac
tion by the Government â  in order to safeguard
the rights and interests of alL Under our con
stitution there is much more scope for such
action by the State and the municipality than
by the nation. But on points such as .those
touched on above the National Government can
act.
When all Is said and done, the rule of broth
erhood remains as the indispensable prerequi
site to success lrf* the kind of national life for
which . we strive. Each man must work for
himself, and unless he so Â»vorks no outside
help can avail him; but each man must re
member also that he Is indeed his brother's
keeper, and that while no man who refuses
to walk can be carried # with advantage to him
self or any one else, yet that each at times
stumbles or halts, that each at times needs
to have the helping hand outsretched to him.
To be permanently effective, aid must always
take the form of helping a man to help him
self; and we can all best help ' ourselves by
Joining together in the work that Is of com
mon interest to all.
Our present immigration laws are unsatis
factory. We need every honest and efficient
Immigrant fitted to become an American citi
zen, every immigrant who comes here to stay,
I who brings here a strong body, a stout heart,
a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his
duty, well in every .w.ay and to bring up his
children as law-abiding and - God-fearing mem
bers of the community. But there should be a
comprehensive law enacted with the object of
working a threefold improvement . over, our
present system. First, we should aim to ex
clude absolutely not only all persons who are
known to be believers in anarchistic principles
or members of anarchistic societies, but also
all persons who are of a low moral tendency
or of unsavory reputation. This means that
we should require a more thorough system of
inspection abroad and a more rigid system of
examination at our immigration ports, the
former being especially necessary. . ' .

not keep out all anarchists, for many of them
belong to the Intelligent criminal class. But
it would do what Is also in point, that is, tend
to decrease the sum of ignorance, Â»o potent In
producing the envy, suspicion, malignant pasr
sion. and hatred of order, out of which anar
chistic sentiment ineviably springs. Finally,,
all persons should be excluded who are below
a certain standard of economic fitness to enter
our industrial field as competitors with Ameri
can labor. There should be proper proof of per
sonal capacity to earn an American living and
enough money to Insure a decent start under
American conditions. This would stop, the in
flux of cheap labor, and the resulting compe
tition which gives rise to so much of bitterness
in American Industrial life; and It would dry
up the springs of the pestilential social condi
tions in our great - cities, where anarchistic
organizations have their greatest possibility of
rrowth.
Both the educational and economic tests in a
wise immigration law should be designed to
protect and elevate the general body politic
and social. A -very close supervision should be
exercised over the_ steamship companies which
mainly bring over the Immigrants, and they
should be held to" a strict accountability for
any Infraction of the law.

how far this is must be determined according
to the individual case, remembering always
that every application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national needs must be con
ditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties
must never be reduced below the point that will,
cover the difference between the labor cost
here and abroad. The well-being of the wage
worker is a prime consideration of our entire
policy of economic legislation. â¢ ;
Subject to this proviso of the proper protec
tion'necessary to our industrial well-being, at
home, the principle of reciprocity must com
mand our hearty support. The phenomenal
growth of our export trade emphasizes the ur
gency of the need for wider markets and for a
liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations.
Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the
way of trade restrictions should be avoided.
The customers to whom we dispose of our sur
plus products in the long run, directly or Indi
rectly, purchase those surplus products by giv
ing us something in return. Their ability to
purchase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tariff, as
to enable us to take from them those products
which we can use without harm to our own
industries and labor, or the use of which will
be of marked benefit to us.
It is most important that we should main
tain the high level of our present prosperity.
We have now reached the point in the devel
opment of our interests where we are not only
able to supply our own markets but to .pro
duce a constantly growing surplus for which
we must find markets abroad. To secure these
markets we can utilise' existing duties in any
case where they 'are' no longer needed for the
purpose of protection, or in any case where the
article Is not produced here and the duty is no
longer necessary' for revenue, as giving: ifs
something to offer in exchange for what we
ask, â  The cordial relations \witli other, nations
which are so desirable will- naturally be .pro
moted by the course thus required by* our
own interests. ': , â¢:Â«â¢â¢''
The natural line of development for a pol
icy of reciprocity will be In connection with
those of our productions which no longer re
quire all of the support once needed to estab
lish th"m upon a sound basis, and with those
others where either because of natural or of
economic causes we are beyond the reach of
successful competition.
I ask the attention of the Senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my prede
cessor.
The condition of the American merchant
marin'e is such as to call for lmmedlte 'reme
dial action by the Congress. : It is discredit-'
able to us as a nation that ' our merchant
marine should be utterly insignificant in com
parison to that of 'other nations Which . we
overtop in other forms of business. We should
not longer submit to conditions under which
only a trifling portion of our great commerce
is carried ' in our own ships. To remedy U;Ib
state of things would not merely serve to build
up our shipping interests, but it would 'also
result in benefit to all who are interested In
the permanent establishment of a wider mar-,
ket for American products, and would pro-'
vide an auxiliary force for the navy. Ships
work for their own countries Just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
lines, If established to the principal countries
with which we have dealings, would be of
political as well as commercial benefit. From
every standpoint it is unwise for the United
States to continue to rely upon the. ships of
competing nations for the distribution of
our goods. It should be made advantageous
to carry American goods in American-built
ships. ;
' At present American shipping is under cer
tain great disadvantages when put In com
petition with the shipping of foreign coun
tries. Many of the fast foreign steamship?,
at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are sub
sidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and
steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow spood
and mail carriers of high speed, have to meet
tho fact that the original cost of building
American ships- is, greater than is the cape
abroad; that the wages paid American of
ficers and seamen are very much higher, than
those paid the officers and seamen of, foreign
competing countries; and that the standard of
living on our ships is far superior to the
standard . of living on the ships of our com
mercial . rivals. â¢
. Our Government should take such action as
will remedy these, inequalities. The American
merchant marine, should . be restored to the
ocean. -

SUPERVISION

Interstate Commerce 'â > A ct r
Ought to Be. Amended' So
, Thai Rates Should .Be.
Just to and Open to All:
Shippers Alike. â â¢'
1 In 1887 a measure 'was enacted for the regu
lation of interstate railways, commonly known
as the interstate commerce act. ' The. cardinal
provisions' of that "act were that railway rates
should be Just and reasonable and that, all
shippers, localities and commodities should be
accorded equal treatment. A commission was
.created and endowed with what were sup
posed to be the. necessary powers to execute
the provisions of this act.
That law was largely an experiment. Expe
rience has shown the wisdom of its purposes,
but has also shown, possibly, that -some of its
requirements are wrong, certainly that the
means devised for the enforcement of its pro
visions are defective. Those who complain of
the management of the railways allege that
established rates are not maintained; that re
bates and similar devices are habitually re
sorted to; that these preferences are usually
in favor of the large shipper; that they drive
out of business the smaller competitor; that
while many rates are too low, many others
are excessive; and that gross preferences are
made, affecting both localities and commodi
ties. Upon the other hand, the railways as
sert that the law by its very terms tends to
produce many of these illegal practices by de
priving carriers of that right of concerted ac
tion which they claim is necessary to estab
lish'and maintain non-discriminating rated.
The act should be amended. The railway Is
a public servant. Its rates should be Just to
and open to all shippers alike. The Govern
ment should see to it that within its Juris
diction this is so p.nd should provide a speedy,
inexpensive and effective remedy to that end
.At the same time It must not be 'forgotten
that our railways are the arteries through
which the commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the
enactment of legislation which would unnec
essarily interfere with the development and
operation of these commercial agencies. The
subject is one of great Importance and calls
for ' the earnest . attention of Congress.
GOVERNMENT AID
FOR AGRICULTURE
Preservation of Forests Is
Required and- the Fedrral
j Officers Should Assist in .
Reclamation of Arid
Lands by. Building Reser
voirs. \ . .
The Department of Agriculture during" the
past fifteen years has steadily broadened its
work on economic lines, and has accomplished
results of . real value in upbuilding domestic
and foreign trade. It has . gone into new
fields until it is now in touch with all sec
tions of our country and with two of â¢ the
island groups that have lately come under
our Jurisdiction, whose people must look to
agriculture as a livelihood. . It is searching
the world for exalns. grasses, fruits and 'vege
tables specially fitted for introduction into lo
calities in the several States and Territories
where they may add materially to our re
sources. By scientific attention to soil survey
and possible new crops, to breeding of new
varieties of plants, to experimental shipments,
to animal industry and applied chemistry,
very practical aid has been given our farming
and stock-growing interests. The products of
the farm have taken an unprecedented place
in our export trade during the year that has
just closed. â¢ .
Public opinion throughout the United States
has moved steadily- toward a Just appreciation
of the value of forests, whether planted or
of natural growth. The great part played by
â them In the creation and maintenance of. the
national wealth Is now more fully realized
than ever before. ' â¢

I ' â  . | but, on the contrary,
â f â +- 'Â£ives the assurance of
â  larger and more cer
tain supplies. â¢ The fundamental Idea , of . for
estry Is the perpetuation j of forests by use.
.Forest protection Is not an end of itself;, it
is a means to Increase and sustain the re
sources of our . . country 'and the industries
which depend upon them. The preservation
of our forests Is an Imperative business neces
sity. We have come to see clearly, that what
ever destroys the forest, except to . make _-way
for agriculture, threatens j our well being. ,
â The practical usefulness' of the national for
est reserves to the mining, grazing, irrigation
and other interests of the regions in which the
reserves lie has led to a widespread demand
by the people^of the . West â  for their protection
and extension. The forest reserves will inevit
ably be of- still greater use In the; future than
in the past. Additions should be made to
them whenever ! practicable, j and' their I useful
ness should* be increased by a thoroughly busi
ness-like management. â 
'" At â  present â¢ the protection of the 'forest re
eorves rests with the General Land Office, the
mapping and description of their timber with"
the , United States Geological Survey, and the
preparation of plans for their conservative use
with the Bureau ' of . ; Forestry, which Is also
charged -with the general advancement of prac
tical forestry in theiUnited States. These va-
Houh functions should be united In the Bureau
of Forestry, to which they; properly belong.-
The present diffusion of responsibility i is bad
from every standpoint. If prevents that effec
tive co-operation between the Government and
. the. men i. who utilize, the resources- of the 're
serves, | without: which the interests of both
must suffer. The scientific bureaus generally
should be put under the . Department of Agri- 1
culture. J The President should -have,; by law
the: power of. transferring < lands for: Use as
â forest reserves to the Department of â  Agricul-
ture. He already has such power In the case
of lands , needed by the Departments of War
and the Navy.
The wise administration of the forest reserves
will be not less helpful to the interests which
depend on water than to those which depend
on wood and grass. The water supply Itself
depends upon the forest. In the arid region
.it is water, not land, . which measures produc
tion. The western half of the United States
would sustain a population greater than that
of. our whole country to-day If the waters that
now run to waste were saved and used for ir
rigation. The forest and water problems are
perhaps the most vital internal questions of
the United. States at the present time.
Certain of the forest
â¦ â¦â  reserves should also be
- . made preserves for the
Provision wild forest creatures.
m li o ii 1 cl be All of the reserves
made to pro- should be better, pro
t e c t vrild tectedfrom fires. Many
creatures. of them need special
protection because ' of
â â¦ 4 the great Injury done
by livestock, above all
by sheep. The increase in deer, elk and other
animals In the Yellowstone Park shows what
may be expected when other mountain forests
are properly protected by law and properly
guarded. Some of these areas have been so de
nuded of surface vegetation ' by overgrazing
that the ground breeding birYJs, Including
grouse and quail, and many mammals, includ
ing deer, have been exterminated or driven
away. At the same time the water-storing ca
pacity of the surface has been decreased or
destroyed, thus promoting floods in times of
rain and diminishing the flow of streams be
tween rains.'
In cases where natural conditions have been
restored for a few years vegetation has again
carpeted the ground, birds and deer are com
ing back, and hundreds of persons, especially
from the immediate neighborhood, come each
summer to enjoy the privilege of camping.
Sime at least of the forest reserves should
afford perpetual protection to the native fauna
and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds
and free camping grounds for the ever-Increas
ing numbers of men and women who have
learned to find rest, health and recreation In
the splendid forests nnd flower-clad meadows
of our mountains. The forest reserves should
be set apart forever for thÂ« usa and benefit
of our people as a whole and not sacrificed to
the Phort-slKhted greed of a few.
The forests are natural reservoirs. Bv re
straining the streams In flood and replenishing
them in drought they make possible the use of
waters otherwise wasted. They prevent the
soil from washlne. and so prot^t the storage
reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest con
servation Is therefore an essential condition of
wflter conservation.
The forests alone cannot; however, fully reg
ulate and conserve the water* of the arid re
gion. Great Ftorajre works are necessary to
equalize the flow of streams and to save the
flood waters. Their construction has been con
clusively shown to be an undertaking too vast
for private effort. Nor ran It be best accom
plished jby the individual States acting alonÂ«Â».
Fnr-n>ach!ner Interstate problems are involved
pnd the resources of slnele States would often
be inadequate. It Is 'properly a national func
tion.' at -least In some of its features. It is as
right for th<Â» national Government to make the
Ftreams and rivers of the arid region useful
by engineering works for water storage ns to
make userul the rivers and the harbors of the
humid rpÂ«rlon by enelneer'nsr wnrks of nnother
kind. The storing of the floods In reservoirs at
the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlarge
ment of our present polloy of rl\-er control, un
der which levees nre built on the lower reaches
of the same streams.
The Government should construct and main
tain these reservoirs as it does other public
works. Where their purpose is to feirulate the
flow of streams the water should be turned
freely Into the channels In the dry season to
take the Fame course under â¢ the same laws
as the natural 'â  flow. â

To accomplish this . object water must be

The pioneer settlers on the arid public do
main chose their homes alonu streams frdtn
which they could thpmselves divert the. water
to reclaim their . hoiain<*-Â«i. Such opportunities
are practically g-one. There remain, however,
vast areas of nubile land which can be mart Â»
available for homestead settlement, but only
by reservoirs and main-line' canals impracti
cable for private enterprise. These irrigation
works FhnuUl be built by the national Govern
ment. The lands reclaimed by them should be
reserved by the Government for actual settlers,
and the cost of construction should be so far
as possible repaid by the land reclaimed. The
distribution of the water, the division of the
streams amomr Irrltrators. should be left "to
the settlers themselves . In conformity with
State laws and without Interfprence with those
laws or with vested rights. The policy of the
national Government should' be to aid Irriga
tion In the -several States and Territories in
puch manner as will enable the people In the
local communities to help themselves, and as
will stimulate needed reforms in the State laws
and regulations governing Irrigation. â 
The reclamation and settlement of the arid
lands will enrich. every portion of our country.
Just as , the settlement of the Ohio and Mis
sissippi valleys brought prosperity to the At
lantic States. , The increased demand for man.
ufactured articles will stimulate industrial pro
duction, while wider home markets and the
trade of Asia will j consume , the larger food
supplies and , effectually prevent Western com-'
petition with Kastern agriculture. Indeed, the
products of Irrigation will be consumed chiefly
in upbuilding local centers of mining and other
industries, which - would otherwise not come
into existence at all.- Our people as a' whole
will profit, for successful home-making is but
another name for the upbuilding of the nation.

expended In the construction of irrigation works
and many million acres of arid land reclaimed.
A high degree of enterprise and ability has
been shown in the work itself, but as mucn
cannot be said In reference to the laws relat
ing thereto. The security and value of the
homes created depend largely on the stability
of titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court de
cisions rendered In ordinary suits at law. w | tn
a few creditable exceptions the arid States
have failed to provide for the certain and Just
division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax
and uncertain laws have made It aossible to
establish rights to water In excess of actual
uses or necessities and many streams have al
ready passed into private ownership or a con
trol equivalent to ownership.
Whoever controls a stream practically con
trols the land it renders productive, and the
doctrine of private ownership of water apart
from land cannot prevail without causing en
during wrong. The recognition of such owner
ship, which has been permitted to grow up In
the arid regions, should give way to a more
enlightened and larger recognition of the rights
of the public in the control and disoosal of
tbe public water supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions obtaining in humid regions, where
water Is too abundant to Justify hoarding it,
have no proper application in a dry country.
In the arid States the

Granting perpetual
â¢f ' Â»â â ' f water rights to others
than users, without
compensation to the public. Is open to all the
objections which apply to giving away per
petual franchises to the public utilities- of
cities. A few of the Western States have al
ready recognized this and have incorporated
in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual
State ownership of water.
The benefits which have followed the unaid
ed development of the past Justify the nation's
aid and co-operation in the more difficult and
important work yet to be accomplished. Laws
so vitally affecting homes as those which con
trol the water supply will only be effective
when they have the sanction of the irrlgators;
reforms can only be final and satisfactory when
they come through the enlightenment of the
people most concerned. The larger development
which national . aid Insures should, however,
awaken in every arid State the determination
to make its irrigation system equal in Justice
and effectiveness that of any country in the
civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise
than for Isolated communities to continue to
learn ei'erything experimentally instead of
profiting by what is already known elsewhere.
We are dealing with a new and momentous
question in the pregnant years while Institu
tions are forming, and what we do will affect
not only the present but future generations.
Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the
largest area of land and provide homes'- fcr
the largest number of people, but to create
for this new industry the best possible social
and industrial conditions; and this requires that
we not only understand the existing situation,
tmt avail ourselves of the best experience of
the time in the solution of its problems. A
careful study should be made, both by the
nation and the States, of the irrigation laws
and conditions here and abroad. Ultimately it
will probably be necessary for the nation to
co-operate with the several arid States In pro
portion as these States by their legislation and
administration show themselves fit to receive
It. . - â¢
In Hawaii ! our aim must be to develop the
Territory on the traditional American lines.
We do not wish a region of large estates tilled
by cheap labor; we wish a healthy American
community of men who themselves till the
farms they own. All our legislation for the
Islands should be shaped with this end in view;
the well-being of the average home-maker
must afford the true test of the healthy de
velopment of the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled on our
homestead system.
It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more
necessary, to report as to Porto Rico than as
to any State or Territory within our continental
limits. The island is thriving as never before,
and it is bc<ng administered efficiently and
honestly. Its people are now enjoying liberty
and order under the protection of the Unite 1
States, and upon this fact we congratulate
them and ourselves. Their material welfare
must be as carefully and Jealously considered
as the welfare of any other portion of our
country. We have given them the great gift
of free access for their products to the mar
kets of the United States. I ask the atten
tion of the Congress to the need of legislation
concerning the public lands of Porto Rico. '

They are very rich tropical islands. Inhabited
by many varying- tribes, representing widely
different stages of progress toward civilization
Our earnest effort is to help these people up

Jeads to self-government. We hope to make
our administration of the islands honorable to
our nation by making it of the Mghest benefit
to the Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest
of what we intend to do. we point to what
we have done. Already a greater measure of
material prosperity and of governmental hon
esty and efficiency has been attained in the
Philippines than- ever before In their history.

In dealing with the Philippine people we must

and steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. \y e
do not desire to do for the Islanders merely,
what has elsewhere been done for tropic peo
ples by even the best foreign governments. We
hope to do for them what has never before
been done for any people of the tropicsâ to
make them fit for | self-government, after the
fashion of the really free nations.
History may safely be cnaiienged to show a
single instance in which a masterful race such
; ae ours, having been forced by the exigencies
of war to take possession of an alien land,
has behaved to its inhabitants with the dis
interested zeal for their progress that our peo
ple have shown In the Philippines. To leave
the Islands at this time would mean that they
would fall Into a welter of murderous nn
archy. Such desertion of duty on our pnrÂ»
would be a crime against humanity. The
character of Governor Taft and of his asso
ciates and subordinates Is a proof, if such
be needed, of the sincerity of our effort to
give the islanders a constantly increasing
1 measure â¢ of ' self-government exactly as - tast
as they show themselves fit to exercise it
Since the civil government was established
not an appointment haa been made In the
islands with any reference to considerations
of political influence, or to aught else sav*
the fitness of the man and the needs of flip
service.
In our anxiety for the welfare and progrea*
of the Philippines it may be that here and
there we have gone too rapidly In giving th?m
local self-government. It is on this aide that
our error, If any, haa been committed. No
competent observer, sincerely desirous of find

tening the process. To have taken a single
step farther, or faster in advance would have
been folly and weakness, and might well have
been crime. We are extremely anxious that
the natives shall show the power of governing
themselves. We are anxious, first for their
aakes, and next because It relieves us of a
great burden. There need not be the slightest
fear of our not continuing to give them alt
the liberty for which they are fit.

There is not a locality fitted for selJ-govern

well be that in certain cases it will have to
be withdrawn because the Inhabitants show
themselves unfit to exercise it: such instance*
have already occurred. In other words, ther
is not the slightest chance of our failing to
show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. 1 fcr
danger comts In the opposite direction. j
There are still troubles ahead in the islands.
The insurrection has become an affair of local
banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher
regard than the brigands of portions of the
Old World. Encouragement, direct or indirect,
to these insurrectors stands on the same foot
ing as encouragement to hostile Indians in the
days when we still had Indian wars. Exact
ly as our aim ia to give to the Indian who re
mains peaceful the fullest and amplest con
sideration, but to have it understood that w-Â»
will show no weakness if ne goes on the war
path, so we must make it evident, unless we
are false to our own traditions and to the
demands of civilization and humanity, Â»ha:
while we will do everything la our pow

sternest measures with the Filipino wh

ladrone.
The heartiest praise is due to large numbers
of the natives of the islands for their st- i
loyalty. The Macabebes have been conspk :
ous for their courage and devotion to the fla^.
I recommend that the Secretary of War tw
empowered to take some systematic action in
the way of aiding those of these men who ar<>
crippled in the service and the families at
those who are killed.
The time has come when there should be
additional legislation for the Philippine-*.
Nothing better can be done for the lslanJa
than to Introduce industrial enterprises. Noth
ing would benefit them so much as throwing
them open to industrial development. The con
nection between Idleness and mischief ia i,ro- j
verbial, and the opportunity to do remunera-^
tive work is one of the aurest preventives .if ]
war. Of course no business man will aji
the Philippines unless it .8 to his intÂ«"
do so: and it is immensely to the inter
the islands that he should go In. It is -
fore necessary that the Congress shoull
laws by which the resources of the inlands can
be developed; so that franchises (tor limit- a
; terms of years) can be granted to companiei
i doing business in them, Â«nd every encourage
ment be given to the incoming of business men
of every kind.
Not to permit this is to do a wrong to the
Philippines. The franchises must be grant-ii
and the business permitted only under regu
lations which will guarantee the Isla^Js
against any kind of improper exploitation. Bue
the vast natural wealth of the islands mu.-
be developed, and the capital willing to -le
velop it must be given the' opportunity. Tha
field must be thrown open to individual enter
prise, which has been the real factor in the
development of every region over which our
flag has flown. It Is urgently necessary to- en
act suitable laws dealing with general trans
portation, mining-, banking, currency, home
steads, and the use and ownership of the lands
and timber. These laws will give free play
to industrial enterprise: and the commercial
development which will surely follow will af
ford to the people of the islands the best proofs
of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.
NEED OF CABLE
TO THE ORIENT
Not a Day Should Be
Wasted in the Construc
tion of the Cable Line to
Hawaii and the Far Phil
ippines.
I call your attention most earnestly to the
crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the
Philippines, to be continued from the Philip
pines to points In Asia. We should not defer
a day longer than necessary the construction
of such a cable. It is demanded" not merely
for commercial but for political ajid military
considerations.
Either the Congress should immediately pro
vide for the construction of a Government
cable or else an arrangement should be made
by which like advantages to those accruing
from a Government cable may be secured to
the Government by contract with a private
cable company.

No single great material work which' re
mains to be undertaken on this continent Is
of such consequÂ«ncÂ« to the American people
as' the building of a canal across the Isthmus
connecting North and South America. Its Im
portance to the nation is by no. means limited
merely to its material effects upon our busi
ness prosperity; and yet with view tq these
effects alone it' would be to the last degree im
portant for us to immediately begin it. While
its beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific Coast and the gulf
and South Atlantic States, it would also great
ly benefit other sections. It is emphatically
a work which it Is for the Interest of the
entire country to begin and complete as soon
as possible; it ts one of those great works
which only a great nation can undertake with
prospects of success, ana which when done
are not only permanent assets in the nation's
material Interests, but standing monuments to
its constructive ability.

PEACE BEFORE
BLIGHTING WAR
More Harmony Among Civ
ilized Peoples Hoped for
by the Executive of the
American Republic end
Explanation of the Mon
roe Doctrine.
The true end of every great and free people
should be self-respecting peace; and this na
tion most earnestly desires sincere and Â«ordlal
friendship with all others. Over the entire
world, of recent years, wars between the great
civilized powers have become less and less
Irequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-bar
barous peoples come in an entirely different
category, being merely a most regrettable but
necessary international police duty which must
be performed for the sake of the welfare of
mankind. Peace can only be kept witb cer
tainty where both sides wish to keep it; but
more and more the civilized peoples are real
izing the wicked folly of war and are attain
ing that condition of Just and intelligent re
gard for the rights of others which will In
the end, as we hope and believe, make world
wide i>eace possible. The peace conference at
The Hague gave definite expression to this
hope and belief and marked a stride toward
their attainment.
This same peace conference acquiesced in our
Ftatement of the Monroe dictrine as compat
ible with the purposes and aims of the con
ference.
The Monroe doctrine should be the cardinal
feature of the foreign policy of all the nations
of the two Am/rlcas, as it is of the United
States. Just seventy-eight years have passed
since President Monroe in his annual message
announced that '"the American continents are
henceforth not to be considered as subjects
for future colonization by any European
power." In other words, the Monroe doc
trine is a declaration that there must be no
territorial aggrandizement by any non-Ameri
can power at the expense of any American
power on American soil. It is in no wise in
tended as hostile to any nation in the Old
World. Still less is it intended to give cover
to any aggression by one New World power
at the expense of any other. It is simply a
e'ep. and a long step, toward assuring the
universal peace of the world by securing the
possibility of permanent peace on this hemi
sphere.
During the past century other influences have
established the permanence and independence
of the smaller states of Europe. Throush the
Monroe doctrine we hope to be able to safe
puard like Independence and secure like per
manence for the lesser among the New World
nations.
This doctrine has nothing to do â with the
commercial relations of any American power,
Fave that It In truth allows each of them to
form such as it derires. In other words, it is
really a guaranty of the commercial inde
pendence of the Americas. We do not ask
under this doctrine for any exclusive commer
cial dealings with any other American State.
We do not guarantee any State against pun
ishment If it misconducts itself, provided that
punishment does not take the form of the ac
quisition of territory by any non- American
power.
Our attitude in Cuba if a sufficient guaranty
of our own good faith. We have not the slight
est desire to secure any territory at the ex
pense of any of our neighbors. We wish to
work with them hand in hand, so that all of
us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice
over the good fortune of any of them, we gladly
hail their material prosperity and political
stability, and are concerned and alarmed if
any of" them fall into industrial or political
chaos. We do not wish to see any Old World
military power grow up on this continent, or to
be compelled to become a military power our
selves. The peoples of the Americas can pros-
I-er best If left to work out their own salva
tion in their own way.
RIGHTS OURS,
BUT ALSO DUTY
Development of the Navy Is
Required for the Greater
Success of Our Merchant
Marine and for Protection
of the Country.
The work of upbuilding the navy must be
steadily continued. No one point of our policy,
foreign or domestic. Its more Important than
IMS to the honor and material welfare, and
above all to the peace, of our nation in the
future. Whether we desire It or not, we must
henceforth recognize that we have international
duties no less than International rights. Even
if our flas were hauled down In the Philippines
and Porto Rico, even If we decided not to build
the Isthmian canal, we should need a thor
oughly trained navy of adequate size, or else
be prepared definitely and for all time to aban
don the idea that our nation is among those
whose son* go down to the sea. in ships. Un
less our commerce is always to be carried In
foreign bottoms we must have war craft to
protect It.
Inasmuch, however, as the American people
have no thought of abandoning the path upon
which they have entered, and especially In
view of the fact that the building, of the Isth
mian canal Is faet becoming one of the matters
which the whole people are united in demand-
Ing it is Imperative that our navy should be
put* and kept in the highest frtate of efficiency
and should be made to answer to our growing
needs. So far from being In any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly trained
navy is the best guaranty against war, the
cheapest and most effective peace Insurance.
The cost of building and maintaining such a
navy represents the very lightest premium for
Insuring peace which this nation can possibly
pay. *
Probably no other great nation In the world
is 60 anxious for peace as we are. There Is
not a single cix-lllzed power which has anything
â whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our
part. All we want iÂ» peace; and toward this
end we wish to be able to secure the same re
epect for our rights from others which we
ere eager and anxious to extend to their rights
in return, to insure fair treatment to us com
mecially and to guarantee the safety of the
American people.
Our people Intend to abide by the Monioe
' / doctrine and to insist upon It as the one sure
v/A means of securing the peace of the Western
; Hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means
Â»f making our insistence upon the Monroe doer
trine anything but a eubject of derision to
whatever nation chooses to disregard it We
teeire the peace which comes as of right to

________^^_ which will do in de
* "t" fault of any better for
the minor work, and a
proportion of raw men can be mixed
with the highly trained, their short
comlngs^being made good by the skill of their
fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the
navy when pitted against an equal opponent
will be found almost exclusively in the war
ships that have been regularly built and in the
officers and men who through years of faith
ful performance of sea duty have been trained
to handle their formidable but complex and
delicate weapons with the highest efficiency.
In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt
the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had
been launched from two to fourteen years, and
they were able to do as they did because the
men in the conning towers, the gun turrets and
the engine-rooms had through long years of
practice at sea learned how to do their duty.
Our present navy was begun in 1SS2. At that
period our navy consisted of a collection of
antiquated wooden ships, already almost as out
of place against modern war vessels as the gal
leys of Alcibiades and Hamilcarâ certainly as
the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that
time did we have men fit to handle a modern
man-of-war. Under the wise legislation of the
Congress and the successful administration of
a succession of patriotic Secretaries of the
Navy, belonging to both political parties, the
work of upbuilding the navy went on, and
ships equal to any In the world of their kind
were continually added; and what was even
more Important, these ships were exercised at
sea singly and in squadrons until the men
aboard them were able to get the best possible
service out of them. The result was seen in
the short war with Spain, which was decided
with such rapidity because of the Infinitely
greater preparedness of our navy than of the
Spanish navy.
While awarding the fullest honor to the men
who actually commanded and manned the ships
which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the
Philippines and in Cuba, we must not forget
that an equal meed of praise belongs to those
without whom neither blow could have been
struck. The Congressmen who voted years in
advance the money to lay down the ships, to
build the guns, to buy the armcr-plate; the de-
I partment officials and the business* men and
wage-workers who furnished what the Con
gress had authorized; the Secretaries of the
Navy who asked for and expended the appro
priations; and finally the officers who, in fair
weather and foul, on actual sea service, trained
and disciplined the crews of the ships when
there was no war In sightâ all are entitled to a
full share in the glory of Manila and Santiago,
and the respect accorded by every true Ameri
can to those who wrought such signal triumph
for our country- It was forethought and prep
aration which secured us the overwhelming tri
umph of 1S9S. If we fall to show forethought
and preparation now, there may come a time
when disaster will befall us instead of tri
umph; and should this time come, the fault
will rest primarily, not upon those whom the
accident of events puts in supreme command
at the moment, but upon those who have failed
to prepare in advance. â _
There should be no
â¦ â¦ cessation in the work
j of completing our navy.

unsafe and unwise not
to provide this year for several additional bat
tleships and heavy armored cruisers, with aux
iliary and lighter craft in proportion; for the
exafct numbers and character I refer you to the
report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there
is something we need even more than addi
tional ships, and this is additional officers and
men. To provide battleships and cruisers and
then lay them up, with the expectation of leav
ing them unmanned until they are needed in
actual war, would be worse than folly; it
would be a crime against the nation.
To send any warship against a competent
enemy unless those aboard it have been trained
by years of actual sea service. Including in
cessant [junnery practice, would be to Invite
not merely dlnsaster, but the bitterest shame
and humiliation. Four thousand additional
seamen and one thousand additional marines
should be provided; and an increase in the offi
cers should be provided by making a large ad
dition to the classes at Annapolis. There is
one small matter which should be mentioned
in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious
and unmeaning ..title of "naval cadet" sh 1
be abolished; the title of "midshipman," lull
of historic association, should be restored.
Even In time of peace a warship should be
used until It wears out, for only so can .it be
kept fit to respond to any emergency. The
officers and men alike should be kept as much
as possible on blue water, for it is there only
they can learn their, duties as they should be
learned. The big vessels should be maneuvered
In squadrons containing not merely battleships,
but the necessary proportion of% cruisers and
scouts. The torpedo-boats' should be handled
by the younger officers in such manner as will*
best fit the latter to take responslbllty and
meet the emergencies of actual warfare.
Every detail ashore which can be performed
by a civilian should be so performed, the offi
cer being kept for his special duty in the sea
service. Above all, gunnery practice should be
unceasing. It is Important to have our navy
of adequate size, but it Is even more important
that ship for ship It ehould equal In efficiency
any navy in the world. This is possible only
with highly drilled crews and officers, and this
In turn imperatively demands continuous and
progressive Instruction in target practice, ship
handling, squadron tactics and general discip
line. Our ships must be assembled In squad-'
rons actively cruising away from harbors and
never long at anchor. The resulting wear upon
engines and hulls must be endured; a battle
ship worn out In long training of officers and
men is well paid for by the results, while, on
the other hand, no matter in how excellent
condition. It Is useless If the crew be not ex
pert.
We now have seven

it + but it will take at least
that time to recruit'
and train the men to fight them. It is of vast
concern that we have trained crews ready for
the vessels by the time they are commissioned.
Good ships and good guns are simply good
weapons, and the best weapons are useless
save In the hands of men who know how to
fight with them. The men must be trained and
drilled under a thorough and well-planned sys
tem of progressive instruction, while the re
cruiting must be carried on with still greater
vigor. Every effort must be made to exalt the
main function of the officer â the command of
men. The leading graduates of the Naval Acad
emy should be assigned to the combatant
branches, the line and marines. Â£
Many of the essentials of success are already
recognized by the general board, which, as the
central office of a growing staff, is moving
steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a
proper efficiency of the whole navy, under the
Secretary. This general board, by fostering
the creation of a general staff, is providing
for the official and then the general recogni
tion of our altered conditions as a nation and
of the true meaning of a great war fleet, which
meaning is. first, the best men, and, second,
the best ships.
The Naval Militia forces are State organiza
tions, and are trained for coast service, and
in event of war they will constitute the inner
line of defense. They ehould receive hearty
encouragement from the General Government.
But in addition - we should at once provide
for a national naval reserve, organized and
trained under the direction of the Navy De
partment, and subject to. the call of the Chief
Executive whenever war becomes Imminent.
It should be a real auxiliary to the naval sea
going peace establishment, and offer material
to be drawn on at once for manning our ebipu

ARMED FORCES
ARE ADEQUATE
. â  i
No Important Reason Exists
at the Present Time for
Increase in the Strength of
the Military Organisation
of the Country. /...
It is not necessary to increase our army be
yond its present size at this time. ' But it is
necessary to keep it at the highest point of
efficiency. The individual units who as officers
and enlisted men compose this army, are, we
have good reason to believe, at least as â  effi
cient as those of any other army In the entire
world. It is our. duty to see that their train
ing is of a kind to Insure the highest possible
expression of power to these units when act
ing in combination.
The conditions of modern 'war are â  such as
to make an infinitely heavier demand than
ever before upon the individual character and
capacity of the officer and' the enlisted man,
and to make It' far more difficult for men to
act together with effect. At present the fight
ing must be done in extended order, > which
means that each man must . act for himself
and at the same time act In combination with
others with whom he is no longer in the old
fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such
conditions a few men of the highest excellence
are worth more than many men without the
special skill which is only found as the result
of special training applied i to men of excep
tional physique and morale. But nowadays
the most valuable fighting man and the most
difficult to perfect is the rifleman who is also
a skillful and daring rider.
The proportion of our cavalry regiments has
wisely been Increased. The American cavalry
man, trained to maneuver and fight with equal
facility Tin foot and on horseback, is the best
type of soldier for i general â .. purposes â  now to
be found In the world. â¢ The Ideal cavalryman
of , the present day is a njan who can fight : on
foot : as effectively as . the best , infantryman."
and who Is In addition unsurpassed in tho care
and management of his horse and in his abil
ity to fight on horseback.
A general staff ehould be created. As for the
present staff and supply departments, they
should be filled by details from the line, the
men so detailed returning after a while to
their line duties. It Is very undesirable to have
the senior grades of the army composed of
men who have come to fill the positions by,
the mere fact of seniority. A system' should
be adopted by which there shall be an elimina
tion, grade by grade, of those who seem un
fit to render the best service in the next grade.
Justice to the veterans of the civil war who
are still in the 'army would seem to require'
that in the matter of retirements they be given
by Jaw the same privileges accorded to their
comrades in the navy.
The process of elim
\4 â 4- lnatlon of the least fit
I should be conducted in
Good, of the I a manner that would
service mnÂ»t ) render it practically
always b,e the | impossible to apply'
purnin o' u n t j political or social pres
consideratlon | sure on behalf of any
| candidate, so that each
f f man may \be judged
purely on his own mer
its. Pressure for the promotion of civil offi
cials for political reasons is bad enough, but
it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf
of officers of the army or navy. Every pro
motion and every detail under the War De
partment must be made solely with regard to
the good of the service and to the capacity
and merit of the man hlntself. No pressure,
political, â¢ social . or personal, of any. kind, will
be permitted to exercise the least effect in any
question of promotion or detail; and if there
U reason to believe that such pressure is ex
ercised at the Instigation of the officer con-,
cerned, it will be held to militate against him.
In our army we cannot afford to have rewards
or duties distributed save on the simple. ground
that those ,who by their own merits are en
titled to the rewards get them, and that those
who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are
chosen to perform them.
Every effort should be made to bring the
army to a constantly increasing state of effi
ciency. Wlten on actual service no work save
that directly in line of such service should be
required. The paper work in the army, as in
the navy, should . be greatly reduced. What
is needed is . proved power of . command and
capacity to work well in the field. Constant
care is necessary to j prevent dry, rot in. the
transportation and commissary departments.
Our army Is so small and so much scattered
that it is very difficult to give the higher offi
cers (as â  well ' as the. lower officers and the
enlisted men) a chance to practice maneuvers
in mass and on a comparatively . large scale.
In time of need no amount of Individual'excel
lence would avail against tfre paralysis which
would follow inability to > work as a coherent
whole ' under and daring leadership.'
The Congress should provide means* whereby it
will be possible to have field exercises by at
least a division of regulars and if possible also
a division of national guardsmen once 'a year
These ' exercises 'â¢ might take the. form of field
maneuvers.' or, if on the Gulf Coast or the Pa
cific or Atlantic seaboard, or in the region of
â¢ â  *
the Great Lakes, the army corps when as
sembled could be marched from some inland
point to some point on the water, there em
barked, disembarked after a couple of days'
journey at some other point and again marched
inland. Only by actual handling and providing
for men In masses while they are marching,
camping, embarking and disembarking will it
be possible to train. the higher officers to per
form their duties well and smoothly.
A great debt is owing
4 1- from the public to tho
j men of the army and
Public owes a navy. They should be
gr r e a t debt so treated as to enable
to the â¢ army them to reach the
\, and to* the highest point of effl
navy. | ciency, so that they
' I may be able to respond
\ 4" Instantly to any de
mand made upon them
to sustain the Interests of the nation and the
Jionor of . the flag. The individual American
enlisted man is probably on the whole a more
formidable fighting man than the regular of
any other army. Every consideration should
be shown him and in return the highest stand
ard of usefulness' should be exacted from him.
It is well worth while for the Congress to con
sider â¢ whether the pay of enlisted men upon
second and subsequent enlistments should not
be increased to correspond with the increased
value of the veteran soldier.
Much good has already come from the act
reorganizing the army passed early in the pres
ent year. The three prime reforms, all of them
of : literally inestimable value, are, first, the
substitution of four-year details from the line
for permanent appointments in the so-called
staff divisions; second, the establishment of a
corps of artillery with a chief at the head;
third, the establishment of a maximum - and
minimum limit for. the army. It would be
difficult to overestimate the improvement in the
efficiency of our army which these three re
forms are making and have In part already
effected.
The reorganization provided for by the act
has been substantially accomplished. The Im
proved . conditions In the Philippines have â¢ en
abled the War Department materially to reduce
the military charge upon our revenue and to
arrange, the number of soldiers so as to bring

Action should be taken in reference to tha
militia and to the raising of volunteer forces.
Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. - The
organization and armament of the National
Guard of the several States, which are treated
as militia in the appropriations by the Congress,
should be made identical with those provided
for the regular forces. The, obligations and
duties of the guard in time of war should be
carefully defined and a system established by
law under which the method of procedure of
raising volunteer forces should be prescribed
in advance. . It is utterly impossible In the
excitement and haste of impending war to do
this satisfactorily if the arrangements have
not been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilizing In the first vol
unteer organizations called out the training of
those citizens who have already had experience
under arms, and especially for the selection in
advance of the officers of any force which may
be raised: for careful selection of the kind
necessary Is Impossible ' after the outbreak of
war.
That the army is not at all a mere Instru
ment of destruction has been shown during the
last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba and
Porto Rico it has proved itself a great con
structive force, a most potent Implement for
th-> upbuilding of a peaceful civilisation.
No other citizens deserve so well of the re
public as the veterans, the survivors of those
who saved the Union. They did the one deed
which if left undone would have meant that
all else in our history went for nothing. But
for their steadfast prowess In the greatest
crisis of our history all our annals would be
meaningless and our great experiment in pop
ular freedom and self-government a glpomy
failure. . Moreover, they not only left? us a
united nation, but they left us also as a her
itage the memory of the mighty deeds by
which the nation was kept united. We are
now indeed one nation, one In fact as well
as in name; we are united in our devotion to
the flag which Is the symbol of national great
ness and unity; and the very completeness of
our union enables us all, in every part of the
country, to glory In the valor shown alike by
the sons of the North and the sons of the
South In the times that tried men's souls.
The men who in the last three years have
done so well in the East and the West Indies
and on the mainland of Asia have shown that
this remembrance is not lost. In any serious
crisis the United States must rely for the
great mass of its fighting men upon the vol
unteer soldiery who do not make a permanent
profession of the military career; and when
ever such a crisis arises the deathless memo
ries of the Civil War will give to Americans
the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those
whose fathers have stood valiantly in the
forefront of the battle.
MERIT SYSTEM
SHOWS CAINS
Government â  Has Greatly
Benefited by the Practice
Which Permits Only Per
sons of Ability to Occupy
the Federal Positions.
The merit system of making appointments
is In Its essence as democratic and American
as the common school system ! itself. It sim
ply means that in clerical and other positions
where the duties are entirely non-political all
applicants should have a fair field and no fa
vor, each standing on his merits as he is able
to show them by practical test. Written com
petitive examinations offer the only available
means in many cases for applying this sys
tem. In other cases, as where laborers ! are
employed, a system of registration undoubted
ly can be widely â  extended. There are of
course, places â¢ where the written, competitive
examination cannot be applied, and others
where it offers by no means an ideal solu
tion, but where under existing political con
ditions it is, though an imperfect means, yet
the best present means of getting satisfactory
results. â 
Wherever the conditions have permitted the
application of the merit system in its fullest
and widest sense, the* rain to the Government
has been immense. The navy-yards and pos
tal service Illustrate, probably better than any
other branches of the Government, the great
gain in economy, efficiency and honesty due
to the enforcement of this principle.
I recommend the pdssape of a law which
will extend the classified service to the Dis
trict of Columbia, or will at least enable tho
President thus to extend It. In my Judgment
all laws providing for the temporary employ
ment of clerks should hereafter contain a pro
vision that they be selected under the Civil
Service law.
' It is lmr>ortant to have this system obtain
at home, but it is even more important' to
have it applied rigidly in our insular posses
sions. Not an office should be filled In the
Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to
the man's partisan affiliations or services,
with any regard to the political, social or per
sonal influence which he may have at his
command; in short, heed .should be paid to
absolutely nothing save the man's own char
acter and capacity and the - needs of the
service.
The administration of these islands should
be as wholly free from the suspicion of par
tisan politics as the administration of the
army and navy. AH that we ask from the
public servant in the Philippines or Porto
Rico Is that he reflect- honor on his country
by the way in which he nrakes that country's
rule a benefit to the peoples who have come
under it. This Is all that we should ask. and
we cannot afford to be content with less.
The merit system Is simply one method of
securing honest and efficient administration of
the Government: and in the long run the sole
justification of any type of government lies
in its provins itself both honest and efficient.
The consular service Is now organized under
the provisions of a law passed in 1856, which
is entirely Inadequate to existing, conditions.
The Interest shown by so many commercial
bodies throughout the country In the reorgan
ization of the service is heartily commended
to your attention. Several bills providing for
a new consular service have in recent years
been submitted to the Congress. They are based
upon the Just principle that appointments to
the service should be made only after a prac
tical test of the applicant's fitness, that pro
motions should be governed by trustworthiness,
adaptability and I zeal in the performance of
duty, and that the tenure of office should be

unaffected by partisan considerations.
The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly
expanding? foreign commerce, the protection of
American citizens resorting to foreign coun
tries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the
maintenance of the dignity of the nation
abroad, combine to make It essential that our
Consuls should be men of character, knowledge
and enterprise. It Is true that the service is
now, in the main, efficient, but a standard
of excellence cannot be permanently maintained
until the principles set forth In the bills here
tofore submitted to the Congress on this sub
ject are enacted Into law.
In my : judgment the tima has arrived -when
we should definitely make up our minds to rec
ognize the Indian as an individual and not as
a member of a tribe. The general allotment
act Is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up
the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the fam
ily and the individual. Under its provisions
some 60.CG0 Indians have already become citi
zens of the United States. "We should notr
break up the tribal funds, doing for them whnt
allotment does for the tribal lands; that U\
tffcy should be divided Into Individual holdlngrf-
There win be a transition period during whic*>
the funds will in many cases have to be held
In trust. This Is the case also with the lands.
A stop should be put upon the indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allotments.
The effort ishould be steadily to make the In
dian work like any other man on - his own
jrround. The marriage laws oS the Indiana
should be made the same as those of the
whites.
In the schools the education should be ele
mentary and largoly industrial. The need of
higher education among the Indians Is very,
very limited. On the reservations care should
be taken to try to suit the teaching to the
needs of the particular Indian. There Is no
use In attempting to Induce agriculture In a
country suited only for cattle raising, where
the Indian should be made a stock grower.
The ration system, which is merely the corral
and the reservation system. Is highly detrimen
tal to the Indians. It promotes beggary, per
petuates pauperism and stifles industry. It Is
an effectual barrier to progress. It must, con
tinue to a greater or less degree as long as
tribes are herded on reservations and" have
everything In common. The Indian should be
treated as an Individualâ like the white man.
During the change of treatment Inevitable
hardships will occur: every effort should be
made to minimize these hardships; but we
should not because of them hesitate to make
the change. There should be a continuous re
duction In the number of agencies.
In dealing with the aboriginal races few
things are more important than to preserve
them from the terrible physical and moral
degradation resulting fÂ«om the liquor traffic.
We are doing all we can to save our own In
dian tribes from this evil. Wherever by Inter
national agreement this same end can be at
tained as regards races where we do not pos
sess exclusive control every effort should be.
made to bring It about.

I bespeak the most cordial support from the
Congress and the people for the St. Louis Ex
position to commemorate the one hundredth
anniversary of the Louisiana purchase. This
purchase was the greatest instance of expan
sion in our history. It definitely decided that
we were to become a great continental repub
lic, by far the foremost power In the Western
Hemisphere. It is one of three or four, great
landmarks In our historyâ the great turning
points in our development. It is eminently fit
ting that all our people should Join "with
heartiest good will In commemorating It. and
the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all
the adjacent region are entitled to every aid
in making ttte celebration a noteworthy event
In our annals. We earnestly hope that foreign
nations will appreciate the deep interest our
country takes in this exposition and our view
of its importance from every standpoint, and
that they will participate in securing its suc
cess. The national Government should be rep
resented by a full and complete set of exhibits.
The people of Charleston, with great energy
and civic spirit, are carrying on an exposition
which will continue throughout most of tha
present session of the Congress. I heartily
commend this exposition to the good will of
the people. It deserves all the encouragement
that can be given It. The managers of' tho
Charleston Exposition' have feq*uested the-
Cabinet officers to-' place therear the Govern
ment exhibits which have been at Buffalo,
promising to pay the necessary expenses. I
have taken the responsibility of directing that
this be done, for I feel that It is due to
Charleston to help her In her praiseworthy ef
fort. In my opinion the management shoull
not be required to pay all the expenses. I
earnestly recommend that the Congress appro
priate at once the small sum necessary for tola
purpose.
The Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo lias
Just closed. Both from the industrial and the
artistic standpoint this exposition has been lit
a high degree creditable and useful, not mere
ly to Buffalo, but to the United States., Tho
terrible tragedy of the President's assassina
tion interefered materially with its being a
financial success. The exposition was pecu
liarly In harmony with the trend of our pub
lic policy, because . it represented an effort to
bring Into closer touch all the peoples of the
Western Hemisphere, and give them an In
creasing sense of unity. Such an effort was
a genuine service to the entire American pub

FOUND AT LAST.
EVER since the collapse of Bryanism and
free silver the Democratic organs and lead
ers have been searching for a new is
sue and a new man. The search has been
conducted with varying degrees of sagacity and
folly, but without avail. The wise men have been
no more successful than the fools. Now at last there
comes from the Hearst papers a sudden shout that
an issue has been found. No more free silver, no
more Bryan, no anti-government-by-injunction, no
more cry of anti-imperialism. The new issue is to be
the whole thing. "Let Democracy," said the Exam
iner of yesterday, "forget its quarrels over dead Js-.
sues, close its ranks and move forward to a victory
all the more welcome for being so long desired."
â¢ Strangely enough, the new issue has been furnished
by the Supreme Court. It was but a little while ago
the Bryanites were denouncing the Supreme Court
as an agejicy of plutocratic control and an enemy of
liberty. The acceptance, therefore, of a Supreme
Court decision as an illumination and an electric
thrill by the Bryanites is really a novelty. The party
was dying amid its dead issues, but now it is alive,
and lo! it was the Supreme Court that did the en
livening. Here is new politics indeed.
The explanation of the paradox of a Bryanite*bel
lowing for the Supreme Court is simple. The court
has decided that until Congress provide otherwise
the Philippines are to have full freedom of trade with
the United States. They can ship to our markets
their fruit, rice, hemp, sugar and other products with
out paying customs duties. The American producer
will have to compete with that cheap labor and find
no protection. Over that situation the Examiner
gloats. It says: "We have free trade with the Phil
ippines. All we have to do is to keep it."
Warming with enthusiasm the Bryanite organ urges
Democrats in Congress to resist any attempt at tariff
legislation for the Philippines. It cries in big type:
'The court's decision has given Democracy the op
portunity of its life."
Many a fool dog has barked. up the wrong tree, so
the Examiner is not without a predecessor to serve as
i model for its uproar over the new issue. About the
rime the Southern Bryanites get a fair kick at the new
jolicy, -however, it will be sent clean out of camp.
The Democrats of South Carolina, Georgia and Louis
ana are not eager for free trade with countries
vhere rice, sugar, tropic fruits, hemp and other ar
acles of Southern production can be produced
:heaper than the South can produce them. It is true
he Southern Democrats for many a year have been
tlamorous for free trade, but with them it meant
nainly free trade in manufactured goods. It no
onger means so much as that, for the South has
>egun manufacturing. The fate of the Wilson tariff
>ill shows what Southern Democrats think of free
rade in these days. They_ have -had- the experiment
mce, and they are not going to try it again in a
lurry. >;i".- y
In addition to the Southern vote there is the labor
â¢ote to be taken into consideration. How will the
rorkingmen-of California enthuse - in support of a
trogrammejthat will expose them to the competi
ion of the cheap and pauperized labor of the Philip
tines? With, what success will the Bryanites attempt
o rally the iworkingmen in support of a platform
ailing for "free trade and cheap labor"?
The Hearst paper may for a time cackle and crow
Â«ver the new issue, but by and by it will cease to be
: novelty, and then there will be another call to the
Â«arty to leave dead issues and^o forward to some
hing new. The Supreme Court decision seems to
ave galvanized Democracy into a sudden spasm,' but

THERE is no pageantry atfout the opening ; of Congress, except as philosophy
may see pomp in simplicity.- The London' Lord 'Mayor's show is a tinseled spec
tacle,, and the opening of foreign Parliaments is a bravely bannered function, but
an American Congress comes from the people to its' first assembly with no other
display than the friendly greeting between members, just as neighbors hail each other on
town market days. When the greetings even suspend the legal formalities with which the
business begins, and the drawing for seats resembles more the counting off by. t a lot of
schoolboys than anything else, the citizen looking on from the gallery would feel no sur
prise if this proceeding were conducted by the Speaker counting off by rigmarole "onery
on-ickeny-and," the lucky one being "It" for first choice of seats.;."
The appearance of the President's message, like all the rest, is a simple affair. This
was first called ."The President's Speech," and Washington attended the first Congress in
person and made his speech. Of course this was in analogy of the King's speech vto his
Parliament. This method was soon abandoned and the President's message came, to be'
written out in long hand, to be read to each house separately. President Roosevelt has
madean. innovation by 'delivering it in print. .
The interest in this last message has been heightened by the circumstances en
meshing the President. ' Of strong personality trained^in executive functions, a writer
more copious than any other public man in our. history, he is on record in his histories,
biographies, narratives and essays. He has written upon nearly every major public ques
tion, but let no man think that he will change any positive expression of opinion without
adequate reason, or without stating that reason in justification of his attitude.' Nor, let
any man expect any pointed dissent from that reason by any of his thoughtful country
men, who are the final cause of that public opinion which rules the republic. ."
His first message has the merit of being interesting reading. There is not a par
tisan expression in it, but it discusses the public welfare "' and the state of the Union from
the standpoint of a clear-headed, self-centered American, called to supreme responsibility
and not afraid of himself nor of his countrymen. His review of the life of his predecessor
is so planned as to be a eulogy and an essay on economics, and is already a classic in
the catalogue of official threnodies. , . .
His recommendations in restraint of anarchy have the merit of moderation and
effectiveness, and are respectful of the lawful rights of all men. His discussion of the
combinations of capital is in line with his Minneapolis speech. To show that he has no
sympathy with the reckless rooters on this subject, he points out this great truth which
is unchangeable: "In accordance with a well-known sociological law the ignorant or reck
less agitator has been really the effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally
opposing. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies
of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent
and in what manner it is practical to apply remedies."
He would restrain overcapitalization and compel publicity of corporations, because
by investing in the stocks of their combinations the public furnishes the capital upon
which they do business. This system being already in operation in the public oversight
of national banks, its application to all combinations engaged in interstate trade is easy
and natural. * .
The recommendation of a new Cabinet officer, to be Secretary of Commerce and
Industries, is in line with public expectation, and if Congress do not immediately provide
for it, it should incubate such a department by creating it as a bureau, following the ex
ample set in the evolution of the Interior and the Agricultural ' departments from such
bureaus. He strikes the popular chord in recommending such change in our immigra
tion as willshut out about two-thirds of our present foreign immigration. We are re
ceiving the indigence and disease of Europe. Let our laws admit only prosperity and
health.
The reform in banking to accommodate the, needs of the country by enabling an
emergency currency is recommended on the lines often stated in The Call.
The President is at Jiome in discussing the Western problems of irrigation and
forest preservation. His observation of detail is shown In his statement of the effects of
over-grazing on the public domain, even down to noting the especial destruction
wrought by sheep in a dry country. . ,, - -u^ . ;
In insular matters he reflects a popular hope rather than' a physical possibility in
looking forward to the population of Hawaii by American homesteaders and prosperity
following the exclusion of coolie labor. Our attitude toward the Filipinos is declared to
be pedagogic, leading them up the strong path to self-government, but whether as citi-
zens of American States or not is not specified.
Civil service is bluntly and unequivocally favored, and in our island possessions is
regarded as imperative, no discrimination to be permitted on account of party affilia
tions. Extension of the classified-service is foreshadowed, and 'â¢â  the country; may expect
that the field uncovered by President McKinley will soon be included again, even be
yond the frontier to which Mr. Cleveland aimed.
These are the principal points in a message that never loses its outspoken frank
ness and its breezy tone. There is in it an indescribable , zest and an infusion of the youth,
optimism and the experience of its author, which gives it a place by itself in the line of
Presidential messages. It will be read through by more people than ever before read an
entire message. It holds out hope and support for Ihose who would recreate our mer
chant marine, for the protected interests struggling into strength, for l.abor looking for
security of its foothold, for commerce measuring itself with the world, andfor manhood
that stands upon its own feet and turns its forehead to the stars.
NO NEED FOR A FIGHT.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has virtually taken
charge of the movement to bring about the re
enactment of the Chinese exclusion law so
amended as to make it better and more effective.
Our information from Washington further assures
us that the President has the support of an over
whelming majority in Congress. The passage of an
amended and improved act of exclusion is therefore
certain.
In his message the President says: "Not only
must our labor be protected by a tariff, but it should
also be protected as far as it is possible from the pres
ence in this country of any laborers brought over by
contract, or any of those who coming freely yet repre
sent a standard of living so depressed that they can
undersell our men in the labor market and drag them
to a lower level: I regard it as necessary, with this
end in view, to re-enact immediately the law exclud
ing Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever
necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely
effective."
Our dispatches from Washington announce that
&o far as the poll of Congressmen on the subject has
been carried only one man has been found. opposed
to the'exclusion act. The matter has been placed in
charge of Mr. Powderly, Commissioner of Immi
gration, and he is now in consultation with the Cali
fornia delegation and others for the purpose of de
v'ising an act which will be thoroughly satisfactory
in every respect.
This news will be gratifying to nearly everybody in-
California, and especially will it be gratifying to the
gentlemen who at. a meeting last evening were ap
pointed, a committee to collect, money to make the
fight and to send a delegation to Washington to look
after the contest there. That committee will not
have to go to the trouble of passing the hat. No
money is needed, no committee is needed. The bat
tle has been won and the fight is ended.
The only class of people who will regret the sud
den ending of the excitement on the subject will be
the politicians who hoped to make political capital
out of it and to pose before the public as defenders
of labor. The saddest of all will be the committee
that expectedto be sent. to Washington at the ex
pense of a popular subscription.- Their dream .of â  a ;

junket is over. All that is left them is their commis
sion signed by Governor Gage. That can be handed
down to their posterity as evidence of a greatness that
"might have been." .The California delegation in
Congress can look after the interests of, the â¢ State
without the help of any such committee, and the peo
ple who would have been induced to contribute to
defraying the cost of the committee can keep the
money for Christmas gifts. Despite- the disappoint
ment of the committee and the politicians the issue is
one for general congratulation. All's well that ends
well.
By the way in which the New York papers' re
ported the speeches at the banquet given to Joseph
H. Choate, we can estimate the extent to which some
former great men- have faded.' Choate's speech of
course received the largest space, next came that of
Carnegie, Mark Twain was third in honors, Tom
Reed who preceded him was given three lines, and
then the 1 reports concluded: "Senator Depew, Wil
liam B. Homblower and" Judge Howland followed
Mark Twain." Giving Tom Reed so small a space is
bad enough, but to cut Depew .down to a bare.men
tion is a clear case of cruelty. f
According to a theory now being discussed , in
scientific circles the ice cap upon the south pole has

Ranged around the large hall were
magnificent specimens of citrus and dried
fruits. These came from all parts of the
State and each one bore the name of the
exhibitor. . They were carefully examined
and their various qualities freely com
mented upon and discussed.
Elwood Cooper of Santa Barbara, chair
man of the State Fruit Growers* Conven
tion, called the meeting to order. Rev.
J C Adams said a short prayer. Profes
sor E. J; Wickson of the State Univer
sity was elected vice chairman.
Mayor James D. Phelan was introduced
to deliver the address of welcome. Ho
referred to the fact that while San Fran
cisco could not boast, of her horticultural
development, still each year an. immense
quantity of fruit is handled here. Con
tinuing, the Mayor said;
There ought to be a great market for Cali
fornia tfru its in Europe. A short time ago
I had to pay a franc ana a hair for a peach
In a hotel in Paris. There ought to be a gold
mine for qallfornla growers who ship their
fruits to Europe.
Competes in Markets of Spain.
Mayor Phelan read from consular re
ports showing that California fruit was
competing in the markets of Valencia,
Spain, with fruit grown in the immediate
vicinity of that city. He.. .thought the
construction of the Nicaragua canal
would be of Immense benefit to the State
and would materially aid' the fruit indus
try. The Mayor was given a rising vote
of thanks when he concluded.
President Ellwood Cooper read his an
nual address, saying in part: i
Greater prosperity exists than has existed
for many years. Deciduous fruits and oranges
have sold well. Lemons were depressed through
excessive importation. Prunes and raialns have
not been well marketed. The question of mar
keting fruit is the most important befora the
fruit rrowers. .
The expense of removing: pests, is very great,
and is likely to be a perpetual tax on the in
dustry. If, however, we combat noxious in
sects by their natural enemies we may find a
good and cheap solution of tnis great . problem.
The pure food laws ought to be strictly en
forced.-These laws should be revised and a
mode devised for sampling foods, detecting vio
lation of the law. and punishing offenders. ;
; I recommend that we pass a, resolution to be
sent to CongrefS declaring that we. oppose any
reduction, by reciprocity or otherwise, in â¢ the
tariff on fruits and fruit- products, and that
we favor an lnteroceanlc canal. -We should
endpavcr to procure an appropriation of $10, OW
for the investigation of parasites and fruit
pests:: . . â 
, A. H.' Naftzger. B.. N. Rowley, E. J.
Wickson, H. P. Stabler and \V. J. Hotch
klss were appointed a committee to con
sider the recommendations of the presi
dent. â¢
William H. Mills, who was to deliver
an address â¢ on his impressions of the
Pan-American Exposition, was absent.
The report of the'"' California Fruit
Growers' Association was read by Pro
fessor â  Wickson, owing to the inability -of
H.-E. Weinstock, the president, the at
tend. â â It' dealt with matters of transpor
tation and the extent of the various crops
and concluded with the. folio wing sum
mary: â  ' . , ' . Â»â / ; ./. -
' On the whole, this baa been one of the most
favorable years in the history of the Califor
nia fruit Industry. The results cannot but
have added very much to the value of Califor
nia fruit lands and to have Inspired the fruit
growew with renewed courage and hope in the
future.
With the growing experience and higher
judgment that is belnsr exercised on the part of
the grower in the planting, cultivating, har
vesting, packing- and the marketing of his
crop, the outlook was never brighter for thi
future of the California green fruit industry.
Papers relating to the distribution,
transportation, marketing, of fruits and
fruit products consumed the greater por
tion of the afternoon session,
"Distribution of Fruits" was the sub
ject of an address read by A. H. Naftz
ger of Los Angeles, president and gen
eral manager of the Southern California
Citrus Fruit Association. He said that
the average cost to the grower who ship
pod fruit through that association. In
cluding, all charges, did not exceed 3 per
cent from th# time the fruit was placed
on the , cars. This included a monthly
payroll to employes of the association of
57000. He urged growers of other fruits
to combine in the same way.
"The Deciduous Fruit Outlook In the
San Joaquin Valley" was the subject dis
cussed in a paper presented by I. H.
Thomas and read by E. J. Wickson.
Vi\ H. Aiken, who lives in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, gave an interesting his
tory of the prune and methods of culture
in his paper, "The Outlook for the Prune
Industry."
Future Trade Possibilities.
Isador Jacobs read a well considered pa
per on "Future Trade Possibilities in
Canned and Dried Fruits." He showed
the necessity of maintaining a high stand
ard in all goods shipped to Eastern and
foreign markets.
In the discussion which followed E. Ber
wick provided a small sensation by at
tacking the San Francisco commission
merchants. He said some years ago they
charged 8 per cent for handling fruit, and
this year arbitrarily raised their commis
sion to 10 per cent. He asked that the
convention condemn this action. A long
discussion followed. Most of the mem
bers were opposed to such radical action,
and a compromise was effected by â¢ the
appointment of a committee of three to
investigate the conditions governing itie
commission market in San Francisco and
report 'jack to the convention. The chair
named A. R. Sprague of Sacramento, F.
N. Righter of Campbells and Chauncey
iSaines 6t Fresno.
The resort of the committee on fruit
packages, recommending a (standard size
for 25 and 50 "pound boxes, was read by
Profes3or Wickson and adopted.
Favor Nicaragua^ Canal.
E. Berwick read the report of the com
mittee on foreign consular advices and
detailed the work so far accomplished by
E. F. Adams and Eugene Goodwin of the
Pacific Commercial Museum,. who had the
matter in charge.
The. committee on Nicaragua canal of
fered the following resolution, which was
unanimously adopted :
Resolved, That this State Convention- of

The convention will meet this morning
at 9:30 o'clock and will be addressed by
Mr. Goodwin on the work of the Pacific

will be delivered by T. N. Woods, A. K.

MENACE OF ITEAK. BLIGHT.
Horticultural Commissioners and
â¢ Fruit Men Discuss Measures
for Its Extermination.
"Pear Blight" was the subject discussed
at the meeting of the State Board of Hor
ticultural Commissioners held last night
at Pioneer Hall. 11. "W". Motherall of
Kings County acted as chairman and
George H. Cutter of Sacramento as tem
porary secretary.. Chairman Motherall
opened the discussion by relating hia ex
perience with the parasite that has been
devastating the pear trees. The particu
lar parasite is said to be one of vegetable
origin, which produces a sweet-tasting
excretion very much fancied by bees and
carried by them Into the opening blossoms
of the pear tree. He told of the efforts of
the orchardists to stamp out the pests and
the means that had been adopted tÂ« ex
terminate the bees, which are In thi3 in
stance regarded as trespassers upon the
orchards. He said the beekeepers had been
notified to keep their bees at home, and
that if they did not they would find their
honey crop very short.
In the discussion which followed A. D.
Pryal of Alameda County, I. N. Clark of
Lompoc, Professor C. "W". "Woodworta of
the department of entomology of the Uni
versity of California and members of the
fruit-growers' convention who were pres
ent by invitation participated. The whole
field cf fruit pests was considered during
the discussion.
â¢ C. M. Heintz, editor of the Rural Cali
fornlan of Los Angeles, brought up the
question of spraying? citrus fruit trees
with distillates, claiming that it worked

Arrives From Eastern Waters.
pT-j^HE Toyo Kisen Kaisha's Nippon
II Maru arrived from, and the Oc-
I cidental arid Oriental Company's
1L Doric sailed for the Orient yester-
day. Bishop Partridge and his
bride sailed for the Orient on the Doric.
A crowd of church people was down to see
them off and rice and old slippers wero
showered after the vessel as she pulled
awav from the wharf. The strains of
the hymn, "God Be With You Till We
Meet Again," sung by a choir of young
people, followed the newly wedded couple
as the Doric headed down the stream.
The cabin passengers who went away
on th'e Doric are :
For Yokohamaâ Emile Adet. J. Brett, Mrs. J.
Brett, Miss J. N. Crosby, Miss C. D. LoomlÂ».

The Nippon Maru did not bring a great
crowd of passengers. She was nearly
twenty-nine days making the run from
Yokohama, but was only five days, twen
ty-two hours and a few minutes coming
from Honolulu. She brought up fifty
cabin and eleven second cabin, besides
seventy-eight Chinese passengers. Those
who came up in the cabin were:
Rev. J. M. Alexander and wife. Miss Alex
ander, Miss Bacon, J. Becker, Georee S.
Beebe, "Captain F. W. Bunner, F. H. Callun

The Nippon Maru did not reach her
dock until after 2 p. m. In the meantime
Dr. Kinyoun was taken off in the quar
antine launch and landed on Angel Isl
and, while the remainder of the passen
gers had to wait. It Is said the doctor has
been studying the plague bacillus in the
Orient and returns to make a report- to
Uncle Sam on his researches. The officers
of the vessel assert that Dr. Kinyoun has
now changed his mind and is confident
that San Francisco never had any plague.
M, Kirkwood is the advisory a^ent of
the Japanese Government, and may reach
Cuba, so he says. The chances are, how
ever, that he comes to aid in negotiating
a loan for Japan. He will spend some
weeks in Gotham. Mr. Kirkwood has
been stationed at Tokio for many years
and has learned. the art of Oriental secre
tlveness. <r;i ;
The Rev. Mr. Alexander has been a mis
sionary in India for more than a genera
tion. He and his wife and daughter will
spend the winter In California.
F. H. Callundan has been United States
postmaster at Hollo, P. I., and comes home
for a vacation. Those who knew Fred
in the internal revenue office some years
ago will give him a hearty welcome home.
K. Kume is the secretary of the Bureau
of Communication at Toklo. and he and
Mr. Kirkwood will go East together.
Y. Iwakoshl comes here to become an
attache of the Japanese Consulate, and
A. Carpenter Is a mining man from Su

HEYDENFELDT
WIDOWS AT WAR
Contest for Late Jurist's
Property Assumes
New Phase.
Another Dispute Arises Over
Alleged . Lease and
Compromise.
An answer and counter-claim was filed
yesterday by Elizabeth Heydenfeldt to
the suit instituted by Henrietta Heyden
feldt some time ago. She denies the alle
gation made by the plaintiff that she
leased to her the property in dispute, one
piece of which is located at Geary an.i
Webster streets and the other on .Pacific
street, near E>uj>ont.
Elizabeth Heydenfeldt declares that on
the date on which the plaintiff claims the
lease was made, October 23, 1893, she was
the owner in fee simple of the property.
She says, however, mat sne agreed 'to a
compromise to avoid UUgation oy paying
the plamtitf V15.W0 and $i25 a montn dur
ing ine plaintirt's life. To secure these
payments the defendant ciaims she con
\t-yed to the plaintirf a lire interest in
thÂ«?â property.
The defendant further claims that, she
lived up to trie agreement until Septem
ber 14, iSK>, when she ceased to do so be
cause the piaintitx then repudiated the
compromise and commenced legal pro
<*-euings.
The action now pending is but one of
the many phases of the lamous" Heyden
feldt case, .caused by the conflicting
claims of the plaintiff and defendant in
suits instituted against â¢ the former
Judge's estate. ...
They both claim to be the widow of
the late Judge Solomon Heydenfeldt.
Elizabeth Heydenfeldt says she is the
widow of the late jurist and claims that
Henrietta Heydenfeldt is in reality Hen
rietta Herbert, a half-sister of the de-
Ceased Judge. Elizabeth Heydenfeldt
claims she was married to Judge Hey
denfeldt by Chief Justice Hugh C. Mur
ray of the California Supreme Court in
1853. and that- owing- to cruelty she was
compelled to leave him. She denies that
Henrietta Heydenfeldt was ever married
to the Judge, and that the latter was in
sane when he executed the will ! which
has caused such a long and bitter con
test between the two women. . :
Elizabeth Heydenfeldt in the cross-com
plaint filed yesterday asks that the al
leged lease be adjudged to be a part of
the compromise, invalidated, as she al
leges, by the plaintiff, and that the latter
be compelled- to â  return $17,900 paid her
while the compromise was in force. She
also asks that certain transfers of inter
ests in the Heydenfeldt property made
by the plaintiff to G. H. Mangels and J.
I-. Crlttenden be declared void.
Recital Well Attended.
Despite the inclement weather, the re
cital which was given last night by Mrs.
Fred H. Hanson at Sherman-Clay Hall was
well attended. The hall was artistically
decorated with cut flowers and potted
plants. Six young ladies attired in white
acted as ushers. The programme of the
monologues and recitals consisted of se
lections from Shakespeare. Kipling
Browning. Dickens. Paul Laurence Dun
bar. James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene
Field and other famous authors. Mrs.
Hanson acquitted herself in the most com
mendable manner. . .

MURE5CA STRIKES HER COLORS,
FINISHING BACK IN THE RUCK
Botany Looms Up as a High=Class Mud Per=
formerÂ«=O'Connor Lands a Couple of
Long Shots.
NOTHING caused so much surprise
at Oakland track yesterday as
the defeat of "Frisco" Lind's
chipper mud lark Muresca in the
third event, a sprint over the Fu
turity course. The filly has been consid
ered well-nigh Invincible in the mud, and
as it rained almost continuously and the
course was ankle deep in slush the shrewd
ones climbed aboard at 3 to 2. The favor
ite met with ignominious defeat, but the
disaster is easily accounted for. At the
start she went out with Glendenning, set
ting a clip so fast that it was only a
question as to which would stop first.
Right in their wake came Botany, with
Johnny Woods up. simply galloping. Be
low the paddock Muresca gave it up and
Woods, letting out a wrap on Botany, won
In a walk. Glendenning deserves credit
for his gameness, for he fought it out to
the wire, lasting just long enough to get
the place from Sir l^ewis by a i\ose. The
winner is a brown gelding by Watercress-
Pensa, and In the hands of the competent
young trainer. Fred Edwards, will be
heard from later on in possibly more re
fined company.
Winnie O'Connor had his mud clothes on
and no mistake, getting home first in the
opening dash on .Lapidus, a 15 to 1 shot,
and further down the line he brought in
Dunblane at 5 to 1. Fitzkanet was the
.only favorite to win laurels. He was only
a lukewarm one.
Several times Lapidus has been played,
but failed to put any flour in the barrel.
Drifting to 15 to 1, the Jennings entry led
all the way in the 2-year-old scramble,
which opened the sport. In a hard drive
Mounce. on Marelio, snatched the place
from Waterscratch by a neck. Quadra,
the favorite, was flat-footed when the
barrier went up, and failed to show to
any advantage.
Harry Stover met with more luck in the
five and a half furlong run following. His
brown sprinter Edinborough, ridden by-
Lee Jackson, beat the barrier, and Fla
mero, the even money choice, could not
quite get up, losing at the wire by a
length. The winner's odds were played
from 4 down to 2 and in some books to
S to 5.
' Sturdy looking Fitzkanet carried his 100
pound impost and J. Daly, to the front
in the handicap over six furlongs. He
had no easy thing of it, though, for
Prank Bell led him a merry chase. John
ny Daly rode a pretty race on "Fitz,"
timing his wove perfectly. Mounce let
Frank Bell sift along in the lead, and for
a time it looked as if he would last out.
Tiring, though, below the sixteenth pole,
he was nabbed by Fitzkanet and in an
invigorating drive beaten out a neck. Ja
nice did not seem to be at herself, finish
ing third, %ix lengtns away. Grafter, the
only other starter, performed poorly.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry Ber
nota came in for extensive backing in the
betting on the seven-furlong selling af
fair. The brown gelding did not get a
very good send off and was outfooted all
the way. Dunblane apparently outgameu
Gusto, disposing of the Brutus horse by
more than a length.
They finally took FJoronso into camp.
The patched up cripple ruled a 7 to 10 fa
vorite for the concluding mile and an
eighth run and came in third. . Birken
rtith rushed Sunello, a G to 1 shot, away
in front at the start and won all the â way.
Mounce made a long journey of it with
the favorite, losing the place to Lodestar
by four lengths. ' .
Track Notes.
v Willie Buchanan concluded to take â  a
trick at the wheel and had the leg up on
Waterscratch in the first event. He met
with some poor luck at the start, else he
probably would have finished first.
Some fault was found with Mounce's
ride on Floronso. It must be remembered
that the old fellow has one leg that re
sembles a Fijian war club and is lame
two-thirds of the time. The Idaho boy
had a mount in every race, was once first;
four times second and once third.
Lee Jackson, who rode Edinborough,
rode with marked success on the Cana
dian circuit the past season.

NATIVES HUNT
THE CANNIBAL
Tutuilans Fear the Pres
ence of Solomon
Islander.
Special Correspondence,
HONOLULU, Nov. 27.â There was a
great deal of apprehension among the
peaceful and kindly natives of the island
of Tutulla at the time the navy trans
port Solace left Pago Pago for this port.
It was all on account of the escape from
the supply ship Abarenda of a Solomon
Islander, who had taken refuge â  there
from the natives several months before,.
It seems that on the island on which
Apia is situated the Germans have im
ported many Solomon Islanders, to work
on the plantations. These people' are very
savage and given to cannibalism. Three
of them escaped from their masters and,
stealing a canoe, traveled to Tutuita, a
distance by water of about eighty miles.
Landing on the island, they took to the
bush and began marauding. They first
lived on chickens and pigs which they
stole and there were fruits' and water in
abundance to be had for the taking. Not
content with these good things, they made
their presence felt by stealing and killing
a couple of children, whose bodies they
devoured. â¢ \
The Tutuilans, finding out about the
cannibals, gave chase to tnem and after
a very exciting hunt succeeded :'.n killing
two. The third escaped to the Abarenda,
where he was given protection. He re
mained aboard quite a long time, but
took to the bush a day or two before the
Solace sailed. His being at large and the
depredations feared at his hands are what
is causing. the excitement among the Tu
tuilans, â  who have organized a hunting
squad and are out looking for the man.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.â King's plaster mills at
New Brighton, Staten Island, said to be the
largest plant of its kind in the country, was
destroyed by fire to-day. The loss is estimated
at $100,000. It is thought that Robert Swanton
and a colored man named Hamilton, employed
in the works, perished in the flames.

EXPERTS FIND
A DEFALCATION
National Bank in an
Eastern City Closes
Suddenly.
BALL.STON, N. Y., Dec. 3.-The First
National Bank of this place was closed to
day, pending an investigation .by a Na
tional Bank Examiner. It is stated that
the closing of the bank's doors followed
the discovery of irregularities in the ac
counts of the teller, Charles E. Fitcham.
The bank began business in 1865. Judge
J. 8. Lamoreaux succeeded the late
George West as president early in Octo
ber of this year, and H. J. Donaldson suc
ceeded to the vice presidency. The new
executive officers, at once began a thor
ough Investigation of the bank's affairs
and discovered indications of a defalca
tion on the part of Teller Fitcham. The
investigation was pursued until it was
seen thafthe defalcation had begun many
years ago and attained large figures.
Bank Examiners Graham, and Van
Vranken were sent for, and yesterday _ be
gan a thorough examination. At the close
of banking hours they reported a short
age of $100,000. The directors then decided
to close the bank, pending an investiga
tion, and a warrant for Fitcham's arrest
was issued. Fitcham has a wife and one
daughter. President, Lamoreaux said to
day that it was not possible to determine
the amount of Fitcham's defalcation
without an inspection of the outstanding
certificates of deposit and depositors
pass-books. The examination, he said,
shows the teller alone is responsible.
Lamoreaux added that it is not thought
possible that any loss can come to de
positors or certificate holders, as the bank
has a surplus of $100,000, which, it is hoped,
will nearly or quite meet the deficit and
leave the bank's capital of $100,000 unim
paired. An examination of the bank by
Examiner Van Vranken last August
failed to disclose any irregularity in the
accounts. ; â  :â  ' â¢ '. . ";-.'â >-;*

TRIES ESCAPE
FROM GALLOWS
Criminal Rushes From
Cell Before Execu
tion Hour.
MOUNT HOLLY, N. J., Dec. 3,â Charles
Brown made a desperate attempt to break
jail a short time before the hour set for
his execution. this morning. As his spirit
ual adviser, the Rev. J. C. Diesinger of
Camden, was "leaving the cell, in compli
ance'with a wish of the prisoner that he
be left alone half an hour to prepare him
self for death, Brown suddenly rushed
from his cell armed with a piece of lead
pipe, which he brandished at the guards.
Surprised by the suddenness of the at
tack the guards fell back. . Brown dashed
down the corridor, sprang down a short
flight of stairs and reached | the kitchen.
He waved aside the guards who were fol
lowing him, jumped through a window
and reached the â  yard, where he armed
himself with an ax. One of the deputies
who approached the desperate man was
struck on the arm with a piece' of pipe,
when others closed in on Brown and over
powered him. * He . was manacled and
placed in his cell to await execution. He
was hanged at 10:05 o'clock for complicity
in the â¢ munder of Washington, Hunter.
Death was almost instantaneous.
Washington Hunter was a wealthy re
tired farmer, aged 70 years, and lived with
his wife at Riverside, N. . J. : On the night
of January 25 last Charles Brown, John
Young, Charles Miller and Otto Keller
forced an entrance into Hunter's house
with the intention of robbing the place.
Hunter resisted and was brutally beaten
with an iron bolt. His wife brought him
a revolver, with which he defended him
self until his assailants were frightened
away. Hunter died four* days later.
Young and Keller were arrested in New
York and Keller turned State's evidence.
He is now awaiting sentence.
Brown was found in Sing Sing -prison,
where he was serving a term for-.bur
glary. Governor Odell . pardoned him in
order that he might be brought here for
trial on the murder charge. Miller has
not yet been apprehended. Young and
Brown were both convicted of murder in
the first degree' and were' to have been
hanged together' to-day. Young, however,
secured a writ of error f^om the Court
of Errors and Appeals, which acted as a
stay. â¢

HEARD HERE FOR FIRST TIME
Wagner Taxes the Physical Power of Grau Singers.
Salve's Farewell Takes Place To=Night.
BTT BLANCHE'PARTINGTON.
1DID not take my, prayer-mat down
to the opera-house last night to kneel
and listen; thus to "Tristan and
Isolde," as* Wagner's young adorers
in the Fatherland used to listen to
the new "Lohengrin/'- but I felt that-one
would have come in handily during the
evening. It is one of the world love
poems, fitted to music of the most In
timately beautiful sort, by the master mu
elclan at of his power. .Wagner's
genius finds here its most characteristic
expression, its ripest, noblest form, and
in all music there is nothing so unap
proachably lovely as some of its divine
measures. It Is an epic of the loves of
the elemental man and woman, primitive,
powerful, all-possessing, wedded to theme
and harmony that paint the lovely story
in all its -wealth of brilliant and subtle
suggestion with miraculous power. It Is
Hooded with color, dazzling and yet most
delicate, odorous half-tones and scarlet
otes of passion color dreamed, and the
iash of the brown of earth. Strange chro
natlc intervals dominate largely the mel
odic scheme of "Tristan and Isolde," and \
\\ agner obtains thus the distinctive effect
cf the music-drama. The characteristic
themes are almost all of this elusive char
acter, crystallizing the undertow of erne
uon, not personifying action. The music
orama is the eighth of the Wagnerlan se
ries to be given here, four of the "Ring"
cycle, "Die Fliegende Hollander," "Tann
hauser, "Lohengrin" and "Die Meister
singer the others, and it compares with
the rest as "Romeo and Juliet" compares
witn the other Shakespearean dramas,
the love story incomparable.
There was a poor house to greet "Tris
tan and Isolde" last night. The cast, de
spite its masculine strength, lacked on
the feminine side, and 6O, despite the nov
elty of the music drama, the crowd stayed
away. Van Dyck was the Tristan, and
was a stately and noble figure. He sang
as Van Dyck has never sung here before,
his voice holding. out to the last colossal
requirement of the role. Again his pow
erful dramatic faculty helped to make
an unforgettable portrait of the knight,
ana the whole measure of â¢ Van Dyck's
attainment here is of the largest; The
scene when the love philter is â¢ talten
aboard the ship, with its Quivering or
chestral accompaniment, was acted with
splendid power; the love scene in the
garden was filled in with an ardent and
dignified grace, and the scene where Tris
tan, dying, sees Isolde in a vision was
a marvelous bit of work. Tristan is a
long time dyingâ Van Dyck is credited
â¢with thirty-nine minutes as against the
conventional fortyâ but the singer holds
the interest in a truly remarkable fash-
Ion. He is a pretty great man. Louise
Reuss-Belce we must be thankful for, as
without her the opera could not have
eeen heard here. She Is one of the few
fingers who can attempt the tremendous
;ple % and really did some . surprisingly
strong work last night; but the voiceâ
Â£ard, strained, shrillâ hurts the ear, and
one can only surmise what it may have
been once and regret that its day has
gone. But she has undoubted power, lifts
to a. fine climax and acts, if not always
with fine art. at least with sincere and
earnest intention. The effort of memory
alone is immense, and altogether Reuss-
Belee's work last' night is entitled to a
sincere respect.
Mr. Bispham's Kurvenal was another
excellent portrait in the Bispham gallery,
and his vibrant, sympathetic voice was a
particularly valuable addition to the ef
fect. De Reszke was Marke, and in
noble voice and form. He was a. mag
nificent picture as usual, -and delivered
his epic of reproach to Tristan with a
splendid strength and dignity. Louise
Homer again showed what she can do, and
more, what she some day is going to do
In *he music drama as Brangene. She
sang. with delightful sympathy and acted
with considerable truth of inspiration.
Damrosch conducted with acclamation,
and others who added were Mr. Muhl
mann as Melot- and j Mr. ' Reiss. whose

LOOK IT UP.
Perhaps Coffee Is the Cause of Your
Trouble.
Eating or drinking the wrong kind of
food or beverage will set up disease - If
persisted in. That is particularly true of
the more starchy foods and coffee. The
trouble may show in a variety of differ-
ent ways., . . ' ."
" It is safe to say that if one Is ailing in
any part of the body reached by the
nervous system, it would be of ad-
vantage to euch a one to exchange cof-
fee for Postum Food Coffee, and quit
much use of white bread and take on
Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food.
A" New Tork man's experience is worth
knowing. He says: "I was for a long
time troubled with general weakness and
loss of ambition, without knowing the
cause. Always after eating I would find
myself practically helpless, and when I
reached home at night could only find re-
lief after dinner by throwing myself on
the. lounge and hardly speaking a dozen
words to my family the entire evening,
and as a last resort go to. bed.
â¢'I could look back to the days when I
was athletic and full of ambition, but
what made the change I could not figure
out. I lost eighteen pounds of flesh, and
eeemed to be entering a chronic state of
invalidism. Â»
"One day my eye caught the argument
in one of the advertisements of Postum .
Food Coffee, and it occurred to me that
perhaps coffee was getting In its work
on me without my knowledge. At any
rate I must do something, so I quit drink-
ing coffee altogether and took on Postum,
and also began the use of Grape-Nuts
Breakfast Food. In a short time I- be-
gan to enjoy life again; found myself run-
ning upstairs two steps at a time, and a
general return of energy, ambition and
etrength. I not only regained my eight-
een pounds, but put seven more on top
of It. Now we always have Grape-Nuts
and Ppstum each meaL The children
drink the Food Coffee as well as wife and
myself, and I will guarantee there is no ;

TWOVOCAL STARS OF-THE GRAU GRAND OPERA COMPANY WHO
SANG LEADING ROLES LAST EVENING IN WAGNER'S FAMOUS
-..- COMPOSLTION,;"TRISTAN^UND ISOLDE." ...... i . -
FOR the first time in this city
Wagner's opera, "Tristan and
Isolde," was heard last evening
at the Grand Opera-house by an
audience that was very small,
considering the importance of the produc
tion.
Though the many vacant seats would
ordinarily discourage the artists, those
who sang last evening did so with re
markable vigor and impressed the audi
ence by the physical power they dis
played.
That which pleased the audience last
night was not the music, but the man
ner in which the singers were able to
sustain the arduous troies. van Dyck, in
the role of Tristan, was called upon in
the last act to recount the story of his
life, and did so for the space of thirty
nine minutes. â¢ â¢
Reuss-Belce and Louise Homer, with
Eispham, Muhlmann, Bars, Reiss and
De Reszke, also figured in the cast and
sang the difficult music as if it were an
every-day occurrence.
It was the'geneTal opinion, expressed in
the lobby between..acts, that in "Tristan
and Isolde" Wagner had eclipsed himself
in the orchestration. The weird music
produced by the orchestra under Dam
rosch was listened to most carefully.
There was no spontaneous applause in
the middle of scenes, for the music of the
opera is of the heaviest kind and most
impressive. . _ \'rL<'li.
The plot of the opera deals with the
love of Tristan, a Cornish knight, for
Isolde, a Princess of Ireland. He is act
ing as her escort on the journey she Is
making to Ireland to become the bride of
King Mark, uncle of Tristan. Isolde loves
Tristan and in despair at his coldness,
due to a blood feud, she attempts to.poi
son him and herself. Her . attendant
changes the poisoned cup for one con
taining a love potion. Tristan and Isolde
drink the draught and declare their love.
In the second act Isolde is the wife of
King Mark, but holds meetings with
Tristan. â¢ Melot, a Jealous friend of Tris
tan, betrays him to the King. The guilty

Doric Sails^ for Orient
Without One of Her
Chinese Crew. >
Joseph Alexander and George Alexan
der, arrested for smuggling silk caps and
other dutiable articles off the steamer
Doric, were taken before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock yesterday
morning and were released on $500 bonds.
The Doric sailed yesterday minus 'Leong
How, her sailmaker, who sold a lot of
smuggled goods to the Alexanders. Leong
is a member of thÂ© crew and not entitled
to land in the United States, and for that
reason It was thought inadvisable to arrest
him, lest complications should arise be
cause of the provisions of the exclusion
act, but it was finally decided that his
being arrested for a violation of the rev
enue laws of the United States would be
proper as a protective measure, and on
complaint of Customs Inspectors J. B.
Peppin a warrant was issued by United
States Court Commissioner Heacock for
the sailmaker' s apprehension.

The Oregon Supreme Court holds that
the primary election law of that State is
constitutional. The law was enacted by
the Oregon Legislature after the Supreme
Court of this State had declared the
Stratton ' primary law unconstitutional,
and it differs but t little from the present
primary election "law of. California. : It
contains what Is known as the party tesi,
or the provision which requires the voter
to designate the party ballot. The poli
tical bosses In this State who are schem
ing to overthrow the present primary law
contend that the so-called party test pro
vision renders the act unconstitutional.
They boast that our Supreme Court will
declare the act invalid on the ground that
it violates the secrecy of the ballot. .. Re
cent activity of the bosses to get posses
sion Of the County Committee' of San
Francisco created the suspicion that a
scheme had been hatched to assail the
law, and p'ave the way for the appoint
ment of delegates to the next Republican
State Convention. In the light of the Ore
gon decision touching the constitutional
ity of an act similar to the California
law there is good reason for predicting
that the bosses and not the primary law
will be knocked out if the case goes to
our Supreme Court:'.
Chinese Exclusion Settled.
The Democrats, must bring forward a
new Issue for the next campaign in" this
State. The question of Chinese exclusion
has been settled by President Roosevelt.
A law prepared jointly by Mr. Powderly,
Commissioner of Immigration, and the
California delegation in Congress will be
passed early in the session and secure
the immediate approval of the chief exe
cutive of the nation.
The folly ol the chairman of the late
Exclusion Convention in garbling the
message wired by Representative Need
ham is now obvious. Had the dispatch
in its true form been presented a junket
ing committee of live to visit Washing
ton would not have been authorized. The
delegates were led to believe that a bitter
fight against exclusion was inevitable.
Mr. Needham's telegram in its true test
gave Just the contrary intelligence, but
the assuring clause of his message was
withheld from the convention.
No Use for Junketers.
As there is no opposition in Congress
to exclusion of the coolie Chinese it will
not be necessary for Geary's committee
of four Democrats and one high toned
Republican to proceed to the national cap
ital at the expense of the public. Ex-
Governor Budd may be delighted when
he reflects that he will not be, obliged to
neglect for even a day his arduous duties
as attorney of the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners. He can stay right
Where he Is on the water front ana advise
against the ravages of the teredo.
Truxton Beale will not be constrained
to l'orego the pleasure of life in Burlin
game during the holidays. He can remain
here in the fullest enjoyment of the Cali
fornia climate with perfect assurance that
Congress will legislate wisely.
Mayor Phelan will not be oblieed to
abandon his preparations for a foreign
tour in order to assist the President of the
United States and the members of the Sen
ate and House of Representatives in deal
ing with the important subject of foreign
immigration. On his way to Europe, at
his own expense, Mr. Pnelan may have
the opportunity of visiting Washington,
paying his respe'ets to President Roosevelt
and congratulating the latter on the re
enactment of exclusion. In bestowing
credit where credit is due, the Mayor, of
course, will not neglect Senators Bard and
Perkins or Representatives .Loud, Need
ham, Metcalf, Kahn, Woods.'Coombs and
McLachlan. , â¢ .
The Souvenirs Remain.
Members of the junketing committee; ap
pointed by Mr. Geary have beautiful sou
venirs of the promised expedition. Each
commltteeman can place in a gilded frame
the commission issued to him by Gov
ernor Gage. In the future the commission
will call to mind that Gage was Governor
of the State. To preserve the hormonies
the frame might be wrought and gilded
to resemble a gold brick, and then if time
should dim the signature of Gage, the
sign of the brick would attest the genuine
character of the souvenir." , ; .

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. <
Continued From Page Five.
among men" â the . Congress has from time to
time given it other important functions. Such
trusts. have been executed by the institution:
with notable: fidelity. There should be no halt
in the "work of the institution,, in accordance
with the plans which its secretary has pre
sented, for the preservation of the vanishing
races of great North American animals in the
National Zoological Park. The urgent needs
of the National Museum are recommended to
the favorable consideration of the Congress.
Perhaps the most i characteristic educational
movement of the past fifty years is that which
has created the modern public library and de
veloped it Into broad and active service. There
are now over five thousand public libraries in
the United States, the product of this period.
In addition to accumulating material, â¢â  they
are also striving by organization, | by improve
ment In method, -and by co-operation, to give
greater efficiency to the material they hold,
to make: it more widely useful, and by avoid
ance of unnecessary duplication in process to
reduce the cost of Its administration.
In these efforts they, naturally look , for as
sistance to the Federal library, which though
still the Library of; Congress, and so entitle'!,
is the one . national library of the United
States. Already the largest single collection
of books on the Western Hemisphere, and cer
tain to â  increase more rapidly than any other
through purchase, exchange and . the operation
of the copyright law, this -library has a unique
opportunity to render to. the libraries of this
countryâ to American scholarshipâ service of
the highest importance.. It 19 housed. In a
building which Is the largest and most magni
ficent yet. erected for library uses. Resources
are now â  provided which will . develop the col
lection properly, equip it with the apparatus
and service necessary to its effective use, ren
der its bibliographic work .widely available,
and enable it to become not merely a center
of research but the . chiet ractor in great co-:
operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge
and {the advancement of learning.
For the sake of good administration,, sound
economy and the advancement of science the
Census Office as now constituted . should be
made a permanent Government bureau.. This
would insure better, cheaper and more satis
factory we-rk, in -the interest not -only -of our
business but of statistic, economic and. social
science. ?Â« '
POSTAL SERVICE
STILL EXPANDS
Success of the Rural Free
Delivery So Marked That
the Demand for Extension
Is Considered General and
Urgent.
The remarkable growth of the postal service
Is shown in the fact that its revenues have
doubled and its expenditures have nearly
doubled within twelve years. Its progressive
development compels constantly increasing
outlay, but In this period of business energy
and'prosperity Its receipts grow so much fas:er
than its expenses . that the annual deficit has
been steadily reduced from $11,411,779- in 1S37 to
$3,923,727 in 1901. '. Among recent postal ad
vances the success of rural free delivery wher
ever established has .been so marked, and
actual experience has made its benefits eo
plain, that the demand for its extension is
general and urgent.
' It is Just that the great agricultural popula
tion should share in the . improvement of the
service. The number of rural routes now in
operation is 6009, practically all. established
within three years, and there are 6000 applica
tions awaiting action. It is expected that the
number In operation at the close of the current
ftecal year will reach 8600. The mall will then
be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our
people who have heretofore been dependent
upon distant offices, and one-third of all that
portion of the country which is adapted to It'
will be covered by. this kind of service.
The full measure of postal progress which
might be realized has Ions been hampered and
obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on
the Government through the intrenched and
well-underctood abuses which have, grown up
in connection â ' wltH second-class j mail â  matter.
The extent of this burden appears when it is
stated that' \ while . the second-class matter
makes, nearly three-fifths of .the weight of all
the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only
$4,294,445 "of the aggregate postal revenue of
5111,631,193. 'if the pound rate of postage,
â¢which produces the large \ loss thus entailed,
and which | was fixed by * Congress â  with the
purpose of encouraging the dissemination of
public information, were limited to the legiti
mate newspapers and 'periodicals actually con
templated by the law, no just exception could
be taken. That expense would be the recog
nized and accepted cost of a liberal public
policy deliberately adopted fcr a justifiable' end.
But much of the matter which enjoys the priv
ileged rate. is wholly outside of the intent of
the law,' and has secured admission only
through " an ' evasion of its requirements or
through lax construction. The proportion of
such wrongly included matter Is estimated by
postal experts to be one-half of the whole vol
ume of second-class mail: If it be only one
third â¢ or " one-quarter, the magnitude of the
burden Is' apparent. The Postofflce Department
has now undertaken to remove the abuses so
far as is possible by a stricter application of
the "law; and it should be sustained in Jts
effort.' ' ' . : â  ' > /

.The general terms of the settlement of the
questions growing out of the anti-foreign upris
ings In China of 1900, having been formulated
in a Joint note addressed to China by the rep
resentatives of the injured powers in Decem
ber last, were promptly accepted by the Chi
nese Government. After protracted conferences
the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were
able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese
plenipotentiaries; on thÂ» 7th of last September,
setting forth the measures taken by China in
compliance with the demands of the joint note,
and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It
will be laid .before . Congress, with a report
of tHe plenipotentiary on- behalf of -the United
States, William Woodvllle Rockhill, to whom
high praise is due for thertact. good Judgment
and energy -he 'has .displayed in; performing an
'exceptionally difficult and^ delicate task.' , :
\ ftThe agreement reached disposes of the va
rious grounds of complaint in a manner satis
; factory to' the powers and' will* contribute ma
terially â  to â  better future relations between
China and the powers. Reparation has been
made by China for the murder of foreigners
during the uprising and puiiishment â  has;,"bee'n

In all cities in which foreigners have been mur
dered or cruelly treated, and edicts 'have been
issued making all officials :*iirectly. responsible
for the future safety of foreigners and for. the
suppression of violence against them.
Provisions have been

necessary maintain per
manent military guards; by dismantling the
military works between the capital and the
sea;- and by allowing the temporary mainte
nance of foreign military posts along this line.
An edict has been issued by the Emperor of
China prohblting for two years the' importation
of arms and ammunition.' into China. China
has agreed to pay adequate, indemnities to the
states, societies and individuals for the losses
sustained by them, and for the expenses of the
military expeditions sent by the- various pow
ers to protect life and restore order.
Under the provisions of the Joint. note of De
cember, 1900, China has agreed to revise the
treaties of commerce and navigation ! and to
take such other steps for the -purpose of facili
tating foreign trade as the foreign powers may
decide to-be needed. Â»-~ Â»____.â ,Â». _. -.

the purpose of substituting specific for ad" valo

on the part of the United States to assist in
this work. A list of articles to remain free 'of

During these troubles our Government has
unswervingly advocated moderation; and has

between China and the nations, on a footing:
of equal rights and advantages to all. We
advocate-the "open door" with all that it im

Deep Sympathy.
. "We view with lively, interest and keen hope
of beneficial results the proceedings of the Pan
American Congress, convoked at the lnvltatloi
of Mexico, and now sitting: at the Mexican capl
tal. The delegates of the United States ar
. under the most liberal instructions to eo
operate; ;â  with" their^ colleagues in -all matter
promising advantage to the great family of
American commonwealths, as well in their re
lations among themselves as in their domestic
advancement and in their Intercourse with the
world at large. '
My predecessor communicated to Con
gress the fact that the Well and La Abra
awards against Mexico have been, adjudged by
the highest courts of our country to have been,
obtained through fraud and perjuryon the part
of the claimants, and that In accordance with.
the acts of the Congress the money remaining
in the hands of the Secretary of State on these
awards has been returned to Mexico. A con
siderable portion of the money received from
Mexico on these awards had been paid by this
Government to the claimants before the de
cision of the courts waa rendered. My judg
ment .is . that Congress should return to
Mexico an amount equal to the sums thua al
ready paid to the claimants.
The death of Queen Victoria caused the people
of the United. States deep and heartfelt sor
row, to which the Government gave full ex
pression. When President McKlnley died our
nation in turn received from every quarter, of
the British empire . expressions .of grief., and
sympathy no less sincere. The death of the
Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany, also
aroused the genuine sympathy of the American
people; and this sympathy was cordially re
ciprocated by Germany when the President waa
assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of.
the civilized world we received, at the time
of the President's death, assurances of such
grief and regard aa to touch the hearts of our
people. In the midst of our affliction we rev
erently thank the Almighty that we are at
peace with the nations of mankind, and we
firmly intend that our policy shall be such, as
to .'continue unbroken these international rela
tions of mutual respect and good will.

selling mostly around 8%c. Pulled are in good
supply and in light request, holders asking
from V-'iVic. Bag tigs are wanted by bakers,
good quality meeting 'with active demand from
5<g5Hc For the poorer grades 4@4%c is gen
erally asked, with confectioners looking for
supplies at about %c less. Persian dates are
in lair demand for Salr and Khadrawi. but
Hallowi are poor and sell rather slowly. Hal
lowi are quoted from 2%@3%c, according to
holder. Peaches are steady, with quite a good
call for medium grades. Apricots continue
quiet and unchanged. Prunes are not very
plentiful and meet with fair demand. The
feeling en the coast Is firmer and few Santa
Claras are now offered at less than a 3c basis.
Offers on a 2%c basis for 40-50s and 50-60s were
reported turned down on Wednesday.
"The local trade is considerably disturbed by
a report that the syndicate of coast packers
controlling several hundred cars of very small,
old prunes on the coast will ship 200 cars to
this market around the Horn and pack and
sell the goods here themselves. Another rumor
has it that a lot of around 250 tons has been
purchased by a leading commission-house here
at $2 60 per cwt., delivered."
Activity in Lumber.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: "There
has never been a more prosperous season for
the lumber trade circles of this State than
the one that the manufacturers and retailers
are enjoying at the present writing. Orders are
most plentiful, while prices are at the highest
tide they have been for some years past. The
mills are often forced to run overtime to keep
anywhere near their order books, while the
products of the many plants along the coast
and interior of California are being shipped
to all points of the world and to the Eastern
States, and the local field as well is extremely
exacting in its demands.
"There has been an advance of nearly $4 a
thousand made in the redwood for Eastern
shipment, while local prices are also advanc
ing, as the demand is far and away ahead of
the production. Shingles are also going out
of this State In large quantities and prices
are holding well along toward the maximum.
The Eastern dealers are learning what superior
qualities redwood possesses and the results are
being displayed in the run of orders which
the mills cannot begin to fill at this writing.
"The combination of manufacturing plants
for the purpose of increasing the facilities for
handling Eastern orders must come and come
eoon or the mills of the redwood belt will be
swamped with orders. Many of the latter are
being turned down or aside and this state of
affairs cannot last long without causing dis
satisfaction on the part of those concerns de
manding large and remunerative orders. Why
it is that the manufacturers cannot satisfac
torily realize this and take the steps to cir
cumvent any possible disaffection Irom any
source whatsoever is most surprising and hard
to realize from a business standpoint.
"The sugar and California white pine mills
are beginning to make their final month's cut,
for the snows will soon be on them. Heavy
profits have been the share of these pine mills
in the lumber circles of this State and the
owners are congratulating themselves on the
closing of a most successful season's work.
When the mills reopen next spring there will
be enough orders on thflr desks to keep the
saws humming for the entire year. These man
ufacturers are progressive and up-to-date in
their ideas of hew the trade should be handled
and the mills are proving great financial suc
cesses as a normal consequence. One mill
owner In the sugar pine belt told a represen
tative of this Journal that he had cleared
$88,000 this season, which is a splendid record
for the year. All in all Wood and Iron is not
diffident In prophesying that 1902 will be the
greatest year ever seen by the coast's lumber
men."

The weekly report of A, G. McAdle. section
director of the climate and crop service of

ern part of the San Joaquin Valley to nearly
three inches in the northern coast counties and
parts of the Sacramento Valley. The rainfall
throughout the State is considerably less than
at this date. last year, but the precipitation has
been penile and penetrating, accompanied by
abnormally warm weather, and has doubtless
been as beneficial in most places as heavier
rainfall. Very little enow has fallen in the
mountains. As this report goes to press rain
Is falling In the northern and central portions
of the State.
Plowing and seeding are progressing except
in the sections where the heaviest rainfall has
occurred and many districts report that an
Increased acreage of wheat will be planted.

and is In excellent condition in all sections
Green feed Is unusually abundant In nearly all
places and stock is in splendid condition. Al
filerilla has made remarkable growth in So
noma - County.
Orchards and vineyards have been benefited
by the rains, and are in good condition. Tree
pruning is progressing:, but vineyardlsts are
waiting for cooler weather before commencing
work on the vines. Orange picking and ship
ping are progressing; the yield is reported very
good and the quality excellent.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â The temperature
has been above normal during the week. Heavy
rain ttas fallen In all - parts of the valley,- in
some places amounting to , over two . inches.:
Conditions have been favorable for grass and

been greatly benefited by the- rain. Orange
picking and shipping are to progress.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.-Unusually
warm weather has prevailed in all sections,' ac
companied by heavy fogs and rain toward the
Â» close of the week. The rainfall In the central
and northern districts has been heavy, ' some
places reporting nearly three â¢ inches and re
tarded farm work. In the southern counties
the precipitation was considerably lighter, but
sufficient to soften the soil cultivation and
plowing will soon be resumed In all places.

ing the week has been â¢ generally warm and
cloudy through the day. with cool nights and
heavy fogs. Rain has fallen throughout the
valley, greatly benefiting growing crops and
softening the soil for cultivation.-. Early sown
grain continues In excellent condition and green
feed is abundant. The wheat acreage will
probably be considerably greater than that of
last year. Plowing and seeding are progressing
rapidly. Vineyard work has been delayed by
continued warm weather. Orchards are in good
condition. Orange picking Is nearly completed;
the yield and quality are very good. The
orange groves in the vicinity of Reedley will
be increased during the coming season.
SOUTHERN- CALIFORNIA.-The weather
during the week has been generally clear and
warm, with unusually heavy fogs at night
along the coast. No rain has fallen, but the
heavy fo/.s have been of considerable benefit
to vegetation and have saved irrigation water.
Plowing and seeding are progressing slowly,
owing to lack of rain. Early sown grain is in
good condition and green feed is plentiful.
Potatoes are not doing well In Orange County
and blight is showing in some places. The
second crop of raisin grapes in San Diego
County is nearly ready for delivery to packing,
houses. ) Oranges are in good condition and
prospects are pood for a heavy crop. Olive
picking is progressing.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Plowing and
seeding continue, but the ground is getting
very dry. Rain is needed to soften the soil ;
also for feed and early sown grain. Orange
shipping Is progressing; splitting continues;
crop lighter than last year.
EUREKA SUMMARY.â Abnormally warm
and rainy weather - during the past week.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock . Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.-Confuslon and hesi
tation were reflected in the movement of stock
prices all day, and 'the course of the market
did not persist In one direction for any length
ened period. The .movement during the morn
ing was irregular but leaned to the side of de
pression, -which- gave. way. about .midday to a
vigorous upward movement when the abstracts
of the President's message made their appear
ance. A slump in Amalgamated Copper and
a rise In call money rates unsettled . the mar
ket again late In the day. as was the base
yesterday. The sympathetic reaction did not
carry the level of prices back below last night,
THE S AN FRANCISCO . CALL, WEDNESDAY , DECEMBER 4, 1 901 .
as will.be seen by consultation of last prices,
which shows net gains as a rule. There- wis
some recovery- from the lowest, due to the cov
ering by. room shorts at the last. The early
heaviness of the market was due to some con
tinued uneasiness over the anti-trust views
contained in, the President's message. The
general tenor of the message has been pretty
well understood for several days past and what
selling was induced by its contents had mostly
been accomplished before the publication. The
tone of deprecation of the haoit of appeal to
hatred and â¢ fear - in the public arguments
against the so-called trusts seems to gratify
speculative sentiment and to ameliorate the
stock market effect of the recommendations for
regulation of the trusts. In consequence the
oemand to cover by shorts which followed the
publication of I the message carried the whole
market upward with considerable momentum,
the prices for the most prominent stocks ris
ing from 1 to 2 points over last night. The
sharp break In foreign exchange carried the
rate well below the gold export point and re
lieved apprehension that further gold would
go out this week. This helped the midday ral
ly in stocks, although call money rates were
distinctly firmer and maintained above ' the â¢ 4
per cent level for the most part. The rise to
5 per cent again came late in the day and
brought out heavy offerings which forced the
rate back to the low level of the day. Money
was easier in London, Paris and Berlin. The
payments of drafts against deposits of several
millions of gold at Pacific Coast points is still
pending. The movement of Amalgamated
Copper continued an inscrutable mystery. The
stock recovered quite vigorously in the morn
ing, although the omission of a customary
extra dividend by one of Its subsidiary com
panies, was not generally known when the
market closed yesterday. The renewed break
In the copper market in London to about Sat
urday's low level seemed equally without ef
fect on the stock. The break to 71% later was
without explanation. The stock rallied slight
ly and -then became heavy again, but the gen
eral market closed â  firm. -.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par .value,
$3,140,000.- ...... -, .â â 'â â

Chicago Grain Market
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.â Trade was very active In
wheat en a narrow range. A marked falling
off in Northwestern receipts' started better
prices. The country demand was very' good
and most of the buying orders seemed to be
for long profits rather, than for scalping. The
strength in the St. Louis market was particu
larly helpful. The world's total visible in
crease of 5,220,000 bushels had little effect on
the market. A good strength developing in
corn added to the bullish wheat incentives and
prices advanced well. Late in the session, how
ever, long wheat in great - quantities was
poured into the pit and though taken up quick
ly by bulls, depressed the market materially.
December opened steady, ranged between 73%c
and 74Â«ic. and closed easy %@%c lower, at 73%.
May opened unchanged, ranged between 78c and
78%c, and closed easy Â«*@V4, down,' at 78@78%c.
Corn was dull and weak the first two hours
of trade, while wheat was advanced. Cables
were lower and there was considerable selling.
Later the wheat advance made the shorts nerv
ous and on the report of a strong cash demand
many ran to cover. The advance was sharp
and - decisive and prices reached the highest
for the crop. On the rise profit taking caused
a reaction. December closed firm, \%c up, at
62%c. May closed strong, %c higher, at 65%c
Oats followed corn and showed strength in
the latter part of the session, establishing a
new record for 'May. -That option closed firm,
%@%c up. at 43%c. ' .' /
Provisions were heavy early on large :receipts
but the decline was moderate.* Trade was
rather dull. Later there was some open sell
ing by large packers and prices sagged. Janu

Poiiltry and Game.
A car of Eastern came in, making three thus
far this week. Owing to the very light demand
and the liberal arrivals from the East, the
market is ' weak, with the exception of Tur
keys, which are in demand, both live and
dressed.
Quotations for Game showed no change. Ar
rivals were 196 sacks.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Another decline in Eggs Is noted. They are
very weak and even the sharp reduction In
prices has failed- to stimulate the demand, and
arrivals are accumulating. Most dealers are
getting out from under, expecting a still fur
ther decline, as usual at this time of the year.
Cheese is easy, though supplies are not ex
cessive.
Butter Is off again. The market is too lib
erally supplied for the demand.
Receipts were 26,000 pounds of Butter,
pounds of Eastern Butter, 441 cases of Eggs.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
" Most of the Figs coming in are in bad con
dition. .Berries are Also wet and poor. The
Watsonville train was late, but those that ar
rived by express in time for the morning trade
sold well.
The supply of Grapes consists mainly of cai
ried-over stock, and the market is dull. Black
Grapes form the major part of the offerings,
and white Are firmer than black, being scarcer.
Bananas are weaker. Oranges also continue
weak at the decline. Lemons are slow. Limes
are 6lightly lower. ;]\ *
Supplies of Apples and Pears are ample, but
a fine Winter Nelis Pear will bring $2, and
Apples are moving off rather better.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
The market Is in very fair s> pe now, and
local dealers report the demand fully up to
normal proportions for this time of the year.
New Prunes are in better demand and clean
ing up, and prices, while no higher, are firmer.
Considerable confusion has been caused by the
large sale of old Prunes at San Jose, which
has disturbed the Eastern markets, as will be
seen in the first column. Apples and pitted

are closely held, and mostly In dealers' hands.

GOLDEN HARVEST
Robbery of Dwellings in
Mission District
Continues.
Midnight Prowlers Have Sev
eral Narrow Escapes
From Arrest
A gang of daring burglars has been op
erating in the Mission district for 'the
past week, and not a night passes but
one or mere burglaries are reported at
the Seventeenth-street police station. The
police are now considering- the advisabil
ity of placing a "blockade" in the district
after midnight, as all of the burglaries
retried have been committed in the
eaivy morning hours.
The burglars first commenced opera
tions on San Jose avenue, between Twen
ty-Second and Twenty-fourth streets,
and ransacked several dwellings. They
next moved down to Trtat avenue and
robbed a residence near Twentv-fourth
street. Thanksgiving ni&ht they broke
into two dwellings on the same avenue
between Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth
streets and carried off a lot of valuable
property. In one of the houses they over
looked a watch worth J150 and a heavy
gold chain. The watch was on a table
near a bed, and it is supposed that the
cracksmen feared to awaken the occu
pant of the room if they made too thor
ough a search. They took time enough,
however, to spill the contents of the
drawers of a bureau over the floor whTie
looking for money and jewelry. The night
following they tried to gain an entrance
to a flat on Twenty-fourth street, below
Folsom, but awakened the occupants and
were forced to beat a hasty retreat.
Early yesterday morning the industri
ous burglars were discovered while try
ing to force an entrance to a cigar stand
near the railroad depot. Twenty-fifth and
Valencia streets. They again escaped
and an hour later broke into the resi
dence of Mrs. Catherine Daley at 2936
Howard street. Mrs. Daley awoke while
they were in her bedroom, and when she
called to her daughter they ran through
the kitchen and out into the back yard,
having opened the kitchen door before
they commenced to search the house.
That all of the burglaries have been
ccsnvnitted by the same men is evidenced
by\| he fact that in every instance en
trance has been gained through a kitchen
window or door. All of the houses that
have been robbed run back to an alley
vray. so that in the event of discovery
the burglars ran less risk of being caught
by disappearing into the alley than by
being forced into the street, where there
was dariger of encountering policemen.
The police feel satisfied that the men who
gave Sergeant Duke and Policemen Pren
dergast and Young a lively run early last
Sunday morning are the burglars. The
men were seen leaving an alleyway run
ning off Twenty-fourth street, above Va
lencia, and took to their heels when the
officers started toward them. Several
shots were fired after the fugitives, who
managed to get away the heavv fog pre
vailing at the time being favorable to
their escape.
Policeman Brown arrested a suspect
yesterday afternoon and took him to the
Seventeenth-street station, where he will
be held pending an investigation. The
man in custody is believed to be one of
the burglars. He fits the description
given of a night prowler who was seen
in the neighborhood of one of the houses
robbed.

A CURE^JOR IT.
Not a Patent Cure All, Nor a
Modern Miracle but Simply a
Rational Cure for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbugrgery and de-
ception, the manufacturers of patent med-
icines, as a rule, seem to think their med- '
lcines will rot sell unless they claim that ,
it will cure every disease under the sun.
they never think of leaving- out dys-
jrepsia and stomach troubles. They, are
eure to claim that their nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to cure every dyspeptic and
he need look no further.
In the face of these absurd claims, it is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have carefully
?efrained from making undue claims or
fcSlse representations regarding the mer-
its of this most excellent remedy for dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They make
but one claim for it. and that is that for
indigestion and various stomach troubles
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is a radical
cure. They go no farther than this, and
any man or woman suffering from indi-
pestion, chronic or nervous dyspepsia,
who will give the remefiy a trial will find
that nothing is claimed for It that the
facts will not fully sustain.
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients acceptable
to the weakest or most delicate stomach.
Its great success in curing stomach trou-
bles is due to the fact that the medical
properties are such that it will digest
v,"hatevr>r wholesome food is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the stom-
ach is in good working order or not. It
rests the overworked organ and replen-
ishes the body, the blood, the nerves, cre-
ating a healthy appetite, gives refresh-
ing sleep and the blessingrs which always
accompany a good digestion and proper
assimilation of food.
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting Is required. Simply eat plenty of
V7bolesome food and take these Tablets
at each meal, thus assisting and resting
the stomach, which rapidly regains its
pr^or digestive power, -when the Tablets
trÂ» ;<e no loncrer required.
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply a condi-
tion in which some portion or portions of
the nervous system are not properly nour-
ished. Good digestion invigorates the
nervous eystem and every organ in the
bedy.
Any druggist will tell you Stuart's Dys- ,
pepsia Tablets give universal satisfaction.

SIX COMPANIES
COLLECTS FUNDS
Compels Chinese Passen
gers on Doric to Pay
Tribute.
Money to Be Used to Defeat
Passage of the Exclu
sion Act.
The Chinese Six. Companies has com
menced a â¢. determined, .fight against the
re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
act. It is endeavoring to raise a fund for
the prosecution of the flght. A few days
ago the Six â¢ Companies caused proclama
tions to be posted on the dead walls of
Chinatown requesting the Chinamen to
make contributions to the fund. It is
understood .that the. wealthy Chinese
merchants are subscribing liberally and
that already a very substantial amount
has been secured. â  â â¢: -V
The vigor with which the Six Com
panies intends to carry on the flght for
unrestricted Chinese immigration is well
illustrated by the manner in which it
levied a tax on Mongolians yesterday. The
Doric, which was the first vessel to leave
for China since the inauguration of the
fight, sailed yesterday. She was sched
uled to carry in the neighborhood of 200
Chinese. When the hour of departure
drew near and, the Chinese began to ar
rive, representatives . of the Six Com
panies made their appearance on . the
dock. They stopped every Chinaman and
compelled him to contribute toward the
fund. Not a single Chinaman was al
lowed to escape payment of the tribute
â¢unless he could show a receipt as evi
dence that he had already contributed.
The assessment was light, not over $3
in each case. In most cases the Ori
entals subscribed freely, but some proved
reluctant, to part with the coin that they
had earned in this country and were car
rying home to China.
In the proclamation which the Six Com
panies, issued it did not designate how
the fund is to be used in accomplishing
the defeat of the exclusion act, but there
is a well defined rumor to the effect that
it is to be expended in removing any feel
ing . which ' Eastern people may have ad
verse to the admission of Chinese.

The R.: T. Booth Co.:
Dear-Sirs: On Monday Â«f this week I wu ra â 
the thickest of one of my aVful catarrhal colds,
the kind that makes life not wortlx-llvinjr I
began using HTOMEI and its effeefcrwere won-
derful. I was greatly relieved In a few hours
and to-day am as sound as a dollar without
one bad effect remaining. Very truly yoxm.
-. . C. B. MORGA2*.
â 'â  It Is the .easiest thing in the world ta
stop a catarrhal cold Just at its beginning
and but very little trouble to cure onÂ©
after it has become settled. "
All you are obliged to do Is to Inhale
the new 'germicide HTOMEI every now
and then during: the day.
. HYOMEI is .not a nauseating, stomach,'
medicine which will disarrange the whole
digestive system and . create other dis-
eases far more dangerous than a cold, but
a dry germicide taken in the alp you
breathe.
The HYOMEI inhaler ia carried in th*
vest pocket and you can cure or prevent
coughs, croup, catarrh; pneumonia acd
consumption by simply breathing through
it for five or ten minutes dally;
It is guaranteed.
HYOMEI is sold by all druggists or sent
by mail for the following prices. ,'HYO-
MEI Outfits complete, $1.00; Trial Outfits,
25c;. HYOMEI Balm. 23c. Send for five
days' treatment free and our little book-
let on respiratory diseases. .It may. save'
your life. â

EOCTOR SAYS KERSHOW
WAS, MENTALLY UNSOUND
Medical Attendant of the Collegian
Claims He Was Not in Posses
sion of Reasoning Power, .
According to the testimony of Dr. H.
I...- Wagner, who attended Max Kershow
during his last Illness, the collegian was
not of sound mind at the time the docuÂ»
ment alleged to be his last will and testa
ment was executed. The doctor testified
yesterday in Department 9 of the Superior
Court, where the trial of the will, contest
Is being heard, that, in his "opinion, the
Yale athlete was not in possession of hia
reasoning powers. Dr. Wagner said that
the life Kershow had been living was cal
culated to destroy his brain, and that al
though there were times In which the un
fortunate young fellow was able to reason,
he was undoubtedly unsound of mind.
A letter written by Kershow in May,
1901, a month before his death, was then
introduced by Attorney Tauszky. The let
ter was addressed to C. M. Kershow, a
brother of the deceased, who is now~con
testing the will. The letter was ably writ
ten and was a request to : the brother to
send him all the money he (Max) had on
deposit, so that. he could pay his doctors
for their services. â¢ â¢ â¢ â -â¢
The contestants closed their case with
Dr. Wagner. The trial will be resumed
to-day, when Morgan Smith, who drew
up the will, will be placed on the. stand.

on the Anglo-Californian Bank, where he
had no funds. The case was continued
till December 9.
Pardee as already published has been
passing these worthless checks on numer
ous business men *and saloon keepers in
this city and in Oakland. He was booked
on'. two more charges yesterday, 'the com
plaining witness being Eugene Korn, the
hatter, Market street, who is out$25, and

tests that she had nothing to do -with his
troubles â¢ and does not want her- name
mentioned. â¢ . .
Pardee' claims that every cent of the
checks he has passed will be paid, and
that was why he had not left: the State.
He supposed the oank would pay . the
checks, as it had honored overdrafts on

passed the checks to get money, for gam
bling, but simply to meet his ordinary
expenses. He is indignant at being de
tained In prison..- - '...-. â  â¢ â¢ , .

CHARGE TURNER
WITH THE THEFT
Police THink Looter of
Stone's Shipyard Is
Captured.
Man Suspected of Robbery Is
Taken Into r Custody >.
. . at Guadaloupe. :v;"
â  Robert Turner, a former employe of
Stone's shipyard, was arrested last- night
at Guadaloupe on suspicion of being "the
man who on the afternoon, of November
23 cut a hole through the floor Of "the'com
pany's office at North Beach and in the
absence, of the cashier stole Jl&O, , which
w-as~intended.to.be used in paying 'off- the
employes of the concern.-. â¢ " ' .
Captain Seymour was notified of Tur
ner's'arrest by. tetephone. last "night, .and
he wired the constable of the town of
Guadaloupe to hold Turner until Detective
Coleman arrives to bring him back to this
city. â¢â¢ " *â  .-..'. .- â â¢.-
Captain Seymour feels certain that *he
can convict Turner of the crime. On the
day -of the robbery Turner was- seen .in
the -neighborhood of the looted- office with
an auger in hjs hand and this, coupled
with the fact that he failed to return to
work after the robbery, directed suspicion
toward him. The police have, been on-Tur
ner's trail ever since he left the city. Cap
tain Seymour had him tracked through
the ' Southern portion of the State,: send
ing pictures of the suspect to" all the Sher
iffs in the south. He received aJ tip yester
day that Turner was in the , vicinity of
Guadaloupe and he immediately notified
the town constable to look out for him.
The robbery of which Turner is suspect
ed ', was one of the boldest that has been
committed in this city-, for some time.
The thief removed a portion of the floor
of the ofllce of the shipyard, which was
high above the ground. It was the cash
ier's habit to' go. down to the bank every
Saturday to get the money to pay ,off the
employes of the yard, and upon returning
he generally put each man's salary -in an
envelope early in the afternoon and then
left the envelopes on his desk until he got
ready to pay the men their weekly salary.
On the day the robbery was committed
the cashier left the money on the desk,
locked the office and went out for a few
minutes to get some change. In his ab
sence the thief crawled through the open
ing in the floor and stole the envelopes
containing the money. So neatly was the
job done that absolutely no clew was left
upon which to trace the thief. The police
kept a strict tab on all of the employes of
the shipyard and when Turner failed to
return to work suspicion was at once di
rected toward him. - An. investigation de
veloped the fact that. Turner had fled, from
the city, leaving a young wife, who is suf
fering from consumption. This heartless
desertion of his wife strengthened Cap
tain Seymour's theory that Turner had
-committed the robbery.' â  , â 
Captain- Seymour Instructed the arrest
ing officers in Guadaloupe to seize all
money found in Turner's possession and
hold it until Detective Coleman arrives.
As the wet weather interfered with proper
telephonic communication the police could
not learn whether Turner s had any
money when arrested. Captain Seymour
says, he has other evidence of Turner's
guilt, which he will bring to light at the
proper time. Detective Coleman will leave
this morning for Guadaloupe to bring the
suspect back.
Brutal Son Punished.
Thomas Mahoney was . convicted by
Judge Cabaniss yesterday of the charge
of battery and was sentenced to six
months in the County Jail.' A few days
agcr he went- home drunk and demanded
money from his father,- James Mahoney,
a palsied man, 78 years of age, who lives
at 1147% Howard street. Because the .old
man said. he could not give it' to him the
son gave him an unmerciful beating. â¢ As
he was. leaving the courtroom the old man
slipped a' SO^centpfece into his- hand.
Kossuth Is Remembered.
The ..entertainment and ball to be given
by, the New Hungarian Mutual Aid Soci
ety in honor of the fiftieth anniversary
of the landing of Kossuth, the Hungarian
patriot, in the United States, which will
be given at Scottish Hall Sunday evening-,
December 8, promises to be an affair long
to be remembered. A fine programme has
been arranged and the affair will be
greatly enhanced by the performers
wearing, the costumes of Hungary.
Arrested* on Suspicion.
A man who gave the name of Joe Mc-
Donald was found prowling around the
room of F. D. Burgess at 629 Bush street.

planation of his being there he was taken

SENT FRELTO MEN!,
A Most Remarkable Remedy That
Quickly â¢ Restores Lost Vigor â ;;:
A Free Trial Package Sent by Mall
to All Who Write. \ ;;â¢â¢&;Â£*
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being matted to aU who
will writa the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had battled '
for years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the-Ingti-'
tute has 'decided to distribute free trial
packages -to, all who .write. It Is a homo
treatment, and all men who suffer: from
any fonriof sexual weakness resulting
from youthful' folly, premature loss ot
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
celo ; or' emaciation. oÂ£ parts can now curd
themselves at home. - " . .
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to. the desired, location, giving strength
and- development just where: it is -needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that coma
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in-
all cases. A request to -the State 1 Medical
Institute",' 32S : Elektron -bunding,
Wayne, Ind., stating that you desire ono
of their free trial packages;' will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who' are unable to leave home to ; ba
treajted. and the free samples will enable
them to see how easy it is to be cured of
sexual weakness â  when the -proper reme-
dies are 'employed. -The Institute makes
no restrictions. . Any man who writes will,
be sent a free sample, carefully sealed in
a plain package, so that its recipient, need
have no fear of embarrassment" or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write
without delay. ' ' ' '

WINTER MAIL
FOR ALASKANS
Government Is to Im
prove the Service in'
the Far North.
H. P. Thrall, superintendent of the
railway mail service, reports an impor
tant change and one for the better in
the service in the Alaska division. The
maii for St. Michael and Cape Nome dur
ing the winter season goes overland at
present from Skagway to the Yukon,
thence down the .river to the points
named, the trip occupying from forty to
sixty days. Trips are supposed to be
inacie weekly, but owing to the difficul
ties in-posea by the Arctic weather tne
schedule is very uncertain.
The Government has arranged for a
speedier and more certain service be
tween Seattle and Xome aud iSt. Michael
during the winter' mouths, and to that
tnd ha.s contracted wiih the Trans-
Alaskan Transportation' â  Company, of
"which Mr. Benael, formerly of the firm
of TiiUnaun & Bendel, and Frank Hanke
are the leading spirits. Unaer the terms
of the new contract the overland journey
will begin at Ilianna Bay, thence to the
Yukon River by way of Holy Cross Mis
sion to St. Michael and around Norton
Sound to Nome. The trip will be made
twice per month.
The water part of the contract haa
been let to the Northern Commercial
Company, which corporation will run the
steamer Bertha, and another contract has
been let with the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company for the services of the steamer
Excelsior, both from Seattle to Ilianna
Bay, two . trips monthly. The first trip
from Seattle will begin next Saturday,
the second trip on Christmas day and
thereafter on the 7th and 25th of each
month. These steamers will call at all
local ports on the way.
It is expected that under the new serv
ice all mail will be carried from Seattle
to Nome in four weeks* time and prob
ably less, depending upon the weather
Not to exceed 250 pounds of mail will be
taken on each trip, preference being
given to first class matter of small bulk
and then to first class rate prepaid mat
ter of larger bulk.
Angelus
Piano Player
The Angelus is a small instrument,
with stops and pedals in front ani
felt-covered hammers in back, which
rest on the keys of the piano. The
hammers finger the keys of the piano
playing each note as the music is
written. The performer pumps the
pedals and oserates the stops so 'in
reality he is the pianist, for he alone
regulates the time, .accent and touch
of the compositionâ in fact, he con-
trols the expression of the .music and
has the satisfaction of knowing that
he is producing it.
The simplicity of the Angelus makes
it possible for anybody to play the
piano like, a master, Â«ven though the
player does not know one note from
another. It affords complete mastery
of the piano without years and years
of hard practice at fingering.
But you must see the Angelus to
realize its wonderful achievements I*
is the only piano player with reeds
which give a piano with violin -or flute
accompaniment, organ or orchestral
effect.
You are cordially Invited to visit our
Angrelus rooms. Write for Catalogue

There are other valuables in the wreck

Insurance Hen Skeptical.
. Inquiry ; among > the insurance com
panies .yesterday developed that the
agents are not wildly enthusiastic over
the outlook. Scarcely, an agent could be
found who put any faith in the stories
of the finding; of the .wreck. Indeed, all
without exception expressed the belief
that the wreck would never be found,
and were it to" be the discovery would be
valueless for the reason that it lies at a
depth too great to permit divers to op
erate. This view is entertained by Vice
President Jacob B. Levlson of the Fire
man's Insurance Company, chairman of
the committee of .the underwriters which
conducted the negotiations for the re
covery and raising of the hull of the Rio
The Pacific Mail officials - regard with
some skepticism the reports of the find
ing of the hull. They asserted yesterday
that as far as the company was con
cerned they knew no more about the lo
cation of the wreck than on the day the
disaster, occurred. They â¢ expressed the
hope that the vessel would one day be
found, and that when found some practi
cal method of removing valuables there
from ; would â . be. advanced. â 
On 'the other hand; the officials of the
wrecking company,.; claim that their story
about finding the'- wreck Is no dreanL
They assert they have absolute proof of
Qiscoyery and that the only difficulty con

NULLIFIES SJATE
LUNACY LAW
Supreme Court Declares
It Provides No
Safeguard.
Any Sane Person Might Be
Sent to Asylum, Justices
Hold. :
The Supreme Court rendered a decision
yesterday â  which practically invalidates
the State lunacy, law passed in 189T. The
ground for this action is that the statute
in question makes it possible for a per
son to be deprived, of his liberty without
being given an opportunity to answer
the charges against him.
Habeas corpus proceedings were insti
tuted by W. H. Lambert, who is confined
in the Napa State Hospital for the In
sane. He alleges that a "friend" peti
tioned that he be sent to an asylum; that
two physicians declared he was non com
pos mentis and that Judge Buckles of
Solano County ordered his commitment.
Th.e^ first that he heard of what was go
ing on was when the Sheriff placed him
under arrest and took him to the hospital.
The court decided that any one else
might be "railroaded" to an asylum with
out a hearing, and that therefore the law
Is unconstitutional in that it deprives one
of his liberty without due process of law.
It is a primary principle of the United
States Government that a person must Do
heard before he is imprisoned.
The State lunacy law became a part of
the statutes March 31;- 1897. - It provides
that an application for a commitment to
an insane asylum must.be made by a rel
ative, friend or qualified official. The
application must be attended by a certifi
cate of lunacy signed : by two physjeiani
who are authorized medical examiners.
The Judge must then consider the case
and may commit the person charged with
insanity.
The number of physicians who "may be
come medical examiners Is unlimited.
Their testimony Is not given under oath,
nor do they administer oaths to witnesses.
A person is allowed to continue hunting
medical i examiners until he finds two of
them who will issue a certificate of lu
nacy. The court declares that under
these conditions any one may be sent to
an insane asylum.
In reference to the case in qutstiÂ»n
Justice Harrison, who writes the opin
ion, says:
The constitutional guaranty that a man
shall not be deprived of his liberty without due
process of law Is violated whenever any such
Judgment is had without giving him an op
portunity to be heard in defense of the charge.
It Is not enough that he may know by chance
that he is being tried on a charge of Insanity;
the law must require that notice to that effect
be given.
In- closing, the opinion reads as follows:
Under the foregoing considerations it must
be held that the insanity, law of 1S97, to thÂ«
extent that it authorizes the confinement of
a person in an Insane asylum without giving
him due notice and an opportunity to be heard
upon the charges against him, is unconstitu
tional and that the proceedings by virtue of
which the petitioner is held by the respondent
are invalid.
The court then orders the release of
Lambert. Justices Henshaw, Temple and
Chief Justice Beatty concur with Justice
Harrison.
Justice Garoutte writes the following
dissenting opinion: 5
Aa I read the foregoing opinion it renders
entirely void the present lunacy law. It is
hardly necessary to say that such grave re
sulta should be avoided If possible and that
no technical construction of this law should be
invoked which leads to such- serious conse
quences. . I believe a fair liberal construction
of the law may be had which will support Its
constitutionality, and for that reason I dissent
from the opinion of the court bearing upon
that branch of the case.

OIL CASE MAY
BE REOPENED
Railroad Attorneys Not
Satisfied With the
Result.
The Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe
Railway companies are not pleased with
the decision of the Railroad Commission
ers in the oil case. The attorneys in the
law departments are very guarded in dis
cussing the case, but from their tone it is
very evident that the result was not to
their liking. . '
"What steps they will take in the mat
ter they have not yet decided upon, but
from the present outlook it points to the
fact that they will bring the matter before
he Superior Court in this city and county
under injunction proceedings. â 
A prominent attorney of the Southern
Pacific Company, on being interviewed in
regard to the subject, said:
How do we like' the decision? "Well, we don't
want to talk about it just at present. We are
not satisfied with it, but just at present we
are thinking- the matter over and have not de
cided what steps we shall take about the case.
The only legal step we can take will be to
bring injunction proceedings In the Superior
Court in this city and county, but don't quote
me as saying i that we shall do this, as we
have the matter under advisement and have
not decided whether we shall take legal stepa
or not.
Attorney Short of Fresno, who con
ducted the case for the oil men of Kern
County, is jubilant over the decision. The
Railroad Commissioners ! made little
changes in the rates for the transporta
tion of oil from the .Kern district to this
city, but, on the other hand, the spur
charges, over which such a mighty pro
test was made, have been cut in half.
The question as to whether the railroad
companies will take the matter into the
Superior Court is arousing much inter
est. Should they take further legal ac
tion the case will not be settled for sev
eral months and perhaps years. If, in the
meantime, they secure an injunction re
storing the charges to the original figure,
they will be well satisfied.
Dismissal of Policemen.
City Attorney Lane advised the Police
Commission yesterday that the members
of the Police Department who came Â«in
under the charter are subject to and
protected by the provisions of the civil
service chapter of that instrument, but
that the Police Commissioners have
authority to dismiss members of the Po
lice Department without the approval of
the Civil Service Commissioners, inas
much as the charter provides a special
and extraordinary method governing dis
missals within the Police Department,
with which the Civil Service Commission
has no concern.
