THREATENED HOSTILITIES IN SOUTH AMERICA
"MAMMY" PLEASANT LAYS CLAIM
TO REAL ESTATE AND JEWELS
OWNED BY MRS. TERESA BELL
Attorney Frank M. Stone and Humorist Sam Davis of Carson City
Threaten to Bring* Sensational Suits Against Widow of Late
Capitalist and to Sue the' Donohoe-Keliy Banking Company
MAMMY" PLEASANT, or Mary
E. Pleasant, as she is legally
known, . is once more to be'
dragged into the light of day in
connection with the estate of
the late Thomas BelL
â¢Attorney Frank Stone of this city
tnd Sam Davis, the Carson City humor
ist, are threatening all kinds of law suits
aealriEt the estate of Thomas Bell and
the Donohoe-Kelly Banking Company on
behalf cf the aged colored woman who'
has been in the public eye for these many
years' past.
Lawyers, as a rule, do not reveal their
plans around newspaper offices, but
Stone and Davis were busily engaged yes
terday iu . telling "exclusive" etories to
representatives of the morning newspa
pers as to the suits they would bring for
Mrs. Pleasant to recover property worth
more than $300,000. The Call received an
"exclusive" story at the same time the
other newspapers did.
While the lawyer and the humorist were
engaged yesterday in drawing up some
legal papers asking Judge Troutt to re
move George R. Eaton as assignee of the
estate of Mrs. Pleasant, so that a friend
ly assignee might file tfie threatened suits
In law, statements were made by Stone
that the papers would show that a promi
nent lawyer and politician in this city
â¢would be agnsed of stealing diamonds be
longing to Mrs. Pleasant valued at more
than $100,000.
The amount of mystery that surround
ed the work of the lawyer and humorist
â was denser thati the heavy fog that hung
over the bay a few days ago. They would
give all kinds of hints as. to what they
intended to do, but when asked for ex
planations became silent.
Desire a Friendly Assignee.
The petition filed yesterday by â¢ Stone
for the removal of Eaton as assignee of
Mrs. Pleasant's estate was made return
able next Monday by Judge Troutt. It is
not thought, however, that Eaton will be
removed from his position on the mtr*
â¢Jleratlocs contained In the petition.

COLORED WOMAN WHO SEEKS TO OBTAIN PROPERTY VALUED AT
$500,000. AND THOMAS BELL'S WIDOW, WHO 31 AY BE MADE DE
FENDANT IN THE ACTION THAT IS THREATENED.
Sam Davis came down from Carson City
some time ago and has held many con
sultations with Attorney Stone and
"Mammy" Pleasant. The result of the
"councils of war" Is that the aged negress
claims, through Davis and Stone, that
she owns all the property in this city,
Sonoma County and Oakland which
stand3 recorded in the name of Mrs.
Teresa Bell, the widow of Thomas Bell,
who for many years employed "Mammy"
Pleasant as housekeeper. ,'
The business relations existing between
"Mammy" Pleasant and j Mr. and j Mrs.
Bell are well known in this community.
Mrs. Bell allowed her . colored house
keeper to attend to all her affairs, and in
this way large sums of money passed
through the hands of Mrs. Pleasant.
Stone exhibited a lot of old checks
yesterday, which he says will go to prove
that "Mammy" Pleasant had # for years
purchased real estate and Jewels and that
she was very wealthy long before she be
came the servant of Mr. and â¢ Mrs. â  Bell.
It is well known that. Thomas Bell gave,
his wife very valuable diamonds, and
some years ago, when in the throes of
litigation, Mrs. Bell had the jewels de
posited with the I>pnohoe-Kelly Banking
Company in the name of Mrs. Pleasant.
On an order signed by Mrs. Pleasant the
jewels were delivered to Mrs. Bell by the
bank. >*:/'";-''â 
"Mammy" Pleasant did not make any
statement yesterday that - thesa jewels

ever were . her personal property. The
presumptuous claim was made by Stone
and Davis, and it is not likely that these
worthies will ever come into court to
substantiate the assertion that a promi
nent lawyer and politician stole the gems
from the bank. \
Those who know the characteristics of
"Mammy" Pleasant readily realize that
the lates| move she Is making, with the
aid of Stone and Davis, savors of the
Impenetrable mystery that surrounded
the,"house of. mystery," which "Mammy"
Is claiming.
Mrs. Bell Eidicules Claims.
When Mrs. Teresa Bell was seen last
evening and told of the claims made on
"Mammy" Pleasant's behalf by Stone
and Davis she said:
I don't think that "Mammy" Pleasant will
ever dare to come Into court and swear to such
claims. If . she dees I will prove that every
dollar she has had in the past* thirty years she
received from Mr. Bell and myself. â  She never
had a dollar to her name before she entered
my employ.
It is really amusing to hear of such absurd
claims as these men are making- for "Mam
my" Pleasant. But I really have not the time
to waste on such fairy tales.' â " â  â  j
Attorney Blakeman, who represents
the Interests of Mrs. Bell, said last night:
I don't believe that any such suits will ever
be filed for Mrs. Pleasant. : I don't care to dls-

Hopeful Mood.

/ â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU.. 1406 O STREET, N.
W.; WASHINGTON, Dec' 12.â Chile hasu
formally expressed to the United States
her willingness that this Government
should use its good offices to maintain
pea:e in South America.'
Secretary Hay has cabled Minister Lord
at -Buenos Ayres, directing him to ac-
QUaint the Argentine Government, .-with
Chile's attitude and to say that under the
policy uniformly pursued by the United
States, it never tenders an offer of medi
ation unless assured in advance tnat j it
will be accepted. \
There is authority, for the statement
that Argentine will decline to permit the
intervention of the United States.
This briefly is the diplomatic situation
so far as the United States is concerned.
As to the condition of affairs at this
moment between Argentine and Chile
Senor Garcia Merou, the Argentine Minis
ter here, has received this dispatch from
the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Buenos
Ayres:
Argentine Is Hopeful.
â "â¢"At the present moment there is no.
reason for alarm. Argentine hopes that
the Government, of Chile will accept the
just claims made by the Argentine re
public in the matter of the construction
by Chile of roads in territory submitted
to arbitration.- Argentine thinks' thafthe
actual spirit of Chile is as it ought to be,
friendly and conciliatory."
Whether peace shall be preserved or
war declared will depend upon a confer
ence which- will - be â â¢ held to-morrow in
Santiago by the Chilean Minister for For
eign Affairs and the Argentine Minister.
The latter has been fully advised of the
attitutde of Argentine. She proposes to
obtain from Chile a full explanation and
strong assurances that the construction
of roads shall not continue, or it is, said
she will Withdraw her Minister. This
would be a rupture of diplomatic rela
tions and would greatly lessen the
chances of an amicable settlement
Merou insists that Argentine, is : fully
justified in observing the attitude she has
adopted/ but he is confident that there
will be an amicable outcome.
Infante, Chilean Charge d' Affaires, like
wise believes that â¢ the peace of South
America will not be broken, and . he re
gards Chile's announcement that she will
willingly accept the good offices of the
United States as a complete refutation of
the. charge that Chile is endeavoring to
provoke war and is acting aggressively
toward her neighbor.
Efforts to Preserve Peace.
Every effort consistent with American
dignity will be made by Secretary Hay to
preserve the peace. It was in accordance
with instructions made to him that Minis
ter Wilson approached Chile, and it was
in response to this suggestion that the
Chilean Government indicated a willing
ness to accept the good offices of the
United States. :
Argentine has not replied to the inti
mation'made through Minister Lord that
this Government is prepared to mediate
if both parties to' the dispute ask it. It
will be something of a surprise to the
administration to learn that Argentine is
not disposed to permit the intervention
of this or any other country. Argentine
holds that the dispute between herself
and _Chile is easy of adjustment . if ap
proached In a proper spirit, and she sees
no reason for foreign intervention. â  Chile
is absolutely , without a friend in South
America, while Bolivia and Peru are pre
pared to lend military and Uruguay and
Paraguay their moral support to Argen
tine
Chile Seeking Warships.
Although she is reported to be making
the effort, Chile will not be allowed to
purchase American warships' now in the
possession of the Government or under
construction at private shipyards.
Information ' reached . the Navy Depart
ment to-day indicating that Chile was"
endeavoring j to increase her fleet by so
curing warships in this country. No pro
posal has been made to Secretary Long
by the Chilean Government or any Chi
lean, agent. If it were, it .would be re
jected. ThelUnited States has no inten
tion of .selling any of its vessels or of
aiding v one South American republic In
preparing for a conflict with another. It
was polnted'out to-night that if this Gov
ernment ,were to sell a warship to Chile
or were to [even permit a contractor who
is building warships for the United States
to dispose of vessels "to. the Santiago pov
ernment; Argentine would; draw the nat
ural inference that the Ujiited States was
supporting her enemy. 'This would be an
unfortunate impression to create,' and one
which would seriously affect the' future
CASHIER FLEISHMAN SPEEDS
ON A TRAIN FROM EL PASO
TO A SEAPORT CITY OF MEXICO
Los Angeles Acquaintance of the Absconder Meets Him South of the
i Line and Texas Brokers .Identify His Photograph as That of
the Person to Whom They Had Sold a Railroad Ticket
EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 12.â It is now
certain that H.J. : Fleishman, the
absconding Los Angeles bank
cashier, passed through this city
and took the southbound Mexican
Central train for the coast. Conclusive
evidence â  of this fact was ' furnished to
day by David M. Shanks, an old friend of
Fleishman. Shanks staged to the police
authorities- that he met the absconder at
one of the small stations, south of this
city, shook hands with him and spoke to
him for a brief time.
Shanks is a prominent citizen of Los
Angeles. , He has known the cashier for
years and the two have. had many busi
ness dealings with each other. The meet
ing was purely accidental and Fleishman
upon seeing Shanks made a pretense of
not recognizing him, but upon the latter's
coming to him with hand outstretched the
defaulting bank official grasped the prof
fered hand and chatted with his ac
quaintance until the northbound . train
pulled out. s
No â  Mention of Crime.
Shanks was in total ignorance that
Fleishman had gotten av/ay with the
enormous sum from the Farmers'' arid
Merchants' Bank and no reference what
ever was made to the subject. . While the
two trains were waiting the time was
spent iu conversation. from which Shanks?
gleaned that everything was not as it
should be, and so stated upon joining ,tois
wife in the Pullman.
His suspicions be'ing aroused, the first
thing he did upon reaching El Paso was
to secure a copy of the Los Angeles
papers and for the first' time he learned
that Fleishman had absconded and that
he was being soaght by authorities all
over the United States. -, "Yes," sa'd
Shanks to-day, "I saw Fleishman no later
than day before yesterday. There .is no
question as' to my being mistaken, as I
have known the 'cashier for many years
and we- were on intimate terms. I hap
pened to meet him because of a small
wreck " below Tor reon, where the. two
trains were delayed, at a way station. I
was ,very much surprised to see him; In.
Mexico. At first' he did not wish to recog
nize me and attempted to overlook me en-
standing of the Lrnited States in South
American' affairs. Should it develop that
a contractor who is constructing Ameri
can war vessels is negotiating with Chile
for the sale of ships, he, has under, con
struction, the United States will undoubt
edly obtain an Injunction , from a court
having jurisdiction and thus prevent the
sale.
An Alliance With Colombia.

lombian Government officer, says that ac-

tirely, but when I approached and he
out my hand and spoke he responded.
Says He Is Tired.
â¢ "I asked what he was doing In. Mexico
and he replied he was tired out and
broken down tend was simply taking a
vacation. He further said that he was
going to Guadalajara, where he would
join some friends in the mining business
and perhaps be absent from California for
quite a while. He did not seem* to be in
the least disconcerted, although I sus
pected that there was something wrong.
"One thing that led me to believe that
everything was not right was on .account
of one remark he made. When we shook
hands upon parting he remarked:
" 'If you see any. of my friends in Cali
fornia, don't say that you saw me.'
"He was well dressed, but evidently had
not had a shave for a number of days,
as his beard was quite long. As soon as
I could get one, I bought a Los Angeles
paper and then for the first time found
out the truth of the situation."

cording to the latest news he has received
Chile . and Colombia have ' signed a treaty
of alliance. â¢' v
VALPARAISO, Chile. Dec. 12.â The first
symptom at the present juncture of a.
possible awakening of warlike excitement
among the Chilean public is the announce
ment that a mass meeting of .working
people, is to be held a f t Santiago Decem

of the Government in dealing with the

and diamond merchants, both fully Iden
tified Fleishman's picture to-day as that
of the man who purchased a lot of Mex
ican money and a railway ticket from
them Sunday morning. Robert Sllber
berg waited on the customer.
When he came' in Fleishman asked to
be given Mexican money for $400 in United
States currency. He did not ask the price
of silver nor dicker over the trade at all,
but seemed anxious to arrange for his
trip Into Mexico with as little loss of
time as possible. He told Silberberg that
he was going to the seaport town of Maz
atlan and asked the- best route to be
taken. It was inferred that he intended
to embark on a steamer at Mazatlan for
a South American port.
"I told him," said Silberberg, "to go
to Guadalajara and thence to Tepee, from
which place he could go overland to Maz
atlan. I suggested to him that I could
sell him a scalper's ticket to Guadalajara
in the name of W. T. Meyers. He seemed
pleased at the. idea that he could travel
under an assumed name and bought the
ticket without hesitation. Twenty min
utes later he must have taken the south
bound Mexican Central train." .
FRIENDS ABE BELIEVED.
News of the Bank Cashier's Where
abouts Ends Their Annoyances.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.â Definite in
formation of Fleishman's whereabouts",
received from El Paso, ha* rather dis
couraged those ' detectives who Insisted
that the absconder was still in hiding in
this city. But It has also brought relief
to certain of Fleishman's friends, who
have been subjected to no end of annoy
ance by having their apartments searched
at the most inopportune hours by detec
tives In the hope of finding the cashier
hid ien away.
Among these Is Mrs. Cunningham, the
"beauty doctor," who, despite her re
peated assertions that she knew nothing
whatever of Fleishman's movements since
last Friday, has been called upon many
times to tell of her acquaintance with
him. Mrs. Cunningham admits that she
knew Fleishman, but she says she did not
know him any better than she did other
gentlemen.
ly, is merely an offset to another meeting,
promoted by the advocates of peace at
any price. The buying of ships to taka
the. place of vessels of questionable effi
ciency, the mobilization of the fleet for
maneuvers and the strengthening of re
lations with friendly neighbors, Colombia
and Ecuador, are not regarded here as
signs of aggressive intentions on Chile's
part, but only as natural precautions
evoked by the unexpectedly threatening
demeanor of Argentine.2

CONSTANTINOPLE, Dec 12.â The
latest information regarding Miss Ellen
M. Stone, the American missionary, and
Madame Tsilka, her companion, indicates
that their condition has been, bo far
ameliorated that they are able to obtain
rude comforts* It is even said that the
brigands have a doctor ready at band in
case his -services should be needed. It
appears that the brigands are now com
lKaining that Miss Stone is attempting to
convert them to Christianity. .While rec
ognizing the Illegality of the * abduction
cf Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka, the
brigands contend that their action was in
the interest or a sacred cause, and there
tore, justifiable. ..
The bngands apparently-^are prepared
to hold out ail winter. They ; fefuse to
abate theii demands one dollar and have
not vouchsafed a reply to Dickinson's
ultimatum "to 'the ""effect that they "must
accept his last otter or nothing. It is
believed in well 'informed circles, how
ever, that were the gold actually prof
fered at some spot on the border by an
accredited emissary the brigands would
reduce the amount of the ransom.
It is understood here tha,t recommenda
tions have been forwarded to Washing

cuss the claims made for her, but I will say
that If ever any legal steps are taken there
will be no compromise. *-Â» *
Meanwhile "Mammy" Pleasant Is living
in a plain little house on Webster street,
and while Stone and Davis are hard .at
work giving out "exclusive" stories as io
what they intend to do, the notorious old
colored -woman' declines to receive visi
tors unless they are Introduced by "one
of the firm."
"Mammy" Is Uncommunicative.
Last evening a Call reporter was escort
ed to the home of "Mammy" Pleasant by
Sam Davis, after the humorist had fin
ished his day's work with his . associate
Stone.
Davis had a key to the dingy fiat at
2107 Webster street, where the old colored
woman lives. The house was shrouded
in darkness, but Davis assured the re
porter that "Mammy" was at home. Up
the dark stairs went Davis followed -by
the newspaper representative, and ' the
home of the concealer of. tragedies, com
edies and what not was entered.
Davis marched into the hallway and
banged at all the doors, but received no
response; Then the humorist used up all
his matches to peek through keyholes to
sec if "Mammy was around. The doors
were locked and, finally, when Davis was
about to give up thÂ£ hunt a young col-,
ored girl threw a door open, but the dim
light of a candle she held failed to- re
veal the -whereabouts of "Mammy."
"Hello," said Davis, "Is Mammy in?" .
"Yes," replied the girl, "step in here.
She will be down in a moment. V :'
Davla and the reporter entered the. room
and the colored girl put the candle on the
table and turned the reflector full on the
newspaper writer's face, so that It was
Impossible to see about the room.
The colored girl left the room saying,
that "Mammy would arrive in a- few
minutes. In order -to while away the
time Davis discussed the "former sur
roundings of Mrs. Pleasant, comparing
them to her present humble ones.
"Quite a contrast this ie," said â¢ Davis,
"but Mammy can accommodate herself to
surroundings, so I suppose she does not
mind. I have some of her pictures with
me. I hope that Mammy will like them,"
Negress Betrays Her Presence.
While Davis and the reporter discussed
the merits of the photographs there was
a giggle In the far corner of the. room,
and there lay; "Mammy"' Pleasant on a
lounge in the darkness. She had been in
the room all the time and had listened
to the discussion of her merits by Davia
and the reporter. . â¢ .
Although "Mammy" Pleasant is 87 year3
of age she has lost none of her old-time
cunning. She was pleasant and quite
talkative on all subjects except Â». the
threatened litigation.
"I -made my hit in life by 'keeping my
mouth shut. I have attorneys who us
ually.do a great deal of talking and very
little work, she said. ,.-r .
"Where are your attorneys, Mrs. Pleas
ant?"

MYSTIC SHBINEBS',. ELECTION.
Colonel C. H. Murphy Is Chosen Po-
tentate on % Seventh Ballot.
One of the closest and most exciting
elections ever held in Islam Temple of the
Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic
Shrine was that which was Concluded at
an early hour yesterday morning. During
the coming summer the Imperial Council
of this branch of Masonry will meet in
this city, therefore the position of poten
tate of the local shrine is of considerable
importance.
Four candidates presented themselves
the present moment; I have not called
them up by telephone for over an hour."
"And their names?"
"I think you will find, them in the di
rectory somewhere. 1 noticed their names
there a few. days ago. They were there
all right.
"I don't believe in trying cases in the
newspapers; I try my eases in the courts.
That 8 what the courts are for. I am a
happy woman to-night because I think
that the machinery of the law has been
put In motion to break up the conspiracy
that has been formed In this town to
clean me out of my property before I die."
Mammy Pleasant evidently thought she
had said enough about her own affairs;
In reality she had said nothing.
Â», Did any one ever get the best of you,
Mammy Pleasant?"
"Yes, I caught one fellow taking my
picture while he was talking to meâ I told
him to put his right hand in hi* pocket
and I saw that he kept it there and his
eyes on me-^but he got the picture. Just
the same."
"How's that?"
"He was left-handed and I was so In
terested in watching his right hand that
I did not know what his left was doing."
With this statement the aged negress,
who for so long guarded the portals of
the House of Mystery," the home of the
Bells, lapsed into her characteristic
silence, w hich seemed to better become
the weirdness of her surroundings. â¢-.- -\
BULLET HOLE SHOWS
HOW MURDER WAS DONE
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 12.â Interest
continues to center in the Griffiths mys
tery. The Grand Jury is now. hard at
work trying to unravel' what promises to
involve several people in the,cold-blood
ed murder. A number; of witnesses will
go before the Grand Jury and before the
end of the week It. is expected, that
startling facts will come to, light. , â¢â¢
Yesterday Charles Allen', Mrs. Jennie
Kelchcr, Mrs. Benfleld/ Mrs. Tpwnsend.
Mrs. Bigelow and . th<5 young- son of
Charles Allen were before â  the , Grand
Jury. It is understood that' facts not
heretofore brought out developed at the
proceedings, but what they. are cannot bÂ«
ascertained. One new and- vital piece of
evidence was discovered when a coat ana
shirt worn by Griffiths when murdered
wpre cleaned. :''
AbuUet-hoIe in the, coat,- below the left
shoulder, showed where the fatal ball en
tered. The blackened f cioth of the coat is
still In an excellent state of preservation,
and showed marka of powder Burns, prov
ing that. a weapon had been. pressed close
to Griffiths' side when the shot was fired.
As there was no bullet â¢ hole in the coat.
Sleeve the surgeons believe- with the of
ficers that the deceased had raised his
left arm to ward off a blow or to grasp
the muzzle of a gun when the shot was
fired. 'â  : â â :â â¢>; \\:

PLOT TO USE
PRICE OF LABOR
Iglesias and Associates
Are Found Guilty at
Porto Rico.
The Prisoners Are Released
â¢Pending an Appeal to the
Supreme Court.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Dec 12.âSan
tiago Iglesias, president of the Federation
of Workmen of Porto Rico, with nine
companions, was tried in the District
Court at San Juan yesterday on the
charge of conspiracy. To-day Iglesias
waa sentenced to two years and three.
month3 and eight days' imprisonment.*
Seven o! his' companions were sentenced
to four months' imprisonment, while two
were acquitted on the charge "of being the
founders of an illegal association and con
spiracy in August, 1900, to raise the price
of labor in Porto Rico. Iglesias, as the
founder of the conspiracy, gets the heavi
est sentence. . The other men were mere
ly his associates in the crime. Under
Spanish law, which is Still in force here,
persons' convicted of a crime have to pay
the costs. The local Federation of the
Workmen of Porto Rico, which 13 part
of the American Federation of Labor,
under the presidency of Samuel Gompers,
has been ordered dissolved, as it has Deen
adjudged illegal because of this con-
Judge" Savage of the District Court dls
sentea as to the Illegality oS the local
Federation, although he agreed that lgie
sias was guilty, ol a conspiracy to raise
the price of labor in August, 1900, when
the currency of Porto Rico was changed.
At that time nearly all the merchants ana
employers here raised their prices from
pesos to dollars, an, advance of 40 cents.
iglesias did the same, contending that he
only raised wages in proportion to other
increases. This constitutes the conspir-
The case has been appealed- to the Su
preme Court of Porto Kico, where it will
probably be heard In a month. Fending
this appeal Iglesias is at liberty.
The mass meeting of the Federation of
Labor called for next Sunday probably
will be called off, a3 the plans of the fed
eration axe temporarily deranged. Iglesias
says politics influenced the decision
against him, as the Judges belong to the
local Republican party, while Iglesias is
a Federalist. One of the acquitted men
has turned Republican, it is said, since
the time of the conspiracy.
Sinco Iglesias has been here as tho lo
cal organizer of the American Federation
of Labor he has been continually at
tacked in circulars and threatened by cer
tain Republicans who oppose his plans.
Last Tuesday night these Republicans
fired several shots at the building of the
federation. The police searched the rooms
of these men for arms, but . found noth-
The men who fired these shots had not
been arrested up to this morning. Iglesias
petitioned Governor Hunt, citing repeat
ed assaults upon his men, and asking for
protection. Iglesias Bald: "If the laws
of Porto Rico are Inadequate to punish
these offenders, if I cannot continue my
work of Americanizing Porto Rico labor
ers unmolested, please inform me, so that
I can return to the United States, aban
doning this country and my mission
here."

TO END LIFE
OF PASTOR
San Jose, Incendiaries
Attempt a Terrible
Crime.
Wood Ignited in the Base
ment of a Clergy
man's Home.
Young Son of a Presbyterian Minis
ter Saves the Family From
Possible Death, in the
Flames.
Esedal Dissjatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 12.â A dastardly at
tempt was made to burn the residence of
the Rev. R. F. Maclaren, pastor of the
Second Presbyterian Church, at 650 South
Second street, about 4:30 o'clock this
morning. From the preparations made It
was probably the intention of the incen
diaries to incinerate the clergyman and his
family. Only the awakening of Glover
Maclaren, a son, prevented the success of
the fiendish plan.
Fire had been started In a piano box in
the basement, in which was stored kind
ling wood and other inflammable mate
rial. Coal oil had been poured over this
and spattered on the adjoining walls. A
gas jet In the basement, which had not
been used for six months, was turned on
and left open, the intention undoubtedly
being that the escaping gas would aid the
flames and cause an explosion that would
wreck the building.
At about 4:30 o"clock Glover Maclaren
was awakened by a stifling sensation. His
room was filled with gas and smoke. He
aroused the family and turned in a fire
alarm. The fire was extinguished before
much damage was done.
There are no clews to the incendiaries,
but neighbors noticed a couple of men
hanging about the Maclaren house late
last evening.'
Dr. Maclaren Is one of the most promi
nent ministers in the city. He has con
ducted a crusade against the evils of the
city and has attracted a great deal of at
tention. He is unable to account for the
attempt to burn his home, unless his acts
have aroused -the enmity of some person.
CARS MAY RUN
UNDER THE BAY
Promoters Plan to Spend
Millions on Ferry-
System.
The long projected competing ferry sys
tem and submarine tunnel across the bay,
the plans for which were hertofore pub
lished in The Call, took a tangible form
yesterday when articles of incorpora
tion were filed in Oakland by the "San
Francisco and Piedmont Railway," the in .
corporators of which are the "Borax
King,",F. M. Smith, and the other mon
eyed men who are associated with him
in the Oakland Transit Company, the
Realty Syndicate and the recently
launched Oakland and San Jose Railway.
The capitalization of the new corpora
tion is J2.500.000. of which it is proposed
to spend $1,000,000 upon a tube or subma
rine way that is to lie beneath the watera
of the Bay of San Francisco. In the con
struction of cars and railroad and ter
minal it is the plan to spend $1,500,000 or
more if necessary.
Will Soon Begin Work.
According to the articles of Incorpora
tion the new road Is to extend from the
San Francisco water front to a point at
or near Leona Heigths, running in an
easterly direction, passing through Em
eryville, Oakland, Piedmont, and cover
ing altogether a distance of seventeen
miles. This line will be fed by the hun
dred miles of railway controlled by the
Oakland Transit Company, tapping every
populous place about the edges of the bay
and into the hills. The Improvement Is
expected to add greatly to the worth of
the properties of the Realty Syndicate.
Just what route the new road will fol
low from Leona Heights Is not known as
yet, even to the men behind it It will
be necessary to secure new franchises and
make connections with some of the lines

Monday. The revolutionists sent an expedition of 1 500' men. overland from Tumaco.
This expedition was. surprised at the river by the Government troops. Many casual
ties are reported by both sides. A small schooner arrived at Colon last night bearing many
sick Government soldiers from Viento Frio, and also bringing news that the Liberals were in
trenched at Nombre de DiasJ A Government force of ninety men landed at Isla Grande and
marched on Nombre de Dias to attack the Liberals.
SCHLEY RECEIVES BOTH CENSURE
AND PRAISE IN THE COURT'S FINDINGS
Will Decide That Admiral Vacillated Before the Battle of Santiago,
but Displayed Gallantry in j the Conflict. ; 5
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.-Rear.Ad
miral Winfleld Scott Schley will find both
censure and praise in the findings of the
court of inquiry, which. will be submitted
to Secretary Long to-morrow afternoon
or Saturday morning. :
The rear admiral will - be censured for
vacillation before the battle of Santiago,
and praised for the gallantry he displayed
in that conflict. The findings of the court
are about 3000 words long.- They will be
accompanied by a brief of the testimony,
of about 80,000 words, giving the important
evidence by each witness. This brief is
of the utmost importance, because It pre
sents the facts upon which. the findings
were drafted. .
There are ten specifications in the pre-1
cept, and the court has given' its opinion
upon each. No expectation is entertained
by the department that any recommenda
tion contemplating further proceedings
will be made. Such a recommendation
would be most embarrassing to the de
partment, which has no thought of or
desire to court-martial Rear Admiral
Schley, or any other oflicer.
No Cowardice Displayed.
The first specificationâ the conduct of
Rear Admiral Schley in connection with
the events of the Santiago campaignâ is so
broad that it practically covers the entire
campaign. Under It the court has dis
cussed Rear Admiral Schley' s conduct in
action, including the bombardment of the
Colon and the battle of Santiago, and It
absolves him from all charges of personal
cowardice.
The second specification is In relation to
the circumstances attending, reasons con
trolling and propriety of movements of
the flying squadron off Cienfuegos in May,
The court discusses in connection with
this specification Rear Admiral Schley's
assertion that he and some officers of his
flagship, the Brooklyn, heard the boom
of guns fired with the regularity of a sa
lute, indicating the arrival of the Spanish
fleet in Cienfuegos; the receipt by Rear
Admiral Schley of orders sent by Rear
Admiral Sampson by the Dupont and
Iowa that he should proceed to Santiago
if satisfied that the Spanish fleet was not
In the harbor of Cieqfuegos, and orders
sent by the Iowa directing him to proceed
with all dispatch, but cautiously, to Santi
ago; the failure of the commander of the
flying squadron to communicate with the
shore except by the steamer Adula, which
did not come out of the harbor until .the
arrival of the Marbjehead; the neglect of,
Captain McCalla,' commanding the
Marblehead, to communicate to Rear Ad
miral Schley the secret code of- signals
he had arranged with the insurgents, and
finally the display of the Anjois' signals
after the-squadron started for Santiago,
in violation of the instructions of Rear
Admiral Sampson that the squadron
should leave Cienfuegos without letting
the enemy know of his departure.
Find Cause for Censure.
The court, it is said, thinks Rear Admi
ral 'Schley shpuld have taken measures to
establish whether the Spanish ships were
In the harbor before the arrival of the
Marblehead.
The voyage from Cienfuegos to Santiago
is next discussed. The Judge advocate
general holds that Rear Admiral Schley
was not justified in proceeding so slowly
to Santiago. This is a point to which the
court does not, it is understood, attach
special Importance, because Rear Admiral
Schley's orders directed him to proceed
cautiously, and besides he had heavy
weather.
now in existence in order to run cars
through to Emeryville. It is planned to
have the cars run into Emeryville from
the outlying districts by way of Fortieth
street, In the neighborhood of which the
Realty Syndicate has recently made some
heavy purchases.
From Emeryville a pier constructed of
steel will extend into the bay to wh*t
Is designated the pierhead line, whidh Is
the limit established by the Government
for improvements into the bay.
Route as Yet Unknown.
The proposed tunnel is to be construct
ed from the end of the pier to the eastern
extremity of Yerba Buena or Goat Island
that is if the Government will give ita
permission for the use of the island for
railroad purposes. . Cars from the pier will
enter and emerge from the tubes by
means of gradual Inclines. After coming
out of the BUbway on the Island the cars
will run around to the western end, whera
a great terminal station is to be con
structed.
If the consent of the Government is not
obtained for the use of the Island tho
plans will be changed so that the tunnel
will emerge from the western shore lino.
Under this plan the tube will .be. two miles
long, while under the first named it whl
be but a mile and a half.
Whether or not the Government gives
Its consent the projectors plan to ro
ahead with the building of the ferry sys
tem, leaving the subway In abeyance until
the most favorable opportunity to build
it arrives. Ferry steamers will be con
tracted for and the steel pier built so that
the company can enter at once Into com
petition for the ferry travel.
Should Goat Island become the terminus
the ferry steamers will only have a til3
tance of one and a half miles to cover,
which will greatly lessen the danger from
fogs and accidents. One objection, how
ever, is the proximity of the Southern Pa
cific steamers.
As the cars in the tunnel could be made
to cover fifty miles an hour the proposi
tion of time will cut a big figure In the
bid for travel. Where the trip across the
bay now . consumes three-quarters of an
hour this road would reduce it to about
fifteen or elehteen minutes: â â '
The terminus of the road in this city
will be the ferry building: at â¢ the foot
of Market street, so that passengers will
have the same advantages they now have
from the railroad company.

Havens, who is the treasurer of the con

tion to begin work at once on the con
struction of the tracks, terminals and fer
ries.

There is, however, a very decided ex
pression of opinion upon the next three
precepts, which "all have a bearing upon
one event. The first relates to the circum
stances attending the arrival of the flying
squadron off, Santiago, the reasons for. its
retrogade turn westward and departure
from off Santiago. The. second related to
the disobedience of Rear Admiral Schley
of orders directing him' to proceed to San
tiago and not let the : Spanish fleet' leave
without decisive action and, third, to the
condition of the coal supply of the flying
squadron, its coaling facilities, the neces
sity. If any, or advisability of the return
of the squadron to Key West for'coal and
the accuracy and" propriety of pfHcial re
ports made by Rear Admiral Schley. with
respect to this matter. - â 
Rear Admiral Schley 'admitted 1 that : if
he had known the Spanish fleet' was in
Santiago harbor it would have- been pos
sible for his squadron to have blockaded
Santiago for a few days, beginning with
May 26, the day of his arrival twenty
miles south of that port, and still have
had coal enough to have reached Key
West.
The Retrograde Movement.

can sell the suits at retail for the same price as wholesalers must pay for the same quality.
The suits are union made and bear the label. They are guaranteed with a money-

ent reasons for the retrograde movement,
the only one he placed in his dispatch to
the department announcing his return to
Key West being, lack of coal.
It was shown that the 'ships of the
squadron coaled every day from the col
lier Merrimac,^except on those days when
they were actually under way, and that
at the time -of "arrival off "Santiago there
wa,s not a sufficient shortage of coal to
have alarmed a resourceful commander.
.During the inquiry the court asked Rear
Admiral Schley:
| "Did not the orders under which you
were acting require you to remain off
Santiago?" To which he responded:
. "Possibly, yes, but I do not think the
order given, me was to deprive me of all
discretion in the matter if I heard to the
contrary." â¢
1 There will be no disapproval of the loop
of the 'â¢ Brooklyn, and Rear. . Admiral
Schley's conduct during the battle has
met with the approval of the court.
The '.controversy with Lieutenant Com
mander-Hodgson over the tetter's charge
that Rear Admiral Schley said at the
time of the loop, "D â the Texas; let
her look out for herself," is said. In the
opinion of the court, not to be discredit
able to the rear admiral. .

Mammoth Water Pipe to Be
Run Through. Mountain

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. .Dec. 12.â Wha.fr
will be the largest and one of the moat
unique engineering works of Its class ever
undertaken In British Columbia will be
commenced within ten days near Van
couver. It is the building of a tunnel,
two miles and a half Ions, through a solid
mountain of rock.
The tunnel Is not for a railway, but for
a water pipe, which will be run from Lake
Beautiful, 2600 feet above sea level in the
mountains up Burrard Inlet from Van
couver to the head waters of Coquitlam
River, with the object of providing a
large water power plant to suply elec
tricity to the cities ox Vancouver and New
Westminster.
The scheme of the Vancouver Power
Company, a syndicate subsidiary to the
British Columbia Electric Railway Com
pany, owning all the tramlines In the
province, has been finally approved by
the Government and work will be started
immediately. .': â 'â â â â  ;â¢â â 'â Â»â .
The Coquitlam River is too_ small a
stream to supply by itself the needed
power, so that the tunnel from the lake,
over 500 feet above the present dam on
the Coquitlam is made necessary to give
all the power needed. The present outlet
of the lake runs in exactly the opposite
direction from that of the proposed tun
nel, which will be built three by eight
feet. The total cost of the tunnel will be
about $350,000, and It will add a practically
inexhaustible supply of water to the
smaller supply of the Coquitlam River.
â  The company pinna to spend about
JSOO.OOO during the- next year and will run
this plant as auxiliary to the present
steam plant, and probably in place of it
as soon as the works have been complete
ly installed. .

BY AUSTRALIAN CHAMPION
Knocked Out by the Saginaw Boxer After One of the : Fastest
Fighis Ever Seen Hereâ The Antipodean Opens First Choice
in Be ting, but Pressure of Lavigne Money Makes H'<m Favorite
QEORGE LAVIGNE knocked out
Tim Heagerty, the Australian
lightweight champion boxer,
after forty-nine seconds' fighting
in the fourth round of their bout
last night before the Acme Club, Oakland.
The fight was one of the fastest ever
seen here. This was in part due to Hea
gerty, who set a pace in the first round
and In part of the second which seemed
beyond human endurance to maintain.
His fast work was remarkable and he
flitted about the ring like a veritable will
o'-the-wisp. The Saginaw Kid was al
ways after him. continually boring in.
Heagerty had only one course open to
him and that was to mix things. No one
has ever been able to whip Lavigne, in
that way and the Australian proved no
exception to the rule. Had he been able
to keep away and let I^avigne fight him
self out" the result might have been dif
ferent.

dash and all his former ability to asslm-

about the mouth and his nose had a puffy
look when the battle was over. -For the
greater portion of , the fight the blows
followed one another so rapidly the eye
could hardly follow them. It was thought
Lavigne's vitality would give out at the
terrific pace at which the men fought.
He was a tired boxer when the end came,
but he had by. that time captured the big
end of the purse.
Lavigne devoted most attention to his
opponent's body, and in the second round
took much of the. fight out of Heagerty
by his blows there. In the third round
Heagerty staggered* Lavigne, shaking him
up considerably. He showed a clever left,
but made practically no use of his right.
The end came ea"rly In the fourth round.
Lavigne was the aggressor from the mo
ment the gong sounded.
He ripped in several rights and then
sent a clean right- to the jaw, which
knocked Heagerty to the floor. He took
seven seconds on the mat. When he stood
up he seemed dazed, but instead of clinch
ing to avoid punishment he started to ex
change blow for blow with Lavigne. The
latter had all his lighting spirit stirred
up and never allowed Heagerty a mo
ment's respite. He went at him hammer
and tongs and a second right-hand punch,
this time on the neck, sent the Australian
down and out.

BICYCEE BACEB8 ABE
IN GOOD CONDITION
Physicians Say the Terrible Strain Is
, Telling on Their Nervous
â¢ Systems.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â At the begtnning
of the last half of the six-day bicyple
race, with its attendant spills and the ner
vous pension of the ;, riders strained .to
breaking point, the interest of the public
Is greatly on "the increase. This was ap
parent from the presence of. 15,000 people
In Madison-square Garden to-night. The
1700-mile mark in the race was passed at
6:26 p.' ra. In the ninety-secend hour of
the race the men covered fifteen miles and
three laps, while In the s.ame hour of the
record score Miller and "Waller made six
teen miles and four laps. At 8 o'clock the
men -were were 87- miles 4 laps behind the
record.
-All the racers were examined by physi
cians in the evening and were pronounced
to be In good condition. The physical con
dition of Babcock and Turvlile Is excep
tionally good and that team^is looming up
as a decided factor in the race > for first
money. The doctors admit that the ter
rible strain had affected the nervous sys
tems of all the men. â â¢: â 
Early In the- evening the trainers of Mc-
Eachern and -Walthour .agreed to with
draw their- protest -against the referee's
decision which refused them the lap they
declared they had gained during the aft
ernoon. It was because â  of this decision
that JlcEachern threatened to quit, the
race.
A* one-mile match, best two in three

THE SAN FRANCISCO- CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 11901
majority of the spectators being from
this city. Nearly all the well-known
sporting men were present, hardly a
familiar face being missing. The show
ing made by Lavigne was the chief topic
of conversation on the return to this city.
Harry Corbett; "Young Mitchell/' Jack
Welsh and other authorities on boxing
were all surprised and pleased at the
showing made by the "Kid" after his
long retirement from the ring. /
On Wednesday the "men who wanted to
bet on Heagerty could find" no takers. In'
their eagerness they made the Australian
a 10 to 7 favorite. These odds prevailed
until last evening when â¢ Lavigne's ad
mirers commenced to offer their money.
He was quickly installed favorite at 10
to 7, some 2 to 1 bets being recorded. The
wagering on the fight was comparatively
light., ,. â  :" " .
The men weighed in at 3 o'clock. Heag
erty tipped tlie beam at 128 pounds in his
fighting rig, while. .Lavigne weighed 130
pounds with a" sweater on in addition to
his ring costume. Lavigne was seconded
by Charley Long, Jimmy Lawler and Ted
dy Alexander, while Heagerty had toe
services of Australian Billy Smith, Arthur
Crlbb and Jack Hill; , ...
When the men entered the ring Heager
ty had light tape bandages on his hands,
to which Lavigne's seconds made objec
tion. He removed them at â¢ once. Both
men are about the same height, but La
vigne seemed much the stouter built of
Arthur SImms and Jack O'Brien each
challenged the winner and it is- probable
a bout will be arranged between Lavigne;
and one of them for next month. Jack
Kitcher refereed all the fights. \
Preliminaries End Quickly.
The first preliminary between Kid Mar
tin of New Jersey and Jack Ritter of
Oakland was farce comedy from start to
finish. In the third round the New Jer
sey boy found a soft spot on the canvas,
lay down and after the count of ten Im
posed upon his seconds the duty of carry
ing him to his corner.
In the second preliminary Jim Brown,
probably the darkest colored fighter ever
in -a ring, knocked out Jack Murphy in
the second round. The light was rough
and tumble and lively as far as it went.
-A -stiff right and left on -the jaw termi
nated the bout.
BASEBALL MAGNATES,
: ABE UNABLE TO AGREE
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â An . absolute
deadlock exists over the selection of a
president of the National League to suc
ceed N. E. Young, and the â . magnates of
the league only argued the day away at
the . Fifth Avenue Hotel. As announced
by President Young at the conclusion of
the day session, "no basebali history will
be made as the outcome of the argu
ment.''
Several meetings were held to-day. The
first was called at 8 o'clock and lasted
until C. The evening session began at S
o'clock and was not over until â¢ late to
night. â¢ â¢ , . .. : ' .
"Merely a reminiscence meeting,'.' was
the way-one of . the men referred to the
heated debate of three hours which oc
curred this afternoon. It was said, how
ever, that the "syndicate baseball
scheme," which was defeated yesterday,
was â  brought â  up again â  to-day, and that
over this the magnates argued pro ' and
con, John T. Brush leading in- the debate.
Strenuously opposed to this measure were
the Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Pittsburg
and Chicago magnates. Behind Brush
were arrayed the. men from Boston, New
York and St. Louis. The chances that
the Brush combination will win' a vic
tory are said to ,be very small. It is be
lieved that some kind of compromise is
all that Brush caw expect.

WADDELL TOYS
WITH CRIPPLES
O^kl&nds^Play Poor Ball
and. Are Outclassed
by Americans.
Laj pie Makes His Initial
Hit Off Moskiman's
Delivery.
Ewing's j "all-star cripples" essayed- to
engage America's finest in nine rounds of
what was advertised to be baseball yes
terday afternoon at Recreation grounds.
The spectators, however, -were divided in
their opinion -'as "to whether if was a ball
game or merely a posing stunt on the part
of the tossers-fromâOver the Pike," with
Vaddell, the alleged "rube," in the role
of the prize beauty. The Oakland Dudes
seemed afraid to come in contact with
the sphere either on the field or at the
bat. "Red Dog" Deyereaux, he who once
captained the Senators, made an attempt
to play shortstop. Bill forgot to let out
his usual war whoop, and as a conse
quence playfully let a baby grounder tad
pie through him when, three were on the
sacks and two were out. This meant two
easy ones for'Cantlllion's men, and then
ana there they began to do a variety vof
tmngs to the cripples. â '
William B. Ivioskiman, M.D., who. Is
wise' in medical lore ana sometimes In
baseball, was unanimously chosen to pass
a few to the big league men. 'me doctor
delivered the goods in a creditable enough
manner, but tne men behind him seemed
afraid that if perchance they should win
they would all be in demand by Eastern
magnates, and as none of them were de
sirous of leaving their happy homes they
decided , to lose. The most peculiar fea
ture . of the game was that Lajoie actu
ally got a hit, though really it was only
half a hit, as. Devereaux was slow in
throwing the ball to first. Nevertheless,
it made both Lajoie and the crowd feel
good, and rumor has it that ha bought
all -the boys a drink in order to fittingly
celebrate the occasion.
In the second inning Bradley found the
ball for two stations and scored on Bar
rett's single. However, it remained for
the third to furnish the fun. With three
on the bases. and two gone Davis hit an
easy one to Devereaux, who let the ball
pass him, and two runs resulted. This
unnerved the' doctor, - and before he re
covered his composure the All-Americans
fell on him for five 'hits and four more
points. â â â  : \
The Eastern stars sent six more over
the route in the fifth, sixth, seventh and
eighth rounds. This was accomplished by
means of a few hits, but mainly through
the misplays and rank errors of Ewing's
men. In the eighth Davis hit, stole sec
ond and third and came home on a little
drive- by Bradley to Dunleavy, which the
latter could easily have thrown home,
cutting off the run. It was a most fool
ish play on the part of Dunleavy, who
seemed to have lost his head completely.
The admirers of Oakland were made
glad when in the ninth round the Dudes
made a last rally and . saved themselves
from a complete whitewash. With two
gone, Strleb accepted a pass to the ini
tial sack and dame around on "Truck"
Eagan's smashing three-bagger to deep
right field. Moskinian had a chance to
bring "Truck" in, but he flew out to cen
ter and ended.it all. " ."
Waddell, "the only Rube," did not use
such terrific speed as he did on Sunday;
but still he was a great mystery. When
he- did let himself out .the cripples struck
out as he willed. Moskiman's control was
npt up to his standard, as he walked fiye
men, r something very unusual, consider
ing that the doctor ha3 the best control
of any pitcher in the league. Old Pete
Lohman threw to â  second â  in his old-time
form, catching four of the fleet-footed
Americans trying to steal. The score:

O'CONNOR DOES GREAT WORK
IN THE SADDLE AT OAKLAND
Lou Clieveden, a 50 to I Outsider, Beats Pat Morrissey for the
Opening Sprintâ Bedeck Takes Another Purse From a Fair Lot.
Andrisa Outsprints, Her Fieldâ Romany Disqualified for Fouling
PROBABLY Winnie O'Connor's
riding was the moat fetching fea
, turejn connection with the rac
ing at Oakland yesterday. The
â¢â¢ . â¢ actor-pugilist-jockey put three
winners over the plate in Milas. Bedeck
and Andrisa and received a rousing re
ception from the crowd on each occasion.
Winnie may : not be a crack mud rider,
but he is, assuredly a virtuoso on a dry
track. â¢ -â â¢ .' â¢â .-â¢â â â¢
Aside from the New York boy's clever
saddle work, the only bewildering stunts
were the victories of Lou Clieveden at 40
and 50 to.l and the disqualification of
Romany in the last event in favor of
Whaleback, ! another long-priced horse.
Bedeck was the only successful choice. .
) It begins to look as if Frank Phillips'
sprinter Alfred C was not what he was
cracked up to be. Booked an 11 to 10
choice for the Introductory sprint, the
Golden Garter horse ran unplaced. Lead-
Ing from the start, Lou Clieveden, the
rankest of outsiders, disposed of Pat Mor
rissey by half a. length. â  â¢
â â¢Following this came a cheap mile sell
ing, affair. Windward, piloted by Vitta
froe, finished a length ahead of Mont
Eagle at the wire. The favorite. Mission,
displayed no marked amount of speed
and was unplaced.
O'Connor astride Milas, the Jennings
entry, captured the - two-year-old sprint.
The colt had his odds played down from
4 to 13 to. 6, .'and, -'-taking the lead in the
stretch, beat Be'ndara without much ef
fort. Sol,' the favorite, never seemed ca
pable of reaching the firing line.
A high roller in his line, Bedeck con
tinues to strike soft spots in the selling
plater class. O'Connor brought him along
from "away back" in the seven furlong
run and beat Rollick a length. Jim Halo
was touted, but ran as if a bit new. Bed
ner and Orleans found the company
somewhat too refined. -
So badly has he gone back in his sad
dle work that it begins to look as if Hoar
couldn't ride a work horse up to the town
pump. He had the leg up on Byron Rose,
favorite for the fifth number at six fur
longs, and began making his run on the
far turn. O'Connor took matters quietly
with Andrisa, winning with pounds to
spare by two lengths. . Our Lizzie finished
third.
Romany downed Whaleback a length
for the closing mile run and was disqual
ified. This placed Whaleback, a 20 to 1
shot, first arid gave second money to
Meadow Lark.. Torsida, the favorite,
showed little speed.
Track Notes.
' Marty Dunn, a very promising light
weight, arrived from, the East last even
ing and will ride the horses of the New-
York turfman, L. V. Bell. Dunn was
formerly an exercise lad in the employ
of Barney Schreiber.
â¢Bab had worked great guns at Ingle
side, ran a corking race and ought to be
hard to beat next time out.
It is about time the entry of Mike
Strauss was refused. It Is only a ques
tion of time when he will fall down and
cause a very bad accident.
Ransom rode Pompino yesterday, and
when a capable rider is put up the geld
ing Is worth a bet.
Our Lizzie showed much of her old-time
speed in the fifth recital and will do
about next time. Adams rode yesterday,
and if the tide is right , Jackson or som j
other good rider will grab the tiller soon.

CONFRONT LABOR
Leaders at the Scranton
Convention Become
Irritable.
Socialists and Trade Union
ists Indulge in Some
Angry Talk. Â«
SCRAXTOX. Pa.. Dec. 12.â Much life
was infused Into .to-day's proceedings of
the convention of the American Federa
tion of Labor. The negro problem In the
South, as far as it related to unionism,
vas unexpectedly Injected Into the pro
ceedings and the long standing conflict
between the socialists and trade unionists
promised to monopolize the attention of
the delegates in consequence of the so
cialists' replies to the trade unionists.
The Questions of organizing common la
borers into a national union and of throw
ing out of unions all organizations allied
with city, State, national or International
unions if they refuse to affiliate with the
federation of Labor were also vigorously
debated.
â¢The Bodalist incident came up at the
morning session during the discussion of
a. committee report indorsing most of the
recommendations contained in President
Gompers' annual report. JJ. A. Hayes of
Philadelphia, national president of the
Glass Bottle Blowers, and Max Hayes of
the Cleveland Central Labor Union, the
well known socialist, made speeches
etrongly urging the enforcement of laws
prohibiting child labor. The latter during
his remaxKs read a long list of decisions
rendered by Federal and State courts
against organized labor.
A motion to have the list printed in the
minutes brought President Gompers, who
was not in the chair at the time, to his
feet, and the delegates were treated to a
three-minute passionate speech. He said
it was unfair to incorporate the list in
the minutes in that way, and suggested
that a list of the trade union victories
ehould be printed along Â»-ith it. He con
cluded by denouncing the "attempt to
show that trade unionism is a failure,"
and characterized it as an outrage.
a wave of applause swept over the con
vention as Gompers took his seat. The
motion was defeated after W. B. Wilson
of the miners had spoken along the same
lines as Gompers. The recommendations
of President Gompers were adopted, ex
cept the one referring to a. general de
fense fund.
The committee's suggestion that the
fund be raised by national and labor
unions instead of by the American Fed
eration of Labor was adopted. _,
The Pacific Coast delegates fought
among themselves the proposition to drop
all unions from State, national or inter
national unions unless they join the
American Federation of Labor. The
measure was particularly aimed at the
San Francisco Building Trades, -which is
at odds with the Central Labor Union of
that city.
The committee on laws recommended
that the matter be dropped on the ground
that such a step would be unwise, and
the convention adopted the recommenda
tion.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
WHAT GOES UP
Must Come Down.
Nothing- is more certain than that the
use of so-called tonics, stimulants and
medicines, which depend upon alcohol for
their effect, is injurious to health in the
\r:Tig run.
â What goes np must come down and the
elevation of spirits, the temporary exhil-
aration resulting from a dose of medicine
ccntaining alcohol, will certainly be fol-
lowed in a few hours by a corresponding
depression to relieve which another dose
must be taken.
In other words, many liquid patent med-
icines derive their effect entirely from
the alcohol they contain.
Alcohol and medicines containing it are
temporary stlmulantB and not in any
fense a true tonic. In fact it is doubtful
If any medicine or drug is a real tonic.
A true tonic ia something which will re-
new, replenish, build up the exhausted
nervous system and wasted tissues of the
body, something that will enrich the blood
and endow it with the proper proportions
of red and white corpuscles, which pre-
vent or destroy disease germs. This is
what a real tonic should do and no drug
or alcoholic stimulant will do It
The only true tonic In nature is whole-
some food, thoroughly digested. Every
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of blood Is created
daily from the food we digest.
The mere eating of food has little to do
with the repair of wastÂ© tissue, but the
perfect fiigrestion of the food eaten has
everything to do with it.
The reason so few people have perfect
digestion is because from wrong habits of
living the stomach has gradually lost the
power to secrete the gastric Juice, pep-
tones and adds in sufficient Quantity.
To cure Indigestion and stomach
troubles It is necessary to take after
meals some harmless preparation which
â¢will supply the natural peptone and dias-
tase â which every weak stomach lacks,
and probably the best preparation of this
character is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
which may be found in every drug store
and which contain In pleasant palatable
form the wholesome peptofte and diastase
which- nature requires for prompt diges-
tion.
One or two of these excellent tablets
taken after meals -will prevent souring',
fermentation and acidity and insure. com-
plete digestion and assimilation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are equally
valuable for little children as for adults,
as they contain nothing harmful or stim-
ulating, but only the natural digestives.
One of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
digest 1S00 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and they are In every
eense a genuine tonic because they bring
about in the only natural way a restora-
tive of nerve power, a building up of lost
tissue 'and appetite, in the only way it
can be done by the digestion and assimi-
lation of wholesome food.

SENATORS FAVOR
THE NEW TREATY
Monday the Day Set for
Vote on the Canal
Measure.
Arguments Advanced to Show
This Country Has Right
to Fortify Waterway.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â The Senate
agreed to-day to take k .vote before ad
journment on Monday on" the new Hay-
Pauncefote treaty for the abrogation of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and opening
the way for the construction of a canal
across the isthmus of Panama by the
United States. This agreement was
reached after four hours of debate suffi
ciently interesting to assure the constant
attention of most of the Senators.
Senator Spooner, who was one. of the
principal speakers of the day, had just
concluded when Senator Lodge made an
effort to Eecure a vote. It developed that
there were other Senators .who'desired to
be heard, the result being that the date
for the vote was postponed until Monday.
The agreement provides for an adjourn
ment of the Senate from to-day until
Monday and for a meeting at 11 o'clock on
that day, one hour in advance of the
usual time. The understanding is that as
soon as practicable after the Senate con
venes Senator Lodge shall move an execu
tive session and that the treaty shall
have the entire attention of the Senate
until a final vote is reached before the
adjournment for that day.
Arguments Favor Treaty.
The principal speakers to-day * beside
Senator Spooner were Senator Money and
Senator Foraker. Money, while finding
much in the treaty to criticize, said that
as, he found the fortunes of the proposed
canal across the isthmus inextricably in
tertwined with the treaty he could not see
way clear to do anything that would pre
vent or even delay ratification. The par
ticular features or the new treaty with
which he found fault were those retaining
the neutrality provision of the Clayton-
Bulwer convention and specifying police
control of the canal when built. He ar
gued that the effect of these provisions
inevitably must be to limit and prescribe
the power of the United States to control
its own property in case o^war.
Senator Foraker maintained that provi
sions of the new treaty meet every objec
tion made to the original Hay-Pauncefote
treaty and cover every essential thing
that was included in the amendments
made by the Senate to that document. He
regarded it as of the utmost importance
that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty should be
wiped out. This result was effected by
the convention under consideration. He
asserted that all' rights of the United
States were amply protected under this
treaty and that our absolute and complete
control of the canal cojuld not be ques
tioned by Great Britain . or any othet
power.
Foraker's speech dealt largely with the
legal construction and the general effect
of the treaty. He said that after a care
ful study or its provisions he was firmly
convinced that it could be honestly sup
ported by every patriotic citizen.
Bacon. Asks Questions.
Senator Foraker. was frequently inter
rupted by Senator Bacon. In the course
of one of these interruptions Bacon asked
if it was not true that under the terms of
the treaty the construction of fortifica
tions by the United States would be an
act of war.
Foraker replied In the negative, declar
ing that not only would such an act not
be an act of hostility, but that to build
fortifications in case of necessity was one
of the inherent rights of the Government.
To this Bacon responded that he, for
one, would never bring himself, to vote
for the ratification of the treaty with the
understanding that his Government was
to violate it.
Foraker retorted 'sharply to the effect
that his friend from Georgia could be no
more virtuous along the lines of main
taining the country's honor in the way of
keeping Its agreements with other na
tions than were other Senators.
Bacon replied that he had not meant to
assume a virtue that he did not possess
nor to Imply that other Senators were not
as Jealous of the country's good name as
he himself.
Foraker then declared that he had not
meant to charge Bacon with an unfair
assumption, but simply to say that like
all other Senators supporting the treaty
he felt ho was giving his name to a trans
action which would be honorably carried
out between nations.
Senator Spooner, who folio-wed, also was
frequently Interrupted by Senators on the
Democratic side. One of the first inter
ruptions came from Senator Bacon and
pertained to the right of fortifying the
canal. Replying to this Inquiry Spooner
said that it was a well-known principle
of international law that all treaties, like
all statutes, must be read together, and
he contended in this connection that the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, the original Hay-
Pauncefote treaty and the pending treaty
for the proper construction of the agree
ment should be considered as one series.
Fortification of the Canal.
The Clayton-Bulwer agreement had pro
vided that there should be no fortification
of the canal and the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty of the Fifty-sixth Congress had
carried a similar provision, but the new
treaty struck out the entire fortifications
provision, clearly showing that England,
after contending for half a century
against fortifications, had waived that
provision, thus practically conceding our
right to fortify the proposed canal.
Questions were asked by Senators Till
man and Bailey concerning the right of
the United States to blockade tho canal
and in reply Senator Spooner insisted that
the Government <jf the United States
could not be bound by any treaty agree
ment which would prevent this- country
defending its own - property in its own
way in time - of war. Senator Tillxnan
pressed the inquiry somewhat and he and
Spooner engaged in a somewhat spirited
colloquy, which, as usual, with them,
ended good-naturedly.
A very important question was raised by
a number of /Senators on the Democratic
side as to the right of the United State3
to give differential . rates to vessels en
gaged in our coastwise trade. Tills mat
ter brought other Senators from, the Re
publican side of the chamber into the
controversy.
Senators Perkins and Nelson were
among those who contributed to this feat
ure of- the controversy. Senator Nelson
Insisted that under existing law the
United States would have a perfect right
to give to the coastwise trade of this
country any benefit it might seen proper
In the use of the canal. It was perfectly
well understood, he said, that the ships
of a foreign nation could not do a coast
wise business and Great Britain had made
the treaty with the full knowledge of this
fact
Senator Perkins made the assertion that
by the acquisition or control of a strip
of territory through which the canal
â would pass the United States -would ac
quire rights which would subject that ter
ritory to our coastwise laws and said for
eign bottoms could not trade between
ports of the United States and any portion
of the territory through which the canal
was built.
This view was combated by Senators
Tillman pnd Bacon, the former intimating
that if that were true, relative to the
United States. Great Britain, on account
of her Canadian possessions and Mexico,
both extending from ocean to ocean, also
could contend for similar privileges. Th's,
he thought, also would be true of any
South American country whose territory
ey tends from ocean to ocean.
Senator Spooner was decidedly of a con
trary oninion and ins'sted that tbÂ»se coun
tries did not pcqutre any rights of a coast
wise trade oharae'er alo^gr thÂ«Â» route of
the prnnosed canal, which territory was
urtÂ«1er the 'â¢on^'-ol of or which "light be

<>xten<*s from oooqn to ocean wouM not

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, lÂ»01.
KNOWLTONI FACES
MANY ACCUSERS
The School Board Hears
Charges Against
Him.
Frincipal Lyser Testifies Pio
\ neer Teacher Is Incom
petent.
. The investigation of the charges of in
competency preferred by Albert Lyser,
principal of the John Sweet Grammar
School, against Ebcnezer Knowlton, was
begun by< the Board of Education yes
terday. Lyser was a conspicuous fig
ure during the hearing, as was also
Mrs. Kincaid who, as a member of the
board, spent her time profitably with her
knitting needle as she listened to the
testimony against the pioneer educator
and of the importance of which she ia to
judge./
Lyse'r testified thai Knowlton' s disci
pline was bad and that his methods ot
teaching were worse. One day the wit
ness went into Knowlton's class room and
was amazed to find that none of the pupils
was able to answer his query* as to "what
effect altitude had upon temperature."
Attorney H. C. McPike floored Lyser
when he brought ou,t the fact that the
pupils in question had been taught under
nis supervision for seven years, and that
at the time of his catechism Knowlton
had been in charge of the class only two
months. Lyser's testimony was in effect
that Knowlton was a great talker; that
he lectured his girl pupils on the 'subject
of rings, and the number they should
wear, and that he once told them- that in
his youth he was the champion candy
eater of his class.
. Frank Morton, principal of the Lowell
High School, regarded Knowlton as being
incomoetent to serve as teacher. Princi
pal Hamilton of the Lincoln Grammar
School said that in his judgment Knowl
ton was a fair teacher. F. H. Clark, head
of the department of history in the Lowell
School, testified that the interests of the
schools would be advanced if Knowlton
were no longer connected with the depart
ment. It developed under cross-examina
tion that Clark was the author of a his
tory of the United States, which is one
of the California v text books, and that
Knowlton had incurred Clark's hostility
by eriticizlns it.
"Can you show In your history whether
or not the United States is in North
America?" asked McPike.
Clark admitted reluctantly that his book
was bad and that he did not claim its
authorship among intelligent people.
"Does your history give the area of the
United States?"
"That history is not on trial," said
Chairman Casserly.
"We desire merely to show the animus
of this charge against Mr. Knowlton." re
sponded McPike. "Knowlton criticized
Clark's history, and perhaps that fact
may have had some effect upon Clark's
judgment as to Knowlton's ability as an
educator."
"When Clark's testimony was finished
Chairman Casserly announced that the
"persecution" of Knowlton was finished,
and when he corrected himself by saying
"prosecution" a general laugh followed.
McPike hinted that the first term might
be deemd proper by some people, but
Casserly made no reply. McPike then
asked that the charcres be dismissed for
lack of proof, but this was promptly de
nied by Casserly. The defense then an
nounced that if given time witnesses
would be produced In Knowlton's behalf.
The matter then went over until next
Tuesday at 9 o'clock a. m.. at which time
Knowlton will offer testimony in his own
behalf.

MILD SENTENCE
FOR INSPECTORS
Collector Stratton Finds
Against Customs ;
Officers. - . ,
The- three customs Inspectors who, after
arresting two smugglers, went on a trip
through water front saloons, drinking and
smoking with the prisoners, and then re
leased their captives on their own recog
nizance for nearly two days have been
found guilty of disobedience of orders and
have been sentenced to forfeit ten days'
pay and to take a vacation for that pe
riod. Customs Collector Stratton took ac
tion yesterday and set forth the verdict
and sentence In a letter. The Collector
says:
I believe from the evidence taken by me
that Inspector Peppln U,isobeyed orders in not
taking two prisoners, Joseph and George Alex
ander, to the County Jail, as per Instructions,
and leaving them in custody there. Notwith
standing hla knowledge of the law he per
mitted himself to be controlled In the matter
both by his feelings and by the advice of
others. â¢ According to the evidence, since it was
somewhat late Saturday evening, the inspectors
permitted both prisoners to leave on their own
recognizance without formal arrest or confine
ment in jail upon their promise to deliver
themselves into custody on Monday I morning.
The prisoners did so report at the time and
hour agreed upon and were then, on the Mon
day following, charged with the crime of
smuggling.
Inspector". Broderlck, I find from the evi
dence, was somewhat under the influence of
liquor when he assisted in taking the prison
ers to the County Jail. He further took drinks
with the prisoners subsequent to the arrest.
Inspector Clifford took one drink with the
prisoners after the arrest. Inspector Peppln
did not drink, but took a cigar. The prisoners
â went â¢ into the custody of the inspectors about
7 p. m., and, according to the evidence, they
reported back for duty at the Mall dock at
10:15 or 10:30 on that evening.
The, special agents of the treasury have
made a report of the Incident to the Sec-
retary of the Treasury and It la likely
that an example will be made of the of
fenders.
RUNAWAY KNOCKS DOWN
AGED WOMAN AND CHILD
Horse Causes Excitement on. Market
Street and Dashes Into Na
tive Sons' Monument.
In an exciting runaway, which â  occurred
yesterday afternoon on Market street,
between Fifth and Eighth, an elderly wo
man, who was wheeling a child In a baby
carriage, had a very narrow escape from
being seriously injured. She was knocked
down by the runaway horse and the baby
carriage was overturned, but neither the
child nor the woman received any injury
further than a slight shaking up.
The horse and light wagon that caused
the trouble are the property of Smith &
Young. 723 Market street. The horse be
came frightened at the corner of Eighth
and Market streets and got beyond the
control of the two boys who were driving.
In front of the Sterling Furniture Com
pany's store the two boys jumped from
the wagon,' leaving 1 the horse to continue
his wild run. Near the corner of Taylor
street it knocked down the woman and
baby carriage. People who witnessed the
accident say that the escape of the wo
man and child was most miraculous. The
runaway was finally brought to a sudden
end\by a collision with one of the stone
corner posts of the Native Sons' Monu
ment at the corner of Mason street. The
post was broken off even with the ground.

Goldenson Blamed for Harris' Death.
A Coroner's jury returned a verdict yes
terday blaming J. . Galdenson for the
death of William A. Harris, . who was
killed last Wednesday by. being crushed
against the shed of the Twin Peaks brick
works as he was driving out with a load
of brick. The testimony was to the effect
that Harris, who was a green driver, was
Instructed by the foreman to follow hs
brother, A. J. Harris, who had gone just
ahead with a load, and that Goldenson
countermanded the order and instructed
Harris to drive by an "impassable route,"
oi\ which he met his death.

OALIFORNIA AND CHRISTMAS.
FROM the people of California there will be
sent this year to friends in the East or in
Europe a great multitude of Christmas* re- .
membrances. These will be scattered far and wide
and will be everywhere valued and treasured. In the
aggregate their cost will represent a "large sum of
money, so that the trade, both in its scope and in its
worth, is a matter of considerable importance.
If the majority of the Christmas presents sent
from California to other lands were made up of Cali
fornia products there would be a double benefit to
the community. In the first place the demand would
give a good market for the home industries that pro
duce the articles; and, in the second place, the dis
tribution of them through so wide an area of country
would materially assist in developing a foreign mar
ket for them. It is true that no individual is going to
send many such presents, and each therefore may
think it will not matter whether he send California
articles or Â»ot, but the subject should be considered
in the mass and not with respect to the actions of a
single person. The trade is large, the chance of
making known the merit of hundreds of articles of
California production is excellent, and by mutual
agreement all citizens should do their share in mak
ing the most of it
It is well known that the Christmas trade is one
of the largest of the year. So much money is ex
pended In holiday novelties that a period of well
nigh universal economy follows as soon as the holi
days are over. Trade in nearly all lines becomes
dull, and it is some 1 time before business resumes its
normal, activity, From that fact we may derive some
conception of the vast amount of money expended in
the Christmas trade, and most of that goes for the
purchase of presents of one kind or another. Cali
fornia imports an immense line of Christmas goods
from the East and from Europe, while her exports
of such goods are much less. than they ought to be.
A fair patronage of our home industries in that re
spect, therefore, is a matter of good business as well
as of local patriotism.
While we have no notable industry engaged
strictly in supplying goods for the Christmas trade,
we have none the less quite a variety of products ap
propriate for Christmas presents, ranging all the way
from photographs of California scenery to costly
articles manufactured from gold. In the scope of
that variety there is something to suit every taste.
A search of the stores would bring to light "a num
ber of beautiful products of California of which most
people have hardly heard. It would be well indeed
for some of .our enterprising merchants to make a
special display of California goods suitable for pres
ents and thus aid in promoting the patronage of the
home goods. Such a display would be widely talked
about and thus would serve as a good advertisement
for the merchant, so that he would gain by it as
much as would the manufacturer of the goods.
The subject is worth the attention of every one
who takes any interest in the development of the
State. The choice of California products for pres
ents to people in the East Â«will entail no increase of
cost, and the articles will be much more of a novelty
there than would be any Eastern or European
product Let every one therefore in proportion to
his means help to make this a good Christmas for
California industries by booming the market for

A New York woman is suing the operators of that
curious device known as "loop-the-loop" for damages
on the score that her daughter went insane after
riding in the machine. It was generally considered
that insanity was a preliminary qualification for most

AN ACCIDENT LESSON.
THE greatest railway accident since the" falling
of the â¢ Ashtabula bridge was that x on the
Wabash road in Michigan. â¢
. As the passenger traffic on American railways
amounts every year to the hauling of fifteen billions
of people one mile, it will be seen that whatever re
duces to a minimum the chance for accidents is of
as much importance to pur people as the prevention
of a fatal epidemic.
The investigation of this casualty makes it appear
that the engineer was confused in reading his orders
and confounded the station names of Seneca and
Sand Creek. The sibilant sound of each and the
haste in examining an order not too plainly written
on tissue paper caused the disaster, for the engineer
ran for a meet. at Sand Creek instead of lying at
Seneca for the opposite train tp pass.
This danger has been for some time recognized
by railroad men. In California we have so many sta
tions with Spanish names beginning with "San"
that the practice i's to "use in railroading only the
last name, omitting the prefix "San." Thus San
Leandro and. San Lorenzo become Leandro and
Lorenzo, in which form they are more easily dis
tinguished. ' "
A railroad does not always have the opportunity
to name its own stations, as it runs to. towns already
established. But these, as a rule, avoid similarity
of names for the 'purpose of individuality and to pre
vent confusion in' the mails. But where stations are
close together the prefixes La, San, Lake, Mount,
Las, Le, Lone, Los, New and others supply the
cause of accident by misreading and confusion. The
use of the points of the compass as prefixes comes in
the same category. When railroads are free to name
new stations which they create for the purpose of
traffic they should be careful to make selections that
are incapable of confusion with others.
It is even advisable to avoid beginning the names
of contiguous stations with the same letter of the
alphabet, since too often the engineer in his haste
catches the first letter'and takes the rest for granted.
The physical equipment of American road? has
long occupied the attention of railway" operators.
Improvement in grades and curves, and such stout
construction of passenger-cars as to enable them to
withstand the impact of a collision at high speed, have
progressed toward perfection. But they have paid
less attention to what may be called the psychology
of operation, that action ofithe mind applied to the
responsibility of train crews who have in charge the
safety of person and pioperty.
Nothing is more common than what is called
"absence of mind," that passing aphasia which
makes a * man forget an appointment, or to
mail a letter, or an errand, the name of a friend,
and sometimes even his own. To this every man 13
subject, no matter what his training or his occupa
tion. In the majority of instances in which it
occurs the results are not serious, and the lapse of
memory or its displacement from the object intended
to one not intended is treated as a joke.
In justice to railway crews let it be remembered
that they are no exception to the rule, which affects
all men alike. But in their case the -consequences
are apt to be immediate and awful, and there is too
great a tendency to treat them as if they were the!
only men subject to this infirmity.
They are entitled to every aid that can be brought
to the support of their wits and their memory, and
the entirely dissimilar naming of contiguous stations
is such an aid and is of first importance.
r A Cincinnati court has placed the value upon a
worthless husband, more eloquently described as
"indolent, loving, lying, gentle, deceitful, persuasive
and soft." In granting the wife a divorce the court
ordered her to pay her ex-husband a dollar a year for
every year of his life. The only sarcasm in the af
fair exists in the fact that the fellow is young.
FLOURISHING TERRITORIES.
ADVOCATES cf the early admission of Ari
zona, New Mexico- and Oklahoma to state
hood will find ample support for their cause
in the report made by the Secretary of the Interior
upon the conditions of those Territories and the
bright prospects before them of an increase in popu
lation and in wealth. He concedes to each of them a
larger population in 1900 than was shown by the cen
sus returns, and in other ways strengthens their posi
tion before the country.
Of Arizona he says the population is estimated at
fully 135,000, and points out that a number of locali
ties in the Territory complain of injustice done by
the census takers. Thus Phoenix was given a popula
tion of only 5544, but at the city election in May,
1901, the registration of voters showed 2317 names,
indicating a population of at least 10,000. As an.ex
planation of the discrepancy it is said the census was
taken in midsummer, when a large proportion of the
people of Phoenix were at the seaside and other sum
mer resorts. There arc 23,503 children of school age
in the Territory; the assessed valuation of property
I as finally fixed by the Board of Equalization is
I $38,853,831. The real wealth of the people, however,
is much larger than that, as much personal property
and mining property escapes taxation. It is added:
"The quality of Arizona citizenship is said to be of
the highest- character; the â  population t is typically
I American, and the percentage of illiteracy is thought
i to be smaller than in any State in the Union."
Of New Mexico the report says: "The estimated
total population at present is 300,000, exclusive of In
dians, which latter number 12,206. The Governor
takes strong grounds against the injustice^ as he de
clares, which the recent census does in accrediting
the Territory with a population of but 195,310 in 1900.
He asserts that the registration in October, 1900.
which showed 59,297 voters in the Territory, should
serve as a fair basis for arriving at a just-estimate of
the population. Few of the large number of voters
are without families, and even among the miners in
the Territories more than half have families. Reckon
ing, therefore, five persons to the family of each
voter, would make the total estimate of population
205,485." :â¢ V"Â®>-
The taxable value, of property in New Mexico is
$150,000,000, and the opinion is expressed that. this
sum would be more than trebled within five years
after the admission of the Territory as a State.- The
number of children of school age in the Territory is
53,008, and of those 47.7OO are enrolled as pupils in the
schools. Illiteracy has steadily decreased since the
annexation of the Territory to the Unked States, and
at the present time does not exceed 20 per cent.
Oklahoma, though the, youngest of the Territories,
is the brightest -star s of them all. It was accredited
by the census of 1900 with a population of 398,331,
but. the present estimate gives a population in excess
of 500,000. The taxable value of property for 1901 is
$60,464,696. The enumeration of school children for
the year was 1 14,737- Of the population generally it is
said: "The people of the Territory are distinctively
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1901.
American, less than 5 per cent being of foreign birth,
and the percentage of illiteracy is less than in three
fourths of the States. 'Social life in the Territory
has generally the same "aspects as in the States, with
out there_ being any class distinctions. The com
munity is a thoroughly democratic one, where all
have equal opportunities for advancement and pre
ferment." . ,
It will be perceived that these statements constitute
strong and valid arguments for conferring statehood
upon the three Territories. .Each of them is now
more populous than several of the" States, and each/
has ample resources and area for further growth in
population and in industry. They are occupied' by
people who are quite capable of self-government, and
accordingly there seems to be no reason why their
desire for statehood should not be granted.
ALL stories concerning Henry Watterson's
Presidential aspirations are false. Mr. Wat
terson has no desire to be President. That
much is made evident by his speech at the banquet
of the Massachusetts Association. He stated ex
pressly that he would not be a candidate for the
Presidency unless he were assured beforehand of re
ceiving the electoral vote of Massachusetts. That
settles it.
Having thus put aside ambition, Mr. Watterson in
the remainder of his speech disported , himself with
the recklessness of a free lance. He' admitted that in
some things Massachusetts is better than Kentucky,*
but attributed thejsuperiority to the fact that Massa
chusetts is quite an. old settlement, while Kentucky
"is young yet." Passing to a consideration of the
tariff he declared that the time is not far off when
Pennsylvania will be for free trade and Kentucky
will be insisting upon the continuance of protection.
Then "he broke forth: "What a comedy, the thing
We call government; and what a humbug, the thing
we call politics! And yet, after all, how inevitable.
I believe we shall never approach the ideal in gov
ernment until we have forced public men to speak
the truth." -, fL
From that point the orator proceeded â¢ to discuss
truth and how to restore it to the service of'politi
cians, or rather how to bring politicians to a worship
of truth. He believes the change is going to be ac
complished by filling the people so full of lies they
will become sated and refuse to swallow any "more.
He says: "The press-r-particularly the yellow press
âis doing a noble work to the correction of this
evil, because already people are beginning to believe
nothing they read in newspapers, and after a while,
tiring of the endless daily' surfeit of misinformation,
they will begin to demand a journalism less interest
ing and more trustworthy; and, believe me, when
ever they make this requisitionâ whenever they dis
criminate between the organ of fact and the organ of
fancyâ there will not be lacking editors who prefer
to grow rich telling the truth than to die poor tell
ing: lies."
Mr. Watterson, it will be seen, is an optimist. He
believes we are living "in untoward times," but he
thinks the excess of evil will work its own cure. He
says we are in danger of Mammon, and that there
is a growing use _of money in elections. By way of
getting rid of that evil he suggested to Senator
â Hanna, who was present at the banquet, that the
national committees of the' two parties should ar
range to give their joint note for whatever 'sum they
deemed advisable to expend during a campaign; that
the sum thus obtained be equally divided, and that
after the election the winners should pay the whole
note.,
Leaving that proposition to be considered by the
intelligence and morality of the country, the gifted
Kentuckian pursued his oratorical flight to other
themes and cheered his listening Bostonians by as
suring them that no matter what may happen to in
dividuals here and there who fall a victim to the
temptations of Mammon, the people themselves will
never be corrupted. He declares we are going to
redeem the nations and the races ofithe earth not
only politically but morally. "We are," he said, "to
revitalize the primitive religion, with its often mis-,
leading theologies, into a new and practical system
of life and thought, of universal religion, to which
the Declaration of Independence, the constitution of
the United States and the Sermon on the Mount
shall furnish the inspiration and the keynote, to the
end that all the lands and all the tribes shall teem
with the love of man and the glory of the Lord."
Such is Mr. Watterson's platform. It sounds like
a bid for the vote of Massachusetts, but really it is
a farewell to. the Presidential bee.' Mr.' Watterson
will retire.
New,- Yorkers who have" known Roosevelt as a free
and frequent orator are noting with surprise that
since his elevation to the Presidency he has made but
one speech, and that was no more than a short ad
dress at the Yale bicentennial. It is evident; that
Roosevelt understands- the responsibilities of his.po
sition, and knows that where he is now it is danger
ous to talk too much.
Ananias seems to have chosen Cleveland, Ohio, as
the locality for a modern residence. He has assumed
the character of a newspaper correspondent who says
that two burglars, surprised by a child in a house a
few nights ago; listened to her pleading, begged her
to pray for them, returned what they had stolen and
now- resolve to lead honest lives.
President Roosevelt is being censured by some
supersensitivc persons for giving football. the indorse
ment of his presence. These critics are convinced
that the game is brutal and the President erred in
sanctioning it. It would be intefesting.to know what
these carpers think of .the. president's astounding
conduct at San Juan Hill. . . .â¢'.â¢ .
A Philadelphia anarchist who is serving a 'term in
prison for murder has asked -'for a/writ of habeas
corpus on the ground that he is tired of his surround
ings. This shows us the futility of depriving anarch
ists of that reward of their trade â a rope.
There is one hope for the internal revenue tax; the
brewers and the distillers have found' it impossible to
work together, and as the chances are that each 'will
keep the work of the other from effecting anything,
the tax will hold its own.
A Paterson woman said the*, other day that she
wanted to' join the angels. She took a dose of hair
tonic, but her journey will have to be postponed until
she finds some agency more buoyant.

WATTERSON'S IDEAS.
MISS JULIET WILLIAMS GIVES
HER HEART TO ALEXANDER LILY
SOCIETY will be thrown into a nutter
over the announcement of the en
gagement of Miss Juliet Williams
and Alexander Lily.
Members of. San Francisco's smart set
saw nothing of Miss Williams for three
years until .the last season, and no time
has been lost in taking her back to their
hearts, for she was ever a favorite, and
now to think of losing her again will come
in the nature of a shock to them. â¢
Mr. Lily, the groom-to-be, is a native of
Columbus, Ohio, and comes from one of
the \jny best families there. \ His father,
M. C. Lily, was during his life time at the
head of the M. C. Lily Company; for many
years large furnishers of Government sup
plies.
Mr. Lily reached San Francisco : only
three days ago and registered at the Pal
ace. He has arranged to remain in this
city for some time, having been appointed
agent for a. number of Eastern compa
nies.' He is a graduate of Princeton and
said to be a very clever man.
The acquaintance began in New York.
Then Miss Williams traveled abroad ex
tensively and it was not until she returned
to San Francisco that Mr. Lily visited her
here and obtained her promise. . â 
It was Intended to keep the betrothal a
profound secret until after Cfirlstmas,
when Miss Williams would have invited
her most intimate friends to luncheon
and confided to them "first; but the news
leaked out before a formal announcement
could be made. There are ;no wedding
arrangements yet, as the affair will not
take place for several â¢ months to come,
but spring will claim Miss Williams for a
bride, '
It will be remembered that Miss Wil
liams made her social debut several sea
sons ago with her sister, now Mrs. Walter
S. Hobart. Her personality is more than
pleasing. She is a splendidly bred girl
with a charming face and manner. Such
a favorite, cannot well be spared from San
Francisco and her friends will do their
best to persuade the young couple to
make this city their permanent home.
â¢ Since her return to the coast Miss Wil
liams has divided her time between tho
pld home in San Rafael with her grand
mother, Mrs. Robert Neale, and the town
house of her cousin, Mrs. Albert J. Dib
blee, at 2717 Pacific avenue, this city. .
Dr. and Mrs. James A. Black gave an
informal dinner in honor of Miss Edith
Huntington last evening at the Pendletoi:.
Covers were laid for fifteen and the deco
rations were red. It was a delightful af
fair. The debutantes of this season were
the only ones of the fair sex Invited and
army officers constituted the masculine
portion of the company.
Miss Huntington will soon be a debu
tante herself, as she intends to make her
formal bow to society January 24 next. In
a few days she leaves for New York,
where she will select her "coming out"
gowns. Miss Huntington is a niece of the
late Collis P. Huntington. She will be a
very popular bud.
The -guests were: Miss Ardella Mills,
Miss Pearl Landers, Miss Catherine "Rob
inson and the Misses McClung, and* Dr.
C. Clark Collins and Dr. McVean, U. S.
A.; Lieutenant Lowenberg, Lieutenant
Brpwer, Lieutenant Babcock, Captain
Kirkpatrick. and Lieutenant Day.
The California Keramic Club closed its
annual exhibition last evening at the
Palace Hotel. Mrs. Hatch carried off- the
honors of the exhibition with her hand
some works of art. Miss Smith also ex
hibited a number of handsome art pieces
which were highly complimented. The
exhibition was the most successful' that
the club has ever given.
William Northrop Cowles and Miss
Marie Zane, two well known members of
the, exclusive set of this city, were united
in marriage in New York yesterday. The
news of the wedding was telegraphed last
night to the Loughboroughs, who are rel
atives of the beautiful bride. ,
Archbishop Corrigan ofliciated at the
ceremony, which was performed at the
residence of the bride's aunt, Mrs. Dr.
Keys,' on Fifth avenue.
Miss Zane is an attractive and accom
plished young lady. she was here
three years ago she was made much of by
the smart set. She comes of one of the
oldest and most esteemed families of
Ohio. The city of Zanesville in that State
takes its name after her father. For the
last few years she has been traveling in
Europe. Her brother graduated from
West Point this year.
. Mr. Cowles is well known in this city.
He Is a member of the leading clubs and
has been associated with the Crockers in
many important business deals. .

others assert she is at the bottom of the
sea. Tales brought to port of other ves
sels seem to bear out the contentions of
the latter and 80 per cent would not bring
forth, a bid on the steamship to-day.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
ship Lucile, from Oyster Harbor, and the.
Leyland Brothers,: from Astoria, The
former was on her way to the Hawaiian
Islands and the latter to England. The
Lucile carries a cargo of coal, while the
Leyland Brothers carries wheat. Both
vessels canoe in here in distress.
Captain Bailey of the Leyland Brothers
said:
We left the Colombia River on November
30. We did not have a very good crew as
nearly all the men were French and could not
epeak English. On December 3 when In lati
tude 46 degrees north, lonerlture 120 degrees
west, we were struck by a hurricane. The
ship was thrown on her beam ends and the
lee -all waÂ» under water. For twelve hour*
I was not sure of anything and every order I
gave my men miscarried. The Frenchmen
could net speak a word of English, and, of
course, neither I nor my officers can speak
French. At times it seemed as though we
would go down, but, more by luck than good
management, the ehip righted herself and we
were once more in fairly good shape. The
cargo had shifted to starboard, the lower and
man fore topsail yards had carried away, some
damage was done to the deck, and one or two
of the crew had been slightly damaged, but
not to amount to anything, but nevertheless
I decided* to put In here for repairs. I think
we will set away in a day or two.
Captain Bailey did not say so, but the
fact is nevertheless true that the Colum
bia River is in the hands of the crimps
and a vessel in order to get a crew must
take what is offering. Thus the Leyland
Brothers was towed down from Portland
to Astoria and at the latter place her men
were put aboard. A boarding master
went to sea with them and came ashore
on the tugboat. Before leaving he drew
down his "blood money," and then the
captain had a chance to muster his crew.
In the case of the Leyland Brothers nine
tenths of the men could not speak Eng
lish and with English officers it can be
imagined what followed when a hurricane
struck the ship.
The Leyland Brothers was not an hour
in r>ort before all hands forward had de
serted her. When a Call reporter and an
artist went aboard there wasn't a soul left
save the first and the second mates and
the cook. All the others werÂ« having a
grood time on the front about th*t time.
The Leyland Brothers carries 75.779 cen
tals of wheat, valued at $72,000, shipped by
the Portland Flour Mills. She was bound
for Cork for orders.
WAS ALSO IN THE HUBBICAUE.
Ship Lucile Puts in Â«Here for an
Overhauling.
The Lucile came Into port late " last
night like a -wounded duck. Her fore top

gone and the damage about the deck was
considerable. She left Oyster Harbor for
Kehei, H. I., more than a week ago and
was caurht in the hurricane off the Co
lumbia River. Luckily all hands could
work together and even though the masts*
came tumbling down, the cargo shifted
and the seams opened and all hands had
to go to the> pumps, still there was no con
fusion and the ship rode out the gale.
Yesterday afternoon she was taken In tow
by the tug Sea Queen and brought' into
port. The chances are that her coal cargo
will be discharged Into another vessel and
the Lucile will go on the drydock >for an
overhauling. . . -. _

aiail ed vices from New York say:
"The spot market for domestic loose and
reeded raisins Is In very strong position, all
low-priced goods having been cleaned up by
local jobbers and seeders in consequence of the
l-eported practical cornering of the market for
loose in California by the "High Five," or
redding combine. The latter have withdrawn
*tl prices on loose and seeded except on 4Â«i
crown loose and it is currently reported in ad
vices from the coast that the combine will offer
no more loose 2-crown and 3-crown to the
trade, but will seed their entire holdings of

ed product %c to %c above the former quota

larpe outside packer has named quotations for

the trade is not at present disposed to buy at
these figures and no effort is being made to
j-ush business on that basis.
"On spot seeded are held from 7S7 %c for
choice and from 7%@7%e for fancy. One lot
of the latter description is reported still avail
able at 7%c. Spot supplies of loose are not
l^lieved to b* large and the market Is very
firm at 5%Â©5%c, with some holders asking
es high as 5%c. Since the first news of recent
developments en the coast reached the East,
well-informed dealers and seeders have bought
up all the loose 2-crown and 3-crown Musca
tels in this and other Eastern markets. A num
ber of cars vrere purchased by New York houses
in Boston, where the market was lower than
here. There was comparatively light buying
on the tpot yesterday at the higher range.
"Valencia layer raisins are rapidly becom
ing scarcer under a good steady demand, both
â  from local and nearby trade and also from
Canadian cities, and the market is very firm
at 7<57%c. Sultanas tell only moderately well.
Poaches and apricots are going on well for the
season of the year and there Is a firmer feeling
in the former article.
"Santa Clana prunes, new crop, are firmer

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 12.â Speculative liquida
tion continued in the stock market to-day, in
duced by the stringency in money, which ran
the < s II loan rate up to 12 per cent at one
time and forced a good ehare of liquidation.
Other selling was precautionary, in â¢ fear of
rtill more ttringent conditions in the. money
market. A very material element In the day's
weakness was the short selling by the bears,
, who became emboldened by the lack of ' sup
l-ort tn the market and â  put out very large
short lines. When the market turned tne
ljeare found they had been following the de
cline too closely and they helped on the rally
by biddira; against each other to get back
stocks. The rally came when the banks came
into the exchange market for the Arst time
late in the day and offered large sums at the
lirevailing rstc. which wae at the high level.
With the satisfaction of the demand by these
oScrinss the rate fell away and , the pressure
on the stock market was quickly relaxed.
Dealings by the bears was the one element
In the rally. This was not fully held and the
market closed Irregular. Losses are shown
practically throughout. There is nothing ob
scure about the situation of the money mar
ket. With surplus reserves shown to be below
$ 7. 000. 000 in last Saturday's bank statement
and with laree seasonable credit allowances
known to be pending it was obvious that the
money supply would be limited. The outgo of
gold is continuing, in spite of the . need for
money, to-day showing a withdrawal of $500,.
000 from the sub-treasury for shipment on
Saturday, said to be for Brazil. The renewed
demand for the interior is also an unexpected
development and was continued to-day with
the transfer of $100,000 to New Orleans. The
redemptions of Government bonds are not suf
ficient to offset the requirements of the sub
treasury as is shown by yesterday's net Bain
by that institution of $439,000. in spite of pay
ment in redemption of bonds of upward of
$1,500,000. Besides the general influence of
the money situation there was some special
weakness shown by New York Central at a
decline of 3% on the restriction of action by
the directors of Vanderbilt roads at to-day's
meeting to an advance In the dividend rate
on Canada Southern. Northwest dropped 4
and Omaha 0. Pennsylvania and Norfolk and
Western fell over 2 points. A decline of 2\b
in Manhattan led the weakness in the local
tractions. Among the industrials Colorado
Fuel fell 6% on rumors of dissensions In the
corporation. General Electric lost 8. American
Linseed preferred 5 and Tennessee Coal 2%.
without special explanation. The general
range of declines ran from 1 to 2 points.
Louisville at one time falling 2%. The ex
treme losses were much modified by the final
rally. Amalgamated Copper fluctuated from a
high level of 71% in the mornlngr down to
07 in the afternoon, closing at 6S%, a net
loss of 2'i- ?
Bonds were active and weak. Total sales,
par value, $3,545,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram cays:
Disturbing elements in the stock market to
day were a fresh drop in copper to Â£52 5s the
ton and in Rio Tintos to 41%, and the- con
tinued flatness of American stocks which failed
to hold the opening prices, nervous bulls clos
ing their contracts. New York came again
as a seller, but a rally toward the close on
Amalgamated Copper dividend talR was only
momentary, as London thinks the company
squeezed resources to support the market. The
close was at the bottom on private cable dis
patches announcing dear money in New York.
The Bank of England is still lending. Money
is expected to be tight, but the bank returns
show that reserve is Â£4,000.000 higher than
a year ago at the same time, and, therefore,
nothing serious Is anticipated.
Gold to the amount of Â£20,000 has gone to
the Continent and the price of the metal has
risen to 77s lOd on the Continental demand.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. 12. â Weakness was felt In
all Brains to-day. Wheat had a quiet and
heavy market. A severe storm off the English
coast prevented the arrival of Liverpool cables,
but the weak tone in the London market was
thought to reflect the tone at other big marts.
Business at the opening was fair and prices
remarkably steady. Northwestern receipts
were rather light, but later the primary re
ceipts showed heavy Increases and had a de
pressing effect. Selling was the main influ
ence, however. There was Dractlcallv no
country buying present and there was a heavy
liquidation at prices over 80c for May/ May
opened %@%c higher to %@%c lower at 80%c
to 80c, and en the absence of support at those
figures sold down quickly to 79%c. Fr.om this
point it was a narrow scalplnar market. The
close was weak, %@%c down, at 79 %c.
Corn sold oft heavily the first hour, follow
ing wheat. Late in the session several trad
ers began taking on long line, and frightened
shorts covering-, sent prices back slightly. May
closed weak, %c down, at 66% c.
- Oats followed corn. May closed %c down
at 45c.
Hog products were given poor support, both
locally and outside. January pork closed 15:
down, lard 2%c off and ribs 7%c lower.

New York Metal Market.
NEwVoRK, Dec. 12.â The feature in the
metal markets to-day was the heavy selling of

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â There is a distinct slackening of
the buying demand all over the world. Paris
futures are lower and tho Liverpool market is
quoted easier and neglected. The Englishmen
from the very first refused to respond to the
American advance.
Chicago declined from 80%c to 79%c, recov
ering to 79 %c. The opening was fairly active,
and there were good buying orders around 80c,
but heavy liquidation weakened the market
and big stop orders at 79c came in. aggra
vating the weakness. The country, which for
some days formed the chief purchasers and
were the prime cause of the rise, turned right
about, apd fearing that they had killed the
goose that laid the golden egg, began to sell
freely. The rally at the close was caused by
the shorts covering. There was talk of a de
crease In the Northwestern movement, but the
Southwest sold freely. It had up to yesterday
been a liberal buyer. Minneapolis and Duluth
estimated an Increase of 2,500,000 in their
stocks for the week. . â¢
This market declined again, both on and off

Tacoma and is reported to be after 2500 tons
more at the latter point; it is also taking 2500
tons at Portland. In addition 2000 tons have
lately been bought In Eastern Oregon for ship
ment into the Western States. This makes a
movement, past, present and prospective ' of

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Potatoes are quoted rather firm than ' oth

stocks at Stockton. Prices show little change.
Receipts of Onions are light at the mo
ment, but the presence of more or less unsold
stock keeps the market weak.

Poultry and Game.
Another car of Eastern Poultry falls due
to-day.
Dressed Turkeys are in ample supply and
weaker. Other Poultry is weak except young
stock, which is selling fairly. The demand

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
All quotations under this head remain about
the same. Butter continues weak for all de
scriptions except strictly fancy creamery,
which is steady. Packed goods are particularly
weak and slow, with large supplies yet to
draw on. Cheese is also in good supply and
easy. The cold weather is imparting rather
more steadiness to Eggs, but the tendency is
to sell Just the same, as the production Is
likely to increase at this time of the year.
Receipts were 22,600 pounds of Butter, ~ â â

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Berries from Watsonville continue to arrive
late and are carried over from day to day.
Apples from the same shipping point are run
ning poor and wormy.
Receipts of Oranges are not as heavy as they
have been, as shippers seem to be holding back
for the forthcoming auction. The movement
is nothing extra. The Sound is stocked with

ON THE STAND
Says That Max Kershow
Introduced Her as
His Wife.
Proponent of Disputed Will
Tells of Her Life With
Student.
Rhea Gcttings. a pretty blonde wearing
a sealskin coat, a fur-trimmed hat. a
brown golf skirt and the latest make of
shoes, occupied the attention" of the law
yers in Department S of the Superior
court yesterday. She is the proponent of
the Ivershow will and was called to give
testimony In her own behalf. By the
terms of the disputed will she Is to receive
all of the Yale man's estate after legacies
amounting to about J'JOOO are paid: To
nave the will probated means a fortune of
about tiO.OOO for Rhea, and the testimony
*' le Â£ ave >' es terday supported her claim
io the estate.
She said she met Kershow at 223 Ellis
street in May. 181)9. and that six weeks
after their meeting she went to live with
n:m at the Maison Riche. Continuing,
tlie said:
Max and I went to Honolulu In December,
isnÂ». I traveled as bis wife, and while we
were in Honolulu he introduced me as such.
\\> came back to San Francisco in January,
1OIX.I, and went to reside at the Riche. He in
troduced me here as Mrs. Kershow and I re
mained with him at the ttiche until March.
31)00. He drank a ereat deal, but after in
â¢HUgrtng^ in drink for several days he would
Quit and May sober fcr three or four weeks.
I went to Chicago in April or May. I was
absent come time. He wrote to me and in
hie letters he called me "near Babe." When
I returned to this city he was still at the Riche
and he remained there until November of last
year. I visited him several times after my
return, in fact I was Mith him there up to
the time he left the restaurant.
In November I went to Portland, where I
remained for three weeks. When I got back
he was at Tortoni's.
The court was adjourned at this point
of Miss Gettings' story until Monday at
11 a. m.
During the morning session "W. L. Craj'
ton. a bartender at Geta's saloon, testi
fied that in his opinion Kershow was of
sound mind.
Ralph Freldlander, who loaned money
and sold jewelry to Kershow, said the
Yale athlete was in the possession of his
senses during all the time he had deal
ings with him, which continued up to the
time of his death. . â
"Ten days before he died," said Freid
lander. "I was in his rooms. His brother.
Carieton, was there, and Max told "him
that I held two notes of his, one for $50
and another of $100, and that he aiso
owed me $4 for a pin. He asked his
brother to see that I was paid."
INGHAJS: PLAYS DETECTIVE
TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
He Is Scored by Judge Mogan for
Arresting a Young Man
for Burglary.
A peculiar case of burglary, reflecting
upon the conduct of a policeman, was
heard by Judge Slogan yesterday. The de
fendant was Andrew Maas, who Is in
partnership with his father in a saloon at
Howard and Beale streets. He was ac
cused of breaking into the saloon of Her
man Dierks, 201 Steuart street, on the
morning of December 9, and stealing 40
cents from the till.
The arresting officer was Policeman
Ingham. and he testified that he found
a watch in Dierks' saloon, which had evi
dently been left behind by the burglar. It
bore the initials "A. M.." and that led
him to the conclusion that it belonged to
the defendant and he placed Maas under
arrest after he had acknowledged that
lite watch/ belonged to him; -.Â»â â¢-
The defendant testified that he had been
held' up at California and Drumm streets
on the night of December S and robbed of
hi? watch and money. He called for help
and a saloon-keeper on the corner blew
a polioe whistle. The policeman who- an
swered the call found the crystal and ring
of the watch on the corner. Maas went
home and told his father of the robbery.
Several witnesses were called and gave
the defendant an excellent. character.
The Judge dismissed the case and said
if there were such a thing as honorable
acquittal it would apply to the defendant,
as his arrest was an outrage. The foot
pad had evidently been the burglar and
and left the watch in Dierks' saloon,
probably by accident.
MOLE'S MURDERER WILL
LIKELY GO UNPUNISHED
The Charge Against John M. Dolau
Is Dismissed by Judge
Conlan.
Judge Conlan yesterday granted the
motion of Attorney Schlesinger to dismiss
the case of John M. Dolan, charged with
the murder of ( Albert A. Mole in front of
239 O'Farrell street, on the morning of
November 22.
The Judge said a number of witnesses
had been examined, but their evidence in
no way connected the defendant with the
crime. Only one witness. Chapman,
whose statement was very hazy, said he
had seen Doian running across the street
as Mole fell. No weapon was found. It
had been the most astonishing case ever
brought before him. the Judge said. A
murder had most certainly been commit
ted, but there was no direct testimony to
connect Dolan with it.
Assistant District Attorney Weller said
hp had consulted the District Attorney
and they were of the same opinion as the
Judge. Chapman, the murdered man's
particular friend, had only been ten feet
distant when the crime was committed,
and yet he Faw nothing of it. The de
fendant could get out a writ of habeas
corpus and be released at once on the evi
dence adduced, the court said.
"I have my personal and private opin
ion," said the Judge, "but that is not evi
dence. The case will be dismissed."
Dolan is not yet "out of the woods," as
the matter can be taken before the Grand
Jury.
HOLD UP MINER FROM
BRITISH COLUMBIA
William Grissett and Percy Schreiner
Under Arrest on a Charge
of Robbery.
John Badnastz. a miner from British
Columbia, was held up on Howard street,
between Third and Fourth, about half
past 3 o'clock yesterday morning. Police
man P. J. Mitchell heard hia cries for
help and on reaching the scene found
Badnastz holding on to a man who, he
said had held him up and robbed him cf
J2. The man gave his name as- William
Grfcreett. Percy Schreiner, a bartender,
was standing beside them, and Badnastz
accused him of being an accessory.
Grissett and Schreiner were taken to
the City Prison and booked on a charge
of robbery. When Grissett was searched
$2 45 was found In his pockets. The case*
wore called in Judge Cabaniss court yes
terday and after hearing the evidence of
Jiadnkstz and the arresting officer the
case wa* continued till to-day, the Judge
remarking that he would probably hold
Grissett and discharge Schreiner.

LEAVES BABY
ON DOORSTEP
Mother Thinks Father
Should Care for
Child.
Robert Brown Declines to
v Support His Reputed
Offspring.
When Thomas Rehn of 3 Elizabeth
street opened his front door yesterday
morning at 6 o'clock he was surprised to
find a bundle on the front doorstep. An
examination of the bundle revealed a tiny
bit of humanity wrapped in woolen cloth-
Ing and a note explaining the circum
stance under which the baby was left
there. Helm at once communicated his
find to Police Sergeant Duke of the Seven
teenth street station. The note is as fol
lows:
_ . - December U. 1901.
Robert Brown: I think I have done my
share of the Buffering:, so I think it is your
time. You may do as you wish with the poor
little one for it is not to blame, but I hope
you will give it good care. He was born No
vember 29, 1901, so he is just thirteen days
old to-day. * I hate to have such a thing done,
but circumstances alter cases and as you are
his father I don't think It more than right that
you should provide for him. His name is Rob
ert, too, named after you.
Now. Robbie, things will have to be kept
very quiet, for my brother has Ween- here in
the city looking for me since I have been away
and lie will make it pretty warm for us if he

In leaving the child at Rehn's door the
mother made a mistake, as Brown, the
reputed father, lives at 7 Elizabeth street.
two doors from where the child was left.
Brown, who is nineteen years of age, is
engaged as a packer in a downtown
house. i
On his being informed of the -circum
stances attending the child he declined
to be responsible for its support and as
a. consequence the little infant was sent
to . the General Emergency Hospital,
where the matron. Miss Hart, made the
little one as comfortable as possible. In
the meantime Sergeant Duke made an In
vestigation and found that the mother's
name is Maria Baker, a young woman
who had been a domestic in the service
Â°h Mrs - AnnIe T - Teague, a widow re
siding at 316 Bartlett street. Miss Baker
left the Teague household in the early
part of Ivovember. The police have no"t
yet succeeded in locating the mother.

RECOMMENDS REMOVAL
OF THE BARGE OFFICE
Captain Healy Suggests Black Point
p.s an Ideal Location for the
New Site.
Captain M. A. Healy has written a let
ter to Customs Collector Stratton recom
mending that the barge office and head
quarters for the Federal quarantine serv
ice be changed to Black Point. Captain
Healy urges that the Government by tho
change will save a considerable rental, be
sides improving the efficiency of the serv
ice. He recommends also that offices for
customs boarding officers and the immi
grant inspectors be located in the same
place.
The proposed site, urges Captain Healy,
is much more convenient and safer for the,
barges in rough â - weather. Dr. Car
michael, the Federal quarantine officer,
indorses the proposition and has ad
dressed a letter to Washington recom
mending the adoption of Captain Healy's
suggestions.

THE, SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER J 3, 1901.
SUES A NEPHEW
FOR A PITTANCE
Peter P. Lane Wants "Re
mainder of His Once
Snug Estate.
Aged Sea Captain's Wealth
. Goes to Save Him
From Prison.
Captain Peter F. I.ane, who hojds a note
for $1000, executed by his nephew, J. B.
Warren, commenced suit in Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday to recover that
sum, with interest from April 22, 1896.
Lane is a retired sea captain. In 1895 he
was arrested on a grave charge. He was
tried and acquitted, and, according to
the story he told in court yesterday, it
cost him every cent he possessed.
Lane does not complain of the charge
of $9000 for legal services which, it is al-
Jeged, was made by his attorneys. Carroll
Cook, George Knight and H. C. Fire
baugh, but he strenuously objects to the
efforts he claims his nephew made -to
"get all he could out of him." lie accuses
Warren of having, at the time of the sen
sational trial, a desire to send him to
prison in order that his schemes to get all
his property might be furthered.
Lane said yesterday that Warren got in
all $10,260 from him to use In his (Lane's)
defense and that Warren withheld all
that remained of that sum after paying
the lawyers. Lane said also that after he
was acquitted he found that his home had
been stripped of everything, even to the
bed clothing.
"Among the articles missing," said
Lane, "were eighteen cases of Holland
gin worth $30 a oas<*. Warren told me he
had sold it for $12 50 a case. He gave me
a note for $1000 on account of what he
had received and promised tq take care
of me. He did for a while, but of late I
have suffered for the common necessaries
of life."
URGES CHANGE OF
\ GEADES IN POTRERO
Santa Fe Railway Company Expresses
. Desire to Improve a Number
of Streets.
Captain A. II. Payson, vice president of
the Santa Fe Company, appeared before
the Street Committee yesterday to urge
the adoption of the resolution authorising
the establishment of new grades in the
Potrero. Captain Payson said the pro
posed plans had been drawn with a de
sire to do the least possible damage to
surrounding property, and that- the
change of grades would be of material
benefit. ej
Joseph Glackin and M. Kenny, property
owners representing the Southern Heights
Improvement Club, said the work of cut
ting through the streets would destroy
property values in that vicinity, but H.
A. Whitley, secretary of the Real Estate
and Development Company, thought the
change-would be in the nature of an Im
provement. M. Lesky, another property
owner, agreed with Whitley.
The committee postponed action in order
to make a personal Inspection in the
afternoon.
Dr. Emma Merritt and W. H. Adamson,
executors cf the late Adolph Sutro's will,
appeared and signified a willingness to
grant an extension to the city to complete
the De.wey boulevard in accordance with
the modifications suggested by the City
Kngineer if the extension can be legally
granted, the deed to the* right of way be
ing held in escrow by 1. W. Helln~.au,
president of the Nevada Bank, pending
fulfillment of conditions contained there
in.' M. H. Garoutte, representing tho
Spring Valley Water Company, did not
know if the corporation would give its
consent. Chief Engineer -Schussler, 1 who
is familiar . with the facts, was too ill
to appear. The City Attorney will be
asked for his opinion as to the validity
of granting an extension.-
PASHION BESIEGES
THE BOHEMIAN CLUB
Many of the Pictures on View Wer.3
Sold Last Night to
Admirers.
Fashion and beauty took possession of
the Bohemian Club last night for several
hours and indulged comment and criti
cism upon the paintings which adorn the
walls of the jinks room. From 8 o'clock
until 11 there* was a stream of guests
crowding into the gallery and from Presi
dent Deering to Secretary Hayes all offi
cers and members of the club were kept
busy receiving and showing that particu
lar courtesy for which the Bohemians are
distinguished. One of the strong magnets
of the exhibition was Orrin Peck's very
striking portrait of President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, around which was a con
stant crush of admirers, and no less at
tractive seemed the "Big Trees" of T.
Hill, C. J. Dlckman's Turneresque paint
ing "After the Storm" and an odd study
by A. F. Mathews, with something of the
Whistler type of eccentricity. Latimer's
"Redwoods" and "Bursting Through the
Fog," with their atmospheric effects; C.
Chapel Judson's breezy effect, "Where
the Wind Blows," and Thomas Hill's bold
"Bridal Veil Fall" (Yosemite) and "Big
Trees in Mariposa Grove" drew many ad
mirers. Thf impressionist studies of J.
Frank McComas "were highly praised, and
a dainty little fancy, "Berkeley Hills," by
Harry W. Seawell, had delighted some
artistic eye to the extent that it bore on
Its frame the word "sold," as indeed did
several other really admirable canvases.
Among the appreciative visitors at the ex
hibition was Sir Edward C. Boehm. There
will be two more exhibitions to 'which
friends of the members of the club will be
Invited.

IN CUTTING AFFRAY
Joe Rosa Is Seriously Stabbed by a
Companion Named Frank
Monez.
Joe Rosa, a laborer, was stabbed and'
probably fatally injured about 8 o'clock
last night by a. companion, Frank Monez.
The cutting occurred on the northeast
Arner of Jackson and Drumm streets and
was the culmination of an altercation
which took place a few minutes before in
a neighboring saloon.
Blows were struck, whereupon Monez
who got the worst of the fistic encounter,
drew a knife and thrust lt Into Rosa's
body on the left side. One of the wounds
penetrated the pleura, and the nhyisclans
at the Harbor.Hospltal, where the injured
man was - taken, i say that it may prove
fatal. Monez was arrested shortly after !
the cutting by. Officers Dower and Burns I
and taken to the Harbor Station. Detec- !
tive Coleman was detailed on the case
He took Monez to the hospftal, where
Rosa identified him as his assailant i

The greater part of yesterday's session
of the United States Circuit Court in the

ter party of. that vessel, v The Frankfort

Cheyney's Alleged Wife
Pails to Recognize

Says Defendant Misled Her
Mother as to Their
Relations.
Maud Cheyney, who says she is the wife
of Samuel "W, Cheyney, a .wealthy young
mining man, would â  not swear yesterday
that any of the letters shown, to her in
Judge Sloss' court' were in her handwrit
ing, and would not swear either that they
were not. She did, however, swear that
a letter written by Cheyney to a Miss
Pounding, in which he refers to the plain
tiff as his "wiffle," was in his handwrit
ing. ; ;
Mrs. Cheyney is suing Cheyney for
maintenance. She claims she was mar
ried to Cheyney according to a. Quaker
marriage rite, and' that she lived with him
for a long time.
In giving her. testimony, yesterday she
was very positive in her refusals to iden
tify the letters she is supposed . to have
written.- They all . contain ..expressions
showing* the. love, and affection she had
for her "dear boy."-:
She surprised the court by saying that
many of the letters she wrote to Chey
ney were dictated by him and then , sent
by a colored maid to Ijos Gatos' to be
mailed. He received them in this city and
then took them to her mother, who did
not like him, and showed them to her for
the purpose of "proving" that the plain
tiff was not in his company. ..
. Mrs. Nevill, mother of Mrs. Cheyney.
never knew that the letters postmarked
Los Gatos were written in this city or
that her daughter was not in Los Gatos.
Such is Mrs. Cheyney's storj' and she
adheres to it. notwithstanding the close
questioning to which â¢,. she is subjected.
After taking a glance at thirty-*four of
the letters Judge Sloss continued the case
until Monday at 10 a. m.

EVENTFUL LIFE OF OLD
PIONEER COMES TO END
Captain Alonzo Green Passes Away
at Alamedaâ Funeral Will Be j
Held in This City.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 12.â Captain Alonzo
Green, who was the oldest member of the
Society of California Pioneers, died at hi3
home, 3237 Encinal avenue, last evening,
aged 92 years. His life's career was an
eventful and varied one.
In 1847 Green, then in the prime of . a
vigorous manhood, left Ohio, his native
State, and with "a party of companions
started for the gold fields of California,
by way of Panama. After arriving on
the Pacific side of the isthmus the hardy
band of argonauts secured a small
schooner and sailed north, with San Fran
cisco Bay as their destination. Somewhere
on the southern coast, supposed to be
near San Luis Bay, the little vessel of the
venturous treasure-seekers was driven
ashore in a tetrriflc southeaster and
wrecked. AH of those on board reached
land more dead than alive, but their en
tire stock of provisions and supplies was
lost.
With starvation upon them they struck
inland and northward, determined to foot
it to Yerba Buena, as San Francisco was
then called.
For days the party subsisted upon roots,
acorns and, as Captain Green often . re
lated, even ate rattlesnakes to appease
their hunger. The reptiles were plentiful
and were prepared for consumption much
after the manner that eels are cooked.
It was early in 1848 that Green and his
half-famished comrades reached Yerba
Buena. He remained there a short time
and then went to Sonora, where, in part
nership with E. C. Holden, he opened the
City Hotel, one of the famous caravansa
riei of early days, and which still stands
in the old mining town. In the early sev
enties Captain Green returned to San
Francisco and engaged in the grain and
commission business. He locaited In 187S
on Bay Farm Island, on what is now the
Swett ranch, Later he bought the Briggs
property on Central avenue, which after
ward passed into the hands of William J.
Dingee and subsequently became the
home of Mrs. Jack Hays.
Captain Green was a member of the
Town Trustees in 1877. For a number of
years he was the master of the bay
steamer Amador. He retired from active
life, over a decade ago. For the past three
years his health was feeble. - -.
Deceased leaves a wife, Mrs. Laura
Green, and three childrenâ Mrs Addie
Holt, Frank M. Green and Verdenal
Green. The funeral will take place to
morrow afternoon from Pioneer Hall San
Francispo, and will be conducted by the
Society of California Pioneers. '

Imprisonment for. Passing
Forged phecks. (
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 12.â In the United
States District Court to-day Ben Kilpat
rlck, the' Montana train robber suspect,
was sentenced by Judge Adams to fifteen
years .in the State penitentiary at Jeffer
son City, Mo. . .
The sentence followed a jury verdict
finding- the prisoner guilty, on one of the
seventeen counts In the indictment agalntt
him. ' .
Laura Bullion, indicted jointly with KUV
Patrick, was also found guilty on , one
count, but was not sentenced. . .
Judge Adams announced that he did not
wish to send the two prisoners to the
same penitentiary, and would defer sen
tence on the woman until he ascertained
whether it was within his jurisdiction to
send her to some penitentiary outside Mis
souri. " . .
When the jury had been selected it was
announced that Kilpatrick confessed that
he was guilty as charged in the twelfth
count of the indictment of passing bank
notes issued by the Secretary of the
Treasury, which had been altered, upon
Max Barnett in the city of St. Louis. â¢
He also announced that Miss Bullion
pleaded guilty* as charged in the thir
teenth count of the indictment of having
in her possession altered bank notes.
Thereupon the court ordered the jury to
retire. It required less than fifteen min
utes for the jury to agree upon a verdict
finding both defendants guilty.
KJlpatriek arid the Bullion woman were
arrested in this city more than a month
ago on suspicion that, they had some
thing to do with the hold-un of the Great
Northern train neap Wagner, Mont., last
July, when between $80,000 and $100,000 of
unsigned Helena National Bank notes
were . stolen from the express car. In
their possession when "arrested was found
about $10,000 of these notes, some of which
had the bank officials' names forged to

BISHOP NICHOLS CALLED

The troubles existing between Rev. Wil
liam Maxwell Reilly, rector of St. Paul's
Episcopal Church, and Alfred C. Rulof
son, one of the vestrymen, for several
months past are to be officially investi
gated by the Right Rev. William Ford
Nichols, Bishop of the diocese of Cali
fornia. '
The trouble had its origin in the re
fusal of 'Rev. Mr. - Reilly to recognize
Rulofson as junior-warden after his elec
tion to that office by the vestrymen to
succeed Dr. James M. Gassaway. Rev.
Reilly claimed Rulofson had not been
elected by a majority of the vestrymen,
but that is the only reason he assigns for
his opposition to Rulofson. When seen
last night he declined to discuss the af
fair. â  -. . / ..-,â â¢â '.â â

FIRE DAMAGES
SHIRT FACTORY
Neustadter Bros/ Estab
,* lishment Visited by
F.iames.
Fire broke out In the Standard Shirt
Factory at Gough and Grove streets last
night and for a time It threatened to de
stroy the entire building with .Its Con
tents.
Shortly after 9 o'clock John Carroll, the
watchman, "while standing . on the top
floor of the factory, discovered smoke is
suing from, the ventilator shaft. Running
down stairs he turned in an alarm from
the auxiliary box, which is situated . in
the building. A' few minutes later Police
Officer Bert Wren, seeing smoke issuing
from the root of the factory, sent in an
alarm from box 82, at Fulton and Gough
streets.
When the fire department reached the
scene'the interior of the factory was a
mass of flames. Several streams weYe
rapidly turned on and in a short time the
flre was extinguished. The* loss is esti
mated at about $2000, confined principally
to the drying room.
How the fire originated is a mystery to
Neustadter Bros., owners of the factory.

BANKS MUST PAY
TAX ON PROFITS
Internal Revenue Office
Piles Important
Ruling, i
J. W. Yerkes, Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, has rendered a decision that
will affect the banks of the Pacific Coast
to the extent of several million dollars,
which they will be required .to pay as in
ternal revenue tax on undivided profits.
In February, 1899, the United States At
torney General held that undivided profits
differ from surplus and should not be
taxed. Under this opinion the Treasuiy
Department refunded a large amount to
the banks.
Commissioner J. "W. Yerkes has Just
notified Collector Lynch that the depart
ment has decided to again collect the
tax on undivided profits. To some banks
this change In ruling will make a differ
ence of thousands of dollars each year.
The full decision is as follows:
The act of June 13, 1888. and the act of
March 2, 1801, provide that bankers using: or
employing a capital not exceeding $25,000 Bhall
pay $50; when using or employing a capital
exceeding $25,000, for every additional |1000
in excess of $25,000, $2; and in estimating: cap
ital surplus shall be included.
The law defines a banker and describes the
business of banking:. The law provides that
bankers shall pay tax on the capital employed
(I. e., employed in the business of banking),
ar.d that In estimating: capital surplus shall be
included.
This office holds that capital Is taxable
whether invested, as In the case of the United
States bonds or the bank building, or circulat
ing, as in the case of money. Including money
borrowed, also surplus including undividea
profits.
In providing that surplus shall be included as
capital it is obviously the purpose of the law
to have the tax imposed apply to all money
used or employed by banks as capital in carry
ing on their business.
Money borrowed by banks, and used as cap
ital. Is held to be taxable and It is clearly no
lees liable to tax because of the fact that it is
borrowed by a bank from its own undivided
profits.
The fact that surplus so used consists wholly
or in part of undivided profits, or that such
undivided profits have or have not been form
ally set ax>art for such use. seems wholly Im
material so far as the purpose of the act is
concerned. It is the use and not the authority
to use that brings such profits within the tax-
Ing- provisions of this act.
Banks should, therefore, return for taxation
the capital, the surplus fund, ' their undivided
profits or other profit and loss account, except
bo much thereof, as may be actually necessary
and has been set apart to meet ascertained lla
abillties and losses, or to pay dividends act
ually declared by the directors of the bank, to
pay taxes, or to pay fixed annual charges, such
as salaries and other necessary annual ex
penses.
The opinion of this office is that "capital and
surplus" Include all funds employed by the
bank in the business of banking, and that nat
urally and In the ordinary course of banking
business are so employed, excluding: only such
funds which, though temporarily used by the
bank, are of necessity withdrawn from the
banking business through the payments of divi
dends, taxes, ascertained losses or fixed charges
of whatever character.
Any decision of this office at variance with
the above la hereby rescinded.
I. W. Hellman Jr. in discussing the de
cision last evening eaid:
Last year the Commissioner of Internal Rev
enue decided that the banks need only pay
taxes on their capital and as much of their
eurplus as waa made necessary by the law.
Tfcat beyond that point they would not have to
pay national bank taxes. This decision pro
vides that not only will they have to pay
taxes on their" capital and their entire surplus,
but also on their entire undivided profitsâ that
Is, on all their profits that have not been di
vided among: their stockholders.
It will make a great difference to many
banks, because it has become customary among:
larjrer institutions to retain their surplus
profits In a fund known as undivided profits.
In a great many cases I the undivided profits
of the banks are as large as the combined cap
ital and surplus.
This decision will affect every bank on this
coast to the extent of $15,000 to $20,000 a year.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1901.
DECREES THAT RAILROAD MEN
SHALL ATTEND TO BUSINESS
President Harriman of the Southern Pacific Company Enforces
r Order That. Salaried .Officers of Corporation Must Surrender
Outside Employmentâ -Herrin to Close the Political Bureau
EH. HARK i MAN,/ president of
the Southern Pacific Com-'
pany. Is coming to j Cali
3 fornia as soon as he can de
tach himself from business af
fairs of importance in the East. He Is
taking an active Interest in everything
that directly concerns the corporation
over which he presides, and he derives
much information of value from the-as
sistant to the president, Julius \ Krutt
schnltt. Mr. Harriman Is much better
posted concerning affairs In California
than is fancied by most people, although
it is his purpose to acquire additional in
formation by a personal visit to San
Francisco. He said to W. H. Crocker in
New York a few days ago that he was
making arrangements for an early trip to
California. He hopes to arrive here the
latter part of April. H. E. Huntington
and W. F. Herrin are In New York at the
present time, but they are scheduled to
leave there for San Francisco next Tues
day. â¢
President Harriman has resolved that
men occupying responsible positions in
the service of the company and who draw
large salaries from the treasury of the
corporation shall in the future apply
themselves strictly to the business of the
railroad. If they cannot conform to the
new order of things proclaimed by the
president they will be expected to resign:
The business of the corporation has been
complicated by side issues, such as affairs
of the Market-street Railway, the Pacific
Improvement Company and the land and
the business of the late magnates. The
paymaster's office of the company has for
many years been a sort of clearing house
for the magnates and the heirs and suc
cessors of the four railway kings who
reigned so long In California.
Remnants of Old Complications.
Some of the old complications remain,
having been tightly fastened on the par
ent corporation by a long period of adhe
sion and cohesion.
Mr. Harriman Is firm in his determina^
tion that the company's men shall get out
of machine politics and keep out or look
elsewhere for employment. He has been
advised by practical and capable railway
menâ the experts who make a study of
transportation and the revenues to be de
rived from railway investments â that past
PROPRIETOR OF A SHOOTING GALLERY
ON DUPONT STREET FOULLY MURDERED
Adolph Oppenheimer, Who Was the Principal Witness in the Dur
rant Case, Victim of a Mysterious Assassin.
ADOLPH OPPENHEIMER, who
was one of the principal witness
es against Theodore Durrant,
hanged for the brutal murder of
Blanche Lamont, was mysterious
ly shot ano* killed late last night in a
shooting gallery which he had conducted
at 416 Dupont street. Robbery was ti:e
motive. He was shot from behind, the
bullet entering the small of the bacK and
causing instant -death.
Oppenheimer was alone In the gallery
when he was assassinated. Morris, his
16-year-old son, was in his room over the
gallery, when he heard a noise down
stairs and at once started an investiga
tion. On entering the gallery he found
the body of his murdered parent lying
in Realizlng C( that his parent was dead, he
went upstairs and excitedly Informed his
mother of what had happened. After
taking a hurried look at her dead hus
band Mrs. Oppenheimer, thinking that life
was not extinct, ran to- the office of Dr.
Rels, which Is only a short distance away,
and asked him to go with her to the gal
lery. Upon examining the body the med
ical man, not noticing the bullet hole in
the back, gave it as his opinion that
death was due to apoplexy. Police Offi
cer Brady, who was present, so reported
to the Coroner. . &
Shortly afterward Deputy Coroner Mc-
Cormick reached the scene. He thorough
ly examined the body and found the cause
of deathâ a bullet bole in the back made
by a 32-caliber pistol. McCormick at
once notified the police and detectives
were dispatched to make a thorough in
vestigation.
That robbery was the motive was
shown by the fact that a cigar box con
taining about 18, which represented the
day's receipts, was missing, it having
been taken by the murderer.
Missing Cigar-Box Contained $8.
Mrs. Oppenheimer says that she knows
the box contained at least $8, as her hus-

management of railroad affairs in Cali
fornia has had a tendency to provoke pub
lic irritation. Moreover the management
has been costly and cumbersome. It was
found after careful inquiry that -many of
the employes were in the oil business,
quite a number were engaged In large
landed â  enterprises, while others were
using the law department to .transact
business in which the company was, not
interested. It was ascertained that the
credit, the prestige and the clerical force
of the corporation had been used to ad
vance ' Individual interests. In several in
stances the use of the clerical force of
the company and the accommodations ex
tended for office convenience did .not
amount to acts of impropriety, but the
custom was not business like.
Tax Payments and Politics.
For example E. Black Ryan, who Is
recognized as one of the most capable and
successful tax attorneys of the State, -ia
In the enjoyment of a large private .or
semi-official practice which happens to
join closely with the company's business
of the same character. In olden days
Stanford, Crocker, Huntington and Hop
kins expected Mr. Ryan to look after land
taxes and titles. Through the successive
changes In the railway management he
has continued the outside tax business
at the same old stand in the company's
office. President Harriman has now given
out the word that employes must attend
to the company's business and that alone.
Perhaps Mr. Ryan has not heard officially
of this order, but he will be- fully ap
prised of the fact in due time.
General Manager Kruttschnltt has
doubtless informed the new president that
the law office of the Southern Pacific In
San Francisco is a sort of political ren
dezvous, where Republican and Demo
cratic politicians of the machine type
congregate at election times to receive
orders from "W. F. \ Herrin. ' Apart from
politics and railroading the company's
chief lawyer is the attorney for the Spring
Valley Water Works. He Is in position to
employ the political prestige of the rail
way corporation to assist the water com
pany in Its annual adjustment of rates.
Pavor of the High Court.
. There was an epoch In California when
Judges of the Supreme and Superior
courts looked to the railway corporation
for favor in the nominating convention.
Big clients got the impression that a iaw-
band had told her early In the evening
of the amount In the receptable.
The pistol which the murderer used was
the property of Oppenheimer and was
used by him in the shooting gallery.
From their investigation the detectives
who are working on the case are satisfied
that the murderer went into the gallery
and pretended to be anxious to try . his
hand at shooting at the inanimate tar
gets. As Oppenheimer faced the targets,
with hia back turned to the murderer, he
was shot, dying, presumably, instantly.
A few minutes after the fatal shot had
been fired three soldiers entered the place
and, seeing Oppenheimer lying on the
floor with his face downward, concluded
that he was asleep. Falling to awaken
him by calling to him, they helped them
selves to pistols and blazed away at the
targets. " " \ â 
Oppenheimer â  formerly kept a pawn
shop, and It ! was at his place that
Durrant pawned some jewelry which he
had stolen from Blanche Lamont after he
had foully murdered her. The identifica
tion of Durrant as the man who had
pawned the dead girl's jewelry was one
of the strongest links in the chain of evi
dence against him. ' .
Morris Oppenheimer, the 16-year-old
son of the murdered man, said:
I was sitting upstairs shortly before mid
night -when I heard a. single shot. Almost sim
ultaneously with the shot I heard a low moan
and a fall. I did not think this very strange,
for frequently at that hour drunken strag
glers come into the gallery "broke" and be
fore they have a chance to shoot .any more
than one shot, without paylne my father gen
erally takes the pistol away from them. Then
again very often they got to quarrelling
among / themselves and throw one another
down, so I did not bother to go downstairs un
til I heard four or five men come in below
and say, "Oh, you're asleep, eh! Well, we'll
shoot anyway," or words to that effect. Then
I knew there was something wrong.
Does Not Think Robbery Was Motive
I went downstairs quickly and" found the
soldiers still there, and my father was lying
In the corner behind the counter, close to the
north wall of the gallery. I â  did not suspect

yer who happened to be closely, associated
with the railroad would, bo just the right
kind of a lawyer to handle questions of
law Involving the settlement of disputes
in court arising from the distribution of
princely estates. ,W. F. Herrin, the rail
road's chief counsel, has had many of the
rich outside plums. The Call does not in
timate that President Harriman Is so nar
row in his views of life, and especially
life in the great and growing West, that
he would restrict every lawyer to one
client, but The Call receives positive in
formation that Mr. Harriman wants the
law business of the company attended to
by a lawyer who can give all his time and
attention to that business. It is the presi
dent's impression that lawyers ought not
to be overworked or overrated. He holds
that the businsa of the company is so
vast, so varied and important that the ex
clusive services of one lawyer are de
manded to direct it. If Mr, Herrin can
not afford to surrender a lucrative out
side practice In order to give his whole
time to the company's affairs he will b6
readily accorded the privilege of looking
to some place other than the corporation's
treasury for compensation for his ipgal
talents. In. the field of politics the chief
counsel's career Is checkered by a long
chain of reverses, hence it is claimed that
Harriman sees neither glory nor gain by
the interference of the railroad in the
political affairs of this State. Herrin is
at present in New York. The president
called him there for consultation ami
when he returns he will bear with him
the new decree that the officers and em
ployes of the Southern Pacific must work
exclusively for the railroad.
The Pacific Improvement Company now

Hereafter all the business of this side

employes. The pay offices and the cleri
cal force of the railway corporation will
not be used as of old for the convenience
cf the Pacific Improvement Company.
The Market-street Railway still uses to
some extent the Southern Pacific's pay

murder or that he had been shot. I thought
that he had fainted, so I ran upstairs. -and woke
my mother and then ran down to ,Bayles f drug
store and summoned Dr. Relss. v - The doctor
came and pronounced the case one of apoplexy.
As soon as the deputy coronerÂ»Â±urned my
father's body over and discovered mat he was
shot in the back I knew that four murder had
been done.
I believe that my father was murdered by
people who have been persecuting us on ac
count of our rellslon and success In business.
I will not speak of my suspicions now. I want
to be sure first before I make any charges. I
don't think robbery was the motive. Perhaps
the soldiers who came In after the murderer
left took the money, thinking my father was
asleep.
From their conversation, which I could hear
very distinctly upstairs, I would not think
that they had any hand In It or even knew that
my father was lying there dead. After the
soldiers shot the six shots they said "Well
come on, let's go." but when I came down
stairs they were still there, or, at least that
is my impression. I was excited, however,
and may be mistaken about that. If they were
not there, then they came back immediately
after. I am positive that after firing the shots
the men said, "Well, come on, let's go."
Policeman Brady was called to the scere
soon after the finding of Oppenhelmev's
body. It was close to 12 o'clock and Bradv
was due at the station at midnight, so
after Dr. Relss pronounced him a victim
of apoplexy, Brady left the scene and
made his report to Lieutenant Birdsall.
Â« ft .S r the discovery by Deputy Coroner
McConnack that murder had been done,
Sergeant Tom Bethel appeared upon the
scene. Sergeant Bethel took up the in
vestigation and ordered one of his men
to report the case to headquarters. De
tectives O'Dea and Whittaker were de
tailed on the case.
Isadore Heymafnt a companion of young
Oppenheimer, was in bed upstairs and he
tells the same story of the affair as did
the murdered man's son.-

gin to Testify This Morn
ing.
. The trial of James M. Dunphy for the
murder, of Edward Stanton on September
27 last was resumed in Judge .Cook's
court yesterday. Thomas E. Cohen, pro
prietor of a cigar store at Sixth and Min
na streets, testified to a conversation he
had with Dunphy' about a week before
the murder. Dunphy asked for Stanton,
and although Dunphy â¢ made no threats
Cohen was satisfied from his demeanor
that he intended harm to Stanton.
Maurice Durbin, a brother of the mur
dered man, testified as to what had hap
pened on the Friday night when Dunphy
claimed he had been "Jumped" by Stan
ton and four or five of his friends. He
said that Stanton had been at his sister's
house -with some friends and when they
left they met Dunphy on the corner. Dun
phy and his brother shook hands and
there was no trouble. Dunphy and his
brother conversed together for about an
hour and a half, and the witness over
heard Dunphy say that if his sister had
â got herself into trouble she was i able to
take care of herself. â¢ .
. Morlz Abt, grocer, 429 Minna street, tes
tified that he heard 'shots and on going
outside he saw Dunphy shooting at a body
that was lying on the sidewalk and walk
away.- He saw the body placed in- the
patrol wagon and noticed there was a ci
garette in the man's mouth. â¢*
Dr. Z. T. Malaby of the Emergency
Hospital testified as to the nature of Stan
ton's wounds, which closed the case for
the prosecution. The defense will go on
this morning.
Stanton is not the name under which
the defendant was born. His father's
name was Durbin, but he was adopted at
the age of 11 >by a man named Stanton
and has since borne that name.
