It was also said that Northern Pacific 4's

More Roads Included.
Practically no additional news was ob

finally effected yesterday, and those di

worked out in connection with any roal

war in South Africa the Times says to
day: "The Boers, as far back as last May,
were guilty of murdering whole kraals of
Kaffirs in order to destroy the traces of
the movements of their own commandoes.
The British authorities at the time, for
some reason not specified, prohibited any
mention of these outrages."

rates and prevent the contest for control
such as occurred last summer.
Competition Is Avoided.
It is further said that the territory west
of Chicago is to be divided in such a way
that competition will in a great measure
be avoided on any except wholesome
lines, and there will be a large increase
in net earnings for all concerned. There
were fanciful suggestions in regard to
another proprietary company, to take in
the Union Pacific, the Northwestern and
the St. Paul roads, but it is declared to
be too early to give any details about the
schemes. The notion that they are to be
controlled by the Northern Securities
Company was generally discredited, for
the reason that a further increase in tho
colossal aggregation of capital might en
courage adverse legislation.
The question that most interested tho
financial community to-day In connection
with the big combination was how much
cash had been required to put througn
the scheme and whether the money mar
ket would be deserted at the time when
the surplus of the local banks is at a low
level.
Financiers who are interested in th. 1
deal soon dispelled all doubt on this sub
ject by declaring that the underwriting
syndicate would have little to do, one
authority asserting that not more than
$6,000,000 to $10,000,000 would be required.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â 1f the
President adopts the views of many
prominent military and naval officers
who have recently returned from the
Philippines he will restore the military to
complete governmental control, to the ex
clusion of Governor Taft's authority.
I It would not be surprising should it de
velop that this is one of the matters to
which the President has been giving spe
cial attention in his recent conversations
with prominent members of Congress. It
is his purpose to carefully discuss thi
Philippine situation in his annual mes
sage to Congress, and before framing this
feature he desires to get all the light upon
it that he can. The President under
stands the view of military men that
while the rebellion in the Philippines is
no longer organized outbreaks and unrest
may be expected for years, and until the
islands have been pacified It Is useless to
attempt to establish civil government. Hc
is now waiting to receive the report o:
Governor Taft and his associates, who
form the Philippine Commission. This
report was started on its way to the
â¬ T nitcd States^ but the tram/port bringing
it sustained an accident and was com
pelled to put into Nagasaki for repairs.
Another transport was sent to Nagasaki
to receive the report, but she was unfor
tunate in having a breakdown on leaving
Nagasaki, and the quartermaster oti
board deemed it necessary to return. The
Hancock has gone to Nagasaki to get the
report, and it is hoped she will bring It
safely to San Francisco.
Senators Lodge and Spooner were in
consultation wHh the President yesterday
and again to-day, and it is understood the
Philippines situation was discussed. It is
the general impression, despite the views
of the military, that the President will
not, for the present at least, abandon the
plan for civil Rovernment which McKin
ley inaugurated.
SHIPS LOST ON
BRITISH COAST
During the Present Storm
Fifty Vessels Go Down
and Over 180 Men Perish
LONDON, Nov. 15.â 1t is still impossi
ble to estimate with any exactitude the
total loss of life and property resulting
from the protracted gale, and probably
the full extent of the damage will never
be known.
Much wreckage of unidentified vessels
is still being thrown up. Altogether it is
known that some fifty vessels have been
wrecked along the British coast. Thirty
four of these have been absolutely
wrecked, involving, it Is believed, a loss
of more than 180 drowned. The Yar
mouth lifeboat disaster alone leaves
forty-four fatherless children.
BELFAST, Nov. 14.â From wreckage
seen in Belfast Lough to-day it is sup

has been lost and her crew of nine
drowned.

/NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The largest of
tnree pythons in the Central Park menag
erie felt hungry to-day. It crawled over
to a tank of water, where three young
alligators were lying asleep, and swal
lowed the largest one, which measured
two feet eight inches. The snake was
eight feet long.
Jake Cook, the keeper, entered the
building as the snake was completing its
meal. He reached the cage in time to
see the alligator's tail twitching as it dis
appeared from view. The other two alli
gators were taken from the cage, lest the
snake swallow them also. When the
snake stretched itself on the floor there
was an apparent bulge in the middle, and
the outlines of the alligator could be seen
plainly. Superintendent Smith was sur

DISPUTE OVER BUSINESS MATTERS
ENDS IN SHOOTING OF AN UNCLE
BY THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW
Two Other Members of the Family, Representing the Opposing Fac
tions, Start the Feud at Early Morning by Wild Revolver Practice
. in Foundry in Which They Are Employed, One Being Wounded
A FEUD among the members of two
branches of the Caldarella fam
ily, one of which is headed by
Frank Caldarella, the proprietor
of a fruit store at 102 Second
street, and the other by Luigi Caldarel'a.,
proprietor of a saloon at 245 Third street,
culminated yesterday in a series of shoot
ing affrays, in which Frank was possibly
fatally wounded, George Orlando, a
brother-in-law of Luigi, was shot in the
hand, and a special officer named J. G.
King received a slight wound in the hip.
About a year ago the Caldarellas were
jointly interested in the fruit store at 102
Second street. They disagreed and Frank
bought out the interest of Luigi, who
thejl opened a saloon. The latter had sent
previously for his two sons, who were
then in Sicilyâ Michael, aged about 17, and
George, aged 13. Both of these arrived in
San Francisco last November and es
poused their father's cause. Against
George, the younger, two charges of as
sault to murder are pending as a result
of yesterday's fray, and a similar charge
is hanging over his elder brother. One
of the charges against George may be
changed into murder, there being a prob
ability that the injuries inflicted by his
pistol upon his uncle Frank may result
seriously.
About 7;30 o'clock yesterday morning,
when George Orlando, who is a brother
in-law of Luigi Caldarella, was about to
go to work for the Roylance Brass Works
at 112-14 Main street, he had a dispute
with Frank Mangini, who is employed
there and who is a brother-in-law of
Frank Caldarella, over the possession of
a seat. Both men were in the finishing
room, and Mangini pulled out his pistol
and fired two shots at Orlando. The lat
ter ran around the corner of the finishing
room toward the entrance and returned
the fire. For a few minutes the shooting
was lively, and Olando received a bullet
in his left hand and Mangini retreated to
the rear.
Police Officer Mackay was called in and
he sent Orlando, to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital and later to the Harbor police
station, where he was booked on a charge
of assault to commit murder.
Shooter Makes Escape.
Officer Mackay, aided by Officer Ing
ham, made a search of the brass works
for Mangini. They were informed by em
ployes that he had run through the build
ing, dropped his revolver in his flight, re
turned and later went into the cellar.
Officer Mackay made a search of the cel
lar, but could not find his man. Ascer
taining his address, the officers went to
the residence of Frank Caldarella, 553
Howard street, where he resided, and pro

ceeded to search the place. Frank Cal
darella was induced by Officer Mackay to
go down Third street from his residence
to search for Mansrini.
Just as Frank was passing the corner
of Tehama street George Caldarella, the
13-year-old son of Luigi. began firing ar
him. One bullet struck the old man in
the head and the second penetrated his
shoulder blade. The lad fired a thirl
shot, which is probably the one that
grazed Special Officer King.
George, pursued by Officer Mackay. ran
around \o the rear end of his father's sa
loon, at 245 Third street, and as he dashed
into the door Michael, who was tending
bar for the father while the latter waÂ«
arranging for the release of Orlando at
the Hall of Justice, fired a shot at Mack

IT was almost a repetition of Monday

There were but few people not found in

ADVERTISEMENTS.
GRAU and the
WEBER PIANO.
Gentlemen:
It Is my -wish, and that of the opera
company, that the "Weber Piano shall
be used at the opera-house next season
as heretofore. The magnificent Con-
cert Grands which you have sent us
for- the Sunday night concerts have
more than confirmed the impression
that in tone quality, power and carry-
ing capacity the Weber has no superior
in the world. The leading artists of
the company have privately expressed
to me their delight in the instruments
(both Grands and Uprights) furnished
for their private use and It is the'
unanimous verdict that for concert
work, as well as for accompanying the
voice in singing, the Weber piano is
un equaled.
With regards and best wishes for
your continued prosperity, believe me, 'Â¦

was as beautiful as on Monday night, as
â¢lyrically pure of voice, as high, fine and
gracious, but there was a tenderness
there last night that Elsa somewhat
lacked, a power and even passion.
Just to look at Mme. Eames is a gift
of price. In these music dramas in which
every art known to man feels dimly aft^r
God in chorus, it is no small thing that
the pictures should be beautiful. Every
movement that Eames makes is music.
h.ach fold of her gowns forms subtle har
monies with its neighbor, and their color
and texture show the artist hand at every
turn. She sings Elisabeth as if she loved
it. and the role suits her admirably. The
"Prayer" was a superb effort, and Eames
is .now fully established as a first favor
ite in the Grau firmament.
Van Dyck was not quite up to the pitch
in tne title role. He sang with quite ap
parent effort until the end of the second
act, when he rose nobly to the occasion.
I have reason to believe that he was
somewhat indisposed, and it certainly
sounded that way. But in the song tour
nament he seemed to have conquered his
indisposition and Sang with a power
abandon, thrill, that simply carried
everything before him. It was a dazzling
second act all through.
The stage picture alone was worth the
money, as to the gallant swing of the
famous march, belted knights and coifed
dames, resplendent in all the magnificence
of a splendid century, came trooping in in
seemingly endless pageant. The march
went with all the necessary spirit, but
the male chorus that follows was an even
finer piece of work. It was delightfully
dene last night.
Of Bispham as Wolfram nothing but
good may be said. He is at his best here.
The tender and vibrant fiber of his voice
suits exactly the noble character of
Wolfram, and he sang the part with a
sympathy, tenderness and power that left
nothing to be desired. He Is Wolfram for
the time being, and there was nothing on
the programme last night more artistic
than his interpretation. Mr. Muhlmann
was the King, and "a royal old soul was
he. He was vocally everything that was

THERE was Joy in the hearts of the
Wagnerites who gathered last

in full force at the production of
the Master of Beyreuth's "Tann

There was all the glamor and excitement
of a first night at the gathering of the
audience that heard Wagner's superb
composition. Again there was a line of
carriages bearing gaily dressed women
and their escorts; the police were kept
busy in keeping a clear passageway for
the fortunate ones who entered the opera
house: the top galleries were packed to
suffocation by the lovers of music, and the
shimmer of silk and satin together with
the flash of gorgeous gems were seen in
all parts of the auditorium.
When Director Damrosch brought the
big orchestra to attention and the open
ing strains of the "Pilgrim's March" were
heard, there were but few vacant seats
in boxes, orchestra or dress circle. The
lights were lowered and the curtain
ascended, disclosing the grotto of Venus,
with Tannhauser reclining at the feet of
the Goddess of Love.
Madame Eames Again Triumphs.
For four hours the vast audience lis
tened to the marvelous composition that
Wagnerites claim is the very essence' of
music, but which the disciples of the Ital
ian school designate as a mere fad.
The audience was not % an enthusiastic
nearer the song than any other composer
has yet come. It is the human method,
men are men in it and not vocal machines,
and of the wonders of his orchestra, every
instrument an individual entity, picturing
with strange magic the undercurrents and
high dreams of the soul, who shall ade
quately praise it?
"UNHAPPILY MAKBIED
FOLK IN DIVORCE COURT
Sundry Couples Secure Decrees and
Others Invoke the Law to
Sever Irksome Bonds.
Lotta A. Covell, who was married to
George F. Covell In Kings County In Au
gust, 1893, was granted a divorce yester
day by Judge Hunt on the ground of
cruelty. Mrs. Covell testified that her
husband's cruel treatment consisted of
perpetual "nagging" and accusing her of
Infidelity. She also said that on several
occasions he struck her. The Covells are
prominent people of Fresno County and
possess considerable property in various
parts of the State. The question of prop
erty rights was not brought into court,
a satisfactory arrangement and division
having been made by the couple since the
commencement of the action.
Divorces were granted yesterday to
Winifred Bentley from Marshall G. Bent
ley for desertion, Robert Munch from
Catherina Munch for desertion, Ida Mul
ler from Aleck Muller for cruelty, Myron
Henry Shepard from Alice Jane Shepard
for desertion and Maud Reilly from John
H. Reilly for willful neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by Charles F. Short against Ida B. Short
for desertion and Mary J. Barden against
one by any means. There was none of the
wild applause that had greeted Madame
Sembrich on the previous night in "La
Traviata." Madame Eames.who sang Elis
abeth, was given a hearty reception and
she won curtain calls by her exquipite vo
calization. The diva was in better voice
than on her first appearance on Monday
last, and her pure notes rang out clear
and true, filling every portion of the the
ater.
It was recognized by all present that
Van Dyck was suffering from a cold, but
he improved after the first act and sang
and acted with fire and vigor. Bispham
sang Wolfram and again demonstrated
that he is one of the best barytones on
the operatic stage. Madame Reuss-Belce,
who made her debut as Venus, quickly
placed herself en rapport with her audi
ence. Miss Fritzi-Scheff obliged the
management by singing the role of the
ShepTierd, owing to the indisposition of
Miss Bridewell.
Many Supper Parties Given.
When the story of the struggle between
pure and unchaste love was ended the big
audience wended its way to the streets.
Carriages dashed up in almost endless
number and the carefully cloaked ladies
were escorted to fashionable supper
rooms. In the courtyard of the Palace
Hotel the tables were filled by dozens of
merry parties and while the corks of
champagne bottles popped the details of
the opera were discussed. If the Grau
Opera Company is patronized at each per
formance as it was last night the man
agement will have a warm spot in its
heart for San Francisco.
"Die Walkure" will be sung to-night
and to-morrow afternoon "Faust" is sure
to attract a throng. To-morrow evening

Judge Seawell yesterday, by request of
the attorneys of Louise A. Corwell, who
is - suing Charles Corwell for divorce on
the ground of cruelty, ordered the court
room cleared and will try the case behind

IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC DIS-
COVERY.
A Clinical Preparation That Positive-
ly Kills the Dandruff Germ.
A most important discovery has been
made after a year's patient laboratory
work aimed in a certain direction. It is j
Newbro's Herpicide, a preparation that !
cures baldness, prevents falling hair, and !
speedily and permanently eradicates dan- i
druft*. These evils are caused by a germ <
or parasite that burrows into the scalp i
throwing ud dandruff, as it seeks to sap
the life of the hair at the root. There's !
no baldness without falling or thin hair '
no thin hair wtihout dandruff, and no i
dandruff if the germ is destroyed. New- I
bro'a Herpicide is the only preparation
that will do the work. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect" i
society will give a welcome to Sybil San
derson, who appears in "Manon," essay
ing the role in which she triumphed in
Paris and St. Petersburg. "La Boheme"
is to be given Sunday night at popular

POSITIVE NEWS
OF MISS STONE
She Is on the Bulgarian
Frontier in Custody
of Brigands.
Authorities at Washington
Expect That She Will
Soon Be Free.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â The liber
ation of Miss Ellen M. Stone, the captive
American missionary, seems at last on
the verge of accomplishment. The report
this morning: of the death of Miss Stone
aroused the most painful apprehension on
the part of the officials of the State De
partment. This has been dissipated and
a distinct feeling of optimism is expressed
to-night as the result of authoritative in
formation establishnig conclusively that
the report is absolutely without founda
tion. Consul General Dickinson cabled to
Secretary Hay that Miss Stone is not only
living and well but he has positively lo
ceted her. She is on Bulgarian territory
and 1b still held by her abductors. The
energetic protests made by Dickinson to
the authorities at Sofia have resulted in
the abandonment of their intention to
dispatch a force of troops io destroy the
brigands and rescue Miss Stun.. "They
now propose to take no action until after
the woman has been released. The de
partment officials declined to state their
reasons for encouraging the inferences
they draw from Dickinson's mi ssage in
relation to Miss Stone's early release, but
one went so far as to intimate that by
to-morrow morninpf definite news would
be received. It is admitted, however, that
the brigands have not yet modified their
original demand for $110,000. It has been
represented to them that it Is impossible
to pay any such sum. The State Depart
ment does not propose to permit its agents
to dicker with the outlaws. While nat
urally anxious to secure the release of
Miss Btone for the smallest sum possible,
the department recognizes the fact that
the charitable people of the country con
tributed $66,000 for the definite purpose of
effecting the liberation of the American
missionary and they are prepared to hand
over this sum if it be demanded.
The authorities decline to divulge the
exact location of Miss Stone. It is near
the frontier, so that in case the Bulgarian
trooos should march in the direction of
their present refuge the outlaws can eas
ily retire into Turkis-h territory. Officials
of the department say the fact that the
outlaws have permitted the American
Consul General to learn their exact
whereabouts shows they place confidence
In hire, and this in itself is a point gained.
It is DOssible that the transfer of Mies
Stone to the agents of the missionaries
and Consul General Dickinson may take
place at the point where she now is.

Bright's
Disease.
A CARD.
L&st Saturday's Bulletin contained a
double-column article, with interviews, on
| the discovery in this city of a cure for
Bright's Disease and Diabetes. Being un-
' paid news, it gave the details of the dis-
covery, its Investigation by a number of
business men disclosing nearly 90 per cent
of recoveries, and its subsequent pur-
chase, but did not identify it by name or
address.
As the interviews were with a number
of well-known San Francisco business
men, who recovered under the treatment
and gave their names and addresses, the
most accessible of them have been be-
sieged with inquiries, causing them much
annoyance.
We therefore desire to say to all inter-
ested that the cures were made by what
are known as the Fulton Compounds and
that the full details of the Investigation
that was the subject of the article, in-
cluding the clinical reports on nearly
three dozen test cases and reports on
nearly a hundred others, have been
printed and will be mailed free on appli-
cation.
It is a solemn fact that about 87 per cent
of all cases of Bright's Disease and Dia-
betes put on the Fulton Compounds are
recovering.

LORD ROSEBERY SCORES
BRITISH POLITICIANS
Would Like to See Government Formed
by Such Men as Carnegie and Lipton.
LONDON, Nov. 14â Lord Rosebery, speaking to-night in Edin
burgh, said he did not intend again to try to secure a reform of
the House of Lords, as this was not a task for an individual/but
one needing a national impulse. "I would like to see." he con
tinued, "an experiment for a year of a Government formed en
tirely of business men, such, for example, as Mr. Carnegie and Sir
Thomas Lipton, instead of politicians. I ask you: Are we getting our
moneys worth fÂ«rr the money spent? We are beginning to learn the les
son that great measures must in future be carried more by the harmony
of contending parties or by the agreement of belligerent politicians than
by thc-overpowering ascendency of any one faction in the country."
Continuing, the speaker said he blamed no party and blamed no
Government, but saw around him questions demanding solution and a '
general apathy and impotence to deal with them. Political parties, he said,
must on occasion be willing to sink their differences and forget who was
in power and who would get credit for the carrying out of measures if
they wished those measures to be carried out.
MASTER WORKMAN BURNS ARRAIGNS
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR
Declares the Organization Headed by Gompers Disgraced
Itself in Not Supporting Steel Strikers.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 14.â At the
national convention of the Knights of La
bor to-day General Master "Workman Si
mon Burns submitted his annual report,
which consisted largely of an attack on
the American Federation of Labor. The
general executive committee and Secre
tary-Treasurer Hays also reported.
General Master Workman Burns in his
annual message said:
The first great struggle" between organized
labor and a great trust' was between the Am
algamated Association of Iron and Steel Work
ers and the United States Steel Corporation. It
matters not what errors and mistakes are
charged to the officers and members of the
Amalgamated Association; the facts are that
the steel companies were victorious because of
treachery and failure of organized labor to do
its duty. The Amalgamated Association ex
pected at least the friendship of the officers
and members of the American Federation of
Labor. They received nothing ' but deception
and opposition. It is a question If the Am
algamated Association would have entered
the contest under the circumstances If it were
not for the promises made and relied upon
from the members of the American Federation
of Labor to assist them for what they believed
to be right. N Â¦ %
Scores Federation Leaders.
During the last great strike of the coal
miners and those affiliated with them, the
public, the Knights of Labor and other inde
pendent labor organizations contributed more
to the financial aid and success of the miners
than the federation, yet the federation re
ceived the credit, and in return they attempt
to disrupt organizations better than theirs.
In the late steel strike members connected
with the American Federation of Labor, after
their local organizations refused to contribute
.to the steel workers, solicited money from in
dependent labor organizations for the purpose
oÂ£ helping the Amalgamated Association men
who were affiliated with them. If they had
secured any money, or If the steel strike had
been won by the workers, the federation would
have claimed the credit. The officers and
mombers of this great Federation of Labor
had the opportunity of their lives to demon
strate what they, with their great numbers,,
could do; but through fear of their organ
ization or the influence brought to bear on
some of them, they failed .to prove themselves
worthy of the name of organized labor.
Any organization or law that prevents or
opposes the helping of organized labor finan
cially when in need had better be wiped out.
The leaders of the American Federation of
Labor did not want President Shaffer or his
organization to win because It might have
given the organization and 'President Shaffer
some - prestige and prominence. The largest
political organization to-day is the Federation
of Labor, using the name of labor for ad
vancing a few men politically to the great in
jury of the many. Any labor organization
that advances or, benefits the wage-earner
should be encouraged, but such a political or
ganization, using the workingmen for a blind
chould be known by its true name and repu
tation.
In the city of Plttsburg. the greatest Indus
trial city of the world, organized labor has
been working in harmony, accomplishing some
gOJd In its labor league, where all organiza
tions were welcome as members regardless of
whom they might be affiliated with, until a
few months ago when the paid organizers and
the national officers of the federation started
a movement to disrupt the labor league of
Western Pennsylvania, which has existed for
e-ne years. The" made a special attack nn
the Knights of Labor, and without any good
reason This movement of theirs, like Koine
other of their actions, will react against them!
j â¢ Legislation of Trusts.
The Jrreat combinations of capital known as
trusts' should receive careful consideration
of ail wage workers, the merchant, business
man and particularly the voter. The argument
made that they are a help financially to the
wage worker is denied by many, and I aeree
with the number that say that they are in
jurious and will grow more bo as they grow
older. There are a few combinations that are
better and more favorable to workers than
others, but the? reasons are because of the con
ditions existing in a few trades that do not
exist in many others. If combinations or
trusts were formed for the purpose of secur
ing a fair return on the actual amount of capi
tal Invested and not to depreciate the number
of employes, lower wages and oppose labor,
then they misht be considered a benefit to the
wage workers. The Government that grants
them franchises and charters should restrict
and control them, and the people should con
trol both the Government and the trusts,
which they do not do at the present time Be
fore the election the voters are the people and
the Government: after the election the politi
cians are the Government, the people, judiciary
and all.
Some argue that trusts and comoinatlons
cheapen the product to the consumer and in
some cases give good wages to their employes
This may be true, but that does not benefit
.the majority of the people. It is not cheap
products and cheap living the majority of the
people require, but high wages and steady em
ployment. When the mechanic and wage
worker is steadily employed at good wages he
can afford to pay high prices to the farmer
i storekeeper and merchant. Labor is not an
tagonistic to capital except when it becomes
oppressive.- If the Government does not inter
fere, restricting and controlling, trusts those
large combinations of capital wik control the
Government and the people.
DISCUSS CABLE
AND CANAL BILLS
Congressmen Hepburn
and Sherman Confer
With President.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.âRepresenta
tive Hepburn of lowa, chairman of the
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Com
mittee of the House, and Representative
Sherman of New York, a member of the
name committee, had a long conference
with the President to-day about the isth
mian canal and Pacific cable legislation.
As a result of the consultation, they an
nounced that it was their purpose to press
legislation on both subjects at the earliest
possible moment.
The canal bill which passed the House
at the last session will be relntroduced
in substantially the form in which it was
passed last winter. No delay is antici
pated in the committee, as the whole sub
ject has been canvassed thoroughly.
Colonel Hepburn told the President that
the bill undoubtedly would have a large
majority in the House.
The cable bill will be identical with
the one reported from the committee dur
ing the last Congress. It provides for the
laying of the cable by a private corpora
tion under a contract with the Postmaster
General, with an alternative provision for
the building of the cable by the Govern
ment If no satisfactory contract can be
made. It is understood that the Presi
dent concurred in the proposed pro
gramme,
There Is no doubt in the minds of many peo
rle that money and its influences changes the.
opinions and decisions of officials who should
be for right* and justice. Trusts should be
controlled by ! the Government, and all facts

A business talk about a
I business suit
\ Over one-half \of a man's life is spent in his business clothes. They must withstand
hard wear and at the same time retain their shape and look well. We want to make a sug-
gestion to the man who likes to dress well at a nominal cost. Instead of buying an expensive
suit, suppose he orders two of our $9.00 ready-to-wear sack suits and wears them alter-
nately. Worn this way they will last long and look neat. While one suit is being worn the
other can be left with us for cleaning and pressing. We make no charge for this.
I You can select one suit of serge or cheviot and the other of tweed or worsted â one
I can be solid color and the other fancy pattern. Every suit is cut in the-latest style and made
up in the most approved manner. .
ji The man who tries this suggestion is going to dress well and reduce his clothing bill
considerably. - \ |

STAGE DRIVER
WOUNDS BANDIT
Worsts Lone Highway
man in Duel With
Revolvers.
Attempt to Rob the Chico
West Branch Coach Is
Frustrated.
CHICO. Nov. 14.â Plucky T. "W. Finch
ley, the driver of a stage on the West
Branch line, emerged victorious fram a
battle with a lone highwayman at 1:30
o'clock this afternoon and prevented the
robbery ot his coach. The outlaw was
wounded in the arm by a bullet from the
driver's revolver and saved himself by
flight. He la now in hiding in. Chico Can
yon,- and to-morrow a score of men will
be roaming that wild region In search of
him.
Finchley was driving up the grade be
tween Berdans and West Branch. At a
point about twenty miles from this city,
and when near the top of the hill, a high
wayman with a barley sack over his head
and sacks wrapped about his feet stepped
from behind a tree. Pointing a revolver
at the driver, he demanded that whatever
valuables were on board be thrown out
to him. Finchley made a move for his
revolver, and while he was in the act of
drawing his weapon the robber fired at
him, but missed. Finchley by this time
had his revolver out and returned the fire.'
After a sharp exchange of shots the rob
ber started on a run down Chico CaJiyon
toward the flume. Finchley continued fir
ing, and at the last shot the robber
dropped his revolver, which he had held
in his right hand. After running a few
feet the highwayman retraced his steps
to where he had dropped the weapon, and
picking It up in his left hand continued
his retreat toward the bottom of the can
yon. Evidently the robber's right arm
was disabled by the driver's shot. Finch
ley fired six shots and the robber five.
None of the bullets hit the driver.
Thomas Fleck and John Willis, both
experienced mountaineers, started imme
diately" on the trail of the robber. Chico
Canyon, in which the highwayman is in
hiding, is an extremely rough country,
filled with ravines and underbrush, and it
will be a difficult matter to track the
bandit. Late this evening several county
officers left for the scene of the robbery
and will take up the chase at daylight to
morrow.
MRS. BOTKIN'S
SISTER INSANE
Miss Dora Brown Be
comes a Hopeless
Maniac.
Brooding Over Disgrace Upon
Her Family Dethrones
Reason.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Â«Nov. 14.â Constant
brooding over the crime of her sister.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, who by sendirg
poisoned candy through the mails mur
dered Mrs. John P. Dunning and Mrs. J
D. Deane, daughters of former Congress
man Pennington, has dethroned the rea
son of Miss Dora Brown, and the unfor
tunate young woman ;s; s now a hopeless
maniac.
Miss Brown imagines that her sister is
destined to eternal damnation and that
through love she must brave fiery tor
ments. She attempted to hurl herself into
the futnace of a railway locomotive yes
terday evening. When the evening train
stopped at the station in Healdsburg thu
engineer left his cab for a moment an I
upon his return found Miss Brown an oc
cupant of the cab. In order to frigrhteu
her into leaving the engine the furnac
door was thrown open. This was what
the young woman wanted, and if it hal
not been for the quick action of the en Â¦
gineer she would have leaped in upon the
burning coals.
Miss Brown is about 45 years old. Her
home is in Ferndale, Humboldt County,
but she has been staying with relatives
in Healdsburg. The disgrace brought upon
the family by her sister's crime has been
felt very keenly by Miss Brown, and her
mind has finally given way under the
strain. She will be confined in some in
stitution as soon as the necessary for
malities can be gone through with.
Miss Brown's parents are both dead.
They passed out of this world unconscious
of the crime with which their daughter,
Mrs. Botkin, was charged. Zealous mem
bers of the Seventh Day Adventist faith,
they were people of very simple lives, an.l
their children shielded them in their okl
age from all knowledge of the dtsjfrace
that had come upon the family.
LONDON, Nov. 14.â A receiver has been ap
pointed to settle the affairs of "The Whirl
of the Town" theatrical company.

GLADIATORS WILL MEET TO-NIGHT IN THE PRIZE RING
TO DECIDE THE HEAVY-WEIGHT BOXING CHAMPIONSHIP
DR. MOSKIMAN
THE WHOLE SHOW
Pitches Phenomenal Ball,
Allowing Only Two
Scratch Hits.
Ewlng's "Old World" cripples took
a decided brace yesterday at Recreation
Park. They surprised both themselves
and the spectators by getting on the
proper side of a one to nothing score in
a fast and snappy contest with the An
gels. There vÂ«as nothing to it but Moskl
man. From the time that game was
called until Dougherty made the last out
to Streib the doctor was the bright, par
ticular star. He had Morley's heavy slug
gers completely at his 8 mercy during every
etage ot the game, allowing but two
tcratch hits and passing no one to the
initial sack. Altrock wa.Â« also effective,
keeping the hits well scattered and allow
ing but one man to walk.
The only run of the game was made in
the third. Hanson singled and was ad
vanced to second on Moskiman's out to
tirst, scoring on Mohler's hard single to
left field. After that nothing was? doing.
The Dudes had several chances, but the
timely hit was lacking.
Hemphlli was hit on the head by a
pitched ball the first time he went to bat

STAKE HONORS
GO TO AEOLUS
G. Malcolm's Courser
Wins Open Plains
Event.
PETALUMA, Nov. 14.â 1n a hard-run
final that was prolific of many exciting
turns George Malcolm's fast young gre>
hound Aeolus captured first honors in the
open plains meeting to-day from D. J.
Healey's For Glory. The affair from the
betting end partook much of a settlement
of a factional difference. The home con
tingent had been playing Healey's dogs
against everything in the stake and pat
ronized For Glory to a heavy extent for
the last course. With all credit to that
clever little performer, she put up a granvl
exhibition, but in Malcolm's young won
der she met a hound a class above her.
Aeolus showed himself a topnotcher.
Even the backers of the Petaluma dog
acknowledged him the better hound.
When Aeolus beat Tom Hurlick, which
looked to have a great chance, he ran a
course that renewed the confidence of his
backers. For Glory beating St. Ivis
placed Malcolm's dog for a bye and
things looked brighter for the visitors.
The dogs went to the slips at about even
money. Aeolus took a lead of about four
lengths and because of the .hare's con-
Uiioed favor to For Glory was forced to
do his best in the work. As he began to
outpoint his opponent the cheering for
For Glory diminished and when he turned
the hare to her for the kill and ende-d
the course it ceased entirely. Aeolus' vic
tory in the first stake after the dtath of
his eir*>. For Freedom, is a fitting tribute
to the memory of that great greyhound.
A. J. Martin ran a great dog and was
figured to carry away the honors. Against
For Glory in the semi-finals, he stumbled
when he had the course won. but For
Glory pir-ked up the hare and gained the
decision.
The meeting was a success from, every
point. The day's results with Judge John
Grace's official scores follow:
Fifth roundâ A. J. Martin b^at Tiburon. 4-1;
Aeolu* beat Tom Hurlick, 4-2; For Glory beat
St. Ives. 5-3.

asked Deputy District Attorney Fitzpat
rick.
Slowly raising himself upon one arm
and looking straight at the face of George
he pointed a finger at him, saying:
"Him, himâ the little fellow; him with
da brown hat!''
Exhausted by the effort, he fell back,
and it wa.Â° some minutes before he recov
ered sufficiently to tell about the difficul
ties between his brother's family and his
own.
"It is all a matter of business troubles,"
he said to the interpreter. "When I
bought him out at the fruit store he
bought the saloon. Then he brought th^se
two boys here, and one month after thfy
came the little one tried to kill my wife
with a stiletto. Before the boys came
they wrote .a letter from Sicily, saying
they would kill their uncle; and see how
they have done it. I am dying! I am
dying!"
Michael Caldarrello is about 17 years of
age, and works for his father at the sa
loon at 245 Third street. On the prison
register he gave his age as 21 years and
his occupation as a bartender. He says
that not knowing Mackay was a po
lice officer, he not being in uniform, he
fired ore shot at him when he found the
crowd entering the saloon. He said he
expected' that it was some of his uncle's
friends, who were trying to assault him.
Oeorge. who is charged with two at
tempts to commit murder, says he is
studying the barber trade at a Howard
street "college," and attends night school
Although but a year i nthe country lie
has made rapid strides in English. He
rtooÃ m t hesitate '.o admit that it was the
family feud that caused him to attempt
to Blay; denies the story that his father
or any one else offered him $30 to shoot
his uncle.
The second charge of assault' to murder
against him is based on the shots he
took at Officer Mackay while the latter
was hunting for him in the saloon.
Allington J. Smith, a lodging-house
keeper at HIM; Minna street, was also ar
rested in connection with the affair. He
did not participate in the shooting, but
when he heard the firing, thinking it was
some labor trouble, with which affairs he
had experience during the strike, he
placed his pistol in his pocket and filled
another pocket with cartridges, but ran
away when he found that shooting was
going on. He was charged with carrying
a concealed weapon.

of Fitzsimmons.' He claims he is stronger, healthier,' faster and can hit
harder than ever before. As to the dream, in the early hours of yesterday
morning the champion awakened, and finding it too early to arise, dozed off
again and dreamed /ie was fighting Ruhlin and had beaten him in a round and
a half. When he told this to some of his Los Angeles friends a number of them
took the tip and went out and bet that Jeffries would win within five rounds Jim
says he dreams before every fight.- Before both his battles with Sharkey he
dreamed he was having an awful tussle with the marine and in both bauies his
dream was realized. He, dreamed also.that he had defeated Fitzsimmons and
again his dream came true. It now remains to be seen whether 'Jeffries' latest
fond dream will be realized. ;; Â¦...".. Â¦ . , -. ,
As stated in The Call a week ago, Jeffries always has a lucky cuff button in
his belt when he fights. This button is the property of Sam Thall, the theatri
cal manager. It was the rnascct of Corbett in all his fights but the one he had
with Fitzsimmons. Jeffries wore it in every battle he has had within the past
three years and he will wear it to-night. Thall went over to the training quar
ters yesterday and presented it to the champion. Jim laughingly received it and
gave it to his brother Jack with the admonition that he bring it to the Pavilion
so he could wear it in his belt. The cuff button is a simple one It is made out
of coin silver and has the initials of Sam Thall on it The monogram ' ST
is said to mean sure thing." . . . â¢ ' ?â¢â¢

LOOK OUT FOR NEW CHAMPION
BEFORE MIDNIGHT, SAYS RUHLIN
lAM ready for battle. During: my career I have never been in bet
ter physical condition than I am at present. I am faster, stronger
and more confident than ever. My experience will stand me in good
stead. I know Jeffries is a dangerous man, but he will find I aan his
master. I feel confident I can beat Jeffries because I subdued
Sharkey in less time than he could ever do. It is true Fitzsimmons de
feated me, but those who saw that battle will attest I gave the black
smith a beating he will not soon forget. I have looked forward to this
opportunity of meeting Jeffries and I will make the most of it. He will
find me vastly improved. There will be a new heavyweight champion
before midnight. I have had no dreams nor have I mascots. I simply
have my health and strength, and I am certain that with these I will
win. I cannot say how lam going to fight my opponent. His method
will lead me to adopt one to suit the occasion. GUS RUHLIX.
IF Billy Maddens prediction is not amiss there will be a new champion to
night. If Gus Ruhlin makes good his boast the husky boilermaker, who has
heretofore pummeled and buffeted his way through all the human ob
stacles in the shape of aspirants for heavyweight honors that threatened to
dim his star and put out his pugilistic light, will go down to defeat. If Gus
Ruhlin was ever destined to have the strength, ability or luck to beat Jeffries,
heavyweight champion of the world, he is certainly in better shape to do it to
night than ever before.
According to the statements of the physicians who have examined Ruhlin he
will enter the ring at the highest point of his physical powers. Constant training
and systematic methods have rounded Ruhlin into a counterpart of the Grecian
warrior of ancient days. So good is hi* present physical condition that he will
scarcely be able to attain the same perfection again.
During his pugilistic career Gus Ruhlin has had a complete ring experience.
He has fought his way into the championship class. During that time the
Akron idol has experienced overy emotloa that falls to the lot of prizefighters
from the exhilarating spirits of victory to bitter defeat.
Some figure that after a man has once been knocked out he is easier game to
defeat than he would be if the point of his jaw had never been a cushion for
the other man's best punch. There are other judges of the boxing game who
claim that a fighter who has been sent to the mat fcr a longer period than the
fatal ten seconds gets an experience that helps him wonderfully In future bat
tles, that Is if he is not one of the class of fighting men who go to pieces after
the first knockout. Ruhlin' s record shows he is not In the latter category. An
inspection of it also discloses the fact tthat Ruhlin fought his best battles with
men who had previously beaten him. The sturdy sailor put Gus away once In one
round and when Gus met Sharkey the second time he registered the first knock
out against the man who gave Jeffries two of the hardest battles he ever fought.
Ruhlin's performances show conclusively that he has profited by the several
rocks he has had in the cradle of fistic sleep. When he fought Fitzsimmons Ruh
lin showed a commendable cunning when in distress. If it comes to a point
where both Jeffries and Ruhlin fight themselves into dizzy atmosphere at th-=>
same time, on form the Akron giant should have a shade the better of it. That
condition is practically an unknown quantity to Jeffries, while Gus has often bee-i
called upon to fight his hard-pressing opponent and the overpowering sensation
of grrtgginess at the same time. When a, man gets a bit groggy his natural cun
ning becomes a factor in his chances for victory or defeat.
That is one time in the course of a prizefight when the mental powers of s
boxer are put to the test. Many a fighter has changed defeat into victory by
showing good judgment and common sense when the nerve centers of the brain
were deadened by a- punch. The champion has had none of this It is aulte c
feather in Jeffries' cap that he has not undergone the experience of havinir been
put to sleep in a bout, but as long as an opponent has ? pair of arms and an *v"
and brain to direct them there is a chanceâ no matter how remoteâ of his beine
knocked out or punched into the groggy state. If Ruhlin should get Jeffries i'
this condition it is not likely the latter would he able to protect himself as wei
as Ruhlin would under the same conditions. The correctness of this theory i<J
one of the rays of hope upon which tht.se who are backing the short end der>enri
Ruhlin made yesterday a day of absolute rest. He lounged around his train
ing quarters. Gus' usual good temper was ruffled by a drunken man who insisto.i
on pestering him. He caught the Akion giant's hand, and upon being welcome i
by Ruhltn. who, by the way, did not know him, proceeded to pull and maul hi i t}
around. Ruhlin became angry and when the man refused to desist he hit -it hi,,
but missed. Denver Ed Martin came to the rescue of Ruhlin's "pest ' ThiÂ«
proved unnecessary, for the stranger lost no time in getting out of range Ruhr ,

Dr. W. C. Eidenmuller, the ' Twentieth Century Club's physician accomnnniai

regulation ring was twenty-four feet.
The ring- to be used to-nipht was four feet
short, or twenty feet square. Some one
suggested to him that if he objected to
the smallness of the ring it might appear
his man was going to keep away from
Jeffries. He replied that the smaller the
ring the better he liked it. The Mar
quis of Queensberry rules do not stipu
late that a ring must be twenty-four feet
square. They read: "All contests to be
decided in a roped ring, not less than
twelve feet or more than twenty-four feec
equare."
The betting has been at a standstill for
several days. The prevailing odds are two
to one. That Jeffries has no fear as to the
outcome of the fight is evidenced by tbd
fact that he drew |2000 from the bank

EXPLOSION ADDS
TO FIRE HORROR
Many Miners Imprisoned
at Bottom of a Burn
ing Mine.
BLUEFIEKD, W. Va_, Nov. 14.â Five
dead bodies have been taken from the
Baby mine at Pocahontas, Va. Several
other persons are unaccounted for, an-i
twenty-five persons have been rescued
more or less severely hurt.
At 3 o'clock this morning it was dijÂ»
covered that the Baby mine of the Poca
hontas Company at Pocahontas, Va., was
on nre. In a short time after the liremen
reached the mine a terrific explosion oc
curred and many miners and their friendn
more or less Injured. It is supposed
that the mines caught nre from a defec
tive electric light wire. Five bodies had
been recovered up to t> p. m ., and it is
uncertain how many more are dead. It
is known that there are eight or ten men
still In the mines. They may succeed in
making their escape through the Tujj
River entrance. Twenty-five persona have
been rescued, all more or less burned,
some seriously and perhaps fatally. Tho
injured were carried to their homes in
wagons and the physicians in Pocahontas
were busy all day attending the injured.
One or two other explosions followed that
of the early morning. The mine ts still
burning and clouds of smoke are con
stantly Issuing from its mouth. The fan
has been stopped, and as soon as possible
to do so the mine will be re-entered with
the hope of extinguishing the fire.
In 1884 Pocahontas experienced a like
occurrence, in which over 100 lives were
lost.
The list of the dead 30 fax recovered la:

The sale of Felts' shoes, which has been going on for the past
three weeks, has been a remarkably success, but no more than it de-
serves. When shoes as elegant as Felts' are sold for half their for-
mer prices not many ladies are going to let the opportunity pass
without supplying themselves. Every day the little store has been
busy â the fitting chairs are most always filled. Here is the reason:
All of Felts' $6.00 to $8.00 shoes are being closed out for
$4.00, and his $400 and $5.00 values are to be had for $3.50.
Considering the elegance of the stock these prices are veritable
bargains that you can't afford to miss.
Look in the window at the shoes â you can readily see what
I values you are getting.
It is wise to buy while the stock is still complete in all sizes.
The sale is being held by the Walk-over Shoe Store, who
bought out Felts' with the intention of putting in a new line of
ladies' Walk-over shoes.
The Walk-over Shoe Store,
Felts' Successor,
924-926 Market Street.

LOUD'S WARNING.
CONGRESSMAN LOUD in an address to the
Richmond Improvement Club has drawn a
picture of San Francisco, past, present and
future. This city lost its position of control of the
whole coast when the overland roads were built, and
from that time until 1898 lived on the State of Cali
fornia. This may sound like a very unfavorable
statement. But where can be found another State
capable, out of its own resources, of building and so
long sustaining such a city as # this? What seems like
a statement not creditable to San Francisco is the
most creditable ascription to California that was ever
uttered. It is Mr. Loud's opinion that since 1898 we
have regained our trade reach in great part, but
that it can be held and made greater only by vigilance
and enterprise. In this sentence the Congressman
uttered that worldly wisdom which is the builder of
cities and States: "Let us remember that selfishness
is the controlling factor of a city's success. Humani
tarianism in that respect is beautiful only in theory.
If you have anything you don't want let another city
have that. We can compete with the jest of the
world only when we put ourselves on the same plane
as the rest of the world. I hope to see men of all
classes working together for the best interests of San
Francisco."
Good advice and well put. It was natural and in
evitable that this should cease to be the only dis
tributing point, but while there are, and will be,
others, this may remain the greatest. By the en
couragement of enterprise and investment and being
kind to both this city may always hold the same pri
macy on this coast that New York has on the other.
Mr. Loud commended the enterprise of Seattle,
and so do we, for it is American enterprise, and
wherever prosperity is every man in the Union shares
it, but San Francisco has no thrill of fear or jealousy
when Seattle is mentioned. That city will prosper,
but she will not outgrow this nor eclipse our star.
Now that Maryland Democrats are assured of a
majority of 14 on a joint ballot in the Legislature a
number of independent anti-machine Democrats are
organizing to bring about the defeat of Gorman for
the Senate. It is, however, not likely to amount to
much, for had the supporters of the movement had
any political sagacity they would have fought Gor
man at the polls instead of waiting until he had car
ried the State and then proceed to fight him in the
house of his friends.
A report comes from Paris that the epicures of
that city are alarmed over the falling off in the sup
ply of snails of a certain fine quality, and there is an
increasing fear that thÂ» delicacy will be lost to the
world. The suffering of the epicures from such fears
may be as genuine as any other sufiAÂ» ; gg, but it will
t.ot attract sympathy from tttj. <mt in this country.
We have troubles or our own.
As a Canadian optimist, boomer and jingo, Sir Wil
frid Laurier is entitled to first rank, for he has just
told the people of Montreal in a public speech that
Canada will not again ask for reciprocity with thii
country, but that in a short time Washington willl bo
sending diplomats to Ottawa to ask reciprocity with
Canada.
It is announced that there has been started among
the actors of New York a movement to obtain in that
city the social rank and recognition which the profes
sion enjoys in Europe, so it appears the elevation of
the stage is about to be undertaken through the me
dium of pink teas.
A New York town which until very recently gave
no reasonable excuse for being on the map is now
boasting that it is the happy possessor of the hottest
young lady on record. Her temperature has regis
tered 108 degrees every day for two years.
OPERA AND RING- FIGHTS.
SAN FRANCISCO at this time illustrates two
tendencies that seem opposed to each other at
every point. We are in our annual season of
grand opera. The works of the great lyric composers
are being rendered in style equal to that of any
metropolis in the world, and their interpretation is
by artists that are not outranked on any lyric stage.
The repertoire includes such a variety of subjects and
illustrates so completely what may be called the va
rious schools of music that our public has the oppor
tunity to study them snd catch the thrill and inspira
tion that had being in the tuneful souls of the great
men who created these lasting pleasures for the en
tertainment and refinement of the world.
In "Carmen," "Tannhauser," "Die Walkure,"
"Faust," "Manon," "La Boheme," "Romeo et
Juliette," "Figaro," "La Traviata," "Lohengrin" and
their companion works every chord of the human
heart is touched and returns its sympathetic thrill.
The voice of music is uttered in every tone, from
light to somber, and every human passion is ex
pressed in that universal language. It is art of the
first order, and whatever educating function it has is
in action for the benefit of our people. The audiences
may be present from motives as great in variety as
the music to which they listen, but among them are
not many of the lower and baser. As they go forth,
with spirits raised by the harmony of sound, it is safe
to say that it is not to be worse than when they en
tered the temple of the "Heavenly Maid." They have
been subjected to an influence that reaches in un
broken line back to the first man who blew into a
reed and made a new sound that was the beginning
of music. They have been under the spell of an art
that is nearly as old as prayer among the manifesta
tions of man's religious instincts. They have greeted
that which is so pure in spirit that even vice, ready
to use and debase the arts to her purpose, has found
this too virgin to serve her. ,
No man nor woman nor child has been made worse
or coarser, and from n>any a heart burdens have been
lifted, by the ineffable hand of harmony.
It is known in the history of music that men have
been turned from intended wrong by its ministra
tions. A cadence has touched a slumbering chord of
goodness and its vibrations have turned the soul
again to a concordance with virtue and gentleness.
These queens of song and masters of melody are
preachers, every one, and they utter great sermons.
All this illustrates one tendency. Critics and cynics
may have their say about it. They niay declare that
the audiences show forth the vanity of fashion, and
that pride and selfishness deck them to set and be
seen. But if this be admitted only the lighter dross
that is in human nature has been impeached.
The other tendency leads one to a different scene.
A greater audience than any at the opera will meet
to applaud a prize-fight. On Saturday night a
daughter of California will give to her people the
benediction of art at the opera-house, and a son of
California will fight to-night in the ring at the Pa
vilion. What nights of contrasts and contradictions!
Seats at the Pavilion will command higher prices
than boxes at the opera, and it will not be an "off
night" â every seat will be filled. The audience has
been arriving for a week, from New Orleans and
New York and far Boston. Perhaps not twenty
people have come to the opera from Oakland, with
only the bay to cross. The people who will be in
town that night from Stockton, Sacramento, Los An
geles and Fresno will be at the Pavilion, not at the
Opera-house. They do not come to be moved by a
concord of sweet sounds, but to see one prize
fighter knock out another. They do not applaud
tone and pitch, but uppercuts and blows well landed
on the "kisser," "smeller" or "lamps" of the unfor
tunate victim, and the height of their enthusiasm will
be reached when a thump on the solar plexus lays
him low with a dull thud and he quivers as if life were
trying to tear loose from the fleshy fiber while the
referee counts the number of seconds given him to
rise and fight on or lie unconscious while the belt
and the world's championship and glory of the ring
go to another. The bets made involve a sum that
Patti might envy, and the money will change hands
and much be thrown at birds of a feather with the
winners.
So art and brute force hold high carnival in the
same city, encouraged by the same community. One
lifts up, the other throws down. One refines, the
other coarsens. If we cavil because pride and vanity
may be in plumes at the Opera-house, what are we to
say if disorder and violence are in evidence at the
Pavilion?
Pride and vanity get no impulse from the notes of
California's lark. What will violence and disorder get
from the right and left handers of California's gladi
ator?
While Uncle Sam is considering how he can best
lighten the burdens of taxation upon his people so as
to get rid of the surplus in the treasury John Bull
is devising ways and means of increasing taxation so
that he can meet his expenditures without running
into debt. Such being the situation, it is probable
there will be a considerable shifting of population and
of capital from John Bull's country to that of Uncle
Sam within the next few years.
NO TARIFF TINKERING.
DESPITE the persistent talk of tariff revision
at the coming session of Congress it now ap
pears well assured that nothing of the sort
will be done. Mr. Babcock and his friends may make
the attempt and the low tariff men and free-traders
may give them strong support, but it will be ineffec
tive in face of the popular objection to any change in
the fiscal system under which the country has pros
pered and the strong opposition which will be made
by the Republican majority in both houses.
Well informed Washington correspondents who
have noted the arrival of various persons to confer
with the President upon reciprocity or tariff reduc
tion, and have carefully inquired as to the results of
juch conferences, are agreed that at present at least
the outlock promises nothing for the tariff revision
ists. It is said the President has given no indication
of what he will do on the subject, but the opinion
of those who have talked with him is that he will
content himself with directing attention to the con
stantly growing surplus and leave Congress free to
determine what measures shall be adopted to reduce
the annual revenue.
Republican leaders who are recognized as authori
ties in fiscal matters are well nigh unanimous in op
position to any tariff tinkering this winter. Senators
Aldrich and Allison have frankly and emphatically
declared themselves against reopening the tariff
question, whether in the guise of reciprocity treaties
or under the general proposition of a readjustment of
schedules. Such leaders of the House as Payne,
Dalzell, Hopkins, Grosvenor, Steele md Russell
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NQVEMBER 15, 1901.*
have had talks with the President and are agreed that
the tariff shall not be made once more an issue of
party politics, to the disturbance of the industries of
the country, so far as they can prevent it.
From these reports it seems clear that whatever
changes may be made for the purpos# of reducing
the revenue -will be in the internal taxes, and par
ticularly in what are known as the war revenue
taxes. The liquor men, the brewers and the
tobacco men are all eagerly working for some reduc
tion in the taxes upon their products. Most of those
who are opposed to tinkering with the tariff are
quite willing to cut down the war taxes, and their
views will be supported by the public generally.
It must not be supposed, however, that the free
traders and their allies of various kinds are not going
to make a hard fight. The Democratic leaders who
have been looking for an issue to take the place of
the free silver question will gladly give every assist
ance they can to any movement that is made toward
tariff revision. The revival of a tariff fight would
help them to get rid of Bryanism, and, while it would
be but a forlorn hope in any contest before the peo
ple, it will be decidedly better than no hope at all.
The outlook for the session, therefore, is that there
will be no tariff tinkering nor the adoption of any
reciprocity treaty, but that there will be a good deal
of discussion on the subject and a persistent effort
made to bring it before the country as an issue in the
elections of next fall.
A company of Philadelphia capitalists, among
whom are the Cramps, are about to establish a plant
for the manufacture of a new rifle which they claim
will revolutionize war. It is said the gun at each
pressure of the trigger fires five shots through a
single barrel, ejects the cartridges and reloads the
weapon, and all without any recoil. A few more such
improvements in weapons and old man War will
nave to go way back and sit down.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
SHIPPING statistics made public in the report
of Mr. Chamberlain, Commissioner of Naviga
tion, afford another strong argument in sup
port of legislation designed to promote the upbuild
ing of our deep sea merchant marine. The fiscal
year covered by the report of the Commissioner was
on the whole one of notable progress in American
ship-building, and yet the progress was almost wholly
in the construction of ships for our coastwise and
lake trade. Upon the ocean the showing made by
our ships during the year, so far from being encour
aging, was distinctly the reverse.
According to the summary of the report that has
been made public the figures of shipping for 1891
compared with 1861 show an increase in coasting
trade vessels from 2,704,544 tons to 4,582,683 tons
(two-thirds of this increase being on the Great
Lakes), a decrease in foreign trade vessels from
2,496,894 tons to 879,595 tons, and a decrease in
whaling and fishing vessels from 338,375 tons to 61,
940 tons. Of the total tonnage 3,623,201 tons are
wooden vessels, and only 1,901,017 tons are iron or
steel. In 1900 Great Britain launched 1,440,000 tons
of steel vessels.
Our foreign trade is augmenting and expanding,
while the carrying trade remains in the hands of
other nations, and the consequence is that in the
year under review American vessels carried only a
little more than 8 per cent of our exports and im
ports, the smallest percentage in the history of the
country. Our fleet of ocean steamers is utterly in
adequate to our needs and is too small to be com
pared with that of any first-class foreign power.
One of the main reasons for the inability of Ameri
can ocean vessels to compete with those of foreign
countries is the difference in the rate of wages. As
an illustration of that difference the Commissioner
points out that the payroll (excluding the master) of
380 men on the St. Louis is $11,300; of 427 men on
the British Oceanic is $9900, and of 500 men on the
German Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse $7715.
In addition to cheaper labor the foreign ship
owner has the advantage of liberal subsidies. Against
such odds American ship builders and owners would
vainly try to compete. The results are shown in the
statements of the Commissioner. Foreign shipping
in the Pacific trade has doubled during the last three
years, and is increasing everywhere, while of our own
shipping the showing is made that the American flag
was seen much oftener on the North Atlantic during
President Jefferson's embargo (1808) or during the
cruises of the Alabama than at present.
Such is the showing of the official statistics. It
would appear that nothing more could be required
to convince intelligent men of the need of taking ac
tion to promote our industries upon the sea even as
we promote those upon land. The Republican party
has repeatedly pledged itself to enact legislation for
th% purpose of upbuilding our merchant marine, and
it is high time the pledge were fulfilled.
Chairman Payne snd Representatives Grosvenor,
Steel and Russell of the Ways and Means Committee
are reported to have had a conference and decided
that there is at this time no need of tariff revision
nor of reciprocity treaties, and it is safe to say that a
majority of the American people agree with them.
We are so prosperous just now we can afford to let
well enough alone.
Many tales are told of Boston women which in
cline the frivolous to scoff, but even the gravest and
most reverent will be tempted to smile at the an
nouncement that one of the ladies of the Boston So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals re
cently protested against boiling or roasting chest
nuts because the process puts to a cruel death many
an innocent worm.
There is a report that Cresceus, the star trotter, is
to be exhibited on the vaudeville stage this winter,
and should it be done there would be no great sur
prise. In fact, the time may yet come when some
enterprising vaudeville manager will undertake to
swing a President of the United States round the cir
cuit.
Out of her pride in the Pan-American exposition
and her sorrow that it proved a financial failure, Buf
falo has about reached the conclusion that Congress
should appropriate money to make up the deficiency.
The finally revised figures of the census of 1900
show that we have in this country something more
than 16.300,000 men of militia age, so now if any na
tion is spoiling for a fight let her come on.
It looks now as if Mr. Addicks' Senatorial boom
had vanished like a busted gas plant and that the
Delaware deadlock would be opened next time with
out any trouble whatever.
It will be noted that Bryan's activity in lowa and
Nebraska has had the usual result. Perhaps the gen
tleman will now go way back and sit down.
FIRST WOMAN AT NOME APPEARS
IN THE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
MRS. REQUA, the first white
woman to reach Nome, has
made an entrance into the cele
brated Alaska contempt case.
She was called by the respond â¢
ents, and for two hours told a story that
is full of human Interest and replete witn
tales of futile efforts wasted in the ico
fields.
Like many of the other witnesses who
have preceded her, Mrs. Requa has more
than a peck of troubles. While her testi
mony is not particularly vital or directly
material to the issues it may give a hard
knock to the credibility of W. T. Hume.
Mrs. Requa had a merry time with that
attorney and many others. "Selecting an
attorney in Nome is like buying a pig ir.
a poke," she said. Some of her judg
ments on lawyers and Nome methods
made food for thought. She learned her
lesson by experience.
None of the lawyers present doubted the
bravery of Mrs. Requa, and they all paid
respect to her bright, clear-thinking mind.
In 1898 she and her uncle, an old man,
went to Alaska to dredge the Yukon, but
hearing of the strike of gold in the Nome
district Mrs. Requa set out from the Ta
nana for the new El Dorado. With a
party of seven she walked a distance of
700 miles over ti:e ice. Instead of her trou
bles ending here, they really began.
Mrs. Requa's prospecting companions
were Tom Jacobs and Jack Glover. To
gether they located claims on the Dexter.
Mrs. Requa Locates Claims.
"What indications did you find of loca
tions on this creek?" asked Attorney
' Heney, who conducted the examination.
"Sometimes a willow twig with a loca
tion notise; sometimes nothing but the
twig itself," responded the witness.
"Did you make any locations?"

coal for the round trip, thereby saving the
cost of coaling stations, also one having
the capacity to carry large cargoes and a

placing upper and lower and four corner

Later it transpired that Jake Linder
berg claimed that Lindbom had located it
for him in November, 1898. Mrs. Requa
had ateo staked No. 4 below, on Anvil.
This claim the witness staked on the
ground of sentimentâ for John A. Dexter,
who kept a roadhouse and who was suf
fering from paralysis.
"They wanted that stake," she said.
"Harry Campbell and another man cam.-
to me in my tent and told me that unless
I filed an abandonment they would set
me outside of Anvil City. Campbell said
the boys had sent him there, and hinted
that they could shoot straight. After
ward he told me it was a joke; but I
guess I'm not a good judge of jokes."
In telling how the Laplanders stake
Mrs. Requa said: "I tried to stake a claim
but could never get ahead of the rein
deer."
Mrs. Requa had something to say about
the missionaries, who, according to her
testimony, were too busy staking claim*
to afford comfort or solace to the af
House of Representatives in the Capitol
of the United States, which is set apart,
or so much thereof as may be necessary,
as a national statuary hall for the pur
pose herein indicated.

find in this city a full list of the statue*
therein, but such may be had by writing
to the chief of engineers of public build

placing statues in the hall.

Then came the struggle at law and with
the attorneys. Hume was Mrs. Requa's
attorney, and her story is a long tale cf
duplicity on his part and an attempt of
attorneys to juggle her out of her claim
interests. Records were changed, mining
properties transferred into specious atoc'v.

abused in regard to her mining interests.

BANK ACCOUNT
PROVES A MYTH
Hatter Korn Asks Police
to Apprehend S.
C. Pardee..
Former Oakland Society Star
Issues More Bogus
Checks.
S. C. Pardee, formerly attorney for the
Fidelity and Casualty Company in this
city and a shining light in Oakland's ex
clusive society until the Oakland trades
men that objected to cashing checks of
a purely autographic value made the city
of churches too warm for him, is once
more in town and again exchanging
worthless paper for coin of the realm.
Eugene Korn, the hatter at 726 Market
street, yesterday turned over to Captain
of Detectives Seymour Pardee' s dishon
ored check for $25. Korn is out a hat and
$14 60. The police are looking for Pardee.
Pardee has been a customer of Korn's
for some time. Pardee's check record was
unknown to the hatter, and when a few
days ago the insurance man dropped in,
bought a hat, Bpoke about wanting a lit
tle change, wrote a check for $20, pay
able to self, on the Anglo-California
Bank, indorsed the paper and carelessly
threw it on Korn's counter, the man that
Belle hats hastened to oblige his genial
patron by counting out the change.
The check was returned with a Dig "No
funds" stamped across its face. Korn
did a little Investigating, and in spite of
the fact that Pardee was such a nice,
well-mannered gentleman and an old cus
tomer decided that probably the Police
Department could assist him in recover
ing at any rate his change.
Although no other cases have been re
ported to the police, it is pretty certain
that Korn was not the only victim, as
Pardee has always been Impartial when
in the mood for distributing his auto
gTaphic orders on imaginary bank ac
counts.
When In Oakland Pardee was a member
of the Athenian Club and cut a wide
ewath in across-the-bay society. His
careless distribution of checks, however,
brought him into disrepute and he was
obliged to leave the town. Charles
Scharff, proprietor of the Maison de
l'Opera, was one of his Oakland victims.
Pardee's next public appearance was
about a montn ago, when he was arrested
in Stockton for passing a worthless check
for $50. He made good the amount and
avoided proeecution. He has returned to
San FTancisco, and as he is an industri
ous j-oung man the police expect to find
his trail well littered with his paper or
ders.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1901.
O'CONNOR HAS A CHANGE OF LUCK,
REACHING THE WIRE ON TWO WINNERS
Four Favorites Meet With Defeat at Oakland â Glendenning Runs
Away From His Company â John McGurk No Match for Liz
zella â Princess Titania Takes the Closing Event at Good Odds
SOME few of Jockey Winnie O'Con
nor's friends have been unkind
enough to say that his spell of
ennui that kept him from landing
a winner for the past few days at
Oakland was due to the fact that he has
been deeply absorbed studying the part
of the melancholy Dane, and will shortly
give a new version of "Hamlet." At any
rate, Winnie ceased study long enough
yesterday to give two excellent exhibi
tions of horsemanship, getting past the
judges first astride LJzzella at a to 1 and
later leading a field out on Billy Moore,
a 5 to 2 second choice, each ride earning
for him the plaudits of the assembled
crowd. The track was good but not fast,
and four more favorites were topple!
over. While the bookies may have ha 1
i the better of the argument" none of the
', winning horses were entirely overlooked.
/ Practically a newcomer, Walter Jen
nings annexed the opening purse, a sprint
for maiden two-year-olds, with Jacque
minot, a rilly by Uarebin. It was the
stable's second start at the meeting ana
the ring laid 8 to 1 about the young misa.
She led throughout under Birkeuruth's
handling, and >n a drive downed Cathello
a head. The Morris entry, Rameses, ruled
a hot favorite, and shouia be relegated '.o
j the transfer wagon service.
A little luck at the post helped Scally
wag to the second purse. Dell Foun-
I tain's sprinter looked best on paper, but
Phe is none too game, and for that reason
' the ring laid 5 to 2 aDout him. Breaking
i off in front, Ransch led him tiptoeing the
entire route. He lasted just long enougn
to beat Mrs. Brunell a neck. Johnny
Woods rode a perteet race on the latter
Parsifal, a well played one, ran third.
Some few of the upper class students
referring back 10 "page 32, third line from
the bottom," figured that Glendenning's
| race with Cruzados may have hurt the
St. Carlo gelding. For that reason 1 to 1
was laid against his taking the six-fm
long run for two-year-olds. He went out
with Jimmy Logue and won further than
a parlor rifle will carry, with Commis
j sioner Forster a distant second and Quad
ra a tifed third. '
For those who couldn't stand for the
work of John McGurk there was 3 to 1
against the old mare Lizzella in the bet
ting on the mile and a quarter selling re
cital. John had twelve pounds off and the
pleasure of being installed an even money
I favorite. If he had had two dozen pound;
I off and ran in his stocking feet he coull
not have attached himself to first money.
O'Connor on Lizzella flattered him with
the lead for a mile and then gradually
left the first choice behind, winning at
leisure Free Lance, from Harry Stover s
stable, pre-empted third money.
Mortgage, from the Burns & Water
house string, bitterly disappointed her
friends by the showing she made in the
mile selling event. A 3 to 2 favorite the
mare displayed some speed for three fur
longs and then gradually fell out of the
running. When it looked down the
stretch as if The Singer would win hands
down, O'Connor made a brisk move with
' Billy Moore, and assuming the lead, beat
! the Magrane entry out three lengths
: Senator Matts, a 60 to 1 shot, finished
Trainer-Cashier Johnny Mellin of the
Caesar Young stable spread a bundle of
strange money about the ring on Princess
I Titania to win the final dash. Hoar had
i the leg up and after making all the pace
the Princess was running- away at the
wire a length in front of Narra G. J. T.
Woods, whose head is as devoid of brain
matter as a punctured bicycle tire is of
wln.l, rode a nonsensical race on Cousin
| Carrie, finishing in the show.
Track Notes.
Lou Houseman and "Sandy" Griswold.
j two well-known Middle Western news
| paper men, here to do "the big scrap,"
viewed the racing yesterday.
Blrkenmth is rapidly becoming a popu
lar rider with the public. He is quick to
take advantage of an opening and is in
: big demand with owners. â¢
In answer to their cablegram, the of
ficials of the track across the bay received
: an answer from the French racing au
thorites yesterday saying that "Boots"
Durnell had been ruled off the turf.
Charles Boots, the San Jose horseman,
was at the track yesterday for the first
time since the peculiar accident, when a
net deer nearly gored him to death. Mr.
Boots is rapidly recovering and was
warmly congratulated by his many
friends.
Henry Spencer, the well-known rider,
arrived on last evening's overland. He
was accompanied on the trip from New
York by "Joe" Scherrer, also a rider of
note before becoming to heavy. Spencer
pays he can ride at 112 pounds and will be
in the saddle in about a week. He is un
der contract to the firm of Burns &
Waterhouse.

BERKELEY FOLK
WIN A VICTORY
Half-Hour Trains Will
. Be Run, Beginning
on Monday.
The twelve years' struggle of the rest
dents of Berkeley and vicinity for a half
hour train service was ended yesterday
when the Southern Pacific Company is
sued an order granting the service and
making it effective on Monday next.
Notices were placed at the ferry and
on all Berkeley trains last night announc
ing the new service, and notifying Lhe
public that the new time card would be
U.sued no later than Sunday. The change
means simply the addition of half-hour
trains between 10 a. m. and 3 p. m. and
a special express flier in addition to the
regular local train connecting with the
5:30 p. m. boat from San Francisco. This
train will run through from the Oakland
mole to Lorin without a stop, and after
that point has been reached the custo
mary stops will be made at Ashby,
Dwight Way, Berkeley and Berryman.
The necessity for additional transporta
tion facilities to accommodate the Berke
ley traffic on the 5:30 p. m. boat has long
been apparent. Ten and twelve cars were
required, and even then dozens of travel
ers were unable to secure seats. Two
engines are employed to haul this and

The loss of time, especially in wet weath
er, has often been a source of complaint,
and it was to remedy this that the com
pany decided to put on the extra express
train. This will relieve the pressure
caused by congested traffic at a time
when it is most needed, and at the same
time greatly improve the service for the
residents along the Berkeley route.
The lack of half-hour trains to and from
Berkeley proved a source of annoyance
to the residents of the university town
for many years. People who chanced to
miss the hourly trains werÂ° compelled to
wait an hour or take the electric car for
Oakland and make the half-hour train at
Broadway. Numerous meetings of cftl
zer.s were held, at which memorials ad
dressed to the Southern Pacific were
drawn and presented to the great corpor
ation. The matter was repeatedly brought
to the attention of the late Collis P. Hunt

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â Professional specula,
tors were much disappointed over the effect of
last, night's official announcement of the terms
<: the settlement of the railway controversy
In the North That does not mean neces
t-tLrily thai the settlement does not insure all [
the benefits claimed for it. The speculators i
Â¦were bound to sell - stocks upon the definite !
announcement in any event. Their disappoint- \
ment to-day was' due to the fact that a very
light outside demand lor Mocks was attracted
by the announcement. The watchful bears
were keenly alive to the situation and when
they saw the efforts me king to realize profits
they put out extensive short lines to take away
the market tram those seeking to liquidate
and then fiercely raided the market to dislodge
Hop-loss order* and enable them to take profits
pa the khori Bide. How large an element the
thort celling was in the weakness of the mar
ket was disclosed when the bears began to
cover during the last hoi*. Substantial re
coveries were ide in all the active stocks
Â«nd at some points among the coalers and the
rj>eclaltie* there were complete recoveries. A
nutablÂ« fact in the day's trading was the com
parative Immobility of the United States Etfeel
stocks. The Â¦ transcontinental railroad stocks
Â»nd come.of the A'anderbilti. which have been
under manipulation recently for advances, were
most affected by the Belling, although the list
developed weakness throughout during the
Â«-oui-se of the day. The recent speculation haÂ«
been largely based ui>on the. Northern Pacific
wttlement and the well-known professionals
argue that' ihe best' news was net while the
disquieting condition in the money market
made it undesirable to hold stocks. . Some of
the recent price level*, taken in connection
with the' terms' of the Northern Securities Com
jiany organization, make it evident that those
'terms sre a disappointment In buyer* at the
prices indicated. . There was a \ dubious feel
ing- also as to how the -transcontinentals not
immediately concerned' in the settlement are
to benefit by it. ..The further, adjournment â¢ of
th* Burlington-, directors -was made by th.->
bear* to play upon the fears of- timid dealers.
The nicoo market v:j linn to- day, both for
call and time loans, the latter showing the
effect of the gold outiro for the first time. It
is expected that further gold will exported
on Saturday, although the easier tendency of
money in Paris and the reduction in the buy
ing price of gold in London served to advance
the level of exchange here at which gold ex- j
ports are profitable. The statement of the
country's foreign trade published to-day throws
some light upon the present anomalies of the
exchange situation. It is true that the total
-f October exports, although nearly $18,000,000
Â¦e'.mv those of last October, are the largest
or any other October in the country's history,
-v that in spite of the 'decrease, compared with
Â¦' her of last year, the notable trade balances
n our favor still remains $64,228,601. But re
rt events show clearly that exchange bills
Â¦ere sold in this market lons since in an
icipatlon of the autumn supply of bills to
oe brought upon the market by our export
trade and in process of borrowing foreign cap
ital. This constitutes a short interest in the
exchange market and the fact that the October
trade balance in our favor Is $28,530,045 less
than that of October of last year may furnish
an index of how far the banks were out In
their calculations when they were selling ex
change short.
The bond market was weak in synipathy with
stocks. Total sales, par value, $5,691,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

NEW YORK, . Nov. 14.â The Commercial Ad
vertisers flanancial cablegram says:
Business on the Stock Exchange did not Im
prove to-day and the tone was less cheerful
than yesterday. There is some tlk of gold ex
ports tc South America, but the bank return
was favorable
American stocks were regarded with particu
lar favor, the Northern Pacific settlement hav
ing been fully discounted and being counter
balanced by "New York gold export?, and
closed at the worst, Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific alone showing strength. There was no
borrowing en the part of either the bank or the
market, but the market is in full bank control,
which is likely to continue for the remainder
of the year. The bank returns show that the
institution is hugging- the consoling installment
of Â£3.000.000. Silver is dropping on New York's
continued sales.

here yesterday, and though Northwest receipts
were heavy again December opened >a@%c

sort became pronounced, and prices rapidly

fairly good, but secondary to the influence of
the coarser grains. When big primary receipts
were reported and corn quiet wheat longs took
to liquidating, and depressed the market,
which closed only barely firm %@%c higher, at
Corn was very Btrong early on better cables

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool futures were higher and
the foreign markets were generally steady to
firm. Argentine cables reported the weather
unfavorable for crops.
Chicago was strong and active at the open
ing, and the cash demand was a bullish feat
ure. Good investment buying and broadening
speculation made the market look higher. The
condition of the growing grain was good, but
more general rains will be needed before hard
freezing. Speculators show more confidence in
Wheat, as it Is relatively lower than Corn
and Oats. Commission houses were heavy
buyers of. December. Toward the close of the
session a weaker New York stock market
caused selling, and the market shaded off
somewhat, with Cudahy's brokers selling.
This market was steady, but not materially
changed.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The firmness in Potatoes continues, and the
tendency in prices Is still upward. Onions are
in light receipt and very firm, as the remark
ably heavy buying a couple of months ago
well-nigh cleaned up local stocks, and the few
left in growers' hands are closely held.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Dealers continue to shade quotations on But
ter to keep stocks down as far as possible. The
feeling is very weak.
No change is reported in Cheese, the market
being amply suppled, but steady.
Eggs are selling at previous prices. The de-<
'mand is not as active, as already mentioned,
owing to tho h!gtÂ» prices. Occasional sales are
made over the quotations. The spot supply is
rather larger, if anything, and one or two
houses say that they now find some difficulty
in moving the goods.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Large Berries came in late and most of them
went to the canners. Huckleberries were
tcarce, only 23 boxes arriving.
Grapes were heavy, the local demand contin
uing slack. There was a good demand for ship
ping and sound fresh stock in crates cleaned
up well, but there was so much carried-over
stock that the market as a whole was dull.
Large boxes still dragged.
A decline in Tangerines was the only change
in Citrus fruits, which were quiet.
Apples and Pears have not changed for some
time.

Weakness Upon the Sea

Foreign Markets Necessary
to T^ke Our Surplus
Products.
ATLANTA. Ga.. Nov. 14.â fifth an
nual session of the Southern Cotton Spin
ners' Association convened here to-day^
Dr. D. P. McAden, president, in his an
nual address recommended a declaration
by the spinners in favor of a merchant
marine 'upon a basis that will give all
American citizens an equal chance, pro
vent favoritism and recognize the produc
ing classes in the reduction of freight
rates."
He also favored the building, as soon
as possible, of the isthmian canal. On re
ciprocity Dr. M Aden said:
"The immense balance of trade in our
favor creates the necessity of our finding
a. market for our surplus products. We
should do all we can to advance both the
letter and the spirit of reciprocity. We
especially desire closer commercial rela
tions with South America and the Ori
ent."
At a smoker in the Kimball House this
evening Hon. Joseph Smith of Atlanta
spoke on "Development of Our Talent."
and Senator John McLaurin on "Exten
sion of Our Foreign Trade." Senator Me-
Lr.urin said:
We are at the dawning of a new day of
prosperity in the history of the ->:>rld when
all peoples will have a more perfect under
standing of the brotherhood of man and the
independence of nations. For 2000 years the
policies of the world have been conducted upon
the inhuman idea of shedding blood. This has
t-erved a useful purpose in the civilization of
mankind, awful as it h- to contemplate, but
that purpose has now been accomplished. Until
recently commerce was not deemed a proper
subject for governmental consideration. There
is no direct department of commerce in any
government except that cf Germany. The mov
ing considerations prompting the Chinese
troubles were commercialism. The time will
come when the best minds of every country
will be called upon to adjust the complications
and the questions of foreign trade, and the
consular officers at the leading ports of com
merce will equal in importance the diplomatic
Embassadors.
Our weakness upon the sea is the one great
danger that confronts the nation. If ships
could be built in the United States as cheaply
and operated under our flag a? cheaply as they
are under other flags it would be unnecessary
fnr our Government to do more than to offset
the subsidies, bounties, naval reserve, retainers
and ether methods by which foreign countries
attract capital into merchant ships built and
managed by their own people.
We tnuft not imagine that American capital
is dependent upon national legislation In order
to make shipewning pay. We have ample evi
dpnee of large American investments in for
cign-bullt ships, manned and operated by for
eigners in every foreign trade. However much
our people may have invested in foreign ships
they are unavailable under international law
when at war as naval auxiliaries.

Stomachs That
Won't Work,
That Betain the Food and Refuse to Digest |
It. Make the Held Heavy and the
NerveE Weak, Ncel Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
There is a cure for dyspepsia. Suffer-
ers ho have tried noxious nostrums will
probably by skeptical, but skepticism van-
ishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
tried. Whether the trouble is dyspepsia of
Jong standing, or merely a simple case of
indigestion, relief is prompt and pro- !
r.ounced. The less the trouble the fewer
tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eating, sour stomach,
as indicated by belchinp, fatigue with i
slight exertion or with no exertion at all; '
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues." these things can com- I
monly be set down as symptoms of dys- ;
pepsia. And dyspepsia is merely Indiges- |
tion in an aggravated form.
By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart's |
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves, :
restful refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy flesh. They make the !
pkin clear, the eyes bright, the mind j
cheerful.
Siuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a mcdi- I
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gest the food and make it easy of assimi-
lation and thfy relieve the inflamed, dis-
eased condition of the membranous lin-
inc.-= and the glands of the stomach and
bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places and put them into a j
healthy, active condition. They effect a |
quick and permanent cure. You don't !
have to continue taking them forever, still I
it is well to have a box handy and take
one at the first return of the trouble.
Perfectly well people are made sick by I
eating too much, or unwholesome food,
but not if they take a tablet after eating.
Treatment with Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets does not necessitate dieting or any
change of habits. They digest the proper
food and act upon the other kind in such a Â¦
W way as to make it pass off quickly and
harmlessly. You may eat and drink what
you like, when you like, and as much as
you like if you take a tablet afterward.

SAYS CHINATOWN SHOULD
BE DESTROYED AT ONCE
The annual report of Dr. Williamson,
chairman of the Board of Health, warÂ»
filed with Mayor Phelan yesterday. Thy
most important recommendation made in
the report is that for the destruction of
Chinatown. The report says:
Chinatown as it is at present cannot be ren
dered sanitary except by total obliteration. It
should be depopulated. Its buildings leveled by
fire and its tunnels and cellars laid bare; its
occupants should be colonized on some distant
portion of the peninsula, where every violation
of nary law could at once be detected. In
this way and no other will there be safety
from the invasion and propagation of Oriental
diseases. The day has passed when a prog
ressive city like San Francisco should feel com
pelled" to tolerate In its midst a foreign com
munity perpetuated in filth for the curiosity
of tourists, the cupidity of lawyers and, the
adoration of artists.

Pretty War-Time Romance Ends in Wedding of Miss Grace Grant
Grimes and Lieutenant Daniel D. Tompkins, Celebrated at
Noon Yesterday â Miss P. Dunn and H. Macfarlane Sail Away
MISS GRACE GRANT GRIMES
and Lieutenant Daniel D.
Tompkins were married yester
day at noon at the home of the
bride's father. Lieutenant Col
onel Grimes, at the Presidio.
The wedding of the young couple was
the closing chapter of a beautiful love
story, in which the hero, who had loved
the fair maid of his choice since the early
age of 12. finally wooed and won her. al
though he was then only a non-commis
sioned sergeant stationed at Havana and
the was hi= captain's daughter.
The arrangements for the wedding yes
terday were in keeping with the pretty
romance. In the drawing-room, whero
the ceremony was performed, marguer
ites (the class flower of the school from
which the young bride but recently grad
uated! and yellow chrysanthemumsâcom
plimentary to the c-HvaJry â were the only
flowers used in the effective decorations.
The corner of the room, where an altar
was erected, was decorated all in white.
The priedieu was covered in white; tho
pillows were of white satin and the young
couple knelt to receive the blessing of
Chaplain Brander of the Fifteenth Cav
alry, who performed the ceremony. The.
huge wreath of marguerites, which was
swung over their heads, looked like a
halo.
In the dining-room and hall red and yel
low, the colors of the artillery and cav
alry, were prettily mingled. In the hall
flowers helped to carry out the effect, but
in the dining-room only flags were used
for decoration.
Guidons and banners, that our brave
boys had followed through the Cuban war,
draped the walls, and overhead, forming
a canopy, were the flags of the artillery
and cavalry. There were neither brides
maids nor groomsmen. To the strains of
JUDGE J. G. SWINNERTON
ANSWERS THE FINAL CALL
Passing of the Stockton Jurist and
Orator the Result of General
Decline.
STOCKTON, Nov. 14.â J. G. Swinnerton,
well known throughout California as a
jurist and orator, died at his home in this
city at 8 o'clock this morning. His death
was due to general decline. He was 56
years of age.
Judge Swinnerton was born in Wiscon
sin and came to California in 1852, his
father being a pioneer. He was educated
in the University of the Pacific, and
taught school in San Jose for some time,
after which he entered the law office of
Bodley & Rankin. He was admitted to
the bar in IS7O. He lived in Eureka. Hum
boldt County, ten years, practicing his
profession there. Later he moved to
Stockton.
Judge Swinnerton married twice. James
Swinnerton. a newspaper artist, was an
issue of his first wife. The Judge wedded
Mrs. Bransford, daughter of Dr. Barnes
of I'kiah, in 1879 and she survives him.
He was a Mason, an Odd Fellow and a
Knight of Pythias. He leaves a consid
erable estate.
Judge Swinnerton, who was Judge of
the Superior Court of this county for a
term, was regarded as one of the ablest
lawyers in this State. He frequently ap
peared on the platform for the Republi
can party, and during his career deliv
ered many interesting lectures.

PERISH IN FIRE
AT THEIR CABIN
W. G. Giles and His Wife
Lose Their Lives in
Flames.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 14.
W. C. Giles, formerly superintendent of
the Oakland Water Company in this city,
and his wife were burned to death Tues
day night in a cabin near Cisco, where
they had been residing since Mr. Giles
took charge of William J. Dingee's mines
near that place. Meager details of the
distressing accident have been received
here by relatives of the unfortunate cou
ple. Arrangements have been made for
the shipment to Oakland of the remains.
So far as could be learned, Mr. and
Mrs. Giles had retired for the night and
had left a lighted lamp on a table near
their bed. The lamp was upset and the
burning oil ignited the floor and the flames
spread so quickly that neither of the cou
ple had a chance to escape. It is be
lieved they were rendered helpless by
suffocation from smoke. So quickly did
the fire run its deadly course that miners
living near the Giles cabin had not a
chance to attempt a rescue after they
had been aroused by the glare and crackle
of the flames.
As soon as the occupants of the burned
cabin could be reached life was practi
cally extinct. No physician was at hand
to assist or to render any relief and the
nearest place for such attendance to foe
had was at Cisco, fifteen miles distant,
and over a rough mountainous trail.
The fire also destroyed the mine store
house, located close to the Giles cabin.
Death came to both of the burned peo
ple soon after they had been removed
from tho ruins of their destroyed home.
The fatality has many circumstances of
peculiar sadness surrounding It. By the
death of Mr. and Mrs. Giles a little
daughter six years of age is left an or
phan. The parents had not taken her
with them into the mountains because of
tht rough surroundings and the fact that
during the winter time they would be
practically cut off from communication
because of snow.
The remains will arrive here to-morrow
in charge of Edward McQary, secretary
of the Contra Costa Water Company, an
old friend of the family, and of James
Richards of this city, a brother of Mrd.
Giles.
Mr. Giles had been handling the Dingee
mines for two years. He had resided In
Oakland for twelve years, most of that
time being in charge of the Oakland
Water Company before its consolidation
with the Contra Costa Company. Three
weeks ago Mr. Giles was in this city on
a business trip to purchase mining ma
chinery. He was preparing to Install a
quartz stamp mill on the property and
to develop what appears to be a rich pros
pect.
Mr. Giles was 45 years of age and a na
tive of England. The surviving daughter
has been residing with Mrs. M. Duffy,
Oakland avenue.
Lieutenant and Mrs. Tompkins left last
evening for Jefferson Barracks. On De
cember 15 they sail for the Philippines,
where the groom has been ordered.

It was just like the sailing away of a
newly wedded couple the departure yes
terday morning 1 for Honolulu of Miss
Polly Dunn and Harry Macfarlane Jr.,
who are to be married at Mr. Macfar
lane's island home on December 4.
The many friends of the young couple
went down to wish them a pleasant voy
age and they brought countless and beau
tiful bouquets for the fair young bride-to
be. The adieux were punctuated with
showers of rice. Miss Maye Colburn, who
is to be Miss Dunn's maid of honor,
sailed with her.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Dutton, brother-
in-law and sister of the bride-to-be, and
Miss Gertrude Dutton were to have ac
companied Miss Dunn on her trip, but
they were obliged to postpone their de
parture until November 22.

BIG GOLD DISCOVERY
IN THUNDER MOUNTAIN
Geological Expert Says the District Is
One of the Richest Ever
Opened.
BOISE, Idaho, Nov. 14.â According to
Professor E. A. Meade, the geological ex
pert, who has spent two weeks in the
Thunder Mountain district in Idaho in
vestigating for the Oregon Short Line
Railway the reports concerning the rich
ness of the gold deposits there, the dis
trict is one of the richest that has ever
been opened.
Professor Meade followed the main ore
body underground for 200 feet in one di
rection and for 245 feet in a general way
at right angles to the other. He could
find no ends, top or bottom to the body
Running through the main body is a vein
four feet thick of free milling ore that is
literally plastered with gold and which
will run into the thousands in value. Pro
fessor Meade said there appeared to be
a great reef of gold-bearing material run
ning through the country. The main body
of the ore, Thunder Mountain, according
to Professor Meade. will probably Tun a*
low in value an $7 to $10 a ton, but it is
In such immense riuantities that it can
literally be quarried out.
GOLD AND SILVER ORE
FOUND NEAR ALMADEN
Ledge Uncovered in a Mine Supposed
to Be Rich in Quick
silver.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 14.â Gold and silver ore
in paying quantities has been found a
few miles east of New Almaden, in a mine
owned by \V. H. Adams of this city. The
ledge will assay from $4 to $6 50 in gold
and from $3 to $6 in silver per ton.
R. B. Harper, a mining expert, has gone
to the mine, which was supposed to be
rich in quicksilver, to examine it for San
Francisco capitalists. A hanging wall to
a ledge had been encountered, and the
workmen were at a loss to know what it
was. On examination Harper found it
to be a blossom rock and decomposed
gosen, carrying iron sulphurets. He
brought some of it to the city and last
night made a crude assay, and found it
filled with native gold and silver.
BRIGADIER GENERAL HALL
GOES ON RETIRED LIST
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. â Brigadier
General Robert B. Hall will be placed on
the retired list of the army to-morrow by
the operation of the law on account of
age. With the retirement of General Hall
President Roosevelt will have an oppor
tunity to promote two officers of the
army to the grade of brigadier general.
The other vacancy was occasioned by the
retirement of Brigadier General Mefriam
yesterday. The list of candidates for
these two vacancies includes all the
colonels of the line, many lieutenant
colonels and many seniors of the line and
a large number of staff officers of the
rank of colonel, lieutenant colonel and
major.
Many of the candidates have had long
and distinguished service and are nearing
the age at which they must be on the re
tired list. Some of them served with dis
tinction during the war of the rebellion
and many of them held the rank of gen
eral officers in the volunteer establish
ment during and since the Spanish war.
REVOLVER DOES
NOT SCARE HER
Miss Ellis Brockaway
Robbed by Hooded
Footpad.
Oakland Young Lady Grants
Highwayman's Request
Not to Scream.
Oakland Office San Francisco Ca!l,
118 Broadway, Nov. 14.
While walking home at 11 o'clock to
njght from a class-meeting Miss ElliÂ»
Brockaway, a High School student, 17
years of age and residing at 767 Thir
teenth street, was held up by a masked
robber on Thirteenth street, between
Grove and Castro streets, and relieved of
a purse containing $10. The young lady
was mar-Â»elously cool throughout thÂ»j un
expected encounter, and during the mo
ment's colloquy with her hooded assailant
tried unavailingly to throw away her re r
icule. which sue was carrying in her
hand.
Miss Brockaway was walking briskly
down Thirteenth street and was half-way
across the block when she was suddenly
confronted by the footpad. His face was
concealed by a white handkerchief, whicn
was drawn tightly across his nose, hiding
his features below the eyes. A elouch
hat, drawn down upon his forehead, cov
ered the upper part of the footpad's face.
As he stepped out from behind a cluster
of trees tne masked highwayman, pistol
in hand, stoppe.l the young woman, com
manding, "Now, don't you scream, bui
give me your purse."
No Intention of Screaming.
"I have no intention of screaming."
coolly replied Miss Brockaway, maintain
ing her presence of mind, despite the
startling appearance of the robber.
Then she tried to fling the purse into
the grass plat at the sidewalk's edge. The
robber detected the movement of her arm
and grabbed her hand, snatching the
purse away. There was not another word
spoken by* either victim or robber. As
soon as the footpad got the purse he
slowly turned around and walked leisure
ly up the street, turning a corner and dls
aopearing in the darkness. Miss Brock
away waited until her disturber was out
of sight and then hastened to the police
station, where she reported the hold-up.
Takes Bag Out of Her Hand.
"Of course I was a trifle startled," she
said, "but there was not a bit of sense in
making a fuss, especially as the robber
had indicated that he might be compelled
to use a pistol if I made any outcry. He
must have been surprised himself when I
told him that T had no intention of do
ing any screaming. I thought that he
might be sufficiently distracted not to no
tice my attempt to throw away my purse,
but before I could get rid of it he had
taken the little leather bag out of my
hand. There were very few words spoken
between us, and it was all over in a mo
ment. After the footpad got away. I
thought the best thing to do was to tell
the police as quickly as possible. So in
stead of running right home I went to the
station."
Because of the darkness Miss Brockaway
had a poor view of the robber. He was
of medium size, and very quiet in his
manner and tone. The police are search
ing the city for the gentlemanly high
wayman.

HAWAIIANS WANT
CHINESE LABOR
Suggest Free Admission
of Mongolians to the
Is] an da.
Delegation Discusses Terri
torial Affairs With Seo
retary Gage.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â " W. O. Smith.
J. B. Atherton, F. M. Swansey and R. V.
Rithel, citizens of Hawaii, called on thÂ«
President to-day to diacusa with him thÂ«
condition of industrial affairs in the Ha
waiian Islands. They told the President
that Hawaii generally was opposed to
reciprocity arrangements between thÂ«
United States and Cuba, which would ad
mit sugar from that Island at a low cus
toms rate. The interests of Hawaiian* In
this respect, they declared, are identical
with those of ;he beet sugar growers of
the West and the cane sugar producer*
of the South, and they expect to join with
them if the. mutter should come to an is
sue during tha approaching session of
Congress.
The delegation subsequently called on
Secretary Gage and discussed with him
the labor situation in the Hawaiian Isl
ands. The sugar plantations, they toM
th,e Secretary, were becoming less pro
ductive each year because of the plant
ers' inability to secure desirable â¢ labor
The solution of the question, as the dele
gation viewed it, was the free admission
to the islands of Chinese, at least for a
time, as* they were the best laboi era
among all those who had been tried on
the sugar plantations.
Representative Long of Kansas, who is
a member of the Ways and Means Com
mittee of the House, was one of President "
Roosevelt's callers to-day. He joined with
his Eastern' colleagues on the committee i
in opposing a revision of the tariff. He . <
believes that any attempt to lower th Â¦
duties on particular schedules, such as
Babcock proposes, would lead inevitably .
to a general revision of the tariff, and
this, he says, his people do not favor. He '
says, however, that there Is a strong sen-, ,
t'.ment in his section in favor of reciproc
ity.

has been drowned in the inner entrance
to Humboldt Bay. His boat has come
ashore in a wrecked condition on the
north spit. It is supposed a strong tido
carried the boat over the bar. where ki
was overturned and its occupant drowned.
Spotts was last seen at Fields Landing
on Tuesday evening, whither he went to
get his mail. He left the landing at 5:1"
o'clock for his home on the south sptt,
where he has charge of the Government
reservation.
The missing man is about 50 years of

Government for many years.

a number of years a resident of this elty.

BANE DIVORCE CASE
COMES TO A CLOBZ
Court Takes Under Advisement Ac
tion in Which Wife Acted as
HeT Orra Counsel.
WILLOWS. Nov. 14.â The Bane drvore-i
case, which has been heard behind closed
doors in the Superior Court for several
days past, came to an Â£nd to-day and was
submitted to Judge Pirkey on briefs. P
D. Bane, the defendant, who is a brothe*"
of Rev. A. C. Bane of San Francisco, did
not intpoduce any evidence to contest hi^
wife's prayer for divorce, but he strenu
ously opposes her demand for a portion o:
his property. Sane claims that an agree
ment of separation signed by himself and
wife in 3597. by which he gave her certain
property, is a waiver of all her rights f>
any of his holdings, Bane testified that
he would be willing to give a monthly a'
lowance toward the support of his tw^
children. The wife's point is that a re
quest for her to ccme back and live wttn
him, made in 1900. abrogates the separa
tion agreement.
Judge Pirkey haÂ« taken the case under
advisement. During the proceedings Mrs.
Bane acted as her own attorney.

Ordered to Portland.
The British ship Scottish Lochs arrived
off port yesterday and Instead of coming
In was ordered to proceed to Portland by
the pilots. The Scottish Lochs came here
in ballast from Rio de Janeiro
to load wheat, but aa she was
wanted at Portland the agents were
instructed to keep a lookout for her.
Accordingly, when she showed up yester
day morning the pilot-boat Pathfinder ran
down to her and when she went in staya
a boat was lowered and a pilot went to
her with the message. It did not take
long for the Scottish Lochs to fill away
and in five minutes she and the Path
finder were a mile apart.
The Scottish Lochs comes all the way
from the Atlantic in search of a charter.
She has a good rate and should she get
quick dispatch on the Columbia River will
make a few abllars for her owners on the
venture.
Water Front Notes.
Harbor Commissioners Kilburn and
Herold made a tour of the front yester
day. Mr. Herold went north and Mr. Kil

of all the mooring piles and the chances
are that at the next meeting of the board
considerable work will be ordered done.
The new schooner E. B. Jackson was
launched at Grays Harbor yesterday. She
is a four-masted vessel and will prove a

TARIFF BEARS
ON CALIFORNIA
Australian Measure Puts
Tax on Products of
State.
Director Eugene Goodwin ?t the Pacific
Commercial Museum has received advices
of great importance to the commercial
community concerning the flV.st protective
tariff of the Australian federation. This
tariff has been approved by one branch
of the Australian Government, and al
ready under the Australian form of pro
cedure is in effect, although it has not
finally been adopted by the othsr branch.
At Newcastle, according to thÂ« advices,
the retail houses have added thS duty to
the price of goods and are reaping a large
profit on the goods that were in stork.
The tariff afreets many classes of prod
ucts and manufactures in which are in
cluded products of California, as wine
brandy, flour, wheat, almonds, barley'
malt, peas, biscuits, blankets, boots and
shoes, canned fruits, currants, furniture
fuse, gloves, honey, hops, onions, pota
toes, salmon, etc.
Fabrics, iron manufactures, and indeed
all branches of industry in the United
States are concerned in ,tne measures pro
posed and partially adopted. New South
Wales, which has been practicaily a free
trade colony^ is bitterly opposing the pro
tective tariff. On the whole, the tariff
rates have been raised even above those
that Victoria has had in force.
Cotton piece goods are charged 10 ncr
cent. Hats carry a duty of 10 shillings
per dozen and 15 per cent ad valorem
bottled ale and stout 4 shillings 8 pence
per case. Ten per cent is added to malt
of which Australia supplies only about
one-third of its consumption. The duty
on wheat is 6 pence per cental, equal to
nearly 11 pence per bushel, and 1 nence
per pound on flour gives, according to the
estimates of Australian millers, a protec
tion equal to Â£4 16s 8d per ton. A tabu
lation appears in the last number of the
Sydney Morning Herald to reach this
country, which shows the tariff of the
commonwealth as compared to the old
tariffs of the several colonies, Western
Australia being alone excepted because
in that colony the tariff that heretofore
was in force will under the constitution
be retained for a period.
Duties on California Products.
From the tabulation some figures are '
taken at random, indicating the frenera'
tenor of the whole, and having esDeci-i
reference to the products in wnlch Cali
fornia is particularly concerned. Tho
duties imposed in these instances are as
follows:
Almonds, 3d per pound; bacon. 3d pÂ«r pound
barley. 13 6d per cental; peas, Is 6d per cen "
tal; biscuit*, l^d per pound: brandy 14s r*r
gallon; currants, 2d per pound: flour, 2a 6d rÂ»-r '
cental; uloves 20 per cent; blankets. 2u per 'Â¦
cent; bottled, fruits, 3s uer dozen; bolts and '
nut?, 20 per cent; fruit, canfced, 3s per dozen '
lui-nlture. 20 per cent; honey. 2d per pound 1
hops, .6d per pound; onions, is pw 100 pounds :
paper baics. 7s 6d per 100 pounds; DOtattxs U i

pound; raw sugar, 6d per 100 pounds; tobacco i
manufactured. 3s 6d per pound; wheat is Bd I
per 100 pounds; wine, sparklns. 12s- wine !
other than sparkling;, Ss.
Within the past few days merchants
have been anxiously inquiring at the Pa
cific Commercial Museum concerniiv tho \
effect of the new tariff. The above fig
ures convey the first authentic informa
tion that is procurable on that interest
ing point. All the Australian colonies
are included in The commonwealth with
the exception of New Zealand. -For the
first time, with the exception of New-
Zealand, the colonies or States, as they
now are called, will have free trade with
one another. While the peonle of N^w
South Wales are protesting "and hoping
to change the tariff in some particulars
the free trade provision between the colo
nies is actually in force. Against New-
Zealand, however, the new tariff runs.
The effect will be that large quantities of
New Zealand produce will be shut out
from the commonwealth. The Wellington
(New Zealand) Post of recent issue says
"lf the tariff proposals are adopted New

the near future."
Machinery Is Taxed.
American agricultural machinery is
heavily taxed. Tea has to carry 20 per
cent ad valorem in addition to 2 pence
per pound. Those who are favoring the
final adoption of the tariff are urging
that it will tend to build up the manufac
turing industries of Australia, which has
coal, iron, lumber, wooT. etc.. at home
Some additional light is gained from an
editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald,
a part of which is as follows:
It ia complained that the tariff offers the
manufacturers of cement a practical bonus of
125 per cent over the imported article. Plas
ter of parts shows 100 per cent, structural steel
about 45 per cent, wire 33 1-3 per cent, horse
shoe nails 50 per cent more than the present
price. Those who buy medium grrade boots
must pay 3s 6d more than they have been
accustomed to and 2s 6d more for ladies' foot-
Kear. The consumer of kerosene must be pre
pared to meet a demand of 50 per cent more
than before, and the poorer buyer of hats will
find the cost raised from 60 to 120 per cent

SUPERVISORS IN FAVOR OF
RECOGNITION FOB BRAVERY
Urge Fire Commission to Reward
Frank Gorman for Rescuing
a Young Girl.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee yester
day referred to the Fire Commission thÂ«
communication of Chief Sullivan of the
Fire Department, recommending for suit
able recognition the heroic act of Frank
Gorman in saving Miss Nellie Healey
from a fire at 244 Stevenson street.
The committee recommends that Gor
man be rewarded in such manner as will
seem proper by the Fire Commission.
While appreciating the bravery shown by
Gorman in risking his life to save another,
the committee regrets that it has no
power to reward the young man. How
ever, it gives its hearty approval to any
token that the Fire Commission may see
fit to give him.
