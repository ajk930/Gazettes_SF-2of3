Captain Parker completed his prelim

and returned to-night to New York. He
will resume his examination next week.
The Navy Department to-day admitted
that Captain Parker had lodged a com
plaint with Acting Secretary Hackett
about the treatment he had received.
Hackett explained to him that the regu-
Admiral Sampson replied that after con
sidering the information contained In the
message he had decided In favor of the
Â¦olan already adopted of holding the posi
tion off Cienfuegos. This plan might.be
changed, he said, when It became certain
that the Spanish fleet was at Santiago.

ITuruseth Tells Labor Council of City
DESCRIBES, THE SITUATION.
The report that many of the disturb
ances alone: the water front were the
work of strikers was denounced as false.
A vote vras passed censuring all persons
who have engaged in quarrels with non
union men or the police during the strike,
and calling upon all union men to do all
in their power to preserve the peace.
Instructions were issued to all pickets
to report at headquarters at 10 o'clock
this morning for service.
The noattcr of sending out pickets on
night- duty was discussed, with the result
that fifty men were detailed for that
work. After adjournment one gang was
sent to the Broadway wharf and the other
to tie Pacific Mail dock with instructions
to request every non-union worker to
cease work In the Interests of union prin
ciples.
It' was reported that the efforts made
by. the shipowners to replace the strikers
with non-union men were meeting with
failure. The action of the Japanese So
cie'ty in declining to furnish Japanese to
take the places of strikers was cheered to
the echo.
A. largely attended meeting of the Long
shoremen's Union was held at East and
Mission' streets last night. The strike and
the best means for effecting a settlement
of the dispute were discussed for more
than two hours. A number of stirring ad
dresses were made during the evening by
speakers- who urged upon the strikers to
stand by the federation to the last. A
vote, of confidence in the federation was
passed. '

The executive board of the City Front
Federation held a very short session last
night, but only minor details of the strike
were tinder consideration, as the labor
leaders did not care to take action that
might put an end to further conferences
and efforts to formulate terms of- peace
that would be acceptable to both sides. '
At the meeting of the San Francisco
la.bor Council last night the following
recommendation, which gives the execu
tive committee power to call out unions
affiliated with the Labor Council if settle
ment is not reached by to-night, was
adopted:
Your executive committee recommends that
penfllng present negotiations to establish
Industrial peace a-filiated unions not locked
out , or on strike ' be hereby requested to con
tinue at lieir reci>ectlve -work, but if before
&Â£tar>fiay night, August 3, no definite results
accrue from the present negotiations the com
mittee is hereby specifically instructed to take
stepe to support the unions now locked out or
on strike by advising appropriate action on the
part of tie unions that can arsist In the
tpeefly settlements of the lockouts and strikes.
This action was taken in executive ses
sion, after Andrew Furuseth, secretary of
the Sailors' Union of the Pacific,
had stated that Mayor Phelan had re
ceived a reply from Attorney Michael to
the City Front Federation's request for a
fuller statement of the Employers' Asso
ciation's position, but that the Mayor had
not considered it a fair statement of that
position and had declined to give it out or
to act upon it
Labor Council Acts.
Conferences held during the day secured
no definite results, and while a reply was
received to the request made by the City
Front Federation for more liffht on tho
terms proposed by the Employers' Asso
ciation, it proved to have been drafted,
adbording to Mayor Phelan. by M. F.
Michael, attorney for the association, and
not by the directors. The. Mayor refused
to receive it as official or to submit it to
the Citv Front Federation. At. his re
quest the labor leaders agreed to let con
ditions remain in etatu quo to give him
an opportunty to try to get the directors
of the Employers' Association to take
the entire question under consideration to
day. â¢ ' '
It Is generally asserted by labor leaders
that if an agreement is not reached by

given for a continuance of the truce, ne

We wish to state that In drawing up the
proposition which we I previously submitted

by the directors of the association. At
about 5 o'clock he received a reply, in
which the request of the City Front Fed
eration for a more explicit statement was
complied with, and a new statement of the
position of the employers made. Shortly
afterward Mayor Phelan had another con
ference with the labor leaders and later
in the evening he announced that the re
ply would not be given to the press.
"The new and more explicit statement,"
Mayor Phelan said, "was made by Attor
ney Â¦ Michael and not by the directors of
the association. There was no meeting of
the directors, though I had urged that
one be held on account of the gravity of

The fact was brought to my attention yes

had been landed upon the dock -without hav
ing: applied to- the Collector or this bureau for
permission to- land under the terms of the
exclusion act. Later some of the leaders of
the labor unions made a i formal protest and
requested my intervention. There being clearly
a violation of the exclusion act, X communi
cated the facts to National Immigration Com
missioner Powderly. Mr. Powderly wired In
structions to me this morning to order the
crew back upon the steamer. He declared their'
presence on the dock an infraction of the ex
clusion act. I did so, and took the necessary
steps myself to prevent their coming back upon
the dock to-day. This action of the depart
ment and of the bureau has nothing to do with
the present labor troubles. It was simply the
enforcement of the exclusion . law without any
discrimination whatever.
Chief Dunn of the Chinese Bureau
makes the following statement concerning
the affair:
Chief Dunn accordingly communicated
with the steamship company and ordered
the return of the Chinese to the steamer.
The command was immediately complied

THE fourth day of the strike de
veloped no appreciable change In
the condition of affairs along the
front- Several vessels cleared

they are making a -winning fight. On the

advantage is with them. The casual ob

been gained by either side.
The Coptic succeeded In getting out yes

hands. The Aconcagua is being unloaded
by her crew of Chileans at Howard-street
wharf. They succeeded in landing but a
small portion of her cargo yesterday.

For a number of years Graham's wife

she claimed, sacrificed her in order to

of Charles Compton, who four years ago

The Compton case has cost Los Angeles
County about $.20,000, and Â¦ although , the
accused* Is now dismissed y he â¢ has spent
four years and seventeen days In jail. In
his order dismissing Compton Judge Shaw
says: y - -. . Â¦Â¦..Â¦ Â¦- ..Â¦.Â¦..
There never, has been any serious ques
tion ' in' my- mind that the defendant was
properly - convicted. The-' reversal was
upon a point purely technical and not in
volving the question of guilt or innocence.
I. think It -is proper to say here also that
the decision of the Supreme Court, bo far
as it is sustained by the facts, was made
upon a- point not presented to the court
below and not preserved in the record be
fore the Supreme Court.
? "The decision In substance Is that the
second panel of . jurors, â¢ called from an
other : department to complete the jury,
was not regularly bnwght Into court.
This objection was . not - made upon the
trial and Â¦ does not appear in the record.
If made at all it was upon the -argument
In the Supreme Court. It Is well settled
that such an objection cannot be made
for the first Ltlme in that court."
, Continuing Judge Shaw says that the
citation of the case, the ' people vs. Ed
wards. Is "wholly. Inapplicable" and "Is
not 1 authority for the absurd proposition
that the names. of a second panel, called
only- to be used upon . an uncertain con
tingency, or : the ' names of Jurors sum
moned for other departments, must be
put into the box along with these of the
regular panel before the selection is bs
gun." In conclusion the Judge says:
"It is to bÂ« regretted that the Supreme
Court Is , so crowded .with Its work that
it cannot give to the cases before It a
sufficient examination and consideration
to; avoid such errors. In this case the
result is a miscarriage of 'justice."

EQUALIZERS CONSIDER
THE SOUTHERN"' PACIFIC
Plan Proposed to Take Small Branches
; Out of Hands of County
/ Assessors. :
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 2.â The Southern
Pacific Railroad was taken up by the
State Board of Equalization late this
afternoon .and partially considered. The
statement disclosed no increased length,
as compared with a year ago, but an in
crease in trackage is shown, due to addi
tion of spurs and sidings, and the doub
ling of track a distance of thirty miles.
The length of the road was given at
2089.02 miles and the value at $17,500,000
this year as compared with $14,715,000," last
year's figure. The earnings this year are
given as $17,004,503 88, against $14,145, 729 15,
last year's sum.' The actual net income
"is given as $1,277,822 55. A deficiency was
claimed last year of $12,355 73. . Â¦
Equalizer j Toland announced his inten
tion to move ! to-morrow that the assess
ment of certain small branches be taken
out of the hands of the County/Assessors
and placed with the State Equalizers, it
is claimed by other Equalizers that the
assessment of the local Assessors is lower
than would be that of the State Board
and that therefore no additional revenue
would be derived. It is probable that
'Poland's motion will provoke a lively de
bate to-morrow. - . ;
The board spent. the earlier part of the
day examining the statement of the Cen
tral .Pacific Railroad. The operating
earnings in California are given as $9,006,
716 40, against $7,996,291 48 a year ago,- or
an increase of $1,010,424 92. The. total
other earnings, including switching

Mayor A. P. Dennis had to interfere
personally to-night with a body of strik
ers and prevent them from taking David
Alman, a machinist of Brooklyn, forcibly
to the camp across the river. The Mayor
took the man to the train and paid his
fare out of town to protect him.
"Reports are in circulation to-night that
more men are coming on the midnight
train. Organizer Griffith said to-night: 'It
is pretty near time for the American Fed
eration of Labor to take part In this
strike. This afternoon their men locked
a car door on us and would not allow us
in where the strike-breakers were. I pro
pose to enter a protest about this matter
where it will count.' "
*H At the close of the thlr^ week of the
f^H e .^P 011^ the steelworkers In the
\Vellsville plant of the American Sheet
Steel Company the cteel trust has the bet
ter of the argument. Nine new tnen from
Scottsdale were taken into the mill to
day. The men were in the parlor car of
the afternoon train, and the doors were
locked at East Liverpool and the strikers'
pickets refused permission to enter. When
the mill was reached the train was
stopped and the men were rushed under
the stockade before the pickets were able
to get to them. The strikers are in an
ugly mood to-night and much chagrined
over the company getting the men into
the mill. Â¦Â¦ i Â¦
During the day many telegrams were
received at the association conference
rooms, the last coming just before ad
journment, and all were answered
promptly. The last answer was . in all
probability the announcement of the New
York people that the trip would be made
by the officials to-night, carrying out an
arrangement entered into at Veryl Pres
ton's rooms in the Hotel Henry a short
time before. At about 4:45 p. m. Messrs.
Shaffer, Williams and Chappelle went to
Preston's rooms ana- were closeted with
him for about thirty minutes. The un
derstanding is that at this meeting Pres
ton made known the combination's only
concession In the matter of reopening the
conference where it left oft three weeks
ago. This concession was in the shape of
a demand that if a new conference is
granted it must be specifically stated be
forehand what Is expected to be accom
plished, what ground Is to be covered and
what companies are to participate.
This brings the matter up to the Amal
gamated Association, and the mission of
its high officials to New York Is doubtless
to convince the steel people there that a
new conference is' essential to peace and
an amicable settlement cf the strike trou
bles.
The conference to-day was a repetition
of yesterday, the strictest kind of secrecy
being maintained as to the happenings in
side the room.
A telegram from Wellsvllle, Ohio, to
night says:
PITTSBURG, Aug> 2.- Judging by indi
cations that are practically f actsÂ» peace
or war in the steel troubles will be an
nounced from New York City to-morrow.
When the Amalgamated Association ex
ecutive committee adjourned this evening
President Shaffer announced that another
meeting will be held to-morrow. There
will probably be a meeting here to-mor
row 'of a portion of the board, but 'the
national officers will be " in New York.
They left for that city to-night at 10
o'clock. The circumstances leading up < to
this unexpected trip, while not officially
made known, are evident enough to sub
stantiate the story which follows:

ing and hardihood and iron endurance are not
merely indispensable- traits for successful pio
neers; they are also- traits which must go to
the make-up of every mighty and successful

the West did more even than you thought, for
you shaped thereby the destiny of the whole
republic and as a necessary corollary pro
foundly Influenced the course of events through
out the world. More and more, as the years
go by, this republic will find its guidance in
the thought and action of the West, -because
the conditions of development in the "West
have steadily tended to accentuate the pe
culiarly American characteristics of its people.
Incomparably slower. In all the history of
mankind there is nothing that quite parallels
the way In which our people have filled a

wealths, knit into one nation. And of all this
marvelous history, perhaps the most wonder
ful portion is that which deals with the way
la which the Pacific Coast and the Rocky

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 2.â There was not
a breath of air blowing at the track to
day and the hot wave made itself felt in
the attendance. However, this hot spell
has worked wonders with many old-time
trotters and pacers and caused them to
loosen their joints and move faster than
they have for years.
The judges to-day were Thomas Bonner,-
A. C. Gurnett and Professor E. P. Heald.
The timers were William Murray, Charles
Durfee and George Gray.
There were no sensational features as
the favorites won all the events. The
fastest record of the meeting, 2:10*4, wa3
made by Myrtha "Whips in the free-for-all
pace. The first event was a trial against
time. The Gossiper mare, Lady Fair,
started to beat 2:31, but she just man
aged to get a mark of 2:30. The free-for
all pace had three starters â Kelly Briggs,
Edna R and Osito. Kelly Briggs was the
favorite. In the first heat Edna R broke
at the eighth pole, caught her stride
again, but it was too late, for Kelly
Briggs won by a length from Myrtha
Whips in 2:12^4, Edna R hopelessly dis
tanced. Myrtha Whips captured the next,
heat in 2:10&, defeating Kelly Briggs by
& neck.
In the 2:14 class trotting race, which fol
lowed, there were six entriesâ Richmond
Chief, Osito, Ned Thorne. Auzella. Boy
dello and Nora McKinney- Auzella was
made favorite, while the rest sold at from
$4 to $6 to $1 in the books After several
ineffectual attempts to get off on even
terms Starter Cohen sent them away. Ised
Thorne took the lead, with Richmond
Chief and Nora McKinney close up. The
favorite was two lengths further behind,
while Osito broke into a run at the quar
ter pole and before catching his stride lost
all chances of being a contestant. At the
half Nora McKinney broke and fell back.
Auzella came up with a rush and passed
her and Richmond Chief and set sail for
Ned Thorne. They trotted head and head
to the wire, but the former won by a apse
in the excellent time of 2:11%.
â¢Auzella was favorite for the next heat
again, and the way she" led the procession
from "end to end" was disheartening to
those who backed Ned Thorne. It seemed
as if the preceding heat had taken all the
speed away from them, for this was won
in 2:16%. Bunch made one of his sensa
tional homestretch > drives and got the
place from Ned Thorne oy a length, while
Auzella was five lenghts in advance, i The
bookies held out Auzella for the next heat,
but offered }12 on Richmond Chief. $3 on
Ned Thorne, $15 on Boydello and $8 on
Nora McKinney. Auzella had no trouble
in capturing this heat, for she outclassed
all her rivals. .Ned Thorne passed Nora
McKinney, who was second, and in the
homestretch tried , to , pass Auzella, who
easily outfooted him to the wireâ time 2:16,
Richmond Chief and Boydello just saving
their distance. Auzella won the next heat
and race In a jog in 2:23%.
The last race of the day was for the
Golden Gate stakes. The starters were: A.
Joseph's Durfee Me, J. O'Kane's Sandow
D. R. Misner's Sable Le Grande and D
Roberts' Al Gregor. , The last named was
a favorite. He lost the first heat, how
ever, Sandow winning in 2:10%, Durfee Me
almost at his throat latch, while Al
Gregor was a length further away In
the three succeeding heats Al Gregor won
all driven out in 2:18%. 2:21% and 2:19
â¢ The best - race of the week will -take
place to-morrow. It Is for the 2:17 clasa
pacers, and a number of patrons /at good
racing arrived from San Francisco and
adjacent cities to-night. a

the San Francisco Kennel Club show
were received as follows:
The Oakland show will be held by the
Alameda County Poultry Association, and
John Bradshaw will be the manager and
superintendent. Inquiries addressed to
him at the "Woodlawn Kennels, corner of
Geary street and Central avenue, will re
ceive prompt attention. The judges se
lected so far for this show are Normaji
Stewart for collies, P. E. Miller for cock
ers, Charles Harker for St. Bernards and
mastiffs and James J. Lynn for all ter
riers. The show will be held under the
American Kennel Club rules, and the win
ners* classes will probably have the same
value as Los Angeles, as the number of
entries will be at least fully as large.
Fred Lueck of Sacramento has had the
misfortune to lose his noted St. Bernard
bitch Beauty by death. Beauty was well
known on the bench, where she has won
many prizes.
Mr. Albert Joseph, the enthusiastic
bull terrier breeder, has recently added
to his kennels the Boston terrier bitch
Lady Montez, by Champion Spider out of
Lizzie.
The Los Angeles show will be! given by
the Sixth Agricultural Association, in con
nection with the fair, and will be under
the rules of the American Kennel Club.

with a boat designed by Matthew Turner
of Benicia and of a type very similar to
this year's challenger. Indeed, both the
Gadder and the Helen, though falling
within the letter of the definition of
"cabin yachts," are nearer to being mere
racing machines than any other craft on

keel sloop Spider, imported from Hong

smooth water, it is doubtful whether she
will prove so speedy in rough water. As
the race will take place in the channel,
the breeze is likely to be stiff and the
water pretty rough. Frank Stone, too, is
thoroughly familiar with the eddies and
currents that cut an important figure in a
channel race. A special element of inter
est attaches to the race in the fact that
both the challenger and the defender will
be sailed by the men who designed, built
and own them. â¢ . Â¦

Cresceus was not' unduly fatigued by
his effort, and half an hour later seemed
ready for another mile.
Enthusiasm broke loose as soon as the
horse had passed the wire. The crowd
rushed on to the track to greet the cham
pion, and a huge wreath of flowers was
hung round his . neck. ' Mr. Ketcham,
owner and driver, was carried to the

thirty. Now the wind Â¦ was at his back,
and realizing the advantage, Ketcham
kept him at a great clip. The half-mile
pole was reached in 69% seconds, a record
never before- attained, and here It was
that the second runner caught him up.
Into the far turn and around it, the
great stallion thundered, his mighty mus
cles and machine-like stride carrying him
as if on wings. The ' three-quarter pole
was reached and passed in the wonderful
time of 1:3014.
Then came the trial, for when Cresceus
turned into the stretch the bitter Â«.wind
beat him in the face and held hini by
force. For the fraction of a second he
seemed to falter, but his driver's voice
was in his ears, and on he came. With
great courage he plunged in toward the
finish with weakened stride, and In spite
of the buffeting of the breeze, flashed
under the wire a winner against time. But
for the wind against, which Cresceus
struggled it is believed this time would
have been a second faster. ; It was Â¦ the
most wonderful mile' ever trotted on^any
track.

weather at noon was unpromising. The
sky was lowering and overcast, and a few
drops of rain fell, though not enough to
hurt the track, which was in excellent con
dition, or to keep the crowd away, but a
very strong wind was blowing from the
south.
About 2 o'clock the heavens cleared and
the sun came out warm and bright, but
the wind did not decrease in force. In the
overnight pool selling a great deal of
money went into the box at the odds of
$25 to $17 on time against the trotter. At
2 o'clock, owing to the fierce wind, the
odds against the great horse increased to
$25 to $8. but the backers of Cresceus were
game and took the short end as long as
pools were Bold.
Tim Murphy Rean. the .trainer, was
ready to accompany Cresceus with a run
ner, and Dan Lahoe waited at the half
mile pole to take him on from there.

trotted in :59?i. the first time that dis

Attorney Arthur Brand, who represents
Mrs. Harriet A. Waldron and her daugh

he waa not yet satisfied with the evidence
as to Lewis' dealings with Mrs. Waldron's
money and would postpone the issuance
of that warrant on that charge.

Jue Lin Ong, who shot and killed Jue
Do Hong, the Chinese boy, last Monday
morning, has been left to his fate, the
Chinese Six Companies having decided
not to render him any financial assistance
for his defense, as he murdered a member
of his own family. When arrested he had
only $3 in his possession. . Â¦ .
v The police fear that the murder of Gee
Chung at 9 Ross . alley early yesterday
morning: may lead to a highbinder war.
The murdered boy belonged to the Suey
Dong Tong, and the members of that tong
are already talking of vengeance.
There are two motives attributed as
possible causes of the. murder. \ One is
that Gee Chung gave information to the
Government as to opium smuggling and
the other that he was singled out as the
victim to even up. scores for the murder of
a' member, of a rival- tong in St. Louis
alley about six weeks, ago. The last named
is supposed to be the real motive, hence
the fear of a highbinder war. â¢ -
Gee Chung was 19 years of age and was
born in this city. His father, Gee Bue,
is the owner of a restaurant at 644 Com
mercial street, where he occasionally
worked. He was a prominent member of
the Chinese Native Sons' organization,
and the police say he was inclined -to go
"the pace." He was entering a gambling
house at 9 Ross alley when shot down.
Detective Ed Gibson has been detailed
on the case, but so far no arrests have
been made. . It was at first reported that
two Chinese ' boys fired the fatal shots,
but Gibson says there were five of them,
showing, that the assassination had been
carefully arranged. Every effort will be
made to arrest the' murderers.

Blight Il6t to starboard. This will be eas
ily rectified, however, by using all the
coal for the furnaces out of the starboard

Two deported Chinese caused some
trouble and considerable amusement just
before sailing time. Ah Wong was
brought to the Mail dock Thursday and
put aboard the steamship half an hour
before sailing time. Seeing people walk-
Ing down the gangway and turning every
few steps to say "grood-by." he thought
he would try the experiment and thus
make his escape. He succeeded in pass-
Ing the officers of the ship, and after call
ing a last farewell to some imaginary
friends on the ship turned to make his
and ran Into the arms of Dr. Gard
Â» ner. Chinese interpreter for the Govern
ment, and Inspector Boyce.
Ah Wong forgot that Chinese visitors
â¢were not allowed aboard and the crowd
could not help laughing when he asked.
"Cannot a person say good-by to his
friends?"
"Most people can, but you can u Get
aboard," was Dr. Gardner's reply, and
the deported man moved up the gang
plank again.
The other iras Leong Woon Ho, a Chi
nese girl who was rescued from a brothel
about four weeks ago. She was security
for a $1000 loan made to her owner and
all kinds of attempts were made to keep
her in the country. She swore she was
born in China and was brought here for
Immoral purposes. Her owner had her
arrested for perjury, claiming she was
born in this country. The charge was
disproved, and yesterday he tried to get
her off the steamship on another charge,
but failed. The girl is now on her way
back to China, where her family will take
care of her.

We oppose this ill adjustment of matters, though
the principle and purpose of reciprocity are abstractly
correct. Applied wisely it would seem that the in
dustries the longest and best protected and the most
firmly established and most abundantly capitalized
should be used in the interest of their juniors which
arc not as well established, are prosecuted at greater
hazard and more exposed to the risks of wind and
weather. t
OUR tariff system is intended to safeguard our
nv<nufacturing_and productive interests and
to furnish the opportunity for such prudent
and non-harmful abatement as may be found condu
cive to the extension of foreign trade. This abate
ment is the reciprocity feature of the system. In
regard to some of the pending reciprocity treaties,
it is our opinion thai they have not been properly'
adjusted. They take from certain horticultural in
dustries that are yet needful of care to give to manu
factures that have beer, long established and for de
cades, many of them ever since 1789, the object of per
sistent protection by the Government.

age of 529 for every 100 miles of line. â¢ The amount
of capital outstanding at that date, was $11,491,034,960.
This amount assigned to a mileage basis represents
a capitalization of $61,490 per mile' of line. The
amount which existed in the form of funded debt was
$5,645,455,367. The amount of capital stock paying
no dividend was $3,176,609,698, or' 54.34 per cent of
the total amouni outstanding. The amount of funded
debt, excluding equipment trust obligations, which
paid no interest, . was $3*78,937,806. Of the stock
paying dividends, 10. iS per cent of the total amount

compel the use of safety equipments on the roads
seems at last to have attained a high degree of suc
cess, for the report says.: "Practically all locomotives,

In the report are contained statistics obtained from

form 'of contract 324 received a fixed money rental,
167 a contingent money rental, and 241 were operated
under some form of agreement or control not read

9.546.00 miles. The corresponding -figure for 1899
was 5846.35 miles.
FROM summaries just given out of the forth
coming report of the Interstate Commerce Com

single-track railway mileage in the United States was
193,345.78 miles, an increase during the year of
4051.12 miles being shown. This is a greater increase

The classes of persons who should be registered in
order to exercise the right of voting at the primaries
have been frequently published, and it is not worth
while to go over them again. It is sufficient to say
that if any citizen does not know that his name is on
the register he should see about it to-day. This is
the last chance.
It is known that the bosses have been working hard
to carry a considerable number of the election dis
tricts. Perceiving that this is a Republican year,
they have directed their efforts mainly toward get
ling control of the Republican convention. Not sat
isfied with the aid given by Herrin and Gage they
have brought to bear upon city politics all the in
fluence that outside bosses may have. Their follow
ing is organized and is being directed with all the
skill the bosses have derived from their long expe
rience in slum politics. To defeat them it will be
necessary for all good citizens to go to the polls.
Representative government cannot be carried on un
less good men see to it that those who represent them
shall be good men.
The issues of the primary elections are fully as
important as any to be submitted at the municipal
election itself. Should the bosses be permitted to
elect their tools to the nominating convention they
will be able to dictate who shall be chosen as candi
dates. Tor office, and then the voters will have no other
choice than that of voting a boss ticket or of scatter
ing their votes for candidates who have no chance
of election. .:'
REGISTRATION for the primary elections
closes to-day. The citizen who fails to have
h'is name registered will by that neglect have
forfeited his franchise so far as the primary election
is concerned. He will have no voice in determining
who is to represent him in the nomination of candi
dltes by his party for the coming municipal election.
He will thus through his indifference to the perform
ance of a public duty have made himself a political
nullity, and to some extent will have served as a
creature of the predatory politicians, who are always
well pleased when good citizens do not register.

"At least three or four years would be
required to build a graving dock in the
Philippines. It occurred to me that one
way to meet the situation was to tow a
dock to the archipelago. After careful
examination of the papers regarding the
Spanish dock in the harbor of Havana I
concluded that it would be suitable for our
for the national vessels of belligerents,
and had war occurred our situation would
have been most embarrassing.

a general overhauling and that can be
done at comparatively little expense."
Rear Admiral Bowles, In order to de
termine which method Is the least expen
sive, has suggested to Secretary Long
that he obtajn proposals from private
contractors for towing the. dock to the
Philippines. It is estimated that the
cost would approximate $100,000. Desir
ous of saving money, Rear Admiral
Bowles contemplates recommending that
naval colliers, specially fitted up. be or
dered to tow the dock to the Far Cast.
The route and the distance the dock
would be towed are thus stated by the
Navy Department:

One must go to "Holy Willie's" prayer, to find
hypocrisy equal to. that, and to Bill Sykes for a viler
inspiration than was behind it.Â° : The Secretary of
State has nothing to do with sending liquor or any
other commercial article to our "newly acquired do
minions," and could .'neither , favor nor .prevent it.
Yet this fiendish fool conveys to his readers the im
pression that the Secretary of State,- having the power,
has ' favored and promoted the importing of liquor
into those. islands, and that Providence. has therefore
him sorely as a father.
Patience- with such creatures is so difficult* that it
ceases to be a virtue. . ,
â¢ The cry of'the Hursts and Fergusons against it pro
ceeds by the use of mendacity and brutality that re
pel sensible, and decent people. There is, an idiocy,
a sheer cretinism, about these raving creatures which
amuses while it infuriates.- For instance," in the ar
ticle quoted from' the Christian Instructor the-edi
tor, after grinning, gloating and gibbering over the
sorrow of Secretary Hay, and informing him that God
killed his son purposely to punish him, asks: "What
will the Secretary do now? Will he still favor the
sending of liquor into the newly acquired dominions?"
The facts are that the morals, health and discipline
of the enlisted men were suffering from their abuse
of alcohol and soaking of vile liquor in the deadfalls
around the army posts. They cannot be restrained
from spending their time and their â¢ pay thkt way.
Off duty, their time is their own, and their leisure was
not allowed to be spent in virtue for lack of vicious
temptation. Army officers, and especially the medical
corps, cast about for some remedy and found it in
the post canteen. Only light beer and wine were
sold, the expenditure of the men was limited, their
indulgence- was under discipline, the profits went
into a post library; the canteen was the enlisted
man's club, reading-room and library, and 1 in its en
joyment he was under the self-restraint of a gentle
man. If it were an evil in. any respect.it was a lesser
evil than the deadfall which it. supplanted.* There is
positively no evidence, outside the ravings of crea
tures who gloat over a father's grief, for the death
of his 'son, that the canteen was anything but an im
provement, a vast and visible improvement, oh- the
deadfall.
In the, foregoing is a fair statement of the conten
tion of these people, and of some of the means, ar
guments and pretended statements of fact by which
they attempt to prove their position.
We have no doubt that the wretch who wrote that
would have also rejoiced in the/ death* of Mrs. Me'-.
Kinley had it resulted from her recent illness, and
would have seen in it a judgment on the President.
The ghoul and hyena who runs the Christian In
structor so instructively feels a slight twinge, for he>
closes his vile attack by saying: "To some it may
seem unfeeling to write thus of a heart-broken pub
lic man. But we feel that it is time to speak out
so plainly that men may be led to think rightly on
this pressing and practical subject."
To show "that the President was favorable, con
amore, to the liquor traffic and- desirous of extending
it under his official patronage these people declared
with all positiveness that he was a drunkard and that
he and his Cabinet had a debauch in the President's
room at the Capitol on the last night of a session of
Congress. One of the organs of these people, called
"The Christian Instructor," published in Philadelphia,
gloats over the death of Secretary Hay's son, and de
clares that it was the direct work of .Providence to
avenge on the head of the Cabinet the sin of estab
lishing the canteen, and that: "If they will not heaV
the voice of reason and righteousness the judgments
of God may reach them in some unforeseen and un
usual form, so that all may see in it the hand of
God." â¢ Â¦
-The contention made by him and others like him
is thaj the President and War Department .willfully,
and for no good reason nor purpose, established
saloons â or, in the vocabulary of reform, "rum holes"
â at the army posts for the purpose of corrupting
and destroying the enlisted men. It is charged that
this was dene corruptly and flagrantly, at the demand
and procurement of the liquor league, or Rum Power,
or by whatever other names these people call it/" for,
the purpose of increasing the profits from- the sale
of red liquor. It is charged that among the enlisted
men murder, suicide and crime became rife as a re
sult of the opening 01 the canteen.
AN organ of reform published in this State prints
several columns by Mr. Hurst of Woodland
on The Call and the army canteen. We have
no further words with Mr. : Hurst, whose intemperance
of statement and conscientious avoidance of the truth
put him beyond recognition, except by a kick such as
is deserved by a cur who calls attention to himself
by snapping and snarling.
PACT AND FANATICISM.
.Joseph Chamberlain has not been very successful
as'an imperial statesman, but he is getting plenty of
praise just now for his virtue as. a citizen.- Despite
all the attractions/ of London and the pressure of
Ministerial affairs he keeps up: his connection with
Birmingham, takes a keen interest in municipal pot
tics and fulfills every civic duty. The example is one
that a good many rich Americans would do well to
follow. ,/;;.:/Â¦ /'"<Â¦_> Â¦" 'Â¦/'Â¦-â¢"
We repeat, however, that the oil producers are
doing well in making their fight in this open manner.
To them and to their attorneys something of public
gratitude is due. They are giving the people one
more object lesson on the evils of Herrinism, and
therefore are helping en the coming of the time when
that form of corruption will be forced out of our
politics. 1 ;
That the railroad men will do what they can to
make it easy for the Commissioners is already evi
dent. When asked to give definite information con
cerning some important factor in the case the head
of one department says he does not know, and the
information must be sought from the head of an
other department. Th'us the question is shifted along
the line. No one answers it a'nd no one is respon
sible for the lack of answer. Such evasions help the
commission a good deal, but in the end the issue
will be up to them. They will have to face it, and
there is no doubt as to how they will act. It is not
likely that as soon as the hearing is'over one of the
Commissioners will draw a type-written decision
from his pocket and read it at once, as Judge McKin
ley of Los Angeles read the Herrin decision in favor
of Kelly's so-called Republican County Committee a
short time ago,/but just the same the decision will be
forthcoming and neither of the Commissioners will
have had the^trouble of writing it.
It will be remembered that when the famous grain
'rate cases were before the courts Commissioners
Blackstock and Laumeister hobnobbed 'with Herrin,
drank his wine, shook his hand with glee and then at
his suggestion dismissed the cases. Mr. Herrin has
still a good deal of wine which he can put where it
will do mest good. His influence with the commis
sion has not lessened during the time the people have
not been looking. Still it is worth while to bring
the Commissioners to the front again, and compel
them once more to choose between official duty and
a Herrin dinner.
the people of California, and with the sympathy there
is joined something of admiration. A fight against
wrong and corruption is never without its "good
effect, even though it be defeated in every end that
it aimed at. It will not be wholly useless for the oil
men to. "once more bring clearly and impressively to
the attention of Californians the evil effects of* South
ern Pacific domination in this State. It is worth
while once again to bring the Railroad Commission
face to face with its duty under the light of a public
investigation. It is beneficial to once more reveal
the close relation between the commission and W:
F. Herrin. The lesson which in this case is about to
be taught the people is an old one, but it should be
iterated and reiterated until Californians have learned
it so well they will know how to act upon it. .
In making this fight, which is in the nature of a
forlorn hope, the petitioners have the sympathy of
Herrin, or at his dictation.
In fact, it is a foregone conclusion that the com
mission will uphold the railroad; and it would not be
surprising to the people if, after the decision has been
given, it should transpire that it was written by \W F.
ONCE more the representatives of a great in
dustry in California have applied to the State
Railroad Commission to obtain redress from
the exactions of the Southern Pacific Company bent
upon extorting from the industry. all the traffic will
bear. The. oil producers are seeking to obtain a'
transportation rate, on oil* from the producing dis
tricts to this city that will enable them to supply this
market on fair terms with their competitors, and they
have submitted their case to the State iCommission.
The hearings will of course-be watched and noted
with close attention by all who take an interest in
such matters, but it is to be doubted if there be a
sane man in the State who has any expectation that
justice will be done.
A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.
Despite- those appliances; however, the 'danger, of
accidents continues high. 'The report says: The
total number, of casualties to persons on account of
railway accidents during the year ending. June 30,
1900, was 58,185; ' The aggregate, number" of persons
killed in consequence 'of railway accidents, during the
year was 7865, and the number injured was 50,320.
Of railway employe's 2550 were killed and 39,643, were
injured. One summary shows .that in the course of
thirteen years ending June 30,- 1900, in consequence of
railway accidents, 86,277 persons were killed and
469,027 persons were injured. The injuries reported
varied from comparatively trivial injuries to those
of a fatal character. The casualties, for the period
mentioned occurred to persons as follows: Employes
killed 38,340, injured 361,789; passengers killed 3485,
injured 37,72g; other persons (including trespassers) Â¦
killed -54,452;. injured 69,509. -'
were fitted with automatic couplers, and - ; nearly all
passenger cars were equally equipped." . â¢'â¢

The accident occurred at 6 o'clock, just

was the duty of the Japanese to close the

on the elevator and started upward, but
was caught between the body of the lift

With the knowledge that the charter is
defective pn that point. City Treasurer
Brooks hfes been for months importuning
Mayor Phelan. as the head officer of the
municipality, to count the money in his
safe. Mr. Brooks beReved that this
course was necessary for his own pro
tection, although the charter is silent on
the subject. The Mayor has delayed com
plying with the request of the Treasurer
on the plea that he was not required to
count the coin. Finally Phelan agreed to
perform the job, and at 5 o'clock Wednes
day, accompanied by Secretary Fay, he
entered the Treasurer's office and began
Â¦â¢he work of counting the money.
/Phelan evidently forgot the unpleasant
experience of the municipality in the Wid
ber affair, for he proceeded to "heft" the
bags of gold and silver coin. Simply by
their supposed weight did the Mayor as
certain to his own satisfaction whether
they contained $10,000 In gold or $1000 in
silver. He labored exactly one hour in
hefting Jl.S89.5e9 61. which the vaults con
tained. The amount was .only 8 cents
short of the actual sum called for by the
books. His Honor perspired freely with
his exertions and aftenrfard departed sat
isfied that the money was all there. Of
the total amount, $1,500,000 is in the Joint
custody safe and $205,304 in the outer
vault,, the rest being made up of other
accounts.
Among the other defects . contained in
the charter there is no provision made
for the counting of the money in the city
treasury. The only safeguard Is the
"joint custody safe," to which the Audi
tor and Treasurer alone have access. The
outer vault, however, is used by tha
Treasurer's deputies and contains several
hundred thousand dollars at all times, but
no check is provided by the charter for
the safety of the coin therein.
Mayor Phelan counted the coin in the
city treasury on "Wednesday evening by
the same "hefting" method which he util
ized when Augustus Widber was Treas
urer of this city and county, and as a
result of which that official was enabled
to steal $116,000 from the vaults, for which
he Is now serving a term In State's prison.
After a lapse of nearly half a century
J. A: Reis, A. S. Baldwin and M. H. Mead
are to get back the money loaned to the
State for the purpose of carrying on an
Indian war. Such is the effect of a de
cision of the Supreme Court yesterday,
which ends litigation extending over the
period since 1S56.
According to an act of the Legislature
passed on May 3, 1S52, and known as the
."'Indian war bond loan," the State bor
rowed nearly a million dollars to conduct
campaigns against Indians in the northern
counties. It was expected that Congress
would pay for the wars, and in the event
that there should be no help fro-m the
National Government it was stipulated
that, although the State should be liable
for the amount borrowed, interest: should
not be paid for a, period longer than ten
years. -
In 1S54 Congress appropriated $924,
259 65 to pay off the loan. In 1856 it was
found that the State owed in principal
and interest $1,150,043 32. It was then con
tended on the part of the State that as
the Congressional appropriation had been
exhausted the rest of the debt would have
to go unpaid. This contention was not fa
vorably entertained by the creditors and
litigation was commenced.
Some of the claimants have lost their
money by reason of legal technicalities
and others have kept up the fight. In the
cases of Reis, Baldwin and Mead the
lower court sustained their claims. Appeal
was then taken to the Supreme Court by
the State and the Judgment was affirmed.
Reis gets about $35,000 and the other tw,o
together about the same amount. Accord
ing to the original act interest for only
ten years can be collected. Although the
money was for the most part loaned at
12 per cent, the investment was hardly
a good one, as the funds have been lying
dormant for about forty years.

Mr. Marx came to the United States
from Germany at the age of 10 years and
settled in Alabama, where he had. two
brothers who were large planters, and re
mained there until the gold excitement in
California, in 1S49, and he then started for
San Francisco via Panama, where he was
compelled to remain some months on ac
count Of the steamer being disabled, and
did not arrive 'n San Francisco until Feb
ruary, 1850, and went directly to the mines
and remained there some time, afterward
going to Idaho as an Indian fighter, and
in the early '60's went to Nevada and there
engaged in the forwarding business for
the railroad at Toano, where he remained
until 1876. He then made an extended trip
to Europe and returned to the United
States, settling near Napa on a ranch
known as Ellt Park, which is considered
one of the most beautiful homes in Napa
County. Early in the <'80's he made an ex
tended trip, visiting all the principal
places, around the world, accompanied by
his wife. Mr. Marx had been ailing for
the last six or eight months, and two
weeks ago was removed to Lane's Hos
pital, where he died.
Mr. Marx was best liked where best
known. He has been a generous giver to
many worthy societies, and though done
without ostentation his benevolences
have been many and far reaching. He
was a whole-souled man, from whom men
sought and never failed to receive good
advice and. assistance. He v will be
mourned by a wide circle of " acquaint
ances.

Chief Angus McLeod read a carefully pre-,
pared and most interesting paper on the
Canadian Scot, whose forefathers, he said,
had been evicted from the highlands of
Scotland and had made homes for them
selves and their descendants in Canada.
He referred to those who had become fa
mous in statesmanship, the professions
and in commerce, and after paying a
glowing tribute to the Canadian Scot as
a man, he concluded:
"Our people are at peace with all the
world, and especially with the greatest of
all nations, over which proudly floats the
Hag of stars. Hand in hand with his near
pst neighbor the Canadian Scot is march
ing peacefully \ and proudly on, making
strides in all \ that pertains to the ad

Until a very short time ago tjie Oriental
Mission entertained the very loftiest . es
teem for Frank Kane's measures. Now
the war is on, and In the Washington
street home unkind things afe said of
him. In December of 1900 Kane displayed
a zeal and ardor in the rescue of mal
treated Chinese slave girls worthy of his
title. At that time he rescued San Jung
from a doubtful future and had; her placed
in the care of Mrs. Lake at tne Oriental
Home after securing the guardnanship pa
pers. The child was- given =every care
and attention and all went well: for a time.
But then the break came and ihe Metho
dist Mission ladles in charge oÂ£ the home
say that not in thirty years 5 .has any
such experience befallen thfir labors.
They know San Jung'and her*llfe's his
tory, and that Is why Kane ijiust go> to
court . before the Chinese &ir| may; be
taken 'from the home. , ?- .
Up at the Oriental Home, at'912 Wash
ington street, it is claimed thai Sajj Jung
was sold into slavery for $102 when she
was 2 years old. For fear of*thi> possi
bility that the child might agaiw # forced
into slavery her present custd<J1Sins will
not give the girl up. Kane h^V. written
letters to the Oriental Home Â«JÂ«mandlng
the delivery of the girl, whom fve wishes
to place in the -family of ChJttn Wing
Chung, a Chinese merchant, n^vidlng at
754 Washington street. Chan Wing is a
married man with a family. Kane de
clares that it will benefit the mission and
its Â¦work if the Chinese girl is placed with
the merchant and his family, arid prom
ises a speedy return of San Jung to the
home if conditions should be different
from what they seem. Mrs. Lake and
Miss Margaret Lake of the Oriental Home
cannot understand why Chan "Wing
should want San Jung when he has a wife
and family of his own. So Kane will have
to fight for the possession "of his ward.
Frank J. Kane of the Pacific Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
and Children and the Suppression of Vice,
and the Oriental Home are quarreling.
The cause of the trouble is # Chinese girl
6 years of age now In possession of Mrs.
Lake, of the Methodist Mlssioji. and over
whom Kane has the court rights of guard
ianship. Kane wants the girl, whose name
is San Jung, and the Oriental Mission
refuses to deliver its charge, tin Judge
Cook's court at 10 o'clock thiis morning
the entire matter will be brought up for
settlement on a,, writ to produce the body
of little. San Jung. t
HE last of the conventions of the
ill â¢ different dioceses embraced In the
Ml .: Episcopal church of the United
II States has been held, and the dele
. gates to the triennial convention
of the church have been elected. VThe In
dications are that the coming assemblage
will be a notable one. ~
The work appointed for it Is deemed. of
great importance for the future of the
church.- The attendance, promises to be
the greatest ever known. . Every _ delegate,
so far as heard from, will be accompanied
by members of his family, and the aggre
gate will tax the hospitality of the city to
Its greatest extent. The eloquence of -the

Copious rains throughout the western half
of the country have had the predicted effect
of producing a more cheerful tone, and the
f ealing is decidedly more hopeful than it v.-as
a week or two ago.. Rains practically Insured
a large ' spring wheat crop, although the
damage already done appears to have been
serious, judging from the strength of the corn
market Itself and the advices of heavily re
duced yields which are reiterated from the sec
tions affected. Bradstreet's advices point j to
the early corn crop ] as practically a failure I In
the leading surplus-producing States west of
the Mississippi, but late, corn undoubtedly has
been saved and as time elapses estimates of
production are being raised. From the rest of
the country trade advices are In the main quite
cheerful and despite the Intense ' heat and
drought of July an extraordinarily large busi
ness appears to have been done, which Is re
flected In the bank clearings for that | month.
Cotton crop conditions improved in the South
as a result of the recent rains and trade ad
vices are correspondingly more cheerful. â¢ Pa
effle Coast crop advices Â¦ are also better, al
though shipping activity is Â¦ interfered with .'at
San Francisco by a strike. - The Northwest
will " produce crops largely I in', excess of last
year, and a heavy fall trade Is anticipated > in
that section. The < poorest advices naturally
come from the Central : West ' and Southwest,
but it Is significant that points like Kansas City
report that cancellations have stopped and that
the outlook is muchbetter. Â¦ .-..-â¢: Â¦-

I CHICAGO, Aug. 2.â At the opening of the
corn market the news was bullish from a new
sourceâthe Northwest,' where, it. was said the
area of heat and drought had extended Itself,
to the detriment of the ! plant. Nebraska
drought news added to , the . bullishness. Sep
tember opened , with salesfrom 5S@59c, the lat
ter figure being lc over yesterday's close. Crop
reports from Iowa and certain other portions
of the corn belt were more cheerful, so that the
bulls did not have everything "their own way.
Liquidation by longs, who had profits in sight,
however, proved , to be ' the factor destined to
shape the course of prices. Selling for the lo
cal account brought out ' stop loss orders ami
September tumbled from Its pinnacle - to 57% c
before the bull party asserted itself and forced
the price up to 58%c. Here the support weak
ened and the liquidation bought afresh, with
the result that September declined to 57c and
closed weak, %c under yesterday at 57%c -.
Â¦An advance at Liverpool and sympathy with
corn, together with light Argentine shipments
influenced wheat at the opening, â¢ which was %
@%c higher for September, at . 69%@69%c.
Trade for a few moments only was of a general
character,' thereafter the trade was of a scalp
ing order in which the ; influence of corn was
plainly seen. Excellent prospects for the spring
wheat crop and stagnation of the. export busi
ness .were, further influences .which .worked
against I the ] price during the remainder j of the
session. - The market. yielded slowly but surely

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2.-The futility of the ef
forts made this week to awaken any Interest
In the stock market or to effect a movement of
prices that offered any chance for attractive
profits to traders resulted in a very small at
tendance this morning of even the class of deal
crs on the board. There is no trace of any
other operations than those by traders This
morning's market; as a consequence, made per
ceptible progress toward the condition of ab
solute stagnation, to which it has been tend
ing all the week. Apparently the market was
left wholly to the devices of the email room
traders. There was no evidence of the exist
ence of stop loss selling orders on the one hand
or of supporting orders on the other. Accord
ingly the professionals found their limited
operations quite effective in moving prices But
the operation of taking profits, either by cell
ing long stock to realize or by covering shorts
reveals the fictitious character of the move
ment rzid neutralizes it. The meager trading
centered about the renewed fears of crop dam
age, suggested by the strength in the com
market and the proposed construction of a
rugsr refinery In opposition to the American
Bugar Company. An appearance of considsrable
â¢weakness was thus Induced at one time during
the day. but the closing up of contracts brought
prices back sharply toward last night's level.
Sugar failed to hold its rally and the market
doted heavy. The United States Steel stocks
were less active than for some time past and
failed to show the effects of the reports of
disagreement over the steel strike, both com
mon and preferred, closing with fractional
gains. -.
The railroad bona.n^-kct was barren of any
features. Total sales, par value. $1,500,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. -.

The drought in the corn-growing States has
been broken and was reflected by a general
Improvement in it:?tations for railroad shares.
The recoveries failed, however, to Induce much
fresh buying of securities. It would seem, in
fact, that the covering of shorts by profes
sional interests, especially the Chicago opera
tors, was mainly responsible for the rise, and
when this process exhausted Itself there was
little to supply either strength or activity.
The market was cheered at the besinning of
the week by the announcement that a settle
ment of the steel strike was at hand and there
Is little disposition to regard the interruption
in the negotiations as being more than tem
porary. The condition of . the money market
gives no cause for anxiety, last Saturday's
bank statement having shown another consid
era.ble Increase in the bank reserves, attended
by a further reduction In loans. Â¦ Money is be
ginning to go to the interior for crop-moving
purposes, but this is offset by a movement of
funds from near-by points to New York and
by large receipts of Klondike gold transferred
from San Francisco through the treasury. .The
European- situation is not particularly favor
able, there being a continued strain upon the
banking arrangements of the German empire.
No gold shipments have occurred, although
exchange rates have been firm and It is feared
that Berlin may require further assistance
from both New York and London.

There Is now a very heavy demand for new

something unusual at this time of ths year.
especially in regard to Apples, ,and prices are
tending upward. The market is In first-class
shape. There are no figures on Plums, Prunes
and Pears thus far, but all promise to open
much higher than last year, owing to the re
markable demand for the West, where small

as ' before and Poultry and Meats stand thÂ»

the market, partly owing to the light Crop,
partly to the demand for the Eastern States
and partly to the diversion of shipments from

Wheat is especially active. Western receipts
for the week reaching 6,508,311 bushels, against
5,020,761 last year, and 4,734,363 two years ago,
while Atlantic exports were 4.814.996 bushels,
against 2.737.7S9 in 1900 and 3,765,787 in 1899. -
Dealers In some drought stricken districts
have countermanded orders for footwear and
these cancellations are felt . mainly by West
ern makers, but as a whole the industry Is In
a healthy position. Leather Is quiet, shoe fac
tories buying lightly owing to large supplies
taken recently. Liberal arrivals in hides tend
to depress values. .
: Wool has at last risen slightly above the low
est point in four years. The cotton market
awaits the Government report in -a dull and
weak jiositlon. .
: Failures in July were 697 in number, against
793 last year and $7,035,933 in amount of liabil

Review of, Trade to-morrow win say:. Contin
ued favorable weather conditions have resulted
In" the saving, of much late ' planted corn and
the Northwest. ideal' weather for- spring wheat
harvest has been enjoyed. As this is the point
that ; business . in Â¦ all parts of the country, has
been , most carefully ; watched the general feel
ing is better than a week ago. The disposition
on both sides to settle the steel strike has not
yet resulted in any agreement and the labor
situation is thus kept prominent ; . .
Official returns of piglron production in the
first' half of the 1 year show a record-breaking
aggregate of i 7,764,713 tons, exceeding the re
markable output of the previous' year by 32.
044 . tons. ' The second half, of .1901 has opened
with, a. much.; greater capacity of active fur
naces and the full year promises a considerable
larger total than 13,000,000 tons produced In 1900.
During the past week leading mills have placed
large contracts for- early delivery and inqui
ries for all forms of finished steel are abundant.
There is less disposition to pay fancy â¢ prices
for products than were advanced by the strike,
which 1$ an evidence of the general belief in
early .resumption of work. An unfavorable
showing for the first half year In both exports
and output of copper resulted in the first al
teration in nominal prices since the advance to
17 cents eight months ago.. â¢ Â¦ - Â¦ Â¦

Along the line of the completed canal
between Oakland, and. Alameda there is
all kinds of evidence of money gone ' to
waste. Three costly bridges have been
built, two of- which are across dry land
and the third across an . uncompleted
canal. A ditch has been cut half-way
across the peninsula that connects Ala
meda and East Oakland. A right of way
for the canal' has been secured and con
tracts aggregating about $1,000,000 have
been completed. Â» The people are confront
ed â¢: with a, question of j spending, more
money to repair and undo the work that
has been done than It would cost to com
plete the- canal. : . .- . Â¦Â¦' V :
The first shovelful of earth moved for
the" canal was turned in 188S. The first
contract was foi $600,000, calling for the
removal- of earth from an area 400 feet
wide and 1000 feet In length, i The cut ex-
Considerable Work Already Done.
Then it was discovered that the Adams
heirs and those opposed to the tidal canal
had stolen a march on the tidal canal peo
ple. They had secured possession of
Chairman Burton of the House Rivers
and Harbors Oommittee, and he had held
up the contract in Washington. He vis
ited Oakland harbor with the . general
committee some months, ago, and went
back East without saying a word and
held up the Oakland harbor contracts
upon the ground that the canal is unneces
sary. Now there is consternation all
around. . :
last Republican Congressional fight. Con
gressman Victor H. Metcalf espoused the
cause of the tidal canal and Henry P.
Dalton was against it. ; This caused the
Adams heirs, who had always been bit
terly opposed to Dalton,- to side with him
as against Metcalf and politics and Oak
land club life were given a severe wrench
thereby. Metcalf won and the tidal canal
progressed so far that the contract for its
completion was let, approved in San Fran
cisco, the bridges. were built and the con
tractors, got their machinery on- the
ground. ,-, r
Oakland' harbor was begun it was de
cided'that, a tidal canal should be built
connecting San Leandro Bay with Oak
land harbor, upon, the theory that the
rush of _tldal waters from San Leandro
Bay through Oakland harbor would al
ways keep, that harbor scoured out and
clear. Â¦ As much as twenty years ago this
plan was opposed by the Oakland Water
Front Company, which- was simply the
Southern Pacific Company; under another
name, because that corporation wanted
all the money that was spent on Oakland
harbor to be spent upon that part of the
harbor that was, held, and controlled by
the Oakland Water Front Company.
. How the Battle Waged.
Of late years this fight has been re
newed ln the most determined manner
anu it has cut into politic? in many ways.
T'.ie Adams estate controls a system of
docks east of the Harrison-street bridge.
The Adams, estate has always opposed
the completion of the tidal canal because
It would diminish the value of its prop
erty and because it wanted the money
that was being used by the Federal Gov
ernment for the improvement of Oak
land harbor spent in front of its prop
erty. ' - â¢ ' - , Â¦
Then came the decision of the Supreme
Court which gave. to the city and to pri
vate claimants all of the water front
land in East Oakland. It became evident
to the Oakland Water Front Company,
which only controlled the water front of
Oakland city proper, under the decision
of the Supreme. Court, that the comple
tion of the tidal canal meant the develop
ment of the East Oakland portion of the
harbor, which It no loneer cantrolled. Â«*
Â¦ On ! top of this came the interests of
the city of Alameda. Thinking that the
tidal canal was to be completed the city
of Alameda provided for a sewer system
and partly constructed it, so that. the
completion of the tidal canal Is espoused
by the people, of Alameda for sanitary
as well as commercial reasons.

has been for the completion of the work
and has been the most earnest advocate
of the building of the canal and this is
what he said to-day in regard' to it:
If any member of the Oakland committee
protested against the completion of the tidal
canal It was an act of the grossest treachery.
It was wholly unauthorized and not in accord
ance wttiv. the general understanding: nor the
wish of the community. There was a specific
agreement on' this point between the public
bodies of Oakland and Alameda. and any at
tempt to cut the completion of the tidal canal
out or the plans for Â¦ improvement of the har

general aereement in regard to the Improve

of the City Council of Oakland and the com
mercial bodies of both Alameda and Oakland
Pursuant to that agreement, the first expendi
ture of the appropriation went to deepen the
channel to a minimum depth of twenty feet
The remainder was to eo toward the comple
tion of the canal. Acting: under the direction
of the public bodies of both cities. Senator
Perkins and myself have used our utmost en
deavors to have the contracts let and the work
proceeded with without further deisv This
agreement should be carried out ln good ralth

respected to the letter. Any representation to
the contrary is individual and treacherous
The ueocle of Alameda have cordially co

liberally toward the expense of receiving the

FEAST OF ST. IGNATIUS
OAKLAND, Aug. 2.â The old-time
fight over the Aiameda tidal ca
nal is again on in full force. Once
more Alameda County is being
Â¦\ rent in twain over this ditch.
Business and commercial circles are being
stirred- to the very bottom, political in
terests are being ruptured, the telegraph
wires are being worked night and day
and 100,000 people are agitated over the re
vival of this old specter.
It was thought that the tidal canal
question had been settled through the ef
forts of Congressman Victor H. Metcalf
at the last session of Congress. It had
been arranged that the canal should be
completed, money, was appropriated for
the work and even the contract was let
and the successful bidder put machinery
on the ground. The bridges were all built
and all that remained to be done was to
cut a few hundred feet of. earth away and
complete the canal. '. .
Suddenly it Is announced that the con
tracts are all held up, and it is discov
ered that Theodore C. Burton, chairman
of the House Rivers and Harbors Com
mittee, is the man who caused them to
be held up.
Telegrams have been flying to Wash
ington from all of tfee Federal officials
who live in Alameda County and who are
interested in the affairs of Oakland har
bor. This is the telegram that was sent
by Congressman Victor H. Metcalf:
SUXOL, July 19, 1901. 1
To Hon. EHhu Root, Secretary War: Ap
proval of contractor's bond for dredeins the"

â¢ The contract which Chairman Burton is
trying to hold up. calls for the removal of
1.370,000 cubic yards of earth at a cost of
19.74 cents per cubic yard, the total con
tract covering about $230,000, let to the At
lantic, Gulf and Pacific Company.
Now the whole question seems likely to
be reopened and the tidal canal will not
down in the commercial -and. political life
of Alameda County.
â¢ Another costly .improvement is that by
which . the waters from Sausal Creek
have been. diverted from running into the
canal. At a costof $50,000 this creek was
turned from . its course and now empties
into San Leandro Bay.
The first bridge across the canal was
built at Park.- street shortly after work
was finished on this section. It cost in
the neighborhood of $200,000, and Is one of
the biggest drawbridges in the State. It
has never been turned since it was built
and probably will have to be rebuilt be
fore it will turn, so rusted are the bear
ings. . Â¦ : ..
Two bridges have been built within the
last year, one at Fruitvale avenue and the
other at High street. Tho Fruitvale-ave
nue -bridge is a . combination wagbn and
railroad bridge and cost $55,000, to -which
must be added $40,000 paid to the Southern
Pacific Company for the i land occupied
byjt. It was built in anticipation of the
completion of the canal and the contrac
tors were compelled to dredge out a place
for the piers and foundations. This hole
is "now filled with stagnant water, refuse
and dead animals,' which adds to the'perii
of those living in the vicinity. The High
street bridge is a substantial structure
that cost the Government $100,000. It is
not surrounded by stagnant water, as it
is reached by the tides. .
First Bridge Across the Canal.
tended from the edge of the estuary 1000
feet across the peninsula. . : \
In the course of the work the dredging
machinery was submerged by the over
flowing of Saucal Creek, and the water
had to be pumped out at great cost. When
the work was finished the cut rapidly
filled with seepage water,* which soon be
came stagnant and bred disease. After
a struggle on the part of the health
authorities of Alameda the War Depart
ment was persuaded to connect the tidal
canal and the t-stuary by dredging out the
strip of land that separated them, the
object being to allow the tides to enter
the canal. The first cut was too small
for any practical use, and subsequently
was enlarged to the full width ] of the
canal at an expense of $100,000.
The canal and Brooklyn Basin, Into
which it empties, have become filled with
mud to such an extent now that they are
navigable only at high tide. This is due
to the sewage from Oakland and Alameda
which empties into the estuary. The in
flowing tides carry the sewage into the
canal, but are not strong enough to carry
it out again, allowing it to settle to the
bottom. It is the theory of the Govern
ment engineers that the weight of water
from San Leandro Bay, rushing through
the canal, will carry the sewage into the
bay The sewage matter is a menace to
the health of the city.

CARROLLTON, Miss., Aug. 2.â The air
has been rife with rumors of additional
lynchings all day, but in each case , the
reports have been without foundation. A
posse of men are scouring the country In
an effort to apprehend several negroes
suspected of complicity in the murder of
Mr. and Mrs. Taliaf erro on Tuesday night
last, but up to & o'clcok to-night no ar
rests have been made. The only persons
lynched in connection with the murder
were the three negroes taken from Jail
Wednesday night. Sheriff â¢Woodall stated
to-night that he had released all the negro
witnesses and that no further trouble was
anticipated. The town to-night is quiet.
Milton Hues, the father of the victim,
is a prominent grocer in Smlthville, and
the mob was composed almost entirely of
his relatives and friends. There were
about twenty-five in the mob. After the
execution of Davis the mob dispersed.
There is no danger of further trouble.
The Sheriff and one 'of his deputies and
a constable, i who were trying â¢ to prevent
the lynching, together with the father of
the defendant, were severely injured in a
clash with the crowd. The wounded offi
cers are:
Sheriff J. T. Odum, Deputy Bob Odum
and Constable Hanney Pass.
When the hearing began the defendant
introduced witnesses to attack the girl's
character.* The father had said that he
would not join or allow any violent meas
ures unless this action was taken by the
defendant. When the witness called be
gan to give' his testimony friends and rel
atives of the girl arose and made for the
prisoner. , For a time there was a wild
scene and the people became greatly ex
cited. Davis maae an ettort to. escape
irom the second story window of trie
courtroom, but several pistol shots were
fired in the crowd and he was captured
before, he could jump. He was taken a
quarter of a mile from town and hanged.
SMITHVILLE. Tenn., Aug. 2.â The first
lynching in De Kalb County took- place
this morning, when Charlie Davis, who
was charged with an assault on Miss Kate
Hues, was taken from the Courthouse by
a mob of about twenty-live friends and
relatives of the young woman and
hanged. The assault on Miss Hues was
made on last Sunday evening, and the
following morning Davis was taken before
a magistrate. He submitted his case and
the trial was set for to-day. *

"Professor Russell's remark that teach
ers spend their lives looking down needs
explanation. The Professor ought to be
careful of . his English. If inquiring into
the nature of children and the develop
ment of the child mind occurs to the Pro
fessor as one of belittling, he had better
get out of the business so that one man,
at least, may be saved for other work.
His argument that summer schools for the
training of teachers are in any sense a
remedy is ridiculous on the face of it."
"In the â¢ widest sense the Professor is
right. The business of teaching is not
broadly takenâ it is a step, to something
else, generally a makeshift. Some time
it may be different, when the public finds
that the teacher is important enough to
be well paid. At, present the ablest men,
men who would command large salaries
elsewhere, toil on for a lifetime with no
larger prospect than a $2000 salary, and
the certainty of being discarded just as
they would reach, in another profession,
their "highest usefulness."
P. M. Fisher, principal of the Central
High School, said: -.. . .
"When !Â¦ read Professor Russell's re
marks this morning I exclaimed, 'He has
hit the nail on the head.' But those re
marks must not be too literally construed.
And even so, they are not wholly as dam
aging as their author would seem to sup
pose. , Our teachers are narrow, but so
is everything that â¢ accomplishes results;
The broad mountain stream has to be nar
rowed down to a small focus before we
can use it in hydraulic engineering. In
another sense the teachers should be
broad â It should comprehend all the
other / professions. - Nothing gives such
prestige in the classroom. And when I
go about among our teachers' I feel that
compared with the members of other pro
fessions they are broad. They are in
creasingly so, too. Our teachers are com
ing to pursue an astonishingly wide range
of studies. Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦.'-. Â¦ .

months ago, and she was placed in the
care of Mrs. Annie Teager and her daugh

by her husband pending his return from
the East. It is believed Hogsdon is on
his way Here now, but his silence was in
terpreted by his wife to mean his death
or. disappearance.
The husband of the dead woman is Dan
iel B. Hogsdon, manager of a. railroad in
Guatemala, and he was expected to arrive
from New York yesterday. Mrs. Hogsdon
had expected him three weeks ago, and
when he did not arrive at the appointed
time she wrote a letter and addressed ?t
to him. In the letter, which was found in
her room yesterday by Deputy Coroner
Flynn, she complained to her friends that
she was very nfuch disappointed because
she had not heard from her husband and
feared that he had met. with an accident.
Her despondency increased day by day
until she 'found it necessary to consult a
physician concerning . her nervousness.

Boss Kelly Tries an Experiment With the Political Wind and Finds That
It Blows Him No Good.
Mrs. Davis said last night that she had
every faith in the girl, but her story of a
mysterious uncle and a stolen fortune is
regarded as a figment of her imagination.
Detective Lucas says the girl paid him
$5 to try and find a missing relative for
her. and that the statement that she had
paid him tSOO or that he had recovered
$40,000 worth of property for, her was ab
solutely false. Mr. and Mrs. Davis have
had the girl in their employ for three
monthF. She answered an advertisement
for help and was living at a downtown
hotel at that time. She claims that she
is an orphan and that she has traveled
extensively. The police will subject the
girl to a rigid investigation to-day. The
first intimation that the neighbors of Mr.
and Mrs. Davis had of the alleged rob
bery was when the servant girl put her
head out of the window and called for
help.
Last week ehe informed Mrs. Davis that
Detective A. E. Lucas < had located her
"uncle" and '"recovered all the property
for her." Â¦ r â
Pauline de Vore told Mr. and Mrs. Davis
a strange tale, when she took service with
them. She said she had come from Den
ver Trith $900 in ter possession to locate
an uncle who was practicing medicine in
Ean Francisco \under an assumed name
and who was in possession of property be
longing to her valued at $40,000. . Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦
There appears to be good ground for
suspecting that the girl's account of the
burglary may have to be amended. Al
though she said that the burglar, grasped
her arm and neck, not a sign of a bruise
could be found on her arm or neck, and
further investigation may develop some
surprises. "Â¦.'.-.. ?Â£':*Â¦â¢.; '.~i7.'<-/
The girl told a carefully detailed story
to the police and described the burglar
as a tall, heavy built man. about 30 years
old, with light blue eyes and a heavy
mustache that looked false.
The servant girl with the aristocratic
name told the police that at 9 p. m. ihe
door bell: rang and that through the
speaking tube a message came that a
messenger was there with a parcel. The
girl said that she opened the door and
that a- man came up the stairs and' put
a big pistol to her head and told her not
to scream. Then Fhe says the man took
hold of her arm and dragged her into the
bedroom of Mrs. Davis, where he stole a
quantity of silverware out of a trunk and
also a set of diamond Etuds. The pirl
taid she tried to run into her room but
fainted In the hallway and when she came
to her senses the alleged burglar had van
ished and the house had been ransacked.
Mr. and ilrs. Davis went to the theater
Jast evening, lea\1ng the servant girl in
charg* of the second story flat they oc
cupy. When they jeturned from the the
ater they found the police in charce of
the house and listened to a wild tale of a
bold man with a big pistol who had ran
sacked the premises and carried off all
the valuables.
The police were called upon last evening
to Investigate an Â¦. alleged burglary and
hold-up that Pauline de Vore, a servant
girl employed at the residence of YV.

Bradford insisted that Abe Reuf had his
"raws, on the delegation," but laughter
was his reward. â¢ Â¦ ' . .
Attorney Sanford Feigenbaum Â¦ made a
good speech defending himself from the
attacks of Frank, and caused - that gen
tleman to squirm when,* in answer to
Felgenbaum's â¢ demand, . Frank was- com
pelled to admit that he only opposed him
because he was a new- member of the
club. Feigenbaum brought down , the
house when he- dramatically informed
Frank that "no one could say he (Feigen
baum), wore the collar of a boss." . â¢
All kinds of tactics were resorted to by
the Grand Hotel faction in trying to stave
off a vote on the adoption of the list of
selected delegates. A motion to adopt the
minority report was voted down and the
roll call was demanded. This was de
feated, despite the .presence of stuffers
on the floor. Then the presence of the
stuffers was detected and they were given
orders^ to leave the room.
A motion to adopt the majority, report
was carried by an overwhelming major
ity, but again the roll call was adopted:
In order to conciliate, the disgruntled rep
resentatives of the Crimmins-Kelly crowd j
enough members voted , to allow the roll
to be called. Again the motion to adopt
the report of the executive committee pre
vailed and the boss element ; was finally
defeated. ' ,

when he stated. that Irving had/admitted
that his (Brandt's) traducer was Alec
Truman,' who Brandt declared was a "po
litical mounteback." Â¦
, E. Pistoles! took exception to the per
sonal remarks of*. Frank and Irving and
called them to account for attacking the
press which . was helping In the fight
against the bosses. Wallace Bradford ac
cused Pistolesi of having run as an inde
pendent candidate for the Assembly at
the instigation of Dibble.' Pistolesi made
a rapid-fire speech, in which the words
"lie" and "liar" were frequently used.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 1.â The one-man
pow'er which 'dominates the affairs of the
State government under the Gage regime
has found another manifestation in the
appointment by Daniel Kevane, . secre
tary of the State Board of Examiners, of
Frank E. Smith as copy-holder for the
State Printer, although the appointive
power under the law resta with, the State
Printer himself.
When Smith called at the State Control
ler's office for his -July salarryhe was in
formed that he could not get It, since
no notice of his appointment had been filed
with that office. It appeared that the
appointment had been made by Kevane,
and Deputy Controller Douglas pointed
out that Kevane had no more right to ap
point the copy-holder than he had to ap
point a deputy In the Attorney General' 3
office. Subsequently State Printer John
son signed a notice of Smith's appoint
ment, which bears tha letterhead of the
Board of Examiners. Johnson said he fa
vored Smith himself, but the Controller de
clined to recognize the authority of Ke
vane in the premises. Smith is the secre
tary of the local Council of Federated
Trades, and while personally Â¦ acceptable
for the place, his selection by Kevane is
thought to be in the Interest of Gage's
political plans. . â¢

Brandt Jumped to his feet and a wordy
war ensued between him and Frank and
Irving. President Davis was obliged to
frequently use the gavel - and call ' the
speakers to order. Brandt defended : his
Mr. Frank brought in a minority, report
and accused those who signed the ma
jority report of having Juggled and played
at politics. Frank's report. asked that S.
C. Irving and John Millword be substi
tuted on the list of delegates for Morris
Brandt and Sanford Felgenbaum.' Frank
then made a bitter attack on Brandt and
accused him of having sold out the: club
a year ago and, voted with the bosses
when on the County Committee. He also
attacked the press for saying that he and
Irving were trying to capture the club for
the Grand Hotel element. .
The resort of the executive committee
was read by Sheldon G. Kellogg and waa
to the effect that no change should be
made in the list of delegates submitted at
the previous meeting of the club; and that
the charges made against certain dele
gates had absolutely no foundation.,.'
President Horace Davis, In calling the
meeting to order, stated that the principal
business to be transacted was the adop
tion of the report of the executive com
mittee of delegates selected for the com
ing municipal primary election. Nathan
Frank, who worked I hard for . the Grand
Hotel faction, moved that the meeting.be
executive, and was aided by S. C. Irving,
but the vote showed a .unanimous desire
that the proceedings should not' be secret.
One hundred and seven members of the
club were present, while a number of
stuffers from the Dibble faction took part
in the proceedings- until they were with
scant ceremony banished from the floor
of the hall.
Politicians who are being used to â¢ do
the work of Kelly and Crimmins In the
Forty-first Assembly District were com
pletely routed last night at the meeting
of the- Central Republican Club in Lodge
Hall, 1605 Polk street.
Forty -First District.
Many citizens who went to the office of
the Registrar of Voters between 6 and 7
o'clock last .evening for the purpose of
registering for the primary election found
the place closed. A sign on the door gave
the information that the office would be
open again at 7:30 -o'clock. The attention
of the Election Commissioners and the
Registrar of Voters is called to this ob
vious neglect of public duty on 'the part
of some of the paid employes of the city.
Information Is given that the office will
be open to-day until 11 o'clock p. m.
There should be no suspension of work
to-day until the hour appointed for the
closing of registration for the primary
election. Citizens have rights which the
Election Commissioners and the Registrar
are bound to respect.
The directors of the Republican Primary
League are confident of success. The
league will put forward a straight anti
boss ticket in every Assembly district.
Measures will be taken at the proper time
to place a league ticket in the hands of
every registered Republican voter. It is
calculated in advance that the bosses will
employ all their cunning and dexterity to
mislead voters by circulating boss tickets
under Independent and anti-boss inscrip
tions, but proper steps will be taken in
ample time to protect the voters from, im
position.
Recent movements signify that the al
lied bosses are planning for a strong fight
in the Forty-first and Forty-fourth As
sembly districts. The large number of
transfers to the Forty-fourth District re
corded recently at the Registration Office
excites suspicion. The Registrar of Vo
ters and the Election Commissioners | are
on their guard and fraudulent voting will
be detected. The Republican bosses are
no doubt planning with the Democratic
push for an invasion of both districts.
Primary League Tickets.
The allied bosses confess defeat in ad
vance by refusing an open fight in the dis
tricts. They are bending all their efforts
in secret work to gain by compromise
scattering delegates. Underhanded and
unprincipled political methods are resort
ed to in order to mislead independent
clubs. ;Â¦# :â¢:
in opposition to the allied bosses.
Kelly, Gage, CrimminE, Herrin and their
followers from the interior are losing
ground. The indorsement of the Kelly-
Crimmlns County Committee by the Re
publican State organization has ' had an
effect just the reverse of that desired by
the. meddlesome gang of outside politi
cians. Republican citizens refuse to rec
ognize the so-called Tllden committee,
which the State body foolishly indorsed.
The blight ol bossism is on the commit
tee.
THE Republican Primary League
continues to render splendid serv
ice in the direction of uniting all
