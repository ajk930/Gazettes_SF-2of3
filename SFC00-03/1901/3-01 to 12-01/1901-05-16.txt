Mrs. McKinley has been in frail health for many years, and while the slight \imppoyemeht in her/Condition reported yesterday means much in her
case, the attending physicians do not dare to prognosticateÂ» "
The President has been overwhelmed with telegrams from the various States, cities and towns he was ( to have visited after leaving San Fran
cisco. The residents of al! these localities, while disappointed in not having a i chance to welcome the President, express the deepest sympathy for
him and for his wife, and are willing to forego everything for thfe sake of the Chief Executive and his^stricken helpmate".
The President will not take part in the launching of tlie battleship Ohio, and the Knights^Templar, having learned his wishes, will abandon their
proposed parade. ,
Affairs of state will be attended to by the head of the nation, but public and social functions will be cast aside in order that the President may be
close to his beloved wife in the hour of her affliction. '

social portion of the visit of
the President's p,arty to Oak
land took place at Palm
Knoll, the beautiful home of
Senator George C." Perkins.
This ' served as a pleasant
break in the drive to Oakland and a point
where the Oakland committee of arrange
ments and 'the. ladles 'of the Senator's
household and the committee could meet
the distinguished visitors. *
â The President's party arrived at the
home of Senator Perkins promptly, at 2:43.
Long "bef oro that hour, however, the
streets surrounding. Palm Knoll were
thronged with people, hoping to the very
last that the President might come. '. In
spite of the general disappointmejit, how
ever. Secretary Hay and Â¦ those : ' accom
panying him received a most . cordial
greeting from the assembled multitude
without the gates and a welcome from
Senator Perkins and those gathered un
der Ms roof that was typical of Califor
nian hospitality. At the threshold the
noted visitors were introduced by the
Berkeley committee to the Oakland re
ception committee, >who from that moment
became responsible for the entertainment
of the honored guests. Senator Perkins In
troduced the party to Mayor Barstow and
Edson 1 F. . Adams, who, after a courteous
interchange of compliments and greeting,
performed the same agreeable â¢ task for
the large assemblage of representative
citizens who had been Invited to meet the
distinguished visitors.
. The wives of nearly all the reception
committee were present,' as well as many
of Miss Perkins* young friends, who- had
been Invited to receive with her. Aalda
from the . disappointment of not meeting
President McKinley, the reception was a
most enjoyable affair. Eleararrt gowns)

Hay was much Interested and said:
â¢'So you have something always here, on
tho Veraon Heights of Oakland, to remind
you of the great man who rests at that
other Mount Vernal far away."
After the reception the party re-entered
their carriages to be driven through Oak
land.
The decorations of Palm Knoll wera
tasteful In the extreme. Over the wida
entrance a large silken flag- was draped
and signal flags of the marine servlc*
were arranged to form words of welcome.
A large picture of the President over the
portico waa draped with the national col
ors and flags fluttered gaily everywhere
A white canvas had been laid from tho
doorway to the carriage* drive and was
outlined on either side with large growing
plants of maidenhair fern. 'Within great
quantities of roses and carnations, reef and
white, and lilies were . artlstlcallv ar
ranged about the handsomely furnished
apartments. In the billiard room cham

Colonel . Irish agreed to go to the .Scott
residence, where the President is staying,
and see if eome time, no matter how
short, could not be given to Oakland.
Colonel- Irish went to San Francisco, con
elilted with the members of , the 'Presi
dent's party and used â¢ every effort to
bring the President here, even if only for
a few moments. But the President did
not feel that he could leave his wife's

fret that ha was compelled to disappoint;

Mission Is Futile.
Edson F. Adams, the chairman of. the
general committee, enlisted the interest of
OAKLAND, May 15.â For the
second time Oakland has
been disappointed in its ex :
pectation of an opportunity
to greet the nation's Presi
dent. # For the second time
special arrangements have
been made and for the second time the
President did not come, to the great dis
appointment of the loyal citizens.
The first disappointment was ten years
ago when President Harrison made his
rush through Oakland and In the midst of
the parade ordered his driver to bolt the
line and leave at once for San Francisco,
declining to appear before the thousands
who had come to greet him. ...
The circumstances surrounding the In
ability of President William McKinley to
visit Oakland were vastly different, and
while the people were disappointed there
waa coupled with that disappointment
sincere regret at the illness of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley* that prevented the visit.
Word reached Oakland early that Mrs.
McKinley was worse and that the Presi
dent would not be able to come either to
Berkeley or Oakland. The Oakland* citi
zens were eo anxious to have the Presi
dent come to this city, even if only for a
few moments, that they sent a special
delegation to San Francisco to see if he
could ( not be prevailed upon to come to
Oakland for half an hour and drive about
the decorated (streets.
Oakland he felt that he could not leave
Mrs. McKinley.
And bo Colonel Irish returned to Oak
land with the news that the President's
presence was impossible. â¢ â¢' -â¢â¢ : ''
It was decided to carry out the - pro
gramme as originally planned and allow
the Presidential party,to see Oakland and
meet a few of its citizens. This was dpne,
and it showed how perfect had been lthÂ«
arrangements for handling: the party and
the crowds. The crowds were 'great and
the day was perfect, * and everything
seemed to have arranged Itself for a tre
mendous celebration. It\ would have been
the largest and most memorable demon
stration that ever took place In Oakland
had it not been for the- absence of the
President. \

I The trir> from Berkeley was accom
plished without Incident. The visitors
were guided by Chief of Police Hodgkina
of Oakland In person. The arrival at Sen
ator Perkins* residence was practically on
time. There the stay was carefully timed
and the trip through the^streeta of Oak
land and to the High School was made
with the loss of but a few minutes. The
speeches at the High School were only
those of regret at the absence of the Pres
ident.
â¢"Infantry Escort Delayed.
The only hitch was In the late arrival
of two companies of the Eleventh Infan
try. â¢ ' They were sent over - on the . Mc-
Dowell. The captain sot out of the chan
nel and stuck in the mud, and the de
tachment had to meet the party en route.
They tried to find their way about the
streets of Oakland and got lost, but they
joined the party Â¦â¢ before It " reached the
High School. .
The decorations were excellent, despite
the failure ' of the : original contractor to
carry out his agreements. By extra ef
forts the committees secured enough out
side help 'to overcome the â¢ handicap, and
Oakland presented . a very gay . appear
ance. The arrangements Â¦ for the : recep
tion were excellent and the work of the
general, committee and the sub-commit
tees proved most satisfactory. â¢â¢ The po
licing of the city was well done, consider

OAKLAND, May 15.â The pub
lic school children made a
brave showing in spite of
the report that the President
would not be able to take
part in the parade. Many of
â¢ the knowing ones stayed at
hoi_o, but there were other thousands
along the. line of march, gay with color
and enthusiastically waving their flags,
serenely confident that their cheers were
reaching McKinley's ears. The consensus
of opinion among the small tots appeared
to be that the gentleman wearing the
cocked hat and numerous medals must be
the President. *
Each pupil was given a small flag by his
or her teacher. They were stationed by
schools along the route of the procession
from Nineteenth and Webster to Thir
teenth and Jackson. All along the curb
they stood Â«nd overflowed upon the
lawns on either" side of the street. The
high wall around the Beldcn place at
Nineteenth and Jackson was packed with
the children from the Durant and Cole
schools, who viewed the procession from
a point of vantage. Â¦â¢'..'â¢Â¦
Grouped by Schools.
The children were grouped in .the fol
lowing order, beginning with the most
southerly school on Jackson street: Bay
School; on the west side of Jackson near
Thirteenth; north of the Bay School the
Peralta School, next the Temescal School
and next tho Piedmont. Opposite the
Piedmont was the Prescott School and
from there to the end of the street at
Nineteenth were the Franklin," Swett,
Garfleld and Lincoln schools in the order
named. Around the corner on -the north
side 'of Nineteenth street -followed the
Lafayette, tho Tompklns and Grove Street
schools' in that order.'.
Next to the Piedmont School on the
west side of Jackson street was the Har
rison School contingent; next the Clawaon
and the Durant children at the corner of

side of Nineteenth street the Cole and
Grant schools. ' Â¦

The committee's arrangements at the
High School were perfect. The streets ad
jacent to the building were blockaded and
the policing of the big crowds which
gathered about the structure was' excel
lent. The military and naval escort to the
visiting members of the Cabinet and the
remainder of the Presidential â¢ party was
drawn up on Twelfth street facing the

It is a source of profound , regret to all of
us that the President Is unable to be here.
No one - can - stand In : his place or represent

with love, affection Â¦ and devotion as he stands
by the bedside of his beloved and invalid wife.
The cordiality . and loyalty you show ! in your

The entrance of the Mayor with the
Secretary and - the committee upon the
large speakers' stand, was a signal for an
outburst of cheering and applause from
the great crowd that was packed into* the
court an<\ backed upon Lafayette Square.
. There were 6000 or 7000 people who as
sembled at the park and in spite of the
absence of the President- there .was a
goodly show of enthusiasm as the Sec

people. .
The speakers' stand and the platform
were covered with evergreens and ropes
of roses/ Overhead were strung to a cen

of red, white and blue" bunting, the whole
producing a pleasing effect. -.
The gathering crowd was regaled with

Ralph Talcott Fisher. College of Letters,
expounded "The Unification of University
Ideals." He traced the progress of uni

of a university had broadened and pro

the improvement in educational methods.
CROWDS GREET CABINET OFFICERS
The historical spirit is equally demanded by
the national problems of to-day. . Academic
training in history may not be essential to it,
but such training should greatly stimulate and
develop it. And If the imprint of the univer
sity course is to be anything more than a
mTe ornament, a badge of knighthood, u coat
of arms, it must stimulate and develop the
historical spirit. It must send out men, both
as leaders and as citizens, not with overload
ed memories, but with keen Insight and trained
Judgment. National questions are demanding
these qualities with ever Increasing force.
That demand is being met more and more by
college men. President Schurman, Professor
Moses and Professor Worcester, on the Philip
pine Commissions, are prophetic of the part
that the university is to play In solving the
problems which this country must face. They
are prophetic as showing that the discipline
of the university in historical method can
e^ulp men with the insight, the sound Judg
ment, the searching historical spirit which
such problems demand. .
On the "Historical Spirit in Practical
Politics" "W. B. Greeley of the College of
Social Sciences had this to say by way of
conclusion:

Nathan M. Moran of the College of Let

his theme. Summing up he said: \
Democracy in Education.
The opportunity of the lawyer does not cease
with his public relations. He has a still great
er duty, a heavier responsibility; and that Is
the protection of the rights of the individual.
When the lawyer accepts the case of his client,
the trust reposed in him presumes that he
has the necessary knowledge, the skill and
ability to counsel his client and- prosecute his
couse so that the ends of justice may be sub
served. It is this phase of the lawyer's re
lation to society that necessitates the placing
of safeguards around the- profession. It la
this phase wherein the lawyer may become
the instrument to right the wrong that has
been done. It Is this phase, I say, that has
caused men to accord to the profession of the
law such profound respect, such dignified in
fluence during centuries past.
Everett J. Brown, representing Hast
ings Law School, spoke of the training
and opportunity of the law-school grad
uate. He said in part:
Addresses by Students.
By authority vested in me by the Regents
of the Univereity of California I confer the
degTee of -doctor of laws' upon William Mc-
Kinley. President of the United States, a
statesman singularly gifted to unite the dis
cordant forces of government and mold the
diverse purposes of men toward progressive
and salutary action; a magistrate whose poise
of Judgment has been tested and vindicated
in a succession of national emergencies; gcod
citizen, brave soldier, wise executive, helper
and leader of men, exemplar to his people of
the virtues that build and conserve the fctate,
society and the home.
But there was onÂ© other Incident that
distinguishes this commencement. Upon
William McKinley, President of the Unit
ed States, Benjamin Ide "Wheeler, presi
dent of the University of California, con
ferred the degree of doctor of laws. The
investment of this new honor came with
the following declaration by the college
president:
Then came the slow and tedious, but
"whereof commencements are born," the
distribution of commissions to the mili
tary prize winners by Governor Gage and
the conferring of degrees, and the award
ing of the university medal to Wesley
Newcomb Hohfeld by President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler. â¢".-'.
As he took his seat Secretary Hay re
ceived a second ovation even more pro
nounced and more enthusiastic than the
first. The disappointment of the student
body had lost its edge and they were will

appreciation of pne whose position is

In person, he had lone looked forward to the

serious condition of Mrs. McKlnley's health

therefore, to covne in his stead and express his
profound feeling of sorrow and disappointment
that he -f^s not able to be with you.
I car well appreciate your feelings of dis

And yet the beauty o' California Is not that
fatal gift which was sung by Fllicaja In words
cf mere melody and bitterness than, perhaps,
ever before were compressed into fourteen lines
cf literature. The beauty of California, instead
at being an element of weakness, as that of
Italy wee to her, la r.n element of strength

that of a peasant which attracts the notice of
a marching soldier. This great State, a power

A preat present is yours: a. vaster future
twaits you.
Secretary Hay delivered in easy style an
eddress that Is well worth the reading.
No attempt at oratory was made. The
speech was not a spontaneous one. but It
was strong, simple and forceful. He said:
Address to the Students.
The announcement was greeted with a
burst 9it applause ;t-at caused the atmos
phere to vibrate and the leaves on the
shadowing trees to flutter as in a summer
breeze.
"Mr. President of the University of the
State of California, and Students of the
University, Ladies and Gentlemen: We
may well congratulate ourselves upon the
fact that we have here with us to-day
our Illustrious visitors. I now have the
very great pleasure of introducing to you
His Excellency, John Hay, the Secretary
cf State."
The "compliment extern" was acknowl
edged graciously by the Secretary of State
and then the regular business of a com
mencement day was installed. Four ad
dresses by the students followed In quick
order. Everett John Brown, Ph. B., of
the Hastings College of Law, spoke of
"The Law School Graduate â His Training
and Opportunity." The theme of "Democ
racy in Education" was expounded by
Nathan Montgomery Moran; "The Unifi
cation of University Ideals," by Rajph
Talcott Fisher, and "The Historical Spirit
in Practical Politics," by William Buck
out Greeley.
Secretary Hay was presented by Gov
ernor Gage In the following words:
Soon after Secretary of State Hay took
his seat the student rooters set up a
mighty shout, the first burst of enthusi
asm that rolled out from the leathern
throated rooters.
Secretary Hay Is- Presented.
But despite the fact that President Mc-
Klnley did not attend the commencement
exercises this event will long hold a place
in the memory of those who were present.
The cinder path had been transformed
Into a stadium constructed on the old
Greek plan. A stage, wide and made up
of a central part and two arms slightly
diverging, ran along the east side. Here
the regents, faculty, and graduating
students, lawyers, dentists and pharma
cists, all in gowns and mortar-boards,
were placed. The very front row of the
left side was occupied by the guests of
honor: Horace Davis, Mrs. Hay, Post
master General Charles Emory Smith and
wife. Secretary Long:, Lieutenant Com
mander Phelps, Secretary Wilson, Miss
"Wilson and Mr. Moore. The center stage,
over which was hung a canvas canopy
decorated in national colors, followed out
the architectural idea of the Greek sta-,
(]ium. In contradistinction to the somber
and austere black of the regents, pro
fessors and the students who were about
to be launched on life's highway, were the
colored caps end ribbons of the under
graduates and the spring millinery of the
women who made up tae major part of
the audience. The sun was not "shining,

According to a careful estimate the seat

Then the full realization that President

part in the exercises swept over the con

official representative.
The Presidential party came upon the
platform quietly and unobtrusively and
before the assemblage realized that what
it was anxiously awaiting, the coming of
the President, would not be, the exercises
were begun with a prayer by Bishop
Nichols.

about a hundred years ago we had r a -.great
wilderness where Ohio exists." The men who
fought the battles or the revolution concluded
that they would expand and they . took pos

up the great State which we. have, there. Now
as I have come across your plains and over
your mountains and finally reached the : PaÂ«
clfic Coast I found that their doctrines have
expanded until they have taken possession of
all this glorious Western country. The mere
fact that we- are ahd have been expansionists
has made our nation front and strong and if
we follow the same ideas and carry out the
eame policies the nation will continue to grow
in power and strength in all the years to come
as it has done in the past. (Applause.)
My friends, I am rejuiced to see the wonder

watched with interest your great industries, I

which has rejoiced my heart more, than all

Senors Gomez and Sllvela are strongly

report interprets the explanations of Sec

that clauses will be added guaranteeing

the third clause will be stricken out as
the Monroe doctrine provides for Inter

Visiting Ohioans Are Taken Through the
Oriental 'Quarter by Police Officers Spe
cially Detailed by Chief of Police Sullivan
THE visiting Congressmen and
their wives were afforded an ex
cellent opportunity yesterday of
viewing the beautiful scenery in
Golden Gate Park, with a
glimpse of the broad Pacific, a
view of the Seal Roclis and
Cliff House and a chance to observe the
magnificent fortifications of the harbor of
San Francisco.
The members of the pa,rty were unani
mous in declaring the drive a feature of
their visit, which they would long remem
ber, and were loud in their praise of the
commercial committee, which had the trip
in charge.
The party consisted of fifty ladies and
gentlemen and filled comfortably five
tallyho coaches. A start was made from
the Pleasanton Hotel shortly after 9
o'clock and the route taken was to Golden
Gate avenue, along that thoroughfare to
I>evisaxJero street, thence to the pan
har-dle.
The horses were permitted to walk
through the park to allow the visitors a
full leisurely view of nature in all her
loveliness, such as can only be obtained in
Golden Gate Park.
Delighted "With Park's Beauty.
The visitors were enraptured and spoke
freely of the wondrous sight. Their senti
ments were expressed by one of the
party, who said enthusiastically:
"San Francisco should be proud of her
park; Jt is most wonderful."
The visitors were taken to the conser
vatory, where a stop was made to enable
them to view the beautiful floral speci
mens. They were escorted through the
conservatory and then shown the beauti
ful floral designs laid cut In honor of the
President ajid the Eastern visitors.
The new music stand was the next point
of interest visited and from there the
party was driven to the buffalo paddock.
Some time was spent In admiring the
Immense bisons and the drive was then
continued to the deer park. The ladles of
the party spent some time gazing upon
the gentle creatures confined within the
park and when the young ones of the
herd came to the fence encircling the
place set apart for them they patted their
heads, touched their . cold noses and
searched diligently for stray scraps of
food with which to feed them.
First Glimpse of the Pacific.
Fiom the deer park the drive to th.3
Cliff along the Qcean road was a source
of much pleasure to the lawmakers and
the ladies. It was the first glimpse of
the bread Pacific many of them had had
and words failed them when they sought
to express their delight. "Grand," "Glor
ious," they cried In ecstatic chorus.
At the Cliff House the visitors were
met by mine host Wllkins and escorted
to the baJcony overlooking- the ocean and
the Seal Rocks.
The ladies of the party were partlcu-.
larly Interested in the famous seals. It
seemed almost as If the animals expected
the distinguished guests and had deter
mined to "show off." They barked and
roared and swam, about the rocks, hold
ing the attention of the party until Con
gressman Kahn reminded the deeply In
terested visitors that a visit to Sutro
Baths and Museum was proposed. After
viewing the baths and museum the party
returned to the Cliff House and were es
corted to the banquet room, where lunch-

which was arranged in horseshoe shape,
presented a superb spectacle. The lunch
eon was all that could be desired and was
thoroughly enjoyed by the visitors, whose
appetites had been sharpened by the drive
in the bracing- breezes from the ocean.
Taken Through Presidio.
Captain Eugene T. "Wilson, aid to Gen
eral Shafter. assumed charge of the party
after the -luncheon and directed their
movement* toward the Presidio. The bat
teries alonff the shore were pointed out
and the position and manner of working

The well kept avenues of the military
reservation were driven over and the
points of interest along the drives indi

Riches of California.
California' with her twelve hundred miles of
seaboard following the indentations of the coast,
her magnificent deep-water harbors, her moun
tains bursting: with the rarest minerals and
metals^ her hillsides crowned with timber that
the world cannot equal, the long reaches of her
plains, prodigally rich and fertile, her orchards,
her vineyards, her olive groves and oil fields â
these wonderful natural resources must very
soon build up an empire on the Pacific Slope
that shall surpass in power and opulence the
fabled kingdom of Cathay dreamed of by Marco
Polo and Columbus.
All that California needed to bring her forth
and place her in that high position which is her
heritage was van opportunity. The election of
President McKFnley in 1S96, the passage of the
Dingley bill, the sound-money policy, the Span
ish war, the annexation of the Hawaiian
'Islands, the acquisition of the Philippines â in
fact, the policy of the present administration
brought to us our golden opportunity. ' ,
And. behold the gates of the Pacific have
spread wide and- ships from California- ports
go forth to all the Oriental world freighted
down- with the products of the shops and farms
and factories of America. Those same ships
return again to California ports laden with the
riches of other lands. Our mines of gold and
silver and copper pcur out an ever augmented
stream of wealth. Â¦
Thi3 is our proud position to-day, and the 500
members of the Union League Club, represent
ing almost every trade, profession and business
known In our State, confident in the unbounded
possibilities of the future, gladly welcome the
men from Ohio. We welcome the chief execu
tive Â»f that mighty commonwealth who is
our guest to-night, because he represents in
his State the idea of government that has
brought so much to Californiaâ because he has
honored us by traveling across the continent
to do us the great ' honor of Â¦ witnessing the
launching of the great vessel that some event
ful day In the' future may bear the flag of
the nation and Ohio's name in triumph through
the battle and the storm, but was fashioned
by the hands of California workmen. We wel
come Ohio's Governor, because Ohio and Cali
fornia must keep step In unison â¢ in building
up and defending the Americans nation.
- We welcome the Congressmen of Â¦ Ohioâ they
have been loyal, faithful and true to- the best
interests of the republicâ they have given their
time and their energies to working out : the
problems ' of State and solving them aright, 'Â¦
the correct solution of which must determine
our nation's destiny for good or ill. They

deht, upheld his hand and supported most
faithfully his grand administrationâ and- , one

At the conclusion of Mr. McKlnlay's pa
triotic address there was a wave of ap
plause. Governor. Nash was then intro
duced. When the hearty and prolonged
applause which greeted his Introduction
subsided the Governor of Ohio said Â¦ :â¢
Mr. President and gentlemen of the Union
League Club: I hardly know how to express
the gratitude which I feel for the very cordial
welcome which you have given me to-night.
We have come some 2500 miles for the purpose
of being with you and launching that splendid
battleship which your workmen have construct
ed, the Ohio. We feel that in doing this we
have come upon a patriotic mission, and we
are glad to be so cordially greeted by all the
citizens of your . splendid State. > -. â¢ . Â¦â¢ ..-â¢-.
I must confess that this Journey has been a
sort of eye-opener for me. (Laughter.) 1 1 have
never been a member of : Congress, I. have
never been a candidate for President, and my
vision' has been somewhat circumscribed. ; (Re
newed laughter.) I formerly had the idea that
all the great men came from â¢ Ohio | (great
laughter), and that nearly all of ' the good
things in this world had their life and being
in that- State (renewed laughter). ~ In this I
have, within the laet ten days, discovered that
I have .been' wonderfully -mistaken. I find the
same prosperity, the same love for the, repub
lic, and the same love for . pur â¢ flag existing
upon the Pacific Coast that exists in the Cen
tral States. I feel ! assured from what I have
seen and heard that th& 'men of .California
are Just as loyal. Just . as patriotic , and' Just
as ready to ? defend - our .; republic in; time of
danger as any men upon the continent. I (Ap

THE Union League Club received
eminent guests last evening. The
assembled statesmen and sol
diers listened to sweet music
and words expressing eloquent
sentiments of national and State
pride. The Governor of Ohio ex
alted the Buckeyes, the Governor of Ore
gon paid a tribute to Oregonlans, and the
Governor of California held aloft the ban
ner of the Golden State. The club rooms
in honor of the event were beautifully
garlanded with glllax leaves from Berke
ley and roses from Santa Rosa. The occa
sion was a reception tendered by the
league to George K. Nash, Governor of
Ohio', and visiting Congressmen from that
State. The exercises were managed by a
committee consisting of William M. Ab
bott, chairman; A. G. Booth, M.- H. de
Young, Joseph S. Spear Jr., S. J. Hendy,
J. B. Fuller and F. A. Vail. , - N
Shortly after 9 o'clock Governor Nash of
Ohio, Governor Geer of Oregon and visit
ing Congressmen were escorted to a plat
form on the east side of the main room.
Escort duty was performed by J. M.
Gleaves,' William M. Abbott, Charles L..
Field, J. B. Fuller, H. D. Loveland, H. G.
W. Dinkelsplel, S. J. Hendy, F. A." Vail
and the uniformed' generals and colonels
belonging to the respective staffs, of the
Governors of Ohio, Oregon and California.
Major General Shatter. United States
army, sat among the elect on the plat
form. Governor Gage was not present at
the beginning of the exercises, but arrived
at 10 o'clock. He was received with gen-*
erous applause and . cordially greeted by
George D. Clark, president of the league.
MCcKinlay Welcomes the Guests, '.
According to programme George D.
Clark, president of the club, claimed the
attention of the audience and introduced
D. E. McKinlay, the speaker appointed to
welcome â¢ the visitors. Mr. McKinlay
speaking for the league said: -
The magnificent series of receptions and ova
tions tendered by the patriotic and enthusias
tic citizens of California to the nation's chief
executive and to the many distinguished men
and women of the East who have become our _,
guests within the last few days Bhows the
deep feeling of appreciation prevailing through
out the State for the honor conferred upon
us by their presence in our midst. ; Â¦'
California, San Francisco., the Union League
Club, may well mark the time of these oc
currences with a white stone. It is not very
of ten that Callfornlans, living away out here
in the center of the American nation, have
an opportunity at one single time to meet and
greet and welcome so many of the great men
of the extreme East -/ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .'.'Â¦'
I allude to California as the center of the
Union because we claim that we are West
erners no longer. . We hall now from the cen
ter of the great republic. '. Â¦';
The star of empire, always guiding and beck
oning civilization and progress westward,
reached over the mountains and rivers and
valleys of broad America, over the islands of
the Pacific Ocean, onward, and still onward,
until at last the emblem of American national
ityâthe flag, which is the hope of all who look
for libertyâ the flag which is the pride and best
love of every true and loyal American heart
floats In honor and. glory in the gates of the
East and spreads its radiance over the Ori
ental skies.
Alive to Its Significance.
And California Is alive to the Significance
of the hour, to the boundless possibilities of.
her near future, and she welcomes with -glad'
rejoicing the glorious day foretold by the
prophetic tongue of Seward In 1846, who said:
"Our population Is destined to roll Its resist
less waves to the Icy barriers of the north
and encounter Oriental â¢ civilization oh - the
chores of the Pacific." '
â¢ The day has comeâ the prophecy Is | fulfllled.
California Is no longer an isolated segment of
the great American republic. She Is no longer
an almost unknown and little estimated part of
the territory of the United States, away off over
the backbone of the continent on the very, fringe
of American civilization, ;. ;.-. _ , . ,
She has evolved from that, situation of com
parative insignificance.- The series of, great
events in which. our nation has been engaged
in the last four years has changed the position
of California I In its relation to the Eastern
States and the outside world as well.. And to
day wo feel that by reason -of this change .we
are -to be placed in the- forefront of Â¦ the great
operations in ' trade,' In ' manufacturing- 'and in
DAY'S' SIGHT-SEEING OF CONGRESSMEN AND RECEPTION TO GOV.NASH.
4the success of that service depends on your
good work. (Applause.) I know, gentlemen,
that I shall go back ,to my post of duty in
Washington with renewed strength and zeal
for my associations with these representatives
gathered here on this far Pacific Coast, and
I hope that you may return to your 4^ix>rs with
some renewed Inspiration from your contact
with the head of the department. (Applause.)
We meet to-night under circumstances in some
respects of the most Jelightful character and
yet with a shadow hanging- over us of which
we cannot be unconscious.
Sympathize "With President. .
We all profoundly sympathize with our
great chief; our hearts go out to him in sym
pathy; they are full of love and affection and
devotion to him' as he stands by the bedside
of his sick wife, and I ani sure .that we all
profoundly hope that the companion of his
life, who shares with him In so high a de
gree the affection' of the people of the United
States, may speedily be restored â¢ to her
strength. (Applause.) I ehould have felt al
most dlrpcsed to have asked you to excuse
me from this function to-night, possibly to
have suggested that it might be abandoned;
but for the fact that I know that the Presi
dent of the United States would himseir, had
he been consulted, have said to you and to
me to proceed with what you have planned,
for this is an occasion of such a character
that he would have recognized that it might
fitly proceed even under the circumstances of
the hour. -
I wish that I had fitting words to express
my appreciation of the great pleasure I feel in
meeting you as you gave me the opportunity
of doing to-night; but your kindness and the
kindness of the people throughout this coun
try wherever we have gone in our Journey of
the past two weeks has permitted no time for
any meditation of any speech that might be
made. ' â¢ '.. - Â¦' Â¦
I shall comÂ© to you therefore with no
studied phrases, but ask you to accept as my
response to your expression such thoughts as
may be suggested at the moment" and to. ac
cept such spontaneous words as spring to
my lips from these Immediate surroundings.
I am glad to meet these representatives of the
postal service. You will permit me to say that
I feel specially honored ,at the presence here
to-night of the distinguished â¢ chairman. . your
own representative in Congress, the distin
guished chairman of the committee of the
House of Representatives with which our de
partment has most to do. (Continued applause).
Perhaps I should rather reverse the phrase
and eay the chairman of the committee who
has most to do with us. (Laughter.) For my
honored friend will pardon me If I say that
we sometimes think ho "does" us." (Laughter
and applause.)
Praise for Loud.
But I am prepared to say here what I have
repeatedly said, not in his presence, that no
man in Congress charged with a great work
as he is charged Is mor*' thoroughly - master
of the , subject committed to his hands, and
more honestly and : intrepidly devoted to the
duty which Is assigned to him. -(Applause.)
I have come through three years of experience
to understand the spirit Â¦ which animates -the
chairman of that great committee, and I con
gratulate you and I .congratulate my coun
trymen that that important service, so vital
to the I welfare of our country, . so pervasive
In its- relations, so broad In its relations, is
in the hands of a man of the, highest integrity
and ' courage, -who fearlessly performs what
he believes to be right, : and who intelligently
guides It and Congress In the advancement
of the postal service of the United States. '
The importance of that service to which you
are devoted and which in this locality owes
so much to your faithful efforts can hardly be
overestimated. ! It is the branch of the Gov
ernment which comes most directly and inti
mately In communication with the peoDle. It
is that brantfh of the Government whose faith
ful discharge on the one hand or whose lax
and unsatisfactory performance on the other
so directly and so vitally concerns the inter
ests of the great body of the people. (Ap
plause.) And I want right here to testify my
appreciation of the fidelity and the intelligence
with which the representatives of the postal
service performed Â¦ the duty which Is com-'
mltted to their hands, whether it be the post
masters themselves, like your own In this great
metropolis, or the chiefs of the various bu
reaus, like many of those whom I see sitting
around this board to-night; whether It be the
clerks in the office who devote themselves for
hours to their work; whether It be the car
riers who are dally welcomed \-lsltors In the
home, the shop and the office, or whether â¢ It
be the Intrepid and faithful representatives of
that great service, the railway mail service.
(Applause.) All of them are worthy . represen
tatives of the postal Â¦ system and. all of them
are entitled to the gratitude of the body of
the neople whom they so faithfully and suc
cessfully serve. (Applause.)
. Service Is Growing. >.
-.X"' 8 service. is growing way beyond the eom
njoli understanding. Our army of postal em
ployes exceeds the combined army, and navy
of the United States which carried Its flag in
triumph to Santiago and raised it in honor and
luster over Manila. (Great' applause.) It
numbers to-day more than double the entire
army, and navy of the United States' put to
gether. It embraces more on its roll than
one-third of all the . employes of all the rail
roads of the whole United States, and It has
grown day by day with a rapidity which is
almost beyond comprehension. Twenty ; years
agro- our, expenditures and receipts were but
little over $20,000,000 a year. The postal ' ap
propriation bill for the coming 1 fiscal year re
ported by my distinguished friend; who 'sits :
by my, side last winter carried an appropria
tion of nearly $124,000,000 for the coming- year
(applause), and great as the expenditures are'
our, receipts are growing even faster than our
expenses, so that the deficit which a few years :
ago was $11,000,000, has been steadily' declining
No man can predict what It will, be next 'year
or the year after, but one thing, we know
that our. service means to keep abreast of the"
wants and requirements O f the people and
whether Â«hat shall ' take more or ; less iV not
so important as that the demands of; the nub-'
lie interests shall be fully met. (Applause) Â¦'
Â¦ Our business Is to give . the â¢ people Â¦ the t best"
service of which we are capable, and though
we are-conscious of its defects,. yet I think we
may fairly say that thanks to the "great body
'of the practical, active worklngmen the service
grows better and better, and I , undertake to
say, assuming no credit whatever to the chief'
of the department,- knowing' that he deserves
noipart of It, but giving . that credit Â¦ to the
practical workingman, that this organization ia
,the best business organization which exists to
day. In .the world [ (continued applause) \< and
that you can point to no private business any

A MOST enjoyable banquet was
given to Postmaster General
Charles Emory 'Smith last
evening by officials and em
ployes of the postal service of
this city and State. Seventy
five sat down to table soon
after 8 o'clock and 12:3'J saw them still
there.
There were several good speeches made
and some plain talk about postal methods
and the sen-ice generally and all of it
was received with the greatest applause.
TJie Postmaster General's speech
caused much enthusiasm and at Its close
he was given three cheers. He had to di
vide the honors with Eugene F. Loud,
whose name was received with applause
each time it "was mentioned.
The banquet hall was prettily decorated,
the carriers' mail bag being one of the
characteristic hits that served as recep
tacles for the choicest sweet peas and
marguerites.
The menu cards were works of art, the
distinctive cover design being a letter
box and just above it part of the cover
was removed to allow a picture of the
Postmaster General on the first page to
be seen as part of the design on the cover.
The menu itself was as line as the house
affords.
Mr. Smith's speech was not long, but he
took time to refer to almost every phase
of the postal service. He referred par
ticularly, however, to two subjectsâ the
extension of the postal service in the
rural districts, or rural free deli%ry^and
the Loud bill, designed, as he 'said, "to
prevent and correct the abuses'of second
class matter."
The Postmaster General was Introduced
by. W. W. Montague, postmaster of this
city, who in hie brief address assured the
guest of the evening that if the San Fran
cisco service is not the equal of or su
perior to any in the world It is not be
cause those who work in it have not tried
to make it so.
Is "Warmly Received.
The Postmaster General was received
with the clapping of hands, the rattle of
plates and shouts of greeting. He spoke
in response to "Our Honored Guest," say
ing:
I am deeply touched by this expression. I
profoundly appreciate the great compliment
which ycu pay to me lu the Invitation to this
Â¦banquet, and when thÂ« original Invitation was
confirmed this evening by the chaste and ele
gant renewal of that invitation in golden
characters I felt ihat I might carry away from
fian Francisco rot only the treasured memories
cf thlÂ» dellirhUul association but the valuable
and enduring evidence cf your personal regard.
I trust I may accept the tribute which you
par to me to-night not Elmply as an expres
sion to a chief, but as a recognition of the
fact that we are fellow- workers in the - same
service, that I share your pride In the service,
and that I appreclats thoroughly how much

said, to meet the working men of the ser

BUSINESSMEN from New York have been on
a visit to Texas for the purpose of seeing
how much of the State they wish to buy and
how far they can afford to do business with the peo
ple. When the visitors reached Dallas they were re
ceived with cordiality by a committee of prominent
citizens, of whom Barnett Gibbs, formerly Lieutenant
Governor of the State, was deputed to actas spokes
man. He was requested by his fellow citizens to
make a strictly business address, containing statistics
and other information that would give the New York
ers some conception of the prosperity of the. State.
He performed the task with distinguished succes'sl .
He began by saying: "We need New Yorkers in
our immense business, and cannot afford to" talk you
to death. It is hardly necessary to tell you of the
resources of Texas, for every New Yorker reads the
United States census .and the sporting news. A State
that Taises one-third of the cotton and' cottonseed of
the world, more livestock than any State in the Union',
that willsoon have a greater output of oil than all the
rest of the United States, and which has a-school t fund,
pretty women and everything else in the same pro
portion, doesn't have to feed you on statistics."
After saying he did not like to give figures to _New
York people on as big a thing as Texas he went on
to'say: "In this State men have been drowned by.
spouting oil wells. If we'keep on we. may strike a
lake of six-thousand-year-old brandy, distilled acci
dentally from the forbidden fruit. Should. that hap 7
pen we will let you in on the ground floor, though
that kind of thing will not need financing, the home
demand being strong and steady. * *. * When
the Texas silver mines quit paying we went over into
the next county and opened mines of / quicksilver.
While the "politicians were monkeying with oil trust
legislation the plain people bored and got more oil
than the trust had. The first seven cottonseed oil
mills in Texas were owned by the trusts/but the peo
ple built mills faster than the trusts could buy them,
and now we have about 150 such mills." "â¢ 'f . :^I-
Describing the energy of the people he. said: "You
will observe we have a kind of New York lope onus.
Well, in the early" days ''we were lucky in getting a
right smart sprinkling of Yankees, and we found out
that if we went slow we would get no rations, so we
struck their gait. They taught us to make butter for
the world without a cow, lard for the world without
bothering with hogs, a barrel of blackberry brandy
without one blackberry, ice without cold weather, arid
many other handy accomplishments.' Texas is on the
short'side only in money and factories^ Under the
new banking law we have organized more banks than
New York State has. In twelve; months more there
will be no room for more, railroads in^ Dallas^unless
they^are elevated."*'^*-*-, ;':;'.*... . -, . . . -'-0

delighted with it and was loud in praising its sim
plicity. Another learned advocate of the venture is
M: Ch. Meray, professor of mathematics in the fac
ulty, of sciences of Dijon, who recently wrote a letter
to the Paris Academy of Sciences warmly commend
ing the new language for "its logical and *wonderfully
ingenious construction, and its aptitude to recapture
with incomparable superiority the place which Latin
held during so many years for the learned of different
nationalities." \ . ' i".
A recent summary of the report of Professor Meray
says: -t'There are no grammatical difficulties in Es
"peranto.' In 'all it has but sixteen rules, unburdened
with exceptions, and seventeen grammatical termina
tions, so plain and simple._that" they, fix themselves;se
curely in 'the,' memory after; 7very.\ brief ' application.
There is no trouble with its orthography. Each sound
is. noted; each letter is pronounced." ?.' ; .'
. The rsubjeot has occasioned no little- interest 'Â¦ in
Europe, whcVe the need of a; common -language -. is
much more understood than; in the -United'* States.
The French jAcademy of! Sciences is occupying, itself
with the new language, and it is to be brought to the
attention~of the International Association of Acade
mies. Another report says.the members of the Vienna
Dental Society have pledged themselves to master it
and to extend its use.; It is evident, therefore, I that
Esperanto is not lacking in support, and before; long
we ; may hear . of a proposal to introduce' it into the
public Â¦ schools of all nations. ';- - : .:

GOLONEL BRYAN is kept busy striking at
members of his'party who show signs of quit
ting or who' declare for a reorganization.
Senator McLaurin. of South Carolina recently stood
forth as a come-outer and caused disgust to veneer
the columns of the Commoner.
Now Senator Vest raises the voice of fatigue, de
claring that a convention should be called to re
organize the party. This cuts deeper than desertion
to the Republicans, because it is an admission that
Bryan has so disorganized the party that it is bank
rupt and can only continue business by a reorganiza
tion.
This rouses the ireful Colonel, and he emits "views"
as swiftly as a cora-sheller does cobs.
In his latest, on Vest, he returns to his celebrated
cheap money, quantitative theory of currency and
prices. It does not seem to occur to him that there
was' ten-cent cotton and dollar wheat when the money
of the country per capita was only one-third its pres
ent volume. His theoiy is that if a man have a thou^
sand dollars he will pay voluntarily ten times as much
for .an article as he would if he had only a hundred
dollars. The country is concerned more with the cir
culation of money than with its quantity. But a very
small percentage of business is done by the actual
handling of money. Its circulation is . largely vi
carious, in the form of checks, drafts, exchange and
letters of credit These mobilize the money of the'
country when there is a condition of business confi-
derice. The infirmity of Bryan's mind is shown in his
constant prediction of panic and hard times. With
him the thought is fathered by the wish. He would
better take off his tilue goggles and heed President
McKinley's wise and worthy saying that "the country
needs patriots, not pessimists."
Mr. Bryan takes great hope from any fall in prices,
arfd declares that "thÂ« plentiful dollar is the cheap
collar." Â¦ -: â¢ -Â¦â¢',â¢â¢Â¦Â¦
The cheap dollar is one that is not worth its face,
not worth one hundred cents. The business standard
of value throughout the world is gold.' In that stan
dard commercial exchanges are exchanges of value for
value. If those exchanges are in silver dollars worth
onty fifty cents each, two of them are needed to buy
a dollar's worth. That is what Bryan calls a -rise in
prices, when it is merely a fall in the value of the dol
lar. Prices and values remain where they were.
Jackson knew the great law of a medium of ex
change when he said: "Gold is the universal and only
honest standard of value, and all forms of currency
should be measured by it."
:Bryan seems incapable of comprehending this, and
so he walks round and round in the same circle, like
a mule grinding a mudmill. .

A PHILADELPHIA STIMULANT.
1 Â¦ ......' ,"*>.Â¦.Â¦ - ' '. .'..Â¦Â¦.
FROA1 the Philadelphia Press we learn there has
been invented in that city a new form' of cock
tail composed of ingredients which, while' noni
intoxicating, form in combination a drink said to.be
as fascinating as "absinthe, and which is doubtless just
about as deadly.
( The discovery of the existence of the drink was^
due to the fact that a reporter 1 saw a waiter throw
a well-dressed man out of a restaurant Upon being
applied to for; an explanation f of his act the waiter,
said: "That man and a whole lot like him' have what
is known as the condiment habit.. It. is their practice
to come in and order a cup of coffee,' and after they
have drunk it they, gather all the sauces, the salt and
pepper and every other condiment and no one else
around the table\can get a chance at .them. With the,
material before them they, have a .real- good time.
First they take a dash of catsup. Into that goes
vinegar, the pfpper, salt" celery salt, Worcestershire
sauce, molasses and anything else that may be handy.
This they drink. 'â¢We have any number 'of such per- v
sons come in here. I firrt noticed it about six" months
ago. A lawyer who was in here the. other night told"
me that the people that carry on this way are called
the condiment cult. He said that .the desire to drink
the fierce mixture they' compound i is almost as bad*
as that which the morphine fiend experiences."'
Other Philadelphia restaurants report a similar ex
perience Svith the new. cult. In one of the principal
cafes of the city the head waiter-said the place had
several regular customers who insisted on mixing the 1
condiments on the table' and drinking, the mixture.
"When they are regular patrons," he said, "we simply
humor them and put the price on their bill, but when
outsiders come in we discourage them and we cannot
say that they have ever tried to get us arrested."
Further, investigation disclosed the fact that women
are included among the devotees of the cujt. Some
of them have carried it to such an extei|| that res
taurant keepers have had to forbid the waiters to
serve, them >-ithi condiments. . One authority says:
"Once the condiment habit gets hold of men or
women it seems. to cling to them; and I have noticed
that the members of the .cult, decline. . rapidly^in
health-.'"- ?;Â¦; ' Zy.'t -Â¦:-Â¦â¢Â¦ *' % '0k'~ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'>-Â¦ 1 >.H < /; '' '
.This is a strange form of mania to have its origin
among a people who live such well ordered lives as
those of . Philadelphia. It would have been less sur
prisin^fliad it originated in Chicago; and yet perhaps
there is ample- reason -for its '.Philadelphia origin.
There is a human craving for stimulants under all cir
cumstances, and the duller the community the greater
the. heed of stimulation. Drinking at all seasons may
satisfy other people, but. the Philadelphians wish, all
seasonings in their drinks, and as a consequence the
condiment cult has arisen and*restaurants suffer.
One of the glowing tales of the East is a story to the
effect that Pierporit Morgan is going to establish
an Atlantic ' steamship line de . luxe for the ' use of
millionaires. The price of passage is to be $1000 for
a first class staieroom. It is a good story in its way,
but its appearance may. be' taken as a proof that the
silly., season is : about to burst uport us with unusual
severity. Â¦ . . , - ' \. Â¦_Â¦ . ' ,

WITH a fullness of sympathy." that. c will ex
clude all sense of disappointment from their
hearts the people who had for weeks been
preparing a grand and jubilant reception for 'â¢ the
President will learn that owing to the illness of Mrs.
McKinjey the tour; .will not be carried out. The -0116
touch of nature that makes the whole, world kin is
felt in this emergency. . There will be few regrets
over preparations; made in vain for festal ceremonies
that are not .to be, but there will be a profound and.
universal "regret that the abandonment -ofthe tour has
been caused by the illness of a woman so beloved by
the people, and for whose coming so many bright ex
pectations have been cherished in every city and town
along the route that had. been 'planned for the jour
ney north and eastward from San Francisco.
The President has done the utmost he could to
avoid disappointing the people. â¢ He has borne the
strain of travel and public business, and the excite
ments of receptions and public parades and functions,
while watching with anxiety the increasing illness of
his wife, until the limit of endurance has been
reached, and now he can do no more. So long as
Mrs. McKinley's ill health continues there can be for
him no further festivals and social functions. Every
hour not required for public business will be given to
the ministrations which he owes to the woman Who
during the whole course of his manhood has been the
helpful companion in all his struggles and the author
of his finest joys.
The home life of these two people has been essen
tially American. It is'the kind of life. that makes the
virtue of our republic. The record of it has been a
story- as. beautiful as was ever told in any romance,
and the fierce light of publicity that has shone upon
it ever since the two entered the White House to hold
the foremost place in the republic has had no other
effect than that of bringing out more brightly the
charm Â«i its simple but sublime happiness and pathos.
In this country the mutual devotion of husband and
wife has not been made the subject of mocking wit
and satire as in other lands. All American ideals tend
to the contemplation of the home inhabited by love
as the consummation of human happiness^ *It is of
such homes our greatest poets have sung and our
noblqst novelists written, and, moreover, it is of such
homes our communities are built up. There- is in
this country, therefore, the fullest and most loving
sympathy with every phase of family life, and the
good husband and the good wife are honored by' all
whose honor is worth having.
Not long ago Mrs. McKihley is reported to have
said she would be glad when the Presidents term of
office expires, because he has now to give so much
of his time to public affairs she can. see but little of
him. "When his term is over," she is quotea as say
ing, "we will go home and settle down, and I can
have him all to myself." : . "
In her present ill health no one will dispute that
wifely desire for the husband who has tended her so
carefully and so lovingly through all thest years. To
her the people willingly yield him. As he sits by the
bedside of his sick wife he will receive the loyalty and
love of the country as abundantly as he could ever
have received it in scenes of the most popular of
demonstrations. There is to be no more noise and
tumult of applauding thousands mingled with . the
music of military bands, but in place of that there rises
from all the homes in the Broad land an earnest prayer
that this health-giving climate of ours may work its
wonders upon the invalid and so surely and speedily
build up her strength' that her health will be no longer
a matter of. anxiety to the noble man who is as ; hbn
ored for his devotion to family ties as to any other
of those abiding virtues upon which our social fabric
rests and out of which the true grandeur of "our re- 7
public has arisen. ... ; ,.

- ; Everybody "Wants Health.
After all, what we all want is health,
not merely negative healthâ keeping out
of: the hands of the doctor â but a health
which, as Blackie puts It, "is the growth
and vigorous condition of every member
of â¢ the \body." "Health," says an old
magazine article, to which the writer's
name is not- attached, "is perpetual youth.
Health-is' to feel the body a luxury, as
every -vigorous child .does, as the - bird
does when it.-<6hoots and quivers through
the air, not flying for the sake of the
goal, but as it flies when in broad swim
ming circles it cleaves the air merely for
the pleasure of the flightâ as the dog does
when he scours madly across- the meadow
or plunges into the muddy blissfulness of
the stream. But neither child nor bird
nor dog enjoys its cup of physical happi
ness â let the dull or worldly say what
they willâ with a felicity so cordial as the
educated .palate of conscious jnanhood or
womanhood. What a shame that even
Kingsley should fall into the cant of de
ploring maturity as a misfortune and de
clare that our freshest pleasures come be
fore the age of 14."
'To feel one's life in every limbâ this is
the secret of bliss, and "it is absurd to say
that ,we cannot possess this when char
acter." is mature, but only when it is half
developed. Â¦ Â¦ *
Opportunities for the American.
We need more examples of a mode of
living which shall not alone 'be a success
in view of some ulterior object, but which
shall- be, in . its nobleness and healthful
ness, "Â¦ successful every moment, as it
passes^on. .. Navigating a wholly new
temDfirarnen,t'through history, this Amer
ican race must of/ course form its own
methods and take nothing at second hand,
but the same triumphant combination of
bodily, and mental training which made
human life beautiful in Greece, strong in
Rome. . simple and joyous in Germany
truthful, brave and active in England,
must yet be molded to a higher quality
amid this varying climate. The regions
of "the world most garlanded with glory
and romanceâ Attica, Provence, Scotland
âwere originally more barren than New
England shores, and there is yet possible
for us such a harmonious mingling of re
finement and -vi?or that we may more

Strong' Men Are a Necessity.
We as a nation are going through a
period of colossal enterprisesâ enterprises
that* involve millions of dollars, that
threaten revolutions, social/* political' and
religious, . and that make necessary men
to conduct them. It is not enough for a
man to be able to think, but he must be
able to do, and the man of the future can
not be a' subject of nervous headaches; a
dyspeptic or a paralytic, but a man,
hearty and'well in all his parts; a man of
muscle and enduranceâ a man who can
think . and act also, and of this' kind oÂ£
men we have far too few examples.
No one wishes to be simply strong any
more. The old ideas of Dr. Winship that
health came through strength were fortu
nately short livea Â¦ and the strong men
who exhibit in dime -museums are hardly
the kind of men most of us would wisn
to be. .
. There is a great difference between be-,
ing strong and being robust, the latter
quality, liKe everything else desirable, be
ing the more difficult to. obtain, and Is
something for the absence or presence of

Xm.-SrTRENGTH AND PERILS OF ADTJI/T AGE.
Quetelet.says'we do not get our max
imum height until we are about 50 years
of ( age, then we begin ;â¢ to recede,' and at 90
years we have lost'about one and one-half
inches, owing to: the contracting of soft
parts and' the stooping posture assumed
by the ; body. While . this " is perhaps true
of the individual It is surprisingly not true
of the average man,- who does-* not seem
to lose much in height, probably because
as age. Increases the short and less ro
bust are eliminated by death, leaving only
"the stronger type of individual. 1 -
However these facts may be, Jt is true
that certainly by 50 years of age we have
arrived Â¦- at anatomical and- physiological
maturity and that most of us by. that time
have perhaps lost a . little in '- height, al
though possibly increasing in weight.: It
Is also' true that at:50;we are not nearly
as good "all-round" men as we were at 30.
When People Complete Their Growth.
r .Roberts says boys complete their growth
at about 23 years of age, while girls arrive
at full stature at about 20 years," :but
neither arrive at their full strength until
about 30. . Â¦
,, Whatever the final result of the physi
cal examiners may show along these lines,
\>ur subject leads us to deal with a ma
turity, a middle life and adult age, which,
inrcommon parlance,, all mean the same
thing. Our subject, is the man-or woman
who has passed through' the careless age
when he or she is. in the. full tide of in
crease in all directions, past thetime-of
freedom from cares up to the'period when
the Individual is confronted; with the ques
tion of. how to live and care for a family.
When anthropologists come, to write the
history*of this generation they will have
to mark it as an age of awakened atten
tion-to the needs of the body, , together,
with and because of a "tremendous over
strained-nervous -life, >' the first being
largely the result of the second.
'; Becovery From the War Period.
Thirty-five years, n go athletics and phy
sical fun were things about which
knew but little. At that time we were just
emerging from a civil war, tired,- worried,
uncertain, two immense armies on our
hands, our money .of doubtful value,'in
dustries paralyzed â mentally and physi
cally tired out. But owing to the perse
verance and courage of our ancestors, who
built their homes and raised their crops
in the presence of hostile Indians,, we
have to-day a nation or. greater pros
perity.than any other under the sun. ' .:
Athletics for "Souths; -What for
Adults?. Â¦ t
That athletics has in a way run : wild
seems a proposition to which most would
agree, and yet every good thing -ad
vances too far befoYe'it finally settles
back into a rational position: We need
athletics if for no other reason than _ to
use up the superabundant energy: with
which our youth are endowed. And while
football is too rough for the average- boy,
four miles too long a boat race for Im
mature hearts, and training is generally
carried over too long periods of time ana
la of too arduous a nature, still: the .total
result will be and is good. "But a graver
problem than that; of the regulation of
athletics is: What are v.'.e to do for the
adult man nnd v-o:nah-in the way-of en
couragement of physical exercise?" How
shall we keep the vigor "of .20 -years
whMi we are CO? It take3 no induce
ment to get the youth into some form.cf
recreative exercise, but he drops it as
soon as the cares of business besm to
occupy him, and yet. for the preservation
of liis own health and for the betterment
of posterity he should then be conserving
and training all the energy his football
days stored up for him.
The athletics of youth helps to make
fine physiques, and gives added health and
strength, but .in thus giving us .better
millinery it also increases our responsi
bilities, for disuse soon . ruins any ma

The production of the evidence concern
ing the real Texas rates may be in the
discretion of Attorney Frank H. Short.
He hAs been Interviewed by a Call cor
respohdent-and says in substance that he
will bring up the Texas matter. "It seems
to me," Mr. Short Is reported to . have
said, "that no good reason can exist why
California oil producers should pay a
higher rate for transportation of oil than
the Texas producers over the same sys
tem, it being admitted that no more fa
vorable condition could exist for oil
transfer than exists In California. The
conditions make fair rates imperative." '
Even at the present low rates in Texas
there Is dissatisfaction, which again
throws a strong side light upon the price
charged for moving the fuel oil in Cali
fornia. The correspondent of The Call at
Austin, Texas, telegraphs as follows:
AUSTIN Texas, May 15. â The discovery and
development of fuel oil of the Beaumont ' field
has forced upon the Texas Railroad Commission
the necessity of fixing: a tariff of freight rates
on that product between Beaumont and other
points In the State. The commission has re
ceived many communications during the last
few weeks from prospective consumers of this
oil asking: that a rate be established, and a
hearing on the subject will be called by the
commission in a few days to determine what
rate shall be fixed. It is asserted that under
existing freight charges the oil cannot be used
at an economical advantage over coal In some
sections of I the State. Many larse manufac
turers of Houston, Galveston and San Antonio
are already using- the Beaumont oil for fuel,
however, and It will quickly come Into general
use throughout the State when equitable freight
rates on the product are fixed.
Railroad Commissioner . Blackstock of
Ventura County makes the ! .statement
that Ithe people of Southern California, so
far as he has ascertained, oppose the
proposition to have a rate of 25 cents per
barrel made from Bakersfield to San
Francisco, which- is requested by Le
Blanc in his complaint.. He does not give
any reason for this opposition. None iiaa
been,' made public by the Southern Call-*
fornia newspapers. ' . Â¦ . .
Short's Opportunity.
hachapi. â¢ , V
Since the complaint was filed the secre
tary of the Railroad Commission of Texas
has forwarded to the Board of Railroad
Commissioners of California an annual
report which contains what purports 'to be
an official statement of the rates for the
transportation of fuel oil in Texas that
are now in use. The statements In the re
port are entirely misleading. The fact is
that fuel oil In Texas is moved from Beau
mont to El Paso, a distance of 91G miles,
for 19 cents per barrel of 600 pounds. Â«The
report received from, the Texas commis
sioners makes the rates for distance of 225
miles and upward, according to. whether
the oil is carried over roads entirely under
one management or over roads under dif
ferent managements, from 72 cents to 90
cents per barrel of 600 pounds, or 12 to 15
cents per 100 pounds, the tabulation being
made up in the latter form. Â¦
Misleading Evidence.
On the showing of the evidence con
tained In this report it can be made to ap
pear that the rate in California is less
than the rate in Texas, whereas the -real
fact is that the rate in California, con
sidering distances, is six times the charge
of Texas. From El Paso to Beaumont tlie
distance Is over WO miles as acalnst COO
miles! from Bakersfleld to San Francisco.
Moreover, the road in Texas is over sleep
grades for a good part, while the road
trom Bakerstield to San Francisco Is prac
tically all down hill.
Whether the real facts will be made to
appear in reference to the Texas rates
when the Railroad Commissioners may
finally come to the hearing Is an interest
ing question. It may have been impossible
for the Texas Railroad Commissioners to
convey to the California Commissioners
the truth, but there was no difficulty In
ascertaining it when. The Call sent a
query to El Paso. .The answer came soon
after the query wa3 sent on Its way. The
California Railroad Commissioners have
no official knowledge of the actual Texas
rates: Plainly the transportation lines
are interested in keeplnfc the California
people In the dark if possible. There is
a suspicion in some quarters that the
printed report of the Texas Commission
ers, s.o radically misleading at this time,
has been steered up against the Califor
nia Commissioners by some interested
party. , -
The fact that some of the leading oil
producers of the Kern River district- do
not know. Mr. Le Blanc as a producer in
that section may or may not have any
Interest.
Unless all signs are deceptive, the usual
process of shifting responsibility when
there Â«are any proceedings before the
Board of Railroad Commissioners of Cal
ifornia Involving a proposed reduction of
rail freight rates in the State is about to
be again used. This time it is to belog
the minds of the oil producers of Califoix,
nla. Some time ago a complaint was filed
before. the Railroad Commissioners in the
name of John Le Blanc, who was repre
sented by Attorney Frank H. Short, in
which It was set forth that the rates for
moving the crude /fuel oil of California
were excessive. The rate between Bak
ersneld and San Francisco is. 42. cents per
barrel. The same rate holds good to points
north of Sah Francisco. In addition there
are spur track and ' switching charges

SlcKinley.
In the space immediately about the
fountain w"ere gathered the executors of
the Donahue estate and Mayor Ph,elan,
Scupltor Douglas Tilden, Louis de Rome,
representing the company that cast the
statue, and Irving M. Scott. A band pro
vided lively music to keep the crowd
amused. An hour wore away before there
was any positive information concerning
the ceremonies. Then Henry T. Scott ar
rived, accompanied by Chief of Police Sul
livan. Mr. Scott brought bad news. He
said that the condition of Mrs. McKinley 1 s
health was such that President McKinley
thought It best to remain with her.
I accept this beautiful work of art for the
city. I will call uÂ»on,Mr. Irving Scott, un
der whose management 'the Union Iron Works
has attained its high efficiency, to further ac
cept for the industrial and manufacturing in
terests of San Francisco this monumental
fountain which the city will now possess.
The filial ana generous act of James Mervyn
Donahue, the donor, shall be remembered and
appreciated by our people, and the work of
the sculptor, Douglas Tilden, a native of Cali
fornia, will indicate the position which we
have attained in artistic excellence, and the
casting, done under the supervision of Louis
de Rome, exhibits the capacity of our artisans
and craftsmen.
Jt should be interesting to the mechanics of
San Francisco to recall that Peter Donahue,
whose memory was the inspiration of this gift,
was a machinist by trade, who came. to San
Francisco a pioneer In 1S49, and established the
Mayor Accepts Fountain.
late James Mervyn Donahue for the gift they
have presented to the city. I regret very much
to anr.cunce that on account of the illness of
Mrs. McKinley the President will be unable to
accept any engagements for to-day. He re
quested me to state that inasmuch as this
fountain is given to the ci'y in honor of the
late Peter Donahue, the founder of the Union
Iron .Works, which haa given such splendid
ships to the nation, and because It is dedi
cated to the mechanics of San Francisco, he
was especially regretful that he was unable
to participate in its unveiling. I am sure that
his absence this morning is no less disappoint
ing to him than to the people assembled here.
On account of the sad circumstances which
compel the President's absence, we will' make
the ceremony as brief as possible.

early yesterday morning at the T i
statuesque fountain donated to the

hour set for the presentation exercises,
in which President McKinley was to hrfve
taken part, was 8:30. An hour earlier
than that there were throngs of citizens
hastening to the little square at the junc
tion of Battery, Market and Bush streets.-
When the hour for the exercises had ar
rived the dense mass of spectators, entire
ly surrounding the fountain and. kept In
check by ropes and a large force of police
under command of Captain Spillajie, bB- â¢
came restless. Cameras were placed in
readiness to take views of the historic
scene. On surrounding tall buildings were
congregated hundreds of spectators, many
of them also being equipped with cameras,

Following this came a six-furlong- run,
for which Dangerous Maid had ihe call.
She wae played down to even money prac
tically when it became known Jim Hale
was not fancied. Kauntleroy. on the lat
ter, scrambled things extensively, and the
Maid delivered the merchandise. Toward
th* end Fauntieroy, on Jim Hale, again
came to the gurfac*. beating out Flamcro
for the place by a head.
Another choice finished first thÂ« Kst
event, over onÂ« mile and a furlonjr. Klo
Shannon looked a natural favorite, and,
allowed to make hi* own pace, the El Itlo

Everybody had Estado as a good thing
for the four and a half furlong two-year
old event, and, backed from 5 to 2 to 9 to 5,
the colt showed no speed whatever. Snow
berry, an S to 1 chance played to 4, won
by nearly ten lengxhs, after leading from
the start. Prestene, with Ransch up, got
the place from Autumn Time.
Alaska received steady support at 11 to 5

did everything but ring in for the fire pa
trol, and the gelding ran unplaced. Mc-
Albert led into the stretch, where Ranscn,
on Mont Eagle, challenged and in a drive
earned the decision by a neck. .Melkarth.
a 30 to 1 shot, led Alaska out for third
place.
Owner Billy Randall made no mistake
when he said Midlove would run away
from the field in the futurity course
pprint. The ring laid 4 to 1 about the httie
mare, and ehe tip^toed out in front from
start to finish. Russell brought Montal
lade along from the far rear, downing
Melocole. the favorite, for place honors.
The latter horse is unsound and cannot be
relied upon.
The St Carlo handicap, at five furlongs,
was exclusively for two year olds sired by
St. Carlo, and In addition to the regular
purse W. O'B. Macdonough, owner of that
noted sire, donated a handsome silver cup,
valued at $300. to be presented to the v-ln
ner. St. Phillipina and Hainault, the Lan
igan pair, ruled favorites In iho betting.
In a delay at the post, caused by the re
fusal of St. Sever to break, St. Phillipina
wore herself out. At that she led for
quite a distance before giving way to
Carlo. The latter was in turn passed and
beaten very handily by Achilles, the third
choice, ridden by Bassinger. Hainuult
finished third.
IX the absence of "PI" Ruiz, little J.
Ransch took a trick at the wheel, pi
loting four winners at Oakland track
yesterday. His snappy work in the
saddle was easily the feature of the
â¢sport, and the Burns & Waterhouse stable
lightweight was frequently rewarded with
well-deserved rounds of applause. In turn
he finished first on Mont Eagle, 7 to 1;
Midlove, 4 to 1: Dangerous Maid, 8 to 3,
and Rio Shannon. 8 to 5. The last two
mentioned purse setters were the only
favorites to be encased with brackets.

The arrest last Tuesday night of J. W.
Wolf, an expressman," by Customs In
spectors J. WJ Stone, G. B. Richardson
and S. H. Sackett on a charge- of being a
member of an opium smuggling gang was
a clever piece of detective work on the
part of the inspectors, who were acting
under the orders of Customs Surveyor
Spear. "Wolf had been shadowed by the
inspectors and Deputy St. John for sev
eral nights an>l his wagon was followed
by Inspector Stone on a bicycle for sev
eral days. He was In the act of delivering
a trunk at Mrs. Tapley's dressmaking es
tablishment, 317 Stockton street, when
the officers took possession of him and the
trunk. It contained sixty-five pounds of
smuggled opium, on which the duty,
amounting to $390, had not been paid.
Customs Inspector F. P. Loftus of Se
attle arrived here yesterday and informed
Surveyor Spear of the operations of the
gang of smugglers in that city. The opium
was manufactured in "Victoria, where its
manufacture under a license is legal, and
was then shipped in the night time to a
point in the vicinity of Seattle on board a
naphtha launch built and owned by the
smugglers. From Seattle the drug was
shipped in trunks, sixty-five pounds in
each trunk, to a certain city in Montana,
where a confederate received it. It was
then checked as baggage and shipped by
rail to this city and sold in the Chinese
quarter and to certain drug stores which
have been doing an extensive business In
the sale of opium for smoking purposes.

... They further charge that a number of
members of the Legislature cannot speak
or read English and that they requested
that they be furnished with statute books
so that they could get them translated Into
their own tongue. They claim that these
members could not be furnished with
enough of these eagerly sought books and
that they accordingly could not learn the
laws that governed them.
Harry E. Cooper. Secretary of the Gov
ernment, took a seat in the House of Rep
resentatives and at the same, time held
his former office. This they claim was il
legal and say that he was only removed
from the House after most strenuous ob
jections.
j The Republican party, with Sam Parker
as its champion in this country, tells a
different side. It claims that the "Home
Rule" party is spilt with petty jealousies
and 'through this wastes much valuable
time when the House is in session.
The Home Rulers' charges against
Dole are pointed. Those making them do
not beat about the bush, but come out and
say that through him and his administra
tion the Hawaiian Government is inhar
monious. They claim that he is a member
of a clique of sugar planters who run the
government of the islands to suit them
selves. They also claim that the adminis
tration is corrupt and that Governor Dole
has appointed the eugar planters as the
I heads of the different departments.
Pointed Charges Against Dole.
Wllcox and Beckley carry with them a
resolution adopted by the Legislature, for
mally urging the removal, of Governor
Dole. It was intended by " the Home
Rulers to have the resolution to send
Beckley concurrent, but the Senate ad
journed for the day, too early,. and as the
steamer was leaving that afternoon It was
passed as a House resolution. Beckley
has also several documents which he, will
present to President McKinley or to Sec
retary Cortelyou and which he declares
. put Dole in a very bad light.
Sam Parker is also an arrival from.
Honolulu and is at the Palace. He comes
to see the President for the other side of

Mail Steamship Arrives From the
THE exodus of gold hunters for the
Nome and Golofnln fields will be
gin next Tuesday with the depart
ure of the steamship Ruth. The
following Friday the Valencia will
get away and on Saturday, May 25, the
John S. Kimball, Portland and Cone
maugh will follow. On Monday, the 26th
inst., the City of Puebla will take a num
ber of miners who will join the Senator
at Seattle, and after her there will be
regular steamers until the season is over.
The Ruth made several trips between
Seattle and Skagway, but latterly has
been on the Eureka run. She is a new
steamship and well equipped for the voy
age north. Among the passengers who
will sail on her are W. H. Black, N. S.
Vestal, H. P. Kquires, H. Harris, R. L..
David, W.- Smith, W. H. Mann. D. B.
Libby and son, George Bunker, W. Bun
ker and M. Estey. All the first cabin and
nearly all the second is taken.
The ex-transport Valencia will go out
with every berth taken. Among those
who will go north on her will be Monroe
Salisbury and wife. Mrs. J. M. Lane, Mrs.
G. Taylor. Mrs. W. A. Clayton. S. Shaln
Â¦ and wife. Helen Wakefleld, Mrs. J. A.
Rockefallon, Miss Beecher. J. M. Collins,

Harlan, C. A. Kelly, H. G. Jones, J. J.
Clement, E. Johnson. F. M. Tracy. F. C.
Fellons, A- P. Mourdant and Mrs. D.
Eaton.
The Portland, Conemaugh and John S.
Kimball will also take all the passengers
they can* carry. None of the vessels will
have full lists leaving here, as they have
to call at Seattle for passengers who re
served rooms by telegraph.
The Carriage and "Wagon Makers' Asso-.
elation held a meeting at Xatlve Sons'
Hall .and agreed to appoint a committee
to adjust the scale of wages a
nine-hour day. This means a reduction to
some of the higher paid employes who
went out on strike. The strict letter of the
union schedule will be followed, but under
no circumstances will the union be recog
nized. Many shops are now running to
their former capacity.
Machinists are preparing 1 for thÂ© strug
gle \rlth their employers that will be in
augurated on Monday. An overflow meet
ing: of the men connected with the Iron
Trades' Council, as the eight "Unions com
posing- that body are called, was held last
night at B'nal B'rith Hall. An earnest
discussion of the demands that will be
made on that day resulted In the adoption
of a comprehensive plan of action.
On Saturday night, as at present ar
ranged, it is the intention that *ach fore
man shall inform the men whether the
heretofore submitted agreement has been
signed by the employers. If no definite
answer comes from the latter the men will
report for duty as usual on Monday
morning, but will refuse to go to work
unless the demand for nine hours a day
and an increase of 12H per cent In pay Is
granted.
A rumor has gone abroad that the re
quest, extended by the Union Iron Works
to other shipbuilding and iron working es
tablishments that the men be granted a
holiday on Saturday to witness the
launching of the Ohio was a covert at
tempt to prevent the machinists' strike.
That this intention existed is denied by all
concerned.
The; strike of the cooks and waiters is
6till manifested by the pickets in front of
restaurants. In a lengthy statement is
sued by the Retail Trades Council, repre
senting seventeen affiliated unions, the ef
fort of the waiters and cooks to better
their condition is approved. Following is
a part of the statement:
The Retail Trades Council does not approve of
rrmpathetic strikes, except as a. last resource
against oppression. It does, however, approve
of the action of the Bakers' Union in calling out
its members who were working- in bakeries at
tached t to restaurants that employ non-union
cooks acid waiters. The Bakers' Union hesitated
before ; taking- this Important step; but It was
forced "to take sides by the unfair actions of the
Restaurant Keepers' Association.
This association was formed for the purpose
of preventing- the cooks and waiters of this city
from ljtttering- their position.
The San Francisco Labor Council has
also issued a lengthy statement. *n which
appears the following:
It 1* positively known that the Employers'
Association, -with Its secret officers and 6ecret
Tnembfrsb.il>. is forcing hotel and restaurant
keepers, manufacturers and repairers of
wagons, metal-polishing firms and others Into
line by refusing them supplies' needed In the
conduct of their business. The small merchant
and manufacturer Is being used against his
will to flKht the trades union.

: AUTHOR'S SECRET.
Food that Brought Back Buoyant
Health.
ICewspaper Â¦writers have a time of It to
get the right kind of food to nourish
them.' One of this profession who writes
for a Boston paper pays: "From the first
Grape-Nuts Food worked like a charm.
My stomach had been falling to digest
ordinary food and my nerves were com-
pletely unstrung. I. was about to give up
work while- preparing a series of articles
for the press, but by Â» a stroke of good
fortune they began to feed me on Grape-
Nuts. My strength gradually returned,
nerves became steadier day by day, and
I soon found I could do more office work
with greater ease than ever before.
TIjere came to me that feeling of buoy-
ant health and 6atlsfaction with my work
and! satisfaction with myself. In 6hort,
I fejt that life was worth living and that
I was 'girded up like a strong man for
a race.'
In my opinion,' Grape-Uuts is the one
perfect article of food Invaluable alike
for those that are sick and those that are
welK" "W. S. Gidley, author of "Happy-
Go- Lucky Papers/' "The Landlord's
Story." etc.
It Is a fact that Grape-Nuts Food xloes
supply the brain and nerve centers with
the .elements necessary to rebuild, nourish
and 'maintain. That brings health,
strength, happiness and the feeling of
buoyancy Mr. Gidley speaks of.

PHOENIX, Ariz., May 15.â A company is j
now being formed composed of Phoenix
and â¢ Prescott = men to locate and operate I
a vast garnet field which exists In north
ern Arizona. The company is to be incor
porated at once, and will locate several
miles of claims in the garnet district.
The garnet lands of Arizona have been
the cause of much searching and excite
ment at various times. On several occa
sions Individuals have secured small sup
plies of the gems, but never in large
quantities. The district where they are to
be found is remotely located, and is out
on the desert where one would, least be
likely to Â¦ suspect Â¦ rich minerals ' to ba
found. Richard Tea. now living in Pres
cott. was the discoverer of the fields. In
1879 s he had charge of a detachment of
soldiers who were^ acting as guards for
United States census takers. Many miles
northeast -of Klagataff and across the
Colorado River thfey found a wide strip
of desert, covered with; ant hills. On and
arc und these hills the garnets were found, I
as the ants brought them from below the,
surface.,. The party . took along only a i
small quantity of the gems. Tea tried,
several times afterward to locate the
fields but did not succeed until - recently.
Ho'will be put in charge of the operations
of the company. -
i The garnets from these fields that have
found their- way to expert jewelers are
pronounced of a high quality. They are
nearly all of a dark, transparent red col
or, although some black ones are found.
Th>> formation of the material which goes
with the gems Js of a fnranite nature com
bined with iron alumina rock."

. TACOMA, May 15.âAlexander'McDon
ald; the richest gold miner in Dawson,
has been solemnly, invested with the title
and insignia of a- Knight of.St^ Gregory
by. special authority of Pope Leo Xlil.
Dawson advices say ' that the ceremony
of presentation; in St. Mary's 1 Catholic
Church was the most solemn service ever
held" there. ' The ' insignia of ; the â¢ order
was pinned upon Mr. McDonald's breast
by Mrs. McDonald, who knelt, beside him
before the chancel i railing. Â¦
Â¦Â¦ The Catholics of Dawson feel they have
been especially honored, since this order
has been conferred upon only two other
Canadians, both now dead. These were
former Governor Chapleaux and former
Prime Minister Mercier%of Quebec. The
presentation of the order. Â¦ to McDonald
was made by Father Gendreau, who re
ceived a papal letter to the recipient con
ferring the'., title last, summer, when
Father Gendreau visited Rome. The
honor is the result of Mr. McDonald's
liberality to the church, as exemplified
by his founding of the Hospital
and his gift of $25,000 toward St. Mary's
Church. These gifts were made three
years ago. ;.' Â¦

SLAIN BY AN ASSASSIN
! SAN JOSE, May 15.â The fleeting love of
a doctor and a pretty Spanish girl wa3
recounted in Judge Hyland's department
\of the Superior Court this morning when
the habeas corpus proceedings instituted
yesterday by Dr. Frank Martin of Merced
to obtain possession of his two weeks old
child came up for hearing. This action
was directed against Mrs. Louisa Coron
ado, in whose possesssion the child has
been since its birth.
Two years ago the doctor practiced
medicine in this city and where here he
fell a victim to the wiles of Alicia Pin
Â«rd, a dozen years his junior. Their mar
ried life was as short as the courtship
and a few months later she left him while
he was in Watsonville and returned to see
her mother in Guadalupe, who was on her
deathbed. The mother died and at the
funeral the doctor and his young wife
quarreled. He did not want her to at
tend the funeral, because she would have
ridden in a hack with a former admirer.
Dr. Martin was arrested for disturbing
the peace and the couple separated.
Mrs. Martin made her home with Louisa
Coronado. an old Spanish woman, and it
Is said she was madly Infatuated with
I Pietro Coronado, the latter's son. 7,i
fact, the doctor to-day said that his
mother-in-law on her deathbed had been
the means of separating, them, as she had
made her daughter promise to desert him
for the young man.
Mrs. Martin died on May 6, at the time
the baby was born, and the child fell to
the care of Mrs. Coronado. A few days
ago Dr. Martin returned here and de
manded his child, but the old Spanish
woman refused to give it up. Habea3
corpus proceedings were instituted and
Mrs. Coronado and the^baby were In court
this morning. After hearing some evi
dence Judge Hyland ordered the child
given into the custody of the father, who
will take It to Merced with him.

General Hoffman's Sudden Death.
Edward M. Hoffman of Elmira, adjutant
general of the National Guard and chief
of the Governor's staff, died suddenly to
day in this city. He was in consultation
Â¦with Major General Rohe, commander of
the National Guard, concerning the dis
position of the troops called into service
to quell disturbances incident to the street
railway employes' strike, when he was
taken with a faintness. He was assisted
to his room, but died before a physician
could be called. General Hoffman was
about fifty years of age.
In a hollow rKjuare of infantry, protect
ed by lines of pickets that reached into
every bisecting street and an outer skir
mish line in circular form that encom
passed, all, the traction tower wagon was
moved out of the barn this afternoon and
two hours were spent -in repairing trolley
wires. The heavy force of Guardsmen
and the stringency of the protective meas
ures seemed to awe the crowds that
surged around the outer skirmish line and
there was no <lisorder. The soldiers were
Jeered at and derided, but no one offered
them violence.
Sixteen of the non-union men were in
jured during the ride and many of them
stunned, .weak and scared, had to be
helped from the wagons. Of the sixteen
injured men only one was sent to the hos
pital: He was wounded in the arm and
head and the surgeons say he was shot.
The strikers say that eighteen non-union
men deserted during the ride and that less
than fifty were safely landed in the barn.
Many ITon-Union Men Hurt.
Smaller crowds had gathered at various
points along the route to the barn and
thev threw stones when the non-union
men rushed past. There was another wild
scene at the barn, where thousands more
had assembled. The infantry repeatedly
charged into the crowd, substituting butt
for bayonet, and after much effort a pas
sage was opened for the scurrying caval
cade and it was safe inside the inclosure.
Two blocks up State street a clever
military ruse blocked the downtown mob.
Two companies of the Tenth Battalion
were concealed in Chapel street, and when
the cavalry escort dashed past they ran
across State street and faced the pur
suing- crowd with fixed bayonets. The new
line wavered and broke on one flank, but
in the main the movement was successful.
But the non-union men were not yet free.
Suddenly a side door of the station was
thrown open and up the alleyway toward
the waiting teams marched the non-union
men. Once they were all aboard the driv
ers brought their teams out into the
street, the cavalry closed in around them
and the race was on. The police threw
themselves across the street in solid pha
lanx, but the crowd, roaring its threats
against the new men, swept over the po
lice and took up the chase. Ahead were
thousands more, and with no fear for
either heels of horses or blades of steel
they closed in. around the cavalrymen.
Soon there came a volley of bricks and
three of the non-union men sprang from
the rear wagon and were lost in the
crowd. The flying column dashed into
State street forthe run up past the capi
tol. Here the crowd was as dense and
desperate as the other, and men plunged
In around the galloping horses. One rider,

down on the face of one of his antago

Confronted by Fixed Bayonets.
The ray* of the setting sun gave glint
to busy sabers, but the long blades,
wielded by forbearing hands, seldom de
scended in serious blows. Several of the
mob were knocked down by cornered cav
alrymen, but the record does not yet score
a single fatality. In the passage through
the streets few of the non-unionists as- j
caped the flying bricks and stones tlÂ«at ;
were hurled at them, but les=s than a uoz- |
en were badly hurt. The courage of j
nearly a dozen of the non-union men â¢
failed them in the opening spurt through
the crowds and they sprang from the
wagons that carried them, to mingle with
and be lost in the crowd.
The ride of the non-union men through

sidewalks held firm and could not be^i

the Union station shortly before 6 o clock
and their delivery at .the Quail-street
barn, a mile and a half away, was made
with a dash under cavalry escort, with
mob resistance in almost every block.

The request for a reduction of the in
demnities will still te discussed by the
Minlst-ers at Peking, who must first get
the instructions of their Governments. It
is anticipated here that other nations will
make stronger objections* to a reduction
than Germany, which appears to be will
ing to reduce the amount if it is seen that
China is unable to pay. all." â¢
The prolongation of the payments to
thirty years will probably be accepted.
Germany, appears favorably disposed
thereto. .
The Chinese proposition to raise the im
port *and export duties will probably be
accepted, since the only other possibility
of increasing China's revenues is the re
form of the likin duties, which the pow
ers particularly wish to avoid, because it
would renuire too much mixing in the
civil affairs of China. Further interna
tional control over the customs will be
unnecessary, beyond Sir Robert Hart's. '
" Officials here, discussing, the answer of
the Chinese Peace Commissioners say the
fact of prime significance therein is that
the commissioners agree to the indemni
ties as demanded, and the withdrawal of
the troops can now proceed forthwith, but
that not all the foreign forces will be
withdrawn at once.

One of the men in the rooms, it is al
leged, had smuggled a torch into the
mine, as torches give a better light than
the safety lamps prescribed by the com
pany. At 9:15 o'clock a miner fired a shot
and the smoke, which was very dense,
caught fire from the torch and spread to
either the gas or dust and the explosion
resulted. Fortunately the mine did not
catch fire to any extent. The explosion
vented itself through the air-shaft and
almost demolished the building on the
surface in which the fan was located.
The men on the headings did not know
there had been an explosion until notified.
The air was soon turned in and in a short
time the headings were cleared of foul
gases and the work of rescuing the un
fortunates commenced. It was 5 o'clock
before the work was concluded.
The George Creek ' Company, a Balti
more corporation, had invested fully $1,
000,000 in the mine, which is one of the
best equipped in the Fairmont coal region.
The mine' was only recently put into oper-.
ation and about 125 men were employed,
only forty of this number under ground.
Of these fifteen were in a portion of the
mine that has teen worked for some time
and the remainder were working on head
ings quite a distance away.
The injured are: Charles Carpenter,
fatally; Carl Hunter, fatally; Herschel
Everson, fatally; Joseph Blaney, fatally;
Italian, fatally; Jefferson Fast, badly
burned; Thomas Bainbridge, badly burned
and bruised; Italian, burned and bruised.

The steamer Bomoa, owned by G. Kunst
<u Apia, Samoa, is to be used as a regu
lar liner between Honolulu and Apia, and.
is now on her way here on her first trip,
bhe is a vessel of about 1030 tons. The
camoa is expected by her owner to g-et
the business that was formerly done by
the Oceanic steamers, which used to call
at Apia on their way to Sydney. Since
the Samoan islands were partitioned and
Apia became a German port the Oceanic
vessels have began to call at Pago Pago,
which is an American port. The steamer
Samoa will bring copra from Samoa here,
for transhipment to Apia, and will go back
v-kh general cargoes.

NEW YORK. May 15.â The stock market
showed symptoms of relief late to-day and re-,
covered vigorously from its early acute de
pression, rising strongly over last night's level
and establishing substantial # net gains in the
majority of stocks. At one time during the
day prices had declined in a fairly sensational
n-.anner. the losses from last night's level ex
tending from three to ten points in a large
number of important stocks. Northwestern had
lost 9'j: General Electric. 9%: Cleveland. Cin
cinnati. Chicago and St. Louis. 7%; Lake Erie
and "Western. 7: Union Pacinc and Missouri
Pacific 6%; Consolidated Gas. 5; Delaware and
Hudson, b 1 ,: New York. Chicago and St. Louis
second preferred and American Tobacco, 5;
Amalgamated Copper, 5%: Denver and Rio
Gner.de. 4'4: Louisville. Manhattan and Peo
ple's Gas. 3\i. and many other of the Etandard
lailroad stocks as much as three points. The
level of net gains at the highest is the more
remarkable considering the acute weakness
earlier in the day. They reached In Rock
Island 7 points; St. Paul. 5%; Atchlson. 4Vi;
Burlington. 4% : Baltimore and Ohio. 3%. while '
the ntt gains as a rule were all the way from
a fraction up to 3 points. These gains were
only elightly yielded at the last which was firm
and active at about the top. This strong recov
ery seems puzzling in the face of the extreme
sensitiveness of the early market. The prog
ress of the liquidation which caused the early
weakness was in itself an immense relief to the
situation. It gave growing assurance of the
polvency of Stock Exchange houses who were
?-merging from any dangers that may have
beset them by the rapid conversion- of their
resources Into cash assets. It was the fear
that this could not be safely done which over
hung the market yesterday. The more of it
that wae accomplished the less remained to do.
The fact began to grow clearer also that spec
ulative accounts in the stock market in safety
were all that had been affected by last week's
slump. There remained some holders with bor
rowed funds whose loans were not sufficient to
protect their holdings by additional security
or to take them up outright. The selling out
of this class was stilt in evidence this morning
ana no effective support was in the market to
help them. The opening gains in sympathy with
the higher prices in London were quickly wiped
out by this sudden liquidation. The selling
came at spasmodic intervals and for the greater
part of the day no effective buying was evident.
On the successive down grades there were some
buying orders met, but they did not follow the
market upward until the last rally set in. When
it became evident that the urgent liquidation
had epent its force and that there was a large
reserve force behind the rally, the buying
orders grew in volume and In fact were largest
at about the top level. The announcement of
pold exports to the extent of $2,200,000 and the
weekly crop bulletin of the Government
Â¦Weather Bureau reporting the drought of the
orrps retarded by the unseasonable weather
fceiped the early depression. â¢ So did the rather
alarmist reports as to the outcome/ of payday
to-day in the London Stock Exchange settle
ment. There was a call to-day for the pay
ment of 10 per cent of the J50.O00.000 underwrit
ing subscriptlcn for the Burlington purchase,
and next Monday there falls due a 25 per cent
installment on the Union Pacific bond subscrip
tion, which will necessitate provision for about
Sin.coo.ooo. But these developments were prin
cipally sentimental, as the money market shows
growing ease with the progress of ' the stock
market liquidation.
The prospectus of the Russian loan issued In
Paris to-day and providing for subscription by
installment* slves some assurance arainst a
money market pressure on that account. There
was a perceptible growth of confidence also
that the hostilities precipitated in the struggle
ic.r control of Northern Pacific would be In
toiii* manner adjusted. With the relaxation of
the liquidation lt was comparatively easy for
friends of stocks to bid up their prices again
without encountering Important selling, and'the
late recovery was largely due In Its early stage
to pure manipulation of this kind.
The bond market did not fully recover from
ftp early weakness. Business was moderately
actiie. Total sales. $4,900,000.
United States Ss advanced % per cent on the
last call. â¢ ;

The leading, and in fact, only factor In the
Chicago market at the moment Is the weather
In the Southwest, where It has lately been
so dry as to menace the crop. During the past
day or -two, hdwever,' there "have -been -light,
scattering rains there/ and Kansas â¢ City yes
terday reported a good \ fall of two Inches.
There were, fair showers in Oklahoma, .but
the weather map does not Indicate general
relief, and as the- wheat Is already heading
out not half a crop is expected. The rain
caused "the crowd ; to " sell, however, and the
market opened weak and â¢ nervous, j Later on
the scalpers bought back their early sales and
the shorts covered, and this gave the market
a stronger tone. The strength In coarse grains
also Increased . the firmness, and the market
advanced. Sixty loads for export were report

LOCAL MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 15.â Weather conditions con
stituted the dominant factor In the wheat
market, aided by steady cables. Under a rush
of yesterday's short sellers to cover their lines
on the failure of promised heavy rains in . the
southwest, July wheat opened a shade to %@
Me higher at 71%@71Uc.- Offerings were un
equal to the demand and helped by advices
of free buying for export, the market steadil^
rose to 71%c.' At this point there was a modr
erate movement in profit-taking and a reaction
to 71V4@71%c followed. There was a quick re
coveryr'however, and. the close was strong",
%c higher at 71%@71%c. I v ' â¢
Strength and activity characterized the corh
market. July opened %@%c higher at 44%@
44%c, and immediately the price broke to 44S&
@44%c. Almost as quickly it reacted, selling
to 45%c, after which, on profit-takng. It ' re
acted to 45@45%c. May corn was theatrical in
behavior under persistent prompting by Phillips,
the bull leader, and broke all records for the last
nine years. The opening price was unchanged
at 54c. Phillips bid and grot but little, al
though he did not stop until 60c had been
reached. At this price Phillips is said to have
accepted private settlements from three houses
for an aggregate of 950,000 bushels. After the
high point had been reached a quick reaction
to 56c was recorded. This was followed by .a
slfarp rally to 59c and the close was. 4c higher
at 58c. Despite the higher bids made by PhH
llps,'- only 120,000 bushels were sold to him arid
this quantity, it was claimed,' would be actua'l
ly delivered. It furnished .evidence of the bull
leader's hold on the markpt, however, and this,
combined with the fallin_ off in receipts of
contract corn, alarmed, shorts ..and .accounts
for the alleged private settlements i made with
him at the top price. . /
Phillips bulled May oats from the start to
day, bidding them up to 31c, high price of the
crop. Crops over the greater part â¢ of the
South and the lower Missouri Valley are said
to have suffered from drouth. May closed 2%c
higher at 30%c;,July closed %@%c higher at
28%<Â§2S%c.' â¢
Provisions were dull and fairly steady In
sympathy with corn. July pork closed 7%c
lower and lard and ribs unchanged.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. May 15. â The American Wool â¢ and
Cotton Reporter will, say of the, wool trade
to-morrow: .Â¦ ' ', ; . â¢.
While the. market has shown no pronounced
activity, there are not wanting evidences of a
manifestation of greater Interest in the situa
tion, on the part of , the consumers, and on
Tuesday of this week a- few of the large mills
were represented- in the market and they are
believed to have taken on some wool. â¢ .The
actual amount of business consummated dur
ing the week under review, , however,- is not
large, the sales not exceeding 3,600.000 pounds.
The purchasing- is still mostly of a. hand-to
mouth character, very few consumers show
ing any disposition â¢ to largely anticipate their
wants. .'While the market has remained quiet
prices are as a whole well maintained. > The
sales for the week in Boston amounted to
3.445.000 pounds domestic and 453,000 pounds
foreign, making a Â» total of 3,600,000 pounds
against a total of 2,520,000 pounds for the
vious week,- and a total of. 2.631,000 pounds

CLOSING
NEW YORK, May IS.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Though business was again on an infinitesimal
scale on the stock market here to-day the tone
was brighter and much more hopeful. The
settlement which Is concluded to-day discloses
nothing of .a serious nature. Many lame ducks
have been helped and six. small firms will
probably succumb yet, but no such difficulties
as have been anticipated by willing, pessimists
have developed. American shares hesitated to
open and then developed Â¦ much confusion on
account of the departure of brokers from the
usual rule and their delivery of etocks direct
to dealers. Prices began wide, with differences
of 5 points in the hitsh-priced shares and 2
points In the cheaper issues, but generally well,
above parity. Chica?o, Milwaukee and St.
Paul common was the leader, with an advance
of 6 points. Business, however, was a matter
of Megotiation. When New York opened ' with
acceptance of IÂ«ondon's ; lead arbitrageurs ap
peared for the first time since the crash and
began selling specialtlt-s heavily on a rumor
that there was a hitch in the negotiations for
a compromise of the. Northern Pacific troubles.
The close was heavy and nervous, with prac
tically no dealing.

You takf more pride in your university

You need here, as we need in our older
Hartern State?, educated men and women
to con<3uot your affairs. We of Ohio are
rrcud of its resources, its manufactories,
it? commerce, but like you we take more
pride in Us men and women than in all

proud, it fillp me with great pleasure to

t A decision was handed down yesterday
by the Supreme Court, sitting at Sacra
mento, affirming the judgment rendered
by Judge Seawell of the Superior Court
of this city and county in which It was
held that the State Board of Railroad
Commissioners had no jurisdiction over
the Market Street Railway. Company and
could not examine Into the affairs of the
corporation for the purpose of fixing the
passenger rate or for any other purpose.
This decision effectually disposes of \ the
contention of the Railroad Commission
Â£hat the authority to fix the rates of all
streetcar as well as transportation com
panies was vested in it by constitutional
provision.
Review of Cause of Action.
Several years ago the Railroad Com
mission sought to Investigate the affairs
of tho Market Streot Company,
but Joseph L. Willcutt, secretary of that
corporation, refused to obey the summons
calling upon him to produce the books of
the company for invcotigation by the com
mission, which purposed assuming juris
Â¦dlclion over the company's affairs, es
pecially in the matter of rates. Willcutt's
refusal to produce the books resulted in
the filing of an application by the com
mission for a writ of mandate to compel
Willcutt to obey the summons of the com
mission. . . Â¦ ' â¢ .'. â¢
In the petition for the writ it was set
forth that on April 14, 1S96, the commis
sion determined to investigate the affairs
cf the Market Street Railway Company
with the object in view of "establishing
proper charges" for the carrying of pas
sengers. It was necessary that the books
of the company be examined and in conse
quence on August 1I> of the same year
Secretary Willcutt was subpenaed to ap
pear before the commission and furnish
it with the information desired.
Judge Seawell Sustained.
On September 7, the date set for "the
hearing, Mr. Willcutt, accompanied .by
Attorney Foshay Walker, appeared before
the board and refused to comply with the
demand of the commission. Suit to com
pel compliance wa3 brought, the commis
sion claiming the light to examine tho
company's books and accounts. The
company filed answer denying that tho
Market Street Railway Company was a
transportation company and denied the
commission's claim to the right to fix the
rates. V
The action was heard- by Judge Seawell,
argument on; the status of the defendant
corporation occupying several days. At
the end of the hearing Judge Seawell held
that the contentions of the company were
correct. Hence i he refused to issue i tho
writ and dismissed the action. Judge Sea
well's decision has been sustained by the
Supreme Court and the Market Street
Railway Company has won a substantial
victory.,. --'. :. ' . ' Â¦ "Â¦â¢'."

President McKinley met the members of
his Cabinet last evening at an informal
conference, which took place in the resi
dence of Daniel W. Earl, 2121 Laguna
street, adjoining the temporary home of
the Chief Executive.
The various members of the Cabinet and
the ladies of their families attended a
reception held by Mr. and Mrs. Henry T.
Scott, who are residing at the Earl house
during the occupancy of their home by
President and Mrs. McKinley.
The affair was not a reception in the
general sense of the word and lasted but
a short time. While the ladies of the
Presidential party met In one apartment
the President and his Cabinet met in an
other room.
When the Cabinet .Ministers had as
sembled word was conveyed to the Presi
dent in the adjoining house and he walked
with Henry T. Scott from onoresidence to
another. The Chief Executive had a
troubled appearance but, in his sorrow,
caused by his wife's illness, he had a.
smile and a greeting- for the police and de
tective guard and newspaper representa
tives assembled in the front of the Scott
residence.
At the conference held by the President
and his Cabinet It was decided that the
Cabinet should not attend any functions
to-day and word was sent to the local re
ception committee that the trip to Tam
alpals was to be canceled.
Regarding the other events, scheduled
for this afternoon and evening, the recep
tion committee was informed that the
Cabinet officers could say nothing definite
until noon to-day. The movements of
the Cabinet depend on the condition of
Mrs. McKinley and it is possible that the
members of the President's official family
may decide to take no part in any of the
programmed events of the week.
After the conference the President
walked from the Earl home to the Scott
residence and in the short walk he com
mented on the dense fog that was drifting
over the locality, shrouding the guards
surrounding the Scott home.
Greatest Apprehension Is Felt.
The condition of Mrs. McKinley re
mained the same last evening as during
the day. She was reported to have taken,
some liquid nourishment, but the great
est apprehension was felt lest, in her
weakened condition, the spark of -, life
might go out.
When Mrs. McKinley is conscious she
recognizes the President and he is con
stantly by her side.
"Doctors Gibbons, Â¦ Hirschfelder and
Rixey held another consultation last
evening, previous to the President meet
ing the Cabinet. The report of the doc
tors was not given out, but Private Secre
tary Cortelyou announced that there was
no change in- the condition of the distin
guished patient.
Since Sunday night the President has
been constantly by the bedside of his wife
and it was only in the hope of her recov
ery that the news of Mrs. McKinley's se
rious condition was held back from the
public The strain whicn the President
has undergone in the past few days has
been very trying and he has sacrificed a
great deal in order to try and carry out
his engagements.
President Stays in Sickroom.
During the entire day yesterday the
President never left the. room where his
wife lay, and it was only at the entrea
ties of those about him that he took a
few minutes' walking exercise.
The Cabinet Ministers reluctantly con
sented to carry out the President's wishes
that they attend the commencement exer
cises at Berkeley and visit Oakland, but
they had no heart in the festivities while
their great leader was watching at the
bedside of his sick wife.
The Cabinet officers did not attend the
jinks at the Bohemian Club last evening,
but pent their regrets. The deep gloom
that has fallen on the President is shared
by his official family, and it is likely that
fhey. will not take part in any functions
during the illness of Mrs. McKinley.
Unless there is an Improvement in the
condition of the President's wife this
morning a number of leading physicians
of the city will be called into consultation.
The President has every faith in the
physicians now in attendance on his wife,
but he desires that nothing that science
can do be left undone.
Knights Templar Abandon Parade.
The Knights Templar will abandon their
proposed parade scheduled for to-morrow
afternoon. A meeting of the order was
hejd yesterday, when it was known that
Mrs. McKinley was In a critical condi
tion; and it was decided that the wishes
of the President should be learned before
taking any further steps to hold the pa
rade. The Templars will learn to-day that
he will not participate in any events in
this city and in deference to his desires
the Templars will not carry out the pro
posed celebration.
This morning Dre. Gibbons, Hirschfel
der and Rixey will hold a consultation
and the result of the meeting Is awaited
with anxiety by the millions of people
who sympathize with President McKinley
in his hour of sorrow.

liminary examination of Thomas G. Jacques

lowed the cutting off of the current with
the result that Feeney's lifeless body was
found lying- in a heap on the roof. Just
above the body stretched the wires
charged with from sixteen to twenty
thousand volts of electricity, which had
been the agents of death. These are the
main transmission wires of the Bay Coun
ties Power Company and they carry the
electricity 140 miles from the Yuba' River.
They enter the power-house through the
roof at the point where Feeney was work
ing.
That Feeney should have come In con
tact with the wires is accounted strange
by his employers. He was more than or
dinarily cautious about his work, they
say, and never moved about without first
ascertaining if it was safe to do so. The
most plausible explanation is that the dead
man slipped down the corrugated iron
roof upon the wires below him, the lum-
OAKLAND, May 15.â Sixteen thou
sand volts of electricity Instantly
killed Thomas J. Feeney this
morning at the Piedmont Power
house of the Oakland Transit
Company. There were no witnesses to the
accident and just how it happened is not
known.
Feeney lived with his wife and three
children at 1570 Filbert, street and was
employed as a carpenter by Contractor
Harry Wharton, who is doing some work
for the Bay Counties Power Company,
which furnishes electricity to the Oak
land Transit Company. He has been
working steadily for three weeks past
with the power company and to-day he
was to have finished up his. employment
and quit the place. Â¦ .
Feeney started to work at the power
house at 8 o'clock this morning and a few
minutes afterward he was ordered by tho
superintendent of construction to go to
the roof of the building for some timbers
that had been left there. They were to
have been used as supports for a water
tank being built in another section of the

warning that something had happened
came through the "growling* of tho

Gopher Tails in Utah
Too Numerous for
a County.
SALT LAKE, May 15.â Gophers, at 5
cents a head, have brought practical
bankruptcy to % the county of Tooole,
Utah. They multiplied so rapidly as to
become a veritable plague, and enterpris
ing men, and school boys as well, have
profited so much by killing them and re
caiving bounty for their tails that the
County Commissioners not only have abol
ished the practice of paying bounties, but
also have been compelled to cancel bids
for the erection of a new county jail be
cause nearly all the treasury funds have
been paid out for .gopher tails.
A few weeks ago the rodents became so
bad that the County Commissioners of
fered a bounty of 5 cents, apiece for them.
In a -few days the schoolhouses of the
county were practically without pupils,
nearly every boy, armed with traps and
poison, being out in the fields and prairie
hunting gophers. Men joiped in the hunt.
The little animals were slaughtered by
thousands, and one day the county paid
out $800 in bounties. So great became tne
drain that notice has now been published
abolishing the bounty and bringing an end
to a very flourishing Industry. The notice
came too late to save the treasury, but in
the meantime the county has been rid of
a pest that was bringing ruin to every
farmer. I

The members of the Tlvoli Opera Com
pany held their annual outing near El
Campo . yesterday, with Mrs. ; " Ernestine
Kreling as hostess, and the affair was a
big success. The party to. the number of
forty left this city In the morning and
crossed the bay to Tiburon. Here
launches were pressed Into service and a
pleasant spot on the Marin hills was se
lected for the day's enjoyment.
"Teddy" Hartman was president of the
day and under his direction, and with
"Doc" Leahy as timekeeper, a programme
of athletic events was carried out. The
first event was a swimming match be
tween Hartman and "Cupid" Newbauer,
which resulted in a dead heat. Paul Stein

pany, won the; fat man's race In a close
finish with Michael Voisin. keeper of the
back door, who is said to be handicapped
with a broken leg. . -. â¢ ~ â¢ â¢
Harry Cashman won the prize for
throwing the hammer he being: a "promi

mer nearly killed a calf in the adjoining
field and the irate owner had . to be paci
fied with some of the edibles and drink
ables which the party brought along for
its own delectation. Maud French caught
the first fish of the day and won a pair
of shoes. The fish weighed two ounces
and will bo preserved as a -memento of
the occasion. The hopping race was won
by a Japanese who doe3 . not use any
"hop." Arthur Cunningham, the hand
some barytone of the company, won the
female race, and Annie Myers got so sea
sicjc that she gave up her part in the next
piece. "Ted" Webb was accused of fixing
the races and winning all the money in
sight, and "Freddy" Kavanagh "snap
shotted" the whole crowd. â¢
An amusing feature of the day was the
rescue of Harry Cashman from one of the
recks In Raccoon Straits. He missed the
boat and hired a launch, in which he pro
ceeded to Tiburon. â¢ He ran high and dry
on the rock and an improvised life-saving

When Engineer Babcock and a force of
men climbed to . the roof they found a
charred and almost unrecognizable body.

morgue. '."Â¦â¢
"It is very evident that Feeney lost his
footing," said Engineer Babcock, com

he touched the wires he was killed. He

At the commurication of the Grand
Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows yesterday the recommendation of
Grand Master W. W. Watson that thera
be built as an adjunct to the home at
Thermalito a hospital for the proper
treatment of the Invalids tjiere was adopt
ed and the trustees were authorized to
expend for such purpose a sum rot to ex
ceed $3000. Grand Master Watson's other
suggestions that there be a smoklnic
room apart from the library and improve
ments in the barber and the shoemaker
shop, which will involve but small ex
pense were also adopted. The action of
the Grand Lodge In appropriating the sum
named for a hospital is taken as a slsn,
that a possible removal from Thermalito
will not take place for some years.
The report of the special committee en
site for a new. home was adopted. ThÂ»
only recommendation In that report was
that the Alum Rock site, known as the
White tract, should be accented contin
gent upon Santa Clara, fulfilling certain
conditions. On this point the report says:
Your committee has learned, to its great re
gret, that there is grave doubt as to the abil
ity of the Odd Fellows and citizens of Santa
Clara County to raise the money required to
purchase the White ranch. The price asked
Is $20,000. and, while not considered unreason
able, is such that we would not, under all
the circumstances, advise the Grand Lodge to
purchase the property. In case (he Santa
Clara County Odd Fellows and citizens renew
their generous offer, and pledge themselves to
raise the needed money and donate the White
ranch to the order, subject to reasonable con
ditions as to time of building, your committee
would unanimously recommend lta acceptance
by this Grand Lodge." -
The report of the committee of the trus
tees of the home was adopted exceot that
portion relative to expenditures.
An announcement was made that lhÂ»
daughter of an Odd Fellow, a resident of
Los Angeles, 'was in distress. The hat
was passed around and the sum of $110
was secured.
' A great- part of the afternoon session
was taken up in the discussion of appeal
cases. .
In the evening the Initiatory work was
exemplified by Fidelity Lodge, and then
followed the third degree given by Apollo
Lodge.

LOS ANGELES, May 15.â "We will both
die together!" shouted Henry W. Wittmer
about 8 o'clock to-night, as he pointed a
revolver at his wife; but Mrs. Wittmer
was too quick for him, and springing ln
eide the door, she slammed it shut and
bolted it.
Wittmer, muttering some incoherent ex
clamation, 'then placed the revolver's
muzzle In his mouth ahd pulled the trig
ger. The bullet pierced his brain and he
fell dead. He was found lying in a pool
of blood when excited neighbors rushed
to the scene upon hearing the shots.
It was some time before the distracted
wife emerged from the house where the
shooting occurred, which is located at 330
Edgeware road, just south of Temple
street, in a rather isolated locality. She
was taken to the home of her father, J.
H. Disler, who resides at 1247 Iona street,
close to the scene of the tragedy.
When seen at her father's home Mrs.
Wittmer, who, despite her claim to the
age of nineteen, is little more than a child
In appearance and action, told a sad story
of a hurried and romantic marriage and
Its tragic ending.
"I met Hermann last September in
Fresno," said the. "and we were married
after an acquaintance of but two \veek3.
The ceremony took place on October 1,
1900, and I lived with my husband only
three days, returning to my parents' home
on October 7."
The following note, addressed to his
brother, Adolph Wittmer, at the Garfield
Hotel, Tacoma, Wash., was left by the
suicide:
Dear Brother: As I am about to commit an
act of which none of our family is guilty of
I ask you to forgive me. You will hear from

CABINET MEETING
WIFE'S AGILITY
SAVES HER LIFE
LONDON. May 15.â Borne dramatic de
tails regarding- English action during the
(panic in American stocks have cone into
the possession of a representative cf tlM
Associated Press. It appears thst last
I Sunday the senior partner of the largest
j arbitrage concern summoned a meeting nt
â¢ a private house where Mr. Morgan, Lord
' Rothschild and others were present. He
' declared that if the buying In of Northern
Pacific shares was not stopped his firm
must announce themselves defaulters.
Scarcely were the words out of his mouth
before his hearers realized that such a
step would mean an immediate loss of
i.16.000,000 to the London Stock Kxchange.
Lord Rothschild and Mr. Morgan, con
trary to all the rules of Capel Court,
. pledged their word that there ivou.d be no
further buying in of Northern Pacific.
Narrow Escape of Many Houses.
It is generally realized that if this arbi
trage concern had not been able to get
its needs met London would have felt the
Â¦ effects for three years and houses whose
rames are historic world have been com
pelled to go to the wall, despite the fact
t'nat none of the parties in question had
taken any serious initiative in the fight
Lctwc-en the Amerirari roads.
At Sunday's meeting", when the situa
tion v.\is presented in all gravity. Lord
Rothschild said:
"L-onuon must be saved." and when those
present asreod that the buying in of
Ncrthcrn Pacifies must be stopped he re
marked "Wo have gained the day."
One of the leading London stock brok
f is fa'.d to-day:
"The whole development of the last few
(lays merely shows how much we are in
the nower of New York."
The Daily Telegraph's financial article
this morning says:
"If tt-.e rival groups arrange their dif
lrrenc<?s the real values of the different
American securities will remain the same
as befcre the panic occurred, since the
prosperous conditions on which the re
cent advances were based still exist."
Compromise Will Follow.
XEW YORK. May 15.â The Press trill
fav to-mcrrow: Compromise will follow
the test if or control of the Northern Pa
cific. One faction has control of the ma
j ferity of the common and preferred
shares together, while the other faction
has absolute control of a majortiy of the
common shares, the directorate and the
properly. The question to be discussed
pending the compromise will be a legal
one and hinges upon two interesting and
n*Tvel issues.
Under the articles of incorporation "the
company" has a right to retire the pre
ferred stock. Just what "the company"
is the contestants must decide*. If "the
company'' includes the directors and the
common stockholders, the Morgan party
can retire the preferred stock, thus wiping
art even a chance of a majority stock
holders' vote by the Kuhn-Loeb-Harrl
rrtin-Stillman combination.
It is the ceneral acceptance among rail
road bankers that for this reason control
of the property still rests absolutely with
the firm of Morgan & Co. and its associ
ates.

', W, F. Darling, superintendent of the
San Lorenzo Water Company, committed
suicide at 5:30 o'clock this morning at his
residence in Haywards by shooting him
self in the head with a revolver, instantly
killing himself. !
The deed was the result of despondency
caused in part by ill-health brought on by
intoxicants. In which Darling had been
heavily indulging of late.
Shortly before Darling ended his life his
daughter went to his bedroom to greet
him, as' was her custom. He kissed the
young woman and bade her good-by. As
she stepped out and closed the door Dar
ling pulled the pistol from under his pll
le(w, where he had concealed it, and plac
ing the muzzle at his head, pulled the
trigger. - t-
Miss Darling heard the shot and rushed
back to the room, only to find her father
dead.
He had been complaining to friends dur
ing fits of despondency and had threat
ened in the hearing of Town Trustee
Bruner to shoot himself.
His wife and daughter resided with Dar
ling at his home on B street. They moved
to Haywards from Marysville eight-years
ago.' He was eonnected ', there, as here,
with the water Â¦ works. Darling was a
member of Eucalyptus Lodge of Masons
and of Sycamore Lodge of Odd Fellows,
both of Haywards. He was a veteran of
the civil war,, and sixty-three yeara of
age.

-A startling example " of the * difference
between man-power and^the power of the
machinery man Invents and controls is
given in the Engineering Magazine. The
20,000 horsepower of an Atlantic â¢ liner's
engines . converted ; . into human muscle
power would represent an Immense, army.
To run night and day there would have
to be three relays of > men at the tread
milr or other appliance which would be
used. Each eight-hour shift at each 10,000
horsepower engine would be 100,000 men,
or 200,000 for the two engines. Three
shifts of 200,000 men would give -below
decks a population of a city of second
grade. If the problem, moreover; were
put In the form of high speed transporta
tion, such as is represented by. the loco
motive condition. It disappears practically
In the field of the unthinkable. Yet how
easily a few men handle, guide and con-'
trol that enormous power! If It would
require 200,000 men to furnish 20,000 horse
power day and night, try to figure but the
numerical' strength of the- army that
would be represented by the motive power
of all the railroads, steamers, factories
and mills of the United States.
Comprising Costs of Police Force.
â¢Berlin, with a population of > 1,843,000,
gets along with an outlay of. $2,500,000 for
its police force. Chicago, witha popula
tion 144,000 smaller, spends about $3,500,
000. Berlin's outlay secures the services
of 7500: officers, whose vigilance, in
the enforcement of the laws and ordi
nances makes - that capital s the; cleanest
and most orderly in the world. -Chicago's
money goes to less than half -as many
men, part of whose time only is -given to
enforcing the laws, the other part being
spent in winking at violations thereof.
Yet Chicago has as manyâ nay. â¢ probably
more â men of brains than Berlin.- The
trouble is that. too many of these fancy
they see a * personal advantage to them
selves in a' continuance- of - the present . or
der of things, and for such advantage are
willing to see the general good sacrificed.

Meanwhile Congress and the ' Stato

foot of public forest, and, in the interests
of all tne'pfeople, should resist every en
croachment? of .local, selfishness.â Chicago

The American Lumberman recently pub
lished some figures which should â¢- stir
legislatures and Congress, to prompt .'ac
tion for the preservation of our forests.
They should also move, owners of forest
lands and all men living by the lumber
trade ' to consider whether â¢ self-interest
should : not at last ; arouse them â¢ to pre
vent, the speedy destruction of their in
dustry. . Â¦ ' - ' â¢'_ ' , v
In 1890 the States, of Michigan, Wiscon
sin- and Minnesota produced 8,597,000,000
feet Of pine lumber. Since then the proa-'
uct has steadily declined, and/in 1900. was
but 5,483,261,000 feet. During the. last two
years prices of lumber- have been high,
and there. has beenevery inducement for
the mills N to turn out a heavy product.
Every resource has been strained, but
without- avail. The trees could not be
found. ".The end of the whitepine indus
try of the Northwest is almost at hand.
The years of its greatness are already
passed. ' ' â¢ \
We doubt If history records another
such shameful waste of natural wealth as
has been made In. the American forests.
The greater part of these resources is
gone forever, but something can still be
saved. The method which promises most
permanent results is the education of for
est owners to an appreciation of their own
real interests. When, they once realize
that . a forest, with proper management,
can be made as continuously productive
as a wheat field, they .will perhaps be
moved to' prudent action.'.' ' Â¦Â¦ ' -. Â¦'..-, " t

Great interest is taken in the fight for
the location of the next meeting place of

claims that its advantages are superior

At .that time Reilly" said Mrs. * I^entlvo
of Richmond, Va., who was the only eye
witness to the fatal shootlnff. corrobor
ated Stokes. Reilly's testimony virtually
disposed of the State's case, as it was
known from affidavits made at the tima
of the shooting that the evidence of Mrs.
Lentive would tend to exculpate Stokes.
Senator Stokes took the stand and ex
plained how Woll was killed. There were
no other witnesses for the defense.
â¢The shooting was the outcome of Dr.
Woll's sensational sermon, in which Wil
liamson society came under the sharp
lash of the preacher's invective. The
theory of the- prosecution was that Stokes
sought the minister in his own house and
demanded an apology and provoked a
quarrel, in which Woll was killed. But
the first witness put on thÂ« stand failed
to bear out that hypothesis. Otis Reilly
was - within a hundred and fifty yards
and at thefirst sound of the pistol*
rushed toward the scene of the affray.
There he found Stokes, although shot
twice, still standing with smoking re
volver in hand, and In reply to a ques
tion 1 Stokes said:
"Woll shot me twice and. I had to kill
him." . .

It may be said that the rural free 'delivery
service has passed from Its Infancy and has
reached the years of a healthy boy,' Just the
time when he needs the closest attention and
care of his watchful parentB. ' I arnMn a posi
tion to kÂ»jw that the rural free delivery ser
vice to-day Is receiving the closest and most
careful consideration of our honored chief,' and
under his vigilant eye this bouncing boy will
grow into youth and manhood, and become
eventually^ the sturdy giant of our postal ser
vice. MsiWjaRiiflS^HnHwtinHw
The magnificent success the eerrtcB ban (bits
Passed From Its Infancy.
It causes a betterment or social Intercourse
by quick , mall communication In the cojfctry
and between the country and the â¢ city, pro
ducing results of incalculable good to the pub
lic at large. In short, my friends, . rural free
delivery is the ,; city clasplnir hands with the
country and drawing: its country cousins into
a closer and more satisfactory .relationship.
Every rural letter carrier is an animatedâ a
living postofflce, so to speak. Besides perform
ing the ordinary duties of a letter carrier he
l>ostmarks the letters ho collects,' sells stamps,
registers letters and receives applications for
money orders, and then, on his own account,
renders for his patrons such other services as
do not conflict with his official duties.
Rural free delivery . means the dissemination
of knowledge on a scale heretofore unheard of
through a greatly Increased circulation of news
papers and periodicals in rural communities. It
places the daily market reports. â¢ weather fore
casts and the news qf the day In the hands of
the farmer without* delay.
Although the new service is but two or
three years old it has already become an as
sured, permanent and expanding branch of
the fostal system, and it Is only a question
of time and executive celerity until the whole
people of the United States may have their
mail delivered at their very dooi steps.
What I have ssen in your beautiful State
convinces me. that there are few others which
I>resent the natural advantages for the uni
versal extension of free delivery. Now, what
is rural free delivery? A queer cruestlon, in
deed, to ask in a company of r>ostal officials,
yet few not directly connected with the intro
duction and management of the service know
that rural free delivery stands for. more than
the mere delivery and collection of ordinary
mail. It means the expansipn of our postal
svbtem in all its branches: the extension of
every postal facility to the home of the
farmer. .
The very rapid extension of rural free de
livery surpasses all previous records in the
development of the postal service. .The first
route was established on October 15, 1896. On
July 1. 1897, there were but forty-three routes
in operation. Twelve months later the record
shows about ninety; July 1, 1899. about 350;
last July, 1263; next July will find 4300 rural
carriers maklnz daily delivery to 3,500,000 peo
ple, and by July L 1902, 'the service will num
ber at least S600 routes, serving over one-third
of the accessible rural population of the coun
try. '., .,:. Â¦>./:
Rural Free Delivery.
The first movement for free delivery met with
considerable opposition, and we find that after
therlrst year the service was discontinued in
twenty-one, offices. AH opposition, however,
gradually disappeared, and to-day there is an
almost universal . demand for the service.
In the year 18S3 one-fortieth of the appro
priation for the postal service was devoted to
free delivery. The appropriation for the ensuing
fiscal year for the maintenance of both - city
and rural delivery amounts to about twenty
one millions of dollars, or more than one-sixth
of the total appropriation. This amount equals
the entire postal revenues of the year of 1872.
To-day the amount annually paid for thÂ»
transportation of letter carriers on street cars
exceeds the first appropriation for the entire
frÂ«>e delivery service.
It is only a sense uf modesty that keeps
me from claiming that the free delivery ser
vice is the most important branch of our de
partment. I may safely claim, however, and
I believe the honorable members of the Housp
of Representatives who are seated around this
festal board agree with me, that since the
addition of the rural free delivery feature the
system bas become the most popular branch
of our great postal organization. Â¦ .
Like all other Innovations and new depart
ures the free delivery service had a small
beginning and considerable opposition.
A. W. Machen, superintendent of free
delivery, was Â£text introduced to respond
to the toast, "The Free Delivery System,
City and Rural." In part he said:
Now, gentlemen. It Is past 12 o'clock; I want
to say to you here to-night, as I have said
to a great many of you before, I will be
pleased to see you year after year still using
that same energy, still having that interest
in the public service to further the best in
terests of the postofflce In your community,
in the communities where you reside, that
you now have, and continue your pride in
making the Â¦ postoffice of- San Francisco and
the postofflces in the surrounding towns the
equal of any postoffices in the United States.
(Applause.)
lions. Â¦ In 1900 it had increased to seventy-six
millions. The wealth in 1790 was reported to be
two billions. The wealth in 1900 eighty billions.
The number of postofflces In 1780, with its
four millions of people, was 75. In 1300 it had
grown until there were 17,691. The postal
revenues in 1790 were $37,975. In 1930, $102,351,
579 29. The increase of population in 110 years
has been 19 to 1; In wealth 40 to 1; in post
offices 1000 to L (Applause.) Revenue of pos
tal service l 2700 to 1 (applause), which markb
In golden letters the progress of a natlon^a
nation gTeat and strongâ that is intelligent and
communicates one to the other. Postal ser
vice is necessary to civilization, and in this
country to a gTeater degree than any other
the people patronize the postofflce department.
You refer to the postal department as the
greatest business institution in the world.
Yes, when you contemplate the great army of
employes, the millions and millions of dollars
handled every year; when we stop to think how
few of those dollars stick to the fingers of
the employes, you must be forcibly reminded
of the honesty and Integrity of the average
employe of the postal service of this country.
(Applause.)
I ran across tome figure* the other day â I do
not know who is the father of them. Ther
were of interest to me and marked the progress
of the postal service of this countryâ a postal
service inferior to no other on the face of the
jrlobe. (Applause.) A' postal service more eco
nomically manared than any postal service on
the face of the globe. When we contemplate
that two-thirds of the matter we handle and
distribute is handled and distributed for the in
significant eum of about three and a half mil
lions, and the deficit Â» mo email, one must ne
cessarily be astonished in the economy In the
administration of the postal service. Our
postal service to-day will return to us a sur
plus cf many millions of dollars. In 1730 the
iic.u'.ation of the United States was four mil-
Progress of the Service.
It meant hard times for this country and
r-very man. woman an<l child had it brought
home to his own hearthstone. The next year
was the first year of your fiscal administra
tion. Times began to change. The receipts
began to increase. Our deficit began to grow
emaller. â¢ I do not know what you are going
to do this year. You Iiave done more than I
ever anticipated. But. of course we are on
the up-grade â business is Increasingâ every
man in the festal service . now is 'doing his
utmost, is. doing more than any man should
do by reason of the enormous and unpre
cedented growth of our service. Congress has
been . liberal in 41s appropriations to your de
partment the last two or three years. '. We
have â¢ given all you asked. Congress thought
it was a lavish appropriation of money, yet
the enormous increase ot receipts following and
increasing month by month has demonstrated
to us that increasing , as we , have in the
amount appropriated we have been unable to
appropriate enough .to run the sen-ice. Â¦
Congress occupies a unique position. It
etandK. as it were, between the people and Jts
servants. Â«-fco diEpense the public money col
lected by means of taxation from the sweat
of the faces of the many millions of people
who contribute their mite to make up the hun
dreds cf millions that are expended annually.
It is our function to restrain. To-night I am
cailed ujx>n to resuond. and I am not pre
pared. Great men like you and I need not be
prepared. (Laughter.) I do not know how you
do; I always do better when I am not pre
pared.
"The pcctal sen-ice of the United States as
a factor in our national growth." I have not
yet even cot fo far In my toast as to ascer
tain whether the postal service Is a factor in
our national growth or the national growth is
a factor in the rwstal service. There is one
thing, however, the postal service is the best
evidence of the j>rogre66 and prosperity that
th!Â« or any other country may have. You re
member In the dark days of 1S?6 and 1S97 when
in the year ending June 30,, 18%, the postal re
ceipts were less than they were for the fiscal
year end ins June 30. 1SS5.
After some preliminary and very com
plimentary remarks directed to the Post
master General personally. Congressman
Loud continued as follows:
Congressman Loud was next introduced
to tell of "The Postal Service of the
United States as a Factor in Our National
Growth."
Loud Is Humorous.
For years he has earnestly sought and labored
to check the abuses which have grown up in
fcecend -class mail matter. And I undertake to
eay that r.o man in Congress has more zeal
ously devoted himself to a better work than
Mr. Loud has done In consecrating himself to
that cause. (Applause.) He has ne^er had the
full measure ot success in its achievement to
which he was entitled and which the cause
itsflf deserved, but I do not believe that he
v-ili abate his zeal in that sood work and I
think X may whisper that the department will
try to co-operate. <Ai.plause.) And if legisla
tion shall not be altogether successful we will
try to t;ee â we do not know how much success
can be achievedâ but we will try to see what
can be accomplished in that direction by ad
ministrative methods. (Applause.)
And during the next two years we shall
more than double it, and I believe â I do not
know what my dietinjjuiehed friend who sits
In Congress and who puts the check on us will
tayâ but for my part, tpeaking for once with
freedom (laughter), I believe that we shall so
establish and fix this system within the com
ing year that no power in this country. Â¦ in
Congress or anywhere else, can prevent us
from carrying the postal service to these twen
ty millions of people scattered over a million
square miles* of territory. (Applause.) And
there is another thought to be associated with
that. My distinguished friend, llr. Louc], is
somewhat known throughout the country in
connection with a bill to which casual and
occasional reference hag been made as the
"Loud bill." (Applause.)
This eervlce in great cities like San Fran
cisco is splendid. There Is no better aiiywhere
in the world, but San Francisco, New York,
Philadelphia and Chicn?o are not all of this
great country of ours. Spreading, as It does,
uvtr Its wide expanse of three thousand miles
in breadth; It covers a vast area of territory
not so thickly settled and the postal service
must keep its eye on those who live upon the
farm as well ss upon those who live In the
toivns. (Applause.) We have carried under
our system the postoffice to the doors of more
than three millions of people who live in the
cities and towns, but It is for us yet to carry
the post&ffice to the doors of more than twenty
millions who live over a million square miles
of territory upon the farms and through the
rural regions of the United States. (Applause.)
Ihiring the past two years we have extended
rural free delivery in this country over a ter
ritory greater than the .entire area of England.
Vi'e have done it in two years and have not
made much fuss about it. (Applause.)
Service Is Splendid-
done much, but there ie much yet to do. Our
Â¦watchword must ever be "Onward." I have
no us* for a Postmaster General or for a pos
tal official who believes that we have yet
reached the hlgrhest place and says that noth
ing more Is to be done. Our watchword. I re
peat, is "Onward," and we must carry this
service forward to a still higher standard.
There are some treat measures of broad pol
icy connected with this eervice to which we
cannot be indifferent.
I do not know why you jump me up. who am
not a. talker, when, there are so many brilliant
speakers here, but I have made It a rule of
life in my profession at: least to make a 'try
at anything: that has j been set for me to do.

to assist you in welcoming these gentlemen

Not only that, gentlemen, but certainly we
have just cause to be grateful to the splendid
Onio 4 representatives in the Congress of the
united States who have also honored us with
.their presence within. the borders of this State,
because among- those representatives are to

free to say which on this occasion. (Renewed
laughter.) Oregon is relatively a new country.
H has not been very many years comparatively
since our fathers first began to settle the green
slopes and the fertile valleys of that Western
country- which has become a part of our great
union . of States. The history of Oregon now
forms an important part of the .history of our
common country. WhilÂ° this is true it is also
true that these are the closing years of the
century since the great Jefferson, with re
markable foresight, . formed â¢ and sent out the
famous Lewis and Clarke expedition, which
practically discovered the , Oregon country, and
I or more than forty years the Oregon question
was of national importance. â¢ '; :
The object of Jefferson, prirr rily perhaps,
was not the acquisition of more territory for
purposes of immediate Â¦ settlement, Â¦ because at
that'tlme there were literally millions of acres
of unoccupied fertile land to be had In the
Mississippi Valley; -but if I may be permitted,
to say this In the presence of my loyal Cali
fornia frJends, Jefferson himself eaid - that he
had the idea. that somewhere in the Western
country there must be a' great waterway bear
ing still westward from the mountain -chains
on. tho .Pacific Coast that would ultimately.be
the gateway for the great -traffic that will
finally spring up between : this nation and' the
Orient. . This I trust, will not interfere with
the prospects and the hopes of the people of
S&rj Francisco. (Laughter.). \ -Â¦

this great trade . of which we are all proud.

was composed of the flower of its young man

far attained is the pride of the present pro
gressive administration. The broad-minded
policy of our Postmaster General in promptly
and successfully executing the law providing
for the introduction of rural free delivery will*
mark his administration of the postal service
as the greatest In the history of the depart

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Is more common than we may think, if
Â¦we define gluttony as eating beyond the
body's need of 'sustenance and beyond
the stomach's capacity for digestion and
assimilation of food. .That is a fair
definition, and it fastens the name glut-
ton on many a- person who would resent,
the term as an insult. The fact of this
gluttony is marked by its consequences.
The overloaded â¢ stomach becomes dis-
eased. The popular term for the condi-
tion is " weak " stomach. The " weak r -.
stomach fails in furnishing adequate nu-.
trition for the body, and soon the g weak- 1
Â¦ness" spreads from the stomach to other
organs. . . ,
Dr.' Fierce r s Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion â¢ and nutrition. It
enables the perfect assimilation of food,
by which alone the health and strength
of the body is maintained. . v

cannot praise it too highly," Â¦writes Mrs. C. L. ,

how. I felt~when I toot it ; I was suffering every-
thing with indigestion . and my stomach was so

My husband said he was going for the | doctor,
but I said if he would get me a bottle of the
'GoHen Medical Discovery' I would try "that. .
I had not taken it long when I felt relieved, and ij
have not had a touch of indigestion or stomach
trouble since. I had been sick for four years,
and less . than ' four - bottles cured me. Some
people that knew me before I began to take the >
