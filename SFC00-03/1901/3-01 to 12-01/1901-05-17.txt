SCENES IN FRONT OF, THE; RESIDENCE OF HENRY T.' SCOTT AT CLAY
' . AND LAGUNA STREETS, WHERE THE STRICKEN TVIFE OF PRESI
DENT McKINLEY LIES IN. A" VERY CRITICAL CONDITION. .
Hundreds of telegraphic messages were
delivered at the house during the morn
ing, and there were many distineuished
callers before the noon hour. The va
rious members of the Cabinet drove up
to the house, some of them being ac
companied by their ladies. General
Shafter, attended by an aid. called at
the house, but he' did not see.the.Presi
dent. The face of the distinguished sol
dier bore a sad look as he turned from
the porch of the Scott residence and
entered his carriage. The. President
had desired that he be excused from re
ceiving his old friend. Rear Admiral
Gasey of the navy and Lieutenant Com
mander Phelps, the personal naval aid
to the President, also called "at the
As the sun rose behind the hills and
cast brilliant rays over the city the vi
tality of Mrs. McKinley seemed to
strengthen, and for a brief space she
recovered consciousness. At 10:30 a. m.
the information was given out that Mrs.
McKinley was holding her own and that
no change had been noted in the past
two hours.
Shortly after dawn a slight improve
ment was noted by the attending- phy
sicians. When the first symptoms of
the sinking spell were noticed urgent
messages were sent to Drs. Hirschfelder
and Gibbons, and they soon arrived at
the Scott residence.
The weary hours preceding the dawn
of day were passed in the ereatest
anxiety by those surrounding the bed
side of Mrs. McKinley. The President
remained by the couch of his* wife and
waited with fortitude for the dread sum
mons to his beloved one.
It was learned later that Mrs. Mc-
Kinley had suffered a sinking spell, and
heart stimulants were resorted to in or
der to keep her alive. As soon as pos
sible messages were sent to the members
of the President's Cabinet and to some
of the President's relatives residinjr in
this city.
At an early hour yesterday morning
Dr. Rixey, the President's physician.
hastily summoned the chief executive to
the bedside of his wife. The President
responded and remained in the sick
room the greater part of the day.
All that medical science can do was
done yesterday for the gentle patient,
but though every slight rally in Mrs.
McKinley's condition was hailed by
some as a good sign, the medical men
attending the sufferer shook their heads
and declined to give any hope.
The brief and infrequent bulletins as
to the condition of Mrs. McKinley have
failed to carry any hope to the people
of the country, and the fear is strong
that their chosen head is to be bowed
down by irreparable loss.
The President is bravely facing his
sorrow, but his face betrays the agony
of mind and heart that has come to him
in the past few days.
Not alone from the broad confines of
the American republic but from remote
corners of the world messages of sym
pathy were flashed to the city by
the Golden Gate, all bearing: the heart
felt hope that Providence might spare
the gentle life of the lady of the White
House and -assuage the jrrief of. the na
tion's head and his fellow subjects.

No demonstration marked the ap

streets yesterday. He emerged from the
Scott home at 3:15 p. m.. He was ac
companied by Henry T. Scott and some
of the members of the Cabinet.
The President's face was wan and
tired, and though he tried to 'smile
bravely it was the effort of a brave man
trying to hide his .sorrow. There were
deep circles around the President's eyes
and his face was of dull pallor. He had
a kind acknowledgment for the salutes
of the police and detectives as he passed
from the house to Lacuna street and
crossed into the park facing the resi
dence. :The public was not allowed to
approach the President in the park, but
op the streets in the vicinity the chief
executive shook the hands of those who
met him and gave him greeting.

you, the President's private
secretary. They tell the story
of the day's hopes and fears.
The first of these bulletins was issued
by Mr. Cortelyou at half-past Q o'clock,
after the physicians had' been in consul
tation. It was:
"At 9 o'clock the doctors report that
Mrs. McKinley's condition is not so fa
vorable.- she having had a sinking spell
at 5 o'clock this morning. There will
.noi^-be another official - bulletin runt:!
noon. President McKinley has canceled
every,engagcment for the ,day." â¢
At 11:45 a.m. Secretary Cortelyou
made the following statement:
I "The physicians have been most of
the morning with Mrs. McKinley. and
report that while she has had no relapse
during the morning her condition con
tinues grave. She is not suffering, but
is very weak."
â Secretary Cortelyou stated at 1:43
? m. that there had been no change in
Mrs. McKinley's condition. She was
still very weak!
At 2:10 p! m. Secretary Cortelyou
stated that there had been no material
change in Mrs. McKinlev's condition.
She was conscious at that time* but was
extremely weak.
Secretary Cortelyou stated at 3:1s
p. m. that Mrs. McKinley was resting
easy. There was no appreciable change
in her condition for the better. She was
conscious and recognized the President
arid Miss Barber.
At 5:15 p. m. the following statement
was made:
"Secretary Cortelyou says there has
been no change in Mrs. McKinley/s con
dition since the last bulletin. No more
bulletins will be^issued after 6 o'clock."
At 8:15 Secretary Cortelyou gave out
the following: ,
"There is no material chansre in Mrs.
McKinley's condition. If anything she
is better than during the afternoon."
The next bulletin was issued at 8:45
p. m. It was much more encouraging
in tone, and was as follows:
"Physicians in attendance report de
cided improvement. Patient resting
easy. Pulse and temperature satisfac
tory."

SAN FRANCISCO, OFRIDAY^~M^:Y 17-1901.
VOLUME LXXXIXâ NO. 168.
AT 2 o'clock this morning it was given out at the Scott residence that while no material change was noted in the condition of Mrs^McKinley she was considered so near to the point of death that the attending physicians
could furnish no reassuring information.
The critical hours from 2 a. m. until 6 a. m. to-day give the physicians the gravest concern, and if their patient survives this designated period she must live through another day before any hopes can be held
out for her ultimate recovery. V . , !
Heart stimulants have constantly been resorted to and the physicians have administered opiates to check the acute, symptoms' that have- brought Mrs. McKinley to the point of dissolution. Mrs. McKinley suf
fers no pain. \
At brief intervals Mrs. McKinley has regained consciousness and has recognized her husband. \
ShouIcL Providence spare the life of the President's wife the Chief Executive will start with her as soon as possible for Washington.
Affairs of state may require that Secretaries Hay and Long proceed to the capital^
Statements that the President may take part in public and social functions in this city and at other points have no' foundation and -itcan be stated emphatically that the Chief Executive has canceled every future
engagement planned for the Presidential tour. ;. ::;;.:' '

ing knock-out drops to John Sexton,' an
old miner who lives in Fresno. Yesteiday
forenoon the youthful prisoners met Sex
ton on Market street and took him for a
ride to Golden Gate Park. At their invi
tation he visited a saloon near the park
and, after being served with a "lass of
beer one of the boys poured a portion of
the contents of a phial of knockout drops
in the glass. Realizing Ms condition,
Sexton left his companions and boarded a
passing car. Last night he again met
Turner and Miller, who were evidently
looking for him, and accompanied them to
the Louvre, at the corner of ( Eddy and
Powell streets. Suspecting that they in
tended to administer a larger dose of the
deadly drops to him, he concluded to care-Â«
fully watch them. Just as they were
served with the drinks Turner and Miller,
seeing Officer Mulcahey entering the
place started to make their escape. With
the assistance of Officer David they were
overtaken and placed under v arrest, lur
ner had a bottle containing knockout
drops with him, but when taken Into cus

CHICAGO, May 16.â A clash between the
National Metal Trades Association j . and
the International Association of Machin
ists threatens to undo all the work that
has been done looking toward a peaceful
settlement of the labor, question so far as
the Chicago district is concerned. The
employers in the Metal Trades Association
say r they, have conceded that nine hours
shall constitute a day's work and that
they ' will only too gladly, agree - to arbi
trate' the question of wages, but that con
trary to instructions, voted Saturday
night by the machinists' Chicago associa
tion, their agent, Roderick,- has not yet
asked for arbitration. \ "* Â¦ -- .;Â¦ Â¦
"The manufacturers are playing
double," said Roderick. "They are trying
to defeat us by using the independent
manufacturers, and - until we | hear . from
them as to the result of their, meeting to
day I cannot predict the action." ..

FESTIVITIES PLANNED FOR DAY ABAMDONRP
AND CITY GIVEN OVER TO SORROWFUL VIGIL
INSTEAD of a day's festivities in
celebration of the presence of the
President as the city's guest, and
of memorable events by way of
entertainment of distinguished
guests, there was a hush of sor
row over San Francisco yesterday. The
members of the Presidential party were
in retirement, touched * by the sad
thought of an impending bereavement
for their chief, and San Francisco had
thought only of the sick lady of the
White House and her grief-stricken
husband.
None of the receptions and banquets
arranged for were held. When the
critical condition of Mrs. McKinley
became known officers and committees
of the various interested organizations
hastened into conference and sent out
notices that their entertainment plans
were abandoned.
In the evening the illumination of the
. downtown streets was only partial, and
interest in it was half-hearted. On pre
vious evenings The Call buildine was
admired by thousands for the classic
beauty of Its scheme of illumination,
but last night the building was not illu
minated, out of respect to the sorrow
that has come upon the President, in
whose honor the illumination was pre
pared.
The trip to Mount Tamalpais had
been definitely abandoned the evening
before, the members of the Cabinet hav
ing announced that they could not be
guests under the circumstances.
General James M. Gleaves and
Colonel W. H. Jordan, president and
vice president respectively of the Ohio
Society, had a consultation early in the
morning, and after Colonel Jordan had
made a trip to the Scott residence and
conferred with Secretary Cortelyoui
they met with members of the commit
tee and decided to abandon the banquet
at the Palace Hotel, for which such
elaborate preparations had been made.
The women of the Ohio Society had
previously decided not to attempt to
give their banquet at the California Ho
tel for the > kuiies of the Presidential
party.
The events scheduled for the after
noon were abandoned one by one, as
those in charge had time to meet and
reach such decision officially. These
events were the reception to have been
tendered at the Palace Hotel at 2:30
p. m. by the Sons and Daughters of the
American Revolution, the reception at
Native Sons' Hall by the Mexican War
Veterans, Loyal Legion, Native Sons
and Native Daughters, and the reception
to have been tendered the ladies of the
Presidential party at the Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art.
The Knights Templar parade and re
ception was declared off by the follow
ing order:
"Owing to the state of Mrs. McKin
ley's health all orders promulgated con
cerning the reception of the President
on Friday at Mechanics' Pavilion are
rescinded. H. D. LOVELAND.
Commander.
"THEO. FROLICH. Recorder.
Golden Gate Commanderv."
The directors of the Leasrue of the
Cross Cadets met in the afternoon and
voted to postpone the competitive drill
at Mechanics' Pavilion, to have been
held to-night, out of sympathy for
President McKinley, wh6 ( had given
consent to attend for a short time and
review the cadets. Notice will be given
those holding invitations when another
date is selected.
The committee in charge of the citi
zens' banquet for to-morrow night have
abandoned that function.
TRAVEL DIVERTED
TO PREVENT NOISE
At noon Chief of Police Sullivan and
Captain Wittman sent for a squad of
police and barred all travel on the
blocks surrounding the house where
Mrs. McKinley lies stricken almost unto
death. Only the newspaper representa
tives were allowed to approach the
Scott home, and the crowds that had
congregated on the opposite side of the
street were forced to take up their vigril
in the middle of the park facing the
house.
Secretary Cortelyou issued another
bulletin at noon that informed the eaRer
watchers for news that Mrs. McKinley
was not suffering, but was very low.
.At i p. m. Bishop Nichols -of the
Episcopal church arrived at the house
and was admitted to the sickroom.
He remained with Mrs. McKinley for
some time and when he left he informed
the newspaper representatives that the
patient was in a critical condition but
that the doctors still had hopes for her
recovery. The Bishop's kindly face was
pale and sad and his voice was 'choked
with emotion as he, told of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley's condition.
At 2 p. m. Secretary Cortelyou issued
another, bulletin, but its tenor was simi
lar to the previous one. During the next
hour the physicians left the. house and
Secretary Cortelyou announced that a
slight improvement had been noted in
Mrs. McKinleys' condition.
Carriage after carriage drove up, and
the police and . detective guards were
busily engaged in carrying cards into

ROBS THE MAN
WHO FAVORS HIM
Why Two Missionaries
"Were Slain in New '
Guinea.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 16.â Details
have been brought by the steamer Moana
from Sydney of the massacre of the mis
sionary ' party In New Guinea briefly re
ported by cable on May 8. The report to
the Government Resident of Thursday
Island is as follows:
The crew of the Dido . report the murder of
Rev. James Chalmers and Rev. Â¦ Oliver Tom
kins of the' London Missionary Society by
New Guinea natives at Debe, near the mouth
of tho Fly River. It sÂ«ma they went ashore
after friendly natives had warned them of the
tribal war that was In progress and that their
lives would be endangered. Despite this warn
ing the missionaries, with six native converts,
went ashore and attempted to hold a religious
service. The natives blamed the missionaries
for a reverse In battle and killed the two
white men and all their native boys. Parts ct
the bodies were afterward devoured by thÂ«
cannibal natives. The captain of the mission
schooner from his veggel saw tha bodies lyln*
on the beach with their heads cut off, but he
wan afraid to land, and galled away to DÂ«tru
Inland. Thli report of the I>ido'Â» crÂ«w has
been confirmed by a well-known native mis
sionary named IÂ»lal.
From other sources it wan learned that
Chalmers, who was one of the pioneer
missionaries u> New Guinea and known
and revered among the friendly tribes oa
"Tomatoe," was believed by the savage
tribo by whom he and Tomkins, a recently
arrived missionary, were murdered, to bo
endowed with divine power, and they de
manded that he aid them In destroying
the tribe whom they were at war with.
The missionaries refused to go with the
tribe into battle, and the missionary party
was kept under guard pending the out
come of a battle. In this flght their cap
tors were badly worsted and the daughter
of the old chief who. led the fighting
forces was severely and perhaps latally
wounded. For this reason she blamed
"Tomatoe" with adverse intercession with
the gods and demanded his death in expi
ation. Thereupon the natives killed the
missionaries, savagely hacking them to
pieces, and afterward devoured the bodies
at a midnight cannibal feast. â¢ _

The bloodshed came after a day of
peace. From c-arly morning the crowds
had melted away before bayonets and
shotguns, cars had been operated under
guard, and there was an impression that
the spirit of turbulence was waning.
There had been some minor demonstra
tions, particuiarly in North Albany, but
not a shot had been fired, and as the day
passed the running of cars attracted little
attention. The volley fired on Broadway
Bloodshed After Day of Peace.
William Walsh, a merchant, was killed.
The fatally injured are LeRoy Smith, a
merchant, shot by National Guardsmen,
and William Marshall, a non-union motor
man, skull fractured. Others most seri
ously injured are: George Booze, citizen,
cheek ripped open by bayonet; William
Rooney. citizen, shot by National Guards
men; Gilbert Hall, non-union motorman,
injured by mob.
One man killed, two other men fatally
wounded, hundreds of others with broken
heads and cut faces; cars running merely
as arsenals, with no patrons; the city
under martial rule, with its citizens in a
frenzy of excitement, and the city author
ities and leaders of the strikers trying to
get the railway company to come to an
amicable settlement, was the situation
when darkness put an end to the strife
growing out of the street-car strike to
night.
Meantime Major General Roe intends to
take every precaution and at midnight
ordered out the Ninth Regiment of New
York. It will arrive here to-morrow after
noon, 800 strong, and if the strike is not
settled will assist in opening up the other
lines of the traction company In this city.
With the addition of the Ninth Regiment
to-morrow there will be over 3000 Guards
men in Albany.
ALBANY./*. T., May 16.â Five hours of
conference to-night with all the warring
elements represented failed to settle the
Albany strike of street railway employes.
The strikers waived all the demands for
the removal of the non-union men. The
executive committee of the United Trac
tion Company will consider the proposition
in thÂ»j morning- and may accept it and
settle the strike.

DCRBAX. May IS.â In regard ' to the
Question raised in the House of Commons
as to whether Zulus had been employed
to raid Boer stock in the Vryheid district,
full details have been sent to the Right
Hon. James Bryce, member for the South
Dix-ision of Aberdeen, by a member of
the Natal Legislature. This statement
shows that this a dangero-uc employment;
that It is contrary to the policy of the
colony, and that it was done without con
sultation with the civil or native authori
ties. The protests of the Prime Minister
Â¦were unavaling and the proceeding is
6trong-ly resented. It is believed here that
Bome officers exceeded their instructions.
At daybreak mounted scouts, composing
a. part of the garrison, made a sortie,
â¢while at the same time the British opened
fire with Nordenfeldts on the Boers, who
scattered. Colonel Tupper followed the
retreating burghers until nigrhtfall, when
the chase was abandoned. One scout
was severely wo-unded.
Later advices are to the effect that the
Boers are still in the vicinity of Kraii
Pan.
CAPE TOWX, May 16.â Four parties of
Boers visited Krail Pan, south of ilafe
klng. Cape Colony, on the morning of
May 10. During the night they took a
position on the kopje from which the
Boer suns opened fire on October 12, ltfÂ«9.
They pillaged the natives who were living
en the kopje, killing two and seriously
wounding three others. Then they creot

by a squad of Twenty-third infantrymen,
in which LeRoy Smith and William
Walsh, well-known citizens, fell mortally
wounded, cnanged all that. It stirred
anew the feeling of hatred as the excited
tidings swept through the city, and the
Guardsmen were bitterly denounced.
Neither of the men had been guilty of any
offense, but were caught in a crowd some
member of which had stoned the Guards
men, and by mischance were hit. The
disturbance was not a serious one, and
murder is the title applied by inflamed
public sentiment to the shooting. The
Guardsmen seem but to have followed
their orders, for they were under orders
to shoot if assaulted.
The bright prospect of a settlement of
the strike has not served to allay the
growth of vindictive feeling,' and if the
present situation continues acts of bitter
revenge and violence may be expected.
It was on the last run of the soldiers
on the cars that the tragedy of the day
occurred. The cars Â¦were on Broadway
moving' northward and a constantly
swelling crowd was gathered about Union
Station. The first of the workday folk
had been released by the whistles that
sounded through the manufacturing dis
trict, and they were pouring into the
crowd. Near Columbia street - a truck
blocked the way of a car and, urged on
by the crowd, the driver refused to move
on as speedily as desired. Some one in
the crowd threw a stone, but it went wide
of its mark. The crowd was noisy and
there was much confusion. The car fin
ally moved forward into the next block,
and another stone was hurled at It.
Shots Fired by the Militia.
There was a sharp command, and as the
car slowed down four shots were fired
from it. -
LeRoy Smith lounged on the steps of his
store; William Walsh, his business neigh
bor from across the street,' was his imme
diate companion, and a small crowd hung
about near them. It was Into this crowd
that the guardsmen fired at a range of
less than twenty feet. Smith and Walsh
were both shot, in the abdomen and fell
where they stood. A third man, William
Rooney, was slightly hurt by a glancing
bullet. Some of the guards stepped from
the car and reloaded their pieces. The
startled crowd fell back at the first shot,
and a moment later the guards sprang
SEATTLE, Wash, May 16.â Following
are private advices received by mail from
Sitka, Alaska, dated .May 11:
Drs.* Moore of Skaguay and Linhart of
Juneau have been investigating the small
pox epidemic at this place and the former
says there, is no doubt of the prevalence
of. the disease despite all reports to th&
contrary. The doctors visited all the In
fected districts, the Indian ranch, Rus
sian town and the Indian mission. .Â¦"â¢/
Dr. Moore was very outspoken regard
ing existing conditions. He said there
could be no question of the seriousness of
the situation. Smallpox, generally . in a
mild form, was prevalent, and owing to
the uncleanly condition of the ranch com
bat-'ng the sicKness would be a difficult
matter, â¢ <- â¢ ..
Â¦ In Russiantown there was but two
cases; one serious. At the mission there
were found over thirty children suffering'
from smallpox. They have been treated
in the hospital, which is located a con
siderable distance from the dormitories.
Up to the present time there have been
seven fatalities, all confined to the In
dians.
. A. rigid quarantine has been placed on
the ranch, Indian policemen guarding all
entrances to the inlected quarter. Guards
have kept visitors from the homes of the
two Russians who are sick. In the last
month vaccination was general. All mem
bers of the marine guard have been vac
cinated and among the citizens vaccina
tion has been compulsory.
aboard the car and were rapidly! wheeled
from the scene. Smith and Walsh were
hurried away to hospitals for surgical
care and the angry crowd swarmed in the
street to curse and denounce the guards
men. â¢ Walsh died at the hospital to
night. Smith Is a member of the shoe
manufacturing firm of Smith & Herrick,
and a citizen of wealth, respectability and
prominence. He is a member of the Al
bany Club and a whist expert of national
reputation. He is 50 years of age and has
a. family. Walsh was the head- of a
plumbing house and well known in busi
ness circles. Neither man had any part
other than as spectators in the demon
stration that pro%'oked the shooting.
Refrain From Further Slaughter.
The remainder of the cars made the
run to North Albany and back without
trouble, and when they reached Quail
street barn were housed for the night.
When the cars were all in, the guards in
the street were recalled.
The shooting of Smith and Walsh had
a very depressing etfect upon the mem
bers of the Twenty-third Regiment and
to-night, when stones were hurled at the
plcketmen around the Quail-street barn,
they did not fire in the dark. Two pri
vates were hit and hurt, but they did not
care to take a chance by firing-. It was
held by the officers and men generally
that the order to fire was entirely justi
fied, but there was general regret at the
consequences of the volley.

DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-BOOT.
Thousands of Women Have Kidney
Trouble and Never Suspect It.
To Prove What the Great Kidney Remedy SWAMP-ROOT Will Do for YOU, Every
Readerof "The Call" May Have a Sample Bottle FREE.
TO READERS OP THE CALL:
Si â¢ "About eighteen months ago I had a very severe spell of sickness. I was ex-
"tremely sick for three weeks,- and when I finally was able to leave my bed I was
left with excruciating pafns in my back. My water at times looked very like cof-
' fee. -.-I could 'pass but little at a time, and then only alter suffering great pain. My
condition was such that I had no . strength and was all run down. Tha
dootors said' my kidneys were not affected, and while I
' Did Not Kfjow I Had Kidney. Trouble,
â¢ I- somehow felt certain that my kidneys were the cause of my trouble. My sister.
..Mrs. C. E.'Llttlefleld of Lynn, advised mÂ© to give Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root a
trial. I procured a bottle, and inside of three days commenced to get relief. I fol-
lowed up that bottle with another, and at the completion of this one found I was
completely cured. My. strength returned and to-day I am as well as ever. My busi-
ness is that of canvasser, I am on my feet a great deal of the time and have to
use much energy in. getting around. My cure is therefore all the more remarkable
and is exceedingly gratifying to me." : .'<-.Â¦Â¦ *,-.

Swamp-Root So Pleasant to Take.

"For more than ten. years I suffered
with what the doctors termed female
trouble, also heart trouble, with swelling
of the feet arid limbs. Last summer, I felt
so .badly that T thought I had not long to
live. I consulted doctor after doctor and
took their medicines, buf felt no better. A
friend recommended me\ to try Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, and I must say I de-
rived immense benefit almost from the
first week. I continued the medicine, tak-.
Ing It regularly, and I am now In splendid
health. The pains and , aches have â¢ all
gone. I have recommended Swamp-Root
to all my friends, and told them what it
has done for me. \I will gladly answer any
one who desires to write me regarding my
case. I most heartily indorse Swamp-
Root from every standpoint. There is
such a pleasant taste to Swamp-Root, and
it goes right to the weak spots and drives
them out of the system." -

"Some doctors pronounced my case gall
stones, and said I could not live without
a surgical operation, to which I would
never consent. A friend suggested I try
Dr." Kilmer's Swamp-Root. I began to
take Swamp-Root regularly, and when I
had used only three 50-cent bottlea I felt
fine and "was able -to do more work than
I had 3one in four, years. It has made a
new. woman of me." I have had only one
slight- attack since I began -to take
Swamp-Root, and that was caused by be-
ing drenched with rain and catching cold.
Stomach trouble had bothered me for
years and had become chronic. I am now

than I did ten years ago.. I freely give
this testimonial for the benefit of those
who have suffered as I have."

Women as Well as Men Are Mad9
Miserable by Kidney and
j Bladder Troubles.
It used to be consiaered that only urin-
ary and bladder troubles were to be traced
to the kidneys, but now modern science
proves that nearly all diseases have their
beginning in the disorder of these most
Important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood-
that is their work. So when your kidneys
are weak or out of order you can under-
stand how quickly your entire body Is af-
fected and how every organ seems to fall
[ to do its duty.
f If you are sick or "feel badly ,** begin
taking the famous new discovery, Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Hoot, because as soon as
your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will
convince any one. Â»
Many women suffer untold misery
because the nature of their disease
is not correctly understood; in most
cases they are led to believe that
womb trouble or female weakness of
some sort is responsible for their
many ills, when in fact disordered
kidneys are the chief cause of their
distressing troubles.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy
or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache in thi
back, weakness or bearing down sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine,
with strong odor, frequent desire to pass
It night or day, Â¦with scalding or burning
sensation â these are all unmistakable
signs of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there Is any doubt In your mind as to
your condition, take from your urine oh
rising about four ounces, place it in s
glass or bottle and let it stand twenty-
four hours. If on examination It is milky
or cloudy, if there Is a brickdust settling,
or if small particles float about in it. your
kidneys are in need of immediate atten-
tion.
Other symptoms showing that you need
Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizziness,
irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow,
unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambition
but no strength.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and is
used in the leading hospitals, recommend-
ed by physicians In their private practice
and is taken by doctors themselves, fee-
cause they recognize in it the greatest
and most successful remedy that science
has ever been able to compound.
If ( you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular 50-cent and ?1 bottles
at the drugstores everywhere.

The great factors in the new system are

ships are commissioned.
"This, mind you. does not mean the or

WILL BE HIGHER BIDS
FOB STREET SWEEPING
Probability of Raise in Sweepers 1
Wages Will Increase the . q
Estimates.
The Board of Public Works Informed
the Board - of Supervisors yesterday that
the probability of a strike among the
street sweepers for higher wages will re
sult in high bids for the street sweeping
contract next Tuesday. The board has
asked the Supervisors for $200,000 to keep
the streets clean, and fears are expressed
that this amount will be too small by at
least $50,000 should the street sweepers win
their fight for $2 50 per day.
The sweepers are at present receiving $2
per day. and heretofore the contractors
who filed bids have figured their estimates
on that basis. As the Indications are that
the wages will be forced up to $2 50 the
contractors will undoubtedly .figure the in
crease in' the cost. There are more than
300 men affected and the Increase In wages
will represent In round numbers $50,000 for
the next fiscal year, which the contrac
tors will take into consideration.

his party East In case of the
death of the noble woman
now lying !11 at the Scott
residence.
Night and day the engine and cars
attached stand silently on a siding,
ready at hurried notice to take up their
sad burden of the dead and the mourners
and start on the long funeral run.
For more than an hour yesterday morn
ing Henry T. Scott was closeted with Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt of the South
ern Pacific Company, perfecting arrange
ments In anticipation of the sad event
jhat might at any time be announced. As
a result of this consultation the special
train Is at the mole. Master of Trans
portation Richardson was called in and
under his supervision the train was
nwde up.
It Is the intention of the President, In
the event of Mrs. McKinley's death, to
lose no time in taking the body East* and
the visit of Henry T. Scott to the railroad
building and the subsequent arrangements
were no doubt made at the personal re
quest of the President.
Should the sad Journey be made the
same precautions will be used to prevent
accidents as were taken In the tour of the
Presidential party from the East. The
special will have the right of way. All
other trains will take a siding at least
half an hour before the special is due.
It Is not likely that the entire- Cabinet

TNTERCLTJB YACHT
ASSOCIATION" MEETS
Commodore Clay Outlines a Plan
Whereby Its Threatened Dis-
solution May Be Averted.
The first meeting of the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association since last season
was held at the Merchants' Exchange on
Wednesday night, the following delegates
being present: George E. Billings and J.
R. Savory of the San Francisco "iacht
Club. Allen M. Clay and R. R. l'Homme
dieu of the California Tacht Club and T.
F. Tracy of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
Since the California. Enclnal and South
Bay yacht clubs expressed their intention
of retiring from the association, only two
clubs, the San Francisco and Corinthian,
are left in it and as three clubs are neces
sary, the body must do something to save
itself.
Commodore A. M. Clay, the trustee cf
the Macdonough trophy fund, suggested a
plan whereby the association may con
tinue to exist and to hold annual regattas.
The secretary is to write to each of the
six yacht clubs on San Francisco Bay
stating that a club may send delegates to
the association without payment of any
fee or subscription, and that the expentts
of the annual regatta will be met, not by
an arbitrary and varying assessment, bat
by the payment on the part- -of each club
of an amount proportioned to the number
of yachts entered under its flag in che an
nual races. , There will be no fixed dues,
the current expenses and the costs of the
regatta being borne proportionately to the
number of entries. One plan suggested is
that each owner, managing owner or
charterer of a yacht should pay $2 to the
club from which the yacht is entered, and
each member of the crew $L This plan
will enable all the yacht clubs to remain
members of the association without ex
pense, and to send delegates to the meet
ings.
An alternative plan is to let the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association go out of ex
istence and to form an association of
yacht owners, active members to pay $2
per annum and associate members $1. As
sociate members will receive a ticket
apiece to the tug accompanying the rac
ing yachts, and need not be members of
any yacht club to be eligible. Under the
plan proposed, the greater part of the ex
pense would fall on the Corinthian Yacht
Club, which has the largest number of
members, enters the greatest number cf
yachts and wins most of the trophies. The
Corinthian Yacht Club, through its dele
gate, ex-Commodore *T. F. Tracv, ex
pressed its entire willingness to accept
this proposed distribution of the expenses.
At last year's regatta out of about forty
entries twenty-four, or three-fifths, were
from the Corinthian Yacht Club, and of
thirteen trophies awarded eleven went to
the Tiburon yacht owners.- ". -

Joseph M. Bonaclna," proprietor of the
Grand Southern Hotel at the corner of
Seventh and Mission streets, was arrested
yesterday afternoon on a charge of carry
ing and exhibiting in a threatening man

runs, resolved yesterday to resort to more
effective measures.' He -secured a fully
loaded revolver and, accompanied by his
daughter, sought the office of the Mutual

Rebskah Drill Corps.
The banquet hall of j the Odd Fellows'
building was crowded last night with
many members of the order,' including
representatives to the Grand Lodge and
delegates to the Rebekah assembly, to
witness an exhibition drjll by the San
Francisco Rebekah Drill Corps No. 2,
Captain Allie Parker. The drill was given
with that perf ectness which â¢ has marked
previous exhibitions and' was loudly ap
plauded. After the drill there was a ball,
which lasted, until midnight. :
The time' of the delegates to the Grand
Lodge of the Independent Order of Od3
Fellows was taken up yesterday in the
election of officers for the ensuing term,
the result being as follows:
William* Nicholls Jr. of Dutch Flat, grand
master; M. G. Gill of Red Bluff, deputy grand
master; C. W. Baker of Sacramento, grand
warden; George T. Shaw of San Francisco,
Brand secretary (re-elected); J. W. Harris of
San Francisco, grand treasurer (re-elected);
C. O. Burton of Kan Francisco. John Glasson
of Git.es -Valley and J. F. Nichols of San
Francisco, grand trustees; A. C. Bates of San
Jcse and John Morton of San Mateo, trustees
of the Odd Fellows' Home. y
Grand Master W. W. Watson was elect
ed as representative to the Sovereign
Grajid Lodge. There were seven candi
dates for the office of grand warden, and
there were three ballots before the suc
cessful candidate was elected. There was
a rave of fraternal justice that swayei
the vote In favor of the Sacramento can
didate. The late J..L. Robinette of Sac
ramento had been elected grand warden,
and when he was promoted deputy grand
master "WV W. Watson was chosen grand
warden. A few months after Mr. Robi
nette had been inducted into the office
which was to advance him to the posi
tion of grand master he was taken sick
and in a few months died. The death was
followed by the advancement of Mr. Wat
son, and at the following term the posi
tion, which should have gone to the rep
resentative from Sacramento, went, in the
natural course of events, to San Fran
cisco. "There were many in the Grand
Lodge who, believing that Sacramento
having been by death robbed of a grand
master, concluded that it was. but just
to that city to place in line for promo
tion another Sacramento Odd Fellow, who
two years hence will become the grand
master. On the third ballot those who
favored that Idea gained sufficient repre
sentatives to win out.
After the election the reports of a num
ber of committees, including that on reso
lutions to the memory of the late George
H. Morrison, P. G. P., and that on hon
ored dead, were adopted.
A proposition was made to continue the
committee on home location -for another
year and give it the following instruc
tions: . %
It shall within eight month* file its report
with the grand secretary, setting forth, so far
as can be ascertained, an estimate in detail
of the cost of any one or more home sites
recommended by them, including the cost of
lands, if any, the cost of necessary buildings
and improvements, furnishing and equipping
the same, and all other expenses incidental to
the establishing of a new. home, and said
committee shall also submit such recommenda
tions as' may seem " to them practical concern
ing ways and means for raising the necessary
moneys to defray such cost and expenses. Im
mediately upon receiving such report' the grand
secretary" shall cause copies of the same to be
printed and distributed among the subordinate
lodges, at the same time requesting the lodges
to carefully consider said report and transmit
to the grand secretary not less than ten days
before the Grand Lodge meets in 190? such
recommendations as the . subordinate lodges
shall adopt in the premises.
The advisability of taking action on the
recommendation of the committee that
the .White tract near Alum Rock be ac
cepted was the matter for discussion for
the rest of the afternoon, but no action
was taken in either case, and debate was
postponed until to-day.

the roll of commissioners was called and
the organization of the assembly effected.
Nominations for moderator were declared
in order, and Dr. Roberts of Danville.
Ky., placed the name of Rev. Dr. Purves
before the assembly. In making the nomi
nation Dr. Roberts spoke in the most
glowing terms of the qualifications and
capabilities of Dr. Purves. The nomina
tion was seconded by Rev. Dr. James E.
Moffatt of Cumberland. Md., and Rev.
Dr. Herrick Johnson of Chicago.
Plea Made for the West.
Rev. Dr. Minton was placed in nomina
tion by Rev. Dr. Hugh K. Walker of Los
Angeles, Cal., who paid a high tribute to
the character of his candidate.. He asked
for Dr. Minton's 'election, also on- the
grounds of justice and fair play, claiming
that the West was entitled to the honor
of- possessing tho moderator, as the high
office had in the history of the Presby
terian church been held . by only three
men west of the Mississippi.
President Janes D. Moffatt of Washing
ton and Jefferson College, /in seconding
Dr. Minton's nomination, said the time
had arrived when the general ' assembly
should be made a continental congress.
Rev. Dr. Edgar P. Hill- of Portland, Or.,
and Hon. F. T. Roots of Connecticut also
seconded Dr. Minton's nomination.
No other candidates were placed in the
field, and the roll being called, the vote
resulted as stated.
Dr. Minton was escorted to the pulpit by
Dr. Walker and Dr. Moffatt and made a
brief address to the assembly. He said:
Frisnds and Brethren: You will believe me
sincere when I say I thank you with all my
heart for this expression of your confidence. I
am sure I do not underestimate its dignity
and Importance nor your generosity and kind
ness. When I remember that you must have
passed by the beloved and distinguished brother
whose name was coupled with mine I must be
pardoned for expressing my genuine surprise at
my election. I thank you in the name of Cali
fornia, in the name of home missions. I am
bound to throw myself upon youY indulgence.
My faults will be many and obvious. . ln the
kingdom of Christ greatest are they who serve
and eerve well. I hope the spirit of brotherly
love will preside over all our deliberations.
Protests Against Peoria Plan.
A motion by Rev. Dr. NIcblls to non
concur in the "Peoria plan," which places
the appointment of standing committees
with the assembly instead of the mod
erator, and which was adopted by the St.
Louis general assembly, elicited a storm
of protest. As this is the first year of the
plan, the assembly decided to give It a
trial, and Dr. NIcolls' motion was laid on
the table.
By the "Peoria plan"' the church is di
vided into election districts, each of which
decides who of Its members shall be placed
on the several committees. The commis
sioners select their own chairman, leaving
the moderator without authority in the
matter. The committees will be selected
to-morrow and presented to the assembly
on Saturday.
At the suggestion of the committee on
arrangements the assembly decided to
meet daily at 2:30 p. m. and 8, p. m.

PHILADELPHIA, May 16.â The
Presbyterian General Assembly,
which began itsll3th meeting here
to-day, disposed of two important
matters during the afternoon ses
sion. Rev. Dr. Henry C. Minton of San
Anselmo, Cal.. was elected moderator,
Â«nd by an emphatic vote the assembly de
rided to accept the "Peoria plan" of
'choosing standing committees, though an
offort was made to obviate the system.
Rev. Dr. Minton's only opponent was
Rev. Dr. George T. Purves of New York,
and of the 613 votes cast Dr. Minton re
ceived S37 and Dr. Purves 267.
The opening session of the General As
sembly was called â¢ to order by Rev.
Charles A. Dickey, the retiring modera
tor, at 11 o'clock, in Calvary Presbyterian
Church, where all the business meetings
of the assembly will be held. Of the 650
commissioners there were few absentees,
end most of these â¢will doubtless arrive
not later than to-morrow, having been
unavoidably delayed. The entire nave of
the church was occupied by the commis
sioners and the galleries were crowded
with spectators, a large number of them
Â¦women.
Calvary chapel was given over to the
various local committees, who established
headquarters in the buildings in order to
he within access of the visiting delega
tions. The registration of commissioners
began at P:10 o'clock this morning, and
from that hour until convening time. Dr.
B. H. Roberts was kept busy receiving
credentials.
Reference to Sirs. McKinley.
The opening hymn. "I Love Thy Church,
Oh God." was sung by the vast assem
blage of delegates and spectators. Within
the char.cfl with Rev. Dr. Dickey were
Rev. J. AVilbur J. Chapman. New York;
Rev. Samuel J. Xicolls. St. Louis; Rev. Dr.
Herrlck Johnson. Chicago: Rev. Dr. Rob
erts, stated clerk; RÂ»-v. Dr. William B.
Noble, permanent clerk, and Rev. Dr. J.
Sparhawk Jonep. pastor of Calvary
Church. Rc'V. Dr. Nicolls offered prayer,
Ln which he made touching reference to
thp illness of Mrs. McKinley.
Then came the s'rmon of Rev. Dr.
Dickey, who spoke for two hours on "The
Coming of the Kingdom of Christ." At
the conclusion of hi* sermon Dr. Dickey
constituted th<Â» assembly, the commission
ers standing during the invocation.
Recess was taken until 3 o'clock, when
WRECK CUD
BY WASHOUT
Â¦ Fun and hilarity, added plentifully to a
programme of good tests, made the card
of sport offered by tho Knockers' Club to
the Union Park . patrons yesterday an
event which will hold its place in cours
ing history. The affair was a complete
success, the attendance large and betting
was brisk throughout. Thirteen times did
the decision favor the short-end dog,
though the odds were slight. No matter
how the dope read tnere seemed to be an
inclination on the part of the players to
let the dogs run a: even money and in
consequence the contestants were heavily
backed. Â¦ .
The advent of the chief knocker bring
ing his entry to the slipper's box was the
occasion of a noisy demonstration. In
this event Judge Grace left the saddle In
favor of Harry Edell. When the change
was made it was evident from the still
ness that had overcome the noisy crowd
that much anxiety was felt for the safety
of the new judge. His mount, an Oregon
pony bought for the German army, did
not take kindly to the change and began
to show his feelings. It looked bad for
the rider, but only for a moment. .A few
skillful moves told that Harry was a
horseman of ability, in fact a circus rider
of the time of the one- ring shows.
Judge Grace's dog had lost the- course,
score 5 to 2. No one could see where the
two points came In, but Edell has a
friendly feeling for the chief and allowed
his sympathy to carry him away.
Jim Grace from now on must look well
to his laurels, for in George McBwen Mal
colm, the Knockers' Club is possessed of
a wonder. In the early part of the stake
Malcolm did the slipping and did it well.
The praise bestowed by the fair sex was
justly earned. . >*'â¢> â¢ > Â¦

son, Black. Head, who i was held a slight

STAKE THE EVENT
Sacramento 6, San Francisco 2.
The local team emerged from .the tilt
wlih the Senators yesterday covered with
defeat and a coating of. ill-luck. Hank's
nine bunched hits often enough to have
done better, but the goddess would not
vm'.'e and the umpire would not sea things
as they happened.
In the first inning the Senators annexed
four runsâ more than sufficient to win the
game. McGucken, first up, said his pray
ers and went to the bench, but then the
fun began. I>evereaux cantered to first,
Courtney followed with a hit, McLaugh
lin, out of sheer envy, did the same thing
and Devereaux scored. > Hanlon went out.
Doyle then hit to Iburg-, who errored and
Courtney scored. Â¦ Stanley followed with
a slow hit to Iburg, who threw home In
time to catch McLaughlin at the plate,
but Donohue did. not see the play and
called Â»the . runner * safe. -â¢ Graham was
so confident of McLaughlln's 'plate death
that he walked away. Doyle kept on
running and crossed the rubber, making
run No. 2 that should not have been.
Then some warm words followed, all of
which were not very, complimentary to
Donohue. ', â¢ .-â¢:'â¢Â¦ r* " < i

ILLINOIS COURT DECIDES
BLACKLISTING IS ILLEGAL
It Is Held That Firms Have Right
to Take Protective Meas
ures. .
CHICAGO, May 15.â In the Superior
Court to-day Judge Baker decided that it
is legal for employers to maintain a
blacklist- The ruling was in the case of
Annie Condon against Libby, McNeil &
Libby, Armour & Co. and other stockyard
packing firms. The plaintiff . was a
labeler and can painter in the employ of
the Libby firm and in February, 1900, in
company with a" number of other young
women, went on strike because of â¢ re
peated reductions in wages. -Later the
women tried to obtain employment with
other firms, but their applications were
rejected on -account of their having been
strikers. Miss Condon began suit as a
test and the court ruled that the various
firms had a right to take protective meas
ures against persons who had' quit "the
employment of other firms without valid
reasons. This is the first time in a West
ern court that the so-called "blacklist,"'
by which an employe who leaves one firm
and is kept out of employment in his or
her trado by any other firms, has been
given legal standing by the courts.
PORTLAND MINE CLOSED
DOWN INDEFINITELY
Troubles Between the Company and
Miners' Unions the Cause of
Shut Down.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., May 16.â
The Portland mine, employing 700 men,
was closed down indefinitely at 3 o'clock
this afternoon,. owing to the. troubla be
tween the company and six miners' unions
of .the camp over the employment of non
union miners. A conference between rep
resentatives of the company and the
unions was held in this . city to-day but
failed to reach an agreement.
The Portland has been "open," making
no discrimination between workmen, but
paying the union scale. Lately the com
plaint has been made that union miners
were being displaced by non-union men
and that wages were being reduced in
some departments. A few days ago the
union officials demanded that the mine be
unionized. This was refused at the meet
ing here to-day.
Jt is not believed tho trouble will spread
to other mines in the Cripple Creek dis
trict.

Band of Armed Rangers Are Patrol
ling the Sweetwater.
Country.
ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo.. May 16.â A re
port has reached here from the Sweet
water country that a band of mounted
men is patrolling that section, but for what
purpose is not known. It is believed, how
ever, that the rangers are in the employ
of the fiockmasters, who have been
warned to keep off a certain range by the
cattlemen. About a week ago the sheep
men sent word to the cattle barons that
they would protect their flocks, and that
any attempt to drive off sheep or destroy
them, burn sheep wagons or Intimidate
herders would be resisted.
The rangers avoid towns and ranches,
and no one knows where they make their
headquarters. They are well armed,
mounted on fast horses and seem to be
prepared to fight at a moment's notice. .

NEW YORK, May 16.â The American
Congress, of Tuberculosis and the Medico-
Legal Society opened the second day of
their joint session with the reading of a
number of addresses on topics connected
with the general subject of tuberculosis.
During this afternoon's session Dr. M.
R. Leverson of Brooklyn read a paper in
which he denied that there were any in
fectious diseases; smallpox was not-con
tagious and certainly not tuberculosis. He
argued that thÂ© real cause of the spread
of disease was not infection, but fear, and
scored the doctors. This paper created a
disturbance, and Dr. C. K. Cole of Helena,
Mont., moved that the paper be not print
ed in the minutes of the congress. This
was carried.
Resolutions were adopted which say
that the duty of .the Government Is to
adopt such measures as may limit the
spread of tuberculosis; that measures
should tend toward the education of the
people through schools and the dissemina
tion of literature by the various health
boards; by affording: efficient and proper
care of poor patients, with the establish
ment of free sanitariums for such treat
ment; a regular sanitary inspection of all
public institutions, especially those of
charity and correction, and adequate in
spection of all meats, milk and other food
stuffs which may convey materials tend
ing to spread the disease, and control of
tuberculosis patients.
With this the sessions of the congress
Â¦were brought to a close. It was announced
that a free annex fo'r consumptives will be
opened next Thanksgiving Day at the
Montefiore Home for Incurables, this city.

Of the vast work of the postoffice and of. its im
portance to: the people the. Postmaster General gave
an interesting account. : The employes of the Post
office Department number more than double 'the en
tire army and navy of the country, and exceed one-
This commendation is to be noted not solely be
cause of credit due to Mr. Loud, but because it points
out once more to the people of California the~ impor
tance of keeping faithful Representatives in Congress
for long, perio'ds. Mr. Loud has been enabled to ren
der valuable service not only to his constituents but
to the whole country because his constituents have re
elected him term after term. Had the voters of the
Fifth District been as fickle as those of some other
districts the State would not have had the distinction
of having a Representative whose statesmanship has
achieved national reputation, and whose assistance in
administrative work is held in highest esteem by "the
heads of the great departments' of >the Government.
It is, to be hoped the lesson' will be learned through
out the State and that from- this time on- California
will keep experienced and faithful men at Washington
so tliat her influence in the Government will; be equal
to her rank as a commonwealth; â¢ â¢ .;.; - â¢ ' .
It is gratifying that in his speech' the Postmaster
General gave to our Representative the credit due
him. In referring to the 'services of Mr. Loud he
said: "I am prepared to say here what I have re
peatedly said, not in his presence, that no man in
Congress charged with a great work as he is charged
is more .thoroughly master of. the subject committed
to his hands, and more honestly and intrepidly de-Â«
voted to the duty which is assigned to him. I have
come through three years of experience to understand
the spirit which animates the chairman of that great \
committee, and I congratulate you and I congratulate
my countrymen that that important service, so vital
to the welfare of our country, so pervasive in its rela
tions, so broad in its relations, is in the hands of a
man -of the highest integrity and courage, who fear
lessly performs what he believes to be right, and who
intelligently guides it and Congress in the advance
ment of the postal service of the United States."
THE WORK OP THE POSTOPPICE.
AMONG the speeches that have been made at
the various exercises and functions attending
the reception to the President and Cabinet
none has been more instructive or more full of good
promise than that made by Postmaster General Smith
at the banquet given in his honor on Wednesday
evening. It is a speech that can be read with par
ticular satisfaction by Californians, because in all the
recent improvements and extensions of the postal
service one of the Representatives of the State, Mr.
Loud of the Fifth District, has been a prominent and
earnest worker.
The Germans are complaining that Von Bulow is
sacrificing the political interests of Germany to Great
Britain, while the British are swearing that Salisbury
has sacrificed Britain to Germany, and it is ; amid that
discord the two leaders are trying to set a tune for
the concert of Europe. S' "
Â»"T""* HE Waters and Forests Society of California
I does well to inform itself of the interest and
â¢*Â¦ co-operation in its purpose of the Secretary of
Agriculture.
The Secretary's memory goes back to the time
when men were saying in Iowa and adjoining States,
"The white pine is inexhaustible." The vast white
pine forests of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota
were trackless and virgin thirty years ago. Now, says
the Chicago Inter Ocean: "The end of the white pine
industry of the Northwest is almost at hand. The
years of its greatness are already passed.
"We doubt if history records another such shame
ful waste of natural Wealth as has been made in the
American forests. The greater part of these resources
is gone forever, but something can still be . saved.
The method which promises most permanent results
is the education of forest owners, to an appreciation
of their own real interests. When they once realize
that a forest, with proper management, can be made
as continuously productive as a wheat field they will
perhaps be moved to prudent action.
"Meanwhile Congress and the State Legislatures
should rigidly guard every foot of public forest, and,
in the interests of all the people, should resist every
encroachment of local selfishness."
In less than thirty years The Call may exactly copy
that and apply it to the disappearance of the sugar and
yellow pine and the Douglass spruce forests of this
coast. Fire and saw are reaping them untimely, and
prodigally destroying their .reproduction.
As a Western expression to the Secretary of Agri
culture and of the Interior The Call desires to say
that the present forest reserves should be protected
against grazing stock, and. cared for by a sufficient
number of trained foresters! Other forests should
be added to these reservations. -And as for the live
stock interest, it should be compelled to lease and pay
rent for the public land it uses on the plains, valleys
and non-forested mountains on the public domain,
and the rent so derived should be devoted to irriga
tion that crops may be raised and forests planted on
land now barren for want of water.
The waste of the Eastern forests has been criminally
prodigal, but it is small compared with the. waste on
the stock ranges of the public domain. The lumber
men had to buy forest land before they could jise its'
wealth. They had to pay something for the millions
they gained..; Not so the stock ranger. The people
support a high tariff en wool for the profit of sheep
growing as an American in.dus.try,-:and the. people
also permit the sheep man, for whose benefit they,
pay a tariff tax, to feed his sheep at their expense
on their property and never pay a cent for the
pasture!
Prodigality is not the proper name' for such a pol
icy,, and when it is fully understood the people will
say to the flockmaster. "Lease your range and pay for
what } r our sheep eat, or do without a wool. tariff."
Protection is all right, but becomes a burden when
flanked with a permanent free lunch. - - .

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
"ARE YOU A BUFFALO?"â N.- N.,
City. There Is not much mystery about
the question, "Are you a Buffalo?" It. Is
a josh fad. If a man meets- a friend and
asks him the question and the friend saya
that he Is not, the first speaker will offer
to initiate him for 11 cents and takes him.
into a barroom. If the victim has not got
11 cents, but puts up a large sum, the In
itiator pays for the drinks ;out of.tha
money handed him and pockets the rest.
The peculiarity of the buffalo degree la
that the grip is given with the left hand,
and if a buffalo when drinking uses the
right hand he "must put up the drinks for
the crowd." . . ,

KING EDWARD AS A MASONâ G. I*.
City. Â¦ King Edward VII is grand master
of the grand lodges of -England, Ireland,
Scotland and Wales, also grand prior of
the Knights Templar in England and
grand patron of the Ancient Accepted
Scottish Ritfe. He has been identified with
Masonry for more than thirty-two years.
None of 'those alternatives are acceptable to the
British, and as a consequence the negotiations are
seemingly deadlocked. -In the meantime the. issue is
becoming more and more critical. The colonials are
determined to break up the French fisheries if they
can, and will even run the risk of a war to" do so. One
of the most curious features of the controversyis. that
the fisheries are not only worthless to France but en
tail an annual drain upon her treasury, as the profits
derived. from the industry do. not equal the bounties
paid to sustain it. One authority says : "Less than
500 Frenchmen are employed on the whole' treaty,
shore, and their support is an annual charge on; the
French taxpayer." Thus it appears that "sovereignty
without soil may do to boast of, but it doesn't pay.'
It has been suggested that instead of a money pay-:
ment there be given something in the way of terri
torial indemnity. The Chronicle says that last Janu
ary "M. Decrais was credited with having formulated
several .alternatives to his colleagues for the aban
donment of the French fishing rights, on the New
foundland coast, which involved â -i. The cession to
France of the provinces of Darfur. and Bahr-el-GhazaU
on the west bank of the Nile, with an additional con
cession in the Polynesian group, for the abandonment
of the islands of St. Pierre-Miquelon, off Newfound
land. 2. The surrender to France of Gambia." 3. The
cession by England of the island of Dominica."
That means that while Great Britain owns the soil
of Newfoundland France Â¦: retains the sovereignty.
That shadowy sovereignty is so firmly rooted in the
pride of the French people that any Government con
senting to alienate it for any amount of money Great
Britain would be willing to pay 'or -could pay could
not- hold office for a day after the fact was made
known. .
.;We learn from the- London -Chronicle, that j when
Salisbury suggested an extinction of the French "rights
in- Newfoundland .the > French Minister of the" time,'
M. % ;Waddihgton, wrote to. him: -â¢ "France preserved
the exclusive right of fishing she always possessed.
The right of France* to the coast of Newfoundland
reserved to her fishermen is onlyapart of her ancient
sovereignty over the island,; which ishe retained in
cedingthe soilto England, ahd'which she has never
weakened or alienated."
Such being the situation the- French" haveVaskedr a
repeal of the bait act as a necessary preliminary to any
settlement of the controversy.- On their part the.Britf
ish have offered to buy out the -French rights, and
so "make . Newfoundland supreme, in control â¢ oCher
fisheries. It was when, the negotiations ..had reached
that point that the cqntroversy developed the meta
physical subtlety, of which ;we have spoken. '".V ; ' \ â¢
;' On : its ( face the ; question appears simple . enough.
By the .treaty of '.Utrecht m I>i3,'confi.rmed : by later
-treaties, 'the French-in- ceding, Newfoundland to Great
Britain retained for. French subjects the* right to 'catch
fish and dry Hhem.vbn : a- specified portion of New
foundland ; coast;: 700 smiles -long, and half a mile wide,
together- with" a ; right to build stages made of .boards
and the hutÂ« necessary :' for Â¦ frying fish; and to cut
wood in the' forest 1 for constructing- and repairing
those structures." -Air of those rights they, have con
tinued to enjoy, but of late years there has been a
good deal of "friction between .the. French fishermen
and the Newfoundlanders. The irritation has been
increased by the payment by the French Government
of. a bounty to their fishermen which gives them an
advantage over- the Newfoundlanders, who have no
bounty. For the purpose "of putting themselves oh
an equality with their competitors the natives enacted
a law forbidding the sale of bait to aliens." Their
claim is that, by obliging the .French: to bring 'their
own inferior jbait from France the natives obtain Ian.
advantage which just enables them to- survive the com
petition occasioned 'by; the French bounties. .'; ?> ' v*r- ' '
O.F all the political subtleties that ever perplexed
diplomatists of -this or- any- other ', age that
. ' which 4 now frets the brains- of British and
French statesmen in dealing with the question' of the
French fisheries Jn- Newfoundland is.perhaps the most
metaphysical and the most perplexing.i .Â¦Â¦<-/Â¦ â¢' '<Â¦ / 'V' V

were given of the substantial and spirit

Another time the editor advertises that
"a few chaste and pungent witticisms- are
wanted for the Attic Bower." It was wise
to specify that they should be chaste; for

decorated that department .will remember that

A few newspapers had "Departments of
Miscellany." In one -case such a depart
ment was called "The Bouquet." The
Boston" Gazette termed ; it "The Attic
BQwer." The ! editor was constantly in
viting, even urging contributions : ,
It was not until 1813 that the first daily
paper of Boston, the Advertiser, ap
peared; soon the old semi-weekly papers
languished and were absorbed by the Ad
vertiserâeven the Centinel. The Adver
tiser was a business paper. It gave no
notices of theaters or concerts, , no book
notices no foreign C or domestic corre
spondence. The Boston Courier, in 1824,
took up .all these lines and was widely
read? , - 'h Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦' \' ' \~ Â¦ - : -
There was probably never a time in
any country when- newspapers were so en
riched with political, contributions from
men of ability, standing and patriotism,
nor was there any time, when malignity
and scurrility were more rife.
The Boston Gazette had expired with
the century, the editor sending out his
farewell from prison. r" : *i -Â¦
: The- Columbian Centinel announced in
its opening Issues that, the editor "would
adorn the Centinel with the most delicious
sentimental sustenance which we can ob-'
taln,-as well the production of our soil as
exotick."- This department was first
printed under the heading "Sentimental
Repast"; then the editor evolved a ntÂ»re
elegant ! title, "The Helicon Reservoir" ;
then it'became "Sentimental Sustenance,"
then "Castalian Fount," then the "Cabi
net, of i Apollo.". A, department of. brief
anecdotes was headed "Entertainment for
the'- Disciples of. Zeno."- . The "Prepara
tions for Sunday" was changed to "Moral
Entertainer."

race track, gambling hell, all In one. It
was the most vivid excitement of our
grandfathers' lives; the first quarter of
the nineteenth century saw the fiercest
burning of the flre. There were objectors
to it all; serious, thoughtful men. who
saw, that under the guise of helpfulness
the monster was strangling the new na
tion; it seemed a giant task to kill such
an octopus, but when a few determined
men worked together the system went
down and" ceased to be with a suddenness
that was phenomenal. -
Some Odd Advertisements.
_ A varied line of advertisements appears.
One tavern announces that it will serve
pepper pot" en Mondays, turtle soup on
Saturdays, with blue point oysters. The
Quaintly. worded notice of the meeting of
the Tammany Society comes nextâ "On
the second going down of the sun In the
month of flowers, at the council fire of
the great , wigwam." Rewards for run
away apprenticesâ one "A Penny Re
ward, one but a. farthing, another six
pence, and for a runaway slave $100. This
latter reward is said to be thus excessive
because the slave has been so ungrateful.
The advertisements of books reflect his
tory "Notes on Virginia,"
Hamilton s "Last Letter" and "Amorous
Vindication;'â the latter priced! 50 centsâ
Paine s "Age of Reason."
: In the newspapers of 1802 we find eulo
gies on Martha Washington, who died on
May 22 of thac year. In the Washington
Federalist was the following:
! Died at Mount Vemon on the 22 ult. Mrs
Martha Washington, widow of the late illus
trious George Washington. "To those amiable
and Christian virtues which adorn the female
character, she added dignity of manners, su
periority of understanding, a mind intelligent
and elevated. The silence of respectful grief
is our best eulocy.
The news of her death had reached Bos
ton on_ June 2, and the Centlnel published
an account of her last moments. "Confi
dence and resignation were uniformly dis
played during seventeen days' depreda

Early; Glories of . Tammany.
The flrgt part of the century resounded (
with .the;, glories of SL â¢ Tammany, and!
newspapers of . Maryland, Pennsylvania
and New York contain frequent notices
of Tammany meetings and parades. The
name Is so associated to-day with New
York and New York politics that many
forget that he was not a New York
sachem, nor did his honors begin in New
York. He was first chosen as a patron by
the^ Pennsylvania troops under Washing
ton's command; soon his fame spread.
Forts were named for him, and the 1st of
May, chosen as his - birthday, was ' cele
brated as such a festival that in 1S10 Gen
eral Dearborn, Secretary of War, forbade
any further festivities, believing that they
fostered drunkenness and debauchery.
Tammany's popularity was not confined
to the army. Poets sanff his praises
plays were written on his life. In all
the Southern and Middle were
Tammany societies". The charter of the
New York society describes it simply as
a charitable association; it gave substan
tial aid to the needy; started a museum
of natural history; rescued the bones of
the prison-ship martyrs of the revolu
tion from ignominous exposure when they
chanced to-be thrown by -the waves on
the shore of/ Wallabout bay. The soci
ety gave those bones the most spectacu
lar and singular funeral ever seen In this
country. The popularity of Tammany
arose from its social attractiveness.
There were almost no clubs and assem
bly rooms, as our secret societies have
nowadays, and Tammany meetings af
forded a cheerful resort. The poet Hal
leck wrote:
There's a barrel of porter In Tammany hall
And the Bucktalls are swig-sing- it all the
night long-..
In the time of my childhood 'twas pleasant to
sit .
For a seat and seg^r 'mid the Jovial throng.
Bucktail was the name given because
on, their parades the members wore tur
key feathers and bucktails in their hats.
Tammany and the Common People.
One quality Was lacking In 'Tammany â
it* was never aristocratic. The' May day
parade '< with ; its 1 Indian mummery was
deemed vulgar; the jovial .meetings
could not be called choice. Many â¢Â¦ great
men Â¦ were members ; Aaron Burr was a
guiding spirit in its infancy, but the
general membership was not elegant.
Tammany was a recognized - counter
weight to the Society of the-Cincinnati,
which on account of its pride of member
ship and hereditary principle was looked
upon with alarm. The sweep of demo
cratic ideas is plainly shown by the fact'
tliat Tammany,' recruited from . among
the common folk, -has made': Presidents
and formed politics, while the Cincinnati
which included . Washington, Hamilton
and all the great men of the revolution
ary army, has never had enough political
influence to control a town election. ~:--

THE source of that personal influence which seems
to belpng to a man who is elected to the Presi^
dency is always the subject of interesting specu
lation. In President McKinley's case it seems to be
the feeling of every man that the .President Is his
neighbor. He does just what every man feels he
would do under the -same circumstances. He says
just what every man feels that he would say on the
same occasion. The 'old farmer who borrowed the
works of Plato from his pastor, read . and returned
them, saying, "I -like that writer; he's been getting,
hold of a lot of - things I always thought," expressed
the influence -of - -President Â¦ jMcKihley: -- When he
speaks of policies men say to themselves, ,Â¦ "I' always ,
thought that."'. What the' people have, thought he
utters, and they fellowship! him. . * ';" \'~ '.Â¦'/" V .
For. this reason personal attacks, on him have not"
been popular, 'even with his political opponents,: and
have drawn to- him more 1 support than; they have'
alienated. .During the present tour he has done just
what other wholesome men do. :.The'bpy straddle of, a
cross-arm on a telegraph pole; .yelling welcome as
loudly as a Comanche yelled 1 , defiance catches his at
tention as" he rides in the pomp of a procession, and
the boy gets a smile and! a salute. > A poor,: weak
woman, wheeled in her-chair to see him pass,"; forgets
her misery in the* gleam of cheerful sympathy that
goes with the President's respectful recognition of her.
presence. Every -other man looks .on_. and-, says, .
"That is just what I'd do,'-';but there are few who can
do it as gracefully and as graciously.
"This- President is cur neighbor," say all the peo
ple. That neighbor's wife is ill, and the. people,
keyed up to the tension of a week's expected
pageantry and pleasure, act neighborly. "They go
softly about their duties, and there is a hush upon
the city.- The feeling of disappointment is evap
oratedby genuine sympathy for our neighbor, the
President, and even the folk called cranks, who pre
sent themselves at the 'President's house with reme
dies, are no more than the representatives of those
country neighbors who: go to the sickroom offering
boneset and pennyroyal and the other herbs that are
vi the country domestic pharmacopoeia. It is all in
good feeling. -._.: .
The people at once recognize in the President's
abandonment of all the festivals '.and functions ar
ranged for him that he may comfort his invalid -wife
and minister to her" as , no. other can just what .the,
best man in the neighborhood would do, and so they .
feel only sympathy and respect for .this best "man in
this great neighborhood, .the United 'States. "For.
him and his their sympathy .is :v hearty and : genuine..
They have claims on-Wm,- but -"they quitclaim' to his
wife for the time and feelno regret that their prom
ised pleasure is deferred, because -all the sentiment >
they feel is regret for her suffering. and his anxiety.'
Sorry though we all are that the occasion : has arisen
for such a demonstration, yet we rejoice that it brings
out so bravely the gallant spirit of our people and
expresses the bond that is the peculiar tie between
them and the President. -. . j . . : . . \
The conduct of the students of our. two universities
is an expression of the same thing. Those young peo
ple were keyed up to the highest note of enthusiastic
expectation of meeting the President: In universities
in older countries such a disappointment is borne
impatiently. Not being able to meet the expected
guest they take -it out in jeering whoever fills the un
gracious place as his representative. Here it was not
so. The disappointment was left unexprtssed beyond
ah effusion of feeling when the cause of it was referred
to, and the great Secretary of State was accorded*
every honor that goes with respectful attention, ap
plause and high greeting, as he represented his chiefs
In all this the metropolis of California has borne
itself well. In self-restraint and universal respect "our
people certify their good stuff, just as much as did,
our friends in the South in the voice and heart' of
their greetings.- . . ' V 7

Reed Is Disappointed When Street
Committee Recommends Pas
sage of Substitute Bill.
Supervisor Reed appeared before the
Street Committee yesterday to urge
tcvcrable action on his ordinance provid
ing for the appointment of a Park and
boulevard Commission. Reed said there
â¢was dire need of more modern parks and
boulevards, and while the committee
agreed with him Supervisor Connor
contended that the work belonged more
properly to the Park Commission.
Dwyer thought the Street Committee
Â¦was competent to handle such matters
and Chairman Curtis believed that the
purpose of the measure would be accom
plished If the proposed improvements were
handled by the Park Commission and
Hoard of Works jointly., A substitute for
Reed'8 bill was recommended, providing^
that the two bodies named confer with
the Mayor for the purpose of reporting a
plan of new parks and boulevards. Reed
was disappointed at the committee's ac
tion and muttered something about
knocking his pet plan in the head, as he
left the committee room.

Mayor Phelan received a communication
yesterday from Supervisor Wilson anent
the complaint of Garfield Post. G. A. R.,
regarding the memorial day committee.
\V;lÂ«-on who is a Grand Army man, says
the complaint is not well founded, and the

were satisfied with the committee. Wilson
said, and it was the Intention to make the

LONDON, May 16.â In winding up the
debate on the army bill in the House of
Commons to-day, A. J. Balf our, the Gov
ernment leader, denied that . there was
any large body of opinion-. hostile to the
scheme of Brodrick, the Secretary ' of
State for War. - â¢ Â¦Â¦ - _- > Â¦
Balf our contended that it. would-be
impossible to get unanimity among
the soldiers on any scheme of
reform and said . that the. objections to
the Â¦ proposed scheme â¢ were fantastic and
groundless. The talks made â¢ upon the
scheme were from several sides and con
sistent with each other and it would be
a crime against the future to allow \ this
oppqrtunity to pass and the popular en
thusiasm to die out after the experience
of the last two years. " . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ , Â¦ â¢
The, amendment of Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman, the Liberal . leader, in
which he said the proposition larg-ely in
creased the existing burdens without
adding substantially Â¦" to the : military
strength of Great Britain, and asked for
figures and definite statements, was re
jected by a vote of 327 to 211. Brodrick's
scheme was then adopted by a vote of
305 to 163.
In the course of his speech Balfour made
the sensational statement that at one mo
ment toward" the end of 1899 there was in
Great Britain an appalling scarcity -of
small-arms ammunition, with no reserve
of artillery ammunition except what was
actually with the guns retained at home.
Balfour made the revelation in an attempt
to fasten on the Liberals negligence in the
matter of military supplies, pointing out
that the last Libera.1 Government weni
out- of office as a result of the Conserva
tives revealing the insufficient- supply of
small ammunition, which was then 92,000,
000 rounds, instead of 146,000,000, which the
officials regarded as the nominal reserve.
He declared that .the Conservative Gov
ernment had raised this reserve -to 170,
000,000 rounds before the- war broke out.
With reference. to tne dark period of the
war Balfour said: -..,-â¢.

VAL.LEJO. May 16.â With the
Hon. John D. Long, Secretary
of the Navy, and a host of Con
gressmen and other distin
guished iruests on board, the
famous United States steamer
McCulloch steamed into the
r.avy-yard waters at noon to-day. The
Fteam whistles of Mare Island and Val
lejo shrieked a welcome, the bells rang a
sonorous greeting and the populace was
cut in festal attire for the holiday. It
was the first time the flag of a Navy
Secretary had fluttered here since 1S9I,
when Herbert was a visitor, and the peo
ple thoroughly appreciated the honor.
The party started from San Francisco
at 9 o'clock this morning and had a most
enjoyable trip up the bay. Before the
McCulloch was turned toward Mare

front of the metropolis and out to the
Golden Gate. Those on board, besides the

At the navy yard a tremendous crowd
of Mare Islanders and residents of Val
lejo clapped their enthusiastic hands and
shouted their welcome to the chief of the
navy. On the dock was Admiral Miller
and his staff in fulldress uniform. The
Secretary was received with all the cere
mony to which his exalted position en
titles him and then the crowd had another
chance. Long has already endeared him
self to the people by his unostentatious
manner and the populace here was quick
to learn that he is a type of the plain,
admirable American. It was a gracious
welcome he received and he evidently en
joyed it.

FLOWERS that bloom in the spring,
and generally all the year round in
California, were placed on exhibi
tion In the northern end of the
nave of the ferry building yester
day by the enthusiastic floricultur
ists that comprise tho California State
Flcral Society. It was a bewildering mass
of bloom and color, radiant In effect and
redolent. Roses, carnations and ferns,
grasses and weeds from the deep blue
waters of the Pacific, and wild flowers
from mountainside and valley plain were
there In profusion.
Never in the history of the society has
there been a finer exhibition. During the
day light streams came freely in from
above. At night myriads of electric bulbs
cast refulgent rays over all. With these
accessories the beauty of the selected
flowers passes comprehension.
Off in the northern end is a collection of
wild flowers. Simple in their sturdy, yet
delicate colorings, they contrast strongly
with the carefully nurtured hot-house
reared contributions of society and profes
sional growers. Interest, from a botanical
sls-ndpoint, centered more largely in the
wild flowers.
An unavoidable delay in clearing the
hall made the work of preparing the
space a slow one. But the energies of the
committee in charge soon brought order.
The committee consists of F. A. Miller,
chairman, Mrs. J. R. Martin, Mrs. W. S.
Chandler, Mrs. John Knell, Mrs. T.
Sachau and E. Gill. They are assisted by
E. W. Maslen, Mrs. R~ S. Gunnison, Mrs.
Charles Friedman. Mrs. Kate Stewart and
Miss George Barker. When the opening
time arrived almost everything was in
readiness.
Display of Wild Flowers.
One of the prettiest displays of wild
flowers, embracing more than 200 var
ieties gathered within the last few days,
is that made by Mrs. Chandler. Mrs. E.
W. Maslen has a collection of popples
gathered in Alameda County of the single
and double varieties, and in many shades,
ranging from white to the most intense
golden. Mrs. Sachau, from her San
Iycandro gardens, has a display of 110
different varieties of roses. D. O. Mills
sent from his Milbrae conservatories a
rare collection of ferns and orchids, and
the professional growers, at the head of
which stood F. A. Miller of 215 Hayes
street, made displays in proportion to
their capabilities.
Judges were busy all day In examining
the exhibits as fast as they were placed.
Three classes of exhibitors were recog
nized, professional growers, amateurs
and dealers, and prizes were offered with
out number.
Special Prizes Offered.
In addition to medals of silver and
bronze, and certificates of merit, the fol
lowing special prizes were offered;
Mrs. V. K. Maddox sola medal for the best
white rose plant in bloom. ,
Colonel Andrews gold medal for the best col
lection of cut carnations; open to amateurs
only.
California Optical Company's silver medal
for the best cut blooms of American Beauty
roses; open to all.

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
Always as elusive as the little pea so
hard to pick from under the three innc
cÂ«nt appearing walnut shells in season
around circus time. The Fretter fooled
PCme of them again by finishing second
In the handicap at Oakland yesterday. It
occurred In the sixth act of. a drama
responsible for the downfall of two other
favorites. Hagrerdon, it was reported, pos
sessed a round trip ticket and, with his
lupgage checked through, nothing could
etop him. Don Cameron's big horse drop
ped in the betting from 6 to 4 and won
whistling for brakes in 1:40ft. The odds
on The Fretter backed from twos to 13 to
5, and he was left on second base. Lena,
the second choice, had a "Charley horse,'
lesing the show to Beau Ormonde. â¢
Thirteen bookmakers made weight and
were kept busy, at least several of them,
rounding things up. Two or three seemed
to be wise to the fact that certain horses
on this particular occasion would do well
and incst have grabbed something for
themselves. The attendance was large as
usual.
McAlbert took the opening sprint at six
furlongs in walking-fast time. Played
from 5 to 2 to 2, Hoar let the gelding slip
to the front, and with plenty in reserve
bf-at Letiger three lengths. Katie Wal
cott, at 25 to 1, ran third.
Ransch v on Princess Titanla put up a
most unintelligent ride in the Futurity
course run following, and Flatterer, the
favorite, won again. The last named colt
was cut off on the stretch turn, but later
on Btruck smooth Bailing, downing the
Princess more than a length. The show
fell to Oscar Tolle.
Seme weeks back EMvina ran second to
Flora Pomona In a stake decided at Tan
foran, and because of that was Installed
favorite for the five and a half furlong
scramble for two-year-olds. She finished
last. Rory Ough, piloted by Alexander,
came back with all his 6peed, winning
hands down from Jarretlerre d'Or. Lou
welsea received extensive support and got
all the worst of some rough riding, being
alrrost thrown to her knees by Jarretlerre
d'Or Just after getting out of one unpleas
ant predicament.
Conceded that he was meeting a much
cheaper lot of horses, Doublet turned a
very neat somersault In the six and a
half furlong concert, fourth to be decided.
Sent to the post favorite, Russell rode
him with excellent Judgment, winning
cleverly from Good Hope. Gibraltar was
bet on, but would not extend himself.
Ransch, astride the 7 to 1 shot, Katie
Gibbons, made a runaway race of the slx
turlong number following. Jim McCleevy,
a 12 to 1 shot, ran second a head before
Saul of Tarsus. The favorite, Dr. Nem
bula, acted badly at the post, running
back in the bunch.
The Fretter, a Favor

FUTURE PLANS
FOR NORTHERN
Union Pacific People Are
Taking Care of New
Purchase.
Outlook for a Harmonious
Agreement Between the
Different Interests.
Special Dlsj>atch to The Call.
XEW YORK, May 16.â Union Pacific In
terests, having bought control of the
Northern. Pacific as a means of protecting
their own property, are now considering
plans for taking care of their new pur
chase. Plenty of rumors were current in
Wall stret to-day as to the form these
plans would take. One of the- stories was
that the Union Pacific would take over
the Northern Pacific stock acquired by
the Harriman-Kuhn-Loeb party, Issuing
convertible bonds for it. This report was
discredited. The fact is that the interests
which have bought heavily into Northern
Pacific have tentatively discussed various
projects, but have arrived at nothing
The o'uUook for harmonious agreement
between this party and the JPÂ»: M Â°rS*Â£
Interests is admirable and it is highly
probable that both sides will consult amic
ably before â¢disposing of any impormnt
phase of the situation. The result is like
ly to be better conditions in the North
wester, from the standpoint of a holder
of railroad shares, than prevailed thera
before the Burlington deal was ever con
te rlmarkable la CT?e rumor which got Into
print to-day and was pronounced ridicul
ous in authoritative quarters was that the
recent sharp decline in Union Pacific com
mon shares was forced by the men In con
trol of that road In order to bring about
the low price at which Northern Pacific
antagonists could pick up bargains and
thuscement the bonds of reunion. Finan
ciers commented on this story to the er
fect that they had yet to hear of the real
owners of an Important property aiming
to cheapen It in order to let other mÂ«a ac
quire it. .
FITZ JOHN PORTER

General Is Eighty Years Old and
There Js No Hope of His
Recovery.
MORRISTOWN. N. J.. May 18.â General
Fits John Porter Is very ill. He has been
ill for the last three years with chronic
diabetes. Recently his disease has taken
a serious turn, and It la feared that ha
may die at almost any time. Dr. O. S.
Willis, his attending physician, doeÂ» not
hold out any hope for the recovery of his
patient, who Is nearly 80 years old.
General Porter's son and daujrhter-ln
law are now at his bedside, having been
called there from New York because of
his serious condition. Last summer Gen
eral Porter had an attaek similar to the
present one, but not so rferlous. General
Porter Is a conspicuous figure In the his
tory of the Civil War because of his dis
missal from the army, after a court mar
tial, and his reinstatement, after a court
of .inquiry.

members of the California State Floral
Society, under whose auspices it was con
ducted, are highly pleased with the re
sults.
A complete volume of the proceedings
of the congress will be published In a
short time and distributed upon subscrip
tion. It will contain valuable essays on
the subject of the flora of the State, pre
pared by the most eminent authorities.
The volume will be elaborate and the cost
of its preparation will be expensive. For
this reason It will be published by sub
scription and those desiring copies are re
quested to send their names to the sec
retary of the society, Mrs. Austin Sperry.
Dr. I>avld Starr Jordan, who was to
have read a paper on "How Plants
Think," was detailed at the university
and his failure to appear at the congress
was somewhat of a disappointment to the
audience. Several other papers that were
on the programme were not read.
Professor Charles H. Shlnn of the Uni
versity of California read a paper under
the topic of "Floral Literature of Cali
fornia." He advocated the publication of
an organ for the advancement of floricul
ture In the State. The remainder of yes

Prayer, Dr. William Kader; vocal solo, Mme.
Tojettl; question box, twenty minutes; "Pacific

FROM SEATTLE.
TO ARRIVE.
Peter Fay, ! one of the pioneer boatmen
on the water front, passed away at his
home on Vallejo street early yesterday
morning. More than forty years ago he
was boarding ships that came here from
the ends of the earth and ten years -ago
there was no better known. or more re
spected man on the front. About that
time he retired from business and the
water front only : knew - him as a visitor
thereafter. For years he did all the boat
ing for the Golden Gate Market .and his
headquarters were at the Vallejo street
wharf. Fay was almost the last, of the
old boatmen who were in. their prime
when Captain Dunleavy joined the police
force.
Passing of an Old Boatman.
To-night the local aeries will entertain
the officers and delegates at a banquet at
the Palace Hotel. This event, judging
from the preparations which have been
made by the committees, should prove the
most delightful affair in the history of the
present Grand Aerie.
Jerome Bassitt of San Francisco Aerie
No." 5 acted as . toastmaker/. . Short and
appropriate addresses were made by Oscar
Hocka, president of the local aerie; Grand
President Littlefield, Dr. J. B. Schwatka
of Baltimore, I Albert Ritchie of Omaha,
and several of the local Eagles." "After the
meal time was allowed for the visitors to
enjoy a plunge in. Sutro's baths. The re
turn drive was made " through Sutro
Heights and Golden Gate Park.. .
The fight which is being, waged by the
several cities for 'the honor of entertain
ing the next Grand Aerie is< at present
the absorbing topic of interest among the
delegates. Denver, Omaha, Atlantic City
and Dallas all have energetic delegations
working in their favor. Milwaukee en
tered the contest yesterday with a' flatter-
Ing offer and has a committee of citizens
working. to secure the prize.
Indications seem to point to the setec
tion of Dr. J. B. Schwatka for the posi
tion of grand worthy president. He has
a strong delegation campaigning in his
favor and there appears to be an under
lying opinion that he will secure the
honor. Dr. Schwatka's claims are being
opposed in a friendly manner by Attorney
Del Carey _Smlth of Spokane, Wash.;
Charles Flynn of Baker City, Or., and As
sistant Chief Palatier of the Kansas City
fire department. .
The" delegates returned so late from
their drive to the Cliff House that the
afternoon session was postponed until the
evening, when constitutional amendments
and resolutions were considered.
The grand" officers ] and delegates of the
Grand Aerie of Eagles, accompanied., by
their wives and 'daughters,' enjoyed a'de
llghtful drive yesterday to the Cliff House
and surrounding- points of Interest. ' It
was a merry crowd of Eagles that assem
bled at 10 o'clock in Pioneer Hall, the ap
pointed rendezvous, where. gayly ..deco^
rated carriages and tally-hos ' had been
provided." The 'party' was driven' first
through the Presidio and thence to the
Cliff House, where, on the veranda over :
hanging the ocean and in full sight of the
seals ; sporting in the water and on the
rocks below, the Eagles - enjoyed 1 ; their
luncheon. ; More than 200 sat down at the
table.: r : - - ; â¢â¢

The ship-owners, sailors and marine fire
men have come to terms and there will
be no strike on the water front for the
present at least. As the result of a con
ference the "grub money," over-time and
other questions at issue wens amicably
arrang-ed and the Pacific Coast Company
has signed an agreement that will be
binding for the next twelve months. All
the other steamship lines are expected to

the matter.

Jane Guillon arrived here from
Newcastle on the 1st inst. with 2937 tons
Â«.! coai. She docked at the Rosenfeld
1 linkers last Tuesday and began discharg
ing next day. The men working In the
mam hatch noticed that the coal was
heated, but the stevedore thought it could
nil bÂ« discharged without danger. Durinp:
i!ie night, however, the fire gathered
Headway and when the hatches were re
irioved yesterday morning in order that
tho coal handlers might resume work a
volume of smoke rolled out.
Salt water damages coal to a consider
able extent, bo Captain Roy ordered an
alarm of fire turned in. The fire brigade
jesponded as did also the State fire tug
Governor Markham. There was not suffl
< lent water in the Spring Valley mains
on the front to do any good, so tinallv in
order to save both vessel and cargo "the
order had to be given to flood the ship
with salt water. Four iines of hose were
quickly put aboard the Jane Gulllon from
the Governor Markham and after two
nours pumping the fire was supposed to
nave been drowned out and the ship's
pumps were ret to work pumping the
water back into the bay again.
It is not at all a sure thing that the fire
In the coal is out. A year ago when the
bhenandcah s cargo was on fire the vessel
was flooded, but two or three times there
after the blaze broke out again. When
nnally discharged it was found that the
null of the big four-master had been near
ly burned through.
The damage to the cargo of the Jane
Ouillon will fall on the underwriters.
Rosenfeld's Sons will not accept the coal
in its present condition and until some
understanding has been reached the work
or discharging the bark will not proceed.
The vessel Is not damaged and the only
loss will be from the cargo.
p'yr^HE carg-o of the French bark Jane

NEW YORK. May 16.â There was a still fur
ther lapse cf Interest in the stock market to
day, as shown by the decline in the volume of
dealings to below a million shares, for the first
time since the late boom attained force. The
market also gave evidence of further progress
toward normal conditions. There was still a
rather feverish price movement, but the oscil
lations showed a lessening tendency. These are
phenomena which invariably follow a* panic.
Usually the first violent relapses after the first
rebound do not carry prices back as low as the
panic lei-el, nor do the rebounds reach
as high as the panic high level. After
fluctuation has subsided there Is likely to be
a dull period and a gravitating tendency to a
level much lower unless some new factors of
strength develop to reawaken outside buying
tiemand. To-day the speculative contingent
were inclined to look for such a new Influence
to the promised settlement of the Northern Pa
cific dispute. No authentic information can be
had as to the terms of this agreement, but it
is generally accepted in Wall street that it will
insure the safeguarding of the interests which
deem themselves threatened by the Burlington
deal without retracting from the benefit of the
deal to Its original projectors. The rapid prog
gress reported to be making in the deposit of
Burlington stock to be exchanged for the pro
posed new bonds seems to insure the rapid con
summation of the. Burlington deal. The effect
of this development was manifest In St. Paul
and Northern Pacific. Northern Pacific, owing
to the abnormal standing of that stock in the
market, was not an index to the situation. The
process of exchange going on in the Burlington
f-tock affected it to some extent in the same
way. The advancing tendency in Union Pacific
was constantly checked, supposedly by the sur
mises as to the method of financing the pur
chases of Northern Pacific stock made in the
company's interest. The advance in St. Paul
over last night's level reached 7%, In Great
Northern preferred 6%, Northwestern 6 and
Rock Island 4%. Another active center of spec
ulation was Amalgamated Copper, in which the
buying was large, apparently by inside inter
ests, and regarding which various favorable
items of news were published during the day.
The most important was the reported intention
of the Vice Chancellor of New Jersey to dis-
EOlve the injunction against the absorption of
the Butte and Boston and the Boston and Mon
tana companies.
The 6tock advanced at one time 7%. There
were various other points of epecial strength,
the causes of which were not always disclosed.
Thus International Power . ad vanced 10%, Min
neapolis and St. Louis 7%, on expectations of a
dividend increase; American Express 9%, Con
solidated Gas 5%, Lake Erie and Western 5%,
Iowa Central preferred 5 and Pullman 4%. The
relaxation of forced liquidation made compara
tively light buying orders effective in advancing
prices. There was undoubtedly a good deal of
manipulation by insiders in the interest of bet
ter prices, but there was also a growth In in
vestment demand for good dividend payers. But
not less Etriking than the strength with which
prices advanced was the ease with which prices
were forced down again under light selling with
which the day closed, with prices all the way
from one to five points below the best and with
net changes a good deal mixed and for the most
rÂ«irt em&lL Keports of needed rains in the
Southwest were an early encouraging feature
end the growth of labor troubles caused some
uneasiness, especially the candid admission by
the leading publication in the interest of the
Iron trade that there may be widespread labor
disturbances in that trade after July L The
ease In the money market was due entirely to
the falling off in demand and speculation and
other causes are tending to a steady depletion
of New York bank reserves.

CHICAGO, - May 16.â Rains of more or less
plentlfulness over the State of Kansas, to
gether with a good drenching administered to
the young crops of Oklahoma and Texas, was
taken in the wheat pit as Justifying- a lower
level of prices and July at the opening- was
offered liberally %@-&c to %@%c lower at
71%@71%c. At 71c some buying orders' were
reported and as cable3 were steady. Northwest
receipts .moderate and there was an unex
pectedly stiff demand fÂ«-r May July rallied to
71%c during the first hour. The demand for
May,' which raised that delivery to %c prem
ium over July at one time, was reported to
be due to the necessities of New York shorts
and not to export sales, as had been thought
at first. This explanation caused a slight re
action and the remainder of the day the mar
ket ruled dull and at times entirely neglected.
The close was rather easy, July %c lower at
71%@71 l 4c. May closed with %@%c of its prem
ium still held.
In corn the expected squeeze in May did not
materialize. On the contrary the bull leader
was credited with liberal sales of that option
as well as of July. May opened unchanged at
68c and under selling by Phillips dropped to
55c. A rally of l%c followed and then it de
clined to 53%c. The close was 3%c lower at
54%c. July closed %@%c down at 44%@44%c.
Lack of bull support, the wheat easiness and
reports of freer country offerings Were the
factors.
Oats opened steady, but weakened later on
the rains and heavy selling by Phillips and
the bull party. Trade at first was weak, but
became quiet later. July closed %@%c lower
at 2&%c. May closed %<;â¢ down at 30c.
Provisions were qulu. and steady on light
hop receipts. July pork closed 12%c \ higher,
lard 5@7%c up and ribH unchanged.

OAKLAND. May 1Câ Four sisters of the
Sacred Heart Convent had a narrow es
cape from serious injury In a runaway
accident which happened this morning
while they were being driven In a cjrrriago
to the parochial scnool of the Church cf
the Immaculate Conception. On Eighth
street the coachman lost control of the
horses attached to the carriage and the
frightened animals dashed up the street
to the corner of Eighth and Brush, where
they collided with a truck. The carriage
was overturned and its occupants thrown
violently to the ground. Although the
rig- was wrecked the sisters escaped bodily
injury.
The accident was caused by a bridle
breaking just as the horses started to
run, thus rendering- the coachman power
less to check them.

Its originator is Fritz Boehmer,
a pioneer citizen, who has just celebrated
his seventieth birthday. He circulated a
petition and soon got forty-nine other old
men to sign it, the limit of membership
being. fifty. The minimum age limit is
70 years, but men over 100 are eligible to
join. None of the men Mr. Boehmer has
on his petition are less than SO years of
age. According to his computations their
combined ages make them more than 4000

"We are prevented from raising prices
cn our because of Eastern com
petition," explained Mr. Booth. "There
wages are on the average 50 cents a day
less- than ours. While the wages. are cor
respondingly increased, the Eastern man
ufacturers are better able to meet the
raiso thnn are we who are compelled to
operate on a very narrow margin of
profit. . .
"Many of our men have been with us for
1 years and appreciate our position. We
have had a number of large contracts on
hand and to complete them the men have
been working overtime that we might not
be embarrassed- when the strike is called.
The -work is pretty well cleaned up now
.and if the works are closed down on
Monday without loss to us on our con
tracts the thanks will be due entirely to
tho men. On Monnday we shall open the
works as usual, and if the men do not
choose to work we shall be compelled to
close down. There will be no lockout." I
do not anticipate any trouble. There have
always been the kindliest feelings between
myself and the men and I am as anxious
as they to sp-j a settlement that- will bft
satisfactory to all concerned." .
President Charles S. Booth of the Oak
land Iron Works, employing 180 hands,
said to-day that he could not agree to the

The family had some money on deposit
in a savings bank; but Mrs. Fritz could
not sret hold of the coin. Fritz came to
town from Siskiyou County a few days
ago, according to his wife, to draw, that
meney and depart again. His caso will
be heard to-morrow in the police court.
The Fritzes, husband and wife, appear
to have very different ideas concerning
the responsibility of a parent to care
lor his offspring. The complaining wife
Insists that she has been compelled to
take in washing to keep the wolf from the
door, while Mr. Fritz in his capacity as
butler in a wealthy family has gained
some peculiar ideas about the place his
family should occupy.
Mrs. Fritz told Prosecuting Attorney
Leach that last March her husband noti
fied her that he would no longer support,
his children. He was in close touch with
the upper crust and he had discovered
that his family's station in life was not In
harmony with his new field. He .demanded
that Mrs. Fritz should start' the children
toward a higher sphere, but Mrs. Fritr.
rejoined that she could not move in that
direction upon their limited resources.
'â¢I admit that my husband does mingle
as a servant in the upper ten's circle,"
saifi Mrs. Fritz, "but that ought not to
excuse him from falling to care for. his
children."
Fritz was arrested at Sixth and Clay
streets by Policeman Woods. The hus
band did not seern to be much inconveni
enced by the affair, for he speedily pro
duced $40 in gold as bail and displayed a
gold watch and more coin at the police
station.
Emil Fritz refuses to support his wife
and children because his spouse cannot
reach the stratum of high social position
in which he has been moving for several
months. At least that is the story which
Mrs. Fritz related when she secured a
warrant for her husband's arrest for ne
glect to provide* for his daughters, aged
6 and 12 years respectively.

back to Fitchburg to secure more evidence
to support his charges. .
Struckman said that-he had employed
Walford for seven months. The two men
cared for the_ cattle night, and morning,
while during" the day Struckman went
over the route delivering milk to his cus
tomers, leaving his assistant at home to
do the work about the place.
"All this time," said Siruckman, "he has
been abusing my confidence by making
love to my wife, e If I succeed in catching
him, something is going to happen."
When Strucnman reached home last
night, tired with his day's labor and ex
pectant of a warm and savory meal, he
arrived upon a scene of desolation. The
house was dark and cold. Outside the
cows were lowing hungrily. The cottage
was despoiled of its furniture excepting a
bed, two chairs and a table, too dilapi
dated to be salable.

WYKES SAYS THE SCALES
E1TBICHED HIS EMPLOYERS
Claims C. E. Whitney. & Co. Owe
Him for Operating Scheme to
Defraud Consignors.
"William T. Wykcs' 'defense to the charge
; of embezzlement preferred against him by
; the firm of C. ' E. . Whitney & Co. is that
; instead of owing the firm $329, which they
allege he embezzled, he claims they owe
him $1600. He avers' the greater portion
of this sum wa3 earned by' him under the
terms of an agreement with the firm by
which be was to defraud consignors by
' deducting 1 from the actual weight of con-
signments of hogs,, etc. -Ten per cent of
the profits . derived from the operation of
; t'lis scheme, Wykes claims, was to be his.
Wykes made these assertions in his own
i defense be'Jore Judge Dunne yesterday.
. When consignments of hogs were re-
ceived, he said, he operated a lift on his
i scales and every time- they tipped the firm
was the winner by 400 or 500 pounds.
Though counsel for the prosecution ob-
jected to this line of testimony Wykes re-
tused to discontinue until after he had
stated that the firm was not only aware
of the-frnud which was^eing practiced,
but wus "kicking" because the daily "11ft-
iriR" was not greater.
The balance of .the $1600 due him. Wykea
says, wus In the nature of commissions on
the monthiy oale of hams. Wykes will be
cross-examined to-day and it is expected
that ilie case will reach the jury to-mor-
row afternoon. â¢

Mrs. P. H. McCarthy, wife of the pres
ident of the Building- Trades Council and
Civil Service Commission, died suddenly
last night. Mrs. McCarthy called at the
home of friends living in the Mission
Wednesday afternoon, and while there
became suddenly III. She gradually grew
worse and the physicians who were sum
moned to attend her would not allow her
to be removed to her home. She. sank
into a . stupor yesterday afternoon and
died a few hours later. Arrangements
for the funeral have not yet been made.
The class known as the business course
in the Hamilton Evening School was abol
ished from the beginning of the fall term
on account of the light attendance.
Leaves of absence were gTanted to MlsCs
M. Reddy, William T. Plunkett, Miss J. S.
Klink and Mrs. M. Witts.
The two classes of the Richmond Even
ing School were consolidated into one and
the services of the substitute, Mrs. Sykes,
dispensed with.
Director Denman produced figures to
show that the attendance in schools is
not congested. ""From, reports of princi
pals, Denman-declared that no single class
contained more than fifty pupils and many
classes fell below forty in enrollment. The
grand average attendance. Denman said,
is thirty-nine and the average number be
longring- forty-two..
The Board of Public Works made an un
successful attempt yesterday to Induce the
Board of Education to pay for an addi
tional employe In the repair department
out of the school funds. A communica
tion from the first named body was read
at the School Board's meeting, in which
it was stated that it was impossible to
make urgent repairs to school buildings
for which requisition was made because
the Superintendent of Public Buildings
had no messenger at his disposal, and for
the added reason that there is no tele
phone in the repair department.
Superintendent Webster remarked that
P. M. Wellin received $125 per month from
the school fund for inspecting school re
pairs, and as he had a conveyance at his
disposal Webster thought there was no
actual necessity either for a telephone or
for a messenger. Webster objected to
the Board of Works paying the salary
of another employe out of the school
funds, and the matter was referred to Di
rector Casserly.

In the matter of the three appeals of
the case of the Oregon and California
Railroad Company vs. the United States
the Judgment of the lower court was con
firmed. In the case of James A. Murray
and the Grand Opera-house Company vs.
John O. Bender judgment was affirmed.
Klmllar action was taken in the case of
George Johnston vs. George E. Woodbury.
It will be impossible for the United
States to gain access to its property v.ith
out trespassing upon the surrounding pri
vate property, and it is believed that con
demnation proceedings for the whole of
the fourteen-acre tract will be instituted
shortly.
The Court of Appeals decided yesterday
that the original Mission Rocks consisted
of a rock fourteen one-hundredths of an
acre In area and a smaller rock one one
hundiedth of an acre In area. The pre
decessor of the California Drydock Com
pany obtained from the State of Califor
nia a grant of the rocks and their imme
diate surroundings as tide and overflowed
lands and the drydock c/apany filled in
the tide lands surrounding and built ware
houses thereon, so that the area, includ
ing thÂ» original rocks, Â¦was increased to
a little more than fourteen acres and a
hall The decision holds that the State
of California never had title to the rocks
that were never overflowed, and therefore
could not grant a valid title to a third
party, but that the overflowed and tide
lands filled in by the drydock company
are the property of that company. This
leaves the Government only a little more
than one-cixth of an acre in the center of
the tract.
The original suit was filed by United
States District Attorney Coombs. He
asked for the restitution of the property,
consisting of fourteen acres and sixty
nine one-hundredths of an acre, and for
Â£55,000 for damages, rents and profits. In
the United States Circuit Court Judge
Beatty gave a judgment for the posses
sion of the property, but without dam
ages.
A decision handed down yesterday by
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals reverses the Judgment rendered sev

Tax -Collector Scott filed suit yesterday
to compel the Board of Supervisors to al

work of compiling the military list. Scott
avers that on the list he has prepared
there are 46,199 names and that under
the. 'law he Is entitled to $5 for each 100
names on the list. The object of this list
is to determine the number of men with
in the city and county capable of per
forming military 1 service.
Scott Wants to Be Paid.
In the meantime the court will endeavor
to ascertain whether under any law, com
mon or uncommon, a marriage by proxy,
where the minister officiating concludes
the ceremony by stealing the bride, is
legal. .
- After the court had made its order pro
viding for the temporary custody of the
little girl, the mother, giving the name of
Jennie R. Scheller, instituted suit for di
vorce. She alleges failure to provide as
cause of action.
As White was leaving the court room
with the little girl she began to cry for
Scheller, whom she called her father.
Scheller was then placed on the stand and
after establishing the fact that he ia a
hard-working man and has a respectable
home at 507 Twentieth street and was
anxious and able to properly care for the
child, Judge Graham ordered that the
little miss be placed in his custody until
the final determination of the case.
Child Cries for Scheller.
â¢ "Fishburn" also declared he was indus
trious and said he - and Mrs. Scheller
should be allowed to keep the child. He
said he was a photographer, a dress
maker, a machinist, a doctor, a soldier, a
clerk and a lawyer. Judge Coffey said
1 that he believed he was â¢ industrious and
his â¢ story proved that he was truthful,
and hence the court could only hold one
thing against him, and that was that he
% was a lawyer and probably practiced pro
bate law. . "Fishburn" failed to feel the
thrust, but kept on explaining until
stopped by the court.
. Judge Coffey announced that as the cus
tody of the child had been granted to her
mother In the divorce proceedings, which
were decided several years ago in De
partment 7 of the: Superior Court, he had
no Jurisdiction over the case and would
suggest that it be taken before Judge
Graham for further hearing. The child,
"Fishburn," Mrs. Scheller and Mr. Schel
ler, who had been summoned to court to
testify In the case, went .before Judge
Graham, but as there was a case on trial
In his department the hearing of Secre
tary White's application was continued.
After trying for a time to avoid the
questions of Judge Coffey, "Fishburn*'
finally acknowledged that he was not
present in person when "he married" the
woman with whom he is living and whom
he claims to be his wife, but says that
he was married by proxy, the woman in
question and the minister who performed
the ceremony being then in Elizabeth, Pa.
"Fishburn" said: "I was in this city.
And," he continued, "when the minister,
who was none other than Phillip M. Fish
burn, saw how pretty she was he took
her himself. That, was in 1891. Â±sut I was
married to her by proxy and hence I am
her husband, and I know I am the father
of the child." .
Alleged Long-Distance Marriage.
Secretary "White of the society, who as
serts that "Fishburn" is one John Bothas,
also known as Joe Smith, a native of Ger
many, applied several days ago for letters
of guardianship upon the little girl In
question and, the matter was called for
hearing before Judge Coffey. The evi
dence developed the fact that the child's
mother,. Racha.el J. Flshburn-Scbeller,
wife of Edward Scheller, married Phillip
M. Fishburn, father of the child, in 1887;
that subsequently she procured a divorce
from- him and married Scheller; that she
deserted Scheller some time ago, and is
now living with James "Fishburn," who
claims to be the father of the child.
Photographs of Phillip M. Fishburn
were presented to the court to prove that
James "Fishburn" was not the first hus
band of the woman with whom he Is liv
ing.. The photographs show Fishburn
to be a large man, with mobile features,
while' "Fishburn,"; the pretender, is a
small man, undeveloped and not muscular,
and high cheek bones are the most promi
nent part of his features.
This strange statement was made by
James "Fishburn," as â¢ hÂ© calls himself,
before Judge Coffey yesterday. "Flsii
burn 1 ' appeared before that Judge and
later before Judge Dunne with the object
of preventing nine-year-old Jenta. Fish

control of ths California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children-

In his official â¢ capacity Mr. Cortelyou I
must riot only direct the vast mass of
White House correspondence and super
vlso the arrangement for state dinners
and other social functions, but he must
receive callers, interview, them as to the
nature of â¢ their business and . make ap
pointments for them to meet the Presi
dent.- It is in the discharge of the latter
service that Mr. ' Cortelyou has proven >
himself an ideal secretary; for the Presi
dent of the United. States must of neces
sity deny himself occasionally to callers,
even of great, eminence and distinction,
and it is obvious that the secretary must
be a man of rare tact and diplomacy in
order not to give "offense to* such people.
;. Mr. Cortelyou 'is alw*ays pleasant-faced,
pleasant-mannered and- pleasant-spoken,
to all callers. He is a man of most suave
arid courtly, address and is extremely pop- '
ular with public men at the National Cap- '
ital.' He is an especial favorite , with the
newspaper correspondents of Washington
city, with whom he comes into daily conâ
tact and the press men -who have accom
panied the Presidential train to California'
unite in declaring him to be a most agree- j
ablo and accommodating gentleman.:- '
The people of {San "Francisco and of
California will that
the present' sad -situation prevents an ex
tension of further hospitality to the Presi
dent's private secretary 'and Mrs." Cortel

visit this coast again under happier cir
