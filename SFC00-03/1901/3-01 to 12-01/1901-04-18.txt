Steel Company, and subsequently, as he
sees fit, all the men of the new Morgan
Company. This- is accounted for by the
absence of Vice Presidents John F. Ward
of ICiles, Ohio, and John Chappell of New
castle, Pa. The meeting adjourned until
to morrow morning, when these officials
will be present.
Much of the session to-day was taken
up in a conference with John Janett,
head of the bureau of the Sheet Steel
Company. Jarrett contended that the men
had violated their agreement of a year
ago. In which they agreed to remain at
â¢work under the conditions then existing,
the violation being in their joining issues
with the association. The Amalgamated
men were firm' in asserting that their
joining the association was not a viola
tion of the agreement. The original agree
ment will probably arrive to-morrow from
New York ar.d will be further discussed
by, the board and Jarrett.
The nature of this agreement consumed
in argument much of the time of the ses
sions, and on It hinges largely a remote
possibility of settlement without further
concession by* the sheet company or a
testing of strength of the new combina
tion of capital and President' Shaffer's as
sociation of the combined skilled men.
John Jarrett also asserted in the meeting
and out of it that the company had made
absolutely no effort to displace the men
on strike at McKeesport. While the com
pany Is anxious to run the mill, it is now
seriously working on the line of concilia
tion. He said:
talked to the advisory board for an hour,
advising conciliation and arbitration.
Later, it Is understood, Shaffer heard
from Colonel French at his home In re
lation to some action he had taken. When
the Amalgamated president was asked to
tell the nature of Colonel French's mes
sage he declared he had nothing to say
nor would he deny that he had received
such a message.

FITTSBURG, April 17.â The threatened
strike' of all the Amalgamated As
sociation employes in the organized
mills of the American Sheet Steel Com
pany and subsequently of all the organ
ized men of the association in the mills
of the United States Steel Corporation
trembles in the balance to-night. On the
one hand President T. J. Shaffer Is
backed up in his determination to call a
general strike by a majority of the mem
bers of the advisory board and the dis
trict presidents and trustees, who were in
cession all'tiay. On the other hand there
is a new movement toward conciliation
and arbitration, which may end the en
tire controversy in Pittsburg to-morrow
or may be carried to New York to be ad
justed by higher powers.
President T. J. Shaffer said to-night
that the outlook for settlement is, better
than at any time since the McKeesport
trouble started. He refused to explain this
statement.
Colonel G. Watson French, vice presi
dent of the Republic Iron and Steel Com

â¢ When seen to-night in Sausalito Wilson,
Â¦who was In custody, said: I -was out

shots, but did not shoot at any one.".
When more closely questioned he. said
that he did hot remember exactly what
he did last night; th<tt he had been drink
ing heavily for some time past. In refer
ence to his trouble with McCue he said:
"I have been terribly persecuted by that
man. I bought my home and ever since
have had trouble with McCue over the
road I should travel to reach it. I did
not wish. to kill McCueâ it would be a

"About 6 o'clock last nighty I went out
into the .yard," said Mrs. Scouler tCT-day:
"returning in a moment, I'.stepped 'upon
the porch and started to open the kitchen
door, when a shot was fired from the knoil
back of the house. The bullet tore
through the. house and I heard the plas
tering and broken glass falling: and 1
rushed inside. Other, shots were nred, but
ip the excitement I did not count them.
"Mr. Scouler and I took the children and

any one should harm us, and Mr. Wilson

shattered wood; The curiosity was to-day
viewed by a large number of people.
The trouble between Wilson and McCue
rs of long standing and has many times
been ventilated in the courts. Some years
ago Wilson, who is a^ well-known archi
tect, with offices on Sansome street, San
Francisco, bought '.a tract of land from
McCue and built a home thereon.- In
course of time tie and McCue got into a
dispute over the right of way. to be used
by Wilson in reaching his home, i McCue
barred the upper road with a fence arid
insisted that Wilson use the lower road.
This -Wilson refused to do, and as often
as McCue would erect the fence Wilson
would tear i^ down, and each time McCue
would have him 'arrested for malicious
mischief. The last arrest was made on
complaint of . McCue about a wek ago.
Judge Bellrude of Sausalltoi who issued
the .warrant, allowed Wilson to go on his
own . recognizance until â¢ to-day, . -when i he
.was taken into custody and "his bonds
fixed at $500. Both McCue and "Benjamin

be prosecuted, as the shooting was a de

The theory of the officers Is that "Wil
son, who has been drinking heavily r went
home last night in an ugly mood, and,
after, brooding over his trouble "with his
neighbor, decided to murder the entire
McCue family. With this object in view
he took his rifle and made his way to the
knoll back of the McCue home. Here, it
Is believed, he lost his bearings in the
gum tree grove and fired Into Scouler's
house instead of McCue's. After the
shooting he went home and then returned,
walking up the road in front of the
Scouler home. He was here met by sev
eral excited residents.' who asked him if
had heard the shooting:. To this he re
plied: "Yes, 1 guess it was Jim McCue."
and then continued on his way.

Four people were in the house at the

doubtedly due to the kindly interference
of Providence. Wilson Is in Jail to-night

upon the Scoulers was known to exist,
and it was not until this afternoon that

will be introduced, which will- n.ot only

with some proba-bility of truth, that the
Crocker-Huffman Company, which built

to show that such is. the case. It is but

that Impotency, Pramaturenesa. etc.. are not

Any sufferer from nasal catarrh., throat
or bronchial trouble, catarrh of the stom-
ach, liver or bladder, will find Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets remarkably, effective,
pleasant and convenient, and your drug-
gist will tell you they are absolutely free
from any injurious drug.
It has been known for some years that
the radical cure of catarrh- could never
come from local applications, but from an
internal- remedy, acting on the blood and
expelling the^ catarrhal poison from the
system.
A large and constantly Increasing ma-
jority of the American people arecatarrh
sufferers. This is not entirely the result
of our changeable climate, but because
modern Investigation has clearly proven
that many diseases, known by other
names, are really catarrh. Formerly the
name catarrh was applied almost exclu-
sively to the common nasal catarrh, but
the throat, stomach, liver, bladder, kid-
neys and Intestines are .subject to ca-
tarrhal diseases as well as the nasal pas-
ea Res.
In fact, -wherever there Is mucous mem-
brane there is a feeding- ground for ca-
tarrh. â¢ â¢ . .
The usual remedies, inhalers, sprays,
douches or powders, have been practically
failures, as far as anything more than
temporary relief was concerned, because
they simply dry up the .mucous, secretions,
without hevins tfcÂ» remotest effect upon
the blood and liver, which are the real
sources of catarrhal diseases.

PALLIUM WAS CONFERRED.
lea: Be you. In the truest and beat meaning
of the word Americans; Wvlng America, loving
its institutions, devoted to its Interests, chary
in blaming it, ardent in defending it. There
Is among some of 'us, I am not afraid to say,
a disposition to criticise at every moment, j to
rejoice In criticising-, to exaggerate faults, to
minimize virtues,, to pile up grievances, to
grumble perpetually. Such a disposition is un
patriotic and does most serious harm to the
Catholic faith In the eyes of intelligent ' and
earnest Americans. Let it disappear for good.
Surely the time has come to. leave off the old
spirit which days of real persecution in olden
times did beget, to live of the present and the
future and to reach courageously but hon
orably forward toward the elevation of our
people to the character as well as to the con
dition of free men. Let us be just to America
and know and proclaim that nowhere, all
things duly considered, Is the church freer
than in America; that nowhere, as in America,
is she allowed to live In untrammeled freedom
and to prosper as- her iorces and the zeal' of
her sons permit.
From yonder pallium has coma my Inspira
tion. ' In words that burn, with the deepest
feeling- and most earnest ' action, the pallium
that touches the shoulders of John Joseph
Keane speaks to me, &s it does to my hearers,
of church and of country, of sacred love for
one and the other, of Intelligent devotion to
the weal of one and o* the other.'
Visiting Clergrymen Banqueted.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the visiting !
clergymen were banqueted at the Hotel
Jullene, where covers were laid for. 400.
Archbishop TCeane was toastmaster. Car
dinal Gibbons responded to the toast "All
Hail to the Great Leo XIII, Pastor of the
Universal Church." The other toasts
were: "God Bless Our Country, the Home
of Civil and Religious Freedom," Bishop
Spaulding- of Peoria:' "Welcome to Our
Cardinal, to Our Archbishops and Bishops
and to All Our Honored Guests." Arch
bishop Elder, Cincinnati; "The Church in
the Great Northwest," Bishop O'Gorman,
Sioux Falls, S. D. Right Rev. Thomas J.
Conaty, having been called I to "Washing
ton, did not respond to the toast, "Success
to the Catholic University of America, the
Glorious Crown of Our Catholic Educa
tional System." Instead, however, brief
remarks on the subject were made by dis
tinguished churchmen present.
â â UBUQUE, Iowa, April 17.â In the
presence of princes and high
priests of his church and before
an audience that filled St. Ra
phael's Cathedral and overflowed
into the 6urrounding- streets, Archbishop
John J. Keane was to-day invested with
the pallium, the insignia of the high posi
tion he occupies in the Roman Catholic
church. While the absence of Monsignor
Martinelli was marked, it detracted none
from the grandeur of the scene, which
far surpassed that of September 17, 1S93,
when Monsignor Satolli, now a member
of the Sacred Congregation of Rome, con
ferred the pallium upon the late Arch
bishop Hennessey In this same cathedral.
The attendance of clergy and laymen from
abroad was very large and but few States
in the Union were unrepresented. It was a
remarkable tribute to Archbishop Keane.
Pontifical High Mass.
Archbishop' Kane of St.' Louis, in full
canonicals, ascended the altar at 10:30 and
commenced the celebration of pontifical
high mass. His assistant priest was Very
Rev. Gunn of Cedar Rapids, Deacon Very
Rev. McLaughlin of Clinton, Sub-Deacon
Very Rev. O'Connor. Carroll and some
thirty others. Revs. Toomey, Donlin,
Barry, Fitzpatrick and Carey were mas
ters of ceremonies.
The music was Gounod's "Messe Solen
nelle," sung by a choir of sixty persons.
At the close of . the mass Cardinal Gib
boris, with imposing ceremony, conferred
the pallium upon Archbishop Keane. The
Cardinal's assistants were Right Rev.
Monslgnor Ryan. V. G., of Dubuque and
Rev. Clement Johannes of Dubuque.
Following the investiture. Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul delivered the sermon
of the day. A congratulatory address
from the clergy of the diocese was made
by the Rev. Dr. Carroll, president of St.
Joseph's College, Dubuque, and-Archbish
op Keane's reply closed the ceremonies at
the church. â¢ '
Archbishop Ireland's Address.
The ereat feature of the day was the
installation address by Archbishop Ire
land. He regarded the installation as one
of the most important events in the Cath
olic church in recent years, Archbishop
Keane representing the forward move
ment in the church. Bishop Ireland's sub
ject was "The Church in - America â Its
Yesterday and Its To-morrow." He said:
I fear not to say that we have to-day in the
United States fourteen or fifteen millions of
Catholics. I speak, too, of the numbers of
churches, colleges, schacls, convents, hospitals,
orphanages and other institutions of piety,
charity, education and apostolic zeal, with
which the whole country is covered. Those are
riot the creations of the civil state or of rich
religious corporations; they are the results of
the pennies of the Catholic people, the em
bodiment in brick and stone of the sweat of
their brow, of their hard labor, bestowed freely
to God and his Christ. Glance down the naves
and aisles; notice thronging multitudes of men
as 'well as of women that press around the
altar rail, not merely on high festivals, but
on ordinary Sundays. And follow these mul
titudes into their homes, their shops and marts
as they mingle with their non-Catholic . fellow
citizens. Is there upon their lips a word of
disloyalty to church ? I- challenge the most
Catholic lands to show me Catholics more
courageous in the profession of their faith,
more consistent in bringing its principles into
their dally manner o? life, and j if, from its
exterior manifestations, you pass to an exam
ination of their faith itself it Is to the smallest
lota the faith of Peter, the supreme shepherd
of the whole flock, to whom they are united
in love and obedience as never were more so
Catholics of any country of Christendom.
Three-quarters of a century â a half a cen
tury agoâ anti-Catholic prejudice was dominant
in the land. Our non-Catholic fellow citizens
were not to be blamed; .they had not known
Catholics as Catholic3 are) and .they treated
them according to what they believed of them.
But to-day in America the reign of ill feeling
and animosity has passed away. In America
Catholics and non-Catholics differ from one an
other in creeds and spiritual allegiance; but,
as true Americans, they respect one another
and accord to one another their civil and so
cial- freedom, all working together in peace
and harmony for the greater weal of society
and of country.
Problem Before the Church.
. The problem before the "church of America
was whether the Catholic religion could pros
per in an atmosphere of absolute freedom,
without aid or prop from state organization or
even from compact - social or national tradi
tions; whether Â¦ from its innate vigor, watered
by the dews of heaven alone, it could live and
prosper. To one who believes in the - divine
origin of Catholic faith or has read diligently
its story of ages, the issue of the problem
should never have been doubtful. Tet, so ac
customed had Catholics been to see the church
allied with the state, or working only in popu
lations in whose sou's it was encrusted by
the accretions of centuries, that many in
America and more so in Europe were not will
ing to trust to its 'vitality when planted sud
denly, as it were, In the wilderness to battle,
alcf.e and unprotected with drouth and tem
pest. The problem was most interesting, for
this other reason, that, whether for woe or
weal, the entire world i* seen rapidly drifting
toward the social and. political , conditions of
America and the church on trial In America
is on trial for the world. [ ' . â¢ â¢ . . > Â¦
In America the Catholic faith was on trial
and so was democracy itself in Â¦ its relations
with religion. And aerjL. is the cause of so
many attacks made onftne American church.
Those attacks covertly. are attacks on democ
racy. It would have Deen most convenient for
reactionary : theorists to be able to say to
Catholics the world â¢ over â your church cannot
thrive in a - democracy,. In- the full- freedom
which democracy insu.-eh. -Thank God, to such
theorists both America and the Catholic church
and American democracy, have given saddest
disappointment. .J"4-'/' â¢ Â¦-". - .

NEWYORK, April 17.â Frank B. Loo
mis, United States Minister to Venezuela,
spent last night In quarantine with the
rest of the passengers on the Red J> liner
Caracas, on which he came from Porto
Rico. On disembarking to-day Mr. Lpomls
drove at once to the Hotel Victoria, where
he will be auartered until the end. of che
present week, when he goes to "Washing
ton to report to the State Department and
President McKinley. To a. correspondent
who met him at Quarantine to-day Mr.
Loomis said: â¢ ... "Â¦â¢' " "..
I did not say any of the unpleasant things
that have 'been attributed to me about Presi
dent - Castro during my stay at San Juan or
anywhere else. The fact is I like Mr. Castro
very much. I was interviewed at San Juan,
but it was more of a pleasant chat than any
thing else." There were other passengers aboard
and present who said Borne unkind things, but
I certainly did not. I cannot understand how
the criticisms were put in ' my mouth unless
the views .of the passengers alluded to were
made mine. I am quoted as saying that Presi
dent Castro drew but J12.000 a year salary, yet
had made $2,000,000 in two years. Now, I do
not even know positively that the President
gets the salary named and . I know nothing
of any money he has made. I also deny that
I . said he plotted to | secure my recall or re
moval. . . -' Â¦ ' Â¦ .. â¢â¢ â¢
I cannot discuss the. recent diplomatic in
cident with Venezuela. There are ! several
points In with it that I will report
on to the department and naturally they are
quite confidential.- I may say, however, that
the preliminary steps toward a legal settlement
of the asphalt case hare been taken in the
Venezuela courts.. That is precisely where our
Government wished the dispute to go. We In
sisted that the dispute be submitted for ad
judication without prejudice and carried our
point. I. do not say that our Government does
not reserve the right to intervene if Justice is
not done, but we want the matter passed upon
by the courts. . There was some feeling at :|he
height of the incident, but it has subsided
and our relations at the present time are quite
satisfactory. I câ¬nnot say how long it will
take to reach a decision in the asphalt cases;
I presume the law has its delays in Venezuela
as elsewhere. . . Â¦ â¢ Â¦
President Castro seems to have the country
quite under control. A . constitutional conven
tion, the eleventh . they have had, I believe,'
has adjourned and there is to be an election
in the autumn. It is quite certain that Castro
will be elected President and inaugurated next
spring. The constitutional convention has
changed the tenure of the President from four
to six years.-- Andrade is, I am told, at Cu
l-acao, and I feel that the report is true, for
there is generally a colony of Venezuelans
there, thinking of home and' anxious to im
prove the political- condition. I am told An
drade* plans an expedition to Venezuela, but
I do not anticipate any trouble for some
months. . .
Venezuelans who have discussed Andrade
with me say that while . he is well informed,
rather able and quite . broad-minded, he is
lacking in strength, and. too kind-hearted to
make a successful ruler. They say that an
other leader, a: younger man, will be brought
forward to oppose Castro. However, of all
these matters I [ have no personal knowledge
and am merely telling you what Venezuelans
say.
The Barcelona incident, in which our con
sular agent was twice arrested by local offi
cials in an attempt to eJttort .money from him,
flas been practically closed and in a manner
quite satisfactory to ra. Our Government di
rected me to demand an apology and the fullest
reparation. Just before leaving I was Riven
assurance that the fullest . amends will be
made. " I believe that the assurances given me
will be carried out. Â¦ /.
I do not expect to return to Venezuela for
at least five, months. Four years in the tropics
have left me in. need of change nad rest; 'my
physician says Carlsbad. . and > I - am ! going to
try and get leave for-a.trip to Europe.

at any Drevious time.
The Danish Government ridicules the
reiterated reports published , in English

regarding the sale of the "islands have
been received from the United States,

United States Government has shown

Judge Estee Delivers a
Lecture to the
Hawaiians.
HONOLULU, April 9.â United States
District Judge Estee to-day delivered the
charge to the first Federal - Grand Jury
ever called together here. He adminis
tered a scathing rebuke to the community
and the authorities for permitting the es
tablishment and maintenance of. the re
sort known as Iwalei, a local Toshlwara,
which Circuit Judge Humphreys some
time ago called upon the Territorial
Grand Jury to proceed against.
Judge Estee charged the jury to Inves
tigate reports that the women at Iwalei,
who are nearly all Japanese, are slaves
of their husbands, brothers or owners,
and he said there was not another equal
sized town in the United States where so
many such women are congregated In one
place and protected by public officers.
The Judge referred to Iwalei as an of
fense against law and decency and
charged the jury to proceed against all
persons who have had anything to do
with keeping or maintaining the big ln
closure at Iwalei, in which there are now
1M women.
The Territorial Legislature is now In
the midst of a hard fight over, the pro
posed liquor dispensary law. The bill has
been before the Senate In .various stages
for several days and committee reports
for and against it have been made.
The House has Jellied a bill to make the
old flag of the Hawaiian nation the Ter
ritorial emblem on the ground that. it Is
not the rule for Territories of the United
States to have flags of their own. The
bill to allow the former Queen $12,000 a
year as a pension has two substitutes â
one proposing to give her $250,000 In a
lump sum and the other to make at this
time an appropriation of $12,000 for her
for the next two years. Most of the In
dependents are understood to favor giv
ing the $250,000.
The House has finally passed a bill to
provide for the use of the Hawaiian as
well as the English language in the Cir
cuit Courts of the Territory. Since an
nexation only Entrlish has been allowed
in courts of record.

LONDON, April 17.â A South African
blue book containing recent dispatches
frcm Sir Alfred Milner and other official
correspondence way issued to-night.
Sir Alfred Mllner -wired under date of
March 3 requesting permission to return,
home at an early date upon leave of ab
sence for the purpose of resting. Joseph
Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, .re
plied by granting this request, but ex*
pressing the Government's regret that it
should be necessary for Sir -Alfred to
leave South Africa at the present time,
quite recognizing, however, his need. for
rest and mentioning' three months as a
possible period of absence.
In a dispatch dated February C Sir Al
fred Milner reviews the situation in
South Africa and says that he had hoped
some definite point would be reached at
which it would be possible to sum up that
chapter of history containing the ways
and forecast of administrative recon
struction which must succeed it. He
adds: .
But I em reluctantly forced to the conclu
sion that there will be no euch dividing line
and I have not the slightest doubt of the ulti
mate result, but I foresee that the work will
be slower, more difficult, more harassing an!
more expensive than was at any time antici
pated. At any rate It is idls to wait longer
in the hope of being able to discover a clear
and clean-cut situation. In spite of tho con
fused character of the present position I think
it better to attempt to discover, however
roughly and Inadequately, the state of things as
they are to-day. It is no use denying that the
last - half of the year has been one of retro
gression. Seven months ago this colony was
perfectly quiet, at least as far as the Orange
River. .The southern half of, the Orange River
Colony was rapidly settling down, and even a
considerable portion of the Transvaal, notably
the southwestern districts, seemed to have defi
nitely accepted British authority and to rejoice
at the opportunity to return to orderly govern
ment and the pursuits of peace. !
To-day the scene is completely altered. It
would be superfluous to dwell on the increased
losses to the country caused by the prolonga
tion of the struggle by the form which It has
recently assumed. I
The enemy are now broken up into a great
number of small forces, raiding In every di
rection, and that our troops are broken up
in their pursuit makes the area of actual fight-
Ing and consequently of destruction much
wider than would be the case in a conflict
between equal numbers operating lc large
masses. Moreover, the fight is now mainly
over supplies. The Boers live entirely. on the
country through which they pass, not only
taking all the food they can lay their hands
on, but looting the small village stores of
clothes, boots, coffee and sugar, all of which
they are in great need of. Our forces are com
pelled to denude the Â¦ country of everything
movable in order to frustrate these tactics of
the enemy. The loss of crops and ptock is
more serious to the Boers than farm burning,
of which so much has been heard. I say this
not at all as an advocate of such destruction
and I am glad to think the measure is now
seldom if ever resorted to.
The consequences of the war, although not
grave, are appalling. The country people will
need help to prevent them from starving, and
probably a certain amount of capital. A more
serious effect of the last six months is tho
moral Influence of the recrudescence of the
war, especially In Orange River colony.

Like Older People,
They Prefer It to
Other Grain
Foods.
Malt Breakfast Food, because of Its pre-
digested character, is adapted for the
young as well as the old. It satisfies and
nourishes growing children, builds up
bone, tissue and muscle and keeps the
ctomach and bowels in perfect order from
day to day.
Halt Breakfast Food once tried in the
home at once meets the approval and ex-
pectations of every member of the family.
Its delicious flavor captivates every pal-
ate.
"No more oatmeal for us," Is the deci-
sion of the thousands who have tried
Halt Breakfast Food. Appetizing, nutri-
tious, energizing, easily digested and read-
ily absorbed are a few of the many grand
qualities of Malt Breakfast Food. Your
grocer sells It.

THERE appears ; to be no obstacle
insurmountable ' by Barney
Schreiber's. Corrigan, for the
brown colt captured the Western
Foal stakes,' worth $3815. at Tan
foran yesterday-far -more Impressively
than was his yvln on Saturday last of the
rich Great Trial stake; r In this last tri
umph he had only a small field to subdue
and completed the task, like a master
workman.- He picked:up 126 pounds, and
as both Flora Pomona, and. Doreen were
h.:avily supported,- the friends of Schrei
ber's .cfilt got as gobd>s Vh to 1 against
their money. The Burns- & \Vaterhouse
folks were so enthusiastic over the
chances of their filly Doreen, with Nash
Turner in the Saddle, that she. closed a
3 to 2 favorite. When Jake. Holtman re
leased ,th*e barrier to : a pretty break the
result could quickly be foretold. Dom
inick astride Corrigan waited on Flora
Pcmona to the stretch before playing his
high card. No whip was necessary, for
long* before the wire was within reach
Corrigan had a mortgage on the long end
of the stake, winning cleverly by more
than a length in 1:01. and this in the face
of the usual trade winds that sweep the
stretch. Doreen, on which it looked as if
Turner took matters' too patiently, fin
ished third, a couple of lengths behind
the Shulte entry. Royalty, Yrsula and
Evander were never factors. , ' '\
First choices picked up some ih their
form, which has been somewhat speckled
of late, by winning three events. Dom
inick and Ransch . divided honors in the
saddle, each riding two horses that se
cured brackets.
After being placed on several occasions
Barney Schreiber's mare Foul Play finally
won a purse. She closed favorite over
Necklace for the first event at five and a
half furlongs, and beat the latter lnare
easily after taking the lead at the, bend
for home. By hard. riding Turner landed
the show with Saul of Tarsus.-
In the four and a half furlong scramble
for two-year-olds Schreiber pressed his
luck by putting a good sized' commission
down on Zirl at 4. to 5 and the crowd fol
lowed him. The black Miss led to. the
paddock, where she was nabbed by
Alounce on the 8 to 1 shot Jarre tierred' Or
and beaten two- lengths.- Ogle downed
Innocertcia for the show. ., ,
The hurdle sketch over one mile and a
half was replete with pathos and fun. It
may have looked good to some, but to
others it bore all the earmarks Of a
"shoo-in." The smart money. went in on
Hueston's ' mount, Sam Howard, cutting
the' price from 10 to 4 l A" and he won all
the way. J O C, Under half steam, got in
several blocks, ahead of Viking for the
place, the latter breaking a crankpin
vhen several leagues off shore. Delconte
on Dunboy took a header at the jump ih
front of the stand. While looking more
like a winner than the final purse-getter^
Herculean fell taking the fourth jump,
and Cairns, his rider, was severely shaken
up, besides having ills collarbone frac
tured.
For- some reason the books laid as good
as 3 against Scotch Plaid, winner of the
mile and a sixteenth selling affair. Ransch
took the lead with the Midlothian horse
when ready and won galloping from Dan
gerous Maid. Precursor dropped in a dis
tant third, while Wyoming wheeled at the
start and was left.
With MacGyle out of the way, any price
looked rosy about Bernota, and at odds
of 3 to 10 the three-year-old breezed for
the concluding mile run. Maydine, next
in demand, led out Tony Lepping for the
place.

There was plenty of business in the
claiming line after the race won by Scotch
Plaid. Sam Hildreth's mare Dangerous
Maid -was claimed by both George Miller
and Carruthers & Shields, the latter firm
having the call because of Precursor run
ning third. The mare stood the firm $900.
In retaliation Hlldreth then claimed Sir
Hampton on Miller, getting the brown
horse for $800. Doss & Co., owners of

1 Will Remain.
Jake Holtman will rc?jtinue to wield
the flag- for several week? and -when he re
turns East F. E. Mulho'land will succeed"
him with the crimson.
The New California Jockey Club will as
sume full charge of racing at Tanforan on
Saturday: It is announced that no changes
will be made in the official corns or per
sons holding concessions at Tanforan dur
ing next week's racing at that track.
When the racing shifts to Oakland Judgu
Pettingill, now presiding judge at Tanfo 1 
ran, will occupy the stand with Judfro
Murphy during the absence of Associace
Judge Edward Hopper in the East. Â¦ ,
Mr. Williams is entitled to take posses
sion of the Tanforan track to-morrow
â¢ Friday), but superstition causes him to
disfavor assuming control of the racing
there on that supposedly unlucky day, so
he will take charge one day later.
Yesterday was a busy day with the turf
magnates. Their attorneys were busy pre
paring the papers necessary for the legal
transfer of the several tracks to the New
<"alifornia Jockev Cluo. During- the day-
Thomas H. Wiliiams Jr. obtained from
Mrs. Margaret Meade 3 seventeen years'
lease of the ground on which' the Oakland
track is built, with the privilege of buying
the property at the of that
time.
To-day at 1:30 Thomas H. Williams Jr.,
representing the New California Jockey
Club, will meet Prince Andre Poniatow
ski, president of the San Francisco
Jockey Club, at the latter's office and pay
to him the sum of J2Â»,000, which const 1 
tuteg the first installment of ihe'amoun:
to be paid for the Tanforan and Ingleside
racetracks.
Together with their attorneys the direct
ors of the old Pacific Coast Jockey Club,
the Western Turf Association and the San
Francisco Jockey Club formally put their
respective associations out Â¦ of business.
Last night the directors of the California
Jockey Club assigned al 1 . its interests to
the "New California Jockey Club," the
title of the new corporation which had to
be orgranlz<?d to comply with some techni Â¦
cat construction of tht statutes.
A general clearing of the local turf
decks was accomplished yesterday when
the directors of four separate racing or
ganizations met and turned over to the
new California Jockey Club their proper
ties and franchises 'preparatory to the or
ganization of the corporation which will
in future have absolute control of the
California turf.

of having, murdered William Trewhella,
his partner, at the Windsor Hotel on Jan
uary 14 last," was resumed yesterday morn-'
ing. Â¦ ' .Â¦ -..:,.. â¢â¢ . . . : . Â¦ .â¢
Juror M. Hanson, whose illness caused
the trial to be postponed for two davs,
came into court yesterday in- a feeble
condition. Owing to thu chilly atmos
phere of Judge Dunne's courtroom Judge
Sloss kindly consented tu allow his court
room to be used -for the Glaze trial, it-be
ing a- sunny,, apartment. ".
Glaze took. the witness stand yesterday
and, with composure, told his story of the
shooting of Trewhella. He testified to the
frequent quarrels between himself and
his partner, caused by Trewhella's suspi
cions that he was not being- treated fairly.
The defendant also stated how his wife
had come to his room on the evening be
fore the shooting. .. and complained that
Trewhella had treated ner roughly and in
sulted her by calling ner "a drunken
woman." .'Â¦:-Â¦;
"My wife wanted me to go down to
Trewhella's room and demand an apol
ogy," said Glaze, "and she : also wanted
me to send for the patrol wagon and have
Trewhella' arrested. I did not go down to
Trewhella's room, as I knew he was angry
and excited, and advised my wife to wait
until the next day."- -
Glaze recounted his doings on the morn
ing of the fatal day when Trewhella was
killed. He told how he had gone down
town on business anl also how he had
purchased cartridges for his revolver. -
Glaze's Version of Shooting.
"I always carry a revolver," said Glaze,
"and the man who sold me the cartridges
said it was out of order and he repaired
It. I went up to the hotel and had my
lunch. That morning Tiewhella had met
me in the kitchen and said to me, 'Do
you want to take up the side of that
drunken wife of yours?' I told Trewhella
that I /lid not -wish co auarrel -with him
and that all my wife's money was tied up
in the hotel. I told him I was making ar
rangements to buy him out, and he said;
using an oath," 'If you don't give me my
money I will kill you.' 1 went away from,
him. That was in the morning. After!
came back to the hotel and had my- lunch
I worked on the. booKs. â¢ I had an ap
pointment with the mar. who was to iet
me have the loan on chattel mortgage.
I wanted Trewhella's signature to a doc
ument and I went to look for him. ,1
knew that he was always in the back
part of the house. I looked around for him
but did not see. him. Therias I entered the
door of the old "bakery on the alley side
Trewhella came in at the other door. He
said 'What! you here attain? I will kill
you/ Immediately I nulled my pistol and
fired. I saw something glitter In his hand.
The room ; became full of smoke'and I re
treated out into the alley. I 'broke' my
pistol and put new cartridges into it.
3>eiiies Seeing O'Connor. 1
"I did not- not know whether' or not
Trewhella would follow me up|". I did not
know he was hurt. -1 :werit around into
the kitchen, walked through It and came
into the court. Porter'; 'met: me-, as I
was near the kitchen. door and caught me
by the arm. The -bellboy, O'Connor, I
did not see until I^got.into the office. I
saw Trewhella lying' by. the kitchen door.
I thought I had hurt him: and determined
to give myself up -to- the police. I gave
my pistol to Albert Sheliey, the clerk, and
then went out with Porter to find an offi
cer. I never spoke tojO' Connor that after
noon and did not tejl hlm^to say that
Trewhella had Bhat'.'himselfi- I' honestlv
believed at the time 'I flredl.that my life
was In danger." *'Â¦" Â¦'â¢.**Â¦
Glaze was the last witness on the stand
yesterday and his cross-examination will
begin this morning. ' Â¦ â¢ *
Mrs. Glaze was also called as a wit
ness by the defense. She testified that
on the night before the shotting she had
gone to Mrs. Trewhella's room to find out
why certain rooms had not been prepared
for guests. Mrs. Glaze stated that her
daughter Edith accompanied her and that
Mrs. Trewhella came to the door when
called. Tlv? witness testified that Mrs.
Trewhella was insulting in her manner
and shut the door in her face. She claim
ed that Trewhella came out of the room
and roughly handled her and that she was
unable to cry out for help. "He accused
me of being drunk*," said Mrs. Glaze, "and
told me to go to bed." Â¦ v - . â¢
.The witness denied that she was intoxi
cated at the time or was addicted to liquor
or that she had ' attempted to strike the
blind mother of Mrs. Trewhella, She also
denied having forced her way into Â¦ the
rooms of the Trewhellas and that Trew
hella had gently pushed her out of the
room.
Miss Edith Shelley told a similar Btory
to that of her mother, but on cross-ex
amination admitted that she begged her
mother to leave the room.
â¢ Miss Mabel Shelley testified that on the
night of Oie shooting the bellboy, O'Con
nor, came to her mother's rooms and told
them 1 that two detectives were in the of
fice and wanted to question him, but that
he had told the officers, nothing about the
shooting. ; â¢
Say Glaze Was Peaceable;
J. P. Gallagher, John Morrisey, J. S.
Young and H. L. Smith were called by
the defense to testify to the reputation of
Glaze for peace and ; quietness . generally
in the community.
C. D. Davis testified to negotiating: with
Glaze for a loan on chattel mortgage on
the furniture of the Windsor Hotel. S.
Mayers also gave evidence that Trewhella
had informed him of trouble with .Glaze;
and that unless Glaze gave him his money
back more trouble would result. 1 ' '
Albert Shelley, stepson of Glaze, testi
fied that he did not see the shooting: of
Trewhella. He told how Glaze had come
into the office, given witness his pistol
and thrown cartridges on the floor. Â¦ >
On cross-examination Shelley admitted
that he had advised Glaze to go out and
give himself ud.
George L. Deal, called by the defense,
testified that he was in the bar of the ho
tel when he.heardshots fired, and that he
ran down to the court at the foot of the
stairs. Â¦ Â¦
"I saw Glaze coming out of the kitch
en," said Deal, "and the body of Trew
hella was Â¦ lying near the I kitchen door.
I saw O'Connor standing close by the
spot. â¢ I spoke to him and asked him what
the trouble was. I think he could have
seen the shots fired from where he was
standing." " r â¢ . :
"Have you changed yoyr mind since you
gave evidence at the inquest?" asked At
torney Foote. "Did you not say before
the Coroner that in your opinion you did
not think that O'Connor could have seen
the shots 'fired?"
The prosecution objected, to the ques
tion and the court ruled that it was im
proper.- At: the close of the proceedings
yesterday. Judge Dunne informed counsel
that -the .case must - close to-day. The
hearing will be resumed this morning at
9:30 o'clock. 5 â¢-. :

"I am feeling quite well," writes Miss Dorcas

D. C.,Â«and I owe it all to Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery. I had been quite a sufferer
for a longtime, and after reading Dr. Pierces
Common Sense Medical Adviser thought I would
try his â¢ Golden Medical DiacoTery.* I had not
been sleeping well for a long time. Took one tea-
spoonful of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery and slept nearly all night without cousrhiusr.
so I continued taking it. I. had been a great
sufferer for more than ten years. I tried lots of
aifierent medicines and different doctors but

commenced spitting blood, but now I feel much
stronger and am entirely well."

bills. No blanket-tossing was attempted,
and the men of the Thirty-third leave the
service free from any fear of arrest. Â¦: 1
It was different with the men of- the
Thirty-fourth. They -had procured all
the civilian clothing they needed and had
made, up their, minds to "beat" the mer
chants who had trusted them. Colonel
Rawles' passes were. not recognized and
collectors were not allowed in the camp
by the commanding: officer, and very few
men. presented themselves at the store
where the goods were obtained to pay
their bills.' Â¦-Â¦.,...
As a result of this display on the part
of the soldiers of a desire to get all they
could for nothing: orders were issued yes
terday calling in the passes issued to mer
chants and Informing the dealers that all
credit business done in the future would
be on their own responsibility.
It was feared that a repetition of the
maltreatment afforded the merchants
during: the muster out of the . Thirtieth
Infantry would occur, and a guard of
fifty armed men was distributed through
out the camps to prevent roug:h treat
ment. The presence of the gruard, under
command of the officer of the day, damp
ened the ardor of the men and they al
lowed the civilians^to pursue their busi
ness without molestation.
The merchants who do business with the
soldiers about to be discharged at the
Presidio were given little satisfaction
or .coin yesterday. \ The' Thirty-third
and Thirty-fourth regiments were mus
tered out, and out of the hundreds of men
who purchased civilian outfits the mer
chants received about 5 per cent of the
money due them.
The colonel of the .Thirty-fourth issued
peremptory . orders to exclude . every one
from the camp, despite the possession of
a pass to enter the reservation, ' and as a
result the merchants lose thousands of
dollars. .. â¢ Â¦ . -

Colonel Walker was distinguished for up
rightness and honor In all his dealings and
for faithfulness to duty. He was a man

fairness, tolerance and sound Judgment.

Association and of the Joint Committee
of the Trunk Line and Central Traffic
Associations, as Receiver of the Atchison,

and as Chairman of the board, he per
formed all his duties with credit to him
self and to the satisfaction of all. The
wide range of his official duties and his
cordial human sympathies brought him

Although it is not possible by formal
resolution to express either our personal
feelings or sorrow for the death of Aldace
K. Walker or our sense of the loss which
this company has sustained, we wish to
record permanently our appreciation of
his character and ability, and of. Ms ser
vices to this company.
The following vote was adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe Railway Company at
a special meeting held on April 13, 1501:
TRIBUTE TO AN
HONORABLE CAREER
Aside from the Presidential party none
but club members will attend the lunch
eon, as it is the desire of the President.
as expressed to Mr. Abbott, to have as
quiet and restful a time as possible.
The. tables will be spread in the Maple
room of the Palace. In the line of dec
oration fresh flowers, ferns and smilax
will be amply used. Good music will be
provided for the occasion. The luncheon,
which will surely be an elaborate affair.
will doubtless relieve the pressure for
tickets to the great banquet at the Pal
ace Hotel on the evening of May 18.
Preparations for the Â»banquet of the
Ohio Society, scheduled to take place
earlier in the week, are going forward.
The Buckeyes are planning for the en
tertainment of a multitude. According to
reports, the demand for Invitations to the
banquet simply overwhelms the manage
ment. The Ohio Society perhaps made a
mistake in not arranging for a barbecue
in the suburbs.
Making elaborate Preparations.
The league is making elaborate prep
arations to receive its distinguished
guests. Besides the President there will
be the various members of the Cabinet
and others of the President's party. It
has been arranged to have the President
leave the Union Iron Works on a tug im
mediately following the launching of the
Ohio at 12:26 p. m., and be escorted from
the ferry In carriages to the rooms of the
Lnion League Club. It Is expected that
the President will reach the clubrooms at
1 o'clock and luncheon will be served Im
mediately thereafter.
When Attorney General Ford was In
Â¦Washington last year he invited the Pres
ident to visit the club when he should
come to California and the President
agreed to do so. t
Mr. Abbott has returned from his trip,
and In his report to the club states that
the President has so arranged his itin
erary as to be present at the luncheon to
fcc given by the club at its clubrooms,
Palace Hotel, on Saturday, May 18, imme
diately following the launching of the bat
tleship Ohio. George D. Clark, president
of the Union League, received a message
from Washington yesterday confirming
the foregoing arrangement.
On March 16 last the Union League Club
of San Francisco sent William M. Ab
bott, Deputy Attorney General, as Its rep
resentative to Washington to formally
present to the President its invitation to
dine with the club upon the occasion of
his visit to San Francisco in May next.
The invitation was engraved upon a
golden plate and has been accepted by the
President.
Golden Plate Invitation.
The managers of the Union Iron Works
expected to entertain the Presidential
party and the Ohio delegation at the ship
yards Immediately after the launching of
the battleship, but this function has been
canceled in favor of the Union-League
Club.
TVhen the President saw the original
profiramme for his entertainment in San
Frar.clsco he was astounded at the num
ber of functions in which he was listed to
participate. In line with his suggestion
an effort has been made to give him more
time to rest. The Mexican Veterans,
Pioneers and Native Sons have consoli
datcr their receptions. The dedication of
the Donahue fountain, a function which
Mayor Phelan suggested, will occupy but
little time. The President will simply
pause on his way to the train bound for
fc&cramento to attend the unveiling.
The Sons and Daughters- of the Ameri
can Revolution have not Joined In the
function at Mark Hopkins Institute, but
will not detain the President for an un
usual length of time at the parlors of the
Palace Hotel. The Grand Army posts
have consolidated to meet the distin
guished comrade at Xatlj-e Sons' Hall and
make it easy for him.

' .Mr. .Lloyd adds that in view of the law
the Auditor has no right to inquire into

appointed and that if the demands â¢ were
not paid the courts would have the au

In a letter addressed to the Civil Serv
ice Commissioners Auditor Wells cites
the opinion of Mr. Lloyd and states that
in view, thereof . he will be i compelled to
pay the demands of the new copyists as
they are presented. ' â¢â¢ â¢
In reference to the power of appoint
ment'on the, part of the Recorder the
charter says:
All assistants, deputies and other subordinate
officers â¢ whose appointments are not otherwise
provided for must be appointed by the officer
or body, to whom they are respectively subor
dinate. Â¦ . . ,-. Â¦ Â¦. .
When the number of such deputies or sub
ordinate officers is not fixed by law â¢â¢ it - is
limited only by the discreticn of the 'appoint

Mr. Lloyd, in his recommendation to the
Auditor, Â¦ quotes -the following extracts
from the Political Code:

made on the demands of the four copyists
lately appointed by Recorder Godchaux.
Relying upon : the recent decision of 'the
Supreme Court, the Recorder maintains
that be has the authority to appoint his
own employes, contrary to the opinion of
the Civil Service Commissioners. .
Last night the directors decided to in
stall Bosquet's successor in office to-day.
Bosquet will be handed a check for j his
salary this morning and .told that the
French Hospital will be forbidden ground
to him hereafter. ' - . â¢
President Dupas and his associates were
indignant at the attempt to create trou
ble, and informed the employes and
nurses that no changes were contem
plated in the working force as long as
they all attended to their duties'.
in the past few days the employes ana
nurses asked for definite information as
to when they were to be discharged,
threatening to quit work unless the in
formation desired was forthcoming. The
directors questioned the employes and
nurses and learned from them that ; Bos
quet had given them to understand they
were to be treated with scant mercy I by
the new directors.- " Â¦ , .
A new superintendent will take charge
of the French Hospital in place of Mr.
Bosquet this morning, when the latter of
ficial will be asked to retire by the board
of directors of the French Benevolent So
ciety.
The board met last evening and unani
mously elected Alexander Mlqueu as su
perintendent to succeed Bosquet, who was
notified a week ago that his services
would not be required after the end of the
month.
The reason alleged for the immediate
"conge" of 'Bosquet Is that the board of
directors feel he has tried to hurt | the
hospital management by telling the em
ployes and nursing staff that in a few
days they would all be discharged. -

MRS. NELLJE RIVIERRE, WHO
HAS BEEN RECONCILED TO
RUNAWAY HUSBAND.
ALEXANDER MIQUEU SUCCEEDS BOSQUET AS SUPERINTENDENT
OF FRENCH HOSPITAL, THE TRANSFER BEING MADE TO-DAY
A BRIGHT little woman leading a
child by the hand and carrying a
valise walked into Captain Sey
mour's office yesterday afternoon
and announced that she was
Mrs. Nellie R*l\ierre, whose husband was
accused of kidnaping their little boy, Rey
nold from Denver. Mrs. Rivierre left Den
ver Sunday night and arrived here yester
day morning. She went straight to the
house of Mrs. Lage, lOSVi Fell street,
where the. boy was kept, but found that
he had been taken away.
Mrs. Rivlerre told Captain Seymour that
she was determined to regain possession
of the boy. They were living happily in
Denver, she said.^when her husband dis
appeared with the little fellow. Rivierre
had told her he was going, to New York
as a witness in an accident case and had
received money for his traveling expenses,
but Instead of going there he came here.
He had also â¢wired to her aunt, Mrs. Sarah
C. Patterson, 33 Monroe place, Brooklyn,
that she was dead, and asked Mrs. Pat
tersfin to send him $150 for expenses to
take the body to New York for interment
in Greenwood Cemetery. Mrs. Rivierre
showed a letter from her aunt, dated
April 5, corroborating her statement and
telling her she had wired the $150 to him.
He had surreptitiously packed up every
thing of value before his departure, in
cluding even the forks and spoons, and
had pawned some and taken the others
with him. '
Husband and Wife Meet.
Mrs. Rivierre denied emphatically the
charges of unfaithfulness her husband
had made against her, and said the re
verse was the truth. He had known about
her little girl before they were married,
five years ago, and was fully satisfied, she
said. As an evidence of his impecunioslty,
she said that on the day they were mar
ried she had to give him the money to
pay the minister who performed the cer
emony, and next morning. he borrowed $10*
from her. He took her to Weisbaden to
visit his parents, but they would not re
ceive him, as his stepmother did not like
him, and. he deserted her there, leaving
her penniless. A stranger had to pay her
steerage passage' back to New York and
a lady paid Â¦ her hotel bill. She got em
ployment as housekeeper with a gentle
man, and about four months later' her
husband made his appearance and they
went to housekeeping again. His brother
Gaston is the famous French' bicycle rider,
and her husband on more than one occa
sion represented himself as Gaston. She
believed her husband was mentally un
balanced. â¢ . : " â¢ ;
Captain Seymour read the dispatches he
had sent to the Denver chief, showing
that the latter had been negligent in not
forwarding the warrant for Rivierre's ar
rest. She said she did not know what
charge was In the warrant, but thought it
was obtaining money by Â¦ false pretenses.
The present chief, she said, had only been
in office for a few days, and that might
account for his negligence. The captain
thought she and he? husband should kiss
and make up, but she said she only want
ed her boy. Captain Seymour telephoned
for Rivlerre to call at his office, as his
wife was there, and he made his appear
ance about 5 o'clock. His wife was in the
detectives' room, and neither looked at'
the other. Rivlerre went Into the cap
tain's office and in a few minutes his wife
was called in. â¢
Stare Coldly, Tlien Melt.
After the couple had stared at each oth
er for several minutes v/ithout the least
sign of recognition the head of the De
tective Department asked Rivierre if he
did not know his wifft.
"She don't seem anxious to soeak to
me," he rather sheepishly â¢ replied. "I'm
willing to make up if the wants to." .
""Will you promise to be good?" anxious
ly inauired Mrs. Rivierre, as" she arosn
from her chair and walked toward her
husband.' â¢
"I'll take care of you and our child/'
timidly answered Rivierre. "You know. I
always tried to do the right thing by
you.". ' " - .
"Comeâ shake hands," commanded Cap
tain Seymour.. "Forget your past
troubles and try to do rigrnt in the future."
Rivlerre . then walked over to his wife
and, taking, her extended , hand, warmly
shook it. Â¦ . -.Â¦Â¦'.Â¦Â¦ â¢ . .. . :
"Let's be friends," he said. "If you only
do what is right we can live happily in.
San Francisco." - â¢ . > â¢â¢Â¦Â¦'.
"I am - willing to forget our past
troubles," answered Mrs. Rivierre. "for
the sake of our little dnughter. Let us call
our present troubles off." â¢ â¢. . â¢ â¢Â¦.â¢-
J The reunited couple then left the Hall of
Justice, followed by their little girl, ap- i
parently pleased at their reconciliation.

San Francisco. April 17, 1901.
and approved by the corporation counsel,
to sell to the city 200,000,000 gallons of
wa.ter a day for forty years at $70 a mil
lion gallons. The Merchants' Association
and the City Comptroller, Bird S. Coler,
demanded that time be given to show that
the contract, was inequitable and fraudu
lent, and that under municipal ownership
the price would be far cheaper.. The con
tract was set aside by a court of equity
on the showing made by the "Merchants'
Association after a long and arduous com
pilation of the city's records for the past
sixty-six years. The. Merchants' Associa
tion was able to show that the cost of
water to the city of New York In 1898 was
only $29 07 per million gallons, and that
the Ramapo contract was a gigantic fraud
by which the city of New York would
lose $145,000,000 In forty years. In the re
cent State election in New York the Ra
mapo contract was an issue; all parties
were " pledged to rescind the powers and
privileges of the Ramapo Company and
to remove every restriction heretofore
Imposed by hostile legislation against the
extension of New York's municipal water
supoly. These reforms were favored by
the 'people of New York, and it was only
the other day that laws accomplishing the
desired results "were passed by the NeV
York Legislature and signed by Governor
Odell. ;~ " â¢ ' '.Â«Â¦
. In the report ; of the Merchants' Asso
ciation on the Ramapo contract they
show that "from January l, 1832,-to De
cember 31, 1898, the city of New York made
a capital investment of $86,359,562 09 for the
construction of water works. It expended
during that period, for' interest charges,
-maintenance and operation $66,544,245 3S ;
the aggregate earnings were $88,017,329 72;
the total net proflt3 were $21,473,084 34."â
"Water Supply of the City of New York,"
page 6.
They recommend that, ."the policy of
supplying New York City with water by
contract should be opposed by all lawful
means."â "AVater Supply of the City of
New >York," page 23.
And finally they say: "The financial
history of the New York water supply, as
well Â¦ as the ' water â¢ supply ; of Brooklyn
alike, demonstrates that, considered mere
ly â¢ as a financial investment, city owner
ship and. control Is profitable and exceed
ingly advantageous. There is, therefore,
no reason for. reversing the policy which
has been - pursued for almost seventy
years. Â¦â¢-Â¦â¢ â¢ For New York. now to re

-.When to those differences in the showing made by
the statistics for the two years there is added the fur
ther fact that our exports to China have been cut
down about 50 per cent by the war it-will be seen that
the figures of exports to foreign countries do not give
a fair basis of comparison or measurement *of ; the
progress, of our export , trade. The jdeclirie in the
Chinese trade is clearly, only a temporary one. As
soon as peace is 4 established in that country and trade
is resumed it is probable we shall have an export trade
to the Chinese" market which will far exceed that of
the past. ' ..': ' . -:-.-. .;. v .
, It appears from the summary given out that the"
total exports to the Haftaiian Islands in the" fiscal year
1900 were $13,500,060, and to Porto Rico over $4,500,
000, making a total "'of 'more than $i8,ooo,oba The
shipments to Porto Ric&ithis year are 'known .to have
largely increased over those of last year, and it is pre
sumed there has been a similar increase in shipments
to Hawaii. . Neither of thole shipments, however,
figure any longer in om- foreign. exports. It is ap'par
ent, then, that upward of $20,000,000 of actual ship
ments will not be included in the official statistics
this year, though "sent to countries that have hitherto
been classified as foreign. ,
The Bureau points out- that there are three reasons
for the apparent decline in manufactured exports.
r.The exporters engaged in. commerce with the Ha
waiian Islands are now' refusing to furnish to the
Bureau of Statistics the statements of-their exports-as
in former years, holding that their exports are no
longer "foreign commerce," and that therefore the
Bureau has no authority to require the usual state
ments which the law authorizes with reference to
commerce between the United States and foreign
countries. 2., The exports to Porto Rico are now
separately classified and: no longer included in the
general statement, of foreign commerce. 3. The ex
ports to China have temporarily fallen oft one-half
by reason of the unsettled Conditions in. that country.
EXPORTS OF MANUFACTURES.
SINCE there has been some comment on the de
cline in the value of American exports of
manufactured gooo* as compared with those, 1 of
last year, the Treasury Bureau of Statistics hasltaken
occasion to point out that the figures which on their
face show a decline are misleading. Â¦ When the total is
made up for the.year the showing may be less than
that of a year ago, but when all things are taken into
consideration the -result will not be so bad as it
seems. â r >
The time .has come for cities and counties of Cali
fornia tornake known tlieir resources and advantages
The; Southern .States have; been doing an extensive
amount of ) advertising Â¦ of recent 'years and have de
rived a benefit from every dollar, spent in that way.
The attractions of California are so much superior to
anything. the South can^ offer to "either business men
or. pleasure-seekers that if 'they were made known
throughout the East we would profit .to an-- even
greater, degree than the South ' has done. At any
rate. it will be worth while for our progressive coun
ties to take note that'thousands of . well-to-do Eastern
people are i migrating in search of new .homes and to
take' steps to attract them to California.
In view of the migration the action of the railroads
in offering low rates for excursions to California is r a
trost i timely one. It will help to v draw to' this State
many home-seekers who .might otherwise never : have
thought of coming here. We are thus put, so far as
rates of transportation- are concerned, on something
of an equality with the Northwest and the South, and
it will be largely our cwn fault if ' we do not gain
from the movement a desirable addition to our.popu
lation;-." V ; Â¦ "
â¢ It is noted that there isa considerable difference
between the home-seekei c- , of the new migration and
those who moved West in former times. The earlier
movement was made up mainly by men in search. of
Government lands; which they could obtain under the
homestead laws. As a rule most of them were com
paratively moneyless. Some of them had to mott-.
gage their land for money to buy farm implements
and stock, or for food, supplies until they could raise,
and market a crop: The present movement is made :
up of people of some means.. They expect to buy
land . and have, the money for - doing so. '-.. Moreover,\
many of the home-seekers of the. past were inexpe
rienced men, who came West only because they could
get land for nothing. They.knew little about farming,
but counted on making a living until their farms , be
came valuable and then selling them when there were Â¦
110 longer any public lands in- their neighborhood.
The home-seekers of to-day are men of experience.
They understand their trade and are therefore ; likeiy
to be much more successful than their predecessors. ."
OUR Eastern exchanges announce that not since
the early eighties has there been such a migra
tion of farmers and other home-seekers from
Ih'e East as is now going on.- A continuous stream
of them flows through. St. Paul to the Northwestern
States, and almost as many are moving to the South
ern States either to engage in farming or to take pan
in the upbuilding of manufacturing industries which
have recently formed so important a feature in South
ern development. -
THE MIGRATION OF FARMERS.
WHEN the President and his party leave Call- .
fornia they will go north, and after other steps
will sojourn in Montana. The programme- for
their entertainment in the mountain State is sugges
tive of some omissions in the itinerary provided for
them in California. .
They arc to have a restful stay in the Yellowstone
Park, which is made the chief feature of their enter :
tainment in that part of the country-
As enjoyment is heightened by contrast, they will
be abundantly prepared for the pleasures of Yellow
stone natural scenery by the strenuous life they must
pass in California. The numerous functions, receptions,
dedications, unveilings, anniversaries, dinners, ! ban
quets, presentations, launchings, speeches, addresses,
iiitroductions, greetings, processions, -pageants, pa
rades and pleasures arranged for them here will make
tlÂ«e change to a contact with nature and imposing
scenery most grateful and agreeable.
Perhaps it would have been better to have had
more variety in the California programme. A chance
to see the Yosemite Valley at its best has been over
looked. Around the valley "are the Government's
first and. greatest timber reservations, which require
far more attention than they get. To have an oppor
tunity to see these forests would have pleased the
Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior, for they
both have official, relations to the materiaL questions
which are among the reasons for the forest reserve
policy. - ..-"....
The President has vjrited the Yosemite, but. the
members of his Cabinet .have, not seen that grea:
natural wonder.
We are impressed tliat it would have been more
agreeable to. the visitors and more beneficial to the
State to have given them more time to see rural
an.- natural California. What part of the State is
artificial has features in common with the artificial
everywhere, while what is natural here is not com
mon, but individual, as it is grand and charming.
Seen in retrospect, back along the line followed by'
the existing programme, California will seem like a
long line of tables spread with food, a procession of
dress suits, a medley of "Dixie" 'and "Yankee
Doodle," a long-dra-ATi-out speech of welcome and
farewell, all framed in fatigue and indigestion.
By contrast Montana will be a delightful perspective
of waterfalls, bosky dells, meadow reaches, clear
streams, brown-nosed wapiti and moose and shuffling
bears made tame by protection from the hunter.
'As all that man can do by art must be limited by
the resources which are provided by nature, perhaps
a more symmetrical conception of California would
have been made possible by giving a better chance to
sec that which is natural:
Our northern neighbors in the ambitious States oft
Oregon, Washington ?nd Montana seem to realize
this more fully than we have, and they put less stress
on formalities and functions, Jess on the proud dis
play of leading citizens, and more upon making an
impression by giving a chance to their natural scenery
zaA resources.
They will have an easier time, for there is neither
vanity nor vexation of spirit in ; nature. She has no
uncertain code of etiquette arfd no disputes as to
p:ecede'nc"eand' place, reither "does she want an of
fice or seek to influence legislation! Therefore na
ture is such a restful person to meet on a trip like
this- r
THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT.
'That the sum of $500,006,000 demanded from China
by the powers is excessive to" the extent of being ex
tcrtion is known'to all the world. JIf the demand is to
be enforced it should, be done, frankly, in the name
of conquest and no further attempt should be made to
keep up the mockery of a High, Court of Nations to
arbitrate international, disputes. = An [hypocrisy which
deceives nobody is something like an insult to intel
ligence,- and as, . affaics.are.no w goingjijrr'.the field of
international politics the continued /existence of: the
tribunal called into being by the Peace Conference at
The -Hague merely serves Â¦ to excite, derision and in
jures rather than advances the cause-of arbitration.
Such, being the case the High Court- of Nations
stands before the world ?s a representative of imperial
hypocrisy. It can have no other signification than
that. Should it _ ever assemble- the grave dignitaries
who compose it could hardly refrain from laughing
,in. the faces of one cnother. The members would
doubtless be treated with respect by. the community in
whose city they met, for all of, "them are men of such
personal merit as. to command respect, but no one
could have respect for, them as a court. Their meet
ing"would be but a banquet and a. vanity, and would
hardly count for more in the -history of civilization
than a masquerade at q,ome imperial palace arranged
for the entertainment of a visiting monarch.
It happens that there is now, before the world an
international question of the utmost importance, and
therefore one that might rightly engage the attention
of the High Court.*. The powers .have disagreed con
cerning the extent of the penalty to be imposed upon
China by reason of wrongs, done during the Boxer
insurrection. Six of the- powers, Germany, Austria,
Italy, ; Spain, Belgium and Holland, are in favor of
demanding an enormous indemnity. The United
States and Great Britain are opposed to such a de
mand, while Russia, and France have not as yet de
clared themselves. The 'situation presents exactly the
sor* of issue thatthe High-Court could properly deal
with. It is not a question between any of the powers
and China; it is'a question between two parties
among the powers themselves, and consequently
there could be no loss of dignity v should the' matter
be referred to the tribunal in which all are repre
sented.
Of course the question will never go to the High
Court. The powers prefer to settle it out of, court.
Each will insist upon the right to exact what indem
nity it chooses from the Chinese and will not leave
the subject to arbitration even though the Chinese
are to have no representative on the boat d of arbitra
tion;
\ ~ Nations." All the great powers of the earth
have representatives in th e. court, and t each member
is a, man of the first rank as a statesman, diplomatist
or judge. Having formed such a court it would seem
to be the proper thing for the powers to now show
their .willingness to make noble use of -it. There
is no reason why a tribunal bearing such an august
title should be ignored by the very authorities that
created it. ' .

vocates of municipal ownership of public service in
dustries, and city governments and the corporations
upon which they' propose the bestowmertf of franchises
such as those. from which he gleaned his millions have
come in for his unsparing denunciation.
In this propaganda he has not hesitated to quote
his own case as an example,-rior to declare that he
took advantage of the s-ituation to get hold of all the
valuable franchises he could operate.
This holding with the hare ' and running with the
hounds has given him a great vogue with nearly every
class, of fad.hunters in' the country. He is intellec
tually very bright and alert, with a rather charming
personality and manners, and of ready and interesting

cacy of municipal ownership endears him to the pus'n

all public utilities are in public ownership and politi
cal control. On the other hand the theorists who
think that under public ownership street cars, will back
up" to every man's door like an opinibus, and that the
mere transfer of control to the public will sweeten
bod water and make clean that which is muddy ; and
that destruction of private property in land will dress
Â¦the ragged in gorgeous raiment, hail him as the evan

MORE FREAK CANDIDATES:
Z To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In
an editorial appearing inr Â« The iCall on
March 16 of this year you say "the feeling
in favor of municipal ownership has long
been, cherished "in the United States, Taut
has never gained any Impetus from ex
amples of that policy in this country.
City ownership of water supply in Boston,
New.Tork and Philadelphia has existed
from the early appearance of the neces
sity for a large supply in those cities.
But apparently neither in the quality of
the supply furnished nor in. the economy
of its storage, conduit and distribution has
it afforded a quotable example. | So the
earnest advocates of the system resort to
foreign Instances of its institution."
In another editorial, on April 3, you
again attack tbe principle of public own
ership. You say; "but as in Europe every
instance of municipal ownership and re
duction in-ratea has been accompanied by
a larger reduction in wages, it is entirely
proper to inquire whether in this country
tnei-e will be any exception. Before ex
periments on a large scale are undertaken
It Is well to know whether public owner
ship, to S realize the expectations of the
economists, must result in lower wages
for the labor employed. â¢ â¢ â¢ :' People
are drawn to the support of public owner
ship by the belief that it will reduce the
earnings of capital. But if it reduce also
the earnings of labor, as a public_economy
it- will be'a failure."
Â¦The warning conveyed by The Call" is
that public ownership is experimental,
that it has never been tried successfully
on a large scale in the United States, and
that when It shall have been so tried the,
Tvages of labor will be materially reduced.
The history of municipal ownership In
the United States does not support the
position t)f The Call. Municipal ownership
of water works is now the rule in .the
United States.' Instead ,of being in the
experimental stage it has been well sea
soned by long and successful experience.
The water supplied is Cheaper than that
supplied by private corporations; the
wages 'of laborers are generally higher in
municipal enterprises than in those con
trolled by private capital; the price of the
service rendered is uniformly less than in
privately controlled- corporations, and,
lastly, the city of New York, which . is
quoted by The Call as an example against
the policy of municipal ownership, is the
strongest and most conclusive example of
the success of municipal ownership found
in. the United States, and perhaps in the
world. :Â¦:-Â¦Â¦ ' ; Â¦ .Â¦- - - Â¦
Of the fifty largest cities in the United
States only nine have water works under
private control. Those cities are San
Francisco, ]Vew Orleans." Omaha,' Denver,
Indianapolis, New Haven, . Paterson,
Scranton i and Â¦ Memphis. Fortv-one to
nine is the Judgment of the American peo
ple in favor of municipal, ownership of
water Â¦ supplies ( if, the experience, of the
large cities Is conclusive. .
In this rega'rd the Merchants' Associa
tion of New York savs: "The experience
of other municlualities In the United
States as well as in ether countries shows
an almost continuous tendency to substi
tute publicly * owned -water svstems for
private, a tendency so uersistent and so
universal and of such constantly increas
ing force that the wisdom, in the public
interest, of the policy of municipal owner
ship and control ' of - water supply would
seem established . by abundant experi
ence.. â¢â¢ Â¦ ' . Â¦ Â¦â¢ . â¢ " Â¦.--Â¦â¢.
"In 1800' there were sixteen plants In op
eration in the United States, of which fif
teen were private and one' public. Since
that time fourteen cf the fifteen have
become public. ' Â¦ . Â¦
"At the close of 1896 there were In thd
United States 3196 water works. Of these
1690 were under public control, 14S9 under
private control, 12 were under 1oint con
trol and of 5 the ownership was unknown;
in other words, in 1800 6.3 per cent wera
public, 93.7 per cent were private. In 1896
53;2 per cent were public, 46.5 per cent
were private."â "The Water Supply of the
City of New York," published by the Mer
chants' Association of I\ew York, page 20.
The advocates of municipal ownership
of water supplies rest firmly on the ex
perience of American -cities. We who ad
vocate it in San Francisco point to the ex
perience of other cities *>.3 the justification
for our position. What all other Ameri
can cities are doing is surely wise for us
to do. . ". -. â¢â¢ â¢ ; Â¦ â¢
The next point is that -water suppliedrby
cities ; is cheaper. than that supplied by
private corporations. Individual instances
prove . nothing, but tho ! average of all
American cities does. The merchants of
New York say on this point: "The cost to
the consumer is almost always less under
public than under private, ownership. The
average cost per family .throughout the
United States is, for public, $21 55; for pri
vate,'. $30 82. .That is, privately supplied
water costs about 40 per cent more than
that supplied -by municipalities."â "The
Water Supply of the City of New York,"
page 21. Â¦'-
It is the same with electric lighting.
AVhile there are sorpe instances of dismal
failure, ' the average cost of lighting is
from 10 to 15 cer cent less under public
than under private ownership in the
United States. City Engineer Grunsky
has recently filed elaborate plans- for
lighting the city of San Francisco with
electricity. At the present time we are
paying 35 and 39% cents per arc lamn per
night, according to location.' but if the
city owned its own plant the cost would
be only 24' cents "per night. The plant
would also furnish power to run the city
elevators, the city sewage pumps and the
Geary-street railroad.
Take the experience of Chicago. City
Electrician Elliot, in a recent interview in
the Chicago News, said: "The feasibility
of municipal ownership is nowhere better
demonstrated than in Chicago". There are
larger â¢ municipal plants', abroad j selling
products to citizens, but nowhere In the
world is there a street-lighting plant of
such dimensions owned ,by a municipality.
Thirteen years ago it was established to
serve 105 lights. To-day 4300 arc lights are
being operated within a territory of sixty
six square miles, at a saving to the city" of
$40 a year on each light, j The plant Is worth
$1,350,000â a larse amount when one con
siders that by the end of the year the
plant will have paid for itself. So, you
see, Chicago leads â¢ the world in one de
partment of municipal ownership." â¢
In regard to the wages of laborers in
municipal enterprises,, the fourteenth an
nual report of the. United States Commis
sioner of Labor is authoritative. I quote
from a review ot this report appearing in
"California Municipalities" for October,
1900, at page 73: '.:
'.'Water rWorksâ The general conclusions
may be stated to be:
"Municipal plants pay smaller salaries.
"Municipal plants pay higher.wages.
-"Municipal plants produce more cheaply.
.""Municipal plants sell water cheaper.
"Ga"? Worksâ The conclusions on the sub
ject of: gas works are similar, to those on
water works. .
','Electric Lighting â The." conclusions
from these tables are: : ,.
"Municipal plants expend much less in
salarleg. -" <=-.- Â¦-- -
"Municipal plants expend a little Jess in
wages. , ; . .
' -"Municipal plants charge less for lights
to private users.
. "Municipal plants furnish their own ser
vice for less than do private plants."
, The statistics compiled by the Commis-'
sioner prove that the municipal ownership
of water and gas works results in in
creased wages to labor. .while the munici-'
pal ownership of electric plants results in
slightly less wages to labor. ' Yim are
therefore. right in regard to the nfunicipal
ownership' of electric enterprises, but that
need not -affect us - in San Francisco, for
the policy of the city government has al
ways â¢ been in 'favor of the -workingman
and the' charter provides that $2 a day
shall be the minimum wages -or laborers.
The last point I : desire to make is that
the city of New. York, popularly supposed
to be the worst governed city in the
United 'States, is a shining example of the
success, of j municipal ownership of water.
New York is par excellence a boss-ridden
city, where machine. politics are the only
politics known,': and where vice flourishes
like a green bay tree. The recent report
of j the Vice Committee appointed to in
vestigate ;the conditions under which vice
is Drotected in New York shows that over
$3,500,000 is - paid, every year by the law
breakers of New .York for immunity from
arrest and prosecution. ; If municipal own
ership should. fail anywhere it should fail
in New'; York, and the failure should De
complete and damning. â¢ , -

- New, York â¢ has v always Â¦ owned Its own

that a water famine Is a serious and dis

IX.â The Pace That Kills.
There .used to be an old and learned
professor in Bellevue Hospital, New York,
who was wont to say that the two great
causes for the'downfall of man were whis
ky and * women. This was the Bellevue
point of view.- For, mind you. Bellevue is
situated east of First avenue and runs full
to the river front. Here, close by the
swirling waters of the East River, are
the pavilion, for the insane, the alcoholic
ward and the morgue." Here is the end
of the pace that kills. Sometimes It is
the shrieking maniac in the pavilion for
the insane; sometimes the frenzied drunk
ard in the alcoholic ward,' and "sometimes
the bloated face ami the swollen body of
the unknown 'lead floating with the tide.
But always the long and narrow compart
ment under the vaulted , dome of the
morgue, . the city's great safe deposit of
the dead. C , * , *
Over, in Fifth avenue they say it is wine
and women. But in First avenue it is
whisky and women. Some' of the victims
have gone^both courses." They have had
their wine and women In Fifth avenue
and their whisky and women in First ave
nue. By nd possibility, however, did any
man going the pace that kills take the
First avenue course * and follow it wltn
the Fifth avenue course. The descent
from Delmonico's and the "Waldorf-Asto
ria to the Olive Tree Inn and the Munici
pal Lodging-house for Homeless Hen is
always easy and often quick, but there is
-no ascent In the pace that kills.
One Who Had Gone the Pace.
One day I went into the alcoholic ward
in Bellevue Hospital and saw there a
woman whom I had known when men
courted her as an acknowledged belle in
the highest society and whom the world
had subsequently accepted as an actress
of talent on the metropolitan stage. She
was suffering from an aggravated case of
what First avenue . calls "the jimmies."
From sparkling wine at diplomatic din
ners in the nation's capital to late sup
pers in Broadway in New York. City, to
habitual drunkenness, â¢ to consequent Im
moral recklessness, to opium, s to a place
in the alcoholic ward, a charge upon the
city's charity, were the successive evolu
tions of her pace. that killed.
There she lay, Â¦ a . shattered wreck; her
beauty gone, her keen Intellectuality
eclipsed, and all the charms that had
brought men to her feet vanished. Just
the ugly -hull ot a woman whose mind was
besotted and whose soul was dead. Every
effort was made to help her, and she final
ly recovered sufficiently to go out of the
hospital. But Jt was only to come back
again,' drunker, if possible, more depraved
and more hopeless than ever. She had
gone the pace that kills. She had fallen at
the end, borne down by the inevitable re
sult.
Waiting for the Inevitable Result.
There is always somebody on Fifth ave
nue attracting the attention of the town
by exploits in fast living. There is money
galore and feasting and frolic and the
high-headed self-pride in the hallucination
that the pace can be gone without the
killing. The well-trained habitues of Del
monico's, who always keep the curb on,
raise their eyebrows in temporary inter
est. Â¦ The motley crowd at the Waldorf-
Astoria stares as at another exhibit of the
circus. The painted frequenters of the
upper Broadway restaurants chatter and
gossip over their midnight suppers about
the star. But Bellevue waits in silence.
It knows nothing . of what Is doing on
Fifth avenue or Broadway. It hears noth
ing: of the feasts, the frolics or the follies.
It cares nothing for the wine or the wom
en or the song. It .Just, wafts, certain in
â¢the end it will get ,what:.is left after
Fifth' avenue and -'all-* 'the intermediate
steps between that aristocratic thorough
fare and First avenue have been gone
over by the victim of the pace that kills.
And there is usually nothing left but a
dead body, or a dead mind in a diseased
body. .,-
The pace that kills, however, does not
always begin on Fifth avenue. It some
times starts on the Bowery and .never
reaches higher uptown than Twenty-sixth
street and the East River. It sometimes
starts on the far east side or the far -west
side, and the police patrol wagon or the
Bellevue ambulance comes after its victim
before he or she has ever reached the
great backbone of- the city.
â¢ Nor does- the pace always begin with
wine. It sometimes, starts with whisky,
and there is a tradition in Bellevue that
First avenue whisky is far quicker and
more deadly in its action than Fffth-ave
nue wine. But wherever It may start, and
with whatever it, may start, whisky and
woman appear somewhere in the course.
And whisky outlasts everything else
among the death-dealing agencies that
produce mental, moral and physical dis
integration. " . -
A Paca Open to All Comers.
The weaknesses of human nature are
confined to no class of men. Wealth is
not necessary. for the pace that kills and
poverty is no .bar to it. Knowledge is not
a'preventive and Ignorance is. only an ac
celeration. Health sometimes prompts it
and disease is often its excuse. Gentle
Â« birth and careful training only stimulate
it In some instances, while common origin
and coarse breeding are accepted by it as
welcome variation. In the parlance of the
race trackâ it "plays no favorites." The
race is open to all comers,' and no-ques
tion is raised as to pedigree, age or previ
ous performance.' The nominator can make
his own regulations. He can go the long
course 'or the short course.-over the flat or
the hurdles, as he chooses. The only con
dition Imposed is that he shall keep at it,
and in the end the prize shall be his. For
to every one that goes the pace that kills
and keeps at it there is a prjze â the prize
of shame, disgrace, demoralization, death.
There is no need of preaching about it.
Tor centuries good men have inveighed
against it from- the pulpit and the ros-
trum. Learned scientists _ have written
endless books against It. Saintly womert
have uttered their most devout prayers
against it. And yet It goes on and will go
Â£L There Is a germ of degeneracy Inman
kind-that develops under all conditions,
and for which no remedy has ever been
found or can be found, Â«Â« development
is sometimes slow and sometimes fast. But
unless a check is put on It. in Its early
stapes the end Is always the same-tha
madhouse or the morgue. Â¦ Â¦
Gathering tlio Ghastly Harvest.
The department of public charities of
the city of New York Is the dumping
ground of the refuse humanity of the sec
ond greatest city In the world. Here are
deposited those creatures whom no other
agency will eare for.. The sick, the pau
per, the inebriate, the idiot, the epileptic,
the paralytic, the insane. Hundreds of
these come every day. The gate of the
public charities is always open. -and no ono
its refused. Each day. too. Is gathered the
city's dead. From the rivers, from se
cluded corners of the parks, from llttla
rooms In obscure hotels and from meager
apartments of poor tenements are gath
ered day after dtiy those to whom life was
not worth living 'or whose end came in
such poverty that their only chance cC
interment was the potter's field.
It Is grewsome fruit, and, lying there
one above the other in the compartments
of tha_jnorgue, each corpse Is the dumb
witness of some life tragedy, sonfe driv
ing on to death from which In the end
there was no escape. If one were to tako
from this granary of the dead individual
cases and trace them through all the steps
that brought them to the morgue, ona
would find that directly or indirectly the
end was due to the pace that kills. The
same is true of New York city's 10.000 in
sane people and of its countless feeble
minded idiots and epileptics. - Somewnero
at some time somebody has gone the pace
that kills, and not only has plunged him
self into destruction, but has carried oth
ers with him or has left seeds of dissipa
tion that have'sprung up after him. -
I never go through the morgue but that
I feel that abo^e its door should be writ
ten: -
f THE WAGES OF- SIN IS DEATH. T
I never visit the Idiots, the feeble
minded, the epileptic and the crippled
children in my department but that I am
reminded that the sins of the father shall
be visited UDon the child. I never see
decent old women, come weeping to the
alirhouse but that I am sure there is a
relentless fate that mixes up the lives of
men and makes the innocent suffer with
the guilty.
The Hope" of Fetter Things.
But while the germ of degeneracy may
not be eradicated or even regulated, there
is no doubt In my mind that its effect can
be minimized and that through the active
agencies now at work it is being mini
mized. Â¦ There is always the fool to be
parted from his money and there is al
ways that impetuosity of temperament
that must be < periodically appeased
whether it manifests Itself in drink or
gambling or any other form of dissipa
tion. . But statistics will show, I believe,
that urban peoples are better to-day th;Â».n
at any other period in the world's history.
The pace that kills is a vice that cornea
with civilization and its accumulation ol
wealth and its prevalence of poverty; foi,
as the fortunes of a few men increasa
the fortunes of many men decrease, ami
the fool without money goes the pace
quite as disastrously to himself as the
fool with money. Some men go It because
they are rich and some because they are
poor, some because they are well and
some because they are sick, some because
they are happy and some because they
are. unhappy. Their attitude 13 much, the
same, as that of the man who drank In.
cold weather .to keep himself warm and
in -warm weather to keep himself cool.
As I said before, the germ of degen
eracy works In all kinds o* people and un
der all kinds of conditions. But with the
advance of civilization there has come a
conviction on the part of students of
municipal government that !n municipal
government attention Is given rather to
effect than cause. New. York City spends
princely sums of money in taking care of
criminals and paupers. It shouldpay more
attentitm to the causes of crime and pov
erty. It is better to remove the cause of ill
ness than to take care of a person suffer
ing from an illnesa as the effect of that
cause. It is better to prevent a man from
becoming a criminal than to lock him up
after he has committed a crime.
To Improve Hsalth and Morals.
Municipal government should not only
remtve temptation as far aa possible from
the weak, but it should work for clean
environment of Its people. It should re
form the dwellings of its poor. It should
regulate it3 tenements, as well as ita
{rambling houses and dens of vice. Not
that the morals of the tenement are nat
urally worse than the morals of the man
sion, but that in an overcrowded tenement
there are more dark places in which crime
and filth can find a foothold than in the
mansion. Give all the people light and
air and sunshine and their morals will im
prove with their health. Crime hates the
light. Â» With cleaner places to live In and
cleaner environment for all the people
there would be lesa use for hospitals and
prisons. The pace that kills would st!!l
continue, but to the wheels of the chariot
of the fool .that goes it there would be
chained fewer victims and there wouM
also be fewer fools to emulate his ex
ample.
The f river must still give up its dÂ»nn
the Inebriate and the madman must stili

First avenue whisky rauat still be drunk-

TWO EASTERN CROOKS WELL
KNOWN TO THE POLICE
THROUGHOUT COUNTRY.
The Government is represented by
United States Attorney Woodworth, who
has advanced the theory that the identi
fication papers taken to China by the
parents of Fong Wa Due were. stolen or
sold, and that the applicant has been sub
stituted for the boy who left here four
years ago.
The case was accordingly postponed In
the first day's examination, a week, ago
James and John Brownlee, who were ac
quainted with the real Fong Wa Due
swore that they were not sure whether
the applicant was he or not, while Snerift
Savage and J. Wieneger testified posi
tively that the applicant was the real
Fong. Two life-sized bust photographs
one of the applicant and the other of the
real Fongâ were submitted to the inspec
tion of the Judse.
As the evidence Against the application
of the boy to land began to pile up Attor
ney Worley, who appeared for Fong, be
gan to grow more and more indignant.
ttlB cup was full when Pong Shing of
Vallejo testified that Mr. Worley's clfent
was not the Fong Wa Due, his young rel
ative, whom he had seen every day In
Vallejo prior to his departure for China,
but his cup of woe spilled over when Mrs.
Charles Orayson and Mrs. Minnie Ford
swore that the applicant was not the
Fong Wa Due whom they had taught in
the Chinese Mission School at Vallejo,
and the lawyer very excitedly announced
that he would prove to the satisfaction
of the court that a conspiracy existed to
keep the boy out of the United States.
"I will give you every opportunity to
prove the existence of a conspiracy," said
Judge Heacock. "Do you mean to say
that you propose to show that these ladies
here are parties to that conspiracy?"
"That's what I mean," replied the law
yer confidently.
"Then," said the Judge, "I will continue
this case until next Wednesday to allow
you an opportunitly of proving your as
sertion."
: A lively scene was enacted In United
States Court Commissioner Heacock's
char^bers yesterday during the habeas
corpus proceedings in the matter of the
application of Fong "Wa Due to land.
Fong is 11 years old and says- that he
was born In Vallejo and that he went to
China with his parents four years ago.

The Oil Refineries.
The move of the oil companies In Shasta
County to have the lands upon which op
erations are proceeding withdrawn from
homestead entry has met with favorable
response from the General Land Office.
It has been decided to form a Shasta
County petroleum miners' association for
mutual protection. Directors , from the
several companies have been" appointed as
a committee on permanerft organization.
The Redding Searchlight" says that the
application to have the lands withdrawn
was made to head off scrippers, and adds
"It was- suggested that a rifle corps be
kept ready to take the lleld if oil is struck
and influence jumpers not to jump."
The Napa Journal reports that a
stratum of oil sand has been struck in a
well In Capelle Valley, on the Pierrat
place. An oil seepage has also been dis
covered in another part of the valley. The
oil strike was brought about by Mr..Pier
rat and the Johnson brothers, who were
working with a small well-boring appa
ratus.
"What well In the local field Is the most pro
ductive Is largely a matter of opinion, but
there 1s no question that the Rlley hole out in
the middle western extension is the deepest yet
drilled In home territory. The Rlley well was
begun several- months ago on the west Elde of
Western avenue, a little south of the Pellle-
Blcr Tract. It was started with 11%-lnch cas
ing and has since been sÂ»nt in 1680 feet. With
in a few feet of the bottom the large-sized
casing has been used. Although no oil streak
ha* been found, the showing since the 1500
foot level has been a light shale in which
traces of oil have appeared. In the first 1000
feet seme trouble was caused by water sand
but since that depth the hole has been free.
It Is the intention of W. G. Riley, the owner,
to send the drill In 2000 feet. If oil Is not en
countered before. Should a strike of note, be
made the find will bo one of the most, signifi
cant credited to the home field in many
months, as It will open up a new line cf de
velopment.
The Los. Angeles Times says:
Drilling a Deep Well.
The Crocker-Huffman Company Is about
to drill for oil on company land a few
miles southwest from Merced. The mate
rial for the derrick Is on the spot. Some
years ago gas was discovered to be Issu
ing from the ground. The well will be
placed near, the gas leakage.
The shipments from the Kern River dis
trict last month, according to figures fur
nished by the railways to the Bakersfleld
Callfornian, amounted to 1290 carloads, or
193,500 barrels, being at the average rate
of 6250 barrels of oil per day. "It has
heretofore been estimated," says the Call
fornian, "that the wells now completed in
the district can deliver 15,000 barrels daily,
but a large operator has made figures
showing the output to be 30,000 barrels. If
the railroads fulfill their promises It will
not be long before there will be ample
shipping facilities, and then the district's
production can be measured at its full ca
pacity. As the conditions now are it ap
pears that the railroads are able to han
dle only about one-fifth of the yield were
all the wells producing." .
Seek Second Sommerland.
Prospectors are searching for oil on the
beach Just west of Port Los Angeles, in
the immediate vicinity of the town of
Ventura. The* > Ventura Free Press says
that there are numerous spots in that lo
cality where the gas has been lighted and
remained burning for some time. There
are also oil springs, seepages, deposits of
brea and beds of gilsonite and asphaltum
In Innumerable places. The prospectors
hope to find a second Summerland ocean
oil field.
Henry Ach says ihe oil producers" will
reach a final conclusion as to their course
of action within a fortnight. The general
committee will meet Soon again and begin
the work of putting t;:to the best shapo
possible the plan that they receive In- the
shape of recommendations from the sub
committee.
The deliberations of the oil men still
form the most Interesting theme connect
ed with the oil industry In California.
Since the conferenca In the Palace Hote!
the work of trying: to get all producers to
gether In some sort of an agreement that
will be a measure of mutual protection
has been progressing-. The sub-committee
that was appointed to prepare a plan to
submit to the general committee has prac
tically completed It's work. Now the mem
bers are waiting 1 to hear from oil produc
ers suggestions as may be offered. The
facts are so. well known and have been
eo thoroughly discussed by the producers
that It Is not probable there will be
any necessity for a radical departure from
the conclusions of the sub-committee, al
though there may be changes In some,/ of
the details. A corporation will be formed,
the capital stock of v:hich '1b not yet de
cided upon. The mail purpose. is to regu
late the price and distribution of oil.
In addition to the producing companies
there are many others that are drilling or
getting ready to drill that are equally
concerned. It Is unquestionably true that
the Interest In the outcome of the pending

That the meetings of the Board of Edu

unplf-asant Incident was again demon
strated yesterday when President Kln
ca'd took occasion to administer a severe
rebuke to Deputy Superintendent of
Schools Kingsbury. The trouble arose
over the taking under advisement of a
ref-olution presented by Superintendent
Wcte-ter oesignating the subjects in
which the City Board of Examination
may recommend applicants for social
certificates in accordance with a Dill en

During the recess of the board Kings

The board also took under advisement
the petition of taxpayers along the ocean
beach, between B street and the Ocean
Hcuse, that a school be provided for their
chi'.dren south of Golden Gate Park. Mrs.
Thomas McMulhn addressed the board in

in this city until the arrival of President
McKinley and his party and then ply
their "graft." Seeing a large crowd in

Sreen and his companion proceeded to
"take off a few stones," as Merrill ex

the Klondike millionaire, happened to be
in the crowd. He wore a valuable dia
mond stud in his shirt bosom. Green pur
posely stepped on his foot and while Berry
Ftaried to argue with him on what he
termed His "Impertinence," Merrill re
lieved him cf the diamond. Berry did not
know of his loss until Detectives Hammill

them under arrest. They were accom

CHICAGO. April 17.â Wheat traders ' kept
their eyes on the weather map and their ears
open to tidings of the operations of the'Hes
sian fly. As to climatic conditions, there
seemed to be little change, * although ! the re
ports from time to time seemed to indicate
otherwise. Before trading began it was claim
ed that the . frost predicted j for Kansas j had
appeared during the night, . and this, combined
with the fact " that receipts were ' light and
cables at least no easier than could be ac
counted for by the course of the market on
this side yesterday, somewhat alarmed shorts
and the May option having opened %c higher
at 70?4c, touched 70%c almost at the same In
stant, rallied to 70%c during the first' hour.
â¢Thei frosts which had been so' much dreaded,
however, were scarcely mentioned In tele
grams from Kansas, and while the weather
was unseasonably coM In the spring wheat
States, it was thought wheat was not suffi
ciently advanced - to â¢ suffer. May eased off Â¦ to
70%c on moderate selling, rallied to 7O?s<S"71e
on reports of damage by Hessian i fly, and
closed steady %o over yesterday at 70*ic
Corn was firmly held, but no attempt was
made to push prices unduly upward, although
receipts were small and the weather unsea
sonable. May closed unchanged at 44Uc.
May. oats were strong all day, closing Ho
higher at 25%c. Considerable changing to July
was noticeable.
In the provisions pit pork was neglected and
the rest of the list quiet. The range was
narrow. July pork closed 2Vic higher, lard

The Wall Street Outlook.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"It is very difficult to fix on any period at
which the current boom may be expected to
end its couice. It is altogether exceptional as
to its causes. Its main stimulus centers In its
connection with the great movement of indus
trial consolidation. The conversion of some
$2,OC0.CO0,OC0 of corporate capital into a >Â«nuch
smaller number of corporations with approx
imately {5.000,000,000 of nominal capital â of
which $3.000,0<50,000 is common stock, based
mainly upon good willâ amounts to a stupen
dous inflation, which has deranged the whole
basis r-T investment values. The inflation of
fueh an enormous aggregate of the productive
capital of the country has the natural effect
of inflating the market value of other forms
of investment, among the first of which come
railroad F?curlties. It is assumed that If a
process of financial reconstruction can be made
to warrant a doubling of the capital of our
manufactures then an amalgamation of our
railroads, our mines, our oil wells, and our
steamship lines warrants a similar expansion
in the market value of the securities repre
senting those classes of investments, and thus
the inflation has swiftly spread over every
class of securities that finds its market in
Wall street. â¢
"For the time beins there is some basis for
this immense expansion in the extraordinary
run of national prosperity (which has found
â¢ome parallel In the commercial activity of
ether countries), but which, however, is not
to be reckoned upon us a permanency. The
expansion of our industrial capitalizations is
kept up with such persistency and on such a
vast poale. it is sanctioned by such an array
of influential names rusd is underwritten by
financiers of such great potency, that specu
lation knows neither cautior. nor limits. There
seems to be nÂ» end to the creation of new
deals, and each successive one adds new oil
to the flame of excitement. Speculators reason
that the larger the number of schemes the
larpcr the amount af capital committed to
their support, and conclude that the greater
the magnitude of the movement the broader
the basis of its stability and endurance. And
ctrtainly, bo long as new schemes are forth
coming, launched under influential auspices
and resulting in successful consummations, we
may calculate u^cn the maintenance of a san
guine market and j>o>mI>1>- even still higher
prices than have yet lK-en touched. In spite,
therefore, of the occasion spasms of caution
end even a'arm which show themselves in sud
den and very inrg-e liquidations, there are still
encuph new buyers to start upward reactions
Â¦nd keep up the steam, and few seem to have
a decided conviction <:hat the consummation of
the boom is yet close at hand.
â¢"All this means, however, that the danger
is increasing at every tiep. Every movement
in Fuc-h a direction piles up the more false
construction to be unelurie. The higher prices
are pushed above the normal level the . lower
will be the fall below lt. The bulwark of past
profits may to-day ins-plre the utmost con
fidence, but when the :mpetus of the final llqui
dization gets on full headway the reaction is
likely to surpass many of the previous ad
justments of Wall Eti-e-.t booms. At the mo
ment tfle situation is probably inopportune for
the promoters of the great Industrial schemes
to permit any encouragement of a realizing
policy. When that stage arrives the outside
innrvBts will soon discover their position and
the return of the market to its normal level
is not likely to be a slow process."

bull leaders are manifestly perplexed over
what Is to take the place of the Burlington
deal as an effective influence In fomenting
speculation when the matter Is finally dis
posed ct. To-day's developments did . not
seem to cause doubt of the practical consum
mation of the plan and in fact heavy profit
taking was to be looked for even had the
matter been announced. The threatened strike
of iron and steel workers was a continued in
fluence toward depression and United States
Steel stocks were heavy all day, ruling a frac
tion under yesterday throughout. The move
ment of the market was principally due ' to
technical causes. The more favorable money
. conditions were Ignored. . The , sterling ex
change market was rather soft/ notwithstand
ing the increased supply here of loanable
i funds, so that the outflow of gold is pretty
i certainly deferred ' beyond this week. I The :
range of prices during the day was extremely
wide, reaching from 2 to 4 points in nearly
all of the most active stocks.
The bond. market continued active, but the
price movement was irregular. Total sales,
par value, $5,305,000. United States old 4s reg

CLOSING.
Business on the Stock . Exchange here con
tinued'firm on a restricted scale to-day, though
the tone was firm. In the American depart
ment trading began heavy, with many signs
of nervousness. The bulges in Erie and North
ern Pacific had excited some anxiety and busi
ness remained dull until In the afternoon. . In
deed, almost nothing was done until the open
ing in New York, and then the trading be
came ' wildly erratic.' Northern Paclfica^ and
Eries went down, [rallied, dipped again "and
recovered. The market seemed to lack nerve,
but Eries. Readings and Southern Railways
are- confidently tipped, for a further rise, the
Readings because they have not participated
proportionately in the advance of. the other
coalers. The Continent bought Missouri Paci
fic,. Kansas Pacific and 'Mexican National.
The bank has bought Â£445,000 in bars. The
Government is disbursing freely to prepare the
market for a war loan. It is improbable that
the bank rate will be reduced, to-morrow, but
it may be fixed at 3% per cent next week.-

The Â¦ rales for the week In Boston amounted
to 3.4S3.000 pounds domestic and 625,000 pounds
foreign, making a total. of 4,108,000, against a
total of.-3.608,000 for the previous week, and a
total of 2,432,000 for the corresponding week
last year. The sales since January \ amount
to 72.S42.900 pounds, . against 49.S59.900 pounds
for the corresponding time last year.
There is. if anything, a little more of a dis
position to buy than was noted a week ago,
but it is a between seasons period with the
mills, initial orders for heavyweights being
practically, completed and it being too early
for the duplicate orders to set in.- Finer wools
are relatively stroncer than medium and low
wools, and the inquiry seems to be run
ntnjr more to the finer Â¦ sorts than formerly.
The tone of the market is quite' firm, although
it is as yet impossible to secure better prices
for wools. There have been some Nevada
wools purchased for Eastern account.
There has been a fair, steady trade in prog
sress since our last review, mostly with . the
medium-Sized mills. The '. largest consumers
have done very little and very few sales of any
magnitude are reported. .The aggregate of the
takings of the smaller purchases, however,
foots ud a fair-sized total, exceeding 4,000,000
pounds. Â¦ . . â¢
BOSTON. April 17.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say of the wool trade.to
morrow:
Boston Wool Market.
NEW YORK. April 17.â The opening was
steady, .witn prices unchanged to 2 points
lower. From that level there was a gradual
Improvement all along the line, with July
leading the advance. Then came a reaction of
6 points . and a lull in the outside demand.
The market closed steady at a net advance of
6@10 points. Â¦ ---->:.'Â¦ Â¦-<
New York Cotton Market.
Copper in London declined 15s and experi
enced a weak undertone, with spot closing at
Â£70 3s 9d and futures Â£70 12s. Here, however,
the market was more or less nominal' at un
changed prices.- Exports of copper are ex
tremely small, amounting for the first hilf of
April to only 2500 tons, against a total of 12,475
lor April a year ago. This factor was attrib
uted to a lack of European demand, where con
sumption has fallen off materially.' A little
steadier feeling prevailed In spelter, owing to
a light local Inquiry, and prices at the close
were 2V6 points higher than yesterday, with the
tone firm. A rise of 7s 6d abroad to Â£16 13s
helped the steadiness. Lead remains Inactive
and unchanged at $4 37%. Domestic iron mar
kets ruled quiet but about steady at unchanged
prices. ...
NEW YORK. April 17.â The metal market,
ci! "the whole, â was ; somewhat better Ic day.
Advanced quotations were reported for tin and
spelter, with news from abroad indicating gen
oral firmness. Tin in local circles rose about
25 points in sympathy with the advance for
that metal in London, said to be the result of
American speculative dealings, despite the fact
that the : statistical outlook remains bearish.
The close here 'was firmer Â»t $26 70. wnll.; at
London closing prices were Â£117 12s 6d on spot
and. Â£115 5s for futures. A fair businesi was
c'one* In both markets.

JUDGE HUNT ORDERS
MRS. REEVES REINSTATED
Court Holds That Her Removal From
Polytechnic High School Was
' Illegal.
A writ of mandate has been issued by
judge Hunt directing the Board of Edu
cation to reinstate Mrs. Irene M. Reeves
as a teacher in the Polytechnic High,
School. Mrs! Reeves was removed froai
her position on April 26, 1809, and assigned
to a primary school. Subsequently she
was assigned to teach a class in the Chi
nC O S n luK^aftTJ-flled a petition for a
writ of mandate to compel the board to
reinstate her in her old position and to
pay her the difference between *140 a
month, the High School salary, and $76 _ a
month/which she drew as a teacher in tho
Chinese Primary, from the time of her re
moval asTteaThe; in the Polytechnic High
School up to the time of the filing of the
Pe in t his decision, which orders the writ to
issue and gives judgment in favor of the
petitioner for the difference In salary as
prayed. Judge Hunt says that not only
was the removal of Mrs. Reeves illegal,
but that the Board of Education erred In
placing J. R- Daniels, now Justice of tho
Peace, in the position made vacant by the
removal of Mrs. Reeves, as the certificate
held by Mrs. Reeves antedated that helu,
by Judge Daniels. n
Judge Daniels, though now on the bench,
also teaches an evening class at the Poly
technic High School. Judge Hunt s de
cision may necessitate the transfer or.
possibly, the removal of Daniels from the
active list of teachers.

MYSTEBIOTJS SHOOTING
ON KENTUCKY STREET
Louis Van BCarten, Saloon-Keeper,
and His Son Tell Conflicting
Stories.
A mysterious shooting affair occurred
In the saloon at 335 Kentucky street last
night. The proprietor, Louis Van Harten,
received a dangerous bullet wound
through the arm. Van Harten and his
son claim an unmasked man entered the
saloon and demanded money at the point
of a pistol and fired when refused.
Detective Gibson was detailed on the
case and. made a thorough investigation.
The location of the bloodstains on the
floor contradicted the story of the only
witnesses of the affair. At the hospital
the elder Van Harten told several con
flicting stories and the son became so
tangled In his statements that it became
evident that their version of the story was
a fiction.
Frequenters of the place tell stories of
violent conflicts between son and father,
in one of which, before several witnesses,
the father had attempted to shoot the son
with a revolver, of which he had several
lying about the place.
The first public appearance of the Cali
fornia volunteers since their return from
the Philippines, almost two' years ago, was
made last night at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion. Their popularity has not waned.
as was evidenced by the hearty welcome
given them by the hundreds of people who
thronged the immense building.

fine reputation for the State are now

the hospital she said her husband, Michael
J. O'Gara, was uniformly kind to her and
that she had no reason for wishing to kill
herself excepting that she sometimes got
severe pains in the back of the head, and
then she seemed to have no control over
her actions. After questioning her Dr.
Morrison said there was nothing mentally
the matter with Mrs. O'Gara, but advised
her to place herself under the care of her
family physician.
Mr. Blank, who bravely went to the res
cue of Mrs. O'Gara, has been many years
in the employ of. Castle Bros., His home
is in Berkeley, and he was on his way to
his office when the chance to show his
heroism canre. He did not pause to meas

In ah. instant. He partially dried his
clothes in the fireroom, and on reaching
the city reported at the office and then
went out and bought dry underclothing.
Later he took a run home to assure his
wife that he was all right and uninjured.
The Cudahy interest in the trade and
transportation of Alaska may yet be com
bined with that of the other Alaskan com
panies that recently fortned a corporation
on the Pacific Coast. The non-appear
ance of the name of the North American
Trading and Transportation Company of
Chicago, which is the Cudahy-Healey-
Weare concern, when the list of those in
the combine was given out, occasioned
considerable surprise, for the Chicago
company Is very largely interested and
has $5,000,000 invested in an Alaskan plant,
in trading stations, stocks of goods, etc.
At first it was supposed by the outsiders
that antagonism might be manifested by
the North American Trading and Trans
portation Company, notwithstanding that
Michael Cudahy came personally to San
Francisco to consult with the manage
ment of the other companies when the de
tails of the combination were under dis-r
cusslon.
A dispatch of inquiry was sent to the
North American Trading and Transporta
tion Company by The Call when the of
ficial announcement was made concerning
the parties who were included in the deal
and an answer was received that the com
pany did not know that it was an out
sider. The explanation of this puzzling
response is now furnished. The princioal
movers in the North American Trading
and Transportation Company were in
favor of taking joint action with the Pa
cific Coast companies In 'the Alaskan
trade, but there were some stockholders
who objected when they found that there
were laws of Illinois that seemed to stand
In the way. The management of the
Chicago company is .still working on the
refractory stockholders, according to a
dispatch from the East. Possibly the
deal will be closed in a few weeks.

stopped, a boat lowered and in four min
utes both rescued and rescuer were on
the deck again.
When the Oakland reached this side of
the bay Mrs. O'Gara was hurried to the
Harbor Hospital, where she was put to
bed. Shortly afterward her husband came
over from Oakland and took her away in
a hack. He could offer no explanation of
the woman's attempt to take her life.
"Tuesday night there were some friends
at the house and my wife seemed to be
in excellent spirits, said he. "When I
went to my saloon, at 62 Broadway, she
kissed me good-by, and you can imagine
my surprise w-ien I got a telephone mes
ea'ge saying my wife had jumped over
board from the deck of the Oakland."
When the Oakland left the mole on the 8
a m. trip there were about 1500 passengers
aboard. The vessel had not been three
minutes under way when the cry ''man
overboard" was raised. A rush was made
to the starboard side of the boat, and a
woman buoyed up by her skirts was plain
ly seen floating rapidly astern. In an-

FILLS COLUMBIA
The executive committee on reception to
President McKinley held a special meet
inÂ» yesterday afternoon at the office of
the chairman, Irving M. Scott, to con
sider particularly the matter of street
decoration and illumination for that
event. A, Sbarboro, chairman of the
committee on decorations, made a report
on the committee's plans, which involve
an estimated expenditure of $10,000 and
contain some novel features.
The plans provide for the illumination
of the ferry depot tower and the dome of
the City Hall. On the former alone 180O
sixteen candie-power Incandescent lights
will be ured. The street illumination
proper will present features departing
radically from those of former illumina
tions. Arc lights will be used instead of
incandescent tamps They will be placed
aiong either siae cf the streets to be ii
lurainatcd at intervals of about fifty feet
and alternating. Each light will be cov
ered with a large Chinese or Japanese
lar.UTn to tone down its glare. Mercnants
and property owners are expected to dec
crate and illuminate lavishly, and the un
covtred arc iights wouid shirre with fuch
a glare that the finer effects would be de
stroyed. But with lanterns to soften the
giare. the committee believes the plan it
has Lit upon will provide a novel and
beautiful illumination.
Market street frcm the ferry depot to
the City Hall, Montgomery street to
Washington, Washington to Keafny
street, Kearny to Market and Third
streets, from Market to the Southern Pa
cific depot are the thoroughfares included
in the lighting scheme. Between the arc
lights there will be hung festoons of ever
greens, and large flags will be used pro
fusely in the decorations. Fireworks are
to be pet off along Market etreet on the
night of the reception.
Awaiting Result of Canvass.
The plan was not formally approved by
the executive committee, as the matter of
funds must be taken into consideration,
and the committee did not deem it ad
visable to authorize the letting of con
tracts until subscriptions have reached a
sum that will warrant the expenditure of
PO large an amount. The plan has the
committees approval, however, and will
probably be formally adopted at the next
meeting.
Chairman AVatkins of the committee on
banquet reported that his committee
would meet to-day to consider the ad
visability of securing a larger place for
the banquet than any of those that have
been under consideration. Maple Hall had
been decided upon, but it Is known now
that it will be inadequate in size. The
Sfarl^s Hall of the Hopkins Art Insti
tute and Mechanics' Pavilion have been
jnisgested in Hjat connection.
The finance committee reported sub
scriptions to the amount of $7209 75. The
committee believes that within the next
ten days it will have secured the entire
$C'\OC0.
Subscriptions Reported.

CLEMENT HOPKINS, WHO HAS

MCET GIVE UP THE SHIP.â "United States
District Judge de Haven handed down a de
cision yesterday in the suit of M. R. Roberts

1750 damages and possession of the schooner.
Acquisition of Utilities.
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that when it has
plans and estimates of the actual cost of
original construction ready upon any ono
public utility the proposition may be sub
mitted for the permanent acquisition
thereof to the people, but no proposition
can be submitted until pians and estimates
have been procured.
REIS' METHODS
ARE VERY LAX
Says He Never Examines
Bail Money Order
: Indorsements.
The preliminary examination of Daniel
J. Sullivan on the charge of : forgery was
held yestetday before Justice of the Peace
Percy 1 V.. Long, ; sitting in Police Judge
Cabaniss* court. The defendant was rep
resented Â¦ by Attorney T. , J. Lennon, and
Assistant District Attorney Hanley con
ducted the prosecution, assisted by As
sistant District Attorney Deuprey. The
Â¦ evidence of \ J. \ O. Reis, cashier Â¦ in the'
Treasurer's office, was a startling surprise
to the prosecution, as it showed a method
of- conducting business so lax as to \ be
almcst Inconceivable. Reis admitted that
when orders were presented . for the re
turn of bail money he never looked to
the indorsement, as he considered it was
not essential, and he only looked to see
that the signature of the Judge was all
right. \ His evidence will in /ill probability
result in' the defendant's discharge.
"When-the case was called Hanley asked
that he be permitted. to substitute a new
complaint, as there were clerical errors in
.the old one, and Lennon offered no objec
tion. J. - Evans, saloon-keeper, 116 Eddy
street, swore to the new complaint.. Sulli
van- was. booked, on the charge and In
structed and arraigned. , Lennon then in
terposed* a. demurrer to the complaint on
various grounds,. which the Judge over
ruled. *. ..-.Â¦ , Â¦Â¦.Â¦-...â¢Â¦-Â¦Â¦..â¢ - % ,--_ Â¦. ". - Â¦ â¢-
; Evans testified that he had furnished $250
cash bail. on. March 22 for the release of
Ella Thomas, charged with disturbing the
peace; In Judge. Conlan's.-. court. He got
a receipt for the money." He did not in
dorse his name, to an order for the re
turn of the bail money. In cross-examina
tion he admitted that he had on several
occasions 'Â¦ previously authorized i Sullivan
to sign his name to orders for the return
of .bail money when he had been too 'busy
to. go to court, but he had not done so
in the case of, the $250. While Evans was
being examined it came out that, although
the,, woman i was -charged with disturbing
the peace; -the -order for the returnof
j the i bail , money < gave the : charge I as i va
grancy. 'Â¦â¢-..' .:

LEMENT HOPKINS, a San Fran
/[^ cisco boy and. erstwhile "super"
ll at Morosco's Grand Opera-house,
N^!^ has returned after six years to
the scene of his early histrionic
I ttruggles.
Mr. Hopkins is stage manager for
Blanche "Walsh's production "More Than
Queen," now playing at the Columbia.
Hopkins has been going over the theatri
cal hurdles to success rapidly since he
left San Francisco to Join Augustln Daly's
company six years ago. Until that time
he had been doing stunts*in papier mache
armor and proclaiming to "me lord" the
arrival cf the carriage at Morosco's for
a stipend of $3 per week.
Daly took the aspiring youth on several
'trips to Europe and gave him rapid ad
vancement with his company.
When the great manager died Hopkins
â¢was his stage manager, and when the Im
mortal band cf players that made Daly's
Theater famous was scattered Hopkins
attached himseif to "More Than Queen,"
and is regarded as an adept In the in
tricate art of running the mysterious re
gion behind the curtain.

Delegates in Annual Ses
sion at St. John's
Church.
The annual session \ of the Â¦ California
and Nevada District Synod of the Luther
an church was opened last night at St.
John's Lutheran Church, Twenty-second
and-Capp streets. Delegates were present
from all parts of the two States which
compose the district and Lutherans from
San Francisco and the bay cities swelled
the audience to the limit' of the church's
.capacity. - ~ . ..-â¢'â¢
This opening meeting was devoted to the
synodical sermont delivered by the Rev.
F. Pieper, president of the Missouri Sy
nod, which has jurisdiction over "the Lu
theran churches of all the United States
and Canada. Rev. "Mr. Pieper is profes
sor of dogmatics in the Lutheran The
ological School at St. Louis and is one of
the most eminent men- of the sect.. -
The Rev. J. H. Schroeder, pastor of St.
John's Church, opened Â¦ the service * with
scripture reading and prayer. The regu
lar choir of the church rendered music for
the service. â¢ . . ' -".-â¢Â¦
The' theme of the sermon was embodied
in the question, "What must be the mes
sage of the church, to the twentieth cen
.tury?" The speaker said by-way of in
troduction that many, think the twentieth
century requires something more thanHhe
old gospel; that there are those who say
that its message should be one of science,
one of progress. . But repentance and for
giveness of sins thiough Christ's atone
ment .must remain the church's message
to mankind in every age. . Continuing the
speaker said in part: â¢ , . f .-,
According to the world's standards there .Is
much difference betwesn men. Some are rated
as good, some. as bad. But before God all men
are sinners. I admit that virtue Â¦ and Â¦ public
honesty are the pillars upon which civilization
and the welfare of all nations must rest. Hon
esty and virtue must be encouraged Â¦ and t ap
preciated. Incalculable harm is done - all Â¦ na
tions by evil men within them. Yet in spite
of this apparently .Â¦:. great difference between
men we must preach lo.the world! that all are
sinners before God and as such all-must're
pent. ' ' *-. - - \ ; . Â¦Â¦ .- â¢ â¢ y. Â¦ Â¦ â¢-,.',
There can be no other message to the,twen
tieth century than this universal message .'of
God to universal .mankind: "Repent of your
sins and humble yourtelf before God." Christ
was crucified, died and rose again, and through
his atonement alone have we : forgiveness for
our sins. . Â¦ Â¦â¢. . - '. ' â¢ â¢ Â¦ . ' "â¢ .;
Men may \ say, "Has not the world received
much good through Buddha, Â¦ through ' Moham
med, through Confucius?"- Yes. Â¦ my dear
friends, so the world has, but. Buddha did not
die for us,- nor did Mohammed,. nor. Confucius.'
Christ alone atoned on the cross for our sins.
Therefore foregiveness is in Christ alone. No
man will ever obtain foregiveness I and eternal
life : through science and the progress of civil
ization. In : the 'twentieth century, as In the
past, repentance and forgiveness for sins re
main the central thought of our religion. Â¦
The synod will meet this morning at 9:30
o'clock, when delegates will be enrolled
and organization for the work of the ses
sion effected. The Revv J. M. 1 Buehler,
pastor of. St. Paulus Lutheran Church, is
president of the district synod and : the
Rev. J. H. Thelss of Oakland is secretary
There will be morning and afternoon
meetings every day until next Wednesday,
when the session closes. | A special meet
ing .will . be held â¢ Sunday - night. AH the
proceedings will be conducted in German.
THE feature of the day's entertain
ment at the Allied Arts exhlbl
tion at Mechanics' Pavilion yes
ter was the sainted and instruct
' ive address of Professor Pliny E.
Goddard on "The Indians of Northern
California." The professor dealt briefly â¢
with their history and habits of life and
more at length on their art as illustrated
by the basket work, of which such excel
lent examples are to be seen in the ex
hibition.
The musical programme of -the,, after
noon was a rare treat Miss Ethel Lid
"ston gave two violin 30I08 with'- pleas'ng
effect, the "Kyarriha" CVVIeniawski) and
Vieuxtemps" Fantasia (first movement);

much pleasure. .
