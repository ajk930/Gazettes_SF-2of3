TVar has decided to replace them a3
rapidly as circumstances "will permit witli
the new regiments now in course of or

been adopted by which troops will be
given one year's service in the United

regiment always having one, battalion in
reserve in the United States.
The regular troops in the Philippines
will be brought home gradually and thÂ«

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April
19.â The lecture by Hon. Whitelaw
Reid to the students of Stanford
University to-day was a plea for
recognition of the higher ideals of
education. The distinguished statesman
and diplomatist took the advanced ground
that the worth of universities should not
be judged by the number of graduates
they might turn out, but rather by the
highest intellectual' planes achieve"d by
those whom these institutions have fitted
for their life work.
The address began with a reference to
current estimates of the world's progress
in the century ended four months ago.
The strides America has made in ihis ex
traordinary century in subduing a conti
nent, in spreading out over the islands
of the sea. in gaining and maintaining in
dependence and in abolishing slavery were
not its most important achievement. That
lay in building up from ocean to ocean a
gigantic system, free practically to the
poorest as well as to the richest child' of
the republic, under which any man could
learn anything. Not in the work of arm
ies and navies, not in the inventions that
amazed, not In the growth that bewildered
nor even In the general diffusion of com
fort that beggared the world for parallels
was our sxeat slory to be found. Rather
it was in the mind that had been en
lightened, in the life that had been shaped
and directedâ in a word, it was in the kind
of man that America reared.
The lecturer referred to Stanford Uni
versity as perhaps the greatest and cer
tainly the most beneficent monument of
parental grief the world had- ever seen,
and paid a warm tribute to the Stanfords
and to the university. He spoke next of
the enormous ag-gregate of other recent
private gifts, as well as public appropria
tions in this country for education, and
asked what was to come of it all? ' Should
we rest content with the widest diffusion
of learning in the world or should we in
sist also on the highest and best learning
of the world? The lecturer enumerated
and discussed things often said against
the present systemâ complaints that many
were beine educated out of fitness for
anything they were capable of doing, com
plaints that many small colleges and even
some large ones are little more than pre
tentious high schools, cheapening degrees;
deceiving students and degrading educa
tion; complaints of the bookkeeping. spirit
in others that makes hours of study rath
er than maturity of mind and acquirement
the preliminary for professional courses;
complaints that colleges keep a young
man too long from an active business life
and so make him enter it at a disadvan
tage, and complaints as to post graduate
studies shaped v not so as best to promote
sound learning but so as quickest to get a
doctor's degree. He then said: , -* .- 'â¢Â¦ Â¦ ;

but not free; English^ universities free. but not

MANILA, April 1^â Aguinaldo has at
last issued his address to the Filipino peo
ple, advising a general surrender? of the
insurgents. - To signalize this important
step in the pacification of, the -country
General MacArthur orders Che Vc'.esse, on
swearing allegiance" to the TJnite'd' Slates;
of one thousand insm-gents prisoners. ,
.General MacArthur and General Bates,
the 'commander of -the depaVtment of
Southern Luzon, who Is shortly* to ' sail
for the United States, reviewed to-day
the Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth Volun
teer Infantry, which sail oo . the trans
port Sheridan Monday next for home.
During the past week 28S rifles have been
surrendered.
Will Have Good Effect. 'Â¦
WASHINGTON, April 19.â It is believed
by the administration that the manifesto
of , Aguinaldo will have a decidedly good
effect both in the Philippines and in this
country. It will take some time for its
dissemination among the Filipinos, ' but
it is expected to berof great service and
make rapid the improvement of the situa
tion which set in some time ago, and
which hasbecome much marked of late.
Especial gratification is felt at the un
reserved tone of the document and the
full acceptance it indicates of ; American
rule. This, it is felt, -.will bring, to the
support of,- the government many Fili
pinos, who, wishing for peace, have hesi
tated to assist the Taft Commission.
More Liberty for Aguinaldo.
In this* country it is expected to reduce
the criticism- of the administration/and
to cause less discussion of the general
policy of the war in the islands and more
consideration of the important matter of
the best administration to be evolved for
their government. It is to this work that
theTaft Commission is now bending all
its energies. : Aguinaldo, now that he has
accepted American sovereignty, probably
will be, given more liberty than he> Jias
enjoyed hitherto. His services will' be
used as far as possible in the pacification
of the islands. The extent, however, to
which he will be permitted his freedom
is for General MacArthur to determine,
with the assistance of the Taft Commis
sion, for the aim of the home government
will be to rest largely upon the views
held by its representatives in the islands.
Soot Receives a ,Copy.
Â¦Coincident with the issue of the mani
festo . at Manila, Secretary Root made
public the copy received from ' General
MacArthur. This came to hand en the
10th of A*pril, and differs slightly in its
phraseology^ from that made public in
Manila. General : MacArthur informed
the department at that time that the
manifesto had . been prepared by Aguin
aldo with the assistance only of the two
staff officers who were .with him at. the
time he -was * captured. Secretary Root
declined' to-be- interviewed on the- sub
ject of the manifesto further than to eay
that it was dignified ! in , tone and admir

P.AKERSFIELD, April 19.â Vigilantes
and alleged claim-jumpers fought a furi
ous battle at about midnight last night In
the Midway oil district, between McKit
.tdÂ£ k _> J Il4 Su J2??^. an< L about forty-five
miles ;Jrom here. Two of the claim-jump
ers were mortally wounded. So far as
1< timed none of the vigilantes were
touched by bullets.
Owing to the remcteness of the scene of
the conflict exact details are difficult to
obtain, but from fairly accurate sources
it -is learned that there were about twen
ty-five vigilantes and from six to ten
claim-jumpers engaged in the fight; that
oO-Sl rifles and heavy pistols were used,
and that the contest was at close range.
The wounded men are G. P. Cornell Jr.,
late of Quincy, Plumas County, and J. T.
Wsjkcr,' late of Nevada. Cornell was hit
<wice, one bullet passing through his
chest. It is believed he will die. Walker
was hit in the breast and is badly
wounded. â¢ .
Cornell is' said to be a professional
"gun man" and delights In following the
kind of business he engaged in last night.
He is "dead game." He fought last night
even after he was shot down. Durinp- the
battle he stood near a water tank. It is
said that the tank was riddled by bullets.
The jumpers were laagered on section
26, Z2.-ZZ, where they proposed to begin
boring 1 for oil. They were expecting
tri.uljle, and in consequence had their
l>icltcts out. The lirst Intimation they ahd
cf the Immediate presence of the enemy
came from Cornell's post. The vigilantes
sang out to Cornell to hold up his hands.
Cornell defiantly refused and with an oath
coolly commanded them to hold up their
hiii'ds and not to come- a step farther or
he would fire. The vigilantes kept com
ing, Cornell fired and the battle opened.
When the firing ceasedâ why, it was not
learnedâ the vigilantes warned the jump
ers that this was their first call, and a
second one would' be made if the inter
lopers did not evacuate the land. They
then retired in order that the wounded
misht be cared for.
J. W. Crosland. at one time deputy
County Recorder, is said to be leader of
the jumpers, and he is reported as having
s^aid this morning at McKittrlck, where lie
went to wire to the home office, "Let 'em
come: -we're heeled for them," when dis
cussing: the possibility of another collision
to-night.
4TEg vigilantes are determined men and
are out to rid the district cf jumpers, and
it is more than likely another battle will
tcke place to-night.
The land in question, section 26, is
claimed by the Mount Diablo Oil Com
pany, ar.d the jumpers represent the Su
perior Sunset Company. They do not deny
that the Mount Diablo was the first lo
cator, but claim it failed to do its assess
ment work in time, and hence lost title to
the land. The Mount Diablo people claim
the contrary.
The Superior Sunset people say they
are bncked by Judge Claflln, late of
Plumas County. The Judge said to-day:
Â¦'Our men ran up against vigilantes and
got the worst of it. The vigilantes com
mittee was instigated by the Mount Diablo
people."
The land was jumped last Saturday, and
cv<?r since the air r>as been, redolent with
war talk. Eight or ten members of the
Mount Diablo Company, armed to the
teeth, it is said, were camped a half-mile
away when the batle raged.

BELIEVE I am not in error in presuming that the unh'appy fate to which my adverse fortune has led me is not a surprise to those who have been familiar with. the progress of the war. The lessons taught with a full meaning,
Â¦ and which have recently come to my knowledge, suggest with irresistible force that a complete termination of hostilities and lasting peace are not_orily desirable. but absolutely essential to the welfare of the Philippine Islands.
The Filipinos have never been dismayed at their weakness, nor have they faltered in following the path pointed out by their fortitude and" courage. The time has come, however, in which they find their ad
: vance along this-path to be impeded by an irresistible force, which, while it restrains them, yet enlightens their minds and opens tc? them another course, presenting them the cause of peace. This -cause has been joyfully em
braced by the majority of my fellow-countrymen, who have already united around the glorious sovereign banner of the United States. In this banner they repose: their trust and belief that under its protection the Filipino
people will attain all those promised liberties which they are beginning to enjoy. The country has declared unmistakably in favor of peace. So be it. . There has been enough of blood, enough tears and enough desolation. This
wish cannot be ignored by the men still in arms if they are animated by a desire to serve our people, which- has. thus clearly manifested its will. So do I respect this will, now that it is known to me.
After mature deliberation I resolutely proclaim to the world that I cannot refuse to heed th'e voic y e of a. people longing for peace, nor the lamentations of thousands of families yearning to see their dear ones en
joying the liberty and the promised generosity of the great American nation. . â¢
By acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States throughout the Philippine archipelago, as I now do and without;any reservation whatsoever, I believe that I am serving thee, my beloved
country. May happiness be thine. â¢ . : * . , â¢

THE GEYSERS, April 19.â Some re
merkable changts have been made in
Devil's Canyon as a result of the rigors or.
the past winter. The "devil's postofflce"
which for years has stood as one of the
attractions in this wonder spot of nature s
mysteries, was dislodged by high water
'and swept into the canyon. With it went
the great elm tree that stood on the brink
of the precipice, close to the "postoffice.
Some other sweeping changes have been
made by the elements, and on the whole
the list of unusual phenomena that have
made this canyon the most interesting
spot in California has been somewhat the
gainer. Several new and powerful gey
sers have burst forth, and the, old ones
appear to have gained added force. The
witches' 'caldron has been widened and
deepened, until now it is a small lake of
hissing and churning water. On frosty

SAN JOSE, April 19.â The contest over
the estate of Dennis Cullen, the hermit
rancher who died in the hills back of Mil
pitas In December, lS99,iias been decided in
favor of the Irish heirs, two sisters. | Cul
len, who lived the lonely life of a cattle
man, died in squalor in a little cabin. He
left an estate worth about $20,000. For
years he had held himself aloof from his
family, and they knew but little about
him. , He had three sistersâ Mrs. Rosa
Sparks of San Francisco and Mrs. Mary
Brogerty and Mrs. Maria Gaffrey of Ire
land. Mrs. Sparks â¢was with him at the
last and to her he left all his property.
This was done by deed. As soon as the
sisters in Ireland heard of the wealth
they began a contest. The charge of un
due influence on the. part of Mrs. Sparks
was made, . â¢ i
At the trial it developed that Cullen had
been found in an unconscious condition in
his cabin and had remained in such a con- %
dition until his death. , The will Â¦ had been
signed by one of the-witnesses, who held

The annual reports will show that the
order has a healthy growth, and much
beneficial activity. During the past year
the membership has been increased by i
1863 In the same period the sum of $10.OX>
in the aggregate was paid out for sick
Work to Be Done.
This programme promises so much that
the delegates are envied by their less for
tunate stay-at-home brothersâ and Bis
ters, for that matter. Still there will be
enough work to keep the Grand Parlor
busy with legislative and other concerns
during the hours devoted to deliberations.
There will 'be contests for the offices of
secretary and orator. S. A. D. Jones will
try to wrest the secretaryship from Henry
Lunstedt. M. Â«T. Dooling of Hollister and
Charles E. McLaughlin are the candidates
for the position of grand orator. In ad
dition to the annual election there is the
selection of the locality for the 9th of
September celebration to be attended to
and the naming of the city to be honored
by the next Grand Parlor. Then there is
the usual routine business to engage the
attention of the delegates.
There will be two proposed amendments
to the constitution. W. H. Devlin of Sac
ramento is the author of one and H. O.
W. Dinkelspiel of Bay City Parlor stands
sponsor for the other. Devlin would limit
the membership of the order so that it
shall consist of white males -who were
born within the State of California on or
prior to September 9. 1900, and the male
lineal descendants of white males who
were born within the State on or prior to
the 9th of September, 1900. Dinkelspiel
would extend the jurisdiction outside of
California to permit the organization of
parlors In cities where there are resid
ing a number of native Californians. Both
of these propositions .bid fair to be hon
ored with a long and earnest discussion.
Indeed the discussion concerning them
has already informally begun.
The citizens of Santa Barbara have
raised $5000 for the entertainment of the
Grand Parlor, and nothing will be done
by halves. The streets will be decorated
and illuminated. There will be excursions
on Monday and a public reception in the
evening; polo games on Tuesday and a
grand ball in the Arlington in the even
ing; a barbecue for 10,000 "natives" on
Wednesday; a banquet for the Grand Par
lor on Thursday; excursions to various
points of interest on Friday; athletic
sports on Saturday and a sacred concert
on Sunday.
THE final preparations for the
twenty-fourth annual session of
the Grand Parlor of^ the Native
Sons of the Golden West at Santa
Barbara and for; the attendant
festivities in the "beautiful city by the
sea are made. To-morrov^ morning at 7:30
o'clock khe special train that will take the
delegates from the northern part of the
State will leave Third and Townsend
streets. To-day the thousands of Native
Sons, and especially the 300 delegates rep
resenting the 149 parlors and 11,958 mem
bers, will be in a flutter of pleased ex
pectation, for the coming week in Santa

LOS ANGELES. April 19. -A broken rail
near the long 1 trestle near Piru station
caused another wreck on the new coast
route at 10 o'clock to-night. That no
lives were lost was, from the meager re
port received at this end of the line, due
more to grood luck than anything- else. As
it was, a number of passengers were
Lruipcd and scratched and seriously
shaken up.
The accident occurred to the daylight
limited shortly after it had passed
through Piru. The engineer had slowed
down fcr the trestle and a switch when
a rail snapped and the chair car and two
day eojierus jumped the track and turned
â¢ ver on their sides. Every car was filled
with passengers. The engine and forward
r art of the train were on the trestle when
the accident occurred. Fortunately the
wrecked cars were -he last three on the
tra'.ri and* they stopped abruptly the in
fctant they left the track.
Notice of the accident was sent to head
quarters and at 10:30 o'clock a wrecking
train carrying a full crew and two rail
road surg-eon-5 left River Station under
full steam for the scene. The passengers
from the ditched coaches were crowded
into the forward coaches and an hour af
ter the accident the train resumed its

PORT TPWNSEND, April 19.â The Brit
ish steamship Caithness is at Diamond
Point quarantine station with seven of her
crew ill with smallpox, three of them be
ing in a critical condition. The Caithness
arrived here to-day from Japan, via Vic
toria, B. C-, having a clean bill of health
from the British authorities at Williams
head Station. When boarded by TJnited
States Quarantine Officer M. H. Foster
smallpox was found among the crew and
the vessel was. ordered to quarantine, to
gether with British Vice Consul Klocker
and Customs Inspector Lehr, who had
been permitted by the captain to board
the vessel ahead of the quarantine officer.
Three of the cases were well developd.
while the other four were in the first
stages of the dreaded disease.
After passing quarantine at Victoria thÂ»
Caithness proceeded to Comax. B. C.
where she took on coal. While there her
crew mingled with people on the dock,
and at the coal bunkers there is an un
confirmed rumor that a convalescent pa
tient was landed at that place.
The action of the captain in allowing
any one to board the vessel ahead of the
quarantine officer is severely criticised,
and the British health officers at Victoria
are roundly denounced for their laxity.
The Caithness was Inspected on Tuesday
at Willlamshead and several of the cases
were well developed at that time. It is
said that one case broke out on the vessel
the day after sailing from Japan, nineteen
days ago. The attention of the Canadian
Government will be called to the matter
by the quarantine officer at this place.

Of a New Catarrh Cure.
A large and constantly increasing ma-
jority of the American people are catarrh
sufferers. This Is not entirely the result
of our changeable climate, but because
modern investigation has clearly proven
that many diseases, known by other
names, are really catarrh.. Formerly the
name catarrh -was applied almost exclu-
sively to the common nasal catarrh, but
the throat, stomach, liver, bladder, kid-
neys and intestines are subject to ca-
tarrhal diseases as well as the nasal pas-
Bapes.
. In fact, wherever there fs mucous mem-
brane there is a feedirtg ground for ca-
tarrh.
The usual remedies, inhalers, sprays,
douches or powders, have been practically
failures, as far as anything more than
temporary relief was concerned, because
ihey simply dry up the mucous secretions
without having the remotest effect upon
the blood and liver, which are- the real
sources of catarrhal diseases.
It has befen known for some years that
the radical cuÂ»-e of catarrh could never
come from local applications, but from an
internal remedy, acting on the blood and
expelling the catarrhal poison from the
F.vstem.
A new internal preparation which has
b<?en on the market only a short time hits
met with remarkable success as a genu-
ine, radical cure for catarrh..
It mav be found in any drugstore, sold
under the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, large, pleasant tasting lozenges, com-
posed principally of antiseptic ingredients.
Eucalyptol. Gualacol, Sanguinaria, Hy-
drasiin and similar catarrh specifics.
Dr. Ainslee in epeaking of the new ca-
tarrh cure says: "I have tried the new ca-
tarrh remedy. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,

COPPEROPOLIS, April 19.â The love of
two men for a woman â a winsome moun
tain lass â was responsible last night for
as shocking a tragedy as any romancer
could conjure up. Maddened because Miss
Bessie Cobb of this place accepted the at
tentions of George MpCarty in preference
to his own, John H. Gorham lay In wait
for his rival and riddled his body with
bullets. Following the murder he com
mitted suicide by blowing himself to
shreds with an enormous charge of dyna
mite. Both men were prominent In this
locality and the Innocent cause -of their
estrangement, with its tragic sequel, is
one of the most popular young ladies of
Copperopolis.
Gorham was madly In love with MIsa
Cobb. whom McCarty was courting. Last
night the Dramatic Club held a meeting
and both McCarty and Gorham attended.
Gorham left the hall a half hour, in ad
vance of McCarty and J^lss Cobb, who
drove in a buggy to the young lady's
home. Arriving at the gate, McCarty
alighted and assisted Miss Cobb from the
buggy and bade her "Good night." As
she passed through the gate McCarty
started to .get into his buggy. . ,-Â¦
Gorham Â¦was secreted close by. As Mc-
Carty mounted the steps of his vehicle
the assassin fired three times, one bullet
taking effect in his victim's back. Mc-
Carty ran and Gorham Â¦ pursued him.
When about 400 yards from the scene of
the first shooting they grappled. McCarty
was weak from loss of blood and Gorham
broke away from him and emptied his re
volver, two bullets takings. effect in Me-
Carty's right side, killing him instantly.
Gorham threw his pistol down and ran
to an old, vacant house, where he had
some dynamite in readiness. Placing the
dynamite upon the floor, he lighted the
fuse and fell with his stomach across the
cartridge, -which exploded and tore him
to shreds. - .

Dâ â EL. MONTE, April 19.â The meet
ing of the Transcontinental Pas
senger Association was brought
. to a close this morning. Several
of the more important questions
were decided at this closing session, prob
ably the most vital being the abolishing
of colonist excursions. Action was taken
concerning the special rate which has
been offered by the northern lines to off
set that -for the Epworth League conven
tion In San Francisco in July. The rail
roads that terminate in San Francisco
were anxious that the Northern Pacific,
the Great Northern and the Canadian Pa
cific withdraw the special rate, which is
$45 from St. ,Paul to Portland and Puget
Sound ports 'during the convention. The
managers of the northern lines claimed
that a special rate had been offered to
the Epworth Leaguers and unless they
offered some inducement they would lose
business. They gained their point and
will sell their tickets at a cut rate, but
passengers will have to return East over
the northern lines and there will be no
TRAGEDY CLOSES
FEUD OF LOVERS
At the meeting held here to-day it was
decided between the Southern Pacific and
the Santa Fe that in the future there
would be no cutting of rates, but that
the two roads â and, in fact, all of the
transcontinental lines that are in the as
sociationâwill stand together and each
take a percentage of the business. This
will stop the cutting that has marked the
obtaining of Government contracts in the
past. The first detachment of sailors will
arrive In San Francisco by the middle of
July.
No Cutting of Hates.
The Government has sent circulars to
all railroad companies Inviting bids for
the transportation of sailors who have
been recruited in the Bast and that are
to go to Manila to relieve the sailors that
have been stationed there for a consider
able period. At the present' time, and un
til June 30. the Santa Fe holds the con
tract for the transportation of all naval
business. Bids for the new contract must
be filed before May 6.
interchange of tickets via San Francisco.
This Is the only step the roads that ter-,
minate in San Francisco can take in re
taliation.
The railroad men do not take kindly to
colonist rates. There are two more ex
cursions to arrive in San Franciscoâ on
April 23 and 30â and these will close the
colonist business. The argument that the
railroad men put forward is that few act
ual colonists take advantage of the rate.
They say that well-to-do people put their
pride into their pockets, buy a colonist
ticket and ride under false colors. Down
deep it is a slap in the face for the North
ern Pacific Railroad. -This line is not a
member of the Transcontinental Passen
ger Association. It receives more benefit
from the colonist rate than does any other
line,, and being anxious to .build up the
population along its tracks it considers
this the best means.
Transportation, of the Bead.
At the meeting to-day the question of
shipping bodies, by express was brought
up. Some of the members of the asso
ciation were anxious to induce the com
panies to transport the dead. in this way.
They . failed, however, as there is an im
mense revenue from California to the
East in this branch of the passenger ser
viqe. The same rule will be enforced as
Ir. the past; a ticket for the corpse and
one for the escort must be bought on the
shipment of a body to the East.
At present the Canadian Pacific is the
most generous to missionaries. It makes
a rate of $30 75 for all clergy traveling
from Chicago to its terminus on the Pa
cific Coast. To-day the San Francisco
routes were asked to make the same rate,
but the motion was lost, and the clergy
will continue to pay $36 25 from Chicago to
San Francisco.
The question . of uniform baggage rates
has been referred to the next meeting of
the association.
Before the adjournment a vote of thanks
was extended the management of the Ho
tel ' del Monte for the service that has
been rendered the association. This after-*
noon a number of railroad men in coaches
and brakes took the seventeen-mile drive.
Most of the members left this evening for
San Francisco, a few remaining, however,
to hold private conferences in reference
to transportation matters.
Potts is a new witness. He testified at
the hearing in the magistrate's court that
on the day - following the death of Rice
Patrick had given him a check for $25,000,
made out to him by the millionaire, which
had been certified by the Fifth-avenue
Trust- Company. Potts deposited it in
the Chatham National Bank in trust for
Patrick, but he said to-day that he had
taken the. check out since and handed It
to the administrator of the Rice estate.

Intelligence.
Do not those superficial defects which our
critics glibly enumerate go deeper? Has there
not been a. constant tendency develODed by
democratic Institutions thus, far everywhere. In
ancient times as well as in our own, to level
down, sometimes to pare off individuality in
character and action; often to resent and pull
down superiority, to encourage mediocrity and
article of true democratic faith that medioc
rity is equal to the best and just as good?
Naturally this tendency which a Republic gen
erally seems to develop will lead to treating
men not as individuals but In great masses. It
thus Invades the field of education and con
verts the noblest work confided to man, the
molding, one might almost say the very crea
tion of Individual character into high pressure
arrangements for the production of scholars
by wholesale â into schemes to shape and manu
facture characters and lives like chromos or
carpets by machinery.
If the best education for a republic should
tend to counteract the defects it develops, and
ro elevate and strengthen It for a long and
successful life, is it not clear that we jshall
do better with less wholesale processes, that
our effort must be to exert Individual influence
upon the individual youth to be trained, with
reference to his individual wants, and that If
changes are to occur It -is betters colleges we
want instead of bigger ones?
More Individual Attention.
I plead for a system that would put the
most Into one's life, rather than for that
which enables one quickest to begin life and
earn a living. The plea for the former in
volves no disparagement or the latter. It, too,
lias Its place, supremely important in the past.
highly Important still and always. But let
us not deceive ourselves as to proportions and
values. It Is not the highest. To make a
life full, rounded, with balanced character and
Eerenity' of Judgment, with trained capacities
for the highest work, the highest appreciation,
the fullest and purest enjoyment, that Is a
greater thing- than to make a living'.
Unless these observations have wholly missed
their purpose they must now have led your
minds at least to consider if not to accept
two propositions, which seem to me to sum
up the next advances for American colleges
and universities. They need now to give
more Individual attention to the individual
pupil, and they need to lead him on paths to
the best learning for the best life, rather than
merelr for the quickest business or profes
sional success. The first proposition does not
point to big colleges; and the second does not
point to university development exclusively on
the lines thus far most In favor. Bigger col
leges must mean less Individual influence on
the eager, immature mind; the specialization
most in favor in our universities Is that which
leads to ways to make a living, and while
no one could want less of that, the highest
education must give more of something else.
The lecturer dwelt on the advantages of
the old college training In the humanities,
philosophy, mathematics and science as
a preparation for advanced education, and*
continued: " '
It is to the hlg-h duty of perpetuating and
enlarKlng that exalted type we have the risrht
to summon our ; institutions of tho most ad

This collegiate course was the best basis for

PEKING. April 19.â Owing to the ex
citement caused by the burning of the
Imperial palace, all sorts of rumors are in
circulation regarding tho origin of the
catastrophe. Nothing is yet known with
any degree of definiteness, but already
the -outbreak is ascribed in many quar
ters to the Chinese. It is, consequently,
feared that the disaster may have politi
cal results unless the mystery is speedily
explained.
The ruin of the palace of the Empress
is complete, and it was not until late
this morning that the flames could be got
under control. Count von Waldersee,
who was hauled out through a window of
his asbestos house in the palace court
yard only a minute before it collapsed like
tin foil, has all day been receiving con
gratulations from the international mili
tary and diplomatic representatives as
sembled here. Of sll his outfit and docu
ments. Count von Walciersee saved only
one article â his Marshal's staff, which was
a gift from the Emperor. General
Schwartzkopf . sacrificed his life by en
endeavoring to save some of the marshal's
valuable papers.
It is noteworthy that the French sol
diers who distinguished themselves so
brilliantly In fighting the names were
commanded by Colonel Marchand, the
most popular of French officers. It has
long been a common saying here that
Colonel Marchand' s men would follow
him through fire and water. They proved
the truth of the statement in splendid
style last night.
Progress of the French.
Dr. Mumm von Schwartzenstein, Ger
man Minister to China, in order to allay
the excitement here and doubtless abroad,
has made a statement to me. He declares
that the expedition under General von
Lessel, now proceeding westward from
Paotingf u . does not contemplate the in
vasion of Shansi.
"The facts," said Dr. Mumm von
Schwiirtzeiisteln, "are these: General Lu,
with an undetermined, number of troops,
is intrenched In neutral ground where, by
agreement, no troops were to remain. His
position commands the Shansi passes and
further menaces ours. We believe that
General Lu has been ordered to withdraw
by the Chinese authorities, and we are
only proceeding against him because it is
Imperative. Unless General Lu gives bat
tle and in consequence active operations
on our part become a military necessity,
there will be no invasion of Shansi."
Chinese Expected to Flee.
Dr. Mumm von Schwartzenstein referred
to the fact that the French troops are
now within ten miles of the Chinese posi
tion and the Germans axe coming up
fast. A strong impression prevails here
that the Chinese will not await their ar
rival.
LONDON, April 20.â "There are vers'
strong indications," says the Shanghai
correspondent of the Morning Post, "that
the Japanese Government proposes to put
itself at the head of the reform movement
in China in order to overthrow the Man
chu dynasty, which It considers bound
hand and foot by Russia."

PACIFIC GROVE. April 19.â The prep
arations now In progress for the Grand
Army celebration in this city point to one
of the largest and most successful en
campments in the history of the depart
ment cf California and Nevada. The af
fair is to be notable for two reasons, the
chief of which is the visit of 1 the Presi
dent of the United States and the second,
that a larger attendance than ever be
fore is expected. Many posts will not only
send delegates, but will attend in a body,
and some veterans' organizations' that
have never beeii represented at a depart
ment encampment on this coast will send
delegations. The accommodations of Â» both
this city and Monterey, it is expected, will
be taxed to the utmost during the last
two days â the days on which President
McKinley will be present.
Some radical changes in the programme
have been made, notably the abolishment
of that supposedly necessary accompani
ment to all fraternal gatherings of tho
kindâ a parade. It was first intended to
have a military and civic parade, with
floats and floral carriages, and the Presi
dent was to have reviewed this pageant.
Owing to the difficulty in choosing a time
at once agreeable to the President and
convenient to the participating organiza
tions. It was decided to abandon' this fea
ture entirely.
The present programme is that Troop
C, National Guard of California, of Sa
linas will g<Â£ to Hotel del Monte on the
afternoon of the 11th, meet the Presiden
tial party and act as escort of honor to
Pacific Groye. Here a deputation of vet
erans will escort President McKinley into
the Assemblv Hall, where a closed ses
sion of the veterans will be held. After
ward the President will appear on the
balcony of El Carmelo Hotel and say a
few words to the assembled people. '
The remainder of the four days' pro
gramme will not be changed, except in
minor details.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 19.-Sy
brant Wessellus of this city, a member
of the executive committee of the Ameri
can Transvaal League, to-day received
the following letter from Montagu White,
American representative of the Trans
vaal :
NEW YORK CITY. April IS.â Dear Sir: In
reply to your inquiry as to 'the rumors about
President Kruger and Mr. Wolmarena counsel
ing surrender. I bee to inform you that thero
is absolutely no foundation for such ridiculous
reports.
Both the President and Mr. "Wblmarena, as
well as, the other advisers In Europe, are
strongly opposed to any settlement involving
a surrender of liberty or independence. Still
less would they counsel surrender, because time
is the very essence of the situation.
Reports from General Botha and the other
fighting generals as late as the beginning of
February were encouraging, and Indicate that
unless a settlement Is effected the war will be
of long continuance. Even the special cor
respondent of the London Times estimates that
it will last another year. The burghers arÂ«
carefully husbanding their ammunition, of
which they still have a generous eupply, and
there is no dearth of food, while the men in
the field are by this time almost seasoned
veterans.
Spirit of Determination.
The spirit of determination to continue ths
struggle is indomitable. With regard to the
objection urged by some friends that further
demonstrations in favor of the Boers are use
less because they achieve no definite result.
I beg- to protest most strongly against such an
assumption, because I am quite convinced that
the indirect effects of such demonstrations ars
beneficial to the Boer cause. They are also
a source of disquietude to the British and all
tend to influence the public mind in the direc
tion of ending the war. It is, however, neces
sary that due publicity should be given to such
meetings.
I cannot too strongly urgÂ» our friends to
treat the various rumors detrimental to tho
Boer cause with suspicion. The absurd reports
about Dewet going insane and the Boers be
ing hopeless should be dismissed at once.
Yours faithfully. MONTAGU "WHITE.

Lieutenant Generals Brackenbury "and
Clarke were appointed Knights of the

Treatment of Buller.
The Daily Express, in the course of an
editorial on the military honors and pro
motions, complains that Sid Redvera Bul
ler has been treated with marked Injus
tice, adding:
"It is said that Lord Roberts strove
hard to secure more proper recognition
for him, but Mr. Broderick resolutely re
fused to admit that General Buller had
any claims."
All the morning papers express grati
fication at the ample share awarded to
the colonials in the military honors.
The Sun yesterday, confirming the re
port that the peace negotiations between
Lord Kitchener and the Boer generals
have been renewed, suggests that some
thing is likely to be effected during Sir
Alfred Milner's absence. The paper also
says the Government Is divided as to who
will fill Sir Alfred fclilner's place. Mrs.
Botha Is again acting as a go-between.

new taxes imposed to meet the heavy
charges growing out of tho Boer war. may
prove beneficial to American exporters.
It -Is not believed that the import duty
to be imposed on sugar will affect trade
between the United States and the United
Kingdom in any way. Experts of the
Treasury Department, however, believe
that the United States will profit to some
degree by the imposition of an export
duty of one shilling per ton Â¦ on coal
shipped out of the United Kingdom.
Products of the American coal mines have
been gradually making their way into new
markets for several years past, and it is
believed that in many places the present
margin of cost In favor of British coal as
against that from America is less than
one shilling per ton, and that the imposi
tion of this tax, with the consequenc in
crease In the cost of British coal, will lead
consumers to buy- American coal. The
largest increase is expected in those mar
kets which are relatively nearer to the
United States than to Great Britain, but
some increase may be expected in exports
to Continental Europe.
Tendency Toward Protection.
â¢ Tho imposition of- an import tariff on
sugars with a differential of two shillings
and two pence between refined sugar and
sugars testing 76 degrees is looked upon
here as a step in the direction of protec
tion, as It Is believed that this differ
ential is. great enough to afford consid
erable encouragement to British refiners.
This may lead to a reduction in imports
of refined sugar into the United Kingdom,
but as refined sugar Is not an article of
export from the United States American
trade will not be affected by this. The
United Kingdom took from the United
States last year ' 202,366,855 pounds of glu
cose, 2,874,606 gallons of molasses and
8,279,241 gallons of syrup. It is hot*be
lieved that the trade in these articlesrsvill
be affected materially by the tax. ?
'Secretary of the Treasury Gage Is not
disposed to believe that the new taxes
will affect American trade with the
United Kingdom to any material degree.
He doubts whether the export duty on
coal is large enough to give American
coal any great advantage in competing
markets.
War Loan Measure Passes.
LONDON, April 19.â The House of Com
mons adopted the war loan resolution by
a vote of 186 to 117. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer,' Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, In
the House to-day confirmed the report
that he was considering exempting from
duty all coal contracts made prior to
April 18. A committee of the Cobden Club
met to-night and. resolved to open agita
tion against the sugar and coal taxes.
Replying' to a deputation of members
representing the coal r interests, Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach consented to an ar
rangement enabling the coal exporters to
execute contracts, pending a decision as
to what amount of the, duties would be
refunded. The executive council of the
Mining Association of Great Britain, rep
resenting all the colliery districts in the
United Kingdom, has unanimously passed
a resolution to the effect that the new ex
port duty on coal will most seriously in

that It will react seriously to. the preju

Walter R, Welch, the Fish
and Game Warden of Santa
Cruz County, Writes Re
garding Angling Conditions
Walter R. Welch, Fish and Game War
den of Santa Cruz County, writes an in
teresting letter about fishing in his vicin
ity. â¢ He says: " ." 'Â¦ ' -. .
"Trout fishing in . the < streams is very
good now. ; The trout are taking the fly
well. I got some very nice ones in Soqus!
last Friday on midget files and there. nas
been several very .good catches; made in
the streams here. "I, lost two Wilson
spoons to-day on large 'fish in Socruel.' I
saw 'a great many nice trout in the Sail
Lorenzo . River a few Jays ago rising to
the fly, but I was not equipped and 'diÂ«l
not try for them. I am sure good baskets
can be made there and in the Soquel. The
water is very clear and it rectuires care
ful fishing and small flies. I have' been
using Nos;' 14 and" 16. ' Some -very nice
baskets of trout -of good size have been
brought in from '.Warden, and Scott
Creeks., I have net been over there myself
since the season opened, but I understand
the water is in good shape.- There is no
reason ' why a Â¦ careful angler should I not
make good catches from. Â¦ any of - these
streams in a day. ' ,
bert E. Law from lapsing, an association
of yacht' owners will.be formed to hold
races for the cups.
- "I caught many handsome trout in ona
hour from the time I left the house and
returned. Sunday is a ba<3 day, in any
of the streams like tbe Soauel, as there
are so many people on them, the crowd
disturbs the stream, so that one can not
take many fish with ** fiv."
g Messrs. Vogelsang, 'iould and Dr. Ver
non went to the MeClor.d on Thursday
last and will return on Monday. They will
fish in the vicinity of Baird ' . " .
The Fisli Commission reports from their
spawning stations show 580,000 eggs at
Bird Eye, 450,000 at T.ihoe, and about 500,
000 at Cottonwood and Shovsl Creek. â¢ The
eggs taken at these stations will be
hatched and the fish distributed in pub
lic streams, beginning in August.
â¢ There . were about twe:itv-three . or
twenty-four : boat3 out in the slousfa on
High street, Alameda. Jast Sunday, but
few catches of bass were reDorted. This
was very disappointing because "A. W.
Wilson had taken fifteen on Thursday
last and seven on Frlda'%
The supply of stripod bass in the mar
kets is In excess of any previous time at
this season of the vear. The fish are
coming from, all points, showing that they
are. very generally- distributed and the
prospects of fishing are veiy good at all
points. . .
At 9 o'clock this morning on the courts
of the California Lawn Tennis Club, at
Bush and Scott streets, the annual inter
collegiate tennis tournament will be play
ed. Three menâ Harry Wiehe, Dick Ad
ams and William Rothâ will represent the
cardinal, while the blue and gold will
have but two representatives to whom
It will pin its faith. Paul Selby and Drum
mond McGavin will represent California
in both singles and doubles. All five plav
ers are experienced men, having put in
many years on the courts. Wiehe. Adams
and McGavin received their tennis educa
tion at the California Tennis Club of
which organization they have been ac
tive members for at least five years. Paul
Selby has played for about ten vears,
but most of his practice has been* done
across the bay. William Roth of Hono
lulu has had less experience than any of
the other men, but has played a great
deal in the islands, where he was once
champion in singles.
It has been definitely decided that Selby
will play Wiehe Instead of Roth, and the
latter will be pitted against McGavin.
This arrangement is more satisfactory in
fvery way. as both singles events will be
very close. Had the matches ' remained
as they were at first each college would
have undoubtedly won a singles match,
and thus the only real match of the day
would have been the doubles. " â¢" Â¦ Â¦ " - "
The. match between Wiehe and Selby
will be the most important of the day, as
they are the two best players of the five.
The Question of supremacy between these
two will at least be settled. The odds are
slightly in favor of Wiehe.
The match between Roth pnd McGavin
will be very close and it -would be a diffi
cult matter to say who will win. In dou
bles Wiehe and Adams are slight favor
ites, owing, to. their superior team work
Wiehe is a tower of strength in doubles
Stanford has been the victor in the last
two intercollegiate meets and seems to
have a slight advantage this year.
COLLEGE MEN OUT
FOR TENNIS HONORS
Bench Show Notes.
The San Francisco Kennel Club office
at 14 Post street already begins to take
on the similitude of dogdom by reason of
the many inquiries which are made by
prospective exhibitors, many of whom
bring their pets with them for the judg
ment of Clerk Laidlaw. Indications are
that the non-sporting classes will be by
far the largest and finest ever shown in
San Francisco.
Charles K. Harley is to show a kennel
of fox terriers, in which will be his no
table winner. Klickitat.
Secretary Norman announces that In
the cocker spaniel class the weight limit
has been increased to twenty-eight
pounds, with the exception that the spe
cial prizes offered by the California
Cocker Club for competition by mem
bers only will be for cocker dogs of tho
maximum weight of twenty-four pounds.
The action of the kennel club in offer
ing â¢ substantial money prizes to grey
hound exhibitors has enlisted the active
Interest of the Cauifornia coursing com
mittee, which is gathering a fine lot of
greyhounds.
Al Cooney Is "to show his Scotch colllia
Border Laddie, which won a reconfl in
Glasgow and was then brought to Amer
ica by Mrs. Hearst.
For the greyhounds the kennel club
has hung up in champion classes $23 to
first and $15 to second: for saplings. S8
to first and $4 to second: junior class,
12 to 18 months old. ?S to first and %\ to
second. Â¦^â¢' â¢
A new class for wire-haired fox ter
riers has been added for novices of either
sex medals to go to winners of first and
second and diplomas to third place ani
mals. Fifteen wire-haired fox terriers
have already been offered.
A special prize oÂ« $20 will be given to
the handler bringing the largest number
of entries over twenty-five outside of SaM
Francisco and Alameda counties.
Glenwoon Kennel has recently brought
several bull terriers from Newmarket
Kennels. Canada, and wll.show one of
them, Newmarket Queen.
The success of the recent Seattle dog
show, which had 215 dogs benched, indi
cates a degree of Interest that augurs
well for the San Francisco exhibition.
Several descendants of W. S. Klttle's fa
mous English setter Luke will be benched
together, and will form an interesting
study for students of form In dogs.

High-Class Stakes at Home
Bring Out Fairer Trials
Than the Big 'Events orv
England's Coursing Fields
The California Coursing Committee has
made an important ruling regarding
coursing partnership and the guarding of
degs entered in stakes under a firm name
or kennel designation. The board , points
out that coursing privileges under kennel
designation do not permit. guarding except
where the dogs are the bona fide property
of the same nopiinator.- â¢ *
In registering the name of the owner
must appear as an individual or a part
rership, and not as a kennel designation.
The full names of parties comprising a
co-partnership must be filed with the sec
retary of the committee within thirty
days from last meeting, and a $10 fee paid
for certificate oi co-partnership. 5*Â»
All partnerships hereafter formed must
be submitted to the committee for ap
proval and subjected to a $50 fee If cours
ing privilege Is granted.
Final action has been taken in the mat
ter of the application for registration of.
a litter of puppies by Dudley Diamond,
out of Koolawn; the committee refusing
to grant the registration. . . , .
According to Vir.dex, a noted authority
of England, the- average course Jn high
class event3 in that country does not
last forty seconds. This re-sult is reached
by figuring the performances in the
Waterloo Cup event. In thi3 event the
hares' are of the best class and are con
ditioned for the affair. Taking our John
Grace Cud stake as a standard courses
in the local big events reach a full min
ute. . In the last running of the season's
best event at Union Park runs of two
minutes or more which called for relief
dogs were of irequent occurrence. "With
a lively lot of picked jacks strong enough
to go a hard' journey the local coursers,
it will seem, have to do considerable
more work in landing a stake, and in con
sequence the followers of the game at
home witness better tests and fairer
trials of coursing than do the leashmen
across the water.
From statistics compiled by B. F. S.
Mulcaster of England for the season
IPOO-Cl, the list of the best greyhound
sires and their puppies Is headed by Gal
lant, Fabulous Fortune second and Under
the Globe third, both close competitors.
Gallant is the sire of Red Angus, George
Van Bergen's importation that succumbed
after a hard event last year at Union
Park. Fabulous Fortune Is the sire of
Fiery Face, now performing here, and
Under the Globe is a brother of Gobbo,
the sire of Fine Form, D. J. Healey's pur
chase from, abroad.
The out-of-town coursing meetings of
.last week resulted as follows:
"Vail* joâ P. Brophy's Benicia Boy won.
Russell & Allen's Faithful Lad runner up.
San Joseâ E. McAndrew's Gov. Mac first,
C. Sullivan (names) Alex second. Los
Angelesâ F. A. McComh's Crawford Lass
and Frosty Morn divided first and second
money. Sacramento â Walsh & Heenan's
Sacramento Boy. beat- H. B. Robbins'
Dixon Boy in the final. The winner In
this event has lost the last flag but once>
this season. Hot weather being on. Stock
ton is out of the game for the season, and
for the same reason Sacramento will close
after two more meetings.
P. E. Farns worth, secretary of the Cap
ital City Coursing Club of Sacramento is
in town. He attended the meeting of the
California Committee in the Interest of
the game at his home.- .
Union Park offers a great card for this
week's attraction. An open stake of 112
entries, with good talent on the list, and
a 16-dog champion event make up the
programme. In the latter affair the top
notch performers of America will furnish
the sport. Palo Alto and Beacon," both
well fixed for backers, are' in the bunch
of crackajacks, and that means a great
event if they meet. Jimmy Anthony, the
hound hailed as champion of Port 'Costa
and Vallejo, is an outside chance for final
honors and a dangerous one. It has been
said that -the dog has had desires to ease
up after a course. or two, but his recent
performances have left a more favorable
Impression, and now, it Is claimed, he im
proves as he gets along in the stake. A
contingent from the. up-river towns will
come by special train to boost the courser
on his way to victory.
LOCAL HOUNDS
ARE FORCED TO
SEVERE TESTS
There will be a gay time at Tiburon to
day. The Corinthian Yacht Club will open
the season at its quarters on Valentines
Island v-ith. a reception to ladies from 2
to 6 p. m., at which there will be music
and dancing. 'Â±ne owners of yachts moor
ed in the cove have been requested to
dress shin in honor of the fair guests.
During the afternoon the small boats will
be kept busy carrying the ladles from the
clubhouse to me yachts! The ladles will
return to the city by the boat leaving
Tiburon at 5:40 p.m.. and at 7 o'clock the
last installment of Corinthians from San
Francisco will reach the Marin shore.
Chowder, beans, coffee and the other com
ponents of a Corinthian supper will be In
readiness and all will set to with a will.
After supper there will be a jinks in the
hall for members and a few special guapts.
A beat leaving Tiburon about midnight
will bring some of the Corinthians back
to the city, but many others will sleep on
board the yachts In readineÂ£3 for the
opening cruise to-morrow.
The reception committee in the after
noon consists of Commodore H. D. Hawks,
Vice Commodore E. F. Sagar, Secretary
J. C. Brickell. Treasurer C. L. Barrett,
ex-Commodore J. W. Pew and Director
Thomas Jennings. E. S. Enamons will be
floor imanager and will be assisted by
J. A. Laver.saler, Stewart M. Anderson,
E. J. Bov.-es, P.. H. Morrow and S. M.
Crim. The committee in charpre of the
evening jinks consists of E. F. Sagar,
chairman; Frank W. Thompson, L. W.
Harles, E. J. Angelo, Walter Howe and
J. V. O'Brien. The. committee has pre
pared an excellent minstrel show, in Â¦which
will be seen" C. Morel, D. M. Laughlin. R.
B. Mitchell. W. Hynes. "Ossle" Franks,
E. J. Ang-elo, Signor Abramoff and other
well-known entertainers; I also the Edna
Quartet and an orchestra of five pieces
under the direction of Maurice Cramer.
To-morrow morning -the yachts will
make colors at 8 o'clock, and owners will
report at 10 on board the flagship May
for instructions from Commodore H. . D.
Hawks. The fleet will cruise in squadron,
starting at 11 o'clock. A good dial of
hard work has been accomplished during
the past three weeks â¢ in preparing for
opening dav, and as a result nearly all
the yachts of the fleet are ready to make
sail. .
Ex-Commodore Carl Westerfeld has ap
parently given up the idea of trying to
annex any more racing trophies, for the
sail area of the sloop Aeolus, winner of
three Macdonough cups and of the Per
petual Challenge Cup, has been reduced
and her spars shortened. This will dimin
ish her speed, but will make her a more
comfortable cruising boat. The sloops
Embla and Clara have not yet been able
to so up on the ways, but will be taken
up as soon as possible. The sloops Tru
ant, Freda, Edna. Mist, Sappho, Queen,
Seven tsells and several others are ready.
The Corinthians as they have become
prosperous are departing somewhat from
â¢the simplicity of earlier days, for four
of the yachts will carry hired men this
season â the sloops Sappho. Â¦ Clara and
Queen and the yawl Seven Bells. The
yawl Arcturus Is still in the lagoon, as
her owner. ex-Director W. S. Grover, does
not intend to sail this year and- has not
succeeded in selling- or chartering her.
The sloop Mischief is over at Sausallto
being put into commission and will sail
from that nort," though she is also en
rolled in the Corinthian fleet and will be
entered in the races both of the San Fran
cisco ar.d Corinthian clubs.
Next Saturday. April 27. the San Fran
ti&co Yacht- Club will open the season at
f-ausalito. Instead of a dance in the even
ing a jinks will be -given in the main hall
of. the clubhouse, the entertainment be
ing In' charge of a committee of five. A
handsome souvenir programme is being
prepared. On the following day the open
ing cruise by signal from Commodore W.'
K. McCarthy's schooner Ramona will take
place. 'Â¦'
Though 4t seems practically certain that
the Pacific .Interclub Yacht Association
will not be able to maintain' Its exist
ence, the Corinthians have selected dele
gates, who are ex-Commodore T. F.
Tracy, T. J. Kavanaush and Orlo East

association, it cannot be maintained by

fair sex, which will be given its first
opportunity to see a wrestling tourna

way of Olympic ladles' nights, and judg

A big attendance is assured. That the
athletic end of the entertalnemnt will
prove such a complete success seems to
be an equal certainty, for from the many

COMMENT AND
FACTS ON LOCAL
SPORT EVENTS
McGovern and Gardner Fight.
Baseball Situation-Busy
Day for College Athletes
on the California Track
Without a doubt Terry McGovern is in
the very pupil of the local sporting pub
lic eye. He is to-day the leading pugi
listic character of this country, and he is
an uncommon premier, too. even in the
gallery of fistic big ones. On the evening
of April 30 he will fight Oscar Gardner,
the man whom he has sent to the floor
aÂ«= one of many. After that, should he
win, he will talk of a match with Erne.
On all sides the persistent rumors of a
Fhady fight between McGovern and Gard
ner assail the ear. No one knows just
where the source of these reports is
placed. One thing is certain. McGovern
has gone Into active and earnest training
and so 'has Gardner. In their former
fipht Gardner gave McGovern something
of an argument and made Terry work to
put on the finishing touches.. Gardner
may have "gone back." as has been said
of him. but at any rate it is not likely
that McGovern would fake a fight for the
loser's end. He is in the very zenith of
his- pugilistic glory, his fighting strength
has rot been sapped by vicious excesses
and he is to-day a big money earner. His
great difficulty, the besetting trouble of
his occupation, is to find new subjects on
which to train his blows. His. class, the
feather-weight, is a limited one for ex
ceptionally good men. and Terry, in or
der to satisfy the public, must step with
out the bounds for further effort. The
public takes it for granted" that every
feather-weight that was, is or will be is
not the man for a match with this same
McGovern. There is hardly an idea afloat
that McGovern would fakeâ rather, that
the other man is no match for himâ and
that the contest will on that account be
nothing- but one-sided.
Harris, who manages McGovern, has
certainly been solicitous of McGovern's
champion status and has secured the best
porsible terms for the Terrible Teddy.
The feather-weight on the day of his ar
rival expressed several hopes and desires
for a few extra pounds. He said that it
this climate should prove agreeable to his
physical disposition and that if he took on
weight he would agree to fight Erne at
J"3. Harris, who regulates all of Mc-
Gcvern's business, was not so committal.
He readily premised Erne a return match,
but with the proviso that he must wait
until after the Gardiner match before any
consideration of the adjustment of
weights.
â¢ * â¢
AH the four baseball clubs of the league
have played in this city, and the fanatics
are drawing conclusions. Unless condi
tions change radically the fight should be
between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
At present Oakland is in second place,
hut the Dudesâ who, by the way. are
dudes no longerâ are not stickmen. They
have a good out and in field, some strong
pitchers and a good backstop. When it
comes to the hitting end of it Oakland
seems lamentably weak. Sacramento,
with the majority of its? former cliam
piens still wearing gilt trimmings, was
strong last year and the season before
because it had two very strong boxrnen,
ore of whom won three out of every four
frames he pitched. They are also good
stickers. This season the Senators will
havs to work for the banner. When the
local team settles and Henry Harris fixes
his men in steady positions and Pabst
learns how to stop a bouncing ball Tiiere
may be a surprise party or two thrust
upon the Angels, who give a show at the
present time of having the best of it.
The local team has among its number
some of the best batters in the league and
pood, capable fielders. A cloud of ill luck
s-eeins to hover regularly over the local
nine early in the season. It takes them
a month to get away in the race. Plague
scared baseball players and untrained
substitutes have hampered the Wasps up
to date.

This will be a big day for California's
two universities. On the Berkeley campus
this afternoon the annual Intercollegiate
field day will be run and jumped to a con
clusion. Since 1S93. the date of the first
meeting between California and Stanford
on the track and field, California has de
feated Stanford every year, with a oir.gle
exception, ar.d then the games resulted In
a tie. This year a closer meet is expect
ed, yet the prevailing opinion is that Cali
fornia will win again. There are tome
first class performers in several of the
events, and a record or two may go to
pieces. The fact tl-at the baseball series
rezids one victory for Stanford and the
same for California will add zest to the
Kamt-s to-day on the Berkeley track. On
the California Tennis Club's courts this
morning the two colleges will fight for
the annual championship in tennis.

AMONG the mementoes on the card
for the last day of sport at Tan
foran Park under the manage
ment of the San Francisco Jockey
Club was a mile and a sixteenth
racing. conceit arranged for gentlemen
riders, each to carry 160 pounds. Free
Lar:ce, with Harry Stover, the owner of
Kenllworth, in the saddle, enjoyed first
call in -the ring at odds of 6 to 5, with
Catastrophe, the mount of Patrol Judge
George Parsons, ne^jt in demand. "Sam"
Hildreth rode his own horse, Filon d'Or,
carrying five pounds overweight. Rio
Chico had as pilot Lieutenant von Polenz
of the German army, and his military seat
in the saddle was much admired even if
ho did: not finish among ! the j first three.
The riders had to stand for considerable
joshing from the paddock crowd, espe
cially Sam Hildreth, who called for an
other bracer Just as bugle call sounded.
Between the later rider and Harry Stover
a side wager of a suit of clothes existed,
and the pair tried some old-time jockey
ing. Filon d'Or started out to make the
pace,' but held the lead only a short time.
Before the half was reached George Par
sons had Catastrophe in frefit and won
hands down at the wire. When the situa
tion lookedticklish Hildreth tried to carry
Stover's mount'out into the onion patch,
but Stover was foxy. Taking Free Lance
up. he dropped on the inside of Filon d'Or
and in a hard drive got the place by a
head. Rio Chico stopped to nothing with
thfÂ» lieutenant. . 'â¢ .
None of the starters in the different
events were afflicted with any great
amount of class, and the attendance was
not large. Favorites attached themselves
to three of the purses. . : : , .
â¢ An even-money favorite, Valenclenne,
won the opening sprint In an ordinary gal
lop. Mounce let the mare step out In
front at. the start, and at the wire she
finished four lengths ahead of Saul of
Tarsus. Katie Walcott, a 15 to 1 outsider,
ran third.
The four furlong dash for two-year-olds
that had never started kept the crowd
guessing. Ed Lanigan's filly, St. Philip
pine, was installed-favorite, and though
she displayed a neat turn of speed was
beaten by the second choice. Coal Oil
Johnny, with Nash Turner in the saddle.
Show honors fell to Jacqueminot. - â¢
It looked such a close thing between
Princess Tftania and Rollick that in the
betting on the seven furlong run it was 6
to 5 and take your pick around post time.
Dominick on the Princess got his mount
away first, and leading to the end lasted
just long enough to get the verdict by a
head. Compass at 50 to 1 ran third. Sub
lime broke down.
Wyoming, : Parmenion and Merops fin
ished noses on the wire In the order
named at the conclusion of the mile and
a furlong event. The first named horse,
ridden by Charley Thorpe, ruled an even
money chance, and after a series of mis
haps got up > just In time to receive the
verdict. Einstein came in for some back
ing and led for six furlongs before blow
ing up. Â¦
. One of the stoutest tips permeating the
air- was one on Sugden to win the final
mile run. Hazard had the leg up, and at
odds of ifo to 1 made all the running and
won easily from Estro. Facade, the fa
vorite,' made no showing whatever.

"Ths new line to Denver will add greatly

"I do not think that counsel has under
stood this case," said ludee Ilayne in his
argument in the water rate.trial to-day.
"I do not want to cast aspersions on the
eminent Bentlemen encaged v on the other
side, but it seems to me that they havo
utterly failed to grasp the significanca
of the fact that while a supply of seventy
gallons per capita is ample for San Fran
cisco they contend thai Oakland must
have from 160 to 190 gallons daily per capi
ta. They may contend that Oakland is a
city of lawns, but as an offset San Fran
cisco has more stringent sanitary â¢ regu
lations. We have here the uncontradicted
testimony of one expert anote'er
that seventy-five gallon? per capita is an.
abundant supply of water for this city.
Why have our opponents nesrlected to
challenge this evidence? It is obvious
that if Oakland is using 190 or even lad
gallons per capita pÂ«r day there Is an
enormous waste. Kurtocrmore, we have
expert testimony hero tfc:ii â¢ this Â¦ wasto,
which the plaintiff claims as a Justifica
tion for its superfluous provisions for sup
plying water, is eas'.ly preventable by
various means." >Â«*-~

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April
19.â With the ninth annual inter
collegiate field and track meet but
a day distant the Cardinal team is
; In a far from satisfactory condi
tion. The two fastest sprinters among the
Cardinal squad are both off color, one on
account of a split tendon, the other con
fined to his bed with the grip.
J.'C. McCaughern, who won the intercol
legiate lflO-yard dash last year over Drum
and Cadogan is the man with the out-of
gear tendon. Though he will enter the
short sprint, it Is doubtful whether his
unfirm muscle will allow him to finish his
race. Lamb Is the man with the grip.
Early in the week he covered the 220-yard
stretch alone in 23 seconds, under a slow
finish. Had he been in condition for the
meet, his race with Cadogan would cer
tainly have smashed the intercollegiate
record.
Even with these two men out of the
short sprints, Stanford will have a fast
trio in Hamilton, Bubb and Stewart.
Henley, the star- freshman from Ukiah,
is in good condition, but inasmuch as he
has been training for ; three events, he
cannot be expected to equal his record in
either one. It is likely that he will not
enter the pole vault, saving his strength
for the two Jumps. Should he be able to
duplicate his best records to-morrow, he
should take two firsts for the Cardinals.
Hamilton, Sprague and Chadbourne
should make good time in the mile, but
cannot hope to outdistance Service of Cal
ifornia. In the pole vault Stanford ex
pects to take all three places with Dole,
Beach and Foster or Henley, all four of
whom can clear ten feet.
The Palo Alto boys will be weakest in
the two hurdle, races and with the
weights. Brooke, the best man with the
hammer, cannot tots the sphere over 130
feet. Taylor, a freshman, takes the high
hurdles well for a novice and may prove a
surprise to-morrow. He has plenty of
speed, but lacks form. Stanford should
take five firsts at least, ard with a "sur
prise" or two may take more. The fact
that her men are worthy freshmen ma
terial leaves the element of chance a very
large one.
BERKELEY. April 19.â Whatever hap
pens at the intercollegiate field day to
morrow, . California expects to win. The
athletes themselves are confident, but
they fully realize that their very best ex
ertions must be put forth. <â¢
California men who have kept a close
watch on the Stanford and Berkeley
teams place the score some twenty points
in Berkeley's favor. This reckoning, al
though considered conservative by local
enthusiasts, will not admit of any mis
takes or unlocked for occurrences on the
part of the State University squad.
Trainer Walter Christie said: "We look
forward to a close- contest. From what I
have heard of the Stanford men and know
of our men, we may expect good work
from both teams. For the results we
await the conclusion of the field day."
Track Captain Walsh's general summary
of the events is as follows:
Cadogan should win the 100-yard dash if
his leg is all right. Brown (California) and
McCaughern (Stanford) will run close for
second. Cadogan and Lamb of Stanford
will run a close race in the '220-yard dash.
Squires should win the 440-yard dash with
Smith of Stanford and Asbill of California
for second place. Service is generally con
ceded both distance runs. Chadbourne
(Stanford) and Clifford (California) are
probable seconds in the &80-yard run, while
Chadbourne will havp Woods and Rede
will of Berkeley against him as likely
men for second honors in the mile run.
"With California's bunch of high hurdlers
all three places should go to her. Thomas
ought to win by a small margin from eith
er Powell, Hamlin or Cheek. In the low
hurdles two places should go to^Berke
ley.* Powell or Cheek ought to win.
Cooley and Powell will give Henley of
Stanford a close contest for first in the
high jump. Henley is expected to win,
but the two Blue and Gold men have been
doing good work recently. In the broad
jump Henley and Hussey (California) will
struggle for first. The contest will be close,
with Henley the' probable winner. -Stan
ford will get fint and second places in the
pole vault, giving Dudon of California a
fighting chance for third. Duden may
prove a surprise, but points are not reck
oned on from him. â¢ - . .
Plaw will get both . weights. Woolsey
stands a good chance of 'winning -second
for California in the shot-put. Second in
the hammer throw is doubtful. . â¢
The Berkeley athletes are not worrying
over the result3 of the mile walk. Captain
Walsh is picked as a winner. Zschokke of
Stanford has a splendid reputation as a
walker. .Walsh himself believes he will
have to do the pace of his life to win.-.
BERKELEY. April 19.â The following
officials have been chosen for the Stan
ford-California field day to be held to
morrow afternoon on the Berkeley oval:

CALIFORNIA ATHLETES CONFIDENT

Track and Field Men of Both Universities Ready
for the Annual Intercollegiate Games
Jack Sheridan, one of the best and most
capable baseball umpires of America, is
insane, according to Eastern dispatches.
He is now in confinement in Chicago.
Sheridan had a national reputation on
the ball field. His first big success as
an umpire was in this city, in the days
of the old California League. He then
went East, receiving a handsome offer
from the National League. At the time
the American League was organized
Sheridan became the premier umpire
and remained under Its banners.
Sheridan wintered here this year, and
was on his way East to take up his offi
cial work in the league. As an umpire
he had the respect of both ball players
arid the public. His decisions were at all
times fair and his Judgment quick and
speedily announced.

TRAP SHOOTING FOR
THE ENTIRE SEASON
NEW YORK, April 19.-The great chess
event of the year, the fixth international
c-ble match between America and Great
Britain for the possession of the Newnes
trophy, was begun to-day under the aus
pices of the Brooklyn and British chess
clubs.
A large and enthusiastic crowd was in
during the entire day at the
Academy of Music assembly rooms,
Brooklyn, where the American end of the
Tontest is being waged.
At 9 o'clock lots "were drawn for first
move, and as the Americans won the
toss they selected to play the white on
the odd-numbered boards. Following is
the pairing together with the openings
adopted on the ten boards:
American. Grep.t Britain. Opening.
1â Pillsbury Blackburn Sicilian
2â Showalter Mason Irregular
S-Barry Lee .Caro-Kann
4â Hodges Mill!" Ruy Lopez
pâ Hyn.es Atkins Ruy Lopez
<".â Volght Bellingham Sicilian
7â Marshall Ward Q Gambit Dec
fcâ Bampton Jacicson Giuoco Piano
Sâ Newman Jacobs Dutch
10â Howcl! Mitchell Q Gambit Dec
Plllsbury, in the course of his Sicilian
defense adopted by Blackburn, offered to
sacrifice his pawn, which the wily Eng
lishman did not deem prudent to cut.
Eventually the American was graining
ground. Showalter defended himself
with a king's finchetto against Mason.
The latter failed to maintain the advan
tage gained in the opening, and the po
sition is fairly even now. Harry had the
superior game against Lee throughout
the day.
A lot of fine maneuvering characterized
the Ruy L,opez between Mills and Hodges.
The American held his own very well,
and was not slow in accumulating- slight
advantages which ought to insure him to
draw, to say the least Less favorable
Is the aspect presented by board No. 5.
In the morning Hymes had a. fine fame
ssrainst Atkins, but after recess thu po
sition turned in favor of the Englishman,
although there is plenty of fight left to
determine the issue. The most promis
ing: outlook affords at board No. 7. where
Marshall, after pulling out of a bad po-
Fition. wen a pawn from Ward. The re
maining games are about even, that on
No. 10 being a shade in favor of the
American player.
Play ivill be resumed to-morrow.

If the report be true that Kaiser William is writing

Buffalo is promising to break all exposition records'
uy having the Pan-American fully prepared. for vis
itors on the day it opens; but it is said. at the same
time that visitors will be admitted before the "formal"
opening, so there appears to be some uncertainty
about the meaning of the promise.
Ever since the death ct Victoria the Londoners have
been trying to raise about $1,000,000 to erect a
memorial to her Majesty, but have not yet succeeded;
while in Baltimore a sum in excess of that amount
rt-25 raised in about two weeks for the purpose of
endowing Johns Hopkins University. That is the dif
ference between Americans and the British in the way
of carrying out a movement when they get started.
A signboard "dominating Niagara Falls" is exactly
the' kind of billboard nuisance needed to convince the
American people of the disgrace that attends a "com
munity-th'at'. tolerates ~such abominations. The for
eign'-visitor who turns aside from the exposition "to
lcok .at the ' greatest of ' the j natural wonders . of the
Eastern States and sees it dominated. by an advertising
signboard will, be apt to conclude that we are bar
barians, ignorant of every beauty of nature and of art,
and capable of nothing butthe excessive laudation of
quack medicines and. such other stuff. as needs adver
tising of that kind... . 'y . .' /.; . . - .
It would be a : regrettable thing if the scheme an
nounced be permitted to be carried but, but the re
suit might'be beneficial. Sooner or later the people
of all parts 'of 4 the United States must deal with the
billboard and advertising -poster . nuisance, and the
desecration of Niagara Falls during' the Buffalo ex
position would doubtless help to â¢ bring about: right
action on the subject.
â¢We learn from our Eastern exchanges that a cer
tain firm has sent "out a circular soliciting advertising
and announcing in great headlines: "The Biggest
Signboard on Earth. It Will Dominate Niagara Falls
and Be the Observed of All Observers at the'Pan-*
American Exposition." Descending to details, it an
nounces that the monstrosity will be thirty-seven feet
high and two hundred and eighty feet long, and a net
work of two miles of t .visted steel cables will be neces
sary to. keep it in position. It confidently makes the
further* assertion that it "will be so artistic a piece of
work as to thoroughly delight the millions of per
sons whose attention will be called to it."
The American people have borne the evil with pa
tience for a long tim*, but there is now a prospect
that they will have at the Buffalo exposition an object
lesson that will rouse them to take some adequate ac
tion toward suppressing it.
Of all. lands on earth the United States has
suffered most from that kind of nuisance; There is
hardly a jingle city whose streets are not defaced by
unsightly billboards r.nd flaring posters, and even
the country' has not escaped. The most beautiful
landscapes have been marred by them, and the scenery
of > historic, localities has been desecrated by their
hideous, presence.
UNSIGHTLY ADVERTISING.
UNSIGHTLY. advertising has long been one of
the nuisances of the age. i It has been carried to
such an extent that Jin every part of the world
protests have been made against it, and in all pro
gressive, communities where the people have any
artistic sense ordinances have been enacted either to
suppress it altogether or at least to so restrict it as
to eliminate some of its worst features.

In commenting upon the Connecticut figures the
Springfield Republican says: "The 'Massachusetts
vital statistics of Course reveal the same population
tendencies. Those for the year 1900 are not at hand,
but the statistics of 1899 will do as well; and in order
to show that the country districts do not differ ma
terially from the urban in this' particular the figures
are given for several Counties as -well as for the State :
In all cases. the native deaths outnumber the births,
and the births among'the foreign* born far exceed the
deaths', and this is as true of the three rural counties
as it is of the' county comprising the city of Boston."
In explanation of this difference between the birth
and death rates of natives and foreigners there are of
fered many reasons, the most plausible- of which' is
that the strong and robust young natives emigrate to
the West in large numbers, leaving behind them old
people and children, among whom the death .rate, is
naturally high, while the foreign element is made up
of comparatively young men and women in the full
vigor of life. Whatever value may be possessed by
I that explanation, the fact remains that in New Eng-
1 ARLY reports from the census recently taken in
Great Britain show that the complete enumera-
* tion will probably reveal that the country is no
longer making any considerable increase in popula
tion. In fact,' in the rural, districts, from which the
first reports have been given out, there has been a
decline in population since the previous census, and
unless the big cities show large gains the population
as a whole will be found to be stationary.
Such reports from Great Britain will not be sur
prising, nor will they justify a conclusion' that ttie
population is dying out, like that of -France, for it is
well known that the British Islarrds furnish every year
a large number of emigrants to. the colonies of -the
empire and to the United States. A more remark- 1
able fact. is disclosed in reports from New England
that the native population of that section, mainly^ de
scended from British stock, is "dying out, while the
foieign population. is increasing. The diminution of
tilt native stock is not due wholly .to. emigration ro
the West. It appears from statistics recently collected
that in many localities of those States the birth rate of
the old New England stock is actually less than the
death rate.
Vital statistics collected in Connecticut for last
year show that in forty-one country towns and vil
lages peopled almost wholly J)y ( natives the deaths for
the year exceeded the births by 240. For the whols
State the native births numbered 8299 and the deaths
10,388, and the foreign births 8219 and deaths only

The" magnificent display in the way of night decora
tion that was provided fc.-Â« the return of the California
Volunteers from the Philippines shows that in the way
of electrical illumination our streets can be made
glorious enough for any triumphal night. Such deco
rations, however, are of no value in the daytime, and
consequently they should be supplemented by exten
sive and artistic adornments of buildings, with the
bright colors of the national banner displayed at
every point of vantage. It will be remembered that
for the celebration of the return of the volunteers the
principal thoroughfares were decorated with 'ever
greens, and the effect was notably beautiful aud at
tractive. Now let us se: if we cannot surpass that ac
complishment. Each new achievement in San Fran
cisco should be better than anything of the kind" in
the past, and the welcome given to the President
should set a new mark ?r. the way of street decoration
that will be higher and better than any we have yet
known.
Upon a matter of this kind the citizens of San Fran
cisco should not heed n ; uch in the way of urging to
induce them to heartily co-operate with one another.
They should gladly unite in making the streets bril
liant and beautiful during the whole period of the
President's visit.
In their appeal the committee says: "This is the
first time in the history of our city that we will have
had the pleasure of enjoying the presence of the Presi
dent with his Cabinet and so many Government' offi
cials. The decorating committee will attend to the
illumination by- electric lights of some of the principal
Ftrcets of the city, but we rely upon the patriotism of
the residents of San Francisco to tastefully decorate
each his own premises and give our visitors Califor
nia's proverbially warm welcome. Let 'Old Glory/
the emblem of one of the greatest and most progres
sive nations on earth", wave from every housetop dur
ing Presidential week." , .
rROM the committee having in charge arrange
ments for decorating the city upon the occasion
of the coming visit of the President there has
been issued an earnest appeal to the citizens gener
ally to co-operate in xhz work. To that appeal prompt
attention and willing response should be given. The
time when the President is to arrive is riot so. far off.
?hat it is any too early to begin now to make prepara
tions for the suitable rulornment of the city.

WEIGHT OF GOLD AND SILVERâ S.
S., Giant, Cal. A friend of this depart
ment connected with the office of the
assi$tant United States Treasury of this
city states that the answer given some
time 3ince aa to the weight of a million
dollars of gold and of silver was practi
cally correct, but that the following is
the exact weight of each:
One gold dollar weighs 23. 8 grains: one pound
troy 15760 grains) would be worth $223.2S5S-r-;
one Dound avoirduDois (7000 grains) would ba
worth 1271.3178+ ; $1000 sold would weigh, avoir
dupois, 3.6S37H pounda; $1,000,000 gold would
weigh, SavolrduDOls. 36S5.714 rounds.
A simpler method of ascertaining ths weight
of $1,000,000 In gold coin In avoirdupois Weight
is: If $1 weighs 25.S grains, then $1,000,000
weighs 25,S0O,0UO grains, which at 7000 grains
to <he pound avoirdupois equals 36&.714 pounds.
Oce ailver dollar welsha 412.5 grains; one
pound troy (5760 grains) "would be worth
$13.!)636-Â»- ; one pound avoirdupois <7000 grains)
would be worth $16.9696+; $1000 would weigh
avoirdupois M.9235+ pounds; $1,000,000 would
weigh avoirdi>ois 58,028.574- pounds. Simpler
method: If $1 silver weighs 412.5 grains, then
Jl 000.000 would weigh 412,500,000 grains, which
at 7000 grains to the pound avolrdpola equals
53,323.57+ pound3. y

CALIFOBUTAITS IN NEW YORK.
In justice to the British Ministry it must be ad
mitted they have a difficult problem to deal with: The
returns of the past year, as the Chancellor pointed out
in his speech, render it certain that the tax upon tea,
tobacco, beer and liquors has reached the limit of
profitable taxation, qnd consequently ho additional
burden can be imposed upon those articles. The only
means by. which an increase of revenues can be at
tained is by augmenting the income tax and imposing
import duties upon certain articles, and export duties
upon coal. The Government has adopted those means,
but has at the same time tried to make a show of con
tinuing the policy of free trade. It remains to be
seen how the plan will suit the British taxpayer. The
only thing about it that is sure at this time is that
Great Britain has taken the first step toward- a return
to protection, and free trade has been virtually aban
doned in practice while -defended theoretically in the
home of its friends. Â¦. * " ; : . .' . .â¢ Â¦
If that be what is meant by "tariff for revenue only"
the workingmen of this country had better take no
tice of it. Such a tariff, according to the explanation
of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, means a
tax imposed upon workingmen so adjusted that manu
facturers are to escape its burden's. We once had an
administration in this country thai designed a tariff
for revenue only, and the results were disastrous.
There may now be another example of it presented
in Great Britain. Should Parliament approve the
budget and the tax be imposed the laboring classes of
the British public will have a chance to see how the
system works, and it would not be surprising if at the
next general elections they pronounce upon it- a ver
dict not dissimilar to that of American workingmen
upon the Wilson tariff.
It will be perceived that the first declaration that
the duty is not to be protective is followed by another
declaration that duties are'-to be imposed on foreign
manufactured articles coming intoCcompetition with
the home article, and, moreover, the manufacturers
are to-be allowed drawbacks on goods exported.
Such statements show that the- Ministry has laid' out
for itself a crooked policy. A' tax is to. be imposed
upon sugar, says the Chancellor, but it is not to' be a
protective duty; it is designed solely that the labor
ing classes may contribute a share of the public rev
enues; the manufacturer is to find compensation in
drawbacks upon exported goods, and is, moreover, to
have his interests safeguarded against foreign competi
tion.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, in presenting the estimates for the com
ing year made an earnest effort to avoid the issue, and
entered into elaborate explanations of the proposed!
increase of customs duties. In the course of his speech
he said: "The country has reached a point where it
is necessary to widen the scope of taxation. ' * Â¦ * *
I am not disposed to oppose a customs duty on manu
factured goods, as suggested by Sir Howard Vincent.
The average consumption of sugar is fifty-six pounds
per head. Sugar is taxed in every other country in
Europe and is taxed in the United States. In this
country. taxes remained upon sugar long after.the in
stitution of free trade. What I propose is not a pro
tective duty, but a public necessity j has Â¦ arisen for
some duty, of -which the laboring classes should pay
a fair share. * * * I do not believe the duty will
injure. manufacturers using sugar to anything like the
amount feared. Of course provision will be made for
imposing -a duty on manufactured articles from for
eign countries coming into competition with the home
article, and for allowing manufacturers a drawback
on articles which they export." â¢ ''
PUBLIC expectation concerning what the Brit
ish Ministry would do in the way of providing
revenues to meet the increased expenditures of
the Government was not far wrong in its forecast.
The prediction that there would be an increase of cus
toms duties has been realized to some extent, and the
issue between free trade and protection as a national
policy is fairly on. for pat tisan discussion. ?j

: Several systems for reporting and pub
lishing the 'proceedings of Congress and
for printing the documents and blanks far
Congress and the several executive de
partments.- were adopted, and upon trial,
found unsatisfactory before the present
system was established. The first Con
gress, which met In the city of New York,
had no official report of debates during
its sessions. During its second session, a
proposition to supply the members with
three copies each of a register of debates,"
made by the editor of a New Tork paper,
was voted down. In February, 1795, how
ever, a resolution offered by the Hon.
William Loughton Smith was passed, di
recting the Secretary of Sate to receive
proposals from stenographers for furnish Â¦
ing accurate reports of debates. In Ja'.i
uary, 17S6, David Robertson of Peters
burg, Va., was appointed official reporter
to Congress. His annual salary was
fixed at $4000, which sum was in full for
his services, clerk hire, stationery and all
incidental expenses. , If was provided,
however, that if he should ' furnish a
manuscript copy of his report to Andrew
Brown, printer of the Philadelphia Ga
zette, the last-named gentleman was re
quired to pay therefor $1100 of the Roberc
son salary, leaving only $2900 to be â¢ de
frayed from th,e Federal Treasury.
On October 31, 1800, Hamilton Smith
commenced the publication of the Na
tional Intelligencer, the seat of Govern
ment having been previously removed
from Philadelphia to Washington. Im
perfect reports of the debates in Con
gress were published in that journal. Mr.
Smith did his own reporting of debates,
and when his reports were written it was
his habit to send them to the several
gentlemen in either House who had taken
part in the discussions, and these gentle
men would revise their notes at their
leisure. Reporters were not at that time
permitted to occupy seats on the floor of
the Senate, and in 1802 Mr. Smith request
ed permission to occupy a position where
he could better listen to debates. Oppo
sition was made to this request, and
when those who objected found they were
in a minority they tried to provide that
reporters or "note-takers" should give
bond for their good behavior. This propo
sition was voted down, 16 to 12, and by a
similar vote the presiding officer of tho
Senate was authorized to allot a place
within the area of the chamber to any
stenographer or note-taker in his (the
presiding officer's) discretion. Joseph
Gales was employed as a stenographer in
the service of the Intelligencer in ISO.,
and in 1810 he purchased the interest of
Mr. Smith in that journal.
" Earliest Verbatim Reports.
Verbatim reports of proceedings in the
two branches of Congress were com
menced for the first time in December.
1833, in the Congressional Globe, published
by Messrs. .Blair & Rives.. The Globe was
at that time a weekly sheet, and con
tained simply a journal of the proceedings
and reports of such speeches as were
written by the members of the Senate or
House themselves.
In 1847 a contract was made with a Mr.
Houston, a stenographic reporter, to fur
nish daily verbatim reports of debates and
proceedings of the Senate for the press.
In August, 1846. Congress adopted a plan
for daily"- verbatim reports of debates in
each of the two houses of Congress. and
for their publication the succeeding
morning in two newspapers in the city of
Washington and subsequently in book
form. The contracts were subsequently
abandoned by the proprietors of both
journals and the work allotted to Mr.
John C. Rives, the debates to appear in
the Daily Globe, and subsequently in book
form.' In accordance with the provisions
of modified contracts, reports of Congres
sional debates were published In the
Globe until 1873. In March of that year
an act was passed by Congress providing
that the debates of Congress should be
printed by the Congressional printer, un
der the direction of the joint Committee
on Printing on the part of the Senate.
D. F Murphy was made official reporter
of the Senate, and the debates of Con
gress were published at the Government
Printing Office in the Congressional Rec
ord. The House of Representatives ap
proved of these arrangements, and, com
mencing with the Forty-third Congress,
the reports of debates have been published
in the Congressional Record from that
time to this.
Remarkable Speed of the Work. *
While the late Philetus Sawyer of Wis
consin was a'member of the -United States
Senate he : was one morning escorting a
member of the English House of Com
mons through the Capitol, when the lat
ter picked up a copy of the Congressional
Record, and, noticing the date of publi
cation, asked of what sessions of the two
houses of Congress the reports in the
Record were. The Senator answered that
ihev covered' all debates and other pro
ceedings of each house up to the time of
adjournment the preceding day. The
Englishman expressed his astonishment
at this information, saying reports of
Parliamentary debates were generally
thiee or four days behindhand in publi
cation.
When the fact is considered that each
page of the Record contains about 6000
cms of brevier type, or 10,000 ems of non
pareil type, the later embodying some
times many pages, of rule and figure work,
and that each issue of this publication
often , reaches as many as 100 pages of
solid matter, an accurate idea may be
formed of the amount of labor involved
in the reporting and printing of dally
verbatim reports of Congressional debates
and other proceedings. On June 5, 1900,
the first edition of the Record contained
128 pages, and a second edition contained
64 additional pages, making a total of 192
pages of that edition.
How Verbatim Reports Are Made.
The verbatim reports of debates and
other proceedings in Congress are made by
five reporters in Â«n.ch house. Each report
er occupies about llfteon minutes in tak
ing stenographic notes of a debute or
other proceedings, then retires from the
hall to a room Â»ear by, where he trans
lates his notes Into a phonograph, and
from the phonograph they are transferred
by typewriting into copy, ready for the
reportorial reviser, and by him.transmit
ted by a bicycle-mounted messenger to
the Congressional Record division of the
Government Printing Office.
The printing of documents and blanks
for Congress and the executive depart
ments has passed through several stages
of . evolution, keeping: pace with the
growth of tho population of the country
and the progress of mechanical invention.
During the sessions of the first Congress
the document printing and all other print
ing for the body was done 1 under the
authority^ of the Secretary of the Senate
and the Clerk of the House of Represen
tatives, who made yearly contracts there
for. The estimate for this work. during
the first session of the first Congress was.
for the Senate, $2300, and covered the cost
of stationery ns well as printing, book
binding and other contingent or incidental
expenses. The estimate for the same
class of expenses of the house was $3657.
When the seat of Government was re
moved -to Philadelphia the printing â¢ for
Congress was awarded by the Clerk of
the House of Representatives and the
Secretary of the Senate. The work was
executed- by the- proprietors of newspa
per oftlces. .When the capital was estab
lished in Washington types, presses, paper,
printers and even fuel had to be obtained
from other localities. Transportation fa
cilities were scarce and poor. Printing
supplies were poor." The plan recommend
ed and adopted provided that the Secre
tary of -.the Senate and the Clerk of the
House of Representatives, within' thirty
days after the close of Â« each session of
Congress, should advertise for fuel,, sta
tionery; and printing for the next Con
gress. ; '
â¢â¢ ' President Jefferson's Messages.
President Jefferson, Instead of personal
ly addressing the two houses of Congress,
as George Washington "and John 'Adams
had 'done, : i sent , his "annual- message., in
writing Awith accompanying: documents.
When printed these communications made
X.â THE LARGEST PBINTING OFFICE IN THE WORLD.
a small Quarto volume of only about 100
pages. In the House of Representatives
there was considerable discussion over
the question whether there should be 150
or '500 copies of this volume printed for
the use of Congress. A resolution In favor
of the larger number finally prevailed,
and the cost of printing and binding was
$520 75. . â¢ " .
The secretary of the Senate and the
clerk of the House of Representatives
continued to award I the contracts for
printing for Congress under the system of
competitive bids until 1819. The work was
done by | different master printers in
Washington. vOne of them testified before
a Congressional committee that the entire
force employed at any time by these mas
ter printers did not exceed thirty to
thirty-flve and: another testified that the
price paid to journeyman printers in 1S19
during the session of Congress was HO a
week and $9 a week during the reces3.
Troubles Over Public Printing 1 .
In 1819 the manner in which the public
printing had been executed by the several
master printers was such that a joint
committee of Congress was appointed to
devise some plan tor doing the work in a
more satisfactory manner. The committee
considered the establishment of a national
printing office, with bindery and station
ery divisions attached, and were convinced
that this plan would be practicable, but
they deemed it not advisable to submit a
proposition on which there would prob
ably be a considerable diversity of opin
ion.
The committee submitted an alternative
recommendation for a tariff of prices for
all kinds of Government printing, and for
the choice by each house of Congress of a
printer to execute its own work during the
succeeding Congressional term. This rec
ommendation â¢ was adopted by Congress
and the Congressional printers thus se
lected employed master. printers to exe
cute the work. With some modifications
this system was continued until the pres-
? n * Government Printing Office was es
tablished. In 1840 the Committee on Print
ng of the House of Representatives, as
the result of an Investigation on the sub
ject, made a unanimous report . in favor
of a public printing office, under proper
regulations, believing that "an immense
saving to the public treasury and the
abatement of an extensive political evil
would be the result.".
The Government Printing Office.
The cost of skilled labor has greatly in
creased since the establishment of the
Government printing: office in lS61i For
several years previously the wages of
compositors. and pressmen were fixed by
the printers' union at $14 a week In Feb
ruary, 1863, they were raised to $16 a week;
ieci e TÂ« er> 1863> to $1& a week:. in June,
1864, to $21 a week: in November, 1864, to
$24 a week. The last named rate is the
one now received in the Government print
ing office by nearly all classes of skilled
workmen.
On Â¥ a J 31 - 1S6 Â°- a 3olnt resolution was
Passed by Congress authorizing the es
tablishment of a Government printing of
fice and the appointment by the Presi
dent Of a superintendent of printing. John
D. Defrees of Indiana was appointed by
President Lincoln the first incumbent of
that office, and held K until August, 1S66,
when he was removed by President John
son. Cornelius Wendell succeeded Mr. De
frees by appointment by President John
son,-but was legislated out by the aboli
tion of the office. The title of "Congres
sional Printer" was substituted for that
of "Superintendent of Printing," and Mr.
Defrees was restored .o his old position
by vote of the Senate. In April, 1869, A.
M. Clapp of New York was elected by
the Senate to succeed Mr. Defrees as Con
gressional Printer, and held the office un
til July, 1876, when an act of Congress
was passed creating the office of Public
Printer, to be filled by appointment by
the President and confirmation by the
Senate. Mr. Clapp succeeded to that of
fice and administered its duties until June,
1877, when Mr. Defrees was appointed to
that position by President Hayes. Sterl
ing P. Rounds of Illinois was appointed
by President Arthur in April, 1882; Thomas
E. Benedict by President Cleveland in Sep
tember, 1S86. and in May, 1834; Frank W.
Palmer by President Harrison in May,
18S9, and by President McKinley in April,
1897.
For the uses of a Government printing
office the building erected by Cornelius
Wendell on the corner of H and North
Capitol streets was purchased by the Gov
ernment at a cost of $146,545.- This price
included materials, fixtures and machin
ery. - â¢
Publicity for Government Affairs.
I have been asked to explain precisely
what relation the Government Printing
Office plant sustains to the Federar Gov
ernment. The answer to this request
may be practically found in the brief
historical sketch of the plant already
given. From 1789 until 1861 nearly every
possible phase of the contract system for
obtaining necessary printing ! for Con
gress and the several executive depart
ments had been tried, every experiment
had proved unsatisfactory and had beer*
abandoned. Invitations to master print
ers, whether of newspaper, book or job
plants, for competitive bids led almost in
evitably to lower rates for doing the worK
than contractors could afford, and in
ferior workmanship or appeals to Con
gress for supplementary payments to
cover the losses were tne usual alterna
tives. The worst results -of the system
were the delays in the execution of the
work. No bond could furnish full in
demnity for such delays. Allusion to
these delays has been already made In
this article. No individual or corporate
contractor could afford to establish j.
plant on a scale large enough to do the
printing for the Government and take the
chances of losing the work at the expir
ation of his contract.
The establishment of the Government
Printing Office in 1S61 was an experiment.
At first the work was confined to the
printing of official blanKS and document*.
but this was deemed so satisfactory, bofa
as to cost and promptness of execution,
i that, the official- publication of debate."
and j other proceedings in Congress was
, authorized to be done at the Government
, Printing Office, and for a period of near
i ly three decades this record of Congres
Â¦ sional proceedings has been executed
r with such accuraoy and promptness as to
i elicit universal commendation.
Under no Government in tho world are
i official documents circulated among the
â¢ people on a scale so liberal as In the
i United States.

land the old Puritan element is giving way rapidly
before a new population. -It is a case of conquest by
immigration, and one cf the most interesting features
of it is that the prolific immigrants are composed
very largely of French" Canadians. So that we have
the queer probability before us of a capture of New
England by the descendants of the people whom the
New Englanders helped to conquer and annex to the
British empire.
After all it is example that counts. Professor Her
ron has pointed a way to others that he seems not to
have followed himself. The other has simply taken
to the path himself in which he would have others
walk, and his example has been worth more than all
the professor's exhortations.
There is in California a venerable preacher who in
his early days of struggle and privation helped his
wife by doing the washing and ironing, scrubbing.
sweeping and other household drudgery. He did not
make florid talks about applied Christianity, but pro
ceeded to apply it in his daily life and within his own
door, helping and blessing those nearest to him. No
rich woman endowed him, nor took him to Europe.
He was hot known to the great world outside the
parishes he served in bis itinerant career, but he has
everywhere left an example of gentleness and service
that has probably formed more lives' to goodness of
purpose than were influenced by the endowed clerical
professor.
It is also said that his affections were transferred to
the daughter of his patroness. Those who remember
his addresses delivered in this State will recall the aus
terity of his judgment against those who sought a soft
life and refused to harden it by bearing the burdens
of others. It was to be expected that he would apply
his principles at home and instead of deserting his
family would have been found doing housework,
washing windows and cooking, to help his wife and
keep the pot boiling.
All the world is interested in a better life and never
neglects or coldly rejects counsel leading thereto.
But not all the world will ever be unmindful of the
personality of the counselor. For this reason it is un
fortunate for Professor Herron's brand of applied
Christianity that he seems to have failed to apply it in
his personal conduct and within his own household.
It is reported that he made the, tour of Europe with
his wealthy patroness and her daughter, and his wife
asked for a divorce on the ground of desertion and
non-support. In her petition she alleged that she and
their four children were practically left , to shift for
themselves, while the professor took in Europe, with
expenses paid.
For some reason his connection with the Congre
gational College at Grinnell was terminated, and he
enlarged his field of effort by appearing as a lecturer,
inculcating everywhere a severe morality and teaching
a quality of Christian duty which was supposed to
imply the appearance of millennial conditions when
ever accepted and made the rule of life.
He made a great stir in the country and was in the
habit of 'roasting the other clergy in a way that de
tracted from their peace of mind. He strove to make
them appear as false lights, blind guides and hypo
crites, like the Scribes and Pharisees. .
Those who teach and those who accept entire the
four gospels have taken in a spiritual sense, or as alle
gorical, much that Professor He-ron held to be literal
and made the foundation of his cult. -
IT has rarely proved possible to separate a doctrine
from the personality of its teacher. If he fail to
make what he teaches his own rule in daily life
his teaching is looked upon with suspicion and his
doctrine is discredited. Some years ago a rich woman
endowed sumptuously the chair of applied Christian
ity in Iowa College, at Grinnell, and Rev. Mr. Her
ron, a Congregational minister, was appointed pro
fessor of that science. We believe that his appoint
ment was a "condition of the endowment. Professor
Herron called himself a Christian socialist, and held
that pure Christianity is socialism of an advanced
type. We are not aware that his views were in exact
harmony with what is generally understood to be the
platform of the socialist organization.- They were

Disaster at a Curve on a Colorado
Railroad Results in Serious
(Â¦,V; I Damage.
FLORENCE* Colo., April 19.â A serious
head-on collision occurred on the Florence
and Cripple Creek road to-day near Rus
sell, seven miles north of this city. Six
persons were injured. They are:
Hugh Conway, Canyon City, fireman on
passenger train, left foot crushed: James
Maclaren, engineer on passenger, severely
cut about head, neck and shoulders; Engi
neer Mason, cut about face; John Brown,
conductor on passenger, back badly
wrenched; F. W. Perry, .Denver, chest
crushed; Charles T. Sprague, newspaper
man from Atlanta, Ga., nose broken and
cut about head.
The accident occurred on a sharp curve.
A light engine was coming from Cripple
Creek and was trying to make the siding
at Oro. Junta. The passenger train was
running at a speed of about ten miles
an hour. Both engines were demolished.
The responsibility for the collision has not
yet been fixed.
Railroad magnates, having arrived at
the conclusion - that it takes three times
as many cars to move a given quantity
of freight as it did in former times, have
turned the problem of correction over to
Midgley. Should his experiments prove
satisfactory the bureau will be made per
manent. Detention of cars at freight ter
minals is the greatest evil Midgley will
attempt to correct. It is said that chiefly
from this, cause the car- famine of the
last year resulted. , â
Railway officials declare that the aver
age daily | service of a freight car has
fallen to below twenty-flve miles tier day,
where formerly the average was ninety
five miles. The new bureau is to be in
the nature of a car tracing organization
which will see to it that a car, having
arrived at a terminal station, is quickly
unloaded 'and returned by the shortest
route to the road to which it belongs.
fro.ads of the United States are expected
to Interest themselves, is an experiment
which will soon be tried at the instance
of financial powers who have recently en
gineered gigantic changes in the railway
systems of the 'country. J. W. Midgley,
formerly chairman of the "Western Freight
Association, will have charge of the bu
reau, with headquarters at Kansas City.'

SAIC JOSE, April 13.â The number of
poets throughout the county of Santa
Clara brought to light by the desire of
the Rose Carnival committee for an ode
to do honor to President McKinley upon
his visit to this city on May 13 is surpris
ing. There has been no public request for
such a poem and no idea of a contest for
poetical supremacy, but it has become
pent rally understood that the souvenir
v-hioh will be presented to Mr. and Mrs.
McKinley will contain a few rhythmical
lines commemorative cf the occasion.
Xow each mail is bringing to the com
mittee a supply of McKinley poetry, from
the four-line blank verse iambic penta
meter to the column and a half of dog
gerel to the air "Marching Through Geor
gia." Some is good, some bad and some
indifferent; all is laudatory pt the Presi
dent. The verses for the souvenir have
h(-en ordered and written and the com
mittee is debating how to dispose of this
surplus. Â»

Y far the largest attendance of 1
the week visited the industrial
and allied arts exhibition at Me-
chanics Pavilion yesterday after
noon and evening. A most inter
esting programme was rendered and the
Jewish Orphan Asylum band played selec
tions throughout the afternoon. Mrs.
Austin Sperry's "Illustrations of Old-Time
Industry" were enthusiastically received.
Pianoforte selections by pupils Of Pro
fessor Robert Tolme also elicited hearty
applause. A duo, "Phaeton," by Misses
Nellie Davenport and Elsa von Mander
scheid was very artistically rendered.
Other features of the afternoon musical
programme wsre selections from Mosz
kowskl and Chopin by Miss Davenport
and Miss Mandc-rscheid respectively.
In the evening Miss Cecilia Zinnen sang
the aria from Gounod's "Faust," accom
panied by Mr. Fred Maurer. She was fol
lowed by Miss Henriette Grothwell in the
"Sapphic Ode" to her own accompani
ment. Mr. and Mrs. Cadenaso gave a se
lected duet and were the recipients of
most cordial applause.
The exhibition will close to-night and
the California Club is to be congratu
lated upon its complete success. Every
element of encouragement for the annual
exhibitions has marked the course of this

of the club. The exhibition has fully sub
served the purposes of its creation. All

During the past winter the retail price
of ccal was so high that the Government
was appealed to for a reduction of the
duties on foreign coal, but this was not
granted. However, says Consul Bruner,
should the domestic supply be further
curtailed and prices advanced by reason
of another strike, it is not improbable
that, upon the renewal' of demands, the
Government will take measures to facili
tate the importation ot coal by a reduc
tion of duties and railway freight rates.
There is a likelihood, too, that other
trades will join thq strike, says Consul
Bruner, for iron workers, furnace men
and machinists realize that the scarcity
cf fuel caused by a strike of .the miners
would also throw them out of employ
ment. The silk and velvet ribbon weavers
are discussing the propriety of striking
at the same time.
WASHINGTON, AprlllD.â A strike by
the coal miners of France, planned to be
general and to include all the miners in
the country, is scheduled to take place
about the end of the coming June unless
terms are agreed upon before the date.
Thi3 latter eventuality is not expected, ac
cording to United States Consul Bruner
at St. Etienne in a report to the State
Department.

WASHINGTON, April 19.â Henry White,
secretary of the United States .Embassy
at London, was introduced to the Presi
dent to-day before the Cabinet meeting
by Secretary Hay. White Is here on his
annual visit to this country and will re
turn to England next month. He has
taken a great interest in the case of Mrs.
Maybrick. ,' ''
\ "The worst thing that could happen for
Mrs Maybrick," said he, "is for some one
to resume the agitation of her case in this
country. Her eventual freedom has been
delayed by the agitation over her. The
revival of the talk has led to abusive let
ters being sent to the English authorities
by people in this country. Even Queen
Victoria was the recipient of several let
ters from enthusiasts in Mrs. Maybrick's
cause. I have been working on the case
ever since Mrs. Maybrick was sent to
prison and at every opportunity to do
something for the unfortunate woman, I
have exerted myself with every Home
Secretary in the British Cabinet.
"I have no means of knowing what King
Edward will do, but I do not believe he
will interfere in the case The late Queen
made a strict rule to have nothing to do
with capital cases. Mrs. Maybrick is in
the Aylesbury prison and is kindly treat
ed. I hear indirectly froin her twice a
week. Her health is not seriously affected,
although she has not been in the -best
of health. She is fairly cheerful and has
a good prison record."

A man's success during the day in his

largely on his breakfast. If he leaves the
breakfast table half satisfied or half hun-

organs are in a condition of disorder for
the whole day. A breakfast poorly begun
means that the work of the day drags and

"â¢Â« jÂ£3-HJ:JvHf * n my^rrV^ tC Ere d% <gflThis morning Assistant District Attor
ney Greany will make the closing argu
ment for the prosecution and after the
charge by Judge Dunne the case will be
given to the jury for decision.
Morning and afternoon sessions j of the
trial yesterday were taken up by argu
ments of counsel. In the morning District
Attorney Byington delivered the, opening
statement for the prosecution. He re
viewed the evidence and characterized the
killing of Trewhella as a "colS-blooded,
deliberate assassination." He claimed
that Glaze lay in wait in a dark room and
shot Trewhella, who was unarmed, emp
tying his revolver, even after a fatal
wound had been inflicted. The District
Attorney dwelt upon the fact that three
bullets were fired into the back of Trew
hella, and said that the powder burns on
the body of the dead man proved conclu
sively that Glaze shot him' at close range
and not from a distance, as claimed.
"The evidence of O'Connor, the eye-wit
ness to the crime," said the District At
torney, "has been fully confirmed, both
by witnesses for the | prosecution and by
those of the defense. Glaze says that he
did noi know if he had wounded Trew
hella, yet he has said that when he. saw
his partner lying on the ground, he did
not stop to see if he could render assist
ance. Is this consistent with a plea of self
defense?"
The District Attorney reviewed the evi
dence of the men who claimed that they
had heard threats made by Trewhella
against Glaze and pronounced the testi
mony false. He dwelt strongly on the
purchase of cartridges by thffe accused a
short time before he shot Trewhella, and
on the trouble of the night before the kill
ing, in which Mrs. Glaze tpok part.
Peixotto Speaks for Hours.
. Attorney Pelxotto made the opening ad
dress for the defense and occupied three
hours in his speech. He reviewed the evi
dence of the case and claimed that the
character of Glaze had never been im
pugned, though the defense had opened
the door for such a step. Peixotto argued
that Trewhella had frequently threatened
Glaze, but that Glaze had always acted
the role of peacemaker and avoided
trouble. . ' , Â¦
When Peixotto started to argue points
of law with the jury, the prosecution ob
jected and Judge Dunne insisted that the
attorney confine his speech to facts and
evidence. When Peixotto ignored the in
struction, the Judge reminded him of his
neglect and a warning of a fine for con
tempt of court guided Peixotto on the
right track.v -
The attorney for the defense claimed
that the purchase of cartridges by Glaze
was a natural act for a man who always
carried a revolver. ! He insisted that when
Glaze shot Trewhella he did so honestly,
lieving that his life was In danger, and
that ! O'Connor had lied when he claimed
that Glaze had asked him to : say that
Trewhella had shot himself.
Foote Ridicules the Evidence.
Attorney Foote closed for the defense
and did not make a long speech. He ridi
culed thevevidence of the prosecution, es
pecially that of the bellboy, O'Connor.
Foote claimed that the police and the
lawyers for Trewhella had hounded Glaze,
and that the prosecution was unfair and
biased. The attorney argued that Glaze
had simply defended himself when he
thought and believed his life was In peril,
and that his prosecution was chiefly actu
ated by revenee on the part of the rela
tives of Trewhella.

Dooling of San Benlto County and Supe

will be resumed this morning at 10 o'clock.

The Thomas Got Dispatch.
One of the smartest pieces of work ever
done on the water front was performed
by the army transport officials in getting
the Thomas ready for sea. At first it was
intended to send the big transport away
on May 1, but orders were issued to get
her ready to sail to-morrow, and the work
had to be done. On Monday the vessel
was; brought alongside the transport
v. harf late in the afternoon. Tuesday
morning gangs of men were at work and
the ship was cleaned and painted from
stem to stern. The machinery was over
hauled. 2400 tons of coal taken aboard so
?s to enable the transport to go direct to
Manila without a stop, stores for the
round trip were put aboard and 4000 tons
of freight stowed away in the holds. Last
night the Thomas was rea^y for sea and
will sail at noon to-day with 300 recruits
and 150 marines for the Philippines. Cap
tain Batchelder. assistant depot quarter

perintendent, are justly proud of the
sir.art piece of work.

last year and the chances are they will
be the first to arrive this year. Both ves
sels were built for bucking the Ice and
Captains Mason and Ellis know the Arctic

The Jeanie and Thrasher will therefore
go throug-h openings in the ice and make
headway Â¦when other steamships are tied
up awaiting a chance to get through.

O'HARE IS SAFE,
SAYS JACQUES
Charge of Abduction
Strenuously Denied
in Court.
Aged Capitalist Alleged to Be
in Minneapolis With
The case at Thomas Jacques of S28 Lom
bard street and his wife, . Caroline E.
Jacques, charged with* the abduction of
Joseph O'Hare, was called in Judge Ca
baniss* court yesterday morning'. As ar
ranged the previous night Jacques was
arrested at 7 o'clock yesterday morning
at his residence, and his wife at the St
Nicholas Hotel. The defendants were rep
resented by Greorge A.' Knight and the
complaining witness, Mrs. Margaret Gow
dey, of Brooklyn.' N. - Y.. niece of the old
man alleged to have been abducted, has
as her attorney "W. M. Cannon, but he
telephoned that he was unable to be pres
ent in court and was .willing to agree to a
continuance. â¢
After the defendants had been Instruct
ed as to their rights. Knight said:
"As I understand the facts of the case,
Mr. O'Hare is an old ffentleman who was
living with Mr. Jacques and his family
lor a number of years. In fact their ac
quaintanceship dates back thirty-five or
forty-five years. There are two sisters In
volved in this particular proceeding, one
â¢who- has sworn to the complaint -and the
ether, who Is in Minneapolis, now has
the custody of her uncle. Mr. O'Hare left
here some time ago and on the 18th of this
month Mrs. Jacques received a telegram
that Mr. O'Hare arrived In Minneapolis
well and happy. Bhe came out here unbe
known to the one who makes the com
plaint here and took her uncle away.
Jacques and his wife have been here all
the time and the old man is not here.
Those people have not been out of the
State and in no way, shape or form have
they kidnaped, arrested, abducted, stolen
or taken away the c-ld man. What I want
your Honor to do at this time is to fix a
nominal bail for the defendants to appear
hers at any time you may see fit for the
purpose of going Into the case."
Assistant District Attorney Henley
asked how long the defendants had lived
here and Knight replied, "Since 1856.
"Technically," said the Judge, "this
charge might bo made out even if In fact
the defendants never moved so far as one
Inch from this city with the old man,
Joseph O'Hare. The taking of a person
into custody, so to speak, with Intent to
<io something else, that is, to spirit that
person awayâ that would constitute the
offense. Mr. Knight, I ask you if you feel
absolutely sure and give me your personal
assurance that when these parties are
again needed in this case they will be
here."
Knlgrht replied that he would willingly
give his personal assurance they would
be there and added that Mr. Jacques had
livpd here for forty-five years.
The Judge then fixed the bail of each
defendant at $200 cash, and it was prompt
ly forthcoming:. A youth named Adolph
was in court with the defendants and
made himself so obnoxious that the bailiff
had to call him to order. The case was
continued till Tuesday.
The guardianship proceedings in Judge
Coffey's court were yesterday continued
till April 24, as Knight explained to the
Judge that the respondents were in the
custody of the police.

these cases has been the direct cause of
the health-revival 'that is now arousing
such tremendous enthusiasm!
That Santiago seconds Havana's in-
dorsement of Paine's celery compound
is shown by the following letter from
Belen Guerra:
Santiago, Cuba, Jan., igoi.
Wells, Richardson Co.:
Dear Sirs â I have had the gout in my
fingers and hands. My limbs were be-
numbed and I could hardly stand. I
went to several physicians. A druggist
advised me to use Paine's celery com-
pound. I began at once to pret better,
and to-day I am perfectly well. Nat-
urally I have great faith in Paine's cel-
ery compound. Very tsuly yours,
MRS. BELEN GUERRA.
Everyone in this springtime needs to*
purify the blood and regulate the nerve3.
Carry home to-day^â not by and by â a
bottle of Paine's celery compound. Cure
nervousness, neuralgia and rheumatism
this spring. You can now put your
health on a sound basis by means of
Paine's celery compound.
Such evidences of an unhealthy condi-
tion as those constant headaches, melan-
choly, dyspepsia or constipation rapidly
disappear under the cleansing, regulat-
ing action of Paine's celery compound.
CUBAN TEACHERS' VISIT
STARTS HEALTH REVIVAL
Paine's Celery Compound Doing Won-
derful Work Among Sick,
The visit of hundreds of bright Cuban
teachers to the United States last sum-
mer has caused a tremendous health-
revival in Havana and Santiago.
The American idea, "A sound mind in
a sound body," is one of the first lessons
Cuba and Porto Rico are learning.
But they are learning fast.
Whatever distrust Cubans may have
of American politicians, they have con-
fidence in America's greatest remedy,
Paine's celery compound.
It has opened the eyes of the people
of Havana and Santiago to the possibili-
ties of good health in a way their crude
remedies had never let them imagine.
Paine's celery compound is doinp: a
tremendous missionary work this spring
among the sick, not only throughout
the United States, but wherever the
American influence is felt.
The best families in Santiago are
taking Paine's celery compound. The
common people are looking after their
health as never before.' American phy-
sicians in Havana are ordering the
great spring remedy. Its health-giving
effect on friends and relatives who
first tried Paine's celery compound in
the United States has encouraged thou-
sands of despondent, hopeless suffefer3
at home to use it. The result in all

DURING THE WEEK. â¢ . -
THE second evening of the fair, ex
hibition and ball given under the
auspices of the ladies of the Verein
Eintracht, now in progress at 237
Twelfth street, attracted a large
crowd last night. The entertainment will
continue to-night and Sunday afternoon

and red made merry without restraint un
til the small hours of the morning.
Many spirited voting competitions are
going on. The contest for a handsome
present, to be given to the "most beauti

extreme. Miss Florence Hays,- a buxom
belle, is in the lead with 144 votes to her
credit.

the prize which will be awarded the "most
popular lady."

IROQUOIS CLUB
TO CELEBRATE
Historical Party Event
to Be Fittingly-
Observed.
The State League of Iroquol3 Clubs has
decided to hold the annual conference of
this year at Benicia on May 19. The con
vention usually meets on "Washington's
birthday, but the meeting "was postponed
this year in order to celebrate the anni
versary of the first Democratic conven
tion held in California at Benicia on May
19. 1S51.
The old State House, the historic build
ing in which the Leeislature held its
first sessions when Benicia was the capi
tal of the State, will be the scene of the
anniversary exercises.
Some of those who- participated In the
memorable convention were John Bigler,
afterward elected Governor, David Brod
erick, who was killed by Terry. Barclay
Henley's father, ex-Senators Latham and
Gwin and ex-Governor Weller. Samuel A.
Merritt of Salt Lake Citv and J.^H. Mc-
Kune, two of the original delegates, will
be present. In commemoration of the im
portant event, members ot the party and
hospitable citizens of Beulcia are pre
paring a fitting celebration.
The orator of the day has not yet been
selected, but a. musical programme has
been arranged and the citizens of Benicia
have planned drives and other amuse
ments for the guests. On the following
day. May 20. the regular annual business
meeting will be held and on the reauesc
of the National Democratic Committee,
steps will be taken "to perfect a more
thorough organization of the Iroquois
clubs of the State. - . '
The local club met last nlfrht and dis
cussed plans for the celebration. About
4000 guests are expected to attend and con
vention and measures are being taken to
assure proper hotel and other accommo
dations. - â¢

The directors of the Ohio Society met at
the Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon for
the purpose of considering plans for the
reception to be 'accorded Governor Nash
on his arrival in this city. The question
of arrangements for welcoming the Gov
ernor is one of extreme delicacy on ac
count of his arriving only a day ahead of
President McKinley or possibly on the
fame day. Nothing can be allowed to de
tract from the society's homage to the
President, and on the other hand Gover
nor Nash must not be made to feel that
he is only a secondary attraction.
The only time that the Ohioans as a
body will entertain the President is at the
banquet, which will be held from 6 o'clock
till midnight on the evening of May 16. It
is felt by some of the directors of the so
ciety, therefore, that Governor Nash
should receive the attention of the society
at all other times.
A street parade in honor of the Governor
Is one of the features that is inviting con
siderable debate. President Gleaves of
the Ohio Society states that there are
from thirty to forty thousand Ohloans in
California and undoubtedly a sufficient
number for a successful reception of this
kind will be present. The plan of calling
out available military forces for the pa
rade was also under discussion, but there
is some doubt as to whether the authori
ties would consent to their appearing on
both o<~rapions. Governor Nash and his
staff will remain in the city for a period
of ten days so far as can be determined
at present, and a programme will be ar
ranged which will give him ample oppor
tunity to see everything of especial inter
est during that time.
The Governor will be accompanied by
200 members of the Columbus Board of
Tradf in addition to his staff and the Ohio
(.'ongreEFmen. It was finally decided to
defer the settlement of the questions in
volved ijll to-morrow, when committees
â¢will report on the result of plans and in
vestigations into what may be done in the
way cf arranging a parade.
A special vessel has been chartered from
â¢which to view the launching of the battle
ship Ohio, and it will carry 3200 represen
tatives of the Ohio societies of California.
Funds are coming in to the satisfaction of
the finance committee and the other com
mittees report excellent progress.

TO PASS THE CROWD.
How Healthy.
It probably comes to every thoughtful
person at times that there are plenty of
common, mediocre people, and that if
one determines to, he or she can press to
the front, pass the crowd, and win posi-
tion, fame and gold. It Is largely a matter
of determination and health. Many a de-
termined character with brilliant possibil-
ities is held back by 111 health. Some find
that bright, keen thoughts refuse to come
to their brains and wonder why.
The kind of brain work that makes
successful Merchants, Lawyers, Doctors,
Authors, etc. etc., makes heavy draughts
on the filling of the minute nerve cells of
the body, said filling being composed of
a greyish sort of material which must be
replaced day by day, or the brain and
other parts of the body will not act prop-
erly.
Coffee is a hidden but powerful enemy
to one's progress in life. Its subtle, nar-
otic poison â¢weakens heart. Interferes
with digestion and has a definite and de-
structive effect on the nervous system.
People who are content to load them-
selves â¢with impediments to progress, who
refuse to supply body with food and
drink of the kind needed to make up for
the daily disintegration of the nerves and
tissue must Eland aside In the race for
pre-eminence.
The ones who are properly fed will
surely win the laurels.
Postum Food Coffee furnishes the glu-
ten and phosphates of grain needed by
Nature to nourish brain and nerves with
food. It does hot narcotize and tear
down. It Is frequently misjudged on
first trial, because of Improper prepara-
tion, but it will be found to be a most de-
licious beverage, If, after boiling com-
mences, it be allowed to continue boiling-
for 15 minutes. This is necessary to ex-
tract the food value and flavor. -J." -.' *â¢ .

afflicted with sickness brought on r^^^^^^P Â©Â«f" Hii
A young lady from Denver, Colo., recently wrote a letter I
to Mrs. Pinkham, which aptly pictures the condition of a I
frr&xt Tin any young women. She says * I
"This is the first opportunity I have found to 'write and thank you for I
the good your Vegetable Compound has done me. I feel better than I have I
for years. It seems a ' seven days' wonder ' to my friends. Where I used to
be pitied, everything is the opposite now, and there is not a day bat what
some one wants to know what I have done to make myself look so welL
"Before taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound I had con-
stant headaches, was constipated, bloated, eyes weak and watery, bearing-
do wn pains, pains in the small of my back and right side ; took cold very
easily, which always caused intense pain in the ovaries, and I did not want
to go anywhere or see any one. I was called cross, but I could not help it,
feeling as. I did. I could not .lift anything or do any hard work 'without
suffering for days afterwards. Menstruation lasted for eight or ten days,
the first three or four days being almost constant pain day and night."
What a picture this is, and how unnecessary! Read the
letters which follow and see how easy it is to overcome
woman's suffering when you go the right way about it.
Nothing in this wide world has relieved so much female
suffering as has Liydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound; no ( medicine can produce such positive proof of
cures and good results ; therefore, no other medicine can be
' "just as good." Women should insist upon getting the med-
icine which has the best record, and which, they and every
druggist in the land know, has no equal.
Miss Thompson's Pains are Cured.
, "Dear JIes. Pdtkham:â I want%to tell you what Lydia E. Pink-
liam's Vegetable Compound has done for me. For several years I had
suffered with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, palpitation of
the heart, headache, pains in nearly all parts of the Tbody. My physician
said it was only indigestion, but his medicine did not help me any. I began
the use of -your Vegetable Compound. I have taken four bottles and now
those troubles are cured. I cannot praise it enough."â Miss Belle S.
Teosipson, Box 14, Acushnet, Mass.
Just why Miss Thompson's physician diagnosed her
trouble as indigestion it is hard to understand. This mistake,
however, is frequently made. If you have any doubt about
your case, write to Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass., for her
free advice. She will understand your symptoms' at once.
Miss Scholtes Tells of Suffering Overcome:
" Dear Mbs. Pujkham : â I to let you know that Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has cured me of painful menstruation from
which I suffered terribly. I really believe that I would be insane to-day if it
had not baen for your medicine. I cannot praise your Compound enough,
and feel that if all who suffer from female troubles would put themselves
under your care and follow your advice, they will find relief from their
sufferings."â Miss K. E. Scholtes, Mt. Oliver.-Pittsburg, Pa. o

CHICAGO, Â¦ April 19.â A rather brisk trade
was enjoyed by. the wheat market during the'
first hour, largely because the news was any
thing, but clearly Indicative one. way or the
other. "Argentine shipments, according to the
Board of Trade . cable, were . much less than
they were a year ago,' but Liverpool . Ignored
the figures and registered a decline. The
cables, with the assistance of excellent weather
and undimmed crop prospects, had - the best
of the argument at the start, May opening
%@%c to %@%c lower at 70%@70%c. A re
port that the English weakness was , due to
selling of wheat bought in anticipation, of the
imposition of an import tariff on breadstuff s
gave the Â» bulls some iiope and they succeeded
in working a rally to 70%@71c during the first
hour. During this perlucl there had been some
outside Interest in the market, .but It was
soon withdrawn and even the ' local trade be
came dull. Lacking support May gradually
worked back to 70%c. The corn strength caused
some covering and May reacted to 70%c and
closed soon after In a fairly steady condition,
Vtc under yesterday at 70%(g)70%c.
Corn displayed considerable firmness/ which
seemed to be based chiefly on the aggressive
attitude of the bull leader. Aside from his
support little corn was wanted. May closed
J ,ic higher at 44%@44Kc.
Oats were dull. May closed a shade down
at 25Vi@25%c.
Provisions were fairly active. The market
opened firm on light hog receipts and sym
pathy with higher prices at the stockyards.
Profit-takingr by shorts caused further gains.
July pork closed 30c higher, lard 5c up and
ribs B@7 J /4c improved. . <

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, April 19.â To-day's stock mar
ket was the most remarkable which has yet
beeii seen ilurin? the present speculative era.
Not enly In the aggregate sales, which reached
Â£.ir3,900 shares, but in thÂ« wide distribution
mid var'ety of the trading, the amount and
the lumber of the gains recorded, the record
l>riets touched, < be ' v.-ideness of the general
outside inteiest manifested in the market and
licm almost any point of view, the market
was entirely without precedent in the history
of Wall street. The feverish tone which has
l*en a feature of the market on some of the
lieuvy speculative cays of late and which was
due to a state of nervous apprehension on the
1-art of th* speculators for the rise, seemed
to be entirely lacking in to-day's market.
There was a steady and persistent uplift of
prices, which was as irresistible as hydraulic
ITussuro. The occasional profit-taking, which
was largely h.v room traders, was licked up
wiih hardly more than a momentary Influence
on prices. Even the selling to take profits in
the last bour, which was naturally very large
after bo considerable a show of profits on the
<iay's movement, stopped at about a point,
even in the most active and buoyant of the
stocks, and the market surged upward again
at the last, closing in a buoyant and spectacu
lar outburst such as was perhaps never seen
Vefcre.
In the last five minutes of the trading the
tai>e recorded such transactions as 6000 shares
of Pennsylvania at 160. while in Union Pa
cific there was a string of transactions of D0O0
Fharet at 99%, 6000 shares at 100; 3000 shares at
SÂ»!s; 6000 at 100, and a final block of 10,000
shares at 100 at the tcp price for the day and
in the history of the stock. These transactions
were exceptional, blocks of from 1000 to 5000
tJhai-cs of many of the active stocks changed
hands all day. Only tome factor of universal
application could at all account for such gen
eral strength. There was a marked relaxation
in the money market and the prospect of a
very strong: bank statement to-morrow. Of Â¦
courte this factor has only a remote bearing
on the value of properties whose shares were
in such easer demand to-day, but it furnishes
the cinews of war upon which the speculators
are dependent for carrying on their campaign.
It has- been shown a number of times recently
that the cutting off of these Binews is the
only thins Â¦ which will serve to : repress the
inoculative ardor v.-hich seems to have thor
oughly i*rcneated the spirit of the American
people. With the replenishment of available
resources to-day, the speculation was revived
in an unbridled manner. There were few spe
cinc influences to be detected in the trading.
The completion cf the Burlington 'deal of
coun-e had a notable influence on sentiment,
although Burlington. Great Northern and
Northern Pacific held a comparatively Incon
spicuous place in the trading. But the air
we* thick with rumors of measures to be
taken by rival railroad systems to offset the
Bur'.ington deal. The movement in Union
Pacific and In the Atehisons was distinctly
traceable' to this Influence, aided by. Fupple
mentary rumors cf coming dividend increases.
The Hiitish export duty on coal was a factor
I* the buoyant uplift of the seaboard bitu
minous coal carriers, as it aroused hopes of a
large growth in our export trade in coal. The
eo-ca!!ed junior Vanderbilts evidently moved
in sympathy on the supjx)sHion of closer com
bination and additional financial security with
the parent New York Central system. The ex
press stocks moved upward in company on the
belief that closer association was in view as
the result of yesterday's election as directors
of the United States Express of officials of
the other companies. Belief In a merger of
Southwestern railroads was a potent factor in
that section of the market. The buoyancy of
Amalgamated Copper was . accounted for by
rumors of further absorptions by that com
pany. Hope of dividend increases was a wide
reaching factcr. The smelting stocks were
etrong on this expectation. In a large number
of stocks there was not even an attempt to
assign a motive for the large buying, which
was palpably based on the all-embracing ex
pectation that the price of the stock would go
up because others had done so. A very sharp
contrast to the general movement of the mar
ket was the heaviness of the United- States
Eteol stocks, the preferred falling at one time
rearly a point below last night. Â¦ This was
partly accounted for by the circulation by the
bears of a rumor that J. P. Morgan was suf
feriiC from heart trouble, but the stocks did
not recover with the authoritative statement
that Mr. Morgan was In good health. This!
rumor helped to account also for the midday
dip in the market, which was effectually over
come. The strength of the market was so gen
era! that it Is only worth while to specify a
few of the more Important net gains. Â¦ Thes.
were: St. Paul, 6%; Baltimore and Ohio, 5%:
Union TadSc, 4; Amalgamated Copper, 4%:

NEW TORK. April IS.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The,' budget has been well received by the pub
lic generally. The coal Interests . are furious
and the sugar people i are somewhat sore and
indignant, but the markets, were unconcerned
and the public does not seem to care much.
Indirect taxation did not affect the stock trad-
Ing except In consols, which dipped . to 94% In
anticipation of the new loan, but they quickly ,
rallied to. S5 on heavy bidding . by big houses
for the new Issues, , running it. up to "* prem
ium ; this although the only conjecture â heard
is that the r#"i--e of the. issue; will, be, 94%.
Business on the Stock Exchange was, generally
speaking, on a moderate scale. The American
department was the feature of the day â¢ and
an astonishing feature it was. The dealings
were on the largest scale that we have had
here for a long time. There was furious bid
ding from start to finish, with prices rising
steadily, except where they went up by leaps.
It may be described as the first day of - the
London boom in American stocks. The public
here seem suddenly to have got tired of sitting
on the fence and they have Jumped down and
gone in at last.' The special . favorites .. were
Union Pacific. Chicago, . Milwaukee and St.
Paul, the Atchison issues (on the hope of a 4
per cent dividend- on the common) , and .Mis
souri . and Kansas Pacifies ' (on the reports of
the . Gould deal . in the Southwestern ' railways).
But the purchases were wild and Indiscriminate
throughout the session and e\-erytblng dealt In
here was taken. "^CSISSS&fcX&S&SSBf

While there is /.reason to anticipate a large

"During the week there have been three ar
rivals of coal from British Columbia, 8800 tons;
three Â¦ from Washington, 8333 tons; three from
Oregon, 1270 tons; one from Australia, 1426
tons; total, 19,834 tons. The arrivals continue
light, still there is ample in stock to- meet all
Immediate calls. Business generally 13 fair,
principally for steam-grades, for. which there
is active demand. ' In my circular of February
23d ult., I referred to the probability of an
export tax on coal by the British Government;
this has been realized to-day, as cables ars
here stating that an export duty of one shilling
per ton has been Imposed. This will materially
affect California shipments, . as 24 cents per
ton added to . the present asking prices for
coal will put a quietus on exports here. Swan
sea Is about the only port . at present from
which we derive any Â¦ British . coals, and we
will doubtless still receive an occasional ship
ment from there. Every change lately gives
the Northern collieries a stronger hold on this
market, - except fuel oil, which has come to
stay, and is drilling new recruits into its ser
vice dally. This will eventually make the price
schedule for coal, - and - the - year - 1902 will cause
a- revised . price .list, where values .will be
lower than those now ruling here. Oil values
are In -a very disturbed .condition, and the
producers . are the sufferers as usual; there is
needed a strong and capable man at the wheel
to direct and control." '

Brings Yellow Fever Into Port.
PARIS, April 19.â Great Interest was
taken here in the trial of Vera Gelo, the
Russian girl student, who was charged
with . trying to assassinate Professor
Kmile Deschanel, the aged Senator and
father of the President of the Chamber
of Deputies, on January 19, by firing a
revolver at him just as he" concluded a
lecture on French literature at the Col
lege of France. She was acquitted to
night. ;
The Interest In the case was heightened
by the fact that Zeliline, the Russian girl
friend of .Vera Gelo, who intervened be
tween latter and Professor Deschanel
at the time and received the bullet in her
chest, died in the hospital after lingering
some time in agony. Professor Deschanel
frequently visited the wounded girl i at

Mounce and Doxninick Hide in "The
County Fair" and Get Second
and Third.
It was "Jockeys' night" at the "County
Fair" last night. The California Theater
was crowded from pit to dome with a
large audience, composed mostly of men
who follow tho racing game. The or
chestra was crowded out of Us accus
tomed stand and sought refuge in the
wings.
Interest centered In tho famous horse
race of the play. Jockeys Mounce and
Domlnlck, dressed In the colors they have
time and again brought to the front at
Tanforan, participated, but, despite hard
riding, they had to submit gracefully to
second and third places. The lads were
greatly disappointed. They had 'made up
their minds to defeat Cold Molasses, the
animal that wins nightly, but an u.isym
pathelc scene shifter pulled the treadmill
on which the black horse was pounding.
Some of the jockeys' friends wanted the
horse disqualified and the scene shifter
fined for using a strong arm. but the
author of the play had decided differently.
Mounce rode Ginger and managed to come
under the imaginary wire in second place.
This fact gave the little Jockey some sat
isfaction.
Tommy Mead, the youth who rides for
Sam Hildreth, received an ovation after
singing "Always."
Among those present In the body of the
house were: President Thomas H. Will

THE rumors that have emanated
from Berkeley during the past
few days that Professor Joseph Le
Conte would be dropped from the
faculty ; of the State University
have caused intense Indignation among
the legion of friends of the aged and be
lcved instructor. , The story that the
Hoard of Regents would make a number
of changes and that Professor Lo Conte
und Professor Albin Putrkor were to be
deposed has absolutely no foundation.
The Board of Regents met yesterday
and passed the budget for the ensuing
year. Rumors were rife in the university
town during: the day that the regents ha-1
held a secret meeting- on Thursday and
had decided to depose Professor Le Conte
and Professor Putzker at the official
meeting of the board, but no such action
was taken.
Regent Arthur Rodgers was seen last
evening and he characterized the report
as a fabrication.
"It Is not worth the digrnityof a denial."
s=aid Mr. Rogers warmly, "and there is
not a word of truth In the statement.
The subject of the deposition of Professor
Le Conte has never been broached and
is not likely to be. I regret that any such
statement should be tnade. for It cannot
but hurt the feelings of the beloved pro
fessor."
No Truth in the Report.
Judge C. W. Slack, who is a recent of
i ne university, when asked about the ru
mors, said:
"There is not a word of truth in them.
It is false and it Is not necessary to sav
any more on the matter. Professor lÂ«e
Oonte is dearly beloved by all and why
these rumors are started I cannot unde-
btand. The regents have taken no step
to depope Professor Putrker."
Wheeler's Strong Denial.
Professor Le Oonte li:is been connected
with th<" siati- Vnlversity since its open
ing in ISO. and has held the chair in
KÂ©ology. botany and natural history for
that period. His fame as an educator is
world-wide and to munv thousands hn is
known a* "Joseph Le Come, the beloved "
Professor Puttkcr Is head of the depart
ment of German and entered the univer
sity in IS74 as instructor. It is evident
from a comparison of the university
r*>*ristÂ«- and th<Â» budget passed bv the
Board of Regent* yesterday, that 'there
will b* a new head to ih<Â» department of
German. In the register Professor Putx-
Uer Is mentioned as "professor of Ger
man language and literature." while in
the budget passed yesterday the profes
sor rank* as "professor of German litera
ture." The budget provides for a pro*
feesorshlp of "German lnnruaeo and liter
ature" at a salary of $3300. the space for
name of the holder of the post being va
cant. The vacant professorship also
comes under the head of "new positions."
OAKLAXD, April 19.â President Wheel

AUDITOR WELLS submitted to
the Board of Supervisors yester
day his estimate of the rate of
taxation necessary to meet the
current expenses of the various
departments of the municipal government
for the fiscal year, which he places at
$5,470,100 for all purposej. Based on an as
sessed valuation of $400,000,000 the Auditor
recommends the levying of a tax of $1
on every $100, of which .9231 will raise $-.
692,500, to be applied to expenditures and
.0769 will produce $307,500 fcr new Improve

pervisors Auditor Wells says:
Not only have I considered the wants of the
different departments, but I have taken into
consideration the public welfare, realizing that
public Improvements are imperative. I na\e
carefully made provision for permanent im
provements, viz.: the repairing and repaying
of streets the erection of municipal buildings
and the construction of sewers, etc.. all of
which you will note Is strictly within the ?1
I have also estimated that there will be a
cum of not less than $4S0.000 in the surplus
fund at the end of this fiscal year which_ I
consider revenue from other sources. Of this
amount I recommend the payment of the un
paid claims of salaries, work done and mate
rial furnished, during the forty-first, forty
second, forty-third and forty-fourth fiscal years
and the unpaid salaries of teachers, for the
fiftieth fiscal year, as per constitutional amend

In addition to the above, I desire to call
your attention to the fact that I have made
specific appropriations for salaries. mainte
nance and material for the different depart

Classification of the United States Gen
eral Appraisers to-day announced a de
cision In the Russian sugar case.
The board decided, by a majority vote,
that the American Government was justi
fied in assessing a countervailing duty on
Russian sugar, the precise amount being
determined according to the bounty de
clared to have been paid by the Russian
Government when the sugar was export
ed. The countervailing duty was levied
in connection with the circular issued by
Secretary Gage on February 11 last, This
circular was based on section 4 of tha
present tariff act, which, directs "that in,
addition to the regular duties countervail
ing duties shall be assessed upon goods
which receive bounties from foreign gov
ernments, the extra duty to be equal to
the bounty.

insists that there Is no political motive
underlying the question and that the re

however, by the press dispatches an

by the treasury officials that the Im

there was when the students tpok one of their
number who had ceased to be loyal and dipped
him in the deep, blue water. That act was
simply glorious!
Ralph T. Fisher, president of the As
sociated Students, was the first of the
speakers \to discuss for two minutes
"What Can Each of Us Do for the Uni
versity?" By being true to yourself, he
argued, you would be true to your col-
L.A. Wotnble, the football player, said:
We can do much here, little and big. The
man In the second eleven who gets nothing
but hard knocks and cheera and a two-and-a
half sweater at the end of the season Is the
man who sets an example -we should follow.
R. W. Tully said:
By realizing -what our university has done
for us we can best realize what we can do
for it. I will suggest a few things we can
do this summer vacation. When we get to our
homes we must show ourselves as true col
lege men and women. Each one should be
careful of what he says and to whom he says
it. Tell the farmer who cheerfully pays his
taxes not only of football victories, but of
what the agricultural department is doing,
what the chemistry and mining departments are
doing for us all. Teach the taxpayer that col
lege men are not snobs or caricatures of men
as pictured in the comic papers.
J. W. S. Butler spoke as follows:
The university has given us the beet It has.
We can stop petty class mix-ups and work to
gether as a unit, showing our loyalty in this
manner.
R. R. Service said:
We can each of us aid the university by
doing strongly, cleanly and well the things
that fall to our lot to do while we are at col
lege.
Yell Leader M. H. Schwartz said:
You should impress upon your fellow stu
dents to be gentlemen first and college en
thusiasts second. You ask me what is the
best thing I can do personally for the uni
versity; it is to get out, and I'm trying mighty
hard to do it.
Other speakers were C. S. Green, presi
dent of the Alumni Association: TV. B.
Greeley. F. M. Allen. Nathan Moran, H.
W. Furlong and J. M. Eshleman. -
EROYER'S POOLROOMS

Them Being State Senator John
. Hoey,' Arrested. .
The poolrooms conducted by A. B. Broy
er at 113 O'Parrell street were raided yes
terday afternoon about 1 o'clock by Cap
tain Wittman and posse. Policeman We
dekind, a new member of the force, was
instructed to try his hand at buying a
pool and he was to signal to the captain,
who stood on the opposite side of the

light, strolled leisurely to the door and
made the signal to the captain which had
been agreed upon.
Seventeen men were arrested, J. H.
Roche as the keeper, and sixteen visitors.
Among the latter was State Senator John
Hoey, who begged the captain not to send
him to the City Prison in the patrol wa
gon. His plea was unheeded. Two patrol
wagcna were in readiness and the seven
teen were bundled into them and driven
to the prison. Roche and Hoey were
promptly released on cash ball, the former
In JSO and the latter In $25. J. Kruse. a

425 Harrison street. Tickets, a board and
$84 85 were booked as evidence.

The stepping forward of the mast has
avoided the chief fault found with the
last challenger, the immense size of the
fore trianele. In this measurement the
new challenger comes out less than either
of the boats, her exact measurement be
ing seventy-one feet from mast to bow
sprit end. Generally the yacht Is fairly
lined and finely turned and looks quite fit
to sail for cup honors. - . -
These are the most striking character
istics. The under- water body is simply
an adaptation of the same idea to suit
the different conditions. The turn of the
bilge favors the Columbia rather than
Shamrock I and the fin is shorter and
shallower than that of the last challenger.
Over all the new boat is longer than
either the Challenger or Defender of
1899, being 133 feet. Her water line length
is right up to within a few inches of the
allowable limit of .ninety feet. In beam
she 'is practically the same as the last
cup racers, but her draught has been cut
down with a free hand and is something
less than nineteen feet. Her sail area is
more by 200 square feet than the Colum
bia's and close up to the amount of cloth
shown, in the first Shamrock. -
Fairly Lined; Finely Turned.
The bow/ instead of being flattened on
the side, is carried round in a perfect
spoon. The mast is stepped forward of
the usual place and the beam is car
ried well into the overhang. The free
board is cut down to about two-thirds of
that the Shamrock I showed above the
water.
The test tank experiments, of which so
much has been written, certainly gave
some very valuable results, but these re
sults tended mostly in the direction of
confirming the yacht designers on the
general line upon 'which they had been
progressing. The alterations suggested
by the towing . experiments were in shape
and not In type, and this has led even
some members of the crew w,ho saw the
yacht yesterday to commit themselves to
the opinion that there is nothing new in
the shape of the Shamrock II. This, how
ever, is barely half the truth, for although
the hull presents no abnormal character
istics it embodies a number of new feat
ures which have an important bearing on
the result of the coming race and on the
development of yacht designing.
Early in the work of designing the
Shamrock II Watson decided to risk noth
ing in the production of a freak boat, and
to the unskilled eye the Shamrock II looks
exactly like the latest of the big racing
cutters.. . . . 'Â¦ : .
Shamrock Is No Freak.
It is ascertained that the Shamrock I
has , been Improved to a greater extent
than Watson might have wished. So
much mystery has been made of the build-
Ing of the cup challenger that there is
an expectation of something phenomenal
and ' absolutely unique in the way of
yachting architecture to be disclosed when
she is knocked .away to-morrow. This
expectation Is doomed to disappointment.
The notable people who will attend the
launching ceremonies will arrive here to
morrow. Among these who are expected
to be present is Mr. Fife. Sir Thomas
Lipton hopes that tho yacht will sail for
the Solent Thursday.
"I can only tell you what John Hender
son, who .'built the Meteor, Thistle and
Valkyrie, remarked, to-day after close in
spection: 'She is the finest yacht ever
built on this side of the Atlantic* I can
8ee nothing in the way of resistance. She
Is a marvel. This opinion is shared by
other experts who have seen the Sham
rock II."
GLASGOW, April 13.-AI1 is' now ready
for the launching of the Shamrock II, al
though this evening men were working at
the yards of the Dennys . under "Watson's
vigorous eye giving the final touches to
the craft. Sir Thomas Lipton, when asked
what he thought of his new boat, replied:
New Yacht, According to Ex
perts, Is a Remark
able Boat.

PAPERS IN RACETRACK
DEAL FILED FOR RECORD
â¢An effort on the part of Riordan and
Lande, counsel for the executors of the will
of the late Julius Friedman, to settle the
final account J of their clients- in Judge
Troutt's court yesterday was successfully
resisted by Attorneys Houghton and Jo
seph Rothschild and a continuance of the
case was ordered. Houghton and Roths
child, on behalf of certain heirs of the de
ceased, object to various items on the ac
count, and as the vouchers were not on
file they, had no, opportunity to file' their
specific objections. -
.Rothschild and Houghton also objected
to the hearing of the case on the ground
that they had leceived no regular notice.
In ansyer to this objection'Attorney Rior
dan said: .
"We have received. written notices from
about twenty attorneys and verbal notices
from fourteen more that they , were corn
ing into the case, each claiming to repre
sent the only-true and ligitimate heir. It
is apparent 'that the majority of these
claims are frauds. - Â¦ .
"We do not recognize attorneys who
represent other than the devisees under
the will of the deceased and the attorney
for absent heirc," Martin Stevens. It has
been stated i here that if sufficient time
was not granted other counsel to make
their objections to. this account it would
place the court in bad odor. | Mr. Stevens,
whose duty it is to care for the interests
of the court, -I believe, is fully. capable of
performing tthat duty."
Attorneys Rothschild and Houghton in
sisted on further time, and Judge Troutt
put the case over to the, day named.'

limited to a consideration of the necessity of
a "temporary" appointment and the qualiflca
tlona of the proposed appointee, and I think
its position is clearly right. To such board
has been given full power to determine what
clerks and employes ara necessary for the con
duct of the business'of that department. ."With
in the limitations of ihe charter as to the dis
position of their appropriation they are ab
solute. ,
Where the Remedy Lies.
If they create unnecessary places the remedy
lies not with the Civil Service Commission,
buf ultimately with the Mayor. The, Civil
Service Commission , is created to see that ap
pointments to office and removals therefrom are
made in ctfiformity with a certain plan of pro
cedure provided. Their business primarily, is
to see that proper and fit persons are selected
as officers and employes under the merit sys
tem. And if there does not happen to be a
properly qualified person for any position that
Is vacant their consent or approval is required
to the appointment of a temporary appointee
who shall hold until an examination can be
held and a list of qualified persons so ob
tained. -. " . .
The commission may -withhold, its approval
of any temporary appointment upon the ground
that the proposed appointee is not fitted for
the position or upon the ground that a tem
porary appointment is not necessary . because,
a qualified list of eligibles is waiting from
which a regular appointment may .be made.
But the Civil Service -Commissioners should
not reject a nomination upon the ground that
In their judgment such an office or i employ
ment is unnecessary in such department. If
it were illegal to . create such a place that
would be another matter, but the case pre
sented does nut give rise to such question.
Must Exercise Discretion.
. The Civil Service Commission does not act
ministerially In giving its approval to a tem
porary nomination; it must exercise discretion
in this, that it must satisfy itself that the
person named Is qualified for . the duties of
the place he Is to occupy and that the place
to. he filled is one for which the Civil Service
Commission has no qualified list ready which
might be drawn upon. But it is not for the
Clvfl Service . Commission to say to the Board
of Public Works "we 'do not think you need
a stenographer in the building department"
and upon this ground withhold approval. .
The charter does not contemplate that the
Civil Service Commission shall be the judges
of the needs of . the various departments or
that they shall decide when public business
will suffer If a position is not filled. The Civil
Service Commission may or may not be qual
ified to decide what positions . the Board of
Public Works should create; the presumption,
however, â¢ is that the Board of Public Works
has superior qualifications in this regard, and
the responsibility for the conduct of the Public
Works Department reats upon their shoulders
end not upon those of the Civil Service Com
mission.
charter does not reauire the Board Â¦ of
Public "Works or anv other municipal de
partment to furnish the Civil Service
Commission with an' official statement
showing the need or necessity of. a
temporary ; appointee. The opinion
was reauested as a result of the. Board
of Works appointing Joseph Mogan to be
stenographer to tho Superintendent ; of
Public Buildings, after it had been-noti
fied that the commission could only certi
fy female stenographers lor appointment.
The commission, withheld approval of the
appointment because it contended that
it alone had the risht to determine the
necessity for the- creation of --positions. .
l^ane holds otherwise, however, and after
quoting the character on tho subject ad
vises as follows: ,
The Board, of Public Works claims that the
power of Â¦ the Civil Service Commissioners is
limited to a consideration of the necessity of

changes . of more importance will shortly
be made. . â¢
The Chief, after an investigation, be
came satisfied that the men who are sta
tioned in the park were not attending. to
business and he decided to assign them to
other beats. . " "'Â¦ / Â¦"â¢*-. -- â¢:.-. : .
Chief Sullivan refuses to discuss the
various changes except to say that they
were made for the "benefit of the depart
ment. . Notwithstanding his reticence It
is Known that his object in removing thÂ»
men who have been doing prison duty was
to stop the. "graft" that has been going
on for some time. Recently he became
suspicious of the actions of some of the
men who have been transferred and he
started an investigation. Failing to gather
sufficient evidence against them he con
cluded to make an entire change with
the exception of Sergeant Melody and
Floorman Murphy.
*Â« S * m< Mi. m ? f^i *Â¦ Pri son er complained
to the Chief, that tic had been forced to
deliver up a. check for a small amount of
money to an attorney. He implicated one
of the officers of the prison, but as It was
his word, against the policeman's 'nothing
was done about the matter. : It is known
that the Chief has long suspected a Police
Court practitioner of getting "tips" con
cerning men -who were locked up from thÂ«Â»
officers in charge of the prison. Frequent
ly when the names of suspects were reg
istered on the "small" book the attorney
in question would m some manner learr*
of their arrest and hfe would lose no time
in seeing them unless he was prohibited
by Captain Seymour. Satisfied tbat some
body attached to the prison was giving
out the names of'the prisoners who were
locked up in the "tanks" Chief Sullivan
decided on the present changes. -_ ,
Negligence in failing to patrol properly
their respective beats is attributed for the

Considerable surprise was created !n
police circles yesterday when it became
known that Chief Sullivan had decided to
change the desk sergeants and keymen,
who have done duty at the City Prison
for many years. "Rumors of corruption
among the men who were about to be de
posed spread with rapidity and many
anxious inquiries were made. It was
even hinted "that the Chief had decided
to release, several of the officers of their
Btara without the formality of a trial by
the Police Commissioners. â¢. . .

Carried Knock-Out Drops.
Fred Ranquest was booked at the City
Prison yesterday on u charge of having
knock-out drops In h!s possession. He
was arrested Thursday on Montg-omerv
street by Detectives Ryan and O'Dea and
booked for vagrancy. When searched a
oottle of knock-out -Iroos was found in
Iiis pocket and Dr. Morrison of the
Emergency Hospital said there was
enough poison in the drops to kill a doz^n
men. Ranquest was Â« friend of Charles
Lowell and Eugene Cliereghino, who were
arrested and convicted last December for
breaking into 2316 Caiitornia street ai:d
3617 Taylor street, but nothing could at
that time be proved against him.
What the New York Central and Hud
son River Railroad Company Is
: Doing, for California and
. '.. -Her Products.
Mr. Carlton -C- Crane, Pacific Coast
agent of the New York Central and Hud
son RiVer RaHroad, is in possession of a
considerable quantity of literature sent
out by General Passenger Agent George
H. Daniels. Mr. Crane calls attention to
the manner in which Mr. Daniels is en
deavoring to bring to the attention of the
Eastern public the various attractions
California has to." offer in' the way of
scenery, as well as in the richness of her
products. Among the items is a very elab
orate menu card, showing the service In
the dining cars' of the New York Central
lires. On every breakfast bill henceforth
will be shown California navel' oranges,
Oregon apples, stewed California prunes,
and on all menus will appear California
winesâ :"Cresta Blanca," and -"Ktlro," a
California, grape - fruit product. The
luncheon and dinner, menus will have Cal
if ornia : ripe ; olives, California navel or
anges ; and : ;Oregon apples. .The 1 supper
bills will have California ripe olives; Ore
gon apples'stewed California prunes; Cal
ifornia fruits in' syrup and California na
vel oranges. ....
This Â¦ constant reiteration of California
products'ln theimenus of so extensive a
system, as, the New > York Central lines
cannot fail. to be immensely advantageous
to the. coast. . Mr. Crane states that Gen
eral Passenger Agent Daniels advises him
that the company Is in receipt of numer
ous letters from clubs and from private
individualsâ travelers over the New York
Central . linesâ asking the addresses of
persons handling California wines,
' Ivitro ' and other, things to which atten
tion fas' been called in S the company's
cars. .. â¢ , - > '
The company's officers feel very much
pleased that their efforts in this line have
met with such success. During the Pan-
American Exposition at Buffalo the New
â¢Yorla Central , line will naturally be the
great 1 highway, over which the bulk of
travel will reach the e3fi>osition; and pas
sengers by that , route will always be as
sured of the most perfect service, every
convenience being . accorded them en
route, and the attaches of the company
at Buffalo ; being ready to provide them
with all information at their disposal re
garding Buffalo and its surroundings.
CALIFORNIA CAREFULLY CON
-SIDERED.
"That is the most remarkable mass of
human wrecks I have, ever seen as wit-;
nesses," said Judge .Conlan, after the ad
journment; of the court.
"Those are the best and most intelligent
we could pick out.", remarked hia brother,
the resident physician. . ,- .
It is not probable' that' any of the wit
nesses heard yesterday could be taken to
court to testify on the final hearing of the
case, so the Superior Judge to whose de
partment the Guinee case is assigned will
nave to hold -. court at the Almshouse.
Whether Guinee's, plea of ' self-defense
avails or not, he Â¦will always be ; a public
charge until death'ends his sufferings.
One or two witnesses will be examined
this morning at the Hall of Justice by
Judge Conlan when the case will be called
for decision.
Attorney Webb announced that the pris
oner would not go on the stand In his
own defense at the present time. But
little cross-examination was given the wit
nesses, there being but slight variance in
all their testimony. .
as they endeavored to check the flood of
reminiscences the old man was willing to
tell. Finally, after a few questions lead
ing up to the matter, Williams asked the
court, to let him tell his story In his own
way. and he ' succeeded well. But when
it came to getting him to repeat the words
that Smith used, he proudly held up his
head, answering, "I'll not foul my mouth
with them, your Honor." As no manner
of persuasion would induce him to repeat
them, there will be no record of them in
his testimony. With a profound bow to
the court and spectators the old man was
led out and to his ward, to recount. his
experiences over again. Â¦
Dr. W. E. Conlan. the resident physi
cian of the Almshouse, described In detail
the wounds that caused Smith's death.
They numbered something over twenty
of all sizes and characters.
Â«^ â
In view of the probability that Acting
Police Judge Long will to-day dismiss the
charge of forgery against Daniel J. Sulli
van on the J. Evans order for the return
of bail money, on account of the testi
mony of J. O. Reis, cashier In the Treas
urer's office, Judge Cabaniss yesterday
swore to a complaint before Judge Con
lan charging Sullivan with , a similar
crime. .
Sullivan is accused of forging the name
of the Judge to an" order for the return of
$1640 bail money deposited by Wong You on
March 13 for the release of Lee Quoung
and eighteen others charged with conduct
ing and visiting a fantan game. The
money was drawn from the Treasurer's
offico on the forged order, but Sullivan
delivered the money to" Wong You. The
Judge signed an order for the return of
the money a. day or two later and it was
handed to Sullivan. It is supposed he de-
St Sull1van'was before the Grand Jury yes
terday, but positively declined to answer
any questions p* to him regarding the
allwred forgery ol orders for the return
of bail money. Sullivan ascribed as his
reason for his refusal to answer that his
attorneys had advised him not to do so.
When he was asked whether his refusal
was because his answers might tend to
incriminate him Sullivan again declined
to reply. He was before the Grand Jury
for a short time only, and as no informa
tion could be elicited from him, he was
excused from further hearing.
Arthur Mack, the attorney, was also
callet! as a witness, but the Grand Jury
htd as hard a time getting information
from him as it had from Sullivan. Mack
could not remember the names of several
clients, who. it is alleged, lost their bail
through Sullivan's J manipulations. The
name! of several people said to have re
tained Mack as their attorney were men
tioned, but Mack pleaded profound ignor
ance of them, saying that he never re
membered the names of his clients.

hpfnre Tnde-P CYinlan v<=>Â«:tprrlav aftpr
before Judge Conlan >esterday after-

the struggle between Daniel Guinee
and Richard B. Smith on the 5th inst..
which resulted in the death of the latter
on thp fniinwins- iftprnnnn ("Jninpp i<! nn
law compelled the holding of a prelimin-
ary examination.
Aged, decrepit and paralyzed were all
the witnesses called. Guinee, himself a
cripple, being short of a leg and unable
to move except on hands and knees, sat
stolidly through the hearing without ut-
tering a word or casting a glance at his
former roommates, who with one accord
weakened minds could conjure. All ap-
peared sincere m detailing the circum-
stances surrounding the affray that oc-
curred in the room above the one in which
Conlan held court.
All the paraphernalia of the court was
transferred to the Almshouse from the
Hall of Justice. Clerk Rice -brought his
calendar with him. Judge Conlan his dock-
et, and Bailiff Laws solemnly announced
the opening of court. Deputy District At-
torney Harris conducted the prosecution,
while Judge Watson H. Webb defended
the prisoner, Guinee was brought from
the City Prison in a patrol wagon by De-
tective Crockett, who swote to the formal
complaint, and by Bailiff Laws. As the
prisoner was practically unable to assist
himself the officers had to carry him up
and down the steep hills in the Almshouse,
grounds. . .......
The advent of the court was a cause of
great excitement to the inmates, and ap-
parently will be a story of wonderment
for many days to come. Faces lined every
window as the ambulance bearing the offi-
cers of the law slowly wound its way up
the grade to the building occupied by the
incurables.
Thomas Magner was the first witness
called. He was borne in on the back of a
fiercely grizzled-bearded attendant, who
staggered under the weight of his bur-
den. Magner is paralyzed and his feet
were inclosed in blankets. He was placed
in the witness chair and his pale face
glowed with the excitement of the occa-
sion. He was a friend of the prisoner,
and told of the circumstances leading up
to the accusing of Guinee with murder.
The Story of the Murder.
Briefly the story is that Magner was
reading a morning paper in the room
above that in which court was held and
in which the tragedy occurred. Smith,
who was paralyzed on his right side, was
lying m bed, a bottle of water hanging.at
Ug hea<J Guinee had crawi ed in from an
other ward and was listening to the read
ing of the paper. Smith frequently inter
rupted the reading by profane remarks,
Guinee remonstrating. Finally Guinee
crawled across the floor and raised him
times in the face with his left fist and
Guinee retaliated. Smith reached for the
water bottle, but Guinee secured posses
fion of it and belabored Smith over the
J^^net awtÂ£ an^n^as^
ance During his absence Guinee returned
to the attack, jabbing Smith several times
with the ragged edges of, the bottle, which
had been broken on Smith's head..
]anguage ul ed by Smith which:led to the
assault, and described in detail the strug
gle, alleging that Smith struck the first
blow, was the first one to bring the bottle
into play and which was afterward used
with deadly effect by Guinee. The witness
was carried out of the improvised court
room on a chair.
Edward Joseph Hall, bearing the weight
of over seventy years on his shoulders,
brought all his personal belongings into
court wrapped in a red bandana. These
he carefully deposited on the floor beside
him, and furtively watched between ques
tions and answers. Hall was the man
who pulled Guinee away from Smith dur
ing the early part of the affray. He ex
pressed a marked unwillingness to repeat
the language used by Smith, saying it' was
"too filthy." While he ambled away to
call assistance Guinee had completed the
beating, and crawled away from the bed.
The witness therefore knew but little of
the assault. . .
Wong Sing, a Chinese paralytic, was
next called in and answered intelligently
all questions requiring monosyllabic an
swers. He was a little confused when it
came to more intricate answers, but by
the exercise of considerable patience a
fairly good account was given of the af
fray, corroborating the.evidence of the
other witnesses. He designated the prison
er as "him" and Smith as the "dead."
"By the grace of God, sir, I'll be eighty
nine, come next October;" responded John
Williams, the last of the witnesses from
the incurable ward who were able to give
an intelligible account of the affray,
Others saw it but their minds are blank.
Would Not Repeat Profane Words.
"I was born in October. 1S12," responded
Williams, and he was questioned by Judge
Conlan and Prosecuting Attorney Harris,
At this point in the case there was re
newed scurrying among the assembled
brokers. The case rested and was con
tinued until next Friday for argument.
"There are four or five of my associates
to whom I loan money," concluded Cur
taz. "I charge them interest."
"Have you made it a business to loan
money to your associates and exact this
rate of interest from all?"
"Did you charge interest on the loan?"
"Yes: I charged 2 per cent a month and
took the interest out in advance," calmly
answered Curtaz.
McCalvy was in court to press his suit,
however, and was at once placed on the
stand. He testified as to his services, the
performance of which is not disputed by
the defendant, and left the stand. Oscar
11. Curtaz was the next witness. As he
is operating as a broker in opposition to
the various firms throughout the city, he
decided to stay in the game and refused
to revoke his power of attorney. He held
the power of attorney, he said, as secur
ity for some $68 loaned McCalvy.
"How came you to loan this money to
McCalvy?" asked Atorney Louis P.
lioardman. who represents Auditor Wells.
"He asked me for the money, I loaned it
to him and took his note for the same.
Then I exacted a power of attorney,"
answered Curtaz.
McCalvy Presses Suit.
When the case was called for hearing
yesterday there was considerable scurry
ing among the brokers. The brokerage
firm of Bier & Regensberger also hold a
claim against McCalvy by virtue of a
power of attorney issued last Dectoiber,
but as McCalvy did not work during the
month of January they have not as yet
collected their money. Hawley & Nottage
were also on hand to prevent. If possible,
the money f_or which they hold an assign
ment from falling: into McCalvy's hands.
They also wished to stop the case before
it reached a decision, for the- Supreme
Court has held that no valid assignment
for moneys not yet earned by the assignor
can be drawn.
In his answer Auditor Wells set up as
a. defense the fact that McCalvy had as
signed his warrant for - the .month of
March, during: which McCalvy served as
extra' clerk, to Hawley , & Nottage,
brokers, and also that Oscar H. . Curtaz
had presented a power of attorney, signed
by McCaJvy, authorizing Curtaz to collect
the moneys due for McCalvy*s services.
Curtaz was forced to make his admis
sion when called, to the stand as a'wit
cess in the action' Instituted by George A.
McCalvy for a writ of mandate to compel
Auditor Wells to audit his claim for %*)
for services rendered as extra clerk. j
Forced to Make Admission.
Oscar H. Curtaz. cashier In the office
of the Tax Collector, admitted In Judge
Seawell's court yesterday that since he
assumed the duties of his position he has
augmented his income by running a
brokerage business, with his associates In
the office as patrons. Since Tax Collector
J. Harvey Scott took possession of his
office it has not been a fruitful source for
professional brokers â those â¢whom the law
recognizes and for which recognition a
license fee is exacted. Curtaz. in direct
violation of the spirit of the charter. If
not its specific provisions, has been op
erating as a broker and has paid no li
cense, lie asserts that he only loaned
money at interest to four or five men in
the office, but the brokers by profession
claim that this staement is not in keeping
with the facts, and that Curtaz has taken
all of the Tax Collector's office business
away from them. Curtaz did not admit
that he was operating with the consent of
Tax Collector Scott; neither did he assert
that the Tax Collector, who is his broth
er-in-law, was ignorant of his operations.
Testifies That He Holds Mc-
Calvy's Power of
Attorney.
