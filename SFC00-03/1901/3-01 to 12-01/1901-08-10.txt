W.. TVASHIXGTON. Aug. 9â Apparently
there is a serious hitch in Peking in the
signature of the Chinese protocol which
will terminate foreign intervention in
China.
Sir Ernest Satow, the British Minister,
has objected to several clauses in the
protocol, and to the proposal th'at the
tariff question be- referred to a board of
experts at Shanghai.
The facts in possession of Acting Sec
retary Adee regarding the latest phase
of Peking trouble are thus set forth In
an official statement made to-day:
"A cable dispatch received from Mr.
Rockhill late yesterday reports that the
delay in the signing of the final. protocol
of the agreement between the power's and
China is due to objections raised by
Great Britain . against .an .international
commission for the revision of the tariff.
The nature of the British objection is, not
stated., It also appears that the British
Government asks a reconsideration '- of
some clauses, as to which no agreement
had heretofore been reached, owing to the
Special cable to The Call and New York Her

PITTSBURG, Pa.. Aug. 9.â There were
gravely important developments In the
strike situation to-day. The United States
Steel Corporation moved decisively in its
Etrlke campaign with a peremptory order
directing that the great Dewees "Wood
plant at McKeesport be dismantled and
removed to the Kisklminetas Valley.
President Gompers of the American Fed
eration of Labor, after a two days" con
ference with President Shaffer and his
associates. Issued a formal statement to
night specifically pledging the federation
to the moral and financial support of the
Amalgamated Association. His written
review of the train of events leading, up
to the Industrial quarrel sustains tbe
course of the Amalgamated Association
and declares that nothing remains for
labor but to battle for the cause of union
ism.
The official announcement of the order
to dismantle the Wood plant came this
afternoon toward the close of an other
wise uneventful day, and its importance
was such that it claimed the serious con
sideration on either side of the great in
dustrial conflict now being- waged here.
Persifer F. Smith, department manager
of the American Sheet Steel Company,
made the formal announcement in the fol
lowing statement: ,
"I have orders from President McMur
try of the American Sheet Steel Company
to at once tear down the Dewees Wood
plant Â«t McKeesport and remove the same
to Kiskimlnetas Valley. This I shall pro
ceed to do immediately."
Surprise at McKeesport.
The publication of the order was a
great surprise, and McKeesport received
it at first with doubt. Actual preparations
were made later in the day for the dis
mantling cf the mill and there is little
room for doubt that it will be torn down
snd taken apart, piece by piece. The
strikers beard the order in a spirit of de
fiance. They simply said that it showed
the steel corporation was convinced that
It could not reopen the plant in the face
of the opposition of the Amalgamated As
sociatlcn. Strike leaders here said that
the order was a bluff that had been
worked unsuccessfully before and declined
to take it seriously. A representative of
the press showed District Manager
Smith's statement to President Shaffer,
tut after reading it he declined to talk
abcut it.
The rtpel officials declined to give any
reason for the order, but it is openly Btat
ed here that the pronounced sympathy
cf citizens and city officials at McKees
port with the strikers is responsible for
it. It is also said that the plant of the
National Tube Company at McKeesport
will \h- abandoned and the old Carnegie
plan for a tube plant at Conneaut, O'iIo,
revived. The National Tube Company
had in contemplation improvements at
McKeesport of an extensive nature, but
it is now Paid that owing to their disap
pointment at the fact that their men have

So the night ride was taken. Muffled

Veale went to Lees and demanded why
he had been given the double cross/and
said he wanted possession of Winters.
Lees replied:
"I will give him to you when I am good
and ready." :
Veale answered that he would get a
warrant for Winters and prevent Lees
holding him in custody. Lees was wild
with rage and shouted at the top of his
voice:
"I dare you to do it, by God!"
"Why didn't you tell me what was do
ing here to-night?" demanded Veale.
"Because tue newspapers have
hounded us in the city; they even had
the nerve to follow us In launches . over
here. We found one of them on the wharf
at Selbys, where we want to pick up the
detectives, and then when we came up
here to Crockett they followed us here
and are hounding our footsteps."
"I don't care what the papers are do
ing," said Veale. "They. arc. supposed to
get the news, and it is right that they
should get It. I have worked up all the
evidence in this case and turned it over
to you, and now you have thrown me
down and are trying to get all, the glory

to have associated with Winters.
PETH DONALDSON IS , -
QUESTIONED
To-day Detective Tom Gibson and Con
stable Moiles made . a careful measure
mtnt "of the tunnel and hole beneath the
bullion safe. They were strong in their
opinion that the man *who planned the
robbery was perfectly familiar with the
modus operandi of taking gold and silver
into the boiler plate room. The width of
the door of the safe- Just allows for the
passage of the narrow truck on which the
bullion is moved around the building and
cairied into the safe. The robber calcu
lated to a fraction of an inch just wher#
the wheels of the truck would pass along
the floor of the vault. If he had miscal
culated in boring through the bottom of
the vault he would have weakened the
snet and the heavy weight of a passing
truck might have broken - through the
floor. "The man who did the tricK,-" said
Gibson and Moiles this morning, "was just
as familiar with the safe and how gold
was placed, in it as any one in the build
ing." Â¦ â¢ , . -
the framework made by the thief to hide
the entrance to the tunnel would be
supported and kept in place. Many holes
are to be found in the planks that form
the side of the building, these holes hav
ing: been drilled with an auger just above
the edge of the hole where the robber
crawled beneath the .walls.
CROCKETT, Aug. 9.â There. is a big

It was thought that a fresh start wculd
be made to the spot where Winters Is
supposed to have hidden the stolen geld.
Minute after minute passed and no sign
of intended action was made by the de
tectives. Gibson .was left on the tug to
see that no information was obtained
from the -tug men and Gibson himself
claimed that Seymour and Lees had told
him nothing of the reasons that called
for the trip of the party on the tug.
Shortly before midnight a positive assur
ance was given by some of the detectives
that no start would .be made until day
light and the hotel men then admitted
that Seymour and- others had left orders
to be called sharp at 6 in the morning.
Winters was taken In through the back
entrance and* smuggled into a suite of
rooms on ths top floor, usually occupied
by the hotel proprietor. â¢
A few* minutes after this the gang
plank was run out and Lees, Seymour,
Von der Ropp, Crockett and "Winters

ters were purchased and when, they hope
to be able to prove that Winters was the
man who purchased 'them. ::."â¢.
The search of his cabin also disclosed a
painter's- "salamander," ordinarily, used
for blistering paint. The- discovery Â¦ of
these two articles lead the officers to be
lieve'that'Winters secured. them, for the
purpose of . cutting away any iron -bolts
that- might, have been found on the.bot
tom of the safe. The "salamander" would
have been used to make the protruding
bolts red hot and the bolt- cutter, would
have been: utilized to cut the bolts away.
The bolt cutter is of black iron with
bright steel jaws. It is just two feet long
and bears the following wording on one
side: Porter's easy bolt clipper. Rlgiit

-Just as carefully as the cracking of the
Selby bullion vault was planned, so the

thought out in advance how to dispose- of
the stolen gold bars.
This morning ex-Chief of Police "Lees
departed for San Francisco, taking with
him the large pair of bolt cutters found
in the cabin of John winters, alias "Buck
Taylor." The detectives are anxious to

the tide was flooding strong, even till the

bay for the tools that were used in. cut

in the vicinity of the smelting works.
They ? expect, if able to find these tools,
to show -that they were taken' from the
navy yard and belong to the Government

ready to obey the Labor Council -should

Governor Gage said last night in con
versation with a well known politician
that he had come to- San Francisco mere
ly to keep in touch with affairs.
Mayor Phelan informed the Governor
that the authorities were fully able to
cope -with the situation thus far, and that
he did not apprehend serious trouble in
the settlement of the issues involved. The
business interests of the city demanded
that a settlement be reached as soon as
possible, and it was to avert further dam
ege to the said interests that he had un
dertaken to act as intermediary between
the strikers and their employes.
pÂ»yi^HE subject of the strike and the
|| best means of bringing order out
j| of chaos were topics which en-
H gaged the attention of Governor
Gage and Mayor Phelan yester
day. The two executives met at the Pal
ace Hotel during the day. and for nearly
en hour they were closeted in earnest dis
cussion.
The Mayor referred to the fact that he
â¢was unable to effect a compromise be
tween the disagreeing factions because
of the firm attitude of both employers and
strikers. The employers demanded that
they be allowed to settle with their em
ployes without any dictation from the
unions, while the strikers declined to
come to an agreement until the right of
the unions to look after the interests of
their members was recognized. Owing to
this divergence of views, the Mayor said,
an immediate settlement of the strike
Eeemed impossible of realization.
Arrangements have been made with the
Park Commissioners for the use of their
sprinkling wagons. The two sprinkling
wagons now in use on the county roads
will also be pressed into service. It is the
intention of the board to use the carts
and wagons now employed in the Bureau
of Streets for the removal of the sweep
ings to the bunkers. These carts and
wagons, without exception, are driven by
owners and therefore no trouble with the
labor unions is anticipated.
Secretary Park of the Board of Public
Works said yesterday that it was the in
tention of the board to employ only men
who own teams. He stated that the
board had a number of men working In
the Corporation Yard with their own
teams and that the union had as yet mads
no objection.
Although the sweeping and sprinkling
of the streets has only been Interrupted
for two days, the thoroughfares of thts

TO THE HONORABLE JAMES D. 'PHELAN,- MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CITY HALLâ Sir: The Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco earnestly calls your attention to the condition affairs of this city and to the absolute necessity of prompt and decisive
action to avert the loss of lives of its residents, the threatened destruction of its industries, the restraint of its commerce, and to that which
threatens the inalienable and constitutional right of it^ citizens to liberty of action and protection in their lawful pursuits.
Believing that the interests of the community will be best served by an official proclamation from you that no man has the right to
liinterfere with another in his pursuit of any lawful occupation, that acts of intimidation and violence must cease, and that as chief executive of
the city you will preserve the peace and properly protect one and all, we therefore urge upon you to issue such a proclamation.
It appears to the Chamber of Commerce that in your exalted official position you can improve the present situation and safeguard
the future by stating, in unqualified terms, that violence will not be tolerated; that, at any cost, men who work will be protected, and by making
it clear that the city is responsible for every dollar of damage to person or property through riotous disturbances.
It is also necessary to provide means for continuing and increasing the protection the authoritiesr are rendering the community in its
attempt to conduct its affairs. ~ V
if the laws and finances of this municipality do not admit of an immediate augmentation of the police^orcel^te^^-shouldUat once be
taken to call upon the properly constituted officers for State aid.
By order of the Board of Trustees. (Signed) GEO. A; NEWHALL, President.

The bandit asked for the treasure box.
but was told by Cassenelll that nothing
of value was on board. He did not inspect
the stage, and after ordering the driver
to proceed disappeared in the brush. On
the stn?e was one valuable express?pack
age >Â»ddrejÂ«!Â»ed to Mrs. G. H. Mastick of
Pan FranpJpco.
The bandit appeared to be something oC
an amateur. Over his head and conceal
ing his face was a heavy sack with eye
holes. He handled his -weapon nervonslv
and his famous old dime-novel command.
"Tour money or your life," waa spoken ?n
a tone that betrayed his newness at the
business of stage looting.
â¢ The driver. Louis Cassenelll. prudently
hastened to comply with the robber's de
mand and threw Into the roadway the
few dollars he had In his pockets.
SAN ANDREAS, Aug. 9.â The driver of
the Sheep Ranch stage was pretty well
out on the road from this town this morn-
Ing, when a masked highwayman stepper!
from a clump of hushes and with leveled
shotgun told the man on the box to de
liver the treasure. There were no passen
gers aboard and little In sight In the line
of valuables.
The more perlous aspect of the matter
was nresented' In the press dispatches
from Willemstad. stating that Colombians
again had Invaded Venezuela. There was
no official confirmation as to this, but If
it should prove correct there seems little
chance of avoiding an open conflict be
tween these two countries, as such an In
vasion by Colombia would be In Itself an
act of war. But the authorities here pre
fer to tike a conservative view of tho sit
uation until official advices are in hand.
Â¦\\"he\Â» inaulry was made as to why our
officials at Bogota and elsewhere did not
send full information on the subject It
was stated that these officials were not
there to communlcrile news, but only to
advise this Government as preliminary
to any official action which might becoroa
necessary.
, At the Navv Department no further
steps were taken toward sending ships
to the isthmus. Tt waÂ» decided definitely,
however to send the battleship Wiscon
sin down to San Diego, Cal.; In case, the
desirability of that move became evident
by the time she reached San Francisco,
and the State Department was so advised.
There was some comment also as to the
possibility of sending down some of the
ships of the North Atlantic squadron, but
Acting Secretary Hackett treated the sug
gestions as rather premature. There Is
no doubt, however, that an ample force
will be sent from the, squadron if Its ores
ence seems desirable."
WASHINGTON. Aug. 9.â The situation
In Colombia and Venezuela continued to
occupy much of the attention of the offi
cials here to-day, and while It was not
felt - that affairs had reached a serious
aspect, yet it was appreciated that both
the official and unofficial advices Indicated
a condition of affairs which might mean
war between Colombia and Venezuela,
complicated by revolutionary outbreaks
In both countries. During the day the
State Department received a lengthy mall
communication from Consul General Gud
ger of Panama, and though this was
dated nearly a month ago it told of the
landing of a revolutionary expedition and
expressed the current, belief held at Pan
ama that this would be followed by other
expeditions. The department also received
a letter from J. Edward Simmons of New
York, president of the Panama Railway
Company, confirming his communication
of yesterday relative to the trouble on
the isthmus and stating that the superin
tendent of the road had advised him as
to the depredations of an insurgent band,
which did not number, however, over
fiftv men. -

Even the flirt demand for the scale to be
applied generally throughout the Jurisdiction
of the company was commendable for the
obvious reason that an employer should be
willing to Pay a uniform waÂ« to men who

demand for those whom It did not fully repre
rent the Amalgamated Association modified Its
demand to the extent already stated.
It appears that the company took the \>osl

allow the extension of - the union to non

Judge Noyes admits that In most cases
where he appointed receivers the repre
sentations made to the court were largely
untrue as to the capabilities of the mines.
This, however, was not determined until
later, and his action was predicated upon
the fairness of the presentation of the
cases. This, he says, accounted for the
comparatively excessive expense of op
eration by the receivers. He also claims
that as an additional precaution for the
protection of the parties in interest he re
quired in all cases when either of the
parties requested it that the gold dust
realized by- the receiver-- should be depos
ited at the safe deposit vault, not subject
to withdrawal except by order of the
court, with notice to the parties interest
ed, and also that he further ordered in
each, case when requested that all parties
having any interest or claiming interest
in the property mierht at any time go upon
the property worked by the receiver for
the purpose of observing the work, and
might be present at each and every clean-
Ing up made by the receiver, and that he
in even* way oonslble tried to throw
everv safeguard about tho pronerty in the
hands of the receiver, that !t mlerht be
conserved for the benefit of the party who
might finally be adjudged its owner.

He then details his efforts to organize
his court, and the importunities to which
he was subjected by litigants and coun
sel, and describes favors that wero at
tempted to be thrust upon him by solicit
ous individuals. He recounts the cir
cumstances under which he appointed
Alexander McKenzie receiver of certain
mining claims, alleging that it hart not
been prearranged that McKenzie should
act as receiver, but McKenzle's name was
suggested along with others by one to
whom the place had been tendered tWore
i*. was offered to McKenzie. The. Judge
reaffirmed the wisdom of that choice and
compliments McKenzie's administration
of the property. Defending his appoint
ment of a receiver for the placer mining
claims, he denies that he first suggested
that remedy, and justifies his action upon
the ground that there were scattered
along the beach thousands of unemployed
men, Â¦who had been allured to Nome by
the fabulous tales of wealth which had
been given out; that these men were un
employed, without food or money and des
perate, and that to have closed down, by
injunction the operation of the placer
claims would have been to have added
largely to the number of unemployed in
the camp. He says that he followed In
this respect, the precedents established by
former Judges of the district of Alaska ,
and adds copies of a decree in a similar
case.
â¢WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.âThe Depart
ment of Justice to-day made public the
answer of Judge Arthur Noyes . to the
charges preferred against him in the ad
ministration ol his office of United States
District Judge at Nome, Alaska. Judtje
Noyes details the story of his .trip to
Alaska, giving an account of the ac
quaintances made upon the journey, more
particularly the acquaintance of Messrs.
McKenzie and Chipps, who have figured
so largely in connection with the charges
against ' the . Judge, and denies that he
had any communication with these gen
tlemen with respect to the business of his
court on his journey or at any other time.
He takes up in detail the various charges
against him and specifically denies each
and every allegation thereof. He de
scribes the chaotic conditions existing at
Nome at the time of his aniva], wherein
he states he found in the neighborhood of
20,000 people of all classes, and the utmost
confusion and disorder prevailing-. He
sets out that every lot of the sroand in
the whr.le town had two or more claim
ants, that possession was held in a great
many instances by armed force and that
he was besieged upon every, hand imme
diately vipon his arrival'by parties seek
ing relief against those whom' they
claimed to be wrongfully and unlawfully
in possession of their property, divesting
it of value and shipping the proceeds out
of the country and the jurisdiction of the
court.

J. H. Curtoni, engineer of the tue Mil

wanted to send a message to his wife, and
went into the saloon on the corner of Pa

sponse to a request from central he
dropped his nickel and then waited pa
tiently for an answer. None came, and
Curtoni rang again, only to be told the
line was cut of order. Then he got mad
and wanted his nickel back, but central
told him to call again. Curtoni called
again with hla fist and smashed the tele
phone Into bits and scattered the nickels
and slugs all over the floor. The saloon
keeper called the police and the officer
found the engineer on his hands and

PARIS, Aug. 9.â M. Santos-Dumont,
finding that the envelope of his
balloon has sustained so much
damage that it is inadvisable to
sew it together, | has ordered a
new one, -work on which has already .
begun. It will have about tne same vol
ume as the one which burst yesterday,
but Instead of being cylindrical In form
it will be elliptical. M. La Chambre"? who
is making it, constructed tne balloon for
the Andree polar expedition. He promises
that the new t envelope will be ready Sep
tember 1.
The accident yesterday was bad enough,
but not nearly so bad as first' flying
rumors had it. Santos-Dumont was not
hurt, but only his astonishing coolness ,
saved him from death. In fact, Dumont
was infinitely cooler than the thousands
that -quickly surrounded him. As Soon
as he found himself safe he asked for a
cigarette, which he lighted. Dumont, In
the -ascent, wore a religious medal given
to him by>the Comtesse "d'Eu, daughter
of the late'Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil.
Half jokingly, half reverently, ..the aero
naut kissed the medal, saying: "It:, was
that that saved me." '. â¢- ' .S
Prince Bonaparte; Lieutenant Noix and
other skillful aeronauts have not lost faith
in the balloon's ultimate success, because
they perfectly understand the cause of the
accident to itâ the failure of the motor to
pump air to fill the inner balloon so as to"
compensate for the gas which had
escaped, and-so keep the balloon taut, in

The Oregonian arrived at Coronel" on
July 13, and passed the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company's Talca hard and
fast on a pinnacle of rock at the entrance
to the harbor. The Taica was a brand
new vessel on her maiden voyage. She
was built by Beardmore & Co. of Glasgow
and went into commission last December.
She was 1018 tons gross burden, 209 feet 9
inches long, 35 feet 1 inch beam and 15 feet
6 inches deep. She was a twin-screw ves
sel of 1000 horsepower and was used as a
feeder to the company's vessels running
between Valparaiso and San Francisco.
The Talca was making for Coronel in a
fog, and the lookout mistook the light
house for a ship at anchor. The vessel
ran on a cluster of pinnacle rocks at full
speed, and when the people on the Ore
gonian saw her was sitting up as though
she had been built there. She went on
at high water and in a few minutes the
waves were bilking over her. A boat
was lowered and a line made fast to it.
The boat was driven ashore and the line
secured by people on 'the beach- One of
the 6hip*s mooring lines was sent ashore
and on it a breeches buoy was rigged.
The crew went ashore in it. Captain Bur
goin being the last to leave .the vessel.
When the tide went out the people of
Coronel could ride and drive around the
wreck. Captain Williams says the Talca
will be a total loss.
cargo. She made the run via Mon
tevideo, Straits of Magellan and Coronel
in seventy-three day?, and would have
been here ten days earlier had it not
been for a slight defect in the machinery,
â¢which compelled Captain Williams to put
into Montevideo for repairs. The work
was done by the vessel's crew and she got
away again for San Francisco after a four
days" stop. In consequence of the delay
the Californian, which left New York
twenty days after the Oregonian, was
only ten days behind her at Coronel.

A little good luck went with their ef
fcrtu in the second. Nordyke got to the
second station on Devereaux's error, and
Jimmie Sullivan gladdened the hearts of.
the fans with a clean drive which brought
Nordyke in. But alas for the Wasps!
their hard work netted no more runs, and
they were forces to accept the short end
of the three to one score. Hoffer, the new
Eastern man who wears a Sacramento
suit, covered first base. He had no chance
to distinguish himself in the field, but
failed to do anything sensational at the
bat. ' Sheehan accepted a hard chance of
Hildebrand's liner in the seventh, and
both McCarthy and Hildebrand pulled
down a. scy scraper. Â¦ Following is the
score:
The Germans began the game in real
earnest. With one out, Hildebrand sent
a fly to center, McLaughlin falling in his
attempt to capture it.' This put "Hildy"
on the third cushion, but he was caught
soon after in an attempt to come home
on Schwartz's bunt, ;

sess a "glass arm," did great work for a
man who la afljieted in such a manner.'
He was such a puzzle to Â¦ Hank's men
that only three hits were registered
against him, but he had Dame Fortune
on hia side, and was thus enabled to carry
ofE the spoils, which Evans deserved to
win. Two of the Lawmakers went the
r jute in the second. Doyle got ! to first
on/ Cro-tl's error, Hotter accepted a free
pass, and; both men went up a peg on
Stanley's sacrifice. And here is where the
fireworks commenced. , Sheehan hit a
grounder to Krug, who first fumbled it
and then - dropped it, letting Doyle and
IiofTer amble home. The next two were
easy outs, though Sheehan stole third
during the mixup.
During the next round Bill Devereaux
sent a nice little one . to right, kept on
running until he Â¦was near third, when
Nordyke threw the ball over Reilly'a
head, and the man with the auburn locks
crossed the rubber with the third and last
tallj which his- team secured. All this
time Evans was pitching phenomenal
ball, not a safe one being obtained oft him
while the run getting was going on.
Henry Harris, the kind and indulgent
uncle; of .the German ball tossers. has
good and \; sufficient reasons to be
thoroughly; ashamed of his pets on" ac
count of the miserable support which they
gave Roy Evans . yesterday afternoon.
Evans ' certainly pitched the game oÂ£ his
life, allowing but two safe hits, and forc
ing five of the. heavy hitting Senators to
fan the "air. But with all this great work/
victory failed,, to come ; the way of the
locals, and two straight games have gone
to swell 'the average of the men frojn
the Capitol. City. *â¢>. â¢
Krug and Nordyke are the two men re
sponsible for San Francisco's defeat.
Krug played; ball much after' the fashion
of a wooden Indian, and Nordyke handlfed
the sphere like'- a hot potato. Outside of
theso two, the rest of the team performed
creditably,, with the possible exception of

Anxiety.
SEATTLE, Aug. 9.â The friends of Don
ald McKeracher, who, prior to last Fri
day, was receiving teller at the Seattle
National Bank, have asked the police to
look him up. McKeracher is missing
from his home, though his absence may
yet be explained. He has been missing
since last Monday.
McKeracher has been with the Seattle
Natioi'al Bank for the past four years.
Last Friday he was given a vacation for
two months, with the understanding that
at the end of that time, if he was in
proper physical condition, he could re
turn and get his old position. His pav
was to continue. At the bank this morn-
Ing President Andrews denied that there
was any suspicion connected with the
case. MoKeraohpr told his mother that
hp was going to Taroma to visit friends
and not to exppct him home for some
time. But to others he is said to have
made different remarks, and this is what
has given rise to uneasiness.

has been obtained to establish this. For
instance, it is said that in that province
fifiy-four of the constituencies, which in
clude part of the city of Toronto, show a
decrease of about 1S.O00 in population, yet
ihe families are increased by about 13,000.
This, it is said, is proof that the figures of

a decrease in the population, while the
families and the dwellings show a con
siderable decrease.

PRINCIPALS IN A, DIVORCE CASE
WHICH .PROMISES TO ATTRACT
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION.
The petition declares that the City
Council has exceeded its jux-lsdlctlon In at
tempting to set aside the award of the
board of arbitrators which fixed the value
of the water plant at $1,183,591. Thla
award, it is contended, was approved by
an ordinance duly adopted and which has
never been repealed. The City Council.
It Is asserted, has no authority to disre
gard this award and allow the water com
pany {2,000,000 to be raised by a bond is
sue and $1,000,000 of accrued profits that
has accumulated in the treasury since lit
igation placed the company in the hands
of a receiver and tied up the receipts. It
is further contended that this $2,000,000 is
sue of bonds will be in excess of the debt
limit fixed by the city's charter, and
therefore illegal. The case will be tried
before Judge York on a date to be fixed
later.

"There is a grave doubt in my opinion
whether, under the peculiar wording of
the statute, the court had Jurisdiction.
This question, however, the court de
cided. At any rate it seemed to me that
the House of Lords proper, -which was pre
sumed to try Lord Russell, had nothing
to do whatever with the trial excent to
aid In its splendor. .The Lord High Stew
ard, with the assistance of the Judge,
not only tried the Earl,' but fixed the pen
alty as well. From the former's own
statements one would be Irresistibly led
to the conclusion that the legal questions
involved had been prejudged. Lord Hals
bury would state his view of the law.
Then he would ask the other Judges if
that view was correct and they would an
swer that it was. As to the penalty I
think that under the peculiar circum
stances of the case a. sentence of one day
woud have been sufficient. It would have
vindicated the law as much as the sen
tence of three months."
"It was an Impressive proceeding be
yond my expectations. In this country
we could nqt and would not have such a
brilliant assemblage. Almost all the lords
were there and in their seats, dressed In
their scarlet robes, trimmed with ermine.
A number of Bishops were present, in
white flowing sleeves, contrasting with the
Judges, in their gowns and wigs, -ranged
in front of the Lord Chancellor, who was
Lord High Steward. The Peeresses, still
dressed in mourning for Queen Victoria,
were at one end, to the left and back of
the Lord High Steward. All was very
solemn except when Lord Halsbury at the
close broke his wand of office. The first
time he tried his knee slipped. He finally
broke it on his knee. â¢
NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â Judge B. F.
Curler of the Second Judicial District of
Nevada, who was to be a witness in the
Earl Russell bigamy trial and who arrived
here on the steamer Majestic, has given
a reporter his . impressions of that cere
mony. Admission to the trial was ex
tremely difficult to obtain, and Judge Cur
ler said, that so far as he knew, only
four Americans were present, Embassador
Choate included. He said:
All the water this evening from the Red
ding mains is Impregnated with oil, and
although disagreeable the discomfort Is
felt less from, a consideration of the con
tention that the oil will destroy all
mosquito larvae on the Sacramento from
Redding to the bay.
These desirable features ot llfo along
the stream have been brought about
through an accident. Through the ignor
ance of a workman with the Mountain
Copper Company at Keswick, the contents
of a car tank of crude oil was pumped
into a storage tank that could only receive
a third of a car tank. More than two
thirds of the crude stuff ran Into Spring
Creek and on Into the Sacramento River.
It is now spread over the river's surface
and Is rapidly making Its way to tide

In a recent issue of a medical journal, an editorial, written exclusively for physicians, says: . "Something more than an |
external irritant is required.to produce hay fever. Country people are surrounded by a pollen-laden atmosphere; the fields are full |
of ripening grasses, the ever-present rag weed grows in luxuriance, the golderirod blooms by every roadside, and their pollens float 1
on every breeze, yet nearly all the hay fever victims are from the populous centers and of a class shut up in the study, the counting |
|| house, the factory, or store, where the atmosphere is as free as possible from plant dust." ' â¢ ' 1
j| The results of treatment go to prove the same fact, that the real fault is with the individual, that hay fever is a systemic or gj
I constitutional disease rendering one particularly susceptible to the influence of substances that' have no unpleasant effect on healthy |
j& and constitutionally right folks. . . , -. ; ; . : |
i Local applications alone never did and never will cure hay fever. /Most local remedies, that give relief, contain cocaine that 1
I deadens the affected tissues and lulls the more distressing symptoms to temporary rest, but must be resorted to so frequently as to, \
|H each season, fasten the dreadful cocaine habit on a considerable percentage of hay fever victims . ti
13 To cure hay fever we must not rely on the local tinkering of mere symptoms but address remedies to the deep-seated consti- I
1 9 tutional cause that permits of the local irritations. Â¦ â ..';Â¦ . , . . . * P
1 1 he only real cure for hay fever > a^ the onlv true cur e for catarrh, consists in so influencing the system by internal or con- 1
|| stitutional treatment as to enable it to withstand, and be immune to all plant dast irritants. Correct the constitutional weakness .1
II that allows of the disease, by proper internal treatment, and, like healthy folks, you will not have hay fever. , â¢ - 1
til There is one remedy that will do this; will so alter, strengthen and fortify the system that it will be proof against pollen 1
II poisons. It is the same remedy that has cured so many thousands of catarrh by building them up out of a systemic weakness that Â§
HI permitted of catarrhal conditions. ' ' ',. . .V ' p
|| vStuart's Catarrh Tablets if taken in time will render the system resistant to hay fever, and one will no more have it than do 1
III other people who are equally exposed to plant dust. . II
H To wholly escape hay fever one must begin the tablets some time before the attack usually comes on. If one waits until the I
IH disease is already manifest/to take the tablets, they will relieve to some degree, and, in a measure ward off the disease. ft
jp Begin early, get your system thoroughly under the influence of the tablets and in perfect condition to resist influences that M
H do not affect healthy and constitutionally right people; escape the annual vexations and miseries that attend hay fever, stay at Â§
H home among your friends attending to life's duties and pleasures, and enjoy the beautiful Summer and Fall months, when all nature i
Hj rejoices and normal folks are happy and content. . â¢ . ,. m
r^ All drug stores sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at 5a cents a box. They contain 1 no cocaine or opiates, so common to hay fever 1
H remedies, and are safe as they are reliable and satisfactory. Try them and be convinced. We will send booklets about hay fever 1

Compositum mlraculi causa" is Latin
quoted from the works of Tacitus, the
famous Roman historian who lived about
A. D. 53-117. The words mean "a narra
tive made up only for the sake of the
wonder which it may occasion"; one of
those fictions the object of which Is less
to Inform than to startle, the reader. From
this H would seem that yellow journalism
dates back to that early period.

â¢When- a market is attained by such methods let it
be understood that it can be held and made perma
nently profitable only by continuing the means that
have- captured .it. Commercial honor, fidelity to
trademarks when once established, and treating the
consumer in good faith, are the only means of holding
a market. One attempt at deception, once putting
inferior goods under a superior label, 'will destroy in
a year a market that has been conquered by many
years of honest effort. There is a profitable market
in the world for every pound of first-class California
fruit, andfor every pint of first-class California wine
and brandy. This market is quite unaffected by hard
times, since the people', who want these things are
always able to pay for them. . \
Germany has been expanding her foreign trade by
doing just what* the Secretary of Agriculture pro
poses to do. Scientific attention and the bringing
of trained minds to the assistance of the producer ac
count in great part for Germany's success in com
peting with England. ; It is now proposed that the
Agricultural Department induce the fruit-growers
to entrust the picking, packing and preparation of
their product for export to scientific oversight, in
order that by commercial honor and intelligent study
oLmethods they may capture a, market. To* induce
this, risk is transferred from the producer to the Gov
ernment. Not many producers will avail themselves
of this offer, but their experience will enlighten the
entire mass of producers, who willbe equally bene
fited:
Our meat products did not appeal to the foreign
market until foreign packers came to this country
and cut the meat in such packages and cured it in
such a way as made it acceptable to the trade abroad.
One great bar to our export trade is the failure of
the American exporter to study his market. He is' in
the habit of preparing his product in a certain way
for the home consumer, and if the foreign consumer
does not like it that way. he. can let it, alone.
THE proposition of the Agricultural Department
to make practical study of foreign markets for
fruit, and of the preparation .of the product to
meet the taste of the consumer, is perhaps misunder
stood. ; â¢ .r.-*

of history, is" he not carefully guarding
himself against being In any way a par
tisan ? In dealing with students, does not
the teacher study above all things to
maintain a strict impartiality? Is he not
continually careful of the religious sensi
bilities, of the children : committed to his
charge? Is not the teacher usually found
holding a prominent position in . the lit
eraryr historical and scientific societies of
the place in which he lives? Can the pro

has been interesting in many ways. The
lectures of Professor Stephens have been
masterly throughout. On Monday last, as
indeed on several previous occasions, the
class broke out into prolonged applause.
His thorough mastery of detail, breadth
of view, felicity of expression, and, above
all,, his exquisite, sense of humor have

also of such general subjects as expansion

t PERSONAL MENTION.
A West Virginian was fined $5 the other day for
cursing a trial jury which could not agree upon a
verdict. Since it is reasonable to suppose that the
punishment fit the crime it is hardly necessary to ad
monish reputable people not to hazard their interests
in the keeping of West Virginian juries.
It must not be supposed that those who believe the
increase of speed to be due mainly to the improvement
That breeding and training have immensely bene
fited the American trotter is not to be doubted. It
is asserted that at the beginning of the nineteenth cen
tury there was not a tbree : minute horse in the United
States, while now we have something like 17,50b trot
ters with records of 2:30 or better. The improvement
naturally enough has advanced most rapidly in late
years. It ; took twenty-five years to reduce Flora
Temple's record of 2:19^ to 2:10' with the old high
wheeled sulky, but since the introduction of the bike
sulky the time has been lowered by trotter after trot
ter, until now the horse that. will reach, the. coveted
two-minute gait is thought- to be almost in' sight.
One of these experts writing for the Philadelphia
Enquirer states the case in this way: "The sulky that
Lady Suffolk pulled in her record of 2:29^ weighed
95 pounds. The sulky that Flora Temple pulled in
her record of 2:1954 weighed 65 pounds; the one that
Maud S pulled in her record of 2:o8j4 weighed 48^2
pounds. They were all high- wheel sulkies. The" bike
sulky that Nancy Hanks pulled in 'her record of 2:04
weighed 40 pounds; the. one The Abbot pulled in his
record of 2:03% weighed 20 pounds. It has always
been conceded by all practical horsemen that the dif
ference between the bike sulky weighing 40 pounds
and the high-wheel sulky weighing 48^ pounds to the
average horse is 4l4 to 5 seconds. Nancy Hanks'
record of 2:04 to a 40-pound 'bike' sulky is 4J4 sec
onds faster than Maud S's record of 2:o8& to high
wheels. Now, any genuine trotting horse man admits
that the difference between the high wheels and bike
is from 4 J /j to 5 seconds, which places Nancy Hanks
on an equality with- Maud S. The sulky The Abbot
pulled in his record of 2:03^ weighed half as much as
the one that Nancy Hanks pulled, and his record is
three-quarters of a second faster than Nancy Hanks'.
Now, the whole thing is in a nutshell. . Does the
weight that the trotter pulls when making extreme
speed count or not? If weight and friction don't,
count, then the trotting horse is S X A seconds faster,
than he was fifteen years ago. And if weight and fric
tion do count, then the trotter is about where he was
"in speed' fifteen years ago.. And you can't make
anything else out of it. Facts don't lie, and you
can't smother facts with theories."
CRESCEUS' wonderful performance in lower
ing the trotting record has naturally" given
rise to a good deal of discussion as to the
probability that we shall have a two-minute trotter
within the near future. Some experts, accepting the
record of Cresceus when compared with that of for
mer trotters as an evidence of the immense advance
which breeding has produced in the speed of trie
American horse, calculate it will not be long before a
horse will be bred who can make his mile in an even
two minutes. Other experts insist that the increased
speed shown by trotters of late years has been due
not to the breeding of the horse but to the improve
ment of the sulky.: They even go so far 'as to in
sist that it is doubtful whether Cresceus could; beat
the record of Maud S if he had to pull the old
fashioned sulky.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
EDITOR SAN FRANCISCO CALL: "A Workman," it
appears to me, fails to comprehend your editorial on the
equality of incorporated labor and incorporated capital.
Wherever there is organization there is power, and
wherever there is power there is potential abuse. This
was soon recognized when capital appeared In corporate form,
and the law immediately began to hedge corporations around
not to destroy their power for good but to limit their. power
for evil. Legal responsibility followed them steadily and in
the process expanded into the gTeat body of the law of 'cor
porations, which the. courts daily enforce. Now labor organ
izes as eld capital. Is it likely that the resulting power will
be always used so wisely that it needs no legal restraint?
The employer of labor, corporate or individual, cannot
evade responsibility. He must keep his contracts and agree
ments with his employes and his customers and creditors
because the courts make him.
But a labor union has no legal standing. It may make a
contract to-day and break it to-morrow at will. But the same
contract can be enforced in the courts against the employer.
As I understand your editorial, it was to advocate, equality
of legal responsibility between the employer and the labor
union.
The members of a union' can â¢ now destroy an employer's
business and prevent his use of his plant and property and the
law offers hfm no remedy. . --
As for the contracts which "A Workman" says are "always
kept by the union, look at the agreements madeand signed in
this city and broken by the unions and their members. Look
again at the same kind of contracts made In the Eastern steel
mills and ordered broken by President Shaffer, who says to the
union workmen that their oaths and obligations to the union
precede and are more binding than their contracts. This is
claiming a power to vitiate contracts that the constitution
denies to the States and a power that the courts themselves
cannot exercise, except on the ground of good conscience and
public policy.
Employers do not oppose organized labor. They approve it.
But they oppose and will resist to the end the attempt to use
the power of organization ,to destroy their control of their own
business. It is not a question of wages nor of hours. Tho
lawfulness of a purpose may be judged by the lawfulness of
the means used in its accomplishment. Will "A Workman"
insist that It is lawful to use violence and intimidation to pre
vent a non-union workman from getting employment and
earning his bread? Is it lawful to compel a man to join any
society or organization before he is allowed to support himself
by labor?
Have the police ever been called on to protect onÂ© set of
employers against personal violence from another set? Has
it ever been necessary to call on all the police in the city to pro
tect union workmen against personal violence by non-union
workmen or by employers?
Is there anything more pitiful in the day laborer carrying
his lunch back home to be eaten in idleness than in tho work
men in this city who violated their written agreements with
their employers at the order of the walking delegate and quit
work -With no grievance and wept as they did it?
Employers will submit to no more invasion of their right
to do business by a legally irresponsible power. Let responsi
bility to the law equal the power that is assumed and they
will know where they stand. We cannot have a higher law
than the law of the land, which impairs the obligations of con
tracts at the dictation of Mr. Shaffer, Mr. O'CoWll or Mr
Casey. We are not striking at- labor unions, but at extraor
dinary power unrestrained by law or responsibility "â¢ ttaor

THE economic section of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union, in session at Pacific Grove,
has been enlightened by several learned men
on social snd economic questions. Professor Fowler
of the State University finds all existing industrial and
social conditions subject to indictment and trial on
several counts, and to sentence to public ownership of
public utilities as a remedy. In his view such solu
tion is to immediately happify labor and put the
demon capital in a close cage, where he can do no
more harm to the world. The public ownership of
all the large utilities is the rule in those parts of
Europe where labor is the unhappiest and the most
anxious to escape. We are receiving our largest, and
probably our least welcome and least desirable, im
migration from countries on the continent of Europe
where these experiments in state paternalism have
gone the farthest. If public paternalism is capable of
taking the spider out of labor's biscuit and lifting
from its back all burdens, the tide of immigration
should be from this country instead of to it. Human
instinct seems a more reliable guide than the misdi
rected intelligence of men. Nothing is easier than
to dream a Utopia. Fourier, Gronlund and Bellamy
have created ideal conditions in their dreams, but
wherever the attempt is made to concrete those ideals
and put them in every day practice one may look for
the very centers of human discontent.
American advocates of public paternalism go fur
ther than is proposed in Europe. One of the speak
ers at Pacific Grove recognized the advantage of the
trusts in economizing production, and, as they were
a good thing that far, in his estimation, proposed that
they be passed around by the government assuming
ownership and administration of their business. This
means public ownership of the metal, textile and ma
chinery manufacture of the country, and the prosecu
tion of all those industries as a public enterprise.
The only industry left out of this generous pro
gramme seems to be the tilling of the soil. Just why
the government is not to be the only farmer in the
country as well as the only railroader and manufac
turer is not made clear. If Uncle Sam can hold the
lever of a locomotive, make cloth, machinery and
steel ingots, why can't he take in hand the plow and
pruning-hook and produce anything from prunes to
spuds?
There is no instance on record of permanent bene
fit to any nation or people that sought contentment
in any of these experiments; Trials of artificial
schemes in finance, industry and other things which
normally are the evolution of natural causes have
always failed to bring the results promised by dream
ers. Men have rushed to the place where these rain
bows touch the earth to dig for the promised pot of
gold, but have never found it. They have returned
to the old way of work, thrift, temperance and eco
nomy, and, walking therein, have continually bet
tered their condition and added to their basket and
their store.
Wise men prefer to depend upon themselves to get
their share under conditions that make it their own
rather than run the risk of sharing all with the lazy,
thriftless and drunken in a state where everything is
everybody's.
â¢ Once more the rumor has been sent tfroadcast that

"EMPLOYER" REPLIES TO "WORKMAN" AND DECLARES
UNION MEMBERS HAYE VIOLATED THEIR AGREEMENTS
THERE is every prospect that an American will soon be
come master of the royal palace, Osborne House, Isle of
Wight. * "- .
. King Edward has determined to get rid of it for two
reasonsâ its, inaccessibility and the fact that it costs $60,
000 a year to keep up. The latter is, of course, the more im
portant reason in the estimation of his Majesty, whose econom
ical trend has been shown by the sale of sherries H from the
royal cellars and by his discharge of the old retainers of the
late Queen Victoria.
At first the King decided to sell Osborne House outright,
and it was then understood that William Waldorf Astor would
pay for it any price his Majesty might name. Mr. Astor's in
tention was to present the famous royal residence to his
daughter on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of Rox
burghe.
There is, by the way, a hitch in the arrangements for this
wedding because of the Duke's objection to the stringency of
the marriage settlements.
His Majesty's private lawyers, however, called his atten
tion to a clause in the will of his mother, Queen Victoria, un
der which he was only given a life title to the palace. It was
the late Queen's favorite residence. At Osborne she relaxed
the royal etiquette; "cut out all formality and became quite
neighborly .with the folk in her vicinity. There she delighted
In entertaining her old friends informally and in storing her
favorite books and hric-a-brac.
Finding he could not sell the palace. Kins Edward deter
mined to lease It, and hia advisers were Instructed to loo*
around for a lessee with "good money." These advisers have
decided on an "American millionaire" as the most likely to
appreciate the tangible and sentimental value of the property,
expressed by the conversational powers of the realm's coin In
appropriate and necessary proportions.
Senator William A. Clark of. Montana is anxious to leasa
the palace, and It Is said he has written to the Kins asklns
him "how much he will take."
Another millionaire ambitious to walk with the feet of own
ership where royalty loved to tread is Charles T. Yerkes. Mr.
Yerkes some time ago publicly stated that an American mil
lionaire could not lead a desirable life in America: that Eng
land was the only field for true money domesticity, and that
he intended to select for himself a quiet residence "among the
green lanes of Albion," or words to that effect. He sees his op
portunity in the lease of Osbdrne House, and he, too. Is ready
to pass to his Majesty a check for the desired amount.
Mr. Astor Is still a bidder, though the hitch in the marriage
arrangements of Miss Pauline Astor may lead to hesitancy
on his part.
The old servants of the late Queen could very likely bÂ« pro
cured by any of the millionaires and the royal atmosphere bÂ«
thereby preserved.
KING EDWARD FINDS THE LATE QUEEN'S FAVORITE RESIDENCE AN EXPENSIVE OLD PILE AND IS ABOUT
TO LEASE THE PLACE. .' IT IS SAID THAT EITHER WILLIAM. WALDORF ASTOR. CHARLES T. YERKES
OR SENATOR W. A. CLARK MAY BECOME THE LESSEE..
The subject is worth the attention of. the Pacific
Commercial Museum, since the King's project seems
to offer an opportunity to extend our trade in Asia.
The directors of the museum might at least encour
age his desire to visit us by assuring the President
that if he will invite the King San Francisco will guar
antee him a royal welcome.
The reception of a royal personage always entails
a great deal of expense and no little trouble and an
noyance to American officials, but in this case it would
seem to be worth while undertaking it. There is a
considerable demand in Siam for the products of civ
ilization, but at present nearly the whole of that de
mand is supplied from Europe. Still, American trade
is making considerable progress there. The corre
spondent of the Record says: "The stars and stripes
have not been seen in the harbor of Bangkok for
over six years, but American commerce is finding its
way there, and her products are commending them
selves in competition with the cheap stuffs that flood
the Orient. Japan has opened her doors to Ameri
can goods, and the ways of Japan are the ambition of
her little sister. All of this makes the King the more
desirous of knowing the United States."
Americans residing in Siam are reported to be de
sirous of having the King make a visit to this country,
as they believe it would have the effect of promoting
trade. Consequently they will make an effort to get
the President to extend an invitation to his Majesty.
If the tour be arranged the King will come in his own
yacht to San Francisco, and from this point will travel
as the guest of the United States.
The Bangkok correspondent of the Philadelphia
Record in discussing the intention of the King says:
"He appreciates -that for one monarch to visit the
realm of another means an invitation from the sov
ereign host, and more or less recognition on the part
of the Government to which he is of necessity in the
position of a guest. He at the same time appreciates
that with our republic it must be quite otherwise, and
while he fully understands this and would be glad to
go to the United States ( in a' private capacity, if he
could do so, for the sake of the education it would
be to himself and to his people, he feels a fear that to
go in such a manner might be regarded in Siam as in
dicating something of hostility, or, at least, indiffer
ence, to his country." . â¢
His Majesty, it seems, is the more- particular on
the subject of his reception by reason of certain mis
representations which were made of his tour of Eu
rope some years ago. He wishes to guard against
similar misrepresentations or misinterpretations
should he visit us, and accordingly there will have to
be a good deal of diplomatic work done in arranging
for the visit. . . . . Â¦ /
HAMILTON KING, United States Minister to
Siam, is reported to have been informed by
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that king
dom that. King Chulalongkorn would like a pay; a
visit to this country in the near, future. It appears
he is to visit Japan next year,, and would be glad of
an opportunity to extend his tour to the. United
States, but he does not intend to come unless he' can
be sure that he will be received in a way that will not
lower him in the eyes of his people.

Without further delay every Republican should ob
tain a list of the delegates nominated by the Republi
can League Club in his district and carefully com
pare it with the tickets offered him for voting on
election day. The only way to beat the bosses is to
vote for the candidates nominated by the Primary
League. A vote cast for those delegates will be- a
vote for true Republicanism, honest politics, a strong
ticket and good government.
. Only a few days intervene between now and the
date of the primaries. They should be days of activity
among the better elements of the Republican party.'
The bosses are active and are working day and night
to rally every voter, whether he belong to the Kelly
or to the Rainey push, so that they can swing the
whole crowd at the Republican primaries. It is a fore
gone conclusion that the vote at the Democratic pri
maries will be light. Nearly the whole body of the
touts and toughs that support the bosses of that camp
will this time help Kelly and Gage and Herrin to
capture the Republican nominating convention. That
is the danger that confronts Republicanism.
That the bosses will resort to all sorts of falsehoods
and trickery for the purpose of deceiving the unwary
is to be expected. Dirty politics is their element.
They delight in it and would practice it even if there
were no profit in it. Consequently voters must be on
the lookout for frauds on election day or before.
Doubtless many a Kelly heeler will pretend to be an
anti-boss candidate on election day, and will seek
votes by such misrepresentations. Men who have not
posted themselves on the course of the campaign
may be deceived by such tactics, and accordingly
every genuine Republican should make sure that he
has the right ticket when he goes to the polls.
No stanch and stalwart Republican can donsent to
yield the party to the control of such men as are now
gathered around Kelly; nor would any independent
citizen ' support a party that should consent to such
a surrender. A Kelly victory at the primaries would
mean a Republican defeat when the municipal elec
tion takes place. The whole issue of providing San
Francisco with good government is therefore at stake
upon the Republican primaries. That fact should not
be overlooked by any citizen. The issue is clean cut
and Republicans must face it.
Kelly and Herrin and Gage have formed a com
bination for the purpose of controlling the politics
and the municipal administration of this city. They
have brought to their aid the State machine, the water
front push, a gang of bosses from other counties, a
part of the Federal brigade, the slum element that
follows the heels of Kelly, the Southern Pacific crowd
that is dominated by Herrin and the followers of the
Democratic boss, Sam Rainey. By the aid of those
forces the bosses hope to carry a sufficient number of
districts to give them control of the convention.
Should they succeed they will put into the field under
the Republican name a ticket that, with the excep
tion of a few men nominated to give it respectability,
would be wholly under boss control and would mean
anything rather than good government.
â¢"Â¦"> OMPLETE nominations have now been made
I by district clubg of the Republican Primary
â * League, the names of the candidates have
been duly published in The Call of yesterday, and now
the issue that confronts genuine Republicans is that
of electing every man on every district ticket.
â¢ No one can mistake the question submitted to' the
Republicans of San Francisco in this contest. It is
that of determining whether the party is to be self
governing and maintain honest politics, or is to sur
render to the control of bosses and'become the sup
port of predatory politicians.

Phelan and Hearst are at outs. The lat
ter's newspaper is sulking and seeking re
venge for real or fancied slights. Hearst
is putting up a scheme to astonish and
confuse the Phelanites. The scheme is a
Hearst ticket, with Judge James G. Ma
fj-ie for Mayor. In the gubernatorial
election of 1893 Maguire was savagely
knifed in San Francisco by the political
supporters of Mayor Phelan. The latter
was elected and the former beaten out of
sight. The Cail is Informed that Maguire
has agreed to run for Mayor. It is com
mon belief that Phelan can have the reg
ular nomination for another ' term. The
question is: Docs he want it? One day he
says that he has made plans for a pro
longed sojourn in Europe and will not ac
cept the nomination. The next day he
savs that he is "in the hands of his
friends." Maguire running as an inde
pendent candidate would give Phelan,
holding a regular nomination, a pretty
good race, but any Republican above the
yellow grade would beat either. The
schemers in the Hearst camp are now
casting about for a suitable candidate for
District Attorney.
James G. Maguire for Mayor.
The desperate bosses of the Republican
party are now appealing for assistance to
Boss Sam Rainey and the Democratic
push. Without Democratic help they will
not be able to carry a single Assembly
district in San Francisco. Kelly is em
ploying his energies night and day to save
himself from the overwhelming disaster
of defeat in his own district. The ele
ments of bossism are also combining with
the vain hope of defeating Republican del
egate tickets in the Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth districts.
Affairs in the Democratic party are In
such a tan^l? *hat many Democrats have
resolved to get into the Republican camp,
some to reni'-in and others to stay only
until the next municipal election. The
Phelan-McNab- county committee is a
close corporation. The vote getters and
victory winners of the party have no rep
resentation in the councils of the fold.
The patronage is bestowed where it will
minister most to Mayor Phelan's vanity.
It is no wonder therefore that Democrats
of the Jeffersonian standard are disgust
ed. It is hard, however, to fancy a disci
ple of Thomas Jefferson leaving his party
to take service under Kelly and Crim
mlns. Doubtless most of the high-minded
Democrats will stay away from the polls
or vote under solemn protest for the dele
pates named by the Phelan organization.
The push politicians of the party, who
take orders from Rainey. are expected to
vote the Republican boss ticket. In his
desperation Boss Kelly may give orders
for his Rainey rounders to go to the polls
early and vote the names of registered
Republicans. Election officers should be
on their guard to prevent fraud of this
kind.
Appeals to Boss Rainey.
REPORTS from every Assembly
district in San Francisco justify
the prediction that a very large
Republican vote will be cast at
the primary election next week.
Politicians who have studied the contest
from the beginning of the fight assert that
a large vote will prove disastrous to the
allied bosses. Kelly, Gage. Crlmmins and
Lynch expected at the outset to secretly
rally all their followers a day or two be
fore election and win out through apathy
of the citizens. The organization and
rapid expansion of the Republican Pri
mary League astonished and demoralized
the bosses. In casting about for help they
appealed to the Republican State Commit
tee, and that subservient instrument of
the Allied bosses surrendered a sufficient
number of proxies to enable Boss Kelly
to veneer the Tilden County Committee
with the State brush. The coat of var
nish did not deceive. The Indorsement of
the State organization did not add re
spectability to the committee. The clumsy
trick of Judge McKinley in presenting to
the meeting of the State body a typewrit
ten Indorsement which was prepared the
day before the committee met simply
amused the members. The roars of mer
riment which followed the reading of the
words "after listening to argument" at
tested the utter worthlessness of the rec
ognition. The bosses were not helped by
the interference. The effect of the meet
ing was just the reverse of. what the po
litical manipulators hoped for. It was
seen at a glance that McKinley of Los
Angeles, the Postmaster of Santa Rosa,
Walter Parker of the State Board of Ex
aminers and other lights of the State
push were brought to San Francisco to
boost Boss Kelly in his efforts to gain
control of the municipal government. The
citizens resented the meddling of out
siders in local affairs and expressed their
resentment by joining the Republican Pri
mary League.

NEW TORK, Aug. 9.â Bradstreet's to-mor :
iow will say: Despite some irregularity, due
to the recurrence of corn damage news in
the majority reports from the Eastern surplus
producing States and the formal launching of
the much-heralded general steel workers'
Etrike, the aggregate business the country over
eeems to be good, and in most sections in un
precedented volume for this season of the year.
Changes, where noted for the week, have been
rather of tone than of actual demand, and it
\f In this matter of sentiment that the favor
able developments have arisen. All available
measures of supply, demand and movement
point to the business done in July as having
exceeded anything transacted in any. similar
midsummer month. This, too, despite the ex
ceptionally hot weather, drought, strike talk
and similar conditions unfavorable to tfuslness
extension. . - ' . â¢'...'â¢
. Cereal prices have been rather irregular, but
the main tendency has been upward, partly
because of renewed crop damage reports as
to the corn crop, "frosts" having already be
gun to be sighted by nervous crop estimators.
The main strength of wheat, howe^r, lies In
the continued heavy export business, the clear
ances this week being, enormous and far In*
excess of any previous week on record and
the rather smaller volume of. receipts of winter
wheat.
New features are scarce in the iron and steel
trade. The strike is still the great, central
feature around which revolve high premium
prices for plates, bars and sheeting and tinned
plates. Black sheets i will . be imported and
tinned here. Structural material, not affected
as yet by the strike, is in very heavy demand
and producers are being- hard pressed to meet
orders. ' : â¢ -

sorts, have been liberally ordered.* Wool' is

NEW YORK. Aug. 9.-From a condition of
decided etreng-th Jn the early dealings the
market began to show an exhaustion of the
buying power and prices declined gradually
until the final hour, when there was an effec
tive bear drive against the grain carrying
roads. This movement was based on surmises
thst the Government's monthly crop report
to be issued to-morrow would reflect greater
damage than current expectations. This fup
pcsitlon was also effectively backed by the
crtimate of a recognized expert who predicted
a possible condition for wheat of 78 and corn
â¬0. These averages were given some credence
by bÂ»ar traders and they promptly put out
large amounts of stocks which brought about
declines in the highest prices of the day of
from % to 2%b in th<? principal grain carrying
mad* with St. Paul the chief sufferer. The
general dwline was materially assisted by a
drop of i points in People's Gas on reports of
complications with the Chicago city authori
ties, United States Steel stocks contributed
little novelty to the day s dealings and moved
within a range of. a point. Early improvements
of S Â«V>4 % respectively for the common and
preferred were wii*d out and they closed 'A

"Freight rates from England and Australia
are reported similar to last week's figures In
dicating that bottom rates have been touched
and any change from this on would naturally
show an advance. Outward grain freights from
here are ruling high, hence it makes this port
a seductive one for vessels to seek, as thesÂ»
rates will continue for several month3 to com*.
There is very little change in the oil situation,
pending the final action of the Railroad Com
missioners on freight rates from Fresno and
Kern counties."
"The deliveries of coal here this week will
be largely In excess of the present demand. If
all the industrial Interests were running full
blast we would have still received more than
Â¦would have been consumed. The quantity re
quired for consumption in our present demoral
ized condition is difficult to arrive at. When
our factories recommence the quantity of fuel
to be consumed will, be largely in excess of
our former weekly average. If no compromise
is effected thi3 month colliery proprietors in
the northern sections will be forced to discon
tinue shipments. Market quotations remain un
changed. In fact, for the moment there is no
market quotation.

NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will ,say: Strength and
speculative confidence reappeared in the stock
market after the middle' of the week, accom
panied by an . increase in the activity. The
change in this respect was- the more striking
because the week opened with a very depressed
feeling in Stock Exchange circles and prices
for Ee\-eral days declined, in â¢ some : cases in a
decided manner. | This unexpected ending of
last Saturday's conference ' between the heads
of . the , Amalgamated Association â¢ of Steel
Workers and the United States Steel Corpora
tion in a disagreement and the announcement
by the labor union that there would be a gen
eral strike instead of pacification of the ex
isting trouble was calculated to have a de
moralizing effect upon a market which had al
ready experienced a liquidation and decline on
the damage to corn crop and the strike. Bear
ish feelings consequently predominated when
the market epened last Monday and there was
heavy selling for both longs and shorts in the
rteel stocks. Nevertheless, after a time it was
seen that the United States Steel stocks were
receiving powerful support at about 40 for the
common and below 90 for the preferred. Doubts
were also cast on the ability of the leaders of
the labor movement to make good their threat
of closing the majority of the mills. This was
followed by news that the â¢ steel corporation
was promptly putting into execution its plan
of opening, one by one, its non-union mills
which had been shut down and that thus far
the plan had been completely successful. On
this the steel stocks hardened and on Thurs
day rumors that there were renewed prospects
of a settlement caused sharp advances in
United States Steel shares, the common rising
to 43 and the preferred to 92. This movement
would have naturally caused sharp advances
in United States Steel to cover shorts and In
the general -market, but the railroad list was
also Influenced in a. bullish way by independent
factors. The chief of these was the better
view the street takes of the corn crop situa
tion.

have turned suddenly to the other extreme and
demonstrate that early frosts threaten' all late
planted corn. *
Eastern shoe manufacturers find conditions
as favorable as last week, while reports from
the West are more encouraging. Prospects
continue to improve in the market for woolen
goods and as the manufacture enjoys greater
activity prices for raw material are harden
ing. Little change is sean in actual sales, but
there is a growing disposition to hold for the
better terms that many in the trade consider
inevitable.
NEW YORK, Aug* 9.â R. G. Dun & Co.' s
Weekly Review of Trade - to-morrow will say:
There is no Complaint from any part of the
country over the volume of current distribu
tion of merchandise and what hesitation is ob
served in general trade is chiefly due to the
uncertainty, as to the duration of the iabor
troubles in the steel. manufacture. Collections
continue good. Better weather has helped the
agricultural outlook, money is easy and stocks
of merchandise carried are not above the aver
age for this season of the year, particularly in
the West and Southwest. Relief is felt in all de
partments of the iron and steel industry, now
that uncertainty is ended and the position of
the contestants made clear. Now . the issue
must be determined permanently and a settled
condition will greatly facilitate operations.
Structural wire and plate mills are not affect
ed and the production of rails will not be ma
terially curtailed. Supplies of bars and tubes
will be restricted and quotations in these lines
tend to follow the advance already secured
for sheets and hoops. A bad feature Â¦ is the
increase in importation of tinplates, which had
been manufactured in sufficient quantity to
about meet the domestic demand, imports in
the last fiscal year being valued at only ?3,770,
062. against $35,746,420 ten years ago.

was rumored that the towa State report would

Chicago was steady and active, the weak
cables being offset by wet - weather in the
Northwest and bad Russian crop news. The
crowd, however, fought any advance, and the
weakness in Corn had a depressing effect. The
other markets were stronger . and St. Louis
wired: "Continental Information again very

hundred thousand bushels taken for export."

SAN DIEGO, Aug. 9.â Orders have been
received by Captain Field of the cruiser
Â¦Ranger to prepare at once for sea and to
hold his vessel in readiness to leave on
a moment's notice. The vessel has been
taking coal on in a rush and will to-mor
row take on supplies for three months
The officers are of the opinion that the
rush orders are caused by the, chance of
difficulties with the insurgents and others
at Panama,' but nothing is known posi
tively and in all probability when the
orders come they will be sealed, to be
opened after the cruiser is started The
fact that supplies are to be taken for
three months indicates that the Journey
will be toward the south. All- men-ori
shore leave were called in to-day and will
be kept closely on board until the outcome
of this morning's order is known.

nipped. After Reuben Hunt made such a
determined fight against Hendricks Wed
nesday grave fears existed in the minds
of. tennis enthusiasts that he would do the
same thins with Bell and the laurel
wreath of 1901 would be worn by. a north
ern player*. But all fears were dispelled
before the contest for the cup was ten
minutes old, for the Boyle Heights Ten

at every point of the game. The cham
pion walked away from his opponent S3
easily that }f robbed the match of much

CHAMPIONS DEFEND TITLES.
This is a summary of a session of the
City Council sitting as a board of equali
zation that lasted from 3 o'clock in the
afternoon until nearly midnight. The af
ternoon session was devoted largely to the
reduction of the assessment of the Contra
Costa Water Company franchises, and the
evening was devoted to citing Mr. Kahn
to appear and show cause why he should
not have his assessment doubled for hav
ing made some editorial remarks that the
Council did not like and the. lobby did.
Ruch made his appearance at the
meeting of the equalizers and the
valuation of the franchises of the Con
tra Costa "Water Company -were re
duced from $1,000,000 to $3000 by the
votes of Bishop, Bon, Boyer, Court
ney, , Ruch, Wixson and President
Schaffer, against the lone vote of Coun
cilman George Fitzgerald. Councilmen
Dornin. Wallace and Cuvelller were ab
sent, the reduction being made at a meet
ing held in the afternoon when these
Â¦three could not be present. An effort was
made to raise the property assessments
at an adjourned meeting held this even
ing, but this matter finally went over un
til to-morrow evening. Frederick Kahri,
the man who spoke his mind so. freely
last evening, was cit^d to appear before
the board on Monday evening and the
proposition is to . give Mr. Kahn a little
lesson upon how to treat Oakland Coun
cilmen with proper respect and deference.

EOSTON AND BALTIMORE :
DOING HEAVY STICK WORK
All the best runners left in the 'State
are quartered at Santa Rosa,, and so far
as racing material' is concerned there is
nothing lacking to make the meet a suc
cess. Of the harness division the pacers
outnumber the trotters,, especially green
pacers, of which there are a large'num
ber at present in 'this State. The most in
terest is centered in the free for all trot,
scheduled for Friday. Iora,- Monterey,
Anzellan and Alta Velox, four of the most
evenly matched trotters in the State, are
engaged and a great race should result.
There will -be three or more running races
and two trotting or pacing races each day
of the meeting. . -
A special train containing nearly fifty
horses left Emeryville track yesterday for
Santa Rosa to participate in the mixed
race meeting for trotters, pacers and run
ners which /opens Monday." This is the
first time that the xunners have been
given an opportunity Â¦ to contest over the
track controlled -by the Santa Rosa Rac
ing Association. In previous years only
the trotters and pacers have been allowed
to kick up the dust of the Sonoma County
track, and, in fact, the entire northern
part of the State put a boycott on the
runners. This year at Yreka a few run
ning races were placed on the programme
and they met with such favor by the pub
lic that P. H. Quinn, president of the
Santa Rosa Racing Association, who hap
pened to attend the Yreka meeting, deter
mined to try the experiment in his town.
The result is looked forward to by horse
men from all parts of the State.

Equity and law are superior to the personal
welfare of an individual or of the aggrega
tions of individuals, and equity and law de
mand that the personal freedom of the citi
zen, whoever he is, be made sacred and
Eecure. So long as this freedom is respected
the questions evoked in the present strike may
be left, in my opinion, to the men, employers
or employes, who are directly concerned In It
although meanwhile all citizens have many
reasons to hope and pray that brotherly love
and calm counsel will prevail both among em
ployers and employes, and that peace will soon
reign in the land.
Neither State nor fellow citizen may interfere
with my personal liberty. This is the very core
of Americanism. This Is the teaching of na
tional and Christian ethics. It is not for me to
dispute the benefits that may be believed ' to
accrue to the workingman from labor unions
nor am I prepared to say from the informa
tion that comes to me through newspapers that
in the present strike unions pretend to shorten
personal freedom of men that do not join their
ranks. ,_ But this may be ever emphatically as
serted and maintained as an Inviolable prin
ciple that however much labor unions may have
reason to widen their muster rolls, ana "how
ever much tbey have the legal and moral right
to do this through pacific and persuasive
methods.^lhey must not attempt to wrest from
men outside their ranks the right to work or
to seek to coerce them into inactivity by illegal
or unjust attacks upon their civil and moral
freedom. . .
I am layinsr down general principles of
ethicsâ not deciding the merits of any particu
lar cp.se. But while the right to enter upon
a strike Is and must be conceded as a right
belonging to the personal freedom of working
men, this must ever be demandedâ and In the
name of the same principle of personal free
dom under which men may refuse to workâ
they who cease to work must In no way inter
fere with the liberty of others who may wish
to work. The personal freedom of the indiv
idual citizen is the most sacred and precious
inheritance of Americans. The constitution
and the laws authorize it: the spirit of the
country proclaims it; the prosperity of the
people, the very life of the nation, requires It.'
Whatever the other interests at stake, that
of personal freedom of the individual out
ranks them all. and this must be sustained
even ff those are to be sacrificed.
To employes entering willingly into a strike
the matter is one of their own personal con
cern, and others have but to concede to them
their personal right to act In such manner as
they will. Men are the masters of their hands
and of their labor; the liberty Is theirs to work
or not to work, provided they understand the
consequences that follow and are Satisfied to
accept and endure such consequences. Not only
indeed is this liberty at all times theirs, but
we must furthermore irrant that occasions may
arise aad do arise when a strike, however se
rious the consequences for the workman, is a
means, and at times, perhaps, the sole means
through which rights appertaining to them, and
which* are of vital importance to their ultimate
welfare, can be secured. When it is that un
der this aspect of things strikes may be" al
lowed, or even commended, is a question to be
determined by close examination of the circum
stances of each particular strike. â¢

WASHINGTON, Ai% 9.â The Interior
Department has received a resolution
passed by the Hawaiian Legislature,
praying that Congress impose a duty on
all coffee imported from -other countries,
"and in this way protect that industry
in Hawaii and other parts of the United
States."
The resolution wilLbe forwarded to Con
gress at the opening of the next session.
It says the coffee industry In Hawaii is
now in a depressed condition and is
threatened to be abandoned on account
of low prices and the removal of the pro
tective duties on all. coffee imported into
the republic of Hawaii before the annexa
tion and the large amounts imported, into
the United States from Brazil, Mexico,
Central America and other countries free
of duty. The resolution refers to the
large coffee area, the great amount of
American capital invested there, and in
ability to compete with the low prices
where cheap labor is employed, as in the
countries mentioned.

Committee From Pan-American Ex-
Constable Moller is inclined to believe
the story, because there is no evidence
that the men had quarreled, nor is there
other apparent, motive for murder. The
men were boon companions during their
drinking bout. The suicide story Is fur
ther borne out by the fact that Dorler
had once before attempted to end his life
when he was residing in San Francisco.
He had difficulty with -his wife, from
whom he was. separated, his troubles
leading him -to try suicide. Dorler for
merly had a shoe business on Sixth
street, San Francisco. He was about 50
years of age. .Holmes is single and- about
Dorler's age. He was working as a jour
neyman, having gone to Point Richmond
from Crockett. .
"Dorler and myself had been drinking
hard, and this afternoon he made the
proposition that we should both commit
suicide. I was ready, and leaving Dorler
at his shop, went to the drug store and
bought the poison. Going back to the
shop a laid the vial down and dozed off
to sleep. When I awoke I saw that Dor
ler had taken the poison, emptying the
bottie. I ran out for a doctor. That's all
I know about the affair." . .
Constable Moller took charge of Holmes.
To that ; officer the arrested carpenter told
the Â¦ following story: â¢'
Dorler and. Holmes had been .drinking
for a week and were on- the verge of de
lirium tremens when the strange occur
rence took place at the shoemaker's shop
that led to the interference of the au
thorities. / A short time before Dorler
was found in a dying condition, Holmes
went to a drug store ahd -purchased a
half ounce vial of liquid extract of bella
donna. He returned to the shop, and, he
says, went to . sleep, leaving the poison
wherÂ© Dorler could get hold of it. When
the carpenter awoke from his drunken
slumber he saw the empty vial and then
called Dr. Warley, who at once discov
ered that Dorler was in a serious condi
tion.

f With Antonio Dorler, a shoemaker, dy

Point Richmond have a peculiar case in
hand, into which they are, probing to de

The raisins were formerly the property
of. the California Kaisin Growers' Asso
ciation, which sold them to the Pacific
Coast Company. Since the first raid the
growers' association has -favored the
niiders, and to-day it lent its? official sanc
tion to their work. John W. McLaughlin
chief inspector of the' association, went to
Madera this morning and demanded of
the packing-house people the keys of
their establishment. This was refxised.
About G o'clock to-night the Pacific
Coast people left town with a special
train of twelve cars, making no attempt
to. conceal the object of their trip. The
expedition was headed by Thomas Lynch,
Adam Mowat. C. H. Detoy and other offi
cials of the "big five" combine, but was
supposed to be under direct control of the
growers' association. Some opposition
had been expected at Madera, but none
was met with and the raisin-seekers got
into the house with little difficulty. In
spector McLaughlin took possession in
the name of the growers' association.
News of the raid spread over town in a
short time, and nearly every man in Ma
dera is said to have been at the packing
house. About 10 o'clock Sheriff Thurman
appeared and arrested about twenty
members of the party for burglary. They
were placed under bonds, which all fur
nished. They then returned and the work
of loading the raisins was continued. All
the goods in dispute were secured. At
midnight to-night the train had not re
turned from Madera. During- the trouble
with the Sheriff the train' is said to have
run out to Berenda for a few minutes.
FRESNO, Aug. 9.â The officials of the
Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin Company made
another raid to-day and captured 350 tans
of raisins stored in A. L. Sayres' packing
house at Madera. This is the third raid
within a week, the first one having been
on a house at Selma and the second in
Fresno.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
An interesting detail is the fact that
the enemy's cruiser spies secured a mass
of information regarding the âdefense
movements by picking up the home squad
ron's wireless messages.
The paper "also says the chief lesson
learned was the imperative need of swift
criosers and there was a glaring deficiency
la the home squadron in that respect. It
points out that the defense squadron's
maneuvers were practically the samejthat
v-'ould have been called on to guard* the
channel in case of actual hostilities. The
attacking fleet was inferior numerically
but superior in mobility. It held the
channel commerce at its mercy from the
declaration of hostilities and whipped the
dclenders by sections through the pos
session of swift cruisers and destroyers

The Critic urgently appeals to the Ad
miralty to double the strength of the
cruiser squadron and-to increase the speed
of the new battleships to the utmost limit
of gun end armor efficiency. â¢
LONDON, Aug. 9.â The Lookout, com
menting to-day oh the naval maneuvers,
says: . "Undoubtedly the Admiralty's rea
son for winding up the campaign in a
v/cek instead of ten days was because of
the shfficiency of unpalatable truths
forced home. They did not care for
further demonstrations in the same line.'
This action was. agreeable to the officers
of the Salvador Commercial Company,
who at once prepared to make the trip
south with their documents and their de
mands, the latter reaching half a million
dollars. It is . stipulated that the settle
ment must be made by September 15. The
party expect to arrive at the city of San
Salvador on August 25, and they believe
the negotiations can be concluded before
the expiration of the time designated.
But the American shareholders did not
pocket their losses and say nothing. As
soon as they realized what had occurred
no time was lost In bringing the matter to
the attention of the Secretary of State
at Washington. The diplomatic depart
ment investigated the case and decided
that it was a proper one for interference
by the United States Government. After
a hearing, decision was given that it was
proper that the Government of Salvador
should pay damages to the mulcted
American investors. The representative at
Washington of .the Central American
state intervened with a request. that be
fore peremptory demands had been made
opportunity should be afforded his Gov
ernment to make a settlement out of
court. .
The Salvador Commercial Company Is
the principal stockholder in a grant made
in lS94by the Salvadorian Government to
a corporation for the development of the
port of El Triunfo, on the bay of Jlqui
lisco. Four years later the Government
in its peculiar Central American way is
sued decrees which practically nullified
the grant, destroyed the value of the fran
chises, and left the American stockholders
in the air, clinging to their stock certi
ficates in desperation.
To conclude a settlement with the Gov
ernment of Salvador over "'a claim of
$500,000, A. W. Burrell, president of the
Salvador Commercial Company, John H.
Ellis, treasurer, and William Lair Hill,
the company attorney, departed to-day for
the Central American republic.

"General Butler argued this very thing
here." said Senator Tillman, "and you
know how it was answered hi 1894. I
never touched a dollar and \every one
knows it, and the people showed it by
electing me time and again, j The talk
about my being rich Is all ret, as the
records of my county and the Carolina
National Bank will show."
During the five years that the mill op
erators were making- 25 to 50 per cent
profit they did not raise salaries or re
duce the hours of their operatives, he
said, and he did not see why the opera
tives should now join the Republican
party through "commercial democracy"
simply because their employers were not
now making 100 per cent on their invest
ments. He said* he did not care to take
up the latest of McLaurin's pronounce
ments or even dignify them -with an an
swer. However, they would be taken up
at one point. McLaurin had insinuated
that Tillman took rebates on whisky.
Senator Tillman failed to see any reason
or excuse for the millmen following com
mercial democracy. He feared the trouble
was "due to the fact that they had been,
associating with northern bankers." The
native mill operatives, he said, would not
be coerced or seduced into a commercial
democracy.
The report is going- thÂ« rounds that the
mills are behind this new doctrine. I do not
believe any such report. I deny that the mills
and their owners want to xturn the State over
to the Republicans. I give them credit for
more catriotlsm and more sense. These mill
people know better and that they would run
into a stone, and that these people are not for
sale. I want to give a warning to those who
have been misled. Thera are some of these
weak creatures around, but I feel that all are
not so foolish. In 1900 we had 400,000 sptndles.
and now there are about 2,COO,C0O spindles. The
boom began when Cleveland was in the WhitÂ©
House. Cleveland did nothing to help mills,
nor did McKlnley help them. They were
built simply because they were found profit
able here; because of the nearness to the Held
and the climate. Our goods entered China on
a competitive basis pure and simple. The
cry that if we don't Join the Republican party
we will so backwards Is a humbug and a He.
It Is common sense that It we have the goods
and the prices we will sell the goods.

chant marine, which shall fly the stars

to-day had not been presented to the peo
ple in this vicinity since the days preced
ing the attack on Fort Sumter. The prin
cipal part of Senator McLaurin's audience
was. made up of fajmers and they ap
plauded liberally.
Yesterday he was missed. by the party
and inquiry was made for him by some
of the, members over the telephone, they
thinking possibly he had for some reason
returned home. There have been reports
that the deceased committed suicide, but
those. who know him best scout the idea.
It appears more likely that he met with
foul play. It is understood that only a
few dollars were found upon his person,
and it is possible that a crime was com
mitted to obtain his money.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
According to a dispstch to the Daily
Mall from Lourenzo Maraues. the Boers
are reported to have eapturÂ«d and shot
in cold Mood a lieutenant and a trooper
of Steinacker's horse in revenge for their
bfirc instrumental in shooting a Boer
despatch rider.
The Times, which fully approves the
proclamation, says: "The Boers may un
r.crsland that it is the first turn of a
new Â«crew. which is capable of putting
r>n far more severe pressure."
It appears certain that the proclamation
was wholly inspired by the Government
of Natal. Chamberlain is on ore side
praised as a strong statesman, ana on the
other hand despised as a weakling for ac
centing Natal's advice. Generally, the
proclamation is approved as a common
sense, justifiable measure, but no great
l^pes are raised by it. The Standard
fears that it is too conciliatory, and that
more severe measures will be necessary-
The Daily Chronicle, referring: to a sig
nificant statement in the House of Coru
ro^rs yesterday by Lord Stanley, flnan
Â«ia! secretary to the War Office, that
"there is nothing to justify the supposi
tion that further fresh mobile forces will
be r.^cessary." says it hopes the Govern
ment â¢Â« not falling into their old optimis
tic illusions.
The Daily News says that "This empty
thunderbolt by tired and despairing Jove
will have no effect," and it reminds the
Government while they may banish the
Boers from British South Africa they
cannot banish them from German South
Africa.
Rudyard Kipling's "Killing Kruger with
your mouth" is quoted against the Gov
ernment by the pro-Boer press to-day as
a description of the latest proclamation
by Kitchener. .
Hh War Office has received no advices
piving color to the rumor circulated by a
news agency that Lord Kitchener has
been wounded in a skirmish with the
Boers. The rumor Is officially discredited.
Lord Kitchener's official dispatch reached
the War Office this afternoon and con
tained no reference to any accident to
him.
The preliminary correspondence shows
that the proclamation is based upon svÂ£
pestions which the Government of Natal/
forwarded to Colonial Secretary Cham
berlain July 24, and that the date Septem
ber 15 was recommended by Lord Milner.
"All commandants, field cornets- and
leaders of armed bands, being burghers of
the late republics and still engaged in re
sisting his Majesty's forces, whether in
Orange Colony, the Transvaal or other
portion of his Majesty's South African
Â«lominions, and all members of the late
jroverr.ments of the Orange Free State
and Transvaal shall, unless they surren

banished from South Africa. The cost of
maintenance of the families of all burgh

by September IS shall be recoverable from
such burghers and shall be a charge upon

Special Dispatch to The Call.^
After the- sales of 24,000,000 pounds of
prunes a short time ago the California
Cured Fruit Association withdrew all fruit
from the market, and for some ten. days
not a pound could be purchased. The
lock was broken this afternoon, for a time
at least, when the association entered the
market with prunes at the basis price of
3V4 cents. The association reserves the
right to advance the price or withdraw
fruit entirely and without notice. The
relations of the association with the
Packers' Company are strained, and this
may result in it entering the market and
selling directly to the trade and ignoring
the packers entirely.
Manager Hersey of the Packers' Com
pany refuses to discuss the matter. He
said the Packers' Company has desired
and urged for some time past \that the
contract relations between it an<4' the as
sociation be rescinded; and that*, he is
anxiously waiting- for the association's
terms. v . ; :. . . - .
SAN : JOSE, Aug. 9.â The differences be
tween the Cured Fruit Association and
the Packers' Company have reached such
a condition that the prune crop now on
hand will be tied upland the growers will
suffer. For the past few days there have
been no sales of fruit, although President
Woods of the . Growers' Association de
clares the demand is such there would be
no difficulty. in selling: a large quantity of
last year's prunes.' There Is but-little
chance of the row being adjusted before
the new crop comes on.
In a statement issued to-day President
Woods refers to the much-talked-of con
tract with the Packers'.' Company, made
June 30, 1900, under the terms, of which
the packers agreed to purchase the entire
crop of prunes controlled by the associa
tion. Payments were to be made in spot
cash before shipment. There was to be- a
daily- settlement between the two organi
zations of their business transactions.
The terms of the contract have not been
lived up to, and President -Wood says that
the Packers' Company is the violator of
the agreement. . - Â¦ Â¦ . . -

Lewis Morrison is slowly recovering
from the effects of his encounter with
highwaymen Thursday night. The veteran
actor sustained serious Injury and may
not be able to open his "Faust" season in
Buffalo September 2, as planned.
It was Morrison's intention to have left
yesterday for New York to attend pre
liminary rehearsals, and on Thursday aft
ernoon he drew 5400 from the bank for
traveling expenses. This money he had on
his person when attacked.
While he has no recollection of any
thing that occurred from the time he
reached the corner of "Van Ness avenue
arid Ellis street, just a stone's throw from
his residence, until "he found himself in
his wife's ; dressing room at the Alcazar
Theater, he has a faint recollection " of
crying for help and supposes the noise
frightened away his assailants.
Mr. Morrison's nose is broken, his up
per lip laid open some three inches and
one of 'his legs is badly sprained. His
hips, knees and shins are badly bruised
ami barked, and. he still suffers intense
pain in the region of the back of the neck
where the sandbag landed. He is denied

The pugilistic pot is beginning to boil
again. During this month a number of
contests, professional and amateur, will
be' brought off in this city. The National
Athletic Club has matched George Gard
ner and "Kid" Carter to battle twenty
rounds on August 30. At a previous meet
ing Gardner was given a decision over
Carter after twenty rounds of hard fight-
Ing. Both men have improved 100 per
cent since their first meeting, and the out
come of the coming fight is doubtful. Car
ter's splendid showing against clever Jack
Root in this city a few months ago has
made him very popular with local ring
goers. Gardner did not have much oppor
tunity to show the devotees of the game
what he could do on his recent appear
ance here, but he- gave them an inkling
of his caliber by outfighting Jack Moffatt
during their short bout.
â¢ "Kid" - McFadden and Willie Snailham
will furnish the preliminary contest. They
will enter the ring weighing 115 pounds.
This will be Snailham's second profes
sional .fight, and his friends are anxious
to see what he can-do against McFadden.
The latter has deposited a forfeit to be
within the stipulated weight.
An effort is being made to bring Frankie
Neil and Eddie Hanlon together again.
Both lads are amateurs, but have shown
a disposition to enter the professional
ranks. Hanlon secured a well-earned de
cision over Noil when they fought before
the Bay City Athletic Club last month.
Neil is anxious for a return match.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
hold its monthly athletic exhibition next
Friday evening. The- following card has
been aranged: Rob Johnson vs. Mike

Among those present were Rev. i Philip

The committee had to do some figuring
to arrive at the victors Â¦. and. sometimes
were delayed by reason of the fact that
some gallant player passed his card to
a fair one so that she- might have- a
chance to gain one of the I handsome
prizes awarded. In deciding on -winners
the committee counted the greatest,num
ber of points made instead of games won.
The winners of a. game would- move up
one table and- play the losers and in, this
way the partners were constantly chang
ing and the excitement was kept on the
increase. At the close of the successful
card party the tables and ' chairs were
cleared away and for more than, an hour
dancing was enjoyed. Â¦ Â¦ .. Â» ' . Â¦ . .-

The hall presented a striking appear
ance during the pnogress of the interest
ing games. Seated at sixty-three small
tables placed in ,rows of nine were 252
players. The buzz of conversation could
be heard above the music .discoursed by
an orchestra. There were no disputes and
the committee, armed with punches,
passed from table to table and credited
the players with the number of points
they were entitled' to. "Â¦
Prizes were awarded to the following
ladies and. gentlemen:
Euchre: Ladiesâ First, Miss A. O'Reilly; sec
ond. Miss Margaret Keegan. Gentlemenâ First,'

One of the most interesting entertain
ments held in this city in many months
was a progressive whist and euchre party
given last night in Golden Gate Hall by
Cathedral Council No. .59, Young Men's
Institute. The affair was highly success
ful and netted the organization more
than $150, which will be devoted to pre
paring a handsome booth for the Cathe
dral bazaar, which is to be held the latter
part of next month. ;
The "doom of the farmer" Â¦ was the
theme of discussion at the afternoon ses
sion. Mr. Sproule claimed that if oil rates
.were reduced so much oil would be forcea.
into the market as to reduce the price
of coal and make it unprofitable for ves
sels carrying coal to come here and expect
a return cargo of wheat. : Quoting â¢ from
the report of the secretary of the Produce
Exchange,. he said that 387,136 short tons
of wheat were exported in 1901, and 70 per
cent of this amount was carried away in
foreign ships which had come here laden
with coa}. . . Â¦ -, -, . . -- . Â¦ ", ..-:,.'.
Questions as to the factors that deter
mine a freight rate were hurled at Sproule
by Attorney Short. Whether "value" en
tered into the consideration of ! the freight
rate making took up the greater, portion
of the session, and a long, dissertation by
Sproule .on : this subject made jit I neces
sary to take an adjournment- until this
morning. The arguments will not be
heard until next week.'
Ah the oil moved from all the oil dis
stricts of the State for the year 1901
amounted to 250,983 tons. Â¦ Of- this amount
92,889 tons was turned over to the Santa
Fe, leaving 159,094 to be hauled by thsj
Southern Pacific Company. The" average
was fourteen carloads a day. The com-'
bined movements of oil amounted- to' 6324
carloads, averaging seventeen, a day.
From the sidings, the' Southern Pacific
Company hauled 126,000 -tons, equivalent
to 5040 cars, 420 cars per month - or four
teen, carloads a day. â¢ On '. each . car - a
switching charge of $5 was made. Â¦ â¢
It developed that local merchants who
desired a carload of freight . moved to a
private warehouse in .the city, a distance
perhaps of only "two blocks, were- com
pelled to pay -a switching charge of. $2 50
a car,- and if loaded at the same ware
house a similar charge was made f when
it ; was removed again' to the mairiMlne."
Mr. Sproule. claimed that ;; these charges
were made by. all roads. Â¦ .. .Â¦ ,.',:. â¢' ...,-'
How It Affects the. Farmer.^ Â¦â¢'
The matter- was allowed to drop, Â¦ and
attention was turned ' to a consideration
of rates charged in Eastern States with
a view, of comparing them with Califor
nia- rates. Lima,' Ohio, an important cen
ter in the oil fields of the East, was taken
as a basis and rates from there to Chi
cago, Moline, 111.; â¢ Davenport and Des
Moines, Iowa; St. Paul, Minneapolis 'and
Kansas City, all known as short/line- dis
tances, were quoted to prove that -in- no
instance was the rate less than 1 cent per
ton per mile. In all cases, Mr. ; Sproule
claimed, there was competition in these
rates by one. or two lines. OH" rates" in'
Texas and Pennsylvania were quoted for
a similar comparison. " ./ ....
Cites Eastern ; Rates.
"You car. have them if you \ want, to
stand the expense," said Mr. Herring "and
we will place every facility in your hands
for getting rthe information."
"That would take a large force of clerks
several weeks," responded Sproule. "It
would take eight or ten men two weeks
at least to cull out this information.".:, ,' *
"I think' the commission should ''be' in
possession of these figures," said Short.-
William Sproule, freight traffic manager
of the Pacifie division of the Southern
Pacific Company, was the only witness
called before the Railroad Commissioners
yesterday in the oil rate investigation.
Mr. Sproule's testimony comprised a mass
of figures, representing the earnings of
the different sections . of the" road. As
they were being read by Mr. Sproule, At
torney Short requested that they be so
segragated that- he might be enabled- to
get at the particular ones representing
the earnings of the lines from, the oil
fields to San Francisco. Â¦'Â¦'Â¦.' .' â¢ S

Dimmick was seen last Thursday even
ing in the Union League Club somewhat
under the influence of liquor. He re
marked jocosely to Â¦ Assistant United
States Attorney B. L. McKinley that the
attorney might be prosecuting him soon
in the Federal courts. He said further
that he was surprised that he had not
been arrested for the robbery of the Selby
Smelting Works also. i
Court Commissioner Heacock issued the
v-arrant for the arrest of Dimmick and
Chie! Hazen started out about 4 p. m. to
search for the accused.
The complaints charge that Dimmick
while employed in the Mint and entrusted
with the sums named feloniously and
fraudulently embezzled the same and con
verted them to his own use. The story is
not told in the complaint, but is to the ef-
IVci that Dimmick used to draw from
Cashier W. K. Cole the sums named in the
complaint for the ostensible purpose of
paying the Selby Lead and Smelting
"Works for lead pipe furnished the Mint.
Instead of paying the Selby people it is
alleged by the Secret Service people that
Dimmick kept the money for three months
or thereabouts, replacing the sums when
n.<aking up his accounts with the Gov
ernment each quarter. The Mint also
furnished the smelting works with blue
stone and took in exchange lead pipe, the
value of which Dimmick is accused of
having collected from Cashier Cole and
appropriated.
United States Attorney Woodworth said
yesterday that all ttte small sums named
had been replaced by Dimmick from time
to time after using the monev, but that
that fact did not exonerate him from the
charges of embezzlement-
