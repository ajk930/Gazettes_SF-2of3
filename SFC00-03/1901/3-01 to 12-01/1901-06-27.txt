Mrs. Gwin was-Muy. Elizabeth Hamp

Bell. She was born In Russell ville, Logan
County. Kentucky,' June 24, 1816, and was
married to William G. Logan of Glasgow,
Ky., September' 17,^ 1 .S20. ; Her 'father, kept
the tavern at Mammoth Cave,- Kentucky,
and was famous throughout .the State.. It
is Kentucky tradition that his -daughter,
Mary Elizabeth Hampton Bell, was cele
brated^ for personal beauty. and. graces. of
character. It is not surprising, therefore;
that William G. Logan, a well-known sur
veyor of Glasgow, fell in love with' the at
tractive young lady. Youthful . marriages
were then applauded in Kentucky, Vir
ginia and Tennessee; hence it was not un
common for a girl to become a bride at
15. Surveyor Logan's sweetheart was only
two months past It when the wedding
took place.. The young couple went West
and South to grow-up with the country.
They settled in Texas, where Logan sur
veyed immense. tracts of land and became
the owner Â¦ of a Â¦ lordly, number of ; acres.
Among their.' many friends in ,the/Lone:

one of the most. devoted. . If .Mrs.- Logan

, Mrs. Gwin had a most remarkable "ca
reer. Doubtless the happiest days of- her
life were passed in California, with her
children at her side and the doctor dwell

and tact In the art of entertaining. As'a
manager she was unequaled. being able
to accomplish with a limited wealth what
others could uot achieve with boundless
treasure. She was truly a noble and gift

and . gratitude of her companions. Â¦
MRS. MART E. GWIN, widow of
the late United States Sen
ator -William M. Gwin, died
yesterday morning at 11
o'clock at her home, corner of
Sacramento and Hyde streets.
Â£he had .been ill for eight months past of
the aliments attendant upon extreme old
ajre. thouph she was most remarkably
free from organic troubles. Her death
was expected almost daily during the last
month, and only her exceptional vi
tality enabled her to 'withstand the rav
ages of Illness so long.
Early yesterday morning It became evi
dent that the aged lady, who was once
among the most famous leaders of society
at the national capital and whose wish
was a power to sway the affairs of state,
bad but a few hours more at most to sur
vive. Her son and daughters were sum
moned to her bedside, and at 11 o'clock
ehe breathed her last, bo calmly and
peacefully that those who stood over her
scarcely knew when the ~?*Ht winged its
flight.
Mrs. Gwin had reached the advanced
age of 8$ years and 22 days. Until eight
months ago she enjoyed excellent health
and retained the vigor of mind, to which,
as well as to her beauty and charm of
manner, was due her Influence over public
men of the days preceding the Civil War,
and even during her prolonged Illness her
mind remained bright and her interest in
her household affairs active.
. For many years the widow of Califor
nia's first United States Senator has lived
In comparative retirement and seclusion
In Ban Francisco, and her own generation
having almost entirely passed away few
knew in detail the story of the eventful
life ' of the charming and venerable old
lady nor recalled that her Influence had
once been strong In national politics, a
President being proud to respect her
wishes and grant her requests even in
lmportaÂ«t matters of national policy. San
Franciscans came to think of her mainly
as a charming old lady with great culture
and dignity and Queenly bearing, and her
triumphs of ante-bellum days and her ad
ventures during war times were seldom
recalled except among intimate friends, of
the family.
The news of her death will be received
with Borrow by thousands of people who
knew and admired and loved Mrs. Gwin.
Among the old guard of public men there
are eome still surviving who knew her in
the halcyon days of her power, and a few
women still survive who were her asso
ciates In the social life at Washington,
and these white-haired men and women
of a bygone day will learn with keen sor
row of her death.
The ; funeral terviceo will be held .to
morrow at 2 p. m. from her late residence,
1*90 Sacramento street, at the corner of
Hyde. The Rev,- R. C.Foute, rector, of
Grace - Episcopal Church, will officiate.

SAN JOSE, June 26.â The biggest class
In the history of the San Jose State Nor
mal School was graduated from that In
stitution this morning. Eighty-nine young
teachers were given diplomas, of which
number only four were men.
The assembly hall was crowded with
friends and relatives of the graduates and
members of the alumni, who have been In
annual session here during the past two
days. An orchestral selection opened the
exercises. The Rev. C. H. Mockrldge
asked an invocation. A selection was ren
dered by the Normal quartet.
The commencement address was deliv
ered by Professor John Dewey, head of
the Apartment of pedagogy in the Chi
cago University. He was introduced by
President Morris E. Dailey. The subject
of his address was "Margins." He said
in part:
Wherever we take life, the came fact con-
fronts us. It is all a matter of degreesâ a mat
ter of the scale. One man feels poverty plnch
ir.z him because he cannot acquire a railroad
Â«j stern; with another the pressing issue may be
how many times in the year he can afford to
Â«at meat. It is exactly the . same eort of a
question to each â a question of the margin or
ratio of exoense and Income. . -
Whether a man have one talent or. ten, his
problem, his training, are the same and the
measure of his success and failure is the same.
Hold If you will three Images for a moment In
your mind: the man cowering hopelessly aloft;
the one coing the weary round, of the treadmill,
end the third walking: assured, interested and
competent In paths of beauty and delight which
he never trod before. Contrast the three and
}-ou have the principle of margins which runs
through all of life. One has none; another too
much; while the third who 'has the right rela
tion between the new and the old, between
the habitual and unexplored, between power
end problem, lives & life effective In execution
end saturated in interest.
We are beginning to recognize that it is
growth, that it Is the process Itself that counts.
Every step has Its own problems. Its own de
mand for the expenditure of energy. Its own
stimulus to growth, its richness of meaning,
and its Â«wn revelation of mw possibility. To
be Impatient with this growth, to hurriedly slur
It over in eagerness for . the nnal fruit, is a
defeat of our own aim. Growth cornea only
through growing. Fruit is simply the evidence
of a stage of life â net an end all and to be all.
The truth Is not without its lesson for. the
social reformer. Abraham Lincoln had to
reckon In his time with quite as much opposi
tion from the would-be Idealists as from the
obstructionists. The immediate abolitionist,
anxious to do away with wrong and become
perfectly right at a single blow, had no pa
tience with the slow and tortuous steps of his
tory. To-day "in politics. In the world of capi
tal and labor, and in the world of education,
we are confronted everywhere with the man
who will do nothing because he regards all as
essentially impracticable and unattainable, and
also with the man who would wipe out the
present, etart afresh, an*, by some miracle
usher in the ideal, the mllehnlum. Both types
suffer from a common errur. Both destroy con
tinuity and deny the principle of margins. One
will have the good all at once; the other will
do nothing because he sees that he cannot have
it all at once. .
Our whole conception of Ideals and successes
In realizing them needs restatement. Contem
plation of the goal as a poal wastes time, di
verts attention and prevents that prompt and
effective action which alone can finally bring
a man to his goal. The ship does not sail to
ti= starâ it sails by It; It uses the star to get
direction. â¢

Great Enthusiasm of the Dutch, for
the Former Transvaal
% President.
ROTTERDAM, June 26.â Paul Kruger,
President of the late South African Re
public, was welcomed at the railroad sta
tion on his arrival here to-day by
burgomaster, deputations from numerous
societies and many ladies. Two bands of
music, on a platform, played the national
Transvaal anthem and hundreds of work
men's societies were drawn up, along 1 the
streets leading from, the station to the
town hall, to which Kruger was driven,
escorted by a guard of former Transvaal
officers. An official reception followed.
Great enthusiasm was manifested every
where.
In a speech of welcome at the town hall
the burgomaster 3poke of the similarity
between the Transvaal and Dutch strug
gles for liberty, and said Rotterdam,
wished, through Kruger, to pay her
homage to the little Boer nation which
had shown Such faith and confidence in
its own strength.
Kruger, in a brief reply, deplored the
fact thÂ«jt his country was cut off from
supplies and ammunition, whereas the
Dutch had their own supplies during their
struggles. He was fully convinced the
Lord would deliver his country in Hla
own good time.
There was a. grand serenade and torch
light procession to-night in honor of Mr.
Kruger, who witnessed the proceedings
from the balcony of his hotel. There was
Immense enthusiasm among the people.
After the demonstrations many persona
bearing illuminated transparencies In
scribed "Silence, the President Sleeps,"
paraded the streets to disperse the crowd.

Italy's position is consequently Identical
with that of Russia. An official of tho
Government, who is not In. accord with
Gage's policy, said to-day that the nations
of Kurope could well reply to the action
of this Government by Imposing retalia
tory duties on "probable cause."
But. whether In favor of or opposed to
Gage's action, all officials agree that the
agitation which has occurred will be bene
ficial in showing the country the real sen
timent of Europe and the* effect on Con
gress will probably be to cause a ratifica
tion of pending reciprocity treaties. Im
mediately upon their ratification, other
treaties, one with Russia and another with,
ItaJy. will be submitted to the Senato for
Its approval.

its furniture and arranged for the big re
ception which followed the ceremony.
There were flowers all over, but only the
largo old fireplace with its quaint wooden
settees on either side received the especial
attention of the decorators. The high
mantel shelf was hid with a wealth of
pink geraniums and clinging ferns, in the
midst of which glimmered electric lights.
American Beauty roses were the only
other flowers used in the room.
Tho guests bidden to the wedding be
gan to arrive early. . Many of the Bur
-llngamites came on foot, the. gentlemen
walking briskly along the splendid roads
while drawing on their white gloves and
the ladies, with skirts held daintily well
above the ground, tripping lightly at their
sides. None of \ the Burlingame ladles
wore any wraps.
Wedded Under the Great Oak.
It was a few minutes after 11 when the
special with Its load of Invited guests from
the city pulled into the Burlingame sta
tion. Carriages, buses and traps of all
sorts were in attendance to receive- the
guests, who were driven rapidly through
the eucalyptus-lined paths to the Scott
residence. All the guests were comfort
ably installed at the home before the
strains of the bridal march announced
that the all-important event was about to
take place.
The bridal party came down the pretty
winding stair that leads from the upper
story of the Scott home to the spacious
living-room, where', through an aisle
outlined by white satin ribbons, they
led the way to tho floral nook beneath the
oak. where Archbishop Rlordan and Fa
ther CXKeef e awaited â¢ their coming. , The
well-dressed and happy crowd gathered
around them and listened In silence to the
Impressive ceremony. As the conclud
ing: words were spoken the orchestra
burst into they Joyous strains of Men
delssohn's wedding march, and, the newly
wedded couple leading the way, the march
was made back to the living-room, wherÂ«
Mr. and Mrs. Martin received the coh^
gratulations of their relatives and'frlends.
Gorgfeous Attire of the. Bride.

smiling down, upon them, Col
onel Walter S. Martin and
Miss Mary Scott repeated aft
er ' Archbishop Rlordan. the
solemn, binding words that made them
husband and wife.
Yesterday was an Ideal day for a wed
ding. Nature put on her rosiest smile to
do fconor to the happy young couple. The
wind which for the past few days has
moaned and whistled through the Bur
lingame woods was in abeyance. Not a
leaf stirred and only the Joyous carol of
feathered songsters broke the heavy
afternoon stillness. It was as if Fortune,
which has always reserved her choicest
gifts for the happy pair, had ordained
that their wedding day should be in every
respect a perfect one. At sunrise the
members of the Scott household began to
stir. The decorators got to work. The
maids, with the aid of brooms and dust
ers, polished things up until their very
images were reflected in the Inlaid floors,
the brass knobs, the plateglass windows
and great knocker.

Long before tbe auspicious day was
eight hours old, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T.

to every one, especially assisting the dec
orators with her kindly advice born of
her rare artistic taste and discrimination.
She Invited all of the many people who
were putting the last needful touches to
the canopy, the raised platform and the
garlands of rare blossoms, to enter and
Inspect the many handsome presents that
had been sent to "Miss Mary." Workmen
in overalls and blouses crowded into the
room that was fljled with the glittering
display and followed the gracious lady of
the house abput as she explained that
"that painting is a Keith. That one from
the brush of an English master. That
dish"â a beautiful silver one embossed In

ley."
Gorgeous pieces of silver, tokens from.
Secretary and Mrs. Wilson, Secretary and
Mrs. Hay, Secretary and Miss Hitchcock
and Postmaster General* Smith, were
pointed out and duly admired.
So elaborate were the floral settings for
the wedding that almost up. to the last
minute the decorators were* kept busy.
The arrangements were the triumph of
the art that conceals art. A large plat

After young Scott delivered himself of
this brilliant aphorism Scott pere ap
peared on the threshold ready to receive
the guests. He lit his cigar, dropped his
match .on, his newly ; painted front steps

up the burnt match and brushed the ashes

"I don't like reporters," Henry T. kept
muttering as he puffed away at his cigar.
However, when tho auspicious hour ar
rived Scott sentiments underwent a trans
formation scene.
Henry T. devoted his early morning to

came from San Francisco to gather ma

BOTH CREWS EXPECT
VICTORY FROM THE RACE
Harvard and Yale Eights Confident
on the Eve of
Battle.
NEW-LONDON, Conn., June 26.â It Is
the night before the big dual race and
large numbers of visitors are in town.
On the streets and in the hotels the cus-
tomary excitement prevails. * - â¢..-.
At the quarters of Yale and Harvard
each crew retired as if it were -to-mor
row night and its own boat had already
crossed the finish line the winner. But it
is not overconfidence. . It is only the
knowledge of each man that he and his
comrades are going into the struggle as
fit physically as weeks of careful training
can make him, that he is able to do his
best for four, miles and that his own best
Is better than the other man's. The Har
vard 'varsity and freshmen eights were
on the river only about fifteen minutes
early this evening, and their work con
sisted of a few racing starts, in which the
'varsity averaged a half length gain 1 on
the youngsters in six lengths rowed.
After the practice the men dined and re
tired early. Â¦; " , â¢
Mr. Storrow said tq-nlght that he Saw
no reason. to change" his statement- of a
week ago as to the rowing ability of the
men in his-care. 1^ ThW statement was, Jt
will be remembered, not particularly en*
couraging as to the result from a Har
vard standpoint, but it has been received
cum grano salis, as with all such an r
no.uncements. . Â¦ \
The Yale 'varsity and freshmen eights
and the 'varsity four took but light work
for their last night before the race, the
'varsity and freshmen going two racing
starts together and the four a few
stretches. ' . . Â¦'.'Â¦'-
Those strenuous ball players from Sac
ramento who try to scare umpires and to
intimidate opposing teams will exhibit at
Recreation Park this week. They are
not so gay as they were when they left
home, for then they were, neck and neck
with the 'San Frandscos* and promised
to take the lead. Los Angeles gave them
a fearful drubbing last week, and now
they are in third place. But they are
Etill close on the heels of the leaders, and
as they are to meet the Frisco6 this week
something interesting may be expected.
This is the line-up for to-day:

Manager Harris is looking for two or
three good players to strengthen his in
field and outer garden. An advertisement
will appear, this week in the Sporting
Life offering inducements to a few stars
to scintillate in this section.
Â¦ The locals played National League ball
during the last series. The players bunt
ed, sacrificed and stole bases like cham
pions, and if the good work is continued {
they are in no danger of being- displaced
by any of their rivals. !
Moskiman's injury was slight, and he \
â¢will in all probability show the Angels a ;
new assortment of* curves. The Doctor
is extremely popular with the multitude,
as he plays clean ball.
Schwartz and Hilderbrand made a dou
ble steal in the last game of the series.
This was something that has not been
worked in many moons. It took Petey
Lehman's breath away and he fumbled
the ball.
Householder is keeping up his stick I
work. In one of the games last week he
made three hits, one three-bagger, a two
bagger and a single.
Â¦ Lncle's men laid themselves ODen to
severe criticism by going to Golden Gate i
Sunday morning with only nine men. Had i
Evans or Iburg been on the scene the to- !
cals would not have defaulted, iburg !
claims that he was sick and* could not at- !
tend the game. His excuse was accepted i
and he was fined accordingly. Evans es- '
caped punishment as he was not expected Â¦
to be on the scene, having pitched the
previous afternoon.
Los Angeles -won three out of four and '
the Dutch four out of., flve in the last â¢
Â¦ series. j
Schwartz runs out to his position and
to the plate like a National Leaguer. It
would be appreciated if all the teams fol
lowed his example. The games are de
layed by slow footwork. Â«
Pete Lohman tried to take a ball off the
bat and throw it to second, but Nordyke
foiled him by rapping his knuckles. Petey
danced a merry jig until the pain abated.
ICordyke's admonishment, however, was
unintentional. !
"Ypungey" Johnson brought a white
dog on the field on Sunday to bring good
luck, but the purp proved a Jonah. Oak
land rooters suggested to the comedian
that he try a horseshoe.
Ewing's cripples will hie themselves to
the citrus belt this week for a try with
the Angels. The Legislators and the Ger
mans will debate at Recreation Park.
Evans did not complain when. Harris
took him out of the box last Sunday. He
knew It was baseball. Evans' wing is a
good one. but he tires himself out early
in the game by putting the ball over With
unchecked and ungauged .force.
Lohman works a pitcher to perfection
when at the bat. "Old dead-eye" fouls
off every good, one and then plucks a ripe
one for a couple of sacks.
Deveraux hurt himself sliding home in
the eighth inning at Los Angeles-Sunday.
Managers should discipline a player
whenever he exhibits rowdv tactics at a
game. During the past two series a num
ber of players have acted ungentlemanly
and the spectators do not like it. A few
fines would correct this abuse.
The Angels are called the Looloos by
the fans in the south.
Henry Beitz. the famous second base
man, is playing great ball for the orange
growers.
A number of games In Los Angeles
were marred by unnecessary kicking in
dulged in by both teams. Graves started
out well in his first game, keeping the
players well in check but gradually they
got beyond his control. If Umpire Graves
would adopt Tyler's scheme of holding up
flve fingers every time "sass" is given
aim this bickering- would stop
! When Captain Pabst examined Dun
leavy's bat in Sunday's game he did so to
see If it had a flat surface. A bat of this
kind Is forbidden by the rules, and it lies
â¢with the umpire whether it should or
should not be used. Graves ordered the
pne used by Bowman out of the game
last week.

"CHAMP" WHITNEY
Finals for Kahn Cup
Furnish a General
v Surprise; ; ,
Tennis Tournament Is Ended
and the Prize Goes to
-v Smith. Â¦Â¦Â¦..Â¦Â¦; .-.'Â¦.
"A large crowd was on hand at the Cali
fornia courts yesterday to see - the final
match. for the Kahn cup' between Cham
pion George ' Whitney and Grant \ Smith.
After three hard -fought sets replete with
brilliant plays Smith emerged a winner.
As usual Whitney was the favorite,: and
the fact that he was beaten three straight
sets, and the last one a love' set, came
as a great surprise to everybody present.
Smith received a handicap of 7-6 of fif
teen and won 6-2, 12-10, 6-0. â¢
At the very outset the. champion ap
peared to be nervous,; and the handicap
seemed to worry him. very much: -The
first set fell to Smith rather easily.- but
the second set was a battle royal. Smith
started in the lead, but Whitney soon ran
the score up to 5-3 in his favor and looked
to have the set won. . Smith was very
much distressed at this stage of the game,
but seemed to get his second wind, and
from then on Whitney got the vantage
game but once. In this set, which was
the deciding one, Whitney was very nerv
ous and ' netted many easy balls, while
Smith appeared to be -very cool and his
volleying and bobbing were excellent. The
set finally fell to Smith, 12-10. .
; In the last set Whitney changed his
game and tried driving and playing the
balls hard, but to- no avail. Smith was
confident, while Whitney seemed to have
lost heart and quit. The final set fell to
Smith, 6-0. "
During the entire match both players
ran in on their service, and throughout it
was a fight for the net. Smith played the
best game he has ever put up, while the
champion, being worried by the handicap,
did not play in form. Whitney, lost
many points through making double
faults. Smith's victory was a well-earn
ed one, as he defeated two of the best
men in the second class on even terms,
the best man in the third class, allowing
him odds of 7-6 of fifteen, and the best
man |n the first class, who allowed him
the same handicap. r â¢
By virtue of this victory Smith becomes
the owner of the handsome silver cup do
nated by Percy D. Kahn.

HABBOE COMMISSIQNEBS MEET.
3>t Contracts for Repairing Half a
Dozen of the Wharves.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
general meeting yesterday and then went
Into executive session on ways and means.
The City Street Improvement Company
offered to pave Lombard street, between
Sansome and Battery, with basalt blocks
for 19 cents per square foot. The matter
was left in the hands of the president and
secretary of the board.
The Union Lumber Company's request
to have Channel 6treet from Sixth street
to the bay dredged was taken under con
sideration.
The proposed repairs to Union-street
wharf are estimated to cost $10,884. The
chief engineer Â¦was Instructed to have
plans and specifications for the work pre
pared.
The contract for repairing Broadway
wharves was let to the Hyde Construction
Company for $2360. and the contract for
repairing Mission, Howard, Harrison,
Epear and Main street wharves was let to
the same concern for $2369.
Searching for Wreck of Hio.
Another "medium" is seeking the re
mains of the lost Rio de Janeiro by aid of
the "spirits." Yesterday In company
with Miss Reed of Tiburon she went out
in a launch and with the aid of a board
and two candles tried to locate the
wreck. It was bo rough, however, that
both the women got seasick and had to
put back to land. People guided by spir
its and others who think a divining rod
can do the trick have been a great source
of profit to divers and launch boatmen of
late. They all assert they have found the
wreck, but, 6trange to say, each one has
located It in a different place.
Loading' for Melbourne.
The old Yosemite has changed hands
and her new owners have altered her rig.
She was built thirty-three years ago and
In her time was one of the smartest ships
afloat. She came to this coast nearly a
generation ago and did yeoman's service
in the coal trade. Then she was sold to
the White Star Transportation Company
of Seattle, who ran her in the Skaguay
trade. When they tried to put her Into
the coastwise trade again the United
States inspectors of hulls and boilers ob
jected. The vessel was then sold to San
Francisco parties, who brou^it her here
end turned her into a bark. She is now
loading lumber In Oakland Creek for Mel
bourne, Australia; and will probably bring
a cargo of coal back to Honolulu or San
Francisco.

AMONG primitive men might made right and
disputes were settled by brute force, a sys
tem under which the weak stood no chance
against the strong. This method of settling indi
vidual issues descended to historic times and found its
best expression in the judicial combat of the middle
ages, and the code duello of a later period. In these
successive phases of the method of settling personal
differences we may trr.ee the ris*e of jurisprudence, a
system which equalizes the weak and the strong, issues
between them being decided upon their merits and
not by the accident of physical inequality between
the suitors. >
In the beginning trial by combat was a lawless, un
regulated struggle, hand to hand. Later it was sub
jected to regulations looking to the preservation of,
fair play. These regulations were carried with added
stringency into the code duello, and finally the whole
institution of ordeal and combat was superseded by
the judicial system, providing an impartial tribunal
for weak and strong alike. Briefly, this was a change
from a system under which the weak had no rights,
for he who could not defend his rights could not
have any, to one of adjudication according to the
principles of justice and equality. All this has come
gradually, with the slow rise of civilization, and has
been partly a cause and partly an effect of that civili
zation of which it is the most potent and prominent
institution. This age is proud of its superiority
over the past in this respect. Its courts of justice
apply the rules of law, and before them rich and poor,
weak and strong, stand upon a level.
While this is so with the individual and every man
can have his day in court, the nations are farther
back than the dark ages in their methods of settling
differences. They still rely on the wager of battle,
and burden their people with the support of standing
armies to be used in war. The weak and the strong
nations and peoples hold the same relation to each
other that the weak and strong individuals did in the
primitive past
It is true that there are agreements as to what
shall be fair acts of war, but the strong do not ob
serve them. We violated them when we used Hono
lulu as a military station in the Spanish war, though
Hawaii was an independent republic and, like us,
was bound by neutral obligations. England seized
many cargoes of flour in transit to the. Boers via the
neutral port of Lorenzo Marquez, but has bought
and shipped from our ports millions of dollars'
worth of flour, haj% horses and. mules for the use of
her army operating against the Boers. The rules of
war arc to restrain the weak. The strong violate them
at will. So it lias come to pass that the weak nations
exist by sufferance or because of the mutual jealousies
of the strong.
_ A great step "forward will have been taken when the
weak nations are admitted to \ court of arbitration.
Arbitration between nations is the analogue of judi
cial trial between individuals. It will have to pass
through the same stages of evolution. The- Hague
conference refused to admit the weak powers, and in
its scheme of arbitration also excluded them. But it
is a great step forward for the great powers which are
nearly equal to agree to arbitrate disputes between
themselves. - . â¢**
The spectacle of a peaceful and honorable solution
of a dispute between two great nations, while both
with gun in hand are pursuing and oppressing the
weak, will soon impress the conscience of the world
and all will be admitted, upon terms of perfect
equality, to the court of arbitration.
The United States can "well afford 'to be the first in
asking that- the small and weak nations shalPhave
their day in court. It is probable that before the Chi
nese trouble is adjusted there will be an opportunity
to make this appeal in behalf of that sorely wronged
pepple, and . it is probable that we would have the
support of Russia, and Great Britain, a concert of
powers strong, enough to achieve this great. glory of
the modern world. .

DREDGE MINING.
THE CALL has reproduced various opinions as
to the utility of the profitable dredge mining
in the Feather River bottoms, considered in
the light of its local benefit. . .
The present generation may not be vitally inter
ested in the final effect of this novel mining. It is
carried on on fine bottom lands, that are covered with
vineyards and orchards, for which the owners were
paid high prices. The soil is 1 * mixed with bowlders
and coarse and fine gravel, which was carried there
by the waters of the river and came finally to be filled
in with soil. .The dredging process washes the soil
out and takes from it the gold. But the soil does not
run away. It does not go into the river, but is car
ried back among the stones.- The dredged area is sub
ject to overflow, and '.by that process the soil came
to be among and over the rocks. It is probable that
by the time the iast acre of Feather River placer is
being dredged out the first one that was washed will
have been long in orchard again and bearing fruit.
.Some of the mining companies which are at work
there have ground enough to keep them going sev
enty-five and a hundred years. The value \>i the
business is its permanency^ The fine gold begins at
the grass roots and goes on down thirty feet or more
to bedrock. The yield does not vary much ' over the
whole district. It is about seventy-five cents a cubic
"yard, so that there is no speculation nor gambling in
that form of mining, and there seems but little jus
tification for any gloomy foreboding of the future of
Oroville as the result of its activity. The new houses
it has Vbuilt will require paint many times before the
last yard of pay dirt has been washed.*

PERSONAL MENTION.
The dullest season of the year in the
publishing world has arrived^ yet looking
down the announcements for the summer
months the period will not be altogether
void of interest, with Hall Caine's "Eter
nal City" coming from Helnemann; John
Oliver Hobbes' "Serious Wooing" from
Messrs. Methuen; Sir Walter Besant's
historical romance. "The Lady of Lynn,"
from Messrs. Chatto & Windus, which Is
announced for publication on July 4.
Messrs. Ward, Lock & Co. also announce
one or two books for the slack season,
including "My Lady's Diamonds." by Miss
Adeline Sergeant, and "The Coward," by
Robert L. Jefferson, author of several
bocks of travel.
Then there will be Crockett's new story,
"Cinderella," which is . almost ready to
see the light in book form; a translation
of Paul Bourgefs novel. "The Di3clple,"
while '.'The Bourgeoise." by H. de Vere
Stackpoole, will follow a little later In
Messrs. Unwin's Green Cloth Library.
August Is expected to bring Emlle Zola
to London, and he will be preceded by a
new volume of .stories under the title of
"The Honor of the Army," edited, with an
introduction, .by. Ernest Vlzete'lly.
Messrs. Chatto & Windus have publish
ed most oX their books lately announced.
However, for the autumn early season
they will probably publish David Christie
Murray's "Despair's Last Journey." Two
other novels announced for the autumn
are Gilbert Parker's. "Right of Way"
(Helnemann) and J. M. Barrie's new un
named book (Hodder & Stoughton). while
Messrs. Methuen will make a feature of
a new story by Lucas Cleeve, entitled
"The History of Sir Richard Calmady."
which enjoys the distinction of being the
longest novel a publisher ever sent to the
press. It runs to over 700 pages.
After a long widowhood* passed in ex
cellent health, death Is menacing Mrs.
Matthew Arnold In one of the mcst pain

bered as the "Flu" of her husband's pub

Another item of news which will be es
pecially interesting to Americans is that
the graceful poetess and brilliant prose
writer, Mrs. Wilfrid Meynell, is shortly
going over to California to visit frfends.
She will be absent from England for at
least three 'months. â¢

facts from . the contemporary official re
ports published for the first time in r>e
metrius Boulger's "The Belgians at Wat

Dutch and Belgians in the battle, and has
agreed to eliminate the' disparaging pas

found k place in the description of the
campaign given in the English edition of

. The new edition, about to appear for
1901, will give a more restrained descrip

GOSSIP FROM
LONDON'S WORLD
OF LETTERS
THE acceptance of Mr. Carnegie's gift of ten
millions to the Scotch universities has started
the old discussion of the respective merits' of
professional and practical education. The successful
men, according to the standard of the age, are not,
as a rule, college graduates, nor trained in either of>
the three lettered professions â law, physics and
divinity. s â¢
Yet the schools which train to those professions are
thronged, and every year they graduate fresh recruits
to ranks that seem already overcrowded. Perhaps a
reason may. be found in the comparative independence
of the professional life. . In the industrial and
business lives there is an impression that independence
is not easily attainable. Not every bank : clerk
can hope to be a J. Pierpont Morgan, nor
every apprentice mechanic a Schwab. â¢ The
industrial and financial- combinations which are
the surprising feature of the age seem to
the aspiring man to offer no opportunity for ad
vancement in the lines which they occupy. The in
dependent mechanic, owner of his own shop and
tools of trade and competing on equal terms with
others like him, is a less frequent figure than a few
years ago. The small merchant is disappearing, ex
cept in country towns, where he is a distributer. of
the wares produced, not by a large number of com
petitors, but by one combination. So it, has seemed
to come to pass that tilling' the soil and practicing in
a profession the only competitive lines left which
men may follow in the hope to achieve independence
as the fruit of individual genius and thrift. ' .
Unfortunately for the health and morality of man
kind, there seems in this country a growing aversion
for country life and tilling the soil as a life occupa
tion. Those born in the country are crowding into
the professions in the city, and the city-born are
not going into the country to fill their places. The
youths who laughed derisively at the one graduate of
the ' Agricultural School- of our. State University
were themselves mostly country bred and reared, but
their vision was blurred to the nobility of that calling,
whose profits were paying for their education at the
university. A further evidence. of the llccay of the
moral spirit was . apparent in the fact that the one
graduate was a young lady. Her " embarrassment,
when. laughed at,. was observed by the members of
President McKinley's Cabinet, who were present, and
with a spirit of true manhood and greatness that will
not soon be forgotten they greeted her and the Sec
retary of Agriculture -immediately offered her lucra
tive employment hr his department, and she found
herself differing from a large majority of the graduat
ing class < in being equipped for the immediate com
mencement of 'a self-supporting career.
We are of the opinion that collegiate training may
direct the young toward many paths of independence
besides the three learned professions, and that trained
minds will "not lie fallow and useless in, the future.
The stress upon 1 the world* caused by. its increasing
human . population makes every year more necessary:
the scientific. training of men to conserve and extend
the resources upon which life depends. No industrial

THREE hundred â¢ "hello" girls In the main office of the
Chicago Telephone Company, 203 Washington street,
now trill the gladsome "Busy; please call again," be
tween sips of black coffee and mouthfuls of salad, .says
the Chicago Tribune. "With a demi-tasse at elbow and
a mind-reading attendant to keep the strawberry ice-cream
within reach, work at the switchboard has become a dream. â¢
.When the girls arrived at the office the other morning in
the full consciousness of owning figures that must be preserved
at any cost, they found verification of what they had read in
the Tribune, that President Sabln never had intended them to
walk up nine flights of stairs, to the dissipation of their phys
iques. Learning that they wejje merely requested to walk 'down
stairs, and that only in the rush hours of the day, the young
women blessed President Sabln all the way up In the elevators.
But. before they had donned the helmets that hold the tele
phone receivers, the girls were invited to view the cafe and par
lor which the company haÂ» fitted up for their especial comfort.
One-half of the seventh floor is set aside for the use and
comfort o.f the girls. Mcst, of the; apace Is occupied by the
restaurant tables, which- can' accommodate half the force at
one time. A chef and tbreo waitrosxea arÂ« In attendance, and
meats are served at any. time of. the day or. night.
Heretofore tho switchboard operators have been obliged
to. bring .their lunches with them or leave the building at the
noon hour. President Sabin, however, came from San Fran
cisco, where the telephone company has fed its employes at its
own expense i for many years. He Immediately transplanted
tho idea to Chicago soil, and intimated at the same time that
better service would be obtained from the employes as soon
as the first meal had been tasted. General Superintendent S.
J. Lamed says alreafly that President Sabln was right.
On the occasion of the formal dedication of the. cafe,
â¢ the girls were enthusiastic. They said a last good-by to
lunch boxes and cold snacks, and attacked the hot meal
with too evident satisfaction. This was the menu:
Bouillon.
, S * whit**. CeIery '
Roast Beef. Mashed Potatoes.
Cherry Pie. i co Cream.
Tea - Coffee. Milk.
A tendency developed to linger over the coffee cups and
praise President Sabln, who did not issue the edict against
their* sips, and the manager was compelled to resort to sharp
COmm .t nd }Â° JF et \ hls feralnlne cohort back Into action at the
switchboard. Then it was announced that whenever any girl
felt faint or sleepy or otherwise in need of refreshment an, at
tendant would bring coffee and sandwiches or any other
delicacy. One end of the cafe Is ntted up as a reading and
lounging. apartment for tho girls. Books and the- latest man
zincs are at hand and rocking chairs and a couch give a home
like air to the place. When a girl is tired she may leave tha
switchboard for a half hour's nap -on thÂ« sofa!
Last night the girls walked down the nine flights of stairs
and the only word spoken on the misinterpreted topic of tÂ£
hips was, ''Hip, hip hooray, and a tiger for President Sabla"
: In speaking of the move of the company in the interwts ot

It is a pretty display of human kindness to petted
animals and reveals much of a 'genuine goodness of
heart,- for it appears that t^e home is designed for the
rescue of stray dogs and cats who by some chance
have been lost upon the streets. ' - "
Another item from Paris tells Â¦ us that among
American visitors in that city this summer the fash
ionable amusement is slumming, and- it goes on to
narrate aiv incident in the evening of one particular
party in this way: "Mrs., Robert Goelet, Mrs. Og
den,'Miss May Goelet and Mrs. Armour, with several
gentlemen and two detectives, visited the sordid Rue
Mouffetard and found Jean Grave, the famous an
archist, writing in his bare garret. He promptly or
dered the party out, threatening to shoot even the de
tectives if they lingered. : Young Bradley tried to
soothe the old writer, saying loftily, 'Here, my man,
take $10 and' talk to us about your ideas and your
schemes.' 'I don't want your money!' cried Jean;'
'and don't you call me "my man." If you weren't a
fool you'd understand that your patronizing an aged
worker who has raised a family of ten children- by
manual labor and written twenty volumes to enlighten
his brethren is unbecoming in a young cub like you,
who have never given a thought to anything' serious
in .life/."' "..'. ;â¢'-Â¦ Â¦ . .-
It is hardly worth while to comment upon the
stories. The contrast between the loving care be
stowed upon pugs and cats and the idle curiosity*
shown regarding the lives of the poor carries its own
moral. The two sides of Paris are there presented.
The one side has so much of wealth and gentleness
that it weeps 1 for a lost dog and contributes liberally
to save others that. may be lost.* The other side is
so indifferent to every generous instinct that it not
only declines to help the -poor, but does not even
sympathize with them. .The odd part of it allfis that
the two "sides are made up of exactly the same people.
JKFFEHSON LEE, who lives on the St. Johns River, in
Putnam County, Fla., has the most extraordinary team
in the country. It is a team of alligators that Mr. Lee
uses to tow his boat up and down the river when he
goes to' market. - -
. Mr. Lee has to go six miles down the river to his postof
fice, and it is a hard pull against the current coming back.
He* noticed how swiftly alligators swam, and it occurred to
him that it might\be a- good idea to' turn the alligators that
abound in the St. Johns River to some account. He captured
a pair of young 'gators and raised them in his yard. He
taught -them to swim and drag a weight behind them, and
he also taught them to turn either .to the right or left' by
pulling ropes fastened to their teeth on either side.
When the alligators were big enough â¢ he 1 put a harness
that he had constructed on them and V harnessed them to J hl3
boat. They swam weir and pulled' the boat through the water
at a good speed. By pulling on thereins that passed through
the mouths of the 'gators Mr^ Lee "was able to turn his
strange team in any direction he pleased. . - ' .~-
Mr. Lee' made a point of never feeding ; his alligators until
after they returned from a trip, when he would Immediately
reward each one with a fine meal. ''i.
The alll|ators seem td be willing to perform their task of
pulling his boat, and when* he turns them out of the pen in
which they are stabled and starts them for the water they
shuffle down to the boat in the liveliest style, and after they
are hitched they plunge into the water with grunts of delight.
Mr.- Lee says his strange team his never run away nor
kicked out the dashboard of his river' craft, but that they
have one fault, for which, however, he does not blame them.
They sometimes sweep their powerful tails in a curve through
the water, . and once smashed one of his boats Into small bits
and threw Mr. Lee and a party that he was taking; boat rid
ing into the river. They would all have been drowned had
not the alligators swum back to them and permitted the
party to climb on their backs, after which the alligators
swam swiftly to the shore and all of the party were saved.'
Mr. Lee. now hitches his team twenty feet .in front of . the
boat, so that the sweep of their tails will not endanger tha
craft.
Mr. IÂ«e's success has created great interest among all his
neighbors, and now many alligators are being trained for
duty as sea horses.

y< RESIDENT.- SCHURMAN. of Cornell has in
I - some - quarters roused the ire ' and in others
;"*Â¦"." the thought of his countrymen by calling atten
tion'to'the engrossment of the American intellect in
material- invention, arid its abstention fromithe : use
of the imagination : in : artistic invention. - Dr."
Schurman has , the facts on his side, but- his critics
should not begin their work by abusing him for stat
ing facts. . Â¦
After 1 all there is nothing humiliating' in what he
calls our intellectual dependence upon Europe^ In
the present day Europe is dependent upon the intellect
of a day that has gone by. No one" has ever equaled
the inventive genius of Hor..ji; The strictly modern
world has not produced another like him, and
Shakespeare has been dead long enough for England
lo have presented his peer, but she has not. / In
science modern Europe has no Copernicus,' Bruno,
nor Galilei, no Newton, Laplace nor Lavoisier.
But in America we have applied science to eco
nomics to an extent never dreamed of by the scient
ists whose discoveries we are adapting to the* uses
of man. Franklin would have doubted had he been
told that he brought down with that spark on his kite
string the electric railroad, telegraph, telephone, cook
stove, street and house lights, and the power that
lights mines, and crushes their ore, and that moves
horseless vehicles. He established the identity of the
lightning with frictional electricity and robbed. the
Prince of the Powers of the Air of one of the most
valuable attributes with which superstition invested
him. But Franklin did not live to invent the- means
that now make his discovery of economic value.
it be admitted that in a past age and in Eu
rope invention ran to art and literature to a degree
now unknown, and with results that we -may despair
of excelling, yet in the age of these marvels no atten
tion was paid to the inventions needed to/ raise the
material condition of man. All the ancient scientists
and men .of letters wrought and wrote, while -the
masses of men were in squalor and ignorance, and
lived and died not'knowing of their work. Economic
invention, in which Dr. Schurman admits the excel
lence of America, addressed itself to making it all servo
the material interests of man. The result is that his
condition 'has so improved that the materially inef
fective writers and discoverers have now the modern
world for an audieifce. We may have no Shake
speares for five hundred years ; to come, and . no
Homers for a thousand, but we all read and appre
ciate both, where neither was read, appreciated nor
heard of by one man m a million of his own genera
tion. â¢
Who shall say that these material inventions are not
as creditable as the writing of the siege of Troy, or
"Othello," or "Faust," or the ''Principia," or the
nebular hypothesis, or the discovery of the earth's
rotundity and the origin of species, or the mural
decoration of the Sistine Chapel?
Jethro Wood invented the iron moldboard plow
and doubled the crops on every acre tilled. The spin
ning jenny, the power loom and cotton gin cheapened
clothing and made.it better, while the inventions. of
Wood, and McCormick and Johnson's application of
chemistry to the analysis of soils, were increasing and
cheapening food. Morse, Field and Marconi, Bell
and Edison, have quickened and cheapened the com
munication which makes the most distant the nearest
neighbors in point of time. All of these ameliorating
inventions have enlarged the physical comfort of the
world until it is equal to the intellectual pleasure given
by the imaginative words of the masters of letters and
art. .
Let us not decry an age that has fed, clothed and
housed man better than any knew before, and in ad
dition has so intellectually, enlightened the masses that
the countrymen of Raphael, Copernicus, Newton,
Goethe, Laplace and Shakespeare know them, though
they were unknown by their- contemporaries.

TRADE EXHIBIT
The CommerciaiMuseum
* Hears Prom Agent
' at Manila.
Costa Rica Makes an Offer
of Its Wares Now at
Buffalo.
The establishment In this city. In con
nection with the Pacific Commercial Mu
seum, of the first commercial exhibit rep
resentative of trade conditions in the
Philippine Islands, was rendered sure by
a cablegram received yesterday by - Di
rector Eugene Goodwin. This cablegram
was signed by the agent of the museum at
Manila, and it fully answered, all expec
tations. In addition to this gratifying
news' an offer was received of the exhibit
cf Costa Rica, upon condition that it be
removed from the Pan- American Exposi
tion immediately upon the close of thÂ©
big show at Buffalo to the quarters of the
Commercial Museum in this city. This of
fer will be accepted. Tho Costa Rica ex
hibit embraces a large collection, which
requires a epace" at Buffalo of 1660 square
feet.
Already the Philadelphia Commercial
Museum has requested Director Goodwin
to secure duplicate articles of trade value
Irom the Pnillpplnes, and this will be
done. Now that the Philippine collection
is under way, the collection of data, relat
ing to South American trade and the con
ditions under which the United States
merchants, manufacturers and producers
may take part in it will at once be under
taken. , .
Instructions have already been prepared
to direct the efforts of an agent of the
Pacific Commercial Museum, who is in
South* America. Samples will be collect
ed which will show the goods that are
eold in South American countries now, the
fctyle of packing the goods, also the pro
ductions of South America, and data will
fe'ive merchants and manufacturers all the
information available to aid them in ex-
Tending the market for their goods south
ward. This will have especial Interest for
San Francisco, the trade of this city
having rapidly increased in South Amer
ica with the addition of new steamship
lines to the shipping facilities of the
port.
A very lntrresting-showlng of the trade
of the Philippines has Just been received
from the Insular division of the "War
Department. The fact is learned that in
ten months the imports Into the Philip
pines amounted to $20,143,152 and the ex
ports in the same period were $19.372,S3cÂ».
The total direct exports from the United
States werÂ«Â» only $l r 7<0.656. Imports from
other countries were as follows:
United Kingdom, M.231,918; Spain. $1,643 -
f56; Germany. $1,176,120: China. $2,596,627;
Hongkong, $6,085,510; British East Indies,
f2.19S.7S9.
The statistics of imports from Hongkong
to the Philippines undoubtedly cover a
large amount of poods from this port,
which have taken the Hongkong route in
default of any direct steamer line from
Ban Fransieo to Manila. The new tariff
for the Philippines is expected, to extend
the use of the necessaries of life among
the Filipinos, the reductions in duties be
lnc larce.

death of Dr. Popper, Deputy Coroner
Charles W. Mechan told how he had been
notified by Mr. Parent of the death of
Miss Van Ornum and of the suspicious
circumstances attending it. With Detec
tive Dillon he went to the residence of Dr.
Popper, on Devlsndero street. Ho took
with him the medicine bottles found in
the room. Dr. Popper was at home, and
said he never talked to more than one
person at a time, and that he would not
break the rule in* favor of the officers.
Meehan talked to nlm, as did the detec
tive.- To the deputy coroner the doctor
said he might have put up the medicine
shown him; that he might have labels
similar to those on the bottles in his pos
session; that he might have treated Miss
Van Ornum, although he. never asked
names.
To Detective Dillon the doctor was
equally laconic, and when It was suggest
ed that a search of the premises be made
he refused to permit It. This was unsat
isfactory, and Dillon telephoned to the
police station for help. Detectives "Wren
and Bailey were sent out to the place and
the search was made. The police had been
watching Popper for a long-time. He had
once been arrested for sending prohibited
matter through the mails in the interest
of his nefarlou3 trade.
"I asked him," said Detective Dillon,
"whether everything in ; the house be
longed to him. He said that everything
did, and when T found the labels, similar
to those on the medicine bottles, and
showed them to him he said, 'You have
found the incriminating evidence.'. He
was placed under arrest, and upon his
asking why was told that he would be in
formed at the central station. Then he
said, 'Excuse me for a moment, gentle
men.' and turned to a bureau in the
room. I do not know whether he took a
bottle from the bureau, but wh*n , he
turned again he had drunk the greater
part of the contents of a bottle he held
in his hand and which he threw to the
floor, scattering a. few drops of the con
tents upon Detective Bailey. 'I have
fooled you all,' Popper said, and fell to
the floor in convulsions. He was < dead
within a very short time." â¢"Â» Â¦
Autopsy Surgeon - Bacigalupl testified
that Popper had died from carbolic acid
poisoning, and that closed the case. The
jury found that Miss Van Ornum, aged 33
years, came to her death through "taking
medicines sold her by one Dr.- Popper for
the purpose of producing an abortion."
The verdict in the case of Dr. Popper was
that he had come to his death by taking
carbolic acid administered by himself with
suicidal intent. - . :
The Labels Exposed Him.
I* the Inquiry into the cause of the
Dr. Charles IÂ«. Morgan, toxlcologlst to
the Board of Health, said -he had found
traces of the fiber of cotton, root in the
stomach, but not enough . to have pro
duced death. Cotton root is not a power
ful poison, and all that was contained in
the bottle shown \rould not kill a person
In ordinary health. 'The internal medicine
used was principally cotton root.
Then Parent recounted the story already
told by him of how Miss Van. Ornum,
against his advice, took the nostrums
given her by Popper, whose fee Â¦ was to
be 115. ,
Dr. James D. Murphy, assistant at the
Emergency Hospital; told of Miss Van Or
num's arrival at the hospital in strong
convulsions. He thought- she had been
poisoned, and the contents of the stomach
showed coloring matter, similar to the
color of the medicine in one of the phials
found in the dead girl's room. He knew
nothing of the connection of Dr. , Popper
with the case at that time.
Parent Tells His Story.
He is bald and middle aged and a trifl*
hard of hearing, but the dead girl seemed
to have been devoted to him. despite the
fact that he had a wife and children in
Los Angeles, and his feeling for her had
something of manliness in it. "I tried to
preserve her good name," he said. . "She
had been registered at the Emergency
Hospital as Mrs. Parent and, although I
sat by her dying bed all night in the hos
pital, it was not until it became certain
that she could not live that I told the
physician who she really was. Then, on
his advice, I wrote a message to her pa
rents in Chico and the doctor signed it.
Her people are respectable."
Charles H. Parent, the married man who
was Miss Van Ornum's friend, does not
seem to relish the position in which fato
has placed him. He was represented by
Judge Dibble, but the latter did not find
it necessary to take any par, in the pro
ceedings.
The Jury had been impaneled and had
viewed both bodies several days ago. It
was made up of E. D. Berri. foreman;
Charles Boldermann. C. A. Hoffman. M.
S. Cullen. Charles H. Williams. Frank
Butler, Nels Olesen and William H.
Ycung. Every man was in his place on
time, and the first witness called was
Charles H. Parent.
"I wished to preserve the grood name of
Miss Van Ornum," Parent said. â¢
CORONER LELAND and a Jury
yesterday held an Inquiry into the
causes that produced the deaths
of Miss Van Ornum and Dr. Vic
tor Popper, the man whom the
law would, In all probability, have held
accountable for her fate had not he taken
it into his own hands to put himself be
yond accountability to man's tribunals.
One inquest followed the other, that of
Miss Van Ornum coming first. It was a
kind of gruesome double event, and it
drew as many of the morbidly curious as
could get- into the small inquest room at
the Morgue.

nearly all on local account. Â¦ The early strength

good export demand and covering by shorts.

The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"The moderate amount of gold sent to Ger
many this week revived attention to the un
satisfactory business conditions in that coun
try, but these are unlikely to have any imme
diate effect here. No Important demand upon
our-etock of gold Is in prospect. . and with In
creasing supplies from the Klondike and the
Transvaal, the question of our money market
being seriously disturbed by gold shipments,'
feed not yet be seriously discussed. The con
tinued - heavy excess â¢ of exports over Imports
is a factor highly favorable to us In the Inter
national exchangee. Indications point to a
continuance of these conditions, for we are
approaching the export season and both grain
and cotton bills will soon be In better supply.
Just cow the * United States is in a position
Of wonderful Â¦ financial strength, being fully
aWe to meet â¢ not only its own unprecedented
requirements, but also to afford Europe the
helping hand and so etave off disaster. Ordi
nary influences affecting the market are of a
favorable nature. The crop situation continues
good, and a big wheat crop means good times
for* the farmer. Railroad earnings maintain
their large Increases with surprising steadi
ness. General business is in excellent shape.
ar.<J there is every prospect of a good fall
trade. Even " the " textile trades," which' have
bÂ«en the elowest to respond, are feeling the
touch of- prosperity, and both cotton and woolen
goods, last Â¦ week . were^ in better demand than
for many months. In the iron trade the ac
tivity Ft ill far surpasses all records, and If iron
i* to bÂ« considered the best trade barometer
lhÂ« country mutt .indeed be prosperous, a fact
which the most confirmed pessimist must con
cede. Another Important element of strength
in- the great scarcity of good Investments,
rr.anj- of the cld-tim.- securities having been
entirely withdrawn from the market. The va
rious deals of one scrt or another have, it is
estimated* withdrawn- from the market over
JfOO.WO.OOO of securities -during â¢ the last two
yearel How for this sum has been made good
hy return of securities'- from abroad and by
new Is5ues'lt is Impossible to calculate, but
every- one. knows, thit the supply of desirable
investments 1s exceedingly limited exJrpt at
almost prohibitive prices. If this condition is
not relieved speculative activity will be forced
into other and probably less desirable chan
nels but this is a s'.tuatlon that can be met
when it comes. At present the general market
in ln-gocd condition. -and," with heavy July dis
bursements dose at hand, , the prevailing ln-
Cuences would be favorable to a higher
market-were' it not for the monetary situation.
This, as "intimated- above, may- prove to be the
controlling feature. . Tight .money would debar
sny important prolonged bull campaign."
'Affairs on Wall Street.
' Mail aflTiees from New York say:
"Dried fruit* show very .little activity. Cur
rants are Quiet on. the spot. Stocks in bond
on Jose 1 are reported to have been 1.431,231
lbs. compared with 4,318,952. at the same date
last year. New crop currants are offering at
about 2c under the present prices, but â¢ the
trade -shows so interest Â« yet. California
prunes are In quite good demand from the
regular trade for the season, Â»0-100s going out
particularly well. Oregons of all sizes are
becoming scarce, and are selling right along
tn a small ' way. A little business is doing in
Valencia layer . raisins. Apricots and peaches
are In light demand. Apples, both future and
â¢pot. are flat, except for spot waste, which is
firm and in some demand. Brazil nuts are

Shares sold
vere circulated yesterday by the explicit etate
n>nts mt-out over night. It was doubtless
>wlng to this feeling of uneasiness that strong
<upporting orders were put in the market â¢ at
ihe openinjr to guard against any violent dis
turbances of prices. The advances which were
caused In that way were, in fact, met by con
siderable selling orders by the element which
profesbed to expect further trouble. The per
sistence of the support and the news that the
bank which was affected yesterday had met
to-day's debit balance at the Clearing-houss
quieted the slight tendency to feverishness in
the market. Afterward the trading took on
the tone of the recent market and considera
tion returned to the money market. When the
money rates stiffened to about 6 per cent and
Increased offerings came upon the market,
prices yielded easily. This period of greatest
wÂ»akness in the market was also that of the
greatest activity. Stock ' speculators, however,
are prone to persist in an optimistic spirit in
the hope of money market relief. This week
the hope has hinged on the probability of the
repayment to the market of some very large
borrowings â¢ by syndicates and railroad com
panies. Very -possibly yesterday's disturbance
to credit, light though It was, had Its effect
In the shifting of loans to-day and precipi
tated thÂ« sprinkling of liquidation owing to
the difficulty of securing new accommodations.
The decline In prices was most pronounced In
St. Paul. Union Pacific, Manhattan and some
of the less prominent stocks which have been
under manipulation recently for an advance.
St. Paul fell an extreme 2% under last night.
The latter part of the day was taken up by a
very general but desultory recovery. -With the
cessation of selling pressure, friends of differ
ent stocks bid them - up again and the hope
of the professional element was a story that
the Secretary of the Treasury will pay out
Government Interest immediately in anticipa
tion of the July 1st disbursements. . Not a few
of the most Important stocks were lifted well
above last night's level, while the larger num
ber rallied -to that level. The closing was very
dull but firm.
The bend market was dull, but prices yielded
in sympathy with stocks. Total sales, par
value, J2.M5.000." United States refunding twos

The rooms of the Republican Primary
League in the Baldwin Annex, 930 Market
street, are thronged every night with rep
resentative men from the several Assem
bly districts -of the city. . The league is
doing splendid work in the cause of cre
ating public interest in the approaching
primary election. Citizens are assured
that the directors of the organization
have no candidates to favor and no indi
vidual .interests to promote. All Repub
licans are invited to join in the movement
to secure good local government. . The
bosses,- seeing .their, occupations vanish,
are setting up the cry that a political or
ganization to control State affairs is being
created in San Francisco. The Republi
can Primary League was organized to
awaken in the minds of the voters of thia
city a sense of their duty to register and
vote. A large Republican vote at the pri
maries will insurr a nominating conven
tion that will register the will of the peo
ple. A large- vote at the primaries will
Insure a much larger -vote at the munici
pal election next November. Leading men
of the city are giving to the league the
support: that an honest effort to obtain
good government, deserves. The remark
able -success of the Â¦ league excites the
alarm of the bosses.

There were many political workers and
strikers in the Palace court yesterday,
who were loud in* proclaiming that the
time had arrived for the redemption of
promises made at Sacramento. The un
rewarded workers threaten to camp on
thÂ© trail of the highland mighty dispen
sers of patronage until employment is
given to them. Some of â¢ the promises
were made during the eventful Senatorial
struggle of 1S99. The session of the Har
bor Commissioners and the presence in
the city yesterday of Governor Gage and
several of his political advisers caused
the holders of unredeemed political
pledges to congregate on Colonel Klrk

nothing more for the expectant than to

The passengers and officers of the va
rious regiments who came home on the
Thomas were the following named:
Many Officers on the Thomas.
The Thomas made the run from Manila
in twenty-nine days, via N'agasakl twen
ty-two days and Yokohama eighteen and
a half days. Will Parker, a private of
Company E, Forty-ninth Infantry, died
of pneumonia as the. Thomas was enter
ing port. Francis H. Kegarice. private of
Company D. Forty-seventh Infantry, died
while the ship was at -Nagasaki. Satur
day last Joseph Conlon, a deck : boy,
jumped overboard and was drowned. He
had been sick for over a week and finally
became mentally deranged. He was lock
ed up in the hospital, but made his escape
and, reaching the deck, jumped over be
fore anybody could reach him. The ves
pel was stopped and a boat lowered, but
no trace of the body could be found.
On the outward trip of the Thomas a
very handsome sword was presented to
Captain W. M. Coulling. quartermaster In
charge of the ship. The captain was ap
pointed to the regular army before the
trsKsport sailed, but the officers of the
vessel did not make their presentation un
til they were crossing the 180th meridian.
Then Captain Buford. on behalf, of the
ship's company, made the presentation.
Csuptain Coulling was taken completely by
surprise and could hardly find words with
which to thank his shipmates.
The army transports Thomas and Bu
foni arrived from Manila yesterday. Each
brought her full complement of returning
volunteers. The Kilpatrick, due about
Sunday next, will be the last of the fleet.
She has aboard the Forty-third Regiment
and on her arrival all the volunteers will
be home. tTncle Sam is under agreement
to have the men here by the end of June,
and it will be touch and go in the case of
the 1 Kilpatrick. That vessel is now. twen
ty-four days out and if she does not make
a better showing than her sister ship, the
Buford. she will be away late.

Bodies of the Dead in
West Virginia.
' WILLIAMSON. W. Va.. June 26,â There
is no longer any doubt that the list of
dead, the result of the recent flood, will
exceed, 100. Parties reaching here, this
evening from the upper end of the flooded
district bring 1 the first autnentlc informa
tion received from the scene of disaster.
The section visited by the Hood wa3
thickly settled, but, as the population con
sists chiefly of miners, who were at work
at the time, the large majority of the dead
are women and children, and. thrilling,
stories of rescue are told. At Eckman u
mother climbed a huge pillar of a railway
trestle, holding to her breast her only,
child. Her home was washed away, but
the mother and child were saved.
Fifteen persons are .said to 'have been
drowned at Eckman. . At Keystone prob
ably thirty .persons perished. In .one in
stance persons fled to an island and
climbed small trees, only to be swept away
fifteen minutes later by the tide;- which
was filled with debris of every kind. Cn
Dry Fork the loss of life is great. Bodies
are scattefedall along the stream, many
of which will never, be identified. : Seven
saloons at- Keystone were washed away,
four lives being lost in one:.of them. -Dr.
Hatfleld's home at .this â¢ point was-, not
washed away, as formerly reported, and
his family is safe. ! At Brooke the loss of
i property is severe, but only three lives ai e
said ta have been- lost, there.' â¢ 'Â¦-... â¢
v The region from Ennis to. Davy, forty
three miles, is completely in ruins. Hun
dreds of mine mules can be seen in heap*,
intermingled, with human bodies. Near
Davy a horse was. found. lodged In a drift
and a .. human j> body dangling from the
saddle; the^man's foot having hung" in the
stirrup..-- A report has just reached here
that fifteen bodies are lodged in a drift at
Hatfleld tunnel, twenty, miles east of this
city. 'Near Burke a man ? saw his brother
1 sinking in .the "flood and -plunged, in' ?o
rescue him.' Both were drpwned. ....
-C. F. Clifford,. -train. dispatcher. for^the.
Norfolk and "Western, walked from Ennla
to Davy, and now has control of the tele
graph lines at. the latter. point. He says
that on â¢ his Journey he saw five dead
bodies at Eckman, seven- at Keystone and
fifteen scattered : along the shores." He
pressed on. through without stopping, and
those were on his direct line of travel, fie
says this, number" may be largely in
creased, ft is expected that, the loss of
life along the little streams emptying- into
the Keystone has been great. These
streams have not yet been' "explored.
Twenty. barrels of whisky, were caught in
the river at "Welch. "A" report has .reached
here that most of the colored miners are
laying off there on a protracted spree and
that street fights are numerous. It is dif
ficult for the authorities to handle the sit
uation. Much theft is reported In the dev
astated district. Even clothing, is being
torn from dead bodies. Most of the bodies
being found along Tug River have beea
washed from the Elkhorn River. The loss
of : property by the flood on the Tug and
Elkhorn rivers is now roughly estimated
at from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000.

Grape-Nuts and Postum both furnish the

NEW YORK, JunÂ© 26.â The second day
of the auction sale of Klnar Edward's
sherry drew a large attendance, says a
-World dispatch from London. Man; well
known Arjer leans were present, and they
were among the most active bidders.
"Wines from the Buckingham Palace cel
lars were sold off. Most of these were of
old vintages, dating from 1S69 to 1879. J.
Pierpont Morgan bid In several cases from,
the bins representing both the St. James
Palace and the Buckingham Palace cel
lars. So did Charles T. Yerkes and Fox
hall Keene.
Richard Croker's representative bought
fifty-one dozen bottles of pale golden
sherry from St. James Palace, bottled in
1879. These will be shipped by Croker a3
a present- to the Democratic Clu)>.
The Tammany leader's agent also
bought liberally from Buckingham Palace
bins. American theatrical persons bought
freely. The auctioneers received several
commissions to bid In lots for New York
ers, Including the proprietors of well
known hotels. It has been suggested that
an auction sale of the empty bottles
would bring good prices, for they are
blown with the royal arms.

KING'S SHERRY
FOR TAMMANY
Three hours elapsed between the time
when the Lusitanla struck and the time
the passengers started to disembark. This
delay- was occasioned by the difficulty In
controlling the. passengers and handling
the boats. All the passengers and crew
agree that if the Lusitania had struck the
rocks In roughep weather not a soul on
board would have been saved.
The panic among the passengers was In
tense. The drawing of. knives by the pas
sengers was not general, but occurred In
Isolated Instances only. - ,-.
The steamer Glencoe arrived here at
midnight, bringing six first, fifteen second
and 436 steerage passengers and ninety
three of the crew of the Lusltania. Cap
tain McNay and the -chief officers of the
ship remain with the wreck. -.The passen
gers are almost entirely .Russian and Pol
ish Jews. The steamer struck at 1:30 a. m.
during a dense fog. Captain McNay had
to force his vessel upon the reef, for if ho
reversed the engines the whole ship's bot
tom would have been torn out and the
would have sunk Instantly. .
The passengers of the , Lusitanla had a
terrible experience. The first knowledge
which they had of the disaster was when,
owing to the ship scraping over the rocks,
they were hurled from their berths by the
shock. A scene of , great excitement /fol
lowed. Five hundred people were clamor-
Ing to escape, while the crew tried to
pacify them and launch the boats. Somo
of the male passengers In their attempt to
seize the boats trampled the women under
foot and fought . the crew with knives.
Some, of the* more cool-headed of the pas
sengers assisted the crew In their effort3
to get out the boats. . "
The Lusitanla was bound round Cape
Race for Montreal with a large cargo and
a shipload of passengers. She mistook her
course In a dense fog. and went ashore
near Renews, twenty miles north of Capo
Race, before daybreak. The ship ran over
a reef and hangs against a cliff. The pas T
sengers, who were mostly emigrants, were
panic-stricken. They g stampeded and
fought for the boats, but were, overcome
by the officers and crew. The rougher ele
ment among the passengers used knives.
The women and children were first landed
and the men followed. The crew stood by
the ship.; â¢ ..Â¦..-; ".- Â¦
ST., JOHNS, N. F., June 26.â The Orient
'Steam Navigation Company's steamer Lu
sitania, Captain McNay, from . Liverpool
; June IS for Montreal, having: about 500
passengers on board, was wrecked - last
night off Cape Ballard.

workers. After nearly six weeks of con
troversy between -, employer and employe
no change has obtained in the situation.
Both sides are making claims, and each
disputes the statements of the other. ;
R. I. Wisler, at the headquar
ters of the Iron Trades Council, speaking
of the conditions, said: .
"Eastern reports indicate that the ma
chinists' strike is being rapidly settled by
the granting of hours, j wages and over
time. The riffraff of the East Is now being
shipped, to San Francisco to take the
places of the men who helped to build up
the iron industries of this city. The union
machine shops that concede the schedule
are being forced to close down by being
refused material by the merchants who
previously supplied them. In addition,
these merchants are threatened that if
they do not join the Metal Trades Associa
atlon at once, after the strike Is settled
they i will be boycotted and refused ma
terial. The matter, has gone so far now
that sales of completed machinery have
been stopped in a number of instances "
Â¦ The Union Iron Works Is in receipt if a
number of replies In response to telegrams
sent out some days ago, which contradict
the statements advanced by the machin
ists. At Philadelphia. the Neafy & Levy
Shipbuilding- Company announced Â¦ that
they had granted .the machinists an ad
vance of 4 per cent. C. B. Orcutt, presi
dent of the Newport 1 News Shipbuilding
Company, says that "all reports of a com
promise with the strikers are pure fabri
cations." f . '.. -, \ -Â¦ *Â¦
Among other firms which were named in
the dispatches from the East as having
given' in to â¢ the men were' the Mid vale
Steel Company of Philadelphia, Brownell
Company of Dayton, O.; Bath Iron Works
of Bath, Me.j.AUis ChftJmers Company of
Scranton, Pa.; Bethlehem Steel Company
of Bethlehem, Pa!, and the Delaware
Shipbuilding Company of Chester, Pa. All
telegrams are signed by the executive of
ficers of the various concerns, and are of
the same tenorâ that there has been no
compromise and none "is' intended.

CAMPFIRE
SCINTILLATIONS AT
CAMP REVERIE
The evening programme about the night- Â¦
ly campfire at Camp Reverie Is -always an
Z-.terestingv not to say a jolly one, for
X?. ?at minds unbend Jn those redwood fast
r- jses under the fitful light of the burn
ii j logs. To hear Charles Fergnson recite
â¢' ang Robert of Sicily" in his exquisitely
modulated voice is something not soon to
be forgotten. Jack London's stories per
haps never had a better setting: certainly
a. no more appreciative audience. Eugene
Del Mar's barytone is as mellow as the
light which the young moon sheds on the
happy circle. Miss A.- M. Hicks of Berke
ley, the head of the Hearst Domestic In
dustries, has the happy faculty of calling
out whatever talent the camp may em
brace in making . up these programmes,
and the good nature of those called upon
for entertainment is inexhaustible. Mrs. C.
B. Grunsky's reading of humorous stories
is as irresistible as Mr. Ewald Grunsky's
rendering of dialect. Miss Emily J. Ham-,
ilton of Alameda is as obliging with her
magnificent talent for whistline as is Miss
May Irwin of Oakland with ner fine so- :
rirano voice.
The prand piano on the commodious
platform sometimes proves too enticing
for the young folks who trip a few meas
ures before the early bed hour at which
the camp breaks up. On Saturday an am
ateur dramatic company from San Fran
cisco will arrive, bringing their own stage
setting, which promises a good time for
the guests at Camp Reverie.

ernor George W. Baxter and his wife,
who came here from Denver to await the
arrival of Mrs. Tevis, their daughter,
who is returning on the steamship Doric
Last evening Mrs. Bedford, who is a
warm personal friend of the Baxters, told
the pathetic story. She said that she ar
rived on the transport Thomas at Yoko
hama on June 8. the day after Tevis died.
When she learned of his sad death she
hastened to the side of Mrs. Tevis to
condole with her in her creat grief.
Hugh Tevis was in good health when
he reached Yokohama, and after a day
or eo of rest after the ocean voyage he
journeyed, accompanied by his wife, into
the interior of Japan. While visiting a
small town he complained of feeling in
disposed, but nothing was thought of the
matter, as it was believed that he was
only fatigued and that he would recover
a'ft*r a rest. Tevis. however, grew rap
idly Â¦worse, and it was decided to move
the Invalid to Yokohama. whÂ«re the best
medical attendance could be secured.
The return trip to Yokohama was a sad
one, aÂ» Tevis Bteadlly grew worse. Dr.
Eldridge, an old friend of the family,
was In Yokohama and he was hastily
called. The moment he saw Tevis he
pronounced the case serious and said
that the sufferer had a severe attack of
appendicitis. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, an
eminent Philadelphia physician, who was
also in Yokohama, was called in con
sultation. He eaid that the disease had
made such progress that Tevis* life hung
on a thread. An operation was necessary,
but he feared that the patient was not
Ftrong enough to 6urvive the shock.
Drs. Mitchell and Eldridge performed the
operation and Tevis expired soon after
ward. . The f hock to his system -was too
great en his weakened condition.

CAUSES EXCITEMENT
Climbs Out on Fire Escape and
Hangs by Hands In
Midair.
' Jack Lreahy. one-legged, and a maniac
from the use of drugs, created excitement
at Kearny and Pacific streets last night
by climbing out on a fire escape, sixty feet
from the ground, - and yelling "Murder!
Police!" He crawled over the edge of the
escape and hung by his hands in midair.
He appeared ready to" drop at any mo
ment, but was rescued by Officers Holmes,
Sllva. Ward and Skein. . .. \
Leahy was crazed by the use, of drugs
and Imagined he was pursued by a mob
of fcoldlers. He sought to escape from the
mob his diseased mind had created by
getting out of the window. . He was sent
to the Emergency Hospital.
Two soldiers who returned from Manila
about six months ago and were among the
convalescents at- Fort Baker and a small
black-and-tan dog named Tipsy were the
principals -in an accident on the bay yes
terday afternoon that resulted in the
drowning of Stephen -Allen, musician in
Battery G, Third Artillery. ; . 5?
Allen and Harry Barry,' private in the
Sixty-second Company, coast artillery,
were "skylarking" around Â¦ Sausalito early
in. the. afternoon ' and, as soldiers will,
drinking more than was good for them.
The dog, which belonged to \ Allen, was
with them. ' . Â¦ -
In the course of their .wanderings along
the water front of the pretty suburb they
came upon a boat owned by Dan Eustls
and the notion took the soldiers that they
would go for a row on the bay. Barry
took the oars and Allen the tiller, and the
black-and-tan was a sitter. They reached
a- point about a mile off Sausallto in the
direction of Alcatraz when, the wind com
ing/through the. Gate strongly ana the
seas beginning to run, they concluded that
It was time to return. As Barry had
grown tired of rowing. It was proposed
that the men change places. Allen assent
ed and, getting up, attempted to pass for
ward, at the same time, that Barry was
comlnc aft.
It wasÂ«at this moment that the men in
the boat were seen >from the pilothouse
dead ahead by the first mate of the ferry
steamer San Rafael on her 3 o'clock trip
to this city. The,soldiers were, apparently
reeling In the little boat, falling down and
getting up again. In reality they were
trying to pass each other on the same side
or the boat. Then a sea a little heavier
than any that had gone before caught
them, and the mate of the San Rafael saw
the boat eo over.
A boat was lowered and pulled away to
where the men were seen struggling in the
water. Only one man was picked up. and
he was delirious. Stephen Allen had gone
to the bottom, though he had been In the
water only ten minutes | all told. The
black-and-tan dog, wet and shivering, was
found crouched on the bottom of the'up
turned boat. -
The surviving soldier. Barry, was taken
to the Harbor Hospital and, after the salt
water had been pumped out of him and a
slisrht wound on his cheek had been at
tended to. told the story of the tragedy.
He said he and Allen were not fighting. He
was a good swimmer, he said, and placed
Allen on the bottom of the boat, but he
fell off several times. Allen, when he fell
off the boat once, kicked Barry in the
face. Inflicting the wound mentioned, j
