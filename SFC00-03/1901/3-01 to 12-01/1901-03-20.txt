It is further stated that when the United
States annexed Porto Rico the State De
partment sent no notices to any of the
powers; they. were supposed to take note
themselves of the President's proclama
tion and the acts of Congress. The old
Consuls retained their original exequaturs
issued by the Spanish Government, these
being recognized by the United States
military authorities as sufficient for the
purpose.- The status of our Consuls in
South Africa Is precisely the same; they
hold their old exequaturs, and these are
recognized by the military authorities as
sufficient. But in the case of Porto Rico
whenever a" Consul retires his Govern
ment makes application for an exequatur
directly to the United States authorities.
It being the lule to recognize de facto
administrations In this manner, and' it is
presumed that when a change is made in
our consular representatives In South Af
rica the application for an exequatur will
be made to whatever authority happens
for the moment to be in de facto posses
sion of the place to which the Consul is
accredited.
United States probably will be for the
first time fixed when a Consul General la

"So far they have only met the Boers
in the open plains. The English public
for some unknown reason has looked upon
the war all along as mere child's play,
notwithstanding the lesson which they re

During the discussion of the composition
of the Transvaal Concessions Commission
Arthur Basil Liberal, asserted
that the commission was made up of per
sons affiliated with several great South
African companies.
Chamberlain replied that while he wouJfl

Hiding Truth From Public.
Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secre
tary, informed the House of Commons
yesterday that General Botha has reject
ed the peace terms offered him. General
Potha, Chamberlain said, had conveyed
the information in a letter to General
Kitchener, in which he announced that he
was not disposed to recommend the terms
of peace General Kitchener was instruct
ed to offer him to the earnest considera
tion of the Government. General Â¦ Botha
added that his Government and its chief
officers entirely agreed with- his view.
Chamberlain added: "I propose to lay the
papers connected with the negotiations on
the table to-night."
Announced by Chamberlain.
LONDON. March 20.â The issuance
of Parliamentary papers on the
negotiations between Lord Kltch
ccw and General Botha is de
layed. General Botha's refusal
to accept the peace terms offered, him is
commented upon with an evident sense of
relief. The idea that Lord Kitchener Ini
tiated the negotiations instead of General
Botha, as had been supposed, is unpalata

The Dally -Mall, under the editorial cap
tion "Our Rejected Suit," asks why the
Government Instructed Lord Kitchener to
sue for peace after the murder of the

This is a public question, not a private dis

The Mayor, \ after a consultation with
his friends, drafted a statement for the
press, which is as follows:
Phelan Calls Prince a Gambler.

- His Honor, the Mayor, oneÂ© again
availed himself of the press and put forth
another statement. In speaking of the
meetings between himself and the Prince
and the discussions as to the track war,
the Mayor felt that, as a matter of justice,
he was obliged to conclude that Ponia
towski was not "a real prince."
"True Princes," said the Mayor, "are

truths.". \ -Â¦Â¦\

After a few meetings came the public
statement of the Mayor as to his reasons

la what Touchstone^ called "the retort

Then came the public statement of
Prince Poniatowskl. He called the Mayor
to acount and took him to task for acting
in bad -faith. The Prince threw sarcasm
Into his statement and made the Mayor
feel uncomfortable. This was undoubtedly
"the quip modest."
Prince Poniatowskl follows this up with
a statement which made all men anxious.
The descendant , of . the Polish nobility
designated Mayor Phelan as "a poor little
fellow." He spoke of the Mayor present
ing a "pitiful sight." and that he was in
.a "comatose state."
Accordlngto Touchstone this was "the
reply churlish."
Mayor Phelan Jumped into the fray at
this point with ardor. The chief execu

FFirit let us part the portals of the past.
It appears that the point was raised not
long ago in the States of Ohio and Rhode
Island, where a similar constitutional pro
vision exists. Tho Supreme Court of Ohio
held that a parsonage, although built on
ground which might otherwise be exempt
as attached to the church edifice, did not
come within the exemption. The ground
in such a case, maintained the court, was
appropriated to a new and different use;
instead of it being used exclusively for
public worship it became a place- of pri
vate residence. Nor did lt make any dif
ference that by the usage of the cnurcn
the presence of a ptiest or pastor was es
sential to conduct the services of publlo
worship.
State Controller Colgan, ln answer to a
letter of inquiry, has written to A.C. Mo
Manus, secretary of the Christian church
of Santa Rosa, expressing his Individual
view that under the new constitutional
provision exempting church property from
taxation church mortgages are not to be
assessed or taxed, the Controller holding
that the mortgage is a part of the prop
erty itself.
It is expected that the State Board of
Examiners will shortly Issue to County
Assessors a letter of instructions relative
to the general subject of taxing church
property and . mortgages.

wWi the State Department, has nothing
but discouraging reports to make of this
Important branch of the negotiations. It
appears that the Ministers cannot agree
upon any uniform Â¦- basin of Â¦ indemnity,
some "of the powers demanding enormous
sums. The amount of Indemnity asked by
the United States is $25,000,000. > >, â¢
In most eases thÂ« . powers contend for
the right of fixing their, own : indemnities.
The result 'is that each power, in order
not' to be outdone,, fixes, the' total 'of /its
claims at Â¦ an enormous- figure, | far beyond
anything knowjj.. to the history of indem
nity collections. â¢ When the point is made
that the sum total of these national claims
Is far beyond the ability of China" to : pay,'
some of the nations reply by professing
a willingness to cut down. their claims as
soon as. the fact . Of China's inability is
manifested. \ . , ...

ST. PETERSBURG, Monday. March IS.
Alarm pervades high circles here. The
police have notified house owners to have
their house police report for duty and
hold themselves in constant readiness.
It is apparently confirmed that three
students were killed yesterday. The Cos
sacks rode Into ; the crowds on the side

their knotted whips. The students and
workingmen threw rubber shoes, canes
and snowballs at the Cossacks. It Is re
ported that one Cossack was killed.
An official of the political police said a
thousand prisoners were taken, among
them being 350 women students. The
presence of workingmen among the' riot
ers rendered this demonstration more
dangerous than any known in a genera

Gossip Has It That He Will
Be Appointed Harbor
Commissioner.
Political gossip on the topic of Harbor
Commissioner to succeed Major P. J. Har
ney Is unusually active. A few days ago
The Call mentioned that the insiders wero
sure a "dark horse" would win the race.
Last night information was received
which leads to the belief that the Gov
ernor will appoint Wakefield Baker to
the Harbor Commission. Mr. Baker is a
member of the executive committee of the
Republican State Committee and in the
campaign last fall rendered the party
good service. He is a merchant of high
standing and excellent business attain
ments.
Many of the politicians still adhere to
the opinion that ex-Supervisor Edward
Aigeltinger is in the race. It is known
he Is supported by merchants" of the high
est grade. Senators Leavitt and Bettman
are said to be hopeful of executive favor,
but the Indications are the Governor will
recognize some well-known business man
of this city. Major Harney's term of four
years has expired and the Governor iy
therefore at liberty to appoint the major's
successor at any time.
Governor Gage came to the city last
Saturday night, but left here Monday af
ternoon. Colonel George Stone, chairman
of the Republican State Committee, re
turned to San Francisco from Honolulu
yesterday. .Â¦ -:v;=---. Y "
A story comes from trustworthy sources
that Governor Gage and Paris Kilbucn,
president of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners, are slightly at outs. The
patronage of the water front has not been
placed according to the wishes of the Gov
ernor It is said that Commissioner Kil

The first attempt was planned to be
made on the occasion of the jubilee of the
Naval Cadet Corps, whose ball the Czar
had promised to attend. Ills Majesty
was ready to start and was awaiting h".Â«i
carriage when General Kleigels .arrived
at the palace and informed him he must
not go, several suspicious~persons belong
ing to the Revolutionist party having been
arrested at the Nicolal bridge, with 'arms
and forged passports. He informed hla
Majesty that the prisoners were probably
emissaries of the Central Nihilist Com
mittee at Zurich. The visit was accord
ingly abandoned.
The second affair occurred In the middle
of January, when the Czar, accompanied
by his mother, visited the "Ceramic ex
hibition. When entering one of ths
rooms members of the committee
who were escorting the imperial party
noticed that an unknown man wa^
hurriedly approaching the Czar. As the
public had been excluded and those au
thorized to attend had been carefully se
lected, the presence of a stranger excited
suspicion. Several of the Czar's party
hastened to meet him to lead him away.
Thereupon the man thrust his hand In huÂ«
pocket He was instantly seized. When
searched a bomb was found in his pocket.
He has since disappeared from public
view. and. the correspondent adds, it wi'l
probably be a long time before any one
learns of his whereabouts
BERLIN, March 19.â Stories are current
of recent attempts upon the Czar's. life in

time, ; but considerably lower than the
figures to which it has since risen. The

Another story is that Harriman did not
succeed in obtaining as much Burlington

ord a report said to hr.ve been made by
Schu>ler during the fight between the old
OakKinl Company and the Contra Costa,
showing the inferior quality of the water
drawn lrcm the catchment basins of the
latter tSumpuny. This evidence was barred
out by the â¢-Â¦ot.rt.
Sch-uyler admitted that he had approved
of the Denver plan, and also admitted
that two of the Spring Valley dams, those
at Pilareitos and Crystal Springs, wero
140 and 148 feet high, respectively. It was
further developed that the proposed Pi
nole dam was 145 feet high for only twen
ty-eight feet of its length.
â¢ Ar other report which the witness was
asked to explain was that of the consult"
ing engineers of the Citizens' Water Com

one, recommending the construction of a
dam 250 feet high, while he cast doubt
upon the feasibility of the city's propose!
dam at Pinole on account of its height.

this year they assembled on the shore of

points as far distant as the Covelo reser

the order and for more than a week- the
pleasure-seeking aborigines forgot that
they were but the scattered .remnant of a
disappearing race. Beef was roasted for
the entire camp; clams and mussels were
baked in the seaweed on the beach and
the luscious abalone was hunted to its
death.
' In the olden times it was at these feasts
that the young bucks won their brides.
In the games and the chase they flaunted
their prowess before the eyes of the ad

of any such movement was what he saw
in to-day's papers.
"No plans of Intermediation." he said,
"have been discussed by the mine work
rrp' officials, and the only arrangements
made are for communications directly be
tween the operators and mine workers.
However, in the course of developments,
â¢we would be only too glad to avail our
eelves of any means 0/ bringing about the
end which we ere tn%ng to establish.
"Tht- report that I iltend going- to New
York with pome of the local officials is en
tirely unfounded, as thrre would be no
possible use in poing there unless we
knew we would be favorably received by
those Interested in the coal properties."
When aFkcd what he thought of the
opinion expressed by the Wllkesbarre
operators, reported as declaring: that the
companies as corporate bodies refused to
have any dealing? with the mine workers,
which are not Incorporated^ President
Mitchell answered: 'I do not think much
of that pretext. Xo labor organizations
are incorporated."
SCHANTOIC. Pa., March 13.â As a ro-
BUlt of conferences heid to-day between
President John MitchÂ«U of the United
Mine Workers and the three district pres
idents of the anthracite reelon communi
cations were sent oat this afternoon from
ihe United Mine Workers' headquarters to
the presidents of all tne coal companies
and ,the large individual operators.
These communications contained state
ments of the action of last week's conven
tion in passing the resolution asking their
attendance at the conference of April 1,
and further expressed their ac<juiescencc
in that action by the national president
and presidents of Districts 1, 7 and 9. No
attempt will be made to deliver any of
these messages in person, as was done in
the matter of the invitations to the con
ference of March 15.
President Mitchell on being asked
whether there was any possibility of the
operators being: approached throug-h a
third party, and their attendance at thÂ«
conference April 1 thus solicited, declared
that the only intimation he had received

RAPIDLY NEARING COMPLETION
Rolling Boer was scratched from the
final event at six and one-half furlongs,
leaving Articulate to go to the post a 3
to 5 chance. The brown colt won gallop
ing, while Specific lost the place to Rosor
monde, the only other ptarter.
After booking had progressed for quite
a time it was discovered that Beau Or
monde second choice for the six-furlong
run following, was on the delayed train.
The judges ordered all bets off. which
caused the price apainst Bonnie Llr.sak to
be shortened to 1 to 3. Pat Dunce's lilly
won. bat like a crackajack, for Aridrattus
put up a remarkably good argument. Cou
yer finished in. the show. ,,-':-Â¦
In downtown .circles it became noised
about that May Boy was "the goods" tn
the steeplechase and that two or three of
the other starters would 'lend a helping
hand. Somebody stubbed his toe If any
foundation existed for the rumor as the
top-weight, Olinthus, ridden by Worth
ington, went to the front and won all the
way. Lord ChestertiÂ«:M ran second, twen
ty lengths ahead of May Boy, while the
favorite, Eva Moe finished a cheap look
ing fifth.
Tommy Burns astride Edgardo put up
a powerful finish In the mile and a six
teenth, managing to make a dead heat of
it with the 2 to 5 favorite, .Wyoming.
When Rinaldo had tired with making the
pace O'Connor, witn the leg up on the
choice, locked horns with Burns from the
head of the stretch home. While many
thought Wyoming "got the nod" just as
many picked Edgardo. and as the Judge3
themselves could not separate them a
dead heat was announced. ; This meant
a loss to the backers of Wyoming, as all
bets are split.
Barney Schreiber's Kingston filly, Mrs.
Brunell. defeated an ordinary lot of maid
en three-year-olds in the fifth number at
five furlongs. Barney backed his entry,
getting 6 to 1, and Burns had her In front
from the jump. Luca, a 30 to 1 shot, ran
second, four lengths before Singer. Char
ley Thorpe rode the favorite, Katherine
Ennis. w.hich finished among the "also
rans."
the Immense crowd present was
testamentary to Â¦ the fact that rac
ing had resumed its normal con
dition again. The card was not
a weighty one, and Winnie O'Connor
had occasion to celebrate the reunion of
the opposing clans by finishing first on
four winner?, all favorites. A trifle mis
leading perhaps is the last statement, for
Wyoming tn the fourth event ran a dead
heat with Edgardo.
Business in the betting ring was good,
resembling old times. Eighteen. firms laid
odds, but as only two favorites were top
pled over the talent quit ahead of the
game.
Owing to the non-arrival of a horse train
from Oakland it was some minutes after
2 o'clock before the opening five-furlong
scramble was called.' The odds against
Vantlne, the mount of O'Connor, were
played frcm 2 down to 13 to 10, and the
mare won as shf- liked. St. Anthony tired
badly, losing the place to Foul Play.

Dispute About a Body.
The police were asked yesterday to ar
bitrate in a dispute over the body of Cor
nelius Soderman, who was fatally injured
at the Risdon Iron Works Saturday and
died Sunday fit St. Luke's Hospital. So
derman was a member of the Sailors'
Union, and when the union ascertained
that the body! had been sent to an un
dertaker's they sent a request that it be
handed over to the union's undertakers.
The request was complied with. Soder
man's relatives took a hand in the mat
ter and wanted the body handed over to
them for interment. Their request was
declined and they appealed to .the police,
who advised them to obtain a search war
rant. They applied for the warrant, but
"Warrant Clerk Fitzpatrick, backed up by
Judge Cabanlss, refused to Issue it, on the
ground that a dead body is not property.
ASKS CIVIL SERVICE
BOABD FOR MORE TIME
Scott Will Consult With His Attor
ney Before Appointing Elig-
ible Deputies.
Tax Collector Scott had a conference
with Civil Service Commissioners Freud
and Qulnn yesterday regarding" his inten
tions to put to work the men he had se
lected from the deputies' eligible list.
Scott agreed to appoint fourteen deputies,
who were certified by the commission on
February 13. but he left the same day on
a pleasure trip to Tahiti. When the depu
ties presented themselves at the tax of
fice the next morning there was no one
to swear them in, and up to date they
have not been assigned to duty.
Commissioner Freud asked Scott what
he intended to , do, and after parleying
Scott requested that he be granted an ex
tension of time .until .'he had consulted
with his -attorney, A. Ruef. - Scott said ho
desired to learn if the writ of mandate
served on the commission in the Seyden
rase affected his course. Freud informed
him that the writ concerned only the Civil
Service Commission, as it compelled it to
show cause why separate examinations
should be held for deputyshlps in the li
cense and tax offices. The injunction not
to certify any names for the positions
was of no effect, as tho fourteen certifica
tions had already been made to Scott and
had been accepted by that official.
Scott was given a copy of the writ,
which he will submit to his attorney, and
he will give a definite reply to the com
mission to-day. It is said that Scott's
anxiety for delay is the fact that the Tyr
rell bill, which passed both houses and is
in the hands of the Governor, will prohib
it him from discharging the old deputies
or any employes who have taken the oath
of office.
MAYOR PHELAN DECLARES THAT PRINGE PONATOWSKI IS A GAMBLER.
The counties of Shasta, Tehama, Butte,
Yuba, Sutter, Placer, Nevada, Sacramen
to, Glenn, Colusa, ,Yolo and Solano have
beaten all others In getting themselves
before the crowds of Eastern people who
are arriving on colonist tickets. Since
Monday of, the present week all -visitors
to the State Board of Trade have been
met and talked with by F. , E. Wright,
representing the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association aa secretary, and
he has been literally "overwhelmed by the,
Inquiries about the Sacramento Valley.
All the counties enumerated in the fore
going are members of the Sacramento De
velopment Association and j contribute
their funds to its maintenance. The State
Board of Trade has furnished the asso
ciation with desk room and other accom
modations. Â¦ y
While the Sacramento Valley people are
first In the field, the expectation Is that
the San Joaquin Valley Commercial As
sociation and perhaps the Santa Clara
Valley Improvement Club wijl soon take
measures to have their advantages as well
presented as are those of the northern
counties.
Some idea of the extent to which the
great ranches of the northern counties are
being broken up for the settling of the
Sacramento Valley is indicated by the lit
erature that Mr. Wright has. The great
Bldwell ranch and the C. D. Wilson ranch
in Butte County are on the list. The Wil
son ranch Is broken up into tracts of
from 160 to 600 acres. The Bldwell ranch
Is subdivided into tracts of from five acres
upward. The Wilson ranch embraces 22,
000 acres and the Bldwell ranch 23,000
acres. Prices per acre have been placed
upon both ranches. The colony tracts of
the Sacramento Valley are also the sub
ject of inquiry.
The sending by the Sacramento Valley
Association of a representative to San
Francisco indicates the new policy that
the counties of the interior have adopted.

Major Frank McLaughlin returned to
the city last night after an extended trip
throughout the East. Several months ago
the major left California, as his health,
was failing and he felt that the changa
would restore him. ' His trip was ong
purely of pleasure, and as a result he re-;
turns to San â¢ Francisco very much im
proved in health. He Is registered at the
Palace, where he will remain for a few
days.

NO PliAN" TO HTJBT WILIJLAM3.
Owners Will Not Befuse to Race on
His Tracks.
A report gained circulation at Tanforan
when the sale of the San Francisco
Jockey Club to the Williams interests was
verified that some of the more, prominent
Eastern owners had made an agreement
not to ship their stables to California
next season. It was further stated that
an understanding between several mem
bers of the Owners' and Trainers* Mutual
Association Indorsed the move.
Pat Dunne, a member of the executive
committee of the Owners' Association,
emphatically denied yesterday that any
such foolish action had been considered.
Dunne Is one of the most Intelligent and
sensible men racing horses in the West.
"Horsemen, as a rule, are not fools."
said Dunne yesterday. "I never heard oC
any such plan to Injure the California
Jockey Club. Owners, to begin with, can
never tell six months ahead where they
will race. The report probably grew out
of the receipt by me of several telegrams
from members of the association trying to
involve horsemen belonging to it who are
now in California in the imbroglio bo
tween the old Turf Congress and the re
cently organized Western Jockey Club
over the proposed outlaw rule issued by
the latter. I answered for myself and
others that I considered the matter es
sentially a controversy between the track
owners and Jockey clubs, which in no way
demanded action or recommendations
from the horsemen, and that they would
better attend to their own business and
keep out of all such squabbles. We have
enough troubles now without courtlns
more."
Other turfmen who denied all knowledge
of the scheme to keep horses away from
California next fall are Alex Shields,
Tommy Magee. John Carroll and "Curly"
Shields.

that he cannot enter Into a discussion
with a man of that ilk.
Truly here Is "the lie with circum
stance."
Ponlatowski claims that he Is a "real
Prince," whereas the Mayor gives him
the He by calling him a "gambler." This
is a "lie with circumstance," as It Is qual
ified by the Mayor's statement that he
cannot enter into a discussion with a man
whose business is gambling.
There now remains but one more stage
of the quarrel as defined by the Bard of
Avon. It is "the l'e direct."
Will Prince Poniatowskl give "the He
direct" to the Mayor? That is the ques
tion which Is being asked in clubdom.
The Mayor and the Prince are bound to
meet face to face. Not only are they
members of the Pacific Union Club, but
they are guests at all the principal clubs
In the city. Who can tell what will hap
pen when they meet? Is San Francisco to

to Good Standing.
MARTIN WILL BE IN DEMAND.
Crack Bider May Soon Be Bestored
If amnesty is extended by the California
Jockey Club to all ruled oft or suspended
persons a great rider will be restored to
tho saddle. Over a year ago the officials
of the track across the bay ruled Willie
Martin off the turf for life on the strength
of certain evidence they possessed. Mar
tin is one of the best-known riders in this
country, and the ruling created a sensa
tion in Eastern and Middle Western turf
circles, where the disgraced rider had
seen much service. Ever since the Incep
tion of the present racing season Martin
has resided at a downtown hotel and has
been Indefatigable in his efforts to secure
reinstatement. Now success seems within
his reach.
Time will tell whether or not Willie has
lost his cunning in tho saddle, as often
happens to be the case when a boy is kept
on the gTound for any length o f time. In
the past Martin piloted Elkwood. the Su
burban winner, the mighty Clifford and
many other star performers. If restored
to good standing. Martin will be signed
by the well-known racing firm of Burns &
â¢Waterhouse.
Joe Rose, the bookmaker, is another Im
portant personage that would be affected
by the removal of the ban. Joe was ac
cused of "laying against" Red Pirate In
a race at Oakland when ridden by "Long
shot" Conley. The horse made a wretched
showing, and. after an Investigation, Rose
was ruled oft Oakland track and the col
ored boy indefinitely suspended. Rose is
now booking at Tanforan Park.
Among the many others who would wel
come reinstatement are the following:

â¢Albert Schwartz, a fireman on the trans
port Kilpatrick, had a thrilling experience
with an ex-convict yesterday morning and
succeeded in holding him, after a desper
ato struggle for more than an hour until a
policeman appeared on the scene and
placed the thug under arrest on a charge
of robbery.
Schwartz and a companion started out
Monday night to see the sights. He had
$200 In his pockets, made up of greenbacks
and gold. About 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing tho two men were in a saloon, the ex
act location of which Schwartz does not
know, when Rebert Phillips, who was re
leased from San Quentin last April, after
serving a term for burglary, entered with
a woman.
Schwartz and his friend werÂ© shaking
dlco for drinks and Phillips Joined them.
They had several drinks together. Be
tween S and 9 o'clock Schwartz left the
saloon and found Phillips standing out
side. Phillips offered to take Schwartz to
the transport and tliey walked along sev
eral, blocks, Phillips making himself very
agreeable. Schwartz finally got tired of
walking around and as they were in a se
cluded sort of place he became suspicious
and , asked Phillips where the transport
was, as he couldsee the bay, but no ships.
"How much money have- you got in your
pockets?" asked Phillips.
Schwartz pulled out a handful of gold
and silver and Phillips struck his hand,
scattering the coin. Ho picked up two $20
gold pieces and ran. Schwartz quickly
gathered .together the rest of the coin and
started in pursuit of Phillips. He chased
him several blocks- before being: able to
overtake him. Phillips showed fight and
Schwartz was game. 'I hey exchanged sev
eral blows and finally Schwartz landed on
Phillips* Jaw and knocked him down. He
jumped on top of him and held him.
A boy came along and Schwartz gave
him a EO-cent piece to find : a policeman.
The. boy found Police Officer Sheehan on
Bay street, between Stockton and Powell
streets, and the officer accompanied him
to the place where Schwartz and Phillips
were struggling on the ground.
Phillips was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital after being booked. An examination
by Dr. Richard Armistead showed that ho
had been badly beaten and perhaps in
jured Internally.

The use of this marvelous remedy, now
spring is here, makes" all the difference
between Impure, sluggish blood and tired
nerves and a healthy, energetic condition
â between sickness and health. The incal-

spring days in making sick and even de-

attention of every judicious person who
is out of health in this spring of 1901.

compound when everything else failed.
In the light of many such public Indorse-

It is easy to see why Paine's celery com-

It has been truthfully said that the men

AS WAS to have been expected, the Bryan preas
"is lurid with denunciation of "gag rule" in thÂ»
Senate. To begin with, no rule" of closure has
been adopted in the Senate. A closure rule has been
proposd by Mr. Platt of Connecticut which will enable
a majority to get a vote on a measure when a vote is
impeded by speeches thirteen and sixteen hours in
length. The Senate may or may not adopt the closur;.
As we have explained, such summary motions as
the previous question and to lay on the table were
omitted from the Senate rules on the theory that there
should be no bar to the expression of sentiment upon
pending legislation. It was intended that the minority
should fully antagonize a majority measure, but not
that the minority should abuse its privilege by pre
venting legislation for which the majority is willing 1
to assume responsibility. :
But, whether, there be a closure or not, by what
right do the Bryanites froth about a gag rule in the
Senate? The Senate is not the fountain head and
source of government in this country. It is two re
moves away from the source at which gag rule can
be made effective in destroying our institutions. Their
source is the ballot-box. When the ballots are kept
out of it or*are dishonestly counted a blow is struck
at freedom that is effective. Such a gag rule gags
indeed. It strikes at the real vitals of the Government.
If it were not for the successful application of thi3
fatal gag by Bryan's followers two Senators from
Mississippi, two from Alabama, two from South CaW'
Una and two from North Carolina would not bV in
that body to mouth about closure. Eight Senators
will sit in the next Senate from those States because
a majority of the voters have been successfully gagged
and shut away from the ballot-box. What, is to be
said of the authors .and beneficiaries of such a ga?
law, and what of the law itself when compared to
a rule that is merely prohibitive of thirteen and six
teen hour speeches consisting mostly of wind?*
; During the next legislative and Congressional cam
paign the country will be abundantly tormented by

It is a misfortune that Morgan did liis evil worst
to prevent just the honorable consummation fore
shadowed in the British note. Otherwise the two
Cabinets.would probably have arranged honorably to
set aside theClayton-Buhver treaty and clear for the
canal a path that has been continually obstructed by
an alliance between the fool friends and the implacable
enemies of the great enterprise. '
- Recent events have made no change in our inter
national obligations. In our outside intercourse with
the Governments of the world we are under the
same decent restraints that were always upon us. Th e
red-hot jingoes might learn something from the atti
tude and conduct of Washington. -He was the suc
cessful revolutionary leader who overthrew British
power, accomplished independence and as first Presi
dent under the constitution had to enter into inter
national relations with the Government he had hu
miliated. Those relations he sustained like a states
man, without a show of prejudice or passion and
without rousing either on the part of Great Britain.
His successors in the Presidency have been mindful
of his lofty example. But- all this makes no impres
sion upon the mere politicians, who ascribe the atti
tude of Washington when-assumed by a modern Presi
dent to a cringing and subservient disposition.
This brings into view the impolicy of Morgan's
kind of Senatorial diplomacy. In his speech he criti
cized the British Government and attacked the King,
and that sort of thing is resented when it is offered
by part of the treaty-making power of this Govern
ment. It is considered in proper place in the House
and of course as necessary on the stump/ But it is no
more proper in the Senate'than it would be in thi
President or Secretary of State.
The note to that effect is said to contain evidences
that the British Government would receive in a
proper spirit of concession a proposal to discuss the
abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwcr treaty by assent
and joint action of the two Governments, while it
also contains evidence that Great Britain will noi
agree to be put in the position of yielding that point
under such fire as Morgan directs at her.
THE TREATY REJECTED.
THE British Cabinet, as was expected, has re
jected the - Hay-Pauncefote treaty on account
of the Senate amendments.

Santa Clara College has furnished for the service
of California many a noble man of that type. Through
their influence her lessons have been extended widely
throughout the world. No human means can meas
ure the extent of it, but every citizen can appreciate
something of its value to himself and to his com
munity and be thankful to those who fifty years ago
laid in Santa Clara the foundations of the college
Â¦whose jubilee finds it with such a glorious record of
accomplished good.
From the college there have gone forth men to
serve the State with usefulness in every department of
endeavor. Some among them have attained high dis
tinction and rank among the most honored of our
citizens. Not a few of them are among the illustrious
dead whose deeds will brighten the pages of history
and whose examples will live long as incentives to
aspiring youth. Yet it is not by these distinguished
graduates only that the work of the college is to be
measured. It has been said with some truth "ths
world knows nothing of its greatest men." Many a
faithful worker lives in obscurity unknown to fame
whose deeds and whose influence is as helpful as those
of any whom fame attends. Indeed the welfare of a
community is mainly dependent upon those silent and
unnoted workers, who do their work because it is a
duty and not because of any renown or glory that arc
to come from it.
If it be true, as Ruskin says, that any work of man
gams something of nobleness by being designed for
all time, then this institution ranks'among the noblest
works that have ever been done on the Pacific Coast.
It is dedicated to the service of liberal education for
all time to come, and from the past fifty years of ear
nest labor can draw auguries that the designs
of its founders will be abundantly realized from
generation to generation. The jubilee that it cele
brates now is but the record of an infancy. It is but
at the beginning of its career, and yet when measured
by the work done it might well be called venerable.
Contrasted with the history of colleges in Europe
or even with those of some of the Eastern States, the
fifty years of life which Santa Clara College has at
tained is but a brief span. In California, however, it
is accounted an old college. It is one of the institu
tions that have come down to us from the days of the
pioneers; one of the proofs that the men who cam
to this coast were not all of them mere adventurers
seeking for gold to carry back to. their homes in
other lands. The men who founded Santa Clara Col
lege and those who gave to it the support that in
creased its usefulness were something more than self
seekers. They were not men who build for to-day
only, but for all time. They gave freely of their
energy, their labors, their thoughts and their treasure
for the generations of the future.
ALL Californians will find something to inte-est
them in the celebration of the jubilee of Santa
Clara College. The history of the college
begins virtually at the same time with the history of
the commonwealth as z State of the American Union.
From the very first it has been one of the most
potent intellectual and moral forces that tend to the
upbuilding of California life, and the record of what
it has accomplished is one that can be. read with
pride and with thankfulness by every patriot.
SANTA CLARA COLLEGE.
Opportunity to Eslp the Negro.
Mrs. Washington 13, I am sure, ready to
further this work among Southern colored
women with her utmost efforts: she has
some capable and interested workers who
will stand back of her;, more can be en
listed and back of them stretches a field
for endeavor which . is boundless. The
white club women of - the South will aid
nnd encourage the movement; the sinews
of war are the one thing needful; for lack
of money the movement goes slowly. For
these who seek a' paying investment I
The mothers will learn as much as the
children, and they need It just as sadly
There will be a Constant Interplay between
the two, and the homes will stand a dual
chnnce of being affected by the moral life
of the kindergarten.
The fourth point of interest In the plan
of the new movement presents itself In the
immense interactionary - value of tha
mothers* club and the kindergartens. .
The white people of the South have
given the negro his grammar school edu
cation, a hundred millions of it; the white
people of the North have given him hun
dicds of thousands of dollars worth of
higher education; the negro himself has
helped earnestly, and for. the first time. In
securing a considerable measure of indus
trial education, and yet. with all these
provisions, education- is not accomplish
ing for tho negro what It should. Why?
Because none of it begins soon enough. The
very little children must be reached with
moral suggestion. Many are lost as citi
zens before they reach the public schools,
and there the effort is to train the Intellect,
not to form character. The demand for
infant education is more peremptory with
th& negro than with the whites, because
his need of character building and, of
moral suggestion is so much greater, and
because his home influences retard moral
advancement. The klndergarden, widely
diffused and especially adapted. Is the
foundation upon which negro education of
the future" must rest. That Its Inaugura
tion has been left for women Is a signi
ficant sijrn of the times.
The second point of interest in the phe
nomenon before us Is that the colored
women who are inaugurating thl3 work
have, in so doing, been from-the begin
ning in close touch with friends
among the white women of the South, who
stand at the very head of the club move
ment of the United States. In every case
where organization among the colored
women of a town has been effected the
oiganizer has gone to that town armed
with letters from Southern club women
to other Southern club women, and In
every Instance aid. advice, encouragement
and indorsement have been gladly given.
The plan of the work for the future in
cludes the Idea that the club of white
women all over the South shall stand back
of this work of colored women, and by
every possible means aid and further it.
The Atlanta Women's Club has. by re
quest of tne colored women, appointed a
committee which will be at their ser
vice for advice and encouragement; the
Georgia State Federation will use the in
fluence of its forty-seven clubs to promote
the work. Other Southern States will
gladly follow Georgia's lead. Thus South
ern club women are embracing heartily
the opportunity to give all possible aid
and encouragement to the colored women.
This aid the latter In the best possible
spirit gladly accept.^
In lhe third place the special work which
this movement proposes is the one thing
needful to till the gap that all previous
efforts have left in the system of negro
education. Â¦ .
White Women Lend Their Aid.
It is a movement of negroes for negroes.
In this respect it is unique. Nearly every
movement which has been inaugurated
for the negro has come from the outside
and has been offered to him as a gift.
Even when he has been asked to help in
It the plan, at least, has come from with
out. In this case, although white women
have given advice and substantial aid, the
movement\i3 and will continue to be the
work of colored women. Its leaders feel
the Importance of this, and while they
know they must have ~nancial aid. they
are convinced that every colored woman
in the South should contribute of her in
dividual substance to the work If the best
results are to be obtained. There can be
little doubt that they have struck bedrock
here; the condition of the negro problem
to-day hinges largely upon the fact that
the negro has had too much done for him.
Both sections by giving him too many
things before he had earned them have
festered, Instead of removing, his Irre
sponsibility. The Southern States, by the
expendituae of the immense sum of $100,
000,000, have removed 50 per cent of the
race from Illiteracy, and the North, by
the creation and maintenance of many in
stitutions for the higher education, has
taught the negro many things. And yet,
If all these sums and all the benefits they
have brought could have come as the re
sult of Bome effort on the part of the ne
gro himself, I can but believe that other
and more valuable racial results would
have accrued, of which â¢all Interested are
now feeling the lack. However, all these
things are already done or not done: it is
idle to look back except as looking back
may help us In going forward. We should
be wiser than our past and by this light
special significance lies in the fact that
this movement of Southern colored wo
men is inaugurated by them for their own
race and will be thus carried .on.
The movement thus outlined presents
several features which command special
interest and promise well for its outcome.
Thus will be practically launched the
most important measure yet inaugurated
in behalf of the negro race. With sober
ness and due consideration I am con
vinced the granting of political suffrage
and the founding of mighty universities
in its behalf never meant half so much
to the race as will this initial step, where
by Its women move forward In honest,
genuine, practical effort to help them
selves through their children. i*or the
first time the vital springs of motive in
the race itself are being touched: the con
sequent effort and its results will be gen
uine.
Vast Importance of the Work.
The president was empowered to appoint
the following representatives: (1) A gen
eral organizer for the entire South, who
shall systematically canvass for the for
mation of mothers' clubs and kindergar
tens. (2) A State organizer for each of
the Southern States, who shall work in
her local field under the general organ
izer. (3) A general representative of the
kindergarten work of the Southern Fed
eration of Colored "Women's Clubs, whose
duty it shall be to travel in its interest
and secure funds which shall be necessary
to the success of the work.
Southern Federation, was, therefore,
warmly confirmed and the members con
secrated themselves anew to its further
ance. .
Mrs. Booker Washington.
That question will have' to be considered in con
nection with the general plan of upbuilding the Amer
ican merchant marine. So long as our Government
leaves our ocean carrying; trade in the hands of for
eigners and does nothing to promote American ship
ping interests, we can hardly discuss fruit steamers
as a practical question. In the end, however, the ship,
ping. bill will certainly be enacted, and we shall then
Ik- able to meet the Canadians or any one else on
equal terms.
The Consul directs attention to the fact that the
Canadians have ..established a line of steamers de
signed mainly for carrying fruit to Europe, and says:
"Is it, not worth while for American fruit-grower 1 :
to consider the advantages reaped by the Canadians
through the institution <of this new line of ocean fruit
vessels, to consolidate their interests, and^o meet the
eminently practical features of this new competition?"
With reports of that nature coming from Francs
itself it is likely the wine consumers of our Eastern
States will learn at last that California wine is worth
as much under its own label as under a French label,
and we shall then have a home market that will ma
terially improve the conditions of the industry.,
The English report, coming from S. C. McFarland,
Consul. at Nottingham, says; "Fruit from the vast
orchards of Oregon and California has flooded Lon
don and the large provincial towns. The imports of
the season have thus far been phenomenal both in
quality and in quantity." A leading fruit merchant is
quoted as saying: "The immense crop of California
and Oregon apples will be of great advantage to con
sumers, who will be able to purchase fine fruit at mod
erate prices. * * * I n other kinds of fruit, such
as plums and oranges, the California trade is growing
vyith. great rapidity."
The report from France comes from John C.
Covert, Consul at Lyons, and deals with
Wine Production in 1900." After pointing out that
the wine production of France for that year was
1,721,000,000 gallons, "a yield that has only been ex
ceeded three times during the past century," he goes
on to say that the Government is trying to augment
the consumption of French wine by making it cheapsr,
and to that end has already reduced the wine tax and
will probably repeal it altogether. Then he adds.
"Wine is now produced, more cheaply in California
than in France. -TJie efforts to introduce French wint
into Japan have allVen ineffectual on account of Cali
fornia competition, the Japanese declaring that they
could buy wine cheaper and of as good a quality in
San Francisco as in France."

our wines and fruits are making their way in the for

little satisfaction. They show that the excellence of

give ground for expecting an increased demand with
an increased profit in the near future.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The encouraging results of the one year
of; experimental work-- convinced the col
ored women of the society and their white
friends 'even: more; deeply than before of
the value and necessity of Iheiwork. -Its
adoption, as tha anec.lal endeavor of ithe
. But' !'how. shall they hear, without a
preacher?" How follow without a leader?
Tothis point; then; of securing systema
tized leadership for colored women in es
tablishing and 'maintaining kindergarten
work': the I Southern | Federation of Colored
Women's* Clubs devoted ' special attention
at the recent meeting in Atlanta.
That the colored women of the South
are ready and anxious to undertake this
work for the children of their race is evi
denced by the fact that in every town
where, the matter has been broached
women in plenty have been 'found ready
and willing to form mothers' clubs, which
are. in turn, to inaugurate kindergartens.
Such beginnings for the work\ have been
made in Atlanta, Montgomery, Charles
ton. Macon, Rome and Barnesville; Ga.
That, these places have been organized is
due solely to the fact that an .organizer
was able by personal effort to make her
way ; there. Hundreds: of other Southern
towns teem witn Just as good material for
the' work and are Just as ripe for organi
zation. Only ihe leader Is needed. With
money : enough to .spread such leadership,
a, few years would see thousands' of col
ored women throughout ; the : Southern
States in organization . for the purpose > of
pocuring early training for their children.
Such effort would prove : the most ef
iectual means < f moral and ethical devel
opment for the women themselves. . Â¦
Randy Response to tha Suggestion.
The clubwomen of Â«the South became
deeply interested in the idea and were not
long in perceiving that for their section
the kindergarten work as a method of so
cial quarantino must begin. with the ne
gro: since he furnishes the substratum of
our social structure he must be reached
lirst. and that 'n a way which the schools
were failing to do. Through 1 the club
women a few or the colored women of the
South became aroused to the paramount
necessity of the kindergarten movement
among their people. Chief among these
was Mrs. Cary. who after a year or two
of local agitation in connection with some
leading Southern clubwomen gladly seized
the opportunity of the Montgomery meet
ing to propose that the Southern clubs
of colored women should adopt as their
special line of work the promotion of the
kindergarten idea among their people.
She had enthusiastic backing from Mrs.
\vashington, who is an ardent advocate
of the social value of the kindergarten
airs. Cary was made chairman of the
movement for the first year, which has
Just closed. The society was too young
and unformed to be possessed of funds,
and so the work has been slow, depending
upon happy accidents which might fur
nish transportation here or there Even
these unsystematlzed efforts have, how
ever, borne sufficient fruit to convince
those interested that the harvest genu
inely Is great.
A few delegates from various parts of
the South met in Montgomery In Decem
ber, W$, and formed a provisional organi
zation, with Mrs. Washington as presi
dent and Mrs. Alice Cary of Atlanta as
secretary. Mrs. Cary was a warm advo
cate of a Southern organization, knowing
as she did the crying need for concen
trated effort among the colored people of
the Southern States. Though a teacher
by profession, for years she had devoted
her leisure time and her private means to
rescue work in the slums of Atlanta and
especially in the prison camps and chain
gangs. Through such experiences as she
met there the moral and social needs of
her people had eaten into her heart, and
ehe looked eagerly for the next step for
ward. This step, she believes, lies in the
universal kindergarten for the negro.
Some years since Horace Fletcher of
New York was In Atlanta as the guest of
Mrs. Rebecca Douglas Lowe and the
Women's Club. He came to urge the es
tablishment in large numbers of slum kin
dergartens as a method of social quaran
tine.
Beginning a Great Movement.
For reasons like these many of us feel
the vital necessity for organization among
those women who are the wives and moth
ers of the more than 8,000,000 persons who
constitute the negro race. Moral uplift, a
higher standard of character, a purer and
loftier race Ideal," with a corresponding
raising of the plane of practical lifeâ these
are the things of which the negro stands
so much in need and no amount of effort
from without will bring them to him. Mis
sionaries may preach and schools and col
leges may teach, but until the propaganda
of a higher standard of living is taken, up
and pushed by the people themselves we
shall Bee little fruit from great labor. In
the -light -of such reflection, very special
interest attaches to a meeting whicn has
recently convened in Atlanta, Ga., and
which marks the most decisive movement
yet instituted for aggressive work
among negro women and through them
tor their race.- On December 27 and 23 the
bouthern Federation of Colored Women's
Clubs held its first annual convention In
Atlanta; at this meeting its existence was
confirmed and Its plans and methods Â¦ of
work more fully outlined than had been
possible at the Initial meeting in Mont
gomery the previous December. Its pres
ident. Mrs. Booker Washington, of Tus
kegee. Is a devoted member and earnest
upholder of the National Federation of
Colored Women's Clubs, but living, aS she
does, in the heart of the "black belt," she
could see how different were the needs
and present possibilities of the millions of
negroes in the South from those of the
scattered colored population of all the oth
er States in the Union. These needs of
the Southern colored women are not only
different but a thousand times more press
ing, and circumstances prevent them from
depending upon a far-off organization for
help or inspiration. A few earnest spirits
urged upon Mrs. Washington the forma
tion of a small organization, which, while
working in full accord with the national
federation, should afford an arena and all
opportunity for the great mass of colored
women who are, of course, congested in
the South. Mrs. Washington could not re
sist such arguments; she assumed the
burden and threw herself Into the move
ment which has since taken form as the
Southern Federation of Colored Women's
Clubs.
The enlarged vision, the raised Ideal,
cannot bo handed down from a great
height and- swallowed whole by a waiting
substratum. Aspiration and conception
must be kindled and quickened within the
hearts and minds of some individuals of
every class, and they will ignite the
whole.
Negro Women's Work for the Race.
In organization is not only strength, but
development, and through It nearly all the
â¢women of the civilized world are coming
into some sort of realization of their true
place and power as special pleaders for
th6 higher ethical ideal and representa
tives of the spiritual values of life as off
set against the material, j From women
must come any special advance in this
struggle for "sweetness and light" in the
individual or national life of our people;
their efforts must leaven. the whole lump
of our social organism. To this end not
some but all the women must be enlisted;
each class in our complex social organi3m
can bo reached only by the women of that
claps.
The foremost concrete agency through
which this diffused Influence of-woman is
being attained Is the organized life Into
which women of all creeds, classes and de
grees are being- drawn.
That the twentieth is to be the woman's
century means not alone that in it women
arc to have more liberty or more "rights."
They will have these, too, but, above all,
they will be possessed of a wider responsi
bility through which their Influence for a
higher standard of morals and ideals will
be extended beyond the home to the State
in its every department.

V.â WOMEN'S CLUBS AND THE NEGEO PROBLEM.
ATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS.
By IMrs. Jolm. KZ. Ottley.
MEMBER; OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMITTEE OF THE GENERAL FEDER-
What American Women Are Doing to Up
lift the Golored Race and Solve
the Negro Problem.
Prepared by Experts and Specialists for
: The San â¢ Francisco Call
PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
WE have been glad to note every instance of re
bellion among the clergy against the conduct
of the so-called Christian nations in China.
The different branches of the Christian church have
too readily assumed that if China were cut and carved
to suit the commercial greed of the Western powers
iÂ« would be as easy to fasten Christianity upon the
pieces as it is to paste circus bills on the ruins of a
house that has been gutted by fire. .
This feeling has led to a policy either of approba
tion or silence on the part of the clergy as to the
doings which have made the path of the Christians in
China scarlet with the blood of the people. We have
never seen any reason to anticipate that the Chinese
people could be soundly converted by the crimes com
mitted among them in the name of the faith they are
2sked to embrace. Mahometanism was a religion of
the sword. It spread by war from the Pyrenees to
Cashmere. But its method was different from the
slaughter and thieving that have attended the Chris
tian progress in China. If a city or a kingdom would
acknowledge one God and accept the son of Abdal
lah as his Prophet the captains of the Caliphs coun
termarched their armies and left the country inde
pendent and undisturbed in any of its civil institu
tions. The Mahometan soldier was abstinent, self
controlled and disciplined. In religion he was as
fanatical as the most pronounced Christian mission
ary, but as a man and a soldier he lived strictly up to
the ideals of his faith.
It is needless to say that the Christian armies in
China have not carried the cross there, and that their
conduct has been more savage, bestial, inhuman and
awful than has ever characterized the warfare of wild
and primitive man. That seems a hard judgment, but
its truth rests upon the unimpeachable testimony of
men like Sir Robert Hart and Dr. Dillon.
Recently the Rev. Dr. Eaton of New York, in his
Sunday sermon, joined Bishop Potter and Cardinal
Vaughan in denouncing the Christian policy and con
duct in China. Dr. Eaton said:
w If it be necessary to convert China at the cannon's
mouth and by the bloody sword, at the behest of
the spirit of commercialism and greed, then I say
a thousand times rather would I have Confucius
rule China than Jesus. War is not Christian. I do
not say that war is not sometimes necessary, but .1 do
say it is always unchristian. The war in China was
one which we were perhaps compelled to fight, but it
is one that does not reflect any credit on Chris
"We cannot open ports in the name of Jesus. The
history of the Christian nations in China during the
last year has been a disgrace to Christianity. It has
been a history of murder, rapine and rape, in the
name of Christianity, in the name of the Golden
Rule.
"If China can only be christianized by dismem
berment and exploitation, then far better that thi
Chinese should remain followers of Confucius, who
was a firm believer la equity and justice and taught
tc that effect. .
"May some almighty power keep back our hands
from the throat of China. God grant that China may
be won for Christianity, but God grant also that
China may have the courage and the power to resist
until the Christian nations have learned the true les
sons of Christianity.
"There are abundant signs now that if we do not
desist from our course the submissive yellow race will
rise in its might and sweep from the earth a Chris
tianity which has become the synonym of cruel
commercial greed."
Those words are true and brave words. We hope
soon to have occasion to add to the honor list many
more American clergymen.
It is the current custom to berate Russia for her
reprehensible greed in Manchuria. Her policy from
the view-point of. honesty and honor is highly crim
inal. But why is such a policy possible? Why does
a great nation pursue a course which stains her honor
and degrades her civilization?
It is because other nations have never resisted sim
ilar temptations under similar circumstances, and,
there is no evidence that they will resist them now.
There being no honor among thieves of that kind,
Russia is simply improving her opportunity and
rraking the most of her position, which happens to
be more favorable for land stealing than that of her
rivals. China is not blind to the situation, and is no
doubt willing to give Manchuria to "Adam Zad, the
Bear," provided Adam will help' her save the rest of
her territory from theft by the other beasts of prey
that are murdering and robbing her people. ,
No wonder that Bishop Potter declares that in the
cause celebre of China against the Christian world
he appears as couns:l for China. And we are glad
to enroll Rev. Dr. Eaton as his associate counsel.

The Yosemite Valley season openfe on

Company will on that day place sleeping
cars on the run between Raymond and
this city, and also between 1ms Angeles

claim that from present indications more
vlBitors will journey to the Yosemite Val
ley this year than during any previous
season.
I trust that, whtn the cars ordered and In
process . of construction are In service, there
will be no further cause of complaint on the
part of the shippers.
Hays addressed his answer to the Rail
road Commissioners, and Jn the letter he
gives his views on the matter. He says
he Is aware of the fact that there are not
enough oil cars to handle the product, but
â¢that he sees no reason why the oil busi
ness should he at a standstill and the
wells shut down for lack of cars. Hays
suggests that ;none tanks should be erect
ed along the railroad tracks. With these
tanks adjacent to them it should not be
necessary for the wells to be closed down.
In his letter - Hays also says that the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company fully
realizes the value of thla new industry
and that oik cars are being procured as
fast as possible. He says that 500 new oil
tank cars are being constructed as rap
idly as possible and that the delivering of
them will be commenced April 1. In con

however, and Eschen whipped up his
horse and followed. He broke the whip
into small pieces over the robber, but the
latter doubled Into some lumber piles near
Fremont-strret whjrf and managed to es
cape. The police are en his track, as he
is a well-known thief.
Dupleix Overdue From Newcastle and
Underwriters Are Anxious.
The French bark Dupleix Is now out 103
days from Newcastle. Aus.. and yesterday
the underwriters offered 20 per cent to re
insure hull and cargo. No storms have
been reported, but the Star of Bengal,
which arrived at Honolulu on March 6,
had her coal cargo heated, and 170 tons
of the black diamonds had to be jetti
soned.
The ship Duchalburn sailed from Xew
castle November 9 last, the Drunmuir on
December 18. the Hougomont on Decem
ber 28. the Star of Bengal on January 6
and the Marguerite Dollfus from Mel
bourne. Aus., on January 18. while the
Dupleix sailed on December 6, 1&00. The
Duchalburn made the run to San Francis
co In sixty-seven days, the Drunmutr in
ninety-one, the Hougomont In seventy
four, the Star of Bengal to Honolulu in
fifty-nine and the Dollfus from Melbourne
to San Francisco In forty-seven days. All
these vessels report variable winds, but
only one. the Duchalburn, encountered
any heavy weather.
In sympathy with the Dupleix. the rate
on the John McDonald took another jump
yesterday. She also has a coal cargo, and
the rate Is now 55 per cent, while the
Khorasan. out 223 days from Tampa for
Yokohama, has gone from SO to 40 per

Tries to "Loot the W. H. Macey.
A bold Eneak thief went aboard the ship
W. II. Macey, lyingf at Main - street
wharf, yesterday, and -was proceeding to
loot the cabin when he was discovered.
lie managed to get on deck and rushed
down the gangway, with a cry of "stop
th!ef following him. Captain Eschen of
Kschen & Minor was sitting in his buggv
clcse to the gangway and tried to knock
the robber down with the butt end of
his whip. The man rot away on the run.
ALL, the shipowners along the coast
are getting ready for the sum
mer rush of gold hunters to the
Arctic. Steamships will be run
direct from every port on the
roa$t between St. Michael and Cape Tork,
and there will be another rush to be first
[n the same as there was last year. Seat
tie has chartered a great number of ves
sels In San Francisco, and there Is great
rivalry to have the first steamship to ar
rive at Nome hail from Puset Sound. -'Â« Â¦.Â¦:
Amonsr the first vessels to get awray
from here will be the Pacific Steam
Whaling Compsny's Jeanle and Thrasher.
Both steamships will leave on April 22
r^nd should reach Nome about May 23.
Wry few, if cnv, vessels outside of the
whalins fleet will venture into rtie ice as
rarly as this. Both the Jeanie and Thrash
t t c&s po where an ordinary steel or iron
\fSF*-l dare not venture. Both of them
are shcatiTc-d and strengthened, Â¦while a
steel shoe is provided for "buckine the
he."
The first vessel to arrive at Nome last
year was the steam whaler Alexander,
and five hours after her the Jeanie cast
anchor. Tl.is was on May 23, 1H00. and
three days later the Thrasher arived.
1'rartiraliy all the accommodation on the
JÂ«ar.le hus been taken and there are
f nough applications on hand to fill the
Thrasher twice over. The Thrasher goes
on the drydock to-day to be overhauled
and fitted out. and the Jeanie will be sim
ilarly treated when she gets back from
the north.
Kesides these vessels the whaling com
pany will send out the Valencia on May
24. the Pacific Coast Steamship Company
will send the Senator and several others,
the Alaska Commercial Company will
rend the St. Paul. Portland and Bertha,
the Kimball Steamship Company will send
at least four modern vessels, Charles Nel
pcn will send the Centennial. Charles Nel
son. Ruth and several others, while three
or four of the Mall Company's boats have
been chartered to outside parties for the
run north. Next month will see the be
ginning of another rush to the frozen

(fl-~t.s business is noted in Jobbing quantities at
from Sc to BHfC. according to holder and descrip
tion of fruit. No trade of consequence is noted
In T<*-S0s or 80-$0e. and the movement In 90-IOQb
Is generally trifling in character. From ad
vices received by wire from the coast to-day
the impression prevails that notwithstanding
ti.e purchase of the outside holdings by the
Â¦fFociation that organization will carry
over into next season from 21.00 to 2700 car
leads of prunes. This view is based on the
prospective light consuming season between
now and the next harvest, and the belief that
a eufficieiu quantity of etock to supply a great
portion of the demand during that period Is
etlll available In distributing channels.
"In raisins the market remains somewhat dull
â¢nd easy. The light consuming demand has
had a tendency toward weakening the views of

In S-crown Is reported at 6c. Mall orders gen

buying largely from hand to mouth. A moder
ate trade is noted In 6eeded with quotations
unchanged. In other descriptions of California
and imported raisins the market shows no un
usual or active features. In currants the spot
market lacks animation and we hear of no Im
portant movement in any description.
"Apricots continue quiet. Peaches ehow
a little movement, generally on the cheaper

The Weather and Crops.
thÂ« movement of prices all day. In the last
hour after prices had very generally touched
the top limit at about 2 o'clock the profes
sional traders turned to the bear side of the
market, owing to the heavy realizing selling
that showed all through the list and offered
prices down boldly, taking the market away
from the bulls and uncovering some stop-loss
orders where- speculative activity had been un
duly extended on Insufficient security. The
result was a tumbling of prices that looked
for a, time like demoralization on the part of
the bulls. The reaction from best prices In
the most prominent of the strong stocks ran
up from 1 to 2H and quite a number of stocks
which had not been marked up during the
day fell below last night's level. There was
a momentary rally on covering by the room
shorts, but profit-taking was renewed and
many stocks closed at the low point of the
reaction. The steel utocks were a conspicuous
exception. They held firm at each successive
advance all day and In the closing flurry
mounted buoyantly In face of the active selling
elsewhere. The time fixed for the deposit of
thes>e stocks in assent to the terms of the
steel merger expires to-morrow and to-day's
buoyancy In the stocks gives rise to the sup
position that the plan will promptly be de
clared operative. This supposition was without
official confirmation. There was an excited
Fpeculation in the United States Steel stocks

emphatic denials from President J. J. Hill of
a purchase or a plan to purchase control. The

NEW YORK, March 19.â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
American stocks monopolized all the attention
In the stock markets here to-day. Otherwise
business was quiet, though prices were very
Irregular. General trading was checked at the
outset by the rumor that Von Waldersee's in
tervention In the dispute with the Russians at
Tientsin had proved abortive. Then came a
report which said that the whole matter had
been amicably settled. This helped home busi
ness, but the market ended with a -depressed
tone caused by a cable dispatch Baying that
Botha had refused finally General Kitchener's
terms. The American department was busy,
with buoyant prices throughout the whole ses
sion. There was very large professional deal-
Ing, but the public is nervous after the long
rise to dabble at this level. New York bought
heavily of Eries. which London sold readily.
.There is an absurd story current that the men
on the miners" executive committee have been
speculating with the miners' funds and that
J. P. Morgan finding them short on Erie Issues

OAKLAND. March 19.â "Municipal
Improvements" was the topic of
discussion to-night before the
Men's League of the First Congre
gational Church. Mayor Phelan of
San Francisco, Mayor Snow of Oakland
and President Hutchinson of the Califor
nia Conference of Municipalities being
the speakers. - .
The meeting, which was largely attend
ed, was presided over by Giles H. Gray,
who introduced the speakers of the even
ing. The first address was by Mayor Phe
lan. who said:
The chairman of your outlook committee In
noting recent felicitous political events did not
mention the fact that the Legislature hns ad
journed. Well. In city government, the Legis
lature never adjourns.
The condition of American municipalities, ot
which It were trite to pay that they are rap-
Idly becoming the dominant, factors of the re
public. Is such as to onus; man}' economists , to
grow pessimistic They denounce the failure
of democratic institutions, of universal suff
rage, and predict the formation of an empire,
so that the Importance of the topic before you
to-night calls for no emphasis from me. -
I take It that what you want from me Is an
account of what we In San Francisco hayo
done in tlie way of Improving municipal condi
tions. Our greatest advance hns been the
adoption of the new charter, which has rcme-?
died the most crying abuses in our city gov
ernment.
Attacks Legal Profession. '
In San Francisco we had to combat the most
notorious boss rule existing In the country. It
was firmly Intrenched behind- the spoils sys
tem, legislative interference in municipal af
fairs and the saloon vote, which ' 1? ' always
Inimical to good government. We have wrested
the government from the spoilsmen and our
city offices are to-day practically clean. - Un
der the provisions of our civil service regula
tions we hope to extend the merit system to
every -position pa the city's payroll. - This
movement is in charge of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, a body of leading citizens, from ! which
lawyers are barred. The lawyers are by the
very nature of their profession willing to ham
per and oppose the efforts to secure decent
government If any one In whose interests it is
to do so will hire them for that purpose.
Our Civil Service Commission was -tied up
and enjoined from .holding examinations cal
culated to *le\-ate the civil service by Judge.
Oarber. We had I to hire another lawyer to
fight him and shall have to. pay him. well to
do it. Our new charter has worked bo well
that I have yet to receive a single complaint
against any. city official from any reputable
source. The papers' are always attacking
them, but the papers have' little weight." The
people have found, out that they are Irrespon
sible and venal. Three of themâ the Call,
Chronicle and Postâ fought the new . charter.
They are all of them fighting our Civil. Ser
vice Commission. . They * attaok - - at random
whom they will and their victims- have prac
tically no recourse. The. people have. learnel
that the policy of a paper Is dictated v by : the
man that owns the presses and' not , by any
motive for the public wea!.\
The Newspapers Again.
Take- the gambling evil. The papers have
made a great row about Chinese gambling,
and In the same Issues, they, published the
drawings' of the Honduras lottery, to do which
The Call, Chronicle and Examiner took a bribe
of $10,000 each. There is no State law here to
prohibit this lottery business. Even the be
nighted State of -Nevada would -not receive
them, but their drawings are continually pub
lished in the Ban .Francisco papers. These
papers are to corrupt that they support the
racetracks. California alone of all the States
la silent on this question. We , can * ret no
Btate law on this evil because the Legislature
Is dominated -.-by - the Emeryville â¢ track man
agement, bo that San Francisco must: enact
her own laws .to regulate racetrack gambling,
the greatest evil of Its kind, it she have any
such laws. Yet on this s question the papers
follow the policy that pays them, with no con
sideration for public welfare. .

against Thomas F. Hemmenway for

of the evidence was put in yesterday.
The case will be argued this morning and
submitted to the jury.
When the case was called .yesterday
morning Mrs. Barnes was recalled and
concluded her testimony. The defense
then opened. Anna Frledberg was called
to the stand. She testified that she had
eeen Mrs. Barnes act in a manner not
altcpether ladylike. She was corroborated
by Frank S. Cleland.
Hemmenway finally took the stand on
his own behalf. Hi admitted nls engage
ment to Mrs. Barnes and admitted that
she had procured a divorce from her
former husband at his instance. He de
nied, however, that he had ever Intended
to deceive her, asserting that his reason

I regret to state that the all powerful branch
of our city government, the City Council ha*
not shown Itself competent to decide, with all
the help It has received from organized citi
zens. Just what â¢ the city shall do first. I
think the City Council needs expert help In
many things : the help of experts of nigh
standing. As matters stand at present the city
ns. a whole has yet to recognize & need for
any one municipal i Improvementâ a ; need so
pressing that It must be met. . When that time
comes the vote will be found In favor of that
one thing.'. In the meantime education must
go on. It Is hard to ; be patient with the
selfishness of . our neighbors or with perverse
Ignorance;, but no man can allow himself to
become discouraged or sore or sour. The prob
lem of the new centurr Is- how; men shall
live together In cities. It must be solved by
men like ourselves and neighbors, or democra

Oakland has come at last to know, I think,

about In our city for more than a decade.
The local - situation in relation to municipal
Improvements, upon which I am requested to
speak, has ; not greatly changed In thlÂ« dtjr

Situation Not Greatly Changed.
The votor3 ot this city have most emphati
cally declared their disapproval of the at
tempt that was made by office seekers to make
a pollticat machine of this city government.
It Is to be hoped that the sacrifice which has
been already made Is enough to satisfy every
man who would rule or ruin. But If such will
pursue this policy further then It becomes
the duty of a second administration to de
termine for Itself the relative value of these
things. , Â» . .
this peculiarity, that only one side of the
game has been played. In the outset of the
present administration, the Mayor was called
upon to decide whether he would be a tool In
the hands of two or three ambitious men to
punish .their political enemies and to reward
their friends; to be us*>d to reorganize upon
political partisan lines the departments of the
city; to place these departments at the beck
of a would-be Congressman, a Governor and
a county Supervisorâ whether he would forsake
the first' principles of good municipal govern
ment or let the city, stand Â¦ still for two more
years â this he was railed upon to decide.'
Success upon a false basis is but temporary.
Victory through the violation of a vital prin
ciple Is dearly bought. Counting: all the cost,
the decision was made in favor of the princi
ple; And now at the close of the two years'
time, with a little knowledge of the pains of
martyrdom. 'I am glad that the decision was
so made. It is now possible to hand down to
the new administration a departmental govern

The Chinaman is the principal type of Ori
ental civilization. He is phlegmatic and slug
gish. Time is no object with him. He takes
things as ' they come and never seems to be in
a hurry. How different Is the American, the
highest type of Occidental civilization'. He Is
nervous and energetic. He acts on the prin
ciple that "time Is money." and accordingly
is Impatient of restraint and always on a rush.
When the* old Oriental civilization meets, the
new Occidental civilization It Is to be expected
that there will be a clash. Which will havfe to
give way to the other Is by no mean certain,
for" "the race is not to the swift nor the battle
to the strons."
There has lately been a great deal of news
paper talk about civilizing China. I give credit
to those people who advocate such a course for
their good intention, but its desirability, to
say nothing of its difficulty. Â¦ should not be
overlooked. Ch'na has already a civilization
of her own. It 2Â» the growth of time. IÂ»ng
before the ancestors of the people of the west
ceased to be naked savages and emerged from
the primeval forests of Central Europe, the
Chinese had known the use of the compass
and the art of printing. Now for the people
of the west to turn around and then ask the
Chinese to put away their old civilization is
rather novel. The people of the west may
know more than the Chinese about the build
ing of railroads, the floating of foreign loans,
the combination of capital, the development of
resources and the like. All tbls Is granted.
As to Religion and Interference.
But the Chinese naturally feel that they are
in a better position to Judge what Is best for
their own Interest and welfare than any out
sider can be. Therefore, any attempt to Im
pose upon them any reform or religion they
do not feel the need of Is apt to create trou
ble. The use of force is especially to be dep
recated, as this serves only to inflame their
passions and rouse their resentment and oppo
sition. But on the other hand, much can be
accomplished by exercising tact and discretion
and, above all, by giving due consideration to
their sentiments and prejudices.
If the people of the west would study the
civilization of China Instead of trying to pull
!t down they will save themselves a great
deal of trouble. They will find, that the Chi
nese are not addicted to "ways that are dark
and tricks that are vain." as they are repre
sented to be by an. American poet. They wll!
find that China, old as she Is. still exhibits all
the strength and vigor of full maturity. They
will find that' the civilization that has stood
the test of forty centuries Is far from being
effete. They will find that the proper course
to be pursued in putting China on the road to
prosperity Is not : to shake the foundations of
her social and political fabric, but to allow her
to incorporate such elements of western civ
ilization as she can assimilate. On the other
. hand. China must keep u? with the tlmos In
the onward march of progress. To this end It
Is necessary for her to take lessons from the
western world. But she need not be a servile
Imitator. Her requirements are . peculiar to
her position among nations and to the growth
Of her natural life.

Oriental Civilization.
Xature has biased the country with every
variety of soil and climate, so that the peo
ple have never been obliged to look to other
countries for the supply of their wants. They
have been able to live within themselves with
out difficulty and to get alonf? without having
to do with outside nations. Their long seclu
sion has been not only a matter of necessity,
but also a matter of choice, i
True It is that China's isolation has tended
to strengthen the nation's character and rive
it a marked individuality, but this has not
been gained without great losses. The most
serious is that the nation has not been able
to profit by the trials, experiences and achieve
ments of the rest of the world. This Is es
pecially true with t-clentific knowledge and
mechanical inventions. It must be admitted
that to-day China is centuries behind the age
in her knowledge of chemistry, electricity,
steam navigation, rapid transit and other arts
and sciences. AH these things she must learn
from other nations before she can hope to
put herself abreast of the times.
But does civilization consist of railroad"
telegraphs, electric lights, battleships, rapid
firing runs, magazine rifles and a thousand
and one things which are often regarded as
a necessity for a progressive nation? This
vrculd .be a very narrow Interpretation of the
vrord. Civilization has. I believe, a broader
meaning, with intelligence. order, morality
and refinement for Its essential elements. Such
a civilization China undoubtedly hasâ a civilis
ation different, to be sure, from that of the
West, but a civilization nevertheless. In other
words, civilization is the elevation a nation
l.as reached in its progress from a lower to a
Mgher state of society. It Is to be expected
that the civilization attained by China should
be different from that attained by the nations
of the West, by reason of their difference In
national development. Chinese ways are not
necessarily bad because they often seem
strange to Western eyes. It is merely a ques
tion whether one is accustomed to them or
not.

The convicts are allowed to talK while
at work in the mino. as it would hardly
be possible to carry on the work without
speaking. The guards never go Into the
mlr.fP with firearms on account of the
danger of an insurrection below the sur
face. Thoy carry clubs so that in the
event of an outbreak by the convicts and
the loss of their arms the work of over
powrring the convicts would not be so
great.
When near the bottom of the pit a
heavy fusillade was opened, the shots be
frtff fired toward the top of the shaft.
This took the convicts by surprise and
thinking the s*h<us w<re Intended for them
they hastily fled. lra - ins the guards, who
were soon joined by their comrades, after
which they were tÂ»rs;l to tne top. The
armed jruards then started after the con
victs and soon had tlie ringleaders under
Erjos^t when the otliirs ga}~e In. .and sur
rendered. Then thr \\ork of taking them
to the surface began and before morning
the convicts were egaln behind the bars
of Their colls.
The insurrection was brought to a close
at 11:30 to-night and the mutinous con
victs were placed in their cells as fa.=t
bs they could be brought to the surface.
The imprisoned guards have been re-
Jeafed and are apafh ancve the surface.
Shortly after r.itrtufall ttxe Warden ancl
every available officfr path^red around
the mouth of the mine, each man heavily
armed. Hunper began to tell upon the
mutinous convicts and they parleyed witn
the Warden. They sent him word that If
he would promise not to inflict punish
ment fnr their action thev would surren
der and come up. To this the Warden
would not consent, sending- down word
that the surrender mu?t be unconditional,
the question of punishment to be consid
ered later. As the night wore on the War
den held a consultation with his officers
and it was decided to nuempt a rescue of
the pusrds and also to overawe the con
victs and foroo their surrender. Select
ing his men the Warden with seven or
eight guards, heavily aimed, entered the
hoist and were soon sp*-oJing downward.
Convicts Compelled to Yield.
The first outbreak in the mine took
place shortly after the noon meal yester
day and was started by the convicts in
division No. 8. Of the nineteen men In
this division sixteen seized the guard and
overpowered him and announced that
they had decided to strike. They told
the guard that thev had decided to mine
two Instead of three cars of coal as a
Cay's work in the future and that they
proposed to have better food. This guard
was left in charge of two of the con
victs in the mutiny while the others
marched to the adjoining division and
epread the revolt and called on the con
vict* to Join. The convicts were soon
marching through the mine from one di
vision to another, yelling and swinging
their lamps and picks. Other desperate
convicts entered into the spirit. Short
term men generally offered no opposition
to the mutineers and quietly Joined them.
Many complaints have been made at
the penitentiary by the prisoners because
ol the grade of food furnished them, and
to this dissatisfaction have been added
p negations of mistreatment. The first
trouble was displayed last night, when
the miners who had entered the mine in
the morning refused to go to the surface
unless their demands wt-re granted. War
den Tomlinson refused and the prisoners
remained In the mines all night, prevent
ing the fifteen guards over them from
going above and additional guards from
entering the mine. They killed the mules
used In the mine and liv^d on this meat.
Two 'hundred and thirty-four convicts.
who went down into the mines on Monday
morning-, held fifteen guards at hostages.
They refused to let the guards go to the
surface until Warden Tomlinson should
promise to give them, better food, and
thjeatened to kill the guards if their de
mands were not complied with. The
mines are run by the worst class of pris
oners in the penitentiary, and among: the
men who mutinied were twenty life pris
oners.

GRASS VALLEY. March 19.â Th<Â»
famous North Star lejjge, in the central
shaft, has been struck at a vertical depth
of 1600 feet. It Is the biggest proposition
to be developed in Nevada County and a
company with "substantial backing and
capable management has had the perse
verance to stay with it until success
crowned Its efforts. . .
Four . years ago the North Star Mines
Company set aside an appropriation of
$100,000 to sink the shaft and develop the
central; which It was calculated would cut
through the New York Hill and North
Star veins and enable the company to de
velop the whole of that section for a
radius of a mile or more. This appropria
tion proved inadequate, but the work was
continued. The news of its successful
termination Is creating quite a boom.

For many months Truckee has been the
headquarters for disorderly characters
and every day petty crimes have been
committed, yet none of the culprits have
been punished. The officers Â¦- are either
negligent or unable to cope with them
and the citizens have adopted drastic
measures to drive ouc the vicious element.
TRUCKEE, March 19.-Fifty masked
men, all heavily armed, paraded the
streets of Truckee " to-night and posted
notices in all public resorts notifying the
rough characters who have long Infested
Truckee to depart immediately. They
style themselves "The 601," and threaten
summary punishment upon those disobey
ing fheir orders.

ORDER ROUGHS
TO LEAVE TOWN
The election of sjfand officers for tho
ensuing term was made the special order
for 10 o'clock this ' morning. - In the even
ing there .was a: banquet to the grand
officers and representatives.. Grand As
sistant Dictator Salomon was toastmaster
and at the table with him sat Grand Dic
tator Archibald, Past Grand Dictator
Barnes, Supreme Representative Curry,
Grand "Vice Dictator Holcomb, Grand
Chaplain Warncke. Â¦<.-Â¦ The toasts of the
evening were: "Knights of Honor," re
sponded to by. Grand Dictator Archibald;
"Past Dictators' Association," A. M. Mac
pherson; "Supreme Lodge," C..F. Curry,
Grand Reporter Thomas Johnstone and
PÂ«st Grand Dictator Fred Raabe; "Fra
ternity," Grand Vico Dictator Holcomb;
"The Ladies/' E. - F. Joy;
Brethren," w. H. Barnes, P. G. D. Dur
ing the evening the company was enter
tained', with music by - the Columbian
Quartet and Henry C. Larsen and special
ties by Billy Hynes and Richard L'.Wha
len. ; Â¦
After routine business the Grand Lodge
resolved itself into a committee of tht
whole when Â« a proposition to make the
office-, of grand dictator an unsalaried
one was discussed at length. The prop
osition was lost.
C. F. Curry,, Ben 1. Salomon and E. F.
Joy were appointed a committee to pre
pare resolutions in memory of the. late
ex-President Harrlso)i, who was a mem
ber of thÂ« order. â¢ . -
The reports of the grand officers were
presented and referred > to the committees
authorized to receive them.. These show
that the order, while having to contend
with newer organizations that by reason
of being young are oftering better induce
ments to those seeking membership in an
order of this character It has held Its
own. During the past two years six
lodges consolidated with others, 132 deaths
occurred j and the amount paid . to bene
ficiaries was $258,000. One new lodge was
institutedâ Fremont at Salinas.
The first session of the Grand Lodge,
Knights of Honor of California, opened
yesterday. in the Alcazar building, Grand
Dictator Archibald presiding. All the
grand officers 1 and representatives were
present at rpll call. The grand lodge de
gree was conferred upon fifteen eliglbles.

Woodworth Is Sworn In.
The commission of Marshall B. Wood

was presented to Judge Morrow In the
United States Circuit Court yesterday by
F. L. Coombs, the retiring United States
District Attorney. Mr. Coombs eulogized
Mr. Wood worth, and Judge Morrow eulo
gized Mr. Coombs and expressed the hope
that the Congressman would not abandon
the bar now that he had become a poli
tician. Then Mr. Woodworth eulogized
Judge Morrow and Mr. Coombs, . after
which Mr. Woodworth took the oath of
offlce and received the congratulations of
his friends.
The homecoming: from the Legislature
was a sad half day for the "push" ele
ment of San Francisco. The "cinch" bills
of the session failed to produce the results
so fondly hoped for and long was the re
frain of disappointment. Martin Kelly did
not attempt to enliven the spirits of his
despondent followers. He simply remark
ed from time to time in dreary monotone
that the "boys hadn't been treated right."
Sam Rainey echoed the sentiment that
the boys were badly treated. "Colonel"
Martin Brady was the only one of tha
crowd that did not succumb to the gloom
of the dreary occasion. This hero of Junk
ets fared better than the most favored of
his associates, yet the session did not
yield the "stuff" that the Assemblyman of
the Forty-third expected. . ; -
Comments on the "tightness" of the
Santa Fe Impelled the "colonel" to speak
hia mind about corporations in general
and this one in particular. As the train
of the Southern Pacific was nearlng the
Santa Fe crossing at San Pablo the "col
onel was told that he might have the
privilege of walking on the Santa Fe. track
to Point Richmond. After reflectine on
the prospect, the "colonel" remarked: "I
wouldn't get off the track for a train un
less the whistle was blown. I would make
the company give up something if only
the sound of the whistle, which was more
than was given up at Sacramento."
At the outset the old timers, sizing up
the value of the China Basin lease- as a
water front privilege, figured that the
company ought to give the boys an op
portunity to divide a sack of J40.000. Why
the figure was placed at $40,000 It is not
clearly explained, but the "push" enter
tained the belief that the Santa Fe should
"loosen up" and "do the proper thing." It
was remarked that three of the Senators,
as well as several Assemblymen, made
a serious protest against the grasping and
selfish tactics of the Santa Fe. "The boys
are hunery and the Santa Fe should do
something for them," pathetically ex
claimed an old timer In the Senate, and
while the "push" was waiting for the sack
that never came the Legislature ad
journed.
The â¢session In the Senate was not de
void of amusing incidents. A San Fran
cisco Senator, whose eyesight is not of
the keenest, on more than one occasion
addressed remarks to Dr. Rowell. fancy
ing that he was speaking to Senator J. R.
Tyrrell. Dr. Rowell's hair is gray and
abundant and so is the hair of Senator
Tyrrell.
The last named Senator began to appre
hend that mistaken Identity might cause
secrets to be given to Dr. Rowell which
the Senator from Fresno would not keep.
Therefore Tyrrell said to his colleague
from San Francisco: . . : *Â¦
"You ought to get a dark lantern an'l
make sure that you do not. give to Dr.
Rowell the points in our business." â¢

proof or modern In any way the, valuable
collection of bocks should be protected by
the erection of a new building.
A resolution was offered and Â¦ adopted
which provided for the appointment of a

into the selection of a site and the cost
of a new building. : ->. .. :

RAILWAY COMPANY PAYS
IX5NG DISPUTED TAXES
Sheriff Ties Up Trains and Brings
Sierra Valley Railway Com
pany to Terms.
Attorney. General Tirey L. Ford ha3
finally succeeded in compelling the Sierra
Valley Railway Company to pay Kg
taxes on property holdings ln Lassen and
Plumas counties.' The matter has been in
the courts from time to time during the
last five years, but nothing was accom
plished up to yesterday, when $7434 52, the
full amount of the taxes up to the begin
nlg of the current year, was paid by the
railroad company to Attorney General
Ford.
Suits have been entered to collect theoe
taxes as they become due, and in Janu
ary, 1000; judgments were entered in fa
vor of the State. Executions were at
once Issued to the . Lasaen and Plumas
counties Sheriffs. I The Lassen County
Sheriff took possession of one of the com
pany's trains Just as it was pulling out of
a station. Finding its rolling stock tied
up the company hastened to take steps in
the way of settlement. â
Negotiations were- Â«it that time under
way for the sale of the properties, Â¦ and
pending the sale securities were given by
the company. Yesterday morning Pres'
dent H. A. Bowen of the Sierra Valley
Railroad. Company transmitted a draft for
the amount of the taxes to Deputy Attor
ney General Sturtevant. thus settling the
dispute. -. wv,;
\ u Â¥ e ~f or a compromise came through
John T. Harmes, Mrs. Murray's agent.
"I got a telephone message one dav
from Mr. Harmes," said Hassett yester
day, making an appointment with me
t, el i z i. his offlce on Market street. I
think the message came over the tele
phone from Mrs. Murray's residence and
the time set was fifteen minutes later. I
went to the real estate offlce with which
he is connected and there met Mrs. Mur
ray. We went upstairs, and after much
talk a proposition was made to pay Mr
B Â°th n M $25 ??- I did not accent I t P telling
both Mr. Harmes and Mrs. Murray that
1 v y?? 1<i have to consult with Mr. Boland.
~,Â« . ne # xt received a telephone
message from Harmes, and he asked
W hat have you done about that matter?'

Hassett's demand for administrator's
commissions is a unique memorandum It
was apparently written hastily and is in
lead pencil. The fees claimed are those
allowed by law. and Hassett very gener
ously remarks. "No attorney's fees." It is
claimed that this demand, or memoran
dum, was filed at Mrs. Murray's request
The case will come up before Judge
Troutt thi-s moraine at 11 o'clock and an
other wordy warfare is expected. A deci
sion will probably be rendered at this
time on the application of Mrs. Murray for
a partial distribution. y
Doors of Places Bobbed Are Smashed
NUMEROUS BURGLARIES
MYETIFY THE POLICE
In, Showing Evidence of Or-
ganized Gang.
Numerous robberies have been commit
ted over at North Beach during the last
week, and the police think they were the
work of an organized gang. Last Thurs
day morning the room of John Torgin In
a lodging-house at 539 Vallejo street, was
entered and robbed while he was at
breakfast. He found upon his return to
his room that the door had been smashed
from its ninees and the room ransacked
A valuable sold watch, a revolver and
160 were missing. The door had evidently
been smashed in with a sledgehammer,
but none of the occupants of the house
was disturbed by the noise.
Burglars entered the saloon and dance
hall of Manuel Terry at 222 Montgomery
avenue early Sunday morning, rifled the
cash register of $10 and carried off a quan
tity of liquor. The door of this place was
also smashed In. A shoe store on Powell
street was robbed a short time ago ln al
most the same manner.
The saloon of Joseph Frietas at 416
Jackson street was entered early Mon
w? i mo . I ? Ingr -_Â« Thft bur elars took the cash
left in the register and also a quantity of
liquors and a number of cigars.
Later in the morning Frietas discovered
a 1â¢^" tr *' fn K t0 dispose of a demijohn of
whisky on Pacific street. He notified De
tective Ed Wren, who arrested the fellow
He is known as "Shorty. McNall." â¢
A PLUM of nearly $SO00 is worth
fighting for, according to the
Ideas of Public Administrator
Boland. If he can secure con
trol of the estate of the late Mrs.
Almlra 6. Townsend his commissions will
amount, placing the value of the estate
left by her at $600,000. to just $7820. One
of the matters that will come up in tho
controversy Is the alleged offer of Mrs.
Murray to compromise for $2500.
- On a small sheet of paper, torn from a
notebook apparently. Attorney Hassett
has set forth his contention la words and
figures. This little piece of paper will be
an exhibit in the case and is tenderly
treasured, although, according to the
Ideas of Sullivan & Sullivan, it is worth
nothing. It reads as follows:
$1,000. 7 p?r cent $79

One of the interesting features in the
pending litigation is the question of the
date upon which the order of Judge Dunne
was entered placing the estate in the
hands of Mrs. Murray and the date on
which the appeal was filed. Judge
Dunne s decision was rendered on Septem
ber 17. last year, and was ordered entered
on October 4. The following day a more
elaborate and formal decree was entered
l n * h Â« Kinwes at the request of Sullivan
& Sullivan.
Now the law gives sixty days' time Jn
which to appeal. If the first decree en
tered on October 4 Is the one of record,
then the apDeal from the ruling of the
court made bv Attorney Hassett for Ad
ministrator Boland on December 4 was
one day behind time, being filed sixty-one
cays later. The order entered by Sullivan
& Sullivan, it is claimed, is only supple
mentary to the cne entered by order of
the court the previous day.
Administrator Boland claims that he is
entitled to administer because Mrs. Mur
ray was not a resident of tne State at the
time ehe filf-d her application for letters of
administration.
"Why," Â«-aid Mr. Boland. "she Just lock
ed up her house, left the key with a neigh
bor and came out here before her mother
knew anything about her coming. She
was goinjr right back, and I feel that the
estate under the circumstances should fall
into my hands."
Attorney Hassett claims that all over-
CRAVEN" CASE RECORD
IS STRAIGHTENED OUT
Motion Made by District Attorney
Byington Is Granted by
Judge Cook.
District Attorney Bylngton. with the ob
ject in view of straightening out the rec
ord In the perjury case against Mrs. Net
tie R. Craven, made a motion before
Judge Cook yesterday that the notice of
appeal, filed March 1 last, from the order
of the court sustaining the demurrer be
withdrawn and the demurrer filed in the
case b^ stricken from the calendar. ICo
objection wan offered by the defendant's
attorneys and the motion was granted.
The order of February 2. sustaining the
demurrer, ti-sls vacated and set aside and
the demurrer was pieced on the reserve
calendar pending the decision of the Su
preme Court on the motion to set aElde
the indictment of the Grand Jury.
If the motion to set aside the Indictment
is sustained by the Supreme Court It will
Â«r.d the whole matter and will obviate the
necessity for a demurrer, but if, on the
contrary, the motion is not sustained the
d^murrrr can then be taken up. In
either case it does not prevent the District
Attorney from p'.arir.g the matter before
the present Grand Jury and procuring an
other indictment.
Charges of bigamy and fraud are to be
filed against the notorious swindler and
ex-convict. "Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper,
alias Huntington. . .
Cooper made another appearance In the
courtroom of Police Judge Fritz yester
day afternoon, when the charge of forging
a seal of a court of record was proceeded
with. The usual crowd of spectators was
present.
Police Officer Bryan, who arrested
Cooper on March 7 In Ogden, testified that
ho found the seal and press In possession
of the prisoner.. The seal bears the words:
"In the High Court of Chancery. Probate,
London, E. C."
Attorney Murphy, on behalf of Cooper,
moved that the case be dismissed on the
ground that no evidence had been lntror
duced by the prosecution to show that
Cooper had forged a seal of a court of
record. Murphy also asked that the testi
mony of Captain ColvilloÂ«df Crockett and
Cashier Fitzpatrick of tne Donohoe-Kelly
Bank be stricken from the records, as
their evidence had been taken with the
understanding that the prosecution prove
the charge against Coopers _,. , ,
Assistant District Attorney W hltlng ar
gued that sufficient proof had been pre
sented to show that Cooper had forged the
seal purporting to be of a court of record,
and that he could be held for trial.
Judge Fritz intimated that more evi
dence must be forthcoming, and when
the prosecution asked for a continuance
Attorney -Murphy opposed it. -After a
wrangle . among the attorneys as to
whether the case should go on. it was de
cided to adjourn the hearing until this
afternoon at 2 o'clock.
While the police feel confident that they
can convict Cooper on the charge of
"forging a telegTam with Intent to de
fraud Nora Schneider," It Is the opinion
of many criminal lawyers that Cooper
will be given his liberty on the habeas
corpus proceedings. . which his attorney
will be instituted. in a few days.
The positive evidence that Nora Schnei
der was defrauded by the bogus telegram,
sent in her mother's name by Cooper, can
only be supplied by the girl herself, and
the law will not permit her to testify, as
she Is held to be the wife of the prisoner.
If It can be proven, that Cooper com
mitted bigamy in marying Nora Schnei
der the marriage can be annulled,. and
then the girl can givo evidence.
Cooper and his attorney know this, and
will hurry'wlth the habeas corpus pro
ceedings, so there will be no chance of the
girl being placed on the witness stand.
Much surprise Is expressed in legal,cir
cles that the police did not Include In the
extradition, papers the charge of obtaining
money under false pretenses. While
charges of bigamy and fraud are to be
filed against Coooer, It Is doubtful If he
could be prosecuted on them. Under the
extradition proceedings Cooper has a
legal home in Utah, and the Governor of
that State only permitted the prisoner to
be brought to California under the under
standing that he would be prosecuted on
the two charges mentioned . In the extra
dition documents.

cusations of Bigamy
and Fraud.

CHARLES NELSON.
it the well-known lumber dealer
Wand shipowner, surprised his
friends and acquaintances yester
day by quietly marrying â¢ Miss
Helen Stind, his former housekeeper.
CAPTAIN , CHARLES NELSON,
WHO HAS MARRIED HIS
FORMER HOUSEKEEPER*.
Captain Charles Nelson Marries For
mer Housekeeper-, Miss Helen Stind,
and They Depart on Wedcling Tour
The ceremony was solemnized by Rev
Dr. Rader of the Third Congregational
Church. At noon the newly married
couple left for Humboldt on the steamer
Pomona for a short wedding tour. Oi
theJr return they will reside in San .Fran
cisco for a few weeks only, preparatoiy
to an extended European trip.
Mr. Nelson is 67 years old and his bride
42. \ Nevertheless, despite the disparity in
their ages, long acquaintance ripened into
love and Intimate friends say it would ba
hard to find a more devoted couple.
Mrs. Nelson is a native of Denmark and
came to this country about fifteen years
ago. Her acquaintance w"ith Mr. Nelson
began about ten years ago, when she was
employed at his house as a housekeeper.
She remained In the employ of Mr. Nelson
up to two years ago, when she took up
quarters at 2332 Mission street, where she
has lived since that time.
The couple have been engaged for about
a year, but the matter has been kept a
secret from all save a few â¢ Intimate
friends. Mrs. Nelson Is well educated and
very popular among a large circle of ac
quaintances.
Mr. Nelson Is well known, throughout
the commercial world of the "West. He
is a man of considerable wealth and has
been identified with many extensive busi
ness enterprises. The captain is now vice
president of the Pacific Lumber Company
of Scotia, Humboldt County; vice presi
dent of the Dickens Lumber Company of
San Francisco, local agent for the St. Paul
and Tacoma Lumber Company of Wash
ington and is the owner of several ships.
WEALTHY SHIP 0WNER
BECOMES A BENEDICT
Had the Supreme Court reversed the
judgment of Judge Hughes of Sacramento
in the case of the county of Yolo against
Edwin P. Colpan, Controller, the State
treasury wouid have been compelled to
pay out to various counties in the State
a sum of money aggregating $1,244,000. In
affirming the decision of the Superior
Judge yesterday the appellate court pre
vented such a loss. ' â¢
Action was brought by the county of
Yolo against the Controller to compel
the latter to allow the county a rebate In
the Bum of $26,771 20 in his settlement "for
commissions, charges arid fees as directed
and fixed by law to be allowed to it for
services of its Auditor and Assessor in
connection with the State taxes for the
fiscal year of 1893-4." The case was tried
in Sacramento County before Judge
Hughes, who rendered a decision In favor
of the Controller. An appeal was taken
to the Supreme Court, and that body yes
terday affirmed the judgment of the low
er court. .
Contention of Petitioner.
The contention of the petitioner, tho
county, was that these funds in the way
of commissions belonged to the counties
in accordance with. the law of 1861, and
also embodied in the new constitution;
and. further, that in accordance with the
revenue act of 1S74 this money belonged
wholly to the counties, because the coun
ty government act provided that the sums
allowed the various officers as salaries
was in full of all demands for- the ser
vices of such officers, and therefore no
further sums could be collected by them
on their own account, as these commis
sions belonged to the Treasurer of the
county.
In 1S93 an abolishing act was passed by
the Legislature which is supposed to have
repealed this former act. A further con
tention was that the abolishing- act of 1893
was unconstltutionel and was not an act,
for the reason that It had never passed
in accordance with the terms of the con
stitution, which are mandatory. It Is
claimed the abolishing act did not receive
the requisite number of votes in passage,
having received but twenty, and not a
majority of the votes of the Senate.
The Supreme Court in affirming the
judgment holds that recourse cannot be
had to an impeachment of the journal of
the Legislature showing the number of
ayes and noes recorded upon the passage
of an act. The fact that the president
and the eecretary of the Senate certify
that the bill has passed In regular form
Is sufficient for all purposes, and there
fore the abolishing act of 1S93 and the
county government act of 1893 are both
legal measures.
Following Is an excerpt from the deci
sion:
Constitutional Provisions.
The law-making power of the State is vested
by the constitution In the Legislature; and
while the constitution has prescribed the for
malities to be observed in the passage of bills
and creation of statutes, the power to deter
mine whether these formalities have been com
plied with is necessarily vested in the Legis
lature Itself, rince if It were not. it would
be powerless to enact a statute. The consti
tution has not provided that this essential
power thus vested in the Legislature ehall be
subject to review by the courts, while it has
expressly provided that no person charged with
the exercise of powers properly belonging to
any of these departments, legislative, executive
and Judicial, Into which the powers of the
government are divided, shall exercise any
functions pertaining to either of the others.
The opinion â¢was. Â¦written by the Com
pissloners and concurred In by Justices
<raroutte. Hershaw, McFarland and Van
Dyke. Justices Temple and Harrison dis
sented. Chief Justice Beatty did not par
ticipate. .
