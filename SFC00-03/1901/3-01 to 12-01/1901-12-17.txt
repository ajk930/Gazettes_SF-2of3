CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â Germany
lias officially informed the United States
of her purpose to compel Venezuela to
pay the just claims of German, subjects.
This announcement, made by Baron
von Kolleben, the German Ernbassador,
has been coupled 'with definite and posi
tive assurances that Germany has no in
tention of permanently occupying, the
Venexuelan port, which it may prove
necessary for her to seize. Secretary
Hay has communicated these assurances
to the President.
There is reason to believe that in re
turn tor the courtesy shown by Ger
many, the United States has made an ex
plicit statement of its position-
America Not to Interfere.
The German Embassador understands
that this Government does not propose
to interfere with any punitive measures
â¢R'hich a European government may find
It necessary to enforce against an Amer
ican republic Intervention will occur
when a European nation seizes territory'
without just cause and attempts to hold it
Jjermariently. Furthermore. Germany is
Eware that In sending so many warships
to the Caribbean Sea the United States
Is not actuated by any wish to keep close
â watch on her doings. The ships are sent
to West Indian waters for the purpose
of engaging in drill. No objection would
be raised by Germany if the United States
vere to order a warship to the port
vhich she contemplated seizing, for she
understands that American interests re
culre protection.
Moreover, Germany feels that she has
Siotbing to conceal. It is her intention
to act well within the law of nations and
custom. She will make a naval demon
stration in Venezuelan waters, and if this
does not produce the desired effect, then
the seizure of a port â which one cannot
be learned- will follow. The port 'will
probably be La Guayra,
â¢â¢ * _ - â â¢_
Castro May Declare War.
President Castro bas asserted that he
Vrfll declare any port seized a free port.
International lawyers here say that this
will not embarrass Germany. She will
merely direct the application of a tariff
which will be equivalent to the "Vene
zuelan tariff, and the duties collected un
der it will be used to defray the bill of
damages which she holds against Vene
zuela. The United States would natur
ally prefer that Venezuela should pay
claims she owes and thus prevent forci
ble action by Germany.
President Castro understands the atti-
tude of tne United States In this respect,
f but his obstinacy has thus far caused him
to refuse to make admissions.
It may be that Castro will declare war
against Germanyâ a declaration which
would be deprecated by the United States
because of the license it would give to a
European power. But even In case of
war. it is stated that the policy of the
United States against German occupancy
of Venezuelan territory as indemnity for
uie expense to which the Berlin Govern
ment would be put would be upheld by
the President, and Germany fully under
stands Roosevelt's attitude in this respect.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â The
: . Senate to-day ratified the
Hay-Pauncefote Isthmian
canal treaty by the decisive
r i,.'-^vote of T2 to 6. The vote
was reached a few minutes
before 5 o'clock after almost five hours'
discussion behind closed doors. There
were no sensational Incidents during. the
entire time. The debate was confined ex
clusively to a discussion of the merits of
the agreement and the policy of Its provi
sions.
The principal speech of the day was
made by. Senator Teller, In opposition to
the treaty, and he was followed in rapid
succession by twelve or -fifteen other Sen
ators, who epoke briefly either for or
against the motion to ratify. Teller ex
pressed confidence that the resolution
would be adopted, and while he had no
purpose to prevent that result, he was
convinced that there -are very few Sena
tors who are really satisfied with the
treaty. With Great Britain in her. pres
ent mood, he believes It would have been
possible to secure a treaty which would
give entire satisfaction, and he sharply
criticised the State department for fail
ing to do so. He took the position that
it would have been sufficient to abrogate
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,, and- sajd that
England knew well- enough that , with
that result accomplished she could' very

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., Dec. 16.-Upon ro
turning late to-night from Cape Spear,
where he went to inspect the site for a
wireless station, Marconi received a letter
from the solicitors of the Anglo-American
JÂ£9lfiffraiih.X!ompany giving notice that the
sole and exclusive right to. operate or
construct any system of telegraphic com
munication in the colony to places out
side of the colony is owned by it. Conse
quently they notify him that the work In
which he is engaged Is in direct violation
of the rights and privileges granted to
the company by its charter from the Gov
ernment. The solicitors add that unless
they receive promptly an intimation that
he will not proceed further with his pres
ent work legal proceedings will be begun
to restrain him. ttfl
Marconi had little success at Capo
Spear. The weather was bad, rain and
fog prevailing. As far as he could judgo
the main advantages of Cape Spear aro
that it is, the nearest point to England.
It is a . peninsula running out into the
sea, and is in close proximity to the light
house, which has telegraphic communica
tion with St. Johns. The land is not too
high, and there is no high land near it.
but tlius far he Is not satisfied that it
would be a convenient location for a sta
tion. He will try to pay another visit in.
more favorable weather.
Message on New Year's Day.
Marconi Is at present more favorably
impressed with Quidividi, a. small villaga
about two miles north of St. Johns, main
ly, because it Is close to the city and tha
general conditions seem favorable. He
will examine this site soon. He says it is
most desirable for the station to be, if
possible, on a point of land almost sur
rounded by water. This is proved by the
excellent results obtained on ships, con
sidering the strength of the batteries.
The . inventor - will probably leave here
for, England on the Allan line steamer
due here Friday. He hopes to inaugurate
the new year by sending a special mes
sage. He will go direct to Cornwall and*
take charge of matters there. By mtd
aummer, it is asserted, he will have fully
equipped the station here for sending and
receiving messages between America and
England, and another station on the Mas
sachusetts coast.
When informed to-day that Thomas
Edison did not credit the report of sig
nals having been received he. replied thai
the signals were received by himself and
were absolutely genuine.

LONDON. Dec. 16.â A cable dispatch
has been received here from St. Johns. N.
F., announcing. that Sigr.or ilarconl will
sail for England December .19.
At the headquarters here of the invent
or of wireless. telegraphy it was said to
day by the officials In charge that the ex
periments at St. Johns, so far as they
know, are all over. They do not expect
to hear any further details until Signer
Marconi arrives In London.
It was "said that storms on both sides
of the Atlantic had seriously Interfered
with the work, which the officials say
would have been much more satisfactory
under normal weaiher conditions, the
Poldhu, Cornwall, station having been se
riously damaged by high winds.
The officials at Poldhu refuse to con

St. Johns that messages had been re

DEWEY'S REPORT
Thinks the Admiral Best
Judge in Schley's
Case.
T _ionÂ£ Agrees to Withhold
Action Until Counsel
Files Exceptions.
CINCINNATI. Dec. 16.â General Nelson
A. Miles, speaking to-day of the findings
of the Sehley court of inqiury, said:
I am willing to take the Judgment of Ad
miral Ifcrwey in ihe matter. He has l>eÂ«n u.
commander of a fleet and as such has known
the anxieties ana responsibilities which rest
upon u man under these circunrstHnces. He
Wat instrumental in the destruction of one
fc>jjanij=h fleet and known and realizes the feel
ings that c-neompass an officer under such con
ditions. 1 Â«hlnk Dewey has summed up the
matter In u clear and concise manner and I
believe his conclusions will be indorsed by
the patriotic people of the United Slates. I
have no sympathy with the efforts which have
been made to destroy the honor of an officer
under such circumstances.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16. â Admiral
Sehley was in consultation all this fore
noon with his counsel, hon. lsador Ray
ner and M. A. Teague, also General Felix
Agnus of Baltimore and Congressman
Schirm of Maryland. After the confer
ence Admiral Sehley authorized Teague
to make the following statement:
We have been in consultation as to what
further proceedings shall be taken. Nothing
definite has been determined so tar as civil
or criminal action of any kind against Maclay
anÂ«l his sponsors is concerned. Maclay's claim
that the findings cf the court are a vindica
tion for himself and his book is absolutely
â¢purious. There are no less than half a dozen
instances in the book in which, even If he were
to copy the findings or the court and Incorpo
rate them into the volume and ehanee It to
puit the findings, the book would still be crim
inal libel.
May Appeal to the President.
Mr. Teague. during the forenoon, pre
sented the following letter to Secretary
Long:
WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 1C. 1901.â Sir:
I have the honor to most respectfully request
that you will withhold your approval from the
findings of the court of inquiry recently held
at the nan-yard In the city of Washington,
of which Admiral George Dewey was presi
dent, until such time ls I may have an op
portunity to file a statement of objections
thereto, and I therefore request that you do
not dissolve the court until action shall have
l#en taken on such objections. Very respect
\v. S. SCHLEY. Rear Admiral. U. S. N.
ISADOR RAYNER. Counsel for the Appll
, cant before said Court of Inquiry.
0 To the Hon. Secretary of the Navy.
He asked the Secretary to indicate his
probable action in the premises. The Sec
retary replied that the request would be
'granted and his action on the findings
and the dissolution of the court withheld
until the objections were received and he
has had an opportunity to consider them.
He stated that he would communicate
with Admiral Sehley in writing, and
asked how long a time counsel desired in
which to present their objections. Teague
replied that they would be ready for pre
sentation by Thursday or Friday of this
week.
"We will except to the finding's of the
court," said Teague, "and make a de
mand that the majority opinion be disap
proved by the Secretary as contrary to
the evidence and the pertinent facts in
the case which the court has not consid
ered nor acted upon."
Tenders Thanks to Sehley.
At the opening of to-day's session of
the Senate Jones of Arkansas introduced
a joint resolution, as follows:
That the thanks of Congress and the Ameri
can people are hereby tendered to Rear Ad
miral Winfleld S. Sehley and the officers and
men under his command for highly distin
guished conduct in conflict with the enemy,
as displayed by them In the destruction of the
Spanish fleet off the harbor of Santiago, Cuba.
July B. 1898.
That the President of the United States be
requested to cause this resolution to be com
municated to Rear Admiral Sehley and through
him to the officers and raen under his com
mand.
Without comment the resolution was
referred to the Committee on Naval Af
fairs.
Since the court of Inquiry rendered Its
verdict Rear Admiral Sehley has received
a large number of letters and telegrams,
all containing- expressions of confidence
and esteem and offers of assistance.' To
answer these personally would be a work
of such magnitude that the admiral has
addressed the following letter to the As
sociated Press, which he asks to be pub
lished:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16. â To the Associated
Press: I beg to express through the medium
of the Associated Press my gratitude and
heartfelt thanks for the kind words and evi
dences of interest in my welfare which I have
received from all parts of the United States.
The magnitude of the correspondence renders
it impossible for me to personally acknowledge
the time, and I therefore take this means of
expressing my appreciation to one and alL

HARRISBURG. Pa., Dec. 16.â Many in
dustrial establishments in South Harris
burg have been forced to close down on
account of the freshet, the water in that
locality being higher than at any time
since the great tlood of 1889. Many houses
in that locality' were surrounded with I
water and it was necessary to use boats
to carry lood and fuel to many residents
who were unable to leave their homes.
The damage, however, will be very slignt.
It is expectel that the water will recede
during the next twenty-four hours and
that the factories will be able to resume
operations.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 16.âCommuni
cation with the outside world is being
gradually opened. At 10:40 p. m. a train
started for Philadelphia and New York
over the Delaware and Hudson and the
Pennsylvania Railroad, via Sunbury and
Harrisburg, carrying some of the dele
gates who had attended the American
federation of Labor Convention. The
others left to-night. Tha- Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western got its road

stretch at Delaware Water Gap,, where
the Delaware River had flooded the
tracks to the depth of seven feet. The
waters had receded from the tracks at 3

Many Herders Perish.
CHEYENNE, Wyo.,Dec. 16.â The storm
that set in last Tuesday night has in
creased to a blizzard in this state and at
many points business is almost entirely
suspended. The railroads are keeping
their lines open to traffic with much diffi
culty and a blockade is threatening.
Reports from the ranges in Southern
Wyoming tell of the demoralization of
the sheep business, flocks being scattered
in all directions and the herders dead and
missing. Many conflicting: reports of the
loss of life are being received, but certain
it is that no one could live long out of
doors in such a storm as is now raging
I throughout the State, and when the fury
of the blizzard has finally subsided it is
' expected that bodies of dead herders will
be found at numerous points in the Red
Desert country, where a number of flock
tenders are now reported missing.
! Reports from the. ranges say that the
present storm is the worst that ever visit
ed this section of the country and that if
it continues for another twenty-four hours
the losses will be heavy.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 16.â Another storm
struck Northern and Western Nebraska
this afternoon and in some parts of the
State it is the worst experienced since the
great blizzard of 1888. The most serious
reports come from along the line of the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, "TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1901.
MANY PRISONERS ARE GIVEN RELEASE
AT THE TWO BRANCH COUNTY JAILS
Motley Throng of Men and Women Set at Liberty Under Operation of a New
Law and Dozens of Vagrants Escape Serving Their Terms of Punish
ment and in Winter Dawn Hurry From Confinement to Forme Haunts
THE largest release of prisoners
from a place of confinement that
has ever taken place , In this
State was made early yesterday,
morning at Branch County Jails
Nos. 2 and 3," near the Ingleside road, when
105 men and twenty-eight -women were set
at liberty. The women were set free an
hour earlier than the men.
A law passed at the last State Legisla
ture was responsible for the big jail de
livery, and sixty of the prisoners secured
their freedom after serving but four and
five days' detention, though sentenced to
thirty days' imprisonment.
The section of the penal code under
which Captain A. J. Martin, the jail su
perintendent, -was forced -to let his
"boarders" free, went into effect on
February 20 of this year, and is as fol
lows: ;
Every person now confined in or that may
hereafter be committed to and confined In any
penitentiary, prison, Jail, house of detention,
reform school, or other penal institution, by
whatsoever name the same may now or here
after be known in this State, under conviction
for a penal offense, shall be discharged on a
Monday, regardless of the day of the week
upon which the term or time of conHnement
prescribed in the sentence or terminated by
credits or commutation would otherwise ex
pire, unless the Monday upon or preceding the
day in the same week upon which the sentence
or commutation would otherwise expire shall
fall upon or precede, within four days, a legal
holiday. In which event such person shall be
discharged upon the first Monday preceding
that, which will not be upon or be followed by.
a holiday within four days.
Hypo Fiends Sell j Coats.
Persons whose term would expire next
week or during the first week of the com
ing year were set free yesterday under the
clause of the law.
Captain Martin and his deputies were
kept busy yesterday morning in prepar
ing for the wholesale release of the pris
oners. The men and the women were giv
en a good- breakfast and advised to keep
away from the I Chinatown "gin mills"
that caused the majority of them to be
deprived of their freedom. '
As the sun threw its rays over the Mis
sion hills Captain Martin lined up the

in the bank they secured nothing. The

LABOR CONFERS
WITH CAPITAL
Conferees Discuss Plans
to Bring About In
/ dustrial Peace.
General Exchange of Views
on How Best to Avoid
Disputes.
â¢ NEW YORK. Dec. 16.â Brought together
through the good offices of the National
Civic Federation, leading representatives
of labor and capital met here to-day to
discuss plans to minimize wage and In
dustrial disputes. Attending them with
counsel were several prominent students
of economics and leading figures in the
religious world, and the opening" session
was notable for a number of striking ex
pressions and comments upon the problem
laced by the conferees. The storm in
Eastern Pennsylvania prevented Samuel
Gompers, John Mitchell, Theodore Shaffer
and other leaaing members of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor from reacning
New York in time for the meeting to-day,
but they will participate in the session to
morrow. Oscar Strauss, former Minister
to Turkey, wno acted as chairman, an
nounced that it \*as planned to form a
general executive committee, with repre
sentation divided between labor, capita,
and the general public, and it was hoped
it would become a tribunal of peace,
where the conflicting Interests might meet
on equal footing ana settle their differ
ences in a spirit of conciliation and mu
tual toleration.
Senator M. A. , Hanna, Charles M.
Schwab, president of the United State3
Steel Corporation; Archbishop Ireland,
Bishop Potter, B. R. Calioway, president
of the American Locomotive Work3; K.
D. JDurrant, secretary of the Industrial
Commission; Theodore Masburg of iJaitl
more, W. F. Pfahler of Philadelphia, R. C.
Kerens of St. Louis, R. M. Easley of the
National Civic Federation, John Phiilip3
of the National Hatters" Union, James
Ryan of the International Typographical
Union and Marcus Marks, president â¬>f
the National Clothing Association, wero
among the men who attended the opening
meeting. Charles M. Schwab declare J
that he was opposed to labor unions as
they were now constituted, and said that
they must fail, as the trusts had failed, in
seeking to limit the output and control
the prices. Schwab said in part:
"Schwab Declares Against Unions.
I. am here with a mind open to conviction,
anxious to see the other side of the Held, as
Bishop Potter has said, and ready to do that
which is fair. It may be that this is a selfish
motive, bat I realize that upon the peaceful
adjustment of the difficulties that exist be
tween capital and labor depends the future
prosperity of the United States. The decad
ence in trade in other countries is due to thÂ»
hostility of labor unions. I do not claim that
labor has been arbitrary and unfair. I am not
opposed to labor unions per se, but I am
against them as they are now constitute*.
Labcr unions will not succeed as the trusts
have not succeeded oa the principle of limit
ing Consolidation for economy's
sake, fair wages, purchasing in the cheapest
market and sellins in the best, are the trade
principles that will stand. The labor
unions have . become trusts. After all,
the fortunes and the prosperity , of the
employer and the employed are linked to
gether; they are the same and the two inter
ests should stand together. I am willing to
come here and give you any practical ideas
that I can and I hope this conference will
come to some good. â¢
Senator Hanna expressed strong ap
proval of the principles of organized la
bor, and his speech drew apologies from
John Phillips and John J. Donnelly, two
of the labor delegates, who confessed thai
they had held erroneous and unjust view*
as to the attitude of the Senator toward
organized labor. Senator Hanna related
an experience he had with coal miners In
Ohio many years ago, and said that the
experience had made trim an advocate of
unionism. He said:
I saw then and I believe now that labor and
capital could be brought together. I believe
that the day is at hand for their peace, and I
am willing to give the best there is in me
white life lasts to bring labor and capital to-
Eether. - A settlement of the question wjll do
more for good government, good morals, good
social relations than anythinc else that we
eould accomplish. To the â  end of all this I
freely give whatever service I can render to
. the association. -
Archbishop Ireland Gives His Views.
Bishop Potter asserted that the restora
tion of human interest to the relation of
labor and capital, the establishment of
contact between the two. bringing them
so close that they might see each other'3
position, would go far toward settling the
differences between them. He said that
ideas and practical work were needed to
bring the result which both desired.
Archbishop Ireland said that all Europe
looked to the United States to heal the
breach between the two great interests.
As a minister of religion, as a member of
a church whose pontiff had declared that
the most important duty of the church
was to maintain peace between labor and
capital, he was present to do his duty In
a movement that made for peace, har
mony and brotherhood among men. He
believed, he said, that the realization of
what Americans owed to one another as
men and children of God was needed to
bring those opposed together. He ap
proved the idea of creating some channel
for an exchange of ideas and the mutual
flow of the feeling of brotherhood.
Joseph Phillips and John J. Donnelly,
the latter of the New York Bricklayers*
Union, recorded their approval . of the
principle of arbitration and conciliation,
and asserted that for years the hatters
and bricklayers in New York had main
tained satisfactory relations with the men
â who employed them.

His Stead.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CLARA, Dec. 16.â Santa Clara
was thrown into excitement this after
noon by the removal from office of Post
master A. A. Withrow by United States
Inspector McCardly of San Francisco. An
examination by that official into the af
fairs of the oflice to-day disclosed a num
ber of irregularities and he at once noti
fied Withrow*s bondsmenâ H. A. Alder
man, George Norwood, George Roth, Al
bert Harris, A. R. Woodhams, Captain
Morrison and Charles Jackson. They held
a meeting immediately and withdrew
from Withrow' s bonds.
It is not believed there is a defalcation,
but the exact cause of removal has not
yet been made â  public. Miss Llllie Bill
ings, deputy postmaster, was placed in
charge of the office by the inspector and
the former sureties of Withrow went on
her bond.
Withrow said to-night that he placed
his resignation in the hands of the In
spector because of his age. Being up
ward of 70, the duties of the oflice were
more than he could attend to. His term
of office would have expired next April.
Withrow is one of the most prominent
citizens of Santa Clara. He has been a
resident of the town for a half century.
In the civil war he was a member of the
famous "California Hundred."

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 16.â The Lewis

Lave issued a statement outlining the
plans for the centennial celebration to be

posed to arrange, the address gives the
following preamble and resolutions as
adopted by the commissioners:
Whereas, The exploration of the Northwest
Territory by Lewis and Clark in the years
1804, 1805 and 1S06 was one of the most im
portant events In tho history of 'our country,
since It led to the extension of the sovereignty
of the United States to the Pacific, save the
nation the Orejron country, now the seat of
many States, and paved the way to the acquis
ition of California and Alaska, therefore, it Is
the senss of the respective commissioners of
the various States here represented that this
important and memorable exploration should
be properly celebrated in 1905 as the Lewis and
Clark centennial, and be it

WOTJTJ) CHECK SLAUGHTER
OF DEEE IN AT.AfitTA
TACOMA, Dec. 16.â George Simmons, a
San Francisco fur dealerÂ»who visits Alas
ka every season. Is heading a movement
having for its object the protection of the
deer of Alaska from butchery by hunters,
who take only the skins, leaving the car
casses to decay. Simmons declares that
if this continues deer will become very
scarce throughout the more settled por
tions of Alaska. He wants Congress to
pass a law prohibiting the exportation of
deerskins from the Territory. At some
seasons deer hides sell for only 30 cents
each, but even at that price the Indians
slaughter the animals in great numbers.
While Simmons was at Wrangel recently
two Indians came in with 400 skins of
deer which they had killed in less than a
month.
Simmons has interested Congressman
Kahn of California and Congressman Sul
zer of New York In the proposed law and
on his recent trip obtained a letter from
Governor Brady, indorsing his plan. Thii
letter will be forwarded to Congressman
Kahn. With this start, it is believed
there will be little difSculty in getting
the desired measure through - Congress.
"Without such a law prospectors will not
long be able to depend upon deer meat as
one of their means of sustenance.

MORE LYNCHERS
TO BE INDITED
Grand Jury of Modoc
County Is Again in
Session.
Fresno Witnesses Testify in
' the Trial of James W.
Brown.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
ALTURAS. Dec 16.â For the seventh
time since the lynching of the Halls, Mar
tin and Yantla In Lookout last May the
grand Jury of Modoc County is in session.
Deputy Attorney General Post was before
the jury during the forenoon, and it is
said that several additional indictments
against alleged lynchers will be returned.
Rumor has it that Justice of the Peace
Myers who, according to one witness, was
seen testing rope In a Lookout store and
making hangman's loops in it. Is among
those slated for indictment. Owing to
Post being engaged in this direction there
was no session of the Superior Court this
forenoon. In the afternoon the defense
had an inning, being permitted to call
five witnesses from, Fresno, who were sub
penaed to testify to the good character of
the defendant. James W. Brown. Each.
regarded Brown as a man remarkable for
his lofty integrity and respect for the
law.
Frank Burley said that he met Brown
in Fresno in 1886. Brown, was then work-
Ing in Fresno and was well known there.
His general reputation was excellent and
the people in that community said of him
that he was an upright, honest man. Ha
had never heard of Brown being quarrel
some or in trouble and had always heard
him spoken of as a good citizen.
An objection to evidence regarding the
defendant's character since the lynching
was sustained and during the argument
by Baker, for the defense, the Jury was
sent from the courtroom.
W.itt Holm said that he had known
Brown continuously from 18S6 to 1803.
Brown's reputation for honesty and in
tegrity was good. When the witness first
knew Brown he brought a horse to Fresno
to sell and ' afterward he conducted, a
butcher shop. Every time the defendant
was spoken of in Fresno it was in the
highest terms as to his reputation.
C. A. Brown knew the defendant from
18S6 to 1893. He said that Brown was in
business with him for a time. Brown's
reputation was good. Al Steven, a. broth
er of C. A. Steven, said that he had known
the defendant and that his reputation was
of the best. T. W. Chapman gave similar
testimony.
Four other -witnesses at Grants Pass
have been subpenaed and -will probably
be here in a day or two.
INVESTIGATING- ATTEMPT
TO KILL AIX>LPH SYLVA
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 16.â Sheriff Taylor
went to Sausalito this afternoon to in
vestigate the attempted blowing up of
Adolph Sylva's house on Friday night.
The small pieces of metal found near the
place where the explosion occurred have
been identified as the fragments of an
electric battery. Small pieces of paper
and gunnysack were also found. It ap
pears that the battery and explosive -were
wrapped in paper and a sack at the time
the bomb was fired.
The affair is shrouded In mystery and
as yet the officers have been unable to
fasten the crime upon any one. Some are
inclined to the belief that it was only an
attempt to frighten Sylva and tlius get
him to change his attitude in local poli
tics.

CONDEMN WATER
OF LOBOS CREEK
Resolution Unanimously
Adopted by the
Supervisors.
Co3t of Single-Pipe-Line Prom
the Tuolumne to Be
Estimated.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the resolution â¢ condemning the
water of Point Lobos Creek as a menace
to public health and ordering the Spring
Valley Water Company to discontinue
supplying it to consumers.
D'Ancona in urging the adoption of the
resolution said. that the burden of proof
was on the Spring Valley Company to
show that the water had been purified by
effective nitration. , The Supervisor said
that if experts should find after an exam
ination extending over a period . of one
year that the water could be made hy
gienically pure in that time then the reso
lution could afterward be rescinded.
Reed exhibited a map prepared by the
City Engineer showing- that the drainage
area, of Lobos Creek was contaminated
by sewage and bacteria. M. H. Garoutte,
attorney for the water company, ex
plained that the water in the same drain
age area was being used by the Alms
house inmates. Garoutte asked that ac
tion be postponed until further analyses
could be made. Dr. D'Ancona argued that
the favorable "analysis made by Pro
fessor Hllgard was too superficial and not
long enough extended to make it of value.
Chief Engineer Schussler of the Spring
Valley Water Company notified the board
by letter that water would not be pumped
from Lobos Creek during this, and next
months, and petitioned that additional
analyses be made.
Sohussler asks that Professor Stillroan
of Stanford University make the chemical
analysis and Dr. Moffatt of this city the
bacteriological analysis.
The Board of Works and the City En
gineer were requested to furnish an esti
mate of the cost of the construction and
completion of a single pipe line, with a
capacity of 40,000,000 gallons of water per
day. having the Tuolumne River as a
source of supply. The estimate is to fol
low out the details of construction recom
mended In .the report of the City En
gineer on a water supply for San Fran
cisco. The City Engineer is also to con
sider the Dumbarton Land Company's
proposition to furnish water from the
Alameda artesian well belt as a subsidi
ary reservoir supply.
The Police â  Commission notified the
board that the charter permits five cap
tains and ten lieutenants in the depart
ment, and that there are three, captains
and six lieutenants. The vacancies in the
ranks of captains will be lllled by the
Civil Service Commission, and the maxi
mum number of lieutenants allowed by
the charter will be employed when pro
vision is made by the Supervisors for
their payment. . - -*
A resolution was adopted directing the
Board of Works to require of- the eity
architect that he devote his time exclu
sively to the service of the city and coun
ty. The resolution recites that if the city
architect engages in private w.ork he may
grant himself permits to alter or erect
building?, which is held to be against pub
lic policy.

SPLENDID GIFT

Mayor Phelkn Presents
Branch Library to
ttie City. .
Mayor James D.Phelan' formally pre
sented to the city last night the branch
library building which he has had erected
at the corner of Fourth, and Clara streets.
The presentation ceremony was appropri
ately short and stripped of all unneces
sary forms. It was held In the spacious
reading-room- of the library in the pres
ence of representatives- of the > Board of
Supervisors, the Board of Education, the
Board of Library Trustees, Mayor-elect
Schraitz and many other prominent citi
zens. In jfiving the handsome structure
to the city . the Mayor, made a short
speech, in which he described the pur
poses of the branch library'. The gift was
accepted on behalf of the city by Dr. Ed
ward R. Taylor, president of the Board of
Library Trustees. > .
Mayor Phelan said that the idea of mak
ing a gift to the city first occurred to him
two years ago about Christmas. time. He
was for a time puzzled as to what his
gift should be, but filially decided that a
library would be best appreciated and
would prove the most beneficial in .the
education of the public. ' H,e described the
growth of the public library and the part
which it had played in the advancement
of the people. ,"
In accepting the gift Dr. Taylor said
that it afforded him great pleasure as a
representative of the Library Trustees
and of the city in general to accept the
magnificent building from one who had
already given so much of his thought and
so much of his substance to San Fran
cisco. He said that he hoped that the
library would be taken as a model in the
construction of other libraries. He de
clared that Mayor Phelan's gift was justl-.
fled in the fact that" the ; people of that
section of the city had shown that ; they
appreciated Bood : literature. . ...
The ceremonv was concluded by a f ew
appropriate remarks from Mayor-elect
Schmitz, who said that he was proud both
as a public spirited citizen, and as Mayor
elect to be present at the presentation.
He said that education is the foundation
of all good government. .

EXCHANGE WILL
BUY MORE LAND
Votes for Purchase of
Old' Pacific Board
Site.
The Merchants' Exchange' directors
voted yesterday to purchase the old Pa
cific Stock Exchange property, with front
age upon Montgomery , and ' Leidesdorlf
streets, for. the agreed price of $150,000.
With the property of the old Merchants'
â¢Exchange upon California and Leidesdorlf
streets, previously. acquired, the added
property on Montgomery and Leidesdorff
streets will give three large frontages and
provide' for three entrances upon the three
streets named. ' .
This action finally takes out of exist-;
ence an institution which was. the scene
of much excitement in the; days of wild
mining.. Leidesdorff â¢ street acquired â  the
name- of "Pauper alley,". on account of
the number of . speculators that "went
broke" \ after trying their ..V. luck in the.
board. That was > the. theater of action
of the famous "mud hens,", women who
haunted the galleries whenever the board
was in session year in 'and year out.
After- the Pacific Stock Exchange had
gone into decadence as the result of the
decline of the Comstock' mines the- old
board room was little used for -a. time.
Then the rise of the California petroleum
excitement gave new life. The front of
the building was repainted and was brave
with the name of a new' petroleum ex
change. There, were ceremonies -at the
opening and speeches. But the great pro
ductivity of the Kern River district oil
wells and the low prices that resulted
from the:rush of all? the owners to mar
ket their oil at any price. they could get
destroyed- the. chance that. there would.be
many dividend paying companies for .. . a
time, until conditions could be readjusted.
Again. the exchange fell into disuse. Tbe
first time it .failed because of a scarcity
of .the product upon which its speculative
market, was .based;' the, second ' time â  it
failed for. the opposite reason, because of
the plethora., â¢ ,. â¢-..â â -: â â â â¢,-. â {. â¢.-.â 
The Merchants* Exchange 'will erect a
fine building on the two large sites and
all the commercial bodies of the city and
kindred organizations will be invited to be
housed therein. â  *3kÂ£igfiÂ£k3f:'.

The complaining witness against them
is Mrs. Rose Kilbourn of Santa Rosa, at

Rofa, where Kilbourn is a real estate
dealer, on a visit. Sunday evening Mrs.

After leaving the car Mrs. Kilbourn lost

home she told Mrs. Morrissey of her ex
perience, and later in the evening Frank
Morrissey, a son of Mrs.- Morrissey, and
Crouch,- who was present", offered to go
with her to find her hat. Not suspecting
any violence, she readily accompanied
them, and they were joined -by Flynn.
When they reached' â  a barn owned by
Jeremiah Sullivari' on French street, off
the Mission road, the three men dragged
Mrs. Kilbourn into the barn, threw her

STREET BRIDGE5
MAY BE ERECTED
Lane Says Charter Does
Not Forbid Special
Permits.
Chief of Police Will Arrest
Violators of the High
Fence Law.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday with the Board of Supervisors to
the effect that there Is nothing in the law
which prevents the Board of Supervisors
from granting a special permit to build
a bridge across a street. The opinion of
the City Attorney, which is Interesting
from the fact that it modifies the strict
limitation of the charter concerning pub
lic encroachments, follows: Â»
I do not take it to have been intended by the
charter that the city could not authorize the
use of an awning extending over the sidewalk
or of a bay-window cr cornice or a sign at
such height above the sidewalk as to be of no
possible hindrance tÂ» public travel or impair
the use of the street as a public highway. A
permanent encroachment is not .to be permitted
by the Board of Public Works of any structure
upon the sidewalk. â¢
This does not certainly mean that the clt>
has no power to permit the use of a portion of
the space under the sidewalk (which in law is
city property when the fee is in the city) or
of a portion of the space in the unoccupied
and untraveled space above the sidewalk, or
course it is within the power of the Super
visors to regulate or prohibit such extensions
over the sidewalk, but that the charter denies
to the Supervisors any power to permit such a
limited use of the street or sidewalk is nowhere
expressed. .
It must also be understood that any such
use is but a license revocable at the pleasure of
the city, and no right to more than a tempo
rary use whatever arise under permits so
granted.
In conformity with the opinion the or
dinance granting the Chutes Company a
permit to construct a bridge over Tenth
avenue, between C and Fulton, streets,
was passed to print.
A resolution was adopted directing the
Chief of Police to cause the arrest of any
person violating the provisions of the or
dinance limiting the height of fences to
ten feet and to prosecute the cases to a
conclusion.
The resolution directing the Board of
Works to require all owners of houses,
sheds, buildings and obstructions of every
kind now upon Third and Berry streets to
remove the same from the roadway with
in sixty days was deferred one week. At
torney "W. F. Humphrey, representing the
South End Rowing Club, addressed the
board in opposition to the passage of the
resolution, claiming that the Harbor Com
missioners had given the club permission
to occupy its premises, which were said
to be an obstruction to the street.
The board passed to print an ordinance
changing the classification of a clerkship
to that of a deputyship in the Auditor's
office. Action was taken on recommenda
tion of the Mayor, who informed the
board that a legal point has beeh raised
as to the validity of certificates of re
demption of real estate purchased by the
State, which are now signed by a clerk
instead of a deputy. Auditor Wells ex
plained that it was only by special per
mission of the State Controller that the
redemption clerk has heretofore signed
the certificates.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE, Dec 16.â The dormitory >iris
at the university held an exclusive mask
ball on Saturday evening. During a cake
walk one of the girls chanced to glance
<i^m at the feet of the couple Just before
h<J, and in an Instant became satisfied
that the owners of those feet were not
girls. The pedal extremities were too
large, the soles of the shoes were too
thick and the actions of the dancers be
cpoke all too plainly the masculine. *
As the suspicious couple again circled
the hall and passed her at the lower end
ehe made a determined grab. Her femi
nine fingers closed around a wig. There
was a quick jerk and wig, false face and
Â£.11 came off with a clatter. As the wig
disappeared the short cropped head of a
boy came into view.
Hastily running down the long hallway,
the boys reached the front door. They
grasped the knob and gave a quick, strong
pull. It was locked. They turned to start
back along the hallway, when they came
face to face with a mob of femininity.
They stopped, of course. There was then
but one alternative and the boys took it.
"We've got to do it, old man," said one
of them.
Ducking his head and covering his face
with his arms, he gave one flying leap.
There was a crash, followed by the sound
of a heavy fall as boy, glass and window
sash disappeared Into the night. The first
crash was followed almost instantly by
another, as the second lad made a flying
leap through a window.
It was a desperate chance to take, but
the boys took it. As a consequence there
is much speculation among the girls as
to who the Intruders were. The girls all
vowed to keep it quiet, but they also
agreed to watch the hands and face of
every boy they knew to ascertain which
ores were cut by broken glass.

DAWSON MAIL
SINKS IN LAKE
Carrier and His Team
Go Through the Ice
on Le Barge.
Several Water-Soaked Sacks
.Are Recovered^ but the
' Balance Are Lost.
Special Dispatch. to The Call.
B. C. Dec. 16.-Northern
malls which arrived this morning by the
steamer Cottage City were much reduced
from the amount that left Daw son for
the outside, and what few sacks did come
were in a dilapidated condition. While
they were being brought across Lake Le
Barge In a sleigh, with a double team of
horses attached, the newly frozen ice
broke through. The entire consignment
was soaked with , water and nearly half
of the sacks were lost. The horses were
drowned and the driver nearly lost his
life. He went ashore and obtained help,
and one by one several of the mall sacks
were fished out.
The Christmas mail was coming-out and
a good portion of it is now at the bottom
of the lake. When the Cottage City re
ceived them the water soaked sacks were
a solid cake of ice.
Only a \ few passengers came " over the
ice from Dawson and they found the go
ing very rough.
Two Juneau men will travel 2000 miles
each with dog teams this winter carrying
the United States mails between Katmal
and St. Michael. They are Chauncey D.
Shaw, who has resigned as associate ed
itor of the Juneau Mining Record to un
dertake this dangerous work, and John
Carter, an experienced frontiersman. Car
ter left here some time ago for St. Mi
chael, with the expectation of starting
from there for Katmal about D2cembar 10.
Shaw left Juneau ten days ago for Val
des, 'whence he will take dogs and sleds
aboard the steamer Discovery for Kat
mal. It will take him twenty-eight days
to reach St Michael. From Katmai he
will be accompanied by native Indian
guides. They expect to reach St. Michael
early in January.
Each carrier will make one round trip
and. then return to the other end of the
route, thus giving -him three trips each
wayâ one each in December, January and
February.
MISS IVES A -WINNER
ON PRESIDIO LINKS
Captures Trophy Offered by Direct
ors of San Francisco Golf Club
for Driving Contest..
On account of the rapid approach of
Christmas not many ladles are to be seen
on the Presidio links. The driving com
petition for lady members of the San
Francisco Golf Club yesterday morning
attracted only . four entries, though a
handsome cup was offered by the direct
ors for the winner. Each contestant drove
four balls from the teeing ground toward
the bunker, the total distance of the four
drives being added together. Miss Flor
ence Ives won with a total of 404 yards,
Mrs. B, Gilman Brown being second with
a total of 403 yards. Miss Edith McBean
and Mrs. Laurance T. Scott also com
peted. A strong north wind interfered
considerably with the driving, the' strokes
being made right in the teeth of it.
The ladles will hold no more competi
tions during the present year, but early
in the new year a contest for the Coun
cil's cup for ladies will take place.

WATERCURE SCORES AT SCANT ODDS,
BEATING VESUVIAN AND THE PRIDE
rv ' .nil if* in f% ii " i â¢ " ' f\ i xl L iL
Ring at Oakland Partially Recoups Its Losses of Last Saturday Through the
v:| Victories of Several Outsiders----Jpsie G Qowris Botany in a Furious
Drive-El Oriente, a 25 to I Shot, Finishes in Front of Old Wyoming
/ f^s. WNER GREEN MORRIS' cham
fi \| plon, Watercure, picked up a llt
il II tie more easy money at Oakland
yesterday. â¢ It met Vesuvian
'â  and The Pride on nearly equal
terms at' six and one-half furlongs
and it was scarcely a good workout for
the Watercress gelding. Winnie O'Connor
had the mount and for two-thirds of the
journey Mounce and Johnny Woods had
him in a pocket. Not the least bit per
turt>ed Winnie gradually took the favorite
up below the eighth pole and slid along on
the outside without ever tickling the riljs
of Watercure with his heels, Vesuvian dis
playing a keen turn of speed, v
With two exceptions the results of the
different races proved ' "eagle-birds" for
the ring, which no doubt recouped its
losses of Saturday last. Mont . Eagle,
Josie G, Plohn and finally Kl Oriente, a
25 to 1 shot, were the four bonbons popped
â¢with saddening effect on the talent.
It has all along been' * conceded that
Josie G was a spanking good filly, but
yesterday it was scarcely thought she
could lower the colors tt Botany, Then
again Howson, who rides her, is not such
a polished horseman as some of the
otl?er boys. For this reason Botany, pilot
ed by Bullman, closed favorite at 9 to 5,
while 7 to 2 could be had in profusion
about Josie G. Glendenning, the stanch
second choice, -went out to make the pace
at the start, trailed by ' the favorite.
Turning into the stretch Howson saved
ground with Josie G and soon had Bull
man hustling Botany along, Glendenning
having fallen back beaten. Finishing on
the rail Josie G seemed fittest and stowed
the favorite away by a*heck. The Futuri
ty course was covered in 1:10, an excellent
run. â : â â ^: ,..-.â¢ .. . â¢â â .â : v r
Owen Mounce came very near taking
matters too easy with Frank Bell in the
introductory five and a half furlong dash.
The son of. Big Henry closed, a 1 to 4
chance, and at the finish had to be ridden
out to get the decision from The Miller
by a head. Ransch took the show with
Pompino.' ...
Big things were expected of Harry Sto
ver's Free Lance in the mile and a ! six
teenth selling affair, simply because he
was meeting a very cheap batch of plat
ers. The chestnut horse closed favorite,
and ran unplaced. Mont Eagle, a 12 to 1
shot, ridden by Ransch, made all the run
ning and in a drive downed Ulm a neck.
Mounce made a late move with the latter,
or he would have won.
Bullman seems able to get more speed
out of Plohn than any of the other riders.
P. Ryan's entry went to the post a 9 to 1
chance for the seven-furlong -number and
in a drive overtook and downed Duckoy
half a length. Lee Jackson, on the fa
vorite Native, tried to run through a gas
pine and climb one or two kopjes in the
stretch, and getting repulsed in all three
attempts, finished. third.
El Oriente from the Baldwin stable, and
20 and 25 to 1 in the betting, made a run
away race of the final mile and a six
teenth run. Jackson, on Wyoming, the
favorite, did manage to beat Merops for
the place. -Vv?
Track Notes.
Among the big winners in the ring was
George Rose, whose sheets showed; a
clean-up of over $4500. t
Roscoe Troxler, an extremely clever boy
In the saddle, will arrive at Oakland next
Friday. He comes under engagement to
"W. W. Elliott, owner of Hilee and other
horses.
Joseph Flynn received word from Texas
yesterday that his brother Willie died
last week at St. Joseph's Infirmary, Hous
ton, of pneumonia. The deceased Jockey
had been riding over the Texas circuit
the past season, but was well known in
this State, at one time promising to de
velop into a star
When Lee Jackson first showed at Oak
land he rode two or three very creditable
races. However, with one or two more
exhibitions like those on Native and Wy
oming, - these â ' former efforts will be put
down as jokes, and Lee willbe relegated
to the stable boy class.
The first hurdle race of the season will
be given at the track over the bay this
afternooh. Good things will ripen faster
now than strawberries in July. ;
Dick Dwyer handled the starting gate
at Oakland- yesterday, Jake Holtman re

MISSING COUPLE
ARE HEARD FROM

Home/of Bakersfield
Â£31opers.
Special Dispatch to The . Call.
WOODLAND, Dec. 16.â Relatives of Miss
Belle Kline, the Bakersfleld girl who, r in
company with William. Martin,- disap- .
peared from that, city, on November. 22,
need have no further misgivings as -.to
her safety. Both of the young persons
are still alive. They are now husband and
wife and are living in Los Angeles. â¢ â 
â  it - was announced here recently that
Benjamin A. Martin, a brother of the
missing man, had received a letter from
the latter, announcing his marriage to
Miss Kline, and this publication ; quieted
the fears of the young lady's parents.' But
it was announced from the KernCbunty
Sheriff's office on Saturday that a' letter
had been received from. Benjamin 'â¢ A.
Martin asking for information regarding
the whereabouts of his brother, 1 this indi
cating that the Woodland man. had not
received the reported- news from. Los An-'
geles. To-day. Benjamin A. Martin ex
plained this and declared that .there need
be no further fear , that the missing
Bakersfield couple ' were'- not . among the
â¢living. He said the letter he. wrote- to
the Kern â¢ Sheriff -asking for- information
was mailed before -he had heard from. his
brother. The missive from Los Angeles
came as was reported and conveyed the
information . that i William Martin - and
Miss Kline ' had -, married â  after leaving
Bakersfield and were living in Los > An
geles. â¢ â â¢-.â ..;- â¢ .. . .
The- elopers gave no reason for their
strange move, and. as .there was no, op
position to their wedding, on the part of
relatives, their conduct Is inexplicable.
For weeks the Kern County authorities
have conducted a diligent search . for
them, and the- fear : that they, were not
among the living has been constantly
growing.

NEVADA TO FACE
MICHIGAN TEAM
Football OontestÂ»for San
Francisco on Christ
mas Day.
Mountaineers "Will Attempt
to Defeat the Men
From the East
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 16.â
According to . a â  personal letter received
from Reno. -Nevada, by a Stanford stu
dent, a football game In San . Francisco
on Christmas day between the eleven
from the University of Michigan and the
Nevada State "University ' team is a cer
tainty..
Michigan had challenged Nevada to a
game on that day, and the sagebrush ag
gregation â  seemed willing to meet them.
The challenge had not Deen accepted at
the time the letter was written, dut the
writer said it would be forthwith. The
is'evadans realize that they are going
against a hard proposition, but they nave
dune so before and acquitted themselves
creditably.
Nevada .has played' both' Stanford and
California this season, beirg defeated In
each game by. the score. of 12 to 0, after
a hard-fought struggle. Her principal
victory was over the Kellance eleven by
a score of 11 to 0. The sagebrush eleven
also defeated the University of Utah
team, scoring points to their oppo
nents' 2. . . :
Among the Nevada players, Riordan at
tackle has played a star game all through
the season, doing as tine work at his po
sition as -has been seen on the coast;
Hunter at center and and Gra
ham behind the line play straight, hard
'varsity ball. : â 
The personnel of the cardinal eleven,
as it will -line '.up .against Michigan in
Pasadena, will not be announced by Cap
tain Fisher until Thursday, the day be
fore the squad leaves for Southern Cali
fornia. One -thing is certain â there will
be several \changes to the llnerup as it
met California. . Traeger .and Hill are
both on the sick list and It seems improb
able that they, will be in shape to play
against the men from the Middle West.
Chester Naramore, varsity hurdler and
half-back on* last year's strong second
eleven team; will go south with the team
and will probably" appear behind the line.
Naramore has not been seen on the grid
iron before this season, owing to the fact
that his left arm was fractured by a fall
during a hurdle race in the intercollegiate
meet last spring. Alex McGllvray, '04,
is making' his initial appearance in the
field. . McGllvray is -a remarkably fast,
heady player and probably will appear at
end during the game. I
! Joseph de t orest, "Bate" Burnett and
Tom McFadden, former varsity players,
will not be in the line-up against Michi
gan. '-'[â¢ .
Captain ; Fisher and twenty other foot
ball players are going through nightly
practice at tackling the "dummy," catch
ing the ball and running through signals.
The men are entering into the work with
the proper ! spirit and should be In good
condition to put up a hard game on New
Year's day. Strict' training rules are be
ing enforced and violation of them means
expulsion from the squad.

STOCKTON.Dec. 16.â Charles Merrill of
the Stockton Rifle and Pistol Club tied

Edward Covey Murders
Henry Taylor in
. JOamptonville.
"Witness of Tragedy Falls in a
Fit of Apoplexy and
May Die.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE. Dec. 16.â Whisky tugged
at the trigger of a rifle in the hands of
Edward Covey in Camptonville this
afternoon, and as a result Henry Taylor
is dead and his slayer under arrest for
murder. The tragedy took place In a
saloon conducted by O. G. Mayo. Ac
cording to the reports received here there
was no excuse for the murder. Mid it
was simply the wanton act of a drunken
man.
A peculiar Incident in connection with
the affair is that Mayo, In whose place
the shooting took place, was so overcome
by excitement that he fell in a nt of
apoplexy and has not regained conscious
ness. It is believed he will not recover.
Camptonville Is a mining town forty
four miles northeastVof this city. Tay
lor was a well-known young man of the
town. Covey is about the same age as
his victim' and resides with his mother.
Both young men have borne excellent rep
utations, and the shooting has created
intense excitement. Covey's weapon was
a rifle of large caliber.
Sheriff Bevan and Coroner Hopkins
have left for Camptonville.
DETROIT, Dec. 16. â Two men were kllle*
and another was severely injured at Defray, a
suburb of Detroit, early to-day by a. Lak*
Shore passenger train.

IRRIGATION LAWS.
ONE of the most serious problems the Ameri
can people will have to solve in undertaking
to provide irrigation for the arid and semi
ana lands will be that of devising proper irrigation
laws and putting them into effect without doing in
jury to existing rights or involving thousands of set
tlers in vexatious and costly law suits. That fact is
â¢emphasized in the report of the Secretary of Agricul
ture, and it will have to be carefully considered in
devising any comprehensive and scientific scheme of
irrigation either by Congress or by State Legisla : .
The confusion of oui irrigation laws is due to the
fact that the Western States and Territories have
been settled by people from the East, who brought
with them the ideas which have prevailed among
Anglo-Saxons from time immemorial concerning
riparian lights. The old customs and laws were ex
cellently adapted to conditions which prevail in Great
Britain and in trie Eastern and Southern States,
where there is an abundance of streams and nearly
always ample rainfall at all seasons of the year. They
are utterly unfitted, however, for arid countries and
their application here and in the West generally has
been hurtful.
Defective as the irrigation laws are in many ways,
and injurious as they arc in almost every way, large
vested interests have been acquired under them and
'they cannot be lightly set aside. In his report the
Secretary of Agricultuie says: "It must be borne in
mind that we are not at the beginning of irrigation
development. Over $200,000,000 of private capital
has already been invested in'the construction of irri
gation works. The rights to streams already acquired
represent many additional millions. The methods
and customs by which these properties are operated
and rights to streams established are the', results of
an tvojution local in character; hence they' differ
widely in different States. An illustration of the sit
uation which prevails is furnished by the South Platte
River and its tributaries in Colorado. There are over
a fhousand separate and distinct; rights to the waters
of this stream. Some of these rights serve to irrigate
over a hundred farms. * * * Such a division
is a complex and difficult problem. It has required
nearly a half century, for the people of the section to
solve it and devise a working- system. * - * *
It is a question whether any appropriation which
Congress might make for the construction of addi
tional works :n this district would not inflict more
injury than benefit if such construction carried with
it any disturbance or interference with the existing
system."
Furthermore, the Secretary says:, "If the States are
to control the water supplies there should be satisfac
tory assurance that ' whatever is made available by
public funds should benefit the actual users of water
and not enrich the holders of speculative rights. In
some States there is such assurance. Those States
are entitled to national aid, because it is known from
present conditions that such aid would be clearly
beneficial. But there are other arid States where -the
doctrine of riparian rights jeopardizes the success of
every irrigation work now built 'as well as any works
the Government might build. * * * Whatever
aid Congress extends should be conditioned on the
enactment of proper irrigation codes by the States
and be made to promote the -greater efficiency and
success of such laws rather than interfere with their
operation."
As these views pf the Secretary of Agriculture are
founded upon reason and justice it is probable they
will prevail whenever any attempt is made at provid
ing national aid to State irrigation. Consequently
it bejjooves the people of the different States to begin
thinking how they can best devise an irrigation code
which will stand the test which the Secretary recom
mends.
Eastern reports promise us that this is to be a rec
ord year for tourist travel to California, and* it may
also prove to be a record 'year for settlers. jAVelike
to have- them come,' but "we. like them' better when
Ihey invest and stay withes.' â  \ -,'â¢
MARCONI'S TRIUMPH.
BY working : in secret, swiftly and scientifically,
Sighor Marconi has succeeded in surprising
the world with a, wireless telegraph signal
across the ocean from England to Newfoundland -at
a time when the world was expecting nothing more
than attempt to communicate from land with a
ship more than ioo miles at sea. The feat has been
in the fullest sense a startling one and finishes up the
first year of the new century with one of the greatest
marvels ever achieved by. science and invention.
The transmission of the signals which in the.tele
graphic alphabet correspond to the letter S are suffi
cient to assure the transmission of messages in the
near future. The apparatus with which Marconi
made his experiment was in one respect jdefective.
He had on the Newfoundland coast no tower high
enough to enable him to intercept the subtle vibra
tions sent forth from the English station. The use
of a balloon was not feasible owing to the severity
of the winter winds on triat stormy coait. He was;
therefore, .compelled to' make use of a kite, which
proved sufficient indeed for the success of' the ex
periment, but would be utterly inadequate for the
practical working of the system- as a regular medium
for the transmission of news.
In speaking of the experiments to a correspondent
of The Call, Marconi said: "It must be remembered
my kite was; flying about in all directions. The sig
nal was received only when the kite was at a great
height. My opinion is that a station here similar to
that at The Lizard, on the Cornwall coast v with spe
cial machinery* and a mast 200 feet high, will be quite
sufficient to make powerful communication across
the Atlantic. I do not expect to obtain further great
results from the kite tests and must wait until a mast
is erected." ".ââ  â  ,
' The construction of the required station on this
side of the ocean will not require much time, nor will
it be difficult for the inventor to obtain the* money
needed for the plant. His system of telegraphy is no
longer an experiment. Capitalists recognize it as
good business and are willing to back him for a far
larger sum than the proposed plant will cost. We
are, therefore, /"within measurable distance of a time
when we may expect wireless telegraphy across the
ocean to be an established system for the transmis
sion of messages. How far the new telegraphy will
affect the old cable companies it is impossible to say;
but it seems certain they will have a keen competition
to meet even if they do not have to succumb alto
gether..
Incidentally among his other triumphs, Marconi
may count the victory his latest achievement has ob*
tained for him over the yellow journal that a few years
ago derided him and mocked at his works. It will
be remembered that when The Call accomplished the
feat of transmitting by wireless telegraphy the news
of the arrival off the Golden Gate of the transport
bringing home the California Volunteers," the Exam
iner scoffed at the feat and tried hard to induce the
public" to look upon it as a fake. Later on when, in
connection with the New York Herald, The Call ob
tained by wireless telegraphy reports of the interna
tional yacht race off New York harbor, the Exam
iner returned to its attacks. Not content with assail- 1 *
ing The Call, it sneered at the inventor, styled him'
['Macaroni," and in other ways sneered and jeered
at him. All is changed now. The Examiner gives
:tts front page and biggest type to the achievements
of the marvelous inventor. It has ceased to call him
"Macaroni." Perhaps in the end it may even try to
claim for itself the credit of introducing wireless
telegraphy on this coast and making use of it in trans
mitting news.
. Chicago ;complains of a lack of young women for
service in'.tiie dry goods stores and Boston complains
of a shortage of marriageable young women among
the first families; so it would seem matrimony has had
a boom in the East.
THE PEACE OF THE WORLD.
WHEN upon Christmas day the civilized na
tions sing the anthem of "Peace on Earth,"
Â£ they will have to gather enthusiasm for the
singing from faith alone. There is no peace in South
Africa, China, the Philippines or South America, and
even among the nations which are at peace with one
another there is no confidence except that which re
poses in armies and navies. Moreover, the outlook is
anything but promising for the continuance of such
peace as exists. Politically, the world is in a condi
tion of unstable equilibrium and there is no telling
when something may set it moving in the direction
of war.
In South" America there is a condition that menaces
all kinds of conflicts. It is not merely that Vene
zuela, and Colombia are at dagger points, and that
Argentina and Chile are ready to fight, but the Vene
zuelan situation threatens to involve Germany and
the United States in a controversy that will be any
thing but good naturcd. Moreover, Germany is not
content to enforce her claims upon Venezuela before
undertaking new military and naval enterprises, and is
reported to be interfering with Japan in Korea, while
Japan and Great Britain are said to be busily at work
in China trying to prevent Russia from getting con
trol of Manchuria.. The result! is, we are sending
warships to watch Germany, Germany is moving a
force to watch Japan, and Great Britain is watching
Russia. \ > ,
Of all these controversies that between the Ger
mans and the Venezuelans is the most' interesting to
us. That Germany's claims are valid seems to be
conceded, but President Castro has announced that;
he docs not consider his Government bound to rem
edy wrongs done by former Governments. Germany
threatens to seize a Venezuelan port and collect cus-,
toms enough to satisfy the claims and the cost of coir
lection. Castro says if that course be followed he will
proclaim free trade and no goods will pass through
the custom-houses the Germans may have seized.
He adds that by way of a compromise he will give
the Germans a right to colonize a large tract of Ven

crnment that the dispatch of German war?, vessels, to
Venezuelan waters has no ulterior object, f The^ Czar
has doubtless informed the British that his movement
in Manchuria has no ulterior object. In fact,; the na
tions seem to.be living just now without ulterior ob
ject. Whether this is a good and healthful condition
of world politics is for diplomatists to decide. 'If they
fail to agree about it we may have to leave the issue
to war. ;. â â ;.'â ",
ihe treasurer of a woman's. .'association in New
Jersey has skipped off with trie funds, and while there
is a good deal of talk' about the missing .lady and
much mourning over her absence, no one is asking:
"Who. is the man?"/ It seems there are' some rules
that don't work both ways..:.
anti- anarchist; legislation.
THAT some effort would be made at this Con
gress to procure the enactment of Feederal
laws against anarchists has been a foregone
conclusion ever since the assassination of the Presi
dent. Burning with a righteous wrath against the:
cruel and. wanton slayer of McKinley, the voice of the
people fiercely demanded not only the punishment
of the wretch actually guilty of the crime, but also of
those who incited \U There was, moreover, a demand
that anarchists be' excluded from this country alto
gether, and the demand was made emphatically
enough to impress itself upon the minds of' statesmen.
Consequently it is 'but ( natural that as soon as Con
gress got' ready for business there should be present
ed a large number of bills dealing with the issue. â '.
.Up to date it is said there have been submitted
more than a dozen anti-anarchist bills. , Of the whole
lot, however, it is doubtful if a single one would win
the approval of the American peopl^, now that they
have become calm. The problem is, in fact, much more
difficult than it appeared at first thought. It is not
easy to define anarchy. It is not easy to determine
just where public criticism of officials ceases to be
legitimate* politics and becomes anarchistical. Fur
thermore, when a definition of anarchy has been
found that will stand the test of the courts there re
mains the difficulty of providing an adequate penalty.
Senator Hoar has suggested the adoption of an in
ternational agreement \ setting apart some island in
the ocean as a place of imprisonment for anarchists,
and to which all such enemies of law and government
should be deported. The suggestion when first made
received considerable approval. It seemed something
like poetic justice that men who are opposed to gov
ernment should be given an island of their own where
they be forced to live with one another. There are,
however, difficulties in the way. Should the agree
ment be made the United States would have to assist
in holding in such imprisonment persons sent to the
island from countries where a fair trial is not always
guaranteed to an accused. . We might have to set
United States soldiers to act as jailers for Russia, and
that would not suit the 'American people for any great
length of time.
Considerations of a similar nature affect every one
of the more extreme propositions submitted in the
way of anti-ajWchist legislation. Something will be
done to exclude them from the country, but the ques
tion of punishment for, the commission of crime will
doubtless be left as it is now, to the States. The na
tiopal Government could not have dealt with Czol
gosz with any more firmness,\dignity and dispatch
than did the courts of New York. It would seem,
then, that in the m^in our laws are good enough, and
anything like radical legislation for the suppression
of anarchy or the punishment of anarchist assassins
will not be undertaken. *.
The productiveness of the country ha; now so far
outstripped the capacity of the railways for handling
it that serious trouble is expected in some. quarters.
Thus a recent report says a salt company in Virginia
has been unable to get cars to supply its customers,
and as no relief can be obtained from the manage
ment of the roads the company is thinking of appeal
ing to the Interstate. Commerce Commission to see
it it have not the power to compel the roads to haul
the freight. . \
THE WHITE HOUSE PROBLEM.
WITH the White- House as a combined
Presidential residence, executive office and
assembly, hall for state ceremonies there has
long been dissatisfaction. With the accession* of
each new President there have come new complaints
of inadequate facilities for the three purposes the
mansion is required to fill. It is large enough for a
residence, or for an executive office, or for a state
assembly hall, but it is notlarge enough for all three.
There is need of more room, and the need is urgent.
The T increased room required /for the President,
his family and his executive staff would doubtless
have been provided long ago had there ever been an
agreement as to the best means of providing it.
When'the Clevelands were at the White House it was
given out that Mrs. Cleveland favored the construc
tion of a residence for the President in another part
of- the city,\ieaving the present mansion to be used
as an office building for the executive department
of the Government and for state balls and dinners.
At that time there were elaborate plans made for
the proposed residence, and some of thorn were gen
erally â¢ approved. They came to nothing, however,
for when the Harrisons entered. the AVhite House a
different view was taken of the problem. The Presi
dent found an office. for himself in the State Depart
ment building and, thus relieved the White House to
some extent. The McKinleys had an altogether dif
ferent idea from their* immediate predecessors.
Their plan was to build additions to the present man
sion and thus, keep the residence and executive office
under one roof. Designs for that purpose were pre
pared and submitted to Congress. Now comes Presi
dent Roosevelt with a third plan. 'He recommends
the retention of the White House as the residence
of trfc President and the. erection of a new building
containing the executive offices and a series of salons
and apartments fitted for state ceremonies, receptions
and banquets. A bill to that effect has been intro
duced into Congress. .- ' L ; t
â  Since Roosevelt has nearly a whole four years' term
before him, and since Congress is now well satisfied
that something should be'dpne to provide more room
for the President, it is probable, we shall have the
Roosevelt plan carr;cd out. It will preserve to the
country unchanged' the historic "'White House of
which' the j people jiave grown to ,bc so fond. That
in itself, will be a popular thing. There is a certain
sentiment clustered round the old building that would
be hurt were the structure changed by huge addi
tions or : we're it converted to merely office uses. Con
sequently we may' : safely ;. expect a ': general approval of
the bill to erect anew executive office. That struc
ture can; : be designed for the special purposes for
which it\is intended, and, in that way/ the President
be. 1 provided ' with the means of welcoming Enibassa
dof s or J holding ; levees on ,, a scale worthy of his /high

Artificial Red Oranges.
German chemists, with their profound
love for investigation, have been probing
the blood orange with remarkable results.
The popular Idea In the land of the Kaiser
was that the blood oranj;e, or, as they call
it. the "Italian blood orange," is colored
not by nature, but by the injection of
some artificial vegetable dye. According
ly they set out, first, to find out from Ihe
frnit itself the nature of this dye, and,
second, to find a means of changing the
common Italian orange into a blood
orange by the injection of different kinds
of coloring matter.
It was found, however, that no single
Injection of any dye would color more
tnan a part of the oranjre, and that if sev
eral Injections were made the fruit was
likely to decompose quickly. They then
wrestled with the theory that the coloring
was produced by watering the roots of
the trees wjth a blood-red vegetable solu
tion, but so far without result.

OCEANIC COMPANY'S SONOMA BREAKS RECORD
IN RUN FROM HONOLULU TO SAN FRANCISCO
f=-rp=^ HREE mall steamships arrived in
I ' port yesterday. They were tho
1 ' Coptic from the Orient, the So
il, noma from Australasia and tho
% ' Leelanaw from Central America.
The Hancock, sailed .for the Phllipplnei
and the Walla' Walla for Puget Sound,
and all In al! It waff a busy day.-on^th*
front for the customs officers and others.
SONOMA MAKES NEW RECORD.
In Spite of Heavy Weather She Ar
rives on Time. â¢â  .
The Oceanic Mall Company's Sonoma
had a rough time of it coming from Ho
nolulu, but nevertheless she broke the
record and came in ahead of time. -The
Coptic left the Islands fourteen hours
ahead of the mail boat, but only anchored
in the stream one hour and a half ahead
of her. The official report showg that the
mail boat made the run in 5 days 13 hours
26 minutes, while the British ship took. 6
days 1 hour 30 minutes to make the run.
She got in ahead of the Sonoma/however,
and her passengers were landed before
the Oceania's flier had a chance to dock.
The official time records of the two
steamships were:
Coptic â From Hongkong, via Kobe and the
Inland Sea and Hawaii, 7531 miles, 2ti days 3
J:ours and 48 minutes. . .. â¢
Sonoma â From Sydney, N. S. W.. via Auck
land, Pago PaÂ«o and Honolulu, 7233 niiU'8. 19
days S huurs and 33 minutes.
The general reader can work out the
average for himself. After leaving Hono
lulu both the Sonoma and the Coptic ran
into a hovling gale. For four days they
were under a slow bell, but as soon as
Chief Engineer Little could Â£et a chance
to open out the engines of the Sonoma
she logged her 405 knots the tirst day.
Taking it a!! around, the Sonoma aver-'
aged fifteen and a h*ilf knots during her
7000-mile run, which is a splendid show-
Ing for a new boat. Chief Engineer Lrlttle
thinks there is no boat like her on the
Pacific
Manv Tourists on Sonoma.
Among these who came home on thÂ»
Sonoma were Commander Tllley and hi3
wife. The officer Is the Naval Governor
of Tut'Jila and was tried a month or so
ago br a naval board. He was found
guiltless of tho charges preferred against
him Â§nd tho natives of Pago Pago gave
him an ovation. When the case came to
trial aboard the Wisconsin there was not
a tittle of evidence to show that Governor
Tilley had been guilty of any irregulari
ties, so he was promptly exonerated by
Rear Admiral Casey.

Most Hair. Preparations Are Merely
Scalp Irritants, of No Value.
Most hair preparations are merely scalp
Irritants, miscalled hair tonics. When
hair is brittle, lusterless and begins to
fall out, the dandruff germ is getting In '
its deadly work at the root, sapping I the
vitality. Since science discovered that
dandruff is a germ disease there has been
only one preparation put on the market
that will entirely destroy the dandruff
germ, and that la Newbro's Herpicide. ; It
allays . i itching . Instantly, destroys \ the
germ; and then falling hair stops; and
hair grows luxuriantly. Ask .your drug-
gist for Herpicide. It; allays itching in-
stantly; makes hair grow.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nczu York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Dec. 16â There was no re
newal of ths pressure of liquidation in the
stock market to-day, but there was manifest
hesitation about undertaking any operations
for an advance. A handful of stocks were ad
vanced by professional operations in a seeming
attempt to induce a following and to influence
the general market. The evidently easier con-
Cition of the mvney market encouraged this
movement, but the fear of a recurrence of
stringency and the unsettling influence of the
renewed weakness in Amalgamated Copper xiiÂ»
couraged its extension. Amalgamated Copper
started downward from the opening momen
tarily to "* above Jast week's closing. It-grav
itated for the retTV>f the *â >â¢â  with only slight
rallies to the low. point at <il%, where it
closed. The fluctuations in the stock were not
violent and traders described its action as a
fall of its own weight, without any apparent
artificial pressure. The net loss is 3%. It is
taken for granted that the renewed decline
foreshadowed a reduction In the dividend on
Thursday, as the disbursement of dividends by
a subsidiary company is tied up by injunction
Th* rate of dividend is expected by speculators
at all the way from 1 per cent quarterly down
to passing It entirely. Fears are professed also
that the cut in the selling price of raw copper
made last week Is a preliminary to further
cuts and to a war of rates. It was worthy of
remark that in London the price of futures
dosed higher than for spot, for the first time
elnce the first week In October. The -prospect
of the unsettling influence of mystery and un
certainty over the Amalgamated dividend rate
until its actual declaration was sufficient In
lteelf to discourage activity in the general
market. The, strength of â¢ the Saturday bank
etatement is entirely â â  due â¢ to the speculative
liquidation which took place last week. ,â  To
expand immediately the loan account of the
banks would threaten, it is feared, a recur
rence of stringent money. Rumors of dangers
narrowly averted last week helped to prevent
imprudence. Last week's loan contraction was
well distributed among the banks. . showing
imprudence.- Last week's loan contraction was
accountable for it. The condition of the world's
markets was easier all around to-day. The
only stocks whose strength was conspicuous
were New York Central. Manhattan, St. Louis
and San Francisco, Long Island, the Iowa Cen
trals, Rubber Goods preferred and Colorado
Fuel. Their gains were all curtailed in sympa
thy with the late weakness in Amalgamated
Copper. Net changes generally are narrow.
The bond market was dull and irregular. To
tal sales. $1,755,000.

tiser's London financial cablegram, says: ' â '
There was a buoyant outburst In the stock

Africans are booming and attention is diverted
from American stocks. Consols spurted %.
American shares broke with copper, which
touched Â£50 the ton and closed at Â£50 10s.
There Is a report here that Amalgamated

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Foreign markets came through
weaker, though Broomhall cabled bullish con
ditions in the Argentine and some of the Rus
sian provinces. The supply on passage to the
United Kingdom decreased 720,000 bushels
during the week. The world's shipments for
the week were as follows. In quarters: j Rus
sian, 233,000; Danublan, 147,000; -Argentine,
37,000; Indian, 47,000; Australian, 35,000. The
crop of Manitoba was officially stated to be
50,500.000 bushels of wheat and 28,000,000
bushels of oats, and Manitoba and the North
western provinces will have' 60,000,000 bushels
of wheat for export. â  :, .
Chicago opened at S0%c, but fell back to
79%c. The opening was firmer on lighter re
ceipts in the Northwest, cold 'weather and
Broomhall's cables mentioned above. Minne
apolis reported the cash demand good, with
millers the best buyers. Later on the market
â weakened on the very large increase of 4,116,
000 bushels in the American visible supply, and
the bears hammered quotations down. New
York reported a better export demand for the
United Klnzdom and Continent.

IN THE CABINET
Senate Finally Confirms
His Nomination as
Attorney General
Fight to Have Confirmation
Delayed Meets With
Quick Defeat.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.-J us t before
acoourimient to-night the Senate con
armed the nomination of Philander C
Knox to fce Attorney General of the
1 mted States. The nomination of Knox
â¢was taken up when the Senate first went
Kito executive session a few minutes after
12 oclcck, but the point was made that
SffiSfSi ShouM be actlon on Hay
*achoi iÂ» t tr n^ ty> nder the agreement
if- ,i last Thursday. The virtue of
niis plea was conceded, and a tentative
SKSSit was J^e that fu?thlr con
siderations oi the nomination should be
postponed until to-morrow. When, how
Â£Â£?Â£*& ? c T ate had disposed of the
wÂ£J Â«"Â«r At jorney General's nomination
waa again called up. The discussion of
it tu.ned upon a. motion made by Senator
-ones of Arkansas to recommit the nomi
nation to the Committee on Judiciary, in
tae meantime publishing the testimony
l.earinc on the case.
s P eec hes In favor of this proposition were
made by Senators Jones and Turner, and
m opposition by Senators Hoar and Pet
tus. It was contended by the two Sena-
Tors last named that the only evidence
lF e 5 en J ed a S a l"st confirmation had been
it lea fcy members of the Anti-Trust
l^aguo and was very vague and Indefl-
Yi' ,, The Sen ators favoring the motion
said that if this were true there could
be no objection on the part of the friends
or the Attorney General to- placing all
the facts within reach of the public and
Die more time the committee s-liould give
to the subject the more thoroughly the
public /would be convinced of the fair
ness of its position when ultimately
taken. They dwelt at some length upon
the charge made that the Attorney Gen
eral, previous to entering: upon the duties
of that office, had been attorney for the
Lnited States Steel Corporation and the
armor plate manufacturers. In reply to
these accusations it was said that it was
legitimate for an attorney In prl
?" ate i_i fe â to represent any interest
â¢n his official capacity, and It was
Â»"gued that his position as counselor for
lose Interests could not be used legiti
mately against him in connection with
his nomination to a position under the
present administration. So long as he
had conducted himself with propriety his
relationship as an attorney should not
r>Â« used to his Injury as an official. The
motion to recommit was lost. The ballot
>tood 43 to 7. There was no roll call on

ANARCHISTS MAY
BE DRIVEN OUT
Senate Judiciary Com
mittee to Report on
Needed Lawa
Federal Constitution Will Be
Amended if Found
Necessary.
"WASHINGTON.. D. C. Dec. 16.'â In the
Senate to-day a resolution offered by Clay,
directing Jhe Postmaster General to send
to the Senate, a complete statement of the
amounts paid by the I'nited States Gov
ernment to various eteamshin lines for
mail service, together with copies of the
contract in each case, was agreed to.
A resolution offered by Nelson cÂ£ Min
nesota, requesting the President to send
to the Senate a copy of the report of Em
bassador Choate. relative to certain
charges imposed by "London dock com
panies upon American Hour and otht-r
American products shipped to that port,"
was adopted.
Vest of Missouri called up his resolu
tion instructing the Judiciary Committee
to inquire into and report to the Senate,
by bill or otherwise, as to tho proper nc
tion by Congress upon the subject of
anarchy and anarchists. He .Â«aid ho did
not desire at this time to enter upon a
discussion of the -subject. Indeed, he did
not feel qualified to discuss it until he had
heard from the Judiciary Committee. The
resolution raised these questions: .
Has Congress the constitutional power to
legislate for the punishment or anarchists who
assassinate or attempt to assassinate the
President of the United States, ' and if not.
whether It is expedient to amend the Federal
constitution to enable Congress eo to legislatp.
Whether 1t is necessary to empower Congress
to prevent the teachings of anarchists that all
Uovemments should bo destroyed, and the chief
rulers of euch Governments assassinated.
Whether it is necessary that Congress shall
nave power to punish persons belonging to an
archical associations.
What amendments, if any, are necessary to
the naturalization law* to prevent anarchists
from . becoming citizens of the United States
and whether such anarchists, after trial and
conviction, be imprisoned or deported from the
United States.
Whether it fs necesskry to confer upon Con-
Rress the power to establish a penal colony
where persons convicted of anarchy shall be
confined durlnc life.
Without discussion or comment 'the res
olution was adopted.
Clapp of Minnesota called up his, reso
lution providing that further discussion of
the pending Hay-Pauncefote treaty should
be had in open session.
Addressing the Senate briefly he said
that while the* resolution was not intro
duced as a Joke the country regarded the
executive sessions of the Senate as a
rarce. He did not think there was any
occasion under ordinary conditions for se
cret sessions of the Senate. Despte every
effort of the Senate the American people
obtaind reports of secret sessions. While
nis resolution, he believed, would be
shelved, he was of the opinion that the
executive sessions "will become a part or
the tradition and rubbish of this crcat
people of ours."
Mason of Illinois coincided with the
views expressed by Clapp and declared
that the Senate's executive sessions were
an ' ancient barnacle," which ought to be
swept away. Mason was Interrupted by
Money of Mississippi, "who raised a point
of order against discussion of the subject
In open session, but finally the resolution
was referred, on motion of Spooner of
\\ isconsin, to the Committee on Rultes.
Then, at 12:12 p. m.. the Senate went into
executive session, and at 6:23 adjourned
as a mark of respect to the memory of the
late Representative Broslus.
AGREE TO PUT
UP THEIR GUNS
Rival Tongs Promise Not
to Shed More
. Blood.
If the warring factions live up to the
agreement which they signed yesterday
af ternoon there will be no further blood
shed in Chinatown. Shortly after 4 o'clock
the twelve associations and the leading
members of the Chinese Merchants' As
sociation met and discussed the best
means to stop the war between the Four
families and the Ping Kong Tong.
After the matter had been thoroughly
discussed the officers of the Ping Kons
Tong and the leading members of the
Four families were sent for. It was
pointed out to them that further blood
shed would seriously Injure any chance
that may exist to defeat the exclusion
bill, and also cause the white people of
this city to look upon the Chinese as out
laws and assassins at heart. Both sides
were then asked to present their griev
ances for the purpose of effecting a peace
settlement. After listening to the spokes
men of the warring factions for some
time, a committee composed of an equal
number of the members of the twelve, as
sociations and the Merchants' Associa
tion was appointed to draw up the terms
of peace, both sides agreeing to abide by
them. The. committee then went Into ex
ecutive session and In a short time pre
sented the agreement, which both sides
signed, and by which it is expected fur
ther bloodshed will be prevented. The
agreement provides that in event a
Chinaman is murdered the faction respon
sible for the death shall pay the other the
eum of $5000; that the Merchants' Asso
ciation holds itself ready to make good
the amount in case the Four families fail
to live up to the agreement, and the
twelve associations to do likewise for the
Ping Kong Tong. Heavy bonds were ex
acted from both sides to Insure their liv
ing up to the agreement.
It was also agreed that all the perpe
trators of the recent murders shall be
turned over to the police within forty
eight hours and that they shall be vigor
ously prosecuted. In case another mur
der is committed the perpetrator, or per
pertators, shall be turned over to the fac
tion to which the victim belonged and
put tq death if the circumstances of the
murder warrant such punishment.
As soon as the agreement was signed
posters were pasted upon the walls of
Chinatown announcing that the war had
been declared oft*. .â¢
The news was received With delight by
the peaceable residents and congratula
tions were heartily exchanged.
Since the trouble began six men havo
been murdered and two seriously
wounded.

"LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD" GIVEN
AS TIVOLI'S CHRISTMAS OFFERING
Extravaganza Proves PopularâJefferson De Angelis Drawing t Well at the
Columbia-Larger Audience Witnesses Second Production of "Rip Van
Winkleâ "Diplomacy" Well Presented at the Grand Opera-House
THERE is more real fun to thfl
square inch in "Little Red Ridirijj
Hood," the Tlyoli's new Christmas
extravaganza, sampled last night,
than in any other little thing that
Ferris Hartman haa "dashed off." â¢ And
that's saying a. good deal.
It was the return of tho house folks last
night, as well as the occasion of the open
ing of the Christmas show, and they
seemed to be just as glad to be back as
we are to have them. Most of the* fa
miliar faces were to ho seenâ Annie My
ers, trim and roguish as ever; Edward
Webb, the old reliable; the tuneful Ar
thur Cunningham, the ever beautiful Har
ry Cashman and Jt'erris Hartman, the one
and only, among them. There are new
faces, too. Florence Chapman, a San
i-ranclsoo girl, who has been with the
Southwell Opera Company for some time,
as. a decided acquisition and makes a
letching picture as Little Red Riding
hood. Olive Ulrica is another pretty girl
that has been gathered in, who shows
aptness and charm in her role of Miss
Aiutrett. Barneita Mueller, the fairy
queen, has been seen Â«tnd heard before as
Nedda during the grand opera , season,
and is much more in her element in the
spangles of fairy queen than as Nedda.
tor the rest, the chorus has been very
considerably enlarged, and a tiny army
of small folks a<ia quaintness and pret
tiness to the scene. There are some un
usually dainty ballets, plenty of good
songs for everybody and a host of spe
cialties of the brightest. The snow ballet,
with its snowclao girls and white-garbeu
children, is particularly pretty, but it is
only one out of a number equally effec
tive.
Hartman. has a role that Jits him to a
dot as King Fire Fly. later Simplo Simon,
and from the moment of his picturesque
entrance on an airship keeps the laugh
going until the close. He sings one of tho
funniest, of the Eddie Foy songs, "I'm
Tired," in a fashion to convulse a dead
Scotchman, and others of his songs,
"Th<?y Gave Me a Medal for That" and
the Hartmanized edition of "When Shake
speare Comes to Town," fully fill the bill,
and were encored until the Tlvoli's hemi
demi-semi-barytone'a voice broke. Webb
is also fitted congenially with his part of
the Baron Itubberneck. and his pleasing
voice and sprightly, happy humor help
things along amazingly. Liut Arthur Cun
ningham has the voice of the crowd and
he uses it with a line swing in his one
good song, â¢ The Mermaid." There ought
to be more of him. more particularly as he
has loosened up considerably in his acting
since his last appearanco. Harry Cash
man is a Granny Hood who gets all, and
maybe somewhat moro than is best to get
out of the part. It Is a littleâ Just a shade
â more vulgar than funny.
Annie Myers is Boy Bluo and as piquant
as ever in tho part. Sho is tho only
woman in the company whot makes any
pretense of singing. Her voice is fresh
and bright, and every word of her songs
can be heard. Mr. StelndorfC Is back
again in the conductor's chair, and the
musical end of the extravaganza was
handled with all his customary smartness.
Some of the music is uncommonly good,
too. Then there's the transformation
scene, in which Mr. McGreer has outdone
himself, and all In all, "Little Red Riding
Hood' 13 much the best Christmas pro
duction that the Tivoli_has ever put on.
Alcazar.
: There is plenty of snap and fun in the
farce comedy. "The Gay Mr. Lightfoot,"
presented at the Alcazar Theater. It is
from the pen of Louis de Lange and Led
Arthur and had. a long and successful run
In New York. There' are numerous com
plications caused by two "friends, ;" Mr.
Lfghtfoot and Mr. Jerome, assuming 'each
other's names for a night and a day. Two
pretty love tales run through the piece,
and Te. Jim, an Indian, and an old maid
help materially to get things mixed up,
which are, of course, smoothed out in the
final act. Frank Bacon, as Mr. Lightfoot,
has a part that admirably suits his genial
humor and he makes the most of it. M ;
L. Alsop as his friend, Mr. Jerome, has
also a congenial part and plays it with
his usual manliness. Henry Shumer, a
Government agent in pursuit of .Te Jim,
the Indian bigamist, and who falls in
love with Mr. Lightfoot's niece, is also
well suited to the role. Howard Scott
plays the Indian with his usual care.
Miss Marion Convere, a widow with a
thorough knowledge of men but who falls
a prey to the persistent love making of
Mr. Jerome, is very charming, and tho
same can be said of Miss Margaret Wych
erly as Miss Helen, . Lightfoot's niece.
Miss Juliet Crosby made a hit as Miss
Opie, an old maid very much in love, and
Miss Marie Howe was in her element as
Mrs. Lightfoot, the jealous wife. The
play should have a successful run.

A much larger audience than that of

Perkins has received a communication
from Secretary Hay in reply to . his letter

Sea. Secretary Hay has communicated a
similar "inquiry from the Manufacturers'

kins Secretary Hay says: "This is a sub
ject which hinges upon arbitration now in
progress between .the United States and
Kussia" relative "'to the Beizureof certain
American vessels in the Bering and
Okhotsk seas and it is probable that the
Russian Government considers that any
favorable answer which it might give to
this question would be detrimental to its
interests in litigation. The department is,
therefore, inclined to â¢ the opinion that
Russia will not reply until the arbitrator
renders his decision. I may add that the
Russian Government maintains the 'head

boundary as regards its bays and what
ever might 1 be its attitude regarding cod
fishing, the taking of seals would be prob

Some of the letters read as if they were

DARING THIEF
MAKES A HAUL
'A daring daylight burglar entered the
residence of Paul Manciet, 1628 Clay street,
last Monday afternoon while all the mem
bers of the family were out, and got away
with quite a "rich haul of diamonds,
watches and other pieces of jewelry.
The burglar effected an entrance to. the
house through the \ basement door, j He
went upstairs to Manciet's room. on. the
second floor and rifled it. \ On Mrs. Man
ciet's dressing table 1 lay her diamond ear
rings and her small gold watch. These
the thief pocketed. As there was nobody
in the house to molest him the burglar
took out the bureau drawers and turned
their contents on the floor. Mr. Manciet's
gold watch, diamond cuff buttons and dia
mond ring were in a jewel case in one of
the drawers, and these, too fell into the
hands of the burglar.
After rifling all the drawers completely
the thief searched . the room for money.
He. turned all the pictures, pulled out ail
the clothes in the closet and even went so
far as to rip open the mattress on" the
bed in his vain search for coin.
While the burglar was doing his ne
farious .work ; Mrs. Clavarre, a friend of
Mrs. Manciet.'. called. She rang the bell
four or five times and the burglar becom
ing frightened hastened downstairs and
made his escape to the street. When Mrs.
Clavarre- > heard the footsteps coming
downstairs she. thought It was one of the
family coming to let her in so she peered
through the glazed door and got a good
look at the burglar as he was beating his
hasty retreat. :: .,

tion of the stolen articles and a descrip

"GET TOGETHER,"
SAYS ROSEBEBY
Formeiv Premier .'Gives
Advice to the Lib
nun 1 Moinf tt
erai rarty.
Quotes President Roosevelt to
Give Emphasis to His <
Argument/
CHESTERFIELD, . England. Dec. 16.â
Ix>rcl Rosebery's long 1 expected and much
heralded speech, delivered from a crowded
platform here to-night, was received with
marked enthusiasm by an immense
crowd. It can hardly be said to have
thrown much light along the pathway of
the Liberal party. He said that he hail
come by invitation and did not wish to
Indulge in phraseology, but to speak his
mind and offer the Liberals some dispas
sionate advice. That the speech was a
finished oratorical effort was amply at
tested by the frequent applause with
which the speaker was interrupted. But
it is doubtful if when ho had finished hi3
most . admiring listener could have given
any justification for his enthusiasm, save
that it, was Lord Rosebery. '
The Liberal party, he said, had passed
through a long and trying illness, but
was now approaching convalescence, one
of the signs of which was that it had
got rid of the Irish alliance. Resolved
into its elements, the speech merely said.
"Get together." The speaker himself con
fessed that he did .not pretend to say how
this cohesion could be accomplished. In
urging his fellow Liberals to reorganize.
Lord Rosebery quoted the following words
from the message of President Roosevelt:
"We hope to Keep goinif by slow-step--',
not' by bounds. We must keep our. eyes
on the stars, but we must jilso remember
that our feet are on the ground."
The following was the tenor of. the for
mer Premier's speech: "The : Ministry is
wrong, but the Liberals should be very
careful how they try to set it right."
Turning: from the Immediate outbreak
of the war, Lord Rosebery touched upon
education, In which, he said, Great Brit
ain was woefully behind her. sister na
tions. Her commercial development was
also atrophied, and the time would soon
como when Britain -would be forced to
fight for trade supremacy. She would
then be as helpless as though armed with
bows and arrows. â  â¢ *
Lord Kosebory maintained a discreet
vagueness on the question of his personal
Inclinations concerning tho leadership of
the Liberal party. He salt! that he could
not imagine himself Â»n tho position of a
Minister. But in the next breath hf> toM
how ho would reorganize the War Office
if it fell to his lot. He Baid this reor
ganization, however, should bo postponed
until after tho war.
Tho speaker's recipe for the proposed
reorganization of this office was a char
acteristically American one, namely, the
appointment of a commission. Concern
'ing the Government's conduct of the war
Lord Rosobery wns severe and scornful.
The complaint of the Government that tho
Boers had not made war according to the
recognized rules reminded him that thÂ«Â»
same thing had been said by the old Aus
trian generals of the young Napoleon
when the latter was beating them. . Ho
was particularly sarcastic at the expenso
of the explanation of the Earl of Hals
bury, the Lord Chancellor, that only a
"sort of warfare was now going on." ,and
ho- strongly condemned what he termed
the scandalous misrepresentations by
which the Government has precipitated
tho last general election.
TRYING TO FIX
VALUE OF LAND
Site for Naval Station at
Honolulu Causes a
Lawsuit.
HONOLULU, Dec. 9.â Captain Henry,
who is in charge of the Pearl Harbor
dredging, states that the actual % work of
dredging the channel will' begin next
month. .... " , . . -
The suit of the Government against the
Bishop estate to condemn land for the
naval station has been before the United,
States Court for two weeks and is still
far from an end. Tho testimony as \ to
the value of the land is most conflicting.
Some of the witnesses for the Government
have testified that it is practically worth
less, declaring that a fair price for the
Government to pay would be $5iPer acre,
while witnesses for the other Side, have
gone as -high as $300 per acre for a' good
deal of the land. The defendants' claim
over $600 , per acre, . basing their claim
largely upon the fact that the Govern
ment proposes to take all their water
front. - â  â¢ â 
Complete returns as to the income tax
show that the amount of the: tax col
lected will be. far below the sum expect
ed when the law was passed. The re
turns show an aggregate assessment of
$335,000, which is only about half of what
it was hoped the tax would bring in.' The
tax is 2 per cent on all over $1000 for
every individual or corporation, and the
returns therefore show that, .with the
$1000 deducted in each case, incomes ag
gregating $16,750,000 net were . received
here during 1900. Of the total returns of
$337,000, $277,000 are from Honolulu. The
smallness of the figures Is believed to be
due in. paxt to", recent falls in augar
stocks. V

HEINE PIANO CO.. 217 Geary st.
A GOOD thing to recollect Is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he Is entitled to. We give a perfect,
sound and undamaged new piano for lesa
money than is often asked for patched up
and made over instruments, worked off under
all sorts of disguises. It is much better to
get a reliable new piano that Is known, than
a "bargain" that is good only for the tima
being. Our pianos or customers are not
"wrecked." Ask about our new plan of
$1 50 per week. We sell Wlssner. Decker

SAMOANS AGREE
TO BUILD ROADS
Will Look to Uncle Sam
for Reward for the
Improvements.
Many Natives Favor Adopt
ing the Constitution of
the United States.
TUTUILA, Samoa. Dec. 3.â At a general
meeting of the people of Tutuila, held on
November 21 at Nuuili, which was pre
sided over by Lieutenant J. L, Jayne, U. S.
N., then commanding the station, one di
vision strongly urged the adoption, of the
constitution of the United States in Its en
tirety, and at the same time asked that
all other South Sea Islanders and Sa
moans from German Samoa be sent back
to their homes. This was s*enuously op
posed by the stronger eastern district, one
of whose talking men stood up and said,
"You are foolish; you do not know what
you are doing. Are we not all related?
Do you want to build a wall around your
own district and then shut yourselves
up? You read the Bible and do not un
derstand it. You hear about the constitu
tion of the United States and do not un
derstand it. It is better to wait and let
the people grow in enlightment first."
At the same meeting the commanding
officer stated that he wanted the natives
of the towns to build their roads, and he
ordered the county chiefs to see that his
wishes in the matter were carried out.
The orators who wanted the United States
constitytlon adopted objected, and told
the meeting that they would not build the
roads unless the United States Govern
ment paid for the laborâ that they pre
ferred going to Jail rather than work on
the road3. - â 
The sum of $25,000 has been appropriated
by the .Government for grading, and the
dissenters claimed that this money should
be paid to them for roadmaklng. The op
position said that this country paid no
road taxes, and it was wrong to expect
the United States to send money for the
construction of roads; that in their dis
tricts they were going ahead in road
making and did not expect any pay. This
argument finally prevailed, and it was ar
ranged for the people to build their own
roads and trust to getting aid from the
.Government for the construction of the
main roads, which, by the way, are bad
ly needed for facilitating the work of the
station and the Government.
The spirit of roadmaking has taken
hold of the people, and to commemorate
the death of President McKmley the na
tives of one county decided to build a
road instead of indulging in feasting and
carrying out their old heathenish customs
attending the death- of a great "king."
The road is to be called McKinley road,
and at the request of the people Mrs. TM
ley, the wife of Governor Tilley, turned
the first sod for the road November 25,
and since then the natives have been
working with might and vigor to complete
the work as soon as possible. The road
is an important one.
A farewell feast was given in honor of
Captain Tilley in Pago Pago November 30,
and at the same time one of welcome to
Captain Sebree, his successor. There were
many strong expressions of regret at the
action of the Government In relieving
Captain Tilley, and an address to the
President of the United States has been
numerously signed by the chiefs embody
ing the feelings of the Samoans in the
matter.

SENATOR PERKINS TO
INTRODUCE BILL TO-DAY
Pacific Coast Delegates Will Attempt
to Secure Philippine Trade for
. American Vessels.
The leading shipowners on the Pacific
Coast, together with representatives of
the commercial bodies of San Francisco
and Seattle, recently sent a petition to the
coast delegates in both branches of Con
gress asking that efforts be -made to se
cure the passage of a measure which
would make the coastwise navigation laws
applicable .to the Philippine trade.
It is felt by the commercial men that
this protection Is equally Important and
quite as necessary as that afforded in se
curing to American vessels the Hawaiian
ii.terisland commerce. William M. Bun
ker, the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce representative at the national capi
tal, has been active in reminding the Cali
fornia delegation that something must be
done in the â  matter. v . â 
That a vigorous attempt to secure the
enactment of the desired law Is about to
be made is evidenced by the following
telegram which Mr. Bunker sent to G. W.
Newhall yesterday:
"Senator Perkins will to-morrow Intro
duce bill 'applying coasting navigation
laws to Philippines not later than Janu
ary, 1903." '
Stairs G-ave Way Under Him.
James Parker, a teamster residing at

by a fall from the back stairway leading
to' the residence; of a. customer at 147a
O'Farrell street.' Parker was in the act
of climbing up the stairway with a sack
of coal on his shoulder when the step
broke under his weight and precipitated
him a distance of twenty feet to the yard
beneath. ~ In addition to numerous lacerat
ed wounds Inflicted on hrs body by silvers
from the broken boards through which he
fell, Parker sustained a sprain of the
spinal column, which may possibly term
inate fatally. .He was taken to the Emer
gency Hospital, where Dr. Murphy ad
ministered restoratives and otherwise
treated his wounds. ..

NULLIFIES WORK
OF ASSESSORS
Colorado Supreme Court
Rules Against State
Officials.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 16.â Attorney
General C. C. Post, Secretary A. B. Gray
of the. State Board of Assessors, and ten
of the thirteen members of the board were
to-day adjudged in contempt of the Su
preme Court of Colorado. No punishment
was inflicted and they were all discharged.
The court ordered that the work of the
State board of thirteen assessors in send
ing out the schedules of corporate assess
ment to the various counties be declared
null and void and that all the acts of
the State board performed after the order
of the court restraining them was Issued
be set aside. The court held that as it
had the power to undo the work it should
net in this instance Inflict other punish
ment.
No sooner had the court announced its
opinion than the Attorney General, the
secretary and other members of the board
were served with a writ of injunction by
Judge Hallett, restraining | them from
again sending out schedules of assess
ment.' This will transfer theÂ«flght from
the State Supreme Court to the United
States District Court.
The effect of thia action on the part of
the two courts will be to tie up the as
sessments of the State so far as corpora
tions are concerned for some time. It will
not affect the other assessments.

DISRATED POLICEMAN
GETS WRIT OF MANDATE
Judge Hebbard Directs Police Com
missioners to Restore Bernhard
Harter to Bank.
The application of Bernhard Harter for
a writ of mandate compelling the Board
of Police Commissioners to restore him
to the rank of sergeant waa granted yes
terday by Judge Hebbard. The court
held that the Harter case was of the same
legal status as the case of Lieutenant
Price, who was restored to duty as a po
liceman on a similar writ issued by Judge
Hebbard.
Harter was appointed a police officer ln
1578 and was made a sergeant In 1894. In
that year he was reduced to the rank of
patrolman without, he claims, a trial. It
is expected that many other disrated po
licemen will bring similar suits.

WIDOW HOBSON
GETS DECISION
Colorado Court Awards
Her Portion of Hus
band's Estate.
PUEBLO, CoL, Dec. 16.â When tha
Hobson will contest came up In the Dis
trict Court to-day the atorneys for the
defense asked for more time to bring wit
nesses from California to prove the il
legitimacy of the eight-months-old daugh
ter of Mrs. Stella J. Hobson of Los An
geles, basing their allegations upon a 30
called ante-death statement of the de
ceased, George H. Hobson, that no child
could possibly be born to him and that
any issue would not be recognized.
The motion was overruled and tbe court
decided in favor of the plaintiff, who will
now receive ?10O,OOO as her share to the
estate of Hobson.
After the trial the attorneys for the.
defense stated that the child would now
be recognized as he Issue of George H.
Hobaon and would share the estate, but
that Mrs. Hobson would not receive a
cent owing to the alleged ante-nuptial
contract with Hobson, which the detense
claim they can establish.
Not a single witness was produced by
the defense to support their illegitimacy
allegation. Mrs. Hobson identified -.ho
child, Georgia, as her own, and Dr. Billa
Hay, a physician who was .present at the
birth in California last April, declared zhe
Infant to be the child born on that oc
casion.
Mrs. Hobson has filed a petition asking
that herself and child be made the sole,
heirs to the large estate, thus cutting out
the brothers and sisters of the dead man,
who are the defendants In the present
suit. The motion was set aside and will
be heard later.

missioner. It contained the following pa
ragraph:
"I hope everything Is working well and
that no one will get on to our secret
work at the dam. So tell the boys to be
very cautious in everything they do."
Doolittle was asked what he meant by
"sec/et work" at the dam and he refused
to answer. . CVjunsel for the defendant said
that he expected to prove that the secret
work mentioned in the letter was a false
opening made in the structure so that the
debris was enabled to escape . surrepti
tiously through the dam.
Judge Morrow, to whom the matter was
referred, instructed Doolittle to answer
the question under penalty of contempt
of court.
The taking of the deposition will be re
sumed in a few days. â  â¢ ...
WABNING WOED FROM â¢
PROFESSOR DUDLEY
Extols President Roosevelt for That
Part of His Message Dealing
With Forestry.
Stereopticon views and a graphic de
scription of- the forests of California in
the Sierras, by Professor W. R. Dudley of
Stanford University, did much last even
ing to enlighten a great crowd at the
Academy of Sciences, both as to the mar
vels of nature and the deplorable waste
of timber that is going on. That the for
ests arc in imminent danger of destruc
tion was shown, and the lecturer empha
sized his warning by citing that part of
President Roosevelt's message which re
ferred to irrigation and forestry.
No statesman, the speaker .said, had
ever before shown so great an intimacy
with that vital subject as had the Presi
dent. Professor Dudley then described
his long travels from San Diego to the
Siskiyou Mountains, and through the Sier
ras from the foothills to the timber line,
from flat land to great and almost unap
proachable heights. The Kaweah peaks
were admirably illustrated, as were also
the wlid peaks of the Sierras.
Sunnyside Promised a School.
Mayor-elect Schmltz, while spending
last Sunday as the guest of Gus Schnee
at his residence. 66 Joost avenue, made
an investigation of the sites chosen by
the Sunnyside residents for a new school
building, which they so much stand In
need of. The one most favored by the
residents met with the approval of the
Mayor-elect and he pledged his influence
to have a suitable school building erected
for the district. The new Mayor was ac
companied by his wife. Attorney Ruef
and the members of his family and some
other invited friends.

that it Is perfectly proper."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1UO1.
There was no waste of time In the pre
liminaries of discussion. Dr. McGraw,
the first speaker from San Jose, stated
In direct fashion that the -judg
ment- of the local committee was' in
favor of May 26 as the day for open
ing the convention. If an earlier date
should be required he would recommend
April 15, as the municipal election would
take place on May 19.
â¢ E. A. Hayes favored an early conven
tion, basing his argument on the surmise
that the State Nominating Convention
would take place in July. He suggested
April 14 ag a suitable day. remarking that
April was the most beautiful month of
the year in the Santa Clara Valley.
Primary Election Law.
Henry C. Dibble reminded the conven
tion that the State Convention to nomin
ate candidates could not meet until the
latter part of August or early in Septem
ber, as the primary election for delegates
must be held on August 13. Judge Dibble
however, favpred an early league conven
tion. He thought it better to go to San
Jose. before the Republicans had exhaust
ed themselves on the municipal election.
He moved that April 14 be fixed as the
time -for opening the convention.
President Anderson invited 'opinions
generally as to whether that date would
be acceptable. Stewart of Amador, Woods
?! s Â»n Lid* Obispo, Senator Selvage of
Hu i 11 J5,Â°, ldtf Sen ator Lukens of Oakland
and Clio Lloyd of Santa Barbara said the
Republicans at their localities-, would ap
prove that choice of time. ' ....-.
1 Alden said, as president. : of
the league, he wanted the convention to
be a great success for.the.partyâ an event
equaling in magnitude the convention at
Los Angeles last year. "He desjred that
the convention. in San Jose, should break
all records for attendance -and 'enthusl-

ping of early fruit began in May, and
therefore favored an earlier date.
The proposition to name April 14 as the
date was then agreed upon. It was the
sense of the meeting that the work of the
convention could be transacted in two
days. After listening to Dr. McGraw, O.
A. Hale, E. A. Hayes and others of the
committee concerning the allurements of
the Santa Clara Valley and the probable
desire of delegates to remain for a day
or two after the conclusion of the work,
the third day was added. Dr. McGraw
indicated that the delegates would not be
able to leave, until the third day Jf they
accepted the hospitalities of San Jose on
the evening of the second day.
President Anderson was authorized to
appoint a committee of live to present a
programme embracing the topic of
speeches and a list of eminent talkers.
Dr McGraw wanted the committee to
say directly what -was expected of San
Jose. He Indicated that the people
wanted to do all that others had done
and a little more. He desired that the
executive committee should shut out cold
storage proxies and. arrange that dele
gates who could not attend should send
alternates or representatives.
President Anderson . remarked that San
Jose would be expected to provide a con
vention hall. .Beyond that the league had
no suggestion to make. Dr. McGraw was
assured, however, that there would be
no lack of attendance.
Secretary Al Lindley presented reports
showing that 1G00 seats in the Los An
geles convention of 1900 were occupied by
delegates.
Senator Lukens remarked that Oakland
sent 100 delegates to the Los . Angeles
meeting and would probably send 300 to
San Jose in April next.
The basis of representation was fixed
at one delegate for every twenty-five club
members. The , secretary's report was
presented, in which it - was shown that
27a clubs, with a : membership approximat
ing G5.000, were affiliated with the State
League. -
POLICE WANT
TIM HEGARTY
Warrant Out for the Ar-
rest of Australian
Pugilist.
The police are searching the city for
Tim Hegarty, the lightweight pugilist
from Australia. 'â¢ A â warrant for his ar
rest on the charge of defrauding an Inn
keeper has been issued.- < The complain
ing witness is. the pugilist's uncle, Dennis
Hegarty, hotel-keeper, Colma.
Deputy Sheriff P. J. Corral of San
Mateo County called upon Judge Cabaniss
yesterday with the warrant for his in
dorsement so that there would be no
quibble over Hegarty "s arrest when thai
event happened. . : -
Hegarty â¢ had â  his training quarters In
his uncle's hotel. His uncle built him an
addition at considerable expense espe
cially for training for his fight with Kid
La vigne, which -took place last Thurs
day night at the Acme Club in Oakland,
when Hegarty was defeated by the Kid.
His uncle alleges that Hegarty is owing
him ?400 for board, lodging and ' other
expenses for himself and trainers. The
pugilist, his uncle claims, promised faith
fully to pay the amount Immediately after
his fight with La vigne.- He has not kept
his promise and Dennis has not seen him
since Thursday. When Dennis learned
that the purse had been divided be
tween Tim and the Kid he came to the
conclusion that Tim intended to let him
whistle for his money, so he 1 procured
the warrant for hia arrest.
CLAIMS REGENT
ASSAULTED HIM
Policeman Arrests At
torney Reinstein for
: Drunkenness.
Woman Figures in the Case
and Mystery Is Thrown
Around It.
To be arrested for drunkenness and bat
tery is a distinction which the average
Regent of the State University seldom has
thrust upon him. Regent J. B. Reinstein.
the well' known attorney, was unfortunate
enough, however, to run afoul of Patrol
man J. B. Collins at 10 o'clock Saturday
night, the result being that he was igno
miniously carried to the O'Farrell-street
police station in a patrol wagon and book
ed at that- place on the charges mentioned.
There is considerable mystery about the
arrest of Reinstein and it was quite evi
dent yesterday^that every effort was be
ing taken by the attorney and his friends
to keep the matter a secret. That a wo
man was connected with the escapade in
some manner seems likely, but the arrest
ing officer now makes statements concern
ing the affair which differ materially from
the admissions made by him to Prison
keeper Riley at the police station at the
time, the â  double, charge was placed op
posite Keinstein's name. - .
According to Collins' nrst statement he
was patrolling his beat on Scott street,
near California, at. , the hour mentioned
when his attention was attracted to a
couple standing near the corner of the
streets named. The man appeared to fee
drunk and when the ohlcer demanded an
explanation struck him. The policeman
then placed him under arrest and booked
him on charges of drunkenness and bat
tery. The woman disappeared when the
arrest took place, according to Officer Col
lin's statement.
Collins refused yesterday to sign a com
plaint against Reinstein for battery and
when the matter was heard by Judge
Cabaniss it was at once dismissed.-Sub
sequently Officer Collins saidhe had made
a mistake and that he was extremely
sorry therefor. He declined to say why
he charged Reinstein with battery and
denied emphatically that there was a
woman with Reinstein at the time of the
arrest. ?
Reinstein explains the affair with the
statement that he was suffering from neu
ralgia Saturday evening and resolved
on an airing in order to ease his agony.
He walked aimlessly about the streets
and was resting against a; fence when he
was arrested. Other features of the case
he declined to discuss.
SUCCESS IS ASSURED
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL
Organizations All Over the State of
California Co-operate to Erect

Success is attending the energetic and
untiring efforts of the ladies composing
the executive committee of the George
Washington Memorial Association of Cal
ifornia. The women's club and the Na
tive Daughters and schools and other or
ganizations throughout the State have
taken the patriotic matter in hand and
already the subscriptions amount to $5600.
That the contributions may not be con
fined to a few persons an opportunity is
given to all in the State to contribute
small sums. , â¢ â 
The idea Is being vigorously exploited
throughout the State with most encourag
ing results, co-operation being promised
from all quarters. The promised' gift of
$10,000,000 by Andrew Carnegie will in no
way conflict with the work that is being
carried on by the Washington Memorial
Association. It Is the intention of the
executive committee to give a grand
colonial ball some time in February for
the benefit of the fund. The ladles who

ELECTRIC CAR
SMASHES WAGON
J. J. Fox, a Teamster, Has
Narrow Escape Prom
Death.
An electric car of the Turk street line,
traveling at a high rate of speed, collided
with one of Gray Bros.* heavy four-horse
teams shortly after 6 o'clock yesterday
morning and as a result J. J. Fox, the
driver, was very seriously injured. The
accident occurred near Gough street. The
car struck the front wheel of the un
wieldly vehicle. So great 'was the mo
mentum of the car that the front wheel
of the wagon, wuich was struck was com
pletely demolished and the left hind leg
of one of the horses fractured.
Fox was struck by the Iron bar pro
truding from the front of the car and
fell between the rails of the track,
but the wagon with its heavy load
of crushed rock acted as a barricade and
prevented the car from running over him.
Fox . sustained a compound fracture of
the collarbone, a fracture of the
right knee cap and a fracture of a rib
on the left side. He was placed in a car
riage which happened to be passing at the
time and removed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital.
The horse was so badly injured by the
collision as to proclude all possibility of
It recovering. A policeman subsequently
shot the animal in order to put an end
to its sufferings.
Fox, who is a regular teamster in the
employ of Gray Bros., resides with his
family at 915 Battery street. When the
acident occurred he was hauling a load
of crushed rock from Gray" Bros.' quarry
In North Beach. In describing the acci
dent yesterday afternoon at the Central
Emergency Hospital the injured w-n
said:
"The car struck my wagon with tre
mendous force. I am certain that the
gripman did not slacken his speed in the
least when he saw my wagon on the
track. While the car was fully a block
away I saw its headlight and com
menced to turn from the track, but the
wheels stuck In a groove and my wagon
whirled directly across the track. When
the car advanced within thirty feet of me
I called to the gripman to stop, but I do
not think that he even attemped to do
so." "
H. H. Abarr, who is also one of the
Gray Bros.* teamsters, witnessed the ac
cident. He also claims that the car was
moving at a very great rate of speed
Neither Abarr nor Fox heard the grip
man sound his bfll.
