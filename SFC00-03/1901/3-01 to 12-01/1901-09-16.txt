BODY TO LIE IN STATE AT CAPITOL
"When 3*r. Roosevelt yesterday asked
us to remain in office he accompanied' the
request with such generous and : sincere
expressions that we unanimously agreed
to comply with it. No one know* how
long it Â¦will be before any -change takes
place in the Cabinet." j
The relations between the new President
s.nd the old Cabinet are very, amicable.
A report gained currency to-day that at
his conference with the Cabinet yesterday
Mr. Roosevelt coupled his request that the
members remain in office with the state
ment that he would like them >to stay two
months at least. This is not : true and I
am permitted to deny the story on the au
thortiy of the President as well as of
members of the Cabinet who were present.
Postmaster General Smith, in discussing
the matter this evening, . said : â¢ r .- ~
I am also told to-day-' that, an .effort is
being made even now to bring President
Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury
Gage together at once so that Mr. Gage
should continue as the head of the Treas
ury Department. At this, minute; nearly
every one expects Mr. Gage to reiire. The
opinion is expressed by Mr.,Glage'sirIends
that he can be induced ; to " stay. He
knows Mr. Roosevelt and likes him. - . j
It is known there is a very â¢strong wish
oa the part of Mr. Roosevelt's friends. that
he induce Attorney General Knox to re
main in the Cabinet permanently. As to
Mr. Root remaining in the Cabinet there
is believed to be no question. He and
Mr. Roosevelt are friends of long stand
ing. They have been through so. much j
together and know each other so well that
it is pretty certain that Mr. Root will re
main, unless Ill-health some time in the
tuture should corm>el him to <juit.
I am given to understand that whila
Senator i^odge is likely to be offered tha
portfolio of biate, it is quite probable that
ne will decline. With Mr. ttoosevelt as
President the position of Senator Lodge in
the Senate will be that of spokesman and
personal representative ot tne administra
tion. That is a position . that will cer
tainly be much to Senator Lodge's liking.
He probably will also be chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations and. this
â¢would command influence and respect sec
ond to none in the Senate with the excep
tion of Senator William iFrye, President
pro tem. Â¦Â¦.' v â¢
The suggestion has been thrown out to
day that if Secretary Root ceases to be
the head of the War Department by be
coming Secretary of State, the position of
Secretary of War may be offered to Gen
eral Leonard Wood, at present Governor
General of Cuba. â¢ Â¦'-
President Roosevelt will not carry into
the Presidency any personal or political
resentment. The exploit of "shelving
Roosevelt" has terminated in his eleva
tion- Well and good. Rposevelt is will
ing to call ail things square and begin
over again. ...
BUFFALO, Sept. 15.â While Buffalo and
its tens of thousands of visitors have been
reverently filing past the dead President's
bier the new President, with grave ana
resolute face, surrounded by serious
minded counselors, has been looking into
the future and making plans for the pub-
Ik- good.

Mourning.
THE people of San Francisco tasted
of their usual Sabbath pleasures
yesterday, but under .the apparent
enjoyment were sorrow and
mourning. They went to the park
and Cliff, to the baseball game
â¢ and the coursing grounds simply
as a matter of passing time. There' was
a restrained feeling over allâ a shadow of
grief.
In the churches ministers of the gospel
urew lessons from, the dastardly crime
that ended the life of the nation's ruler.
Fervent prayers ami solemn services
brought back the picture of the gracious
President as he was known to San Fran
cisco during his visit. None the less sol
emn and none the less sincere was the
quiet grief of hi3 old soldier friendsâ and
there are several in San Franciscoâ men
who fought with him in. a common cause.
These comrades of the Civil .War wilt
come together within the next few days
and mourn for the departed with special
memorials of their own making. To them
the nation's loss is augmented by what
seems the severance of family tle3.
Thursday has been the day set aside for
the public funeral in Washington, and on
the same day memorial services will be a
part of the local tribute to the memory of
the dead. The committee of 100 appointed
by the Mayor to arrange for the local
services has been called to a meeting In
the Mayor's oftice at 11 o'clock this morn- i
ing. All plans will then be determined^
upon. Suggestions have been made for
the simplest of services^ â a. eulogy .pro
nounced by some â¢ well known public
speaker and sacred music. Of those men
tioned for the honor of pronouncing the
eulogy General Barnes seems to be the
most favored. The original date for the
first gathering of the members of the
committee was September 17, but owing
to the nearness of the day set for the
funeral the Mayor decided to call a meet-
Ing for the earliest time possible.
The Catholic churches will hold high
mass on Thursday morning. Ministers of
all denominations will on that day honor
the memory of President McKinley with
prayer and special devotions. Some will
take an active part in the public cere
mony, which wlll~.be the city's contribu
tion toward the nation's manifestation of
love for the martyred chieftain.- - 1
Hour by hour the city is adding to Its
robes of mourning. Many of the business
houses were draped In black yesterday,
and to-day the number of buildings sym
bolizing a national grief in their sable
dressings will be doubled. The draping
in black will now go on in earnest.
In the courts and governmental depart
ments business will be resumed this morn-
Ing. Provision will then be made for
postponement of all activity on Thursday,
the day of genrai mourning.
MACKAY WOULD BEVTVE
VIGILANCE COMMITTEES
Urges That Anarchists Be Summarily,
Dealt With Outside of the
Courts.
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â John "W. Mack
ay, who arrived on the St. Paul yester
day, immediately ordered Commercial Ca
ble offices in London, Paris. New York
and other cities with Postal Telegraph
offices draped in honor of the dead Pres
ident.
"Anarchists should be dealt with severe- Â¦
ly," I said Mr. Mackay. "We never had sj^'
good a Government in San Francisco and
Virginia City as during those years when
the vigilance committees were in control.
Every offender was tried by a' Jury of
twelve good men, and, if found guilty, ex
ecuted on the spot. Bad characters left
the country instantly on receiving warn
ing from the committee. ' It did not have
to be repeated.
"I hope newspapers and public officials
Â¦will urge immediate action. This shoot
ing down of good- men like Mc-
Kinley is a serious matter. It makes no
difference how brave a man may be, some
cowardly assassin with a noiseless gun
may shoot him from a roof at some unex
pected moment. Guards amount to noth
ing. Men have been assassinated' in tha
midst of their soldiers. Â» ..
"Summary Justice, properly executed..
will do the work. Driva the anarchists
out of America. Hang every one of them
caught in these crimes without dÂ«ay. Let
the movement begin with vigorous action
on the part of the community and they
will disappear when they find we mean
business. Every, anarchist arriving In this
country should be sent back by the next
steamer. The European police will attend
to them. They are shadowed everywhere
and they should be kept over there â hunt
ed down and promptly exterminated.
â¢ "The time has come for business men,
to take hold of this matter and settle it
in good shape. There should be no half
way measures. Let the papers help the
movement along, force Congress to make
a proper law at the earliest moment and
have the officials see that it -is executed.
Public sentiment will do the rest. The
Country will sustain such a movement anfc*.
make anarchy a thing of the past." â¢ )

LONDON, Sept. 16.â It would be almost
impossible to record in detail the remark

President McKinley, proofs of which are
continually arriving here. Not only 'has
King Edward commanded the court to go
into mourning for one week but- wherever
a public meeting of any kind has been
held or wherever a public man has had
occasion to speak expressions of horror
and sympathy have been heard.
In every place- of public worship yester
day, from St. Paul's Cathedral and Can
terbury Cathedral down, the preachers
made special references to the terrible
event, invoking God's blessing .upon the
United States and the American people.
Craithie Hurst, Balmoral, whose bells
have never been used before except on
occasions of national Interest, broke the
custom and announced the event to the
neighborhood.
Mr. Choate and staff of the United
States embassy attended St. Paul's Ca

Americans were in the congregation.
Car.on Scott Holland made a touching al

Many members of the diplomatic corps
and a constant stream of visitors inscrib

of sympathy were received from Earl
Cadogan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland;
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, the Duke
of Abercrombie, the Maharajah of Joolh
pore, Mr. Austin, the poet laureate, and
many other prominent men.
In accordance with a special army or
der to the guards at the St. James Palace
and at all other. points where guards are
mounted throughout the United Kingdom,:
honors were rendered yesterday to the
memory of President McKinley such as
are usually "accorded only on the death of
royal personages. The troops. wore crape
and the . bands played dirges. Funeral
marches were played In every church in
the kingdom. Canon Duckworth, preach

. The opening of the* twentieth century will
be in our memory and In that of. our kinsmen
one that drew us together in the sacred broth
prhood of sorrow. It will unite the former
friendship between the two great nations.
The morning papers again appear with
heavily leaded border and are almost en

tributes of sympathy and respect ever,
marked the death of any person but a
British sovereign. - '
Considerable editorial space is devoted
to a discussion of Mr. Roosevelt's probable
policy, a question which is exciting the
keenest curiosity throughout Europe and
may be said to border almost upon appre

âIt. was announced by another insurance
company that its agents had paid by
check on Saturday to Mrs. McKinley a
policy calling for $15,000. Reports that the
President carried insurance amounting to
$200,000 or more are not credited by leading
insurance men in this city. Several
experts yesterday placed the total amount
at not more than $75,000. .

tectives that sent him post-haste across
the continent at a time when the world
supposed the Eastern cities held the evi
dences of the fiendish preparations of the
chosen tools of the anarchists.
Captain McCloskey's Visit.
Inquiries made last night at the post
office at Monterey showed that the offi
cials there have no recollection of ever
having been asked for mall by a man
named Fred Nelman, while the two hotels
in Pacific Grove and Monterey have no
record of a guest of the name of Fred
Nelman having registered In May last. It
is possible that if the assassin was here
that he registered under another name
or that he secured rooms at one of the
many lodging houses in the two cities.
No mention had been made of a visit of
the President to Monterey, and It Is nat
ural, to assume that Czolgosz, reading of
the intended visit of the President to Pa
cific Grove, went there possibly from San
Francisco to watch his chance to ap
proach the chief executive. He may riot
have remained over night there, as a late
train leaves Pacific Grove for San Fran
cisco.
"What appears to be most suspicious
about that man is the fact that he did not
call again for any mail and he did not
leave Instructions to have any mail for
warded. The fact that he called for mail
showed that he expected letters and it is
the general rule for persons who .call for
mall and who leave the city to ask that
their mall be sent on to some other ad
dress. I did not see the man again in Pa
cific Grove. No mall ever came for Fred
Kelman at any time after he called at the
postoffice. I have seen a picture of the
President's assassin in the papers and it
looks like the man who called at the post
office. The picture, however, was not a
good one. It was a sketch. If I could see
the assassin or a good photograph of him
1 am positive that I could identify him be
yond possible doubt."
Suspicious Circumstances.
"The exact date I cannot recall, but I
am positive It was when the President
epoke -in the church here to the Grand
Army veterans who were in camp at the
time. I was in the Postoffice alone, and
the man in question came to the delivery
window and called for mail for Fred Nel
tnan. { "What impresses the matter clearly
In my mind is the fact that when I said
to him 'What name?' he replied 'Fred
Nelman' nnd spelled the name out to me.
I looko<3 for mall in that name and found
none and so told the man. He was within
two !>et of me and I saw his features
distinctly. He was a young man about
25 or M years old, with boyish face. He
did not look like a traveling man. He
was about five feet six in height and was
of slim build. I think he had a black
eJoueh hat on.
"TVhen I read in the papers of the shoot
ing of the President and read that name
Fred Xeiman. by which the assassin was
known. I recalled at once that a man of
that name was in the postofllce asking
for mail just about the time that Presi
dent McKinley visited Pacific Grove. As
near as I can remember, the man came
into the postoffice late in the afternoon.
Czolgosz lay in wait for the President
at Pacific Grove, presumably because at
that town was being held the Grand
Army of the Republic encampment, and
McKinley had Eaid that whatever befall
he would not pass his old comrades by.
The would-be assassin knew that the
President would be driven through the
streets to the hall where the veterans
were assembled, and possibly he hoped
that on this drive the President's body
guard would be less vigilant than on oc
casion of receptions in larger cities. But
his expectation was not realized and the
opportunity he sought was fortunately de
nied hfm, not only there, but throughout
the Presidential trip.
While in Pacific Grove Czolgosz called
at the postoffice to Inquire for mail. He
had expected letters there addressed to
his alias, "Fred Neiman." He gave that
name to Postmaster Charles G. Chamber
lain, even spelling it out in his anxiety
that there should be no mistake. Post
master Chamberlain now Identifies the
fair-haired young stranger who was so
licitous lest he should leave a letter be
hind as the assassin who cowers in his
cell, safe from the wrath .Qf the mob that
clamored for his blood, but awaiting the
certain doom of death on the gallows.
Chamberlain knew the moment that he
paw the newspaper pictures of Czolgosz
that the face was the same that peered
In at him through the delivery window on
the memorable day of the visit of the
President. The circumstances of the in
quiry for mail were unusual, and in the
Postmaster's mind there is fixed indelibly
a pjcture of the harmless looking Pole
whose will was intent upon the most
heinous of purposes. Chamberlain re
members the expression of the man's face,
his complexion, the color of his "eyes, his
height, his build and even his
dress, and there can be no doubt that the
man for the moment appearing under the
alias of "Fred Xeiman" was none other
than Leon Czolgosz.
Postmaster Chamberlain's Story.
Presidpni^-McKinley visited Pacific
Grove-Saturday, May 11, being driven
there from the Hotel del Monte to ad
dress the veterans gathered at the Grand
Army encampment. Chamberlain himself
is a Grand Army veteran and has lived
in Pacific Grove for many years. He
stands high in the estimation of all who
know him and Is a man of splendid in
tegrity. His story, given to The Call's
j-pecial correspondent last night, is as fol
lows:

of the plotâ an end which is given first im
portance by Information which has come
into possession of The Call.
Leon Csolgosz was In Pacific Grove
when President McKinley was there. His
identification is complete and positive,
and it remains only for the great New
York detective and the local Havrkshaws
to visit the seaside town to gather there
conclusive evidence of th? long existence
of the hellish plot.

EULOGIZES THE
NOBLE PRESIDENT
Law is a schoolmaster to fit us to be freÂ«
and its present condition and character is a
measure of our present development in all
that goes to advance the welfare of the race.
Law in itself Is not opposed to liberty, but
is at once its child and its protector. In the
name of liberty the anarchists strike at free
dom, in the name of humanity they assail
mankind, in the name of love they apotheo
size hatred and let loose the hounds of hell
to produce the holiness of heaven.
Anarchists should be sent from all over
the world to an Island and be allowed to try
their experiments, but with no facilities for
reaching the mainland or returning to civili
zation. . - . . .
We might well pronounce eulogies upon
our departed ruler and friend. He was a
good. true, honest, unselfish man who had
worthily filled a great variety of important
public positions. But this is not so much the
murder of William McKlnley as the at
tempted assassination of a nation. The vil
lain's pistol-crack on- this continental holi
day, surrounded by the- triumphs of human
genius, heard by representatives of almost
every people on the globe, was a shot at y^u
and me, our America and the freest govern,
ment on earth.
We are paralyzed with a sense of mystery.
"We know how the murders of Lincoln, and
Garfleld can be explained by natural causes,
but of this "murder most foul, strange and
unnatural" we fall to comprehend fully the
underlying: cause that armed and moved the
assassin who was so obscure and wrought
his dark deed so suddenly as to makÂ« it
seem almost impersonal.
Four months ago we welcomed to our
sunny land "McKlnley, the kindly,"' and
now we gather to cry, "Hall! and farewell!"
No. man fully knows the meaning: of this
strange bolt from the empyrean, and It is
too soon to speak with the profoundest wis
dom and yet it is Impossible for us to speak
of anythinz else. - -

Bishop McCabe was unable to preach on
account of deep emotion and Dr. E. Mc-
Clish, president of the University of the
Pacific, took his place. He spoke of â¢'Mc-
Kinley, Man and Statesman," and said;
"He lives now more than ever: his "hand
will be on ages to come as are the hands
of Washington and LincoLn. for the best
of him. the immortal part" that Jcannot- be
touched by the assassin's .bullet, is still
ours."
At the close of the sermon Bishop Mc-
Cabe arose and in a voice choked with
emotion* and tears streaming- down his
cheeks, asked the congregation to sing
with him the President's last words:
"Nearer. My God, to Thee."
This afternoon Bishop McCabe ordained
the following young men into the ministry
of the Methodist Eplscopa? church: Elders
John J. Pardee. H. W. Baker, E. B. Win
ning, H. E. Milnes. Robertson Burley,
Yoshi Suke Sacon. Chan Lok Chang: Dea
cons, Hugh Baker, Amen Jung, James L.
Case. John M. Robinson, C. M. Warner, J.
U. Simmons, Charles O.- Oxnam. The
bishop also consecrated the following dea
connesses: Mrs. Mary A. "Wldeman. Miss
Ada L,. Applegate. Miss Lena B. Gray.
The conference held a memorial service
for the late President this afternoon. As
sembly Hall was packed to the doors with
sorrowing people and the absence of color
In dress was very marked. A large picture
of President McKlnley. draped In black
and surrounded by flaes. hune over the
platform, where it will remain till after
the funeral on Thursday, and white flow
ers decorated the chancel. The service
opened with the singing of "Thy Will Be
Done," after which the Rev. W. C. Evans
of Stockton, chaplain of the Ohio Society
of California and a long personal friend of
President McKinley, delivered the eulogy.
Dr. Evans said:
America to-day sits and weeps at the bier
of her best loved eon of this generation. For
the third time within the memory of living
men our nation is called on to mourn the pass
ing of a chief executive suddenly cu.t oft in the
midst of a life of usefulness by an assassin's
hand. Yet as we sorrow as a nation, we are
not alone. The nations of the earth sorrow
â¢with us and mingle their tears with ours for
our great leader, William McKinley. Â¦
For his assassin I have no words of un
brotherllness to-day, as he sits in a prison
cell, the object of wrath. But for those who
inflamed his poor weak brain with their awful
teachings, for the school of anarchy of which
he Is but the logical outcome, I have nothing
but denunciation and detestation, and I pray
God that the time will soon come when our
State and national legislation will be so strin
gent in its provision against this monstrous
evil as to stamp it out from among us forever.
The people of Novato and vicinity to-day
attended union services In Scott's Hall in
memory of President McKinley. There
were singing 1 and addresses. The Rev.
Father Byrne and the Rev. , G. B. Allen
spoke. The .services were conducted by
the Rev. E. R. Piepenburc.
SAX DIEGO, Sept. 15.â Services In all
of the churches to-day were character
ized by solemnity and in all of them ref
erence was made to the death of President
McKinley and in all prayers were offered
for Mrs. McKlnley. In view of the fact
that President Roosevelt has requested
that public services be hejd on Thursday
and because of an expressed desire that
the service be a union service. Mayor
Frary has called a meeting of the minis
ters of the city, to be held in his office to
morrow morning. It is probable that the
meeting- of ministers will arrange for a
meeting on Thursday.
WOODLAND. Sept. 15.â The Christian
Church was crowded this evening by
members of all churches who wished to
participate in the memorial services held
In honor of the late President McKlnley.
There was prayer, scripture reading and
appropriate song service. The speakers
and their themes are as follows: "Our
I>ead President as a Patriot," H. L.
Matthews: "Our Dead President as a
Christian." W. E. M. Stewart; "Our Dead
President as a Martyr." W. F. Fleenor;
"Our President and the Peojle," J. J.
Morgan.
The Jewish new year Is a cycle la time
and all that happens and all that Is to hap- ;

by Â¦word, by lire or by death, whatever
the calamities are, they are all ordained.
The greatest of all calamities that have
visited this nation was the assassination of
President McKlnley. This sorrow was or

was not to enter therein. It is singular
how frequently something like this hap
pens to shapera of human history. They
have a vision of great things to come for
their nation, things toward which thay
themselves have wrought, but their feet
stop on the threshold. The day before
President McKinley waa stricken he had
told the nation something of what he had
seen on his mount of vision as he took a
wider outlook, and then came the doom.
Hucb sacrifices cannot be wholly In vain.
Somehow rtiings must work out blessing
for the nation. Let this nation ponder well
that President McKinley waa shot, not
because of personal enmity, but solely be
cause he waa the embodiment of law anii
authority. - .

The ohancel was draped in black and

in addition to the programme of sacred

ThÂ«sre has be*n a widespread sympathy,
accompanied by tributes of praise for thÂ»

quarters. But there has been, more than
p ymrathy. Individual and national sympathy
h8Â« expressed Itself In prayer. This- has
arisen from no feellnir of panic. Peoples of

a tender sympathy for the President was
to believe in God's sympathy.

ANARCHY'S END
IS SIGNALED
After a week of watchinc the tolling bells
tell us the President Is dftd. We say of
him what Secretary SUinton eald of Lin
coln: "Now he belongs to the ages." We
cannot withstand death. Human sympathy,
medical Fktll and the united prayers of the
nation are futile. As well try to etay the
waves of the seas or the reddening of the
morning sky.
The beautiful loyalty to his home and
his fidelity. to his wif#, furnish an example
jvhieh is an inspiration to the whole world.
As President he reached the summit of
national confidence and renown. While his
spirit fills the Presidential chair the nation
Is secure.
Among the lessons we learn is that the
President's death does not retard the Gov
ernment from moving on. The people are
the Government, and while there are peo
ple there will be government.
We must not forget the causes of this
Â¦orraw. even while we mourn. We must
never forget them. Tragedies gather and

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
. ' Thornycrof t has launched one- of three torpedo-boats built
for the British navy. She is of the class numbered from 98 to
109; \ nine "in all, of which five more are to be built. They are
knots during 103U hours, with an average" horsepower
of -7047 'and a coal .consumption of 1.97 pounds,' the speed being
17.6. knots. The Minerva made a run of 2640' knots during 147
hoursâ an average "speed ' of ~ 17.98' knots per hourâ with 7007
horsepower and consuming coal at the rate of 2.06 pounds.
The maximum- power cf the Minerva was about 8700, while that
of the Hyacinth was : nearly 10,000 for two hours', and the" coal
used by the two ships on the return trip was 451 and 550 tons
respectively. The' radius of action based on the coal carried
and consumed is about 2030 miles for the Hyacinth and 3000
miles' for" the' " Minerva. The ships" are' indertticaVa's' to hulls,
but differ in engines and boilers, the Minerva being fitted with
the old-style Scotch boilers and the Hyacinth with Belleville
water-tube boilers. The failure of the latter was, chiefly due
to leaky joints, but serious complaint was also made over- the
Minerva's boilers. With the Belleville boiler out of the race
of competition as a steam generatorin "warships, the contest is
practically narrowed down to the Niclausse and. the Babcock
& "Wilson water-tube boilers. The former, which is of
French design, has had; a 1 good start of the American boiler
and has been introduced to the amount of 542,500 horsepower in
eleven, navies, partly as follows: Â¦-. Twenty-four ships, 225,000
combined" horsepower,' In the 'PrencK'navy; Russia and' Eng
land,; 4 ships each; United "States,- 6- ships of- 106,900 horsepower,
and Italy, 3 ships of 47,000 horsepower. The ship3 in our navy
for which the Niclausse boiler has -been selected are the new
battleships ; Maine, Pennsylvania ; and Georgia; Charleston 'Â¦ arid
Colorado, armored cruisers, and the monitor Nevada. It will
be â¢remembered that' the Spanish cruiser Colon, which made
such: a splendid run to escape capture at the fight off Santiago
.threei years ago,' was fitted" with- Niclausse boilers," and if the
engineer personnel had come up to the perfection of the ma

Navy building is progressing at a rapid rate in Germany,
three battleships having been launched within the last fifteen
months." . They, are all of the same type and size, namely 11,700

Non-inflammable wood has been abandoned In the British
navy, as in pur navy. The new armored cruiser Cressy, placed
in commission last May, is the first British warship fitted with
th^s material, and during this brief period it has been found
that the chemicals in the wood have greatly injured the offi
cers' uniforms, especially the gold lace and buttons. The fact
that the wood thus prepared would prevent fire. from destroy
ing ship and lives, as was experienced on board the Spanish
ships ' off Santiago, is evidently second ii> importance to thÂ©
preservation of the gold lace and gilded buttons of the officers*
uniforms. Similar reasons\are said to have prompted the dis
continuance of non-inflammable wood in our navy.

The corrected time and rounds of fire from the 13.4-lnch gun
on board the French coast defense ship Valmy at a recent trial
was four rounds in five minutes. The statement was first made
that five rounds were fired, 'but as the gun was loaded for the
first round, the actual rapidity is thus, reduced to four rounds,
or at the rate of one and a quarter minutes between fires. Tha
British battleship Royal Sovereign is credited with- six rotin&A
in twelve minutes, and the Empress of India with an Interval
between rounds of one minute and twenty-seven seconds, -while*
In the new battleships for our navy a rapidity of one and a
half minutes between fires is claimed to be sufficient for tha
12-inch guns.
160 feet by 17 feet, displacing 178 tons on a draught of 8.4 feet,
an<3 are. fitted with single screw engines of 2800 horsepower,
calculated to etve a speed of 25 knots with a load on trial of.
forty tons. There is' a marked difference between ther recent
designs of French and British torpedo-boats, the former, al
though smaller, having considerably greater draught and
therefore likely to be better sea boats. The French boats arÂ»
also fitted with twin screws, giving better maneuvering: quali
ties, so essential in vessels of this class. On the other hand,
the British boat engines being reduced to one-half of the for
mer practice, greater strength and more simplicity is obtained,

Interesting Trials by British Naval Vessels Prove That Both -the Old' 'Style Scotch ind the
Belleville Water- Tube Boilers Are Imperfect.
Some British promoters are talking of construct
ing a r railroad from Alexandria to Shanghai, so as to
counteract the Siberian railroad. The projected line
would be about 6400 miles long. The central portion
of it, however; would be composed of certain rail
ways' now. in operation in India, so that the'amount
of new road to be constructed would be only a little
over 3000 miles. Should the project be carried out
and Cecil Rhodes succeed in establishing his railway
from the Cape to Cairo, it would then be possible to
start from Cape Colony and travel through India and
China and thence back to Europe by way of Siberia
without change of cars, provided the British and the
Russians could be induced to work the systems to
gether. ' ,
TESTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FRENCH BOILERS
FOR WARSHIPS ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHERS
No information was obtained by the enumerators ' }
concerning the farming of '-the' Indian's/ but- it is
known from other sources that the natives are
making considerable progress in that direction. The
bulletin says: "Near some villages contact with
white men has taught the natives the use of improved
farmutensils,' but: in Â¦ other -localities they till Â¦ the 'land
; \vith staves and other crude, implements. ; The rriis-'
sionaries" are introducing modern tools., among the
.Inidians ; and instructing them in improved' methods of'
agriculture. The .establishment- : of . agricultural ex-'.
perimerit _ stations has been very .beneficial," and gives "
promise of. 'accomplishing. 'still' greater' results." ' r .

agricultural bulletin which will not require a hiap" to
help it out. ', -;;;' N
Most. of the- farms rare grouped around Juneau and
Sitka. 'â¢-' One is operated in connection with the Holy
Cross Mission on the -Lower Yukon/ and there are
a few small gardens in the villages # of the Yukon
Valley. The season between killing; frosts is too
short for the cultivation of cereals, but the long pe
riods of daylight, the comparatively high tempera
ture and the 'abundant rainfall, -which mark the brief
growing season, are favorable to the rapid growth and
early maturity of nearly all.kinds_ of vegetables. It
is therefore^probable the industry wiil - increase in
the' neighborhood of the, mining camps and other
settlements where there is. a good demand for; the
products. ' ' Â¦' 'â¢ ' Â¦ . f
Small, however, as were the results of farming in
Alaska during, the census year, the experiments in the
work oi growing foodstuffs in that frozen' country
were interesting. It is to be noted in the first place
that despite the fact that the land was v nominally free
it was by. no means cheap land. The report says:
"The main expense incurred by the settlers in open
ing farms has been in the preparation of the soil for
cultivation. TThis has been very high â in some cases
$120 per acre." With such a heavy cost for prepara
tion it is inevitable the farms shouldjbe small. Thus
out of 'the' twelve enumerated there are five that re
port less than three seres under three
contain over three arid less than ten acres, 'arid the
remaining four contain from twenty to forty-nine
acres each.
The record shows that in the summer of 1900 the
census enumerators found, twelve farms in Alaska,
comprising in the aggregate 159 acres, of which 104
acres is used for the cultivation; of. vegetables and hay,
while the rest is used for pasturage. The total farm
products 'of the year were' valued at $8046, vwhich is
certainly a very good result from so small an acreage.
When" compared with the population; however, the
agricultural returns arc seen to be very, slight. The
bulletin says: "The value of agricultural .products was
but 12.7 tents for each inhabitant of the Territory and
24.4 cents for each inhabitant of the'southern district
in which all the farms are located. This is in marked
contrast to the agricultural conditions in the States
and other Â¦Territories/- For each inhabitant of Ari
zona, for example, the average value of agricultural
products in 1899 was $57."

THE condition of trade expresses the stability
of the American people and the American re
public During the whole of last' week, up to
its tragic end, seventy millions of citizens, watching
-with grave faces the national sick bed at Buffalo,
-.vent about their business with American" calmness.
Though the originator of the remarkable, financial
and -mercantile polity which has* made the.
American a Â» creditor instead of a debtor . na
tion, and which has placed it at the head
of the moneyed countries of the globe, lay 'dyings
there was no '. financial disturbance of importance,
nor was any expected. But with characteristic pru
dence-the Government cast a cautionary anchor to
windward, and the Secretary of the Treasury an
nounced that he would swell the floating cash of the
country's financial center and thereby ease any ten
sion in funds. by purchasing bonds. The banks
loaned freely during the early days of the week, and
this helped matters along.
Still, on Frida}', when the sudden change in the
President's condition occurred, Wall street at once
weakened, and stocks went off from two to four
and five points, while call money went from 6 per
cent to :o per cent, though it' fell back to 6 per cent
before the close of the day. The announcement of
the President's death on Saturday morning was fol
lowed by the immediate closing of the ; exchanges
in New York, and indeed throughout the country,
but this action w?.s prompted by respect for the
illustrious. dead rather than by any intention to avert
a crisis. . In fact, on the last day of the President's
life, and consequently the last business day of the
week, the authorities of the New York- Clearing
house took no extraordinary action, for none was
needed. The mercantile business of the country, by
no means as sensitive as the stock and money mar
kets, has gone on precisely as usual ever since the
President was shot. The speculative markets, such
as that on the Chicago Board of Trade, flurried a'
little at first, as was natural, but almost immediately,
Â¦steadied. As for the general distributive trade of;
the country, that '".went on without a pause, and all',
parts of the United States reported business in *a
flourishing condition. The bank clearings showed
a gain of 54.8 per cent over the corresponding "week f
last year, New Orleans being the only important city
to show a falling off. - The failures were 182, against
167 for the same week last j-ear.
The great staples of the country showed little
change .during the week. The steel strike is a thing
of- the past, and in anticipation of this result the feel
ing in the iron and steel markets had been much bet-v
ter. Boots and shoes are quieter at Eastern manufac
turing centers, but are in good demand in the differ
ent distributing markets. Wheat is steady, though the
movement is not as jctivc. Dry goods are reported
in active demand, and all available supplies of cotton
goods are being' taken at firm prices. The export of
wheat ';cdntinues very large, the shipments for the
week being 6,648,000 bushels, against 4,666,000 for
the corresponding week 'last jear. Provisions have
ruled very strong, with an advancing tendency in lard
and bacon. Sugar has declined, but this is the only
important staple to exhibit weakness.
Business in our local market has been a reflex of
the Eastern situation for the past \veek. The strike
'.situation seems to be slowly clearing, and everyday
sees. more men at work. There is a general feeling
among the merchants that the disturbance is in its
Jast hours. As soon as it is over pronounced ac
tivity in many lines of trade is' anticipated. Other
wise local conditions remain. about. as' before.

This wonderful automaton can not only walk straight ahead,
but it can also perform the remarkable feat' of stepping over
an obstacle. The skin of the figure is made of aluminum; sup
ported by a strong framework of steel, and in the' back is a
small metal tube; about half an inch in diameter, through which i^
runs the electric current that controls the figure's move-.^*
ments. The only other connection between the figure and the
car is the chain from each hand to the vehicle. - The inventor
has formed a company, called the United ! States' Automaton
Company, with offices in Buffalo, N. Y., and it is proposed
to go into the manufacture of the figures on a large scale. It
is possible that the figure may be introduced into . warfare,
w^lch y?ill then become an affair of machinery to an even
greater extent than It already is.
and almost noiselessly, and can keep up a good pace for an
almost indefinitely long: time. Within the figure is a talking
machine, jvhich, on the occasion of a recent trial, said In a
clear voice, "I am going to walk from New York to San Fran
cisco." Two men will be carried in the little car drawn by the
automaton, and Mr. Perew says that \he figure can travel at
the rate of twenty miles an hour, or 420 miles per day, allowing
for three stops of an hour each. At this rate the figure would
cover the 3230 miles between New York ami San ' Francisco in
162% hours, or six days, eighteen and a. half hours..
One of the most interesting and remarkable of automata Is
j the ; electric man invented by L. P. Perew of jTonawanda, near
["Niagara" Fall's, New York. The automaton's seven feet five
! inches high and is clothed in , a suit of white duck; with a
! white yachting- cap upon its head. The feet are made of inflated
| india-rubber, and wear a pair of 13^ shoea. The hands are
Wonderfully life-like in appearance,' being brown, as if 'from
exposure to the sun and wind.' They hold metal / rings attached
to chains, which are connected with the car drawn by- the
automaton. When the figure is first set in motion there is; a
little whirring' noise, as though clockwork: had been' started.
After a hcsitatiAg step or* two the figure walks smoothly, evenly

THE DAY OF MOURNING.
Jersey City authorities have struck a body blow at
an ancient, respected and thriving industry. They"
insist upon preventing- druggists- from* selling""whisky
without a;prescription or a license. Local druggists
have much to be. thankful for in their condition. Â¦ I
It is,iherefore with every confidence in his character
and in his statesmanship that the people greet- their
new President. Had his accession come by any other
means than through the instrumentality of assassina
tion he would be welcomed to Washington with' the
plaudits of the capital, and throughout the country
the people would have joined in rejoicings from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. He enters office amid the
mourning of the republic, and no heart mourns more
sincerely than his. None the less the nation hails
him with loyalty and with trust, knowing that in his
hands, there will be continued unbroken the policy
of President McKinley for the peace" and' prosperity
and honor of our country.
Such being the case it is fortunate for the country
that the new President is not an unknown man, nor
cne untried -by the responsibilities of public office.
Although he has attained the Presidency at a younger
age than any 'of. his predecessors, President Roose
velt has not. reached it by a sudden bound. He has
inade his way upward from office to office and- has
had experience both in legislative and in executive
positions. He is known to be a man of singular
firmness of character. From first to last his career
has â¢ been marked .by acts which attest his - courage,
his indomitable will, 1 his patriotism and his integrity.
He has never been an imitator of any man nor a fol
lower of any man. Indeed, his personality has been
so original that it made him a noted man as soon as
he entered the arena of politics, and while yet but
a young and new member of the New York Legisla
ture he acquired a national reputation.
McKinle3 r . : A new influence is to emanate from the
office of the chief magistrate of the republic, and that
office is clothed with such great powers that the effect
of the change will be felt in almost every branch of.
the Government. There will Remain the old spirit
and the old. policy, but the one will be manifest
through a different individuality and the other will
be advauced by different methods. ;
There will be; however, a change in the .Govern
ment against which there can be no guarding. It
is not : permitted to any one man to adopt theper
sonality of another, or~ to exert that other's personal
influence. President Roosevelt will not be President
â¢Thus the country passes under, the control of a
new administration with no change from the. spirit
of that which has made the nation so prosperous and
has: so .completely won the* approval of the people.
It is of course foreseen that changes in the Cabinet
will 'soon come. Several' of the present Cabinet of
ficers desired to retire some time ago, and were in
duced to remain only by the personal solicitations of
their .chief. These will retire and new men will take
their places, but the great policies of^the administra
tion'will be upheld in their entirety and the business
of the Government will go on undisturbed. . â¢
UPON- being summoned to take the:' oath of
I office and assume the responsibilities of -Pres
ident of the United States Roosevelt prefaced
the act. with" the statement: "I shall take the oath at
ence, agreeable to the request of the members' of the
Cabinet, and in this hour of . terrible national be
reavement I wish to- saythat I shall continue abso
lutely unbroken the policy of President McKinley for
the peace and prosperity, and honor of our beloved
country." A little later he requested the members of
the Cabinet not to tender their resignations for the
present^ at least,* but to continue : in officvi," and the
request was complied with. " '-.

Colbnel Blngham, the/aid to" the ; Presi
dent, standing; ten feet 'below the foot of
the: casket, at the side of the loyal Cor
telyou, glanced in the' direction of the Rev.
Charles Edward Locke of the Delaware
avenue Methodist Kpisfcbpal Church, who
was to conduct the service.
The pastor was at the dobr leadlng'irito
the hall, a station whencehis words could
be.'heard at the head' of the stairs; The
signal was given and there welled out
from the hall the beautifuf words of
"Lead, Kindly Light," sung by a quartet.
It was President McKinley's favorite
hymn. Every one within sound of the
music knew it and half of those in the
room put their faces into their hands to
hide their tea.rs; Comptroller Dawes leaned
against a bookcase and wept. President
Rooseevlt seemed to be swaying to and
fro,- as if h!s footing' were insecure. '
When the singing ended the clergyman
read from the'word'of the'fifteenth chap
ter of the First Corinthians. All had risen
as he 'began and "remained - standing
throughout the remainder of the service.
Agrain the voices rose with the worda of
"Nearer. My- God, to Thee-," the very
words President McKinley had repeated
at intervals of consciousness during: the
day of agony before he died. As the music
died away the pastor spoke again.
"Let us pray," he said, and every head
fell upon its breast. . He began his invo
cation with a stanza from a hymn eung in
the Methodist church. His prayer was as

Funeral Cortege" Loaves the' House.
AH present joined in the Lord's prayer
as the minister repeated' Jt: President
Roosevelfs'voice was audible at theback
,of the room. The service concluded with
asimple benediction. ..The funeral director
was about to step '. forward to place ! the
cover on the casket when 1 suddenly there
was a movement behind .Governor Odell.
Senator Hanna, - who had risen, saw ; that'
the last onpcrtur.ity to look into the face
of-hls dead friend had come. Pressing for
ward, in an. instant he' was at the side of
the casket and bending over and looking
down into it. Almost two; minutes passed
and then he- turned' away and ;the coffin
was closed. " .. ' Â¦ . . -. .
Colonel Bingham ' signaled the bo'dy
bearers. Four Bailors, two Infantry ser
geants Land two artillery | sergeants bore
the casket aloft and ! out of the house? The
President, Cabinet arid the others followed
it. Mrs. - McKinley and the members of
the family, remained. "The widow had
passed through the- ordeal bravely and
without breaking: down. The trainld

Root and : "Attorney General .Knox and
Postmaster' General 1 Smith,- who i . had 'fol-
ing part in the state funeral in Washing
ton.
The day was gray and cheerless. Heavy
clouds hung over the city, at times break
ing to. let through a rift of sunshine and
shutting to let loose a downpour upon the
gathering multitude. The air was humid
and heavy and only a light wind from the
south stirred the drooping flags and the
emblems of mourning. 1ne very elements
seemed to lend : fitting accompaniment to
the scene of sorrow about to be enacted.
Eager. Crowds Are Kept Back.
Long before the time set for the funeral
services the vicinity, of the Milburn house
was astir, with preparations. At 9 o'clock
long plato6ns- of police .officers, mounted
and on foot, arrived at the grounds and
were posted in details along the streets
approaching the house. For a block: in
each direction the streets were roped to
keep back the gathering crowds. The
vigilance of the officers in keeping back
those not entitled- to 'admission witnlnthe
reserved area was redoubled. Those sum
moned to the service, the uniformed
escort of marchers and those whose busi
ness imperatively brought them there,
passed within j the four-square precinct
about the house where the body of the
dead chief reposed. * * â¢. ' :
Major General John R. Brooke, who was
personally- in command; of all the- forces
participating in the escort,, arrived at 10
o'clock. He was in fatigue uniform, with
service sword at his side. Aroundrhis left
arm was wound- a heavy band of : crepe.
With him were his aids and a half score
of other officers, all in fatigue uniform,
with badge of mourning' on their sleeves.
The time was now approaching for' the
services. . . ,-.Â¦Â¦-. ;
The tramp of the assembling military
could be "heard and the walk leading up
to the Milburn house began to be lined
with those who were '-.to - be
about the bier. Even amid the stir -of
assembling, a solemn and awe like silence
prevailed, and the division of the escort
came to their posts with silent bands.' '
Military and Naval Detachments.
At 10:30 the military and naval detach
ments took temporary station on West
Ferry street, immediately around the
corner from the Milburn house. First
came Companies I and L of the Four
teenth United States Infantry, stationed
at Fort Porter, under command of Cap
tain John R. M. Taylor, marching with
the steady tread and bearing of regulars.
Following them came a company of the
Seventy-third coast artillery now on duty
at the Pan-American Exposition, in com
mand of Captain John P. Weisser. These
Were the men who had been near I the
President at the moment he was shot and
who took part in the struggle with his
assassin. The National Guard of the
State of New York was represented by
picked companies from the Seventy
fourth and Sixty-fifth regiments, under
command of Captain Howland. _
Then the trappings of the military arm
of the service gave way to those of the
United States navy as fifty men from the
United States gunboat Michigan, under
command of Colonel L. T. Minnix, swung
into position alongside their military
brethren in arms. The naval contingent
had arrived only this morning in order
that all branches of the military, naval
and marine service might be fittingly rep
resented. At their head marched a de
tachment of marines, in their dark blue
uniforms and with large gilt-trimmed hel
mets. After them came the bluejackets
with open-throated shirts, their . loose
black neckscarfs in sailor knots, with yel
low leggings and sailor hats. Sailors and
marines marched with short carbines at
shoulder 'arms. The entire military and
naval force formed in company front on
"\Vest Ferry street and there awaited the
time for the services to begin. -/ '
Line of Distinguished Mourners.
Meantime the members of the Cabinet,
officials high in the Government service
and near friends of the martyred Presi
dent, began to till the walks leading up to
the entrance to the Milburn residence.
They came separately and in groups, some
walking. Secretaries Wilson and Hitch
cock drove up together and Governor
Odell of New York followed with his sec
retary and Representative Littauer of
New York. Following the Governor came
Major General Roe, commander of the
National .Guard of New York, with his
staff of aids, all in full uniform. Secretary
Root walked to the house with Mr. and
Mrs. Sprague, at whose house he J has been
a guest since first summoned to the city.
Two and two, a long line of men of dig
nified bearing marched up to see the house
âthe foreign representatives sent to the
exposition and after them the State Com
missioners. With the foreigners was a
colonel of the Mexican army in his full
uniform of black, with scarlet stripes and
peaked, braided cap. The other members
of the Cabinet in the city â Secretary Long,
Attorney General Knox, Postmaster Gen
eral Smithâ the close confidants and
friends of the late chiefâ Senator Hanna.
Judge Day, Governors Odell. Yates and
Gregory. Representatives Alexander and-
Ryan. Major General Brooke. E. H. But
ler, H. H. Kohlsaat and many other^ were
in the line. .
President Roosevelt Arrives.
It was just* eight minutes before the
opening of the service when a covered ba
rouche drove up' to the house, bringing
President Roosevelt and : Mr. . and Mrs.
Wilcox. at whose house he is a guest. The
President looked very grave as he alighted
and turned to assist Mrs. Wilcox from
the carriage. His face did not relax into
a" smile to those nearest the carriage, but
he acknowledged their greetings pleasant-
ty' and with an - inclination of the head.
Word passed up the. well-filled walk that
the President had arrived and those wait
ing to gain entrance fell back, rriakins a
narrow lane -through which- Mr. Roosevelt
passed along to the house. Â¦ :
As the President passed ' within .' ' the
house and the services were. about to be
gin- the longtime of soldiers and sailors
swung in columns of fours into Delaware
avenue arid formed in front
along the beautiful thoroughfare, opposite
the house and immediately facing it. On
the extreme left were the regulars, ;on the
right the sailors and marines and- in' the
center : the National Guardsmen. They
stood at parade k rest, with colors lowered,
each; flag wound about its staff and bound
with crape. The front of the house and
the lawns had been cleared by this time
and the sweep of the avenue was now de
serted save for the rigid, motionless ranks
across from-the house. : . . , - -
Hearse Plain and Somber.
The service had already begun when
down the avenue four high-stepping black
horses came Into view drawing the hearse
which was to bear the casket of- the dead
President. It was a heavy vehicle, with
out plumes or any trappings to relieve the
dead black. '.The . horses, too, were not
plumed or; caparisoned, and all four of
them r.were -black from nose to tip of .tail.
Two men were on the box, the driver with'
longlines to the tandem. pairs, and the
groom' with folded arms sitting motion
less. . Outside the house there was a half
hour of silence and waiting.. Within the
house of death was woe unspeakable:
In the drawing room to the right of the
hall as President. Roosevelt entered the
dead . chieffiMn was stretched upon . his"
bier. His head-was to the rising sun.
On his face was written the story of the
Christian' fdrbearnce with which he had
met his martyrdom. Only the thinness of
his face bore mute testimony to the pa
tient sufferings he had endured: lie was
dressed a.s he always â¢ was in life. The
black frock coat was- buttoned across'the
breast Where the' first bullet of "the assas
sin'had struck: The black string tie be-,
low' the standing collar showed the little
triangle of white shirt front. The right
hand lay at hia side; the left" was across
his breast. He looked as millions of his
countrymen had seen him save for one
thingâ the little badge' of the' Loyal Le
gion, the only decoration he ever wore;
which was always in the left lapel of his
coat, . was missing. And those who re
marked it spoke of it, and after' the' body
was taken to the City Hall the little
badge which he prized .through life was
placed again- where it had always been.
Simple' "Floral Tributes.
The body lay in a black casket on a
black bearskin rug^ Over the lower limbs
was flung the starry banner he' had loved
so welh The flowers were few, as befitted '
the simple natiiie of the'man. A spray of
white chrysanthemuma, a flaming bunch
of blood-red American beauty roses $nd
a magnificent -bunch of violets were on
the casket. That was all. Behind- the,
head, against a pier mirror between- the
two curtained-windows, rested two supqgb
wreaths of white asters and roses. Th^re
were the only" flowers in the room. " â¢ -:,.
Two sentries, one from the sea" an'd one
from the land, guarded the remains: They
stood in the window embrasures behind
the head of the casket:,. The one' i to the
north was a sergeant of infantry. In the
other" window was the sailor, garbed : in
the loose blue blouse of the navy.
The family had taken leave of their
loved one before the others arrived. Mrs.
McKir.ley, the poor, grief-stricken' widow,
had been led into the chamber by her
physicjan. Dr. Rixey, and had sat a while
alone with him who had supported and
comforted her' through all their years of
wedded' life. But though her support was
gone she had not broken down. Dry-eyed
she gazed upon him and fondled' his r face.
She did not seem to realize that he was
dead. Then' she -was ' led away by -Dr.
Rixey and took up her position at "the
head of the stairs, where" she could hear
the services.
Mrs. Hcbart, the widow of the Vice
President during Mr. McKinley's first
term; Mrs. Lafayette Me Williams of Chi
cago, Miss Barber, Miss Mary. Barber and
Dr.Rixey remained with her. The other,
members of the familyâ Mr. and Mrs. Ab
ner'McKIniey, Miss Helen McKinley, Mrs.
Duncan, Miss Duncan, Mr. and Mrs. Bar
ber and .Dr. and Mrs. Bacrâ had with
drawn into the library to the north of tile
drawing room, in which the casket .lay,
and here also gathered other friends when'
the service was held.
Men Overcome by Grief.
The friends and public associates of the
dead President all -had opporunity to view
the remains before the service began.
The members of the Cabinet had taken
their leave before the others arrived.
They remained seated beside their dead
Chief while the sad procession viewed the
body. They were on the north side of it.
A place directly at the head had been re
served for President Roosevelt. Secretary
Root sat alongside this empty chair. Then
came Attorney General Knox," Secretary
Long, Secretary Hitchcock, Secretary
Wilson and Postmaster General Smith in
the order named.
About a hundred in .all saw the body.'
Some were so overcome with grief at the
sight of the thin, placid countenance that
their frames shook in convulsive sobs.
Several clung to the side of the bier and
with difficulty could be persuaded to
leave. Almost every face was tear
stained. The great love for this man
choked all in the housel
Â¦Among those in the processiop 1 were
Senators Fairbanks .and Burrows, Gover
nor Yates of Illinois, Comptroller Dawes;
General Manderson and Mrs. Manderson,
Representative Littauer of New York, ex-
Postraaster .General ''William L. Bissell
At 12:25- o'clock/the police" were notified
that the body, could.be viewed by the peo
ple. A minute later and the first" of the
; lorig; line came through the doors;^ Sol
emnly, they moved' on past: the bier
to? view; Â«the "face of - the" President.
.Old men and- weak women, and strong
men jind children," lcaders'of men and la
borers, all Were represented in the throng
that filed past. " During the tlrst hour the
.people | passed the ' catafalque at the rate
of 115 a- minute, and; at the .end. of . the
first\hour it . was .estimated' that 500i' per
sons^ 1 had passed Â¦ the i bier." Outside" ,the
lines ' were: amazing' in their' dimension's;
solid masses of .people stretching for half
a mile :lri' either, direction. â¢ Distinguished
persons took/ their, places in" the 'line : at 3

hours the function: was rendered disagree
able by : a violent rain, but at , 5 o'clock
the' heavens- cleared." .The crowds * grew
larger, and it : was decided to - leavq the
City Hall! open indefinitely. On througn

and?, at 10 o'clock to-night' there seemed
to be no end to'it. ".The police : w'ere finally

stretched from the harias" of the soldiers

the ...throngs.'' . Â¦'. _ " ;
The casket ; was immediately opened to
its fullest 1 length. An American l!ag was
thrown acrossthe^foot of the casket, and
resting against it were wreaths of roses.
;. A moment of silence prevailed. Then
President Koosevelt- nodaed' to Secretary
Root and side by side' they left the scene
by the .rear doors,'- followed by tiie other
members of : the Cabinet, v
Tnousands View the Body.
This design occupied tha central place
in the: southern line ' of palm's.' . Later
superb- pieces" from the Milburn house
reached the City Hall and were given
places in the system^ of decorations: Of
striking beauty, was a white wreath, bear
ing-in immortelles the name' "Chile."
Circled ' about :the bier was a' distinguished
company. To. the left stood President
Roosevelt, at his left ......lOrney . General

The arms of the chandeliers were wound
with black, and white; with altar crosses.
A : radiator] was swallowed up in L a' mass
of funeral ' color, and back of this : im
promptu altar there spread out space not
unlike a Â¦ chancel, â¢ all in black and white:
Behind it all" floated another American
flag ''Â¦ of generous -proportions. The inclo="
ure for the catafalque was surrounded by
.banks of '..palms..., .'.T.hpre were;, pandans,
arecas, kintias, bay trees, phoenix, incla
nata-and rattta, worked into the general
scheme of decoration. There was but one
set 'floral piece. This was a 1 contribution
from the French .Society of. Buffalo. It
consisted of two flags, United States and
French, on standards of the drapings of
purple and black, caught in. the beak- of
a .pure white dove, framed in the -words,
"With Syriipathy and KegreT."
Below on the. tiled floor of the corridor
rested the' catafalque. It was- covered
with the' same costly cashmere, relieved
by six knots of generous proportions of
satin material. Its head rose eighteen
inches from the floor and made a gentle
angle, allowing- the bier, to slopa to the
foot." Stairways- flanked two ! sides of the
corridor." The balustrades* were- .hiddejr
from view beneath the conventional garb
of mourning. Mounting the stairway
posts were chandeliers of six : lights, burn
ing low. - - .'â¢ . , - -.. . Â¦ . . . .
Entering- the. main vestibule, from
Franklin street the vision was; greeted!
with the" graceful sweep of festoons* of
black 'and' white cashmere: The drapery
ascended from the floor to the ceiling and
dropped to the moldings, where, it wan*
caught in bows of -deep black," ;therice" to 1
follow downward the contour of the build
ing. A mammoth column situated halt
way ' between " the -side walls- of Â¦ the vesti
bule served to develop th,e arches. The
column 1 itself, reaching to, the, ceiling; be-,
came a: monument of mourning in its
garb of black. Color was lent" by large
pictures of the martyred Presiderit, fast
ened on either side of the column, while
champion' pieces" of â¢ 'like'' dimensions
adorned the walls. Many yards of drapery
converted the" rectangular spaces demar
cated by the : column and the walls into
two- arches' of imposing proportions, af
fording entry to the main corridor, where
had been constructed the canopy of state
under which the dead President was to
repose while Buffalo's people by the thou
sands- paid-^thoir -last respect*.' Leaving
the arches, the elevator ; snaf ts on either
side" w'ere literally hidden from view be
hind a\perfect sea of black. Above the
central point of \ the corridor, directly
under the floor walls, was fashioned the
state canopy. , "Wttite and black cashmeres
of costly price ' floated down in graceful
lines from a point high up in the building.
The purity of the white alternated with
the somber of Â¦ the- black, reaching down
in : French Â¦ drapes with festooning of
beautiful simplicity. Dropping down in
impressive grandeur "were four of the
country's flags, so' hung : as to burst forth;
into a cross.-

At'the- same instant' precisely the' rain
cahi'e' down in : sheets and, driven along by

The. casket ! was lifted ) from the' hearse

respecting his â¢ dead President. Inside;
with steps impressively slojv and meas

Testerday was a quiet day/among the
yachtsmen. The Sausalito and Tiburon

flags at half-mast. There were no regular
cruises. The following yachts cruised to
McNears Landing: The sloops Cygnus,
Sapho, Mischief, Juanita, â¢ Dewey, Har

breeze took the yachts up to the Landing,
but on the return trip the wind fell light
off California City. It was nearly 7 o'clock
before the boats made their moorings.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy's schooner

Society, which opens at Emeryville track
this afternoon, has aroused general inter
est among horsemen. Not only will the
pick of the running division be seen, but
all the crack harness horses which par
ticipated in the racing at Sacramento.
While the sport at the last named- meet
was good, it .should be surpassed at
Emeryville, as the class of- entries will
be higher. Favonius, Rosewar and other
cracks of the Burns &. Waterhouse stable
are here after their Chicago campaign and
will be seen at the barrier. Charles Patter

Champion James J. Jeffries and his

opportunity yesterday of seeing one an
other In action. The occasion was a bene
fit for the striking machinists and the
place Armory Hall. Market and Tenth
Btreets. Both boxers appeared In the
ruddiest of health, Jeffries in particular
being almost In condition to enter the ring
and defend his title to the championship.
Jeffries had as sparring partner his
brother Jack. They went three fast
rounds, the big fellow devoting most of
his time to ducking and side-stepping the
vicious swings and jolts of his brother.
The champion was on top of his opponent
all the time, giving him but little oppor
tunity to score effectively. His footwork
iÂ» a revelation In quickness when his
great bulk is taken into consideration.
Huhlin has taken matters easy in his
training, as their meeting la still two

Billy' Madden, his trainer, says Me

yesterday with "Denver" Ed Martin, who

San Francisco 4, Sacramento 0.
The German aggregation, with "Hine"
Kru3 doing," 1 pitshir's stunts, proved too
strong for tho. Statesmen yesterday at
Recreation grounds. While four of Uncle
Hank's pets mat 1 * the rounds of the bases
not a solitary Senator could find his isay
home. Hard luck proved s.n important
factor for Sacramento, however, as they
piled up six. safe. drives, but whenever a
hit was I really needed they- were found
woefully .lacking. McNeely's work in the 1
box was gilt-edged, but the locals man
aged to bunch their few hits at the right
time.
The Wasps began to. find McNeely in the
fourth round., Hildebrand started It with
a double, took third on Schwartz's hit
and. scored on Hanlon's error, which also
put Pabst on tli e initial bag-iind Schwartz
on the third station. At this juncture
Josh Reilly Hn^d out a pretty single and
both. men came home. . Â¦, Â¦â¢_:.
Â¦ Krug was tho fourth German to make
the round trip. In the sixth,' after Pabst
had been called out at the plate on a
doubtful decision, Krug managed, to make
third on a two-bagger and an out. Shay
was on first and started down to second,
and while the Senators were busily occu
pied in catching him between the bases
"Hine" crossed the, rubber. The board
read San Francisco 4. Sacramento 0, re
maining so -until .the ena.
The. men from the capita:;, were never
within 'striking distance of the coveted
home, plate. On two occasions they be
gan to bunch their hits, but the sharp
fielding of the. Dutch put a damper on
their hopes of sreoring.
An immense crowd was in attendance,
and it was a. 'Frisco crowd through a*nd
through. Perhaps it was the rooting that
Tielped* the locals to win. They put up an
exhibition of ball worthy of the National
League. Hildebrand, Doyle, McLaughlin
and Shay were the shining stars, each
man .accepting.. some hard chances for
their respective teams. .The, score:

San Francisco 4, Saci amento 2.
The morning game at Oakland went to
San Francisco by a score of 4 to 2. Hof
fer and, Whalen did the honors on the
slab for their respective teams. Whalen
was a bit wild, passing seven men. but
his curves were .hard to find, only three
hits being counted against him. The
Dutch hit Hoffer safely el.sht times, but
he allowed only two to walk.
Krug Uned the ball over the fence In the
sixth, which cinched the game. Devereaux
did not have his batting eye with him,
and made the Sacramento fans groan by
striking out three times. The score:

the hope that; God-, would prevent the

able that the President had been assas
sinated, and declared that although he
was elected tb office by the people he

LATE SHIPPING* INTELLIGENCE.
Buled by Will of God.
At. the Central Methodist Church* last
night solemn memorial services were held.
The occasion was one of unusual solemn
ity, not only, because of the heartfelt
sorrow which was displayed over the un
timely death of the nation's first citizen,
but because the pulpit was filled by Dr.
Thomas B. Neely, D. D..-LL. D., of Penn
sylvania, who is considered one .of 'the
leaders of the Methodist denomination. In
keeping with the occasion, the music was
appropriately solemn and impressive. The
church was filled to its greatest capacity.
Dr. Neely in his sermon pointed out the
principal events in the life of McKinley
and paid an eloquent and touching tribute
to his virtues and noble characteristics as
a man, as a husband and as a citizen. In
his death he declared that the nation and
the .world had sustained a loss which
would not be soon filled. He stated that
the sympathy of the nation was with the
sorrowing wife in this, her hour of grief.
In tracing the President's course
through /life* he called attention to
fact- that he had risen "to the highest
position in the gift of the American people
from a very humble beginning. In speak
ing of the foul deed of the assassin he
condemned it as ah act of insane violence
and declared that laws should be passed
guarding against such acts in the future.

After the note had been given to- tha
police Detective Dillon called on Mrs.
Ecks. but was unable to get any informa
tion from her. She says she ' knows ' no
man named Franklin ant! thinks the af
fair a hoax. Dillon could find no clew as
to who the writer of the message
might be. - . ... .' ;
A message written on the back of a
weather bulletin and tacked up in tho
railway station at Lands End was made
the subject of a police investigation yes
terday. The not& was signed by a per
son purporting to be F. H. Franklin and
contained the announcement that the
writer had committed suicide. ., It ccn
talned a request that Mrs. Ecks of 1130
Buchanan street be â¢ informed of the
writer's death. The fact that no Body
has been found and that the lady men
tioned disclaims the acquaintance of any
man of that name adds mystery to the
case.
Albert Robinson of 945 Howard street
found the message. It read:
Sept. 12. 1901. .
I jumped overboard about 10 a. m. this morn
ing at Lands Knd. If found please let Mrs.
Ecks know of my death. Good-by forever. My
last nickel was spent for carfare.

It will be necessary to have Czolgosz in
court at 9 o'clock to-morrow, when the
indictment against r.im is reported, so
that he may plead to the indictment.
Czolgosz insists he wants no lawyet and
is willing to plead guilty.
The three policemen and Czolgosz. thus
attired, slipped out of the door and into
a carriage. The .departure was unnoticed.
In three minutes, the carriage stopped at
the jail entrance, where a half-dozen dep
uty sheriffs surrounded the prisoner and
he was hurried to a cell behind three sep
arate sets of iron gates.
BUFFALO/ Kept. 15.â Assassin Czolgosz
was to-day removed from police head
quarters to jail. The" manner of spiriting
Czolgosz out of headquarters was theat
rical. . Superintendent. Bull called a closed
carriage and ordered three patrolmen to
report to him. He took a policeman's hel
met and went to Czolgasz's cell. He set
the helmet on the assassin's head, took
off his own blue coat and said to Czolgosz:
"Put that on."
CZOLGOSZ IS TAKEN

President's Character.
These five essentials are heartiness, affln-
Uv for toll power of enthusiasm, thorough-,
tipss and. gentleness,, end added to them as
the life-giving element is moral principle. .
Tniliara McKlnley bad all of these in large
measure.
Concluding. Dr. McLean said he hoped
Presidents would be saved from
F-he tremendous ta*ks of greeting multi
tudeÂ«= upon multitudes that had undoubt
rdlv" lie believed, contributed, largely Â¦ to
Ban President McKinley's vitality and to
i*ave him weakened when the assassin's
bullet struck him. The clergyman gave
a touching repetition of the story of the
Ko President since the days of Lincoln â¢"
*o enshrined in the hearts of the people.
To-day throughout the land there is a feel
ing of grief over personal bereavement that
a loved one has been taken when it seemed
' as if we could not spare him. as if his mis
eion was half performed. * But in the lan
guage cf our Lincoln "this is a government
of the people, for the people and by the

President McKinley came from the people.

and it was his conscientious desire to do his
duty that he could thus win the approval of
the people. - -

The closing address was by Dr. Mc-
Lean who spoke upon the moral charac
ter of President McKinley, pointing out
firs* that there were high essentials to a
moral character based on practical and
not ethical lines. The clergyman said:
Compared With Lincoln.
Xo one who ever saw or heard President
McKinley can ever forget his kindly face
and his benignant Gir.ile. We labor under
the grief of a personal lossâ we who only a
short time ago had the privilege of meet
ing him as a Magistrate and as a man. He
had a sincere affection for his country. His
speeches were wise, and no public man since
the days of Blalne rver uttered so many
ideas with such uniformity of character.
President McKinley will survive himself.
The forward march of the republic will not
be stayed. The nation will wipe away
its tears. The present and future are ours
for all things.

From his sick chamber at Buffalo Mc-
Kinley preached the most eloquent sermon
ever heard by the American people. Mil
burn houpe wan a pulpit whence he spoke
to the whole world of patience, confidence
and submission to God, and his last utter
ance will go down into history as a fitting
exponent of the nobility of the man...
Reference to the assassination of the
President was made by the Rev. Frank S:
Brush. . pastor, of. the First" Presbyterian
Church, in his morning sermon. In part
he said:
It is the very beauty of the man's char
acter, his fidelity and devotion to the people
that makes the tragedy at Buffalo so das
tardly. It la not the striking down of a
tyrant nor the removal of an oppressor.
It was not even the avenging of an injury.
AnarchistB are banded together for the ex
press purpose of destroying everything that
makes for righteousness and happiness and
prosperity. Anarchy is nothing else than
a mustering of the forces of evil to wipe
out all that is goodâ law, religion and
morality.
There is a great man fallen this day in
Israel. We come together in the shadow
of a great national calamity. The land is
in mourning. The streets that ecarce four
months ago were decorated in bright colors
in honor of the nation's ruler in our midst
are now draped in black. The world shares
our Brief, and as if in witness to the
solidarity of the Anglo-Saxon race the Hags
are half-masted over Westminster Abbey,
and the heart of the multitude goes out in
tender sympathy to her who is now
widowed. In the passing of the President
we have lost one who embodied in his own
character the highest ideals of American
manhoodâ courage, purity, integrity, sturdy
patriotism. Every mother in this land
could point her boy to the President and
nnd In him a pattern worthy of imitation.
McKinley's legacy to the young men of
America is his Etrong, noble,' Christian
character. . '
ALAMEDA, Sept 15.â Memorial services
In honor of President McKinley were held
this evening in Christ Episcopal Church,
where the rector, the Rev. Dr. T. J. Lacey,
spoke feelingly of the late President in
the presence of a large congregation. The
chancel was decorated with flags and
mourning drapings and the service, which
was authorized by Bishop Nicholls, was
deeply affecting and impressive. The Rev.
Edwin Johnson, the assistant rector, pre
sided over the services. Dr. Lacey's text
was taken from II Samuel 111:38. He said

CHICAGO, Sept. 13.â With the finding In.
the water at the foot of. Peck street to
day of the body of M. G. Vanderburg, a
wealthy resident of the Netherlands, an
associate of American capitalists and a
guest at the Auditorium Annex, the mys
terious death of Stella Cook last Tuesday
night was cleared. Miss Cook was not
murdered, according .to the present belief
of the police, but lost her life with Mr.
Vanderburg by the overturning of a boat
in which they were rowing.
The discovery of the Hollander's body
not only cleared the murder mystery, but
dispelled the cloud of suspicion that has
settled about Harry Thurston, cook on
the steamer City of Traverse, and com
panion of the. dead girl.

charging him with guilty knowledge of
the girl's disappearance, will probauiy be

The role, a favorite with all the great
actors' of the so-called legitimate school,
from Macready to Booth and Barrett. Is
one of the strongest in Mr. 'Ha worth's
repertoire and is among themost power
ful conceptions in dramatic literature. It
affords the actor a magnificent oppor
tunity for the exercise of. all those quali
ties that go Jlo make the great player, and
"Richelieu," Bulwer's great play, will be
seen at the Grand Opera-house this week,
with Joseph Haworth in the name role.
Von Suppe's "Beautiful Galatea," Mae
Tunison, the Bernards, Kalacratus, Billy
Knight, Dllges and Mabel Martin are the
attractions at Fischer's this week. The
Von Suppe operetta has proved itself a
very popular addition to the regular pro
gramme, and is received nightly with
hearty applause.
.^'Yr'-^HE Orpheum bill this week is one
.,.' | J of the best, with turns to suit all
| i tastes, and Ernest Hogan besides.
.- JJL> Always after the "unbleachejd
"American,'' the" chief " novelty
of the week Â¦. is a monster musical
instrument, labeled a "giant myriophon"
by its inventor, Mr. Karsy, a sort of bi
cycle and mandolin combined. It Is really
a wonderful affair, with about twenty-five
rotating discs of varying sizes strung w.lth
wires, bicycle fashion, set in rows to a
height of eight feet or so and played by
the inventor and his wife with hands, feet
and anything else that comes handy, with
an effect like a forest of mandolins. They
gave the intermezzo from "Cavalleria
Rustlcana" "and a "Faust" selection last
night to satisfying applause and the ar
tistic setting of the act added not a little
to the pleasure it gave. Dorothy Mor
ton, late of comic operaland and a . stun
ning sort of person, is another new-comer
to the Orpheum and sings with much chic
and abandon. She was suffering from a
slight sore throat last night, but carried
off her indisposition with such grace and
good humor that she won a place as first
tavorite with the sympathetic audience.
The Delmore sisters present one of the
prettiest tableau series we have seen here,
entitled mysteriously "The Bridegroom's
Reverie," that is costumed and lignted in
unusually elaborate fashion. The sketch
is illustrated with fit and fetching vocal
and- violin music, but furnished with a
very inadequate verbal description by- a
gentleman who seems to earn his salary
smoking cigars. Stella Lee. a pretty and
featly footed comedienne, danced herself
into strong favor with the house. Marsh
and Sarteila added their little quota of
entertainment.- Ernest Hogan has some
new coon songs and sings them in the
same old way to the high satisfaction of
his hearers. "Chums," with George- W.
Leslie and company, goes even better this
week than it did last, and with Libby,
Trayer and Gilbert in their amusing skit,
"The Debutante," the good programme
ends. . Â¦ .-- ;. .
The new bill which opens at the Chutes
to-day includes CLyn ton and Wilde, sketch
artists; James J. Mackey, author and
comedian: Camella and Amelita, Spanish
dancers; Val Vousden in character imper
sonations. Ada Sweeny in illustrated
songs, and the famous Standard Quartet.
A series of new moving pictures will also
be shown. . .
. â¢ "A Voice From the Wilderness" is the
third repeat bill of the week, and the big
spectacle Is still crowding the Central
Theater at every performance. It is going
smoothly now, every one has fallen into
their parts, and admiration for the mount
ing of the drama is still at high pitch.
Next week "Little Lord Fauntleroy" will
be put on. â.
At the Alcazar "The Taming of tho
Shrew," In which Miss Florence Roberts
has been so favorably seen during the last
week, will be repeated. It has been one
of the best performances of the Roberts'
season at -the Alcazar, well balanced in
the cast and with happiest opportunity
for the principals. Miss Roberts has sur
passed herself as Katherine, and 'White
whittlesey's Petruchio has added more
laurels to hi3 much laureled brow. The
last week of the Roberts' e/igagement will
be given over to an elaborate revival of
"Sapho."

Three of the theaters have repeat bills.
"Faust" and "Carmen" at the Tlvoii have
both proved themselves such attraclive
bills that they will both be repeated (lur
ing this week. It is quite likely that
"Carmen" will be heard again next week,
the business being simply enormous. The
casts of the two operas include all ths
stars of the starful company of the cur
rent season, and are indeed notable for
excellent balance. There are other fine
bills In preparation, one, "Nabucco," very
shortly to be given and a very rarely
heard opera that offers a splendid oppor
tunity to Salassa in the name part. "Pag

Lieutenant Price informed Furuseth
that the order would under no circum
stances be modified until the union men
altered their tactics. He said that the po
lice' were taking no sides in the . present
trouble, but that they were there to pre
vent violence and were going to do it. If
Furuseth. would prevent his men from at
tacking non-union men and visitors from
the country there would no longer bo
necessity for such stringent police precau
tions. The poiice were acting under or
ders. The union men knew what those
orders were, and if they suffered as the
result of those orders being carried out
it was their own fault. .
Andrew Furuseth, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the City Front Fed
eration, called on J-Jeutenant of Police
Price last night and requested that the
patrolmen on duty on the water front be
instructed to give the strikers more lib
erty of action than has been accorded
them of late: The orders given to the of
ficers and by them carried out as thor
oughly as possible are to prevent any
gatherings of men along the line of docks.
Lieutenant Price impressed this order
particularly on the officers stationed at
those points along the front where sailors
from ships in the stream are accustomed
to land. A number of the latter have
been -roughly handled of late, but since
the order to disperse crowds and keep
loafers moving has been in effect there
has been a marked decrease in the at
tacks.

MILWAUKEE, Sept, 15.â Over 100 men
Who bolted the meeting of the Bayview
Amalgamated Lodge a week ago met to
day and decided to apply for -work to
morrow at the plant of the Illinois Steel
Company. ;
There is much disappointment and an
ger among McKeesport strikers. The
leaders refused to credit the published re
ports until late to-night, but practically
admit now that all Is lost for McKeesport.
They blame President Shaffer for not no
tifying them to-day, according to promise,
and still look for official notification to
night. It is not believed that resumption
will be attempted until after President
Mclvinley's funeral. Amalgamated men
say they will not go to work till Shaffer
orders them. â¢
The threat is openly made that the tin
plate workers will withdraw from the
Amalgamated Association and form a sep
arate union of their own. - .
What the outcome generally will be can
not be told for a day or two. All of thÂ»
plants that have been idle-, are apparently
ready for an early start. Most of them
can resume to-morrow if their men report
for work. â¢â¢â¢ ' .-
What is considered the real conditions
of the settlement, though not officially an
nounced, are that the | settlement, was
made only for three companies in dispute
âthe American- Tin Plate, the American
Sheet Steel and the American Steel Hoop
âand those companies are allowed to re
tain as non-union all mills started in any
kind of shape since the strike order went
into effect. " The mills that were com
pletelyâtied up by the strike are to re
main under the Amalgamated scale.
Nothing was said concerning the National
Tube, the Federal or National Steel com-,
panies. The. settlement means a. big loss
to the Amalgamated Association, but
leaves it still a strong organization.
It seems impossible to-night to make an
estimate of the number of men who will
return to work to-morrow. Â¦ .
The members of the advisory board said
to-nlght.that the order calling the strike
off has gone out and that the men gen
erally will return to work to-morrow or
within c. day or two.

The public services in connection with

next month, will conclude with a great
missionary mass meeting, which is to be
held in the Mechanics' Pavilion on Tues
day evening. October 10. All the choirs,

churches will take part.
Right Reverend Henry B. TVhlpple,
Bishop of Minnesota, is announced to pre
side, while the Bishop of New York.
Bishop Hare of Niobrara, Bishop Edsal of
North Dakota and other missionary
Bishops are to speak. *
The occasion will be notable, not only
on account of the eminence of the speak
ers but as a musical festival of a high
order. Walter L. Sabin of St. Luke's and
\%. H. Holt of Grace will have the pro
gramme In charge. The following choirs
have accepted the invitation to assist: .

There Itelng no organ in the Pavilion
the orchestral band of the Third Artillery,
increased to fifty pieces, now stationed at
the Presidio, has been engaged to lead.
Instructions have been received to
make this service exceedingly "plain" and
have even specified the hymns that are
to be sung, the design being to avoid
even the suggestion of a display. The
service will be dignified and extremely
simple, the only reason for holding it in
a public building being the absence of
any other inclosure of sufficient capacity
to contain all the church people who will
attend.
The choirs will be vested and there will
be a processional and recessional. The
hymns are all of the simplest and most
familiar. There will be but two anthems.
"The Lord is Great." by W. T. Best. an<l
"Praise Ye the Father," by Gounod.
About 400 voices will be boys from the
male choirs. The music, with such a
body of singers, will be most Inspiring.
The committee having this special ser
vice in charge consists of Rev. R. C.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 15.â One of the first
"passenger train accidents to occur on the
White Pass and Yukon Railway since the
opening of the road happened September
Iff. -The accident wasat the we^f end
of the tunnel on the White Pass, about
two miles north of Glacier. That no lives
were lost was due to the quick action of
Engineer Mclvenzie.
The train left White Horse at 9 o'clock
a. in. with five 'passenger, coaches filled
and two baggage cars. Everything ran
smoothly to the summit and the heavy
train started on ths down grade. ThÂ« tun
nel was entered and the engine, two bag
gage cars and four coaches . had safely
passed over the high trestle just west of
the tunnel and. over the canyon 300 feet
deep when the forward trucks of the last
coach jumped the track. The rear trucks
stayed on the track.' *'< â¢
The last coach, with, the wheels of the
forward trucks bumping along; thÂ« tiess,
just reached.the opposite side when over
tipped "the coach, hanging on the end ct
the hill, with s. 500-foot chasm beneath.
â¢Engineer McKenzie applied. tile air brakes
and the train came to a sudden stop. Ten*
feet more and one of the most awful ac
cidents In ' Alaskan history* would have
been chronicled." "Â¦'Â¦'.
- The passengers in the overturned car
made a-ruab'tor the doors. The car was
in such a position that egress was hard.
The women made outcries, bat soon
gained their presence of mind and the
men forgot their own peril for the mo
ment and began assisting the women and
children to a safe position. By this time
every -member of the train crew was on
hand and with the passengers from other
parts of the train assisted the occupants
of the derailed car from their perilous
position. In a. few minutes every one cf
the thirty-three passengers were out.. -

'LONDON,- Sept.; 15.â The strength and
.confidence of the Stock ' Exchange j which
experienced such a severe shock when the
news uqf the attack upon President Mc-
Kinley was Â¦ received, suffered an* almost
equal 1 strartf~yesterday upon the sudden
announcement â¢ of : -. his death'.'- After a
momentary tremor and the , sagging in-'
evi table on the first announcement of the
shooting,' the market -"had rallied deter-'
minedly, supported here by immense buy -
ing orders, believed '. to be chiefly Ameri
can. The course of. trading throughout
was well, marked by -a healthy upward
trend, which was helped- greatly by; the
conlident : reports as to Mr. . McKinley'a
convalescence. :Â¦"; . .'-Â¦Â¦' ;
. With the- second Â¦ shock, . .lOwever, Â¦ the
whole courser of' the inside support, power
ful but secret, which had been holding up
the market, v must; be gone over again In
order to prevent a severe decline,; which
the big -.interests would not warrant at
this jmteture. One thing is certain, the
deattr^of Mr. McKiniey will . precipitate
gold â¢ shipments, owing to the desire of
New Yorkers to strengthen their position.
The Bank of England, following numer
ous Inquiries for eagles, raised the selling
prices to 76s 9d, but In case there should
be a determination on the part of the
United States to import gold the advance
of a farthing will not keep it here. Con
sequentlyy discount rates are hardening 1
materially, 2% per cent being asked on
three mtmths.' bills, and 2 per cent for
longer periods. Even at these rates the
holders of bills hesitated in the hope of a
further rise> Â»" .- <;'ji
Of course* a decided ri3e in money here
would tend to depress. hipÂ»* class securi
ties, but," .fortunately,. London, Parts and
Berlin are all well supplied.- It is not
thought that the Â£10,000,000 that will prob
ably be demanded by New York will,
create a serious stringency here. To those
able to ignore a high money rate, the
prospective shading of gilt-edged securi
ties should offer a good opportunity : In
the way of bargain purchases. Â»
While railway securities and industrials
are hesitating over the interest outlook,
mining shares are decidedly more eheer
ful, especially on the strength of better
news- from 'South Africa and the ap
proaching date of the 'effectiveness of
Lord"' Kitchener's proclamation." These
considerations favorably affect South
African mining shares, which also feel
the influence of the steadily increasing
output of the Rand. . :
BERLIN,. Sept.- 15.â The announcement
of the death of Mr. McKinley did not ex
ercise any depressing influence upon the
German Boerses,' It being believed that
Mr. -Roosevelt will pursue the same policy
as his predecessor and also that the
efforts of New York financiers to prevent
a crash would succeed. Canadian Pacific'
and Northern Pacific shares fell some
what Friday, but this was partly recov
ered Saturday. The Berlin Boerse, how
ever, suffered independents of the death
of Mr. McKinley from a variety of un
toward events. The week began with ths
announcement that .the Allgemeine Kleln
bahn Gesellschaf t would lose half its
capital . through recsnt financial troubles.

Several youngsters created a sensation
on Market street' yesterday afternoon .by
racing dogs that they . had *â¢ harnessed ; to
small wagons. The youths, -'/who . : had
American flags and'buntlng. attachedvto
the vehicles, hit -upon a j, racing' project
that caused several thousand" people -to
halt on Market street and 'watch the, re
sults. The ingenious youngsters had edu
cated their dogs, j One of them led one of
the animals half way ' from Third street
to Fourth and. then the racers were. given
their freedom.- The desire o.f the canines
to overtake the lone and . forlorn ; dog led
to the races, which attracted an immense
crowd. They; stopped traffic! and /caused
so much gambling- that the police 'ordered
them to "go way back and pit down." â¢ .

evidence its . worth as a -great dramatic
production. He' furthermore invited; the
opinion of other leaders in, the theatrical

Intention to continue the play â¢ here for

Wharf Ripped Open.
Salt Sacks" Piled on > Hathaways
Owners of freight and other destructible
property along - the water front are re
doubling the vigilance â¢ of : their watch
against vandalism. The police and watch
men stationed at the open docks and
wharves were yesterday notified to be on
the lookout for a gang of strikers who
were going up and down the water front
on mischief bent. : ."
. The watch from Meiggs wharf to the
mail dock is pretty thorough, but in spite
of all the vigilance these vandals man
aged yesterday to rip open, a large, num
ber of sacks containing salt. These sacks
are piled on Hathaways wharf, which is
open. Advantage was evidently taken of
the temporary absence of the watchman.
The actual damage done was not very
great, but the fact that the spirit of de
struction is manifesting itself is giving
those owning ; and * responsible for prop
erty along the wharves considerable Anx
iety. The memory of the destruction
wrought during the strike of seven years
ago is still fresh in the minds of the ship
ping men in this port. The acts of vandal
ism of yesterday have put them on the
alert,? and .future - attempts of the kind
will be accompanied by considerable risk
to the man or. men making the attempt..
â The speaker,' on being ' asked by one of
the committee" if the men would not re
turn to - work ! immediately if they were
assured, that they would be accordedpro
tectlon' against personal violence,, replied
that they were in no danger of being in
jured. He, .quoted Captain Dunleavy to
prove thaUnever before in, the history of
the water front has there been less crimi
nal dlsturbence. - Furuseth added that- he
only wished that the militia might be or
dered â¢out,' as then It would be uncontro
vertably proved to the Employers'. Asso
ciation that the men- were- not deterred
from , returning to work - because of any
fear of violence, but that they were hold-
Ing out for the principle of unionism.
. The strikers don't require : much assistance.
If "the worst comes to the worst they can live
on a -plate of mush in , the morning , and .a
plate of; stew at night. Â¦ I myself - have" lived
on that diet and worked, and I am certain
that , men - who are not working can do the
same, and not suffer. . â¢ :. â¢ â¢
" If the labor unions had assumed' the position
which the Employers' Association has assumed
In this fight they would Â¦ not be tolerated for
an instant. â¢ We tried to settle the controversy
before the strike was Â¦ declared and we Â¦ stand
ready to settle to-day. There Is some one . re
sponsible for the fact that property In \th4s
city is depreciating in value .and that ". Los
Angeles, is making inroads': into our com
merce. The "Board of Supervisors 'Â¦â¢ and the
Governor seem to think that it is Â¦ the Em
ployers*'Association. Â¦ .. Â¦â¢' Â¦ ' - Â¦"
Of course the fact remains that the laboring
men must have food, and of course if the Em
ployers' Association only holds cut long enough
the men will be starved Into submission. It
may take six months and it may take three
months. I -cannot tell how long: it will last.
In a great' measure, the ability of the local
unions to hold out depends . on the liberality
with -which the people In the East and in
California. render, -us financial assistance. ,The
steel strike in the East is now at an end and
consequently money will be freer and the labor-
Ing men in the East will be more able to. help
the local strikers.
The strike leaders for .the most part
rested during the day. : Pickets, however,
kept "a close watch upon the malcontents
who are talking in favor of giving up the
struggle. -._â¢ â¢ â¢ .;-. \ ; - . ;
Owing to the fact that there was no
quorum present the committee of one
hundred of the Municipal Federation of
Improvement Clubs appointed for the pur
pose of devising a - means of bringing
about a . settlement of the strike took no
definite action at the meeting held in the
afternoon. Andrew" Furuseth "of the City
Front "Federation was present at the
meeting and entertained the members of
the committee with a description of tha
conditions existing ; and also an explana
tion '.of . the. terms .on which the unions
were willing to return to work. Secretary
Furuseth said in part: :. V
Neither party to the labor controversy
was much concerned with plans yester
day. The employers remained away from
the offices from which their campaign is
carried out. Even along the water "front
little activity was displayed, as the neces
sity for extraordinary effort has passed.:

The members of the committee left last
night for their homes in the interior and
each one will endeavor to . secure such in
formation as will lead to a definite plan of
action by the convention.
Furuseth listened to the committee and
ran over at length the alleged grievances
that the laboring class suffer. He told the
visitors that there, was nothing but the
recognition of the unions that would sub
serve the purposes of the strike leaders.
Later, by appointment/Frank J.
Symmes of the Employers* 'Association
was met by the committee at the Pacific-"
Union Club. Again the whole subject of
the controversy was gone over, this time
from the employers' standpoint.-. ' Â¦:
A convention of farmers will be held in
Sacramento on September 25 to discuss the
situation. While this convention is called?
ostensibly to form a co-operative plan to
market grain, the discussions are likely
to take a wide range, -and unless the strike
is ended by that date the dispositions of
the farmers are such that no further de
lay in the shipment" of grain will be, tol
erated. : :,,.Â¦. v,.
As a final source of power the Governor
of the State was to be asked to carry out
the plain Intent of the law, the guarantee
of protection which the State constitution
provides to all persons. This was consid
ered to be the last and most unwelcome
resort, but the convention decided that
if' all other means failed 'there was but
this resource ; leftâ for each man to see
that his property was protected as far as
in his power Jay the ability.
Andrew Furuseth, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the City, Front Fed
eration, was the first one visited. - The
committee explained the unfortunate con
ditions that confronted the grain growers
of the State and endeavored to obtain an
idea of the reasons which actuated the
strike. *
When the convention at Sacramento met
and discussed the? injury done to grain
raisers throughout the State by the stand
taken by the leaders of the strike, this
committee, was charged with three impor
tant duties.' The first was to sea the op-,
posing factions and learn wherein a plan
off conciliation might be used to , end the
struggle, disastrous alike to striker, mer
chant and farmer. The Sheriff of Contra
Costa was then to be called upon and from
him ascertained what powers he could ex
ercise in the premise's.
; In accordance with a resolution adopted
at the meeting of the. farmers of Califor
nia'held In Sacramento on; Thursday .af
ternoon, a committee, consisting of James
Craig of Woodland, "William Beckman of
Sacramento and John H. Rice 'of Dixon,
came to the city yesterday and Inter
viewed the leaders of the. City Front Fed
eration and Frank' J. Symmes of. the Em
ployers' Association. '- Â¦*â¢Â¦Â¦. j-
Marrick was 70 years of age and the
father of nine children, six of whom are
still- living. .He retired from the Methodist
ministry twenty years ago. Â¦ - . Â¦ .-Â¦
The police worked oh the case for sev
eral hours in an effort to learn if an ac
cident in which- four were believed to
have perished had occurred. At a late
hour last night the identification of the
body recovered was established. The re
mains were found to be those of Marrick.
whose son called at the Morgue arid
viewed them. There is no possibility that
the aged clerk had any companions, and
the other three bodies are thought to have
existed simply in the imagination of Ber
dahl and Peterson.
Two Morgue wagons in charge of Depu
ties Flynn and Donahue were sent to the
Cliff House and the life-saving crew from
the Golden Gate Park station worked its
way around Lands End. The deputies
and the life savers could find but one
.body. The head was wedged between two
jagged rocks. The body was nude except
for a shirt. The other three bodies alleged
t ohave been seen by Berdahl and Peter
son were not in sight. The identity of
the single victim was not known at that
time, and it was thought that a mystery
had yet to be unraveled and that the sea
still held three of its dead.
About 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Frank Berdahl of 16S7 Folsom street and
Charles Peterson of 5^ Sumner street
rushed to the Cliff House and said they
had seen four corpses floating among the
rocks at -Lands End. Two of the bodies,
they said, were of women; the others of
men. The informers were taking pictures
at the time they made their alleged dis
covery, and claimed that they could not
be mistaken as to the number of dead.
Both averred that they had stood for
some time watching the bodies pitch and
toss in the surf before they hastened
away to inform the officials..- .Â¦'-
Richard Marrick, an aged ex-Methodist
minister, who /was* employed as a clerk in
the Methodist Book Concern, at 1037 Mar
ket street, committed suicide Saturday by
drowning himsslf near Lands .End. He
had received notice that his services
would be no jonger required by his em
ployers after the first day of next month,
and the fear of starvation for himself and
family .drove him to despondency. The
recovery of the body from where it had
been tossed by the sea was followed by an
investigation on the part of both police
and Morgue authorities, it being believed
that Marrick was but one of a party of
four that had perished in the sea. . 1
