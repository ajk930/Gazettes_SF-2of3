, "There is a suspicion In my -mind that
Doneghy was connected with Mamlock In
the fraud engineered by the latter. The
three womenâ Howie, Smith and Wilcoxâ
Barnes as fakers -and frauds, then took
the stand and swore that a newspaper re
porter had impersonated a detective of
ficer, when as a matter of fact Weinberg
may have been. the dupes of Mamlock and
I will give them. the benefit of the doubt.
The evidence is positive that Miss Mc-
Donald did make false "pretenses in sell
ing the ticket to 'the'complaining witness.
That, might -be, -the- basis -for another
charge. This complaint charges the va
rious defendants with. Conspiracy, .to ob
tain moneV by false pretenses. In dis
missing all the defendants, I wish to state
that I do not approve of the methods em
ploye.d by Doneghy arid his associates.' It
is a good thing that these .cases have
been brought, so that the public may
know fully what is going on. I have no
doubt whatever-that the public has been
deceived in making contributions, believ
ing that- the money was for the entire
use of the charities mentioned. I trust
that such methods .will "be stopped in the
future by the publicity given in this case,
The defendants are dismissed."
It" is probable that the' action of The
Call in showing up. the methods of these
charity swindlers will at least result In
putting the" public " on its guard arid pre
vent charitably Inclined citizens from be
ing again imposed on by them.
Defendants Are Dismissed.
Judge Fritz, in giving his decision dis
missing the, defendants, said: .
Assistant District Attorney Hanley ad
mitted that Mamlock was the prime mov
er in the fake concert schemes and that
his disappearance prevented the Introduc
tion of certain testimony which might
connect Doneghy and his workers in the
palpable frauds. ..... - : .. .
Detective Hamill told of Investigating
the schemes of Mamlock and the Done
ghy-Barnes-Deiweiller combination " and
how his Investigations showed, that Mam
lock's concert scheme - was an absolute
fraud, and that Doneghy and Mamlock
were closely connected.
asked the reporter to pose as an officer
and search the room of Helen Barnes for
evidence, the request of. Weinberg being
naturally refused.

day that Doneghy was "a grafter and a
fraud," and that he was assisted by Helen
Barnes in duping the public, tried on the

ThÂ«> first witness called was Charles A.
Sm!th. the cashier of the Columbian
Banking Company, who had purchased
one of the tickets for the concert In aid
of "The California Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society," a bogus creation of the mind of
Harry Mamlock. who had succeeded in
eluding the police.
The witness, who In a public spirit came
to the front to swear to a complaint
against the allpged conspirators, told how
he had been deceived into buying a ticket,
believing the concert was in aid of the
local organization known as the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society.
The evidence of two newspaper report

the air was filled with powder smoke and
the music of the bands marching through
the gate with the remainder of the brig
ade. The three companies claim they cap
tured the camp. The home command say
if -the call to arms had been sounded, as
it could have been, when the brigade was
first known to be advancing, no battalion
could have left the main column unob
served, and so every one is. happy. :
The Second/ Brigade camped last night
at Capitola. and on the way there It had
an adventure. Some time after the .brig
ade had left camp .Lieutenant Colonel
Hosmer, division Inspector; Major Hewes,

started after It to intercept it on the road.
They followed along until near Capitola.
Cutting across country, whenever possible
and finally choosing â¢ a .suitable place to
attack the advanc* guard, they waited for
the brigade. â¢â¢ It was in^a. narrow canyon,
as good -a place as -a small party could
have chosen, and Â¦when the advance guard
of Warfield's column: appeared the cavalry
attacked with revolvers. There was some
lively firing and , the advance guard fell

left the main body and approached the
camp from a different direction and some
distance ahead of the main column. They
came up the ravine In single file, and as
General WarfieJd was "being, received at
the guard tent with all the honors due a
friendly; command the attacking compa
nies sprang out of "the brush and made
a rush for the color line at division head
quarters. -
Then commenced the firing of rifles and
revolvers and a great shouting by the in
truders. It began to dawn on the camp
that the newcomers were not friends, but
enemies. There was a great rallying of
men of the Sixth and the Second regi
ments. They advanced on the timber line,
and. only too glad to have an excuse to
Bent for and a court was established In
the division commissary's tent.
The purpose is to examine every one of
the men and find if possible the ringlead
ers of the crowd that made the trouble.
The Investigation is still in progress, and
in the meantime the two men over -whom
the row was started are held to await
judgment, both civil and military. Noth
ing definite has come from the investiga
tion so far. for no one In particular was
leading the mob, and the gathering of
evidence of value 13 no easy matter.
General Warfleld's brigade marched
back to camp this afternoon, tired and
dirty, but proud of the fact that three
companies slipped past the guard and
came in the back way. or up the, ridge
through the timber skirting the camp
from the northwest. There was no effort
made to keep off the brigade on its .rfe
turn, as was done In the case of the First
Brigade on Its return, and to this is prob
ably due the fact that the three compa
nies slipped by the inner guards. The
' brigade had not reached Santa Cruz when
the signal corps announced Its approach.
General Dlckin&on was away with his
staff, and his aid. Major Hewes, after
consulting with-Colonel Berry of the Sev
enth Infantry, who happened to be at di
vision headquarters when the news came,
decided to treat the brigade as a friendly
command. No call to arms was sounded
and no cossack posts were sent out to re
connoiter. The approaching brigade had
therefore to deal only with the regular
guard of. the camp. v

SEATTLE. June 20.â A demand has been
made by the Seattle Building Trades
Council upon the lumber manufacturers
and wood-working shops of Seattle for a
reduction of the hours of labor to nine
hours a day without a : decrease of pay.
This demand grew out of the action of
the Seattle Lumber Exchange In declar
: Ing a boycott on the 'members of the
5 trades council as a means of retaliating
for the action cf the council in boycotting
the lumber manufacturers by the Morans.
Falling in their efforts to enforce their
'demands, the trades- council will proba
bly order all of the local mill operatives
out. This will result in a shutdown*of all
. the mills, and as the lumber mills
throughout the State of Washington will
in all probability support the' local mills
in their fight, even to the extent of re
fupJng to furnish lumber to Seattle con
tractors affiliated with the Building
Trades Council, this will cause building
operations in the city to practically cease,
throwing some 5000 men engaged in build
Â¦ Ing operations and 1000 men employed in
sawmills and other wood-working shops
in the city out of work.
The mill men are strongly organized and
propose to fight a battle to the bitter end,
even if it Involves a shutdown of indefi
nite length. They say that as the larger
proportion of their product is for export
and comes directly into competition with
the product of other mills throughout this
State and Oregon this i3 the only course
left them.

Defense in the Murphy
Case Asks for Non- -
Suit.
SAX JOSE, June 2O.-M!ss Bertha Smal
lej\ tvho is seeking to recover $24,000 from
the estate of the late James T. Murphy
for services rendered as an attendant and
nurse on the capitalist, rested her ca.se 1
to-day. For almost .three days witnesses
have been testifying to the relations
which existed between Murchy and the
,"Â»oman. When her last witness testified
to-day Miss Smalley appeared cheerful,
and assumed the jaunty air of a prospec
tive victor.
The defense introduced no testimony to
day, but Attorney Dflmas made a mo
don for a nonsuit, basing it on the ground
that if the services had been performed as
nurse the charge of $24,003 was far too
high.
Thomas C. Bethe'.l of this city, and an
intimate friend of Murphy, added a new
phase to the case. ' He had accompanied
Murphy on a trip to Europe several
months before his death and the latter had
often unbosomed himse'f of his love af
fair* to BetheJl. Murphy had told Bethell
after the will now being probated had
been witnessed that he would fool his rel
atives. He said the will he referred to
Â¦was not the only one. but that he had
made a later one. which was safely i
stowed away in San Francisco. It made <
Â¦provision, he said, "for the little girl who :
has been so faithful to me." Murphy fre
quently told Bethell how kind Miss Smal
3ey had been to him, and that he Intended .
to provide well for her. The deceased had
spoken of giving Miss Smalley a large
sum of money and buying her a country
home rear San Jose.
The deposition of E. J. Baldwin of San
Francisco was read. "Lucky" Baldwin
Is said to be a relative of Miss Smalley.
While conducting the hotel in 1S94-95 Bald
win said Murphy occupied rooms, and
after a time Miss Smalley came to live
with him. As soon as he found out the
relations of the two he ordered them out
of the hote'.. About a month after, when
he was in the barroom of the hotel. Mur
phy came to him and in an apologizing
.way tcld Baldwin he did not want him to
think he "had it In for him." Murphy
raid he was with Miss Smalley. and that
she had looked after him when he was
Intoxicated and that he was going to do
what was right with her.
The. Jury was excused for the afternoon
and argument In regard to the motion for
a nonsuit was opened by Attorney Kow
altky for the plaintiff. The case will go
on to-day. -Â¦Â¦Â¦

PITHEShot While Charging at Head of the
Irish Brigade at Battle of
Fredericksbtirg.
NEW YORK, June 20.â General Robert
Nugent died at his home in Brooklyn late
to-night as a result, of a bullet wound in
the stomach received at the battle' of
Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862, while
he was charging at the head of the
Meagher Irish Brigade. This wound has
troubled General Nugent ever since.
General Nugent was born in ; Ireland
July 24, 1824, and emigrated to New York
when a young man. He was lieutenant
colonel of the Sixty-ninth Regiment, New
York State Militia, before the opening of
the civil > war. At the opening of the war
he was' appointed a captain in the regular
army.. Shortly before the battle of Fred
ricksburg General Meagher was Incapaci
tated and Colonel Nugent succeeded to
the command and was brevetted. He was

FOLSOM, June 20.â The. big rock crush
er at the Folsom prison was burned to
the ground this afternoon. As ; the gen

fire was sent in from a post situated near
the rock crusher. Ten minutes after .the
alarm was sounded the massive structure
was enveloped in flames. A few trusted
convicts were taken from their cells and
were sent to try to save the building, but
they could not approach the place because
of the heat.
The rock crusher had supplied all por
tions of this State with crushed rock and
was capable of handling about forty cars
a day. The origin of the fire is not known.
The crusher was not in operation to-day,
and it is believed by some that the fire
was started by an incendiary. The de
struction of the plant will throw about 250
convicts out of work. The cost of the
rock crusher was $70,000. . â¢ ',
About 7:30 o'clock to-night the remains

Captain Henry M. Manney took the big
battleship Massachusetts through the
Narrows to-day. It was the first time in
the history of the navy that any com

dared attempt the feat, and river craft and
the shores were crowded- by spectators to
Â¦witness the trip of the Massachusetts.
The passing of the mammoth fighting

of hostilities with a foreign power a bat

Secretary of the Treasury, the acting j\.t-"
torney General and the Secretary of the
Interior, the Government's interest in the
Sioux City and Pacific Railway Company
was Fold at auction to-day, to the' Chicago
and Nothwestern' Railway ; Company for
$2,112,000, this being the upsetsprice fixed
by the Government and including a credit
of $250,000 due the company for mail
transportation, etc. The larger amount
was paid in caÂ«h. .
Some time ago the commission appoint
ed to estimate the value of. the road fixed
the amount at |3.500,000. Of this total
there were prior liens amounting to %\,
62S,000, which would leave the value of
the Government's claim $l,S72,000, which
with the credit of $250,000 i makes the
amount realized to-day: The total amount
of the Government's claim, however, was
$1,628,320 in principal and $2,556,269 in in
terest, making a total of $4,184,589. Ac
cording to the value of the road as esti
mated by experts no amount greater than
the price brought to-day could bo real

that figure. The indebtedness grew out of

On Tuesday afternoon information was

coming this way from Campbellton. That
evening Sheriff Van of Kerr' County with
his posse on a special train arrived here

had been seen, but had escaped* Majt

trail about five miles from Cotulia this
morning and followed him where he had
cut several wire fences. Blood' stains
showed that Cortez's- horse was about
exhausted and unable to jump.
About 10 o'clock the pursuing party
found the little, brown mare that Cortez
had been riding-. She was badly fagged.
Cortez's trail then led into a dense thick
et, covering hundreds of acres. No trail
was found leading from there, and he Is
supposed to be hiding In the thicket. A
large posse headed by Sheriff Avant ar
rived here this afternoon by train and '
left for the thicket. Strong 'hopes are
entertained for the speedy capture of Cor
tez. , The horse found is undoubtedly the
one ridden by Cortez, who came near Til
den, through the Dull. Irvin, O'Connor
and Johnson ranches, cutting fences as he
fled. - - /Â¦
The . posse was in sight of him once,
just before 8 o'clock, but he escaped. His
clothing is in tatters and he has thrown
away his rifle, retaining only his pistols.

nishings. - ,718 Market Street. hats.CHICAGO, June 2O.^It is generally re
ported to-night that Lady Schorr, one of'
the -most prominent, candidates for the
American. Derby and the only filly en
tered in the race for years given a chance
by the professionals, broke down to-day
in a trial at Hawthorne. The filly wag
known to be many pounds better than
Silverdale, winner of the St. Louis Derby
last Saturday, . and which was to have
been her stable companion in the big race
as the representatives of the Memphis
brewer, John F. Schorr. After working
the Derby route to-day in phenomenally
fast time,- 2:35%, Lady Schorr pulled up
lame and doubtless will 'be an absentee
from the post on Saturday. . .
_ Great secrecy is maintained around the
Schorr stables regarding the mishap to
the crack filly, and George Walker, the
trainer, disappeared immediately af tÂ«r
the filly went lame. The whole complexion
of the race is changed with the Esher
filly out of it, and thousands of dollars
bet on her in the winter books are lost.
His Eminence, the champion colt of the
West and winner of the Kentucky Derby,
covered the Derby course to-day with his
weight up in 2:35 flat, and the trainers ex
pect the horse that beats him to get the
money. â¢

Superintendent Fawcett Arranges At
tractive Boxing Programme at .
Reliance Club.
OAKLAND, June 20. â Superintendent
W. B. Fawcett of the Reliance Club has
arranged a programme for the monthly
boxing tournament which will take placa
Friday evening that has attracted more
than ordinary attention from the admir
ers of the ring sport. The chief event
will be a. return match between Georgo
Baker and Tom^Herman for five rounds.
Herman made a'" hard effort to get the
match, in -the hope of making a strong
showing against th>vlikely Baker, who
defeated him at their last meeting.-^
Jack Capeliss and Geo'rge* Cyjrrail are
on the card for a ten-round gw; and rheir
bout will Â¦ be' preceded by a - six-irrt>o,d
event between Louis Long ' and Georg"Â»
Murphy. The first event will be callecN
promptly at 8:30 o'clock. Under the new
rules members of the club will be com
pelled to exhibit membership cards. The
usual admission fee will be charged to
outsiders.
â¢ As usual, the Bay City Athletic Club did,
not live up to its promises last evening.
There were eight bouts scheduled, and of
this number but two of those advertised
td box put in an appearance, and much to
the disgust of the immense crowd that
filled the Mechanics* Pavilion Annex they
gave a fake exhibition. In a number of
instances Lieutenant Birdsall refused to
allow the boys to go for fear of a ring
fatality. The Bay City Club has been in
the habit of giving exhibitions of this
kind, : but deluded ring-goers continue to
buy the gold bricks. v 'â¢â¢-'Â¦.â¢
Tommy Dlxon, an untrained youth, was
put up against clever and hard-hitting:
Frank Neil. Jockey Bozeman was sched
uled to box Neil, but failed to materialize.
Dixon lasted three punches. There were
cries for Eddie Hanlon, the youth who
once took Neil's measure, and that lad
entered the ring, stripped for the fray.
Jim Nell ordered his son out of the ring
for fear he might lose to Hanlon.
"Jockey Bennett was scheduled to
fight Hanlon, but an untrained lad named
Burrows was substituted and Lieutenant
Birdsall refused to allow the lads to meet.
Henry Schilling proved a punching bag:
for Harry Foley. - Schilling was as game
as a pebble, but his seconds threw up the
towel when he was almost out in the
fourth.
Joe Angelo and Frank Pluso boxed four
fast rounds to a draw. \ .
Danny Danziger of the Olympic Club
narrowly escaped being knocked out by
Joe Howard." Danziger made the mistaka
of entering the contest, out of condition.
He was fat and had no force in his blows.
The Olympic Club boxer was far cleverer
than his rival and had things very mucn
his own way until the fourth round, when
Howard staggered him with a heavy
right on the jaw. Howard tried hard to
finish his man. but Danziger was game.
He clinched, took half the count and'then
managed to stay the limit. Howard was
justly given a decision.
Joe Nealon and Joe Murphy slapped
each other with open gloves, and the bout
was so â¢â¢brutal" that the club directors
and the police lieutenant stopped it in the
first round.
Tony Everett outclassed Jack McGinnU.
In the first round McGlnnis toed the
scratch chewing gum, and when knocked
down continued chewing. Everett made
him. swallow the gum in the third. Mc-
Oinnis stayed the limit, but was no match,
for his more youthful opponent. Everett
was awarded a decision.
Dave Barry and Ted Wolffe boxed four
rounds amid cries of "Fake!" and "Throw
them out!" - â¢

KIEL, June 20.â The Kiel regatta. opened
to-day Â¦with fair weather, and a light wind.
Emperor William's sloop yacht Samoa II
was fourth in the contest for the City of
Kiel cup. Twenty yachts took part in the
races. Among these were ' the French
yacht Arcachon, the English yacht Cia
and the Danish yacht Navanna. .
j Regatta week in Kiel will be more in
teresting than if was in 1900, because the
Emperor of Germany will also attend the
racing. Ninety-four vessels are now pres
ent at Kiel for the < regatta and-twenty
two sailing clubs are represented. ',
The arrival of Mrs. Robert Goelet on her
yacht Nahma created a sensation, as the
Goelets were wholly .unexpected at Kiel.
Much interest was manifested ' when Mrs.
Goelet entered, her small -boat, the Mishe
Nahma, for the Emperor â¢Â¦William prize
contest, notwithstanding the fact that ac
cording to the governing rules it was too
late for such an entry.

GLASGOW, June 20.â The Shamrock II's
new mast was stepped to-day. The new
spar consists of a hollow steel pole 160
feet : long, built in a single piece from
step to ' truck. It is the first spar of its
kind ever made. The advantage is
claimed for the new mast that it saves
top weight and also presents a smaller
wind surface. It permits of dispensing
with gear for hoisting and lowering of the
topmast, .and it is believed that a single
spar can be braced more rigidly than a
spliced telescopic mast. The chief disad
vantage of the single piece pole lies in the
impossibility, of housing, the topmast dur
ing heavy weather. In I this respect it is
pointed out that this maneuver has been
resorted to but once in the history of the
cup races.- Sir Thomas Lipton and- Mr.
Watson were present when the mast was
Stepped. - - . . - ;

Pennsylvania Oarsmen Out for Prac-
AMERICANS TAKE TRIAL SPIIT
'. WASHINGTON, June 20.â Justice Brad
ley in the Court to-day denied
the application of Lone Wolf and other
Indians for an injunction against the
Secretary o_f the Interior to restrain him
from opening the Kiowa, Comanche and
Apache lands in Oklahoma to settlement.
Without going into' the facts of the case
the court held that the question- was
purely a political one, with which the
court had no power to deal.
Counsel for the Indians Immediately
gave notice of a special appeal to the
District Court of Appeals.- Now that the
case is decided it is believed that the
President in about ten days will issue his
proclamation opening to settlement the
Kiowa, Comanche, Apache and Wichita
lands.
Judge Bradley held that if the act of
Juife 6, 1900, is violative of the treaty of
1868 the remedy rests with Congress, not
the judiciary- He said that the right of
the Indians to the reservation is a pos
sessory one only; that the wrong, if any,
threatened *by - the execution of the act
of June 6, 1900, is a wrong to the tribe as
a tribe, and that no individual member
will suffer any injury which will not be
shared in common by the other members.
The decision declares that the suit can
not, be maintained by members of the
tribe as individuals.
Justice Bradley further holds that the
Indians are the pupils or wards of the
nation; that the. duty of providing' for
their maintenance, civilization and educa
tion and of providing and caring for them
rests upon the Federal Government, and
is committed to its legislative or political
branch. Ho holds that the Â¦ question
whether three-fourths of the adult ; male
Indians signed the agreement, etc., was
presented to Congres; that the'ratifica
tion by Congress is necessarily a finding
that the agreement was assented to by
the requisite number of Indians, and that
there was ncf false or fraudulent repre
sentation or interpretation, and that this
decision by Congress is conclusive upon
the judicial tribunals. He further holds
that an act of Congress ana a treaty un
der the constitution of the United States
are upon an equal footing; that an act of
Congress will repeal a prior inconsistent
act of Congress; that the making and
enforcing of treaties are . under \ our con
stitution committed to the political branch
of the Government, and that the judicial
tribunals of the country are without
authority to enforce treaty stipulations
or to grant redress for wrongs inflicted
by their breach. â¢ . ' '. -.>;â¢

Cook at critical periods, especially In the
last two innings, when Yale seemed to
have fathomed his pitching and had two
men on bases. In the eighth, after two
men had scored, he struck out two others.
I The best and fiercest hitting of the day
was by" Frantz, the Harvard first-base
man, who banged out a triple, a home run
and a single; â¢-. Wendell also made three
hits, "one of which scored Clarkson. Score:

champions of the crimson around the four
bags, while about 1000 equally loyal ad
herents of Yale only succeeded in urging
three wearers of the blue across the home
plate. The seven runs were due primarily
to the ability of Ftantz, Stillman- and
Wendel to hit. but Cooke, the Yale
pitcher, puzzled nearly all the rest of the
crimson players. On the other hand,
Clarkson for Harvard was even more suc

Harvard Team Defeats
the Ball Players
of Yale.
MEN IN CRIMSON
WIN THE GAME
The local players sacrificed time and
again, and it was due to this clever work
that they scored many tallies. Umpire
Tyler made one unpopular decision. He
called a safe hit inside the third bagr a
foul and thereby cut off an Oakland run.
His decision was somewhat excusable, as
the umpire was standing behind . the
The, Athenians played a good fielding
game, but ran bases like a crowd of
school boys chased by a policeman. Many
Dudes were caught posing, and three or
four were riveted between bases. "Truck"
Eagan- was weak with the stick, but when
he tears loose he will surely shatter the
atmosphere. Francks and Drennan played
a good game. The short stop accepted
seven without a miss, and Drennan cap
tured a high one with a back hand reach.!
James Whalen, who Is lovingly" called
"Chimmy der Whale" by his youthful ad
mirers, forgot the "Charley-horse" in his
ankle and toed the slab for the local nine.
Jeems was given a jovial reception by
the fans and he modestly accepted the
plaudits, j Whalen's "gigs" were a trifle
off color, and he frequently missed the
rubber with his shoots. Nevertheless he
held the Beaux down to three hits up to
the seventh, and then slackened up, as
;hls:arm was a bit stiff after his long rest.
.Whaien's record for the game was seven
walks, one man hit by him. three strike
outs and five hits off his delivery.
It was a bad day for Mr. Babbitt, who
is known to the fans as "Rabbitt" Bab-,
bitt pitched a conscientious game for the'
Dudes, but the Dutch were onto his curves
and they pounded him for eleven safe
oÂ»es. "Â¦â¢

saw h!s Job In the balance and he

in earnest than his team mates, as he
opened up by hitting the housetops for a
run around the bases. He followed this
with a three . base bump . and closed an
honorable record with a two base crack.

NEW YORK, June 20.â The case of
Thomas C. Barker, charged with the
shooting of the Rev. John Keller at Ar
lington, N. J., last February, will go to
the" jury in Jersey City to-morrow about
JT o'clock. A verdict may be expected be
fore night.
Before court adjourned this evening the
evidence was all in, and nothing now re
mains but the arguments of counsel and
the Judge's charge. To-day Mr. Keller
was once more upon the stand. He
seemed to have been aroused for the time
being from the lethargic state which
marked his conduct and action when he
testified on direct examination. Then he
spoke in a low, tired voice. To-day his
denials of the allegations of Mr. and
Mrs. Barker were spoken in a loud. 'firm
tone, and when asked if the alleged out
rage was the reason for- Mrs. Barker
leaving the church he shouted out the
"no" so that it rang through- the court
room and corridors. His denials gener
ally were strong, positive and absolute.
When on the stand before Keller showed
no spirit, but to-day as he denied the
truth of the statements of the Barkers
he was more like the Keller -of a year
ago, his friends said, than he has been at
any time since the shooting.
It was a hard day for Mrs. Barker, for
neighbor after neighbor went on the stand
and swore that her reputation for truth
and veracity was bad.
The battle of the insanity experts was
the third feature of the day.

' Assessor Dodge officially Â¦Â¦ informed
Mayor, Phelah yesterday that the assess
ment roll so fav as completed would ag

This will insure the appropriations based
on an increase over $400,000,000 ln the tax
budget, which is now in the hands of the
Mayor. The" appropriations include $12,000
to pay interest on teachers' back claims.
$10,000, to repave Post street, $5000 for an
emergency hospital in the park and other
minor Â«items. '. . . -
Assessor Dodge says that the losses on
assessments aggregate $12,000,000, but they
,wlll be made up by adding ! newly dlcov
ered personal property. to the roll and by
increased valuation of real : estate in cer
tain favored business localities that have
shown marked advance In values during
the last year.-
The losses include $1,500,000 on church
exemption, $3,fÂ»00,000 in large estates that
have been distributed, $6,000,000 on old,
dwelllng-house3 upon which nothing has
been- allowed tor depreciation In twenty
years, $1,000,000 because of the Sunset Tel
ephone Company moving Â¦ its . office ' to
Martinez and transferring its tangible
property" to an Oregon corporation and
$350,000 lost by the California- Powder
Company moving to Contra Costa County.
An - assessment of $900,000 on the local
telephone ,' company I is doubtful,, as Â¦. it
claims that as; it is a foreign corporation
it should not pay a franchise tax, as other
quasi-public corporations do.
â¢ Additions to the roll comprise $3,000,000
on bonds which have heretofore escaped
taxaton.. One estate never taxed before
gives $30,000 to the city. Last year a sim
ilar item of $3,000,000 was discovered which
had been kept in the' probate office for
twelve years. The telephone corporation
and the powder company, are the only
two; that have moved, showing that all

" Publicity has been given to a rumor that
Senators Perkins and Bard have referred
the appointment of Collector of Internal
Revenue, First District, to the seven,Rep
resentatlves in Congress from ! California.
The rumor also says that (the Congress
men have declared in favor.' of retaining
John . C. Lynch ]as ; Collector. ; These
rumors are not founded on fact. â¢; The Sen
ators have made no such reference. Con
gressmen Frank Ii. Cdonibs of the First
and S. D. "Woods of the Second 'District
have not been apprised^ of such reference,
and have not entered Into any agreement
concerning affairs of, the Revenue Col
lector's office.' There has been no con
ference of the seven Representatives on
topics touching the distribution of Federal
patronage. According to the best in
formation attainable the members of Con
gress have not exchanged views, one with
another, on the subject of the Revenue
Collectorship. It is a fact, however, that
Senator Perkins did agree to recommend
for Lynch's successor any Republican of
good character and known capability
named by Senator Bard. The office was
practically tendered to Senator Rowell of
Fresno, but he declined " the proffered
honor. . Â¦ Â¦ 'â¢-Â¦â¢
Fresno County expects to be recognizes
by . the Republican party, but higher
recognition than that which an ordinary
Federal appointment would confer is sug
gested. Indications are that Fresno will
present the name of Frank H. Short for
Governor of California, The Stockton
Record and Fresno Mirror speak tot Mr.
Short's unquestioned ability and remark
that he is especially/deserving of consid
eration at the hands of the , Republican
party. .
At a meeting last night of the Primary
Election League of this city the following
petition was approved and forwarded to
the Board of Supervisors: â¢.-Â¦'Â¦
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco: The Re
publican Primary League, organized for the
purpose of enlisting the interest of all good
citizens in the maintenance of the primary elec
tion law and of securing a strong and sound
municipal government, I respectfully requests
your honorable, body, in accordance with the
provisions of the act of the Â¦ last Legislature,
to declare August 13, 1901, a holiday, that
being the day which by law Is fixed' for the
holding of the primary election this year, and
being generally observed in the business com
munity as "collection day."..
Your proclaiming this^ day a legal holiday
would enable all the merchants and their em
ployes and all laboring men better and more
easily to fulfill their duties and to enjoy their
rights as citizens In the Important matter of>
the primary elections, which will hereafter be
the fundamental basis of all good government.
We respectfully ask you to take action im
mediately in order that our citizens may, suf
ficiently far in advance, he guaranteed an op
portunity to vote at the primary election, so
that their interest may immediately be evoked
and impressed-, in the cause of good government

Here is a pretty problem in arithmetic 'to amuse
people who have leisure for calculations. 'An un
known donor lias presented Columbia College, New
York, with $100,000 to found a chair of the- Chinese
language, accompanying the gift with a letter say
ing: "For fifty years I have refrained from the use
of whisky or tobacco, and inclose j'6u a check which
represents the interest on my savings." The question
is to determine how much whisky and tobacco the
man would have had to consume to make the interest
on it amount to $100,000.
Mrs. Kendal says a woman who seeks success on
the stage needs "the face of a goddess, the strength
â¢ of a lion, the figure of a Venus, the voice of a dove,
the temper of an angel, the grace of a swan, the agil
ity of an antelope and the skin of a rhinoceros." The
list is excellent, but it will be noted that Sarah Bern
hardt has none of them. She has, however, two arts
that beat. them all â she knows how to act and she
knows how to keep heiself advertised. .

SPILLING SALTâ B. E. Berkeley, Cal.
Spilling salt was 'held by the Romans in
ancient time to be an unlucky omen. The
superstition has descended to the present
time. In Leonardo da Vincini's famous
picture of the Lord's Supper Judas Isca
riot is represented as spilling the salt. He
probably introduced that feature to em
body in his picture the popular supersti
tion. , Salt was used in sacrifice by the
Jews as well as by the Greeks and
Romans. It was an emblem of purity and
the sanctifying influence of a holy life on
others. Spilling the salt after it had been
used in a sacrifice was looked upon as a
bad omen. A ? ift of bread a'nd salt was
a token of friendship; -salt was also a
token of amity; so spilling a man's salt
may have been construed into a token of
enmity.

BLOOD FROM A TURNIP.
BY some ancient proverb-maker of our language
it was declared impossible to squeeze ,blood
from a turnip. ThaJ impossible thing . the
allies are now trying to do by demanding from China
various indemnities aggregating $315,000,600. â¢] The
Ministers of the nations are well aware that China
has not the money, and consequently that it cannot
be squeezed out of her as Germany squeezed five mil
liards from France, and, furthermore, they are aware
that as her bonds would be worthless she cannot bor
row the money. They have therefore set their wits
to work and arc trying to devise means to get the
spoil they have exacted.
The first scheme proposed was a simple one. Rus
sia; Germany and France joined in a suggestion that
the powers unite to guarantee the loan. In that way
it would be easy to sell the bonds, the various Gov
ernments would get their money at once fronvthc
stock market, and then if the Chinese did not pay
when the amounts became due the allied armies would
descend upon' China in battle array and there would
be further indemnities and another issue of' bonds
guaranteed by^ the powers.
The proposal was rejected by our Governmenton
the ground that the United States. could not consent
to guarantee the bonds of any foreign nation without
the consent xtl Congress. The British objected to > it Â¦
for reasons which have been explained to Parliament
by Lord Lansdowrie. In the first place, his Lordship
stated, the Ministry do not believe they. would be jus
tified in asking Parliament to pledge the credit of the
empire to facilitate the collection of vast indemnities
of which, the British empire would receive less than
one-ninth. In the second place,- Great Britain has
haÂ«l experience in making joint guarantees of debts
of Egypt and of Turkey, and the result has not in
clined the Ministry to enter upon new experiments
of the kind. Third, because the only. way in .which
the bonds could be redeemed would be by increasing
customs duties on Chinese importations; and as' the
great bulk of such imports are British the scheme'

GOVERNOR PINGREE.
WITH the death of Pingree passes from
American public life a picturesque and in
efficient figure. To call him Michigan's
greatest Governor is to do violence to the memory of
Lewis Cass and Governor Blair. .
He took his rise in politics in the period that
produced the " "industrial armies," with Generals
Coxej r , Kelly and Carl Browne.
There is no doubt that he felt keenly the distress of
the poor in the hard years 1893-96, but his remedies
were ephemeral and dealt with the .symptoms of pov
erty without going to its cause.
He vras a large manufacturer and fell into the habit
of lecturing other manufacturers upon \he proper
treatment of their emploj-es, but when his own struck
for better wages and better treatment it appeared that
even the most benevolent' intent may not be carried
into action. His vogue as Mayor of Detroit forced
him forward as a Republican candidate for Governor
in 1896. He felt no sense of loyalty to the Repub-
lican ticket, and it was with difficulty that straight
Republicans were restrained from voting for Rufus
Spragne, the Gold Democratic candidate, who would
have been elected but for the effect on the Republican
national ticket. Pingrce's views of public administra
tion were opposed by sound economists like Professor
Thompson of Michigan University, but were quite
agreeable to the Bryan wing of the Democracy, led
by a rich aristocrat of Detroit, Hon. Daniel Campau.
It seemed imminent more than once that the Democ
racy would take him up, but there was. the restraint
of old liners, led by Don M. Dickinson, who has
maintained a quite powerful personal following in
that State. Â¦
Governor Pingree's second administration was, un
fortunately, adumbrated by many scandals and much
crime among his appointees. The militia officers ap
pointed by him took advantage of the opportunity
for corruption offered by the Spanish war, and several
of them were arrested while fugitives from justice and
were sent to the penitentiary. Pingree pardoned them
at the close of his term, an act that did not add to his
good reputation in Michigan.' He was a man of poor
judgment in selecting appointees, and though person
ally honest himself, gave Michigan the most corrupt
administration in its history. Â¦'â¢%Â£%Â£

a liberal allowance was granted by him to the lady who con
tinued to bear his name.
Those who would speak a good word for the Duchess of
Avaray offer many excuses for her. In the first place. Rose do
Mercy-Argenteau was a beauty, and up to the day of her wed
ding had enjoyed only In part the luxuries she coveted, tho
jewels and fine raiment which she knew wotold enhance her
charm. Then her father, attributing all the unhapplness of his
life to a restrained youth, gave his favorite daughter unreined
freedom to go where and with whom she pleased. Thus Mile,
Rose de Mercy-Argenteau fell in, while she- was still a child,
with a set whose creed was extravagance In language, conduct
and dress. And further, any one familiar with the separate
Idiosyncracies of aristocratic families will tell you that nothing
more need be said than that the Duchess of Avaray has Car
men-Chimayblood in her veins. That her mother was a
Princess of Chimay seems to more than account for any reck
lessness on the part of her daughter.
Not long ago the Duchess, by the death of her parents
came into possession of their ancestral homo of Argenteau.
which was built early In the eighteenth century on the ruins
of an ancient castla overlooking the Meuse. near Liege Hera
she lives part of each year. Then she goes often to England
in the hunting season and takes her place among great ladles
of the turf as the Princess of Montglyn. a title which belonged
at one time to the Mercy-Argenteau family. Naturally her
sporting proclivities and her newly acquired chateau havo
necessitated an Increased income. A constant tight on her part
to Increase the income settled upon her In 1SS9 has resulted in
naught: therefore, as well founded report has it. the presern
suit of the Duchess of Avaray to get possession of her son "3

FRENCH DUCHESS WHO HAS THE REPUTATION OF
BEING THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT WOMAN IN PARIS
Splendor of Queens Could Not it One Time Rivaf That of the Divorced Wife
of the Duke of Avaray.
NO lady of the French aristocracy has set more tongues
a-wagging nor has appeared oftener in the courts than
the Duchess of Avaray. says the Chicago Times-Herald.
Several years ago It was her suit of divorce from the
Duke that let loose a number of truths about the high-flying
Duchess w^iich served to keep scandalmongers busy for many
a day. Just now these stories and many more are circulating
through the grande monde of Paris. For the Duchess of Ava
ray has again appealed to the courtsâ this time to obtain pos
session of her son, a boy of 16, who at the time of the divorce
was given into the care of his father: Those who know say it
is no v belated affection springing up In the heart of Mme la
Duchessâ she has been content for a decade or more that the
little Marquis of Avaray should be reared by his father
rather, say these, is it a new method of extorting money from
the man who was once her husoand. She is not content with
the liberal sum granted her with the divorce, for it takes
money to keep up with the set in which she is a conspicuous
figure ; vast amounts of it to earn and maintain the reputation
of being the most extravagant woman In Paris.
Reckless extravagance is the keynote of her character and
from , it springs all the good and bad fortune of the Duchess
of Avaray. The marriage of Rose de Mercy-Argenteau, a dow
erless bride, to one of the richest nobles in France soon proved
that. the best filled coffers could not- stand the demands of the
newly made Duchess. Soon It began to be whispered amonjr
tho Duke's friends that his patience was diminishing as fast
as his fortune. The splendor of the Queen of Sheba and the
Â¦Empress Eugenie combined could scarcely rival that of the
Duchess of Avaray. It is said, too. that $100,000 went into un
derwear alone in less, than eighteen months. So the divorce
cut short this heedless disposition of the Duke's money, though
wharf could not be built at Point Bontta '
and that the first storm would wash It
away If it was built.
Colonel Davis was permitted, however,
to carry out his plan, and the storms of
last winter had no effect upon the wharf
whatever., Last week the whole work was
completed and the wharf and tramway
are now being utilized in the landing and
hauling of material for a large boarding
house and other buildings for sheltering a
large force of workmen to be employed on
the new defense works.
JThe^ new wharf has a total length of
675 feet and ascends to a point
Fort Baker, as the new post Is called.
Is located on tho crest of the low eleva
tions of . the Coast Range, which here
meets the bay, and at a height of 300 feet
above mean low water. Approach
over tho steep hills of Marln County was
possible, but extremely impracticable
without constructing roads costing a
quarter of a million dollars.
Colonel C. E. L. B. Davis, ' who has
charge of the engineering works of the
Government at Point Bonita, decided upon
a wharf with a tramway, constructed on
the style of mountain roads, but his plan
was opposed on the ground that such a

PRESIDENTIAL SPECULATIONS.
k X- Â¦ : â Â¦ -.; .Â¦ ':>%::Â¦â¢% '.Â¦'Â¦Â¦
WHEN President McKinley announced that
he would not under any circumstances be a
. candidate for re-election the country was not
surprised, though there was of course a good deal
of gratification that the talk of a third term had been
so promptly ended. So far as the public is concerned
the incident was closed by the President's letter, and
there has been little further speculation on the sub
ject, for the people have other things to do than to
discuss the next Presidential contest so* far in advance.
It is different, however, in Washington. At the na
tional capital things are dull at this season of the
year, and as a consequence the Presidential succession
affords as good a subject for debating and predicting
as any other.
Shortly after the publication of the President's de
termination to retire at the end of this term there
came from Washington a report that Illinois men
are already grooming Senator Cullom for the race^
It is said that Senator Mason has announced the can
didacy of his colleague and will support him from
start to finish. Cullom is a venerable statesman who
was in politics before the war, and his friends say he
bears a striking resemblance to Lincoln. He is
rather old to be spoken of as a Presidential candi
date, but the Illinois men do not count that as an
obstacle; and, moreover, in Illinois there is* no
younger man around whom the boys would rally.
A few days ago Senator Allison went to Washing
ton and visited the President, and the political experts
of the city immediately began te figure out his
chances for the succession. The correspondent of the
New York Sun in-noting his arrival said: "In several
conventions of the Republican party the name of this
popular Hawkeye citizen and experienced legislator
has aroused enthusiasm and brought forth votes.
Oh more than one occasion, too, his name has been
well to the front on several ballots..* * * Of
course Governor Shaw, Speaker Henderson and
everybody else in the Hawkeye State will be for Mr.
Allison if it be deemed wise to present him to the
convention." ;
The Iowa man is not so old as Cullom, but still he
is not what would be called a boy orator, being 72
years old. The Sun man says: "No one would
guess him to be over 60, and he. looks much younger
than many men of that age now in public life. * ' * p *
He is no nearer being baldheaded than he was at
30, and his cheeks still retain the rosiness of youth."
Another Congressman who has made a summer trip
to Washington is Landis of Indiana, and his appear
ance at the capital has led to the suggestion of Fair
banks of Indiana for the Presidency. The correspon
dent of the Philadelphia Public Ledger says: "Mr.
Landis is a Fairbanks man and a politician of
acknowledged astuteness. He is said to have
sounded the President as far as was polite to-day on
his disposition toward" the different possible Presi
dential candidates. What the result was neither Mr.
Landis nor the Presidenthas yet divulged."
By way of describing Mr. Fairbanks the writer goes
on to say: "He is a cool, calculating man, and would
not be a candidate if he were not sure of some of his
premises. He has wealth and commands confidence
among public men in his ability as a lawyer and his
sagacity, as a statesman. He came up from severest
poverty, and for years after he began to study and
practice law did his own cooking and took care of
his room. He has made his wealth not only by his
law practice but by' shrewd investments and the habit
of . saving rather than spending. Representative
Landis says. that Republicans of Indiana will do for
Fairbanks what they never did for any other favorite
son â not excepting Morton or Harrison â they will
send a solid Republican delegation to the next na
tional convention for him."
It will be seen. from all this that the Washington
correspondents ; are, getting a good deal of space writ
ing out of the Presidential succession; Any man who
wishes to be" mentioned" for the Presidency has "only
to go to the capital before the heated term is over.
Â¦In the meantime the country at large is keeping quite
cool, knowing' full iwell that the choice of a President
is work for another year,: and not for this one.
â¢ From the way they are wriggling it would seem that
if the Democrats could only get rid of Bryan they
'would feel like celebrating the Glorious Fourth as
Thanksgiving day! -.

would virtually mean taxing British trade for the 'sake
of foreign Governments. ; ' :Â¦ Â¦
/Lansdownewent on to say the British Government
proposes that China shall pay no money : down' at all,
but shall, give to the_ powers concerned bonds repre
senting the share due to each of these powers, \which
bonds may be extinguished by payment of principal
and' interest. Obviously, if any power chose to guar
antee its own share of the bonds to purchasers, that
would be its own affair. For the service of the bonds,
to be issued by China" in the manner described Lo'rd
Lansdowne thought it should be possible to specify
certain sources of Chinese revenue, the yield of which
might be paid at frequent intervals to a board or coun
cil, whose-specific and sole business it would be to
receive the money and distribute it among the cred- /
itor powers. Such a board would' be merely a re
ceiving board, and would not be directly concerned in
the imposition or collection of Chinese taxes.-
There are of course serious objections to that plan.
The United States Â¦Government, has indicated a will
ingness to waive a money indemnity altogether and
to accept in place df it "increased commercial privi
leges." That proposal has led certain financiers' to
discuss the feasibility of financing the whole loan in
return for the. privilege of operating railroads and'
mines in China. -.< In these days of billion dollar syn
dicates it .would not be difficult to float a loan of the
amount of the Chinese indemnity if big trade privi
leges were back of it. â¢ v . r
Thus: the Governments and the financiers discuss
among themselves what shall be done to get out of
China what is not in China, and it must be admitted
that sometimes diplomatists have perplexing 1
problems. . ' â¢
SINCE the Â¦ limitation of .the 1 action of the Dart
mouth College .decision, and the separation of
quasi-public corporations organized for profit
from those that are for religious and educational pur
poses, the doctrine of municipal control of the former
has had a' steady growth. Such control has not al
ways been wisely 1 directed. It was in the beginning 1 ,
contested by, the corporations," which relied on the
doctrine of vested . rights as asserted in the Dart
mouth case. But this -form of contest between the
corporations and the people was ended by "the Su
preme .Court ; in Â¦ the 'so-called "Granger cases," in'
which Western railroads were involved. Since then
the principle of municipal control has developed
quite rapidly, and now has a .definite body of law
and well defined limitations. Such control must be
judicially exercised. Under the fourteenth amend
ment to the Federal . constitution the due process
of law has been clearly defined as the judicial process,
and life, liberty and property must have its benefit!
State railroad commissions must act judicially, and.
for that reason are now actually treated, as they will
soon be legally recognized, as courts of first instance.
Other public bodies' which fix rates for all kinds of
quasi-public corporations have assumed such func
tions judicially, greatly to the benefit of the public.
A decision by any of suchbodies is subject to the
same rules as if given by a court. ./There is a- recent
familiar instance of this in the Oakland water case.
The law of this State makes City Councils and Boards
of Supervisors the regulating and controlling author
ity in fixing water rates. . The habit of doing so
judicially has. not yet become fixed, and men -who
hold those positions* yield 1 to the temptation to get
votes and power by announcing in advance that Aey
will cinch the water company. Now this is the same
as if a Judge should announce in advance of a hear
ing his decision in a case that was to be tried before
him. Such prejudgment would of course vitiate his
decision.
Unaware of the judicial nature of their action and
of the dignity of the function they were about to ex
ercise, the members of the Council courted public
favor by announcing their hostility to the water
company and their intention to decide the rate ques
tion in a certain way. But they were dealing with a
litigable matter, and when it was litigated the un
pleasant fact was revealed that they had left the city
defenseless by their lack of judicial method. The
consequences are serious at present, but the projected
effect will "be good, since it puts all such public bodies
in this State on their caution, and warns them that if
their is to be really beneficial to the people
it must be in all respects judicial. Candidates for
those offices can no longer bid for votes by, pre
pledging themselves to do things which the courts
are sure for that reason to reverse, but which would
not be litigated at all if done judicially.
In the manner and benefit of public control of
quasi-public corporations, the State of Massachusetts
leads in this country. She comprehended and ac
cepted the judicial idea" of that function in the begin
ning. Her Railway Commission was made prac
tically a court of first instance, and thereby the
method was established for other public bodies
charged with the same functions. All of these bodies
have carefully worked out the general principle of
law that no corporation shall be permitted to do any
act that is of injury to the public. The Gas Commis
sion recommends consolidation and monopoly of the
electric lighting companies of Boston, but it also
forbids any watering of the stock of the combination,
and retains control of the rates. This establishment
of the principle that the State, the municipal 1 author
ity, may oversee the service rendered the public by a
corporation, and also forbid the issue of fictitious
securities in excess of the actual value of the prop
erty, is so salutary and sane that it deserves exami
nation, as a method in competition with municipal
paternalism.
If the country go forward on the Massachusetts
lines the trust problem will begin to reach a solution,
since the most offensive feature is the fictitious infla
tion of values by watering stock and over-issue of
securities. When the people have learned that cor
porate properties may increase in value and that the
only way to express that increase is by issuing more
stock, and that such operation is as legitimate as the
expression of increased land value by its rise in price,
but that increase of stock which represents no increase
in value is a fraud upon the public and a confidence
game upon the buyer of the inflated security, a long
step forward will have been taken to prove the su
periority of municipal control over municipal pater
nalism.

The fifth trial of Peter McGlade on the
charge of forgery is drawing to a close
before Judge Burnett and a jury in Judge
Cook's court. A number of witnesses were
examined yesterday, but nothing of a sen
sational nature developed. The defend
ant's wife was in court as usual and took
a seat beside him. , She seemed to take as

. J. J. Cathcart, . assistant bookkeeper In
the Street Superintendent's office at .the
time the defendant was bookkeeper, testi
fied that the signature in the forged Sul
livan demand | was - in the defendant's
handwriting. ; He was satisfied that part
of the, body of the demand was in the de
fendant's handwriting, but he was not so
sure about the other part. In answer to
a. question of the defendant's attorney he
said that it was his belief that the whole
of the demand ; was In McGlade's hand
writing. After considerable argument that
part of his testimony, was stricken out.
Theodore Kytka, the ( handwriting - ex
pert, testified that the handwriting and
signatureNin the Dwyer demand was in
the defendant's handwriting, and after ar
gument the demand was admitted as evi
dence. The District Attorney attempted
to get' the other demands alleged to be
forged admitted, but the Judge declined
to admit them without further authori
ties, and the matter was held in abeyance
until to-day. : Â¦'.:..
John J. Lyons, another assistant book

DRUIDS ELECT
NEW OFFICERS
I 1 NFORMATION was received in this
city yesterday that the Rev. Dr. S.
E>. Hutslnpiller. pastor of the Cen
tral Methodist Episcopal Church, lo
cated on Mission street, had been
unanimously elected president of the Ohio
University of .Athens. Ohio,
When seen last evening at his residence
Dr. Hunsinpiller stated that last Satur
day he had received a letter from General
Charles Grosvenor of Ohio asking him to
accept the presidency of the Ohio Col
lege.
"I -was not a candidate for the pesl
tlon," said Dr. Hutslnpiller, "and I at
once wired to General . Grosvenor re
questing that my name be not put for
ward as a candidate. The retiring presi
dent of the college also joined in asking
me to become Ms successor.
The Rev. Dr. Hutsinpiller was formerly
pastor of a church In Athens, Ohio, and
General Grosvenor and President Super
were members of his congregation. He
filled many pulpits In the State of Ohio,
and left a pastorate in Erie, Pa., to ac
cept the call to the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church In this city.
"To-day I received a telegram inform
ing me that the faculty, student body
and the people of Athens had decided
upon my selection as successor to Presi
dent Super, and the trustees of -the col
lege were unanimous In electing me.
It was not known for some time what
had happened, but a spectacular illumina
tion of the sky Indicated that some celes
tial body had struck the earth. The" paper
does not contain any definite Information
as to the size of the meteor. A party has
started from Altar to visit the spot where
it fell and information is expected.
In Tucson Charley Hoff and Herb
Drachman saw the meteor as It passed
toward the southwest. Although the sun
Â¦was high in the heavens the meteor Illu
minated the sky and left a trail of fire.
The place where it is supposed to have
fallen Is between the pueblos of Altar and
Las Molinas, or about 129 miles from
Tucson.
A report was given by prospectors who
just returned from Sonora that the me
teor covered an acre of ground and was
buried In ihe desert sands. These prospect-"
ore stated that they were crossing the
desert and saw the meteor coming. They
were eo terrified that they only stopped
to look back and see where it had fallen.
They hurried out of the country, fearing
that other meteors would fall In that
vicinity. A party will be organized in
Tucson to visit the spot where the meteor
fell.
TUCEOX. Ariz.. June 20.â An immense
meteor has fallen in Sonora. El Progreso,
& Spanish weekly paper, which was re
ceived to-day, says that the people of
Altar, where the paper is published, were
terrified on June 11 at 10 o'clock in the
morning by a shock as though an earth
quake had begun. Buildings were shaken
and a great report was heard. The peo
ple at Las Molinas also heard the report,
and settlements at a distance of fifteen
miles from the spot where the meteor lell
felt the thock.

It Is safe to say that the regular persistent
use of Stuart's Dyspepela Tablets at meal time
will cure any form of stomach trouble except
cancer of the stomach.
Full sized . packagV of these tablets sold by
druggists at SO cents. Little book on stomach
troubles mailed free. Address F. A. Stuart Co.,
Marshall. Mich. _Â« ;..
This can be done by the regular uso after
meals of some safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive preparation, like Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, which, may be found at most drug
stores, and which' contains valuable, harmless
digestive elements In a pleasant, convenient
form.
The most sensible treatment for heart trou-
ble Is to Improve the digestion and- to Insure
the prompt assimilation of food.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood, making
It thin and watery, which irritates and weaJcena
the heart.
In another way, also the heart Is affected by
the form of poor digestion, which causes gas
and fermentation from half digested food.
There. is a feeling- of oppression and heaviness
in the chest caused by pressure' of the distended
stomach on the heart and lungs, Interfering
with their action; hence arise's palpitation and
short breath.
The close relation between heart trouble and
poor digestion is because both organs- are, con-
trolled by the same great nerves â the Sympa-
thetic and Pneumogastric.
Heart trouble, at least, among the Americans,
is certainly Increasing, and while this may be
largely due to the excitement and worry of
American business life. It is more often the re-
sult of weak stomachs, of poor digestion.
Heal organic disease Is incurable; but not one
case in a hundred of heart trouble Is organic.

CHICAGO, June 20.â A i momentary firmness
prevailed In the wheat pit at the opening, oc
casioned by reports of a great scarcity of wheat
in France, together with higher cables. Re
ports of good prospects for a heavy harvest,
however, easily offset these bull features and
caused a desire to sell for future deliveries.
Holders of July were also anxious to liquidate
and the consequent decline in that month car
ried September down with it. The trading
opened a shade higher at 68%c, but dropped to
68Hc on moderate commission house selling, re
acting on reports of damage .in the Southwest,
and the close .was %c lower, at 68%c.
In the face of the weakness in wheat, corn
has shown decided strength, but the volume of
trading was small. Light receipts at primary
markets continue to be the principal ball in
fluence, giving encouragement to holders, even
after taking Into consideration the favorable
growing weather and poor shipping demand,
September closed unchanged.
Oats were the chief attraction to-day. Com
mission houses were heavy buyers. September
closed strong, %@%c' higher, at 26%@26%c. |
Provisions were dull and without any fea
tures. There was no great pressure to sell, al
though an air of weakness seemed to prevail
during the early part of the session. Firmness
in corn doubtless influenced provisions, causing
the strength in the latter half of the day. Sep
tember pork closed stronsr, z%c higher, at $15.
lard unchanged at $8 73@S 77% and ribs closed
2%c higher at i$-lV&.

transport boats which the Mexican Gov
ernment received a few months ago from
New Orleans ran Into a snag on the Rio
Hondo, where it -was engaged in service
in the Government operations against
the Maya Indians, and was sunk. BJve
members of tho crew and about twenty
Icatche Indians were drowned. Among the
latter was Chief. Tamay. -who with a del
egation of prominent men of his tribe had
been to call on General Vegfa of the Mex
ican lanny at Bacala. These Indians
were formerly in rebellion against the
Government, and Chief Tarnay's visit was
to renew the treaty, which was originally
entered into in 1S7S. They occupy a rich
section ot country in the . State of Cam
peche. Fears are entertained that Chief
Tamay's death fcy drowning while on this
mission may arouse members of his tribe.
He belonged to the peace faction, and it
was through his' efforts that the tribe did
not join the Mayas in their revolt against
the Government authorities.

NKW TORK. June 20.â Opening prices of
stocks were at the highest average level of
the day and all rallies, of which there were
several of some Flight force, were met bj
renewed realizing-, which drove prices down
ward. After the opening spurt there were
developments of strength here and there In
individual Flock*, but t..ey were Jn the class
of securities that usually have little prom
inence in the trading and -were without great
sympathetic influence on the price. The de
tent from the opening high level was con
riderable, but the telling pressure showed a
tendency to diminish when prices got down
to about last night's level. In fact there
was no severe pressure to cell at any time,
and the market reflected rather the dispo
sition of the class of large speculators .to re
frain from operations and let the market lie
fallow Burmgr the period of doubt regarding
the capacity of the money market .to afford
resources for peculation between now and
the turn of the half-yearly period. Tb* vol
ume of dealings showed a notable shrinkage
and fell below the half-million share mark
which is the lowest level touched Pine* the
Presidential election. Even this meager ag
gregate was largely dependent on the con
tested dealings in a few stocks, notably
Amalgamated Copper. This stock was under
pressure all day and fell an extreme 3% under
last niirht. Â¦with a final rally of 2 points on
the declaration of the customary 1% per cent
quarterly dividend and % per cent extra This
felling is Eald to be. In large part due to
arbitrage operations against buying of stocks
eligible for exchange. Colorado Fuel continued
Its sensational fluctuating, falling at one
time six point* under last night and 28%
under the high price of Monday, but rallying
at the last to a point above last night. Gen
eral Electric wae bought on the reported ae
quleition of the British Thomson-Houston
Company, and the stock being in very light
supply the buying lifted it 13 points by wide
Jumps. There was persistent strength in
Minneapolis and St. Louis and the Iowa Cen
tral stock*, .which rose 4 to 4% on rumors of
a merrer *nd final absorption by the Illinois
Central. The strength of Chicago Great West
ern was based on a feeling that the settle
ment of the Western railroad situation will
necessitate its control. The early strength of
the market in, eympathy with London was
clearly <Jue- to the improvement there of the
monetary fituation, where the Government Is
making haste to redisburse the sources of
Tuesday's Installment- of consols subscriptions
Doubts continue over the local money situa
tion. The Sub-Treasury has already taken
from the market $2,306,000, which include* the
payments for the gold exported. The sale at
auction sit Washington to-day . to satisfy a
Government lien of the Sioux City and Pa
olfle linilwsr Company to the Chicago and
Northvft-u-rn will involve tt.e further payment
to the Government of nearly 12,000,000. al
though a period of twenty days Is permitted
The rise In New York exchange at Chicago
to twenty-five cents' premium per thousand
shove that the Interior is responding to the
pressure for funds ' at New York. The very
heavy requirements incident to the unprece
dented Interest and dividend disbursements on
July 1. which must be met .next ' week, ad

Six workmen on the Central Bank vault
job owe" their lives to an accidental call
which took them from the pit Into which
an eleven-ton fteel vault was being low

tackle broke and let the mass of metal
fall with a crash to the bottom.
The vault had been raised Â¦ upon skids
just before the accident and was being
slowly lowered Into the pit. where the
men were waiting to guide It into place,
when, a hitch occurred which, required
their assistance above. The last man was
clambering over the edge of the excava

sioners compelling all patrolmen to work
nine hours a day and fifteen hours every
forty days has caused dissatisfaction
among the members of the department-
Many of them claim that the new order
will have the effect of driving some of the
older men out of the business.
Learning that the "coppers" were op
posed to the nine-hour-a-day system.
Chief of Police Sullivan yesterday issued
orders to the various captains to have tha
men vote on the proposition, to determine
how many were- opposed to having the
number of working hours changed. After
the votes are counted. the Chief will ask
the Commissioners, provided that the ma
jority is against it, to repeal the order.
The exact day on which the voting: is to
take place will be agreed upon to-morrow.
It is needless to say, considering the ad
verse criticism of the new order, that tha
majority will vote against it. Chief Sul
livan is satisfied that the proposition will
be hopelessly beaten, and he will then ask;
the Commissioners to stand by the pres
ent system of working the men.
"It would be a great injustice to tha
members of the force If the new order
was enforced." remarked one of the old
est men in the business yesterday.
"If it were put into operation we would
not be able to have our evening meal un
til after 9 o'clock, which, under the pres
ent system, is about the hour we retire
to get some needed rest.
"I am satisfied that about nine-tenths of
the men will vote against the new order."

according to McLaughlin, he remained on

Edith Henry, daughter of ex-Mayor A. C-
Henry. and Frank W. McLaughlin. sec
ond officer of the- transport Hancock,
which occurred Monday evening at the
residence of the bride's parents, 1221 Har

on McLaughlin's heart, and that he case
her aside without the formality- of break-
Ing the engagement Miss Martyn has a
batch of correspondence, which shÂ© uses
as a basis for her claims that the trans
port officer was betrothed to her and
she intimates that she may bring a ault
for breach of promise.
Miss Martyn says her acquaintance with
McLaughlin began in 1899. when she was
introduced to him while he was In tha
transport service. They became engaged
and matters ran along smoothly enough
until she discovered a letter in his state
room one day that had been written by
Miss Henry in very endearing style.
"1 demanded an explanation." said MlS3
Martyn. "and was assured that there was
no thought on Mr. McLaughlin's part of
a marriage with Miss Henry. I last saw
Mr. McLaughlin a week ago Sunday. Ha
spent the night with my folks and left
Monday, promising to come the following

I would not believe It. My sister, who

JUBILEE PICNIC
St. Peter's Parishioners
Enjoy Outing in Sun
set Park.
The jubilee picnic of St. Peter's parish
was held yesterday amid the shady glens
and densely wooded hills of Sunset Park,
in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three spe
cial trains were required to convey the
Immense crowd to the grounds and it was
estimated that 3500 people attended the
outing. In all respects it was one of the
most successful parochial picnics that
was ever sent out from this city.
From the moment the picnickers reach
ed the park until their reluctant depar
ture late in the afternoon the mirth and
jollity never aoated for an instant. Danc
ing, games and races were in continual
progress. Of all the contests, however,
the j5g dancing probably excited the most
interest. Each contestant was required
to dance a reel and jig to the accompani
ir-ent of a fiddle. For the ladles Mrs.
Margaret Sicotte and Mrs. M. Sullivan
carried off the laurels, while for the men
Captain Phllgate and Ed Barry were ad
judged the victors.
The picnic this year was surrounded
with a particular interest on account of
its following so close upon the Rev. Fath
er P. S. Casey's silver jubilee. Twenty
live years ago this month he was or
dained a j>rlest and since that time he
has almost continually % been the beloved
pastor of St. Peter's parish. The money
derived from the picnic will be devoted to
the construction of a new parochial resi
dence. Â»
The priesthood of the city was well rep
re;-ented at the picnic. Among those pres

pany, a large sum of money, hoping that
she would come to his rescue with her
wealth and shield him from disgrace and
the penitentiary.
But the bride was made of sterner
stuff. She realized that she had been
duped, that Borlini had married her not
for love but to get her to assist him out
of his trouble. She did not hesitate as
to which course to take. She left her hus
band immediately, coming home alone
and leaving him to follow.
There was nothing else for Borlini to do
The plaintiff Is the daughter of Mrs.
Margaret Olcese of 1030 Sixteenth street.
She is a handsome young woman,
and before her marriage was quite prom
inent in society circles. The Olcese-Bor
lini wedding was one of the. events of
Oakland society a year ago. .-â¢ -
Borlini made several attempts toward
reconciliation with his wife, but she re
mained obdurate, refusing to entertain
any proposals from him. The where
abouts of Borlini is at present unknown to
the wife.
It was only through the efforts of in
fluential friends that Borllnl escaped the
penitentiary. They came to his rescue at
the critical time and made good the
amount of his stealings, upon the under
standing that ha would not be prosecuted.
The American Bank and Trust Company
kept its promise and Borllnl was after
ward allowed to go free. He was never
placed under arrest, but was detained un
der the surveillance of detectives, for two
weeks.
then than to confess his peculations to
his employers. This he did, with the re
sult that he suffered arrest and his down
fall was told broadcast. It was in vain
that Borlini's employers searched for a
clew to the cause of his peculations. He
was not addicted to drink and he did not
gamble. The only explanation apparently
was that his expensive habits led- him into
temptation. Borlini himself would not
tell what it was that brought ruin upon
him.

% "WASHINGTON, June 20^-Civll govern
ment will be established in the Philip
pines on July i. ' Judge William H. Taf t
will be designated as Civil Governor. He
will remain at the head of the Philippine
Commission, which is to be continued.
The order creating him Civil Governor
will be issued by the President through
the Secretary of "War. . â¢ '
Further details regarding the new gov
ernment are yet to be worked out. The
4th of July is not selected with a view
of having -an extraordinary inauguration
of the new government but simply be
cause the day is deemed by the adminis
tration a good day upon which to locate
what is. believed to be an auspicious
event in the history of the Philippines.
It is probable that members of the Philip

different departments of the government.
. MANILA, June 20. â The provost marshal
has decided to accept an ordinary bond
for the release of D. M. Carman, the Cali
fornian arrested last February on charges
of having furnished the insurgents with
arms, ammunition .and supplies. He has
been held Â«under a bond of 510,000, but it
was decided last month not to prosecute
him at present, and he applied for a
reduction of bail prior to returning to the
United States.
Carman has received permission to leave
the islands for an Indefinite period, sub
ject, however, to the call of the Govern
ment. The action of the -provost marshal
tends to confirm the report already cabled
of the probability of Carman's Â¦ ultimate
dismissal.
Civil. Rule Will Begin
on the Fourth of
TAFT TO GOVERN
THE PHILIPPINES
Mr. Walsh said that he could finish in
one day and Judge Frick thought that the
same amount of time would suffice for his
argument. The State will close on
Wednesday, so that on that day the case
will probably go to the jury.
It was expected that Brandes would go
upon the stand. in his own behalf. He has
repeatedly told his jailers that he should
insist upon doing so. When the other
witnesses for the defense had been exam
ined the accused called his attorney to
consult with him. After some minutes*
animated conversation Attorney Frick
announced that the defense rested. Frick
opposed the introduction of Brandes' tes
timony at the former trial when it was
offered by the prosecution earlier in the
trial, but Judge Ogden decided to allow
the transcript to be read to the jury on
the ground that it was an admission of
the prisoner touching the question of his
guilt or innocence. â¢ .
When the case closed Deputy District
Attorney Walsh told the court he was
ready to proceed with the argument for
the prosecution, but Judge Frick asked
for a continuance until Monday to look
over the evidence.
The attorneys finally agreed to the con
tinuance. Â«
In rebuttal of this theory the prosecu
tion put witnesses on the stand to testify
that the noises were apparently made by
a soft body being thrown against the
walls of the house rather than by slam
ming doors. This testimony closed the
case.
The defense explained the noises of sup
posed beating heard by Brandes' neigh
bors on the night before the girl died as
caused by the slamming of doors in the
search for the money.^ which Lillian was
accused of stealinsr. v
The defense In the case of William A.
Brandes on the charge of murdering his
daughter Lillian closed to-day with the
testimony of Attorney F. W. Sawyer, who
identified a knife as one that was intro
duced at the former trial as the weapon
with which the girl attacked her step
mother shortly before the day of her
death.- . .-â¢ â¢ â¢
This evidence completes the chain of
evidence upon which Brandes relies .to
divert suspicion from himself, the other
links being the son's testimony that Mrs.
Brandes severely beat Lillian on the oc
casion of the alleged attack, and Mrs.
Brandes' own statement tliat her testi
mony, if given, would tend to incriminate
her. Â¦ i Â¦ ' Â¦ â¢ .

BERKELEY. June 20.â Dr. H. N. Ro
wen, the attending physician, declares
that under no circumstances shall Miss
Agnes Adams testify to-morrow at the
Inquest In the case of Dr. John G. Jessup.
Â¦who was shot by her father while he
tvas drink-crazed. The medico's fiat was
delivered this evening: when inquiry was
made concerning the condition of the
young woman whose appeal for assistance
brought death to her friend and accusa
tion of murder against her wretched
father. .
The physician explained . his emphatic
Ftand by declaring that his patient, tor
tured by the awful recollection of the
scene at the Adams residence and pros
trated by the mental and nervous shock,
was in no condition to undergo the ordeal
of a public examination such as the law
enforced a* n duty upon the Coroner.
"No, sir." insisted the. medical man.
"Miss Adams cannot go to the inquest,
and I shall under no condition think of
permitting such a course. She is hysteri
cal and distraught, ill mentally and physi
cally, and it would he a crime to send her
f>ut of her room at this time."
The Coroner has left the subpenaing
of witnesses In the hands of Deputy Cor
oner Streightiff. Dr. Rowell maintains
that he will not permit Mis=s Adams to
be subpenaed. Coro-er Mehrmann has
pet the Inquest for to-morrow morning at
9 o'clock, and it will go on at that hour.
Miss Adams* testimony will be required
by the Coroner, as she was the only per
son who saw any of the occurrences im
mediately attending the shooting of Dr.
Jessup.
Coroner Mehrmann said to-night that
he had no Aou\.t Miss Adams could give
her depesition before him and that he
would be prepared to take it at her pres
ent stopping place if she were unable to
be present at the Coroner's office.
Arrangement* for the funeral of Dr.
Jessup to-morrow afternoon have about
been completed. There will be addresses
by representatives of the organizations of
which th<* deceased dentist was a mem
ber. P. G. Bstts will speak for the Ju
nior Order of American Mechanics and F.
I* Wharff for the Cherokee Tribe of Red
Men. Other eulogists have yet to be se
lected. The funeral will take place from
Odd Fellows' Hall at 2 o'clock.
Will Not Testify Regarding
Shooting of Dr. Jessup
by Her Father.
Dr. Rowell Says She
Cannot Appear at
the Inquest.

Before he was lynched last night Smith
confessed that he had ' loaded the gun
with which Foster was Killed. Many let
ters of an incendiary character written by
Smith and his followers have been found.

Scores of ways in which the fruit may
be prepared will be. shown, and each vis
itor to the Pavilion will be given a small
box of prunes to carry back to friends in
the East. . Humboldt County, among oth

WASHINGTON, June' 20.â The report. of
Major,. General" Chaff ee on the campaign
in. China is being prepared for publication
at the War Department.'.^ Among other
matters it contains special reports upon
the Russian, Japanese, French and Brit
ish troops ; also reports on equipment,
supplies. | etc. , of ' foreign Â¦Â¦ troops, and re
ports on different expeditions. These re
ports were made by United States officers,
and from a military point of view are of
considerable, interest, but nearly all the
main facts have Â¦ heretofore- been pub
lished. Some of General i Chaffee's com
ments are interesting. .At one point he
says: Â¦ ' : .- - :. "- Â¦â¢ - ;Â¦ â¢ â¢Â¦ . Â¦-.
.. For about three weeks following the arrival
of the relief column at Peking the condition
In and about the city and along the line of
communication was -badâlooting of the city;
uncontrolled foraging In the surrounding coun
try and seizure by soldiers â¢ of everything a
Chinaman misrht j have,* . as . vegetables, eggs,
chickens, sheep, â¢ cattle, etc., when being
brought to the city or found- on -the farms;
indiscriminate and generally unprovoked shoot
ing Of Chinese In city, country and along : the
line of march -and the riverâ all this did not
tend,' as waa natural, to gain for the troops
the confidence of the masses, with whom . It . la
certain we have no quarrel, but were In need
of their labor. 1 . It. is safe to say that where
one- real Boxer has been killed since the cap
ture of Peking fifty harmless coolies or labor
ers on farms, including: not a. few women and
children, have been slain. No doubt the Boxer
element Is largely, mixed with the mass of
population, and by slaying a lot . one or more
Boxers might be taken in. [ - . .
General Chaffee speaks of the restraint
he placed on American troops. The Jap
anese commander also made it known
that general warring on all classes was
not intended. . r> â¢
Damages Done by Boxers.
General Chaffee said he opposed enter
ing the Forbidden City unless looting waa
prohibited. This was agreed to, and he
thinks but little looting -has been done
there, though . articles have been offered
for sale said to have been taken from the
Forbidden City, - ;
E. G. Tewksbury of the Congregational
Missionary Society furnished General
Chaffee the following list of damages
done by the Boxers to Chinese Christians
or adherents of the Congregational mis
sion as a basis of settlement:
Number killed, 166; houses'' destroyed,
184; money, 16,150 taels; land formerly oc
cupied by missions, 9S acres; chapels, 16;
cemeteries, 30.
Major W. E. Craighill, reporting on the
Russian, soldiers, says: "The information
gained of the Russian forces was meager
and unsatisfactory. No reply was made
by them' to your request for a statement
of the location v and .character of their
force present In North China, in accord
ance with the, relief expedition." -
He speaks of the excellent discipline of
the Russian trooDS, but says. they were
industrious foragers. I They used no tent
age, but lived in huts made of native mat
ting. :Â»â¢;. -Â¦ . â¢ .
> Foreign Troops Commended.
Major Charles H. Mulr descrlbed\the
Japanese troops In detail and concluded
by saying: . Â¦ ' - ' â¢ i
The Japanese soldier receives almost no pay,
but Is actuated by Intense patriotism. If
Japan can keen the armament and equipment
on, a par with her soldiers she is a most de
sirable ally and a most formidable enemy..
Major W. E. Cralghill reports upon the
French soldiers as to arms, supplies, etc.,
but his comments; like nearly all others,
are , omitted . from the -publication, beins
represented by rows of asterisks.
Lieutenant Colonel Dickman reports
upon the Germans. He says the German
officers are well ' educated and the troops
under good" discipline.- The* same officer
reports on the British troops. He speaks
of the painstaking detail in the mobiliza
tion and dispatching of the expeditionary
force. The discipline of the troops is ex
cellent. , .. â¢
Major W. J. Bannister reports upon the
medical departments of the allied armies.
One interesting fact mentioned is that the
British and Indian soldiers are not treated
in* the same Held r ispital and separata
hospitals are provided.
The Japanese and German medical de
partments are commended.

CHINA CAMPAIGN
UNDER REVIEW
A. C. Campbell addressed the commis
sion in opposition to awarding the con
tract for a particular kind of coal. .Camp
bell argued that calling for a specific coal
prohibited bidders outside of the combina
tion from bidding. - He asked that bids bo
invited simply for coal, which "would in
sure competition and lower prices. The
award of the coal contract was laid over
until Saturday. Similar action was taken
with the contract for hose and straw.
President Watt said that the bids would
be open to the public to-day, when the
lowest price submitted could be .scanned
by all interested parties..
"I will agree to furnish this, department
with 1000 or 5000 tons of hay at $10 per
ton, 'V said Piercy, "if the commission will
give me a bond that I will be paid for It.
There are too many contractors who have
been: obliged to "sue the city for their
money and I do not want to be placed In
that > dilemma."- â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ \
President Watt informed Piercy that the
city could not give a bond.
Piercy finally agreed to file a bid.
i Coal Award Laid Over.
E. M. Piercy of San Jose, Â¦who had sub
mitted a proposition to the commission to
furnish hay at $1& 50 per ton, addressed
the board. President Watt, explained that
the commission could not go in open mar
ket to buy hay and asked Piercy if he
would submit a bid.
J After- the firm had made Its explanation
Commissioner Hecht introduced the reso
lution, which was unanimously adopted.
"In presenting this resolution," said Mr.
Hecht, "I feel that it is our plain duty to
order new bids, in view of the statements
contained in the press and the private ad
vicea received from intending bidders. It
is clear that the price submitted to us is
higher than that to another department
of the city government. "While the ex
planation of the interested bidders may be
plausible, it seems to me that, the only
course left open to us is to invite, new
proposals." - :
Previous to the adoption of the resolu
tion President Watt asked Scott & Mag
ner to explain why they had bid $12 9S per
ton for hay used by tho Fire Department,
whereas their rate for the park was $10 50
and $9 50, according to quality. The mem
bers of the firm replied that the park con
tract was for a period of six mouths only
and storage of tne hay was not necessary,
as in the case of the Fire Department.
Insurance was also avoided, as the hay
was shipped direct from the field and a
second hauling was avoided in. the same
way. The Fire Department, on the other
hainij required two hauls, and the board
insisted on first quality. *Â»a
Excessive Sid Explained.
Resolved. That ! a eopy of these resolutions
be Â»ent to said newspaiwrs, with the request
that they be asked to procure bids - for . this
department from such dealets upon whose In
formation they published -the statement to
which reference is made in the second pre
amble of this resolution. Â¦ Â¦"Â¦.". \
Resolved. That all bids for hay be rejected
and. that the Board of Fire Commissioners re
advertl&e for new bids. And be It further Â¦
Whereas, There having been much agitation
in. tome of -the newspapers of this city, upon
the I excessive prices named j In bids for- . the
supply of hay to this municipality, and where
as, the lowest bid for delivery to the Fire
Department is $12 98 per ton, which, . accord
ing to said papers Is from $2 to H per ton
more than 'the actual price for hay; therefore
be" It . ' .. â¢-'< : â¢ Â¦_Â¦. '.,:â¢Â¦
.Tho Board of Fire ' Commissioners de
cided last night that the price submitted
by Scott & Magner for hay to be ; fur
nished to the Fire Department during- the
next fiscal year was- too high, and a reso
lution was adopted ordering the advertis
ing for | new bids. The resolution directs
attention to tho agitation . of tb,e press
against the excessive prices named in the
bids, which was corroborated , by letters
received by the board from farmers and
dealers in tho commodity. The resolution

James K. Ross, attorney at law, after

took him into i custody on'a charge of ob

It was also determined. that Mrs. Cra

she should give up the deeds. The appeal
which was carried to the Supreme Court
and the point now finally settled Involves
only the question as to the right of a jury
trial. This decision, however, practically
settles the dispute. â¢ .
There remains but one step to be taken,
and that -is a petition to the Superior
Court for a new trial to determine wheth

to make an appeal on this* issue to the

Mrs. Craven is at present contesting for

he Is affable and companionable. This Is
his third term as chairman of the Rivers
and Harbors Committee, to which posi
tion he was advanced over three ranking
members because of his encyclopedic
knowledge of the waterways of the entire
country.
During the trip yesterday Congressman
Burton was busy . every minute. â¢ Ho
leaned out of a window of the pilot house
and scanned every object, or questioned
Colonel Heuer closely as to shoals or tides
or currents. He studied charts and made
notes upon them, and dictated facts and
figures to his stenographer.
When the start was made from Mission
street wharf it was Chairman Burton who
asked that the steamer go around the
west arid north of Angel Island in order
that he might study Raccoon Straits, and
Colonel Heuer said with some local pride
that he would show him a tide as strong
as that at Hell Gate.
Steamers along the water front whistled
a salute as the General Frisble passed.
Arch Rock was passed to port, and the
steamer ran in fairly close to Sausalito
harbor and then headed dead against the
current of Raccoon Straits. y
The opposite shore of the bay was ap
proached near Crockett, and the General
Frlsbie steamed along at a rapid rate over

of survey of the proposed deepened chan

up Napa Creek, had naught in it but
pleasant incidents, and the Congressmen
returned to San Francisco enthusiastic
over the day's excursion.
The trip up the bay was made on the
General Frisble, and the ladies of the
party returned on the same Eteamer In the
afternoon. The Congressmen took Â« a
launch ride up Napa Creek, returned to
Vallejo by train and thence back to San
Francisco on the S!ocum.
The morning was not auspicious. The
sky was overcast and a raw wind was
blowing, but before Port Costa was
reached the sun had come out and during
the remainder of the day perfect weather
was enjoyed. ,
What the results will be can scarcely
be forecast, even in the most general wav.
The members of the committee are not
given, to expressing intentions. The Items
to be included in a rivers and harbors bill

of all parts of the country are considered

VICTORY AGAIN
GOES TO FAIRS
Nettie Craven's Petition
for a Rehearing Is
Denied. W&
The Supreme Court yesterday denied
Mrs. Nettie Craven's petition for a re
hearing of her appeal for a Jury trial In
the matter cf the alleged forged deeds
â¢which involved two pieces of San Fran
cisco real estate valued at $1,000,000.
The appeal was taken from the ruling
of the lower court, which declared that as
equitable and legal rights were both af
fected In the contest It had the preroga
tive of controlling the order of proof an<l
was therefore Justified in adjudicating the
equitable issues; Mrs. Craven's attorney*
contended that the case was one of law
and not of equity, and that 'she was en
titled to a. Jury trial.
The Supreme Court affirmed the decision
of the Superior Court. Justice Temple
alone dissenting. The petition for a re
hearing was taken as a last resort, and
the court's decision finally settles the con
tention for a trial by jury. . â¢
The lower court found. that-all. the ma
terial facts alleged by the Fair heirs were
supported by the proof and issued an In
junction forever restraining Mrs. Craven
"from * asserting or . pretending that the
were traversed. The Government en
gineers have recommended the' dredging
of a 300-foot channel to a depth of thirty
feet for- a distance of four miles across
the shoals. The estimated cost Is $381,000.
It is this project which is nearest the
hearts of shipping men of San Francisco
and which also has the support of all
who befriend the interests of Vallejo and
the Mare Island Navy Yard. ,
