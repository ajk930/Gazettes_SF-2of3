"Sparks from adjacent chimney" Is as
signed as the cause of the fire by Captain
Comstock of the Underwriters* Fire Pa
troL Theorists differ somewhat with the
veteran as to the cause. Some remark
able conditions existed. The hottest place
evidently was under the water-soaked
washroom, where the horses were burned.
To the east, toward Day's blacksmith
Bhop, and on the floor above, where tho
employes slept and where many of the
vehicles were stored, the fire also raged.
The flames took an irregular course and a
great smoke was produced.
According to Dr. Creeley, the veterinary
surgeon, horses require much oxygen. The
stable was well ventilated, access was
easy, at least to the upper floors, yet the
lives of three human beings and sixty
four horses went out like a flash.
About an hour and a half previous to
the flre In the Derby stable flre broke out
In the rear of the barn of A- M. Grant &
Co., 11 and 16 Golden Gate avenue. Two
alarms were turned in and ten horses
were suffocated by smoke. Fortunately
before the fire had gained great headway
the horses were rescued, but several have
since died and others are still suffering
from the inhalation of smoke, and several
of them may succumb.
Horse owners and. stablemen, reviewing
the frequent fires In the rear portions of
stables, are asking themselves. "What
causes these frequent fires, and what
deadly gas does burning straw give forth
Â¦ that such disastrous results follow?"
i The Derby stables were purchased by
Morton a little more than three years ago.
They were formerly owned by G. B.
Morsehead. and for r.ecrly twenty years
previously by Theodore Ross, the Jockey,
who rode Thad, Stevens to victory at the
Ocean House track 11. a four-mile and re
peat race. So far It has passed through,
three fires, but never with such disas
trous results as the last one.
Cause of the Fire.
Flre Marshal Towe claims that a burn-
cued, but the â¢ balance ] died ' either In their
stalls or Just without, after having broken
their halters in i vain - efforts â¢' to escape."
The Â¦ valuable' horses were 'on the main
floor. On the lower floor, about where the
flre started, eight ! horses were burned to
death. . It was here that the fire in the
straw raged the fiercest.
Eyewitnesses say that the flames ran up
the outside of the building at a point be
tween the dwelling at 516 Leavenworth
street and the blacksmith shop of James
Day at the eastern end of .the stable.
Scenes of wild consternation followed.
The guests of the Hotel MIramar, which
Is Just across the street, the lodgers with
Mrs. A. Bray at 591 Geary street. Im
mediately above the stables, the occu
pants of the house3 on Leavenworth
street, and others In the vicinity made
hasty preparations for departure. But
the fire was conquered before It had
spread beyond the stable.
ing doormat hanging on the balustrade
of the stairs leading to the yard in the
rear of 616 Leavenworth street was Ig
nited in some. manner, and fanned by the
southerly breeze set fire to the rear end
of the stable. The straw In the stables
then caught, and before the watchman
discovered it the flre had made great
progress. Some say that Munroe had
gone out for his supper prior to calling
the morning watch, and that the flre had
made such headway before his return
that escape for the animals on
the lower floor was impossible.' In
Day's blacksmith shop many vehicles
were under a canvas cover. Thla took
fire and the buggies were consumed. The
flames spread a short distance through
the lower and rear upper parts of the
building.
Slight damage was done to the dwelling
at 516 Leavenworth street, owned by E.
Best, and occupied by Mrs. Hughes and!
family. Her kitchen abuts the stable on.
the south, and the outer portion was dam
aged to the extent of about $150. She
was awakened by a lodger, Mrs. Her
ewith.
Thomas J. Morton, son of. Former Sup
ervisor Thomas Morton, was the owner of
the stable. The building was insured for
$3000 Jn the German-American Insurance*
Company, but there was no insurance on
the contents. Morton estimates his loss
at about $10,000. exclusive of that on the
building. Of the sixty-four horses, twen
ty-five .were boarders. As far as known,
Dr. Krotoszyner was the only one who
had his animals Insured.
Valuable Animals Lost.
Dr. C. F. Buckley lost two doubls
teams: Dr. Renz a double team: Harry
Koenig a pacer, over which he shed, tears:
Edward Sachs lost a horse for which ha
refused $1000 a few days ago. This horse
died peacefully In. its stall, with Its head
between its forefeet, apparently without
a struggle.
Mrs. A. Bray, who occupies the lodging
house Immediately above the stable, suf
fered slight loss, occasioned by the hasty
moving of her furniture. She purchased
doors and. windows in dense volumes. Ly
ing in stalls, upon the several floors, near
ly three score of horses died. Many of
these were valuable animals, but there
were human beings asleep in the building,
and the firemen directed their efforts In
' attempts to save them.
Bodies of Stablemen Found.
The flre fighters were heavily handi
capped by the smoke. They groped their
way in the darkness to the runway lead-
Ing to the upper floor and there, partially
burned, was found the body of Charles
Toung. In the sleeping-room of the stable
employes, on the floor above, they found
the bodies of James Richard White and
Charles White, who had been overtaken
by death as they slept.
James White, or "Dick," had been In the
employ of Morton for a year and a halfâ
his brother, for only ten days. Both were
single' men. Charles Toung had been em

Fast Losing Prestige in the Valley
of the Yang-tse.
LONDON. March 11. â Commenting edi

States Government toward the Manchu

"Apparently the "Washington Govern
ment rely upon the moving force of their
exhortations to induce Russia to abandon
the convention or China to refuse to sign
it. The reed seems desperately broken."
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times, who sends a long account of the
waning of British influence in the Yang
tse Valley, says:
"Five years ago British Interests and
Influence were predominant and unchal
lenged, but to-day not only is the Yang
tse not a British sphere In the sense In
which Manchuria Is Russian and Shan
tung German, hut it is steadily growing
less English and more international. The
whole country is overrun with German,
French. Belgian Hnd Swiss en pincers and
traders, who are exploring Its mineral
wealth and commercial resources, while
two. German lines are briskly competing
with their shipping on the river; formerly
a British monopoly. One advantage the
British still possess. over other powers in
the valley is the confidence and good will
of the better class of the people and of
the officials of Central China."

Tills Audience at Emmet
Gathering That Erin Is
Ready for Fray.
NEW YORK,. March" 10.â The one hun
dred and twenty-third anniversary of the
birth of Robert Emmet, the Irish pat
riot martyr, was celebrated under Â¦ the
auspices of the Clan-na-Gael to-night by
a concert and mass meeting In the Acad
emy of Music. Tho oration was delivered
by Mayor John Daly of Umerlck, who
appeared on the platform with the gold
links of office around his neck. Mayor
Daly after thanking the audience ln the
name of the corporation of Limerick and
the people of Ireland for thÂ© cordial re
ception given him, said in part:
\om may realize the significance of Limer
ick's Mayor addressing you on this memorable
occasion when you learn that he was Invited
to attend a meeting in honor of the Queen
less than a year ago. He did not accept that
Invitation because Limerick's Mayor, Limer
ick's people or Limerick's corporation had no
stomach for honoring England's Queen. L4m-'
erick's people, however, have a place for their
kindred ln America, and selected their Mayor,
who had worn shackles for his. country and
now wears those- golden links as a reward. for
his fealty to the old cause, as a fitting repre
sentative to send to, Chicago and New York.
Mayor Daly devoted some time to eulo
gizing tho services of Emmet and then
turned his attention to tho task of scor
ing-England for her treatment of Ireland
and the South African republics. Along
this line he said:
,. T . h . e .. Irl ! h P e Â°P le to-day cannot take to the
hillsides because they have no arms and the
standing garrison is too powerful. There is
plenty of space in South Africa and I can
tell you -that the new generation ln Ireland
possesses the spirit of rebellion, and the ex
ample set by the Boers has made them ready
for the fray. ; Â« .Â»
Good men tell us that the only hope for Ire
land is the burning of London. I am not tak
ing that Job because It Is too big a one. but
if there is any man who thinks .he can go
over and do In London what. Kitchener is do
ing in the Transvaal I will not try to stop
him. â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦ .

WASHINGTON. March 10.â Did Con
prers during the last session inadvertent
ly authorise thÂ» construction of two bat
tleships and tvo armored cruisers? is a
question agitating officials of the N'avy
Department. Aft^r diroctinsr the prepa
ration of plans and specifications for these
vessels, the Secretary to submit a general
description of them to Congress at Its
meeting next December, the naval appro
priations law reads:
"And the Secretary of the Navy is here
by authorized to exercise his discretion
p.s to the Bheathin? and coppering of
T.aval vessels herein and heretofore
authorized to be built."
S**eretary Lnnp has referred the ques
tion to the board of construction, and
some of its members appear to consider it
one well worth obtaining a legal opinion
upon. No appropriation If made for ves
f^ls. tmt Jt is pointed out that there is no
prohibition imposed upon the awarding of
eontrarts. and the law Fpeciflcally states
that "for the purpose of further Increas
ing the naval establishment of the United
States in accordance with the latest Im
provements in the construction of ships
nnd the production of armor and arma
ment therefor, the Secretary is directed
to prepare plans and specifications/'
Secretary Long seems to be of the opin
ion that even lf the law does give him dis
cretion as to sheathing and coppering of
the "naval vessels- herein authorized,"
Congress did not contemplate permitting
him to award contracts. The board of
construction will probably strongly op
pose the sheathing of any additional
ships.

WASHINGTON. March 10,-It appears
that the trouble at the naval observa

whether the observatory should be under
the superintendency - of a lino officer of
the navy or a professional astronomer
The latter view has been held by the as
tronomical profession at Â»argÂ© and also
by such secretaries as Secretary Tracy
and Secretary Long. | This is not founded
upon the finding of persona cuallfled la
the line of the navy or upon any dissat
isfaction with tho incumbent, but upon
the fact that the frequent changes of duty
to which naval officers are subject at
short Intervals prevents continuity of ad
ministration and also unon tho principle
that the appointment of superintendent*
ehmid be made from persons in or out of
the naval service without restriction to
any class, and that the observatory
should secure the most accomplished and
competent astronomer that can bÂ© found
anywhere.

Serious offense was taken more because
of the form of presenting the American
proposals and the Senate amendment than
because of their substance. The result
is at present a feeling of bitterness, which
shows no sign of abatement. An opinion
is frequently expressed here that it is not
yrt too late to adjust what is regarded
as a misunderstanding if a committee
from the Cuban convention be invited to
Object to the Method Employed.
Optimistic official reports concerning the
readiness of the Cuban convention to
yield find no confirmation here in state
ments written by members of the Inde
pendence party In a bitter tone and de
claring that the JÂ»latt amendment -was
passed by the American Congress because
Congress was misled regarding the actual
Fituation. The real truth is that an un
fortunate mistake was made by American
Interference Â¦with the processes of the con
vention before the work was completed.
There was almost :i certainty that the
Cuban committee on relations would
have adopted the proposals then under
discussion granting coaling stations, lim
iting the military occupation and Ameri
can supervision of the island's foreign re
lations.

not to recede. Members declare that they
cannot accept the Senate amendment. A
committee probably will meet to-morrow
afternoon to draft a reply to the Amer
ican proposal. The reply will then be sub

CUBAN DELEGATES SAY
THEY WILL NOT RECEDE
terian Church of Los Angeles.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 10.
Rev. Robert P. Coyle, for nine years
pastor of the FlrBt Presbyterian, Church
of this city, Is coming back to this coast.
It was given out at the First Presbyterian
Church to-day that the former pastor of
that church had accepted a call from, the
First Presbyterian Church of Los Ange
les and. that he would leave his Denver
home very shortly for the Southern Cali
fornia cits*.
Dr. Coyle left Oakland last fall and bj
hlnd this Los Angeles call there Is a little
story that Involves his old church In Oak
land. After Dr. Coyle had left Oakland
for Denver ha began to regret his change.
He liked Oakland and was liked by his
church and his determination to leave was
caused by his feeling that he might do
better in a new field of work. He decided
flatly that he would go to Denver and
that he would listen to no inducements
from his Oakland church and said so very
decidedly. He gave them several months'
notice, but the Oakland congregation did
not secure a new pastor until very recent
ly, when Rev. E. E. Baker of Cleveland
accepted a call.
The Oakland church waited a long while
before extending any call at all, and th*
attendance began to seriously suffer from
the lack of a regular pastor. In this Inter
val Dr. Coyle discovered that Denver did
not agree with him and at the same time
there was renewed in his old congregation
a desire to have him return.
But before this Idea got abroad Rev. E.
E. Baker of Cleveland appeared upon the
Bcene and the church decided to extend a
call to him. Some of the adherents of
. Dr. Coyle started a movement to recall
Dr. Coyle and when It came to the meet
ing at which a call was to bo extended
they mustered some 20 votes out of a totnl
"of 130 for Dr. Coyle. Some were not sure
that Dr. Coyle would come back and final
ly the call to Dr. Baker was made unani
mous, but not until a strong vote had
been cast for the old pastor.
Now Dr. Coyle will return to the coast
and will resume his former prominent po
sition in the church affairs of the State.
Accepts a Call to the First Presby-
DB. COYLE TO . COME BACK.
Special Dispatch to Tne Call.
DENVER, March 10.â Because the pipe
organ was not placed where he wanted It;
because the acoustic properties of the
church did not suit him; because the
members of the congregation would not
come to evening services, and because the
people were scattered over such a wide
area as to make it impossible to visit all
of them without great difficulty, the Rev.
R. P. Coyle, pastor of the Central Pres
byterian Church, to-day offered his resig
nation, to take effect June 1. These were
the reasons he gave when he read his
resignation at the close of his sermon this
morning.
The resignation will be accepted. The
congregation is very angry at his sudden
action.
Dr. Coyle was brought to Denver five
months ago from the First Presbyterian
Church of Oakland, California, where he
had been for several years. The members
of the congregation regard his reasons for
resigning as trivial. What is regarded as
the real cause was not known until late
to-night, when It wag learned that several
days ago he had telegraphed his accept
ance of a call to the First Presbyterian
Church of Los Angeles. California, to be
gin his pastorate on June 1, the date fixed
in his resignation.

DUBLIN. March ; lO.âThe " Duke 'and
Duchess of Manchester arrived to-day at
.Tanderage Castle. 'LOS ANGELES, March 10.â Bishop
Montgomery addressed a large audience
to-night at a meeting held by the Social
Democrats, his subject being "Society and
Religion." He declared that the churches
are in sympathy with the workingmen;
that his church Is made up principally of
working classes and therefore is naturallv
in sympathy with the laboring classes and
their best Interests.
The ministry, he said, is largely made
up of men from the laboring classes, for
somehow the sons of the rich do not tako
kindly to the ministry. The one consola
tion is that money cannot buy and monop
olize brains and manhood. Religion is in
tended to promote all that Is best in the
true brotherhood of men. Society came
from God: hence religion, if it come*
as it should from God. must embrace all
men. He continued:
Denunciation of Trusts.
JuÂ«t now the question of trusts Is over
phadowlngr every other. I can give you my
opinion on this quection. which, however. Is
subject to ccrrcct'.on If I am wrong. I believe
that trusts arc bad and are a curse. There are
men to-day studying the trust question as
never before. The people are bonr.d to govern
through a few. There are but thre<? forces In
nature, the' moral. Intellectual and physical.
Of these the world always selects two to gov
ern, the physical and moral. The Intellectual
never has and never will govern the world.
LOSES TRESSES
WHILE SLEEPING
His Grace cited the case of the election
where fifteen representative men were
chosen as a board to settle the election
question, but when It came to a vote they
decided according to their politics, re
gardless of statesmanship, yet they were
aJl intellectual giants. The moral force,
he said, can only come by the training
of the heart through religion. There are
millions of men outside the church acting
upon religious principles: therefore the
religious force In men Is doing good out
side of its own membership and Its in
fluenco is known only to God.
The Bishop did not believe in a puritan
ical Sabbath, but in a day of rest. With
out religion there would never have been
a day of rest. He cited the differences
between civil law and God's law in that
the former punished the crime after com
mitted, while the latter prohibited tho
commission of crime by cleansing the
heart, and made it a crime to indulge In
thoughts of crime. The relation of reli
gion to society is to carry out that which
is honest. Just. pure. He hoped the tlmÂ»
would come when all International differ
ences would be settled by arbitration
rather than by bloodshed.
Poverty and Devotion.
The Biahop. In replying to the follow
ing question, ""Would a general increase
In individual wealth and education tend
toward growth and a more general ac
ceptance of the Christian religion, or does
religion and the spirit of devotion tako
deeper root in the soil of poverty and'lg
norance?'* said that It depended entirely
on the kind of education given. Unless
It was Christian education It would not.
but rather tended to Its decrease. The
increase of wealth did not ceces3arily
tend toward growth of Christianity. If.
in the new system of society a system of
education were adopted In which re
ligious training: Is divorced from secular
training, it would tend to the discredit of
Christianity. While religon and the spirit
of devotion do not take deeper root In Ig
norance and poverty, nevertheless Gotl
has given a natural reason to all men
which may be made to accept the truths
of tho Christian faith without much secu
lar knowledge. Poverty Is no bar of it
self to the spirit of devotion.

AGED "FORTY-NINER"
DIES IN WASHINGTON
Daniel V. Stevens, Who Came to
California In Early Days, Passes
Away in Seattle.
SEATTLE. March lO.-Danlel V. Ste
vens, who was one cf the original Califor
nia "forty-niners," died in this city to-day
of paralysis. He was 79 years old and up
to several weeks ago was remarkably act
ive. His right arm was broken through
an accidental fall. The bones knitted, bu:
a few days ago Mr. Stevens fell ;. again,
and the old break let no. Paralysis of one
entire side followed. From that time until
his death to-day he sank rapidly.
SEATTLE, March 10.â Schlatter, the so
called "divine healer," was arrested to-day
under orders from Chief of Police Mere
dith. Schlatter was advertised to- hold
public meetings afternoon and night, and
his arrest was, it is asserted, made in
order to prevent the gathering.
At the time of his arrest ho had more
than $700 on his person. On being .ques
tioned as to his source of income he de
clared that this money belonged to others,
and that he relied only on email gifts of
money to defray his living expenses. Ho
declared that the Lord directed all his
movements, and that nothing occurred In
his life without an intimation first coming
to him In a supernatural manner. When
asked whether Mb arrest had been super
naturally indicated to him he replied that
since Â¦ he was illegally arrested he sup
posed that fact would account for his fail
ure to receive divine warning.
It is Chief Meredith's Intention to have
Schlatter brought before the municipal
court as a faker, under tbe vagrancy law.
When asked for an explanation of tho ar
rest. Chief Meredith said:
"The arrest of this faker and confidence
man, Charles McLean, alias Schlatter,
who is duping people under the cloak of
being a religious doctor. Is the beginning
of war In this city on quack doctors.
These persons are not only bunkoing peo
ple out of their money,' but robbing them
of health as well. The amount of dam
age done by theso quacks Is Incalculable.
If Is the poor people that they prey upon.
I am not going to allow all the quack doc
tors who have been driven out of other
cities to come here, and those who are
here had better seek other fields."
Schlatter yesterday on seeing that he
could not persuade his listeners that he
should not be Illegally arrested, assumed
the air of a martyr, and declared that
whatever was the will of the Lord would
be done. Schlatter was followed to Jail
by crowds as soon as his arrest became
known, and women offered to put up ball
for him.

1 Bill With Papinta and Others.
IT was "standing room only" last
night at the California Theater long
before the 8 o'clock mark, with the
latest farce comedy success "The
Telephone Girl" as the programme.
All of those who - have ever called up
"Central" and spent hot and hapless mo
ments trying to "make her understand,"
seemed to be there, or trying to obtain a
glimpse of the modern oracle in her lair.
"The Telephone Girl" is worth seeing and
hearing. Not since the Dunne and Ryley
engagement last season has such clever
work of the musical farce comedy kind
been done here. The book, by Hugh Mor
ton, is distinctly bright and original, the
songs, by Gustave Kerker, will be In ac
tive circulation 5 within the weekâ more
especially "My Estello"â and the settings
and costumes leave nothing to be desired.
There are any number of pretty girls In
the chorus, and out of it. Mabel Hite Is
a fetching soubrette, and as Estelle Coo
coo won much applause. Flora Parker is
another pretty "hello girl." Louise Lewis
is an altogether charming Samanthy,
Margie Ford does a good tough girl,
"Toots," and Jeanne Bernard is well seen
as Beauty Fairfax.
Harry Hermsen as Hans Nix does a
simply, irresistible Deutpcher â one cf the
best hits of comic Dutch character' work
that has ever been seen here. Frank Kel
ly, a former California boy. does well as
Dick Marvel and develo~s the only voice
In the crowd. John J. Magee as Saunders.
an Irish butler, Edward 'Lehay and
Charles Bu.rows all do good work, and
Â¦\Vinfield Douglas as Snurrtes dljp^ays an
eloquent foot and a voice fearful and
wonderful in its quality.
"The Telephone Girl" will go.

Seekers of melodrama will find all they
desire In the p'.ay "Under Sealed Orders,"
which was produced yesterday at the Al
hambta, beginning a week's run. The cen
tral figure, a French hypnotist, is basod
upon Du Maurier's famous creation, and
a crime committed under telepathic sug
gestion forms the principal th<Â»me of the
play. While the majority of the charac
ters are exaggerated, they are permissi
ble in melodrama, and the actors give the
various roles heightened coloring. "Under
Scaled Orders" caught the fancy of a
crowded hou.Â«e. and cheers were accorded
the hero and his sweetheart. whUe the
villains were cordially hooted and hissed.
The company is a good one and should
succeed in filling the theater during the

llmlnarie\ for a bloody conflict commenced
as soon as the challenge for battle was

The leading members of the trade or

headquarters last night and urged that as

prevent murder. .
The Suey Din Tong held a banquet In
the Woey Sen Low restaurant, at S08 Du
pont street. Saturday night. The party
dispersed about 2 o'clock -Sunday morning
and the president with a number of his
friends started for their homes. "When
they reached tho corner of Washington
street they were assaulted by members
of the Hop Sing Tong and badly beaten.
Police whistles were blown, but the as
sailants made their escape before the ar
rival of the officers.
Yesterday a meeting of the Suey Dins
was called and it was decided that blood
alone coulA wipe ou the Insult offered by
tho assault. Accordingly a challenge was
eent to the headquarters of the Hop Sing
Tong and was accepted within an hour.
A fever of excitement immediately spread
over Chinatown, especially when It be
came known that messages had been sent
to several dangerous highbinders of
Seattle and Fresno to come to this city
with all possible speed.
Last night the police were very alert,
but few members of either warrine fac

"TELEPHONE GIRL" REVEALS
CENTRAL IN HER FORTRESS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 10.â By far the biggest
success of the week has been the passage
of the ratification of the China Basin
lease by the Senate, and the most inter
esting event of the coming week will be
the consideration of the bill by the As
sembly.
When the bill passed thÂ» Senate/ oppo
sition to It was determined and bitter,
â¢Jid the- prospects of a fierce fight in the-
Assembly were good. Since then, how
ever, matters have taken a better course.
*nd there Is a probability that the tight
will not be so long nor so hard as at first
supposed. It will not be easy, however,
for the line-up against the bill contains
many whose po*:u<.n is not to be swaved
by argument or imiuc-nceu by reason.
They ere just against it. And there are
more who will be against it for. reasons
which obtained In at least one case in
the Senate.
Of all the votes cast for the bill there
was not one so true as that by Green
well of Ventura. He represents Ventura
and Santa Barbara, and the one measure
he Â¦was interested in was a, bill appropri
ating (2B.WU to l>ui'.<i the remainder oi me
road frcm Santa Barbara to Bakersfleld.
For thirty-five years the people of the
pouth have been working lor the road,
#nd the time for the passage of the bill
feeroed propitious, it was passes! by the
Assembly without a dissenting voice, and
caaie to the Senate with every prospect of
coing through without trouble.
That was, until tbe opponents of the
Cblna Basin lease lound thai Grtenwell
wet. goirg to vote for the ratification bill.
Then th.y put the screws on him. He was
toid if he did not vote against the leas*
the gt-ng would line up soildiy against his
bill, which was an Assembly Mil Intro
duced by Merritt. and that efter its easy
passage in the Assembly it would surely
Le beaten in the Senate.
The effect of this would be to make
Oreeawell politically dead, for the road
bill v. as the only thing his eonstituitnt*
riemaaded. It was a hard position, but
Oreenwell was equal to it. he considered
The matter for several days and on the
oay when the vole was taken he came t.i
the supporters of the lease bill and said
tie was going to vote for it â and he did.
The majority for the lease was 'so large,
however, that the opposition lay down,
and Greenwell's road bill has followed the
lease bill through the Senate and by this
time is- probably viith the Governor.
Adjournment is still something of a
problem, although nearly everything
T-oints to next Saturday night. Smith of
Kern, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, deciares there is no reason
why the Legislature cannot adjourn on
Thursday, but the Assembly will never be
Able to get away so early as that. And
yesterdxv there was a. new- report about
It. It was said that there were, a num
ber of bills run through on Friday and
Eaturday v.hich the Governor will not
dare to sis::, dees not wish to veto, and
!Â«= anxious jo s=ee become laws. With only
r.ine days erf the session left, however, he
would be ccmpelle'l to sign them or they
would be killed. Th^ way out proposed is
Injurious and is nothing more than de
laying adjournment i:tit!I Tuesday. tlÂ»e
3?th. which would give ten days for the
Mils to be in the Governor's hands before
the close cf the se?sion. and they would
then become laws by limitation and with
out th<? prominence of a signature. A day
or two will show how well founded is the
report.

of dirt containing three cents and over

would be found lower down. On these
representations stock sold freely and a
large hydraulic plant was put In, with
sawmill and pipeline, and the building of
a flume was well started. It then occurred
to some of the men that It would be well
to continue the Â¦ prospecting. No color
could 'be found, and expert miners who
have since been called In say that the
sand Is valueless. Feeling runs so high

PETALUMA. March 10.â Miss Lena
Scott, a prominent belle of Mendodno
County, whose home is not far from the

long braids from the golden tresses with
which nature bounteously endowed her.
The braids have not disappeared, but they
no longer form a part of Miss Scott's
abundant locks, and Just how they came
to be severed is~ a mystery of which the
residents for miles around are talking.
Last Friday Miss Scott left her housa
and walked to the beach to enjoy a swim.
When she returned she found ~that the
other members of the family were out.
Being somewhat wearied she decided to
rest, and lay on a lounge. She soon fell
asleep and did not awake for about an
hour. As she arose from the lounge she
noted that her hair felt iess burdensome,
and she was then startled to see two Ions
braids lying on the floor. On a table
near by was a - pair of scissors, in the
hinge of which were a few hairs. Some
person had severed the braids while the
girl was Bleeping.
The affair has been Investigated, but It
remains a complete mystery. The young
lady eays she was In no manner disturbed
during her slumber, and she cannot as
sign a reason why any person should deÂ»
Blre to destroy the beauty of her tresses.

j Y~) Y a special bulletin which has just been issued by
! |\ tne Manufacturers" and Producers' Association
*â' there is presented to the public a record of work
! done which clearly attests the value of the organiza-
I tion, not to members only but to the whole State.
j Nor is the bulletin confined to statements of whit
! has been achieved in the past. It announces, the nature
I of tasks now occupying the attention of the associa- 1
j tion and gives a programme for the immediate futurr.
Among the things accomplished are the distribution
j of printed matter on a large scale, the influencing of
j home patronage and State pride in manufactures and
! productions, overcoming in all possible ways discrim
j inations against home products in bids calling lor
I supplies for public institutions, and successfully over
i coming in many instances discrimination against our
i products" in eastbound freight rates. Furthermore, it
; is pointed out that it is largely due to the efforts of
j the association that there were expended iri this city
: by the War Department between $11,000,000 and $12,
000,000 in outfitting troops for the Philippines, and
: that there has been an increase of about $50,000 an
Â¦ iiually in the purchase of supplies in this city by the
Indian Bureau.
In that connection it is noted the association
! promptly met an attack upon California oak-tanned
leather and' secured a cancellation of orders for 75,000
pairs ot shoes of. Eastern leather infavor of Califor
; nia' manufacturers'.' It is added: : '".The association was
mainly instrumental in securing a treaty of commerce
between this country and Ecuador which will be of
great advantage to this State,' especially in the market
it affords for our lumber, preserved. and dried Hails
and wines. .The association has instituted similar
' 5>teps as. to Bolivia,, and has within a few days fur
i nished the State Department with important data on
; the subject."
That is a most' excellent showing for an organize
j tion which dates only fronrMarch. 1895. and it is grat
ifying to note that the energies employed for progress
and improvement arc not in. any way diminishing.
The association is now working for the adoption, of
. pure-food legislation, for the prevention of the import
I into this State of convict-made! goads and for. action
| on the part of the United States Government to pre
vent interference by Russian authorities with Â¦Amcr
; ic.m fkhins craft in Okhotsk Sei.

Roger Q. Mills of Texas, who was once among the
notable statesmen of the day, has not v been sulking
out of a job since he left Congress but has been
exploiting the wealth of his State, and with such

ments $15,000 a month, with bright prospects of an
increase. Evidently there are some tilings in the
United States that are better than a seat in Congress.
one of which Mr. Pillsbury is the most
conspicuous patron, to say nothing of the.
young women graduates^ should strive for
the snread of education with the same
zeal that this man has striven, taking
particularly into account their opportu
nities as compared with his own. the re
sult would be such an extension of learn
ing as the country has never before seen.
Kor, to begin with. Mr. Plllsbury had a
very slender equipmentâ only suah educa
tion ps the course of a school in a small
tewn affordedâ and he has steadfastly set
his face toward the educating of others.
He Is a New Hampshire man, born in the
town of Sutton In July, 1&2S. At an age
when the average boy of to-day Â»s in high
school or college he was learning a trade
and serving as a clerk in* his brothers
store. .
From the start he seemed bent on trade.
H>> made a thorough investigation of the
West and Northwest Just after ths cen
tury had turned its llrst half, bufthe fev
er of the nomad was .not in his volns and.
a(tÂ»r long searching, ho retiched a tiny
hamlet in Minnesota called St. Anthony,
now the city of Minneapolis. He made up
his mind that there was the place to set
tle down.
One day not long ago a gentleman sug
gested ' to Governor Pillabury that he
should pick out a different location for the
spltndtd public library building which he
has decided to give to the east side of
Minneapolisâ a building now under way.
The friend's thought was that for so nnÂ«
a building perhaps it would-be better to
locate it on a more fashionable street and
in a finer part of the town. Butthe reply
was that the site was excellent? It was
rvear one of the high schools of the cit>.
which was an advantage, and was handy
to street cars at a transfer point, but.
above all, it was In the part of the city
where lived a good many of the people
whom he had known when he first came
a time," said Mr. Pillsbury.
"when I asked these people for a few
favors and they granted them and were
always steadfast Jn their friendships; now
I want-to do something for them and,
where the older' ones have passed away,
for their. children... A good many of these
people 'arÂ«s , not living . in . the fashionable
quarters, 'so I am going to put this library
building where ItTwin be handy for them.
Practical Methods as Governor.
I do not know that I can In any way
better Illustrate tht character of this man
than by an incident in his life when he
was Governor of the State. . In 1873-74
grasshoppers devasted many portions of
the West. Mr. Plllsbury was elected Gov
ernor in 1S75. There were many reports
thSt the people were suffering because of
their loss of crops from ..the pest, so th e
Governor-elect, in the late 'Â»"â¢Â¦Â«"Â»
man out to see how the farmers i were
coming on, that he might be prePâ¢
Â»vhen the Legislature assembled and he
wal inaugurated, to make recommenda
tions. If necessary, for aid. The agent re
ported and colored his report against the
December, not yer convinced
that the people were not Buffering. Mr.
Piflsbury: started: out on- a personal trip
unknown to any one. He drove out in the
country .places - through biting w Intrj
w (a th/r, .calling upon the farmer? .from
farm Va farm. He found many*of them In
the most abject need, some -of them with
nothing but potatoes to eat He left money
where that would relieve immediate dis
tress and went home. In a few weeks he
started out In another direction on a simi
lar trip ' Meanwhile the Legislature as-
BC-mbled and sat Governorless-the Gov
ernor-elect did. ndt put in his appearance
on the day of inauguration.
â¢But when he did appear, soon afterward,
he had somethlngto tell them other than
the pretty platitudes .of such an. occasion
âhe told them of the terrible present and
prospective suffering within their own
borders:. The facts- were published, the
Legislature appropriated money, people
contributed focd and clothing by the car
load and the Governor and his -wife per
{â¢cr.ally superintended its distribution.
Xhev fed and ' clothed . during that
wretched season <W0 settlers,' all of whom
were in dire noed.
It was while Mr.. Plllsbury was engaged
in business In 'the little town of St. An
thony, where .he was steadily prospering
as * hnrdware merchant, that he saw the
possibilities of the great water ' power in
the ''Mississippi River, "the . Falls of St.
Anthony.*- Finally, in connection' with his
nephew. Charles A. Pillsbury.. recently
declared.-* the flour milling plant was es
tablished which hns row become famous
i over the world. Tho beginnings were not
i,large.- but little bv little,- the
crew until -now the- company of. which

the precise language, he told the promoter
not only that he would not go Into the
deal from business reasons but that un
der no circumstances would he go into it
from the standpoint of sentimentâ he
would not lend his influence toward form
ing a flour trust.
Building Up a Great University.
His Interest in the IT.,iverslty of Minne
sota began when It was a struggling in
stitution, with a few rtudents and very
little money, but with an unlimited pros
pect for decay and a fine outlook for an
early death. The fact that he had been
denied the opportunities for securing an
education no doubt quickened his inter
est: but greater than this was his desire
that an institution should be bui t up
v.-hlch would serve . as a great source of
power to the State, a reservoir of Intel
lectual influence upon which the futu>e
might draw. He was elected to tho State
Senate. in 1S60 and he bejran at once to
work for the universitv. He was instru
mental In clearing up the Indebtedness on
the institution, puttin? fts financial af
fairs in shape and preserving the valua
ble State lands to which it was entitled.
The university took on new life. He had
not started in to be a friend for a day.
and whien some years later the number of
students had so increased that a new
building was needed he surprised the
members of the Board of Regents and
the legislative committee who had gone
to the last limit in appropriations by tell
ing them that he wanted to give *l.>0.mÂ»
out of his own pocket for the building.
Thus the science hall, or Fillsbury Hal!,
as it Is known, became possible. -;â¢-â¢;
Seeing His Gifts Well Bestowed.
One of the peculiarities of Mr. Pillsbuiy
i3 that which now and then of late years
Is being shown among men of wealthâ
the disposition to give away money un
der his own direction: to see to it himself
that his wealth goes Into the right chan
nels.
Some time ago he thought the little place
where he was born, the town of Sutton,
N H.Â» oueht to have n town hall, so he
pave the money for a handsome building-.
Two or three years ago he joined, with his
wifa to do something for a very worthv
and yet money-needing institution In Min
neapolis, a home for children and a Red
women. So $100,000 was given as a perma
nent endowment fund, placed at a good
rate of Interest, and the Income goes to
the support of the institution. Not long
ago he and his wife thought there ought
to be a home for working girls in Minne
apolis, a place where they could secure
good accommodations at reasonable rates,
where they could be surround'd by whole
some influences; where they could be
helped onward In the. struggle. A line site
was purchased and a .iberal sum of money
set apart for the erection of a handsome
building now nearing completion. The
branch public library building has already
been noted. . . ;., . Â¦ _,
Eleven Maxims for Young Men.
I called on Mr. Pillsbury. one day not
Ion? since and asked him to tell the yountr
men of this nation what success was. In

clear, first of all. that success was not the
mere accumulation of *reat wealth. Then
he gave what might be termed a recipe
for success, and I have put In condensed

THE TRADE SITUATION.
THERE was not much change in the commercial
situation last week. From all quarters of the
country caiae uniformly satisfactory reports,
rod most lines were quoted more or less active. The
b?.r.k clearings showed a gain of 37 per cent over the
same week last year* Baltimore and Minneapolis being
the only important cities to show a falling off. The
gains in the larger cities were 51 per cent in New York,
1 3.8 at Boston, 13.5 at Chicago, 45 at Pittsburg. etc.
The failures were 208. against 205 for the correspond
ing weftl: last year.
The iron trade is attracting attention on account of
its great activity, which is beginning to resemble
lht boom of 1899. The manufacturers report a very
heavy home demand, and bids for future delivery at
current prices are more often turned down than ac
cepted. Curiously enough, there is considerable ex
port business in finished products, in the face of
declining markets.
The usual distributive demand for the spring trade
if being attended to by jobbers and retailers at the
ir.oment, and both report business good. Building
materials, particularly lumber, are in brisk demand,
especially in the East, which is rather curious, for th.-
West has led building operations for many years. This
iv the only line, however, in which the East leads
the rest ofthe country, as far as merchandise is con
cerned.
The staples are irregular. Wheat has been sagging,
as usual, owing to heavy receipts at primary points,
liberal quantities, afloat and good crop prospects.
M^eci'.'.M'.op has fallen to insignificant proportions at
Chicago and New York, and the foreign demand for
American wheat is light. The wool trade is in an un
titisfactory condition and is m.ore or less of a puzzle
to the trade, prices having declined from 70 to 80 per
cent in Europe and fiom 30 to' 40 per cent in the
United States during the past fifteen months, accord
irg to a local authority. Sales have been larger in
this country of late, but the demand for manufactured
*;oods has not beerf a? to purchases of the raw wool.
There have been several large failures in this line
htely, both in New England and Europe. The cotton
trade, too, is lagging, with declining prices for the
raw product. Boots and shoes continue to move oft
well, and most factories report sufficient ordert to
!u ep them running for some little time yet. Provi
sions continue in very fair shape, the light supply of
hops keeping pork products firm.
Wall street is without special feature at the moment.
The formation of the huge steel combine was effected
'.vithout disturbing th-j money market, and, now that
it has become a thing of the pas*, the street has little
or nothing to talk about.
Local 'conditions remain as before stated. Dryer
weather has enabled fruit growers to begin plowing
x'r.tir orchards, and the same clear skies have Riven
an impetus to the growing grain all over the State.
Crop conditions were seldom better than at present,
:!iough there is still pienty of time for frost and north
winds to do damage. Wholesalers and exporters re
port a continued ac'ive demand for most kinds of
1. erchandise. and few if any'of the retailers arc com
plaining. Funds r.rc still in ample supply, and collec
tions are rp to the average in most lines. The ship
1 ;rtK trade of the port is still heavy.
A part of the work of the University of New York
is the publication of an annual summary and synopsis
of State legislation. That for the year iooo, which
has just been made public, shows that during that year
there were thirteen State Legislatures in regular ses
sion and they added to the State statute books an
aggregate of 5772 laws. New York led the list with
776, Maryland was a close second with' 747, while Ohio
came third with 583. It will be seen that the com
plaint to be. made of ou:| Solonsis not that of idleness
but that of pernicious activity.
The trustees of the public library at New'Bruns
wick, New Jersey, voted down a proposal to ask Car
negie for a donation, and in doing so declared a be
lief that the town has enough wealth to support a li
brary without passing the hat. The spirit of the ac
tion is all right, but it remains to be seen , whether
the town will live up to it.
It is worth noting as an illustration of the pervers
ity of this world that while Sampson and Schley ars
still waiting for some sort of promotion for their ser
vices in the victory at Santiago the defeated Spanish
admiral has received high honors from his govern

The New York Temperance Union. has taken, the
strange course of commending Mrs.; Nation but con
demning her hatchet. Had George Washington been,
able to make so nice a discrimination at the time of
the cherry tree affair he would have said: "Father,
I cannot tell a lie; it was the hatchet."
The local Civil Service Commission and the Board
of Public Works are to be congratulated on reaching
a conclusion which everybody else arrived at some
time ago. The two boards are absolutely and em
phatically convinced of the various unworth of one
The fear that the United 'States will .lose more of

The Duke of Manchester has been sued for dam-'

the advice of British officers in the settlement of in

the Abyssinians never heard of the adage that he who

WORLD'S WAR NEWS.
A disquieting rumor Is current In the
Pembroke, dockyard that the armored
cruiser Essex and seven sister shljs, now
in course of construction, are deficient in
stability and will therefore prove failures.
The first attempts at submarine naviga
tion in France date back to ISflO, and did
not Impress the naval authorities a* belns
practicable. Twenty-seven years later Ad
miral Aube, Minister of Marine, took up
the subject again, ami Â«<ince then engi
neers and naval officers have worked at It
I with uninterrupted zeal. There is now no
j doubt that submarine navigation Is practl
â¢ cable, but the difficulty in using the boat*
for the purpose of locating and blowing
up an enemy's vessel lies In the inability
of the steersmap to utilize the periscope
I or reflector under all conditions of
weather. This 13 a problem not yet satis
factorily solved.
!
I The large number of war vessels to be
| launched during the present year will more
than make up for the apparent back
wardness of 1300. In Italy two battle
ships, the Rheina Marguirltta and Bene
detto Erin, will be launched In March
and September. In the United States three
| battleships, two monitors, six protected
j cruisers, thirteen destroyers, six torpedo
' boats and seven submarine boats are duo
! to slide Into the water, while the fleets of
Russia. France and Germany ,wi'.l be in
creased by at least thirty vessels* of all
I classes. In England naval construction ta
! being rapidly pushed, two battleships, the
Montague and Albemarle being launched
I on March 5. after the brief period of i"Tt
I and Cl days on the stock?, while the ar
mored cruiser Drake was launched ln.fe'0
days from the time her keel was laid.
Several battleships and armored cruisers
building under contract will also bÂ»
launched during 1901 and altogether con
siderably over half a million tons will* be
, added to the navies of the world.
An interesting table of the relative fight
ing value of the principal armored ships
appears in the January- number of the
Marine Rundschau. The comparisons are
made by Xr.val Constructor Otto Kretsch
mer of the German navy and appears to
be the best practical method yet sub
mitted to ascertain the military value oi
a war vessel. Mr. Kretschmer takes into
consideration the size, armor, speed, arm
ament and endurance of the several ships,
which elements collectively constitute the
military efficiency. The low standing of
the Maine is an unintentional slur upon a
ship which will undoubtedly rank with
the Formidable, and i3 due to the fact
that the constructor accepted as correct
the data found in the Austrian . naval
hand-book, but which, so far as they ra
late to our new ships and guns, are incor
rect. Followlnff ia the table:
CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN.
__ >^ NE of the last acts of the recent session of Con
. ( I S res s was the passage of a bill providing for
\_^/ the appointment of a. commission to adjudicate
claims of. citizens of the United States against Spain
arising between the outbreak of the Cuban insurrec
tion and the ratification of the treaty of peace at ParK
By the terms of the treaty the United States Govern
ment assumed payment of all such claims, and it is
likely that the total amount, is going to be consider
able', so that'the commission will have a good deal
. i Reports from . Washington are to the effect that
there are now about 260 of these claims against Spain
oiÂ» file at the State Department, aggregating upward
of $38,000,000. It is said, however, that in most cases
the claims are excessive and that in many of them the
claimants will firfd it difficult to prove their American
citizenship. ' Furthermore, even where citizenship is
indisputable and the amount of the claim not excess
ive, the Government will not be required to pay it
unless it be shown that Spain would be liable for the
loss sustained had not the United States assumed the
payment. In other words, our Government occupies
the position of the Spanish Government and is not
liable for war losses except such- as are Justly charge
able to" Spain. \ /
The commission is to consist of five persons, each
of whom is to receive a. salary of. $5000 a year. The
decision of the commission is to be final when the
commissioners v are unanimous, but the bill provides:
''When the commission is in doubt as to any question
of law arising upon the facts in any case before them
they may state the facts and the question of law so
arising and certify the same to the Supreme Court oi
the United States for its decision, and said court shall
have jurisdiction to consider and decide the same."
The commission will have many complex questions
of law and of fact to settle. Where injury was inflicted
or property taken by the Spanish military authorities
in Cuba it is clear tint Spain was responsible, and we
must pay the claim; but it is said that for indirect
losses no damages can be obtained. One authority
estimates that of the whole $38,000,000 of claims pre
sented to the State Department less than $4,000,000
will be recovered. It 15. recalled that under the Amer
ican and Spanish claims agreement of 1871 clainu
amounting to $30,000,000 were presented, but only
$1,300,000 was allowed. The United States and Mex
ican Claims Commission (treaty of 1S6S) allowed iSf)
out of the 1017 claims presented. Of the aggregate of
$35,000,000 of claims presented to the French and
American Claims Commission (convention of 1880)
less than $1,000,000 wns allowed.

amalgamated with a lot of others into a
great Hour trust. The scheme had at
tractive features from a commercial point
of view Mr Plllsbuf y held the key to

presents them for whatever, value they may
hare as communications of general Interest.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE CALL.: *
An editorial in to-day's Call, headed "That
Colonist Rate," compels me.- In Justice to M*r
ced city and county, to request the privilege
of space in your columns In order to obviat*
a possible mlsjud*ment of the quality and fer
tility of the lands around Merced city and in
Merced County. In the editorial referred to
you advise the necessity of seeing- that the new
settlers expected here shall be well located,
and warn against the repetition of an ex
perience made near Merced about ten years
a*o. which Is deplored by all but by Merced
city and county more than by ar.y on* else. At
that time quite a number of Hollanders, cotn-
posed -of a splendid Â»*t of people, mostly
younjr, ' intelligent and educated, and all well
supplied with means, were brought here fnr
colonization. Unfortunately, however, they
were, through "land sharking." as you call It.
located on a section of land not at all suit
able for the purpose intendedâ that Is. orchards
and â¢vineyardsâ and were made to ray for it
more than the very best of land cnuld have
been bought for. and which Is In abundance
here. However, this fart was not alone thÂ«
cause of failure, for, bad as the selection of
the land has been, yet It Is* by no means unpro
ductive, for It possesses a jrreat deal of the fer
tility of the soil surrounding: It. on which the
finest oranges, prunes, apricots, peaches, nÂ«Â«.
nlives, grapes, berries, etc.. *re raised. The
other trouble was that, while tne Hollander col
onists were a good set of people, yet but very
few of them were of the kind requisite to
make colonists for a new settlement, for thÂ»v
were nearly all reared In large cities, arcim
tomed to all the comfrrts of life, and not much
Riven to that drudgery, tedious and hard work
which Is naturally indispensable with tillers
nf the soil, and much more so with new set
tlers. Â¦
I am neither land owner nor land speculator.
I am a dry goods merchant, established here
for many years. I have watched the Holland
colonization scheme from Its inciplency, anl
feel competent to pass an opinion aa to th<Â»
cause of the failure. I therefore venture- thÂ»
assertionâ and many of the colonists them
selves have coincided with meâthat even on
this land the colony would have proved a
success had the riKht class of people been
located on It. In falrce*a to Merced r!ty anl
county- I hope The Call will not object to
glvlnr'space to this corr.munlcation.

COLONY SCHEME
CAME TO FAIL
tries is most encouraging. The great need -of the
State has been for cheap fuel or other power-produc
ing energy. That need is now to be supplied by the
use of oil as fuel and by the extension of electric
power generated by waterfalls. The future is thus full
of promise, and if our manufacturers and producers
can continue to work together for general advantage
through the association there is no reason for any fear
of the outcome. ,yv,; I .
OUT of the Chinese imbroglio there has sud
denly developed a new storm center. It ap
pears that while Germany has been devoting
her attention to making a collection of Chinese heads
to be presented to Kaiser William on a charger, and
the United States, France and Great Britain, along
with Japan, have been figuring out claims for money
damages, Russia, with the manners of a quiet and
unostentatious bear, has gradually taken possession
of Manchuria. The powers,' it is said, have had their
attention directed to what Russia has been doing, and
it is now no longer a question *of head 6f
money gathering but one of inducing the bear to quit
hugging and quit crowding* . : \
Various are the reports that have been "put .into,
circulation concerning the new phase of -the Chines*
problem. According to one story Great 'Britain "has"
taken the lead in protesting against the action of Rus
sia and has sought the aid of the United' States. Ah- ;
other attributes leadership in the protest to Germany.
Some have said the United: States has agreed to op
pose Russia, and some that ho -such agreement has
been made or will be made. [ These various 'reports
are not only interesting but instructive. They make
clear to the public the fact that something is "going
wrong in the concert but that no outsider knows-ex
actly what it is. . * â¢ , â¢. â¢Â¦ â¢
From reports derived frorn sources outside of dip
lomatic channels it appears it is now too late for the
powers to protest against Russian occupation of Man
churia. They might as well protest against, American
occupation of the Philippines or British occupation
of Egypt. The time when a protest might have been
available is past and What is sometimes called
"manifest destiny" and sometimes "divine providence"
has conducted the armies of Russia into that province
of China. They cannot now be -driven out except by
war, and. of course, there will be no war on that issue.
It will be easier for. Germany and Great Britain to
atone for Russia's wrong by following the example
and taking a province or two themselves. ' ?*>vV
The sudden splutter over ttis Manchurian question
is a striking illustration of the close similarity be
tween the movements of diplomacy and the move
ments of a snail. The newspapers of all parts of tru*
civilized world have been publishing notices of the
advance of Russia and her encroachments upon China
ever since the close of the war between* China and
Japan. The movement upon Manchuria has been
noted time and again. British travelers and German
travelers have repeatedly published their observations
iri that part of the world and have kept the reading
public well advised of what was going on. Conse
quently it is somewhat surprising to learn that at this
late day the diplomatists have begun to get disturbed.
Dispatches from Berlin recently announced that a
special correspondent of" the Tageblatt has reported
to that paper that throughout Mongolia Russian flags
are everywhere seen: that Russian generals in their
official orders refer to the country as a part of Russian
territory: and lie adds that Manchuria is also virtually
an integral part of Russia. Some time ago it was an
nounced that the Moscow Gazette had openly advo
cated "the establishment of a permanent Russian ad
ministration" throughout Manchuria, and i?i doing zu
had said: "At present we are merely camping there:
we are forced to incur expense without compensation
and without being able to rescue the inhabitants from
distress and demoralization. Yet the welfare of Man
churia would be a natural consequence of a properly
organized Russian administration, which would ?.t
the same time relieve the treasury from the present
enormous expenditure. The necessity of the permanent
settlement of the Manchurian "question has now be
come urgent We. repeat that the more the Chinese
problem is confused by the intrigues of the Europea.i
powers and of the Imperial Court the more necessary
for us is the speedy solution of the Manchurian ques
tion."
With all those facts before the public there is not
likely to be much excitement over the reports of a
diplomatic disturbance. It is too late to protest
against the virtual annexation of Manchuria to the
Russian Empire. The bear has that province within
his hug, and nothing but a. knife-thrust to the hear:
will ever make him turn loose.

To the old, as to babies, the
even balance oi health is more
important than anything else
iri the world. The possible
health, in age, is not high and
strong; it is qnly even. .
There b no ond, but death,

MISS GRACE WHITNEY, ONE
OF MOST FETED DEBUT
ANTES OF NEW CENTURY.
OMAHA. March 10.â John R. Murphy, a
passenger on Union Pacific ' train No. 3.
shot and killed himself with a 38-caliber
revolver this morning at 3 o'clock in his
sleeping berth in a tourist car near Chap
pel. Nebr. He fired two shots, from the
revolver. The first ball glanced and the
second struck the frontal bone on the
right side and passed Into the brain:
Valuable papers were found in Murphy's
pockets, beside cash amounting to $199 01.
His ticket was purchased in New York
City via the West Shore Railroad, and his
destination was San Francisco. He had
two discharges from the American and
British navies as a first-class machinist.
They show he was on the battleship Ore
gon on its memorable trip around Cape
Horn in 1898, that he participated In the
battle at Santiago, and as a gunner was
discharged in- September, 1S99. He then
enlisted in the British navy, with the
same position, and was recently dis
charged from a cruiser.
Murphy was born at Danville. Canada,
and had a brother at Williams, Ariz. Cor
oner Bassett has taken charge of the
body.
Murphy acted peculiar on the train,
looking about him continually, as though
fearful oC somebody. He was 35 years old
and weighed about 165 pounds. His rela
tives have been communicated with.

gon Kills Himself on
SANTIAGO HERO
DIES A SUICIDE
However, when you come right down
to the evidence in the case, none of us
were overastonlshed. George has -fooled
us on the betrothal proposition just once
George Hall has left for Constantinople,
and a dainty miss Is trying to look un
concerned about it. Everybody had it
that the Turkish Consul and the daric
eyed miss were ready to receive teacups
when lo and behold! George is off for a
seven months' stay In the land where the
Sultan rules.
One need not be a prophet to predict
that the completed Flood mansion Is go
ing, to be one of the handsomest homes
In this city. Work is being rapidly pushed
on the house and it will probably be ready
for occupancy about June. By the time
we all get back from our summer outings
Mrs. Jlmmie will be ready tOjthrow open
her doors and welcome her friends.
The day I watched Jlmmie j and his
baby I also managed to take a few side
glances at the wonderful parasol Mrs.
Jimmle carried. It was of black lace and
all drawn through with baby blue ribbons.
It-had tho Paris stamp all over it. and
was- pretty enough to match the bonnie
face and charming toilet of Its owner.
Jlmmie never, misses a day. out at the
house. Promptly at 3 o'clock .ie appears
upon the scene, goes over the house, in
spects the day's work and looks wl3e.
Sometimes he Is accompanied by his sec
retary. Â¦ who puts In an afternoon of se
rious .inspection, and sometimes he has
the company of his- charming young wife
and baby. Jlmmle trusts to the cars to
bring him to his home that is to be. but
Mrs. Jlmmie for the most part drives up
In a victoria, and while she trips through
the mansion "with her doting . husband
baby stays with the nurse In the carriage.
It Is worth anybody's while to go out on
Broadway of a sunny afternoon and see
Jimmle shake a "day-day" when Mrs.
Jimmle and baby drive oft. I watched him
through the performance the other after
noon and came away in an unhappy, puz
zled condition. I never saw a man go
through so . many cabalistic signs, and
when the baby looked so impressed and
open-eyed, I will 'confess I was curious to
know what the hopping and waving and
grimacing were all about.
IT Is no fun to be "building.". Ask the
Jlmmle Floods If you won't believe
what I say, or if you don' f want to
ask, Just take a good long look at
Jlmmle. Ills alterod appearance Is
more eloquent than any argument I might
offer. Debonair Jlmmle has disappeared
and in his place is a serious looking man,
with whitened temples, ana shoulders that
are beginning to stoop, just a littleâ and it
is all because of the added cares born of
the mansion out on Broadway that is
a-building for him.- .......

But trouble hedges round him once

quarter-of-a-hundred-dollar slice from

TOPEKA, Kans.. March 10.â The initial |
edition of Mrs. Carrie Nation's paper, the j
Smashers' Mail, is interesting. It Is a IC
page paper of nea,t appearance, containing
several half-tone illustrations of various
scenes during the late Joint crusade. Mr.--.
Xation says in her salutatory:
I have no apologies to make for having
Nick Childs for the publisher of the Smashers"
Mall. Our Savior ate with the publicans and
sinners to do them good. The servant is not
above his Lord. This paper will be. as its
name implies, the smashers' mall. I shall put
into the columns the letters I get from all
over, even those I get from across the water.
Those wishing to say anything through the
columns of the Smashers' Mail must put It in
the form of a letter and use brevity â tha soul
of wit â for I reserve the exclusive right as
editor. I have had a severe lesson In Peorla
from allowing Eome one to attend to what I
ought to, therefore, I alone am responsible for
what goes in. . _
On the fourteenth page Is found the pic
ture Of the negTO. Jack Chllds. the pub
lisher. Underneath are these lines:
"Business manager of the Smashers'
Mail and the plain dealer who went to> the
relie' of Mrs. Nation when deserted by the
law and order people."
â¢ The first page contains an excellent
half-tone of Mrs. Nation. The depart
ments under which the letters are pub
lished In the Smashers' Mail are: "Letters
From Hell," "Letters From Honest Peo
ple," "Appeals for Help," "Some Poetry,"
"Notes and Comments." "Indorsements
and Iavltations." "Snap Shots" and "An
swers 'to Correspondents." Some of the
paragraphs are:
We solicit advertisements of all that Is use
ful and beautiful, and that Its use will be tha
clory of Cod.
Why didn't the legislature pass a law pro
hibiting prisoners the use of tobacco, whisky,
or to play cards In Jail? Why build again the

pending an announcement of the budget

Such few dealings which were reported
indicate a most favorable tone, but the
dearncss of money prevents any recovery.
In investment securities .there lias been

Bank stock was firm, mostly rising sev
eral points. Lloyd's shares weakened upon
the announcement regarding capital. The
local market for industries was dull and
weak, numerous pessimistic reports from
the iron Industry appearing and prices
continuing to fall.
English pigiron on the Dusseldorf
Bourse' fell 5 marks, and It is arriving In
Increased quantities. The arrival of Eng
lish coal caused a weakening in .coal
shares. , Iron shares â¢ were further de
pressed yesterday upon a reported quarrel
in the pigiron syndicate.
Efforts have been resumed for the reor
ganization of the rolling mills syndicate
and the sheet mills syndicate, which will
hold a conference March 16. Representa
tives of the mills were In conference at
Berlin yesterday, and the organization of
a syndicate is expected.
Notwithstanding the unfavorable indus
trial reports published last week traders
generally express confidence in the busi
ness situation and declare that the pres
ent pessimism i3 exaggerated. â¢
The demand for money during the week
was considerable, and the private rate of
discount, which had receded to ZVa per
cent, rose one-uighth yesterday. Foreign
exchange moved in- Germany's favor. The
united Mannheim banks took the new
Mannheim 4 per cent loan at 100.30. -
" The Constantinople correspondent of the
Frankfurter Zc-itung says the charter of
the Anatolian Hallway Company has been
renewed for several years. Â¦
There was a lively speculation in Trans
vaals owing to the reported negotiations
between Lord Kitchener and General
Botha.
Among foreign rentes Turkish, Portu
guese and Mexicans were sold for. realiza
tion. Australians and Argentines were in
good demand. Among railroad securities
only the Canadians attracted bidders.
BERLIN, March 10.â The activity of the
Bourse last week was again confined to a
few specialties. Apart from these the
Bourse was inactive. Quotations for im
perial and Prussian loans showed very
slight changes. Nevertheless all 4 per cent
loans Â¦were firm upon a good demand from.'
the public. ~ The leading feature of the
week was the number of municipal loans
announced for early subscription.

pie having business on the steamers of the
Pacific Mall, Occidental : and Oriental,
Oceanic and Pacific Coast lines and the
transport service to board the vessels at
will as soon as the declarations have been
taken. Tailors who renovated the clothes
of the members of the crew, laundrymen,.
chronometer men. dealers In soap, neck
wear, collars, underwear and other small
articles used to come and go at will. Go-
Ing aboard no notice was taken of them,
but on coming ashore they were always
searched, to make sure that there was no
smuggling. This has all been changed
now. Surveyor of the Port Spear has
taken the control of the steamers out of
the hands of the owners and . has issued
an order to all guarding officers to allow
no one not an officer or member of the
crew aboard the various steamers without
an order. In consequence the butcher, the
baker, the candlestick maker and every
body else having business on the Mail
steamers and transports are up In arms,
and a petition Is to be sent to the Col
lector of the Port to have the order re
scinded.
Sailors Are Very Scarce.
Boarding-house masters say there is not
a sailor "on the beach" and that an offer
of 560 "blood money" for each A. B.
"signed on" would not procure a crew. In
a week. Members of the Sailors' Union
claim that if the captains of British ships
now looking for men would pay coasting
wages the union might supply them, but
there is a considerable difference between
the $20 a month paid to deep water sailors
and the ?40 a month paid on coasliiis ves
sels.
The British ships Celtlcburn nnd Lon!
Cairns and the bark Auldglrth are air In
the stream awaiting crews', .and the blc
ship Dition wil join them to-oay. I'la
last man left in. the boarding-houses was
put on the Matterhorn last Thursday in
order to give her a full complement.
What makes the situation still worse-is
the fact that the whalers and cannery
fleet are now fitting out. and thousands
of men will go ' north on those vessels.
Every one of the two fleets will take a
certain number of sailors, who are paid a
certain sum for the round trip and have
the privilege of fishing while their vessels
are laid up in Bristol Bay. In this way
some of the thrifty men make enough
during the season to keep them In comfort
during theÂ« remainder of the year. This
exodus will keep the supply of A. B.'s at
a very low ebb for months to come, and
some of the 1 grain fleet may have to lie
for weeks In port before getting a crew.

J. Dowllng's young hound Sir Lawrence
won .first prize In the 120-dog open stak'J
yesterday at Union Park, taking the de
ciding course by a single point from the
Pasha Kennels' imported Fiery Face.
Fiery Face was about due to annex a
stake, and gave a clever performance
throughout. Luck, however, was against
her to the last, and by scoring the . kill
Just too soon she put herself away from
first coin. Sir Lawrence was more friend
ly with the fickle goddess, and, while o.e
did his work well, was fortunate in get
ting short courses. When the pair we-'t
to the slips In the final Sir Lawrence ha;l
done 91 seconds of coursing, while h's
clever opponent had put in just twice
that time in chasing the game. In tha
semi-final the runner-up had to go thron
times with' the great Beacon before she
could get a decision from him.
Despite the heavy rain a large crowd r.f
peonle watched the dogs chase through
the mud. Pikers made a good day of
It. dropping In for some nice pickings m
the second round.
Fiery Face and St. Ives furnished ex
citement for the crowd by putting up the
cleverest and longest race of the day. It
was a guess until the flag was raised and
St. Ives finally succumbed with the score
at 16 tn 10.
Floodgate again demonstrated that he
cannot be depended upon. He beat Sac
ramento Boy In the second by a score of
3 to 2, and In the next round, when his
chances were figured good enough to be
made a 3 to 1 favorite over Sir Law
rence, he pulled out, hesitated, and
burned his backers' money, losing the
flag by a score of 4 to 6. Chicago Boy
made a good Bhowing all through tho
stake until he met the runner-up in thÂ«
fifth and failed to score. Little Sister
and Rural Artist were among the best >n
the running. Beacon, with his great
speed, should have made a better show
ing. His contests with Fiery Face show
ed her to advantage, the Pasha Kennels'
traveler more than offsetting the blue
dog's fast run up by her clean cut and
meritorious point getting. Fiery Face's
day's work proved her the best dog In
the stake.
Old Connemara beat Gold Ore handily In
the second, and then allowed Brutus to
make an undecided of a course which
certainly belonged to the ancient course.'.
In the run-off Brutus shut him out.
Wedgewod went to his kennel for keep--*
after his first run. Against War Eagle
he was made a 3 to 1 favorite, but could
not deliver the goods, losing a short one,
score 2 to 0. Tom Hurllck took the flag
from Lady Clare at the good price of Â«
to 1, and then lost by a single point to
Fiery Face, though his good showing in
this was by favor.

STORY OF SEABOARD AIR
LUXE PURCHASE TJNTRUE
NEW YORK. March 10.â John G. Lyman
to-night sent out a statement explaining
in detail hia connection with the Interna
tional Zinc Company, owning mines at
Joplln. Mo., which recently passed into
the hands of a receiver. Mr. Lyman, after
reviewing the formation of the firm of
Joshua Brown & Co., said that the wind
ing up of the affairs of Joshua Brown &
Co and the closing of their office
last December was fiirectly due to their
own heavy investments in the Bhares of
the International Zinc Company and
losses in connection with the same. He
claims that the reported earnings of the
mires were carefully examined by a firm
of chartered accountants and certified as
correct He also asserts that every dol
lar which should have gone to the Inter
national Zinc Company was paid to it.
In conclusion, he cites the fact that when
the comnany was brought out zinc sold
at a price yielding $10 per ton profit,
whereas It now barely yields $2. a decline
so serious that none but the most favored
companies have been able to survive.

SOUNDS WARNING
RAILROAD LAND
PATENT SUITS
Conditions Eojulating tha
Grants and Causes of
Premfc Actions.
Brief Sketch of the Acts Referring to
the Eights of Various Claim
ants to Sections in
Dispute.
The suits brought by the United State*
to cancel railroad land patents are ai
present creating considerable interest, es
pecially in California. The first day of
this month was the last day on which
these suits could be filed.
The land grants made by Congress tÂ«
aid in constructing the Western rallroacs
are of such alternate sections of land. n..r.
mineral In character, lying within twenty
miles on each side of the contemplated
road?, as are found not to have been
theretofore granted, sold, reserved or
otherwise disposed of by the United States
at the date the railroad, in aid of which
they are granted, becomes finally located.
The Land Department of the United
States, consisting of the Secretary of th^
Interior, Commissioner of the General
Land Office and the local Registers and
Receivers, is charged with the duty of
ascertaining and adjudging, in advance of
the issue of patents, what lands, within
the prescribed limits, were granted by
Congress to the railroad companies and
what lands are excepted from such grant*
because of mineral character or other
causes: so that when issued and sub
scribed by the President, United Stated
land patents are deemed conclusive evi
dence of title.
As to Timp Limitations.
It Is of great Importance, of course, that
land patents should be attended by the
presumption that all antecedent prere
quisites to their Issuance had been con
formed to, and that they had been law
fully issued; for. otherwise, land title*
would remain Insecure and forever sub
ject to discredit and Impeachment. For
these reasons the courts have recognlaed
land patents as, and declared them to be.
the highest muniments of title, unim
peachable except by suit of the United
States for fraud in their procurement,
mistake or Inadvertence in their issue.
By an act passed on March 3. 1SS7. Con
gress directed the Secretary of the Inte
rior to adjust all railroad land prantj
with reasonable dispatch, and whenever,
in such adjustment, patents were found to
have been erroneously issued, to cause
suits to be brought for the concellatloa
thereof. On March 2, 1S31. Congress
passed another act. providing that aulu
to cancel patents theretofore issued must
be brought within five years after the
date of the act. and on March 2. 1S96, these
provisions were so extended by Congres
sional enactment that suits to cancel pat
ents theretofore issued were required to
be brought prior to March 2. 1901. and
suits to cancel patents issued subsequent
to March 2. 1S36. were required to be
brought within six years after dates of
patents. Prior to these enactments there
was no limitation of time within whlen
the United States was* required to bring
8 On the first day of this month, it beinÂ»
the last day for the nlinp of such suits,
the following suits were brought in the
Circuit courts of the United States for
the cancellation of such railroad land
patents issued prior to March 2. 1SS6. as,
jn the opinion of the Secretary of the In
terior, had been unlawfully issued:
Suits to Cancel Patents.
In the Circuit Court at Los Angles
suits were brought for the cancellation of
several patents issued to the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, conveying in
all about 1000 acres of land claimed by the
United States to have been excepted from
the railroad grant because "reserved"
pending: settlement of the Jupura Mexican
grant boundaries at the date the railroad
grant was made, which Mexican grant
was subsequently rejected as to the lands
in suit. . 'Â¦'
Lands "reserved" for any purpose at the
date of the railroad grant are by the ex
press terms of the granting act excepted
from the lands granted: but the railroad
company claims that while these lands
were within the limits of a certain, fraud
ulent map of the Jurupa, they at no time
were within the true or claimed Ilmlt3
thereof; hetfce they were never "re
served".' for settlement of the Jurupa.
boundaries under proper construction of
the exception "reserved."
In the Circuit Court at San Francisco
two suit3* were brought. On4 of these
suits Is to cancel a patent issued to the
Central Pacific Railroad Company for 8S0
acres of land In Butte County. The bill
of complaint alleges that at the date the
patent issued and since a quartz ledgo
extended through the patented lands con
taining gold in paying quantities; which
quartz ledge, with three hundred feet sur
face ground on each side, was covered by
mining locations and was being actually
mined to profit at the date the patent
complained of was Issued. The other suit
Is to cancel a patent for eighty acres of
land also In Bntte County. This land was
covered by a pre-emption filing at thtt
date the railroad grant was made, and on
behalf of the United States It is claimed
that the pre-emption filing lawfully ex
cepted the land from the railroad grant.
and that in Issuing the patent the land
officers inadvertently overlooked the
filing.
Other Suits in Oregon.
In the Circuit Court for Oregon four
suits were brought to cancel patents Is
sued to the Oreeon and California Rail
road Company for about 2000 acres la all.
Two of these suits are to cancel patents
for lands within limits of the grant as
first established, but outside- thÂ« grant
limits as finally adjusted. The other suits
are for cancellation of patents Issued to
the company for lands within Its trrant.
but covered by pre-emption, homestead
or donation claim fllines. of record at the
date the railroad land prant was made.
These last, mentioned patents were issued
under the rule obtaining at the time that
such filings, although of record when the
prant was made, If canceled at the time
of final location of the railroad, did not
except the lands from the railroad rrant.
but the United States Supreme Court has
recently held otherwise.

mill on Brannan street, between Fourt'i
and Fifth, James Middleton and Patrick
J. Kelly, two boilermakers, were terri
bly burned about the hands and head,
while Gus- Edmonds, the mill engineer.
was scorched about the face.
While the mill was closed down on Sun
day the three men were endeavoring to
repair the boiler, and were using the gas
oline machine to heat the under part of
It preparatory to welding on a patch. Ed
monds was superintending the work, and
all three were gathered close about the
machine, when the gas in the reservoir be
came ignited and exploded with great
violence. The three mechanics were
hurled back and for a moment blinded by
the force of the shock. Mlddleton and
Kelly, who were the most severely in
jured, were hurried at once to the Harbor
Hospital, where their Injuries were at
tended to by Drs. Thrasher and Murphy
They suffered intense pain. Although the
heads of both were badly burned near the
eyes, their sight was not Injured. As soon
as their injuries were dressed they were
removed to their homesâ Kelly to 521^
Howard street, and Mlddleton to Fruit
vale. Edmonds, who was not so badly
burned, was taken at once to his home
at 4063 Nineteenth street.
It is not known positively what caused
the gasoline machine to explode. It is
believed that the reservoir sprang aleak,
the escaping gas caught fire and the flame
was thus communicated to the main body

THREE MEN HURT
IN AN EXPLOSION
The bill of Assemblyman Henry, which
received the Governor's signature Friday,
restricting the hours of service of police
men to eight hours daily, is not considered
seriously by the commission. For one
thing It Is held to be unconstitutional by
that body, as it was decided by the Su
preme Court in the case of Max Popper
against the city In connection with the bill
passed by the Legislature two years ago,
increasing the pay of captains and detec
tives in thp Police Department, that such
a bill was unconstitutional, as it dealt
with a purely municipal affair.
Chief Sullivan said yesterday that the
Police Commissioners and himself had
been trying for some time before the
Henry bill was introduced Into the Legis
lature to decide upon, the best means of
meeting the provisions of the charter that
all employes of the city should not serve
more than eight hours daily. . "According:
to the charter," said the Chief. Vwe should
have one police officer for every 500 in
habitants. That would give us in accord
ance with the last census 684 officers. It Is
plainly indicated in the charter that pa
trolmen is meant, as the instrument dis
tinctly says, 'each police officer at J1200
per annum,' so that corporals, sergeants,
lieutenants and captains are not included
in the enumeration. We have at present
505 partolmen, so that we are actually en
titled to 179 more. If we were allowed the
additional number of 179 men we could in
stitute the now order of things in accord
ance with the charter by making each
man serve only eight hours daily., al
though we would have none to spare. \
"Nothing can be done till the Board of
Supervisors acts. I have, us has already
been said, no power to make thÂ«Â» Increase
and I am entirely in the hands of - the
Board of Supervisors. "We had intended
submitting the matter to the board before
the close of the fiscal year, so that the ad
ditional expe-dlture could be incorporated
in the next year's estimates."
It Is Unconstitutional- Ac
cording to Siprsme
Court Decision.
HENRY BILL NOT
TAKEN SERIOUSLY
Police Officer J. W. Scott, one of the
new appointees to the force, is congratu
lating himself that be is not occupying o
slab in the Morgue. Late Saturday nltfht
he boarded a Clay-street car e.t the corner
of Kearny in response to the cries of the
conductor and found the latter surrounded
by a half dozen soldiers, who were aim
ing blows at his head. Scott attempted
to place the soldiers under arrest and
they attacked him. One of them seized
him by the throat and would have stran
gled him excepting for the conductor,
who, realizing that the officer was "up
against it." as he expressed it. blew nis
police whistle.
Fortunately for Scott, Lieutenant Bird
sail and several of his men were passing
at the time, and seeing the struggle in the
car they lost no time in going- to their
fellow-officer's assistance. The soldiers,
seeing them boarding the vehicle, hastily
alighted and made their escape, with the
exception of one, who grave his name as
David Roy. He vigorously resisted arrsst
and it was not until he was roughly han
dled that he consented to accompany his
captors to the City Prison, where he waa
charped with drunkenness and disturb
ing the peace.
Last night one of the officers from the
Presidio visited police headquarters ani
obtained statements from Scott and the
officers who went to his rescue. It is the
intention of the military authorities to
make an example of the men. thus hoping
to avoid similar occurrences in tho future.
The conductor Is satisfied that if it had
not been for the prompt response of Scott
and the other officers he and the former
would have been seriously Injured If not
made subjects for the Coroner. Scott's
throat is considerably bruised. He was
almost choked to death.

SOLDIERS ATTACK
POLICE OFFICER
PtflLIP H. REMILLARD. OF OAK
LAND, VICTIM OF A PECULIAR
ACCIDENT.
PHILIP H. MEMILLARD. vice
president of Ihe Remillard Brick
Company, wfio fell through the
fire-escape in front of the Del
monico restaurant early yester
day morning, was not as seriously injured
as at first reported. While the Injuries he
received will confine him to bed for some
days, the physicians attending him say
they have 'no fear for his ultimate recov
ery. When he was first taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital he was suffering from
nervous shock. He soon recovered, how
ever, and three hours later was sufficient
ly improved to be removed by friends to
the Waldeck Sanatorium. Remillard. who
is prominent in business, social and po
litical circles, has a host of friends, and
many of them called at the. sanatorium
yesterday afternoon " to visit him. They
were refused admission to his room, as
the physicians deemed it advisable to
keep him quiet for several days. No onÂ©
â¢was admitted to the room but his mother
and other members of the family. .
It was at first feared that Remillard had
sustained a. fracture of the base of the
skull, but there was nothing yesterday to
Indicate that such was the case. Despite
the injuries to his head and face he was
able to talk, but the hospital attendants
urged him to remain quiet. 'Â¦
Remillard is a heavy man. and the fact
that he escaped instant death creates sur
prise. When he opened the window of the
room on the second floor of the restau
rant, where he had been dining with a
party of friends, he stepped out on
what he thought in the darkness to be a
balcony. The next instant he disappeared
from view and struck with'a crash on the
stone, sidewalk below. He had not no
ticed that in the center of the fire-escape
he took to bee a balcony was a large
opening to permit of the firemen raising a
ladder and reaching tbe second floor In
the event of there being a fire in the
building.
His Friends Remove Him to Waldeck Sanatorium and
Physicians Say He Will Recover.
President Chartrey in Defending His
Regime Is Hooted and Several
Speakers Indulge in
Personalities.
A elgr.al victory was won yesterday by
the ar.ti-Chartrey faction at the annual
meeting of the members of the Frencn
Mutual Benevolent Society, held in Na
tive Sons' Hall.
During the four hours which the rneet
lr.g lasted, it had all the characteristics
of a session of the Chamber of Deputies
Of France. The spectacle of a few hun
dred persons, all trying to talk at the
same time, was a unique one and Chair
man P. A. Bergerct used up his physical
etrer-gth in wieldinc a bell to call the
members to order.
President R. Chartrey was on hand with
his followers, but that eiement of the so
ciety was routed horse, foot and artillery-
Judging by the sentiment expressed at
yesterday's meeting. Chartrey and his
staff will so down to defeat at the an
nual election of officers to be held on Sun
day. March 24.
Personalities -were frequently indulged
in and Chartrey rushed to the platform
many times to beseech the chairman to
apply the "closure."
Representatives of tne press were
obliged to identify themselves to Chart
rey's satisfaction ere they were admitted
to the meeting. In calling the gathering
to order, Chartrey accused his opponents
of having given malicious information to
the newspapers and said that the stories
as to scandals in the French Hospital had
no foundation. The president was lis
tened to with attention and everything
was orderly during the election of a
chairman, secretary and vice chairman.
P. A. Bergerot was elected to the chair.
Jules Godeau was made vice chairman
and L. Carrerene was appointed secretary.
These gentlemen all belong to the anti-
Chartrey faction and their election was
looked upon as a. blow at the superinten
dent. The president's report was read by
the secretary and it was frequently inter
rupted with loud laughter and jeers. Lou I
cries greeted his short comment on the
Bosquct-Han.ivan affair, and also his
suggestion that the nurses at the hospital
be allowed some harmless recreations.
The members were impelled to laughter by
the recollection of how Miss Hanavan
charged Superintendent Bosquet with
forcing his attentions upon her and the
recent bal musque given by the nurses
Â¦while off duty.
When Chairman Bergerot asked for
written suggestions as to changes in the
administration uf the hospital, he was
deluged with papers from all parts of the
hall. Julian Bcr^erot read a paper in
which the present administration came in
for severe" criticism. "He suggested tlw
abolishment of The nurses' training school
and the employment of graduate nurses
in the hoppjtaJ. The speaker also favored
ending the of "paying" patients
and urg-ed thct only members should be
treated in the hospital. Mr. Bergerot pre
sented elaborate figures to show that the
system of "paying" patients was unprofit
able.
When it came to a discussion of the va
rious sugRestions made in writing, con
siderable feeling was shown on both sides
of the hall. Chartrey was accused of be
ing a party to wasteful extravagance and
an in^ian'.<? was cited where officers of
a French warship had been lavishly ban-
qucted at the hospital at the expense of
the society and on the same day a patient
had been refused an egg on the ground
that "eggs were expensive."
Laxity in the management of the hos
pital was also charged and each time that
Chartrey interrupted the speakers he was
hooted down. A lonff discussion was held
as to abolishing the training school for
riursps and much feeling was expressed
by the speaker?. The conduct of the doc
tors was also reviewed and many speakers
took a "whack" at President Chartrey.
That gentleman objected constantly to
"personalities," and appealed to the chair
for protection. When he was accused of
having used his position to secure free
treatment for some people, in order to
drum up votes. Chartrey- Was wild with
passion and made a vehement address,
which, however, only rliclted laughter.
For four hours the debate waxed hot and
the Chartrey faction went down to defeat
on each subject. The ciimax came when
cne speaker not only accused Chartrey of
drumming up votes in an illegal way but
also said that he was not a patriotic
Frenchman, because he had worked his
employes on July 11. Â¦ This statement
caused a rumpus.
Chairman Bergerot had the greatest dif
ficulty in restoring order and insisted that
personalities be avoided by the speakers.
Chartrey. in passionate voice, demanded
to know why every one was attacking him
for alleged misconduct in the hospital
management. He insisted that if anything
Â¦was wrone the directors should be held
responsible as a body.
"Why is it." he asked, "that all over
the French colony I hear the cry. 'a bas
Chartrey'?" But the members present
only jeered and laughed the more.
The meeting finally ended -with the elec
tion of the following officers of election:
A. Nuqueu, president: H. Fabre, secre
tary: I. LaEselle. A. Duclos. judges; F.
Cames. J. Tisne. E. BlarQuire, R. Aguirre.

FRENCH HOSPITAL
MEMBERS MEET
The wife of Charles Ure. who wasjfe
cently committed to the Napa Ins*ne
Asylum, last night visited police head
quarters and endeavored to ascertain
what had become of her husband's bank
book and other articles which he had with
him when he came to this city. Ure, who
has been married only a few years, left
his home in Santa Rosa last Monday and
came to this city, after writing an affec
tionate letter to his wife, who was then
in the southern part of the State visiting
friends, informing her that he was about
to visit San Francisco and would return
home in a few days. After arriving here
the unfortunate man Â¦was found by a. po
liceman acting strangely at Sixteenth and
Mission streets, and as he exhibited symp
toms of insanity he was taken to the City
Prison and af teward to the detention ward
of the Receiving Hospital. When arrested
he had $16 in his pockets and a cheap
knife. The following day. he was exam
ined by the Commissioners of Lunacy and,
as it was apparent that he Â¦was suffering
from mental decay, he was committed to
the Napa Insane Asylum.
Saturday night Mrs. Ure, not knowing
what had become of her husband, and
fearing that he had met with foul play,
lost no time in coming to the city. After
arriving here she at once went to police
headquarters and inquired about her hus
band. She was surprised to learn that he
had been committed to an insane asylum,
as she had never discovered that his mind
was deranged.
Mrs. Ure cannot account for the disap
pearance of her husband's bankbook. She
thinks it may have been stolen from him.
Detective Anthony has been detailed to
llnd the book.
The Wife of an Insane Man
-Thinks That He Was
Robbed.
"I have received assurances from a
great many members In both houses that
they will stand by California In its effort
to have the Chinese exclusion act passed,
and I have no doubt that it will become a
law at the beginning of the next session
of Congress." â¢ -
These words were uttered by Congress
.man Julius S. Kahn, who returned from
Washington. D. C., yesterday. Mr. Kahn
was accompanied by Congressman "Wil
liam Elliott of Ueaufort, South Carolina,
who has represented the Charleston dis
trict during the last fourteen years. Mr.
Elliott and his wife have come to this
coast to meet their son, who is an om
cer in the marine corps in Manila and
who has been invalided home. The son
is expected to arrive on the transport
Beaufort, which is due shortly.
Congressman Elliott is a leader on the
Democratic side of the House of Repre
sentatives and is a member of the Ju
diciary Committee of that body. He is
one of the oldest members in Congress and
is universally respected.
"Such men as Senators Foraker and
Lodge." continued Kahn in discussing the
restriction act, "have given me positive
assurances that they will support the
measure. I will make a strong effort to
fix the period of restriction at twenty
years. The bill will surely become a law,
though that period may have to be some
what reduced.
"I was glad to see that the Senate ad-:
Journed without taking action on the
reciprocity treaties. The California dele
gation made a gallant fight to prevent
their ratification, which would have irre
trievably ruined the citrus and dried
fruit industry of this State. The resigna
tion of John A. Casson as Commissioner
Plenipotentiary of the United States, hav
ing in charge the negotiations, is slgnn
cant. It is safe to conclude that the Gov
ernment will make no further efforts to
negotiate reciprocity treaties.
"The failure of Congress to pass the
transpacific cable, Nicaragua Canal and
the river and harbor appropriation bills
is to be deplored. I believe, however, that
a sentiment in favor of the measures has
been created which will help them mate
rially next session. At least forty mem
bers of Congress will come here next sum
mer and by their presence we will be en
abled to show the necessity for great pub
lic improvements. Among those who will
come are the members of the River and
Harbor and Naval committees. Inside of
two weeks we will have Congressmen
Packer. Polk. Dalzell and Gordon of Penn
