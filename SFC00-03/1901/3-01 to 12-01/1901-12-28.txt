LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2T.â A wind storm
cf unusual force and destructiveness has
raged to-day all over the southern part
of California. The storm is what is lo
cally known as a "Santa Ana" and car
ries with it fine dust from the desert
to the east, that fills the air and obscures
ihe vision at distances more than a few
hundred yards.
Reports from surrounding towns say
much damage was wrought by the wind
to oranges and some damage to small
buildings. Railroad traffic !s delayed and
In some instances entirely obstructed.
The storm Is heaviest in the vicinity of
Santa Ana, Col ton and Pomona, between
v.-hich places three passenger trains on
the main line of the Southern Pacific are
Flailed, owing to sand piling upon the
tracic to the depth of two feet in places
and resisting all efforts to keep the tracks
clear.

Cclton seems to have been the very

reached its height at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and gradually subsided after
that hour.
The Southern Pacific Company has
been the greatest sufferer in the matter

been impossible to move a wheel. The

but while greatly delayed has managed
to keep its trains moving.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET.
N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.â
President Castro seems to have
succeeded in defeating the revo-
t lutlonists Jn Venezuela and is
preparing to resist the seizure by
Germany of a Venezuelan port. Offi
cial advices concerning his victo
ries have been received by the
State Department from Minister Bow
en at Caracas. Early last week it
looked as though the revolution would
overthrow Castro's Government, but he
sent troops, which are apparently devoted
to him, to attack the command of Gen
eral Medoza, chief of the rebels, and they
have inflicted defeats in several contacts.
Reports were recently published from
Berlin announcing that before carrying
out her programme Germany would await
the result of the revolution. This was
contrary to the belief of the administra
tion, which expected a demonstration to
occur irrespective of internal conditions
prevailing in the republic. In view of the
-gathering of German warships near Ven
ezuela the authorities say that a move
ment upon one of the ports of that coun
try may be expected at any moment.
General Blockade Not Likely.
The report that a blockade of all ports
will be instituted is considered ridiculous,
because Germany has only four warships
in the Caribbean Sea and the most they
could do would be to occupy and hold one
port. Even this occupation probably
would be difficult
General Castro has made it clear that
he proposes to resist foreign Invasion of
his territory! and as he has an army of
15,000 men he will be able to make it lively
for the Germans.
Another reason why It is not believed
that Germany contemplates the establish
ing of a blockade is that she proposes to

BOGOTA, Dec. 27.â The Government
troops have gained an Important
victory at Honda, which is about
fifty-five miles from here, over the
revolutionary forces under General Marin.
The loss of life was- heavy. According to
the latest accounts 400 men were killed.
General Marin attacked the garrison at
Honda at 6 o'clock in the morning and the
fighting lasted until midnight. There were
about BOO men in the garrison and the at
tacking force consisted of 1200 f.Mdiers.
After the battle had continued for two

into Venezuela and a blockade would have

Embassador von Hollenberg ,has made it
plain to the Secretary that his Govern
ment will occupy a Venezuelan port only
so long as is absolutely necessary to col
lect the claims due its subjects.
Castro Looks for Sympathy.
There appears to be much reliance on
the part of Venezuela in the sentiment
and sympathy which can be aroused
within the United States when a Euro
pean invader is actually operating on
American soil and Venezuela Issues a
declaration of war. Venezuela,, it Is-un

Terrible Deaths.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 27.â Disaster
by flood, the most extensive on the lower
mainland since the Fraser overwashed
its banks in 1804, to-day followed the
storm of "Wednesday night. The. can
neries and buildings and farms at the
mouth of the north arm of the Fraser
River are the greatest sufferers and tho
damage will aggregate nearly $1,000,000. â¢
High tides and freshets from heavy
rains combined to cause the trouble.
Lullu Island and Sea Island, containing
the town of Steveston and the village of
Kburne, with 20,000 acres of highly culti
vated farms, were buried to-day under
four feet of water. Three canneries were
destroyed, many others damaged and
miles of dykes were swept out.
Out in the muddy waters of the gulf
there are thousands of dollars' worth of
salmon cases floating around, tossed idly
to and fro by the waves that still keep
green the memory of the storm of the
day before. At the north arm of the
Fraser the river all day yesterday and
again this morning was the wildest ever
seen by the oldest residents of that vicin
ity. All along there are piles of wreck
age. ,
Big Canneries Are Lost.
The Alliance cannery, the North Arm
cannery and the Labrador cannery at or
near Terra Nova were wholly destroyed.
The canneries mentioned were wrecked
by being battered with trees and by the
high tide which aided in moving them
from their foundations. Portions of the
salmon pack were still in the buildlng3.
left over from the fish'lng season. Some
of the canned salmon is piled up over in
the fields, where there is from two to
| four leet of water, while many cases
have floated out to sea and are being
washed by the waters of the gulf.
The most exciting scenes occurred In
the demolishing of Japanese boarding 1
houses standing on piling near the can
neries. Many of the Japanese would have
been caught like rats in a trap had they
not been assisted out by the white peo
ple in the neighborhood and by other can
nery employes. One Japanese boarding
house containing nine men floated away
and for some time it was impossible to
reach the occupants, but finally two boat3
were manned by volunteers, who realized
perfectly that they were taking their lives
In their hands in endeavoring to rescue
these fishermen. The latter were taken
off the roof of the floating house and
brought to shore, or rather to the place
where the shore used to be.
Logs Storm Buildings.
The Labrador cannery was the first to
be wrecked. Logs four feet thick which
dashed against the building were also
carried Inside the dyke and leveled the
embankment on the way. Nearly all the
cannery boats were smashed and put out
where dry land will appear when the tide
goes out again.
The Alliance and North Arm canneries
had not a possible chance to survive the
storm and were quickly demolished. At
the Vancouver cannery, near by, ninety
fishing boats, valued at S10O each, were
washed up in a field half a mile away
from the river and practically battered
to pieces. One case or salmon was thrown
twenty feet along a dyke, where the next
wave caught it and flung it fifty feet
higher into a tree^ where it still rests.
At the Richmond cannery the cnglne
house and smaller buildings were
wrecked. Here, as well as in other can
neries, the water came in over the can
r.ery floor and damaged the pack.
The town of Steveston was still under
water to-day. Along the north arm and
around the island to Steveston. a distance
totaling thirty miles, there is not a htin
i dred yards of continuous dyke remain- .
ing. Farmers moved their families Into
the second stories of houses and went to
barns, in boats. Loss to small stock will
be large.
Watchman Bravely Escapes.
On the Steveston side the Cleeve tan
ning Company's fishing station, with
buildings and scows at the sand heads,
were carried away and not a single pile
of . thÂ© wharves is left standing. Soma
of the smaller buildings of the Albion
cannery were also carried away. The
watchman .thought that the entire can
nery was going out and he hoisted slg-
Ttals of distress. These' attracted atten
tion from Steveston and the watchman
was brought off.

German Cruiser Vineta Now at the
Venezuelan Port.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 27, via Gal
veston. â The German cruiser Vineta
anchored off La Guayra to-day.
A.i interesting incident occurred early
in_T.he day. When the Venezuela health
officer v.ent alongside the Vineta at 6
o'clock in the morning he was not ai
lov.ed to board her.
Tho Venezuelan officers immediately in
terpreted the action of the German offi
cers lo mean that the cruiser had visited
La Guayra on warlike business in con
nection with the claims of German clti
zena. Sut at S o'clock a German officer
called on the authorities and explained
that ihe refusal to allow the health offi
cer to beard the Vineta was due to the
fact that he went alongside the cruiser
at :oo early an hour.

Believes That Venezuela Will Yield
to Her Demands.
FAHIS. Dec. 27.â The Foreign, Office
hero confirms tlie report from Port-of-
Spair., Trinidad, that the Government of
France has notified the Venezuelan Gov
ernment that the rights of M. Secrestat
cf Bordeaux have been infringed by the
seizure of the property in Venezuela, of
Sencr Manuel A. Matos, the leader cf the
new revolution against President Castro.
The French Government holds that the
property no longer belongs to Senor
Alatos, as he had leased it to M. Secre
stet. and that the Venezuelan Govern
ment is bouiid by the recognition cf M.
Eecrestat's title by the Venezuelan Con
sul nere, before whom the question came
tip.
Tlie ir rench Government rloes not expect
that any complications wfll arise on ac
cour.t cf its representations on the sub
ject, to Venezuela and is not considering
the adoption of measures to enforce the
claims of M. Secrestat, as it expects the
question, to be settled in a few days.

BODY OF GIRL
IN THE RIVER
Fate of Missing Nellie
Cropsey Is at Last
Learned.
Coroner's Jury Is of Opinion
That She Was Victim of
Murder.
ELIZABETH CITY, N. C, Dec. 27.-Fiv e
weeks of mystery and speculation as to
the fate of Miss Nellie Cropsey termi
nated to-day at 10 o'clock, when the body
of the missing girl was found floating in
the river opposite her father's house.. The
body was discovered by J. D. Stillman,
a fisherman. Upon discovering that the
floating object was the body of a
young girl, he immediately notified the
Coroner. When found the body was
lioating face downward. AH the wear
ing apparel was intact with the exception
of the rubbers which Nellie wore on the
night cf her disappearance. With the ex
ception of some slight discoloration of
the face th/j body was in a state of good
preservation and little decomposed. The
body was easily identified as that of Nel
lie Cropsey. The spot where the body
was found had been dragged several
times since her disappearance but with
no result.
Great crowds assembled in front of the
Academy of Music building, where the
jury was in session, waiting for the ver
ulct of the jury as to whether the girl
met with foul play or committed suicide.
Anticipating that trouble may be brew
ing for younjy Wilcox, the Naval Reserve
have been ordered out to maintain order
j..nu peace and to see that no violence Is
oiiered Wilcox. By order of the Mayor
all the barrooms in the city have been
closed. Wilcox has been removed from
the Mayor,' s orfice, where he has been
since his arrest this afternoon, to the
County Jail for his own protection- and
fe strong guard has been placed around
the jail to see that no violence is offered
him.
Wilcox apparently maintains the same
indifferent air that has characterized his
actions all the way through this case.
The report made by the physicians, who
performed the autopsy on Miss Cropsey,
says:
"The garments showed no marks of vio
lence. Xhere were no external marks of
violence on the head, body or face. There
was a discoloration of a pinkish tinge on
the front of the head and face, with a
slight bluish discoloration on the back of
the neck. There were no marks- upon the
front of her neck, except as made by con
striction of her dress collar.
"The appearance of the stomach and
other abdominal organs was normal. The
luncs were collapsed and free from water.
The heart was normal.
"Upon the section of the scalp all
around the head one inch above the brow
there was found a dark discoloration of
the muscular substance.
"The bone beneath this " contusion was
discolored slightly blue. There -was no
other abnormality on any other part of
the scalp, which was completely dissected.
There was no fracture discovered at any
point of the .cranium. A thorough ex
amination of the brain showed no evi
dence of violence."
The verdict of the Coroner's jury, ren
dered late to-night, was as follows:
"We, the Coroner's .jury, having been
duly summoned and sworn by Dr. I. Fer
ing to inquire what caused the death of
Ella M. Cropsey. do hereby report that
from the investigation made by three phy
sicians of Elizabeth City and from their
opinion and also from our personal ob
servations, that said Ellen M. Cropsey
came to her death by being stricken a
blow on the left temple and by being
drowned in the Pasquotank River. We
have not yet investigated nor heard any
testimony touching as to who inflicted the
blow and did the drowning. We are in
formed that one James Wilcox is charged
v,"itli the same and is now in custody. AV"e
recommend that investigation as to his
or any one else's probable guilt be heard
by one or more magistrates in Elizabeth
City Township and that said Wilcox be
held to await said inve<~ nation."

stalled at Bloomington, about tifteen

hind it the track is covered with from
two to four inches of sand.
The Southern Pacific overland from the

"William Mees' carriage shop has been
wrecked by the wind. It was a large
frame building and parts of it have been
scattered for hundreds of, feet around.
The corrugated iron . roof of Edward
Katz's warehouse was torn to pieces and
fragments of the roof were carried for
over a hundred feet. A restaurant build

storm experienced in years. The wind be
gan blowing early in the day and con
tinued blowing- until late in the evening,
clouds of dust and sand partially obscur

uncomfortable to venture out of doors and
impossible to do any work. Some dam

The city was without communication

OXNARD SUGGESTS A WAY '
TO SETTLE SUGAR PROBLEM
He Believes That the Government
Should Pay a Bounty to
Cuban Planters.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.â Henry T. Ox
nard, the head of the beet sugar trust,
has presented another suggestion for the
settlement of the Cuban sugar problem.
dbtnard wants a commission created to
investigate the condition of the Cuban
sugar interests, with a view to paying a
bounty to; Cuban planters on the sugar
they produce. Oxnard thinks this would
satisfy the Cuban sugar planters and
save the necessity for granting any tariff
concessions to Cuba in the way of recip
rocal trade relations. On the Cuban
sugar crop this year Oxnard would give
a bounty that would take $7,000,000 from
the United States treasury to be given to
foreign producers, with no benefit to any
one in this country except two sugar
trusts that are waging war against each
other, but trying to keep up the price of
sugar to consumers.

JAPANESE POST
IS NOT VACANT
No Jrnmed r-to* Change
o; Ministers Is
Story of General Barnes' Ap
pointment Proves to Be
n Premature.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. T)ec. 27.â Regarding the
report that President "Roosevelt had se
lected General W. H. L. Barnes of San
Francisco as successor to Hon. E. A.
Buck, Minister to Japan, It is declared
upon .excellent authority here that no
change in that office is at present con~
templated.^ It is understood at the State
Department that Minister Buck has not
intimated his desire to be relieved, and,
as his record as diplomatic officer is
wholly satisfactory to the department and
to the administration it is not the pur
pose to disturb him In his present place.
This is said to be the substance of In
formation imparted by Secretary Hay to
Senator Perkins, who has recently made
inquiries at the department relative to a
possible change in the Japanese mission,
having specially in view the chances for
the appointment of General Barnes in
case Mr. Buck were to retire. The name
of General Barnes, in that event, would
be presented to the consideration of the
President, but the opportunity for filling
such a desirable mission would bring to
the President many strongly backed ap
plications for the place from various quar
ters.
Minister Buck, who was a member of
the Republican National Committee from
Georgia at the time of his appointment to
Japan by President McKinley, has served
at his â¢ present post since 1S97. In well
informed circles here it is believed he may
continue at Toklo indefinitely.
General Barnes was seen at the Cali
fornia Hotel last evening and said that
he had read the article in an evening
paper announcing his - appointment as
Minister to Japan. â¢
"It proved very pleasant reading," he
said, "but I must say I can neither af
firm nor deny the story. I have not re
ceived word of any kind from Washing
ton regarding the appointment. If it were
tendered me I would surely accept it. I
have seen dispatches from "Washington
stating that my name was mentioned. I
have a slight acquaintance with President
Roosevelt and am vary friendly with Sec
retary Hay. When the late President was
visiting: this city he practically assured
me that I would be considered when the
office was vacant. I would like to enter
the diplomatic service, and were I ap
pointed I would esteem it a great honor."
Friends of State Senator Chester Rowell
of Fresno are making an active fight to
procure for him the Japanese mission.
Rowell has the backing of United States
Senator Bard.

NINE VESSELS
MAY BE LOST
Fears Entertained for
Ships Missing From
Olallam.
All Were Seen Before Storm
and They Then Dis
appeared. \
SEATTLE, Dec. 27.â The grimmest story
of marine disaster in all the history of
the hungry North Pacific is expeeted by
local marine men from Clallam. Bay to
morrow. The fate of nine vessels, caught
by the Christmas storm in that body of
water which lies like a trap right in the^.
path of southwest gales, is not knowi*.
Old mariners fear that one or all may lie
lost. Sound tugs went on the lookout for
these craft to-day. Some of these tugs
are expected in port to-morrow.
These vessels are: American ship Wil
liam H. Alacy, American ship Bangalore,
British ship Oweenee, British ship Iverna,
American baxkentine Katy Flickinger.
American bark Carleton and three Ameri
can schooners, names unknown.
All were seen at anchor in Clallam Bay
Christmas day. None of them were known
to have left before the closing of night
en the waters. Any . of their number
caught in the bay .during the storm could
not have escaped â this i3 the opinion oÂ£
marine men. "
Clallam Bay, with the rocks of Van
couver Island before it and to its rear
the canyons of the Olympics so lying that
they carry the blasts of a southwest wind
direct UDon its exposed surface, has Ions
been regarded with fear by mariners dur
ing such a storm as that of Christmas
day.
So placed are the mountain passes to
the south and the west that they draw
down a southwest gale upon this spot.
They concentrate its blasts upon the few
square miles of water. Fo*te vessel to
let go anchor to such a wind is to run the
risk of fetching up on the rocks of Yf" 1 "
couver Island across the straits. That
shore offers no harbor. The lack of sea
way precludes the possibility of beating
out Into the open ocean. No report or any
of this hapless fleet has come to this port.
Remarkable Escape From Death.

IT IS IMPORTANT
To Zno-w What You Are Taking
When Using: Catarrh Medicine.
Catarrh is the short rout* to consump-
tion, and the importance of early and ju-
diclous treatment of catarrh, whether lo-
cated In the head, throat or bronchial
'â¢ tubes, cannot be too strongly emphasized.
1 The list of catarrh cures Is as Ions as
the moral law and the forms In -which
they are administered numerous and con-
fusing, from sprays, Inhalers, washes,
ointments and salves to powders, liquids K
and tablets.
The tablet form Is undoubtedly tho most
convenient and the most effective, but
with nearly all advertised catarrh reme-
dies it is almost entirely a matter oÂ£
guesswork as to what you are taking into
your system, as the proprietors, -while
making all sorts of claims as to what
their medicines will do, always keep It a
close secret as to what they are.
The success and popularity of the new
catarrh cure,. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, is
largely because it not only cures catarrh
but because catarrh sufferers who use these-
tablets know what they are taking into
their systems. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
are composed of Red Gum, Blood Root
and similar valuable and antiseptic Ingre-
dients, and are pleasant to the taste and
being dissolved in the mouth they take
Immediate effect upon the mucous lining
of the throat, nasal passages and whola
respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished in old chronic cases of
catarrh are Uttle short of remarkable, and
the advantage of knowing what you are
putting into your stomach is of para-
mount importance when it is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using- secret catarrh remedies.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval from physicians, becauso
their antiseptic character render them
perfectly safe for the general public to uso
and their composition makes them a com-
mon sense cure for all forms ot catarrhal
troubles.
AH druggists sell them at 50 cts. for full
sized packages.

Early Change in Chief o:
Navy Department Is
Expected.
Former Assistant Secretary
Slated for a Cabinet
Position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 27.â Sec-
Tljtanr Long, not Secretary Wilson, will
be tne next man to leave the Cabinet,
and Charles H. Allen of Massachusetts Is
among the strong possibilities of succes
sion.
Mr. Allen was assistant Secretary of
the navy during the Spanish -war, being
the immediate successor of Mr. Roosevelt.
3iis administration of the office during
that important period was said to be in
every respect admirable. He was regard
ed as a model official and his record was
so good that he was advanced to the im
portant post of Governor of Porto Rico.
Indeed. Mr. Allen was induced to take the
assistant Secretaryship by President Mc
ivinley on the understanding that he
should become Secretary of the Navy
â¢whien Mr. I_/ong desired to retire, and
after the war there was considerable talk
that the Secretary would resign and re
turn to his law practice in Boston. He
decided to remain, however, and Mr. Al
len was given the post in Porto Rico.
A New England Senator who is in the
Cabinet-making conrider.ee of the Presi
dent as much as it is possible for any one
to be said to-day that Secretary Long's
successor would certainly come from New
England. In that case Mr. Allen of Low
ell. Mass., is altogether the strongest
probability. He is young:, full of energy
and quite a man of the R.ocsevelt type.
No time has yet been tixed for Secre
tary Long's retirement. He has a perfect
understanding in the matter, with the
President and their relations are most
cordial. His resignation, when it comes,
will be the result of a determination made
long ago and thoroughly understood by
Mr. Roosevelt. It only remained for him
fix a time convenient to both.
Secretary WUson, is in the Cabinet cer
tainly for some time to come. The report
from Kansas that he is soon to be suc
ceeded by F. D. Coburn can be dismissed
Â£t once. It- was discussed at the Cabinet
meeting to-day and shortly afterward an
official announcement was again made
that Mr. Wilson was not to resign. In
fact, in the process of gradual disintegra
tion which is sure to eorne. it is quite like
ly that the President's official family will
lose either Secretary Hitchcock or Secre
tary Haj- before Mt Wilson.

Body.
NEW YORK. Dec. 27.â There was bur
ied in Cypress Hills Cemetery last March
a body believed to be that of Frank Hol
burn, tv ho, four months before, had dJs
appeared from his home at 143 Ainslle
rtreet, "Williamsburg 1 , where he lived with
his wife and two sons. He had .been out
of employment and on the day he was last
seen by his family and his father, Henry
liolburn, he vowed he would find work
If he had to tramp all over the world.
The body supposed to be that of Hol
burn was found in the Hackensack
River, and although the features were
unrecognizable, his family found inarks
which made tnem certain it was his.
To-day the missing man's father re
ceived a letter purporting to be from his
ton, postmarked San Francisco. Holburn
made no reference to his silence, but ex
plained that he had nearly circled the
globe since leaving Brooklyn. He in
quired about his wife and children, and
fcaid he was going to settle In San Jose,
California, when he would send after his

ITRE STILL BURNS
IN THE SHINANO'S HOLD
Japanese Vessel Arrives at Seattle
and Blaze May Soon Be Ex
tinguished.
SEATTLE, Dec. 27.â The steamship Shi
nano of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha ar
rived here this morning, the - fire which
forced her to return from sea still smol
ering, perhaps blazing, in her hold. Late
last night the Shinano left Port Town
send, where she had arrived early in the
morning, and came on up the Sound. She
anchored off the Smith Cove docks at 4
a. m.
The fire, which is confined to the for
ward part of the ship's hold, is being kept
â¢well under control. It is believed to have
originated through spontaneous combus
tion of cotton, which composes the great
er part of the Shinano's cargo. It was
discovered December 22, at 11:30 a. m., in
latitude 51 degrees 15 minutes and longi
tude 149 degrees 15 minutes west, 1025 miles
off Cape Flattery. A strong westerly wind
was blowing and the seas were running
high. Tne first intimation came in smoke
emitted from the forecastle. Fourteen of
the crew were overcome, though all re
vived -when removed to fresh air. The
passengers of the vessel acted with the
utmost composure. There was no excite
ment, and, under the direction of Cap
tain Cope, the hatches were .battened
down and steam turned into the hold to
smother the fire. The vessel at once put
back for the straits. She made the re
turn voyage under her own steam. At
least that portion of the cargo in the im
mediate vicinity of the fire will have to be
discharged, and until this Is done the ex
tent of the damage cannot be ascertained.

PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 27.â The com

Friends Peace Conference to prepare a
message for President Roosevelt to-day
mailed a copy of the address to the White
House. Following is an excerpt from the
address:
We have observed with encouragement and
satisfaction the passage in the message to
Congress in which the declarations are made
that the '"true end of every great and free
people should be self-respecting peace"; that
"this nation most earnestly desires sincere and
cordial friendship with all others," and "that
more and more the civilized peoples are realiz
ing the wicked folly of war, and are attaining
that condition of Just and intelligent regard
for the rights of others which will in the end
make world-wide peace possible."
We earnestly desire that these sentiments, so
true and timely, may grow and prevail, and
that during thy administration the public
opinion in behalf of rational methods for set
tling international differences may be fostered,
and all possible steps be taken to make such
methods practical and effective.

CIVIL MARRIAGE OF SENATOR DEPEW
AND MISS PALMER OCCURS IN NICE
Wedding Takes Place in the American Consulate and the
Nuptial Knot Will Be Tightened To-Day by Religious
Ceremonies at Notre Dame and in the Episcopal :Church
NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â The World
has the following from Nice: Sen
ator Chauncey M. Depew and
Miss May Palmer were married at
the United States Consulate here
to-day. Consul Van Buren performing the
ceremony. American consular and diplo
matic history has not on record an in
stance of a similar event in which a rep
resentative of the United States Govern
ment officiated as the celebrant of a mar
riage. Mr. Van Buren performed the
service under special dispensation from
the authorities in Washington.
The principals and a iew relatives and
friends assembled soon after noon at the
villa of Count de Sers and were driven
to the Consulate, where they arrived a
little before 3 o'clock. The utmost pri
vacy was observed.
The bride-elect had for her two wit
nesses, demanded by the laws of France,
the Comte de Cantalouse and her brother
in-law, Baron Adolph Van Andre. The
witnesses for the Senator wererMames
Gordon Bennett and the Count de Sers.
The bride was very quietly butvcharm
ingly gowned in a walking costume.
Senator Depew, who was In the gayest of
spirits, wore a black cutaway morning
coat and gray trousers. His tie was of
blue and white.
The ceremony consumed about twenty
minutes, after which the wedding party
returned to the villa of the Count de Sers
in two carriages. Mrs. Palmer accom
panied her daughter, and others present
besides the witnesses enumerated were
the Countess de Sers and Baroness Van
Andre, sister of the bride.
American flags, flying from three well
equipped carriages drawn up outside the
American Consulate, alone indicated that
something unusual was going on inside.
The shutters of the Consulate were closed.
Inside bright lamps, were burning and a
silken American flag was spread over a
table, around which stood the principals,
the witnesses and the few other persons
present.

MEXICO AGREES
TO ARBITRATE
Claim of the California
Jesuits Will Be
Settled.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.â The State De
partment has just added another to the
long list of arbitrations which it has ar
ranged within the last few years for the
settlement of American claims. This ar
bitration will provide for the settlement
of the Pious fund, which has been a sub
ject of diplomatic exchange between Lite
United States and Mexico since the Mexi
can war.
The claim arose through .the failure of
the Mexican Government to pay to the
Archbishop of California interest on lau.ls
belonging to the Jesuits, for which the
Mexican Government acted as trustee.
The claim was submitted to the Mexican
Claims Commission in 1877 and judgment
given in favor of the church for about
$1,000,000. The Mexican Government al
leged that the payment extinguished the
claim, but the State Department held that
the interest began again from the date of
award and lias run until at present it
amounts to another $1,000,000.
Personal representation by the Arch
bishop of California, who recently was in
California and other dignitaries of the
Catholic Church, caused the department
to press the matter, with the result stat
ed. The name of the arbitrator and other
details remain to be announced.
Novel Places for Dining Parties.
At the Paris ' Exhibition 150 persons

enormous barrel, was large enough for
an army of 3000 men to stand in its in
terior. A year wa3 spent in building it,
and its cost was $12,000. About two years
ago an immense whale was driven ashore
on the coast of Norway.- It yielded bone
and oil worth $12,600, and, in honor of the

which, after the removal of the blubber,
afforded ample sitting room for thirty
guests. ''i.-'.-.i V: :

TURKISH TOBACCO
NOT "CORNERED"
German Dealers Do Not
Fear the American
, Trust.
BERL.IN,' Dec. 27.â Inquiry among the
tobacco manufacturers of Berlin does not
reveal the existence of any great diffi
culty in obtaining Turkish tobacco. The
prices of this article, which are now
higher than usual, are attributed to the*
demand' being greater than the supply.
The American Tobacco Company is a
large user of Turkish tobacco in its
American, British and recently acquired
German factories. From information
here the tobacco trust seems undoubtedly
to be the largest buyer of tobacco in the
world, and a larger holder of tbbacco,
several times over, than any of its com
petitors. This, it is said here, is a very
different thing from cornering or attempt
ing to corner the Turkish tobacco crop.
President Duke of the American Tobac
co Company has been here for ten days,
engaged in personally examining the to
bacco - manufacturing situation. The" im
portant tobacco firms here say that they
have not received any propositions from
President Duke.
It was reported from Berlin on Decem
ber 15 that President Duke had acquired
the Jasmetzil Cigarette Company of Dres
den and the business of Kyriazi of Berlin.
The same advices said tnat two; other
Dresden tobacco concerns would be amal
gamated and then be absorbed by the
American Tobacco Company.

The trouble, arose over the requirement
that there must be r a! civil marriage cere
mony. So much authenticated informa
tion concerning the bridegroom and bride
was required by the French code that it
would have been impossible to produce
proofs without great loss of .time. â¢ Final
ly/, it,, was- decided that . the" difficulties
might be met by having Consul General
Gowdy perform the marriage ceremony in
the Consulate General, which is nominal
ly American territory. The State Depart
ment forbids Consular officers performing
marriages, but an exception was made in
this case. Gowdy and Emb^tsador Porter
had been Instructed, however, to consu't
the French authorities as to the legality
of a marriage by a United States Con

it were absolutely settled that his right
to do so was clear. . â

DEATH CLOSES
LEARY'S CAREER
Noted Naval Officer Dies
From Attack of
Heart Disease.
Navy Department Mourns
Loss of Brave and Effi
cient Seaman.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 27.â The
Navy Department this morning received
the following telegram from. Admiral
Mortimer L. Johnson, commanding the
Boston navy yard, dated to-day:
Captain Richard P. Leary. United States
navy, died this morning at Marine Hospital,
Chelsea. .;
Captain Leary was the first Governor of
Guam after that island came into the
possession of the United States. He was
relieved of the command of the receiving
ship' Richmond last October on account
of heart trouble and granted six months'
leave of absence.
Captain Leary was held in high regard
by his fellow sailors because of the nerve
he showed in the presence of two German
warships in the harbor of Apia, Samoa,
during the stirring times which wound up
in the tremendous hurricane that wiped
out the German and American fleets in
those waters in May, 1889. Leary was in
command of the little Adams, a third-rate
vessel of antique 1 type, and finding that
the Germans were about to interfere for
cibly In support of their own candidate
for the Samoan chieftainship he cleared
ship for action, first placing himself in
a position to command either approach
and forbade any interference. He was
not molested and remained at his post
until the American squadron under Ad
miral Kimberly arrived, when he was
sent north in the Adams, thus escaping
the great hurricane. He was a unique
figure as the first naval Governor of the
island of Guam, w.hich he ruled as he
would a ship; breaking up immorality by
obliging the natives to marry; calling
upon the men for a certain amount of
work every week and even prescribing
the minimum number of poultry which
should be maintained in each family. He
was appointed from Maryland and en
tered the naval service in I860. He com
manded the San Francisco during the
West Indian campaign of the Spanish
war.

CAST AMERICAN
IN A DUNGEON
Seattle Man Has Bitter
Experience Among
Austrians.
Says They Imprisoned Him
Falsely and Stole His
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 27.â Three years ago
Benjamin Greenburg, a harness maker,
left Seattle with the Intention of enjoy
ing a trip in Europe. After a series of
adventures such as fall to the lot of
few men he is again in this city, with the
statement that he is "glad still to be in
the flesh and once again on Puget
Sound."
Greenburg arrived in Seattle to-day.
For two months Greenburg lay in a damp
dungeon in Austria and was given hardly
enough food to keep body and soul to
gether. He was not allowed to communi
cate with his friends and dally wa3 put
through the "sweating process" in the
endeavor to make him confess that he
was another person and guilty of violat
ing the Austrian lawa.
Greenburg left Seattle in 1S37. Ho Is a
Russlon by birth, but had been natural
ized and felt that in making a tour of
.Europe he would be accorded the rights
and privileges of an American citizen. In
this he recKoned without the Auatrians.
He was arrested at Tarnopol while on a
visit to friends and thrown into prison.
On the morning following his arrest, he
says, he was visited by the police and In
formed that if he would pay $1000 he
would be released without further
trouble. He refused. This angered the
authorities and they kept him in jail for
two months. His iate was learned by a
friend, however, 'who carried the. news
to the American Consul at Vienna. Upon
that official making a protest, Greenburg
was granted freedom on giving a cash
bond of $1000, after the charge had been
formally preferred that he was Peter
Carpovich, a Greek, who .had been ex
pelled from Austria, for procuring women
lor immoral purposes.
Aided by the American Consul, Green
burg obtained evidence that he was the
person he represented himself to be. The
case was allowed to drag along for more
than a year and was finally transferred
to the highest court. When the trial was
held a number of hired thugs, Greenburg
asserts, were brought forward to show
that he was Peter Carpovich. Their per
jury was easily shown up in its true light
and he was acquitted. Since that time
Greenburg has traveled around Europe
m search of health, as the treatment he
endured in prison seriously impaired his
physical condition. *
The money he deposited as ball at
Tarnopol has never been returned. He
will present the facts in the case to the
authorities at "Washington and believes
that in the long run he will secure what
is due him.
Gain More Ground for Poles.
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 27.â Judge Buck
to-day decided the case of the Standard
Electric Light Company of California
against MacMonagle et al., executors ol
the will of William Corbitt, deceased. The
action was brought to condemn a right
of way over the Corbitt ranch at Bur
lingame for the purpose of erecting- poles
and stringing wires to conduct into San
Francisco from Amador County electric
light, heat and power. By the decision the
plaintiff is granted the right of way upon
the payment to the defendants of the sum
of $400. There now remains but one right
of way to be secured by the company in
order to complete its system to San
Francisco, and that a very snort one. re
quiring but twelve poles.

CORINTHIAN TARS
PREPARING FOR
ANNUAL DINNER
Feast Will Be Spread in the
Boathouse, Tiburon, by the
Yachting Club Caterer
The yacht that is being built in Twiggs'
shop at Xorth Point has not yet been
brought out, but will leave the house for
the open air soon. A little work will be
done upon her and then she will be
launched, after which her mast will be
stepped and her rigging set up.
On New Year's day the Corinthians will
enjoy their annual dinner at the 'club
house, Tiburon, the members having been
requested to leave San Francisco by the
11 o'clock boat in the morning, so that
they may sit down at noon, or shortly
after, and may have plenty of time to
enjey the bounteous feast and sit around
Comfortably afterward. As several of the
members like to return to the city by the
4 o'clock boat from Tiburon an early
start with the dinner Is desirable. This
was not possible when some of them de
layed until the l;30 p. m. boat from San
Francisco. As the culinary department of
the clubhouse has been much extended
and improved the coming- banquet is ex
pected to surpass those of all previous
reunions.
At various times there has been talk
of the Corinthian Yacht Club occupying
anew location, and one of the spots sug
gested was Point Richmond. But the club
is on the whole well satisfied with its
present location, except that it would like
to secure permanent possession of the
point on which its buildings stand. It Is
said that the whole of Valentines Island
could be purchased for about, ten thou
sand dollars, but that the club has not so
far been able to buy the point and right
of way only. It is probable that Valen
tines Island will eventually become a site
for residences just as Belvedere has done,
and the club might be able to buy the
whole island, partition it off into building
lots and make enough by the sale of them
to get its own location free. As the arti
cles of "Incorporation of the club do not
empower the directors to buy or Bell land,
it Is doubtful whether the club could en
ter into what would really amount to a
real estate business. The purposes of the
corporation are to model and build
yachts and to promote the eHlciency of
its members/and others in the art of
handling them. Doubtless the directors
are empowered to purchase land on which
to build a boathouse. or to- sell a site once
occupied by the ciub and buy another, but
it Is doubtful whether they could buy a
tract of land, subdivide It and sell the
larger part, retaining only a .small piece
for their own use.

BOATING CLUBS
ELECT OFFICERS
FOR THE YEAR
Preparing for a Season of
| Activity on the Bay in
i Barge and Racing Shell
T{ie principal business occupying the
attention of the rowing clubs at the pres
ent time is the election pf officers. The
Dolphins have already chosen a new
board to serve during the coming year.
At the fortnightly meeting held in the
boathouse -at the foot of Chestnut street,
Alameda, "last .Monday evening, the fol
lowing were nominated for the various
offices of the Alameda Boating Club,: For
president, Charles H. Smith; viie presi
dent, F.'S;'Cone; secretary. W. B. Hinch
man; treasurer, A. G. Bell; captain, H.
E. Kelsohr lieutenant, ' Z. T. Thorning;
members -of the executive committeeâ A.
L. Kihm, E. B. Thorning and J. S. Peter
sen. There" is at present no â¢ sign of op
position to anyof the nominees, and it is
likely all -wHl -be -elected at the meeting
to be tiehi oh Tuesday, January 14. The
Alamerta- 1 Boating Club made a consider
able sum at 'its' recent annual entertain
ment and. is , in â¢ good financial condition.
The bcJathouse' will" be 1 put into good or
der and the assembly room will be var
nished;'M>ainted-and-par-tly.refurnished to
render it I&Bre 'attlactlve' to the members.
Perlcjflidatiy; the ' Question comes up be
fore thq *Bpar(J:of Supervisors of remov
ing the- obstruction- at the southerly end
of Third street. Of these obstructions the
principal SiB tJieTbo&thduse and handball

mission' Id remain on the present site for
eighteen months, during which time the
club would endeavor to> secure another
site. Supervisor . W. N. McCarthy said
the removal of- the boathouse would leave
the street In a worse condition than it is
in. now and should' not be enforced until
either the city or the owners of the prop
erty in that spot show they intend to im
prove the street by building a wharf. The
Supervisors were in favor of making some
concession to the rowing club, and on
the attorney of the 1 club giving a pledge
that no further extension of time would
be asked, gave the club permission to re
main in their present location "eighteen
months longer. #
At the last session of the State Legis
lature it was intended to introduce a bill
allotting a definite site for boathouses for
amateur oarsmen on San Francisco bay.
but in the scramble at the close of the
session nothing came of It. It is believed
that- a bill to this effect will be definitely
framed at the next session.
About five months ago the Triton Boat
ing Club. flndingÂ»that sand had encroach
ed so much on the water near their boat
house that it, was quite difficult to launch
a beat, placed the house on a float and
began the journey toward a more west
erly location at the foot of Larkln street.
After traversing about three hundred
yards the barge, which was in a leaky
condition, filled and sank in shallow wa
ter. On December 8 a second attempt was
made with a new barge and the house
was successfully conveyed to 4 Its present
site. This is on the beach neiar the foot
of Larkin street and is well adapted for
boating and swimming. The new wharf
for the Italian fishing craft has recently
had a breakwater added to It, which has
broken the force of the tide rip and ren
dered the water between Black Point and
the works of the Equitable Gaslight
Company calmer.
Some of the owners of arks which are
moored in Tiburon Cove during the sum
mer have expressed an intention of spend
ing the winter at North Beach.
Jordan Asks for an Accounting.
Dennis Jordan, a contractor, filed a suit
for an accounting yesterday against John
F. Kennedy, who is also a contractor.
Jordan,' according to his complaint,, ob
tained a contract, in 1894 to erect a bar
racks at the Presidio. He commenced the
building and then entered Into an agree
ment with Kennedy whereby the latter
agreed to complete.it. Jordan now claims
that Kennedy, in rendering an account of
his expenditures, charged himself with ex
penses that were never contracted. Jor
dan asks the cour,t to determine the
amount which, according to the agreed
ment made, should be paid to him by
Kennedy.

INAUGURAL STAKE
Flee*est Dogs on the Coast
Are in Training for the
Annual Event in Coursing
The Inaugural stake is the next big
event that is promised for the Union
Coursing Park patrons. The stake Is- of
that class that calls for the pick of cham
pion greyhounds and only the speediest
of coursers can be expected to make a
showing in the event. â¢ The crack fliers
of the big kennels have been in special
training for the meeting and the list of
entries will show the names of the great
est coursing hounds in America. The
stake is limited to sixteen entries, with
entrance fee fixed at $10, and will be run
in its entirety on Sunday, January 5.
Already such noted dogs as Palo Alto,
Beacon, Rector, Vandal, Floodgate, Real
Article, A. J. Martin, Hickory Dick, Tra
lee Boy, Little Sister, Narcissus, Flying
Fox, Sacramento Boy, Wedgewood, Tibu
ron and Sisciuoc are promised for the
event, and with such recognized perform
ers a fast meeting is assured.
This will be Sisquoc's first time out
since his memorable coursing at Peta
luma in the plains meet, in which the
many times stake winner was forced to
long and heart-breaking trials such as
have probably never been seen on any
other coursing field since.
Sisquoc's long rest lias worn away the
effects of his severe going on his home
grounds and his owner is satisfied that
the hound will be fit and ready to carry
away first honors In the rich event.
With Palo Alto ?nd Beacon on th<Â»
cards, the admirers of the rival coursers
are hoping that these two candidates for
honors will come together and on equal
conditions.
Both coursers will have plenty of back
ing and It is not unlikely that they wlil
be equal favorites for the- stake. To
reach the final, however, will be no easy
work for either of these champions, for
among the entries are coursers that are
dangerous opponents in the best of stake3.
Lord Brazen, the star performer of G.
Lacey Crawford's St. Louis Kennel, is on
the sick list, with about even chances for
recovery, though if the best of medical
science and an unstinted expenditure of
money can save the noted hound Lord
Brazen s speedy return to health 13 as
sured. In his effort to save his favorite
courser Mr. Crawford has secured the
services of a veterinary surgeon and has
a staff of nurses to give their entire time
t0 , * the care 0{ tne 6 Â°S- The highest
priced champagne is a feature of the list
.or delicacies ordered for the dog and, in
fact, no child could.be given more care
and attention than tHe millionaire leash
man has secured for his greyhound.
The Pastime Coursing Club of St. Louis
has been given judgment In the suit
brought against it by the Humane Society
Â°f, that city and the sport of the leash
will, through the efforts of the influential
association, be made a popular one.
. The season will close on January 1, and
as soon thereafter as practicable Mr.
Crawford will send the best performers
of his Scennel to California for the winter,
In charge of Trainer Jackson, to compete
in the stakes at Union Park.
Thomas Hall of Merced, one of the best
known leashmen in the State, has de
clared his intention of bringing some dogs
to compete In the Belle Brandon cup stake
on. the cards for February 22. This rich
annual coursing event was named in hon
or of Mr. Haifa courser, Belle Brandon,
who won the final at the first meet.
Union Park offers two stakes for to-day
and to-morrow. Both events will be run
to-day and the finals will ue concluded
to-morrow. Likely winners in the special
stake are:
Wedding Bells, Gold ' Bug, Bonnie Hufrliie

GOLFERS READY
FOR NEW-YEAR'S
DAY HANDICAP
Same Conditions Will Be in
Force? as Ruled at the
Thanksgiving Day Meeting
On New Year's day there will be a
thirty-six hole handicap golf tournament
the Presidio links. This is the tour
nament that was arranged for Thanks
giving .day. On account of the bad
weather and the small number of entries
S. L. Abbot Jr. and H. C. Golcher. the
winners, did not claim their prizes, but
left them in the hands of the directors
to be played for on another day. As
New Year's day is the day en which the
medal play championship of the San
Francisco Golf Ciub Is annually decided,
the first eighteen holes on New Year's
day may be turned in as a championship
score. The player making the lowesst
ecore will be entitled to the possession
of the Liverpool gold medal for one year.
The San Francisco Golf Club also has a
Liverpool silver medal, for which a con
test is to be held once a month during
the season, but no one remembers when
the las^ contest was held and few of the
members knoY/ v/Ijo the holder of the
modal is.
Karly in the new year, when the
Christmas and New Year iestlvities are
over, the Ladies' Annex of the San
Francisco Golf Ciub will resume business
on the links, the tirst event set uown on
the schedule being the qualitying rounds
over eighteen holes, meual play, for the
fifth competition for the council's cup
for ladles. These will be held on Mon
day, January 0, beginning at 9:30 a. m.
The eight competitors who make the
lowest scores will be entitled to enter
the match play rounds for the trophy.
The Sausalito golfers have been having
a hard time of it for several months
past. Owing to the large building opera
tions being carried on by the Federal
Government the first three hole3 have
been entirely spoiled, and in order to play
at all it is r.ecesasry to begin at the
fourth and to play the fourth, fifth and
sixth twice to make up a round. Then
the course is rough, and in several places
outcropping reck makes bad ties for the
ball. However, when the barracks are
completed there will be a considerable
military population at Fort Baker, and
most of the younger officers will prob
ably devote a good deal of time to galf.
As soon as the buildings are finished,
which will hardly be for some months,
the course will be laid out afresh, somo
cf the existing holes being used. The
grass Is being cropped by a flock of 800
sheep, which are kept to their work by
a herder, who camps In a tent on the
links. .Major. TV W. M. Draper, president
cf the Sausalito Golf Club, returned a
few days ago from a visit to the Eastern
States. He did not play in the contest
that was held last Saturday for the Fos
ter cup. Leonard Chencry. Worthlnrton
Ames and Frank B. Findley, the holder
of the trophy, were also absent from the
cantest.
I There was a good deal of golfing en
â¢the Oakland links last Saturday. Gecrge
E. de Golia, going round with Mrs. H
H. Sherwood, made a score of 41 for the
long course, which equals the record
scores of W. P. Johnson and F. S. Strat

TENNIS REVIVAL
IS FELT ON THE
ALAMEDA COURTS
Christmas Day Matches Are
Responsible for Bringing
Out Former Enthusiasts
The revival in tennis which started in
this city a farw months ago has reached
the other side of the bay, and players in
Alameda County are showing more in
terest in the game than ever before.
Years ago tennis was popular in Alameda,
but for the past two or three years there
has .been a noticeable falling off In in
terest. All the old-timers were out on
Christmas day when the interclub
matches were held. The rival clubs were
the Alameda and Bellevue. Reuben Hunt,
the champion of the county and one of the
crack players cf the University of Cali
fornia, represented the former club, while
the strongest player from the Bellevue
was .Percy Murdock. The match between
these two experts was" the best of the
day. To the surprise of the spectators
the champion met defeat at the hands of
Murdock.
Joseph t?. Tobin, who with Walter Mac-
Gavin, was the first doubles champion of
the coast, made his reappearance on the
local courts last Saturday. Tobin was
never rated as high as Will 'Taylor, but
he made a much better impression on the
present generation than did Taylor, who
played a couple of weeks ago. Tobin still
ciings to the small-handled Sears" racket
so popular ten years ago.
Taylor. Tcbln, Eyre and Gus Taylor will
be out every Saturday from now on, and
it will be interesting to note if thev can
bring their play up to the standard of
the Whltneys. â¢
The class singles tournament held on
last Sunday and Christmas on the Califor
nia Club courts was the largest ever held
in this city. Forty players from all parts
of the city too* part. As was expected,
George Whitney carried off the honors
The tournament committee made some
mistakes in handicapping the different
clas? winners. The duterence in the han
dicaps allowed by the championship to
the lower classes and that allowed by the
first class was only "one-sixth of fifteen '"
which is practically no difference at all
Not one cf the class winners had tbe
smallest chance of defeating George
AVhitney with the handicap allowed him
The tournament committee Is composed of
George Whitnay, C. G. Kuehn and Frank
Stnngham. The treatment of Chet Smith
winner of the second class, could hardly
be called fair. After postponing the play
off until Sunday the committee changed
its decision and agreed to run It off on
Christmas. Smith in the meantime had
left the grounds and was defaulted.
Strlneham was not present on Christmas
C. .Dunlap and Harry Routh, the best
tv.o players from the park, disappointed
their admirers somewhat In the tourna
ment. Dunlap was expected to give anv
of cracks a hard fight, but he went
out rather easily. '
William Frost, an old-timer from across
the bay, nearly<carried off the honors in
the second class." He did not go out until
he met Chet Smith, the class winner

MANY SPORTSMEN
SECURE LIMIT
BAGS OF DUCKS
Clear, Cool Weather Makes
the Shooting the Finest
Enjoyed in Many Years
Sport Is Not Confined to Any
One Place, but Is Spread
Over All the Marsh Line
The clear, cool weather and the absence
of rain have combined to make happy
the men who enjoy a day on the marsh
after ducks. Last Sunday's results were
a repetition of those of the previous one,
as ducks were plentiful, and limit bags
were secured by many gunmen.
Four members of the Spooney Gun Club
again secured the limit at their Mount
Eden preserve. The quartet -was made
up of W. Whitehead, Dr. E. N. Short, L.
R. Larzalere and George Morse. Canva>
backs and mallard3 made up the majnr
portion of the bag. For some unexplained
reason there were com paxatively few guns
on the marsh. Owing to the quality ol
the sport afforded on the previous Sun
day It was expected an army of men
would be out. ' ' ~
Up at the Field and Tule Club's pre
serve near Suiaun. six men secured an
average of 41 birds each. They were all
bie birds. "Johnny" Coleman killed the
limit. In his string were 42 sprig. The
other members of tfie paxty were: A. XI.
Shields, A. M. Cummins, J-.. Harrison, t\
V. Bell and M. E. Unger.
Otto Feudner enjoyed groat sport at the
Stewart ponds, near Donverton, last Sun
day With a friend he killed 97 ducks and
followed up this with 10 seese, t> swans
and 17 English snipe. These game
birds were secured within a. small area.
During the past month a number of
gunmen have enjoyed great shooting near
Sobrante. Early in the month A. J. Webb
and H. Emery killed 100 canvasbacks. J^,
T Harrison and a friend secured .Tj
"cans." J. R. l^eavell.r S. â **. Pond and I*
E Leavel! secured a mixed bag of U7
"cans" and blackjacks. Dr. R.' S. Hart
ley of the Board of Health of this city
was one of the fortunate, killing â¢Â» "cans."
Some days since A. von tier Kopp of the
Selby Lead Works killed the limit in four
hours' shooting. His serin? was mostly
"cans." Messrs. Lyon and Hoag each se
cured a good sized bag during 1 the past
week. The preserve -wht-re this great
sport was enjoyed is baited each month
with two ions of barley, which accounts
for its drawing power on the ducks.
Frank Schuitz shot at Mount Eden Ia3t
Sunday and secured some nice birds.
Dr. Knowles killed 43 sprig last Tues-
U< Br'uno Shroeck killed 23 English snipe
at the fresh water lake near San Pedro.
Fred King killed 50 "cans" at Lake Cha

COMPLICATED SCOTT WILL (,
APPEARS IN COURT AGAIN
Partial Distribution of Estate Or
deied on Petition of Guardian
of Testator's Heirs.
A partial distribution of the estate of
the late Mrs. A. It. Scott was ordered in
Department 9 of the Superior Court yes
terday upon the petition of H. VL Owens,
guardian of Eugene Wormell-Byron and
Lettie Wornreli-Byron, nephew and niece
of the deceased.
Mrs. Scott's will was peculiar. When
the document was first written shÂ« mad3
a 'few special legacies and left the rest
and residue of her esta.te, which Is worth
$250 000. to her nephew and niece and to
the children of S. W. Collins, a former
husband.
Subsequently she added a codicil revok
ing certain legacies and providing that
the estate should be divided into fiftieths
among those mentioned in the codicil.
The nephevr and niece raised the point
that they should he paid their legacies
under the provisions o* the body of the
will, which meant that they were each
entitled to one-fiftieth of the entire es
tato and that the other heira would each
receive one-fiftieth of the. residue.
The granting of the petition yesterday
is ah admission that their contention was
correct.'
QUESTIONS THE LEGAI-ITY
OF EXPERTS' EMPLOYMENT
Treasurer Erooks Asks Mayor to In-^
vestigate Auditor. Wells' Alleged
Violation of Charter.
City Treasurer Brooks sent a- communi
cation yesterday to Mayor Phelan In
which he calls attention to the illegal em
ployment of experts by Auditor Wells in
making the annual tax settlement during
December. Brooks informs the Mayor
that three demands for such service were
paid in his office to C. P. Pidwell, A.
Leary and G. Jackson, each calling for
$100. Brooks is of the opinion that Wells
has violated the charter in making the
appointments.
After the demands were paid Brooks
was in doubt whether he should have paid
the warrants and asked the Mayor if the
Board of Supervisors had granted author
ity to the Auditor to employ experts. The
Mayor replied that no such authority was
given, but that Wrtte was allowed to em
ploy a certain number of ordinary clerks
for a temporary period, they to be taken
from the civil service eligible list. Nei
ther of the three experts employed by
Wells is on the eligible list and Brooks
questions the legality of their employ
ment. Mayor Phelan promised Brooks to
investigate the matter.

NATIONALS WIN
LISTLESS GAME
FROM AMERICANS
Fraser If Found Hard and

He Receives Is Uncertain
Mertes' Long Home Run Hit
and Van Haltren's Good
Work Are the Features
"Tiu" O'Neill's National Leaguers made
Â»he treat Ail-American troupe of baseball
?tars look like a bunch of schoolboys
â¢who missÂ«d their Christmas dinner yes
terday at the Recreation grounds. The
game was a listless, half-hearted affair in
which none of the performers seemed to
take an active part. When the agony did
end the regular "fans" heaved a sigh of
relief and aimlessly wandered homeward
without having received the worth of
their two-bit piece which they handed in
at the box office. The great Lajoie waa
suffering from an overdose of Christmas
delicacies and Winnie Mercer essayed to
do a few stunts around the middle sack.
The Nationals scored six runs in the
initial inning on five hits, a couple of er
rors and a batsman hit. In the next
the bell rang on the arrival of
Mertes and Beckley, who had made the
rounds on a few errors and a wild pitch,
neither making a hit. In the fourth "San
dow" Mertes did the most lively act of
the game by swatting the sphere into the
back yards of Ninth street for a round
trip. The hit was one of the longest ever
seen on the grounds, easily clearing the
left field fence. In the saine inning Heck
ley hit and arrived at the pan on an er
lor and McHale's hit. The Nationals put
the finishing touches on their heavy
etick-work in the eighth when Carr and
8teinfeldt got to Fraser for a pair of dou
bles and both scored.
The Ail-Americans made their first run
In the second when Bradley drew a pass
and finished his trip on lrwin's two-cush
ion swipes. Barrett, Bernard. Mercer and
Davis made the last runs of the Ameri
cans in the fifth, aided by a few well
pinched hits and a couple of misplays.
IFfter that they could not' damage
fcchmidt'e twistÂ«rs to any great extent.
"Saint Jacob" Beckley again made his
bow to the bleachers and tried to shine in
the role of "vice umpire." However, lie
â¢was not as successful as before and did
not seem anxious to take any chances
â¢with "Jim" McDonald. Van Haltren made
a great catch of Sullivan's drive to- the
right centerfield fence In the fourth. It
looked good for two stations, but "Van"
â was there in his old-time form. He was
also handy with the willow, driving out
four safe ones out -of live times at bat.
McHale also had his batting -suit on, do

DELANEY LOOKING FOR
MATCH FOR JEFFRIES
Will Accept First Comer and Fight
Will Take Place in" San
Francisco. - â 
â y CHICAGO, L>ec. 27.â Billy Delaney, man
ager of James J. Jeffries, arrived in the
city to-day. He is bound for New York
â¢with the object of Inducing some of the
leafiinsr heavyweights to try their luck
with Jeffries. Delaney eaid:
"Every possible inducement will be of-
fered Flt_Ei_unons to dra.w him, into an
other match with Jeffries. Bob Is the
man the public is most anxious to have
tackle the champion. I don't know
whether he has retired for good or not.
One hears so m_ny contradictory stories
that It is impossible to tell which is false
and which Is true. If he does not want to
fight again he has a perfect right to stay
out of the came. All he has to do Is to
tell me bo a_d we shall not trouble him
further.
"I have made arrangements to hold a
â¢ort of reception in New York next Mon
day afternoon. All of the leading heavy
weights or their representatives â will be
requested to attend and make bids for a
fight with Jeffries. I don't mean to play
any favorites and the man that gets his
forfeit money for a match down first will
be Jeffries' next opponent
"Madden will have to look elsewhere
for a match on behalf of I>enver Ed
Martin. While Jeffries does not draw the
color line Btrictly. yet he refuses to box
a negro for the championship.
"Whoever Jeffries may be matched with
â¢the contest will undoubtedly take place at
San Francisco. It is the only locality
trhere a bijer fight can be brought off in
absolute safety."

Griffin-Johnson Fight Results
in a Draw and Long Gets
the Decision Over Curren
There were three good boxing contests
at the Reliance Club, Oakland, last even-
Ing, but little of the lively fighting which
has characterized recent tournaments
held in the gymnasium of that organiza
tion. The main event,. a fifteen-round con
test between Hank Griffin of Los Angeles
and Jack Johnson of Denver resulted in
a draw.
The big colored fighters were both in
splendid condition. Johnson proved him
selt a clever Infighter. Both men did some
hard hitting, but there was little of par
ticular interest in the bout. As far as
giving and taking punishment were con
cerned honors were about evenly divided,
but Griffin did most of the leading and
seemed to be tl\e cleverer of the two. The
Judges' decision seemed to give general
satisfaction.
Jockey Bennett was awarded the deci
sion in the first preliminary, a six-round
pro with Jack McPadden. Bennett slipped
in the fourth round.- fell and fractured his
right wrist. In spite of his injury, how
ever, he stayed in the battle, and in the
last two rounds, one-handed as he was,
administered to McFadden a course â  of
punishment .which had him on. the verge
of slumberland several times.
Dr.-Crowley examined the jockey's wrist
after the fight and pronounced the injury
a serious fracture. Although the specta
tors did not know the extent of the dam
age its seriousness was manifest when the
boxer's right hand was seen to be flap
ping around like a broken wing.
Louie Long was given the decision over
George Curren in a ten-round mill. The
decision was approved by all but Curren,
who wanted to whip the referee, and
managed to escape from his seconds long
enough to make the announcement that
he could knock the block off Louie Long
any day In the week and that all judges
were liars. In the absence of "Billy"
Jordan, who â was reported indisposed, Sec
retary Walter B. Fawcett made a star hit
as announcer. Ed J. Smith refereed the
Griffin-Johnson fight. The attendance
was large. . .- .
THE ROYAL FAMILY OF
â¢ EUROPE IN DANGES
Too Much Intermarrying Produces
Results That Threaten the Ex
istence of Some Houses.
Justin McCarthy in the ' Independent
says: We hear the most alarming antici
pations about the health of the King. The
report Is going about everywhere, and it
finds some sanction in the fact that the
King has lost within a comparatively
short space of time a brother and a sis
ter from the fell disease which, according
to nopular rumor, he believes to be threat
ening his own life. Three of the late
Queen Victoria's children died during Vic
toria's lifetime, and one other, the late
Queen's eldest daughter, widow of the
late German Emperor Frederick, died
only a few months after the death of her
mother.
An interesting- article which I have just
been reading in the Dublin Freeman's
Journal, the leading- newspaper of Ireland,
insists that one main cause of the . ill
nesses which at present affect so many
royal houses of Europe is to be found in
the fact that "the sovereigns of Europe
have disregarded that great law of nature
which discountenances the marriages of
near blood relations." The article goes on
to tell us that while "there are in Europe
over a score of Emperors, Kings, and
minor reigning sovereigns â¢ â¢ â¢ all but
two are the descendants of James I of
England, the only child of the marriage
of Darnley and Mary, Queen of Scots."
The King of Sweden, who, as everybody
knows, is the descendant of Marshal Ber
nadotte, one of the soldiers whom the
great Xapoleon raised from the ranks
and set upon a throne, and the Prince
of Montenegro, who became a sovereign
ruler within the recollection of us all, are
almost the only exceptions. The result ot
this condition of things naturally is that
European Princes and Princesses are com
pelled to marry "in and in," if I may use
that colloquial expression â when dealing
with such a subject â in other words, have
to flnd their marriage consorts in families
more or less nearly related to their own.
At present there is hardly a European
imperial or royal family which is not op
pressed by serious and boding illness of
some kind, and It is only reasonable to say
that some explanation of this fact may be
found in this system of intermarriage. It
is certainly a curious historical fact that
the dynasty of the Stuarts, in many ways
the worst dynasty that ever ruled over
England, should have left so many de
scendants among the reigning house of
Europe.
DEATH STATISTICS OF
THE GREAT CIVIL WAR
Grand Total Reaches 304,000, or
About One in Every Nine
Men Enlisted.
The campaigns and battles of the Civil
War were on a Bcale of surpassing mag
nitude. Therft were more than a score of
single battles, sometimes extending over
several days. In each of which the losses
in killed and wounded on the Federal side
were greater than the aggregate of all
our losses in all our other wars combined.
How paltry seem the 6000 killed and
wounded in the war of 1812, or the war in
Mexico, or the war with Spain, compared
with the 14.000 at Shiloh, 15,000 at the
Chickahominy, 13,000 at Antietam, the
same at Fredericksburg, 16,000 at Chan
cellorsviUe, 23,000 at Gettysburg:, 16,000 at
Chlckamauga, 37.000 in the Wilderness and
26,000 at Spottsylvania! The grand aggre
gate of destruction fairly staggers the
imagination, accustomed as we have been
for more than a generation to the figures
â93,000 killed by bullets, 186,000 killed by
disease, 25,000 dead from other causesâ
a grand total of 304,000, about one in nine
of every man who wore the uniform.
In no other war in all time has such re
spect been paid to the dead. Immediately
after its close the Secretary of War was
directed by Congress "to secure suitable
burial places and to have these grounds
enclosed, so that resting places of the
honored dead may be kept : sacred for
ever." In seventy-nine separate and dis
tinct national cemeteries the bodies of
nearly 300,000 soldiers who died during the
Civil War are interred, and the decora
tion of their graves with flowers on a fixed
day has become a national custom. Some
of the cemeteries contain each a silent
army of over 10,000 soldiers, in serried
ranks marked by the white headstones,"
on nearly half of which is inscribed "un
known." The world may be searched in
vain for anything similar or kindred;
there is no other such Impressive sight.
LITTLE GIRL'S EFFOBT
TO BEFORM POLICEMEN
Offers Prize of One Dollar to One
With Minimum Scores for
Profanity.
The Chicago papers tell of a little eight
year-old girl who is* trying to reform the
Oak Park policemen. She has sent $1 in
small change to the station with the
statement that it is to be awarded as a
prize to the policeman who uses the few
est profane words between date of receipt
and Christmas. Each officer is to report
his profanity score every evening at roll
call on his honor as an officer and a g-en
tleman. In her note the little miss said she
hoped to make the Oak Park policemen
better than their Chicago brethren. The
guardians of the peace have accepted the
challenge in good faith. A book has been
purchased and the record will be kept
therein in black and white. Verily "a
little child shall lead them." That little
girl's dollar will do more good than a
thousand lectures in the Oak Park pre
cinct.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1901.
PASSING THE WIRE NOSE AND NOSE
BEDECK AND QUADRA RUN A DEAD HEAT
Duckoy, Well Piloted by Lee; J^
Titaniaâ Cuban Girl Given jf Stiff Argumetp-lBy El
Fonseâ -Bassenzo First at 10 to l---UrGhin|Fakes^|iÂ§|irse
Dâ IMINUTIVE Willie Knapp on the
two-year T old filly Quadra, carry
ing 89 pounds, made a dead heat
of if with Winnie O'Connor,
astride the favorite Bedeck, j in
the mile selling run yesterday at Oakland.
The older horse had been showing signa
of lameness in his work, for which reason
6ome of the books went to 11 to 10 to get
the coin in. Besides Quadra three other
two-year-olds started in the race," and
Bedeck was badly outfooted the first
quarter. Going around the bunch, O'Con
nor had worked hi& way up on nearly
equal terms with Quadra and everybody
had the result figured out. But the pre
cocious youngster on the leader did not
intend to give up, without a battFe, and
drawing his whip went to work on Qua
dra. Seventy '"yards from the finish Be
deck was nearly a neck to the good, then
Knapp gave Quadra another cut or two
until as the pair passed the wire the
judges were, unable to separate them.
The purse was divided. Johnny Daly, on
Sir Lewis, was a close third.
None of the fields possessed much class,'
but they served to attract quite as large
a crowd as usual. Cuban Girl and Mis
sion were the only favorites to land.
Probably Green Morris' Duckoy was re-,
sponsible for furnishing the biggest sur
prise of the afternoon. Down near the
bottom of the card, a. six-furlong spin
looked a good thing for Princess Titania
with 90 pounds and Redfern in the saddle,
and the filly ruled an 8 to 5 favorite. It
looked rosy for the first choice after she
had collared Hilee in the stretch, when
Lee Jackson slid along on the rail with
the 95 pounder Duckoy, beating the Prin
cess out a neck Inl:-^. At ope time the
winner was 10 to 1 in the ring.
Master Redfern, on the 9 to 1 chance,
Urchin, had his number displayed first
after the Jinish of the opening scramble
at five and a half furlongs.- Always in. a
good position the gelding downed Marl
neuse, another outsider, a length. Gold
finder led the favorite Kasp out lor show
honors, the latter being a slow beginner.
Bassenzo, a 10 to 1 shot from the staDle
of Walter Jennings, ran away with the
maiden two-year-old event. The Basset
law gelding made all the running and won
hands- down. Montana Peeress on' her
last race was installed favorite and under
Tommy Burns', hard riding beat Rosarie
half a length for the place.
The lead of the "Oregon short-liner,"
Patsy Dolan, out in front in the five and
a half furlong dash, third to be decided,
was short lived. The aged bush mare led
to the stretch after starting favorite and
then became lost inline shufHe. Tommy
Burns hustled Cuban Girl, a 6 to 1 chance,
along and in a busy finish got the decision
from El Fonse by a neck. Chappie, at 15
to 1, ran third.
Not much class could be attached to
any one of the seven starters in the clos
ing mile and fifty yard run. Mission went
to the post favorite and owing to Bull
man's riding led out Einstein a length.
Kastaine ran third.
Track Notes.

Ned Lanigan has issued a handsome
printed pamphlet extolling the good qual
ities of his fine looking horse Rubicon.
Winnie O'Connor will take a week's
vacation up at the Haggin ranch after to
day.
Urchin, winner of the first race, was
bid up from $200 to $300 and was obtained

BANKRUPTCY LAW
Commercial Men Reply
to Inquiries on the
Subject.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Deo. 27.â The
executive committee of the National As
sociation of Bankruptcy Trustees has pre
sented to Congress its report on the in
vestigation made to secure the sentiment
of all sections of the country on the na
tional bankruptcy law. The committee
sent out 13,968 ' inquiries. The committee
summarises its report as follows:
. The actual result of our investigation ap
pears to clearly demonstrate the following sa
lient facts:
That there is an almost unanimous sentiment
throughout the country and among the leading
commercial Interests thereof. . favoring a uni
form and national bankrupt law.
That sentiment appears to exist to a like
extent, preferring a national system of bank
ruptcy to State Insolvency systems.
That there also appsars to be a consensus
of opinion among, those best qualified to pass
upon the questions that the present law needs
amendment in several Important directions. â 
That the amendments contained in the Ray
bill appear to have received the favorable ap-.
proval of the moat important commercial ele
ments of the country.
That concerning the questions involved in
section 57 G of the present act, arising by
reason of the construction given to such section
by the courts, attention should be given to the
matter by Congress in the direction of en
deavoring to adjust if possible the various
interests involved and affected.

The Large Growth of Suburbanism.
It was not many years ago that people
lived in the suburbs as a matter of eco
nomy. Now they live in these parts be
cause higher â¢ ideals ' may often be at
tained here. From reports personally ob
tained from twenty-eight of the largest
cities in America, north, south, east and
west, it was shown that during two re
cent years over $420,000,000 had been in
corporated and spent in private pur
chases and the development of lands.ad
jacent to large cities, for suburban oper
ations. Over $60; 000, 000 â¢ haa been voted
and spent by trolley and railroad compa
nies to extend their services beyond the
limit of these cities. . Nearly half a bil
lion of dollars has, therefore, been in
vested within two years in the proposed
development of suburban properties, in
addition- to the millions of dollars al
ready invested./
Torpedo Tubes Losing Favor.
Torpedo tubes are eliminated from the
plans of the two. battleships and the two
armored cruisers adopted by the Naval
Board of Construction. The board con
cludes that the proper craft from which
to launch a torpedo is the submarine or
surface torpedo-boat, not the large fight
ing ships. It has been contended by many
naval authorities that for a torpedo to
prove effective it is essential that it be
fired at short range, and that the vessel
sending it must be able to get quickly
away from the enemy's big battery. The
board seems to accord with these views
by abandoning the torpedo tube as a part
of the equipment of. the larger war ves
sels. â  ". " \ ' t
The Forth .bridge is constantly being
repainted. So vast i3 the, structure that
it takes fifty tons of paint to give It one
coat, and the area dealt with is some
thing, like 120 acres.

RAILWAY CLAIMS
HEAVY DAMAGE
English Company^rSues
â¢ Society of Railway |;j
Employes^ -
LONDON, Dec. 27.â In the suit of the
Taff Vale Railway against the Amalgam
ated Society of Railway Servants; an im
portant trades union case, the plainillts
filed a statement to-day claiming Â£24,626
damages suffered through an alleged con
spiracy and unlawful combination. The
plaintiffs' claim (which is based on the
House of Lords' decision "of July last,
holding that it was not the intention of
the Legislature to prevent a trades union
from being sued If through its officers it
is guilty of illegalities) is against Richard
Bell, member of Parliament for Derby and
general secretary of the ..Amalgamated
Society of Railway Servants, and against
the trustees of the society, as well _g
against the society itself. ; :
The House of. Lords on July 22 last re
versed the decision of the appeal court
dissolving the injunction rendered August
30, 1900/ by Justice Farwell in the High
Court of Justice, which enjoined officials
of the Amalgamated Society of Railway
Servants from "watching and besetting"
the Great "Western Railway stations- and
approaches with a view to inducing non
unionists to refrain from taking the
places of strikers. That action of the
House of Lords restored Justice Farwe II' s
judgment, the House holding; as set forth
in the cable dispatch, that it was not the
intention of' the Legislature to prevent a
trades union from being sued if through
its officers it is guilty of illegalities.

MUSTACHE A . L'EMPEBETJIt
. NOT XAISEB'S INVENTION
Design of Behren Strasse Barber and
Introduced by One Adjutant
' Hullen.
The Kaiser's mustache has been a popu
lar subject of discussion ever since he
adopted the extraordinary I fashion in
which he now wears itâ turning sharp
right angles upward at the ends of his
upper lip and running parallel -with his
nose until it reaches his eyelashes. It was
the invention of â¢ a ' barber named Haby,
who for a time was an object of almost
as much curiosity â  as the Emperor him
self. In 1887 Adjutant von Hullen, one at
the dudes of the army, appeared at the
palace with the ends of his mustache
turned upward in fan-shape style.
. "Who did it?" inquired the Emperor.
"Haby, a barber on Behren strasse,"
was the reply.
"I wonder if he could fix mine that
way?"
"I have no doubt, your Majesty."
"Send him to me," said the Kaiser, and
on the following day all Berlin was ex
cited over a startling change in the facial
aspect of . the sovereign. Haby became
famous, like the gourd that grew in a
night, and everybody followed the new
fashion, from the field marshals of the
army to the laborers on the highways.
Ninety per cent of the male population of
Germany endeavored to turn their mus
taches so that they would point to the
stars like the horns of a Texas steer.
Haby made the most of his opportunities.
He enlarged his shop, which is in the cen
ter of the cafe district, and hired a dozen
additional barbers, whose chief business
was to train the mustaches of military
men. Haby himself spent most of his
time with his imperial patron, accompa
nying him upon all his journeys, because
to properly train a mustache in the way
it should go requires assiduous attention.
He accompanied the imperial party to the
Holy Land and visited England, Russia,
Austria and Constantinople in the impe
rial retinue. He received several decora
tions which made him dizzy, and when he
got the "big head"- the Emperor dismissed
him. Haby is still living upon his former
glory and his mustache "a l'empereur"
still survives. He has adopted it as a
trademark, and the motto upon his es
cutcheon, as it were, Is the remark made
by his imperial master when' he arose
from the barber's chair and looked in the
glass: . â  â¢
"Es 1st erreicht" ("It is accomplished").
All the barbers In Germany have since
learned, the trick, . even three' patronized
by the laboring classes, where one can get
a shave for only 2% cents, but tourists
always go to Haby's Just as they visit the
palace at Potsdam or the art gallery.
INTEMPERANCE IN OUR. OWN
COUNTRY AND IN EUROPE
The United States Ranks Lowest Per
Capita in Use of Wine and
Spirits.
The good people who are rather inclined
to indulge in horrifying statistics con
cerning the bibulousness of their fellow
Americans would do well to study some
figures recently given out by the British
Board of Trade. Like all similar exhibits,
this one is but approximate, of course,
although the distinguished source whence
it emanates is a guaranty of its substan
tial accuracy. It gives the annual per
capita consumption, of intoxicating bever
ages by the four leading nations, reckoned
in gallons, as follows:
Wine. Beer. Spirits.
United Kingdom 30 31.7 1.12
France 24.04 6.2 2.02
Germany 1.45 27.5 1.&4
United States 33 13.3 ' LOG
It thus appears that as a people the
Americans compare very favorably In
temperance matters with the people of
Europe. We drink less wine than any
one of the other nations appearing in the
table and in none of them save France is
the consumption of beer as small as with
us. But FrancÂ© drinks 24.04 gallons of
wine per capita to our paltry .33 gallon.
Placing wine and beer in the same cate
gory our showing from a temperance
standpoint becomes very favorable, being
only 13.63 gallons, as compared with 30.24
gallons in France.
It has been persistently asserted by peo
ple of all shades of temperance .views that
it is in the matter of strong drinks that
the American is the chief sinner, and yet
the statistics show that more spirits are
consumed per capita by England, Frajice
and Germany than in the United States,
and it must be remembered that it is a
conservative English authority that
places England at the head of the list
and this country at the bottom. But per
haps the whole truth appeals more vividly
to the eye when the per capita consump
tion of all classes of liquors is summar
ized as .follows: * ,*v-
United Kingdom 83.21 gala
France S3.8 gals!
Germany so.89 gals.
United States 14.69 gata
It is not exactly reassuring to know
that we drink an amount of liquor in this
country equal to over fourteen gallons
every year for each of the population, but
certainly there is reason for congratula
tion In the fact that this is less than
half of what is used in either England,
France or Germany.
OUR VOTING POPULATION"
AND MILITIA STRENGTH
Census Shows That One Man Out of
Every Three Refrained From.
Voting in 1900.
The population report issued by the
Census Bureau shows that there are in
the United States and Territories 21,320 819
males of voting age. Of militia age tje
number is some 5,000,000 less.
This does not mean that over 16 000 000
citizens of the United States are capable
of bearing arms. Probably not over two
thirds of the men in this country be
tween 18 and 45 years old would pass a
surgeon's examination in a recruiting or
draft office. But even 10,000,000 men would
form a safe army of defense if the coun
try should be attacked from any quarter
or from all quarters at once.
While the males of yoting age In the
country number over 21,000,000, there w*>re
but 14,000,000 votes cast at the Presidential
election of 1900. The voting populatioa of
the Territories, which do not participate
in a Presidential election, is not over ''00
000. So it appears that only about a two
thirds vote was cast.
Only 14,000,000 out of 21,000,000 voters
went to the polls, leaving 7,000,000 non
voters among the population of votuur
age. The suppressed colored vote at th-Â«
South may amount to 1.500.000 or 2.000 iX>0_^
probably not as much as the larger num
ber. Allowance is also to be made for un
naturalized aliens and the Chinese over 21
years old. But with all these deductions
it is evident that 4,000,000 or 5.000.000 citi
zens of the United States of voting &kb
and qualified by law do not go to the
polls. ' â¢;' I
"FITZ" MAY MEET
JEFFRIES HERE
NEXT FEBRUARY
Australian Boxer Is Said to
Have Given His Promise
to Again Enter the Ring
President Kennedy of Twen
tieth Century Club the Man
Who Controls the Big Match
Manager "Jack" Gleason of the Twen
tieth Century Athletic Club has received
word from President J. C. Kennedy
which insures that organization's contin
uance in the boxing game next season.
More than that, it seems assured Cham
pion Jeffries will again be seen in the
ring here in February and that the man
who will oppose him will be Robert Fltz
simmons, it being asserted that the latter
has promised to enter the ring again.
"Fitz" and Kennedy are frxenas of long
standing and the boxer has before this
placed bis fighting engagements In the
hands of the rotund manager, In
whom "Fitz" has implicit confidence.
The ex-champion was to have received
$40,000 once for a fight with "Jim" Hall-
All he got out of it was $4000, and he has
been overcautious since then in bis deal
ings with fight-promoting clubs.
"Fitz" has repeatedly said he was out
of the game, and the developments of the
next few weeks will be watched with in
terest Jeffries is due in New York, and
once he arrives the air will probably ba
full of flgto talk.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
match Gardner and Root next month it
its license is renewed. Both men have
expressed themselves as anxious for tha
meeting and It will be a pleasure to Alex
Greggains to accommodate them.
Art Simms, the lightweight, is expected
back next month and may fight "Jimmy"
Britt before the Acme Club, Oakland.

A DEPARTMENT OF MINES
A BILL for an act creating the pepartment of
Mines and Mining, and providing for a Sec
retary thereof who shall be a member of the
Cabinet, has been introduced in the House by Hon.
S. D. Woods of this State. The number of this bill
is House file Xo. 7195, and those who address mem
bers in its behalf should refer to it by that number.
The bill provides for a Secretary of Mines and an
Assistant Secretary, both of course to be appointed
by the President. The bill transfers to the new de
partment all existing scientific bureaus which relate
to the subject of mining, including in terms the
Geological Surve3-, which now has no logical loca
tion in any existing department of the Government.
A special bureau is created to acquire and dissemi
nate special, practjeal information on the subject of
mining, and the director of the Geological Survey is
made the head thereof.
The jurisdiction, control and management of all
mineral lauds is transferred to the new depart
ment from the Department of the Interior, and all
legal matters pertaining thereto follow this transfer.
Patents to mineral lands will come through the Sec
retary of Mines, which will be a great improvement
in view of the provoking delays in issuing such
patents by the General Land Office.
The Call has long advocated the creation of such
a department and Cabinet office, and gives to this bill
its influence and support, in the belief that it is a step
forward for the West which carries with it the whole
country.
The United States has the greatest variety of valu
able metals and minerals found associated in any
part of the world. We have hitherto called the roll
of these as found in California alone. The annual
value yielded by American mines is so stupendous as
to invite every encouragement of the industry which
produces it. In i860 we exported only $999,465 of
the products of our mines. In 1900 that export had
risen to $37,843,742. Only Louisiana, Oklahoma and
the District of Columbia are reported as having no
mines or quarries. The product of the mines of the
country for 1900 was $1,291,291,579. This value at
the mine expands almost immeasurably in the case
of copper, iron and other metals as they pass through
the various processes which adapt them to use.
No other country has such wealth in its mines and
quarries, and no other country gives as little protec
tion and encouragement to mining. Mr. Woods' bill
proposes to do tardy justice to this great interest
and should become a law before this session closes.
It is noted that although Charles Emory Smith has
long been a live newspaper man he did not let his
paper have a scoop on the news of his resignation
of the Postmaster Generalship. It is believed that
his conduct in that regard is the finest exhibition of
official conscience ever made in Washington.
With a surplus in the treasury, a surplus in the
balance of trade and a surplus of revenue, Uncle Sam
can hardly be expected to watch the boys in Co;i
gress too closely when they make up the appro
priation bills this winter.
if the committee appointed by the New York con
ference does one-half as much good as its sanguine
supporters predict in the direction of settling dis
putes between labor. and capital, we will count it as
the best gift the Christmas season has brought us.
Having paid the bill for damages due to Ameri
cans, the Sultan of Turkey has ordered all naturalized
Americans to leave his dominions; not, it seems,
with any intention of getting even this time, but to
avoid damages in the future.' _â¢.
Now that the Pan-American convention has agreed
to co-operate with The Hague court in arranging
for international arbitration, the thing may be re
garded as having settled itself for a good quiet time.

OUR FRUIT FIGURES.
. â  â  . : -
CALIFORNIANS who travel have noted that
in the Eastern "States nearly every town of
2000 inhabitants upward to the great cities
has its '"California fruit store." As the towns get
larger the number of such stores increases, in some
cases being numbered like national banks. In the
great cities are many elegant places under that sign,'
where our fruit of 'all kinds is repacked in such, a
way as to exhibit to best advantage its form . and
color. In this holiday time our grapes, the white
and black cornichon, the great queen and the Tokay,
may be seen arranged together in baskets so as best
to display their contrasting colors and looking de
licious enough to tempt an anchorite. '
The universality of the name of California over
fruit stores means that we have captured the domes
tic market and made every Eastern dealer our adver
tising agent. It means that we are without a rival
in the production of fruit and that we need not fear
a failure of the market if we practice commercial
honor in furnishing the supply. It means also that
our railway lines must be admonished by the unfor
tunate experiences of last season, which are now,
being repeated, and must be equipped to carry this
crop promptly, quickly and in good condition from
the producer to the consumer. Surely it is odious
that the Eastern holiday market shall be reaching
for our fine oranges which arc rotting under the
trees for lack of cars to carry them! The railroads
must expect to prepare for the moving of this fruit
crop, which is going to market every month in the
year, just as Eastern roads equip themselves to move
the grain and coal and iron of the States which. pro-
duce them.
Wc have heretofore used the excellent report of
General Chipman. president of the State Board of
Trade, to show the variety and value of our fruit
crop. This information is now supplemented by
bulletin No. 23 of the miscellaneous service of the
Agricultural Department, prepared by Statistician
Holmes, a field agent of the bureau. He has visited
every county in California and laboriously collected
statistics that may not be found collated elsewhere
than in his report. He reports that in 1900 there were
in the State 16,192,876 bearing fruit trees and 13,209,
411 non-bearing, in new orchards, making a total of
trees, occupying 452,252 acres.
I Of the total number 8,072.843 were prune trees.
1 5.521,967 teach. 3,652,454 orange, 2,744.910 apricot
land 2.162,740 olive.
I There were 216,066 fig trees and 905.742 lemon,
24,460 pomelo, 1,603.485 almond and 535,/6i walnut.
Grapes occupy the greatest area, I57Â»ooo acres, and
prunes are next with 104,666 acres; peaches are third
with 80,029 acres, and the orange fourth with 52,
934 acres.
Mr. Holmes is not only a statistician, but a horti
culturist a? well, and his report shows that while he
counted trees and vines and acres he closely observed
physical conditions in the light of their adaptation to
the various fruits. Of the citrus fruits, including the
orange, lemon, lime and pomelo, he says: "Much
of the land of the State is adapted to the cultivation
of citrus fruit, and while by far the greater portion of
the commercial crop of the State is at present grown
in Southern California, fruit of this character can be
safely and profitably grown all along the foothills of
the Sierra Nevada Mountains, from San Diego to
Tehama County, a distance of over 700 miles. This,
area is a thermal belt, and varies in width from three
to thirty miles. The mean summer temperature in
this belt is higher in the northern than the southern
part, and in the winter is higher in the southern
than the northern. The mean temperature for the
entire year, however, does not vary more than four
degrees throughout the whole belt."
Here we have the first official statement of the
physical reason for the fact that the Northern Cali
fornia oranges, grown almost in the latitude of Chi
cago, ripen and "go into market two months earlier
than the Southern California crop. It is because of
the greater heat in the summer, when the fruit is
growing and maturing. This also accounts for the
greater earliness of all stone fruits in Northern Cali
fornia.
Dealing with the distribution of the fruit trees, he
reports that in 1898 Northern California had of all
kinds, bearing and non-bearing, 19,171,506 and
Southern California 8,367,193. Of the bearing trees
Northern California had 77.3 per cent and Southern
California 22.7 per cent. The non-bearing trees wef$
more equally distributed, the north having 57.2 per
cent and the south 48.8 per cent, showing that plan
tations are being extended in Southern
and new land is being brought into actiptv fcf<VJ
He finds that in 1900 there were .87,990 tons of
green fruit shipped out of the State' fcom, Northern
and 198 tons from Southern California Northern
California also shipped 164,795 tons ,of, dried and
canned fruits and raisins, against 10,235' tons ' from
the south. But in citrus fruits proportions . are re
versed, Southern California shipping .218,183. tons,
against 8273 tons from the north. ; 'The total ,ship
ments of all kinds stood, according to Mr. Holmes,
at 261,058 tons from Northern California and 228,418
tons from the south, making the magnificent total
for the whole State of 489,476 tons- of fruit, the
product of 452,252 acres, or, more strictly' speaking,
of 16,192,876 trees, since the above acreage, was also
occupied by 13,209,411 non-bearing young trees. The
bearing trees being 55 per cent of the whole, the
bearing acreage was also 55 per cent, so that 248,738
acres produced 489,476 tons of fruit of all kinds and
conditions for export to a market outside the State,
or one ton and eight-tenths of a ton per acre. This
of course is in addition to our very large home con
sumption. This is a land of fruit and flowers, and
Californians cat the one and wear the other in
greater abundance than any other people, so it is
quite safe to put the fruit yield at-2j^ tons per acre.
It is a great industry and needs more and more
every, year the study and attention ; of those who
handle the commercial end of it. The producer is
already learned in horticulture, which here rises to
the rank of a learned profession.
AMERICA TO EUROPE.
DURING a single week preceding Christmas
three trans-Atlantic steamers that left New
York for Europe carried with them 102,265*
postal money orders, having an aggregate value of
$1,888,349. It is believed that the most of the money
was intended as Christmas gifts. In addition to the
postal. orders there were an unusually large number
of registered mail parcels carried by the same steam
ers. A single one of them, the Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse, carried no less than 20,120 registered pieces.
As many of the registered parcels and letters also car
ried Christmas gifts to the old country, it will be seen
that America's remembrance of Europe kept Santa
â¢ Claus busy over there before he crossed the ocean to
our own shores. ''i'-lvH
A detailed statement of the postal orders of. the
THE SAN ..-FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 19O1.
week shows that of the total amount of money sent
to Europe $556,000 went to Great Britain and Ireland,
$216,000 to Germany, $110,000 to Sweden, $70,000 to
Italy, $42 000 to Russia, $38,000 to Hungary, $32,000
to Norway, $23,000 to Switzerland, $19,000 to France,
$16,000 to Denmark, $8500 to Belgium and the Neth
erlands and $230 apiece to Egypt and Portugal.. The
Italian orders averaged highest, namely, $25 68 each,
and the Danish and Dutch the leastâ $9 05 and $9 80.
Of course the postal orders and registered letters
"and packages do not by any means represent all the
Christmas cheer that went from us to Europe in the
shape of 'valuable gifts. The postoffice carries money
only when sent in comparatively small sums. When
the amount exceeds fifty dollars it is nearly always
sent through the banks instead of through the post
office. Consequently it is probable that most of the
money in those 102,265 orders, averaging as they did
but $11 62 each,, was sent by people of comparatively
small incomes and did not include any of the gifts
which the more prosperous , and richer Americans
sent to their friends and relatives across the sea.
Uncle Sam, then, has been a veritable rich uncle
for the boys and girls and old folks across the ocean.
â He- lias-given liberally to make -Christmas gay for
them and profitable for their traders in Christmas
goods. Fortunately he is rich enough- to stand the
strain, and besides he has the satisfaction of knowing
that the balance of trade in his favor will bring him '
his money back again and more with it long before
the coming of next Christmas, when he will once
more help to fill the European, stocking.

CUBA'S first -political campaign as a free coun
try does not augur well for the future^ ' It
has already reached a stage that would re
sult in war were not the United States troops present
in sufficient force to prevent an outbreak. As it is
one of the contending parties has announced an in
tention to withdraw its candidates and take no part in
the. election. The reason, assigned for the action is
that the control of the election machinery is in the
hands of the other party and that the candidates of
that party will be counted, in no matter what the
popular vofe may be. â¢
General Maso and his party undertook to contest,
the election of Palma on the ground that Palma does
not truly represent the aspirations of the Cuban
people for complete independence. He is accused of
being too friendly and too: submissive to the United
States. The cry of the Maso men was for "no in
terference." Scarcely had ; they got their campaign
-.veil launched, however, when they discovered that
all the members of the board of scrutiny were sup
porters of Palma. Thereupon they at once ceased
clamoring against American interference and set
about trying to obtain such interference on their
behalf.
In one of the Maso memorials to General Wood it
is stated that the Palma men, not content with
placing their supporters in control of the election
boards, so manipulated the list of persons eligible as
senatorial electors as to prevent the Maso party from
getting suitable candidates for that office. In de
scribing what has occurred in Havana as an illustra
tion, the statement of the Maso memorial alleges
that out of a list of 240 of the heaviest taxpayers
made by the Ayiintamiento, from among whom the
parties have to select candidates for senatorial elect
ors, twenty- five are dead and eighty are foreigners.
A number of the most prominent and wealthy Cu
bans are not included in the list, while the names of
a number of bankrupts . appear. â¢ Many persons
named in the list cannot be identified owing to th,e
incomplete way their names are inscribed.
The offenses charged in the Havana district are said
to be typical of what has beqn committed in the way
of political chicanery throughout the island, and the
United States authorities have been asked to investi
gate them. Any investigation, however, would ne
cessarily entail an interference with the election, and
that is just what the United States intends to avoid.
However, we gain nothing by refusing to interfere,
for the Maso party, finding that we will not help
them, have turned upon us and denounce our Gov
ernment for assisting Palma.
At a recent meeting of the Maso leaders there was
adopted a resolution declaring: "The central board
is a coalition of partisans, and that General Maso,
after exhausting every means to insure impartiality,
rectitude and justice at the coming elections, has be
come convinced that neither in official circles in the
United States nor in Cuba does the intention exist
to see that the elections are carried out with suffi
cient legality to reflect the real wish of the Cubans,
who are desirous of independence and anxious to
elect freely their first constitutional government."
The resolution has been approved by the Maso or
gans. One of them applauds the withdrawal of the
party candidates and says that without the guaran
tees demanded of Secretary Root the election will be
a farce and "a falsification of the will of the people."
It adds: "The Maso coalition should, .not lend
themselves to the betrayal of the public will, and
should not co-operate in a policy which tends to lay
the foundation of the republic in gigantic fraud."
Such being the relations between the two parties
it seems clear that nothing but fear of the. United
States prevents them from fighting. Should Palma
take office and the United States troops be withdrawn
a revolt of the Maso party seems almost certain to
follow. It will then be for the United States to de
cide whether to let the factions fight it out or estab
lish in the island an authority sufficient to keep the
peace permanently. *
A writer in the Westminster Gazette of London
in describing American cities says: "San Francisco
is a thing apartâ the air of the Pacific seems to blow
different impulses on the people, and great and
glorious air, climate and scenery are there, bracing
with the breeziness of the West." Evidently that fel
low has been here.
What with storms off the coast of Washington and
Oregon, blizzards in the mountains and the lake
States, and zero weather along the Atlantic coast, it
appears that California is about the only place in the
Union where the people arc having real good times
in every sense of the phrase. â¢ V
According to Argentine authorities Chile is the
Russia of South America. She always wishes every*
bit of territory that adjoins her own and keeps crowd

territory or a fight.

GROSVENOR SAYS CONGRESS WILL
TAKE CARE OF CHINESE EXCLUSION
Declares That Meetings, Committees and Traveling Hippo
dromes Are Simply So Much Nonsense.
When polling: members of Congress upon the Chinese exclusion act, The Call
addressed a letter among- others to Representative Grosvenor of Ohio, who in re
ply sums up the whole question and exposes the trickery of demagogues in this
emphatic and satisfactory way:
WASHINGTON, Dec 6, 1901.
Correspondent San Francisco Call, City:
Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of December 3, concerning Chinese exclu- *
slon, will say: I am in favor of the extension of the Chinese exclusion act, and
I do not know anybody in Congress who Is not, and I do not know anybody who
has not been in favor of it all the time, and this whole hullabaloo that has been
caused all over the country by a lot of meetings and committees and traveling
hippodromes Is to finally have it said, after it is all over, that "We did it," and
that "It was public pressure that did it." It is all simply so much nonsense.
Congress will take care of the question. There is no doubt about it, and never
has been any doubt about it, and there never was a time when ten members
of either house of Congress were not in favor of it. Yours truly,
C. II. GROSVENOR.

Thqmasville, Ga., "where a. very fervid
colored minister officiated. It Is said that
whenever a lull came in the services the
deacons took up a collection, but through
hospitable motives avoided passing the
box to the white visitors. The old pas
tor arose at last and preached a sermon
that was at the same time eloquent, ear
nest and ridiculous â preaching right at
the white folks, and his description of the
poverty of the church was so impressive
that when the deacons passed the con
tribution boxes around for the third time
Mr. Carnegie intercepted one and dropped
a $50 bill in the box. The boxes were
placed on the pulpit and the old preacher
counted their contents. When he had fin
ished he placed a handful of small change
on one side and a crisp greenback on the
other. Clearing his throat, he said:
"Breddern, we has been greatly blessed

It Is perhaps a little too early to at
tempt any adequate reviev of the sale of
books for the season, but tiiere is an im
pression that this year â will, after all.
compare very favorably witii last, and will
â¢ Indeed prove the best that b^th publishers
! and booksellers have enjoyeil for a long
; time. ' \
Fiction, of course, is responsible for the
bulk of the trade, but it is worth noting
that there have- been really remarkably
â  largf* sales of biographical and historical
; works.
Publishers have not yet. of course, is
sued their spring lists, but from Inquiry
it would appear that numerous arrange
ments have been made.
There promises to be a very heavy out
put of fiction during the early moetha of
the new year. .
Rudyard Kipling will publish * new
book, which, it la said, he has decided
; not to serialize. Jf this means that suc
cessful authors are beginning to feel \hut
the serializing of books tends to injure -
their after sales it may be the beginning
of a rather important development.
Heinemann has secured a new book by
E. P. Benson, called "Scarlet and Hys
sop " two things which are associated in
the Bible with sin. The title, therefore,
suggests that Benson's book deals with
various forms of social wrongdoing.
The same firm will also issue a new
novel called "The Mystery of the Sea,'
by Bram Stoker, Sir Henry Irving's pop
ular manager. Stoker, as usual, has a
supernatural plot. The scene Is laid ia
Scotland, and the heroine is an Ameri
can.
Methuen will issue in the spring novels
by Mrs. L. T. Zade, Mrs. Everard Cotes,
MNs Adeline Sergeant, Cutliffe Hyne,
Benjamin Swift, Weatherby Chesney,
Robert Barr, Bernard Capes. Max Pem
berton and Arthur Morrison.
Messrs. Hutchison have arranged for
the publication, among others, of new
books by Frankfort Moore, "Rita," and
Miss Allen Raine, the Welsh writer,
whose book, "The Welsh Singer," la now
in its eleventh edition.
When Fisher Unwin's list comes out it
will be found to contain a story of. Prince
Rupert, by Charles Steuart, called "A
Lion's Whelp"; a story by Mrs. Alexan
der, called "The Yellow Fiend," and
"Mistress Barbara Cunliffe," by Halll
well Sutcliffe. In this last the writer will
be found to have abandoned for once hia
usual battfelields and? to tell a Yorkshire*
love tale of 1S30.
H: B. Wells is for the moment abandon
ing his scientlllc mood, and the novel on
which he is engaged, is a hjimorous study
of character. r â¢ - -
It is not often that a woman well known
In the higher social World has created

exception. . of Lady . Helen * I Craven and
Lady Ridley, but the Hon. Mrs. Walter
Forbes has earned a great deal of credit
with the novel she has written, callel
"Dumb." Society people are talking
about it on all aides.
Further details are forthcoming about
the "Book of Beauty," which was spokea
of a little while ago. Among the portraits
which will adorn its pages may be men
tioned a new one of Lady Warwick, the

prosperous blacksmith of that place and
formerly a 'driller for the Inter Nos Oil

BLOOD STAINS
POINT TO CRIME
Evidence in an Old House
Probably Explains
Mystery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. c, Dec. 27.-The first
tangible items of evidence of- the supposed
murder in the mystifying case of the
missing Mrs. Powell were disclosed to re
ward the efforts of the searchers to-day
In the deserted bed chamber of a some
what dilapidated cottage perhaps a quar
ter of a mile from the Powell home Spe
cial Searcher Eppinger picked up a small
soft felt Fedora hat, just such a piece of
headwear as Mrs. Powell Is said by her
sister to have worn when she left the
house Thursday afternoon a- week aio
accompanied by the much-sought buyer
and seller of fpoul try stock. There are
wÂ«Â« V 5 f\T op9 nd b I lotchea of congealed
blood on, the outer rim and the hat had
been crushed up in a dusty corner of the
deserted house.
The hat when shown to Powell, the hus
band of the missing woman wks# recog
nized by him as just like that which his
wife had worn. The hat with the tell-tale
blood stains is not the only item of evi
dence presented by this morning's search
however, for in an adjoining dwelling'
also empty for the past several months'
m a collection of spades, shovels axes
and similar working implements, a rusty
garaen sickle was picked up, its edge
darkened by a stain of blood, and adher
ing to it being a human hair, long and
severed apparently by the blow that had
darkened the blade with blood.
A curious circumstance in connection
with the finding of these artic^ej seem
ingly pointing directly to a terrible crime
is found in the fact that when the shack
was searched on Sunday last no such hai.
was there. The room in which it was this
morning found was littered then with
some scattered articles of a. child's aban
doned wardrobe.

FEARING DEATH
Shasta County Farmer

Redding Carpenter Carts the
Box Over the Moun
tains.
Special Dispatch to The Call.'
REDDING, Dec. 27.â Recently this com
munity was amazed to learn that Peter
Scherer, a pioneer and one time rich man
of Redding, had ordered his casket and
deposited a check in favor of the under
taker to cover funeral expenses.
Now the even more surprising an
nouncement is. made that W. Hudson, a
farmer of the Burgess section; . has pre
pared for his own interment even to the
extent of having his coffin made and
brought to his bedside and himself lifted
into it to See that it litted him exactly
as he wished.
Hudson is a man of 48 years, who owns
a good farm in the mountain meadow
lanito. where he resides with his wife and
children. He is an eccentric man, though
he has always been a thrifty one. For
some time he has been I bedridden with
rheumatic trouble. Ho fancies that he
will die during the winter. Heavy snow
isolates the district during the cold' sea
son and the resident Who dies then can
obtain no coflin from Redding.
So Hudson summoned the carpenter,
had his length and â¢ breadth measured
with, u tape as he lay in bed and a coffin
made of pine. The carpenter was in
structed to return with the box as soon
as possible and assist Hudson to "try it
on." Its comfortable dimensions please
its future occupant and the coffin is stored
under the bed, awaiting the fatal winter
day. ; â¢

GRAND JURY CONDEMNS
PRACTICE OF OFFICIALS
Justices and Constables in Fresno
Criticized Because of Bills for
Services.
FRESNO, Dec. 27.â The Grand Jury em
bodied in its report to-day a severe criti
cism of several Justices and constables,
finding that in two townships the re
spective officers are "holding the office
for all they can make out of it." Con
demnation is also expressed for the
"floater" system. In the fifth township
the jury finds that prisoners are conveyed
to the County Jail by team, when the
service could be as expeditiously per
formed by rail at less than one-half the
cost. In the same township outi of 365
cases sentence had been suspended in
205, or in other words "floated" on to the
next town for the next constable and
Justice to enact the same farce over
again.
One hundred and sixty cases were com
mitted to the County Jail. No fines were
collected in any of these cases, and under
the present law the cost to the county
would be over $2000. In the fourth town
ship out of 501 cases looked into 418 were
either dismissed or "floaters" given.
From the remaining eighty-three $142 50
"was collected In fines, and the' constabls
and Justice charges would amount to
over $3000. The jury believes these prac
tices are all wrong and that these bill3
should be cut down to a reasonable
amount. ' "â¢ â¢-,â¢â â  .

California Association
Has Important Work
in View.
â * Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Dec. 27.-Prepara
tions are about completed for the
convention of the California State Teach
ers' Association, which will open here
next Monday. A number of the promi
nent participants in the convention pro
gramme have already arrived and more
are expected to-morrow and ' Sunday.
Among those now on the ground are Su
perintendent Reginald Webster of San
Francisco and Superintendent J. W. Mc-
Clymonds of Oakland.
The coming convention is expected to
be of extraordinary importance to educa
tion in California and for many reasons
will be the most notable meeting ever
held by the association. There is a
movement on foot among some of the
prominent members looking to the adop
tion of a new constitution with a view to
making the association the center of edu
cational interest in the State.
The new plan will, if carried, change
the character of the association very ma
terially, doing away with its present
somewhat temporary character and put
ting it upon a more permanent basis. The
proposed constitution will be formulated
Oy the California Council of Education,
which meets here just prior to the open
ing of the convention, and will probably
be presented to the convention on New
Year's day. It is believed by those best
informed that the question will cause
debate and a lively time is expected, for
while the new idea is generally favored
many members of the organization be
lieve it to be for the best interests of the
association that it retain its present char-
Two other points will make the conven
tion a notable oneâ the presence of three
college presidents, Dr. E. Benjamin An
drews of the University of Nebraska, Dr.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University
of California and Dr. David Starr Jordan
of Stanford University. Between 700 and
800 delegates are expected to attend the
convention. %

Retiring Master Goldaracena
Receives Testimonial
From Fraters.
The recently elected ofScers of the
French Lodge of Free and Accepted Ma
sons, known as La Parfaite Union, were
installed in the Masonic Temple last night
in the presence of nearly all the fraters of
the lodge and several specially invited
visitors. The ceremony, ever beautiful,
was in the French language, and was
very impressive. It was conducted by O.
M. Goldaracena, the retiring master, who
was assisted by Past Master J. M. Dupas
&s marshal of ceremonies. The new of
ficers who are to fill the stations for the
current Masonic year are:
Michel E. Diebold, worshipful master; A.
Huguenln, senior â warden; L. J. Gerhardt,
junior warden; Paul St. Jullien, secretary; P.
BeJgarde, treasurer; O. Bozio, marshal; Eman
uel Meyer, chaplain: A. Cerveau, senior dea
con; Evariste C. Mailhebeau, Junior deacon; IS.
Balnquie and Thomas Seehablague, stewards,
and F. Lagrange, tyler.
Music was rendered during the cere
mony by the Masonic Quartet.
After the officers were seated in their
stations and the marshal nad made decla
ration that they had been duly installed
in accordance with ancient usage, then*
came the presentation to retiring Past
Master Goldaracena of a jewel of the rank
of past master. The presentation was by
Worshipful Master Diebold on behalf of
the lodge, and he declared that the sym
bolical emblem was the offering of all the
members, who took that means of show
ing their appreciation of the very efficient
manner in which the outgoing master had
fulfilled the duties thm were imposed
upon him. The recipient made a feeling
response.
After the close of the lodge the members
and the invited guests went to a rotis
serle, where they partook of an installa
tion supper. Past Master Ooldaracena
was the toast master. The various dainty
dishes having been disposed of, a feast of
oratory followed. Those who were called
upon to respond to the regular toasts
â were: The new master of the lodge, II.
E. Diebold; Senior Warden A. Huguenin;
Junior Warden L. J. Gerhardt; Past Mis
ters Auguste GoustiaiA, J. M. Dupas,
Emanuel Meyer, Victor <3ardet and C". L.
P. Marais.
This lodge, the only one that works in
the French language in this city, is one of
the oldest, having passed the semi-centen
nial mark in 1909. The term just closed
was a remarkably prosperous one. eleven
candidates for Masonic honors having in
that time had the degrees conferred upon
them. It commences the new term with
a membership of one hundred and seven.

FORCE FROM BOARD OF WORKS WARMS
MATTERS UPON COMMITTEE MEETING
Engineer Grunsky and Attorney Gartland Clash With Su
pervisor Reed and All Indulge in Satirical Invective,
and the Sergeant at Arms Is Ordered to Take a Hand
At a meeting of the Public Utilities Commission held yesterday Engineer Grunsky and Attorney
Gartland mixed matters with Supervisor Reed. On the whole the session was a lively one, and while no
definite results regarding- the prospective bond^issue 'were obtained the methods of the Board of .Public Works
were freely criticized. . â¢.. c,-?,.. ?â¢ - ,v. .â¢â¢ "
SIT down, sir!" said Supervisor
Charles Wesley Reed to City En
gineer Grunsky. "Sergeant . at
arms, do your duty."
Then Captain Anderson laid his
hand on the arm of the City Engineer and
he sat down. Attorney Gartland of the
Board of Public Works also ruffled the
dignity aiid aroused the ire of the chair
man of the. Public Utilities Committee : of
the BoarcT'of Supervisors yesterday after
noon and thereby added fuel to the ex
citement that was produced every mo
ment at what proved a gingery meeting
of the committee. The session was a
lively one and while no definite results
were obtained as regards the prospective
bond issue, the methods of the Board of
Public* Works came in for a large share
of criticism.
Some time ago Luther Wagoner, once
employed by the Board of Public Works
to investigate water supplies for San
Francisco, made a. report to the Board
of Public Works regarding the Tuolumne
River as a source of supply. As pub
lished in The Call a few days ago Engi
neer Wagoner reported that the estimat
ed cost of the supply would approximate
$28,000,000. When Engineer Grunsky of
the Board of Public Works submitted his
report the estimated co->t had been raised
to &>8,000,000. Supervisor Reed wanted to
find out how this discrepancy occurred.
In his official capacity as Supervisor
and chairman of the Committee on Pub
lic Utilities he called in the City Engineer
and asked for the report. Reed did not
get it. Then he went back to the board
rooms and caused the clerk of the Board
of Supervisors to serve a subpena to pro
duce the document.
The subpena was served, not on Grun
sky, but on Colonel Mendell, the president
of the Board of Public Works. The Board
of Public Works responded to the sub
pena, also its attorney, Mr. Gartland.
At the time the committee was consid
ering- what propositions would be sub
mitted to the people in the bond/election
to be held in the future. The Supervisors
talked about tie best way to place the
207 gas lamps that are in juxtaposition
to telegraph and electric light and car
poles; they talked about streets and al
leys, and children's playgrounds, and
about buying a park near a proposed site
for a pesthouse. Then the matter of the
Wagoner report loomed up. It came sud
denly, unexpectedly, and vociferously, and
culminated later in the production of the
much wanted document.
Reed Wants the Report.
"I am surprised," said Chairman Reed,
"that in this matter of water works in
vestigation I have net been able to secure
the icport of one of the engineers em
ployed by the city through the Board of
Public Works. I refer to the so called
Wagoner report."
"I refused to give up that report," said
Grunsky, "because I did not think it was
called for in good faith. The report was
incomplete, it was filed by a subordinate,
and was not yet a matter of record. A
document of that* kind is not a public
record and cannot be made the basis of
a bond issue."
"I am sorry you attacked my good
faith," sharply retorted Reed, "as I have
done everything possible to assist you
and your board in the prosecution of this
â¢work. When you -wanted $10,000 about a
year and a half ago I had the board in
crease the amount to $30,000. You brought
Wagoner to my office, introduced him to
PRESIDIO HOP IS ENJOYED
BY A VERY MERRY COMPANY
Last evening -was a gay one at the Pre
sidio, the hop being the attraction for
two hundred guests resplendent in even
ing dress. The number would have been
larger had the floor space permitted it,
but the crush at the last dance made it
necessary for the managers to provide
for some comfort and a little dancing.
Hence the 'chancre.
Much- to the delight of the guests, the
dancin* continued until 1 a. m., instead
of breaking up at 11:30 p. m., the usual
hour. One o'clock will be the regular time
hereafter for the home-going.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of Lieutenant Collins, Lieutenant
Brower and Lieutenant Babcock. Mrs.
Hayden and Mrs. Burgess, who assisted
in receiving, were stylishly gowned. Many
charming debutantes were in evidence.
A few of the guests were; Miss Allen,
Miss Kittle, Miss Blakeman, Miss Salis
bury, Miss Keyes, Miss -Marjorie Gibbons,
Miss Lucie King, the Misses Cheatham,
Miss Herrin, Miss Ethel Cooper, Miss
Huntington, Miss Pearl Landers, Miss
Catherine Robinson, Miss Jean Nokes,
Miss Marie Wilson, Miss Mills, Miss
Charlotte Ellinwood, Miss Moore, Miss
Shorb and Miss McClung.
Les Bon Xmis cotillon last evening in
Golden Gate Hall was a decided success.
Two hundred gayly dressed young people
lent their presence to the affair, and the
scene was a brilliant one. No expense
was spared in decorations and more elab
orate preparations were made than usual.
The balcony wa3 draped in red bunting
and hung with red incandescent lights.
Many flags and satin banners ornamented
the walls, interspersed with wreaths and
bunches of holly. A Christmas tree oc
cupied the center of the stage. Incan
descent lights of all colors were placed
on the tree.
The ceiling was hung with Christmas
berries, evergreens, four large floral bells
and showers of gold. Miss Lee and Miss
FOOTPAD GRABS WATCH
FHOM CLEHK'S POCKET
George Broophe Has His Gold Time
piece Stolen by Daring
Thief.
A footpad accomplished an exceedingly
daring theft late last night on Stevenson
street, between Third and Fourth. The
victim of the bold robber was Geprge
Broophe, a clerk. He was walking down
Stevenson street and was near Third
when the footpad approached and grabbed
his watch and chain. The watch was
pulled from Broophe's pocket, and so vio
lently did the footpad pull that the gold
chain was broken off near where it fasten
ed to the coat.
Broophe was so surprised by the sud
denness of the attack that he did not at
tempt to resist the footpad, who after se
curing the watch started to run up Stev
enson street toward Fourth. Broopho
gave chase and tried to disable the rob
ber by striking him with a heavy cane.
Twice he succeeded in knocking him
down, but each time the robber scrambled
to his feet and continued his flight.
Broophe finally captured him near Fourth
street. He led the footpad back to Third
street anaL was holding him in front of
the Grant drug store waiting to turn him
over to an officer when two men who were
evidently accomplices of the footpad ef
fected his escape. They deliberately
forced their way between Broophe and his
prisoner.
As soon as the robber found himself
free he darted up Stevenson street, still
carrying Broophe's watch. The police ar
rived on the scene' about the time the
footpad made his escape and placed under
arrest one of the men who assisted him
to get free from Broophe. As there was
no ground on which to hold the accom
plice he was subsequently released.

me, told me of his excellent qualifications
and asked: .me. to do everything possible
for him. --During the course of these in
vestigations, L saw much of Wagoner and
his force, .anil told blnirto save for me a
copy of his report." He'told'me he would
have .to return -it first to the Board of
Public Works. : Wagoner told me to put
In my first estimate at ?28,000,000 and then
Grunsky put in his at $38,000,00. , I called
for Wagoner's report as a Supervisor and
when Mr. Grunsky refused It I- demanded
the issuance' of a ' subpena 'from the
Board of ; Supervisors for its ; production.
It is all a, mattei\ of faith in engineers. I
cannot conceal; my chagrin at the attack
made upon my good faith by Mr. Grun
sky, especiallyas I have labored so hard
and so earnestly in this cause: My data
shows that- < a rwater system could be ac
quired for $28, 000,000, yet you claim that
it will -cost 510,000,000, more. â  . . .. , -
Heed Hushes Into Print.
"Mr. "Wagoner did not include $7,000,000
for. a distributing system," responded
Grunsky. â¢â¢"!' sent Wagoner to you as
president of theSierra Club, thinking that
you might know something- about the
water supplies of the high Sierras. Wag
oner exceeded his duty. We kept you pur
posely in ignorance of our plan of cam
paign, because we were afraid you would
rush to the press and bring interminable
litigation on the city before we acquire I
certain water rights. The Mayor advised
us to do this. We invited you to come to
some of our conferences, which were
open, but we did not want you to go
around talking about how .we were goinpr
to do this, that and the other thing. If
you had rushed into print that would have
ended the whole. scheme."
Then came Reed's retort: "You made
the mistake of your life in not taking the
local press into your confidence. Every
little paper in the country was reportiig
your movements. That is why the people
of this city are so. down upon the Board
of Public Worksâ you do not take the peo
ple into your -confidence." ?
"I am only an employe of the Board of
Public Works," meekly answered Grun
sky. . . ,
Attorney Gartland then jumped into the
argument. He said he appeared as at
torney for Colonel Mendell, who had beeu
served with a. subpena.
"By" what authority do you represent
Colonel Mendell?" asked Reed.
"Both by my right as attorney of the
Beard of Public Works and as an at
torney-at-law," said Gartland.
' "By v/hose authority was this subpena
issued?" queried Supervisor Connor.
Reed explained what ne thought were
his duties in the premises when as Super
visor he demanded a public document and
was refused. Colonel Mendell attempted
to explain matters and Gartland and
Grunsky tried to talk at the same time.
Colonel Mendell sat down and Reed
rapped for order.
"Sit down, gentlemen," said Chairman
Reed.
"I want to explain," said Grunsky.
"Sergeant at arms, do your duty," or
dered Reed.
Captain Anderson laid his hand on
Grunsky's shoulder,, but Gartland was in
his chair before his companion. Colonel
Mendell drew a large roll of paper from
his pocket and held, it in his, hand for a
few minutes. He spoke to Reed^ and com
pliments were exchanged between them.
Gartland and Grunsky, though sup
pressed, were not subdued, and exchanged
badinage with Reed at long range.

SKULL FRACTURED BY
; FOURTH-STREET CAR,
Leon Fortoonis Attempts to Cross
Track at Natoma and Is Se
verely Injured.
Leon Fortoonis, a Greek residing at
336^ Sixth street, sustained a severe
fracture of. the skull last night by being
knocked down by electric car No. 557 at
the corner of Fourth and Natoma streets.
He was removed~to the Central Emergen
cy Hospital. He is an elderly man and
his wound is so severe that the doctors
fear he has little chance of recovering. S.
J. Dennis, the motorman, was arrested
and charged with battery pending the re
sult of Fortoonis' injury.
The car was southbound at the time of
the accident. According to Motorman
Dennis* story, Fortoonis attempted to
cross the track directly ahead of the car.
Dennis claims that he rang the bell, but
Fortoonis evidently did not hear. For
toonis was formerly proprietor of a res
taurant. â  .
Sheriff After the Fugitive.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 27.-Sheriff Taylor
is still pursuing the man . who shot Ben
Alcantra and Joseph Alberigi 'at ' Point
Reyes the night before' last. It was â . to
day learned that the man's name is Adel
pho Stefanl. Immediately after the shoot
ing he took advantage of the darkness
and disappeared. To-day Sheriff Taylor
got a clew and is now confident of effect
ing his capture. Stefanl is believed to be
heading toward Howards. This morning
he ate a meal at a ranch house near Mar
shalls. Nothing is known here of, Stefan!
other than that he went to work for Al
berigi about two weeks ago. He is said to
'be blind in one eye.
aside to a remark of Grunsky, "because
of attacks on your administration."
Colonel Mendell laid a countermine on
the table in the shape of the disputed re
port. Reed picked up the bomb before the
fuse had burned any further, and put it
in his pocket, having won out against the
combined forces of the Board of Public
Works.
"Do not let the press get this report,"
said Colonel Mendell. "Not until I get
ready," said Reed, and the armistice was
then declared.
The matter of removing the 207 gas
lamps, whose radiance is subdued by in
tervening electric, lights and telephone
poles, was referred to the Board of- Pub
lic Works. The companies furnishing
lights have agreed to bear a part of the\
expense and some of the lights may be
hung upon the poles that now obstruct
the streets. #
The matter of parks and improvements
in Telegraph Hill and Twin Peaks, was
referred to the Board of Public Works
for. further estimates.
Merchants on Bond Issue.
Frank J. Symmes, president of the Mer
chants' Association, appeared before the
committee to advocate the selection of
some other site than the one under con
sideration for a chilren's playground.
The cost of the lot at Seventh, Harrison
and Bryant streets, with Columbia
Square as a panhandle, has been ap
praised at J234.000. Mr. Symmes advocat
ed the selection of a strip between Clem
entina and Tehama street, in one of the
blocks embraced between Third and Sixth
streets. He estimated the cost? on an
appraised valuation of $295,000. He thought
"this would eliminate the disagreeable
features of these streets."
"How wide a playground would that
give you?" asked Reed.
"A lot about 150 feet wide and 825 feet
Jong," responded Mr. Symmes.
"You cannot play baseball in a lot that
size," said Reed, and after considerable
discussion as to rights of children, "one
old cat, 'rounders" and other games,' the
subject was dropped, Supervisor Braun
hart objecting to the proposed, elimina
tion of families from the part of the city
in which he resides.

Improvement Club asked that a park be

about fifty acres which it is anxious to
dispose of to the city for $40,000. As this
rite is adjacent to that which the same
company is offering as a suitable location
for a pesthouse, the Board of Works was
directed to make a comparative estimate
of the value of the two pieces of property.
According to George H. Roundey, who
spoke for the club, it is one of the great
est pieces of property ever offered.
The committee also" recommended .the
drafting of an ordinance to call for a
bond issue of $500,000 instead of $1,000,000
for the improvement of accepted streets,
with a view of improving the San Bruno
road. Roundey also made a plea for this.
George D. Center spoke in opposition to
the proposed Issue for sewer bonds, say
ing the people, of the Mission district
were opposed to the plan as outlined by
the Board of Public Works, as it was
"costly, useless and impracticable, and
the worst that had ever been submitted."
Other propositions that have been sug
gested will come up for consideration at
the final meeting of the committee for
revision.

Denied. . â¢
Margaret H. Ryan was declared com

the ground that the $6000 offered her for

sufficient. She claimed that she should
receive a larger, share of the estate. Her
opposition was so strong that her chil

AGAIN CONFINED
IN SANITARIUM
Lady Yarde-Buller in
Custody at Livermore
Asylum.
Christmas Escapade Ending
at Hay wards Cause of
Her Trouble.
Lady Leilah Klrkham Blair Yarde-
Buller, the brilliant but unfortunate
woman whose sanity, conduct and prop
erty ha.ve been the cause of so much liti
gation in this country and in Europe, is
again confined la Dr. Kobertson's Sani
tarium at LiverMore. This time her in
carceration is the Tesult of an escapade
which began in San Francisco Christmas
and which ended in Haywards, where,
according to the story told to her former
landlady by her guardian, Lady Yarde-
Buller was taken in custody by officers
and detained until the guardian, George
T. Wright, caused -her removal to tne
Livermore sanitarium.
Since Lady Yarde-Buller's appearance
in Judge Ellsworth's court in Oakland
some -weeks ago,/ during" the hearing of
"Baron" Baroteau's suit for $30$0 for ser
vices as . her bodyguard, at which, ap
pearance Â£he created a scene in court by
her hysterical conduct, she has been liv-*
ing quietly at the lodging-house at 712
Van Ness avenue, where she has been
sheltered for the past fifteen months.
She has had her liberty, but has not
had money enough in her possession to
permit of the indulgences that have
wrecked her fortunes and health.
Just prior to Christmas Lady Yarde-
Buller was given a small amount â¢ of
money by her guardian, in order that she
might gratify her desire to send gifts to
a few old friends and former servants.
As a result she spent Christmas eve down
town and when Christmas night came she
wag again anxious to get beyond theÂ«four
walls of her narrow existence in the Van
Ness-avenue lodging-house. She left
about 8 o'clock, saying she was going to
Oakland to visit her old servant, Mrs.
Annie Mulhearn, who lives in a â¢ little
home given her by Lady Yarde-Buller's
father. She wore her famous sealskin
coat, against the protest of her landlady,
who feared it might be the means of her
identification and cause a scandal during
her absence. She carried a small parcel,
a gift for Mrs. Mulhearn.
Thursday passed without Lady Yarde-
Buller's having returned. Meanwhile ru
mor reached San Francisco that she was
again confined in the Livermore Sani
tarium. Inquiry at the Van Ness-avenue
lodging-house last night confirmed 'the
rumor. The landlady admitted that Lady
Yarde-Buller had not returned from her
Christmas night trip, and further that her
trunk was packed in her room upstairs
waiting to be shipped to-day to the Liv
ermore Sanitarium.
The landlady said that George T.
Wright, the guardian of Mrs. Blair, aa
Lady Yarde-Buller was always known at
her house, and "Baron" Baroteau called
yesterday and told her that Lady Yarde-
Buller had been taken into custody at
Haywards: Wright said that under the
circumstances it was better, for the pro
tection of his ward and the good name
of the family, that she be confined again
for a short time at Livermore.
"Baron" Baroteau said, according to the
landlady, that he saw Lady Yarde-Buller
go on the Oakland boat Christmas night
and that he crossed the bay on the same
boat, but was in the company of another
we man and did not speak to her. Baro
teau also said that he helped persuade
her to go along quietly when she was
taken in custody at Haywards, inducing
her to believe that the officers were sim
ply friends of his. When they reached
the sanitarium and Lady Yarde-Buller di
vined their purpose she attempted to es
cape and had to be taken in by force.
IS NOT FEDERAL CRIME TO,
STEAL UNMAILED MATTER
Packages Left on Top of Letter-Boxes
Are There at Owners'
Risk.
. J. T. Schmidts was held yesterday by
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock for trial on the charge of having
broken open a street mail box. His bonds
were fixed at $500.
There are two other prisoners in tho
hands of the United States Marshal
awaiting examination on charges of steal
ing packages of mail matter that had
been carelessly left on top of street letter
boxes.
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning- will . move to dismiss the charges
against these two, as they have not vlo-'
lated any Federal statute or postal regu
lation, the packages not having been
mailed, although properly stamped and
addressed. The postal laws apply to mail
matter that has been placed in the proper
receptacle. Packages too large to be de
ppsited in the street letter and newspaper
boxes cannot be mailed until they are de
livered to an employe of the Postofnce
and they are no safer from theft when
they' are on top of the box than they
would be if thrown upon the sidewalk.
DANGEROUS PRACTICE
ON VAN NESS AVENUE
Coasting Is a Growing and Seriou3
Menace to Drivers and
Equestrians.
Coasting is becoming an alarming recre
ation on Van Ness avenue, and if not
stopped the services of the Coroner will
surely be brought into prominence, spirit
ed horses will one day be flying affrighted
and the neighborhood will be mourning
the loss of some of those sturdy young
sters who now brave the danger. From
Pacific avenue to Union street the menace
to life and limb is daily increasing, as
was demonstrated yesterday afternoon
when half a.dozen of the precocious coast
ers slid down hill in rapid succession,
frightening a spirited and valuable team,
besides placing the occupants of the car
riage in peril. Some other youngsters
hitched to the back of the vehicle and on
becoming-, suddenly detached fell head
over heels with terrific force. It is the
generally expressed opinion on the avenue
that before serious injury occurs this
practice should be stopped.

Removes Tip of Gas-Burner While
Intoxicated and Lays Down
to Die.
Harry Robertson, a barber, rooming at
2756 Bush street, committed suicide last
Thursday evening by asphyxiating him
self in the bathroom. He had been cele
brating Christmas in the pleasant alco
holic way and was put to bed at half-past

RABBIS PREACH
ON LIVE TOPICS
Dr. Nieto Declares That
Judaism May Be
' Universal.
Dr. Nieto of the Congregation Sherlth
Israel spoke last evening on the passing
of religious systems. The lecturer Said
that they, like all other creations of the
human intellect, were subject to the laws
governing production, growth and decay.
It was only "when they had been conceived
to reach perfection and had been com
mitted to a definite written form, for
which its followers and promoters
claimed immutability and stability, that
its period of decay was really heralded.
Judaism, he declared, had in it the ele
ments which would go to form what the
prophets foreshadowed as the outcome of
all religious activity, namely, a univer
sal religion founded upon a strict moral
ity. Judaism in its present form, how
ever, could not become a universal reli
gion because of its national character,
but if human experience and what it im
parts, meant anything to them, then,
whether they would or no, that which
was tribal or national being carried forth
into the world and presented to all men
alike, must expand into the universal,
providing that national traits be obliter
ated.
The prophets foreshadowed a universal
church, Jesus had made the same pro
phecy. All men felt impressed with that
idea and were impelled continuously to
remove obstacles to its realization.
The Rev. J. Voorsanger in his sermon,
"A New Year's Suggestion," at Temple
Emanu-El, said that all nations had, one
time or another, celebrated what were
known as the threshold feasts, either In
early or late winter, whether Easter, New-
Year or Passover. He reminded hla
hearers that history was largely made up
of the results of people's deeds. They did
not know the motives of the past, but its
history they did know. They knew the
history of moral struggles, of the educa
tion of the mind and the vindication of
the spirit. Intellectual truth was shifting
all the time, since what was true to-day
was not true to-morrow, but moral
truth was unchanging because it applied
to conduct, discipline and character.
Theology was not to-day what it was
years ago. There was nothing concrete
about theology now. The Bible was even
changed. The lecturer further said that
they should persuade themselves that civ
ilized humanity was going in the right di
rection and that in divine truth rested
man's happiness.

Christmas Tree Delights
a Large Number of
"Bucks."
San Francisco Lodge* No. 3. B. P. O.
Elks, held a Christmas tree festival at
Its clubrooms on Sutter street and Grant
avenue last night, which was pronounced
by the 300 or more Elks who were present
as one of the pleasantest affairs of ita
kind ever held in the, city.
In one corner of the big hall a large
Christmas tree, prettily decorated, was
placed. It was loaded with presents, some
of them so big 1 and weighty that a num
ber of muscular members of the order
were appointed a committee to keep the
branches off the floor.
Mayor Schmitz, who is a member of the
lodge, was present and entered into the
spirit of the affair. He received numerous
presents, every one of which was appro
priate.
â¢'Wilhelmina" Harris was the distribut
ing agent and he kept the large crowd
laughing heartily with hla funny remarks.
In the hands of Judge J. C. B. Hebbard
the celebration was not allowed to draff.
The Judge can "sire" a jinks and he can
also play at Santa Claus with the best
of them.
While none of the presents cost more
than 10 cents every one of them contained
some sort of a josh on the foibles and
idiosyncrasies of the receiver.
During the distribution of the hundreds
of gifts refreshments were served, and
-when at a. late hour the tables -were strip
ped and the tree bare a jolly, lively crowd
poured from the hall, all bemoaning that
Christmas came but once a year.
The "Weighs and Meals" committee
which arranged the affair is composed of
the following: J. N. Odell, D. S. Jacobs,
R. P. Churchill, F. E. Beck, J. K. Polk,

French Bark Henriette
Suddenly Passes Out

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or.. Dec. 27.â The little
| French bark Henriette, ESS tons, met with
a peculiar accident at an early hour this
morning and now lies submerged in the
upper harbor with a bole in her bottom.
She sank before daylight, but all the men
reacbei shore in safety as they had am
;-ue warning of the bark's condition.
For some time past the Henriette had
been lying at safe anchorage, but the
plow that carr.e up Christmas eve drove
her out of the channel. Owing to her
Enaaa draft, however, she was not con
sicerec to be in danger and no effort was
rrsaae to tew her haclc into deep water un
-..1 yeserday afternoon. At that time the
rug walÂ»l& went to the bark, but the
pilot advised that e\,t> be permitted to re
mam v.here ehe was as the weather was
so severe that it wculd have been difficult
and dangerous to take her in tow.
Ihe night tide fell very low and about
xO o clock it was noticed that the vessel
-iad grounded. Soon after she began
leaking -and soon there was three feet of
water in the hold. Notwithstanding that
the pumps had bocn manned the water
gained steadily and ci launch was sent
ior. The men were taken ashore.
Before dnwn the vergel had eunk to the
'hotlcrr, whtn? she now iies. At half tide
her de^k is even with tho water, while at
righ water, it is entirely submerged.
"Whether the vc-sec-I struck" a rock or set
tled or. her own anchor is a question that
has not yet been answered, as no exami
nation has been made. It is thought,
however, "that the anchrr forced the hole
:n the bottom. , That she 5s badly dam

i:ntii tbe owners have been heard from.

fcition. Before the. vessel's predicament
wks realized ehe had touched bottom on

a short time later without damage.

the storm without much difficulty, how

Commands a Wind-jammer.
Captain J. II. Lane is again in com
mand of a wind-jammer. In the old days
he was master of the Germania, then of
the Gleaner, then of the Harry Morse
and then he moved over to the steamship
Valencia. Now he gives up the latter and
goes back to tail and will take the Ken
nebec from here along the coast and then
to Australia. As a shipmaster Captain
Lan? nas made a record all along the
coast and the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company is more than sorry to lose his
services. As the chances are that the
Valencia will be sold to the highest bidder
In the near future she will probably so
Into some foreign trade. Captain Lane
did not want to take any chances, so he
moved bag and baggage from the Valen
cia to the Kennebec.
Trouble on the Point Arena.
The father of two young men who had
taken passage on the steamship Point
Arena made trouble yesterday. He did
not want the lads to sail and vowed tho
ship was leaking three inches of water an
hour. He caUed up the Inspectors of hulls
and boilers, but those gentlemen insisted
that the vessel had passed inspection and
was free to go and come as she pleased.
In any event the young men sailed on the
vessel and the- father saw them wave him
a joyous *'good-by."
Water Front Notes.
Among the passengers who will sal! on
the Thomas January IS will be Captain
George H. Whitney, Carl F. Lehners and
George D. Clagett. The former is Inspec
tor of hulls, Lehners is inspector of boil
ers and Clagett is the secretary of the
commission. They will go to the Hawaii
an Islands as United States Inspectors of
hulls and boilers and all the vessels now
in the inter-island trade will have to pass
through their hands. If the vessels are
not up to Uncle Sam's requirements they
will have to retire, and in consequence
there is quite a flutter among owners in
the islands at this time. Messrs. Whit
ney and Lehners assert that there will be
no discrimination and every vessel now
plying in Hawaiian waters will have to
come up to the requirements.
B. J. Smith, a x machinist, was seriously
injured at the corner of East and Mission
streets yesterday. He was on his way to
Vallejo when a San Mateo car ran him
down. At the Harbor Hospital it was
found that he had been injured about the
head and some bones in his left hand
were broken.

"a record ,breakeW amprigj^ihe five suc

enjoyed by. the United States. Its pre
eminence, the : Review <>ta tee, 7 was all tho
more notable 'be.cause.:;it'' suffered triftn a
combination of happenings that In a nor

if not disastrous. Enumerated In the lat

assassination qÂ£ â¢'â â  President '- McKlnley.
Summarizing the general situation, the
Review says: . ., .. . ., . -â 
Briefly summarized, '..the, .Jyear has seen
transacted an eggregate of general business as
reflected in bank* clearings,, far- In excess of
any preceding period; . . has witnessed stock
speculation, rampant beyond .iths dreams of
old-time brokers, checked and curtailed by one
of the sharpest stock panics' li* history an-J
yet with a remarkable mlnlmnm~of disturbance
of general financial operations; has watched
general Industry and production grow stead
ily until new and larger figures - were needed
to express the outputs of coal/ ore. Iron, steel,
leather, lumber and a multitude ot other
branches; has seen the freight transportation
facilities of the country, strained to the break
ing point, prove Insufficient to handle the vol
ume of business offered, and' finally has wit
nessed a volume of holiday' business passing
all previous bounds both in quantity and qual
ity and the vastly increased, purchasing power
of the public in late years. From the stand
point of the present estimates the clearings this
year will exceed the highest records of preced
ing years by one-fourth. Gross railway earn
ings have increased 12 per cent and net re
turns have gained 16 per cent over the beat
preceding year.,. . â¢ â¢-.- --:-..';â¢
Big Gain in Bank Clearings.
Piglron production will be not far from one
seventh larger than" the heaviest ever before
recorded. Shoe and shipments and
larger leather production have been apparent.
Iron production and shipments were never be
fore equaled. Anthracite coal production will
be fully 10 per cent larger than last year and
5 per cent heavier than the record. Woolen
manufacturing ha3 been helped by low cost of
material and good demand for clothing. AH
been legs money in cotton for the South this
year. The agricultural interest has been fa
vored by heavy, advances in farm products
which have done much to counterbalance re
ductions â  in yield. Export trade has shown
signs of hesitation after years of steady ad
vance and imports have increased, but mainly
in materials intended for domestic manufac
ture, and the margin -in favor of exports is
still enormously heavy. : â¢ â 
The bank clearings are estimated at
$118,000,000,000, a gain of 38 per cent over
last year and 26 per cent over 1*9!). i The
Middle States show the greatest increases
In clearings.
The failures for the year are placed at
10.SS5, with aggregate liabilities of $130,
000,000 and assets of $60,300,000. As to this
showing the Review says: ;
This is a gain of 8.C per cent in number
over 1900, and of nearly 12 percent over 1830,
but back of, that year comparisons favor the
current one. Liabilities have not sained rela
tively so heavily, as shown by the fact that
they are only 2.4 per cent larger this year than
last and 6.8 larger than in 1890. in only three
of the past thirteen years, in fact, were liabili
ties smaller* than they were this year. A
point often lost sight of Is that there is a
constant accession of new Individuals, firms
and corporations in business each year, and this
alone furnishes a basis for the recording of
numerous unsuccessful ventures. There are
now 172,000 more people in business than there
were a decade ago, an increase of 10 per cent
but failures have oilly increased 5 per cent in
number during that period and liabilities are
only 20 per effnt larger. A continuing un
favorable feature is the small percentage of
assets to liabilities. It la only 4Q.1 per cent
this year as against 47.2 per cent a year ago
and 52 per cent in 1S90 and 189S.
As to prices the Review says:
Wheat has reached the highest point since
1S9S; corn and oats are higher than fcr almost
a decade and other produce has sympathized.
Food products, as a whole; are- higher than
In the general price boom of 1000,- while manu
factures are lower, notable in this respect be
ingr leather, textiles, coal and coke, naval
stores, building materials, .chemicals . a: - j
drugs and miscellaneous products.
Imports Gain Slightly.
Prices as a whole are S, per. cent lower than
February. 1000, and . December, 1800, but are
hlarher.' than in any year- from 1803 until the
third quarter of 189!). . If othar products fol

NORTHERN PACIFIC ROAD
TO LOWER FREIGHT RATE3
New Schedule Will Cover Territory
Between St. Paul and the Pa
cific Coast.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 27.â The Northern-Pa
cific will soon announce a revision of its
principal freight tariffs, covering the ter
ritory between St. Paul and the Pacific
Coast and establishing lower through
rates. Similar tariffs will be announced
at the same time by the Great Northern.
Northern Pacific rate clerks have been
at work on the revision for more than
two months. It is stated semi-officiallv
that the important feature of the new
tariffs will be the removal of discrimina
tions that have gradually grown for sev
eral years, and radical changes, especially
in local rates, that will adjust many sub
jects of complaint3 from shippers. .The
new Gr^at Northern tariffs will be'con
structed on smiilar lines. Both roads. It
Is asserted, will make voluntary-reduc
tions in rates, based upon the increased
earning capacity of their lines and the
growth of revenue.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
JCJSw TCRX. Dec. 27.â To-day'e dealings in
â¢tocks were in excess of those of yesterday
and the market had the appearance of strength
and activity throughout. A closer analysis of
results will show, however, that the activity
a.r.:i strength were mainly in a few prominent
etocks. In fact, there was active realizing
going on all day, and when belated borrowers
on call found the money rate rielng sharply
over their demand the movement to realize
became general. The top level of prices was
considerably reduced, and as a consequence the
market chov.ed no disposition to rally, clos
ing dull and steady at the reaction. The high
ly industrials were the conspicuous
features cf the market all day with Sugar etill

It was lifted to 117% and closed at 115%, a

paign in the stock by the bears was thus pretty
conclusively demonstrated to be a failure. The
price of refined sugar was advanced by all of
the companies to-day and there were confi
dent predictions that the duties on crude sugar
â w.^uld be reduced. Similarly hopeful views
-wore expressed regarding the copper Industry,

London Market.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The settlement occupied attention on the Stock
Exchange to-day and business was meager
after the holidays. *The tone was cheerful,
however; the Argentine settlement counteract
ing the bad effects resulting from the Boer
success.â The American department was good
throughout, finishing strong on New York sup
port, particularly of Atchison and Union Pa
cific There is some talk over here of a New
Year's boom in the market, but London dis
likes this week's traffic returns of some of
the big railroads and is inclined to ask whether
the poor showing | 8 due to the storms or
trade conditions. Then, too, we want to see

NEW YORK. Dec-27^-Bradstreefa.to-mor
row will say; Â» ~i ' i f â  * : '
Reports of a record-ijreaklng holiday trade,
of seasonable quiet "In leading wholesale lines,
of exceptional. activity^ at .top prices In iron
and steel, of sustained activity ,'lR; ; other indus
tries, continued j complaint of car" and motive
power shortages; p.nd a -hardening of
speculative markets for food products are the
features of trade advices to. Bradstreefs this
week.
The year ploses/with a burst of activity in
Iron and steel: Pig Iron' sales for the week have
never been equaled at this season and lack of
adequate transport fa'cllitles alono is;a bar
to a still greater volume of distribution. The
outlook is for a production of 16,000,000 tons
of pigiron of 30,000,000 tons of ore and of 12.
000 000 tons of steel in 1901. Prices have ad
vanced of late and $15 75@16 is freely paid at
valley furnaces for Bessemer deliveries In the
first quarter or next year. In finished products
the mills are crowded- with business. â  Wire
rods have advanced SI per ton. In the coke
trade supplies are piling up near the ovens,
but furnaces are shutting down owing to the
lack of cars to move one to tha other.
Wheat apparently cut- loose, from corn thi3
week and displayed exceptional activity and
strength for a holiday week. The winter wheat
markets took the lead In this respect, buying
being especially good at St. Louis. Reports
of lack of snow over the winter crop have been
received, but reports of a smaller surplus in
Argentina, better cables, light receipts West
and Northwest and smaller gains in the vis
ible supply have all been features. Export
business has rather been checked by the rise.
Corn has been dull, though steadied by wheat,
while oats have firmed up a little. Provisions
have shown more strength and cheese has been
helped also. â¢-
The cut in refined sugar of 10 to 25 points
Is really a reflection of the reduction i In raw
quotations, though talk of the "war" con
tinues. .
Coffee is stronger and in better demand.
Business failures for the week number 219,
as against 262 last week, 213 in this week last
year. 220 in 1890, 218 in 1898 and 297 in 1897.
Canadian' failures number 16, as against 24
last week, 15 in this week a year ago and 22
In 1S99. â  '
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
If any evidence Was needed of the unparalleled
prosperity with which this nation has been
blessed during the paEt year the expenditure
for Christmas Blfts- and decorations should be
ample. Distribution of Christmas goods among
the employes of large firms and corporations
was online same scale, often the Increase over
last year amounting to 100 per cent, while the
profit-sharing at the end of the year will
reach an unprecedented figure. It is noticed
that Southern trade shows less i satisfactory
gains 'over last year than at other sections,
which is not surprising, as the principal ! pro
duct of the South has averaged from $8 to $10
a bale less than a year, ago. while the quantity
thus far marketed shows no commensurate In
crease. ' . â¢ .
Following closely upon the interruption by
floods and storms last week tranÂ«norting and
manufacturing facilities were fu ""'â¢ handi
capped by numerous accidents. Ii. furnaces
and steel mills were tied up and â Â»â  move
ment of coke was hampered. This'.cculted In"
such insufficient supplies of fuel that many
stacks were banked at a time when full ac
tivity was especially desired. , The situation
as' to coke is more critical than at any* pre
." â  â â â¢.'â  ' .. ' ; '., v ' : â  â -â : . : â '.'â¢>â ' ''â 'â ' 'â â '.â  : â  â 
vious time this season. * The output In the
Connellsvllle region has been at a record
breaking pace for a month or more, . but stocks
accumulated at the ovens because motive power
and cars cannot be secured. Pig iron produc
tion is no longer at the high mark recorded
when December opened and with fancy prices
for fuel it is natural that Bessemer sheets
advance.
â¢Business in wholesale dry goods ' has been
Interrupted by hqllday influences and stock
taking â  among jobbers. Cotton goods ruled
quiet, apart from ( the demand for converters,
which was on a liberal scale.- Cotton mills
are sold ahead for several months as a rule
and there is no urgency to make new contracts,
especially in view -of the uncertain raw ma
terial.
â  In the woolen goods division overcoatings
find ready purchasers. ; while prices on some
lines just opened are about 5 per cent higher
than Jaet season. : .
Wool Is strong and turning upward, with a
good demand not only from mills and dealers
but on speculative account. Stocks are closing
the year In much better/condition than at the
start, exceptional consumption having made
large Inroads. Footwear shops are actively
engaged and are shipping much more heavily
than a year agro. Leather and hides are strong,
but comparatively Quiet.
A decidedly high price level has been main
tained in the leading staples, with, options
trading pf good dimensions despite the double
holiday at the Produce Exchange. Wheat re
covered most of the recent moderate decline,
supported by a fairly steady decline. Not
withstanding the high level of quotations rs
compared with earlier years exports for. tha
week from all ports of the United States, in
cluding flour, amounted to 3.!>40.972 bushels.
compared with 2.765,014 bushels a year ago
and 2.417.01S bushels two years ago.
- Interior receipts were light and flour mills
have been handicapped by the car shortage,
which made it difficult to bring in raw ma
terial or take out the finished product.
Corn continues about CO per cent over the
price a year ago. which readily explain? At
lantlc exports of only 313.25S bushels, against
8,319,258 bushels last year. . â¢
Sugar became conspicuous through the ng
frressive cutting of quotations by competing
refiners. Raw gradep declined slightly on ac
count of bl? crop estimates and other outside
influences, but the fall in standard and granu
lated was disproportionately heavy and at the
bottom point, after deducting all rebates, no
profit could .be figured. Even at the lowest
price buyers were slow to take advantage, evi
dently anticipating more favorable terms.
Failures for the week number 250 In the
United States, against 237 last year, and 23
in Canada, against 18 last year.

telligence- May opened hi.<S>\ac lower at 82 %@
S2%c. Buying for the country account caused
an advance early to 82%c. this being tha
highest point of the day. The market had
poor support, save when close to 82c, or at
that figure. It was" owing to buying at this
price that apparently saved' the market from
further decline. The purchasing operations
were credited to manipulators. The selling was
largely in the way of profit-taking. The close
was steady, May %c down, at 82c.
The corn market was again dull and feature
less. May closed easier, %Â®%c under Mon
day, at CO%@UGJ/.c.
Oats were exceptionally dull. Hay closed

Provisions were strong on a light run of

Poultry and Game are selllr.)? at last â¢week's
prices, but are not as plentiful aa they havÂ»
been. Meats are very firm at the higher prices,
and there are no signs of their being any
cheaper at the moment, as the supply Is more
i or less light all over the United States.
Fruits are now pretty well whittled down to
Oranges, Apples and Pears. Summer Vegeta
bles now come chiefly from the southern part of
the State-, and are high.
Some kinds of Fish are dearer.

RENEWS A FIGHT
Agitates Action for Ben
efit of Harbor Im

Calls for Data to Be Sent
<5| to tho Congressional
Committee.
Oakland omcc San Francisco Call,
HIS Iiroadway, Dec. 27.
The Oakland Heard of Trade has taken
â  fre^h hold upon the Oakland harbor Im
provement agitation in the hope that re
newed effort may be of benefit during the
present session of Congress.
To that end the directs* to-day adopted
resolutions which indorse tin- memorial
recently r.dopted by the Rivera and Har
bors Conrreps held at Baltimore, wherein
ihe National Congress was urged to make;
sufficient appropriation for improvement
of waterways.
The board of directors also recommend
ed that Colonel Ileuer of the United
fciates engineer corps be requested to mip
Â» Jhe board with a cross-section map
of the harbor, showing work already dor.<Â»
t>y the Government. The object ' is to
point out rhat. although thÂ«* average width
â¢>Â£ the Government channel is S00 feet.
only boo fen has been dredged by the Gov
ernment, the remainder of the work being
left to the city or to private owners.
It is deelred by the Board of Trade that
this map snail be used as an exhibit bo
fore the Kiverr and Harbor? Committee
in Congress when the matter of further
appropriation for improvement shall be
brought bufort* that body.
Whether Oakland will receive favorable
consideration at Lhe hands of the House
is a question that is greailv
the men who have been fort>
â .iost in the tight for a wider and a deeper
'vnannel. From private sources have come
advices that "Oitkland may perhav-c
!>e crowdea out." referring to the com
position of the liver? and harbors bill.
It is also doubtful whether another
hearing will be given by the eomraitte*;
~r* Oakland's claims, as the leaders on
that committee appear to have all of ii:e
evidence tney desire on the subject. This
stand is in a !arge measure due to the
inspection last summer by the committee.
At all events, the Board of Trade has
Kept alive its fight, and is sending almost
Â£aily to the Representatives in Congress
from this district documentary evidence

HOUNDS UP CHINAMEN
WITH A SIX-SHOOTElt
Uaval Officer Makes Laundry "Boss"
Disgorge Money Taken From
Elis Chinese Servant.
BERKELEY, Dec. 27.â The Chinamen in
a local wa^hhouse had an exciting expe
rience wiri an infuriated mariner and a
large Fix-r.hooter Christmas night which
they will not soon forget. The mariner
x.-u-n Cajptiiin A. X. Wood, an officer in
the United States navy, who resides at
2S27 Bancroft way. thi6 city. Captain
Wood arrived from San Francisco, bring
ing with him a Chinese boy servant to
assist in currying numerous gifts the cap
tain had purchased the day previous. On
arriving at Berkeley the service of an ex
prtssman was secured and the Chinese
boy left at the station with a return tick
et. The boy got confused after Captain
Wood left him and refused to take thÂ«5
return train, evidently in fear that it
T.ould carry him to unknown lands.
J. E. Boyd. an old resident of this city,
went to the lad's rescue, but as the boy
coold spea'.t no English Boyd took him to
a nearby Chinese laundry to have hiÂ»
countrymen set him aright. The Celes
tials assursd Boyd that they would put
the boy on the next train.
An hour later Boyd discovered the lad
at the station crying and as he knew
whose Chinaman he was he took him to
Wood's. A Chinese cook from a neighbor
ing house was secured as interpreter and
the boy told that his countrymen had in
vited him to "hit the pipe" and had in
troduced h.m to a fantan game, whereby
he lost hit) money, 517, and the return
ticket. Captain Wood took a six-shooter
Â£nd went to the washhouse. At first the
boss said "no eabee," but the persuasive
six-ehooter soon brought out the $17 and
the ticket, and the boy was sent on his
tvuy rejoicins:.

ajrer of the Oakland Transit Company,
have accepted tho gago of battle thrown
down by Egbert B. Btone. tho prominent
contractor, concerning tho new Fchedule
of fares over the Ouklaml. San I-eandro
and Hay wards division of the Transit
Company's system. Both of tho railroad
men declare that the abolition of com
mutation and other special rates will not
inflict a hardship upon many of their
patrons.
Mr. Havens said:
"The idea in the change of fares was
to cut the cash fares. It is a mere hand
ful of people who travel on Â«:ummutation
tickets between Ilavvrards, or San Leati
dro and Oakland.""
But Mr. Stone's chief cause for com
plaint lies in the fact that the residents
in that large territory about Elmhurst
are now without the commutation privi
lege. In his reply to Mr. Stone, who was
one of the road's bi& stockholders before
it was sold, Manager Kelly has this to
say:
Taking: October as a typical month, when
service was not interrupted and travel was at
the maximum, our records show that the in
come from commutation tickets of all kinds
was less than S per cent of the total income;
that the total number of commuters from Oak
land to Haywards was 17: from Oakland to San
Ltandro, 190; free passengers exclusive of era
ploye*. 1415; that the total number of paying
passengers exclusive of commuters was in
round numbers 63.000. We believe, therefore,
that our patrons who ray us SÂ«2 per cent of our
revenue will appreciate a reduction of 20 per
cent in the round trip rate and 33 1-3 per cent
in the single fare rate to San I-eandro and
Haywards and "50 per tent reduction in rate
from San Leandro to San Lorenzo. The reduced
rates will undoubtedly result in reduced reve
nue at first, but we believe that a sacrifice of
immediate revenue is warranted by the ulti
mate benefit that will result to all the citi
zens of Alameda County who are interested In
cheap transportation. A cash fare as low as
the business conditions will permit, with trans
fers to connecting lines in Alameda, Oakland
and Berkeley, with special privileges and free
paepps to nonÂ», is a sound business proposition
which we think will meet with the approval
of the large majority.
The residents of Elmhurst who desire
a modification of the new schedule as af
fecting their section have called a mass
meeting for to-morrow night for consid
eration of the proposition. The new rates
go Into effect January L

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1901.
COVERED BY DARKNESS OF CHRISTMAS
NIGHT ALAMEDA PRISONERS ESCAPE
Conductor William Davis Sees Fleeing Criminals on Train
and Dissipates Theory That They Gained Freedom in
Light of Day, as Was First Believed by the Sherilf
OAKLAND. Dec. 27.â The first trace
of the whereabouts of W. Frank
Case and AVilliam Kelley, who
escaped from the County Jail, has
been uncovered by William Davis,
a conductor on the Webster street broad
gauge train, whose story definitely settles
the fact that the daring prisoners guined
freedom hours before yesterday's dawn,
at which time the Sheriff originally be
lieved they broke jail.
Davis, who knows Case well., saw the
fugitive and his companion on the train
that left Franklin and Fourteenth streets
depot at 11:45 o'clock Christmas night.
The conductor talked with the escaped
prisoners, not realizing that his passen
gers had gained their liberty by breaking
jail. Although Davis was a bit surprised
to see Case, for the railroad man knew
the fugitive had been in trouble with the
police, he gave the presence of the run
away no special thought. Case and Kel
ley rode in tho smoking car to the Ala
meda mole sand went across the bay on
the ferry-boat Bay City.
"You see," said Conductor Davis to
night, "I had an idea that Case had got
out of his scrape, so I paid no further
attention to him. I observed that both
Case and Kelley, whom I also knew by
Blght, were very dirty. Their clothing
was covered with dust.
"Xeither man was at all nervous and
there was nothing in their demeanor to
indicate that they feared pursuit. They
were making no attempt to conceal them
selves from public view."
During a short conversation with Case,
Davis said his* passenger made an off
hand remark that he was going to ship
aboard a vessel in San Francisco and
get out of the country.
Even that remark did not arouse Davis'
suspicions that anything was wrong.
Escapes Head for San Francisco.
The pair of runaways went to the Ala
meda pier and Conductor Davis says he
believes they* boarded the last boat for
San Francisco. He saw nothing more of
them after he went through the train
selling tickets.
Such is the evidence that effectually
disposes of Sheriff Rogers' theory that
the men broke jail yesterday morning.
They were out of prison before the last
hour of Christmas day. had gone. Hav
ing escaped in time to catch the 11:45
train to San Francisco, the men could
not have been in their cells at the regu
lar hourâ 9 p. m.â for locking up. It is
now supposed that they were hidden
PROFESSORS MEET
FOR DISCUSSION
Two Sessions of Pacific
Coast Philological
Society.
The Philological Association of the
Pacific Coast held yesterday the third
and fourth sessions of the third annual
meeting at the Mark Hopkins Institute.
Learned professors of the Universities of
California, Oregon and Stanford presented
papers criticizing, elucidating and analyz
ing the classical masterpieces of the
authors of antiquity. The characteristic
beauties in the productions of each writer
and his individual mode of expression
were designated and explained.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California read a paper on
"The Position of the Persian Fleet at
Salamis." following the account given by
Aeschylus and Herodotus. In presenting
his subject President Wheeler used a map
to Illustrate the positions of the two con
tending forces. He quoted from both
authors to prove that Herodotus' account
of the battle is entirely self consistent and
not inconsistent with the description given
by Aeschylus. Much Interest was mani
fested in President Wheeler's disserta
tion and at the conclusion of his paper
many of the professors joined in a discus
sion of the points advanced.
At the morning session papers were read
by Dr. H. XV. Prescott of the University
of California. Professor H. R. Fairclough
of Standford University. Professor H. K.
Shilling of University of California, Presi
dent II. T. Archibald of Occidental Col
lege and Professor J. B. Matzke of Stan
ford University. After Benjamin Ido
Wheeler's paper was read papers were
presented by Professor C. Searles of
the Stanford University, Professor L. J.
Richard.Â«on of the University of Califor
nia. E. IT. Putnam of the Stanford Uni
versity arid Professor John Fryer of the
University of California.
Maccabees' Christmas Festival.
San Francisco Tent or the Maccabees
had a Christmas time festival for old and
young In Its hall in the Pioneer building
last night. There were several hundred
persons present, including the members
of San Francisco and Fraternal hives, the
ladies' branch of the order. Tho feature
of the evening was a large Christmas
tree made bright with tinsel and- fancy
ornaments and loaded with packages that
were addressed to members of the tent
and the hives and their children. These
were distributed by James W. Disbrow,
who was assisted by the committee of ar

away in a bathroom adjoining the cell
corridor and under cover of night made
good â  their escape.
Case is particularly well known among
the railroad men because he has a broth
er and a father in the Southern Pacific
employ, both of whom are trustworthy
men. After the fugitive's release from
the State penitentiary a year ago he
spent most of his time in Oakland, and
was much in evidence traveling on the
local trains. That he was a former jail
bird was known to only a few people
outside of the police. They had been
keeping close watch upon his movements.
It was this careful espionage which led
to his arrest with Charles Merrill for the
tobbery of a Chinese on the Eighth-street
bridge. This was the charge upon which
Case wag awaiting trial.
Saws Used Found by Sheriff.
The saws used in cutting through the
bars at the jail were found to-day in one
of the cells, 'j., Â» jailbreakers had left
them within convenient reach of any
other lelon that became wearied of con
finement, but the Sheriff found them first.
The Sheriff is too greatly concerned over
the loss of his prisoners to take other
than a serious view of the situation. His
remaining prisoners, however, unharn-

and Messrs. Moran, Cohn. Nowlan and

"Carmen" and Looking at Hum
orous Stereopticon Views.
The members of the Pacific Coast Com
mercial Travelers' Association and the
United Commercial Travelers' Associa
tion and their friends packed the Grand
Opera-house last night to hear Minnie
Seligman as Carmen. The evening was
set aside for the commercial travelers and
several special features were introduced
for their edification. At the end of the
second act Robert H. Davis, president of
the ass&ciatlon, came before the curtain
and made a few remarks. He paid a hiph
tribute to the work which is being accom
plished by the travelers. President Davis
was introduced by William J. Barrett.
At the close of Davis' speech atereoptl
con views were displayed representing the
humorous side of a commercial traveler's
life. Pictures of a number of the well
known members of the association en
countering the trials of the road were
shown and caused great merriment. Min
nie Seligman and the other members ot
the company were at their best and the
travelers and their friends enjoyed a most
delightful evening.

Harvey Dickinson, .a retired capitalist,
80 years of age, who resides at 424 Vallejo

Kearny .street, near Clay about 6:30
o'clock last night, and fell on the pave

Hospital. The Injuries which Mr. Dickin
son received may prove serious on ac
count of his age.
Children Produce Cantata.
A cantata entitled "Christmas Snow"
was produced by the Sunday school chil
dren of the Howard-street M. E. Church
last evening. Parents and friends filled
the church and greatly enjoyed the per
formance. Songs and 'recitations by
Gladys Day. Margaret Olson and Gladys

resident of a literary turn of mind has

poem which will bear the title "Freed

Kelley and Case also contributed their
share to the comedy aspect of the deliv

foot long pole of spliced mop handles
which enabled them to reach the roof are
all carved with fantastic designs. The
rope work ia carefully braided, the loose

WASHINGTON, . Dec. : 27.~The - seven
teenth annual, meeting of the American
Historical Association and . tli<i . annual
meeting of the American Economic As-
Bociation began here to-night and will
continue for several days. For ? their ini
tial gathering the two 'organizations held
a Joint session at the Columbia. Univer
sity, at which General Adolphus W. Gree
ly, chairman of the local reception com
mittee, presided. The features of thl3
session were the addresses of the presi
dents of the respective associations,
Charles Francis Adams of the His
torical Association speaking to the topic
"An Undeveloped- Function," and Profes
sor Richard T. Ely, of the Economic As
sociation having for his subject "Indus
trial Liberty."
Mr. Adams advocated a freer discussion
of political questions by scholars, citing
in this connection his own interest In the
past twelve Presidential campaigns. In
all these, he said, there had been only six
great questions suggested., viz., slavery
reconstruction, currency, the tariff, the
trusts and imperialism. But three of these
had been definitely decided. He believed
that those of slavery, reconstruction and
the currency were definitely disposed of.
but the tariff always would be a great
question and the trusts and imperialism
were issues of to-day. As to trusts, he
said that the study of history throughout
would show the tariff was the bastile of
the trusts.
In an academic discussion of the ques
tion of industrial liberty Professor Elv
declared that liberty cannot be an abso"
lute ideal because authority is needed in
society. On the other hand- socialism fur
nished us with no sufficient ideal of in
dustrial liberty. The. true ideal, he said,
lies midway between anarchism and so
cialism. ,

SPENDS FORTUNE
ON PROSECUTION
R. E. de Lopez Pails* to
Pay Mortgage on
Merriwa Farm.
Famous Stock-Raising Place
Will Pass to Livermore
Bank.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Dec. 27.
R. K. do Lopez, proprietor of tho fam
ous Merrlwa Stock Farm, near Pleasan
ton, was mado the defendant in a suit
brought to-day by the Bank of Uvermora
for $23,000, which is alleged to bo due upon
a mortgage on the farm. Tho inability of
De Lopez to liquidate the mortgage ia
said to be due to the fact that ho spent
a large part of his fortune In the effort
to send to the penitentiary J. F. O'Brien
Jr., who was accused of an attack upon
his daughter, Nina do Lopez.
De Lopez mortgaged the property la
1S0S, v/hen he was in affluent circum
stances and not worrying about hl3 ca
pacity to pay his debts. He made the
farm celebrated for the fast horses that
he raised there, and his dog kennels werÂ»
rated among the best in the world.
But in the midst of De Lopez's pros
perity came sudden calamity. He was in
formed of O'Brien's attack on hi* daugh
ter and he resolved that he would convict
him. He hired attorneys to assist theÂ»
prosecution and spent his money without
counting the cost. The trials of younjr
O'Brien, of which there were two, cost
him thousands of dollars. Opposed to him
was the wealth of the O'Brien family,
who also spent a fortune in the defense
of their relative.
De Lopez has never been able to recu
perate his losses. He has made several
attempts to meet the interest demand.-*
of the note to the bank, but all he has*
been able to pay is $5S0O. representing Â».
series of six separate payments.
The De Lopezes recently removed tÂ»
Australia, und since then have not mada
any effort to pay off the debt that has
been hanging over the farm. They lefc
before the third trial of O'Brien, who was
finally Dermitted to go free for lack oÂ£
prosecution.
The MeVriwa Stock Farm ia part of tho
Santa Rita rancho and was formerly the
property of the late Count Valensln, an
Austrian nobleman. He was the owner oC
the stallion Sydney, which was famous in
his day as a breeder.
Upon the detith of Count Valensin Judgo
W. K. Greene and H. H. Pitcher, his per
sonal friend*, were appointed executors o"
his will. They discovered, however that
the estate was practically bankrupt. Tha
executors are made co-defendants with,
the De Lopezes in the suit of the bank.
ItEQTJESTS COMMUNICANTS
TO HUMBLY BEND THE ICNEfc
The Rev. Martin N. Ray Asks for
More Rsverence on Part of
Worshipers.
OAKLAND, Dec. 27.â The Rev. Martin
N. Ray, rector of St. John's Episcopal
Church, through the Parish Beadle, a
monthly leaflet issued by the rector, has
made the following request to his congre
gation:
"It is hoped that all communicants of
the parish will receive the blessed sacra
ment after careful i uaration at one of
the early celebration. ,n Christmas day,
and will not all persons humbly kneel at
the Incarnatus in the creed â when tho
words, 'And was incarnate by the Holy-
Ghost of the Virgin Mary and was made
man,' are said? The people of our parish
should at least conform to this reverent
practice on Christmas day if it is never
observed at any other time."
The innovation was observed by about
one-third of the worshiping congrega
tion.

Colonel Rawles Takes Ex
treme Precautions at
the Presidio.
The military authorities were fully
awake yesterday to the danger of further
rioting and attacks upon some of the sa
loons outside the Presidio gates and pre
cautions wore taken that made hostile
demonstrations practically Impossible, no
matter what the temper of the "casuals"
who have been causing the trouble.
Extra srucrds were thrown around the
three camps in which the 2500 "casuals"
are quartered, and Major Lockwood, the
commanding officer of those detachments,
took every precaution to keep the men
within the lines, both during th,e day and
at night.
Colonel Rawles ordered the patrol dou
bled and the men called in from the out
posts at night and kept in the district
adjacent to the scene of the recent dis
turbances. In consequence twenty-five
mounted men and as many foot soldiers
were under arms and within reach in case
<jf trouble. In addition, Colonel â¢ Rawles
had forty light artillerymen ready to rush
to the front if word should be sent of im
pending trouble.
Lieutenant Edwards, the officer of the
day, stationed two sentinels in front of
Tarpey's saloon as soon as it began to
grow dark ar.d three other guards were
placed to patro! -Greenwich and Baker
sptreets. Lieuttnant Edwards himself
stayed on the ground to take command
if trouble should develop.
Tarpey's saloon remained closed during
the day. Its broken windows and those
of the "Canteen," Raphael's saloon, were
mute witnesses to the rage of the mob
that made the Thursday night attack.
The police r.ow believe that the de
structive work was done mainly by two
men. Sergeant Campbell and an officer
were at the Presidio yesterday afternoon
trying to secure the identification of the
guilty men.
JUDGE WITHHOLDS SENTENCE.
Pesires to Confer With Lieutenant
Before Surrendering Rioters.
The thirteen soldiers who took part in
the riot Wednesday night at Tarpey's sa
loon on Baker street and were convicted
l>y Judge Conlan Thursday on the charge
of disturbing the peace are still In the
Oty Prison awaiting further develop
ments.
Yesterday morcicg a sergeant with a
provost guard called upon Chief Wittman
â¢witii a letter from Lieutenant Charles E.
ivilbourne Jr. of the Fourteenth Infantry,
acting detachment adjutant, .asking him
to hand over the thirteen men to the
ptara and they -would be tried by court
martial. The Chief referred the note to
fht- Judg-e. who later had a consultation
wSiSi the < ':ief. It was decided, in view
of the riot Thursday nlgnt, not to hand
over the men to the military authorities
â¢until some definite understanding could
be arrived at regarding a cessation of the
riot:rg.
When the men were brought into court
lor sentence the Judge said:
- I have concluded that the defendants formed
part of the rioters and feel I did right in con
victing them. A more serious charge should
have been placed asainst them, as I understand
there was a repetition of the rioting last night
and it must be stopped. The punishment of
twenty-four hours in the guardhouse at the
Fresldio is inadequate and it must be more
severe. People in that vicinity, are entitled to
protection of their lives and property and to
live in peace and quiet, and I will lend my
assistance in doing it.
After last night's riot I have consulted with
the Chief of Police and suggested that the
men should be charged with rioting- instead of
disturbing the i>eace. 'which is absurd in the
circumstances. Usually I do not care to in
terfere with the military authorities, but it
would seem that soldiers have no fear of the
punishment inflicted upon them and It does not
act as a deterrent. These men think they can
get filled, up with liquor, commit any depreda
tion they like acd go back to the Presidio and
get off with twenty-four hours in the guard
house. There ought to be a much more severe
sentence, and unless the defendants are going
to the Philippines at once I shall give them
as long a sentence as the law allows. They
must be made to understand that they cannot
Emash up people's property with impunity.
Addressing himself to the sergeant in
charge of the guard, the Judge said: ' .
I will take this matter under consideration
until to-morrow, and I want you to present
my compliments to Lieutenant Kilbourne and
atk h!m to be in this court to-morrow morn
ing, when the Ch!Â»f of Police will be here.
Â»nd *ve can consider what is best to bz done.
The cases will be continued until to-morrow.
Michael McGrath. a soldier, appeared
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday. He was
in front of Tarpey's saloon Thursday aft
ernoon in a half-drunken condition and
boisterous and making threats as to
what he would do to the "cops." Police
man Rooker was notified that McGrath
was using language calculated to incite
a riot and he remonstrated with him and
advised him to go to camp. McGrath
used the foulest language to the officer
and wants I to flgh; him. He was arrest
ed after a struggle for disturbing the
peace. He tcid the Judge yesterday that
he was booked to go to the Philippines in
fifteen days, and the Judge sentenced him

Best Methods for Making Superior Butter Explained by
Experts, Who Urge Dairymen to Cultivate Habits of
Cleanliness and to Pay Strict Attention to Detail
TWO OFFICERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CREAMERY OPERATORS' ASSOCIATION ' AND SCENE DURING THE
CLOSING SESSION OF THE FIRST ANNUAL. CONVENTION OF THAT j BODY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
WHEN SEVERAL INTERESTING ADDRESSES WERE MADE BY EXPERTS. i .'
THE first annual convention of the
California Creamery Operators'
Association came " to a close last
night after a two days' session,
in which many practical ideas of
value v.-ere advanced. The sessions of
yesterday were attended by a number of
representative business men, a.11 of whom
evinced great interest in the proceedings.
Interesting papers on subjects-pertain
ing to the butter-making industry pre
pared by experts were read during the
day. Resolutions were adopted calling
upon the Legislature to make a suitable
appropriation to the State .University to
enable the Regents to erect, equip ami
maintain a dairy school, and to purchase
a farm for the handling and care of farm
animals under competent instructors. The
passage of the Grout bill by Congress
was al^o demanded. â¢ â - -- â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1901.

Howie, Comotonj H? A. Christenson; Hum-,

Saylor. San Francisco; executive committee â
Fred HilmerrLerby Anderson, H.sB. Glazier.
The morning -was' opened with
an addressTonithe subject,*- '.'Care and Re
pair of Separators," by" E.B..Willey of
San Francisco, who- gave some, .valuable
suggestions. -Tlje- great âtrouble .with
creamery operators was that they did not
take proper care of, the separators.- They
failed to keep .the separator on a level
and seemed to^ act on the theory that
separators are able to take care of them
selves. The separator, was. an important
adjunct of the dairyman's art, and its
proper care was an absolute necessity if
successful operations are looked for. ;
The various kinds of separators em
ployed in' California' creameries were then
discussed by the delegates. Some of these
were declared to be faulty in that they
did not skim properly. W. :H. Rdussel
said the item of repairs to separators was
calculated to fill most creamery men with
despair. This .is largely due to the lack
of care invkeeplng-the bearings clear of
gummy substances. The use of better oil
was urged as being an Important consid
eration. .'â'-_:. . :
Cleanliness in th.e Dairy.'
G. W. Kneib ot Portland, Or., discussed
the subject arsiength. He aTgued that
creamery men should study the mechan
ism carefully and know all Its parts.inti
mately. The; machine should be ... kept
scrupulously clean, yet In nine out of ten
creameries this â ; Important ' item is ig
nored. The. quality of butter largely do
pends upon the separator. . Above all,
cleanliness was imperative, as_thls_not
.only preserved the parts of the machine,
but improved the quality of butter pro
duced, and lessened the expense â¢ for re
pairs, t . .' â '-' . â¢-/,. â¢ ; . â¢'â¢ - .
â¢ E. H. Zimmerman of "Watsonville spokn
briefly on the subject of "Cleanliness in
the Creamery." He said cleanliness was
next to godliness, and that if- this law
were observed mueh better success â¢' to
creamery men would be assured.
W. M. Turner of Sierraville called at
tention to the importance of holding peri
odical butter contests In an address on
the subject, "Butter Contests as Educa
tors." He urged that one contest should
fce held every three months and that suit
able prizes should be offered to stimulate
the contestants to the best efforts.: The
educational advantages of such contests,
he said, are apparent. They should be
participated . In by creamery men I alone.
They would result in the production of a
superior article, thereby not only increas
ing the popular demand for the product,
but enhancing .Its market value. .,
In the discussion that followed the Idea
of butter contests was generally favored.
The or:ly difficulty, to be encountered was
the question of securing competent judges
to pass upon the merits .'of the .â produc
tions of the contestants. . "W. H." Roussel
said the tastes of "no two judges were
similar, so that their, scorings of the same
samples of .butter, would materially: dis
agree, --m:---;? â _â* ..V .'-: â¢â¢â ' -'..â â 
Professor F. A. Leighton of Newhamp
ton. la., an on butter-making,
said it was not surprising that the same
churning oÂ£ butter should. show different
degrees ,of scoring. - This | was often
caused by/the. failure of the operator to
distribute his salt property, so that one
part of the butter was properly seasoned
while another was not. In trarisporatlon
of butter to market one portion of- it
may be subjected to chemical changes by
being subjected to heat, while another
Doruon Is subjected to a different chemi-
cal change by being subjected to extreme
cold. .
Scoring of Butter Samples.
During" recess;a number of samples of
butter were scored by Professor Leighton,
who pronounced the California product
in no sense Inferior to that produced in
the East.. The samples were scored In ac
cordance with Eastern rules as to color,
flavor, salting, etc. That furnished by
Wallace M. Stevenson of San Geronlmo
scored 97% per cent. The sample of the
Lyon Jersey Creamery of Alameda scored
D7 per cent. This, according to Professor
Leighton, was a remarkable showing for
California butten â 
The principal address of the afternoon
session was by Dr. Archibald A. Ward
of the State- University on the subject,
"Bacteriology as Applied to Creamery,
Work." He explained at length the bac
teria which infest the milk and outlined
the best methods of providing pure milk.
Cleanliness in milking was urged as the
first consideration. Under the most fa
vorable circumstances milk is never ab
solutely free from, bacteria more or less
harmful to consumers, but when dust and
other Ingredients axe permitted to con
taminate it, the dangers from bacteria are
largely increased. Stables in which milk
ing is done should be clean and free from
filth. Water in â  which cows arÂ© allowed
to / wade should always be flowing and
never, be stagnant. The greater percen
tage of bacteria in milk is communicated
by impurities falling therein during the
process of milking. Cleanliness in the care
of..utensils was also Imperative. In Den
mark the butter-makers invariably Pas
teurized their milk, thereby relieving it
of all. bacteria save that which is natur
ally introduced into It before being drawn
from the cow. The use of preservaline in
milk was strongly condemned by the
speaker as being harmful to the con
sumer.
J. E. ' Thorp spoke on the subject, "As
sisting Our Patrons to Make Their.Busi
ness Profitable," and George E. Peoples
followed with some pertinent remarks on
"Practical Self-Education of the Cream
ery Operator." C. F. Andrews of Point
Arena pointed out the conveniences re
quired in creamery, construction and
equipment. . , â¢
Samuel Martin of the firm of Martin,
Dangers. Camm & Co., informed the dele
gates that the produce merchants of San
Francisco would do all in their power to
assist the creamery men of California in
.making butter on scientific principles. He
hoped that a greater general interest
would be shown in the dairy school at
Berkeley. The speaker warmly indorsed
the appointment by the State of a dairy
inspector. *
Important Resolutions Adopted.
were made by Fred Helraer.
R; Sheldon, W. J. Langstaff, W. H. Rous
sel and W. H. McArthur. Professor Le
roy Anderson then submitted the report
of the committee on resolutions, which
was unanimously adopted. The principal
recommendations of the committee are
as follows: j
_ That, the members of this association uae

such laws by our State Legislature as will give
the State bureau authority and funds to carry
on the inspection of dairies > and creameries

tion of pure and wholesome milk and prevent
the adulteration of milk and milk products.
' That we unre upon the next State Legisla

appropriations to the University of California
to enable it to erect, equip and maintain a

BALLOT PAPER
CASE APPEALED
State. Secretary Curry's
' Exorbitant Charge â¢
Resisted.
Election Commission Will
Take Case to Supreme
Court. , - â¢ .
The Board of Election Commissioners
directed City Attorney Lane yesterday to
appeal the suit of Secretary of State
Curry against the city and county of San
Francisco for payment of a bill for ballot
paper furnished at the election in 1899.
Payment on the bill was refused because
Curry charged at the rate of 12^2 cents
per pound, when, testimony was secured
that the paper was worth only &A cents
in open market.
Curry brought suit on behalf of the
State in the Sacramento Superior Court
for the recovery of the amount of the bill
at the 12^-cent â  rate. Judgment was ren
dered in favor of the State for the full
amount claimed, but the case is by no
means ' settled.
The Election Commission, in ordering
an appeal to the Supreme, Court,' is of the
opinion that Curry charged this city an
exorbitant price for the ballot paper and
will leave no stone unturned to prove
that it is right in its contention. It was
the sense of the commission that if the
higher court should uphold the decision
of â  the Superior Court, then the Legisla
ture will be appealed to. A petition will
be filed requesting that the Secretary of
State be compelled to invite competitive
bids in the purchase of ballot paper, so
that the lowest bidder will be awarded
the contract. In this manner a fair price
only will be exacted for the paper.
The Election Commission was supported
by the Board of Supervisors at the time
of its refusal to pay the high price
charged by the Secretary of State. An
exhaustive investigation was held, at
: which the testimony of paper merchants
was produced to show that the paper
was worth. 6^4 cents a pound instead of
12% cents. The board thereupon passed
an ordinance authorizing the payment of
the bill at the rate of 6*4 cents per pound.
This action was overruled by the Supe
rior Court and the Supreme Court will be
invoked to decide the disputed point.

Union Iron Works Will Settle.
The Union Iron "Works yesterday filed a
confession of judgment in the suit
brought against the corporation by Mr3.
Delia B. Powers and her children, in
which they sought to obtain $250 damages.
The husband, Michael Powers, was killed
by a falling beam while in the company's
employ. The company acknowledges all
the allegations in the complaint and will
pay the sum asked for.

priation provide not only for a dairy school,
but for a farm of sufficient size and conveni
ence to make possible as good instruction in
the care and handling: of all kinds of farm
animals that the nation affords. |
That this association urges upon Congress
the passage or the Grout Mil, or its substi
tute, regulating: the sale of oleomargarine;
that letters be sent by the president and sec
retary to each of the California representatives
in Congress urging their support of this meas
ure, and that if It be deemed expedient by
the executive committee and it the finances
of the association permit, a substantial ap
propriation be made from the association funds
to the National Dairy Union to assist it in the
fight for the passage of the Grout bill.
"W. H. Turner of the committee on but
ter contests reported in favor of holding
four contests a year. The matter was re
ferred to the executive committee.
After some further expressions of good
will on the part of local commission men
toward the association an adjournment
was taken. The affair closed with a ban
quet at 118 California street at 6 o'clock.
Covers for sixty were laid and many of
the leading dairy produce merchants were
present as invited guests. President Lyon
served as toastmaster. The affair was a
happy one for all concerned.

SAYS GREGGLEY
MEANT TO SLAY
Bartender Has an Excit
ing Time Christmas
Morning.
"John Doe" Greggley. a man who car
ries pistols and pops' them oft on ill-timed
occasions, has his name on a warrant
sworn to by James O. Scully, a barkeeper
in Joseph Harney's saloon, 1656 Market
street. Scully wants Greggley arrested
on a charge ol assault to commit murder.
Before Judge Mogan Scully told his woe
ful story yesterday and showed a slngftd
eyebrow and two cartridges aa confirma
tion to his tale.
According to Scully, Greggley occupies
an office on MarKet street and- is an
agent for diamonds and seltzer water at
tne same time. For some weens he piayed
tne part of a steady patron of the saloon
in which Scully worKs. On Cnristmad
morning he two-stepped up to tne bar,
and catching sight of a outton in the
lapel of Scuny's coat began to free him
self of certain opinions that Scully vows
to be insulting. The button has pictured
upon it the young lady to whom bcully Is
betrothed. Oreggley was ordered out of
the saloon in a nurry.
Late in the afternoon Greggley re
turned, smitten to the core and con
science-stricken for what he had said.
In return for absolution he offered to
"treat the house," which was quite empty
at the time. Scully was not ot a mina to
assimilate apologies, so he ordered the
insurer out. (jreggley grew boisterous
at this point and wnipped a couple of re
volvers out of his pocket, pointing them
at Scully's face. Scully dodged, tne pis
tols went 'off and the bystanders quickly
disarmed the celebrating Greggley, who
was promptly kicked Into the street.
Scully also alleged that Greggley th3
same afternoon attempted to shoot I,. P.
Weaver, manager for the Studebakcr
Brothers* Manufacturing Company, and
a man named Pfendergast. They hap
pened to be near the saloon when he was
kicked out. Greggley, Scully said, had
called upon him Thursday afternoon and
had, he said, offered to give him a valu
able diamond ring If he would not prose
cute him.
EUNAWAY ON LABKIN
STREET CAUSES TERROS
Horses Dragging- a Milk Wagon Dash
Down Street and Create
Consternation.
Shouts of warning, rattling milk bottles
and the loud clatter of a runaway horse
attached to a dairy wagon offered enough
excuse for the hasty retreat to safety on
the part of men, women and children yes
terday afternoon on Larkin street. It was
during the busy shopping hours when one
of the wagons belonging to the Oakland
dairy, doing business at 320 Fulton street,
came dashing along.
There was no driver on the wagon and
at first it was feared that he had been
thrown off. The* excitement increased
when at the corner of Post and Larkin
streets the horse swerved and suddenly
dashed toward Henry A. Schultze's gro
cery store, 929 Larkin street, but here the
animal was brought to a halt by coming
into collision with one -of Schultze's;
wagons. Several men rushed to the
horses' heads and prevented - both from
going on a stampede. Schultze's wagon
was damaged, both shafts being smashed,
and the harness almost torn from the
horse. The driver of the milk wagon
gave the excuse that he had tied his
iiorse to a post for the purpose of feed
ing him, when the animal was suddenly
startled, broke away and bolted. Had
the runaway come in contact with a car
which had a moment Def ore turned the
corner there would have been a bad
smash-up. An elderly man on crutches,
who was crossing the street at the time,
narrowly escaped being run over.
Old Suit Decided.
The protracted litigation resulting from
a . suit instituted by J. Howard " Smith
against W. H. Martin et ah, directors of
the Ferries and Cliff House Railway, to
recover $3500 paid for stock alleged to be
practically valueless, was ended yester
day by . a decision of the Supreme Court
in favor of the tlefendants. The court did
not pass upon the question as to whether
Smith had been defrauded, but held that
he had forfeited his opportunity of secur
ing judgment because of Inexcusable de
lay in making a legal investigation of the
value of the property after he had pur
chased It. J -â¢.;!â¢â >â ::. â =;
