1-iuli Individuality Ih un uncumprornis-
teg fact and has to bo takeiÂ» Into consld
â¢ration, and though brothers and sisters
owe Identically the same debt to heredity
all the way back to Adam, they usually
seem to have taken advantage of the wide
choice offered by the multitudinous fam
ily connection to Inherit the most oppo
site traits and often most antagonistic
natures. The law of "the attraction of
oppoaltes" In matrimonial selection also
complicates the domestic problem, and,
unfortunately, relationship is not a talis
man for affection.
To harmonize tempers and disposition*
teuch love is required, but there is no oth
er such emollient to allay irritability, no
such check to petty disagreements or to
Interference with personal liberty between
brothers and sisters, ro like bar to rude
ness on the part of chi'dren and servants,
as the habitual observance of the rules
of politeness which we instinctively follow
with strangers. ,â â ';,'â 'â  ,
Sources of Family Discord.
The a b c of good manners demands
that ire soften the asperity of criticism,
but home truths have often a freedom
and frankness peculiarly exasperating
Altercation about trifles la a fruitful
source of friction, and stock subjects of
disputation beget a chronic ."touchiness."
One seldom convinces by excited and
voluble argument, and when a suspicion
of temper appears gjod-by to success!
Politeness compels a conciliatory , man
ner, an open-minded hospitality to t'to
views of others, which will be most ef
fective If our object be to influence rather
than to vent our irritation. "Peace at any
price" is a good family motto.
Some persons keep advice for gratuitous
distribution, and give it at such length
and with such energy that ail free agen
cy seems lost to tho one addressed. A
well-bred reticence should bo exercised
both in asking qccstlonb and offering ad
vice, respecting every one's natural de
9lre for independent thought and action.
The elders aro apt to dogmatize, expect
ing their views to b* accepted without
question, forgetting that their correctness
Is not eo evident to those whose minis
have not paused through the eamo jpro
cesses. "' 'â :'. â¢"â  â  ';X) â '.', 'â¢â¢ â¢."â '; ..
There are people who seem to think
that no ono Is entitled to a placo
in the world hut thos<Â» of whom they
approve. These self-constttutcd critics
0.to uaually the least patient of criticism
when directed toward themselves. â 'â We
cannot expect all the world to live up to
our M.iiicJarrlx, nor expect of others what
It is not In them to be. How tlresomoly
monotonous nil the world would be! A
wise' power has made no two alike. Ah
well condemn the roue for not being aÂ»
useful uÂ» the cabbage!
Family "Good Form."
One thing good form imperatively do
mandM, that by no mlnehunce, no lows of
Keif-control, shall family discords be re
vealed to strangers, children or servuntH.
If there bo friction that may develop Into
a nkirrrslsh, let It bÂ« deferred, at whatever
cost to eelt-reprcHiilon, and resumed, If
need be, behind closed doom. '
An uncontrolled voice in always unman
nerly. It Is wise not to ullow a point at
iHSue to become too Important. . '
Homo persons always wlnh to shurn their
small iilliiHMtH und require un audience
for their KUffcrlngH. A French woman
once exclaimed with comic pathos, "Tulk
of the patience of M. Job! Any woman
whose husband has had a cold In the html
is entitled to a like Immortal reputation!"
A readiness to give up in little thing* 1.4
the most tactful appeal possible for a re
turn of courtesy. at other times when tho
matter may be of Importance to us.
It is a high attainment in politeness to
allow others to be mistaken. Lot a trifling
misatatement pass unnoticed where no
principle Is involved, and when a mistake
Is past remedy, it Is best to let the subject
drop. The argument of the "I told you
so'.' character Is quite superfluous.
That irritability can be controlled and
that Instantly I* proved bjÂ» the celerity
with which frowns vanish and tho voice
takes on tones of genial cordiality at Ihu
unexpected appearance of some acquaint-""
arice with whom we wish to stand well.
The paradox is hard to explain thatâ ,
We vex our own by look and tone.
Yet we lore our own the beet,
â¢ ~ - %
May it not be that in tho world of so
ciety politeness has become second na
ture? It Is there instinctive to put. re
straint upon ourselves, to hide whatever
will not be pleading to others and to shov/
ourselves at our beet and brightest, but
in the seclusion ' of home we dare to be
barbarians, still trusting to love to stund
the strain.
Nothing is more contagious than tem
pers, good and bad. There are somo un

Raphael that Ill-humor could not live In

{"I^IIE royal hand of Quern Victoriaâ

which had been given to Prince Albert
on the happy day of the >:reat marriage
ceremony. It wun his hand, by rights, ho
raid, and ha wanted It modeled.
So Sluii'ir Malhcrbl betook himself to
the castle, and wont to work wJth such
pains that the enst was 'almost spoiled.
Slgnor Mulhrrbl owned afterward that he
wan what we call "rattled." In tho end
he rallied.
It was mÂ» beautiful a hand! Ills Italian
fiiihtisliiHni gurgled and bubbled and
gushed.' It wns Indeed the hand of a
queen. \
White and dainty, he said It was, as bu
ilt h aristocracy. Firm und forceful, be
sides, u befit* the ruling power of a great
nation. And the beauty of tho hand ap
pealed to the artist eye. It wan so snowy
and tho iiiiUh were si delicately rosy and
the HfMh wan so llrmly plump. Tho lln-
Bers tapered, tooâ not quite ho much ns
the artlHt eye would have delighted In,
but there had to be some executive ability
In the shape, of the tlnger tips for the
Â«ako of the palmlHtH. They could never
have permitted Queeu Victoria to be a
dreamer.
The cant was entirely sucoeBHful and
tin- Prince Consort treasured It uh long as

almost as much precision- as he ..could
have done from her living hand.
Show it to him and tell him that it Is
the hand of ciisan Smith, who was an
unsuccessful seamstress, and ho will tell
you that he uoesn't believe you. The
owner of thut hand could not- have been
unsuccessful, he. will say.^ There is too
much will power In the broad thumb Joint
âbroad far beyond the average In wom
an. Soo it alone and It might be taken
for that of a man.
The joint of logic is long, too. It Is sup
plemented by u deep, clean-cut headline
â that keeps bravely away from the mount
of Imagination, whither other headlines
of the sex nro wont to tend.
These are all qualities more pertaining
to u man than a woman. Add to them
the trcnundous umbltlon nnd independ
ence, In the foiellnger. the determination
in the back-turnod thumb, the buslneu
ability In the Uttlo tlngVri and you might
fancy that hero was aV'nctir woman" with

tt^iv" of the puUn. There, says (he putra-
1st is a " lack - a total lack.' of fight."
Tho owner of this hand wo ; uhl be of a
most peace-loving' disposition.
How is that for a reading?
. But. after all, what the palmist has to
say matters very little now that the hand
has written its own history and the ttme
of prophecy Is past. Victoria lived to
show what the band could do. It fulfilled
the duties of the Queen and of the wom
an. It pinned medals of honor upon the
breast of the .soldier.' It was outstretched
to the poor and the suffering. It signed
papers that dlnfted national currents of
affairs. Diplomats hung upon its ges
tures. Strong ir.en were swayed by them.
If the little Alameda girl who has its
counterpart thinks of all these things
when she looks at it perhaps it will live
to point many n mural, even if it is only
a "cast hand."

3THE LATEST
FASHION
NEW YORK
Here are the latest frills and fashions for Holiday attire and
some of the rich gowns of New Ycrk's and Washington's s wellest
set axe folly described. What Miss Alice Eoosevelt, MiBs Van Alen,
Mrs. Henry Clews and others will wear. <
{"""WHEY are cutting 1 and shipping, shap-
I Ing and stitching upon* the gown
1 I that is to be worn Christmas, time.
I To. make a Christmas gown Is now
X as much a custom with tho modern
â woman as to have an Easter hat and It
Is sure that she spends more time plan
ning It.
The Christmas gown Is a house gown,
or one that Is to be worn Indoors. It ia
designed for one of many occasions and
In selecting it a woman takes her chofce.
Kithcr she will have a new frock for a
Christmas dinner party, or, forgetting the
dinner, she will Indulge In one for an
evening's entertainment, whether It be a
dance, a reception, a "party," as the card
affairs are caWed, or for mere emergency.
No mutter what the gown may be, nor
the occasion for which It Is Intended, It
mum be a picture eown. Without this
qualillcation.lt will not answer any of the
requirements of the Yule. Gowns stow,
Instead of less plcture-Uke, more and
more bo, and it really begins to look as
though the " picture" came first and the
gown afterward.
For the Christmas dinner, which is rare-
It a very stately affair, there may be a
dinner gown with dressy attributes, with*
out actual elegance, but- it must have
some characteristic distinction, if It be
no more than old lace.
Borne difference exists In the time of
serving of the Christmas dinner. In New
York It is almost universally set forth at
6 o'clock. In other parts of the country It
comes at noon and in many families It In
served at a between hours, that Is, at 3
o'clock.
For the day dinner the dark silk Is now
the proper gown. It Is a season of silk
gowns and very demure and subdued the
silk looks, made up Into a deml-traln
and bodice. In yellow brown there are
many pretty gowns. One had a trimming
of black lace around the skirt with white
chiffon pulled through tho lace under
neath, so that It showed through tho lace.
Above It there was a little block velvet
trimming. Black velvet was put on In
little rosettes, not one larger than a dime.
It took dozens to go around the skirt.
All the browns are in for dress pur
poses, and In the glace taffetas thero I."
a wide variety of tonu.i. Homo ono do
dares that there aro forty deslrablo
bhudes, running from a deep tan brown
to tho Invisible seal. Tnbacco Is the fa
vwritf, with autumn leaf brown aud tte
Drown of the butternut coming' close
after.
Kor all these brown silks there is tho
block lace trimming, oi the trimming of
white lace, and there are the passemente
ries, which Id some form or other look so
well upon the skirts of the year. â¢ â --â¢ -
For the early dinner there should be no
attempt at the low neck, the dress ex
perts tell us, and noi even the square
neck should be attÂ«mi-t<-d. But there is
something no attractive about the square
neck, so positively homelike, that at such
a formal affair as the Christmas dinner
many ladles are willing to waive - ques
tions of ceremony and etiquette and don
the costume that Is prettiest and tli* ono
In which they, would be remembered tho
whole year. If tho dining-room be dark
ened and lighted artificially then tho mod-
Ifled square neck Is appropriate, even in
the middle of the day. â¢ â , -
For CeremoniousJDlnners.
The late Christmas dinner In one that
caJls for all tnt ceremony of the moat
ceremonious of dinner:*. It Is a dinner for
grown people and the children are ban
ished therefrom. At this dinner the moat
beautiful creations are worn, ami. It Is for
Juat such an occasion that the modlstea
ore exerting thcrnselvct. to the utmost.
A Christmas dinner gown to bo worn by
Mrs. Henry CIcwk Is a dcllKhtful thing In
black and blue. Tho two colors urn mixed
and mingled and combined In a Frenchy
v.uy that Is most catching. It In dlfilcult
In theso days of cntre deux of emplece
rnents or applications, of Insertions and
underlays, to accurately describe a gown,
but In looking at this drcsn of bltm and
black one gets the UlUk that tho black
Is made up underneath the blue, which
falls over it. â â â¢â .< >.
The black acts as a drop skirt and,
where there are opening* In-the blue, the
black shows through. Each opening is
covered by its patch of lacÂ«. Around the
lace there is the most delicate little trim
ming of pale blue ribbon. â  .'.
The French knot plays an Important
part in all ceremonious dinner gowns.
There is a way of making these know
so that they will stand out and form \\
trimming. . They give tho effect of that
essential to all good gowning, embroid
ery, ar.d the French knot diversifies the
surface of: some, of the handsomest of
silks, brocaded and plain. .'- .â¢â >â 
. The brocaded crepo de chines are cre
ating somewhat of a sensation. The
groundwork' Is u crepe do chine, but tho
brocaded tiguro Is In silk and It creates
an "atmosphere," as the French artists
say, which Is elegant In tho extreme. - '
The new fabrics, while undeniably beau
tiful,.are not necessarily expansive, and
for a little one can create a Christmas
gown that wo*uld in former Reasons Â«havÂ«
cost much more, yet the effect will bo
quite the same. " . _. â  '
â¢ Tho Uses of Lace. ,
For dinner gowns there are the lace re
sults; they can be called by no other
name. I^a'ce of not too- elegant a quality
Js appllqucd with lace figures, cut bodily
out or very pretty pieces of lace, and
around these lace figures there are chuB-
Ings of passementerie, or of ribbon, or of
mock Jeweled braid; AH flowers seem In
some mysterious way to havo an outline
and, from the brocaded silk which has
Its brocade defined with threudit of sil
ver, to* the lace Which needs something,
If no more than a bit of colored Bilk un
derneath, to bring it out, figures ure mado
prominent.* ' â¢ -
Dinner gowns, thus elaborated and made
beautiful with handiwork, become actual
creations and one must be pardoned for
dwelling upon them. \* â¢ - .
.'The pompadour silks come In for their
share of praise. They are golly flowered
and some of the newest ones show the
flowers in tiny sprays that do not moke
one look so Immense as the big bouquets
were'prono-to do. .-â .,,>
'â ' The little corn , colored backgrounds',
with very. small' bouquets of flowers scat*
tered over them,' can bo made up Into lit
tle dinner, gowns, that are positively un
rivaled for daintiness. Nor Is It the youth
ful only who can wear them, but upon
those who have arrived at the years of
discretion, who have usually demanded
dark colors, they look well, for there In
something quaint arid picturesque about
them which recommends them to all.
A pompadour silk will be worn at a din
ner soon by Miss Van Alen, the helms*
daughter of J. J. Van Alen, tho young
woman to whom all the titled of Kumpn
have been reported engaged. Including
Prlnco llcnrl a'Orleans. Miss Van Alcu'tt
gown will have a background of sky bluo
silk, while upon it will be the daintiest
little iioH(>Â»;ayB in dwarf roses with Kroou
leaves and little cowslips scattered
through,
The flowers will be much -smaller thanlife size and tied with, the narrowest 'of
ribbons. "A pretty feature of this bouquet
is that the nosegays aro "tied" with ac
tual velvet ribhoiiH, us narrow as u cord,'
sewed to the vllk In a sort of applique. jT
Realism Is coming :nto gowns. Instead
of seeming to wear r.e are to actually
wear. Buttons that, button something
trim our gowns, and buckles that will un
buckle. This Is noticed upon the stocks
and belts, thnt worn once fastened with
an Invisible climp underneath, while u
dummy bucklo ornamented the top. Now
ono - must buckle ani pull the good.*
through, as a strap, and make it fast
with a good sharp tugging. It wears 'out
the materlul sooner, but there Is a lit look
about it that Is very attractive..
In the matter of buttons, even upon din
ner gowns, ono notices their realism. If
there is a button anywhere you can look
for a place that Is to unbutton, and one
of the very newest fads for dinner waists
shown wide pointed revere that lap over
and button, â¢ On one nine is a big button
and on the other a big buttonhole. .When
you wish to clono the front of the waist
so as to hide tho vest you doublo the
points, one over the ether, and button*
them. â  - â  â¢ â  ' .
Bo In the matter of decorations, stripes
and brocades, nquaren, checks and platda.
1'lnlds are put In by actually plalding
ribbons or plalding bands of silk ojvclpth;
and stripes are mado by using ribbon
and braid In such a way as to stripe the
wklrt. Squares are formed In the gams
way, by hand-sewing, and brocades arn
brocaded visibly, either by appltquntng fig
ures upon the surfaco of tho goods or by
tracing tho figures nr.d making them
worn conspicuous by outlining them with
narrow ribbons, with gold cords or with
â Ilk stitching and embroidery.
' An Ag4 of Realism. !
"That which seems to bÂ« mast be
there," Is the rule In dress trimmings and
In dress figure*; and to vet results you
must put them there with needle and
thread. It Is dreadfully hard upon the
Woman who Is not sifted with the noodle,
but she who haa talent In her fingers
profits by this style, for sho can havo that
Which her wealthier plater enjoys with no
more cost than she would bo willing to
expend anyway upon a gown.' â¢
The practical use of narrow ribbon is as
yet only half understood. Women take
hold of the Paris. creations and murmur,
"How beautiful!" without knowlngjivhy.
An extrulptte thing In claret colored taf
feta was a network of baby ribbon, which
was crossed und Intertwined, yet always
It preserved some semblunce of a pattern.
The ribbon was turned to make it lie
more gracefully like a leaf that turns In
the wind, with half its side doubled under.
The shirred ribbon effects cannot be
overestimated. Narrow ribbon is shirred
along each edge and the string Is pulled
until it makes a puffing. This is then used
as ti trimming and very beautifully it
takes form In Its various guisea. There
arc .coses, in the Imported creations,
where shirred ribbon is made to look like
brocade and Is applied in figure form, the
shirring laid sldo by side and then sep
arated to give a curious undulating effect.
It would neem as though anything at all
could bo done if one had the Bmall ma
terials and the patience.
Picture effects In evening gowns are
much more easily obtained than In gowns
that are for dinners only. In the evening
dress there is the candle -light and tho
Miadow to help it out, and there Is .also
the. peculiar exhilaration of night. There
Is something about an evoning gown that
Is understood by all but expressed . by
none. No woman but will tell you that an
old gown can be made over for evening,
and none but will trust to the light and
the little livings to make it presentable.
Evening Stuffs.
The panne materials, silk, velvet and
doth, are all very admirable for evening.
There are the softer veilings, the cash
meres In very ' thin qualities, the can
vases of silk and' albatrosses anil the
Oriental stuffs, all within easy rocket
reAch of the woman who doBlres them.
For those who can claim a share of
youth thero are picture gowna that aro
lovely In the extreme. And there Is this
about them, that they make a mature flgÂ»
ure look more youthful.
Take an essentially evening gownâ a pic
ture gownâof Inexpensive liberty silk.
The waist 1a made with a curious shirred
. or folded effect across the front, the folds
going from side to side. The sleeves were
folded In . the same way, with the - folds
running around the arm. There was no
Hnish to the sleeve, not even a drop or
lace. . but the folds encased the arms and
enwrapped them in the most picturesque
manner. â  â¢â â â¢. â  : ~ -.-â¢?-â â¢â  â  'â â â :. . ;.
The nock was even more simple in de
sign, for it was made pointed, front and
back, with the point as low as four or live
Inches beneath the chin. A very deep
lace was laid around the neck and brought
down to a grandmother's point In front,
where it was fastened with an American
Beauty rose. . ..â¢,â ;â¢ â Â» - â  -
Such lovely effects are obtained wllh 1
American Beauties. They do not wither
and, if bought in the bud, ready to open,
they -will â¢ - very gradually spread their
leaves, â¢ until at midnight they are lovely
and decorative In the extreme and just
suited to their work of adornment, when
flowers other than the American Beauty
would hnve begun to wither. . â¢
The skirt of such a gown as this, with
waist folded In horizontal folds, may have
tucked hips, while the skirt flares and be
comes very modern around the foot, hav
ing thnt great sweep which Is so much de
sired nowadays.
Long Frail Skirts.
For evening occasions, â  whether for
dancing or for full dress receptions, the
train Is worn and the consequences en
dured. The long frail skirt' with Its frou
frou of silk flounclnga. Its cascades of
chiffon Turnings, its billows of lace and
its KwLsh-swlsh of dellcato net, its lace
and diaphanous creationâ all lies upon the
floor ready to be stopped upon.
It is a season of ruinous consequences
and many a woman comes home with
train in tatters, while to his home goes
a man disgraced. The matter of the deli
cate long train was seriously discussed lu
a Fifth avenue mansion not long ago,
with the result that all decided that It
was necessary, though a thousand pities.
On an occasion, immediately following,
tho house was crushed with- guests, and
lying In their court stateltness upon the
lloor, occupying more space than - the
guests, were the winding trains, serpen
tining their lengttu* between the very foot
of thoso who came and went.
The great sash and the small sa^h are
both here. 'The.' former is made out of
â¢wide ribbon, liberty, or two faced, satin,
and' la - brought around the waist and -
knotted : on â¢ the I side. If it Is an empire
sash, and there are many such this year,
it is knotted a. little bit higher than the
waist, and '.the ends hang long and low.
The loops are rather short and stand out
quite, stiffly. ~- â¢. ; . Â» â¢â ."'.,â¢
â  The short loop Is characteristic of the
new sash. It starfOs out at right angles
to - the' ends and has something 'of- the*
prim look of an old-time sashribbon. .
Miss Alice ' Roosevelt, who is generally
a very mature young lady in:her style of.
dress, wore ' a few days ago a sash tied _
In the back with loops and ends, in a veiy
girlish ! fashion.; The ends were : wide and
hung low. They were cut.'. not. slanting,
but rounded, - and were very pretty -in
their- broadness, unrelieved* by â¢ a particle
of decoration. " . , â¢ -.â â¢-_. v " " -

A sash with embroidered ends. was worn
by. a Brooklyn beauty, who tied it in the

very floor. * \* -
The chiffon sashes are very â  desirable,
and much can be done with them. One of
these consists of a widlh. of chiffon wUh
a little double white Tsatin niching: upon
each edge. The niching -was : carried
around the entire length of the .chiffon.
The sash was then tie^ in a very easy
fashion, or, rather, was not, tied at all,
but merely crossed and fastened with a
pretty pin. â¢ : ,
In air the picture gowns and other
gowns a change is noted in the treatment
of the front of the watat. No more is it
brought down to a deep point, but- the
point, while decided, is inclined . to be
shallow. Occasionally there is no point
at nil, but a rounding effect.
The point Is produced not so much by
pulling down the material in front as by
shortening the. back. The waist or belt Is
pulled up a little In the middle of the
back, and the. back is -made rounding 1 and
broader. The- front Is then pressed low
and thus the point Is secured.
The French, who claimed to be the flret
ones to Introduce the pointed front, now
disclaim It to a certain effect. Said a fa
mous French dressmaker: . .
"Wo are responsible for the elongated
waist ami the straight front corset, but
that is all. â  v â¢ ' .
"The day when tho plump womanâ the
woman with no vtalstâ begran to pull down

WOMAN'S
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RELIGIOUS DELUSIANS
OMB one questions if women are
V3. more given religious delusions
V j or "fads'* than men, and if so,
Â£~" why? An old definition of the word
. ' "fad" is "a bundle of straw." Not
a very dangerous thing, unless, indeed, a
spark fall upon It from something already
ablaze. If the blazing thing be a woman's
opinion, a woman's conviction, . well
foucded or unfounded, even a fad becomes
a torch that leads or misleads, scintUlates
or radiates, dazzles, scorches, smlrchis.or
warms, so long as the glowing thins may
. be made to seem something other and of
more value than straws. '
. The French language gives to our va
rious hobbles and whims, our Insipid fld
dlefaddle - ideas and fancies, the name
"fadalse." In ifacaulay's life and letters
. we flhd the great writer declaring his
sympathy' with Jeffrey in his contempt
"for the fadalse of the bluestocking litera
ture." Notwithstanding these notes oC
contempt from over the sea our own dic
tionary exalts the word to a place of some
dignity when it admits that a fad may be
more than "a trivial 'matter pursued with
irrational zeal." and calls it "an im
portant matter Imperfectly understood,
often urged with more zeal than sense.'' ;
Now since the imperfect understanding !
and the zealous," senseless pusuit do not
belong to the fad at all, but' to the per
son espousing 'it, we have sifted out of
the various definitions the fact that a fad,
however - or misunderstood,
however unwjsely defended, may be "an*
important thing.'*. : If, then, our ques
tioner bad asked, '"Are women less keen
in discriminating .between the important
aid -the unimportant than are men?"
it might be difficult to say. But our ques
tion is, "Are'women more given, to reli
gious delusions than men?" and to- this
query no- caref ur observer. oif the various
religious movements that have claimed
recent -attention m our own and' other
countries can hesitate to answer "Yes."
We have only, to let the mind follow
along the procession of believers in every
'great 'ism* and *ology and 'osophy under
.the sun, from those who gave heed to the
utterances -Â»hat crept from under the
pokebonnet of the early Shaker Ann to
those 'who hung on the wards of wisdom
issuing from the yellow turbaned monks
of the Orient,_ to . know that the long
ranks are largely feminine not in num
bers only but In loyalty and in zeal. Sail
enough this fact if the fads they espouse
MOST WONDERFUL FEATS OF DARING
THK recent' remarkable feat of Mrs.
Anna K. Taylor In going over, the
Ilorn-Khoe Falls of Niagara In u
barrel recalls other thrilling Â«*x-
I>er!ences ana performances at Ni
agara. The Indian legend connected with
Ntngara asserts that the .Indians who
dwelt in that vicinity worshiped Jhe
Gnat Spirit of the Falls, their worship
culminating nnnually In' the sacrifice. of
the fairest maiden gX the tribe to the'
Great Spirit of NIagafa, laden with fruit
and flower* Since then many lives have
been sacrificed, voluntarily or Involun
tarily, in the mighty current, and many
deed* of daring attempted and performed
there for the sake of notoriety or monay.
The following Instances of this kind are
taken from "The Niagara Book," by W.
D. Howtlu*. Mark Twain, Professor Na
thaniel S. Shaler and others, â¢ collected
in a chapter entitled "Dramatic Inci
dents," written by Orrln K. Dunlop:
During the final twenty years of the
last century, say Mr. Dunlop, the ef
forts to attain notoriety through somj
Niagara feat were perhaps more fre
quent that ever betore. but as far back
as 1327 Niagara wax recognized as an
lilt ul place where grÂ«-ut crowds might be
HKsembit'd by thrilling incidents. About

prove, only useless bundles of straw. One
straw shows the way of â  the wind; a
bundle may show the drift of united cur
rents of sympathy, sentiment or convic
tion. If these are valueless, then it is
only a question of time when the fire
caught, remember, from the woman and
not from the fadâ becomes a consuming
fire. Aucn the whole thing goes up In
smoke, tainting the pure air for a little,
but swept away soon â  or late by that
wind whose silent coming and going wo
do not always hear, but that "bloweth
where it llsteth," and always to make tho
foul air pure. â  . >
It would be foolish to deny that ex
treme phases of religious teaching have
always found many . devoted followers
among women. In every abnormal move
ment they not only outnumber men but
outrank them In advocacy nnd outdo
them in. sacrifice for whatever cause has
won their allegiance. But. admitting tho
fact of woman's greater devotion is not
necessarily an admission of her greater
weakness and credulity. The very quali
ties which make women victims and .de
fenders alike of new and unpopular Ideas
make them afso faithful wives .to un
lucky men, devoted mothers to ailing chll
' dren and loyal supporters of .unfortunate
friends. A' good woman's hunger to give
her best to the best she knows keeps her.
â  ever on the alert for something better
than' she* has yet discovered. Her dls
3 content with much ot her religious teach
ing Is not always unworthy; indeed, it Is
sometimes a divine discontent./ If she
falls to- enjoy .the .mild .'essays too fre
quently offered in the guise of instruction
an J admonition, she may not. op?nry re
bel at her portion of spiritual food; she
may even .blame herself for her lack of
assimilation, yet she knows perfectly well
she is or fÂ»-not strengthened by the diet
prepared for her soul. But however con
scious she may be of < her. unsatisfied hun
ger, â * the good woman Is rarely iconoclas
tic: she is usually glad if the religious
Instruction proves the bread of life to
other souls. For herself, if. she liÂ« honest
hearted and truly hungers and thirsts af
ter righteousness, the Is surely going to
take a nibble and -a sip at whatever
seems to promise fullness for 'the empti
ness of her aching heart and brain. , Ks
peclally Is she going to taite for herself
the bread and* the cup which some ocher
woman tells her the has. found sufficient
for her own need. Among women there
don, as was the intention. Coaches left
liutTulo on the afternoon of the *th ol
September to accommodate the crowds,
and all the Niagara hotels were full of
guests. . ."
Among the crowd drawn to the falls by
this Incident was Sam Patch, a man who
had won fame at Pawtucket Falls and
other Eastern points as a high Jumper.
He erected a platform at the water's
edge of the debris slope. Just north of
the Diddle Stairs, and from this platform
leaped into the river, the height of thÂ«
jump being about ninety feet. Patch was
considered a wonder, but shortly after
his Niagara experience he Ipst his Hfo
in a leap from the (Jenen^ Falls in
Rochester.
One of the moat during feats ever per
formed at Niagara Kali* was that of Joel
Robinson and his two associates, Macln
tyre and Jones, on June 6. 1H61. when they
voyaged through the whirlpool rapids In
the- steamer Maid of the Mist. The boat
was libeled and mortgaged to such an ex
tent that the waters of the Niagara wet.
too warm for her and Itoblimon agreed to
deliver her at a Canadian luktt port. On
the afternoon of the day mentioned, to
the surprise of all who suw tho boat, In
stead of heading over her usual course up
the river, her bow was -directed right in

of logic, with w'ell trained thinking pow
ersâwomen who study, investigate, rea

grounds; but by far the larger numbers
nre satisfied with the logic of experience,
and they arc possibly too ready to begin
with faith in somebody! else's experience
.while ' groping ' toward their own. Not
every woman will admit that she hns
eaten and has not been 'filled; we know
It when she does not think It worth
while to gather up the fragments. Not
every woman will admit that something
may be wrong â  with her own spiritual
power of assimilation, but every woman
will listen when another! tells her of a
new light that' has scattered ber.slwd
ows. a new strength that has answered
her longingsâ oven though this means a
new system of theology, a new theory of
salvation or a new conception of God.
This natural dual desire in woman, first.
to give herself, her love, her allegiance,:
her ' service, . and, second, to find some
thing great enough and good enough to
claim all she . has to bestow,' accounts,
not for all. but for much of her reckless
following after new teachers of .what
seem to her new truths. She accepts on
faith the experience, mental and bodily,
of others. For her there Is no argument
like 'Whereas I was blind, now*^ see."
To this faith, unnrfndfin that it Is on the
wrong basis, according to Scripture, she
adds virtue: that Is, 8he practices obe^
diently what she has been . taught, lets
her soul be. lighted by the torch of asso
ciation, Is drawn by the cord of. common
sympathy. She strives to add to her .vir

for it before adopting new ideas or shap

Ideas and Ideals often have no founda

But while deprecating this method, or
lack of method, let us not be supposed
to think that It pertains to women

women. "We only claim that the ranks

SCo woman need resign herself to the
t&ct that she must always have freckles,
sagging cheeks or hanging 'eyelid*. Those
defects can be removed very easily.
The surgical treatment for tightening
up loose and flabby cheeks Is partly
Â«bown here by photographs of the actual
operations.
You will notice In one picture that the
subject is being treated for sagging
cheeks. On the ride of the face. Just In
front of the ear. a. very small section of
the skin Is removed, after which the
tagged cheek is, gently raised and
smoothed, so that there Is not a line to be
seen nor a sign of sagging. Then a few
etltches are taken. The patient feels no
pain. Great care Is taken to avoid a scar.
Previous to the operation I make the
patient laugh, while I closely watch the
effect on the eyes and mouth, and so gain
Knowledge of the Eize and location of skin

â¢specially constructed for that purpose I
test the degree of relaxation of the skin
and the highest degree of tension which
the stitches will bear. In order to get a
perfect union of the edges of the skin.
After removal of the requisite amount,
the stitches, which are adapted especially
to this kind of work, must be drawn not
loo tight nor too loose, but Just sufficient
ly close to simply Join the edges of tho
skin. â ;â -.;-;; y: - :'â â -;;'
In these slight operations the usual rules
of antiseptic surgery are as rigidly ob
served as if I were goinr to do deep ab
dominal operations, instead of cuts only
through the skin. This is not because of
any danger of blood potyon, for I have yet
to learn of a single case of blood poison
resulting from my skin operations; but In
order to avoid leaving a visible scar. At
the neat of operation It Is necessary to
get healing by what Is technically known
as union by first intention, which means
without any formation of pus, to avoid
which the work must be done under the
strictest antiseptic. conditions. Indeed, It
takes longer to prepare . the skin to be
treated, and to sterilize the instruments,
my own hands arid those of my assistants,
than it does to perform the actual opera
tion. It takes only fifteen or twenty min
utes for each section of skin to be re
moved. -
I always laugh when some one asks me
the .frequent question: "Do you use
chloroform?" It 'Is an absurd question. I
suppose, though. thÂ« word . "operation"
sounds rather terrific to the uninitiated.
The truth is, my patients always sit
calmly in the chair and watch the pro
ceedings by means of a hand mirror.
They never. feel the slightest pain from
the beginning of the operation until the
stitches are In and the dressing on.
Sometimes a patient's doubt of the pos
sibility of painless removal of a section
of skin at first causes a little nervousness.
But when the skin Is removed and the
patient informed of the fact her look of
doubt, changes to one of astonishment

DO CLAMS WALK?
\ f -~ -a VEUT boy who spends his summers
p 13 In the country knows something
J' â ? about fresh-water clams.: He has.
found them abundant In every
stream and pondln his vicinity, and he
has seen collections of the shells: on the
banks, or near by, where muskrats have
gathered for a social feast at midnight.
As he grows older he will ponder deeply
upon the .unselfishness' which could
prompt and the self-control which could
enable the unpretentious muskrat to make
provision for the banquet and to share It
with ills .friends.' .He has probably no
ticed, too, that where a clam has perished

an old book, while at the remains/of a

ago how to open a clam by cutting; the
llgaturo along the back ] and ' the muscle
that holds the shell tightly together when'
the clam shuts itself up; v '
. Every such boy has seen, a long
line, or little furrow, in the sand, under
water, sometimes 'nearly straight, ; some-
times in graceful curves, and has often ;
found, at one end, the clam that made It. ,
upright on the edge, half-buried In the
sand, but perfectly, still and tightly closed.
It was walking in the sand until the boy ;
came splashing along; then "It shut up and j

THE Â£rst impression one receives
from reading the opening chapters
cf "Tristram of Hient," by Anthony
Hope, is that if the book Is to please
later it must be because of skillful
character drawing or i.ecause of interest
ing situations, and not on account of ac
quaintance with amiable people. The main
characters in the novel, with one excep
tion, prcrr.ise to be of a kind whose diÂ«
pprecsble traits are unrelieved by the
possession of any particular, virtue. But
there is a conspTete shifting of values to
ward the end of the book, and the black
crows are metamorphosed Into white
Wrns. The complete change of view
with which one has to regard the hero
before the bock is finished would create
d shock cf surprise if Air. Hope had net
had the forethaujht to make Tristram
the scion cf a family the conduct of
whose membrrs is guided not by the or

critical moment. Given this latitude oi

mother dies and he is left with the.lm
penJlng,necessity of establishing his claim
to her estate by the aid of false docu
ments. Not that the prospect of doing
this disturbs him in the least, if he can
but do it successfully. The erratic dispo
sition which Harry Tristram has Inherited
apparently includes a large amount of
moral obliquity, or rather, of moral ob
tuseness, for he seems at no time troubled
by qualms of conscience because he has
retained possession of property to which
he has no legal claim.
The real heir to the estate of Blent is
a cousin of Lady Tristram, a beautiful
pirl named Cecily Gainsborough. Harry
Tristram meets her while she is on a visit
to Ills home and falls in love with her.
Following a momentary, impulse, Harry
tells his cousin that she is really Lady
Tristram. He leaves Cecily in possession
of Blent, and then goes to London to seek
his fortune. From then on the course of
the story flows smoothly, following the
average way of a novel, to the restora
tion of Harry Tristram to his former tltlÂ«
and position. After his confession to 1 hia
cousin, Tristram blossoms out into a most

Hope has prepared more than one sur

It is surprising that ilr. Hope can write
a romance which will stir the emotions

produce novels which, save for some few
flashes of wit. never rise in theme or

which appeal neither to sympathy nor

The principal character in "The We3t

too, is a halfbrced named Machall JLa
fand. When. Lafand is a young' man he
suffers what ho considers a wrong at the
hands of some white men. He accepts
the affront in ciler.ee and with apparent
apathy, but it rankles in his soul for
year3 and leads him and fashions all his
later life in tuch a way that he may ne
revenged upon the men ho bates. Change
throws In his way a little girl, the
daughter of one of the men. Ihls child
is the daughter of a scientist. Professor
Welch, who went West in order to study
the geological formation of the Black
Hills. Welch had taken with him hia v/ife
and child, although It was at a time when
Dakota was the scene of many an In
dian massacre. The professor and bts
wife soon find praxes in the West, and
little Prue Welch falls into the hands of
Lafand, who brings her up under tha
name of Molly Lafand. The scheme of
vengeance which Lafand forms Includes
the ruin of this eirl. He brings her up
among lawless people, aimlns; to have her
grow into a coarse, disreputable woman.
When ehe has become the typo of woman
he wishes her to be, he means to tell her
of her parentage and make her under
stand all that she has lost. But LafanJ
has not counted-npon tho instincts which
generations of virtuous Puritans have be
queathed to Molly. In spite of degrading
surroundings Molly remains uncorrupted.
She renders the plans of Lafand futile
by sec-king refuge In the love of a man
who proves himself to be worthy of her
esteem and capable of leading her back
to sympathy with a lite which is hers
by birthrlKht. . ; , .
. Lafatid lives to see ell of his schemes
for revenge result in the prosperity of
those whom he pursues for many long
years. At the end he finds In a violent
death a terrible termination to hia cruelty
and wickedness. In the description of tho
death of the half-breed at tho hands of
infuriated Indians whom he has wronged
years before Mr. White shows a powyr
which augurs well for the quality of hit*
futuro work. Indeed, the entire novel
reveals a real ability to create a clear
picluro of. the Northwest when It was the
ecene of a last display of eavago force
directed against another greater forco

PROFESSOR GEORGE L. RAYMOND, the poet, and author of the
"Orator's Mfanual" nnd Painting, Sculpture and Architecture as
Representative Arts." and other works on esthetics, published by
G. P. Putnam's Sons, is said to be so much of rm expert in the meanings
of the posture3 and movements of the body that it amounts to a species
of. mind-reading. .; When he first wÂ»nt to Princeton to teach oratory, the
compulsory speaking- before the 'whole' college 4 was unpopular,; and' tho
speakers, who controlled their own orders of exercises, -attempted to
xnrvke a farce of them, once by hiring n negro band. to furnish music,
once by issuing mock schedules, and once by all addresing in fancy cos
tumes. He discovered and prevented each of 'the schemes through ob
serving the movements of those who came to him to rehearse. It is said
that it was not infrequent for him to interrupt a student when reading
or speaking a supposedly original composition or oration by saying
"This was not intended to ba an exercise in penmanship." A. few^day.3
ago. an a result of joining in the divertiscments of an evening at a sea
shore resort, he received a serious invitation to lecture on the occult
before' a city art and science club. Ho replied that if they wished ha
would be happy to lecture to them upon art, which was altogether the
best agency of which he knew through which to make the occult
cecm visible. -C- ' ' â  : : : .â¢ 'â â "',

"Pierrot and Hia Cat."
"Tho Tale of Pierrot and His Cat." by
Florence Evans, is a charming fairy story
for children. The little people, who are the
leading characters, are ordinary mortals
of tho earth; but : when they get Inio
trouble, unlike . ordinary.. "â¢â  mortals ..'they
have kind fairy friends to help them out :
of their difficulties In Buch a way that the
recital of dlRlcultlcs and happy endings
marks a very interesting llttlo romance.
The book 13 illustrated by tho most de
lightful facsimiles of water-color sketches
"by Mrs. Albertlne Randall Wheclan of
San Francisco. TheeÂ© illustrations ; by
themselvpfl give an outline of tho story of
little Pierrot, which bears a resemblance
to that of his well-known namesake. For
tunately foe' the gratification of youthful
readers, the^ story ot the Pierrot who
owned the cat has -a -happier ending than
that of the other. Pierrot, for this llttlo
modern one, falls out of love with Sofia,
tho representative of Columbine, and in
love with some one who brings his story
to a happy ending. The fairy tale, In con
nection with the Illustrations, . makes an
unusually attractive book for a child who
likes stories and pictures. (Dodge Pub

in itself, but forms \ the fifth - volume of

line, beyond two or three volumes. s But
the second book, "The Rover Boys on the

"The Rover Boys Out West." Still they

So far the boys have followed the doings
of Dick, Tom and Sam at Putnam Hall

of natural reverence In a series of medi

mon ground on which both must abide.;
The author concedes that "mind hath
its eagle flights and spirit hath Us ocean
depths.". With the great Master of Gal
ileo-ne says: "Seek and ye shall find;
ask and ye shall receive: knock and it
: shall be opened unto you." â  â 
; These meditations are uttered solely In
recognition of the fact that truth Is the
same yesterday, to-day and forever; that
her forces pervade the universe, awaiting
only eyes .that see. ears; that hear nnd

says that they are Intended for the Chrl3

GEORGE F. CRAM TURNS AUTHOR.
HEREWITH Is an Illustration from
"Mlnette," a historical novel' by
. â  the veteran publisher ' George F.
Cram. .This Is Mr. Cram's first at
tempt In fiction and Judging from the ex
cellence of his present production it aeema
unfortunate that he has not. entered thÂ«
world .of literary , romance -before.'
i "Mlnette" Is 'a vivid story of 'the lat
ter part 'of the eleventh century when" 8Q
many thousands of enthusiastlo Crusaders
went to their death in the Holy i Land.
For the' stirring and tragic tale. that :hÂ«
'â¢."has -.to", tell, ! Mr. Cram, could hot have
chosen a finer setting-.' He weaves his
' romance and history together, in splendid
style.
v. The story begins In France at the time
when "religious fervor was at its height
| and the flower of the kingdom was flock
/ ing to the standards of the knights of the
, cross. â â â ; Mlnette, the young daughter of
-the Count of Touralne, has been betrothed,
r by .the mutual agreement of the parents,
to Guibert de Barreaux. - It has been one
of those formal engagements customary
at that time, when tho wishes of the
principals were held entirely subservient
to the decision " of â  older heads.
- Guibert 'is selfishly anxious for the
match because he hopes through the
riches of Mlnette to retrieve his own lost
fortune. There is not the slightest spark
I of congeniality between the two and it
â¢ only needs the appearance of the dashing
and altogether admirable Lacey dÂ»
Hauteville;on the scene to save Mlnett*
from a loveless' weddings .With Mlnette
and Lacey it la a matter' of perfect af
fection and worship at. first sight.
Guibert is not willing to \ let his prizÂ»
slip so easily, however, and picks a quar*
rel with' the young knight, only to Jbi
himself defeated and to have the mortifi
cation of knowing that his life has been
spared by his more generous rival. For
'Lacey, after disarming Guibert, falls to
give the fatal thrust, and sheathes his
sword 'that it may be drawn again clean
for the Christian causo, and not red with
the blood of a countryman slain, on the
dueling field. :
This is the beginning of the feud be
tween Lacey and Guibert, a struggle th4t
Is carried from Franca to the', very walls
of Jerusalem Itself, and lasts until the
final climax and tragedy at the. end of tho
book. Guibert, smarting under his defeat,
both at arms and In the affair of hta
heart, vows to have the life of Lacey by
fair means or foul. The better to further
his base ends he joins the Crusaders and ,
acts as a spy for the Turks. ;
The scene then suddenly shifts to for
eign shoresâ b?itle, carnage and wild
alarms. Mlnette goes with her father to
Join the. Crusaders and In finally captured
by the Turku under the direction of Gui
bert. She is saved from him by the power
of Azzndin, a chief, who falls in love with
her. â  ':;â  : : - .-.,. â¢ â *.â ", ;' .;,--â '; '," \ : - '. â¢;. ; -, -
Mr. Cram paint* th.v glowing picture of
the Crusaders' trials and battles â¢ with
powerful strokes, but through it all brings
out the complicated intricacies of his ro
mance with vivid distinctness. It Is on!y
in the closing chapter ihat the last thread
is drawn and his story, made complete.
One other woman figures In -the bookâ
I .mils", a character almost as noble and
interesting as tl'at of Mlnette. Le Bon,
Tancrcd and L/Knfans also play most Im
portant parts and are splendid types of
the courngeou3 CrusaOers, who dared
their all for the pake of the cross. '."..*

Pub l*hÂ«r. 20 Post St peÂ»t. -'MME. SEMBRIEN AND HER DRESSDEN HOME
THEY were all goof fairies in at
tendance trben not so very many
year? ago a little girl named Mar
ceQa was' started on the journey of
life in the mi of "RTfasccwexyk.
Oalicla. No one haH been omitted in the
:nvitatior.Â«-- arnJ every fairy brought the
best gift at her command.
"She shall have a complexion of peaches
and cream," paid the first fairy, quite
after the maner of those of her race v.ho
Jive in story books. "She fhall have- beau
tiful jewels." said the second. "She shall
live in a. beautiful house like a palace,"
said the third, trying to outdo her sister
fairy. "She shall live there with Prince
Charming, the man whom she loves."
said the fourth. "She shall speak many
tongues," said the fifth. "Yes." sni<l the
sixth, "and shÂ«- shall travel in many lands
and the people shall love anrl admir<
hÂ«r." "But they mi^ht not." said the
seventh fairy, "If I do not give her the
power to play divinely upon the most
musical of instruments." "Oho." said the
eighth fairy, "what Is the voice of an
instrument? I will do better than that; I
will give her a voice of her own of crys
tallized sunbeams, and there is nothing
she can have better in all the wide world."
"Ye*," said the ninth, a serious fairy,
"that Is a. great gift, and she ha"f? been en
dowed with many good things, but I will
give her something without which she
would not be worthy of all those gift*.
without which she would not be able to
make the best use of them and become a.
great artist ar.d 'â¢*â  good woman. 1 will
give her the ability to work and without
this the cannot obtain any of the Rood
things that have been promised her."
And all the eight falrlf* were sorrowful,
but the ninth fairy wa* right, for there
was never a great artist or a. gn-a! woman
â who did not put forth every effort, in the
race lor life. That wan the ri-ason thai
Mttle Marcella Kokhansky, or Scmbrich,
*.* *h* cum to be known later, began to
study the piano when *hÂ«Â» was four, the
vioMn when she wax six; later spent much
lime in developing a. voice of "crystallized
hu;, beams," and now has all the good
gifts that the fairies promised to the lit
tle cirt in Wisnewszyk.
Perhaps Mmr. Sembrich would say that
she owes "her beautiful voice, or at leant
itu power*, to her good luck in being
Bdvtaed to go to Milan, where fine studied
the bel canto under the younger Um
perti. Certainly uhe hag great admiration
for and faith In the benefits of the old
Italian art of. Kinging, and uho may well
have, for a clever critic calls her "the
moit eminent living exponent of the 'bvl
canto.' " The flexibility of the voice* of
Botne of the older artists, the wide range
of their repertoires. Mme. Sembrich cred
its r... the bel <anto, and the inability of
th? younger singers to use their voices
after a few years of work she believes is
because; of the lack of exercise, the lack
of those vocal gymnastics which the Ital
ian opera gives. But she loves the Italian
oprra also for itself alone.
-.There; win be a reaction in favor of
Italian opera." Mme. Sembrich said the
other day. speaking in her pretty English,
which has a charming but indescribable
accent, an accent which muy bt remin
iscent of the- Polish, Russian. German.
French or Italian, or all of them. "When
the people hear it they like It." she went
on. "In Germany in the spring we had
a course of Italian opera; we had full
houses always and the people were do
!Igh!Â»d. Y
"Everything now Is Wagner and the de
'â¢lamatory style of music, and the young
*!n?cr.Â« must take up Wagner immediate
ly. What is the result? In a year or two
they have no volce3. It requires the Ital
ian opera, the. bel canto, to develop the
voice properly, td give It a wide range of
"As a musician I believe In Wagner as
the higher type of music, but then there
is the beautiful melody and air In the Ital
ian opera. Take Lehmann; remember how
long she has been singing- and see what
a wonderful voice she has. She sings
Wagner, but she also sings 'Norma.' She
hÂ«s haÂ«l the practice. In the Italian school.
Take then De Reszke. He sings Wagner,
but he sings as well Romeo. There are
other KinjrerH who may sing Wagner, but
who cannot King anything else. If they'
should give here the Italian opera with
many artlKts. not with one, as Mclba or
Kanv.-H or Lehmann. but a full cast, I am
sure the people would be pleased."
These thoughts come In the nine busy
months of the year when Mme. Sembrich
Jk simply Mme. Sembrich the artist, who
thinks and lives and alngÂ« only music.
She ha* beautiful apartments In a hotel,
rooms fragrant with the flowers sent by
her many admirers, arid with only pic
tures of her real home to remind her of
It, and some of the treasures from It, sou
venirs of her life as an artist, autographs
of the famous men and women she has
known. She keeps the greater number of
the latter at her home In Dresden, though
a few are always with her on her travels,
those in the big autograph album which
is not yet filled.
The world does not know so much ot
Mme. Sembrich at her home, for there
Â«he Is only the woman and the mother..
That Is what she says of herself. It is
an Immense house in a beautiful part of
THE SUNDAY CALL.
the cityâ ft mansion wmch a fairy god
n.othcr might well describe as a palace.
It has u. largo garden around It. where
the prima. lionna sits sometimes during
the three months when she rests entirely.
She studies the "greut nature," then vis
its the art museum of Dresden and hardly
thinks of music. â¢ - â  .
For six or, eight weeks she *oes not
sing a note. Her voice has an entire rest.
Then she begins to practice a littleâ for
an hour u day perhaps, but then only
for tlve minutes at n. time and no more.
For three months she Is a happy woman,
living as quietly as any woman in pri
vate life, and with only one wish ungratl
fied. â 'â â  â ' ' ' Y ; -â '-.â¢'". ' *
The illustrations show the exterior of
the house in Dresden and two rooms in
the interior, two special favorites of Mme.
Ccmbrlch, pictures which sho takes with
her when she is traveling. The larger
room is the drawing-room. At the right,
in the rear. Is the big cabinet of Meissen
porcelain, where is kept Mme. Sembrlch's
wonderful collection of autographs. The
smaller room is Mme. Sembrich'a own
private sitting-room, and on the wall
hangs a portrait of the singer by Len
bach, the great painter, whose portraits
of Bismarck and the* Emperor Wllhelm
der Grosse are so well known.
This autograph collection is wonderful;
it la really a collection of tributes to
Mme. Sembrich's genius and from artists
of all kinds.' There are some 500 auto
graphs altogether. One of these is that
of Wagner, with a screed from his pen
upon ' the bel canto, and another is that
of Beethoven. But those among the later
ones In the collection which Mme. Sem
brich has with her are from people of
such note that he is a happy mortal who
has an opportunity to' see them.' The In
terest in them is increased by the poems,
sketches, bars of music or paintings that
accompany them, each according to the
bent of its author's genius. -
The book opens with one Â« of the most'
effective of the contributions, a pen and
ink sketch of a mamcioth lion by Paul
Meyerhelm. a celebrated animal painter,
who has written beneath In German
words to 'the effect that this savage son
of the' wilderness now hears >"the sweet
tones of thy voice," which the artist who
created him has heard long since. The
autograph follows. â¢ .
.Brahms, the composer, wrote on a por
trait which hÂ© Bent "to the great art
ist." with his heartfelt admiration, and in
the book a few bars cf music. "To the
Incomparable artist from your affection
ate Hans von Bulow," wrote that great
musician, and Adclina' Patti has in
scribed in the album, :'To my dear friend
Marcella. Sembrich, with pleasant . re
membrances," while near is a bar of music
from Schumann, with the autograph of
Clara Schumann, who writes "to Fruu
Marcella Sembrich with wondering and
heartfelt remembrance of. her finished '
art.". â¢ â â >' v ..' " : : .Y,' . ;;l*. ,
.There are all nationalities and all lan
guages In the book, which is a handsome
volume, large. and square, and next comes
another pen and ink sketch from a Polish
artist, dedicated as It reads translated.
"To . my lovely Marcella," by Josef
Brandt.. It Is the head of a horse, ex
cellently done, ; and beside, the animal a
rough looking peasant m native costume.
The painter. Lenbach . has given a most

to which all Munich is devoted. Then
above appears â  the nn.iaa aiarcella Sem-
brich. Above tr.e iww appears tae Â«tra'Â»
rays, the voice of the prima donna, which
lifts the city from its grosser enjoyment
to higher thlngra. That Is something of
the parable the artist has roughly
sketched. It Is this same Lenbach.wLo

There Is a pen and Ink sketch of a
sculptured head by "Welanslcl. the Polish,
sculptor, who writes also several verses
besides his name. One of the treasures
of the collection is a bar of music, with
a few admiring words from Johann
Strauss to "Der TJnverghelchHchen gen
ialen Kunstlerin Fran Marcella Sembrich
In HochverefcrungA'on ihrem Bewunderer
Johann Strauss," in the delicate hand
writing of the composer.

appears in the album, his name written
on a card as it wa3 left at one time when #â¢
he called upon the prima donna, and Al
bert Benoes has put in the book a charm
ing water color painting. An interesting
page is that of the Russian painter, T.
Alwasawsky. He has had a large photo
graph of himself taken sitting in his
studio with his palette in his hand by the
side of a picture in a heavy frame. In
side the frame the photograph has been
cut away and the artist has painted in
colors a little marine view. Jan V. Chel
minskl has painted a full-page picture In
water colors of a Polish soldier on horse
back, and Bobroft has painted perhaps
the most beautiful contribution in the.
book and the most charming sentiment.
Just above the center of the page is the
face of a cherub, a child's head In water *
colors beautiful In drawing and exquisite
in delicate coloring. "* The artist's â¢ nama
is I below and in the corner the words,
"The angel is an echo of the voice of
Marcella Sembrich." That is an Ideal
compliment. . ,.

rerrd the room every child In the piece
fcobtcd up and yelled 'js'.Hy. "Gooo'-ina-Ti

%Â«fck- rrin spread over Â«vÂ«?ry face. That in
'itself was significant, tor the music teach
er is usual!" toi*rateaâ that is all.
Without the comma rid books went dowi
end backs â went up. Every one- sat tip fis
straight as a roldicr at "cttrntion." Sui
denly the children commenced to breaths
deeply: not in that shoulder-moving, pain
ful fashion, but a Â«-egular in-and-out.
Then, with r.o warning- whatever, nil com
menced to sing.
When I turned to Miss Carpenter In
wonderment I found mat she was busily
engaged. To all appearance It -was a
mysterious deaf ar.d dumb alphabet. She
raised one hand and then the other,
epread her arms far tpart, turned her
wrist In one direction and then Â£n another
end then clapped her palms softly to
gether. And all this time the children
were tinging a tune to the accompan
tsent of her bands.
She held her hand ose way for one 3'.
vieion of tbÂ« room, and the other sans an
entirely different strain.' After a few
notes the strain took cr. a familiar air,
and soon "Ar.nlc L,aurie" filled the rooir.
The funniest part of it all was that the
s Isgcrs were perfectly unconscious that
they were humming anything that they
had ever heard. They were simply fol
lowing Miss Carpenter'/ hands.
Tur.e after tune followed her hands,
and never once was It anything frivolous
or foolishly light. Mendelssohn's "Dulla
by" would have pleased even the most
fastidious. The babies were not over 8,
but no one could accuse* them of having
a "throaty" or a "nasal" tone,
Bfforc they began Miss Carpenter cau
tioned them not to sing too loudly. "Re
w!tii,'r. the baby wants to eo to sleep,
and if you make too niuch nolze he won't
dolt. Just whirper it" And they. did.
.All the while they were rocking an Imag
inary baby to sleep In their arms, and
mhr.n the last note died away every eye
was on the sleeping child.
Tl:at is the the supervisor teaches
muck:. She wants her pupils to feel first
of all. After that all comes easy, nhe
Â»aye: "It Is Impossible to crowd their
little heads, but when you appeal to thfctr
err?, they are remarkably quick to un
dcrftnr;d."
â¢ A teacltcr told me an amusing story. A
rirall boy bad been visiting: his grand
xneiher for some time. When he returned
r-e found a. baby sister installed in his
place. Just about that time the little
titles had taken it Into her head to scream
zt.A Dickie watched her with considerable
crxlety.
"Why, mother, At she keeps on hollerin*
like that, she'll burst her vocal chords,
end then nhe can't never sing. Let's stop
her Â»nd show her how to do it right," he
said.
"Yon see," said Miss Carpenter, "in lit
tle ways I find out that the idea Is
grasped. That email boy is no wiser than
the rest of his classmates, but he under
stood that something was radically
wrens/*
,-\n>" chick belcxv the fourth grade can
tell you all about "\-ocal chords." "tone?," 1
"pure," "nasal" and "feeling." A little Is
taught at a time, but the children are not
required to rrmember any cf it. After
several r-"pctfticns ihry scorn to know it.
In fart, they seem always to Sieve known
it.
And that Is the secret o[ the super
visor's soccers.
She tells in story fashion that which
appeals to them and rays nothing about
storing it away. ChUd-Uke they remem
ber the stcry and v.lth It the truths that
wore carefully interwoven.
The yystcm used is known as the "tonic
sol-fa." and It Is Its extreme simplicity
that rr.akep It so easily understood nnd
followed. It iÂ« built upon the idea that
good music has always an elevating in
fluence, and that all children, unless phy
sically imporfeot. can be taught to sin*;
sweetly instead of rattling off a tune any
old way.
The tones of the scale are mastered in
the very beginning. Not from a black
board, however, or even from printed pic
tures, but from the varying positions of
his teacher's hand connected with her
softly modulated voice. The tones are
pure and full long before the pictured clef
and staff could be comprehended. The
"hand Elgns" "or sign language" is used
with the best results even In the lowest
grades.
".Low do and "high do" are conquered
first, and then the other notes are Intro
duced day after day until they are all
very familiar. After a certain amount cf
practice the pupils understand the teach
er's movements so well that she is able
to play on them as she would on a key
board.
The most surprising part of it Is the
way they go unfaltering up and down the
scale. They secrn unconscious of every
thing but those hands, those ever rest-
Ices hands.
The "motion sonss" belong exclusively
to the little people. Firat Miss Carpenter
tells them the story and then she asks
them what motions they think would be
appropriate. After ' many suggestions
they finally agree. Sometimes they fall
to agree and then each one makes
the motions that seem to him â  to
Interpret the words best. When they sing
the "Red, White and niue" the arms fly
wildly through the air with so .much vigor
that foreign countries had better think
twlco about getting Into trouble with us
some twenty years hence.
One of the favorite songs is "Grandpa.
Come and Dance with Me." Up come the
tiny skirts and there are all kinds of
pirouetting and fancy steps. The hands
arc held out Invitingly to "Grandpa," and
there are many coaxing gestures to In
veigle one to Join the merry dance.
"Daisies fair are nursery maids with
frills upon their caps. The daisy budÂ«
are little babes they tend upon their
laps."
This seems to bring out more Individ
ual characteristics than,! anything else.
The fingers pantomimically show the be

ART NEWS OF THE WEEK
OJfE making a note of the private
galleries In America, regardless of
where they may be, either In New
York or San Francisco, will be
forced to repeat the much worn
a~d tiresome remark that home peopl*
a'Â« not appreciated, for the lack of local
representatives In private galleries Is
anaxlns. New Yorkers have aniong their
collections an occasional San Francisco
picture, which they show with the sanw
prlfie with which the European products
are brought forth. _
San Franciscans show the pictures of
clever New Yorkers, and place their work
e!3e by eld* of foreign masters,
but It will bÂ« found that la either of the
two places mentioned, and they represent
all the United States, the work of a local
artist Is generally pot In a corner and not
noticed at alL
Now, considering that Americans should
have our nation's characteristic trait of
Independence, why not be original, why
not branch out and love art for art's
sake? If an unknown man to an obscure
comer of the earth produces a master
piece, which Is sometimes the case, why Is
not that work of equal value, and more.
Â£sr be Is our countryman, than a foreign
painting of only the same merit? True It
Â«s that a catalogue with here and there
the name of Van Dyke, of Rembrandt, of
Velasquez or of Rubens Is a very satisfy
ing bit of paper to show one's friends, as
a representation of the art In one's col
li'-lon, but one must also consider that
these great masters were once students,
and that their earlier work, snatch draw-
Ings, study sketches and Indifferent bits,
the failures upon which they gradually
etepped to greatness, are not a whit bet
ter than some of our etudents can do.
U those masters were living they would
laugh to socm and decline to -show, ex
cept as a joke, some of their earlier ef
fort*, but all these, upon the death of the
raster, wr* gathered up from the dust
r^rcTed attics and studio corners, put on
the market by shrewd and world-wise
dealers, and uold for fabulous prices;
many of them coming to our country.
Buying a tignature is all right; only be
consistent and eay. "Here Is So-and-so's
signature"; but when one says, as I have
h'-ard It remarked, that It is Irreverent to
mention the meritorious work of an un-
Itnown artist, in comparison lo an in
different sketch from an old master,
which was only put on the market and
r--ld at nil when the man who painted It
was dead and could not help himself, is
nonsense. No artist ever turned out mas
terpieces from his Infancy. No human be-
Jng Is always at concert pitch, and, more

Now in San Krancicco the sent'*?, re
fining- influence of the softer sex Is ffit
at these celebrations. The toast list has
diminished to a few, but there arc three
toasts always honoredâ the loyal* to;\>t.
the patriotic toast and the toast of the
evening.
The loyal toast for half a century hns
been drunk to the Queon. This year it
whs drunk in sllpncr. white a prayer
ascended to the God of AH to protect
and guide him who has taken her place.
The patriotic toast is ofTored to out
President. This also was drunk In
silence, for both tho President and iliÂ«
Queen have "slipped awa* " since last St.
Andrew's day.
Then the toast of the evening. "The
l>ay and a* Wha Honor It." was drunk
with Highland honors, one foot on tho
table, the other on the chair.
A stalwart piper marching: up and down
the corridors playing the national a!rs
was the first thins that caught the car
and eye of the guest bound for tho ban
quet. The guest was marched in to the
reception committee and mri<3<Â» to feel at
home. These gatherings arc like large
family reunions.
At the time appointed, the company
formed in line and to the sound of th-Â»
bagpipes marched into the banquet room,
where, when all are seated, a hit*: â â¢sin,'; was
solemnly asked by the chaplain. The munu
always contains some characteristic Scotch
dishes, such as cock-a-Icckie. hotchpotch,
scones or oat cakes, and the ncillonnl
dish, the haggis. The hapsir. is bjrne on
the shoulders of a walfr preceded by a
piper playing "The Cock of the North."
It Is borne around the room and at last
placed before the president or host uf ih.Â»
evening:, who proceeds to "cut it up wi"
ready clelght." while Burns' "Address to
a Hassis" is rec'tod.
The haggis is ' tearfully and wonder
fully made." It Is a conglomeration of
heart, liver, kidneys and other internal
organs chopped with onions, parsley anil
oatmeal; the whole boded for hours in
the stcrr.arh of a shÂ°rp. T<) the true
Scotch palate the haggis Is delicious. -H<r
who asks for a secona helping is inarktil
as one who is the real thing.
San Francisco has a St. Andrews So
ciety of no mean proportion and preten
sion, whose motto is: "Our ain ills ay:
hae streneth to bear, anither's aye hae
heart to feel."
The St. Andrew's Society is one of the
richest benevolent fraternal societies on
the coast. It is an aristocrat In our cos-
as our country Is and as little as we are
supposed to know about rrt in comparison
with European countries and people, tno
truth, Furprislng as It may be, is that
many of the rare c!d paintings in Enp
land to-day were purchased In New York.
Sixty or more years ago there were In
New York men who appreciated and wero
true patron* of art, consequently for a
time America was the great market for
old paintings, which were sent here by
the balÂ« from all portions of Europe. It
Is stated that on*? auction-house alone In
New York durlni? forty years' time solil
over 1 .000,009 pictures.
English dealer* kept agents here to pur
chase desirable canvases as they appeared
In tlie sales. Consequently many of the
rpfi paintings in that land of the haw
thorn, also some that now hang In the
National Gallery, were bought in this way.
This also accounts for the occasional rara
old masterpiece that now and then crops
up In this country. For although many
of those large consignments were rub
bish, there were some few that If put on
ealo to-day would net thousands of dol
lars.
These cloudy, misty days are decidedly
bad for studio work, for the light Is poor,
but It is haying time for sketching gray
day effects. It is almost an everyday oc
currence to sic artists, like duck hunters,
favor tho marshes on rn.'ny days, for their
green beauty Is enhanced twofold with a
eoft atmosphere.
G. Cadenasso is particularly fond of this
weather, and he can often be seen sally
ing forth armed with immense sketching
umbrella and painting paraphernalia lo
ctudy his beloved eucalyptus. Perhap-i
this study from nature is the er-crct of tho
rapid strides this artist hae made.
0. P. Neilson. the water colorist, Is
making some studies ol San Francisco as
viewed from an elevation. He hus chosen
Telegruph Hill, and he says that the ef
fect Is enchanting and somewhat Vene
tlan-llke from that point of view. /
Maren Frollch has returned from the

There were theoric-s innumerable as to the

of sec-ring a fabulous ransom. Grenfall
Lorry tad an astonishing theory In his
mind, and the more he thought it over
the mere firmly It was Imbedded.
The warm, blue coils from the cigar

them a myriad of tangled thoughts â of

Felf. of everything. A light step on the

the balustrade, her hands clasping a
bouquet of red roses, her chin lifted, her
fyos gazing toward the mountain's cre?t.
the prettiest picture he had ever seen.
The strange dizziness of love overpower
ed him. His hungry eye? glanced upward
toward the sky which she was blessing
â with her gaze, and behelfi another picture,
gloomy, grim, cheerless.
Against the moonlit screen of the uni
verse clung the black tower of that far
away monastery in the clouds, the home
of the monks of St. Valentine. Out of the
world, above the world, a part of the sky
itself. It stood like the specter of a ?en
liriel whose ghostly guardianship ap
palled and yet soothed.
He could not, would not more. To have
done so meant the desecration of a pic
ture so delicate that a breath upon its
surface would have swept it forever from
the vision. How he reveled in the giory
of the picture he knew not, for it was as
if he looked from a dream. At last he

They fell t.o the gTound below. He thought

advanced to her ride, his bat in one hand,

"1 did not know you were here," she
exclaimed, la half frightened amazement
"I left my ladies Inside."
He was standing beside her, looking
down into the eyes.
"And I an richer because of your igno
rance," he said/softly. "I have seen a
picture that shall never leave my memory
â never! Its beauty enthralled, enrap
tured. Then I eaw the drama of the
roses. Ah. your highness, the crown is
not always a ma.sk."
"The roses wereâ wrore of no conse
quence," ehe faltered.
â¢'I have heard how you stand between
two suitors and that wretched treaty. My
heart has acbed to tell you how I pity
yon."* - : .
**It Is not pity I nc*d. but courage. Pity
will not aid me in my duty, Mr. Lorry. It
stands plainly before me, this duty, but
I have not the courage to take it up and
place it about my neck forever."
"You do not, cannot love this Lorenz?"
he asked. â¦
"Love him!" ehe cried. "Ach, I forget!
Tou do not know him. Yet I ehall doubt-
Ie*s be hla wife."* There was an eternity
of despair in that' low, steady voice.
'â¢you shaU not! I swear you ehall not!"
"Oh. he is a Prince,! I must accept tho
offer that means salvation to Graustark.
Why do you make it harder wjth torture
which .you" think is kindness? Listen to
me. Xext week I am to give my answer.
He will be here, in this castle. My father
brought this calamity upon Graustark; I
must lift it from the people. WhatÂ»has
my happiness to do with it?" - ;
Her sudden strength silenced him,
crushed him, with the real awakening of
helplessness. He stocd beside her, look
ing up at the cold monastery, strangely
conscious that the was gazing toward the
same "dizzy height. â¢
"It looks so peaceful up there," she said
nt last. â¢ . fei â 
"But so cold and cluerless, he added,
drearily. There was another long silence
in which two hearts communed through
the medium of that taraway sentinel.
"They have not discovered a clew to the
chief* abductor, have they?" he asked, in
an effort to return to his proper sphere.
"Baron Dangloss believes he has a clew
â a meaner and unsatisfactory one. he ad
mitsâami to-day sent officers to Ganlook
to investigate tho actions of a strange
man who was there last week, a man
who styled himself the Count of Araba

is possible he is one of them." She spoke

"Your Highness, I have a .theoryâ a

man may go to cbtain his heart's desire?
She looked at him instantly, her eyes
wide with growing comprehension, tho
Volution to the mystery darting into her
mind like a flash.
"You ::uanâ " she began, stopping as
if afraid to voice the suspicion.
"That Prince Gabriel Is the man woh

"Uut he could never have forced me to

"You do not apprec.atc my estimate of

"Ur.at is to become of me?" she al

now â I see plainly! It was Gabriel,
and he would have done as you pay." A
shudder ran through her ligure and he
tenderly whispered in her ear:
"The danRer is pasi. He can do no
more, your Hishness. Were I positive
that he is the man â and 1 believe he is â
I would hunt him down this night."
Her eyes closed happily under his gaze,

and a sweet sense of security filled her

"I am not afraid." she murmured.
"Because I am l:ero?" he asked, bend

looking "into his eyes with a love at last

"Am I not a feeble mite to sit on that

throne at the opposite end of the hall.
"From Us seat I calmly instruct gray
hairtd statesmen, weigh their wisdom and
pass upon it as if I were Demosthenes,
challenge the e\-ils that may drive mon
arch* mad, and wonder If my crown is on

Is sacrt-d, thou thoughtless American.
Come, we will draw nearer that you may
see the beauty of the workmanship lit
that great old chair."
They stood at the base of the low vel
veted stage on which stood the chair,
with its high back. Its massive arms and
legs ashimmer in the lifht from the lofty
windows. It was of gild, inlaid with pre-
Hous stones â diamonds, rubles, emeralds,
sapphires and other wondrous jewelsâ a
relic of ancient GrauRtark.
"I never sit in the center. 'Alwavg at
one side or the other, usually leaning my
elbow on the arm. You see, the discus
sions are generally so long and dreary
that I become fatigued. One timeâ I am
ashamed to confess itâ I went to sleep on
the throne. That was long ago. I man
age to keep awake very well of late. Do
you like my throneroom?" -.-
"And to think that It Is yours!"
"It Is this room that gives me the right
to be hailed with *LÂ«ong live thÂ© Prlncessf
Not with campaign yells and 'Hurrah for
Yetive!' How does that sound? 'Hurrah
for Yetive!' " She was laughing merrily.
"Don't say It! It sounds sacrilegious
revolting!"
"For over three yearsâ since I was 18â1
have been supreme in that chair. During
the years of my reign prior to that time
I sat there with my Uncle Caspar stand

to sit down with me! Thero wan so much

ing, through ray sobs of mortification,
that I would have him beheaded. You are

created consternation or mirth." v -â :- ,
"What a whimsical little princess you
must have been, weeping nnÂ«l pouting and
going to sleep." he laughed. "And how
sedate and wise you have become."
"Thank you. How very nice you are.

said that of sovereigns as far back an

really like to see me In that old chair?"
Bhe asked.
"Ah. you arc still a woman," he Â«ald,
smiling at her. pretty vanity. "Nothing
could Impress me more ->leaBantly."
She stepped carelessly and impulsively
upon the royal platform, leaned against
the atm of the throne, end with the
charming blush of consciousness turned
to him with the quickness of. a- guilty
confidence, eager to hear his praise, but
fearful lest he secretly condemned her
conceit. His eyes were burning with the
admiration that knows no definlnc. and
his breath came quick and sharp through
parted lips. He Involuntarily placed a
foot upon the bottom step as if to spring
to her side. :
"You must not come up here!" she
cried, shrinking back, her hands extended
in fluttering remonstrance. "I cannot
permit that at all!" ~-. -^
"I beg your pardon." he cried. "That
is all the humble plebeian can say. That
I may be more completely under this
fairy spell,-'pray'.cast about yourself the
robe of rank.and take up tho scepter.
Perhaps I may fall upon my face."
"And hurt your head all over again."
she said, laughing nervously. She lies!-
tatcd for a moment, a perplexed frown
crossing her brow. Then she jerked a
rich robe from the back of the throne and
placed-it about her shoulders as only a
woman can. Taking up the scepter she
stood before the great chair, and, with a
smile on her lips, held it above his head,
saying softly: , ,
"Graustark welcomes the American
Prince"
He sank to his knee before the real
Princess, kissed the hem of her robe and
arose with face pallid. The chasm was
now endless in its immensity. The Prln-
cess gingerly seated herself on the throne,
placed her elbow on the broad arm. her
white chin in her hand, and tranquilly
surveved the voiceless American Prince,

stood erect, as if to forsake the .throne

With an exclamation of delight, he re-

trembled as he took up hers to carry it
to his lips. "We are childrenâplaying

She allowed her hand to lie limply in

chRir. When her hand was near his fev-

that they had trespassed long enough,, on

piece of nobility promptly followed the
Prime Minister's example and escorted
the remaining guest to the gate. .

t -.V P-ryjS XVâ THE BETROTHAL : K -^
Harry Anguish was a discreet, forbear
ing fellow. He did not demand a full ex
planation of his friend. There was enough
natural wit in his merry head to, see that
in connection with their departure there
â waa something that would not admit or
discussion, even . by confidential : friends.
He shrewdly formed his own conclusions
and held his peace. Nor did he betray
surprise when Lorry Informed him, in an-
Bwer to a question, that he Intended to
retrain In Edelweiss for some time, add
ing that he could not expect him to do
likewise if he preferred to return to Paris.
But Mr. Anguish preferred to remain in;
Edelweiss. Had* not the Countess Dag
mar told him she would always be happy
to see him at the castle, and had he any:
xeason to renounce Its walls? And so it
was that they tarried together. : â¢ : -
Lorry loitered aimlessly, moodily about
the town, spending gloomy days and
wretched nights. He reasoned that It
were wisdom to fly, but a force stronger
than reason held him In Edelweiss. He
ventured several times to the castle wall,
but turned back resolutely. There was
hope in his breast that she might send fur
him; there was, at least, the possibility
of seeing her should she ride through. the
streets. Anguish, on the other hand, vis
ited the castle dally. He spent hours with
the pretty Countess, undismayed by the.
noble moths that fluttered about "her
Hame, and he was ever persistent, light
hearted and gay. He brought to Lorry's
cars all that he could learn of the Prin
ctss. Several times he had seen her and
l:ao. spoken with her. She inquired casu
ally after the health of his friend, but
nothing more. From the Countess he as
. certained that her Majesty was sleeping
soundly, eating heartily and apparently
enjoying the best of spiritsâ Information

..They had been at the hotel for over 'a,

into the room, out of breath and scarcely
able to control his excitement. , >
"What's up?" cried Lorry. "Has tho
Countess sacked you?" : . â  â¢ .
"Not on your coin! But something is up,
and 1 am its discoverer. You remember
what you said about suspecting Prinve
Gab'riel of being the chief rascal In the
abduction job? Well, my boy. I am now
willing to stake my life that he is the

"Oh. I forgot to tell you. Prince Lor

Lorry had turned pale and was reaching
for the wall with unsteady hand.

slowly, painfully. . V : / W .../ Â»
â¢That's right! I hadn't thought of

Near the door leading to the piazza
Etood several men, gray and blue. Tho
man designated as Gabriel was in the
center, talking gayly and somewhat loud
ly puffing at a cigarette between Â«Â»en
tences. He was not tall, but_he was
strongly and compactly built. His hair
and cropped beard were as black as coal,
his eyes wide, black and lined. It was a
pleasure-worn face, and Lorry shuddered
as he thought of the Princess in the
power of this evil-look:ng wretch. They
leisurely made their way to a spot near
the talkers. There is no mistaking the,
voice. Prince Gabriel and Michael were
on- and the same, beyond all doubt. But
how to prove It to the satisfaction of
others? ; -; . â  'â¢â  : .'- i â  â â  ' â â  * â â 'â¢"-â â 
V Skepticism would follow any attempt to
proclaim the Prince guilty because his
voice sounded like that of the chief con-
Fplrator. In a matter where whole na
tions were concerned the gravest Im
portance would be attached to the accu
sation of a ruler. Satisfying themselves
as to the Identity of that peculiar voice,
tho friends passed througn to the piazza.
"What's to be done?" asked Anguish,
boiling over with excitement.
"We must go to Baron Dangloss, tell
hfrn of our positive discovery, and then
consult Count Halfont."
"And the Princess Yetive, of course.'
"Yes, I suppose so," said Lorry, nicking
the ashes from his cigar with a finger
that was now steady. He was serving the
Princess again. . .
They hurried to the Tower, and were
soon "in the presence of the fierce little
chief of police. Lorry had spent many
hours with Dangloss of late, and they had
become friends. His grim old face blanch
ed perceptibly as he heard the assertions
of the young men. He shook his head
despairingly. ', >
"It may be as you say, gentlemen, but
I am afraid we can do nothing. To charge
a Prince with such a crime and on such
evidence would be madness. I am o*. your
belief, however. Prince Gabriel Is the
man I have suspected. Now I am con
vinced. Before we can do anything in
such a grave matter It will be necessary
to consult the Princess and her Ministers.
In case we conclude to accuse the Prince
of Dawsbergen, it must be after careful
and judicious thought. There are many
things to consider, gentlemen. -â¢ For mjr
part, I. would be overjoyed to seize the
villain and to serve him . as â  we did his
tools, but my hands are tied, you see. I
would suggest that you go at once to the
Princess and Count Halfont, tell them of
your suspicionsâ â" v , â¢ .
. "Not suspicions, my lordâ facts," inter
rupted Anguish. .- : .
â â¢â¢ ''Well, then, facts, and ascertain how
they feel about taking up a proposition
.that may mean war. May I ask you to
'come at once to me with their answer?
It Is possible that they will can for a
consultation with the Ministers, nobles
and high officers. â¢ Still, 1 I fear they will
be unwilling to risk much on the rather
flimsy proof you can give. Gabriel- is
powerful and we do not seek a war with
him. There is another foe for whom we
are quietly whetting our swords." The
significant remark caused both listeners
to prick up their ears. But he disap
pointed their curiosity, and they were
left to speculate -as to who the other foe
might be. Did he mean that Graustark
was secretly, slyly making; ready to resist,
treaty or no treaty?. : >.'
It required prolonged urging on the part
of Anguish to persuade Lorry to accom
pany him to the castle, but, when ' once
determined to go before the Princess with
their tale, he was eager, impatient to
cross the distance that-lay between the
hotel and the forbidden * grounds) They
walked rapidly down Castle avenue and
'were soon at the gates. The guard knew
them, and they were admitted .without *â¢
vrord.v As they hurried through the park
they saw many strange men In gray,
gaudy uniforms, and It occurred to Lorry
that their visit, no matter how great Its
importance, was ill-timed. Prince Lorenz
was holding the center of the stage.
Anguish, with his customary Impulsive
ness, overruled Lorry's objections, and
they proceeded toward the entrance. Tho
guards of the Princess saluted profound
ly, while the minions of Lorenz stared
with ill-bred wonder upon these two tail
men from another world. It could be seen
that the castle was astir with excitement,
subdued and pregnant with thriving hope-*
and fears. The nobility of Graustark was
there; the visitors of Axphaln were being
entertained.
At the castle doors the two met their
Arst obstacle, but they had anticipated its
presence. Two guards halted them per
emptorily.
"We must see her Majesty." said An
guish, but the men could not understand
him. They stoically stood tfceir ground,
shaking their heads. v
"Let us find some one who can un^f ;â¢
stand us," advised Lorry, and In a few
momenta tliÂ«?y presented themselves ibe
fore the guards, accompanied by a yountf
nobleman with whom they had acquaint
ance. He succeeded in advancing then
to the reception hall Inside the doors and
found for them a servant who would car
ry a message to the Princess If it wera
possible to gain her presence. The noble
man doubted very much, however, if tha
missive hastily written by Lorry could
find its way to her, as she had never been
so occupied as now. >-; -\. ; , â 
Lorry, In his brief note, prayed for a
short audience for himself and Mr. An
guish, requesting that Count Halfont be
present. He informed her that his mis
sion was of the most Imperative natura
and that it related to a discovery mado
concerning the Prince who had tried
to abduct her. In conclusion, he wrote
that Baron Dangloss had required him to
lay certain facts before her and that B-Â»
had come with no Intention to annoy her.
While they sat In the waiting room
they saw, through the glass doors, dozens
of richly attired men and women in the
hall beyond. They were conversing ani
matedly, Graustaric men and women with
dejected faces, Axphalnians with exulta
tion glowing in every glance. Lorry's
heart sank within him. It seemed hours
before the servant returned to bid them
follow him. Then bis blood leaped madly
through veins that had been chilled and
lifeless. He was to see her again!
~~Their guide conducted them to a small

"What!" he cried, jealousy darting;
into his existence. ' He had never known
jealousy before. *^"
"They are betrothed." said s&Â». with art

by Lorry's deep groan as he turned and
walked blindly to the opposite side of the
room. He stopped In front of a huga

see a line or a tint. . ; .

O!Â«!-UmerÂ» among the theatrical people

to remember exactly where, she. called
bereelf lltlrn Josephine Mansfield, though
her real name waÂ» Bald to be Warren,
â¢rid eh*! was sometimes referred to as the
"Y^rren girl." On the site where the

there was la thoÂ«* daye an Lr-shaped alley.

could not act. and was a!Â«o very ignorant.
Her beauty brought her livrr.-Â», but her

in that city. She could not act. but she

door through each back yard fence In
tervening 'â¢;.'.. between â ; .-; fhe office and . the
house of the woman who cost him. his
life. He passed much ' of : his time -in

the clerks in the office often watched him
go through the little green turfed yards
to meet the beautiful woman who some
times came out to greet him,
â  Later, among ; Fisk'* friends who en-
Joyed the ; frequent revels In the Twenty
â  third street, house was Edward S. Stokes,
a young man of good birth, whose father
: was In -the plate glass business.
.Stokes was a clerk in Wall street when
Fisk took, a fancy to him and made him
his protege, and also won for the young
man the friendship of Jay Gould. The
handsome figure and features of Stokes
gave him an advantage over Fisk, who
was short and so stout as to make it a
detriment to his appearance. He was
pompous, and ateo intensely vain. This
may have been a factor In the spell
which "Josle" Mansfield cast over Stokes,
who came more and more frequently to
the Kisk mansion. He loved the woman

for which his friend and partner had
paid." /. â ~^ ' â¢" - .â¢ '-â â¢â¢V v. 'I .

cared for his wealth. She boasted of her
love for Stokes. Fisk was wildly Jealous
and at once laid plans to ruin Stokes. The
latter was arrested one Saturday night for
embezzling funds of the oil company in
which he and Fisk had become Interested,
furnishing all the oil used by the Erie com
pany. Stokes wns in jail a couple of days,
and then had Fisk arrested for conspiracy
and ;V; false Imprisonment.;' Fisk . forced
down; the^atock' of the oil -company 'and
nearly ruined Stokes. Joslo Mansfield at
once took the part of , Stqkies "< and gave
him letters she ; had received . from : Fisk,
exposing the secrets of Tammany and the
Erie ,ring. Fisk paid $10,000 to get them
back and then sued : Stokes and Mansfield
ror blackmail, seeking* the menctment ox
both for that offense. .This news came to
Stokes, lolling amid the luxury of the
Mansfield home. - It was probably then
that the devil entered him to kill Fisk.
and it has been alleged that Josie Mans
field incited the deed. All of New York
was interested and agitated over the dif
ferences between the two; men. but none
surmised that It would end in red-handed
murder. The whole world was for a time
familiar 'with the details of the tragedy
that - followed. - ' * " X- '^. :â  : ::- , ' -
â : Stokes left the Mansfield place on the
afternoon of January C, 1872, went in a
hack to the Grand Central Hotel and sta
tioned himself in the corridor of the par
lor floor. The main staircase was in front
ot him. Hesbot Fisk twice as he was
coming up that staircase from Broadway.
Stokes was arrested before be could leave
'the hotel. Jay Gould i and -William Sf.
Tweed came to the bedside of Fisk, who
died the next day. His wife and brothera
were with him to the end. v "Josie" Mans
Â«eld was not there. v\:- ; ' ;':'Â©S^'^V^
Colonel "Jim" Fisk was burled with all
the honors that New York could bestow.
Stokes, after three trials, was convicted of
manslaughter in the third; degree. After
serving four years in prison he waa par-,
doned in 1877 by Grover Cleveland, - who
was then- Governor of New York.
Since his crime there has been no peace
for him and his face has told the story
of his misery. He has been guarded by
detectives and lived the life of a pariah
ever since on the remains of his fortune
until death claimed him at the home of
his sister. â¢
After the murder of Fisk the relations
between Stokes and the Mansfield woman
ceased. He is not known to have bad any
interest .again In any living woman, and
the beautiful woman, Rosamond Langdon
Barclay, who made claim while he waa
111 to being his wiT;, was not recognized
or acknowledged in his wilL
While Stokes was lying in prison, a play
was produced at Niblo's Gardens called
"Black Friday," in memory of the great
gold panic engineered by Fisk, and having
for its theme the killing of Fisk. Tha
scene of the murder wot laid in Wall
street, with Fisk shot as he passed the
office of Stokes. Charles Thorns took tha
part of Stokes, W. Price portrayed Fisk,
and Lizzie Fechter waa the notorious
beauty, Mansfield. The play was soon

After the wig has been taken off and

to discover that her eyes have been too

The recent successful opening of a
beautiful new children's theater In Boston
marks another era In the evolution of the
popular idea that a playhouse set apart
for, and given over entirely to, produc
tions for little folks, Is a necessity that
is bo'und to be recognized.
â  Plays for children are not a new thing.
Many have been written by French dra
matists and produced In 'Paris.
In London for years the children have
practically monopolized .the theaters at
the holiday. season, when an annual del
uge of Christmas pantomimes occurs and
spectncular plays of "Little Red Riding
Hood," "Tho Babes In ; . the Woods,"
"Punch and Judy," "Jack and the Bean
stalk," and other popular nursery tales,'

festival.:. â¢â . . â  -,â :.'â â ' â â : â  ' â â  â¢ - ," :-. â¢ .
But the Idea- of a permanent children's
theater Is wholly* new. The movement
began In New York and was formally In
augurated by Franklin Sargent,, of the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts, on
April 16, 1900, when 'a production. of "Jack
the Giant Killer" was given at Carnegie
Lyceum. This wan sufflcletly well - re
ceived to warrant the establishment last
season of a regular series of perform
ances, opening in December and extend
ing without Interruption through the win
ter. â  The first, play offered was the '.'For
est Ring," a charming fairy â¢ tale', fol
lowed by /'The Clown and the Locket."
Both these plays differed from those
heretofore nut forward ror the entertain
ment of children in that, Instead of being
merely spectacular affairs performed by
amateurs for tho most part, they were
real plays. with a regular. story and plot
running through the entire performance.
Charles Barnard, who Is a keen student
of. child . nature and was one of the
authors of the ."Forest Hlng," says ' of
these- performances: "The audiences
were, according to adult ideas,, vastly Im
polite. Applause I was Infrequent.. . The
children pat completely absorbed in â  the
performance, grasping quickly every sit
uation and occasionally remarking to
their . neighbors upon . the play and its
characters. They displayed fine dramatto
sense; every. person,- on the stage was
judged, not by his manner of impersonat
ing a character, but by the character it
self. Children are excellent critics of the
piny aÂ«> story. They care very little lor
the art of the performer." < c
â¢ Mr. Barnard is now engaged on a new
children's play. A Christmas pantomime
of unique character by Oliver Herford is
to be produced In New York during the
holidays and a children's opera will be
given during the season, and fancy the
-wild applause that, at no distant day,
will ring through the auditorium of thi\t
children's tV-eater In Boston when Meg and
Jo ariAmj step from the pages of "Lit
tle Women," and move through the
scenes of that charming children's classic.
What unbounded delight will such a dra
matization afford tho thousands of chil
dren who have read and reread the book
till its characters are alive to them.
'. What more adequate way of teaching
history than byjdramatlzlnjr Its dry pages
and presenting It to the children In the
form of a play? In this way, the world
of make-believe, dear to the childish
heart, will be turned to good account and
made the vehicle of truth taught in such
,r pleasing and, Impressive way that its
Imprint will never fade from the'memory.

You might not have thought

to saj- the least. It is a breach of eti
quette. It should certainly be Included
in all nolite volumes of "Don't."
But there are those who make excep
tions, those who say "on the other hand."
They say that.flaere are occasions upon
crhicn one should waive all polite scru
ples of this kind.. A whole jury of twelve
San Francisco citizens has lately sur
prised the community by saylnsr this
very- thing-. That Jury acquitted Patrick
Clancy of the charge of murder far kill
ing J. N. E. Wilson.
There was no question a? to who did
the killing. By every circumstantial evi
dence Clancy did it. By the dying words
of the murdered man he did it. By his
own Immediate and repeated confession
he did it. Clancy killed Wilson.
Why was he let po?
Because that jury of twelve San Fran
cisco citizens deemed that killing, In his
case, was Justifiable.
You remember what his case was. don't
you?â a simple matter of a pistol. HÂ»
had left his property interests in Wll-
Eon"$ charge, Wilson being a lawyer: WI1-
Eon had abused that charge, according to
the defense, and trouble between tkexn
ensued.
The lawyer told the story before he
died, caying that Clancy had come into
his office and Ehot him down after a short
conversation. He rave It to be under
stood that Clancy had come to the ofllce
with the Intent of committing what he
' called a "cold-blooded assassination."
Clancy, testifying In his own behalf,
told a story of golnr to Wilson's office
to attend to business. Then, said he, they
Quarreled. He alleged that Wilson
threatened to throw him out of bis office
and Â»eiz<-d a chair with which to strike
him. Being afraid of his life he shot
"Wilson. " l?/iÂ£J.-rX:' : ;i V ,
This is the gist of the story of what
has been determined a Justifiable killing.
The acquittal was popularly accounted
for by the fact that the murdered man
hod a bad reputation, so evidently Clan
cy's story was preferred to his.
He was acquitted on the* ground that
he killed In self-defense, and In
the eye of the law that Is not murder.
But keener even than the eye of the law
la the eye of the conscience. It Is the
moral side of the question that is here
discussed; this is what eeveral San Fran
ciscans from several points of view have
to eay on the subject:

HOW A DASHING VENEZUELAN GENERAL
TRIED TO RAISE MONEY FOR HIS TROOPS
ONE t of thÂ« most picturesque figures
in the Colomblan-Venesuelan war
was General Echeverria, the gal-,
lant Venezuelan who fell in battlr. In the
recent rout in Goajira.
He figured in the affairs of General
Mcnd&za, the dictator, in 1892. The Ven
ezuelan soldiers who had fought his bat
tles aealnwt Crespo for him refused . to
take empty promises for pay. They fol
lowed him around the streets of the cap
ital demanding their pay. Once in a while
he managed to get bold of some money,
which he always divided on the spot,
though it seldom appeased the hunger of
the troops for more than a day at a time.
In sheer desperation he called his friend
Echeverria to his assistance. He told him
to kÂ« and get money anywhere, anyhow.
HÂ«> might even take the troops. along to
assist in any little enterprise he might
think ofâ In fact, he would be delighted
t'> have them go with Echeverria. They,
went, for ISchevcrrla had a scheme ready
to hand.
The story of what next happened is In
tensely interesting to Americans, for an
American Consul figured prominently In it.
In the seaport of La Guayra. the com
mercial metropolis of the country, a num
ber of wealthy merchants were doing
buslr.cfts without Interruption from, tho

There are times when a terrible crime Is

PANIC, WITH LOSS OF LIFE, FOLLOWS COLLISION.
SOMEWHERE between the last Jutting pier of ;t he water fiyant and Alcatraz Island the Sausalito rode down the San Rafael early last night, crashing into her starboard side. On the
San Rafael was a crowd even larger than the ordinary Saturday night traffic affords. S he was slowly steaming toward ''SaiiJRafael when but of tlie thick fog r the Sausalito crashed
into her starboard side. Men, women and children, terror-stricken, rushed for life preservers and in dire confusion sought every means of escape from drowning. The San Rafael

How many were lost has onJy been roiighly estimated, fcr the work of rescue went on rapidly and confusedly. The /'accident was due to the impenetrability of the fog that settled
on the bay during the afternoon and clung to the surface of the water all night; Both boats played their hoarse fog whistles incessantly. ,
As the great gap filled up with water panic seized the passengers, two boats remained that many Jum^
trusting to the life preservers. Others found salvation on the small lifeboat or a plank. The scene of confusion and terror is told be^pwby^ ;
All those who came back on .the Sausalito did not bear Avhbie skins. Some were wounded, others had legs broken in the struggle for Iself preservation. 'In several of the hospitals
are men who were saved, but who are more or less seriously iniured. , . .. ' " : â¢* . ' .

THE OLD WAY
Oi Treating Stomach Trouble and
Indigestion, a Barbarous and
Useless One.
W> ray the old rray. but really it I* the
common and usual one at the present
time, ar.d many dyspeptics, and physi-
cians as well, consider the tlrst step In
attempting to cure Indigestion Is to diet,
either by selecting certain food and re-
jecting others or to sroatly diminish the
quantity of food usually taken. :
In other words, the starvation plan is
by many soppaeed to be the first essential
In the cure of weak digestion.
The almost ctrtaln failure of the star-
vation cure for stomach trouble has been
proven time and ajraln. but still the usual
advice, when dyspepsia makes Its appear-
ance. I* a course of dieting.
All this Is radically wrong. It Is fool-
ish and unscientific to recommend dl*t-
ing or starvation to a n*rÂ»on suffering
from dyspepsia, because indigestion itself
starves every organ and every nerve and
fiber in the body.
What is needed is abundant nutrition,
not less, and this means plenty of good,
wholesome, well cooked food and some
natural digestive to assist the weak
Ftomach to digest it.
This Is exactly the purpose for which
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet? are adapted,
and this is the may they cure the worst
cases cf stomach trouble.
The patient eats plenty of wholesome
food, end Stuart'* Dyspepsia Tablets di-
gests it for him. .
Ar.d this is in accordance with nature
and common sense because in thl* . way
the mbole system Is nourished and the
overm-orked stomach rested, because the 4
tablets will digest the food, whether the
f tomach works or not. One of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will digest 1SD0 grains
of meat, egc* and similar food. .
Any druggist will tell j-ou that Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is a remedy of ex-
traordinary value and probably is the
purest and safest remedy .for stomach
troubles.
So person suffering from poor digestion
and lack cf appetite can fail to be im-
mediately and permanently benefited lf
they "would make it a practice to take
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each meal.

Lawmakers in Reichstag
Discuss Insterbufg
Affair.
Editor Sharply Attacks Amer

Isthmus.
BBRLIN.VNOV.; '30.â Th*;; session of the
Reichstag so far has besn uninteresting.
With the exception of the dueling Inter
pellation the house has been occupied with
discussing the law providing for reform
In the relations between sailors and their
captains, Introducing more modern;con
ceptions Of the rights of labor.; The bill,
however, falls to Interest the, members
and the; debates: â¢have: taken place i to
empty benches. The Reichstag will begin
the tariff debate December 2. , V'V-
The dueling debate â¢â 'attracted the closest
attention of the country owing to Uhe
sensational character of the Insterburg
affair and showed that the antl-duellng
sentiment Is strongly- growing In the
Reichstag. There y?as much i display of
indignation among some legislators. Even
the Conservatives omitted their usual plea
for military duels. Some quarters 'ex
press the ; view that dueling is now so
fully condemned by other countries". that

people, however, assert that the speech
of the Minister of War, General yon Goss

William's energetic action in removing the
regiment's colonel : meets ::â  with v great
praise. The papers point out that? his
Majesty's decree of 1S97 does not go far
enough to prevent dueling and that It Is
still possible for officers to compel duels
under It. '
Objections to Uncle Sam.
American questions attracted the usual
amount of attention this week. .While the
action of the United States on the isthmus
of Panama Is admitted .by falrminded pa
pers to be In accordance ; with treaty
rights, the Cologne Volks Zeltung makes
It the~ subject of a: sharp attack. -It as
serts that the lesson learnable by.. the
isthmian occurrences Is that ; the .North
Americans,, in spite of the sovereignty of
other countries and In spite of solemn
treaties, will act In each cas? as it suits
their selfish desire. The paper â¢.'; sharply
criticized the United States for. preventing
Colombia from landing troops fat Colon
ar.d says that therefore the friendly rela
tions between the Ignited States and Co
lombia is the friendship of the cat and
mouse.' : 'â  .'{â -â  : '.- ; ..:>â  :->. ; :- ; v-:: ; -V,-:--": ; 'V^"::;>-:'- : . : ::.\-
The Cologne Volks Zeltung finally ad
mits the United States' rights, under the
treaty, to protect Isthmian traffic, .''but
only if Colombia expressly asks for such
protection, which she has not done," and
the paper calls the present action "usurp-'
atory." The paper also takes offense at
Secretary Hay. ! s,rccept speech, character
izing as "braggadocio" his. references. to
the United States' ."unlimited power and
gigantic military deeds."- - : r :'.: â . ; .., >V."
The tariff discussion also continues to
be, directed at the United States. At a
meeting of the manufacturers of the Co
logne district the secretary, Herr 8teller,
referred to the threatening American
competition, adding that It was necessary
that the tarlCF policy of Germany should
take into consideration ""this overpower
ing competition." He asserted that the
United States docs not want commer
cial treaties, since those that had been
drawn up remained unconfirmed by the
Senate, and maintained thar even the
new German tariff contains no duties ap
proaching the United States duties. The
Secretary also said:
Wants a Treaty Broken.
"We must adopt special measures
against the United States and must dis
regard the question of the renewal of the
commercial treaties with 'other.- countries.
We must adopt a tariff policy similar to
that of the United States and must also
denounce the present treaty with tho
United States." -V. : â :':-:;.':' â â ;'â â â ;[ 'â â â 'â ;.';: ':â >-â â 
Secretary Steller added that the United
Etatcs occupies an unfavorable position
In the tariff question. She has tariff con
troversies with various 'Countries and
would avoid a tariff war with Germany
if the latter gives similar tariff treatment
In retaliation. ; 'f r-: " v 1
The antl-Chamberlaln excitement Is

Employment in Penn-

v PITTSBURQ, Pa.,; Nor. 30.â There wsi
little change in the swlccnmen's strike to
day. Trains. are moving promptly and
there is no blockade on the Baltimore and
Ohio, Pennsylvania or Plttstrurg and Leke
Erie /roads. r ' :^~'-: > ...:.N:\- â 
Among the striking switchmen on the
Allegheny Valley road there was a rumor
current to-day that . the company was
willing to compromise on an additional
cent per hour and that negotiations would
likely be begun with this object In view.
The rumor, however, could not be verified.
All the mills between Eleventh and Fifty
fourth streets are shut- down on account
of their inability to obtain the ttecessary
fuel. It la estimated that about 6000 men
have been thrown idle. â¢
Railroad officials of all roads affected by
the strike, except the Allegheny Valley,
report to-night i that the * strike is over.
The Valley officials say the' worst Is over,
and that by Monday or Tuesday their
road will be In normal condition.
While the strike is practically disposed
of the companies find themselves -con
fronted with the > worst condition of
freight handling In the history of the
city. Mills along the Monongahela River
are working night and day at an unusu
ally high pressure and connecting roads
find It impossible to supply cars to the
big plants fast enough to get the manu
factured product away. It is said that In
the yards of the Homestead mill 28,000
tons of plates are stored with little room
left. If relief does not come soon it is
feared the works will have to shut down.
The ten-inch mills suspended to-day
and the twenty-elght-lnch mill Is likely
to follow soon. The car railway furnaces
at Braddock .will have to go. out for a
time It is feared, and the Edgar Thomp
son Steel Works are badly handicapped.
Manufacturers and merchants throughout
this entire district are being made to suf
fer severely by the lack of means for
transportation. /> ?;>.<*:: >â â¢,â â â ' .â¢:â¢â  â " V; : 'â â â â  . /â â ;..:

bad they been well advised.
Ismar. the famous Egyptian seeress. has
advised thousands during this year. Calm-
ly and in a business-like manner she has
confounded the critics and satisfied the
skeptics, and has endeared herself to all
who know her by simply "being" what
Fhe represents herself to be. One has only
to see and converse with this famous
Egyptian to feel that mesmeric force,
that unexplainable "something" in her
nature that makes her different from
other human beingsâ a power of good to
these who are wise enoueh to consult
htr.
The evidence of those who for years
have consulted this wonderful seeress is
of such a nature as to convince the most
skeptical of her power to forecast the
future accurately, and not one among the
thousands who have come to her for ad-
**:ce have been dissatisfied with results,

Special Dispatch to The Call
GOSHEN. N. Y.. Nov. 30.â 12. II. Harrl
man, the railroad â¢ financier, has been In
dicted by the Grand Jury of Orange
County, on a charge of violating the eight
hour law. Harriman is president of the
Orange County Road Construction Com
pany and the indictment I* the outcome
of an agitation by representatives of or
ganized labor.
Driven to action by the persistent de
mands of the labor leaders in the county.
District Attorney Howelson laid before
the Grand Jury complaints that the con
struction company, which has a contract
for road improvement work calling for
an expediture of &200.000. was violating
the labor law. The Grand Jury had no
alternative but to find the indictments,
for the company made no secret that it
worked its men nine and ten hours, and
the law says that to work men more
than eight hours in public employment is
a misdemeanor. True * bills were found
against the officers of the company.
Other contractors were indicted, includ
ing Charles Sundstrom and Thomas
Lesher, who are engaged on sewer con
struction contracts in Mlddletown. Louis
Bedell, a member of the Assembly and
a close perfcnal friend of Governor
Odell. is secretary of the read construc
tion company.
There is much indignation that Harri
man and Bedell, who have been foremost
in public Improvements, should be in
dicted. Their superintendent, Charles T.
Ford, was arrested recently on the same
charge and released on ball. Harrlman.
in his desire to build roads that would
be a lasting benefit to the county, had
given instructions to go ahead and do the
work in the most satisfactory manner, re
gardless of expense, as he would bear
any additional expenses Incurred abovV
the amount appropriated by the county.

Special Dispatch' to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Nov. 30.â In a terrible
gale that recently, raged off the Oregon
coast the lumber bar^e Wheeler, bound
from Nehalem for San Francisco, bfoke
adrift from the tug Vosburg, turned tur
tle and went to the bottom, carrying her
crew of four men. News of the disaster
was brought to Astoria this morning by.
Captain Chris A. A hues of the Yosburg.'
It was dark when the barge broke loose
and a half hour after the towing line
parted her lights suddenly disappeared.
Search for the Wheeler will be made, but
there is not. the slightest hope that she
will be found. Captain Ahues told the
following story of his thrilling experience
to The Call correspondent: ; \:,
"The tug Vosburg, towing the lumber
barge '.Wheeler, was bound from Neha
lem for San Francisco. The barge had
a deck load of 525,000 feet of lumber. Soon
after leaving port we encountered a hard
southeast blow, which continued for forty
eight hours. We managed to keep head
on to the gale and succeeded In reaching
Coos Ray. where we remained for thicu
days.- On Monday, the weather being
clear and every condition favorable, wo
left Coos Bay. At 9 o'clock in the even
ing, while in the vicinity of Cape Blanco,
we ran into another southeaster. /Tho
blow rapidly increased In fury and by
midnight a galo was raging. On Tuesday
morning it was even more s.evere than
during the night, the barometer falling
steadily. At noon on Tuesday we weru
forty miles off Blanco, having drifted that
.far to the westward. A terrific sea was
running and we were unable to make
headway, confining our efforts to keeping
head-on to. the waves. ,v
Barge's Lights Disappear.
"On Wednesday the storm reached the
proportions of a hurricane, and both the
tug and the barge were rolling heavily
and shipping considerable water. ; , â¢
"At 7 o'clock that evening, in about lati
tude 42:55 north, longitude KS:53 west, the
towing* cable parted. A half hour later
the lights of the barge suddenly disap
peared, as if the vessel had turned turtle.
At this time a furious gale was raging
and the seas threatened to submerge the
tug. We were completely at the mercy of
the elements and not a man aboard had
the slightest Idea that the steamer would
ever live out the gale. However, a few
minutes after the lights of the barge disap
peared we ' managed to get the steamer
around and held her head-on to the gale.
In -the darkness it was impossible to see
ten yards ahead of the vessel and search
for the barge would have been futile. We
laid by until Thursday morning, but when
day broke we could see no trace of the
barge. .' \. - : - ;â¢ ,:.â â '. â â ;.; -.â â ::/.;â â /: V . â¢ .
' "As the towing steamer waa shipping
considerable water, we decided to run be
fore the gale. We continued on our
course until 9 o'clock Friday morning,
when the weather again moderated. At
11:30 o'clock in the forenoon we made Ya

"Just as soon as possible the Vosburg
will leave In search of the barge. I be
lieve the search will prove futile. During
tho gale and before the towing cable
parted the barge must have shipped much
water, and It Is my belief that when the
line broke thÂ« vessel was caught In the
seas and capsized. In no other way can
I account for the sudden disappearance

; The Wing and Wing Safe.
The schooner Wing and Wing, believed
to have been lost, reached port this after
noon. She, too. had a terrible experience
during the coast gales. She sailed from
8an Francisco on October 5 for Sluslaw.
arriving off the latter place on October
18. The condition of the weather made it
Impossible for Captain Anderson to reach
port. Then a gale came up and drove tho
schooner north. Since that time she his
been beating around off the coast, await

sprang a leak and it was necessary to
keep the pumps going day and night. Dur

Stanford Scalps the Indians.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 30.â The Stanford
ele\'en this afternoon defeated a team
from the Government Indian School at
Perrls by a score of 17 to 0. Although
the Indians averaged but 162 pounds, they
put up a fast, gritty game against their
more experienced opponents. Several
times the Indians held the varsity on
downs, once on their own five-yard line.
The reckless and sure tackling of the
Perils ends and backs prevented a larger
score. The game was marked by fre
quent stops for repairs, the Indians being
the RUffcrers in nearly every case. Lefl
Half Tortes sustained a badly broken
nose, but pluckily refused to leave the
field.
Wheelmen Will Eace on the Road.
The 8an Francisco Wheelmen will hold
their five-mile handicap road race this

bicycle race of the season.

FOR MONTEREY
Government Seeking a
Sitein tfie Old

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Nov. 30.â A telegram wan
received here laat night by Mayor R. P.
Johnson relative to the possibility of Mon
terey eupplylns/a suitable site for the per
manent military camp which the Govern
ment proposes to establish on this coast.
An informal meeting ""of citizens was at
once held in the Old Capital Club to con
sider the question. Measures to obtain the
necessary 1000 acres of land were taken.
Two possible sites were considered as
mcctlng&U the requirements, viz: A por
tion 0t the Jacks Tract, Just back of and
adjoining the present United States mili
tary reservation and the old Noche Bueno
rancho, east of town. The latter was fin
ally selected and the ownors of the va
rious holdings In tho tract were communi
cated with, each signifying willingness to
sell at a low figure. A committee of citi
zens will at once ba appointed to take up
the matter on behalf of tho town and to
confer with the proper. Government offi
cials relative to the purchase of the land.
Tho citizens of Monterey are greatly In
terested and arc eager to bring the' army
post to Monterey,' as it will be a great ad
vantage to tho mercantile . and 'farming
Interests of this section, and: the town Is
ready to make a liberal proposition to the
Government. From 2000 to 10,000 men, it Is
Â«ald, will be kept at the proposed post
constantly. . T â  i

enlisted and ha will do all that he can
to prevent a change.' Before going to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
J. PARIS. Nov. 30.â In order to compre
hend French domestic' politics during the
last week . It Is necessary first of .all to
grant what in philosophy is called a
postulate, which is ; peculiar to France
and which foreigners ' can only under
stand by eliminating their ordinary no
tions of things. : ~ - - ' r- . v :^
This postulate is: The only thing that
concerns the opposition is to overthrow
the Cabinet, while the majority is con
cerned " . , solely with : maintaining It in
power.'- There is no other programme.
Tho grand struggle that will be fought
out next year has already begun. :
; If you overlook this truth, you will be
able to understand " nothing, ' and every
thing will >eem absolutely silly, even to
the extent of anti-clericals voting for a
loan to indemnify missionaries, and cleri
cals voting against that same loan; and
further, of a government programme re
ceiving the support of revolutionists and
being attacked by that government's ad
herents."-:- .': â '.â :<â¢"' â¢â¢.;.â¢ >-.;â â  v :: :'v.> -r.-vs .--'â -:: 'â >
There was a projected loan of 256,000,000
francs, redeemable by Chinese Indemnity
payments . and Intended to* cover the ex
penses of the China expedition amounting
to 200,000,000 francs,' and to meet the dam
ages . sustained . by. private persons and
corporations, the sum of 65.000,000 francs.
The stumbling block was the missionary
question. "\.::.:.: ; ; â¢â¢;â¢â¢â¢ '.â ;â â "/.;: >-/
, It seems to have been proved that cer
tain missionaries took advantage . of the
entry into Peking of the allied forces to
lead the Christians ln a campaign of loot.
They even secured the assistance of sol
diers and sailors by paying the latter with
checks negotiable, in Paris.
. These facts were made public over six
months ago. General Voyron, who com
manded the French forces, confirms them
ln his official report, and it Is very un
likely that he would amuse himself by
recounting things that were not true' and
gratuitously calumniating the mis
sionaries.
THE DAY'S DEAD.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 30.â News has
just reached here of the death of Charles
A. White, a mining superintendent and
engineer well known throughout Cali
fornia. His demise occurred on Novem

in Pasadena with his family. For many
years he has been superintendent of a

raise the mustral standard. But for some
timfi it has done nothing and the once
famous amateur organization seemed to
have hef.n relegated to the usefulness of
yesterday. It appear? not. however, but
has taken on a new lease of life and id
now in a flourishinc; and mo*;t hopeful
condition. The secretary. E. M. Hecht,
reports 'a membership of foity, a gratify
ing attendance at rehearsals and h high
Ie\el of capacity among the players. The
orchÂ»*tra Is under the capable direction
of Glullo Mlnettl, and its directorate is as
follows:
President. Emil Greenebaum: vice pres
idem. Joseph WIHard; secretary. E. m!
H^cht; treasurer, Robert Hochstadter;
librarian. E. Swensen.
The s-oclcty has for its chlff object the
education of the amateur In the appreci
ation of orcheetral music, for which pur
pose symphonies, as well as lighter or
chestral fare will be the programme of
Htudy. Concerts are to be given from
time to time. Beethoven's' Flrtt Sym
phony has already been chosen for the
opening programme. Th<Â» rehearsals are
held en Monday evenings at Arion Hall.
It Is needless to insist on the value of
this kind of thing for the amateur musi
cian, and Mr. Minetti'g name in the con
nection at once stamps the high order of
usefulness promised by the organization.
The scene: Mme. Calve's apartments at
the Crocker. The time: One day last
week. The characters: Van Dyck, Calve
and a small audience of admirers. Mr.
Van Dyck tells the story on himself. He
n*as in some music-mad German town, eu
Â£aged to sing "Lohengrin" In the evening,
and during the day had developed a
"throat." It was not serious, but Just bad
enough to compel him to give up thtÂ»
idea of singing, at least for that
fivenlng. He accordingly notined the man
agement to that effect. "So far so good."
explains Mr. Van Dyck in his voluble
French. But two or three good friends of
his wander in during the evening and
persuade him that nothing is better for a
sore throat than a certain dish and vint
age to be had at a classic restaurant not
too far away. He yields imprudently but
Joyfully to their blandishments. They
reach the restaurant, and. the trouble

THE Call has frequently condemned the inutility of Indian education as fostered and car
ried on by the Federal Government, cither directly or indirectly, whefher in the scHools
at Hampton, Carlisle or elsewhere. The Indians so educatedare returned to the reserva- /
tions occupied by their tribes, where they are fed. in idleness by the Government, and their
education is worse .than useless, heretofore the ' Indian Bureau at^Washington has been a strong^
supporter of this scheme of culture for the red youth. The system involves much patronage and
the expenditure of a large amount of money, audits permanency seemed secure because it appeals
to a large class of Eastern philanthropists, who never- saw an Indian, and who fancy that racial
traits fade out when the alphabet is acquired, and that a red savage is 'changed, into * a Christian
gentleman -by memorizing the catechism. " .. ' '/ ' , â ,
. Now, however, there is in Mr. Jones an Indian Commissioner whose ideas rise above pat
ronage, and who is superior to the small tactics required to hold the misdirected philanthropists
in.Hne.;- : ;V- :^ v -;.v'^ â  â â  â¢ â 
; ; /Mn his current report he condemns "the Indian schools and the whole misguided scheme of,
which they are a part. Of these boarding -schools there are ;i6, with an average attendance of?
16,000 pupils between the ages'. ;'6f 5 and â ; 2 1 â¢ These coins from the shack, tepee and wickiup,
taken promiscuously from their parents, without selection according to natural brightness or
quality above their fellows. The Commissioner says that fp.nn the squalor and vermin of the res
ervation they are taken to the boarding : school, well .fed and clothed, with rn,atrons to* wait^on
them in health and. doctors and nurses when sick. Their clothes are washed in the laundry. They
have access to a library, gymnasium and music. Ail of the necessities and many of the luxuries of
life are theirs without ..effort on their part. .â¢ â¢- '
* When their education is finished; tlicy arc sent back to the -shack, the tepee and the
wickiup of their fathers, back to the squalor and vprmin of the reservation, and to its vice and '
idleness. - \* y â¢ \ \ v > â¢ â¢ ' ' . / ;* 'â  ''â¢';â¢. .â '-x.:'. .'. â  '
Their education 'cost-* them nothing ami its value is not appreciated. Its use is impossible.
Its benefit is nowhere apparent. In this; futile, foolish and really injurious effort the Government
has spent .$45,000,000 in twenty years in educating 20,000 Indians, who have survived the opera
tion and returned to their tribes, and there i-r no record of a single individual in that score of thou
sands putting to the least use the training which cost so much. 'â  '" - _ "
The Commissioner points out a -similar result of our policy on the reservations. The Gov
ernment furnishes to the Indian, farmers to plow land for him and raise crops, while he on
indifferently. He is not becoming a farmer nor a mechanic. He is simply walking pigeon-to_ed,
looking through his eyebrows, gearing a Government blanket and waiting for the Government

But it is not his fault It is the fauit of the zealous folk who make a fad out of philan
thropy. They have attempted to give the Indian the last stage of civilization first. They are
people who would build houses by beginning with the roof, and plant orchards by putting the
tree-tops in the air instead of the roots in the ground. If they would 1 go among the Zunis,
Moquis and Navajoes of Netf Mexico, the Pueblo Indians, and- study their ways they would be

sion and pity. But note th^ difference in the Pueblos. They tend flocks, spin and weave, turn
the potter's wheel and burr, earthenware. They build houses, have , firesides, " raise grain and
grind it, and are well advanced in that next stage of progress that follows subsistence by -the
chase. No white man taught them these arts. They learned to draw a thread and make a loom
and weave 'without his help. The Pueblo women make their own clothing and dress in aÂ» most
neat and attractive fashion. They are not stolid and dirty, but clean 'and; yfyaciousvvVirttiQUs^and
orderly. They are helping themselves up the, slow path to civilization, and support themselves on
the way. Once they followed game in the chase, then became^ flock owners and nomads;

Instead of studying them, the Government has taken his hunting grounds away from the
reservation Indian and given him no flocks and herds in their place, and is attempting to make
him self-supporting on differential calculus, logarithms and the " higher criticism." X
Supplementing the report of the Indian Commissioner comes that of Governor McConnell
of Idaho, indian Inspector, on the physical harm done in the ; Indian boarding schools. He.savs
that children afflicted with scrofula, consumption and niore^lpatlisome diseases are put in the
same room and frequently in the same bed with the healthy. ' Last summer, in speaking to the
Indian Service Institute at Detroit, he said: â 'In your efforts to civilize and christianize the In
dian, if that is your motive, pause to consider whether the In lian mother would not prefer an un
educated living child to an educated dead one. 1 have in mind one reservation from which three
lots o( children were takei. to training and boarding schools. Out of the first lot of fifteen
eleven died at school or shortly: after being sent home in the last stages of disease. Out of another
lot of four three died, and of the third company of fifty-four twenty-three died in school, twelve
were permanent invalids and only nineteen survived in good health. l\om another reservation
in one company of twenty-si.v twenty-one died, and in a second- lot of- .twenty-one sixteen died.
Have we the moral right to take from these poor untutored mothers their offspring and place
them in/these charnel houses?" > v
It is to be hoped that With the solid foundation of fact furnished by the Commissioner and
Inspector, and with the help of the example of the Pueblo Imlians, there may soon come a com
plete revolution in the treatment of our Indian problem; â  , v ,
A FIGHT FOR PURE GREEK
WHEN the recent reports came of riots in Athens caused by a protest of the univer
sity students against the proposed translation of the New Testament into modern
Greek, the affair seemed to the American public a little more unreasonable than anv
thing ever before committed by a university man. Various efforts were made to ex
plain the situation, with but little success. It was known that many priests were on the, side of
the students, and from this fact the conclusion." was drawn thut the riots were the outcome of i ome
kind of religious conservatism revolting: against progress, much in the same way as many sincere
people in' this country protested* against the revision of the New Testament, when that work
was first undertaken. ; : ; -:.--/-^ ; V:. . y/i- Â« .'. . / : 'v, : .>;vv- . 'v \ v '-. â â :â .. â  w^- : ::>v- . â  y:-:-^^ -,-, - --.-.::;.-r-
It now appears by reports from Athens that the riots were in no" way prompted by rel^ion
and that the priests were only incidentally associated with it. The contest is one of Hteralure^and
of language. During the many years that Greece was subject to Turkish i rule there w^
duced into the language many foreign words and idioms. Most of the innovations were of Slavonic
origin, and as a consequence the common language of the Greeks is now jargelyjintermixed with
Slav. Ever since the establishment of the independence of Greece *â¢ it has been' the aim of the
cultured Greeks to restore the purity of their tongue. To achieve that end they have relied upon
'the universities and the church. In those centers of learning and of education pure Greek has
been taught, and it has been- the hope of the patriots that the peasants-^ami lower classes would
also eventually acquire the pure language; ',> -^ â  '^â â ^h^^ \X:Vy)^h>^':-y - : '^ - -
/ : It will be seen that; the proposalto'ttanslate the Testament into the vernacular; semi-bar
baric Greek would interfere with ; the plans; of the higher classes, who wish to preserve "the Testa
ment as an instrtiction .book in classic; Greelc.,y Hence the; outcry' that the translation would tenfi
to subordiiiate Greece^tothe Slavs. Iii their eyes the proposed' translation appears very much as
it would appear to â  (is if the United "States Government should; propose to translate -the Testa
ment into some sort of dialect story. The student* riots then vvere parts of a struggle for the
preservation

GRANDAMES WILL POINT
IN YEARS TO COME TO
ARTISTS IN THE "DON"
IT I* opera, nothing but opera ana
again opera here this week and until
Thursday night next the programme
will continue to remain .the same. The
particular triumph of the week^ at
present writing Is the "Don PaÂ«quale" of
last Wednesday night, with Individual
successes of exultant kind for Sembrlch
and hardly less for Scotti and.Tavecchla.
The performance of "Don Pasquale" Is
one to which grandames will point back
in years to come to wondering children
an when they heard Sembrlch and Scotti
sing this duct or that aria, or Tavecchia
revel in tho fat fun and quaint pathos of
the bedeviled old bachelor's part. It is
already classic, and with "Le Nozze dl
Figaro" "ranks as the chief gift ef the
season. If one did not always feel the
last the best with Mme. Sembrich one
would be persuaded to imagine her Norlna
her most luscious effort. But those other
coquettish damsels. Roslna and Susanna,
alfo clamor for precedence and who can
choose among them? The Marguerite
stands by Itself, and though beautifully
sung is not in tune with tho singer's key
note somehow.. Melba's Marguerite,
strangely enough. Is markedly Its super
ior, both In vocal accord and emotional
essence. *
â  But to return to the "Don." All singers
love to sing its uprightly measures. It
Is among the most becoming of vocal
music, and not least among the charms
of the Wednesday night performance was
the evident enjoyment of the artists in
their roles. I can conceive ' no â¢ better
Dottore Malatesta than that of Mr. Scotti.
whose distinguished vocal and histrionic
gifts were never more In evidence. Ho
has a superb technique, using his big
voice with an amazing freedom and light
ness. Tavecchia- has an even rarer gift,
he Is* the best singer and. actor of buffo
rolea that has been heard here for many
years and his Don Pasquale could not be
bettered on any side. It was a perform
ance all round that would have 'amazed
and delighted Donizetti, though the man
who knows tells me that .the opera loses
appieclably by being given in so large a
house. It was not particularly noticeable
the other night though.
"The Girl From Maxim's." a French
farce with a reputation, comes to the
Columbia to-morrow night. "With it
comes Miss Lena Mervllle. " v .
With the 1 patsing of Colonel James
Henry Mapleson. who died In London on
November II of Brijthfa disease, one of
the most genial and impressive figures
among operatic managers has gone from'
view. TheDramatlc Mirror of the 23d ult.
has the following sketch of his life that
will be of Interest to all opera-goers',
morn especially to the older generation:
Colonel Mapleson was born in' London
on May 4, 1830. In his boyhood he became
a student at the Royal Academy of
Music In London, where he learned sing
ing and violin playing. While still in his
teens he made several appearances as a
vocalist and in , IMS be . became . a â¢ mem
ber, of the orchestra at Her Majesty's
Theater. Between seasons, In 1849, ' he
ventured upon his flrat managerial enter
prise; by taking a concert, company on
a tour of the provinces. In the following
year he made another concert tour.* Upon
returning to London he became the musi
cal critic of a publication, called The At
*hu. * . - .". ' 'â -â  . â¢ ' ; " â¢
In 1851- he gave up his managerial and
critical work and went to Italy to con
tinue his studies In. vocal music. He re
mained there, ft. pupil of Maszucato, for
ti.ree years, and in 1S54 returned to Lon
don and reappeared as a concert ainjer.
Alter a very few appearances hÂ« began
to suffer from a malady of the throat. *.
surgical operation was deemed necessary
and was performed. The, result of it wa*
tho. complete destruction of Mr. Maple
son's slntin* voice. Being obliged to give
up his dream of gaining artistic honors,
Mr. t Mapleson w turned again to manage
ment. In 1S36 he established the ttrst mu
sical agency In London, and In 1S68 lie

became an assistant to E. T. Smith, man
ager of the opera at the Hay market The
ater. Whej> Mr. Smith retired. In 1861,
Mr. Mapleson took over the management
of . the Lyceum Theater and for a year
produced Italian opera there, . â ",- â 
FromKC to 1S68 Mr. Mapleson managed
Her Majesty's Theater, where he pro
duced many Italian operas. When Her
Majesty's was destroyed by flre In lSÂ«a Â»
Mr. Mapleson .took, the' Theater BoyaQ
which he managed almost uninterruptedly
until 1S77.? In. that; year he- opened Her
Majesty's, which had been, rebuilt, and
; enjoyed there â¢ a season- .of ' brilliant
operatic success. During the. fifteen years
of Mr. Mapleson's continuous manage
ment In London he had among the mem
bers of his several companies Tletjen*,
Albani. Glnglinil Delle Sedle. Trebelli.
the Marchisio sisters. Bochartlt. Bettlni.
Santley. Gerster. Minnie Hauk. DÂ«t
Puente. Vallerla. Frapoli. Dl Murslta.
Mario, GrisI, Chrlstme Nilsson. Cam
pnninl and Galassi.
In the autumn of 1S77 Mr. Maplesonâ
who bad now become "Colonel" Mapl-
sonâcrossed the Atlantic for the" flrat
time, bringinc to New York an opera com
pany such, aa had never been seen, herd
before. At the Academy of Music. In De
cember, WT7. he opened his first American
season. Colonel Mapleson brought tho
organization to the Academy In the sea
sons of 1S7S. 1SS0. ISM. 1S84. 1885 and 1SSS.
Besides the slnpers already mentioned, he
: had under his direction during his Ameri
can seasons Adellna Pattl. Emma Juch.
ZeHe de Lussan. Marie Van Zandt. Kel
logg. Ravelll. Scalchl. Nordlca. Emma
Nevada. Cary and Marie EngJe.
The opening of the Metropolitan Ooera
house in 1SS3 proved a severe blow to Col
onel Mapleson's enterprises in New York.
He battled courageously against the op
position that It presented, but In the end
was conquered. â  He returned to London
in 1SSS and took a part of his comoanv
on a concert tour of England. In 1S9S he
organized the New ImDerial Opera Com
pany, which *pBÂ«ared in England and In
America. But the day of Italian opera.

NO DRILLS IN DECEMBER
FOR THE GUARDSMEN
Prospect of Reorganization on United
StaUi Army Lines Meets
Approval.
December being the month when the
men who compose the bulk of the Na
tion Guard of California are busy on ac
count of the holiday season, there will
not be any drills in the armories until
after the flrat meeting next January.
The recommendations of the Secretary
of War in, relation to the national guard
of the different States has been fully dis
cussed by the rank and die in this city,
and the general opinion is that if the
Ideas of the" Secretary were carried out
the guard in each, State would be In
much better condition than at present in
case It is called upon for active service.
The suggestion that the guard should be
armed as. Is the regular army is favored
because It is claimed that there is no
good reason why there should be two
kinds of arms in the service, particularly
as the guard knows not when It may be
called upon to serve with the regulars.
If there should be a change it would
undoubtedly arouse a spirit of military
enthusiasm which has been remarkably
on the wane of late, particularly in this
city. â  ' ' ; - 'â â  . : ' "â â "'â  : â¢ â â  ;
The division commander has' been re
quested to. permit the Fifth Infantry
Regiment to hold a regimental camp next
year. It is likely that permission will be
granted and, if it is. the camp will be
conducted on the lines of ' the regular
army. This regiment has made arrange
ments for the next year's regimental
shoot. â  â¢ â¢ .*
There is a coldness between the bat
teries of the artillery battalion, all on ac
count of social relations. The batteries
are C and O of the old First, known as
the Nationals, and F and K of, the same
regiment, but 'are now known by their
artillery letters. i-The four occupy 'i the
Hllts-strett armory, and some time since it
was suggested that all four should form a
grand social organization and everything
was arranged, when It was discovered
that two men belonging to Captain
Cunningham's command were unsatisfac
tory to those who compose the Nationals,
and a request was made that they be dis
charged from the service. The reason as
signed was not deemed sufficient and the
request was denied. That broke off all
social prospects between the Nationals
and the other two batteries.
Arrangements are being perfected for
active work on board the Marlon by
the naval mtlttla after the flrst week In
January. ' ->
There will be a grand promenade con
cert and naval militia ball. in Odd Fel
lows'' Hall on the evening of the 5th
Inst. under the auspices of the engineer
division and band of the Naval Mtltla of
California. The committee In charge ex
pects that this function will be one of
the most brlllian affairs ever given under
any branch of the organization.

I Intend to be soon. It was my wish to

to personal business reasons we have put
the event off for a week or two." AvVY
Just then Edward Webb, the tenor,: of

again Insisted it was not true. â¢â  : V- x
However, it was true, and the event
occurred on the evening prior to Thanks

Kission Police Station Moved.
The Mission police station, which was
located on Howard and Seventeenth
streets for the past twenty-three years, is
a thing of the. past. Lieutenant Ander
son and hts family of bluecoats packed
their official belongings yesterday and
shifted Quarters to the new building at
Folsom and Seventeenth streets. . The new
station is poorly adapted for Its purpose.
There Is no accommodation for the
horses or patrol wagon. This auxiliary to
the modern equipment of a pQllce station
Is two blocks away from the station, with
no better facilities for responding to calls
than what the telephone service affords.
The cells are patched up from material
taken from the City Hall Prison and
screwed to the floor, in a temporary sort
of way. The rooms set apart for the use
of the sergeants are so crowded that there
Is not room for a man to pass behind his
neighbor without disturbing him at his
desk, while the place set apart for the
prison-keeper is commodious enough to
afford sufficient room for the County
Clerk to transact his official business.

WRITE RIGHT.
"Scatter Decent, Helpful Things."
Good, philosophical Ras Wlleon once
eaid to & new reporter: "Young man,
write as you feel, but try to feel right.
Be good humored toward every one and
everything. Believe that other folks are
just as good as you are. for they are.
Give 'cm your best and bear In mind that
God has. sent them, in his wisdom, all
the trouble they need, and it is for you
to scatter gladness, and decent, helpful
things as you go. Don't be particular
about how the stuff will look In print but
let 'ergo. Some one will understand.
That is better than to write so dosh blng
high, cr so tarnasbun deep, deep that no
one understands. Let 'er go." \ .

BY A PECULIAR FOQ
Unusually Heavy Rainfall Through

The weather yesterday throughout al
most the whole of California was cloudy
during the early part of the day and
foggy toward nightfall. In San Francisco
the for became very dense late in tbe
afternoon, and at times was so thick that
objects could not be distinguished across
Market street. It was, according to Fore
caster McAdle. an unusual kind of fog for
this section of the country.
Its cause is traceable to a strong current
of cold dry air from the east coming In
contact with the moist atmosphere of the
ceast. It is known to meteorologists as
the tuto fog. It was confined almost
wholly to the land, so that little fears are
entertained on Us account for the vessels

SHAKEN DOWN

Governor Gaga Gives , Com
missions to Geary's r ,}
â  '.'; Cominittee. '
' A meeting of the executive commfttee
of the late Chinese Exclusion Convention
met at the Lick House last evening in
response to a special call Issued by the
chairman, 5 * Thomas J: Geary.^ The execu
tive committee now consists 4 of forty-one
members, % the; number having been in
creased since It was created. The pur
pose of the session last'nlgnt was to con
sider ways and means to defray expenses
of maintaining headquarters In Washing
ton and to provide for. the printing of the
proceedings of the convention.' An Inter
esting discussion grew out of the proposi
tion to print the debates. It was sus
pected by several members that Mayor
Phelan was nursing fc scheme to edit
the reports by excluding the speeches of
representatives of the Labor party- The'
Mayor 'produced a hot air letter from
Washington, asking: that 'a printed 'report 1
of convention proceedings be transmitted,
at once to the national capital.' J. H. :
Parry contended 'that the secretary's re
port'of the proceedings should be placed
in the possession of the executive com
mittee, which was created to execute the
will of the convention. * , â ''â . * â  : â  V.
Parry Entertains a Fancy.
He fancied that instead of appointing a
committee to prepare the report for the
printer a committee should be appointed
to get possession of the report. It was
maintained that the proper custodian was
John McLaughlln, secretary of the execu
tive committee, although the official rec
ords of the session seemed to be in the
hands of N. A. Mason and Mayor Phelan.
The pressure for the possession of the
papers became eo strong that the Mayor
yielded and the 'official account of the
convention's work will be supervised by
the executive committee and John Mc-
Laughlln. â  '
It is said that Mr. Parry, chairman of
the ; executive committee of the Union
Labor party, suspecting that Phelan was
scheming to do Democratic politics, made
several requests during the past week
that the report of the proceedings be
transferred to the secretary of the con
vention's executive committee, but was
foiled by N. A. Mason and the Mayor.
â¢ Programme Is Clear.
The new programme is that the press
committee shall edit the report and that
Union Labor party speakers, as well as
Democratic wind-jammers, shall be/rep
resented in the printed record.
Governor Gage has ordered that the
great seal of the State shall be affixed
to the commissions of the committecmen
appointed by Thomas J. Geary to visit
Washington. The Governor appends his
official signature to the commisclons.*
Thus armed with letters from Governor
Gage. Phelan, Budd. LJvernash, Beale
and Furuseth will proceed to Washing
ton. As California gave a Republican ma
jority of 40.000 at the last Presidential
election, and as both houses of Congress
are Republican, people may wonder why
a Republican Governor did not Issue com
missions to Republicans.
It Jb" figured that C500 or $3000 will be a
sum sufficient to maintain headquarters
In Washington and an office in San Fran
cisco. ' â¢ - ' - <' ; .

OIL CASE GOES
TO COMMISSION
Attorney? dnBoth Sides
.Finish Their Ar-
Board Will Be Ready -to
, ; Render Decision -^ on > ;
)>\ â¢ j Monday Next/; ; :
' .The attorneys: for and against the restor
ation of the original oil rates from Ba
kersileld to San Franclsco ; were j heard
; yesterday morning and afternoon, by ! the
Railroad Commission. Frank N. Short
opened -for the oil producers. He was
succeeded by J. JL. Norton, attorney for.
;the Santa Ke and J. F. Foulds 6f the
Southern Pacific. W." H.. Herrin closed
for the railroad. 'Short then replied to
the combined arguments of the railroad
, solicitors. . The commission adjourned
until Monday at 11 o'clock, when It will
hand down a decision, all the arguments
having been made.
W. A. Blssell, freight traffic agent of
the Santa Fe, was called . to the stand
and testified to a one cent per barrel rate
which the Southern Pacific charged the
Santa Fe on the spur from Bakersfield.to
the oil resions. Short claimed that as the
usyal rate was five and seven cents per
barrel to other patrons this was a dis
crimination forbidden by Jaw and should
be Inquired into. Faulds" argument was
directed to this 1 point. He contended that
the discrimination was not a favor, but
for actual service, and that all the re
ports In every State showed that this Is
permissible. . 'â :{
Frank Short argued for cheap fuel and
the necessity of a low rate on oil to se
cure it for the people. He said the Kern
River people were the competent : -wit
nesses to testify about the production of
i oil and not the Los Angeles men, who had
been called' upon to prove the railroad's
case. He said that the Valley road
should be taken, not as a single road, but
i as a part of a great system and If the
i returns showed a deficit for operation of
this branch alone, that should not be con
sidered. It is a part of the Santa. Fe
which pays big Interest, the attorney
said. A restoration of the original rate
would work against the Interest of the
State and retard development.
J. lu Norton claimed In behalf of the
Santa Fe that as long as a carrier could
not justify a high rate on a domestic
road to meet an Interstate deficit the re
verse would apply. Herrin reviewed the*
testimony, alleging that it did not bolster
up the cause of the oil people, but really
weakened their original case. He said
that If the decision was adverse the privi
lege of asking for an Injunction might be
resorted to. In fact, he practically ad
mitted that this would be the next step
taken If the commission adhered to Its
former ruling:. _ â¢
Attorney Short closed with a short and
general review.
/ADVERTISEMENTS.
CAUSE OF_DEAFNESS.
Ih*? Most Common Causa Only Re-
cently Discovered. v }
It has been stated on good medical au-
thority that nine-tenths of cases of deaf-
ness are caused from catarrh or from sore
throat trouble.
' The little tube which leads to tbe ear
from the throat Is lined with a sort of vel-
vety structure called mucous membrane.
This membrane is simply a continuation
of the mucous membrane lining: of the
throat. When disease of any sort attacks
the mucous membrane of the. throat it is
.very liable to extend into ths Eustachian
tube and ud into the ear.
The history of nearly all cases ef deaf-
ness is like this: a, cold is contracted and
neglected, other â¢ colds are taken, the
throat becomes sore and Inflamed, which
is aggravated by particles of dust and
germs from the air. Th!Â« condition causes
the disease to spread into the tube that
leads to the ear.
It seems a little far fetched to say that
most cases of deafness are cau&ed from
catarrh, but it is certainly true, and any
one .who has had a severe catarrhal cold
must have noticed how the hearing was
aftVctcd while the cold lasted.
With catarrh sufferers this Impairment
of hearing becomes chronic and grows
worse the longer the catarrh Is neglected.
You can cure catarrh and deafness by
the regular use of an excellent new prepa-
ration called Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
composed of antiseptic remedies, which act
both on the mucous membranes but prin-
cipally and most effectually on the blood,
eliminating the catarrhal poison from the
system. â  *â  *
People whese hearing is defective may
thlr.k it a little remarkable that a simple
and. harmless tablet would very often re-
move all traces of deafness, but when It
is 'remembered that catarrh causes the
deafness and that the catarrh is easily
cured by the regular use of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets there Is no mystery about it.
If you are subject to nasal catarrh or 1
catarrh of throat, bronchial tubes or ca-
tarrh of stomach and liver, the safest and
most effective treatment Is the new ca-
tarrh specific. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
sold by all druggists at 50 cents for full-
sized package.

SEMBRICH AND CALVE APPEAR
BEFORE TWO BIG AUDIENCES
Grau's Singers Heard to
the Very Best Ad
vantage.
Enthusiastic Applause
Rewards Efforts, of
Artists.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
1AM persuaded that not even yet has
Calve been heard at her best. Last
night "Carmen" was again given at
.the Grand Opera-house, and to an Im
mense house In spite of fears that the'
singer might again disappoint. It was not
an enthusiastic house until nearing the
close of the opera, at the end of the third
act, and after the final curtain, to be par
ticular. . â¢
The singer was in lovely voice, every
trace of the former fatigue and hoarse
ness gone. It Is a voice of rare and beau
tiful quality, something of the ' flute,
something of the oboe, but above all a
characteristic timbre peculiar to the
singer. It is clear, warm, rarely sweet
and splendidly controlled, and of remark
able evenness throughout its wide range.
She can do anything she pleases with It,
and I think, feel, that she can do more
even than she did last night
It is said that Calve's Carmens are
never twice alike. Certainly her last
night's effort differed widely not only In
detail but In essence, from her first per
formance of the part, for the better
mostly, but not entirely. The vocal effort
was . deliclously beautiful, yet stopped
short of complete satisfaction; the last
sensitive note of - satisfaction coming
from the singer's happiness In her work,
for Calve was In hurt and wounded mood
last night. She came on after the third
act with her eyes filled with tears to bow
acknowledgment to an audience that she"
felt had heard, and perhaps in part be
lieved, the various canards about her .that
have adorned some newspapers of late.
One felt it In her action, but she forgot
herself at times and then showed glimpses
of one of the greatest conceptions that
now grace the stage. Her art reminds
strongly of that of Bernhardt. lithe, im
passioned, and In the highest degree art
istic. It is easy to play Carmen as the
common woman of the street, who usually
shows up In the role, but It is quite an
other thing to make of. her what Calve
makes of her. Perhaps It is a creation
rather than an Interpretation. It is Merl
mee. but Merimee plus Calve, the sumptu
ous animal of the author together with
the refinement of the artist. Her card
scene again thrilled the house, though It
was amazingly different from the first
night's work, while the last act was im
measurably better. The dance scene
again was different, and not so beaatlful
as before, but counting in the beauty of
the vocal work, those who heard Calve
last night heard the best of her so far,
yet not the best that the great singer has
to give, I am persuaded.
Miss Scheff sang Mlcaela's part last
night, and though a shade too coquettish
WOMAN PLANS
BOLD ROBBERY
Causes Fifty Thousand
Dollars to Be Stolen
and Hidden.
CITY OF MEXICO. Nov. 20.â About a
year ago robbers entered the house of an
elderly lady named Vasquez and her wid
owed daughter, Scnora Campello, and
were said to have stolen $30,000. The po
lice arrested five men, who were tried and
sentenced to prison for long terms. It now
appears the affair was a plot to prevent
the money being left to a church. It Is
alleged a woman, who is a member" of the
Vasquez family, planned thc robbery,
employing a friend under a promise of re
ward to get men to pretend to steal the
money. The robbers entered the house
and secured a small amount of money and
Jewelry, the larger sum having been hid
den.
The man who was employed to engineer
the supposed steal, not receiving the re
ward, confessed and this lutl to the police
searching the house and finding the $50,000.
The money was taken away arid deposited
In the National Bank of Mexico.
The men now in prison expect a new
trial and mitigated sentences.
The woman who is said to have planned
the alleged robbery has beer, arrested and
will be further interrogated. Sensational
developments are Expected.

for the simple maid, yet added happily to
the effect by her dramatic strength. She
sang charmingly, and received a flatter
ing meed of applause all to herself. '
De Marchl was again the Don Jose, and
nobly filled all vocal requirements, and in
spots more than satisfied dramatically.
Escamillo was sung by Mr. Journet, who
was heavy in the Toreador song, but did
some acceptable work later. Flon con
ducted a little raggedly at times, but with
more than his usual spirit.
Tho second performance of "II Barblere
dt tilvlglla" at the Grand Opera-house
failed to draw quite so large a crowd yes
terday afternoon as on its first production.
There was no lack in the enthusiasm with
which the sprightly opera was received,
however, and the singers all did quite
their best save Mme. Sembrich. Perhaps
the phenomenal fog that ntnrked the day
may account for It, but the singer wan
not at her utmost, a slight strain being
noted in the upper tones occasionally. She
was otherwise entirely satisfying as
usual, piquant and charming, . and her
Roslna remains a thing of rare beauty
and a Joy for to-morrow as well as to-day.
She sang again the Johann Strauss "Voce
dl Prlmavera," a brilliant aria, in the
"lesson scene," and gave as the three
encores she graciously uccorded, "Ah! non
Glunge." the "Maiden's Wish" of Chopinâ
to her own charming accompanimentâ
and a "Cradle Song" of Relss. the same
numbers as before. She was bombarded
with flowers at the close of the scene.
De Reszke was in his usual, splendid
formâ I wonder If he is ever out of It?
His Don Baslllo fills the last requirement
of the pan and is one of the most deli
clously absurd portraits of the stage. As
the barber himself, Campanari is very
happy, and his last Figaro was better
than his first. 'He sang admirably yester
day, with a vigor and spontaneity that
left nothing to be desired. Tavecchla's
Bartolo was a repetition of his first per
formance, and as such was the beat read
ing of the part that late years have given
us. He has the manner to perfection and a
rich humor that rounds the character
into an astonishing plausibility. Salignac's
Almavlva fills a pleasant place and he Is
hea.'d at his best In the part. Miss Bauer

"BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA" IS
RENDERED IN THE
AFTERNOON
"Carmen" Is Presented
in Rare Manner
: at Nighji. ; o *
TWO vast audiences yesterday dis
played the intense hold that the
Grau Grand Opera Company haa
upon the public of this city.
The end of the third week of
the season found the Grand Opera-house
tested to Its capacity at the matinee and
night' performances. Mme. Sembrlch
again sang In "II Barblere dl Slviglla" In
the afternoon and Mme. Calve made her
reappearance at night in "Carmen."
That Mme. Sembrlch Is the brlsrht par
ticular star of the Grau combination was
shown by the tremendous reception she
received yesterday afternoon. â¢ In the'fa
mous "lesson scene" she. was pelted with
bouquets by those in the audience near
the stage and so persistent was the ap
plause that the diva was comoelled to
give four encores ere her admirers would
allow the opera to proceed.
Ninety per cent of the afternoon au
dience was composed of women and they
were In raptures of delight over Mme.
Sembrlch and those who were associated
with her.
That there was an intense desire to see
and hear Calve was shown last night by
the crush at the Grand Opera-house. At
7 p. m. there was a line of men and
women waiting to buy general admission
tickets that stretched from the doom of
thc theater along Mission street and half*
way up Third street to Market.
The* leaders of society evidently feared
that Calve might again disappoint by not
appearing and considerable surprise was
expressed at the majority of the boxes
being empty. The season's subscriptions
for boxes ended with the matinee â  per
formance of yesterday.
While the theater was crowded last
night it was not a "gala" evening by any
means. There were scores of women ele
gantly dressed and many prominent peo
ple were present, but the gathering was
not a "society function." â¢
Mme. Calve won the heartiest applause
of thc audience and she war In splendid
voice. Calve's great charm is her acting.
If Calve was not a.prlma donna she would
be just as popular as an actress. Once
during the performance she gave evidence
of the cold that kept her out of the bill
laat week. . - . â¢ â¢
The entire performance went with a
swing that was lacking In the first pre
sentation of the opera and those who
came to see and hear Calve showed they
were satisfied by the lavish approval they
gave to the artist. â¢
To-night "Lohengrin" will be given at
popular prices, .with Gadskl, Louise
Homer, Dlppel, Muhlmann, Blass and Bis
pham in the cast.
The six extra performances at reduced
prices that commence with the matinee
to-morrow are likely to- fill the theater to
Its capacity.
"Le Nozze dl Figaro," with Eames and
Sembrlch in the cast. Is the matinee at
traction for to-morrow.
In the evening "La Boheme" Is to be
repeated, with Susanne Adamr Frllzl
Schorr, De Marchl, Dufrlche, Vfnni and
Scotti In the principal roles, to be followed
by "Cavallcrla Rustlcana," with Calve as
Santuzza. In this role Calve appeared in
Paris for four weeks' to a Berles of over
flowing houses. , â¢
1 On" Tuesday' Â»nlght Wagner's ' "Tristan
uud Isolde" will be sung for the first time
in San Francisco. .
On Wednesday night "Carmen" will bo

OF BIG BRIBERY
Former Court Bailiff Dis
c'oses Secrets in
Chicago.
Sensational Testimony Is
Given in Ihs Sullivan
Trial.
CHICAGO. Nov. 30.â Former Bailiff
James J. Lynch, the confessed jury
briber; on whose testimony Alexander
Bafixvaa. an attorney, wras indicted for
cor.s-Tiracy. took the stand in Judgi
Smiths court to-day and immediately
launched into a story of juries which he
he had bribed in behalf of Sullivan.
Sullivan, Lynch testified, was attorney
for thc West Chicago Street Railroad
Company and represented the company
in defending damage suits. He said he
talked frequently with Sullivan in regard
to bribing juries.
"Sullivan told me.** said Lynch, "when
ever possible to get hold of an Irish Cath
olic on the jury and to tell him that the
plaintiff was an A.. P. A., and that he
should be beaten, as he was an enemy of
the church. The sums paid jurors ran
from $50 to JIM. Sometimes I bribed one
and in some cases as high as three. I
was raid the same amount, as the Juror,
but when there was more than one man
to be bought I was paid less per man."
"Can you recall where Sullivan paid
you the money for your work?" Assist
ant State's Attorney Barnes asked.
"Yes; ln the county building hall, in his
oSee and once, I remember, in the
Judge's chambers when the Judge was
out"
Counsel for Sullivan attempted to have
Lynch's testimony confined strictly to
direct evidence of a conspiracy, but they
were overruled. It is alleged that Sulll
vsn and others conspired to keep Lynch
oÂ»t of the jurisdiction of thÂ« Cook
County courts following the exposure of
the bailiff.

MRS. BONINE'S
LAWYER SPEAKS
Statement Is Made by
Defense in the Mur
der Case.
Evidence to Be Given About
the Killing of Young
Ayers. â¢ i
WASHINGTON. Nov. 30.â The Govern
ment to-day closed its case in the trial
of Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine for the killing
of James Seymour Ayers Jr., and Attor
ney Kcene of counsel for the defense
made a preliminary statement in behalf
of Mrs. ttoniuc. It was evident from
Keone's statement that the effort would
be to show lack of motive for the shoot
ing on the part of Mrs. Bonine and to
support her plea that Ayers was killed
in a strusgle after he had tried to in
timidate her with a revolver.
The principal witness on the stand to
day was Professor Schaefer, a chemist,
who made a microscopical examination of
the wrapper worn by Mrs. Bonine on the
night of the tragedy and who said that
he found no traces of blood upon it. He
also said that he saw no blood on the
slippers which she had worn on that oc
casion.
Another witness of the day was Ayers'
father, who told of an Interview he had
had with Mrs. Bonine three or four days
after the killing. He outlined his efforts
to arouse her sympathy, but said that she
did not respond.
In his preliminary statement for the
woman Attorney Keene contended In the
beginning for due consideration of the
presumption of innocence. This, he said.
was evidence, not a mere formality. It
was not the purpose of the defense to
minimize the offense of which his client
was charged, for it was undeniable that
the tragedy had fallen heavily upon two
families. Many guests of the Kenmore
were to be Introduced, said Keene. and
he believed it would be shown that the
character of the people living there was
zood.
Keene called attention to the fact that
Mrs. Bonine was chosen as a leader in
the social festivities of the hotel and this
choice, he said, fell upon her because of
her capacity. The defense would show
that she had taught seven young men to
dance. In December a dance ot more
than ordinary importance had been given
and young Ayers had appeared there so
much Intoxicated that he was offensive to
those in attendance and Mrs. Bonine had
been compelled to ask a friend of the
young man to get him to retire. This
incident had. he said, led to some discord.
Continuing Keene said it would be
shown that in getting up the dances Mrs.
Bonine had visited the rooms of all per
sons, regardless of sex or age. who could
dance, to get them to participate. It
could also be shown that Mrs. Bonine was
fond of medicine and that this fondness
had served her ln ministering to the sick
ar.d that she did visit many of them.
Another point which would be developed
was that the relations between Ayers and
Mrs. Bonine were not suctj as to cause
them to feel unwilling to break them.
Proof would also be given that on March
4 Mrs. Bonine had reproved Ayers for
drinking and that while some coolness
resulted there was no strong feeling, as
was shown by the fact that on the Mon
day before the killing she ate icecream
with Ayers. It would also be shown, he
said, th^t on the evening before the trag
edy Mrs. Bonlne'a manner was not that
of a person with murder In her heart.

ing, the second an hour later and the
third at the hour above-named. The last

570,000, furniture $5000 and on plans, in
struments and ether apparatus of the
Board of Public Works $25,000. The Insur
ance Is $72,000 on the building and $5000 on
the furniture. . ' ,
Charles Stoll, an -employe of the City
Engineer's offlce, was seriously hurt by
the falling roof while he was trying to
save some of- the records of the building.
The building was erected in 1880 at a
cost of $300,000, John D. McGllvray, now of
San Francisco, being the builder.

LOST COAL VEIN
IS REDISCOVERED
Expert Locates Great
Fuel Bed in Cedar i
Mountain. ;:

Special ' Dlepatch to . The . Call.
TA COMA, Nov. 30.â The \ rediscovery of
a mammoth coal vein on Cedar Mountain
Is the latest development in the mineral
resources of Western Washington. Yearg
ago Cedar. Mountain coal was the best
known on the Pacific Coast. â  It was usaJ
almost exclusively because of Its high
quality, its cleanliness,. Its abundance and
Its accessibility to tide water. J. M. Col
man, a Seattle pioneer, was owner of the
property. It was in Cedar Mountain coal
that he laid the foundation of his largo
fortune. .
Suddenly the vein was lost. The Col.
mans worked for months and spent thou
sands of dollars to relocate It, but with
out success,, i The property finally passed
to other hands, and nothing further was
done with it. The last purchasers were
E. L. Grondahl, vice 'president- of the
Scandinavian-American Bank, and J. A.
Moore. They employed 'T. B. Corey, a
mining engineer and coal expert, to make
a rediscovery of the lost vein. If possible.
His calculations and labors have just been
rewarded, for he has relocated and un
covered the long lost vein. It is said to
be the largest body ot clean coal so far
known on the Pacific Coast. The vein
is twelve feet thick and underlies 1M
acres in a solid field at 12,000 tons to the

REDDING, Nov. 30.â One of the m03t
remarkable cyclones recorded in Northern
California occurred last evening in Happy
Valley, ten miles southwest of Redding.
The path of destruction barely missed a
farm house and the striking point of the
hurricane looks' much like the site of a
powder .works after an explosion.
The rain slackened toward dusk and a
single black cloud floated over the valley.
It parted and one section began to revolve
Itself Into a great black funnel, which
presently began to move with great rapid*
ity. The peculiar shrieking sound fright
ened the people at adjacent farm houses.
The. funnel shot toward the house of Rev.
O. W. Burtner, sweeping so close above
It that wooden fruit trays and light lum
ber were drawn up by the suction.
The spiral cyclone touched in the
orchard a hundred yards beyond the
house. The ground was torn up as by a
terrlflc.exploslon and large trees were up
rooted. The cyclone soon spent Itself in
the woods.
acre. It Is computed that there are prac
tically 2,000,000 tons of coat in the vein.
Another vein on the same property, re
cently uncovered, contains 2,000,000 tons
more, making a total of 4,000,000 tons in
sight.
THREAT TO KILL
WOMAN DOCTOR
Lydia Strattoc, M. D., Is
Persecuted by a Col
ored Man.
ShiV Believes Him to Be
Insane and Wants Him
Arrested.
Dr. Lydia Stratton. who has offices !n
the Parrott building, secured warrants
from Judge Mogan yesterday for the ar
rest of Charles Robinson, a colored man,
on charges of disturbing the peace and
threats to kill. She was nervous and ex
cited and shrank from, the publicity that
her action might cause.
She said she first knew Robinson when
he used to call at her office, 2S7 Geary
street, to. see a colored porter, who was
his friend. Since then Robinson has been
: calling at her office repeatedly and In
sisting that she should teach him to be
a physician. If a patient Happened to be
consulting her, Robinson would bounce
Into the room unexpectedly and raise a
disturbance.
She lives at 730 Bush street, and Fri
day night he stood otus.ue the house,
using vulgar and offensive language to
the annoyance of herself and- the neigh
bors. He called her offensive names and
threatened to kill her if she came out
side. She thinks the man must be crazy.
She was compelled to give up her offlce
on Geary street owing to his persecution
and remove to the Parrott building, but
he has kept up his annoying visits there.
He was not jpnly making her suffer pain
and humiliation by his conduct, but wai
Injuring her business, aa most of her pa
tients were ladles, who could not compre
hend the man's extraordinary conduct. â¢

WONDERFUL^ HYOMEi
LUCKY MANUFACTURBRS.
Physicians can now look forward to the
coming winter without any fear or anxiety
regarding the thousands of weak-lunged
and catarrh afflicted patients under their
care". â Â»â¢â â¢. â¢;,.'.-
Facts furnished by the Bureau of Vital
Statistics ln Washington have proven be-"
yond the least shadow of doubt that' con-
sumption Is curable, that all respiratory
diseases can be eradicated completely and
the death rate reduced wonderfully by the
use of the new remedy, HYOMEL
HYOMEI Is a dry air germicide found
In Australia, the, first one ever known
which can be Inhaled in the air - we
breathe, thc only possible method by
which the" germs of these diseases can be
reached.
LUCKY MANUFACTURERS.
Never before in the whole history of
medicine has any remedy manufacteured
for these diseases received recognition by
the United States Health Reports or been
successful in reducing the death rate ono
iota, and it Is expected that all physicians
from this time on will use this one treat-
ment and no other. Of course this means
a tremendous demand for the new germ-
icide and a fortune to tbe manufacturers,
a reward which they richly deserve.
LACK OP SUPPLY FEABED.
Undoubtedly thousands of lives will bÂ«
saved during the coming winter through
the r.ew treatment, but as this germicide
Is only obtained in Australia and at cer-
tain seasons of the year. It is feared the
manufacturers have not a sufficient sup-
ply on hand to meet the Increased de-
mand. - â  â  ' 'â¢ * -' - - *
All of those who . are afflicted with
cough3, catarrh or consumption should,
therefore, obtain an outfit of HYOMEI
from their druggists at once, or send to

WEST POINT CADETS DEFEAT ANNAPOLIS ON THE GRIDIRON
RANK OUTSIDERS CUT WIDE SWATH
IN THE MUDDY GOING AT OAKLAND
EVEN with a card that would not
bear too careful scanning and a
big fog: bank thrown In to boot,
the Saturday crowd at Oakland
track showed no apparent dimin
ution. The track was In muddy condi
tion and rank outsiders In the betting
bucked the line for four touchdowns,
each of which kicked a blgr hole In the
bank rolls of the smart division. Fog;,
thick and Impenetrable, obscured nearly
all view of the last three races.
Always a great favorite with the gen
eral public, but apparently forgotten
during the speculating on the fifth num
ber. Horton. the little red horse, fairly
valued In at odds of 7 to L The supposed
â¢wise money was divided between Sea
Lion and Hungarian, each closing at 8 to
I. Sea Lion made the running, turning
Into the straight for home with Hoar on
Horton at his throatlatch. There was no
outfootlng the latter from there on, for
he gradually forged to the front, winning
by two lengths. Blrkenruth. astride Graf
ter, a 20 to 1 chance, caught the tiring
Sea Lion, securing the place. Hungarian
proved a dismal failure for such a hot
one off the coals.
Always very much In evidence over a
muddy track, Invlctus. a 44 to 1 chance,
â¢with Fauntleroy up. made a runaway
race of the Introductory sprint, winning
by two lengths. Mounce on the favorite.
Searchlight, had to thread his way
through the bunch and was led out for
the place by Mike Rice. Ruli rode the
latter, and the old gelding showed
marked Improvement.
Rollick, from the Burns & Waterhouse
ctable and a 4 to 5 favorite, lasted to
within a few yards of the wire In the
second race, and was then downed a neck
by The Miller, a 10 to 1 shot. "Handrid
lng" Kelly rode the latter, exercising
good Judgment, and made a well-timed
move. Mounce had the leg up on Torslna,
and butÂ» for being cut off twice while try-
Ing to get through In the stretch would
have won. The mare finished a bang-up
third. .
On her recent clever win. George Bald
win's filly Louwelsea. with Bullman In
the saddle, had first call In the betting
on the two-year-old event. She was
prominent to the head of the stretch and
then began falling back. Larry Daly then
went, on with Sir Lewis, a 13 to 1 shot,
beating Halnault five lengths at the wire.
Commissioner Forster dropped along
from the rear, securing show honors.
With his corkscrew legs and all Flo
ronso, an even money favorite, scored his
third win In the slx-furlong spin, fourth
to be decided. Mocnce waited with him
to tbe stretch and then ran over Tlburon
and Mocorito. The last named mare out
stayed Tlburon, taking the place by a
head.
Nearly everything and anything that
started In the closing mile selling affair
â were cuoted at 4 to 1 by the ring, the
most coin perhaps being played on Her
culean. Plohn. Wyoming and Sunello.
Mounce. on Sugden. issued from the fo*
first and in a driving finish won from
â¢Herculean by. half a length. Plohn found
the route too far, but succeeded in get
ting the show.
Track Notes.
Mounce was the only rider to pilot two
wiener*.
Sunello got mixed up In a bumping
xr.atch poon after the start.
Midnight Chimes, which has always
been knocking at the gate, made a poor
showing In the fourth event.
Mike Rice ran a vastly improved race
â¢with Kulz in the saddle. Vittatoe rode
the old peldinsr the previous time out.
Noihir.fr but bad racing luck beat Tor
fina. Mounce was pocketed while trying
to get through at the head of the stretch
tad again below the eighth pole Parsifal
gave the mare a bump that proved fatal
to her chances.
Louwelsea must have been run short.
There was no apparent -reason for the
mare stepping as the did.

hard. They took a lead of two In the
first inning. The produce men tied the
ecore in the second. In the third the
commission men lurched ahead two more

game.
The heavy fos settled down In the sev

the eighth inning they went up to the
plate In droves and hit at every ball they
saw floating around In the fog. When
ever a ball was hit the fog made It good.
The produce men Mad to use foghorns on
the bases and siren whistles out In the
field. Finally Umpire Frank Esola came
in out of the *wet and said the side was
out. and then everybody agreed It wasn't
necessary to play any more and that the
five runs made by the commission Jug

counted.

FOG OBSCURES

Many Trials Are Cub Off
From the View of v
â  '; -Spectators.
A thick fog hung over Union coursing
park field yesterday afternoon. As a re
sult but few complete courses were wlt
nesred by the spectators. The misty
weather, though, rcemed to have an ex
hilarating effect on the hares, for despite
the forced short slips they maintained
their speed and gave their pursuers many
hard, long runs.
The talent had a good day and picked
all but nix of the forty courses correctly.
The pikers came In for* a couple of long
shots. Knvanaugh'n Maybe Kind helped
them to the tune of 10 to 1 In her go with
the Imported courser Representative. The
local dog on leaving the slips ran un
sighted, but when she joined In she put
up a grand exhibition and cleverly out
worked her opponent. .. â¢
Then Fenll, on. whom the talent had put
up 6 to 1, ran a losing course to Fly by
Night. ' . v, [ ,_

QUARTERBACK DALY IS THE HERO OF
A GREAT STRUGGLE FOR HONORS.
y|^k HILADELPHIA, Spv; 30.-Prob-
I Jl ably the most distinguished gath
|r"*^L- erins' that ever witnessed a foot-
JJL .v ball game In this country and ad-
'. , : ; mlttedly the greatest crowd that
ever entered the. sates of Franklin field
saw West Point defeat Annapolis this af
ternoon by a score of- 11 to 6. From the
moment that President Roosevelt and his
pa<rty entered the great amphitheater un
til, half an hour after the timekeeper had
blown his whistle announcing the cessa
tion" of hostilities there was a continuous
uproa^r, such as. probably never has
taken place on any football field In the
country. â '-â â  .\1 /;. :'â¢'' : -â â  '_ â 
, Even the President and several, mem
bers of his Cabinet, worked up to a ner
vous pitch by the excitement, left their
seats in the .private box which had been
set apart- for their occupation and took
positions on the side-line benches, which
are usually used for substitute players
and coaches, j The President's appearance
was the signal for a tremendous outburst
of applause, which continued until he had
walked down the center of the gridiron
and across the field to his seat In the
north stand. The President's silk hat was
on his head scarcely five seconds from the
time he entered the grounds until he had
taken his seat, so continuous was the ova
tion. .. . . i . -â  â ..--.> .,-â .: v- â¢ .
Hardly had the President and party
taken the!r seats before the navy team
came upon the field from the weit en
trance. The followers of the Annapolis
cloven made the stands shake with their
choers, and blue and oranse flags seemed
to be floating from all sections of the
field. Six minutes later the* West Point
lads trotted out, and then the black.
orange and gray of the army was waved
deliriously from the big south stand. No
time was consumed in formalities. The
coin was tossed and Captain Nichols of
the navy called the turn correctly. He
chose the west goal, with a slight advan
tage of the wind, and at 2:15 Graves had
kicked off. -
From the moment the ball was put In
play until the timekeeper's rwhlstle blew
there . was no more Interested spectator
of the game than President Roosevelt.
The contest had been In progress less
than ten minutes when he left his seat In
the 4>r!vate box and took his position on
the side line bench. When Casad broke
through the navy's line and ran 66 yards
the President jumped to his feet excited
ly and advanced toward the gridiron, but
returned to . his { seat a moment later
when the ball was put In play again. At
the end of the first half Secretary Root
and General Miles came across the field
to escort the President to the army's

President Roosevelt walked across to the
south stand and again occupied a' seat
on the side line. When the two teams
resumed play at 3:23 and Daly of the
army team made his great run of 103
yards for a touchdown" President Roose
velt Jumped to his feet with an expres
sion of surprise on his face, and, like
thousands of others, could. scarcely real
ize what a remarkable piece of football
mechanism Daly really ls and that he
could make such a phenomenal run
through an entire field.
Annapolis won the toss and chose the
west goal, giving West Point the ball.
Graves kicked to Nichols, who was
thrown on the navy's 29-yard line. An
napolis then carried the ball to their 42
yard line, where the army line held and
Belknap was forced to kick. Daly caught
the. ball for West Point on the tatter's 30
yard line. West Point could make but
little impression on the navy line and
Daly was forced to kick, the ball going
to Annapolis on her own 30-yard line.
After carrying It back to West Point's
45-yard line the navy boys lost the ball
on holding and West Point immediately
punted to the navy's 35-yard line. The
navy punted to West Point's 25-yard line
and Daly carried the ball back to mld
fleld before being downed. The army lads
carried the ball to the navy's 28-yard line,
where they lost it on downs. The navy
sent the ball out of danger, the ball going
to West Point's 30-yard Mne. On the first
line-up Casad of West Point broke
through the navy line and carried the ball
to the navy's 25-yard line. Hackett. f
Bucker and Casad carried the ball ten
yards nearer the Annapolis goal. It was
the third down, with three yards to gain,
and Daly dropped back for a try at %
field goal. The ball sailed squarely be*
tween the posts and the West Point root
ers cheered heartily for their eleven.
There was an exchange of kicks and
then McNair, the Annapolis quarterback,
ran sixty yards, placing the ball on West
Point's 26-yard line. Plunges into the line
by Freyer, Read and Nichols forced the
ball over West Point's goal line, Nichols
making the touchdown. Belknap missed
the goal and the score was tied at 5. There
was no further scoring In this half, time
being called with the ball In the army's
possession in the mldfleld.
The sensational play of the game was
made Immediately after the kick-off In
the second half. Belknap kicked to Daly
and the latter, catching the ball on West
Point's 5-yard line, ran the entire length
of the field for a touchdown. He was as
sisted greatly by the splendid Interference
of Bunker and Casad. Daly kicked tbm
goal and the score was:
West Point 11, AnnapoHs 5.
Belknap was forced to retire, and An
napollf was badly handicapped by the
weak kicking of Freyer. West Point
gained from ten to twenty yards on each
exchange. Near the close of the gama
Freyer's fumble gave the army eleven
the ball on the navy's 13-yard line. It
was carried to the 7-yard line, where it
was lost on downs. On the first line-up
Freyer got through the West Point line
and carried the ball to midfleld. Annapois
then forced the pigskin to West Point's
35-yard line, only to losw it on downs.
Daly kicked it out of danger. This pro
ceeding was repeated several times, tha
navy boys gaining double the amount ot
ground gained by their heavier opponents.NEWS OF THE BAY CITIES

"A man who would marry a mere school
girl and then desert her and her child
has no right to live," exclaimed Mrs. E.
J. Jerome, this morning In Judge Hall's
court while on the witness stand, testify
ing In behalf of her daughter, Mrs. Caro
line Davles, who was seeking, a divorce
from William Davles, an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company. ' â  Â«
Mrs. Jerome said that Davles married
her daughter six years ago. \ He was a
good husband for awhile, she said, but
after the baby . was born he began to
exhibit his S temper on occasions. Little
things made him angry and he did not
hesitate- to . chastise . his schoolgirl wife
with the palm of his hand and even some
times to attack his mother-in-law.' Final
ly the young husband left Jils wife to
get along the best she could, refusing to
share any of his stipend with his wife
and child. ' ..':-, : . ,
In her own behalf Mrs. Davies corrob
orated her mother' n testimony and said
that she thought If she had $16 a month
she could, with her mother's assistance,
care for herself and child. Judge Hall
ascertained that her 'husband was getting
$45 a month at his work and besides grant
ing her the divorce and the child's cus
tody ordered Davies to payi$15 on the first
of every month. ; , .

ALAMEDA, Nov. 30.â In the heavy fog
which enveloped the city this evening and
retarded local traffic, the through ' train
from San Jose crashed Into the rear end
of a local train on the narrow gauge at
Webster-street station at 5:30 o'clock.
The San Jose train was moving slowly
at the time, otherwise there might have
been a serious accident and perhaps loss
of life. As It was the rear platform of
the last car on the local train, which was
at a standstill, was. mucked and the car
considerably damaged. There were but
a few persons in the car when the col
lision occurred, as the travel on the local
train going toward the pier at that time
Is always very light.
The San Jose train had followed tho
local train from Park-street station. Be
cause of the dense fog a sharp lookout
was kept by the engineer and fireman,' as
tho trains were never more than a few
hundred yards apart. When the local
stopped at "Webster-street the San Jose
through train was near Enclnal station.'
There Is a heavy downward grade from
Enclnal station to Webster-street station
and the rails being wet and slippery the
brakes on the Ban Jose train did not
operate quickly enough to prevent It from
striking the last car on the local train.
There was but little delay caused by the
collision and both trains proceeded to the
pier. ' 'â  . â¢ ' - - . .-Â»

Is Pleasant News to the Musical Set
OAKLAND. Nov. 3O.-The an
nouncement of the engagement of
Miss Grace Carroll of this city
and F. N. Elliott of San Fran
clsco has caused quite a ripple of
interest not only In society, but in the
musical world. Miss Carroll is one of the
best-known singers on either side of the
bay. being possessed of a rich contralto
voice of rare depth and quality and hav
ing been a soloist In several choirs both
here and in San Francisco. It is only
a few months since Miss Carroll returned
from a prolonged sojourn In New York,
where she studied voice culture with a
noted Instructor. Miss Carroll comes of
a musical family, her sister being- the
well-known soprano, Mrs. Carroll-Nlchol
son. Miss Mae Carroll, a clever pianist
of Sacramento, Is also a relative. ; -
Mr. Elliott is a business man of San

John J. Hollywood, a member of Com
pany D. Eleventh United States Infantry,
in the Philippines, has written to Andrew
J. Hollywood, deputy customs collector
in this city, concerning conditions in the
islands as bearing upon the installation
of American schoolteachers there. . Hla
letter is as follows: ! ;, . v : ;
"I have learned that there are quite a
number of American - schoolteachers
coming to tho Philippines to teach the
natives the American idea of things In
general. I think that they are a little
'previous,' to use a slang phrase; that Is,
I do not think that affairs are settled
sufficiently for the purpose for which
they are coming over .here. Conditions
are such and will -be so for some 'time to
como that It Is really a great hardship
for an American woman to live at all in
a great number of towns any distance
removed from Manila, as. for Instance.
Carigara and other towns on this island
(Leyte), which are all some 600 miles
from Manila, which is the distributing
depot for any and all of the comforts ob
tainable over here. '
"So you see the farther you are away
from It. the less you are able to obtain
of those things which go to make life at
least endurable. They will for a tlma
have to subsist upon such articles as the
post commissary, can furnish them,- and
live In a *'nlpa' shack until time and the
civil authorities better their condition."

Failure of Electricity Causes Students

-by Candle' Light,
BERKELEY, Nov. 30.â The students at
the junior promenade, held in Harmon
gymnasium, danced the closing numbers
by candle light In the early hours this
morning, all on account of & sudden leak
age in a boiler In tho Mechanics building
on tho university j grounds. This leakage
stopped the generation of electricity for
tho lights in the gymnasium and darkness
reigned until candles were produced.
The musicians had a few candles with
them, evidently having had previous ex
perience? in that Hno, and these were
placed at wide intervals about the big
building.' j Dancing was then resumed and
the' programme completed. â  The lights
were dim during most of the dances, but
faint candle light was more .than most. of
them bargained* for. '\ They proved, how
ever, ' to be equal to the emergency, for
none left the last numbers undanced.
Owing to the darkness In the dressing
rooms, considerable difficulty .was .expe

PRANK OF A LAD
ENDS IN DEATH
Berkeley^ Boy * Shoots
Himself" While Play;
Ing With Chum. ' *
Two Men Near Scene of AccI*
dent Refuse to Render
'&?KÂ£.: Aid.
BERKELEY, Nov. 30.â Harry Fortier.
a 16-year-old boy whose home was at 2015
Bancroft way, accidentally shot himself
In the leg this morning, while hunting on
the Berkeley hills, dying a few hour*
later from loss of blood and shock. Al
though - conscious until within twenty
minutes of his death the only intelligible
statement was, "Scott didn't do it," made
to exonerate; his companion, Scott Mills,
from all blame. * . :f '-â '..
The shooting was the result of careless
playfulness on the part of the boys.
When near the upper reservoir on the
bills they commenced good natured scuf
fling and as Mills started to climb a fence
young Fortier poked him with the butt
of his shotgun. In some manner the shell
was exploded and the entire charge of
shot passed through the inside of For
tier's left thigh Just below the groin,.
tearing out a bole an inch In diameter
and breaking the femoral artery. Mills
ran to the house of Bruno Cordo, 'the
keeper of the reservoir, for assistance
and Mrs. Cordo came to the side or the
injured, lad, but could do nothing for
him. â¢ .
Two cruelly- indifferent men working in
a field near by refused their aid. declar
ing that they were not able to leave their
work. Mills did not know the men and
his appeals for help were without avail.
As he turned back to his wounded com
rade. Charles Sleeper, a boy of IS. reached
the spot and taking Mrs. Cordo's cart
drove to this city, a distance of two miles,
for help. ,
Sleeper got L. M. Hale, Fortler's broth
er-in-law, who, with Fred Foss, secured
a wagon and drove to the scene of the
shooting. The boy was then taken to Dr.
H. N. Ro well's office, where he was at
tended. The accident occurred at about
8 o'clock and it was over two hours' later
before young Fortier got medical attend
ance. He had virtually bled to death be
fore he reached Dr. Rowell's office and
he rapidly sank until at 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon the end came.
The Mills boy Is only 14 years of age
and was badly frightened by the catas
trophe. As his back was turned to For
tier he did not see the shot and is unable
to explain how the shell was exploded. He
felt Fortier strike him with the butt of
his gun and an instant later the shot
came and Fortier fell screaming to the
ground. â¢ . . ' : - ; .-
S. M. Fortier, father of the dead lad, Is
in the Government employ at the navy
yard in Vallejo. He was summoned by
telegraph, but did not arrive until twen
ty minutes after his son had passed
away. The members of the family are
prostrated over the accident. \ 'â .
Deputy Coroner J. E. Strelghtif took
charge of the case and removed the body
to the family residence at the request of
the parents. An Inquest will be held.

JUDGE DECIDES
AGAINST FUREY
Holds Special Officer
*\ -\ for Assault to
S 'Murder. "~ " â  " l
The preliminary examination of Edward
Fursy on the charge of assault to murder
was concluded before Judge Conlan yes
terday. Furey was held to answer before
the Superior Court in $500 bonds. Attor
ney W. W. Foote conducted the prosecu
tion on behalf of the Marine Firemen's
Union and the defendant was represented
by Attorney Joseph F. Coffcy.
Furey, during the strike, was employed
as a special officer at the Risdon Iron
Works, and on August 21, while he was In
charge of some men employed repairing
the steamer Alameda at the Oceanic dock,
he accompanied one of the men to a res
taurant on East street. Several strikers
began abusing Furey's companion, calling
him d "scab" and other offensive names,
and made a threatening demonstration. '
Furey^ stepped i forward to protect the
man and was attacked by the strikers,
one of whom, Peter Callahan, a marine
fireman, grappled with him. Fure>
slipped and fell with Callahan on top of
him. Furey's revolver: fell out of his
pocket and both made f> grab for it, but
Furey was quicker than Callahan, and
seeing his' danger he ..truck Callahnn on
the head with the butt end of his revol
ver. The revolver was discharged at tho
same time and the bullet went through
Callahan's Jaws.
Callahan and Furey practically told the
same story of the occurrence, but five
witnesses for the prosecution, who were
all strikers, contradicted. them by swear-
Ing ihat Furey drew his revolver and
pointed It at Callahan, who struck Furey's
hand upward. Then they grappled and,
Furey shot Ca'llahan. It was on this tes
timony that the Judge held Furey to an
swer. . 'â  ';.'}'â  /" : v â¢ ' r
During the strike Furey was shot at
more than once by strikers, and there is
a case now pending In the Supcrlox Court
against a striker named Carlson, who was
arrested for attempting to murder him. .

Mayor Believes God
chaux Innocent of
Grave Charges.
Official Says He Did Not
Receive Money Prom
Copyists.
Recorder Godchaux was In conference
yesterday with Mayor Phelan regarding
the charges made by" two discharged
copyists, Frank Urmy and Mark Bartlett,
that they had lost their positions because
they had refused to contTlhute HO. to God
chaux' campaign fund. The Mayor de
sired to ascertain If Godchaux ' had vio
lated the charter by accepting money
from his subordinates. Godchaux proved
conclusively that he had personally not
received money .for such, a purpose. He
filed the ; following communication with
the Mayor defending his position:
Mayor James D. Phelanâ Dear Sir: Replylns
to your letter of November 27.-.J90J..I deny the
right of th<Â» Civil Service Commission to Â»n
temre In the management of my olnce. The
Supreme Court has decided, that. I am not sub
ject to civil service. In refusing to abide by
this decision the commission, forced my office
Into the Superior Court, where Judge Beawell
decided, as had the Supreme Court, that my
office was not civil service. I feel, therefore.
Justified In accepting the law of my office from
the highest courts In ; the State rather than
Irom any commission, v â  .
i Pausing to the subject of the affidavits I
never asked any person In my office to contri
bute a cent to anything whatever, or suggest
>ed that any pernon In my office should coir.rib
ute anything whatever. Whether the sum of
$2 CO was by any of the deputies or copyists
In my. office requested of either Urmy or Bart
lett to .help pay the salary of a messenger for
one month, I do, not know.
. TKe Officers' Charity -Fund.
*The charity fund of a dollar a month was
a voluntary arrangement made by the em
plo)es. 1 was asked If I would contribfite
to the fund and did bo substantially. In-re
gard to contributions, of deputies of my /Cam
paign, that. If done at all, was a matter of
voluntary association among themselves. I
never spoke to an employe or authorised .any
one to speak to an employe â¢ on â¢ the subject.
The statements about Mr. Schiller and Mr.
Hayes are absolutely untrue. These men have
earned every cent they have received, as the
records of my office clearly prove.
Â» About the payment of a fee to an attorney
In the second civil service suit: At that time
the Supreme Court had decided that roy office
was not civil service. The Civil Service Com
mission refused to. accept the decision of the
Supreme Court as law, and' was narrating
and .disturbing my office- Some of the .em
ployes made arrangements' to have the matter
further litigated, to the expense* of which I
contributed; but I never asked -any employe
to contribute and never Instructed or author
ized anybody to do so. Any statement to tho
contrary Is wholly false.
I discharged Mr. Uartlett because he wrote
me an Insulting letter. I discharged Mr
Urmy for Insubordination. Very truly yours.'
EDMOXD GODCHAUX. County Recorderâ¢'
Godchaux agreed to forbid the collec
tion of money for a charitable fund in
his office, and the Mayor sums up 'the
case In the followlnar findings:
I Findings of the Mayor. â 
I do not want to anticipate the action of the
Civil f Service Commissioners If they have
Jurisdiction, even by suggestion, as to tho
restoration of the discharged employes, but I
find that Recorder Godchaux has received no
money or other thing of value from his em
ployes, and that therefore he has not violated
the provisions of the charter, which forbids
any officer to accept any "donation or gratuity.
In money or other valuable thing, either direct
ly or Indirectly, from any subordinate or em
ploye."
There it nothing In the charter to prevent
city employes from voluntarily contributing a
part.of their salary, for. charity ox t legal < ex
pense*.' It Is the element of duress that thÂ«
charter seeks to eliminate. Mr. Godchnux
shows that he -was not personally the hÂ«ne
ficlary or recipient of any^ money, and that If
money , was raised and expended for specified
purposes by the employes and disbursed by
them for such purposes, all he can do now Is
to advise that- hereafter not even a fund for
charity be raised, and that each employe act
for himself In such matters and on his own
responsibility.
I find that the chief copyist has not been
compensated In a regular way. He has been
paid cut of the earnings or the offlce by credit
ing him with folios. I have recommended tu
the Board of Supervisors to nuthorlze the em
ployment of a chief copyist and pay him the
fcalaxy of UCO per month, which he now re
ceives, out of the 123,000 appropriated in the
budget for the services of copyists. This will
not Increase the number of men nor Increase
the cost of the oOln*. but simply make the em
ployment and compensation regular. â  ,,

ber aUout twenty-fire were on the tll

comfortable as possible.
Ail told their stories of the collision.
Bone pained the deck of the Sausalito
before the San Rafael commenced to
eir.k and watched tne work of rescue.
Others remained on the sinking ship and
â we:;t into the water. Most of the' lafat
xaer.tior.ed think that lives were lost,
'iiiey base this statement on the difficulty
they experienced in getting saved. Cap
tain W. T. Tribble of the Sausalito said:
"We struck the San Rafael a little for
ward of the starboard wheel, impaling
her in our bow. I rushed Xrom the pilot
hoL^se to the clock first to ascertain the
extent of the injury done to the vessel
ar.d then to .iirect the saving of life, if

I stood I cou'.d :=ee that she was badly
stove in and tilling with water. My ln
ter.tion was t<> keep her close so that we
might take olt as many of her passengers
its we could without the use of boat*. I
â¢greeted my crew, and they worked with
fost disorder and in perfect harmony. Our
life preservers were taken down and
throv.n both on the deck of the sinking
vessel and into the water, where people
â¢were "truggling. ,In addition we lowered
two boats and picked up those who were

there was no one drowned. The San Ra

V k "hen asked where he believed the
blame should bÂ« placed the captain re
plied. "For God's sake, don't ask n?e."
Some thrilling experiences were related
by the survivors. They told of how they
escaped a watery prave and then of their
work of rescue. In glowing words they
complimented the work of the crews as
well as the general bohavior of the pas
sengers in the moment of peril.
From what can be learned at this point
a waiter named George Treadway of the
Ban Rafael was drowned. Treadway was
pinioned by the splintering timbers when
the Sausalito struck and after some diffi
culty was extricated. He was hurried to
the upper deck of the injured vessel and
that was the last seen of him. according
to the survivors. Treadway has a wife
and child residing here. A deckhand, a
Portuguese, is also said to be lost.
Ills name is not known. Those of the
crew of the sunken chip who arrived here
Fay they did not see him on board the
Sansalito. He started to lower the boats
ok- r the collision and no trace of him has
tX found since then.
Trank Hawton, a cook on the San Ra
fael, attempted to return to the boat res
taurant in an effort to secure the cash.
Captain McKenrle, learning of his inten
tion, stopped him". Hawton persisted and
had to be dragged on board the Sausalito.
Had he returned to the dining-room he
would have been drowned.'
Peter U. ICagle Jr.. an attorney whose
home is In Sausalito. was thrown from
tho deck of tbe San Rafael by the force
of tho collision. He nwam about In the
water for some time and succeeded in
rescuing a woman who fell near him.
Kagte assisted in placing the woman over
tbe eidc of a small boat and finding no
room on board for him swam off again.
Charkji Bagge, first mate of the Sausalito,
finally threw the attorney a rope and got
him aboard.

FATED SAN RAFAEL AND
CREW THAT MANNED HER
THE San Rafael was built in New York and sent across the continent in pieces; Each com
ponent part was carefully shipped in boxes and bundles and upon arriving on this coast in
1877 the steamer, was 'put together over at Steamboat Point, where the Union Iron Works
now stand. Captain McKenzie has been master of the ill-fated steamer since the day she made her
first trial trip. The San- Rafael was 205 feet long and had a $2- foot beam and a p-foot depth of
hold.
The crew of the steamer when she went down was as follows: J. T. McKcnzic, % captain ;
Charles- Johnson, first mate; C. H. Jansen, second mate; James H. Jones, chief engineer; John
Campbell, assistant chief engineer; John Clarke, fireman; Fred Peterson, watchman; Paul Zara,
John Nelson, A.' Swanson and J. Silva, deckhands; John liller, porter. , â¢

dren. Women shouted franti
cally and men cursed. It was a
fight for life, each one for him
self. . Incidents of- bravery there
were, but they are locked up in
the breasts of- those who partici
pated in them. The darkness and
the dense, murky. fog made .each
man's fighc his own. - . i
PANIC SEIZES CROWD. ?
In the cabin the crowd congre
gated, or down in^the warm sa
loon men played cards or drank
their cocktails. â¢ Even before the
San Rafael pulled out of the slip
there were few of the 250 passen
gers who were not timorous
about the trip across 'the bay.
Waiting minute by minute many
of the women had their nerves
at the highest pitch before the ac
cident occurred. Men less fear
ful of prospective evil walked the
upper deck straining their eyes
for ships that pass in the night.
When the crash came \he'. vision
of possible sudden death held all
in a vise-like grip. ' Action came
after the recoil.
I When the San Rafael keeled
over to the port side from the
effect of the shocjc the cabin pas
sengers lost control, of them
selves. Windows were smashed,
and instead of reaching the deck
by means of trie ordinary -door
exits they tore their hands and
faces climbing through the'-djftn
ings of shattered glass; Then
came the confusion in the search
forJife-preservers. The % San>Riu

But they soon found out. Only
an eye-witness can picture in his
mind the wild, chaotic fear mani
fested by that seething, surging
crowd, pushing, trampling, fight
ing in the fullness of their terror.
ORDER TO MAN BOATS.
Orders to man boats were
given by Captain McKenzie of
the San Rafael as soon as he 'â¢eal
ized the full meaning of the col-/
lision. One crdwd - of i twelve
jumped into a lifeboat, and were
lowered, but'soon after swamped.
They -..clung to the gunwales of
the small boat and were rescued.
There, were men and women in
this lot and all were saved. One
mother, in her excitement, fas
tened a life-preserver around her
child, a little boy, and then threw
him into the .-water. He was
saved;. But these means of es
cape were taken , only' by those
who suffered a great confusion of
mind; . To the more collected,
after <the first panic,", the easiest
road ,to safety was- to jump from
one boat to another. By far the
greater majority escaped this
way. u . _^\- .. . /; .;.' â .â ,â¢; \ *Y.,,- r
/Then the Sausalito iowered her
boats and began picking man,
woman and child from impro
vised rafts, boats , and ropes that
were let down from the unin
jured ferryrbbat. vMen, clung a, to
these , ropes until; nothing, but
their grit was left of them. Bodies
well nigh, frozen from , the jciness
of the water/ and hands stiffened
and cramped, they held on until
grim despair gave way to the
Tush of joy at being saved..
THE RESCUED REJOICE.
Many there were last night
ebullient with joy at being res
cued from a watery grave, that
told of the horror of the scene*
The piteous cry of the women
and the children still rang in their
ears, and they feared that many
more were lost than was at first
supposed. . .
Â»â¢ While floating on their life
preservers \V. , L. Beecly,. Miss
Fannie Shoobert and Mrs. Olfve
Hamilton, of Sausalito.- picked
up a little boy. He was floating
on a bench. All were saved.
PASSING BOAT GIVES NO AID. .
The San Rafael sank, slowly.'
While the cries of the affrighted
were mingled with the throaty
turmoil of the foghorns, a boat
passed near the scene of the ac
cident. Immediately a shout of
distress went up. Men on the
passing boat answered the cries
of the distressed, but no help was
given. Soon after, the San Ra
fael disappeared with a fierce suc
tion. Then all was calm and quiet
save the piercing fog whistle. ,

draughts. The man who hiftl
no friend aboard and who came
off unscathed was a happy ma,n
indeed. . ~
The ne\yjv of the disaster trav
eled â¢ quickly. When the Sausa
lito entered her slip on her return
trip the employes at- the dock
scented the calamity. Hardly had
the boat made. /fast when the
crowd surged forward. Dripping
men, terror-stricken wSmen and
children, excited almost to. deli
rium, rushed over the. gangplank
in great confusion. Telephones
were in demand by tlje thought
ful ones. Through the town th&
news was disseminated and with
in an hour the crowds around the
bulletin-boards read the awful
story. What San Francisco had
been fearing for years, had, at last
come to pass.

Consul General to New Zealand,
a Passenger on the Sausalito.
J. D. Connolly, j ex-Consul General' to
New. Zealand, was among the passengers
on tho Bausalitoat the time. she. collided
with the San Rafael. .He made the fol
lowing,, statement.' of :the affair: â 
"I was In the upper cabin reading a
paper when I heard the crashing of tim
ber. The boat lurched to ono side and
came almost to a -halt. .There was great
excitement among the passengers. The
women . screamed , and j a , rush was made
for the deck. 1 The fog was intense, but
before us loomed up n large fabric which
I made out to be a steamer. Our bow
was .Imbedded In the steamer's side, and
I then realized that we were in collision.
There was great excitement. It was then
Just 6:20 o'clock. - Captain McKenzle was
Issuing orders and ropes were secured,
with which the two boats-were; fastened
together. I saw people in the cabin of
the 8an Rafael trying .<â  to get out by
breaking the windows. Several 'â¢ passen
gers ' appeared on the wheel framework
of the San Rafael and were assisted to
the' deck of the Sausalito by the passen
gers. We threw life preservers over-,
board to those we saw^ struggling* In the
water. I saw at' least a dozen people . In
the water. \_ : . .'â .â¢'â .'' â '' â 'â¢ 'â

STATES THAT MAN
LOST HIS LIFE IN
THE DINING-ROOM
the crash occurred. I heard the whistle
blow at intervals, but did not realise the
danger until the collision took place. I
think some fifty or more people were as
sisted to the Sausalito from tho San
Rafael.' I am not certain as to the num
ber, however. I am positive that there
were women and children In the cabin
of th-s San Rafael when she went down.
This was about twenty" minutes after the
accident. There did not seem to be much
discipline displayed by the officers of the
San Rafael. The work was done by the
passengers rather than by the crew of
that beat. After the San Rafael went
down we drifted about aimlessly, and
about an hour later we were told by n
tugboat captain that we were near Fort
Point. This gave. Captain JJcKcnzie our
bearings and we got into the slip at 9:Â«
o'clock. ...
"I have no .- means "of knowing how
many lives were, lost, but -the ' number
must be t considerable. I saw a number
of people, struggling iii the water and am

themselves very creditably." That r they

â¢ one of the narrow

one aboard the San Rafael, and yet there
was perhaps nobody on the Ill-fated
steamer who after the collision performed
more heroic services than he. Boyd's
thrilling story bodes 111 to the hope that
there were no fatalities resulting from
the accident. Boyd. who Is to-day laid up
In bed from Injuries received trying: to
aid others, believes that a man named
J. Hartwell was either, killed In the res

rammed through tho San Rafael.' or so
badly! injured that: he was unable to es
cape and was carried to the bottom of
the bay with the steamer when she- went
down. Boyd last saw Hartwell when they
all made a mad rush out of the way of
the breaking timbers In the. restaurant.
Hartwell was pinned under a falling tim

When Boyd and his companions succeed
ed In getting on the upper deck of the
steamer they did not stop to consider
their own injuries.- The brave telegraph
operator was. severely cut about the lipj
and he was limping from a brul3ed side,
.but he. set about at once to lend bis aid
In the task of succoring the helpless wom
en and children. About the first person
Boyd saw In dire distress was a Mrs. Wal
ler of Boss Station. The unfortunato
woman was rushing around the upper
deck of the San Rafael with two helpless
children holding tightly to her dress. One
of the children was a boy about 4 years
old. and the other a girl, slightly older.
Boyd grabbed the two children and call
ing aloud. to Mrs. Waller, told her to fol
low him. . -. Â» â¢ . .
The operator led the way to the side of
the deck where, the Sausallto's passen
gers were casting lines to unfortunates
aboard the San Rafael. . On the . way .to
safety. Mrs. 'Waller became frantic and
hysterical and snatched the boy out of
Boyd's arms. A moment later she dis
appeared from view and Boyd clambered
over the side of the Sausalito with the
other child safely folded ' away ' In his
arms. Later Mrs. Waller. In trying to
get aboard the Sausalito, fell over the
side with her* boy In her arms. She was
in the water quite a time, and when they
finally pulled her out. she began walling
and moaning over the disappearance oÂ£
her "sob.* â¢ *â¢'.-,- â¢ . â¢

of the woman and swam about with the
child in his arms.* There was no boat near
nor dangling rope In sight and, becoming
exhausted, the swimmer placed his little
burden on a bench that was floating near
by and swam back to the sinking ship.
Mr. Boyd's sister was a passenger on the
Sausalito on the trip to the city,- but
after the accident she turned around and
went back to her home In San Rafael to

his right ear almost torn from his head
and sustained Internal Injuries which may
prove very serious. He la at present In

He relates his experiences as follows:
I was sitting- at the head of the table in the
ladles' department of the restaurant. There
were three other passengers at the table. When
the crash came 1 was sent spinning across thu
place. I found myself In a corner with my
arm broken and my ear hanging down the side
of my face. When 1 recovered from the shock
1 realised that Â«om*tblnc serious had hap
pened and that tho boat was poir.ff to sink. I
managed to make my way on deck, where I
found every thing* in- confusion and everybody
struggling to gat Inside of life-preservers. I

Kiss Annie Lewis Charges That
Terry Crew Lost Their Heads
When Fatal Clash Came. â â¢
Miss Annie Lewis was on her way to Â»a n
Rafael. In discurelng the disaster sho
said: .
"After paying a visit to my aunt In
San Francisco I had to make a great rush
to get the 6:1a boat. When I got down
there, there was no sign of the gate
opening and I wondered what was the
matter. I asked the ticket agent and
he said the fog was delaying ail the
boats. Finally at 6:20 we got away from
the slip and when we were off Lombard
street wharf, as it appeared to me, there
came a crash. Nobody knew where we
were. I got out on deck and found that
the Sausalito and our boat were In colli
sion. The San Rafael had a big hole stove
in her side and was going down. Every
body w^ rushing for the Sausalito while
all har.os were trying to get the boats
over. The crew seemed to have lost their
heads and while life buoys were thrown
over by the dozen, the lifeboats were not
put in the water until the last minute.
"The deckhands seemed to be sleepy
and moved around as if there was noth
ing at all the matter, while in fact the
ship was cut to the water's edge and as
far as I could sse the firemen had to rush
from the engine rocin to save their lives.
I got one of the life buoys, but luckily I
didn't have to go overboard. After getting
on board the Sausalito everything possible
was done for us. And I don't think that
many lives were lost.
â¢"While I was getting my things together
and trying to save them, a woman and
a baby came along and the baby was cry-
Ing and evidently wanted its mother to
attend to It. I offered to take the baby
and help the mother out. but she wouldn't
allow me to do so. The next thing I knew
was that the mother and baby were try-
Ing to scramble up a plank that had been
placed between the Sausalito and the San
itafiH. and they suddenly disappeared.
TThether they fell between the two boats
and were lost I don't know, but I walked
all over the upper and lower deck of the
fjausallto and could find no trace of them.
I saw Jim McCue thrown against one of
the posts and when he got up the blood
was pouring from his head, but just the
name be started in to help people from
the sinking San Rafael to the Saus>allto.
We were right in the fair way and both
steamers were rolling heavily. The next
lurch threw McCue and a lady he was
helping against the side of the vessel and
then he had to be helped aboard the Sau
sallto because his arm was broken and
he had received a number of other in
juries. After quite an exciting time I got
aboard the Sausalito and finally got back
to San Francisco. As you can see. I am
still wearing the life belt they threw out
on the deck when the collision occurred.
W> had a very lucky escape, but I don't
think many lives were lost."
SCENES OF TEBBOR
ATTEND COLLISION
IN THE HEAVY FOG
Tor a Time Pandemonium Reigned
and Efforts to Save People in
Water Were Nearly Wasted.
M. A. Jackson tells the following story
of tlie disaster.
"I had been up town and Intended to
catch the 5:45 boat. Instead of that I pot
the 6:15. much to my sorrow. We were
tÂ»etween Lombard -street wharf and Alca
traz Island when the reverse bell came,
and I among others went out on dc/*k.
We couldn't see the ship's length and
wondered what was the matter. In some
direction we could hear bells ringing and
knew the sound came from English ships
rn the stream, and then we heard two
whistles and thought It was the Tiburon
making for San Francisco. Then we
hoard twa blast* from our whistle and
two blasts again, and the 8an Rafael
stopped and began to go astrrn. Then we
began to wonder what was the matter,
and before we could come to our sens?*
something came along and struck us and
knocked us over till we didn't know what
v.a* tho matter.
"The next thing I knew was that our
rhJp began to settle. I made no hurry,
because I thought that the upper works
would keep her afloat, and that while the
bottom might drop out of her we still
would have time enough to get aboard
any boat that came to our assistance. I
den't think many people were drowned,
because when I got on deck there were
four lifeboats out and lifebuoy* floating
around enough for a man to walk on.
They had made an Improvised gangway
between the San Rafael and the Sausalito,
and while there was considerable confu
tion, I believe few lives were lost.
"As far as the accident Is concerned, it
Is one of those unavoidable things that is
bound to corae up once in a lifetime. Cali
fornia has never. In my experience, seen
such a heavy fog as prevailed during this

I shall never et e another like it."
Charles Bagge. chief officer of the San
Rafael, said:
"The collision came like a thunderbolt
out of a clear sky, even if it was a foggy
night. I was on the starboard quarter
and keeping a lookout on my own ac
count. I heard one whistle but could not
see anything. Then I heard one whls^e
again. Then the next thing I heard was
the old man give two bells: then our ship
began to slow up; then there were two
bells more and she began to go astern;
then I knew there was trouble. The next
minute before I could turn on my heel
there was a smash. The Sausalito had
struck us forward of the pilot house. We
heeled over until the starboard paddle
box -was clean out of the water and I
thought we were going down. There were
cries from stem to stern of the ship and
for a while pandemonium reigned."
Frank Hyams, foreman of J. H. Keefe,
painter, said: .
"We were about fifteen minutes out
from the slip when the San Rafael dash
ed into us. It was about 6:30. I was sit
ting in the saloon playing cards. The Bau
salito struck and broke right through the
restaurant. I should judge there were
about 250 people aboard. The crowd was
greater than the ordinary Saturday night
crowd. The crash was great. The panic
that followed was awful to hear. I saved
a friend by the name of Leonard, a law
yer of the firm of Leonard & Hawkins. I
pulled him out of the water."
Charles E. Wendt. foreman of Samp
son & Flsger. sallmakers, tells the follow
ing story:

CAPTAIN M'KENZIE OJF THE SAN RAFAEL,
THINKS ALL PASSENGERS WE RE SAVED
CAPTAIN J. T. McKENZIE, master of the sunken steamer San Rafael, is perhaps the most reliable authority on just how the accident occurred and the details of
the exciting scenes that followed subsequently. His statement of 'the affair is as follows : / ; X
"I was in the pilot-house when the Sausalito ran us down and zvas the last man to leave the steamer prior to her going down. We left our slip about 6:20
o'clock and backed out into the bay. I made my usual round turn rather slowly and cautiously, as there were several craft picking their way up and down the bay as I
came out. ,-â â - '. -â ;â . â  â  â  'â â¢â¢â "''.'â¢' - â  - â¢';..-â  V^*'"' 'â â â  'â ?.? â ...'â ."â -'. . ;: -'v â .<â¢-â  'â¢"â¢'- â 'â 'â â 'â â  .â¢ ' V. : ..*- .- ' .- :^ ':'â 'â  â '/â â :â . '. v â 
"After turning around I shaped my course for.Alcatras. The fog was the thickest that I have seen on- the bay for many years. I ran along ovCa slow bell and
passed a tug to the port shortly after leaving the slip. After steaming along- a- few minutes I picked up the bell off the end of Lombard street. It was then about 6:30 o'clock,
or thereabouts. As soon as I, got my bearings from the bell I shaped my usual course for Alcatraz, running along under -slow bell. My lookout, C. H. Jansen, the second-mate,
was peering into the dense fog at the bow and my first mate, Charles Johnson, was with. me in 'the pilot-house. !â : â¢ : . , 'â :'â â '."â *â  â  '-
"About half-way between Lombard street and Alcatraz Island I heard the Sausalito's whistle. Shc^ was coming toivard me on her way from Sausalito. The
fog was at this time as dense as rver I have seen it on the bay, and I have been navigating her zvatcrs since 1849. Some little time before the Sausalito got near its I stopped
my boat and blew the danger signal. The Sausalito anszvered with her two whistles and I backed my boat* I kept her backing all the time, for I zvanted to take-un
usual precaution. While zvc were backing I suddenly saiv the dim outlines of the Sausalito's lights steaming licad-on under slow bell toward my boat. She was scarcely a
boafs length away when I first sazv her. T^he Sausalito crashed into the San Rafael just a little forzvard of amidships, where the restaurant is situated. It was' quite a
crash, but at the time I did not think it was serious enough to sink her. The women and children began to scream and many of the men folks became greatly excited. I
held my post and sent my mate below to find out the extent of tlie, damage and quiet the passengers. My crezv took their proper positions and as far as they were concerned
they kept their heads and zvorked according to their accident drill. , .â :â¢.,.â 'â¢â  . . :Â« â¢ : " Â« " P^V^V^v^
"In the meantime I sang out to Captain. Tribble of "the Sausalito to ;stay alongside and pass us a line, which he did. As soon as i'wi 'made fast Johnson came back
and reported that there was a big hole in the San Rafael's side. I then set about to do^what I could to see that everybody got aboard the Sausalito. We lozvered three life
boats and the Sausalito lowered two; Men, women and children piled into them, but we [put most of the passengers vn'the Sausalito by handing them over the rail. We
passed the women and children over the rail and through the windows and most of the men hustled on to the Sausalito without any aid.
, . "Nearly all of the passengers had on life preservers and after the first shock they behaved themselves 1 , very < zvcll. They were as cool andasjiervyaloiofpcople
as I. would want to sec anywhere. The steamer was not settling very rapidly during tlie time we were getting the passengers aboard the Sausalito^W lien her hold got fuU
of water she started to sink very rapidly, but at this time all of the passengers were aboard the Sausalito. If some of the passengers did not jump overboard during the pa\iic
immediately following the collision, and my personal opinion is that there were not any who were so foolish to do that, I should say that 'there were not 'any f lives lost. â¢ 1 dm
quite certain that nobody was lost overboard during the trans f 'erring of 'the passengers. Those that were in the water /were hauled aboard "with ropes and everybody who
went into the lifeboat that capsised had life preservers on. . * â¢ v ','''., ,;.; v ; ; -

'Andrew Wcstwater. draughtsman, said:
"I know that the .whistles Were blowing
from the time we left the slip and we
were going ahead at a slow but steady
rate. Suddenly from my position on the
upper deck I heard a whistle on the star
board bow. Shortly after, less than a
minute, the Sausalito crashed into us a
short distance above the paddle box. She
backed away soon after. It waa fully
ten minutes and probably fifteen min
utes before the San Rafael sank. When
the Sausalito backed away the water be
gan to rush into the -gap. I got into one
of the small boats with ten or twelve oth
ers. We were swamped and all of us. I
am pretty sure, came up and clung to the
gunwale. There were some women In this
boat. A Miss Bridgman of Sausalito was
one of them. It seemed to me as If we
were clinging to that boat for a full half
hour. All were rescued. In the party
were Will Shore of San Francisco and a
Mr. Moore of Corte Madera."

J. D. Warrack Believes That at Least
Eighty People Went Into the
Water After the Accident.
J. D. Warrack. an employe of the White
House residing In Sausalito, was one of
the passengers on - tho. San Rafael when
she met with disaster. /In 6peaklng of tho
Idss of tho ferry-boat said last
night: ** I# --Â«6W^::~- V:T^- ,"
. "I arrived 'At tho forry slip about 6:13
p. m. The boat was to leave ut 6:15 p. m. f
but she was ten minutes late. I should
Judge ., that between 200 and 250. people
went on the 8an Rafael when the ferry
gates were opened. I went to the card
room as soon as I got on the boat ami
was playing: whist' when the collision took
place. ' The fog was very iiense, in fact I
have never seen a thicker fog in the six
years I have lived across the 'bay. Th>;
San 'Rafael was going at half speed from
the time we started until the Sausalito
ran- into her. â¢ .* . '
"I heard whistles blown while we were
playing cards, but I did not pay any par
ticular attention to them. We knew noth
ing of the Sausalito bcjng close to us until
the collision, took place. The Saunallto
struck us on the side opposite to the curd
room 1 .wh.e.re I. was. .1. ran. out on deck
and Captain Johnson, the second mate,
told me we were in no danger. I, got a
life preserver and put It on. There was
no difficulty in getting the life 1 preserver*.
Every one around' had them on.
"There was considerable pxcitement but
no panic. Women were p creaming and
the men were trying to tjuict them. When
I got around to the other 'side of the boat
the Sausalito was close to us. She had
backed off after the collision and then
came up head-on and tied up to the San
Rafael. I helped to get women and chil
dren from the San Rafael to the SausalltS.
"Many women who were in the upper
saloon were helped through the windows
to the bridge-house, and then from that
point reached the Sausalito.
"I think that about 200 people had got
on board the Sausalito when a fireman of
the San Rafael came on deck and said the
boat was sinking. The life boats of the
two ferry-boats were lowered by tHis
time. â â¢ The passengers lowered them. I
helped to lower two. I saw many people
jump into the water when It was stated
that the San Rafael was sinking. I
should Judge that eighty people went into
the water. We threw life preservers over
from the Sausalito and lowered lanterns
with ropes.
"Two tugs came up to the scene. One
of them was there before the San Rafael
sank, the second one came up afterward.
I saw many people brougnt to the Sausa
lito In the small boats. I think about
forty were saved by the life boats. I sup
pose that the two tugs must have picked
some of the people up. I should judge
that about forty people were missing
when account was taken on the Sausalito.
If they were not saved by the tugs they
must have been drowned. The Sausalito
drifted with the ebb tide for fifty minutes
after the collision and people were being
picked up all the time by the life boats. .
"I think that the boats were lowered in
good time and that everything was done
by Captain McKenzle that It was possible
to do under the circumstances." . â '.,

"I was standing by the engine-room

forward. I ran on deck and scrambled on
board the Sausalito. My only thought
was to save my life, but when I reached
a place of safety I helped others.
"The passengers seemed to have a pre
monition of impending danger. They were
highly nervous because of the dense fog.
Every one seemed to be talking about the
danger of collision and was half ex
pecting an accident. - When the shock
came I heard groaning and I feel certain
that the cook, was pinioned by fa'llng
timbers. If any lives were lost they were
children, as the elder people had ample
time to escape from the sinking steamer."

at Signal. **
Dense Fog Makes Him
Fear Possible
Collision.
Not a Moment Lost at
First Evidence of
Danger.
MARTIN CHRISTENSEtf,
first assistant engineer on
the San Rafael, said:
"I was at the bar whea
the first signal came- to re
verse. Chief Jones had
stepped outside and we
were running under a slow
bell. I had my hand on the lever from
the time we left the ferry slip, and for
the first time In my experience the bar
was not taken out of the slot I was
standing with one hand on the. lever and
one on the bar to reverse the enginy-t
the first call when, not to my. surprisdflt
came. It was thÂ© heaviest weather I hatve
ever seen on the bay, and I knew that
at any moment there would be a call
to reverse the engine. It cams shorter
and sharper than I expected, and before
we could get sternway on the San Rafael
the Sausalito crashed Into us forward of
the pilot house.
"She cut us down to the water's edge,
and a few minutes later the firemen came
up and told me that the water was rush
ing into the engine room. I told them to
bank the fires and come up. By banking
the fires 1 thought that It .would -take
quite a while for the water to get to them,
and if the collision was very serious that

SMASHES THE CABIN
WINDOWS TO RELEASE
FEAR-STEICZEN WOMEJX
Clinton Mason, a resident of Sausalito.
was a passenger on the Ill-fated steamer
San Rafael. For a while he was on the
lower deck, but because of the heavy,
penetrating fog he sought the .upper
cabin. When the craah came Mr. Ma% n
was seated well aft In the cabin. JrjSe
only means of escape for the penned- In
passengers was through the door, quite a
distance forward of his position. .
The many women In the cabin were for
the moment panic-stricken and seemingly
unable to hel:> themselves. Aa the
steamer settled lower and lower In the
water the excited and half-crazen ladle*
crowded toward the stern of the boat
Realizing that something must be done,
and quickly, too, to avert a genoral panic
in the cabin. Mr. Mason commenced to
break the windows and tear away their
sashes that a mode of egress might be ob
tained.
As soon as a place was cleared the
women crowded about, and it was with
some effort that Mr. Mason quieted their
fears and satisfied them that there was no
danger If they kept cool. One by one the
women wcrt passed through the. open
space. In the meantime some of the pas
sengers had taken advantage ot the for
ward door. Several women were cut and
scratched by small pieces left In' tho
broken sashes, and Mason's hands were
badly cut in breaking thÂ« windows. /:

â¢Â«r "W L - BARREN of this city
Bfl H was a passenger on the
p>MÂ« steamer San Rafael. His
H E account of the disaster
13 ll Is as follows:
E H A "I started for Sausallto
*^^ â¢ on tbe 6:15 boat, but we
did not pet away from
the slip until about 6:25. The fog was
very thickâ so dense that nothing could
be seen. I was in the after cabin on the
lower deck, and I should judge that there
were one hundred passengers on the deck.
How many were above I do not know. It
seemed to me that the other boat, the
-4?.jsalito. crashed into our steamer, strik
{rx us forward of midships. We were
Fcmg slow and sounding the whistle. I
think we were backing when the collision
came. A great deal of confusion fol
lowed, the crash. The women and chil
dren in the cabin above rushed below,
end many who were in the lower cabin
hastened above. While there was a
great deal of confusion there was not a
panic. I did not see any passengers
jump overboard. What impressed me
most was the lack of system upon the
part of the San Rafael's crew. With the
assistance of passengers I think all the
persons aboard were provided with life
preservers.
"After the crash the Sau5alito tied to
the San Rafael and stood right by us un
tH our boat sank. The San Rafael went
clear out of sight, the last to vanish be
ing the top of the jackstaff. The passen
gers went from the decks of the sinking
boat to the steamer SausaUto. Some went
Xrom the lower deck, some from the deck
above and others from the top. I went
across from the roof.
'The San Rafael Eank out of sight fif
teen or twenty minutes after the crash.
Distress signals were blown at once, and
In response to the signals a Whitehall
boat v.ith three men in It came alongside
and Informed us that tugs had been sent
for to assist us. I judge that the white
hall beat came from Alcatraz. The fog
vas so thick that we could not see the
tugs until they came immediately along
side. The San Rafael sank alongside of
us. There was no explosion when she
â went down. We had drifted perhaps a
mile before the boat sank. I was told
that we were off Fort Point. There was
a long, high swell, but we were In no
great danger because the tugs were
alongside to prevent the boat from drift
ing to tbe ocean.
â¢â¢I was landed at the regular elip in
this city with the other rescued passen
gers. I did not learn that any one was
lost, but all may not have been saved. I
talked with passengers, but did not hear
reports that lives were lost. I cannot tell
how many passengers were aboard the
San Rafael, but 1 think those on the
boat were mainly the regulars from the
city to Sausalito and San Rafael at that
hour."

STORIES OF ACCIDENT
AND THEIE ESCAPE
Herman Eahn of San Anselmo Says
He Saw Some People Go Down
With the Boat
Mrs. E. Nelson of San Rafael was one
7f-f tbe passengers who spent some time In
.he water. When landed at the ferry de
pot she was transferred to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where it was found
that she was suffering considerably from
the shock. She later became hysterical,
and the doctors say that she will prob
ably suffer from the effects of her sub
mersion for some time.
J. C. Perry of Corte Madera. who was
rescued by cne of the San Rafael's life
boats, eays that one of the boats was
launched with her water plug open and
â¢was speedily swamped. He does not know
which boat It was. and claims to have got
his information from some of those who
were in her and who were obliged to jump
overboard to *ave themselves.
Perry pays a high tribute to the offi
cers and crew of the San Rafael. He says
they acted with coolness and considera
tion, that they did everything In their
power to insure the safety of the passen
gers and that to their efforts is due the
tact that there was not a terrible loss of

The fog was very thick and it was so
damp that It was best to sit in the salon
on the inside. I first heard the bell to
stop and soon after the signal to go
astern. In another second the collision
came. The San Rafael was struck square
ly amidships on the starboard side. I got
â¢%â ;â¢ en the deck and easily scrambled from
" the davits of the San Rafael to the Sau
tall to.
"An soon as I got on the Sausallto I
helped to drag the women from the San
Rafael up tbe side to the Sausallto. I
think that two boats were lowered from
the San Rafael and one from the Sausa
llto.
'The San Rafael floated about twenty
minutes after she was struck and went
down bow Jir*t. She sank with her lights
burning and I did not see anybody on
board."
Mrs. F. Goer! of San Rafael was aboard
the boat that was sunk with her brother.

tained an Injury of- the leg.
Herman Uahn of San Ansclmo said he
â¢was sure some women and children were
drowned, as he eaw them in the bow of
the San Rafael when she went down. He
declared that the ferry boat went down
bow first and before the passengers could
aÂ« be rescued.
â ^MMam Gorman, engineer on the steam
Â«"' Tamalpals. was a passenger on the
San Rafael. He was going to his home
in Sausallto. He said: "When the steam
ers flm collided there was a great panic,
but the cool-beaded demeanor of Captain
McKenzie and his men had a good effect
and they became reasonably quiet under
the circumstances. We all did what we
could to keep our own courage and help
the women and children aboard the Sau
salito. The men all* behaved like heroes.
There was no attempting to pull each
other back, and while there were many
who were beside themselves with fright
and excitement, there was no display of
cowardice on the part of any of the
men. The thing all happened suddenly.
The fog was so thick that one couldn't
see his hand In front of him and when I
first saw the Sausailto she was head on
on top of us. .1 don't think that any
lives were lost, except that some of the
women or excitable men may have
jumped overboard when the crash oc
curred."
Norman Arter of Goldberg, Bowen &
Co. was thrown into the water from one
of the lifeboats. He had a life preserver
on and was quickly hauled out. lie said:
"It was the most terrifying experience I
ever expect to have. After the panic re
sulting from the first slir,'^ we ull did
what we could to pacify the women and
girls. They kept cool when they Â»aw
how level headed Captain McKenzie was.
He deserves great credit for the way he
conducted himself during the excitement.
We all -heard the Sauna!! to whintle and
Captain McKenzie wan backing the San
Rafael when the .other boat ran him
down."
J. A. Zerman, general solicitor for Gold
berg, Bowen A Co., was among the San
Rafael s passengers. He said:- "Were It
not for the effort!? of Captain McKenzie
and his crew there would have been many
lives lost. He and his men are deserving
of the greatest Â»ralÂ«e. As one of the pas
sengers I feel that Captain McKenzie did
all rn hia power 10 avert the collision
and make a safe trip across the bay dur
ing the thick weather. After the Sausa
llto struck ub he certainly proved him
self a great and courageous teaman. Tho
fog was Â»o thick that even if many peo
ple were drowned it would be hard for
anybody else to nee tholr struggles or sco
them go down. I believe that there were
some who met their death In the collision,
but of my own knowledge I know of
none."
James G lea son of San Rafael was In tho
cabin when the collision occurred. He
raid: "I waited until all the excitement
isubMded and then grabbed one of the life
preservers and got Into It. After that I
knew I was safe, for I saw the Sausalito

CAPTAIN W. T. TRIBBLE of the Sausalito gave his statement of the accident freely, but would not 'talk at length or answer any questions as to who zvas to blame.
He neither defended himself nor attempted to place the responsibility upon the i master of the San Rafael. His brief statement was as follows: s '

aboard our vessel. I don't know how many were lost or whether any were. â "'â  We tried to save thetit all and I hope we did. < We took a great many over the bow and lowered
two boats. It was twenty minutes after the collision before the; San Rafael sank." , f ;
â¢ Captain Tribble was asked several questions when he had finished; his statement, but refused ' ! 1o [answer: any of : -them. He seemed perfectly collected and gave his

helping the women and children. Several
of us lowered about a half dozen women
Into the boats, and then when everybody
who needed any help got off the sinking
steamer I left it too and got aboard the
SauiMllto. I saw several people In the
water, and I doubt If they were saved."
Ed Thomas, a young man who lives in
Sausallto, was coming over to the city on
the Sausallto. He was talking to a friend
near the engine room and heard nil the
signals that passed between the boats.. He
said: "I first heard Captain McKenzle's
whUtle and his danger signal, which was
answered immediately by the 8ausallto.
Captain Tribble tried hard to slow down
our boat, but it was too late. The fog
was so thick that you could scarcely see
the lookout on our own boat, Jet alone the
San Rafael In front-of us." Â» , ., .
F. C. Allen of Allen & Lowry, of this
city, had just left tho San Rafael's din
ing-room when the crash came. He said:
"I was one of the fortunate' ones. I had
just left the dining-room where the bow
of the Sausallto stove through. I was
standing outside the restaurant door when
the crash came. I Immediately* ran. up
stairs and busied myself pacifying those
whom I found to be more excited than I
was. I believe that when the round-up
of passengers comes you will find at least
a dox<yi among the missing."
T. J. Lennon, tho attorney; who resides
In San Rafael, said: "I usually go homo
on an earlier boat, 1 but was persuaded to
remain Inter this time to â¢ accompany my
sister-in-law. Miss Josephine Leonhardt.

however, was In bad shape; he had one

the accident and the rescue of the pas

number of persons were drowned, and
declares, that some Jumped overboard
without life preservers* Mr. Torbert
said: v
WÂ« left the sllD la San Francisco about 1:20
and had been cone about twenty minutes
when we heard a bell. We were off Alcatraz.
I think. Our boat blew one wnlstle and then
stopped. The Sausallto blew one whistle. Wo
couldn't see her light till she was almost on
top ot us. - ,
The Sausallto seemed to be coming almost at
full -speed and swung to starboard. I heard
somebody aboard the SausaUto yell "Hani
a-s tar board'." She came last. I -was standing
outside on the lower deck and saw the col
lision. The SausaUto struck us full at right
angles. Yes, I am sure of that. She came
straight at us and not glancingly. Had sba
kept straight ahead on the course she was first
on she would not have struck us.
The San Rafael was hit just where her din
ing-room Is located. Men' who were eating at
the coffee counter at tho time were knocked
off the stools and some of them were injured.
The wheel was wrecked, too. and portions of
the paddles were thrown all over the dining
room floor. . .
The San Rafael seemed to hang on to tha
nose of the Sauaallto. A line van thrown to
us Immediately and made fast. The ladies pa
the upper deck began pouring over on to tha
Sausallto. No gang rlaak or Udder was put
out. .
I saw tome people In their excitement Jump
overboard without UfÂ» preservers. I am sure
several were drowned.
The ladles were cooler than the men. Ona
woman broke open a case containing life pre
servers and began passing them out to the
other ladles and advising them to put them on.
The- crew of the San Rafael tried to lower
her boats Immediately, but they did not seem
to get them down quickly. I g-ot In one oÂ£
them and helped rescue the p&saensrers. WÂ»
made two trips from tha San Rafael to tha
SausaUto with boat loads. Then wo rowed to
the bow of the sinking ferryboat and asked If
there were any more ladles there. Some man
shouted "So." and w* got aboard the Sausa
llto. -. \ .- ââ  ..
The San Rafael sank aldewlse and toward
the Sausallto. The water was pouring: In on
the side next the boat that bad rammed her
and the passengers were nearly all on that side.
Tha vessel went down gently and there was
little swirl above her. Bow and stern were
about on a level when she sank.
All the time the vessels were together they
were drifting: and I heard some one say wo
were off the Presidio. No one could tell Just
where the San Rafael sank, but it must havÂ«
been a long way from where she was struck.

panic on board the Sansalito, for we did
not know Just what had happened. Some
of- the more, excitable passengers were
about to Jump overboard, when they were
restrained by the cooler-headed ones. I
secured a life-preserver at once, not
knowing what would happen next.
"All of a sudden the passengers on
board the San Rafael began clambering
on board the Sausallto and we assisted
as many of them as we could reach to
reach a place of safety. It may have been
fifteen minutes before the San Rafael
sank, but It did not seem to me that long.
Many of the San Rafael passengers had
Jumped In the water, for they were swim
ming all around us. I believe that most
of these were picked up. but it was very
difficult to see for certain on account of
the density of the tog and the almost
total darkness which prevailed.
"I heard the faint cry 6f a little infant
in the water and this was the means of
rescuing the Uttle one and her father and
mother who were^truggllng in the water
wlth^thelr life-preservers. Had the baby
not cried out it is quite likely that .the
three would have been swept away before
assistance could reach them.' I was un>Â»
able to ascertain their names. .
â¢'When the Sausallto started f or* thiÂ«
side, after picking up all the passengers
in sight, another steamer hove in sight
and was within an ace of running us
down. We, on the Sausallto. who were
nearly frantic with our experience, danced
about the deck like crazy people. We
yelled to the oncoming steamer to back
away, which she did and we Just grazed
her side. It is an experience -I shall not
easily forget and I would not care to du
plicate it. I brought the life-preserver to
my hotel to preserve as a memento of the
unfortunate affair." re

condition and many of the men from the
Ean Rafael seemed unable to help them
selves. There were a great many women
and little children floating in the waterâ
*eeminrl>" twenty-five or thirty any way,
it cot more. I saw none go down, but
It ?Â«med impossible to save them, there
vrere so many. Many of them floated out
of rny sight in the fog. as there seemed
to be a strong current which carried them
â¢way. Presumably many of them were
picked up in the boats that were plying
about the steamers.
"I saw four of tbe steamer's boats in
the water: there were some from each
steamer. We heard a great many crying
out for help, merely crying. 'Help! Help!'

ENGINEER M'GUY SAYS
LI VES WERE NO T LOST
CHIEF ENGINEER. F. McGUY of the Sausalito said: "1 zvas in the engine-room zvhett the sig
nal came to reverse tlie engines. I had my family on board and left the room in charge of
R. Wasscr, the first assistant. After making a rush upstairs and finding there zvas no trouble
with the Sausalito I immediately zvent back to my post. In the meantime Mr. Wasscr had got tzvo bells
to stop and tzvo bells to go full speed astern. We were then within' a fczv yards of the San Rafael and
as I saw her I didn't think she zvould float very long. * !
"A plank zvas put out and over it the passengers from the San Rafael came, one at a time,
Tlicy were a long time in coming, but I think the bulk of them succeeded in getting aboayd'our vessel.
Some few of them may have been left behind and may have gone down with the vessel, but unless there
were many children aboard 1 don't think that any lives could liave been' lost. The tzvo vessels were
alongside each other for fully fifteen minutes and anybody that could zvalk must easily have reached
safety. â â â : . ' .
"It fopk me about sixty seconds to get my men together and in that time we got four boats lozc
ercd and had all the lifebelts ready for distribution. Everybody wanted them and nobody zvould take
one, so in fear that the ship zvould go dozen and leave them struggling in the water zee threzv all the life
belts overboard. Some of the people secured one and walked aboard the Sausalito with it tied around
their zcaists, but the great majority never attempted to get one and walked up the .'gangway as if they
never knezv that there zvas a lifebelt aboard the ship. I don't think anybody was drowned because there
were enough lifebelts floating around the vessel to float anybody who might have made a jump at the
last moment. I don't think there zvas a soul went down with tlic ship. There zvas a big panic, but zvhen
it came to the last minute I think the old San Rafael went dozen by herself. It zvas a sad ending for one
of the fastest and" best of the ferry-boats." . : " / *

31IBACTJLOUS ESCAPE
OFT, A, EEGEB FBOM
INJTJBY IN COLLISION
Alter Assisting Women and Children
to Safety He Saves His Own Life
by Means of a Hope.
A T- A. Reger of Corte Madera was among
the passengers on board the San Rafael,
and narrowly escaped death In the col
lision. He was rescued by means of a
rope, and after the landing of the Kaura
lilo was taken to the Palace Hotel, whete
several contusions of the scalp were
dressed. He makes the following state
ment of the casualty.
"I was with my friend, Jim McCue,
when the crash occurred. The bow of the
Csuealito cut into the restaurant of the
Ean Rafael, and went in about ten feet.
There were about 400 passengers . aboard.
the San Rafael in their efforts to escape
and many of them escaped that way. I
saw them coming through the windows.
Some of them â quite a number of them â
were seen to be badly cut, probably from
this mode of escape.
"After the rescue those of the San Ra
fael that were saved were greatly excited
looking for lost relatives. After we
struck it was about an hour before the
San Rafael went down.' I know of two
boats that the Sausalito lowered. There
ccemed to* be a litffle delay in getting the
boats off. While I think Captain McKen
zie of the Sausalito did his best to regu
late the crew, the crew didn't seem to
work in any way in unison or with any
effect or Intelligence, as they left It en
tirely to the passengers to save life. I
didn't see any of them making much ef
fort to save life.'
"Another thing, there didn't seem to be
rope or anything to save life available.
We had to dig around ourselves to find
things. I should judge there were at
least twenty-five or thirty lives lost from
what I saw in the water and what I
heard. One of our passengers it) trying
to save a man lost his footing and fell
overboard. I don't know whether he was
saved or not.
"After the San Rafael went down there
were quite a number floating In the wa
ter. Every effort was made to save them
and in most cases it was successful.
There was a tug boat, but I could not
see her name. Captain McKenzle called
out to the tug for his bearings and got
some answer back that I couldn't under
stand. 'It sounded like 'The Fulton Iron
Works.' The damage to our boat -was
apparently but trivial.
"After the passengers were *1rawn up
they were taken into the cabin and en-'
gine room of our boat. Some of them
were apparently unconscious. One little
child out of the water was reported dead
subsequently to being drawn up. .A sister
of G. M. Caesar, who Is connected with
Wright & Co., druggists, at 14 First
street, was pulled up on our rope, and
she was frantic about her sister, but the
latter was afterward found to have been
saved. Many of the women acted very
bravely and seemed very self possessed
We felt the boat sinking beneath us, and
everybody cried out to save himself. Thi
accident took place, as near as 1 can
Judge, about fifteen minutes after we left
the slip. People began to jump into* the
water, some with and others without life
preservers. Many of these must have
been drowned. I remained on the lower
deck after the collision for several min
utes. A party of women and children ran
to me and begged me to save them. I
took them to the upper deck and assisted
them to the deck of the Bausallto. By
this time the Ban Rafael was sinking rap-
Idly, and the upper decx was already sub
merged. I grot hold of a rope thrown from
the deck of the Sausallto, and they were
pulling me aboard when two men caught
my legs and held me. I begged 'them to
take hold of the rope below me, so that
we might all be # saved, and they took nÂ«y
advice. All of us were dragged aboard
the Saurailto in safety.
"I Â«aw many women and children < on
the upper deck, and my belief is thut
some of these were drowned. There was
considerable confusion, and the lo'ss cf
life is due to that cause. We were at a
standstill wiitn the Saueallto bore down
upon us. The whistles blew at Intervals,
and tbe fog was so thick one couldn't see
twenty feet away. I saw many people
struggling In the water, but most'of these
were picked up by the boats. \: ,

Glen Shaver/ a Passenger on the Sau

After the Vessel* Struck. .
Glen A. Shaver and William Hoxey of
San Rafael were playing cards In tbe sa
loon of tbe Saunalito when the crash
came. The shock threw Hoxey over the
table and almost tumbled Shaver upon his
back. They rushed out and found every
thing on the forward deck of the Sausalito
In a turmoil. In describing the scene
Shaver says: - ,
It waÂ» the wildest excitement I have ' ever
eeen. . The bow of the Sausaltto had cut clean
through the aid* of the Kan Rafael, and her
after dtck was filled with people crying for
help and apparently without any Idea of what
to do to save themselves. WÂ« took one of
the flatrpoiâ¢ frrrni the forward end of the Bau
eallto and ttlted It over onto the San Rafael
and men and women cÂ»mÂ« down tbe polt until
THE SA^ ANCISCO C ALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBEJl â  1, 190 lV
after being Baved. I noticed a great many
of our life preserversâ nearly all of the
passengers of the San Rafael had them
on. There were plenty of life preservers.
We threw hundreds of them over from
the Sausalito. Some of those saved had
two and three life preservers strapped
around them. There were a number of
Chinese aboard our boat and not one ef
fort was made by them to save any one.
They were perfectly indifferent. I no
ticed every one of the men that did any
work at all spoke good English.
"Immediately after the clash weâ quite
a number of the menâ went to the rail
and tried to throw over ropes and things,
but some * one in authority. or
some one that assumed authority, ordered
us back. We went back from the rail,
but nothing seeming to be done we again
went to the rail and threw ropes and life
preservers overboard. Had â¢ we stayed
back 1 don't believe there would have
been as many saved as there were.
"We left at 6:10 and about 7:40 the San
Rafael went down. In the meantime she
sank gradually and then went down with
a rush. In going down she scraped the
guards of the Sausalito and In doing so
Injured severely several of the rassengeis.
I do not know who the injured were. I
heard one man's ear was taken off."
WITH LEGS CRUSHED
BOBBINS CBAWLS UP
FROM DINING-ROOtf
Says Some One Cut Wrong Hope and
Let Boatload of Passengers
Fall Into the Bay.
Frederick A. Robbins, manager of the
machinery of the American Can Company,'
had a truly miraculous escape from going
down with the San Rafael. Robbins was
in the restaurant eating his dinner when
the collision occurred. He was pinned
down beneath his table, which was over
turned by the flying timbers. Although
both his legs were badly A crushed he
crawled up to the upper dÂ«ck of the San
Rafael and succeeded in climbing aboard
the Sausalito He was taken to the lte
ctlvlnpr Hospital and later removed to the
Lick House. He said:
"I was sitting in the restaurant eating
my dinner. The Sausalito struck the San
Rafael directly at the point where the
restaurant Is situated. The vessel must
have been traveling at a high rate of
speed, as the prow penetrated the side of
the San Rafael, smashing everything to
pieces. Water splashed through the open-
Ing and I was drenched.
"The sight was indeed pitiable. When
one of the boats was loaded with people
the two boats separated. A boat from the.
San Rafael put off. but It was caught In thÂ«
vortex of the whirlpool when the steamer sank
and went down in It. It was full of people
and I am sure few or them ' escaped. The
water was full of people swimming; ana call-
Ing- for assistance. Tom Lennon, an attorney
of San Francisco, swam around for half an
hour in the watÂ«r. I saw him swimming ther*
and >aw him helped out. Another man tc
whom we threw a rone grasped It and was
carried under the overhang -of the Sausallto.
We hauled him up and as he came we could
hear him laughlnK and crying as if in hys
terics. We got him an far as the deck, but
before we could get him over we felt him
flipping down the rope. He dropped back Into
the water and was drowned.' ' .
The Hausullto was rolns; very slowly. We
heard her whintles blowing; frequently and we
thought line wus KClng Into the dock; in fact,
we doubted If we could finish the - game we
were playing before she landed. The boots on
the San Rafael were put out promptly, but 1
understand the pluirs were not In and the tar
paulins were over them no that they. could nol
be promptly launched. Any way I siw at
least one of them, full of people.- sink. ' ' .
I Haw the San Rafael gn down. It was not
more than twelve or thirteen minutes after
she was struck; and when she went down
her after deck and the saloon beneath neemed
to be full of people. 1 do not know how many
were drowned, but the Ban Rafael's passen
gers Bay the boat was crowded. I am sure a
great many lives were lost. â¢â  â¢ . -â¢

some one cut the wrong roje and the
whole load was spilled into the bay.
Ropes and life preservers were thrown to
the people who were struggling in the
water.
"When I got free from the overturned
table which was pinning me to the floor
of the restaurant I crawled to the stern
of the San Rafael and made my way
aboard th* Sausalito. The men on board
the San Rafael* acted in the most com
mendable manner. I saw many assisting
ladles aboard the Sausalito. There was
no excitement to speak of; at least not as
much as usually occurs on such occasions.
There was a little excitement shown when
the captain told us to hurry aboard the
Sausalito. The captain seemed to have
good control of himself. â  <
"When the boats collided there was an
old man. whom I understand was from
Corte Madera, seated In the restaurant
near the side. One of his ears was com
pletely revered from his head by a flying
piece of limber."
The scene when the Sausalito landed at
the 'dock was one of tremendous excite
ment. Men rushed frantically off the
steamer and hastened to various places
where they could find a telephone to no
tify friends' and relatives of their safety.
Hysterical women wept 'and .run excited-,
|y about looking for friends. The news
of the disaster spread about the water
f rent with lightning rapidity and a large
crowd gathered at the- Sausallto's dock.
The clang, clang of the ambulance bell
as the vehicle hurried through the crowd
to pack the few Injured and half drowned
survivors to the hospital added to the ex
citement. Lieutenant of Police Jack Mar
tin and Sergeant Brophy were on hand
with a score of policemen and they did
good work In keeping the crowd In check.

Terry says he .was unable to make his
way to the decks of the Sausallto and
was. precipitated into the water by the,
sudden lurching of the vessel, after she
was struck by the Sausallto. / ';:>
"I found myself in the water almost
before I; knew It," said Terry, "although
I succeeded in grabbing a life preserver
before I fell overboard. I immediately
set, about to keep my head above water.
I had no sooner done so, when I felt two
little arms entwine around my neck and.
discovered that a little boy had nlso been
thrown into- the water and had' taken
that way to , save himself. I. found no
difficulty to support him, but â¢ when a

"Mr. Tompklns of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank was with me, and he
agreed with me to stay on the boat as
long as we could. Between ten' and fif

San Rafael went under. As she went
down I jumped for the Sausalito, which
was close by. and caught on her rail. . I
was not strong enough to haul myself up,
so I hung on and shouted for help. None
of the crew of the Sausalito heard ime,
and 1 finally let ,?o my hold from exhaus
tion ana dropped, Into the water. My life
preserver, kept me afloat, and twenty
minutes later I got hold of a rope lowered
from the Sausalito and was hauled on
board of that vessel. I was almost com
pletely exhausted and had given up all
hope when. I was finally rescued."
Mr. Moore, who is about 60 years old,
thinks his escape was miraculous. In his
opinion most of the . passengers on the
San Rafael were saved. He said: _. . '
"The two boats stayed together after
the collision. It was soon learned on the
Sausalito that she was not â¢ seriously In

Immediate steps to rescue the unfortunate
passengers on the San Rafael. She ran
a gangplank over to the sinking vessel
and many of our passengers escaped in
that way.
"After the San Rafael went down the
Sausalito stayed by and lowered ropes to

"We left the slip for Sausalito at 6:15
o'clock, ten minutes late: I was on the

hunters,, worklngmen and the ordinary
Saturday evening crowd. \ I was in the
small card -room on the left side of the

"When the noise of splintering planks,
accompanied by shouts of men and
screaming of women, reached me I ran
to the right side and up to the wheel. I
saw that the passageway was blocked by

already out and that we were sinking. I
then met James McCue of Corte Madera,
who Â«aa in the right restaurant at the
time of the collision. The bow of the
Sausaltto had cut into the side of the
San Rafael like a knife, and the restau

was being assisted by friends. His scalp
was cut and one leg broken. I then got I
a life preserver and assisted in the work
of getting ropes to the Sausalito, by
which: we were enabled to get a hold on
the 'boat. I then climbed up on a water
barrel near the paddle-wheel' and passed
women and children Up to the top of the

assisted to the deck of the Sausalito by
a number of marines, who. did excellent

' cides to Remain.
William Knlll. the ' well-known book
maker, who lives at Sausalito, met his
wife and three small children at the ferry
The restaurant was crowded. I should Judje
that thÂ«re were fully sixty In thÂ« reitaurant.
I was startled by a crash on the starboard
â Ide of â¢ the ship and the lights went out in the
restaurant. I was knocked off my Â»eat to thÂ«
floor and. raisins myself. I ran out to the lower
deck and secured a life-preserver. I then tan
to the stern of the San Rafael and saw that a
hawser had bean attached to the Sausallto. I
watched the excited scene for. several minutes
and was surprloed to see that no efforts were
made to launch the boats. 1 noticed the San
Kafarl was keellnr over and swung; myself
hand over hand on the hawser to the Sausallto.
I could not have gained my point of safety six
ty seconds when I heard the order given to cut
Ioosp from the San Rafael. The hawser was cut
loose with an ax by one nf the crew. 'Soon
after the Saunallto drifted away from the San
Rafael and thÂ« latter boat soon sank. She went
down head first and I am certain that I saw
many women, men and children standing on the
upper deck In tbe otern of the boat when she
went down. ' :-.'.

at the first sign of danger. After floating
around for a few minutes they . were
picked up by ; a boat from the Sausallto.
Just as they were rescued, Mr. Bccdy saw
a little boy about 5 years old contentedly
seated on a floating bench, though evi
dently wondering at what had happened.
The lad was picked up and placed on
the Bausallto, where he was put In charge
of the officers and crew. He had been In
the company of his mother and an elder
slstor a few minutes before, but no trace
of his relatives- had been found 'by* Mr.

UNKNOWN WOMAN LEAPS

, OAKLAND, Nov. 30. ~An, unknown wom
an Jumped Into the bay from. the after
deck of the ferryboat Berkeley, at 10:3)
o'clock ' .' to-night " off ,' Goat . Island. The
steamer was on â¢ the way to Oakland.
â¢ Tho suicide's ' leap was witnessed by a
"The San Rafael was sinking rapidly by
this time. We saw people in the upper
cabin trying to break the windows and
thus make their escape. When we got
on tbe Sausalito we secured all the
life preservers and threw them over
board to those who were struggling in
the water. Three of the four boats on
the Sausalito were lowered and the peo
ple picked up. Captain - Trlbbel of tho
Sausalito seemed to have lost his head
completely. The boats were lowered by
tbe passengers, and the rescue work was
ordered by passengers. After the San
Rafael sank out of sight we were allowed
to drift about aimlessly in the fog for an
hour. Had it not been for the appear
ance of a tugboat on the scene, an offi
cer of which gave us our bearings, it Is
bard to say where we would have landed.
"Mr. Hood of Sausalito was one of the
last to leave the San- Rafael. He In
formed ua that he saw a number of
women and children huddled together in
the main cabin. If this be true, thos-9
people must have gone down with th^""
vessel. I saw one woman who was saved,
and she stated that her baby was lost.
She was hysterical and little could be got
from her. We heard a child in the water
crying for her mamma, and as she was
holding on to a life preserver she was
saved. The wife and child of an engineer
of the Tamalpals Railroad -was seen on
board the San Rafael Just before the col
lision, .but a diligent search among the
rescued failed to bring either to light.
The inference is that they were drpwned.
"The San Rafael was at a standstill
when the Sausalito hove In sight. Had
tbe Sausalito also come to a halt the col
lision could not have taken' place. She
seemed to be caught in the tide and thus
forced full upon the San Rafael. The
captain of the Sausalito* seemed to have
Io3t his head, and after the San Rafael
sank the captain of the ill-fated boat
took command. The fog was very dense,
but it seems to me the accident might
have been avoided."

a relative from the East, an Invalid who
had just arrived on the overland from
Chicago. t
Knlll hesitated about making the trip,
and finally vetoed his wife's proposition .
to go . home. Instead he drove to the
Palace and registered for the night.
Knlll left a party of friends, all prom
inent turfmen and bookmakers, residents
of Sausalito. who made the trip on the
unfortunate San Rafael. When he heard
of the accident he endeavored to locate
them. At midnight all of Knill'3 ac
quaintances save Ralph Curtis, a sheet
writer at the Oakland racetrack, bad been
accounted for.

was stopped and a boat lowered, but no
trace of the woman was found.' There
was nothing left behind to disclose the
suicide's identity. She was clad In a
black dress and hat; her face being so
heavily veiled that her features were con
cealed.

ranches are situated. Irieoyen, a lawyer
of Juarez. Mexico, laid claim to the land
feventeen years ago, alleging that he ac

the company took possession. Several
oourts passed upon his claim, which at
one time he offered to compromise for

Ms favor, decreeing that the company pay
him an indemnity of about $15,000,000 for
Ell ores taken out of the mines, as well

CITY MURDERER
Marysville Officers Be

Answers the Description of
the Slayer of Miss . '
Schumacher. > .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE. Nov. 20.â The police of
this city believe they have In custoOy
James Redmond, who is 'wanted in Kan
sas City. Mo., for the murder of Miss
Schumacher. â¢ â¢ *
Officer Single on Wednesday night de
tected two men In the act of stealing a
ham from in front of the United States
Hotel and arrested them. One of the men,
v.ho gave his name as James Cornell,
was sentenced to sixty days In the County
Jail by Judge Raish yesterday. District
Attorney McDaniels believes Cornell to be
James Redmond, alias Coleman.
The man was recognised after his arrest
by Policeman McCoy, *no had a photo
graph and description of the Kansas City
murderer. Should he prove to be not the
man. it is a remarkable case of similarity
in appearance. .
With the description of Redmond, as
sent out by the Chief o* Police of KansPs
City, is a statement that the man slu.t
and killed Miss" Schumacher, a clerk in
a store, while he was attempting to rob
the plate. He is described as having tnt
tooed on his left forearm a ballet girl
tvith sword in hand; on the right forearm
a tombstone, a weeping willow, a suilor
and an anchor. There Is a wart on the
left side of Redmond'*, neck. The man
now serving time In the County Jail has
all of these marks.
At the time of the murder Redmond
was supposed to have been shot in the
mouth, the bullet striking the lower Up
and passing through the left cheek. This
man has a number of teeth missing from
the left jaw and a very plain scar appearj
on the cheek.
Photographs of Cornell have been taken
and will be forwarded with full descrip
tion to the Kansas Cltv authorities.
THE CHEF AND HIS MINIONS.
Inside View of a Big Hotel's Kitchea
Department.
For his services 'the chof of a big hotel
may receive Slu.umJ a y^ar, a big salary for
cooking, but by no means out of proportion
to his value to the hotel, lie Is supreme
In his workshop, the kitchens, which are
large, brilliantly lighted and scrupulous
ly clean roomd, with hardly a suggestion
in the air of broiling and baking and
roasting and frying that is eroing on all
around. The cher, with sub-chefs over
the butcher shops, the soups, the entree*,
the masts, the vegetables, the bakeehopx
and the pastries and a hundred cooks
are calling cut orders in French, for they
are nearly all French or Swiss, and
French is the language of the kitchen as
well as of the court whenever a good
cuisine is attempted, and bustling around
in their white caps and aprons, so Intent
on their work that the intrusion of a
stranger is not noticed. The waiters, in
their black coats, with their order cards
and their trays, thread their way In and
out among the cooks, each hurrying to fill
his order in the shortest possible time.
It is a finely specialized kitchen, however,
and all the scurrying back and forth and
shnll calls in Krench for portions of
many dishes s*-em confusing only for a
moment. Then follows an appreciation of
the wonderful system of the place that
insures the highest art In cooking, of the
men who do nothing but roast all day
with a knowleiige of the exact number of
minutes and even seconds required to pro
duce the best results, of others woh jug
gle copper skillet*, and of others who fry
and bake and carve and garnish, and. of
the gardemanger where the portions of
meat and raw foods are prepared and
dressed in readiness for the range.
Each ccok attends only to the prepa
ration of his own dishes, and as for the
chef, he seldom cooks at all. He has an
offlcf* of his own. where he keeps his
memoranda, his books and his special
menus and the secrets of his business.
During the rush hours his place Is In the
center of the kitchen, directing, watching
and when necessary admonishing. If Â»ev
eraJ big banquets are in progress, making
it necessary to send hundreds of portions
of v>aoh dish to them Â«t once, it in the
chefs duty to see that these courses are
sent up promptly and to cluck off each
onf on the bulletin board at the i.me It Is
sent. When he goes off duty one of his
assistants takes his olace. Besides the
cooks there are a dozen men and women
who do nothing but peel potatoes, others
v.ho make toast and still others who at
tend to the dishwashing machine. The
butcher and his assistants have charge of
the supplies of meats, some of whichâ
for instance, berfâ are kopt In the big re
frigerators, where the temperature never
varies a degree for three months before
serving. In strong contrast with the dishes
they have beon preparing Is the compara
tively simple dinner or the cooks thenv
selves. As they sit at the. long table In
their white aprons and caps, before each
one is placed a bottle of claret. They are
the only employes to whom the hotel
serves wine. This is a right Jealously
guarded by the cooks, and. they allege,
made necessary by their work over hot
ranges.â George Barry Mallon In Alns

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
OF THE HOUSE HOLD CAUCUSES
Representative Henderson of Iowa Is : Again Chosen Speaker, and
Richardson of Tennessee Is the Choice of the Minority "Mem-r
. bers for Leadershipâ- Bourbons Score Trusts and 'Free Silver
\T Tf T/ASHINGTON, Nov. 3O.-The
\\ y\ / caucus of the Republican
yl/xlf members of the House was
V V held In the House of Repre
sentatives this afternoon
and lasted about three
hours. Spf aker Henderson and the old
officers of the House wore made the
unanimous choice of the caucus, and the
major portion of the time was devoted to
nn effort led by Representative Hepburn
of Iowa to effect some changes in the
rules of the last House. Hepburn has
made a similar fight for the liberalizing
of the rules at the opening of each Con
gress for a number of years, but without
success, and to-day he was again unsuc
cessful.
Cannon of Illinois presided over the de
liberations of the caucus and Loudensla
ger of New Jersey acted as secretary.
There were 146 of the 19S Republican
members of the House present. Lacey of
Iowa placed General Henderson in nom
ination for Speaker and he was unani
mously chosen as the candidate of the
caucus. He was escorted to the chair
by a committee consisting of Payne of
New York. Tawney of Minnesota and
Lacey of Iowa. In response to a very
enthusiastic reception Henderson ad
dressed the members of the caucus, say-
Ing in part: '
We nre confronted now with work which
will aflert the mlmls of the i*H>ple at the elec
tions next yoar. Every Republican will bs
upon hlÂ» mettle. We w!lt expect ihc Kanis
from the ofpoMtlon. Thrre Is always more
activity at every CoDgri'Â«s preceding a Con
gressional election than at any other time.
We wltl require all of the wisdom we ponses*
and all of the patriotism, for we have a great
danger to confront ux continually, and that lt>
the surplus In the treusury. I appeal to my
tolicagues. Republicans, to keep In mind that
this Is a danger, and If we can be wise In the
{â resenc-e of that danger we will find approval
from the American people. The American
l>eople do not ex|>ect any niggardliness in the
treatment of the matters that they rÂ»o.ulre. I
do not counsel that, but I counsel that con
servative consideration of every question which
vhould be ob<erved at all tlinen. without ref
erence to the hundred millions that we are Â»<>on
to have.
Henderson urged the members to be
regular In attendance upon the sessions of
the House.
Sherman of New York then offered an
omnibus resolution' for the re-election of
the old officers of the old HouseâAlex
ander McDowell of Pennsylvania, as
clerk; Henry Cas<Â»on of Wisconsin, us
sergeant at arms; W. J. Glenn of New
York, as doorkeeper: Joseph C. Mctelroy
of Ohio, as postmaster, and Henry M.
Couden of Michigan, as chaplain. This
resolution also was unanimously adopted.
Oppose Modification of Rules.
Hepburn's efforts to seÂ«-ure a modlflca-
Hon of the rules followed. Dalzell of
'Pennsylvania offered a resolution for the
adoption of the old rules with certain
prescribed changes which, however, did
not alter the operation of the rules
themselves. His resolution was as fol
lows:
Resolved That the rules of the House of
Repre*entÂ»tlves of the Fifty-sixth Congress be
adopted as the rules of the House of Repre-
Hentatlves of the Fifty-seventh Congress, with
the following modifications:
Firstâ That the special orders or March S and
March 14. 1900. providing a method for the con
sideration of pension claims and other private
bills, shell be continued during the l-'lfty-
Mventh Congress.
Secondâ That the place of the select commit
tee on the twelfth census rules of the Fifty
sixth Congress shall b? filled In the rules of
the Flfty-*eventh Congrras by a standing com
mittee to consist of thirteen members and have
jurisdiction of all proposed legislation concern
ing the census and the apportionment.
Resolved, further. That there shall be ap
pointed to serve during the Fifty-seventh Con
gress a select committee en Industrial arts ana
expositions, to consist of nine members, whlc.-.
shall have Jurisdiction of all matters except,
those relating to the revenue and appropria
tions referring to the centennial of the Louis
iana purchase and proposed expositions.
Resolved, further. That the select committee
on the examination and disposition of docu
ments of th- Fifty-sixth Congress shall be con
tinued as a select committee In the Fifty
seventh Congress.
Adopt Temporary Rules.
Mr. Hepburn immediately offered an
amendment providing . that the rules
should be adopted temporarily for forty
days, at the end of which time they should
be placed before the House for considera
tion. He made a very earnest argument
in favor of this temporary action. In the
course of which he pointed out four ma
terial changes which he believed should
be made In the rules as they have existed
for several Congresses. One of these was
to provide that the right of recognition,
now lodged In the Speaker, should be
given to the first member addressing the
chair; the second was to provide for four
suspension days a month instead of two;
the third was to provide for the revival
of the old "morning hour" as it existed
before the first Congress of which Mr.
Reed was Speaker, and the fourth was to
provide that Senate amendments to the
House bills should be subjected to the
ALL-AMERICAS
MEET DEFEAT
San Jose "Fans" See a
Splendid Game of
Baseball.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 30.â San Jose was
treated to a spectacular game of baseball
this afternoon by Lajole's All-Amer'cas
and tho National Leaguers, in which the
former were defeated by a score of 5 to'Z
A small but enthusiastic crowd of fans
witnessed the finest exhibition of ball
ever seen here, by the greatest players
on the American diamond. Tremendous
hitting and brilliant fielding characterized
the contest. The National Leaguers
played an errorless game, while the
All-Americas made seven blunders. Of
the errors four were made by Irwln, the
famed short stop. Muddy grounds made
fielding difficult. The fielding of Picker
ing and the heavy batting of Davis, Brad
ley and Lajole of the All-Americas, with
the catching of Chance and the clean
work of Van Haltren and McHale for the
Nationals were features of the game,
McHale made three hits out of four times
at bat. Pickering won the admiration of
the audienco by .accepting a difficult
chance from a long drive by Carr, far out
Into left field. Chance distinguished him
self by catching two hard fouls.
The All-American made eight hits off
Mercer's delivery and he gave â¢ two men
base on balls. 'Bernard of the All-Amer
icas struck out five men and allowed eight
base hits. Â« , '
â¢The All-Americas were first to bat, but
were retired In short order. Mertes scored
for the Nationals. The second Inning was
uneventful. In the last of the third the
Nationals added another run, Van Hal
tren scoring on an error of Lajole, who 1
threw wildly. In a double play. No runs
were made in the fourth, but in the fifth
the Nationals made two. These were
made by Van Haltren and Mercer.'
In the sixth Inning the Nationals did
some pretty field* work, the chief feature
of which , was a double play by Irwln to
Lajole to Davis, but they, were unable
same points of order to which they would
be subject had the amendments originated
in the House. ' â¢
Dalzell of Pennsylvania replied at con
siderable length to Hepburn's argument,
contending that the present rules were an
evolution, and had worked bo admirably
in facilitating the transaction .of. business
that the Democrats, despite their outcry
against them during the Fifty-first Con
gress, had not dared to materially modify
them when they, came back into power In
the Fifty-second Congress. He took occa
sion to score Hepburn for harping on the
subject of the rules.
The discussion lasted about two hours.
Shattuck of Ohio supported the Dalzell
resolution. Crow of Pennsylvania, though
generally in favor of the old rules, desired
a modification which would take away
from the chairmen of committees the
power of controlling time on measures be
fore the House. When Hepburn's motion
was put it was defeated by an overwhelm
ing vote of 3 to 1.
He then offered in succession as distinct
amendments the four modifications of the
rules which he had suggested in his argu
ment. These were in turn voted down.
The highest vote which any of them re
ceived was 41. No question of policy was
broached at the caucus.
Caucus of Democrats.
The Democratic members of the House
of Representatives met in caucus in the
hall of the House at 11 o'clock to-day.
There are 151 Democrats and eight Fu
sionists, Silverites and Populists in the
House. Of these members of the min
ority 126 were present, including- Shafruth
of Colorado and Newlunds of Nevada. Sil
verites. Neville and Stark, Populists, of
Nebraska declined to enter the caucus.
Hay of Virginia, chairman of the Demo
cratic caucus, presided. Without opposi
tion the following selections were made
for officers of the House, to be presented
at Iht) meeting of the House next Mon
day:
Speakerâ Richardson, Tennessee.
Clerkâ Kx-Rfpresentattve James Kerr,
Pennsylvania.
Sergeant at armsâ Ex-Representative E.
V. Brook.slUf, Indiana.
Doorkeeperâ Charles Edwards, Texas.
Postmasterâ James K. Jackson, Ala
bama.
The selection of Richardson as candi
date for Speaker clothes him officially
with the minority leadership. The four
places on the House rent allowed the min
ority will be filled by Isuac Hill of Ohio.
assistant sergeant at arms, and James F.
Knglish of California. Felton B. Knight
of Georgia and Kwing Bland, aon of Sil
ver Dick Bland of Missouri, special ; em
ployes.
Appeals to the Minority.
Richardson briefly thanked the caucus
for the honor done him, and said:
I shall not attempt here and now to discuss
or lay down any principles by which we are
to be governed a* a party. It would nut be
appropriate for me to do so.* There is ono
thing, however, that I will say now at the very
beginning of our service, bei-ause I believe It 1b
proper that It should be said. It H this: 1
urge upon you and each of you the burpasalng
Importune* of attending the wsalona of the
House. We have a minority consisting of about
1*) members. If every member of this oppo
sition will attend our seiwlon.t and answer
when his name m called, wo will make our op
position effective and oftentimes will be able
to drteat our opponents In their efforts to pats
unwise and Improper measures. 1 feel that I
nave the right to auk you, and I do .mk you
now that, you are chosen to All a.Â«eat in the
Houje. that you will be aa anxious to occupy
that seat here aa you assured your constitu
ents you were desirous of ocuupylns It before
the election. If we are punctual In our attend
ance, although in the minority, we will be able
to do much In the way of enacting- wholesome
legislation, and. more and above all. we will
be- able to prevent the enactment of many bad
law*. The country will, when the session
closes, pass Judgment, not only on the action
and conduct of the .majority tide of the House,
but also on the minority side, and If Â«Â« have
acted wisely and patriotically we will place our
party In the ponltlon to deserve and to com
mand a decisive victory In the Congressional
elections of next year and a still greater tri
umph in the national contest of 1904.
Resolutions Denounce Trusts.
The interesting portion of the caucus
followed. Representative McClellan of
New York, at the direction of the Demo
cratic members of the New York delega
tion, who had met Just prior to the as
sembling of the caucus, offered the fol
lowing resolution as an expression of the
sense of the caucus:
Resolved. That we shall promote to the ut
most of our power the removal of the opprei-
Hive, restrictive and oiten prohibitory features
of the existing tariff. It hat been truly de
clared to be the mother of trusts. The tend
ency to create combinations of wealth, estab
lishing practical monopolies In the manufac
turing and commercial Industries of the UnltM
States, threatens the future existence of Indi
vidual manufacturers and merchants and
tradesmen of moderate or small means.
The tendency must undermine the sturdy
independence of targe bodies .of Ameri
can citizens and may well be deemed the most
serious menace, to the moral and political wel
fare of the country. The time has come when
to score. The All-Americas pulled them
selves together in tho seventh, and by
timely batting made two runs, Davis and
Lajolc scoring. Stolnfeld of the Nationals
scored In the eighth. The two teams will
play again to-morrow afternoon. The
score:

No More of Pree Silver.
The presenting of this resolution pre
c.pituted a row. Richardson attempted to
prevent the reading of It by a motion to
refer all resolutions to a special commit
tee of twelve, who should report at a
future caucus, but this motion was ruled
out of order pending the reading of the
resolution.
When the reading was concluded,- Ball
o-' Texas gave notice that he would offer
tho Kansas City platform as a substitute
and withdrew the report of Fitzgerald of
New York and McDermott of New Jer
sey, both of whom protested against the
injection of the financial issue into the
Democratic councils.
"We cannot ever win," declared Fitz
gerald, "if v/e do not discard the heresy
of free silver."
"We can never win," retorted Ball,
"unless men calling themselves Demo
crats support the national platforms of
the Democratic party."
After further sharp exchanges. Rlch
ardson succeeded In quelling the disturb
ance by renewing his motion to refer all
resolutions to a special committee, to be
appointed by the chairman of the caucus.
This motion prevailed. The following res
olutions were then introduced:
Resolved. That the Hon. James D. Richard
ton and the Democratic members of the Demo
ctatlc House Committee on Ilules. when ap
pointed, and three members to be appointed by
them, constitute a committee to have In charge
the control and direction of the policy of the
Democratic party In the House of Reprenenta
tlves except as ordered by a caucus of the
party.
By Burlson of Texas:
Resolved. That every Representative In Con
gress participating In this caucus shall be gov
erned by the action of aald -caucus where the
same dees not conflict with the declaration of
principles and policies set forth In the last
platform adopted by the Democratic party In
national convention afscmbled.
Resolved. That the best Interests of the Dem
ocratic party will be subserved by the mem
bership of said party In Congress refraining
from soliciting patronage at the hands of the
administration.
By Representative Fitzgerald of New
York:
Resolved. That we oppose any Interference
with the existing standard of values. That
question has been settled by repeated and over,
whelming expressions of popular sentiment and
must be definitely closed to the statutory rec
ognition of gold as the sole standard. The
Democracy of New York has the very greatest
respect for their brethren who for many years
sought the establishment of a bimetallic stand
ard. But the Interests of capital and labor
alike, and above nil. the Interests of the wage
earners of thÂ« country, forbid that the legal
standard of value be uncertain.
By Representative Newlands of
Nevada: .
Resolved. That an advisory committee be se
lected, consisting of one member from each
State, selected by the delegation of such State,
of which the leader of the minority shall be
chairman and the whip shall be secretary.
Thes" resolutions having been referred,
a motion was made and carried that .the
committee which Is to be appointed to
consider them shall report ; to a caucus
to meet Friday evening, January 10. The
caucus then adjourned.

Improper Connection of the
Retired Official With a
Sanitarium Company.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 80.â The President
to-day appointed Thomas B. Ferguson
Governor of Oklahoma, vice William M.
Jenkins, removed. In taking this action
the President attached to the papers tho,
following memorandum;
Governor Jenkins of Oklahoma Is harvby rÂ»-Â»
moved because of nls improper connection -witia
a contract between the Territory and thÂ» O*U
homa. Sanitarium Company. The decision is
based wholly upon his own written statements
and his oral explanation of them at the hear*
One of the duties of the Terltorial Ooverno*
la to enter into tho contract wita aocn* peraoa
or corporation Xor the keeping of tha Insaa*
of the Territory. Governor Jenkins mada tads
a contract with the Oklahoma Sanitarium Com
pany, a corporation, toe promoters of which
reserved J1O.0OO of Its stock for the Oorwao*
and subject to bis orders.
In the Governor's explanation of til* a-Eatr
be says be told the promoters at tlw time tiey
desired him to sanction tha contract "that It
was an Important contract; that X bad torn*
friends whom I would like to havÂ» mttrertafl
In the company, to whom I owed some obUgaÂ»
tlona which I would not bo able to par by aa
appointment or anything -of that kind." Tba>
stock was delivered to a banker subject to tit*
Governor's order and was turned over to t&es*
friends, whose political services the Oovernor
thus sought to reward.
The extent of the favor to the Governor and
his friends Is suggested by the fact that th*
only known sale of the stock since the contract
waa given out was at double the price paid
for it.
As performance of the contract was to b*
the sole business of the corporation, it is ob
vious either the Territory waa obligated to pay
far more than the service 'was worth, or that
its helpless wards were to have the enormou*
profits contemplated taken out of their keepi.
The Governor's confessed relation to the
matter displays such a lack of appreciation of
the high fiduciary nature of the duties of his
office as to unfit him for their further dls*
charge.
A sound rale of public policy and morals
forbids a public servant from seeking or ao>
ceptlngr any personal benefit In a transaction
wherein he has a public duty to perform.
A, chancellor would not for the moment re*
tain a trustee who. in dealings for -the trust,
reserved an advantage to himself. The thought
la not to tc- tolerated that the President can
be less vigilant and exacting In the public's
interest. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

fully Introduced until the Armstrong sys
tem was adopted in August. 1864.
SALUTEâ A. O. S.. City. Two reasons
are given why twenty-one guns are A
royal salute. The first is that twenty
one is the number of years fixed by Eng
lish law as the age of majority, and tha
other is that seven was the original saluta
tfnd that three salutes of seven guns each
were fired to typify the three kingdoms-
England, Ireland and Scotlandâ ruled by

to one another: "Go to. let us make brick

LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER-M. T..
City, j A young man wishing to become a
locomotive engineer should make appli
cation to the master mechanic of the road
selected. It successful he will be put to
work* in the roundhouse wiping ths
wheels, driving rods, frames, guides, cyl
inders, truckfe and tanks of the engines.
By keeping his eyes open he will gradu
ally learn a great deal about the work-
Ings of an engine or locomotive and in
course of time will be promoted to the po
sition of "fire cleaner" and from that to
"hostler." when he will be required to
keep the boilers full of water, see that
all the parts are- properly cleaned. and that
each engine is dally shifted Into the stall
set apart for it. when he has become
thoroughly familiar with tho duties of
hostler he stands a chance of being sent
out as a fireman on an extra train, or to
act as â¢ substitute for a regular fireman
who is sick or taking a holldajr. The next
promotion is to the rank of "extra" and in
time to full-fledged engineer.
LONGEVITY-S. H.. City. The Medical
Record is authority for the assertion that
woman has the advantage of man as re*
gards longevity. The comparative mor
tality of the sexes at different ages shows
that in the first year of life the mortality
of the female Is much less than that o'f
the male, being at birth 92.64 per thou
sand as against 112.S0. and at the end of
the year 31.87 . per thousand as against
S3.0S. This difference continues up to the
fourth year. From S to 12 the female mor
tality. Is greater than that of the male.
being at the later period 3.56 for males and
â 1.23 for females. At the age oX 46 the male
mortality equals that of the female, the
latter having been up to this time slightly
In excess. During the years -16 to 56 the
period of the climacteric, the male mor
tality gains rapidly on the female, being
6.32. for the one and 3.47 for the other.
Hence 'the climacteric la a much mora
serious' time 'for man .than for .woman.
After 56 the female t mortality gains i on
that of the male, but Is always sUffhtljr
below it. "Woman has not only & lesa mots

t're when a member of the order from

:r> report himself to the grand secretary
of th*> order and then have that official
place the Individual in th* charge of
some court to take care of him. It olten
happened that persons reporting tbem
pplves In need of fraternal asslrtance pre
s-cntcd themselves on a certain day of the
week, nith the result that various cases
were frequently assigned to tbe same
oourt. aad complaint followed.
To obviate this source of complaint
some cf the wise heads conceived the
idea, cf organizing a relief committee to
work on the same lines as the Odd Fel
lows, eo that there should be no impo
niticn on any one pubordinate body and
that assistance could be rendered with
out delay. Those in charge of the matter
have consulted with the various local
courts, which represent a membership tn
excess of 6W. and enthused them In the
work cf the nÂ»w body to the extent that
cl! promised to give the committee its
hearty support. Arrangements have been
made to obtain the funds Necessary to
carry on the work of helping those who
may apply for assistance.
The general committee that has been
appointed to attend the function that It
to be given on December S is composed

honor for having during the recent con
test brought in for Initiation the greatest
number of strangers.
An individual representing himself as a
Workman from one of the lodges of Iowa
has been visiting the local lodges nsk'np
for assistance. On the night of the 23d
of November he visited Golden West
Lodge, whpre he told that he was a
teamster, was In need of employment and
had been promised two places, but could
not accept either until he obtained per
mission from the Teamsters' Union to go
to work, and that hÂ« was in distress, be-
ing without funds, would like a small
loan until he could earn enough to repay
it. He told such a plausible story that
he was assisted to the extent of 93 75. The
following Monday night he visited Eureki
Valley Lodge, where he told the same
story, but did not say that he had been
assisted by Golden West. There a purse
of S3 SO was made up for him. and'ladt
Wednesday he called at Valley Lodge and
told the officers the story he had told
In the other lodges. He was told to watt
and at the proper time bis case would
come up for consideration, when he could
make his statement. He remained thero
until Major Blackman, a district deputy,
who had seen him at Golden West, and
Deputy Kidd, who had seen him at Eu
reka Valley, came Into thÂ«s room, when
he quietly sneaked out. .When he was
called for to state his cas?. he \fas not
on hand. He evidently did not want to

to communicate with the lodge in which
he claims his membership.

(ALL RIGHTS RESERVED). V\
- kly heart goes out to the woman who, Impressed with the necessity for
looking well after her health, becomes the victim of her own anxiety and ot
the medical theories advanced by her physicians.
The woman I mean is always going to the doctor and is never well.
She has a new trouble every day. and her family and friends think her
diseases are imaginary. Now she has X a pain In her chest, which she Is sure
is pleurisy; again she will have a backache, that can be traced to nothing
but kidney trouble. Another day her legs will ache and swell, and so on.
There never is a day that she hasn't some complaint, and usually It Is dif-
ferent from anything she ever had before. After a little no one sympa-
thizes with her. They make light of her complaints, and the poor woman,
who is really suffering and ill. leads a life of hopelessness and misery, iff
She gets no help from her doctor, because the actual troubles the woman ' *â¢
has are the, kind that doctors never cure. Tet ehe is forced to go to ths
doctor constantly for the aid she never gets. The doctors* bills are heavy,
the husband doesn't believe In her sickness, and after a while complains at
the heavy expense. How dreary Indeed Is life to this poor woman!
Of course, the new troubles that come to her every day areV really mani-
festations Of the same old trouble. They are merely symptoms. Shs haÂ« '
falling of the womb, and all her nervousness, her headaches, her bearing-
down sensations and her endless pain are caused by this one thing. She
has a sensitive organism^ which reflects through the nerves the womb de-
rangement. This makes it seem as though she had, so many different filg-
eases. â¢ ' '. â¢ â¢ â  . ' â 
In the beginning the medicine that would have saved her all the misery
is Lydla K. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound; It is the. one medicine now
that will help her. As sson as the strengthening influence of this famous
woman's remedy is felt, the nervous tension will relax and the distressing
sensationÂ«wUl disappear.
â¢ It will take longer to cure this woman than If she hadn't gone so many
years without the right treatment, but she can be cured by the same medi-
cine that has helped so many thousands of women. Whoever knows such a
poor, misunderstood sufferer will do her a good turn by calling her attention
to Mrs. Finkham's medicine.
With all its magnificent record !n the cure of these troubles, and the
widespread knowledge of its efficiency, it. is singular that any woman will
permit herself to disregard it and waste her life in this way. Perhaps the
greatest cruelty of all is for the Immediate family to say she Is not sick. I
know a case of this kind, and It is pitiful to see how tbe mother is mlsun*'y*
deretood by her children and her husband. No doubt a good many things |
that appear real to her are imaginary; the doctor tells the family that it is
nervousness and imagination, and so they, without any intention of being:
unkind. Ignore the complaints of suffering, thinking in this way she will get
over her troubles. V is hard, too, for the family; they are willing to do
what they can, but they think her mind unbalanced on this subject. *In time
df finite disease declares Itself, and probably by this time such headway has
been made that a hospital operation seems the only resource.
Some way must be found to make these conscientious women who want
to be well, and are taking so much trouble to be well, see that they need
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I wiM venture to say that every
woman who is being treated to-day for a great variety of troubles will find
them all disappear If she will get Mrs. Pinkham's advice and follow it. The
declaration of health Is unmistakable: imagining all kinds of diseases Is a
nervous state produced In woman invariably by female complaints. Doctors
do not expect women to be well, and their treatment encourages the belief
In woman's heritage of pain. This Is absolute error, and utterly contrary
to nature's plan. No woman knows this so thoroughly as Mrs. Pinkham, and
no advice is so kindly and convincing as hers.
Let. the woman who has the complicated troubles and the woman who
Is earnestly seeking for health get Mrs. Pinkham's free advice by writing to
her at Lynn, Mass. It Is the perfectly safe way to know the truth, and the
easiest way to secure right treatment. *

STRTE OBTAINS
HIGHEST HONOR
Excels All Competitors
at Pan-American
Display. ( \
Secretary Filcher Has Glow
ing Account of Results
Achieved.
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the State
Board of Trade, after an absence of nine
months In the East, the major portion of
which was spent at the Calif ornlan ex
hbllt at the Pan-American Exposition in
Buffalo, returned last nlrht, enthusiastic
ovir the results of the display, yet glad
to have escaped the rigors of the. Eastern
winter. . â  : \
Mr. Filcher brings joyful tidings to the
people of the State.' California earned
the highest recognition of any State In,
the United States and carlred off more
honors than .all the others combined.
Gold, silver and bronze, medals and certi
ficates of merit were awarded without
number, and the qomplete record Is a
wonderful tribute 'to the diversified in
dustries of the State. Mr. Filcher said:
. Everything was In our favor In Buffalo. We
Voccupled one-half the space In the big horti
cultural building-, besides having a space twelve
by thlrty>iwo feet In the mining building.
Every inch of space was used to the best pos
sible advantage and every industry was dis
played In the most attractive manner. ' We
had also, too, the advantage of location, for we
were on a -main passageway connecting two
of the most important buildings, and thousands
of people passed the exhibit dally.
Exhibit Great for State.
While 'the exhibit was a financial failure so
far as Us projectors ware uoncernsd. It ivu
an unqualified success from the standpoint of
California exhibitors. We had every day as
many visitors as we could handle, and the}
were of an inquiring, intelligent class that
seemed to have heard something of the re
sources of California, but were seeking fur
ther knowledge.
We adopted a new plan In the distribution of
literature. We had tons and tons of It from
all .parts of the State, and for the first time
the counties In the northern part of the State
seemed to rise to the occasion and sent twice
as many pamphlets as did the southern por
tion. We placed this on a large counter and
let the people help themselves. Instead of its
being thrown away, as has been the caaÂ«
when It was handed to them, we scarcely hail
to pick up a single piece. In one day we kept
account of the people that awkcil for literature
and we found that In one hour people repre
senting thirty-one States had registered. .Stw
York and Pennsylvania people were naturally
the greatest In number, but all sections of the
country were well represented.
>A. warded Many Medals.
Pome Idea of the results and the value of the
exhibit may be gained by the number of prizes
won by the State. Just look at this listâ forly
gold medals, fifty silver medals, flfty bronze
medals and hundreds of certificates of merit
were awarded our exhibitors. In variety and
quantity we exceeded every other State ex
hibit.
We had ecme little differences with tha
jurors. The California Fruit Canners' Asso
ciation erected, at its own expense, a "Palace
of Cans." Nine thousand cans containing all
kinds of fruit and vegetables comprised It.
and wii one of the features of the exhibition.
Yet this display only I received a minor men
tion. Eo it" was with our wines. We did not
think proper Justice was done to them and
made a protest to the Jury Â«i revision.
The jury on wines was composed of a repre
sentative of Chile, Mexico. France, Canada and
the United States and. as thes* first countries,
named consider themselves great wine produc
ing countries the rrsult was unfavorable to
California. Then the committee on revision
was composed of one representative from each
country maintaining .an exhibit. The South
American republics outbalanced all other coun
tries on the grand jury and It was therefore
difficult to alter the verdict of the petty Juries.
Dairymen Gain Honors.
For the first time at an exposition with which
I have had connection, the dairy Interests of
the State were represented and a most grati
fying showing was made. Butter In all kinds
cf packaged, cheese, and other dairy products
were exhibited, and the result was that this
portion of the exhibit secured two gold, five
silver and five bronze medals. *
Our lumber Interests were a1*o well repre
sented, and I may Instance one single result
that speaks volumes. The Tonawanda Lumber
Company. located on the Oreat Lakes between
Nlajrara and Buffalo, controls the lumber In
terests of that section. We succeeded In get
ting them Interested In our redwood and sugar
pine. Mr. Tewksbury. treasurer of the asso
ciation, told me that with what the company
had already received and with what wan now
on the road, they had bought 140 carloads, and
the demand was increasing every day.
Our prone kitchen was another great success.
We gave demonstrations of the best methods
of cooking California prunes, distributed 15/0)
copies of approved receipts and. created a de
mand for our prune* that was evidenced by a
ranviM made In Buffalo, where grocers Inform
ed us their rales had Increased from 50 to 100
per cent.
Part of the exhibit was disposed of In
New York. Dart is on its way to San
Francisco and another portion was sent
to St. I>ouls. where It is hoped It will
again be exhibited In 1903. The expense
of the exhibit, which promises so much
good to the State, will probably be leas
than $10,000, of which the Southern Pa
cific Company will bear 60 per cent and
the State Board of Trade the remainder.
MUCH RED TAPE IN .THE
BOARD, OF PUBLIC WORKS
Carpenter's Demand Goes to Seven
teen Different Officials Before It
la Finally Faid.
The red tape under which the Board of
Public Works el operated Is illustrated In
the case of a carpenter who may be em
ployed to do a day's work on a public
Echool building at the rate of $3 50 per
diem. After the carpenter has done hlx
work his demand passes through the
hands of no less than seventeen officials
before he receives his money.
As soon as the demand is made out It
is handed to the inspector of building*.
who affixes his signature thereto. He in
turn dispatches It to the superintendent
of buildings, who also signs It. The de
mand -finally reaches, and is signed In
succession by the secretary of the Board
of Public Works, the three Commission
era of the Board of Public Works, the
four members of the Board of Education
and tho secretary of the Board of Educa
tion.
The demand then comes before the
meeting of the Board of Education and
the secretary states it was ordered paid.
It is then examined and approved in turn
by the president of the Board of Edu
cation and the Superintendent of Schools
or by his deputy. 'Then it Is audited by
the Auditor or his deputy, and after it
is signed by the . City Treasurer . It Is
finally liquidated and the patient carpen
ter receives his $3 50. which took one dny
to earn and about six days to make the
demand negotiable.
The peculiar part of the proceedings is
that the only .man who knows whether
the work was performed by tho
carpenter does not sign the demand, and
he is the foreman who supervises the Job.

POLICE ARREST
A TILL "TRAPPER"
He and His Confederates
Bob a Fruit
Dealer.
Is Detected in Crime | by
/ 'Customer and Caught
After Chase.
One of the trio of young men who have
been systematically robbing storekeepers
is "under arrest. His name is Charles Wil
liams. He was captured yesterday after
noon by Charles Devoto. a . young man
whose father was cleverly robbed by Wll r
liams and his companions,
j Shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon Williams, who is a -well dressed
young fellow, visited A. Devoto's fruit
store at Powell and Green streets and
asked the proprietor to direct him to the
Fishermen's Wharf. Devoto stepped out
of his store and showed the stranger the
nearest way to reach the wharf..
After profusely thanking Devoto Wil
liams left. As Devoto returned to the
store he was told by a customer who had
entered the place while he was conversing
with the well-dressed stranger thai
he had seen a short man walk behind the
counter and take the contents of. the cash
drawer, amounting to JB. Calling his son
Devoto rushed outside and saw the stran
ger who had spoken to him run down
Powell street, followed by the thief who
had robbed the cash drawer and another
man. Young Devoto gave chase and after
running several blocks finally overhauled
the criminal. Devoto held him until Ser
geant Christiansen arrived. He was then
handcuffed and taken to the City Prison,
where his name was entered in the
."small" book. Ills companions were, not
arrÂ«!Sted. /
' During the past two weeks over a dozen
storekeepers have been robbed in a sim
ilar manner by the trio of crooks. To
day their victims will visit the City
Prison and endeavor to Identify the pris
oner. â¢ â

Nczv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. SO.â Amalgamated Cop
per chare* mw further vicissitudes to-day and
maintained their Influence on the general mar
ket. The raw copper market* abroad were re
ported Quieter to-day, after yesterday's enor
mous liquidation, and Amalgamated starteJ up
heie. reaching a point above last night's close.
This had a revivifying effect an the long list
and an upward movement began here and
there. These were among the Coalers, hard
and soft; Loutsville and Manhattan. Sugar
was marked up over a point. Then Amalga
mated Copper resumed He recent occupation
ct making new low records and touched 7: ! i
In the couise of the, morning. Very circum
ktantlal assertions were made that large nits
ot copper bad teen contracted for on behalf
of the company at prices materially below the
list price. No official admission of the as?rr
tlons could be secured. Bears covered in the
stock at the decline and It closed at 74H. a net
decline of a point. Brooklyn Rapid Transit
was another iwlnt of acute weakness, with a
Iocs of. nearly 4 points on account of the de
crease In October net earnings caused by the
Increase In operating expense*. The whole
market gave way. led by thwe two stocks,
when the bank, statement appeared. The In
crease in loans and the consequent Increase In
deposits resulted In reducing the surplus over
a million dollars by reason of expanded margin
of requirements. The nrmoru vt foreign cx
chance makee further experts of gold next
weÂ»k Increasingly problcmatic&l. 'ihe final
covering by room shorts made the closing
|riicrÂ« materially better and tba market doted
active and Crts.
Tbc movelbent of prices during the week baa
been somewhat irregular and hesitating and
the promise of. a vigorous .upward movement
has not been realized. There tut>e been srong
spots in the list and only a lew stocks have
suffered marked losses, but the market has
shown the effect to some extent of a recruues
cence of uneasiness over the possible year-end
development* in the 'money market. There
has been realizing- here and there on the pub
lication of anticipated good news and Mwne
selling by disappointed holders over the fail
ure 01 expected rood news to materialize. The
delayed meeting of Vanderbilt railroad direc
tors did not bring the hoped-for announce
ments of the "deal,", of which there baa been
vasue talk lor weeks, and autne of the mem
bers of the sroap suffered in consequence.
Others advanced further and the deirand for
New Tork Central has been continued con
fident on all recessions. Tbe violent and er
ratic fluctuations in Amalgamated Copper have
been Â«another disturbing Influence. This ftock
rallied sharply oa Monday morning on the de
nial of last Saturday's reports that papers
were preparing against the company In the
Atfbrney General's office In Washington, .but
the opening price. on Monday proved to be the
highest of thÂ« week, and heavy offerings â¢ of
the Â«harÂ«Â« have been a feature of the market.
Rumors of a rotntng cut In tbe pric* of copyor
h<re and another vtoUnt break Id tha price of
the metal In London have accompanied the de.
rllne In vplt* of the dentals of the intention
to reduce prices In New York. There tave
been frequent reports of plans formulating fur
Federal Â»t*ps asalntt the great consolidation!*
of capital, including tbe Northern Securities
<;orni*rjf. The probable attitude to be taken
by President Kooaevelt on this subject In his
rnwtp to Congress has hem much canvassed.
It km accepted as a forecone conclusion that
adtatlon on thÂ«s sub)Â«ct will have a promi
nent place In the proceedings of the coming
sfision of Conrre*c. .stock* of Industrial com
binations outfMe of Amalgamated Copper have
been tittle aflecteO, owing to counteracting in.
fluence*. Thus Sugar h&s con* up on the hope
of a reduction or abolition of duties .on raw
Â«|tr from Cuba and the n-w Island ' posses
sion *. Tbe downward course In the foreign **-
change market, which set in late last week.
ha* given place to a sharp recovery, and led
to renewed anxiety over possible gold ex
ports. It appears that New York borrowed In
Paris to some extent during the week, which
helped to ease the market early In the week.
ThÂ« pressure for gold at Paris has obviously
relaxed, hut the price of gold Is advancing
aÂ«atn rn London. If th* Bank of England de
elpes to attract cold In preparation for the
yearly settlements there Is a probability that
it will be able to do so.
There hat been a good demand for bonds
and a rather Irregular price movement. In
United States bonds the new 4s advanced >4

The Financier says: The cash in the banks
will probably bÂ« augmented during the
current week by the receipt from Son
Francisco of anaay office checks repre
senting Australian gold which arrived . at
that port last week. It Is quite possible, how
ever, that the consignees of. this gold, which
consisted of sovereigns, may have ordered the
transfet hither of a portion of the metal by ths
fast mall train with a. vu-w to its shipment to
Europe by the steamers aalling farly In Â«hÂ«
week. In such case the amount exported would
not count as a lots to the banks, It practically
being gold In transit. The comparatively small
gain to the banks Ust week on the Intel lor
movement of money does not scarcely Imply
that the return flow of currency has been ma
terially checked and It Is believed still to be in
progress from the Weat. It la aald. however, to
bf> too early to look for a movement in volume
from .the South and the- fact that 1389,000 was
transferred to New. Orleans during the week
would Kcm to Indicate that money Is In de
mand, at that' c>Dter for cotton . and perhaps
for sugar. . â¢ , ... .> V -
The. hank Mtatcrnent was more or less de
ranged through th<s Intervention 'of thÂ« Thanks
giving holiday. It seems likely, therefore, that
tha return may have been made up on rl*lng
averages for cash, reneetlns; Friday's receipts
from the Interior. â¢ â¢ â¢ . . . â¢ .
The statement as a whotn neems to Indicate
fairly easy money rates at this center in the
Immediate future. . â  . .

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Firmness characterized the foreign
markets' and' Paris and Liverpool futures were
higher. -
Chicago was active at an advance, but sell
ers predominated, particularly., in {December.
The coarse grains were easier and the spot de
mand was less urgent. The tendency In Wheat
was upward, In consequence of the general con
fidence In prices. JVlrea to Bolton, De Ruyter
A Co. said that Northwestern stocks Increased
during the week about 1.600.0CO bushels, and
that another large increase In the visible sup
ply Is expected to-morrow. Great Britain and
the Continent both report extenalve feeding of
Wheat to stock. The strength In Wheat Is
largely sympathetic with the - firmness ' in
coarse grains. Minneapolis stocks Increased
1.1S9.S0O bushels, and Duluth stocks GOO.CCO
bushels during- the week. Speculation at Chi
cairo was fairly active.
This market was fractionally higher, both on
and off call.

Chicago opened' with a sharp advance, but
the market weakened and fell back. Outsid?
spÂ«^ulatlve trade forms the chief nuonort of
the market, and the packers are the principal
tellers, mÂ»lnly of accumulating uroducts. It
looks aÂ» If the packers were giving quotations
a boost to enable them to work off their ac
cumulated ctcck.
Th-* San Francisco branch of a Chicago
nova* has been notified to mark up Ham:-.
Hacon tnd Lard Vic to-morrow and will do so.
The advance will not be general, however, as
njost 6f the other local bouses da not sse their
way to make an advance Just now. though
they say that they will probably have to come
to It before lone, as the feeling Is very firm,

CAR SHORTAGE
CAUSES TROUBLE
California Oil Men Find
More Barriera to
Progress.
Beaumont Gushers Begin to
Show Signs of Di- I
xninishing. v
The shortage of the tank cars In which
to market the output of California wells
continues, and there is grumbling all
along the line. There are rumors that the
curs of the Union Tank Line will be
taken from the coast service and re
turned to the East. The newspapers pub
lished near the oil lields say that there
is no indication of any relief in sight.
U he situation In California is unique.
The general drift of testimony is to the
effect that the flow of the Beaumont
gushers is diminishing:. The prices for
the Texas product are very low, and the
demoralization of the Texas oil men U
worse than that of the producers of Cali
fornia. Oil from Beaumont is sold in
large quantities for 10 cents per barrel,
and lots have been sold as low as 2Vi
cents per barrel. A combination has been
formed, according to report, to acquire
all the Spindleton properties. Some time
ago it was impossible to get land upon
which to drill a well for less than $20,000.
Recently a sale was made for $$000. ,
The Bakerstlcld Calif ornian says:
Several of the operators of the Kern country
are looking toward the Wyoming and other in
terior oil fields with longing eyes and many
have exDressed their Intention of visiting the
new fields. A well-known man, who has re
ceived letters direct Irom Fossil, stated to-day
that there is no possible chance for money to
be made in that field excepting through stocks,
and this is v very uncertain, us the local con
sumption cannot be suftlclent to warrant any
great boom from this source. The lands have
been taken up for miles surrounding the strike
by corporations similar to the Clark syndicate,
and there is said to be absolutely no opportu
nity such as Is usually found In a new min
eral strike. - â  .
Much has been said of the fields In relation
to their future. If oil Is struck in quantities,
how can it be handled consistently? It has no
outlet other than through the railroads, and
the rates of transportation are said to be ex
orbitant and the extent of the strikes have
not been determined. These questions, which
are being freely discussed by oil men, are
causing them to think twice before leaving
their interests in the California fields for tbe
uncertainties of another.
Beady to Operate.
The spur of the Sunset Railroad to the
refinery at Sunset City has been com
pleted and the people at that place are
looking for more lively times.
Three companies in Colusa County
claim to have struck oil. These are the
Colusa County Oil Company, which re
ports its find to the Arbucklo Indepen
dent, and the Orr & Mercale and Corning
OH and Gas companies. The amount of
oil is still indefinite. The Corning Com
pany's well Is reported down 2000 feet.
A picture of the conditions under which
marketing of oil In the Kern River dis
trict is proceeding, in the absence of any
working combination, is derived from the
following:, which appears in the Bakers
field Calif ornian: â¢ .
All development work on the holdings of the
Minnehoha Oli Company will be stopped until
the oil marketing problem Is settled and the
car shortage is adjusted. Mr. Durkee Is one of
the operators who Is not willing to produce oil
and sell It to the Standard at fifteen cent*,
with a reduction of two and a half cents per
barrel for water and sand.
* Work at Tejunga.
The Los Angeles Herald reports that
there are now three companies operating
in the Tejunga country. It says:
The Tejunga Oil Company bat a 'well down
350 feet, the Denver Oil Company has drilled to
a depth of MO feet and the Russian Oil Com
pany, operating on ti, 3-14, has attained a
depth of 1000 feet with the well It has been
drilling.
The oil that has been - obtained â¢ In small
quantities Is a rich, light â¢green oil, similar
In character to that being produced In Pico
Canyon. It is contended that these three com
panies are operating on the main lode, which
runs from Newhall up Into the mountains, and
as the expert who located the wells being
drilled was the same who laid out those At
Pico Canyon It may be â  that this- will prove
correct. The Bard .Oil Company, with' which
Senator Bard Is ldentlfled,- hold* 1200 acres, and
the Pacific Coast Oil Company also has a large
holding, and In addition to these are a num
ber of ether companies of lesser Importance.

NOME GRAFT ARCTIC SWINGS INTO
BARK EDMOND ROSTAND IN FOG
No Lives Are Lost and Neither Vessel Is Seriously Damaged, but
the Rostand May Go on the Drydock for'an OverhaulingâShip
Santa; Clara Is Picked Up in the: Mist and Towed Into Port
FOG on. the bay was "as thick as
mush" yesterday and last even-
Ins It was almost Impossible to
see a boat's length. â¢ '
The steam schooner "Arctic ran
down the French bark Edmond Rostand
Jn the early morning hours, while the En
clnal and Albatross came together in the
fog. Many a vessel had a narrow escape
and the fog signals were blown In all di
rections, from Hunters Point to the Mer
chants' Exchange outlook station at Point
Lobos. ., j
During the day the ferry-boat Tiburon
had. to make a second attempt at her first
landing. The Enclnal was nearly half an
hour reaching her slip, and the Piedmont
had a similar experience.
â â  The Oakland and the San Rafael came
very near colliding when they reached
this city at 5 o'clock in the evening. Each
boat missed her slip, one going too high
and the other too low.
The Klmball Steamship Company's Arc
tic arrived from Nome and way ports
early In the morning. On her way down
the coast she stopped at Astoria, and
after leaving the Columbia River waÂ»
caught in the southeaster and had a very
rough experience. Making port in the fog,
Captain. Erickson decided that it was bet
ter to come to an anchor. The Arctic
was accordingly hove to and the anchor
dropped. When she swung with the tide,
however, she was right under the quarter
of the French bark Edmond Rostand.v The
latter was raked and the Arctic suffered
considerably about her upper works and
rigging, but apart from that she Is as
sound as a dollar. The Rostand may have
to be sent to the drydock for an overhaul
ing. . â¢ '
During the midday hours the fog lifted
and ferry boats and tugs had a chance
to save steam. That Is. they did not have
to blow a warning blast every minute.
At 5 p. m. the mist settled down again,
however, and hardly a ferry boat on the
regular run made time. The broad gauge
boats made the narrow gauge slip and the
Tiburon boat' made Sausallto, while Cap
tain McKenzle, for the first time In his
life, went on the wrong side of Alcatrar.
STEALS GASOLINE LAUNCH.
Harry Baldwin. Accused of Taking
Small Vessel.
A man who gives his name as Harry
Baldwin is wanted at the Harbor police
station on a charge of .grand larceny. He
is accused of stealing a gasoline launch,
but his friends deny every accusation.
It was only two weeks agouhat Baldwin
left here as Goodrich, but landed in
Stockton under, his original name. . Un
dV that cognomen he traveled the county
over and finally made arrangements with
Hugh McDade td purchase the gasoline
launch Gazelle. The boat happened to
be on the Mokelumne River. In charge of
George Peters. It was a long way there
from Stockton, but Baldwin succeeded In
making the journey and also secured
possession of the launch. Since then he
has been having a splendid time on the
river, and many a riverside Inn regrets
his call.
McDade has been chasing the launch
by telephone and telegraph ever since
she disappeared, but to-day was the first
occasion on which he got any trace of
her. The Gazello Is on the water front,
but ber owner will. have to Identify her.
Towed Into Port.
The Alaska Packers' Association's
Bantn Clara was towed into port yester-'
day by the steam schooner Iaqua. The
latter vessel -was on her â¢way down the
coast and heard the fog signals from the
ship. The latter was anxious to make
port, as she had the last of the season's
catchâ 48,368 cases. and 142 barrelsâ aboard
and vessels In the bay were waiting for
the consignments. In consequence Cap
tain Llndburg was more than anxious
to make port. Not a towboat could .be
Been In the offing, and when the Iaqua
came' along it did not take long to make
a bargain over the price of a tow. The
Santa Clara came In without any trouble
and 1 docked at the company's wharf be
fore even ' the agents knew she was In
port. ji
The Santa Clara made m quick run down
the coast and was off the lightship on
November 27. She was driven off in tho
southeaster and only made Bollnas yes
terday morning. .
Derelict Skiff Picked Up..
Guisseppo Bozzard, a Portuguese fish
erman, found a flat-bottomed red skiff
In the oecan a short distance south of
the Cliff House and towed it to the foot
of Union street, where the skiff awaits
its owner. There was nothing about the
craft by which It could be ldentlfled.

CABLE TO TAKE
COPPER SURPLUS
Coast Producers Greatly
-Interested in New
Enterprise.
Discoveries of Good Promise
Are Reported on the.
Mother Lode.
An authority, summing up the copper
situation, finds that the copper exports
from the United States during the first
ten months of the present year were 137,
083,000 pounds smaller than for the cor
responding period tn 1900. In fact they
have been smaller this year than at any
corresponding period in five years. Eng
lish 'copper consumption has been 8,796.480
pounds less for the described period than
It was last year for the same month*.
England has been getting - more copper
this year from Chile, Mexico, Peru and
Japan than it received from those sources
last year. The combined consumption of
the countries of Europe shows a falling
off for the year 1301. The American Min
ing News says: - ]
It is a fact that England has Imported less
copper from all sources from - January 1 to
November 1 this year than It did between
these dates last year. In only one respect does
English trade In copper show an Increase this
year, and that la In the exports from that
country. For the first nine months of 1301
these exports made a total of S9.578 tons, as
against 54,633 tons in the same period In IOool
The Imports of copper Into England during the
first nine months of this year were 110,433 tons,
so that It Is seen that England re-exports fully
as much copper as It consumes, and this branca
of the English capper trade continues to b*
an Important . factor. . ' . . . *
England and South Wales received during the
first ten months of this year 108,473 tons at
copper, of which only 17,078 tons were from the
United States. Australia sent 1S.3T0 tons, or
within 108 tons as much as this country; Japan.
6107 tons: Mexico. 6S83 tons; Spain. 20,189 tona;
Peru, 7S71 tons; Cape of Good Hope. 7724 tons,
and Chile. 19,537 tons. The Imports Into Eng
land and South Wales from this country this
year have decreased 10,433 tons, while those
from Chile have Increased 3468 tons. * Other
Increases were from Japan, Australia" Peru
and Cape of Good Hope. English Imports of
copper from Spain show a decrease of 1403 tons.
The figures show Imports of copper Into Eng
lish ports from countries other than the United
States of 13,719 tons more than the total Ameri
can copper exports for the first ten months of
this year.
Cable Will Lessen Surplus.
It is of interest to note in this connec
tion that the new cable to cross the Pa
cine Ocean, which will place San Fran-
Cisco in touch with the Far East, Is ex
pected to take up alone half of the pres
ent surplus copper of the United MeUUs
Selling Company. There will be a local
demand for copper. In which the miners
of California are particularly concerned.
The Yreka Journal says that very rich
quartz prospects have been found in Sis
kiyou County In Portuguese Gulch, a
tributary of Humbug Creek on Yreka
Flata. The quartz is in small pockets and
a continuous ledge haa been discovered.
Jesse Grant is superintending the work
on the quartz ledge at the Myers place at
Greenhorn Gulch. A mill Is about ready
to work there. According to the Randa
burg Miner the Barstow mill has resumed
operations and has ore In sight to keep
it running for some time. The Phoenix
mine has ordered a stamp mill which will
soon be running. The Phoenix is near
Johannesburg.
Two groups of copper claims In the
Waldo district, on Hauch Mountain, have
according to the Oregon Mining Journal
been bonded to R. B. Whlteslde of Du
luth. Minn., for J100.000. Whlteside i*as
two shifts of men at work developing the
property. The owners *ro Dr. J. Spence
and Cass Brothers. The Continental Cop
per mine in Myrtle Creek district has
been sold to Seattle parties.
Minerals for Schools.
The following has been Issued from thÂ«
State Mining Bureau:
Mineralogist Anbury Is seeking to eneourag*
the study of mineralogy In the advanced
grades of the public schools of the State, and
with this end In view haa opened correspond
ence with a number of our educators In an
endeavor to promote a more general knowl
edge of the mineral products of California. As
a means of a, practical education on thts sub
ject he Is making a number of collections of,
the common minerals and ores, and after they
have been properly labeled hÂ« will forward
them to the various high schools In this Stats
where they have manifested an Interest In this
study. Already many collections have been
donated from duplicate samples on hand. ThÂ»
only charges made for these collections are for
transportation. '
The San Diego Union publishes a story
that immense deposits of Iron have been
discovered In Mexico, near Todos Santos
Bay. â  ,
The preliminary -work necessary for all
winter mining, so says the Scott Valley
Advance, has been about concluded In
Slsklyou County and the miners are wait
ing for water. Work on the dredger at
Callahan Is progressing very satisfactor
ily. There is water enough for many of
the placer mines to resume at once. A
ledge has been discovered about one mile
from Etna, which has been located by
E. J. Plckel and M. J. Cummlngs.
Charles Rasberry has discovered an as
bestos mine not far from Angels Camp.
Calaveras County, about seven miles east
from Copperopolis, on the old Rawhide
ferry road. â¢ '
The Redding Free Press says that the
Liberty group of copper claims, west from
Copley, Shasta County, baa been bonded
to St. Louis parties for a large sum.
The Mother Lode Banner reports that
the Eagle-Shawmut mine has resumed op
erations: that water is now supplied to>
the Dead Horse. Free Lance and other
mines on the same line as the Shawmut
and that a good body of ore haa been
discovered by tbe Mohican Mining Com
pany near the mouth of the North Fork
of the Tuolumne River.
The Redding Searchlight says that s
smelter may be put up at the Donkey
mine in the Furnacevllle district. Shasta
County, near the Afterthought property.
A bond was recently taken on the prop
erty for S. D- Morgan of Oakland. Ha
says that he ' thinks of establishing a
smelter, the capacity to be a forty to fifty
Â°The Amador Record says that what
promises to be one of the richest pros
pects ever discovered In Amador County
has just been uncovered on the Orr ranch,
north of the town of Plymouth, Crop
pings 200 feet long have been brought to
view, Taryteal In width from SH to Â« feet,
in the bed of Indian Creek, with a pay
shoot that Is very rich In free gold. : .
Half a dozen claims of gold and copper
have been located In Sonora. Northern
Mexico, by the Sierra Madre Mining Com
pany, which has an office in this. city.
According to the reports sent out tha
Providentla copper mine is very rich. Tha
Los Amlgos gold mine, owned by the same
company, and reported to be rich. Is In
the same country. This is an ancient mine
that wsa abandoned by the Spaniards
many years ago and has been relocated.
Railroads are projected to develop tha
country, which was long held back by thÂ«
hostility of the Yaqul Indians. â  '
P. E. Bailey, field assistant of the Stats
Mining Bureau, la In Death Valley, and
has besrun to Investigate into the extent
of the deposits of nitrates and- borax In
that section. A mineral map and regis
ter cf itake County will be published by
the State Mlneraloarist this month. Maps
and registers of El Dorado, Inyo and
Amador counties will soon be prepared.
The Marlposa Gazette says: . ... â 
The Washington mine at Hornltos .was
opened 1400 feet on the Incline and Is situated
1000 feet above the tea level, therefore the
mine was say 250 lower than San Francisco
Bay. Princeton mine Is now 1350 fset deep and
Is situated 2000 feet above sea level and there
fore must be now about as deep aa tha top of
the Washington mine. So Princeton must be
sunk about 1250 feet deeper to reach the Sam*
depth as tbe first I above named . mine, com
pared to the sea level. The lowest workings
In Hltea Cove are now about 1700 feet above
sea level and . la nevertheless above thÂ« crass
roots of HI ten Cove. Mount Raymond's lead
and stiver mines are the highest mines oper
ated In the county, being about (000 feet above*
sea level. The McFarland mine above Raael
Green Is about thÂ« same altitude. It being a .
* old mine. Tbe lower* wlnÂ» Tn thÂ« county Is
the Coo* mine below Hornltos. The Copper j
Belt In White Hock varies from 750 to ISO
feet above sea level. Some day . when many
mines have been developed It may bÂ« of Inter
est tn know such facts as these and to know .
the. history nf the shoots and grade of values/
at varying depths. ââ .. - * . . ..
