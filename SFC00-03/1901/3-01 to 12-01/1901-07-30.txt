"""After "more than an. hotir's conference
It was. agreed -that Mayor Phelan should
"go. before i representatives of the Employ
ers" Association at Attorney Michael's of
fice and give them whatever Information
he had gained as to the present attitude
of the teamsters and other union men af
fected. It was agreed further that those
present at the conference should meet
again at Mayor Phelan'a private office in
the Phelan building at 6 o'clock to learn
the results of the Mayor's conference with
the employers.
Furuseth, Casey and McLaughlln left
the meeting very much discouraged and
evidently convinced that no hope remain
ed of concessions on the part of the em
ployers.
"It is not the unions," Furuseth said
afterward, "that are bringing this upon
the city. The employers ignore us entire
ly. They say to the Individual workman,
â¢You* 1 may come back to work under the
old conditions.' But as for the unions,
they will not recognize our committees or
delegates or agents. They are willing to
give the individual employment, but they
are determined to crush the unions. They
had no representatives at this afternoon's
meeting in the Mayor's office, and of
course there could . be no results."
Mayor Phelan having conferred with
the members of the Employers* Associa
tion again met the committee of the Mun
icipal League in- his office in the Phelan
building at 6 o'clock, when he submitted
the following report:
' I had a conference with the board of
directors of the Employers' Associa
tion, at which they delivered to me the
letter of their attorney, dated July 29,
as follows: ;'>Â¦-'
"SAN FRANCISCO, July 29, 1901.
"Hon. James D. Phelan, New City
Hail, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: The
proposition for a settlement of the
present trouble between the Dray
men's Association and the Brother
hood of Teamsters submitted by you
to the Employers' Association for their
good offices In* this regard has received
the careful consideration demanded by
the nature of the trouble and the im
portance of the Interests at stake.
"I am instructed by the ex
ecutive committee of the Em
ployers' Association to advise
yon that the proposition than
submitted appears to the aÂ»no
ciatlon not to present a satisfac
tory solution of the present dif
ficulties; furthermore, that the
association is of the opinion that
an agreement in the shape pro
poned could not be adequately
maintained or enforced.
"In response to your request for a
suggestion from the association as to
1 what may serve to overcome the pres
ent difficulties, already so serious to
the employer and threatening disas
ter to the community, I am Instructed
to say that the policy and determina
tion of this association is to 'live and
let live.' Its declaration of principles
contains among other things the fol
lowing:
"We recojrnlxe . the right of
labor to organise to ameliorate
its conditions, and ire, as em
ployers, ' will not trespass upon
that right by ref using employ
ment to any one solely because
- he does or does not belong to
any labor organization) and vre
also denounce any coercion on
the part of any employer where
by employes . are compelled
pressat. Discussion lasted until 3:30
o'clock, but to little purpose, as no one
had authority to speak for the employ
ers.
The- labor leaders present explained that
the teamsters demanded that they be al
lowed to go back to work under the con
ditions that existed before the lockout.
In the- way of concession they,would agree
that In future no sympathetic strikes
should be declared until the questions at
issue should first be submitted to a con
ciliation board of three. They would not
consent to- surrender the right to declare
sympathetic strikes whenever such arbi
tration should faiU . -
THE Industrial Conciliation
Committee of the Municipal
League made strenuous efforts
yesterday to avert the threat
ened strike, but without avail.
Two meetings were held in ths
course of the day. One in the after
noon at the Mayor's office in the City
Hall and another at 6 o'clock iu
Mayor Phelan's private office in the
Pitslan building.
Labor leaders were present at both
meetings, but the Employers' Asso
ciation was not represented. At the
second meeting a statement from the
Employers' Association's attorney
embodied in a report by Mayor Plie
lan was read and approved by the
committee as the best it had to offer
to the dissatisfied workingmen. No
concessions to the strikers and other
union men interested were contained
in it and at the meetings of the City
Front Federation and unions at
night the report did not receive seri
cus consideration. â¢
The committee met at Mayor Phelan's
office at 2 o'clock. Michael- Casey;

o'clock yesterday afternoon at the
offices of the ; Panama Railroad
and Steamship Company to con
sider steps to protect the members of the
association to the event of their important
interests being placed in jeopardy by a
strike .of longshoremen, firemen and other
employes that recognize the authority . of
the City Front Federation. A meeting of
members of -the association will be held
,at 3 o'clock this afternoon and a definite
policy will doubtless be adopted. â¢
There were present at the meeting yes
terday the following: R. P. Schwerin,
president; F. F. Connor, secretary; John
D. Spreckels, Captain Goodall and E. R.
Dlmond.
Various matters pertaining to the labor
situation were discussed, and the effects
and best methods of meeting a strike of
their, employes were considered. The en
tire matter, however, was left open pend
ing the meeting of the City Front Federa
tion and its action.
The directors were a unit In determina
tion that if a strike were ordered the
steamship managers should go into the
contest to fight to the finish. The con
sensus . of opinion was that ocean-going
vessels could be moved in spite of a strike
of the unions affiliated with the City
Front Federation, and that owners would
make every exertion to send their ves
\ sels out on scheduled sailing dates.
"The members of the Steamship Man
agers' Association," F. F. Connor. Its
secretary, said after the meeting, "are
riot members of the Employers' Associa
tion. . They are innocent of any connec
tion with the teamsters' strike and their
employes have, no grievances that are
causing them to strike. In view of this
1Â£ their longshoremen, firemen and other
employes go-out in a sympathetic stride
.to 'aid' the teamsters andi porters and
packers, the' managers as a unit will re
gard It as a breach of good faith, and in
.-the end the striking laborers will have
.to '', make; good/ dollar for dollar, out of
their ".wages all of the. loss they inflict
upon L> their . employers. If the .'.< fight Is
forced upon us it will be a fight to the
finish."' ': Â¦ . . . ' â¢ â¢ ;; ;.-; ,
THE City Front Federation at
its meeting last night ordered
a general strike on the docks
of San Francisco, Oakland,
Mission Bock and Port Costa
and in the city of San Francisco, to
gt> into effect this morning'. The
ection of the Federation was prompt
ly ratified amid great enthusiasm by
those unions most directly interested,
and sailors, longshoremen, firemen,
porters and packers, ship clerks and
ether men whose unions are affiliated
"with the organization which took the
initiative Vill not report for work
this morning.
The tie-up will be complete if the
plans of the labor unions are success
ful. They hope to stop the loading
end even to prevent the moving of
chips that are now almost ready for
departure. Unless the proprietors
and managers are able to secure suf
ficient non-union help to load and
man their vessels, the strike will
practically mean the closing of the
port and the suspension of business
in the wholesale and manufacturing
section of San Francisco and Oak
land.
The ferryboats are not affected by
the strike. Union men employed on
them will not be called out, and local
travel and freight transfer 'will not
be disturbed.
The membership of the unions af
fected exceeds 16,000 men. N"ot
that many are employed at all times
but the total number that will b?
cut of employment as the result of
the action of the City Front Federa
tion will not be far from 15,000.
The decision reached by the Federation
was not arrived at until nearly midnight
and then only after long discussion over
a plan of conciliation presented tothrrn.
The final result, however, was at no time
In doubt, for the employers had made no
advances and offered no concessions wor
thy of the name so far as the point of
view of the workingmen was concerned,
and the discussion was not so much on
the central fact of calling out the men on
the docks as on the Cetalls of the pro
posed strike. The proposition to include
Sacramento and Benida was rejected
upon the ground that the war was against
San Francisco employers alone. The
adoption of the resolution declaring the
Btrike was received with enthusiastic
cheers by the delegates' present. The vote
was unanimous, not a delegate from any
union uttering: a protest. Immediately
upon the decision being reached the meet
ing broke up and delegates hurried to
their own unions, where large gatherings
waited Impatiently the news of the. action
of the central body. In each of theseâ the
Bailors' Union, the four Longshoremen's
"Locals" and teamsters in particular â
the announcement of the action of the
Federation was a signal for prolonged
cheering. In all of them ratification of
the action was a foregone conclusion, and
was practically unanimous everywhere.
The following statement of its side of
the case was given to the press by the
City Front Federation:
The City Front Federation was or
ganized for the purpose of bringing
about closer affiliation among the
different organizations connected with
the shipping of this port with the view
of reaching better and more amicable
relations between the employers . and
employes directly interested In the ma
rine transportation of San Francisco.
This policy of the federation has been
strictly adhered to, and it has been in
strumental in preserving peace, where
a less conservative -course would un
doubtedly have precipitated strikes
and disputes detrimental to San Fran
cisco. -;.., '.-'.'

The Employers' Association, com
posed of the principal Importing and
Jobbing concerns of this city, to whose
Interests it would be to destroy the
manufacturing industries of this State
and city, has stated that it would dis
rupt the labor organizations of this
city. They have tried with more or
lets success to destroy some of the
smaller organizations, and as their
minor successes give them confidence
they reached out further with the idea
that ultimately their plan would be
successful. The lockout of the team
sters and the circumstances which j
' brought it about have been through
ly explained in the dally press. The
federation knows that the draymen
are a very important factor in the
handling of freight for transportation,
more so here than in any other city .
in the United States, inasmuch as â¢

there are very few docks in this city
with railroad facilities. '..''..
In^view. of. the fact that the team
sters were locked out the Federation
found if absolutely "necessary to take
action True to its policy it instructed
its executivp'committee to use'its best
endeavors to amicably adjust the dif
ficulty between the teamsters and
their employers. The Draymen's As
sociation has stated that the difficulty
between them and the teamsters has
been taken out of their hands and any
settlement 'must ' come through the
Employers' 'Association, whose mem
bers are unknown. .. *
In this emergency the committee
waited upon the president of the
Steamship Managers' Association," the
president of the Chamber of Com
merce, the Mayor of this city, the
principal shipowners and others and
urged upon them to use their in
fluence to have the difficulty ad
justed. It has exhausted all its means
to reach a peaceful settlement of the
difficulty and was not successful be

JACKSON DEFEATS HANDLER.
Colored Lad From California Makes
, Good Showing at Baltimore.
BALTIMORE, July 29.â "Young"' Peter
Jackson, the California colored lad, won
from "Jimmy" Handler ,of Newark, N.
J., to-night In the ninth : round of the
fiercest slugging match ever held in
Baltimore. The contest, which was to
have gone twenty rounds, was held at
Ford's Opera-house under the auspices
of the Eureka Athletic Club, with the
mercury in the neighborhood of 100. Both
men were in good condition, but Jackson
had the better of.- it in this- respect and
the fact won him the battle. Handler
ptarted the slugging as soon as the men
reached the center of the ring, keeping
it up all through the mill. He seemed to
be able to hit the negro when and where
he pleased and hit him hard at that, but
the Calif ornian took his punishment
gamely and stood up under it hand
somely. ' . : Â¦: -
Handler seemed to have the fight in
hand in the sixth round, but the gong
saved Peter and gave him another chance
and he fought warily during the seventh
and eighth rounds. Handler was still
punching hard and often when, just as
the ninth was about to end. Jackson
landed a vicious left swing on the white
boy's Jaw, sending him to the floor aha
setting htm . groggy. After this there
were some wild swings, with Handler
gasping and dazed, until the police 'Or

decided In Jackson's^ favor.

ation, a new Ministry being formed by
Marquis de Rudlni. In 1892 Crispi gave
up the leadership of the opposition, but
retained his Feat in the Chamber of
Deputies.
On the fall of the Glolottl Ministry
(who had succeeded Rudini) In Novem
ber, .1884, he was again called to the
Premiership. In the same year his gov
ernment by severe measures suppressed
the Socialist Corporation, of Italian work
era. In 1895 questions dealing with Italy's
relations with Brazil, England and
Austria had already aroused great pub
lic feeling, when the disastrous results |
attending the Government's policy In
Africa began to transpire, and when In
1896 Italy sustained her greatest defeat
of modern times at the hands of Menelik s
generals at Adowa and Abba Carlma, the
Cricpl Ministry fell at- once. At this
juncture Signor Crispi entered upon a
phase of public career which would have
finally extinguished politically a less able
statesman. In 1894 grave charges had
been presented against his integrity in
connection with some fraudulent trans
actions with the funds of the Banro
Romano, and in 1897 he was formally
tried by a commission from the Chamber
and declared not guilty. .
After this Slgnor Crispi retired from
active participation in national affairs,
though he wrote several articles on
political subjects which attracted much
attention. ~
STEERS BALLOON
OVER A COURSE
Aeronaut Dumont Makes
Another Successful
Ascension.
PARIS, July 29.â M. Santos-Dumont
made another successful experiment thi3 J
afternoon with a' dirigible balloon, sailing f
from St. Cloud to the Longchamps race- |
course, around which he steered the bal
loon and ascended and descended, occupy-.
Ing twenty minutes of time. Though ask-'
ed to make an attempt to go around the '
Eiffel Tower, the aeronaut declined, say
ing his motor was not yet working as well |
as he wanted. The weather was cloudy, j
which may*Â«nave influenced his decision.
During the trip M. Santos-Dumont cut
one of his J hands slightly, with a guide
rope. Otherwise there was no incident.
The crowd warmly cheered M. Santos-
Dumont at the start and on his descent
his friends crowded around him and
warmly congratulated him. upon his suc
cess. * . S99fej
The aeronaut started at 4:35 p. m. and
descended at 4:55 p.' m.
The exhibition, .though successful, was
disappointing in that he did not go around
the Eiffel- Tower, though he had an
nounced his Intention of attempting that
feat. Â¦
An hour later a, heavy rain squall swept
over the Eiffel Tower and the Bols, which
justified the prudence of M. Santos-Du
mont in declining to make a further as
cension to-day. 1 v
Â¦ When the- balloon was maneuvering
over the Longchamps racecourse smoke
was seen to be issuing from the motor,
which --M. Santos-Dumont said,, on -de
scending,- was due to a slight defect in the
apparatus. .He was : satisfied . he could
make the trip to the - Eiffel * Tower and
back; but apparently feared he would not
be able to obtain' sufficient speed to fulfill
the conditions of the Deutsche prize.

Lawton district. The first name brought
out for this district was that of James :R.
Woods of Weatherford, O. T., and the
crowd again went wild. This meant that
Woods would be able to claim the quar
ter section adjoining Lawton, one of the
choicest in the entire country.
"They Must Get Mr.rried."
The second ticket was drawn and
Colonel Dyer cried out: "I have the
pleasure to announce the , name of the
first .woman to draw a prize â Mattie "H.

Then Colonel Dyer gave her description

FRANCISCO CRISPI'S CABJBEB.
Soldier and Statesman Who Became
Italy's Grand Old Kan.
Francisco Crispi, soldier and statesman,
sometimes called the Grand Old Man of
Italy, was born at Rlbera, Sicily, October
4, 1S19, the same year wlfh the late Queen
Victoria. From the time he attained his
majority until within a year or two ago
he was actively engaged In public life,
a He was one of the founders of the New
Italy and afterward one of the foremost
In perfecting the system of government.
He studied law at Palermo and became a
member of the bar at Naples, where he
engaged â¢ in the conspiracies - that finally
led to the overthrow of the kingdom of
the Two Sicilies in 1848. He was one of
the chief promoters of the insurrection
of Palermo, became a deputy and Grand
Secretary of War, and for two year3 was
the head and heart of the resistance of
fered by the Sicilian people. ' On the vic
tory of the Swiss regiments he fled to
France.
In 1859 . and I860' he , organized- a new
Sicilian revolution, larioed at .Palermo
with Garibaldi and his volunteers and
after fighting as a simple soldier became
a Minister, in which capacity he paved
the â¢ way for the annexation of the Two
Sicilies to the kingdom of Italy.
In 1861 he was returned by the city of
Palermo to the first Italian Parliament
and was thenceforth connected with the
affairs of the nation. He took a most
prominent position and in a short time
became the acknowledged leader of the
Constitutional opposition. He. was very
popular and in 1876 was chosen as deputy
by several electorates at the same time
and was elected president of the Chamber
of Deputies by a vote of 232 to 115.
In 1877. "when, the return of the party
of "Moral Order" to power In France
menaced the interests of Italy. Crispi
visited â¢ London and Berlin in search of
allies and was well received in both
capitals. Soon after he became Minister
of the Interior in the Deputies Cabinet,
but retired after some months' service.
For the next ten years he was the leader

Italy more prominent in the concert of

There was no "change 1 in the position of
the contending forces to-day. J' No further
attempt was made to start the idle mills,

â¢American Tin Plate Company was mak
ing an effort , to start the Demmler plant
with non-union men and that one set of
rolls., Â¦was- being- operated Â¦was afterward
explained as being a rumor that started
from the fact that the company had some

expectation that the strike would be set

President Shaffer Remains Silent. ,
This, was a busy day for President Shaf

Amalgamated Association. There was a

on the proposed -settlement of the strike.
President Shaffer was firm in | his deter

tion 1 until after the meeting to-morrow.
' Colonel G. -Watson French and J.-Wash
ington Taylor of the Republic Iron and
Steel Company had a lengthy conference
with President Shaffer, but the object of
their call-was not "made public. It was
said, however, that it had no connection
with the strike settlement, but rather to
the /affairs of the .- Youngstown company.
It.was'said the Republic Company was in
need of -a number, of skilled men and In

French, Joseph Bishop, secretary of the

was in connection, with the strike and its

Strikers Hold Their Ground.
One of the most, apparent facts in the
status of the strike to-day was the deter
mination of the strikers to lose no ground
in their struggle while peace negotiations
are being conducted. The strikers claim
to have more than held their own ground
since the strike.began, and since the open-
Ing of the campaign they-claim to have
increased their membership'" In McKees

CHICAGO, July 29.â While the men and

carefully txeomXed attempt to rob the
residence of \& J. Davis, manager of the
Illinois Theater, at 4740 Grand boulevard,
early to-day was frustrated by the pres
ence of mind of his wife. Jessie Bartlstt
Davis, the noted opera singer, with her
sister. Josephine Bartlett of the Bos
tonian Opera Company, occupied a room
on the second floor. Davis was\ away
at the time. In the room next to that
occupied by the two women was a safe
with contents valued at $30,000. The door
to the latter room was unlocked, and it
was while passing the one occupied by
Mrs. Davis and her sister that the In
truder was seen. Mrs. Davis was aroused
by a noise in the hallway. A man's head
peering into the open door then fully
aroused her to action. She first screamed,
and catching hold of her sister awakened
Tfce two women Jumped out of bed and
as they did so they heard the burglars
footsteps beating a hasty retreat.
Davis called lustily the nam^s of the

get your revolver." None oÂ£ the "help,
who occupy apartments on the third floor
In the rear of the house, was awakened
until after the burglar had .gone. After
the women had frightened 'the intruder
out of the house they stood on the front
veranda and for five minutes called for
assistance. A young man passing heard
their cries and notified the police. A
general alarm was sent in to l be Fiftieth

with Captain Madden drew up in front
of the residence. â¢
\Mra. Davis was unable to give a de

Address to the Voters.
In view of the importance of the ap
proaching election the Republican Pri
mary League last night issued the follow
ing address to the voters of San Fran
clsco:
The Republican Primary League desires'
to call the attention of the voters to the
fact that the registration for the primary
election will close on August 3, 1901.
The people of San Francisco should realize
that this election will determine the char
acter of the men who will control the
municipal government for the next two
years. While the citizen may be Indiffer
ent at the time of the primary election, he
is not Indifferent when he goes to pay his
tax bill. Good citizens are prone to com
plain of the complexion of political affairs
and vet, when they have the remedy In
their own hands they fall to use it. Under
the new primary law, primary elections are
now under the control of the Election Com
missioners, and every vote cast . at the
primary election will be honestly counted.
The delegates who are to be elected will
meet in* convention and nominate men who
will conduct municipal affairs during the
next two years. It Is fair to presume that
if good men are elected as delegates good
men will -be nominated by the convention.
How can good delegates be named, how can
an honest, fair and intelligent . convention
be secured without ' the assistance of in
telligent and free citizens and their \ co
operation by casting their ballots at i the
primary election In favor of Â¦ good Â¦ men ? ~
. The .disgraceful political conditions of the
past were largely the result of indifference
on. the -part of the best elements in both
political parties to their real political duties
as citizens of our municipality. ' It is with
the hope ' of overcoming this indifference
and accomplishing a final and lasting vic
tory that the Republican Primary League
urges every citizen of both parties, and re
gardless of whatsoever party faction he may
be connected with: "First,, if necessary,

choice for delegates, on August 13.

Senator Perkins says Lynch's . appoint
ment was forced on him. Is it possible
now that he is being forced to' retain
Lynch? , Is the Senator being forced by
Van Fleet; Herrin and Gage?- In view, of
tlie embarrassing predicament of our senior
Senator it is high time. that Senator Bard
should come to the relief of his colleague.
The Senator's present position in con
nection with Lynch's incumbency is pecu
liar and awkward. He is now interposing
obstacles to Â¦tBe removal of a man who was
forced on him four- years ago. It cannot
be said that prominent Republicans ure
clamoring for the Revenue Collector's re
tention. On the contrary leading Republi
cans throughout the district are signify
ing an earnest desire for a change in that
office. Senator Bard perceives that the
change should be made now, early in the
fiscal year. Another good reason for the
change is the fact that Lynch has. had
the job four years. A further good rea
son for the change is the fact that he is
meddling in local political affairs and
promising public patronage to induce men
to get out and fight the Republican Prim
ary League.-
In an Awkward Position.
The Senator replied:
"I neither affirm nor deny the statement.
If I did advise any one to protest the ad
vice was given in conversation. It Is
likely that I said to man who objected to
the recommendation, 'File a . protest
against the appointment.' I had no per
sonal reasons for â¢ favoring- Lynch. He
never asked me to recommend him. He
was elected to support me for Senator,
but went over to my principal opponent,
Mr. de Young. All these appointments
made four years ago Â¦were made with the
approval of the delegation. It is wrong to
create the impression that I am responsi
ble for Lynch. I am not pledged to retain
him in office. I am free to act according
to my judgment. It is my recollection
that Lyuch was indorsed by the Congres
sional committees of X>oud's district, Hll
born's dlstrlot, the Fourth district, then
represented, by Magulre, and of the Log
Angeles district." â¢
yf^s. UR senior United States Senator,
/I \V George C. Perkins, desires the
II IB people to believe, that he is not
responsible for John C. Lynch's
appointment to the position of
Collector of United States Internal Reve
nue, First California District. Speaking
of the appointment yesterday Senator Per
kins said:
"Lynch was forced on me by members
of the Legislature, prominent politicians,
members of the Republican State Central
Committee and representatives of four
Congressional committees. There were
fifty men, any one of whom I would rath
er have recommended than Lynch. Frank
McLaughlin, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, came to Wash
ington with Lynch's indorsements. M. H.
de Young was one of the strongest In-,
dorsers of Lynch. It is my recollection
that the Congressional delegation joined
In asking the President to' appoint
Lynch." â¢ â¢ .
' The Senator was asked yesterday if he
had any information to impart in response
to the following inquiry published in last
Sunday's Call:
"Did you not after recommending the
appointment of John C. Lynch ask a well
known and eminent Republican of Call-,
fornia, who was then close to the admin
istration at Washington, to file a protest
1 against said appointment?"
"I have been spoken to about the mat
ter by some of Mr. Lane's friends, and
with Nathan Cole, Jud 'Rush and others
have discussed the possibilities of his suc
cess before the Democratic convention,
and before the people in the event of his
securing the | nomination. I can safely
venture to say. and I will be borne out by
most of the leading Democrats of the
south, that the men who always control
the Democratic organization will be for
Lane." - Â¦ . s
gels Camp, Calaveras, County, is a candi
date for . the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination. Representatives of Mr. Lane
were in the city last week feeling the
pulse of the Democratic leaders of the
south- relative to the possibility of Lane
securing their support In the event of his
entering the fight for the nomination.
Jud Rush, Nathan Cole, J. Harvey Mc-
Carthy, F. W. Allender and other party
leaders throughout this part of the State,
now that the secret of the mission of
Lane's friends- to the south is out, are
declaring that the millionaire is the only
available Democratic candidate .. In the
State to give Governor Gage battle, and
that he will go to the convention with a
practically solid delegation from the
south. F. W. Allender, one of the Lane
boomers here, paid to-day that there was
no question. about Lane's candidacy.

PACIFIC GROVE. July 29.â The Sun
day-closing ordinance which was passed
at the last meeting of the Pacific Grove
City Council went into effect yesterday
end caused consternation throughout the
town. The ordinance closes all places of
business within the city limits on Sunday
except drug stores, restaurants, barber
shops, livery stables and transfer and
newspaper agencies. Druggists are pro
hibited from selling anything except-drugs
for medicinal purposes only, and restau
rants are required to close their doors
except during meal hours designated in
the ordinance. Bakery and milk wagons
are prohibited from running during the
day.
The ordinance was rigidly enforced yes
terday, many persons having to go with
out breakfast because they arrived at
their restaurants too late, and others who
neglected to lay in their Sunday supply of
bread on Saturday went breadless all day.
Not a cigar or package of chewing gum
even was sold in the town during the day.
and discontented murmurings were heard
all over town In consequence. It is be
lieved by many that the new ordinance
will cause trouble very soon and many
who do not wish such strict Sunday clos
ing declare it is unconstitutional as well
as a detriment to the growth of the town.
It Is stated that the city fathers are pre
pared to back up its enforcement and
many persons on both sides of the con
troversy predict a bitter fight before the
matter* Is finally settled.

"Four of us, P. J. Rooney of Seattle,
C. Sullivan and F. Sullivan, brothers,
from Butte, Mont., and myself, landed
at Cape Lipin, Unimak Island, on May
12 to prospect the country. On June 7
we landed in a dory at another part of
the island. On returning to the boat at
2 p. m. we found that the Indians had
stolen our guns and ammunition and saw
them hiding behind rocks. They
opened fire without a word of warning
and shot Florence Sullivan dead. They
fired again, hitting Rooney, who fell
mortallv wounded, whereupon an Indian
ran up "to him and shot him dead. An
other shot went through my clothes but
I distanced the natives without sustain

prospectors on Unimak Island, Alaska,

CLOVERDALE, July 29.â The large ho
tel and numerous cottages at the Geysers
narrowly escaped destruction by fire late
this afternoon. The excellent service ren
dered by the guests In fighting back the
blaze was all that prevented a repetition
of the disaster that befell the Byron
Springs establishment a few days ago.
While the large . number of guests were
at supper about 5 o'clock they were star
tled by a cry of fire from hotel attendants,
who discovered smoke and flame issuing
from the roof. Men, women and children
sprang from their seats at the table, and
while nearly all. were content to gain the
most available exit some of the more
venturesome sought to reach their rooms
with a frantic purpose of saving their
valuables.
The blaze, which had been started by a
defective electric light wire, burned rap
idly through the dry roofing and had
reached alarming proportions when L.
Schoenfeldt and William J. Gallagher of
San Francisco hurriedly organized a hose
and bucket brigade. Every hotel guest
able to bear the burden of a water bucket
was hustled into line, ladders were raised
and after a half-hour of wearying labor
the progress of the fire was arrested. A
number of men clambered upon the bias

shingles and upper timbers. The damage

and the water shed of the mountains sent
down torrents which overflowed the valley
and rose above the highest grade of track.
The Southern Pacific engineers in Tucson
estimate that at least three days will be

first train can pass. Passengers from
Mexico are detained at Huachuca siding,
where they are being cared for by the

Alcazar.
Charlotte Thompson's "The Adventures
of Nell Gwynne" was reproduced last
night at the Alcazar with Florence Rob
erts as Saucy Nell, the King's sweetheart,
before a large and well pleased audience,
which showed its appreciation of the com
edy by curtain calls at the end of each of
the five acts of the play. The role dis
plays Miss Roberts' lighter vein of acting'
at its best, and the character loses noth
ing of its dare-devil features in her por
trayal. Miss Roberts was the character
to the life and earned all the liberal ap
plause that she received.
Her support was exceptionally good.
White Whlttlesey as Charles II was at his
best and proved to be a right royal jeal
ous lover. George P. Webster , was well
cast, the role of Actor Haynes fitting nls
hyperbolic style nicely. The support in
general was excellent.
Grand Opera-House.
The revival of "The Senator" by the
Frawley Company last evening was wit
nessed by a. large audience. In the role
of Senator Hannibal Rivers.
Roberts does not display the bright,
breezy manner that made the assumption
by Macklyn Arbuckle even superior to
that of William Crane. There are many
good points, however, to Roberts' per
formance. E. J. Morgan walked through
the character of Count von Strohl and
his ability Is wasted on the role. The
quiet, artistic acting of Katherlne Grey
as Mabel Denman was most convincing,
and' Pearl Landers was buoyant as Josle
Armstrong, the "girl who coins words."
Mary Van Buren, as the susceptible,
widow, Mrs. Hillary, lacked finesse and
delicacy. The support was fair.
Columbia.
Chauncey Olcott commenced the second
and last week of his appearance at the
Columbia Theater last night in his new
play "Garrett O'Magh." The house was
well filled and the audience was very ap

UTgan i&ecitai. : . '
Fully 2500 admirers of ' Prof essor H.' J.
Stewart gathered at the Pavilion last
night, the occasion being his farewell or
gan recital prior to his departure; for, the
East.' .The grand Stanford memorial or
gan; under his magic touch, became as. a
thing imbued with a living soul, and for
two â¢ hours the audience sat as under a
spell, while at his touch the music of the
masters thrilled with marvelous effect
through -the vast inclosure. â¢ The pro
gramme, from Boellmann's -."Suite Â¦ Goth-
Ique" to Wagner's; grand, fantasia,- "Das
Rhelngold." was replete with numbers,
the rendition of which Drovoked continued
AND now begins the serious busi
ness of life. Grand opera is upon
us! The summer Is done, the sea
son begun and as serious farewell
as we' ever take of the rosy god
dess-must now be said. "The Babes in
the .Wood" have gone the way of all light
and lonely nonsense, and "Aida," grave
and gracious, now craves a hearing. TEe
only Ferris has. disappeared in the wilds
of Portland, and where he opened, that
abundant mouth of his Salassa now
stalks supreme. Collamarihi rules where
Annie Myers once delighted, and only
change is eternal. Â¦
But there's a deal to be grateful for In
this change. Last night was by much the
best opening night I have ever seen dur
ing my Tivoli experience of grand opera.
Things went with astonishing smooth
ness. The chorus and the orchestral work
were of unusual excellence, and the cast
was beyond comparison tne most satisfac
tory that has been heard in the opera at
the popular house. As to the audience, it
was the usual comfortable, extravagantly
enthusiastic overflowing crowd that in
variably greets the opening opera of the
Tlvoll season, and it outdid its customary
exploits In both appreciation and ap
plause. Each singer got a huge welcome
on his or her appearanceâ first Signor
Dado and Castellano, then Barbareschl
and CoUamarini, then Salassa, then Nico
lini and even little Plo Facci, not to speak
of Mr. Paul Steindorff, the leader. Flow
ers galore there were, too, mostly for the
charming Barbareschl, who won the house
by her artless pleasure In receiving them.
Salassa, too, received many more flowers
than he owned up to, and Collamarlui,
Paul Steindorff and every one was thus
greeted. Altogether, the season has
opened to the tune of success.
Signor Dado Is the single newcomer In
the cast. He made an excellent impres
sion on his first (and only) appearance
here with Madame Sembrlch, and last
night fully Justified the warmth of his
reception. He reminds, in personal ap
pearance, of Edouard de Reszke, and has
a smooth, resonant and deep voice,
used in an absolutely legitimate
fashion. His Ramphis met all re
quirements of the part. Salassaâ what a
welcome he got!â is in excellent voice.
One trembled, remembering his last year s
indisposition, but his opening notes dis
posed of any fear on that score. His
Amonasro is a splendid piece of work
from every standpoint. He looks, sings
and acts the part exactly as it should be
Coilamarini's Amneris Is new to usâ
there is much of Collamarinl herself that
is new to us this yearâ perhaps forty
pounds, for the shapely Carmen is rapidly
acquiring the time-honored build of the
regulation prima donna. One discerns the
Carmen in Amneris, hears the Carmen ac
cent in her voice, but the singer has the
same charm in the part that made her
Carmen so famous. Her voice is lovely
warm, rich, human, thrilling; used at
times marvelously, but again forced as no
human voice should be forced, just as it
was forced in her Carmen. The part is
splendidly acted, with all the power and
passion that makes the singer's work so
distinctive, and the singer was received
with utmost enthusiasm.
Barbareschi was very nervous at the be
ginning of the evening, but later recovered
herself and gave us a charming Aida.
She looks the part, has an excellent make
upâno common thing with Aidasâ and
give3 a true and graceful conception of
the character. Her voice is both sweet
and sympathetic, and were her technique
surer, Barbareschi would be a very ad
mirable singer. She was greeted warmly
by the audience.
Castellano's Radames is an adequate
rendering. He is sure of himselfâ always
there, and his voice smooth and brilliant â
though lacking wholly in resonance, is
very serviceable. Nlcollnl did the King's
part acceptably and Pio Facie the mes
senger.
Paul Steindorff must be congratulated
on the smoothness and finish of the per
formance. He has proven himself a capa
ble and artistic conductor, one of the
best we have had here. The orchestra
was kept In Its place, the rhythms were
elastic, the balance of tone good and the
chorus work was exceptionally worthy.
The scenes and staging were also of the
best.
Russo, Repetto, Ferrari, PoletinI and
Nicolini will appear to-night in "Rlgolet
to," the alternating bill for the week.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
California.
Henry Arthur Jones' splendid disserta
tion on marriage the equity of the
sexes done up In most palatable form In
his charming play, "The Case of Rebel
lious Susan," brought the Neill Company
back to the California Theater last night.
It was a splendid performance worthy of
the play and the snug little company.
"Rebellious Susan" is a literary play and
a false move, a wrong tone would spoil
it beyond reparation. However, each
player fitted neatly and well Into his or
her respective part and there was nothing
to mar a performance which Individually
and collectively was excellent.
Edythe Chapman was a thoroughly
lovable, -womanly Susan. She dressed the
part well and played It with a delightful
grace and dainty touch. Julia Dean
astonished even her admirers by her
splendid performance of Mrs. Quesnel. Her
lines so neatly given carried well, but her
delicate, girlish appearance was against
her. It takes considerable Imagination to
picture dainty Julia Dean as a worldly
wise widow. Miss Louise Brownell as
Elaine Shrlmpton was forcible and con
vincing. She was the woman's rights
woman to the life.
"Rebellious Susan" Is a play that gives
the men equal chances with the women.
Sir Richard Kato Is essentially a role that
actors call "fat," and Neill took the
middle of the stage with it and held it in
spite of all comers. John TV. Burton was
a salty Admiral Sir Joseph Darby. George
Bloomquest certainly "left his stamp
upon" the audience as Fergusson Poybus,
and Donald Bowles was dreadfully in
earnest as Lucien Edensor.
The play was splendidly mounted and
should do a splendid week's business.
Central.
The oft-seen naval drama, "The En
sign," proved a strong: drawing card at
the Central last night. The frequent &t
testatlons of approval on the part of the
audience, which the flne staging of the
play, together with the conscientious
work of a well-cast company, evoked,
proved beyond question that its popular
ity has not waned. The play Is an excit
ing one, and it teaches a wholesome, les-
Bon in patriotism and love of flag and
country. These are qualities which the
average American cannot Ignore, and it
partly accounted for the. frequent out
bursts of applause that greeted the vari
ous scenes as presented last night.
James M. Brophy was at his best as
Ensign Ben Baird. his â¢ scene before the
naval .court of inquiry being especially
strong. As the bluff old coxswain, Jack
Dudley, James Corrlgan shared with the
star the honors of the evening. Howard
Scott, an Alcazar favorite, who made : his
debut at this house, gave a dignified por
trayal of the part of Captain "Wllkes.
George Nicholls was an admirable Abra
ham Lincoln. 1 Juliet Crosby, as Alice
Greer. was excellent. Georgie Cooper dis
played her versatile talent to advantage
as Dot. The support generally -was ex
cellent. - Â¦.}-. :Â»Â¦.-.-,-Â¦>. - â¢ :.-.â'.
The audience at Â¦ the Orpheum exper'
enced a disappointment last evening. Miss
Alexandra Dagmar, the noted vocalist,
was unable to appear, owing to illness,
but it was announced that .the - artist
would be able to appear this evening
without fall.. The bill is among: the best
that have been put on the Orpheum for
many a week. San. Franciscans have
seen La Loie Fuller and Paplnta many
times, but Ameta, now dancing at the Or
pheum, is new to the city and is a pleas
ant surprise. Hugh Stanton and Florence
Modena appear in "A Bargain Fiend,"
and alone furnish sufficient fun for an
evening's entertainment. And better still
is "The Bifurcated- Girl," presented by
Will H. Murphy and Blanche Nicholls.

RAIN PREVAILS
IN CORN BELT
Weather Bureau Predicts
Showers East of the Mis
souri River.
Reduced.
Temperature in Parched
District Materially
WASHINGTON, July 29.â Official advices
to the Weather Bureau are confirmative
of the press reports of the prevalence of
rains over the corn belt last night, with
cooler weather than yesterday. During
the past twenty-four hours rain has fallen
very generally in that section with some
few exceptions, notably Southern Ohio,
Kentucky and Southwestern Nebraska.
While not very heavy In amount, the
rains are described officially as pretty fair
for summer time. At Kansas City there
was' over an inch of precipitation, from a
quarter to almost two inches in various
parts of Iowa, in Nebraska the rainfall
was fair, in Kastern and Northern Okla
homa there were some showers, but In
Missouri they were, pretty fair. Showers
are predicted to-morrow east of the Mis
souri River and fair weather west. Tem
peratures were generally above 90 degrees,
but in .some localities they did not get so
high. For the next day or two tempera
tures will be reasonably moderate as com
pared with those of the past heated pe
riods Â¦ - f Â¦
In many sections of the Middle Atlantic
States there have been high temperatures
to-day, but in Northern New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and New York they were
reduced to-day as a result of showers. In
Washington the weather has been exceed
ingly oppressive to-day, the thermometer
registering a maximum of 97 degrees, with
an unusual degree of humidity in the at
mosphere.
STOCKTON, July- 29.â Attorney A. &.
Carpenter, who was indicted by the
Grand Jury on charges of perjury and
subornation of perjury, to-day swore to
an affidavit before the County Clerk de
manding a change of venue. The affidavit
states that Judges Budd and Jones are
prejudiced against the affiant and that
he cannot secure a fair trial in thi3 coun
ty. He asks that the case be transferred
to Sacramento County or that Judge "W.
G. Lorlgan of Santa Clara County be
called to preside at the trial.
Says Judges Are Prejudiced.
She Is Not. Doing Herself
Justice and "Will Not
Go to Newport.
COLUMBIA WINS
THE ASTOR CUP
Behavior of Constitution
Proves Exceedingly
Disappointing.
The Boston boat Independence started
over the course about a mile ahead of the
racers. She tackled them to leeward off
the Block Island mark and did windward
work similar to that of the racers, but
at no time did she show any great speed.
Start. Finish. El'ps'd. Cor'ctd.
Constitution Â».ll:07:38 2:56:51 3:49:13 3:49:13
Columbia 11:08:19 2:54:33 3:46:19 3:44:45
Â¦ The Columbia covered this long leg
three minutes and nineteen seconds faster
than the new boat. This settled the race,
for the Constitution was unable to even
cut down this lead on the. short run home
and so they finished. The" summary:
As the two 90-footers rounded the Block
Island mark the Constitution had the
weather berth. She did not keep it long.
Instead of a beat to windward, the beat
to the second mark resolved itself. into
a very long leg on the port tack, with a
couple of short hitches on the starboard
stretch.
It is not easy for the best friend of the
Constitution to make plausible excuses
for her most palpable defeat. She was
beaten fairly and squarely on her merit J
Running almost dead before the wind on
the first leg of the course she at first
opened quite a gap of clear water between
herself and the Columbia, and it looked as
though she would have a long lead in the
run down the wind. So long as the wind
continued light she had it all her own
way, but when it freshened the Columbia
slowly but surely overhauled her and
when they got to the first mark was only
a few lengths astern..
The behavior of the Constitution on the
other^ hand was disappointing: in the ex
treme and this evening- Mr. Duncan an
nounced that his boat would not take- part
in f urther\ races until her rig had been
altered. He declared that the Constitu
tion is not doing herself Justice; that she
is not going well and that there is no uss
in racing her further until she Is put in
proper shape. Â¦ .
The Constitution will not participate In
the Newport- yacht racing events of
Thursday and Saturday of this week as
a competitor^ of ithe Independence. The
Columbia, however, has been entered for
these races and will sail against the Bos
ton boat.- The Constitution will go to
Bristol at once to have the alterations
made. If this change in the plans of the
Constitution does' not prevent, the next
races in which she will start will take
place over the Newport course on August
12 and 14 and the regatta, wiir be under
the auspices of the, New York .Yacht Club."
In; one of. these races the cup. offered by
Sir Thomas Lipton will be sailed for. The
regular- trial races for the purpose of se
lecting the defender of the America's cup
will be held August 31 and September 1
and 3. The wind to-day never exceeded
thirteen knots, and although there was
a long roll of. the sea setting In from the
southwest, ' the water â¢ was by.no means
rough. In fact. Newport catboats took it
quite kindly with a single reef in their
main sails. The course was a total dis
tance of thirty-eight nautical miles. The
wind was north by east at the start and
north-northeast at the finish. It started
with a force of about nine knots when
the preparatory gun was fired and fresh
ening gradually as the race progressed,
it attained a strength of thirteen or four
teen knots, when the Columbia was greet
ed as the winner. " -
NEWPORT, R. I., July 29.â The Colum
bia to-day defeated the Constitution boat
for boat in a splendid race by two min
utes and fifty-four seconds and won the
$1000 cup presented by Jonn Jacob Astor.
Her victory was decisive and convincing.

question cornea news from China that
large bands of Boxers are again becom
ing troublesome. A special received lost
night from Shanghai says:. The North
China Daily Nowb announces that there
has been a recrudescence of the out
breaks by the Boxers in the province of
Shantung, in consequence of the success
of the allied villagers in Chili province

CALL- BUREAU, 140G G STREET.
N. W., WASHINGTON, July 29.â Special
Commissioner Rockhill cabled Acting Sec
retary HJ11 to-day that the foreign Min
isters in Peking have : completed the dis
cussion of the indemnity question. Inter
est on the indemnity will be payable seml
annually, Rockhill reports. Interest is to
begin with the 1st of July of this year,
and the first payment is to be made Jan
uary 1 next. In order to give Qhina an
opportunity to secure' a balance in her
treasury she will be given three years for
the payment. of the first .installment on
the principal.. Â¦ . .
-Payments will be made to a financial
committee stationed in Shanghai. The
committee will be a mixed body, cafled
the committee of encashment, and will be
composed of the heads of the foreign
banks at Shanghai designated by the in
terested governments to receive and dis
tribute the money they shall have collect
ed from China. The committee Â¦will have
no other function than receiving and dis
tributing the funds. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ . . â¢
Avoiding' Embarrassment.
Mr. Rockhill ' adds that the diplomatic
corps in Peking favors the immediate ap
plication of the new tariff, which consists
of a 5 per cent , effective duty and prac
tically abolishes the free list except cer
eals. . â¢; . : Â¦
Acting Secretary. Hill has instructed
Rockhill to urge the exemption of cargoes
afloat and sufficient postponement of the
application of .the new tariff , to enable Im
porters to complete existing contracts,
thus avoiding the embarrassment com
merce would suffer from the imposition of
duty upon articles which have hitherto
been on the free list. . :

Experiments In France have proved convinc
ing, and the French believe they are certain
to play a role of much importance in modern
warfare. It is odd to note the different uses
to which nature and science are put.- On the
battlefield they fight for the destruction of lire,
while throughout the country, Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters fights to preserve it. For fifty
years the Bitters has been curing dyspepsia, in
digestion, constipation and biliousness. It will
also prevent malaria, fever and ague.
A Financial Success.
At no time In the history of the State has
there been such a determined effort on the part
cf enterprising firms and corporations to bring
to the notice of the consumer the various exÂ»
cellent food products of California as Js now
being made, and the results already obtained
are most gratifying.
The moft marked success is that of the Fig
prune Cereal Company of San Jose. This com
pany be^aa operations Jn a Fmall way last
August and the demand for its product, - Fig
prune Cereal, a delicious cereal coffee, has in
creased with such rapidity that the erection of
a fai-tory large enough to meet the requirements
of the Eastern trade Is necessary.
Plans for a modern plant with a- capacity,
when fully equipped, of one million cases per
year have been prepared and ground for the
ceu- buiJdins w'JI be broken next month.

North American Commercial
1 Company's steamship Conemaugh
Â¦ arrived from Nome direct yester
1L ' day morning and during the after
noon the St. Paul of the same
company sailed for the gold fields. The
Conemaugh brought down no passengers
and but little freight. From St. Michael
and Nome came $651,000 in gold dust, all
consigned to the owners of the vessel.
There was only one steamship â the Dis
covery â at Nome when the Conemaugh
left and she had been ordered home by
the inspectors of hulls and boilers.
The Conemaugh is a freight boat, and
on her last trip north took up eighty head
of beef cattle, eighty horses, 1000 sheep
and 500 hogs. These were all landed at
Nome in twenty-four hours and the peo
ple got their first taste of fresh meat in
ri'Oiiths the next day. The officers of the
steamship say that Nome and Teller are
overrun with cheap labor, men being
willing to work for their prrub. At St.
Michael men could not be procured to han
dle the freieht and a '.steamer had to be
sent to Nome to bring down laborers.
The Conemaugh brought downline re
mains of the wife'of Colonel H. C. Leacb.
They were taken in charge by an under
taker and will be buried to-day.
The St. Paul took away a very large
general cargo and about thirty passen
gers. Among- those who went away on
the steamship were two brides, one bride
to-be and a lady who was so anxious to
get north that she left all her baggage
behind and sailed for Nome in the clothes
in which she stood. The St. Paul's cabin
passengers were: : :
Mrs. Lancaster and child. Mrs. Muldowney,
M'ss A. Hill. James Hill. Miss M. Hill, Mrs.
John Vhitley. H. L Dixon, S. Carter, Mrs.
S. Carter. Mrs. J. S. McCann. J. D. Will.
Mrs. J. II. Baker. J. S. McCann, Mrs. H.
Turner Miss E. Thomas, W. A. Maxwell, Mrs.
A. Zipf. A. Meyer, "\V. F. Gibson and wife,
F. R. Gibson, H. C. Pasquale, F. B. Mal
donado. Miss S. Elden, Mrs. M. L. Washbura,
Mrs. E. Lundberg and Cora Hepworth.
Mrs. S. Carter Is one of the brides. Her
husband is the agent of the Standard Oil
Company at Nome, and a few days ago
he arrived here to get" married. He is
now returning with his bride> Mrs. ' A.
Zipf is the other bride. She was formerly
Miss Sadie Walsh, the actress, and her
husband is in the employ of the North
American Commercial Company. He went
north on the last steamship, and Â¦ she is
now following him. Miss E. Thomas is
the bride-Jo-be. She is going north to
marry Oliver Marston, a Nome merchant.
Cora Hepworth is the lady who caught
the St. Paul at the last moment. Noth
inpr is known about her save that she
was In a desperate hurry to Â£et north.
She asked that her baggage, be sent after
her on the Conemaugh, and then taking
a hack dashed down to the front and
caught the last boat out to the steam
ship. Should the Conemaugh be tied up
by the strike Miss or Mrs. Hepworth will
have to buy a new outfit at Nome.
Other passengers by the St. Paul were
Mrs Turner, whose husband is employed
by the North American Commercial Com
pany at Nome, and Mrs. M. L. Washburn,
wife of the superintendent of "the same
concern. Mrs. E. Lundberg is going north
to join her husband.

W\, WASHINGTON. July 29.â Until, they
are called by the Dexrey court of inquiry
end make under oath statements of any
information they may possess, officers of
the navy must refrain from publicly dis
cussing the Bampson-Schley controversy.
Secretary Long issued to-day the gen
eral order he decided upon last week as a
result of the discussion then in progress.
This Is the order:
Xavy Department,
Â¦WASHINGTON'. D. C. July 29. 1901.
Geieral- order No. 12â All persons in the naval
service are strictly enjoined to refrain from
any public statement concerning the subject
matter of the court of inquiry requested by
Hear Admiral W. S. Schley.
JOHN B. LONG, Secretary.
TVhile there is a general naval regula
tion which forbids officers from publicly
talking- about matters pertaining to the
personnel of 'he naval service without
express authority from the department,
no attention wis apparently paid to that.
Testifying under oath, the exact truth
will be obtained, and the Secretary be
lieves that thj country would prefer to
wait until it can be thus obtained.
Xo intimation has been received by the
department from Rear Admiral Schley
that he desires any change in the precept
issued by the department relative to the
investigation to be made by the Dewey
court of inquiry. If Rear Admiral. Schley
objects to that provision directing an in
quiry into 'â¢circumstances attending and
reasons for disobedience," of which he is
alleged to be guilty, the Secretary -will
take under consideration the advisability
of making- a change. This specification of
the precept was particularly drawn, and
the department used as a basis for the
language employed Admiral Schley's own
words, "much to be regretted, cannot obey
orders of the .iepartment."
Secretary Long Issues the Or.
der Forbidding Any Pub
lic Statement
No Intimation Received From Roar
Admiral Schley That He Desires
a Change in the Wording

ANOTHER CHICAGO UTTERANCE.
CHICAGO University, under the' potent spell
of the Rockefeller millions, rose as rapidly to
~ eminence as Aladdin's enchanted palace, and
it has been making reputation through the mouths of
its professors about as rapidly as it rose. First came
the announcement of a theory of human valuations,
which one of the professors set forth by way of prov
ing Rockefeller to be greater than Shakespeare. In
quick succession followed manifestos from various
members of the faculty declaring the feasibility of liv
ing on 10 cents a day, the folly of marrying a co-edu
cated woman, the necessity of a continuous stream of
immigration from Europe to prevent the American
people from reverting to the Indian type;, and now
comes the further assertion from' the same learned
source that collegesgoing has become'a'fad among
young men and women in this country arid that a ma
jority of students have^no real ambition for learning
and ought not to be at the universities.-
The expense of trying Earl Russell for bigamy be
fore the House of Lords has been so large that there
is talk in Parliament of abolishing the right of a
nobleman to have such a trial, and so another old his
toric privilege of the British aristocracy is-^about to
perish because it does not suit an age where money
counts for more than birth.

One expression of the whist face, though
It is sad, and is told with an effort, is age.
The women may shudder at the thought,
but the fact remains. Intense thought and
daily racking the memory -to remember
what cards have been played' cannot but
deepen the lines and hasten what hereto
fore the women have left for time to ac
complish without their permissionrrM '
. We have all sorts of faces/all varieties
of. countenances, that get their recognized
expressions from close application to some
variety of straining employment. Now we
have , "the whist face" to add to the list.
It is showing itself among the women, and
comes from the whist club habit, which is
rapidly growing, showing its strength not
only at' night, but in the afternoons and
even in the mornings, associated with tea
and wafers, chocolates and bonbons. r
Nature can recover from this sort of
thing when occasionally indulged in, but
when it becomes a habit, practiced almost
daily, and sometimes for two or more ses
sions a day, the expression becomes fixed
and follows the wearer, no matter what
her thought or occupation may be at the
time. ;: vAv.vvl-.
In the whist face you will see the far
away look, accompanied by arched lines
on. the forehead, suddenly- changing to an
expression of inward contemplation, as
sociated with a tightening 1 of the lips.
These expressions come from an acrobatic
mind under training that consists in leap
ing from the first lead, Jump b>vjump,
over each successive play that must be
made, while keeping the mental eye on
the accepted rules, not neglecting to ob
serve and respond to signals.

MOLLY MAGUIRESâ B., City. The or

formed in Ireland more than fifty years
ago, "to protect Irish renters against
heartless and"cruel landlords." It is said
that the organization .took Its name front
a woman named Molly Maguire, who had
taken her cause into her own hands when
a process of eviction was served upon her,
and that she successfully resisted the bai
liffs who had been sent to evict her. The
young men who composed the society used
to dress in women's clothing when en
gaged in resisting a bailiff or other offi
cers employed by landlords.

COMPROMISING SOHLEY'S CASE.
I"Tâ¢1 VER. since the controversy arose between the
r""< partisans of Admiral Sampson and Admiral
Â¦*â ' Schley, the yellow journals have been doing
their best to make the most of it and to gain some
thing of popularity for themselves by posing as the
advocates of Schley. The call for a court of inquiry
to investigate and report upon the charges made
against Schley has given these journals a new oppor
tunity for displaying their activity and making fools of
themselves and they have been prompt . to take
advantage of it.
Already they have set to work urging their readers
to "write to the President" demanding "protection"
for Schley. A more foolish proceeding could not
well be devised. The President has no power over
the court and if he had it would not be proper for
him to interfere in its proceedings. The only stage at
which he can interfere in such matters is that of
pardoning persons who have been convicted. There
fore to write to the President now is tantamount to
an expression of a belief that Schley has been guilty
of some wrong and ought to be pardoned.
Such a misrepresentation of Schley's attitude does
him gross wrong. He himself requested the court of
inquiry. He goes before it to vindicate himself against
aspersions that have been put upon him by his
enemies, and the persons who^are persuaded to write
to the President will injure rather than help Schley,
for they will give his enemies an opportunity to assert
that he is afraid of the very investigation he asked for
and that his friends are trying to help him out by
petitioning the President. *V; .
Another freak in the way of support for Schley
was that of publishing an alleged interview with
Admiral Cervera of the Spanish navy, in which the
Spaniard h reported to have said that Schley is "a
-gallant officer and a high minded gentleman;" and to
have added many other laudatory things. It is
doubtful if any such interview were ever had with
Cervera, but, admitting it were so, what would such
testimony be worth? Does any sane man suppose
""that Cervera, in talking for publication about the
commandeÂ« of the fleet which destroyed his own,
would say anything derogatory to his courage or his
skill? Would Cervera assert he had been conquered
by a coward? ~ m Â¦
Do the yellow journals or do any of their readers
believe that Admiral Schley needs petitions to the
President or the testimony ofSpaniards at this junc
ture? Has he not in the record of his glorious victory
ample proof of his seamanship, his valor, his ability
as a tactician and his loyalty?
Of course there is no way of preventing the yellow
journals from making such use of the occasion as
they deem most advantageous to themselves, but it is
a shame that, a gallant hero who has been assailed
already in so mean a manner by slanderous foes
should, now that he has summoned them to court,
have his ca?e compromised by sensational fakers.
Schley does not need nor do his friends ask for any
such defense as the yellow journals have put forward
for him. His case was well put by his son, Captain
Schley, in the recent stafement:
"When the court of inquiry meets I would like to
have the privilege of asking Admiral Sampson just
one questionâ 'If the battle of Santiago had resulted
in defeat, to whom would the blame have been at
tached?* This. I think, tells the situation in a nut
shell. If Admiral Schley' had lost the battle he would
have been blamed. He won it, and he should have
the credit."
We believe there will be no disputing that proposi
tion. The ''hero of Santiago is the' officer under whose
command the battle was fought and won.' That he
has fiad powerful foes is now evident, but powerful
as they are and grievously as they have injured him
it is doubtful if they have done, him more harm than
the yellow journals will do by their method of posing

r 1 land on which John Alexander Dowie, or Elijah 111,
I as he now calls himself, proposes to establish the great
âÂ¦: I urban colony of his followers, to be known as Zion City,
* lies on Lake Michigan, near "Waukegan, Wis. The Chi-
. cago and Northwestern Railroad passes through the sitÂ©
and another road very near it. ,
The stretch of prairie land has been surveyed and laid off in-
blocks! lots and parks, with streets and avenues between. In
the middle is a large square on which it is designed to place the
Temple of Zion

?i, s streets. treets ln Zion have Biblical names. Sheridan road
runs through a part of the town site, but Dowie has changed
the name of this to "Elijah avenue." Among the other avenues
are Gabriel, Ezekiel, Elim, Elizabeth, Eden. Ebenezer, Deborah
Bethany and Bethlehem. There are Bethel, Bethesda, Shiloh
ancTSalpm houipvarrl* nnd niimprniK nthpr thnrm^hfaros >mvo
ii Â« boulevards, and numerous other thoroughfares have
appellations familiar in sacred, history. .
On the 15th inst. the great sale of lots, or rather leases, was
Inaugurated and expected to continue eight days. Two hundred
thousand people were expected to attend, but not 3000 put In an
appearance. Three hundred lots were sold, giving- in
to Dowle's hands some $150,000. The leases which are
given the dupes in exchange for their cash are for 1100 years,
but are hampered and surrounded by conditions which make it
a matter of option with Dowie to declare the leasehold vacated
if he sÂ«ffrflt. An added clause provides for a return of E0 per
cent of the value in case of the lease being declared vacant. In
price the lots ranged from $270 to $2700. Some buyers were
guided by the names of the streets rather than the location oC
f ots. Th * nearestfcapproach to a rush for particular sites oc
curred when the advance guard discovered Gabriel avenue. Tha
lots on that thoroughfare were soon taken. Many looked'with
longing eyes on the choice locations along Elijah boulevard, but
few selected lots there. The $2700 lots are located on this street.
Some buyers went to Ezra avenue, others to Ezekiel avenue,
whlle stiirothers were satisfied with Enoch. The lowly follow
ers secured the cheapest lots, which are on the numbered
streets. Biblical names came high.
-At the same time a study of the points of difference
between man and the. lower animals gives probability
to Professor Koch's theory. Some animals are lack
ing in~the organic .machinery, required for some of
the,- functions that arc necessary, to the life of man.
Some animals have no gall, and some are immune to
poisons that are fatal to man, while they succumb to
doses of substances that are harmless to man. The
smallest quantity of saltpeter destroys sheep as
effectually as strychnine destroys man. There must
be, then, important physiological differences between
man and his brother" animals, since there are actual
anatomical differences. Animals* have their materia
medica. A cow will seek ribbon grass when . her
appetite is off, as will "a sheep. All animals' of the
sheep kind eat tobacco when" they can get it, and chew
down. a plug of the strongest with an energy and
appetite which show the craving of a natural need of
it. A dog corrects his disordered digestion by eating
grassland all animals of the cat kind seek catnip. . To
the larger varieties of that family it seems to be more
than a medicine, and is a luxury. Any one who has
seen a big lion go into raptures ov.er a' package of
catnip thrown into his, cage. can easily/realize that it
is to him what pipe and glass are to man. A buzzard
is immune to arsenic and fattens on it. Many other
facts may be quoted to show where man and brute
part company, physiologically, anatomically and path
ologically, and every such fact lends some support to
the theory of Professor Koch. . What is, wanted now
is a man to try it on.'
Unfortunately he is limited for experiment to just
one-half the field to be covered by the inquiry. He
has found it impossible to infect cattle with human
tuberculosis, but has . not found any one willing to
serve as the subject to the complementary experiment
of transmission, of the bovine tuberculosis to man.
He is confident, however, of the curability of con
sumption, and if this be demonstrated it should not
be difficult to find some one willing to take the risk
of. enlightening the world as to its origin, by sub
mitting to inoculation with the bovine variety. One
such experiment would not settle the matter, since
nearly, all men are now equally exposed to inocula
tion with consumption through the germs that are
spread broadcast by its victims, but only a percentage
of those exposed acquire the disease. So, many cross
inoculations will be required to prove that bovine
tuberculosis is innocuous to man.
There seem to be but few features in common
between an epidemic and an epizootic. Man' seems to
be differentiated from his brethren of the lower orders
in the animal kingdom. Animals do not have the
eruptive fevers, such as smallpox, measles and scarlet
fever, though these become epidemic among men.
Nor do animals have the enteric fevers, which are
also epidemic under certain conditions. They.- are
free also from the diseases of the alimentary tract
which afflict man. While "colt distemper" in horses
may be said to be the analogue of what are called the
juvenile diseases in man, it is not truly so, since it is
not common to all young horses; does not appear to
leave immunity behind it, nor to be apt to occur in
later life, if escaped in infancy. The epizootics seem
to be distinct in character from epidemics. The
presence of what has been called bovine tuberculosis
is not accompanied by any of the phenomena which
are present in consumption in man. There is no
suspension of nutrition, no / atrophy. The organic'
functions are not impaired. Thejrow is sleek, fat and
alert. So far as symptoms go there is . ground for
going further than Koch, and declaring that the germ
observed in cattle and called the tubercle is a .benign
parasite, innocuous and beneficial. Of course in a
matter of such vast import to mankind, it is wrong to
take any risks, and there should be no relaxation of
milk inspection until wide experiment has made
Professor Koch's reassuring theory a scientific cer
tainty.
There is a backing of probability to Professor
Koch's opinion, aside from the scientific basis which
a man of his eminence may be expected" to have for a
conclusion of such vast import to the world.
Now comes Professor Koch, the most distinguished
bacteriologist in theÂ»world, and declares to. the Con
sumption Congress' of physicians in London that
bovine tuberculosis is incommunicable to man, and
the precautions taken against it may be called off.
SINCE the discovery of a germ in cattle like the
tubercle in man it. has been taken for granted
that the two. were identical, and that tubercu
losis is communicable from cattle to man. So fixed
has this" opinion become that physicians and veterih
aries regard it as an orthodox conclusion of science,
and general efforts have been made to extirpate
bovine tuberculosis by extermination of affected herds.
PROFESSOR KOCH'S THEORY.
It is a bad wind that blows nobody" good, and
accordingly it is not surprising to learn that .the
suburban hotels around the big cities of the East have
coined money out of the hot spell. It is said that
<rt Coney Island hotels the dining rooms, parlors, and
even the bathrooms have been filled with cots for
sleepers who would not go back to the city.
At last we have reached the line of departure beyond
which there can be no division. The call to duty, is
to the real strenuous life. All should answer it. each
in his way, and there is a way for all. If we fail and
say so manfully we lose no prestige. If we fail and
deny it unmanfully we lose all.
Patience, probity, ,moral and physical courage,
abstention from the sordid use of power, respect for
native simplicity and weakness, must all have place in
our administration. . Denying to them their aspiration
for independence and self-government, we are about
to give them what we believe is a better government
than they can give themselves. Will they show kinship
of spirit with us by being "ungovernable by any
power but themselves?" If they do, what will we do?
Will we treat it as treason and deserving punishment,
or will we have the self-control and sense of justice to
salute it as vindication of their manhood? Ethics in
government is invaded by considerations of national
prestige. Perhaps a majority of men believe with the
German Emperor that the noblest instrument is the
sword. But surely a strong minority believe that the
noblest principle is justice. . ,
Now all this is changed. The notes of the war
bugle are growing fainter. The rush of the charge at
quickstep, the thrill of revenge, the thirst for glory,
have but feeble influence, for they are passing, and as
they pass the promptings of the conscience become
vocal and call this nation to harder duties than war
and to possible victories more glorious than are won
in battle.
It may be said with much justice that all men in
some degree share that quality with us. That spirit
in a people may be destroyed by killing the people
whom it inspires, or by wearing out their physical
power of resistance. \ But it is the spirit that has
enfranchised man wherever he has risen from bond
age. It is with the forlorn Boer when night falls upon
the veldt, and he sleeps on his rifle-stock for a pillow.
It nerved Rizal and Aguinaldo in their defiance of
Spanish power in 1896, and, to do them justice, was
the motive of the Filipinos in the hopeless resistance
to our arms, which made us indifferent to their fate,
while it lasted.
The character of the American people will therein
be tested, and over the most righteous performance
of duty will lie the shadow of man's unrest under the
government of any one but himself. Thomas F.
Bayard, while Embassador to Great Britain, in an
address to Edinburgh University for which he was
foolishly criticized, described the American people as
so stubborn and determined, that "they are ungov
ernable by any power but themselves." That is the
finest description and ascription of our national
character that has ever been uttered.
A similar time is already upon us. The Filipino
story of the war against the natives will never be told,
unless some Kinglake shall appear among us to tell
it. And if he do, it will not touch us as we will be
touched by the incidents that are to come in the
government of the islands.
But we are entering now upon the real strenuous
period, which will test us as war cannot test a nation.
The civil and social reorganization of about twelve
millions of people in the Philippines, provision for
their rights and prosperity without abridging our own,
will call for the exercise of genius and manifestation
of character to a degree far beyond any demand of
war. In fact, war is easy compared to the demands
of peace. England was less troubled by India when
Hastings was setting, the natives by the ears, bribing
or hanging them at will, as suited his purpose, and
Give was rising from unsuccessful attempts at suicide
to be the victor at Plassy and the conqueror of an
empire, than when the people of that empire lay help
less upon her conscience, and she was compelled to
listen to the demands of humanity upon her steward
ship. Her reputation suffered t less by the sharp
practices of the "John Company" and the rough riding
of her captains than by the faults and follies of her
civil administration.
The strenuous school hailed with gratification,
which the whole people came to share, the oppor
tunity of the Spanish War, and its results have made
upon the world an impression beneficial to the United
States. It has been put in sharp contrast with the
unfortunate experience of Great Britain in South
Africa, and its brevity and mighty consequences to
an ancient kingdom and once ''powerful empire have
assured to it a high place in history.
THE STRENUOUS PERIOD.
VICE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT- made the
country familiar with his idea of the "strenu
ous* life." Â¦'. It has been held, even by some who
claim the title of philosopher, that nations must have
periods of contention, stress and warfare, lest their
people become stale. It has been argued, too, that
such periods are so fixed by natural law that they
occur, without conscious guidance or procurement,"
seeming to b* a fixed factor in national and natural
life. This country would seem to have; had wars with
sufficient frequency to keep our people in the proper
condition. From 1776 to 1858, .one hundred and
twenty-two years, we had the War of the Revolu
tion, of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War and
that with Spain, averaging a conspicuous war every
twenty- four years, so that each generation since the
Declaration has had a smell of powder, to say nothing
of the minor wars with our own Indians, which filled
in the gaps, and, in the case of the long struggle with
the Seminoles, the tribes led by. Tecumseh and the
Sioux, were of sufficient importance to deserve "a place
in the record of military achievement.
In a recent address before the Illinois Bar Associa
tion Judge Tuley of Chicago complained that the
people of the country districts are opposed to the city

Seventy-two of the teamsters who were
Imported to this city by the Draymen's
Association to take the places of the
strikers embarked for their homes in
Bakersfleld yesterday, morning. Before
departure most of them had been won
ovf-r to' the side of the brotherhood and
had been made honorary members. Al
though they had come in passenger cars
at the expense of the Draymen's Associa
tion, they were shipped back in a freight
car attached to a Santa Fe freight train.
The accommodations, although not quite
so commodious, were. very, satisfactory,
as the men were all anxious to get back
to the country away from the strife and
turmoil of city strikes. -;>;.-
Walter McCarty, a union teamster, was
arrested yesterday morning by Police Of
ficer M. J. Filbcn for cutting a rope
which bound a load of goods on a wagon.
Tho mischief was done while the wagon
was being driven up Fourth street with
an officer in charge. McCarty was re
leased on S3 bail.
During the afternoon several minor "dis
turbances occurred in front of the team
sters' headquarters. But almost without
exception thej^ were caused by drunken
men not affiliated with the brotherhood.
Because his wagon became firmly
lodged In the Â«-ar track on Third street
a>id because the crowd which quickly
collected around the stranded vehicle
ridiculed his awkward attempts to extri
cate it a non-union driver, employed by
McNab & Smith deserted and went over
to the brotherhood. Another non-union
driver employed Ly the same firm while
loading his wagon at Bluxome-street
warehouse was struck by a striker. The
assailant made his escape before an of
ficer could be summoned. ..
A crowd of 200 strikers and their sym
pathizers caused a considerable disturb
ance during the morning: hours . at the
corner of First and Brannan streets.
Three of McNab & Smlth'i heavy trucks,
which were being driven by non-union
teamsters, chanced along:. The drivers
were hooted at and for a while it seemed
that a clash could not bo averted. The
mounted police that accompanied tho
trucks charged and drove the strikers
into the adjoining street*. During the
charge, however, a large glass window
In the front of Osncr & Co.'s saloon was
shattered.
At the Lowell warehouse In the morn
ing a team belonging to Stetson & Ren
ner and driven by a non-union teamster
became stalled. A crowd of Â¦ strikers
quickly gathered and jeered at the driver
in his ineffectual efforts to control the
horses, which were excited by the noise.
The crowd finally became so threatening,
that the police were forctxl to drive them
back with their clubs. In the melee
which followed sevcra.1 heads were
cracked.
The striking teamsters were strictly on
their good behavior yesterday and in con
sequence the police reported one of the
most quiet days since the inception of
the struggle. A considerable crowd con
gregated in front of the teamsters' head'
quarters on Fourth street, but they spent
their time in discussing the action which
probably would be taken by the City
Front Federation. It was generally ad
mitted that the federation's decision
would mark the turning point, not only
in tho teamsters' strike but of the box
makers and brewery lockouts and An all
other troubles that are at present agita
ting labor circles.
ances, but Nothing of Magnitude.
Some of the directors suggested that all
shipping be tied up and no attempt made
to send vessels out at all until the trouble
was adjusted, the object being to starve
the strikers out and compel them to con
sent to return to their work. Such policy,
however, would be most inimical to the
interests of thÂ© steamship managers and
it Is not probable that it will be adopted.

40 cents per hour and 50 cents per hour
for overtime. Owners of vessels point
out that this is in excess of what long

port of the United States. â¢
The probable action of the ; Steamship
Managers'. Association this' afternoon will
be to issue an ultimatum to the striking
employes, giving them' a specified time
possibly forty-eight hoursâ in which to re
turn to work. If that is disregarded the
result will be a contest, with a discontin
uance of the present accepted schedule of
wages in case the employers win their
fight. Â¦ Â¦
As to the request made by me to
them on behalf of tlie Brotherhood of
Teamsters, through Messrs. Furuseth
and Casey, they answer by saying
that they do grant the right of labor
to organise and that in the employ
ment of labor they will not discrimi
nate against men because they are
members of unions;, that they will
not be bound, however, to employ
none but union men; that their con
test as an organized body of employ
ers is against what they believe to be
unjust demands or the abuse of union
ism; that they require their employes
to faithfully obey all instructions and
orders of their employers, save where
such Instructions are contrary to law
or good morals or public policy; that
recently their employes refused to de
liver goods; that they asked them
why they refused and they said be
cause their union so directed them;
that they then asked their employes
if they would obey their employers or
the union, and when they said that
they would obey the union, then they
were dismissed. The employers take
the position that the employes must
take their orders from them; that tho
teamsters can go to work to-morrow,
that is to Bay, there will be no dis
crimination, provided they agree to
take orders from their employers with
the above qualifications; and that they
will not hereafter, directly or indirect
ly, engage in or support any attempt
to compel any other employe against
his free will and volition to become a.
member of any labor union, nor to
compel any employer to employ none
but union labor. /
The employers will not discriminate
against union men, and they would
naturally employ men who are pro
llcient. They say they know that the
members of tho union are capablo
draymen and they are peeking such
employes to do their work; and that
if this matter Is now settled there is
no reason why all teamsters should
not be employed to-morrow.
The employers nlno take the
position tluit no employe will
hereafter, directly or Indirectly,
enttagre In or nnpport any Kympa
thetlc KtrlWe or boycott. Tliey
mean by that thnt' If men In a
particular employment linvc no
icrlevnnee nualtinl their employ
ers they nliall not utrlke becnunc
Â¦ome oilier employeâ¢ fiikokpiI
in other line* of bunineaM cannot
come to terms nltlt their em
ploye*. They want every lÂ»nÂ»l
nenH to wtand on tin ovvm leas.
They nay that if employes have
any srrtevancc ngralnst their em
ployers, It Is their right nml j
duly to protest and make repre
sentations to such employers so
that they run settle tbe dispute
between themselves and If they
fail to so settle It, the employe
has the rlffut <o strike.
The employers on. their part do not
intend (and their organization refuses
to admit that they ever countenanced
such action) to refuse to sell goods to
any one who is solvent and able to pay
for them: that they will not refuse to
sell goods to any men who may havo
yielded to union demands; that when
business is on a basis of peace between
a particular employer and his employes
the employer objects to his employe*
being dragged Into sympathetic strikes
and that such strikes are only justifia
ble In open warfare.
If the teamsters understand and ac
cept these conditions, there will be no
objection to their going to work. It
is the sincere desire of the merchants
to avert trouble and to save the city
from a tie-up of Its business. The
merchants say on their part that in
every substantial respect they will
guard the interests of their employes
and promote their welfare, and point
to the fact that there is no dispute
between them on the questions .of
hours or wages.
The report was adopted "as a basis for
cettlement of the present labor difficulties
existing between the Employers' Associa
tion and the teamsters."
Messrs. Furuseth and Casey consented
to present the report to the City Front
Federation and the various unions direct-"
Iy concerned for their consideration.
the Employers' Association is that
every employer be permitted undis
turbed to employ his nelp without dis
crimination as to creed, race or mem
bership in any external organization,
and that every employe shall have the
right to labor without interference in
any situation he chooses to accept.
â¢â¢In this behalf the association in
vokes the laws of the land for the
complete protection of life, liberty and
property. Yours truly,

The Brotherhood of Teamsters assem
bled last night In the San Francisco Ath
letic Club's hall, at the corner of Sixth
and Shipley streets, for the purpose of
awaiting the result of the deliberation of
tÂ»Te City Front Federation. Almost C00 of
the teamsters attended the meeting
When it was announced by Michael Casey
of the brotherhood, who had attended trie
conference of the City Front Federation,
that that organization had. decided to
rtrike a scene of the wildest enthusiasm
ensued. Cheer after cheer was given.
Since the Inception of the strike the team
sters have been compelled to flght the
merchants and the bosses single-handed,
and It was generally admitted that the
strikers would be ignomlniously defeated
unless other unions rendered immediate
assistance. Thus the \tÂ»n had come to
look on the City Front- Federation, em
bracing the strongest combination of unit
ed labor on the Pacific Coast, as their
most desirable ally. - _
After Business Manager Casey an
nounced the decision of the City Front
Federation, the Brotherhood of Team
sters decided by a unanimous vote to light
the strike out to the bitter end without re
pard to the cost or consequences. The
brotherhood has In all almost 2000 men
now on strike
TEAMSTEBS EXPEESS DELIGHT.
"The tie-up will not prevent passengers
and freight coming to this city by ferry
boats. It is not the purpose of the Feder
ation to cause inconvenience to the travel
ing public and if it had Jurisdiction over
the men employed on these boats I doubt
whether they would have been called from
their employment. The amount of freight
sent to this city by ferry is too email to
bother about.
"The men usually sro to their work. on
the docks at 7 o'clock each morning, but
to-morrow morning they will not be In
their accustomed places. Three-fourths
of them have already been notified of the
action of the City Front Federation and
every member will abide by it. The ship
owners have only one course left open to
them, and that Is to close the cates lead
ing to their doc,ks and anchoring their
ships In the streams. The lighthouse
ships and other Government vessels will
not be hindered by us.
"We have dallied Ions: enough with the
Em plovers' Association and our action
will teach them that we mean business.
Evert* man is determined and the sooner
the association appreciates this the better
it will be for them and the business inter
ests of this city and vicinity. All the talk
has been doneâ this Is action.
The leading spirits of the strike say
that there will be â¢ no trouble along the
â¢water front. They insist that the mem
bers of the unions that are walking out
â¢will put on their best clothes and make
a holiday of it. The police are not so
confident of holiday behavior on the part
of the strikers and every policeman that
can be mustered for the duty will be as
signed to the details along the line where
trouble is most likely to occur.
The situation was not materially
changed durine the day so far as the
teamsters* strike was concerned, except,
of course, the coming of other unions to
the aid of the strikers. Secretary Renner
cf the Draymen's Association said in the
afternoon that more teams were out than
had been on Saturday. He estimated the
number at 250. There Is a rumor that men
are being imported from Arizona and
other States to act as teamsters. These
men are said to be quick in using weapons
for their own protection, and there is
some fear that blood will be shed before
the strike is terminated.
The porters and packers will cut the
sordian knot of threatened lockouts by
walking out in conformity with tho ded-
Fion of the City Front Federation, with
which their union is afliliated.
The situation in the machinists' strike
has not changed materially.
The City Front Federation Is composed
of the Sailors' I'nion of the Pacific, four

rine Firemen's Union. Brotherhood of

Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the
Sailors' Union of the Pacific, said after
the meeting:
Will Be No Trouble.
The Sierra is scheduled to sail for Aus
tralia Thursday, and her managers say
she will get away on time. The Columbia
for Portland and the Empire for Coos Bay
may possibly join the Idle fleet. On Fri
day the Coptic manned with a. Chinese
crew, will probably get away, while the
Eureka may be tied up.
At the present time there are forty-five
foreign and Atlantic vessels in port, with
a carrying capacity of over 100.000 tons.
Of these thirty-eight are engaged to load
either grain or general merchandise, and
every one of them will probably be tied
up. Of the coasting fleet over seventy of
them are now in port and not one of them
will be able to sail again while the strike
lasts.
The Robert Dollar will probably not get
away for Seattle, the Del None for Cres>
cent City nor the Gipsy for Santa Cruz.
The Kosmos liner Hermonthis will be
the only vessel to get away to-morrow, as
the Czarina and Newburg for Seattle,
Acme for Siuslaw, Pomona and Noya for
Kureka and State of California for Santa
Barbara will probably be tied up.

The steamship companies that will seri

road, Panama steamers of the Pacific
Mail, Cape Nome and coasting steamers,
colliers, and then will come the sugar and

ORDERS GENERAL STRIKE.
Continued From First Page/
The Warehousemen's Union at their
meeting last Friday night modified their
demands to 30 cents per hour, nlno hours
a day and 45 cents for overtime and Sun
days. The owners offered at the com
mencement of the strike 30 cents per hour
straight time; at a conference they of
fered 30 cents per hour and overtime after
6 p. m. at the rate of five hours per three
hours labor, but refused, to recognize the
union. As the warehousemen have never
asked for recognition of their union the
latter was easily settled. Their demands
were then modified so as to meet the own
ers half way, and as there is now only a
difference of 15 cents on nn overtime hour
a settlement will soon be reached. Secre
tary Dethlefson of the Warehousemen's
Union says:
"Since last Thursday I have expected
every moment a settlement from the own
ers. There is practically no difference be
tween us. I held five conferences last
week with the owners and modified our
demands so that an early settlement
could be reached., This morning I had a
conference with Mr. Roseman of the
Grangers' Business Association. He want
ed to settle the extra by permitting men
who did not desire to work after 5 o'clock
to quit if they so chose. I explained to
him that this would prove a bone of con
tention at all times between him and his
employes and would place him under ob
ligations to them, while on the other
hand if he granted the demands as they
stood he would be in a position to say:
'We have given you what you asked; now
you must do as we tell you or be dis
charged." He saw the logic of this and
granted the demands as they stood."
CROCKETT. July 29.â The situation of.,
the warehousemen's strike at Port Costa
looks considerably brighter at the com
mencement of its third week than at any
time heretofore. The Grangers' Ware
house this morning acceded to the de
mand of the 'employes and will resume
operations to-morro.w morning. It is
hoped that the balance of the owners will
follow the example of the Grangers' Busi
ness Association and grant the demands
of their employes within a day or two,
as there ia practically no difference be
tween them.
The submitting of the resolution was
brought about by a member of the union
who had been performing the duties' of
shipping clerk when his fellow-workmen
were locked out. He remained at work,
and through him the proprietors of the
American factory sent word to the men
that they could return to work. The men
were' willing to again pick up their tools
and resume the position they formerly
held in the shop, but will not under any
consideration arttx their signatures to an
agreement tending to disrupt the union.
They were advised to pursue this course
by President Gon! of the Labor Council,
who attended the meeting and. delivered a
speech calling upon the men to adopt con
ciliatory tactics when possible, but to re
main firm In their allegiance to their or
ganization. GofTs speech was greeted
with cheers, and when he announced that,
in his opinion, the .City Front Federation
would indorse their every action the ap
plause was tumultuous.
The membership of the Boxmakers
Union is more than 400, and. at present
every man is out.
FORT COSTA STRIKE ENDING.
The largest meeting ever held by the
Boxmakers' Union was held last night at
B'nai B'rith Hall. The men who were
locked out last Thursday all came pre
pared to discuss the troubles of the union
in their every phase, and before the meet
ing was over gave evidence that they
were prepared to meet their employers
half way. They adopted a resolution
granting- the members of the union who
formerly worked at the. American Box
Factory permission to return to work,
provided . that their former employer
would not ask them to sign any such
agreement as had been presented for their
signature during the week and would not
ask the men to perform any of the work
which was part of the work, of a team
ster.
BOXMAKERS ACT.
Two were discharged by M. Ehrman &
Co. for refusing to forsake their union
and one man was discharged by Goldstone
Brothers for the same reason. '
In discussing the strike, â¢ Robert J.
Loughery, business agent of the Porters',
Packers' and Warehousemen's Protective
Union, said:
"We are looking for peace and not for
a strike. I feel confident we have every
chance of winning in the event of an ex
tended strike. Our men are holding to
gether and will remain firm until this
lamentable trouble Is ended. At our meet
ing at the Temple last Sunday it was de
cided by a rising vote that our union
abide by the decision of the Water-Front
Federation." . , : Â¦
In consideration of your not discriminating
against, those of us who are or have been af
filiated with any labor, union, we hereby agree
to continue In your employ on the same terms
as heretofore, without any dictation from out
side organizations. â¢
Two porters were discharged at the
Yolo mills for refusing to work with non
union teamsters. â¢
Seven union and two non-union packers
were discharged by, the Armour Packing
Company yesterday morning because of
their refusal to sign an agreement which
was presented to them by the foreman
for their signatures. . The agreement
was a departure, . to a certain extent,
from the original demand of the employ
ers that the men surrender their union af
filiations, but it was considered by the
packers that the effect would be identical
and fatal to the life of the union. Tlie
agreement was worded as follows:
MUST FORSAKE UNION.
the federation were in vain. The members
of ? the union were unanimous in . wishing
that a . general strike would be ordered
and could not understand why the men of
the city front could not come to the same
conclusion without the necessity â¢ of a
lengthy session. .
Business Agent R; C. Loughery of the
Porters, Packers and Warehousemen was
attending the meeting of the delegates,
whose duty it was, according to the rules
governing organized labor, to order out
the 16,000 men employed In various 1 trades
along the. front.
The guard at the door of the union's
meeting place was the first man to re
ceive the news. When he opened the
door and announced to the anxiously
waiting laboring men that their wishes
had been granted and that on the morrow
16,000 men would quit work and enter the
ranks of the strikers and the locked-out
men the eheers were deafening. The
men yelled themselves hoarse, for the an
nouncement of the general strike meant
that their fight was to be made the fight
of every laboring man in this city.
When Business Agent Loughery arrived
at the hall he was greeted with tumultu
ous applause. He told the men of the de
liberations of, the body which had vot* J
to tie up practically all the Industries of
this city, and was cheered vociferously.
There are more than 2000 members of
the Packers', Porters' and Warehouse
men's Union. They are all engaged in the
wholesale district and their failure to re
port for work this morning will practi
cally prevent the transaction of business
in the houses in which they are employed.
While they are not looked upon as skilled
laborers, the fact remains that it will xe
quire some time to fit a green hand to
perform their duties.

NEW YORK. July 29.â The way In which the
clock market acted this morning served to dash
the hopes of the bulls among the traders, who
had Indulged a hope that some accession of
speculative interest would result from the fa
voring factors over Sunday. For two Mondays
pact the market has had to face an accumu
lation of discouraging factors which resulted in
rettllng down prices within the first hour of
trading to what proved to be the low point of
the week. This morning. In contrast, there
was the news of rains In the corn belt, about
which there waa no dispute for the first time,
as to their extent and beneficial character.
There was, besides, the new* of negotiations
and consultations between the representative*
of the t'nlted State* Steel corporation and of
the Amalgamated Association looking to the set
tlement of the strike. The opening of negotl
ctions gave strong hope of an early settlement.
The Â»lmulianfouÂ» sales of I'nltid States Steel
at thÂ« opening were of 85,000 shares at an ex
treme advance of 2 points, and a large number
Â«f the stocks thus benefited were Norfolk and
Western. Chesapeake and Ohio. Pennsylvania,
Baltimore and Ohio, New Tork Central, Fpveral
of the coalers, the Chicago and Alton Stocks,
HocVlng Valley, a number of the Southern and
Southw^Btern railroad stocks, Colorado Fuel.
American Tobacco and North American. As a
device for awakening Interest In the market
this was a failure. The opening rush to buy
was all that brought the day's dealings above
the level of activity prevailing during the lat
ter part of last week. When the" room trader*
attempted to take their profits at the end of
the day prices crumbled away and only a few
stocks had anything Jeft to show but fractional
net rains at the closing, which was dull and
heavy.
The bond market was dull and Irregular but
rather more dlverrtfled than last week. Total
sales, par value. {1.415,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. .-/ :. ".; . Â»

Business was dull on the exchanges, and the
only variation worthy of note was a decline

believing that' a fair part of the crop might
be saved, and proceeded immediately to unload
thulr holdings, with the result that September
was quoted simultaneously from 5214c to 64c,
or l%faH4c to 2 7 /i@3c under Saturday's closing
price. There watt little else to the trade save
liquidation, which was continued with consid
erable activity to noon, when there was a
perceptible decrease In the volume of offer
ings. The price was kept well under 53c nil
the session following the opening, although
thera was a fair amount of covering by trad
ers who had had the courage to Â»ell short
when lirices were at their best. During the
afternocn September waa forced to S2V4c, and
although there was a sharp rally to 52</&c, the
tap of the sung announcing the closes found
the market weak and nervous, September at
Z2"i,c, a net loss for the day of 2Vj@'2Hc.
A potent combination worked to lower wheat
values, and prices all day were clove to the
bottom level. The corn break was, of course,
the chief factor, but weak cables and bearish
statistics formed an array which together
was equally weakening. â¢ September opened

The names of W. W: Foote and William
R. Davis were presented to the City
Council to-night by the special committee
appointed to, select an attorney to assist
City Attorney Johnson in the work of
appeal in the water rates suit. The com
pensation for the lawyer who is yet to be
chosen was-fixed at $8000. Mr. Foote was
the choice of the majority of the special
committee, composed of Councilmcn
Ruch, Bon and Bishop. ' City Attorney
Johnson, who was acting with the com
mittee, presented a minority report, nam
ing Mr. Davis.
The two reports were referred, upon
motion of Councilman Courtney, to the
Ordinance and Judiciary Committee, after
Councilman Fitzgerald's motion to adopt
the minority report had been lost by the
following vote:
Ayesâ Dornin, Fitzfferald, Wallace, Wix
son; noesâ Bishop, Bon, Courtney, Ruch,
Schafer; absentâ Boyer, Cuvelller.
As soon as the majority report had been
read. City Attorney Johnson read his re
solution naming Mr. Davis, and said: "I
would very much like to have the Coun
cil act to-night on this matter, so that I
may know who shall be the attorney to
assist -me in this case. Already I have
asked for two extensions of time from
the other side and my last extension ex
pires this week. I desire that whoever
shall be chosen may Join with me at once
in starting the appeal, whether he shall
be Mr. Foote or Mr. Davis." Â»
Continuing, Mr. Johnson said Mr. Foote
was his personal friend, but that 10,000
pages of manuscript would have to be
gone through at night and Mr. Davis,
having offices in Oakland, was better sit
uated to assist in the work.
The Council adopted a resolution trans
ferring $10,000 to the general fund and $10,
000 to the high school fund. ' â¢ :
By the provisions of an ordinance intro
duced to-night the Council takes control
out of hands of the Auditor of the fund
ing of all the city's Income, holding 45 per
cent in the general fund this year for al
lotment to Other funds as the exigencies
may require.- The, only other funds for
which provision Is directly made are the
salary, police, fire and street funds. Here
tofore the funds have received their allot
ments and have been fixed at the outset
of the new fiscal year. The ordinance
went to second reading.
Councilman .Fitzgerald furnished' ihe
closing act of the session by a vigorous
attach upon,two resorts on Twelfth street,
between Broadway and Washington
streets, saying: "These places have got
to be toned down. It is , reported to me
that young girls in all stages of intoxica
tion frequent them and have been seen
going to and coming from them. The
street in front of the places is impassable.
A respectable woman cannot pass them
without fear of insult, and a man Must
fight his way through. This condition or
affairs is a disgrace and a stop must be
put to it."
The Council took no action, but Presi
dent Shaffer suggested the matter should
go before the license committee. â¢

POLICEMAN BREAKS WINDOW.
Misses the Heads of "Joshing"
Police Officer Cleveland Peters distin
guished himself yesterday morning at the
corner cf First and Brannan s?J?HÂ£ by
missing the heads of several steveabres
Â¦who were waiting to be employed on the
Mail dock and driving his club through an
expensive plate glass window in Osmer's
saloon.
Officers Peters and Owens were escorting
drays driven Jay non-union drivers. When
near the Mall dock one of the drivers
asked of the stevedores congregated there
the way to the Washington-street dock.
The men refused to give the information,
raying the drivers were "scabs." This
aroup>-d the ir.? of the officer, who was
mounted, and he drew his club and rode
into the crowd, driving the freight-hand
lers Into the numerous saloons in the
. neighborhood. The crowd was good-na
tured and chaffed the officer considerably.
Peters could net stand the "joshes" and
struck several of the men. He aimed a
blow at one of them, missed him and
smashed the large window. This aroused
the men. and angry murmurs succeeded
the "joshes," and cries of "throw the cop
per overboard" could be heard on all
sides.
Peters continued his senseless attack on
the good-natured crowd, and the affair be
gan to look serious. The officer informed
the saloon-keeper that he could "charge
the window to 'Captain Wittman," and
told the men "that they would know who
he was after he had killed a couple of
them."
The men by this time were decidedly an
gry and would have treated Peters to an
impromptu bath in the muddy water at
the foot of Brannan street had not a
prominent Mail dock official came to his
rescue and by a few words succeeded in
calming the men. Peters was then al
lowed to continue his search for Wash;

Jumped into the trough. It performed
this feat so suddenly that the horse be
came frightened and started to run. Mrs.
Merwin lost her presence of mind imme
diately, making no attempt to grasp the
reins, which were within easy reach of
her. Having nothing to guide it the horse
ran off the road and up the side of a
steep hill. Below the road was a. deep
gulch. To tip over meant death to Mrs.
Merwin, as there could be no stopping
until the bottom of the gulch was reached.
Just as it seemed certain that the cart
would- turn turtle Mrs. Pawling came to
the rescue. She had been walking along
the road with some friends and had seen
the runaway. She is large and muscular
and intrepid, and when she saw Mrs. Mer
win's peril rushed to her aid.
Bracing herself against a small rock
that stuck out of the hillside Mrs. Pawl
ing grabbed hold of- a wheel of the top
pling cart on the side which was lowest
and hold tight, at the same time crying to
Mrs. Merwin to stop the horse. The
frightened woman did as she was bidden,
and in a moment the danger was over.
Mrs. Pawling held the cart until the oc
cupant got out and then was assisted in
getting it to the road by others of the
party.
Mrs. Pawling looks upon her brave act
as nothing extraordinary. She lives with
her husband at 3212 Encinal avenue.
Mrs. Merwin and a woman friend were
driving along one of the high grades In
the neighborhood of Larkspur just pre

accusing: Jue Lin Ong of having shot him.
The boy died about 2 o'clock and his body
was removed to the Morgue.
There was trouble about property be
tween the boy's father in China and the
murderer, who arrived here from China
about four months ago to wreak his
vengeance on the boy. He remained here
about two months and left the city, re
turning Sunday night. He borrowed con
siderable money from friends in China
town and had his personal effects ready
packed to be taken away. He met the
boy in the basement of 828 Washington
street about 7 o'clock yesterday morning
and asked him if he would go with him
to locate fomc friends. As the boy turned
to go with him he fired two shots into
his back.

programme and thirteen side-wheelers
answered the bell. Martha Marshall, driv
en by Andy McDowell, was installed fa
vorite at 25 to 20 for the field. Captain
Sphinx won the ilrst heat in a drive from
Winfleld Stratton and ; Martha -Marshall.
The favorite took the next two heats, pac
ing the second in 2:07^4; reducing her rec
ord a full second. In tha fourth and fifth
heats she caused trouble while scoring
and got away badly each time, ' . giving
Nouamie and Shecan a : chance for a heat

peared for the sixth heat . and Mar - -Â»a
Marshall stepped to the front at once anrl
kept her position to the wire. v

that it had only four starters. Country

PAGING EVENTS
ON OHIO TRACK
was assassinated at Monza July 29 last by
Gastani Bresci, an anarchist) was com
memorated to-day by services throughout
Italy. Rome is the center of the observ
ances and there are 300,000 visitors here on
a pilgrimage to the tomb of King; Hum
bert, in the Pantheon. In addition, mem
bers of the royal family. Senators and
Deputies assembled at the capitol to take
part in the ceremonies.
The ceremonies commenced at 7 o'clock
this morning, when the King, Queen Hel
ena, Queen Margarita and Queen Maria
Pia (Dowager Queen of Portugal and a
princess of the house of Savoy) and the
princes and princesses prayed at the tomb
of the late King. The royal party after
ward attended mass. At 10 o'clock high
mass was celebrated, in the Pantheon,
which was imposingly decorated inside
and outside. Very conspicuous in the
oenter of the edifice stood a catafalque,
surmounted by the royal insignia and sur
rounded by innumerable wax tapers. \ De
tachments of royal cuirassiers were posted
about the building and other troops cor
doned the Pantheon Square.
Representatives of the King. the
Knights of the Order of the Annunziata,
the Cabinet Ministers, the diplomatic
corps, the state and provincial authorities,
the Senators and Deputies and many
naval and military officers were present at
the high mass.
The pilgrimage to the Pantheon occurred
at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. There was
an immense procession composed of dele
gations from all the Italian provinces and
colonies, and civil, military and labor as
sociations, with flags and bands of music.
It was estimated that over 100,000 persons
were in the parade. The most picturesque
participants were garbed in multi-colored
historic costumes. Innumerable wreaths
were carried in the procession. Enormous
crowds lined the route and the windows,
balconies and roofs were crowded to their
utmost capacity. All stores were closed
- and everywhere flags were displayed at
half-mast. As the procession entered the
Pantheon those who participated in It filed
past the vault containing the remains of
King Humbert and there deposited the
wreaths.
The ceremony will close Tuesday at the
Adriano Theater, where addresses will be
delivered.
The most noteworthy provincial celebra
tion occurred at Milan, in which city
there was a pilgrimage to Monza. the
place where King Humbert was assassin
ated. The wreaths were so numerous that
the field on which King Humbert's last
review was held was converted into a
flower garden. The first stone of the ex
pi ory chapel which is being erected by
K' g Victor -Emmanuel was laid by the
Du..e of Abruzzi, representing the King of
Italy.

R3ftgGÂ£jTiM #l/y and affecting the constitution as quickly and
"^ "".V .*r *Â¦ . rr- -' *_ Â¦ seriously as those generated within the system. Just

Lf.M%U AND Â£*fff*lÂ£>d which the poison is conveyed to the blood sys-
laS^tanESfMff* S'Trif* Â¦ tern. During the spring and summer, while
# fcl^-.vthe gtjn is m^ activ-e and the pores well
open, we are much more liable to be affected by Poison Oak and Ivy and other
dangerous plants. . Workers in "brass, copper, lead and zinc have their health im-
paired and the blood supply poisoned through; the absorption of fine particles of
these metals and the acids used in polishing and cleaning them. Inhaling the
fumes of lead give painters that pallid, waxy appearance of the skin. Barber's Itch
is another disease that reaches the blood through the skin, and is a most obstinate
one when it becomes firmly fixed in the system. After the poison has, reached the
blood and been disseminated throughout the system it is too late to resort to local
applications. In many cases the blood is affected simultaneously with the appear
ance of the rash or eruption on the skin, and all efforts should be directed to the
purification and building up of the blood. Ugly eruptions and sores will continue
to break out in spite^f salves, washes, soaps or other extsrnal treatment. '.-';
S. S. S. is especially recommended for poisons of this character. . So com-
. pletely does it destroy the effects of the Oak and Ivy that there is no possibility of
its reappearance, and it, is equally as efficacious in brass or lead poisoning or Bar-
ber's Itch ; building up and purifying the blood and driving out of the circulation
impurities of every kind, and removing every blemish, sore or eruption from the
skin. There isno substitute for S.' S. S. ; it is the only purely vegetable blood
purifier known, and the safest and best in all constitutional or blood diseases.

This statement was signed by Edward
J. White, a British soldier; Alme Van
Den Bogaerda, a Belgian, and Charles F.
Pope, a citizen of the United States.
Is either the officers of the Allegheny
nor officials of the line would make any
statement concerning the arrest of Mur
rillo. ;-. . -.-'.-.
"The captain then went on land and
after a while returned with more police
men, and we then, thought that he was
.goin^ to give up the passenger in ex
change for his papers. The police went
up. to Murrillo and tearing from him the
â¢dirty rag," as they called the flag of
Kaiser Wilhelm, took the prisoner from
the ship."
The anest did not take place at this
time, and the police withdrew on the cap
tain's, protest. Later, however, the ship's
clearance papeis were refused, and the
statement was made that they would not
be furnished until Murrillo was surren
dered. A signed statement concerning the
incident then says:
According 1 to a signed statement made
by three of the Allegheny's passengers
MHrrillo left the United States about four
months ayo on a passport signed by the
Colombian Minister at Washington. On
hia arrival at Savanilla he was arrested
and taken to Pogoto, where he waa re
leased on the understanding that he would
sail on the first vessel for the United
States. This Murrillo did, boarding the-
Alleifheny at Savanilla. He expressed
fears that he would be arrested at Carta
gena, and when the vessel arrived at that
port he refused to go ashore when word
was brought that the Governor wanted
to see him. His arrest followed. The
statement made by the passengers there
says that Captain Lowe of the Allegheny
protested against the arrest, saying it was
against International law, and at the same
time the captain told the mate to put the
German flag on the gangway so that thÂ»
Colombian officers would have to tread on
U If they took Murrillo.
According 1 to the passengers on the Al
legheny the Colombian officers, notwith
standing the protest, seized the man and
dragged him from the vessel.
"I am under the protection of the Ger
man flag and you have no right to arrest
me."'
When the vessel arrived at Cartagena
she was ordered detained by the authori
ties there. The captain protested that he
was sailing under the German flag and
that no official of Colombia had a right
to stop the vessel for any purpose what
ever. The protest was unheeded, how
ever, and search was made for Murrillo,
who was found on deck. He declared that
he would not be arrested, and running to
one of the ship's masts he seized the Ger
man flag, which was lyingr there,, and
wrapped it about him. Then he * ! ?od for
ward and cried out:
NEW YORK, July Â».-The Hamburg-
American line steamer Allegheny, which
arrived here to-day, reported that she
was held In the harbor of Savanilla. Co
lombia, for twelve hours. Passengers on
the Allegheny report that Abel Murrlllo
was arrested on the ship at Cartagena
and was taken ashore by the Colombian
authorities. Murrillo protested against his
arrest, claiming that he was entitled to
the protection of the German flag. Mur
rillo is said to be the secretary of Gen
eral Uribe.

for the members of the San Francisco

was enthusiastically received. To cele

and celebrate in an informal manner. Ac

the rest of the evening was given up to
pleasure. An impromptu programme, con

proved highly entertaining.

Opal Morris, a pretty, blue-eyed child
of 8 years, pleaded on bended knees be
fore Judge Dunne yesterday morning to
be permitted to remain with Mrs. Schwab
at -11 Julian avenue, who has cared* for
her since last May, when her mother,
Magpie Morris, died. The child's father.
Guy Morris, disappeared about two years
agj and the mother was forced to support
herself and child.
Finally Mrs. Morris was taken ill and
died. James W. Barnetr of Stockton, the
child's grandfather, recently applied for
letter? of guardianship upon the person
and estate of his little granddaughter.
The petition for letters came up before
Judgt- Dunne yesterday. The child rose
painfully from her seat, being affected
with spinal trouble, and pleaded in a pit
eous strain that she might be left witn
Mrs. Schwab, whom 6he .called her
mothc-r.
Suddenly the little girl dropped to her
knecp and with uplifted hands implored
the court to permit her to remain with
"he*- mother."
All m the courtroom were visibly affect
ed, but Judge Dunne had no alternative
but to grant the petition for letters. An
order was made, however, permitting the
child to remain with Mrs. Schwab for a
month or two. and in all probability she
â¢â¢fill be permitted to remain longer, if she
expresses the desire.

Nineteen- Year-Old-- Vincent Biasioli Becomes Incendiary,
Hoping to Secure Insurance Money ;That Would Enable
Him to Wed Beautiful Fannie Rousseau, Whom He Adores
Besides his wife he leaves two daugh
ters and two sons, one of whom, William
.E. Mills, is living at his father's old home
stead in Quincy. Piumas County.
The late Professor Le Conte, of whom
he was a close friend, was a student at
Harvard at aDout the same time as Mr.
Mills and took the degrees in the same
school of science. Both had the same
epiritual nature, and science only seemed
to intensify their love of God and rever
ence for his works. Professor Davidson
was also intimately acquainted with Mr.
Mills, cf whose work he could doubtless
tell much that would be of Interest.
Alexander Agassiz one day remarked to
Mr. Mills that his father had said that
the old water courses of the Sierras cross
each other at Ftrange angles, and that
there would be found the most Interesting
geological formation on the face of the
earth, and that Mills was the one man
to investigate it and solve the problem.
About twenty years ago he established a
geological survey at his own expense, and
the result of his labors are maps show-
Ing in detail ani accurately the formation
of the Sierras, the changes of the water
courses and ths causes thereof. He deliv
ered an address on the subject before the
Geological Society in this city several
years ago.
Deceased was born at Bangor, Me., Feb
ruary 13, 3834. He was a son of Dr. P. B.
Mills, a prominent physician, and a broth
er of Hiram F. Mills, the hydraulic en
gineer and expert in sewerage, than whom
there is not a l.Â« tter known man in scien
tific circles :n Massachusetts. When
IS years old James E. Mills went to Bos
ton and entered the Lawrence Scientific
School of Harverd. over which the elder
Agasslz presided. He took the degree of
S. B. six years later, and in the same
year was ordaired a minister of the Swe
denborgian church. He occupied a pulpit
in Brooklyn for three years, when com
pelled to resign because of failing health.
He became a mining geologist and was
soon engaged in most important work for
the elder Agassiz, and after his death for
his son. Alexander Agassiz, in whose em
ploy he was at the time of his death.
James E. Mills, the noted geologist, who
was a classmate and life-long friend of
the l&te Professor Joseph Le Conte,
passed away last Saturday at Culiacan,
Mexico. The sad news was received yes
terday by James H. Barry, but no details
as to the cause of death were given.

A most Interesting paper was read yes
terday by Rev. Dr. E. H. Avery at the
weekly meeting of the Presbyterian Min
isterial Union, the subject Â«f the paper
being "The Bible, What Is It?"
In presenting theyaddress, the speaker
dwelt upon six mest important facts,
namely; That the Bible furnishes a mass
of highly important historical data, un
obtainable elsewhere in literature; that
the work extending through fifteen cen
turies shows a remarkable harmony of
thought; that the writings present a code
of laws, perfect and unapproachable: that
the Scriptures present a knowledge of
events still deep in the future; that the
writers distinctly claim divine guidance
and that the Savior recoRniaed the Old
Testament as the word of God. A. dis
cussion folio-wed th# reading of the paper.
At the weekly meeting of the Methodist
Church Union an address was delivered
by the Rev. Dr. Thirkield, corresponding
secretary of the Freedmen's v Aid and
Southern Educational Society. The sub
ject of the address, was "On the Relation
of the Negro Race to the Conversion of
the World." The speaker handled the
subject in a forceful manner and was list
ened to with marked attention. Regular
meetings were also held yesterday by the
pastors of the Baptist and Congregational
churches. .

VINCENT BIASIOLI, lj? yeafs old
and very much in love with; Miss
Fannie Â¦ Rousseau, occupies & Â¦ cell |
in the Hall of Justice with an
ugly charge of arson booked
against him. Vincent made a very raw
attempt early yesterday -morning to- set
fire to a flat occupied, by him at 425 Bart
iett street, his object being to collect the
$200 for which the place was" insured and
thereby be financially in a position to wed
the object of his affections.
Biasioli went about the business of set
ting fire to his flat in a very amateurish
fashion. About 1 o'clock he poured a can
of coal oil all over the.basement floor and
took some coal oil-soaked rags and hung
them alcng the walls. Then he put a
match to the rags and waited for the
place to burn. Just as the fire was gain
ing headway Mr. Kane, who lives in the
adjoining house, came up the street and,
seeing- the flames,' proceeded to call for
assistance. Biasioli came out in .answer
to his cries and helped him to fight the
fire. To Kane the youth explained that
the fire must have been the work of burg
lars.
Shortly after 5 o'clock Biasioli made an
other attempt to fire the house. This time
he chose the parlor and bedroom of his
flat as* the scene of action and poured coal
oil over the bedsheets and on the cur
tains'that adorned the parlor windows.
When the flames began to spread the
young incendiary went out and roused his
At first Biasioli absolutely refused to
speak of the lady for the sake of whose
love he sinned. "She has nothing to do
with it." he said. "I alone am to blame.
If she had knov/n that I was going to do
what I did F am sure she -would have told
me not to, â¢ s
"How shWl I ever face her people?" he

Young Biasioli is a comely youth, just
turned 19. His skin is fair and his cheeks
pink, just like a girl's. His hair is brown
and curly, and his large brown eyes fill
and solash over when he tellg the story
of his crime, just like a child's.
"I do not know what possessed me to do
such a thing," said the youth. "The idea
came into my head on Friday night when
I heard the lire bells ring. I am engaged
to be married, and I thought if I had the
$200 for which my flat was insured I might
be wedded right away.
"I never for a moment realized what an
awful crime I was committing," went on
the youth, sobbing as if his heart would
break. "I never did anything wrong In
my life before, and I hope the law will
take pity on me and give me another
chance." -*â¢'Â« â¢'Â»Â£â¢-

their club to the secretarypf .the associa

E. G. Sloman. one of the delegates of
the California Cricket Club, introduced a
motion that the Alameda Club, having in
cluded in its team a player who left the
Californias when not in good standing,
forfeit all its matches for the pennant
played during the present season. After a

from San Francisco. The meeting on the
General Frisbie was informal and that
was the reason that no action was taken
during the trip. The course adopted by
the San Francisco Board of Trade will re
sult in having all the influence that can
be secured back of the action of the com

dock at the yard and also 'the deepening
of the water over the San Pablo flat, that
warships may find no difficulty in going
to. the yard freely. The contract for the
dry dock only awaits the signature of the
Secretary of the Navy, having been pre
pared under the direction of a naval board
and having been accepted as entirely sat
isfactory by the contractors, who .are
ready to go to work at once. The other
project, the deepening of the water, has
