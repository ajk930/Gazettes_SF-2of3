On his release he decided to cursa
America with his presence and- sailed- fo?
New York in December, 1S82. Immediately
on his arrival he began his incendiary
work by lecturing and publication, which
he has continued with little interruption
ever since. For a speech made at the
time of the Haymarket explosion in Chi
cago he was sentenced to a year on the
Island, which is the worst and longest of
the two terms of punishment the over
patient authorities have seen fit to accord
him. though his mouth has ever bee.n !

Special Dispatch to' The CalL
.-Â« wEW YORK, Sept. 12.â Dr. Georga
|\ I 'F.V Shrady, in the Medical Re
1^1 view, describing the operation* i
I .-^yon : President McKinley, says: Vj
"I ;".^ r --'The illustrious patient stood:
Â¦^ ;â¢Â»_â¢ the ether and operation well, his
.' . : .'pulse at its termination being
130 and of good quality. There has been
at no time any symptom of peritonitis or
of septic poisoning. The pistol used was,
fortunately, one of slight penetrating
power,' and it was of small caliber, other
wise the ball would have struck the
sternum- 'â¢ arid almost certainly thera
would have been far greater damage than
that which perforated the stomach, even
had it not caused instant death.
; "A very remarkable feature of the
operation w&s its performance so soon af
ter the infliction of the injury, and in this
respect it'may be looked upon as unique.
Fortunately, in consequence mainly of
the careful handling of the patient be
fore the operation, only a very small
amount of stomach contents escaped into
the . peritoneal cavity. Viewed by Itself
as a surgical procedure it may be con
sidered beyond criticism. In fact it was
demonstrating to the public one of many
triumphs of modern surgery.
"It- Is most gratifying to. state at the
present writing that the distinguished
patient is in a fair way to complete re
covery. The only trouble now centers
in the present uncertainty as to the lo
cation of the bullet. Although believed to
be lodged in the muscles of the back
somewhere in the lower dorsal or upper
lumbar region, there has been no means
as yet of proving such a point. Of course,
every hope now rests in the probability of
the muscles becoming safely encysted and
consequently harmless. It is somewhat
difficult to understand why, upon this
writing, the X-ray,. so easily and effec
tually applied, has not been brought into
service. It Is to be hoped that the bul- '
let's course behind and beyond the stom
ach is in a safely-closed and aseptic con
dition. This would seemingly be the only
absolute guarantee against any further
trouble from a. secondary suppurating
process. But whatever theories may be
offered as to the precise nature of the
injury, they can be very harmlessly ven
tilated in the face of the gratifying fact
that the patient seems destined to recover
and valiantly defy them alL"
Vienna on May 2, 1872, the authorities de
creed his banishment and he was sent
across the Saxon frontier. The Saxon po
lice would not permit him to. make public
speeches and so he worked privately Â»n
the homes of the workingmen. - - - â¢ '-"-:
Becoming editor of the" Chemnitz- Etoe'
Presse, he made such incendiary attacks
on the authorities that he was summoned
to court forty-three times in one year and
punished eighteen times by fine or impris
onment. â¢ -
About this time Most won the love of a
beautiful girl and married her, soon after
going to live at JIayence. He says that
he had "no time for hearthstone mus
ings," and after leading his wife^a hard
lite he deliberately- and cruelly sacrificed
his family for his party, and in IS80 gave
her up. She died in 1S82, three children
having died before.
By 1875 Most had become an out-and-out
anarchist. He went to Berlin and was
elected to the Reichstag. In 1ST7 he was
again elected. He was several timea in
prison for various offenses. "In May
when the anarchist Hoedel shot at the
German Emperor, Most in a public speech
applauded the act and was sent to prison
for six weeks. He passed his time writ
ing anarchistic books, of which, he had>
now published many. â¢ . . Â¦
In 1S7S the socialist law proscribing cer
tain literature was passed and Most'a
books headed the "index." He -was or
dered out of the country and. went to
Hamburg and thence to London, where in
January, 1879, he began the publication of
the "Freiheit," in which on the occasion j
of the assassination of Czar Alexander It"
he exulted and declared that "all- tyrants -
must soon be served in the same man
ner," and running a deep- red border
around his paper. He was arrested and
sent to Cler ken well Prison for sixteen
months. â¢ . -t ; -..-,.

BTTFFALO. Sept. 12.â The District
Attorney here announced pub
licly this afternoon that he had
no evidence against Emma Gold
man and that unless some
turned up no requisition upon
the State of Illinois would be
made for her. This does not mean that
the bottom has dropped out of the con-
Epiracx theory. It simply means that no
evidence has yet been secured to connect
her with the. crime. . If she is released
she will be kept under the closest surveil-
Irnce, and it will be easy for the authori
ties to place their hands upon her if she
is wanted later.
There is a hope here, however, that
some way will be found to hold | her, at
least until investigations now in progress
by the secret service people in all the
principal cities where anarchist organiza
tions exist are completed. She was ar
rested wholly upon the responsibility of
the Chicago police under the general or
der sent out by Superintendent Bull to ap
prehend all persons who might have
knowledge of the attempted assassination.
While no evidence has been found against
the Goldman woman, the official is satis
fied that Caolgosz crossed her path and in
due time, it is believed, whatever connec
tion, if anv. there was between them will
be discovered. The secret service men
will trace Czolgosz's whereabouts back
step by step. One of the things which is
fU'fcired is a complete report of the lec
tures the President's assailant said in
spired him to commit the deed.

Early in the Evening the Reports
Are Not Grave.
BUFFALO, Sept. 12.â Six days have
now elapsed since the President was shot
and this afternoon he complained some
what of fatigue. That was the only dis
quieting word which came from
tne sick room during the day.
The President had had a restful night, '
and the beef juice which the doctors gave
him last night had ' been relished "so
keenly that this morning he was given
solid food for the first time. He was
then bathed and enjoyed a bowl â¢ of
chicken broth, toast .and coffee. He felt
eo good after this somewhat substantial
meal that he asked for a mild cigar. Â¦
Dr. "McBurney, the head of the corps
of * attending physicians and surgeons;
was thoroughly satisfied with the pa
tient's condition and went to Xew York
at 1 o'clock to look after some urgent pri
vate affairs. His intention is to return
in a few days. Meanwhile he will keep
in constant touch with the Milburn house
and be prepared to come back at a mo
ment's notice. Secretary Hoot left on
the same train.

charged him and he at once left the city
for a time.. On his return four months
later he was arrested and sentenced to a
term in prison. There he formed the ac
quaintance of Oberwlnder. BerkarScheu,

were gathered under the gaslight in front
of the white tents erected for the accom

Above the suppressed tones . of the
watchers the only sound was the click of
the telegraph instruments inside. Out of
the gloom into the circle of light came
the P-fesident's secretary, accompanied by
Mr Milburn. The secretary was imme

of encouragement with the little type

President Building Trades - Council.
O. A. TVEITMOE, Secretary.
The following are the resolutions
adopted by the Cement Workers:
tion at the attempted assassination.
The resolutions of the Building Trades
Council are as follows: ,
retary Cortelyou and Mr. Milburn re
turned to the house. Soon afterward the
lights in the lower part of the house,
which shortly before were burning bright
ly, were put out, except in the drawing
room, which for the time being is used
by Mr. Cortelyou for. official purposes.
Members of the bar as officers of the court
should be loyal to the court. Where there is
a fair reason for believing the Judge is acting
Improperly it is the duty of the -bar to declare
it openly, but a member of the bar is faith
less, to his high calling when he assails a
Judge and impeaches his integrity upon no
facts even remotely justifying the attack, but
upon vague suspicion and unfair innuendo.
That these and many of the charges against
Judge Humphreys to which allusion has been
madewern nreferred by members of his own
court clearly shows the difficulties of. his posi
tion and -the severity of the ordeal through
Wiich be has passed. It Is obvious that the
task will not be an easy one,, and where Judges
selected by you discharge their - duties with
courage and integrity and reasonable ability
they. i should be sustained, even though they
mar>*n attempting to solve the difficult prob
lems which present' themselves at times err.'
some consideration must be had for the diffi
culty of their position.
Having fully considered the complaint!
against Judge Humphreys and his answer
thereto. I am entirely satisfied that not only
the Judge - has done nothing which would jus
tify his removal, but that he has met heavy
responsibilities with treat courage and * un
questioned intecrity; I therefore recommend
that the petition for his . removal be denied..
In conclusion the Attorney General says
The conclusion reached is that Judge
Humphreys has done nothing which
would justify his removal. The Attorney
General finds that some of the charges
were not satisfactorily established,- and
as to the others that they were purely
matters of innuendo, utterly without jus
tification in fact and reckless and intem
perate in spirit. ,

the reports by the commander in

various committees. The proceedings of
the convention were prefaced with the
adoption of a resolution offered by Gen
eral Daniel Sickles tendering to the Pres
ident the affectionate congratulations of
the Grand Army of the Republic upon his
rapid convalescence. The. resolution was
embodied in a telegram, which was im
me<lia.tely sent to Mr. McKinley at Buf-
The commander in chief, Leo Rassieur,
devoted a large part of his annual ad
dress to the matter of pensions.
"Without any effort," Â¦, he said, on the
part of the organization or its officers to
give the pension problem any undue
prominence the subject has overshadowed
all others and has called for more atten
tion and thought in the past year than
all other questions which concern us.
He criticized the administration orthe
Pension Bureau and demanded ' the hon
est and fair administration of laws
which are already on the statute books.
Continuing, he said:
"If an officer's lawlessness, recklessness
and boldness go to such extreme length
as to lead him to override and ignore a
plain and unmistakable order, indicating
the line of his duty, under the law. com
ing from his superior officer, the Secretary
of the Interior, what can the poor and
helpless old soldier expect at his hand3
when he is claiming to exercise his dis
cretion under the law? The exercising of
his discretion cannot possibly result in
anything else in most of the cases than
a positive denial of the benefits prescribed
?by the law." -'
After adverting to the Importance of
judicial assistance in the administration
of the Pension Bureau and answering ob
jections to the G. A. R. bill, having this
object in view, the commander in chief

SAN JOSE. Sept. 12.â The Retail Clerks'
Association of this city, at a special meet
ing this evening, which Â¦was largely at
tended, adopted resolutions ' denouncing
the attack upon thelife of President Mc-
Kinley and extending its sympathy to
Mrs.' McKinley. "Yellow" journalism was
held in part responsible for the attack of
Czoigosz and was severely condemned, as
were all anarchists and their followers.
The resolutions follow: , .
The roll was numerously signed by the
veterans who have been in camp. for the
past ten days and whose exercises have
all savored :of the same feeling since the
day of the assault on the person of the
President.
To-night there was formed at- the. camp
grounds of the Veterans' ;Assbciation, of
Loyal Americans, "of : which association
all. truly loyal Americans may, become
members under .such conditions as. may
hereafter be prescribed, and who will
pledge. themselves with us under. oath to
use every endeavor to procure the passage
of a law expelling from the United States
all persons known'or shown, to be '.or who
asknowledge themselves to be anarchists."
The closing address was by W. W. "Bow
ers, Collector of the Port. of San Diego,
who after devoting a few minutes to the
encampment and its success 7 turned '.his'
attention to the crime at Buffalo' which
had come so near cutting short all the
pleasures of the encampment- here'/ He
declared that it is the auty of the United
States to handle the anarchist question.
"There is no -middle ground," he said..
"Either the Government must succumb or
the anarchist murderers be driven out.
We might take Czoigosz and his pistol
and drown them in the depths of the sea
and 'only the two instruments of the as
sassins would be disposed of, while the
real assassins would escape unscathed.
The real assassins are not only, the ack
nowledged anarchists, but they Â¦ are "the
men and women of the 'yellow' journals
who inflame the ignorant mind by attacks
upon the Government' which protects
them. These are the real assassins with
whom we have to deal, and the man \vlio
in any way supports, sustains or approves
of the vicious brutes is. an accessory and

examination proved to be one of the most
interesting features of the day's proceed
ings. R-iynor pressed his question persist
ently, but the .-admiral did not at any
time compromise in his contention that he
was competent to sit as a Judge in this
inquiry. Before the questioning began
Admiral .Howisoc. remarked that he did
not desire to go into, any private discus
8ion, to which Raynor replied: "I will not
go into any private matters at all, ad-
I miral, but tho matter of whether or not
you had those conversations with these
gentlemen is one which we -will have to
go into. I will net encroach at all on any
thing that is improper. I will be very
careful about ..that, because this Is no im
peachment of your capacity or integrity
either. It is merely a question of whether
your mind is made up on certain subjects
fin connection with this matter."
He then asked the admiral concerning
'Frost's statement that he (Howison) had
said that Admiral Sampson deserved the
credit for winning the battle of Santiago
"I want to know, . ho added, "whether or
not you ever said that to Mr. Frost."
"Maybe I did," the admiral replied, re
flectively, and continued: "If he was com
mander in chie'-i-probably did say soâ not
only to Mr. Frost, but to "others. I am
merely talking now of the nai'y orders
and regulations â¢ and the , customs and
commands of the service."

opposite side, Â¦ and in Â¦ his : effort ' to : show
that Admiral, Sampson' was not a flt.man'
for that position had remarked that the
.Witness said that in response to an in
quiry from himself. Admiral Howison had
explained the absence of Admiral Samp
son from the /scene of action when the
Santiago naval battle occurred, by say
ing: "The explanation is that there haii
been a lack of co-operation- be'tween; the
land. and naval" forces and Sampson- was
trying "to harmonise them. â¢ The day on
which the battle occurred' wae- the last
day on earth when -the Spanish â¢ fleet
should have been expected to como out."
Judge Advocate Â¦ Lemly at this point
maintained, that: Admiral Howisoo could

before 6r after the arguments. --

however. - by reaching' forward for | his

â¢The' court- remained absent. ;fromi 'the
*om for. about fifteen minutes, and when
-it- reconvened Admiral' Howison presented
'his; reply ' to the â¢ charges -made against
himself. Hip statement was typewritten
andwas as follows: -
Spon was immediately succeeded by
Foster Nicholls of Yonkers. N. Yl, which
is Admiral Howison's place of residence.
Nicholls is interested in naval publica
tions, and in thia capacitv called upon
Admiral Howison in July last for the pur
pose of securing from him notes for a
biography of the admiral. He stated that
the day on which the call, was made was
very hot and that on this account the ad
miral had asked to be excused from
granting an interview. Nicholls said that
after this conversation he had procured
a copy of the work which his house was
getting out containing a sketch of the
leaders in the Spanish- American war and
containing, pictures of Sampson and
Schley. The witness said- that at the sight
of Scnley's picture Howison said Schley
had -no business in the navy, and added
thatif Schley were in the English navy
he would have been put out "for less
cause than the? e was' in hi3 case." "j* . *
"I asked," tho witness continued, "the
reason why. Schley should have been put
out.^ Admiral Howison replied, Â¦ 'For diso
bedience of orders." I asked why, if he
disobeyed orders, he was permitted to re
main: The admiral replied : 'Because he
gave the excuse that he had to go to i
port to .coal, yet everybody knows that |
coaling at sea is possible.' "
lh.e. witness said that he had expressed
surprise at Admiral .Howison's attitude,
and that in reply the admiral had said:
\ "You would not be surprised if you were
in touch with the sentiment among naval
officers.'.'. . â¢ .' ..Â¦ - ...' ... .\
Said Schley Disobeyed Orders.
admiral had been the last member of the
board of ordnance to agree to the use of
smokeless powder by the navy. Continu
ing. Spon said that Admiral Howison
came within hearing of the controversy
at this point and walking up to the group
said: .
"I correct you; this is not so. You men
do not know what you are talking about.
You do not know anything about it.
Sampson is very much respected and
looked up to, and especially ' by the
younger men of the navy."
Continuing, the witness said that some
colloquy followed, after which Admiral
Howison had said: "Anyhow, Schley
should have been court-martialed. He
was the main cause of all this contro
versy in the newspapers." ' . Â¦
Spon added that Admiral Howison had
seemed much excited during this conver
sation, and that the. other members of the
party had listened In silence to what he
had to say. "From his whole manner,"
the witness wont on, "I infer that be was
a violent partisan of Sampson and corre
spondingly, prejudiced against Schley. He
was not content to correct me as to Ad
miral Sampson, but seemed willing to say
bitter things, almost vindictively, against
Admiral Schley." , -
The proceedings of the court began
with the reading by Captain Lemly, of
Admiral Schley's letter requesting the
convening of the court and the Navy De
partment's precept.
Â¦ The court assumed a listening attitude,
but Admiral Schley, known as the "appli
cant" In the case, gave only indifferent
attention to .the document. The admiral
gave closer attention, however, when the
judge advocate began â¢ reading the order
appointing Rear Admiral Â¦ Howison a
member of the court in place of Rear Ad
miral Kimberly, and he continued to give
careful heed when his letter to the-de
partment, asking for a modification Â¦â¢ of
paragraph five of the precept regarding
Admirp.l Schley's, disobedience', of orders
was read, together with the department's
refusal to comply with the request. :â¢" \ .
None- of the documents received Â¦ more
than perfunctory attention from 'the
auditors; but there was a general change
of attitude when the order of proceeding
was reached. V 'Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ â¢'
Admiral Schley arose and said that

"And you have no recollection of your
saying anything on that voyage on the
subject of the . Sampson-Schley contro
vers?" asked Raynor. â¢-
'Â¦ "I do not remember what I said" re
plied the admiral. "I may have said
something on that voyage; I do answer
any one's questions if they are asked po
litely, where it does not make any differ
ence.**, , - - . Â¦
"Do you not recollect saying on that
voyage to any one that if Schley had
done certain things he ought to have been
court-martialed?"
Rear Admiral Howison replying said:
'iso, I do not lemember making any such
remark. But if â¢ some one, for instance,
should come to me and say that a certain
officer had dona a certain thing I might
say that under the navy regulations he
would be subject to court-martial or dis
cipline of some sort if he had done a cer
tain wrong. I would not hesitate to say
that to you at any time, or to anybody
else."
Taking up the testimony of Nicholls,
Raynor called Admiral Howison's atten
tion to the fact that in his formal reply
he had not denied the statements of that
witness. The admiral said he had never
said to Nicholls that Schley had no busi
ness In the navy, or that a man could not
remain in the English navy under such
circumstances. "I never made any such
remark as that about Admiral Schley. If
anything of the kind occurred it was just
as I stated in my answer to you before.
If he (Nicholls) had stated to me that
Admiral Schley had positively disobeyed
orders or done something that he ought
not to have done, that was liable to disci
pline, I would have said he should be
brought before a court-martial. That.i&fc
simply one of the regulations of the ser- '
vice."
Raynor (interrupting)â He says "I ex
pressed surprise that he should feel this
way toward Schley, and he said: 'You
would not if you were in touch with the
sentiments among naval officers." "
Rear Admiral Howisonâ Well, how In
the world could a stranger to me, coming
to my house on his own business, get me
to speak in such a way as that unless
It were to answer some question or unless
he misinterpreted my answers to him? I
have not the slightest desire to force my
self on this court. I do not want to sit
on it. It is not agreeable duty for me.
I have no desire whatever to ' do it and
I am not making any excuses for myself
or for any of my private discussions with
any one. I think that is my own affair
and nobody else is asked about these pri
vate discussions. It is only this one ob
jectionable man. I am perfectly willing
to get out, as I say in my letter
"But are you willing to ask the court
to relieve you?"
"I cannot ask the court to relieve me
because they have got to do that upon
the merits of the case." ,
Then ensued a long controversy be
tween Raynor and Admiral Howison as
to the qualification as judge of one who
recognized Sampson as commander In
chief at the battle of Santiago and en
titled to credit for the victory..
Schley and the Santiago Campaign.
The Judge Advoeate^May I ask what
feature of the precept Is referred to with
regard to winning the battle of Santiago "Â»
Mr. Raynorâ It is involved in three of
the specifications. I think, if you will look
at these specifications. The first specifi
cation directs the court to inquire Into
"his conduct in connection with the event3
of the Santiago campaign." Now, if tho
conduct of Admiral Schley at the battle
of Santiago is not an event in copnectiori
with the Santiago campaign, I would like
to know what is.
The Judge Advocate-The conduct oi
Admiral Schley is in question not only at
the battle of Santiago but in the wnole
Santiago campaign. But I may as wÂ«*tl
say here, Mr. President and members cf
the court, that the question of Admiral
Sampson's conduct upon those occasions
is not before this court In any way Thi*
is not a comparative question as to
whether some one did or did not do better
than Commodore Schley. It is a question
â¢as to whether Commodore Schley did his
whole duty in the Santiago campaign and
at the battle of SantiagofandThe |?neral
question as to whether some other officer
of the navy is a better man than Commo
dore Schley, or not so good a man. is not
tne point.
Mr Raynorâ We intend to prove that
Admiral Sampson was not at the battle
of Santiago at all. -and it .becomes a
question of who was the commander-in
ch . ef , the battl e of Santiago. If Ad
miral Sampson was not there, then Ad
. miral Schley was the commander-in-chief.
And if a judge of this tribunal has al
ready made up his mind that Admiral
Sampson, as . commander-in-cbief , won
that battle, it becomes a very pertinent
inquiry under the specification as to what
was the conduct of Schley . darter the
Santiago campaign. That will be one of
the questions involved hereâ not a com
parison between Schley and Sampson, but
as to who was practically, legally; offi
cially and technically the commander at
the battle of Santiagoâ to whom credit is
due. if. as the admiral has said, credit
is due to the officer who was in charge.
If there has been an opinion expressed
on that point of cflurse we want to know
it, and we want to know tr It Is such an
opinion as to throw upon, us the burden
of proof. Now, I will ask you. Admiral
Howison. whether you have not, in con
versations with anybody else, at times''
expressed yourself upon the proposition
that Admiral Sampson was in command
at Santiago and deserves the credit for
that victory?
a In reply to this and further questions
Admiral Howison stated that he looked
upon Sampson as commander In chief of
the squadron, but the credit for the vic
tory would depend upon what he did or
did not do.
Admiral Howison said any conclusion
would depend on official reports, and then
in answer to further questions, the ad
miral said that he had discussed the con
troversy in many conversations durinÂ°
the past three years on the basis of news
paper reports. Some things he had said
were , favorable to Schley and some to
Sampson.
He never had said that Schley was hot
beaded and Impetuous, for he never nad,
thought him hot-headed or nervous The'
testimony having been closed, Raynor In
a few words called attention to the fact
that the statements made by the wit
nesses had not been denied.
Raynor having referred to Nicholls*
statement as to what Admiral Howlaon
had said concerning Schley and the Eng
lish navy and also coaling at sea. Admiral
Howison interrupted with very positive
disclaimers that he ever could have made
either statement. They must have been
some one else's statements.
Following Raynor"s arraignment of Ad
miral Howison as a member of the court
that body took a brief recess to consider
the matter.
When it returned Admiral Dewey
promptly said:
"I have to announce that the objection
of the applicant to Rear Admiral Howi
son is sustained by the court. ' .The Ad- ,
miral Is excused from serviceâ for which,;
I know, he is very glad."
Rear Admiral Howisonâ I am, indeed.
The court then, at 3:45 p. m.. adjourned
to await the appointment of a successor
to Admiral Howison by the Navy Depart
ment
Admiral Howison's arrival passed al
mest unnoticed, as he has been here so
little of late that the knots of observers
did not immediately recognize him.
It was just twenty minutes before the
court was to convene that a large auto
mobile came up to the building with Ad

The distinguished naval officers who
are to participate in the proceedings
began to put in an appearance about
12:20 o'clock. They came quietly and
without any outward demonstration of
saluting guns and marching guards of
honor. *Â¦Â¦>.- .
Captain Lemly, judge advocate, was
the first official to arrive. He came in
with his assistant. E. P. Hanna. a few
minutes after II o'clock, and they were
soon busily engaged in unpacking two or
three large boxes of books which it is
expected will be called Into frequent use
for reference during the sitting of the
court.
The decision came s=o quickly and um
expectedly. that it sent a flutter of agi
tation through the courtroom. There was
a buzz of animated comment anoUAdmiral
Schley exchanged looks of satisfaction
with his counsel.
Admiral Dewey at once closed the pro
ceedings by announcing that the court
would adjourn indefinitely until the Navy
Department had named an officer to suc
ceed Admfral Howison.
Court Sustains the Challenge.
After hardly more than fifteen minutes
spent in retirement in the consultation
room of the court Admiral Dewey briefly
announced that the court sustained the
challenge and said that Admiral Howison
would be excused from further attend
ance.
Before submitting the challenge to the
determination of the court Raynor cross
examined Admiral Howiscn very minute
ly as to his personal sentiments toward
Admiral Sampson and Admiral Schley
and developed that Admiral Howison had
expressed certain definite convictions as
to Admiral Sampson's retention of au
thority and responsibility, even while he
Â¦was absent temporarily from the fleet
at Santiago. The challenge then was
submitted to the court, which, under the
circumstances, was narrowed down to
Admiral Dewey and Rear Admiral Ben
ham to pass upon.
It was not sufficient, however, to coun
teract the very direct testimony given by
the three witnesses, and, moreover, the
admiral himself, in concluding his state
ment, indicated plainly that he had no
desire to remain on the court and was
there simply in obedience to orders. He
then appealed to his associates on the
court to decide all doubtful questions as
to his eligibility in favor of- Admiral
Echley.
The first skirmish was opened by Ad
miral Schley rising from his. seat and.
speaking in a strong voice, calmly and
deliberately, challenging Admiral Howi
son"s eligibility as a. member of the court.
Three witnesses were brought forward in
support of this challenge, namely, Fran
cis S. Frost. William E. Spon and Foster
Xicholls. They gave positive testimony
as to the expressions they had heard Ad
miral Howison make, favorable to Ad
miral Sampson and unfavorable to Ad
miral Schley. '
Frost testified to a statement Admiral
Howison had made to him at Boston
while the witness was seeking news as a
reporter, Spon to remarks made while he
and the admiral were journeying back to
this country from Europe on a trans-
Atlantic steamer, and Nicholls* conversa
tion occurred during a business call at
Admiral Howlson's private residence at
lonkers, N. T. - â¢ Â¦
In concluding this testimony the ques-
Uon arose whether Admiral Howison
would join issue on the statements made
by the . witnesses or would rest on Kis
privilege to withhold an answer until he
chose to submit it. The admiral met the
issue by turning at once to Admiral
Dewey and announcing that he would
make a written rejoinder to the state
ments pf the three witnesses. This re
joinder lie prepared very speedily. While
conceding the accuracy of some points
in the evidence, it threw considerable
doubt en other points and disclaimed any
recollection of the talks said to have
taken place on the trans-Atlantic
steamer.
Challenges HLowison's Eligibility.
Washington; Sept. 12.â
"Within three hours from the
time of the convening of the
court of inquiry to-day it was
announced that Rear Admiral
Howison was disqualified
from serving as a member of
the court. He was excused from further
duty. This brought the proceedings to
an abrupt termination and caused a tem
porary adjournment of the court In order
to permit the Navy Department to desig
nate an officer to succeed Admiral Howi
son- No further session is probable until
the early part of next week.
It had been expected that little official
business would be accomplished on the
opening day, and the prompt decision as
to Admiral Howison came somewhat as a
surprise.
Prior to the court's convening a good
sized crowd assembled at the Washing
ton Navy Yard, where the court met, to
â¢witness the coming of the prominent
naval officers who are to take part in the
proceedings. They came ununiformed
and unheralded, and till the full dress
uniforms had been donned at Quarters ln
elde the yard for the actual session of the
court there was little to lend dramatic
Interest to the occasion. Admiral Dewey
and Admiral Schley naturally were the
premier figures in popular interest The
latter had about him a distinguished body
of counsel. Including Jere Wilson, Attor
ney General Isadore Raynor of Maryland
and Captain James Parker, with Mr.
Teague acting as advisory counsel. The
German naval attache. Captain Rebeur-
Paschwitz, occupied one of the seats in
the public area. The number of wives of
naval officers present was noteworthy.
A salute of seventeen guns in honor of
the admiral of the navy marked the open-
Ing of the proceedings at 1 o'clock. The
usual formalities on the opening of the
court were transacted with dispatch.

two of the grand jury men that indict
ments would be found.
The preliminary hearing of Walter Dim

The story In all Its essential features

business man and capitalist of that city,
had met In a cafe of the town and had
'made an attack upon the character of Rev.
Dr. Green, a Methodist preacher of that
city, accusing him of having blackmailed
his parishioners and of having extorted
$700 in one month from the poor members
of his flock. The article further stated
that a diner at a nearby table took of

There ibelng no commission vacancies
In the Eleventh, Steunenberg was made
second lieutenant In the Forty-eighth
United States Volunteer Infantry and aft
erward first lieutenant. He was mus
tered out a short time ago as batallon
adjutant, . ranking as captain, In that
regiment. He was just two years In
working himself up. from a private in a
strange command without friends to 'a
commissioned officer on the colonel's
staff. â¢ . . Â¦Â¦ ,
His friends had not long to. wait. He
was assigned to duty as a private in the
Eleventh Cavalry in the Philippines. In
two years' time, through recommenda
tions of regular army officers, he rose to
be corporal, sergeant and first sergeant.
He received special mention â¢ twice for
bravery, once for swimming a river In
the face of the enemy's fire and once for
standing by a wounded comrade and
holding off an attacking force until he'p
came. - Â¦ .
Now comes the interesting part of the
story. After .leaving the Idaho regiment
Steunenberg enlisted in the regulars from
New York and again went' to the Phil
ippines. His object was to get into a
command where there would be no pol
itics and where he would come under the
authority of regular army ollicers, who
would regard nothing but his "fitness as
a soldier In passing judgment upon him.
Shortly after . enlisting- Steunenberg
wrote to friends In this city telling them
to keep their eyes* on him and they would
see whether he possessed qualifications
other than those of a politician to entitle
him to a commission.
Captain Steunenberg spoke a little too
plainly concerning the courage- of
one of his : superior officers. Pol
itics entering into, the squabble, Captain
Steunenberg, whose brother was at the
time Governor of Idaho, was subjected
to a court-martial and, for awhile, de
prived of his command. He was after
ward reinstated, but soon resigned from
the regiment.
Captain George Steunenberg, who left
yesterday for his home In ICnoxville,
Tenn.. will be remembered by readers of
The Call as one of the officers of the
Idaho regiment who had considerable
trouble at tho time that regiment re
turned from its service in the war with
Spain.

G'.UBA'S "Queen of Beauty,"- Senorita. Silvia Alfonso' y
â¢Aldama, is in town, says the New -York World. She
arrived on the Ward line steamer Morro Castle, from
Havana, and is stopping at the Hotel MarlbOroUgh. .'
She is a young woman of 20 years, as vivacious as a' Parisl
enne and with the rare taste in dress of her French sister.
This may be due to the fact that she was educated in France.
She .speaks Â¦ French as fluentjy, as she does Spanish and her
English is marked with the prettiest kind of an accent.
Senorita Alfonso -has the black hair and the liquid brown
eyes â¢ typical of the Cuban woman. Her complexion is; much
paler than the average Cuban's, forming a fine contrast to her
eyes and hair. . â¢-
She is a clever and witty talker, and regards the distinction
she bears of being the prettiest woman of -Cuba -as -something
of a good natured joke.
"My friends are responsible for it," she said with "a smile.
. Every three or four years a new beauty Is chosen In Havana
by popular vote, the contest being managed by La Figaro, the
Cuban- newspaper. The contest which resulted in the election
of Senoxita Alfonso took place in March last^ She received
16,320 votes. Her- nearest competitor was Senorita, Marguerite
Mendoza,- who received between 10,000 and 11,000 votes.
"Miss Mendbza is far inore deserving of the honor than I
am," said '.the "queen," "and early In the contest had the most
votes, but I have a number of good friends who worked hard
In ray behalf." '
The Senorlta's father, Cristobal Alfonso, is a wealthy mani
although , her grandfather/ Miguel Aldama, sacrificed his
fortune during the Ten Years' ."War.
The teauty was chaperoned by Mr. and Mrs. Villes Pulldo;
a, newly married couple, who are on their honeymoon and ara
en route to Paris. Senora Pulido was Cuba's "Queen oÂ£
Beauty" four years" ago. . .
Senator Taylor is a candidate for re-election, and
probably people who admire his smartness may be
inclined to vote for him in the expectation that he
will at' the next session of the Legislature show fur
ther smartness by introducing a joker in some other
part of our laws that will be equally profitable to
those on the inside. The average voter, however,
is not likely to admire astuteness of that kind, or to
approve of that sort oi statesmanship. No doubt "it
is very clever in the' way of legislative trickery, but
it costs too much for the performance to be attrac
tive to the taxpayer. Inevitably there will be a good
deal of kicking against the new law; and in the kick
ing Senator -Taylor will be fortunate if he, escape get
ting a good portion of it from his constituents.
The full extent of the wrong done to the interior
counties may not yet be fully understood by the
people, but tney will have an understanding of it
brought home to thim before long; .When the next
tax levy is made up in their counties and the Super
visors seek out property to be taxed- to' make up the
deficiency due to the absence of revenues from the
saloons, the moral of the situation will be plain to
all. ' Â¦ ,
heavily as they should be.
The gain to the manipulators of. the scheme may
be passed over as a matter of private business, but
the 4oss to the counties is an affair of public concern.
The revenues hitherto obtained from county licenses
of the saloon traffic must be obtained elsewhere, and
that means a heavier burden upon the taxpayers gen
erally. The saloon business is an unproductive, in
dustry, which adds' nothing to the wealth of the com
munity, so that the shifting removes the burden from
a traffic that could readily have borne it and places
it upon the productive industries of the counties,
which are already taxed for county purposes about as
The Call has thoroughly exposed the effect of the
amendment and also the profitable use to which Sen
ator Taylor put it He and his allies who solicited
the saloon men of the State to employ them < as coun
sel to fight any attempt on the part of Boards of Su
pervisors to impose a revenue tax upon them have
won their game. They did not make as much as they
would have done had not The Call exposed the trick,
but doubtless they made a good deal, for they were
busy in getting contracts from saloon-keepers some
time before the exposure was made. They are there-;,
fore somewhat richer than they were, and the county
treasuries will be in future a good deal poorer.
VALID and sound is the "joker" which Senator
Taylor interjected inio the law authorizing
Boards of Supervisors and the legislative
bodies of incorporated cities and towns to regulate
the liquor business. It is no longer in the authority
of such bodies to issue licenses for purposes of. rev
enue. The decision was given by the Supreme Court
in the case of Henry Pfirrman of-Los Angeles, who
objected to paying' a tax imposed by the county, and
it unqualifiedly affirms the validity of the amend
ment. . â¢ . â¢
THE "JOKER" IS VALID.

"Of that press the San Francisco Examiner, the New York Journal and the Chi

DECLABES FISH AND
GAME LAWS AJLE VALID
Commission Merchants and Market
men Lose Important Suit by
Supreme Court Decision.
The constitutionality of the fish and
game laws passed by the last Legislature
Â¦was practically established by a decision
of the Supreme Court yesterday.
The law, in regard to which there has
' been the greatest amount of contention,
makes it illegal for any one to have more
than fifty doves or wild ducks in his pos
session on any one day. The observance
of the regulation was found to work great
hardship on commission merchants and
marketmen. and it was decided to make
a determined attempt to have tne statute
declared unconstitutionaL
Accordingly, to make a test case, J. P.
Corriea notified the Fish Commission
that he had violated the law. He was ar
rested and after conviction was sentenced
to pay a fine of $25. He appealed and the
Superior Court afflrmed the decision of
the lower court.
Petition was then made to the Supreme
Court for a Â¦writ of habeas corpus on the
ground that the defendant was deprived
of his liberty under a law which was un
constitutional.
Tne Supreme Court denied the petition,
which action is in effect a decision up
holding the constitutionality of the act In
Question.

Boatswain's Mate Accidentally Killed
' Oscar Strandberg, boatswain's mate of
the Government transport Sumner, died in

Frances J. Murphy Le Gonedec filed suit
yesterday against Congressman Victor
Metcalf, executor of the estate of Mary
Margaret Isabella v Murphy, for $5000, the
value of fifty shares of stock of the San
Joaquin Valley Railroad Company.
It is alleged in the complaint that Con
gressman Metcalf disposed of the stock
and failed to make a return to either tb.3
plaintiff or her representatives. The suit
is filed to compel the executor to show
cause why he denied the application made
by the plaintiff for the stock or its equiv
alent in money.' , The complaint states
that the application was received by Met
calf and that he indorsed thereon a re
fusal to comply with the request. The
request was made under an order of the
court before which Mary M. I. Murphy's
will .was probated, calling upon the cred
itors of the estate to present their claims.
James G. Maguire represents Frances J.
M. Le Gonedec.
Superior Judge Seawell rendered a de
cision yesterday which upholds the power
claimed by the Board of Education to flx
the salaries of four Deputy Superintend
ents of Schools, and also decides that the
salaries should be paid out of the school
funds. ; .
The decision was the result of a suit
brought by James Denman.as a taxpayer
to restrain Auditor "Wells from paying the
salary warrant ot T7. D. KJngrsbury, Dep
uty Superintendent of Schools, whose sal
ary was fixed by a resolution adopted by
the Board of education at $150 per month,
.air. ueaman sougtat to stop the payment
"u t 5 e . w^ TTant on the ground that the
board had not the power to fix a Deputy
Superintendent's salary. A synopsis of the
decision follows: ....
B Â« y i **Â£- , ex P res Â» provisions of eectlon 8tf of
wuele XI of the constitution It was compe
tent in the charter to provide for thÂ« number
of deputies that each county officer shall have,
and for tfce compensation payable to each of
the deputies. The Superintendent of Schools is
a county officer and Is required by the charter
to appoint four deputy superintendents. But
the amount of compensation which they shall
receive is not fixed by the charter, neither is
there any express provision in that instrument
authorizing the Board of Education to fix it.
?Â»or Is_the power conferred by section 1 of
chapter V. art. VII of the charter, which re
quires the Board of Education, in its annual
estimate of expenditures necessary for the ad
ministration of the public school system, to
Include the salary of deputy superintendents.
This section merely assumes that the salary
of the deputies has been fixed by competent
authority. Â¦
- The provision of section 1549 of the Political
Code, which reads: "Each County Superin
tendent may appoint a deputy, but no salary
payable out of the school fund must be al
lowed euch deputy." does not apply to the
common-school fund of the charter, though It
Is called by the same name. The payment out
of that fund of the salaries of the deputy
euperintendents does not diminish the amount
appropriated or collected for school purposes.
Auditor 'Wells was represented by Carl
ton W. Greene, former Assistant District
Attorney of Alameda County, who is also
attorney for Superintendent of Schools
Webster.

The veto by Governor Gage of the bill
to create the commission asked I for by
the Water and Forest Association and
many other representative organizations
of the State, to carry on the work of in
vestigating the water and ' forest re
sources of California, caused a suspen
sion of. the Tvork that had been done in
the: field in the direction indicated. For
this reason and pending: another session
of the Legislature the session of the Wa
ter and Forest. Association has been set
aside, but a forestry convention â¢ may be
made to accomplish very good wont, so
say Secretary Friedlander and Â¦ other
prominent members of. the association.
Mr. Friedlander said yesterday that it
has not been' definitely decided whether,
or not the proposed convention : will be
called. There 4s no State forestry reserve
in California and the State has no power
to save for the benefit of its Inhabitants
an indispensable means for prolonging the
water supply of . the mountains - during
the summer months. * The denudation of
the mountainsides of trees and brush per
mits the water to run off speedily and in
calculable harm is accomplished , simply
bv neglect.' New "York State has* seen
the need of protecting the watersheds on
the Adirondacks. -The necessity in Cal
if ornia- for â¢' similar protection Is more
marked than in any Kastern State on ac-.
count of the dry season here. Much good
may be accomplished by a conference of
the people who* are interested in forest
preservation in California. -If the conven
tion is called, Mr. i Friedlander said, ; In
vitations will be sent out to the forestry
associations and to the Sierra Club and
kindred organizations to be .represented
by delegates. â¢; ... --,,
Â¦ The California ."Water and Forest Asso
ciation Â¦- has ' 6000 1 members and Is I adding
to the membership by "keeping represen
tative* at work in | the interest of- the
water and forestry movement. The mill
that was .vetoed by Governor â¢ Gage was
indorsed by' twenty-three'- Chambers of
Commerce, Boards of Trade and similar
organizations,, by a i petition : of .5700 cit
izens from all counties and by the Thirty

A State forestry convention for the
purpose of formulating a programme for
the preservation of the forests, on the
mountainsides of California may take
the place of the annual gathering of the
California' Water and Forest Association
this year. The matter has been discussed
to some extent and there axe strong ad
vocates of" the idea, -

In April, 1S00, an ordinance was passed
imposing a license of 50 cents a quarter on
each telephone instrument. Under this
ordinance the second suit was brought to
recover the sum of $6^0.
It was under these two ordinances that
the two suits against the company were
begun. Tax Collector Scott employed an
attorney to bring the actions, claiming
that he had tho right to do so under an
old ordinance of the city, which gave the
License Collector the right to employ an
attorney to collect the delinquent licenses.
E. S.Pillsbury and Alfred Sutro, attor
neys for the telephone company, filed an
answer setting up a number of defenses,
one of which showed that the license of
$2 a quarter on automatic nickel-in-the
slot machines was never intended to ap
ply to the coin collecting attachments. in
use by the company. The attorneys 'also
showed that the company had for years
paid a regular license on its telephone
business., . .
When the cases were called . for trial
"Wednesday the attorneys for the com-,
pany, pursuant to a notice they had given
to the attorneys for tho city, made a mo
tion that both actions bo dismissed on the
ground that^-the attorneys representing
the city had'no authority to begin the
suits. The Â¦"Â«â¢ matter was fully argued
Wednesday and yesterday. . '
W. I-'.Bi'obeck, attorney for the city, re
plied at length to the points made by the
attorneys for the company. - Franklin K.
Lane, City and County Attorney, also par
ticipated in the argument.
The chief point of discussion turned
upon the question whether or not under
the charter it is necessary for the Mayor
to sign a. resolution of the Board of Su
pervisors as well as i an ordinance. The
company'3 attorneys, contended that
the resolutions authorizing Tax Col
lector Scott 'to bring these suits and in
structing City and County Attorney. Lane
to take charge of them were inoperative
for want of signature by the Mayor. â¢
\ Judge Hebbard, after listening to argu
ment and carefully Â¦ reviewing -the. pro
visions of the charter, sustained this con
tention.- Â¦ : - â¢ - , - Â¦ :Â¦>-, Â¦ . .:â¢ .
It appears that a license of $2 a quarter
was imposed on nlckel-in-the-slot ma
chines by an ordinance passed" by the
board in 1896. The ordinance covered all
such machines, and because it contained
the words "other electric machines" the
Supervisors concluded last year that the
telephone company ought to pay $2 a
quarter on. each of its nickel-in-the-slot
boxes.
Superior Judge Hebbard decided the
matter when he * dismissed two suits
brought by the city against the telephone
company. The suits were brought against
the company in May of last year. One
was for $196,000 for license taxes claimed
to be due from the telephone company on
the coin attachments, or nickel-in-the-slot
machines.
No doubt the passage of some 1S00 reso
lutions since the adoption of the charter
served to amuse the Board of Supervi
sors, but the members of the board were
greatly surprised yesterday to learn that
these resolutions. are not effective unless
signed by the Mayor.

COURT RULES
AGAINST CITY
Oakland should make a hard fight with the
Anjrels. With Moskiman. Schmidt and Hodson
in the box and little Mohler at second they
have a team that is hard to beat.
Nnrdykij dropped rather an easy fly in the
eixth and Hildebrand dropped a foul, something
which seldom happens.
McGucken made the only run and two of the
four hits obtained by his team.
Parke Wilson failed to get his customary hit.
He has hit the ball safely in every game but
two in which he has played.
"â¢Josh" Reilly made the best hit in yester
day's contest It was a long double to center.
Doyle made a phenomenal catch of Pabst' s
long fly in the sixth. In making the catch he
fell, but pluckily held on to the ball. Â§
"Toungey" Johnson did not go south with
the Dudes, as they already have three pitchers.
He appeared on the Wasp6' bench yesterday
adorned with his "glad rags" and looked an-
Iburg worked his slow ball with great effect
on Courtney and Doyle yesterday. He struck
out both of them and also bad McNeely guess
ing.
Devereaux made a great stop of Wilson's
hard drive in the first yesterday and robbed
the German's backstop of a clean hit.
McNeely Is certainly a pitcher of the flrst
water. He has good speed, a fine assortment of
curves and splendid control.

Both teams fielded in a snappy manner,
Reilly. Devereaux and JCordyke making
the only errors. Shay, Devereaux anil
Doyle each accepted some particularly
difficult chances, which if missed wouid
surely" have resulted in runs being scored.
The only run of the game was scored
in Sacramento's half of tho eighth. Mc-
Gucken hit, took second on Me JJeely's
sacrifice and crossed the rubber on Mc-
Laughlin's lucky single to the right gar
den. The next man was an easy out and
the run getting was all over. The locals
came near scoring in their turn, but could
not hit when a hit meant a run. The
score:
Iburg and McNeely officiated on the
slab and both pitched magnificent ball.
They were as well matched as two twirl
ers could be, each allowing four hjts, two
bases on balls and making two strikeouts.
The San Francisco and Sacramento
baseball teams indulged In a battle royal
at Recreation Park yesterday afternoon,
neither team being able to .send "a man
across the plate for seven Innings of snap
py playing. In the eighth the Senators
proved the luckier, bringing McGucken
home by means of two clean singles and a
sacrifice. The DutQh also made two hits
the last time they were up, but were un
able to score.

Sir Albert S was again the star of the
harness brigade In the 2:13 pace he sold
a 20 to 5 favorite over the entire field,
and won with perfect ease in straight
heats, his third heat being covered in
2:09*4. Nothing has been able to extend
the Diablo hoTse. and he looks a promis
ing candidate for the free-for-all class
next year. El Diablo finished second in
each heat paced.
A broken hopple resulted disastrously
for the backers of Our Boy's Sister, which
brought 10 against 1 for the field in what
betting was indulged in on the special
pace. With Charles Bunch behind her. the
chestnut mare took the first heat without
apparent effort About three furlongs
from home in the heat following one of
the hopples broke and she was distanced.
This left Richard B and Penrose to fight
It out, the first named horse securing the
long end of the purse in an uninteresting
struggle.
Matters did not open auspiciously for
favorites in the running events. Galan*
thus, 7 to 10 choice for the seven and a
half furlong affair, stumbled soon after
the start. Tuliett clung to the horse's
reck for fifty yards before he was rolled
in the dust. He escaped injury. Rinaldo
led to the stretch, where he was pa&sed
by Canejo. Foucon landing the mare a
handy winner at odds of 6 to L , Limber
Jim fan a poor fourth.
Ed Lanlgan'3 Hainault. carrying 110
pounds and ridden by Hoar, took the two
year-old handicap, at five furlongs. Hoar
beat the others away and, never headed,
wen by four open lengths In 1:01. Away
none too well. Jarretierre d'Or, the favor
ite, lost the place to Lapidus by a head.
Only six started.
Quite a strong tip permeated the ring
on Rey Dare to take the seventh event.
Backed to 3 to 2. the big fellow stepped
off three-quarters In 1:13^4, leading from
the jump. Foucon on Sir Dougal came
from the rear, downing Good Hope for
the place.
A cheap bunch started in the concluding
seven and a half furlong tour. Burlln
game astride Oalene, an 8 to 1 shot, led
his company away from the barrier, sim
ply epread-eagling the bunch. Casdale,
the favorite, just got the place by a head
from Kastaine.
Summary of the Races.
Sir Albert S Wins Handily.
SACRAMENTO. Sept.
day attracted another vast throng to Ag
ricultural Park, the rating card being the
longest of the season. Kigbt harness and
running events were decided. His Excel
lency Governor Gage viewed several of
the finishes froai the judges' stand, being
the guest of honor. While but three fa
vorites carried eff laurels the smart ones
landed on sevcr.il of the winners, and the
books did not enjoy as profitable a day
as they otherwise might.
Because of an uneven adjustment of the
weights the Governor's stake, at one mile
and a furlong, worth $G90. did not furnish
much of a contest. Vesuvian, the 4 to 5
choice, with Ruiz and US pounds up. was
let in altogether too light. After Flush of
Gold and Sir Hampton had set a clinking
pace to the stretch Ruiz made his move.
Scotch Plaid responded gamely, but Vesu
vian had too much class, winning at leis
ure by a length In 1:53%. nearly track
record time. Flush of Gold, anchored
with 113 pounds, was out of it at. the end.
There were but four starters.
Only four fillies sported colors for
the Sunny Slope stakes, valued at $520. Ab
Stemler's Dlviaa was held a prohibitive
1 to 3 choice, with Ruiz up. Slow to leave
the barrier, the best she could do was to
finish third. Logue on Sister Jeanie went
away at a merry clip, only to be nailed a
nose on the wire by Doreen. the Burns &
Waterhouse entry- The latter filly, splen
didly ridden by Ransch. covered the nve
furlongs in 1:00 3-5. Like all the returning
Montana campaigners, Inocencia cut no
figure.
NAVAL MILITIA
TO TAKE CRUISE
The annulment was not granted, but the
couple have continued living apart, and
the affairs of the Shaughnessys were for
g'Otten until the action for divorce was
instituted by the lonely husband.
Shaughnessy and his wife are first
cousins. At the time of the marriage con
siderable comment Â¦ was caused by the
news of the relationship getting out. He
is a boiler-maker by trade. The fact that
Miss Nunan was willing to leave a lux
uriously furnished home for "that of a
mechanic caused a great amount of talk,
which was not stilled until those who
knew them tired of their marriage as a
theme for gossip.
Mrs. Shaughnessy was not summoned,
but a visit was paid to her in Sonoma,
where her deposition was taken. Under
oath she stated that she had been plied
with liquor at the home of Mrs. Little,
her husband's mother, and kept in a state
of intoxication until the ceremony had
been performed. She said that when she
regained her senses she left her husband
and had no desire to go back to him.
He claimed that Anastasia was not the
real plaintiff, and that she was coerced
into and compelled to commence the ac
tion by her brother, Frank Nunan, J. J.
Harrigan and Lawrence Hourihan. The
last named, Shaughnessy claimed, was a
rejected suitor for the fair Anastasla's
hand and was actuated by jealousy.
. Shaughnessy and his wife have never
been reunited, and the husband gave up
the battle yesterday.
A short time after the wedding Mrs.
Shaughnessy asked that the marriage
ceremony be annulled, claiming that she
wedded Shaughnessy under "force, fraud
and duress." She said the ceremony was
performed while sha was in a state of
mental Irresponsibility, superinduced by
liquors and narcotics.
Her husband denied the charges and
said that when his wife married him she
was fully in possession of her faculties.
He wanted- her summoned so that the
court could see what a bright woman she
was.
AUGUSTUS SHAUGHNESSY was
granted a divorce from Anastasia
Shaughnessy yesterday by Judge
Graham. The decree was granted
. on the ground of desertion, and is
the ending of a marriage celebrated but a
little more than a year ago that attracted
widespread attention.
Mrs. Shaughnessy that was Is tne
daughter of Matthew. Nunan, -the million
aire brewer, and she wedded the man who
has secured a divorce from her April 6,
1900, under' such peculiar circumstances
that, so the story goes, her father had
her stolen away from the side of her hus
band a few days after the ceremony. The
alleged abduction of the young wife
brought the couple into the courts.
Shaughnessy said his wife would return
to him if she was free from her father's
control. He filed a complaint and asked
for a writ of habeas corpus to secure the
custody of his stolen bride.
The bride"s father made return to the
writ and denied that his daughter was re
strained of her liberty. He stated that
she was in Sonoma County, where she
went of her own free will.

Champion Jeffries and
Joe Kennedy Will
Box There.
The Labor Unions Find No
Flaw in the Latter's
In an effort to help his many friends
in the Reliance Athletic Club, Oakland.
Champion "Jim" Jeffries stirred up op
position' which appeared for a time to
menace all the boxing engagements for
which his representative, "Kid" Egan,
has booked" him on this coast. .
It all came about through his agree
ment to' meet big Joe Kennedy In a spe
cial four-round bout before his fight with
Ruhlin. Owing to Billy Delaney, his
manager, living in Oakland he has pre
pared for all his big fights there, and has
always had the use of the Reliance Club
gymnasium. In return for the courtesies
shown him he has on several occasions
volunteered . his services on exhibition
nights. Following out this custom he
offered to box four rounds with any one
the club officials might select. They ac
cepted and named Joe Kennedy. ;
Jeffries thought the matter was all set
tled until rumors reached him that the
laboring element Intended boycotting his
fight with Ruhlin in this city and his ex
hibitions throughout the State. Inquiry
developed the fact that Kennedy was ac
cused of being a non-union man. Any one
knowing him would not believe such a
statement . for a moment, and tt did not
take him long to clear himself of the
charge. The Reliance Club officials re
ferred the matter to the Teamsters'
Union, and its officers gave Kennedy a
clean bill of health.
Walter B. Fawcett, manager of the
club, has the necessary articles prepared.
All that Is required to clinch the matter
is the signature of Kennedy. Jeffries, to
win, must stop Kennedy in four rounds.
As the latter is a shlfty^boxer the task
allotted the champion is not a light one.
The directors of the Olympic Club have
arranged six special boxing bouts for next
Wednesday evening. Their efforts to find
an opponent for "Jimmy" Britt proved
fruitless. The latter offered to give away
ten pounds in weight, but all the avail
able talent declined to accept the in
evitable thrashing at his hands. The men
who will box are:
Ed Parker and William Hagerty, 118
pounds; W. J. Leonard and Daniel Dan
ziger, 125 pounds; J.'F. McCarthy and Dan
Barry, 140 pounds; Joseph Lundie and

STRIKE AFFAIRS
IN BAD SHAPE
Ifa giving reasons. for the strike being broken
a leading lumberman has been quoted as say
ing that the Building, Trades Council did not
vrish to have business entirely stopped here
which, would have been done had thÂ» long-
The Building Trades Council of Ala
meda County has accepted publicly the
responsibility for the break in the strike
on this side of the bay. A detailed ex
planation of the council's attitude con
cerning the strike of the teamsters and
the longshoremen in sympathy with the
San Francisco walkout has been made by
J. H. Mullen, chairman of the executive
committee of the Alameda County Build
ing Trades Council. Chairman Mullen de
clares that the council, which represents
thousands of union mechanics, at no time
favored the strike in Oakland, but urged
the longshoremen against quitting, and
declared that they had by right no place
in the warfare that was waging in San
Francisco. . , .
In his public statement of the case
Chairman Mullen said:
Whether the Teamsters'- Union 1 will re
fuse to handle lumber, discharged by the
returned longshoremen is a question. The
union drivers have been handling coal
which non-union crews discharged, and
the employers do not believe that the
lumber teamsters will be interfered with
by the union,, although the matter is un
der advisement. . . -.
Ali of the cargo handlers necessary to
move lumber and coal are at hand, and

difficulty in prospect so far as the move
ment of those commodities is concerned.
The decision of the longshoremen to re
sume .work will give the tied-up lumber
vessels in San Francisco Bay opportunity
to be discharged, the cargoes being tran
shipped from Oakland to the San Fran
cisco yards. Lumber men are confident
that the action of the Oakland longshore
men is the beginning of the end.
Captain Wikander of the schooner
Muriel, which is being discharged at the
Puget Sound Lumber Companyis dock,
was given a police guard to-day because
a dozen sailors from San . Francisco
boarded . the schooner yesterday and
forced some longshoremen off- the vessel.
A crowd of strikers made its appearance
to-day, but the members were kept away
from the schooner.
OAKLAND, Sept. 12.â Efforts of strikers
from San Francisco to induce the union
longshoremen to again quit work have
failed. Delegations from across the bay
made two attempts to confer with men
on the water front to-day, but there was
no meeting, the longshoremen declaring
they were well content to return to work
and desired no interference. . â¢
Longshoremen iDecline . to Confer
With San Francisco Committee.
REFUSE TO QUIT WORK AGAIN
Hence when Mr. Nellson,.the business agent
of the longshoremen, says that the Building
Trades Council has done nothing: for them,
he evidently draws on his imagination, for
he must admit that the .. Building Trades
Council at least gave advice to the longshore
men, its advice to go to work land not embroil
itself in a question between two bodies of
neither of which were the longshoremen an
integral partâ a piece ,of advice which, had the
longshoremen acted on, they would not now
find themselves in what must be a somewhat
embarrassing position of voluntarily .electing
to do something- ; that, a . short time - ago, they
voluntarily elected not to do.
Said action was taken* by the executive com
mittee and was Indorsed .< by the Building
Trades Council as a protective measure not
only to the longshoremen ~ themselves, but in
the Interests of the several other crafts who
are affiliated with them .and who, by reason
of that affiliation, are as,, vitally interested in
any demand that is made, by any union as is
the union which makes the demand; and, also,
to protect the employers whose interests the
Building Trades Council realizes must be con
sidered paramount to all others.- â¢
This was taken after the fact - was
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the execu
tive committee that the work in question had
heretofore been done by the longshoremen and
was claimed and allowed "by the trades rules
and by-laws of the Longshore Lumbermen's
Union, as they at that time existed.
shoremen's strike continued longer. For the
benefit of the public I will say it is not now,
nor has It ever been the policy of the Build
ing Trades Council to' tolerate any Interference
from any organization not affiliated with and
subordinate to the Building Trades Council
that would tend to mar the harmony that at
present exists, and for a longr time has existed,
between the employers and employes in the
various departments of the building Industry.
In explaining the action taken by the Build-
Ing Trades Council In what is at present re
ferred to as the longshoremen's strike, . I will
say that the executive committee of the Build
ing Trades Council, in a. special meeting called
to consider the question, recommended to the
longshoremen that they handle all lumber
coming to Oakland as usual.
One of the principal grounds on which
the professor will base his request for
the removal of his subordinate is that she
Is of a quarrelsome nature and prone to
imagine that the pupils are her designing
enemies and that the other teachers are
attempting to interfere with her work.
The charges are all signed by Professor
Lyser and in his complaint he asserts that
other instructors will be secured to sub
stantiate his allegations.
The charges which Professor Lyser will
present to the board aver that Miss Mc-
Kinney is unable to maintain order in her
class-room except by excitine: fear in the
pupils; that her methods of instructing
are bad, in that she does- not develop the
pupils' power to think for themselves, and
that they are merely led to imitate with
out any comprehension of the meaning or<
purpose of education. Professor Lyser
also claims that Miss McKinney's. lan
gruage is too often not in line with the
comprehension of small children and that
she too frequently assigns more work
than the children could properly assimi
late.
A complaint is to be presented to the
Board of Education to-day alleging that
Miss M. C. McKinney, teacher of the
second grade of the John Swett Grammar
School, is incapable, because of certain
mental peculiarities, of properly filling her
position. The charges have been drawn
up by Professor Albert Lyser, principal of
the school.
To most of the teachers In the public
schools, the charges against Miss McKin
ney will cause great surprise. She has
held a position as an instructor since
January 28. 1S2L Since her appointment in
1S91 she has taught in at least nine dif
ferent schools in various parts of the
city, and this is the first time, as far as
is known, that her ability as a teacher
has been called Into question. When she
first entered into the service of the School
Department, she was assigned to a posi
tion in the Noe Valley School. Since then
at different times she has taught in the
James Lick. Starr King, Hearst. Rich
mond. Buena Vista, South End, Irving
Scott and Cleveland Grammar schools.

brutally beaten by five, strikers. Shaul
has been employed for a number of years
by John Rosenfeld's Sons. He has never
belonged to any union, and when the
strike was declared remained with his
employers.
He left his home about 6:45 o'clock yes
terday morning and was attacked as he
alighted from a car at Steuart and How
ard streets. Shaul is an elderly man, un
dersized and frail. His assailants first
knocked him down and -then kicked him
repeatedly. They allowed him to, rise and
walk away a few yards, only to knock
him down again. When they finally got
through with him he got up and was as
sisted to his home. It will be some timo
before he will be able to work again.

STRIKERS ATT!A<ZK AGED MAN.
While Casey and Furuseth- were renew
ing their strength at the Palace Hotel
crowds of hard-handed, sunburned toilers
of the sea and wharf were waiting
around the of Â¦ the City
Front Federation seeking news of their
cause. It was an anxious crewd. The
feeding of hungry mouths at home is be
coming a greater problem every day. A
headquarters for the relief of suffering
strikers has been ' established on Eddy
street and organized bands of solicitors
are . scouring the city for. the sinews of
war. .
Both Casey and Furuseth denied later
in the day that the luncheon at the Pal
ace Grill was a strike function. Each of
them denied any knowledge of the visits
paid to Michael's office immediately after
luncheon by the man who* lunched with
them. They- even asserted that strike
matters were not discussed while they
were tickling their palates with the dishes
that gourmets feast upon nor yet as they
lingered over black coffee and cigars.
The strike leaders entered the exclusive
atmosphere of the "grill" ripe with the
experience of recent banqueting. Ed Ros
enberg, secretary of the Labor Council,
last Saturday gave a banquet at which
Casey and Furuseth were- honored guests,
and the day following Jefferson D. Pierce,
national organizer, was host at another
banquet where those high in the councils
of the labor world were "among those
present."
The first visit to the Mills building office
was made shortly after 1 o'clock, . imme
diately after the Examiner's business
manager had lunched at the Palace Grill
with Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the
Sailors' Union and chairman of the exec
utive committee of: the City Front Fed
eration, and Michael Casey, president of
the City Front Federation and business
agent of the Brotherhood of Teamsters.
The Examiner representative said he had
come to suggest a conference â¢ on the
strike. Â£Ie was willing and ready to act
for the strikers and by conference with
him the employers would escape the ne
cessity of direct conference with the strike
leaders. Mr. Michael was greatly aston
ished by the visit and by the suggestion
that the employers would find it more
agreeable to treat with a representative
of the Examiner than with the men who
are the accredited representatives of la
bor. He promptly told his visitor there
was nothing the Examiner could do xo
end the strike except to tell its readers
the plain truth about the strike situation,
inform the strikers that they had lost and
advise them to go to their former eni
ployers and seek work under the old con
ditions.
The Examiner representative returned
before 2 o'clock and renewed his entreaty,
urging that a Blight concession In the
way of recognition of the unions would
bring the strike to an end, and that this
recognition could be extended through
him and no meeting whatever with the
strike leaders need be held. His dismissal
was even more curt than before, and he
lef I in a white heat of rage.
strike, made an attempt yesterday
to negotiate a settlement on the basis of
some slight concession which would en
able it to claim the credit of having won
a victory for the strikers. -The business
manager of that journal called twice
within an hour at the office' of M. F.
Michael, attorney for the. Employers' As
sociation, with a proposition that they en
ter into a conference to see if settlement
might not be reached. He was dismissed
so curtly that he departed the second
time in a towering rage, vowing venge
ance upon the men who had refused to
grant the representative of their traducer
an audience.
THE Examiner, beginning to feel
the weight of responsibility *for the
prolongation of the deplorable con
ditions brought about by the
"I've got to go to work or let my fam
ily starve!" said another.
Â¦ According to the" story of some who
were present the teamsters, while not in
open rebellion against Casey's authority,
nevertheless resolved among themselves
to return to work without loss of time.
In other words, they were determined to
make a break in the interest first of their
families, already too long neglected, and
secondly in the interest of peace between
â¢the warring factions.
"We're tired .* of this strike," said a
teamster after the meeting. "While we
are getting poorer for the sake of princi
ple our leaders are eating swell dinners
at leading hotels. . The wishes of the ma
jority, of the Teamsters' Union were not
consulted, by the leaders when the strike
was declared. I have a wife and children
dependent upon me for support, and in the
past few weeks the-grass has been get
ting very short. The time has come for
decisive action on the part of the striking
teamsters, and, I think two-thirds of the
men are more than- anxious to return to
work. Before the end of the week I be-
lieve hundreds of teamsters will have re
turned to their. places."
Business Agent Michael j Casey of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters denied posi
tively last night that any teamsters pro
posed to return to work to-day. He ad
mitted that a meeting of teamsters was
held on Bush street, but the reported
break, he insisted, did not take place.
"I talked to the men," he said, "and
they soon realized that everything was
going along all right. The teamsters
realized that the facts had been distorted
for their benefit and they are now
stancher than ever. Every union team
ster'Stands firm for union principles and
there will be no wavering in the ranks."
On the other hand the draymen are con
fident? that the' end of the Teamsters'
strike is at hand. The first report re
ceived by the Draymen's Association was
that 300 teamsters had resolved to resign
from the brotherhood and return to work
immediately. Investigation showed that
this was erroneous and that the number
will not exceed seventy-five. That these
men will go to work is stated with posi
tiveness by leading draymen.

took effect.
Frennett was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, but after his injuries had been
attended to he reported for work.
In order to protect himself and his
charge from a volley of stones which
were being hurled by a couple of strik
ers, Harry West, a special officer, was
forced to use his revolver yesterday after
noon. The driver whom Officer West was
guarding is in the employ of . the Over
land Freight Transfer Company. He was
ariving his truck along Harrison street,
near Third, when two men came out of
an alley and commenced to throw stones
at him and the special officer. The latter
fired two shots at the men, who immedi
ately fled. â¢ . \
Joseph O'Brien, a union teamster, was
attacked at 2 o'clock yesterday morning
at Third and Bryant streets and badly

received numerous abrasions and contu
sions of the face and head.

The statement in certain quarters that
many of the recent assaults ! upon and
robbery of non-union men were commit
ted by union teamsters was indignantly
denied by a speaker. It was decided to
request the newspapers to publish an of
ficial denial of the damaging report.
It Â¦was reported by Secretary McLaugh

had sent its assurance that ample funds
would be provided in- aid of the team-
Bters in their fight for a period of six

Resolved, That we uphold our own union,

Resolved, That we stand by the principle of

Resolved, By the Brotherhood of Teamsters,
In regular weekly meeting assembled, that we
declare that in the present conflict the labor
unions have right on their side and deserve

The report that some fifty teamsters
had resolved during the day to return to
work waÂ» brought up and denied by
Michael Casey and Andrew Furuseth,
both of whom addressed the meeting at
some length. When the enthusiasm of
a majority of those present was at its
height a motion was made and carried to
appoint a committee of three to draft res
olutions expressing the confidence of the
brotherhood in the strike leaders and call
ing upon loyal members to remain true
to union principles. The committee on
being appointed retired and in due time
presented the following resolutions, which
were adopted amid deafening clamor:
The sentiment was vehemently express
ed that no member of the Draymen's As
sociation should be allowed the privilege
cf the floor under any pretext whatsoever,
and Mr. Jacobs' request to be allowed to
speak was accordingly denied. Later Mr.
Jacobs was informed that the executive
committee would not meet, whereupon he
departed in no amiable frame of mind.
M"o Hearing 1 for Draymen.
During the progress of the meeting it
developed that Nathan Jacobs, vice presi
dent of the Draymen's Association, was
desirous of addressing the brotherhood or
executive committee with the avowed pur
pose of making a proposition calculated,
if accepted, to restore peace and harmony
and virtually end the strike.
According to the report of the commit
tee, which was received with vociferous
manifestations of approval, the petition
was destroyed during the afternoon by
the signers, who, realizing that its recep
tion would precipitate a storm that must
surely engulf it, preferred to wait for
a more propitious occasion. The incident
excited considerable debate, which, ac
cording to report, was not entirely one
sided.
The disposition of a percentage of the
membership of the brotherhood to return
to work was manifested by the presenta
tion oi" a petition to the grievance com
mittee, signed by eight men, to be allowed
to drive teams. In the case of Teamster
McN'amara, who ran over a child a feu
days ago and who was obliged to appear
in court, a permit was granted to a sub
stitute union teamster to drive. This ac
tion was made the basis for the prepara
tion and presentation of a, petition for
similar privileges, and it was filed with
the proper committee witn a view to as
certaining the sentiment of that body in
the premises.
p>yiÂ«q HE meeting of the Brotherhood of
H Teamsters held at Turk-stre-H
1 1 Temple last night was one of the
1L most exciting in the history of that
organization. More than 200 team
sters were in attendance.
... Numerous caucuses of teamsters were held at street corners in the wholesale district yesterday afternoon and many of the strikers agreed to go back to work regard
less of the dictum of the Brotherhood. Some of them say the break in the ranks will occur this morning, and that probably, a hundred of them will apply this morning to their for
mer employers for .work. The union took a strong stand in favor of holding out, and the discontented ones may be deterred for the present from the contemplated break, but lead
ing draymen say they will have many union teamsters at work not later than Monday. â¢" - ' Â¦

NEW YORK. Sept. 12.â The news from Buf
falo was practically eliminated as an influence
from the stock market to-day for the first time
eince the event of last Friday. The coming
bank statement began to loom big on the
horizon, as to-morrow's preliminary figures of
the week's cash movements will allow some
estimate of what the showing will be. In the
item of loans, however, the statement itself
on Saturday will have' to be awaited. Appar
ently there can be no escape -from a weak
statement on both scores. The banks have
loot cash on the interior movement during the'
Â¦week, but the drain to the sub-treasury has
been sensibly diminished. Large payments
have been made to the banks on account of
the Australian and Klondike gold and the di
version of internal revenue receipts Into bank
deposits is apparently beginning to affect the
account with the Government institutions. â¢ The
increase in Government ceposlts from this
source is to be distributed ultimately among
banks throughout the country that have bonds
with . the Treasury to secure them. But the
bulk, of the payments to the Government are
made In New York and consequently they will
be deposited temporarily in New York banks
having what are called "live accounts" with
the Government and so may. affect the show
ing of the banks this week. The acceptances
by the Secretary of the Treasury of tenders of
Government bonds, were not known until after
the marltet. closed to-day and the payments for
these bonds are too late to figure in this week's
bank statement anyhow Yesterday's 'feeling
of '.skepticism of the efficacy Â©f this measure
to give relief to the money market as would
benefit speculation in stocks was deepened to
day and the additional sharp risÂ« in the "bid
prices of Government bonds on call Increased
the doubt as to tenders being made at prices
which the Secretary â¢ would be inclined to ac
cept in any large amount. The expressed un
willingness of the Secretary to offer any con
eiderable bonus to owners of bonds to induce
them to sell influenced thl6 feeling, which was
a considvable factor in the heaviness and un
certainty which pervaded the market all day
The St- Paul dividend 'episode was disconcert
ing to a part of the speculators who had made
very confident predictions of an Increase in the
dividend and had bought stocks on the etreneth
of tfcelr belief. sul

There have recently been large purchases of
Dried Grapes at Fresno at 3%c per lb in the

-Then it dawned upon Trustee Murrav

the applications of either Pendleton or
Hardy received favorable consideration
so, he called a caucus of himself, Trustees
Niles Searls Jr. and George E. Evans

is required for the equfpment of the pub

has decided that his $50,000 donation .which
was used to construct the edifice is the
limit of his generosity so far as this city
is concerned. His reply denying the re
quest for further contribution has been
received. _

with painful detail the unfortunate story
of Oakland's financial distress, and the
resultant inability- of the people to have
the benefit of the beautiful home for the
public library which had been erected.
Ihe first communication upon the sub
ject was- mailed by Trustee Pendleton,
after the City Council; had refused to give
its sanction to the Trustee's request for
assurance that at least 'JIO.OOO would be

SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 12.â The little town
of Soquel is making, rapid strides in the
way of reform, and will soon have a regâ
ularly organized reform burial society.
Three petitions' are out and already about
150 residents have signed for membership
in tile proposed organization. The society
wlil be known as the Soquel Burial So
ciety, and its purpose is for the making
and furnishing of cofnn3 within the means
of all. The coffins are to be strong and
well finished and of sizes to suit the old
and young.
The undertaker- will be a member of the
society, who will make coffins at only a
price scarcely above the cost of material.
On the petition the signers agree to stand
by each other 'n carrying out a system of
cheap burial for their dead, and each
member is at liberty to have the funerals
conducted by whatever creed, order or
church he or, she may prefer. Each mem
iber will aid and assist as far as possible
at all funerals of the' sdciety. J. W. Dot
son, who has been prominently identilied
with ' such a society in the East, is the
originatorr Thomas Bollfing is to be the
undertaker, and has already rented a va
cant store, which will be fitted up as the
society undertaking- parlors. â¢ _
C. S. Kirkpatrick is to be the sexton at
the Soquel cemetery for the society, and
will dig graves for a fixed price according
to size. It is not the intention to use a
hearse, but the undertaker will provide a
rieat wagon. It is" expeeted that the limit
<5f cost for a funeral will be about $20. A
meeting will sodn.be held for organization
and a. constitution and by-laws are to be
adopted and officers elected.
The signers are from the vicinity of So
quel and Capitola, and Include nearly
every adult person. Among the many who
have signed are the Rev. G>. H. Wilbur,
pastor of the Congregational Church: the
Rev. William Tremayne, a retired Con
gregational clergyman; the Rev. Mr. Kail,
pa-stor of the Methodist Church; Dr. A. F.

every business man.
SEEK TO CLOSE AFFAIRS
OF AN INSOLVENT BANE
California National Stockholders
V Petition. Court Not to Make
Award to Thomas Estate.
M. R. Morgan, "W. K. Vanderslice & Co.
and others filed a bill in equity yesterday
in the United States District Court against
the California National Bank of San Frart
cisco and representatives of the estate of
R. P. Thomas, deceased.
The hank became insolvent on Decem
ber 15, 1888,- and the consequent litigation
was partly ended two weeks ago. when
the report of T. K. Stateler, referee, was
accepted and; awards made to the credi
tors of the insolvent corporation. The bill
recites that $12,000 remains for distribu
tion among the creditors. The complain
ants pray that thi3 sum be distributed
pro rata among the stockholders, except
that the estate of R. P. Thomas, deceased,
be excepted for the reason that the es
tate is delinquent in the sum of $15,334,
and therefore not entitled to participate
in the distribution.
PAST PUPILS PREPARE
TO APPEAR I2T OPERA
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Sept. 12.
Because the Pacific Coast Lumber and
Mill Company has refused to unionize It3
planing mills the union hands there em
ployed were to-day called out by D. A.
Shannon, business agent of the Building
Trades Council, which claims that A.
Kendall, the mill owner, has failed to ad
here 1 to the agreement entered into six
months ago as a compromise of the mill
men's strike. On the other hand, Kendall,
after admitting: his refusal to unionize the
mill by September 1, claims the Mill Ope
ratives' Union has net kept their part of
the agreement. Other mill owners declare
that Kendall Is the only employer who
has not lived up to the agreement.
Kendall Desires Bond.
Kendall has made a statement of his
position, asserting that the Building
Trades Council has not kept to that
clause of the arbitration agreement which
provided that the members of the affil
iated unions should absolutely refasa to
handle any materials coming 1 from any
mill working contrary to the prescribed
number of hours mentioned in the agree
ment or employing other than union me
chanics. Â¦Â¦-.â¢* ---..*
Continuing, Kendall says:
The Buildins Trades Council has repeatedly
violated the section whereby they fc agreed not
to handle material made by a mill working
more than the agreed number of hours, the
secretary of the Millmen's Association having
served notice on them of twenty-seven distinct
violations of that agreement.
Now it is an axiom in taw that a contract
not- bindlnc on one party thereto cannot be
binding on the other, so that I consider myself,
free to unionize my mill or not.
Further than all this, my men, that Is the
union "men I had in my employ, have been
called oft without any six months' allowance.
I have repeatedly offered to unionize my mill
if they would give me a bond of. J10.C0O as sure
ty that they would live up to the articles of
agreement. - Â¦ . . â¢ .
The Building Trades Council therefore stands
In a position of having made agreements which
they will not live up to, yet they want me to
obey. I do not see my way dear to compete
with ten-hour mills while I work eight hours
and obey the many other labor union dictates.
To do so means bankruptcy.
Agent Shannon Replies.
Business Agent Shannon of the Build
ing Trades Council, in an informal reply
to Kendall, said:
Of the list of twenty-seven jobs farnlshet^by
the Mill Owners' Association a majority of
them were "unfair" from beginning: to end,
both with respect to labor and to materials.
On such jobs the council had neither control oC
the work nor of the men employed. My prede
cessor, Mr. Miller, stopped worK <m six jobs
which were being: supplied with unfair mill
work.
President Smith' of the Millmen'3 Union
said: . >
The action taken against Kendall's mill was
simply because of his refusal to unionize the
mill. As far as our present information goes
hl3 mill is the only, one on either side of the
bay which has refused- to comply wltn the
agreement. There may be others, but we have
not yet discovered them. There is nothing to
arbitrate . with Mr. Kendall. He has broken
the agreement by refusing to unionize and
eonsequejitly his men were called off. We
even save- him twelve days* grace, but still
he refused. That is all there is to it. In San
Francisco there haa not been the slightest
trouble and all the mills are working right
along.
A dozen union ' men - left the mill this
morning, leaving", Kendall claims, eight
een non-union men still at work.

Builders' Contracts.
Mrs. Hull reluctantly told the story of
how Hull- proposed to her in Arizona. It
happened while they were riding_across
the desert from. Chaparral to Jerome. She
refused to consent at first, saying that
she had had too many husbands already.
But after a half hour of persuasion she
changed Â¦ her . mind and agreed to Hull's
entreaties.
"Why did you change your mind?" ask
ed the former husband's attorney.
"That's a woman's privilege," suggested
Judge HalL
"Because I loved him," was Mrs. Hull's
reply. ,
' "Did you marry him to get rid of him?"
was asked. '
"No,. but he. kept looking at me and I
had to consent.". ,
'That's a man's privilege,"... suggested
the court again. â¢ . ...
. Mrs. Hull â¢ spent almost the entire day
on the stand, testifying as to the various
bickerings between herself and husband.
She was tearful at times and court had
to be adjourned until these fits were over.
The Hull case turn3 up strange things
in the lives of the couple who are con.
tei'dlng for the possession of $10,000 In
Judge Hall's court. Mrs. Margaret ' J.
Hull, the Â¦ defendant, exhibited an old
brass key while- on the witness stand to
day, which she said" had so far charmed
away ajl ill-luck. "It was given to her by
Hull just after he had proposed to h*r
on an Arizona stagecoach four years ago,
she said. During- one of their, squabbles
later she told/ him "that as long as she
held that key ha would never get the
best of her in any lawsuit. The charm
has been successful to date.-- Hull secured
an annulment of his marriage in Arizona
last year, but. he was ordered to pay his
wife $150 alimony. She defeated him in a
suit in Rhode Island, whither be went to
avoid her, and she secured his arrest there
on tba charge that he was. a fugitive from
justice, In order, to hold him. She was
successful in a race against him 'from
Arizona, when .the $10,000 at issue in the
present sMt was the stake. She made
the boast to-day that she would win the
suit being tried. â¢ t Â¦Â¦ . â¢

tective Tcm Gibson, Detective ' Crockett.
Detective Silvey and Morse's Agency.
The Pinkerton Detective Agency declines
to accept any reward other than the
payment for its services.
Applicants for portions of the $25,000 re
ward were as thick as leaves in autumn
and the Selby Company saw the prospect
of lawsuits and- injunctions looming up.
For a time it seemed as if the reward
money would be tied up in the courts,
eventually to be divided among: lawyers.
The last act of the drama, however, la
now In eight and all will end happily.
President A. J. Kalston of ' the Selby
Company, aided by Attorney E. F. Pres
ton, ha* In the last few days considered
the many claims. Each one has been
carefully weighed and a number of set
tlements have already been made, the
amounts paid being regarded as . confi
dential by all parties.
-President Raleton said last evening:
"I am glad to say that we are settling
the claims to the reward and. some have
already been- paid. The work is a very
delicate one and we will not make public
the various amounts of settlement. Most
unjust statements have been made that
wÂ» would not pay the reward, we offered
at the time of the bullion robbery. These
statements were unwarranted and should
not have been made of a firm that hao
earned the reputation we have In our
forty years of existence. We are not lim
iting our pavments to the $25,000 reward
offered. We desire to do justice to every
one who helped to recover the bullion and
arrest the thief. I cannot state how
much' we will pay to the claimants, but
il will exceed the original sum we offered.
While some of the claimants did better
work than others. It is due to all of them
to state that their combined work result
ed successfully. Each claimant under-
Ftar.cls that his settlement is to be deemed
confidential, as we do not desire to stir
up any ill-feeling among the others, who
might think they have been underpaid if
the amounts were made public."
After the arrest ana conviction of Jack
"Winters and the recovery of the 1 stolen
bullion the Selby Company had a dif
ficult problem to face. â¢
' The dispute "'over the renrard*ofÂ£)ered'by
the Selby Smelting Company for the ar
rest of the thief who looted the vault of
the Bmeller at "Vallejo Junction and tne
recovery of ] the treasure .no longer ex
ists.
The statements Â«that the Selby . Company
would not pay the $25,000 : reward have
absolutely no foundation. As a matter
of fact, the company will pay out more
than the amount offered, as' tt desires to
deal fairly and justly with, the
persons who have made claims. '

ations gathered in this city to-day.' The
disastrous consequences 'of 'the. "labor

of the'product of the ; farms â¢' in "almost
every section,, furnished '.the- theme for
consideration. . Â¦'â¢â¢â¢â¢ ; ' . '
\ Leaders of organized labor were bitterly
arraigned- fOr.whaf was ' charged , to : be
their indifference to the best "interests of
the State,, and resolutions demanding im
mediate cessation of the trouble were
given hearty approval. In these resolu
tions . the ' desire is expressed ,' that â¢expla-'
nations be furnished as to the reason why
the strike should continue to injure the
farmer, and it is even threatened that in
the event of. the State declining to . inter
fere armed grain men' will see to the; ship
ping of cargoes from Port Costa. Oh .the
part ; *of some of the delegates there: was a
disposition- to adopt radical -measures im
mediately, but action of a
character was finally decided upon.V- .< ?
The meeting was held in the courthouse.'
A rollcall of the counties particularly in

should rot the farmer demand the same
thing. The farmer has -been-, the butt- of

reaches a- point that ho cannot continue.-

The convention, was called to order at
the appointed hour by Â¦Â¦ Will ;'S." Green,

Another important step in the organiz

by a- resolution proposed by Mr. Craig of
Yolo County, .calling for. a meeting of all
grain . growers in their respective coun
ties to form a. State convention, wherein
the : industry would be represented by a
delegate representing each ten farmers in
the -various grain-growing counties. -The
plan is to have as many as possible meet
on- Saturday, 'September 21. and! elect

After a discussion of the situation in

offered: resolutions demanding .an irtime

prevent the wheat men from marketing
their product. He also suggested the ap
pointment of a committee to carry the ln

resolutions were adopted anr] Chairman

was decided, in view of the apparent end

plained at- length a co-operative plan by
which lie thought great benefit might be
brought to the grain, raisers. He ex
plained . the matter in detail and offered
his. experience to bring the matter -into

He spoke of the commercial 1 field. opened
in the Orient and said that' the fruits of
Dewey's victory were being dissipated by
reason of an . alleged . grievance Von the
part of union labor of which no one could
give an intelligible idea. "As to its.ul

declared .there, -was .no question. Ki : ;'
*.'\Vhlle every - interest in the -United

said Mr. Green, "the farmer stands, idly
by, grows his crop and markets it as* Tiest
he can. You -may call this^movement a
.'trust'- if you like, but the average:grain
grower is dependant upon some one else
for 'what little he can get for his, crop.
The time for action is ripe and- the only
