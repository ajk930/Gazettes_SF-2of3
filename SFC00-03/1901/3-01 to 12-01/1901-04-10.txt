Understanding the impossibility of China
paying such an Indemnity, Secretary Hay,
after the' Cabinet meeting to-day," sent in
structions to Rockhill directing him to
endeavor to reduce the claims to at least
J200.000.000. and $100,000,000, if possible. If
it is necessary to " accomplish this the
United States will reduce its claim to
$12,500,000. '
Japan is known to have expended $25,'
000,000 for military expenses, her counselor
of legation was killed . and the ' property
of her citizens i in Tientsin and elsewhere
was destroyed. Her military expenses are
large by reason .of the fact that outside
of Russia she sent the largest military
force to Chinaâ 22,573 men. The United
States filed a modest' claim for $25,000,000.
Of the jrreat powers, Germany, of
course, has the heaviest . claim, which
amounts to $80,000,000. By reason, of the
failure of the Manchurian ] convention,
Russia is compelled to submit claims for
the destruction of her railroad property.
France has submitted- a' large, claim, as
her missionaries Â¦ were * slaughtered and
their missions destroyed. : ' ; ,- ,. Â¦
It is impossible to obtain an exact esti

for the reason that the dispatch received
by Secretary Hay to-day from Commis
sioner Rockhill is withheld from publica
tion.. It is known, however, that eleven
powers have submitted .demands for in
demnityâGermany, Russia, France, ' Ja

Holland, Belgium and Portugal landed no
men in China and suffered comparatively

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
CAPE TOWN, April 9.â The Government reports that Scheepers' comman
do has divided. The larger portion, under Scheepers, is clinging to the
mountains on the Aberdeen-Murraysburg: road. It Is an extremely diffi
cult country to operate in. The British have kept the invaders moving
with some success. Major Multlns of Scobell's column has captured a Boer camp
near Roodeport. A patrol of the Second Brabant's Horse under Major Arbuth
not was captured in the dense bush early last week. Commandant Fouchee has
been kept moving in the Murraysburg and Richmond districts. Fouchee Is ap
parently awaiting instructions from Scheepers. He invariably declines engage
ments. Commandant Kritzinger has sent his worn out men and horses to join
Van Reenan. The latter's sub-commanders have gone west from Dreifontein to
ward the Middellburg district, where they are probably awaiting a general con
centration of forces operating In that area. A part of the invading commando
who had been driven north attempted to swim the Orange River, but failed. They
finally crossed to Ondefontein with the aid of one boat. They were attacked on
the north bank and scattered, fleeing north of the railway. They have been at
tacked in desultory fashion more than once, but without loss. General Dewet is
reported to be- west of Heilbron with Steyn. Commandant General Louis Botha,
who has been with General Dewet, has returned to the Transvaal.
LONDON, April 9.â Lord Kitchener, reporting to the War Office under date of
Pretoria, April S, says: "Plumer has occupied Pietersburg with slight opposition.
He captured two locomotives and thirty-nine trucks."
The capture of Pietersburg is regarded here as important. The place is the
termination of the Railway and has been the capital of the Boer government
since the evacuation of Pretoria. The whole Northern Railway is pow in the
hands of the British. According to Kitchener's dispatch, one officer and one man
were killed. The Boers evacuated the town during the night prior to Plumer's
arrival, after blowing up two trucks laden with ammunition.
Kitchener also reports the capture of sixteen prisoners, fifty horses and the
depot cf war stores at Bcschmans Kop, Orange River Colony.
As an offset, the commander-in-chief reports that a hundred men of the Brit
ish Lancers and Imperial Yeomanry were attacked by 400 Boers to the northward
cf Aberdeen, Cape Colony, and that after several hours' fighting the British were
surrounded and captured, with the exception of twenty-five who succeeded In
m^Lking theJr escape.
A#special from Paris says: Le Rappel, which has already published several re
markable statements as to the plans of Mr. Kruger, displays the following dis
patch from The Hague this morning: 'â¢',.> . . Â¦
"Mr. Kruger's departure for the United States has been fixed for May 31. He
will lecture In Tammany Hall about June 8 as the guest of the Democratic party."
A Berlin special says: It Is officially reported that while Dr. Steubel of the
Colonial Department of the German Foreign Office was in London a mutual agree
ment was reached between Germany and Great Britain regarding Germany's
claims to indemnity for Germans evicted from the Transvaal.
NEW ORLEANS, April 9.â The suit of the Boer representatives here against
the agents of the steamship Anglo-Australian, to prevent the shipment of mules
and horses through New Orleans to South Africa for the use of the British army,
was taken up for trial to-day before Judge Parlange in the United States Circuit
Court. General Pearson of the Boer army and a number of British army officers
were among the spectators. Depositions on the part of the defendants denied
that they were carrying munitions of war and that their vessels were not armed
to repel attacks, and declared they were engaged simply In peaceful transporta
tion purposes. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that the shipment of. mules
from Xew Orleans was a violation of the neutrality laws and was conducted un
der the supervision of British officers, and, as this was the base "_ of supplies,, the
court here was authorized to act. The defense claimed that they Were engaged in
legal business: that the mules were- not munitions of war and that the matter was
political and in the hands of the executive branch of the Government and with
out the jurisdiction of the courts. The court took the matter under advisement.
The steamship Anglo- Australian cleared to-day for Cape Town with 1000 mules.
EDWARD'S EMBASSADOR
IS HOOTED IN BERLIN
Great Display of Troops and Police Fails to Pre=
vent Cries of "Down With the English."
BERLIN. April 9. â At the reception to-day of the British special mission to an
nounce the death of Queen Victoria and the accession of King Edward VII, Empe
ror William wore a British Admiral's uniform, with the Order of the Garter. After
the formal ceremonies were over His Majesty conversed affably with each member
cf the mission and then conducted them to an adjacent room and introduced them
to the Empress. The members of the mission are the Emperor's guests while here.
The ceremony of conducting the mission to the palace was Imposing. The Em
r<>ror sent to fetch them three elaborately ornamented court carriages, with gor
geously liveried coachmen and lackeys. The military department escort of the
mission was from the regiment of which the late Queen Victoria was honorary
colonel.
The r*>lice were much in evidence and kept the streets clear of people a hun
dred yards above and below the Hotel Bristol and halfway across Unter den Lin
den. This precaution is said to have been taken to avoid an unusual anti-British
demonstration like that of Sunday night, when, upon the arrival of the'mlssion, a
number of persons crowded in front of the Hotel Bristol and shouted "Down with
England!" "Victory for the Boers!" which caused four or five arrests to be made.
It was the first time in the history of Prussia that such an honor as being es
corted to the palace in royal carriages was paid to an embassador. A band of music
stationed in the courtyard of the castle played "God Save the King" as the mis
sion entered. â¢â¢' â¢
His Majesty received the mission with great ceremony. After, the Duke of
Aberccrn had handed King Edward's autograph letter to the Emperor and the
mission had been received in audience by_ the Empress, the Duke of Abercorn and
his party were re-escorted to the Hotel Bristol by the cavalry detachment.
The commissioners did not wholly escape a demonstration of Anglophobism.
There were shouts of "Down with the English!" outside of the hotel. In spite of
the strong police force on duty Jn its vicinity.

ALL EUROPEAN LINEN
SPINNERS FORM TRUST
Gigantic Combination to Reduce the Product
and Increase the Price of- Yarn.
WASHINGTON. April 9.â Information ' concerning the formation of, what
ameants to a gigantic trust embracing every linen spinning concern on the con
tinent of Europe has reached the State Department In a report from United
States Consul Mahon at Reichenburg, Austria. For some time, says the Consul,
it has been understood that the Austrian. German and Belgian spinners of linen
thread had decided to unite in a reduction of product. From Paris has come the
news that the French spinners are also' to join in reducing the output cf the
mills. The object Is believed to be to steady, and possibly to enhance the price
of linen yarn. Makers of linen' cloth have.jduring the fall and winter, suffered
fn?m the high price of yarn, and this enormous combination will make condi
tions still worse, says the consul.

Mrs. Frank King to-night received a telegram from her husband, which In
formed her that Alexander had been killed, and adding, "I "did not do It." Mrs.
King had heard reports of the killing and of the arrest of t Sam King, and thought
her husband had been arrested. The Kings are well known here and highly re
spected. 1 .'
A peculiar feature of the case was the interest taken in Alexander by. two
school teachers of Yuma, who persisted In sending him roses and were active in
raising money to aid him in his defense In court. The young women were infatu
ated with Alexander and did not try to conceal it.
The crime for which Alexander was sentenced to serve life imprisonment in tha
penitentiary was one of the most bloodthirsty ever committed in the Territory. Ha
went to the ranch of Burns, south of Yuma, to serve papers ousting the Burns
family from the land, which they had cultivated and insisted upon holding. Alex
ander was a constable at Yuma at that time. He was accompanied to the ranch
by Miller and Fain, who were interested In gaining possession of the land. The
two men remained in a wagon on the road while Alexander went to the house.
The officer found that Burns was away, but Mrs. Burns and her children were in
the field close to the house. Alexander approached her and a quarrel followed.
Alexander raised his shotgun and fired, the charge entering the woman's body,
killing her instantly. Alexander went straight to Yuma and gave himself uo.-
Frank M. King is a well-known cattle man of Tucson. The King family has
a record for nerve and not one member of the family has died from natural causes.
They are a family of "gun fighters," but have always fought fairly and never
have been known to do underhand work. For this reason the friends of the
Kings here refuse to believe that one of them killed Alexander to-day.
Great excitement prevails in Yuma over the killing of Alexander. Mystery sur
rounds the whole affair and the person who fired the shot probably will never be
known. Officers are at work to-night on several clews. Those who know Sam King
here do not believe that he did the shooting, as he is not the kind of man to shoot
from behind. *He has a record for many daring deeds performed as a border rider,
in which work he was engaged many years in Arizona. Later he was engaged by
W. C. Greene, during the siege at La Camanea mining camp, in Sonora, and with.
a* force of men stood off the attacks made by opposing forces In their efforts to
gain possession of the rich mines. .. ;
" Sam King, a brother of Mrs. Burns, the woman murdered by Alexander, was
"arrested on suspicion, but no proof can be obtained that . he did the shooting.
With his brother, Frank M.. King of Tucson, he has been In Yuma attending tha
trial of Alexander. <Â¦ -y " '^ ,'^- ;
The King brothers have taken an active part in meting out justice to Alex
ander, Fain and Miller, who are charged with the killing of Mrs. Burns. When
Fain attempted to escape, Frank and Sam King took the trail after him, and
when they were close upon Fain, he made his way back to Yuma and gave him

slowly with the prisoner a rifle report was heard and a bullet struck Alexander,
mortally wounding him. He fell at the feet of the officers, without uttering a
word. No smoke could be seen by the oflicers, and there was no sign as to where
the shot came from. It was evident that the shooting was done from long range,
perhaps from some house or barn in the outskirts of the city.

The price of Burlington stock was made so high that on Monday, when it was
found that offer must be still further advanced, the Union Pacific interests,
which had been offered a share in the proposition, withdrew from all further con
sideration of the. matter. What Morgan's opinion will be on the matter still re
mains to. be learned, but as his chief interest is now centered in Erie, it is be
lieved that the high price will be paid. Burlington guaranteed by the Northern
Pacific for the benefit of the Erie is, Indeed, a strange proposition when calmly
considered. V â¢' ~
It is understood that both the Great Northern and Northern Pacific will shar<Â»
in issuing the collateral trust bonds, but how this matter is to be arranged could
not be learned to-day. The integrity of Burlington will, of course, not bo
changed, it continuing in much the same way as the Lake Shore does under the
New York ' Central collateral trust. Burlington shareholders will not be called
upon to take any action in the matter. The proposition will, however, have to be
submitted to the shareholders of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, and
it will require a two-thirds vote of the stock to approve the arrangement. Of
course, with Hill's enormous holdings both of Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific, no apprehension is felt that the plan will not be approved.
' Â§Â¦ ' Â¦ : â Â« ..-* ;
On Friday last in Boston, Hill and his associates were in conference with
leading Burlington, shareholders^ until midnight. The offer submitted at that tima
was rejected â¢ because of the demand of the Burlington interests for some in
crease, both in the price at which bonds were to be N issued and the alternative
price on the stock'. The first point was conceded, however, but the alternative
price on the stock was not assented to until to-day.
NEW YORK, April 9.-K was definitely stated to-day that the final details of
the Burlington deal had been arranged by James J. Hill and that all that now
prevented formal announcement was a reference of the matter to J. Pierpoot
Morgan upon the r.rrival of the steamship Teutonic at Queenstown or Liverpool.
For a third time apparently the price that Hill and his associates offered for the
property has been advanced, and as it now stands, it is understood to Include an
offer, of '4% per cent collateral trust bonds, issued at $225 for each share of
Burlington stock, with an alternative offer to purchase the shares of non-assent

General Miles is confident that the Cubans
will- ultimately accept the Platt amend
ment defining the relations that shall ex
ist between Cuba and the United States.
General Miles and other officials of the
War Department lay stress upon the use
of the term "substantially as follows" !>i
the preamble to the Platt amendment a3
Incorporated in the army appropriation
law. This law authorizes the President
to withdraw from the island so soon as
the Government shall have been estab
lished under a constitution, which shall
define the future relations of the United
States. In -the phrase "substantially aa
follows" the administration holds that
"substantially'-* means that while the lan
guage employed by the United States may
not be used by Cubans, yet they shall
incorporate in their constitution the es
sential points fixed upon by Congress. At
the same time the President has some
slight latitude which will enable him to
use his judgment In passing upon any
resolution which the convention is expect
ed finally to adopt.
In discussing the Cuban question Lie.i
tenant General Miles, who recently visit
ed Cuba, said to-day: ..
"I do not understand that the Cubans
have absolutely rejected the Platt amend
ment. I hope the convention will do noth
ing rash. "While in Cuba. I found some op
position to the provisions of the Pint',
amendment, but I joped and still hope
It will be modified by further considera

- The equestrian statue. of Logan repre
sents seven years of labor in the quarry
of Franklin Simmons, the sculptor, and
marks a departure In sculpture in Wash

bronze. Congress appropriated $50,000 for
the statue and $15,000 was contributed by
the Grand Army of the - Republic. The
pedestal is twenty feet high. On its west
face is a group representing General Lo
gan - in consultation with leading officers
in the Army of the Tennessee. In this
group are portrait bronzes of Generals
Dodge, Hazen. Slocurn, Leggett Mower
Blair and Captain Strong.**. Â¦Oh the east
face of thepedestal is a. group represent
ing General Logan taking the oath as
United States Senator, which is being ad
ministered by Vice President Arthur In
this group are portrait. bronzes of Sena

Miller, Voorhees and Thurman. The south
front cf the pedestal is embellished with
an allegorical figure of war arid the north
with another of peace. ": The equestrian
statue rises above tlio pedestal fourteen
and a : half feet. General Logan, facing
south, is ,â¢ represented as riding along a
line of battle,. his. horse moving forward

President McKihley.'s. Tribute.

as he was introduced * and it was some
time :Â¦ before he could begin his remarks..
He spoke as. follows: ' â¢ ~ - ~ , ' . â¢ â¢ i
;My fellow-citizensâ It is a good token when
patriots | -are honored and patriotism exalted.
Monuments which express the nation's grati
tude for great deeds inspire great deeds. The
statue unveiled to-day proclaims our country's,,
appreciation of one of her heroic sons whose
name is dear to the American people, the ideal
volunteer soldier of two wars, the eminent Sen
ator and commoner, - Genenal John A. Logan.
â¢ General Logan's career was unique. His dis
tinction does -not-: rest upon his - military
achievements alone. His services in the Legis
lature of his own State, in the national House
of Representatives and in the Senate, of the
United States, would have, given him an equally
conspicuous place in > the annals of the coun
try. He was great in the forum and in the
field. >
Some names instantly suggest a sentiment.
That of Logan stands for exalted patriotism.
This avas the key of his success. Party politics
to him were nothing when the Union: was in
danger. *â¢' Â¦ . . : \
Logan was never half-hearted. An 'intense
, patriot, he was also an intense partisan. He
1 was forceful in the Senate, as â¢ he was un
daunted in battle. He had convictions and
followed them to their conclusion at any cost.
He was "never a trimmer nor a laggard: He
despised duplicity, was the soul of frankness
and always at the front in every struggle,
civil or military, during the years of his event
ful life. He was a leader from boyhood, the
recognized I captain amqng his youthful associ
ates. His integrity was pronounced and served
him > well, as Integrity will serve every' man
who has and keeps it. His success was found
ed on good character, unfailing* sincerity, high
cpurage and unremitting industry.
With; Highest Military. Honors.
He camfl-out of the war with the highest
military honors of the volunteer soldier. Bril
liant in battle and strong ill military council,
his was also the true American spirit, for when
the war was ended he was quick and eater to
return to the peaceful, pursuits of civil life.
"While a' strict disciplinarian, he was yet be
loved by all his men. No duty was too hazard
ous for them to ' cheerfully undertake and no
sacrifice was too great for them to undergo
when I he I commanded. He was not ' only con
siderate and tender of the soldiers whom he
led -but" generous and courteous 'to his brother
officers. , â¢ Â¦ â¢ , - Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦".'-; - Â¦ - â¢'Â¦ :.
, As a popular orator, his voice has been heard

Charles H. Allen of Porto Rico was asked
to-day to make a statement to The Call

inhabitants of the island were at the point
of starvation. -iÂ» ..... .
"I have not seen the original petition,"
replied Governor Allen, "but a copy of it
came to me my mail this morning from
the Secretary of Porto, Rico, who said
that he understood it was the work of a
malcontent who has been consistently op
posing the American administration ever
since our occupation of the island and
that any number of signatures could be
added to the petition in the office where
it was written. I think it would be com
paratively easy to secure signatures to a
petition asking for government aid where
such aid had been so generously dis
tributed.
: "The conditions described in the petition
are not truthfully stated. Facts will show
that more persons are employed in Porto'
Rico to-day than evÂ»ir before, except when '
the Government relief work was at its
height. â¢ The United States Government
has already distributed $1,250,000 to. work

"Civil government is * established in

the people can be relieved of their agi

XEW YORK, April 9.â A feature of the
examination of Valet Jones In to-day's ses
e!on of the hearing concerning the death
cf William Marsh Rice, the Texas mil
lionaire, was a line of questioning, which
led to a heated scene at the nocm receÂ«s
between Attorney Moore, who represents
Lawyer Patrick, and Assistant Distnct
Attorney Osborne.
Ktte 'caiise of- the -dispute was Mr; Os-
Ixsrnc's success in wringing- from. : VaJet
Jones certain agralnst Patrick.
Frederick House is one of Patrick^, law
yers. Previous to Jones' turning State's
evidence House represented the. valet also
By a ruling cf the court Osborne was al
tawed to ask the witness what he, and
Patrick had told their lawyer at the &c<t
interview In the Tombs. Jones replied
tfiat It was a complete confession of mur
<ler. differing not at all from his story at
the hearing. . ' : Â¦' Â¦ " ' M '
Purlng ail the long cross-examination of
Jones, which ended only an hour before
' recess, Moore made It apparent that his
pledge-hammer questions were- all fllrect
ed at one point. He sought to show that
Jones' story was concocted at the insti
gation of some of the men Interested in
disproving- the second Rice will. He laid
special stress upon Jones' conversations
with Captain Baker, executor of the first
will. The cross-examination was full of
insinuations a"nd recriminations against
J6nes, Mr. Osborne and Mr.' Battle, the
latter Jones' special counsel.
When at Jast Moore said, ""We- are
through with the witness." Osborne. in re
buttal asked quietly: "Jones, to whom did
you first tell the stcry of ycur having
chloroformed Rice? I mean the story, you
told here?" . , '. '
''To House," was the reply.
The question apparently "was a surprise.
House flushed and looked hard at the
table. Patrick tugged at his beard and
Moore sprang to- his feet. 'â¢ v .-Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .'-">'
. "We object to that question," he shout
ed. "We have some rights T 'in this court.
Anything the witness said to -his counsel
Involves the prisoner. It is a professton.il
confidence which must not be revealed "
But Justice Jerome only said: "Objec
tion overruled," and Jones then described
at length his first interview with House
in the Tombs counsel-room. On Patrick'^
advice he had told the truth, he said. "I
told House that I murdered Rice." ealÂ«l
Jones. "I told him. that I gave him mer
cury pills, where I got the chloroform and
all about it."
"Did you tell him about the oxalic
acid?"
"Yes."
"And what did House say?"
"He told Patrick that it would not do
for him to put all the blame op me; that
he was as much in it as I was."
Osborne brought out the fact that the
talk â¢with House occurred several . days
before the District Attorney had the faint
est idea that the prisoner would make a
confession.
"What did Patrick say to House?" Os
borne asked.
"Why. he explained that . we had put
Rice out cf the way because the drafts
were coming due from Texas," said Jones.

BRAIN FOOD

; Nearly every one will admit that as
a nation we eat too much meat and too
little of vegetables and the grains.
For business men. office men and clerks,
and in fact every one engaged In seden-
tary or indoor occupations, grains; milk
and vegetables are much more healthful.
Only men engaged in a severe outdoor

diet and continue In health. Â¦ ". , . . .
As a general rule, meat once a day is
sufficient for all classes of men,, women
and children, and grains, fruit 'ar/d yege- '
tables should constitute the bulk*df food
eaten.
But many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion and it is :of no
use to advise brain workers to ear large-
ly of grains and vegetables where the
.digestion is too weak to assimilate them
i properly.
It Is always best to get the best re-
sults from our food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meals to assist the relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years' experience have
- proven Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to be
a very safe, pleasant and effective dl-
?restive and a remedy which may be taken
daily with the best results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hardly
be called a patent- medicine, .as they do
not act on the bowels nor any. 1 particular
organ, but only on the food eaten. Thefr
supply wHat weak . stomachs lack pep-
sin diastase, and by stimulating the gas-
tric glands Increase the natural secretion
'of hydrochloric acid. V
People who make a- a dally practice' of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal are sure to have
perfect digestion, -which means perfect
health.
There is no danger of forming an .In-
jurious habit, as the tablets contain ab-
solutely nothing but natural" digestives-
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
no place in a stomach medicine . and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are jcerfaihly
the best known and most popular of all
stomach remedies.

Those interested In the contest set up
the* charge that undue influence. had been
used with Frue in the making of the
deed and the will, and also that at the
time the instruments were, made he was
totally Incompetent to comprehend his
acts.
It is said a compromise has been reach
ed and that Mrs. Frue will settle with ner
husband's creditors. In lieu of this
the contest was dismissed.
SAN JOSE, April 9.â The contest over
the estate of William B. Frue, the mil
lionaire mining man, who died here on
December 2, has been abandoned by Pub
lic Administrator Kell, and letters of ad
ministration will now be granted to John
H. Suits, a brother of Mrs. Frue. A dis
missal of the contest was filed to-day. *
Sensational features were promised in
the contest. Shortly after Frue's death
a deed transferring all his property, real
and personal, to his wife was filed for
record. Frue. who was a son of W. B.
Frue, the inventor of the concentrator
bearing his name, was estimated to pos
sess nearly a million dollars. This had
been inherited from his father and, be
sides a ranch in Monterey County, his
wealth consisted principally of bonds and
securities. He left a number of creditors,
who, fearing they would suffer ' through
the deeding of his property' to his wife,
prevailed upon Public Administrator
Kell to apply for letters of administration.
As soon' as this step was taken Mrs. Frue
produced a will in court, by which the
entire estate was left to her, it being
stated the testator was satisfied that she
would care for their only son, a boy of
seven years. It was asked that John H.
Suits, her brother, be granted letters of
administration.

THE LATE WILLIAM J. KETLER, A PROMINENT CITIZEN OF LARK
SPUR, WHO HAS ANSWERED THE CALL OF D2ATH. FROM A PHO
TOGRAPH BY BELL OF WASHINGTON, D. C. > ;
OAKLAND, April 9.â "By virtue of the
authority vested in me as supreme record
keeper of the Supreme Tent of the
Knights of the Maccabees of the "World
I hereby dedicate this temple to the uses
of the order."
The Impressive dedicatory ritual of the
Maccabees had proceeded smoothly to its
close this afternoon, the high priest of the
order, standing at the altar In his flowing
robes, had invoked omnipotent benedic
tion on the new place of meeting, when
Supreme Record Keeper Siegel arose and
pronounced the final words.
The new building at the corner of Elev
enth and Clay streets is one of the most
handsome in the city. It was elaborately
decorated with palms and evergreens for
to-day's exercises. The dedication proper
took place this afternoon. To-night a
more popular programme included ad
dresses by President I>avid Starr Jordan
and Mrs. Lillian M. Holllster, supreme
commander of the Ladles of the Macca
bees.
The subject of Dr. Jordan's address was
"Fraternities." He said. In part:
I haven't come here to tell you anything
about the Maccabees, because any one of you
could tell me more on that subject than I
know myself. My experience In the general
line of the subject on which you have asked
me to speak has been confined mostly to my
life in my college fraternity, which I recall
as one of the most valuable parts of my un
dergraduate training. â¢ -
In general the spirit of fraternallsm Is nltru
lFtic in the original meaning of that term.
Since every right-minded man . desires to be
the most that he can. and since one's own
development must depend largely upon the at
tainments of others, the right relation between
men and women in society is the kind rela
tion; the relation of co-operation, of working
together. Co-operation, self-activity, mutual
help, .these are three principles essenflal to
stable and progressive society.
It has been said that the Bank of Human
Kindness Is one'on which every one may draw.
This kindness should help every one who re
ceives it to be strong. Charity which does not
expect action, co-operation. Is weakening. It
I 13 for this reason. I take it. that fraternal
_if=m makes a valid and successful claim upon
the members of civilized society everywhere"
The growth and strength of fraternallam is a
vindication of its merit.
Mrs. Lillian M. Hollister addressed the
members of the order on the growth anl
alms of the Maccabees, exhorting them
to give the organization their loyal sup
port. At the conclusion of his address the
ladies of Oakland Hive No. 14 tendered
the supreme commander a reception at
which all the members were given an
opportunity to meet him personally.
An excellent musical programme was
provided for the evening, the numbers be
ing interspersed between the addresses
and continuing during the reception.
The ladies of the local hive of the La
dies of the Maccabees gave a luncheon
to Mrs. Lillian M. Hollister at the Hotel
Metropole at noon time to-day. Â¦ The
tables Â¦were verv handsomely decorated
and a very elaborate menu was served.

FRESNO, April 9.â M. Theodore Kear
ney, president of the California Raisin
1 Growers' Association, has issued a state â¢
ment regarding the advertised cut in the
price of raisins. He says that through the
unsatisfactory management of the raisin
market by the directors who have just
gone out of office 1400 carloads remain Jn
the hands of the association, 900 more than
the trade could be expected to take, be
tween now and the marketing: of the new
crop. To relieve the market and at the
same time popularize the use of raisins
it is proposed to put up seeded raisins
in pound cartons, mark them "Cut price,
10 cents, to further introduce seeded rais
ins. Try them," and retail them all over
the East. This proposition would net the
growers 3 cents a pound for the first 200
cars, with an advance of a quarter of a
cent a pound for the next 200 cars, and so
on. President Kearney admits that this is
a cut in the market price established by
the association, but claims that the adver
tising brand will prevent its being consid
ered a basis for future prices or future
action.
CUT Hf PRICE OP RAISINS.
If, at the end of fifteen days, the experi
ment prove a success, It is said, the price
will be continued.
The general opinion prevails that the
association will have to be reorganized
under the old State law of Incorporation,
and that the association will endeavor to
sell all of its prunes before the June meet-
Ing, when new officers are to be elected.
A large number of growers and packers
are opposed to the reduction made to-day
by the association. They do not believe
<he time opportune, especially as the ad
vertising is creating some demand for the
prunes, and the prospects are for a short
crop.

SAN JOSE, April 9.â The disturbance
created among the prune men yesterday
by the decision of Judge Seawell In declar
ing the association contract Invalid was
further Increased to-day by the announce
ment, that the California Cured Fruit As
sociation had reduced the price of all sizes
of prunes to a two-cent basis. This is a
reduction of one cent per pound on the
domestic price. The announcement came
as a surprise, after the assurance of Presi
dent Bond and other officials ten days ago
that the domestic price would not be cut
from three cents, and also after reports
had come from throughout the State that
heavy frosts had done some damage and
the prune crop did not promise to be as
heavy as that of last year. It is the opin
ion of dealers that the market will be
greatly disturbed.
Eastern jobbers have clamored for this
reduction, and il is said that orders reach
ing nearly 200 cars had been booked with
the association, to be filled when the price
had been reduced.
Two weeks ago a reduction of three
quarters of a cent was made on prunes
for export, and since then some have been
sold. In the last fifteen days about sev
enty-five carloads have been sold at a 3
cent basis, and these buyers will naturally
object to the reduction, as this reduction
will cut all the profit out of their pur
chase.
A meeting of the directors was held this
morning. Judge Seawell's decision was
considered, and after canvassing the mar
ket It was decided to reduce the price. The
following resolution was then adopted:
Resolved, That' the association prices of
prunes now- on hand be fixed at a 2-cent basis

LOS AXGELES, April 9.â From a trip
of luxury in a handsomely appointed pal
ace car to the life of a yardman In a lum
ber yard 1^ a part of the history of Don A.
Henderson, a son of Speaker Henderson
of the House of Representatives. For 52 25
a day Don Henderson is _earnlng_his
bread by the sweat of ~his~brow"ln the
yards of the San Pedro Lumber Company.
F"or this small sum he Is lifting heavy
lumber from early morning until nigrht.
For a smaller daily stipend than many
of his father's servants receive he Is fill
ing- his hands with splinters and his life
Â¦with, experience.
Young Henderson is proud of his father,
but the father is not proud of the son, in
fact, will have nothing to do with him.
The young man has not always willingly
obeyed his father. He went to school
until he was 17, only under protest. Edu
cation had no particular charms for him.
Alter graduating from the High School
of Dubuque, Iowa, young Henderson was
sent to the Pennsylvania Military School
at Chester, Pa., but the prospect of the
life of a soldier did not please him. David
Henderson, his father, stood ready to put
Don through college and offered
him many inducements if he would
fro. but the son refused. . He was
then gent to learn the railroad
business, and, according to his
.father's idea that all trades should be
learned from the bottom of the ladder,
vjis put on a train crew. There he fell in
with associates that did not influence him
for good, and before long this son of one
of the most brilliant politicians of to-day
had drunk of the cup of dissipation. After
leaving the railroad he went to St. Paul,
where he worked in the lumber business.
When the Hendersons came to California
last summer in their private car Don ac
eompanied them, but he did not return
with them to the East. He remained In
Southern California and obtained a posi
tion with the San Pedro Lumber Com
pany, where he has been working steadily
for several months.

In taking Swamp-Root you afford natural help to Nature, for Swamp-Root Is the
most perfect healer and gentle aid to the kidneys that is to medical science.
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease Is not cor-
rectly understood: in most cases they are led to believe that womb trouble or
female weakness of some sort Is responsible for their many ills, when In fact dis-
ordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
If there is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from vour urine on
rising about four ounces, place it in a glass or bottle and let It stand twenty-four
hours. If on examination It is milky or cloudy. If there is a brick-dust settling, w
if small particles float about in it, your kidneys are in need of immediate attention.
-. If. you are already convinced that Swamp-Roof is what you need, you can pur-
chase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar size bottles at the drus stores every-
where.

/Q\ Â¦ Tanforan Park yesterday, the otie
A. iX survivor being Princess. Titania,
";_ which won because no excuses
were possible. Just as the falling
barometer at sea puts the mariner on his
jguard, there was - something about the
card that portended disaster, for it wore a
catch-ar-eatch-can look. No one particu
lar rider was able to ring up more than
one bu'ilseye, and Divina carted away the
long shot honors, winning at odds rang
ing anywhere from 20 to 40 to 1.-
Kleven cheap ones started -in the open
ing six furlong sprint, and almott any
one of the lot appeared to have a chance.
Master Cal with Nash Turner closed
favorite, and dropping into third position,
stayed there to the wire. Aphrodis, a 7
to 1 chance, ridden by Mounce, outgalned
Catherine Bravo, winning by a neck.
In a driving llnlsh Hafley astride Divina,
a Bassetlaw filly trained by Ab. Stemler
and 20 to 1 in the ring, gained the decision
by a nose over the favorite -Minerva in
the two-year-old scramble. The latter
made all the running, and to many looked
to have won. Conley on Lulette * ran
third. Many tips were floating about on
this event, the- best played ones being"
Achiljes, Graham Greene, Sileslan, "Sou
You and Lass of Langdon.
Wedderstrand riding one of his good
races .on Txvinklej- landed the gelding a
clever winner of the mile and a quarter
selling event. Rio Shannon with Doml
nick in the saddle cut out the pace, trailed
by - Florabird â¢ and Twinkler.i? In., the
stretch. Wedderstrand shook up the last
mentioned horse, and assuming the lead,
finished nearly two lengths before the fa
vorite. Faunette, a 25 to 1 shot, landed in
the show. ...
After being defeated the day previous
by Alzura, Stemler's * Princess Titania
came out in the seven furlong â¢â¢ number,
scoring a clean cut victory . over Satin
Coat. David S beat the barrier, leading
to the stretch, where he gave up, finishing
third. The Princess then went on, win
ning at leisure. The other starters were a
cheap consignment. . â¢
After noting the improvement shown by
MacGyle In his defeat of Hagerdon for the
m-e run, one would arrive at the conclu
sion that Dominick must be pounds better
In the saddle than Tommy Butler. Dan
gerous Maid was favorite for the event,
and never expressed any desire to get to
tue front. Nearly all of the upper class
men laid theirs down on Hagerdon, the en
try of Don Cameron, cutting the price to
8 to 5. Their intentions, beyond question,
were good, only Dominick on MacGyle got
up in time to receive the verdict by a
short head In l:40Vi. Dr. Cave was the
fourth starter.
Thrice beaten In succession when win-
nle O'Connor sat in the saddle, Maggie
Davis came out in the concluding six
furlong run with J. Ransch up. Any
amount of 5 to 1 could be found, and the
little mare stepped the distance off all the
way in front, in 1:13%. Doublet, a 15 to 1
shot," ran iiÂ» a neck ahead of Mocorito for
second place. O'Connor had the leg up on
the favorite, Phoenissa, which landed
fourth. Â¦ '

7. Last-i-Sunday was an exciting:, day for
"Xcal Bailey of ( the Oregon . Railway and
*Xavig-ation Company. lie started out for
' ft-'ruri' in William J.' Gorham's launch ajid
wnund up by getting a ducking and
from the water Into the arms
t of two Constables who were waiting to
put^ft. charge of .murder against him. In
'the -'meantime the young- lady . who was
,'v.ith him on the launch took an involun
'tary,triD around San Leandro Bay until
â¢j=r>th.e men\put out' 'in'* rowboats and one
'of them, after boarding: the launch, stop
Â¦pf!d "the engine.
The first s\sn of trouble upon the little
';Â¦ boat was seen from the bridge crossing
from the main land to Bay Farm Island.
* Bailey was seen to take a header into the
water, while the launch with the. young
- lafly at". the wheel kept on its way, the
'.'falr-'helrripwoman blissfully unconscious of
.'the loss of hor crew. BaHey liad grabbed
a. boathook. thinking* it was a hand rail,
and'Jt came away with him. Then when
.the young lady did learn of the sudden
â¢'(desertion- she turned the launch and made
back for the .float.
â¢ In the meantime Bailey, after sampling
the mud at two fathoms and a half, rose
to the surface and yelled lustily for help,
Jrdt-.as the ,launch kept on* he turned hi3
attention to a number 'of fishing boats
that lay In the vicinity and one of them
..picked him *up. * â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
rt*3>:as the opinion of every one on 6hore,
'the t-j"ro Constables among the number.
-. iti'alf Bailey' had* done some desperate deed
â¢ujjon the launch and, after heading it out
to'ts^a, had -jumped overheard, while the
evidence . of his : orfme was being borne
out of reach of the Aiameda constabu
gpCtfl so wJien the fishing boat brought
/him in- to drip a while the two Consta
..lilts; grabbed him and demanded his rea
â¢ sohs for jumping overboard. They were
: MJre he had shot the young lady, for they
- had see.n a gun^on.the launch, and it was
c useless for Bailey to explain that the gun
.â¢Â¦was_a 22-caliber rifie.and that the young
: lady was- --safe and sound. The Constables
; knew better" and telephoned down to the
â¢ EncinaJH "i'acÂ«t dub to put out and stop
.the launch as it pasr-pd and secure evi
dence enough to convict the prisoner.
. , Her Crew , Had , Deserted. ;.
. At about this time, however, the young
.lady went -on -a hunt for the absent and
amphibious Bailey, and not finding him
(â¢aboard the launch she turned back, a fact
>vhich -brought- proof to- the Constables
. that at lca.Â«t there was no murder done;
and when the launch came nearer and
iher young lady demanded. that some one
<omie out" and' stop her, they let the pris
oner go and turned their attention els'e-
J where. -v - ' ., **
I It was -easier- to- put out -in boats than
iti,was to board the launch, for she was
Â¦gnitfg at good speed and the young lady
Mtnew absolutely nothing about the eft
prine, so for a quarter of an hour .the
launch and the boats dodged around until
one man finally managed to swing him
self aboard. Then he stopped the engine.
It was bravely but foolishly done, for
the launch v.as out in the middle of_the
, channel and the rescuer did not Know
how to start th# engine again, so the
other boats took hold and towed the
launch back to the float, where Bailey
was etill swearing at the Constables, and

Southern Pacific Puts On a
Local for San Luis
Obispo.
"Milk Train" From Palo Alto to
This City One of Manager
i Kruttschni.tt's Inno
vations. rvÂ»
A number of changes are to be made at
once by the Southern Pacific Company,
for the convenience of patrons ot the
coast division, which will entail an entire
chenpre In the present time table.
A local train will be put on from here
to San Luis Obispo, which will leave this
city daily at 9 a. m. A train will also
leave San Luis Obispo every afternoon,
which will be run to handle the local trav
el exclusively. This will relieve the lhn
lted trains over the coast division, and no
doubt prevent the overcrowding of them.
When the new local train is put on,
which will be some time this week, tho
railroad officials claim that the Salinas
Valley people will travel on it. This new
rule will ailow the limited trains to mak;i
fewer stops at minor stations and much
faster time is sure to be made. It will
also prevent the limited trains traveling
at excessive speed between stations.
A "milk tram" is also to be put on in
the afternoon, starting from Palo Alto
and running to this city. This step has
been taken by Manager Kruttschnitt so
the trains on the division locals may make
fewer stops at way stations.
"AVe had- no idea that the travel would
be so large over the new coast division.
or that the line would be so popular," said
Manager Kruttschnitt yesterday. "We
are doing the best we can to please our
patrons, and we will make as many
changes as are necessary until we have*
the road in good working- orrler, and the
passengers are all pleased with our ser
vice."

Bob I<ong "Wins.
MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 9.â In the twen
ty-round fight between Bob Long of Chi
cago and Bobby Dobbs of Memphis to
night the Chicago man gained the decision
after sixteen rounds of very ordinary
fighting, Dobbs' seconds throwing up the
sponge, claiming their man had broken an
arm. Dobbs outpointed his opponent in
almost every round and did most of the
leading, but Long had a bigr advantage in
weight, and would probably have been
given the decision had the fight gone i.ie
limit.
The main event was tame In comparison
with the preliminary, which was to have
been for ten rounds between Young Shar
key and Young Mowatt, both Chicago
men. They gave a fast exhibition for three
rounds, Mowatt knocking Sharkey out
with three strong punches in the stomach
and jaw.
In order to secure the convention for
this city in the face of the competition of
other cities more favorably situated it was
necessary to promise that $25,000 would bo
raised to meet the needs of the convention.
This money is not to be used in defraying
the railroad expenses of the delegates, but
i3 to be expended wholly in this city.
The work of the finance committee is
meeting- with an encouraging response. A
large number of very generous subscrip
tions have been made. The Market-street
Railway Company nas subscribed $2500.
the Emporium and Golden Rule Bazaar
$500, Murphy, Grant & Co. $250, Occidental
Hotel $250, California Northwestern Rail
road $250, . Goldberg, Bowen & Co. JIOC,
Nathan, Dohrmann & Co. $100, Royal In
surance Co. $100 and the Firemen's Fund
Insurance Co. $100. Other contributions
have been made, but the above are all
that the committee is la position at pres
ent to make public. Because of the great
benefit that the influx of so many strang
ers will confer on the city and State the
committee anticipates no difficulty in se
curing the necessary funds. The finance
committee is composed of the following
business men: Chairman, I. J. Truman;
O. K. Orrick, G. J. M. Stark, Thomas
Hodge, J. F. Kingston, J. R. Wilson, Rob
ert Keys, J. H. Humphreys, W. C. Mont
gomery, F. L. Turpin. J. D. Hammond, J.
H. McCallum, E. W. Stranee.
The railroad companies have been espe
cially considerate In arranging fares. A
round trip rate of $50 from Chicago has
been granted and with the special privi
leges which have been promised the com
mittee considers it the most liberal rate
ever known. The rate not only extends to
delegates but is open -to any one that
wishes to visit the State. While the con
vention is in session excursions and spe
cial trains will be run to places of inter
est throughout the State.
During the Christian Endeavor conven
tion, held in this city in 1897,. It Is esti
mated that 48,000 people visited California.
Conditions are now more favorable and
the.- rates secured are- mucn better and
therefore the railroad companies are pre
paring to handle a much greater crowd.
, The Merchants' Association has Issued a
resolution requesting the citizens to assist
in raising the necessary funds.
Preparations for fittingly receiving
entertaining the delegates who will come
to this city in July to participate in the
fifth international Epworth League Con
vention have now commenced in earnest.
The local leaguers will put forth a de
termined effort to .furnish an entertain

TRIAL OF GLAZE
HAS SENSATIONS
W. W. Foote Finds Witness
O'Connor, a tartar to
; Cfoss-Examine.
Counsel Frequently Clash and Judge
. Is Obliged Many Times to
Call for Order in j
Court. : . i
â¢ _ /
The trial of Robert E. Glaze, â¢ on a
charge of having willfully killed his part
ner, William TTewhella, . at the Windsor
Hotel on January 14, was continued . yes
terday in Department 6 of the Superior
Court before Judge Dunne and a jury..
The proceedings of the day were sen
sational, and there were frequent bouts
between the counsel for the prosecution
and the defense, and. also between W. W.
Foote and Witness John O'Connor. O'Con
nor is the bellboy of the Windsor Hotel,
who claims to have witnessed the assassi
nation of Trewhella by Glaze, and only
the good nature of Judge Dunne pre
vented his being' sent to jail for contempt
of court. â¢ " -
O'Connor- was called by the prosecution
and testified that he had seen Glaze shoot
Trewhella from ambush, and that not a
single word had passed between the two
men. He told the oft-repeated story how
he had gone to the bar of the Windsor
Hotel to order drinks for a guest and had
then- proceeded to the kitchen to secure
some limes for the bartender. O'Connor
claims that while Trewhella was bound
for the storeroom, Glaze opened fire from
the cover of a dark alleyway and shot
Trewhella to death.
The examination of O'Connor was plain
sailing, but when Attorney Foote started j
to cross-examine the witness, there was
trouble from the start. . . -,..â¢
Witness and Counsel Clash.
Foote's questions cut O'Connor to the
quick. Of course, it was beneath the dig
nity of so prominent a member of the bar
ias is Mr. Foote to "mix things" with a
bellboy, and the more polite Foote was,
the more impertinent O'Connor became.
The witness repeatedly told the attorney
to "put questions in a proper manner";
admonished the lawyer that "this is the
Superior Court and not the Police Court";
shouted many times that "you cannot
bluff me." and went so ' far as to tell
Attorney Foote that he "could not get an
answer to a question unless- it was put in
a way that a man with sense could under
stand."
The fire of questions and reply was
interjected with repeated objections from
the District . Attorney .and. admonitions
from Judge Dunne to counsel on both
sides and to the witness. Time and time
again the Judge called the witness to or
der and warned him that but for the fact
that he, the witness, was a youth and not
familiar with court procedure, a term In,
jail would have been his fate. .
. Although Foote tried his utmost to tan
gle the bellboy in his testimony, O'Connor
stuck to his story and never deviated the
slightest on cross-examination. When an
adjournment was taken at noon, O'Connor
was warned by the District Attorney to
be more respectful toward the counsel
for the defense,, and on taking the witness
stand at the afternoon session O'Connor
was as mild as a lamb under cross-exami
nation.
' Damaging Evidence Presented.
There were frequent wrangles between
Foote and District Attorney Byington and
his assistant, Greany, especially when the
prosecution called witness Jaggi.
"Whom are you calling," said Foote. .
"McAllister?". ,
"No." replied: Greany; "we called
Jaggi." - - |
"Oh, I guess you are used to that," j
answered Foote,, with a sneer. â¢ ' \
"No, we are not," retorted Greany,
"and if we are, they do not cost as much
.as yours do,, and we pay for them our
selves."
Judge Dunne then took a hand and 
warned counsel against the' use of- such
language, and the lawyers- were thence
forth on their good behavior. I . ... '
Walter T. Sachs, who was stopping at
the Windsor Hotel on January 14, testi- I
fled to having ordered the drinks men- j
tioned .by witness O'Connor, about five i
minutes before the shooting. The witness
stated that he heard the. shots fired.
Alfred Jaggi and Fred Mentz, tailors
employed next door to the Windsor Hotel
testified that tihy heard pistol shots in
the inner court of the hotel and looked
down from the windows of the room they
were in to see what the trouble was. Both
men positively testified that they saw i
Glaze breaking his pistol and reloading i
the weapon.
A wordy war took place between oppos
ing counsel when witness Jaggi stated
that Glaze was "cool and collected."
Foote objected to any "expert testimony"
from the witness, and the District Attor
ney managed to get the evidence in by
changing the form of his questions. The I
case will be resumed this morning at 10 I
o clock. .

TALE OF CRUELTY
STOPS FUNERAL
Autopsy at Morgue Does Not
1 Substantiate Neighbor- {
hood Rumors.
!i v :: :: â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
I Â¦ â -,
The funeral of Aileen Sutliff, the four
year-old daughter of Thomas B. â¢ Sutliff
of 1912 Central avenue, was stopped yes
terday by the Coroner at the Instance of
' neighbors,' who told of cruelty and starva
tion that had caused the child's death.
The body was taken _to the Morgue in its
1 little white coffin and an autopsy held,
which did not bear out the story of
cruelty, and credence ,is given to the
father's assertion 'that a grudge against
his. wife inspired the tale.
The child was to have been burled at
2:30 p. m. Father Jones of St. Dominic's
i Church was to have officiated. Shdrtly
before noon Beverly Hughes, a butcher
boy employed by W. F. Roberts of 2817
street, telephoned to the Cor
oner's office that several women had told
him that the child had been cruelly treat
ed and beatings and neglect had caused
its death. One of them, Mrs. Philip Hal
; pin of 3126 California street, had asked
him to notify the Coroner. A little later,
a second message came by telephone to
the same purport. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Deputy Coroner McCormick, who was in
charge, notified the undertakers not to
proceed with the funeral and sent Deputy
Brown to investigate.
Brown found . the neighbors whose
names had been given him unwilling- to
make definite charges of cruelty. Two
women had seen the child. fishing a piece
of bread out of a swillbarrel and another
had' seen the mother strike little Aileen.
The story bruited about was that con
stant mistreatment of the child had
caused it to waste away and die.
Most remarkable of the stories afloat is
one to the effect that Mrs. Sutliff hated
the child, not believing it to be her own.
It was born at the maternity cottage of
the Children's Hospital, and, the story
runs, Mrs. Sutliff always believed that
several babies born at the same time were
mixed and their identity lost,- the wrong
one being given to her.
Sutliff brands this. story as absurd and
says that Aileen was the image of him
self. Mrs. Sutliff is ill and has not been
informed of the interference' with the fu
neral. Sutliff claims that the women who
circulated the stories of cruelty bear a
grudge against his wife because she has
not seen fit to associate with them. *.'.'Â¦
Â¦ Dr. John M. Williamson,, who attended
the child in Its illness, certified that death
was. due .to. mesenteric tuberculosis. He
Bald yesterday afternoon that the child's
wasted appearance and feebleness . was
due entirely to the disease, and that he
had seen no indications of other than the
kindest treatment. The Sutliffs have four
other little girls, : who are .healthy and
have evidently received excellent care. .
1 Dr. Louis Badgalupl, autopsy, surgeon
at the Morgue, performed the autopsy and
promptly confirmed the report of'Dr.-Wil
liamson. An inquest may be . held, Â¦ how
ever,, to give those who were .instrumental
In stopping the funeral an opportunity to
tell their stories under oath.
BALLYHOO BEY GOES WB0NG.
Whitney's Brown Colt Said to Have
Developed Into a > Roarer.
' NEW YORK, April 9.â "W. C. Whitney's
brown colt, Ballyhoo Bey, one of the
crack 2-year-olds of last year and winner
of Futurity stakes, is reported to have
turned Into a roarer. "While there is doubt
about his racing again, it Is almost certain
he will not be as great a 3-year-old as his
brilliant races last season promised.
A story that all was not well with the
colt was circulated to-day, and, owing to
his sickness last fall, It gained credence.
Mr. Whitney, when asked whether the re
port that Ballyhoo 'Bey would not race
again was true, made the following state
ment: "We fear his wind is affected, but
are not certain about It. . He will probably
race this year, but he may not be the
horse he was." Â¦Â¦-.-Â¦â¢â¢ ;' '/â¢ .'Â¦â¢â¢"."Â¦ â¢ .
â¢ The horse i3 at "Whitney's private stable
at" .Wheatley Hills, and \ the .latest news
concerning him f since he went into retire
ment after his : campaign last year was
that he had 'influenza last fall. At that
time several of "Whitney's^ horses were
afflicted with the disease, and Ballyhoo
Bey's-* temperature was so ,high at times
that it was feared he would not recover.

0OLONEL BY COURTESY
AND MAJOR IN FACT
True Rank of Oscar F. Long, Depot
Quartermaster, Is That of
IÂ£ajor, TJ. S. A. .
Oscar F. Long, depot quartermaster, San
Francisco, is a major in the regular army,
although telegrams from* Washington
have given some , of the newspapers tho
impression that he is again a captain. He
Is not only a major but is very nearly in
the center of the list of majors, so that
he stands a good chance of attaining the
rank of lieutenant colonel in -the regular
army within a reasonable length of time.
When the Spanish war was on he was
promoted to the rank of major of volun
teers and subsequently advanced to the
rank of lieutenant colonel of volunteers.
Shortly after peace was Droclaimed the
lieutenant colonels wtre cut out' and
Major Long's rank in this regard van
ished. After his promotion to major in
the regular army he resigned as major of
volunteers and this readjustment caused
the impression that he had resumed his
rank as captain. His true rank, however,
ln the United States armv is that of ma
jor, but the rank of lieutenant colonel
having been bestowed for meritorious ser
vice he is entitled by courtesy as well as
military custom to be addressed as Colonel
Long. As he is' in the transport service
it- may be correct on the water front to
say "Long, may he wave as colonel."
In the intermission between the three
parts of the lecture Mrs. M. McGlade and
Miss Kittle McShane sang and Miss May
Stein gave a piano number. v . Â¦
With this introduction he entered upon
the music of England. He sang three
songs, "Hearts of ! Oak," a stirring sea
song: "Rocked In the Cradle of the Deep,"
familiar to all. and "Rule Britannia." This
last song, however, he sang to words that
glorified Columbia and the "Yankee" in
stead of England and her rule over, the
seas. The pong was much applauded. .
- F*or the representatives of Scotland . he
chose "Ye Banks and Braes," ''The Land

In introducing his subject Father Mc-
Loughlin described what ballad music is
and how centuries ago, through its

of song. He spoke of the spread' of the

Another of the peculiar episodes con
nected with the Sullivan affair developed
early yesterday in Judge Mogan's court.
J. C. Wilson was arrested some time ago
on two charges of petty larceny. On
each charge $50 bail was exacted. Sulli
van drew this money from the treasury
on forged orders. When the case was
called Judpe Mogan, despite the objec
tions of Wilson's attorney, ordered the
bail forfeited. The attorney protested
and was informed that if. there was any
thing wrong about the matter he. could
present his claim for the recovery of the
bail to the Board of Supervisors. . It is
alleged that Wilson died in Arizona, but
the police are hopeful of finding him in
BALLADS OF THE .ROSE,
SHAMEOCK AND THISTLE
Sullivan Withdrew the Bail.
Sheriff Lack man n also has a little griev
ance against the treasury. He has a long
list of debits and credits between himself,
the Treasurer and the County Clerk, al!
of which arise from the present compli
cated and misunderstood conditions and
provisions of the charter. During the
month of February, 1900, Yep Gee had a
credit of $8, "W. F. Cavanaugh a credit of
$18, Pauline Prescott and Ernando Hol
land credits of $6 each for time served in
the County Jail, from fines imposed In
Police Court No. 2. In department No. 1,
Sine Fat also earned a credit of $96, mak
ing a total of $134 between the two courts.
Experts are now trying to wander through
the maze of charter-imposed complica
tions while the money remains in the city
treasury. It was paid in as bail money,
but on account of the charter's book
keeping method and red tape cannot be
drawn out.
In an exhibit filed with the Grand Jury
last nig-ht. Expert Kytka, by means of
photographic enlargements, reproduced
exemplars of Judge Conlan's handwrit
ing, embracing samples of bis genuine and
admittedly forged signatures. Out of the
twelve -exemplars two â¢ are f org-ed and the
remainder are supposed to bo genuine.
Everybody has a guess at which is the
genuine and which the forged.
Conlan's signature varied from day to
day apparently. Sullivan admits that he
forged signatures ten and eleven, but
until Expert Kytka. decided that they
were forgeries, Judge Conlan was not In
a position to declare, whether they were
or not. As the greater portion of the
amount that Sullivan is alleged and ad
mits to have obtained on . forged orders
came through Judge Conlan's court, still
other guesses are in order.
Signatures Genuine and Forged.
Police Judge Conlan was a flitting visi
tor about the halls adjacent to the jury
room and Expert Kytka had prepared a
series of photographic enlargements of
Judge Conlan's genuine and disputed sig
natures, but neither Kytka nor Conlan
was called. The-examination will be con
tinued on Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Among- the other witnesses examined
were Chief Warrant and Bond Clerk
Peerj', his deputies. Burke and Fitzpat
rlck, Captain of Detectives Seymour, J.
Kemppe, former Police Judge C. A. Low.
and C B. Perkins, but they added little to
the further information of the Grand
Jury. Although expected, no indictment
was found.
Â¦was called on March 16, when the bail
was ordered forfeited, but the entry did
not pass through the books of the War
rant and Bond Clerk until two weeks
later, the day that Sullivan left the city
secretly.
Yesterday's proceedings in the action
instituted, by Horace W. Philbrook
against ex-Supreme Court Justice Van R.
Paterson were quiet. Most of the morn
ing and -afternoon, sessions were occupied
by Philbrook's reading of the Supreme
Court record in the matter of the disbar
ment proceedings against him and tho
reading of u deposition made by Judge
Paterson during the trial of the Merrltt
guardianship cases In Oakland.
During the day Philbrook called hi*
sons to the stand under the rule that one
suing: for damages for alleged slander may
produce his family in court that the jury
may see those dependent for support upon
theplalntift. Mrs. Philbrook followed her
sons to the stand 'to testify that no one
other, than Judge Paterson: was called
during the hearing of the Merritt cases to
offer evidence as to the mental condition
of her husband. . " . M

Are Not City Property.
City Attorney Lane Says Bail Moneys
The following are extracts from a letter
sent by City and County Attorney Lane
to Treasurer Brooks in response to a com
munication sent by the last named re
questing the attorney's opinion- on the
legal method of paying out police court
bail moneys:
Bail moneys are not the property of the city
and neither the general law nor the charter
treated them as such. T,he Auditor and bond
clerk must, account to the Auditor 'each month
for all receipts, as must the Treasurer. No
police court bail moneys can legally be with
drawn from the treasury without the approval
of the Auditor .upon the order of the court.
These are my conclusions after a careful con
sideration of the related law. ' *
The warrant and bond clerk is authorized
and empowered to issue bail bonds and ap
peal bonds when the liability thereof does not
exceed $2000. He may take cash bail in the
extent in any one case of $1000.
All officers are required to daily deliver all
fees to the Treasurer and take a receipt there
for. By this procedure the bail moneys come
into the custody of the Treasurer, who places
them in the special fund. .'This fund is cre
ated for the reception of moneys which do not
belong to the city and county.
Bail moneys are in the custody "of the court,
though the charter has prescribed tbat the
Treasurer shall hold them.
It does not seem to have been the intention
of the charter f ramers to Â¦ subject moneys
which do not belong to the city to the same
elaborate process of delaying checks that pro
tects the city's funds. While therefore it is
my opinion tbat the Supervisors cannot be re
quired to pass upon such demands, this does
not authorize the Treasurer to pay out po
lice court bail moneys upon the- mere order
of the court and without the approval of the
Auditor. This latter official is the bookkeep
er of the city. He must know -what moneys
are in .all the funds.
I therefore advise that as Treasurer you
pay no demand for bail moneys deposited with
you until Â«such demand or order has received
the approval and audit of the Auditor and
that you report the drafts upon such special
fund and the deposits therein as of all other
moneys received or paid out to the Auditor.
UMATILI*A.'S CARGO
ARRIVES AT SEATTLE
Second Northern Shipment of*Califor
nia Oranges Will Be Bushed
to the East. '; :
SEATTLE, April 9. â The second . con
signment of California oranges, compris
ing 5430 boxes, or fifteen carloads, arrived
here to-night on the Umatilla of the Pa
cific Coast. Steamship line. The shipment
Is from Los Angeles and Is destined for
Minneapolis, where it. will be distributed
by the agent "of the Southern California
Truit Growers' Association. " ...
The special train conveying the consign
ment will leave here in the morning and
will take about 103 hours for the trip. The
fruit is stored in the ordinary refrigerator
cars, although two of- the cars will be
iced, by way of experiment. On the for
mer occasion the fruit ; arrived in excel
lent condition, the cool atmosphere of the
northern route obviating all necessity for
artificially lowering the temperature. The
ice now being applied Is solely for the pur
pose of ascertaining Â¦ whether it will im
part to the fruit any. merit not derived
from natural means: i
the flesh not far from the tenderloin
district. This bail was withdrawn from
the treasury on March 30 by Sullivan.
Now the question Is as to the responsi
bility of the parties concerned.
In the Sylva case, noted exclusively in
The Call of yesterday, Receiving Teller
Perkins admits that if the County Clerk
does not make the amount good he will
have to put up for the error made by
Reis, v/ho paid out the money while Per
kins was at lunch.
"It passed through my department,"
said Perkins, "and I am personally re
sponsible for the amount. Reis was the
one who paid out the money, and if it
is not straightened out some way I will
have to make the amount good."
This money was' deposited by Mosto
Sylva March 11 and forfeited the follow
ing day. The case was called in the
morning and again in the afternoon, the
defendant not appearing at either time.
Eighteen days later Clerk Rice of Judge
Conlan's court made a report of the
transaction to the County Clerk, the lat
ter obtaining a receipt from the Treas
urer, transferring the money from one
fund to another. The same day Sullivan
drew the money out of the treasury.
Who got the money is the question.
SIGNATURES EXHIBITED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY LAST NIGHT IN
ITS INQUIRY INTO THE SULLIVAN FORGERIES OF POLl'CE COURT
SCANDAL FAME. TWO ARE KNOWN TO BE FORGED.
In making an appropriation of $6000 out
of the urgent necessity fund to be used
by the Health Board in cleaning China
town and anbther for $2500 for the erec
tion of a hospital fpr contagious diseases
on the grounds of the City and County
Hospital the Board of Supervisors reck
oned without Auditor "Wells. That offi
cial declared yesterday that he would not
sign any demands on the fund named for
either purpose.
The ground on which Wells bases his
refusal to recognize the ordinance passed
by the board on the subject is that there
are a number of Supreme Court decisions
which hold that bills of one department
cannot be paid out of another depart
ment's appropriation. Wells says that the
tax budget- contains an item of $12,440 for
Health Department expenses,' and i this
alone is available for the very purpose
for which the extra appropriation of $6000
was made. If .there had -been no such
appropriation made the urgent necessity
fund could be drawn upon. The Auditor's
decision will result in stopping any work
which the Health Board may have laid
out to put Chinatown in a sanitary condi-
The Board of Public Works notified the
Auditor yesterday that it had awarded
the contract for building the contagious
disease hospital to R. Sinnott for $2341.
The board reciuested that the Auditor set
aside the sum named out of the urgent

GRAND JURY WORRIES OVER

A SEANCE of the Grand Jury was

The investigation into Sullivan's meth

that Sullivan, the self-admitted forger,

THE WORLD'S SUGAR INDUSTRY.
ONLY a short time ago reports from Russia an
nounced with considerable detail that Tolstoi
had been banished from the empire.* If was told
that he had been seen journeying toward the frontier
under the guard of Cotsacks, and a description was
given of the party. Furthermore, the cause of his ban
ishment was stated. It was said that one of the mutin
ous students who look upon the great writer as a
leader had attempted t& kill an officer of the Holy
Synod in revenge for ihe action of the Synod in ex
cemmunicatirig Tolstoi. The whole story had every
outward appearance of truth and was widely accepted
as accurate. Unfortunately, a report equally circum
stantial and told with an equal show of accuracy came
a little later, announcing that Tolstoi wishes to' leave
Russia, but that Cossacks have been stationed at his
home 4o hold him a prisoner and prevent him from
leaving the empire.
Doubtless there may be some way of reconciling the
two* stories, but it will not be worth while to try to find
it. It is safest to conclude 'that the Russian censor
ship and military surveillance combined effectualH'
prevent political information from getting out of the
empire until the authorities are ready to let it be
knewn.
It is easy, to get up reports from Russia, and there
seems to be a bureau at Berlin engaged in the business
of furnishing them. It is not easy, however,>to obtain
accurate reports. Whatsoever emanates from the land"
of the Czar is largely based upon rumor mei ely. It
may be that the men who 'gather the rumors- act in
good faith and are sincerely, trying to learn what is
going on in the big empire, but they, have to pursue
truth under difficulties.. Official information is given
cut in whatever way best suits the Government, and is
just about as likely^ to be false as to be true. . Other
information coming from secret societies, or fiom the
guarded talk of the pecple is equally subject to sus
picion. Under such circumstances anything like the

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
The Board of Public Works has been caught again
evading the terms and obligations of the civil service
law. This distinguished municipal body seems to have
been organized particularly with a view of doing just
what it should not do.* Its creator, the Mayor, ought
to make a demand upon it to do something wrong. \
Surely, the Government can heed and respond tp
complaints made with such simple directness concern
ing matters which, if trifling to us, are of great im
portance to the Alaskan natives. \ There is no reason
why the day of closing the canneries should not be
fixed for Sunday, as the newly converted Christians
desire, nor is there any reason why we should not
protect the fisheries and compel obedience to law.;
Another writes to complain that the orders of the
Government officials are not obeyed. He says: "I was
write you up to Wrangcl to tell you all about the dan?,
across the stream. They^ict taking out yet as will you
told them. They cut on top the log about six inches
deep â that was all.- I like to hear from you about that
case. You not going to do anything tuol?. Watcr
hight now, but the salmon can't go up the lake. I
hoping j'ou do something with it"
Several of the letters uige the Government to have
the fisheries closed t>n Sunday, so that they may "lead
Christian lives and keep the Sabbath day holy." . One
of the writers, who says his letter "was written in the
public of this community," informs the Government
official: "The first thing I want to say is this, that all
the people whose attention have been called to the
fishing business have been working on Sundays since
the United States law was changed. God has done" all
His work during six days, and on the seventh day He
did rest; and, therefore, we are to 'follow His Com
njandments,- as long as he puts us in existence. We
had an opportunity to do all our work (is needed to
be done) during the six days, according to the law.
iYou saw most of the people fishing on Sunday when
you came up in Alaska last summer. Almost three
thirds of them do. -not v.-ant to be in the same condi
tion, because they have tested the law <A God and are
obeying Him." â¢
It will be noted that the letter shows, for an Indian,
remarkably good command of English. Such devia
tions from the conventional English of our time as
occur are quaintnesses rather than errors. In its es
sence that letter, written "in the public of this com
munity" (Saxman, Alaska) is about as {rood as could
be prepared at a public meeting at any village in the
United States. The subject of cQmplaint is a curious
one, for A. D. Harlan, special agent of the Govern
ment, to whom it was addressed, says in his report 1 .
"Wherever I went th-re were Indians pleading with
me to use my influence to have the closed day changed
from. Saturday to Sunday, so that they would not be
required to break the fourth commandment. All the
cannery superintendents, except one, in Southeastern
Alaska said that they thought the closed day should be
Sunday, and that they did not know why Saturday was
ever made the closed dsy."
Another thing of which the natives complain is the
destruction of fish. One writer says: "We want you
to mention this in the public that all the fish in Alaska
is getting few year by year by the big canneries are.
putting up throughout the countries in the State. All
our people would have nothing to eat after the fish is
gone from each stream in Alaska, as we do not want
too many fish boats send in one stream at a time.
* * * Animals, fish, fowl, gold and others are get
ting few here in Alaska on account of tig crowd;
therefore we forbid too many persons to work at a
certain place, especially in a public property. As the
people do not want if their children starve to death in
a. couple of years."
AMONG the memoranda published in connection
with the report just issued by the Treasury De
partment at Washington upon the salmon fish
eries of Alaska there me a number of letters from
Alaskan natives urging reforms. Some of these are
sufficiently curious to be of general interest, as they
throw illuminating side lights upon certain minor
problems of the country and its people.

Such is the problem now confronting Massachu
setts/and it is to her credit that she has not shrunk
from. it. Whether any good result will follow the
discussion remains to be seen. It isnot likely that
any law can be enacted to meet the requirements of
such cases," for "they are too infrequent to be pro
vided for by. statute, but the Massachusetts people
might at least learn something from this tragedy of
the need of genuine neighborly fellowship and mutual
helpfulness. A very little /aid. would have saved this
woman, and we believe that had she lived in a, Cali-'
forma rural community she would, have found it. !
The pastor put the various .phases of the problem
in this way: "How ought the officers of the law to
address' themselves to the' poor, the unfortunate, as
the' individual br families are found within the social
order?. And what is this social order, or the 'civil
compact,' as we sometimes speak of it, by which. the
private individual is asked to surrender certain primi
tive or - natural rights and ways of self-expression,
defense and redress for crushing- wrongs? What, too,
are the sacred pledges of this social compact to the
individual which should be carried out to . secure! jifel
and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which are' t^
inalienable rights of every aspiring man, woman anW
child?" I ' Â¦ , .. Â¦â¢' V 1 -;-: : ':
The cause of the insanity being thus explained, there
comes then the further question, how far can society
and the state be held responsible before the bar of
moral judgment. The devoted, ambitious and indus
trious mother through no fault of her own had been
brought to destitution, and then the state stepped
i'n and commanded her to betake herself to the poor
house and leave her children to the control of others.
Is society in any way to, blame for such an outcome
of this woman's life struggle?
To that question the pastor himself furnished the.
am werby saying: "We all know now, as many of us did
not know before, the situation as' it has' been, and that
the .environment under which this awful change has
been wrought has 'persisted as one. of dire poverty,
overstraining toil, deep humiliation to a sensitive
nature, disappointed lovVr.'as water poured upon desert
sands, blasted hopes, until," in despair, the poorhouse
and separation from her children were the next steps
she must take. The word had just been given. her
in plain terms, and lo! as an earthquake of horror we
are summoned to the tragedy before us!"
The first question that has arisen so fearfully out
of this story was stated by the pastor who preached
the funeral sermon. over the children, in the words:
"What was. the awful process of these years which
transformed: the innocent, loving mother of these
children into such a tragic frenzy that she became
the instrument of their destruction?; Here is for us
a study of. the evolution of character upon the darkest
side!" , \
The neighbors, however, who have known the^
woman from her ,childhood, have found good reasons
for thinking a good deal more about it. Back of the
deed of maniac fury there is a story that is darker
even than the fury itself: We learn from our Boston
exchanges that Mrs. Narramore, who committed the
deed, was known to the people of Coldbrook as an
unusually bright and good woman, ambitious for her
self and for her children. Her later life, however,
has been one of poverty, hardship and ill-treatment.
She lived in dread of the poorhouse, and of what to
her, was worse, separation from her children;' and
when that dreaded end was no longer to be evaded,
she went mad and the tragedy resulted.
It will be remembered that a short time ago dis
patches from the East reported that"' a woman living
at Coldbrook had killed her six children. To the
outer world the story was merely one of those "hor
rors" of the news of the day which are 'read quickly
and then dismissed' from the mind. The woman was
clearly insane; her act was one done in the. ; frenzy of
madness; why think more about it? â¢
mASSACHUSETTS is so fond of discussing
"problems" that when no other subject is : to
the front her' thinkers turn readily to de
bates on "The Thingness of What." Just now, how
ever, they have a, subject of profound and solemn
interest, and the whole country will wait with interest
to learn what is to be the .decision. It is a question
which/ affects society in all civilized lands, and which
in one form or another has been presented over and
ever again, but rarely Â¦with; such terrible emphasis as
has been given to it in the instance that has now not
only aroused the minds but disturbed the consciences
of all earnest men and women in New England.

must be borne in mind that the. range of modern gun
shot is very long. The statement may be within gun
shot'of truth and yet be fully, a -mile away. . Reports
from Russia, then, must be Â¦"averaged." Most of them
art of the kind of news that the American people have
learned to look upon. as "important if true." The
question of; the truth of any particular report must be
left for time to develop. Perhaps Tolstoi has been
banished; and perhaps -he is under guard to prevent
him from leaving his home. The only things sure in
the matter thus far are that there is such a land tis
Russia and such a man as Tolstoi,. and that each is in
a quandary to know what to do with the other!
eratlon, Mrs. Beard, writes: "We have
prepared a traveling- library bill, which
we hope will pass the next Legislature.
Last year we had twenty-five traveling
libraries. They have gone In many direc
tions over the State where books i were Jew
and were greatly appreciated. One libra
ry of sixty-five volumes has just been sent
to an East Tennessee mining camp, where
it is eagerly awaited."
At a" meeting of the American Library
Association, held in -June, 1896, F. A.
Hutchins of the Wisconsin Free Library
Commission said in. his address while
speaking of the ' phenomenal growth of
traveling libraries: "This recent de
velopment" of the work is due to that
powerful factor, . the 'woman's . club.'
In mcst of , the States of the Union the
women's clubs are doing more than the
librarians in the establishment and spread
.of traveling libraries. When they first
commenced this work it was merely for
the purpose of sending special libraries
to the weaker clubs, but the possibilities
of the new plan as a means of helping
women and children of isolated communi
ties have appealed to them.'* , Mr. Hutch
ins has not overstated the case, and while
the traveling library was not originated
by the women's clubs, they have been the
power which is persuading the legislatures
of the States to create library, boards, or
free library commissions, and, in States
where the machinery already exists, to
add to the power of the boards that of in
corporating traveling libraries. -
At every biennial meeting of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs and at
every annual meeting of the State federa
tions the library interests of the country
ot State are discussed, and In no line of
legislative work have the federations done
more than in this. In our centennial year
the American Library Association was or
ganized, having as its motto, "The best
reading for the largest, number at the
least cost." Since that time State library
associations have been formed. The
work of popularizing libraries has pro
ceeded at a rapid pace. In 1860 the NaÂ«
tional Kducational Association invited the
co-operation of the American Library As
sociation, and in the same year the United
States Government, - through the joint
committees of Congress, asked the Amer
ican Library Association for suggestions
as to the management and scope of the
Congressional Library. Thus the Amer
ican Library Association was at once
placed in the first rank as an educational
power. Â¦ ... .
New York's First Libraries.
â¢ New York, in 1893, was the pioneer In
establishing traveling libraries as a part
of the public library system. In that
State W. R. Eastman, inspector of
libraries, has them in charge. From the
beginning the movement was a success.
In the traveling libraries of New York
the books are divided into groups as near
ly eaual as possible in the range of sub
jects and in literary attractiveness. They
are bound in cloth and are packed in a
plain oak case, on shelves, with a ! small
drawer with compartments to hold cards,
etc. A catalogue goes with each library,
and in each book is a card giving in the
briefest possible manner its scope and
character. Book cards and readers' cards
are supplied, and these cards are returned
to Albany with the library.* A library of
100 volumes can be secured for six months
by paying $5 and one of fifty volumes by
paying S3. The State pays for transpor
tation both ways, except where the library
is a&ked for by unregistered clubs, sum
mer hotels or business corporations, when
the transportation is. paid by the person
to whom the library is sent and it can
only be retained for three months.
The libraries ara scmt out under the fol
lowing conditions: First, to public libra
ries, when the trustees and librarians
must sign an agreement: second, to com
munities without public libraries, when the
application must be signed by twenty-five
resident tax payers and a resident libra
rianmust be selected and a trustee, who
becomes responsible for the books and
their, return to Albany; third, to groups
of students, who agrea to study one sub
ject not less than ten weeks, In whicc
case a guarantor is reauired.
Women's Clubs Take a Hand.
Six years ago the women's clubs began
:o engage in practical efforts on Stat
lines, for during the period from 1894 to
1S98 all the States had organized State fed
tratlons. Then the subject of library legis
lation came up at everv meeting. Mrs.
Edward Buckwalter nf Ohio has been an
earnest and eloquent advocate of the free
traveling library and at every important
meeting of the general federation has
urged the State federations and individual
clubs to adopt as an integral oart of the
State work the promotion of traveling li
braries. Not only did she present the ad
vantages of the movement but she told
how to carry it on and pointed to her own
State as an example. Ohio had a State li
brary of 60,000 volumes, to which only the
official class had access. In 1896 by the
general library law this library was placed
in. the hands of a commission, - which at
once put it in the power of any aitizen of
the State to secure upon the same
terms as are in force in local public libra
ries. After a conference with the librarv
committee the State federation the State
Library Commission agreed to send small
libraries' of twenty or forty volumes to
clubs the commission reserving the right
to call in the library after one monthâ a
right which has never been exercised â and
the club. to pay. transportation both way 3.
The club making application for a library
sent Its year books and books were selected
bearing on the topics of club study. These
libraries were made up of books already on
;the shelves, as no aproprlatlon had as yet
been ' made for new books. The results
have far exceeded even Mrs. Buckwaltei's
sanguine hopes. She reports that in Ohio
tb,e -traveling library has made possible
the country club; that of the twenty-thre3
libraries first sent out twenty went to
â¢women's clubs and two to country neigh
borhoods. As soon as the women in the
country found they could "secure books
they formed clubs; groups of women would
meet, organize- and apply , for books the
same day. Thus through the ' rural dls â¢
tricts of Ohio go the libraries, bringing the
farmers and their families into touch w'th
all that is best Inthe literature of the pasi
and the present. There are now 350 travel
ing * libraries in the Stp te and many free
public libraries have been established in
the smaller towns and villages as a re
sult of the enthusiasm for books wh'ch
the; traveling library has awakened.
Experiences of Iowa" and Michigan.
In Iowa the success of the ' library com
mission law passed by. the last Legislature
is attributed to the approval of the meas
ure by the worn en'a ( clubs. One thousand
dollars was appropriated and fifty libra
ries - of fifty volumes each were bought
For these libraries there were 125 applica
tions.- - -. . , : â¢ - .
In Michigan the traveling libraries are
largely in demand by the grange. It is
often said that the farmers will not read
but certainly the experience of Michigan
proves quite the contrary, as does that of
Wisconsin. In the latter state the travel
ing libraries are sustained entirely . by
gifts by individuals and 'associations, iln
August, 1898, . there j were ,186 1 traveling li
braries In the State. In August, 1900 there
were 238. - They are sent out almost en
tirely to the smaller villages and farming
communities. Fifty-four of these libra
ries are under the care of the free library
commission. In the work of selecting the
books f op, all the ..libraries,- fn v finding
places for them, and in training local li
brarians the commission has given its aid
and valuable experience. It has also col
lected periodicals and distributed them to
traveling library stations Â¦ and poor com
munities in > which - the commission has
found. some "good people'.' who keep them
circulating/ During the last year the com
mission has collected and distributed more
than . 16,000 copies of such magazines as
Harper's.-the Century, Scribner's and Mc-
Clure's, and more than 20,000 copies of pa
pers such^as the ; Youth's Companion,
Harper's Weekly, Ladies' Home Journal
and. the Gartenlaube. The magazines and ]
papers are keenly - appreciated - by the
farmers and by. workingmen, who are thus '
enabled' to -keep informed In modern sci
ence, modern travel and modern invention -
A;letter^ from a woman Â¦ who lives thir
teen'miles from a railway station in 4 vil
lage in the forests of northern Wisconsin
and who has the traveling library, is cited
bythe Wisconsin commission. She writes
"that the books are always out ; â¢ that one
family who . never . had " any books in the ;
home had taken ; eight . in ' the ;<â¢ last ~ two '
months. In many homes where the people

work hard all day the magazines and pic
ture papers are more , liked than the
books."
Wisconsin's Many Libraries.
Mr. Stout of Dunn County. Wisconsin,
has established at his own expense a sys
tem of traveling libraries. All he asks of
the people is to. form local library asso
ciations and return the boots in good con
dition. Mr. W. D. Wister of Wood County
and Mrs. Schaffer of Chippewa County
â¢have done the same. The ex-president of
the Wisconsin Federation of Women's
Clubs, Mrs. Charles G. Morris, has been
for four . years a member of the free
library commission, and through her in
fluence the federation has supported many
traveling 1 libraries, as well as founded
several free * . public libraries. The
Woman's Club of Wausau has fitted up
fourteen traveling libraries for the small
towns and farming communities of Mara
thon County. *
' Not the least of the advantages of such
libraries is. the effect on the social life oÂ£
the people. Whenever a library arrives
the entire community gather together and
talk books: quite a new experience to
them and in itself a- great gain. At a
meeting- of a State federation the follow
ing story was told: "The wife of a poor
farmer assumed the care of a traveling
library. The farm was situated at the
cros3 roads, and was therefore convenient
for borrowers. \ The farmer was an old
man, broken down by illness, and could
do., but little work. There were no chil
dren to heln and the wife did the best
she could to keep things going and to
earn a livinff out of the farm, but it was
uphill work. The woman loved books and
eagerly recuested that she might have
the privilege of being custodian when in
quiry was made for some one to assume
charge of the library. From that time
her affairs began to improve; as the farm
ers stopped for books they would discuss
with her the farm work, and they be
gan to take an interest in the place. She
had great difficulty in securing a compe
tent man to help in the busy season. One
of the largest farmers in the neighbor
hood assumed the responsibility of keep
ing her supplied with capable help and
he himself would oversee the work in the
outlying fields for her. The women who
came also took an interest : and remem
bered her sick husband when cooking
anything especially good. ! As she was a
great reader and had excellent Judgment,
she became the adviser of the children
who came ior something to read, 'they
did not know what.' When evening came,
her out-of-door work finished, her sick
husband made comfortable, then was her
hour of delight. She never allowed her
self but one hour of reading, fearing" it
would interfere with her needed rest, but
that one hour brought courage and cheer
fulness into her life, and as she. touch
ingly said to her visitor: 'It is all changed.
I have company in people and in books.
I can work, for I am never too sad to
work now. It has even made short the
long, dark winter days I used to dread
so much. It is all changed.' "
Benefits for the Children.
Among children the traveling libraries
are opening up a new life also. Some of
them, especially those selected for the re
mote districts, have been chosen with spe
cial reference to the needs and wishe
of the little people. Good pictures an-I
photographs are sent out with these books,
illustrating them. Pictures are very nec
essary to arouse children's interest. 1 They
learn more through seeing than reading.
This is especially true of children who
have been deprived of books and have
not formed the reading habit; it is only
by interesting them in pictures that they
can be brought to read the printed page.
Several of the library commissions pub
lish bulletins which give instructions to
women's clubs how to mount pictures,
their proper selection, use and care; also
giving lists of desirable cheap prints.
In the Delaware federation the State
library committee was given $100 to buy
books. After two years' f work the com
mittee reports twenty-six libraries trav
eling from school to school and from vil
lage to village.
The federation of Kansas has success
fully carried forward a traveling library
system until it became a State/ institu
tion, the last Legislature providing rooms
for headquarters, a secretary and an ap
propriation for books and expenses. The
president of the State federation is, by
virtue of her office, a member of the new
State Library Commission. The federa
tion turned over to. the State 3000 books
and forty shipping cases.
The Maine Federation of "Women's
Clubs has secured ( the enactment of â¢ a
law creating a State library commission
and also a bill to, establish traveling libra
ries. Forty traveling: libraries have al
ready been sent out.
Minnesota has also secured a State
library commission. In Missouri the State
federation has started the traveling libra
ries. ; There are forty of them, and' the
demand far exceeds the supply. They are
sent into the rem'ote districts of the State
and secure a warm welcome wherever
sent. This federation has also inaugu
rated travelins art galleries on the same
plan; the enterprise is in its infancy, but
the committee having- I_t in charge Is hope
ful of its success. The president of the
federation of Oklahoma Territory and In
dian Territory, writes t that, "through the
efforts of the clubs twelve libraries have
been founded in the two Territories."
Books for the Mountaineers.
The most unique phase of this work Is
its development under the fostering care
of the State Federations of Kentucky,
Tennessee and Georgia ; among the moun
tains of those States. Owing to the lack
of transportation facilities it has required
great perseverance and co-urag-e on the
part of the clubs, but they have won the
day and overcome all obstacles. In Ken
tucky there are flftv-flve libraries In cir
culation in the mountains, averaging fifty
five volumes to the box^-nearly 3000 books
The books are labeled, numbered, cata
logue* and supplied with the customary
bookmarks. History, fiction, travel, poet
ry, biography, the monthly periodicals
and books for^children form the bulk of
each box. The railroads in , Kentucky ar
ranged to receive and bill free all trav
eling libraries to the mountains; the rba(*s.
also sent directions to the library com
mittee for the routes over which the libra
ries must pass. This federation has also
made a beginning toward the traveling
picture library. The Jccal committee of
Louisville collected half-tones of scenery,
noted "people, colored prints of children,
flowers, fruits and birds, copies of the old
masters, artistic calendars and, above all,
reproductions Â¦ of World's Fair views.
These were mounted on gray cardboard
each finished with a brass eyelet for hang-
Ing. They were packed in lots of thirty
five each and sent with the ten boxes leav
ing Louisville. These pictures are forTr^a
distribution by the librarian who has
charge of the case in each district. A resi
dent of the county is selected as librarian
~-a clergyman, a school teacher, the prin
cipal merchant of the . town or som~
woman who is sufficiently 1 interested â¢ lii
the movement to allow the use of her
home. As nearly as oo?slble the plan of
the committee has BÂ«en carried outâ to

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS,
We admit that the spectacle is not novel. The cold
blooded lying in treaties and violation of every prin
ciple of honor in dealing with the Indian tribes have
smutted the history of a century. Dishonor has char
acterized every deal and contact with the Indians.
The hopeful tribes, which were our trustful allies in
wsr, have fared no bettor than those which ,were our
enemies. We have treated all alike, with impartial
"perfidy and villainy. This is the first time, however,
that our judicial establishment has taken a hand in the
game of dishonor.
Have the American people that quality called con
science about them? Has' any people ever preceded
us with less regard for plighted faith, when it is
pledged to the weak, who cannot resist its violation?
By parity of judicial * procedure a Federal Judge
could have before him rll the voters of a county and
put upon them fine and imprisonment, suspending sen
tence on condition that they vote his ticket.
This precious Judge is named John R. Thomas, and
hi? court sits at Muskogee. Describing 1 tlic proceeding,
he said: "The Snake band of Indians, who resisted
the enrollment under the Dawes Commission, are now
peaceable after encountering a United States Marsha!
and a troop of cavalry. I had 182 of thÂ»tm before my
court, every man on four different indictments. I gave
them a good talking to. sentenced each *or four years
and imposed an additional fine of $5000. Then I sus
pended sentence, and warned them that they had better
not resist the ratification of the Creek treaty. The
council for that ratification will be held June 2. The
Indians are now very tractable." *
The Dawes enrollment was a violation of the orig
inal treaty, and the new one supersedes it altogether.
This smug Judge, after ordering four years' imprison
ment and $5000 fine as' the penalty of upholding the
existing treaty, suspended sentence on condition that
the Creeks will not opocs# the new treaty. "The In
dians are now very tractable," no doubt." 3 .
The story is told by the Federal Judge before whon.'
these Indians were tried for the-offense of considering
the treaty made by Jackson with their fathers' a bind
ing obligation on them and the United States.
Rememberiugthat the original treaty recognized and
perpetuated *the tribal relation and tribal rights and.
laws, and that all the Snake leader did was to insist on
enforcement of the tribal laws, the subsequent pjo
ccedings have a rare interest and should make the
American people blush in the dark.
The first step in this conspiracy is the relinquishment
of tribal title in the Indian Territory. In order to ac
complish this a treaty has been made which the Indians
are required to ratify. A majority of the full-bloods are
bitterly opposed to it, a? are many of the half-castes.
The recent outbreak of the Snake band of Creeks was
onty a mode of expressing opposition to the treaty.
The far-sighted men in the four tribes have opened
negotiations for a grant of land in Mexico, declaring
that they will not live under a government that is
faithless, but will go to one that keeps its treaties
inviolate. These men. see the hopelessness of resist
ance, but others, with the fighting bloo-i of Push-ma
tth-ha in them, do not accept the situation with as
n;uch philosophy. These sympathized with the leader
of the Snake band, who led a forlorn hope, not to do
any illegal violence, but to rouse his tribesmen to
the conspiracy of the Oklahoma uiinexers. He
and hb men, who numbered a large force, surrendered,
the prominent ones were taken before the Federal
court and the rest were released.
Now, however, ' their fine territory is coveted by
white men. The politicians of Oklahoma have discov
ered that that Territory can never support a State gov
ernment, and so they want the rich area of the Indian
Territory added to it and the whole admitted as a
Slate. .
In this manner treaties were made with' the Creek?,
Cherokees, Choctaws and Chickasaws, by which they
exchanged their lands east of the Mississippi River
for land in the Indian Territory, which was to be held
as tribal property. These civilized tribes were to be
undisturbed in their new possessions, and have worked
out their destiny, prospering, individually and flour-:
ishing as tribes. They have many schools and- have
furnished a large number of highly educated men of
afteirs, who have achieved fame.
l' ; -
rROM the beginning of this Government the
Indian tribes have been treated as nations, and
the many treaties made with them have â¢ been
upon exactly the same basis as treaties with any of the
nations of the world.

There wu not a large crowd down to see
-de Toyo Klsen Kaisha's steamship Hong
kong Maru sail for the Orient yesterday
as she only took away a small list of cabin
passengers. There was one passenger for
Honolulu, R. B. Banning. He was par
ticularly anxious to get to the Islands,
â¢and as there is no vessel that flies the
American flag leaving: until the 17th inst.,
he determined to pay upon his ar
rival 5200 penalty imposed by the
Government and took passage on the
Hongkong Maru. Mr. Banning's trip,
therefore, will cost him $275. He is a capi
talist. Interested in Hawaiian securities,
and the chances are that some news he re
ceived by the China took him to the
Islands in a hurry.
When Mr. Banning applied to the agents
of the Japanese steamship he was at first
refused a passage. He then appealed to
Collector of the Port Stratton and that
gentleman allowed him to go with the
understanding that the fine is to be paid in
Honolulu.
The Toyo Kisen Kalsha boats seem to be
the onlv ones that are breaking 1 the law.
Their last steamship from the Islands
brought up two passengers, who are sup
posed to have paid the fine, and now the
Hongkong Maru goes out with a third.
The question now is, "How many Hono
lulu passengers will the Doric and the
Xippon Maru bring: up with them?"
The cabin passengers on the Hongkong
Maru and those who will Join at Honolulu
are as follows:
For TIcnolulu â B. R. Banning.

NEW YORK, April 3.â An astonishing muta
tion of speculative sentiment was demonstrated
by the action of the stock market to-day.
There was not a sign of the distress and acute
anxiety under which the market labored all
day* yesterday. It is the almost invariable
rule that such a violent break in prices as
that of yesterday brings in overnight an ac
cumulation of selling orders from alarmed
holders of stock who wait for dally reports for
their information Â¦ on the stock market, ' but
the opening this morning was quiet and un
ruffled, with no important pressure to sell and
with many notable advances Induced by the de
mand of the shorts to cover. : Before the day
was over the bull leaders had recovered their
lull control of the situation and were marking
up prices and attracting large followings with
all the facility which has characterized their
operations for many weeks past. There was
very palpable manipulation and there were
carefully organized operations to support the
market. Commission-houses which were prom
inent in bidding up Blocks and which have
acted for large speculative. interests all through
the recent bull campaign were free tenders of
money below the rate offered by. the banks at
the same time that they were buying stocks.
The rumor of the Burlington deal was rehabil
itated and had apparently not lost any of its
force, although official confirmation -was* still
conspicuously lacking. There was revived
credulity in many other rumors which have al
reedy done good service, including that of the
supposed readjustment of General Electric's
capital and the Southwestern railroad merger.
The settlement of the internal dissensions in
the American Smelting Company, the advance
In the price of refined sugars and the absence
of any engagement of gold for export by to
morrow's steamer were- all used with effect by
the bulls. Advances reached 6 points in Bur
lington and Rock Island and Northwestern, 3%
In Northern Pacific, 4 In Texas and Pacific, 4
in Chicago and Eastsrn Illinois, 3% in Met
ropolitan, 3 in Western Union, 3% in Con
solidated Gas, 4 in Amalgamated Copper, Sugar
2%. United States 'Express 5%, Rubber 4(4,
Rubber preferred 8% and the majority of the
principal active stocks .from 1 to 2 points. Only
in one or two cases wÂ«ie the gains fully main
tained,- reactions running from, 1 to 2%, but
the market was vigorously supported again and Â¦
the close was irregular. The pressure of
profit-taking was not notably heavy even at
the advances. Apparently the speculative hold
ers of stocks were determined to hold for a
further rise unless they were forced Into liqui
dation by calling of loans or by wiping out
of margins. There was much less calling ! of
leans to-day than yesterdaj' and this called
attention to several causes for special pressure
in yesterday's money market. To-day's clear
ing-house statement - disclosed the enormous
total of exchanges of J437.SS2.9S0, which is over
$12,000,000 in excess of the largest previous
day's record in the history of the clearing
house. The general activity of the stock mar- j
ket yesterday had something to do with this, j
but the settlement growing out of the ' clear
ances in the contracts to deliver the United |
States Steel stocks wheu Issued was . a special |
factor. The easier meney in London to-day j
lessened! the demand for exchange and the rate j
for sterling yielded a fraction. Yesterday's
heavy liquidation has caused some natural re
lief to the money market. There was not lack-
Ing a suspicion that yesterday's violent relapse
was winked at if not connived In by sold-out j
bull leaders either to enable them to get in
at the lower prices or to shake out a weak fol- '
lowing and relieve the ccndltion of over specu
lation.
The bond market was Irregular. Total sales,

Weather Report
The report of A. G. -McAdie, section director
of the climate and crop service of the Weather
Bureau, for the week ending Monday, is as
follows :
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been several degrees be
low normal in all parts of the State during the
Â«~ k and severe frosts have occurred in the
central and northern portions and in some
parts of Southern California. Light rain has
fallen in all sections and in some places the
precipitation has been sufficient to improve tha
rendition of cram, hay and green feed. A hail
storm occurred on the ZA in Oakland and other
places, but caused no damage. Dry northerly
winds have prevailed in some sections to the
detriment of all crops.
Early sown grain is generally in good condi
tion and making satisfactory growth, but the
late sown is less thritty and shows the effects
of the doing winds and lack of rain. With
a tenerous rainfall in the next two weeks, it
is believed the wheat crop will be above the
average in all parts of the State. Barley and
ofcts are in fair condition and will probably
yield average crops. There will also be a good
crop of hay in most sections. Grain and wild
oats are being cut for hay in Southern Cali
fornia. Green feed is becoming scarce in some
places. Early vegetables have been consider
ably injured by fi-ost.
There are many reports of serious damage
to deciduous fruits by frosts during the week,
especially in the central and northern districts.
In some parts of the Sacramento Valley and
the northern coast counties it is reported that
the entire crop has been killed, but later re
ports will doubtless contradict .this. There
will probably.be a considerable loss on apricots,
grapes, peaches and prunes, and some dam
ape to early i^ears and other fruits. â¢
SACRAMENTO VALLEYâ The unfavorable
weather conditions during the week have seri
ously impaired crop prospects in nearly all
parts of the valley. Temperature considerably
below normal and dry northerly winds have
been detrimental to grain and hay, and severe
frosts have injured early vegetables, deciduous
fruits and grapes. The extent of the damage
to fruit cannot be estimated at present but
reports show that there will be a heavy loss
on grapes, apricots, peaches, prunes and al
monds in many places, and that figs, walnuts
and early pears have been considerably injured.
Light showers in some sections have been
beneficial. Grajn is in rood condition in most
Places, but needs rain. Green feed is becoming
scarce.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONSâ Cool weather
has prevailed during the week and severe frosts
have occurred in many places. Light rain has
fallen in nearly all sections, improving the con
dition of grain and hay. Fruit In the central
aj^d northern counties appears to have been
mere seriously injured by frosts than In the
southern coast counties, where It â¢ Is reportÂ»d
the damage is very light. In Alameda, Son
oma, Napa ar.d Fan Mateo counties grapes and
deciduous fruits have been considerably dam
ajred. but the extent of the loss cannot yet be
tstiniated. Some of the large orchards were'
protected by emudging, as timely warnings
had been given. Grain and hay are In good
condition, but needing rain in the southern
counties.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYâ Generally clear
and cold weather has prevailed during the past
week, with frequent frosts, which In some lo
calities have ereatly damaged vines and apri
cots and caused some damage to peaches The
Reneral impression Is that the frosts have not
ratified as much damage as was at first antici
pated. Licht rhoweru fell quite generally on
Saturday, but in most sections were not of ma
terial benefit. Rain is b^dly needed in all
nerts of the valley. Ucrly sown grain is in
excellent condition, but late sown, especially on
f=sn<iy soil, is suffering for rain. Present pros
pects are favorable for a good fruit crop.
Alfalfa looks well and green feed is still
plentiful in most districts. North winds pre
v;)ilÂ«sl the greater portion of the week. ThÂ«
eriund in most place? -is too hard to work
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAâ The temperature
has been below normal during the week and
frof.ts hive occurred in some places, slightly
injuring apricots and early potatoes. The light
slKwerÂ» were very beneficial to hay and grain
hut more rain Is needed for late sowji wheat
ar<1 hay. Apricots are dropping and the yleid
will 1* light in some section*. Other decidu
ous fruits and Tralm:ts are advancing rapidly
ar.S locking Trell. Wheat and barley have
fr-nir.ep.ced headrnf out. Volunteer grain Is
to'Ing' cut for hey.
J^os Arjreles summaryâ Cold vtp*k with frost
l>n.ir>age reported in some localities: none In
rr'".<*rs. Morning of the fth the coldest In April
on rroord at Lns Angeles, with heavy to kill
ir.~ frost on low grounds.
Kureka fuir.maryâ Gardens are backward on
af-.fv.unt of -continued cold weather and hieh
â¢v^rth winds. Heavy frosts but no material
reported. Grafs is good end the fruit
cutlcok excellent.
WHAT THE WEATHER BUREAU SAYS
ABOUT THE PREVAILING CONDITIONS.
The Weather and Crops.
ilail advices from New York say:
"Prunes continue to be the most active ar
ticle in dried fruits, but trade is more on the
hend-to-mouth order than it has been. The
scarcity of E0-â¬0s is now very marked, and
fome holders ask mere than the spot equiva
lent of association goods. A little business was
.heard of, however, at 5%c. A number of care
Â«'t this size are- tn route from California ami
due to arrive in a few days. Several cars of
Â£0-C0s, association pack, which have been
shipped on- consignment, are among the num
l>er, and from present appearances, should sell
i-eadily en arrival. Spot stocks of 40-50s are
net' plentiful, and C0-70s and 90-100s are Bcarcc.
"Raisins are selling in a email way to the
regular trade. It Is understood a sale of 1000
boxes of 3-crown California loose has been
made to a seeder, but no particulars could be
learned. Demand for seeded is light. Apricots
are in a bad way and there are offerinzs at
all sorts of prices, with almost nb dispositio-i
to buy. Peaches continue oasy, with only a
small business doinff. ,.-.
Â¦â¢Dates are about steady at 3Vtc for Hallowi.
Ic for Khadrawi and 2%<J?2%c for Salrs. Dates
are slow sellers at present, but holders expect
a better demand to set in soon. Figs are going
out quite f:-eely. Bag figs are hard to findL

are very dull and easy."

TACOMA, April 9.â Local agitation over
the employment of married women as
teachers in public, schools has become
more fierce than ever in consequence of
the dismissal of a young woman who was
married last week during the Easter va
cation. Her pay was stopped at once,
though ishe J expected to teach until the
school year ended in June: The School
Board announces that this rule will be en
forced hereafter in all such cases. The
teachers in Tacoma include several mar
ried women who remain only because they
are efficient and had commenced work in
the Tacoma schools before the present
agitation was started.
Four members of the School Board de
clare their belief that domestic duties
will more or less interfere with the work
of a teacher and that those who are mar
ried should step ou,t in favor of young
women who need employment. Mrs. Ella
FifieldT M. D., the only woman member
of the board, stands up for her sex and
holds that, efficiency should be the only
test laid down for teachers.

OAKLAND, April 9.â One lone wo
man camped out over an incipient
'posthole In the sidewalk has de
fled the united forces of the Bay
Counties Light and Power Com
pany and the Oakland Gas Light and Heat
Company since 1 o'clock to-day. At last
accounts Miss Mary Kelly, the belligerent
on the'short end of the unequal contest,
was in triumphant possession. ' ,
The battle began as soon as* the sappers
of the allies' returned from lunch to the
task of advancing their line up Franklin
street from Fifth. - Just before knocking
off work for the noon hour they had be
gun with chisels and crowbars the job of
cutting out a section of. the cement walk
in front of Miss Kelly's property at the
corner of Sixth and Franklin streets. Miss
Kelly viewed the proceedings from her
front window with stern disapproval. She
has braved the storm of many a winter
undismayed and soon mapped out a plan
of action to prevent the installment of
one of the Bay Counties' towering poles
in front of her premises. When the hench
men of the illuminating: monopoly renewed
the attack they found Miss Kelly stoutly
intrenched over their intended excavation,
her feet firmly planted on her constitu
tional rights and the rungs 'of one of her
dining-room chairs.
"Go on now," warned the irate proprie
tress; "off .with you. It's never a pole
you'll plant here?'': '
The enemy called" a hurried council of
war on the southwest, corner of the streets
aforementioned. * An envoy was sent to
Miss Kelly bearing smoothly worded, over
tures of peace ahd good will. A compro-

TACOMA, April 3.â George Hazzard of
this city,, a Democrat of national reputa
tion, has devised a plan whereby the na
tional committeemen and chairmen of the
State committees of all the States west
of the Missouri River, together with those
of Indiana and Illinois, "are to sign a' joint
invitation asking Senator David B. Hill
of New York to make an extended cam
paign tour of the West during the Con
gressional campaign in : the Â¦ fall of 1902.
This is understood to be part of a care
fully planned movement by which it is
sought to make Hill the standard bearer
of the Democratic party in 1904. An effort
will be made to have Senator Hill extend
his' trip to Alaska. After the invitation
has been presented and accepted the prep
aration of an itinerary for the trip will be
left to the Democratic Congressional Com

STARTING THE BOOM
FOR DAVID B. HILL
Miss Kelly has an established reputa
tion as a redoubtable fighter. She owns
considerable property, which . she man
ages with firmness and thrift.
The line in dispute is that by which the
Bay Counties Company is to' deliver the
current contracted for by the Oakland Gas
Light and Heat Company. "They expected
to turn on. the. electricity by the 1st of
May, but that was before they took Miss
Kelly into their reckoning.
"I might have consented to your put
ting, up the pole If you had gone about it
right," she said: "now you can see my
nephew, Hiram Luttrell. He's a lawyer
and has charge of my business. And you
needn't expect," by way of parting advice,
"you can dig it after dark. I'll be right
here."
"I guess it would be assault 'n' bat
tery," suggested the' man tentatively to
the foreman, and desisted.
The proposition to undermine the lady's
position and let her fall into the hole
seemed to obviate this legal technicality,
but then you never know what the law
may do to you, so the gapg decided on a
siege as the safest and surest way out of
the difficulty.
"I'll have my meals brought to me,
t sald Miss Kelly discouragingly. /
By this time the street was blocked with
a gathering crowd. The little woman on
the chair was a ten-to-one favorite. De
risive bits of advice and ironical condol
ences were showered upon the pick-and
shovel brigade until they found the vi
cinity too uncomfortable for further oc
cupancy. They drifted up the street and
began to dig holes easier to complete.
Meanwhile delegations Oi the officials of
the company arrived to look over the sit
uation, but Miss Kelly would treat with
no one but'President Britton.
Â¦ ~ f m
mlse was proposed. Miss Kelly . was ob
durate. She scoffed.
"Don't talk to me," she .said, "barrin*
you send Mr. : Britton."
"Dig around the chair," proposed one
of the sang. A-workman raised a crow
bar to strike; one of Miss Kelly's feet
came off the chair and covered the spot
at which the blow was aimed.

monial. He everywhere met with the
heartiest reception from the crowds.
At the banquet this evening Jn honor of
th<^ Russian officers M. Loubet proposed
tlie health of the Czar, "who in sending
you hither to salute the President of the
French republic has proved once more the
constancy of his sentiment for a friendly
ullipd nation."
President Ix>ubet and M. Delcasse re
< eived Admiral Blriloff and four- other
KuFFian naval officers who had disem
lifirked at Villefranohe.
President Loubet subsequently repaired
to the Port of Nice, three-quarters of a
mile away, where he was welcomed by
the Chamber of Commerce and visited the
hospitals. He was everywhere warmly
greeted. At a banquet later and replying
to a toaet to his health, President Loubet
asserted that the principles of justice, sol
idarity and crood will were the founda
tion off the republic and inseparable to
Franco. He said the country needed unity
an/1 concord ar.d that the conflicts of in
t'.rests and the country's increasing wants
wr.uld end In compromising the future of
ihp nation unless steps were taken to
ameliorate social conditions. Solidarity
and civil peace could not be secured ei
rÂ«pt by reciprocal sacrifices. Continuing,
I'lf-sid^nt i/oubet said that private inter
ests must be subordinated to the greater
interest? of the nation. The republic had
jilready Fhown in its legislation an appre
ciation of the necessities of the labor
"nrarizations. but legislation alone would
not sviflior 1 . The give and take proposi
tion must bocome part of the conscle.nce
<>f the nation. Thus could the country
v. old its unity and assure its moral gran
o>ur and prosperity. President Loubet's
s^pooch was loudly applauded. '
NICE. April 9.â President Loubet, ac
companied by the French Ministers and
othrr officials, placed a crown of flowers
upon Gambetta's tomb. He expressed the
hope that the French Parliament -would
soon vote to transfer the remains to the
Pantheon. It Is proposed that this be ac
complished by July 34 next, the French
rational holiday.

. The new armor is made in accordance
with a patent taken out by a Mr. Cos
grove, who arranged with the Cartton
Steel Company for the manufacture of ex
perimental plates. By this process the
mold in which the whole steel ingot from
which an armor plate is cast la filled with
plumbago core. Soft steel is then poured
in, filling other half of mold. When thl*
has cooled to a point where It will not run
the core is taken out and Its place Is filleJ
with very hard steel. The plate is then
finished by being rolled instead of forged.
The result is said to be a plate with a
very hard face, which resists the penetra
tion of a projectile, combined with a soft
back, which prevents the plate from being:
fractured. ! The idea of a hard face anil
soft back is old, but the difficulty incurred
heretofore has been to get a perfect joint
between the hard and soft metals. It 1.-4
claimed that this difficulty has been com
pletely overcome in the new plate.
An experimental plate manufactured by
an entirely new process has recently been
shipped from the works of the Carbon
Steel Company in Pittsburg to the naval
ordnance proving ground at Indian Head,
to be subjected to the regulation ballistic
test. Upon the result of this test will de
pend any further experiments which may
lesult from the adoption by the Govern
ment of this new armor instead of that
for which the Nevy Department la now

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. X.
W., WASHINGTON, April 9.-The armo

ONE NIGHT IN MUNICH
AT THE PAVILION ANNEX
Preparations for the Entertainment
Next Saturday Night Nearly-
Completed.
FOR the ladies of the California
Club, who have been so busy ar
ranging the industrial art exhibi
tion at the Mechanics' Pavilion,
the "end now crowns the work,"
and the attractive display is ready for the
public verdict, and for the formal opening
this evening. This afternoon the "private
view" will be had, the club entertaining 1
its friends in the midst of the gathered
art treasures.
For the first time this year the club has
assigned a section to high art, and this
was put into the competent hands of Mrs.
George Law Smith and her committee.
The result is niost satisfactory. .Artists
whose names are sounded far beyond their
Cahfornian homes have painted especially
for this exhibit. Of the 181 paintings ex
hibited, not one is more than five years
old, and many are exhibited for the first
time. Several critics and connoisseurs
have assured Mrs. Smith and her ..asso
ciates that this is really the most, repre
sentative and the most excellent exhibi
tion of paintings given In San Francisco
for three years. Keith. Tavernier ana all
tho best names are found here, Keith's
large painting. "A Spring Morning," be
ing now on view for the first time. The
hanging is notably well done, and the pic
tures have so exceeded in number the
places arranged for them that an "over
flow" display will be found at the en
trance.
Several admirable collections of minia
tures are found in this section, among
them those of Miss Prather, Miss Nettie
King, Oscar Kunath and Mrs. Hazle
hurst. A miniature copy of the Gains
borough "Duchess of Devonshire," which
has just created such a stir by coming
to light after years of hiding, will attract
attention.
Among the exhibitors from. out of town
in this section are Miss Kleinsorge of Sac
ramento and Miss Edith White of Los
Angeles.
The Federation of Western Addition Im
provement Clubs met last evening at

report, which was adopted and the name
of the organization was permanently fixed
as "The Federation of Improvement Clubs
of Western San Francisco" and its scope
as "all the territory contained in the dis
trict north of Market street and the ex
tension and west of Powell street." Each
bona fide improvement club in this section
will select and credential five delegates to
comprise this central body.
A committee on credentials Â¦ was ap
pointed, consisting of William H. Miller,
John Henderson and Will P. Johnson.
Upon motion of John J. Cassidy a voto
of thanks was extended to the Board of

"We finally decided to have him quit tea
and coffee and try Postum Food Coffee.
He dates -his recovery from the day he
commenced to drink Postum, and has not
bad to stop work from sickness since then.
: "Some years ago I tried a package of
I'ostum and did not like it. but I know
now that it was because 'I -"did not make it
right. It Is easy to make good Postum if
the simple directions are followed. The
only failure is when people do not boil It
long enough. ~y* Â«-,
The husband ahd father was taken sick
with a very severe attack of stomach
trouble and had to give up work, being
confined to the house for some weeks, suf-
fering greatly. For some time he had been
in the habit of drinking coffee for break-
fast and tea for dinnei* and supper. Tho
wife writes. "After leading some of your
advertisements we wondered if coffee and
tea had not been the cause of his sickness.
A lady up in Oakes, N. D.. says that
since their family have been drinking
Pos-tum the children are stronger and
better than ever before, and are so glad
to think they can have coffee to drink
"just like papa."
If children can be given a{ strong, nour-
iphing food drink such as Postum Food
Coffee it more than catisfles their desire
lo have things like the older folks, and
f.t the same time gives them a drink they
love and fatten on.
Perhaps you can remember the time
Â¦when a forkful of the meat or po-
tato or a sip from the cup that your
Father or Mother was using seemed to
possess some remarkable merit and flavor.
More than any of the old folks realize,
the little folks at the table like to have
fnod ard drink the same as Father and
Mother.
Like the Parents.

TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL LANDS.
The Montezuma Mlnlne Company, In connec-
tion with the Washington Co-operative Syndi-
cate, has leased for twenty years 1800 acre*
of the finest coal landj in Washington, so that
to-day there Is no Ik- tier proposition In the
State. We have some twelve veins of coal
from four to nine feet In width, wtth an aver-
age lift of 2000 feet. atiJ four miles In length.
W* have approximately some fifty million tons
of coal. We have one vein of coal nine feet
two Inches In width that is pure coal except
some two Inches of bone; the analysis shows it
to be without a superior In the State. I give
you herewith the analysts: Moisture, 1.60 per
cent; volatile. 34.25 per cent; fixed carbon, 62.00
per cent; ash, J.I5 per cent. We will have In
this vein over seven million tons of coal above
water level, and nearly as much below. The |
other eleven veins, although not as large, -would
give us a vast amount of coal. I need not say
that the magnitude of our coal proposition Is a
large one; we shall expect before many months
to be shipping a large &:nount of coal per day.
A part of our veins are fine coking coal. As a
portion of our coal maU< -, the best of coke, and
as each oven will earn about $3 per day in
making coke, and with an unlimited demand,
this part of our business will be exceedingly
profitable. Our coal property Is a little over
one mile from the railroad at Fairfax, where
we are opening up our' coal. We have about
600 feet elevation, and fcliall have our bunkers
at the railroad and run our coal to the bunkers
In a flume, havlng'plenty of water for this pur-
pose and also to run all of our machinery, so
that all the handling* of our coal will be done
automatically, which means cheaply.
We have with both of pur companies money
enough on hand to put our coal property In
shipping order. So that we expect to be
shipping coal In May, and shall, I believe, be
able to commence paying dividends In August,
1301.â Letter from C. "iV. Thompson, President.
DmDENDS.THIS TEAR.
Our coal mines alone will, pay big dividends
to all shareholders when same are run. at full
capacity (about thirty men being at, present
employed, the force to be Increased as rapidly
as development will permit), and as soon as we
begin turning out "copper matte" from the
smelter these dividends will be very materially
Increased. The net proceeds of each mine are
paid m dividnds to the share holders; not one
dollar of such funds can be used for develop-
ment work.
STOCK "ADVANCING. 'Â¦
The price of the btock of the Montezuma
Mining Company is advancing every month,
and Is liable any month to make some big
Jumps. These expectations are based upon the
following facts:
Firstâ Because the company has a large cap-
italization, which Is fte.irly all treasury stock.
It has been the experience of the past that all
mining- companies having a large amount of
treasury stock have Deen able to successfully
develop their properties, because by the sale of
euch stock they have obtained sufficient work-
ing capital for all the purposes of securing and
developing their propeities, . while companies
with a small amount of such stock have failed
from a lack of sufficient working capital.
The capitalization and organization plans of
the "Montezuma" are such that with honest
management failure is absolutely an impossi-
bility, and the company must necessarily be-
come a great controlling power of the vast
mineral products of the Paclnc 'Coast. >
THE POOR MAN'S CHANCE:.
The man or woman earning wages Investing
$5. $10, $15 or more per month for the next few
months in this stock may, and most likely will
In the near future receive In dividends every
month a greater income than their present
earnings.
People who make monthly deposits In banks
may reasonably expect much larger returns by
putting the same into the purchase of the stock
of this company; and those with a good bank
account will, without doubt, find It the best
Investment on the market at the present time.
There has been no time In the past when the
banker and the public generally could Invest
money as safely in purchasing the stock of a
company, based upon a large capitalization,
with valuable mineral . properties and doing a
legitimate mining business, with such absolute
Â£ insurance of large returns as at the present
time. * Â¦
The risks are so small and the prospects so
large that it seems to us that no one with the
slightest ambition to improve his financial con-
dition need have any nesitation in purchasing
this stock while he can do so at the present low
price. In a short time the price of the stock
will so advance that none but the rich can pur-
chase it, when the best opportunity of a life-
time will be lost to you. . .. - - Â¦â¢
WHY A SAFE INVESTMENT.
Because the company owns (or controls by
long lease) 1000 acres of rich copper properties
and 1800 acres of the best steam and coking
coal in the State of Washington. â¢ -â¢'-Â¦
Because . there Is a constantly increasing de-
mand for copper, the price for same being
more than double what it was a few years ago.
Because first-class steaming and blacksmlth-
Ing coal and coke are <n such demand on the
Pacific Ccast that the cempany could not sup-
ply one-half of the present requirement of the
market if they were producing at full capacity.
Because the "Montezuma" employs only the
most skilled mining engineers to be found on
the -continent, hesitating at no reasonable ex-
pense to determine the absolute- value of their
mines.
Because the Montezuma Mining Company 1s
organized under the laws of the State of Wash-
ington, where protection is afforded the Investor
against fraud and misrepresentation.
Because Its Managers and Directors are men
well known for their high moral character and
business abilityâ particularly skilled In mining
and financiering. . â¢
Because the company Incurs No Debts, thus
running no risk of a financial crash or panic in
the commercial world. Do you realize the im-
portance of this? The people of this country
are slowly recovering from a great financial de-
pression; a few years of prosperity are before
us, and then will 3urely come the regular
period of distress, but It will affect only such
institutions as are struggling under a heavy
load of debt. . , â¢ Â¦ ,
The Montezuma Company has No Bonded In-
debtedness.- Its stock Is Non- Assessable. "Its
management is unsurpassed. Its products can
be easily and cheaply marketed. Nowhere in
the world can copper and coal be produced
more cheaply.
J. D. Mclntyre, consulting engineer for the
"Montezuma," says in his late report on the
Coal property: "The total or approximate esti-
mate of coal within the boundaries of your
coal lands Is 21.621,600 tons," which would give
an output of 1000 Tons Daily for a Period of 75
Tears; 300 days to the year.
A BIG, SAFE COMPANY.
Large capitalization insures the cimplete de-
velopment of all the properties now under con-
trol or that may hereafter be acquired by the
company. A development fund Is created by
the sale of shares, and from no other source.
The tendency of the wcrld of action now Is in
all directions toward -combination of capital and
i ability in great enterprises. The time has gone
by when the Individual alone, single-handed,
can make a great success. So It Is in mining
enterprises. The companies of large capitaliza-
tion, commanding, as they do, large resources,
are the successful ones. Such companies pro-
tect their stockholders In all of their rights and
interests, and return to them large dividends.
The losses people meet with In such Investments
are always in the small companies, for the
simple reason that their capital is too small to
j successfully carry out their undertakings.
FUTURE PROSPECTS. â¢
Every man and woman has a desire to Im-
prove his or her financial prospects.
Every man and woman who had the gift of
an Independent Judgment, and the courage, re-
gardless of the possibilities then existing that
every dollar he invested might be lost, to pur-
chase 10OO shares .or more of the stock In the
following companies and held on to it, are now
classed among the wealthy people of the coun-
try-
The purchaser of 1050 shares of stock In the
follov.-ing companies, when it was first offered
to the public at a merely nominal price, would
now have the following valuations:
In the Calumet and Hecla $760,000,
In the Boston and Montana 327,000
In the Tamarack ,...: 194.000
In the Qulncy 137,000
In the Anaconda ;.V ".. 26,250
In the Isabella 112,000
In the Raven W.300
In the Osceola 70,000
In the Standard 315,000
In the Butte and Bcston S1.000
The above list represents only I a few of the
large number of mining companies that have
made enormous fortunes for their stockholders.
' PRICE OF MONTEZUMA STOCK. --
The par value of Moutezuma* stock Is $1 per
Ehare. For a short time it is offered at 10c
each or I2oon rr.onth'y Installments.'
These prices are far below the real value, but
the company wishes to carry out Its co-operat-
ive Idea, making Its shares acceptable to a
wide range of customers. This stock has in-
creased in value 100 per cent since we began
its sale a short time and .will make a like
advance within the next few months. A block
of this stock of numerate size will In a few
years provide a. competency for th,e owner.
Remember, the holder of this stock will- share
In the profits of both the copper, and: the coal
mines. .\

nl Ideal companies.
WASHINGTON COPPER MINES.
Perhaps the largest copper deposits in the
world lie In the State of Washington; they were
Ciscovfcred and development work begun In
Forae sections only a few years ago; the oldest '
of these mines are great producers to-day and
pre making fortunes for the holders of the
etock.
THE MONTEZUMA MINING COMPANY.
This newest and at the same time the largest
of copper companies In Washington offers pre-
cisely the same opportunities that thousands of
people lave grasped to their profit. It has
twenty-four fine properties in the famous Car-
bon River and Tahoma districts at the base of
Kount Rainier, fifty-two miles from Tacoma,
one cf the most favored mining regions in the
world, by reason of *he large bodies of low-
Erade ore, its proximity to rail and water trans- '
portatlon, and the abundance of timber and
water en the properties themselves. This and
adjacent regions have already produced values
amounting to $100,000,000, antl the output has
hardly commenced.
The company is capitalized at $10,000,000, of
which JS.OOO.OOO is treasury stock, non-assess-
able under the laws of Washington.
Trie four properties of the "Tacoma" group
ere destined to become one of the most pro-
ductive mines on ths Pacific Coast. These
â¢lone, when developed, will bring the company's !
stock to par. The ore is thown in a vein thirty
feet wide, which is traceable on the surface of
the whole width of the company's holdings. The
Tacoma tunnel has basn driven over one hun-
dred feet in 6olid ore. running over $60 to the
ton. There are fifteen distinct veins of minerals
in the company's properties, and it Is not un-
reasonable to expect that as many more will
come to light as the properties are developed.
THE ASSAYS.
The following Is the result of ten assays taken
from samples of ore in the tnnnel of the Ta-
coma mine of the Montezuma Company:

HIGH PERCENTAGES OF COPPER.
"The high peroentacres of copper in these
northern deposits are what -will attract the at-
tention of the mining world. It is nothing un-
usual for them to run from 25 to 7S per cent of
copper. What these high percentages mean will
be better understood when it Is known that the
Calumet and Hecla mine of Michigan Is paying
dividends this year (1SO0) of $40,000,000 from
ore carrying only 4 per cent copper."â San
Francisco Chronicle.
A NEW RAILROAD.
The power plant for an electric railroad is al-
ready completed, and tiie laying of the track Is'
only waiting the development of the ore bodies
so that fifty tons of ore a day can be mined.'
This will enable the Montezuma Company to
place its ore at the Tacoma smelter for $4 25
per ton. and at the rÂ«*w Fairfax smelter for
one-fourth of that amount.-^(See dispatch In
The Examiner of March 21 for railroad building
to mines.)
DIVIDENDS.
All moneys received from the profits of the
Montezuma mines will be paid in dividends to
<he shareholders. Such funds cannot be rein-
vested in the company. Tne opening of the
mines and all expenses incident thereto must
be provided for out of the sale of Pharos until
returns are ' obtainable from the properties.
Stockholders will rem amber that in purchasing
shares in this company they at once become in-
terested in all the properties owned by them.
THE VALUE OF CJOOD MANAGEMENT.
The success of a mining property depends in
a large measure upon the integrity and knowl-
edge of its management.
C. W, Thompson, pr-sident, is also president
.of the Washington Co-operative Syndicate (a
dividend payer), was manager of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company's mining interests for
five years in Dakota, Idaho and Washington.
Thomas Carroll, trustee 'and vice president;
Judge of the Superior Court of Pierce County.
Clark Davis, trustee; register of the Univer-
sity of Washington.
E. M. Ehelton, trustee: late instructor in agri-
culture to the Government of Queensland, Aus-
tralia.
J. M. Williamson, trustee; Judge of the Su-
perior Court of Pierce County.
J. D. Mclntyre, consulting engineer, was for
years chief engineer of the Homestake mine.
South Dakota.
EXAMINATION OF THE PROPERTIES.
Investors have only to see the properties to
appreciate their worth. With a view to en-
courage subscriptions tc the stock In a large
way we will give intending investors every op-
portunity to examine the mines where 200,000
or more shares are contemplated on a cash
basis. We will be glad to arrange with such
for sharing the expenses of examination.

COrOPERATION AND CONSOLIDATION.
Co-operation and consolidation are tha watch-
words of the business world to-day. The enter-
prises which make money for their owners are
those which are operated In the largest possible
way and with the greatest economy of manage-
ment. The Montezuma Mining Company has
been organized with these great facts of modern
business life fully in view. It owns and controls
twenty-four <24) mining properties, and expects
soon to acquire others. This policy Is pursued
because business experience has taught that
only by thus consolidating interests can be had
the most efficient mano^njent. combined with
the lowest operating expenses, and. consequent-
ly, the largest profit. Instead of a dozen or
more feeble, struggling companies, each having
its official end technical staff, the Montezuma
operates an entire group of mines with its sin-
gle, highly trained and efficient management.
Investors will not bs clow to perceive that this
jtolicy of consolidation and co-operation < means
tcr them a concentration of values in the stock
of the company. Every single share really rep-
resents a'.l that is back of many -shares in
Eir.a'.ler companies.

THREE EASTER
WEEK WEDDINGS
The combination of the companies doing
a trading: and transportation business In
Alaska, of which exclusive advance infor
mation was given in The Call, has been
; effected. All the corporations that have
been largely identified with the business
have agreed to unite in two corporations
with one exception, Â£his belng ; the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company, in which the Cudahys and the
AVeares of Chicago are the moving spirits.
Why the Chicago concern chose to remain
outside of the combination and what ac
tion this may. portend .s not known here.
The corporations that have agreed to
unite are the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, the Alaska Exploration Company,
the Seattle- Yukon Transportation Com
pany and the Empire Transportation Com
pany. The last named i* the Pacific Coast
branch of the International Navigation
Company.
A meeting of representatives of the sev
eral companies Involved in the deal was
held yesterday afternoon, after which in-,
.formation was griven out officially. Wil
liam Thomas of Thomas & Gerstle. attor
neys, who have acted in the making of the
deal, was also present.
Two Corporations Formed.
Two corporations have been provided for
under the laws of New Jersey and the
papers are now on the way to that State.
The Northen Navigation Company will
take over all the assets of the old corpora
tions enumerated that axe connected Â¦with
transportation - in the northern country
and will be known as the Northern Navi
gation Company. This will be handled as
a separate corporation and will do a pure
ly transportation business. It Is capital
ized at $3,250,000. The other corporation
will be known as the Northern Commer
cial company, capitalized at $7,000,000. It'
Â¦will take over all the plants and stocks of
merchandise now under the control of th3 ;
four companies named in the territory de- '
scribed, which includes the Yukon, S'..
Michael, Bering Sea and Port Clarence
districts.
The principal offices of the new com
. panies will be at San P"rancisco. Seattle,
Victoria and Vancouver. The officers of
the companies will 3e chosen at the first
meeting of the directors, who have not
yet been named. It v/as eiven out that
the purposes are to afford better facilities;
to aid in the develooir.ent of the country:
to reduce the price of supplies, which can
be done by reason of the saving in having
to sustain only one set of plants instead
of several: to provide against any possible
shortage of supplies in the north in the
future, and to make a legitimate profit in
the reduction of expenditures, which un
der the conditions existing In late years
have been large.
Property Involved in Deal.
The original purpose, when the subject
matter was taken unier consideration,
was to arrive at some understanding for
the maintenance of transoortation rates
and to remedy various' conditions. As the
discussion progressed the scheme was en
larged so that It has lesulted as related
in the foregoing.
Included in the transfer of properties
are thirty-six river boats, launches and
barges, but" no ocean steamers. Neither
are there any mining properties in the
doal. During the present year only ths
companies will operate the ocean steamers
Commaugh. Portland. St. Paul and Dora
ancl also sailing vessels and steamers un
der charter. Those present when the news
was given out said that there was no
stock deal in the matter. No statement
was made concerning the proportions In
which the stockholders in the old corpora
tions will receive shares in the new one.
